Abstract
The objective of this review is to provide an overview of intermittent fast-
ing regimens, summarize the evidence on the health benefits of intermit-
tent fasting, and discuss physiological mechanisms by which intermittent
fasting might lead to improved health outcomes. A MEDLINE search was
performed using PubMed and the terms “intermittent fasting,” “fasting,”
“time-restricted feeding,” and “food timing.” Modified fasting regimens ap-
pear to promote weight loss and may improve metabolic health. Several lines
of evidence also support the hypothesis that eating patterns that reduce or
eliminate nighttime eating and prolong nightly fasting intervals may result
in sustained improvements in human health. Intermittent fasting regimens
are hypothesized to influence metabolic regulation via effects on (a) circadian
biology, (b) the gut microbiome, and (c) modifiable lifestyle behaviors, such
as sleep. If proven to be efficacious, these eating regimens offer promising
nonpharmacological approaches to improving health at the population level,
with multiple public health benefits.

INTRODUCTION
There is no shortage of information available to the public regarding various forms of intermittent
fasting and the purported health benefits of such practices; in fact, an October 2016 internet
search using the terms “diet fasting intermittent alternate day” had more than 210,000 hits. In
contrast, there is a shortage of evidence-based support for intermittent fasting that can be used
to generate recommendations for public health practice. Intermittent fasting—that is, periods of
voluntary abstinence from food and drink—is an ancient practice followed in a variety of different
formats by populations globally (12). The popular press includes numerous publications, blogs,
news articles, and diet recommendations related to intermittent fasting and intermittent caloric
restriction. For example, in 2013, Mosley & Spencer (75) published a best-selling book titled “The
FastDiet,” which touts the benefits of restricting energy intake severely for 2 days a week but eating
normally during the rest of the week. A major online retailer lists more than 1,500 items related to
intermittent fasting, including diet books, recipe collections, apps, and food supplements. There
is a high level of interest in intermittent fasting and metabolic health in the scientific community,
as well as among the lay public and media. The number of review articles on the general topic
nearly matches the number of primary human and animal model research studies published during
2014–2016 (3–6, 8, 9, 19–23, 29, 40, 44, 48, 51, 53, 56, 58, 59, 63, 66–68, 72, 76, 84, 91, 92, 103,
104, 108, 116, 121). Together, striking evidence from animal studies and suggestive evidence from
human studies strongly support the need for rigorous clinical investigation of using intermittent
fasting regimens to improve health.
This review provides an overview of intermittent fasting regimens (Table 1), summarizes the
evidence for the health benefits of intermittent fasting, and discusses physiological mechanisms
by which intermittent fasting might lead to improved health outcomes. We focus on human
intervention studies, but also present compelling evidence from rodent models and reviews. The
bulk of scientific evidence for the health benefits of intermittent fasting primarily comes from
studies of male rodent models. Human studies have largely been limited to observational studies
of religious fasting (e.g., during Ramadan), cross-sectional studies of eating patterns associated
with health outcomes, and experimental studies with modest sample sizes. For the purposes of
this review, the health outcomes of interest are changes in weight and in metabolic parameters

Intermittent fasting regimens hypothesized to impact health outcomes
Type of fast
Description
Complete alternate-day fasting
Involves alternating fasting days (no energy-containing foods or beverages consumed) with eating
days (foods and beverages consumed ad libitum)
Modified fasting regimens
Allows consumption of 20–25% of energy needs on scheduled fasting days; the basis for the
popular 5:2 diet, which involves severe energy restriction for 2 nonconsecutive days per week
and ad libitum eating for the other 5 days
Time-restricted feeding
Allows ad libitum energy intake within specific time frames, inducing regular, extended fasting
intervals; studies of <3 meals per day are indirect examinations of a prolonged daily or nightly
fasting period
Religious fasting
Variety of fasting regimens undertaken for religious or spiritual purposes
Ramadan fasting
A fast from sunrise to sunset during the holy month of Ramadan; the most common dietary
practice is to consume one large meal after sunset and one lighter meal before dawn. Thus, the
feast and fast periods of Ramadan are approximately 12 hours in length
Other religious fasts
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints routinely abstain from food and
drink for extended periods of time. Some Seventh-day Adventists consume their last of two daily
meals in the afternoon, resulting in an extended nighttime fasting interval that may be
biologically important
associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. We also present an overview
of the major physiological mechanisms hypothesized to link fasting regimens with human health:
(a) circadian biology, (b) the gut microbiome, and (c) modifiable lifestyle behaviors, such as diet,
activity, and sleep. In conclusion, we present summary points regarding the evidence base for
intermittent fasting as an intervention for improving human health and propose future issues that
should be addressed in rigorously designed clinical trials.
METHODS
We present a brief background of the considerable literature on intermittent fasting in animal
models to provide context for the translational research that has been completed in humans. For
human studies, we focus on findings from interventions that examined alternate-day fasting, mod-
ified fasting regimens, and time-restricted feeding (Table 1). A MEDLINE search was performed
using PubMed and the terms “intermittent fasting,” “fasting,” “time-restricted feeding,” and “food
timing.” In addition, we culled relevant papers from the reference lists of research papers, as well as
reviews of fasting regimens (67, 84, 108). Inclusion criteria for human studies were: (a) randomized
controlled trials and nonrandomized trials, (b) adult male or female participants, and (c) end points
that included changes in body weight or biomarkers of the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
or cancer. This is not a formal review or a meta-analysis: These studies cannot be combined be-
cause they are markedly dissimilar with regards to the interventions, the comparison groups (or
lack thereof), sample composition, study design, and intervention duration. Intermittent fasting
performed as a religious practice (e.g., during Ramadan) is reviewed separately and with less de-
tail because these eating patterns are not motivated by health concerns and have generally been
studied using observational study designs.
HUMAN INTERVENTION STUDIES
We identified 16 intervention trials in the literature (Table 2) that support the efficacy of in-
termittent fasting on human health. Most of the studies enrolled fewer than 50 participants for

relatively short intervention periods, which, unfortunately, limits the statistical power of analyses
of relevant outcomes.
Alternate-Day Fasting
Alternate-day fasting involves alternating fasting days, during which no calories are consumed,
and feeding days, during which foods and beverages are consumed ad libitum. In 2007, Varady &
Hellerstein (111) reviewed alternate-day fasting studies in rodents and concluded that this fasting

regimen was as effective as simple caloric restriction in reducing obesity-associated body weight
and fasting insulin and glucose concentrations. Alternate-day fasting in rodent models of obesity
has also been shown to reduce total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) concentrations,
reduce liver steatosis and inflammatory gene expression, and have beneficial effects on cancer risk
factors, such as cell proliferation (40, 59, 111, 121).
Four intervention studies have explored the metabolic effects of alternate-day fasting
(Table 2) (3, 43, 49, 54). Sample sizes were modest and ranged from 8 to 30 normal weight
adults and 10 overweight or obese adults (3). No information was provided about the physical
activity levels of these participants. Two of three studies reported significant weight loss, although
we question the clinical relevance of weight loss in a 1-day study (54). In the 22-day study of
alternate-day fasting, participants experienced a mean 2.5% weight loss ( p < 0.001) (49). Three
of the studies found a significant decrease in at least one glucoregulatory marker. In contrast, the
study that included overweight and obese participants did not and, in fact, reported a detrimental
effect of 1-day total fasting on postprandial glucose and insulin the following day (3). This same
study and another examined lipid levels with mixed results. The 1-day fasting study observed
improved postprandial TGs the following day. One study observed improvements in high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and fasting TGs, but increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol at the study end point. One of two studies assessing inflammation found significant
improvements in inflammatory biomarkers.
One caveat of this research is that three of these four studies enrolled normal weight adults who
were unlikely to show substantial improvements in metabolic risk factors. Although not a focus of
this review, hunger and mental status, as well as post-fast energy intake, are important outcomes
to consider with extended fasting during waking hours. Appleton & Baker (4) recently reported
that in women (n = 16), a 2-day fast resulted in distraction, but not hunger, and was associated
with lower mood and perceived work performance compared with 2 days prior to and following
the fasting period. Antoni et al. (3) observed that a 1-day fast resulted in a 30% reduction in energy
intake 3 days post-fast. Heilbronn et al. (49) noted that participants reported considerable hunger
on fasting days, which did not decrease over time.
The sparse data on alternate-day fasting suggest that this regimen can result in modest weight
loss and lead to improvements in some metabolic parameters. However, reports of extreme hunger
while fasting indicate that this may not be a feasible public health intervention.
Modified Fasting Regimens
Modified fasting regimens generally specify that energy consumption is limited to 20–25% of
energy needs on regularly scheduled fasting days. In these studies, the term fasting is used to
describe periods of severely limited energy intake rather than no energy intake. This type of
regimen, also called intermittent energy restriction, is the basis for the popular 5:2 diet, which
involves energy restriction for 2 nonconsecutive days per week and unrestricted eating during the
other 5 days of the week (75).
Varady et al. (112) have investigated the impacts of modified alternate-day fasting in mice.
In a trial comparing 85% energy restriction on alternate fasting days to ad libitum chow, the
energy-restricted condition resulted in decreased visceral fat, leptin, and resistin, and increases in
adiponectin. Similar studies conducted by this research group also found that in mice these fasting
regimens appear to reduce adipocyte size, cell proliferation, and levels of insulin-like growth
factor 1 (113–115).
We identified nine trials of modified fasting in humans (Table 2) (10, 28, 45, 46, 51, 57, 109,
110, 117). Study sample sizes ranged from 10 to 107 adults, all of whom were overweight or

obese. The duration of the fasting interventions ranged from 2 to 6 months. Of the nine studies,
only one instituted weekly exercise goals (117). Overall, 7 of 9 studies (78%) reported statistically
significant weight loss, which ranged from 3.2% in comparison with a control group (10) during
a 12-week period to 8.0% in a one-arm trial during an 8-week period (57). Three of six studies
found significant decreases in fasting insulin, and one found reductions in fasting glucose. Three
of eight studies found significant improvements in circulating LDL cholesterol or TGs. Three of
six studies found significant improvements in inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein
(CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), adiponectin, leptin, and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF). Although Hoddy et al. (51) observed significant increases in the area under the
curve of acutely measured postprandial ghrelin response to a meal tolerance test at the end of
the study compared with baseline, participants’ subjective hunger during this meal tolerance test
was unchanged after the intervention. Interestingly, participants’ feelings of fullness and levels
of PYY (peptide tyrosine tyrosine) increased. Thus, although some changes in gut peptide levels
associated with hunger (i.e., increased ghrelin) occur with this modified fasting regimen, there
were net beneficial effects on feelings related to reduced energy intake. Half of these studies
assessed some aspect of mood or other behavioral side effects in response to the fasting regimen
(45, 46, 57, 110). In general, these studies reported that a small proportion (generally <15%) of
participants reported negative side effects, such as feeling cold, irritable, low energy, or hunger.
However, there were mean improvements in mood, including reductions in tension, anger, and
fatigue, and increases in self-confidence and positive mood.
Three of the nine trials summarized above compared modified fasting regimens with simple
energy restriction (45, 46, 117). As shown in Table 2, the weight loss regimens were either 1,200–
1,500 kcal (117) or 25% energy restriction per day (45, 46). One of these studies instituted weekly
exercise goals (117). In only one case did the fasting regimen result in significantly more weight
loss (mean loss 9.6%) than a standard weight-loss diet (mean loss 5.5%) (117). In two of these
studies, there were significantly reduced insulin concentrations compared with energy restriction,
but no other differences in biomarker concentrations. The 12-week, controlled weight-loss trial
found that the modified fasting regimen combined with an exercise protocol produced significantly
superior weight loss results (mean loss 6.5%) compared with fasting alone (mean loss 3.2%) or
exercise alone (mean loss 1.1%) (10).
Reviews and meta-analyses have compared the efficacy of fasting regimens with continuous
energy restriction (6, 44, 48, 91, 107). The authors of these publications unanimously report that,
given the current state of the evidence, the overall metabolic benefits of fasting regimens are not
superior to those of continuous energy restriction. Furthermore, they state that studies of fasting
regimen interventions that are properly powered and controlled, and of sufficient duration, are
lacking and needed.
Results from the limited number of intervention trials of modified fasting regimens suggest
that these eating patterns result in weight loss, with modest and mixed effects on glucoregulatory
markers, lipids, and inflammatory markers.
Time-Restricted Feeding
Two recent publications have reviewed time-restricted feeding in rodent models (67, 84). We
identified 13 studies that had daily fasting intervals ranging from 12 to 21 hours in numerous
rodent models, with variability in coordination with light and dark phases and composition of
chow. Despite the heterogeneity of published rodent studies, overall, time-restricted feeding was
associated with reductions in body weight, total cholesterol, TGs, glucose, insulin, interleukin
6 (IL-6), and TNF-α, as well as with improvements in insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, positive

health outcomes occurred despite the variable effects of intermittent fasting on weight loss. Nearly
all studies of rodent fasting regimens, including time-restricted feeding, have been conducted in
male mice. We have published a study that recapitulates the overall metabolic benefit of time-
restricted feeding as an intervention strategy in an obese, postmenopausal female mouse model
(23). Thus, the time-restricted feeding intervention paradigm seems to be translational to both
men and women.
Time-restricted feeding research in animals highlights the potential importance of synchro-
nizing intermittent fasting regimens with daily circadian rhythms. Rodents fed ad libitum high-fat
diet (HFD) chow eat throughout the night and the day, disrupting their normal nocturnal feeding
cycle. These ad libitum HFD-fed mice become obese and metabolically dysfunctional, and can
develop type 2 diabetes. It was unknown whether HFD-induced metabolic dysfunction resulted
from HFD content, increased net caloric intake, disruption of circadian rhythms, or a combina-
tion of these. Interestingly, mice whose HFD feeding was restricted to 8 hours during the normal
nocturnal eating time consumed equivalent energy, but were protected from obesity, hyperin-
sulinemia, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation compared with ad libitum HFD-fed mice (47).
Time-restricted feeding also is effective as an intervention for diet-induced obesity and associated
metabolic dysfunction (17, 23).
We identified only four trials in humans that investigated the impacts of time-restricted feeding
interventions that prolong the duration of nighttime fasting. Two of these crossover studies found
significant reductions in weight. A study in 29 normal weight men (2 weeks per study condition)
prescribed a nighttime fasting interval of ≥11 hours, which resulted in a significant weight change
difference between the intervention [−0.4 (SD 1.1) kg] and control [+0.6 (SD 0.9) kg] conditions,
equivalent to a 2.1% weight loss (65). No biomarkers were assessed. Another crossover study
reported a 4.1% weight loss effect of consuming a single meal in the afternoon each day for
8 weeks without calorie restriction compared with an isocaloric diet consumed as three meals
per day (15, 99). The one meal per day condition was also associated with reductions in fasting
glucose and improvements in LDL and HDL cholesterol. Although self-reported hunger was
higher in the morning for those consuming one meal per day, this fasting regimen was considered
acceptable because there were no mean changes in measurements of tension, depression, anger,
vigor, fatigue, or confusion.
The long-term metabolic benefits associated with eating or not eating breakfast—that is, ex-
tending the nighttime fast until the lunch meal—are of great research and public interest. Focusing
specifically on the omission of breakfast (equivalent to a ≥13-hour nighttime fast), Chowdhury
and colleagues (21, 22) have conducted both a 1-day crossover trial and a 6-week intervention
trial in obese individuals. The acute morning and post-lunch effects of omitting the breakfast
meal were assessed in the 1-day study. On the day that they did not eat breakfast, participants
were hungrier at lunchtime and had higher plasma levels of acetylated ghrelin compared with
their levels on the breakfast day. Their post-lunch postprandial glucose and insulin levels were
higher on the breakfast-free day, but they did not eat more calories at lunch. They had lower
postprandial PYY, leptin, and acetylated ghrelin levels without a change in appetite later in the
afternoon compared with the breakfast day. Satiety- and appetite-regulating hormones and pep-
tides were affected by prolonged morning fasting, but these alterations did not significantly affect
calorie intake. Interestingly, in their 6-week controlled trial, they observed no benefit with respect
to weight change, glycemic control, lipids, or inflammatory markers for the group omitting the
breakfast meal compared with the control group.
Studies in rodents have demonstrated that restricting the availability of food to the normal
nighttime feeding cycle improves metabolic profiles and reduces the risk of obesity and obesity-
related conditions, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and chronic diseases, such as diabetes

ever, the potential importance of aligning food intake with daytime hours for metabolic health in
humans is also supported by the epidemiological evidence described in the next section.
HUMAN OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES
Religious Fasting
Fasting is an important practice in many religions, for both spiritual and physical benefits. Pub-
lished research on religious practice–based fasting regimens is almost entirely observational.
Therefore, we provide only an overview of these regimens.
Ramadan fasting. It is an important component of Islamic practice for healthy adult Muslims to
fast from sunrise to sunset during the holy month of Ramadan. In addition, fluid intake, cigarette
smoking, and medications are forbidden. Depending on the geographical location of those who
are fasting during Ramadan, day fasting can vary from 11 to 22 hours. Islamic fasting during
Ramadan does not require energy restriction; however, as the intake of food and fluid becomes
less frequent, changes in body weight may occur.
A 2012 meta-analysis of 35 studies examined weight changes during Ramadan. Across these
studies, participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 58 years; just more than half (52%) of studies were
conducted with both males and females, 34% were conducted with only males, and 11% were
conducted with only females (86). The authors of the review found statistically significant weight
loss in 21 (60%) of the studies (86). When pooled, the studies in this meta-analysis showed a
1.24 kg weight reduction [95% confidence interval (CI), −1.60 to −0.88 kg] during the month
of Ramadan fasting. Across 16 follow-up studies, the mean weight regained during the 2 weeks
following Ramadan was 0.72 kg (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.13 kg).
A 2013 meta-analysis of 30 cohort studies that included healthy young men and women exam-
ined whether Ramadan fasting altered biomarkers in addition to weight (62). The primary finding
of this meta-analysis was that after Ramadan fasting, LDL and fasting blood glucose levels were
decreased in both sexes and also in the entire group compared with levels prior to Ramadan (62).
In females, HDL cholesterol levels were significantly increased. In males, there was a significant
decrease in weight, total cholesterol, and TGs. Some studies have reported that Ramadan fasts
are associated with significantly lower concentrations of inflammatory markers, such as CRP,
IL-6, and TNF-α (1, 30). Recent studies have shown that Ramadan fasting practiced by patients
with type 2 diabetes for 15–21 days leads to a statistically and clinically significant reduction in
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of approximately 0.5 points, suggesting that glycemic control is
improved substantially during Ramadan fasting in this population (122). Ramadan is the most com-
mon form of time-restricted feeding, and it results in transitory weight loss, with mixed evidence
for improvements in metabolic markers. However, this feeding pattern is in biological opposi-
tion to human circadian rhythms (see Health-Promoting Mechanisms Associated with Fasting,
Circadian Biology) and, therefore, unlikely to be pursued as a desirable weight-loss intervention.
Other religious fasts. A study of 448 patients from hospitals in Utah found that followers of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who reported routine fasting (29%) exhibited
significantly lower weight and lower fasting glucose levels, as well as lower prevalences of diabetes
[odds ratio (OR), 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.99) and coronary stenosis (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to
0.84) (52). Seventh-day Adventists emphasize a healthy diet and lifestyle as important expressions
of their faith, and they live approximately 7.3 years longer than other white adults. This increase

in life expectancy has been primarily attributed to their healthful lifestyle, including not smoking,
eating a plant-based diet, and exercising regularly (33). Seventh-day Adventists often consume
the last of two daily meals in the afternoon, which results in a prolonged nightly fasting period
that may be physiologically important. Although it is unknown what proportion of Seventh-day
Adventists adhere to a two meals per day pattern, this pattern is typically chronic, and sometimes
lifelong, which would allow sufficient time to achieve stable changes in physiology (99). However,
the relationship between health and reduced meal frequency and prolonged nightly fasting among
Adventists has not been studied (60).
There are considerable observational data on various forms of religious fasting, most of which
suggest that these regimens result in transitory weight loss and mixed impacts on other biomarkers.
Epidemiological Studies
A large and robust literature indicates that shift-work is associated with nighttime eating and
increased risks of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (particularly breast cancer)
(42, 88, 97, 98, 100). Similarly, data from trials and prospective cohort studies support the hypoth-
esis that consuming the majority of the day’s energy earlier in the day, thus prolonging the time
during which little or no food intake occurs in the evening or during nighttime, is associated with
lower weight and improved health (11, 14, 55, 82, 106). Using data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (known as NHANES), we have shown that each 3-hour increase
in nighttime fasting duration was associated with significantly reduced odds of elevated HbA1c
(OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.97) (69) and significantly lower CRP concentrations in women who
ate less than 30% of their daily calories after 5:00 PM ( p = 0.01) (71). We recently published an
analysis of the nightly fasting interval in 2,337 breast cancer survivors in the Women’s Healthy
Eating and Living (known as WHEL) Study (80). Our prospective data analysis indicated that
cancer survivors who fasted <13 hours per night during 7 years of follow up had an increased risk
of recurrence (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.76). To our knowledge, this is the first human study to
demonstrate an association of prolonged nightly fasting with a clinical outcome (70). This analysis
also found that a short nightly fast was associated with significantly higher HbA1c and shorter
sleep duration.
Although results from observational studies are limited, these data generally support the hy-
pothesis that consuming energy earlier in the day and prolonging the nightly fasting interval may
reduce the risk of several common chronic diseases.
HEALTH-PROMOTING MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH FASTING
Figure 1 illustrates the relationships among factors hypothesized to link intermittent fasting and
health outcomes. Briefly, intermittent fasting regimens are hypothesized to influence metabolic
regulation via effects on (a) circadian biology, (b) the gut microbiome, and (c) modifiable lifestyle
behaviors. Negative perturbations of these biological and physiological systems can produce a
hostile metabolic milieu, which predisposes individuals to developing obesity, diabetes, cardiovas-
cular disease, and cancer. For further detail about the molecular mechanisms potentially linking
fasting with health outcomes, there are two recent comprehensive reviews (66, 67).
Circadian Biology
Organisms have evolved to restrict their activity to the night or day by developing an endogenous
circadian clock to ensure that physiological processes are performed at the optimal times (77). The

time of day plays a major part in integrating metabolism and energetics, as well as physiological
indices, such as hormonal secretion patterns, physical coordination, and sleep (Figure 2) (35). In
mammals, the master biological clock is in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is
entrained to light and dark stimuli. Similar clock oscillators have been found in peripheral tissues,
such as the liver, with feeding as the dominant timing cue (i.e., zeitgeber).
Circadian rhythms occur across 24-hour light–dark clock cycles and include changes in biology
and behavior. Desynchronization of the suprachiasmatic nucleus master clock in the brain and
peripheral circadian clocks in liver, fat, and skeletal muscle cells may increase the risk of chronic
diseases (89). Feeding signals appear to be the dominant timing cue for the rhythms of peripheral
clocks, including those that control metabolic pathways. Thus, consuming energy outside the
normal feeding phase (i.e., late-night eating in humans) may reset some peripheral clocks and
disrupt energy balance (18). The evidence that nutrient signals and meal timing are circadian
synchronizers is based largely on animal research (26, 93). However, there is a large and robust
literature in humans indicating that shift-work disrupts circadian rhythms and, as mentioned above,
is associated with increased risks of cardiometabolic disease and cancer (42, 88, 97, 98, 100).
Circadian rhythms have an impact on metabolism across the day in humans, and these effects
are malleable by behavioral intervention. Insulin sensitivity decreases throughout the day and into
the night (37). This is, in part, due to the circadian rhythm of insulin secretion and the insulin-
impeding action of growth hormone, the pulsatile concentrations of which increase at night.
Postprandial insulin and glucose responses to meals increase across the day and into the night (32,
38, 74, 81, 85). Thus, meals consumed at night are associated with greater postprandial glucose
and insulin exposure than content-matched meals consumed during the day, leading to increased
HbA1c levels and risk of type 2 diabetes over time. Short-term intervention studies designed
to perturb circadian rhythms in human participants have metabolic consequences. For example,
inducing circadian misalignment in humans by extending the day from a 24-hour to a 28-hour

reduce energy intake in the evening and exclude energy intake during the nighttime synchronize
food ingestion with the times of optimal postprandial hormonal response. As circadian rhythm
synchronizers, it is hypothesized that fasting and time-restricted feeding regimens that actively
impose a diurnal rhythm of food intake aligned with the 24-hour light–dark cycle lead to improved

oscillations in circadian clock gene expression, the reprogramming of molecular mechanisms of
energy metabolism, and improved body weight regulation (47). Interested readers are encouraged
to read more about these molecular outcomes in detailed reviews on the mechanisms underlying
circadian biology (18, 26, 35, 77, 89, 93).
Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the timing of food intake is an important
determinant of human health and disease risk.
Gastrointestinal (Gut) Microbiota
Many functions of the gastrointestinal tract exhibit robust circadian, or sleep–wake, rhythms.
For example, gastric emptying and blood flow are greater during the daytime than at night and,
as described above, metabolic responses to a glucose load are slower in the evening than in the
morning (87). Therefore, it is plausible that a chronically disturbed circadian profile may affect
gastrointestinal function and impair metabolism and health (27). The gut microbiome impacts
metabolic health; its diversity is regulated by diet; and it has a circadian rhythm that is entrained
by food signals (83, 102, 105, 119). Rodent studies show that the gut microbiome is highly dy-
namic, exhibiting daily cyclical fluctuations in compositional diversity. Intermittent fasting may
directly influence the gut microbiota, which is the complex, diverse, and vast microbial community
that resides in the intestinal tract. Studies suggest that changes in the composition and metabolic
function of the gut microbiota in obese individuals may enable an obese microbiota to harvest
more energy from the diet than a lean microbiota and, thereby, influence net energy absorption,
expenditure, and storage (83, 102, 105). Diet-induced obesity dampens cyclical microbiota fluc-
tuations. Time-restricted feeding in mice, in which food is available only during the nocturnal
active phase, partially restores these cyclical fluctuations (123). Thus, cyclical changes in the gut
microbiome resulting from diurnal feeding and fasting rhythms contribute to the diversity of gut
microflora and represent a mechanism by which the gut microbiome affects host metabolism. An
extended fasting period (i.e., gut rest) could also lead to reduced gut permeability and, as a result,
to blunted postprandial endotoxemia (50, 61, 64, 73) and to blunted systemic inflammation (94,
102), which are typically elevated in obesity. Recently, investigators from the Salk Institute for
Biological Studies reported that a brain–gut pathway activated in the brain during fasting acts to
promote energy balance by enhancing gut epithelial integrity (95). Finally, jet-lag-induced dys-
biosis in both mice and humans promotes glucose intolerance and obesity that are transferrable
to germ-free mice upon fecal transplantation (101).
Fasting regimens appear to have positive impacts on the gut microbiota. Future studies char-
acterizing the health impacts of fasting regimens on the human microbiota have the potential to
make important contributions to the field.
Modifiable Lifestyle Behaviors
Fasting regimens have the potential to impact modifiable health behaviors. A study in 8 overweight
young adults found that increasing the nightly fasting duration to ≥14 hours resulted in statistically
significant decreases in energy intake and weight, as well as improvements in self-reported sleep
satisfaction, satiety at bedtime, and energy levels (39).
Energy intake. Metabolic unit studies of alternate-day and modified alternate-day fasting have
documented decreased energy consumption. As mentioned above (Human Intervention Studies,
Alternate-Day Fasting), even a 1-day fast or 75% calorie restriction was shown to reduce caloric
intake by approximately 30% during the subsequent 3 days (3). The Chowdhury et al. study (22)

of skipping breakfast showed no increase in food intake at lunch after the prolonged morning
fast and showed no increase in post-lunch appetite. Casazza et al. (16) conducted a systematic
review of obesity-related beliefs about weight loss, therein stating that evidence was lacking
to support the notion that skipping breakfast independently affected obesity. Several of these
authors conducted a randomized controlled weight-loss trial comparing breakfast-skipping,
breakfast-eating, and control groups, finding that weight loss was not different among the groups
(25). However, the influence of fasting in this study is unclear because the length of fasting
across the night and into the morning was not recorded; the minimum difference in the length
of morning fasting permissible in the intervention groups was only 1 hour; and the cessation of
eating at night was not controlled. Studies of fasting regimens in free-living adults depend on
self-reported energy intake, which correlates poorly with objective markers of energy intake (34)
and confound associated analyses. Weight change offers an indirect assessment of the impact of
intermittent fasting on energy intake and, as shown in Table 2, statistically significant weight
reduction was observed in 73% of trials of intermittent fasting. Most fasting regimens reduce
the total number of hours available for eating and, thereby, may reduce overall energy intake
and risk of obesity. The timing of food intake with respect to the 24-hour light–dark cycle likely
has an important influence on food intake, as well as on energy efficiency and weight control.
Research in shift- and night-workers, who eat most of their daily calories at night and who
have an increased risk for obesity, has demonstrated alterations in appetite-regulating hormones
(leptin, ghrelin, xenin) that may lead to increases in total energy intake (24, 90, 118).
Energy expenditure. Animal studies indicate that the circadian clock regulates locomotion. Mice
on a time-restricted, isocaloric feeding regimen have shown improved muscle coordination to-
ward the end of the feeding period (47). Rodent studies demonstrate that time-restricted feeding
regimens increase locomotion (23, 47) and improve circadian activity rhythms (47), an indicator
of overall rhythmicity. However, data in humans are sparse about whether intermittent fasting
regimens impact energy expenditure among free-living adults. Hoddy et al. (51) did not observe
changes in physical activity—assessed by actigraphy at baseline and postintervention—during their
alternate-day fasting study. Chowdhury et al. (21) did not observe differences in 24-hour physi-
cal activity in the intervention group that omitted the breakfast meal compared with the control
group.
Sleep. Numerous observational studies have reported that nighttime eating is associated with
reduced sleep duration and poor sleep quality (2, 120), which can lead to insulin resistance and
increased risks of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (13, 31, 36, 41, 78, 96).
Specifically, eating meals at abnormal circadian times (i.e., late at night) is hypothesized to lead to
circadian desynchronization (7) and subsequent disruption of normal sleep patterns. Chowdhury
et al. (21) found no effect of regularly skipping the breakfast meal (i.e., prolonging the nighttime
fast) on waking time, sleep time, or sleep duration compared with controls. To our knowledge,
no other studies have directly examined associations between intermittent fasting and sleep in
free-living adults.
The potential effects of prolonged nightly fasting on energy intake, sleep, physical activity,
and circadian activity rhythm may act in concert to reduce the risks of cardiometabolic disease
and cancer.
CONCLUSIONS
Even a single fasting interval in humans (e.g., overnight) can reduce basal concentrations of
many metabolic biomarkers associated with chronic disease, such as insulin and glucose. For

example, patients are required to fast for 8–12 hours before blood draws to achieve steady-state
fasting levels for many metabolic substrates and hormones. An important clinical and scientific
question is whether adopting a regular, intermittent fasting regimen is a feasible and sustainable
population-based strategy for promoting metabolic health. Further, properly powered, controlled
clinical research is needed to test whether intermittent fasting regimens can complement or replace
energy restriction and, if so, whether they can facilitate long-term metabolic improvements and
body weight management. The Summary Points are supported by the current evidence.
Additionally, intermittent fasting regimens attempt to translate the positive effects of fasting
regimens in rodents and other mammals into practical eating patterns for reducing the risk of
chronic disease in humans. In the Future Issues section, we suggest issues that should be addressed
in research investigating intermittent fasting and metabolic health.
This overview suggests that intermittent fasting regimens may be a promising approach to
losing weight and improving metabolic health for people who can safely tolerate intervals of not
eating, or eating very little, for certain hours of the day, night, or days of the week. If proven
to be efficacious, these eating regimens may offer promising nonpharmacological approaches to
improving health at the population level with multiple public health benefits.
SUMMARY POINTS
1. Studies in rodents and other nocturnal mammals support the hypothesis that intermittent
fasting and restricting the availability of food to the normal nighttime feeding cycle
improve metabolic profiles and reduce the risks of obesity and obesity-related conditions,
such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cancer.
However, data from related human studies are limited regarding the positive impacts of
time-restricted feeding (i.e., eating patterns aligned with normal circadian rhythms) on
weight or metabolic health.
2. Overall, evidence suggests that intermittent fasting regimens are not harmful physically
or mentally (i.e., in terms of mood) in healthy, normal weight, overweight, or obese
adults.
3. It appears that almost any intermittent fasting regimen can result in some weight loss.
Among the 16 intervention trials included in this review, 11 reported statistically signif-
icant weight loss.
4. Alternate-day fasting appeared to result in weight loss, as well as reductions in glucose
and insulin concentrations, in the three studies evaluating this regimen. However, this
fasting regimen may not be practical because it leads to intense hunger on fasting days.
Modified alternate-day fasting regimens result in reduced weight, with reductions rang-
ing from 3.2%, in comparison with a control group (10) during a 12-week period, to
8.0%, in a one-arm trial during an 8-week period (57). There was limited and mixed
evidence for reductions in insulin concentrations, improvements in lipids, or reductions
in inflammatory factors.
5. Research has not demonstrated that alternate-day fasting regimens produce superior
weight loss in comparison to standard, continuous calorie restriction weight-loss plans.
6. There are considerable observational data on various forms of religious fasting, most of
which suggest that these regimens result in transitory weight loss and have mixed impacts
on other biomarkers.

7. Data are lacking regarding the impacts of intermittent fasting on other health behaviors,
such as diet, sleep, and physical activity.
8. There are limited data linking intermittent fasting regimens with clinical outcomes, such
as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s
disease.
FUTURE ISSUES
1. Modified fasting regimens appear to promote weight loss and may improve metabolic
health. However, there are insufficient data to determine the optimal fasting regimen,
including the length of the fasting interval, the number of fasting days per week, the
degree of energy restriction needed on fasting days, and recommendations for dietary
behavior on nonfasting days.
2. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that eating patterns that reduce or elim-
inate nighttime eating and prolong nightly fasting intervals may result in sustained im-
provements in human health. Although this hypothesis has not been tested in humans,
support from animal research is striking, and data from human time-restricted feeding
studies are suggestive. Prolonged nightly fasting (i.e., restricting food intake primarily
to daylight hours) may be a simple, feasible, and potentially effective disease prevention
strategy at the population level.
3. Large-scale randomized trials of intermittent fasting regimens in free-living adults are
needed and should last for at least a year to properly assess whether behavioral and
metabolic changes are sustainable and whether they have long-term effects on biomark-
ers of aging and longevity. Future studies should incorporate objective measures of energy
intake, sleep, and energy expenditure; assess numerous markers of disease risk; and en-
roll diverse populations who disproportionately suffer from obesity and related health
maladies.
4. Recommendations for weight loss frequently include advice to eat regular meals to avoid
hunger. Some guidelines also advise the consumption of snacks throughout the day.
However, current evidence suggests that periods of fasting do not necessarily lead to
overeating.
