Abstract
Background—Social media (SM) use is increasing among U.S. young adults, and its association 
with mental well-being remains unclear. This study assessed the association between SM use and 
depression in a nationally-representative sample of young adults.
Methods—We surveyed 1,787 adults ages 19 to 32 about SM use and depression. Participants 
were recruited via random digit dialing and address-based sampling. SM use was assessed by self-
reported total time per day spent on SM, visits per week, and a global frequency score based on 
the Pew Internet Research Questionnaire. Depression was assessed using the Patient-Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression Scale Short Form. Chi-
squared tests and ordered logistic regressions were performed with sample weights.
Results—The weighted sample was 50.3% female and 57.5% White. Compared to those in the 
lowest quartile of total time per day spent on SM, participants in the highest quartile had 
significantly increased odds of depression (AOR=1.66, 95% CI=1.14–2.42) after controlling for all 
covariates. Compared with those in the lowest quartile, individuals in the highest quartiles of SM 
site visits per week and those with a higher global frequency score had significantly increased 
odds of depression (AOR=2.74, 95% CI=1.86–4.04; AOR=3.05, 95% CI=2.03–4.59, respectively). 
All associations between independent variables and depression had strong, linear, dose-response 
trends. Results were robust to all sensitivity analyses.

INTRODUCTION
Depression is highly prevalent in the U.S., and the incidence is increasing.[1,2] It accounts 
for more disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) than all other mental disorders,[3] and it is 
projected to become the leading cause of disability in high-income countries by 2030.[4] The 
economic burden of depression is estimated at 83 billion dollars annually from reduced 
worker productivity, increased medical expenses, and suicide.[5] Recurrence is frequent, and 
comorbidity with other psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and substance use disorder is 
common.[1,6]
Depression often begins around young adulthood.[7,8] While multiple factors contribute to 
depression,[9] there is growing interest in the potential influence of social media (SM) use on 
psychological well-being. SM, which can be defined as “a group of Internet-based 
applications that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content,”[10] has become 
an integral component of connecting with friends and family, sharing personal content, and 
obtaining news and entertainment.[11,12] Use of SM sites such as Facebook and Twitter has 
particularly increased among young adults, who are at critical junctures surrounding 
developmental tasks such as identity development and establishment of social norms.[13] As 
many as 90% of young adults in the U.S. use social media, and the majority of users visit 
these sites at least once a day.[14] SM use accounts for about 20% of time online on personal 
computers and 30% of time online via mobile phones.[15]
Published studies on the association between social media use and depression have yielded 
mixed results.[16,17] Some studies suggest that SM users may experience decreased 
depression,[18] possibly from an increase in social capital, perceived social support, and life 
satisfaction.[19,20] Other studies, however, indicate that frequent use of social media may be 
associated with declines in subjective well-being, life satisfaction, and real-life 
community.[17,21] All of these prior studies, however, have been limited by small and/or 
localized samples. Furthermore, they have tended to focus on one specific platform, 
Facebook,[16,21] while real-life usage, especially among young adults, tends to incorporate a 
diverse array of social media sites such as Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat, 
and Vine.[14,15] In this study, we aimed to examine a broader range of SM exposures and to 
determine the association between SM exposure and depression in a large, nationally-
representative sample of young adults. Understanding the relationship between SM use and 
depression could allow the development of interventions or preventative strategies for at-risk 
populations.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design, Participants, and Setting
We surveyed a nationally-representative sample of U.S. young adults aged 19 to 32 
regarding their depression and social media use. We drew our sample from a large-scale 
web-based research panel developed and maintained by a survey research company called 
Growth from Knowledge (GfK).[22] Participants were recruited via random digit dialing and 
address-based sampling, reaching a sampling frame of over 97% of the U.S. population.[22] 
GfK is continuously recruiting individuals to be a part of their survey panel. Individuals are 
also free to withdraw from the panel at any point. The GfK Knowledge Panel® model has 
been shown to be a statistically valid method for surveying and analyzing health indicators 
from a nationally representative sample.[23,24]
From October 2014 to November 2014, our web-based survey was sent via email to a 
random sample of 3,048 non-institutionalized adults between the ages of 19 to 32 who had 
consented to participate in a previous study wave. Participation for this initial wave was 
54%, a strong response rate for the use of Internet panels in the recruitment of study 
subjects.[25,26] The current data were collected during the 18-month follow-up of this study, 
which assessed multiple health behaviors among individuals ages 18 to 30 at baseline. We 
used only the 18-month follow-up data for the current analysis because the social media 
items were not asked at baseline. Thus, although the overall survey was part of a 
longitudinal study, the data specific to social media use and depression were only asked at 
one time point. Responses were received from 1,787 participants (59%).
The survey research company (GfK) instituted multiple strategies to improve data quality. 
For example, they screened all data sets for patterns suggestive of lack of effort. GfK also 
instituted procedures such as minimizing survey length whenever possible, reducing the 
need for scrolling, and avoiding the use of long grids. Furthermore, if individuals did not 
answer a question they were prompted once to answer with the statement “your answer is 
important to us. Please put your best guess.”
The median time for survey completion was 15 minutes and participants received $15 for 
their participation. This study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional 
Review Board and was granted a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes 
of Health.
Measures
Participants completed online survey items including depression (dependent variable), social 
media use (independent variable), and covariates.
Depression—We assessed depression using a 4-item scale developed by the Patient-
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). PROMIS is a National 
Institutes of Health Roadmap initiative whose aim is to provide precise, valid, reliable, and 
standardized questionnaires measuring patient–reported outcomes across the domains of 
physical, mental, and social health.[27] The PROMIS depression scale was developed using 
item response theory to promote greater precision and decrease respondent burden.[28]

 Specifically, the PROMIS depression scale has been correlated and validated with other 
commonly used depression instruments, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies 
Depression Scale (CES-D), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9).[29,30] The 4-item PROMIS depression scale asked participants how 
frequently in the past 7 days they had experienced depression, including feeling hopeless, 
worthless, helpless, or depressed.[31] These items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale 
ranging from 1 to 5, corresponding to responses of “Never,” “Rarely,” “Sometimes,” 
“Often” and “Always.” Thus, the total possible raw score was between 4 and 20. Based upon 
the non-normal distribution of data, the raw scores were collapsed into tertiles of “low,” 
“medium” and “high” for primary analysis. This was appropriate because one of the specific 
aims of the PROMIS depression scale is to grade the severity of depression, instead of 
merely providing a dichotomous cut-off for clinical depression. We classified those who did 
not endorse any depression as those in the “low” group (raw score = 4), which represented 
44.5% of the population. We then classified a “high” group based on both the distribution of 
the data and the clinical cut-off for depression recommended by the American Psychiatry 
Association (APA).[32] This cut-off corresponded to a raw score of 9 or more (out of 20), 
which corresponds to a T-score of 57.3. Because the APA uses 55 as a cutoff for diagnosing 
clinical depression, individuals in the “high” group have a high likelihood of experiencing 
some depression.[32] This group represented 26.3% of the population. Those with raw scores 
between 5 and 8 were classified as “medium” and comprised 29.2% of the population.
Social Media Use—We assessed participants’ social media use in three complementary 
ways. First, participants were asked to estimate total time per day on social media for 
personal use. This item specifically instructed participants to not count any time spent on 
social media for work. Participants provided estimates in numerical fields for hours and 
minutes on an average day. Second, participants were asked to report their use of each of 11 
widely used social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, 
LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat, and Reddit.[14,15] Seven response 
choices ranged from “I do not use this platform” to “I use this platform 5 or more times a 
day.” We based these items on the measures used by Pew Internet Research.[14] Using 
weighted averages based on the frequency responses, we computed social media site visits 
per week. Finally, we summed responses across platforms to obtain a total score without 
weighting values for frequency. Because there were 7 response choices for each item, which 
we coded as 0 to 6, the resulting global frequency score ranged from 0 to 66. In order to 
improve interpretability of results, we collapsed all independent variables into quartiles for 
primary analyses. To ensure robustness of results, we also conducted all analyses with 
independent variables as continuous.
Covariates—For analysis, we divided the sample into three age groups (19–23; 24–26; 27–
32) and race/ethnicity into five mutually exclusive groups (White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-
Hispanic; Hispanic; Bi-racial, multiracial; or Other non-Hispanic). We also assessed other 
environmental and personal factors that may affect depression and social media use.[1,14] 
These included relationship status (single or in a committed relationship), living situation 
(with a parent or guardian; with a significant other; or other situation), household income

 (under $30,000; $30,000–$74,999; or $75,000 or more) and education level (high school or 
less; some college; or bachelor’s degree or higher).
Data Analysis
We included all participants who had complete data on the PROMIS depression scale and 
the social media items. Because only ~1% of participants had missing data for these 
variables, this did not affect our results. To describe our sample, we computed percentages 
of the dependent variable, each of the three independent variables, and the seven covariates. 
Next, we used chi-square tests to determine bivariable associations between each of the 
independent variables and covariates and the PROMIS depression scale score. After 
confirming that the proportional odds assumption was met, we used ordered logistic 
regression with appropriate sample weights to examine bivariable and multivariable 
associations between each social media variable and depression. We decided a priori to 
include all covariates in our primary multivariable models. We also used regression analyses 
to examine whether there was an overall linear trend between each ordered categorical 
independent variable and the dependent variable. In order to take advantage of the 
nationally-representative nature of the data, all primary analyses were conducted using 
survey weights which took into account sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, household 
income, census region, metropolitan area, and internet access.
We also conducted four sets of sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our results. 
First, we conducted all analyses with the outcome variable as dichotomous instead of in 
tertiles. For these analyses, those above the APA cut-off for the PROMIS depression scale 
were compared with all others.[32] Second, we conducted all analyses with independent 
variables as continuous instead of ordered categorical variables. Third, we conducted all 
analyses using only covariates that had a bivariable association of P < .15 with the outcome. 
Fourth, we conducted all analyses without survey weights. Results from all sensitivity 
analyses showed similar levels of significance and magnitude to those described here.
Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 12.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas), and 
two-tailed P-values < .05 were considered to be significant.
RESULTS
Participants
A total of 1,787 participants completed the questionnaire. The weighted sample was 50.3% 
female, 57.5% White, 13.0% African American, 20.6% Hispanic and 8.9% biracial/
multiracial or other. Of these, slightly more than half (55.6%) were in a committed 
relationship and approximately a third (35.7%) reported living with a significant other. In 
terms of household income, 22.9% were in the “low” category (under $30,000) and 38.7% 
were in the “high” category ($75,000 and above). About one-third (36.0%) of participants 
had not attended any college, while a quarter (25.8%) had a B.A. or higher (Table 1). There 
were no differences between responders and non-responders in terms of age (p = .12), sex (p 
= .07), or race (p = .21).

 Depression
Accounting for survey weights, 44.5% of the sample reported no indicators of depression in 
the past week and were placed in the “low” group. About one-fourth (26.3%) were classified 
as “high,” and the remaining 29.2% of participants were in the “medium” group.
Social Media Use
Median total time on social media was 61 minutes per day (interquartile range [IQR] = 30–
135). Median social media site visits per week across all platforms was 30 (IQR = 9–57) and 
median global frequency score was 11 (IQR = 6–17). Only 58 individuals (3.2%) reported 0 
site visits per week.
Bivariable Analyses
Bivariable analyses showed significant associations between all social media use variables, 
depression, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education level (Table 1). A greater percentage of 
participants aged 27–32 were in the “high” depression category (38.7%) as compared to 
participants aged 19–23 (28.8%) and 24–26 (32.5%). Female sex and lower education level 
were also both associated with being in the “high” depression group. Additionally, bivariable 
analyses demonstrated significant associations between total time per day on social media 
and age, sex, and education level (Table 2). Younger age, female sex, and lower education 
level were all associated with greater time per day on social media. Age was the only 
covariate significantly associated with social media site visits per week (P < .001), with 
younger age associated with being in the highest category of site visits per week. Age, living 
situation, and household income were all significantly associated with the global frequency 
score (P from < .001 to .03), with younger age, not living with a significant other, and being 
in the highest tertile of household income associated with a greater global frequency score 
(data not shown).
Multivariable Analyses
In fully adjusted models, participants in the highest quartile of total time per day on social 
media had significantly greater odds of having depression (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.14 – 
2.42) compared to those in the lowest quartile (Figure). Compared to those in the lowest 
quartile, participants in the highest quartiles of social media site visits per week (AOR = 
2.74, 95% CI = 1.86 – 4.04) and global frequency score (AOR = 3.05, 95% CI = 2.03 – 4.59) 
reported greater depression. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that all associations between 
independent variables and depression had strong, linear, dose-response trends (P = .002 for 
total time per day and P < .001 for both visits per week and global frequency score).
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates a strong and significant association between social media use and 
depression in a nationally-representative sample of U.S. young adults. There was a linear 
association between social media use and depression for all three social media use variables. 
While some prior studies have found no association or mixed results,[16,33] our findings are 
consistent with prior research that showed an association between social media use and 
mood dysregulation.[17,34]

 Our findings regarding prevalence of depression were generally consistent with prior 
research. In particular, Christakis et al. found that 56% of college-aged adults reported no 
depression according to the PHQ-9,[35] which has been validated against the PROMIS 
depression measure.[36] Our findings regarding the linear association between social media 
use and depression were somewhat surprising given prior research that has shown increased 
depression in those with low internet use.[33] However, one reason for our finding may be 
that our sample had so few individuals who did not use social media (only 3.2% of the 
sample). It is notable that our results showed a consistent linear trend between the 
independent and dependent variables even when the independent variable was 
operationalized as continuous.
Because our data were cross-sectional, the directionality of this association is not clear. It 
may be that individuals with depression tend to use more social media. For example, 
depressed individuals with a diminished sense of self-worth may turn to social media based 
interactions for validation.[37,38] Subsequently, individuals may suffer from continuous 
rumination and guilt surrounding internet use, while feeling compelled to continue the cycle 
due to low self-efficacy and negative self-appraisal.[37,39] Due to the high accessibility of 
social media and the possibility of socialization in a controlled setting, individuals with 
underlying depression and anhedonia may be more drawn to social media interactions rather 
than face-to-face interactions.[40,41]
It may also be that those who use increased amounts of social media subsequently develop 
increased depression. Multiple studies have linked social media use with declines in 
subjective mood, sense of well-being, and life satisfaction.[17,21,34] For example, passive 
consumption of social media content—as opposed to active communication—has been 
associated with decrease in bonding and bridging social capital and increase in 
loneliness.[42] One explanation may be that exposure to highly idealized representations of 
peers on social media elicits feelings of envy and the distorted belief that others lead happier 
and/or more successful lives.[43,44] Consequently, these envious feelings may lead to a sense 
of self-inferiority and depression over time.[45] It is also possible that the feeling of “time 
wasted” by engaging in activities of little meaning on social media negatively influences 
mood.[34] Additionally, the substantial rise in the amount of time young individuals spend on 
the Internet—particularly on social media—has led some to call for the recognition of 
“Internet addiction” as a distinct psychiatric condition that is closely associated with 
depression.[46,47] Finally, it is possible that increased social media exposure may increase 
the risk of cyber-bullying, which may also increase feelings of depression.[48,49]
Regardless of the direction of association between social media use and depression, these 
findings should be of interest to clinicians and public health practitioners. For example, it 
may be valuable for clinicians to assess social media use among depressed individuals to 
probe for maladaptive patterns of use, which may be contributing to mood dysregulation. 
Additionally, there may be useful ways of leveraging social media to decrease stigma of 
depression and identify individuals at risk, such as detecting self-disclosures of depression 
on social media.[50] Because social media has become an integrated component of human 
interaction, it is important for clinicians interacting with young adults to recognize the 
important balance to be struck in encouraging potential positive use but redirecting from

 problematic use. With regard to public health practitioners, these findings suggest that social 
media may provide valuable venues to screen for depression or to disseminate targeted 
educational messages regarding depression. Such messages could promote awareness 
regarding maladaptive use and its association with mood disorders.
The teams behind some social media sites have already begun to reach out to users who 
show signs of serious depression. When one searches blog site Tumblr for tags indicative of 
a mental health crisis such as “depressed,” “suicidal,” or “hopeless,” the search function 
redirects to a message which begins with “Everything okay?” and provides links to pertinent 
resources.[51] Similarly, in early 2015, Facebook tested a feature by which users’ friends 
could easily and anonymously report worrisome posts.[52] Authors of problematic content 
received pop-up messages on their next visit to the site voicing concern and encouraging 
them to speak with a friend or helpline worker. Although this button has since been 
removed, Facebook still accepts reports of suicidal content via an online form. Continued 
research into the factors that relate SM and depression will allow sites to refine their 
procedures and reach out to those with greatest need.
It is important to note that there are many different types of interactions that can occur over 
social media, and our study assessed only overall time spent and frequency of visits to social 
media sites. Moreover, because previous work in this area has tended to focus on one 
specific platform, most commonly Facebook, we aimed to look at the relationship between 
total social media use and depression,[16,21] as opposed to focusing on specific platforms. 
Our fine-grained assessment of multiple platforms likely improved our measurement of 
overall frequency of social media use. However, given the unique features of each platform, 
it may be valuable for future work to assess associations between specific social media sites 
and depression.
Furthermore, it will be an important task of future qualitative and quantitative research to 
comprehensively assess content and contextual elements related to social media use. For 
example, time on social media may be primarily spent viewing profiles, or it may be spent as 
an active participant, and these distinct patterns of use may have differential associations 
with mood conditions. Thus, it may be that those who are more active users feel more 
engaged and derive more sense of social capital from social media interactions.[19,53] 
However, it may also be that active users are more prone to having negative exposures, 
which can affect self-cognitions. Therefore, active vs. passive character of social media 
interaction and its effect on mood may be valuable to assess in the future.
Additionally, it will be important to assess the overall emotional valence of social media 
interactions. Some individuals may primarily spend time “liking” others’ posts, wishing 
friends happy birthday, and making positive comments. Others, however, may be prone to 
posting negative status updates or engaging in contentious interactions, which may be 
detrimental to relationship-building and lead to depression.[54]
Limitations
Given the rapid proliferation of social media platforms, we attempted to capture broad and 
representative use of social media by young adults by including multiple social media

 platforms and creating three complementary methods of assessing social media use based on 
self-report. However, it was a limitation of our work that we were unable to use “gold 
standard” measures of social media exposure such as ecological momentary assessment or 
empirical data from social media sites due to the large sample size. Additionally, our 
frequency measure, although it was adapted from a validated scale,[14] may not have been 
sufficient for modern users. In particular, the highest exposure level we assessed for each 
platform was “5 or more times per day,” while other scales include options such as use 
“several times an hour” and “all the time.”[55] It may be valuable for future studies to use 
more fine-grained measures such as these. It is also a limitation that we were unable to 
conduct a complete diagnostic interview to determine if participants met clinical diagnosis 
of depression. Further longitudinal studies involving ecological momentary assessment or 
empirical data from multiple social media platforms may help identify the directionality of 
the association between social media and depression and guide anticipatory guidance around 
social media use for patients with depression in particular.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this study assessed depression and social media use across multiple social 
media platforms in a large, nationally representative sample of young adults. Given the 
increasing prevalence of social media and the substantial morbidity and mortality associated 
with depression worldwide, the positive association we found between social media use and 
depression has important implications for future research and intervention. For example, 
longitudinal evaluation and finer-grained assessment of content and contextual factors will 
ultimately improve our understanding of these associations and our ability to intervene. 
Additionally, social media platforms may be a useful tool to identify individuals at risk for 
depression and to provide intervention.

 Figure. Multivariable Associations between Depression and Social Media Use Variables
Each social media use variable is divided into quartiles from lowest (Q1) to highest (Q4). 
Vertical bars represent 95% confidence interval and point estimates of adjusted odds ratio. P 
value for overall linear effect was .002, <.001 and <.001 respectively for each social media 
use variable. The multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, race, relationship status, living 
situation, household income, and education level.
