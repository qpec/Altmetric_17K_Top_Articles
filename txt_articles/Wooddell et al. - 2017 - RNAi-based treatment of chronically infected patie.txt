Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health concern worldwide, frequently leading to liver cirrhosis,
liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Evidence suggests that high viral antigen load may play a role in
chronicity. Production of viral proteins is thought to depend on transcription of viral covalently closed circular
DNA (cccDNA). In a human clinical trial with an RNA interference (RNAi)–based therapeutic targeting HBV tran-
scripts, ARC-520, HBV S antigen (HBsAg) was strongly reduced in treatment-naïve patients positive for HBV e
antigen (HBeAg) but was reduced significantly less in patients who were HBeAg-negative or had received long-
term therapy with nucleos(t)ide viral replication inhibitors (NUCs). HBeAg positivity is associated with greater disease
risk that may be moderately reduced upon HBeAg loss. The molecular basis for this unexpected differential response
was investigated in chimpanzees chronically infected with HBV. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that HBsAg
was expressed not only from the episomal cccDNA minichromosome but also from transcripts arising from HBV
DNA integrated into the host genome, which was the dominant source in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees. Many
of the integrants detected in chimpanzees lacked target sites for the small interfering RNAs in ARC-520, explaining
the reduced response in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees and, by extension, in HBeAg-negative patients. Our results
uncover a heretofore underrecognized source of HBsAg that may represent a strategy adopted by HBV to main-
tain chronicity in the presence of host immunosurveillance. These results could alter trial design and endpoint
expectations of new therapies for chronic HBV.
INTRODUCTION
Globally, an estimated 250 million to 400 million people are chronically
infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and about 1 million die each year
from HBV-related liver disease (1, 2). HBV is transmitted parenterally
and infects hepatocytes. The immune system mounts an effective im-
mune response that controls the virus in 95% of patients infected as
adults. In contrast, infected neonates and young children usually be-
come chronically HBV infected (CHB) after exposure. When untreated,
40% of men and 15% of women infected early in life later die of cirrhosis
or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or require liver transplantation (3).
The HBV virion contains a compact 3.2-kb genome that exists as a
partially double-stranded, relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) with a 7- to 9-
baseterminalredundancythatisconvertedintocovalentlyclosedcircular
DNA (cccDNA) within the nucleus of the hepatocyte, functioning as a
minichromosome for HBV transcription (4). Host RNA polymerase II
transcribes HBV genes on the cccDNA to produce five viral RNAs: tran-
scriptsthatencodeprecore[serologicallycalledHBVeantigen(HBeAg)],
the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) that encodes the structural capsid pro-
tein (core) and polymerase and is reverse-transcribed to produce
rcDNA, the pre-S1 transcript that encodes the large S surface protein,
another transcript that encodes pre-S2 and S surface proteins (middle
and small S), and the X gene mRNA. The three surface proteins collect-
ively comprise HBsAg. All HBV transcripts are encoded in overlapping
reading frames, have a common 3′ end, and use the same polyadenyl-
ation signal (PAS). HBsAg, in a lipid bilayer, forms an envelope around
each core-encapsidated, partially double-stranded HBV genome.
Although cccDNA is considered the driver of HBV transcription
and replication, HBV DNA may integrate into the host genome, which
has been associated with the development of HCC, may disrupt host
genes or change their transcription levels, and may result in oncogenic
fusion proteins (5, 6). Integrated HBV genomes are found in non-HCC
livertissueofpatientsas wellasintumors (7). The amount of cccDNA is
higher in HBeAg-positive than in HBeAg-negative patients (8), whereas
amounts of integrated HBV are higher in HBeAg-negative patients (7).
The primary source of integrated HBV DNA is likely double-stranded
linear HBV DNA (dslDNA), arising as an aberrant replication product
due to mispriming of (+) strand synthesis(9). AlthoughintegratedHBV
DNA is associated with HCC, its function in the maintenance of HBV
infection is unknown.
HBeAg and HBsAg play important roles in chronic infection (10).
HBeAg is thought to induce T cell tolerance to HBeAg and core, which
may contribute to viral persistence (11). This tolerance also predisposes
the infant of an HBeAg-positive mother to allow persistent replication
after infection (12). High HBsAg production is believed to contribute to
T cell exhaustion, resulting in limited or weak T cell responses and even

 deletion of T cells recognizing specific epitopes (13–15). In addition to
enveloping the virion, HBsAg forms as many as 100,000 times more
subviral particles than virions (16). For CHB patients, the desired
endpoint of treatment is seroclearance of HBsAg, referred to as a “func-
tional cure,” resulting in improved long-term prognosis (17, 18). HBsAg
loss is considered a hallmark of effective immune control of HBV (19).
Because high antigen load is believed to play a key role in maintain-
ing chronicity, there is interest in directly reducing expression of viral
antigens and regulatory proteins via RNA interference (RNAi) (20).
The RNAi therapeutic ARC-520 for treatment of chronic HBV infec-
tion comprises an equimolar mixture of liver-tropic cholesterol-
conjugated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) siHBV-74 and siHBV-77
plus an excipient that enables endosomal escape of the siRNAs into the
cytoplasm where RNAi occurs (21). The mRNA target sitesfor siHBV-74
and siHBV-77 are 118 and 71 bases upstream, respectively, of the
conventional HBV PAS (fig. S1). Because all cccDNA-derived HBV tran-
scripts overlap in this region, the siRNAs in ARC-520 would target all of
them, leading to reduction of all viral proteins. This would potentially
enable a host immune response that would result in functional cure.
Here, we report results evaluating ARC-520 in a phase 2 clinical
study in CHB patients and a complementary study in chimpanzees
chronically infected with HBV. Our studies reveal a previously under-
appreciated source of HBsAg, namely, HBV DNA integrated into the
host genome. This has implications for our understanding of HBV bi-
ology and host interactions and for future development of drugs de-
signed with curative intent for CHB patients.
RESULTS
Differential reduction of HBsAg is associated with HBeAg
status and previous exposure to NUCs in CHB patients
treated with ARC-520
Heparc-2001 was a phase 2 clinical study to determine the safety and
tolerability of ARC-520 and its effect on virologic parameters. Individ-
ualand mean patient demographics at study start are presented in tables
S1 and S2, respectively. Initially, CHB patients receiving long-term en-
tecavir (ETV) were enrolled into five 8-patient cohorts and randomized
with a 6:2 (active/placebo) ratio. Patients in cohorts 1 to 4 were
HBeAg-negative, whereas patients in cohort 5 were HBeAg-positive.
ARC-520 was administered as a single intravenous infusion in cohorts
1 to 4, at ascending doses of 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg/kg, whereas patients in
cohort 5 received 4 mg/kg. A sixth cohort of HBeAg-positive patients
received two doses of ARC-520 (2 mg/kg) 2 weeks apart. Cohorts 1 to
6 had been on nucleos(t)ide viral replication inhibitors (NUCs) for 1.2
to 7.8 years before ARC-520 dosing. HBV serum DNA was below the
lower limit of quantitation (<LLOQ) in these patients (table S2). Final-
ly, a seventh, open-label cohort was added, which consists of HBeAg-
negative and HBeAg-positive patients who were NUC-naïve. Daily
ETV was initiated on the same day they received a single dose of
ARC-520 (4 mg/kg). Mean baseline expression of HBsAg was similar
between all cohorts (tables S1 and S2). A total of 58 CHB patients were
successfullydosedincohorts1to7ofthestudy,with48receivingdrugand
10 receiving placebo. There were few adverse events reported (table S3).
No adverse trends were observed in vital signs, physical examinations,
or electrocardiograms. Laboratory values showed no clinically signifi-
cant toxicity. Overall, ARC-520 was well tolerated when administered
to CHB patients, as it was in normal volunteers (20).
We observed modest decreases in HBsAg expression in cohort 1 to
4 patientsthat correlated partially with dose (Fig. 1A). HBsAg expression
decreased most sharply during the first 8 days after dosing in all cohorts,
reaching a plateau before starting to relapse 6 to 8 weeks after dosing. At
the highest dose of 4 mg/kg (cohort 4), HBsAg was reduced by 0.3 log10
relative to baseline. This degree of knockdown was substantially less than
observed in preclinical studies using a mouse model of HBV infection
(21). The mice were HBeAg-positive; however, the HBeAg status of the
patients did not appear to be a factor, because cohort 5 (HBeAg-positive)
patients showed a similar muted response for HBsAg knockdown (Fig.
1B). Similar results from administration of two injections of 2 mg/kg
2 weeks apart in cohort 6, instead of a single dose (4 mg/kg), indi-
cated that saturation of hepatocyte delivery of ARC-520 was an unlikely
explanation for the limited HBsAg knockdown and minimal dose re-
sponsiveness (fig. S2).
The lack of robust HBsAg knockdown was unlikely due to inherent
RNAi inefficiency or lack of ARC-520 efficacy in the CHB patients, as
evidenced by measuring knockdown of other viral parameters. For ex-
ample, measurement of hepatitis B core–related antigen (HBcrAg) in
cohort 1 to 4 patients with quantifiable amounts showed dose-dependent
knockdown, reaching 0.9 log10 mean reduction in patients receiving
4 mg/kg (Fig. 1C). Similar results were observed in cohort 5, with mean
HBcrAg reduction of 0.9 log10 and HBeAg reduction of 1.2 log10 at
nadir (Fig. 1D).
Cohorts 1 to 6 comprised patients who had been on long-term NUC
therapy.To understandwhetherpreviousNUCtherapyaffectedHBsAg
reduction after ARC-520 injection, an additional cohort consisting
of NUC-naïve patients (cohort 7) was studied. Six of these patients
were HBeAg-positive and six were HBeAg-negative, but one of the
positive patients had low HBeAg [<10 Paul Ehrlich Institut units
(PEIU)/ml] and was considered to be transitioning to HBeAg-negative
status. Cohort 7 patients received a single dose of ARC-520 (4 mg/kg)
and began daily ETV dosing on day 1. HBV serum DNA in cohort 7 pa-
tients was higher at baseline in the HBeAg-positive (8 to 9 log10 IU/ml,
excluding the low HBeAg-positive patient) than HBeAg-negative (3
to 5 log10) patients (table S1). HBV DNA production decreased in
HBeAg-positive patients by 4.0 ± 0.6 log10 during the first 3 weeks of
ARC-520 plus NUC treatment and became undetectable in most
HBeAg-negative patients (fig. S3).
Excluding the transitional patient, NUC-naïve HBeAg-positive
patients in cohort 7 responded with deep HBsAg reduction: A 1.4 ±
0.1 log10 reduction in HBsAg (minimum of 1.3 log10 and a maximum
of 1.8 log10 reduction) was observed, along with mean 1.5 ± 0.1 log10
reduction in HBeAg and 1.3 ± 0.1 log10 reduction in HBcrAg (Fig. 1, E
and F). HBsAg in HBeAg-negative cohort 7 patients decreased to a
similar degree as in NUC-experienced HBeAg-negative patients in
cohort 4, but after a delay of about 3 weeks (Fig. 1G). We have no
explanation for this delayed response, but it may be a secondary effect
of knockdown of other viral components on HBsAg expression. The
transitional HBeAg-positive patient demonstrated HBsAg reductions
intermediate to those observed in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative
patients in cohort 7. Together, these results suggested that HBeAg
negativity and previous long-term NUC therapy adversely affected
the ability of ARC-520 to reduce expression of HBsAg.
Differential HBsAg reduction in response to ARC-520 is
associated with HBeAg status in chronically
infected chimpanzees
In addition to the Heparc-2001 clinical trial, we conducted a study of
ARC-520 in chimpanzees chronically infected with HBV. Nine CHB
chimpanzees were available for inclusion in this study: five males and

 four females, five initially HBeAg-positive and four HBeAg-negative
(table S4). Safety and efficacy of repeat dosing of the chimpanzees with
ARC-520 were monitored with regular blood collections for evaluation
of safety parameters and HBV serum DNA, HBsAg, HBeAg, and anti-
HBsAg and anti-HBeAg antibodies. Initial HBsAg expression varied by
four orders of magnitude, and production of HBV serum DNA by more
than six orders of magnitude, providing an opportunity to evaluate the
breadth of ARC-520 efficacy.
The chimpanzees were treated with daily oral NUCs (ETV for all,
and for chimpanzee 4x0139 ETV + tenofovir) for 8 to 24 weeks to re-
duce viralreplication before dosing withARC-520 (Fig. 2A). While con-
tinuing NUC treatment, the chimpanzees were then given ARC-520
once every 4 weeks (Q4W) for a total of 6 to 11 injections. Monitoring
of clinical chemistry and hematology parameters throughout the study
showed that treatment with ARC-520 and NUCs was well tolerated
with no observed toxicity (table S8).
Mean serum HBV DNA production in HBeAg-positive chimpanzees
decreased by 4.0 ± 0.2 log10 copies/ml during NUC lead-in (Fig. 2B). All
HBeAg-negative chimpanzees had quantities of serum DNA close to
the lower limit of detection that became undetectable after 2 weeks of
NUC treatment. After NUC lead-in, the first ARC-520 injection re-
duced mean HBV serum DNA by an additional 1.3 ± 0.1 log10 in
HBeAg-positive chimpanzees (Fig. 2B). HBV DNA continued to be
suppressed during ARC-520 treatment to the degree observed at nadir
after the first dose. Two chimpanzees initially HBeAg-positive, 89A008
and A4A014, seroconverted to HBeAg-negative during the study, and
their serum HBV DNA becomes undetectable.
HBeAg expression changed negligibly during NUC lead-in, with the
exception of HBeAg transitional chimpanzee 89A008 that serocon-
verted for HBeAg during NUC lead-in (Fig. 2C). In the 40 days between
the health check and start of NUC lead-in, HBeAg expression in 89A008
decreased fivefold and then continued to decline 3.5 log10 ng/ml during
the 20-week NUC lead-in. In the other four HBeAg-positive chimpanzees,
mean HBeAg expression was reduced by 1.0 ± 0.1 log10 after the first
ARC-520 injection and remained suppressed to a similar degree
throughout ARC-520 dosing, although HBeAg expression partially re-
bounded from nadir after each injection (Fig. 2C). Chimpanzee
A4A014 became positive for anti-HBe antibodies, and then HBeAg
became undetectable after the fifth ARC-520 injection.
At study initiation, HBsAg expression was an average of 19-fold
higher in the HBeAg-positive than HBeAg-negative chimpanzees (table
S4). Two HBeAg-negative chimpanzees (88A010 and 95A010) pro-
duced amounts of HBsAg similar to those of the two HBeAg-positive
chimpanzees that seroconverted for HBeAg during the study (A4A014
and 89A008), whereas the other two HBeAg-negative chimpanzees
produced two orders of magnitude less (4x0506 and 95A008). HBsAg
expression decreased minimally during NUC lead-in (Fig. 2, D and E).
HBeAg-positive animals responded to the first dose of ARC-520 (2 to
4 mg/kg) with HBsAg reductions of 0.9 to 1.4 log10 4 weeks after in-
jection, whereas the HBeAg-negative chimpanzees responded less well,
with 0.4 to 0.7 log10 reductions at nadir (Fig. 2D). The extent of HBsAg
knockdown appeared not to correlate withproduction of HBsAg at start
of study, but rather with HBeAg status (Fig. 2E). Unlike the more steady
degree of HBV DNA and HBeAg suppression, HBsAg expression grad-
ually decreased throughout the ARC-520 dosing period regardless of
HBeAg status, with the exception of A3A006 (Fig. 2, D and E).
As observed in human patients who had been NUC-naïve before
dosing with ARC-520, HBeAg-positive chimpanzees responded with
much deeper knockdown than HBeAg-negative chimpanzees. Mean

 Fig. 2F. HBsAg knockdown after ARC-520 injection in the three chim-
panzees that remained HBeAg-positive throughout the study (4x0139,
A2A004, and A3A006) was similar to that in A4A014, which became
HBeAg-negative, and there were no apparent differences in effect be-
tween 2 and 4 mg/kg of ARC-520 (Fig. 2, D to F). HBsAg reductions
after ARC-520 treatment of HBeAg transitional chimpanzee 89A008
were intermediate between the HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive
chimpanzees (Fig. 2, D to F), reminiscent of the HBsAg reduction in
the low HBeAg–expressing patient 702 from Heparc-2001 cohort 7
(Fig. 1E).
Abundance and characteristics of HBV DNA and RNA
in the liver differ between HBeAg-positive and
HBeAg-negative chimpanzees
To understand the reason for the differential response to ARC-520 be-
tween HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chimpanzees, and poten-
tially by extension in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative humans, we
characterized the molecular genetics of HBV found in these two chim-
panzee serotypes. Liver biopsies were performed on eight of the chim-
panzees at the prestudy health check, after NUC lead-in on day 1, and at
various time points after ARC-520 injections. These specimens were
divided for isolation of total liver DNA and total liver RNA and for his-
tological evaluation of paraffin-embedded tissue. Chimpanzee 4x0506
was not biopsied because of low prestudy platelet counts.
Prestudy quantities of total HBV DNA in the liver were measured
using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with a probe in
the core region. The HBeAg-positive chimpanzees had 5.9 to 7.8 log10
copies of HBV/mg of host DNA, whereas the HBeAg-negative chimpan-
zees had considerably less (3.6 to 4.4 log10 copies/mg) (fig. S4), consistent
with the lower serum DNA production in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees.

Downloaded from 
 month but did not reduce it in the HBeAg-negative chimpanzees, sug-
gesting that the majority of HBV DNA in the liver of the latter is not
dependent on replication via viral polymerase.
Total HBV DNA includes cccDNA, replication products such as
rcDNA, and integrated HBV. To evaluate the molecular form of
HBV DNA species in the livers, the biopsy samples were treated with
Plasmid-Safe ATP-Dependent DNase (PSD) before qPCR. PSD was de-
veloped to digest contaminating sheared chromosomal DNA in plas-
mid DNA preparations (Epicentre Technologies). PSD has its greatest
activity on fragments of double-stranded DNA and, to a lesser degree,
digests single-stranded DNA; thus, it is expected to be most active on
integrated HBV DNA and, to a lesser degree, on HBV replication inter-
mediates including rcDNA. cccDNA is expected to be resistant to diges-
tion by PSD. We observed that PSD digestion decreased liver HBV
DNA in HBeAg-positive chimpanzee samples by 14 ± 3–fold in the pre-
study samples but by only 1.8 ± 0.2–fold after the NUC lead-in, suggest-
ing a change in the number and/or form of replication products in these
animals treated with NUCs (fig. S4). In contrast, HBV DNA in HBeAg-
negative chimpanzees was more sensitive to PSD digestion during NUC
treatment alone (43 ± 21–fold decrease). These results, along with the
significantly lower HBV liver DNA levels that did not decrease during
NUC treatment, could be explained by a greater proportion of HBV
genomes being integrated in HBeAg-negative compared to HBeAg-
positive chimpanzees. HBV is known to integrate into host chromo-
somal DNA, and human CHB patients are known to have an increasing
number of HBV integrants as the infection progresses (7).
Paired-end sequencing of fragmented liver DNA enriched for HBV-
containing sequences revealed that HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-
negative chimpanzees had HBV DNA integrated into their genomes
(fig. S5). The primary source of integrated HBV DNA is dslDNA, an
in situ primed, aberrant replication product that results when the cap-
containing RNA primer fails to translocate to the downstream direct
repeat 2 (DR2) sequence during plus strand DNA synthesis (9). The
upstream end of dslDNA is at DR1, and the downstream end terminates
in the gap region between DR2 and DR1, the majority ending proximal
to DR1 (fig. S1) (5, 22). Consistent with this mechanism of HBV inte-
gration, the major integration sites in our study chimpanzees were at
DR1. HBeAg-negative chimpanzee 88A010 (25 years old), transitional
89A008 (24 years old), and HBeAg-positive 4x0139 (37 years old) had
the highest number of integration events, whereas HBeAg-positive
A4A014 (the youngest at 9 years old) had the lowest, suggesting a pos-
sible increase in integrated HBV DNA with duration of infection as ob-
served in humans (7). Integrated HBV DNA in 4x0139 was previously
characterized, with results showing a pattern of integration similar to
that seen in our study (23).
HBV transcripts in the liver were evaluated by three distinct ap-
proaches, each of which provides somewhat different but complemen-
tary information. These were reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR),
paired-end next-generation mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq), and
single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (Iso-seq). Total HBV
transcripts in the liver specimens were quantified using an RT-qPCR
probe in the X gene (X probe) that hybridized to a region expected to
be in all cccDNA-derived transcripts (precore, pgRNA, pre-S1, pre-S2/S,
and X). The number of HBV transcripts in three HBeAg-positive chim-
panzees was compared to that in three HBeAg-negative chimpanzees
(Fig. 3A). HBeAg-positive chimpanzee 4x0139 was omitted because
of low X probe efficiency in this animal, and 89A008 was omitted be-
cause it was transitioning to HBeAg-negative status. The mean number
of total transcripts was 18-fold higher in HBeAg-positive chimpanzees
(7.8 to 8.7 log10 copies/mg of RNA) than in HBeAg-negative chimpan-
zees (6.6 to 7.6 log10 copies/mg), similar to the difference in HBsAg ex-
pression between these groups. Short-term treatment with NUCs is not
expected to exert an effect on the level of transcripts, and in both groups
of chimpanzees, total HBV transcripts were not significantly different at
prestudy from those after NUC lead-in (Fig. 3A). Consistent with re-
duction of HBsAg, 1 week after the second ARC-520 injection (day
36), total HBV RNA (with X probe) was reduced 89 ± 2% in three
HBeAg-positive chimpanzees and 62 ± 4% in the HBeAg-negative
chimpanzees. The difference in RNA reduction was similar to the
difference in HBsAg reduction observed in these two groups of chim-
panzees at this time point (Fig. 2F). HBeAg-positive chimpanzee
4x0139 was omitted from this analysis because the X probe appears
to be less efficient in this animal: The core probe detected about 100
times more transcripts than the X probe. Given the high level of HBsAg
production in this chimpanzee, it is unlikely that the HBsAg transcripts
comprise less than 1% of the total, as assay results using this probe
would suggest.
The precore plus pgRNA transcripts can be distinguished from the
total HBV transcripts using a qPCR probe to a conserved sequence in
the core region (Fig. 3B). The precore/pgRNA transcripts comprised
only 3.5 ± 0.5% of the total HBV transcripts in HBeAg-negative chim-
panzees, whereas they comprised 52.6 ± 0.5% of the total in HBeAg-
positive chimpanzees.
Unlike PCR, which requires knowledge of target site sequences and
is less efficient on variants with mismatches to primer or probe, mRNA-
seq analysis accommodates variation (24). Using liver biopsy samples
collected after NUC lead-in, about 40 million sequencing reads with a
length of 50 bases were generated from each total liver RNA sample.

 Histograms were generated by aligning the reads from each chimpanzee
toitsconsensusHBVDNAsequenceobtainedfromliverDNAsequencing
(Fig. 4). A steep decrease in the number of reads just downstream of
the major HBV PAS (sequence TATAAA) in HBeAg-positive chim-
panzees suggests that the majority of HBV transcripts terminate near
this PAS. In the HBeAg-negative chimpanzees, few reads extended be-
yond DR1, and thus, they lacked the major HBV PAS that is located
81 bases downstream of DR1. There was no indication of resistance to
ARC-520 developing, as the dominant sequences at the siRNA target
sites, in those transcripts that contained them, remained similar before
and after multiple ARC-520 doses, and HBV RNA remained sup-
pressed (table S5 and fig. S6). These mRNA-seq results are consistent
with HBsAg transcripts in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees being
produced from integrated dslDNA.
We performed Iso-seq to allow sequencing of the entire full-length
complementary DNA, using total liver RNA from one HBeAg-positive
(A2A004) and one HBeAg-negative (88A010) chimpanzee. Alignment
of the sequencing data from A2A004 to
the HBV genome revealed that the vast
majority (90.5%) of S transcripts had the
expected 5′ and 3′ ends, originating from
the expected promoters and terminating
at the HBV PAS, respectively (Fig. 5A).
In contrast, the 5′ ends of S transcripts
from animal 88A010 mapped to the S
promoters, but in most cases, the 3′ ends
failed to align to HBV beginning in the
DR2-DR1 region upstream of the HBV
PAS (Fig. 5B). These were hybrid tran-
scripts containing HBV sequence fused
to non-HBV sequences. Most HBV tran-
scripts in HBeAg-negative 88A010 were
fused to a chimpanzee sequence (66.4%),
a HBV sequence (10.1%), or a sequence
with unknown origin (0.9%). HBV-
chimpanzee fusion transcripts in this
animal used cryptic chimpanzee PASs
identified as the sequence AATAAA or
with a single base change (table S6).
These sequences were observed within
the 60 bases proximal to the poly(A) se-
quences. The most common PAS was
AATAAA (17.7%), and the majority of
transcripts (55.8%) had more than one
putative PAS. These results demonstrate
that fusion transcripts can use chimpan-
zee putative PAS sequences near their
integration sites and do not require a
bona fide HBV PAS.
The 3′ terminus of dslDNA is lo-
cated between the DR2 and DR1
elements and excludes the major HBV
PAS. As shown in fig. S1, an alternate
PAS (sequence CATAAA) first detected
in HCC tissue is located about 130 bases
upstream of the major PAS (25). HBV
RNA transcripts that terminate at the al-
ternate PAS are referred to as truncated
RNA (trRNA) (26, 27). Some integrated
HBV genomes derived from dslDNA could include this alternate PAS.
This alternate PAS terminus was detected in 32.8% (42 of 128) of the
nonfusion HBV transcripts in the HBeAg-negative chimpanzee, but
only in 0.3% (7 of 2466) of the nonfusion transcripts in the HBeAg-
positive chimpanzee.
If trRNA transcripts are produced from integrated HBV DNA, as
was previously observed in HCC, we would expect them to encode
HBsAg but not HBeAg, core, or polymerase, because the upstream
and adjacent precore/core promoter is deleted in integrated dslDNA.
Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a significant amount of
trRNA encoding HBsAg in the HBeAg-negative chimpanzee liver
RNA along with a majority of transcripts that used a PAS from the
host genome.
Although 90.5% of the HBV transcripts in A2A004 were nonfusion,
only 22.7% were nonfusion from HBeAg-negative 88A010 (Table 1).
Consistent with our DNA-seq and mRNA-seq results, the Iso-seq data
also demonstrate that HBV-chimpanzee integration points are located

 primarily near DR1. A significant portion of these transcripts lack the
target sites for the RNAi triggers in ARC-520.
Deep reduction of HBsAg was observed in HBeAg-negative
chimpanzees treated with siRNA targeting outside the
DR1-DR2 region
We tested the hypothesis that the reason for less efficient ARC-520–
mediated HBsAg reduction in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees was due
to loss of ARC-520 siRNA target sites in the mRNA encoding their
HBsAg. Two HBeAg-negative chimpanzees were treated with siRNA
siHBV-75 that targets a site upstream of the DR1-DR2 region. The oth-
er two chimpanzees continued to receive ARC-520. After the 10th dose
of ARC-520, chimpanzees 4x0506 and 95A008 both had 0.7 log10 re-
duction of HBsAg relative to day 1. After seven doses of ARC-520,
chimpanzees 88A010 and 95A010 had 0.8 and 0.5 log10 HBsAg reduc-
tion, respectively. These two chimpanzees were then dosed three
times (Q4W) with siHBV-75 (4 mg/kg). The HBsAg was reduced by
1.4 and 1.7 log10, 1.9 and 2.4 log10, and finally 2.3 and 3.0 log10 rela-
tive to day 1 after each of the three successive siHBV-75 doses in
88A010 and 95A010, respectively (Fig. 6). These reductions demon-
strated that HBsAg could be just as effectively reduced by RNAi in the
HBeAg-negative chimpanzees as in the HBeAg-positive chimpanzees,
as long as the target site for the siRNA was present in the mRNA.
HBeAg-negative 88A010 and transitional 89A008 both had popula-
tions of hepatocytes in liver biopsies that appeared to be clonal and
stained strongly for accumulated HBsAg, highly suggestive of
integrated HBV (fig. S7). This HBsAg staining was greatly reduced af-
ter treatment with siHBV-75.
DISCUSSION
The differential response to RNAi therapeutic ARC-520 reflected in the
lower magnitude of HBsAg knockdown in HBeAg-negative or NUC-
experienced HBeAg-positive CHB patients in comparison to NUC-
naïve HBeAg-positive CHB patients could not have been predicted
based on current models, which assume that cccDNA is the only signif-
icant source of HBV transcripts. The fact that patients in cohort 7 ini-
tiated NUC therapy on day 1, in contrast to the patients in the other
cohorts that were NUC-experienced, also cannot explain these results,
as it has been previously established that NUCs do not significantly
affect HBsAg expression (28). Instead, our data point to an additional,
previously underrecognized source of HBsAg, namely, integrated
HBV DNA. Evidence for this comes from a variety of observations
as well as direct experimentation. In humans, we show that the minimal
HBsAg knockdown by ARC-520 in poor responders is not due to an
inherent inefficiency of the RNAi machinery, because knockdown of
HBcrAg in these patients was similar in magnitude to HBsAg
knockdown in NUC-naïve HBeAg-positive patients. HBcrAg tran-
scriptscan only be producedfromHBV DNAin whichthe precore/core
promoters are upstream and adjacent to the coding region. This is the
spatial arrangement found in cccDNA, but not in integrated HBV
DNA, hinting that HBcrAg and HBsAg may come from different
HBV DNA sources. HBeAg data in NUC-treated and NUC-naïve
HBeAg-positive patients were consistent with this conclusion.
The availability of chronically infected chimpanzees, which also
showed a differential pattern of response in HBeAg-negative versus
HBeAg-positive serotypes, allowed us to perform a series of investi-
gations to more directly examine the molecular basis for this phenom-
enon. First, we showed that total liver HBV DNA was present at lower
quantities in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees compared to HBeAg-
positive chimpanzees, and the amount of HBV DNA was largely un-
changed by NUCs. This suggests that the majority of the liver HBV
DNA in these HBeAg-negative chimpanzees was not dependent on
active HBV replication but rather represented HBV DNA integrated
into the host chromosome. Second, we demonstrated that the propor-
tion of precore/pgRNA transcripts, expected to arise from cccDNA, to
the total amount of HBV transcripts was minimal in HBeAg-negative
chimpanzees, suggesting that most transcripts were produced from
non-cccDNA such as integrated HBV DNA in the chimpanzees with
this serotype. These data were confirmed using mRNA-seq, which ad-
ditionally revealed that HBV sequences ended before the HBV PAS in
the vast majority of transcripts in HBeAg-negative animals. This points
to transcription from integrated HBV DNA, which has 3′ sequence de-
letions that would include deletion of the HBV PAS, and is consistent
with our mapping of chimpanzee/HBV breakpoints in integrated HBV
DNA. Third, sequencing of full-length HBV transcriptsfrom the liver of
an HBeAg-negative chimpanzee revealed that most were fused to host

quenced with SMRT sequencing. (A) Full-length nonconcatemer reads were aligned

 chimpanzee sequence and that these fusion points fell between DR1 and
DR2, which would be expected if they were expressed from integrated
HBV DNA. Deletion of HBV sequences in this region may include the
target sequences for the RNAi triggers in ARC-520, depending on the
extent of the deletion. Our Iso-seq data showed that this was the case in
the HBeAg-negative chimpanzee. This would explain the decrease in
HBsAg knockdown observed in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees relative
to HBeAg-positive chimpanzees in which the vast majority of HBV
transcripts contained the target sites. Finally, treatment with an RNAi
trigger that targeted a sequence upstream of these deletions resulted in a
degree of HBsAg knockdown in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees that was
comparable to that in HBeAg-positive chimpanzees. Although minor
variations in the process of HBV DNA integration may exist between
humans and chimpanzees, our mapping data and those presented by
others suggest that the processes are remarkably similar (22, 23, 29).
We interpret the data in toto to indicate that integrated HBV DNA is
a substantial source of HBsAg in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees,
HBeAg-negative patients, and NUC-experienced HBeAg-positive pa-
tients with low cccDNA.
Despite the well-documented occurrence of HBV DNA integration,
only minimal, if any, HBsAg was thought to be produced from
integrated HBV DNA. However, integrated HBV DNA has been de-
tected in HBsAg-positive individuals with no detectable HBV serum
DNA (30). Others previously described in histological liver samples
from CHB patients that the hepatocytes that stained for HBsAg were
distinct from those that stained for core (31), and HBsAg-containing
hepatocytes were often in clusters, consistent with clonal populations
(32). We also observed prominent HBsAg staining suggestive of clonal

entirely HBV sequence, HBV-chimpanzee fusion sequence, HBV-HBV fusion sequence, or HBV fused to an unknown sequence.

Downloaded from 
 hepatocyte populations in an HBeAg-negative chimpanzee and the
HBeAg transitional chimpanzee, but not in the HBeAg-positive chim-
panzees. These data could be explained by significant HBsAg expression
from integrated HBV DNA without actively transcribed cccDNA in the
same hepatocytes. Tu et al. demonstrated that such clonal populations
harboring integrated HBV DNA cannot result from random hepatocyte
turnover but rather have a selective advantage that is not due to preneo-
plasia (22). Although the reason for this advantage is not completely
understood, many of the clones in that study were shown to contain
HBsAg. Having a means of producing HBsAg that is not dependent
on viral replication or production of other potentially antigenic viral
proteins may help sustain suppression of the immune system and allow
for continued virion production. A single HBV genome can lead to in-
fection of every hepatocyte (33). Thus, just a few cccDNA-containing
cells able to escape immunosurveillance can maintain chronic infection
and only complete immune control of HBsAg can be expected to pre-
vent reinfection and result in a functional cure.
Integrated HBV DNA as a source of HBsAg may also help explain
why amounts of HBsAg and serum HBV DNA correlate in untreated
HBeAg-positive, chronically HBV infected individuals, particularly
those with high HBV serum DNA, but correlate less well or not at all
in HBeAg-negative patients and in those on NUC therapy (34–37). If
integrated DNA produces HBsAg, then its production would be rela-
tively independent of HBV DNA replication and thus HBV serum
DNA production, in line with a recent study showing minimal change
of HBsAg expression despite achievement of undetectable cccDNA in
patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs for more than 5 years (37).
In addition, a low amount of cccDNA resulting from chronic NUC
therapy in cohort 5 patients before treatment with ARC-520 would
explain the more limited HBsAg knockdown achieved in these HBeAg-
positive patients relative to HBeAg-positive patients in cohort 7, which
had not been exposed to chronic NUC therapy. ARC-520 and NUCs
might be expected to have synergistic activity on inhibition of cccDNA
replenishment, as ARC-520 degrades pgRNA and viral proteins
involved in replication, whereas NUCs directly inhibit replication, but
this study was not designed to address potential synergism.
A limitation of this work is that the numbers of chimpanzees and
treatment-naïve HBV-infected patients (cohort 7) in this study were re-
latively small. However, the reduction in HBsAg in response to ARC-
520 in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees and humans were similar, as were
the responses in HBeAg-positive chimpanzees and humans, and the
magnitude of the differences dependent on HBeAg status was large
and nonoverlapping.
Our finding that integrated HBV DNA can serve as a source of
HBsAg has implications for design of next-generation antivirals to treat
CHB. For example, that HBsAg appears to be produced from integrated
HBV DNA rather than solely from cccDNA implies that eliminating
cccDNA will likely not eliminate HBsAg. Immune control that prevents
reinfection and allows clearance of the virus remains the desired
endpoint. Loss of HBsAg is the more relevant biomarker of immune
control. This is likely the case whether the HBsAg is produced from
cccDNA or from integrated HBV DNA. In a virus as evolutionarily suc-
cessful as HBV, the abundant production of HBsAg may serve a critical
function in the maintenance of CHB.
The increased understanding of HBsAg dynamics during chronic
infection gained by the current investigation will lead to enhanced op-
portunities to reduce HBsAg expression and potentially allow the host
immune response to eliminate residual infected cells. Direct RNAi-
mediated reduction of HBsAg in the liver has the potential to improve
the prognosis for infected individuals, but should take into account both
cccDNA and integrated HBV DNA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study designs
Clinical trial Heparc-2001 (NCT 02065336)
The study aimed to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmaco-
logical effect of ARC-520 in CHB patients with or without preceding
chronic NUC treatment. Initially, patients receiving chronic ETV were
enrolled sequentially into five cohorts, 8 subjects per cohort, and rando-
mized with a 6:2 (active/placebo) ratio (table S1). Each subject was as-
signed to either active (ARC-520) or placebo (0.9% normal saline)
treatment using a block randomization algorithm. After completion
of cohort4 and while cohort 5 wasrecruiting, the protocolwas amended
to addcohort 6 and subsequently cohort 7 in open-label fashion without
placebo groups. Patient selection and additional study details are in the
Supplementary Materials.
Blood samples were collected before dose and at specified times after
dosing to determine safety, pharmacokinetic (cohorts 1 to 5), pharma-
codynamic (cytokines and complement), and HBV serology parameters.
Patients were pretreated with antihistamine (chlorpheniramine; 8 mg
orally) 2 hours before treatment administration and continued (cohorts
1 to 6) or started (cohort 7) daily oral ETV on day 1 (0.5 mg/day orally),
continuing throughout the study.
ARC-520, supplied by Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, was ad-
ministered as a single intravenous infusion at ascending doses of 1, 2,
3, and 4 mg/kg, administered intravenously by clinical staff at the in-
fusion rate of 10 mg/min.
The study was performed in accordance with the 2008 Declaration
of Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines and was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital
Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (Queen Mary Hospital, Hong
Kong) and the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong–New Terri-
tories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Prince of
Wales Hospital, Hong Kong). All subjects gave written informed con-
sent before screening.
Chimpanzee study
This study aimed to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmaco-
logical effect of ARC-520 in nine available HBsAg-positive CHB chim-
panzees (Pan troglodytes), as shown in table S4. Characteristics of viral
genomes are shown in table S7. Chimpanzees were treated with daily
oral NUC for a lead-in period and then in conjunction with ARC-
520 dosing (table S4). All chimpanzees were given oral ETV, 0.5 mg
daily for lamivudine-naïve chimpanzees and 1.0 mg daily for chimpan-
zees with previous exposure to lamivudine. Beginning on study day 108
and continuing through the ARC-520 dosing period, chimpanzee
4x0139 was dosed in addition to ETV with daily tenofovir (300-mg pe-
diatric formulation) to further reduce viral load in this high replicating
chimpanzee (38). After NUC lead-in, chimpanzees were dosed with
ARC-520 Q4W for 6 to 11 doses. Five to 10 min before ARC-520 dosing
(4 mg/kg), chimpanzees were given a 50-mg intravenous bolus of di-
phenhydramine as a precautionary measure to avoid infusion reaction.
Dosing withsiHBV-75+ ARC-EX1 wasperformed identically to dosing
with ARC-520. Blood samples were collected before dose and at speci-
fied times after dosing to determine clinical chemistry, hematology, and
HBV serology parameters (Supplementary Materials). Animal experi-
mentation was conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
