A principal goal of cancer nanomedicine is to deliver therapeutics
effectively to cancer cells within solid tumors. However, there are
a series of biological barriers that impede nanomedicine from
reaching target cells. Here, we report a stimuli-responsive clustered
nanoparticle to systematically overcome these multiple barriers by
sequentially responding to the endogenous attributes of the tumor
microenvironment. The smart polymeric clustered nanoparticle
(iCluster) has an initial size of ∼100 nm, which is favorable for long
blood circulation and high propensity of extravasation through tu-
mor vascular fenestrations. Once iCluster accumulates at tumor sites,
the intrinsic tumor extracellular acidity would trigger the discharge
of platinum prodrug-conjugated poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (di-
ameter ∼5 nm). Such a structural alteration greatly facilitates tumor
penetration and cell internalization of the therapeutics. The internal-
ized dendrimer prodrugs are further reduced intracellularly to re-
lease cisplatin to kill cancer cells. The superior in vivo antitumor
activities of iCluster are validated in varying intractable tumor mod-
els including poorly permeable pancreatic cancer, drug-resistant can-
cer, and metastatic cancer, demonstrating its versatility and broad
applicability.

O
ver the past few decades, nanomedicine has emerged as a
promising means to deliver anticancer therapeutics to tumors
as a result of its preferential and selective accumulation at tumor
sites via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect
(1–4). However, cancer nanomedicine encounters a series of
biological barriers from the site of i.v. injection to the site of
action (5). These challenges can be briefly summarized as circu-
lation in the blood stream, extravasation from blood vessels and
accumulation at tumor sites, deep penetration into the tumor
interstitium, internalization by cancer cells, and intracellular drug
release (6). These obstacles existing in the body could considerably
prevent nanomedicine from reaching its targets in a sufficient drug
concentration (7, 8). To overcome these barriers, a variety of strat-
egies have been envisioned (9–18). Despite great advances, these
strategies have mainly focused on one or a few biological barriers
and led to suboptimal therapeutic effect.
It is known that physical properties of nanoparticles such as
size, shape, and surface charge have profound effects on systemic
transport of the nanoparticles in solid tumors (19–21). Due to
aberrant vasculature, elevated interstitial fluid pressure, and dense
extracellular matrix in the tumor microenvironment, nanoparticles
have to overcome considerable interstitial transport hindrance to
achieve deep and uniform tumor penetration (7). Such a transport
process highly relies on much slower diffusion rather than faster
convective transport because of the inherently large sizes of
nanoparticles compared with small therapeutics (22). Particle
size plays a vital role in dominating the penetration of nanoparticles
into tumor tissue as diffusion scales inversely with particle size
(23–25). Larger nanoparticles, despite being more advantageous
for improved pharmacokinetics and high propensity of vascular
extravasation (26), are inherently unfavorable for tumor penetra-
tion due to their huge diffusional hindrance in the tumor inter-
stitial space (23, 24). This is also recognized as a reason for the
clinically approved Doxil (∼90 nm) only showing modest thera-
peutic benefits (27). In contrast, smaller nanoparticles show much
better tumor penetration (27–30), but very small particles typically
suffer from short half-life time and insufficient tumor accumula-
tion because of their rapid clearance (31, 32). Therefore, an ideal
delivery system should be relatively larger in its initial size to
achieve longer circulation and selective extravasation (33), but once
“docking” at tumor sites, it should be switchable to small particles
to facilitate tumor penetration. Such a requirement has promoted
the recent development of stimuli-responsive nanoparticles that
are able to shrink their sizes by responding to enzymes or UV
light (15, 34). Although conceptually impressive, those systems
are still at an early stage of development. Developing more
sophisticated nanomedicines that are capable of systematically
overcoming the sequential barriers in a concerted fashion, and
are also applicable to a broad range of cancer types, remains
formidably challenging.
Here we report the development of stimuli-responsive clus-
tered nanoparticles to systematically overcome these multiple
Significance
Successively overcoming a series of biological barriers that
cancer nanotherapeutics would encounter upon intravenous
administration is required for achieving positive treatment
outcomes. A hurdle to this goal is the inherently unfavorable
tumor penetration of nanoparticles due to their relatively large
sizes. We developed a stimuli-responsive clustered nanoparticle
(iCluster) and justified that its adaptive alterations of physico-
chemical properties (e.g. size, zeta potential, and drug release
rate) in accordance with the endogenous stimuli of the tumor
microenvironment made possible the ultimate overcoming of
these barriers, especially the bottleneck of tumor penetration.
Results in varying intractable tumor models demonstrated sig-
nificantly improved antitumor efficacy of iCluster than its control
groups, demonstrating that overcoming these delivery barriers
can be achieved by innovative nanoparticle design.

 barriers to cancer chemotherapy. The nanoparticles were con-
structed through molecular assembly of platinum (Pt) prodrug-
conjugated poly(amidoamine)-graft-polycaprolactone (PCL-
CDM-PAMAM/Pt) with PCL homopolymer and poly(ethylene
glycol)-b-poly(e-caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL) copolymer (Fig. 1
A and B). PEG-b-PCL is used to offer the stealth layer, whereas
PCL is chosen to control the size and stability. The nanoparticles are
able to function adaptively in the body through precisely responding
to the physiological pH, tumor extracellular acidity, and intracellular
reductive environment, respectively (Fig. 1B). At physiological pH,
the clustered nanoparticles hold the size around 100 nm and have
high propensity for long blood circulation and enhanced tumor ac-
cumulation through the EPR effect. Then, the acidic tumor extra-
cellular pH (pHe ∼6.5–7.2) (35, 36) triggers the release of small
PAMAM prodrugs (∼5 nm) that enable deep and uniform tumor
penetration to reach more cancer cells. Finally, the PAMAM
prodrugs can be rapidly reduced in the reductive cytosol to re-
lease active and potent cisplatin to kill cancer cells and lead to
robust antitumor efficacy (37).
Results
Preparation and Characterization of the Clustered Nanoparticles. To
prepare the clustered nanoparticles, the polymer components PCL,
PEG-b-PCL, and PCL-CDM-PAMAM/Pt were synthesized. The
structures and molecular weights of PEG-b-PCL and PCL were char-
acterized (SI Appendix, Figs. S1 and S2). For PCL-CDM-PAMAM/Pt
synthesis, PCL was first reacted with 2-propionic-3-methylmaleic
anhydride (CDM) to produce PCL-CDM (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
A Pt prodrug c,c,t-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2(OH)(O2CCH2CH2CO2H)] was
conjugated to PAMAM to afford PAMAM/Pt, which was fur-
ther coupled to PCL-CDM through the reaction of the amino
groups of PAMAM with the CDM anhydride residue (SI Ap-
pendix, Scheme S1). The resultant amide bond is acid labile
(38) and will be cleaved at pHe to release PAMAM at
tumor sites.
The Pt-containing pH-instable clustered nanoparticle (iCluster/Pt)
was prepared from coassembly of PCL-CDM-PAMAM/Pt, PEG-
b-PCL, and PCL by nanoprecipitation method. The weight ratio of
PCL-CDM-PAMAM/Pt:PEG-b-PCL:PCL was optimized as 1:1:1
based on size and size distribution (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig.
S4). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that the diameter of
iCluster/Pt was around 104.1 nm (Fig. 1C), which was consistent
with the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation
(Fig. 1D). TEM images showed clearly that iCluster/Pt had a
raspberry-like structure, presumably due to the presence of
PAMAM dendrimers surrounding the hydrophobic core. Each
iCluster/Pt contained 108 PAMAM and 719 platinum drugs, as
estimated by static light scattering. For comparison, we prepared a
pH-stable clustered nanoparticle (Cluster/Pt) by replacing PCL-
CDM-PAMAM/Pt with its nonresponsive counterpart PCL-
PAMAM/Pt (SI Appendix, Scheme S2). Each Cluster/Pt contained
90 PAMAM and 573 platinum drugs and showed similar mor-
phology, size, and zeta potential as iCluster/Pt (Fig. 1 E and F and
SI Appendix, Table S2).
One key design of iCluster/Pt is its sensitivity to biological
stimuli such as the acidic pHe and elevated intracellular redox
milieu. To test its response to pHe, we incubated iCluster/Pt in a
tumor-acidity mimic phosphate buffer (PB) solution at pH 6.8
over predetermined time and observed its morphological evo-
lution under TEM. After a 4-h incubation, the raspberry-like
morphology of iCluster/Pt was partially deformed and small
particles appeared in the solution (Fig. 1D, Middle). After an
additional incubation for 24 h, the raspberry structure was almost
completely disintegrated (Fig. 1D, Right and SI Appendix, Fig.
S5) and changed to a smooth surface that was analogous to
nanoparticles formed by PEG-PCL and PCL (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6A). Meanwhile, plenty of small nanoparticles were observed in
the surroundings, with size comparable to PAMAM (SI Appen-
dix, Fig. S6B), suggesting that small PAMAM dendrimers were
released upon cleavage of the amide bond at pH 6.8. In contrast,
Cluster/Pt maintained its initial morphology and size under
identical conditions (Fig. 1F).
Next, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was
used to monitor and compare the release kinetics of PAMAM

 from fluorescein (Flu)-labeled clustered nanoparticles (iClusterFlu
and ClusterFlu). At pH 7.4, iClusterFlu could generally maintain
its stability with ∼12% PAMAM release after a 4-h incubation.
However, incubation at pH 6.8 resulted in ∼60% cumulative
release by another 4 h (Fig. 1G) and ∼90% release by 24 h (SI
Appendix, Fig. S6C), indicating much faster release of PAMAM
at acidic pH. In contrast, ClusterFlu showed minimal release at
either pH 7.4 or 6.8 (Fig. 1H). The nanoparticles are designed to
release cisplatin specifically in the redox environment (39). To
test the release of cisplatin, we incubated the nanoparticles in PB
solutions (pH 7.4 and 6.8), and ascorbic acid solution (5 mM, pH
7.4), an intracellular redox environment mimic solution (40),
respectively, and quantified Pt drug release via inductively cou-
pled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Both nanoparticles
showed minimal drug release in PB solutions regardless of pH,
but rapid release in the redox environment (Fig. 1 G and H).
Blood plasma showed minimal effect on the stability and pH
responsiveness of iCluster (SI Appendix, Fig. S7).
Penetration and Cell Apoptosis in Multicellular Spheroids. We chose
multicellular spheroids (MCSs) derived from BxPC-3 human
pancreatic cancer cells as an in vitro tumor model to evaluate
the penetration and cell killing efficacy of the clustered nano-
particles. Compared with single-layer adherent cells, MCSs have
been proposed as a versatile 3D model to study tumor biology
and to screen therapeutic agents (41). iCluster and Cluster
were dual labeled with two dyes (denoted as RhBiClusterFlu and
RhBClusterFlu), in which PAMAM was labeled with fluorescein
(Flu, green), whereas the PCL component of the hydrophobic
core was labeled with rhodamine B (RhB, red). MCSs were in-
cubated with RhBiClusterFlu or RhBClusterFlu for 15 min, 4 h, and
24 h at pH 6.8, then washed and observed under confocal laser
scanning microscopy (CLSM, Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
For RhBiClusterFlu treatment, the red fluorescence from the hy-
drophobic core attached to the periphery of MCSs, and no no-
ticeable fluorescence was detected in the internal area by 24 h.
Instead, the green signals from PAMAM inside MCSs clearly
increased over time, demonstrating the improved penetration of
PAMAM. By contrast, both red and green fluorescence signals
from nonresponsive RhBClusterFlu were on the peripheral region
of the MCSs by 24 h, revealing limited penetration of larger
particles. Quantitative analysis indicated that more than 10-fold
higher green fluorescence was detected in RhBiClusterFlu-treated
MCSs than in RhBClusterFlu-treated ones (Fig. 2B). These results
provide clear evidence that the size-changeable iCluster has
better tumor penetration.
Next, cell internalization of both nanoparticles was studied by
flow cytometry (FACS) and ICP-MS, respectively. In FACS anal-
ysis, MCSs were treated with iClusterFlu, ClusterFlu, or PAMAMFlu
at pH 6.8 for 4 h and 24 h. Compared with ClusterFlu treatment,
the population of positive cells treated with iClusterFlu was 1.7-fold
higher and 3-fold higher at 4 h (P < 0.05) and 24 h (P < 0.001),
respectively (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S9). For ICP-MS
analysis, Fig. 2D shows that iCluster/Pt treatment resulted in sig-
nificantly higher intracellular accumulation of Pt than Cluster/Pt
treatment (2.6-fold, P < 0.001). Moreover, DNA of MCS cells were
isolated after a 24-h incubation, and the amount of Pt binding to
these DNA in MCS cells receiving iCluster/Pt treatment was sig-
nificantly higher than that receiving Cluster/Pt treatment (3.6-fold,
P < 0.001, Fig. 2E). Apoptosis results indicated that iCluster/Pt
treatment showed 38.6% total cell apoptosis, which was signifi-
cantly higher than Cluster/Pt treatment (14.3%, P < 0.001, Fig. 2F
and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Of note, in all experiments, iCluster
treatment showed comparable efficacy to PAMAM treatment.
Antitumor Activity and Tumor Penetration in a BxPC-3 Pancreatic
Tumor Model. The superior performance of iCluster/Pt in MCSs
further compelled us to study its in vivo activities. We first studied
the pharmacokinetic profiles of the clustered nanoparticles. As
shown in Fig. 3A, both iCluster/Pt and Cluster/Pt exhibited pro-
longed half-life time (T1/2 > 10 h) in the bloodstream compared
with PAMAM/Pt and cisplatin, which is reasonable because
iCluster/Pt and Cluster/Pt are PEGylated nanoparticles. Other
pharmacokinetic parameters also revealed better performance of
the two PEGylated nanoparticles (SI Appendix, Table S3). Next,
we studied the antitumor activity of iCluster/Pt in nude mice
bearing BxPC-3 human pancreatic tumors, which is recognized as
a notoriously poorly permeable and intractable tumor model (27).
As shown in Fig. 3B, free cisplatin and PAMAM/Pt displayed
modest therapeutic efficacy, with 38% and 45% tumor inhibition
versus PBS control, whereas Cluster/Pt showed 57% tumor in-
hibition. In contrast, iCluster/Pt exhibited significant suppression
of tumor growth, reaching 88% tumor suppression (P < 0.001,
versus Cluster/Pt treatment). The average weight of the tumor
mass excised at the end of treatment also demonstrated the same
trend (SI Appendix, Fig. S11A). Histological analyses, including
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end (TUNEL) staining, also

 indicated that iCluster/Pt treatment markedly reduced prolif-
erative cells while increasing apoptotic cells (SI Appendix,
Fig. S12). To investigate dose effect of iCluster/Pt on the
inhibition of BxPC-3 tumors, a separate set of in vivo studies with
injection dose varying from 1.5 to 6.0 mg/kg was performed. As
shown in Fig. 3C, compared with PBS control, all of the iCluster/
Pt treatments showed dramatic tumor growth suppression, with
inhibition rate of 71%, 92%, and 107% for the dose of 1.5, 4.5,
and 6.0 mg/kg, respectively. It is noteworthy that tumor shrinkage
was observed for the 6.0 mg/kg treatment. Slight weight loss was
observed for mice receiving free cisplatin and the 6.0 mg/kg
treatments, whereas no obvious weight loss from other treatments
was observed (SI Appendix, Fig. S11 B and C). Additionally, tissue
staining and blood tests revealed that the clustered nanoparticles
did not cause detectable toxicities to the mice (SI Appendix, Figs.
S13 and S14).
The distribution of the Pt drug in other major organs was not
significantly different between iCluster/Pt and Cluster/Pt treat-
ments (SI Appendix, Fig. S15). However, iCluster/Pt was able to
significantly enhance Pt drug accumulation in tumor tissues
compared with other treatments, with ∼2-fold higher drug con-
centration than Cluster/Pt (P < 0.01 for 12 h, and P < 0.05 for
24 h) and at least 7-fold higher than free cisplatin and PAMAM/Pt
(Fig. 3D). To get more details, we digested the tumor mass into
individual cells and quantified Pt content in these cells by ICP-MS.
iCluster/Pt showed two to three times higher internalization of
Pt than Cluster/Pt (P < 0.05 for 12 h and P < 0.001 for 24 h; Fig. 3E).
To further distinguish tumor cells from other stromal cells in the
heterogeneous tumor tissue, we established tumor models by sub-
cutaneously injecting green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing
BxPC-3 cells in nude mice. After injecting these drug-containing
formulations, GFP-positive tumor cells were isolated and sorted
by FACS and subjected to ICP-MS to determine Pt content. In
these GFP-positive tumor cells, iCluster/Pt still showed signifi-
cantly higher Pt content than Cluster/Pt at 12 h (2.7-fold, P < 0.05)
and 24 h (3-fold, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3F).
iCluster/Pt and Cluster/Pt have similar size, surface property,
and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream. The enhanced deposit
of iCluster/Pt in tumor tissues and tumor cells is presumed to be
associated with its superior tumor penetration. To test our
hypothesis, we used immunofluorescence staining and real-time
CLSM observation to study the intratumoral microdistribution of
RhBiClusterFlu and
RhBClusterFlu. In the immunofluorescence
staining study, for RhBiClusterFlu treatment, the green fluorescence
from PAMAM showed a uniform perfusion in the tumor inter-
stitium, whereas the red fluorescence was highly colocalized with
the blood vessels (yellow). This suggests that RhBiClusterFlu can
release PAMAM at tumor sites and the released PAMAM enables
efficient extravasation and penetration into deep tumor space,
whereas the larger residual nanoparticles are mainly restricted in
the blood vessels or the peripheral areas (Fig. 4A, Upper). For the
nonresponsive
RhBClusterFlu, both green and red signals were
colocalized with the blood vessels, indicating its inability to diffuse
into tumor space (Fig. 4A, Lower). The quantitative analysis of
overlap coefficient of red and yellow, as well as green and yellow
also showed the same trend (SI Appendix, Fig. S16). These results
substantiate previous observations that smaller nanoparticles are
more advantageous for deep tumor penetration than larger ones
because of their reduced diffusional hindrance (23, 42). To further
visualize real-time extravasation and tumor penetration of these
nanoparticles, intravital CLSM was used. For RhBiClusterFlu in-
jection (Fig. 4B), strong green and red fluorescence signals were
confined in the blood vessels at 10 min postinjection. By 90 min,
the green fluorescence in the blood vessels weakened, whereas
more green signals extravasated from the blood vessels and dis-
tributed dispersedly in the surroundings. In contrast, the red fluo-
rescence still remained within the blood vessels. To quantitatively
analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of the fluorescence, we nor-
malized the fluorescence intensity of each color to its initial in-
tensity at 10 min to afford the time and penetration depth-
dependent profiles (Fig. 4C). At 90 min postinjection, nearly 50%
of the original intensity of green fluorescence from PAMAM could
be detected until 70 μm from the blood vessels, whereas red signals
from the larger residual nanoparticles were not detectable beyond
the blood vessels. This trend became even more evident by 240 min
postinjection. The green fluorescence inside blood vessels di-
minished markedly while spreading more uniformly in the tumor
interstitial space. The quantitative data showed that 25% of the
original intensity was still detectable at 160 μm from the blood ves-
sels. The red fluorescence inside the blood vessels weakened as well,
but no red fluorescence was observed beyond the vascular wall. In
contrast, both the green and red signals from the RhBClusterFlu
were confined to the blood vessels over 240 min, suggesting
poor tumor penetration of large RhBClusterFlu nanoparticles (SI
Appendix, Fig. S17).
Antitumor Activity in Drug-Resistant and Metastatic Tumor Models.
To verify the broad applicability of iCluster/Pt in cancer chemo-
therapy, we further investigated its antitumor activities in cisplatin-
resistant A549R human lung cancer and 4T1 metastatic murine
breast cancer models. In the A549R model, different formulations
showed remarkable differences in antitumor activities. Compared

 with PBS control, free cisplatin exhibited minimal tumor growth in-
hibition (only 10% inhibition), whereas PAMAM/Pt showed a slightly
better effect (∼20% inhibition). In comparison, the long-circulating
Cluster/Pt showed considerable enhancement in tumor growth
inhibition (60% inhibition). However, the most effective antitu-
mor effect was achieved by iCluster/Pt treatment, reaching 95%
inhibition (Fig. 5A, P < 0.001). Of note, the significance between
iCluster/Pt and Cluster/Pt appeared as early as day 9 post-
injection. No obvious body weight loss was observed for the
nanoparticle formulations (SI Appendix, Fig. S18), and histo-
logical staining also confirmed the improved therapeutic effect
of iCluster/Pt, showing reduction in proliferation while in-
creasing the apoptosis of tumor cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S19).
To further extend the applicability of our strategy to combat
metastatic cancer, we established a highly invasive and metastatic
4T1 orthotopic tumor model, which is known to be more aggres-
sive and more refractory to chemotherapy than a s.c. tumor model
(43). The mice were treated with varying Pt-containing formulations,
and their survival curves were recorded. Compared with PBS and
blank iCluster control groups, all other treatments showed improved
median survival time. In particular, the iCluster/Pt treatment im-
proved survival time by 74.2%, with significantly longer time to end
point than that of Cluster/Pt (Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Table S4). The
comparison of intratumoral microdistribution of RhBiClusterFlu and
RhBClusterFlu in A549R and 4T1 tumor tissues also demonstrated
that iCluster showed much better tumor penetration than Cluster
because of their pHe-activated PAMAM release at the tumor site (SI
Appendix, Figs. S20 and S21), once again indicating that the improved
antitumor activities of iCluster are highly associated with enhanced
tumor penetration.
Discussion
Despite the fact that nanoparticle-based therapeutics are amena-
ble to preferential accumulation in solid tumors by taking ad-
vantage of the EPR effect, they encounter a series of sequential
biological barriers upon i.v. administration, which severely impede
the achievement of optimal therapeutic outcomes. To adequately
address these barriers and achieve effective therapy, nanoparticles
must be rationally designed to overcome substantial interstitial
transport hindrance brought about by their inherently large sizes
to realize deep and uniform tumor penetration (7). In this study,
our iCluster system enables its basic physicochemical properties to
adaptively change in response to the endogenous stimuli of the
tumor microenvironment to accomplish improved therapeutic ef-
ficacy by successively increasing blood circulation and tumor vas-
cular extravasation, improving tumor penetration, facilitating cell
internalization, and accelerating intracellular drug release.
Our results demonstrate that the decisive step for the effec-
tiveness of iCluster is its robust tumor penetration achieved
through pHe-triggered shattering of small PAMAM dendrimers
at tumor sites (Figs. 3 and 4). It has been validated that the
penetration of nanoparticles in tumor space relies heavily on
particle size, with the consensus that smaller particles have im-
proved tissue penetration (26, 33, 44). Such progress has recently
inspired interest in developing size-shrinkable anticancer drug
delivery systems (15, 34, 45, 46). Compared with previous stud-
ies, our strategy has several unique features. First, previous de-
livery systems simply focused on size-shrinkage medicated tumor
penetration, whereas our system is devised to systematically
overcome a series of barriers including tumor penetration.
Achieving this goal is vitally important because these barriers are
interconnected, and simply overcoming one individual barrier is
not adequate to produce proper therapeutic outcomes (42, 47).

 Second, the stimuli that were used to trigger size shrinkage
previously were either by enzyme or UV light, whose applica-
bility, to a certain extent, would be restricted to only a subset of
cancer types owing to either the heterogeneous expression levels
of target enzymes in a specific cancer type or the superficial pen-
etration depth of UV light (14). In contrast, we used acidic ex-
tracellular pH, a more general hallmark of the microenvironment
of most solid tumors (36, 48), as the stimulus to activate the release
of small particles at tumor sites. This endows our strategy with
much broader specificity and applicability, which has been partially
justified by the superior antitumor activities in multiple tumor
models. Third, it should be noted that it is the postshrinkage size
rather than the property of size shrinkage that is the pivotal de-
terminant of therapeutic efficacy. This is particularly important for
treating poorly permeable solid tumors, because only the sub–30-nm
micelles could penetrate the poorly permeable pancreatic tumors
to achieve an antitumor effect (27). For previous systems, their
final sizes after shrinkage were still as large as 40–70 nm (34, 45,
46), which is likely to offset the usefulness of size shrinkage for
treating poorly permeable tumors. In our system, the released
small PAMAM dendrimer prodrugs have a size of around 5 nm,
which is highly potent in penetrating the intractable tumors to
reach cancer cells that are far away from the blood vessels. In es-
sence, our design strategy may open up a new avenue for the
creation of the next generation of nanotherapeutics, representing a
paradigm shift in nanoparticle-based drug delivery.
