IMPORTANCE Uninsured and insured but out-of-network emergency department (ED)
patients are often billed hospital chargemaster prices, which exceed amounts typically paid
by insurers.
OBJECTIVE To examine the variation in excess charges for services provided by emergency
medicine and internal medicine physicians.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis was conducted of professional
fee payment claims made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for all services
provided to Medicare Part B fee-for-service beneficiaries in calendar year 2013. Data analysis
was conducted from January 1 to July 31, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Markup ratios for ED and internal medicine professional
services, defined as the charges submitted by the hospital divided by the Medicare allowable
amount.
RESULTS Our analysis included 12 337 emergency medicine physicians from 2707 hospitals
and 57 607 internal medicine physicians from 3669 hospitals in all 50 states. Services
provided by emergency medicine physicians had an overall markup ratio of 4.4 (340% excess
charges), which was greater than the markup ratio of 2.1 (110% excess charges) for all services
performed by internal medicine physicians. Markup ratios for all ED services ranged by
hospital from 1.0 to 12.6 (median, 4.2; interquartile range [IQR], 3.3-5.8); markup ratios for all
internal medicine services ranged by hospital from 1.0 to 14.1 (median, 2.0; IQR, 1.7-2.5). The
median markup ratio by hospital for ED evaluation and management procedure codes varied
between 4.0 and 5.0. Among the most common ED services, laceration repair had the highest
median markup ratio (7.0); emergency medicine physician review of a head computed
tomographic scan had the greatest interhospital variation (range, 1.6-27.7). Across hospitals,
markups in the ED were often substantially higher than those in the internal medicine
department for the same services. Higher ED markup ratios were associated with hospital
for-profit ownership (median, 5.7; IQR, 4.0-7.1), a greater percentage of uninsured patients
seen (median, 5.0; IQR, 3.5-6.7 for �20% uninsured), and location (median, 5.3; IQR, 3.8-6.8
for the southeastern United States).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Across hospitals, there is wide variation in excess charges on
ED services, which are often priced higher than internal medicine services. Our results inform
policy efforts to protect uninsured and out-of-network patients from highly variable pricing.

 P
atients presenting to different emergency depart-
ments (ED) can face widely varying charges for similar
care.1 Hospitals use chargemasters (list of services and
their charges) to compile each patient's bill, but the actual pay-
ment depends on the patient’s insurance type and network
status.2 In-network patients and their insurers usually pay dis-
counted amounts, whereas uninsured and out-of-network pa-
tients may be liable for the full hospital charges.3 In 2012, the
50 hospitals in the United States with the highest markups
charged patients at least 9.2 times what the Medicare pro-
gram would pay for care.4
Excess charges, or “markups,”5,6 on medical services can
impose a significant financial burden on uninsured and out-
of-networkpatients.Medicalbillsaretheleadingcauseofbank-
ruptcy and contribute to some patients electing to avoid nec-
essary care.5,7-9 Understanding markups in the ED is especially
important because uninsured and out-of-network patients
commonly seek care in the ED, and the often acute nature of
the medical services needed prevents them from comparison
shopping.1,10,11 Little is known, however, about the national
variation in markups on ED services and how they may differ
fromthoseinotherhospitaldepartments.Inthisstudy,weused
physician payment data from the Centers for Medicare & Med-
icaid Services to study the variation in markups on ED profes-
sional services and in relation to markups in internal medi-
cine. We also examined the association between the level of
markup and the characteristics of the hospitals and their pa-
tient populations.
Methods
We compared physician charges with what the Medicare pro-
gram would pay emergency medicine physicians for the same
service (ie, the level of excess charges, or markup). We then
aggregated the physicians by their primary hospital affilia-
tions and analyzed the markups on ED services at the hospi-
tal level and relative to markups on internal medicine ser-
vices. Finally, we analyzed the factors associated with ED and
internal medicine markups using multivariable linear regres-
sion models that included characteristics of the hospitals and
their patient populations. This study was exempted by the
Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board as not being hu-
man subjects research.
Data Sets
We used the 2013 Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment
Data: Physician and Other Supplier, which includes claims for
all services that physicians performed for Medicare Part B fee-
for-servicebeneficiaries.12Forpatientprivacyreasons,thedata
set excluded services provided to fewer than 10 beneficiaries
by a single physician. We included claims billed by emer-
gency medicine and internal medicine physicians in a hospi-
tal facility and excluded services performed in an office set-
ting.ClaimswerelinkedusingtheNationalPhysicianIdentifier
to the Physician Compare database to identify each physi-
cian’s primary hospital affiliation.13 The 2013 American Hos-
pital Association database (https://www.ahadataviewer.com
/additional-data-products/AHA-Survey) was used to identify
thecharacteristicsoftheEDs,includingsize,urban/ruralstatus,
teaching status, for-profit status, regional location, and safety-
net hospital status. Safety-net hospitals included all public
hospitals,aswellasprivatehospitalswithaMedicaidutilization
rate,definedasMedicaidhospitaldaysdividedbytotalhospital
days, greater than 1 SD above the mean rate in its state.14,15
Lastly, we estimated the prevalence of poverty, uninsured
status, and minority populations in the zip code where each
hospital is located, using data from the 2013 American
Community Survey (US Census Bureau; https://www.census
.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html).
Markup Ratios
We assessed the level of excess charges using markup ratios,
which is the ratio of the billed charges to the Medicare allow-
able amount. For example, a markup ratio of 3.5 means that
for a service with a $100 Medicare-allowable amount, the hos-
pital charges $350, or 250% in excess charges. This approach
is consistent with previous literature using Medicare pay-
ment rates as a benchmark to compare charges across special-
tiesandregions.16,17TheMedicare-allowableamountisthesum
ofwhatMedicarepays,thedeductibleandcoinsuranceamount
that the beneficiary is responsible for paying, and any amount
that a third party is responsible for paying.13 Consistent with
previous work, we assumed that these charges are the maxi-
mum potential amounts billed to uninsured and out-of-
network patients.16

cedures performed by other medical specialties. The Medi-
care Provider Utilization and Payment Data lists charges billed
to Medicare by each physician as well as the Medicare-
allowable amount for each Healthcare Common Procedure
Coding System (HCPCS) code.12 Charges and Medicare-
allowable amounts for each physician have been adjusted for
modifiers that in some instances indicate a higher or lower in-
tensity or complexity of service.12 We excluded HCPCS codes
describing services provided by emergency medicine physi-
cians outside the ED setting, including those from inpatient
care and office visits. For emergency medicine and internal
medicine, we defined each hospital’s markup ratio as the
Key Points
Question How do emergency departments set chargemaster
prices for services, and how do these practices affect patients?
Findings In this analysis of Medicare billing records from 2707 US
hospitals in 2013, different emergency departments charged
between 1.0 and 12.6 times what Medicare paid for the services.
Excess charges, or “markups,” on specific services were greater
when performed by an emergency medicine physician compared
with an internal medicine physician.
Meaning Further legislation is needed to protect uninsured and
out-of-network patients from excess charges in the emergency
department.

 aggregated physician professional fee charges submitted to
Medicare divided by the aggregated Medicare-allowable
amounts in 2013.
Statistical Analysis
We analyzed the variation in markup ratios for all ED and in-
ternal medicine services and individual HCPCS codes at the
hospital level, focusing on the services with the greatest na-
tional total Medicare-allowable amounts. The most common
ED services included levels 1 to 5 evaluation and manage-
mentcodesforclinicalevaluationanddecisionmaking(HCPCS
codes 99281-99285); common procedures performed by emer-
gency medicine physicians, including wound care (code
97597), laceration repair (codes 12001-12002), management
and supervision of oxygen chamber therapy (code 99183), de-
bridement (codes 11042, 11043, 11045, and 15271), critical care
(codes 99291-99292), intubation (code 31500), insertion of an
intravenous catheter (code 36556), and cardiopulmonary re-
suscitation (code 92950); and emergency medicine physi-
cian professional fees for interpreting studies performed by
otherphysicians,includingchestradiographs(codes71010and
71020),electrocardiograms(codes93010and93042),andcom-
puted tomographic scans of the head (code 70450). For com-
mon ED services also performed by internal medicine physi-
cians in other hospital settings, we performed a direct
comparison of markups in hospitals that billed from both
departments.
We performed multivariable linear regression analysis to
study the association between the ED markup ratios and char-
acteristics of the hospitals and their patient populations. A 1-U
increase in the ED markup ratio means that, for every $100 in
Medicare-allowable amount billed, the ED charged an addi-
tional$100.DataanalysiswasconductedfromJanuary1toJuly
31, 2016. All analyses were performed using Stata, version 13.1
(StataCorp).
Results
We identified 12 337 emergency medicine physicians affili-
ated with 2707 EDs and 57 607 internal medicine physicians
affiliated with 3669 hospitals in all 50 states that billed for
Medicare Part B services in 2013. The characteristics of the EDs
were similar to those of hospitals billing internal medicine ser-
vices in the United States: 49.5% were located within urban
hospitals, 34.6% were in teaching hospitals, 18.2% were for-
profitinstitutions,and59.3%wereinhospitalswithfewerthan
200 beds (Table 1). Approximately 1 in 4 (22.9%) EDs was lo-
cated in a zip code in which more than 20% of the population
was uninsured.
Nationwide, services provided by emergency medicine
physicians to Medicare Part B fee-for-service beneficiaries to-
taled $4 billion in charges and $898 million in Medicare-
allowableamounts,representinganoverallmarkupratioof4.4
(340% excess charges). By contrast, the overall markup ratio
for all services provided by internal medicine physicians was
2.1 (110% excess charges). Markup ratios for common ED ser-
vices varied widely by procedure code and hospital (Table 2).
Among the evaluation and management codes, which ac-
counted for the majority of professional fees paid to emer-
gency medicine physicians, the median markup by hospital for
level 1 to 5 visits varied from 4.0 to 5.0. Laceration repair had
the highest median markup ratio (median by hospital, 7.0;
range, 2.0-15.0), and interpretation of a computed tomo-
graphic scan of the head had the greatest interhospital varia-
tion,rangingbetween1.6and27.7.MarkupratiosintheEDwere
generally higher than those in internal medicine for common
services performed in both departments (Table 3).
By hospital, the aggregated markup ratio for all ED ser-
vices ranged from 1.0 to 12.6 (median, 4.2; interquartile range
[IQR],3.3-5.8);theaggregatedmarkupratioforallinternalmedi-
cine services ranged from 1.0 to 14.1 (median, 2.0; IQR, 1.7-2.5)
(Figure1).GreaterEDmarkupratiosbyhospital(n = 2707)were
associated with for-profit status (median, 5.7; IQR, 4.0-7.1),
greater uninsured population (median, 5.0; IQR, 3.5-6.7; ≥20%
uninsured),AfricanAmerican(median,5.0;IQR,3.5-6.8;≥20%
African American) and Hispanic (median, 4.4; IQR, 3.5-6.2;
≥20% Hispanic) patient populations, and location in the south-
eastern United States (median, 5.3; IQR, 3.8-6.8) (Figure 2 and
eTable in the Supplement). These associations between mark-
ups and hospital characteristics were not present for internal
medicine services.
Discussion
In this national study of hospital pricing practices in 2013, we
found wide variation in excess charges for ED services rela-
tive to what Medicare would have paid. Moreover, ED ser-
vices were generally priced higher than those in the internal

 medicine department for the same services within a given hos-
pital. Emergency departments with the greatest markups were
more likely to be for-profit and serve larger uninsured popu-
lations. These findings reinforce the recent interest among
states in protecting patients from excess medical charges.
In considering all ED services, for every $100 in Medicare-
allowable amounts, different hospitals charged patients
between$100(markupratio,1.0)and$1260(markupratio,12.6),
with a median of $420 (markup ratio, 4.2); in contrast, the
median hospital’s internal medicine charge would have been
$200 (markup ratio, 2.0). The variation in markup on specific
ED services was in many instances greater. For physician inter-
pretationofelectrocardiograms,whichhadamedianMedicare-
allowable amount of $16, different EDs charged between $18
(markup ratio, 1.1) and $317 (markup ratio, 20.0), with a me-
dian of $95 (markup ratio, 6.0). Our results are consistent with
those of previous studies showing wide variation in ED charges
by hospital for similar conditions and levels of visits.1,18
We also found that, within a hospital, common ED ser-
vices were generally priced higher than the same services in
the internal medicine department. For example, the median
hospital charged an additional $34 for interpreting an electro-
cardiogram when performed by an emergency medicine phy-
sician ($96; markup ratio, 6.0) relative to an internal medi-
cine physician ($62; markup ratio, 3.9). Our findings are
consistentwithpreviousresearchsuggestingthathospitalsmay
set chargemaster prices strategically across departments to in-
crease revenues.2,16 In our study, for-profit hospitals and hos-
pitals serving larger uninsured populations charged higher
amounts in their EDs, but this was not the case for internal
medicine services. Markups in the ED may represent cost-
shiftingtocoverexpendituresonuncompensatedcare.1Atleast
7 states, including California, have passed legislation to pro-
tecttheuninsuredagainsthavingtopaychargemasterprices.19
For example, the 2006 Hospital Fair Pricing Act mandated that
hospitals limit the charges to the low-income uninsured to
Medicare-allowable amounts,20 resulting in a two-thirds re-
duction in the collection rate among the uninsured between
2004 and 2012.19
In addition to uninsured patients, insured but out-of-
network patients can become subject to chargemaster prices.3
In the course of negotiations between insurers and physi-
cians over payment rates, patients of physicians who remain
out of network may receive a balance bill for the difference be-
tween the chargemaster price and the amount paid by the
insurer.21 Out-of-network care can also result from hospitals
outsourcing ED and other physician services to private con-
tractors who are not part of the hospital’s insurer network.21
Recent studies suggest that as many as 22% of ED visits at an
in-network hospital may include services from an out-of-
network physician, creating potential balance bills in each
case.17,22 Given that patients have little opportunity to com-
parison shop for ED services, the variation in excess charges
across hospitals is especially problematic.

 Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires health
plans to cover out-of-network ED visits with similar percent-
ages of cost sharing to in-network care, there remains no
national legislation that addresses the issue of balance bills.23
However, in at least 15 states, legislation with varying levels
of breadth and depth have attempted to protect patients
from these “surprise medical bills.
”23 Proposed or passed leg-
islative actions include requiring hospitals and insurers to
disclose out-of-network status prior to care, compelling
insurance companies to pay the full balance bill, setting a
“usual and customary” rate determined by analyses of previ-
ous payments or employing state-led mediation, and banning
balance billing altogether.23,24 New York’s 2015 “Emergency
Medical Services and Surprise Bills” law further requires that
hospitals negotiate directly with the insurer for all out-of-
network payments, thus holding the patient harmless from
surprise medical bills.25 A second feature that distinguishes
the New York law is that it protects patients against balance
bills in all settings—not just in the ED.24,25 Legislation may
also be most protective against surprise medical bills from

encymaybemostusefulfor“shoppable”electiveservices,such
as colonoscopies.26 Another proposed approach would cap all
charges at 125% of the Medicare-allowable amount to elimi-
nate extreme charge variation.27 This form of price regula-
tion, however, has the potential to alter the market dynamics
of insurance network negotiations if applied to out-of-
network patients. A third proposal would require hospitals to
sell a bundled ED care package that includes all professional
and facility fees and therefore maintain a pool of employees
and contracted physicians who agree to accept reasonable pay-
ment rates a priori.17
Limitations
Our findings should be considered in the context of some im-
portant limitations. First, we derived our markup ratios from
the physician professional fees, which do not include facility
and technical fees also charged by the hospital. Second, data
on patients’ insurance type or the amount actually paid by the
patients were unavailable. In some cases, uninsured and out-
of-network patients may have negotiated with the hospital to
pay less than the billed charges. A 2011 survey of 721 privately
insured adults found that 14% of patients negotiated their out-
of-network bills with hospitals and physicians and were suc-
cessful about half the time.28 These findings support the need
to increase patient awareness and enact further protections.
Third, we identified ED services based on the physician’s spe-
cialty as collected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services. In some cases, physicians whose primary specialty
is internal medicine may have provided services in the ED.
However, internal medicine physicians who performed ser-
vices in the ED would have caused a regression toward the
mean and underestimated the differences between the 2
specialties when ED markups exceeded internal medicine
markups. Finally, we used United States Census data to esti-
mate the uninsured and minority populations in each hospi-
tal’s zip code, which may not be representative of the
patients who presented to the hospital.
Conclusions
Using national Medicare payment data, our study demon-
strates the wide variation in the prices EDs charge patients
for medical services, which can vary between 1.0 and 12.6
times the Medicare-allowable amount by hospital. Moreover,
we found that hospitals typically charge patients more for
similar services when performed by an ED physician com-
pared with an internal medicine physician. In this context,
the ongoing trends of uninsurance, hospital consolidation,
and narrowing insurance networks since implementation of
the Affordable Care Act are poised to increase the potential
for patient financial harm in the years to come.29-31 Now,
more than ever, protecting uninsured and out-of-network
patients from highly variable hospital pricing should be a
policy priority.
