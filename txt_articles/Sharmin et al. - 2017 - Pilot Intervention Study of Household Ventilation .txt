Abstract.
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a risk factor for pneumonia; ventilation may be protective. We tested
behavioral and structural ventilation interventions on indoor PM2.5 inDhaka, Bangladesh. We recruited 59good ventilation
(window or door in ³ 3 walls) and 29 poor ventilation (no window, one door) homes. We monitored baseline indoor and
outdoor PM2.5 for 48 hours. We asked all participants to increase ventilation behavior, including opening windows and
doors, and operating fans. Where permitted, we installed windows in nine poor ventilation homes, then repeated PM2.5
monitoring. We estimated effects using linear mixed-effects models and conducted qualitative interviews regarding
motivators and barriers to ventilation. Compared with poor ventilation homes, good ventilation homes were larger, their
residents wealthier and less likely to use biomass fuel. In multivariable linear mixed-effects models, ventilation structures
and opening a door or window were inversely associated with the number of hours PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 100
and 250 μg/m3. Outdoor air pollution was positively associated with the number of hours PM2.5 concentrations exceeded
100 and 250 μg/m3. Few homes accepted window installation, due to landlord refusal and fear of theft. Motivators for
ventilation behavior included cooling of the home and sunlight; barriers included rain, outdoor odors or noise, theft risk,
mosquito entry, and, for fan use, perceptions of wasting electricity or unavailability of electricity. We concluded that
ventilation may reduce indoor PM2.5 concentrations but, there are barriers to increasing ventilation and, in areas with high
ambient PM2.5 concentrations, indoor concentrations may remain above recommended levels.
INTRODUCTION
Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) are the leading
cause of death among children under 5 years old in Bangla-
desh.1 Exposure to indoor air pollution, especially to fine
particulate matter (PM2.5), has been implicated as a risk factor
for pneumonia and other respiratory diseases in children.2,3
The use of biomass cooking fuel, in particular, has often been
cited as a major source of PM2.5.2 Other factors, such as
outdoor air pollution4–6 and tobacco smoking,7,8 may con-
tribute to indoor air pollution in Bangladesh. In Kamalapur, a
low-income area in the capital city of Dhaka, the burden of
pneumonia is high, at approximately 0.56 episodes per child-
year in children under 2 years old,9 despite estimates that only
10% of the Kamalapur population use biomass fuel for
cooking.10
Lack of ventilation and inadequate air flow have been
identified as risk factors for transmission of respiratory path-
ogens in hospitals, schools, and other public buildings.11,12
Many health-care facilities in high-income countries have
sophisticated ventilation systems to prevent transmission of
infectious diseases,12 but such technologies are typically not
available in low-income areas. However, there is evidence that
even simple household ventilation may decrease suscepti-
bility to ALRI. In a recent case–control study of environmental
risk factors for pneumonia in Kamalapur, those who had
cross-ventilation in the home, defined as the presence of
windows and/or doors in opposing walls, were 28% less likely
to have pneumonia compared with those who did not have
cross-ventilation in the home.10 Similarly, in a cohort study in
Kamalapur, having at least two windows in a home was asso-
ciated with a 25% reduction in ALRI risk and not owning an
electric fan was associated with a 50% increase in ALRI risk.13
Household ventilation may reduce the risk of respiratory infec-
tions directly by facilitating clearance of pathogens,11,12,14 in-
directly by reducing particulate matter concentrations and thus
pulmonary susceptibility to infection,4–6,15–18 or both. Particu-
late matter may contain pathogens, so the effects of ventilation
on particulate matter may also affect pathogen clearance.12
In the aforementioned case–control study in Kamalapur,
households with cross-ventilation (windows or doors on op-
posing walls) were shown to have significantly lower mean
PM2.5 concentrations than those without cross-ventilation.15
Additional observational studies have described the effects of
ventilation on the relationships between biomass fuel use,5,18
stove type,17,19 and season4 with indoor PM2.5 concentra-
tions, but did not directly assess the effects of ventilation on
PM2.5 concentrations.
The existing literature lacks experimental designs that di-
rectly test the impact of pragmatic interventions to increase
household ventilation on indoor air pollution in low-income
settings. Similarly, we have identified only one study that ex-
amines acceptability and feasibility of such ventilation inter-
ventions in a low-income setting.20 This study, set in South
Africa, found that improving ventilation behavior was feasible
during favorable weather, but repairing ventilation structure
was too costly. We hypothesized that a pragmatic intervention
to increase ventilation in the household would reduce con-
centrations of fine PM2.5 in Kamalapur households, where
indoor PM2.5 concentrations are high although few people rely
on biomass fuel use. Additionally, we hypothesized that such
interventions would be widely acceptable and feasible. Finally,
we sought to identify motivators and barriers to adherence to a
ventilation intervention in Kamalapur.

 In this pilot study, we used quantitative and qualitative
methods to test an intervention to improve ventilation struc-
ture, the number of windows in a household, as well as to
increase ventilation behavior, specifically, opening doors and
windows and turning fans on, at no cost to the participant. We
aimed to 1) describe the relationships between existing ven-
tilation structure and behaviors and PM2.5 concentrations,
2) determine the effect of household behavioral and structural
interventions to increase ventilation on indoor PM2.5 con-
centrations, and 3) describe the feasibility and acceptability
of behavioral and structural ventilation interventions in
Kamalapur, a low-income urban area of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population. In July and August 2011, study staff
recruited participants from among the control arm of a
2009–2010 case–control study on factors associated with
acute respiratory infections in children less than 5 years old in
Kamalapur.10 Participants in the control arm were randomly
selected from the general population undergoing syndromic
surveillance, frequency matched to enrolled cases by age
group.10,21 All data collection for the ventilation study took
place during July and August 2011, the hot and rainy season in
Bangladesh.
Sampling procedure. We recruited households of control
children based on structural ventilation status (poor or good)
as observed in the case–control study. Specifically, house-
holds were described as having poor ventilation structure if
they had no windows and only one external door, or described
as having good ventilation structure if they had an external
window and/or door in at least three walls. We selected po-
tential participants whose houses fit the poor ventilation and
good ventilation categories based on data collected for the
earlier case–control study, with the intent to enroll a 1:1 ratio of
poor ventilation to good ventilation households. As this study
was intended as a small-scale pilot study primarily to assess
feasibility, we did not formally model a quantitative hypothesis
to calculate statistical power and sample size. Based on
budgetary and logistical considerations, we sought to recruit
90 participants in total.
Eligibility criteria. We sought to recruit the primary care-
givers of the children who participated in the case–control
study. Participants were eligible if they intended to reside in
their houses for the subsequent 4 weeks, if no members of
their household had respiratory illness at the time of enroll-
ment, and if they did not cook inside their main living space. It
is customary in Kamalapur for residents of several neighboring
homes to share a central cooking space, adjacent to or apart
from any of the living spaces. We limited our sample to those
who did not cook in their main living space, since cooking is
widely recognized to affect indoor air pollution.22 If one or
more household members had respiratory illness at the time of
the initial visit, we returned 2 weeks later and, if the illness was
resolved, we attempted to recruit the household. Each eligible
participant was enrolled only after written consent was
obtained. All study procedures were approved by the in-
stitutional review boards at the International Center for Di-
arrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b; Dhaka,
Bangladesh) and the University at Buffalo (Buffalo, NY).
Baseline data collection. Study staff interviewed con-
senting participants and observed household environments to
obtain information on demographic factors and factors po-
tentially related to indoor PM2.5 concentrations such as
cooking practices, fuel use, crowding, building material of the
home, and smoking inside the home. We asked all participants
to name the approximate price for installation of a new window
in their home and whether they considered that price to be
affordable. We conducted measurements in the child’s
sleeping space to approximate the child’s exposure to indoor
air pollution. We measured the dimensions of the child’s
sleeping space and cooking space using a measuring tape
and the distance from the stove to the child’s sleeping space in
steps.
We measured baseline PM2.5 concentrations inside and
outside the home for 48 consecutive hours using UCB particle
monitors (Berkeley Air Monitoring Group, Berkeley, CA). We
chose to use these devices due to availability and budget
considerations. These devices have been validated in settings
with high indoor PM2.5 concentrations, such as Kamalapur.23
Because children are at elevated risk of respiratory disease
from high indoor PM2.5 concentrations,3,24 we placed one
monitor inside the home above the study child’s sleeping
space, 145 cm from the ground. A second monitor was placed
outside, directly above the main entrance of the home. During
these 48 hours of baseline PM2.5 measurement, we asked
participants to keep a log, recording the following information
hourly when they were awake and at home: whether doors and
windows were opened or closed, whether fans were on or off,
and whether electricity was currently available in their homes.
Since sunlight in a home is related to ventilation structure and
ultraviolet light may prevent pathogen survival,25 we mea-
sured the amount of luminance from sunlight (in lux units) at
the locations of indoor and outdoor monitors. We took two
measurements each at the time of placement and removal,
using a digital lux meter, LX1010B.
Intervention. The intervention consisted of a behavioral
component and a structural component. After baseline PM2.5
monitoring, we implemented the behavioral component
among all participants in both good and poor ventilation
households: specifically, we encouraged participants to keep
windows and doors open and to keep a fan on for as many
hours per day as possible (Figure 1). If a participant did not
have a working fan, we provided one. We chose window and
door opening and fan use as behavioral targets, as they have
been shown to be associated with reduced ALRI.13,26 We
asked for these behavioral changes to continue for 1 week.
Those who lived in poor ventilation households were also
eligible for the structural component of the intervention: in-
stallation of a new window in the home. We asked the par-
ticipants and, where applicable, their landlords for permission
to install the window. In the poor ventilation houses in which it
was physically feasible to install a new window and for which
we had received verbal permission from both the participant
and the landlord, a local contractor installed new windows. We
did not pre-specify size and location of the new windows;
rather, local contractors and participants worked together to
determine the best size and location of new windows, based
on existing household structure. For households that received
a structural intervention, the behavioral intervention was in-
troduced immediately after installation of the new window. For
homes that did not receive a structural intervention, the be-
havioral intervention was introduced immediately after base-
line PM2.5 monitoring.

 Intervention data collection. During the week of the be-
havioral intervention, we monitored PM2.5 concentrations
again for 48 hours by placing air quality monitors in the same
locations as for the baseline monitoring. We did not specify the
exact date of follow-up data collection to allow some flexibility
in data collectors’ and participants’ schedules and to prevent
data collection on Fridays (the Muslim holy day, when daily
activities might change). During these 48 hours, we again
asked participants to keep a log of whether doors and win-
dows were opened or closed, fans were on or off, and whether
electricity was available in their houses or not for each hour.
We again measured the amount of sunlight at the same lo-
cations at the time of monitor placement and removal. After
the week of behavioral intervention, we administered a brief
end line questionnaire, querying factors associated with air
pollution in the household that may have changed between
the time of baseline and end line. These factors included
cooking practices, fuel use, and smoking inside the house.
Qualitative data collection. After completion of quantita-
tive data collection, we conducted qualitative in-depth inter-
views
with
participants
who
lived
in good
ventilation
households, poor ventilation households who received a
structural intervention, and poor ventilation households who
refused a structural intervention. We selected respondents
purposively from the list of participants under each of those
three categories. In in-depth interviews, we asked for feed-
back regarding acceptability of increasing ventilation, moti-
vators and barriers to doing so, and seasonal variation in
household ventilation behavior. We recorded all in-depth in-
terviews using a digital audio recorder and later transcribed
them verbatim in Bengali.
Analysis. To analyze quantitative data, we first reported
descriptive characteristics of good ventilation and poor venti-
lation homes. Ventilation status was characterized as 1) poor
ventilation households without window installation, 2) poor
ventilation households withwindowinstallation, or3)goodven-
tilation households. We conducted a subgroup analysis to
describe any descriptive differences between poor ventilation
homes that did and did not receive a structural intervention.
Then, we described ventilation behavior at baseline and during
intervention, as well as PM2.5 concentrations for all three ven-
tilation status groups and for indoor (above child’s sleeping
space) and outdoor (immediately outside the home) monitors.
The lower limit of detection of the University of California,
Berkeley air quality monitors is relatively high, 50 mg/m3, which
is twice the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended
24-hour mean PM2.5 concentration.3,4,23,27–29 It is therefore
difficult to accurately estimate mean PM2.5 concentrations
using these monitors. Ezzati and others demonstrated that
duration of exposureto high PMconcentrations isimportant to
acute respiratory infection risk.30 Prior work in Dhaka demon-
strated an association between the number of hours PM2.5
concentrations exceeded 100 mg/m3 measured using the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley air quality monitors and risk of
ALRI among infants3 and age at first ALRI.3,24 Therefore, we
calculated the number of hours during the 48-hour monitoring
period that indoor PM2.5 concentrations exceeded predefined
thresholds of 100 and 250 mg/m3. We chose to use 100 and
250 mg/m3 because they represent four and ten times the WHO
standard of 25 mg/m3, and to make our results comparable to
similar studies that used the number of hours PM2.5 exceeded
100 and 250 mg/m3 in highly polluted environments.3,4,10,24

INTERVENTION STUDY OF HOUSEHOLD VENTILATION AND PM2.5
617
 This study was conducted near the end of the rainy season
in Bangladesh, when there are daily variations in the amount of
cloud cover and, thus, outdoor sunlight. To account for the
varying amounts of outdoor sunlight during our study period,
we calculated the ratio of indoor to outdoor sunlight. We cal-
culated the average ratio of indoor to outdoor sunlight for each
home at baseline and at follow-up, and reported the median
ratio of indoor to outdoor sunlight for the sample by in-
tervention status.
Since we measured PM2.5 concentrations at baseline and
follow-up for each home, we assessed the effects of ventila-
tion behavior and structure on indoor PM2.5 concentrations
using mixed-effect linear regression, accounting for repeated
subjects. We tested each of the following independent vari-
ables in separate linear regression models: ventilation status,
area of windows and doors in the home, number of hours that
windows were open, number of hours that doors were open,
number of hours that fans were on, and number of hours
outdoor PM2.5 concentrations exceed 100 and 250 mg/m3. We
calculated the number of hours that doors and windows were
open by using door-hours and window-hours (one window
being open for 2 hours is equivalent to two window-hours, as
are two windows being open for 1 hour). Dependent variables
included number of hours that indoor PM2.5 concentrations
exceeded 100 and 250 mg/m3.
Our final models estimated the effects of behavioral and
structural interventions on number of hours PM2.5 concen-
tration exceeded previously specified thresholds (100 and
250 mg/m3), after adjusting for covariates and accounting for
repeated measures of ventilation behavior and PM2.5 con-
centrations. Covariates were chosen for inclusion in the final
models if they changed the estimate of association between
ventilation factors and number of hours PM2.5 concentrations
exceeded 100 and 250 mg/m3 by at least 10% and were not
strongly collinear with other covariates in the model. Cate-
gorical covariates must have been present in some poor and
some good ventilation homes to be considered for inclusion in
final
models.
Covariates
tested
included
measures
of
crowding, cooking fuels, smoking in the home, physical at-
tributes of the home and cooking space, outdoor air pollution,
and wealth status. We ranked households according to wealth
status using principal component analysis of household
assets.31
To address the feasibility of structural interventions, we first
described the proportion of poor ventilation households for
whom both occupants and owners agreed to a new window
installation and reasons for refusal for those who refused,
gathered during qualitative in-depth interviews. We then re-
ported descriptive statistics for reported estimated cost of
window installation. To assess the feasibility of behavioral
interventions, whether participants were able to increase
ventilation behaviors, we described the reported number of
hours that doors and windows were open, a fan was on, and
electricity was available at baseline and during the intervention
period. We compared the differences in ventilation behavior at
baseline compared with the intervention period separately for
all three ventilation status groups.
To analyze the qualitative data, we developed a code
list according to study objectives and based on themes
that emerged from the collected data. Then, we coded all
the responses and performed content analysis according
to the major themes, which included motivators and
barriers to practicing ventilation behavior offered during
the intervention.32
RESULTS
We recruited 29 poor ventilation and 59 good ventilation
households for this study. We were unable to locate many of
the potential poor ventilation participants who had taken part
in the 2009–2010 case–control study because they had
moved. Thus, we enrolled a 1:2 ratio of poor to good ventila-
tion households. We were able to install new windows in 9 of
the 29 poor ventilation households. All respondents were fe-
male. Compared with participants living in poor ventilation
households, participants living in good ventilation households
were wealthier, more educated, more likely to own their house,
more likely report paying for electricity, and more likely to
exclusively use improved cooking fuels (Table 1). Their houses
were larger, had fewer people per sleeping room, and were all
constructed of concrete, brick, or mud, whereas tin and
bamboo thatch were also used in poor ventilation houses.
There were no significant differences between poor and good
ventilation households with respect to age of respondent,
distance between stove and cooking space, and smoking
inside the house. Likewise, we did not observe statistically
significant differences between descriptive characteristics of
respondents in poor ventilation homes that did not receive a
structural intervention and those who did, possibly a function
of small sample size. Those who did not receive a structural
intervention were slightly younger (mean age 28.6 years) than
those in homes that received a structural intervention (mean
age 32.8 years, P = 0.4) and were more likely to have at least
one concrete or brick wall (40% compared with 11%, P = 0.2),
but the two groups did not differ in any other descriptive
characteristic (results not shown).
At baseline, all participants reported high levels of ventila-
tion behavior during the hot and rainy season. Among poor
ventilation households, doors were opened for an average of
more than 13 hours per day and fans were on for an average of
more than 16 hours per day. Participants in good ventilation
households reported that windows and doors were open and
fans were on for an average of more than 18 hours per day
(Table 2). At follow-up (median of 7 days after baseline), par-
ticipants did not significantly increase the number of hours
that their doors were opened. Among good ventilation
households, participantsopened their windows for anaverage
of nearly two hours more at follow-up compared with baseline
(P = 0.1). Fan use was significantly lower at follow-up com-
pared with baseline among all ventilation groups, likely
due to decreases in availability of electricity as reported by
participants.
PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 100 and 250 mg/m3 for
longer at follow-up compared with baseline for poor ventila-
tion households and outdoor monitors, but these differences
were not statistically significant (Table 3). At follow-up, PM2.5
concentrations exceeded 100 and 250 mg/m3 for the longest
time among poor ventilation households with no structural
intervention. During 48 hours of monitoring at baseline, PM2.5
concentrations exceeded 100 (P = 0.006) and 250 mg/m3
(P = 0.02) in poor ventilation homes for approximately twice
as long compared with good ventilation homes.
At baseline, the median amount of sunlight in poor ventila-
tion homes that did not receive a structural intervention was
618
WEAVER AND OTHERS
 0.4% that of outdoor sunlight (interquartile range [IQR] 2.7%)
and, at follow-up, was 0.3% that of outdoor sunlight (IQR
2.7%). The median amount of sunlight in poor ventilation
households that received a structural intervention was 0.7%
that of outdoor sunlight at baseline (IQR 1.5%) and was 1% of
outdoor light (IQR 6.0%) at follow-up. At baseline, the median
amount of sunlight in good ventilation homes was 7.7% of
outdoor sunlight (IQR 19.0%) and was 6.8% that of outdoor
sunlight (IQR 17.2%) at follow-up.
Because we had a small sample size and few results were
statistically significant, we report on associations with a sub-
stantial effect size (³ 1 hour difference in time PM2.5 concen-
tration exceeded threshold), as well as those that were
statistically significant at P < 0.05. We presented bivariate and

INTERVENTION STUDY OF HOUSEHOLD VENTILATION AND PM2.5

 adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models, accounting
for repeated measures. Adjusted models included variables
coding for distance from stove to sleeping space, outdoor air
pollution, and use of biomass cooking fuels; we examined
each indicator of ventilation in separate models due to col-
linearity among the ventilation indicators (Table 4). Although
smoking has been demonstrated to be a source of PM2.5 in
other contexts, it was not a significant predictor of PM2.5 in this
study. After adjustment, homes with good ventilation status
had 4.4 fewer hours during which PM2.5 concentrations
exceeded 100 mg/m3 (P = 0.001) and 3.0 fewer hours during
which PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 250 mg/m3 (P = 0.004)
compared with those with poor ventilation status that did not
receive a structural intervention. Poor ventilation homes that
received a structural intervention had 1.6 fewer hours during
which PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 100 mg/m3 (P = 0.5) and
2.4 fewer hours during which PM2.5 concentrations exceeded
250 mg/m3 (P = 0.1) compared with homes with poor ventila-
tion status that did not receive a structural intervention. Area of
windows and doors, window-hours, and door-hours of ven-
tilation were inversely associated with the number of hours
PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 100 and 250 mg/m3. We did
not observe an association between number of hours a
fan was on and number of hours PM2.5 exceeded 100 or
250 mg/m3. The number of hours outdoor PM2.5 concentra-
tions exceeded 100 and 250 mg/m3 was positively associated
with the number of hours indoor PM2.5 concentrations
exceeded 100 (P = 0.06) and 250 mg/m3 (P = 0.1).
We conducted in-depth interviews with 16 participants from
all three ventilation status categories. Seven of eight respon-
dents in the good ventilation household group reported that
their usual practice is to open their doors and windows from
morning until evening during the hot summer months when-
ever they are at home. They practiced these ventilation be-
haviors to get more sunlight or fresh air inside the room during
the day. Respondents also reported seasonal variation of
usual ventilation behaviors. Although most respondents re-
ported closing their windows more often during winter due to
cool or foggy weather or to prevent mosquito entry, a few
(N = 3) reported practicing the same ventilation behaviors in
winter as they do in summer to have adequate sunlight in their
homes during winter. According to the respondents, since
they had already been practicing these ventilation behaviors,
they did not change much during the intervention period. The
only added practice for the respondents from poor ventilation
households (N = 4) who received a structural intervention was
to keep the window open most of the time. These respondents
also indicated their ability to open a newly installed window as

WEAVER AND OTHERS
 a motivator. They considered this new window as an alterna-
tive to a fan, especially when electricity is unavailable. Addi-
tional benefits include increased natural light and cool air in
their room. One respondent who received a structural in-
tervention stated
If we felt hot in this room, we used to go outside.
Now we do not go; we do stay in this room. . . . .the
window is always open. . . . (we) feel cool here (in the
room). . .Air comes through the window, that’s why
we can sit down here.
Although, during the intervention period, many respon-
dents tried to open their doors and windows as much as
possible during the day compared with their usual practices,
they reported closing their doors and windows after dusk to
prevent mosquito entry, block outside noise or street lights,
sudden rain, and while sleeping for fear of theft or anticipa-
tion of rain at night. The majority of respondents from all three
categories reported some common explanations for turning
off their fans: during cooking to avoid the pungent smell of
cooking smoke or heat inside the room, during evening,
when sweeping the room, when children were outside or
going to school and no one was available in the room, in
cloudy weather, during rain, or if the temperature was rela-
tively cool. However, the most commonly reported barriers to
operating fans were sporadic power outages, perceptions of
wasting electricity, and landlords requesting respondents to
turn off fans. Although many participants do not report
paying for electricity, they perceived that turning a fan on in
an empty room is a waste of electricity. Some respondents
also reported that turning on fans for a long time could make
the room hotter, and leaving the fan on was believed to re-
duce the longevity of the fan. Only in a few cases (good
ventilation households), where respondents reported not
being concerned about high electricity bills or theft, were
they able to practice this intervention ventilation behavior
entirely.
Respondents from poor ventilation households without a
window (N = 4) said that they did not make any change to their
regular ventilation practice during intervention. One re-
spondent in this group considered the advantage of not in-
stalling a window in her household to avoid theft, but also
mentioned that it takes some time to cool her home in the
absence of a window.
The four participants living in poor ventilation households
with no structural intervention who participated in qualitative
interviews reported that their landlords would not allow win-
dow construction. One participant reported that a window
would look odd in her low ceiling one-room house with a lack
of physical space. There was a general concern that a window
would place households at risk for theft.
Only 40 of the 88 participants were able to estimate a price
for installation of a new window; other participants reported
not knowing how much window installation costs. The median
price mentioned (in USD) was $33.56, with a range of
$3.23–$192.75 and a mode of $12.84. Of these 40 partici-
pants, 22 (55%) believed this perceived price to be affordable.
The actual price of window installation varied by the building
material of the house’s walls, but ranged from $9.68 to $15.49.
Thirty-one (78%) of these 40 participants believed the quoted
price to be affordable.
DISCUSSION
In this pilot study of pragmatic behavioral and structural
ventilation interventions, having good household ventilation
(doors or windows in at least three walls compared with no
windows and one door) was associated with shorter duration
of high PM2.5 concentrations in a home. We observed po-
tential associations between installation of a new window in
homes that previously had no window and area of doors and
windows in a home with a shorter duration of high PM2.5
concentrations. However, likely due to our small sample size,
these associations were not statistically significant. Good
ventilation homes had more natural light compared with poor
ventilation homes; installation of a window did not sub-
stantially increase the amount of light in a home. The amount
of time doors and windows were open and outdoor PM2.5
concentrations had a small effect on duration of high PM2.5
concentrations. These results are consistent with the existing
literature on structural ventilation and air quality.17,18 Although
we did not assess health outcomes in this study, PM2.5 ex-
posure is a known risk factor for childhood ALRI and other
diseases.2,3,33–35 Because of its association with PM2.5, we
believe household ventilation may be beneficial to health, but
the extent to which improving ventilation may improve child-
hood health is not clear from this study.
Households with good ventilation status had shorter dura-
tions of high PM2.5 concentrations compared with those with
poor ventilation status at baseline and follow-up. This is likely
to be at least partially due to the increased area of windows
and doors. Additionally, there may be other differences be-
tween poor and good ventilation homes that may affect air
quality. Compared with poor ventilation homes, good venti-
lation homes were larger in volume, more likely to be made of
concrete, and less likely to use biomass fuel for cooking, all of
which have been shown to affect air quality in other
studies.5,6,36 We were unable to adjust for volume and building
material of the home, as these factors were highly correlated
with our exposures of interest and biomass fuel use.
Participants were unable to increase ventilation behavior
with existing infrastructure, as they were already practicing
high ventilation behavior at baseline. Additionally, concerns of
theft may limit a participant’s willingness to open doors and
windows, particularly among the poorest households, who
had lower ventilation behaviors compared with wealthier
homes. This study was conducted during hot, humid summer
months, when behaviors to increase household ventilation are
common. Findings from our qualitative exploration suggest
that many people have different ventilation behavior during the
winter, and indoor air pollution levels in Bangladesh are higher
during cooler, drier winter months compared with hot, humid
summer months.4,6 In our study, outdoor PM2.5 was associ-
ated with indoor PM2.5, with borderline statistical significance
and was highly polluted. Because outdoor air was highly
polluted, ventilation alone would not have been sufficient to
decrease indoor air pollution to safe levels. Additionally, the
effect of outdoor air pollution on indoor air pollution may be
different during summer months than during winter.6 Indoor
and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations were generally high for
longer durations at follow-up compared with baseline, al-
though this was more notable in poor ventilation compared
with good ventilation households. It is unclear why this is the
case, but it is possible that, since data collection occurred

 near the end of the monsoon season, this could reflect a
seasonal trend of increasing air pollution into the post-
monsoon season, as previously noted.4,6
We observed a small inverse association between the
number of hours that a door or window was opened and du-
ration of high PM2.5 concentrations, but we did not observe
such an association for number of hours of fan use. Although
Dasgupta and others have demonstrated a small association
between fan use and indoor air quality during the cooler, dry
winter season in Bangladesh,6 we did not observe this re-
lationship during the hot and rainy season, when we con-
ducted this pilot study. Fan use decreased at follow-up, likely
due to reduced electricity availability. In a megacity such as
Dhaka, with an unstable electricity supply, household inter-
ventions that rely on electricity are not feasible. In addition to
electricity availability, perceived cost of electric bills and
concerns about fan longevity were barriers to fan use. Par-
ticipants were averse to wasting electricity, and fan use was
perceived as wasting electricity. It is clear that fan use is not a
feasible intervention for those who live in low-income areas
with unreliable electricity supplies.
Installation of a new window was not widely accepted, es-
pecially by landlords of the participants. Our small sample size
may have limited our ability to observe an effect of the ventila-
tion intervention on air quality. Because few ventilation in-
tervention studies have been conducted, there is little literature
on the feasibility and acceptability of interventions to improve
ventilation. We have identified only one such study from rural
South Africa, in which ventilation behaviors, keeping at least
two sources of ventilation (doors or windows) open while a fire
was burning, were found to be acceptable and feasible, al-
though repairing broken windows was believed to be too
costly.20 The main motivator for new window installation in our
study was comfort. The main non-modifiable barrier to window
installation was a lack of physical space in the housing struc-
ture. Those who did not receive a structural intervention were
more likely to have at least one brick or concrete wall in their
home compared with those who received a structural in-
tervention. It is possible that, as brick and concrete are difficult
to cut into, participants or landlordsrefused window installation
based on building materials. We identified several potentially
modifiable barriers to installing a new window, including per-
ceived risk of theft, landlord refusal, and appearance. The
windows that we installed had iron bars and shutters, which
could discourage theft. Developing a variety of appropriate
models for varying wall construction and effectively commu-
nicating beneficial features to residents may increase interest in
window installation. Although many participants were not able
to provide an estimate for the cost of a window, most of those
who responded believed that the actual cost of a new window
would be affordable. Further evidence is needed to understand
why landlords refused window installation. Landlords’ interest
in improving structural ventilation could lead to better ventila-
tion status and, therefore, more comfortable and potentially
healthier living areas for their tenants.
This study has several important limitations. Envisioned as a
pilotstudy,thisstudyhada smallsamplesize. Moreover, based
on landlord and tenant willingness, window installation was
only possible in nine homes, which may not be sufficient to fully
describe the effect of windows on air pollution concentrations.
We may have failed to observe statistically significant findings
due to the small sample size. Additionally, there may be
fundamental differences between poor and good ventilation
households. We used University of California Berkeley air
quality monitors, which have a relatively high limit of detection,
50 mg/m3, which is twice the WHO-recommended 24-hour limit
for PM2.5.3,4,27,28 We were unable to detect relatively low PM2.5
concentrations. Thus, we may have underestimated the impact
of the intervention. This study did not entail a robust behavior
change strategy, and follow-up was within 7 days. This may not
be long enough to sustain or observe behavior change. Future
studies should focus on improving behavior change strategies
and be carried out over a longer period.
CONCLUSIONS
The poorest participants in this heterogeneous community
lived in the worst housing conditions, with poor ventilation, long
durations of high air pollution, and little sunlight. This at least
partially explains the pathway by which children in poor house-
holds may be susceptible to ALRI, although we did not examine
healthoutcomesinthisstudy.Fromthispilotstudy,weobserved
evidence that good ventilation status in a home is associated
with reduced duration of high PM2.5 concentrations. Addition of
one window in a home may reduce the duration of high PM2.5
concentrations, but a larger sample size is needed to verify this
observation. Opening doors and windows had a small effect on
duration of high PM2.5 concentrations. We also identified several
motivators, including comfort, and barriers, including perceived
risk of theft, lack of physical space, and landlord refusal, for
ventilation interventions. In a future, larger study, there is a need
to more clearly understand ventilation structure and behaviors
and how they may affect air quality and ALRI.
