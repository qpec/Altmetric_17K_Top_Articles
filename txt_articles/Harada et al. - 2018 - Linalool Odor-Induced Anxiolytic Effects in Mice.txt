In folk medicine, it has long been believed that odorous compounds derived from plant
extracts can have anxiolytic effects. Among them, linalool, one of the terpene alcohols
in lavender extracts, has been reported to have the anxiolytic effects. However, the
anxiolytic nature of the linalool odor itself as well as its potential action through the
olfactory system has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we examined the
anxiolytic effects of linalool odor with light/dark box test and with elevated plus maze
(EPM), and found that linalool odor has an anxiolytic effect without motor impairment in
mice. The effect was not observed in anosmic mice, indicating that it was triggered
by olfactory input evoked by linalool odor. Furthermore, the effect was antagonized
by flumazenil, indicating that the linalool odor-induced anxiolytic effect was mediated
by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission via benzodiazepine (BDZ)-responsive
GABAA receptors. These results provide information about the potential central neuronal
mechanisms underlying the odor-induced anxiolytic effects and the foundation for
exploring clinical application of linalool odor in anxiety treatments.

INTRODUCTION
Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent class of mental disorders. About 5.3% of adults in Japan or
18.2% of adults in the USA meet the diagnostic criteria for at least one anxiety disorder within the
past 12-months (Demyttenaere et al., 2004). Due to these high rates, the development of effective
therapy and therapeutic tools for treating anxiety disorders is the one of the more pressing issues
in the field of mental science.
Therapy utilizing anxiolytic drugs has long been a first-line choice as an effective treatment
options for anxiety disorders (Hoffman and Mathew, 2008). The most well-developed and
commonly prescribed drugs used to treat anxiety disorders are azapirons and serotonin
selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which modulate serotonergic synaptic transmission,
and benzodiazepines (BDZs), which modulates γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic (Ravindran and
Stein, 2010). However, the side effects (e.g., clinical effect delay, headache, somnolence, dizziness
and serotonin syndrome for azapirones; clinical effect delay, sexual dysfunction and serotonin
syndrome for SSRI; abuse, dependence liability, retrograde amnesia, and sedation for BDZs) of
these drugs can be severe and more detrimental than the anxiety itself so further development of
new drugs is still expected and necessary (Nash and Nutt, 2005).
In addition to anxiolytic pharmaceuticals, aromatic compounds derived from plant
extracts have been used in traditional medicine as a treatment for anxiety (Connor and
Vaishnavi, 2009). For example, lavender extract has been used to treat patients suffering
from anxiety (Kasper et al., 2010). Several compounds extracted from lavender, such as linalool,

Anxiolytic Effects of Linalool Odor
were reported to have anxiolytic effects (De Sousa et al., 2015).
However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the reported
anxiolytic effects of the odorous compounds have not yet been
fully revealed. In the case of linalool, the anxiolytic effects of the
odor itself have also not yet been addressed.
In this study, we examined the anxiolytic effects of
linalool odor in mice. Classical anxiety-related behavioral tests
showed that exposure to linalool odor induced significant
anxiolytic effects. The effects were not observed in anosmic
mice, indicating that the effects were triggered by olfactory
input evoked by linalool odor. Furthermore, we found that
flumazenil antagonized the linalool odor-induced anxiolytic
effects, indicating that BDZ-sensitive GABAergic transmission
plays a pivotal role for the anxiolytic effects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male wild type mice (C57BL/6N, 25–35 g, n = 240) originally
purchased from CLEA Japan (Tokyo, Japan) were used to
avoid possible variations related to menstrual cycling in females.
All animals were maintained under a constant temperature
(24 ± 1◦C) with free access to food and water. Animals were
housed with lights on at 7:00 A.M. and off at 7:00 P.M. All
experiments were performed during the light cycle, between
12:00 P.M. and 5:00 P.M. Animals were naive to linalool odor and
drugs, and each mouse was used only once to avoid carry-over
effects. Animals were acclimatized over 3 days with 3 min of
handling on each day. On experiment days, mice were moved
to the experiment room 3 h prior to the start of the experiment.
All experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines
outlined by the Physiological Society of Japan and were approved
by the Experimental Animal Research Committee of Kagoshima
University.
Drugs
Cercine� (5 mg/mL Diazepam (positive allosteric modulator
for γ-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABAARs) with BDZ
binding site, 1.5 mg/kg i.p.; Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.,
Osaka, Japan)), Flumazenil (selective antagonist for BDZ site
of GABAARs 3 mg/kg i.p.) and WAY100635 (antagonist
for serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1AR), 0.5 mg/kg i.p.; Tocris
Bioscience, Boston, MO, USA) were purchased. Diazepam was
diluted with 0.9% NaCl. Flumazenil and WAY100635 were
dissolved in Tween80 and diluted with 0.9% NaCl (final
concentration of Tween80 was 2%). All drugs and vehicle (2%
Tween80 in 0.9% NaCl) were injected intraperitoneally 30 min
before behavioral tests. Linalool was purchased from Tokyo
Chemical Industry. 3-methylindole (3-MI; 300 mg/kg i.p.; Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) was injected intraperitoneally for olfactory
epithelium deprivation. Corn oil was used as vehicle for 3-MI.
Linalool Odor Exposure
Linalool odor exposure was performed in a custom-made odor
chamber. A piece of 2 cm × 2 cm filter paper treated with
0, 20, 200, or 2,000 µL of linalool was placed at each of the
four corners of an acryl box (25 cm × 25 cm × 25 cm). A
mouse was placed into an acryl cage with a wire netting cover
(12 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm) and was placed at the center of the odor
chamber. Mice were unable to access the odor source directly,
but were exposed to odorized air. In this odor chamber, mice
were exposed to linalool odor for 30 min. After the exposure, a
behavioral test was given to the mice. For odorless air exposed
group, a mouse was placed in the odor chamber as linalool
exposed group with only exception that filter papers in the
acryl box were not soaked with linalool. To prevent the residual
linalool odor, we used another odor chambers for odorless air
exposed group. All acryl boxes and cages were changed with
respect to each subject and were washed with water and cleaned
up with 70% ethanol after daily sessions.
Light/Dark Box Test
The Light/Dark box apparatus (modified from CPP box,
Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure anxiety
(Crawley, 1981). It consisted of an acryl box with two equally
sized compartments (25 cm × 18 cm × 21 cm); a light
compartment, and a dark compartment. The two compartments
were connected with a small entrance (8 cm × 6 cm) and a
plastic sheet was spread on the floor of both chambers. The light
compartment was illuminated by LED lamp to an intensity of
400 LUX on the floor. The dark compartment was covered with
a black lid to shield from light. Mice were placed in the light
compartment with their back to the entrance, and behaviors were
recorded with a digital video camera for 5 min. The video data
was analyzed by EthoVision XT to measure the time spent in light
compartment and to measure the number of entries into the light
compartment. After each test, the chambers of the light/dark box
were washed with water and cleaned up with 70% ethanol.
Elevated Plus Maze Test
The elevated plus maze apparatus (EPM-04M, Muromachi Kikai,
Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure anxiety (Lister, 1987). It
consisted of two open arms (30 cm × 6 cm) and two closed arms
with walls on the side and the end (30 cm × 6 cm × 15 cm), and
central platform (6 cm × 6 cm). The height of the arm was 40 cm
from the floor. Illumination was set to 100 LUX on the central
platform floor. The mouse was placed on the central platform
facing the open arms and was videotaped for 5 min. The video
data was analyzed by EthoVision XT to measure the time spent
in open arms and the number of entries into open arms and the
total distance moved. After each test, the maze was washed with
water and cleaned with 70% ethanol.
Accelerated Rotarod Test
To assess the motor coordination and balance, we performed
accelerating rotarod test (Jones and Roberts, 1968) using single
lane rotarod apparatus (MK-630B, Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo,
Japan). Mice received two trained trials (each trial continued
for 300 s with fixed-speed (4 rpm)) with 30 min interval on
two consecutive days prior to testing for acclimatization to the
apparatus. On the experimental day, after 30 min exposure to
odor, mice were placed on the rotating bar and the rotating
speed of the rotarod was gradually increased from 4 rpm to

Anxiolytic Effects of Linalool Odor
40 rpm within 300 s. The time remained on the rotating bar was
measured (Vincenzi et al., 2013).
Olfactory Epithelium Deprivation
For olfactory deprivation, we disrupted the olfactory epithelium
by intraperitoneal administration of 3-MI, which induces
extensive destruction of the olfactory mucosa, resulting in
anosmia (Kim et al., 2010). Briefly, 300 mg/kg of 3% 3-MI in
corn oil was administered by intraperitoneal injection. In control
group, 10 mL/kg of corn oil was administered by intraperitoneal
injection in control group. Two weeks after the injection, 3-MI
treated mice were used for the behavioral test (Tashiro et al.,
2016).
Olfactory Habituation/Dishabituation Test
for Anosmia
When an animal smells a novel odor, the animal investigates the
odor by approaching and sniffing. With repeated presentations
of the odor, the number of approaching to the odor and the time
spent for sniffing the odor are progressively reduced (habituates).
When the animal is exposed to a novel odor and detects the new
odor, the animal shows renewed investigation.
Based on the innate behavior, we performed olfactory
habituation/dishabituation tests to confirm whether 3-MI treated
mice were anosmic for linalool (Gregg and Thiessen, 1981; Guan
et al., 1993; Luo et al., 2002; Woodley and Baum, 2003). A 3-MI
treated mouse was placed in a cage (12 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm)
with a wire-mesh lid and was exposed to a cotton swab soaked
with 20 µL of water three times for 2 min (habituation trials),
and then exposed to a cotton swab soaked with 20 µL of linalool
for 2 min (dishabituation test trial). Number of approaches
and time spent sniffing to the cotton swab were recorded as
exploratory behaviors. Approaching was defined as the action
of the mouse moving its nose to within 10 mm of the cotton
swab. Sniffing was defined as the action of the mouse keeping
its nose to within 10 mm of the swab for at least 1 s to
smell.

RESULTS
Linalool Odor Exposure Induces Anxiolytic
Effects in Mice
To examine the anxiolytic effects of linalool odor, we performed
classical tests for anxiety immediately after mice were exposed
to linalool vapor (Figure 1). Light/Dark box testing revealed
FIGURE 1 | Anxiolytic effects of linalool inhalation and diazepam injection in

test, time spent in light box (A) and number of entries to light box (B) were
significantly increased in the linalool group. In the EPM test, time spent in open

in the linalool group. n = 10 for all groups in (A–D). (E) Latency to drop off

that exposure to linalool odor significantly increased exploratory

(Tukey’s multiple comparison test); number of light box

effects of linalool odor exposure, we next performed the
EPM test (Figures 1C,D). The results showed a significant
increase of exploration of the open arms (time spent in open
arms: F(2,27) = 12.35, p = 0.0002, statistical power = 0.9958

n = 10 per group), again indicating anxiolytic effects of linalool
odor. Next, to examine whether linalool odor exposure impaired
motor function, we performed accelerating rotarod test. The
latency to drop off in the linalool odor-exposed group was
not significantly different from that in the odorless air-exposed
group (t = 0.121, p = 0.906, statistical power = 0.05147
(unpaired t-test); ncontrol = 6, nlinalool = 7), suggesting that
the coordinated motor skill was not affected by linalool odor
exposure (Figure 1E). From these results, we concluded that
linalool vapor exposure induced anxiolytic effects without motor
impairment in mice.

effects,

indicated that time spent in open arms (Figure 2A) and
total number of open arm entries (Figure 2B) increased
in accordance with the increase of the linalool dose (time

plinalool 20-linalool 2000 = 0.0203 (Tukey’s multiple comparison test);
n = 10 per group). It should be noted that the total distance
moved during the EPM test was not significantly affected by
linalool odor exposure (Figure 2C; F(3,36) = 1.137, p = 0.3472
(one-way ANOVA), statistical power = 0.3086; n = 10 per group),
suggesting that the effects of linalool odor were anxiolytic rather
than sedative.
Linalool Vapor-Induced Anxiolytic Effects
Were Triggered by Olfactory Input
To examine whether the anxiolytic effects were triggered
by olfactory input evoked by linalool odor exposure, we
assessed the effects in anosmic mice (Figure 3). In 3-MI

the

multiple comparison test); n = 10 per group). After the anxiety
tests, we assigned 10 3-MI mice and 10 vehicle administered mice
to olfactory habituation/dishabituation test. The result showed
that exploratory behaviors towards the linalool odor were not
observed in 3-MI mice, indicating that 3-MI treated mice
could not detect the odor of linalool l (Figures 4A,B; number

The GABAergic System Mediates the
Linalool Odor-Induced Anxiolytic Effects
The beneficial effects of BDZs and azapirones in treating anxiety
disorders indicate the involvement of BDZ-responsive GABAARs
and 5-HT1ARs. To assess whether those receptors were involved
in the linalool odor-induced anxiolytic effects, we performed the
EPM test to examine the linalool odor-induced anxiolytic effects,
but administered either flumazenil (antagonist for BDZ site of
GABAARs) or WAY100635 (5-HT1AR antagonist) before the
test (Figure 5). Pretreatment of flumazenil completely abolished

DISCUSSION
Technical Limitations of This Study
In this study, we showed the linalool odor-induced anxiolytic
effects only in adult male mice. To have a general understanding
of the phenomena, we further need to assess the effects on female
(for examining the sex differences) and on younger/elder mice
(for examining the age dependency).
Olfactory Input Evoked by Linalool Odor
Induced Anxiolytic Effects
In this study, we found that exposure to linalool odor induced
anxiolytic effects in mice (Figure 1). The effects were not
observed in anosmic mice (Figure 4), indicating that the
effects were triggered by olfactory input evoked by linalool
odor exposure. Previously, several studies have examined that
linalool inhalation induced anxiolytic effects (Linck et al., 2010;

Takahashi et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2016). However, because the
contribution of the olfactory system was not directly examined,
the nature of how linalool may induce the effects was not
revealed. In this study, we confirmed that the olfactory system
was essential for the linalool odor-induced anxiolytic effects
using anosmic mice (Figures 3, 4). Thus, we established that
the olfactory input triggered by linalool odor was responsible for
inducing the anxiolytic effects.
In addition to linalool, several other odors have also been
reported to induce anxiolytic effects when inhaled. For example,
inhalation of (+)-limonene Lima et al. (2013), linalool oxide
Souto-Maior et al. (2011), or α-pinene (Satou et al., 2014) were
shown to reduce anxiety in mice. In these studies, authors did
not address the contribution of olfactory input to the anxiolytic
effects. However, inhalation of these odorous compounds may
trigger the anxiolytic effects via olfactory input. It is noteworthy
that the effects resulting from limonene inhalation were not
antagonized by pre-treatment of flumazenil (Lima et al., 2013).
Taken together with our results, it is possible that there may be at
least two parallel anxiolytic pathways involving BDZ-responsive
GABAARs-dependent, and -independent systems evoked by
olfactory input.
Due to the fact that a given odorant receptor is activated
by a range of odor molecules with similar structure(s) (Malnic
et al., 1999), a range of odor molecules may also trigger
specific central neuronal circuits required for linalool-induced
anxiolytic effects. For further analyses, identification of the
odorant receptor(s) contributing to the odor-induced anxiolytic
effects and a systematic survey of odorants which act upon
the receptor(s) would be beneficial. In addition to the odorant
receptors, T-type calcium channels (TTCCs) are also affected
by linalool (El Alaoui et al., 2017). Because the TTCCs
contribute to the generation of action potentials in olfactory
sensory neurons (Kawai et al., 1996), the modulation of
TTCCs by linalool may also contribute to linalool odor-induced
analgesia.
Several studies have previously reported that systemic
administration of linalool intraperitoneally (Umezu et al.,
2006; Coelho et al., 2011; Guzman-Gutierrez et al., 2012)
or orally (Cheng et al., 2015) induced anxiolytic effects.
FIGURE 5 | Influence of pretreatment with flumazenil or WAY100635 on the anxiolytic effects of linalool. The increase in time spent in open arms (A) and number of
entries to open arms (B) from linalool odor exposure were eliminated in mice treated with flumazenil, but not with WAY100635 in linalool odor-induced anxiolytic
effects. Pretreatment with flumazenil or WAY100635 without linalool odor exposure did not affect exploratory behaviors. Control, mice exposed to odorless air;
Linalool, mice exposed to 200 µL of linalool; VEH; mice administered vehicle (2% Tween80 in saline); Flu, mice administered flumazenil (3 mg/kg i.p.); WAY, mice
administered WAY100635 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.); each column represents mean ± SEM; n = 10 for all groups. ∗∗P < 0.01, ∗∗∗∗P < 0.0001 compared to the Control + VEH

Anxiolytic Effects of Linalool Odor
In these studies, the primary sites that are affected by linalool
were not addressed. However, it has been assumed that
linalool entering the bloodstream via absorption through the
airway may modulate the glutamatergic neurotransmission
(Elisabetsky et al., 1995; Batista et al., 2008). Another possibility
raised by our results is that systemically administrated-
linalool may be emitted in the exhaled breath and drive the
anxiolytic effects via olfactory system retronasally (Kikuta et al.,
2016).
Neuronal Circuits Underlying the Linalool
Odor-Induced Anxiolytic Effects
In this study, we showed that flumazenil administration
completely abolished the linalool odor-induced anxiolytic effects
(Figure 5). Flumazenil blocks the GABA-induced anxiolytic
effects by antagonizing the BDZ site of α2-GABAAR (Rudolph
et al., 1999; Low et al., 2000). Because there were no longer
anxiolytic effects from linalool odor when olfactory deprived
mice were used (Figure 3), the effects may not be evoked by direct
activation of BDZ sites with linalool, but rather by activation of
intrinsic anxiolytic circuits involving GABAergic transmission
via BDZ-responsive GABAAR.
In contrast to the antagonism of flumazenil, 5-HT1AR
antagonist WAY100635 did not show any significant changes to
linalool odor-induced anxiolytic effects (Figure 5B). Clinical and
preclinical studies have indicated that the serotonergic system
which includes 5-HT1AR, also plays a key role in modulating
anxiety and is one of the major targets of the clinical treatment
targets (Gordon and Hen, 2004; Albert et al., 2014). On the other
hand, our findings suggest that the serotonergic transmission via
5-HT1AR may not be involved in the anxiolytic effects induced
by linalool odor.
In summary, we found that linalool odor exposure induced
anxiolytic effects without motor impairment in mice. The effects
were abolished in anosmic mice, indicating that olfactory input
evoked by linalool odor was necessary to trigger the effects.
Furthermore,
synaptic
transmission
with
BDZ-responsive
GABAARs was also essential for the effects. These findings
give us a foundation towards clinical application of linalool
odor for anxiety disorders. Moreover, linalool odor-induced
anxiolytic effects may be applicable for preoperative patients
because pretreatment with anxiolytics can alleviate preoperative
stress and thus contribute to place patients under general
anesthesia more smoothly. In addition, for patients who may
have difficulties with oral or suppository administration of
anxiolytics, such as infants, utilizing linalool odor to help reduce
anxiety may be a convenient and promising alternative.
