fatigue syndrome: a response to WILSHIRE

Abstract
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is chronic disabling illness characterized by severe disabling fatigue, typically made
worse by exertion. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) is thought by some to be the same disorder (then referred to as
CFS/ME) and by others to be different. There is an urgent need to find effective treatments for CFS. The UK Medical
Research Council PACE trial published in 2011 compared available treatments and concluded that when added to
specialist medical care, cognitive behaviour therapy and graded exercise therapy were more effective in improving
both fatigue and physical function in participants with CFS, than both adaptive pacing therapy and specialised
medical care alone. In this paper, we respond to the methodological criticisms of the trial and a reanalysis of the
trial data reported by Wilshire at al. We conclude that neither the criticisms nor the reanalysis offer any convincing
reason to change the conclusions of the PACE trial.

The PACE trial
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a chronic disabling
illness characterized by severe disabling fatigue, typically
made worse by exertion. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis
(ME) is thought by some to be the same disorder (then
referred to as CFS/ME) and by others to be different.
The cause of CFS is unknown. There is an urgent need
for effective treatments.
The PACE trial compared the effectiveness of available
non-drug treatments. In a four-arm randomised trial it com-
pared three therapies, given as additions to specialist medical
care (SMC) and SMC alone. It found that, 12 months after
randomisation, two of the therapies, cognitive behaviour
therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) were
more effective in improving both patient-reported fatigue
and physical functioning (the main defining symptoms of
CFS), than either adaptive pacing therapy (APT) or specialist
medical care (SMC) alone [1].
The trial was funded by the UK Medical Research
Council (MRC). Six hundred forty-one participants were
recruited after rigorous assessment for eligibility from
six clinical services in the UK; randomisation was done
by an independent Trials Unit; the trial treatments were
specified in detailed manuals and were rigorously moni-
tored for quality; there was very little loss to follow up
(5 %) at the final 12 month outcome assessment; the
main trial analysis was conducted by a statistician (KG)
blind to treatment allocation and supervised by an
additional and senior MRC statistician. Whilst, as with
almost all behavioural medicine trials, it was not possible
to blind participants to the treatment allocation, the
delivery of the three therapies was carefully matched for
patient contact time to mimimise non-specific treatment
effects. Finally, all aspects of the trial were overseen by
an MRC approved independent Trial Steering Com-
mittee and Data Monitoring Committee. The trial was
registered (ISRCTN54285094) and both the protocol
and a detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) were
published [2, 3]. The transparency of the PACE trial

 procedures was recognised in a review by the UK
Health Research Authority (HRA) [4].
The main trial findings were published in the Lancet
in 2011. A number of secondary papers were published
subsequently. One secondary paper was an exploration
of the relative rates of ‘recovery’ from CFS with each of
the trial treatments which reported that recovery was
more likely with CBT and GET than with the other two
treatments [5]. Another secondary paper was a post-trial
long-term naturalistic follow-up of trial participants
which found that the benefits of CBT and GET were
maintained 18 months after the end of the trial [6].
Here we respond to the recent paper by Wilshire et al.
which is a combined critique of all of the three trial
papers mentioned above [7]. We address each of the
main points they make in turn:
The PACE trial analysis plan
Wilshire et al. say that changes from an initial outline
analysis plan described in the trial protocol published in
2007 [2] to the final approved statistical analysis plan
(SAP) published in 2013 [3] were ‘highly problematic’
and led to bias in the trial outcomes.
We disagree that these changes were either ‘problem-
atic’ or a source of bias. There was no change in the
designated primary outcomes. The changes, which were
only in the scoring of the pre-specified outcomes, were
made in response to statistical advice, approved by the
Trial Data Monitoring and Steering Committees and
made before the data was analysed, as confirmed by a
UK HRA review of the trial conduct [4]. They were also
documented in the relevant published papers [1]. The
changes made were: (a) to use mean scores for each pri-
mary outcome (fatigue and physical function) separately
rather than as a composite outcome because composite
outcomes are difficult to interpret [8]. (b) to use Likert
type scoring (0, 1, 2, 3) rather binary scoring (0, 0, 1, 1)
for the fatigue scale to make the measure more accurate
and sensitive to change.
Reanalysis of the PACE trial data
Wilshire et al. report that, contrary to our findings, their
reanalysis of the trial data, which they based on our pre-
liminary analysis plan, yielded ‘null outcomes’.
We have read their reanalysis carefully and find it un-
convincing. This is because: First, it assumes, without
justification, that the original proposed scoring of pri-
mary outcomes described above, was more valid than
the method described in the final approved analysis plan.
Second, their reanalysis appears not to have been based
on a clear a priori analysis plan. Third, it only used part
of the trial dataset. Fourth, it employed analytic strat-
egies we consider questionable: For example, they omit-
ted data from an entire treatment arm of the four-arm
trial (APT). Despite these differences from our published
analysis, Wilshire et al. still found that both CBT and
GET were statistically superior to their only comparison
treatment (SMC, which they choose to refer to as ‘con-
trol’). However, they then abolished this statistical sig-
nificance by applying an excessive Bonferroni correction
for multiple testing (multiplying the required p values by
five or six, rather than by a more appropriate two) [7].
We have also previously published an analysis of the trial
based on the originally proposed but superseded scoring
methods favoured by Wilshire et al. and found that the
relative effect of the treatments remained similar to that
reported in the published PACE trial paper (with only
one of the planned comparisons was no longer statisti-
cally significant) [9, 10].
Patient reported outcomes
Wilshire et al. suggest that, as the primary outcomes in
PACE
were
participant-rated
(CFS
is
defined
by
self-report as there are no reliable objective measures)
and the participants inevitably knew what treatment they
were given (the therapies tested could not be blinded as
they were collaborative between therapist and partici-
pant), the trial findings can be dismissed as simply due
to participant bias when rating outcomes.
We disagree with this proposition. Whilst participant
rated outcomes do potentially pose a risk of bias for all tri-
als testing the effect of unblindable treatments, we do not
agree that this is a convincing alternative explanation for
the PACE trial findings. This is because: First, participants
did not just give global ratings at the end of treatment,
they answered specific questions about fatigue and func-
tion, as long as six months after therapy was completed,
making a transient ‘placebo’ type effect very unlikely. Sec-
ond, the majority of the trial secondary measures showed
a similar pattern as the primary outcomes. Third, and
most importantly, the trial design controlled for a
non-specific effect of treatment by comparing three ther-
apies (CBT, GET and APT) that were all attention and
credibility matched. Credibility matching was determined
by asking participants how logical they found the treat-
ment they were allocated to and how confident they were
it would help them before they received it; the credibility
rating of APT was higher than CBT, and similar to GET.
Despite this control the biggest difference in outcomes
was between APT and both CBT and GET. Indeed, one
could argue that if the participant rated outcomes had
been biased by the non-specific factors, such as perceived
credibility, APT should have performed best, when in fact
it performed worst.
Recovery
The issue of recovery from CFS was considered in a
secondary PACE paper which sought to estimate relative
Sharpe et al. BMC Psychology            (2019) 7:15 
Page 2 of 5
 proportions of participants in each trial arm who might
be considered to have ‘recovered’ from CFS [5]. We re-
ported that the rates of recovery, whilst modest, were
greater with CBT and GET than with APT and SMC
alone. Wilshire et al. report that their reanalysis of PACE
data yielded no difference in the rates of recovery be-
tween trial arms.
Whilst we agree that there is no generally accepted
definition of recovery from CFS, we disagree with this
conclusion [11]. In our paper we explored a number of
definitions of recovery using various thresholds on a
number of trial outcome variables. These were specified
before doing the analysis. Different definitions produced
different absolute rates of recovery, but a similar relative
difference between treatments, always favouring CBT
and GET [5, 12]. Wilshire et al. did a single analysis
using only our proposed but superseded criteria for re-
covery, which specified very high thresholds on the out-
come scales. They found only a
small proportion
(between three and 7 %) of patients could be considered
‘recovered’ in any of the trial arms. Inevitably, these very
small absolute differences between treatments became
statistically non-significant [7].
We prefer the definitions of recovery we used to those
used by Wilshire et al. as they give absolute rates more
consistent both with the literature, and with our clinical
experience. We also note that, even in Wilshire et al.’s
analysis, the relative rate of recovery with CBT and GET
was approximately twice that with APT and SMC alone.
Persistence of treatment effects
We examined long term (mean of 2.5 years from trial
entry) outcomes of trial treatment in a further paper [6].
Wilshire et al. dispute our finding that the benefit of
CBT and GET seen in both fatigue and physical function
at 12 months was maintained in the long-term.
We disagree with their conclusion which they base on
an analysis that compared the long-term outcomes be-
tween the originally randomised treatment groups [7].
As we explained in the paper, following the final trial
12-month outcome, patients were no longer in the trial.
That is, for the subsequent 18 months of the long-term
follow up we reported, treatment was no longer given
according to the original random allocation. Indeed, as
part of our original promise to participants, those who
remained unwell at the trial final follow up were offered
additional treatments by PACE trial therapists. The type
of additional treatment was determined by the partici-
pant’s SMC doctor, in negotiation with the participant. It
turned out that many participants allocated to APT and
SMC in the trial, received CBT or GET during the
post-trial follow up period. Consequently, it is mislead-
ing to analyse the data as a comparison between origin-
ally randomised groups as the random allocation no
longer applies and analysing data on a subgroup does
not overcome the problem of confounding of outcome
and treatment given.
For these reasons we reported our main analysis as a
comparison of patient outcomes over time within, not
between, their originally allocated groups. The graphs in
Fig. 2 and the figures in Table 3 of our follow up paper,
show clearly that the improvements in mean fatigue and
physical function scores found at the end of the trial in
participants originally allocated to CBT and GET, were
maintained at long-term follow up [6]. They also show,
as we reported, that patients who were allocated to APT
and SMC in the trial, many of whom had received
additional CBT of GET after the trial, also improved
over the post-trial follow up period. In summary the
improvements in fatigue and functioning seen from
baseline to final trial outcome in those originally allo-
cated to CBT and GET, were maintained at long-term
post-trial follow up.
Replication of the PACE trial findings
The ultimate test of any scientific finding is replication.
The PACE trial replicated findings from many earlier
randomised trials; systematic reviews and meta-analyses
support the efficacy of both CBT and GET as treatments
for CFS [13–17]. Furthermore, trials published after
PACE continue to find that these treatments to be both
safe and moderately effective for CFS and for related
syndromes [18–22]. Clinical case series continue to sup-
port their translation into clinical practice [22] and in a
qualitative study the majority of those who had been
given CBT reported that they were satisfied with it [23].
In summary, the findings of PACE do not stand alone
but have been replicated many times. These multiple
replications make the findings likely to be robust.
Other comments on the PACE trial findings
One often repeated reason for rejecting the PACE trial
findings, mentioned by Wilshire et al., is that the benefit
of rehabilitative therapies, especially GET found in trials,
is not reported by some patients in surveys [7]. This dis-
crepancy between the finding of clinical trials and those
of patient group surveys certainly requires explanation:
One explanation may be the patients who respond to
surveys are dissimilar to those who participated in the
trial. Another possible explanation may be the treat-
ments given outside of a trial were not as well delivered,
for example by being insufficiently collaborative or
recommending too rapid increases in activity. We sug-
gest that further research is needed to understand this
apparent difference between the finding of clinical trials
and those of patient surveys.
Another
argument alluded to by Wilshire et al. for
rejecting the findings of the PACE trial is that they imply
Sharpe et al. BMC Psychology            (2019) 7:15 
Page 3 of 5
 that CFS or ME is psychiatric or psychological in nature
(an illness designation still strongly stigmatised in our
society) rather than purely biomedical [24]. However
understandable this view may be, we believe it to be mis-
taken. The evidence that CBT and GET help patients
with CFS does not in fact indicate the cause of their ill-
ness. Indeed, the PACE trial main paper explicitly states:
“The effectiveness of behavioural treatments does not
imply that the condition is psychological in nature” [1].
In this context, it is also worth noting that similar ther-
apies have also been found to improve fatigue in ill-
nesses with established physical pathology such as
multiple sclerosis [25].
Conclusions
PACE was a large carefully designed and intensively
monitored clinical trial of different non-drug treatments
for CFS. Like all trials, it had limitations that are clearly
described in the papers reporting it. However, after care-
fully reviewing Wilshire et al’s criticisms of the PACE
trial findings, we can find no good reason to change its
conclusions.
We therefore restate that the PACE trial
found
that both CBT and GET, when given appropriately as
supplements to specialist medical care, are more effect-
ive in improving both fatigue and physical functioning in
people with CFS, than are APT and SMC alone.
