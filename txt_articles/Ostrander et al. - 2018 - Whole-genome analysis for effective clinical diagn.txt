Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) is a devastating epilepsy syndrome with onset in the first months of life. Although
mutations in more than 50 different genes are known to cause EIEE, current diagnostic yields with gene panel tests or whole-exome
sequencing are below 60%. We applied whole-genome analysis (WGA) consisting of whole-genome sequencing and
comprehensive variant discovery approaches to a cohort of 14 EIEE subjects for whom prior genetic tests had not yielded a
diagnosis. We identified both de novo point and INDEL mutations and de novo structural rearrangements in known EIEE genes, as
well as mutations in genes not previously associated with EIEE. The detection of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation in all
14 subjects demonstrates the utility of WGA to reduce the time and costs of clinical diagnosis of EIEE. While exome sequencing may
have detected 12 of the 14 causal mutations, 3 of the 12 patients received non-diagnostic exome panel tests prior to genome
sequencing. Thus, given the continued decline of sequencing costs, our results support the use of WGA with comprehensive variant
discovery as an efficient strategy for the clinical diagnosis of EIEE and other genetic conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) is a rare epilepsy
syndrome that causes intractable seizures with multiple seizure
types and presents in the first months of life. While the prevalence
of EIEE is unclear, and only affects a subset of all infants with
seizures (about 1.2 of 1000 live births),1 infants with EIEE have
serious medical complications. EIEE patients typically exhibit
developmental delay, profound intellectual impairment, and
progress to severe psychomotor impairment and early death.2,3
Structural brain malformations, birth injury, and inborn errors of
metabolism can cause EIEE, but once these causes are accounted
for most remaining cases of EIEE are presumed to have a genetic
basis.
Structural
variation
(SV)
such
as
large
deletions
or
duplications
are
identifiable
by
karyotype
or
chromosomal
microarray studies, and account for a relatively small proportion
of cases, with estimates between 6 and 18% in recent studies.4,5
Mutations in more than 50 different genes6 have been described
in
EIEE.
While
gene
panel
and
whole-exome
sequencing
approaches have been used in EIEE, diagnostic yields are no
higher than 60%.7–9 Since diagnostic testing by traditional means
can be expensive and continue for years,10–12 improving the
speed and reducing the cost associated with genetic tests would
have substantial clinical impact.
RESULTS
Subject cohort and sequencing
From 2015 to 2016, we recruited subjects with EIEE for whom no
underlying diagnosis was identified despite extensive prior
testing. We excluded subjects with established genetic, metabolic,
structural, or birth trauma-related causes. The final cohort
included 14 subjects for whom DNA was also available from both
parents (see Table 1 and Supp. Table 1 for extensive phenotypic
and prior testing information for these subjects). We anticipated
that, for the majority of subjects, the causative variant would be a
de novo mutation,13–16 which are notoriously difficult to detect
accurately from short-read sequencing data.17 Therefore, we
performed deep whole-genome Illumina sequencing on all 14
families (i.e., 42 individuals). Two sequencing lanes from two
distinct DNA libraries were used to maximize discovery in each
family, producing an average of 65× (range 51× to 93×) median
coverage per individual (see Supp. Table 2 and Supp. Fig. 1).
Increased sequence coverage provides greater power to detect de
novo mutations in subjects, and it also reduces false positive de
novo mutation predictions in cases where the transmitted allele is
not sequenced in one of the parents.17,18
Variant identification
After sequence alignment with BWA-MEM,19 we carried out
comprehensive detection of genetic variation in each EIEE family
trio, using a combination of existing alignment-based tools and
our reference-free approach (Methods). We scanned each family
for
single-nucleotide
variants
(SNVs)
and
insertion-deletions
(INDELs) using the GATK20 best practices pipeline. We also used
LUMPY21 to detect structural variants (SV) and copy number
variants (CNV), in conjunction with SVTyper22 to generate SV
genotypes for each family member. Because of the strong prior
expectation that the causative variant would be a de novo

 mutation in the affected child, we also applied RUFUS,23 our k-
mer-based, alignment-free analysis algorithm designed specifically
to reduce false positive de novo mutations predictions (see
Methods) and reveal mutations that can be missed by alignment-
based approaches.
Variant prioritization
With candidate de novo mutations detected in the 14 probands,
we followed a tiered variant prioritization strategy to identify
causative mutations (see Table 2). We first targeted missense,
frameshift, or nonsense coding mutations within known genes
associated with EIEE using both GEMINI24 and the web-based
variant visualization and interrogation tool gene.iobio (http://
gene.iobio.io). GEMINI was used to identify de novo mutations in
genes that ClinVar25 associated with the terms “epileptic” and
“infant”. To prioritize variants with gene.iobio, we first created an
inclusive list of 223 EIEE candidate genes (Supp. Table 4) by
merging genes across EIEE-specific gene panel tests and ClinVar,25
followed by a Phenolyzer26 search with the relevant phenotype
search terms (see Methods). Candidate variants were classified as
“pathogenic” or “likely pathogenic” according to ACMG criteria.27
In 9 of the 14 subjects, GEMINI identified a single, de novo
variant with high confidence in pathogenicity. Of these, seven
subjects carried de novo missense variants in ion-channel genes
(SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, KCNQ2) with known association to EIEE
(Table 2, Supp. Table 5). One subject had a de novo missense
variant in the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2
(EEF1A2) gene, and another subject harbored a one base pair
frameshift insertion in the syntaxin-binding protein 1 (STXBP1)
gene. In addition, gene.iobio identified a likely pathogenic
mutation in a tenth subject within the phosphatidylinositol glycan
anchor biosynthesis class A (PIGA) gene. Notably, these procedures
allowed us to rapidly (in less than 5 min) screen a comprehensive
candidate gene list and identify diagnostic variants in EIEE-
associated genes for 10 of the 14 subjects (subjects #1, 3–6, 8,
11–14).
For the remaining four subjects, we searched for de novo SVs
predicted to disrupt genes that have been previously implicated in
EIEE. In subject #7, we detected a 63 kb de novo duplication within
CDKL5. This copy number mutation created a tandem duplication
of exons 5 through 15 (Fig. 1a) that we predicted to cause a
frameshift when splicing of the mutant transcript joins exon 15
with the duplicated exon 5. In turn, the frameshift is predicted to
create a stop codon five amino acids downstream from the end of
the first copy of exon 15. The tandem duplication, frameshift, and
stop gain were confirmed by sequencing cDNA derived from a
fresh blood sample from subject #7 (Fig. 1b). This mutation is
predicted to have an X-linked recessive effect in our male patient
in a gene previously associated28–30 with EIEE.
For subjects #2, #9, and #10, we then searched for de novo
missense or putative loss of function (i.e., nonsense, frameshift,
and splice donor/acceptor) mutations in protein coding regions of
genes not previously associated with EIEE. This search led to 18,
22, and 12 GATK-called variants, and 0, 1, and 2 RUFUS-called
variants, respectively. Manually excluding low-quality variant calls
and reviewing the potential for association with the phenotype,
we excluded all but a single de novo variant (i.e., the one called by
RUFUS) in subject #9, in the DNA binding, SAND domain of the
DEAF1 gene. Missense variants in the SAND domain of DEAF1 have
been previously reported in association with dominant intellectual
disability phenotypes, and a severe recessive epilepsy pheno-
type.31,32 The same allele identified in subject #9 (p.G212S) was
recently reported in a 15-year-old male with developmental
regression and seizures.33 Functional studies suggest that this
allele eliminates both DEAF1 transcriptional repression activity
and DEAF1–DNA interactions.

 Subject #10 harbored a de novo missense variant in CAMK2G,
the gamma subunit of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II (CAMKII) complex. CAMKII is a multi-subunit complex that
plays an essential role in synaptic function including learning and
memory.34 The alpha and beta isoforms (CAMK2A and CAMK2B)
are involved in calcium signaling in glutamatergic synapses.35
Furthermore,
the CAMKII
complex has been implicated
in
temporal lobe epilepsy,36 and de novo mutations in CAMK2A
and CAMK2B were reported to cause intellectual disability.37 The
variant identified in our subject substitutes a threonine with
methionine in a highly conserved region of the catalytic subunit of
CAMK2G. This variant is extremely rare: it is observed as a
heterozygote in only one Finnish individual of >138,000 indivi-
duals sequenced in the gnomAD database,38 and incomplete
penetrance could explain the lack of a known seizure phenotype
for the gnomAD individual. While not directly associated with
epilepsy or other clinical phenotypes, CAMK2G has been predicted
to be a drug target for refractory epilepsies.39 A separate de novo
variant in CAMK2G (c.1075G>A, p.V359M) was observed in a
developmental disorder proband as part of the DDD study,40 but
pathogenicity details of the phenotype were not available.
Lastly, for subject #2 we identified a de novo, inverted, balanced
translocation between chromosome 2p16.1 and chromosome
Xq28 (Fig. 2). This rearrangement moves a short, but gene-dense
segment of chromosome X to chromosome 2. The translocated
segment of chromosome X includes 92 genes with a breakpoint
between MAGEA4 and GABRE. In this segment, three genes coding
for subunits of the GABA receptor genes (GABRE, GABRA3, and
GABRQ) and MECP2 have potential neurological phenotypes. Other
GABA receptor genes including GABRA1, GABRB1, and GABRB3
have been associated with severe epilepsy phenotypes.41 While
we did not find a sequence variant associated with epilepsy in this
subject, the translocation likely disrupts patterns of X-inactivation
and
alters
transcription
patterns.42
Furthermore,
MECP2
is
associated with Rett syndrome and is approximately 2 Mb from
the translocation breakpoint. There is some phenotypic similarity
between subject #2 and patients with Rett syndrome, including
microcephaly, seizures, and developmental regression. Further-
more, a Rett syndrome phenotype was described in a previous
patient42 with a pericentric inversion in the vicinity of MECP2. We
also identified a de novo variant in subject #2 that impacts an
intronic or upstream (depending on the isoform) POL2 binding site
within MECP2, though it is unclear if there is a change in transcript
level as a result of this variant. Given the known association
between MECP2 and infantile seizure disorders, as well as the Rett-
like phenotype of this subject, we hypothesize that the disruption
of MECP2 transcription is the most plausible mechanism.
This study represents the first diagnostic application of our
RUFUS de novo mutation detection method23 (manuscript in
preparation). In contrast to the read alignment-based variant
detection methods that are most commonly used today, the
alignment-free, k-mer-based RUFUS algorithm directly compares
k-mers in the sequencing reads between a child and his/her
parents to identify child-specific k-mers that suggest de novo
mutations. This strategy avoids the vast majority of the false
positive mutation calls that arise from read alignment artifacts in
alignment-based methods. Therefore, the main advantage of
RUFUS over alignment-based detection approaches is the much
higher specificity for calling mutations. For example, RUFUS
detected on average 1.7 coding de novo mutations per subject, as
compared to the average of 61.8 de novo mutation detected by
GATK (Supp. Table 3). In fact, in 6 of the 14 subject genomes,
RUFUS only called a single coding variant, and in 7 of the
14 subjects only a single-amino acid-changing variant (see Fig. 3
for an example). Furthermore, RUFUS detects all forms of de novo
mutation in a single step, including SNVs, short INDELs, and SVs,
thereby eliminating the need to run multiple detection programs
on the data. RUFUS detected all diagnostic and putative disease
causing mutations uncovered in this study, while reporting only a
handful of additional mutations affecting coding sequences.
DISCUSSION
Currently, clinical diagnosis of EIEE is not standardized, and can
include radiological imaging, metabolic testing, and genetic
testing ranging from single gene tests, to panel testing or
whole-exome sequencing.10,12 However, many subjects remain
undiagnosed, leading to prolonged and expensive diagnostic
odysseys. The increasing availability of high-throughput DNA
sequencing has led to an increased number of EIEE patients with
genetic diagnoses. In a recent study of a similar cohort of infants
with epileptic encephalopathies, a definitive genetic diagnosis
was reached in ~60% of infants using a combination of epilepsy
gene panels and whole-exome sequencing.43 Here, we identified a
genetic diagnosis in all 14 subjects using comprehensive WGA
that includes identification of both sequence variants and SVs. Our
results suggest that early implementation of methods interrogat-
ing spontaneous SVs, SNVs, and INDELs are necessary for
comprehensive EIEE diagnosis.
Furthermore, despite the current cost of clinical WGS (typically
currently ranging from $5000 to $15,000 per trio),44,45 it is more
cost and time effective than current diagnostic approaches. In our
cohort, the oldest child was more than 16 years of age when a
diagnosis was finally determined.

 minimum of 24 diagnostic tests (Supp. Table 6), resulting in
average charges of $30,866 (range $16,592–$50,348) prior to
whole-genome sequencing. Overall, charges in pursuit of diag-
nosis for the entire cohort was $432,121. Clinical whole-genome
costs are still higher than gene panels or whole-exome sequen-
cing. However, whole-genome sequencing as an initial diagnostic
strategy offers a potential time and cost-savings approach, and a
more comprehensive single-step evaluation of non-coding and
CNVs, compared to the standard approach of multiple, sequential
tests. In addition, while data processing and analysis requirements
are substantial, the turn-around time and cost of all high-
throughput sequencing approaches continues to drop, enabling
whole-genome sequencing to be employed in a clinical setting
with a turn-around of 14 days or less.46
In an effort to find a genetic diagnosis for each subject, we
sought greater than typical (~65×) sequencing depth per sample,
motivated by earlier observations17 that the accuracy of detecting
de novo variants with mapping-based detection approaches
improves with greater coverage. Using deep whole-genome
sequencing,
we
identified
pathogenic
or
likely
pathogenic
variants, as defined by the ACMG guidelines, in 12 of 14 cases;
and likely diagnostic variants in the remaining 2 of 14 subjects in
our cohort. These variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
The high specificity of variant detection is evidenced by the fact
that, for 10 of the 14 subjects, both our mapping-based and
reference-free methods only detected a single coding mutation in
a known EIEE-associated gene, and, in each case, this was the
diagnostic variant.
Since 12 of the 14 subjects harbored SNV or INDEL mutations in
EIEE-associated genes, it can be argued that exome sequencing is
a rational diagnostic alternative to whole-genome sequencing. We
note, however, that patients #5, #8, and #9 had been previously
tested with commercial, exome-based gene panels which failed to
report the mutations we observed with whole-genome sequen-
cing. Furthermore, we emphasize that whole-genome sequencing
was critical to the discovery of diagnostic variants in two of our
cases. Neither the precise structure and consequence of the CDKL5
tandem duplication in subject #2, nor the reciprocal translocation
in subject #7, could be characterized with gene panels or exome
sequencing. Finally, the detection of a potentially regulatory de
novo mutation in MECP2 was only possible using whole-genome
sequencing for subject #2.
Given the continued improvements in the cost and speed of
whole-genome sequencing, we argue that, in the next few years,
whole-genome sequencing approaches are likely to become the
standard approach to arriving at a definitive EIEE diagnosis. In
general, whole-genome sequencing offers particular advantages
for clinical diagnosis of monogenic diseases with well-defined
phenotypes, where the majority of causative genes are largely
known. Polygenic disorders or diseases with substantial environ-
mental risk factors are less amenable to diagnosis with WGS owing
to the complexity of confidently identifying the set of genetic
changes driving the phenotype. Our high diagnosis rate was
facilitated by the availability of parental DNA for all subjects; the
existence of a fairly well-defined set of candidate genes involved
in epilepsy; having sufficient sequencing depth to confidently
detect de novo mutations; the use of complementary tools for the
discovery of all forms of genetic variation; and the fact that EIEE
patients are enriched for pathogenic de novo mutations. We
anticipate that whole-genome sequencing will ultimately provide
improvements in the diagnosis of a broad range of other genetic
disorders, including leukodystrophies, skeletal dysplasias, and
congenital cardiac diseases.

An inverted, reciprocal translocation between chromosomes X and 2. a The inverted translocation in subject 2 results in DNA exchange
between the X chromosome and chromosome 2. The chromosome 2 break occurred in the p arm at position 59,405,748, leaving minor (24%)
and major (76%) portions, and the chromosome X break occurred at the extreme q arm at position 151,118,513 leaving a minor (3%) and
major (97%) portions. As a result, GABRE, GABRA3, and MECP2 are translocated from the X chromosome to chromosome 2. b A de novo
mutation in subject 2 is also observed that is intronic to multiple isoforms (e.g., ENST00000303391) of MECP2 and upstream of other isoforms
(e.g., ENST00000415944) of MECP2. The mutation lies within the observed binding site of multiple transcription factors, including Pol II

 outpatient clinics at Primary Children’s Hospital (PCH) between 2015 and
2016, who were born between 2004 and 2016. We reviewed history and
EEG findings to confirm the diagnosis of EIEE. We also reviewed MRI and
laboratory data to confirm that subjects did not have an inborn error of
metabolism, an established genetic diagnosis, or a structural brain
abnormality.
Cohort consent
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the
University of Utah and PCH. Written informed consent was obtained from
the parents of the patients. After obtaining informed consent, proband and
parents were enrolled in the study.
Sequencing
DNA was extracted from blood or saliva. Genomes of the 42 study
individuals were prepared using TruSeq DNA PCR-free libraries (Illumina)
and run on the Illumina HiSeq X Ten System at a minimum of 60× median
whole-genome coverage.
Sequence processing
Sequence reads were aligned to the GRCh37 reference genome (including
decoy sequences from the GATK resource bundle) using the BWA-MEM19
read alignment program. BAM files were de-duplicated with samblaster.22
INDEL realignment and base quality recalibration was performed using the
GATK package.47
Quality control
After alignment we evaluated global coverage using indexcov48 and
verified that there were no major anomalies, and that the relative coverage
levels on the sex chromosomes matched the expected sexes. After variant
calling was completed, we ran peddy49 to verify that the relationships
inferred from the genotypes matched those reported in the pedigree
information and to evaluate depth of coverage in variant calls and ancestry

 composition. We also utilized mosdepth50 to extract per-base coverage
and to estimate sequence coverage for each sample (Supp. Table 2).
Variant identification using mapping-based variant calling
methods
Single-nucleotide
and
INDEL
variant
calling
and
genotyping
was
performed with the GATK Haplotype Caller.47 The resulting variant calls
included both inherited and de novo variants (in the probands). SV
identification was performed using the LUMPY program.21 The SVTyper
subprogram was used to genotype each sample at each called SV
candidate site. The resulting variant calls included both inherited and de
novo variants in the probands.
De novo variant prioritization.
GEMINI24 version 0.19.0 was used to
identify high confidence, single-nucleotide, and INDEL de novo mutations
for which each member of a family trio had a sequencing depth of at least
15 and a genotype quality of at least 10. Candidate mutations were also
required to be predicted to have an impact severity of “MED” or “HIGH” in
GEMINI (i.e., “missense”, “frameshift”, “stop_gained”, “stop_lost”, etc; see
http://gemini.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/database_schema.
html#details-of-the-impact-and-impact-severity-columns for details) and to
have an allele frequency of no greater than 0.001 in any of the sub
populations in the ExAC38 database. Predicted impacts on protein function
were annotated with VEP38,51 before the creation of the GEMINI database.
Finally, candidate de novo mutations were restricted to those that
ClinVar25 associated with disease terms “infant” and “epileptic”. The
following command was used to identify candidate de novo mutations.
gemini de_novo -d 15 --min-gq 10 --columns “chrom, start, end, ref, alt,
is_lof, codon_change, aa_change, gene, impact, clinvar_gene_phenotype,
max_aaf_all” --filter “impact_severity! = ‘LOW’ and max_aaf_all < 0.001
and call_rate >= 0.95 and aaf < 0.05 and clinvar_gene_phenotype like ‘%
epileptic%’ and clinvar_gene_phenotype like ‘%infant%’” Projects/eiee/
ostrander-eiee.sav.db
Candidate de novo structural mutations were identified by screening the
LUMPY SV predictions in each family for variants where the proband had a
variant genotype, and both parents had homozygous reference genotypes.
We further required the proband to have at least 15 alignments (paired-
end or split-read) supporting the de novo SV and each parent to have zero
supporting reads. We then removed SVs where either end overlapped a
simple repeat defined by the UCSC genome browser for build 37 of the
human
genome.
After
these
steps,
only
two
SVs
remained:
the
translocation in family 42,610, and the duplication in family 44,133.
De novo variant identification using our RUFUS reference-free
detection method
The unpublished RUFUS reference-free de novo variant calling algorithm23
was used to call de novo variants in the probands within each of the 14
families. Rufus works by directly comparing the k-mer sequences from the
raw Illumina reads between a child and his/her parents, to identify unique
DNA sequence present in the child but not in the parents, thus
representing de novo mutations. Sequencing reads containing such
unique K-mer sequences are assembled using an in-built sequence
assembler. Assembled contigs, containing the de novo mutant allele, are
mapped back to the human reference sequence for localization, using the
BWA-MEM19 algorithm. The BWA-MEM alignment files are parsed and
converted to a VCF53 format variant report output. All types of de novo
mutations (SNPs, short INDELs, and SVs of all types) are identified in a
single run of the program.
Variant prioritization using the gene.iobio tool.
Gene.iobio (http://gene.
iobio.io) version 2.0 was used to identify the most likely disease-causing de
novo variant in each subject. We first generated an exhaustive list of
candidate genes that have been either known to harbor EIEE-causing
mutations, or may plausibly harbor such mutations (see Supp. Table 4). We
retrieved the list of genes part of EIEE diagnostic panel tests from four
clinical diagnostic laboratories (Ambry: 100 genes, GeneDX: 87 genes,
Invitae: 63 genes, and University of Chicago: 59 genes). We also used the
Phenolyzer tool to generate a gene list using the phenotype term “EIEE”,
and considered the top 100 genes on this list. We then merged the five
lists; this resulted in our EIEE candidate gene list of 223 unique entries.
Second, for each subject, we selected the RUFUS-called de novo mutation
candidates using the “Files” tab from within gene.iobio. Here we also
selected the sequence alignment (BAM) files for the subject (child) and
both parents, so we can examine the sequence coverage at candidate de
novo mutation sites. We then uploaded the list of 223 EIEE candidate
genes using the “Genes” tab. Third, we activated the “Analyze all genes”
button to annotate, assess the predicted impact, and rank each candidate
de novo mutation in the subject. This analysis lasted a few minutes. After
de novo mutations in every candidate gene are ranked, gene.iobio
automatically re-sorts the genes, according to the most harmful variant
present in the gene (see Fig. 3 for an illustration).
Mutation confirmation.
All mutations we confirmed with Sanger sequen-
cing, with the exception of the mutation predicted in EEF1A2. We were
unable to obtain an amplicon despite multiple different PCR primer
designs and PCR attempts.
Subject diagnostic cost analysis
For determination of charges, all charges related to testing for the purpose
of diagnosis were collected, including both in-patient and out-patient
testing, brain MRIs, and EEGs. We determined, both manually and by
computer search, all lab and radiology testing related to diagnosis. Tests
included general and disease screening labs, as well as disease-specific
testing (for example, respectively: blood chemistry, hemoglobin; chromo-
some karyotype; gene testing). Tests related to clinical patient care (such as
monitoring of drug levels) and professional fees were not included.
Charges for each test were only included for the first instance of that test
being obtained. However, we did include charges for repeat MRIs and
repeat EEGs. PCH is part of Intermountain Healthcare, and complete charge
data was extracted for each subject from the electronic data warehouse
and were standardized to 2013 constant US dollars.54
