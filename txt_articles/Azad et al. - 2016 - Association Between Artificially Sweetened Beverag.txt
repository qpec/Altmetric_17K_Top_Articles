IMPORTANCE The consumption of artificial sweeteners has increased substantially in recent
decades, including among pregnant women. Animal studies suggest that exposure to artificial
sweeteners in utero may predispose offspring to develop obesity; however, to our
knowledge, this has never been studied in humans.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether maternal consumption of artificially sweetened beverages
during pregnancy is associated with infant body mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared]).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study included 3033 mother-infant dyads
from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study, a
population-based birth cohort that recruited healthy pregnant women from 2009 to 2012.
Women completed dietary assessments during pregnancy, and their infants’BMI was
measured at 1 year of age (n = 2686; 89% follow-up). Statistical analysis for this study used
data collected after the first year of follow-up, which was completed in October 2013. The
data analysis was conducted in August 2015.
EXPOSURES Maternal consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and sugar-sweetened
beverages during pregnancy, determined by a food frequency questionnaire.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Infant BMI z score and risk of overweight at 1 year of age,
determined from objective anthropometric measurements and defined according to World
Health Organization reference standards.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age of the 3033 pregnant women was 32.4 (4.7) years, and their
mean (SD) BMI was 24.8 (5.4). The mean (SD) infant BMI z score at 1 year of age was 0.19
(1.05), and 5.1% of infants were overweight. More than a quarter of women (29.5%)
consumed artificially sweetened beverages during pregnancy, including 5.1% who reported
daily consumption. Compared with no consumption, daily consumption of artificially
sweetened beverages was associated with a 0.20-unit increase in infant BMI z score
(adjusted 95% CI, 0.02-0.38) and a 2-fold higher risk of infant overweight at 1 year of age
(adjusted odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.23-3.88). These effects were not explained by maternal
BMI, diet quality, total energy intake, or other obesity risk factors. There were no comparable
associations for sugar-sweetened beverages.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, we provide the first human evidence that
maternal consumption of artificial sweeteners during pregnancy may influence infant BMI.
Given the current epidemic of childhood obesity and widespread use of artificial sweeteners,
further research is warranted to confirm our findings and investigate the underlying biological
mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of informing evidence-based dietary recommendations
for pregnant women.

T
heincidenceofchildhoodobesityhasmorethandoubled
in the last 30 years.1 One-third of children in developed
countries are now overweight or obese,2 putting them
atincreasedriskforcardiometabolicdiseaseandmentalhealth
disorders.3 With more than 20% of preschool children classi-
fied as overweight or obese,1 it is clear that obesity is rooted in
earlylife.Evidencefrombothhumanandanimalstudiesshows
that metabolism, endocrine pathways, and weight gain trajec-
tories are “programmed” during early development,4 and pre-
natal nutrition plays a key role in this process.5
Added sugar intake is strongly associated with obesity and
relatedcomorbidities,promptingpopulation-widerecommen-
dations to reduce sugar consumption.6 As a result, sugar re-
placements or nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) have become
increasingly popular, with more than 50% of Americans re-
porting NNS consumption in recent surveys and cohort
studies.7 Although few data are available for pregnant women
in the United States, cohort studies from Norway8 and
Denmark9 have found that more than 30% of women report
consumingartificiallysweetenedbeverages(ASBs)duringpreg-
nancy. Despite the widespread and increasing consumption of
NNSs,10 their long-term effect on human health is poorly un-
derstood, and current intake recommendations are unclear,
particularly for pregnant women and young children. The
American Dietetic Association states that NNSs are safe to con-
sume during pregnancy and childhood within acceptable daily
intakes,11 while the US Institute of Medicine makes no spe-
cificrecommendationforpregnantwomenbutcautionsagainst
NNS use in children, citing a paucity of evidence for the ad-
verse long-term health effects of NNS exposure in early life.12
AgrowingbodyofliteraturesuggeststhatchronicNNScon-
sumption may paradoxically increase the risk of obesity and
metabolic diseases.13 Proposed mechanisms for this associa-
tion include alteration of glucose metabolism,14 disruption of
gut microbiota,15 or dysregulation of satiety and caloric
compensation.16 However,thisevidencehasbeengeneratedin

dicate that NNS consumption during pregnancy may predis-
pose offspring to develop obesity and metabolic syndrome,18
but to our knowledge, this has never been studied in humans.

We undertook an observational study of mother-infant dy-
ads from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Develop-
ment (CHILD) birth cohort to determine the association of ASB
consumption during pregnancy and infant body mass index
(BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared]) in the first year of life.
Methods
Study Design and Population
WeaccesseddatafromtheCHILDStudy,anationalpopulation-
based birth cohort of 3542 families across 4 sites in Canada.22
Women with singleton pregnancies were enrolled between
2009 and 2012 and remained eligible if they delivered a
healthy, full-term infant (>35 weeks’gestation with no con-
genital abnormalities). For the current study, we included 3033
mother-infant dyads who completed the prenatal dietary as-
sessment, of which 2686 (89%) had complete outcome data
for infant BMI at 1 year of age and 2413 (80%) had complete
data for infant BMI and all essential covariates (maternal BMI
and other potential confounders identified through bivariate
screening). There was no difference in maternal consump-
tion of sweetened beverages, infant BMI, or essential covari-
ates among dyads with complete data compared with all eli-
gible dyads (eTable 1 in the Supplement). This study was
approved by the University of Manitoba Human Research Eth-
ics Board. Written informed consent was obtained from moth-
ers during enrollment.
Maternal Dietary Assessment
MaternaldietwasdocumentedintheCHILDStudyusingavali-
dated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)23,24 administered
inthesecondor(usually)thirdtrimesterofpregnancy.TheFFQ
was modified to address usual food intakes during the cur-
rent pregnancy. Intake of ASBs was determined from re-
ported consumption of “diet soft drinks or pop” (1 serv-
ing = 12 oz or 1 can) and “artificial sweetener added to tea or
coffee” (1 serving = 1 packet). Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB)
intake was similarly determined from consumption of “regu-
lar soft drinks or pop” (1 serving = 12 oz or 1 can) and “sugar
or honey added to tea or coffee” (1 serving = 1 teaspoon or 1
packet). Following the methods of Maslova et al,20 beverage
intakes were classified according to the number of servings
per week as never, fewer than 1 per month, 1 or more per
week, 2 to 6 per week, or 1 or more per day. Total energy
intake (kilocalories per day) and the Healthy Eating Index25
score were derived from FFQ data using food composition
tables from the Nutrition Coding Center nutrient database
(University of Minnesota). The Healthy Eating Index25 is a
measure of diet quality in terms of conformance with the
2010 Dietary Guidelines from the US Department of Agricul-
ture; it has 12 components addressing dietary adequacy (9
components) and moderation (3 components), with a maxi-
mum score of 100.
Key Points
Question Does maternal consumption of artificially sweetened
beverages during pregnancy influence infant body composition?
Findings In this population-based birth cohort of 3033
mother-infant dyads, maternal consumption of artificially
sweetened beverages during pregnancy was significantly
associated with infant body mass index at 1 year of age. After
controlling for maternal obesity and diet quality, daily artificially
sweetened beverage consumption was associated with a 0.2-unit
increase in infant body mass index z score and a 2-fold higher risk
of overweight.
Meaning Exposure to artificial sweeteners in utero may
contribute to the development of childhood obesity.

Infant BMI
At 1 year of age (mean [SD] age, 12.5 [1.5] months), infants were
weighed to the nearest 0.1 kg and measured to the nearest 0.1
cm by trained study staff according to a standardized proto-
col during a CHILD Study clinical assessment. Age- and sex-
specific BMI-for-age z scores and weight-for-length z scores
were calculated according to the 2006 World Health Organi-
zation standards using their “igrowup” package for SAS (SAS
Institute).26 Infants with BMI z scores exceeding the 97th per-
centile were classified as overweight.27
Covariates
Infant sex, birth weight, and gestational age and maternal age
weredocumentedfromhospitalrecords.MaternalBMIwascal-
culated from measured height and self-reported prepreg-
nancy weight (n = 1845), estimated from measured weight at
1 year after birth if mothers could not recall their prepreg-
nancy weight (n = 868), or imputed by multiple imputation if
neithermeasurewasavailable(n = 320).Validationagainstpre-
natal health records (n = 224) showed that prepregnancy
weight was slightly underestimated by maternal recall (mean
difference, −1.0 kg; 95% CI, −1.5 to −0.4) and slightly overes-
timated by measured weight at 1 year after birth (mean differ-
ence, +1.3 kg; 95% CI, 0.5-2.2). Maternal education and pre-
natal smoking were ascertained by a questionnaire during
pregnancy. Education was dichotomized (postsecondary de-
gree: yes or no), and mothers were considered prenatal smok-
ers if they reported current smoking or quitting smoking at any
time during their pregnancy. Maternal diabetes during preg-
nancy (preexisting or gestational) was determined from hos-
pital records and by maternal report. Breastfeeding and
timing of the introduction of solid foods were reported by a
standardized questionnaire at 3, 6, and 12 months after birth.
Duration of breastfeeding in the first year was evaluated as a
continuous variable (age in months at cessation of breastfeed-
ing, or “12 months” if still breastfeeding after 1 year).
Statistical Analysis
The distribution of covariates across categories of beverage in-
take was examined by univariate analysis using the χ2 test for
binary variables or 1-way analysis of variance for continuous
variables. Multivariable regression was used to investigate as-
sociations between maternal sweetened beverage intake dur-
ingpregnancyandinfantBMIzscore(linearregression)orover-
weight (logistic regression) at 1 year of age. Models included
both types of sweetened beverages and were adjusted for in-
fant sex and potential confounders, including known or sus-
pected risk factors for weight gain in addition to those iden-
tifiedinunivariateanalyses.Resultsarepresentedascrudeand
adjusted β estimates (βs and adjusted βs [aβs]) and odds ra-
tios (ORs and adjusted ORs [aORs]) with 95% CIs. Stratified
analyses were planned a priori to determine whether ASB as-
sociations differed by infant sex, maternal overweight, or
breastfeeding duration; intermediate ASB intake categories
were combined to conserve power, and heterogeneity across
strata was evaluated by a likelihood ratio test comparing re-
gression models with and without interaction terms. All tests
were 2-sided, and statistical significance was considered at
P < .05.Analyseswereconductedformother-infantdyadswith
complete data (n = 2413) and confirmed in the full cohort fol-
lowing multiple imputation of missing data (N = 3033). Mul-
tiple imputation (20 imputed data sets) was performed with
fully conditional specification (chained equations) using all es-
sential covariates and the following auxiliary variables: study
site,gestationalage,maternalage,andrace/ethnicity.Allanaly-
ses were performed using SAS version 9.4.
Results
Among 2413 mother-infant dyads with complete data (eTable
1intheSupplement),themean(SD)maternalagewas32.5(4.6)
years, and the mean (SD) maternal BMI was 24.8 (5.4); 78.2%
of mothers had a postsecondary degree, 7.9% smoked during
pregnancy, and 5.8% had diabetes (4.4% developed gesta-
tional diabetes and 1.4% had preexisting diabetes). The mean
(SD) infant BMI z score at 1 year of age was 0.19 (1.05), and 5.1%
of infants were overweight. Overall, 29.5% of mothers con-
sumed ASBs during pregnancy, including 5.1% who reported
daily consumption, while 77.2% consumed SSBs, including
23.4% who reported daily consumption (Table 1).
The distribution of covariates across categories of sweet-
ened beverage intake is shown in Table 1. Both ASB and SSB
consumption were associated with maternal smoking, higher
maternal BMI, lower maternal diet quality, and shorter breast-
feeding duration. Consumption of ASBs was further associ-
ated with earlier introduction of solid foods, while SSB con-
sumption was associated with lower maternal education and
higher total energy intake. Despite significantly reduced SSB
consumption, women who frequently consumed ASBs did not
have lower total energy intake. Women with diabetes had
higher ASB intake and lower SSB intake.
Associations of maternal consumption of ASBs and SSBs
during pregnancy with infant BMI z scores at 1 year of age are
shown in Table 2 and Figure, A. The highest BMI z scores were
observed among infants born to mothers reporting daily con-
sumptionofASBs(mean[SD],0.55 [1.01]vs0.17 [1.04]fordaily
consumers vs nonconsumers; β, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.57). This
associationwasattenuatedafteradjustingformaternalBMIand
furtherattenuatedafteradjustingforadditionalcovariates(total
maternal energy intake, diet quality, smoking, diabetes, edu-
cation, infant sex, birth weight, breastfeeding duration, and in-
troduction of solid foods). In fully adjusted models, daily ASB
consumption remained significantly associated with higher
infant BMI z scores (aβ, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02-0.41). Consump-
tionofSSBswasnotassociatedwithinfantBMIzscores(β,0.11;

lowing multiple imputation of missing data (Table 2), and simi-
lar patterns of association were found for weight-for-length z
scores (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

come of infant overweight at 1 year of age (Table 3; Figure, B).

fants born to mothers reporting daily consumption of ASBs

Stratified analyses were conducted to explore whether the
observed associations of maternal ASB consumption and in-

is associated with higher infant BMI and an increased risk of
infant overweight at 1 year of age. Infant birth weight was not
affected, suggesting that maternal ASB consumption influ-
enced postnatal weight gain rather than fetal growth. Com-
pared with no ASB consumption during pregnancy, daily ASB
consumption was associated with a 0.2-unit increase in in-
fant BMI z score and a 2-fold increased risk of infant over-
weight at 1 year. These associations were independent of ma-
ternalBMI,diabetes,totalenergyintake,dietquality,andother
known obesity risk factors. No comparable associations were
identified for SSB consumption.
To our knowledge, this is the first human study to evalu-
ate the association of maternal sweetened beverage consump-
tion during pregnancy and infant BMI. Increasing evidence
shows that a predisposition to metabolic disease may be ac-
quired or “programmed” early in life.4,5 This has been dem-
onstrated in both human and animal studies in which off-
spring of mothers with high caloric intake are at increased risk
of developing metabolic conditions later in life.28,29 Interest-
ingly, rodent studies have shown that maternal NNS consump-
tion in pregnancy also predisposes offspring to obesity, with
NNS-exposed offspring exhibiting stronger preferences for
sweet foods, increased postnatal weight gain, altered lipid pro-
files, and increased insulin resistance in adulthood.30-32 To our
knowledge, our results provide the first human evidence to
support these findings, suggesting that prenatal NNS expo-
sure may contribute to infant weight gain and early child-
hood obesity.
Our study confirms previous research showing that ASB
consumptionisassociatedwithobesity,diabetes,smoking,and
poor diet quality,33,34 all of which are established maternal
risk factors for obesity in offspring.35,36 Maternal ASB con-
sumption was also correlated with 2 additional risk factors for
childhood obesity: shorter breastfeeding duration and earlier

introduction of solid foods.36,37 Importantly, controlling for
these factors did not explain the observed association be-
tween maternal consumption of ASBs during pregnancy and
infant BMI at 1 year of age, suggesting an independent effect
of in utero exposure to artificial sweeteners.
WeexaminedeffectsfromASBconsumptioninseveralpre-
defined subgroups. As expected, overweight mothers re-
ported higher ASB consumption and their infants had higher
BMI z scores on average; however, effects from ASB consump-
tion were similar in normal-weight and overweight mothers.
Our sex-stratified analyses revealed that effects from ASB
consumption were only seen in male infants, consistent with
findings by Collison et al31 in which aspartame exposure com-
mencing in utero was associated with excess weight gain in
male but not female mice. Sex specificity has been reported
for other obesogenic exposures in early life, with males being
disproportionately affected by maternal smoking,38 antibi-
otic exposure,39,40 and formula feeding.41 This sexual dimor-
phism may be related to sex differences in gut microbiota,42
which contribute to host metabolism and weight gain.43 Our
findings may support this intriguing hypothesis because
NNSs have been shown to modify gut microbiota,15 although
this has not yet been demonstrated for prenatal NNS expo-
sure in humans.
We also performed stratified analyses according to breast-
feeding duration because a recent study showed that NNSs are
commonly detected in human milk,44 indicating another pos-
sible route of early-life NNS exposure. However, we found that
effects from ASB consumption were confined to infants who
were breastfed for shorter durations, indicating that NNS ex-
posure through lactation likely does not explain the ob-
served associations with infant BMI. In fact, our results sug-
gest that breastfeeding may mitigate the potentially adverse
effects of NNS exposure in utero, although we were under-
powered to definitively test this interaction and we lacked
information on post partum NNS consumption.
Interestingly, in contrast to our findings for ASB consump-
tion, we found that SSB consumption during pregnancy was
not associated with infant BMI. These results support the hy-
pothesis that NNSs are responsible for the observed effects
rather than other beverage ingredients or additives, such as
caffeine or artificial coloring. There is a paucity of human
data on the effects of SSB intake during pregnancy,45
although animal studies indicate that high maternal sucrose
or fructose intake have adverse metabolic effects on
offspring.29,45 Fur-ther human research is warranted to
explore the potential metabolic effects of maternal SSB con-
sumption during pregnancy.
The major strengths of our study are the standardized pro-
spectiveevaluationofmaternalsweetenedbeverageconsump-
tionduringpregnancyandtheobjectivemeasurementofinfant
BMIinalargepopulation-representativecohortofmother-infant
dyads. A limitation of our study is the potential for measure-
ment error in self-reported dietary outcomes because our FFQ
hasnotbeenspecificallyvalidatedforbeverageintakes.Wealso
couldnotdistinguishbetweendifferenttypesofNNSsoraccount
for NNSs in solid foods. Although misclassification is always a
concern with FFQs for dietary assessment, these tools gener-
allydifferentiatewellbetweenlowandhighconsumers,andany
misclassification is expected to be nondifferential, leading to
anunderestimationoftrueeffectestimates.However,onecan-
not rule out differential reporting of consumption of ASBs and
SSBs between normal-weight and overweight or obese moth-
ers.Anotherpotentiallimitationconcernstheuncertaintyabout
the best anthropometric measure of body fat in infants, with
Canadian authorities favoring weight-for-length over BMI z
scores for infants younger than 2 years.27 At the same time,
World Health Organization and European authorities pro-
mote the use of BMI as defined by the World Health Organi-
zation Multicenter Growth Reference Study26 for all ages.46
Moreover, a large (N = 15 488) longitudinal North American
study47 of both measures at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age
has confirmed their equivalence as predictors of obesity risk
at school entry. Finally, as with all observational studies, we
cannot exclude the possibility that our results may be influ-
enced by residual and unmeasured confounding factors, al-
though we clinical for a number of important factors, includ-
ingmaternalBMI,smoking,education,totalenergyintake,diet
quality, breastfeeding duration, and early introduction of solid
foods.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, our results provide the first human evi-
dence that artificial sweetener consumption during preg-
nancy may increase the risk of early childhood overweight.
Given the current epidemic of childhood obesity1,2 and the
widespread consumption of artificial sweeteners,7,10 further
research is warranted to replicate our findings in other co-
horts, evaluate specific NNS and longer-term outcomes, and
study the underlying biological mechanisms.
