IMPORTANCE Demonstrating that endothelial cell loss following Descemet stripping
automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) is independent of donor cornea preservation
time (PT) could increase the pool of corneal tissue available for keratoplasty.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether endothelial cell loss 3 years after successful DSAEK is
related to PT.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter, double-masked, randomized clinical trial
included 40 clinical sites (70 surgeons) in the United States, with donor corneas provided by
23 US eye banks. A total of 945 eyes of 769 participants were included in the Cornea
Preservation Time Study that had not experienced graft failure 3 years after DSAEK,
performed primarily for Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (96% of the cohort). The study
was conducted from April 16, 2012, to June 5, 2017.
INTERVENTIONS DSAEK with random assignment of a donor cornea with PT of 0 to 7 days
(0-7d PT) or 8 to 14 days (8-14d PT).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Endothelial cell density (ECD) at 3 years determined by a
central image analysis reading center from clinical specular or confocal central endothelial
images.
RESULTS Nine hundred forty-five eyes of 769 participants (median age, 70 years [range, 42-90
years], 60.8% women, 93.0% white) in the Cornea Preservation Time Study that had not
experienced graft failure 3 years after DSAEK were included. At the initial eye bank tissue
screening, mean (SD) central ECD was 2746 (297) cells/mm2 in the 0-7d PT group (n = 485) and
2723 (284) cells/mm2 in the 8-14d PT group (n = 460). At 3 years, the mean (SD) ECD
decreased from baseline by 37% (21%) in the 0-7d PT group and 40% (22%) in the 8-14d PT
group to 1722 (626) cells/mm2 and 1642 (631) cells/mm2, respectively (mean difference, 73
cells/mm2; 95% CI, 8-138 cells/mm2; P = .03). When analyzed as a continuous variable (days),
longer PT was associated with lower ECD (mean difference by days, 15 cells/mm2; 95% CI, 4-26
cells/mm2; P = .006). Endothelial cell loss (ECL) was comparable from 4 to 13 days’PT (n = 878;
36%-43% when tabulated by day). Available extension study ECD results at 4 years mirrored
those at 3 years in the 203 eyes in the 0-7d PT group (mean [SD] ECD, 1620 [673] cells/mm2
and mean [SD] ECL, 41% [23%]) and 209 eyes in the 8-14d PT group (mean [SD] ECD, 1537
[683] cells/mm2 and mean [SD] ECL, 44% [23%]) (mean difference, 112 cells/mm2; 95% CI,
5-219 cells/mm2; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although ECL 3 years after Descemet stripping automated
endothelial keratoplasty is greater with longer PT, the effect of PT on ECL is comparable from
4 to 13 days’PT.

 T
he corneal endothelium is critical for deturgescence of
the corneal stroma with its barrier and pump func-
tions.1,2 Although central endothelial cell density (ECD)
decreases with age,3 it decreases at a higher rate with corneal
conditions, such as Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy,4 and
following cataract surgery.5-7 Failure of the corneal endothe-
lium to recover from endothelial cell damage is due to its lim-
ited ability to divide.8 If central ECD falls below a critical level
with an insufficient number of endothelial cells and their as-
sociated sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump
sites to dehydrate the stroma,2 the cornea swells, vision de-
creases, and keratoplasty is then indicated. The Cornea Do-
nor Study and its ancillary study, the Specular Microscopy An-
cillary Study, which evaluated the effect of donor age on graft
success and endothelial cell loss (ECL) following penetrating
keratoplasty (PKP),9,10 demonstrated the importance of ECL
inestimatinglong-termgraftsurvival.FiveyearsafterPKP,graft
success rates were similar with older and younger donor age,9
but ECL was greater with corneas from older donors com-
paredwithyoungerdonors.11ThisECLdifferenceat5yearspre-
saged a higher graft failure rate in the older donor age group
by 10 years.10 In addition, ECD at 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years
was associated at each time point with subsequent graft fail-
ure, irrespective of donor age.12
The Cornea Preservation Time Study (CPTS) was de-
signed to determine whether the success of Descemet strip-
ping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) performed
for corneal conditions associated with endothelial failure is re-
lated to donor cornea preservation time (PT). With the Cor-
nea Donor Study and the results of studies examining ECL fol-
lowing DSAEK13-15 in mind, the determination of ECL and its
association with PT following DSAEK was considered an im-
portant secondary outcome in designing the CPTS protocol,16
particularly since there have been few clinical studies assess-
ing the effect of PT on ECL following keratoplasty with hypo-
thermic (2°C-8°C) storage solutions.17-19 None of these stud-
ies examined the clinical performance of these solutions for
the full 14 days approved by the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration. This report complements the CPTS article20 examin-
ing the association between PT and graft success following
DSAEK by describing the effect of PT on long-term ECL fol-
lowing this procedure.
Methods
Participants were enrolled at 40 clinical sites and donor cor-
neas were provided by 23 eye banks across the United States.16
Enrolled CPTS participants were aged 42 to 90 years (me-
dian, 70 years) with a corneal disease associated with endo-
thelial dysfunction, including Fuchs endothelial corneal dys-
trophy (94% of eyes) and pseudophakic or aphakic corneal
edema (6% of eyes). Eyes were randomly assigned to receive
a donor cornea with PT of 0 to 7 days (0-7d PT group) or 8 to
14 days (8-14d PT group); for participants with both eyes eli-
gible, the first eye was assigned randomly to a PT group and
the second eye was assigned to the other PT group. The 1330
eyes completing surgery with a CPTS-assigned cornea were
considered the study eyes. These CPTS-assigned corneas were
from donors aged 12 to 75 years (median age, 61 years) with a
minimum eye bank–measured central ECD of 2300 cells/
mm2 and a median PT of 6 days in the 0-7d PT group and 11
days in the 8-14d PT group. Under specific authorization from
the Eye Bank Association of America, clinical investigators and
participantsweremaskedtoallcharacteristicsofthedonorcor-
nea, except for storage solution (Optisol-GS; Bausch and Lomb
or Life 4°C; Numedis), residual bed thickness following lamel-
lar dissection, and observations captured during donor tis-
sue preparation; no Eusol (Alchimia) was used. Preoperative
management, surgical technique, and postoperative care, in-
cluding prescription of medications, were provided accord-
ing to each investigator’
s routine. Only eyes classified as a graft
success at 3 years, as defined in our companion article,20 and
with analyzable 3-year specular or confocal microscopic im-
ages were included in the ECD analyses reported herein. The
study was conducted from April 16, 2012, to June 5, 2017.
Details of the CPTS protocol have been published16 and
are available in Supplement 2. The protocol was approved by
institutional review boards governing each investigational
site (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1), and individual partici-
pants gave written informed consent to participate in the
study. Participants received financial compensation at each
protocol visit.
Endothelial Imaging and Image Analysis
The Corneal Image Analysis Reading Center at Case Western
Reserve University and University Hospitals Eye Institute
(CIARC) in Cleveland, Ohio, served as the central reading cen-
ter for endothelial image analysis to determine ECD and also
was responsible for quality-control measures at the eye banks
and clinical sites. Each specular or confocal microscope at eye
banks and clinical sites used in the study underwent a pre-
study external calibration determination and image quality
assessment16;atsiteswithmultipleinstruments,eachwascali-
brated. This prestudy instrument certification was designed
to ascertain the specific magnification and image quality for
each instrument so that ECD could accurately be measured by
the CIARC. In addition, any replacement microscope in-
stalled during the study was certified before use in the trial.
Key Points
Question What is the relationship between cornea preservation
time and endothelial cell loss 3 years after successful Descemet
stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty?
Findings In a randomized clinical trial evaluating 945 eyes with
graft success, endothelial cell loss was 37% with preservation time
0 to 7 days and 40% with preservation time 8 to 14 days, with
mean endothelial cell density of 1722 and 1642 cells/mm2,
respectively, at 3 years.
Meaning Although endothelial cell loss 3 years after Descemet
stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty is greater with
longer preservation time, the effect of preservation time on
endothelial cell loss is comparable from 4 to 13 days of
preservation time.

 The eye banks used specular microscopes for endothelial
imaging (HAI Laboratories Inc [n = 7]; Konan Medical Inc
[n = 32]). A contact or noncontact specular microscope (Ko-
nan Medical Inc [n = 37]; Tomey Corporation USA [n = 4]) or
confocal microscope (Nidek Inc [n = 16]) was used at the clini-
cal sites. All eye bank and clinical site personnel capturing im-
ages were trained and certified to obtain good to excellent im-
age quality according to the protocol related to endothelial
imaging.
Following donor cornea procurement, eye banks ob-
tained 1 to 3 initial specular images of the central donor cor-
nea endothelium after their usual procedure of warming the
donor tissue to room temperature and then determined ECD
by their usual analysis method (referred to as screening ECD).
This assessment was not standardized, since it was per-
formed at a time when the eye bank did not yet know whether
the donor cornea would be assigned to a CPTS recipient. If a
donor cornea was assigned to the CPTS, eye banks also ob-
tained 3 preoperative study images of the central endothe-
lium either after lamellar dissection or, if the donor cornea was
to be prepared by the surgeon, prior to shipment. Before pre-
operative images were obtained, the donor cornea was again
allowed to warm to room temperature so that the best-
quality images could be obtained.21 Postoperative specular or
confocal microscopic images of the central corneal endothe-
lium of the graft were obtained at 6 months and then 1, 2, and
3 years as long as a participant remained in follow-up without
experiencing graft failure or undergoing regrafting. Sites were
requested to retake images of poor technical quality when pos-
sible and were provided specific advice on quality improve-
ment techniques. Images were also obtained at 4 and 5 years
for participants who consented to extended observation.
ECD Determination
Preoperative donor and postoperative recipient images were
evaluated for quality and ECD by the CIARC. Details of CIARC
procedures have been previously described, including reader
training and certification, image-quality grading, image cali-
bration, variable frame analysis for ECD determination, and
adjudication procedures for image-quality and ECD deter-
mination.11,22 Briefly, image quality was assessed as analyz-
able or nonanalyzable by 2 independent readers and deter-
minedbyathirdadjudicator(oneofus,B.B.)wheneitherreader
found the quality to be nonanalyzable. The ECD of all analyz-
able images was independently determined by 2 readers using
the variable frame analysis method.23 This method was se-
lected for the CPTS so that the maximal number of available
cells with clear centers and borders could be analyzed. If the
ECDs determined by the 2 readers differed by 5.0% or more, a
third independent determination of ECD was made by an ad-
judicator. Final ECD was the mean of all ECDs that were within
5%ofeachother.Readersweremaskedtoallinformationabout
the donor corneas and study participants. Throughout the
study, the CPTS Data Management and Analysis Center (Jaeb
Center for Health Research, Tampa, Florida) selected eye bank
and clinical images for additional masked image-quality grad-
ing and ECD determination to assess both intraobserver and
interobserver variability (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).
Statistical Analysis
The eye bank–determined screening ECD was considered the
baseline value for all analyses evaluating the effect of PT, in-
cluding calculations of ECL, since the preoperative ECD was
measured after the donor corneas had already been pre-
served either 0 to 7 days or 8 to 14 days. The primary analysis
to assess the effect of PT on 3-year ECD was conducted with a
mixed linear model adjusting for baseline ECD, corneal diag-
nosis, and potential confounders, including storage solution,
preparation by eye bank vs surgeon, and accounting for cor-
related data from participants with 2 study eyes or 2 corneas
from the same donor. Other potential confounders were evalu-
ated but not included in the final model (recipient and donor
age, recipient and donor race, presence of glaucoma, pres-
ence of corneal vessels, history of smoking, time from lamel-
lar dissection to surgery, and donor rim culture result). Poten-
tial confounders from univariate models with P < .10 were
evaluated in a multivariate model, keeping factors with P < .01
following a backward selection process. Random effects were
modeled to account for correlated data from fellow eyes of the
same participant and correlated data from fellow corneas of
the same donors. Preplanned secondary analyses were per-
formed treating PT as categorical (predefined categories of 0-4
days, 5-7 days, 8-11 days, and 12-14 days) and as a continuous
variable (days from initial preservation to surgery). Sensitiv-
ity analyses were performed using multiple imputation24 to
impute the missing or nonanalyzable 3-year ECD of partici-
pants with a surviving graft at 3 years. Statistical models ac-
counting for selective dropout due to graft failure, previously
applied to Cornea Donor Study PKP data,25 could not be used
owing to the overall low failure rate.
In another preplanned analysis, a repeated-measures least
squares regression longitudinal model was fit using all avail-
able images obtained at screening, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3
years, adjusting for corneal diagnosis and correlated data as
described above. Preservation time was evaluated as both con-
tinuous and categorical. Sensitivity analyses were performed
using multiple imputation24 to impute ECD at all missing time
points for participants with a surviving graft at 3 years, with
similar results.
Analysesof4-yearimagedataparalleledtheprimary3-year
analysis for participants with a surviving graft at 4 years. There
were too few 5-year images for meaningful statistical analy-
ses. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software,
version 94 (SAS Institute). All P values are 2-sided and con-
sidered significant at <.05.
Results
Nine hundred forty-five eyes of 769 participants (median age,
70 years [range, 42-90 years], 60.8% women, 93.0% white)
were included. Of the 675 study eyes undergoing DSAEK that
were assigned to the 0-7d PT group and 655 assigned to the
8-14d PT group, 493 (73.0%) and 472 (72.1%) eyes, respec-
tively, had a clear recipient stroma, functioning graft, and ECD
images at 3 years. Of these 3-year image sets (3 images per set),
8 (1.6%) and 12 (2.5%) sets, respectively, were nonanalyzable

 owing to poor image quality or insufficient number of cells for
analysis.22Thus,theprimaryECDanalysiscohortincluded485
eyes in the 0-7d PT group and the 460 eyes in the 8-14d PT
group (Figure 1). The recipient and donor baseline character-
istics of these eyes were similar to the characteristics of the full
CPTS cohort (eTable 2 and eTable 3 in Supplement 1).
In the primary ECD analysis cohort, the initial mean (SD)
eye bank screening ECD was 2746 (297) cells/mm2 in the 0-7d
PTgroupand2723(284)cells/mm2inthe8-14dPTgroup.Mean
preoperative ECD (determined by CIARC) was 2745 (354) cells/
mm2 and 2764 (374) cells/mm2, respectively.
At 3 years, mean (SD) ECL decreased from baseline by 37%
(21%) in the 0-7d PT group and 40% (22%) in the 8-14d PT
group, resulting in a mean (SD) 3-year ECD of 1722 (626) cells/
mm2 and 1642 (631) cells/mm2, respectively (mean differ-
ence, 73 cells/mm2; 95% CI, 8-138 cells/mm2; P = .03). Analy-
sis was adjusted for screening ECD, corneal diagnosis, and
other confounding factors as described above (Table). Re-
sults were similar when 3-year ECD was imputed for the ad-
ditional 68 and 48 eyes with graft success at 3 years, but with-
out analyzable 3-year images (P = .02). In both PT groups, the
majority of ECL occurred in the first 6 months after DSAEK
(Figure 2A), with mean ECL of 24% (19%) in the 0-7d PT group
and 26% (20%) in the 8-14d PT group at that time.
In preplanned secondary analyses, there was greater ECL
with longer PT (P = .006 treating PT as continuous [days] with
mean difference by days, 15 cells/mm2; 95% CI, 4-26 cells/mm2

callysignificantgreaterECLwithlongerPT,thiscompanionECL
study also supports the use of corneas with a PT up to 11 days,
because there was little clinical difference in ECL over the 4-
to 13-day PT range. The sample size was too small for a sepa-

Thereisconsiderableliteratureonlong-termECLfollowing

generally found between 30% and 40% ECL at 3 years and ap-

of 53% with high variability (range, 7.5%-89%) at 5 years in 53
eyes,13 which was lower than observed in eyes that underwent

rejection showing a mean ECL of 31% with high variability (SD,

suringthatthemeanECLoverallof39%at3yearsintheCPTSwith

Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of this study included a large sample size, standard-
ization of imaging techniques and ECD determination, highly
reproducible image analyses, and masking of the surgeons and
imaging analysts to PT. A limitation of all longitudinal post-
graft ECL studies is that failed grafts are no longer available for
ECD measurements and so the results apply only to success-
ful grafts. Although we were unable to complete a sensitivity
analysiscontrollingforthisselectiveexclusionandcannotcon-
firm its impact, we suspect that any bias is negligible owing
to the small number of failures and are reassured that other
studies with higher failure rates found no meaningful differ-
ence when these methods were applied.25,31 In interpreting the
CPTS results, it is also important to recognize that almost all
participants had Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy, and the
results may not apply to DSAEK performed for other condi-
tions, including failed grafts or pseudophakic or aphakic cor-
neal edema associated with tube shunts and anterior cham-
ber intraocular lenses. The findings also may not apply to PKP,
which has a different pattern of ECL than DSAEK.25,31
Conclusions
Although there was a statistically significant association be-
tweengreaterECLandlongerPTincorneasthatareclear3years
after DSAEK, ECL was clinically similar among corneas stored
for 4 to 13 days. With a higher frequency of graft failure in the
12- to 14-day PT group as reported in our companion article,20
the findings suggest that donor tissue with PT up to 11 days is
suitable in terms of both graft success and ECL. Donor tissue
stored for 12 to 14 days also may be considered suitable for lo-
gistical reasons, because the DSAEK success rate is high, irre-
spective of PT, although higher ECL in corneas that are clear
at 3 years could portend a higher long-term failure rate.
