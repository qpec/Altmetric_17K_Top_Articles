Aims: In a population-based cohort study we examined the associations between early
adult pre-pregnancy weight change and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
Methods: The study included 3111 women from the 1973–78 cohort of the Australian Longi-
tudinal Study on Women’s Health. These women have been surveyed regularly since 1996.
Women without diabetes and GDM were followed-up between 2003 and 2012. Generalized
estimating equations were used to assess the effect of baseline (1996, mean age 20 years)
and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and the pre-pregnancy weight changes on the
incidence of GDM. The full models were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle
factors.
Results: From 2003 to 2012, 229 GDM cases (4.4%) were reported in 5242 pregnancies.
Relative to normal BMI women, obese women at baseline (RR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.8) and prior
to pregnancy (RR: 2.7, 95% CI: 2.0, 3.6) were at greater risk of GDM. Weight gains prior to
each study pregnancy were strongly associated with increased GDM risk with an adjusted
RR ranging from 2.0 to 2.9. Within under/normal range of BMI, women with a moderate/
high (>2.5%/year) weight gain had 2.7 (95% CI: 1.3, 5.5) times the risk of GDM compared with
women with stable weight.
Conclusions: Early adult weight gain, even within normal BMI range, is an important risk
factor for the development of GDM. Weight gain prevention from early adulthood to prior
to pregnancy appears to be the main strategy to prevent the incidence of GDM.

Introduction
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a state of impaired glu-
cose tolerance recognised for the first time in pregnancy, is
one of the most frequent pregnancy complications associated
with higher maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes [1]. The
prevalence is increasing mainly as a result of the rising
proportion of women with pre-pregnancy obesity, sedentary
lifestyles and advanced maternal age at birth [2,3]. Women
with GDM are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in later
life compared to women without GDM [4].
The cross sectional association between body mass index
(BMI) and GDM is well established [5]. Although evidence of
a
causal
relationship
is
scarce,

 observational studies, the risk of development of GDM ranged
from a two- to fivefold increase for women who were over-
weight and severely obese prior to pregnancy, respectively
[6]. A number of studies [7–10] have also showed that weight
gain over the life course has substantial effect on the develop-
ment of diabetes and other cardiovascular risks in non-
pregnant women and men. However, there are only a few
studies [11,12] of the relationship between early adult pre-
pregnancy weight change and the risk of GDM.
In the life course, young adults (20–29 years of age) are at
higher risk of increased weight gain [13]. Changes in the early
adult pre-pregnancy weight over the reproductive years of
the life course may have more important effect than the imme-
diate pre-pregnancy weight. The women who develop GDM
have been shown to have had nearly a twofold rate of weight
gain prior to pregnancy than non GDM women [11]. Even in a
normal range of BMI, a pre-pregnancy weight gain has been
associated with an elevated risk of GDM [12,14]. Weight gain/
retention between consecutive pregnancies has also been
found to be linked with the increased risk of GDM [14,15]. How-
ever, the existing scarce studies were limited to nursing profes-
sional mothers whose childhood body shape and weight (at
18 years) were reported retrospectively and subsequent adult
weights were collected over a short interval [12]. The other
studies collected weight trajectories in a single retrospective
interview [11] or measured only inter-pregnancy weight
change [14,15] rather than over the reproductive course of life.
These studies were further limited to clinical populations and
lacked adjustment for potential confounders such as diet, and
physical activity, a fact acknowledged by the authors [11].
We therefore primarily aimed to examine whether the
changes in early adult pre-pregnancy weight from baseline
(1996, 18–23 years of age) to 25–30 years of age (2003) and to
each study pregnancy (with children born between 2003 and
2012) are associated with the development of GDM using data
from a broadly representative population-based cohort study
of Australian women. As a secondary objective, we investi-
gated the effect of early adult pre-pregnancy weight change
on the subsequent risk of GDM in women within different
BMI categories.

Subjects, materials and methods
2.1.
Data source and participants
The
Australian
Longitudinal
Study
on
Women’s
Health
(ALSWH) is an ongoing large longitudinal population-based
study examining the health of over 58,000 Australian women.
In 1996, three cohorts of women born in 1973–78 (‘young’,
aged 18–23 at baseline), 1946–51 (‘mid-age’, aged 45–50 at
baseline), and 1921–26 (‘older’, aged 70–75 at baseline) were
randomly selected from the national Medicare health insur-
ance database, which includes all Australian citizens and per-
manent residents. Random samples were drawn within each
age group with oversampling of women in the rural and
remote areas to ensure ongoing sufficient power for statistical
comparisons of the circumstances and health of city and
country women. ALSWH collects self-reported data using
mailed or online surveys for each cohort about every three
years on a rolling basis. Further details of ALSWH are avail-
able elsewhere [16]. Informed consent was obtained from all
participants at each survey, with ethical clearance obtained
from the Human Research Ethics Committees of the Univer-
sity of Newcastle and the University of Queensland.
This study used data from the young (born in 1973–78)
cohort. All women who completed the baseline survey (Sur-
vey 1 [S1]) in 1996 (n = 14,427) were eligible for this study. Fur-
ther, as inclusion criteria, these women needed to have
responded to Survey 2 (S2) and Survey 3 (S3) as well as having
given birth at least once between S3 and Survey 6 (S6). How-
ever, a substantial number of women did not respond to S2
or S3 (n = 4606) and another 4596 women did not report the
birth of a child between S3 and S6. Women who were preg-
nant at S1 (n = 65), S2 (n = 192) and S3 (n = 456) were also
excluded as pre-pregnancy weight was not available in earlier
surveys. Further details are displayed in Fig. 1.
2.2.
BMI and weight change
In this study, early adult baseline and pre-pregnancy BMI as
well as weight changes (between subsequent surveys: S1–S2;
S2–S3; and S1 to each study pregnancy) were the primary
exposures of interest. Self-reported height and weight at S1
were used to calculate baseline BMI and those reported in a
survey prior to each study pregnancy were used to calculate
the pre-pregnancy BMI, and were categorised as underweight
(<18.5), normal (18.50–24.99), overweight (25.00–29.99) and
obese (P30) [17].
Weight change between S1 and S2 was denoted as S2–S1
weight and for weight change between S2 and S3 it was
denoted as S3–S2 weight. Weight change from S1 to each
study pregnancy was calculated as the difference between
weight prior to each study pregnancy and S1 weight.
Further, the annual weight change was calculated by sub-
tracting self-reported weight at successive surveys and divid-
ing by weight at the earlier survey and the number of years
between the surveys (S1 and S2 were 4 years apart, S2 and
S3 were 3 years apart, whereas S1 and study pregnancies were
on average 7 [for those born between S3 and Survey 4 (S4); S1–
S3], 10 [for those born between S4 and Survey 5 (S5); S1–S4],
and 13 [for those born between S5 and S6; S1–S5] years apart).
The annual weight change was categorised as high (>5%),
moderate (>2.5–5%), small (>1.5–2.5%) loss; stable (loss or gain
of up to 1.5%); small (>1.5–2.5%), moderate (>2.5–5%), or high
(>5%) gain [18]. However, very few women had high or moder-
ate weight loss and these were collapsed to a single category
representing ‘loss’ (>1.50%).
2.3.
Ascertainment of GDM
The diagnosis of GDM was self-reported. In S4, GDM was
obtained from the following question ‘‘In the last 3 years,
have you been diagnosed or treated for gestational diabetes
(yes/no)?”, whereas in S5 and S6 GDM was obtained for each
live birth from the following single question; ‘‘were you diag-
nosed or treated for gestational diabetes?” In this study,
women who had history of GDM up to S3 were excluded. Inci-
dence of GDM was defined as new cases between 2003 (S3)
and 2012 (S6).

 In Australia over the study period, 2003–2012, clinical
guidelines recommend a positive screening result for GDM
be made when a 1 h venous plasma glucose level was
P7.8 mmol/l after a 50 g glucose load, or P8.0 mmol/l after
a 75 g glucose load. Diagnosis was confirmed with a 75 g oral
glucose tolerance test (fasting) with a venous plasma glucose
level at 0 h of P5.6 mmol/l and/or at 2 h of P8.0 mmol/l [19].
Recently, in a subpopulation of the ALSWH 1973–78 cohort
(n = 1914), a validation study between self-reported perinatal
outcomes and medical records showed a high level of agree-
ment (>92%), between self-reported physician diagnosed
GDM and the medical record [20].
2.4.
Assessment of covariates
At each survey, data on area of residence (urban, rural/
remote), age (years), marital status (never married, married,
de facto, divorced, separated, widowed), education level (up
to year 12 or equivalent, trade/apprenticeship/certificate/dipl
oma, university/higher degree), parity (nulliparous, parous),
lifestyle factors (smoking, physical activity and alcohol use)
were collected.
Smoking was categorised as never, ex-smoker, or current
smoker. Pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption was categorised
according to the classifications of the National Health and
Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia as non-
drinker, low-risk drinker (614 drinks/week), risky drinker
(15–28 drinks/week) or high-risk drinker (>28 drinks/week)
[21].
Pre-pregnancy physical activity has been derived from
total metabolic equivalent (MET) values which have been
estimated for many activities with values of 3.5, 4 and 7.5,
assigned
for
walking,
moderate
activity
and
vigorous
activity
respectively
and
categorised
as
sedentary/low
(<600 MET min/week), moderate (600–<1200 MET min/week)
or high (P1200 MET min/week) [22]. In addition, a total energy
intake in kilocalories (kcal/day) was assessed at S3.
2.5.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics such as percentages and means with
standard deviations (SD) were used to describe the baseline
characteristics of the study population. Chi-square and
ANOVA tests were used to compare the differences in
baseline pre-pregnancy characteristics of included women
by baseline BMI.
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses, which
account for correlations in repeated pregnancies of a mother
[23], were used to examine the relationships between baseline
(S1, 1996) and pre-pregnancy BMI and weight changes (S1–S2,
S2–S3 and S1 to each study pregnancy) and the risk of devel-
opment of GDM (between S3 and S6). A log-binomial model
was used to estimate risk ratios (RR), the exponentiated
regression coefficients reflecting the association between
the incidence of GDM and the baseline BMI. Similar models
were fitted with other exposures of interest. In each model,
RR with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate
the risk of development of GDM over 9 years of follow up.

 The full models were adjusted for time varying covariates
(area of residence, age, education and lifestyle factors [smok-
ing, alcohol use and physical activity]) reported at the survey
prior to each study pregnancy (S3–5), the reproductive charac-
teristic (parity) reported at the same survey of each study
pregnancy and total energy intake (kcal/day) reported at S3.
Weight change models were further adjusted for baseline
BMI.
In supplemental analyses, weight change models were
repeated in women stratified by baseline BMI and by BMI sta-
tus across all surveys prior to each study pregnancy (for both,
BMI was categorised as under/normal weight; BMI < 25 kg/m2,
overweight/obese; BMI P 25 kg/m2). All statistical analyses
were conducted using Stata software version 12 (College Sta-
tion, TX: Stata Corp LP). In all models a p value <0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant and all statistical tests were
two sided.

Results
A total of 3111 women who reported 5242 pregnancies
between S3 and S6 (mean 1.7 pregnancies per women) were
included. Of these pregnancies, 229 new cases of GDM
(4.4%) were reported. The mean age of women at the baseline
was 20 (SD 1.5) years. About three fifths (58.8%) of women
were urban residents. The majority of women had completed
up to year 12 (66.6%), were never married (82.9%), and were
nulliparous
(97.4%). Among the
study
population,
9.3%,
14.6% and 4.4% of women were underweight, overweight
and obese, respectively. A quarter (25%) were current smokers
and about 43% had sedentary lifestyles/low physical activity
levels.
Women’s demographic (area of residence, age), reproduc-
tive (parity) and lifestyle factors (smoking status, physical
activity and alcohol use) were substantially different by the
baseline BMI categories. The proportion of urban residents
was higher in underweight women but lower in obese
women. Obese women were more likely to be older, parous,
and current smokers (Table 1).
As shown in Fig. 1, 5166 women were reported as lost to
follow up between S1 and S3. Supplemental Table S1 shows
that all baseline characteristics of the women were signifi-
cantly different by their subsequent response status at S3.
Women lost to follow up were younger on average (20.2 vs
20.4 years), less educated (73.6% vs 69.2%), born overseas
(11.2% vs 7.0%), and parous (15.3% vs 7.5%). They were also
more likely to be current smokers (37.3% vs 29.7%) and under-
weight (11.1% vs 9.4%).
Table 2 shows the incidence and adjusted RR of GDM
(between
S3
and
S6)
according
to
baseline
and
pre-
pregnancy BMI and weight change (S1–S2, S2–S3 and S1 to
each study pregnancy) categories. In the fully adjusted model
(Model 2), baseline obesity was associated with a 76% (95% CI:
1.11, 2.80) increased risk of GDM. Pre-pregnancy obesity was
also associated with higher risk of GDM after adjustment for
a range of factors. Women who were obese, on average a year
before the study pregnancy, were 2.68 (95% CI: 1.98, 3.62)
times as likely to develop GDM as compared to normal weight
women.
Weight gain from S1 (mean age; 20) to S2 (mean age; 24) was
found to be significantly associated with the risk of GDM. In a
model adjusted for sociodemographic, reproductive and life-
style factors, women who were categorised as having small,
moderate and high annual weight gains had about 1.48, 1.69
and 2.25 times the risk of GDM over 9 years of follow up, respec-
tively, as compared to women whose weight remained stable.
Further adjustment for baseline BMI did not change the
point estimates substantially. Similarly, weight change from
S2 (mean age; 24) to S3 (mean age; 27) was a significant pre-
dictor of GDM, although the effect sizes were slightly lower
than those for weight change from S1 to S2, and having small
weight gain did not reach statistical significance (RR: 1.27; 95%
CI: 0.86, 1.88).
Weight gain (small, moderate/high) from S1 to each study
pregnancy was also strongly associated with the development
of GDM. There was no statistically significant association
between weight loss (from S1–S2 and S2–S3) and GDM risk,
although RRs were suggesting benefit of weight loss. However,
as few women had weight loss (from S1 to each study preg-
nancy), to retain sufficient numbers, the three weight loss
groups (high, moderate and small) were combined to stable
group.
In stratified analyses based on baseline BMI (Table 3),
weight changes (S1–S2, S2–S3 and S1 to each study pregnancy)
in under/normal weight women revealed similar estimates
(slightly increased for weight changes from S1–S2 and S2–S3
but decreased for S1 to each study pregnancy). In over-
weight/obese women, the effect sizes substantially decreased
and did not reach statistical significance for shorter term
weight gains (S2–S3) as compared to relatively longer term
weight gains (S1 to each study pregnancy).
Our supplementary analysis also demonstrated a statisti-
cally significant association between weight gains from S1
to each study pregnancy and GDM risk in women reporting
under/normal weight across all surveys. Women in the
under/normal BMI range who showed a small weight gain
had 1.94 times risk of GDM, whereas those women who
gained substantial annual body weight (>2.5%) had nearly
threefold risk of GDM compared with that in women with
stable weight (Table 3).

Discussion
We found baseline (mean age 20 years) and pre-pregnancy
obesity (on average approximately a year before a pregnancy)
to be significantly associated with increased GDM risk, after
adjustment for potential confounders. The association was
stronger with the latter as pre-pregnancy obesity is the clos-
est measure to the event of pregnancy. While others have
shown inconsistencies between early adult obesity and latter
GDM risk [11], there is a general consensus in the relation-
ships of pre-pregnancy obesity and GDM risk [6]. The incon-
sistencies might be due to misclassification/recall biases.
Unlike the previous study [11], this study utilized prospec-
tively collected data. Evidence [24] indicates that elapsed time
and BMI status account for such biases. Consistent with our
study, Yeung et al. [12] found an increased risk of GDM in
women who were overweight and obese at the age of 18 years,

 although we did not find an association between baseline
overweight and GDM risk. To elucidate the above cross sec-
tional relationships, we further examined the associations
of the annual weight change and risk of developing GDM.
The annual weight gains from early adulthood (mean age
20 years) to mean age of 24 years and from mean age of 24–
27 years were associated with increased risk of GDM. The
magnitude of the associations are stronger in the earlier
weight gains (from mean age of 20–24 years) than the weight
gains from mean age of 24–27 years. However, much stronger
associations are also found between small, moderate/high
annual weight gains from mean age of 20 years to each study
pregnancy and GDM risk. Our novel findings are independent
of other risk factors of GDM such as age, smoking, alcohol
use, physical activity, energy intake, parity, and the baseline
BMI. This study further confirmed the evidence from earlier
scarce studies [11,12].
We also found that weight loss has no significant effect on
the risk of GDM. However, the estimates were in the direction
that suggested a protective effect. This might be because of
the small number of women with considerable weight loss,
which led us to collapse the categories within the weight loss
groups. It is also possible that women with small/moderate
weight loss may remain overweight or obese. This is in agree-
ment with a previous study where a loss of P5 kg in weight
since late adolescence was not associated with a reduction
in risk of GDM [12].
Stratified analyses, restricted to women with under/nor-
mal BMI range (BMI < 25 kg/m2) at baseline, also showed a
similar risk of development of GDM in women with small,
moderate/high weight gain groups. However, the relationship
between weight change (i.e. from mean age of 24–27 years)
and the risk of GDM in women who were overweight/obese
at baseline did not reach statistical significance, possibly
because of lack of statistical power. Alternatively, short term
weight gain may have a minimal impact. Although we are
unaware of reports assessing the effect of short term weight
gain on the risk of GDM, research has shown that short term
weight change has no association with the subsequent risk of
type 2 diabetes [18].

 gain from mean age of 20 years to each study pregnancy was
associated with higher risk of GDM. Although the previous
studies were limited to inter-pregnancy weight change, a
consistent finding has been reported using large population-
based data. In those studies, in women with normal pre-
pregnancy BMI for both pregnancies, women with a gain of
3 or more BMI units had more than a double risk of GDM in
their second pregnancy [14,15]. Together, these findings sug-
gest that women who are planning to become pregnant need
to stabilize their weight before pregnancy. Further, weight
gain

strategies
should
be
tailored
towards
preventing early adulthood weight gain even in women
within under/normal BMI range.
This finding has important clinical and public health impli-
cations as women within a normal BMI range are often not tar-
geted for weight management. For instance, for a woman
within a normal BMI range of body weight 52 kg with an aver-
age height of 1.66 m, a 2% annual body weight gain over
7 years was associated with an 94% increase in risk of GDM,
whereas for the same woman and duration a 4% annual body
weight gain elevates the risk to nearly threefold as compared
to women with stable annual body weight (Table 3). Women

 who continue to gain weight since early adulthood may expe-
rience a modest insulin resistance progressively, which may
be further exacerbated by pregnancy, although their BMI is
in the normal range. These women might be also in the upper
extreme of healthy weight category or could even be over-
weight/obese during their pregnancies as there was a time
lag between the pre-pregnancy weight report and the actual
pregnancies. It has also been suggested that BMI is a poor indi-
cator of body fat in women with a normal range of BMI, and
this might also explain the excessive risk of GDM in women
with a normal BMI [25]. This finding further supports the argu-
ment for a causal association of adiposity and risk of GDM.
Utilization of a population-based prospective cohort study
is one of the unique strengths of this study. Unlike previous
studies, this study has reported an adjusted estimate for a
range of time varying confounders including lifestyle and
sociodemographic factors. Despite this, the following limita-
tions have to be considered. All data, including weight and
GDM, were self-reported. If high risk (obese) or low risk
(under/normal weight) women differentially reported their
GDM status, associations could have been biased to either
direction. However, self-reported weight has shown to be a
reliable estimate [26] and a high level of agreement between
self-reported physician diagnosed GDM and the medical
record has been also found in a subpopulation of this cohort
[20]. Associations were adjusted for a variety of risk factors of
GDM, but unmeasured factors such as family history of GDM
or diabetes, ethnicity and gestational weight gain may have
introduced residual confounding.
The other limitation of this study is lack of statistical
power to fully assess the association between weight loss
and GDM particularly within BMI groupings. Young women
are gaining weight at a steady rate, a phenomenon not only
observed in Australia, and as fewer young women are losing
weight, it is getting more difficult to study the effects of
weight loss on risk of GDM [27]. Lastly, the high attrition rate
particularly from S1 to S2 may compromise the generalisabil-
ity of these findings, as non-respondents were considerably
different by baseline socio-demographic factors. Despite
these variations, earlier study in this population have shown
that effect estimates are not essentially biased due to loss to
follow up [28].
In conclusion, pre-pregnancy weight gain is an important
risk factor for the development of GDM and weight gain pre-
vention from early adulthood to prior to pregnancy may be
the main strategy to prevent the incidence of GDM. Clinicians
should be aware that even a small weight gain relatively over
a period of time in normal range of BMI is associated with
increased risk of GDM. Further prospective research particu-
larly on the effects of the timing and magnitude of pre-
pregnancy weight loss is clearly warranted.
