CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4-CTLs) have been reported to play a protective role in several viral infections. 
However, little is known in humans about the biology of CD4-CTL generation, their functional properties, and het-
erogeneity, especially in relation to other well-described CD4+ memory T cell subsets. We performed single-cell RNA 
sequencing in more than 9000 cells to unravel CD4-CTL heterogeneity, transcriptional profile, and clonality in humans. 
Single-cell differential gene expression analysis revealed a spectrum of known transcripts, including several linked to 
cytotoxic and costimulatory function that are expressed at higher levels in the TEMRA (effector memory T cells express-
ing CD45RA) subset, which is highly enriched for CD4-CTLs, compared with CD4+ T cells in the central memory (TCM) 
and effector memory (TEM) subsets. Simultaneous T cell antigen receptor (TCR) analysis in single cells and bulk subsets 
revealed that CD4-TEMRA cells show marked clonal expansion compared with TCM and TEM cells and that most of CD4-TEMRA 
were dengue virus (DENV)–specific in donors with previous DENV infection. The profile of CD4-TEMRA was highly 
heterogeneous across donors, with four distinct clusters identified by the single-cell analysis. We identified distinct 
clusters of CD4-CTL effector and precursor cells in the TEMRA subset; the precursor cells shared TCR clonotypes with 
CD4-CTL effectors and were distinguished by high expression of the interleukin-7 receptor. Our identification of a 
CD4-CTL precursor population may allow further investigation of how CD4-CTLs arise in humans and, thus, could 
provide insights into the mechanisms that may be used to generate durable and effective CD4-CTL immunity.
INTRODUCTION
After exposure to pathogens, naive CD4+ T helper (TH) lymphocytes 
differentiate into memory and effector TH cell subsets: tissue-resident 
memory cells, which are mainly retained in the tissues, and central 
memory (TCM) and effector memory (TEM) cells, which recirculate be-
tween the blood and lymphoid organs or tissues, respectively (1, 2). 
In addition, TH cell subsets have been classified on the basis of their 
cytokine profile and functional properties into TH1, TH2, TH17, TH* 
(TH1/TH17), regulatory T cell, and follicular helper (TFH) T cell sub-
sets (3, 4). Although T lymphocytes with cytotoxic function (CTLs) are 
predominantly restricted to conventional major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) class I–restricted CD8+ T lymphocytes, the existence 
of MHC class II–restricted TH cells with cytotoxic potential (CD4-CTLs) 
in humans, nonhuman primates, and mice has been reported for 
many decades (5, 6). However, compared with the other TH subsets, 
the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms that drive the differentia-
tion, maintenance, and function of human CD4-CTLs are poorly 
understood, mainly because of the lack of precise definition of the 
nature of this subset in humans.
CD4-CTLs were initially reported in humans with chronic viral 
infections such as human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), HIV, dengue virus 
(DENV), and hepatitis C virus (5, 7–15). CD4-CTLs have also been 
detected in mouse lungs as early as 1 week after acute influenza viral 
infection (16, 17). The magnitude of the CD4-CTL response has been 
associated with better clinical outcomes in both acute and chronic viral 
infections, implying that CD4-CTLs are an important component of the 
protective immune responses to viral infections (6). Furthermore, ex-
pansion of CD4-CTLs has been observed in donors carrying human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles associated with protection from 
severe dengue disease (7). Thus, eliciting a strong CD4-CTL response 
is considered an important goal of vaccination against certain viral 
infections (16, 18–20). The highly effective yellow fever vaccine has been 
shown to elicit a strong CD4-CTL response, which is required for 
protection against fatal infection in mouse models (18). CD4-CTLs 
have also been linked to protective antitumor immune responses, espe-
cially in virally induced tumors (18).
Given the importance of CD4-CTLs in acquired cellular immunity, 
we present here the single-cell transcriptomic and T cell antigen re-
ceptor (TCR) analysis of circulating human CD4-CTLs. CD4-CTLs were 
highly enriched in the effector memory T cells expressing CD45RA 
(CD4-TEMRA) subset and displayed notable intra- and interdonor 
heterogeneity. We show that the magnitude of CD4-TEMRA response 
is linked to the degree of clonal expansion and cytotoxicity profile of 
CD4-CTLs. Besides a comprehensive definition of the transcriptional 
program of conventional CD4-CTL effectors, we identified precursor 
cells sharing TCR clonotypes with CD4-CTL effectors that were dis-
tinguished by higher expression of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R).
RESULTS
Cytotoxicity-related genes are enriched in  
the CD4-TEMRA subset
Human CD4-CTLs are enriched in the CD4-TEMRA subset (defined as 
CD3+CD4+CD45RA+CCR7− cells) (Fig. 1A), most notably in donors

with previous DENV and CMV infection (5, 7–10). To capture the 
extent of cellular heterogeneity among human CD4-CTLs, we per-
formed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in more than 9000 
cells isolated ex vivo from the TEMRA subset and, as a control, in 
TH subsets that contain relatively fewer CD4-CTLs, such as TEM 
(CD3+CD4+CD45RA−CCR7− cells) and TCM (CD3+CD4+CD45RA−CCR7+ 
cells) subsets (Fig. 1A and table S1) (21). Using complementary methods 
of single-cell differential gene expression analysis [SCDE and MAST 
analysis, see Supplementary Materials and Methods and in (22, 23)], 
we compared the full-length transcriptome of CD4+ T lymphocytes 
present in TEMRA, TEM, and TCM subsets from three donors with pre-
vious DENV infection, carrying the HLA allele (DRB1*0401) previously

reported to be protective against severe dengue disease (Fig. 1B and 
table S1) (7, 24).
We found 111 “TEMRA-enriched” transcripts with significantly 
higher mean expression in single cells from the TEMRA subset compared 
with the TEM and TCM subsets (see Supplementary Materials and 
Methods, Fig. 1B, and table S2). These included several transcripts 
linked to the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural 
killer (NK) cells such as GZMB, PRF1, GZMH, GNLY, CCL4, CTSW, 
FCRL6, SPON2, CX3CR1, S1PR5, NKG7, and CD244 (Fig. 1, B and 
C) (6, 25); we confirmed the expression of some of these transcripts 
(CX3CR1, GPR56, CD244, CD314, KLRG1, GZMB, and PRF1) at the 
protein level (Fig. 1D). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (26) 
and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of TEMRA-enriched transcripts 
also revealed significant overrepresentation of cytotoxicity signature 
genes in the TEMRA subset (Fig. 1, E and F). Transcripts encoding tran-
scription factors (TFs) related to CTL function such as ZNF683 (Hobit), 
and Eomes and T-bet (encoded by TBX21) were also expressed at higher 
levels in single cells from the TEMRA subset (Fig. 1, B and C). ZNF683 
has recently been shown to identify human CD4-CTLs (24), and Eomes 
and T-bet appear to be important in the development of CD4-CTLs 
(27, 28). These results confirm that human CD4-CTLs are highly 
enriched in the TEMRA subset. Coexpression analysis of TEMRA- 
enriched 
transcripts also revealed a number of genes (PFN1, PFN1P1, EFHD2, 
VCL, DIP2A, SYNE1, and PLEK) (29–32) whose expression was 
highly correlated with cytotoxicity signature genes, suggesting that 
the products of these genes may also play important roles in the de-
velopment or function of CD4-CTLs (Fig. 1G).
CD4-CTLs show marked clonal expansion
Given that memory CD4-CTLs are mainly generated after exposure 
to certain viruses such as DENV or CMV (5, 7–10), we expected to 
see a more restricted TCR repertoire, that is, greater clonal expansion 
in the CD4-TEMRA subset compared with CD4+ T lymphocytes in the 
TEM or TCM subsets, which harbor a more common memory pool. 
We performed parallel analysis of the TCR repertoire in single cells 
by decoding the full-length transcriptome profiles generated by the 
Smart-seq2 assay (33, 34). Using the TraCeR software (35), we re-
constructed the TCR chains in 41 to 89% of single cells, the TCR 
chain in 31 to 81%, and both chains in 22 to 70% of cells across all 
memory subsets (table S3). As expected, a greater clonal expansion 
was observed in the TEMRA subset compared with other subsets, as 
shown by highly interconnected clonotype network graphs for single 
cells from donor #6 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the analysis of single 
cells that shared TCR or TCR chain clonotypes showed that more 
than 50% of cells in the TEMRA subset were clonally expanded (Fig. 2B, 
left and middle). To address the rare possibility of independent cells 
sharing one of the TCR chains, we also analyzed single cells that 
shared both TCR and TCR chain clonotypes and found that ~46% 
of cells in the TEMRA subset (CD4-CTL–enriched) were clonally ex-
panded compared with only ~5% and none of the cells in TEM and 
TCM subsets, respectively (Fig. 2B, right, and table S4). Together, these 
results suggested a highly restricted TCR repertoire in the TEMRA sub-
set (Fig. 2, A and B). The clonally expanded cells had a higher mean 
expression of cytotoxic signature genes (TEMRA-enriched gene set) 
(Fig. 2, C and D), suggestive of greater effector potential (6, 25, 36).
To probe the pathogen specificity of clonally expanded CD4-TEMRA 
cells (CD4-CTL–enriched), we first determined the TCR clonotype 
of single cells in the CD4-TEMRA subset that responded ex vivo to a 
pool of DENV-specific peptides (7, 37) from four donors with previ-
ous DENV infection (Fig. 2, E and F, fig. S1, and table S4). Next, we 
asked what fraction of these DENV-specific TCR clonotypes was 
present in the general pool of cells present in the TEMRA subset from 
the same donor. On an average, 64% (n = 4) of the clonally expanded 
cells in the general TEMRA population carried the DENV-specific TCR 
clonotypes, and in all donors, one or both of the top two clonally 
expanded clonotypes in the TEMRA population were always DENV- 
specific (Fig. 2, E and F, fig. S1, and table S4), which suggested that 
most of the clonally expanded cells in the TEMRA population in these 
individuals were specific for DENV.
CD4-CTLs (CD4-TEMRA cells) are heterogeneous  
across donors
We next asked whether the clonality and transcriptome of CD4-CTLs 
differed between donors with and without previous DENV infection 
or among donors across different geographical locations [Sri Lanka 
(Asia) and the Americas (Nicaragua and San Diego, California)]. We 
observed a wide range in the proportion (0 to 88%; median, 44%) of 
clonally expanded cells across the 12 donors with no major differences 
in their proportion when classifying donors based on previous DENV 
infection status or geographical location [Sri Lanka (Asia) versus the 
Americas; table S1]. When we compared the percentage of clonally 
expanded cells between donors with higher versus lower proportion 
of CD4+ T lymphocytes in the TEMRA subset (classified as TEMRA
high or 
TEMRA
low donors), we observed greater clonal expansion in TEMRA
high 
donors (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this finding, there was a positive 
correlation between the proportion of CD4+ T lymphocytes in the 
TEMRA subset and the percentage of clonally expanded cells, suggesting 
that donors with a larger TEMRA pool have a greater degree of clonal 
expansion (Fig. 3B).
In most donors, we observed sharing of a single unique TCR 
and TCR chain clonotype in a large fraction of CD4-TEMRA cells, as 
exampled in donor #4 [58% (11 of 19)], donor #1 [50% (21 of 42)], 
donor #2 [41% (24 of 58)], donor #5 [37% (11 of 30)], donor #8 
[22% (6 of 27)], donor #3 [16% (4 of 25)], and donor #6 [10% (7 of 
67)] of cells (Fig. 3C). Considering some of these donors were previ-
ously infected with DENV (DENV+ donors) raised the hypothesis 
that selection and expansion of such TCR clonotypes may be linked 
to the DENV infection. Even in donors without previous DENV in-
fection (DENV− donors), we observed very high levels of clonal ex-
pansion (Fig. 3C), suggesting that other infections—perhaps CMV, 
which is common in the general population—may also contribute to 
the preferential expansion of some CD4-CTL clones.
Besides the heterogeneity in clonality, we also observed marked vari-
ability in the expression of TEMRA-enriched transcripts in CD4-TEMRA 
cells across the study donors (Fig. 3, D and E). For several cytotoxicity- 
related transcripts, the expression pattern was highly variable across 
the 12 donors (Fig. 3, D and E). CD4-TEMRA cells from donors with a 
larger preexisting TEMRA pool and greater clonal expansion displayed 
more cytotoxic features (Fig. 3D). In other words, cytotoxicity-related 
transcripts were expressed in a greater fraction of single cells or at higher 
mean levels; other TEMRA-enriched transcripts such as ZNF683, PRSS23, 
FCRL6, and IFIT2 also showed a similar pattern (Fig. 3, D and E). We 
confirmed at the protein level that greater proportion of CD4-TEMRA 
cells expressed cytotoxicity-related molecules CD244, GPR56, GZMB, 
and PRF1 in donors with larger preexisting TEMRA pool (Fig. 3F). 
Therefore, our combined transcriptomic, protein, and TCR analysis 
suggests that the CD4-TEMRA subset exhibits quantitative and qualita-
tive differences across different donors irrespective of their DENV

infection status or geographical location and, in many instances, 
related to the CD4-CTL function.
CD4-CTL effector cells revealed by single-cell analysis
We next asked whether the heterogeneity observed in the single-cell 
transcriptomes of CD4-TEMRA was due to the presence of multiple 
distinct subsets. Four clusters were revealed by unbiased clustering 
of CD4-TEMRA cells from the 12 study donors (917 cells) using the 
Seurat software (Fig. 4A) (38); other methods of clustering also re-
vealed a similar pattern, and no major changes were introduced by 
technical and batch effects (see figs. S2 and S3, table S1, and Supple-
mentary Materials and Methods) (39). The proportion of cells in 
each cluster varied greatly among donors, with marked differences 
observed between donors from Sri Lanka and the Americas (Fig. 4B, 
left), suggesting that the nature and type of infections may shape the 
molecular profiles of CD4-CTLs. Clonal expansion was observed 
more frequently in cells from clusters 1 and 2 (Fig. 4B, right, and 
table S4).

Fig. 2. CD4-TEMRA cells show marked 
clonal expansion. (A) Clonotype network 
graphs of cells from the TEMRA, TEM, and 
TCM subset and DENV-specific TEMRA and 
DENV-specific TEM cells from donor #6. 
Each circle represents a single cell; the 
reconstructed TCR and TCR sequences 
for each cell are depicted as red- and 
blue-colored bars, respectively, inside 
each circle. Dark- and light-colored bars 
represent productive and nonproductive 
TCRs, respectively. Red connecting lines 
indicate shared TCR sequences; blue 
lines indicate shared TCR sequences. 
Red arrow indicates a precursor cell. Pur-
ple dashed line indicates a precursor 
cell and an effector cell sharing the same 
unique TCR and TCR chain clonotype. 
(B) Bar graph shows the percentage of 
cells with TCR (left), TCR (middle), and 
TCR (right) chain clonotype frequency 
≥2 (clonally expanded cells) in TEMRA, 
TEM, and TCM subsets. Error bars are 
mean ± SEM from three donors with the 
same HLA allele. *P < 0.05 from Student’s 
paired two-tailed t test. (C) Single- 
cell 
RNA-seq analysis shows the row-wise 
z score of normalized TPM counts for 
the indicated TEMRA-enriched transcripts 
(SCDE and MAST analysis comparing 
TEMRA cells with clonotype frequency 
≥2 or =1, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted 
P < 0.05 and ≥2-fold change) in clonally 
expanded cells (unique TCR and TCR 
chain clonotype frequency ≥2; magenta) 
and nonexpanded cells (unique TCR and 
TCR chain clonotype frequency =1; 
green). The cells are arranged on the 
basis of the clonotype frequency, and 
the numbers on the top in black boxes 
represent clonotype frequency. (D) Violin 
plots show the single-cell expression 
pattern of the indicated cytotoxicity- 
related transcripts in clonally expanded 
versus nonexpanded TEMRA cells. The 
shapes represent the distribution of cells 
based on their log2(TPM + 1) expression 
values (y axis). The color scale represents 
the mean expression. (E) Bar graph 
shows the number of TEMRA cells with a unique TCR and TCR chain clonotype for donor #6. Stars in red color indicate the clonotypes shared by DENV-specific TEMRA. Pie 
chart shows the percentage of expanded TEMRA cells that share the unique TCR and TCR chain clonotypes of DENV-specific TEMRA cells (pink). (F) Bar graph shows the 
percentage of the expanded TEMRA cells that share TCR clonotypes of DENV-specific TEMRA cells. Each dot represents a donor. Error bars are mean ± SEM from four 
donors.

Single-cell differential gene expression analysis among the four 
clusters revealed notable differences in their molecular profiles (Fig. 4C, 
fig. S4, A to D, and table S5). IPA and differential expression analysis 
of the transcripts enriched in clusters 1 and 2 compared with clusters 3 
and 4 showed significant overrepresentation of genes encoding products 
related to cytotoxicity, such as GZMB, GZMH, PRF1, GNLY, NKG7, 
ZNF683, and FGFBP2 (figs. S4, C and D, and S5 and table S5). Among 
these two clusters (1, 2), cluster 2 shows further enrichment for the 
cytotoxicity-related genes (figs. S4A and S5A), which suggested that 
cells in cluster 2 had a higher cytotoxic potential. Pairwise comparison 
of the clusters (fig. S4D and table S5) showed differences in the en-
richment of cytotoxicity-related genes among clusters 1 and 2; although 
several of them were expressed by both the clusters (GZMB, GZMH, 
GNLY, NKG7, FASLG, and CASP10), many were expressed in a 
cluster-specific manner (Fig. 4, D and E, fig. S4D, and table S5). On the 
basis of the differential expression pattern of cytotoxicity-related tran-
scripts in cluster 1 (FADD, IFNG, TNF, IFIT2, LMNA, CD69, FOS, 
JUN, DUSP1, and DUSP2) and cluster 2 (FGFBP2, SPON2, CX3CR1, 
GPR56, and PRF1), we hypothesize that their cytotoxic function is 
preferentially mediated by the FAS/death receptor and perforin path-
ways, respectively, which requires further functional verification (Fig. 4, 
D and E, fig. S4, A and D, and table S5).

Fig. 3. CD4-TEMRA cells are heteroge-
neous across donors. (A) Bar graph 
shows the percentage of clonally ex-
panded TEMRA cells (cells having a unique 
TCR and TCR chain clonotype with 
frequency ≥2) across 12 donors (left) 
and between donors classified on the 
basis of their status of previous DENV 
infection (DENV+ and DENV−), geograph-
ical location [Sri Lanka, Nicaragua, and 
San Diego (the Americas)], and CD4-TEMRA 
proportion (TEMRA
high, donors #1 to #6; 
TEMRA
low, donors #7 to #12). Each dot 
represents data from a single donor. 
Error bars are mean ± SEM. ***P = 0.001

ns, not significant. (B) Correlation be-
tween the proportions of the CD4-TEMRA 
subset in CD4+ T cells and clonally ex-
panded TEMRA cells (cells having a unique 
TCR and TCR chain clonotype with fre-
quency ≥2). r, Spearman correlation co-
efficient; P, by Student’s two-tailed paired 
t test. (C) Pie charts show the percentage 
of TEMRA cells with the first (clone 1) and 
second (clone 2) most frequent unique 
TCR and TCT chain clonotype, as well as 
other clonally expanded cells (all others) 
and the rest of the TCR and TCR chain 
clonotypes present in only one cell (unique

Cells in clusters 1 and 2 expressed higher levels of KLRG1 (40–42) 
and CX3CR1 (7, 43) transcripts, which are linked to effector status of 
memory cells, and lower levels of CD27 and CD28 transcripts, which 
encode costimulation molecules (Figs. 4E and 5, A and B) (44, 45). 
These results indicate that cells in clusters 1 and 2 have a terminal 
effector state and hence are CD4-CTL effectors with high cytotoxic 
potential. Genes linked to cell survival and CD4-CTL function such 
as PRSS23, SPON2, TCF7 (encodes for TCF1), CRTAM, and ZNF683 
(encodes for Hobit) (24, 46–51) were also highly expressed in single cells 
from clusters 1 and 2 (Fig. 4E). The role of ZNF683 (Hobit) (24, 46, 49) 
and other transcripts (PRSS23, SPON2, and TCF7) (47, 48) in the 
survival and long-term persistence of these high cytotoxic terminal 
effector cells deserves further investigation (45).
The TEMRA subset includes CD4-CTL precursor cells
We next examined the transcriptional profiles of cells in clusters 3 
and 4 to evaluate their clonal origin and functional relationship to the 
other cell populations. Compared with cells in clusters 1 and 2 (referred 
as CD4-CTL effectors), those in clusters 3 and 4 expressed lower levels 
of KLRG1 transcripts and higher levels of transcripts encoding IL-7R

diating the long-term homeostatic survival of naive and memory 
T lymphocytes (Fig. 5A) (52–55). The mean expression of IL7R 
transcripts in cluster 4 cells was even higher than that in TCM cells 
(Fig. 5, A and B). The opposing expression pattern of KLRG1 and 
IL7R transcripts in clusters 3 and 4 is similar to that observed in mem-
ory precursor effector cells (IL-7Rhigh and KLRG1−) described in murine 
models of resolving acute infections (52, 56). Transcripts encoding 
CD27 and CD28 costimulation molecules, lymphotoxin  (LTB), 
and JUNB TF were also expressed at higher levels in clusters 3 and 4, 
similar to the pattern observed in TCM cells (Fig. 5, B and C). However, 
cells in both clusters 3 and 4 were still markedly different from TCM

cells in that they expressed several transcripts that are specifically 
enriched in TEMRA cells (KLRG1, TBX21, S1PR5, FGFBP2, CCL4, 
PRF1, GZMH, GNLY, NKG7, ZEB2, and GPR56), albeit at lower levels 
compared with CD4-CTL effectors (cells in clusters 1 and 2) (Figs. 4E 
and 5C). On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that cells in 
clusters 3 and 4 likely represent memory precursor cells for the cells 
present in cluster 1 and 2 that have a terminal CD4-CTL effector 
phenotype.
Given that surface expression of IL-7R (CD127) can be readily 
determined by flow cytometry, we looked for the presence of potential 
CD4-CTL precursors within the CD4-TEMRA subset from an inde-
pendent cohort of healthy donors. For these studies, we capitalized 
on the La Jolla Institute cohort of 89 healthy donors, of which 15 
donors had longitudinal samples (two time points) (104 samples in 
total). As expected, there was a large variation (0.12 to 15.2%) in the 
proportion of the CD4-TEMRA subset across the study donors 
(Fig. 5D). On the basis of the surface expression pattern of IL-7R, 
cells in the CD4-TEMRA subset were classified into IL-7Rhigh and IL-7R− 
(Fig. 5E). The expression level of IL-7R on IL-7Rhigh TEMRA cells was 
similar to that observed in TCM and TN (naive T cell) CD4+ T lym-
phocytes (Fig. 5E and fig. S5B). These cells (IL-7Rhigh TEMRA cells) may 
represent the CD4-CTL precursors defined by our single-cell transcrip-
tome analysis. In longitudinal samples obtained at 3- to 6-month inter-
vals, the proportion of cells in the CD4-TEMRA subset was quite stable 
(Fig. 5F); however, in one donor, we noted a marked (>8-fold) expan-
sion of the CD4-TEMRA subset; this expansion was mainly confined to 
the IL-7R− TEMRA cells (CD4-CTL effectors), and not the IL-7Rhigh 
TEMRA (CD4-CTL precursors), perhaps reflecting an expansion of effec-
tors in response to an infection that occurred during the interval period 
(Fig. 5, F and G).
To further confirm that the IL-7Rhigh TEMRA subset (CD4-CTL 
precursors) shared the molecular profile of both TCM (long-term 
memory cells) and cytotoxic cells, we isolated IL-7Rhigh TEMRA and 
IL-7R− TEMRA (CD4-CTL effectors) along with TCM and TEM subsets 
and performed RNA-seq in two longitudinal samples from five do-
nors (Fig. 5H). Consistent with our single-cell cluster analysis (Fig. 5C), 
the IL-7Rhigh TEMRA subset shared molecular features of both TCM 
(memory precursor cells) and cytotoxic cells (IL-7R− TEMRA, CD4-CTL 
effectors) that were stable over two longitudinal visits (Fig. 5H and 
table S6). The IL-7Rhigh TEMRA subset (CD4-CTL precursors) expressed 
both cytotoxicity-related molecules (GPR56 and CD244) and a co-
stimulatory molecule (CD28, TCM-enriched) at the protein level (Fig. 5I). 
Together, these results show that cells in the IL-7Rhigh TEMRA subset 
have properties of memory precursor cells and cytotoxic cells.
CD4-CTL precursors share TCRs with CD4-CTL effectors
To verify our hypothesis, we analyzed the overlap in the TCR clono-
types of CD4-CTL effectors (clusters 1 and 2) with those from CD4-
CTL precursors (clusters 3 and 4). In a total of 5 of 12 donors, TCR 
clonotypes were shared between CD4-CTL precursors and effectors 
(Figs. 2A and 6A, fig. S6A, and table S4). As examples, in donor #1, 
23 of 80 TEMRA cells had the same TCR chain clonotype (fig. S6A) 
as a single cell from precursor cluster (cluster 3); in donor #12, four 
TCR chain clonotypes were shared between CD4-CTL precursors 
and effectors (Fig. 6A, clones highlighted in dashed lines with the 
precursor cells indicated with red arrows). A similar pattern was ob-
served in donors #3, #5, and #6 (Figs. 2A and 6A and table S4). To 
further support our inference, we constructed cell-state hierarchy 
maps using the Sincell software (39) for cells in the TCM, TEM, and 
TEMRA subsets and observed that CD4-CTL effectors clustered closest 
to the CD4-CTL precursors (Fig. 6B and fig. S6B). Together, these 
data lend support to the hypothesis that CD4-CTL effectors were 
mainly generated in vivo from distinct CD4-CTL precursor cells, 
although the possibility of arising from memory TEM or TCM cells 
cannot be excluded.
To support our hypothesis that CD4-CTL effectors are mainly 
derived from the precursor population, we performed a unique mo-
lecular identifier (UMI)–based TCR sequencing (TCR-seq) assays 
(57) in TCM, TEM, IL-7Rhigh TEMRA (CD4-CTL precursors), and IL-7R− 
TEMRA (CD4-CTL effectors) subsets from 14 donors (table S7). 
Consistent with single-cell TCR analysis (Fig. 2, A and B), the CD4-
CTL precursor and effector cells in the TEMRA subset had highly re-
stricted TCR repertoire, compared with cells in the TCM and TEM 
subsets, as shown by lower Shannon-Wiener diversity index (Fig. 6C) 
(58), and contained higher percentage of expanded clonotypes (Fig. 6, 
D, E and F, left, and fig. S7, left). A larger fraction of the clonotypes in 
the CD4-CTL precursor cells relative to TEM and TCM was composed 
of the expanded clonotypes (frequency, ≥3) present in the CD4-
CTL effector cells (Fig. 6E, middle, and fig. S7, middle). Further, the 
most expanded clonotype in the CD4-CTL effector cells was observed 
more often and at higher frequency in CD4-CTL precursor cells rel-
ative to TEM and TCM (Fig. 6E, right graphs, and fig. S7, right graphs).
We also performed TCR-seq in CD4+ T cell memory subsets from 
five donors who provided longitudinal samples obtained at 3- to 6-month 
intervals to assess the kinetics of precursor-effector relation. To better 
assess the relationship between effectors and putative precursors for 
each donor, we determined the proportion of expanded CD4-CTL ef-
fectors clono 
types from second visit (V2) that were present in the 
different CD4+ T cell memory subsets at the first visit (V1) (table S8). 
In four of the five donors analyzed, a greater fraction of the TCR 
clonotypes detected in CD4-CTL effectors at V2 was shared with cells 
in the precursor population (IL-7Rhigh TEMRA subset) relative to the 
TEM or TCM subset at V1 (Fig. 6F, middle, fig. S7, and table S8). A total 
of 12 of the CD4-CTL effector clonotypes from V2 were only found 
in CD4-CTL precursors at V1 but not in the TEM, TCM, or CD4-CTL 
effectors (table S8). Together, the kinetic data from the longitudinal 
samples provided stronger evidence to support the precursor-effector 
relationship and suggested that the IL-7Rhigh TEMRA subset is the pre-
dominant precursor/progenitor for the CD4-CTL effector cells.
Variable number of CD4-CTL precursors across donors
The proportion of CD4-CTL precursors varied greatly among do-
nors, ranging from 3 to 92% of cells in the TEMRA subset (fig. S8A). To 
determine whether additional CD4-CTL subsets exist and to defini-
tively assess the presence of CD4-CTL precursors, we analyzed single- 
cell transcriptomes of 10 times as many cells (>6000 cells) from two 
donors using the high-throughput 10× genomics platform. The sen-
sitivity of the 10× genomics platform, which uses beads to capture tran-
scripts and also sequences only their 3′ ends (59), is twofold lower than 
the Smart-seq2 protocol used to study full-length transcriptomes of the 
same donors (fig. S8, B and C). In donor #2, where 24 of 87 cells (28%) 
(fig. S8A) were previously assessed as CD4-CTL precursors, unbiased 
clustering of more than 3000 single-cell transcriptomes revealed two 
dominant clusters of ~2000 and ~1000 cells each, implying that sequenc-
ing more cells does not necessarily reveal additional clusters (Fig. 7A, 
left). These two clusters differentially expressed transcripts character-
istic of CD4-CTL effectors (GZMB and NKG7) and precursors (IL7R, 
JUNB, and LTB), respectively (Fig. 7B, left, and table S9). Even in

donor #1, where only 3 of 87 cells (3.4%) (fig. S8A) were previous-
ly found to be CD4-CTL precursors by full-length transcriptome 
analysis, we observed a similar proportion of CD4-CTL precursors 
[116 of 3664 cells (3.2%)] when analyzing more cells by the 10× ge-
nomics platform (Fig. 7, A and B, right, and table S9). At the single-cell 
level, CD4-CTL precursors in the CD4-TEMRA subset were distin-
guished by the high expression levels of IL7R transcripts. The ex-
pression pattern of molecules in CD4-CTL precursor and effector cells 
was further confirmed by single-cell RNA-seq analysis of purified 
population of IL-7Rhigh and IL-7R− TEMRA cells (Fig. 7C and table S1).

DISCUSSION
CD4-CTLs have long been considered to be terminal effector cells 
derived from TEM cells after persistent or repeated (long-term) anti-
gen stimulation in the context of certain viral infections, particularly 
CMV and DENV (7, 8, 14). Consistent with the notion, our single- 
cell transcriptome studies of the TEMRA subset did identify cells that 
have features of terminal CD4-CTL effector cells (KLRG1high and 
IL-7Rlow; clusters 1 and 2). However, we observed another popula-
tion of cells in the TEMRA subset that displayed a molecular program 
(KLRG1low and IL-7Rhigh; clusters 3 and 4) indicative of memory

precursor cells, intermixed with several features of CD4-CTLs 
(KLRG1, TBX21, S1PR5, FGFBP2, CCL4, PRF1, GZMH, GNLY, 
NKG7, ZEB2, and GPR56), albeit less prominently expressed than in 
the CD4-CTL effectors. Bulk and single-cell transcriptome analysis 
of the purified IL-7Rhigh and IL-7R− TEMRA subset further confirmed 
our observation from single-cell transcriptome analysis of total TEMRA 
subset. In several donors, we found cells in the CD4-CTL effector 
subset that shared their TCR clonotypes with cells in the precursor 
subset. TCR-seq analysis in longitudinal samples further confirmed 
this finding and provided more evidence for the relation between CD4- 
CTL precursors and effectors. Although the kinetic studies support 
the development of effectors from precursor cells, the nature of our 
studies in humans limits the definitive assessment of directionality; 
hence, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the progeni-
tor cell generated immediately after infection is the cytotoxic effector 
cell that eventually reverts. By defining the single-cell transcriptional 
program of CD4-CTL precursor cells, we have identified a number of 
previously unknown molecules potentially important for their dif-
ferentiation and function and represent attractive targets for further 
validation studies.
We showed that surface expression of the IL-7R (CD127) in TEMRA 
cells defines a subset of cells with the expression of IL-7R as high as that 
observed in the TCM subset. Given the established role of the IL-7R 
signaling pathway in homeostatic T cell proliferation and survival, 
such IL-7Rhigh TEMRA cells are likely to represent the precursors of 
CD4-TEMRA. The isolation of a CD4-CTL precursor subset based on 
the surface expression of IL-7R would enable detailed epigenetic studies 
to define the nature and extent of CD4-CTL reprogramming in such 
precursor cells. These future studies are likely to provide insights into 
the molecular mechanisms that govern the early development, differ-
entiation, and function of CD4-CTLs in humans as they transit from 
naive to memory precursor and effector cells.
The CD4-CTL effector cells displayed a number of known cyto-
toxicity molecules and previously unknown players (PFN1, PFN1P1, 
EFHD2, VCL, DIP2A, PLEK, and SYNE1) whose single-cell coexpression 
pattern suggests an important biological role for these molecules in 
CD4-CTL function. Further, their transcriptional program suggests 
that CD4-CTL effectors are terminally differentiated and likely 
short-lived because they express low levels of the costimulatory 
molecules CD27 and CD28 and high levels of KLRG1 transcripts 
(41, 52, 60–62). However, we observed marked clonal expansion of CD4-
CTL effectors in several donors, suggesting that, compared with other con-
ventional TH effector cells, different molecular mechanisms may operate 
in CD4-CTL effectors to promote their long-term survival. IL-7R− TEMRA 
CD4-CTL effectors highly expressed several molecules that are linked to 
cell survival such as CRTAM, ZNF683 (Hobit), PRSS23, SPON2, and 
TCF7 (encodes TCF1) (24, 46–51). Therefore, we hypothesize that these 
candidate molecules are likely to confer long-term survival properties to 
CD4-CTL effectors, which warrants further functional investigation in 
model organisms.
Overall, our single-cell transcriptomic studies in the human CD4- 
TEMRA population have uncovered an unprecedented level of hetero-
geneity, presumably created by the diverse nature of infections and 
the timing of exposures coupled with genetic diversity among our 
study donors. We identified a TEMRA subset of precursor CD4-CTLs, 
whose isolation and further characterization may open avenues for 
investigating the mechanisms that govern the generation of CD4- 
CTLs in humans. The stem-like virus-specific long-lived human mem-
ory T cell subset originating from TN cells has been described for 
CD8 compartment, where these cells share the molecular profiles of 
TN and TCM subsets (63). Considering the expansion of TEMRA in 
response to viral infections such as DENV and CMV, it is possible 
that IL-7Rhigh TEMRA subset (CD4-CTL precursors) may develop from 
such compartment. Understanding the origins and biology of poten-
tially long-lived CD4-CTL precursors may pave the way for developing 
strategies to boost durable CD4-CTL immune responses after vaccina-
tion against viral infections and cancer. A comprehensive assessment 
of heterogeneity in pathogen- or vaccine epitope–specific CD4-CTLs 
by single-cell approaches is likely to yield insights into the nature of 
protective CD4-CTL response generated against specific pathogens 
or vaccines.
