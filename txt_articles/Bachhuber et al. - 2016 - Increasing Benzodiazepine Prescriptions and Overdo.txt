Objectives.To describe trends in benzodiazepine prescriptions and overdose mortality
involving benzodiazepines among US adults.
Methods. We examined data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and multiple-
cause-of-death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Results. Between 1996 and 2013, the percentage of adults filling a benzodiazepine
prescription increased from 4.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.8%, 4.5%) to 5.6%
(95% CI = 5.2%, 6.1%), with an annual percent change of 2.5% (95% CI = 2.1%, 3.0%). The
quantity of benzodiazepines filled increased from 1.1 (95% CI = 0.9, 1.2) to 3.6 (95%
CI = 3.0, 4.2) kilogram lorazepam equivalents per 100 000 adults (annual percent
change = 9.0%; 95% CI = 7.6%, 10.3%).The overdose death rate increased from 0.58 (95%
CI = 0.55, 0.62) to 3.07 (95% CI = 2.99, 3.14) per 100 000 adults, with a plateau seen after
2010.
Conclusions. Benzodiazepine prescriptions and overdose mortality have increased
considerably. Fatal overdoses involving benzodiazepines have plateaued overall; how-
ever, noevidence of decreases was found in any group. Interventions to reduce theuse of
benzodiazepines or improve their safety are needed. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:686–

n 2013, an estimated 22 767 people died of
an overdose involving prescription drugs in
the United States.1 Benzodiazepines, a class of
medications with sedative, hypnotic, anxio-
lytic, and anticonvulsant properties, were
involved in approximately 31% of these fatal
overdoses.1 In 2008, an estimated 5.2% of
American adults filled 1 or more benzodi-
azepine prescriptions2; however, little is
known about national trends over time. We
investigated trends in prescriptions of ben-
zodiazepines and fatal overdoses involving
benzodiazepines among adults in the United
States.
METHODS
We obtained data on filled benzodiazepine
prescriptions from the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey. In each year of the survey, we
coded whether each adult respondent (age
‡ 18 years) filled 1 or more benzodiazepine
prescriptions. To calculate the total quantity
of benzodiazepine prescriptions filled each
year, we summed the quantity of each ben-
zodiazepine type and converted to milligram
lorazepam equivalents.3
Overdose deaths involving benzodiaze-
pines were extracted from multiple-cause-of-
death data from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention from 1999 to 2013.4
We defined overdose deaths involving ben-
zodiazepines as fatal drug or alcohol poi-
sonings (International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision,5 codes X40–X45, X60–X65,
Y10–Y15) when a benzodiazepine was also
coded (T42.4). This captures all overdose
deaths determined by the physician, medical
examiner, or coroner to involve a benzodi-
azepine, including those involving other
medications or illicit drugs.
To describe trends over time, we used the
Joinpoint Regression Program (Version
4.2.0.2; Statistical Research and Applications
Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville,
MD). We summarized trends between
joinpoints by calculating an annual percent
change. We summarized overall trends by
calculating the average annual percent change
over the entire study period. A full description
of the study methods is provided in the
Appendix (available as a supplement to the
online version of this brief at http://www.
ajph.org).
RESULTS
Between 1996 and 2013, the number of
adults filling a benzodiazepine prescription
increased 67%, from 8.1 million (confidence
interval [CI] = 7.3 million, 8.9 million) to
13.5 million (95% CI = 12.2 million, 14.7
million; Figure 1). Similarly, the percentage
of adults filling a benzodiazepine prescription
increased from 4.1% (95% CI = 3.8%, 4.5%)
to 5.6% (95% CI = 5.2%, 6.1%), with an
annual percent change of 2.5% (95%
CI = 2.1%, 3.0%). The total quantity of
benzodiazepines filled more than tripled from
1.1 (95% CI = 0.9, 1.2) to 3.6 (95% CI = 3.0,

95% CI= 7.6%, 10.3%; Table A, available
as a supplement to the online version of this
brief at http://www.ajph.org).
Among those filling benzodiazepine pre-
scriptions, the median cumulative quantity
filled over the year increased by 140%, from
86.8 (interquartile range = 29.8–282.0) to
208.0 (interquartile range = 56.0–652.9)
milligram lorazepam equivalents. In 2013, the
most common indications for benzodiazepine
prescription were anxiety disorders (56.1%
[95% CI = 52.2%, 60.1%]), mood disorders
(12.1% [95% CI = 9.0%, 15.2%]), and codes
in the unclassified category, which includes
codes for insomnia (12.0% [95% CI = 9.4%,
14.6%]). The rate of overdose deaths in-
volving benzodiazepines increased more than
4-fold from 0.58 (95% CI = 0.55, 0.62) to
3.07 (95% CI = 2.99, 3.14) per 100 000
adults; however, this rate appeared to plateau
after 2010.
Trends in prescriptions and overdose
mortality varied between demographic
groups (Appendix, Table A, and Figure A,
available as supplements to the online
version of this brief at http://www.ajph.
org). Despite an overall plateau in the rate
of overdose deaths involving benzodiaze-
pines, this rate continued to increase
throughout the study period for adults aged
65 or older and for Black and Hispanic
participants.
DISCUSSION
Between 1996 and 2013, overdose mor-
tality involving benzodiazepines rose at
a faster rate than did the percentage of in-
dividuals filling prescriptions and the quantity
filled. This could be the result of several
factors. First, increases in the total quantity
filled reflected both an increase in the number
of individuals filling benzodiazepine pre-
scriptions and substantial increases in the
amount each individual received. Among
people who filled benzodiazepine pre-
scriptions, the median quantity filled over the
year more than doubled between 1996 and
2013, suggesting either a higher daily dose or
more days of treatment, which potentially
increased the risk of fatal overdose.6 Second,
people at high risk for fatal overdose may be
obtaining diverted benzodiazepines (i.e., not
directly from medical providers). The pro-
portion of fatal overdoses involving diverted
versus prescribed benzodiazepines is un-
known. Finally, increases in alcohol use or
combining benzodiazepines with other
medications (e.g., opioid analgesics) could
increase the risk of fatal overdose and explain

 this rise. Prescribing of opioid analgesics
increased rapidly during most of the
period examined,7,8 concomitant benzodi-
azepine use among those prescribed
opioid analgesics is common,8,9 and
opioids are involved in an estimated
75% of the overdose deaths involving
benzodiazepines.10 The leveling off
of overdose mortality involving benzodi-
azepines was coincident with the time
when efforts to improve opioid safety
were becoming widespread and overdose
deaths involving opioid analgesics
stabilized.11
Future research should examine the
roles of these potential mechanisms to
identify effective policy interventions to
improve benzodiazepine safety. In
particular, as underscored by several
recent reports,6,10,12 interventions to
reduce concurrent use of opioid
analgesics or alcohol with benzodiazepines
are needed.
Limitations
This study had several limitations.
First, the Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey was limited to the civilian,
noninstitutionalized population, whereas
institutionalized patients, such as those
in correctional facilities or skilled
nursing facilities, are likely to have
different rates of benzodiazepine use
and overdose. Second, variation in
methods used to characterize deaths over
time and between states may have led to
misclassification. States vary in methods
used to characterize deaths, including
use of toxicological testing.13 Identifica-
tion of deaths involving benzodiazepines
may have improved over time with
widespread adoption of prescription
monitoring programs (i.e., state-level
registries of controlled substance pre-
scriptions). However, some drug
overdose deaths were missing
information on specific drugs involved
(approximately 22% in 2013).11
Therefore, our findings probably
represent underestimates. Third, we
could not analyze long-term versus short-
term use of benzodiazepines over time
because the duration of treatment of
prescriptions (i.e., the number of days’
supply) was not recorded for most years
of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
A recent study found that the prevalence
of long-term use (‡ 120 days) increased
with age; among people aged 65 to
80 years taking benzodiazepines, nearly
one third (31.4%) had long-term use.2
Fourth, precise estimates of benzodi-
azepine prescriptions filled among
subgroups were limited by sample sizes
in the Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey, which may have limited our
ability to detect changes in trends over
time. Finally, although the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey included
race/ethnicity information for Asian/
Pacific Islander and Native American/
Alaska Native populations, the sample
size was too small to produce reliable
estimates.
Public Health Implications
In summary, the number of American
adults filling a benzodiazepine prescription is
increasing, and the quantity filled is also
increasing. Although the rate of overdose
deaths involving benzodiazepines has stabi-
lized overall and in most groups, it remains
more than 5 times the rate at the start of the
study period. Continued increases in over-
dose deaths involving benzodiazepines
among certain groups (e.g., older adults and
racial/ethnic minority individuals) are
concerning. Furthermore, we found no
evidence of reductions in any group.
Interventions to reduce the use of benzo-
diazepines or improve their safety are
needed.
