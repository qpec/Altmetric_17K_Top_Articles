A novel EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), osimertinib, has marked efficacy in patients
with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. However, some patients show intrinsic resistance and an
insufficient response to osimertinib. This study showed that osimertinib stimulated AXL by
inhibiting a negative feedback loop. Activated AXL was associated with EGFR and HER3 in
maintaining cell survival and inducing the emergence of cells tolerant to osimertinib. AXL
inhibition reduced the viability of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cells overexpressing AXL that
were exposed to osimertinib. The addition of an AXL inhibitor during either the initial or
tolerant phases reduced tumor size and delayed tumor re-growth compared to osimertinib
alone. AXL was highly expressed in clinical specimens of EGFR-mutated lung cancers and its
high expression was associated with a low response rate to EGFR-TKI. These results indicated
pivotal roles for AXL and its inhibition in the intrinsic resistance to osimertinib and the
emergence of osimertinib-tolerant cells.

on-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating
mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) such as an exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation
responds to first- and second-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), including gefitinib, erlotinib, and afati-
nib1–4. However, 20–30% of NSCLC patients with mutated EGFR
are insensitive to EGFR-TKIs and are clinically nonresponders.
Several factors regarding the mechanisms of the intrinsic resis-
tance have been previously reported including the EGFR-T790M
mutation, EGFR-exon20 insertions, overexpression of hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), and BIM deletion polymorphism5–7. In
addition, about 30% of responders experience early relapse within
6 months due to acquired resistance8. The gatekeeper mutation
EGFR-T790M is the most common cause of acquired resistance
and is detectable in approximately 50% of patients who experi-
ence acquired resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-
TKIs9,10.
Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-TKI and inhibits
EGFR that have activating mutations and/or the T790M resis-
tance mutation, but not wild-type EGFR or other kinases, such
as AXL, AKT1, or HER3; thus, it is called the mutant-EGFR-
specific inhibitor11. It is approved for the treatment of EGFR-
T790M-positive NSCLC patients who acquired resistance to
first-generation or second-generation EGFR-TKIs. These tumors
are known to acquire resistance to osimertinib by mechanisms
that include acquisition of the EGFR-C797S mutation, loss
of the T790M mutation, activation of a bypass pathway, and
histological transformation including small cell transformation12.
Much attention has been paid to the efficacy of osimertinib in
the first-line setting of clinical intervention. A recent phase III
clinical trial (FLAURA) demonstrated that in patients with
EGFR-mutated NSCLC, progression-free survival (PFS) was
longer for those treated with first-line osimertinib than for those
treated with gefitinib or erlotinib13. Based on the results of the
FLAURA study, first-line treatment with osimertinib is con-
sidered as one of the standard treatments for NSCLC patients
with mutated EGFR. However, it was also noted that a population
of patients showed intrinsic resistance and an insufficient
response to osimertinib treatment, similar to that observed with
other EGFR-TKIs. Moreover, even in responders, the rate of
complete response is very low (3%) and residual lesions remain
in the majority of the patients. Such residual lesions may
serve as the basis of recurrent disease. Therefore, an under-
standing of the molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic
resistance and early refractoriness to osimertinib in EGFR-TKI
naïve EGFR-mutated NSCLC is needed in order to establish
novel therapies.
A recently identified small subpopulation of reversibly drug-
tolerant (DT) cells with >100-fold reduced drug sensitivity has
been reported to maintain viability via IGF-1 receptor signaling14
and is supposed to contain residual lesions in mutated EGFR of
NSCLC treated with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs.
However, the molecular mechanism by which NSCLC cells
emerge as DT cells to osimertinib is totally unknown.
AXL is the receptor for tyrosine kinase and was first identified
in 1991 in two patients with chronic myeloid leukemia15. High
expression of the AXL protein in tumors is reported to be asso-
ciated with poor prognosis in patients with several types of cancer
including glioblastoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and acute
myeloid leukemia16–19. Overexpression of AXL has been detected
more frequently in lung adenocarcinomas that harbor EGFR-
activating mutations, compared with NSCLC that have wild-type
EGFR20. Moreover, investigators from several studies have
reported that the activation of AXL signaling in tumors is asso-
ciated with acquired resistance to several targeted molecular
therapy drugs and chemotherapeutic agents. However, its roles in
intrinsic resistance and DT cells regarding specific targeted
molecular therapy drugs remain unknown21–24.
The current study was designed to clarify the molecular
mechanisms underlying the induction of tolerance to osimertinib
in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells, including the roles of AXL sig-
naling during the initial and tolerant phases. We determined that
AXL interacted with other molecules, including EGFR and HER3,
and maintained survival of tumor cells exposed to osimertinib.
AXL inhibition using specific siRNA or chemical compounds in
tumor cell-derived xenograft (CDX) models and patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models reduced the viability of osimertinib-
exposed tumor cells, inhibited the emergence of DT cells, and
delayed the recurrence of tumors.
Results
Osimertinib activated AXL and re-activated HER3 and EGFR.
EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells, including PC-9 cells, were highly
sensitive to the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib. As the
Cmax in patient plasma following oral administration of 80 mg of
osimertinib was 635.4 nM25, we considered that 1 μM or less
would be a clinically relevant concentration of osimertinib.
However, approximately 20–30% of the PC-9 cells survived, even
after treatment with a high concentration (1 µM) of osimertinib
for 72 h (Supplementary Figure 1). To determine the mechanism
by which these cells escaped the effects of osimertinib, we eval-
uated 43 phospho-kinases in PC-9 cells treated with or without
osimertinib for 72 h using a phospho-kinase antibody array. We
found that the phosphorylation of some molecules, such as HER3,
MET, and AXL, increased after osimertinib treatment (Fig. 1a).
We therefore hypothesized that tolerance to osimertinib may be
caused by a survival signal via these proteins. Kinetic analysis
revealed that while phosphorylation of EGFR was remarkably
inhibited by osimertinib at 4 h, it was measurably re-activated at
72 h (Fig. 1b). The phosphorylation of HER3 and MET was also
inhibited by osimertinib at 4 h, but the phosphorylation of these
proteins was re-activated at 24 h and the reactivation gradually
increased through 72 h. On the other hand, while AXL was not
constitutively phosphorylated, its phosphorylation was induced
by osimertinib at 4 h and increased through 72 h. Phosphoryla-
tion of ERK, a downstream molecule of EGFR, was remarkably
inhibited by osimertinib at 4 h and the suppression was main-
tained through 72 h. In sharp contrast, AKT, another downstream
molecule of EGFR signaling, was slightly inhibited by osimertinib
at 4 h and was re-activated at 24 h. These results suggested that
osimertinib exposure may have activated AXL and thereby re-
activated HER3, MET, and EGFR in PC-9 cells.
We next examined the effect of knockdown of HER3, MET,
and AXL on the viability of PC-9 and PC-9GXR cells, which have
exon 19 deleted and the T790M mutation in EGFR. In the
absence of osimertinib, knockdown of HER3, MET, and AXL
using specific siRNAs resulted in the inhibition of PC-9 and PC-
9GXR cell viability by 30–40%, 25%, and less than 20%,
respectively (Fig. 1c). Osimertinib inhibited the viability of both
PC-9 and T790M-positive PC-9GXR cells by 50%, consistent
with its activity as third-generation EGFR-TKI. In the presence
of osimertinib for 72 h, knockdown of MET did not affect
cell viability, while knockdown of HER3 or AXL further decreased
the viability of PC-9 and PC-9GXR cells to about 20%. These
results suggested that AXL and HER3 may have promoted the
survival of a subset of EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells in which
the EGFR signal was inhibited by the 72-h exposure to
osimertinib. In comparison to osimertinib treatment, when PC-
9 and PC-9GXR cells were treated with siRNA specific for EGFR,
cell viability was reduced by 25–30%. Knockdown of HER3
also reduced cell viability by 25–30%, but knockdown of AXL

 only marginally reduced cell viability. These results are consistent
with previous findings that heterodimerization of EGFR and
HER3 contributes to the maintenance of oncogenic signaling in
EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells26. Under these experimental condi-
tions, dual knockdown of EGFR and either AXL or HER3 showed
greater reductions in cell viability compared with the knockdown
of EGFR alone (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, dual knockdown of HER3
and AXL decreased cell viability as effectively as the dual
knockdown of EGFR and AXL, suggesting an interaction between
AXL and EGFR or HER3.
We next examined the phosphorylation status of these
molecules in PC-9 cells, with or without the knockdown of
AXL or HER3. Treatment of PC-9 cells with specific siRNAs
efficiently knocked down the protein expression of either AXL or
HER3 (Fig. 1e). In PC-9 cells treated with control siRNA, 72 h
exposure to osimertinib resulted in only slight suppression of
EGFR phosphorylation, consistent with the results shown in
Fig. 1b, presumably due to reactivation. Interestingly, in PC-9
cells treated with siRNA for AXL, the same 72 h osimertinib
treatment greatly inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and HER3.

 This phenomenon was not observed in PC-9 cells treated with
siRNA
for
HER3.
Immunoblots
after
immunoprecipitation
revealed that 72 h treatment with osimertinib enhanced the
binding of AXL to HER3 and to EGFR, but not the binding of to
HER3 to EGFR (Fig. 1f). These results indicated that AXL was
activated by osimertinib exposure and maintained cell survival in
some of the PC-9 and PC-9GXR cells, presumably by interacting
with EGFR and HER3.
To assess the mechanism by which AXL phosphorylation was
adversely activated by osimertinib, we investigated the involve-
ment of the negative feedback loop from ERK to the sprouty
(SPRY) family proteins, which inhibits phosphorylation of
various receptor tyrosine kinases27,28. Osimertinib treatment
decreased the levels of SPRY4 in PC-9 cells (Supplementary
Figure 2A). Knockdown of SPRY4 using specific siRNA increased
the expression of phosphorylated AXL (Supplementary Fig-
ure 2B). In contrast, overexpression of SPRY4 maintained
expression levels of phosphorylated AXL in PC-9 cells exposed
to
osimertinib
(Supplementary
Figure
2C).
These
results
indicated that osimertinib adversely activated AXL, at least in
part, by shutting off the negative feedback loop to SPRY4, which
suppressed AXL phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 2D).
AXL inversely correlated with susceptibility to EGFR-TKIs. We
next sought to evaluate the correlation between AXL expression
and susceptibility to EGFR-TKIs, including osimertinib, in EGFR-
mutated NSCLC cell lines. The nine tested EGFR-mutated
NSCLC cell lines were categorized into those with high levels of
AXL expression (AXL-βactin ratio of >7.0) and those with low
levels of AXL expression (AXL-βactin ratio of ≦7.0). EGFR
phosphorylation and SPRY4 levels tended to be higher in the cells
with the relatively lower AXL expression levels (Spearman rank
correlation = −0.6 and P = 0.048; Spearman rank correlation =
−0.644 and P = 0.061, relatively); whereas, there were no clear
differences in the expression of epithelial−mesenchymal transi-
tion (EMT)-related proteins, total EGFR, or phosphorylated
HER3 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figures 3A, 3B, 3C, and 4).
Importantly, the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s)
of both osimertinib and gefitinib were significantly higher in cells
demonstrating the higher relative AXL expression levels than in
the lower expressing cells (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the AXL expres-
sion levels had a most strong positive correlation with osimertinib
susceptibility among several related proteins (Spearman rank
correlation = 0.733; P = 0.031) (Supplementary Figure 5, 6, sup-
plementary Table 1).
We also retrospectively assessed the correlations between AXL
expression and the clinical efficacy of the first- and second-
generation EGFR-TKIs and osimertinib in 46 patients with
EGFR-mutated NSCLC and in 11 patients with EGFR-mutated
NSCLC harboring the T790M mutations, respectively. Expression
of AXL in the cell cytoplasm of pre-EGFR-TKI-treated tumor
samples was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC)
staining and scored as high (3+), intermediate (2+), low (1+),
and no (0) expression of AXL (Supplementary Figure 7A). Of the
46 EGFR-mutated NSCLC tumor specimens for the first- and
second-generation EGFR-TKIs, high, intermediate, low, and
no AXL expression was observed in 12 (26.1%), eight (17.4%),
23 (50.0%), and three (6.5%) specimens, respectively. Of the 11
EGFR-mutated NSCLC tumors for osimertinib, high, intermedi-
ate, low, and no AXL expression was observed in three (27.2%),
one
(18.2%),
seven
(63.6%),
and
zero
(0.0%)
specimens,
respectively. The response rate for the first- and second-
generation EGFR-TKIs for the patients with AXL expression
scores of 0 to 2+ was high (87.5−100%), whereas for those
patients with AXL expression scores of 3+, the response rate for
the first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs was significantly
lower (50%) (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2c). The response rate for
osimertinib for the patients with AXL expression scores of 0 to
2+ was high (85.7−100%), while for those patients with AXL
expression scores of 3+, the response rate for osimertinib was
relatively lower (66.7%) (Fig. 2d). Moreover, the PFS following
treatment with the first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs
and osimertinib trended toward being shorter in the patients
with AXL expression scores of 3+, compared with those with
AXL expression scores of 0 to 2+ (P = 0.168 and hazard
ratio
(HR) = 0.58;
P = 0.449
and
HR = 0.81,
respectively)
(Supplementary Figure 7B, 7C).
These findings suggested that AXL expression correlated with a
poor initial response to EGFR-TKI treatment, including osimer-
tinib, and correlated to early relapse.
AXL knockdown sensitized AXL-expressing cells to osimerti-
nib. We examined whether the knockdown of AXL protein
expression increased the sensitivity of EGFR-mutated NSCLC
cells to EGFR-TKIs, including osimertinib. Treatment with AXL-
specific siRNA enhanced the inhibitory effects of osimertinib on
the viability of cell lines PC-9, PC-9GXR, and HCC4011, all of
which express high levels of AXL, but had only a marginal effect
on the viability of cell lines HCC827, HCC4006, and H3255,
which express low levels of AXL (Fig. 3a). Similar results were
observed with treatment with gefitinib except in PC-9GXR cells,
which have the EGFR-T790M mutation. The IC50 values for
osimertinib and gefitinib in the high-AXL-expressing cell lines
treated with anti-AXL siRNA were significantly lower than those
treated with control siRNA (P = 0.0014 for osimertinib and P =
0.0028 for gefitinib) (Fig. 3b). Treatment with AXL-specific
siRNA did not significantly affect IC50 values for osimertinib or
gefitinib in low-AXL-expressing cells. Western blot analysis
showed that treatment of PC-9, PC-9GXR, and HCC4011 cells
with osimertinib plus AXL-specific siRNA inhibited the phos-
phorylation of AKT more than did treatment with osimertinib
plus control siRNA (Fig. 3c). In contrast, osimertinib plus AXL-
specific siRNA treatment of the cell lines did not affect the
phosphorylation of ERK compared with osimertinib plus control
siRNA treatment. These findings suggested that AXL knockdown
resulting in the suppression of the AKT axis may have sensitized
high-AXL-expressing EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells to EGFR-TKIs
and reduced cell survival after 3 days of treatment.
AXL inhibitor sensitized AXL-expressing cells to osimertinib.
We evaluated whether AXL inhibitors could increase the sensi-
tivity of EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells to EGFR-TKIs. NPS1034, an
AXL inhibitor, did not affect the viability of the EGFR-mutated
NSCLC cell lines that were tested. The use of NSP1034 in com-
bination with the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib or
rociletinib for 72 h increased cell sensitivity to these EGFR-TKIs
and reduced the viability of high-AXL-expressing PC-9, PC-
9GXR, and HCC4011 cells, but not that of the low-AXL-
expressing HCC827 cells (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figure 8).
We proved that AXL was the target of NPS1034 for the sensiti-
zation of EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells to osimertinib using wild-
type AXL overexpression system in PC-9 cells (Supplementary
Figure 9A, 9B).
Consistent with the results of treating cells with AXL-specific
siRNA combined with the use of osimertinib and NPS1034 for 1 h
or 72 h more remarkably inhibited the phosphorylation of AXL,
EGFR, HER3, and AKT compared with treatment of the high-
AXL-expressing cell lines with osimertinib alone (Fig. 4b, c). In
contrast, in the low-AXL-expressing cell lines, osimertinib and
NPS1034 did not affect the phosphorylation of AKT, compared to

 osimertinib alone (Supplementary Figure 10). Combined use of
another AXL inhibitor (ASP2215) with osimertinib for 72 h also
produced similar effects in PC-9 and HCC4011 cells (Supple-
mentary Figure 11) compared with the treatment of the cells with
osimertinib alone.
To further elucidate the profiles of the downstream molecules
of the AXL axis, we investigated the combined efficacy of
osimertinib with molecular-targeting
drugs,
such
as
those
targeting AKT, MEK, or NFκB, in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells
with a high level of AXL. Of them, the AKT inhibitor buparlisib
showed additional effects when administered with osimertinib,
compared to trametinib (an MEK inhibitor) or caffeic acid
phenethyl ester (CAPE, an NFκB inhibitor) (Supplementary
Figure 12). The expression of stem cell- and EMT-related proteins
was not remarkably affected by osimertinib with or without
NPS1034 (Supplementary Figure 13).
These results clearly indicated that the cell sensitivity to
osimertinib could be increased by the combined treatment with

H1650, H1975, HCC4011, HCC827, H3255, and HCC4006 were lysed and the indicated proteins were detected by western blotting. b The IC50 values for
the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and osimertinib in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells. The IC50 values for both gefitinib and osimertinib were significantly higher in cells
expressing high levels of AXL compared to cells expressing low levels of AXL. P values were calculated using the Mann Whitney U test. c Correlation
between the cytoplasmic AXL protein expression levels determined immunohistochemically and the response to treatment with EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-
mutated NSCLC specimens from 46 patients. d Correlation between the expression levels of the cytoplasmic AXL protein, determined
immunohistochemically, and response to treatment with osimertinib in EGFR-mutated NSCLC specimens from 11 patients

 an AXL inhibitor, by predominantly modulating the AKT
activity, resulting in reduced viability of high-AXL-expressing
EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines.
AXL inhibitor prevented the emergence of drug-tolerant cells.
Drug-tolerant (DT) cells are defined as a small subpopulation of
cells with remarkably reduced sensitivity to targeted drugs. They
are generated within several days to several weeks of exposure to
target drugs. DT cells are believed to be the basis for tumor
recurrence due to the cells acquiring resistance. Thus, we exam-
ined whether AXL was involved in the emergence of DT cells
exposed to osimertinib. We isolated DT cells after 9 days of
exposure of PC-9 and HCC4011 cells to osimertinib (1–3 µM). A
large population of PC-9 DT cells were in the G1 phase of the cell
cycle, as previously reported14 (Supplementary Figure 14).
Although the percentage of mutated EGFR-allele and the copy
number of the EGFR gene were not affected in the DT cells
(Supplementary Table 2), the DT cells were highly insensitive to
osimertinib compared with their parental cells (Fig. 5a). A pre-
vious study demonstrated that DT cells derived from PC-9 cells
exposed to erlotinib maintained their viability via IGF-1R sig-
naling14. Consistent with this previous report, we found that the
DT cells resistant to osimertinib had higher expression and
phosphorylation levels of the IGF-1R protein compared with
parental PC-9 cells (Fig. 5b). Moreover, the DT cells expressed
higher levels of EGFR, HER3, and AXL compared with that in the
parental cells (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, while AXL phosphorylation
increased, the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER3 decreased in
DT cells compared with that in parental cells, suggesting a
dependency on AXL and IGF-1R for the viability of DT cells. In
fact, more AXL protein was associated with EGFR and HER3 in
the DT cells compared to that in the parental cells (Fig. 5c). Both

 the AXL inhibitor (NPS1034) and IGF-1R inhibitor (OSI906)
discernibly decreased the viability of DT cells, but not that of the
parental PC-9 or HCC4011 cells (Fig. 5d). The combined treat-
ment of DT cells with NPS1034 and OSI906 further inhibited
their viability. Western blotting analysis showed that while osi-
mertinib did not inhibit the phosphorylation of EGFR, HER3,
ERK, or AXL in the DT cells, NSP1034 treatment alone inhibited
the phosphorylation of AXL, EGFR, and HER3, and thus sup-
pressed the phosphorylation of AKT but did not affect the
phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 5e). Moreover, the continuous
cotreatment of PC-9, PC-9GXR, and HCC4011 cells with osi-
mertinib and NPS1034 prevented the emergence of DT cells
(Fig. 5f). These results indicated that in addition to IGF-1R, AXL
played a pivotal role in the emergence of DT cells to osimertinib.
Intriguingly, the AXL-mediated resistance was irreversible at least
for 9 days with drug-free condition and was not easily reversible
(Supplementary Figure 15).
AXL inhibition with osimertinib shrunk in vivo tumors. To
determine whether AXL affected the sensitivity of high-AXL-
expressing EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells to osimertinib in vivo, we
used PC-9 cells in which AXL expression was continuously
knocked down by transfection of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs).
Transfection of shRNA specific for AXL (#37 and #38) resulted in
the inhibition of AXL protein expression with AXL shRNA #38
being more efficient than was AXL shRNA #37 at AXL knock-
down (Fig. 6a). While the growth of PC-9 cells transfected with
the shRNA was slightly slower than that of PC-9 cells transfected
with a control shRNA (PC-9shSCR), both the knockdown
transfectants grew at a constant rate in vitro (Fig. 6b). Therefore,
we chose the AXL shRNA #38-transfected PC-9 cells (PC-
9shAXL#38) for use in the subsequent experiments.
PC-
9shAXL#38 cells were more sensitive to osimertinib and gefitinib
than control PC-9shSCR cells (Fig. 6c). In a subcutaneous tumor
model, the growth rates of tumors derived from PC-9shAXL#38
cells were slower than those derived from PC-9shSCR cells
(Fig. 6d). In the model using PC-9shSCR cells, continuous osi-
mertinib treatment initially resulted in slight tumor regression
but the tumors re-grew within 10 days, indicating a rapid
recurrence. In sharp contrast, the same treatment in the model
using PC-9shAXL#38 cells resulted in dramatic tumor shrinkage
with the tumors never re-growing in 24 days, the duration of the
experiments. In the tumors derived from PC-9shAXL#38 cells,
expression of the AXL protein was successfully knocked down
(Fig. 6e). The number of Ki-67-positive proliferating tumor cells
was significantly lower in the osimertinib-treated tumors derived
from PC-9shAXL#38 cells than in those derived from PC-9shSCR
cells (Fig. 6f, g). The C797S EGFR-mutation did not appear in
each group of mice at the end of the experiment (Supplementary
Table 3). None of the groups of mice showed a significant weight
loss through the 24 days of treatment (Supplementary Fig-
ure 16A). These data clearly indicated that AXL retained the
viability of osimertinib-treated PC-9 cells in vivo and that AXL
knockdown improved the response of the tumors to osimertinib
treatment and prevented recurrence.
AXL inhibitor with osimertinib prevented CDX tumor re-
growth. We next evaluated the effect of NSP1034 treatment

 combined with osimertinib treatment in a cell-line-derived
xenograft (CDX) model using high-AXL-expressing PC-9 cells.
Using this approach, we evaluated the effect of NSP1034 using
two different treatment schedules, (1) during the initial phase and
(2) during the tolerant phase. For the initial phase studies, mice
were continuously administered osimertinib alone, NSP1034
alone, or a combination of osimertinib and NSP1034 for 5 days a
week by oral gavage until the end of experiment (Fig. 7a).
Treatment with NSP1034 alone had no effect on the growth of
PC-9 tumors. Treatment with osimertinib alone caused tumor
regression within 1 week, but the tumors re-grew within 7 weeks,
indicating rapid recurrence due to acquired resistance. Combined
treatment with osimertinib and NSP1034 also caused tumor
regression within 1 week and the size of the regressed tumors was
maintained for 10 weeks. These results indicated that combined
treatment with osimertinib and NSP1034 commenced during the
initial phase prevented the rapid growth of high-AXL-expressing
EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells in vivo. No apparent adverse events,
including weight loss, were observed during these treatments
(Supplementary Figure 16B). For the tolerant phase studies, all
the PC-9 tumor-bearing mice were initially treated with osi-
mertinib alone and the tumor size regressed within 1 week
(Fig. 7b). On day 8, the mice were randomly divided into two
groups. One group was treated with osimertinib alone and the
other was treated with both osimertinib and NSP1034. The
tumors treated with osimertinib alone re-grew, again showing
rapid recurrence. The re-growth of the tumors treated with osi-
mertinib and NSP1034 was much slower than those treated with
osimertinib alone. Overall, the results from the rapid recurrence
model using PC-9 cells indicated that the combined treatment of

 osimertinib with NSP1034 commenced during either the initial
phase or tolerant phase prevented tumor re-growth following
osimertinib treatment.
AXL inhibitor combined with osimertinib stabilized PDX
tumor. Finally, using two different treatment schedules we eval-
uated the effect of NSP1034 against patient-derived xenograft
tumors that highly expressed the AXL protein (Fig. 7c). In
treatment during the initial phase, NSP1034 alone had no effect
on the growth of PDX tumors (Fig. 7d). Treatment during the
initial phase with osimertinib alone slightly delayed tumor growth
compared to tumors in control animals, but the tumors never
regressed, indicating that the PDX tumors were intrinsically
resistant to osimertinib. Under these experimental conditions,
combined treatment with osimertinib and NSP1034 resulted in
the stabilization of tumor growth. No apparent adverse events,

Discussion
The efficacy of TKI treatment of tumors with driver oncogenes is
limited due to the reactivation of specific signaling pathways via
multiple feedback mechanisms, demonstrating the need to
develop
therapeutic
approaches
to
effectively
treat
these
cancers28,29. The current study was performed to investigate the
major feedback mechanisms that emerged as a result of exposure
of NSCLC to osimertinib, identifying the occurrence of an
adaptive response due to the activation of AXL, which binds to
the HER family proteins EGFR and HER3 through a negative
feedback loop involving the suppression of SPRY4. We previously
demonstrated the role of SPRY4 in mesenchymal-like KRAS-
mutant lung cancers in which FGFR1 is dominantly expressed
but suppressed by the negative regulatory sprouty proteins,
including SPRY4 28. This is the first report that SPRY4 might be a
potential negative regulator of AXL signaling in lung cancer with
driver oncogenes that is treated with osimertinib.
AXL has been reported to promote EGFR-induced signaling by
binding to EGFR and other members of the HER family including
MET and PDGFR, resulting in acquired resistance to EGFR-
TKIs30. In addition, the activation of AXL signaling has been
shown to have varying cell-specific and tissue-specific effects
during treatment with EGFR-targeted agents. For instance, in
wild-type EGFR cancer cells, AXL overexpression induces resis-
tance to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab via MAPK signal-
ing31.
In
contrast,
the
primary
escape
mechanism
from
osimertinib treatment in the EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells was
through a downregulation of SPRY4, which predominantly acti-
vates the AXL-AKT axis. The precise mechanism remains unclear
because the specific scaffold protein related to AXL activation was
not detected. We plan to conduct further experiments to identify
these proteins and further define the mechanism.
EMT with high-AXL expression is reported to be associated
with acquired resistance to various drugs, including EGFR-
TKIs21. It is unclear, however, whether AXL is an inducer or
effector of the EMT process and whether AXL inhibition, com-
bined with an EGFR-TKI, is able to overcome the acquired
resistance to EGFR-TKIs induced by EMT, a feature that may be
closely associated with tumor heterogeneity21,32,33. AXL inhibi-
tion is shown to be pivotal in overcoming intrinsic or acquired
resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors by melanoma harboring
NRAS and BRAF mutations34. Therefore, the present study
focused on the role of AXL during the initial treatment of EGFR-
mutated NSCLC cells in an effort to prevent the development of
resistant clones via AXL signaling, which may be involved in the
promotion of EMT. Cell-based assays showed that osimertinib
treatment in combination with AXL inhibitors initiated during
the initial phase had greater inhibitory effects on EGFR-mutated
NSCLC cells. Moreover, in vivo experiments demonstrated that
this combination prevented the re-growth of CDX tumors in a
rapid recurrence model for osimertinib and stabilized PDX
tumors in an intrinsic resistance model for osimertinib. To our
knowledge, this report is the first to demonstrate the efficacy and
tolerability of osimertinib combined with an AXL inhibitor in the
treatment of EGFR-mutated NSCLC. The results also suggested
that this approach might prevent escape by acquired resistance to
osimertinib by these cancers.
Despite showing a good initial response to targeted molecular
therapy, a small percentage of cells survived and expanded,
resulting in acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. These drug-
tolerant cells result in tumor heterogeneity, enhancing tumor
recurrence35–37. A recent study showed that GPX4 inhibition
induced ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, in
various types of persistent cancer cells, which acquire a depen-
dency on GPX4 and resistance to specific targeted molecular
therapy38. While a small subpopulation of DT cells is reported to
maintain viability via IGF-1R signaling in EGFR-mutated NSCLC
treated with first EGFR-TKIs14, the current study also demon-
strated AXL binding to EGFR and IGF-1R in DT cells treated
with osimertinib, and thus AXL activation was greater in DT cells
than in the parental cells. Treatment with an AXL or IGF-1R
inhibitor alone reduced the viability of cells that were tolerant to
osimertinib, suggesting that the DT cells may switch to the AXL-
IGF-1R axis, independent of the AXL-HER family axis. Impor-
tantly, we demonstrated here that the exposure of EGFR-mutated
NSCLC cells to osimertinib caused a dynamic change of specific
related proteins via their signal transduction in order for the cells
to survive and escape from cell death. Unfortunately, we were
unable to identify the specific EGFR proteins that bound to AXL
and that were crucial for drug tolerance. These observations
clearly demonstrated that AXL signaling played crucial roles in
EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells regarding both the initial adaptive
response to osimertinib and in the development of tolerance.
Aside from the EGFR-T790M-resistant mutations, promising
biomarkers for acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKIs
have not been identified. Therefore, it may not be worthwhile to
evaluate all patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs to
determine which have the potential for AXL inhibition. We found
that AXL overexpression was associated with a poor response to
osimertinib, as well as to the first- and second-generation EGFR-
TKIs in the clinical setting, suggesting that overexpression of AXL
may be a novel biomarker for the initial tolerance of EGFR-
mutated NSCLCs to EGFR-TKIs. The limitation of our study is
the small number of clinical specimens used in Fig. 2d. Larger
scale studies are, therefore, warranted to further clarify the cor-
relation between AXL expression and the clinical response to
osimertinib in EGFR-TKI naïve EGFR-mutated NSCLCs in the
future.
In conclusion, this study showed that high levels of AXL
activation had biological significance in EGFR-driven NSCLC
cells treated with the EGFR-TKI osimertinib. Our findings
demonstrated a pivotal role for AXL in the intrinsic resistance of
EGFR-mutated lung cancer to osimertinib and the emergence of
osimertinib-tolerant cells. These results suggest that treatment
during the initial phase with a combination of osimertinib and an
AXL inhibitor may prevent the development of intrinsic resis-
tance to osimertinib and the emergence of drug-tolerant cells in
EGFR-mutated lung cancer overexpressing AXL.
Methods
Cell cultures and reagents. Nine human NSCLC cell lines with mutations in
EGFR were utilized. The human NSCLC cell lines HCC4011 and H3255 were
generously provided by Drs. David P. Carbone (Ohio State University Compre-
hensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH) and John D. Minna (University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), respectively. The H1975 human lung
adenocarcinoma cell line with the EGFR-L858R/T790M double mutation was
kindly provided by Drs. Yoshitaka Sekido (Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute,
Japan) and John D. Minna. The human cell lines HCC827, HCC4006, and H1650
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and
the PC-9 cell line was obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank (Ibaraki, Japan). The PC-
9KGR cells, which contain deletions in the EGFR exon 19 and the T790M muta-
tion, were developed from PC-9 cells by stepwise exposure to gefitinib39. The PC-
9GXR cells, which contain deletions in the EGFR exon 19 and the T790M muta-
tion, were established at Kanazawa University (Kanazawa, Japan) from PC-9 cell
xenograft tumors in nude mice that had acquired resistance to gefitinib. All of these
cell lines were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640
medium (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin
(100 U/mL), and streptomycin (50 g/mL) in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C.
All cells were passaged for less than 3 months before being renewed with frozen,

 early-passage stocks. Cells were regularly screened for mycoplasma using a
MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Cell lines were authenticated by
DNA fingerprinting. Gefitinib, osimertinib, rociletinib, NPS1034, OSI-906,
buparlisib, trametinib, and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) were obtained from
Selleckchem (Houston, TX), and ASP2215 was kindly provided by Astellas Pharma
Inc. (Tokyo, Japan).
Human phospho-kinase antibody array. The relative levels of phosphorylation of
43 kinases and two related total proteins were measured using the Human
Phospho-Kinase Array Kit (R&D Systems), using a modification of the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10%
FBS and lysed in array buffer prior to reaching confluence. The arrays were blocked
with blocking buffer and incubated with 450 μg of cell lysate overnight at 4 °C. The
arrays were washed, incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
phospho-kinase antibody, and treated with SuperSignal West Dura Extended
Duration Substrate Enhanced Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL). Each experiment was independently performed at least twice.
Antibodies and western blotting. Protein aliquots of 25 μg each were resolved by
SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) or 1000 μg ali-
quots of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies.
The immune complexes were recovered with Protein G-Sepharose or Protein A-
Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories, California). Electrophoresed protein sam-
ples or immunoprecipitated samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Bio-Rad). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated
with blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature and overnight at
4 °C with primary antibodies to p-AXL (Tyr702), t-AXL, p-EGFR, p-MET, t-MET,
p-HER3 (Tyr1289), t-HER3, p-IGF-1R, t-IGF-1R, p-Akt (Ser473), t-Akt, E-cad-
herin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, ALDH1A1, CD44, β-actin (13E5) (1:1000 dilution;
Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), p-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), t-
Erk1/2, t-EGFR (1:1000 dilution, R&D Systems), SPRY4 (1:1000 dilution; Pro-
teintech, Rosemont, IL).
After washing three times, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with HRP-conjugated species-specific secondary antibody.
Immunoreactive bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Dura Extended
Duration Substrate Enhanced Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology).
All of the uncropped western blots with molecular weight indicated were presented
in Supplementary Figure 17. Each experiment was independently performed at
least three times.
Cell viability assay. Cell viability was determined using the MTT (3-(4,5-Dime-
thylthial-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazalium Bromide) dye reduction method. Briefly,
tumor cells (2–3×103 cells/100 μL/well) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% FBS were plated in 96-well plates and cultured with the indicated compound
for 72 h. After culturing, 50 μg of MTT solution (2 mg/mL, Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 h, the medium was removed,
and the dark blue crystals in each well were dissolved in 100 μL of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). Absorbance was measured with a microplate reader at a test
wavelength of 550 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. The percentage of
growth was determined relative to untreated controls. Experiments were repeated
at least three times with triplicate samples.
Transfection of siRNAs. Duplexed Silencer® Select siRNAs for AXL (s1845 and
s1846), EGFR (s565), and SPRY4 (s37826), and Stealth RNAi for MET
(HSS106478), SPRY4 (HSS130078), and HER3 (HSS140802) were purchased from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and transfected into cells using Lipofectamine RNAi-
MAX (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. In all
experiments, Silencer® Select siRNA for Negative Control no.1 (Invitrogen) was
used as the scrambled control. Knockdown of AXL, EGFR, MET, HER3, and SPRY4
were each confirmed by western blotting analysis. Each sample was tested in tri-
plicate with three independent experiments being performed.
Plasmid construction. 2×105 PC-9 cells were seeded in six-well plates. The next
day, the cells were transfected with 2.5 μg DNA of pIRESpuro2 AXL (Addgene)
using 5 μL Lipofectamine LTX Reagent (Invitrogen) and 2.5 μL PLUS Reagent
(Invitrogen) in 250 μL serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). After 4 h, cul-
ture medium were exchanged and 24 h later, puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was
added to the medium at the final concentration of 1 μg/mL.
Lentivirus and infections. In knockdown experiments, shRNAs in lentivirus
expression vectors included MISSION pLKO.1 constructs (Sigma-Aldrich) specific
for AXL (clones NM_021913.TRCN0000001037 and NM_021913.
TRCN0000001038), SPRY4 Precision LentiORF (PLOHS_ccsbBEn_04257), and a
scrambled control (SHC001).
Cell-line-derived xenograft (CDX) models. Suspensions of 5×106 cells were
injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 5-week-old male mice with severe
combined immunodeficiency obtained from Clea Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Once the
mean tumor volume reached approximately 100–300 mm3, five mice each were
injected with PC-9-shSCR or PC-9-shAXL, six with PC-9 cell-line-derived xeno-
grafts (CDX) at the time of initial treatment, and seven with PC-9 CDX at the time
of sequential therapy. Drugs were administered 5 or 7 days a week by oral gavage
and their body weight and general condition were monitored daily. Tumors were
measured twice weekly using calipers and their volumes were calculated as
width2 × length/2. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on
the Use of Laboratory Animals and the Advanced Science Research Center,
Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan (approval no. AP-122505). According to
institutional guidelines, surgery was performed after the animals were anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital and efforts were made to minimize animal suffering
Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Xenografts from a 42-year-old woman
with lung cancer containing the EGFR L858R mutation (TM00784) were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Female NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice aged 6–8 weeks were engrafted with tumor fragments
at passage P7 at the Jackson Laboratory. The mice were transferred to the animal
facility at Kanazawa University and randomized once their mean tumor volume
reached approximately 500 mm3 or 150–200 mm3. The study protocol was
approved by the Ethics Committee on the Use of Laboratory Animals and the
Advanced Science Research Center, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.
Cell-cycle assay. The cell-cycle was determined using a FACSCalibur flow cyt-
ometer (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) with a BD Pharmingen™ BrdU Flow Kit,
which allows for the detection and quantification of the percentage of cells in each
phase of cell cycle (G1, S, and G2-M) using labeled bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and
7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) staining. Each experiment independently repeated
at least three times.
DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from frozen tissue samples according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations with slight modifications. Briefly, each sample
was placed in a sterile tube with lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and
mechanically disrupted using a TissueLyser TL system (Qiagen, Venlo, Nether-
lands) for 1 min at 50 Hz. Proteinase K (Promega) and RNaseA (Sigma-Aldrich
Corporation, St. Louis, MO) were added to each sample and mixed by vortexing
(Scientific Industries Inc, Bohemia, NY, USA). The samples were then incubated
for 1 h at 56 °C. DNA was isolated from frozen tissue samples and cell lines using
Maxwell®16 Blood DNA Purification Kits and a Maxwell 16 Instrument (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was eluted in 50 μL of nuclease-
free water and the concentration measured using Quant-iT PicoGreen® dsDNA
Assay kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Patients. Specimens of tumors containing EGFR-activating mutations prior to the
initial treatments with EGFR-TKIs gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, or ASP8273 were
obtained from 46 lung adenocarcinoma patients hospitalized at Kanazawa Uni-
versity Hospital (Kanazawa, Japan), Niigata University Hospital (Niigata, Japan),
Niigata Cancer Center Hospital (Niigata, Japan), Nagasaki University Hospital
(Nagasaki, Japan), or the Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital (Naga-
saki, Japan). Specimens of tumors containing EGFR-activating mutations, prior to
treatment with osimertinib, were obtained from 11 lung adenocarcinoma patients
hospitalized at the Kanazawa University Hospital (Kanazawa, Japan), Japanese Red
Cross Kyoto Daiichi Hospital (Kyoto, Japan), Niigata University Hospital (Niigata,
Japan), and Niigata Cancer Center Hospital (Niigata, Japan). All patients were
participants in the Institutional Review Board of Kanazawa University, Niigata
University, Niigata Cancer Center, Nagasaki University, the Japanese Red Cross
Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, and Japanese Red Cross Kyoto Daiichi Hospital-
approved studies and all provided written informed consent.
Histological analyses of tumors. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sec-
tions (4 μm thick) were deparaffinized. Antigen was retrieved by microwaving the
tissue sections in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Proliferating cells were detected by
incubating the tissue sections with Ki-67 antibody (Clone MIB-1; DAKO Corp,
Glostrup, Denmark). Based on the expression patterns, tumor cells in tissue spe-
cimens were separately evaluated for expression of AXL using an anti-AXL anti-
body (1:200; goat polyclonal, R&D Systems). Because immunohistochemical
studies have shown that AXL is present primarily in the cytoplasm of cells and that
its staining varies in intensity, we quantified its expression as negative (0), weak
(1+), moderate (2+), and strong (3+) compared with vascular endothelial cells as
an internal control18. After incubation of the specimens with the secondary anti-
body and treatment with using the Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA), peroxidase activity was visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as
a chromogen. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Quantification of immunohistochemistry results. The five areas containing the
highest numbers of positively stained cells within each section were selected for
histologic quantitation using light or fluorescent microscopy at a 400-fold
magnification.

 Statistical analysis. Data from the MTT assays and tumor progression of xeno-
grafts were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) and as means ± standard
error (SE), respectively. The statistical significance of differences was analyzed
using one-way ANOVA and Spearman rank correlations. PFS and 95% confidence
intervals were determined using the Kaplan−Meier method and compared using
the log-rank test. HRs of clinical variables for PFS were determined using a uni-
variate Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism Ver. 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA),
with a two-sided P value less than 0.05 being considered statistically significant.
