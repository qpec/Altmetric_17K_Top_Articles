Abstract
Background: Healthcare systems internationally are under an ever-increasing demand for services that must be
delivered in an efficient, effective and affordable manner. Several patient-related and organisational factors influence
health-care expenditure and utilisation, including oropharyngeal dysphagia. Here, we present a systematic review of
the literature and meta-analyses investigating how oropharyngeal dysphagia influences healthcare utilisation
through length of stay (LOS) and cost.
Methods: Using a standardised approach, eight databases were systematically searched for relevant articles
reporting on oropharyngeal dysphagia attributable inpatient LOS and healthcare costs through June 2016. Study
methodologies were critically appraised and where appropriate, extracted LOS data were analysed in an overall
summary statistic.
Results: Eleven studies reported on cost data, and 23 studies were included reporting on LOS data. Descriptively,
the presence of dysphagia added 40.36% to health care costs across studies. Meta-analysis of all-cause admission
data from 13 cohort studies revealed an increased LOS of 2.99 days (95% CI, 2.7, 3.3). A subgroup analysis revealed
that admission for stroke resulted in higher and more variable LOS of 4.73 days (95% CI, 2.7, 7.2). Presence of
dysphagia across all causes was also statistically significantly different regardless of geographical location: Europe
(8.42 days; 95% CI, 4.3; 12.5), North America (3.91 days; 95% CI, 3.3, 4.5). No studies included in meta-analysis were
conducted in Asia.
Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrated that the presence of oropharyngeal dysphagia significantly
increases healthcare utilisation and cost, highlighting the need to recognise oropharyngeal dysphagia as an
important contributor to pressure on healthcare systems.

Background
Healthcare systems internationally are under an ever
increasing demand for services that must be delivered in
an effective and affordable manner. Simultaneously, there
is increasing pressure to optimise patient outcomes and
meet clinical and operational benchmarks that ensure
service quality [1–3]. As healthcare expenditures have in-
creased, research investigating affordability, cost-containment
policies and features of healthcare utilisation has become
more prominent in the literature. This has identified
several patient-related and organisational factors that
influence healthcare expenditure [3]. Oropharyngeal dys-
phagia is one such patient-related symptom that is common
to several complex medical conditions, and also influences
organisational factors related to hospital procedures, avail-
ability and training of staff and the application of clinical
pathways [4, 5]. However, there has been no systematic
investigation of how oropharyngeal dysphagia influences
healthcare utilisation and cost.
The contributors to expenditure and utilisation in the
provision of healthcare are complex and multilayered,
and consensus is lacking about definitions for these, or

 measures to capture them accurately. Previous studies
have often measured cost of care through patient-related
factors including Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) models,
patient acuity and hospital length of stay (LOS) [1–3].
These measures have been criticised as they do not
incorporate organisational factors including the intensity
and coordination of patient care, or account for under-
reported symptoms such as oropharyngeal dysphagia
[2, 3, 6]. Measuring LOS as a proxy for healthcare ex-
penditure is particularly problematic, as the intensity of
patient care has been shown to increase as LOS is short-
ened [3]. However, identifying how patient factors contrib-
ute to hospital related expenditure remains important to
plan for demand and activity organisation, and LOS con-
tinues to provide utilisation information of relevance for
hospital bed management and capacity planning [1].
There are several symptoms common to a range of con-
ditions that are known to increase health care utilisation
through patient and organisational factors. For example,
malnutrition [7], severe anemia [8] and delirium [9] are
each associated with increased LOS in certain populations.
One such symptom that has not been systematically in-
vestigated in relation to its influence on LOS or cost is
oropharyngeal dysphagia, or swallowing impairment. The
presence of dysphagia is associated with reduced quality
of life [10], malnutrition [11], dehydration [12], and poor
healthcare outcomes [13] including aspiration pneumo-
nia, which is the second leading cause of death in the
elderly [14]. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is a direct and crit-
ical symptom of a range of conditions known to contrib-
ute to high healthcare expenditure, including stroke [15],
traumatic brain injury [16] and head and neck cancer [17].
In many of these conditions, the presence of dysphagia
predicts greater severity of disease and poorer health out-
comes, which are also correlated with greater utilisation of
healthcare [3]. In studies related to these conditions,
oropharyngeal dysphagia is often a secondary contextual
measure that is not commonly reported as a primary out-
come. Therefore, data about healthcare cost and utilisation
related to oropharyngeal dysphagia is difficult to access, in-
consistently measured and reported, and subject to variable
research foci and methodologies.
However, a recent study has quantified the impact of
dysphagia on the cost of healthcare and LOS in the United
States of America (USA) by analysing International Classi-
fication of Disease (ICD)-9 codes from national inpatient
discharge data. The extracted data did not discern patients
with oropharyngeal dysphagia from those with esophageal
dysphagia, instead treating these as a single condition.
Overall, inpatients with dysphagia were noted to increase
LOS by 8.8 days and cost 42% more per admission than
patients without dysphagia [18]. However, the assessment
and management of oropharyngeal and esophageal dys-
phagia differ substantially due to their aetiologies and
the use of discrete pharmacological and surgical interven-
tions for esophageal dysphagia. Furthermore, organisational
factors related to oropharyngeal dysphagia include complex
assessment and management guidelines, multidisciplinary
support needs, ongoing reliance on modified diet or supple-
mentary feeding and increased likelihood of discharge into
a skilled nursing facility [15] that are under-recognised
contributors to increased direct and indirect healthcare
utilisation. As such, the financial consequences of oropha-
ryngeal dysphagia on any healthcare system are likely to be
substantial and require systematic evaluation that is distinct
from esophageal dysphagia.
Quantifying the impact of oropharyngeal dysphagia
on healthcare utilisation is critical to enable managers,
clinicians and patients to advocate for efficient and
evidence-based strategies to manage, or prevent its det-
rimental
sequelae
and
may
facilitate
appropriate
allocation of resources within healthcare systems [3].
To provide more information to quantify the impact of
oropharyngeal dysphagia, the purpose of the current study
was to systematically review findings of studies on health
care expenditure associated with oropharyngeal dysphagia
through the parallel review of studies that reported on
cost and hospital LOS. In this review, reported monetary
costs and LOS were variables considered to proxy for
healthcare expenditure as these may be directly translated
into different healthcare systems
internationally and
provide information about hospital utilisation to inform
contemporary hospital resourcing.
Methods
This systematic review was conducted using a standar-
dised methodology and critical appraisal tools from the
Joanna Briggs Institute [19]. Study identification was
reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement
[20] and meta-analysis was conducted using The Cochrane
Collaboration RevMan 5.3 software [21]. The presence of
heterogeneity in the meta-analyses was determined using
the standard Chi-square test. The degree of heterogeneity
was assessed using I2.
Objectives
The review sought to synthesise the best available evidence
in relation to inpatient care related LOS and care setting
financial costs for patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia,
from the viewpoints of both patients and healthcare pro-
viders. More specifically, the review questions were:
1. What is the inpatient admission related
expenditure, in monetary terms, of patients with
oropharyngeal dysphagia, compared with their
etiology-matched peers without dysphagia?

 2. What is the impact on the length of inpatient care
stay, of patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia,
compared with their etiology-matched peers with-
out dysphagia?
Definitions
The following definitions were utilised for this review:
Cost: reference to financial cost or economic impact in
any care setting.
Length of stay (LOS): mean or median number of patient
days between a formal admission to, and a formal
separation from a hospital care environment [22].
Dysphagia: reference to a patient group with impaired oral
and/or pharyngeal swallowing (oropharyngeal dysphagia).
Inclusion criteria
Types of participants
This review considered studies of adult patients, of any
ethnic background, with or without co-morbidities, ad-
mitted to an inpatient care setting with any diagnosis.
Those studies that included patients with swallowing dis-
order or oropharyngeal dysphagia, and reference to either
LOS in any inpatient hospital facility (acute or rehabilitation
hospital setting) OR reference to financial or economic cost
in any care setting were considered for inclusion.
Studies were excluded if they sampled pediatric pa-
tients; investigated patients with esophageal dysphagia;
or where LOS or cost related to, or were not corrected for,
tracheostomy or a surgical intervention (e.g. pharyngeal
pouch repair) rather than the oropharyngeal dysphagia
itself. Papers that examined cost or LOS of an intervention
and/or
tools
for
managing
oropharyngeal
dysphagia
(e.g. costs of dysphagia screening), rather than generalised
differences in cost or LOS for patient groups with and
without oropharyngeal dysphagia were also excluded.
Type of outcomes
Studies were considered to address Review question 1 if
they referred to financial or economic costs of oropha-
ryngeal dysphagia in any care setting, where these costs
were reported with a monetary value in any currency for
comparative patient groups with and without dysphagia.
Studies were considered for Review question 2 if they
reported mean or median length of inpatient stay in any
hospital facility for patient groups with and without
oropharyngeal dysphagia.
Types of studies
This review considered any primary research studies
utilising quantitative study designs that met the inclusion
criteria, including, but not limited to: randomised controlled
trials (RCTs), cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and case
controlled studies.
Search strategy
The search strategy was developed with a medical librar-
ian (SH) using subject headings and text words relevant to
dysphagia, costs and LOS. The search strategy was tested
and finalised in Medline (Ovid) and then translated into
the following databases using the equivalent subject
headings, all text words, and with syntax adapted ac-
cordingly: PubMed (non-indexed subset only), Scopus,
CINAHL (Ebsco), PsycInfo (Ovid), Cochrane Library, Web
of Science, and ProQuest. The search was limited to
English language publications. No date limits were applied
to the search, as it was anticipated that few studies would
include comparable groups with and without oropharyn-
geal dysphagia. The searches were run during February
2016, and the results were exported and de-duplicated in
Endnote X8 bibliographic software (http://endnote.com/).
The full search strategies for each database are detailed in
Additional file 1. The reference lists of all identified
relevant studies and articles were hand searched for
additional studies.
In an attempt to address publication bias, a grey literature
search was undertaken to identify relevant unpublished
literature. The internet was searched via Google, limiting to
PDFs and using search terms dysphagia and cost/s. The
first 200 results were scanned for relevant studies. The
following websites were also searched: Australian Institute
of Health and Welfare (AIHW), Opendoar and Trove.
A PRISMA flow diagram (see Fig. 1) was used to report
the number of records identified by the searches, the
number after deduplication, papers identified through
other means, the number included after initial screening,
and the papers excluded and reasons for this.
Method of the review
Study selection
Identified studies were assessed for relevance to the re-
view based on information in the title, abstract and key-
words by four independent reviewers. Pairs of reviewers
(SA and SD, JM and SW) independently screened half of
the abstracts, and then compared and discussed those
selected for inclusion and exclusion until consensus was
achieved. A third reviewer was consulted if consensus
could not be reached. Articles that appeared to meet the
inclusion criteria were retrieved for full text review. The
same pairs of reviewers independently reviewed half of
these retrieved articles according to the inclusion criteria,
and then compared these to determine whether they
would be included for further analysis.
Critical appraisal and data extraction
Pairs of reviewers undertook critical appraisal of the in-
cluded studies (SA and SD, JM and SW), utilising stan-
dardised and validated critical appraisal tools. Appraisal

 tools were specific to study design and are freely avail-
able [19].
Assessment of methodological quality focused on the
appraisal of the sampling method, measurement of dyspha-
gia as the exposure of interest, recognition of confounding
variables, measurement of LOS and cost outcomes, and
the statistical analysis employed. Discussion occurred until
consensus was reached between the pairs of authors about
the rating for each item. Subsequently, the Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evalu-
ations (GRADE) method was used to give a rating of the
overall quality of each study [23]. Two authors (JM and
SW) assigned a GRADE rating of High, Moderate, Low or
Very low after reaching consensus. As per the GRADE
method, quality is considered Low for observational stud-
ies but can be upgraded one step if the effect size is large,
there is a clear dose-response relationship or when con-
founders are fully considered. A data extraction tool was
developed and piloted (by JM and SW) to extract all rele-
vant data about LOS and cost from included studies.
Whilst data were extracted from all studies that met the
inclusion criteria, those judged by the authors as utilising
less reliable or valid measures of oropharyngeal dysphagia,
in accordance with internationally recognised best practice
recommendations for the assessment of the presence of
oropharyngeal dysphagia [24], were rated using the GRADE
method as of lower quality for narrative analysis. Extracted
data is summarised in Table 1.
Data analysis
Where appropriate, extracted data was combined in ran-
dom effects meta-analysis, as we anticipated that the data
would be highly variable [25].
Whilst all included studies reported LOS in days, the
consistency of reporting was variable. No study provided
information about the exact parameters that defined LOS,
so for the purpose of this review, we used the AIHW def-
inition: LOS is measured in patient days; and is the period
of admitted patient care between a formal admission and
formal separation [22].
Reported costs also varied widely, ranging from costs
of the primary hospital admission only to total health
care costs from diagnosis to end of life. Given this vari-
ation, meta-analysis of the cost findings was not consid-
ered appropriate so findings have been tabulated (Table 2)
and discussed in narrative summary.

 LOS data is presented in Table 3. We selected stud-
ies including patients with the common diagnosis of
stroke for meta-analysis, as stroke-related dysphagia is
commonly researched, known to increase medical acuity
[12], and is the subject of standard, agreed international
guidelines for acute dysphagia management [5]. As other
diagnostic groups are less subject to consistent guidelines
for dysphagia management, only cohort studies that sam-
pled patients with stroke (either ischaemic or haemor-
rhagic) were selected for meta-analysis to determine
whether dysphagia significantly contributed to an in-
creased LOS (Table 4 and Fig. 2). As the impact for stroke
was striking, and dysphagia is a symptom common to
many conditions, a subsequent ‘all causes’ meta-analysis
was conducted to determine whether this finding general-
ised to more diverse primary diagnoses and study designs.
This second meta-analysis statistically combined data
from all included studies that report LOS data related
to oropharyngeal dysphagia regardless of study design
(see Fig. 3), and then considered the impact of cohort
study design (see Fig. 4a) and cross-sectional study design
(see Fig. 4b) in subgroup analysis. Finally, as the included
studies were prominently from either Northern America
or Europe, we grouped studies together by region in fur-
ther sub-group analysis (Fig. 5).
Results
Description of studies
Removal of duplicates from the original searches yielded
4356 studies. After verification, 120 studies were identi-
fied as potentially eligible for inclusion. Based on the full
text review, studies were excluded at this point if dyspha-
gia type was not oropharyngeal, if oropharyngeal dyspha-
gia was not reported as a separate LOS or cost outcome,
or if a comparator was not included.
Sixty studies were critically appraised and 29 studies
were included for analysis (see Fig. 1). Studies excluded fol-
lowing critical appraisal had no extractable data. Of the 29
included studies, 23 were cohort studies, 4 cross-sectional
studies and 2 were case series. Separately, cost analysis was
included in 11 studies, and LOS was included in 23 studies,
but 7 studies reported both cost and LOS.
Studies sampled adults with an acquired condition
who were admitted to hospital for medical or surgical
management. Clinical diagnoses varied, however; 13 stud-
ies evaluated outcomes for stroke patients, five studies
included patients with head and neck cancer, three studies
examined patient outcomes following spinal surgery and
two post-cardiac surgery. Individual studies included par-
ticipants with dementia, anorexia nervosa and traumatic
brain injury. The methods used to diagnose oropharyngeal
dysphagia varied between studies; some utilised clinical
assessment and others extracted data from ICD-9 coding.
Similar variability was observed for cost outcomes, as data
sources included USA Medicare billing records, USA In-
patient Health Care Cost and Utilisation Project or health
insurance billing records.
Methodological quality
Critical appraisal of the literature
Assessment of methodological quality is summarised
in Table 1. Of the 23 included cohort studies, 15 collected
data retrospectively from databases or chart reviews, 7 col-
lected data prospectively, and one conference abstract was
unclear about data collection methods [26]. All studies re-
cruited participants from a similar, well-defined population
and inclusion criteria but only 11 demonstrated adequately
that their cohorts were similar at baseline. Fourteen mea-
sured oropharyngeal dysphagia with methods the authors
considered as valid and reliable; through swallow screen-
ing, speech-language pathology clinical assessment or in-
strumental assessment [24]. The remaining cohort studies
(n = 8) used ICD-9 coding to identify cohorts. Few studies
confirmed the absence of dysphagia in participants prior to
the study. Many cohort studies (n = 17) identified relevant
confounders, including age, stroke severity, comorbidity
complexity but only half of these (n = 9) used the appropri-
ate statistical methods to manage these. All studies mea-
sured cost and/or length of stay outcomes in well-defined,
reliable and valid ways and used appropriate statistics for
primary outcomes.
As all studies included in this systematic review were
observational studies, they commenced with a quality rating
of Low according to GRADE. Eleven (11) of the 23 cohort
studies were upgraded to Moderate following critical ap-
praisal, as they had relatively large sample sizes and consid-
ered confounders in the statistical analysis. The remainder
of the cohort studies (× 12) along with the cross-sectional
studies (× 4) and the case series (× 2) were rated as Low
quality. No papers were excluded on the basis of methodo-
logical quality.
Findings of the review
Dysphagia attributable costs
In total, seven cohort studies and four cross-sectional
studies with a range of clinical diagnoses, including stroke,
head and neck cancer and post-surgical care, were in-
cluded for descriptive analysis of cost as an outcome
(Table 2). Across these eleven studies, including three lon-
gitudinal studies, data were reported for the billing years
1998–2012 and included a total sample of 1,850,406 indi-
viduals of whom 46,013 presented with dysphagia (2.49%).
Ten studies were conducted in the USA, one in Taiwan,
and all reported in $USD. Settings included surgical wards
(n = 5), acute care (n = 3) and inpatient rehabilitation
(n = 1). The mean attributable cost of dysphagia across all
eleven studies was USD$12,715, representing an increase
in dysphagia-related expenditure compared to the relevant

 non-dysphagic comparator groups of 40.36%. The difference
in cost for patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia compared
to those without was reported as significant in nine of the
eleven studies, and not reported in the remaining two
studies.
Impact of dysphagia on LOS
In total, seventeen cohort studies, four cross-sectional studies
and two case series were included that were conducted in a
range of countries, most prominently the USA (15), followed
by the United Kingdom (2) and Sweden (2), and single stud-
ies each from Switzerland, Italy and Canada. One conference
abstract did not report the country of origin [26]. LOS data
varied across the studies, which was unsurprising as the stud-
ies related to different research foci, and included patient
groups with a range of clinical diagnoses (Table 3). Across
these studies, data were collected from 79,378,058 individ-
uals, including 318,506 (0.4%) with dysphagia.
Fig. 3 Dysphagia increases LOS, regardless of admission cause
Fig. 2 Meta-analysis of dysphagia attributable LOS data reported in cohort studies of patients presenting with stroke
Attrill et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2018) 18:594 
Page 12 of 18
 Of the 23 studies, four reported median LOS, and 14
either explicitly reported mean LOS, or reported statistical
methods that required a mean value. For the remaining five
studies that did not report a method of LOS calculation, we
have assumed a mean value, as this was supported by
contextual information included in the published report.
As shown in Table 3, the 23 included studies reported on
26 admission settings, as three studies analyzed LOS for
two separate settings [27–29], for example, LOS was
reported for stroke unit, intensive care unit and general
ward admissions. Total LOS was utilised for these studies.
Dysphagia related LOS was significantly longer in 21 of the
26 reported analyses for p ≤ 0.05. Of the remaining five
settings, three were not statistically significant, and in two
the p value was not reported.
Meta-analysis of LOS data for patients admitted for
stroke, with and without dysphagia
There were ten studies that commonly included LOS
data for patients with stroke. However, only cohort
Fig. 4 a Analysis of cohort studies. b. Analysis of cross section studies
Attrill et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2018) 18:594 
Page 13 of 18
 studies that sampled patients with stroke were selected
for meta-analysis to reduce variation. The sample size
and variance of the six studies that reported sufficient
data for statistical combination were varied (as indicated
by the confidence intervals (CIs) and I2 value) (Table 4;
Fig. 2). All six studies showed an increased LOS for indi-
viduals admitted for stroke if they also had dysphagia. In
all except one study [26] the increased LOS was statisti-
cally significant. Overall, based on six cohort studies and
a sample of 3879 individuals, dysphagia added almost
five extra days in hospital (a mean of 4.73 days more,
95% CI: 2.23, 7.23).
Meta-analysis of LOS data for ‘all-cause’ admissions
LOS data from eighteen included studies were subse-
quently pooled regardless of diagnostic grouping or study
design, to provide a broad overview about the relative
impact of dysphagia on LOS. The meta-analysis in Fig. 3
highlights considerable
variance within some of the
included studies (as indicated by the CI’s), however, all
studies reported an increased LOS for individuals with
dysphagia. Data from three studies [26, 27, 30] did not
contribute to this meta-analysis as they reported only mean
LOS without standard deviation or standard error of the
mean. Two studies [31, 32] that reported median and
Fig. 5 a Analysis by region: Northern America. b. Analysis by region: Europe

Page 14 of 18
 interquartile range values were also not included in the
meta-analysis. Overall, based on eighteen studies and a
total sample of 79,377,199 individuals, patients with
dysphagia, who were 0.4% of the sample, added approxi-
mately four extra days in hospital (a mean of 3.98 days
longer, 95% CI: 3.41, 4.55) compared to individuals with
no dysphagia (Fig. 3). This pooled data included the stud-
ies in the stroke meta-analysis that comprised 25.9% of
the sample. However, meta-analysis of ‘all cause’ studies
that excluded these stroke studies also identified that the
presence of dysphagia increased LOS (a mean of 4.27 days
longer, 95% CI: 3.6, 4.93).
Meta-analysis of LOS data for ‘all-cause’ admissions:
Impact of study design
To investigate the variance in the data, impact of study
design was considered in sub-group analysis. Dysphagia
contributed an additional three days to LOS (2.99 days;
2.72, 3.25) when the data from thirteen cohort studies,
representing 77,608,593 participants was combined in
meta-analysis (Fig. 4a). Dysphagia contributed an additional
two days to LOS (2.18 days: 95% CI: 0.83, 3.53) when data
from four cross sectional studies, representing 176,806 par-
ticipants was combined in meta-analysis (Fig. 4b).
Meta-analysis of LOS data for ‘all-cause’ admissions:
impact of geographical region
As studies from Northern America were prominent in
the data, sub-group analysis of these compared with
European studies was conducted to determine if regional
differences existed. Of the twenty three included studies,
sixteen were conducted in North America. Data from
thirteen of these studies (79,373,273 participants) was
combined in meta-analysis (see Fig. 5). Dysphagia added
four days to LOS (3.91 days; 95% CI: 3.28, 4.54). Seven
studies were conducted in Europe. Data from five of
these studies (3958 participants) were combined in
meta-analysis (see Fig. 5b). Dysphagia added eight days
to LOS (8.42 days; 95% CI: 4.30, 12.54).
Discussion
This systematic review evaluated the impact of oropharyn-
geal dysphagia on healthcare expenditure and patient
LOS. Although varying in magnitude, overall expenditure
measured via monetary cost increased by 40.36% in pa-
tients with oropharyngeal dysphagia compared to their
non-dysphagic counterparts, a finding that was consistent
across years and underlying clinical presentations. Analo-
gously, the presence of oropharyngeal dysphagia added
between two and eight extra days to hospital LOS, regard-
less of reason for admission, study design utilised, or
whether the region in which the study was conducted was
Northern America or Europe.
Quality of the reviewed literature
Critical appraisal of the included studies revealed several
methodological constraints that warrant discussion, and
which limit the interpretation of the findings of this re-
view. Overall, nearly half of the included cohort studies
(11/23) were graded as moderate quality based on robust
critical appraisal, consideration of confounders in the ana-
lysis and relatively large sample sizes. The remaining co-
hort studies (12/23), as well as four cross-sectional studies
and two case series were graded as low quality. Thus, the
overall evidence captured within this systematic review is
not considered strong. This lack of strongly ranked studies
may be partly attributed to the type of research questions
posed, as evaluating healthcare costs and LOS are obser-
vational analyses by their nature. Therefore, prospective
cohort studies with pre-identified confounders that are
appropriately managed statistically are perhaps the most
appropriate design, even though these are conventionally
regarded as “moderate” with respect to the quality of evi-
dence. It is unlikely that RCTs, universally considered to
produce a higher quality of evidence, would be specifically
designed to evaluate expenditure and LOS, although fu-
ture RCTs may now add these variables as outcomes
where appropriate.
The approaches to identify the presence or absence of
oropharyngeal dysphagia varied across the included stud-
ies; 15/23 cohort studies assessed oropharyngeal dysphagia
using direct clinical assessment, either through dysphagia
screening, speech pathology clinical assessment or instru-
mental assessment. Different assessment processes were
implemented, including factors that impeded study val-
idity such as transparency of process, timing and staff
training for dysphagia screening as well as timing and pro-
cesses for speech pathology clinical assessment [31, 33].
The remaining eight cohort studies derived data from
ICD-9 codes that relied on the correctness of administra-
tive coding for oropharyngeal dysphagia at discharge,
compared with directly confirming the presence of dys-
phagia. Data sources for these studies also varied substan-
tially, including insurer datasets consulted retrospectively,
and summarised data of hospital-incurred expenses col-
lected prospectively. The potential for coding errors or
omissions that influence entry and maintenance of
these data sources may have confounded the outcomes
of the reviewed studies by under-estimating the frequency
of oropharyngeal dysphagia [18] and therefore the factors
related to healthcare utilisation that were reported.
Healthcare costs related to oropharyngeal dysphagia
Whilst all included studies reported cost in $USD, the
studies included for cost analysis varied in the clinical
populations, contexts and time points for cost measure-
ment. These ranged from costs incurred during hospital
admission, to costs from diagnosis of a condition until
Attrill et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2018) 18:594 
Page 15 of 18
 death. For these reasons, meta-analysis of cost data was
not conducted. Despite these potential confounders and
sources of variability, results from narrative analysis of the
included studies indicated that patients presenting with
oropharyngeal dysphagia incurred 40.36% greater costs
than those without dysphagia. This compares favourably
with the 42% increase identified in Patel and colleagues’
[18] USA study of patients with dysphagia of oropharyn-
geal and esophageal origin, despite differences in the
population, underlying condition, year or country of origin
of the studies. Several studies included discussion about
oropharyngeal dysphagia-related expenditure, which was
attributed to i. often repeated, diagnostic procedures such
as videofluoroscopic evaluations of swallowing and
chest x-rays, ii. management of complications of oropha-
ryngeal dysphagia, such as malnutrition or pneumonia, iii.
increased multi-disciplinary involvement over a longer
period of stay in hospital, and iv. use of consumables such
as enteral feeding or modified food and fluids. The finding
that presence of oropharyngeal dysphagia resulted in in-
creased expenditure regardless of diagnosis highlights the
often under-recognised magnitude of this patient-related
factor on healthcare systems and resources. This un-
derscores the need for research on robust assessment,
treatment approaches and practice guidelines that are more
inclusive of the range of conditions that result in oropha-
ryngeal dysphagia.
LOS related to oropharyngeal dysphagia
It is likely that this increased expenditure is, at least in
part, associated with the increased LOS related to oro-
pharyngeal dysphagia that was a consistent finding of
the included studies. Each of the seven included studies
that reported data for both cost and LOS for patients
with oropharyngeal dysphagia reported significant differ-
ences for both variables compared with patients without
dysphagia. Whilst measures of LOS do not reflect the
intensity of care or organisational processes that contrib-
ute to care [3], these studies suggest that the presence of
oropharyngeal dysphagia increases hospital expenditure
and utilisation across the clinical populations studied.
Initial meta-analysis was conducted about the impact
of stroke-related dysphagia on LOS, which provided data
to support the broad implementation of existing stroke
practice guidelines for hospital based assessment and inter-
vention practices for stroke-related dysphagia [5]. This
stroke specific meta-analysis demonstrated that oropharyn-
geal dysphagia increased LOS by 4.73 days, extending in-
formation about the known impact of stroke-related
dysphagia on patient outcomes and healthcare utilisation
[13, 34]. However, this review was unable to determine
whether the implementation of stroke guidelines influ-
enced LOS, as included studies rarely reported their dys-
phagia procedures in accordance with these guidelines. As
uptake of stroke guidelines become more commonly em-
bedded in hospital procedures, future research should also
identify whether their implementation influence measures
of hospital expenditure.
The significant finding of the stroke data meta-analysis
informed the decision to conduct a meta-analysis that
was inclusive of all causes. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is a
common patient-related factor of many conditions that
is associated with greater medical acuity, and is subject
to complex organisational procedures to reduce adverse
sequelae, coordinate multi-disciplinary team interven-
tions, and manage discharge outcomes. However, as data
about how dysphagia independently contributes to LOS
across conditions have not been reported, it is currently
difficult to substantiate resources to specifically manage
oropharyngeal dysphagia. In this study, meta-analysis of
the ‘all-cause’ data indicated that the presence of oropha-
ryngeal dysphagia increased LOS by four days, and this
was maintained when data from the stroke meta-analysis
was removed. In the ‘all cause’ cohort studies that were
less variable, oropharyngeal dysphagia contributed an
additional three days. The results of this ‘all-cause’
meta-analysis suggest that oropharyngeal dysphagia is
a factor that increases LOS independently of underlying
clinical diagnoses, adding valuable specific information for
planning and resourcing of hospital services. However,
this result differed substantially from Patel and colleagues’
[18] finding that dysphagia increased mean LOS by
8.8 days. Patel and colleagues combined oropharyngeal
and esophageal dysphagia data from administrative coding
that is likely to underestimate subclinical or less severe
dysphagia presentation, and may also be influenced by
contextual USA hospital admission practices where the
study was conducted. These factors may have influenced
the disparity in LOS reported, compared with the current
study, but further research is needed to elucidate these
differences.
Both patient-related and organisation-related factors
are known to contribute to healthcare utilisation and re-
sources [3]. The results of this systematic review suggest
that oropharyngeal dysphagia, which is a patient-related
factor subject to varied organisation-related manage-
ment procedures, increases both LOS and cost across a
range of clinical conditions. Further, critical appraisal
highlighted the varied nature of procedures for dysphagia
identification and management reported in the included
studies. The results therefore provide much needed infor-
mation about the independent impact of oropharyngeal
dysphagia to support the development of clear guide-
lines and procedures to optimise and resource clinical
pathways. Implementing these may reduce healthcare util-
isation through reducing the adverse patient outcomes and
medical management associated with oropharyngeal dys-
phagia. Strategies identified for specific clinical populations,

 such as stroke, that may have application within broader
patient contexts include:
i.
Implementation of validated dysphagia screening
tools to allow the early detection of dysphagia.
ii. Early implementation of dysphagia management in
line with current practice for acute stroke in several
countries, including the USA, United Kingdom,
Canada and Australia, with the aim of minimising
other associated negative health outcomes such as
dehydration and malnutrition as well as aspiration
pneumonia.
iii. Recognition of dysphagia as a quality indicator with
regular auditing and benchmarking of
implementation of screening, management and
patient outcomes.
Limitations
As with all systematic reviews, the current study was
limited to the inclusion of publically available sources.
Whilst the search strategy included both published and
grey literature, the potential for publication bias remains as
no grey literature was identified. The review also intended
to include studies about dysphagia-related healthcare
utilisation from the perspectives of both patients and
healthcare providers. However, no studies with informa-
tion about independent patient costs were identified. This
reveals an important gap in our understanding, as oropha-
ryngeal dysphagia is often chronic in its presentation, and
dysphagia-related costs to individuals that extend be-
yond their admission to hospital are likely to be sub-
stantial. Similarly, the review sought a global viewpoint of
dysphagia-related healthcare utilisation, but the studies
identified were prominently from Northern America and
Europe. Subgroup analysis indicated substantial regional
LOS variation between these two groups that perhaps re-
flect differences in approaches and systems for healthcare.
However, the very small proportion of included studies
that were not from Northern America also suggest that
more research from a broader range of countries and ser-
vice settings is needed to inform the development of
guidelines and treatment approaches for dysphagia that
are genuinely transferable to global healthcare contexts.
Additionally, as only a single study was included for cost
analysis that was not derived from USA data, generalizable
conclusions cannot be drawn about LOS or cost.
Conclusions
In this systematic review, we highlight the significant im-
pact of oropharyngeal dysphagia, a symptom of many com-
plex medical conditions, on healthcare expenditure. While
there are limitations with regard to the quality of the exist-
ing literature, this review demonstrates that the presence of
oropharyngeal dysphagia significantly increases both cost
and LOS. This highlights the need to recognise oropharyn-
geal dysphagia as an important contributor to pressure on
current healthcare systems. Organisational strategies that
facilitate the early identification, timely and evidence-based
management of oropharyngeal dysphagia across any clin-
ical population will likely result in significant reductions
in dysphagia-related negative health outcomes, and conse-
quently LOS and attributable healthcare expenditure.
