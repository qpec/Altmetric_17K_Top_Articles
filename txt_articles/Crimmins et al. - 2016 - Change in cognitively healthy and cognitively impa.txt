Objective: To determine how cognitively healthy and cognitively impaired life expectancy have changed from
2000 to 2010 among American men and women 65 years of age and over.
Methods: The prevalence of dementia, cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), and normal cognition
is determined from nationally representative data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Mortality
rates are from U.S. Decennial Life Table for 2000 and the U.S. annual life table for 2010. Life expectancy by
cognitive status is estimated using the Sullivan method.
Results: Most of the increase in life expectancy has been concentrated in cognitively healthy years in this 10
year period. The increase in expected years cognitively intact at age 65, which exceeded that in total life
expectancy, was 1.8 for men and 1.6 for women.
Conclusion: This study provides evidence suggesting that there has been a compression of cognitive morbidity.
1. Introduction
In recent years a question posed by those interested in health trends
has been “Are we living longer healthy lives as well as longer lives?” If
we prolong life after the onset of disease or disability, life with disease
and disability can be lengthened which is not really an improvement in
population health. Because decreases in mortality are increasingly
concentrated at older ages, and because dementia is normally a disease
with onset in old age, change in mortality and change in dementia
prevalence interact to affect the length of cognitively intact and
cognitively impaired life expectancy. Length of life with dementia or
with cognitive loss provides a good assessment of the burden of
dementia and the potential value of interventions to prevent and delay
cognitive loss.
Recent reports from England have shown increases in the length of
cognitively healthy life expectancy at age 65 that are almost as great as
the increase in life expectancy for men and greater than the increase in
life expectancy for women (Jagger et al., 2015). In addition, there have
been a number of reports of reductions in the prevalence of dementia
both in the United States and in other countries (De Rotrou et al.,
2013; Gerstorf et al., 2015; Larson, Yaffe, & Langa, 2013; Langa et al.,
2008; Satizabal et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016). These lead us to expect
increases in cognitively healthy life.
On the other hand, life expectancy increase in the U.S. has been
relatively slow compared to that of other countries, particularly for
women, which could affect relative change in the length of life with
cognitive impairment (Glei, Meslé, & Vallin, 2010). An examination of
life expectancy with and without impaired cognitive functioning for
men and women in the U.S. in the 1990s indicated that women had
longer life expectancy with cognitive impairment than men primarily
because of their longer total life expectancy (Suthers, Kim,
&
Crimmins, 2003). The age-specific differences between men and
women in the prevalence of cognitive impairment were not significant.
A new look at gender differences in new cohorts with more education
and using newly derived measures of dementia and cognitive impair-
ment without dementia (CIND) is warranted.
In this analysis, we examine changes from 2000 to 2010 in the
length of life with good cognition, with dementia and with cognitive
impairment but without dementia (CIND). Data from the nationally
representative survey of older Americans, the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS), are used to estimate the prevalence of cognitive states
among those 65 and older at the two dates. This is the first study to
provide national estimates of life expectancy with dementia and CIND
for the United States.

 2. Data and methods
2.1. Data resources
Estimates of cognitive life expectancy require information on
mortality and cognitive state at each date. Mortality data for this
analysis are from the U.S. National Vital Statistics, the decennial life
table for 2000 and the annual life table for 2010.
Data from the 2000 and 2010 Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
for those 65+ were used to obtain the prevalence of cognitive states ten
years apart. These data included 10,374 participants in 2000 and 9,995
in 2010 who were age 65 or older. These samples consist of both
community-dwelling and nursing home residents, and both self- and
proxy respondents. At each wave from 2000 to 2010, 88% or 89% of
those scheduled for interview in the HRS were actually interviewed
(Health and Retirement Study, 2011, for 2000 to 2008; Personal
communication from HRS for 2010). Survey procedures and sample
characteristics were consistent at the two dates. In 2000, 11.9% of the
responses were provided by proxies; in 2010, this was true for 9.3% of
responses. In 2000, 3.8% and in 2010, 4.3% of those in the samples
assessed for cognition were in nursing homes. The average age of the
sample at both dates was about 75 years, of whom about 58% were
females.
Cognitive status of the 65+ population is determined through
responses to a series of tests for those who are self-respondents.
Responses to a set of questions to proxies and interviewer observations
are the basis of ascertainment for those who are not self-respondents.
Because poor cognitive functioning is one of the reasons people do not
respond for themselves, it is particularly important to include these
people in assessment of the national prevalence of cognitive loss.
Categorizing people as having good cognition, dementia, or CIND is
based on the concordance of HRS cognitive functioning scores and
diagnosis of dementia and CIND in a subset of HRS respondents who
had neuropsychological assessment in the Aging, Demographics, and
Memory Study (ADAMS) (Crimmins, Kim, Langa, & Weir, 2011;
Langa et al., 2005). Results from a detailed neuropsychological
diagnostic approach on a limited subsample of the HRS were used to
develop methods for classifying people as having dementia and CIND
in the larger population sample. The overall prevalence in the larger
population sample is the same as would be obtained if all sample
members had the neuropsychological diagnostic approach. The ap-
proach developed on this subsample of respondents for use in the
larger sample was used at all the HRS waves from 2000 through 2010.
In order to test the appropriateness of using the 10 year period to look
at change in cognitive life expectancy, we first examine the percent with
dementia and with CIND at each wave of the HRS from 2000 to 2010 to
see whether the change over time looks fairly consistent.
Self-respondents’ cognitive scores can range from 0 to 27 and are
based on tests of immediate recall of 10 words, delayed recall of the
same 10 words, 5 trials of Serial 7s, and Backward counting (score 0–
2). If a respondent does not complete all the tests, the missing
measures are imputed by HRS. A detailed description of the procedures
and the number of imputations over time is provided in Fisher, Hassan,
Faul, Rodgers, and Weir (2015). Respondents with scores from 12 to
27 are classified as having good cognitive functioning; 0–6 is dementia;
and 7–11 is CIND.
For individuals whose information is provided by proxies, the
classification is based on an direct assessment of memory (0 excellent,
1 very good, 2 good, 3 fair, 4 poor); an assessment of limitations in 5
instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) (managing money, taking
medication, preparing hot meals, using phones and doing groceries)
(0–5); and the interviewer assessment of difficulty completing the
interview because of cognitive limitation (score 0–2 indicating none,
some, prevents completion). These scores are summed and those with a
score of 0–2 are classified as cognitively healthy; 3–5 as CIND; and 6–
11 as having dementia. In 2000, 49.1% of those with dementia had
proxy respondents; this was true for 51.6% of those with dementia in
2010. Among those who answer for themselves, most have been in the
study for many waves and most of those in the 2010 sample were also
in the 2000 sample. In 2000, 86% of those who answer the cognitive
questions have been in the survey four or five times; in 2010, 77% have
been in the survey nine or ten times.
2.2. Methods
Healthy life expectancy measures combine indicators of morbidity
and mortality so that life expectancy can be divided into healthy and
unhealthy expected life (Saito, Robine, & Crimmins, 2014). Here, we
define healthy as life expectancy with good cognitive functioning and
unhealthy as life expectancy with dementia or CIND. Cognitively
healthy life expectancy reflects the average number of years at a
specified age a person can expect to live with good cognitive skills
given current mortality and prevalence of cognitive problems. We use
the Sullivan method for computing the length of healthy and unhealthy
life expectancy (Jagger et al., 2007; Saito et al., 2014).
Computation of cognitively healthy life expectancy and life expec-
tancy with dementia or CIND is based on dividing the lifetable years
lived in each age group into these three states using the prevalence of
the cognitive states at each age. Years lived with dementia or CIND are
summed at all ages after the specified age and divided by the number of
people alive at that age to obtain life expectancy with dementia or
CIND. Cognitively healthy life expectancy is determined by subtracting
these two states from total life expectancy. Standard errors for the
estimated values were computed using the approach provided by
Jagger et al. (2007).
3. Results
3.1. Trends in prevalence of good cognitive functioning, dementia
and CIND
We begin with an examination of cognitive status over six points in
time from 2000 to 2010 to see whether there is a somewhat consistent
trend over the period before we use the endpoints in our analysis of 10
year change in cognitive life expectancy. While the trend is not linear,
there does appear to be a drop over the ten years in the percent with
dementia and with CIND; we believe that this provides evidence that it
is worth looking further at the age-sex-specific change and combining
those with changes in life expectancy (Fig. 1).
When we examine the change over ten years by gender, we find a
significant increase in the prevalence of good cognitive functioning
among both men (4.45 percentage points) and women (3.41 percentage
points) in the 65+ population (Table 1); there was also a decrease of
2.60 percentage points in dementia prevalence among men and 1.99
percentage points among women. In addition, there was a decrease in
the prevalence of CIND among both men and women, but it is not
statistically significant.
All age groups within the 65+ group of both men and women
experienced an increase in the prevalence of good cognition. Among
women, the increase was significant in all but the youngest (65–69)

794
 and the oldest (85+); among men, the increase was only significant for
the 70–74. While there was a consistent decrease in dementia across
age-sex groups, it was only significant for the youngest men and women
75–79.
3.2. Life expectancy change
There was modest improvement in life expectancy over the 10
years. At age 65, life expectancy for men increased by 1.6 years and for
women by 1.2 years (Table 2). At age 85, life expectancy for both men
and women increased by 0.3 years.
3.3. Cognitively healthy life expectancy change
There was a significant increase in the length of cognitively healthy
life expectancy at age 65 for both men and women. The increase in
expected years with good cognition was 1.8 years for men and 1.6 years
for women; the increase in cognitively healthy life expectancy exceeds
that in total life expectancy. At age 85, both men and women also had
increased cognitively intact life expectancy of 0.3 years for men and 0.5
years for women. The change is significant for women but for men
there is some overlap in the estimated confidence intervals at the two
dates. For women at age 85, the increase in life expectancy with good
cognition was greater than the increase in total life expectancy, and for
men at age 85 these increases were equal.
3.4. Life expectancy with dementia and CIND change
Expected years of life expectancy with dementia at age 65 were
reduced by 0.3 for women and 0.4 for men, only the decrease among
females is significant. This is the same reduction as at age 85 indicating

 that the reduction was really concentrated at the oldest ages. There was
no significant change in the estimated life expectancy with CIND
between 2000 and 2010 for either men or women.
3.5. Change in proportion of life with and without cognitive problems
More of both men and women's expected life (4 percentage points
more) after age 65 is cognitively healthy; and less is spent with
dementia (a decrease of 3.3 percentage points for men and 2.3
percentage points for women) (Table 3). There is also an increase in
the proportion of life with good cognitive functioning after age 85 (3.2
percentage points for men and 5.9 percentage points for women). The
decline in the proportion of life with dementia after age 85 is quite
marked: 6.6 percentage points for men and 6.0 percentage points for
women.
3.6. Differences between men and women
While our interest in this paper is primarily change over time, our
estimates of dementia and CIND for men and women provide national
estimates for the population of the United States on sex differences in
both the prevalence and life expectancy with dementia, CIND, and good
cognitive functioning. In 2010, across all ages, men and women 65 and
over have the same proportion with good cognition (71.73% for men
and 70.23% for women); the percentage with dementia is higher for
women (10.80% versus 7.72%). At each age group less than 85, the
prevalence of dementia is similar for men and women; only above age
85 do women have higher levels of dementia. This higher prevalence of
dementia and longer life expectancy above age 85 lead to an extra year
of expected life with dementia for women (2.2 versus 1.2 for men).
4. Discussion
We report an increase in cognitively healthy life expectancy and a
decrease in life expectancy with dementia. If we define the compression
of morbidity as an increase in the proportion of life with good
cognition, there is a suggestion of a compression of cognitive morbidity
at the older ages in the United States from 2000 to 2010. This is an
important indicator of healthspan improvement. The increase in
cognitively healthy life expectancy and the reduction in dementia
may reflect influences from earlier life as well as current health
conditions. Early life is thought to have a particularly strong influence
on cognitive functioning (Katsnelson, 2015); and improvements in
health, nutrition and education of cohorts in early life may contribute
to the reduction of dementia and better cognitive functioning in later
life (Crimmins & Saito, 2001; Matthews, Jagger, Miller, Brayne, &
CFAS, 2009). However, recent research from Europe has implicated
cognitive activity in midlife, as evidenced in complex occupations, and
late life social engagement as additional protectors of cognitive
functioning
(Marioni,
Valenzuela,
Van
den
Hout,
Brayne,
&
Matthews, 2012, 2014). In addition, recent changes in hypertension
and cholesterol control in the older population may play a role in
reducing dementia.
The data from this study provide the first national estimates of life
expectancy with dementia because the study was based on data from a
large national sample of self-respondents tested for cognitive ability,
reports from proxies for those who could not be tested, and a smaller
subsample with detailed neuropsychological testing for developing
diagnostic criteria. While the sample has many strengths we should
mention one limitation. In a longitudinal cohort study where people are
interviewed every two years, respondents have been more exposed to
the cognitive questions in later years. It is possible that with more
practice, they become better at answering the questions.
Changes in healthy life expectancy provide a good summary of how
the average expected life cycle might change. Our data show a
reduction in the time spent with dementia that should result in a
reduction in the number of years when care and support is needed for
an average individual. However, the projected future increase in the
national burden of dementia is related to increases in the number of
people in the older age groups, which will only partially be offset by the
improvement of the average period spent with dementia.
