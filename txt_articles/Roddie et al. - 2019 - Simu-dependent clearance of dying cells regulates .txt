Abstract
Macrophages encounter and clear apoptotic cells during normal development and homeo-
stasis, including at numerous sites of pathology. Clearance of apoptotic cells has been
intensively studied, but the effects of macrophage–apoptotic cell interactions on macro-
phage behaviour are poorly understood. Using Drosophila embryos, we have exploited the
ease of manipulating cell death and apoptotic cell clearance in this model to identify that the
loss of the apoptotic cell clearance receptor Six-microns-under (Simu) leads to perturbation
of macrophage migration and inflammatory responses via pathological levels of apoptotic
cells. Removal of apoptosis ameliorates these phenotypes, while acute induction of apopto-
sis phenocopies these defects and reveals that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is not neces-
sary for their anti-inflammatory action. Furthermore, Simu is necessary for clearance of
necrotic debris and retention of macrophages at wounds. Thus, Simu is a general detector
of damaged self and represents a novel molecular player regulating macrophages during
resolution of inflammation.
Introduction
During development and throughout life, cells are eliminated by programmed cell death and
rapidly cleared by phagocytes such as macrophages and glia. Failures in apoptotic cell clear-
ance (efferocytosis) are thought to contribute to disease progression in multiple chronic
inflammatory conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) [1] and auto-
immune dysfunction [2], while effective removal of apoptotic cells helps drive resolution of
inflammation [3]. Given that macrophage interactions with apoptotic cells can be found in
multiple human pathologies, we wished to understand how such interactions affect macro-
phage behaviour at a cellular level. Therefore, to study the effects of developmental and patho-
logical levels of apoptosis on macrophages, we used Drosophila embryos, exploiting the ease of
manipulating cell death and apoptotic cell clearance during in vivo imaging in this model.

 Drosophila embryos contain a population of highly motile, macrophage-like cells (plasma-
tocytes, one of the three hemocyte cell types) that disperse to cover the entire embryo during
development, removing apoptotic cells and secreting extracellular matrix as they migrate [4].
In addition to their functional similarities with vertebrate white blood cells, fly blood cells
share genetic specification via the action of GATA and Runx family members [5]. Dispersal of
embryonic macrophages is controlled through expression of platelet-derived growth factor/
vascular endothelial growth factor (PDGF/VEGF) related ligands (Pvfs) along their routes [6–
8], coupled with physical constraints [9]. Cell–cell repulsion [10] and down-regulation of Pvfs
[8] contribute to the timing and stereotyped nature of later migratory events—lateral migra-
tion of macrophages from the ventral midline to the edges of the developing ventral nerve
cord (VNC).
Drosophila macrophages prioritise their activites in the developing embryo, with apoptotic
cell clearance taking precedence over their dispersal [11]. Surprisingly, prior exposure to apo-
ptotic cells seems required for normal responses to injury and infection [12]. Inflammatory
responses to sterile injuries strongly resemble those observed in vertebrates with a Duox (also
known as Cy) dependent burst in hydrogen peroxide essential for normal recruitment to sites
of damage [13,14] and a genetic requirement for specific Src family kinases within innate
immune cells [15,16].
During embryonic development, Drosophila macrophages work in concert with the glia of
the central nervous system (CNS) to remove apoptotic cells [17]. Both phagocytes use a variety
of receptors to recognise and engulf apoptotic cells [18], one of which is Six-microns-under
(Simu), also known as Nimrod C4. Simu is a member of the Nimrod family of cell surface
receptors with homology to members of the cell death abnormality gene 1 (CED-1) family of
receptors, e.g., CED-1 (Caenorhabditis elegans) [19], Draper (Drosophila melanogaster) [20],
Jedi-1, and multiple epithelial growth factor-like domains 10 (MEGF10, mouse) [21]. Simu
binds phosphatidylserine (PS) using its elastin microfibril interface-located protein (EMILIN)
like and NIM1 and NIM2 domains at the N-terminus [22], and its absence from macrophages
and glia leads to a failure in removing developmentally programmed apoptosis [23]. In some
contexts, Simu may operate upstream of Draper [23], though direct physical interaction has
not been demonstrated.
Here, we used simu mutant fly embryos to challenge macrophages with pathological levels
of apoptotic cell death to address how this affected their subsequent behaviour. We show that
apoptotic cell death contributes to developmental dispersal of macrophages and that excessive
amounts of apoptosis also induce defects in dispersal and migration. Chronic levels of
uncleared apoptotic cells and acute induction of apoptotic cell death impair wound responses
in vivo, importantly, without a requirement for phagocytosis of these dying cells. Finally, in
our new paradigm, we demonstrate a novel role for Simu in retention of macrophages at sites
of necrotic wounds and reveal that Simu facilitates clearance of nonapoptotic cells at such sites
of injury. Therefore, the role of Simu is not limited to clearance of apopotic cells but regulates
responses to damaged self in general.
Results
Apoptotic cells regulate developmental dispersal of macrophages
To understand the role of developmentally programmed apoptosis in dispersal of macro-
phages, Df(3L)H99 mutant embryos, which lack all apoptosis owing to deletion of the proa-
poptotic genes hid, reaper, and grim [24], were examined. As per previous reports [6,25],
macrophage dispersal was grossly normal in the absence of apoptosis (Fig 1a and 1b). How-
ever, detailed analysis at stage 13 of development revealed that more macrophages were

 present in lateral positions in embryos that lacked apoptosis compared to controls (Fig 1c and
1d). By stage 15, macrophage localisation on the VNC was similar in controls and embryos
lacking apoptosis (Fig 1e and 1f). Macrophage dispersal and VNC development are interde-
pendent [9], but in this instance, we saw no obvious VNC defects in the absence of apoptotic
cell death [26], making this dispersal phenotype unlikely to be a consequence of morphoge-
netic defects (Fig 1e and 1f). Consistent with this, live imaging of GFP-labelled macrophages at
stage 13 revealed that significantly greater numbers of macrophages left the ventral midline
and migrated laterally in the absence of apoptosis (Fig 1g). Furthermore, this precocious
migration was reflected in an enhancement in macrophage speeds in the absence of apoptosis
at stage 13, while speeds were similar to controls at stage 15 (Fig 1h).
By stage 15 of development, the majority of apoptosis occurs within the CNS [26], and the
formation of septate junctions by surface glia prevents macrophages from accessing these
dying cells [27]. Therefore, we predicted that macrophages at stage 15 would have fewer apo-
ptotic cell phagosomes in comparison to stage 13. To test this, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phos-
phate (PI3P) sensor was expressed in macrophages (2xFYVE-GFP) [28] to mark nascent
phagosomes [29] (Fig 1i). Consistent with sequestration of apoptosis within the CNS, there
were significantly fewer nascent phagosomes visible within macrophages at stage 15 compared
to stage 13 (Fig 1j, 1l and 1n), and such phagosomes were absent in apoptosis-null embryos
(Fig 1k, 1m and 1n). Therefore, it is only once macrophages become less exposed to apoptotic
cell death that they become more motile, suggesting that interactions with apoptotic cells
restrict macrophages from migrating laterally. Taken together, these data suggest that interac-
tions between developmentally programmed apoptotic cell death and macrophages can delay
lateral migration and contribute to the regulation of macrophage dispersal in Drosophila
embryos.
Pathological levels of apoptosis are associated with developmental defects
in macrophage dispersal
Having identified a novel role for apoptotic cell death in regulating dispersal of Drosophila
embryonic macrophages, we wished to investigate the consequences of pathological levels of
apoptosis on macrophage behaviour in vivo. Embryonic macrophages migrate along the ven-
tral midline in a constrained channel [9], in close contact with the epithelium and developing
CNS (Fig 2a and 2b). Later in development the environment becomes less constricted and
macrophages disperse over the ventral side of the embryo, albeit still sandwiched between the
epithelium and CNS (Fig 2c and 2d). Thus, macrophages migrate in very close contact with
the other main phagocyte population in the developing embryo (the glia of the VNC).
We predicted that removing the apoptotic cell clearance receptor Simu from macrophages
and glia would lead to an overstimulation of macrophages with apoptotic cells, owing to a
reduction in apoptotic cell clearance by these neighbouring cell populations. To confirm this
prediction, apoptotic cell death was visualised by staining embryos using an antibody to
cleaved death caspase 1 (cDCP-1), an effector caspase, itself cleaved during apoptosis [30].
Consistent with the role of Simu in apoptotic cell clearance, the absence of simu led to large
numbers of apoptotic cells remaining unengulfed at stage 15 in the space between the epithe-
lium and developing VNC, in contrast to controls in which very few uncleared apoptotic cells
persisted (Fig 2e and 2f). Significantly, simu mutants exhibited a large increase in the number
(i), and 10 μm (j–m). All data used to plot graphs may be found in Supporting information file S1 Data. CNS, central

 of untouched apoptotic cells in this region of the developing embryo (Fig 2g), with only a
small increase in the phagocytic index of macrophages (Fig 2h). Untouched apoptotic cell
punctae were used as a more conservative estimate of uncleared apoptotic cells, since macro-
phages were so overwhelmed that it was difficult to discern accurately whether phagocytosis
had taken place from images of immunostained embryos. Therefore, in line with previous data
[23], we could demonstrate a role for simu in apoptotic cell clearance, with the absence of simu
function leading to pathological levels of apoptosis surrounding macrophages on the ventral
side of the developing Drosophila embryo.
After establishing that loss of simu function leads to pathological levels of apoptosis in vivo,
we sought to test the effect this exerted on macrophage behaviour. Migration of macrophages
over the embryo is critical for embryonic development, since removal of dying cells and secre-
tion of matrix are important aspects of morphogenesis [31,32]. Drosophila macrophages clear
apoptotic cells as they disperse throughout the embryo, contemporaneously with induction of
apoptosis [33]. To assess developmental dispersal we scored macrophage progression along
the midline in control and simu mutant embryos, observing no obvious defects at stage 13 (Fig
3a–3c), nor was there a difference in the total numbers of macrophages in these embryos (Fig
3d), nor a delay in development (S1a Fig). However, quantification of numbers of macro-
phages on the ventral midline at stage 12 revealed defects in macrophage dispersal in simu
mutants (Fig 3e–3g; S1 Movie). Live imaging of macrophages from stage 12 onward showed
this dispersal defect persisted through development (Fig 3g and S1d Fig) and was associated
with a reduction in migration speed (S1b Fig). Macrophage apoptosis did not contribute to
this phenotype, with no macrophages adopting morphologies typical of cells undergoing apo-
ptosis in simu mutant embryos (16 movies analysed; S1 Movie). Imaging of whole embryos
revealed that migration to other regions appeared grossly normal in simu mutants (Fig 3a and
3b; S2 Movie).
This suggested that the presence of excessive numbers of apoptotic cells can perturb dis-
persal of macrophages, consistent with the sensitivity of these cells to developmentally pro-
grammed apoptosis (Fig 1c–1h). To image apoptosis and macrophage dispersal
simultaneously, we expressed a caspase-activated GFP variant (GC3ai) [34] ubiquitously
within embryos; GC3ai marks cells undergoing apoptosis that fragment and are engulfed by
macrophages (S1c Fig; S3 Movie). Even at stage 12, there is a significant increase in uncleared
apoptotic cells in ventral regions in simu mutants (Fig 3h–3j), and macrophages interact with
these clusters of dying cells, reducing their dispersal compared to controls (S3 Movie). Thus,
in the absence of apoptosis, macrophage dispersal is accelerated (Fig 1c–1h), whereas the pres-
ence of large amounts of apoptotic cell death is associated with a restriction in this process.
This indicates that apoptotic cells regulate macrophage migration and have the potential to
hinder normal development since dispersal is a prerequisite for normal morphogenesis
[31,32,35].
Pathological levels of apoptosis impair basal migration of macrophages
Given the impairment in developmental dispersal in the presence of excessive amounts of apo-
ptosis (Fig 3e–3g), we addressed whether macrophage migration was perturbed more generally
in simu mutants. We measured basal cell motility by imaging the wandering migration of
GFP-labelled macrophages at stage 15, finding that migration speeds were significantly
reduced in simu mutants compared to controls (Fig 4a–4c; S4 Movie). Despite the large num-
bers of uncleared apoptotic cells surrounding macrophages in simu mutants (Fig 2e–2g), there
was only a minor stimulation of phagocytosis in simu mutants (S2a–S2c Fig), consistent with
the role of Simu in apoptotic cell clearance [23]. We were unable to detect obvious or repeated

 attempts to phagocytose apoptotic cells, suggesting that the defects in migration may not sim-
ply be a consequence of frustrated phagocytic events. Furthermore, macrophages exhibited a
similar morphology to controls in simu mutants, exhibiting large, well-spread lamellipodia,
with the only morphological difference detected being decreased circularity (S2a, S2b, S2d and
S2e Fig). Therefore, the motility machinery of these embryonic macrophages remains intact,
consistent with relatively mild defects in their dispersal (Fig 3). As both basal migration and

matory migration to address whether other pathologically relevant macrophage behaviours

Pathological levels of apoptosis impair inflammatory migration to wounds
Macrophages undergo a rapid and highly directional inflammatory migration to laser-induced
wounds in Drosophila embryos [36]. Laser wounds induce calcium waves in the epithelium,
leading to production of hydrogen peroxide, which is essential for efficient recruitment of
macrophages to these sites of damage [14]. Imaging GFP-labelled macrophages in simu mutant

 embryos revealed a significant defect in recruitment of macrophages to wounds (Fig 4d–4f; S5
Movie). This effect was far greater than the small reduction in macrophage numbers present
on the midline ahead of wounding in simu mutants (Fig 3e–3g and S1d Fig), suggesting the
defect in inflammatory migration is not purely due to a reduction in cells available locally to
respond. Furthermore, the proportion of macrophages responding to wounds was also quanti-
fied, revealing that a significantly greater percentage of macrophages migrated to wounds in
controls compared to simu mutants (Fig 4g). Therefore, the ability to respond to wounds is
compromised in simu mutants at a cellular level, potentially due to the presence of large num-
bers of uncleared apoptotic cells in the embryonic milieu. Imaging calcium responses follow-
ing wounding using the cytoplasmic calcium sensor GCamP6M [37] indicated that this
reduction in inflammatory recruitment was not due to defects in the generation of wound cues
(S2f–S2i Fig).
Wound recruitment defects are specifically associated with loss of simu function, since plac-
ing the loss-of-function allele simu2 in trans to a deficiency that deletes simu also perturbed
inflammatory responses (S2j and S2k Fig). Furthermore, re-expression of wild-type simu in
macrophages ameliorated simu mutant defects (S2l and S2m Fig), in line with a role for simu
in both macrophage and glial-mediated apoptotic cell clearance [23].
Acute induction of apoptosis is sufficient to impair inflammatory
responses
Since pathological levels of apoptosis appeared to impair wound responses in simu mutants,
we wished to understand whether chronic or acute exposure to dying cells underlied this phe-
notype. Furthermore, carefully controlled introduction of apoptotic cell death would enable an
understanding of whether efferocytosis was necessary for apoptosis-induced impairment of
wound responses. To achieve this, the proapoptotic regulator hid was overexpressed through a
short heat-shock treatment of developing embryos that contained this gene under the control
of the hsp70 promoter (hs-hid) [38]. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by staining for acti-
vated caspases (Fig 5a). The length of heat-shock treatment was determined by imaging
embryos containing ubiquitous expression of a caspase activity reporter (apoliner) [39] and
the hs-hid transgene (S3a–S3d Fig; S6 Movie).
Stage 15 embryos were heat-shocked for 15 minutes and immediately mounted for wound-
ing. Wounding was performed 60 minutes after heat shock, a timepoint when caspase activity
could be seen in those cells destined to die by apoptosis but ahead of their delamination and
engulfment by macrophages (S3a–S3d Fig). The majority of cells that undergo apoptosis
appear to be superficial epithelial cells, and these typically remain in the epithelium over the
course of our 60-minute wounding experiments (60–120 minutes post heat shock), with a
wave of delamination eliminating them from the epithelium by 4.5 hours (±0.3 h standard
deviation, n = 9 movies; S6 Movie). Calibrating the assay in this fashion meant it was possible
to discern whether engulfment was a prerequisite for antagonism of inflammatory responses
by apoptotic cell death (Fig 5b). The lack of engulfment at this time point was confirmed via
quantification of apoptotic cell–containing vacuoles in macrophages, which are present in the
same numbers in macrophages that have been heat shocked in the presence or absence of hs-
hid (Fig 5c).
Imaging inflammatory responses of macrophages following induction of exogenous apo-
ptosis revealed a significant defect in macrophage recruitment to wounds at 60 minutes post
wounding compared to control embryos (Fig 5d and 5e; S7 Movie). Importantly, no macro-
phages were observed to undergo apoptosis in these assays (S7 Movie), suggesting these cells
are somewhat tolerant to hid expression, nor is there a reduction in numbers of macrophages

 ahead of wounding (S3e Fig). Wounding the same embryos in the absence of a heat shock
failed to reveal a defect in wound responses (S3f and S3g Fig), indicating impaired wound
responses were specific to the induction of exogenous apoptosis and could not have been
caused by differences in genetic background (e.g., insertion site of hs-hid). Taken together, this
suggests that acute induction of apoptosis can attenuate wound responses, phenocopying simu
mutant embryos in which macrophages are overwhelmed by uncleared apoptotic cells. Fur-
thermore, since we could not detect an increase in phagocytosis at the time of wounding (Fig
5c), this implies that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is not necessary for these phenotypes.
Removal of apoptosis from simu mutants restores normal migration and
improves macrophage responses to wounding
In order to confirm that excessive levels of uncleared apoptotic cells in simu mutants are
responsible for the reduction in cell motility and defects in inflammatory responses to dam-
aged tissue, the ability of cells to undergo developmentally programmed apoptosis was
removed from this mutant background using the Df(3L)H99 deficiency [24]. Comparing apo-
ptosis-null simu mutants (i.e., simu2;Df(3L)H99 double mutants) with simu mutants (simu2
single mutants) revealed a rescue of macrophage migration speed (Fig 6a and 6b), whereas
there was no difference in migration speed between macrophages in control and apoptosis-
null embryos (Fig 6a and 6b; S8 Movie). As expected no vacuoles were seen in macrophages
within apoptosis-null embryos, confirming absence of apoptosis and efferocytosis (Fig 6a).
Thus, migration defects in simu mutants are specifically due to apoptosis and not a subtle mor-
phogenetic or macrophage specification defect.
Next, we sought to test if removal of apoptosis from a simu mutant background might res-
cue inflammatory responses to sites of tissue damage. This represented a more difficult chal-
lenge since apoptosis-null embryos themselves exhibit a wound response defect [12], albeit
presenting a less severe phenotype than simu mutants themselves (Fig 6c and 6d). Quantifying
the wound response at 60 minutes post wounding showed no difference between simu and
apoptosis-null simu mutant embryos (Fig 6c and 6d). However, the percentage of macrophages
responding to wounds showed a substantial rescue of this initial response to wounds in apo-
ptosis-null simu mutant embryos compared to simu mutants (Fig 6e; S9 Movie). This rescue of
macrophage responses also highlights the fact that wound signals remain intact in simu
mutants (as per S2f–S2i Fig). Thus, initial inflammatory responses to injury are significantly
rescued in simu mutants in the absence of apoptosis, suggesting that simu is unlikely to play a
critical role in the detection or migration of macrophages to wounds. Instead, these data sug-
gest that excessive apoptosis subverts normal macrophage responses to wounds via a distinct
mechanism.
Simultaneously imaging macrophage wound responses and apoptotic cell death (via
GC3ai) showed that, as shown previously, control responses were very robust and few apopto-
tic cells were visible (Fig 7a; S10 Movie). In contrast, a varying amount of uncleared apopototic
cells were visible in simu mutants, with localisation also varying significantly (Fig 7a–7c and
S4a and S4b Fig). Clear associations between macrophages that fail to respond to wounds and
uncleared apoptotic cells could be seen (Fig 7b and 7c; S11 Movie), suggesting that uncleared
apoptotic cells can distract macrophages from their normal migration to wounds. Indeed, the
majority of nonresponding macrophages in simu mutants interact with uncleared apoptotic
cells (Fig 7d and 7e). Consistently, many macrophages undergoing inflammatory migration to
wounds in simu mutants do so with comparable speeds and directionalities to wild-type cells
(S4c–S4g Fig). This suggests that these cells can chemotax efficiently but that some are sub-
verted from their normal behaviours by pathological levels of apoptosis. Thus, while some

 macrophages fail to respond at all in simu mutants, others take a more circuitous route via
uncleared apopotic cells to reach wounds.
Simu mediates phagocytosis of debris at wounds and is required to retain
macrophages at sites of tissue injury
An abnormal number of macrophages were present at wounds 60 minutes after wounding in
simu mutants devoid of apoptosis despite a normal initial migratory response to wounds. Why
then is there a defect in wound responses at later timepoints? Vertebrate innate immune cells
are removed from sites of inflammation by either apoptosis [3,40] or reverse migration [41–
44], but there is no evidence to suggest that Drosophila macrophages die at wounds. Conse-
quently, we investigated whether precocious exit from sites of damage explained the incom-
plete rescue of wound responses in simu mutants in the absence of apoptosis. Macrophages
rarely left control wounds in the 60-minute post wounding; by contrast, significantly more
macrophages failed to remain at wounds in both simu and apoptosis-null simu mutant
embryos compared to controls (Fig 8a and 8b; S12 Movie). Unlike defects in initial migratory
responses to wounding (Fig 6e), this phenotype was maintained in the absence of apoptosis
(Fig 8b), suggesting that uncleared apoptotic cells were not drawing macrophages away from
wounds but rather simu regulates retention of macrophages at wounds. Macrophage-specific
re-expression of simu rescued the percentage of macrophages migrating to wounds and also
decreased exit from wounds in simu mutants (Fig 8c and 8c’). This indicates that simu func-
tions autonomously within macrophages and is necessary and sufficient to maintain these cells
at sites of tissue damage. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a gene control-
ling retention of macrophages at wounds in Drosophila embryos.
Surprisingly, loss of simu does not affect survival and hatching of wounded embryos (S5a
and S5b Fig) or prevent activation of signalling pathways associated with inflammation (e.g.,
c-Jun N-terminal kinase [JNK] signalling [45]; S5c and S5d Fig). However, the reduction in
recruitment and early exit of macrophages from wounds results in a more rapid termination
of the macrophage inflammatory response (S5e Fig), which is surprisingly associated with
enhanced rates of wound closure (S5f Fig). Therefore, it is possible that recruitment of innate
immune cells can hamper repair processes within Drosophila embryos.
To understand how Simu mediates retention of macrophages at sites of injury, we investi-
gated the wound environment in more detail: laser ablation results in large amounts of
necrotic death at wounds, as revealed by instantaneous entry of propidium iodide (PI) into
ruptured cells at these sites of damage (Fig 9a; S6a–S6c Fig). This loss of membrane integrity
leads to externalisation of PS (Fig 9b; S6d Fig), a known ligand of Simu [22]. PS staining accu-
mulates at sites of damage, particularly at the wound margin, and indicates the persistence of
large amounts of debris, even at 60 minutes post wounding (Fig 9b, S6d Fig and S13 Movie).
We hypothesised that macrophages are retained at wounds through either inhibition of cell
migration signals downstream of Simu or via physical interactions between PS and Simu at
these sites of damage. Consistent with interaction of Simu and PS-positive necrotic debris at
wounds, macrophages phagocytosed large amounts of debris at these sites in apoptosis-null
embryos but not in those embryos that lacked both simu function and apoptotic cell death or
when simu was removed specifically from macrophages via RNA interference (RNAi) (Fig 9c
and 9d). Thus, these data reveal another novel function for Simu in that it is required in mac-
rophages for phagocytosis of nonapoptotic debris at wounds, suggesting a more general role in
clearance of damaged cells in vivo rather than acting specifically in efferocytosis.
Finally, we hypothesised that Simu–PS interactions mediate engulfment of necrotic cells
and retention of macrophages at wounds. Expression of full-length simu but not a version of

 simu lacking the domains required to bind PS (EMI-NIM2) [22] was sufficient to stimulate
binding and engulfment of necrotic S2 cells by larval macrophages in vitro (Fig 9e–9g). Simi-
larly, macrophage-specific expression of simuΔEMI-NIM2-GFP failed to prevent early exit of
macrophages from wounds in simu mutants (Fig 9h). These data therefore suggest that Simu–
PS interactions directly mediate binding and engulfment of necrotic cells and contribute to
retention of macrophages at sites of injury.
Discussion
Here, we show that developmentally programmed apoptosis contributes to dispersal of macro-
phages in fly embryos, while excessive amounts of apoptosis disrupts macrophage dispersal,
migration, and inflammatory responses to wounds (see schematic diagram in Fig 9i). Acute
induction of apoptosis phenocopied defects in inflammatory responses, suggesting that apo-
ptotic cells drive these changes in macrophage behaviour and can do so independently of
phagocytosis. Importantly, removal of apoptosis from a simu mutant background rescued
migration and the initial inflammatory recruitment to wounds. These investigations reveal a
novel role for Simu in retention of macrophages at wounds, which depends on the PS-binding
regions of Simu, and suggests that this receptor functions more generally to facilitate clearance
of both apoptotic and necrotic cells.
We found that macrophage dispersal was impaired in the absence of apoptosis with preco-
cious migration from the ventral midline leading to reduced numbers localised on the develop-
ing CNS. Macrophage specification and migratory ability appeared otherwise normal in the
absence of apoptosis since cells were able to migrate at normal speeds. Dying cells may there-
fore provide instructive cues to aid dispersal. Indeed, apoptotic cells are known to play a role
in recruitment of tissue-resident macrophages in other systems [46,47]. Apoptotic midline
cells [48] may act to retain macrophages on the midline in wild-type embryos, potentially
explaining why macrophages migrated prematurely from the midline in the absence of apopto-
sis. Alternatively, factors released by ‘undead’ cells (cells induced to die but in which execution
of apoptosis is blocked) may interfere with macrophage dispersal in the absence of apoptosis.
Indeed, ‘undead’ cells are known to release signalling molecules such as transforming growth
factor β (TGFβ) family proteins and H2O2 [49,50], known regulators of macrophage behavior
in many disease states that are conserved across different models [14,51]. In contrast, interac-
tions with uncleared apoptotic cells appear to slow migration, also leading to aberrant dis-
persal. Morphological defects are unlikely to contribute since simu mutants appear grossly
normal and are viable [23].

 We found that apoptotic cell death was necessary for impairment of migration and wound
responses in simu mutants, in which uncleared apoptotic cells surround macrophages. Fur-
thermore, we could reproduce wound recruitment defects by acute induction of apoptosis
with macrophages failing to migrate to wounds. Phagocytosis of dying cells was not required
for this effect; consequently, we favour a model whereby ‘find-me’ signals released from
uncleared apoptotic cells act to subvert normal macrophage responses. Find-me cues are sig-
nals released by dying cells to recruit phagocytes to facilitate clearance [52], though none have
been identified to date in Drosophila. Consistent with this hypothesis, live imaging of apoptosis
and macrophage migration during wound responses indicate that the majority of macrophages
failing to respond to wounds in simu mutants interact with clusters of uncleared apoptotic
cells. The release of find-me cues or other stress signals produced in response to uncleared
apoptotic cells may confuse chemotactic responses of macrophages by operating as competing
sources of chemoattractant or attenuating signalling events required for other responses, as
seen in signal priorisation by neutrophils during their inflammatory recruitment [53].
We found that, on average, macrophages migrated more slowly in simu mutants; however,
many cells can move at comparable speeds to their wild-type counterparts, suggesting that the
general migration machinery is not greatly perturbed. This slowed migration seems unlikely to
account for impaired wound responses in simu mutants since macrophages lacking β-integrin
move more slowly but still ultimately reach wounds in normal numbers [54]. In addition to
the large increase in uncleared apoptotic cells, there was also a small increase in the phagocytic
index of macrophages, although this only equated to approximately one extra puncta per cell.
Others have reported that vacuolation of innate immune cells is associated with defective
migration [55,56], while overloading macrophages with engulfed cargoes can lead to phagoso-
mal maturation defects [57]. Furthermore, other professional phagocytes such as Dictyostelium
amoebae and dendritic cells pause migration when internalising cargo, albeit through macro-
pinocytic mechanisms [58,59]. However, we did not observe obvious repeated failures of
phagocytic events by simu mutant macrophages, suggesting that attempts to phagocytose
uncleared apoptotic cells were not stalling migration. Macrophages in simu mutants are signif-
icantly less vacuolated than suppressor of cyclic AMP receptor/WASP-family verprolin
homologous protein (SCAR/WAVE) complex mutant Drosophila macrophages and lysosomal
storage mutant macrophages in zebrafish larvae [55,56]—whether subtle changes in the num-
bers of phagosomes seen in this study can account for such potent disruption of macrophage
behaviour seems unlikely from the point of view of evolution of a functional innate immune
system, but the threshold at which phagosomal maturation becomes pathological has yet to be
directly addressed. An alternative explanation would be promotion of an anti-inflammatory
state of programming of macrophages by apoptotic cell clearance [60]. Currently, there is no
strong evidence for such macrophage programming in Drosophila, though some progress has
been made by Ando and colleagues [61,62]. Nonetheless, clearance of apoptotic cells is associ-
ated with increased expression of phagocytic receptors in a number of phagocytic cell types,
including macrophages [12,63–65]. Drosophila embryonic macrophages also undergo remark-
able shifts in behaviour over the fly life cycle, controlled in part by lipid hormone signalling
[66,67]. However, the anti-inflammatory phenotype we observed on acute induction of apo-
ptosis would necessitate rapid reprogramming of macrophages, which seems unlikely for lipid
hormone signalling. This therefore points towards a more instantaneous mechanism, such as
the release of find-me cues.
Laser wounding of the epithelium led to accumulation of necrotic debris at sites of injury,
including an accumulation and persistence of a marker used by phagocytes to clear apoptotic
cells (PS). Simu binds PS via three N-terminal domains [22] and is necessary for normal
phagocytosis of necrotic debris at wounds. This work suggests that Simu is a receptor for both

 apoptotic and necrotic cells and should be reclassified as a more general scavenger receptor, as
for the Drosophila receptors Draper and Croquemort [63,68,69]. Removal of uncleared apo-
ptotic cells from a simu mutant background rescued migration and improved responses to
wounds. The early departure of macrophages from such wounds resembles reverse migration
of neutrophils [41,44] and exit of macrophages, which can leave sites of inflammation via lym-
phatic vessels in vertebrates [43,70]. This failure of retention contributes to the impaired mac-
rophage inflammatory responses seen in the absence of Simu and undermines the rescue of
wound responses seen in the absence of apoptosis (simu;Df(3L)H99 double mutants). The PS-
binding domain of Simu is required to maintain macrophages at wound sites, therefore Simu
may directly mediate retention of macrophages at wounds via binding to PS and/or other
ligands. Alternatively, Simu may act more indirectly, possibly instructing macrophages to
remain at wounds by facilitating signalling through other coreceptors. The fact that initial
responses to wounds were rescued in the absence of apoptosis implies that Simu is not inter-
preting chemotactic cues released from wounds, while precocious exit of macrophages from
wounds in the absence of both Simu and apoptotic cell death (simu2;Df(3L)H99 mutants) sug-
gests these phagocytes are not simply being distracted away by apoptotic cells.
In summary, we show that the presence of apoptotic cells significantly alters macrophage
behaviour in vivo and reveal new functions for the apoptotic cell receptor Simu. Our finding
that pathological levels of apoptosis impair multiple macrophage functions has significant
implications for a wide range of human conditions in which changes in apoptotic cell death
and efferocytosis occur and are accompanied by aberrant or subverted macrophage behaviour
that drives or exacerbates disease progression, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, neurodegenera-
tive disorders, and other chronic inflammatory conditions.
Materials and methods
Fly genetics and husbandry
Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were reared on standard cornmeal/agar/molasses media at
18 ˚C or 25 ˚C. Embryos were harvested from laying cages with apple juice agar plates left
overnight at 22 ˚C. Srp-GAL4 and/or crq-GAL4 were used to label embryonic macrophages
with GFP, red stinger and/or CD4-tdTomato, or to drive expression of other transgenes; srp-
3x-mCherry [71] was used to label macrophages in a GAL4-independent manner. hmlΔ-GAL4
[72] was used to drive expression of UAS transgenes in larval macrophages. The following
alleles, transgenes, and deficiencies were used in this study: srp-GAL4 [7], crq-GAL4 [36], da-
GAL4 [73], hmlΔ-GAL4 [72], srp-3x-mCherry [71], Ecad-mCherry [74], UAS-GFP, UAS-nls-
GFP, UAS-red stinger [75], UAS-CD4-tdTomato [76], UAS-2xFYVE-GFP [28], UAS-apoliner
[39], UAS-GCamP6M [37], UAS-GC3ai [34], UAS-simu [23], UAS-simuΔEMI-NIM2-GFP
[22], UAS-simu RNAi (TRiP line HMJ23355) [77], simu2 [23], Df(3L)H99 [24], Df(2L)BSC253
[78], CyO hs-hid [38]. Selection against the fluorescent balancers CTG, CyO dfd, TTG, or
TM6b dfd was used to discriminate homozygous mutant embryos for recessive lethal alleles
[79,80]. See S1 Table for a full list of genotypes used in this study and their sources.
Imaging and wounding of Drosophila embryos
Embryos were washed off apple juice agar plates, dechorionated in bleach, and then washed in
distilled water. Live and fixed embryos were mounted on slides in voltalef oil (VWR) or
DABCO (Sigma), respectively, as per Evans and colleagues, 2010 [9]. Immunostained embryos
were imaged on a Nikon A1 confocal system using a 40X objective lens (CFI Super Plan Fluor
ELWD 40x, NA 0.6), which was used for the migration movies in Fig 4. Aside from S2 Movie
(Zeiss Lightsheet system; see S1 Methods), all other timelapse imaging and wounding was

 performed on a Perkin Elmer UltraView Spinning Disk system using a 40X objective lens
(UplanSApo 40x oil, NA 1.3). Lower magnification images of embryos were taken using a
MZ205 FA fluorescent dissection microscope with a PLANAPO 2X objective lens (Leica) or a
20x objective (UplanSApo 20x, NA 0.8) on the Perkin Elmer UltraView Spinning Disk system.
Fixation and immunostaining of Drosophila embryos
Embryos from overnight plates were fixed and stained as per Evans and colleagues, 2010 [9].
Antibodies were diluted 1:1 in glycerol for storage at −20 ˚C and these glycerol stocks were
diluted as indicated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Oxoid) containing 1% BSA (Sigma)
and 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma). Rabbit anti-cDCP-1 (1:500; 9578S –Cell Signaling Technolo-
gies), 22C10 mouse anti-Futch, (supernatant used at 1:100), 8D12 mouse anti-Repo, (concen-
trate used at 1:500 –Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) were used as primary
antibodies. Rabbit anti-GFP (1:500; ab290 –Abcam) or mouse anti-GFP (1:100; ab1218 –
Abcam) were used to stain GFP-expressing macrophages for co-immunostaining with mouse
and rabbit primary antibodies, respectively. Fluorescently-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568, Alexa Fluor 488 –Thermo Fisher, or FITC–
Jackson Immunoresearch) were used to detect primary antibodies at 1:200.
Macrophage migration assays
Embryos with fluorescently labelled macrophages were mounted ventral-side up and left to
acclimatise on slides for 30 minutes before imaging for all migration assays. Macrophage
behaviour was analysed from stage 12 (developmental dispersal), stage 13 (lateral migration),
or stage 15 (wounding and wandering/random migration). Z-stacks correspond to the region
between the epithelium and CNS. Maximum projections of despeckled z-stacks were assem-
bled and tracked using the manual tracking plugin in Fiji [81,82]. For random migration anal-
ysis, only those macrophages lying between the edges of the VNC at the start of the movie
were tracked, with cells imaged every 2 minutes for 1 hour (with the exception of data in Fig 4,
which was collected every 1 minute for a 30-minute period). Individual cell speeds and direc-
tionalities were calculated using the Chemotaxis plugin (Ibidi) in Fiji.
For the wounding assay, prewound z-stacks were taken prior to wounding of stage 15
embryos on their epithelial surface using a nitrogen-pumped Micropoint ablation laser
(Andor), as per Evans et al., 2015 [16]. Z-stacks of wounded embryos were collected every 2
minutes for 1 hour (or every 20 minutes for 3 hours for S5e and S5f Fig). At the end of the
movie, an additional z-stack was taken incorporating a brightfield image with which to mea-
sure the wound size (60-minute movies). Movies were assembled as per wandering migration
movies. The number of macrophages at wounds was quantified from a 15 μm deep z-stack,
with the first z-slice used in this analysis corresponding to the one containing the most superfi-
cial macrophage adjacent to but not at the wound. Wound area was measured from the bright-
field (or Ecad-mCherry channel; S5e and S5f Fig). Macrophage responses to wounds were
calculated as follows: number of macrophages within or touching the wound area divided by
wound area in μm2. This was normalised according to control responses.
To calculate the initial inflammatory response to wounds, the percentage of responding
macrophages was calculated: this is the percentage of macrophages present at in the field of
view at 0 minutes post wounding that migrated to the wound; macrophages already present at
the wound site at this timepoint were not counted as responding nor included in the total
numbers present in the field of view. Macrophages that left the wound were not counted a sec-
ond time if they returned and were defined as responding if they moved towards and touched
the wound edge.

 To assess exit of macrophages from wound sites, the percentage of macrophages that left
the wound site was counted. This is the proportion of macrophages (either that were present at
the wound site at t = 0 minutes or that reached the wound at any point during the wound
movie) that left the wound during the course of a 60-minute timelapse movie; if any part of a
macrophage retained contact with the wound edge, it was not scored as having left.
Introduction of exogenous apoptosis via heat-shock
Hs-hid or control embryos from overnight plates were washed off into embryo baskets (70μm
cell strainers, Fisher) using distilled water. Baskets containing embryos to be heat-shocked
were placed into a large weighing boat containing 75ml of prewarmed distilled water in a cir-
culating water bath set to 39 ˚C for the indicated time. Non heat-shocked controls were incu-
bated in distilled water at room temperature. Following heat shock, embryos were
dechorionated and then stage 15 embryos selected and mounted for live imaging 30 minutes
before they were due to be wounded, such that they could acclimatise on slides. For instance, if
embryos were wounded at 60 minutes post heat shock, slides were set up to be ready for 30
minutes post heat shock. Embryos were then wounded and imaged as described above to visu-
alise macrophage behaviour or caspase activity via the apoliner reporter [39]. Alternatively,
embryos were fixed at various timepoints post heat shock to reveal caspase activity via cDCP-1
immunostaining.
Injection of propidium iodide and annexin V
PI and annexin V are well-characterised reagents used to detect membrane permeabilisation/
necrosis and exposure of PS/apoptosis, respectively [83,84]. Embryos were mounted ventral-
side up on double-sided sticky tape (Scotch), dehydrated for 7–10 minutes in an air-tight
box containing sachets of silica gel (Sigma), then covered in voltalef oil before microinjection.
Borosilicate glass needles (World Precision Instruments; capillaries were 1-mm and 0.75-mm
inner and outer diameter capillaries, respectively) for microinjection were made using a P1000
needle puller (Sutter). Embryos were microinjected anteriorly into the head region with 1 mg/
ml PI (Sigma) dissolved in PBS or into the vitelline space with undiluted Alexa Fluor
568-labelled Annexin V (Invitrogen). After injection, a coverslip (thickness 1, VWR) was
applied, supported by two coverslip bridges (thickness 1, VWR) placed on either side of the
embryos, and fixed in place with nail varnish. Embryos were then imaged immediately,
wounded, and then reimaged to detect membrane permeabilisation and/or externalisation of
PS. As a positive control for necrotic cell death, embryos were injected with PI, coverslips
attached, and then heated at 60 ˚C in a humidified box for 15 minutes.
Challenge of larval macrophages with necrotic cells
Drosophila S2 cells were grown in Schneider’s medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated FBS (Thermo Fisher) and 1X Pen/Strep (Thermo Fisher). S2 cells were labelled via
incubation for 30 minutes with 5 μM cell tracker red (Thermo Fisher). Cell tracker red-labelled
S2 cells were then washed off tissue culture flasks and numbers counted using a haemocyt-
ometer. Residual cell tracker was removed by centrifugation of resuspended cells at 1,350 rpm
for 5 minutes at 4 ˚C; cells were resuspended in fresh S2 media at a concentration of 4.5 x 105
cells per ml and heated in 0.5 ml aliquots at 65 ˚C for 10 minutes to induce necrosis (adapted
from Kimura and colleagues, 2014 [85]). Necrosis was confirmed by heat treating of non-
stained cells in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml PI (Biolegend). Necrotic cell suspensions were cooled
to room temperature in a water bath and then 75 μL of the necrotic cell suspension (3.4 x 104
cells; an estimated ratio of 5:1 necrotic cells per larval macrophage that is based upon average

 densities of cells dissected from w1118 larvae) was added per well to challenge adhered larval
macrophages. Macrophages were obtained by dissecting a single L3 wandering larvae of the
indicated genotype in 75 μL S2 media on ice, before transferring macrophage suspensions to a
well in a Porvair 96-well plate to adhere for 45 minutes ahead of challenge with necrotic cells.
Necrotic-larval macrophage cocultures were left for 1 hour to allow binding/engufment before
removal of media and fixation using 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes. Fixed cells were
imaged using a Nikon Ti Eclipse system with a CFI Plan Apochromat λ 20X (NA 0.75) objec-
tive lens. The proportion of GFP-labelled larval macrophages binding/engulfing necrotic, cell
tracker red-labelled S2 cells was then scored from blinded images and fields of view averaged
per well (5 fields of view per well, 1 larva per well).
Quantification of phagocytosis and failed apoptotic cell clearance
Anti-cDCP-1 and anti-GFP immunostained embryos were imaged on a Nikon A1 system
using the 40X objective lens with a spacing of 0.25 μm between z-slices. Channels were merged
to enable discrimination of cDCP-1 punctae within/outside macrophages. A portion of the z-
stack representing a 10 μm deep volume corresponding to the area occupied by macrophages
between the epithelium and VNC was used to count numbers of cDCP-1 punctae per macro-
phage to quantify phagocytic index. Only macrophages completely in view in the 10 μm sub-
stack were included in the analysis and these values were averaged to give an overall value per
embryo; at least 10 macrophages were analysed per embryo. Untouched apoptotic cells were
quantified by counting the number of red cDCP-1 punctae that are located within the 10 μm
substack, but that were not in contact with GFP-labelled macrophages. This method was
selected to enable comparison with the quantification of Kurant and colleagues, 2008 [23] and
also since it was technically challenging to discriminate whether cDCP-1 punctae in close con-
tact with macrophages were inside or outside of macrophages in simu mutants owing to the
extreme buildup of uncleared apoptotic cells in this background.
Number of vacuoles per macrophage (averaged per embryo) was used as an indirect read-
out of phagocytosis. Drosophila macrophages exclude cytoplasmic GFP from phagosomes and
these can be shown to correspond to apoptotic cells by their absence from macrophages in
apoptosis-null Df(3L)H99 embryos. Vacuoles were counted using z-stacks of GFP-labelled
macrophages taken from live imaging experiments. Vacuoles were assessed in the z-slice in
which each macrophage exhibited its maximal cross-sectional area. Therefore, this analysis
should not be considered as the absolute numbers of corpses per cell but a relative read-out
thereof.
Phagocytosis was also quantified from stills or movies of macrophages expressing either
2xFYVE-GFP or CD4-tdTomato. Z-stacks were taken every 15 seconds for 20 minutes. Phago-
cytic events were scored when new phagocytic events occurred via formation of phagocytic
cups (CD4-tdTomato) or the numbers of 2xFYVE-GFP punctae larger than 2 μm with an
obvious lumen present in macrophages, as a read-out of recently formed phagosomes. 2xFY-
VE-GFP punctae of this size are absent from macrophages in Df(3L)H99 mutants.
Analysis of developmental dispersal and macrophage numbers
Developmental dispersal of macrophages was analysed by scoring the presence of GFP-labelled
macrophages between the epithelium and VNC in each segment at stage 13/14 following fixa-
tion and immunostaining for GFP. Embryos with macrophages in all segments were scored as
exhibiting 100% progression along the midline; an embryo that lacked macrophages in seg-
ments 6–9 would have been scored as 66% progression.

 As a read-out of total numbers of macrophages per embryo, lateral views of embryos con-
taining red stinger-labelled macrophages were stitched together, thresholded and processed
using the watershed tool in Fiji. The analyse particles tool was then used to count cells. Lateral
views correspond to a depth of 50 μm from where the most superficial macrophages come into
focus. At other stages of development, numbers of GFP-labelled macrophages per field of view
between the epithelium and VNC were scored.
Image processing, quantification, and statistical analyses
Image processing was carried out in Fiji/ImageJ, with images despeckled before maximum
projections were assembled. Brightness and contrast enhancements were applied equally
across all data sets being compared with each other. A Python (Python Software Foundation)
script provided by the Whitworth Lab (University of Cambridge) was used to blind images
ahead of analysis. Figures were assembled in Photoshop (Adobe).
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad); see legends and text for details
of statistical tests used. N numbers refer to individual Drosophila embryos (unless otherwise
stated), taken from laying cages containing >50 adult flies; experiments were conducted across
at least three imaging sessions with control embryos mounted on the same slides each time.
Previous experimental data shows that >6 movies (wandering migration) and 15–20 wound
movies are sufficient to detect an effect size of 20% that of control values. Movies that lost
focus or wounds that leaked obscuring macrophages at wounds were excluded from analyses.
Immunostaining was performed on batches of pooled embryos collected across multiple days,
with controls stained in parallel using staining solutions made up as a master mix and split
between genotypes.

S6 Fig. Laser-induced injury results in presentation of phosphatidylserine and membrane
rupture with large amounts of nonapoptotic debris persisting at wound sites. (a–b) PBS (a)
or PI injected (b) stage 15 embryos with GFP-labelled macrophages (w;;crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP)
were imaged before and immediately after wounding, showing a dramatic accumulation of PI
staining at the wound site immediately after laser-mediated ablation. Timings refer to expo-
sure duration during image capture—a shorter exposure time (5 ms) reveals detail of nuclear
localisation of PI, suggestive of necrotic cell death (b”); zoomed panel (b”’) shows close up of
wound region in (b”). (c) As a positive control, embryos of the same genotype were heat
treated for 15 minutes at 60 ˚C, resulting in widespread entry of PI in to cells and leakage of
GFP from macrophages. (d–d’) Injection of texas red-labelled annexin V (as a marker for PS)
into the vitelline space of stage 15 embryos with GFP-labelled macrophages (w;;crq-GAL4,
UAS-GFP) reveals a rapid and sustained accumulation of annexin V at the wound edge and
within the wound, including on cells in the process of being engulfed by those macrophages
that have migrated to that site. Scale bars represent 20 μm (a–c) and 10 μm (d). GFP, green
fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, propidium iodide; PS, phosphatidyl-
serine; UAS, upstream activating sequence.

S1 Movie. Developmental dispersal of macrophages along the ventral midline in control
and simu mutant embryos. GFP-labelled macrophages migrating on the ventral midline from
late stage 12 onwards in a control (w;;crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP) and a simu mutant embryo (w;
simu2;crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP). Macrophage dispersal is similar to controls, but on average there

 S2 Movie. Developmental dispersal of macrophages in control and simu mutant embryos.
Lightsheet movies of laterally-orientated control (w;;crq-GAL4,UAS-red stinger, upper embryo)
and a simu mutant embryos (w;simu2;crq-GAL4,UAS-red stinger, lower embryo) containing
red stinger-labelled macrophages undergoing developmental dispersal from stage 12 onwards.
Macrophage dispersal is grossly similar to controls in simu mutants. Ant, anterior; post, poste-
rior; hm, head mesoderm; vnc, ventral nerve cord; as, amnioserosa; gb, germ band; vm, vitel-
line membrane (outlined in green); both embryos are in the same orientation; scale bar
represents 50 μm. UAS, upstream activating sequence.
(AVI)
S3 Movie. Developmental dispersal of macrophages in control and simu mutant embryos
in relation to apoptotic events. One hundred eighty-minute movies of mCherry-labelled
macrophages (purple) and Caspase-ON reporter-labelled apoptotic cells (GC3ai, green) in a
control (w;;da-GAL4,UAS-GC3ai/srp-3x-mCherry) and a simu mutant embryo (w;simu2;da-
GAL4,UAS-GC3ai/srp-3x-mCherry) from early stage 12 onwards. Ventral views show macro-
phages as they migrate down the midline; embryos orientated diagonally across the field of
view in order to image a greater proportion of the embryo. Note large numbers of GC3ai parti-
cles in simu mutant movie compared to the control and the slower migration speeds of macro-
phages in the simu mutant. Scale bars represent 20 μm. UAS, upstream activating sequence.
(AVI)
S4 Movie. Macrophages migrate at slower speeds in simu mutants compared to controls.
30-minute movies of GFP-labelled macrophages at stage 15 on the ventral midline showing
their random migration in control (w;;crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP, upper embryo) and simu mutant
embryos (w;simu2;crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP, lower embryo). Movies repeat with second movie
showing tracks of macrophage migration. Scale bar represents 20 μm. GFP, green fluorescent
protein; UAS, upstream activating sequence.
(AVI)
S5 Movie. Macrophage responses to wounds are perturbed in simu mutant embryos. Mov-
ies of the inflammatory migration of GFP-labelled macrophages to epithelial wounds in con-
trol (w;;crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP, embryo on left) and simu mutant embryos (w;simu2;crq-GAL4,
UAS-GFP, embryo on right) at stage 15 of development on the ventral midline. Embryos
wounded in the centre of the field of view. Scale bars represent 25 μm. GFP, green fluorescent
protein; UAS, upstream activating sequence.
(AVI)
S6 Movie. Induction of apoptosis visualised using the apoliner caspase reporter. Movies of
w;CyO hs-hid/+;da-GAL4,UAS-apoliner/+ embryos heat-shocked for 0 minutes (negative con-
trol), 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes; timelapse movies begin 1-hour post
heat shock. Caspase activity results in cleavage of apoliner, enabling its nls-GFP to translocate
to the nucleus, whereas CD8-RFP remains on membranes. Caspase activity increases rapidly
from 1-hour post heat shock, with the majority of caspase-positive cells remaining in an intact
epithelium beyond the period of time in which inflammatory responses are typically followed.
Movie shows green channel in first instance; second cycle shows merged image with GFP in
green and RFP in purple. Scale bars represent 50 μm. GFP, green fluorescent protein; RFP, red
fluorescent protein; UAS, upstream activating sequence.

 UAS-GFP/CyO) and an embryo in which exogenous apoptosis has been introduced through
hid expression (w;srp-GAL4,UAS-GFP/CyO hs-hid). Both embryos were heat-shocked for 15
minutes, with laser-wounding taking place 1-hour post heat-shock at a time-point when cas-
pase activity is dramatically increasing, but when engulfment of cells destined to die has yet to
take place. Fewer macrophages migrate to wounds in the presence of apoptotic cells, suggest-
ing that apoptosis, but not necessarily phagocytosis of dying cells, can dampen inflammatory
responses. Dotted lines show wound sites; scale bars represent 20 μm. GFP, green fluorescent
protein; UAS, upstream activating sequence.
(AVI)
S8 Movie. Rescue of wandering migration in simu mutants with no apoptosis. Hour-long
movies of GFP-labelled macrophages in control (w;;crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP), apoptosis-null Df
(3L)H99 mutant (w;;Df(3L)H99,crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP), simu mutant (w;simu2;crq-GAL4,
UAS-GFP) and apoptosis-null simu mutant embryos (w;simu2;Df(3L)H99,crq-GAL4,
UAS-GFP) at stage 15. Removal of apoptotic cell death rescues macrophage speeds in a simu
mutant background. Note the absence of vacuoles in Df(3L)H99 and simu2;Df(3L)H99
embryos due to the lack of apoptotic cell death. Scale bars represent 20μm. GFP, green fluores-
cent protein; UAS, upstream activating sequence.
(AVI)
S9 Movie. Rescued initial responses to wounds in the absence of apoptosis in simu
mutants. Hour-long movies of GFP-labelled macrophages in control (w;;crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP),
apoptosis-null Df(3L)H99 mutant (w;;Df(3L)H99,crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP), simu mutant (w;simu2;
crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP) and apoptosis-null simu mutant embryos (w;simu2;Df(3L)H99,crq-GAL4,
UAS-GFP) at stage 15 following wounding; initial image shows prewound image. Removal of
apoptotic cell death rescues the percentage of macrophages responding to wounds in a simu
mutant background. Note the absence of vacuoles in Df(3L)H99 and simu2;Df(3L)H99
embryos due to the lack of apoptotic cell death. Scale bars represent 20 μm. GFP, green fluores-
cent protein; UAS, upstream activating sequence.

S10 Movie. Macrophage responses to injury in the presence of wild-type levels of uncleared
apoptotic cell death. Ventral view of a stage 15 control embryo (w;;srp-3x-mCherry/da-GAL4,
UAS-GC3ai) wounded at the midline showing robust macrophage (mCherry, purple) migra-
tory responses to injury. Tracks of migration routes are overlaid; asterisk indicates position of
wound. Very few apoptotic cell fragments (GC3ai, green) are visible, though occasionally
interactions may be seen with GC3ai-labelled particles (boxed region); first half of movie
shows overall response, before showing zooms of the cells from the boxed region in the pre-
wound image. Scale bars represent 20 μm. UAS, upstream activating sequence.
(AVI)
S11 Movie. Nonresponding macrophages interact with caspase-positive cell fragments
impairing migration to wounds in simu mutants. Ventral view of a stage 15 simu mutant (w;
simu2;srp-3x-mCherry/da-GAL4,UAS-GC3ai) wounded at the midline showing a weak macro-
phage (mCherry, purple) migratory response to injury. Tracks of migration routes are overlaid;
asterisk indicates position of wound. The caspase reporter GC3ai (green) highlights numerous
uncleared apoptotic fragments within the embryo and interactions between these and macro-
phages are associated with failed migration to the wound site (e.g., boxed region). First half of
movie shows overall response, before showing zooms of the cells from the boxed region in the
prewound image. Scale bars represent 20 μm. UAS, upstream activating sequence.

 S12 Movie. Enhanced macrophage egress from wounds in the absence of simu. Movies of
GFP-labelled macrophages during wound responses to laser-induced epithelial wounds on the
ventral midline in a control embryo (w;;crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP; embryo on left) and simu mutant
that lacks apoptosis (w;simu2;Df(3L)H99,crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP; embryo on right). First repeat of
wound response shows GFP channel only; second repetition shows all tracks of those cells
present at 0 minutes post wounding superimposed over GFP channel; third repetition shows
tracks of macrophages that leave the wound (1 cell in control embryo, 5 cells in the simu2;Df
(3L)H99 embryo). Scale bar represents 20 μm. GFP, green fluorescent protein; UAS, upstream
activating sequence.
(AVI)
S13 Movie. Macrophages interact with annexin V-labelled debris at wounds. Movie show-
ing accumulation of annexin V to label exposed PS at wounds on the ventral surface during an
inflammatory response in a control embryo (w;;crq-GAL4,UAS-GFP). Initial run of timelapse
movie shows texas red-labelled annexin V alone, second repeat shows GFP-labelled macro-
phages (green) and annexin V (purple). Injection of fluorescent annexin V into the vitelline
space labels the wound edge, suggesting that PS decorates stressed or damaged cells at these
sites. Scale bar represents 20 μm. GFP, green fluorescent protein; PS, phosphatidylserine; UAS,
upstream activating sequence.
