IMPORTANCE Players of American football may be at increased risk of long-term neurological
conditions, particularly chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
OBJECTIVE To determine the neuropathological and clinical features of deceased football
players with CTE.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case series of 202 football players whose brains were
donated for research. Neuropathological evaluations and retrospective telephone clinical
assessments (including head trauma history) with informants were performed blinded.
Online questionnaires ascertained athletic and military history.
EXPOSURES Participation in American football at any level of play.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Neuropathological diagnoses of neurodegenerative
diseases, including CTE, based on defined diagnostic criteria; CTE neuropathological severity
(stages I to IV or dichotomized into mild [stages I and II] and severe [stages III and IV]);
informant-reported athletic history and, for players who died in 2014 or later, clinical
presentation, including behavior, mood, and cognitive symptoms and dementia.
RESULTS Among 202 deceased former football players (median age at death, 66 years
[interquartile range, 47-76 years]), CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 players
(87%; median age at death, 67 years [interquartile range, 52-77 years]; mean years of football
participation, 15.1 [SD, 5.2]), including 0 of 2 pre–high school, 3 of 14 high school (21%), 48 of
53 college (91%), 9 of 14 semiprofessional (64%), 7 of 8 Canadian Football League (88%),
and 110 of 111 National Football League (99%) players. Neuropathological severity of CTE was
distributed across the highest level of play, with all 3 former high school players having mild
pathology and the majority of former college (27 [56%]), semiprofessional (5 [56%]), and
professional (101 [86%]) players having severe pathology. Among 27 participants with mild
CTE pathology, 26 (96%) had behavioral or mood symptoms or both, 23 (85%) had cognitive
symptoms, and 9 (33%) had signs of dementia. Among 84 participants with severe CTE
pathology, 75 (89%) had behavioral or mood symptoms or both, 80 (95%) had cognitive
symptoms, and 71 (85%) had signs of dementia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a convenience sample of deceased football players who
donated their brains for research, a high proportion had neuropathological evidence of CTE,
suggesting that CTE may be related to prior participation in football.

hronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progres-
sive neurodegeneration associated with repetitive
head trauma.1-8 In 2013, based on a report of the
clinical and pathological features of 68 men with CTE
(including 36 football players from the current study), crite-
ria for neuropathological diagnosis of CTE and a staging
scheme of pathological severity were proposed.6 Two clini-
cal presentations of CTE were described; in one, the initial
features developed at a younger age and involved behav-
ioral disturbance, mood disturbance, or both; in the other,
the initial presentation developed at an older age and
involved cognitive impairment.9 In 2014, a methodologi-
cally rigorous approach to assessing clinicopathological
correlation in CTE was developed using comprehensive
structured and semistructured informant interviews and
online surveys conducted by a team of behavioral neurolo-
gists and neuropsychologists.10 In 2015, the neuropatho-
logical criteria for diagnosis of CTE were refined by a panel
of expert neuropathologists organized by the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the
National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineer-
ing (NINDS-NIBIB).8
Using the NINDS-NIBIB criteria to diagnose CTE and the
improved methods for clinicopathological correlation, the
purpose of this study was to determine the neuropathologi-
cal and clinical features of a case series of deceased football
players neuropathologically diagnosed as having CTE whose
brains were donated for research.
Methods
Study Recruitment
In 2008, as a collaboration among the VA Boston Healthcare
System, Bedford VA, Boston University (BU) School of Medi-
cine, and Sports Legacy Institute (now the Concussion
Legacy Foundation [CLF]), a brain bank was created to bet-
ter understand the long-term effects of repetitive head
trauma experienced through contact sport participation and
military-related exposure. The purpose of the brain bank
was to comprehensively examine the neuropathology and
clinical presentation of brain donors considered at risk of
development of CTE. The institutional review board at Bos-
ton University Medical Campus approved all research activi-
ties. The next of kin or legally authorized representative of
each brain donor provided written informed consent. No
stipend for participation was provided. Inclusion criteria
were based entirely on exposure to repetitive head trauma
(eg, contact sports, military service, or domestic violence),
regardless of whether symptoms manifested during life.
Playing American football was sufficient for inclusion.
Because of limited resources, more strict inclusion criteria
were implemented in 2014 and required that football play-
ers who died after age 35 years have at least 2 years of
college-level play. Donors were excluded if postmortem
interval exceeded 72 hours or if fixed tissue fragments rep-
resenting less than half the total brain volume were received
(eFigure in the Supplement).
Clinical data were collected into a Federal Interagency
Traumatic Brain Injury Research–compliant database.
Since tracking began in 2014, for 98 (81%) brain donations
to the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank, the next of kin approached
the brain bank near the time of death. The remaining brain
donors were referred by medical examiners (11 [9%]),
recruited by a CLF representative (7 [6%]), or participated
in the Brain Donation Registry during life (5 [4%]) (eFigure
in the Supplement).
Clinical Evaluation
Retrospective clinical evaluations were performed using
online surveys and structured and semistructured post-
mortem telephone interviews between researchers and
informants. Researchers conducting these evaluations
were blinded to the neuropathological analysis, and infor-
mants were interviewed before receiving the results of the
neuropathological examination. A behavioral neurologist,
neuroscientist, or neuropsychologist (J.M., D.H.D., T.M.S.,
M.L.A., or R.A.S.) obtained a detailed history, including a
timeline of cognitive, behavioral, mood, and motor sympto-
mology. Additionally, other neuropsychiatric symptoms,
exposures and symptoms consistent with posttraumatic
stress disorder, features of a substance use disorder, neuro-
degenerative diagnoses made in life (Alzheimer disease
[AD], frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, demen-
tia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson disease, CTE, or dementia
of unknown etiology), headaches that impaired function,
symptoms and diagnoses made in life of sleep disorders,
and causes of death were assessed. Clinicians qualitatively
summarized the participants’clinical presentation (eg, pres-
ence and course of symptoms, functional independence)
into a narrative and presented the case to a multidisci-
plinary consensus team of clinicians, during which it was
determined whether the participant met criteria for demen-
tia. To resolve discrepancies in methods that evolved over
time, only clinical variables ascertained after January 2014
using a standardized informant report were included
because of the larger subset of participants recruited during
this time frame (n = 125).
Prior to January 2014, demographics, educational
attainment, athletic history (type of sports played, level,
Key Points
Question What are the neuropathological and clinical features
of a case series of deceased players of American football
neuropathologically diagnosed as having chronic traumatic
encephalopathy (CTE)?
Findings In a convenience sample of 202 deceased players
of American football from a brain donation program, CTE was
neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 players across all levels
of play (87%), including 110 of 111 former National Football League
players (99%).
Meaning In a convenience sample of deceased players
of American football, a high proportion showed pathological
evidence of CTE, suggesting that CTE may be related to prior
participation in football.

 position, age at first exposure, and duration), military his-
tory (branch, location of service, and duration of combat
exposure), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) history (includ-
ing number of concussions) were queried during the tele-
phone interview. Beginning in January 2014, demographics,
educational attainment, and athletic and military history
were queried using an online questionnaire. Informant-
reported race was collected as part of demographic informa-
tion so that neuropathological differences across race could
be assessed. To be considered a National Football League
(NFL) athlete, a participant must have played in at least
1 regular-season NFL game. Professional position and years
of play were verified using available online databases (http:
//www.pro-football-reference.com, http://databasefootball
.com, http://www.justsportsstats.com). History of TBI was
queried using informant versions of the Ohio State University
TBI Identification Method Short Form11 and 2 questionnaires
adapted from published studies that address military-related
head injuries and concussions.12,13 With the addition of these
questionnaires, informants were read a formal definition of
concussion prior to being asked about concussion history,
which was not the case prior to January 2014.
Neuropathological Evaluation
Pathological processing and evaluation were conducted
using previously published methods.14,15 Brain volume
and macroscopic features were recorded during initial
processing. Twenty-two sections of paraffin-embedded tis-
sue were stained for Luxol fast blue, hematoxylin and eosin,
Bielschowsky silver, phosphorylated tau (ptau) (AT8),
α-synuclein, amyloid-β, and phosphorylated transactive
response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (pTDP-43) using meth-
ods described previously.16 In some cases, large coronal slabs
of the cerebral hemispheres were also cut at 50 μm on a
sledge microtome and stained as free-floating sections using
AT8 or CP-13.16,17
A neuropathological diagnosis was made using cri-
teria for CTE recently defined by the 2015 NINDS-NIBIB
Consensus Conference8 and well-established criteria for
other neuropathological diseases, including AD,18,19 Lewy
body disease,20 frontotemporal lobar degeneration,21-25 and
motor neuron disease.26,27 Neuropathological criteria
for CTE require at least 1 perivascular ptau lesion consist-
ing of ptau aggregates in neurons, astrocytes, and cell pro-
cesses around a small blood vessel; these pathognomonic
CTE lesions are most often distributed at the depths of
the sulci in the cerebral cortex and are distinct from the
lesions of aging-related tau astrogliopathy.8 Supportive fea-
tures for the diagnosis of CTE include ptau pretangles and
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in superficial cortical layers
(layers II/III) of the cerebral cortex; pretangles, NFTs or
extracellular tangles in CA2 and CA4 of the hippocampus;
subpial ptau astrocytes at the glial limitans; and dot-like
ptau neurites.8
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy ptau pathology was
classified into 4 stages using previously proposed criteria.6
Briefly, stage I CTE is characterized by 1 or 2 isolated peri-
vascular epicenters of ptau NFTs and neurites (ie, CTE
lesions) at the depths of the cerebral sulci in the frontal,
temporal, or parietal cortices. In stage II, 3 or more CTE
lesions are found in multiple cortical regions and superficial
NFTs are found along the sulcal wall and at gyral crests.
Multiple CTE lesions, superficial cortical NFTs, and diffuse
neurofibrillary degeneration of the entorhinal and perirhi-
nal cortices, amygdala, and hippocampus are found in
stage III CTE. In stage IV CTE, CTE lesions and NFTs are
densely distributed throughout the cerebral cortex, dien-
cephalon, and brain stem with neuronal loss, gliosis, and
astrocytic ptau pathology. Chronic traumatic encephalopa-
thy pathology in stages I and II is considered to be mild and
in stages III and IV is considered to be severe.
Neuropathological evaluation was blinded to the clini-
cal evaluation and was reviewed by 4 neuropathologists
(V.A., B.H., T.D.S., and A.M.); any discrepancies in the neu-
ropathological diagnosis were solved by discussion and con-
sensus of the group. In addition to diagnoses, the density of
ptau immunoreactive NFTs, neurites, diffuse amyloid-β
plaques, and neuritic amyloid-β plaques; vascular
amyloid-β; pTDP-43; and α-synuclein immunoreactive
Lewy bodies were measured semiquantitatively (0-3, with 3
being most severe) across multiple brain regions.
Descriptive statistics were generated using SPSS soft-
ware version 20 (IBM Inc).
Results
Among the 202 deceased brain donors (median age at
death, 66 years [interquartile range [IQR], 47-76 years]),
CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 (87%;
median age at death, 67 years [IQR, 52-77 years]; mean
years of football participation, 15.1 [SD, 5.2]; 140 [79%] self-
identified as white and 35 [19%] self-identified as black),
including 0 of 2 pre–high school, 3 of 14 high school (21%),
48 of 53 college (91%), 9 of 14 semiprofessional (64%),
7 of 8 Canadian Football League (88%), and 110 of 111 NFL
(99%) players.
The median age at death for participants with mild CTE
pathology (stages I and II) was 44 years (IQR, 29-64 years)
and for participants with severe CTE pathology (stages III
and IV) was 71 years (IQR, 64-79 years). The most common
cause of death for participants with mild CTE pathology
was suicide (12 [27%]) and for those with severe CTE pathol-
ogy was neurodegenerative (ie, dementia-related and
parkinsonian-related causes of death) (62 [47%]). The sever-
ity of CTE pathology was distributed across the highest level
of play, with all former high school players having mild
pathology (3 [100%]) and the majority of former college
(27 [56%]), semiprofessional (5 [56%]), Canadian Football
League (6 [86%]), and NFL (95 [86%]) players having
severe pathology. The mean duration of play for partici-
pants with mild CTE pathology was 13 years (SD, 4.2 years)
and for participants with severe CTE pathology was 15.8
years (SD, 5.3 years) (Table 1).
In all cases, perivascular clusters of ptau immunoreac-
tive NFTs diagnostic for CTE (ie, CTE lesions)8 were found in

 the cerebral cortex (Figure 1 and Figure 2). In cases with
mild CTE pathology (stages I and II), isolated perivascular
CTE lesions were found at the sulcal depths of the cerebral
cortex, most commonly in the superior and dorsolateral
frontal cortices, but also in the lateral temporal, inferior
parietal, insula, and septal cortices (Figure 1). Neurofibril-
lary tangles were sparse in other cortical regions, and there
was no diffuse neurofibrillary degeneration of the medial
temporal lobe structures (Figure 1, open arrowheads). Neu-
rofibrillary tangles were also found in the locus coeruleus,
substantia nigra, and substantia innominata (Figure 3) in
mild CTE. In cases with severe CTE pathology, perivascular
CTE lesions were large and confluent (Figure 2). Neurofibril-
lary tangles were widely distributed in the superficial lami-
nae of cortical regions and there was severe neurofibrillary
degeneration of the medial temporal lobe structures,

 including the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cor-
tex (Figure 2, black arrowheads, and Figure 3). Neurofibril-
lary tangles were also frequent in the thalamus, nucleus
basalis of Meynert, substantia innominata, substantia nigra,
and locus coeruleus in severe CTE (Figure 3).
Deposition of amyloid-β was present in a subset of par-
ticipants at all stages of CTE pathology, predominantly as
diffuse amyloid-β plaques, but neuritic amyloid-β plaques
and amyloid angiopathy were also present. In stage IV CTE,
amyloid-β deposition occurred in 52 cases (91%). Deposition
of TDP-43 and α-synuclein were found in all stages of CTE
pathology; TDP-43 deposition occurred in 47 (83%) and
α-synuclein deposition occurred in 23 (40%) stage IV CTE
cases (Table 2).
Among the 25 football players without CTE, 9 showed
no pathological abnormalities and 7 showed nonspecific
changes; eg, hemosiderin-laden macrophages (n = 7) and
axonal injury (n = 5). Other diagnoses included vascular
pathology (n = 4), unspecified tauopathy not meeting crite-
ria for CTE (n = 3), AD (n = 2), argyrophilic grain disease
(n = 1), and Lewy body disease (n = 1).
Data on informants were collected beginning in 2014.
The median number of participating informants was 2
(IQR, 1-3) per participant. Among all of the interviews,
71 (64%) included a spouse/partner, 56 (51%) included an
adult child, 27 (24%) included a sibling, 16 (14%) included
a parent, 13 (12%) included a non–first-degree relative, 8
(7.2%) included a neighbor or friend, and 4 included other
informants. Among the informants who knew the partici-
pant the longest, the mean relationship length was 45.8
years (SD, 1.5 years).
Among the 111 CTE cases with standardized informant
reports on clinical symptoms, a reported progressive clinical
course was common in participants with both mild and
severe CTE pathology, occurring in 23 (85%) mild cases
and 84 (100%) severe cases (Table 3). Behavioral or mood
symptoms were common in participants with both mild and
severe CTE pathology, with symptoms occurring in 26

behavior or cognitive symptoms) CTE cases. Motor symp-
toms were common in severe cases, occurring in 63 (75%).
Gait instability and slowness of movement occurred in 55

 mood symptoms, and 16 (14.4%; median age at death, 65.5
years [IQR, 39-78]) initially presented with both cognitive
symptoms and behavior or mood symptoms. Forty (85%) of
those initially presenting with only cognitive symptoms
were reported to have behavior or mood symptoms at the
time of death and 43 (90%) of those initially presenting with
only behavior or mood symptoms were reported to have
cognitive symptoms at the time of death. Dementia was
present at the time of death in 36 (77%) of those initially
presenting with cognitive symptoms, 33 (69%) of those ini-
tially presenting with behavior or mood symptoms, and 11
(69%) of those initially presenting with both cognitive and
behavior or mood symptoms.
The most common primary cause of death was neuro-
degenerative for all 3 groups (cognitive, 26 [55%]; behavior
or mood, 16 [33%]; both cognitive and behavior or mood, 6
[38%]). Substance use disorders, suicidality, and family his-
tory of psychiatric illness were common among those who
initially presented with behavior or mood symptoms, occur-
ring in 32 (67%), 22 (47%), and 23 (49%) cases, respectively.
Discussion
In a convenience sample of 202 deceased former players of
American football who were part of a brain donation pro-
gram, a high proportion were diagnosed neuropathologi-
cally with CTE. The severity of CTE pathology was distrib-
uted across the highest level of play, with all former high
school players having mild pathology and the majority of
former college, semiprofessional, and professional players
having severe pathology. Behavior, mood, and cognitive
symptoms were common among those with mild and severe
CTE pathology and signs of dementia were common among
those with severe CTE pathology.
Nearly all of the former NFL players in this study had
CTE pathology, and this pathology was frequently severe.
These findings suggest that CTE may be related to prior par-
ticipation in football and that a high level of play may be
related to substantial disease burden. Several other football-
related factors may influence CTE risk and disease severity,
including but not limited to age at first exposure to football,
duration of play, player position, cumulative hits, and linear
and rotational acceleration of hits. Recent work in living for-
mer football players has shown that age at first exposure
may be related to impaired cognitive performance29 and
altered corpus callosum white matter30 and that cumulative
hits may be related to impairment on self-report and objec-
tive measures of cognition, mood, and behavior,31 although
it is unclear if any of these outcomes are related to CTE
pathology. Furthermore, it is unclear if symptomatic hits
(concussions) are more important than asymptomatic hits
resulting in subconcussive injury. As with other neurode-
generative diseases, age may be related to risk and patho-
logical severity in CTE. It will be important for future stud-
ies to resolve how different measures of exposure to
football and age influence the outcome.
In cases with severe CTE pathology, accumulations of
amyloid-β, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 were common. These
findings are consistent with previous studies that show dep-
osition of multiple neurodegenerative proteins after expo-
sure to TBI32 and with work showing that neuritic amyloid-β
plaques are associated with increased CTE neuropathologi-
cal stage.33 Diagnoses of comorbid neurodegenerative
diseases, including AD, Lewy body disease, motor neuron
disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, were also
common in cases with severe CTE pathology. Overall, 19%
of participants with CTE had comorbid Lewy body disease,
which aligns with a recent observation by Crane et al34
regarding the increased prevalence of Lewy body pathology
after single TBI. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy was not
assessed in the analysis by Crane et al; to investigate the
possibility of CTE after single TBI would require more
extensive sampling of the depths of the cortical sulci with
ptau immunostaining, as silver stains typically do not
detect CTE pathology.

 Behavioral, mood, and cognitive symptoms were com-
mon among participants with either mild or severe CTE pa-
thology. In participants with severe CTE pathology, there was
marked ptau pathology in brain regions that have been asso-
ciated with symptoms frequently reported: impulsivity, de-
pressive symptoms, apathy, anxiety, and explosivity (prefron-
tal cortex, amygdala, locus coeruleus); episodic memory
symptoms (hippocampus and entorhinal and perirhinal cor-
tices); and attention and executive function symptoms
(prefrontal cortex). Participants with mild CTE pathology of-
ten had these symptoms despite having relatively circum-
scribed cortical pathology and absence of ptau pathology in
the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, or amygdala. This may
suggest that other pathologies not captured by the pathologi-
cal data set, such as neuroinflammation, axonal injury, or
astrocytosis, or pathologies in neuroanatomical regions not
evaluated contribute to these clinical symptoms. Microglial
neuroinflammation appears to precede tau accumulation in
CTE,35 suggesting it may play a role in early symptoms.
Informants reported that 43% of participants had behav-
ior or mood symptoms as their initial presentation. Many of
these participants had a substance use disorder, demon-
strated suicidality, or had a family history of psychiatric ill-
ness. Behavior or mood symptoms may be the initial presen-
tationforasubsetofindividualswithCTE,oralternatively,CTE
ptau pathology may lower the threshold for psychiatric mani-
festations in susceptible individuals. These clinical observa-
tions confirm and expand on previous reports of 2 primary
clinical presentations of CTE.9
There is substantial evidence that CTE is a progressive,
neurodegenerative disease. In this study, 107 participants
(96%) had a progressive clinical course based on informant
report. In addition, pathological severity of CTE was corre-
lated with age at death (Table 3). However, a postmortem
study evaluates brain pathology at only 1 time point and is
by definition cross-sectional. In addition, the participants
were not observed longitudinally during life. Although asso-
ciations with age in cross-sectional samples can result from
age-related progression within individuals, they can also
arise from birth cohort effects, differential survival, or age-
related differences in how individuals were selected into the
study. Population-based prospective studies are needed to
address the issue of progression of CTE pathology and age at
symptom onset.
The strengths of this study are that this is the largest CTE
case series ever described to our knowledge, more than dou-
bling the size of the 2013 report,6 and that all participants were
exposed to a relatively similar type of repetitive head trauma
while playing the same sport. In addition, the comprehensive
neuropathological evaluation and retrospective clinical data
collection were independently performed while blinded to the
findings of the other investigators.
This study had several limitations. First, a major limita-
tion is ascertainment bias associated with participation in
this brain donation program. Although the criteria for par-
ticipation were based on exposure to repetitive head trauma
rather than on clinical signs of brain trauma, public aware-
ness of a possible link between repetitive head trauma and

Stage I CTE is characterized by 1 or 2 perivascular CTE lesions at the depths of the cerebral sulci in the cerebral
cortex. In stage II, 3 or more CTE lesions are found in multiple cortical regions. In stage III CTE, many CTE lesions,
superficial cortical neurofibrillary tangles, and diffuse neurofibrillary degeneration of the entorhinal and
perirhinal cortices, amygdala, and hippocampus are found. In stage IV CTE, CTE lesions and neurofibrillary
tangles are densely distributed throughout the cerebral cortex, diencephalon, and brain stem with neuronal loss,
gliosis, and astrocytic phosphorylated tau pathology.

 CTE may have motivated players and their families with
symptoms and signs of brain injury to participate in this
research. Therefore, caution must be used in interpreting
the high frequency of CTE in this sample, and estimates of
prevalence cannot be concluded or implied from this
sample. Second, the VA-BU-CLF brain bank is not represen-

a There were 111 participants with
standardized informant reports,
including 27 participants with mild
CTE and 84 participants with severe
CTE. Sample sizes differed across
clinical features because features
marked as unknown by the clinician
were excluded. For participants with
mild CTE, sample sizes ranged from
25 to 27 and for participants with
severe CTE, sample sizes ranged
from 78 to 84. Mild CTE (CTE
neuropathological stages I and II) is
characterized by sparse to frequent
perivascular CTE lesions at the sulcal
depths of the cerebral cortex.
Severe CTE (CTE neuropathological
stages III and IV) consists of multiple
CTE lesions in the cerebral cortex
and moderate to severe
neurofibrillary degeneration of
medial temporal lobe,
diencephalon, and brain stem.

 professional level. Additionally, selection into brain banks is
associated with dementia status, depression status, marital
status, age, sex, race, and education.36 Third, this study
lacked a comparison group that is representative of all indi-
viduals exposed to American football at the college or pro-
fessional level, precluding estimation of the risk of partici-
pation in football and neuropathological outcomes.
Conclusions
In a convenience sample of deceased football players who
donated their brains for research, a high proportion had neu-
ropathological evidence of CTE, suggesting that CTE may be
related to prior participation in football.
