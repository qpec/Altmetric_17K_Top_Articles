IMPORTANCE Baby-led approaches to complementary feeding, which promote self-feeding of
all nonliquid foods are proposed to improve energy self-regulation and lower obesity risk.
However, to date, no randomized clinical trials have studied this proposition.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether a baby-led approach to complementary feeding results in a
lower body mass index (BMI) than traditional spoon-feeding.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The 2-year Baby-Led Introduction to Solids (BLISS)
randomized clinical trial recruited 206 women (168 [81.6%] of European ancestry; 85 [41.3%]
primiparous) in late pregnancy from December 19, 2012, through March 17, 2014, as part of a
community intervention in Dunedin, New Zealand. Women were randomized to a control
condition (n = 101) or the BLISS intervention (n = 105) after stratification for parity and
education. All outcomes were collected by staff blinded to group randomization, and no
participants withdrew because of an adverse event. Data were analyzed based on intention
to treat.
INTERVENTIONS Mothers in the BLISS group received lactation consultant support (�5
contacts) to extend exclusive breastfeeding and delay introduction of complementary foods
until 6 months of age and 3 personalized face-to-face contacts (at 5.5, 7.0, and 9.0 months).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was BMI z score (at 12 and 24
months). Secondary outcomes included energy self-regulation and eating behaviors assessed
with questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 months and energy intake assessed with 3-day weighed
diet records at 7, 12, and 24 months.
RESULTS Among the 206 participants (mean [SD] age, 31.3 [5.6] years), 166 were available
for analysis at 24 months (retention, 80.5%). The mean (SD) BMI z score was not significantly
different at 12 months (control group, 0.20 [0.89]; BLISS group, 0.44 [1.13]; adjusted
difference, 0.21; 95% CI, −0.07 to 0.48) or at 24 months (control group, 0.24 [1.01]; BLISS
group, 0.39 [1.04]; adjusted difference, 0.16; 95% CI, −0.13 to 0.45). At 24 months, 5 of 78
infants (6.4%) were overweight (BMI�95th percentile) in the control group compared with 9
of 87 (10.3%) in the BLISS group (relative risk, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.6-5.7). Lower satiety
responsiveness was observed in BLISS infants at 24 months (adjusted difference, −0.24; 95%
CI, −0.41 to −0.07). Parents also reported less food fussiness (adjusted difference, −0.33;
95% CI, −0.51 to −0.14) and greater enjoyment of food (adjusted difference, 0.25; 95% CI,
0.07 to 0.43) at 12 months in BLISS infants. Estimated differences in energy intake were 55 kJ
(95% CI, −284 to 395 kJ) at 12 months and 143 kJ (95% CI, −241 to 526 kJ) at 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A baby-led approach to complementary feeding did not result
in more appropriate BMI than traditional spoon-feeding, although children were reported to
have less food fussiness. Further research should determine whether these findings apply to
individuals using unmodified baby-led weaning.

uréed foods are typically used as first foods for in-
fants, with gradual exposure to more varied textures
over time. Finger foods may be consumed but do not
usually represent a large proportion of the diet until later in
the complementary feeding period.1-3 Baby-led weaning (BLW)
is an alternative approach to introducing solid foods in which
infants feed themselves all their food from the start of comple-
mentary feeding (approximately 6 months of age).4,5 Pro-
posed advantages include improved energy self-regulation
(ability to respond appropriately to appetite and satiety cues),6
leadingtoimprovedbodyweight7andreducedfoodfussiness.4
However, concerns have been raised that children may not eat
enough, particularly if self-feeding skills are poor.8-10
Despite considerable interest in BLW,11 little research has
directly examined these questions. Only 1 study has investi-
gated energy self-regulation, reporting higher satiety respon-
siveness and less food fussiness in young children who had
been weaned using BLW compared with traditional
spoon-feeding.12 Two studies have reported a lower risk for
overweight in BLW infants,12,13 but both studies used paren-
tal reports of child weight, which can be inaccurate in younger
children.14 Only 1 study has assessed energy intake, reporting
similar intakes in BLW and spoon-fed infants.15 These exist-
ing observational data are further limited because growth pat-
terns in self-selected individuals may be biased by differ-
ences in demographic variables. In particular, mothers who
followBLWtendtobemorehighlyeducated,tobreastfeedlon-
ger, and to return to work later,16 factors that also affect child
growth.17,18
The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to deter-
mine whether allowing infants to control their own food in-
take by feeding themselves solid foods using a baby-led ap-
proachtocomplementaryfeedingresultsindifferencesinbody
mass index (BMI) z scores (primary outcome) and in second-
ary outcomes of energy self-regulation, eating behaviors, and
energy intake at 12 and 24 months of age compared with tra-
ditional spoon-feeding.
Methods
The Baby-Led Introduction to Solids (BLISS) study adheres to
the principles of BLW (the infant feeds himself or herself fam-
ily foods with the family, ideally while breastfeeding on de-
mand) but was modified in response to concerns regarding po-
tentialgrowthfaltering,irondeficiency,andchoking.19Because
the protocol20 and pilot study21 have been published, only rel-
evantinformationisincludedherein.Thetrialprotocolisfound
in Supplement 1. The study was approved by the Lower South
Regional Ethics Committee of New Zealand, and written in-
formed consent was obtained from all adult participants be-
fore randomization.
Women were recruited in late pregnancy from sequential
bookings (December 19, 2012, through March 17, 2014) at the
only maternity hospital in Dunedin, New Zealand. Exclusion
criteria consisted of not living locally, mother younger than 16
years, booking after 34 weeks gestation, prematurity, or con-
genitalabnormalitylikelytoaffectfeedingorgrowth.Twohun-
dred and six of 879 women approached (response rate, 23.4%)
were randomized by the study biostatistician (S.M.W.) to the
control (n = 101) or BLISS (n = 105) group using random-
lengthblocks(maximumof7)afterstratificationforparity(first
child and subsequent child) and maternal educational attain-
ment (nontertiary and tertiary) (Figure 1). Allocation was con-
cealed using opaque presealed envelopes, and the biostatis-
tician used uninformative group codes until primary analyses
were completed.
Allfamilieshadaccesstogovernment-fundedroutinemid-
wifery and well-child care.22,23 The BLISS group received 8 ad-
ditional contacts from pregnancy to 9 months of age. Five con-
tacts(3face-to-faceand2telephone;10-60minuteseach)were
byaninternationalboard-certifiedlactationconsultant(R.S.D.)
antenatally and at 1 and 3 to 4 weeks and 3 to 4 and 5 months.
These contacts provided education and support for prolong-
ing milk feeding (ideally exclusive breastfeeding), in keeping
with BLW, and delaying the introduction of complementary
foods until 6 months, at which time infants were considered
to be developmentally ready to self-feed.20 Additional sup-
port could be requested. Three additional contacts (face-to-
face; 30-60 minutes each) by a trained researcher (E.A.F. and
J.M.) when the infant was 5.5, 7.0, and 9.0 months of age pro-
vided individualized advice and support to (1) wait until 6
monthsbeforeintroducingsolidfoods;(2)useresponsivefeed-
ing practices, paying attention to hunger and satiety cues; (3)
provide high-iron and high-energy foods at each meal and
avoid foods posing a choking risk; and (4) offer foods easy to
pick up and eat and more frequent milk feeds during illness
and recovery. Extensive pretested BLISS resources21 for use be-
tween study contacts detailed feeding in a baby-led manner,
food ideas and recipe books suitable for each age, and safety
information, particularly regarding choking.20
Adherence to a baby-led approach was measured by ques-
tionnaire at 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, and 24 months (eg, “How has your
baby been fed their solids in the past week?”). Adherence was
defined as the infants feeding themselves most or all their food
in the previous week.20
Hospital records provided information on infant birth
weight and sex, maternal parity, and level of household
deprivation.24 The baseline questionnaire, completed before
Key Points
Question Does a baby-led approach to complementary feeding
reduce the risk for overweight?
Findings In the randomized clinical trial Baby-Led Introduction to
Solids with 206 participating mothers, the mean body mass index
z score of infants who followed a modified version of baby-led
weaning was not different at 12 (0.44) or 24 (0.39) months of age
compared with infants who followed traditional spoon-feeding
(0.20 and 0.24, respectively). No evidence suggested a difference
in the prevalence of overweight.
Meaning A baby-led approach to complementary feeding does
not appear to result in healthier growth or a reduced risk for
overweight compared with traditional feeding practices.

 randomization in late pregnancy, assessed maternal educa-
tional attainment, employment status, and ethnicity (New
Zealand Census questions; http://www.stats.govt.nz), self-
reported prepregnancy height and weight, and how mothers
intended to introduce solid foods.
All outcome assessments were collected by researchers
blinded to group allocation (L.J.F., L.D., B.M., and L.W.E.) (July
31, 2013, through April 26, 2016). Infant weight was mea-
sured on an electronic scale (model 334; Seca), and length was
measured on a 100-cm board (Rollameter; Harlow Health-
care) in duplicate in accordance with World Health Organiza-
tion protocols.25 Length was obtained at 6, 12, and 24 months
and weight at 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, and 24 months. We calculated BMI
(weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) at
12 and 24 months; z scores (primary outcome) were created
using World Health Organization reference data.26 Over-
weight was defined as a BMI at or above the 95th percentile
for age and sex.26
Secondary outcomes were assessed by questionnaire at 12
and 24 months. For energy self-regulation, parents indicated
the extent to which they agreed with 8 statements about their
child’
s ability to know when they were full27 (Cronbach α, .81-
.85).TheyalsocompletedtheChildren’
sEatingBehaviorQues-
tionnaire (CEBQ),28 which measures satiety responsiveness
(eating appropriately in response to appetite) and food respon-
siveness (eating in response to environmental food cues rather
than hunger) (Cronbach α, .67-.78). Eating behavior was as-
sessed as enjoyment of food (having a positive attitude to food)
and food fussiness (rejection of new and familiar foods)28 from
the CEBQ (Cronbach α, .85-.90). The person who made meal-
timedecisions,levelofcaregiverdistress,andwhetherthechild
was a picky eater were determined from the Toddler-Parent
Mealtime Behavior Questionnaire29 (TMBQ; 12 months only;
Cronbach α, .54-.83).
Energy intake at 7, 12, and 24 months of age was deter-
mined from 3-day weighed diet records collected on ran-
domly assigned days (1 weekend day and 2 weekdays) during
3 weeks. Estimated total daily volumes were used for breast
milk (750 g/d at 7 months,30 448 g/d at 12 months,30 and 59
g/breastfeed at 24 months31). For infants with mixed feeding,
the reported volume of formula was subtracted from 750 g at
7 months or 448 g at 12 months, with the remainder entered
as breast milk (no child consumed formula at 24 months). Par-
ticipants received written and oral instructions for complet-
ing the records, including careful recording of leftovers. Diet
records were analyzed using the Kai-culator program (ver-
sion 1.13s; University of Otago), which uses the New Zealand
Food Composition Database (FOODfiles 2010), nutrient data
for commonly consumed recipes from national nutrition sur-
vey data, and nutrient data for commercial infant foods col-
lated by the research team.20
Brief feeding questionnaires were administered at 2, 4, 6,
7, 8, 9, 12, and 24 months of age. The following data were de-
termined prospectively: weeks of exclusive breastfeeding (no
other liquids or solids since birth), age when complementary
foods were first introduced, age when the infant was feeding
himself or herself regularly, and age when the infant was feed-
ing himself or herself all his or her food.20
Data on adverse events (untoward medical occurrence
that did not necessarily have a causal association with the
intervention32) were collected actively (growth faltering,
choking, or iron deficiency19) and passively (participant
concerns as they were reported to us). A study pediatrician
(B.J.W.) blinded to group allocation was consulted if any of 5
growth triggers were met (eTable in Supplement 2), and
appropriate follow-up was initiated. Growth faltering was
defined as a decrease in the weight z score of more than
1.34.20 Data on choking33 and iron deficiency34 have been
reported elsewhere.
Statistical Analysis
Based on a mean (SD) BMI of 17.3 (1.4) and a correlation be-
tween repeated measures (BMI at 6-12 months) of 0.78,35 our
studyhad80%powertodetectadifferenceinBMIof0.40with
85 infants in each group (equivalent to a BMI z score of 0.29)
with a type I error rate of 0.05. Data were analyzed according
to intention to treat according to CONSORT guidelines,36 based
on those who had at least 1 follow-up BMI measure, using
STATA software (version 13; StataCorp). Linear mixed-effects
models with participant-level random intercepts were used to
estimate the difference in BMI z score (primary outcome) and
BMI (secondary outcome) between the BLISS and control
groups, and logistic regression (because the prevalence was
low) was used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs
for being overweight. Chained equations were used to esti-
mate missing values with a model that included age, weight,

 length, and BMI and terms for sex, parity, maternal educa-
tional attainment, household deprivation, marital status, and
weeks of exclusive breastfeeding. For this imputation, 50 data
sets were generated using 1000 burn-ins for each set. Esti-
mates for BMI z score and BMI were obtained from the im-
puteddatasetsandtheoriginaldataset,andtheresidualswere
checked for normality.
We used Kaplan-Meier curves to illustrate the age at which
infants started feeding themselves and compared the groups
using a log-rank test. Analyses of differences between groups
for adherence to a baby-led approach to feeding were limited
to those who were eating solids and are presented as RRs (95%
CI). Regression analysis was used to compare the groups for
energy self-regulation and eating behaviors, adjusting for birth
weight, infant age and sex, and the stratification variables (first
vs subsequent child and tertiary vs nontertiary maternal edu-
cational attainment). Energy intake was analyzed similarly
using quantile (median) regression.
Results
Among the 206 mothers randomized (mean [SD] age, 31.3 [5.6]
years), 168 (81.6%) were of European ancestry and 85 (41.3%)
were primiparous. Before randomization, most mothers
planned to follow traditional spoon-feeding, with few expect-
ing their infant to feed themselves (45 [21.8%]) or to use solely
finger foods (39 [18.9%]) (Table 1). Women who participated
were less likely to be from deprived households (44 of 206
[21.4%] vs the national average [30.0%]; P = .007) but re-
ported similar ethnicity (81.6% vs 584 of 751 [77.8%] Euro-
pean; P = .12) and parity (41.3% vs 319 of 751 [42.5%] first child;
P = .82) to nonparticipants. A total of 166 mothers were avail-
able for the 24-month analysis (retention, 80.5%) (Figure 1).

RR for being overweight in the BLISS compared with control
groups was 2.5 (95% CI, 0.9-6.9) at 12 months and 1.8 (95% CI,
0.6-5.7) at 24 months. When the analysis was restricted to the
complete cases, we found no significant adjusted differences
in BMI z score at 12 (0.23; 95% CI, −0.06 to 0.52) or 24 (0.15;

at 24 months.
The results for energy self-regulation and eating behav-
iors are presented in Table 2. Parents indicated that BLISS
infants were less satiety responsive than control infants at
24 months (adjusted difference, −0.24; 95% CI, −0.41 to
−0.07). Mothers of BLISS infants rated their infants as sig-
nificantly less fussy or picky about food, whether measured
by the CEBQ (adjusted difference, −0.33; 95% CI, −0.51 to
−0.14) or TMBQ (adjusted difference, −0.22; 95% CI, −0.41 to
−0.04) at 12 months of age, although not at 24 months.
Mothers of BLISS infants were also more likely to report a
positive attitude to food (enjoyment of food) at 12 (adjusted
difference, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07-0.43) and 24 (adjusted differ-

 ence, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.05-0.43) months (CEBQ) and made sig-
nificantly more mealtime decisions than control infants at 12
months (adjusted difference, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.01-0.31)
(TMBQ). We observed no evidence of statistically significant
differences in energy intake at any point. Prevalence of over-
weight did not differ significantly between the control and
BLISS groups at 12 months (5 of 84 [6.0%] vs 14 of 93 [15.1%];
RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 0.9-6.9) or 24 months (5 of 78 [6.4%] vs 9 of
87 [10.3%]; RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.6-5.7). Differences were com-
puted using imputed values for the control and BLISS groups
and analyzed using Poisson regression.
BLISS infants were exclusively breastfed for longer (me-
dian, 21.7 weeks; 95% CI, 13.0-23.8 weeks) compared with
control infants (median, 17.3 weeks; 95% CI, 6.0-21.7 weeks;
P = .002), and 62 (64.6%) met the WHO guideline37,38 for
delaying solid foods until 6 months compared with 17
(18.1%) of control infants. Considerable differences were also
observed in the age when infants first fed themselves
(Figure 2). Table 3 indicates that BLISS infants were more
likely to feed themselves most or all of their food than con-
trol infants at every age.
Two serious adverse events33 were reported (1 in the
control group and 1 in the BLISS group); both resulted in hos-
pital admissions owing to choking on milk, not related to the
intervention. No infant met the criterion for growth falter-
ing. Of the 32 infants who met at least 1 growth trigger (16 in
the control and 16 in the BLISS groups) (eTable in the
Supplement 2), 19 had further follow-up, but all showed
improvements over time, indicating that any slowing of
weight gain was transient. We found no significant group

 Discussion
Our randomized clinical trial suggests that allowing infants
greater control over their eating by using a baby-led approach
to complementary feeding does not result in more appropri-
ate body weight up to 24 months of age than traditional spoon-
feeding. In fact, mothers reported that BLISS infants ap-
peared to be less, rather than more, responsive to appetite at
24 months of age than control infants (although this was seen
for just 1 measure of energy self-regulation at 1 point, and no
differences were observed in energy intake at any time). Our
results also refute concerns that infants using a baby-led ap-
proach to complementary feeding may not eat enough food,19
with no children showing growth faltering. Interestingly, In-
fants in the BLISS group showed less food fussiness and greater
enjoyment of food than control infants.
Despite marked interest in baby-led approaches,11 mini-
mal research has directly evaluated the advantages and dis-
advantages of this alternative approach to complementary
feeding. Our results are in direct contrast with the only other
study that has examined energy self-regulation,12 in which
higher satiety responsiveness was reported in young children
using BLW. Moreover, whereas previous research has sug-
gested that BLW infants are less likely to be overweight12,13 and
more likely to be underweight,13 the 95% CI for our data does
notexcludeapotentiallyimportantincreaseintheriskforover-
weight. These discrepancies may have arisen because exist-
ing observational studies used infant weight reported by par-
ents, which is known to be inaccurate,14 whereas we measured
weight.However,themostlikelyexplanationisrelatedtostudy
design. Parents who choose to use BLW are known to differ
demographically16 and in the degree of maternal control over
child eating39 from parents using more traditional infant feed-
ing practices, and these characteristics are related to growth18
and eating behaviors.40 By contrast, our randomized design
should remove group differences in known and unknown con-
founders.Neitherthepresentstudynortheonlyexistingstudy
in infants examining energy intake in BLW15 has demon-
strated a statistically significant difference in energy intake be-
tween those using a baby-led approach to infant feeding and
those using spoon-feeding. The difference in exclusive breast-
feeding rates between the BLISS and control groups in the
present study is unlikely to explain the findings given that ex-
isting literature generally supports breastfeeding being pro-
tective against obesity.41 Therefore, energy intake, energy self-
regulation, and body weight should be investigated in studies
of infants using unmodified BLW, ideally alongside spoon-
fed infants matched for key demographic variables.
Our results also suggest that use of a baby-led approach
might change attitudes toward food, as has been indicated
previously.12 In our study, parents reported that BLISS in-
fants had a better attitude toward food at 12 and 24 months
and were less fussy about food (at 12 months) than control in-
fants. Because of the strong genetic component to food
fussiness,42 the relatively large effect of this baby-led ap-
proach is of interest. The differences that we observed can be
considered as a moderate effect and are likely to be impor-
tant to parents because food fussiness can cause consider-
able stress.43,44
Strengths and Limitations
The main strengths of our study include the randomized clini-
cal design, rigorous assessment of energy intake, high levels
of adherence, and collection of growth data by trained asses-
sors blinded to intervention status. We were careful to em-
phasize to participants the importance of measuring foods that
were offered but not eaten (leftovers), and the energy intakes

quirements for infants aged 12 months (3500 kJ for boys and
3200kJforgirls45).Ourrepeatedassessmentofadherencepro-
vides confidence that the lack of intervention effect that we
observed was not a result of poor adherence. Our data dem-
onstrate that families randomized to a baby-led approach to
feeding are able to adhere when provided with suitable guid-
ance and support. The level of adherence among individuals
using BLW without this support is less certain.
Ourstudyalsohassomelimitations.Thesamplewassmall,
but we reported 95% CIs to show the range of plausible values
for the differences. We were able to examine growth faltering
only in descriptive terms because large studies would be re-
quired to detect differences in the prevalence of growth
faltering.46,47 However, our findings should provide reassur-
ance to parents and health care professionals who have ex-
pressedconcernregardingthecapacityofyoungchildrentofeed
themselves sufficient amounts of food.19,48 Because our BLISS
approach included modifications to BLW specifically de-
signed to reduce the likelihood of growth faltering,20 unmodi-
fiedBLWmaynothavethesameeffects.AlthoughBMIdatawere

of growth data indicates that the missing data did not affect in-
terpretationofthemainoutcomes.Finally,oursamplewasrela-

Conclusions
A baby-led approach to complementary feeding does not ap-
pear to improve energy self-regulation or body weight when
compared with more traditional feeding practices, although
some benefits may accrue in attitudes to food, including re-
duced food fussiness. Additional research is required to de-
