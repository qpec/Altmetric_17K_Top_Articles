Abstract 
Objective: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) 
activity. The intestinal microbiota has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Dietary 
omega-3 PUFAs alter the mouse intestinal microbiome compatible with anti-neoplastic 
activity. Therefore, we investigated the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplements on the faecal 
microbiome in middle-aged, healthy volunteers (n=22).    
Design: A randomized, open-label, crossover ����� �� � ������ ��������� ���� � � ����� 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in two formulations (soft-gel 
�������� ��� S��������� �������, separated by � �� ���� ��������� ������. Faecal samples 
were collected at five time-points for microbiome analysis by 16S rRNA PCR and Illumina 
MiSeq sequencing. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid analysis was performed by liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.   
Results: Both omega-3 PUFA formulations induced similar changes in RBC fatty acid content, 
except that drinks were associated with a larger, and more prolonged, decrease in omega-6 
PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) than the capsule intervention (P=0.02). There were no significant 
changes in a or b diversity, or phyla composition, associated with omega-3 PUFA 
supplementation. However, a reversible increased abundance of several genera, including 
Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, and Lactobacillus, was observed with one or both omega-3 PUFA 
interventions. Microbiome changes did not correlate with RBC omega-3 PUFA incorporation 
or development of omega-3 PUFA-induced diarrhoea. There were no treatment order effects.     
Conclusion: Omega-3 PUFA supplementation induces a reversible increase in several short-
chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, independently of the method of administration. There is 
no simple relationship between the intestinal microbiome and systemic omega-3 PUFA 
exposure. ISRCTN18662143.

Introduction 
The two main omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 
C20:53) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:63) are widely used as nutritional  
supplements, as fish oil or �� ���� ������������ ��������������� �����[1] Multiple health 
benefits have been claimed for these long-chain omega-3 PUFAs, including secondary 
prevention of ischaemic heart disease,[2] treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [3] and anti-
cancer activity,[4] some of which are supported by evidence from randomised trials.[5-6] 
The mechanism(s) underlying the colorectal cancer (CRC) chemopreventative activity of 
EPA reported by West et al is unclear.[5] It has been proposed that the intestinal microbiota 
may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis based on the association of CRC with a specific 
intestinal microbiome profile, or so-called dysbiosis, characterised by low phylogenetic 
diversity, altered Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes ratio, under-representation of short-chain fatty 
acid (SCFA)-producing genera such as Roseburia and Eubacterium, as well as presence of 
putative pathobionts such as Fusobacterium nucleatum.[7-8] One possibility is that 
modulation of the intestinal microbiota may contribute to the cancer preventative properties 
of omega-3 PUFAs. 
Data from mouse models suggest that dietary omega-3 PUFA intake or high tissue levels 
of omega-3 PUFAs are associated with differences in intestinal microbiota, including 
increased quantities of certain genera, including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.[9-10] 
There has been only one case report of the effect of an omega-3 PUFA-rich diet on human 
intestinal microbiota.[11] In this case, there was a notable increase in several SCFA (butyrate)-
producing genera including Blautia, Bacterioides, Roseburia and Coprococcus.[11] 
Therefore, a plausible hypothesis is that omega-3 PUFA intake alters the composition of 
human intestinal microbiota, thereby attenuating the intestinal dysbiosis associated with 
colorectal carcinogenesis. 
Nutritional supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs can occur in several ways, either as 
unrefined fish oil, �� ��������������� ����� ������� �� ��� ������������ �� ����� ����� ��������� 
in soft-gel capsules, taken with food, or more recently as an emulsion in drink form.[1] 
In order to address the above hypothesis and, at the same time, compare two different 
formulations of omega-3 PUFAs, we performed a randomised, open-label, crossover study of 
the effect of omega-3 PUFAs on the intestinal microbiome of healthy volunteers aged over 50 
 6 
 
years (a population relevant to CRC screening and chemoprevention), thus comparing 
equivalent doses of equimolar amounts of EPA and DHA in capsule or drink form, with an 
integrated ��������� ������, with which to determine reversibility.

Methods 
Study design and interventions 
The randomized, crossover trial was carried out in the Human Appetite Research Unit 
(HARU), University of Leeds. Approval was obtained from the South Yorkshire Research Ethics 
Committee (15/YH/0142). Interventions were not classified as Investigational Medicinal 
Product by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The study was 
registered with ISRCTN (18662143). 
Healthy volunteers aged � 50 years of both sexes were sought using a HARU volunteer 
database and advertising across the University. Participants received £20 per study visit. At a 
screening visit, the following exclusion criteria were considered: ongoing or planned regular 
use of other omega-3 PUFA or cod-liver oil supplements; seafood allergy; concomitant use of 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, including aspirin; current treatment for any 
chronic inflammatory condition or malignancy; previous colonic or small bowel resection; 
current smoker (minimum 6 months smoking cessation); and pregnancy. If an individual was 
eligible, he/she ��������� � �����-��� �����-test of the peach-flavoured drink and also 
swallowed two study capsules with water, after providing written informed consent, in order 
to confirm likely compliance and minimise drop-out.   
Visit 1 occurred within 2 weeks of the screening visit, at which participants were 
randomised to take either 1) two 200 ml Smartfish® Remune drinks (see Supplementary 
Methods for content) per day (providing approximately 2000 mg EPA and 2000 mg DHA, as 
the triglyceride) at any suitable time of day, or 2) Four soft-gel capsules (each containing 250 
mg EPA and 250 mg DHA as the ethyl ester) twice daily with meals (providing 2000 mg EPA 
and 2000 mg DHA per day), both for eight weeks (Intervention A; Figure 1). After a 12-week 
�washout� period, participants took the second intervention for 8 weeks (Intervention B; 
Figure 1). We also included a final study visit after a second 12-���� ��������� ������ (V5; 
Figure 1). Randomisation was performed by Leeds Teaching Hospitals Pharmacy using random 
permuted block allocation in concealed envelopes. Neither participants nor researchers were 
blinded to the interventions and hence allocation order. 
At each visit, adverse event (AE) monitoring was undertaken by a brief interview based on 
questioning for recognised AEs of omega-3 PUFA supplements, including loss of appetite, 
eructation �������� ��������, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, as 
well as bleeding events. Review of AEs was performed by an Independent Data Monitoring 
 8 
 
Committee every three months. Tolerability of both drinks and capsules was assessed with a 
Palatability Questionnaire and capsule acceptability questionnaire at the end of each eight-
week intervention period (either visit 2 & 4). Participant height and weight were measured at 
the start of the study. 
Blood and urine were collected at each visit and a faecal sample (obtained with a Fe-C��� 
faecal collection device) was returned by hand or by Royal Mail Safebox® within 2 days of 
each visit. Participants did not start either intervention until the baseline (visit 1 or 3) faecal 
sample had been collected. Faecal samples were stored at -20oC in RNAlater® (Thermofisher 
Scientific) until DNA extraction, which occurred within 2 weeks of collection, in the majority 
of cases. 
Omega-3 PUFA measurement    
Red blood cells (RBCs) were obtained from whole blood EDTA samples as described.[12] 
Samples were stored at -80oC until lipid extraction and measurement of fatty acids by liquid-
chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described.[13] Data are 
presented as the % (w/w) content of the total fatty acid pool measured.[13] 
Intestinal microbiome analysis   
Microbial DNA extraction, PCR and Illumina sequencing were performed as described (see 
Supplementary Methods).[14]  
De-multiplexed FASTQ files were trimmed of adapter sequences using cutadapt.[15] Paired 
reads were merged using fastq-join [16] under default settings and then converted to FASTA 
format. Consensus sequences were removed if they contained any ambiguous base calls, two 
contiguous bases with a PHRED quality score lower than 33 or a length more than 2 bp 
different from the expected length of 240 bp. Further analysis was performed using QIIME.[17] 
Operational taxonomy units (OTUs) were picked using Usearch,[18] and aligned to the 
Greengenes reference database using PyNAST.[19] Taxonomy was assigned using the RDP 2.2 
classifier.[20] The resulting OTU biom files from the above analyses were imported in MEGAN 
for detailed group specific analyses, annotations and plots.[21] 
As well as comparisons of observed taxa, rarefication was performed to various levels to 
������� � ���������� A�� ������ ���� �������� �� ��� ������ ���� ������� ��� � ��������� 
calculated using weighted and unweighted UniFrac as well as the non-phylogenetic Bray-
Curtis dissimilarity measure.[14] � ��������� ��� �������� ����� Principal Coordinate Analysis 
 9 
 
(PCoA) on all samples. Correlations between the microbiome and RBC fatty acid data were 
computed using ������� �H�����,[22] in R.[23]  
Endpoints and sample size calculation 
In the absence of any data on the effect of omega-3 PUFAs on human intestinal microbiota, 
we determined the sample size based on testing non-inferiority of the drink formulation 
�������� ���� �������� ��� ��� ‘BC ����� �������� ����� � ������ ������� There are no prior 
RBC omega-3 PUFA data available in subjects consuming Smartfish® Remune. However, based 
on data from healthy individuals consuming omega-3 PUFA capsules that reported intra-
individual variability of 4%,[24] we set a non-inferiority margin of 3%. Assuming participant 
drop-out of 20%, we estimated that a sample size of 20 participants would be required in 
order to exclude a difference in combined levels of RBC EPA and DHA between the 
intervention groups of greater or equal to 0.3 absolute % points, with 90% power at a 
significance level of 0.05. 
Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. T�� ������ S�������� �-test was used to 
evaluate the difference between RBC omega-3 PUFA levels for participants who completed 
both intervention periods. Unpaired data from participants, who did not complete both 
intervention periods, were included in unpaired data analyses. Comparison of absolute pre- 
and post-supplementation levels of RBC omega-3 PUFA levels within intervention groups was 
by ������ S�������� �-test. Adverse events in each group were compared by Chi-squared 
analysis. 
For intestinal microbiota analysis, OTU read numbers at different time-points for the two 
interventions were compared by unpaired and paired analysis. Having excluded a significant 
treatment order effect on both RBC omega-3 PUFA incorporation and the intestinal 
microbiome profile, data for the capsule intervention (termed Int1) and the drinks 
intervention (termed Int2) were combined regardless of the intervention order (either A or 
B).

Results 
Twenty-two participants were randomised between July 2015 and April 2016 (Figure 1). 
There were 12 females and 10 males with a median age of 57 years (range 51-65 years) and 
a median body mass index of 27.1 Kg/m2 (range 22.0-33.8 Kg/m2). Both interventions were 
well tolerated with good acceptability scores (Supplementary Results). Two individuals 
withdrew from the study during intervention period A (both capsules) because of an AE. One 
individual did not take drinks because of concern about calorific intake, but remained in the 
study. Of those individuals completing intervention periods for drinks (n=16) and capsules 
(n=20), the median duration of the intervention period was 57 (range 54-59) and 57 (55-63) 
days respectively. 
Symptoms reported during all capsule interventions (n=22) and all drink interventions 
(n=19) are detailed in Table 1. In general, there was an excess of treatment-emergent AEs 
during the capsule intervention, particularly for dyspeptic symptoms (heartburn, acid 
regurgitation). All AEs were defined as minor (any symptom experienced during intervention, 
but did not require cessation of intervention or dose reduction) except for three AEs in each 
group that were classified as moderate (any symptom experienced that required subsequent 
dose reduction or cessation of intervention) and led to cessation of the intervention. All the 
AEs during the capsule intervention and the AEs in 9/10 individuals during the drink 
intervention had resolution of the AE during washout, suggesting that these were definite 
adverse reactions.   
Changes in RBC omega-3 PUFA content 
Fatty acid analysis was performed on those samples from participants who completed one 
or both intervention periods and washout (n=20). Only three individuals did not complete a 
second intervention-washout cycle with full blood sampling. Overall, 98 RBC samples 
underwent lipid extraction for omega-3 PUFA analysis. Data were available for 97 samples as 
one sample did not extract well and was uninterpretable.  
Individual PUFA data are represented as the absolute % level, change between baseline 
and the post-treatment level� ��� ���������� ������� �������� ��� ��������� ����� in Figure 
2. Data for the order of intervention (drinks then capsules or capsules then drinks) are shown 
only for EPA and DHA (Figure 2A and B). T�� ��ashout� ������ ��� ������ was effective with 
return to baseline RBC levels of EPA and DHA for both drinks and capsules, for either order of 
intervention. There was a lower post-treatment % RBC content of EPA or DHA (Figure 2A and 
 11 
 
B) if drinks were consumed after capsules compared with the opposite intervention order, 
but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no intervention order effects 
on content of the other fatty acids measured (data not shown). 
As there was no significant difference in RBC PUFA levels related to the order of 
intervention, data for individual PUFAs were pooled, independently of the intervention order, 
for the further comparison of drinks and capsules (Figure 2C-F). Baseline and post-treatment 
levels of EPA, DPA and DHA were well matched with no significant difference between the 
post-treatment level of EPA and DHA attained following consumption of drinks or capsules 
(Figure 2C and E). The mean individual difference between the combined RBC EPA and DHA 
level attained after the drink intervention and that attained after capsule use was -0.12 (95% 
confidence interval -1.84 to 1.61; n=16 paired data), thereby confirming non-inferiority of the 
drink formulation compared with capsules for omega-3 PUFA incorporation in RBCs.  There 
was little conversion to C22:5-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) from EPA (Figure 3D). 
Incomplete washout of DHA from RBC membranes after the capsule intervention was 
observed unlike that after the drink intervention (Figure 2E). Drink intake was associated with 
a larger decrease in relative C20:4-6 arachidonic acid (AA) content compared with capsules, 
which remained evident at the end of washout (Figure 2F). However, there was no statistical 
post-treatment difference in the % AA content between drink and capsule use (Figure 2F). 
The omega-3/omega-6 ratio is commonly used as a biomarker of omega-3 PUFA 
bioactivity.[12] Therefore, we examined the effect of drink consumption and capsule intake 
on the EPA+DHA/AA ratio (Figure 2G). The larger decrease in AA content contributed to the 
higher EPA+DHA/AA ratio gained after use of drinks compared with capsules (Figure 2G), a 
difference which was statistically significant (P=0.02).  
Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate individual EPA and DHA profiles based on 
intervention order. As expected, there was wide variability in omega-3 PUFA incorporation 
between individuals. In general, EPA profiles were less variable, for both capsule and drink 
interventions (Supplementary Figure 1), than for RBC DHA levels, both within and between 
individuals (Supplementary Figure 2). Incorporation of either EPA or DHA with one 
intervention did not predict the individual response to the other intervention. 
Changes in the intestinal microbiome 
A faecal sample was collected at all five time-points from all 20 volunteers. Three samples 
were excluded from PCR amplification because of repeated poor quality DNA extraction, 
 12 
 
leaving 97 samples that were analysed (median 46603 reads; min 26387, max 114130). Bray-
Curtis PCoA of all samples considering all taxonomic levels is shown in Figure 3A. Inter-
individual differences in the intestinal microbiome exceeded any treatment effect of omega-
3 PUFA in either capsule or drink form. In particular, volunteers #8 and #13 were markedly 
different from the others related to a reduced proportion of Clostridia and a larger proportion 
of the class Gammaproteobacteria with high abundance of Succinivibrionaceae 
(Supplementary Figure 3). For unpaired analysis of microbiome profiles across time points, 
data from these volunteers were excluded. Volunteer #16 also had a different microbiome 
with very high abundance of Succinivibrionaceae, but the rest of the taxonomic groups in this 
case were consistent with the other volunteers (Supplementary Figure 4). Therefore, we did 
not exclude this (#16) ������������ ���� from further analysis.  For the subsequent analyses, 
all capsule (termed Int1) and drink (termed Int2) intervention data were combined, regardless 
of the order of the interventions, on the basis of complete tissue (RBC) omega-3 PUFA 
washout and similarity of the microbiome profile at the two baseline assessments at visit 1 
and visit 3 for either order of interventions (Supplementary Figure 5). The cladogram 
highlights that the omega-3 PUFA intervention, either as capsules or as drinks, was not 
associated with any significant overall taxonomic shift (Figure 3B). There was no significant 
change in a (Shannon diversity index) or b (unweighted and weighted unifrac distance) 
diversity at the end of each intervention period (Int1.2 and Int2.2) compared with baseline 
(Int1.1 and Int2.1) or the final washout time-point (V5) (Figure 3C). 
The Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes (F/B) ratio is frequently reported in cohort studies 
investigating the relationship between intestinal dysbiosis and CRC.[7] However, neither 
capsule nor drink intake were associated with statistically significant changes in the F/B ratio 
(supplementary Figure 6).  
However, presentation of data at individual family- and genus-level revealed consistent 
differences associated with both capsule omega-3 PUFA and drink omega-3 PUFA 
interventions that returned towards baseline upon cessation (Figure 3D). For example, some 
relatively 
low 
abundance 
families 
including 
Clostridiaceae, 
Sutterellaceae 
and 
Akkermansiaceae were each increased at the end of both interventions with reversibility after 
the washout period (Figure 3D). A similar phenomenon was observed at genus level, for 
example Oscillospira and Lachnospira (Figure 3D). Individual histograms are shown for the top 
five abundant genera in Figure 4A-E� ����� ��������� ������� ���������� ���� � ������ 
 13 
 
intervention with capsules or drinks, each time with reversibility after 12 weeks. 
Supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs was associated with increased abundance of 
Bifidobacterium, Oscillospira, Lachnospira and a reduction in abundance of Coprococcus and 
Faecalibacterium (Figure 4A-E). We also performed a paired analysis, in which OTU read 
numbers for the top 20 genera were compared before and after capsule or drink interventions 
within individuals. This confirmed that Bifidobacterium and Oscillospira (increase), as well as 
Coprococcus (decrease), changed most for both interventions, whereas an increase in 
Roseburia and Lachnospira abundance was prominent only after the drink omega-3 PUFA 
intervention (Figure 5). A paired t test comparing the treatment effect (in OTU reads) between 
the capsule and drink intervention for the 17 individuals who had complete paired (before 
and after intervention) data revealed that the drink intervention was associated with 
increased abundance compared with capsules for Roseburia only (P<0.05). Mouse studies 
have consistently demonstrated an increase in Lactobacillus abundance after dietary fish oil 
supplementation.[9-10,25-26] Therefore, we analysed changes in this lower abundance genus 
following both omega-3 PUFA interventions. There was an increase in Lactobacillus OTU 
number after both interventions that returned towards baseline values after washout (Figure 
4F). However, these differences were not statistically significant between baseline and post-
intervention time-points (P=0.11 capsules; P=0.9 drinks) or comparing drinks versus capsules 
in a pair-wise manner (P=0.59). Fusobacterium spp. (including nucleatum) were not detected 
in faeces from this cohort of non-cancer individuals.     
There was no effect of gender on baseline microbiome profile or treatment effect of either 
omega-3 PUFA intervention (data not shown). We also tested whether development of 
diarrhoea on omega-3 PUFA supplementation was associated with a shift in the intestinal 
microbiome. There was no consistent profile observed in stool samples collected at the visit 
during/after which diarrhoea was reported (Supplementary Figure 7). Moreover, we 
investigated whether the RBC EPA and DHA levels generated by each of the interventions 
correlated with changes in the intestinal microbiome. Correspondence analysis and 
correlation testing did not demonstrate any consistent relationship between RBC EPA/DHA 
levels and microbiome profile, with the relationship for EPA and DHA being weak in 
comparison with the other FAs tested (Supplementary Figure 8).

Discussion 
We report small, consistent and reversible changes in the human intestinal microbiome 
associated with omega-3 PUFA supplementation for 8 weeks. The lack of significant change 
in microbial diversity associated with omega-3 PUFA intervention is consistent with mouse 
studies, in which there was either no change,[10] or a small change,[9] in a diversity. Our data 
are also consistent with the concept that short-term dietary interventions do not overcome 
the dominant inter-individual variation in the intestinal microbiome.[27] 
The increased abundance of butyrate-producing, so-������ ������������, bacterial genera 
such as Bifidobacterium, Lachnospira, Roseburia and Lactobacillus during one or both types 
of omega-3 PUFA intervention is consistent with the mouse literature.[9-10, 25-26, 28-30] 
Whether the relatively small changes in intestinal microbiome that we observed at the end of 
the 8-week intervention period have functional consequences, including an increase in 
luminal SCFA levels, is a question that will require a metabolomic approach, including 
lipidomic profiling. The increase in Roseburia and Lachnospira was only observed during the 
drink intervention. Further studies are required in order to determine what aspect of the drink 
formulation may explain this difference. 
Studies of CRC and colorectal adenoma patients have reported a reduction in OTUs of 
SCFA-producing bacteria compared with healthy controls.[7, 31-33] An increase in SCFA-
producing bacteria such as Bifidobacterium, leading to enhanced mucosal SCFA exposure has 
been suggested to reduce mucosal inflammatory tone.[34] Therefore, our findings are 
compatible with a hypothesis that omega-3 PUFA intake is associated with intestinal 
microbiota changes driving increased luminal SCFA exposure. In future studies, it will be key 
to investigate the effect of omega-3 PUFAs on the colonic metabolome in concert with dietary 
fibre assessment. Consistent with an interaction between omega-3 PUFAs and fibre, Crim et 
al have reported that fish oil and dietary pectin have synergistic anti-neoplastic activity in 
rats.[35]      
We did not observe any relationship between intestinal microbiome changes and RBC 
omega-3 PUFA levels (a measure of systemic omega-3 PUFA exposure). Therefore, we do not 
provide any evidence that �������� ����������������� �� omega-3 PUFAs was modulated by the 
intestinal microbiota in our study. However, mouse studies have demonstrated that 
supplementation with Bifidobacterium breve was associated with increased tissue EPA and 
 15 
 
DHA content, suggesting an influence of intestinal microbiota on tissue fatty acid levels.[36] 
It remains unclear whether RBC omega-3 PUFA levels after oral omega-3 PUFA 
supplementation predict omega-3 PUFA exposure in the gut lumen. In a study of patients 
(n=6) with a permanent ileostomy and minimal terminal ileum removed, less than 1% of the 
total oral omega-3 PUFA dose was recovered in ileal effluent suggesting efficient proximal 
small intestinal absorption.[37] However, the daily dose of EPA and DHA was less than 300 
mg for 4 days only.[37] It remains unclear what the small intestinal and colonic bioavailability 
of omega-� PUFA� �� �� ���� ������ ����� �� ������[5-6]    
A randomized trial of control versus sardine diet (100 g sardines for 5 days per week for 6 
months providing approximately 3 g daily of EPA and DHA combined) in type II diabetics 
reported a significant decrease in F/B ratio in the sardine diet arm compared with 
controls.[38] We did not observe a significant change in the F/B ratio in our study, which may 
be explained by differences in omega-3 PUFA delivery and duration of the intervention.        
Red blood cell fatty acid changes were similar during either the drink or capsule 
intervention with a significant increase in RBC EPA and DHA (and a parallel decrease in AA 
content) consistent with dosing at 4 g per day for 8 weeks.[39] It is not clear why the drink 
intervention was associated with a larger decrease in relative AA content, which led to a 
significantly higher EPA+DHA/AA ratio. We acknowledge that despite daily dose equivalence 
of EPA and DHA between drink and capsule interventions, the omega-3 PUFAs were 
triglyceride and ethyl ester conjugates respectively. In the longest comparative study of 
capsules providing 1.68 g EPA/DHA per day (6 months), the RBC omega-3 index was higher 
after consumption of omega-3 PUFA triglycerides compared with ethyl esters.[40] Our study 
suggests that, at high doses (4 g) over several weeks, possible small differences in intestinal 
bioavailability related to PUFA delivery are not relevant to omega-3 PUFA tissue incorporation 
and subsequent changes in the intestinal microbiota. Further investigation of the effect of the 
other macro- (eg. fibre) and micro-nutrients (eg. vitamin D) in the Smartfish® intervention on 
tissue PUFA incorporation and metabolism is required.  
Smartfish® Remune drinks providing 4 g per day of EPA and DHA combined were well-
tolerated by healthy middle-aged individuals. Treatment-emergent AEs were similar between 
drinks and capsules with a suggestion that upper gastrointestinal symptoms were more 
common during the capsule intervention. An AE occurring during one intervention did not 
consistently predict occurrence during the other intervention. The excellent acceptability and 
 16 
 
tolerability, aligned with good omega-3 PUFA absorption characteristics, mirrors previous 
experience with an earlier version of the Smartfish® drink.[41] The aetiology of the dose-
dependent diarrhoea caused by omega-3 PUFA intake in up to 5-10% of individuals remains 
unclear. We describe, for the first time, that diarrhoea associated with omega-3 PUFA intake 
is not associated with a significant change in intestinal microbiota or predicted by a particular 
baseline intestinal microbiome profile.     
The strengths of this study include the crossover design that allowed a direct comparison 
between two omega-3 PUFA formulations, thus minimizing the effect of inter-individual 
variability in omega-3 PUFA incorporation [42] and intestinal microbiome profile,[43] as well 
as the middle-aged demographic of the study cohort relevant to CRC prevention. A 
methodological weakness was the lack of colorectal tissue in order study the effect of omega-
3 PUFA treatment on the mucosa-associated microbiome. This would be particularly relevant 
if luminal bioavailability of oral omega-3 PUFAs is confirmed to be low and omega-3 PUFA 
���������� �� ������������� ��� �������� ����� ����s from surface and/or shed enterocytes. 
We also did not obtain data on the background diet and dietary omega-3 PUFA intake.  
In summary, we report that a high-dose (4 g daily) of mixed omega-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) 
given for 8 weeks is associated with small changes in the intestinal microbiota that are 
consistent across two different omega-3 PUFA interventions.[9-10, 25-28] The increase in 
density of bacteria known to be butyrate-producers concurs with the existing pre-clinical 
literature and is compatible with the known anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic properties 
of omega-3 PUFAs.
