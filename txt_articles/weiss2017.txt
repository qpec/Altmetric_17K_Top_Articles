Summary Background Pharmacological inhibition of polo-
like kinase 1 (PLK1) represents a new approach for the treat-
ment of solid tumors. This study was aimed at determining the
first cycle dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and related maxi-
mum tolerated dose (MTD) of NMS-1286937, a selective
ATP-competitive PLK1-specific inhibitor. Secondary objec-
tives included evaluation of its safety and pharmacokinetic
(PK) profile in plasma, its antitumor activity, and its ability
to modulate intracellular targets in biopsied tissue. Methods
This was a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial in patients
with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. A treatment cycle
comprised 5 days of oral administration followed by 16 days
of rest, for a total of 21 days (3-week cycle). Results Nineteen
of 21 enrolled patients with confirmed metastatic disease re-
ceived study medication. No DLTs occurred at the first 3 dose
levels (6, 12, and 24 mg/m2/day). At the subsequent dose level
(48 mg/m2/day), 2 of 3 patients developed DLTs. An
intermediate level of 36 mg/m2/day was therefore investigat-
ed. Four patients were treated and two DLTs were observed.
After further cohort expansion, the MTD and recommended
phase II dose (RP2D) were determined to be 24 mg/m2/day.
Disease stabilization, observed in several patients, was the
best treatment response observed. Hematological toxicity
(mostly thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) was the major
DLT. Systemic exposure to NMS-1286937 increased with
dose and was comparable between two cycles of treatment
following oral administration of the drug. Conclusions This
study successfully identified the MTD and DLTs for NMS-
1286937 and characterized its safety profile.

Introduction
Polo-like kinases (PLK) are an evolutionarily conserved fam-
ily of serine/threonine kinases that regulate critical processes
in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Cellular functionality of
the polo gene was first investigated by analyzing the genetic
mutations in Drosophila melanogaster which demonstrated a
phenotype of abnormal mitotic spindle poles [1]. In humans,
five members of the family—PLK1, PLK2, PLK3, PLK4, and
PLK5—have been identified [2], and although a certain de-
gree of homology is observed among the family members,
depletion of PLK1 activity is not rescued by the other
orthologues and is sufficient to trigger mitotic block and apo-
ptosis of tumor cells [3]. PLK1 is indeed a master regulator of
mitosis, being involved in all the mitotic steps from prophase
to cytokinesis [4]. It is ubiquitously expressed in normal

 proliferating tissues and is over-expressed in a wide variety of
human tumors including lung, colon, ovary, breast, gastric
carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, with
several studies correlating over-expression with poor progno-
sis [5–10]. Deregulated PLK1 activity is believed to result in
genetic instability, ultimately leading to oncogenic transfor-
mation [11]. PLK1 is not expressed in differentiated post-
mitotic cells such as neurons, where expression of PLK2
and PLK3 has been described instead [12]. More recent data
indicate a role for PLK1 beyond direct regulation of mitosis,
with involvement in additional important pathways for tumor
development and growth such as the DNA damage response
[13], epithelial mesenchymal transition [14], regulation of an-
drogen receptor (AR) signaling in castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) [15–18], and stabilization of key oncogenes
such as c-Myc and N-Myc [19]. Additional data propose hy-
persensitivity to PLK1 depletion/inhibition in P53(−) and
KRAS mutated tumors [20, 21].
Constitutive in vitro expression of PLK1 in human fibro-
blasts following microinjection of PLK1 mRNA has been
shown to result in oncogenic focus formation, with the trans-
formed cells being capable of forming tumors in nude mice
[22]. Conversely, inhibition of PLK1 expression by small/
short hairpin RNA (shRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, or
small molecule inhibitors results in decreased cell prolifera-
tion in vitro and in vivo [23].
PLK1 is thus a highly attractive target for cancer therapy:
specific inhibition of this kinase results in potent block of
mitosis without direct effects on tubulin, thus potentially
avoiding the classical side-effects of microtubule binding
agents on neurons that results, for example, in peripheral
neuropathy.
A few PLK1 inhibitors have entered clinical phase in recent
years, with BI-2536 and BI-6727 (volasertib) being the two
most widely explored in clinical trials [24]. These two ATP-
competitive compounds are administered intravenously and
inhibit PLK1, with the latter also being a potent inhibitor of
both PLK2 and PLK3 [24, 25]. Both BI-2536 and volasertib
are also known to interact with BET bromodomain proteins
[26]. A small number of cases of partial responses and long-
term stable disease were documented as best efficacy results in
solid tumors with volasertib [27], while safety data reported in
the phase I study in patients with solid tumors revealed grade 3
and 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, observed in 14% of
the patients, as being the main DLTs [27]. Mild QTc prolon-
gation was observed in a number of patients, and grade 3 in
one patient (2%). Furthermore, positive results in a phase II
trial of volasertib in combination with low dose cytarabine in
patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were reported
[28], with a complete response (CR)/CRi (complete response
with incomplete recovery of blood counts) rate of 31% and a
one year overall survival (OS) estimate of 36.8% suggesting
important activity in this hematologic malignancy; however, a
phase III trial in the same setting did not meet its primary
objective response endpoint.
NMS-1286937 is an ATP-competitive, highly potent and
selective inhibitor of PLK1. Preclinical mechanism of action
studies in tumor cells revealed that NMS-1286937 causes mi-
totic cell cycle block, inducing monopolar spindles which
preclude chromosome segregation, followed by apoptosis
[29, 30]. The compound was also tested in vitro on primary
cells from patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leuke-
mia (ALL). NMS-1286937 was effective in vitro in ALL cells
bearing a high Polo-like kinase 1 protein expression, whereas
cells with low expression and normal bone marrow cells were
resistant to the drug [31]. The compound was also highly
active in reducing proliferation in a panel of AML cell lines
and in a number of other leukemic cells. NMS-1286937 has
highly favorable preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and ab-
sorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) pa-
rameters and good oral availability, and exhibits significant
preclinical efficacy both as a single agent and in combination
with standard of care in several human tumor xenografts.
Positive in vivo results were also observed when NMS-
1286937 was used both as a single agent and in combination
in three different AML models (subcutaneously implanted
HL60 and disseminated AML PS and AML NS8) with con-
firmed in vivo mechanism of action [32]. These preclinical
data support the development of NMS-1286937 as a single
agent and in combination therapy regimens for the treatment
of both hematological malignancies (eg, AML and ALL), as
well as solid tumors.
Here we report the results of the first phase I open-label
dose escalation study in adult patients with advanced/
metastatic solid tumors, where we evaluated the dose-
limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the related maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) of NMS-1286937. Secondary objectives includ-
ed definition of the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles
of NMS-1286937, documentation of any antitumor activity
and investigation of the presence, type, and extent of target
modulation by the drug in skin and/or tumor tissue samples
provided by consenting patients.
Patients and Methods
Study design
This phase I, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation trial
included sequential cohorts of adults with advanced/
metastatic tumors and was performed at a single center in
the United States between December 2009 and April 2012.
Signed written informed consent was obtained from each pa-
tient prior to undertaking any trial-related procedure. The
study protocol, amendments to the protocol, and the sample
informed consent file were reviewed and approved by the
Invest New Drugs
 Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the study site. The study
conformed to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines pub-
lished by the International Council for Harmonization (ICH),
ethical principles as set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki
(1996 version), and all applicable local regulatory require-
ments and laws.
All cohorts received repeated cycles of NMS-1286937
orally, with a 3-week treatment cycle consisting of 5 consec-
utive days of NMS-1286937 once daily (Days 1 to 5) followed
by 16 days of rest, for a total of 21 days. Cohorts of at least 3
patients each were allocated to receive progressively higher
dose levels of NMS-1286937 according to a two-stage accel-
erated titration design based on the presence and severity of
NMS-1286937-related toxicity, for a total of 3 cycles. Criteria
for inclusion in and exclusion from the study are listed in
Section 1 of the Supplementary Material. Patients remained
on treatment until disease progression, refusal, withdrawal of
consent, or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity.
Selection of starting dose and treatment duration
Selection of the starting dose in man (6 mg/m2/day) was based
on results in rats and monkeys, with rats being considered the
more sensitive species. Similarly, selection of the 2-week rest
period (resulting in a 3-week treatment cycle) was based on
the recovery from hematological toxicity in animals. The se-
lected starting dose was thus designed to provide adequate
safety margins for the selected patient population.
Study endpoints
The primary endpoints were first-cycle DLTs and related
MTDs. Secondary endpoints included the overall safety pro-
file of NMS-1286937, assessed on the basis of adverse events
(AEs) characterized by type, severity (graded using the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] Version 3.0), timing, and re-
lationship to study therapy and on the basis of laboratory
abnormalities in the first and in subsequent cycles; plasma
concentrations of NMS-1286937 at different times after dos-
ing, with related assessment of Cmax, tmax, t½, and AUCdaily;
objective tumor response in patients with solid tumors and
measurable disease at study entry, as measured using
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
criteria [33]; and changes in Western Blot (WB) and immuno-
histochemistry (IHC): staining of histone H3 phospho-serine
10 (pSer10 Histone H3) and of nucleophosmin phospho-
threonine 199 (pThr199 nucleophosmin) in pre- and post-
treatment skin and tumor biopsies of consenting patients and
phospho serine-46 Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein
(pSer46 TCTP) [34] in pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies
of consenting patients.
Assignment of study participants to treatment groups
and dose escalation modalities
The dose escalation scheme was based on an accelerated study
design, with assignment of dose for the first cycle of a new
patient cohort depending upon whether each patient entered
the study during the early accelerated phase or the latter
standard phase of the trial [35]. In the initial early accelerated
phase of the study, the dose escalation proceeded in 100%
increments. This rapid escalation phase ended when one pa-
tient had experienced a first cycle drug-related DLT or two
patients, at any dose level, had experienced a shift by two
common terminology criteria (CTC) grades versus baseline
of any drug-related toxicity during any cycle of treatment.
The second (latter standard) phase of the study started upon
occurrence of these toxicities, with dose escalation in this
phase proceeding in 50% increments. Available clinical safety
and PK data from all cycles was reviewed prior to escalating
to the next dose level during both escalation phases. Dose
escalations were decided jointly between the investigator
and the sponsor. Any patient not completing the 5-day treat-
ment after receiving at least 80% of the planned dose of NMS-
1286937 in the first cycle was replaced unless non-completion
of the 5-day treatment was due to drug-related toxicities.
Definition of the MTD and DLT
The MTD was defined as the dose level at which none of 6 or
1 of 6 patients experienced a DLT in the first cycle of treat-
ment, with the next higher dose having at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
patients encountering DLT. The MTD was effectively consid-
ered to be the highest dose associated with first cycle DLT in
<33% of patients.
Toxicity was graded according to the NCI CTCAE version
3.0, with DLT being defined in this study as any event ≥ Grade
3 for which the relationship to NMS-1286937 could not be
definitely excluded. Events that can classify a DLT are pro-
vided in Section 2 of the Supplementary Material.
Treatment
The dose level was assigned by the sponsor at the time of
enrollment in the study. The appropriate amount of drug to
be administered was calculated at each cycle based on the
body surface area (BSA) of each individual patient and the
assigned dose level. The dose was rounded to the nearest
5 mg. All patients received their dose of NMS-1286937 to-
gether with a diary, including all the instructions relevant to
study drug administration. Capsules of NMS-1286937 were
administered orally once daily for 5 consecutive days in a 3-
week cycle.
No more than one intra-patient dose de-escalation was
allowed. Any subject experiencing first-cycle DLT was not
Invest New Drugs
 re-exposed to the study drug and was withdrawn from
treatment.
Removal of participants from treatment or assessment
Patients could continue therapy with NMS-1286937 un-
less there was disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
a change in their medical status such that the investiga-
tor felt their safety was compromised or that it was in
their best interest to stop treatment, they withdrew con-
sent, or were lost to follow-up.
Efficacy assessments
Determination of antitumor efficacy was based on objective
tumor assessments performed according to RECIST [31]. In
addition, changes in Western Blot (WB) and immunohisto-
chemical (IHC) staining of pSer10 histone H3 and pThr199
nucleophosmin, and pSer46 TCTP were evaluated in skin and
tumor biopsies of consenting patients. Details pertaining to
these assessments are provided in Section 3 of the
Supplementary Material.
Safety assessments
Severity of AEs was graded according to NCI CTCAE version
3.0. For each event, the highest severity grade attained
was reported. The causal relationship between each AE
and NMS-1286937 was classified according to the fol-
lowing terms: unrelated, possible, probable and definite-
ly related.
Drug concentration measurements
Blood samples were collected for evaluation of the PK
of NMS-1286937 up to 6–8 post-dose (Day 1) and up
to 96 h post-dose (Day 5). All analyses were performed
at Accelera S.r.l, Nerviano, Italy using validated LC/
MS-MS methods as described in Section 4 of the
Supplementary Material.
Statistical and analytical plans
For the evaluation of the primary endpoint (ie, the determina-
tion of the MTD based on first cycle DLTs), all treated patients
were considered, except those who had failed to receive a
complete first cycle of treatment for reasons other than drug-
related toxicities. In this case, additional patients were en-
rolled at the same dose level, in accordance with the dose
escalation scheme. All patients who had received at least
one dose of NMS-1286937 were considered evaluable for
the safety population.
Results
A total of 21 patients were enrolled in the study. Two patients
were enrolled but never treated. One patient (N. 003), with
metastatic prostate cancer, was enrolled in the 6 mg/m2/
day cohort, but was not treated due to brain metastasis,
while another patient (N. 012) with ovarian cancer in
the 48 mg/m2/day cohort was not treated since more
than 4 prior chemotherapy regimens had been adminis-
tered. Of the 21 enrolled patients, 19 patients were treat-
ed according to the assigned dose level and received at least
one dose of NMS-1286937. Demographic and disease char-
acteristics of the patients and their prior anticancer therapies
are summarized in Table 1.
Extent of exposure and treatment modifications
The 19 treated patients received a total of 44 cycles of treat-
ment with a median number of cycles per patient of 2 (range
1–6 cycles). The median treatment duration was 6.1 weeks
(range 1.7–18.1 weeks). The median relative dose intensity
across all dose levels was close to 100% of the intended dose
and ranged from 95.8% to 101.8%. Treatment modifications,
including 1 case of treatment delay and dose reduction, and 3
cases of intra-cycle modifications (ie, dose omission) were
reported for a total of 4 patients.
Dose escalation and first cycle DLTs
Nineteen of the 21 enrolled patients were treated at the
following dose levels: 6 mg/m2/day (3 patients), 12 mg/
m2/day (3 patients), 24 mg/m2/day (6 patients), 36 mg/m2/
day (4 patients), and 48 mg/m2/day (3 patients) (Table 2).
No DLTs occurred at the first three dose levels of 6, 12 and
24 mg/m2/day. At the next dose level of 48 mg/m2/day, 2
out of the 3 treated patients developed a first cycle DLT.
The first patient experienced Grade 4 thrombocytopenia
associated with a Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days
and recovered with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
(G-CSF) support; both events were judged to be drug re-
lated by the investigator. The second patient, who was
under treatment with opiates, which may have contributed
to the event, experienced Grade 3 constipation that was
judged possibly drug related by the investigator. The
MTD was therefore considered to be exceeded and an in-
termediate dose level of 36 mg/m2/day was investigated.
Four patients were treated at this lower dose level and two
DLTs were observed: A Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and a
Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days (recovering to Grade
1 within 10 days with G-CSF support) in one patient, and a
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and a Grade 4 neutropenia lasting
>7 days in a second one. On the basis of these findings, the
recommended dose for Phase II investigations in solid tumors
Invest New Drugs
 was identified as 24 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days every
3 weeks.
Safety results
Eleven of the 19 patients (57.9%) experienced ≥1 drug-related
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), with 36.8% Grade
3–4 TEAEs (Table 3). The most frequent TEAEs (frequency
of ≥10%) of Grade 1–4 were thrombocytopenia (21.1%), hy-
pokalemia, neutropenia (15.8%), anemia, increases in aspar-
tate aminotransferase (AST) levels, hypocalcemia,
hypophosphatemia, leukopenia and nausea (10.5% each).
Frequent Grade 3–4 events included thrombocytopenia and
neutropenia (15.8%), anemia and leucopenia (10.5% each).
Two patients died during the study (ie, within 28 days of
completion of treatment) due to disease progression (one case
each of colon cancer and non-small cell lung cancer

Pharmacokinetic results
Overall, 19 patients were evaluable for pharmacokinetic as-
sessments. The mean PK parameters ± standard deviations
(SD) of NMS-1286937 on Day 1 and Day 5 during Cycle 1
are shown in Table 4. During Cycle 1, both Cmax and AUC0–24
values increased with the administered doses. At doses of 12,
24, and 36 mg/m2, the inter-patient variability of NMS-
1286937 systemic exposure parameters was in the range of
25–60%, with higher inter-patient variability observed at the
lowest and highest doses.
On both Day 1 and Day 5, the maximal concentration of the
compound was achieved between 2 and 4 h post-dosing,
which was independent of the administered dose. On Day 5,
the plasma concentrations of the compound declined with an
apparent terminal half-life in the range of 20–30 h. On Day 5,
the accumulation ratio of Cmax was in the range 1 to 2.1, in
agreement with the terminal half-life of the compound and the
adopted schedule of administration.
In Cycle 2, the pharmacokinetic profile of NMS-1286937
was similar to the first cycle, suggesting a comparable expo-
sure to the compound between the 2 cycles of treatment
(Table 5). In conclusion, the systemic exposure to NMS-
1286937 appeared to increase with dose and to be not depen-
dent on the cycle of treatment.
Efficacy results
Sixteen of the 19 patients (84.2%) enrolled in the study were
evaluable for efficacy. Stable disease at any dose was reported
as best response in 5 out of the 16 evaluable patients (31.2%),
with the remaining 11 patients showing disease progression
(Table 6). The 5 patients with stable disease included two with
colorectal cancer, and one each with pancreatic carcinoma
with a K-RAS mutation, head and neck squamous cell carci-
noma, and basal cell carcinoma. Two patients (treated at 6 and
24 mg/m2/day) showed prolonged stable disease (lasting 15.4
and 18 weeks, respectively).
No patient consented to the collection of tumor biopsy
samples for biomarker evaluation. Three skin biopsy samples
were collected for IHC analysis at the baseline and post-
treatment in Cycle 1 Day 2 (pre-dose before the second treat-
ment), two from patients at the MTD and one from the 36 mg/
m2/day cohort level (Supplementary Table S2). The signifi-
cant interpatient variability observed in the pretreatment skin
samples for the number of positive cells for Ser10 histone H3
and Thr199 nucleophosmin by IHC analysis and the low num-
ber of available biopsies precluded statistical evaluation.
However, skin samples from one patient treated at the MTD
did, in fact, show a slight increase in cells positive for phos-
phorylated ser10 Histone H3 and Thr199 nucleophosmin,
consistent with what is expected following PLK1 inhibition.
Discussion
The present study is the first-in-human study of NMS-
1286937, a highly selective ATP competitive inhibitor of
PLK1, the serine–threonine protein kinase orchestrating cell
cycle progression through mitosis. In this study, performed in
a non-selected solid tumor patient population, 5 dose levels
were studied and systemic exposure to NMS-1286937 ap-
peared to increase with dose. Thrombocytopenia and neutro-
penia were identified as the primary DLTs, consistent with the
expected mechanism of action and results from preclinical
studies with NMS-1286937. These hematological toxicities
were reversible, with recovery usually occurring within

experienced grade 3 constipation, which may have been due
to concomitant treatment with opiates.
No other clinically relevant safety findings emerged with
treatment with NMS-1286937 as a single agent. Other mech-
anism-related, possibly expected events such as gastrointesti-
nal disorders, mucositis, and alopecia were not observed,
confirming that with this schedule, the bone marrow is the
most sensitive target of NMS-1286937 in humans.
Peripheral neuropathy was not observed, differentiating
the mitotic block obtained by PLK1 inhibition from that
obtained with microtubule binding agents that interfere
with neuronal axon transportation, such as the taxanes
and vinca alkaloids [36]. The MTD and RP2D for

 NMS-1286937 were defined as being 24 mg/m2/day, since
no DLTs related to myelosuppression were observed in the 6
patients treated at this dose level. This dose was well tolerated
and could therefore be administered in repeated cycles in pa-
tients with solid tumors.
Hematological DLTs were expected due to the capacity of
PLK inhibitors to induce mitotic cell cycle in rapidly prolifer-
ating blood cells and have also been observed with BI-
2536 and volasertib, the PLK inhibitors most broadly
evaluated to date in clinical trials. In the first time in
man Phase I study of volasertib in solid tumors, for
example, 49% of the patients experienced at least one
drug related dose-limiting AE: anemia, neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, and/or febrile neutropenia (all grades
22%, 15%, 14%, and 8%, respectively) [27].
In this same study of volasertib, stable disease was seen in
40% of the treated patients and 3 partial responses (PR) were
observed. However, 2 out of 3 PRs were obtained at doses of
450 mg and 400 mg, which exceeded the recommended phase
II dose of 300 mg. Dose reduction was then introduced for
these patients starting from cycle 2 due to AE; however, no
data are available on the molecular characterization of the
patient population treated with this drug.
In the present study with NMS-1286937, disease stabiliza-
tion was observed as the best response in 5 out of the 16
evaluable patients (26.3%), while no objective responses were
observed.
A biomarker driven approach with the collection of tumor
samples, as well as skin biopsies, which could serve as surro-
gate tissue, was set up in this phase 1 clinical study based on
the biomarker modulation observed in tumors in the in vivo
preclinical studies of NMS-1286937. No patient consented for
pre/post treatment tumor biopsy and only two skin samples
from patients treated at the MTD (24 mg/m2/day), and one
from a patient treated at 36 mg/m2/day were collected for
IHC studies to follow the changes of pSer10 Histone H3 and
pThr199 Nucleophosmin. No statistically relevant biomarker
increase was observed on-treatment versus baseline. This is in
line with the fact that concentrations were below the threshold
expected to modulate biomarkers in tumor and skin tissue
based on preclinical studies. However, a slight increase of
pSer10 Histone H3 and pThr 199 nucleophosmin positive
cells was observed when comparing pre- and post-treatment
samples in the only patient showing a Cmax of 0.91 μM. The
NMS-1286937 Cmax reached in this patient was compatible
with the plasma concentration in murine tumor models re-
quired to observe marker modulation in vivo in tumors; how-
ever, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding biomarker
modulation induced by NMS-1286937 based on this clinical
study. This approach will be implemented in future studies to
further explore the role of tumor markers to measure therapeu-
tic efficacy.
Future development of NMS-1286937 may envisage alter-
native schedules as well as patient selection with predictive

 biomarkers of efficacy. Several potential preferential sensitiv-
ity contexts are in fact emerging for PLK1 inhibition biology,
including KRAS mutated tumors, AR-dependent CRPC, and
MYC- overexpressing tumors [19]. The scientific ratio-
nale for targeting MYC driven tumors is based on the
ability of PLK1 to bind and phosphorylate the SCFFbw7
ubiquitin ligase, promoting its degradation and leading
to MYC stabilization. MYC-dependent tumors such as
neuroblastoma [37, 38] or lymphoma could thus be ex-
plored to confirm that antimitotic effects of PLK1 inhi-
bition effectively correlate with specific effects on the
MYC pathway, which would be expected to yield addi-
tive or supra-additive effects. Intriguingly, 3 out of 5
instances of stable disease in our study were observed in pa-
tients with KRAS mutant tumors, prompting an interest in
expanding the number of patients with this profile in future
studies with NMS-1286937.
In conclusion, this study successfully identified the safety,
tolerability, and toxicity profile of NMS-1286937 given on a
daily schedule for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks. The
compound has excellent potential for schedule flexibility due
to its oral bioavailability, and alternative regimens will be
tested in selected patient subpopulations to further character-
ize its safety and efficacy profile. Specifically, patients with
hematological malignancies (eg, AML) are a possible target
population for PLK1 inhibition when it is given both as single
agent and in combination with standards of care. The greater
selectivity of NMS-1286937 for PLK1 and its potency,
coupled with its favorable pharmacokinetic properties (eg,
oral bioavailability and shorter half-life) vis-à-vis volasertib,
underscore its potential as a safe and potentially more effective
agent for the treatment of multiple solid tumor types and he-
matological malignancies.
