BACKGROUND: Several observational studies have reported that 
higher visit-to-visit blood pressure variability is a risk factor for cognitive 
impairment and dementia. However, no studies have investigated the 
association of day-to-day blood pressure variability assessed by home 
blood pressure measurement with the development of dementia.
METHODS: A total of 1674 community-dwelling Japanese elderly without 
dementia, ≥60 years of age, were followed up for 5 years (2007–2012). 
Home blood pressure was measured 3 times every morning for a median of 
28 days. Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure variabilities, 
calculated as coefficients of variation (CoV) of home SBP and diastolic 
blood pressure, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 
95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of home blood pressure on the 
development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer 
disease (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause 
dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD. The age- and sex-
adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased 
significantly with increasing CoV levels of home SBP (all P for trend <0.05). 
These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential 
confounding factors, including home SBP
. Compared with subjects in the 
first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP
, the risks of the development of 
all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the 
fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, 
P<0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence 
interval=1.04–7.51, P=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence 
interval=1.31–3.75, P<0.001 for AD). Similar associations were observed for 
CoV levels of home diastolic blood pressure. Meanwhile, home SBP levels 
were significantly associated with the risk of VaD but not with the risks of 
all-cause dementia and AD. There was no interaction between home SBP 
levels and CoV levels of home SBP on the risk of each subtype of dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that increased day-to-day blood 
pressure variability is, independently of average home blood pressure, a 
significant risk factor for the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, 
and AD in the general elderly Japanese population.

B
lood pressure is well known to have short-term 
(over a period of 24 hours), midterm (over a pe-
riod of days), and long-term fluctuations within 
more prolonged periods of change measured in weeks, 
months, seasons, and even years. Such fluctuation of 
blood pressure, or so-called blood pressure variability 
(BPV), is increasingly recognized to play clinically impor-
tant roles in the progression of target-organ damage 
and cardiovascular events independently of absolute 
blood pressure values.1–3
Dementia is a worldwide priority in terms of both 
public health and social care as a result of the mount-
ing burdens it is placing on communities.4 Recently, the 
influence of BPV on cognitive function has attracted 
attention. One cross-sectional study5 and several lon-
gitudinal studies6–9 have reported that increased BPV 
is significantly associated with higher risks of cognitive 
impairment5–8 and dementia.9 However, most of these 
studies were based on visit-to-visit BPV assessed by of-
fice blood pressure over months or years. In contrast, 
only 1 longitudinal study has shown a significant associ-
ation between day-to-day BPV assessed by home blood 
pressure measurements and risk of cognitive impair-
ment,10 and no studies have examined the association 
of day-to-day BPV with the development of dementia 
and its subtypes.
Compared with the measurement of visit-to-visit BPV 
on the basis of office blood pressure measurements, 
measurement of day-to-day BPV with home blood pres-
sure monitoring is more reproducible and has no white 
coat effect,11,12 which enables us to collect more reliable 
information and to optimize the blood pressure man-
agement earlier.13 In addition, several factors such as ar-
terial compliance, use of antihypertensive agents (dos-
ing, adherence, etc), and daily physical activities have 
been shown to contribute to day-to-day BPV, whereas 
little is known about the factors responsible for BPV ob-
served over months or years among office visits. The 
significance of BPV based on office blood pressure mea-
surements at different times of visits is particularly un-
clear.13,14 On the other hand, 24-hour ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring is widely used in clinical practice. 
Short-term BPV within a 24-hour period assessed by 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring mainly reflects 
the influences of central and reflex autonomic modula-
tion. Previous studies using ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring have highlighted that circadian variation 
and short-term BPV can predict cardiovascular events.13 
However, short-term BPV (over a period of 24 hours) 
and long-term BPV are independently associated with 
the development of vascular events13 and cognitive de-
cline.15 In addition, measures of day-to-day BPV can be 
obtained with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 
performed over a 48-hour period (consecutive days).13 
However, this strategy is not always well accepted by 
patients. As an alternative, home blood pressure moni-
toring can be performed under fairly standardized con-
ditions and used to monitor blood pressure change 
over several days. Thus, it would be clinically valuable to 
evaluate the influence of day-to-day BPV as determined 
with home blood pressure monitoring on the incidence 
of dementia. The aim of the present study was thus 
to clarify the association between day-to-day BPV on a 
home blood pressure basis and the risk for the devel-
opment of dementia and its subtypes in a prospective 
study of an elderly Japanese population.
METHODS
Study Population
The Hisayama study, a population-based prospective cohort 
study of cerebro-cardiovascular diseases, has been under-
way in the town of Hisayama, which is located in a suburb 
of Fukuoka City on Kyushu Island in Japan. According to the 
national census and nutrition survey, the age and occupational 
distributions of the Hisayama population have been similar to 
those in Japan as a whole since the 1960s.16 Full community 
surveys of the health status and neurological condition of resi-
dents ≥40 years of age have been repeated every 1 to 2 years 
since 1961.16 In addition, comprehensive surveys of cognitive 
impairment in the elderly, including neuropsychological tests 
such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),17 the 
Hasegawa’s Dementia Scale,18 and the Hasegawa’s Dementia 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This prospective cohort study of a general Japa-
nese population demonstrated a significant inde-
pendent association between increased day-to-day 
blood pressure variability measured with home 
blood pressure monitoring and risk for the devel-
opment of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia, 
and Alzheimer disease.
• Both higher day-to-day blood pressure variabil-
ity and hypertension were independently associ-
ated with the risk of vascular dementia, whereas 
the risk of Alzheimer disease was increased sig-
nificantly in subjects with higher blood pressure 
variability regardless of absolute blood pressure 
values.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The findings of this study indicate that the mea-
surement of day-to-day blood pressure variability 
with home blood pressure monitoring may be use-
ful to assess future risk of dementia, regardless of 
its subtype.
• Further studies are needed to clarify whether day-
to-day blood pressure variability is an indicator of 
future dementia or an interventional target for the 
prevention of dementia.

Scale revised version,18 were also conducted in 1985, 1992, 
1998, 2005 to 2006, and 2012 to 2013, and we have also 
performed a follow-up survey of dementia in our community 
since 1985.19
In 2007 and 2008, a screening survey for the present study 
was performed in the town. A total of 1996 residents ≥60 
years of age (86.3% of the total population of this age group) 
consented to participate in the examination and underwent 
the home blood pressure measurement. Among these, 1740 
residents measured their home blood pressure for ≥3 days. 
We identified and excluded 66 subjects who had already 
developed dementia at baseline by using the data from the 
2005 to 2006 prevalence survey and a follow-up survey from 
2005 to 2007. After exclusion of these cases with dementia, 
a total of 1674 subjects (738 men and 936 women) were 
enrolled in the present study. This study was approved by 
the Kyushu University Institutional Review Board for Clinical 
Research, and written informed consent was obtained from 
all participants.
Home Blood Pressure Measurements and 
Day-To-Day Variability Assessment
Physicians or public health nurses instructed the subjects on 
the appropriate way to measure home blood pressure. The 
subjects were instructed to measure their home blood pres-
sure 3 times after >5 minutes of rest in the sitting position 
every morning, within 1 hour after getting up, and before 
breakfast and taking medication for 28 days with a validated 
digital electronic device (HEM-7080IC; Omron Healthcare, 
Kyoto, Japan) based on the cuff oscillometric method. The 
HEM-7080IC features memory storage for up to 350 blood 
pressure measurements and can extract these data for analy-
sis. The mean of the 3 measurements was used as the value 
on each day, and all available daily averages were used in the 
present analysis. Home blood pressure was measured for a 
median of 28 days (range, 3–28 days), and mean home blood 
pressure and its SD were calculated from all the obtained 
measurements. Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood 
pressure variabilities were defined using the coefficient of 
variation (CoV) of home SBP and diastolic blood pressure. The 
CoV values (percent) were calculated with the formula (SD/
mean blood pressure×100) and were categorized into quar-
tiles as follows: SBP: quartile 1, ≤5.07%; quartile 2, 5.08% to 
6.21%; quartile 3, 6.22% to 7.59%; and quartile 4, ≥7.60%; 
and diastolic blood pressure: quartile 1, ≤4.83%; quartile 2, 
4.84% to 5.99%; quartile 3, 6.00% to 7.60%; and quar-
tile 4, ≥7.61%. We considered other methods of variability, 
namely the SD, the maximum and minimum difference, the 
average real variability (ARV), and the variability independent 
of the mean (VIM). The ARV is computed as the average of 
absolute differences between consecutive day blood pressure 
measurements, and the VIM is calculated as the SD divided by 
the mean to the power x, which is obtained by fitting a curve 
through a plot of SD against mean blood pressure level.
Other Risk Factors
At the baseline examination, each subject was asked to 
complete a self-administered questionnaire covering educa-
tional status, medical history, treatments of hypertension and 
diabetes mellitus, smoking habits, alcohol intake, and physical 
activity. A low education level was defined as ≤9 years of for-
mal education. History of cardiovascular disease was defined 
as any preexisting event of stroke or coronary heart disease, 
including myocardial infarction and coronary intervention. All 
cardiovascular events were adjudicated on the basis of physical 
examinations and a review of all available clinical information, 
including medical records and imaging. Plasma glucose lev-
els were measured by the glucose oxidase method. Diabetes 
mellitus was determined by medical history, plasma glucose 
levels (fasting glucose level ≥7.0 mmol/L or postprandial glu-
cose level ≥11.1 mmol/L), or a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test 
using the 1998 World Health Organization criteria and/or by 
the use of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. Serum total 
cholesterol levels were measured enzymatically. Body height 
and weight were measured in light clothing without shoes, 
and body mass index was calculated (kilograms per meter 
squared). ECG abnormalities were defined as left ventricular 
hypertrophy (Minnesota Code 3-1), ST depression (4-1, 2, 3), 
or atrial fibrillation (8-3). Smoking habits and alcohol intake 
were classified as either current use or not. Subjects engaging 
in sports at least 3 times a week during their leisure time were 
defined as the regular exercise group.
Follow-Up Survey
The subjects were followed up prospectively from June 
2007 to November 2012 (median, 5.3 years). Details of 
the follow-up survey on dementia were published previ-
ously.20,21 In brief, information about new events, including 
stroke and dementia, was collected through a daily monitor-
ing system established by the study team, local physicians, 
and members of the town’s Health and Welfare Office. In 
this system, the physicians in the study team visited clinics, 
hospitals, and the town’s office regularly to collect informa-
tion on events of stroke and dementia, including suspected 
cases. Regular health examinations, including physical and 
neurological examinations, were also repeated every year to 
obtain information on new events of stroke and dementia 
missed by the monitoring system. Health information was 
checked annually by letter or telephone for any subjects who 
did not undergo regular examination or who had moved 
away from town. In addition, comprehensive assessment of 
cognitive function, including neuropsychological tests such 
as the MMSE17 and the Hasegawa’s Dementia Scale revised 
version18 were conducted in 2005 to 2006 and 2012 to 2013 
to precisely detect dementia cases to the greatest extent 
possible. When a subject was suspected of having new neu-
rological symptoms, including cognitive impairment, he/she 
was carefully evaluated by the study team. This team, which 
consisted of stroke physicians and psychiatrists, conducted 
various investigations, including physical and neurological 
examinations, interviews of the family and attending physi-
cian, and a review of the clinical records. In addition, when 
a subject died, we reviewed all the available clinical infor-
mation, interviewed the attending physician and the family 
of the deceased, and tried to obtain permission for autopsy 
from the family. During the follow-up period, 128 subjects 
died, of whom 74 underwent brain examination at autopsy. 
Except for the deceased individuals, no subject was lost to 
follow-up through November 2012.

Diagnosis of Dementia
The guidelines of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised were used to define 
the diagnosis of dementia.22 The criteria of the National 
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke–Association 
International pour la Recherche et l’Enseignement en 
Neurosciences were used to make a diagnosis of vascular 
dementia (VaD),23 and the criteria of the National Institute of 
Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and 
the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association 
were used to define subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD).24 
Every dementia case was adjudicated by expert stroke physi-
cians and psychiatrists. The diagnosis of possible or probable 
dementia subtypes was based on clinical information and 
morphological examination from neuroimagings. Definite 
dementia subtypes were also decided on the basis of clinical 
and neuropathological information in subjects with demen-
tia who underwent autopsy. The diagnostic procedure for 
autopsy cases was reported previously.25
Statistical Analysis
The trends in mean values or frequencies of risk factors 
for the CoV quartiles of home blood pressure were tested 
with linear or logistic regression analysis, respectively. The 
cumulative incidences of dementia and its subtypes were 
estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the dif-
ferences among the CoV levels were tested with a Cox 
proportional hazards model. The annual incidences of 
dementia and its subtypes were calculated by a person-
year method. The hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) of the BPV for the development of 
dementia were estimated with the Cox proportional haz-
ards model. The proportional hazards assumption was 
checked graphically with the log cumulative hazard plot 
for outcomes according to the levels of BPV. The trends 
in risk of dementia and its subtypes across BPV levels of a 
categorical variable assigned ordered natural numbers (ie, 
1, 2, 3, and 4) were tested with the Cox proportional haz-
ards model. The heterogeneity in the association between 
subgroups was tested by adding multiplicative interaction 
terms to the relevant Cox model. Sensitivity analyses were 
examined with other methods of variability such as the SD, 
maximum and minimum difference, ARV, and VIM. We also 
conducted another sensitivity analysis among the subjects 
with available MMSE data in 2005 to 2006. A 2-sided value 
of P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant in 
all analyses. All statistical analyses were performed with the 
SAS statistical software program, version 9.3 (SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of the study population ac-
cording to the CoV levels of home SBP are summarized 
in Table 1. The mean age and home SBP and the fre-
quencies of women, low education, and use of anti-
hypertensive agents increased significantly with higher 
CoV levels of home SBP
, whereas the frequency of reg-
ular exercise decreased significantly with higher CoV 
levels of home SBP
.
During the 5-year follow-up period, 194 subjects 
(72 men and 122 women) developed all-cause demen-
tia: 183 underwent evaluation with brain imaging, 21 
received a brain autopsy, and in 20 cases both were 
performed. Thus, 184 subjects in all (94.8%) had some 
kind of morphological examination. Among dementia 
cases, 7 cases were a mixed type of VaD and AD and

counted as events in the analysis for each subtype. Tak-
ing these results together, 47 subjects experienced VaD 
and 134 experienced AD. Figure 1 demonstrates the 
unadjusted cumulative incidences of all-cause dementia 
and its subtypes according to quartiles of CoV levels of 
home SBP
. The incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, 
and AD were significantly higher among the subjects 
in the fourth quartile of CoV levels of home SBP com-
pared with the first quartile.
Table 2 shows unadjusted incidences and the es-
timated HRs and 95% CIs for the development of 
dementia and its subtypes according to CoV levels of 
home SBP. The age- and sex-adjusted HRs of dementia 
and its subtypes increased significantly with increas-
ing CoV levels of home SBP (P for trend <0.001 for 
all-cause dementia; P=0.01 for VaD; and P<0.001 for 
AD). After adjustment for age, sex, low education, 
use of antihypertensive agents, ECG abnormalities, 
diabetes mellitus, serum total cholesterol, body mass 
index, history of cardiovascular disease, smoking hab-
its, alcohol intake, and regular exercise, the risk of all-
cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased significantly 
with increasing CoV levels of home SBP. These associa-
tions were unchanged even after adjustment for the 
mean values of home SBP for 4 weeks in addition to 
the above-mentioned confounding factors: compared 
with those in the first quartile of CoV levels of home 
SBP, the multivariable-adjusted HRs of all-cause de-
mentia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in sub-
jects in the fourth quartile (HR=2.27, 95% CI=1.45–
3.55, P<0.001 for all-cause dementia; HR=2.79, 95% 
CI=1.04–7.51, P=0.03 for VaD; and HR=2.22, 95% 
CI=1.31–3.75, P<0.001 for AD). When we conducted 
analyses using the CoV levels of home diastolic blood 
pressure, the significant associations with the risks of 
all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were even stronger 
than those using the CoV levels of home SBP (Table 
I in the online-only Data Supplement). Moreover, we 
considered other methods of variability, namely SD, 
maximum and minimum difference, ARV, and VIM. 
Similarly significant associations were observed in 
these analyses, except for the association between 
BPV defined by ARV and VIM with risk of VaD (Table 
II in the online-only Data Supplement). On the other 
hand, when we used the mean SBP levels (Table III 
in the online-only Data Supplement), the risk of VaD 
increased significantly with increasing levels of mean 
SBP (P for trend=0.03), whereas no clear associations 
were observed for all-cause dementia and AD (Table IV 
in the online-only Data Supplement).
Last, we estimated the combined influences of 
home SBP levels and CoV levels of home SBP on the 
risk of VaD and AD because different blood pressure–
related pathological processes might be involved in 
the development of VaD and AD (Figure 2). We divid-
ed the subjects into 4 groups according to the status 
of hypertension based on home SBP values (SBP ≥135 
mm Hg and/or the use of antihypertensive agents 
versus others) and the CoV values of home SBP (the 
fourth quartile [≥7.60%] versus others [<7.60%]). 
When subjects with home SBP levels <135 mm Hg and 
a CoV of home SBP <7.60% were used as a reference 
group, the risk of VaD increased significantly in sub-
jects with home SBP ≥135 mm Hg or the use of anti-
hypertensive agents and a CoV of home SBP ≥7.60% 
(HR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.10–10.74; P<0.05), whereas the 
risk of AD more than doubled in subjects with a CoV of 
home SBP ≥7.60% regardless of the home SBP values. 
There was no interaction between home SBP levels 
and CoV levels of home SBP on the risk of each sub-

type of dementia (AD: P for heterogeneity=0.62; VaD: 
P for heterogeneity=0.90). In the sensitivity analysis, 
we used the median values of home SBP (137 mm Hg 
or not) and CoV levels of home SBP (6.20% or not) as 
cutoff values and found no significant interaction be-
tween mean home SBP and CoV category on the risk 
of all-cause dementia and VaD (P for interaction=0.15 
and 0.51, respectively) but a marginally significant in-
teraction on the risk of AD (P for interaction=0.06). 
In the subgroup analysis of the status of antihyper-
tensive agent use, there was no significant interaction 
in subjects not taking antihypertensive agents (P for 
interaction=0.23), whereas a significant interaction 
was observed in those taking antihypertensive agents 
(P for interaction=0.048). In the latter, subjects with 
both reduced home SBP and higher CoV were likely to 
have greater risk of incident AD.
There was no evidence of heterogeneity in these as-
sociations of day-to-day BPV with the risk of dementia 
among the subgroups of subjects with various poten-
tial risk factors such as sex, diabetes mellitus, use of 
antihypertensive agents, and smoking habits (all P for 
heterogeneity >0.10; Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
DISCUSSION
The present study clearly demonstrated that increased 
day-to-day BPV by self-home measurements was sig-
nificantly associated with the development of all-cause 
dementia, VaD, and AD even after adjustment for 
blood pressure values and other potential dementia 
risk factors. In addition, the risk of VaD increased sig-
nificantly in subjects with both higher day-to-day BPV 
and home systolic hypertension compared with those 
with lower BPV and normotension, whereas the risk 
of AD increased significantly in subjects with higher 
BPV regardless of the home SBP values. These findings 
demonstrate that BPV is an important indicator for the 
development of dementia or a possible interventional 
target against dementia.
Several observational studies have demonstrated the 
association between BPV levels and cognitive impair-
ment or dementia. However, the findings in most stud-
ies are based on visit-to-visit BPV measured by office 
blood pressures. Some studies have shown that higher 
visit-to-visit BPV assessed by office blood pressure was 
significantly associated with cognitive impairment.5–8

sociation between BPV and the risk of dementia and 
reported that increased visit-to-visit systolic BPV evalu-
ated by office blood pressure was a significant risk fac-
tor for the development of all-cause dementia and AD 
but not VaD, probably because of the small number of 
VaD cases.9 Only 1 study, the Ohasama Study, has in-
vestigated the influence of day-to-day BPV measured 
on a home blood pressure basis on cognitive impair-
ment; in that report, subjects with an increased day-to-
day systolic BPV exhibited an increased risk of cognitive 
impairment.10 To the best of our knowledge, the pres-
ent study provides the first prospective evidence that 
an increased day-to-day BPV assessed by home blood 
pressure measurement is associated with the develop-
ment of dementia and its subtypes in an elderly general 
population.
The present study demonstrated that both higher 
day-to-day BPV and SBP values were significantly as-
sociated with VaD. Elevated SBP is widely known to 
be a risk factor for small vessel disease, stroke, and 
VaD.20,26,27 Some observational studies have also re-
ported that elevated visit-to-visit BPV was a significant 
risk factor for the development of stroke, white matter 
hyperintensities,28,29 cerebral microbleeds,30 and corti-
cal microinfarcts.6 Hemodynamic instability via elevat-
ed BPV may increase shear stress, which could directly 
lead to small vessel disease and cerebral hypoperfu-
sion28 and subsequent neuronal cell injury.6,27,29 In ad-
dition, increased BPV may be a marker of arterial stiff-
ness, which is associated with increased risk of VaD, 
because arterial stiffness can magnify random blood 
pressure changes.30
On the other hand, the risk of AD was increased 
significantly with higher BPV in this study, regardless 
of absolute blood pressure values, which were not as-
sociated with the development of AD.20 This finding 
may reflect autonomic dysfunction caused by changes 
in the central nervous system structure in individuals 
with prodromal AD, rather than direct shear stress on 
the cerebral arteries. Because the structure of the cen-
tral nervous system has been shown to play a role in 
regulating the autonomic nervous system, it has been 
hypothesized that the central cholinergic dysfunction 
observed in AD could lead to autonomic dysfunc-
tion.31,32 Meanwhile, high BPV without hypertension 
might increase the risk of hypoperfusion, which may 
be associated with increasing risk of cognitive decline 
and dementia via deteriorating neuronal damage.33,34 
From the above, BPV may be a causative factor of the 
alterations in brain structure and function, which in 
turn might lead to the development of dementia, espe-
cially VaD. On the other hand, BPV may be a marker of 
neurodegeneration, which has specific findings in AD, 
but the exact mechanisms responsible for these asso-
ciations are unclear. Any clinical trial in which BPV was 
modified (eg, a trial using long-lasting antihyperten-
sive agents) could help to clarify these mechanisms.35 
Evidence is accumulating that diuretics and calcium 
channel blockers are associated with lower levels of 
BPV compared with other antihypertensive classes.36,37 
However, the magnitude of the difference in BPV be-
tween classes was relatively low in these reports, and 
few clinical trials have addressed the class effects of 
antihypertensive agents on cardiovascular disease and 
cognitive function. Further studies are needed to eluci-
date the pathogenesis of increased BPV in the develop-
ment of dementia and its subtypes.
The strengths of our study include its longitudinal 
community-based design, high participation rate in 
the baseline examination, perfect follow-up of sub-

jects, and accuracy of diagnosis of dementia. However, 
some limitations of our study should be discussed. 
First, we could not obtain information on change of 
blood pressure control and other risk factors resulting 
from modifications in lifestyle or medication during 
the follow-up. The lack of this information may have 
reduced the accuracy of our findings to some extent. 
Second, the number of events was insufficient for a 
more detailed analysis. Third, there could be residual 
confounding caused by unmeasured factors such as 
poor adherence to an antihypertensive regimen, inad-
equate blood pressure control, mental/physical stress, 
and sleep deprivation.38,39 Poor adherence to hyperten-
sion treatment and poor blood pressure control might 
have played particularly prominent roles in the elevated 
day-to-day BPV. The present study revealed that sub-
jects who had both reduced home SBP and higher CoV 
were likely to have greater risk of incident AD among 
those taking antihypertensive agents. This finding may 
reflect the influence of hypotension and subsequent 
hypoperfusion on the cognitive dysfunction among 
subjects with intensive blood pressure lowering and 
greater CoV. Fourth, data on neuropsychological tests 
were not available for all participants at baseline. 
Among the 1674 subjects, 1030 underwent the MMSE 
in 2005 to 2006. However, when the analysis was re-
stricted to subjects with available MMSE data at base-
line (Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement), the 
associations between the CoV of SBP/mean SBP and 
risk of dementia and its subtypes remained significant 
even after adjustment for MMSE in addition to the po-
tential confounding covariates (Tables IV and VII in the 
online-only Data Supplement). In addition, sensitivity 
analyses after the exclusion of subjects who developed 
dementia during the initial 2 years of follow-up did 
not make any material difference in the findings (P for 
trend=0.006 for all-cause dementia; P=0.18 for VaD; 
P=0.01 for AD). These data suggest that the possibil-
ity of prodromal dementia cases at baseline was rela-
tively low, and this limitation might not have exerted a 
meaningful influence on the results of our study. Fifth, 
the influence of psychoactive medications on the find-
ings could not be assessed sufficiently. However, only 
1.3% of subjects (n=22) took any antidepressants in 
this study, and the significant associations between 
BPV and the risk of dementia were substantially un-
changed after additional adjustment for the use of an-
tidepressants (data not shown). Last, the present study 
could not clearly distinguish the influence of BPV from 
that of high excursion on the risk of dementia. Nev-
ertheless, there were significant associations of VIM, 
which is an indicator of BPV independently of BP level, 
with the risk of dementia. These findings may suggest 
that higher BPV itself is associated with greater risk of 
dementia, regardless of the presence or absence of 
high or low BP levels, such as high excursion.
CONCLUSIONS
The present study demonstrated that an increased 
day-to-day BPV on a home blood pressure basis was 
significantly associated with the development of all-
cause dementia, VaD, and AD, regardless of average 
home blood pressure. Moreover, both higher day-to-
day BPV and hypertension were significantly associated 
with the risk of VaD, whereas the risk of AD increased 
significantly in subjects with higher BPV regardless of 
absolute blood pressure values. These findings raise the 
possibility that the measurement of day-to-day BPV on 
a home blood pressure basis would be useful for assess-
ing future risk of dementia and elucidating blood pres-
sure–related pathological processes in each dementia 
subtype. However, further investigations are required to 
clarify whether day-to-day BPV is an indicator of future 
dementia or an interventional target for the prevention 
of dementia.
