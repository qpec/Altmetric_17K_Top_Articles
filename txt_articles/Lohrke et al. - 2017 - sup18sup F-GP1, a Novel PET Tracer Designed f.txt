Thromboembolic diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke,
transient ischemic attacks, and pulmonary embolism are major
causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
(GPIIb/IIIa) is the key receptor involved in platelet aggregation and is a
validated target for therapeutic approaches and diagnostic imaging.
The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a specific
small-molecule tracer for PET imaging that binds with high affinity to
GPIIb/IIIa receptors and has suitable pharmacokinetic properties to
overcome limitations of previous approaches. Methods: Binding of
18F-GP1 to GPIIb/IIIa receptors was investigated in competition bind-
ing assays and autoradiography using a fresh cardiac thrombus from
an explanted human heart. The clot-to-blood ratio for 18F-GP1 was
investigated by an in vitro blood flow model. Biodistribution and
thrombus detection was investigated in cynomolgus monkeys after
insertion of a roughened catheter into either the vena cava or the
aorta. Results: 18F-GP1 is an 18F-labeled small molecule for PET
imaging of thrombi. The half maximal inhibitory concentration of
18F-GP1 to GPIIb/IIIa was 20 nM. 18F-GP1 bound to thrombi with a
mean clot-to-blood ratio of 95. Binding was specific and can be dis-
placed by excess nonradioactive derivative. Binding was not affected
by anticoagulants such as aspirin or heparin. 18F-GP1 showed rapid
blood clearance and a low background after intravenous injection in
cynomolgus monkeys. Small arterial, venous thrombi, thrombotic de-
positions on damaged endothelial surface, and small cerebral emboli
were detected in vivo by PET imaging. Conclusions: 18F-GP1 binds
specifically with high affinity to the GPIIb/IIIa receptor involved in
platelet aggregation. Because of its favorable preclinical characteris-
tics, 18F-GP1 is currently being investigated in a human clinical study.

Venous and arterial thrombi play an important role in various
vascular pathologies such as myocardial infarction, stroke, transient
ischemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary em-
bolism (PE) (1). These thromboembolic diseases are a major cause
of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently available diagnos-
tic techniques of thrombus imaging rely on different modalities
depending on the vascular territory. For example, ultrasound is used
for detection of DVT (2) and carotid stenosis (3), transesophageal
echocardiography and contrast-enhanced MRI are used for cardiac
chamber clots (4), and contrast medium–enhanced CT pulmonary an-
giography has become the gold standard for the detection of PE (5,6).
Limitations remain in the tests to diagnose venous clots in DVT
and PE; an agent that could visualize both would be valuable (7). In
addition, standard imaging modalities generally do not allow for
reliable discrimination between fresh unstable thrombi and chronic
organized thrombi. Imaging of DVT with ultrasound is limited to
proximal large vein disease and is unable to distinguish active
thrombotic processes in the context of recurrent disease, nor does
it have high sensitivity in distal or small vessel disease (8). CT
pulmonary angiography has demonstrated acceptable sensitivity
for PE, although the sensitivity decreases in the acute setting and
as the location of the PE becomes more distal (9). Underdiagnosis of
PE remains a problem as evidenced by the fact that approximately
30% of hospital deaths are complicated by unsuspected PE (10).
As a result of arterial thrombi, every year worldwide about 33
million patients experience a new or a recurrent stroke. A highly sen-
sitive molecular imaging approach could potentially identify activated
platelets in the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, a harbinger of
thromboembolic events. Current imaging modalities rely on structural
characteristics, such as vascular flow impairment, and do not address
the critical molecular components of the thrombus.
To overcome these diagnostic limitations, new molecular targets
and imaging approaches need to be explored. The glycoprotein IIb/
IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) receptor has historically represented an interest-
ing target for drug development because it is a key player in the
thrombus formation. Activated platelets express a high number of
this receptor (40,000–80,000/platelet) (11). GPIIb/IIIa is a member
of the integrin family of cell surface proteins and also known as
aIIbb3. It undergoes allosteric activation on stimulation of the plate-
let by a variety of agents (e.g., thrombin, adenosine diphosphate,
thromboxane). In a growing thrombus, the key step of platelet ag-
gregation is characterized by the binding of activated GPIIb/IIIa to
blood fibrinogen domains containing the arginine-glycine-aspartic
acid (RGD) motif, which results in crosslinking. The design and
development of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors has attracted a con-
siderable amount of interest in pharmacologic research with respect
to antiplatelet and antithrombotic activity (12–17). GPIIb/IIIa an-
tagonists are commercially available, for example, abciximab (Reo-
Pro, Centocor; Eli Lilly), eptifibatide (Integrilin; GlaxoSmithKline),
and tirofiban (Aggrastat; Correvio International Sarl). Tirofiban and
eptifibatide are both synthetic RGD peptidomimetics.
Several radiotracer-based diagnostic approaches have been ex-
plored previously including targeting of GPIIb/IIIa (18). For example,

 99mTc-labeled peptide apcitide (99mTc-Acutect; Diatide, Inc.) (19)
contains an RGD-binding motif and was developed as a SPECT tracer
for the detection of DVT. It received Food and Drug Administration
approval for this indication but was later abandoned. 99mTc-Fab
against D-Dimer progressed to phase 2 (20,21), and preclinical studies
with 64Cu-labeled peptides binding to fibrin have recently been de-
scribed (22). The main limitations of agents previously investigated in
the clinic were low target-to-background ratios, slow clearance, and
inability to distinguish acute versus chronic disease (18).
The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a novel
small molecule for thrombus PET imaging that has a high affinity
to GPIIb/IIIa receptors as well as low background and rapid blood
clearance. The preclinical results from an 18F-labeled fiban-class
ligand called 18F-GP1 are presented here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis of 18F-GP1
18F-GP1 was synthesized by nucleophilic radiofluorination starting
from the protected tosylate precursor. The radiolabel was introduced
directly before deprotection of the precursor molecule and subsequent
purification (Fig. 1).
In Vitro Characterization of 19F-GP1 and 18F-GP1
GPIIb/IIIa Binding Assay. The half maximal inhibitory concentra-
tion (IC50) value of the nonradioactive 19F-GP1 was determined by an
in vitro competition assay using microtiter plates coated 48 h with
purified human GPIIb/IIIa (5 mg/mL; Enzyme Research Laboratories)
in phosphate-buffered saline. The nonspecific antibody binding sites
were blocked (Roti-Block; Roth). The plates were incubated with
30 nM 3H-elarofiban (289 GBq/mmol; Bayer Isotope Chemistry)
and a dilution series of 19F-GP1 ranging from 0.1 to 2,000 nM in
quadruplicate. After 60-min incubation, the plates were washed 3
times with 200 mL of phosphate-buffered saline/well. The wells were
filled with 140 mL of scintillation cocktail (Microscint40; Perkin-
Elmer). After being shaken for 15 min, plates were measured using
a TopCount-NXTv2.13 (Perkin-Elmer). The resulting IC50 value rep-
resents the mean of 3 independent assays. The platelet aggregation
assay was performed as described previously (23). Human platelet-
rich plasma was investigated after stimulus of adenosine diphosphate
and platelet clumping recorded as a dynamic measure.
Autoradiography of Explanted Human Thrombus. Binding of 18F-GP1 to a
human thrombus was investigated by autoradiography on a cardiac thrombus
from an explanted human heart (gift from the Herz- und Diabeteszentrum,
Bad Oeynhausen, Germany). The fresh thrombus from the right ventricle was
embedded in Tissue-Tek, and 18-mm cryosections were incubated
with 18F-GP1 (50 Bq/mL in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-etha-
nesulfonic acid [HEPES]), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 mL
per slice), for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed 3 times with HEPES,
and left over night for exposure on BAS-SR Imaging plates (Fuji).
A competition experiment was performed by adding an excess of
tirofiban (0.5 mg/mL; Sigma) to the 18F-GP1 solution. CD41 (GPIIb) staining
was performed with the anti-CD41 antibody from Abcam (ab11024) with the
AP-fast red detection system.
In Vitro Blood Flow Model. The binding of 18F-GP1 to thrombi was
investigated in an in vitro blood flow model, modified from the method
described by Sukavaneshvar (24). An open tube set consisting of tygon-
tubes (R-1000; inner diameter, 3.2 mm), an open reservoir, and a cham-
ber made of a piece of polyethylene tube (PE160p; Intramedic) was used.
The chamber contained a loop with a roughened nylon fishing line for
thrombus formation (thrombogenic surface prepared with sandpaper). A
peristaltic pump was used for blood circulation. The flow in the middle of
the thrombus chamber was adjusted to 70–90 cm per second, monitored
by an ultrasound-Doppler measurement. Ten milliliters of fresh blood
were taken from a volunteer using citrate tubes (S-Monovette; Sarstedt)
and immediately laid into an incubator at a temperature of 37�C (mini-
Therm; Heraeus). The thrombus formation was initiated by the addition
of 0.75 mL of a 2% CaCl2 solution in the 15-mL tube set (final concen-
tration, 10 mM CaCl2). After 7 min of thrombus formation, 18F-GP1
(0.5–1.0 MBq) was added. The recalcified blood and ligand were circu-
lated for another 3 min (tracer incubation time). After 10 min the pump
was stopped, and aliquots were taken and measured in a g-counter (Wiz-
ard3; Perkin-Elmer). The thrombus was removed together with the
roughened thread from the thrombus chamber, and both were rinsed with
saline, measured in a g-counter, dried, and weighed. In some studies, the
calcified blood was exchanged with buffer or fresh blood after 3 min of
tracer incubation to simulate tracer washout conditions.
The impact of anticoagulants on 18F-GP1 thrombus binding was in-
vestigated with blood from a donor, who had taken 600 mg of acetylsa-
licylic acid (aspirin) 24 h before investigation by the in vitro thrombus
model described above. In another experiment, the blood of a donor was
collected in tubes prepared with heparin (2 I.E./mL of blood). 99mTc-
labeled apcitide (99mTc-Acutect) (19) was also investigated in this model
for comparison. From each individual blood donor, multiple independent
studies were performed. Studies in which clots had a weight of more than
0.1 mg were used for the calculation of clot-to-blood ratios.
In Vitro PET Study. The in vitro blood thrombus model described
above was combined with a PET camera (Inveon PET/CT; Siemens) to
investigate the capability to image 18F-GP1 thrombus binding. The part of
the tube set that contained the thrombus was placed inside the PET
camera. The thrombus was imaged continuously from the addition of
the tracer up to 60 min after injection. To simulate tracer washout con-
ditions, 3 min after tracer incubation the blood was exchanged with new
citrated blood after 10 min. In 1 set of experiments, excess nonradioactive
19F-GP1 (2.8 mM) was added after 30 min to study displacement.
PET Imaging Studies in Cynomolgus Monkeys
The animals were handled in compliance with German animal
welfare legislation, and the experiments were performed with the approval
of the state animal welfare committee. In vivo binding studies were
performed in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca
fascicularis, female, R.C. Hartelust BV,
n 5 3). Before interventions, the animals were
anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of a
mixture of xylazin (0.12 mL/kg; Rompun [Bayer
Healthcare]) and ketamine (0.12 mL/kg; Ketavet
[Pfizer]). Buprenorphine (6 mg/kg) was ad-
ministered intramuscularly as analgesia.
A roughened polyethylene tube was ad-
vanced into either the thoracic aorta via the
carotid artery or the vena cava via the femoral
vein 30 min before tracer administration. The
animals were placed inside the PET camera
(Inveon PET/CT; Siemens) and 25 MBq/
FIGURE 1.
Radiosynthesis of 18F-GP1 was performed starting from Boc-protected tosylate precur-
sor (GP1 precursor). A 2-step synthesis followed by purification afforded 1.8–3.5 GBq of 18F-GP1 (yield,
39% ± 4% decay corrected; radiochemical purity . 99%) in 81–84 min overall preparation time (n 5 3).

 animal of 18F-GP1 were administered intravenously. Dynamic PET
images of the thorax were acquired from 0 to 60 min after injection.
Subsequently, static images of the brain and the lower abdomen were
acquired for 10 min. After the PET data acquisition was finished, the
catheter was removed and the thrombus was weighed and counted in
the g-counter. The animals were sacrificed by phenobarbital treatment
before recovery from anesthesia. For organ distribution, parts of all
important organs (liver, kidney, lung, spleen) and body fluids (blood,
gall, urine) were removed and weighed and the activity determined
with a g-counter. PET data were reconstructed using the 2-dimensional
ordered-subset expectation maximization algorithm and analyzed
with the software package provided by the scanner manufacturer.
A 3-dimensional volume of interest was manually drawn for quan-
tification of uptake and kinetic analyses.
RESULTS
In Vitro Characterization of 19F-GP1 and 18F-GP1
19F-GP1 bound to purified human GPIIb/IIIa receptor with an IC50
value of 20 nM in a competition assay against 3H-elarofiban (Fig.
2A). An IC50 of 19 nM was measured for elarofiban in the same
assay. The inhibition of platelet aggregation was investigated using
human platelet-rich plasma. In this assay, an IC50 of 43 nM was
determined for tirofiban and 147 nM for 19F-GP1 (Supplemental
Fig. 1; supplemental materials are available at http://jnm.snmjournals.
org). The ability of 18F-GP1 to bind to an explanted human thrombus
from the left ventricle was analyzed by autoradiography. After in-
cubation with 18F-GP1, a strong signal bound to the thrombus was
observed that can be fully displaced by competition with excess
GPIIb/IIIa ligand. CD41 (GPIIb) staining of the slices confirmed that
18F-GP1 bound in regions with cellular platelet deposition (Fig. 2B).
Because binding to isolated receptors and on tissue slides is
static, the binding characteristics of 18F-GP1 were investigated dur-
ing circulation in a less artificial environment. An in vitro blood
flow model was established, allowing thrombus formation under
standardized conditions (Figs. 3A and 3B). In this model, 18F-
GP1 showed a strong accumulation at the site of thrombus forma-
tion. The binding was specific and could be blocked by addition of
an excess of elarofiban. Clots in this model were CD41-positive by
immunohistochemistry (data not shown). The average clot-to-blood
ratio was 95.2 6 50.2 for 18F-GP1 and 35.2 6 17.6 for apcitide
(Fig. 3C). The impact of therapeutics to prevent blood clots (e.g.,
aspirin and heparin) on 18F-GP1 binding to thrombi was examined
in the in vitro thrombus model. 18F-GP1 still bound strongly and
specifically to thrombi despite the pretreatment with heparin or
aspirin. The clot-to-blood ratio was significantly different between
unblocked and blocked (P , 0.01) under all conditions studied as
shown by an unpaired t test.
The binding characteristics of 18F-GP1 were further analyzed in
the blood flow model by continuous signal detection using a PET
camera. Immediately after tracer addition, a signal at the thrombus
site was measured, increasing throughout the 3-min tracer circu-
lation time frame. The signal at the thrombi remained over the
entire imaging period (Fig. 4). In 1 set of experiments, excess
nonradioactive 19F-GP1 was added to the circuit at 30 min and
thrombus-bound radioactivity was abolished over the next 30 min.
Cynomolgus Monkey PET Imaging
Biodistribution analysis in cynomolgus monkeys showed rapid
clearance of 18F-GP1 from healthy tissues and the blood. The
tracer concentration measured in the aorta by PET was in good
agreement with the activity measured in blood samples. After the
imaging study was finished, at 60 min after injection the animals
were sacrificed and an ex vivo organ distribution analysis was
performed. Low organ uptake was observed except the gallbladder
(Supplemental Figs. 2A and 2B). The maximum-intensity projec-
tion of summed frames from the thorax region obtained directly
after injection (0–5 min) visualized the activity in the main blood
vessels. At later time points (40–60 min), no detectable signal was
observed in the thorax (Supplemental Figs. 2C and 2D).
For the in vivo thrombus imaging, a catheter with a roughened
thrombogenic area was placed into the left carotid artery of
cynomolgus monkeys as shown in a schematic illustration (Fig.
5A). The PET images obtained from all 3 animals examined re-
vealed a strong signal inside the descending aorta along the rough-
ened part of the catheter, with no visible signal associated with the
nonroughened catheter and only a sparse signal in the surrounding
tissues (Fig. 5B). After removal of the catheters from the animals, a
thin layer of thrombi covering the roughened part of the catheter
was observed. The thrombogenic volume (1-cm length · 0.2-cm
diameter, ;30 mL) indicates that the method allows for detection of
even small thrombi with high detection sensitivity. No comparison

 with other standard imaging techniques such as CT, pulmonary
angiography, or ultrasonography was performed in this study. A
signal inside the brain was anecdotally noted when other parts of
the body were scanned after the 60-min dynamic scan of the thorax
was finished (Fig. 5C). Autopsy revealed a thrombus within the
internal carotid artery/Circle of Willis junction (Fig. 5D). It remains
unclear if this thrombus detached from the aortic thrombus at the
beginning of the experiment (before tracer injection) or at the end of
the experiment (after tracer injection). Therefore, it is not yet con-
firmed that 18F-GP1 can target emboli in the brain; however, the
profound spatial resolution was confirmed. In the other studied
monkeys, the brains were completely free of any signal. Additional
studies are required to assess whether thromboembolic events can
be imaged in animal models or humans.
Through insertion of catheters into the right carotid artery and
into the vena cava, arterial and venous thrombi were induced in
cynomolgus monkeys. Both, the arterial and the venous thrombi
were equally visualized by 18F-GP1 PET imaging, with almost no
background from any organ or tissue in the field of view (Fig. 6A). A
thin layer of thrombus formation was observed at the roughened
areas that showed the same pattern as the PET signals. In the animal
shown, the left carotid artery was accidentally injured during the
insertion of the catheter into the left jugular vein. This caused an
endothelial damage that was confirmed at necropsy. The resulting
small thrombotic depositions at the damaged endothelial surface
were clearly visualized in vivo in the PET image. Although unin-
tended, this observation emphasizes that 18F-GP1 is capable of visu-
alizing small arterial thrombi, formed in situ within a monkey carotid
artery. Time–activity curves confirmed stable binding to both arterial
and venous thrombi throughout the 60-min dynamic scan (Fig. 6B).
DISCUSSION
The development of high-affinity, rapidly clearing radiolabeled
small molecules targeting GPIIb/IIIa together with the recent
advances in PET imaging technologies provide an opportunity to
overcome the limitations of the previously
introduced SPECT agents by detecting
thrombi with improved spatial resolution
and detection sensitivity. The elarofiban
scaffold was selected on the basis of suit-
able pharmacokinetic properties and feasi-
bility for incorporating the 18F radiolabel
without losing biologic activity. Binding
studies with either purified GPIIb/IIIa or
human thrombus showed that modification
of elarofiban with a small fluoro-containing
moiety did not affect the binding affinity. In
fact, the 19F-GP1 derivative showed in this
competition assay an IC50 value similar to
the parent elarofiban molecule. The mea-
sured IC50 value of the parent elarofiban in
this assay was higher than its reported IC50
value using biotinylated fibrinogen in a
competition assay (0.4 nM) (13). Because
different ligands and conditions were ap-
plied, these values cannot be directly com-
pared but it can be concluded that the high
affinity of elarofiban for GPIIb/IIIa is
retained for 18F-GP1.
Species differences in the ligand binding
to the GPIIb/IIIa receptors are reported in
the literature (13,16,25,26), and rodents were shown to be not
appropriate for the in vivo evaluation of this class of new receptor
ligands. Species-dependent effects are also reported for elarofiban,
necessitating the use of human blood or thrombi for binding stud-
ies and autoradiography as well as establishing a nonhuman pri-
mate model for PET imaging of thrombi. Moderate inhibition of
platelet aggregation was observed with 19F-GP1. The very low
mass dose (,10 mg per dose) applied for radiotracer imaging
would result in an initial blood concentration in humans that will
be more than 50-fold below the IC50 for aggregation inhibition.

GP1 remained bound to thrombus over whole imaging procedure. After

placement of thrombus-bound signal was observed until 60 min.

 Together with the rapid tracer clearance this makes bleeding ad-
verse events extremely unlikely.
An important consideration, which is not addressed well enough
in the applied in vitro and in vivo models, is the target specificity
of the current compound compared with previous RGD mimetics.
It has been shown that cyclic RGD compounds bind to GPIIb/IIIa
as well as other integrins, particularly avb3. The target avb3 is
present on activated endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.
Other integrins are present on inflammatory cells. This may ex-
plain why agents such as apcitide show a
diffuse soft-tissue uptake in the vicinity of
the DVT. Elarofiban has shown a more
than 300,000-fold specificity for GPIIb/
IIIa over avb3 (27), and it can be postu-
lated that the thrombus is better visualized
using an elarofiban derivative without ob-
fuscation by the surrounding inflamed tis-
sue in humans. Higher target specificity
should also allow a more accurate detec-
tion of pathologic mechanisms in athero-
sclerosis where both platelets and vascular
cells are implicated. In principle it will also
improve the discrimination between infec-
tious and thrombogenic events (e.g., endo-
carditis, valvular vegetations), although this
has yet to be tested.
The human ex vivo blood circuit is a
simple model to study clot formation in
vitro and is flexible, allowing investigations
of different blood species, anticoagulants,
and flow rates. Coupling the blood circuit to
a PET camera allows real-time quantifica-
tion of clot binding and retention. Especially
measurements under arterial flow rates were
used to maximize the adhesion of activated
platelets. The combined results of abroga-
tion of tracer binding to the clot by addition
of excess unlabeled GP1 or elarofiban and
unaffected clot accumulation of 18F-GP1
under aspirin or heparin treatment confirm specific tracer binding.
Real-time assessment when the nidus was placed inside a PET cam-
era recapitulated the results and, furthermore, confirmed the rapid
accumulation and visualization of the retained 18F-GP1 on the clot.
Preclinical proof of in vivo thrombus imaging was obtained after
insertion of analogously prepared roughened polyethylene catheters
into the primate arterial system and into the venous system. Even
small thrombi were easily and distinctly visualized at the roughened
catheter region. The ability to image small thrombi was confirmed
by the observation in 1 animal in which the
carotid artery was inadvertently damaged
during catheter placement. This recapitu-
lated a real-life situation and showed that
18F-GP1 was able to visualize naturally oc-
curring thrombi. The intracerebral clot visu-
alization was opportunistic but gave insight
into the possible capabilities of 18F-GP1. It
is unknown whether 18F-GP1 was injected
before or after the arterial thrombus was
displaced and lodged in the brain. Nonethe-
less, it represents the visualization of a small
clot lodged in the middle cerebral artery
and bodes well for the possibility of imag-
ing strokes/cerebrovascular accidents in
humans.
CONCLUSION
18F-GP1 is a promising novel PET
tracer for thrombus imaging in vitro and
in vivo. It binds with high affinity to
GPIIb/IIIa, the key receptor for platelet

 aggregation. Strong binding was observed on an explanted human
cardiac thrombus, in the in vitro human blood flow–thrombus
model, and on platelet depositions on catheter and endothelium
surfaces as well as on emboli in cynomolgus monkeys, confirming
its potential for PET imaging of such thrombogenic events. Effi-
cacy was not altered by anticoagulation therapy. A favorable bio-
distribution profile supports the translation of 18F-GP1 into the
clinic. A first-in-human study is currently ongoing and further
conclusions await clinical trial results.
