Abstract
There is growing evidence that stress leads to contrasting patterns of structural
plasticity in the hippocampus and amygdala, two brain areas implicated in the
cognitive and affective symptoms of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Acute
stress has been shown to trigger a delayed increase in the density of dendritic
spines in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of rodents. However, the physiologi-
cal correlates of this delayed spinogenesis in the BLA remain unexplored. Fur-
thermore, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) have been known to underlie chronic
stress-induced structural plasticity in the hippocampus, but nothing is known
about the role of these receptors in the delayed spinogenesis, and its physio-
logical consequences, in the BLA following acute stress. Here, using whole-cell
recordings in rat brain slices, we find that a single exposure to 2-h immobi-
lization stress enhances the frequency, but not amplitude, of miniature excita-
tory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) recorded from principal neurons in the
BLA 10 days later. This was also accompanied by faster use-dependent block
of NMDA receptor currents during repeated stimulation of thalamic inputs to
the BLA, which is indicative of higher presynaptic release probability at these
inputs 10 days later. Furthermore, targeted in vivo infusion of the NMDAR-
antagonist APV into the BLA during the acute stress prevents the increase in
mEPSC frequency and spine density 10 days later. Together, these results
identify a role for NMDARs during acute stress in both the physiological and
morphological strengthening of synaptic connectivity in the BLA in a delayed
fashion. These findings also raise the possibility that activation of NMDA
receptors during stress may serve as a common molecular mechanism despite
the divergent patterns of plasticity that eventually emerge after stress in the
amygdala and hippocampus.
Introduction
Accumulating evidence from animal models indicates that
stress-induced
plasticity
varies
across
different
brain
regions (McEwen and Sapolsky 1995; Popoli et al. 2012;
Chattarji et al. 2015). For instance, earlier studies reveal
that chronic stress causes dendritic atrophy in CA3
pyramidal neurons of the rodent hippocampus (McEwen
1999; Vyas et al. 2002). In the basolateral amygdala
(BLA), by contrast, chronic stress triggers the opposite
effect by strengthening the structural basis of synaptic
connectivity through dendritic growth and spinogenesis
(Vyas et al. 2002; Mitra et al. 2005; Roozendaal et al.
2009). Furthermore, the unique features of stress-induced

 morphological plasticity in the BLA are not limited to
chronic stress alone. The temporal profile of structural
plasticity in the BLA can also be modulated by the dura-
tion of the stressor. For example, a single 2-h exposure to
immobilization stress leads to a significant increase in
spine density that is evident only 10 days after the stress
and not 1 day later (Mitra et al. 2005). Together, these
studies have helped identify unique spatiotemporal fea-
tures of stress-induced plasticity in the amygdala that are
quite distinct from those observed in the hippocampus.
However, compared to the decades of research on
stress-induced plasticity in the hippocampus, relatively lit-
tle is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying
the effects of stress in the amygdala. In the hippocampus,
both stress and glucocorticoid treatment cause enhanced
expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype
of glutamate receptors (Bartanusz et al. 1995; Weiland
et al. 1997). Furthermore, pharmacological antagonism of
NMDA receptors (NMDARs) blocks stress-induced plas-
ticity in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) (Armanini et al. 1990; Magari~
nos and McEwen
1995; Gould et al. 1997; Martin and Wellman 2011).
However, as mentioned earlier, the patterns of stress-
induced morphological changes in the hippocampus/
mPFC are generally opposite to those seen in the BLA
(e.g., loss vs. growth of dendrites and spines) (Vyas et al.
2002; Mitra et al. 2005; Pawlak et al. 2005; Chen et al.
2008).
This
raises
the
question
whether
the
same
NMDARs can mediate contrasting patterns of structural
plasticity in the amygdala. Moreover, many of the earlier
findings were drawn primarily from models of chronic or
repeated stress (e.g., 10 days of immobilization stress or
21 days of restraint stress) and their impact on plasticity
soon after the end of stress. Nothing is known about how
a brief stressor leads to the delayed spinogenesis in the
BLA (Mitra et al. 2005; Rao et al. 2012). Therefore, this
study focused on this gap in knowledge by addressing
two specific questions. First, we investigated the physio-
logical correlates of the delayed formation of new den-
dritic spines in the BLA 10 days after a single episode of
2-h immobilization stress. Second, we examined if NMDA
receptor activity in the BLA during this acute stressor
plays a role in the eventual spinogenesis, and its physio-
logical consequences, 10 days later.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Male
Wistar
rats
(55–70 days
old,
330–400 g)
were
housed in a 14/10-h light/dark schedule (lights on at
8 AM) with ad libitum access to food and water at the
National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, India.
The Institutional Animal Ethics Committee approved all
procedures related to animal maintenance and experimen-
tation.
Stress
Rats were subjected to a single, 2-h episode of acute
immobilization stress (Mitra et al. 2005) between 10 AM
and 12 PM in plastic immobilization bags in a room dif-
ferent from that used for housing. Rats had no access to
food or water during this 2-h period. However, they had
access to air through a sufficiently large opening at the
tip of the immobilization bags adjacent to the rat’s nose.
After stress, animals were returned to home cages and
subjected to electrophysiological/morphological analysis
10 days after acute stress.
Targeted pharmacological infusion of APV
into the BLA
Prior to surgery, rats were anesthetized with intraperi-
toneal
administration
of
a
cocktail
of
ketamine
(80 mg kg�1 of body weight) and xylazine (10 mg kg�1).
Body temperature was maintained with a heating pad.
Rats were surgically implanted with bilateral, chronic,
intracranial stainless steel guide cannulae (7 mm long, 26
gauge, Plastic One) aimed 1 mm above the BLA (stereo-
taxic coordinates: 2.5 mm posterior to bregma, �5 mm
lateral to midline, and 6.5 mm ventral from the bregma
level) (Paxinos and Watson 2005). Intraamygdala infu-
sions were carried out using standard procedures as
described earlier (Wilensky et al. 2006). Briefly, after
postsurgical recovery (7–10 days), infusions were per-
formed either in the rats’ home cage or while the rats
were stressed in rodent immobilization bags by inserting
infusion cannulae (31 gauge) through the guide cannulae.
This was connected through polyethylene tubing to a
Hamilton syringe (10 lL), which was mounted on an
infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Rats
were infused bilaterally with either vehicle (aCSF, 0.5 lL
per side) or APV (0.5 lL per side, 1 lg lL�1 in aCSF) at
a rate of 0.1 lL min�1. After waiting for 5 min, the infu-
sion cannulae were taken out to allow the drug to diffuse.
Preparation of amydalar slices and
electrophysiology
Rats were deeply anaesthetized with halothane and decap-
itated. The brain was removed rapidly and transferred to
ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF: 115 mmol

thickness) containing the amygdala were cut using Vibra-
tome 1000 Plus tissue slicer (Vibratome, St. Louis, MO)
and then transferred to a storage chamber containing
aCSF (room temperature; equilibrated with 95% O2/5%
CO2), where they were allowed to recover for at least 1 h
before being transferred to a submerged recording cham-
ber
at
room
temperature,
attached
to
an
Olympus
BX51WI microscope.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, from excitatory
principal neurons in the BLA were obtained under IR-
DIC visualization (BX51WI, Olympus, Melville, NY). To
this end, we selected neurons possessing large somata,
which are typical of spiny excitatory principal neurons in
the BLA (Mahanty and Sah 1999; Weisskopf et al. 1999).

(pH
7.3;
285 mOsm). Recordings were done using a HEKA EPC10
Plus amplifier (Heka Electronik) filtered at 2.9 kHz and
digitized at 10 kHz. Monosynaptic EPSCs were elicited by
stimulation of thalamic afferent fibers with a bipolar
twisted platinum/iridium wire (2 9 25 lm, FHC, Bow-
doin). Only cells with membrane potentials more negative
than �60 mV were included in this study. In addition,
series resistance (Rs) was tested and recordings were not
used if they changed by more than 20% from beginning
to end for mEPSC recordings and 25% for MK-801
recordings or if the Rs exceeded 25 MΩ.
mEPSC recording
Cells were held at �70 mV for recording miniature EPSCs
(mEPSCs), which were pharmacologically isolated by add-
ing TTX (1 lmol L�1) and picrotoxin (75 lmol L�1) to
the recording solution. Continuous current traces of 5-min
duration (recorded at least 5 min after achieving whole-cell
configuration) were analyzed using the Mini Analysis Pro-
gram (Synaptosoft, Fort Lee, NJ).
MK-801-induced decays of NMDAR currents
To assess changes in presynaptic release probability,
NMDAR-mediated component of evoked thalamic EPSCs
was isolated by recording at a holding potential of +40 mV
in the presence of picrotoxin (75 lmol L�1) and CNQX
(10 lmol L�1). EPSCs were evoked every 20 sec. MK-801
(5 lmol L�1) was added to the perfusate and stimulation
was paused for 10 min to allow for equilibration. Stimula-
tion was then resumed and the decay of NMDAR-EPSC
amplitudes measured. EPSC amplitudes were measured
and normalized to the first trace in MK-801. The time
course the MK-801 induced block of the subsequent 100
EPSCs was fitted by a single exponential in order to obtain
a time constant that gave a measure of the number of
stimuli required to produce an e-fold decay of the
NMDAR-mediated EPSC amplitude.
Values are reported as mean � SEM. Statistical com-
parisons were made using ‘n’ as number of cells after
using Levene’s test and single-sample Kolmogorov–Smir-
nov (K–S) test for appropriate assumptions of variance
and normality of distribution. Comparisons between two
groups were done using unpaired Student’s t-test. Multi-
ple-group comparisons were carried out using ANOVA
followed by post hoc pairwise tests. Comparison for
cumulative distributions between two groups was done
using two-sample K–S test and Kruskal–Wallis test fol-
lowed by post hoc pairwise tests were used for compar-
isons between multiple groups.
Golgi staining and dendritic spine density
analysis
Animals were sacrificed under deep halothane anesthesia.
The brains were rapidly dissected out and placed in freshly
prepared Golgi-Cox fixative (5% potassium dichromate,
5% mercuric chloride, and 4% potassium chromate;
100 mL of each; 400 mL of water added later to make up
the working fixative). After 8–10 weeks of incubation per-
iod, 120-lm-thick coronal sections of the brain were cut
using a VibratomeVT1200 S (Leica). These sections were
then developed using 5% sodium carbonate for 20 min
and then dehydrated using a graded series of alcohol solu-
tions, cleared in xylene, and mounted with DPX.
Coronal sections (120 lm) containing BLA (Bregma
1.92 to �3.12 mm) were used to visualize medium spiny
pyramidal neurons (Paxinos and Watson 2005). An
experimenter blind to treatment conditions quantified
spine density. All protrusions (irrespective of morphologi-
cal characteristics) on primary dendrite were counted as
spines along an 80-lm stretch using NeuroLucida (Micro-
BrightField Inc., Williston, Vermont) attached to an
Olympus BX61 microscope (100X, 1.3 numerical aper-
ture). Values are reported as mean � SEM. Statistical sig-
nificance was calculated using ANOVA followed by post
hoc pairwise tests and n refers to the number of dendrites
used for spine density analysis.
Chemicals
APV and MK-801 was obtained from Tocris Bioscience
(Avonmouth, Bristol, UK) or Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO); TTX and QX-314 was obtained from Alomone
Labs, (Jerusalem, Israel). All other drugs were from
Sigma-Aldrich.

Stress, NMDA Receptors, and the Amygdala
 Results
Acute stress caused a delayed increase in
the frequency of miniature excitatory
postsynaptic currents in BLA principal
neurons
We previously reported that a single episode of 2-h
immobilization leads to a delayed increase in spine den-
sity on BLA principal neurons 10 days later (Mitra et al.
2005; Rao et al. 2012). As dendritic spines are the site of
excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain,
we first examined if this delayed strengthening in the
structural basis of synaptic connectivity in the BLA also
has a physiological correlate that is manifested as a
delayed modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission.
To this end, we used whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings
in brain slices (Materials and Methods) taken from con-
trol and stressed rats to compare miniature AMPAR-
mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in
BLA principal neurons (Fig. 1A–C). Ten days after the 2-
h acute stress, BLA neurons from stressed animals exhib-
ited a significant increase in mEPSC frequency (Control:
0.49 � 0.06 Hz, n = 16; Stress: 0.96 � 0.10 Hz, n = 17;
Unpaired t-test, ***P < 0.001; Fig. 1D), but not mEPSC
amplitude
(Control:
16.92 � 0.48 pA,
n = 16;
Stress:
17.67 � 0.53 pA, n = 17; Fig. 1F). This selective increase
in mEPSC frequency was also reflected in a significant
leftward shift in the cumulative frequency distribution
toward shorter interevent intervals in stressed neurons
[K–S test, P < 0.0001, Fig. 1E]. Stress had no effects on
the rise time and decay time of mEPSCs (Fig. 1F).
Acute stress caused a delayed increase in
presynaptic release probability at the
thalamic inputs to BLA neurons
While the stress-induced enhancement in mEPSC fre-
quency is consistent with an increase in the number of
dendritic spines (Turrigiano and Nelson 2004), such an
increase could also be caused by enhanced presynaptic
transmitter release (Prange and Murphy 1999; Turrigiano
and Nelson 2004). Therefore, we analyzed the potential
effect of acute stress on presynaptic release probability
(Pr) by repeated stimulation of the thalamic inputs to
BLA cells in the presence of the NMDAR open-channel
blocker (5S,10R)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo
[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-iminemaleate (MK-801) (Fourcau-
dot et al. 2008). This led to a progressive decay of
NMDAR-EPSCs (Fig. 2A), the decay constant of which is
inversely related to the probability of release (Rosenmund
et al. 1993; Manabe and Nicoll 1994). The decay kinetics
were fit to a single exponential and the time constant of
decay was compared across slices taken from stressed and
control animals (Fig. 2B). Ten days after acute stress,
BLA neurons from stressed animals exhibited a significant
reduction in the decay constant (Control: 33.47 � 2.3,
n = 12; Stress:
25.03 � 2.03,
n = 12; Unpaired
t-test
*P < 0.05; Fig. 2C). These results point to an increase in
Pr caused by the same acute stress that also enhances
mEPSC frequency 10 days later.
Targeted infusion of APV into the BLA
during acute stress blocked the delayed
increase in mEPSC frequency
Next, we investigated the potential involvement of NMDA
receptors in the BLA during acute stress in the delayed
enhancement of mEPSC frequency 10 days later. To this
end, rats received a targeted, bilateral infusion (Materials
and Methods) of either vehicle (Veh) or the NMDAR-
antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphono-valeric acid (APV) into
the BLA at the beginning of the 2-h immobilization stress
protocol (Fig. 3A). Ten days later, mEPSCs were recorded
from BLA principal neurons in brain slices obtained from
these animals (Fig. 3A and B, top and middle). We first
confirmed that targeted in vivo infusion of vehicle into
the BLA had no impact on the efficacy of acute stress in
increasing
mEPSC
frequency
in
BLA
neurons
(Stress + Veh, Fig. 3C). The enhanced level of mEPSC
frequency in stressed animals that received vehicle infu-
sion into the BLA was not significantly different (un-
paired t-test, P = 0.96) from those seen earlier in intact
animals after exposure to the same acute stress alone (the
mean value for mEPSC frequency in stressed animals
from Figure 1D are replotted as a dotted red line for
comparison in Figure 3C). Strikingly, targeted infusion of
APV into the BLA during the 2-h stress prevented the
stress-induced
enhancement
in
mEPSC
frequency
observed in Stress + Veh animals (the mean value for
mEPSC frequency in control animals from Figure 1D is
replotted as a dotted black line for comparison). This
reversal of the stress-induced enhancement in mEPSC fre-
quency by APV was statistically significant (Fig. 3C,
Stress + Veh:
0.84 � 0.10 Hz,
n = 17;
Stress + APV:
0.30 � 0.04 Hz,
n = 15;
One-way
ANOVA,
F(2,43) = 15.41, P < 0.0001; ***P < 0.001, Holm–Sidak’s
multiple comparisons test). Furthermore, the effects of
APV infusion into the BLA were specific to stressed ani-
mals as it did not result in any additional reduction in
mEPSC frequency in control animals (Control + APV:
0.38 � 0.04 Hz, n = 14). The cumulative distribution of
mEPSC

interval
(Fig. 3D)
in
APV-infused
stressed animals showed a significant rightward shift rela-
tive to vehicle-infused stressed animals but overlapped
with control animals treated with APV (Kruskal–Wallis

mEPSC amplitude, rise time, or decay time was not
affected by either vehicle or APV infusion into the BLA
during the 2-h stress (Fig. 3E).
Targeted APV infusion into the BLA during
acute stress also prevented the delayed
increase in spine density
As described earlier, the acute stress paradigm used here
has previously been shown to elicit a delayed increase in
spine density in BLA principal neurons at the same10-day

 time point (Mitra et al. 2005) when mEPSC frequency is
enhanced. Therefore, the prevention of the physiological
effects of acute stress by APV raises the possibility that
blocking NMDA receptors could also reverse the morpho-
logical effects manifested as delayed spinogenesis in the
BLA. To test this prediction, spine density on primary
dendrites of BLA pyramidal neurons was quantified
10 days after acute stress in rats that were exposed to
acute stress with infusions of either vehicle or APV into
the BLA, as well as control rats that received the same

vented by infusion of APV into the BLA (total number of

test, Fig. 4B right and C). Furthermore, a more detailed
segmental analysis of spine density along the dendritic
length revealed how this prevention of delayed spinogene-
sis by APV infusion into the BLA is distributed across the
length of primary apical dendrites analyzed (Fig. 4D).
Interestingly, APV infusion into the BLA of control ani-
mals did not lead to further changes in spine numbers,
suggesting that blocking NMDA receptors affects spine
density only under stressed, but not normal, conditions
(Fig. 4D).
Discussion
This study is one of the first attempts to explore two key
facets of the delayed spinogenesis in the basolateral amyg-
dala (BLA) triggered by a single episode of acute stress –
one in terms of its physiological correlates, and the other
concerning a molecular mechanism. First, we tested
whether a single 2-h exposure to immobilization stress
elicits changes in excitatory synaptic transmission that
parallel the formation of dendritic spines reported previ-
ously in the BLA (Mitra et al. 2005). We find that the
same stressor leads to a selective increase in the fre-
quency, but not amplitude, of mEPSCs in BLA principal

Stress, NMDA Receptors, and the Amygdala
 pharmacological inactivation of NMDA receptors in the
BLA during acute stress prevent its delayed impact on
enhanced
mEPSC
frequency,
but
it
also blocks
the
delayed increase in spine density 10 days later. Together,
these findings identify a role for NMDA receptors during
acute stress in both the physiological and morphological
strengthening of synaptic connectivity in the BLA in a
delayed fashion.
These results identifying a role for NMDA receptors in
the BLA during acute stress in the eventual formation of
dendritic spines are interesting for several reasons. Stress-
induced release of glucocorticoids has been shown to
induce a rapid but transient increase in glutamate neuro-
transmission in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus
(Lowy et al. 1995; Karst et al. 2005; Yuen et al. 2009).
The amygdala also shows a similar rapid increase in glu-
tamate levels with stress; but unlike the hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex, the increase in glutamate neurotrans-
mission in the amygdala is longer lasting, for up to a few
hours (Reznikov et al. 2007; Karst et al. 2010). This
increase in glutamate levels could act upon NMDA recep-
tors in the BLA to create an ideal synaptic substrate that

of the BLA compared to vehicle-infused animals that were subjected to stress. Control animals infused with APV show levels comparable to
stressed animals infused with APV. Asterisk indicates significant differences (***P < 0.001, Two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparisons
test). (D) Segmental analysis of mean numbers of spines in each successive 10-lm segment of the primary dendrite as a function of the

Stress, NMDA Receptors, and the Amygdala
F. Yasmin et al.
 eventually leads to a delayed formation of new dendritic
spines. Furthermore, electrophysiological studies in amyg-
dalar slices have demonstrated that in vitro application of
stress levels of corticosterone leads to a reduction in
GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission, as well as
enhanced intrinsic excitability of BLA excitatory principal
neurons (Duvarci and Par�
e 2007). Together, these factors
could create conditions wherein stress-induced disinhibi-
tion frees up the excitatory glutamatergic synapses on
BLA neurons to undergo plasticity that eventually leads to
a delayed strengthening of the structural basis of synaptic
connectivity, manifested as newly formed dendritic spines
in the BLA (Roozendaal et al. 2009).
How could NMDA receptors contribute to synaptic
plasticity mechanisms that eventually culminate in the
spinogenesis after acute stress? A significant body of evi-
dence has demonstrated that formation of new dendritic
protrusions and spines can be triggered by long-term
potentiation
(LTP),
a
synaptic
plasticity
mechanism
thought to underlie learning and memory (Engert and
Bonhoeffer 1999; Yuste and Bonhoeffer 2001). Such LTP-
induced spinogenesis could be mediated through splitting
of preexisting spines or spine formation de novo (Toni
et al. 1999; Harris et al. 2003). Findings, derived mostly
from studies in the hippocampus, suggest that NMDA
receptors play a critical role in LTP and activity-depen-
dent spinogenesis (Fischer et al. 2000; Yuste and Bonhoef-
fer 2001). The existence of NMDA receptor-dependent
LTP in the BLA, and its role in fear memory, is also well
established (Chapman et al. 1990; McKernan and Shin-
nick-Gallagher 1997). While nothing is known about the
delayed impact of a single episode of 2-h immobilization
stress on NMDA receptor currents, repeating the same
stressor for 10 consecutive days (i.e., chronic immobiliza-
tion stress) has been shown to enhance LTP and NMDAR
currents by addition of NMDARs, not to preexisting
AMPAR-containing
synapses,
but
to
new
synapses,
thereby
creating
NMDAR-only
or
so-called
“silent
synapses” in the BLA (Suvrathan et al. 2014). Thus, in
addition to the stress-induced increase in glutamate levels
that could act on NMDA receptors, stress could also
modulate
excitatory
synaptic
currents
mediated
by
NMDA receptors. Also, the identity of these newly added
receptors could itself be of consequence. Indeed, NMDA
receptors containing NR2B subunits contribute to longer
EPSPs, which provide longer time window for coinci-
dence detection and hence affect synaptic plasticity (Mon-
yer et al. 1994). Selective blockade of NR2B subunit by
using ifenprodil not only impairs amygdalar LTP but also
disrupts acquisition of fear learning (Rodrigues et al.
2001). Hence, our findings, pointing to a role for NMDA
receptors in the delayed synaptic impact of an acute
stress, raise the possibility that even a single episode of
severe stress may leave its mark in the amygdala by gener-
ating new synapses with greater capacity for plasticity.
Further experiments are necessary to explore if and how
acute immobilization stress alters the extent or ability of
BLA neurons to undergo LTP after stress. For example, it
would be interesting to examine if there are specific time
points when LTP may be affected, for example, during or
soon after the end of stress or at later time points well
after the end of stress.
What are the functional implications of the delayed
electrophysiological effects of acute stress on mEPSCs
alongside enhanced spine density? While the amplitude of
mEPSCs is indicative of the strength of individual func-
tional synapses, the frequency of mEPSCs is dependent
on synapse number. Thus, the stress-induced enhance-
ment in mEPSC frequency is consistent with an increase
in the number of dendritic spines (Burrone et al. 2002;
Turrigiano and Nelson 2004). On the other hand, the
absence of any change in the amplitude of mEPSCs sug-
gests that the strength of individual synapses may not be
affected by acute stress (Turrigiano et al. 1998). The
increase in mEPSC frequency in BLA neurons in stressed
animals also led us to examine potential changes in presy-
naptic release probability. To test this possibility, we com-
pared probability of release (Pr) by repeatedly stimulating
thalamic inputs to BLA principal neurons in the presence
of the NMDAR open-channel blocker MK-801 (Rosen-
mund et al. 1993; Turrigiano and Nelson 2004; Fourcau-
dot et al. 2008). This analysis points to a delayed increase
in Pr caused by the same acute stress that also enhances
mEPSC frequency 10 days later. This provides novel evi-
dence for a presynaptic enhancement in release probabil-
ity concomitant with changes in spine number triggered
by acute stress. Together these physiological (presynaptic
release) and morphological (spine) changes may better
account
for
the
increase
in
mEPSC
frequency
seen
10 days after acute stress.
Finally, a role for NMDAR-induced plasticity in the
delayed effects of acute stress opens up new lines of inves-
tigation to test the efficacy of pharmacological interven-
tions after stress. For example, how long after the end of
stress would inactivation of NMDARs in the amygdala
block
the
delayed
effects
on
synaptic
connectivity?
Together, such studies will provide a useful framework
for analyzing the gradual progression of the initial cellular
and molecular changes in the amygdala triggered by a
brief, severe stress that build up into amygdalar dysfunc-
tion and potential therapeutic interventions against it.
