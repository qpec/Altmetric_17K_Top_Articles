S
troke is a leading cause of death, disability, and dementia 
globally with 87% of the burden being borne by low- and 
middle-income countries.1 The World Health Organization 
estimates indicate that death from stroke and disability-
adjusted life years lost to stroke are ≈7 times higher in low- and 
middle-income countries—including much of Africa—than 
Background and Purpose—The relative contributions of racial and geographic factors to higher risk of stroke in people 
of African ancestry have not been unraveled. We compared stroke type and contributions of vascular risk factors among 
indigenous Africans (IA), African Americans (AA), and European Americans (EA).
Methods—SIREN (Stroke Investigative Research and Educational Network) is a large multinational case–control study in West 
Africa—the ancestral home of 71% AA—whereas REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) 
is a cohort study including AA and EA in the United States. Using harmonized assessments and standard definitions, we 
compared data on stroke type and established risk factors for stroke in acute stroke cases aged ≥55 years in both studies.
Results—There were 811 IA, 452 AA, and 665 EA stroke subjects, with mean age of 68.0±9.3, 73.0±8.3, and 76.0±8.3 
years, respectively (P<0.0001). Hemorrhagic stroke was more frequent among IA (27%) compared with AA (8%) and 
EA (5.4%; P<0.001). Lacunar strokes were more prevalent in IA (47.1%), followed by AA (35.1%) and then EA (21.0%; 
P<0.0001). The frequency of hypertension in decreasing order was IA (92.8%), followed by AA (82.5%) and then EA 
(64.2%; P<0.0001) and similarly for diabetes mellitus IA (38.3%), AA (36.8%), and EA (21.0%; P<0.0001). Premorbid 
sedentary lifestyle was similar in AA (37.7%) and EA (34.0%) but lower frequency in IA (8.0%).
Conclusions—Environmental risk factors such as sedentary lifestyle may contribute to the higher proportion of ischemic stroke 
in AA compared with IA, whereas racial factors may contribute to the higher proportion of hypertension and diabetes mellitus 
among stroke subjects of African ancestry.

in high-income countries.2 In sharp contrast to high-income 
countries, estimates from the GBD study (Global Burden of 
Disease) suggest that stroke incidence is rising in African 
countries where as a major health challenge, it is levying a 
heavy toll on the developing economy by affecting a relatively 
younger age group.1,3,4
For poorly understood reasons, people of African ancestry 
have a higher risk of stroke, earlier age of occurrence, poorer 
outcomes, and relatively higher percentage of strokes being 
hemorrhagic type than people of other ancestry.3–5 The Ibadan-
Berlin Stroke Study, which compared stroke patients in Nigeria 
and Germany, suggested that regional variations in the burden of 
stroke risk factor may account for regional differences in the pro-
portions of stroke phenotypes.6 Indeed, the GBD 2013 illustrated 
the existence of regional differences in distribution of stroke risk 
factors.7 This was corroborated by the INTERSTROKE study,8,9 
which demonstrated regional differences in stroke type and 
risk factors but did not decipher if the regional variations in the 
contributions of risk factors were because of racial (including 
genetic) and geographical (environmental) differences.8–10
The relative contribution of racial and geographic factors 
to stroke and its risk factors among people of African ances-
try (regardless of their present geographical location) is still 
unknown.11,12 A rare opportunity to unravel this is provided 
given that 71% of African Americans (AA) are of the Niger-
Kordofanian ancestry from West Africa from where they 
migrated several centuries ago.13,14 Therefore, as a first step 
to deciphering the relative contributions of racial (including 
genetic) and geographic (environmental) factors for stroke in 
present day indigenous West Africans and AA (most of who 
originated from West Africa), we characterized the stroke type 
and risk factor profile of strokes in these populations in con-
trast to European Americans (EA).
Specifically, we compared characteristics and risk factors 
of strokes in indigenous Africans (IA) in West Africa within 
the SIREN (Stroke Investigative Research and Educational 
Network), the largest study of stroke in Africa to date,4,11 with 
strokes in AA and EA within the REGARDS study (Reasons 
for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) in the United 
States.12 Our central hypothesis a priori was that the characteris-
tics of stroke and vascular risk factors in stroke with strong racial 
underpinning would be similar among IA and AA, but differ-
ent from that among EA. Vascular factors with dominant racial 
(probably genetic) underpinnings discovered may be generaliz-
able to people of African ancestry and serve as rewarding targets 
for stroke prevention and other interventions in this population.
Methods
The detailed protocols of the SIREN11 and REGARDS12,15 studies have 
been published elsewhere. SIREN is a case–control study, whereas 
REGARDS is a population-based cohort study. A brief summary of 
the protocols is presented in the online-only Data Supplement. This is 
a comparative analysis of stroke subjects in both studies.
Data Harmonization and Risk Factor Definitions
For the purpose of this comparison and because those aged 45 to 54 
were not initially recruited in the REGARDS study, we included only 
people aged ≥55 years in both studies.
For both studies, risk factor definitions were standardized as 
follows:
• Hypertension was defined as sustained systolic blood pres-
sure (BP) ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg, history of 
hypertension (SIREN only), or taking antihypertensive medica-
tions before stroke.8,9
• Diabetes mellitus was defined based on history of diabetes mel-
litus, use of medications for diabetes mellitus, fasting plasma 
glucose levels ≥126 mg/dL (or ≥200 mg/dL if failing to fast), 
and HBA1c > 6.5%.
• Dyslipidemia was defined according to the recommendations 
of the US National Cholesterol Education Program as high fast-
ing serum total cholesterol ≥200 mg/dL or high-density lipo-
protein ≤40 mg/dL16 or low-density lipoprotein ≥130 mg/dL 
or triglyceride ≥150 mg/dL or history of use of statins before 
stroke.
• Smoking status was defined as never, former, or current smoker. 
In SIREN, current smokers were classified as individuals who 
smoked any tobacco in the past 12 months and included those 
who had quit within the past year. Former smokers were defined 
as those who had quit greater than a year earlier. In REGARDS, 
current smokers were defined by a positive response to Do you 
smoke cigarettes now, even occasionally? Past smokers were 
defined as noncurrent smokers who responded positively to Have 
you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?
• Alcohol intake was categorized into never or former drinker, or 
current drinker.8,17
• In SIREN, history of cardiac disease included myocardial 
infarction, rheumatic valvular heart disease, prosthetic heart 
valve, atrial fibrillation or flutter based on self-reported history, 
clinical examination, review of baseline ECG and echocardiog-
raphy.8,17 In REGARDS, cardiac disease was defined by base-
line ECG evidence of a myocardial infarction, self-reported 
physician diagnosis of myocardial infarction, or previous coro-
nary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, or coronary stenting.
• Obesity: Both studies assessed height (m) and weight (kg); 
body mass index (kg/m2) was calculated and classified as under-
weight (<18.5), normal (18.5–24.9), overweight (25–29.9), or 
obese (30+).8,17
• Physical activity: In SIREN, individuals were classified as sed-
entary if they were not involved in any form of physical exer-
cise (including walking, cycling, or gardening) or strenuous 
exercise (jogging, football, and vigorous swimming) before the 
stroke.8,17 In REGARDS, individuals were classified as seden-
tary if they responded zero to how many times per week do you 
exercise enough to sweat?18 All participants were categorized 
into 2 groups as no exercise and at least some exercise.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics including means and SD for continuous variables 
and proportions for categorical variables were computed. Differences 
in means and proportions were assessed using Bonferroni-corrected 
2-sample t tests and χ2 tests, respectively. All statistical tests were 
performed using a 2-sided level of α=0. 0167 after adjustment for 
multiple comparisons.19,20 Data management and analyses were per-
formed using MS Excel and IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, ver-
sion 24.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).
Results
Demographic Characteristics of Study Participants
The present analysis of 1928 stroke subjects included 811 IA 
recruited in the SIREN study, 452 AA, and 665 EA partici-
pants in the REGARDS study who had a stroke event. Overall, 
53% of stroke subjects were men, comprised 55.5% IA, 41.2% 
AA, and 58% EA with significant differences between the 2 
African groups and between Africans and EAs (Table). The 
mean (±SD) age at onset of stroke was significantly different 
across the 3 groups being 68.0±9.3, 73.0±8.3, and 76.0±8.3 
years among IA, AA, and EA, respectively (P<0.0001).

Stroke Types and Subtypes
Stroke was hemorrhagic in 27.0% of IA compared with 9.6% 
among AA and 11.8% among EA (P<0.0001; Figure I in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Among those with ischemic 
stroke with single pathogenic subtype information, frequen-
cies of cardioembolic strokes decreased in order from EA 
(45.7%), AA (33.5%), and IA (9.7%). Conversely, small-ves-
sel strokes increased in order from EA (21.0%), AA (35.1%), 
and IA (47.1%). Large-vessel strokes were more common in 
IA (43.1%) than in EA (25.4%) and AA (22.2%).
Risk Factors for Stroke
Hypertension was prevalent at frequencies of 92.8% and 
82.5% among IA and AA compared with 64.2% among EA 
(P<0.0001). Dyslipidemia was found in >80% of subjects 
with no significant differences among the groups. However, 
mean total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly 
higher among the 2 black populations compared with EA 
(Table). Diabetes mellitus was present in 38.3% and 36.8% 
of IA and AA, respectively, compared with 21.0% among EA 
(P<0.0001.) Cardiac disorders were more prevalent among 
EA (31.7%) compared with AA (25.0%) and IA (12.5%) and 
observed to increase with increasing age of subjects regardless 
of ethnicity with age-adjusted estimates (SE) of 29.5% (2.1), 
24.2% (2.3), and 12.0% (1.2), respectively (online-only Data 
Supplement).
Body mass index was significantly lower in IA compared 
with EA and AA, whereas physical activity rates was signifi-
cantly higher among IA (91.5%) compared with AA (62.3%) 
and EA (66.0%). Whereas only 2.2% of IA stroke subjects 
were current smokers, 18.3% of AA and 14.4% of EA stroke 
subjects were. Similarly, current alcohol consumption was 
lower among IA, 16.6%, compared with 36.1% and 53.8% 
among AA and EA, respectively (Figure II in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Ischemic Stroke Risk Factor Profile
The prevalence of risk factors for ischemic strokes among 
the 3 groups is shown in Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement. Diabetes mellitus was significantly more prev-
alent among IA (43.7%) and AA (38.1%) than among EA 
(21.4%) with ischemic strokes, respectively.
Hemorrhagic Stroke Risk Factor Profile
Age at onset of hemorrhagic strokes ascended in the order of 
IA older than AA older than EA. A male preponderance for 
hemorrhagic stroke was observed among EA (70.6%) and IA 
(60.7%) but not among AA (42.5%). Hypertension was pres-
ent in 90% of hemorrhagic stroke subjects of African ancestry 
compared with 56% among EA (Table IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement). However, there were no notable differ-
ences in the frequencies of diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia 
among the 3 groups for this stroke type.
Discussion
This study is among the first to directly contrast the char-
acteristics of the stroke type and risk factors between 
indigenous and diasporan Africans and to compare these 
Africans to EA. We found significant racial and geographic 
differences in predisposition to stroke and its subtypes both 
between stroke subjects of African descent and also between 
those of African descent compared with EA. Stroke subjects 
of African ancestry had significantly higher prevalence of 
hypertension and diabetes mellitus, comparable frequencies 
of dyslipidemia, and lower prevalence of cardiac disorders in 
comparison with EA. Further racial variations were observed 
in alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and physical 
inactivity, being higher among EA compared with people of 
African ancestry.
Stroke Type
In spite of the dissimilarities in risk factor profiles between 
stroke subjects of African and European origins, stroke types 
seemed to be more strongly influenced by geographic loca-
tion. The frequencies of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes 
were similar among AA and EA compared with IA. However, 
subtle but significant differences emerged in ischemic stroke 
pathogenic subtypes among the 3 groups. Small-vessel 
(lacunar) strokes whose pathophysiology is underpinned by 
hypertension and diabetes mellitus were observed at high fre-
quencies among IA and AA compared with EA. In the SLESS 
(South London Ethnicity and Stroke Study), small-vessel 
stroke was 2.6 times more common in black patients com-
pared with whites after controlling for risk factors.21 Most but 
not all previous studies have found an increased predilection 
of small-vessel stroke among blacks,21–25 and epidemiologi-
cal studies among black individuals in the United States and 
United Kingdom have reported higher frequencies of sub-
clinical markers of small-vessel disease including small deep 
infarcts and white matter hyperintensities.26–28 It is unclear 
whether there are ethnic differences in the impact of elevated 
BP on stroke risk or that genetic factors account for these 
differences.
Cardioembolic strokes were more frequent among EA than 
among African descendants probably because of older age 
of EA as reflected in the age-adjusted analysis conducted in 
the present study and the reported lower frequency of atrial 
fibrillation among blacks.29 We observed a higher frequency of 
large-vessel disease among IA in SIREN compared with AA 
and EA in the REGARDS cohorts. Other studies have found 
a higher frequency of intracranial large-vessel disease among 
blacks, whereas extracranial large-vessel disease was more 
common among whites.21,25
Hemorrhagic strokes were more than twice as frequent 
among IA than AA and EA stroke subjects reflecting the 
global trends in stroke type distribution.7,8 We observed that 
the mean systolic BP of IA with hemorrhagic stroke of 168 
mm Hg was ≈35 and 40 mm Hg higher than that among AA 
and EA, respectively, clearly supporting the notion that low 
levels of awareness and control of BP may be a key driver 
of this stroke type in low- and middle-income countries. 
However, whereas 90% of hemorrhagic stroke subjects of 
African ancestry shared the commonality of hypertension as 
the dominant risk factor for this stroke variety, only 56% of 
EA had hypertension, also suggesting that biological factors 
may be at play here as well.

Stroke Risk Factors
Consistent with findings from the GBD and INTERSTROKE 
studies,7,8 hypertension was the most prevalent vascular risk 
factor identified among stroke subjects, lending itself as 
a prime target for public health interventions particularly 
among subjects of African descent. Achieving and sustain-
ing BP control is a global challenge, particularly in low- and 
middle-income countries with substantial regional differences 
in levels of awareness and control of this most potent vascu-
lar risk factor.30 Again, we found a substantially higher preva-
lence of diabetes mellitus among stroke subjects of African 
descent, which agrees with data from the United States, where 
these 2 group comparisons (black versus EA) have been per-
formed.21,31–33 The higher rate of physical activity in IA may 
account for their lower body mass index compared with AA 
and EA.34 Rates of use of alcohol and cigarette smoking were 
significantly lower in IA compared with AA or EA suggesting 
an environmental effect.
A few limitations in our study are worth noting. The cur-
rent analysis was restricted to stroke subjects ≥55 years of 
age because REGARDS initially recruited subjects ≥55 years 
of age (expanding to the inclusion of those 45–54 approxi-
mately a year into recruitment). It is known that strokes 
among blacks (particularly IA) tend to occur at younger ages 
hence the risk factor profile explored in the present study may 
not be generalizable to subjects <55 years. Because of dif-
ferences in study design as a case/control study, the assess-
ment of risk factors was performed poststroke in SIREN but 
was also based on reported prestroke conditions, whereas as 
a prospective study, the risk factor assessment was performed 
solely pre-stroke in REGARDS. So, for example, part of the 
higher BP levels in SIREN may be attributable to poststroke 
increases in BP (compared with the prestroke BP levels in 
REGARDS). In addition, data collection in REGARDS is 
protocol driven where each of the risk factors was systemati-
cally assessed, whereas data in SIREN were clinically driven 
with greater variation in the approach. Strokes were defined 
in REGARDS using the World Health Organization criteria, 
whereas in SIREN, strokes were defined using clinical crite-
ria. As a longitudinal study, there could be changes in the risk 
factor status of participants between the time of assessment 
and the stroke event (averaging ≈4 years, with a maximum 
of 11 years). Nevertheless, differences occurring consistently 
both in IA versus EA and AA versus EA can be attributed to 
race and not study design or timing of assessment because 
the timing of assessment and study design are identical for 
AA and EA.
Conclusions and Implications
Race seems to play a major role in predisposition to vascu-
lar risk factors for stroke among subjects of African descent, 
whereas geographical location potentially influences stroke 
type occurrence. It is possible that the genetic ensemble of 
the 2 racial groups plays a greater role in predisposition to 
vascular risk factors for stroke, but ultimately, environmental 
factors modulate the expression of end-organ disease.
This finding needs to be explored further with genomic and 
epidemiological tools to unravel the precise genomic variants 
that predispose Africans to these unique vascular risk factors 
and quantify the environmental factors that modulate risk fac-
tor effect. Meanwhile, vascular risk factors to which people of 
African descent are predisposed should be targeted to control 
the burden of stroke in this population.
