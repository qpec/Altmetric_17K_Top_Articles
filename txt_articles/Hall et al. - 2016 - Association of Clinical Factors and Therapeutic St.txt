IMPORTANCE International studies report a decline in mortality following non–ST-elevation
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Whether this is due to lower baseline risk or increased
utilization of guideline-indicated treatments is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether changes in characteristics of patients with NSTEMI are
associated with improvements in outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data on patients with NSTEMI in 247 hospitals in
England and Wales were obtained from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project
between January 1, 2003, and June 30, 2013 (final follow-up, December 31, 2013).
EXPOSURES Baseline demographics, clinical risk (GRACE risk score), and pharmacological and
invasive coronary treatments.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Adjusted all-cause 180-day postdischarge mortality time
trends estimated using flexible parametric survival modeling.
RESULTS Among 389 057 patients with NSTEMI (median age, 72.7 years [IQR, 61.7-81.2
years]; 63.1% men), there were 113 586 deaths (29.2%). From 2003-2004 to 2012-2013,
proportions with intermediate to high GRACE risk decreased (87.2% vs 82.0%); proportions
with lowest risk increased (4.2% vs 7.6%; P= .01 for trend). The prevalence of diabetes,
hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal
failure, previous invasive coronary strategy, and current or ex-smoking status increased
(all P < .001). Unadjusted all-cause mortality rates at 180 days decreased from 10.8% to 7.6%
(unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.968 [95% CI, 0.966-0.971]; difference in absolute mortality
rate per 100 patients [AMR/100], −1.81 [95% CI, −1.95 to −1.67]). These findings were not
substantially changed when adjusted additively by baseline GRACE risk score (HR, 0.975
[95% CI, 0.972-0.977]; AMR/100, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.21 to −0.16]), sex and socioeconomic
status (HR, 0.975 [95% CI, 0.973-0.978]; difference in AMR/100, −0.24 [95% CI, −0.27 to
−0.21]), comorbidities (HR, 0.973 [95% CI, 0.970-0.976]; difference in AMR/100, −0.44
[95% CI, −0.49 to −0.39]), and pharmacological therapies (HR, 0.972 [95% CI,
0.964-0.980]; difference in AMR/100, −0.53 [95% CI, −0.70 to −0.36]). However, the
direction of association was reversed after further adjustment for use of an invasive coronary
strategy (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01-1.03]; difference in AMR/100, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.33-0.86]),
which was associated with a relative decrease in mortality of 46.1% (95% CI, 38.9%-52.0%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients hospitalized with NSTEMI in England and
Wales, improvements in all-cause mortality were observed between 2003 and 2013. This was
significantly associated with use of an invasive coronary strategy and not entirely related to a
decline in baseline clinical risk or increased use of pharmacological therapies.

T
here has been a global decline in the rates of death fol-
lowing acute coronary syndrome; however, the extent
to which this is due to use of guideline-indicated treat-
ments for management of non–ST-elevation myocardial in-
farction (NSTEMI) is not known.1-3 Randomized clinical trials
provide evidence for reductions in morbidity associated with
useofpharmacologicalandinvasivecoronarystrategiesamong
patients hospitalized with NSTEMI.4,5 With the introduction
of troponin assays, the detection of NSTEMI of lower clinical
risk has increased, which may account for improved clinical
outcomes in this population.6,7
However,thereisapaucityofcontemporarystudiesofsuf-
ficient duration and representation from a population per-
spective that enable a detailed evaluation of the association
of baseline risk and guideline-indicated therapies with mor-
tality among patients with NSTEMI.1,8-10 The Myocardial Isch-
aemia National Audit Project (MINAP) is the only whole-
country acute coronary syndrome registry, representing all
hospitals in a single health system (the National Health Ser-
vice of England and Wales) with prospective collection of de-
tailed information about quality of care and clinical out-
comes of patients for more than 15 years.11,12 Thus, MINAP
represents an opportunity to undertake phenotype- and treat-
ment-specific studies of temporal changes in clinical out-
comesforNSTEMI.Therefore,weaimedtoinvestigatewhether
temporal improvements in 180-day mortality between 2003
and 2013 were associated with changes in patients’baseline
clinical risk or use of guideline-indicated treatments for man-
agement of NSTEMI among patients in the UK National Health
Service.
Methods
Data and Patients
MINAP is a comprehensive clinical database of patients hos-
pitalized with acute myocardial infarction, mandated by the
Department of Health for all hospitals in England and Wales.
Data are collected prospectively at each hospital, electroni-
cally encrypted, and transferred online to a central database.
Data entry is subject to routine error checking and a manda-
tory annual data validation exercise. Mortality data were ob-
tained through linkage with Office for National Statistics death
records, which occurs on an annual basis. Further details of
MINAP have been published elsewhere.11
The analytical cohort was derived from all patients with
NSTEMIadmittedto1of247hospitalsbetweenJanuary1,2003,
and June 30, 2013 (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Patients were
eligible for the study if they were aged 18 years or older with a
final diagnosis of NSTEMI. The final diagnosis was deter-
mined by local clinicians according to presenting history, clini-
cal examination, and the results of inpatient investigations in
keeping with the consensus document of the Joint European
Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology.13
Patients who died in the hospital were excluded from the
study because it was not possible to accurately ascertain their
receipt of pharmacological therapies. Furthermore, patients
with missing postdischarge mortality data were excluded from
the analysis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the
statistical effect of excluding those who died in the hospital
(eAppendix 1 and eTables 2-4 in the Supplement).
Patient-level data included baseline Global Registry of
Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score (including age, car-
diac arrest, ST-segment deviation, elevated enzyme levels,
systolic blood pressure, heart rate, loop diuretic [substituted
for Killip class], and creatinine), patient demographics (sex, in-
dex of multiple deprivation), comorbidities (history of diabe-
tes, smoking, coronary heart disease, hypertension, myocar-
dial infarction, angina, peripheral vascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
easeorasthma,chronicrenalfailure[definedascreatininelevel
chronically >200 μmol/L {>2.26 mg/dL}], congestive heart fail-
ure, previous percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], coro-
nary artery bypass graft [CABG] surgery, and elevated choles-
terol level [defined as an elevation of serum cholesterol
requiring dietary or drug treatment]), pharmacological thera-
pies at discharge (aspirin, β-blockers, statins, angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor block-
ers, P2Y12 inhibitors, or aldosterone antagonists), use of an
invasivecoronarystrategy(coronaryangiography,PCI,orCABG
surgery), and mortality (through linkage to the Office for
National Statistics).
Ethical Approval
The National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Re-
search, which includes the MINAP database, has support un-
der section 251 of the National Health Service Act of 2006 to
use patient information for medical research without in-
formed consent. Ethical approval was not required under cur-
rent National Health Service research governance arrange-
ments.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics were described using numbers and
percentages for categorical data and means and standard
deviations or medians and interquartile ranges for normally
and nonnormally distributed continuous variables. For each
patient, the probability of 180-day all-cause mortality after
discharge was calculated using the GRACE risk score (range,
Key Points
Question Are temporal changes in clinical factors and therapeutic
strategies associated with improvements in survival following
non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction?
Findings In this prospective cohort study of 389 057 patients
from 2003 to 2013, patient clinical risk decreased while use of
guideline-indicated care increased. There was a significant
decrease in 180-day all-cause mortality from 10.8% to 7.6% that
was associated with increased use of an invasive coronary strategy
after adjustment for changes in clinical risk and pharmacological
therapies.
Meaning Invasive management may have been a contributor to
declining mortality due to non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction
between 2003 and 2013.

5-254.8; higher scores indicate greater risk).14,15 Given inter-
national guidelines, patients were categorized according to
their risk of 180-day mortality using their GRACE risk score
into lowest risk (<70), low risk (70-87), and intermediate to
high risk (≥88).5,16 Temporal trends of patient and treatment
characteristics were summarized by comparing data from
the start of the study (2003-2004) to the end of the study
(2012-2013) using χ2 tests, t tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum
tests. An ordered logistic regression model was fitted to
determine the temporal trend in GRACE risk score category
for each year of the study period, and results are presented
as odds ratios.
A series of Royston-Parmar flexible parametric survival
models17 were fitted to determine the extent to which phar-
macological treatments and an invasive coronary strategy (de-
fined as coronary angiography, PCI, or CABG surgery) ex-
plained the association between baseline risk and survival
trends. Flexible parametric survival models were selected in
favor of Cox regression models to overcome violation of the
proportional hazards assumption. Initially, a bivariable model
wasfittedtodeterminetheoveralltemporaltrendbyyear.Sub-
sequently, the statistical effect of the GRACE risk score, co-
morbidity, pharmacological therapies at discharge, and an in-
vasive coronary strategy on the yearly temporal trend was
determined by incrementally adding these data to the model
(see eTable 5 in the Supplement for sensitivity of the model
to order of model building).
Multipleimputationbychainedequationswasusedtopro-
duce 10 imputed data sets to minimize bias caused by miss-
ing data (eAppendix 2 and eTables 6-8 in the Supplement).
Pooled estimates and accompanying 95% confidence inter-
vals were generated according to Rubin’
s rules.18 Improve-
ments in model fit at each stage were determined by minimiz-
ing the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information
criterion ranges across all 10 imputations. The scale (propor-
tional hazards, proportional odds, or normal) and complexity
(number of degrees of freedom) for flexible parametric sur-
vival models were checked on the full multivariable model for
each imputation (eTable 9 in the Supplement). To assess the
potential statistical effect of clustering of patients within hos-
pitals, a sensitivity analysis was conducted comparing esti-
mates from a Cox model with and without the inclusion of a
shared frailty term (eAppendix 3 and eTable 10 in the Supple-
ment). To assess the potential for selection bias, an instru-
mental variable analysis with hospital rates of coronary angi-
ography served to approximate a random assignment of
patients to regional treatment groups that differed in their like-
lihood of receiving an invasive coronary strategy (eAppendix
4 and eTables 11 and 12 in the Supplement). In addition, a me-
diation analysis was conducted to determine the proportion
of survival trends that were mediated by pharmacological
therapies or use of an invasive coronary strategy in turn, while
adjusting for confounding variables (eAppendix 5 and eFig-
ures 3 and 4 in the Supplement).
All tests were 2-sided, and statistical significance was con-
sidered P < .05. Statistical analyses were performed in Stata
version 14 (http://www.stata.com/) and R version 3.1.2 (https:
//cran.r-project.org/).
Results
The analytical cohort (n = 389 057) was drawn from 441 945
patients with NSTEMI admitted to 1 of 247 hospitals between
January 1, 2003, and June 30, 2013 (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). A total of 31 321 patients (7.1%) who died in the hospi-
tal and 21 567 patients (4.9%) who had missing postdischarge
mortality data were excluded from the analysis. The median
follow-up time was 2.3 years (maximum, 8.4 years; 1 079 044
person-years). The median age for the NSTEMI cohort was 72.7
years (interquartile range, 61.7-81.2 years); 63.1% were male.
Typically, individuals had high comorbidity: more than half
hadhypertensionorwereacurrentorex-smokerandmorethan
a quarter had diabetes, angina, or previous myocardial infarc-
tion (Table 1). Overall, 82.9% had an intermediate to high
GRACE risk score, 9.7% had a low GRACE risk score, and 7.4%
had a lowest GRACE risk score. During the full follow-up pe-
riod, there were 113 586 deaths (29.2%) corresponding to 10.5
deaths per 100 person-years. At 180 days after hospital dis-
charge, there had been 37 236 deaths (9.6%).
Temporal Trends in Clinical Characteristics
Temporal trends in baseline clinical characteristics are shown
in Table 1. Over the study period, the proportion of patients
with NSTEMI who had diabetes, hypertension, cerebrovascu-
lar disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma,
chronic renal failure, previous PCI, previous CABG surgery, or
current or ex-smoking status increased (all P<.001 for trend).
In contrast, the proportion of patients with previous myocar-
dial infarction, angina, peripheral vascular disease, and con-
gestiveheartfailuredecreased(all P<.001fortrend).Therewas
areductionintheproportionofpatientswithNSTEMIwhohad
an initial diagnosis of chest pain of uncertain cause (21.3% vs
13.4%; difference, 7.9%; 95% CI, 6.9%-8.9%; P<.001 for trend)
and corresponding increase in the number of patients with an
initial diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome or probable acute
myocardial infarction (57.6% vs 72.8%; difference, 15.2%; 95%
CI, 14.6%-15.9%; P<.001 for trend).
Temporal Trends in GRACE Risk Score
From 2003-2004 to 2012-2013, the proportions of NSTEMI in
the intermediate to high GRACE risk category decreased
(87.2% vs 82.0%; difference, 5.2%; 95% CI, 1.78%-8.62%); the
proportions in the lowest GRACE risk category increased
(4.2% vs 7.6%; difference, 3.4%; 95% CI, −5.9% to 12.7%); and
the proportions at low risk increased (8.6% vs 10.4%; differ-
ence, 1.8%; 95% CI, −7.3% to 10.9%) (P = .01 for trend) (eFig-
ure 2 in the Supplement). During the entire study period
(2003-2013), patients were on average less likely to be at
intermediate to high GRACE risk (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI,
0.96-0.97 per year) (Table 2). This temporal trend remained
after adjusting for additional patient demographics, comor-
bidity, and pharmacological medications prescribed at hospi-
tal discharge. Over the study period, more patients who
underwent an invasive coronary strategy were in the inter-
mediate to high GRACE risk category (odds ratio, 1.01; 95%
CI, 1.01-1.02 per year).

vs 94.9%), and aldosterone antagonists (0% vs 13.7%) at dis-
charge increased (Figure 1). The use of coronary angiography,

Temporal Trends in Mortality
From 2003-2004 to 2012-2013, unadjusted all-cause mortal-
ityratesat30daysfollowinghospitaldischargedecreasedfrom
2.6% (95% CI, 2.5%-2.7%) to 2.0% (95% CI, 1.9%-2.1%) and at
180 days from 10.8% (95% CI, 10.5%-10.9%) to 7.6% (95% CI,
7.4%-7.8%). Over the study period, there was an absolute de-
crease in the adjusted mortality rate of 0.48 per 100 patients
(95% CI, 0.25-0.72 per 100), corresponding to an average 3.2%
relative improvement in survival per year (hazard ratio [HR],
0.968; 95% CI, 0.966-0.971). Figure 2 shows that the decline
in mortality at 30 and 180 days was greater for patients with
NSTEMI who were at intermediate to high GRACE risk than for
patients at lowest and low GRACE risk. In-hospital mortality
decreased from 10.9% in 2003-2004 to 5.0% in 2012-2013 (dif-
ference, 5.9%; 95% CI, 4.8%-6.9%).
Association Between Changing Risk Profile
and Improved Outcomes
The magnitude of the temporal survival improvements be-
tween 2003 and 2013 was similar when adjusted additively by
baseline GRACE risk (difference in absolute mortality rate per
100 [AMR/100], −0.18 [95% CI, −0.21 to −0.16]; HR, 0.975 [95%
CI, 0.972-0.977]), sex and socioeconomic status (difference in
AMR/100, −0.24 [95% CI, −0.27 to −0.21]; HR, 0.975 [95% CI,
0.973-0.978]), comorbidities (difference in AMR/100, −0.44
[95%CI,−0.49to−0.39];HR,0.973[95%CI,0.970-0.976]),and
pharmacologicaltherapiesprescribedathospitaldischarge(dif-
ference in AMR/100, −0.53 [95% CI, −0.70 to −0.36]; HR, 0.972
[95% CI, 0.964-0.980]) (Table 3). However, when use of an in-
vasive coronary strategy (coronary angiography, PCI, or CABG
surgery) was added, the temporal improvements in survival
were reversed (difference in AMR/100, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.33-
0.86]; HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01-1.03]), suggesting that this vari-
able significantly accounted for at least part of the reduction in
NSTEMI mortality between 2003 and 2013 above that of reduc-
ing baseline risk, increasing comorbidities, and use of pharma-
cologicaltherapies.Afteraccountingforuseofaninvasivecoro-
narystrategy,apparentbaselinesurvivalworsenedbyanaverage
of 2.0% per year. This result remained consistent in a sensitiv-
ity analysis whereby in-hospital deaths were included (HR,
1.020; 95% CI, 1.004-1.035) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The
finding that the increased use of an invasive coronary strategy
was associated with temporal improvements in survival was
consistent with mediation, which showed that 88.3% (95% CI,
55.3%-89.6%) and 9.9% (95% CI, 5.6%-10.6%) of this temporal
change may be explained by increased use of an invasive coro-
narystrategyandpharmacologicaltherapies,respectively(eAp-
pendix 5 in the Supplement).

Within the instrumental variable analysis, use of an inva-
sive coronary strategy was associated with a relative de-
crease in mortality of 46.1% (95% CI, 38.9%-52.0%) (eAppen-
dix 4 in the Supplement). Furthermore, the estimate of the
indirect contribution associated with an invasive coronary
strategy through the provision of cardiac rehabilitation was
small (3.6%; 95% CI, 3.0%-3.7%).
Discussion
In this prospective observational cohort study of the manage-
ment and outcome of patients with acute coronary syndrome
using data for all hospitals in a single health care system, im-
provementsinsurvivalfollowingNSTEMIwereassociatedwith
use of an invasive coronary strategy. Among nearly 400 000
patients with NSTEMI hospitalized between 2003 and 2013,
the temporal reduction in baseline acute coronary syndrome
risk, increase in comorbidities, and use of guideline-
indicated pharmacological therapies did not fully explain the
relative 3.2% yearly improvement in survival. As seen in in-
ternational registries, these improvements were significantly
and independently associated with use of an invasive coro-
nary strategy.19
International guidelines recommend use of pharmacologi-
cal therapies and invasive coronary procedures according to
baseline clinical risk.4,5 This is a result of robust evidence from
randomized clinical trials clearly showing that early interven-
tion in moderate- to high-risk patients is associated with bet-
teroutcomes.20-22Consequentevidencefromlargecohortstud-
ies across many countries shows a reduction in rates of death
followingacutecoronarysyndrome.1,2,23,24 Yettherewerecon-
cerns that improvements in outcomes were due to a lower-risk
population. That is, the introduction of a higher-sensitivity

a reduction in baseline risk of death.1 This study is one of the
first to our knowledge to describe at scale the high but decreas-
ing baseline acute coronary syndrome risk profile of patients
with NSTEMI as well as their increasingly comorbid status.
During the study period, there was a significant reduc-
tion in the proportion of patients with NSTEMI who were
given an initial diagnosis of chest pain of uncertain cause and
a corresponding increase in the number of patients with an
initial diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome or probable
acute myocardial infarction. It is possible that this was
related to the wider and earlier use of more sensitive cardiac
biomarkers.5 Earlier and more accurate diagnosis can lead
to more appropriate and timely treatment, including a risk-
determined invasive coronary strategy, with resultant
improved outcomes.5,28
Although the findings were consistent with mediation of
the reduction in mortality following NSTEMI by the use of an
invasive coronary strategy, the use of pharmacological thera-
pies prescribed at discharge offered little contribution to the
change in the full survival effects. However, these findings
should not be interpreted to indicate that medical therapies
have no role in management of NSTEMI. In the cohort, aspi-
rin, P2Y12 inhibitors, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and stat-
ins each had a significant association with improved survival.
Themajority(>80%)ofpatientsinthisNSTEMIcohortwere
at intermediate to high risk of death at 180 days. According to
international guidelines, those at and above intermediate risk
should receive an invasive coronary strategy; however, fewer
than half of those with NSTEMI underwent coronary angiog-
raphy. This finding is in keeping with the well-known risk-
treatment paradox whereby the highest frequency of treat-
ments were seen among patients in the lower risk category.29
Moreover, a series of randomized studies have shown that the

greatest benefit from an invasive coronary strategy was seen
among patients with higher-risk NSTEMI.30-32
To our knowledge, MINAP is the largest whole-country,
single-health-system, prospective observational cohort of the
quality of care and clinical outcomes across the spectrum of
acute coronary syndrome. It is designed to be representative
of the management of acute coronary syndrome in a clinical
setting and has standardized criteria for defining case mix and
treatments. However, there were limitations.
First, the study was reliant on accurate recording of data.
Second, MINAP does not collect all cases of NSTEMI. Third,
missing data could have biased the estimates. However, an im-
putation strategy to minimize bias was implemented follow-
ing a previous comprehensive study of the nature of missing
MINAP data.33 Fourth, it is probable that other factors be-
yond the hospital stay (such as drug adherence and primary
care visits) may also have influenced survival. Although data
on primary care visits or drug adherence were not available,
the findings were consistent with mediation analysis show-
ing that only a small proportion of the change in survival was
statistically accounted for by referral for cardiac rehabilita-
tion—a multidimensional program that includes exercise pro-
grams, dietary advice, and smoking cessation advice if appro-
priate; drug adherence and psychological counseling; and
follow-up for up to 3 months after NSTEMI.
Fifth, all-cause mortality was studied because cause-
specific mortality data were not available. This is a limitation
because noncardiovascular deaths may not be attributable to
NSTEMIcare.However,cause-specificmortalitydatamightnot
always be reliable for cardiovascular-related causes of death.
Moreover, most deaths within 180 days of discharge after
NSTEMI would likely be cardiovascular related. Sixth,
in-hospital deaths were excluded, which could have resulted
in survivorship bias. Nonetheless, a sensitivity analysis re-
vealed that exclusion of these cases did not affect the conclu-
sions drawn. Seventh, the definition of an invasive coronary
strategy included coronary angiography, which is a diagnostic
procedure. Earlier work using MINAP data investigated the as-
sociationbetweenuseofcoronaryangiographyandbetterout-
comes, whereby more than 40% of patients with NSTEMI un-
derwent PCI.34 Eighth, the results from this study could have
beenbiasedbyselectionofcasesandmediatedbyfactorsother
than those modeled. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to
quantify the potential bias and found that the resultant effect
sizeswereonlymodestlyreduced.However,theremaybesome
residual confounding from unmeasured factors. This study
found odds of death associated with use of an invasive coro-
nary strategy (odds of death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.48-0.62) compa-
rablewiththatobservedinrandomizedclinicaltrialdata(odds
of death or myocardial infarction, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.82).20
Ninth, this observational study cannot demonstrate causa-
tion, although adjustment was made for confounding factors
based on available information in the study data set and was
informed by external information from other studies.
Conclusions
Among patients hospitalized with NSTEMI in England and
Wales, improvements in all-cause survival were observed be-
tween 2003 and 2013 that were significantly associated with
use of an invasive treatment strategy and not entirely related
to a decline in baseline clinical risk or increased use of phar-
macological therapies.
