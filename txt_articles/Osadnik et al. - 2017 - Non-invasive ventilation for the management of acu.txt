Background
Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is commonly used to treat patients admitted to hospital
with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(AECOPD).
Objectives
To compare the efficacy of NIV applied in conjunction with usual care versus usual care involving no mechanical ventilation alone in
adults with AHRF due to AECOPD. The aim of this review is to update the evidence base with the goals of supporting clinical practice
and providing recommendations for future evaluation and research.
Search methods
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived from systematic searches
of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED),
and PsycINFO, and through handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. This update to the original review incorporates
the results of database searches up to January 2017.
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials that compared usual care plus NIV (BiPAP) versus usual care alone in an acute hospital setting for
patients with AECOPD due to AHRF were eligible for inclusion. AHRF was defined by a mean admission pH < 7.35 and mean partial
pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) > 45 mmHg (6 kPa). Primary review outcomes were mortality during hospital admission and need
for endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, treatment intolerance, complications, changes in
symptoms, and changes in arterial blood gases.

 Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria to determine study eligibility, performed data extraction, and determined
risk of bias in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. Review authors undertook meta-analysis for data that were both clinically and
statistically homogenous, and analysed data as both one overall pooled sample and according to two predefined subgroups related to
exacerbation severity (admission pH between 7.35 and 7.30 vs below 7.30) and NIV treatment setting (intensive care unit-based vs
ward-based). We reported results for mortality, need for endotracheal intubation, and hospital length of stay in a ’Summary of findings’
table and rated their quality in accordance with GRADE criteria.
Main results
We included in the review 17 randomised controlled trials involving 1264 participants. Available data indicate that mean age at
recruitment was 66.8 years (range 57.7 to 70.5 years) and that most participants (65%) were male. Most studies (12/17) were at risk
of performance bias, and for most (14/17), the risk of detection bias was uncertain. These risks may have affected subjective patient-
reported outcome measures (e.g. dyspnoea) and secondary review outcomes, respectively.
Use of NIV decreased the risk of mortality by 46% (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.76; N = 12 studies;
number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12, 95% CI 9 to 23) and decreased the risk of needing endotracheal
intubation by 65% (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.46; N = 17 studies; NNTB 5, 95% CI 5 to 6). We graded both outcomes as ’moderate’
quality owing to uncertainty regarding risk of bias for several studies. Inspection of the funnel plot related to need for endotracheal
intubation raised the possibility of some publication bias pertaining to this outcome. NIV use was also associated with reduced length
of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -3.39 days, 95% CI -5.93 to -0.85; N = 10 studies), reduced incidence of complications
(unrelated to NIV) (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.53; N = 2 studies), and improvement in pH (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.07; N =
8 studies) and in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) (MD 7.47 mmHg, 95% CI 0.78 to 14.16 mmHg; N = 8 studies) at one hour. A
trend towards improvement in PaCO2 was observed, but this finding was not statistically significant (MD -4.62 mmHg, 95% CI -
11.05 to 1.80 mmHg; N = 8 studies). Post hoc analysis revealed that this lack of benefit was due to the fact that data from two studies
at high risk of bias showed baseline imbalance for this outcome (worse in the NIV group than in the usual care group). Sensitivity
analysis revealed that exclusion of these two studies resulted in a statistically significant positive effect of NIV on PaCO2. Treatment
intolerance was significantly greater in the NIV group than in the usual care group (risk difference (RD) 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17;
N = 6 studies). Results of analysis showed a non-significant trend towards reduction in dyspnoea with NIV compared with usual care
(standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.02; N = 4 studies). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant between-
group differences.
Authors’ conclusions
Data from good quality randomised controlled trials show that NIV is beneficial as a first-line intervention in conjunction with usual
care for reducing the likelihood of mortality and endotracheal intubation in patients admitted with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure
secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The magnitude of benefit for these outcomes
appears similar for patients with acidosis of a mild (pH 7.30 to 7.35) versus a more severe nature (pH < 7.30), and when NIV is applied
within the intensive care unit (ICU) or ward setting.

Non-invasive ventilation for people with respiratory failure due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD)
Why is this question important?
When people have a severe attack of COPD, their breathing becomes very difficult. This can turn into breathing failure (acute
hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF)) that often requires urgent hospital-based medical care. One of the treatments that may be given
is breathing support (intubation and mechanical ventilation). This involves delivery of air and/or oxygen via a ventilator connected to
a tube inserted down the throat and into the lungs. This is undoubtedly a lifesaving procedure for patients with severe life-threatening
exacerbations of COPD, but it is associated with several possible unwanted side effects.
Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) involves delivery of breathing support via a ventilator connected to a nose mask or a face mask. NIV
is used more frequently nowadays to help such patients in many hospitals. This review aimed to determine the effectiveness of adding
NIV to usual care for this patient group.

 How did we answer the question?
We reviewed all available evidence up to January 2017 regarding effects of NIV combined with usual care compared with usual care
alone (involving no ventilation). Because up to 20% of people with COPD who have respiratory failure can die from it, we looked at
the number of deaths as the primary outcome. We also looked at need for intubation and time spent in hospital.
What did we find?
We included information from 17 clinical trials involving a total of 1264 patients. Compared with usual care in this patient group,
we found that NIV was more beneficial for reducing deaths and the number of patients who needed to be intubated. On average, risk
of dying was reduced by 46% and risk of needing intubation was reduced by 65%. Reviewers rated the quality of evidence for both
of these findings as ’moderate’ (according to GRADE criteria). People who had NIV spent an average of three and a half days less in
hospital than those who did not.
Conclusion
This review provides convincing evidence to support the use of NIV as an effective treatment strategy for patients admitted to hospital
for acute exacerbations of COPD and respiratory failure.

 B A C K G R O U N D
Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
particularly those with more severe disease, are prone to exacerba-
tions that frequently result in admission to hospital. Severe acute
exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) are commonly characterised
by development of acute respiratory acidaemia due to prolonged
hypercapnia (elevated levels of carbon dioxide). This clinical state
is known as acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF). Be-
tween one fifth and one third of patients with COPD admitted
to hospital with AHRF die in hospital despite the use of mechan-
ical ventilation support strategies (Ambrosino 1995; Bott 1993;
Brochard 1995; Foglio 1992; Jeffrey 1992; Roberts 2011).
Description of the condition
In severe COPD, hyperinflation places the respiratory muscles
at a mechanical disadvantage, and they function close to their
maximum capacity (Macklem 1984; Tobin 1986). During acute
exacerbations, elastic and resistive loads on the respiratory muscles
increase, and this may lead to ventilatory failure. Ensuing tissue
acidosis further impairs ventilatory muscle function, which leads
to the downward spiral of ventilatory failure (Jaun 1984).
Various methods of ventilatory support are available for the com-
promisedpatient.Conventional therapyaimstofacilitate adequate
oxygenation while treating the cause of the exacerbation. This is
usually achieved with the use of bronchodilators, corticosteroids,
antibiotics, and controlled oxygen. Traditionally, patients who do
not respond to conventional treatment would receive invasive me-
chanical ventilation. This mode of ventilation involves sedation,
intubation (insertion of a tube into the airway for breathing), at-
tachment to a mechanical ventilator, and transfer to an intensive
care unit (ICU). This treatment strategy has been commonly used
in clinical practice for some years and is associated with success-
ful reversal of hypercapnic acidaemia and recovery of breathing
function in some individuals. However, it is also associated with
significant risks. The intubation process may cause damage to lo-
cal tissue structures, and the course of ventilation may be com-
plicated by factors such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and
sinusitis (Fagon 1993; Koenig 2006; Waters 2015). Invasive me-
chanical ventilation in patients with COPD is also associated with
high morbidity and difficulty weaning from ventilatory support
(Brochard 1994; Esteban 1995). Prolonged length of ICU stay is
therefore not uncommon for this patient group.
Description of the intervention
Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an alternative management op-
tion for AHRF secondary to AECOPD (Bott 1993; Fagon 1993;
Kramer 1995; Meduri 1989). NIV allows provision of positive
pressure ventilation; however unlike invasive ventilation, NIV is
performed without the need for sedation and intubation. Instead,
ventilatory support is provided by a flow generator connected to
NIV via a full face or nasal mask. Advantages of NIV over invasive
ventilation include the ability to apply it for short, intermittent
periods (which may be sufficient to reverse ventilatory failure);
lack of sedation and its potential adverse secondary effects (e.g.
ventilatory suppression); maintenance of the ability to eat, drink,
and converse; and the consequent opportunity for individuals to
have continued involvement in decisions regarding their care. It
is important to note that the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia
observed with NIV use is less than that seen among intubated pa-
tients (Guerin 1997; Kramer 1999; Nourdine 1999). NIV is in-
creasingly used as adjunctive therapy in the management of acute
exacerbations of COPD. Therefore, it is essential that the effec-
tiveness of NIV as a primary management option is accurately
determined to verify its use in patients with AECOPD previously
characterised by greater reliance on invasive ventilation.
How the intervention might work
The mechanisms underpinning effects of NIV among patients
with AHRF are fundamentally similar to those supporting me-
chanical ventilation, that is, NIV works to enhance ventilation
by providing pressure-supported airflow to unload fatigued ven-
tilatory muscles. This enables recovery of function of respiratory
muscles of ventilation and facilitates normalisation of, or improve-
ment in, lung volumes and lung mechanics to reverse acidaemia
(Appendi 1994). Clinical improvement is most commonly deter-
mined via analysis of arterial blood gas samples and overall clin-
ical state. NIV is used increasingly in clinical practice and is an
established form of treatment for patients with a variety of chronic
hypoventilatory syndromes (Moloney 1999).
Why it is important to do this review
Use of NIV in AHRF due to AECOPD has been supported by a
number of case series (Brochard 1990; Foglio 1992; Meduri 1989)
and randomised controlled trials (RCTs; Bott 1993; Celikel 1998,
Plant 2001). Despite this fact, NIV is not more successful than
usual care inall casesof AHRFdue toAECOPD(Barbe 1996), and
failure rates of between 9% and 50% have been reported (Kramer
1995; Soo Hoo 1994). Factors that may relate to this include pa-
tient-ventilator dyssynchrony, the impact of coadjuvant polyphar-
macy for AECOPDs such as anxiolytics or respiratory suppres-
sants, and factors related to staff (e.g. time, expertise) and indi-
vidual patients (e.g. claustrophobia). A matter of concern is that
NIV, particularly when applied unsuccessfully, may delay the start
of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, thereby
potentially resulting in poorer health outcomes (Ambrosino 1996;
Wood 1998). This may be influenced by the common clinical
situation whereby patients with AECOPD find tight-fitting NIV
masks (whether nasal or full face) uncomfortable or claustropho-

 bic. Intolerance may result in poor treatment adherence and, ul-
timately, in NIV ineffectiveness. This is an update of a Cochrane
Review (Ram 2004).
O B J E C T I V E S
To compare the efficacy of NIV applied in conjunction with usual
care versus usual care involving no mechanical ventilation alone
in adults with AHRF due to AECOPD. The aim of this review is
to update the evidence base with the goals of supporting clinical
practice andprovidingrecommendations forfuture evaluation and
research.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We considered only RCTs for inclusion in this review. We did not
exclude studies described as ’randomised’ but lacking sufficient
information to reveal the adequacy of such methods. Cross-over
studies were not eligible for inclusion in the review.
Types of participants
Studies must have been conducted on adult patients admitted to
hospital with AHRF due to AECOPD. Studies of patients who
commenced NIV before hospital admission were not eligible for
inclusion. We defined AHRF by a mean admission pH < 7.35
and mean baseline admission partial pressure of carbon dioxide
(PaCO2) greater than 45 mmHg (6 kPa). If we could not ver-
ify mean baseline pH data, we accepted studies if investigators
stated within their inclusion criteria that participants needed to
have had an admission pH < 7.35. Studies of participants with a
primary diagnosis of pneumonia and of those with other underly-
ing pathologies were not eligible for inclusion. Studies involving
a mixed group of participant pathologies (e.g. some with COPD,
some with congestive cardiac failure (CCF)) were eligible if data
specifically pertaining to those with COPD were available or could
be obtained. We excluded no studies on the basis of the presence of
concurrent respiratory comorbidities such as obesity, obstructive
sleep apnoea, obesity, and hypoventilation syndrome.
Types of interventions
Studies must have compared effects of NIV versus usual care. Non-
invasive ventilation was defined as delivery of BiPAP when in-
spiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was greater than expi-
ratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). NIV may have been de-
livered via any type of interface (e.g. full face mask, nasal mask,
helmet). Usual care was defined according to trial authors’ defi-
nitions, which typically involveda combination of supplemental
oxygen, antibiotics, bronchodilators, steroids, respiratory stimu-
lants, and/or other suitable medical interventions (e.g. diuretics,
methylxanthines). However, usual care could not include any form
of ’usual’ NIV or invasive ventilation. Studies that involved par-
ticipants who had already received a form of invasive or non-in-
vasive ventilation (including continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP)) before enrolment, including studies of NIV weaning,
were not eligible for inclusion.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Mortality during hospital episode of respiratory failure
2. Need for endotracheal intubation (qualification for
intubation and mechanical ventilation criteria, as defined by
study investigators. If criteria regarding the need for endotracheal
intubation were not specified or could not be accurately
evaluated, actual incidence of intubation was accepted)
Secondary outcomes
1. Length of hospital stay
2. Length of ICU stay
3. Symptom scores (e.g. ratings of dyspnoea)
4. Treatment intolerance (e.g. participant unable or unwilling
to adhere to treatment owing to undesirable treatment effects)
5. Complications (NIV-related and those not related to NIV)
6. Arterial blood gas tensions one hour following
commencement of NIV (pH, PaCO2, partial pressure of oxygen
(PaO2))
Search methods for identification of studies

view Group. Details of these strategies, as well as a list of hand-
searched conference proceedings, can be found in Appendix 1.
See Appendix 2 for search terms used to identify studies for this
review.
We conducted searches with no restriction on language or type
of publication. This review update included searches conducted
in November 2013, July 2015, and January 2017. We per-
formed additional searches of three online clinical trials reg-
istries: ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov), controlled-tri-
als (www.controlled-trials.com), and the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) (refer Ap-
pendix 3). For search methods used before 2004, see Appendix 4.
Searching other resources
We searched the reference lists of included RCTs for additional
papers that might be eligible for inclusion in the review. We con-
tacted authors of included RCTs to ask about other published and
unpublished studies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors independently assessed studies yielded by elec-
tronic searches for inclusion in the review. We coded studies as
include, unclear, or exclude, according to the following criteria.
1. INCLUDE: Study clearly met all review criteria.
2. UNCLEAR: Study met some review criteria but available
information is insufficient to confirm eligibility.
3. EXCLUDE: Study clearly did not meet review criteria.
We determined final study inclusion by obtaining consensus of
two review authors using full-text copies of studies identified as
INCLUDE and UNCLEAR. We resolved discordance between
review authors through consultation with a third review author.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors independently extracted data from included
studies using a standardised template designed specifically for this
review. When data were missing, or when we were uncertain about
data presented in included studies, we contacted original authors
by email to attempt to obtain data or resolve uncertainty. We
included these data only if we obtained confirmation from trial
authors. Two review authors entered data into Revman 5.3.5 and
randomly checked accuracy. No review authors handled data from
clinical trials on which they were a named investigator.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane
’Risk of bias’ tool (Higgins 2008). This tool evaluates potential
for study bias according to six domains (sequence generation, allo-
cation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective
outcome reporting, and ’other issues’). Within this approach, we
specified the following four additional items considered relevant to
the context of the present review: imbalance among outcome mea-
sures at baseline, comparability of intervention and control group
characteristics at baseline, protection against contamination, and
selective recruitment of participants. We rated risk of bias as low,
high, or unclear for all domains and presented our assessment in
a ’Risk of bias’ table within the review.
Measures of treatment effect
We pooled for meta-analysis outcome data that were clinically ho-
mogenous. For continuous variables, we calculated mean differ-
ences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs). For dichotomous variables, we
calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs, as well as the number
needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) us-
ing the formula NNTB = 1/ [CER * (1 - RR)] (where CER =
control event rate and RR = risk ratio).
Unit of analysis issues
We analysed mortality, need for endotracheal intubation, treat-
ment intolerance, and complications as dichotomous data. We re-
ported all other variables as continuous data. We analysed mea-
sures of blood gas tensions for PaCO2 and PaO2 as mmHg, and
we converted data presented as kPa using the formula: mmHg =
kPa*7.5. As we anticipated the risk of treatment intolerance to be
very low in the usual care group, we evaluated data related to this
outcome as risk differences.
Dealing with missing data
We attempted to contact authors of included studies if data were
not readily available for analysis. We reported unpublished data
obtained from study authors in characteristics of studies tables.
We included only data on participants with COPD from studies
that comprised mixed patient conditions (e.g. COPD and heart
failure), if we could obtain the data.

 Assessment of heterogeneity
We performed meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model when pos-
sible. When outcome data demonstrated a ’greater than moder-
ate’ risk of statistical heterogeneity, indicated by an I2 statistic >
60% (Higgins 2008), we undertook analysis using a random-ef-
fects model.
Assessment of reporting biases
We explored the potential for publication bias in the meta-analysis
by generating funnel plots for the outcomes of mortality, need
for endotracheal intubation, and hospital length of stay, assuming
that five or more studies were included.
Data synthesis
We collated and analysed data from all trials using Review Man-
ager 5.3.5. We evaluated data related to primary review outcomes
as well as hospital length of stay according to the five GRADE con-
siderations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision,
indirectness, and publication bias) and presented this information
in a ’Summary of findings’ table.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We investigated the cause of any significant statistical heterogene-
ity (I2 > 60%) for any outcome on the basis of duration of NIV,
type of mask used to administer NIV, and risk of bias.
As management of AHRF may differ according to the severity of
the presenting condition and the hospital setting in which treat-
ment is provided, we specified the following two subgroup analy-
ses a priori and conducted these analyses for the primary outcomes
of mortality and need for endotracheal intubation.
1. pH: We compared studies of participants with initial mean
presentation pH < 7.30 (i.e. worse) versus studies of participants
with initial mean presentation pH between 7.30 and 7.35 (i.e.
better); and
2. Hospital setting for delivery of intervention: We compared
studies that applied NIV on a general ward (or in an emergency
department (ED)) versus studies that applied NIV in the ICU.
We defined hospital location in accordance with study author
descriptions (i.e. we employed no review-specific operationalised
definitions).
Sensitivity analysis
We performed a sensitivity analysis for our primary review out-
comes to evaluate the impact of studies that did not report out-
come data on an intention-to-treat basis. We believed this was
necessary, as anecdotal evidence suggests that some patients drop
out or withdraw from studies of NIV after randomisation and/or
upon initiation of NIV owing to discomfort.

An electronic search conducted in September 2003 yielded 697
citations: 602 from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register and 85
from Embase, MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and online respiratory jour-
nal databases. We obtained 10 additional references through bib-
liographic searching of relevant articles. On the basis of review of
697 abstracts, we identified 160 studies as potentially suitable for
inclusion. Full-text review resulted in exclusion of 138 studies and
preparation of a complete list of reasons for exclusion provided un-
der Characteristics of excluded studies. We included the remain-
ing 22 records from 14 original studies after identifying duplicate
records for Brochard 1995 (single), Dikensoy 2002 (single), and
Plant 2001 (six duplicate records).
We updated the review in April 2004 with exclusion of one further
study (Potena 2003).
An updated search conducted in September 2013 resulted in
identification of six additional appropriate studies for inclusion
(Carrera 2009; Collaborative 2005; Khilnani 2010; Liu 2005;
Matuska 2006; Samaria 2009), one of which was a more com-
plete version of the original abstract study of Khilnani 2002
(study ID changed to Khilnani 2010). We identified three Studies
awaiting classification because of uncertainty regarding randomi-
sation (Samaria 2013) and baseline pH status required to confirm
the presence of AHRF (Liao 2004; Servillo 1994). We attempted
to contact authors of these studies for clarification, without reply.

 We identified one ongoing study (Ongoing studies) via the clinical
trials registry search (Duan 2011). At this time, we removed a pos-
teriori from the review one study (Conti 2002) because we noted
that it clearly failed to meet one eligibility criterion (comparison
of NIV vs mechanical ventilation). The most recent updates (July
2015 and January 2017) yielded no additional included studies
but one excluded study (Kong 2015).
Included studies
Seventeen studies met review inclusion criteria: Avdeev 1998;
Barbe 1996; Bott 1993; Brochard 1995; Carrera 2009; Celikel
1998; Collaborative 2005; del Castillo 2003; Dikensoy 2002;
Khilnani 2010; Kramer 1995; Liu 2005; Matuska 2006; Plant
2001; Samaria 2009; Thys 2002; Zhou 2001. We provide full
methodological details of these studies under Characteristics of
included studies and summary details below.
Design
All studies were RCTs using a parallel-group design. We found no
cross-over studies. Some studies reported on participants crossing
from the control group to receive the NIV intervention as ’rescue
therapy’, but we did not include such data in meta-analyses.
Population
The included studies spanned various regions of the world includ-
ing Belgium (Thys 2002), China (Collaborative 2005; Liu 2005;
Zhou 2001), Czech Republic (Matuska 2006), France (Brochard
1995), India (Khilnani 2010; Samaria 2009), Italy (Brochard
1995), Russia (Avdeev 1998), Spain (Barbe 1996; Brochard 1995;
Carrera 2009; del Castillo 2003), Turkey (Celikel 1998; Dikensoy
2002), the United Kingdom (Bott 1993; Plant 2001), and the
United States of America (Kramer 1995). Six of the included stud-
ies were multi-centric, including Brochard 1995 (the only interna-
tional multi-centric study, conducted in France, Spain, and Italy),
Carrera 2009 (conducted in seven hospitals in Spain), Kramer
1995 (conducted in two hospitals in the USA), Bott 1993 (con-
ducted in three centres in the UK), Plant 2001 (conducted in 14
centres in the UK), and Collaborative 2005 (conducted across 19
hospitals in China). All trials included patients who had AHRF
due to AECOPD, but two studies also included patients with
other diagnoses. Kramer 1995 included patients with AECOPD,
heart failure, pneumonia, asthma, and pulmonary embolus, and
Thys 2002 included patients with acute respiratory failure due to
AECOPD and acute pulmonary oedema. For both studies, we in-
cluded in the review only data related to patients with AECOPD.
It is likely that participants in included studies did not represent
the full spectrum of patients with AHRF due to AECOPD ob-
served in clinical practice, as those requiring immediate intubation
were typically ineligible for inclusion in the clinical trials of this
review.
The number of participants in each included study ranged from
20 to 342 (median 41), with an aggregate total of 1264 (at the
time of randomisation) in the review. We could not determine the
precise number of participants who completed clinical trials. All
trials recruited similar numbers of patients for both study groups.
Available data show that mean age at recruitment was 66.8 (range
57.7 to 70.5) years, and males and females accounted for 65% and
35% of participants, respectively.
Interventions
All included studies compared NIV plus usual care versus usual
care alone. The precise nature of usual care varied slightly between
studies, but it typically included combinations of pharmacolog-
ical therapies such as oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, corticos-
teroids, theophylline, antibiotics, mucolytics, doxapram, diuret-
ics, and heparin. Variability in care was most likely attributable to
differences in the years studies were conducted and/or local prac-
tices within specific regions or hospitals. Six trials were conducted
in hospital respiratory/medical wards (Barbe 1996; Bott 1993;
Carrera 2009; del Castillo 2003; Dikensoy 2002; Plant 2001),
seveninICUorcritical care settings(Brochard 1995; Celikel1998;
Khilnani 2010; Kramer 1995; Liu 2005; Matuska 2006; Samaria
2009), one on an ’intermediate care ward’ (Avdeev 1998), and
one (Thys 2002) primarily in a hospital ED. We did not include
in location subgroup analyses data from this latter study (Thys
2002), and we could not determine the setting for two studies
(Collaborative 2005; Zhou 2001).
Investigators most commonly delivered NIV via pressure-cycled
ventilation (N = 21 studies). One study (Bott 1993) used volume-
cycled nasal NIV. Mean (range) inspiratory positive airway pres-
sure (IPAP) values used when NIV was commenced were 10.7
(3 to 20) cmH2O, but IPAP levels were frequently titrated dur-
ing early phases, according to the maximum level tolerated by the
patient or a target respiratory rate. The mean (range) expiratory
positive airway pressure (EPAP) value used upon NIV initiation
was 4 (0 to 5) cmH2O.
Nine studies delivered NIV via a face mask interface (Brochard
1995; Carrera 2009; Celikel 1998; Collaborative 2005; del
Castillo 2003; Dikensoy 2002; Liu 2005; Matuska 2006; Thys
2002), and three used nasal masks only (Barbe 1996; Bott 1993;
Khilnani 2010). Four studies allowed optional use of a face mask
and/or a nasal mask (Avdeev 1998; Kramer 1995; Plant 2001;
Zhou 2001). We could not determine the type of interface used
in the remaining included studies.
The duration of total NIV use was highly variable across included
studies. Studies typically implemented NIV according to protocols
that aimed to achieve a target number of hours of NIV use per
day (reduced from early to late admission), but the total number
of hours of NIV use was almost always individualised according
to the time needed for AHRF to resolve.

 Outcomes
The most commonly reported outcomes of relevance for this re-
view were mortality (N = 12 studies), need for endotracheal in-
tubation (N = 17 studies), and hospital length of stay (N = 10
studies). The outcome of treatment intolerance rarely included
adverse events in the control group, hence results clearly appeared
to favour usual care over NIV. One should consider this when
interpreting the quantitative findings derived from this analysis.
The extent of outcome data retrieved upon request from study
authors is provided under Characteristics of included studies.
Excluded studies
We have provided a full list of reasons for study exclusion under
Characteristics of excluded studies. The most common reasons for
exclusion were lack of a suitable control group (N = 5 studies) and
failure to meet the review definition of AHRF (N = 4 studies).
Risk of bias in included studies
We have provided in Figure 2 a summary of risk of bias for all
included studies.

 Allocation
Risk of bias due to selection procedures (random sequence gener-
ation and/or allocation concealment) was low or unclear for most
studies, and we rated only Dikensoy 2002 and Matuska 2006 as
high risk.
Blinding
Adequate blinding of participants to reduce knowledge of the re-
ceived intervention was rare and occurred in only three studies
(Carrera 2009; Kramer 1995; Thys 2002). Adequate blinding is
inherently difficult to achieve in clinical trials of NIV interven-
tions, as delivery of placebo care is challenging, and differences be-
tween active and inactive treatments are easily detectable. Knowl-
edge of the intervention group may have affected subjective pa-
tient-reported outcome measures such as ratings of dyspnoea, but
it is likely that most other outcomes were not affected. Much un-
certainty surrounds the adequacy of assessor blinding across in-
cluded studies. Lack of outcome assessor blinding may have af-
fected results related to several of the secondary review outcomes.
Incomplete outcome data
Four studies had low risk of bias owing to adequate completeness
of outcome data (Celikel 1998; Khilnani 2010; Plant 2001; Thys
2002). Four studies demonstrated high risk of bias for this item
owingtoattritionrelatedtoprimaryorsecondaryoutcomesand/or
failure to adopt an intention-to-treat approach for analysis (Avdeev
1998; Barbe 1996; Bott 1993; Carrera 2009).
Selective reporting
For many studies (N = 10), risk of bias due to selective reporting
of outcome data was unclear. We rated two studies as having high
risk of bias (del Castillo 2003; Thys 2002) and the rest as having
low risk.
Other potential sources of bias
We specified additional risk of bias items related to (a) imbalance
of outcome measures at baseline; (b) comparability of group char-
acteristics at baseline; (c) protection against contamination; and
(d) selective recruitment of participants, owing to their potential
to impact outcomes in the context of this review question. Studies
at high risk of bias for these items, respectively, were (a) Brochard
1995; Dikensoy 2002; and Matuska 2006; (b) Brochard 1995; (c)
Bott 1993; Celikel 1998; Collaborative 2005; del Castillo 2003;
and Plant 2001; and (d) Thys 2002.
For most studies, we identified no other sources of bias and there-
fore determined that they were at low risk of other bias. The risk
of other sources of bias was uncertain for the remaining four stud-
ies owing to insufficient information by which to judge this (Liu
2005; Matuska 2006; Samaria 2009; Zhou 2001).
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Non-
invasive ventilation versus usual medical care for management
of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to exacerbation of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (overall effects)
Mortality during the hospital episode of respiratory
failure
Twelve studies including 854 participants (Avdeev 1998; Barbe
1996; Brochard 1995; Celikel 1998; Collaborative 2005;
Dikensoy 2002; Khilnani 2010; Liu 2005; Matuska 2006; Plant
2001; Samaria 2009; Thys 2002) contributed data towards this
outcome. The overall pooled analysis shows a significantly lower
incidence of mortality among participants who received NIV com-
pared with those who received usual care. Investigators observed a
46% risk reduction (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.76; participants
= 854; studies = 12; I2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.1; Figure 3), yielding
an NNTB of 12 (95% CI 9 to 23; Figure 4). No publication bias
was evident in the funnel plot (Figure 5). One study (Barbe 1996)
reported no events in either group. Another study (Bott 1993) re-
ported mortality incidence as 3/30 for the NIV group and 9/30 for
the usual care group (not significant for between-group analysis);
these data refer to 30-day mortality. One study (Khilnani 2010)
demonstrated an effect estimate that tended to favour usual care
(not statistically significant); this study was unusual as participants
were characterised by very severe hypercapnia upon presentation
to hospital (PaCO2 > 80 mmHg in both groups). For this out-
come, we included from Collaborative 2005 only data related to
subgroups with pH < 7.35. We rated findings for this outcome
as showing ’moderate’ quality according to GRADE owing to an
’unclear’ risk of bias rating for several items (Summary of findings
for the main comparison).

Admission pH subgroups
Results for admission pH subgroups ranging from 7.35 to
7.30 (Barbe 1996; Collaborative 2005; Liu 2005; Plant 2001;
Samaria 2009) and below 7.30 (Avdeev 1998; Brochard 1995;
Celikel1998; Collaborative 2005; Dikensoy 2002; Khilnani2010;
Matuska 2006; Thys 2002) were significantly lower with NIV use
(RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.84; participants = 454; studies = 5;
I2 = 0%; and RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.90; participants = 400;
studies = 8; I2 = 0%, respectively). Differences between the two
pH subgroups were not statistically significant according to the
test for subgroup differences (Analysis 2.1).
Study location subgroups
Mortality was significantly reduced in the NIV group based on use
of a ward setting (Avdeev 1998; Bott 1993; Collaborative 2005;
Dikensoy 2002; Plant 2001) (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.78;

reported no events in either group. Data from studies conducted
in the ICU (Brochard 1995; Celikel 1998; Khilnani 2010; Liu
2005; Matuska 2006) showed a trend towards reduced mortality
that did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.34
to 1.07; participants = 251; studies = 5; I2 = 1%). Results showed
no significant differences between the two locations (ICU vs ward)
for the outcome of mortality (Analysis 3.1).
Need for endotracheal intubation
A total of 17 studies including 1105 participants (Avdeev 1998;
Barbe 1996; Bott 1993; Brochard 1995; Carrera 2009; Celikel
1998; Collaborative 2005; del Castillo 2003; Dikensoy 2002;
Khilnani 2010; Kramer 1995; Liu 2005; Matuska 2006; Plant
2001; Samaria 2009; Thys 2002; Zhou 2001) contributed data
towards this outcome. Results showed a significant reduction in
the risk of intubation of approximately two-thirds (64%) in the
NIV group compared with the usual care group (RR 0.36, 95% CI
0.28 to 0.46; participants = 1105; studies = 17; I2 = 0%; Analysis
1.2; Figure 6) with an NNTB of 5 (95% CI 5 to 6; Figure 7). Visual
inspectionof the funnel plotforthisoutcome raisedsome potential
for publication bias, evident by a relative lack of study data in
the lower right-hand quadrant of the plot (area signifying lack of
clinical benefit in studies of small sample sizes) (Figure 8). Barbe
1996 reported no events in either group. For this outcome, we
included from Collaborative 2005 only data related to subgroups
with a pH < 7.35. We rated evidence as showing ’moderate’ quality

 according to GRADE owing to ratings of ’unclear’ risk of bias for
several items (Summary of findings for the main comparison).

Admission pH subgroups
Need for intubation among admission subgroups with pH be-
tween 7.35 and 7.30 (Bott 1993; Carrera 2009; Collaborative
2005; Liu 2005; Plant 2001; Samaria 2009) and below 7.30
(Avdeev 1998; Brochard 1995; Celikel 1998; del Castillo 2003;
Dikensoy 2002; Khilnani 2010; Kramer 1995; Matuska 2006;
Thys 2002; Zhou 2001) was significantly less with NIV use (RR
0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.63; participants = 589; studies = 7; I2
= 0%; and RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.42; participants = 516;
studies = 11; I2 = 0%; test for subgroup differences; P = 0.16;
Analysis 2.2). Barbe 1996 (pH > 7.30) reported no events in ei-
ther group. Collaborative 2005 is represented in both subgroups,
as researchers reported specific data separately for each pH cutoff
threshold.
Study location subgroups
Among location subgroups, risk of intubation was significantly
reduced by NIV in both ICU-based (Brochard 1995; Carrera
2009; Celikel 1998; Khilnani 2010; Kramer 1995; Liu 2005;
Matuska 2006; Samaria 2009; Thys 2002) and ward-based sub-
groups (Barbe 1996; Bott 1993; Carrera 2009; Collaborative
2005; del Castillo 2003; Dikensoy 2002; Plant 2001; Zhou 2001)
(RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.43; participants = 401; studies = 9;
I2 = 0%; and RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.60; participants = 721;
studies = 8; I2 = 0%, respectively). No significant differences were
noted between the two subgroups (studies based in the ICU or on
the ward) regarding need for intubation (test for subgroup differ-
ences; P = 0.15; Analysis 3.2). Barbe 1996 (ward-based study) re-
ported no events in either group. Samaria 2009 involved delivery
of NIV in the ICU setting but usual care on the ward.
Length of hospital stay
Ten studies involving 888 participants (Avdeev 1998; Barbe 1996;
Brochard 1995; Celikel 1998; Collaborative 2005; Dikensoy
2002; Khilnani 2010; Kramer 1995; Plant 2001; Thys 2002) re-
vealed length of hospital stay to be significantly shorter for partic-
ipants who received NIV compared with those who did not (MD
-3.39, 95% CI -5.93 to -0.85; participants = 888; studies = 10; I
2 = 84%). We used a random-effects model for this analysis ow-
ing to significant statistical heterogeneity. Step-by-step removal of
studies suggested that these results were most heavily affected by
data from Collaborative 2005 (which included data pertaining to
19

 participants with admission pH ≥ 7.35) and Khilnani 2010. Ad-
ditionally, Bott 1993 reported the same median length of stay for
both groups (nine days). Despite several ’unclear’ ratings of items
for this outcome and modest inconsistency of findings related to
Collaborative 2005 (which tended to favour usual care, albeit non-
significant), we believe the impact of these factors in the large re-
view sample equated to downgrading of only one level according
to GRADE criteria, resulting in an overall evidence rating of ’mod-
erate’ quality (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Length of ICU stay
One study (Thys 2002) involving 20 participants provided data
for length of ICU stay. Although a non-significant effect favoured
a reduction in ICU length of stay in the NIV group (MD -2.70
days, 95% CI -6.79 to 1.39), this finding should be interpreted
with caution, as data were skewed but non-parametric data were
not available for analysis.
Symptom scores
Four studies measured dyspnoea via three different metrics (Borg
scale used by Avdeev 1998 and Barbe 1996; visual analogue scale
used by Bott 1993; and custom scale used by Collaborative 2005).
Data from Avdeev 1998 and Collaborative 2005 represent end-
point dyspnoea ratings (at 1 and 24 hours, respectively), and data
from Bott 1993 represent median symptoms over the first three
days of admission (not included within the meta-analysis). Data
from Barbe 1996 represent the magnitude of symptom change
over time. Pooled meta-analysis of these data via SMD revealed a
non-significant trend towards favourable reductions in dyspnoea
with NIV compared with usual care (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.34
to 0.02; participants = 484; studies = 4; I2 = 70%). This finding
was heavily influenced by Collaborative 2005 (71.8% weighting).
Plant 2001 reported a statistically significant reduction in time to
resolution of dyspnoea (median time 4 days in NIV group vs 7
days in control group; P = 0.025); however these data were not
suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis.
Treatment intolerance
Six studies involving 346 participants (Avdeev 1998; Barbe 1996;
Dikensoy 2002; Khilnani2010; Liu 2005; Matuska 2006)demon-
strated significantly greater (11%) risk of treatment intolerance in
the NIV group compared with the usual care group (risk difference
(RD) 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17; participants = 252; studies = 6;
I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.6). Plant 2001 noted that some participants
were intolerant of NIV treatment, but we could not ascertain the
magnitude of this estimate nor the direction of effect relative to
participants in the usual care group. Owing to the clear difference
between the nature of NIV and that of usual care interventions,
we expected treatment intolerance to be higher in the NIV group
than in the usual care group.
Complications of treatment
Six studies involving 567 participants (Brochard 1995; Celikel
1998; Collaborative 2005; Dikensoy 2002; Khilnani 2010; Liu
2005) contributed data towards this outcome. Analysis showed
that usual care had a significantly lower risk of NIV-related treat-
ment complications compared with NIV (RR 29.60, 95%CI 9.47,
92.51; participants = 567; studies = 6; I2 =24%). Owing to the
nature of this outcome, this result is to be expected. Two studies
evaluated effects of interventions on treatment complications un-
related to NIV and found significantly lower risks of complica-
tions with NIV compared with usual care (RR 0.26, 95%CI 0.13
to 0.53; participants = 125; studies = 2; I2 =29%).
Arterial blood gas tensions one hour following
commencement of NIV
pH one hour post intervention
Eight studies involving 585 participants provided pH data one
hour after initiation of treatment (Avdeev 1998; Brochard 1995;
Carrera 2009; Celikel 1998; Dikensoy 2002; Khilnani 2010;
Matuska 2006; Plant 2001). Data revealed a significant improve-
ment in pH with NIV compared with usual care (MD 0.05, 95%
CI 0.02 to 0.07; participants = 585; studies = 8; I2 = 73%). As we
detected significant statistical heterogeneity, we performed step-
by-stepeliminationof each study, which revealedthatAvdeev1998
contributed the most to this heterogeneity. Exclusion of this study
from the analysis reduced heterogeneity but did not meaningfully
alter the pooled effect estimate. Data from Dikensoy 2002 were
associated with very large confidence intervals for reasons that were
not clear from the original article. Caution is recommended re-
garding interpretation of the data from this particular study.
PaCO2 one hour post intervention (mmHg)
Eight studies involving 585 participants provided data on PaCO2
one hourafterthe startof treatment(Avdeev 1998; Brochard1995;
Carrera 2009; Celikel 1998; Dikensoy 2002; Khilnani 2010;
Matuska 2006; Plant 2001). The overall result tended to favour
use of NIV, but this difference was not statistically significant and
statistical heterogeneity was high (MD -4.62, 95% CI -11.05 to
1.08; participants = 585; studies = 8; I2 = 84%). Neither use of a
random-effects model nor previously defined criteria resolved the
heterogeneity. Step-by-step elimination of studies from the meta-
analysis revealed that Avdeev 1998 was making the greatest con-
tribution to this heterogeneity. Removal of this study reduced the
I2 statistic to 60% but did not fundamentally affect the pooled
effect estimate. We observed statistically significant improvement
in the magnitude of change in PaCO2 in Bott 1993 (MD 9.0,
95% CI 3.38 to 15.23; P < 0.01), but insufficient study informa-
tion was available for incorporation into the meta-analysis. Post

 hoc examination of findings related to this outcome revealed that
two studies (Dikensoy 2002 and Matuska 2006) had inconsistent
overall mean effect estimates relative to the others, and that each
study was at high risk of bias owing to imbalance of outcome mea-
sures related specifically to this outcome. Exploratory (unplanned)
sensitivity analysis involving removal of these two studies from the
meta-analysis resulted in an overall effect estimate that became sta-
tistically significant in favour of NIV use (MD -8.35 units, 95%
CI -14.84 to -1.86; participants = 491; studies = 6; I2 = 81%). We
have provided in the Discussion section of this review additional
details regarding these studies.
PaO2 one hour post intervention (mmHg)
Eight studies involving 585 participants provided data on PaO2
one hourafterthe startof treatment(Avdeev 1998; Brochard1995;
Carrera 2009; Celikel 1998; Dikensoy 2002; Khilnani 2010;
Matuska 2006; Plant 2001). The overall result revealed a statisti-
cally significant improvement in PaO2 favouring NIV compared
with usual care, but significant statistical heterogeneity was present
(MD 7.47, 95% CI 0.78 to 14.16; participants = 585; studies
= 8; I2 = 80%). Removal of Avdeev 1998 resolved this issue but
resulted in loss of statistical significance for the final pooled effect
estimate (MD 4.71, 95% CI -0.25 to 9.66; participants = 527;
studies = 7; I2 = 50%).
Sensitivity analysis
We identified four studies as being at high risk of bias owing to
attrition and/or failure to adopt an intention-to-treat approach for
analysis (Avdeev 1998; Barbe 1996; Bott 1993; Carrera 2009). As
described earlier, we found that Avdeev 1998 influenced the extent
of observed statistical heterogeneity in several analyses. Removal of
these studies had little effect on most of the primary outcomes, but
removal of Avdeev 1998 resulted in loss of statistical significance
for the outcome of mortality in the pH < 7.30 subgroup, with
a revised risk estimate of RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.06. Barbe
1996 delayed initiation of NIV for 12 to 48 hours, and other
studies started NIV as soon as possible. Removal of this study from
relevant meta-analyses had a negligible effect on outcome effect
estimates.

Summary of main results
Addition of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to usual care for man-
agement of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to acute ex-
acerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) sig-
nificantly reduces risks of mortality and endotracheal intubation.
Treatment with NIV is associated with a significant reduction in
hospital length of stay on average, but this finding relates most
often to patients with prolonged admissions. NIV appears to im-
prove acidosis within one hour of initiation. Results appear gen-
erally consistent across both intensive care unit (ICU) and ward
settings, and for patients admitted with more severe (pH < 7.30)
or less severe (7.30 to 7.35) acidaemia.
Interpretation of main findings
We included in the review 17 randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
involving 1264 participants. This represents a substantial increase
from the original review in the number of studies and number
of participants included. Trial results demonstrate clear benefits
associated with use of NIV as adjunctive therapy to usual care
(compared with usual care alone) for treatment of patients admit-
ted to hospital with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF)
secondary to acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). Benefits
were consistent across a range of outcomes considered to be clin-
ically important. Compared with usual care, the overall pooled
effect of NIV across included studies included significant reduc-
tions in risk of mortality and need for endotracheal intubation,
with the average number of patients required to be treated to de-
rive benefit in the magnitude of 12 and 5, respectively. Although
no clinical consensus has been reached regarding the most accept-
able number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome
(NNTB) for such outcomes, this approach appears to represent
good return upon investment with respect to the importance of
these clinical outcomes and the generally low incidence of adverse
events reported in studies included in this review. Effects of NIV +
usual care versus usual care alone across secondary outcomes were
derived from a significantly smaller pool than derived across pri-
mary outcomes and were less consistent. The magnitude of effect
observed among subgroups defined on the basis of admission pH
(< 7.30 or from 7.35 to 7.30) or clinical setting (ICU vs ward) did
not significantly differ for most outcomes, with the exception of
hospital length of stay, which demonstrated significantly greater
benefit for those with more severe acidosis (pH < 7.30) than for
those with milder acidosis (pH 7.35 to 7.30). This suggests that
benefits derived from NIV use are likely to extend across a range
of differing clinical scenarios.
Researchers have reported a significant 46% relative reduction in
risk of mortality with NIV compared with usual care. This equates
to potential avoidance of one death for every 12 patients treated
with NIV (aslightincrease fromthe original review(NNTB=10)).
This mortality benefit across the large number of included studies
is of considerable clinical importance. Debate has surrounded the
issue of whether NIV would delay necessary endotracheal intuba-
tion and therefore increase mortality. However, this position is not
supported by the findings of this review. Mortality with NIV was
reduced overall and across almost all of the pH and location sub-
groups, inferring generally similar responses irrespective of such
factors. The only subgroup that did not reach statistical signifi-
21

 cance for this outcome was the ICU subgroup (risk ratio (RR)
0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.07). It is noteworthy
to mention that this subgroup included the Khilnani 2010 study,
which was unique compared with any other included study, as the
mean admission partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) across
both groups was in excess of 80 mmHg. This would be considered
an indicator for intubation at many hospitals. Although this study
demonstrated significant improvement in arterial blood gases and
need for intubation, the mortality effect was small and non-signif-
icant (two deaths in NIV group due to septicaemia and acute coro-
nary event vs one death in the control group due to septicaemia).
In translating findings related to this outcome into clinical prac-
tice, it may be worth considering that the potential for mortality
in clinical practice could be greater than that observed in clinical
trials owing to factors related to patient suitability for mechanical
ventilation. Individuals who are poor candidates for intubation
and ventilation, including those with a very poor prognosis or a
low likelihood of satisfactory quality of life or prespecified end-
of-life choices (e.g. not for resuscitation/intubation wishes), are
unlikely to feature in clinical trials such as those included within
this review, yet may be appropriate candidates for NIV.
Need for endotracheal intubation was reduced by approximately
two-thirds (64%) relative to usual care, equating to just five pa-
tients needing to be treated with NIV to potentially avoid intuba-
tion of one patient. The magnitude of benefit was clear and statis-
tically significant for all subgroups, and no significant differences
were observed for this outcome across subgroups related to admis-
sion pH or treatment location. These data further demonstrate the
clearly important clinical benefits associated with NIV. It is worth
noting that findings related to this outcome could be considered
a conservative underestimation of the true effect of NIV due to
inherent challenges in evaluating and reporting this outcome in
clinical trials. Whereas failure of treatment for patients enrolled
into an NIV treatment arm commonly results in progression to in-
tubation and mechanical ventilation or withdrawal of treatment,
failure in a usual care arm typically results in escalation of medical
management to ’off-protocol’ NIV, followed by potential subse-
quent intubation and mechanical ventilation (or treatment with-
drawal). The precise incidence of ’actual intubation’ therefore is
likely to be less than the ’need for intubation’ in usual care groups.
Additionally, actual intubation rates may be influenced by the
availability of beds in ICU settings. Therefore we considered the
need for intubation as our principal definition for this outcome,
as we believed this more accurately evaluated treatment ’success’
versus ’failure’. Studies that reported only actual intubation rates
were not rated as having high risk of bias due to data contamina-
tion, as we believed this phenomenon was representative of clinical
care and was unlikely to overinflate effect estimates related to this
outcome.
Need for endotracheal intubation is not always considered a ’neg-
ative’ outcome, particularly in the context of treatment failure and
concerns regarding the timeliness of ’essential’ intubation and me-
chanical ventilation. Although this review did not set out to an-
swer specific questions related to such examples, some inferences
may be drawn from the present data (with due caution related to
indirectness of the data for answering such questions) on the basis
of lack of significant differences in beneficial effect estimates for
the need for intubation (and mortality) in subgroups defined ac-
cording to baseline pH levels. Although time to intubation was not
specifically examined within this review, the data should alleviate
some concerns regarding the safety of NIV as a first-line therapy
option (or trial of therapy for some) for patients who may present
later in the course of their AHRF (when concerns regarding time-
liness of invasive ventilation may be greater).
NIV use was not associated with exclusively positive outcomes.
Data from our review demonstrate the need for intubation criteria
was met by 66 of the 559 participants in the intervention group
(12% incidence; Analysis 1.2). Rapid access to teams and resources
capable of delivering invasive ventilation would therefore appear
advisable for individuals considered appropriate for escalation of
care when NIV is used. However, it is essential that evaluations
and judgements regarding end-of-life decisions are made for all
patients with severe AECOPDs characterised by AHRF on an in-
dividual needs basis. Although some patients with COPD may not
be candidates for invasive ventilation, a considerable proportion of
those who present to hospital with severe exacerbations requiring
NIV have greater underlying disease severity and, in the setting
of NIV treatment failure, may be more appropriate for attempted
continuation/titration of NIV, conservative management, or treat-
ment withdrawal. For example, patients who may have received
prolonged (> 7 days) intubation/ventilation in the past owing to
respiratory muscle atrophy may be characterised by reduced venti-
latory reserve and impaired capacity to clear pulmonary secretions
- features that are likely to recur during subsequent exacerbations
(Coakley 1992, Helliwell 1991; Le Bourdelles 1994). Other risks
associated with invasive positive pressure ventilation such as baro-
trauma, cardiac output impairment, increased work of breathing
related to dead space ventilation (due to length of the endotra-
cheal tube), and the potential for prolonged or difficult weaning
(Shapiro 1986) are relevant factors for consideration when treat-
ment plans for such patients are determined.
The findings of this review are intended to be interpreted with
respect to initial management of AHRF secondary to AECOPD.
Several studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness
of NIV in patients who are weaning from invasive ventilation;
we explicitly excluded these from this review and believe that our
results should not be extrapolated to such contexts.
It is noteworthy to reflect upon Barbe 1996, which was one of
the only studies to conclude that addition of NIV to usual care
was not beneficial. This trial adopted a less common approach to
delivery of NIV, as investigators delayed initiation of nasal NIV
by 12 to 48 hours after hospital admission (a period longer than
most other included studies) and administered it in two fixed
sessions (three hours per day). Most other clinical trials in this
22

 field, however, adopted flexible prescription practices, allowing
quicker initiation and longer duration of treatment in accordance
with participant responses (e.g. change in clinical condition). This
latter approach is more likely to reflect current clinical practice
in many countries where NIV is common. Removal of this study
from analyses did not meaningfully impact results, most likely
because of the relatively low weighting attributed to this (or any)
study, in the light of the large quantity of pooled data for most
review outcomes. This small study (N = 24) was also characterised
by a mild baseline level of acidosis (mean admission pH of 7.33)
at which significant mortality may not be expected to occur.
NIV significantly reduced length of hospital stay by more than
three days. It should be noted that the (weighted) mean length of
hospital stay for the usual care group was very high (17.5 days).
This duration of admission is far in excess of that commonly ob-
served in clinical practice in many countries (Chandra 2012). It
remains to be seen whether the magnitude of benefit would be
the same for patients admitted to clinical settings in which shorter
admissions are more common. This could be an important area
of future research. Only one study (Thys 2002) contributed data
to the outcome of ICU length of stay, limiting wider applicability
of this non-significant finding that tended to favour use of NIV.
The high incidence of intolerance in the NIV group was not sur-
prising, given that this finding is clearly related to the potential
discomfort of NIV in the NIV group and the absence of such dis-
comfort in the usual care group. Although this finding indicates
that NIV is not well tolerated by all patients with AHRF due to
AECOPD, care should be taken not to interpret this finding as
indicative of harm or a reason to deny a patient the opportunity
to receive NIV when indicated. When review authors explored
the incidence of complications, it became clear that most compli-
cations were related to delivery of NIV (e.g. mask-related facial
pressure areas, bloating) but were of a generally mild nature with
little long-term clinical consequence (Analysis 1.7). The two stud-
ies that reported data unrelated to NIV use described significant
benefits favouring NIV use; however, additional confirmatory data
appear necessary to verify this finding.
Four studies provided data regarding patient-reported ratings of
perceived breathlessness. Investigators used three different mea-
surement instruments (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Borg score,
and verbal rating score) at various times after admission. There-
fore, pooling of these data was difficult. Although we noted sta-
tistical significance for the single study (N = 60) using VAS, we
believe this does not represent any preferable sensitivity to detect
changes associated with NIV use. It makes clinical sense to ex-
pect that resolution of AHRF would be associated with reduced
perception of dyspnoea. Hence, although data for this outcome
appear limited in the extent to which they may apply beyond this
review, we believe that additional research is not strongly indicated
to vigorously pursue data collection for this outcome.
Acidosis has been shown to be an important prognostic factor of
survival from respiratory failure in COPD; thus early correction of
acidosis is an essential goal of therapy (Jeffrey 1992). This review
has shown that NIV (compared with usual care) achieves more
rapid correction of acidosis within the first hour. The collective
observed benefits of NIV for pH, PaO2, PaCO2 (not statistically
significant), and symptoms of dyspnoea suggest a picture of over-
all clinical improvement in respiratory failure status. Although
data presently available are not confirmatory, it is intuitive to hy-
pothesise that this clinical improvement may be a logical mech-
anism underpinning observed beneficial effects of NIV on need
for endotracheal intubation and mortality. A previous study using
NIV in respiratory failure secondary to exacerbations of COPD
(Brochard 1990), which was not included in this review (not an
RCT), reported reductions in respiratory rate and transdiaphrag-
matic activity with increases in tidal volume and minute ventila-
tion. These findings support the mechanism that NIV not only
rapidly improves gas exchange but also allows respiratory muscles
to rest, thereby reducing respiratory muscle work in respiratory
failure. NIV appears to optimise the window of opportunity for
respiratory muscle recovery and for other conventional treatments
(bronchodilators, oxygen, corticosteroids, antibiotics, etc.) to take
maximal effect. It is interesting to note that in the current re-
view, the outcome for PaCO2 did not reach statistical significance;
however, our post hoc exploration of this finding showed that it
was heavily influenced by data derived from Dikensoy 2002 and
Matuska 2006, both of which were rated as having high risk of
bias owing to imbalance of outcomes at baseline. In each instance,
participants in the NIV group happened to have statistically sig-
nificantly worse baseline PaCO2 levels before commencing the
intervention (despite randomisation). Endpoint data recorded at
one hour were used for meta-analysis, yet these values appeared
numerically worse in the NIV group than in the usual care group.
Inspection of the degree of change in both studies showed NIV to
be superior to usual care in both instances (NIV group improved
and usual care group deteriorated in both studies). This finding
may need to be interpreted with due diligence.
A specific point to consider regarding observed changes in blood
acidity levels relates to the unit of measurement for the pH out-
come. It is perhaps ideal to express changes in this outcome in
units of hydrogen ion concentrations (H+) rather than pH; how-
ever the latter clearly is used more widely and is easier to interpret
in the clinical domain than the former. pH is the negative log of
the hydrogen ion concentration; because of the logarithmic na-
ture of pH, one cannot assume that differences in hydrogen ion
concentrations between (for example) a pH of 7.26 versus 7.27
compared with 7.27 versus 7.28 are linear. Descriptions of mean
changes in acidity of 0.01 of a pH unit can therefore risk becom-
ing meaningless. As reporting of pH in clinical trials and clinical
practice regarding NIV use is far more common than reporting
of use of H+, we opted to report data in this more conventional
manner and do not advocate change. Rather, we encourage ap-
propriate due diligence in implementation of findings related to
this outcome, especially when stratification according to acidosis

 severity may be pertinent.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
We attempted to contact the authors of all included studies to
verify study quality and/or obtain additional data (as required).
Authors of five studies (Avdeev 1998; Bott 1993; Kramer 1995;
Plant 2001; Thys 2002) supplied requested information.
Quality of the evidence
We rated evidence for the primary review outcomes of mortality
and need for endotracheal intubation as showing ’moderate’ qual-
ity according to GRADE criteria. This rating was largely due to
uncertainty regarding risk of bias judgements for several included
studies. In the light of the relatively small weighting of any indi-
vidual trial in this large meta-analysis, the impact of such issues
could be considered potentially small, especially given the nature
of robust outcomes such as mortality, for which the threat of issues
such as performance or detection bias could be considered less.
Further research may impact the magnitude and our confidence in
treatment effect estimates, particularly for several of the secondary
review outcomes.
Potential biases in the review process
One should consider some important factors when interpreting
the findings of this review. One issue affecting data across nu-
merous secondary outcomes is the systematic bias associated with
treatment success/failure in favour of the intervention. Treatment
failure typically would result in loss of data collection for some
outcomes (e.g. arterial blood gas parameters measured after the
first hour of treatment), hence it is reasonable to suspect that ob-
served effect estimates may overestimate the true effectiveness of
NIV in management of respiratory failure for some outcomes.
It is also well accepted that no definition of an intensive care unit
has been universally accepted, and this has resulted in widespread
variability in the scope and context of such settings across the
world. The applicability of our subgroup analyses comparing ef-
fectiveness of NIV in ICU and ward environments was therefore
constrained by the definitions proposed by study authors. We be-
lieve this is the most appropriate approach for handling this issue.
Many of the studies included in the pH subgroup < 7.30 (indica-
tive of more severe acidaemia) examined NIV delivered within
the ICU environment. Similarly, most studies conducted in the
pH subgroup 7.30 to 7.35 took place in the ward environment.
Risk ratios for primary outcomes for subgroup analyses were not
significantly different. Therefore it is challenging to distinguish
between the relative impact of the severity of presenting acidaemia
versus NIV hospital setting on these outcomes. One could spec-
ulate the null hypothesis that little difference would likely exist
between subgroups, and that ICU-based studies and studies with
lower mean admission pH would do better with NIV.
Potentially relevant research findings might always be presented in
works that are not available for inclusion within a review or have
not been published owing to factors such as ’negative’ outcomes.
We believe our comprehensive search strategy was sufficient for
this purpose, as it included electronic searching of databases reg-
ularly updated through the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised
Register of trials (CAGR), including handsearching of respiratory
journalsandmeetingabstracts.Selectionbiasfrom the review team
was minimised by systematic extraction of data by two indepen-
dent members of the review team using standardised templates.
The extent to which bias related to clinical decision making for
study participants influenced clinical outcomes is difficult to ac-
curately ascertain. No study in this review could be described as
’double-blinded’ owing to the practical challenges associated with
such procedures; however Thys 2002 employed ’sham’ NIV. Other
studies ensured that research personnel responsible for making
clinical management decisions were unaware of which treatment
armaparticipantwasassignedto, until NIV hadcommenced(Bott
1993; Brochard 1995), or were not involved in decisions to intu-
bate (Celikel 1998; Kramer 1995), or employed a priori criteria
for decisions regarding intubation (del Castillo 2003; Plant 2001;
Thys 2002) or treatment failure (Dikensoy 2002; Plant 2001). It
is clearly important that interventions associated with a real po-
tential for serious adverse events (such as NIV) should have suffi-
cient monitoring in place and should provide appropriate rescue
therapy in the event of clinical deterioration. Although we would
like to assume that all patients who ’fail’ NIV would be offered
immediate alternative management (e.g. intubation and mechan-
ical ventilation), it remains possible that, in an unblinded trial,
management could be delayed to prolong the window of oppor-
tunity for clinical benefit associated with NIV. Variability in the
criteria used to define such treatment failure therefore has signifi-
cant potential to influence such outcomes. For example, Khilnani
2010 enrolled patients presenting to hospital with severe AHRF
characterised by PaCO2 levels over 80 mmHg in both groups.
This would warrant immediate intubation at many hospitals.
Finally, NIV itself has limitations. Some 13% to 29% of patients
are unable to tolerate the mask (Foglio 1992; Wood 1998), and
facial skin ulcers can be caused by mask pressure (Stauffer 1982).
Otherlimitationsinclude lackof directaccesstothe airways,which
could promote mucus plugging and/or atelectasis in patients with
excessive secretions, thereby increasing the risk of aspiration. NIV
initiation requires a conscious and co-operative patient and cannot
be done in patients with haemodynamic instability or life-threat-
ening hypoxaemia. No conclusions can be drawn regarding NIV
as an alternative to intubation owing to eligibility requirements of
this review.

pulmonary disease (Review)

 Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
A previous review evaluated effects of NIV added to standard
treatment for management of acute respiratory failure (Keenan
1997). The Keenan 1997 review, which analysed participants with
COPD separately, showed a strong survival benefit (odds ratio
(OR) = 0.29) and a reduced need for intubation (OR = 0.12)
in favour of NIV. Although our systematic review derived similar
conclusions as those presented by Keenan and coworkers, some
important limitations of this previous review led to the need for
the present review. First, our review included 17 RCTs, but we
included only three of the seven studies included in the Keenan
1997 review and excluded the remaining four studies for various
reasons. Ahmed 1992 did not compare NIV with usual care but
compared NIV with doxapram; Daskalopoulou 1993 used an in-
adequate method for randomisation (alternation); Martin 1995
included only a subgroup of participants with COPD and not all
participants met the inclusion criterion of PaCO2 > 45 mmHg;
and Wysocki 1995 excluded all patients who had COPD.
Second, we sought to implement a more comprehensive search
strategy compared with the one used by Keenan 1997, as index-
ing of MEDLINE alone is likely to miss potentially relevant stud-
ies. The strategy used in this review included electronic database
searches, handsearching, and inclusion of non-English studies.
Our current review includes only studies that were primarily set
up to compare NIV with usual care for management of respiratory
failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of COPD. The Keenan
1997 review set out to investigate NIV versus usual care in acute
respiratory failure due to various causes, including cor pulmonale,
respiratory distress, COPD, and pneumonia. The Keenan 1997
review conducted a post hoc analysis of the COPD subgroup.

Implications for practice
Available data from a large number of good quality randomised
controlled trials included in this review offer convincing evidence
supporting the use of NIV as a first-line adjunct intervention to
usual medical care for patients admitted with AHRF secondary to
AECOPD. This review had some risks of bias (e.g. performance
bias); however review authors believe that these conferred a rela-
tively minor impact upon primary review outcomes, particularly
with due consideration given to challenges associated with ’sham-
ming’ NIV interventions. Although it makes clinical sense to con-
sider implementing NIV early in the course of respiratory failure
(before acidosis progresses to a more severe nature), our data re-
lated to pH subgroups suggest that the intervention is no less ef-
fective as a means of reducing risk of endotracheal intubation and
mortality among these patients. We regarded the evidence sup-
porting a likely reduction in hospital length of stay due to NIV
to be of moderate quality according to GRADE criteria, and we
believe the magnitude of the impact related to this outcome is of
high clinical interest (particularly to healthcare administrators).
Previous research has shown NIV use to be no more costly than
management via intubation and/or mechanical ventilation, no
more time-consuming in terms of nursing involvement (Bott
1993; Kramer 1995; Nava 1997), and no more costly to deliver
within or outside the ICU setting (Kramer 1995), mainly as the
result of cost benefits associated with reductions in ICU resources
(Plant 2001). Data in this review support the use of NIV in the
ward setting; however decisions regarding implementation of such
therapy in different settings should be made with careful consider-
ation of factors specific to individual institutions that may impact
patient safety, including degree of illness severity and/or acuity;
availability and expertise of appropriately trained medical, nurs-
ing, and allied health staff for safe implementation and sufficient
monitoring of patients (e.g. frequent observations); adequate staff-
to-patient ratios; and appropriate access to and understanding of
different NIV interfaces and equipment (e.g. arterial blood gas
analysers) to accurately evaluate the impact of NIV upon a diverse
range of clinical outcomes.
Implications for research
An important issue emerging from the present review concerns
the feasibility of conducting future studies of NIV versus no NIV.
This is due in part to the clear benefit of NIV for a highly impor-
tant clinical outcome such as mortality and to increasing imple-
mentation of this intervention as part of routine clinical care for
patients with AHRF secondary to AECOPD. Therefore, it will
become increasingly difficult to define ’usual medical care’ without
NIV as a therapy consistent with evidence-based practice. This
may pose particular challenges in obtaining future human ethical
committee approval to conduct parallel-group clinical trials such
as those included in this review. For example, although future re-
search may reasonably impact and/or refine the precise estimate of
effect related to hospital length of stay, we do not believe this war-
rants future research employing control groups that receive usual
medical care without NIV.
One should interpret study findings within the context of the
specific questions posed by this review - which were limited to
issues of clinical effectiveness in the hospital setting. Additional
research would enhance our ability to more accurately select the
right patients and the right levels of ventilation (e.g. dosage, dura-
tion, mode). Studies are also needed to assess the feasibility, safety,
and effectiveness of NIV applied in different settings (e.g. out-
of-hospital, high-dependency units, non-specialist departments/
wards) and to evaluate the feasibility (if any) of using NIV as an
alternative to endotracheal intubation. Fewer data were available
for several of the secondary outcomes of this review (e.g. symp-
toms, length of ICU stay), suggesting that further confirmatory
evidence could still be needed to determine the impact of NIV on
25

 these outcomes. We contend, however, that targeting the primary
outcomes of this review should remain the primary focus of future
research related to clinical effectiveness. Outcomes not considered
within the present review include those related to quality of life
or to the diverse longer-term impact of critical (or near-critical)
illness survival known to significantly affect morbidity in the time
post discharge.
Finally, it would be clinically advantageous to identify optimal
monitoring strategies for patients with differing acuity levels (e.g.
extent of acidaemia) to guide evidence-based treatment decisions
for such patients. This may be particularly relevant for environ-
ments outside the ICU setting, where access to resources for moni-
toringclinical progress(e.g.bloodgasanalysis)maybe challenging.
It would also seem worthwhile for researchers to explore the utility
of emerging practices, such as expanded development of device
interfaces (e.g. helmets) and the increasing popularity of methods
such as transcutaneous carbon dioxide analysis or venous blood
gas analysis for patient evaluation owing to their relative simplicity
compared with arterial sampling. Research in these fields is still in
its relative infancy.

Methods
Country: Spain
Design: Randomised controlled parallel trial
Study site: Single site, University hospital in Palma de Mallorca, Spain
Method of analysis: Unpaired t-tests; 2-way ANOVA with Tukey adjustment
Aim: To determine whether NIV support with BiPAP facilitates recovery from acute
respiratory failure in patients with COPD
Participants
Eligible for study: Not stated
Recruited: 24 patients recruited: 14 in the NIV group; 10 in the usual care group
Completed: 20 participants completed the study (10 in each group), as 4 participants in
the NIV group were unable to tolerate the procedure
Age: NIV group: mean (SD) age = 70 (9) years; usual care group: mean (SD) age = 65
(13) years
Gender: All male
Criteria used to define COPD: Not stated
Inclusion criteria: Attendance at emergency department for acute respiratory failure due
to AECOPD
Exclusion criteria: Clinical or radiological evidence of bacterial pneumonia, pleural ef-
fusion, left ventricular failure, or nasal deformity
Interventions
Intervention description: NIV plus usual care. BiPAP ventilators were used with a mean
(SD) inspiratory pressure of 14.8 (2.18) cmH2O, and expiratory pressure set at 5 cm
H2O. Nasal masks were used
Control description: Aerosolised salbutamol (5 mg four times per day), IV prednisolone
(40 mg three times per day, later tapered on an individual basis), and controlled oxygen
via Venturi mask to keep SpO2 > 90%, delivered during first 3 days of arrival on the
ward (within 12 to 48 hours of hospitalisation)
Duration of intervention: NIV was given for two 3-hour periods (am and pm) for 3
days on a hospital ward. Patients were recruited to the study within 12 to 48 hours of
hospitalisation
Intervention delivery by: Adaptation to BiPAP was supervised by one of the study authors
Setting: Conventional hospital respiratory ward (non-ICU setting)

Methods
Country: England, United Kingdom
Design: Prospective multi-centre randomised controlled trial
Study site: Two centres in London (Kings College and London Chest Hospitals) and 1
centre in Southampton
Method of analysis: Paired t-test/Mann-Whitney U tests with exploration of differences
at baseline
Aim: To determine the effectiveness of NIV vs conventional treatment for patients
admitted to hospital with ventilatory failure due to AECOPD
Participants
Eligible for study: Not stated
Recruited: 60 adult patients (”approximately 10 in each group at each of the 3 centres“)
admitted to respiratory emergency department or ward
Completed: Data reported from 60 participants for some outcomes. Four participants in
the NIV group did not receive NIV: 2 were confused and unco-operative, 1 was unable
to breathe through his nose, and 1 had all active treatment withdrawn upon request
Age: Not stated. Participants just described as ”less than or equal to 80 years“
Gender: Not stated
Criteria used to define COPD: Not stated
Inclusion criteria: AECOPD, aged ≤ 80, PaO2 < 7.5 kPa, PaCO2 > 6 kPa
Exclusion criteria: Severe disease not attributable to chronic respiratory disease, severe
psychiatric illness, use of NIV at home
Interventions
Intervention description: NIV plus usual care. Volume-cycled nasal positive pressure
ventilation was started as soon as possible in the NIV group. Ventilation was provided
through a silicon nasal mask (Respironics, Inc., Murrysville, PA, USA)
Control description:
“Conventional treatment was that deemed appropriate by the clinicians responsible:
oxygen at 24 to 28%; inhaled bronchodilators; and all, or a combination of, antibiotics,
diuretics,respiratorystimulants, intravenousororal corticosteroids,and bronchodilators.
Patients were assessed and treated as necessary by a physiotherapist”
Duration of intervention: Participants in the NIV group received 7.63 hours (range 1
to 23 hours) of ventilation per day over 6 days (range 2 to 9 days). Control intervention
was provided until discharge: median (IQR) 9 (1 to 39) days
Intervention delivery by: NIV set up by a member of the research team who was not
involved in patient care. Usual medical team treated participants
Setting: Insufficient information to be certain. NIV appears to have been conducted on
respiratory wards, but may have been started in emergency department at some sites
Outcomes
Method of outcome data collection: Direct observation/participant data collection. Un-
certain how 30-day survival was measured
Prespecified primary outcomes:
Not clearly defined. Appears to be ABGs: ”Arterial blood gases were measured on ad-
mission, after 1 hour on allocated treatment, on day 3, and day 7, while breathing room
air (except at 1 h after admission, when the patient was using either oxygen or NIV“
Prespecified secondary outcomes:
“VAS scores for shortness of breath, well-being, and quality of sleep were obtained from
the patients; and nursing care requirements from a senior nurse, daily until day 3, and
then on day 7. FEV1, FVC, and peak expiratory flow rate were measured during the
hospital stay”. Mortality and intubation were also reported

Exclusion criteria: Presence of any of the following: RR < 12 breaths/min; need for imme-
diate intubation; tracheotomy or endotracheal intubation performed before admission;
sedative drugs administered in previous 12 hours; central nervous system disorder unre-
lated to hypercapnic encephalopathy or hypoxaemia; cardiac arrest in past 5 days; cardio-

surgery or trauma); facial deformity; or enrolment in other investigative protocols. In
addition, patients who refused to undergo endotracheal intubation, whatever the initial
therapeutic approach, were excluded from the study
Interventions
Intervention description: usual care plus NIV via ARM 25 (Taema, Antony, France)
. This flow-triggered system provides constant pressure during inspiration and a rapid
pressurisation rate (flow rates 10 to 35 L/min). Pressure support was initiated at 20
cmH2O, but no EPAP/PEEP (atmospheric only). Pressure support was initiated at 20
cm H2O, but no EPAP/PEEP (atmospheric only). Oxygen was incorporated to maintain
saturations > 90%
Investigators used specially developed face masks that included a foam internal lining to
decrease dead space
Control description: Oxygen (max 5 L/min via nasal prongs) to achieve arterial oxygen
saturation > 90%; subcutaneous heparin, antibiotic agents, and bronchodilators (sub-
cutaneous terbutaline, aerosolised and intravenous albuterol, and corticosteroids or in-
travenous aminophylline or both), plus correction of electrolyte abnormalities
Duration of intervention: Participants underwent NIV for at least 6 hours each day. The
period could be lengthened, depending on patient tolerance. Participants were allowed
to breathe spontaneously (with oxygen but with no assistance) each day for 2 hours.
Overall NIV duration was based upon clinical criteria and ABG levels at the discretion
of the physician in charge
Intervention delivery by: Not stated
Setting: NIV was conducted in ICU
Outcomes
Method of outcome data collection: Not stated
Prespecified primary outcomes: Need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ven-
tilation at any time during the study
Prespecified secondary outcomes: Hospital length of stay, complications not present
upon admission (e.g. pneumonia, barotrauma, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, renal in-
sufficiency, neurological events, and pulmonary embolism), duration of ventilatory as-
sistance, and in-hospital mortality. Data also reported on encephalopathy score and loss
to follow-up
Follow-up period: Respiratory rate, encephalopathy score, and ABG analyses were per-
formed 1, 3, and 12 hours after start of treatment, then daily until ICU discharge. SAPS
was calculated at 24 hours. PFTs were performed before discharge, when possible, or
within 3 months after discharge

Methods
Country: Spain
Design: Prospective multi-centre double-blind randomised controlled trial
Study site: 7 tertiary hospitals
Method of analysis: Results are shown as mean ± SD. Continuous and categorical vari-
ables were compared by Student t-test and Chi2 test. Two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between groups
and over time. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Length of hos-
pital stay data were not normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), thus Mann-
Whitney U test was performed, and median to represent central measurement of the
sample and dispersion was represented as percentiles
Aim: To determine whether NIV reduces the need for endotracheal intubation and
enhances recovery in patients hospitalised owing to AECOPD
Participants
Eligible for study: Not reported
Recruited: 75 patients with AECOPD were recruited from emergency department of 7
tertiary hospitals in Spain: 37 were randomised to NIV group and 38 to control group
with sham NIV
Completed: 32 participants in NIV group completed study and 5 met intubation criteria
(3 were intubated and 2 were continued on NIV off protocol), whereas 25 participants
in control group completed the study and 13 met intubation criteria (4 were intubated,
7 were offered NIV, and 2 continued with medical therapy)
Age: NIV group: mean (SD) age = 72 (10) years; usual care group: mean (SD) age = 69
(7) years
Gender: Not stated
Criteria used to define COPD: Not mentioned
Inclusion criteria: previous known diagnosis of COPD (not defined by study authors)
, with symptoms of increasing dyspnoea, cough, and/or sputum production of recent
onset (last 2 weeks) in the absence of an alternate diagnosis that leads the attending
physician at the emergency department to diagnose AECOPD of sufficient severity as to
require hospitalisation according to the following criteria: arterial pH < 7.35 and PaCO2
> 50 mmHg 30 to 60 minutes after intensive medical management (bronchodilator,
steroids, oxygen). Recruitment occurred within 24 hours after admission
Exclusion criteria:
Respiratory rate < 12 bpm or need for immediate intubation for cardiopulmonary re-
suscitation; arterial pH < 7.25; GCS > 8; administration of sedative drugs within previ-
ous 12 hours; neuromuscular disorders; thoracoplasty or kyphoscoliosis; known cause of
decompensation requiring specific treatment (pneumothorax, haemoptysis, pneumonia,
etc.); medical history of sleep apnoea, asthma, or any severe systemic disease; BMI > 40;
facial deformity; history of acute episodes that required NIV treatment; long-term NIV
treatment; history of drug and alcohol abuse or refusal to participate
Interventions
Intervention description:
Intervention delivered via NIV; all centres used same BiPAP and facial mask models
(Respironics, Inc., Murrysville, PA, USA). EPAP was set at 4 cmH2O, whereas IPAP
was adjusted individually to the maximum tolerated (to achieve alleviation of dyspnoea,
decreased respiratory rate, and good patient-ventilator synchrony) in assisted/controlled
mode. All participants received conventional treatment with supplementary oxygen to
maintain SpO2 ≥ 90%, bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics
Control description:
Sham NIV was delivered via a modified commercially available BiPAP (Respironics, Inc.

, Murrysville, PA, USA) to provide only controlled oxygen therapy without inspiratory
pressure support. To dissipate pressure generated by the machine, investigators drilled a
hole in the tube that connects the pressure generator to the patient mask and controlled
FiO2 with the oxygen line through this hole, connected to a facial mask of the standard
Venturi regulator (Kendall Proclinics, Barcelona, Spain). Sham device was validated and
ABGs were indistinguishable from those obtained when a standard Venturi mask was
used. All participants received conventional treatment with bronchodilators, steroids,
and antibiotics
Duration of intervention: First 3 days of hospitalisation for as much time as possible
between 3 pm and 8 am for both NIV and sham NIV
Intervention delivery by:
In the morning (8 am to 3 pm), a respiratory specialist recruited participants and pre-
scribed standard treatment and oxygen. The same physician visited the participant every
morning (while patient was off ventilator), decided on treatment modifications, and set
the timing for discharge. This physician was not involved in participant care after 3 pm
From 3 pm to 8 am, a study investigator (respiratory physician) with experience in NIV,
familiar with the BiPAP
, who was totally independent of participant care, added BiPAP
or sham BiPAP according to the randomisation scheme, and removed device from the
room before 8 am the next morning
Both NIVs were discontinued on day 4 of hospitalisation
Setting: Respiratory ward
Outcomes
Method of outcome data collection:
ABG, GCS, force spirometry at discharge, respiratory rate, heart rate, dyspnoea (visual
analogue dyspnoea scale). These variables were recorded at inclusion, 1 hour after NIV,
and at day 1, day 2, and day 3
Prespecified primary outcomes:
Need for endotracheal intubation with presence of 1 or more of the following criteria:
cardiorespiratoryarrest,arterial pH<7.20after30 minutesonoptimal medical treatment
or pH between 7.20 and 7.25 on 2 occasions 1 hour apart, pO2 < 45 mmHg despite
maximum tolerated oxygen therapy, hypercapnic coma (GCS < 8). Patient fulfilling these
criteria were considered failures and were excluded from the study and managed on an
open-label basis and off protocol
Prespecified secondary outcomes:
Speed of recovery of ABG and length of hospital stay
Follow-up period: From admission until discharge; precise number of follow-up time
points not clearly mentioned
Notes
Primary outcome was need for intubation, not actual intubation. Some participants
provided with successful rescue therapy

tralised interactive voice system
Study site: 19 teaching hospitals in China; general ward setting
Methods of analysis: A 2-tailed unpaired test with P = 0.05. Results are given as mean
± standard deviation (SD). Means were compared by unpaired t-test or 1-way analysis
of variance. Chi2 test was used for rate of intubation and in-hospital mortality. Analyses
were done by SPSS 10.0
Aim: To evaluate outcomes of AECOPD if NIV is administered within 24 to 48 hours of
admission to patients with respiratory muscle fatigue and mild respiratory insufficiency,
especiallythose notfulfillingthe conventional criterionof mechanical ventilatorysupport
Participants
Eligible for study: 342 patients with AECOPD, age < 85 years, pH > 7.25, and PCO2
> 45 mmHg on arrival to the general ward were enrolled within 24 to 48 hours of
admission
Recruited: N = 342; n = 171 for intervention; n = 171 for control
Completed: Intervention group: All completed the study: 8 participants required in-
tubation (including 5 deaths) and 161 were discharged (2 deaths). Control group: 26
required intubation (including 12 deaths) and 145 were discharged
Age: Intervention group: 69 ± 10 years. Control group: 70 ± 8 years
Gender: Intervention group: 113 males, 58 females. Control group: 99 males, 72 females
Criteria used to define COPD: Definitive or highly probable COPD based on clinical
history, physical examination, CXR, spirometry, and ABGs. AECOPD was characterised
by an exacerbation of dyspnoea, cough and increased sputum production, and changes
in CXR
Exclusion criteria: refused to receive NIV, pH < 7.25, GCS < 8, airway or facial deformity,
pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum, unable to spontaneously clear secretions from the
airway, SBP < 90 mmHg, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, unable to co-operate with
application of NIV, severe organ dysfunction (APO, GI bleed, DIC, hepatic and renal
dysfunction)
Interventions
Intervention description: All centres used the same apparatus to deliver NIV (Harmony,
Respironics, Inc., or BiBAP S/T30, Respironics, Inc., Murrysville, PA, USA) with an
oronasal mask. Pressure support ventilation was initially delivered with EPAP of 2 to
4 cmH2O and IPAP of 6 to 8 cmH2O. EPAP was increased gradually to 4 to 6 cm
H2O. IPAP was adjusted in increments of 2 cm H2O every 5 to 6 minutes to obtain
a satisfactory spontaneous breathing pattern, or with maximal tolerated value for each

Methods
Country: United States
Design: Randomised controlled trial, prospective design
Study site: Conducted between October 1992 and June 1993 at Rhode Island Hospital
and Roger Williams Medical Centre - both teaching affiliates of Brown University School
of Medicine (Providence, RI, USA)
Methods of analysis: Demographic and baseline data and continuous variables were
compared between groups using unpaired t-tests. Needfor intubation and mortality rates
were compared using Chi2 test with continuity correction for 2 by 2 tables. Differences
were considered significant at P < 0.05. Data were presented as mean ± SE
Aim: To test the hypotheses that, in patients with acute respiratory failure who are oth-
erwise stable, NIV reduces the need for endotracheal intubation; more rapidly improves
respiratory frequency, heart rate, and sense of dyspnoea; and shortens length of hospi-
talisation in comparison with standard therapy alone
Participants
Eligible for study: 31 patients with acute respiratory failure: 16 in the NIV group and 15
in the control group. Included patients with COPD, heart failure, pneumonia, asthma,
and pulmonary embolus
Recruited: 23 patients with COPD were recruited: 11 in the NIV group and 12 in the
usual care group
Completed: Not clearly described
Age: No COPD-specific data available
Gender: No COPD-specific data available
Criteria to define COPD: Not stated
Inclusion criteria: Patients with COPD in respiratory distress: moderate to severe dysp-
noea, accessory muscle use or abdominal paradox and acute respiratory failure with pH
< 7.35, PaCO2 > 45 mmHg, and RR > 24 bpm
Exclusion criteria: respiratory arrest or need for immediate intubation; hypotension (SBP
< 90 mmHg); uncontrolled arrhythmias; upper airway obstruction or facial trauma;
inability to clear secretions; inability to co-operate or fit mask
Interventions
Intervention description: All participants were first fitted with a nasal mask, however this
was substituted with an oronasal mask if participant intolerant or excessive air leak. NIV
was administered using a BiPAP ventilator assist system (Respironics, Inc,, Murrysville,
PA, USA), a pressure-limited device that cycles between adjustable (up to 20 cmH2O)
inspiratory and expiratory pressure using S or T modes. The S/T mode was used for
this study. Ventilation was initiated with a backup rate of 12 breaths/min. IPAP was
set at 8 cmH2O initially, and EPAP was set at the lowest possible setting (~2 cmH2O).
Oxygen was blended in via a mask port to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90%. IPAP was increased
by 1 cmH2O every 15 to 30 minutes or as tolerated. Subsequent adjustment in IPAP if
ABG showed persistent respiratory acidosis or clinical evidence of continued respiratory
distress
All participants also received corticosteroids, frequent respiratory treatments, supple-
mental oxygen, and antibiotics
Control description: Corticosteroids, frequent respiratory treatments, supplemental oxy-
gen, and antibiotics. Control participants who declined intubation were offered a trial
of NIV if their condition deteriorated sufficiently to warrant intubation and if they were
considered to have needed intubation for purposes of analysis
Duration of intervention: Encouraged to use NIV as long as tolerated, aiming for at least
8 hours per day. Weaning no sooner than 6 hours after initiation of NIV once clinical

Methods
Country: United Kingdom
Design: Multi-centre prospective randomised controlled trial. Randomisation via a
blocked design to each centre and generated by an independent statistician who used
random numbers
Study site: 14 tertiary hospitals in the UK between November 1996 and September 1998
Setting: General medical/respiratory wards with no invasive monitoring. 22 wards had
no experience of NIV, and only 1 was fully experienced. The mean amount of formal
training given over the first 3 months after a ward was opened by the research doctor
and nurse was 7.6 hours (SD 3.6)
Methods of analysis: Aimed to recruit 236 patients, which gave the study 80% power
for detecting a clinically significant difference in the proportion of patients experiencing
treatment failure at the 5% level of significance, on the assumption that 30% of the
standard group would fulfil the criteria for intubation, and that a 15% reduction in
the NIV group would be clinically relevant. Results given as means (SD) for normally
distributed data and as medians with 5th and 95th centiles for non-normally distributed
variables. All tests and P values are 2-tailed and were analysed on an intention-to-treat
basis. Group means were compared by t-test, and medians by Mann-Whitney U test.
Bonferroni’s correction to multiple comparisons. 2 × 2 tables were analysed by Fisher’s
exact test. Kaplan-Meier curves for time data and log-rank test for comparison. Analyses
were done by SPSS version 7
Aim: To evaluate whether NIV was feasible on the ward in non-specialist units, and
whether it was effective in reducing the need for intubation and in-hospital mortality,
compared with standard treatment, in patients admitted with mild to moderate acidosis
due to an exacerbation of COPD
Participants
Eligible for study: Patients eligible if admitted as an emergency with AECOPD (on the
basis of clinical history, physical examination, and CXR), with tachypnoea with RR ≥
23/min and pH 7.25 to 7.35 with PaCO2 > 6kPa on arrival to the general respiratory
ward within maximum of 12 hours from admission
Recruited: 236 randomised: 118 in intervention group and 118 in control group
Completed: Intervention group: 12 died and 106 survived. Control group: 24 died and
94 survived
Age: Intervention group: 69 ± 7 years. Control group: 69 ± 8 years
Gender: Intervention group: 54 males, 64 females. Control group: 63 males, 55 females.
More males in control group
Criteria used to define COPD: Based on clinical history, physical examination, and CXR
Exclusion criteria: pH < 7.25, GCS < 8, or active treatment deemed inappropriate
Interventions
Intervention description: NIV was initiated by the nurse at 13 centres and by the physio-
therapist at 1, with a standardised protocol. All centres used the same bi-level assist-mode
ventilator (VPAP-II, ResMed, UK) and were supplied with identical sets of masks. Two
face masks (Aircraft mask (Friday Medical, UK) and a small full-face mask (Respironics,
Inc., Murraysville, PA, USA) plus 2 nasal masks (small and medium Bubblie Cushion
Series 3 (ResMed, UK) were supplied with accompanying headgear. EPAP was set at
4 cmH2O. IPAP was initially set at 10 cmH2O, then was increased in increments of
5 cmH2O to 20 cmH2O or the maximum tolerated over 1 hour. All participants also
received usual care, which included oxygen to maintain a target oxygen saturation of
85% to 90% via pulse oximetry. The standard drug protocol consisted of nebulised
salbutamol (5 mg every 4 hours) or terbutaline, nebulised ipratropium bromide (500
mcg every 6 hours), corticosteroids (prednisolone 30 mg every day for minimum of 5

days), and an antibiotic. Aminophylline and doxapram could be used at the discretion
of the attending medical staff
Control description: Received controlled oxygen with fixed percentage masks (or nasal
cannulae if masks not tolerated) to maintain a target oxygen saturation of 85% to 90%
via pulse oximetry
Standard drug protocol consisted of nebulised salbutamol (5 mg every 4 hours) or terbu-
taline, nebulised ipratropium bromide (500 mcg every 6 hours), corticosteroids (pred-
nisolone 30 mg every day for minimum of 5 days), and an antibiotic. Aminophylline
and doxapram could be used at the discretion of the attending medical staff
Duration of intervention: Encouraged to use NIV as much as possible on day 1, for 16
hours on day 2, and for 12 hours on day 3. Routinely discontinued on day 4, although
an option to continue was available if clinically indicated
Intervention delivery by: NIV was initiated by the nurse at 13 centres and by the phys-
iotherapist at 1, with a standardised protocol
Outcomes
Method of outcome data collection: Data were collected in the general ward setting at
baseline and throughout hospital stay
Prespecified primary outcome: Protocol not available. In text outcome: Need for intu-
bation, if participants met any criteria within 14 days of admission. After criteria were
met, attending physicians were able to offer any of the following: continued standard
treatment, NIV off protocol by a more sophisticated NIV, or intubation and mechanical
ventilation
Prespecified secondary outcome: Protocol not available. In text outcomes: Mortality;
respiratory rate; ABG at enrolment, 1 hour and 4 hours after randomisation, and on
day 3; hospital length of stay. Mask comfort and breathlessness were assessed by 5-
point verbal rating. Mobility and nutritional status assessed by nursing staff and nursing
workload. ABG at room air and spirometry measured when possible at discharge or
within 3 months
Validation: Respiratory rate and ABG at enrolment, 1 hour and 4 hours after randomi-
sation, and on day 3. Mask comfort and breathlessness were assessed by 5-point ver-
bal rating scales - comfortable/mildly uncomfortable/moderately uncomfortable/very
uncomfortable/intolerable; not breathless/mildly breathless/moderately breathless/very
breathless/most breathless I have ever been. ABG at room air and spirometry measured
when possible at discharge or within 3 months
Follow-up period: Throughout admission, until discharge
Number of follow-up periods reported on during study: 4 (at enrolment, 1 hour and 4
hours after randomisation, and on day 3)
Indications for intubation: pH < 7.20; pH 7.2 to 7.25 on 2 occasions 1 hour apart;
hypercapnic coma (GCS < 8 and PaCO2 > 8 kPa); PaO2 < 6 kPa despite maximum
tolerated FiO2; cardiorespiratory arrest
Notes
The number of participants intolerant of NIV was not stated; however, 7.2% of partic-
ipants used NIV < 1 hour on first day, rising to 23.6% on day 2, and 32.3% on day 3.
Those assigned to NIV used it for a median duration of 3 days (range 0 to 26). Median
NIV use was 8 hours on day 1, 7 hours on day 2, and 5 hours on day 3. Median comfort
score on first 3 days for NIV group was 2 - mildly uncomfortable

Methods
Country: Belgium
Design: Single-centre randomised controlled parallel-group trial conducted between
1999 and 2000
Study site: One urban university teaching hospital in Brussels, Belgium
Method of analysis: t-tests, ANOVA
Aim: To determine whether (1) benefits of NIV on need for intubation, length of stay,
and mortality are noted when NIV is performed in an emergency department (ED)
very early after admission; and (2) early NIV has a real, rather than placebo, effect on
objectively measured parameters and clinical status
Participants
Eligible for study: 187 (of either COPD or APO diagnosis) patients admitted to emer-
gency department with acute respiratory failure
Recruited: 20adultpatients(10inNIV group; 10incontrol group)with acute respiratory
failure secondary to AECOPD (n = 12) or APO (n = 8). Of those with AECOPD, 7
were in NIV group; 5 in control group
Completed: 20 participants (10 in each group)

NIV group: mean (SD) age = 71 (9) years; usual care group: mean (SD) age = 76 (7)
years
Gender: Unable to ascertain for COPD-only participants. Total (combined diagnoses)
gender (M:F) = 7:3 (NIV group); 4:6 (control group)
Criteria used to define COPD: AECOPD defined as acute respiratory distress in a
cigarette smoker with known history of long-lasting dyspnoea on exertion with frequent
exacerbations and cough, and mucus hyperproduction, without symptoms or signs of
other specific causes (absence of pneumothorax, pneumonia, pleural effusion, no reason
to suspect an episode of pulmonary embolism)
Inclusion criteria:
Aged 18 years or older with evidence of ARF (3 of the following criteria: acute onset of
moderate to severe dyspnoea; respiratory rate > 30 (or < 10) breaths/min; hypoxaemia
(PaO2 < 7.3 kPa (55 mmHg) on room air) or need for oxygen supplementation; respi-
ratory acidosis (pH < 7.33)
Exclusion criteria: immediate indication for endotracheal intubation (respiratory and/or
cardiac arrest); major unrest; haemodynamic instability despite a fluid challenge; facial or
thoracic trauma; lack of co-operation; difficult adaptation of a facial mask to a patient’s
facial anatomy; clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism; retrosternal pain suggestive
of a myocardial ischaemia even with normal admission electrocardiogram (ECG)
Interventions
Intervention description: Usual care (no sham NIV) plus bi-level NIV (BiPAP ST/D 30;
Respironics, Inc., Murrysville, PA, USA). BiPAP was used with inspiratory PS initially
set at 10 cmH2O and EPAP at 4 cmH2O, used in assist-control mode with a backup
frequency of 10 breaths/min, via face mask (Bird, Bird Corp., Riverside, CA, USA).
IPAP was increased by 2 cmH2O steps, until signs of discomfort (increasing sensation
of dyspnoea), observation of air leaks, or pressure of 20 cmH2O was reached. EPAP was
similarly increased until discomfort
Supplemental oxygen included via nasal catheter as required to maintain oxygen satura-
tion > 90%
Control description: Supplemental oxygen, bronchodilator aerosol therapy (fenoterol
1500 mg and ipratropium bromide 0.4 mg) repeated every 20 minutes and IV gluco-
corticoids (methylprednisolone 80 mg). Sham NIV employed, involving same setup as
NIV group but a modified T-connector piece (several holes created) between mask and
tubing to enable IPAP = EPAP = 0 cmH2O. Oxygen was added with a nasal catheter
inside the mask as needed to obtain saturation of 90%
Treatment failure and success were defined in advance. Treatment success led to study
end, treatment failure led to intubation in the active NIV group. Failure in the placebo
NIV group led first to active NIV (rescue protocol)
Duration of intervention: Until treatment success or failure
Intervention delivery by: An attending physician delivered initial care and referred eli-
gible patients. NIV or sham NIV was delivered by 2 study investigators. The attending
physician remained present for the duration of the study (to decide treatment success or
failure at any time point)
Setting: Emergency department
Outcomes
Prespecified primary outcomes: Treatment failure (defined by all as worsened dyspnoea,
respiratory and/or heart frequency, sweating and agitation, or deterioration in blood gases
and/or haemodynamic status). For NIV group, this represented intubation; for control
group, this represented cross-over to NIV intervention (before potential subsequent

Updates undertaken since publication of the original review resulted in the following changes to the protocol.
1. Significant updates to the methods to bring the review in line with current Cochrane (MECIR) standards. This included
insertion of a ’Summary of findings’ table and updates to the risk of bias methods (removal of the Jadad scale). This process included
evaluation of the following additional domains of potential bias: imbalance of outcome measures at baseline, comparability of
intervention and control group characteristics at baseline, protection against contamination, and selective recruitment of participants.
2. Following critical feedback regarding this review, we amended the definition of AHRF from the initial review to now include
reference to pH < 7.35. We deemed this essential to enhance its consistency with clinical practice.
3. Amendment of primary review outcomes. In the initial version, the primary outcome was ’treatment failure’, defined according
to any combination of intubation, mortality, or treatment failure. To remove ambiguity regarding overlap between these definitions,
the current version lists treatment intolerance as an independent secondary review outcome. We also made clarifications to the
definition of our primary outcome ’need for endotracheal intubation’ to minimise ambiguity.
4. Exclusion of one study that was included in the original review (Conti 2002) due to inclusion of mechanical ventilation as a
comparator intervention; and reclassification of one study originally included in the review (Servillo 1994) to ’Awaiting classification’
due to lack of sufficient information pertaining to mean baseline pH to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review in accordance
with our revised definition of AHRF.
5. Replacement of one abstract included in the original review with a full-text version in the update (Khilnani 2002 is now
Khilnani 2010).

 6. Minor edits to wording of two eligibility criteria to explicitly clarify that (a) studies of patients who commenced NIV before
hospital admission are ineligible for inclusion in the review; and (b) ’usual medical care’ may not include any form of positive pressure
ventilation considered to be ’usual’ for that study centre.
7. Thys 2002 was originally included as an ’ICU’ study in the subgroup analysis of ward versus ICU care. As this study was based
in an emergency department (potentially more intensive than a ward, but not an ICU setting), in keeping with the primary aim of the
review, we excluded this study from the ward versus ICU subgroup analysis for the present (and subsequent) updates.
8. Data from Bott 1993 were originally included in some of the meta-analyses related to blood gas tensions; however owing to lack
of sufficient study information regarding the number of participants included in these outcome data, this study was subsequently
removed from the meta-analysis and was reported separately. Additionally, mortality data were removed from the meta-analysis, as
they were identified as relevant to the post-discharge period, not to in-hospital mortality.
9. We conducted subgroup analyses of admission pH and location only for the primary outcomes of interest for this review
(mortality and need for endotracheal intubation), rather than for all outcomes.
10. One additional table (percentage change in PaCO2 at one hour post intervention) included in the earlier review was removed.
11. Type of NIV for subgroup analysis was removed from the investigation of heterogeneity section of the protocol, as all studies
except one used pressure-cycled NIV.
