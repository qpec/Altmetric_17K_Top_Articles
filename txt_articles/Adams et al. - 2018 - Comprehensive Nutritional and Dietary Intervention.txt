Abstract: This study involved a randomized, controlled, single-blind 12-month treatment study
of a comprehensive nutritional and dietary intervention. Participants were 67 children and adults
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) ages 3–58 years from Arizona and 50 non-sibling neurotypical
controls of similar age and gender. Treatment began with a special vitamin/mineral supplement,
and additional treatments were added sequentially, including essential fatty acids, Epsom salt baths,
carnitine, digestive enzymes, and a healthy gluten-free, casein-free, soy-free (HGCSF) diet. There was
a significant improvement in nonverbal intellectual ability in the treatment group compared to the
non-treatment group (+6.7 ± 11 IQ points vs. −0.6 ± 11 IQ points, p = 0.009) based on a blinded
clinical assessment. Based on semi-blinded assessment, the treatment group, compared to the
non-treatment group, had significantly greater improvement in autism symptoms and developmental
age. The treatment group had significantly greater increases in EPA, DHA, carnitine, and vitamins
A, B2, B5, B6, B12, folic acid, and Coenzyme Q10. The positive results of this study suggest
that a comprehensive nutritional and dietary intervention is effective at improving nutritional
status, non-verbal IQ, autism symptoms, and other symptoms in most individuals with ASD.
Parents reported that the vitamin/mineral supplements, essential fatty acids, and HGCSF diet
were the most beneficial.

1. Introduction
Many studies have demonstrated that children and adults with ASD often have significant
nutritional deficiencies, metabolic imbalances, and digestive problems. Several nutritional and dietary

2 of 43
treatment studies have demonstrated benefits in treating these underlying conditions [1–3]. In the
following sections we discuss specific research related to vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids,
mitochondrial disorders/carnitine issues, and gastrointestinal disorders (digestive problems and food
sensitivities).
1.1. Vitamins/Minerals
Several studies suggest that customized vitamin/mineral supplementation is beneficial for
children with ASD. Three studies have demonstrated that children with ASD have impaired
methylation, decreased glutathione, and increased oxidative stress [4–6]. Those studies demonstrated
that nutritional supplementation (with methyl-B12, folinic acid, and trimethylglycine) is beneficial.
Several other studies have also demonstrated increased oxidative stress [7–12].
Methylation is
important because that controls epigenetics, and there is evidence that there are many differentially
methylated regions in the brains of children with ASD vs. controls [13].
In 2008/2009 we conducted an extensive comparison of the nutritional and metabolic status of
children with ASD (n = 55) compared to neurotypical children of similar age and gender (n = 44) [14].
Study measurements included vitamins, biomarkers of vitamin status, minerals, plasma amino acids,
plasma glutathione, neurotransmitters, and biomarkers of oxidative stress, methylation, sulfation and
energy production. Many statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) were observed in the ASD
group compared to the neurotypical group, including: low levels of biotin, glutathione, methylation
status (S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and uridine), ATP, NADH, NADPH, sulfate (free and total),
tryptophan, and GABA; also, high levels of oxidative stress markers and plasma glutamate.
That study was followed by a three-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
treatment study involving a customized vitamin/mineral supplement [15]. The supplement was found
to be well-absorbed and result in many significant improvements in metabolic status, including SAM,
reduced glutathione, ratio of oxidized glutathione to reduced glutathione (GSSG:GSH), nitrotyrosine,
ATP, NADH, and NADPH. Most of these metabolic biomarkers improved to normal or near-normal
levels. However, although free and total plasma sulfate levels improved, they remained below
normal, suggesting that additional treatments are needed to fully normalize sulfation. That study also
found that the supplement group had significantly greater improvements than the placebo group on
autism-related symptoms on the Parental Global Impressions-Revised Average Change (p = 0.008),
and on the subscores for Hyperactivity (p = 0.003), Tantrumming (p = 0.009), Overall (p = 0.02),
and Receptive Language (p = 0.03).
1.2. Essential Fatty Acids
Several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are either essential or conditionally essential, including
several omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Meta-analyses of many studies have demonstrated that
omega-3 levels are decreased in certain psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (meta-analysis of
14 studies) [16], ADHD (9 studies) [17]), depression (14 studies) [18], bipolar disorder (six studies) [19],
and dementia (10 studies) [20].
Meta-analyses of many clinical trials have demonstrated benefits of supplementation with omega-3
PUFA’s for schizophrenia (10 trials) [21], ADHD (16 trials) [17], major depression (12 trials) [22],
bipolar depression (5 trials) [23], and possibly dementia (eight of 13 trials positive) [24]. Meta-analyses
findings indicated that EPA was more beneficial than DHA, and that higher levels of EPA were more
beneficial. There is also one study [25] that found omega-3 fatty acid supplementation is very helpful for
infants with Rett’s syndrome, a disorder which often includes autistic symptoms.
PUFA’s may also play a role in some gastrointestinal problems, since they are important for
intestinal membrane function. One epidemiological study found that increasing incidence of Crohn’s
disease correlated very strongly (r = 0.79) with low levels of omega-3 fatty acids [26]. A one-year,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fish oil (2.7 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids) in people with
Crohn’s disease found that subjects taking the fish oil had a significantly reduced relapse rate, with no
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
3 of 43
significant adverse effects [27]. Gastrointestinal problems are common in ASD [14,28], and PUFA
supplementation may be beneficial for reducing some gastrointestinal problems in children with ASD.
A meta-analysis [29] of fifteen case-control studies (n = 1193) found that, compared with typically
developed individuals, the ASD group had lower eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA), and a lower ratio of total omega-3 to total omega-6 fatty acids;
these differences were primarily found in studies with children, and not in studies with adolescents or
adults. A meta-analysis [29] of four small randomized controlled trials (n = 107) [30–33] found that
compared with placebo, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation improved social withdrawal (p < 0.02)
and restricted interests and behaviors (p = 0.05), but did not have a significant effect on communication,
irritability, or hyperactivity (all rated per the Aberrant Behavior Checklist). These studies only lasted
6–16 weeks, so were too short to observe full effect, since omega-3 supplementation requires about six
months to reach steady-state levels in erythrocytes, and about 1–1.5 months for half of that change
to occur [34]. These studies used doses of 0.5–1.5 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids. Two other small
randomized studies [35,36] not included in the meta-analysis [29] did not find significant effects on
symptoms despite longer duration (6 months), possibly due to small sizes (under 35 participants
completed each study) or low dose (200 mg DHA) in one study [36].
Overall, it appears that omega-3 fatty acids are decreased in ASD, and that supplementation may
be helpful. Higher doses and longer treatment may result in greater benefit. For example, a treatment
study for Crohn’s disease found that long-term treatment (12 months) may be needed for improvement
in gastrointestinal problems. We hypothesize that children with ASD who do not regularly eat seafood
(the major source of omega-3 fatty acids in most western diets) are more likely to benefit from fish
oil supplementation.
1.3. Sulfate
Sulfur is the fourth most common mineral in the body [37]. Most sulfate is produced in vivo
by metabolism of cysteine [14]. Sulfation is important for many reactions including detoxification,
inactivation of catecholamines, synthesis of brain tissue, sulfation of mucin proteins which line
the gastrointestinal tract, and more. Low free and total plasma sulfate in children with ASD has
been previously reported in three studies [14,38,39], and is consistent with four studies [38,40–42]
which found that children with ASD, compared to controls, had a significantly decreased sulfation
capacity, based on decreased ability to detoxify paracetamol (acetaminophen). The finding of low
plasma sulfate is also consistent with a large study that found high sulfate in the urine of children
with ASD [43], as sulfate wasting in the urine partly explains low levels in the plasma. ATP is
required for the kidneys to resorb sulfate, and one study [14] found that plasma ATP was low in
children with ASD and moderately correlated with levels of free and total plasma sulfate (r = 0.32
and 0.44, respectively), suggesting, that low levels of ATP are a contributor to decreased sulfate in
children with ASD. One study [43], also reported high levels of urinary sulfite in children with ASD,
suggesting that there was a problem of converting sulfite to sulfate in the mitochondria. In 38% of cases
(14/38) urinary sulfite and sulfate levels improved by giving 50 mcg of molybdenum, based upon
molybdenum dependence of the enzyme necessary for converting sulfite to sulfate (sulfite oxidase).
Another study [15] found that a vitamin/mineral supplement (containing molybdenum) was able to
improve, but not normalize, free and total plasma sulfate in children with ASD. Overall, these studies
suggest that sulfate is low in children with ASD, and that vitamin/mineral supplementation is helpful
but additional sources of sulfate (such as Epsom salt baths) are needed.
1.4. Carnitine and Mitochondrial Disorders
Carnitine is a conditionally essential nutrient that is vital in energy production and fatty acid
metabolism. Carnitine carries long-chain fatty acids (fuel) into the mitochondria, and it also carries
potentially toxic organic acids out of the mitochondria and cell so they can be eliminated from
the body. Several studies have suggested that mitochondrial disorders are common in children
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
4 of 43
with ASD [44–48]. Note that the term “mitochondrial disorders” is used to denote a generalized
impairment of mitochondrial function, and are generally not as severe as “mitochondrial diseases”,
which involve specific severe genetic abnormalities. One study found decreased levels of carnitine in
children with ASD [49]. A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month study (n = 30) found that
supplementation with carnitine was beneficial [50]. Specifically, the study found significantly greater
improvements in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale 2 (CARS-2) and Clinical Global Impressions
(CGI) scores in the treatment group compared to the placebo group. In addition, scores significantly
improved in cognition and marginally in speech on the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC).
L-carnitine therapy significantly increased serum carnitine concentrations, and significant correlations
between changes in serum free-carnitine levels and positive clinical changes were observed. L-carnitine
therapy was generally well-tolerated by study subjects. A second study [51] found similar results.
Overall, the literature suggests that mitochondrial disorders are common in ASD, and that a
combination of therapy with vitamins, minerals, CoEnzyme Q10, essential fatty acids, and L-carnitine
may be helpful in improving mitochondrial function.
1.5. Gastrointestinal Problems, Digestive Enzymes, Limited Diets, and Food Sensitivities
Gastrointestinal problems are common in children with ASD, especially chronic constipation,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal inflammation [28,52]. A study by our group [53] found
that those problems are strongly correlated to autism severity (r = 0.59, p < 0.001), suggesting that it
is important to investigate them. As reported, in those with ASD, gastrointestinal problems appear
to be partly due to deficiencies in digestive enzymes, partly due to food sensitivities, and possibly
(as discussed above) due to low levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which in turn, could result in abnormal
gut bacteria [54]. One large study by Horvath et al. evaluated disaccharidase activity from endoscopic
biopsies in 90 children with ASD. They found that 49% had at least one deficient enzyme activity,
and 20% had deficiencies in two or more disaccharidase enzymes “Lactase and maltase deficiencies were
the most frequent, followed by low activity of sucrase, palatinase, and glucoamylase. All of the children
with low enzyme activity had loose stools and/or gaseousness”. Another large study [55] involving
intestinal biopsy samples of 199 children and adults with ASD (ages 22 months to 28 years) found that
many had deficiencies in disaccharidases (enzymes for digesting simple sugars). Specifically, they found
that 62% had deficiencies in lactase, 16% were deficient in sucrase, and 10% were deficient in maltase.
The problems seemed to be equally common in children and adults, suggesting that these problems
are lifelong. An open-label treatment study of 46 children and adults with ASD reported a wide
range of benefits from the use of digestive enzymes [56], but results of randomized controlled trials
are mixed [57,58]. Some studies have suggested that children with ASD have poor diets, leading to
decreased intake of key nutrients [59,60].
Several studies have found that children with ASD have abnormal immune responses to certain
foods, especially glutens (in wheat, rye, barley, oats) and casein (in dairy products) and sometimes
soy. One study [61] found that many children with ASD have food sensitivities. Four studies [62–65]
found that children with ASD had more hypersensitivities to food allergens than did typical children,
and may be related to increased intestinal permeability [65,66]. A large study of 150 children with
ASD found that 87% had IgG antibodies (sensitivity) to gluten, vs. 1% of the age and gender-matched
controls, and 90% had IgG antibodies to casein, vs. 7% of the controls [67].
Several studies suggest that special diets can be beneficial for individuals with ASD. One open-label
study [68] found that an 8-week diet which avoided allergic foods resulted in benefits in an open study
of 36 children with ASD. One long-term open-label study of 70 children with ASD who followed a
gluten-free, casein-free diet for one year or longer found that 81% improved significantly by the third
month, with improvements continuing over the next 12 months. Large improvements were observed
in social isolation, eye contact, mutism, learning skills, hyperactivity, stereotypic activity, and panic
attacks [67]. A single-blind study of 10 children with autism found that 8 benefitted from a gluten-free,
casein-free (GFCF) diet [69]. A 12-week, double-blind, cross-over study of a GFCF diet in 15 children
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
5 of 43
with ASD did not find significant benefits, but parents reported benefits that were not identified by
the testing [70]. However, a 12-month, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled GFCF diet study
involving 54 children with ASD found statistically significant benefits in communication subscores
(Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) evaluation) in the GFCF diet group compared to
the control group [71]. The parents (who were not blinded) also reported benefits in social interaction,
daily living skills, inattention, and hyperactivity.
Overall, these studies suggest that children with ASD often have deficiencies in lactase and other
digestive enzymes, may have poor diets, often have food sensitivities, especially to gluten and casein, and
hence may benefit from digestive enzymes, healthier diets, and/or gluten-free, casein-free diets [65,66].
1.6. Study Goal
The goal of this study is to investigate a comprehensive nutritional and dietary intervention to
treat children and adults with ASD. Each of these treatments have been previously studied individually
and found to have some benefit, mostly in short-term studies. The goal of this study is to investigate the
effect of the combination of those treatments in a long-term study. Combinations of these treatments are
commonly used for treating children and adults with ASD, their effects are expected to be synergistic,
and longer-term treatment may lead to greater benefits. An unusually wide age range was used in this
study because this study was funded primarily by families participating in our annual walk fundraiser,
and they have requested treatment studies that address all ages. This study is not designed to look
at the effect of individual treatments (most of them have already been investigated individually);
rather the goal is to investigate the effect of a combination of treatments which provide comprehensive,
synergistic nutritional support.
1.7. Hypothesis
A combination of nutritional and dietary interventions will be effective in reducing the symptoms
of autism, reducing gastrointestinal problems, and increasing overall functioning level.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Design and Justification
This was a one-year, single-blinded study, involving a treatment group and a non-treated group
of children and adults with ASD. Single-blind means that the clinical evaluators were blinded, but
the participants were not. The reason for this design is that we wanted to conduct a long-term
study on the effects of a comprehensive set of dietary and nutritional treatments, similar to what
the Autism Research Institute has recommended for years [72]. We believe that length of time is
too long for a double-blind, placebo-controlled format, because too many participants would drop
out. Also, it is extremely difficult to do a double-blind study when making major diet changes,
especially the switch to a “healthy” diet as described below. A single-blind study is still a rigorous
study design for assessments for which the clinical observer is fully blinded, and the additional data
from unblinded participants provides some useful information similar to an open-label study. Since
this was an exploratory new treatment, the choice of sample size was roughly estimated based on
previous studies. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are
registered (Clinicialtrials.gov: NCT02059577).
2.2. Participant Enrollment
The study was advertised by email to approximately 2500 ASD families in Arizona, using the
contact list of the Autism Society of Greater Phoenix and the Autism/Asperger’s Research Program at
Arizona State University (ASU). Interested ASD families attended a one-hour informational meeting,
and consenting families joined the study. Neurotypical families were recruited from friends of the
ASD families and professionals who work with ASD families. Participants were recruited for the study
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
6 of 43
from October 2011 to April 2014. All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they
participated in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,
and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Arizona State University.
2.3. Enrollment Criteria—ASD Group
1.
Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (autism, Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise
Specified (PDD-NOS), or Asperger’s) by a psychiatrist, psychologist, or developmental pediatrician.
2.
Verification of diagnosis by ASU staff based on the ADOS and/or CARS-2.
3.
Age of 2.5–60 years.
4.
No major changes in behavioral or medical treatments in the previous two months, and no
intention to make such changes during the 12 months of the study.
5.
No usage of nutritional supplements (vitamins, minerals essential fatty acids, carnitine) or special
diets in the previous two months.
2.4. Enrollment Criteria—Neurotypical Group
1.
No diagnosed mental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety, etc.
2.
No first-degree relatives of individuals with ASD (no siblings or parents).
3.
Age of 2.5–60 years.
4.
No usage of nutritional supplements (vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, carnitine) or special
diets in the previous two months.
Note that there was no exclusion for individuals with ASD with specific metabolic or genetic
disorders. No participants reported unusual genetic or metabolic disorders, but there was no attempt
to screen for those, and it is likely that some may have existed.
2.5. Participants
The characteristics of the study participants are listed in Table 1. The ASD treatment group,
ASD non-treatment group, and the neurotypical controls have similar age distributions (mostly children,
some teens, and a few adults), and similar gender distributions (mostly male). The ASD treatment and
non-treatment group have similar diagnoses (mostly autism). For the ASD group, 100% met the criteria
for ASD per the CARS-2, and 88% met the criteria for ASD per the ADOS (most of the 8 participants
who met only the CARS-2 criteria were high-functioning teens/adults who in the clinical judgement of
the evaluator were clearly on the ASD spectrum, so they were admitted to the study).

2.6. Randomization
After enrollment and ADOS/CARS-2/Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales (RIAS)/Severity
of Autism Scale (SAS-Pro) assessment, participants were randomly assigned to either the Treatment
or Non-treatment group. The study coordinator enrolled participants, conducted the randomization,
and assigned participants to interventions.
She was not involved in any of the evaluations.
The Treatment group began treatment immediately, whereas the Non-treatment group was asked
not to make any changes in medical, nutritional, therapy, or education treatment for 12 months.
The Non-treatment group was promised that they would receive all the supplements and diet advice
at the end of the study if they made no major changes to any educational interventions for 12 months,
which helped minimize the drop-out rate. Participants were enrolled on a rolling basis, and participants
with similar ages were matched and then randomly assigned to one of the two groups.
2.7. Protocols
2.7.1. Protocol for ASD Treatment Group
Initial evaluation of autism severity and overall functioning level.
Physical examination by the study physician to verify that the participant is in sufficient good
health to participate in the study. Initial blood draw and first-morning urine collection.
Day 0: Vitamin/Mineral supplementation begins.
Day 30: Essential Fatty Acid supplementation begins.
Day 60: Epsom salt baths begin.
Day 90: Carnitine Supplementation begins.
Day 180: Digestive Enzyme supplementation begins.
Day 210: Healthy, casein-free, gluten-free diet begins.
Day 365: Final assessment of autism severity and overall functioning status. Final blood draw
and urine collection.
2.7.2. Protocol for ASD Non-Treatment Group
Initial evaluation of autism severity and overall functioning level.
Physical examination by study physician to verify that participant is in sufficient good health to
participate in the study. Initial blood draw and first-morning urine collection.
Day 365: Verification of no changes in treatment during last 12 months. Final assessment of
autism severity and overall functioning status. Final blood draw and urine collection.
2.7.3. Protocol for Neurotypical Group
Physical examination by study physician to verify that participant is in sufficient good health to
participate in the study. Initial blood draw and first-morning urine collection.
2.8. Biomarker Measurements
Biomarkers in blood and urine were measured at the beginning and end of the study in the
children and adults in the ASD groups, and one time at the start of the study in the neurotypical group.
The samples were sent in a blinded fashion to the laboratories for testing.
Some testing was done by LabCorp, and some by Doctor’s Data. Both commercial laboratories
are approved by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) program operated by the
US Department of Health and Human Services which oversees approximately 200,000 laboratories in
the US. Samples were taken by courier from our medical office to the local LabCorp testing facility in
Phoenix (refrigerated or on dry ice as appropriate). Samples for Doctor’s Data were shipped overnight,
either with cold packs or on dry ice as appropriate.
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369

LabCorp conducted standard measurements of blood chemistry, Complete Blood Count (CBC)
with differential, ammonia, lactic acid, creatine kinase, and a thyroid panel (TSH, T3, T4).
Doctor’s Data conducted measurements of Red Blood Cell (RBC) elements and urinary iodine
using the same methods as reported in a previous study [14]. Doctor’s Data also measured RBC fatty
acids, C-Reactive Protein, and homocysteine-related metabolites (homocysteine, cysteine, methionine).
RBC fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector. Red Blood
Cells were washed and derivatized to their methyl esters and extracted and separated according to
carbon number.
•
High sensitivity C-Reactive Protein was measured using an immunoturbidimetric method using
Kamiya Reagents and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer (Brea, CA, USA)
•
Homocysteine was measured by LC/MS after reduction using dithiothreitol and derivatization.
Vitamins and carnitine were measured at UC-San Diego by some of our team using liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (SCIEX, Redwood City, CA, USA) as previously
described with modifications [73] (PMID 25705365). The absolute concentrations of acylcarnitines were
calculated using stable isotope internal standards. The levels of vitamin and co-factors were normalized
using neurotypical control baseline values and reported as peak area ratios.
2.9. Handgrip Strength
Handgrip strength, an indicator of muscle strength, was assessed by using a pneumatic, adjustable
squeeze pinch-gauge/dynamometer (Baseline Evaluation Instruments; White Plains, NY, USA) by
a study nurse unaware of the treatment status of the subject. This instrument is a reliable and valid
method for obtaining muscle force measurements in children and adults, and takes only a few min.
One of three bulb sizes was used, depending on the participant’s hand size, and the same size was
used at beginning and end of the study. Each participant was shown how to squeeze the bulb with one
hand, and then three measurements were taken, and the highest value was recorded.
2.10. Autism Severity and Overall Functioning Assessments
A large number of assessments of autism severity and overall functioning were used because
we hypothesized that there might be improvements in many different areas. Most assessments were
conducted for the autism treatment and non-treatment groups at the beginning and end of the study.
The PGI-2 was assessed at month, 3, 6, 9, and 12 for the treatment group, and at month 12 for the
non-treatment group. The initial assessments were conducted before randomization, so neither the
participants nor the evaluator knew which group they were in. At the end of the study, the evaluator
first conducted the ADOS and RIAS assessments in a blinded manner. The evaluator then conducted
the CARS-2 and SAS-Pro assessments, which did involve some discussion with the parents (except for
a few high-functioning participants who did not have a parent available). The Vineland was conducted
by phone by a different blinded evaluator. The blinding of the evaluators at the beginning and end of
the study was complete in all cases except for one CARS-2/SAS-Pro assessment at the end of the study
(a participant inadvertently commented about the treatment).
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS): The ADOS is a 1-h structured interaction
and is one of the primary tools used for clinical diagnosis of autism and autism spectrum disorders.
It involved a blinded evaluation by clinicians certified in ADOS assessment.
Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales (RIAS): The RIAS assesses verbal and non-verbal IQ and
memory. It involves a 20–30 min blinded assessment by clinicians using a variety of standardized IQ
and memory activities.
Childhood Autism Rating Scale 2 (CARS-2): The CARS-2 evaluation was conducted after the
ADOS and RIAS evaluations, and was based partly on the participant’s performance and interactions
on those assessments, and partly on specific interactions and interview questions with the participant
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
9 of 43
and their parents. The clinician was blinded as to the participant’s treatment status, but the participants
and the parents were not, so this is classified as “semi-blinded”.
Severity of Autism Scale (SAS-Pro): The SAS-Pro is a single number on a scale of 0–10 to evaluate
overall severity of autism symptoms. It was evaluated by the professional evaluator after the ADOS,
RIAS, and CARS-2, so it was classified as “semi-blinded”.
All of the ADOS, RIAS, CARS-2, and SAS-Pro evaluations were done by the same professional
evaluator at beginning and end (either EP or JI).
Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II (VABS-II): The VABS-II was conducted by a phone interview
with the participant’s parents (or the participants in a few cases for high-functioning adults), so it
was classified as “semi-blinded”. One evaluator (RLA) conducted all the interviews at beginning
and end. The calculated raw scores were then converted into an age equivalent. However, most of
the questions are geared towards younger ages, and there are fewer questions for the older ages,
and a difference of one point for the older participants can result in a jump of more than 1 year of
developmental age. Therefore, for scoring purposes we set a maximum age for the following subscales,
based on the age at which questions became sparse: Receptive—11 years; Communication—12.3 years;
Written—15.3 years; Domestic—15.3 years; Play—19 years; Coping—17.8 years; Gross Motor—6.8 years;
Fine Motor—6.8 years; the other subscales (Personal and Community) had a maximum of 22 years.
Only 2 participants in the treatment group and 2 participants in the non-treatment group had some
scores at the maximum of any subscale, except for the Gross Motor and Fine Motor subscales, which
had 32% and 44% of the treatment and non-treatment group scoring at the maximum for those
subscales. So, although scores for Gross Motor and Fine Motor skills are reported, they need to
be interpreted cautiously.
Parents (or the participants in a few cases for high-functioning adults) completed an initial medical
history form, and at the beginning and end of the study they also completed several questionnaires
to assess autism and related symptoms, including the following: ATEC, Pervasive Developmental
Disorders Behavior Inventory (PDD-BI), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), 6-item Gastrointestinal
Severity Index (6-GSI), Short Sensory Profile (SSP), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), and Medical
History. Also, the Parent Global Impressions-2 (PGI-2) was completed at the end of months 3, 6, 9, and
12, to assess changes during the previous 3 months.
The PGI-2 is introduced here as an expanded version of the PGI-R [14]. The PGI-2 evaluates
changes in 17 areas, and overall, using a 7-point scale ranging from “much worse” to “much better”.
An “Average Change” is computed by computing the average in all 18 scores of the PGI-2, but exempting
areas where initial symptom severity was “none”. The PGI-2 is similar to the CGI, but conducted by a
parent instead of a clinician, and specific to autism. As discussed in a previous paper [15] our experience
indicates it is more reliable to ask parents directly about observed changes than to have them estimate
symptom severity at beginning and end and then compute a difference. Also, the use of a 7-point scale
to detect changes seems to yield a high sensitivity to changes. Note that for each symptom we only
report changes if the participant had the symptom at the start of the study.
2.11. Treatments
2.11.1. Vitamin/Mineral Supplement
This study involved an improved version of the vitamin/mineral supplement which was found
to be beneficial for children and adults with ASD in a previous study [15]. The supplement from that
study was slightly modified based on pre and post measurements of levels of vitamins, minerals, and
other biomarkers [15]. The major changes for this study included: increases of some nutrients (vitamin
D, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, selenium, mixed tocopherols) and decreases of others (manganese,
molybdenum, lithium). Also, several new nutrients were added, including Vitamin K, potassium,
carnitine, vanadium, and boron.

Table 2 lists the supplement used in this study, at a dosage for a 60-pound (27 kg) child. The dosage
was adjusted up or down based on bodyweight, to a maximum of 120 pounds (54 kg). The dosage was
slowly increased over 4 weeks to the level listed in Table 2. In most cases the dosage was split into
three doses (breakfast, lunch, dinner), but in a few cases the families preferred to split it into two doses
for convenience (breakfast and dinner).

2.11.2. Essential Fatty Acids
One of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids is fish oil, and a recent study [74] confirms the
high absorption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil. We used a concentrated fish oil supplement,
ProEFA-Xtra by Nordic Naturals, which is a blend of fish oil (for omega-3 fatty acids) and modest
amounts of borage oil (for omega-6 fatty acids). Each capsule contains: 609 mg omega-3 fatty acids
(425 mg EPA, 110 mg DHA, 74 mg other omega-3 fatty acids), 198 mg omega-6 fatty acids (including
128 mg GLA), and 15 mg omega-9 fatty acids. The dosage varied with body weight:
•
30–50 pounds (14–23 kg): 2 capsules/day
•
51–100 pounds (23–45 kg): 3 capsules/day
•
100+ pounds (45+ kg): 4 capsules/day
Initial dosages started at 1 capsule/day, and increased to the above dosage over 2–4 weeks.
2.11.3. Epsom Salt Baths
Epsom salts are magnesium sulfate, and internal research by one of our team (TA) has found
that Epsom salt baths are one of the most effective ways to raise plasma sulfate levels, which are
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
11 of 43
normally low in people with ASD. Therefore, each participant was asked to take a warm bath for 20 min
2×/week, with 2 cups Epsom salt and a half cup baking soda (which increases absorption of Epsom
salts) added to the bath.
2.11.4. Carnitine
Each participant was given a dosage of 50 mg acetyl-L-carnitine/kg bodyweight-day, to a maximum
of 2 grams/day, the same dosage as used in a previous study [50] involving L-carnitine, as that dosage
was found to be beneficial and well-tolerated. The dosage was gradually increased to the full dosage
over 4 weeks. Half the dosage was given in the morning, and half at dinnertime.
2.11.5. Digestive Enzymes
This study involved the use of a comprehensive digestive enzyme complex for digesting food
proteins (peptidase, protease 4.5, protease 3.0), carbohydrates (lactase, alpha-galactosidase, invertase,
xylanase), starches (amylase, glucoamylase) and fats (lipase)—see Table 3. The dosage was one capsule
for a snack or small adult meal, two capsules for a typical adult meal, and three capsules for a large
adult meal. Compared to other commercial digestive enzymes, this complex is characterized as
“low-medium” in protease activity, “medium” level in carbohydrase and starch-hydrolyzing activity,
and “medium-high” in lipase activity.

2.11.6. Healthy, Gluten-Free, Casein-Free, Soy-Free Diet
Participants were provided with written instructions about the diet, a 1-h PowerPoint presentation
with audio describing the diet, a 1-h personal consult with one of our nutritionists, and the opportunity
to ask additional questions from the nutritionist or study nurse. The nutritionist provided detailed
advice, but the family made the final decision about meal plans and their degree of adherence to these
guiding principles. The degree of compliance with each of these guiding principles was self-evaluated.
The major guiding principles of the dietary plans included:
1.
Adequate intake of a variety of vegetables (including leafy greens) and fruit (preferably whole fruit).
2.
Adequate protein quality and intake.
3.
Adequate, but not excessive, caloric intake.
4.
Minimal consumption of “junk” foods and replacement with healthy snacks.
5.
Healthy, gluten-free, casein-free, and soy-free (HGCSF).
6.
Avoidance of artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives.
2.12. Statistical Analysis
Different types of statistical analyses were used, depending on the research question being addressed.
For comparison of changes of behavioral symptoms of the treatment vs. non-treatment group, 1-sided
unpaired t-tests assuming unequal variance were used, since our hypothesis was that the treatment
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
12 of 43
group would improve more than the non-treatment group. For comparing changes in biomarkers,
2-sided unpaired t-tests comparisons assuming unequal variance were used. For individual comparisons,
a p-value of 0.05 or lower was assumed significant. No correction was made for multiple comparisons
since in most cases (such as vitamin measurements) there were a large number of significant findings.
This was an exploratory study, and future studies can use our results to make specific hypotheses and
appropriate statistical corrections for multiple hypotheses.

2.15. Non-Treatment Group
Thirty families started in the Non-treatment group, none dropped out, three were disqualified,
and 27 completed the study without making any major changes in their baseline treatments. This is an
unusually high percentage for a 120 month study, primarily due to the promise of receiving a full year
of free supplements if they waited.
Three participants were disqualified because they made significant changes to their baseline
treatments—one made a major diet change and added three psychiatric medications; one started
a developmental preschool at 10 h/week; one changed their school and home therapy program.
Also, one participant did only part of the final evaluation (ADOS/CARS-2/RIAS/SAS-Pro), but no
parent questionnaires or blood work due to parental issues.
3. Results
3.1. Adverse Effects
A few adverse effects were reported for some treatments.
Vitamin/Minerals: Two participants (brothers ages 7 and 12) had worsening behavior (moderate
severity) that was possibly due to the vitamin/mineral supplement, so after four months they stopped
use of all supplements and only implemented the healthy HGCSF diet (which was beneficial and
resolved severe pica in the seven-year-old). Our measurements found that they both had extremely
low cobalamin (4–5% of normal), and low levels of other nutrients compared to normal children,
including methylcobalmin (40–50% of normal), beta carotene (23–36% of normal), riboflavin (46–52%
of normal). The boy with pica also had low vitamin C (34% of normal), low nictotinic acid (29% of
normal), and low pantothenic acid (35% of normal). The boy without pica also had low levels of
folic acid (34% of normal). So, the very low level of cobalamin, and lower levels of other nutrients,
may have made them very sensitive to nutritional supplements, and/or they may have an underlying
metabolic problem with cobalamin. It seems likely that these nutritional deficiencies also contributed
to the severe pica in one of the boys.
Carnitine: One participant reported that the carnitine made their child feel sick, so they discontinued it.
Digestive Enzymes: One participant was not able to tolerate the digestive enzyme due to intestinal
symptoms, and stopped taking it after one month. One participant developed a facial rash after
extended use of the digestive enzyme, and eventually discontinued it despite reporting improvements
in constipation and behavior.
Healthy HGCSF diet: One parent reported that implementation of the diet in a strict manner
resulted in increased aggression towards peers, inability to problem solve, and increased spinning
behavior, probably due to frustration in regards to removal of favorite foods.
No adverse events were reported with the essential fatty acids or Epsom salt bath.
About 20% of the participants complained about the taste of the unflavored vitamin/mineral
supplement and/or the fish oil, but mixing it with juice helped in most cases, and a capsule form of
the vitamin/mineral supplement was made available to some families who preferred this form of
delivery. A few participants had temporary mild nausea, and one child had loose stools, but lowering
the dosage resolved those concerns.
3.2. Compliance
Compliance with taking the supplements and following the diet was self-reported by participants
at the end of the study. The percentages of families who missed doses 1×/week or less was 85% for
the vitamin/mineral supplement, 89% for the essential fatty acids, 82% for the carnitine, and 78% for
the digestive enzymes. For the vitamin/mineral supplement, one child took only 2/3 of the full dose,
and one child took 3/4 of the full dose. One child did not take the carnitine supplement, and two did
not take the digestive enzymes.
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
14 of 43
For compliance with a healthy diet, 7% of families reported they had only 60% compliance,
60% reported they had 80% compliance, and 33% reported they had 90% or higher compliance.
Most noncompliance was reported as occurring at school or with care providers other than the
primary parent.
For compliance with a HGCSF diet, 61% reported < 1 exposure per month, 14% reported one
exposure per week, 18% reported 1–2 exposures/week, and 7% reported reduced intake of gluten,
casein, and soy but did not eliminate it. Families reported that compliance with the diet was the
hardest part of the treatment protocol to follow.
3.3. Highlights

were significantly different between the treatment and non-treatment groups for the major assessments.

difference on the Verbal IQ test or the Memory test. It is noted that at baseline the treatment group 
had a lower score than the non‐treatment group on the Non‐Verbal IQ test (p < 0.05), which was a 
random difference between the groups as a result of the randomization process.

Figure 4. CARS‐2 scores at beginning and end of the study. The scale goes from 15 to 60, with scores 
of approximately 27 and above being the cut‐off for ASD. Error bars represent standard deviations. 
3.5.2. Severity of Autism Scale—Professional Evaluation (SAS‐Pro)  
The treatment group improved somewhat more than the non‐treatment group on the SAS‐Pro 
as rated by our clinical evaluator, and the difference was significant (−0.93 ± 1.2 vs. −0.33 ± 0.12,  
p = 0.04), see Table 4 and Figure 5. These changes correspond to a 13% and 6% decrease in SAS‐Pro 
scores, respectively. 
The RIAS was single‐blinded, and the CARS‐2 and SAS‐Pro were semi‐blinded (evaluator was 
blinded, participants were not). For the RIAS, higher numbers mean more ability, with 100 being 
average for the general population. For the CARS‐2 and SAS‐Pro, higher numbers mean worse 
problems. #—For the CARS‐2, since the lowest possible scores is a 15, the % change is relative to that 
baseline of 15.

3.5.3. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II (VABS-II)
For the average developmental age of the Communication, Social, and Daily Living domains,
the treatment group improved significantly more than the non-treatment group (18.4 ± 16 months
vs. 4.3 ± 16 months, p = 0.008), see Table 5 and Figure 6. The treatment group improved significantly
more on the Communication, Daily Living Skills, and Social Skills Domains. For the 9 subscales,
the treatment group improved significantly more than the non-treatment group on four of them (Written
Skills, Domestic Skills, Interpersonal Relationships, Coping Skills) and marginally significant greater
improvement on three others (Receptive Skills and Expressive Skills, and Community Skills), but no
significant difference in Personal Daily Living Skills or Play/Leisure Skills—see Figure 7. For the Gross
Motor and Fine Motor subscales both groups had similar degrees of improvement, but it is important
to remember that 32% and 44% of the treatment and non-treatment groups, respectively, were at the
maximum score, so they could not improve more. Due to a combination of scheduling problems and
limited parental interest in the lengthy interview, pre and post VABS-II evaluations were completed
on only 60% of the treatment group and 59% of the non-treatment group. However, a comparison of
their PGI-2 scores shows little difference between those who did and did not complete both VABS-II
evaluations, so the limited number of evaluations did not seem to bias the results.

There were significantly greater improvements on the total score of the SRS for the treatment 
group compared to the non‐treatment group (−14% vs. −3%, p = 0.004), see Table 9 and Figure 11. The 
treatment group also had significantly greater improvements on four of the five subscales.

3.6.5. Short Sensory Profile (SSP)
There were significantly greater improvements on the total score of the SSP for the treatment
group compared to the non-treatment group (12% vs. 2%, p = 0.0003), see Table 10 and Figure 12.
The treatment group also had significantly greater improvements on five subscales (tactile sensitivity,
taste/smell sensitivity, under-responsiveness/seeks sensation, auditory filtering, and visual/auditory
sensitivity, p < 0.05), and greater but not-significant improvement on the other two subscales.

3.6.6. Parent Global Impressions—Revised‐2 (PGI‐2) 
Table 11 lists the number of participants in each group who had each symptom. At the end of  
12 months, there were significantly greater improvements on the Average Score of the PGI‐2 for the 
treatment group compared to the non‐treatment group (1.24 ± 0.74 vs. 0.08 ± 0.54, p < 0.00000001),  
see Table 11. The treatment group also had significantly greater improvements on 16 of the 17 individual 
areas.  
The PGI‐2 assesses change in symptoms (from beginning to end of study), using a scale ranging 
from −3 (much worse) to zero (no change) to 1 (slightly better), 2 (better), 3 (much better). The table 
lists the number of participants who had the symptom at the start of the study.  
PGI‐2 vs. Time: The PGI‐2 was also measured at 3, 6, and 9 months for the treatment group only, 
and the Average Score of the PGI‐2 is plotted in Figure 13. Most of the improvements in symptoms 
occurred during the first three months, with smaller improvements after that point.

This analysis was limited to the participants who had non‐zero Total Severity Scores on the

group). The treatment group improved more than the non‐treatment group on the total severity score 
(−30% vs. −10%, p = 0.05). The largest improvements were in constipation, diarrhea, and stool smell, 
see Table 12. Also, there were three participants who initially had zero scores on the 6‐GSI, but 
developed some GI symptoms at the end of the study (two participants in the treatment group had a

At the end of the study, families were asked to rate the estimated effect of each treatment, since the
treatments were started at least one month apart from one another, with the caveat that some treatments
may take longer than one month to have an effect so effects may overlap. Figure 14 plots the results.
The highest rated treatments were the vitamin/mineral supplement and the essential fatty acids,
followed by the Healthy HGCSF diets, followed by the carnitine, digestive enzymes, and Epsom
salt baths.

3.9. Treatment Continuation  
At the end of the study, families were asked which treatments they were going to continue when 
the study ended. Figure 15 plots the data. The vitamin/mineral supplement and the essential fatty 
acids were the most likely to be continued (>85%). 70% of families planned to continue the Epsom 
salt baths, 63% planned to continue the healthy HGCSF diet, and 44% planned to continue the 
carnitine and digestive enzymes.

Figure 15. Percentage of participants who plan to continue each treatment. 
3.10. Medical Tests 
3.10.1. Complete Blood Count (CBC) 
Most of the CBC measurements did not change significantly. The only significant differences 
were that the treatment group has a slight decrease in RBC and the non‐treatment group did not 
change (−2% vs. 0%, p = 0.04), and the treatment group had a very slight increase in mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV) and the non‐treatment group did not change (+1% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), see Table 14. 
3.10.2. Blood Chemistry Panel (ChemPanel) 
Most of the ChemPanel measurements did not change significantly, see Table 15. For Blood Urea 
Nitrogen (BUN), the treatment group had a small decrease and the non‐treatment group did not 
change (−16% vs. 5%, p = 0.01). For Serum Potassium, there was a slight decrease in the treatment 
group and little change in the non‐treatment group (−6% vs. −1%, p = 0.02).  
3.10.3. Body Mass Index (BMI) 
There was no significant difference in the change in the BMI of the treatment group (20.7 ± 5.3 
to 20.0 ± 4.6) compared to the change of the non‐treatment group (20.4 ± 5.5 to 19.9 ± 5.4). 
3.10.4. Fatty Acids 
The treatment group had large increases in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic 
acid (DHA) compared to the non‐treatment group (EPA, + 525% vs. +22%, p = 1 × 10−9, DHA: +83% vs. 
+13%, p = 1 × 10−9). The treatment group also had a small decrease in arachidonic acid (AA, −20% vs. 
−1%, p = 1 × 10−7), linoleic acid (−15% vs. −1%, p = 0.0001), dihomo‐γ‐linolenic acid (DGLA, −12% vs. 
+2%, p = 0.003), elaidic acid (−26% vs. −12%, p = 0.03), and palmitoleic acid (−13% vs. +11%, p = 0.01), 
see Table 16. 
Low initial levels of linoleic acid were inversely correlated with parents reports of Treatment 
Effectiveness of the EFA supplement (r = −0.55, p < 0.001). In other words, the group reporting the 
most improvement on the EFA supplement tended to be those with the lowest initial levels of linoleic 
acid. There were no other significant correlations of improvement with the EFA supplement and 
levels of other PUFAs.

acid. There were no other significant correlations of improvement with the EFA supplement and levels
of other PUFAs.
3.10.5. C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
There was no significant difference between the change in CRP in the treatment and non-
treatment groups.
3.10.6. Vitamins
For the treatment group compared to the non-treatment group there were large and significant
increases in biomarkers for Vitamin B2 (riboflavin, +268% vs. −17%, p = 0.00000002), B5 (pantothenic
acid, +351% vs. +90%, p = 0.0002), folic acid (folic acid, +119% vs. −34%, p = 0.02), and CoQ10H2 (the
reduced form of CoQ10, +72% vs. −19%, p = 0.001; no significant change in the oxidized form, CoQ10).
There was a large increase in one biomarker of vitamin B6 (4-pyridoxic +435% vs. +6%, p = 0.0000006),
but only a small increase in another biomarker (pyridoxine, +25% vs. −33%, p = 0.008). There were
moderate increases in one form of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin, +44% vs. −5%, p = 0.006) but not in
another (methylcobalamin), see Table 17. There were no significant changes in the other biomarkers.
3.10.7. RBC Elements
There was a significant increase in selenium (+5% vs. −8%, p = 0.001) and chromium (+18% vs.
−16%, p = 0.05) in the treatment group compared to the non-treatment group, see Table 18. There were
no significant changes in other minerals.
3.10.8. Homocysteine Pathway
For the treatment group compared to the non-treatment group, there was a significantly larger
decrease (improvement) in homocysteine (−29% vs. −7%, p = 0.00002), resulting in normal levels;
see Table 19. There were no significant changes in cysteine or methionine.
3.10.9. Carnitine
There was a significant increase in L-carnitine in the treatment group compared to the
non-treatment group (+20% vs. −5%, p = 0.03), see Table 20. There was a non-significant increase
in acetyl-L-carnitine in the treatment group compared to the non-treatment group (+32% vs. +4%,
n.s.). The parent rating of Treatment Effectiveness for carnitine had a modest, non-significant inverse
correlation (r = −0.29) with initial levels or the level of acetyl-carnitine.

3.11. Case Studies
There were also 3 exceptional cases of improvement during the study, all of which occurred in the
treatment group.
3.11.1. Case Study A
Increase in Physical Strength/Endurance/Energy: Participant A was a 9-year-old female with
severe ASD, moderately overweight (BMI = 31.5), and very low strength, endurance, and energy level.
She could not get in/out of the family van, climb stairs, or get up off the floor by herself, and had a
low activity level overall. She could only walk a quarter mile before sitting and refusing to get up,
so a wheelchair was used for outings. Around four months after treatment started her strength and
endurance began to improve significantly, and by 6–12 months into the study she was able to get in/out
of the van, walk up/down stairs, walk two miles, and attend outings without tiring. The wheelchair
was put in storage and no longer needed. Her overall energy level increased substantially to the level
when she was a toddler, and she began to skip around the house. Her diet had been self-limited with
total avoidance of beef and pork products (the main dietary sources of carnitine), and her improvement
seemed to primarily change with the addition of high-dose carnitine at 4 months into the study.
An in-depth assessment of her carnitine status revealed that, averaging over measurements of 37
different types of carnitine (acetyl-carnitine species), her pre-treatment levels averaged only 68% of
normal, and after treatment they averaged 18% above normal. So, low carnitine seems likely to have
contributed to her challenges, and carnitine supplementation seems to have helped.
3.11.2. Case Study B
Complete Resolution of Inability to Urinate: Participant B was a 27-year-old male with severe
ASD and a history of severe urinary retention and occasional kidney stones for three years, requiring
daily catheterization and occasional hospitalization. The cause was unknown and assumed to be
neurological. Previous treatment with Flomax and Bethanecol was ineffective. The daily intermittent
catheterization caused much discomfort to the subject, including bouts of urinary tract infections,
bladder infections and irritation of the external urethral orifice, requiring numerous treatments with
oral antibiotics and antifungals. His parents reported “His quality of life and social activity were
much diminished. In addition, behavioral issues started to emerge, including an obsession with the
constant touching of his genitals (probably initially caused by irritation which then evolved into a
stimulative behavior). This became a huge problem when out in public, around peers and with his
family members”.
As step one of a HGCSF diet, the subject was taken off all dairy products. Approximately four
days after all dairy had been removed from his diet, the subject spontaneously went to the restroom
and urinated on his own. He continued to be able to urinate on his own numerous times a day to
the point where catheterization was no longer required. About three weeks after the subject had
been taken off dairy products, he accidentally ate ice-cream, and the subject immediately ceased
to be able to urinate on his own, returning to the necessity of daily intermittent catheterization.
After approximately four days after eating the ice cream, the subject once again started spontaneously
urinating on his own without assistance. He continued to be able to urinate on his own, eliminating
the need for catheterization. Approximately four months after dairy had been removed from his diet,
he accidentally ate cheese, upon which the subject once again lost the ability to urinate on his own,
requiring intermittent catheterization. After approximately four days the subject started spontaneously
urinating on his own again. The participant remained completely dairy-free for the remainder of the
study, and continued to be able to urinate on his own and catheterization was no longer required,
and there were zero episodes of kidney stones, urinary tract infections, bladder infections or urethral
irritation. His parents reported that “his quality of life has improved dramatically and all behavior
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
33 of 43
issues, including the constant touching of his genitals, have ceased. His social interactions with his
peers and family members have improved dramatically and he is overall a much happier person”.
3.11.3. Case Study C
Complete resolution of Pica: Participant C was a seven-year-old boy with severe pica. Within one
week of starting the HGCSF diet there was a complete resolution of the pica which continued until the
end of the study. Note that at baseline this boy had low levels of many nutrients compared to typical
children, including: cobalamin (5% of normal), methylcobalamin (49%), beta-carotene (23%), nicotinic
acid (29%), vitamin C (34%), pantothenic acid (35%), and riboflavin (52%). It seems likely that the
severe pica was due to many significant nutritional deficiencies, and possibly a metabolic problem
with cobalamin absorption or conversion.
4. Discussion
4.1. Blinded Evaluations (RIAS)
The significant improvement on the nonverbal IQ test suggests a substantial improvement in
cognitive function. The verbal IQ did not change, perhaps because significant impairments in language
remained. Since the RIAS evaluator was completely blinded, and the RIAS test is highly standardized,
this increase in nonverbal IQ appears to be real. The improvement in nonverbal IQ is consistent with
the much higher ratings of improvement in cognition on the PGI-2 for the treatment group vs. the
non-treatment group (1.57 ± 0.9 vs. 0.38 ± 0.7). The magnitude of the effect is clinically significant: on
the PGI-2 cognition question, 53% of treatment group were rated as better (39%) or much better (14%),
vs. only 8% of the non-treatment group were rated as better, and none were rated much better.
4.2. Semi-Blinded Evaluations (V
ABS-II, CARS-2, SAS-Pro)
During the 12 months of treatment, the non-treatment group gained only 4 months of development
on the VABS-II, consistent with a major developmental delay. In contrast, the treatment group
gained an average of 18 months of development, with substantial improvements in many areas.
However, their average developmental age still remained well below their biological age, so that they
were still significantly impaired. This is consistent with modest but significant improvements on the
CARS-2 and SAS-Pro.
4.3. Unblinded Parent/Self Evaluations (PDD-BI, ATEC, ABC, SRS, SSP, PGI-2, 6-GSI)
As mentioned previously, these unblinded evaluations are somewhat affected by a “placebo”
effect, so the improvements reported represent an “upper bound” on the actual degree of benefit.
The use of a non-treatment group provides some control for normal developmental improvement over
the 12 months of the study. For the non-treatment group, it is interesting to note that there were some
small improvements in several of the assessments (<10%, see Figure 2). However, the treatment group
improved significantly more than the non-treatment group on all of the ASD/behavioral assessments.
4.4. GI Symptoms
The treatment group had significantly more improvement than the non-treatment group on the
6-GSI, primarily due to improvements in constipation, diarrhea, and stool smell. This is consistent
with the PGI-2 subscale for Stool/GI symptoms, which found that the treatment group improved
much more than the non-treatment group (approximately “slightly better (0.94) vs. “no change (−0.11),
see Table 11. This is also consistent with a significant reduction in constipation symptoms (−48%
vs. −13%, p = 0.003) reported as one question on the ATEC (only evaluating those with initial mild,
moderate, or severe constipation—19 in the treatment group, and 17 in the non-treatment group).
The ATEC did not show a significant difference in diarrhea. Overall, these three assessments suggest
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
34 of 43
that there was a significant improvement in GI symptoms in the treatment group compared to the
non-treatment group.
4.5. Handgrip Strength
Both groups had only a small increase in handgrip strength, consistent with what might be
expected by 12 months of development, but no significant difference between them and not enough to
catch up to their peers.
4.6. Treatment Effectiveness and Continuation
The parents rated the vitamin/mineral supplement (started day 0) and the EFAs (started day 30) as
the two most effective treatments, which is consistent with Figure 14 showing that most improvement
occurred during the first three months of treatment. This is also consistent with those two treatments
being rated by parents as the most likely treatments to continue. There was also a small increase
in the PGI-2 between months 9–12, presumably due to the start of the healthy HGCSF diet on day
210. It should be noted that compliance with the healthy HGCSF diet was lower than for the other
treatments, so benefit might have been somewhat larger if compliance was higher.
4.7. Medical Tests
The CBC, ChemPanel, and BMI results demonstrated that the treatment combination was generally
safe, consistent with the modest number and modest intensity of adverse effects. There was no
significant change in CRP, a general marker of inflammation, but levels at the start of the study were
not significantly different between the ASD and neurotypical groups.
4.7.1. PUFAs
The PUFA test results demonstrate compliance with consumption of the EFA supplement, and
demonstrate a large effect on PUFA levels in RBC. It should be noted that the EFA supplement included
mostly omega-3 fatty acids (609 mg/capsule), but also some omega-6 fatty acids (198 mg/capsule).
The percentage increase in EPA (+525%) was approximately 6 times higher than the increase in DHA
(+83%), which is consistent with the composition of the fish oil used in this study (approximately 4:1
EPA:DHA). Conversely, there were small but significant decreases in linoleic acid, dihomo-γ-linolenic
acid (DGLA), and arachidonic acid (AA); those small decreases may be partly due to competitive
absorption with the omega-3 fatty acids, and partly due to competition for delta-5-saturase and
delta-6-desaturases. Those desaturases are shared among omega-3, -6, and -9 fatty acids, and the
desaturases have a preference in the order of omega 3-> omega-6 > omega-9. So, giving large amounts
of omega-3 decreases the availability of the desaturases for omega-6 and omega-9, so less linoleic
acid is converted to DGLA and AA. The decrease in arachidonic acid likely results in less production
of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, and that decrease is likely beneficial for some children with ASD.
Similarly, the increase in oleic acid (non-significant) and significant decreases in elaidic and palmitoleic
are also likely partly due to increased competition for the desaturases, so that less oleic is converted to
elaidic and palmitoleic; elaidic and possibly palmitoleic are harmful trans-fats. It is also possible that
the HGCSF diet, which recommended avoiding “junk food”, also helped decrease the level of elaidic
acid, which is the most common trans-fat in hydrogenated vegetable oils.
Overall, the increases in EPA and DHA, and decreases in AA and elaidic acid, are very positive,
and likely reduce inflammation throughout the body.
4.7.2. Vitamins
The treatment group had significant improvements in the level of many vitamins (B2, B5, B6,
folic acid, B12 (as cyanocobalamin), and CoQ10H2), but not all vitamins. This suggests that larger doses
and/or more bioavailable forms of the other vitamins are needed to have a significant effect on blood
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
35 of 43
levels, and larger doses/absorption may in some cases result in greater therapeutic benefit. It also
suggests that the methylcobalamin was not absorbed, and that cyanocobalamin was not converted to
methylcobalamin in plasma, but this conversion can occur intracellularly, and the improvement in
homocysteine (which requires methyl-B12) suggests that this conversion occurred. For future studies
we recommend increasing the level of vitamin D, since the current supplement did not increase levels
significantly despite supplementation levels well above the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
for vitamin D, and other studies of even higher doses of vitamin D for ASD reported significant
benefits [75,76].
4.7.3. Essential Elements (“Minerals”)
The treatment group had minor increases in selenium and chromium, and no other significant
changes. There were no significant differences in the levels of essential elements between the ASD
and neurotypical group at the start of the study, and only modest dosages of minerals were given in
the vitamin/mineral supplement. Since the body can regulate levels of most essential minerals by
adjusting absorption and excretion based on current mineral levels, it is not surprising that there was
little significant effect of modest mineral supplementation when mineral levels on average are in the
normal range.
4.7.4. Homocysteine
Compared to the non-treatment group, the treatment group had a significant decrease in
homocysteine, resulting in levels similar to (slightly below) the neurotypical group. This is presumably
partly due to the supplementation with folinic acid and vitamin B12, which are enzymatic cofactors for
recycling homocysteine to methionine, and partly due to supplementation with vitamin B6, which is
the enzymatic co-factor for converting homocysteine to cystathionine, and for converting cystathionine
to cysteine.
4.7.5. Carnitine
The carnitine test results demonstrated that both groups started at levels similar to the
neurotypical controls, and the treatment resulted in a significant increase in L-carnitine, and a similar
non-significant increase in acetyl-L-carnitine. Since the carnitine supplementation was primarily
acetyl-L-carnitine (there was a small amount of L-carnitine in the vitamin/mineral supplement),
this suggests inter-conversion between the two forms, as expected. However, the increase in plasma
carnitine was only approximately 25%, which was less compared to another study [50] which used an
equivalent dosage of L-carnitine and found a 70% increase in total carnitine in plasma, and another
study using twice the dosage of L-carnitine found even higher increases in carnitine levels [51].
Comparing the results of the present study with the other two ASD studies suggests that L-carnitine
may be better absorbed than acetyl-L-carnitine, and hence may be more effective. Indeed, L-carnitine
supplementation was found to result in several significant improvements in symptoms in children
with ASD in two other randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [50,51], whereas the
benefit in this study seemed to be more modest (see Table 20). Also, initial levels of plasma carnitine
were not good predictors of parents’ ratings of Treatment Effectiveness of carnitine—we hypothesize
that intracellular levels may be better predictors.
4.7.6. Digestive Enzymes
The digestive enzymes were not rated as highly as the three top-rated treatments. One randomized,
double-blind study did find that digestive enzymes were helpful for autism [74], but another similar
study did not find significant benefit [57]. So, it may be that the particular blend of digestive enzymes
is important.
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
36 of 43
4.8. Case Studies
The three case studies suggest that nutritional deficiencies and/or food intolerances can have
significant effects, and the comprehensive nutritional/dietary treatment protocol is a safe and effective
way to identify and treat some intractable problems.
4.9. Age Effects
An evaluation of changes on all the outcome measures suggests that there was no significant
correlation of benefits with age, so children and adults of all ages are likely to benefit from this
combination treatment.
4.10. Developmental History
An evaluation of changes on all the outcome measures for the early-onset group vs. the regression/
plateau group did not reveal significant differences between the groups, but the sample size of
each subgroup is small so only large differences could be observed. So, it appears that individuals
with early-onset autism and regressive autism are both likely to benefit from this comprehensive
nutritional treatment.
4.11. Age and Gender Sub-Analysis
For age, there was a small correlation of adjusted age vs. change in CARS (r = −0.43) and average
PGI-R 2 (r = 0.40), suggesting the older participants improved somewhat more, but there was no
correlation of adjusted age vs. the other measures (CARS, SRS, SSP, ATEC, ABC, PDD-BI, Vineland,
PSAS, RIAS (VIX, NIX, CMX)). So, overall, age was not associated with degree of change, and all ages
(children and adults) seemed to improve approximately the same.
For gender, there were no significant differences on any of the behavioral assessments when
comparing males vs. females. The males improved slightly more on ABC, RIAS (NIX), PDD-BI,
and ATEC, and the females improved slightly more on SSP, PGI-R2, PSAS and Vineland, but these
differences were not significant. The other behavioral assessments (ADOS, SRS, CARS, and RIAS
(CMX, CIX and VIX)) were similar between males and females (less than 5% difference).
4.12. Limitations and Strengths
This study was designed to assess the possible benefits of a comprehensive nutritional and dietary
intervention. A strength of the study is that it was a randomized, controlled study, but a major
limitation of this study is that implementation of a healthy, HGCSF diet does not allow blinding of
participants. The RIAS evaluation was single-blinded, and the CARS and SAS-Pro were semi-blinded
(the evaluators were blinded, the participants were not), so those results are fairly robust. The parent
evaluations certainly are subject to some placebo-effect but provide an upper-bound on possible
benefits. The laboratory measurements were conducted in a blinded manner, so those results should
be reliable.
A strength of this study is the long-term nature (12 months), allowing a fuller determination of
possible benefits and adverse effects, which is important since the effect of nutritional interventions
is likely slower than the effect of pharmaceutical interventions, and since individuals with autism
often use nutritional supplements for long periods. The study was primarily designed to evaluate the
cumulative effect of all of the treatments, but the sequential administration of treatments provided
some insight into the relative merits of the individual treatments. A limitation of this study is its
exploratory nature, so that sample size estimates were not made formally due to lack of information
on the effect size of the combined treatment protocol.
A limitation of this study is that all participants received all treatments, whereas probably
only a subset are likely to benefit from any single intervention (for example, only participants
with low carnitine are likely to benefit from carnitine supplementation). Unfortunately, in many
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
37 of 43
cases we do not have reliable biomarkers to accurately predict who is likely to benefit from a given
intervention. So, this study used a comprehensive nutritional and dietary intervention approach,
so that all participants were provided with all therapies, even though a given participant might only
benefit from a subset of those interventions. Future studies could try to determine which treatments
were most beneficial, using the results of this study to guide those future studies.
4.13. Relevance to Clinical Practice
The individual treatments used in this study have been used in previous studies, and were generally
well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects. This study demonstrates that the combination of all of
those treatments is feasible for most families, again with minimal adverse effects. The HGCSF diet had
the lowest compliance, but still most families managed to implement the diet successfully. The number
of pills required for all of the supplements was also a concern for some families, but splitting them
up into 2–3 times/day made it manageable for most participants. Figure 15 demonstrates that most
families wanted to continue with most treatments. So, we believe that the treatments used here should
be considered for use in clinical practice for most children and adults with ASD.
4.14. Suggestions for Future Research
The results of this study strongly suggest that future similar studies are warranted, with a focus on
vitamins/minerals, essential fatty acids, and HGCSF diet. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
study design could be considered if the diet portion is not included. More extensive biochemical
measurements, including metabolomics, may help determine how to optimize vitamin/mineral
supplements and other treatments. For essential fatty acids, higher doses may be warranted, as even
higher doses are used for improving cardiac health. For carnitine, switching to L-carnitine may improve
benefit. For digestive enzymes, it appears more research is needed to improve them. For Epsom salt
baths, it was previously shown that the vitamin/mineral supplement (with MSM, a source of sulfate)
was only partially able to improve levels of plasma sulfate [15], and biochemical measures are needed
to determine if the addition of the Epsom salt baths was sufficient to meet biological needs for sulfate,
the fourth most abundant mineral in the body.
5. Conclusions
The study results suggest that the comprehensive nutrition/diet protocol was safe and effective.
The nutritional supplements and healthy diet improved nutritional status, and hence presumably
increased the brains ability to function and learn. This is supported by the increase in non-verbal
IQ, and the substantial 18-month increase in developmental ability in communication, daily living
skills, and social skills. Modest improvements in CARS-2 and SAS-Pro suggest some reduction in
autism symptoms, consistent with parent reports of improvements on the PDD-BI, ATEC, and SRS.
Parent reports also suggest improvements in aberrant behaviors (ABC—Irritability, Lethargy/Social
Withdrawal, Stereotypy, and Hyperactivity), sensory processing (SSP), and GI symptoms (6-GSI, PGI-2,
ATEC), and Overall (PGI-2). There was not a significant effect on handgrip strength. The treatment
efficacy seemed to be similar for both genders and all ages, probably because nutritional requirements
are similar for both genders and all ages (after normalizing for caloric intake).
The three unusual case reports, in which three very different long-term problems were greatly
improved, shows the power of comprehensive nutritional interventions in addressing complex,
puzzling medical conditions which may involve one or more nutritional deficiencies.
There were many significant increases in vitamins, essential fatty acids, and carnitine, and an
improvement in homocysteine. The vitamin/mineral supplement and essential fatty acids appeared
to have the most clinical benefit, although other treatments appeared to have some benefit for some
individuals. So, this comprehensive treatment approach is recommended as a promising therapy for
children and adults with ASD, with an emphasis on the vitamin/mineral supplement and essential
fatty acids as probably being the most helpful.
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 369
38 of 43
The data also suggests some possible improvements could be made to the treatment combination.
Specifically, it appears that L-carnitine may be better absorbed than acetyl-L-carnitine. Also, although
many vitamins were well-absorbed, larger doses and/or more bioavailable forms of the other vitamins
are needed to have a significant effect on blood levels, and larger doses/absorption may in some cases
result in greater therapeutic benefit. So, it seems likely that the current treatment protocol could be
further improved by making these changes.

assessments. K.L., J.C.N. and R.K.N. conducted the measurements of vitamins and carnitine. D.M.C. led the final
data entry and assisted with the data analysis. D.W.Q. oversaw the measurements at Doctor’s Data and assisted
with interpreting the results.
Conflicts of Interest: J.B.A. is the president of the Autism Nutrition Research Center (ANRC), a non-profit
which provides information to autism families and which produces an improved version of the vitamin/mineral
supplement used in this study. He serves as an unpaid volunteer, and does not receive any royalties from the sale
of the vitamin/mineral supplement. T.A. consults for Health Diagnostics, a commercial testing lab. D.W.Q. works
at Doctor’s Data, a commercial testing lab. The other authors do not have any competing interests.
