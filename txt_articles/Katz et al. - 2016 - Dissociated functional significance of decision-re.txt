Abstract
During decision-making, neurons in multiple brain regions exhibit responses that are correlated 
with decisions1-6. However, it remains uncertain whether or not various forms of decision-related 
activity are causally related to decision-making7-9. Here we address this question by recording and 
reversibly inactivating the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas of rhesus 
macaques performing a motion direction discrimination task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited firing 
rate patterns that directly resembled the evidence accumulation process posited to govern decision 
making2,10, with strong correlations between their response fluctuations and the animal's choices. 
Neurons in area MT, in contrast, exhibited weak correlations between their response fluctuations 
and animal choices, and had firing rate patterns consistent with their sensory role in motion 
encoding1. The behavioral impact of pharmacological inactivation of each area was inversely 
related to their degree of decision-related activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT profoundly 
impaired psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no measurable impact on decision-
making performance, despite having silenced the very clusters that exhibited strong decision-
related activity. Although LIP inactivation did not impair psychophysical behavior, it did influence 
spatial selection and oculomotor metrics in a free-choice control task. The absence of an effect on 
perceptual decision-making was stable over trials and sessions, arguing against several forms of 
compensation, and was robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry. Thus, decision-
related signals in LIP do not appear to be necessary for computing perceptual decisions. Our 
findings highlight a dissociation between decision correlation and causation, showing that strong 
neuron-decision correlations may reflect secondary or epiphenomenal signals, and do not 
necessarily offer direct access to the neural computations underlying decisions.

 We investigated the functional significance of decision-related activity by recording and 
inactivating neural activity in two well-studied cortical areas, MT and LIP, while rhesus 
monkeys performed a challenging motion discrimination task. On each trial, the monkey 
maintained stable visual fixation while discriminating the net direction of a visual motion 
stimulus, and then made a saccade to one of two choice targets to communicate their choice 
(Fig. 1a, b). For electrophysiological recordings in MT, we placed the motion stimulus in the 
receptive field of the neurons and aligned it with the preferred direction of one or more MT 
neurons on the multi-electrode array. For LIP, we placed one of the two targets in the 
response field of the neurons (as opposed to the visual motion stimulus), and the other target 
on the contralateral side of the visual field, consistent with previous studies of decision-
related responses in LIP 11.
We recorded 157 MT neurons and 200 LIP neurons with either single electrodes or multi-
electrode linear arrays. MT neurons that were well-targeted by the stimulus (n = 94) had 
average firing rates that depended on the motion strength and direction (Figure 1c). As 
expected in this area, responses increased sharply after motion onset and maintained a robust 
firing rate throughout motion viewing12. The average responses of well-targeted LIP neurons 
(n = 113) were also consistent with classical observations2,11, exhibiting ramp-like increases 
or decreases in firing rate whose slopes were proportional to motion strength, the primary 
physiological characteristic implicating LIP in reflecting the accumulation of evidence over 
time (Fig. 1d).
We further quantified the decision-related activity of MT and LIP using choice probability1 
(CP), a measure of correlation between neural activity and choice behavior, independent of 
stimulus-driven responses. MT neurons were weakly but reliably correlated with the 
animal's choice on a trial-by-trial basis (mean CP = 0.54, p = 1e-5; Fig. 1e). LIP neurons 
were more strongly correlated with choices (mean CP = 0.70, p = 1e-21; Fig. 1f). Thus, the 
stimulus-dependent responses and choice probability in MT were consistent with its well-
established role in representing the motion stimulus, and the response patterns in LIP 
resembled the timecourse of an evolving decision process. Together, these properties have 
given rise to a model where LIP neurons either integrate, or reflect the integration of, motion 
evidence from area MT in favor of a decision11,13.
Having confirmed the neurophysiological properties of areas MT and LIP and their 
differential degrees of correlations with decisions, we tested their respective causal 
contributions by performing reversible inactivations in each area and evaluating the impacts 
on psychophysical performance (hypothesized outcomes shown in Fig. 2a). We infused 
muscimol (a GABA-A agonist which hyperpolarizes cell bodies but not fibers of passage14) 
into either MT or LIP, 1mm away from a multi-electrode array (Fig. 2b). The injection 
cannula was targeted to locations that had yielded the largest number of canonical MT or 
LIP units during recording sessions (Extended Data Fig. 1). The multi-electrode array was 
used to confirm both pre-infusion physiological properties and post-infusion neural 
silencing, performed on every inactivation session. Silencing was typically observed across 
all recording channels of the array (Fig. 2b) and estimated to span a spherical volume of 
∼2.5mm radius (see Methods).

 Inactivations in area MT exerted large effects on psychophysical performance. The motion 
stimulus was placed within a region of visual space retinotopically matched to the 
inactivated population of MT neurons (Fig. 2c). MT inactivations (n = 6; monkey N, 3; 
monkey P, 3) had a large and consistent impact on direction discrimination sensitivity 
(68.5% reduction from baseline, t(5) = -9.7, p = 0.002, paired t test). When the motion 
stimulus was moved outside the inactivated region within the same session (n = 3), 
psychophysical performance was restored, confirming that the effects were not due to 
general changes in arousal or vigilance (Extended Data Figure 2). These severe and specific 
impairments in direction discrimination performance were consistent with prior causal 
perturbations15,16.
In contrast, inactivations in area LIP (n = 21; monkey N, 12; monkey P, 9) did not exert 
compelling or substantial effects on psychophysical performance (Fig. 2d). In these 
experiments, we placed one choice target in the inactivated region of visual space, in line 
with previous electrophysiological investigations that placed a choice target (and not the 
visual motion stimulus) in the response fields of LIP neurons to elicit the area's canonical 
decision-related responses. Although we performed large inactivations in locations where 
LIP electrophysiology had mirrored the accumulation of evidence and demonstrated strong 
decision-related activity, we did not detect significant changes in either the animal's 
sensitivity or bias, as indicated by statistically-indistinguishable differences in the slope 
(3.7% reduction from baseline, t(20) = -1.4, p = 0.16, paired t test) or midpoint (-0.4% shift, 
t(20) = -0.08, p = 0.93, paired t test) of the psychometric functions. Saline and sham control 
experiments showed similar patterns to the main baseline vs. muscimol treatment 
comparison (Extended Data Table 1). Thus, while the impact of MT inactivation on 
sensitivity was substantial, an effect of LIP inactivation was not clearly identifiable using our 
techniques and task (Fig. 2e).
We also assessed whether inactivation affected the timing or strategy of evidence 
integration8,17,18. For example, if LIP supported the temporal integration of motion 
evidence, inactivation could alter the strategy to reflect “leakier” integration that might still 
support the same overall performance. Contrary to this possibility, inactivation in LIP did 
not lead to greater reliance on either early or late information (Fig. 2f and 2g), estimated via 
reverse correlation. Inactivations in area MT, in contrast, reduced the psychophysical 
weighting of motion roughly evenly over time.
Although inactivation in LIP had no measurable effect on direction discrimination, it did 
exert effects on a “free-choice” control task, which was performed on every inactivation 
session (Fig 3a and 3b). LIP inactivation biased choices away from the contralateral 
hemifield (8.88% reduction from baseline on average, t(33) = 3.4, p = 0.001, paired t test), 
(Fig. 3c and 3d), consistent with previous reports in monkeys19-21, rodents8, and parietal 
lesions in humans22. Thus, our electrophysiological confirmation of LIP inactivation was 
complemented by a behavioral consequence in this free-choice control task. In addition to 
causing a spatial bias, LIP inactivation led to an increase in endpoint error of saccades made 
to the hemifield contralateral to inactivation (0.36° on average, t(33) = 4.4, p < 0.0001, Fig. 
3c and 3d). No systematic change was detected in other oculomotor metrics during the free-
choice task (reaction time, peak velocity, or duration), and no effects on any oculomotor

 metrics were detected during the direction discrimination task. Despite observing a 
muscimol-induced effect in the free-choice task, effect magnitude in the free-choice task was 
not predictive of effect magnitude in the direction discrimination task (Extended Data Fig. 
3a,b), nor was there a dose-response relationship between muscimol mass and behavioral 
performance (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e), suggesting that our large muscimol administrations 
were likely operating within a “ceiling” regime.
Because muscimol inactivations require comparisons across relatively long time scales, it 
remains logically possible that LIP normally plays a critical role in decision making, but that 
other areas are processing information in parallel and are able to quickly compensate when it 
is artificially inactivated. Although other techniques with faster time scales will allow for 
more direct tests of this possibility, we did not observe changes indicative of compensation 
either within a session or over sessions (Extended Data Fig. 4 and 5, respectively). We also 
tested for compensation involving the non-inactivated hemisphere23. We performed 6 
inactivation experiments with both choice targets placed in a single hemifield (Fig 3e, inset), 
in order to maximize reliance on a single LIP and minimize involvement of the other 
hemisphere. Inactivation of the LIP corresponding to the two targets did not produce clear 
changes in behavioural performance (Fig 3e), indicating that inter-hemispheric 
compensation was unlikely in our main experiments. Previous LIP inactivation studies also 
find no evidence in support of compensation that manifests behaviourally (see Spatial and 
temporal extent of inactivation, Methods). We also found no disruption of decision making 
performance using the moving-dot stimulus used in previous studies of MT and LIP function 
during decision-making2,15 (Extended Data Fig. 6c).
Our results reveal a dissociation between decision-related activity in LIP and the causal role 
of such activity in decision-making. Instead, decision-related signals in LIP may be a result 
of feedback24, or an emergent phenomenon driven by extensive training25. Although one 
prior study observed effects of LIP microstimulation in a reaction time direction 
discrimination task26, such electrical perturbations can produce orthodromic (and 
antidromic) activation of connected areas, and their observed effects are reconcilable with 
multiple alternatives to evidence accumulation6. It remains possible that LIP contributes to 
decision-making in conjunction with associated brain regions, whose parallel and/or 
redundant processing simply renders LIP non-necessary in the particular tasks used to study 
its decision-related activity. Indeed, a growing body of work has observed decision-related 
activity in other brain areas3-6,9, consistent with the prospect of LIP playing a minor and/or 
nonessential role in decision-making. Our results mirror findings in rodent posterior parietal 
cortex, where inactivations did not affect decision-making despite electrophysiological 
correlates of evidence accumulation 8. Finally, a richer appreciation of LIP's contributions to 
decision-making might be gleaned from placing the motion stimulus itself (as opposed to the 
saccadic choice target) within the inactivated field, a configuration studied 
electrophysiologically in a categorization task27 but not yet causally investigated.
Taken together, decision-related activity is likely represented broadly across the brain, and 
may be “read out” by a flexible process to support behavior, in LIP or elsewhere7,18,28. Our 
results call for a broader consideration of both decision-making circuitry and the

 mechanisms for reading out decision-related activity— regardless of whether decisions are 
conveniently reflected, or actually computed, in the activity of a particular brain area23,29,30.
Methods
Monkey preparation
We performed electrophysiological recordings and reversible inactivations in the middle 
temporal (MT) and the lateral intraparietal (LIP) cortices of two rhesus macaques (subject N 
and subject P), female and male, aged 10 and 14 years, weighing 7.7 and 10 kg, respectively. 
Subject N had a custom titanium chamber that enabled access to both MT and LIP on the 
right hemisphere (L9, P2), guided by MRI. Subject P had a cilux chamber (Crist 
Instruments) over the right LIP (L12, P5) and another over the left V1 for a posterior 
approach to MT (L17, P17). Standard surgical procedures were applied31. All experimental 
protocols were approved by The University of Texas Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee and in accordance with National Institute of Health standards for care and use of 
laboratory animals.
The subject sat comfortably while head-posted in a primate chair (Crist Instruments), facing 
a linearized 55 inch LCD (LG) monitor (resolution = 1920 × 1080p, refresh rate = 60Hz, 
background luminance = 26.49 cd/m2) at a distance of 118cm, in a dark room. Eye position 
was recorded using an Eyelink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research), sampled at 1 kHz. A 
solenoid-operated reward system was used to deliver liquid reward to the monkey. Stimuli 
were generated by using the Psychophysics Toolbox32 in MATLAB (The MathWorks), and 
task events and neural responses were recorded (Plexon) using a Datapixx I/O box (Vpixx) 
for precise temporal registration. All of these systems were integrated using the PLDAPS 
system 33.
General procedure and experimental design
Recording sessions in either MT or LIP began by lowering an electrode to the known 
location of the area based on previous mapping and recording sessions. Anatomical 
identification (MR guided in monkey N; previously established in monkey P31) was 
followed by functional identification (mapping receptive/response fields (RF) of MT and 
LIP neurons, detailed below). Inactivations of either area began by lowering both a cannula 
and multichannel electrode array to the region of interest, collaterally, at least 1mm apart. 
The electrode array was used to (i) confirm that the cannula is within the target cortex, (ii) to 
record electrophysiological responses to relevant task events pre-infusion, and (iii) to 
confirm the electrophysiological silencing of neurons during and after the infusion. Thus, 
while it is not feasible to precisely measure the inactivated proportion of an area, we do 
confirm the silencing of a large swath (approximately 2.5mm in radius), on every session 
(detailed in Infusion Protocol, below).
MT inactivation was predicted to disrupt motion direction discrimination sensitivity within a 
specific region of contralateral space, consistent with MT retinotopic organization15,16. The 
behavioural consequence of MT inactivation was measured by comparing psychophysical 
performance in the direction-discrimination task, before and after muscimol infusion, within

 the same experimental session, with the motion stimulus placed inside the inactivated region 
of space. LIP inactivation was predicted to disrupt spatial selection to contralateral space 
more generally8,19-21,34,35, noting that LIP RF are large and that the topographic 
organization is less precise than in earlier visual areas36. The behavioural consequence of 
LIP inactivation was measured by comparing the proportion of contralateral choices in a 
double-target memory-guided “free-choice” task, before and after muscimol infusion, within 
the same session. To measure the impact of LIP inactivation in the direction-discrimination 
task, we compared psychophysical performance between pairs of sessions, baseline and 
treatment, in which the treatment session was a muscimol, saline, or sham infusion 
treatment. The paired sessions typically took place 1 day apart at the same time of day and 
after a similar number of tasks and trials, to minimize the impact of within-session fatigue or 
motivation on behaviour. Behavioural data were collected 15-30 minutes after muscimol/
saline/sham infusion end, and always completed within 150 minutes. An additional 16 
control pairs (without saline or sham manipulation) were collected to better estimate 
session-to-session variability. Statistical results do not depend on the inclusion/exclusion of 
these control session pairs.
Direction discrimination task
The principal task was a motion direction discrimination task. Subjects were required to 
discriminate the net direction of a motion stimulus and communicate their decision with an 
eye movement to one of two targets. The sequence of task events is presented in Fig. 1a. The 
timing of each event was randomly jittered from trial to trial (Fig. 1b). A trial began with the 
appearance of a fixation point. Once the monkey acquired fixation and held for 400-1200ms 
(uniform distribution), two targets appeared and remained visible until the end of the trial. 
200-1000ms after target onset, the motion stimulus was presented at an eccentricity of 5-7° 
for 1050ms. The fixation point was extinguished 200-1000ms after motion offset, and the 
subject was required to shift its gaze towards one of the two targets within 600ms (saccade 
end points within 3° of the target location were accepted).
We used a reverse-correlation motion stimulus inspired by the classic moving dots 
stimulus15 in which motion was in either one direction or the opposite, with varying motion 
strength. The motion stimulus consisted of 19 non-overlapping Gabor elements arranged in a 
hexagonal grid (5-7° across, scaled by eccentricity). The individual elements were set to 
approximate the RF size of a V1 neuron and the entire motion stimulus approximated the RF 
size of an MT neuron. Motion was presented by varying the phase of the sine-wave carrier 
of the Gabors. Each Gabor underwent a sinusoidal contrast modulation with independent 
random phase to prevent perceptual “pop-out” of individual drifting elements. Gabor spatial 
frequency (0.9 cycles/°, sigma = 0.1 × eccentricity) and temporal frequency (7Hz for 
monkey N, 5Hz for money P, yielding velocities of 7.77 and 5.55 °/s, respectively) were 
selected to match the approximate sensitivity of MT neurons.
Each trial comprised seven consecutive motion pulses lasting 150ms each (9 video frames), 
producing a pulse sequence of 1050ms in duration. On any given pulse Xi, a number of 
Gabors would have their carrier sine waves drift in unison to produce motion (“signal” 
Gabors), and the remaining would counter-phase flicker (“noise” Gabors). Signal Gabors on

 pulse Xi were assigned at random within the grid and all signal Gabors drifted in the same 
direction.
Motion strength was defined as the proportion of signal Gabors out of the total, the value of 
which was drawn from a Gaussian distribution, Xi ∼ N(μk, σ) and rounded to the nearest 
integer, where μk was set to one of five values at random: -50%, -12%, 0%, 12%, and 50% 
(negative sign indicates motion in the opposite direction), and σ was set to 15%. Thus, while 
each pulse within a sequence could take on any value (or sign) from distribution N(μk, σ), 
the expectation of a sequence would be μk. Motion strength was then z scored over all 
sessions, for each monkey separately.
On the motion strength axis, we use positive values to indicate motion towards the hemifield 
contralateral to the LIP under study, and negative values to indicate motion towards the 
hemifield ipsilateral to the LIP understudy. We use the term “Proportion choices” to refer to 
the proportion of choices towards the contralateral target. For consistency, we maintain this 
convention throughout the paper, such that even on MT inactivations sessions, psychometric 
performance is evaluated in relation to the LIP under study.
The monkey was rewarded for selecting the target consistent with the sign of the motion 
pulse sequence sum (i.e., the net direction), independent of the distribution μk from which 
they were drawn. On trials that summed to exactly zero, the monkey was rewarded at 
random. 10% of trials consisted of a frozen random seed, generating identical pulse 
sequences. In addition to the direction discrimination task described here, we performed a 
subset of experiments (n=2) using the classical moving dots stimulus15 with motion 
coherence values of 0, 3.2, 6.4, 12.8, 25.6, 51.2% (Extended Data Fig. 6c).
Free choice task
A free choice task was used to measure spatial bias to one target over another and confirm a 
behavioural consequence of LIP inactivation8,21,35. The task was performed before and after 
every LIP inactivation experiment (n=21 during experiments using the standard direction 
discrimination task, n=13 during other experiments, see for example Extended Data Fig. 6c). 
The sequence of events within the free-choice task is illustrated in Fig. 3a and 3b. Trials 
began with the appearance of a central fixation point. At a random time after acquiring 
fixation (500-900ms), two targets were simultaneously flashed for a brief 200ms. Subjects 
were required to maintain fixation until the fixation point disappeared (600 to 3,000ms after 
target flash), and then saccade to either of the remembered locations of the two targets. On 
every trial, target position was determined independently from one another and at random, 
drawn from a 2D Gaussian with a mean of either [-12, 0] (left target) or [12, 0] (right), and a 
standard deviation of 2-4° for x and 3-5° for y position. Means and standard deviations were 
sometimes adjusted online to better position the distributions within the LIP RF (when 
recorded) or LIP inactivated field (when inactivated).
A trial was successfully completed when the monkey's saccade entered a circular window 
(unobservable to the monkey) around either target and held for 300-500ms (window radius 
scaled by 0.35° × eccentricity, minimum: 3°). Successfully completed free-choices were 
rewarded on 70% of trials irrespective of the target chosen for monkey N, and 100% of trials

 for monkey P. Monkey N also performed memory-guided saccades to single targets (30% of 
trials, randomly interleaved) that appeared randomly in space (uniform distribution), and 
were rewarded 100% of the time. The adjustments in subject N's task were performed to 
prevent a spatial bias and encourage exploration. Overall performance and inactivation 
effects were similar between monkeys despite subtle differences in task parameters.
Behavioural analysis
All analyses were performed in Matlab (The Mathworks). Responses in the direction 
discrimination task were analyzed with a maximum likelihood fit of a two parameter logistic 
function37 assuming a Bernoulli distribution of binary choices, in which the probability of a 
contralateral choice is P and ipsilateral choice is 1-P, where P is given by:
where x is the motion strength value (z-scored over all sessions for each monkey separately), 
α is the bias parameter (reflecting the midpoint of the function in units of motion strength), 
and β is the slope (i.e., sensitivity, in units of log-odds per motion strength). Error estimates 
on the parameters were obtained from the diagonal of the inverse Hessian (2nd derivative 
matrix) of the negative log-likelihood. A four-parameter model including sub-perfect 
response rates for the top and bottom asymptotes8 was also considered, but did not confer 
any advantage over the two-parameter model nor change analysis results, and so we focus on 
the simpler 2-parameter fit (Extended Data Table 1). The first 10-30 trials of every session 
were excluded from analysis because motion strength was maximal to “warm up” the 
animal. Median session length for all baseline and treatment sessions was 409 trials. 
Sessions were excluded from analysis if the animal either completed less than 250 trials or 
performed poorly (lapse rate >10%). For inactivation sessions, all sessions were included 
regardless of performance. A single inactivation session in monkey P was aborted due to a 
leak in the infusion system, and was not included in the analysis.
Animal strategy in the direction discrimination task (Fig. 2f and 2g) was measured by 
computing psychophysical weights via logistic regression, where the probability of the 
binary choice Y∈{0,1} on every trial is given by
where X is a matrix of the seven pulse values on each trial, augmented by a column of ones 
to capture the bias term, and w is a vector of the monkey's weights. We computed the 
maximum likelihood estimate of the weight vector w using Matlab's glmfit function.
In the free-choice task, spatial bias was computed as the proportion of choices to the target 
contralateral to the LIP under study. Saccade onset and offset were detected in every task by 
identifying the time at which eye velocity exceeded 30 °/sec (onset) and returned below

 50 °/sec (offset). We only analyzed saccades on trials where the task was completed 
successfully (i.e. no broken fixations and no saccades outside of the target windows). 
Saccades were analyzed for reaction time, amplitude, duration, and error amplitude (i.e. 
distance of saccadic end point from saccadic target). Saccadic reaction times less than 
100ms from the go signal were excluded to ensure that only task relevant saccades are 
analyzed.
Neuronal recordings
Recordings were performed in areas MT and LIP with either single-channel glass coated 
tungsten electrodes (Alpha Omega) or multi-electrode arrays (Plexon U or V Probe). 
Neuronal signals were amplified, bandpass filtered, digitized, and saved (Plexon MAP 
server). Neural waveforms passing a manually-set threshold were isolated for online 
mapping of their receptive fields (both MT and LIP) and directional tuning (MT).
MT RF locations were hand mapped using drifting dot stimuli in a circular aperture. Once 
the retinotopic location was identified, direction preference and selectivity were measured 
using drifting dot stimuli at 100% coherence in 12 directions. LIP RF locations were 
mapped with a memory-guided delayed saccade task38.
In monkey P, offline spike sorting was performed by hand refinement of a standard 
clustering algorithm (Plexon Offline Sorter v3). Single unit isolation quality was established 
using SNR39. In monkey N, spike sorting was performed by fitting a mixture of Gaussians 
model to clipped waveforms in a reduced dimensional space40. In both monkeys, sorting was 
refined by maximum a posteriori estimation of a model, where the multi-electrode voltage 
was the linear superposition of Gaussian white noise and the spike waveforms41,42.
Neuronal Analysis
Peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were computed by aligning spike times to events 
(motion onset or saccade time), binned at 10ms resolution, and smoothed with a Gaussian 
kernel with standard deviation of 25ms. Trial motion strengths were binned into three 
groups: between 0 and 0.25, between 0.25 and 1, and greater than 1. We averaged spike rates 
separately for the three motion strengths for each choice. Note that these motion strengths 
correspond to a narrower range than that used in previous studies11, selected to encourage 
longer integration times. This is evident in the PSTHs (narrow dynamic range) and 
psychometric functions (fewer data points in the asymptotic range of behavior).
Choice Probability
Choice probability (CP) is a metric used to measure the predictive relationship between 
neural responses and choice, independent of stimulus strength. It is defined as the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for a pair of spiking response distributions 
sorted by choice1,43. We quantified CP using trials that had zero expected motion and were 
repeated with identical random seeds (i.e. had no stimulus variation, “frozen noise”). 
Sometimes more than one random seed was repeated in a session, in which case we 
calculated the spiking response distributions for each seed separately, subtracted the mean, 
and then combined them, similar to an analysis known as Grand Choice Probability 1.

 Neurons with >20 “frozen” repeats were included (90/94 MT cells, 96/113 LIP cells), and 
significance testing against the null (i.e. CP=0.5) was performed using a Student's t test. In 
MT, we counted spikes during the motion epoch (1050ms), In LIP, we counted spikes over a 
400ms window counting backwards from the 100ms before the saccade.
Infusion Protocol
Infusions were performed by lowering an infusion cannula into grid locations that had 
previously yielded the largest number of selective cells during the recording phase of the 
study (Extended Data Figure 1). The cannula (31-32 gauge) was lowered alongside a multi-
electrode array, at least 1mm away (Fig. 2a). The two were lowered to target cortical areas 
where functional identification took place (mapping). Infusion was then performed, and 
electrophysiological silencing was confirmed on the recording electrodes, typically within 
15 minutes of infusion start.
Infusions were performed with a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) through a single and 
direct line to the cannula (constant rate of 0.1-0.4μl/min, 15-30 minutes), in agreement with 
infusion parameters proposed by Noudoost and Moore44. We delivered 6.66-8μg/μl 
muscimol (in phosphate buffered saline) at volumes of 5-12 μl (mean 7.4μl), netting a total 
mass of 40-80μg (mean 56.4μg). This protocol was chosen to match the very high end of 
ranges used previously in order to maximize the probability of neural inactivation. Infusions 
were typically made at multiple depths within a single cannula track. On 5 of the 21 main 
LIP inactivation sessions, more than one cannula was lowered (Extended Data Table 2). 
Cannluae were left in situ for at least 15 minutes after infusion end. Saline infusions 
followed the same protocol and included both a cannula and multi-electrode array. Sham 
infusions included only a multi-electrode array but followed similar timings, including the 
operation of the syringe pump with no syringe attached.
Spatial and temporal extent of Inactivation
Previous analyses of the spatial extent of muscimol inactivation have estimated the 
functional silencing to cover a spherical radius of roughly 2-3mm34,45-47. The study most 
comparable to ours, Liu et al.34, co-infused muscimol and Manganese (Mn) into LIP of 
awake macaques and imaged the spread. They also estimated a cortical silencing of 
approximately 2-3mm in radius, in line with the linear dependence of volume distribution 
(mm3) on infusion volume (μl)48.
In our experiments, lowering both a multi-electrode array and infusion cannula collaterally 
(Fig. 2b) enables direct confirmation of neural silencing at known distances from the 
cannula tip. This places a lower bound on the spatial extent of functional inactivation. 
Although our standard protocol placed the multi-electrode array 1mm away from the 
cannula tip, we sometimes lowered a second array, 2 or 3mm away. On these sessions too, 
we observed silencing on most recording channels. Taken together, we conservatively 
estimate neural inactivation in LIP to span a radius of at least 2.5mm, silencing large swaths 
of LIP while primarily targeting its ventral portion34,49. For inactivations of this spatial 
magnitude there is no evidence that larger inactivations result in larger behavioural

 deficits20. Similarly, we did not observe a dose-response function in our own data (Extended 
Data Figure 3c-e).
On a few occasions, residual firing persisted despite near-complete silencing of 
electrophysiological activity (example shown in Fig. 2b, voltage traces, channels 5 and 6). 
We tested the selectivity of residual firing with the appropriate mapping task (motion for 
MT, memory guided saccades for LIP) and found that these spikes did not respond 
selectively, indicating that these residual spikes likely emanate from afferent fibers 
terminating within the inactivated area50.
Previous LIP inactivation studies found no evidence to support within-session compensation 
that manifests behaviourally19,20,34,47,51, but see Wilke et al.21 In fact, studies that report the 
temporal effect of LIP inactivation find an increase in the impact over time, not a 
decrease19,51. Regardless, we explored the time course of psychophysical performance 
within a session (Extended Data Fig. 4), and also measured for compensation on longer time 
scales, across sessions, to explore the possibility of increasing behavioural robustness to 
inactivation that might develop over time (Extended Data Fig. 5).

 Location of LIP recording and muscimol infusion sites The recording (blue circles) and

and posterior-anterior (P/A) axes within the chamber (demarcated by the ovals). Electrode 
and cannula tracks are represented by the gray lines (with a small jitter on the x-y plane for 
better visualization). The mean infusion depths were 7.12 ± 1.15 (monkey N) and 7.03 
± 1.39 (monkey P) (microdrive was zeroed below dura mater and just above the cortical 
surface). Given the estimated spread of muscimol described in the main text, the 
inactivations targeted a substantial territory of the ventral portion of LIP 49. Even though a 
functional distinction with depth has been proposed 34, we emphasize that the critical 
component of our protocol was targeting the precise locations at which we measured 
canonical decision-related activity in LIP.

Extended Data Figure 4. Time course of accuracy and bias within sessions
Accuracy and bias in the direction discrimination task were computed over time by taking a 
running mean of correct and contralateral choices, respectively (sliding window of 40 trials). 
a, Inactivation in area MT (n=6, green curve; monkey N, 3; monkey P, 3) had a clear and 
consistent impact on behavioural accuracy compared to baseline (n=6, gray), but did not 
have systematic effects on bias (bottom), consistent with our results from the fitted 
psychometric functions (main text). Panels show data from trial 40 (sliding window size) to 
the median trial length of each group of experiments (variable session lengths contribute to 
increased variability at later trials). Error bars show ±1 SEM over experiments. b, 
Inactivations in area LIP (n=21, blue curve; monkey N, 12; monkey P, 9) yielded no 
systematic trends in either accuracy (top) or bias (bottom) compared to baseline (n=21, 
gray), indicating that within-session compensation is unlikely. Panel format same as in a. We 
also investigated whether compensation may have taken place before we began collecting 
the “inactivation” dataset, or perhaps during the first 10-30 low difficulty “warm-up” trials. 
On 13 of the 21 LIP inactivation sessions we collected a 3rd dataset (in addition to the 
standard paired baseline and inactivation datasets), in which psychophysical performance 
was monitored during the time muscimol was being infused (“during infusion”, orange 
curve). No systematic changes in accuracy or bias were observed in this exploratory dataset

 either, further arguing against compensation on the time scales of our manipulations and

sessions
Panels show data from monkey P (left) and monkey N (right), for all baseline and treatment 
pairs: muscimol (blue, n=21), saline (unfilled gray, n=6) and sham (filled gray, n=3). Each 
pair consists of two sessions that took place in close succession (typically on consecutive 
days), at a similar time of day, after a similar number of preceding tasks and trials, and is 
represented by two markers connected by a line. (Additional control pairs with no saline/
sham manipulation (n=16) are not presented, for visual clarity). a, Psychometric function 
slope over sessions. No significant change in slope was present over time, evaluated by 
linear regression, for either monkey P (p = 0.22) or N (p = 0.63). When considering the 
difference in slope between baseline and treatment pairs, monkey P exhibited a small 
decrease (regression line slope = -0.07, p = 0.023), indicating that inactivations may have 
affected monkey sensitivity gradually over time. However, a similar effect was seen in the 
interleaved controls (saline and sham, gray markers), indicating that this effect likely reflects 
nonspecific trends in performance across back-to-back pairs of experiments. Monkey N had 
no significant change (p = 0.92). b, Psychometric function midpoint over sessions. No 
significant change was observed in the session-to-session midpoint values, evaluated by 
linear regression, for either monkey P (p = 0.44) or monkey N (p = 0.24). When considering 
the difference in midpoint value for each dataset pair over time (i.e. muscimol treatment – 
baseline), no significant change was detected either (p = 0.98 and p = 0.4 for monkey P and 
N, respectively). X-axis dates are in yyyymmdd format.

 Figure 1. Task and neural responses during direction discrimination
a, Monkeys were trained to discriminate the direction of visual motion and communicate 
their decision with a saccadic eye movement to one of two choice targets. For MT 
recordings, motion was placed in the MT receptive field (RF) (green patch). For LIP 
recordings, one of the saccade targets was placed in the LIP RF (blue patch). b, Sequence of 
task events. Gray arrows indicate temporal jitter. c, Average response of 94 MT neurons as a 
function of motion strength (grouped by z-scored net motion, see Methods) and direction (in 
versus opposite of cell's preferred direction, solid and dashed lines, respectively), aligned to 
motion onset. d, Average response of 113 LIP neurons as a function of motion strength and 
direction (in and out of cell's RF, solid and dashed lines, respectively), aligned to motion 
onset. e, Choice probability for 90 MT neurons computed during the motion epoch. Triangle 
indicates mean, 0.54. f, Choice probability for 96 LIP neurons computed during the motion 
epoch. Triangle indicates mean, 0.70. Only neurons with >20 repeats of identical stimuli 
were included in the choice probability analysis.

 Figure 2. Psychophysical performance before and after neural inactivations in areas MT and LIP
a, Hypothesized consequences of inactivation on the psychometric function. Left, decreased 
psychophysical sensitivity would correspond to a decrease in slope. Right, changes in 
psychophysical bias would correspond to a shifted midpoint. Positive values in the x-axis (z-
scored motion strength) refer to motion towards the target contralateral to the LIP under 
study. Correspondingly, the y-axis refers to the proportion of contralateral target choices. 
This convention is maintained throughout. b, Schematic of the inactivation protocol. Left, A 
multi-electrode array was lowered alongside the cannula to identify the targeted cortical 
location, to verify neural selectivity prior to infusion, and to confirm neural silencing after. 
Right, continuous voltage traces from an example inactivation session in which neural 
silencing is evident ∼10 minutes after infusion start. c, d, Psychophysical data for averaged 
pairs of baseline and muscimol treatment sessions in MT (c), and LIP (d). Insets illustrate 
the brain region inactivated (top) and the corresponding experimental geometry (bottom), 
along with the estimated inactivated field (gray cloud). Error bars on points show ±1 SEM 
across all sessions. e, The distribution of psychometric function parameters, slope (top) and 
shift (bottom), reflecting sensitivity and bias, respectively, for baseline (x-axis) and 
treatment (y-axis) session pairs for MT inactivations (green symbols), LIP inactivations 
(blue symbols), as well as LIP saline (open gray symbols) and sham/control experiments 
(filled gray symbols), for monkey N (diamonds) and monkey P (squares). Error bars show 
95% confidence intervals for individual sessions. f, g, Psychophysical weighting, estimated 
via reverse correlation. Y-axis indicates how much the subject weighed each of the motion

 Figure 3. Performance in control tasks following LIP inactivation
a, The “free-choice” task. Following a 200ms long presentation of two targets at random 
locations in space, monkeys were required to hold fixation for another 600-3,000ms, and 
then to move their eyes to the remembered location of either target. b, Task timing. Events in 
the task were presented in sequence and were jittered in time (gray arrows). c, The effect of 
LIP inactivation on choice bias and saccade accuracy in the free-choice task (example 
session): saccade landing points (black dots) have been aligned to target position (red dot), 
for contralateral (left) and ipsilateral target choices (right), during baseline (top) and 
inactivation (bottom). Both saccadic accuracy and percent contralateral choices (noted in 
text, top left) are reduced after LIP inactivation, to the contralateral hemifield. d, The effect 
of LIP inactivation on choice bias and saccade accuracy in the free-choice task, over all 
sessions. Histograms show baseline/inactivation differences in proportion contralateral 
choices (top) and saccade error (bottom), where positive numbers indicate an increase in 
metric following inactivation. Dark bars indicate sessions that took place on the same days 
as the main direction discrimination experiment (“Main experiment inactivations”, n=21; 
monkey N, 12; monkey P, 9); dark triangle indicates the median difference. Light bars 
include an additional 13 sessions that took place during other inactivation experiments under 
similar conditions (“All inactivations”, n=34; monkey N, 14; monkey P, 20); light triangle 
indicates median difference (visually occluded by dark triangle). e, Psychophysical data for 
pairs of baseline and muscimol treatment in LIP when both choice targets were placed 
within the inactivated field. Inset presents stimulus geometry and estimated inactivated field.
