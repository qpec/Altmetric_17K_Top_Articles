Abstract
Background and objectives The relationship between mineral and bone disorders and survival according to
residualkidneyfunctionstatushasnotbeenpreviouslystudiedinpatientsonhemodialysis.Wehypothesizedthat
residual kidney function, defined by renal urea clearance, modifies the association between mineral and bone
disorder parameters and mortality.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements The associations of serum phosphorus, albumin-corrected calcium,
intact parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase with all-cause mortality were examined across three strata
(,1.5, 1.5 to ,3.0, and $3.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2) of baseline residual renal urea clearance using Cox models
adjusted for clinical characteristics and laboratory measurements in 35,114 incident hemodialysis patients
from a large United States dialysis organization over the period of 2007–2011.
Results A total of 8102 (23%) patients died during the median follow-up of 1.3 years (interquartile range, 0.6–2.3
years). There was an incremental mortality risk across higher serum phosphorus concentrations, which was
pronounced among patients with higher residual renal urea clearance (Pinteraction=0.001). Lower concentrations of
serum intact parathyroid hormone were associated with higher mortality among patients with low residual renal
urea clearance (i.e., ,1.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2), whereas higher concentrations showed a higher mortality risk
amongpatientswithgreaterresidualrenal urea clearance (i.e.,$1.5ml/minper 1.73 m2;Pinteraction,0.001).Higher
serum corrected total calcium and higher alkaline phosphatase concentrations consistently showed higher
mortality risk (Ptrend,0.001 for both) irrespective of residual renal urea clearance strata (Pinteraction=0.34 and
Pinteraction=0.53, respectively).
Conclusions Residual kidney function modified the mortality risk associated with serum phosphorus and intact
parathyroid hormone among incident hemodialysis patients. Future studies are needed to examine whether
taking account for residual kidney function into the assessment of mortality risk associated with serum
phosphorus and intact parathyroid hormone improves patient management and clinical outcomes in the
hemodialysis population.

Introduction
Mineral and bone disorder (MBD), characterized by
abnormal serum concentrations of calcium, phospho-
rus, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), are a common complication in
patients with CKD, especially in those with ESRD (1).
The above MBD abnormalities may lead to high
mortality risk due to adverse cardiovascular or in-
fection-related pathways (2–5). However, those ab-
normalities may be attenuated in patients on
hemodialysis with substantial residual kidney func-
tion (RKF) who maintain greater solute clearance (6).
Preserved RKF also offers other clinical benefits,
including lower ultrafiltration volume, less intradia-
lytic hypotension, and lower prevalence of anemia as
well as decreased progression rate of malnutrition,
inflammation, erythropoietin resistance, and ventric-
ular hypertrophy (6–8). Therefore, the associations of
such clinical parameters with mortality and the effect
of interventions on patient survival may differ de-
pending on RKF levels among patients on hemodial-
ysis. Indeed, several studies have suggested that
frequent hemodialysis is beneficial to those with little
or no RKF but may be detrimental to those with
substantial RKF (9–11).
However, few studies have taken RKF levels into
account when evaluating associations between MBD
markers and mortality in patients on hemodialysis,
although up to 45% of patients in the United States
initiate maintenance dialysis at eGFRs.10 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 (12,13). Hence, we hypothesized that RKF
levels modify the associations of serum phosphorus,

 calcium, intact PTH, and ALP with all-cause mortality in
patients on hemodialysis.
Materials and Methods
Patients
We retrospectively extracted, refined, and examined data
from all incident hemodialysis patients who initiated
treatment between 2007 and 2011 and were treated for
$60 consecutive days in facilities operated by a large
dialysis organization in the United States. Patients were
followed up from their first dialysis date to December 31,
2011. Of the 133,162 incident ESRD patients who were
treated with in-center thrice-weekly hemodialysis as their
initial dialysis modality, we excluded 21,125 patients who
were ever treated with other modalities; 3012 who had
missing data on MBD parameters, such as serum phos-
phorus, calcium, intact PTH, or ALP, at baseline (i.e., the
first quarter or 91 days of dialysis); and 73,911 who had
missing data on baseline residual renal urea clearance
(rCLurea) (Supplemental Figures 1). Our final study pop-
ulation consisted of 35,114 incident hemodialysis patients.
This study was approved by the University of California
Irvine Medical Center and the University of Washington
with the exemption of obtaining written consent given the
large sample size, anonymity of the patients studied, and
nonintrusive nature of the research.
Demographic, Clinical, and Laboratory Measures
Information on all-cause death, race/ethnicity, primary
insurance, vascular access type, comorbidities, and labo-
ratory variables were obtained from the electronic database
of the dialysis provider.
Blood samples were drawn using uniform techniques in
all dialysis clinics and transported to the central laboratory
in Deland, Florida, typically within 24 hours. All laboratory
values were measured by automated and standardized
methods. Most laboratory values were measured monthly,
including serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, cal-
cium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate. Serum ferritin and
intact PTH were measured at least quarterly. Hemoglobin
was measured at least monthly in all patients and weekly to
biweekly in most patients. Most blood samples were
collected predialysis, with the exception of the postdialysis
urea that was obtained to calculate urea kinetics.
We used rCLurea as the index of RKF in all analyses. The
average serum urea concentrations during collection were
assumed to be 90% of the predialysis concentrations
according to the approach by Daugirdas et al. (14), and
thus, rCLurea was calculated as follows:
rCLureaðml=minÞ ¼
urinary urea nitrogen ðmg=dlÞ 3 urinary volume ðmlÞ
collected time ðminÞ 3 ½0:9 3 predialysis serum urea nitrogen ðmg=dlÞ� ;
where serum urea nitrogen was obtained on the closest day
within 628 days of urine collection. Urine collected time
was reported as 1440 minutes in 98% of measurements,
ranging from 720 to 2880 minutes. We then adjusted rCLurea
for body surface area and expressed it as milliliter per
minute per 1.73 m2 (15,16). Normalized protein catabolic
rate (nPCR) was calculated accounting for rCLurea (17,18).
To minimize measurement variability, averaged values
of laboratory variables, including rCLurea, during the first
patient-quarter (or the first 91 days of dialysis) within each
patient served as baseline data and were used in all models.
Statistical Analyses
Differences in baseline characteristics between included
versus excluded patients were compared by standardized
differences (19,20). Patients were categorized into three
groups according to baseline rCLurea strata (,1.5, 1.5 to
,3.0, and $3.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and associations of
patient characteristics with rCLurea categories were evalu-
ated by nonparametric trend tests. The cutoff value of 3.0
ml/min per 1.73 m2 was selected on the basis of the
definition of substantial RKF in the previous studies and
guidelines (11,21,22). To evaluate trends across rCLurea
levels, we also used an additional cutoff point at 1.5 ml/min
per 1.73 m2, so that all groups maintained reasonable sample
sizes, even after being stratified by each MBD parameter.
MBD parameters were treated as categorical variables, and
their association with all-cause mortality was examined by
Cox proportional hazard models.
For each analysis, we used hierarchical adjustment
with three models as follows: (1) unadjusted models that
included the a priori–defined categories of each one of
the exposures (i.e., phosphorus, uncorrected or albumin-
corrected calcium, intact PTH, or ALP); (2) case mix–adjusted
models that included the above variables plus age, sex,
race/ethnicity, primary insurance, central venous catheter
use, hypertension, diabetes, history of cardiovascular
disease (i.e., congestive heart failure, atherosclerotic heart
disease, cerebrovascular disease, or other cardiovascular
disease), rCLurea, and single-pool Kt/V; and (3) case mix–
plus malnutrition-inflammation cachexia syndrome
(MICS)–adjusted models that included all covariates in
the case mix model plus body mass index, nPCR, hemo-
globin, serum albumin, creatinine, ferritin, and the use of
medications, including vitamin D receptor activators (i.e.,
calcitriol, paricalcitol, or doxercalciferol either oral or
intravenous), calcium-containing phosphorus binders,
and noncalcium-containing phosphorus binders (i.e.,
sevelamar and lanthanum), as well as MBD parameters
other than the exposure of interest (i.e., phosphorus,
uncorrected calcium, and natural log–transformed intact
PTH and ALP).
We defined the fully adjusted model (i.e., case mix– plus
MICS–adjusted models) as the primary model. Hazard
proportionality was confirmed by Schoenfeld residuals.
Associations of MBD markers with mortality were also
evaluated across strata of rCLurea. Effect modification of the
association between each MBD parameter and mortality by
rCLurea was evaluated by creation of interaction terms and
use of the Wald test. We also categorized patients into a
total of 12 or 15 groups according to combined baseline
levels of rCLurea and each MBD parameter and examined
their associations with mortality. Consistent results were
observed in sensitivity analyses using restricted cubic
spline functions with four knots (Supplemental Figures
2–6) or excluding patients with rCLurea.15 ml/min per
1.73 m2 (data not shown).
The frequency of missing data was low (,1% for most
laboratory tests, except for nPCR [6%] and creatinine [4%]),
and multiple imputation methods with five datasets were
used in all regression analyses. Analyses were conducted

 using STATA MP, version 13.1 (StataCorp, College Sta-

Results
Baseline Characteristics
The cohort included 35,114 incident hemodialysis pa-
tients, in whom the mean6SD age was 62615 years old;
there were 63% men, 55% non-Hispanic white, and 27%
non-Hispanic black, and 59% of patients had diabetes.
Mean or median serum baseline phosphorus, albumin-
corrected calcium, intact PTH, and ALP levels were 5.061.1
mg/dl, 9.160.5 mg/dl, 312 (interquartile range [IQR], 201–
477) pg/dl, and 84 (IQR, 67–110) U/L, respectively. The
prevalence rates of patients with low (,1.5 ml/min per
1.73 m2), middle (1.5 to ,3.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and high
($3.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2) rCLurea levels were 20%, 28%,
and 52%, respectively. Median urine volume was 300 (IQR,
200–450), 600 (IQR, 500–900), and 1200 (IQR–850, 1675)
ml/d in the low, middle, and high rCLurea groups, re-
spectively. Patients with greater rCLurea tended to have
higher albumin and uncorrected calcium levels and had
lower creatinine, phosphorus, intact PTH, and ALP levels
(Table 1). A total of 8102 (23%) patients died during the
median follow-up of 1.3 years (IQR, 0.6–2.3 years), with an
incidence of 15.0 deaths per 100 patient-years. The leading
cause of death was cardiovascular disease (40%) followed
by withdrawal from dialysis/uremia (10%), infection (7%),
and malignancy (4%).
Compared with 76,923 excluded patients who lacked
data on baseline rCLurea, phosphorus, albumin-corrected
calcium, intact PTH, or ALP, the 35,114 included patients
were more likely to be men, non-Hispanic white, and
vitamin D receptor activator users; had higher levels of
body mass index, Kt/V, hemoglobin, and albumin; and
had lower levels of ALP and ferritin (standardized differ-
ence .0.1) (Supplemental Table 1). Associations of these
MBD parameters with all-cause mortality were found to be
similar between included versus excluded patients in the
fully adjusted models without adjustment for rCLurea and
nPCR, the missingness of which was the most common
reason for exclusion (.95%) (Supplemental Figure 7).
Association of Phosphorus and All-Cause Mortality
according to rCLurea Strata
In the unadjusted model, higher serum phosphorus was
associated with better survival. This association was
attenuated in the case mix model and even reversed in
the MICS model (fully adjusted model) across all rCLurea
strata (Figure 1, A–C). Fully-adjusted mortality risk asso-
ciated with serum phosphorus was significantly modified
by rCLurea (Pinteraction=0.001), in which the association of
higher serum phosphorous with mortality was more
pronounced across higher levels of rCLurea: adjusted
hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs) of the highest phosphorous group ($7.0 mg/dl)
versus the second lowest group (4.0 to ,5.0 mg/dl) were
1.31 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.64), 1.77 (95% CI, 1.45 to 2.17), and
1.93 (95% CI, 1.59 to 2.33) among patients in the low,
middle, and high rCLurea strata, respectively (Figure 1, A–
C). When categorizing patients into 15 groups according to
combined baseline levels of serum phosphorus and rCLurea
(reference: serum phosphorous =4.0–5.0 mg/dl and
rCLurea$3.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2), a trend toward lower
mortality risk was observed across higher rCLurea within
given serum phosphorus categories ,6.0 mg/dl
(Ptrend,0.001) but was not observed within the higher
categories (Figure 1D).
Association of Calcium and All-Cause Mortality according to
rCLurea Strata
The overall mortality risk associated with higher
albumin-corrected calcium was higher in all models
(Ptrend#0.002 for all models). Compared with the middle
corrected calcium group (i.e., 8.8 to ,9.2 mg/dl), aHR was
1.08 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.16) in the highest group (i.e., $9.6
mg/dl) overall (Supplemental Figure 7B). The association
between corrected calcium and mortality was not signif-
icantly modified by rCLurea in the fully adjusted model
(Pinteraction=0.34), and the trend in the adjusted association
between corrected calcium and mortality seemed consis-
tent across rCLurea strata (Figure 2, A–C). Higher rCLurea
was consistently associated with lower mortality risk
across serum calcium categories in models evaluating 15
groups of combined rCLurea and corrected calcium levels
(reference: corrected calcium =8.8 to ,9.2 mg/dl and
rCLurea$3.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2; Ptrend,0.001 for all)
(Figure 2D). Consistent patterns were observed in the
association between uncorrected calcium and mortality
(Supplemental Figure 8).
Association of PTH and All-Cause Mortality according to
rCLurea Strata
Higher serum intact PTH levels were associated with
lower risk of mortality in the unadjusted models across all
three rCLurea groups. In the fully adjusted model, this
association was attenuated but still significant in the lowest
rCLurea group (P=0.004), but it reversed in the middle and
highest rCLurea groups (P=0.05 and P,0.01, respectively;
Pinteraction,0.001) (Figure 3, A–C). Compared with the
second lowest PTH group (150 to ,300 pg/ml), the
aHRs of the lowest group (,150 pg/ml) were 1.05 (95%
CI, 0.92 to 1.19), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83 to 1.07), and 0.99 (95%
CI, 0.90 to 1.09) among patients in the low, middle, and
high rCLurea groups, respectively, whereas the aHRs of the
highest intact PTH group ($600 pg/ml) versus the refer-
ence were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.09), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.96 to
1.29), and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.26) among patients in the
low, middle, and high rCLurea groups, respectively. Models
using spline functions yielded consistent results (Supple-
mental Figure 5). When categorizing patients into 12
groups according to baseline levels of intact PTH and
rCLurea, the mortality risk in the high rCLurea group versus
the low rCLurea group was attenuated to some extent in
higher intact PTH levels but consistently lower across PTH
categories (reference: intact PTH =150 to ,300 pg/ml and
rCLurea$3.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2) (Figure 3D).
Association of ALP and All-Cause Mortality according to
rCLurea Strata
Higher ALP was associated with higher mortality irre-
spective of adjustment models overall. Compared with the
middle ALP group (i.e., 60 to ,80 IU/L), the highest group
(i.e., $120 IU/L) was associated with higher mortality risk
with aHR of 1.36 (95% CI, 1.28 to 1.45) (Supplemental
1120
Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology
 Figure 7D). The association between ALP and mortality
was not significantly modified by rCLurea in the fully
adjusted models (Pinteraction=0.53). Trends in the adjusted
association between ALP and mortality were consistent
across rCLurea strata (Figure 4, A–C), which was also
supported in models using restricted cubic splines
(Supplemental Figure 6). When categorizing patients into
15 groups according to baseline levels of ALP and rCLurea,
higher rCLurea was consistently associated with lower
mortality risk across serum ALP categories (reference:
ALP=60 to ,80 U/L and rCLurea$3.0 ml/min per
1.73 m2; Ptrend,0.001) (Figure 4D).

 Discussion
This study examined the modification of the association
of several MBD parameters with mortality by RKF among
incident hemodialysis patients and found several novel
observations. RKF levels modified the association of
phosphorus and intact PTH with all-cause death. The
relative mortality risk associated with high serum phos-
phorus concentrations was stronger in patients with higher
rCLurea levels. As for serum intact PTH, lower concentra-
tions showed a higher mortality risk among patients with
low rCLurea, whereas higher concentrations were associ-
ated with higher mortality among patients with high
rCLurea levels. In contrast, higher concentrations of calcium
and ALP were associated with all-cause death irrespective
of rCLurea levels. Of note, higher rCLurea was associated
with better survival across MBD marker categories, with
the exception that patients with serum phosphorus $7.0
mg/dl showed comparable mortality risk irrespective of
rCLurea levels.
Mortality risk associated with high serum phosphorus
concentrations was pronounced in the high rCLurea group
versus the low rCLurea group. Serum phosphorus was
lower among patients on hemodialysis with higher rCLurea
levels, which is consistent with the observation that RKF,
even at such low levels, contributes to substantial clearance
of phosphorus in patients with ESRD (23). High serum
phosphorus levels among patients with high RKF may
indicate nonadherence to diet, hemodialysis prescription,
and/or medications, including phosphorus binders and
cinacalcet, as well as high-turnover bone disease. High
dietary phosphorus loading has been shown to induce
inflammation, malnutrition, vascular calcification, and

 premature death in rodent CKD models (24,25), and
nonuse of phosphorus binders has also been linked to
higher mortality (26).
Previous studies have shown a U-shaped or linear
association between serum calcium and mortality in pa-
tients on hemodialysis depending on the calcium catego-
rizations, assays used, variables accounted for, statistical
models, and the underlying study population (12,27–31).
Our results also confirmed that higher serum calcium levels
were associated with higher mortality risk in the overall
analysis, which could be explained by several mechanisms,
including vascular calcification, hypertension, and infec-
tion (32). Meanwhile, in contrast to the interaction between
serum phosphorus and rCLurea, the association of serum
calcium with all-cause mortality was not significantly
modified by rCLurea. This finding may be explained by
the fact that calcium is less likely to be affected by RKF than
phosphorus. Recent calcium balance studies have consis-
tently shown that calcium loads resulted in little or no
increase in urinary calcium excretion, even in patients with
CKD stages 3 and 4 (33,34). Calcium may be excreted into
the urine at even lower levels in patients with ESRD and
low RKF, and indeed, we did not observe significant
differences in albumin-corrected calcium across rCLurea
strata.
There have been mixed data on the PTH-mortality
association in patients on hemodialysis (1), and these
inconsistent findings may be explained by unmeasured
or residual confounding by their RKF. Several-fold higher
concentrations of intact PTH are required to maintain
normal bone turnover among patients with ESRD (35),
known as skeletal resistance to PTH (36). This phenomena

 is partly due to the diminished PTH receptor expression of
osteoblast in the uremic milieu (37,38). Also, accumulated
bioinactive 7–84 PTH fragment in patients with ESRD
interferes with the second generation intact PTH assay,
resulting in falsely higher values of PTH (39). However,
these abnormalities in the uremic milieu are likely to be less
severe among patients with substantial RKF compared
with those with little or no RKF (6,40–42). Our study
showed for the first time that higher intact PTH levels were
associated with lower mortality among patients on hemo-
dialysis with low RKF, whereas higher intact PTH levels
showed a higher mortality risk among patients with
substantial RKF. Additionally, the effect of impaired
capacity of the bone to buffer mineral loads due to low
bone turnover may be accentuated among patients with
little or no RKF, resulting in accelerated cardiovascular
calcification (43,44). In contrast, we observed a consistent
association between higher ALP and higher mortality
across rCLurea levels. Although PTH affects bone metab-
olism, ALP is excreted from the bone and arteries with
calcification (45), and hence, it is a useful marker of bone
metabolism and active osteochondrogenesis (46–48).
Our results can be interpreted from the other viewpoint
of the effect modification of the association between RKF
levels and mortality by MBD parameters. The association
of higher RKF with better survival was attenuated among
patients with higher levels of phosphorus and intact PTH.
Nevertheless, patients with greater RKF consistently showed
better survival even after rigorous adjustment, supporting
the recently highlighted importance of RKF in the hemo-
dialysis population (6,20).
Strengths of our study include its large sample size of
patients on hemodialysis with RKF data and use of uniform
laboratory measurements. However, several limitations

 should be noted. First, as with other observational studies,
our study cannot prove causality. There may also be
residual confounding or unmeasured confounders on the
basis of vitamin D deficiency, inflammatory status, ele-
vated fibroblast growth factor–23, treatment adherence,
and inadequate predialysis care (49–54). Second, RKF may
not be accurate given the use of rCLurea, the difficulties in
punctual and complete collection of urine samples, and the
use of factor 0.9 for estimating average predialysis serum
urea. Nevertheless, the population-level associations can be
estimated from an adequate number of patients if such
errors are not associated with the outcome, and a recent
study has shown that change in rCLurea used in this study
was closely related to all-cause mortality (20). Third, the
reason for urine being collected (or not collected) was not
available in this administrative database, and potential
selection bias may exist, because patients with limited RKF
are less likely to have undergone urine collections.
However, similar patterns of association between all
MBD markers and mortality were observed between in-
cluded and excluded patients, suggesting the indepen-
dence of the eligibility criteria of this study from those
associations. Fourth, we included exclusively incident
hemodialysis patients, and it is unclear whether our
findings can be extrapolated to prevalent hemodialysis
patients. Fifth, cause-specific death was not examined
given a limited number of each event, even with, so far,
the largest number of patients on hemodialysis with data
on rCLurea.
In conclusion, our study showed that RKF modified the
association of serum phosphorus and intact PTH with all-
cause mortality among incident hemodialysis patients,
whereas serum calcium and ALP showed consistent asso-
ciations with mortality irrespective of RKF. Future studies
with a long-term follow-up period are needed to explain
the underlying mechanisms of those associations and
