Abstract
The question of cognitive complexity in early Homo sapiens in North Africa is intimately tied
to the emergence of the Aterian culture (~145 ka). One of the diagnostic indicators of cogni-
tive complexity is the presence of specialised bone tools, however significant uncertainty
remains over the manufacture and use of these artefacts within the Aterian techno-complex.
In this paper we report on a bone artefact from Aterian Middle Stone Age (MSA) deposits in
Dar es-Soltan 1 cave on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. It comes from a layer that can be
securely dated to ~90 ka. The typological characteristics of this tool, which suggest its man-
ufacture and use as a bone knife, are comparatively similar to other bone artefacts from
dated Aterian levels at the nearby site of El Mnasra and significantly different from any other
African MSA bone technology. The new find from Dar es-Soltan 1 cave combined with those
from El Mnasra suggest the development of a bone technology unique to the Aterian.
Introduction
North Africa yields one of the richest hominin fossil records of early Homo sapiens [1–3], asso-
ciated with a Middle Stone Age (MSA) culture that displays some of the same characteristics as
contemporaneous sub-Saharan assemblages, where early cognitive complexity is recognised
[4]. These include the systematic processing and use of pigments and the production of shell
bead ornaments that are argued to represent symbolically mediated behaviour. In particular,
perforated marine shell beads at Blombos Cave and Sibudu in South Africa [5, 6], are

 remarkably similar to those recovered from sites in Morocco (El Mnasra, Contrebandiers,
Taforalt, Rhafas, Bizmoune, Ifri n’Ammar [7, 8]) dated to around 82 ka or earlier [9, 10], and
from Oued Djebbana in Algeria [11, 12]. Despite the presence of these objects, other diagnostic
indicators of behavioural complexity, such as specialised bone tools, are only sparsely reported
in the North African MSA (but see [13]). The existence of bone tools in association with the
Aterian culture was reported over 60 years ago from the sites of El Mnasra and Dar es-Soltan 1
in Morocco [14]. The significance of these and other specimens has been re-evaluated in recent
publications [15–18] but they have not yet been subject to a detailed study.
Here we describe a specialized bone tool discovered in association with the Aterian techno-
complex from the cave site of Dar es-Soltan 1 (Morocco). The find occurs in a long cultural
sequence dated by a suite of OSL age determinations providing an age of 90 ka for the bone
tool bearing layer. The typological characteristics of this tool suggest a complex chaîne opéra-
toire during its manufacture and its possible use as a knife. The features of this tool are similar
to at least two other flat-bone artefacts from El Mnasra [14]. Together, these osseous artefacts
suggest that the Aterians developed an independent North African cultural adaptation of osse-
ous implements differing from projectile points used elsewhere in Africa during the MSA.
Materials and methods
The bone artefact described in this paper (specimen inventory number DES1-12 N502-659) is
currently housed at the Laboratory of the National Institute of Archaeological Science and
Heritage, Rabat (Morocco). The permit to conduct archaeological excavations at Dar es- Soltan
1 cave was granted by the Moroccan Ministry of Culture (Authorisation numbers 676 and 677,
March 14th 2012). The bone specimen is publicly deposited at the National Institute of
Archaeological Science and Heritage, Rabat (Morocco) and accessible to the scientific team
members and to any authorizied researcher.
Archaeological and stratigraphical context
Dar es-Soltan 1 cave (33˚58’44”N, 6˚53’51”W) lies about 10 km south-west of Rabat and 260 m
inland from the present Atlantic coast (Fig 1). The cave entrance faces west towards the ocean
and is at an altitude of 13.52 m. The cave measures about 21 m in depth and is about 10 m at
its widest point. Previous excavations by Dr. Armand Ruhlmann in 1937 and 1938 confirmed
the presence of Aterian (MSA) and Iberomaurusian/Late Stone Age (LSA) layers that are rich
in artefactual and organic remains. Human skeletal remains were also reported from the
uppermost layers [1].
The new research program at Dar es-Soltan 1 cave was coordinate by the Moroccan Institut
National des Sciences de l’Arche
´ologie et du Patrimoine and the University of Oxford (UK),
with permission from the Ministry of Culture (Kingdom of Morocco). We undertook new
excavations in the cave in 2005 [19], in 2008, to collect samples for tephra analysis and to exca-
vate a Neolithic burial in G5 and, finally, in 2012, when we excavated additional areas along-
side previous excavation trenches (Fig 1B). The bone tool was found during this last season of
excavation. A composite sedimentary log was recorded in various vertical segments spaced,
according to clarity of exposure, along longitudinal sections left by Ruhlmann. The overall
sequence has been divided into five ‘Groups’, considered to be equivalent to the grade of a geo-
logical ‘member’ and valid for all parts of the cave (Fig 1 and S1 Fig) [19].
The bone artefact described in this paper was found in unit G3.v in square N502 (Fig 1B–
1D). Most of Group 3 in other parts of the cave (as reported in [2]) is almost wholly phosphatic
(no HCl-reaction) and very strongly bioturbated at various scales; this has resulted in an
extremely ‘fuzzy’ stratigraphy without faunal remains, that is contextually unsatisfactory,

 despite the common durable archaeological finds. However, in N502, both thin carbonate ash
deposits and phosphatisation of the latter have contributed to bone/shell preservation. The
cementation has also helped to inhibit bioturbation as did, no doubt, the relatively damp to
wet condition developing in these sediments. The large capping roof-fall blocks have also
inhibited later burrow penetration and have slowly added ground carbonate. Yet another fac-
tor may be that, in much of the southern side of the cave, there are deep alcoves, suitable for
nesting birds and roosting bats, which would have contributed guano (aggressively acidic); in
contrast, the cave walls around N502 are quite vertical, leading up to a major roof opening,

 perhaps being less attractive for nesting/roosting. The outcome is that bone/shell preservation
in N502 is much better and the stratigraphic integrity and detail very much improved. Prelimi-
nary analysis of the faunal remains has identified auroch (Bos primigenius) among the large
mammal material, together with smaller mammals (including Hystrix cristata and unidentified
carnivores), reptiles (Testudo sp.), microfauna (S1 Table) and marine molluscs.
Only a broad level of correlation can be established between the various exposures of
Group 3: units r-o (N502) correlate with G3.3 (in L500-499 for example), whilst units h-a
(N502) correlate with G3.9–11. The general sedimentary sequence in the Group 3 material
in N502 shows two very clear trends. First, human influence was very strong, both in terms
of material input (lithics, bone, shell, charcoal, ash) and mass disturbance, at the base but
waned steadily upwards, even if it never completely disappeared. Second, the area was com-
paratively dry at the start but became increasingly wet, with ponding and eventually cur-
rent flow upwards (with much sorting of fine ash and charcoal inwards, to the east). The
presence of water in the cave would therefore have acted as a limitation to the floor space
available (driving actual ‘occupation’ up and westwards/outwards through time) but also as
an attractor in a generally sandy landscape, where a water source may well have been
useful.
The bone artefact was found lying in the deposit at a shallow, oblique angle such that the tip
appeared first, protruding slightly through the surface. When uncovered the bone seemed to
be intact, but the tip separated from the main portion of the tool during excavation. Concreted
sediment embedded within the broken edges indicates that the break occurred during burial,
probably as a result of trampling and sediment compression (Fig 2). The MSA lithic artefacts
associated with the bone tool in square N502 include typical MSA products such as a peduncu-
late piece and preferential radial Levallois cores (S2 Fig) which, with other components, are
common at similar levels elsewhere in the cave (S3 Fig).
The bone tool was found in a ‘sealed’ context, separated from the overlying LSA, Neo-
lithic and Protohistoric (Group 5) horizons by an intervening MSA deposit (Group 4),
which is more than 1.50 m thick. Furthermore, although 42 bone tools were discovered in
the Neolithic layer B and ‘Protohistoric’ layers (layers B and A, respectively) none of these
bone tools (which include a comb, two hooks, a hide-working tool, three worked teeth,
including a human molar, one sawn bone, a spear-like bone, one side scraper, two perfo-
rated needles, two pins, and 28 other bone points), share any similarities with the bone tool
from G3.v.
Radiometric age model
Two sequences of OSL determinations were used to model the age of deposition of G3-v. Pre-
viously published OSL ages (Sequence 1) [19] and a new series of OSL determinations
(Sequence 2) based on samples collected in 2012 from square N502 [20] were incorporated
into an updated Bayesian model using OxCalv4.2. Due to the different sampling strategies
used during different campaigns, the two datasets may initially be thought of as two indepen-
dent stratigraphic sequences. Whilst all OSL samples within each sequence can be ordered in
relation to every other sample within the same sequence, the only robust cross-correlations
between the sequences are the sedimentological boundaries between Groups 2 and 3, and
Groups 3 and 4. Therefore, the overall model incorporates the two stratigraphic sequences,
linked only by cross-referenced probabilities calculated for these particular boundaries (S4 Fig
and S2 Table). Other Group boundaries were extracted from a previous work [19] and data
sequence via the ‘Probability’ command. Replicate samples OSL 5a and 5b, and OSL 48a and
48b were entered as combined likelihoods.

 This model suggests that the deposition of unit G3-v occurred at approximately 90.41 ±
3.41 ka (OSL 43; S4 Fig and S2 Table). The estimate overlaps at 1 sigma uncertainty with the
un-modelled OSL age of 98.3 ± 9.3 ka, but makes allowance for the slight stratigraphic age
reversal between OSL 42 and OSL 43 (S4 Fig and S3 Table). The main effect of this model,
however, has been to increase the precision of the OSL ages for the new samples. There is
excellent agreement between the modelled ages for Sequence 1 obtained via the updated
model and the results previously published [19]. Ages are nearly identical, barring slight dis-
crepancies of less than 7 ka for samples OSL 5a/b and OSL 11. The new data indicates that
Group 1 was deposited prior to ~120 ka, with subsequent group boundaries occurring at
approximately 118ka, 97 ka, 73 ka, and 43 ka (S3 Table).

 The bone tool
Detailed observations of the bone tool from Dar es-Soltan 1 were conducted using standard
taphonomic analyses. The state of preservation was evaluated according to bone fragmentation
and soundness of cortical surface using established criteria [21–25]. Humanly-induced modifi-
cations were classified as slicing cut marks and scrape marks made during the production and
resharpening of the tool edge, flaking and polishing from use [26–31]. The artefact was initially
examined using a hand lens and binocular microscope. Detailed analyses of surface modifica-
tions were enhanced with observations at higher magnification using a scanning electron
microscope (SEM [32, 33]). The SEM (LEO1455VP) was operated in variable pressure mode
(chamber pressure 15 Pa), enabling back-scattered electron (BSE) images to be obtained with-
out the application of a conducting layer on the specimen. SEM images were taken in order to
conduct detailed analyses of surface modifications and use-wear patterns. Micro-computed
tomography (micro-CT) was performed to record the surface topography, to gauge the extent
of surface modifications and to resolve features in areas where the surface was obscured by
concretions. The specimen was scanned using a HMX-ST CT 225 System (Metris X-Tek,
Tring, UK). This scanner combines a cone beam projection system [34] with a four megapixel
Perkin Elmer XRD 1621 AN3 HS detector panel; different settings were used to optimize con-
trast and minimize beam hardening. The long axis of the bone tool was oriented vertically
with respect to the beam, thus ensuring maximum resolution whilst minimizing streak arte-
facts [35]. The micro-CT data were manipulated using CT-PRO software version 2.0 (Metris
X-Tek) and rendered using VG Studio MAX 2.1 (Volume Graphics, Heidelberg, Germany).
The Dar es-Soltan 1 bone tool was produced on an oblong ‘plaque’ of bone that is gently
curved both longitudinally and transversely (Fig 2). The dimensions, cortical thickness and
overall morphology of the trabeculae suggest it is formed from a portion of rib shaft, consistent
in size with a large mammal, probably from a bovid (Fig 3A).
The reconstructed length of the bone tool is 122 mm: the length of the main piece is 111
mm and the smaller piece is 12 mm long. We refer to the smaller piece as the ‘tip’ (distal end),
and the other end is defined as the ‘base’ (proximal end) of the implement. The width of the
tool varies from 18 mm to 27.5 mm along its length, resulting in a ‘fish-shaped’ outline with
tapered edges converging towards the rounded tip (Fig 2). The maximum thickness of the
piece at the base is 4.7 mm; scraping has reduced the thickness of the cortical bone to ~1.2 mm
at 5 mm from the tip.
The tool presents at least three flexion breaks and longitudinal internal cracks (Fig 2A). The
first flexion break (1 in Fig 2A) occurred transversely across the specimen at 17 to 18.5 mm
from the tip end. This resulted in two pieces now held together by sediment; the break caused
a slight deflection of the longitudinal profile. The shorter fragment then broke longitudinally
(2 in Fig 2A) and the narrower part was also bent, causing further distortion. Finally, a second
transverse break (3 in Fig 2A) separated the tip from the middle section. The base is broken
transversely probably during manufacture and shaping of the tool. This sequence of the breaks
and pattern of distortion would suggest that the tool was discarded in one piece and that the
three breaks towards the tip only occurred after deposition. No cut marks that can be unam-
biguously related to defleshing or skinning were observed on the rib fragment; however any
such marks could have been erased by repeated scraping of the bone surface associated with
the shaping of the tool (see below). Similarly, no traces from carnivore chewing or weathering
were observed.
Part of the tool is obscured by sediment still cemented onto the central area on both sides of
the specimen (Fig 2). This concretion matches the carbonates found in same sedimentary hori-
zon. After testing the feasibility of removing the adhering sediment from a small area at the

 proximal end, it was decided that further mechanical preparation would result in damage to
the surface (Figs 2B and 4O), and therefore the remaining sediment was left untouched.
The manufacture of the bone tool followed a succession of precise actions. The rib was first
modified to reduce its length and bisected longitudinally along the cranial and caudal edges to
produce a shorter and narrower ‘blank’. Adherent sediment along with subsequent scarping
and use wear (Fig 2) make it difficult to determine whether the breaks took place when the
bone was fresh or dry, or whether cutting, chipping or abrasion were used to shape the blank.
However, deliberate shaping of the rib is clearer on the sides of the implement, where the cra-
nial and caudal edges were modified to create more or less straight sides (Fig 3, micro-CT
scans 2 to 9). The removal of the cranial and caudal margins of the rib would have been under-
taken to facilitate longitudinal splitting of the rib into two halves. The longitudinal division of
the rib into two halves results in two surfaces: one cortical (we will refer to this as the ‘cortical
side’), and the other mainly composed of trabecular bone (‘trabecular side’; Fig 2). One edge is
much sharper due to further thinning of the cortical and trabecular surface by scraping and
flaking towards the tip (‘sharp edge’), whereas the other edge is more rounded with polishing
that obliterates the scraping marks along much of its length (‘smooth edge’).
Cortical side. Most of the cortical side is modified by long longitudinal scrape marks with
a main orientation parallel to the long axis of the bone. At higher magnification, the scrape
marks show broad zones of micro-striations (Fig 4A–4J and 4H–4L), which are typical of inci-
sions produced by a stone tool used in a scraping action (e.g. [36, 37]). On the cortical surface,
scrape marks extend for approximately 60 mm from the tip of the tool to where they become
hidden by the concretion; scrape marks appear to be on the basal exposed part of the cortical
surface. Scrape marks in proximity of the edges and the tip (Fig 4G, 4K and 4L) converge
towards the midline of the tool. They are particularly deep toward the tip of the tool, where

 more intensive and concentrated scraping has removed the cortical surface and exposed the
underlying osteons (Fig 4C, 4D, 4G, 4K and 4L). Towards the distal and mid portions of the
implement, (Fig 4I), scraping has produced a marks characterised by internal micro-‘waves’
perpendicular to the long axis of the scrape marks. These ‘chattermarks’ were produced when
the stone tool juddered across the bone surface due to the great pressure used during the scrap-
ing action. Fine overlapping striations perpendicular and oblique to the main axis of the tool,
are visible close to the sharp edge of the tip of the tool (Fig 4D, 4G, 4H and 4L); these marks
are interpreted as use-wear. In contrast, towards the smooth edge of the tool, more extensive
areas of polishing have obliterated the scrape marks (Fig 4A, 4B and 4E).
Trabecular side. On the trabecular side, the scrape marks are found primarily towards the
tip of the tool and appear to stop around 35 mm from the tip (Fig 5I and 5J). The scrape marks
are generally parallel to each other and more intense scraping occurred towards the tip. Here,
scraping has removed trabecular bone and exposed denser cortical bone beneath (Fig 5A–5I).
These modifications suggest that scraping was an integral component in the thinning and
shaping of the specimen (also observed at other MSA sites) [38, 39]. Use-wear in the form of
fine overlapping striations perpendicular and oblique to the main axis of the tool, is visible on
the trabecular surface close to the sharp edge of the tip of the implement (Fig 5A–5G). Use-
wear is more intense close to the tip of the tool and partially masks the earlier scrape marks.
Sharp edge.
The tip of the implement and the edge near the tip are sharp due to repeated
thinning of the cortical and trabecular surface by scraping and flaking (Fig 6A–6C). The flak-
ing of the cortical bone could have resulted from incidental damage during use. The edge
becomes smoother and polished in the basal and mid sections of the implement (Fig 6D, 6E
and 6G). A visible straight surface of the edge is particularly visible toward the mid-basal por-
tion of the tool (Fig 6F–6J).

 Smooth edge. While the tip of the bone knife is sharp (Fig 7A), this sharpness disappears
almost immediately along the smooth edge, substituted by a smooth polished surface (Fig 7B–7J).
Wear pattern in the form of pitting and scratches appears only in one area of this edge (Fig 7).
Use-wear is generally limited and it manifests in the form of fine overlapping striations perpen-
dicular and oblique to the main axis of the tool, visible on the trabecular, and, in fewer number,
on the cortical surfaces close to the flaked edge of the tip of the tool (Figs 2Cb and f, 4A, 4B, 4K,
4L and 5A–5G). The use-wear striations are absent towards the ‘smooth edge’ of the tool, where
they are substituted by large areas of polishing on both the trabecular and cortical sides. The pol-
ishing pattern, which masks the scrape marks in this area, is comparable to the effect of experi-
mental handling of osseous material [40]. A hypothesis, therefore, could be that the bone tool was
handled with one or more fingers firmly pressed against the smooth edge in proximity of the tip
of the tool while using the distal portion of the flaked edge for cutting. This type of handling
would be more typical of a knife, hence we suggest this tool was a bone knife, with multiple possi-
ble applications. The limited wear pattern, however, suggests that this particular knife was typi-
cally used for light duty work, possibly cutting of soft material [41]. The presence of flaking and
fine striations also suggests occasional contact with more resilient material.
Discussion and conclusions
One of the diagnostic indicators of cognitive complexity is the presence of specialised or for-
mal bone tools [42, 43], defined as functional artefacts shaped and modified using techniques
such as scraping, grinding, grooving and polishing [38]. Specialised tools were previously only
known from the Old World Upper Palaeolithic with few examples recently reported for the
Middle Palaeolithic of Europe [44]. In Africa, their antiquity extends back into the Middle
Stone Age [38, 42, 45] (Fig 8A).

 The oldest specialised bone tools so far known from sub-Saharan Africa come from
Katanda (Democratic Republic of Congo) and are dated to ~90 ka [42]. These examples
include delicately worked barbed harpoons and are unlike the artefacts from Morocco. Else-
where, in South Africa, pointed bone tools have been recovered in the Stillbay (SB) layers of
Blombos Cave (M2 phase) dating to between ~84 and 76 ka [46–48], while at Sibudu Cave a

[6, 38]. Examples from slightly younger contexts have been recorded at Border Cave [49].
With the exception of the specialized bone tools from Sibudu Cave and Katanda, these early
finds are restricted to pointed forms.
With a date of approximately 90 ka, the tool from Dar es-Soltan 1 represents the oldest spe-
cialised bone tool yet found in a well-dated context that is clearly associated with the Aterian
culture. Eleven osseous artefacts have previously been described from Aterian deposits from El
Mnasra cave, which have been dated by OSL to approximately 111–106 ka [17, 18] and by
ESR-U/Th to approximately 89-67ka [15, 50]. Two of these bone objects (D11-T194 and refit
of E9-233 with E9-229) have characteristics similar to the Dar es-Soltan 1 bone knife. Both
were produced on ribs of large mammals that were modified in a way comparable to the chaîne
opératoire adopted for the Dar es-Soltan 1 bone tool. One of the tools (refit of E9-233 with E9-
229) is produced on a rib of a mammal of smaller dimensions than Dar es-Soltan 1. It has not
been split into two halves, as with the Dar es-Soltan 1 knife, but its bone surfaces were also
thinned by repeated scraping. D11-T194 has overall dimensions comparable with the Dar es-
Soltan 1 knife, and it was split longitudinally into two halves in a similar way. Both the cortical
and trabecular surfaces were further thinned by repeated scraping of the surface to produce an
elongated slender object [14, 15] (Fig 9).
The measurements of the tips of the El Mnasra bone tools match those of the tip of the
bone knife from Dar es-Soltan 1, confirming that not only the manufacture but also the
dimensions of these artefacts are remarkably similar (Fig 8B and S3 Table). We suggest that
these bone tools from El Mnasra and Dar es-Soltan 1 have characteristics typical of bone

 knives and that the use-wear present on the Dar es-Soltan 1 knife indicates a possible use for
cutting soft material.
The production of this new type of tool may be related to changes in the pattern of resource
exploitation by humans. The period around 90 ka corresponds to an increase in the availability
of marine resources, and it is possible that new tools were necessary to accomplish new tasks.
Further archaeological discoveries and experimental work should establish whether there is a
direct association between these implements and the exploitation of marine resources.
Regardless of how the bone knives from Dar es-Soltan 1 and El Mnasra were used, the com-
plex and controlled sequence of actions involved in their manufacture is so far unique in the
Aterian archaeological record. Equally unique are their shape and dimensions, which separate
them from other formal bone tools found in MSA Sub-Saharan African sites (e.g. bone points
and awls) as well as spatulae and lissoirs from Upper and Middle Palaeolithic European sites
(Fig 8C and S3 File). Such bone technology is another distinctive characteristic associated with
the precocious appearance of symbolic artefacts and suggest the emergence of an independent
modern techno-complex unique to the Aterian culture in North Africa around ~100 ka.
