Abstract
Background: Recent studies have proposed that humans may perceive complex carbohydrates and that sensitivity to
simple carbohydrates is independent of sensitivity to complex carbohydrates. Variation in oral complex carbohydrate
sensitivity may influence food consumption.
Objective: This study aimed to investigate the associations between oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity, anthropom-
etry, and dietary intake in adults.
Methods: We assessed oral sensitivity to complex carbohydrates (maltodextrin and oligofructose) by measuring
detection thresholds (DTs) and suprathreshold intensity perceptions (STs) for 34 participants, including 16 men (mean 6
SEM age : 26.2 6 0.4 y; range: 24–30 y) and 18 women (age: 29.4 6 2.1 y; range: 24–55 y). We also measured height,
weight, and waist circumference (WC) and participants completed a 4-d food diary and a food-frequency questionnaire.
Results: Measurements of oral sensitivity to complex carbohydrates were significantly correlated with WC and dietary
energy and starch intakes (DT: r = –0.38, P < 0.05; ST: r = 0.36–0.48, P < 0.05). When participants were grouped into
tertiles, there were significant differences in WC and total energy or starch intakes for those who were more sensitive or
experienced high intensity compared with those who were less sensitive or experienced low intensity. Being more
sensitive or experiencing high intensity was associated with greater energy (7968–8954 kJ/d) and starch (29.1–29.8% of
energy) intakes and a greater WC (88.2–91.4 cm) than was being less sensitive or experiencing low intensity (6693–
7747 kJ/d, 20.9–22.2% of energy, and 75.5–80.5 cm, respectively).
Conclusion: Complex carbohydrate sensing is associated with WC and consumption of complex carbohydrates and
energy in adults. This trial was registered at anzctr.org.au as ACTRN12616001356459.

Introduction
Increased energy intake is thought to be a major contributor to
the global increase in overweight and obesity (1, 2). Simple and
complex carbohydrates represent a major source of energy in the
human diet. With the exception of certain fruits (e.g., grapes and
mangoes), plants contain many more complex carbohydrates than
simple carbohydrates; however, sugar is the most sought-after
carbohydrate because of its hedonically pleasing sweet taste (3–5).
The function of complex carbohydrates in the diet has changed
considerably since the introduction of agriculture ;8000–10,000
years ago (6). The independent origin of salivary amylase to digest
complex carbohydrates in the oral cavity in rodents and primates
suggests that there has been strong evolutionary selection for
amylase in saliva [reviewed in Meisler and Ting (7)]. Considering
that the physiologic function of many taste receptors (also called
nutrient sensors) within the oral cavity is to sense the nutritious or
toxic qualities in foods (5, 6), logically, components of complex
carbohydrates would be detected in the mouth, similar to other
nutritive components such as proteins (e.g., monosodium gluta-
mate) and fats (e.g., oleic acid) (8–18). In contrast with simple

 carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates have long been assumed
to be imperceptible to the human palate (19, 20) and they thus
have been used as tasteless caloric ingredients in flavor-nutrient
conditioning studies (21–23). Conversely, current evidence sug-
gests that humans may perceive complex carbohydrates and that
sensitivity to simple carbohydrates is independent of sensitivity to
complex carbohydrates (i.e., perceived intensities for simple carbo-
hydrates such as glucose and sucrose were significantly correlated
with each other, but not with complex carbohydrates) (24, 25).
Individual differences in taste sensitivity and the role of taste in
promoting intake of specific foods or ingredients associated with
obesity have long been investigated but results are mixed (9, 10,
16, 26–31). To our knowledge, the relation between environ-
mental influences such as habitual diet and sweet taste sensitivity
is complicated because most data to date have shown no link
between sweet taste sensitivity, BMI (in kg/m2), and dietary intake
(31–33). Whether habituation occurs for complex carbohydrates
remains unclear and is of particular interest in order to under-
stand why some individuals consume more energy than others.
This study aimed to investigate the associations of oral
complex carbohydrate sensitivity, anthropometry, and dietary
intake among adults. Oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity is a
conservative term for ‘‘carbohydrate taste.’’ More research is
needed to confirm whether carbohydrate is indeed a taste.
Methods
Study design. This study comprised 15 laboratory-based sessions in
which demographic (age and sex), anthropometric [height, weight, and
waist circumference (WC)], and dietary (4-d food diary and FFQ) data
were collected. Data on 2 measures of taste perception routinely used in
chemosensory research [detection thresholds (DTs) and suprathreshold
intensity perceptions (STs)] were also collected. These measurements
were obtained from all participants for 2 complex carbohydrates (a
soluble starch maltodextrin and a soluble fiber oligofructose). Figure 1
outlines the 15 laboratory-based sessions. Participants performed the
DT and ST tasks in computerized, partitioned sensory booths at the
Centre for Advanced Sensory Science (School of Exercise and Nutrition
Sciences, Deakin University) using Compusense Cloud software as part
of the Compusense Academic Consortium (Compusense Inc.). Our study
participants were part of a larger study focusing on the psychophysics
of oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity (JY Low, RL McBride, KE Lacy,
RSJ Keast, unpublished results, 2017) and sweet taste function (33, 34).
Participants. Participants [(n 5 34): 16 men (mean 6 SEM age: 26.2 6
0.4 y; range: 24–30 y) and 18 women (age: 29.4 6 2.1 y; range: 24–55 y)]
were recruited via e-mail and flyer distribution from locations adjacent
to the Melbourne Burwood campus of Deakin University, Australia.
Potential participants were excluded if they were: 1) smokers; 2) pregnant
or lactating; 3) taking any prescription medication that may interfere with
their ability to taste; or 4) had a history of food allergies that may interfere
with the study. Standardizing protocols before each testing session were
similar to those outlined in Low et al. (33, 34). The Deakin University
Institutional Review Board (HEAG_H_182_2014) approved this study.
The experimental protocol was also registered at anzctr.org.au as
ACTRN12616001356459 and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Participant training. Participants used the general labeled magnitude
scale (gLMS) to rate taste intensity and received training according to the
standard protocol outlined by Green et al. (35, 36), except we described
the top of the scale as the strongest imaginable sensation of any kind
(38). This method was described in Low et al. (33, 34).
Stimuli. Maltodextrin (Star-Dri 5; Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas
LLC) and oligofructose (Fibrulose F97; Cosucra-Groupe Warcoing) were
used to investigate oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity (Table 1). We
used maltodextrin with a dextrose equivalent of 5 because it contains the
lowest possible amount of free sugars (glucose and maltose) but is water
soluble. The dextrose equivalent is a measure of the percentage of
reducing sugars relative to glucose on a dry basis (38).
Analysis of common sugars in maltodextrin and oligofructose
samples. To determine whether the maltodextrin and oligofructose used
in this study would be suitable, 4% wt:vol maltodextrin and oligofructose
solutions were prepared for HPLC. The complex carbohydrate extracts
were clarified with 25 mL acetonitrile and filtered through a 0.45-mm filter
into a 2-mL vial. To determine the amount of common sugars in samples,
filtered solutions were analyzed by HPLC using an amino column with
an acetonitrile:water mobile phase containing salt and refractive index
detection. Samples were measured in duplicate.
In this study, the total amount of free sugars was 2.8 g free sugars/100 g
(2.8% wt:wt) for maltodextrin (glucose: 0.8% wt:wt) and 3.0 g free
sugars/100 g (3.0% wt:wt) for oligofructose (fructose: 1.4% wt:wt)
(Supplemental Table 1 provides the composition of the complex carbohy-
drates used in this study). Table 1 provides the amounts of common sugars
and total sugars present in each complex carbohydrate DT concentration.

 previously published findings of perceptually distinctive taste sensation
concentrations (24, 39) without perceivable viscosity. After pilot testing
was performed, a concentration range of 0.4–200 g/L was used to
measure DT levels for complex carbohydrates. DTs for each of the
complex carbohydrates were obtained using an ascending-series, 3-alternate
forced choice method (9, 40), in which participants were provided sets of
three 25-mL samples (2 control samples with filtered deionized water
and 1 sample with complex carbohydrate) in ascending order from the
lowest to highest concentration. The DT was defined as the concentra-
tion of complex carbohydrate required for a participant to correctly
identify the complex carbohydrate sample as the odd one out in 3 con-
secutive sample sets at 1 concentration (40).
STs for complex carbohydrates. Four concentrations of complex
carbohydrate solution (weak, moderate, moderate-strong, or strong) and a
control (blank) solution were prepared to determine the perceived ST for
each complex carbohydrate (Table 2). These concentrations were derived
through informal bench-top testing (ascending intensity). The concentra-
tions for each stimulus ranged from ‘‘weak’’ to ‘‘strong’’ on the gLMS. These
samples were presented to participants in a randomized order.
Standardization of gLMS usage with weight ratings. To standardize
gLMS usage among participants, a modified version of the method used
by Delwiche et al. (41) was adapted for this study (33, 34). There was a
significant correlation between overall mean prototypical ratings and
overall mean heaviness ratings (r = 0.39, P < 0.05) (Supplemental Table 2
presents the concentration of prototypical tastants used for determina-
tion of taste intensity perception). To determine a personal standardi-
zation factor, the grand mean for heaviness across weight levels and
participants was divided by each participant�s mean intensity for
heaviness (42). Each individual�s intensity ratings were multiplied by
his or her personal standardization factor for scale-use bias (41, 42).
Anthropometry. Participants were asked to remove their shoes and any
heavy clothing to ensure accurate anthropometric measurements. All
anthropometric measurements were measured first thing during the
initial and final visits after a 1-h fast (food only). Body weight was
measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a segmental body composition
analyzer (TBF-300A; Tanita Corporation). Participants� height was
measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer (Seca213;
Seca). All measurements were repeated twice to ensure accuracy. Mean
height and weight was used to calculate BMI and determine weight status
(i.e., normal weight or overweight or obese). Weight status was defined
using the WHO BMI classification (43). We used methods outlined by the
National Heart Foundation of Australia to measure WC (44). WC was
measured twice to the nearest 0.1 cm using an ergonomic circumference
measurement tape (Seca201; Seca). Mean WC was calculated and used for
analysis. We followed WHO recommendations to define WC cutoff points
(i.e., lower risk of metabolic complications or increased risk of metabolic
complications; >94 cm for men and >80 cm for women) (45).
Dietary intake. We used a validated version of the FFQ (46, 47) developed
by Cancer Council Victoria to measure each participant�s habitual pattern
of food intake (34). Participants were also asked to complete a 4-d food
diary (3 weekdays and 1 weekend day within a 7-d period) within a month
from their first visit, in which they recorded all of the foods and beverages
they consumed. In addition, participants were asked to, where possible,
measure their foods using measurement cups, spoons, or common serving
sizes (e.g., 1 large egg) or to weigh their foods using kitchen scales at home.
They were also asked to be as specific as possible, including reporting the
type (e.g., skim milk or full-fat milk) and brand of food consumed, the
cooking methods used (e.g., fried, baked, or steamed), and whether fat was
added during cooking (e.g., food cooked in butter or cooking oil). Food
diaries were analyzed using FoodWorks 8 software (Xyris Software). Mean
energy intake (expressed in kJ/d), macronutrient distribution (expressed as
the percentage of energy from fat, protein, or carbohydrate), and type of
carbohydrate (expressed as the percentage of energy from starch, sugar, or
fiber) were quantified using the Australian AUS NUT 2011–2013 nutrient
composition database (48) and compliance was checked. Two dietary
assessment methods were used to assess dietary intake because they
measure 2 different time periods (i.e., a year and 4 d) and thus would
provide a better representation of an individual�s dietary intake.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
statistical software (version 23.0; IBM SPSS). Data are presented as means 6
SEMs. Descriptive statistics were employed to describe demographic
information, complex carbohydrate DTs and STs, and dietary intake. DTs
and STs were determined as the arithmetic mean of the repeated measures.
For STs, the geometric mean score of the 4 ratings (weak, moderate,
moderate-strong, and strong) was calculated (49). Over- and under-reporters
of dietary intake were checked for out-of-range values for energy intake and
participants with outlying values (energy intake >2 SD above or below the
mean energy intake) were removed from further dietary analyses (50). For
BMI and WC analyses, all participants were included in the analysis.
Independent t tests were used to analyze differences in oral complex
carbohydrate sensitivity (DTs and STs for both complex carbohydrates)
between sexes. Pearson�s product-moment correlation coefficients were
also calculated to analyze the relation between oral complex carbohy-
drate sensitivity (DTs and STs for both complex carbohydrates) and
BMI, WC, and dietary intake (primary outcomes). To explore differences
between continuous variables (WC, BMI, habitual energy intake, and

1 The concentration series for maltodextrin and oligofructose were prepared with 12 successive 0.25-log dilution steps. Reference chemicals were maltodextrin (Star-Dri 5; Tate & Lyle
Ingredients Americas) and oligofructose (Fibrulose F97; Cosucra-Groupe Warcoing). The amount of common and total sugars in maltodextrin and oligofructose concentrations was
calculated from samples used in this study according to an Australian Government National Measurement Institute report (Supplemental Table 1). In this study, the total amount of free
sugars was 2.8 g free sugars/100 g (2.8% wt:wt) for maltodextrin (glucose: 0.8% wt:wt) and 3.0 g free sugars/100 g (3.0% wt:wt) for oligofructose (fructose: 1.4% wt:wt).

 macronutrient intakes; primary outcomes), the DT for each complex
carbohydrate was treated as a grouping variable (tertiles) and participants
were categorized as experiencing more sensitivity (tertile 1), normal
sensitivity (tertile 2), or less sensitivity (tertile 3). This same analysis was
performed with the ST for each complex carbohydrate. DTs and STs for
both complex carbohydrates were grouped into tertiles to allow comparison
of the most and least sensitive groupings and of those who experienced low
and high intensity (i.e., 4 sets of tertiles were determined: 1 for the DT for
each complex carbohydrate and 1 for the ST for each complex carbohy-
drate). Independent t tests were used to detect differences in habitual energy
intake, BMI, and WC between more sensitive and less sensitive participants
or those who experienced low and high intensity (lower and higher tertile
groups). Independent t tests were used to detect differences in the diet
between more sensitive and less sensitive participants or those who experi-
enced low and high intensity, with macronutrient composition (i.e., per-
centage of dietary energy from starch, fiber, sugar, and carbohydrate) as a
dependent variable and oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity (DTs and
STs for both complex carbohydrates) as the independent variable.
Independent t tests were used to analyze differences in dietary intake and
oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity between weight status categories,
WC risk groups, and sex (secondary outcomes). We calculated Pearson�s
product-moment correlation coefficients to analyze the relation between
dietary assessment tools (i.e., dietary intake measured using the 4-d food
diaries and FFQs; secondary outcomes). Significance was accepted at P < 0.05.
Results
Participants. We recruited 34 participants, including 16 men
with a mean age of 26.2 6 0.4 y (range: 24.0–30.0 y), a mean BMI
of 25.2 6 0.9 (range: 18.9–30.0), and a mean WC of 89.0 6 3.0
cm (range: 73.0–106.0 cm) and 18 women with a mean age of
29.4 6 2.1 y (range: 24.0–55.0 y), a mean BMI of 24.3 6 0.8
(range: 20.0–29.6), and a mean WC of 78.2 6 1.5 cm (range:
68.0–85.5 cm). Eighteen participants were classified as overweight
or obese, including 7 men and 11 women with a mean BMI of 27.4 6
0.5 (range: 25.2–30.0) and a mean WC of 88.8 6 2.2 cm (range:
75.2–106.0 cm). There were no significant differences in BMI or
age between men and women (all P > 0.05). However, women
had a significantly smaller WC than men (P < 0.01) (Supplemental
Table 3 provides baseline characteristics of the study participants).
Oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity of maltodextrin and
oligofructose. There were no significant differences in oral
complex carbohydrate sensitivity (DTs and STs for both com-
plex carbohydrates) between men and women (all P > 0.05);
therefore, these data are presented together. Table 3 presents
mean values and ranges for DTs, STs, and both complex
carbohydrates (Supplemental Table 4 provides mean ratings
across concentrations for the cohort and by tertile groups).
Oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity and anthropometry.
No significant correlations were identified between any mea-
sures of oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity (DTs and STs)
and BMI for either complex carbohydrate (all P > 0.05). Similarly,
when participants were grouped into tertiles according to oral
complex carbohydrate sensitivity (DTs and STs for both complex
carbohydrates), there were no significant differences in BMI
between the more sensitive and less sensitive participants or
participants who experienced high or low intensity for either
complex carbohydrate (all P > 0.05) (Figure 2A and B ). When
participants were stratified by weight status, there were no
significant differences in any measure of oral complex carbohy-
drate sensitivity (DTs and STs for both complex carbohydrates)
between normal weight and overweight or obese participants (all
P > 0.05). However, significant correlations were observed
between oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity and WC for the
maltodextrin DT (r = 20.38, P < 0.05), maltodextrin ST (r = 0.48,
P < 0.05), and oligofructose ST (r = 0.42, P < 0.05), but not for
the oligofructose DT (r = 20.30, P = 0.08). Likewise, when
participants were grouped into tertiles according to oral complex
carbohydrate sensitivity (DTs and STs for both complex carbohy-
drates), there were significant differences in WC between the more
sensitive and less sensitive participants for maltodextrin (Figure
2C). There were also significant differences in WC between
participants who experienced high or low intensity for either
complex carbohydrate (Figure 2D). Participants who were more
sensitive to maltodextrin (DT) had larger WCs than less sensitive
participants (P < 0.05). For intensity ratings, participants who
experienced high intensity ratings for both complex carbohydrates
(maltodextrin and oligofructose) had larger WCs than those who
experienced low intensity (all P < 0.01). Similar relations were
observed when participants were stratified into WC risk groups;
there were significant differences in STs of complex carbohydrates
between participants with a lower WC (mean ST gLMS: 6.1 for
maltodextrin and 6.7 for oligofructose) and those with a higher
WC (mean ST gLMS: 16.3 for maltodextrin and 15.8 for
oligofructose) (all P < 0.01). However, there were no significant
differences for DT complex carbohydrate measurements when
participants were stratified into WC risk groups (P > 0.05).
Oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity and energy and
macronutrient intakes. Analysis of the food diary records
identified 1 participant as an under-reporter of energy intake,
with energy intake >2 SD (1485 kJ/d) below the mean energy
intake (7656 kJ/d). Analysis of the FFQs identified 2 participants
as over-reporters of energy intake, with energy intake >2 SD
(2381 kJ/d) above the mean energy intake (7204 kJ/d). These 3
participants were removed from further dietary analyses. Mean
energy and macronutrient intakes are reported in Table 4.
We found no robust associations between measures of oral
complex carbohydrate sensitivity (DTs and STs) and the percentage
of energy from fat, protein, carbohydrate, sugar, starch, or fiber
when dietary intakes were calculated from food diaries. However,
we found a significant correlation between mean total energy
intake and maltodextrin STs (r = 0.39, P < 0.05). When participants
were grouped into tertiles, independent t tests revealed significant
differences between those who experienced low and high intensity
in terms of mean total energy consumed per day (Figure 3B).
Participants who experienced high intensity to maltodextrin
solutions consumed significantly more energy per day than did
those who experienced low intensity (P < 0.01). No significant
correlations were identified for mean total energy intake and
maltodextrin DTs (r = 0.04, P = 0.84), oligofructose DTs (r = 0.14,
P = 0.45), or oligofructose intensity ratings (r = 0.33, P = 0.06).
Using the FFQ as a measurement of dietary intake, no
significant correlations between DT, mean total energy intake,
and percentage of energy from fat, protein, carbohydrate, sugar,
starch, or fiber were observed (all P > 0.05). However, when
participants were grouped into tertiles, independent t tests

 revealed significant differences between more sensitive and less
sensitive participants (maltodextrin DT) in terms of mean total
energy consumed per day (Figure 3A). Participants who were
more sensitive to maltodextrin (DT) consumed significantly
more energy per day than less sensitive participants (P < 0.05). For
STs, significant correlations were observed between mean total
energy intake and maltodextrin STs (r = 0.37, P < 0.05). When
participants were grouped into tertiles, those who experienced
high intensity to maltodextrin solutions consumed significantly
more energy per day than did those who experienced low intensity
(P < 0.05; Figure 3B). No significant correlations were identified
for mean total energy intake and oligofructose STs (r = 0.29,
P = 0.09). Interestingly, significant correlations were observed
between the percentage of energy from starch and STs for both
complex carbohydrates (maltodextrin: r = 0.40, P < 0.05;
oligofructose: r = 0.36, P < 0.05). When participants were
grouped into tertiles, those who experienced high intensity to both
maltodextrin and oligofructose consumed significantly more
energy from starch than those who experienced low intensity
(P < 0.05; Figure 3D). No correlations were observed between STs
for complex carbohydrates and the percentage of energy from fat,
protein, carbohydrate, sugar, or fiber (all P > 0.05). No robust
differences were observed between men and women in terms of the
associations between measures of oral complex carbohydrate
sensitivity (DTs and STs) and energy intake (not reported).
Associations between anthropometric measurements and
dietary intake. When participants were stratified into weight
status categories, there were no significant differences in dietary
intake between individuals who were normal weight and those
who were overweight or obese (all P > 0.05). Similarly, for WC,
there were no significant differences in dietary intake between
participants with a lower risk of metabolic complications and those
with an increased risk of metabolic complications (all P > 0.05).
Correlations between dietary assessment tools. There were
significant correlations for total energy intake and the percent-
age of energy per day from carbohydrate, sugar, starch, fiber, or
protein between the 4-d food diaries and FFQs (all P < 0.05).
However, no significant correlations for dietary fat were
observed between the 2 dietary assessment tools (P > 0.05).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine whether oral
complex carbohydrate sensitivity (DTs and STs for both complex
carbohydrates) is related to body composition measurements (BMI
and WC) or dietary intake (energy and macronutrient intakes).
These results reveal an association between complex carbohydrate
sensing and consumption of complex carbohydrates, which may
influence WC.
Individual differences in any or several nutrient receptors are
known to influence intake of specific foods or food components

 related to the nutrient receptor (51). In this study, participants
who were more orally sensitive or experienced high intensity
to complex carbohydrates (maltodextrin and oligofructose, but
mostly for maltodextrin) tended to consume more energy (both
food diary and FFQ data) and starchy foods (FFQ data) per day
than did participants who were less sensitive or experienced low
intensity to complex carbohydrates. It could be argued that the
physiologic regulation and functional significance of sensing low
amounts of complex carbohydrates could be an advantage,
because complex carbohydrates represent a major source of
energy for physiologic function. It was recently suggested that
sweet taste perception or the degree of sweetness is not a good
proxy for the amount of energy available in a food (4, 52).
Rather, a detection mechanism that encourages consumption of
complex carbohydrate independent from sweet taste may be
advantageous for providing quantitative information about the
energy (glucose) content for physiologic functioning (4, 5).
These results could also be partly explained by animal models.
For example, Sclafani (53) investigated the effects of carbohy-
drate type (simple and complex) on body weight and diet in rats;
no significant differences in total caloric intake, weight gain,
percentage of body fat, or basal insulin level were observed between
groups of rats fed either simple or complex carbohydrate solutions
in addition to chow and water for 40 d. However, rats that received
the complex carbohydrate (maltodextrin) solution consumed sig-
nificantly more maltodextrin solution over the 40-d period than did
rats that received the simple carbohydrate solution (53), suggesting
that long-term exposure to complex carbohydrates does not reduce
subsequent intake of complex carbohydrates. Although differences
in rats� sensitivity to complex carbohydrates were not investigated,
in the context of what we found in this study, it is possible that
the more sensitive participants or those who experienced high
intensity consumed more energy and starch because they could
sense complex carbohydrates in foods with lower amounts of
complex carbohydrates than less sensitive participants or those
who experienced low intensity (i.e., some participants in our
study could detect complex carbohydrates as low as 0.4 g/L in
water). Given that complex carbohydrates such as maltodextrin
are commonly used in low amounts as a food additive in a wide
range of products, more sensitive participants or those who ex-
perience high intensity could find these products more palatable and
thus consume them in higher quantities than less sensitive partic-
ipants or those who experienced low intensity. However, we did not
measure participants� liking of foods, so we do not know whether
more and less sensitive participants or those who experienced high
or low intensity differ in their liking of starchy foods.
We observed that WC differed between more and less sensitive
participants and those who experienced high or low intensity for
all complex carbohydrate measures (except oligofructose DT) and
that oral sensitivity to complex carbohydrates (DTs and STs) was
also negatively associated with energy and starch intakes. These
findings raise the possibility that regulation of food intake may be
regulated, in part, by both oral sensory and postdigestive nutritive
feedback. That is, it is possible that individuals with heightened
oral sensitivity responses to complex carbohydrates may have
developed preferences for complex carbohydrate flavors as a result
of postdigestive nutritive cues (conditioned preferences), leading to
greater intake of energy and starch and thus weight gain (54–56).
Postdigestive modulation of complex carbohydrate intake was
established previously in rat models. For example, Sclafani and
Nissenbaum (57) observed that rats rapidly develop preferences
for flavors associated with intragastric infusions of maltodextrin.
It is also possible that a high-starch diet may induce salivary
a-amylase levels. Thus, it is possible that those who consume more
energy and starchy foods per day (and have a higher WC) may be
more orally sensitive to maltodextrin solution across the whole
psychophysical range because they have higher a-amylase activity.
Significant relations were observed for WC and oral sensi-
tivity to complex carbohydrates, but not for BMI measurements.
Although BMI measurements (weight distribution) are widely

 used to evaluate obesity in adults (58, 59) and children (60, 61),
previous studies showed that abdominal obesity assessed by WC
is a stronger predictor of obesity-related health risk (62). It is
possible that no significant relations were observed between BMI
and oral sensitivity to complex carbohydrates, because the
distribution of fat in the body (particularly around the abdomen),
as measured by WC might be a better indicator of weight gain as a
result of greater energy and starch intake for individuals with
heightened oral sensitivity responses to complex carbohydrates
(63). Furthermore, it is also possible that the discrepancies in
results between WC and BMI measurements could be attributable
to the overlap between WC cutoff points for normal-weight or
obese participants. In other words, some normal-weight partic-
ipants had WCs above the cutoff and some overweight or obese
participants had WCs below the cutoff (e.g., one female partic-
ipant had a WC of 95.7 cm but a BMI of 24.7, and one male
participant had a WC of 75.2 cm but a BMI of 25.9).
There are some limitations that must be taken into account
when considering our results. First, it is important to acknowl-
edge that perception of tastant solutions in a laboratory setting
bears little relevance to actual intake of real food in everyday life
(63). Second, although many participants were able to consis-
tently differentiate complex carbohydrate solutions from water
even at low concentrations (i.e., 0.4 g/L), more evidence is
required to ensure that the DTs and STs reported were not a result
of textural cues such as tribology studies (study of oral processing
and mouth feel). It is possible that differences were observed
between subjects in terms of oral complex carbohydrate sensitiv-
ity because the participants simply differed in their sensitivity to
the viscosity of the complex carbohydrate solutions. Furthermore,
there was an unequal distribution between men and women in the
BMI groups, which may have reduced the prospect of seeing any
influence of BMI. Finally, the approach of categorizing the oral
complex carbohydrate sensitivity measures into tertiles likely
reduces the power of this study. However, we also examined the
associations between sensitivity measures, anthropometry, and
energy and macronutrient intakes using continuous data. Con-
sidering that both approaches generally produced the same
outcomes, this gave confidence to the reliability of the results.
In conclusion, participants who were orally more sensitive or
those who experienced high intensity for complex carbohydrates
consumed more energy and starchy foods per day and had larger
WC measurements than participants who were orally less sen-
sitive or experienced low intensity. These results suggest that
oral complex carbohydrate sensitivity could play a role in energy
and starch intake regulation.
