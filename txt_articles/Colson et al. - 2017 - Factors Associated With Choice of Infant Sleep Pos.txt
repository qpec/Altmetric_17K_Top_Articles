BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants be placed 
supine for sleep. Our objectives in this study were to, in a nationally representative sample, 
examine (1) prevalence of maternal intention regarding infant sleeping position and of 
actual practice and (2) factors associated with their choices.
METHODS: We recruited mothers from 32 US hospitals, oversampling African American and 
Hispanic mothers, in a nationally representative sample of mothers of infants aged 2 to 
6 months. Survey questions assessed choice of usual infant sleeping position, all sleeping 
positions, intention for sleep position, as well as actual practice. Multivariable logistic 
regression analyses controlled for demographic, receipt of doctor advice, and theory of 
planned behavior variables (attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control).
RESULTS: Of the 3297 mothers, 77.3% reported they usually placed their infants in the supine 
position for sleep, but fewer than half reported that they exclusively did so. Only 43.7% 
of mothers reported that they both intended to and then actually placed their infants 
exclusively supine. African American mothers and those who did not complete high school 
were more likely to intend to use the prone position. Theory of planned behavior factors 
(attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control) and doctor advice were associated with 
maternal choice.
CONCLUSIONS: Not all mothers place their infants exclusively supine for sleep. Many mothers 
intend to place their infants supine yet often do not do so in actual practice. Factors 
potentially amenable to intervention including attitudes, subjective norms, and doctor 
advice are associated with intention and practice.

WhAt’S KNOWN ON thIS SUbjECt: Each year infants 
die of unsafe sleep practices. Placing infants in the 
supine position for sleep reduces the risk of dying, 
yet infants continue to be placed in other than the 
supine position for sleep.
WhAt thIS StUDy ADDS: Using a national sample, 
we present recent data about the prevalence of 
mothers’ intentions and also of actual practice 
regarding infant sleep position and uncover 
factors associated with this choice that are 
potentially amenable to change through educational 
interventions.

 Sudden unexpected infant death, 
which includes sudden infant death 
syndrome (SIDS), remains the leading 
cause of postneonatal infant death in 
the United States.1 Between 2011 and 
2014, there were 6683 infant deaths 
reported from SIDS (0.42/1000 live 
births) and an additional 3029 infant 
deaths from accidental suffocation 
and strangulation in bed (0.19/1000 
live births).2 During this same 
period, the number of SIDS deaths 
varied by race and ethnicity, with 
the death rate for non-Hispanic 
African American infants of 0.76 
per 1000 live births compared 
with Hispanic infants of 0.25 per 
1000 live births.2 To decrease 
sudden unexpected infant death, 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) has recommended since 2005 
that infants be placed exclusively 
in the supine position for sleep.3 
Despite this recommendation, not all 
infants are placed supine for sleep. In 
our previous report in which we used 
data from the National Infant Sleep 
Position (NISP) study, a telephone 
survey, we found that in 2007, almost 
72% of caregivers reported that 
they usually placed their infants in 
the supine position for sleep.4 The 
percentage placed in the supine 
position for sleep varied by race, with 
African American mothers least likely 
to usually place their infants supine 
for sleep. Like others, we found that 
the choice to place infants supine was 
also associated with the caregiver’s 
beliefs about comfort and choking.4, 
 
5 
In addition, compared with mothers 
with less than a college education, 
those with a college education were 
more likely to place their infants 
in the supine position as were 
those who reported being told by a 
doctor to place their infants to sleep 
exclusively in the supine position.4 
The NISP study, sponsored by the 
National Institutes of Health as a 
vehicle for following national trends 
related to safe infant sleep, included 
caregivers from across the country; 
however, as a telephone survey, it 
underrepresented important groups 
of infant caregivers (including African 
American and Hispanic mothers) and 
was therefore not felt to be the ideal 
way to track prevalence in behavior 
nationally.
For that reason, with continued 
sponsorship of the National Institutes 
of Health, we have replaced the NISP 
telephone survey methodology for 
tracking infant care practices with 
the new Study of Attitudes and 
Factors Effecting Infant Care (SAFE), 
which includes responses collected 
prospectively from a nationally 
representative sample of mothers 
recruited directly from hospital 
postpartum units. In addition to 
providing nationally representative 
data about the prevalence of supine 
sleep and other recommended safe 
sleep practices, the SAFE study 
included 2 other major advantages 
compared with the NISP study.
First, to understand better what 
drives maternal choices, we added 
questions on the basis of the theory 
of planned behavior, 
6 which posits 
that attitudes toward a behavior, 
subjective social norms, and 
perceptions about control over 
the behavior all have an impact on 
whether one has the intention to do 
a particular behavior. For example, 
attitude, subjective social norms, and 
perceived control might contribute to 
intention to exercise to lose weight, 
7, 
 
8  
or relevant to our current report, 
intent to follow the recommendation 
to place their infant supine for 
sleep. Studies in which the theory of 
planned behavior is used are based 
on the supposition that behavior is 
a complex construct and that what 
people intend to do (lose weight or 
exercise) is not always aligned with 
what they actually do in practice. To 
our knowledge, no researchers have 
used behavior theory for an in-depth 
look at mothers’ choice of infant 
sleep position.
Second, as part of the SAFE survey, 
we collected information not only 
about usual sleep position chosen by 
the mother but also other positions 
the infants were placed to sleep. In 
this way, we extend our outcome 
variables beyond what has been 
done in previous national studies 
to examine intention and actual 
practice with regard to both the 
usual sleeping position and whether 
mothers chose to place their infants 
exclusively supine.
Therefore, our objectives in this 
current study were to, in a nationally 
representative sample, examine (1) 
the prevalence of both maternal 
intention regarding infant sleeping 
position and actual practice and (2) 
factors associated with their choices.
MEthODS
Sample
We used a 2-stage clustered 
design for obtaining a nationally 
representative sample of mothers 
of infants aged 2 to 6 months. In 
addition, to ensure an adequate 
sample size for making comparisons 
across racial and/or ethnic groups, 
we oversampled for Hispanic and 
non-Hispanic African American 
mothers. The first stage sampled 
32 hospitals with at least 100 
births reported in the past year by 
utilizing the 2010 American Hospital 
Association annual survey. Among 
the 32 hospitals initially selected, 
69% agreed to participate; sampling 
procedures were used to identify 
replacement hospitals within the 
same stratum, which were based on 
location and population, to complete 
the full sample of 32 hospitals. 
Institutional review board approval 
was obtained at all participating 
institutions.
For the second stage, sampled 
hospitals were assigned targets for 
sampling and enrollment of Hispanic, 
non-Hispanic African American, and 
non-Hispanic other race mothers 
so that ∼3000 completed follow-up 
surveys were obtained from mothers 
of infants aged 2 to 6 months, 
including at least 25% of the surveys

Downloaded from 
 each from Hispanic and non-Hispanic 
African American mothers. Mothers 
were enrolled between January 
2011 and March 2014. Mothers 
were eligible for enrollment if they 
spoke English or Spanish, lived in the 
United States, and would be caring 
for their infants 2 to 4 months after 
delivery.
Measures
At the time of enrollment, mothers 
who provided written informed 
consent completed an initial survey 
to collect demographics, including 
the mother’s age, education, and 
income level; pregnancy and delivery 
history including infant sex, birth 
weight, and maternal parity; and 
contact information for completing 
the follow-up survey either online 
or by telephone. Mothers completed 
the survey when their infants were 
>60 days old. After that point, they 
received weekly reminders until 
180 days of age, after which time 
no additional reminders were sent. 
Mothers were allowed to complete 
the survey after this time and all 
adjusted analyses included infant 
age. Only 90 mothers completed the 
survey after 180 days, and the oldest 
infant was 227 days old at the time of 
completion of the survey.
The follow-up survey included 
questions about infant care practices, 
including information about intention 
and actual practice. Following 
the framework from the theory 
of planned behavior, there were 
also questions to assess maternal 
attitudes, subjective social norms, 
and perceived control.
About actual practice, mothers were 
asked: “Over the last 2 weeks, in 
what position have you USUALLY 
placed your baby to sleep?” Choices 
included: side, stomach, or back.
Mothers were also asked to choose 
all ways the infants were placed to 
sleep with the following statement: 
“Please CHECK ALL the ways that you 
have placed your baby to sleep over 
the last 2 weeks.” Choices included 
side, stomach, back, or other (which 
then required an explanation).
About doctor advice, mothers were 
first asked whether their infant’s 
doctor (or health care provider) 
gave advice about sleep positions 
(yes or no). Those who received 
advice from a doctor were then 
given 3 statements: “My baby’s 
doctor (or healthcare provider) 
thinks that I should place my baby 
to sleep on the side/stomach/back.” 
Agreement with each statement 
was given on a 7 point Likert scale 
(from definitely false to definitely 
true), with responses of 5, 6, and 7 
categorized as the doctor endorsing 
a sleep position. On the basis of these 
questions, the doctor’s advice was 
categorized as no advice, advice 
consistent with recommendations 
(endorsing back sleep and not 
endorsing side or prone sleep), 
or advice not consistent with 
recommendations (not endorsing 
back sleep or endorsing side or prone 
sleep in addition to back sleep).
The following questions about 
intention, attitudes, subjective social 
norms, and perceived control were 
all asked by using a Likert scale from 
1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly 
agree).
About intention, mothers were 
asked to respond to the following 
statement: “Now, over the next 
2 weeks, I plan to place my baby 
on the: side, stomach or back to 
sleep.” Responses of 5, 6, and 7 were 
categorized as intending to place 
their infant in that position. Mothers 
could intend to place their infant in 
>1 position.
About attitudes toward various sleep 
positions, mothers were asked to 
rate whether placing their infant on 
the back, side, or stomach would: “be 
healthy for my baby, be pleasant for 
my baby, be good for my baby, make 
my baby safer, make my baby more 
comfortable, keep my baby from 
choking.” For each set of questions, 
the average response was calculated, 
and if the average response was >4, 
then the mother was categorized as 
having a positive attitude toward that 
sleep position.
About subjective social norms, 
mothers were asked to respond to 
the following: “The people who are 
most important to me think that I 
should place my baby to sleep on the 
(Side, Back, Stomach).” Responses 
of 5, 6, and 7 were categorized as 
perceived positive social norms.
About perceived control, mothers 
were asked to respond to the 
following: “How I place my baby to 
sleep is mostly up to me.” Responses 
of 5, 6, and 7 were categorized as 
having perceived control.
Statistical Analysis
In all analyses, we accounted for 
the stratified 2-stage cluster sample 
design for both parameter estimates 
and SEs by using SAS (SAS 9.3; SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary NC) procedures 
for complex survey designs. Data 
were weighted to account for 
sampling probabilities and dropout 
and to reflect the national joint 
distributions of maternal age and 
race and/or ethnicity. As a check 
on the representativeness of our 
sample, weighted demographics 
were compared with the national 
demographics of mothers delivering 
between 2011 and 2013 by using 
National Center for Health Statistics 
data (Table 1).9
To describe the prevalence of 
sleep position practices, weighted 
percentages are given for all sleep 
positions reported by usual sleep 
position. To describe the association 
between sleep positions over the past 
2 weeks and intended sleep position 
over the next 2 weeks, weighted 
percentages of all positions are 
reported by intended position.
To examine the degree of adherence 
to AAP recommendations for 
exclusively supine sleep, we divided 
mothers into 4 distinct and relatively

 large groups. We chose these groups 
because it allowed us to look at 
differences between mothers who 
intended and practiced the gold 
standard (intended and practiced 
supine) compared with those who 
did not. On the basis of a review of 
the data, we defined 4 distinct and 
relatively large groups in this regard. 
Group 1 is mothers who reported 
that they intended to place their 
infants to sleep only supine and 
always used this position in practice 
(Intend Only Supine, Practice Only 
Supine). Group 2 is those mothers 
who reported that they intended to 
place their infants only supine but 
in practice placed their infants in a 
position other than supine at least 
some of the time (Intend Only Supine, 
Practice Other). This group intended 
to follow the gold standard but did 
not do it. Group 3 is those mothers 
who reported that they intended to 
place their infant on the side or side 
and back (Intend Side or Side and 
Back). Group 4 is those mothers who 
included at least some prone sleeping 
as an intended position (Intend 
Includes Prone). Groups 3 and 4 
were chosen because they did not 
intend to follow the gold standard. 
Multivariable multinomial logistic 
regression was used to examine 
associations between demographic 
factors, doctor advice, attitudes, 
subjective social norms, perceived 
control, and the 4 groups listed 
above.
RESULtS
Study Population
Of the 6508 mothers who met the 
sampling criteria, 6011 (92%) were 
eligible (Fig 1). Of those eligible, 
5354 (89%) were approached. 
Of those approached, 3983 
(74%) enrolled, and 3297 (83%) 
completed the survey. The reason 
for not approaching a mother 
was almost always related to staff 
availability. Mothers who were 
not approached did not differ from 
those who were approached with 
regards to either maternal age or 
maternal race and/or ethnicity, 
the only variables available from 
the study logs. After weighting and 
adjustment for cluster sampling, 
our sample demographic closely 
matched data from the National 
Center for Health Statistics from 
2011 to 2013, 
9 except that in 
our sample, women with less 
than high school education were 
underrepresented (12.8% vs 
17.1%) as were infants of low birth 
weight (5.7% vs 8.0%) (Table 1).
Prevalence of Sleep Position 
Practices
In Table 2, we show weighted 
percentages for the practice the 
mothers reported using during the 
past 2 weeks. We show both usual 
practice and the practice used at 
least once. Of those surveyed, 2491 
(77.3%) reported that they usually 
placed their infants supine for 
sleep, 14.1% side, and 7.8% prone. 
However, only 49.2% of mothers

exclusively in the supine position.
Intention Versus Actual Practice
In Table 3, we show weighted 
percentages for the sleep position(s) 
mothers intended to use and their 
actual practice (any position used over 
the past 2 weeks). Of the respondents, 
57.6% reported that they intended 
to place their infants only in supine 
position; however, in actual practice, 
only 43.7% of mothers reported 
intention and in actual practice 
followed the gold standard of placing 
their infants only in the supine position 
for sleep. Another relatively large 
group was the 26.1% (21.9% + 4.2%) 
of mothers who did not intend only 
supine (the gold standard) but rather 
intended to place their infants in 
the side or side and supine position. 
Finally, a smaller but important group 
was the 14.9% (2.5% + 1.9% + 8.1% + 
2.4%) of mothers who intended some 
use of the prone position for placing 
their infants to sleep.

 Factors Associated With Intention 
and Practice
In Table 4, we show factors 
associated with the 4 intention and 
practice categories identified above:
1. maternal intention to place the 
infant only supine and actual 
practice of only supine position 
(Intend Only Supine, Practice Only 
Supine);
2. maternal intention to place the 
infant only supine but actual 
practice is not only supine (intend 
only Supine, practice other);
3. maternal intention to place the 
infant on the side or side and 
supine (Intend Side or Side and 
Supine); and
4. maternal intention includes at 
least some prone as an intended 
position (Intend Includes Prone).
This multivariable analysis is shown 
in Table 4 and is adjusted for all 
variables in Table 4, including marital 
status and infant sex, age, and birth 
weight categories. All adjusted odds 
ratios (aORs) compare the indicated 
intention and practice to the gold 
standard (Intend Only Supine, 
Practice Supine). Of particular note, 
compared with white mothers, 
African American mothers were 
significantly more likely to intend 
to place their infants in the prone 
position at least some of the time 
(aOR 2.5; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.57–3.85). Compared with 
those who did, those who did 
not complete high school were 
significantly more likely to intend to 
place their infants prone (aOR 2.1; 
95% CI, 1.16–3.73).
Regarding receiving advice from a 
doctor compared with those who 
did not receive advice about sleep 
position from a doctor, those who 
received advice consistent with 
recommendations were less likely 
to report placement of their infants 
prone (aOR 0.6; 95% CI, 0.39–0.93) 
or side (aOR 0.5; 95% CI, 0.36–0.67),

 advice that was not consistent with 
recommendations were more likely 
to report placement of their infants 
prone (aOR 2.6; 95% CI, 1.52–4.47) 
or side (aOR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.07–3.32).
Examining the theory of planned 
behavior variables, we found that 
mothers who reported that the 
placement of their infant was not up 
to them (perceived control) were 
more likely to intend to place their 
infants in the prone position (aOR 
3.5; 95% CI, 1.70–7.25). Of all the 
variables, subjective social norms 
and attitudes were most strongly 
associated with behaviors. Of 
particular note, those who reported 
that their social norms supported 
placing the infant in the prone 
position were much more likely to 
do so compared with those who felt 
that their social norms supported 
using only the supine position (aOR 
11.6; 95% CI, 7.24–18.7). And, 
most remarkably, those who had 
positive attitudes about the prone 
sleep position (ie, agreed with the 
statements that putting the infant in 
the prone position for sleep would 
be healthy for the infant, be pleasant 
for the infant, be good for the infant, 
make the infant safer, make the 
infant more comfortable, and/or 
keep the infant from choking) were 
much more likely to choose the 
prone position (aOR 130; 95% CI, 
71.8–236).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative 
sample of mothers of infants, we 
found (as in our previous work) that 
∼70% of the participants reported 
usually placing their infants in 
the supine position for sleep.4 In 
this study, we expanded on that 
finding by examining other sleeping 
positions and found that fewer 
than half chose the supine position 
exclusively. Position changes are 
of particular concern given studies 
revealing that infants who are 
unaccustomed to prone sleeping are 
especially at risk when placed in that 
position and that those placed to 
sleep on their sides can easily roll to 
the prone position.10
In addition, we found that the 
intention to place infants exclusively 
in the supine position does not 
always reflect what is done 
in practice. Only just <44% of 
mothers practiced what would be 
considered the gold standard, which 
is the intention to place the infant 
in the supine position for sleep and 
following that intention exclusively 
in actual practice. These results may 
not be surprising given our previous 
qualitative work, which showed 
that although many caregivers 
are aware that infants should be 
placed supine for sleep, they are not 
always able to do so for a variety of 
reasons, including concerns about 
infant comfort, choking, and general 
safety.11 Our findings are similar to 
those of other researchers related 
to intention versus practice.7 To our 
knowledge, ours is the first to show 
the difference between intention 
and practice with choice of infant 
sleeping position.
In the multiple logistic regression 
analysis, we found that compared 
with white mothers, African 
American mothers were significantly 
more likely to intend to place their 
infants in a position other than 
supine, expanding on our previous 
work, which showed similar results 
for usual sleep position.4 In addition, 
those with less than a high school 
education were more likely to 
intend to use the prone position 
for sleep. As in our previous work, 
we also found that the advice from 
a doctor influenced choice.4 Those 
who reported receiving advice 
from a doctor consistent with AAP 
recommendations were less likely 
to intend to place their infants in the 
prone or side positions.
The factors most strongly associated 
with sleep position were those from 
the theory of planned behavior 
highlighting that the mothers’ 
perception of control, subjective 
social norms, and attitudes impacted 
both intention and usual practice. 
Mothers who believed the choice of 
infant sleeping position was not in 
their control had >3 times the odds 
of including prone sleep in their 
intended practice. It is possible this 
may relate to the influence of other 
caretakers such as grandmothers or 
day care providers who are known to 
choose other than the supine position 
for sleep.12 
– 
14
Those who had positive attitudes 
toward the prone position had >100 
times the odds of intending to use 
that position. Positive attitudes 
were determined by the answers 
to questions about infant safety, 
comfort, and choking. This finding 
supports findings from previous 
studies in which we found that 
these beliefs were important in 
determining choice of infant sleeping 
position.4 In addition, Gaydos et al15 
showed that concerns about safety 
and other cultural norms were 
important in parent decisions about 
infant sleep. These beliefs persist and 
are potentially modifiable, so they 
should be considered an important 
part of any intervention to change 
practice.
Although the results of the study 
expand on the current understanding 
of the choice to place an infant in the 
supine position for sleep, several 
limitations should be acknowledged. 
First, the data come from maternal 
reports, which can be biased toward 
the desired response. It is reassuring 
that some of the results, such as usual 
supine sleep position, are similar to 
those found in previous studies.4 In 
addition, in the case of such a bias, we 
might be underestimating the use of 
unsafe sleep practices. Also, although 
this sample is strikingly close to 
nationally representative numbers 
on the basis of the National Center 
for Health Statistics, 
9 it does slightly 
underrepresent low birth weight 
infants and those mothers with less 
than a high school education. Finally,

 it is also important to recognize that 
although the intention to place an 
infant in the supine position for sleep 
and then actually placing that infant 
in that position is the gold standard 
for sleep position, it does not mean 
that all AAP infant care practice 
recommendations were being 
followed.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we demonstrate that 
it is still common for infants to be 
placed in unsafe sleep positions, and 
the use of unsafe sleeping positions 
increases when expanded beyond 
the usual choice. Mothers may intend 
to follow recommendations, but 
some do not follow through with 
these intentions. Maternal race and 
education continue to be factors 
associated with choice of infant 
sleeping position as does advice from 
a doctor. Factors that appear to be 
of equal or greater importance are 
those related to attitudes, subjective 
social norms, and perceived control, 
all of which can potentially be altered 
through educational interventions. 
Future research can be aimed at 
using these findings to inform 
and then to test the efficacy of 
educational interventions to change 
practice.
