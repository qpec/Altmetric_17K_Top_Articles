IMPORTANCE Chronic respiratory diseases are an important cause of death and disability
in the United States.
OBJECTIVE To estimate age-standardized mortality rates by county from chronic
respiratory diseases.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Validated small area estimation models were applied to
deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics and population
counts from the US Census Bureau, National Center for Health Statistics, and Human
Mortality Database to estimate county-level mortality rates from 1980 to 2014 for chronic
respiratory diseases.
EXPOSURE County of residence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age-standardized mortality rates by county, year, sex,
and cause.
RESULTS A total of 4 616 711 deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases were recorded in the
United States from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2014. Nationally, the mortality rate
from chronic respiratory diseases increased from 40.8 (95% uncertainty interval [UI],
39.8-41.8) deaths per 100 000 population in 1980 to a peak of 55.4 (95% UI, 54.1-56.5)
deaths per 100 000 population in 2002 and then declined to 52.9 (95% UI, 51.6-54.4)
deaths per 100 000 population in 2014. This overall 29.7% (95% UI, 25.5%-33.8%) increase
in chronic respiratory disease mortality from 1980 to 2014 reflected increases in the mortality
rate from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (by 30.8% [95% UI, 25.2%-39.0%], from
34.5 [95% UI, 33.0-35.5] to 45.1 [95% UI, 43.7-46.9] deaths per 100 000 population),
interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis (by 100.5% [95% UI, 5.8%-155.2%], from
2.7 [95% UI, 2.3-4.2] to 5.5 [95% UI, 3.5-6.1] deaths per 100 000 population), and all other
chronic respiratory diseases (by 42.3% [95% UI, 32.4%-63.8%], from 0.51 [95% UI,
0.48-0.54] to 0.73 [95% UI, 0.69-0.78] deaths per 100 000 population). There were
substantial differences in mortality rates and changes in mortality rates over time among
counties, and geographic patterns differed by cause. Counties with the highest mortality
rates were found primarily in central Appalachia for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and pneumoconiosis; widely dispersed throughout the Southwest, northern Great Plains,
New England, and South Atlantic for interstitial lung disease; along the southern half of the
Mississippi River and in Georgia and South Carolina for asthma; and in southern states from
Mississippi to South Carolina for other chronic respiratory diseases.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite recent declines in mortality from chronic respiratory
diseases, mortality rates in 2014 remained significantly higher than in 1980. Between 1980
and 2014, there were important differences in mortality rates and changes in mortality by
county, sex, and particular chronic respiratory disease type. These estimates may be helpful
for informing efforts to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Costs due to chronic respiratory diseases increased by 3.7% per
year between 1996 and 2013, resulting in an estimated $132 bil-
lion in personal health expenditures in 2013.3
Significant variation in levels and trends in mortality rates
due to chronic respiratory diseases among states has previ-
ously been documented.4-6 More geographically granular in-
formation on temporal trends in mortality rates from chronic
respiratorydiseasesisnotwidelyavailable,butpreviousanaly-
ses of levels of COPD mortality at the county and health ser-
vice area level have found substantial variation even within
state borders.7-9 Moreover, analyses of chronic respiratory dis-
ease prevalence and hospitalizations have also found signifi-
cant variation both across and within states.10,11 Geographi-
cally precise annual estimates of chronic respiratory disease
mortality by type would facilitate a more complete under-
standing of regional and temporal variation in chronic respi-
ratory disease mortality rates and may be useful for clinicians
and policy makers interested in reducing geographic dispari-
ties and the health and financial burdens of chronic respira-
tory diseases overall.
Methods
The methods used for this analysis were previously re-
ported in detail elsewhere and are described briefly here.12
This research received institutional review board approval
from the University of Washington. Informed consent was
not required because the study used deidentified data and
was retrospective.
Data
This analysis used deidentified death records from the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics13 and population counts
from the US Census Bureau,14 National Center for Health
Statistics,15-17 and Human Mortality Database.18 Deaths
and population in the United States from January 1, 1980,
through December 31, 2014, were tabulated by county, age
group(0,1-4,5-9,…,75-79,and≥80years),sex,year,andcause.
County-level information on levels of education, income,
race/ethnicity, Native American reservations, and popula-
tion density derived from data provided by the US Census
Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics was also
used (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Where needed, counties
were combined to ensure historically stable units of analysis
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Cause List and Garbage Code Redistribution
This study used the cause list developed for the Global Bur-
den of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD).1 This
cause list is arranged hierarchically in 4 levels; within each
level, the list is exhaustive and mutually exclusive. eTable 3
in the Supplement lists all causes in the GBD cause list and the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes that correspond to each
cause. The focus of this study was on chronic respiratory dis-
eases, specifically chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in-
terstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis, asthma,
pneumoconiosis(furthersubdividedintoasbestosis,coalwork-
ers’pneumoconiosis,silicosis,andotherpneumoconiosis),and
the combination of all other respiratory diseases. Although the
focus of this study was chronic respiratory diseases, all causes
of death in the GBD cause list were analyzed concurrently.
Previous studies have identified “garbage codes” used in
death registration data, that is, insufficiently specific or im-
plausible cause-of-death codes. The use of these codes may
vary over time and place, resulting in misleading geographic
and temporal patterns.19 Algorithms developed for the GBD
were used to reallocate deaths assigned one of these garbage
codes to plausible alternatives.1 First, plausible target causes
were assigned to each garbage code or group of garbage codes.
Second, deaths were reassigned to specified target codes ac-
cording to proportions derived in 1 of 4 ways: (1) published lit-
erature or expert opinion; (2) regression models; (3) accord-
ing to the proportions initially observed among targets; and
(4) for HIV/AIDS specifically, by comparison with years be-
fore HIV/AIDS became widespread.
Statistical Analysis
Bayesian spatially explicit mixed-effects regression models
were estimated for each cause in the GBD hierarchy, sepa-
rately for males and females. The model for each cause was
specified as the following:
Dj,t,a � Poisson(mj,t,a ·Pj,t,a)
log(mj,t,a) = β0 + β1 ·Xj,t + γ1,a,t + γ2,j + (γ3,j ·t + γ4,j,t) +
(γ5,j ·a + γ6,j,a)
where Dj,t,a, Pj,t,a, and mj,t,a are the number of deaths,
the population, and the underlying mortality rate, respec-
tively, for county j, year t, and age group a. The model for
mj,t,a contained 6 components: an intercept (β0), fixed
covariate effects (β1), random age-time effects (γ1,a,t), ran-
dom spatial effects (γ2,j), random space-time effects (γ3,j and
γ4,j,t), and random space-age effects (γ5,j and γ6,j,a).
Key Points
Question What are the spatial and temporal trends in chronic
respiratory disease mortality among US counties from 1980
to 2014?
Findings Mortality rates due to chronic respiratory diseases
varied substantially among counties in all years. Between 1980
and 2014, chronic respiratory disease mortality increased by
29.7% (95% uncertainty interval, 25.5%-33.8%) overall, but this
trend varied by county, sex, and chronic respiratory disease type.
Meaning Between 1980 and 2014, there were important
differences in chronic respiratory disease mortality
among US counties.

 The model incorporated 7 covariates (Xj,t): the proportion of
the adult population who graduated high school, the pro-
portion of the population that is Hispanic, the proportion of
the population that is black, the proportion of the popula-
tion that is a race other than black or white, the proportion
of a county that is contained within a state or federal Native
American reservation, the median household income, and
the population density. γ1, γ2, γ3, and γ5 were assumed to
follow conditional autoregressive distributions, which allow
for smoothing over adjacent age groups and years (γ1) or
counties (γ2, γ3, and γ5).20,21 γ4 and γ6 were assumed to fol-
low independent mean-zero normal distributions.
Models were fit using the Template Model Builder
Package22 in R version 3.2.4 statistical software (R Founda-
tion for Statistical Computing). One thousand draws of mj,t,a
were taken from the posterior distribution. These draws were
raked23 (ie, scaled along multiple dimensions) to ensure con-
sistency between levels of the cause hierarchy and to ensure
consistency with national estimates from the GBD.1 Mortality
rates for both sexes combined were calculated from the
population-weighted average of the sex-specific mortality
rates. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated using
the US 2010 census population as the standard. Years of life
lost (YLLs) were calculated by multiplying the mortality rate
by population by age-specific life expectancy from the refer-
ence life table used in the GBD1 and then summing across all
ages. Point estimates were calculated from the mean of all
draws, and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated
from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Changes over time
were considered statistically significant if the posterior prob-
ability of an increase (or decrease) was at least 95%. No
explicit correction for multiple testing (ie, across multiple
counties) was applied; however, modeling all counties simul-
taneously is expected to mitigate the risk of spuriously
detecting changes due to multiple testing.
Results
Chronic Respiratory Diseases
Between 1980 and 2014, 4 616 711 deaths due to chronic
respiratory diseases were recorded in the United States.
Among all deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases, 9.4%
had been assigned garbage codes and were reassigned
via garbage code redistribution; at the county level, this
ranged from 0% to 58.5% (interquartile range, 8.1%-
12.6%) of deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases. In
2014, there were 177.3 (95% UI, 172.8-182.2) thousand
deaths (6.7% of all deaths) and 2522.2 (95% UI, 2466.8-
2582.7) thousand YLLs (5.5% of all YLLs) from chronic respi-
ratory diseases (Table). Within chronic respiratory diseases,
COPD accounted for the largest number of deaths in 2014

with a gap of 41.1 deaths per 100 000 population between
counties in the 10th and 90th percentiles in 2014. Nation-
ally, the mortality rate from chronic respiratory diseases

33.8%) increase in the national mortality rate between 1980
and 2014. During this same period, the mortality rate from
chronic respiratory diseases similarly increased in 93.2% of
counties (statistically significant in 88.3%), but changes
ranged from a 52.9% decline to a 224.0% increase. From
1980 to 2014, the difference between the mortality rate in
counties in the 90th and 10th percentiles nearly doubled,
increasing from 21.7 to 41.1 deaths per 100 000 population
(posterior probability of increase >99.9%).
Results for all chronic respiratory diseases by county and
year, including estimates for males and females separately, are
available in an online visualization tool.24
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
A total of 3 942 450 deaths due to COPD were recorded
in the United States between 1980 and 2014. Mortality rates
due to COPD varied widely among counties in 2014, ranging
from 9.9 to 152.3 deaths per 100 000 population, with a dif-
ference of 39.8 deaths per 100 000 population between coun-
ties in the 10th and 90th percentiles. Counties with the high-
est rates of COPD in 2014 were concentrated in central
Appalachia,butcouldalsobefoundinotherstatesinthesouth-
ern half of the United States as far west as Colorado (Figure 1).
CountieswiththelowestratesofCOPDin2014werefoundnear
Washington, DC; New York, New York; and San Francisco,
California; along the Texas-Mexico border; in central
Colorado; and in northern Utah.
Mortality from COPD increased between 1980 and
2014, with the mortality rate increasing 30.8% (95% UI,
25.2%-39.0%) overall from 34.5 (95% UI, 33.0-35.5) to 45.1
(95% UI, 43.7-46.9) deaths per 100 000 population. The
mortality rate similarly increased in a majority of counties
(91.9%; statistically significant in 86.1%) during this
period, but changes in the mortality rate nonetheless varied
widely among counties, ranging from a 60.5% decline to a
263.7% increase. Large increases were observed in counties
throughout the South, particularly in a band stretching
from northern Texas to North Carolina and South Carolina.
Counties where COPD declined were concentrated in the
Washington, DC, area, along the Texas-Mexico border,
along the Pacific coast in California, and in parts of Alaska,
Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana.
Temporal trends in COPD mortality rates differed con-
siderably between males and females (eFigure 2 and eFigure
3 in the Supplement). Nationally, COPD mortality rates
among males declined by 10.9% (95% UI, 3.9%-15.4%)
between 1980 and 2014, with most of this decline occurring
between 2000 and 2014. In contrast, national COPD mortal-
ity rates among females increased by 107.4% (95% UI,
92.1%-125.2%) between 1980 and 2014, with most of the
increase occurring prior to 2003 and relatively steady rates
from 2003 to 2014. At the county level between 1980 and
2014, COPD mortality among males declined in 40.7% of
counties (statistically significant in 23.6%), whereas COPD
mortality among females increased in most counties
(98.9%; statistically significant in 97.4%).
Interstitial Lung Disease and Pulmonary Sarcoidosis
Between 1980 and 2014, 403 168 deaths due to interstitial
lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis were recorded in
the United States. In 2014, mortality rates from interstitial
lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis varied among
counties, ranging from 2.7 to 14.9 deaths per 100 000 popu-
lation and with a gap of 2.6 deaths per 100 000 population
between counties in the 10th and 90th percentiles. Counties
with very high mortality rates relative to other counties
were dispersed throughout several regions, including the
Southwest, northern Great Plains, New England, and South
Atlantic (Figure 2). Counties with very low mortality rates
relative to other counties were also found in many parts of
the United States, including parts of Nevada, Colorado,
Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Florida.
The mortality rate from interstitial lung disease and pul-
monary sarcoidosis increased nationally by 100.5% (95% UI,
5.8%-155.2%), from 2.7 (95% UI, 2.3-4.2) deaths per 100 000
population in 1980 to 5.5 (95% UI, 3.5-6.1) deaths per
100 000 population in 2014. The mortality rate likewise
increased in nearly every county (statistically significant in
86.1% of counties) during this period. Counties with the
largest increases in mortality during this period were
located primarily in New England, whereas counties with
the smallest increases were found chiefly in Alaska, Nevada,
southern Florida, and near the US-Mexico border.
Asthma
A total of 157 066 deaths due to asthma were recorded in
the United States between 1980 and 2014. In 2014, mortal-
ity rates due to asthma ranged from 0.5 to 4.1 deaths per
100 000 population, and the difference between counties in
the 10th and 90th percentiles was 0.8 death per 100 000
population. The counties with the highest mortality rates
from asthma were located along the southern half of the
Mississippi River and in Georgia and South Carolina
(Figure 3).
The asthma mortality rate declined by 46.5% (95% UI,
27.0%-51.8%) between 1980 and 2014, from 2.2 (95% UI, 2.0-
2.3) to 1.2 (95% UI, 1.1-1.3) deaths per 100 000 population.
The mortality rate similarly declined in nearly every county

 (99.6%; statistically significant in 92.1%) during this period.
However, changes in the mortality rate still varied widely
among counties, ranging from a 15.3% increase to a 75.5% de-
cline. Counties with the largest declines were located primar-
ily in western and southwestern states, particularly southern
Arizona, northern New Mexico, central Colorado, and west-
ern Montana. Counties with the smallest declines (or even
increases) were found in the same regions with elevated mor-
tality in 2014.
Pneumoconiosis
Between 1980 and 2014, 57 033 deaths due to pneumoconio-
sis were recorded in the United States. These included 15 163
deaths due to asbestosis, 21 592 due to coal workers’pneu-
moconiosis, 4529 due to silicosis, and 15 749 due to other
pneumoconiosis. Large differences in the mortality rate
were observed among counties, with mortality rates rang-
ing from 0.1 to 43.5 deaths per 100 000 population in 2014.
Most counties had very low pneumoconiosis mortality

 rates: 91.0% of counties experience mortality rates of
less than 1 death per 100 000 in 2014. A small subset of
counties experienced substantially higher mortality rates
from pneumoconiosis; these counties were concentrated in
central Appalachia, but there were also individual counties
with relatively high pneumoconiosis mortality rates in
Mississippi, Colorado, Utah, and Montana (Figure 4).
Among 1530 deaths due to pneumoconiosis in 2014,
38.0% (582 [95% UI, 493-648]) were due to asbestosis,
17.4% (266 [95% UI, 229-349]) were due to coal workers’
pneumoconiosis, 4.8% (74 [95% UI, 62-105]) were due to
silicosis, and 39.7% (608 [95% UI, 552-734]) were due to
other pneumoconiosis. As with pneumoconiosis overall,
most counties had very low mortality rates from asbestosis,
coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, and silicosis, whereas a
small subset of counties experienced substantially elevated
mortality rates (Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7). In con-
trast, the mortality rates due to other pneumoconiosis were
low (<0.7 death per 100 000 population) in all counties in
2014 (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
The mortality rate from pneumoconiosis declined by
48.5% (95% UI, 38.7%-53.7%) overall between 1980 and

due to a decrease in coal workers’pneumoconiosis, which
declined 85.0% (95% UI, 79.8%-87.4%), and silicosis,
which declined 80.1% (95% UI, 70.7%-83.7%); in contrast,

Other Chronic Respiratory Diseases
A total of 56 994 deaths due to other chronic respiratory dis-
eases were recorded in the United States between 1980
and 2014. The mortality rate due to other chronic res-
piratory diseases was generally low but still varied among
counties, ranging from 0.3 to 2.2 deaths per 100 000 popu-
lation in 2014. Mortality rates from this group of diseases
were generally highest in southern counties stretching
from Mississippi to South Carolina, and were also elevated
in counties in northern Maine and western counties stretch-
ing from Wyoming and Utah to California and Oregon
(Figure 8). Mortality rates from other chronic respiratory
diseases were lowest in counties near New York City and in
southern Florida and California.

 Between 1980 and 2014, the mortality rate from other
chronic respiratory diseases increased by 42.3% (95% UI,
32.4%-63.8%) nationally, from 0.51 (95% UI, 0.48-0.54)
to 0.73 (95% UI, 0.69-0.78) death per 100 000 population. The
mortality rate from other chronic respiratory diseases simi-
larly increased in most counties (99.6%; statistically signifi-
cant in 94.5%) during this period, although the magnitude of
change was variable. The counties with the largest increases
in chronic respiratory disease mortality were found predomi-
nantly in western Oregon and northwestern California, south-
ern Idaho and northern Utah, and northern Maine.
Discussion
Between 1980 and 2014, the mortality rate due to chronic
respiratory diseases increased nationally. However, the
results of this analysis show that this national trend does not
demonstrate the significant diversity among counties,
among different types of chronic respiratory diseases, and
between males and females. This analysis expands the
amount of information available on chronic respiratory dis-
eases at local levels in several important ways and provides

needed information to address the burden of chronic respi-
ratory diseases in their communities.
This study confirmed earlier reports9 of large variation
among counties in mortality rates from COPD and also
revealed substantial variation among counties in mortality
rates from other chronic respiratory diseases. Additionally,
this study found markedly different geographic patterns for
different chronic respiratory diseases: counties with the
highest mortality rates were found primarily in central
Appalachia for COPD and pneumoconiosis; along the south-
ern half of the Mississippi River and in Georgia and South
Carolina for asthma; widely dispersed throughout the South-
west, northern Great Plains, New England, and South Atlantic
for interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis; and
in southern states from Mississippi to South Carolina for
other chronic respiratory diseases.
This study is also the first, to our knowledge, to estimate
mortality rates on an annual basis during an extended period
for any chronic respiratory disease, enabling comparison

 diseases, there was considerable variation among counties in
the change in the mortality rate between 1980 and 2014; for
example,county-levelchangesinthemortalityratefromCOPD
ranged from a 60.5% decline to a 263.7% increase. Moreover,
for chronic respiratory diseases as a group, this study found
evidence of increasing geographic disparities during this same
period, with the gap between counties in the 10th and 90th
percentiles almost doubling between 1980 and 2014.
There are a number of potential explanations for the geo-
graphic and temporal variation documented in this study.
Nearly three-quarters (73.4%) of deaths due to chronic respi-
ratory disease in the United States have been attributed to
tobacco smoke, including 81.8% of deaths due to COPD.25
Smoking prevalence varies widely among counties and there
is considerable overlap between regions with high smoking
prevalence and regions with high chronic respiratory disease
mortality.26 Differences in COPD mortality trends between
males and females may also be partially attributed to histori-
cal trends in smoking: smoking prevalence and intensity
increased less rapidly among females compared with males
but peaked later, a pattern that is reflected in COPD mortality
rates decades later.27,28

 Occupational exposure to certain dusts has been impli-
cated as a risk factor for mortality from chronic respiratory
diseases, particularly pneumoconiosis.25 The long-term
declines in mortality rates due to silicosis and coal workers’
pneumoconiosis documented in this study have previously
been attributed to declines in exposure to silica and coal
dust, respectively, following establishment and enforce-
ment of exposure limits in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as
declining participation in occupations associated with ex-
posure.4,29 Although exposure to asbestos has also de-
clined, mortality rates increased during the period of our
analysis, likely due to the long lag between asbestos expo-
sure and onset of asbestosis.30 Much of the variation in mor-
tality rates due to pneumoconiosis among counties is likely
due to regional differences in industry; this can be seen par-
ticularly for coal workers’pneumoconiosis, with high mor-
tality rates concentrated in regions with coal mines. Differ-
ences in compliance with exposure limits, average job
tenure, and geology may further contribute to the variabil-
ity in mortality rates among counties.31
Air pollution is also a well-documented risk factor
for chronic respiratory disease mortality.25 County-level

may be partially mediated via chronic respiratory diseases.
County-level differences in diagnosis and treatment of
chronic respiratory diseases may also explain part of the
variation in chronic respiratory disease mortality docu-
mented in this study. Deaths due to COPD make up the
majority of deaths due to all chronic respiratory diseases in
the United States, and appropriate treatment can often pro-
long and improve quality of life among individuals with
COPD.33 Previous research has suggested that many individu-
als with COPD are undiagnosed34 and that recommended
treatments are underused even among individuals who have
been diagnosed.35 Although county-level information on
rates of diagnosis and treatment of COPD and other chronic
respiratory diseases is unavailable, large differences have
been documented for other chronic conditions,36,37 suggest-
ing that similar differences may exist with respect to chronic
respiratory diseases.
This analysis has several important limitations. First,
this analysis made use of population, deaths, and covariates
data from a number of different sources, all of which are

 subject to error. Second, 2 different versions of the ICD were
in use during the period considered, and changes to cause-
of-death coding corresponding to changes in the ICD may
lead to spurious trends, although we have attempted to
mitigate the effects of this change by using a consistent
mapping of ICD codes to chronic respiratory disease causes.
Third, this analysis used garbage code redistribution algo-
rithms to redistribute deaths assigned implausible or non-
specific causes to likely true causes of death; however,
these methods have not been validated because appropriate
gold-standard data are unavailable. Fourth, the uncertainty
that arises from applying these garbage code redistribution
algorithms is difficult to quantify and consequently has not
been accounted for in the UIs associated with all estimated
mortality rates. Fifth, this analysis used small area estima-
tion models that smooth mortality rates over time, space,
and age groups, which may in some cases attenuate unusu-
ally low or high mortality rates and underestimate true geo-
graphic variability.
Chronic respiratory diseases are a leading cause of
death in the United States and are associated with significant
morbidity and financial costs. Chronic respiratory disease
mortality has previously been linked with a number of
exposures—smoking, occupational exposures, air pollution—
that are potentially amenable to intervention. Moreover, for
some chronic respiratory diseases, treatments exist that can
improve quality of life and prevent or delay death, under-
scoring the importance of promoting prompt diagnosis and
utilization of recommended treatments. The local informa-
tion on chronic respiratory disease mortality from this study
should be used to galvanize support for action and to better
target and customize efforts to reduce the burden of chronic
respiratory diseases.
Conclusions
Despite recent declines in mortality from chronic respiratory
diseases, mortality rates in 2014 remained significantly higher
than in 1980. Between 1980 and 2014, there were important
differences in mortality rates and changes in mortality by
county, sex, and particular chronic respiratory disease type.
These estimates may be helpful for informing efforts to im-
prove prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
