Abstract
We directly assessed mesial temporal activity in two Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients without a 
history or EEG evidence of seizures, using intracranial foramen ovale electrodes. We detected 
clinically silent hippocampal seizures and epileptiform spikes during sleep, a period when both 
were most likely to interfere with memory consolidation. These index cases support a model in 
which early development of occult hippocampal hyperexcitability may contribute to the 
pathogenesis of AD.
One century ago, microscopic analysis of brain tissue from a single patient, Auguste Deter, 
established a link between amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and severe memory 
loss1. Amyloid plaques were, in fact, first described by Blocq and Marinesco in 1892, in 
patients with epilepsy2. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and epilepsy both impair cognition and 
manifest overlapping patterns of cellular neurodegeneration and hypometabolism in the 
temporal lobe3. Despite extraordinary advances in the molecular pathology of AD4, the 
structural basis for the early fluctuating course of cognitive decline in AD remains elusive 
and cannot be explained from purely microscopic or macroscopic pathological standpoints. 
Correlation of cognitive deficits with amyloid plaque load is weak5, comparable brain 
atrophy can be seen in cognitively normal adults6 and in non-dementing diseases (including 
epilepsy)7, and a fluctuating course is not easily explained by a monotonic process of

 progressive cell death. Interneurons are among the first to die in AD mesial temporal 
cortex8, however, and the ensuing degradation of synaptic connectivity and circuit 
remodeling could disrupt network oscillations that contribute to memory storage and 
retrieval. Intermittent temporal lobe dysrhythmia could therefore account for early 
fluctuations in cognition in AD patients. Here, we used intracranial electrodes inserted 
through the foramen ovale (FO) and positioned adjacent to the mesial temporal lobe (mTL)9 
to directly assess, for the first time, mTL activity in two patients with AD and fluctuating 
cognition.
The first patient examined was a 67 year-old woman with no seizure history who developed 
cognitive decline over one year, punctuated by confusional episodes described as hours of 
repetitive questioning and garbled speech that required days for full recovery. 
Neuropsychological testing demonstrated amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Additional 
clinical details are reported in the Supplementary Information.
Brain MRI showed diffuse atrophy, and 18FDG-PET demonstrated left temporoparietal 
hypometabolism (Supp. Figure 1a,b). A 35-minute scalp EEG obtained during sleep showed 
normal sleep architecture including spindles and K-complexes, and no evidence of focal 
slowing or epileptiform discharges. CSF analysis showed an amyloid-tau index of 0.44 (<1.0 
abnormal) and a phosphorylated tau level of 95.9 pg/mL (>61 abnormal), consistent with a 
diagnosis of AD. Genetic testing revealed APOE3/4 alleles but no exome variants in three 
known familial AD genes (Supp. Figure 2). On continuous video-EEG monitoring, left 
temporal sharp waves were seen at a rate of ~2/hour during wakefulness and ~40–70/hour 
during sleep. Rare right temporal sharp waves also occurred during sleep (~5/hour). Based 
on a high index of suspicion for occult seizures, the patient was implanted with bilateral FO 
electrodes targeting the mTL (Figure 1a). Intracranial recordings from these electrodes 
revealed abundant mTL spiking (~400/hour during wakefulness and up to ~850/hour during 
sleep), with 85% of spikes arising from the left mTL. The majority (95%) of spikes detected 
on FO electrodes were not evident on scalp EEG (Figure 1b). During the first of 12 hours of 
recording, the patient had three subclinical seizures arising from the left mTL, all occurring 
during sleep (Figure 1c). Scalp EEG during these seizures showed no ictal activity. One 
seizure was associated with awakening from sleep, while the others had no overt clinical 
manifestations. The patient was treated with levetiracetam, a common anti-epileptic drug 
that has been shown to reduce abnormal spiking activity in animal models of AD10 and to 
reduce hippocampal hyperactivity in humans with amnestic mild cognitive impairment11. 
Levetiracetam binds to SV2A12, a synaptic vesicle protein that regulates neurotransmitter 
release, though the exact mechanism of levetiracetam’s anticonvulsant effect is unknown. 
After starting levetiracetam (1500mg/day), no further seizures were captured on FO 
electrodes over the following 48 hours prior to their removal, and spike frequency was 
reduced by 65%. Twelve months later, she reported one spell of confusion following several 
consecutively missed doses of levetiracetam. Repeat neuropsychological testing showed 
mild progression of her cognitive deficits.
The second patient included in this study was a 58 year-old woman with no seizure history, 
initially evaluated for gradual cognitive decline, including repetitive questioning, misplacing 
objects, and social withdrawal. Within 5 years, she had severe dementia (additional clinical

 details are reported in the Supplementary Information). Brain MRI demonstrated diffuse 
atrophy (Supp. Figure 1c), and CSF showed an amyloid-tau index of 0.26 (<1.0 abnormal) 
and a phosphorylated tau level of 73.2 pg/mL (>61 abnormal), consistent with a diagnosis of 
early onset AD. There was no reported history of early onset dementia in this family 
(although genetic analysis was not obtained). At age 63, dramatic fluctuations in anxiety 
prompted further evaluation. Continuous video-EEG monitoring demonstrated rare 
multifocal epileptiform discharges seen independently over the right temporal, left temporal, 
and bifrontal regions (~2/hour during wakefulness and ~12/hour during sleep). Bilateral FO 
electrode recordings demonstrated frequent right mTL spikes (~16/hour during wakefulness 
and up to ~190/hour during sleep). Similar to the first patient, over 95% of the spikes 
detected on FO electrodes were not evident on scalp EEG (Figure 1d). Those that were 
evident on scalp EEG resembled benign epileptiform transients of sleep, previously defined 
as a normal variant of no pathological significance13 (Figure 1e). A trial of levetiracetam 
(1000mg/day) was not tolerated due to worsening mood.
These two patients demonstrate that clinically silent mTL seizures and spikes can occur 
early in the course of AD, in the absence of significant scalp EEG abnormalities, and may 
predominate during sleep. Here, we validate a minimally invasive method to detect this 
activity using FO electrodes, which are safe, readily inserted percutaneously, and allow 
highly sensitive monitoring of mTL activity.9,14,15 The clinical utility of FO recordings in 
evaluating dementia patients is not yet known, though our FO recordings clearly 
demonstrate that scalp EEG findings greatly underestimate subcortical hyperexcitability in 
AD (Figure 2). All mTL seizures and over 95% of mTL spikes were not evident on scalp 
EEG. Additional studies of AD patients with FO recordings are needed to determine 
whether occult mTL epileptiform abnormalities are common or rare in AD and whether they 
define a hyperexcitable subtype of AD with specific treatment implications.
Our findings challenge the widely held view that epilepsy occurs only as a late sequela of 
neurodegeneration in AD, to be treated symptomatically once clinical seizures arise. 
Subclinical seizures and spikes can cause significant cognitive impairments16–18. Vossel and 
colleagues found subclinical scalp EEG and/or MEG epileptiform discharges in 42% of AD 
patients without a history of seizures, and patients with epileptiform discharges had a faster 
rate of cognitive decline19. In our patients, mTL seizures and spikes were activated during 
sleep, a period critical for memory consolidation, which may further increase their 
pathogenic impact20. Activation of spikes during sleep has been described in animal 
models21,22 and patients with AD19, and is common in focal epilepsies23. EEG recordings in 
the AD population should at minimum include sleep. When clinical seizures arise in AD, 
they are typically well-controlled with medication24,25, yet it remains unclear whether early 
detection and treatment of subclinical spikes and seizures can prevent or slow cognitive 
decline in AD. Elucidation of the cognitive impact of subclinical epileptiform activity on 
disease trajectory, and development of novel pharmacology to treat the specific 
hyperexcitability of the AD brain should be a critical priority.

Foramen ovale electrode placement
After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, consent for FO electrode placement 
was obtained from either the patient (Patient #1 had capacity to provide consent) or from the 
patient’s health care proxy (Patient #2). Placement of foramen ovale (FO) electrodes14 was 
performed in the operating room under sterile conditions, with the patient under general 
endotracheal anesthesia and positioned supine with neck extended and head turned away 
from the site of insertion. Prior to insertion, each cheek was prepped with chlorhexidine, and 
Lidocaine 1% was injected 2.5 cm lateral to the labial fissure. With the fluoroscope C-arm 
angled 45 degrees from vertical, the foramen ovale was visualized. A 16-gauge needle was 
initially used to pass through the skin, and a 10-gauge needle with stylet (Ad-Tech, Racine, 
WI) was advanced towards the foramen ovale under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle tip 
was placed approximately 2mm anterior to the clival line, and a lateral fluoroscopic image 
was taken to confirm the needle’s position. The stylet was then removed, and a four-contact 
FO electrode (Ad-Tech, Racine, WI) was advanced through the needle under fluoroscopic 
guidance so that all electrode contacts were positioned beyond the tip of the needle. A lateral 
fluoroscopic image was taken to confirm electrode position, and the needle was gently 
withdrawn. The electrode was sutured to the cheek with 0 silk sutures. The same procedure 
was repeated to place the FO electrode on the contralateral side. After placement of both FO 
electrodes, anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic images were taken to confirm final 
electrode position, and sterile dressings were placed over the electrode exit site on each 
cheek. The patient was awakened from general anesthesia and observed in the post-
anesthesia recovery room for 1 hour. A post-procedure CT head was obtained, and the 
patient was brought to the inpatient Epilepsy Monitoring Unit for further monitoring. While 
FO electrodes were in place, the patient remained on vancomycin and ceftriaxone 
antimicrobial prophylaxis. At the end of the investigation, prophylactic anticoagulation was 
held for 24 hours, and the FO electrodes were removed at the bedside.
Scalp EEG and FO electrode recordings
Scalp electrodes were placed using the International 10–20 system with anterior temporal 
electrodes (T1, T2). All recordings were acquired using XLTEK hardware (Natus Medical 
Inc., Pleasanton CA) with data sampled at 1024 Hz. Scalp EEG and FO electrode recordings 
were visually interpreted as per routine clinical practice. Spike quantification was performed 
manually on randomly sampled, 30–60 minute segments of uninterrupted awake or asleep 
states.
Cognitive testing
The Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration test26 and Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment27 were administered by physicians and/or other trained personnel during 
Memory Disorders Unit and/or Epilepsy Clinic visits. CDR scales were assessed at each 
Memory Disorders Unit visit.

 Laboratory testing
CSF amyloid and tau analysis was performed by Athena Diagnostics, Marlborough, MA 
(ADmark Alzheimer’s Evaluation).
Imaging
For patient #1, MRI brain images were obtained with and without gadolinium contrast, on a 
Siemens 3T Trio scanner, with the following sequences: sagittal FLAIR, sagittal T1, axial 
FLAIR, axial T2, coronal FLAIR, coronal T2, axial SWI, and axial DWI. 18FDG-PET 
images were obtained on a Siemens Biograph PET/CT scanner 45 minutes after injection 
with 5.5mCi of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. For patient #2, 3T MRI brain images were obtained 
without contrast, with the following sequences: sagittal FLAIR, sagittal T1, axial FLAIR, 
axial T2, coronal T1, axial GRE, and axial DWI. All scans were performed for clinical 
purposes and interpreted by staff neuroradiologists.
Genetic Analysis
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects undergoing genetic analysis. Five of six 
siblings of Patient #1 were enrolled in an IRB approved neurogenetics project at Baylor 
College of Medicine (H-13798) with informed consent. As described previously28, DNA 
extracted from peripheral blood samples was submitted for whole exome sequencing (Genet, 
Gaithersburg, MD). Sequencing produced more than 120× average depth of coverage per 
exome (median coverage = 115) per sample with >90% of the captured bases at >20× 
coverage depth. Raw sequencing reads were processed using the Codified (https://
www.scienceexchange.com/labs/codified-genomics) annotation platform29. Alleles with > 
20× coverage and 40% allele fraction were considered for further analysis. The Similarity 
score (the proportion of the rare variants with MAF <0.5 shared among siblings was as 
expected, averaging 46% and ranging between 42% and 49%. We identified on average 707 
total variants per exome (range 694–739) and an average of 131 variants per exome in 
known disease genes (range 124–138).
