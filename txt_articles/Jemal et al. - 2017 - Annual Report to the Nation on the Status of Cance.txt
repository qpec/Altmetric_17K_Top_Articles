Abstract
Background: The American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate to provide annual
updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States. This Annual Report highlights survival rates.
Methods: Data were from the CDC- and NCI-funded population-based cancer registry programs and compiled by NAACCR.
Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex were es-
timated by joinpoint analysis and expressed as annual percent change. We used relative survival ratios and adjusted relative
risk of death after a diagnosis of cancer (hazard ratios [HRs]) using Cox regression model to examine changes or differences in
survival over time and by sociodemographic factors.
Results: Overall cancer death rates from 2010 to 2014 decreased by 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ –1.8% to –1.8%) per
year in men, by 1.4% (95% CI ¼ –1.4% to –1.3%) per year in women, and by 1.6% (95% CI ¼ –2.0% to –1.3%) per year in children.
Death rates decreased for 11 of the 16 most common cancer types in men and for 13 of the 18 most common cancer types in
women, including lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate, whereas death rates increased for liver (men and women),
pancreas (men), brain (men), and uterine cancers. In contrast, overall incidence rates from 2009 to 2013 decreased by 2.3%
(95% CI ¼ –3.1% to –1.4%) per year in men but stabilized in women. For several but not all cancer types, survival
statistically significantly improved over time for both early and late-stage diseases. Between 1975 to 1977 and 2006 to
2012, for example, five-year relative survival for distant-stage disease statistically significantly increased from 18.7% (95%
CI ¼ 16.9% to 20.6%) to 33.6% (95% CI¼ 32.2% to 35.0%) for female breast cancer but not for liver cancer (from 1.1%, 95% CI¼ 0.3%
to 2.9%, to 2.3%, 95% CI¼ 1.6% to 3.2%). Survival varied by race/ethnicity and state. For example, the adjusted relative risk of
death for all cancers combined was 33% (HR¼ 1.33, 95% CI ¼ 1.32 to 1.34) higher in non-Hispanic blacks and 51% (HR ¼ 1.51, 95%
CI¼ 1.46 to 1.56) higher in non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives compared with non-Hispanic whites.
Conclusions: Cancer death rates continue to decrease in the United States. However, progress in reducing death rates and
improving survival is limited for several cancer types, underscoring the need for intensified efforts to discover new strategies
for prevention, early detection, and treatment and to apply proven preventive measures broadly and equitably.

Article
 The American Cancer Society (ACS), Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the
North
American
Association
of
Central
Cancer
Registries
(NAACCR) have collaborated annually since 1998 to provide up-
dates on cancer incidence and mortality patterns in the United
States (1–18). Each “Annual Report to the Nation” also features
an in-depth analysis of a selected topic, and this year’s report
features survival by stage, race/ethnicity, and state for common
cancers.
In addition to death and incidence rates, survival is an im-
portant measure for assessing progress in efforts to improve
cancer outcomes (19). As with most disease surveillance mea-
sures, the interpretation of survival trends is complicated by
changes in screening and detection practices (19,20). In particu-
lar, screening may lead to the detection of cases that would not
have been detected through clinical manifestation in a lifetime
(overdiagnosis) or the detection of cancers that are inherently
slow growing (length bias). Screening may also result in earlier
diagnosis without changing the date of death, generating appar-
ent improvements in survival without changing the actual
course of disease (lead time bias) (21). In this report, we examine
temporal changes in overall and stage-specific survival for all
races/ethnicities combined and in overall survival by race, and
contemporary overall survival by race and ethnicity and state of
residence. We interpret these survival statistics in the context
of changes in screening, early detection, and treatment.
Methods
Data Sources
Cancer Incidence Data
Population-based cancer incidence data by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity were obtained from 39 states and two metropolitan
area registries that participate in the CDC’s National Program of
Cancer
Registries
(NPCR)
and/or
the
NCI’s
Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The data satis-
fied NAACCR’s data quality criteria and represented cases diag-
nosed from 1999 through 2013, (22) covering 89% of the US
population. This database of 41 registries was used to derive all
incidence statistics presented in this report, which is the first
annual report that has drawn all incidence statistics from a sin-
gle database. In the past, limitations on the number of high-
quality registries extending back in time required estimation of
five-year average incidence rates from one set of registries, 10-
year trends from a smaller set, and long-term trends from a
third even smaller set.
Anatomic site and histology were coded according to the
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O)
edition in use at the time of diagnosis and were converted to
the third edition coding (23) and categorized according to SEER
site groups (24). Only cases defined as malignant under ICD-O-2
and ICD-O-3 were included in this report. For solid tumors, stage
was categorized as localized, regional, or distant using SEER
Summary Stage 2000, which has been used for new cases (inci-
dence) diagnosed in 1998 or later (25). All case counts were ad-
justed for delay in reporting or corrections (26).
Cancer Mortality Data
Cause of death by age, sex, and race/ethnicity (2000–2014) was
based on death certificate information reported to state vital
statistics offices and compiled into a national file for the entire
United States by the CDC National Center for Health Statistics’
(NCHS’) National Vital Statistics System (27). The underlying
causes of death were selected according to the International
Classification of Disease (ICD) codes and rules in use at the time
of death (ICD-8 through ICD-10) and categorized according to
SEER causes of death recode to maximize comparability be-
tween ICD and ICD-O versions (24).
Race/Ethnicity
Information on race and ethnicity was based on medical records
or death certificates. Race is categorized as white, black, Asian
and Pacific Islander (API), American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/
AN). Race by ethnicity according to Hispanic origin (race/ethnic-
ity)
was
categorized
as
non-Hispanic
white
(NHW),
non-
Hispanic black (NHB), non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islander
(NHAPI), non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (NHAI/
AN), and Hispanic. Race and race/ethnicity information for AI/
AN, however, is reliable only for geographic areas covered by
the Indian Health Service Contract Health Service Delivery
Areas (CHSDA) (10,28,29), and thus incidence, mortality, and
survival data for American Indians/Alaska Natives are based on
these areas. We present data by race and by Hispanic origin for
incidence and mortality. Incidence was presented by race and
ethnicity separately because delay adjustment factors were not
available for the combined race/ethnicity categorization. Cause-
specific survival and adjusted risk of cancer death are presented
by race/ethnicity; however, relative survival estimates are pre-
sented only for race categories where appropriate life tables
were available.
Population Data
The population estimates used as the denominators to calculate
incidence and death rates were a modification of the intercen-
sal and Vintage 2014 annual times series of July 1, county popu-
lation estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin produced
by the US Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Program, in
collaboration with CDC’s NCHS and with support from the NCI
(30). The estimates incorporate intercensal (for July 1, 2000–
2009) and Vintage 2014 (for July 1, 2010–2013) bridged single-
race estimates that are derived from the original multiple-race
categories in the 2000 and 2010 Censuses (as specified in the
1997 Office of Management and Budget standards for the collec-
tion of data on race and ethnicity) (31,32). For most states, popu-
lation estimates as of July 1 of each year were used to calculate
rates that were presumed to reflect the average population of a
defined geographic area for a calendar year; however, some ad-
justments were made to refine these estimates, as has been
done in previous reports (16,17,30).
Survival Data
To examine survival over time, by race, and by geographic
areas, we used survival data from three databases. We used sur-
vival data from 9-SEER cancer registries (covering about 10% of
the US population) to examine temporal changes in five-year
survival between patients diagnosed from 1975 to 1977 vs 2006
to 2012 and followed through 2013; 1975 was the first year when
all nine registries submitted incidence data to SEER. We exam-
ined these changes for the 20 most common cancers by race (all
races, whites, blacks) and by stage (all races combined only),
when stage information was available. We examined differ-
ences in contemporary survival for patients diagnosed from
2006 to 2012 by race/ethnicity (NHW, NHB, NHAPI, NHAI/AN,
and Hispanic) for the 20 most common cancers using survival
data from 18-SEER areas, which cover about 28% of the US

 population. We used 33 SEER or NPCR registries compiled by
NAACCR (covering 67% of the US population) to examine contem-
porary survival differences by state of residence for the four most
common cancers (lung, colon and rectum, female breast, prostate).
These 33 registries (31 states and two metropolitan areas, referred
to hereafter as “states”) were considered to have sufficient vital sta-
tus follow-up to conduct survival analyses because they either con-
ducted recent National Death Index (NDI) linkages or they routinely
conduct active vital status follow-up of all cases (33).
In all SEER-only-based survival analyses, only first primary
cancers were used in the analysis and patients were followed
for vital status through December 31, 2013. For the state-specific
analysis, which included data from the SEER and NPCR regis-
tries, the first site-specific cancer was used in the analysis be-
cause of the different starting dates among the registries (34)
and patients were followed for vital status through December
31, 2012, because not all registries had complete information on
vital status through December 31, 2013. In SEER registries, can-
cers that were identified by death certificate or autopsy only
were excluded, as were patients with no survival time.
Statistical Methods
Incidence and Death Rates and Trends
Cross-sectional incidence (2009–2013) and death (2010–2014)
rates for all ages combined were calculated for all cancer sites
combined and for the 15 most common cancer sites by sex, race,
and Hispanics. These rates were calculated with their 95% confi-
dence intervals using SEER*Stat software, version 8.3.2 (35,36).
Incidence rates were delay-adjusted to account for revisions to
the case counts in future submissions (http://surveillance.cancer.
gov/delay/). Similarly, we calculated overall incidence and death
rates for children (0–14 years). All rates were age-standardized to
the 2000 US Standard Population and were expressed per 100 000
persons (35). Rates based on fewer than 16 case subjects were
deemed to be unstable and were suppressed.
Temporal trends in age-standardized, delay-adjusted cancer
incidence (1999–2013) and death (2000–2014) rates were esti-
mated using joinpoint regression (37,38), with a maximum of
two joinpoints (three line segments) allowed in each model. The
resultant trends were described by the annual percentage
change (APC). The five-year average annual percent changes
(AAPCs) for 2009 to 2013 (incidence) and for 2010 to 2014 (mor-
tality) were calculated using a weighted average of the slope co-
efficients of the underlying joinpoint regression line, with
weights equal to the length of each segment over the interval.
The AAPC was equal to the APC when the AAPC was entirely
within the last joinpoint segment (39). Two-sided statistical sig-
nificance (P < .05) for APC and AAPC was determined using a
t test for the APC and for the AAPC when it lies entirely within
the last joinpoint segment and a z test when the AAPC extends
beyond the last joinpoint segment (40). In describing trends, the
terms “increase” or “decrease” were used when the slope of the
trend (APC or AAPC) was statistically significant; otherwise,
terms such as “stable,” “nonsignificant increase,” and “nonsig-
nificant decrease” were used. Trends based on fewer than 10
case subjects in any of the 15 data years (1999–2013 for inci-
dence and 2000–2014 for mortality) were considered unreliable
and were suppressed.
Survival Ratios and Trends
We used relative survival ratios (RSRs) to examine differences
and changes in five-year survival over time or across geographic
areas. RSR is a measure of excess mortality experienced by can-
cer patients and is calculated by dividing the observed survival
from all causes of death for the patient cohort by the expected
survival as estimated by life tables. Relative survival is a theo-
retical population-based measure representing cancer survival
in the absence of other causes of death. We also calculated ab-
solute and relative (proportional) changes in five-year RSRs be-
tween cases diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 vs 2006 to 2012 for the 20
most common cancers (all ages, by race) and for select child-
hood cancers (0–14 years, all races) and by SEER historic stage
(localized, regional, and distant). For lymphoma, Ann Arbor
staging (stage I, II, III, and IV) (41) was used; z tests were per-
formed to examine if the changes in relative survival over time
were statistically significantly different between whites and
blacks.
To describe differences in survival for the 20 most common
cancers
across
racial/ethnic
groups,
we
calculated
cause-
specific survival rather than RSR because reliable life tables are
not available for NHAPI and NHAI/AN populations. We also
compared the risk of death in NHB, NHAPI, NHAI/AN and
Hispanic populations with the NHW population using hazard
ratios (HRs). These hazard ratios were calculated using Cox re-
gression models, with a maximum of five years of follow-up
and adjusting for sex, age, and summary stage (except for all
cancer sites combined and leukemia). No statistically significant
violations of proportional hazards assumption were found by
testing the interactions between survival time and covariates.
This analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC). All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical sig-
nificance level was set at a P value of less than .05.
For all survival analyses, the survival duration in months
was calculated based on complete dates and 60-month survival
is reported. For registries conducting active follow-up, survival
duration was calculated through the date of last contact (or
study cutoff, if earlier). For the remaining registries (those con-
ducting data linkage with the National Death Index [NDI] only),
survival duration was calculated through December 31, 2012,
with all patients not known to be dead presumed to be alive on
that date. For the analyses based only on SEER data, expected
survival was estimated from race- and sex-specific life tables
for the entire United States. For the analyses by state, expected
survival was estimated from life tables matched to the cancer
patients by age (0–99 years), sex, year, state, race, and county-
level socioeconomic status (SES). Cases were censored at an
achieved age of 100 years.
Results
Cancer Incidence Rates for the Most Common Cancers
Figure 1 shows trends from 1999 to 2013 in age- and delay-
adjusted incidence rates for all cancer sites combined for men
and women. Incidence rates for men decreased throughout the
study period, with the decrease accelerating from 0.6% (95%
confidence interval [CI] ¼ –0.9% to –0.2%) per year during 1999 to
2008 to 2.3% (95% CI ¼ –3.1% to –1.4%) per year during 2008/2009
to 2013. In contrast, over the same 15-year time period, rates for
women remained stable.
Figure 2 presents average annual incidence rates and trends
during 2009 to 2013 for the 17 most common cancers in men
and 18 most common cancers in women. Among men, inci-
dence rates during 2009 to 2013 decreased statistically signifi-
cantly for seven of the 17 most common cancers, including

 prostate (P ¼ .003), lung and bronchus (lung; P < .001), colon and
rectum (colorectal; P < .001), urinary bladder (bladder; P < .001),
esophagus (P < .001), brain and other nervous system (brain; P ¼
.005), and larynx (P < .001). The largest decline was for prostate
cancer, with an average –7.9% (95% CI ¼ –12.2% to –3.3%) decline
per year. In contrast, rates increased statistically significantly
for seven cancers: melanoma of the skin (melanoma), leukemia,
oral cavity and pharynx (oral cavity), pancreas, liver and in-
trahepatic bile duct (liver), myeloma, and thyroid (P < .001, for
all) and stabilized for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), kidney
and renal pelvis (kidney), and stomach cancer.
Among women, incidence rates during 2009 to 2013 de-
creased statistically significantly for seven of the 18 most com-
mon cancers: lung (P < .001), colorectal (P < .001), NHL (P ¼ .003),
ovary (P < .001), bladder (P < .001), cervix uteri (cervix; P ¼ .001),
and stomach (P < .001); however, incidence rates increased sta-
tistically significantly for nine cancers: breast (P < .03), corpus
and uterus not otherwise specified (NOS; uterus; P < .001), thy-
roid (P < .001), melanoma (P < .01), leukemia (P < .001), myeloma
(P < .001), pancreas (P < .001), oral cavity (P ¼ .001), and liver (P <
.001); incidence rates remained unchanged for kidney and brain
(Figure 2). Of note is the statistically significant increase of 0.4%
(95% CI ¼ 0.1% to 0.8%) per year over the past five years in breast
cancer incidence, the most common cancer among women.
Liver cancer among women increased by 3.8% (95% CI ¼ 3.4% to
4.1%) per year over the past five years, replacing thyroid cancer
as the most rapidly increasing incident cancer among women.
For most cancers, the increasing or decreasing trends during
2009 to 2013 in both men and women were continuations of
past trends (Supplementary Table 1, available online).

the annual percent change (APC) over the fixed interval (2009–2013 for incidence, 2010–2014 for mortality) using the underlying joinpoint model for the period of 1999
to 2013 for incidence and the period of 2000 to 2014 for mortality. Joinpoint models with up to two joinpoints are based on rates per 100 000 persons that are age-standard-
ized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups Census P25–1130). Joinpoint Regression Program, version 4.2.0.2. June 2015, Statistical Research and Applications

 Cancer Death Rates for the Most Common Cancers
Figure 1 also shows trends in death rates for all cancer sites
combined from 2000 to 2014 by sex. Death rates decreased sta-
tistically significantly from 2000 to 2014 by 1.8% (95% CI ¼ –1.8%
to –1.8%) on average per year among men and by 1.4% (95% CI ¼
–1.4% to –1.3%) per year among women. Similarly, overall cancer
death rates during the most recent five years (2010 to 2014) de-
creased by 1.8% (95% CI ¼ –1.8% to –1.8%) per year in men by
1.4% (95% CI ¼ –1.4% to –1.3%) per year in women.
Figure 3 presents average annual death rates and trends dur-
ing 2010 to 2014 for the 16 most common cancers in men and 18
most common cancers in women. Among men, death rates dur-
ing this period decreased statistically significantly for 11 of the 16
cancers, including lung by 3.5% (95% CI ¼ –3.9% to –3.2%) per year,
prostate by 3.4% (95% CI ¼ –3.6% to –3.2%) per year, and colorectal
by 2.5% (95% CI ¼ –2.7% to –2.4%) per year. In contrast, rates
increased statistically significantly for cancers of the liver by 2.6%
(95% CI ¼ 2.4% to 2.8%) per year, for pancreas by 0.3% (95%
CI ¼ 0.1% to 0.4%) per year, and for brain by 0.5% (95% CI¼ 0.0% to
1.0%) per year; rates stabilized for bladder and oral cavity cancers.
Among women, during the same time period death rates de-
creased statistically significantly for 13 of the 18 most common
cancer types, including lung by 2.0% (95% CI ¼ –2.2% to –1.8%) per
year, breast by 1.6% (95% CI¼ –1.8% to –1.4%) per year, and colo-
rectal by 2.8% (95% CI ¼ –3.0% to –2.7%) per year. In contrast,
death rates increased statistically significantly for cancers of the
uterus by 2.0% (95% CI ¼ 1.4% to 2.6%) per year and for liver cancer
by 3.0% (95% CI ¼ 2.6% to 3.4%) per year; rates remained stable for
pancreas, brain, and myeloma. As with the incidence trends, the
increase or decrease in death rates for most cancers in both men
and women were continuations of past trends (Supplementary
Table 2, available online).

annual percent change (APC) over the fixed interval (2009–2013) using the underlying joinpoint model for the period of 1999 to 2013. Joinpoint models with up to two
joinpoints are based on rates per 100 000 persons that are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups Census P25–1130). Joinpoint Regression

 Current Cancer Incidence Rates and Trends by Race,
Ethnicity, and Sex
Table 1 depicts average annual age-standardized and delay-
adjusted incidence rates and trends for the most recent five-
year period (2009–2013) by cancer site, sex, race, and ethnicity.
Rates for all cancer sites combined in all racial and ethnic
groups were higher in men than in women (512.9 vs 420.6 per
100 000). Black men and white women had higher overall cancer
incidence rates than any of their racial/ethnic counterparts,
whereas API men and women had the lowest rates. In all racial
and ethnic groups, prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in
women were the most frequent incident cancers, followed by
lung cancer and colorectal cancer, except in Hispanics for
whom colorectal preceded lung cancer. Rankings for several of
the other cancers varied substantially by race and ethnicity in
both men and women. Among men, for example, melanoma
ranked fifth in white men and 19th in black men, whereas liver
cancer ranked 11th in white men and seventh in black men.
Among men, incidence trends during 2009 to 2013 for all
cancers combined and for the 20 most common cancers in each
racial/ethnic group were generally similar to those of all races
combined. Incidence rates decreased statistically significantly
for all cancers combined and for the three most common can-
cers (prostate, lung, and colorectal) in each racial and ethnic
group except AI/AN for lung and colorectal; rates also decreased
for cancers of the stomach, esophagus, and larynx, except that
rates were stable for stomach cancer in whites and for esopha-
gus cancer and larynx cancer in AI/AN. In contrast, incidence

 rates increased in each racial and ethnic group for myeloma
and for cancers of the pancreas and thyroid, except in AI/AN, in
whom rates remained stable. Rates also increased in each racial
and ethnic group for leukemia and liver cancer, except that
rates remained unchanged for leukemia in API and AI/AN and
for liver cancer in API and Hispanics.
Among women, overall cancer incidence rates from 2009 to
2013 increased in blacks, API, and AI/AN but remained stable in
whites and Hispanics. Similarly, rates increased for breast can-
cer in blacks and API, whereas rates remained stable in whites,
AI/AN, and Hispanic women. Rates also increased for thyroid,
liver, and uterine cancers in all racial and ethnic groups, except
that rates decreased for liver cancer in API women. In contrast,
during 2009 to 2013, incidence rates decreased for lung cancer
and colorectal cancer in all racial and ethnic groups, except that
rates increased for lung cancer in API women. As with men, for
most cancer sites, trends in incidence rates for women in each
racial and ethnic group were similar in direction to those of all
women combined.
Current Cancer Death Rates and Trends by Race,
Ethnicity, and Sex
Average annual death rates and trends from 2010 to 2014 are
presented by cancer site, sex, race, and ethnicity (Table 2). For
all cancer sites combined, similar to incidence rates, death rates
(per 100 000) were higher among men than women overall
(200.4 vs 141.5) and in all racial and ethnic groups. Black men
and black women had the highest cancer death rates of any ra-
cial or ethnic group. Among men, lung cancer was the leading
cause of cancer death in all racial and ethnic groups, followed
by prostate and colorectal in black, white, and Hispanic men,
liver and colorectal in API men, and colorectal and prostate in
AI/AN men. Among women, lung, breast, and colorectal cancer
were the leading causes of cancer death in all racial and ethnic
groups except Hispanics, in whom breast replaced lung cancer
as the leading cause of cancer death.
From 2010 to 2014, death rates declined overall and for the
most common cancers (lung, prostate, colorectal, breast) among
men and women of all racial and ethnic groups, except for breast
cancer among Hispanic women, lung cancer and colorectal can-
cer among AI/AN men, and colorectal cancer among API and AI/
AN women (Table 2). Death rates for most of the other cancer
sites declined or were stable among men and women in each ra-
cial and ethnic group; exceptions to these patterns were in-
creases for liver cancer in white, black, and Hispanic men and
women and AI/AN men, for pancreatic cancer in white men, and
for uterine cancer in white, black, API, and Hispanic women.
Cancer Incidence and Mortality Among Children
In children age 0 to 14 years, average annual age-standardized
incidence rates (per 100 000) during 2009 to 2013 ranged from
11.5 in AI/AN to 17.1 in whites (Table 3). Average annual age-
standardized death rates (per 100 000) during 2010 to 2014
ranged from 1.8 in API (95% CI ¼ 1.6 to 2.0) and AI/AN (95%
CI ¼ 1.4 to 2.3) to 2.2 (95% CI ¼ 2.1 to 2.3) in whites. Incidence
rates during 2009 to 2013 increased statistically significantly on
average by 0.4% (95% CI ¼ 0.1% to 0.7%) to 1.0% (95% CI ¼ 0.3% to
1.6%) per year in each racial and ethnic group, except in AI/AN,
in whom rates remained stable. In contrast, death rates during
2010 to 2014 statistically significantly decreased on average by
1.6% (95% CI ¼ –2.0% to –1.3%) per year in all race/ethnicities

†Cancers are sorted in descending order according to sex-specific rates for all races/ethnicities. More than 15 cancers may appear under males and females to include the top 15 cancers in every race/ethnicity group.
‡White, black, API, and AI/AN (CHSDA 2012 counties) include Hispanic and non-Hispanic; the race and ethnicity categories are not mutually exclusive. AI/AN (CHSDA 2012) statistics exclude data from Kansas.
§Rates are per 100 000 persons and were age-standardized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups Census P25–1130).
kAAPC is the average annual percent change and is a weighted average of the annual percent change (APC) over the fixed interval 2009 to 2013 using the underlying joinpoint model for the period of 1999 to 2013. Joinpoint models
with up to two joinpoints are based on rates per 100 000 persons that are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups Census P25–1130). Joinpoint Regression Program, version 4.2.0.2. June 2015, Statistical

 combined and by 1.5% (95% CI ¼ –1.9% to –1.2%) to 2.6% (95%
CI ¼ –4.5% to –0.7%) per year in each racial and ethnic group;
the average annual percent change for AI/AN could not be
calculated because of sparse data (Table 3).
Survival Ratios and Trends
Table 4 shows changes in relative survival for all cancer sites
combined (case-mix adjusted) and for 20 specific sites based on
cases diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 and 2006 to 2012. When com-
paring cases diagnosed during these two time periods, survival
increased statistically significantly in the later-diagnosed group
for all but two cancer types, cervix and uterus, with the greatest
absolute changes (25% or greater) observed for prostate, kidney,
NHL, myeloma, and leukemia and the greatest proportional
changes (100% or greater) observed for esophagus, stomach,
pancreas, liver, and myeloma. Cancers with the lowest five-year
relative survival rates for cases diagnosed in 2006 to 2012 were
pancreas
(8.5%,
95%
CI ¼ 8.0%
to
9.0%),
liver
(18.1%,
95%
CI ¼ 17.3% to 18.9%), lung (18.7%, 95% CI ¼ 18.4% to 19.1%),
esophagus (20.5%, 95% CI ¼ 19.4% to 21.7%), stomach (31.1%, 95%
CI ¼ 30.1% to 32.2%), and brain (35%, 95% CI ¼ 34.0% to 36.0%);
those with the highest were prostate (99.3%, 95% CI ¼ 99.1% to
99.5%), thyroid (98.3%, 95% CI ¼ 97.9% to 98.6%), melanoma
(93.2%, 95% CI ¼ 92.6% to 93.6%), and female breast (90.8%, 95%
CI ¼ 90.5% to 91.1%).
When comparing cases diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 vs 2006 to
2012, survival improved substantially in the later-diagnosed
group for both early (localized) and late-stage (regional, distant)
diseases for most cancer types, including esophagus, colorectal,
female breast, and NHL (Supplementary Table 3, available on-
line). Between 1975 to 1977 and 2006 to 2012, cancer types and
stages that demonstrated a large absolute gain (20% or greater)
in survival included NHL for distant stage, esophagus for local-
ized and regional stages, oral cavity for regional and distant
stages, pancreas and liver cancers for local stage, and female
breast and colorectal for regional stage. Although improve-
ments in survival for distant-stage disease over the past 30
years generally appeared to be small in absolute terms (<10%
absolute gain), they were large in proportionate terms, with sur-
vival rates doubling for several cancers (Supplementary Table 3,
available online). Between 1975 to 1977 and 2006 to 2012, for ex-
ample, five-year relative survival for distant-stage disease in-
creased from 5.5% (95% CI ¼ 4.9% to 6.2%) to 13.7% (95%
CI ¼ 13.0% to 14.4%) for colorectal cancer and from 18.7% (95%
CI ¼ 16.9% to 20.6%) to 33.6% (95% CI ¼ 32.2% to 35.0%) for female
breast cancer. However, survival for many distant-stage cancers
remained unchanged, for example, liver cancer (1.1%, 95%
CI ¼ 0.3% to 2.9%, in 1975–1977 and 2.3%, 95% CI ¼ 1.6% to 3.2%,
in 2006–2012).
Figure 4 depicts changes in survival ratios between 1975 to
1977 and 2006 to 2012 by race for all cancer sites combined and
for the 20 most common cancers. Survival improved substan-
tially over this time period for both whites and blacks overall
(all sites) and for almost all cancer types; however, survival de-
creased for uterine cancer in whites and cervix and ovary in
blacks. The largest absolute increases were observed for pros-
tate cancer (36.7% in blacks and 31.1% in whites), leukemia
(29.0% in whites and 24.1% in blacks), NHL (26.8% in whites and
16.5% in blacks), kidney (26.6% in blacks and 24.7% in whites),
and
myeloma
(25.7%
in
whites
and
22.5%
in
blacks)
(Supplementary Table 4, available online). For lung and pan-
creas cancers, improvements were very limited in both whites

 and blacks. For all sites combined and for most individual can-
cer types, statistically significant racial disparities (black vs
white) in survival rates in 1975 to 1977 persisted in 2006 to 2012.
The magnitude of the disparity between the two time periods
remained similar for most cancer types, but it widened for can-
cers of the esophagus, lung and bronchus, ovary, cervix uteri,
and NHL, while it narrowed for cancers of the urinary bladder,
prostate, and corpus and uterus (P < .05 for all) (Supplementary
Tables 4 and 5, available online).
Table 5 shows five-year cause-specific survival and adjusted
relative risk of cancer death by race/ethnicity in persons diag-
nosed in 2006 to 2012 for all cancer sites combined and for the
20 most common cancers. The five-year survival for all sites
combined was highest for Hispanics (68.2%, 95% CI ¼ 67.9% to
68.4%) and NHW (68.0%, 95% CI ¼ 67.9% to 68.1%), followed by
NHAPI (66.7%, 95% CI ¼ 66.4% to 67.0%), NHB (62.8%, 95%
CI ¼ 62.6% to 63.0%), and NHAI/AN (60.5%, 95% CI ¼ 59.5% to
61.5%). The adjusted relative risk of death after a diagnosis of
cancer (HR) was statistically significantly higher in NHB than
NHW for all cancers combined (HR ¼ 1.33, 95% CI ¼ 1.32 to 1.34)
and for most cancer sites, with the excess risk most notable for
female breast, oral cavity, and uterine cancers and non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. Compared with NHW, Hispanics had statistically
significantly higher risk of death for 10 of the 20 cancers, most
notably for leukemia, but they have lower risk of death after di-
agnosis for lung and cervical cancers. Although NHAPI had
higher adjusted risk of death than whites for all cancers com-
bined, they had lower risk for 12 of the 20 cancers. However,
NHAPI had higher risk of death for oral cavity cancer and for
melanoma, NHL, and leukemia. NHAI/AN had a higher risk of
death than NHW for all cancers combined (HR ¼ 1.51, 95%
CI ¼ 1.46 to 1.56) and for 11 of the 20 cancers, most notably for
leukemia and thyroid cancer.
Survival for patients diagnosed with the four most common
cancers during 2006 to 2012 varied widely by state in both
whites and blacks (Table 6). For example, female breast cancer
survival in whites ranged from less than 88.0% in West Virginia
and Wyoming to more than 92.0% in Colorado, North Dakota,
New Hampshire, and Washington-Seattle; in blacks, it ranged
from less than 76.0% in Arizona, Mississippi, and New Mexico to
more than 87.0% in New Hampshire and Utah. For colorectal
cancer, survival in whites ranged from less than 62.0% in
Arizona, Michigan-Detroit, New Mexico, and Wyoming to more
than 66.0% in Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, New Hampshire,
and North Dakota; in blacks, it ranged from 50.1% in Iowa to
more than 62.0% in Connecticut and Rhode Island. In general,
survival for the four most common cancers tended to be lowest
in select Southern and Midwestern states and highest in

Figure 5 shows five-year survival for select childhood can-
cers diagnosed during two calendar periods, 1975 to 1977 and
2006 to 2012. Survival improved substantially between the two
periods for all cancer types, ranging from an absolute increase
of 16.8% (95% CI ¼ 9.2% to 24.3%) for Hodgkin lymphoma to
48.3% (95% CI ¼ 37.7% to 59.0%) for acute myeloid leukemia
(Supplementary Table 6, available online). By race, five-year sur-
vival for all childhood cancers included in Supplementary Table

60.3%) to 85.3% (95% CI ¼ 84.1% to 86.4%) in white children and
from 57.3% (95% CI ¼ 49.3% to 64.5%) to 82.1% (95% CI ¼ 79.0% to

Discussion
Overall cancer death rates continue to decrease in both men
and women for all major racial and ethnic groups. Rates de-
creased for 11 of the 16 most common cancers in men and for
13 of the 18 most common cancers in women, including lung,
colorectal, female breast, and prostate cancers. In contrast,
death rates increased for liver cancer in men and women, for
pancreas cancer and brain cancer in men, and for uterine cancer
in women. In contrast to overall mortality trends, overall inci-
dence
rates
decreased
in
men
but
stabilized
in
women.
Incidence rates decreased for seven of the 17 most common
cancers in men and seven of the 18 most common cancers in
women, including lung and colorectal cancers, whereas rates
increased for seven cancers in men and nine cancers in women,
including liver, myeloma, melanoma, oral cavity, and thyroid in
both men and women and pancreatic cancer in men. Survival
increased substantially overall and for both early and late-stage
diseases for several but not all cancer sites, and survival varied
statistically significantly by race/ethnicity and state.
Factors that have contributed to the continued decrease in
cancer death rates overall and for the most common cancers
have been described in previous reports (14–18) and include re-
duced tobacco use, which is a well-established cause of 16 can-
cer types and accounts for nearly one-third of cancer deaths
(42), improved early detection (eg, colorectal, breast, and cervix),
and improved treatments for many cancers. In particular, ciga-
rette smoking prevalence among adults over the past 50 years
decreased by more than 50% because of public health policies
against tobacco and increased awareness about the health haz-
ards of smoking (42). However, there are still about 40 million
adult smokers (43), and smoking remains the leading cause of
cancer death (42,44–46). These facts underscore the need for ex-
pansions of federal and state tobacco control programs and the
development of new strategies, such as pricing strategies and
plain tobacco packaging to accelerate the reduction in tobacco
use (47).
Unlike mortality trends, where increases are generally unfa-
vorable and declines are indicators of progress, increases in in-
cidence may reflect changes in detection practice and may have
both positive and negative implications with respect to cancer
control (19,20). For example, the continued increase in mela-
noma and thyroid cancer incidence rates over the past several
decades is in part thought to reflect increased diagnostic scru-
tiny (48–50); however, incidence rates for both cancer types in-
creased for late-stage and large tumors (48,49,51), suggesting

 intermittent recreational sun exposures for melanoma (49) and
radiation and other unrecognized carcinogens for thyroid can-
cer (52). Likewise, trends in prostate cancer incidence rates have
been affected by changes in the uptake of prostate-specific anti-
gen (PSA) testing. Prostate cancer incidence rates decreased
substantially (53,54) following the US Preventive Services Task
Force recommendations against routine screening for PSA test-
ing in men age 75 years or older (2008) and in men age 50 years
or older (2011) (55,56). In contrast, the continued increase in
liver cancer incidence rates is likely due to the high prevalence
of chronic hepatitis C virus infection resulting from intravenous
drug use by baby boomers during the 1960s to 1980s, as well as
the obesity epidemic beginning in the 1980s (18). The obesity ep-
idemic also may have contributed in part to the increases in en-
dometrial, pancreas, and kidney cancer incidence rates (14)
because obesity is estimated to account for 49%, 28%, and 24%
of the total cases, respectively, in the United States (57).
In contrast to adult cancers, there are few known environ-
mental risk factors for childhood cancers (58). According to the
2016 Cancer Statistics Review; however, the increase in the
overall childhood cancer incidence rates during the last five
data years (2009–2013) was largely confined to acute lympho-
cytic leukemia (ALL) and NHL (59), and ALL incidence increased
only in Hispanic white children (60). Known and suspected risk
factors for ALL include parental smoking during pregnancy, pes-
ticide exposure, high birthweight, and Down syndrome, and for
NHL they include Epstein Barr virus and inherited or acquired
immunodeficiency (34,58,60–62). However, we could not find
data to support that these risk factors may have contributed to
the increasing incidence trends in ALL or NHL.
This is the second annual report to include a special section
on population-based survival. The previous report compared
relative five-year survival for two diagnostic periods (1975–1979
and 1995–2000) and examined risks of dying from cancer, once
diagnosed, in each racial and ethnic population compared with
non-Hispanic whites (7). This report extends the most recent di-
agnosis period by 12 years compared with the previous report,
includes temporal changes in stage-specific survival, and pre-
sents contemporary survival data by race/ethnicity and state.
As in the previous report, survival improved over time for al-
most all cancers at every stage of diagnosis. However, survival
remains very low for some cancer sites and for most of the can-
cer sites diagnosed at distant stage. Disparities in survival by
race have persisted over time, and variations in survival by state
of residence are evident in recent data. Although increasing sur-
vival over time reflects progress in treating many cancer types,
survival trends for some cancers must be interpreted with cau-
tion due to biases related to screening and early detection (21)
and should be interpreted in the broader context of trends in in-
cidence, stage at diagnosis, and mortality (63).
Cancer screening can lengthen the survival interval by mov-
ing back the time of diagnosis without changing the eventual
date of death (lead time bias), as well as by identifying relatively
slow-growing cancers that have good prognoses (length bias)
(21). Screening may also lead to overdiagnosis by finding can-
cers that never would have been clinically detected during the
course of the patients’ natural lives (21). It is especially impor-
tant to keep these biases in mind when interpreting survival
trends during time periods when screening for particular can-
cers (eg, female breast cancer and prostate cancer) has been
widely implemented in the general population.
Lead time, length bias, and overdiagnosis are also a concern
when interpreting survival trends for cancer types for which
changes in diagnostic technology or medical care practice have
increased the detection of asymptomatic diseases (21). Among the
cancers for which screening has been widely implemented in the
general population, the greatest absolute increase in five-year rel-
ative survival has occurred for prostate cancer, along with the
greatest controversies about the benefits of screening and treat-
ment (64). Widespread adoption of PSA screening began in 1987,
resulting in a dramatic increase in incidence, and survival trends
are thought to have been influenced by lead time bias, length bias,
and overdiagnosis (64). In addition to screening-related biases,
analysis of prostate cancer survival trends is complicated by in-
consistent stage and grade classification over time (65–67).
Changes in prostate cancer treatment for which there is evidence
of survival benefit include increased use of radical prostatectomy
beginning in the 1980s, radiation therapy in combination with an-
drogen deprivation therapy beginning in the mid to late 1990s,
and protocols for evaluation and treatment of biochemical recur-
rence (68). Despite uncertainties about the benefits and harms of
prostate cancer screening and which treatment approaches are
optimal, it is clear that prostate cancer death rates have declined
substantially in the United States since the early 1990s (67).
Modeling studies that used survival data from clinical trials and
population-based data on incidence and treatment suggest that
stage shift due to screening and changes in treatment have con-
tributed to declining prostate cancer mortality (68).
Increases in survival have also been observed since 1975 for
breast and colorectal cancer, but have been much more limited
for cervical cancer. The introduction of mammography screen-
ing in the 1980s and increasing use in the 1990s led to increased
detection of localized and smaller breast cancers (69,70); within-
stage shifts in tumor size and other prognostic features likely
contributed to increased survival for localized and regional dis-
ease. Survival for distant-stage breast cancer has also been
steadily improving since the early 1990s (71). Concurrent with
the introduction of mammography screening, multiple im-
provements in breast cancer therapy occurred, including the
use of hormonal therapies for hormone receptor–positive can-
cers and multi-agent chemotherapy (72). Modeling studies sug-
gest that both screening and adjuvant therapy contributed to
declines in breast cancer mortality (73).
Several colorectal screening modalities have been used since
the 1980s, but with much slower population uptake than mam-
mography screening (12,74). Detection of colorectal cancer at an
early stage through screening may have contributed in part to
the improvement in the overall survival (12). However, much of
the improvement likely resulted from treatment advances, in-
cluding improved surgical care, adjuvant chemotherapy for pa-
tients with regional (node-positive) disease (75), resection
(surgical removal) of distant disease, and neoadjuvant therapy
for rectal cancer (76). Unlike breast and colorectal cancer, there
has been little progress in overall cancer survival for cervical
cancer during the period studied, in part because Pap test
screening had already been widely disseminated by 1987 (77).
For most cancer types for which screening has not been im-
plemented in the general population, changes in long-term sur-
vival are easier to interpret, although increases in earlier
detection, stage shifts, and changes in staging rules may have
influenced some survival trends. For a number of solid tumors
where surgery is the primary treatment and surgical mortality
is relatively high (eg, esophageal and lung cancer), declines in
surgical mortality have likely contributed to improved survival
(78). Lower surgical mortality may have been achieved through
improvements in anesthesia and supportive care, institution of
quality improvement programs, and regionalization of high-risk
surgeries (78).

 The survival improvements over time highlighted in this re-
port also reflect major advances in systemic therapies for some
cancers, including imatinib mesylate for chronic myelogenous
leukemia in the early 1990s (79), rituximab for B-cell non-
Hodgkin lymphoma in the 1990s (80), and combination of che-
motherapies for childhood cancers beginning in the 1960s
(81,82). In particular, the continued statistically significant im-
provements in five-year survival rates for most cancers occur-
ring in children—with over 80% of children surviving five years
during recent diagnosis years—have been attributed to the sys-
tematic conduct of clinical trials assessing the efficacy of multi-
modal
approaches
involving
combination
chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, and/or surgery with increased expertise in sup-
portive care in specialized cancer centers (83). Member institu-
tions of the Children’s Oncology Group, a National Cancer
Institute supported trials group, care for 90% of children diag-
nosed with cancer in the United States (61,84) .
In this era of increasingly personalized cancer therapy, it is
hoped that dramatic progress in treatment and survival will be
observed for other cancer types as well. It may not be possible
in this analysis to detect the impact of very recent therapeutic
improvements on population survival due to the time lag for
case reporting and follow-up in cancer registry data; examples
include protein kinase inhibitors for non–small cell lung cancer,
colorectal
cancer,
and
chronic
myeloid
leukemia;
anti-
angiogenics (which inhibit blood vessel growth) for colorectal
and ovarian cancers; and immunotherapy for melanoma and
non–small cell lung cancer (85). Such improvements may also
be difficult to discern in population-based registry data for ther-
apies that apply only to subsets of patients for a cancer site.
Although five-year survival for most cancers types improved
among both blacks and whites over the past 30 or more years,
the racial disparities observed for most cancer sites and for all
cancer sites combined in the earlier period (1995–1997) for many
common cancers have persisted, and they may have increased
for prostate cancer and female breast cancer. Much work re-
mains in order to understand the likely multiple causes of these
observed differences; however, they may in part reflect differ-
ences among racial/ethnic groups in receipt or timeliness of rec-
ommended treatments (8,86–90). For example, black women
with breast cancer are less likely to receive and adhere to adju-
vant chemotherapy and more likely to experience delayed initi-
ation of such therapy (86,91,92). The risk of death in blacks
compared with whites was higher overall (all sites) and for the
most common cancers in stage-adjusted analyses.
Similarly, compared with whites, AI/AN had higher risk of
death for almost all cancer types and Hispanics had higher risk
of death for many cancers, which may in part reflect treatment
differences (8,93). In contrast, API had lower risk of death than
whites for most cancers, including lung, colorectal, prostate,
and female breast. While there are limited data showing that re-
ceipt of standard cancer treatments is higher in API than in
whites, API have higher median income than whites and a
higher proportion of persons with college-level education (94).
However, higher survival among API and Hispanics need to be
interpreted with caution because of known issues related to the
follow-up of these patients (95). Further investigation of the fac-
tors that contribute to racial/ethnic survival differences is
needed.
We also found evidence to suggest geographic differences in
survival. For most of the common cancer sites, several north-
eastern states (eg, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island)
often had higher survival than elsewhere, whereas several
southern states (eg, Alabama, Mississippi) often had lower
survival. However, variations in survival by state have to be in-
terpreted with caution as they may reflect differences in popu-
lation demographics (race, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic
status), cancer screening rates, residents’ access to and quality
of cancer care, and cancer registration practices that impact
case ascertainment, date of diagnosis, and follow-up, and/or
other factors (33,96).
Strength and Limitations
This is the first “Annual Report to the Nation” that has used a
single database (41 quality certified cancer registries, covering
89% of the US population) to provide all delay-adjusted inci-
dence statistics. In future years, as the number of quality certi-
fied registries increases, we hope to cover a larger proportion of
the US population and/or present trends using a longer time se-
ries. Monitoring cancer incidence trends is one of the most im-
portant uses of population-based registry data, and the ability
to apply delay adjustment at the national level improves the ac-
curacy and consistency of these results. Similarly, we used a
single database (31 state registries and two metropolitan area
registries) covering 67% of the US population to analyze survival
variations by race/ethnicity and area of residence. High-quality
survival data are vital for identifying disparities in cancer treat-
ment and outcomes.
A limitation of this report is that we used the SEER historic
stage variable for survival analysis to ensure consistency over
time for all cancer sites. The collection of historic stage data by
SEER since 1975 has been valuable for understanding long-term
trends in incidence, survival, and mortality, but in the past de-
cade it has been increasingly difficult to maintain historically
comparable stage data over time. Stage definitions change as
new diagnostic procedures are incorporated and American Joint
Committee on Cancer staging rules are modified to reflect ad-
vances in clinical knowledge. As the collection of increasingly
more information will be necessary to create clinically mean-
ingful disease classifications for prognosis and treatment, ex-
amining and reporting of long-term survival trends by stage
may become difficult or impossible.
On the other hand, the availability of detailed information
on stage and other prognostic factors for almost all incident
cancers in the United States creates unprecedented opportuni-
ties to study the increasing use of new treatments and their im-
pacts on survival in population-based samples. The NCI has
created a valuable national resource for such studies by linking
SEER registry data to Medicare records to augment data on
treatments and comorbidities (97). Ongoing related efforts by
the NCI include the development of a new tool, the “SEER
Cancer Survival Calculator” (SEER*CSC), to provide information
on prognosis of individual patients to help patients and their
families and doctors in making difficult decisions about treat-
ment (98,99). In addition, the CDC has invested resources in uti-
lizing
NPCR
registries
for
conducting
population-based
comparative effectiveness research (100) and in making these
data available to researchers through NCHS’s Research Data
Center (http://www.cdc.gov/rdc/index.htm).
Another limitation of this report is misclassification of race/
ethnicity information in medical records (incidence), death cer-
tificates, and Census. Since 2000, the Census has given respon-
dents
the
option
to
self-select
multiple
race/ethnicity
categories, creating incompatibility with race/ethnicity infor-
mation on medical records and death certificates, which often
have single race/ethnicity categories. To address this problem,

 the US Census Bureau, in collaboration with CDC’s NCHS and
NCI, has developed methods to generate single-race population
estimates, but with some uncertainties about the population es-
timates and resultant rates (101). Furthermore, race/ethnicity
information on death certificates is underascertained for AI/AN,
API, and Hispanics (102), leading to underestimation of cancer
rates. In addition, cancer rates for broad racial and ethnic
groups (eg, Hispanic and API) may mask important variations in
cancer burden by country of origin (103,104).
Finally, as with survival trends, incidence trends need to be
interpreted with caution as changes in incidence rates may re-
sult from changes in risk factor prevalence, increased or de-
creased
use
of
screening
or
diagnostic
techniques,
or
a
combination of these. Further, the AAPC was used as a sum-
mary measure to average trends in magnitude and direction
over the most recent five-year data period using joinpoint re-
gression (39), but one cannot necessarily conclude that rates
continue to increase or decrease throughout the five-year
period.
Future Directions
Cancer survival, particularly for advanced-stage diseases, is ex-
pected to increase markedly in light of recent advances in preci-
sion medicine and immunotherapy for late-stage cancers (eg,
melanoma, lung cancer) (81,82). Further, the White House’s
Cancer Moonshot initiative and other similar initiatives to ac-
celerate progress against cancer aim to build on these recent ad-
vances and find cures (105,106). However, despite many reasons
for optimism about the potential for research to accelerate the
development of highly effective treatments, important chal-
lenges remain in the access and delivery of cancer care to en-
able all populations to benefit from treatment advances. Some
of the new cancer drugs cost $10 000 per month and are not af-
fordable even by most insured patients because of the high out-
of-pocket expenses, which are about 20% of the drug’s cost for
Medicare-insured patients (107–109). The high cost of cancer
treatment dubbed “financial toxicity”(110) has been associated
with reduced spending on groceries and clothing, skipped medi-
cations and physician appointments to save money, bank-
ruptcy, and mortality (111,112). It has been suggested that if
measures are not taken to contain the escalating trend in treat-
ment costs, cancer care in the United States could become less
affordable and could impede the very goal of the Affordable
Care Act, which is to make high-quality health care accessible
to all (113). Cognizant of this problem, the American Society of
Clinical Oncology recently developed a conceptual framework
for medical oncologists to assess the value of cancer treatment
options, with an emphasis on the clinical benefit (efficacy), tox-
icity (safety), and cost (efficiency) of drugs (113).
To accelerate progress in reducing cancer mortality, we
must not only intensify efforts to develop effective targeted
therapies and find cures, but also heighten our efforts to broadly
and equitably apply proven preventive measures. A large per-
centage of the reduction in cancer death rates since 1990 has
come from preventive measures rather than treatment ad-
vances (114–117). For example, Thun and Jemal estimated that
reduced tobacco use over the past four decades alone accounted
for about 40% of the decrease in overall male cancer death rates
from 1991 to 2003 (116). Tobacco use still accounts for nearly
30% of cancer deaths in the United States (44–46), and about
17% of US adults (40 million adults) are current cigarette smok-
ers, with prevalence varying extensively across states (43,118).
Recent reports documented that only North Dakota funded a
state tobacco control program at the CDC-recommended level
during 2016 and nearly half of the states did not have statewide
comprehensive smoke-free laws that ban smoking in bars, res-
taurants, and workplaces (119,120). Devoting increased re-
sources and enacting laws and regulations to strengthen
tobacco control policies at both state and federal levels—such
as tobacco product pricing strategies, plain packaging, statewide
comprehensive smoke-free laws, and reducing nicotine content
in tobacco products to nonaddictive levels (47)—could greatly
reduce morbidity and mortality from smoking-related cancers
and other smoking-related diseases.
Additional interventions for patient and provider education
and outreach programs and interventions aimed at removing
barriers to accessing preventive services are needed to increase
the low or suboptimal uptake of screening for colorectal cancer
(121) and lung cancer (122), human papilloma virus vaccination
(123), and testing for hepatitis C virus infection (124). Additional
resources are also required to create neighborhoods that en-
courage physical activity and healthy eating habits and to iden-
tify
new
approaches
to
prevent
and
reverse
the
obesity
epidemic (125), which accounts for 15% to 20% of total cancer
deaths in the United States (126). Furthermore, more attention
and resources are needed for identifying major risk factors for
common cancers such as colorectal, breast, and prostate. Also
needed are concerted efforts to understand the increasing inci-
dence trends in uterine, female breast, and pancreas cancer, as
well as to plan and implement proven preventive measures
(57,127).
Conclusions
Overall cancer death rates continue to decrease in the United
States, reflecting improvements in prevention, early detection,
and treatment. However, progress in reducing mortality and im-
proving survival is limited for several cancers. This requires re-
newed commitment to redouble our efforts to discover new
strategies for prevention, early detection, and treatment and to
apply proven interventions broadly and equitably.
