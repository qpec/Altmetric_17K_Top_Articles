IMPORTANCE Increased left 
ventricular (LV) mass and diastolic dysfunction are associated 
with cardiovascular disease. Prospective data on effects of 
childhood socioeconomic status 
(SES) on measures of 
LV structure and function are lacking. 
OBJECTIVE To examine whether family SES in childhood was associated with LV mass and 
diastolic function after adjustment for conventional cardiovascular disease risk factors in 
childhood and adulthood. 
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The analyses were performed in 2016 using data 
gathered in 1980 and 2011 within the longitudinal population-based Cardiovascular Risk in 
Young Finns Study. The sample comprised 1871 participants who reported family SES at ages 
3 to 
18 years and were evaluated for LV structure and function 31 years later. 
EXPOSURES Socioeconomic status was characterized as annual income of 
the family and 
classified on a 
3-point scale. 
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Left ventricular mass indexed according to 
height at the 
allometric power of 
2.7 and the E/e' ratio describing LV diastolic performance at ages 34 to 
49 years. 
RESULTS The participants were aged 3 to 
18 years at baseline (mean [SD]. 10.8 [5.0] years), 
and the length of 
follow-up was 31 years. Family SES was inversely associated with LV mass 
(mean [SD] LV mass index, 31.8 [6.7], 31.0 [6.6], and 30.1 [6.4] g/m2·7 in the low, medium, and 
high SES groups, respectively; differences [95% Cl], 1.7 [0.6 
to 2.8] for low vs high SES; 0.8 
[-0.3 to 
1.9] for low vs medium; and 0.9 [0.1 to 
1.6] for medium vs high; overall P 
= .001) and 
E/e' ratio (mean [SD] E/e' ratio. 5.0 [1.0]. 4.9 [1.0], and 4.7 [1.0] in the low, medium. and high 
SES groups, respectively; differences [95% Cl]. 0.3 [0.1 to 0.4] for low vs high SES; 0.1 [ 
-0.1 to 
0.3] for low vs medium; and 0.2 [0 
to 0.3] for medium vs high; overall P 
< .001) in adulthood. 
After adjustment for age, sex, and conventional cardiovascular disease risk factors in 
childhood and adulthood. and participants' own SE5 in adulthood, the relationship with LV 
mass (differences [95% Cl], 1.5 [0.2 to 2.8] for low vs high SES; 1.3 [0 to 2.6] for low vs 
medium; and 0.2 [ 
-0.6 to 
1.0] for medium vs high; P = 
.03) and E/e' ratio (differences [95% 
Cl], 0.2 [0 
to 0.5] for low vs high SES; 0.1 [ 
-0.1 to 
0.4] for low vs medium; and 0.1 [0 
to 
0.3] 
for medium vs high; P = .02) remained significant. 
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Low family SES was associated with increased LV mass and 
impaired diastolic performance more than 3 decades later. These findings emphasize that 
approaches of 
cardiovascular disease prevention must be directed also to 
the family 
environment of 
the developing 
child.

S 
ocioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) present a major and persistent public health chal-
lenge across industrialized nations.' Socioeconomic sta-
tus (SES) is a powerful predictor of 
incident coronary disease 
and adverse cardiovascular outcomes? Whether this robust 
association with SES extends to heart failure (HF) is less cer-
tain, as approximately half 
of 
cases relate to coronary disease. 
3 
Echocardiographically measured left ventricular 
(LV) mass 
is associated with incident HF not related to myocardial 
infarction. 
4 •5 Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is also prog-
nostic of 
incident HF. 
6 •7 Previous studies have shown that low 
educational attainment in middle or older age is associated with 
higher LV mass8 •9 and impaired LV diastolic function. 
9 Occu-
pational status at different stages of 
life course is associated 
with LV mass and diastolic function at age 60 to 64 years.10 
However, to our knowledge, no studies have prospectively ex-
amined whether family SES in childhood, based on the an-
nual income of 
the family, after adjustment for conventional 
CVD risk factors in childhood and adulthood, is associated with 
LV structure and diastolic function. 
Using data from the longitudinal Cardiovascular Risk in 
Young Finns Study cohort, we examined the association of 
childhood family SES in participants aged 3 to 18 years on echo 
measures of 
LV mass and LV diastolic function 31 years later 
in adulthood when aged 34 to 49 years. We have previously 
shown that childhood risk factors are associated with subclini-
cal CVD, eg, increased carotid intima-media thickness11 and 
coronary artery calcification, 
12 even when adjusted with adult-
hood risk factor levels. Therefore, we also performed analy-
ses taking into account the effects ofboth childhood and adult-
hood risk factors. 
Methods 
Participants 
The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study is an ongoing 
multicenter follow-up study to assess risk factors underlying 
CVD.13 The first cross-sectional survey13 was conducted in 
1980, when 3596 individuals aged 3 to 18 years participated. 
These participants were randomly chosen from the national 
register of 
the study areas in different parts of 
Finland. Since 
1980, several follow-up studies have been conducted. The 
31-year follow-up survey was performed in 2011 and 
included analysis of 2063 of the original participants. Of 
these 2063 individuals, 1994 (96.7%) participated in the 
echocardiographic examination. In the present study, the 
sample comprised 1871 participants who were aged 3 to 18 
years at baseline (ie, childhood in 1980) who provided data 
on family SES in childhood and echocardiographic data at 
follow-up (ie, adulthood in 2011), when aged 34 to 49 years. 
All participants provided written informed consent, and the 
study was approved by the Turku University Hospital ethical 
committee.

Key Points 
Question Is childhood family socioeconomic status associated 
with left ventricular mass and diastolic function in adulthood? 
Findings In this cohort study of 
1871 participants, family 
socioeconomic status in childhood was related to left ventricular 
mass and diastolic function even after adjustment for age, sex, 
conventional cardiovascular risk factors both in childhood and 
adulthood. and participants' own socioeconomic status in 
adulthood. 
Meaning These data suggest that adverse childhood 
socioeconomic environment is associated with higher left 
ventricular mass and poorer diastolic function in middle age. 
of the family in childhood.14 The questionnaire included in-
come categories from 1 
(lowest) to 8 (highest). Family income 
in 1980 was converted into its present-day value and 3 in-
come groups were formed: low (response options 1-2, !OUS 
$14 600), medium (response options 3-5, >US $14 600 to !OUS 
$32 200), and high (response options 6-8, >US $32 200). As sen-
sitivity analysis, we additionally defined family SES accord-
ing to parental occupation.15 Parental occupation was coded 
from 1 to 5 (1, indicating farmers; 2, lower manual; 3, upper 
manual; 4, lower nonmanual; and 5, upper nonmanual). 
Cardiovascular Risk Factors 
Height and weight were measured, and 
body mass index (BMI) 
was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared. Blood pressure was measured using a random-
zero sphygmomanometer. The average of3 measurements of 
blood pressure was used in the analyses. For the determina-
tion of 
serum lipid levels, venous blood samples were drawn 
after an overnight fast both in childhood and adulthood. These 
analyses, as well as measurements of 
adulthood glucose lev-
els, were performed with standard enzymatic methods. Infor-
mation on smoking habits (participants' and participants' par-
ents') was obtained with a questionnaire. Data on childhood 
smoking were collected in participants aged 12 to 18 years. In 
adulthood, a questionnaire was used to gather data on par-
ticipants' SES (annual income).14 A 
questionnaire was also used 
to assess data on favorable emotional family environment and 
to subsequently comprise a score consisting of 
4 components 
(absence of 
diagnosed parental mental disorder, high paren-
tal caregiving nurturance, high parental life satisfaction, and 
reasonable alcohol use).16 In the score, all components indi-
cated 1 
point; thus, the scale range was 0 to 4. 
Echocardiography 
Echocardiographic examinations were performed in adult-
hood according to American and European guidelines. 17-19 
Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed with Se-
quoia 512 (Acuson) ultrasonography, using a 3.5-MHz scan-
ning frequency phased 
-array transducer. Analyses of 
the echo 
images were performed by a single observer. Both the sonog-
rapher and the observer were blinded to the participants' de-
tails. Standard echocardiographic examinations were pro-
duced from the standardized image planes and modes17:

ness + septal wall thickness]' - LV end-diastolic diameter')]} 
+ 
0.6.17 Left ventricular mass was indexed according to height 
at the allometric power of 2.7 (indexed LV mass = LV mass/ 
height2 ·7 ) because this indexation performs better in the con-
text of 
overweight/obesity. 
20 Transmitral flow and tissue ve-
locities were measured using continuous and pulsed-wave 
Doppler to define LV diastolic performance index, E/e' ratio, 
as previously described. 
17 In this study, most of the values 
of LV mass index and E/e' ratio are within the normal 
range17(Figure 1 
and Figure 2). 
Statistical Analyses 
To examine the associations of 
childhood cardiovascular risk 
factors with childhood family SES, we used age- and sex-
adjusted linear regression for continuous outcome variables 
and age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression for binary vari-
ables. Associations of family SES in childhood with cardiac 
structure and function in adulthood were examined using 
linear regression. Pairwise comparisons of the SES groups 
were adjusted with the Tukey-Kramer method. The analyses 
were performed both unadjusted and adjusted with age, sex, 
and conventional cardiovascular risk factors (BMI, systolic 
blood pressure, smoking, low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) 
in childhood and adulthood. To examine age and sex differ-
ences in the association ofSES with LV mass and E/e' ratio, in-
teraction terms of age-by-SES and sex-by-SES were used. No 
significant age or 
sex differences were detected indicating that 
the effect of SES on LV mass and E/e' ratio was similar be-
tween different age groups and between male and female par-
ticipants. Thus, age groups and sexes were analyzed com-
bined. All statistical tests were performed using SAS version 
9.4 (SAS Institute) with statistical significance inferred at a 
2-tailed P value < .OS.

Results 
Baseline characteristics of 
the study participants according to 
childhood family SES status are shown in Table 1. The partici-
pants were aged 3 to 18 years at baseline (mean [SD], 10.8 [5.0] 
years), and the length of 
follow-up was 31 years. Participants 
with higher family SES tended to be younger at baseline. Sig-
nificant age- and sex-adjusted trends for childhood family SES 
groups were observed for baseline measures of 
parental smok-
ing, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol, triglycerides, and favorable emotional 
family environment score. 
Adult LV mass index and E/e' ratio among the childhood 
family SES groups are depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2, 
respectively, showing an inverse association of family SES 
with LV mass and E/e' ratio (adjusted for age and sex). In 
analyses that adjusted for risk factors both in childhood and 
adulthood, and participants' own SES (annual income) in 
adulthood, the inverse relation between childhood SES and 
both adult LV mass and E/e' ratio remained significant 
(Table 2 and Table 3). Concerning other risk variables, child-
hood BMI, adulthood BMI, and childhood low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol were directly associated with LV mass in 
this age- and sex-adjusted multivariable analysis. Childhood 
favorable emotional family environment score, triglycerides, 
and adulthood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 
inversely associated with LV mass. Accordingly, adulthood 
BMI and systolic blood pressure were directly associated 
with E/e' ratio (eTable 1 
in the Supplement). The associations 
of family SES with LV mass and E/e' ratio were similar when 
parental occupation was used as an indicator of family SES 
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). For LV mass, the results were 
also similar in participants aged 12 to 18 years at baseline 
(n = 588) in a model that further adjusted for each partici-
pant's own smoking status in childhood (differences [95% 
CI], 2.8 [0.8 to 4.9] g/m2·7 for low vs high SES; 2.7 [0.6 to 4.7]

P = .18). In eTable 3 and eTable 4 in the Supplement, we have 
repeated the analyses shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respec-
tively, using data on only the participants who had complete 
data on all childhood and adulthood risk factors. In addition, 
a sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding has been 
provided in the eAppendix in the Supplement. 
Discussion 
These prospective data suggest that adverse childhood socio-
economic environment is associated with higher LV mass and 
poorer diastolic function more than 3 decades after the base-
line evaluation. Family SES in childhood, characterized on the 
basis of 
family annual income, was related to LV mass and dia-
stolic function even after 
adjustment 
for age, sex, and conven-
tional cardiovascular risk factors in childhood. Moreover, the 
inverse association of 
family SES with LV mass and diastolic 
function was independent of 
adulthood conventional cardio-
vascular risk factors and participants' own SES in adulthood. 
Left ventricular hypertrophy 
is 
associated with CVD mor-
bidity in adulthood.4 Of cardiovascular risk factors, child-
hood obesity is linked with eccentric LV hypertrophy in 
adulthood. 
21 Here, we observed that 
childhood family SES was 
associated with adult LV mass after adjustment for BMI and 
other conventional CVD risk factors measured both in child-
hood and 
adulthood. Moreover, the association was in 
de 
pen-
dent of 
participants' own 
SES in 
adulthood. These results sug-
gest that family SES in early life is an important determinant 
of 
subsequent LV mass. 
Left ventricular diastolic function is recognized as an 
im-
portant marker of 
hemodynamic status. Here, we examined 
LV diastolic function by using the E/e' ratio, where E wave in 
the pulsed Doppler registration describes the early mitral in-
flow in diastole, and e' in the tissue Doppler registration mea-
sures the mitral annular longitudinal motion in early dias-
tole. The E/e' ratio is considered the best echocardiographic 
measurement of diastolic function in the estimation of LV 
filling pressure.19 In 
this study, we observed that children with 
lower family SES had poorer LV diastolic performance in 
adult-
hood. This finding is important because LV diastolic perfor-
mance is associated with primary cardiac events22 and inci-
dentHF.7 
Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with HF 
development. 
3
·23 The effect is only partly explained by 
established CVD risk factors measured in adulthood.3 
To our 
knowledge, this study is the first that prospectively exam-
ined the association of 
childhood SES with subsequent car-
diac structure and function also taking into account the role 
of childhood risk factors. This is important because differ-
ences in risk factor levels related to SES have been observed 
in the life course already in children and adolescents. 
24 
However, even though we also found differences in several 
childhood CVD risk factors according to family SES, the asso-
ciation of 
family SES on adult measures of LV mass and dia-
stolic function remained significant after adjustment of 
CVD 
risk factors measured both in childhood and adulthood. 
These findings suggest that differences in childhood CVD

risk factors are not necessarily the principal pathway linking 
low childhood SES and adverse changes in cardiac structure 
and function. Other potential mechanisms may underlie the 
findings observed in this study. Previously it has been sug-
gested that childhood SES and early family environment 
contribute to metabolic functioning through pathways of 
depression, hostility, and poor quality of 
social contacts. 
25 
Adverse childhood experiences, including abuse, neglect, 
and household dysfunction, have also been associated with 
many health risk behaviors and diseases. 
26·27 A model intro-
duced in 2012 suggests that positive psychological experi-
ences may at the same time increase restorative processes 
(eg, healthy behaviors) and decrease deteriorative processes 
(eg, inflammation), leading to better cardiovascular health. 
28 
We have previously reported that higher SES and positive 
psychosocial factors in childhood are associated with subse-
quent cardiovascular health, as defined by the American 
Heart Association.15·1
" In this study, however, the association 
of family SES in childhood with adult LV mass and diastolic 
function was independent of the number of positive emo-
tional factors in the childhood family. 
Limitations and Strengths 
This study had limitations. First, cardiac magnetic resonance 
imaging may be a more sensitive way to measure ventricular 
mass and volumes than transthoracic echocardiography. 
29 
However, echocardiography is still the most used application 
particularly 
in clinical practice. Second, echocardiography was 
not 
assessed in childhood in this cohort, and thus we were not 
able to determine at what stage of the life course childhood 
family SES begins to 
associate with 
cardiac structure and func-
tion. Third, some limitations in the classifications of 
SES are 
also noteworthy. For example, unemployment, poor health, 
and other life circumstances may have affected the family's 
income and subsequent classification of 
SES. Fourth, even 
though we showed that family SES in childhood was associ-
ated with LV mass and diastolic function after adjustment for 
conventional CVD risk factors in childhood and adulthood, we 
were not able to separate the factors affecting these covari-
ates from the 
factors affecting 
the 
long-term outcomes. Fifth, 
because our 
study 
cohort 
was racially homogeneous, the gen-
eralizability of 
our 
results 
is limited to 
white populations. Dur-
ing the extensive study period of 
the Cardiovascular Risk in 
Young Finns Study, it is inevitable that loss to follow-up oc-
curs. However, the 
study 
group has 
been dynamic, and 
we have 
previously reported that baseline risk factor levels were es-
sentially similar among participants and nonparticipants.30 
Thus, the present study population is likely representative of 
the original population. Major strengths of 
this study 
include 
the prospective study design and the long follow-up of par-
ticipants who were well phenotyped both in childhood and 
adulthood. 
Conclusions 
Low family SES in childhood, after adjustment for conven-
tional CVD risk factors in 
childhood and adulthood, was as

Socioeconomic Status With Left Ventricular Structure 
ciated with increased LV mass and poorer diastolic perfor-
mance 3 decades later in adulthood. These findings further 
emphasize that approaches of CVD prevention must be di-
rected also to 
the family environment of 
the developing child. 
Particularly, support for families with low SES may pay off 
in 
sustaining cardiovascular health to later life.
