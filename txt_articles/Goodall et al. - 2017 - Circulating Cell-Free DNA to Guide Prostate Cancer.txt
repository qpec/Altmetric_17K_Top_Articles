Biomarkers for more precise patient care are needed in metastatic prostate can-
cer. We have reported a phase II trial (TOPARP-A) of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in 
metastatic prostate cancer, demonstrating antitumor activity associating with homologous recombina-
tion DNA repair defects. We now report targeted and whole-exome sequencing of serial circulating cell-
free DNA (cfDNA) samples collected during this trial. Decreases in cfDNA concentration independently 
associated with outcome in multivariable analyses (HR for overall survival at week 8: 0.19; 95% CI, 
0.06–0.56; P = 0.003). All tumor tissue somatic DNA repair mutations were detectable in cfDNA; allele 
frequency of somatic mutations decreased selectively in responding patients (χ2 P < 0.001). At disease 
progression, following response to olaparib, multiple subclonal aberrations reverting germline and 
somatic DNA repair mutations (BRCA2, PALB2) back in frame emerged as mechanisms of resistance. 
These data support the role of liquid biopsies as a predictive, prognostic, response, and resistance 
biomarker in metastatic prostate cancer.
SIGNIFICANCE: We report prospectively planned, serial, cfDNA analyses from patients with metastatic 
prostate cancer treated on an investigator-initiated phase II trial of olaparib. These analyses provide 
predictive, prognostic, response, and resistance data with “second hit” mutations first detectable at 
disease progression, suggesting clonal evolution from treatment-selective pressure and platinum 
resistance. Cancer Discov; 7(9); 1006–17. ©2017 AACR.

iNtRODUctiON
Metastatic prostate cancer is a major cause of cancer mor-
tality in males globally. Studies indicate substantial inter- 
and intrapatient genomic heterogeneity, although treatment 
to date has not incorporated molecular stratification (1–7). 
Clinical qualification of predictive biomarkers is a major need 
for these invariably lethal tumors. We previously reported 
that 20% to 30% of lethal prostate cancers have deleterious 
aberrations in genes involved in DNA repair by homolo-
gous recombination [homologous recombination deficiency 
(HRD)], including BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, PALB2, FANCA, 
CHEK2, and CDK12 (4). Studies indicate that HRD-associated 
mutations associate with a worse prognosis, with these aber-
rations being inherited in approximately 10% to 12% of men 
with lethal prostate cancer (8, 9).
We also recently reported an investigator-initiated phase 
II clinical trial (TOPARP-A) of the PARP inhibitor olapa-
rib (Lynparza) in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, 
describing antitumor activity associating with HRD (10). 
These data led to olaparib being given “Breakthrough Desig-
nation” by the FDA for advanced prostate cancer associated 
with BRCA2/ATM defects, and registration trials of different 
PARP inhibitors being currently pursued (11–13). A major 
regulatory approval challenge for these drug development 
efforts remains the lack of proven surrogates of survival bene-
fit. We hypothesized that circulating biomarkers can enhance 
drug development and patient care, informing on treatment 
response and resistance. Response biomarkers are crucial 
to improving the care of advanced prostate cancer, which is 
often characterized by metastatic disease only to bone, which 
 
is not easily evaluable (14). Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 
in blood, acquired from plasma by a simple blood test, pro-
vides repeated serial access to tumor DNA as a minimally 
invasive “liquid biopsy” (15–19).
We report here preplanned cfDNA analyses from serial 
blood samples from the TOPARP-A trial. We had hypoth-
esized that cfDNA analyses can enhance drug develop-
ment and patient care and that: (i) changes in cfDNA 
concentrations in response to treatment would be prognostic;

(ii) next-generation sequencing of cfDNA would detect the 
predictive HRD-associated mutations found in tumor biop-
sies; (iii) changes in cfDNA somatic mutation allele frequency 
on therapy would associate with response; and (iv) serial 
cfDNA analyses could detect the evolution of resistant sub-
clones at disease progression.
ResUlts
Patient Characteristics and Blood 
Sample Disposition
Fifty patients were treated in the TOPARP-A trial; 49 were 
evaluable for response, with 16 patients responding to treat-
ment. Overall, 16 of these 49 patients had prostate cancers with 
a deleterious aberration in homologous recombination DNA 
repair genes, with 14 of these patients responding to treat-
ment. Serial samples for cfDNA studies were available for 46 of 
 
49 patients (94%). We now report on these analyses utiliz-
ing updated outcome data based on a data snapshot taken 
on May 24, 2016. One patient with a BRCA2 homozygous 
deletion remained on therapy and free of progression at the 
data cutoff, after 22 months of therapy. Overall, the median 
cfDNA baseline concentration across the trial population 
was 31.6 ng/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 19.4–57.1]. Next-
generation targeted sequencing of cfDNA was successful for 
43 of 46 patients (93%; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Prognostic Relevance of Changes in cfDNA 
Concentration Following PARP Inhibition
Changes in cfDNA concentration were evaluated in 
patients responding (n = 16) or not responding (n = 30) to 
olaparib. After 4 weeks of therapy, there was a median −51.4% 
change in responders (IQR, −72.6% to −29.5%) and a median 
−33.4% change in nonresponders (IQR, −52.3% to +5.5%; 
 
P = 0.07). After 8 weeks of therapy, responders continued to 
experience sustained declines (median −49.6% change; IQR, 
−76.5% to −20.4%), differing significantly from nonrespond-
ers (median +2.1% increase; IQR, −43.6% to +57.8%; P = 0.006; 
Supplementary Fig. S2).
Next, we explored how declines in cfDNA concentrations 
correlated with patient outcome based on radiologic pro-
gression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). cfDNA 
concentration falls robustly correlated with rPFS as early as 
after 4 weeks of therapy [HR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval 
(CI), 1.13–2.55; P = 0.01 for cfDNA log fold change; HR, 0.41; 
95% CI, 0.21–0.80; P = 0.009 for absence/presence of ≥50% 
fall from baseline of cfDNA concentration]. cfDNA concen-
tration falls after 8 weeks of olaparib correlated with both 
prolonged rPFS and OS (Fig. 1).
In multivariable analyses including established prognostic 
factors, such as LDH and circulating tumor cell (CTC) count 
conversions, a ≥50% decline in cfDNA concentration after 4 
weeks of olaparib was independently associated with longer 
rPFS. These changes at 4 weeks were not statistically signifi-
cant for OS (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.18–1.07; P = 0.07). Never-
theless, a ≥50% fall in cfDNA concentration after 8 weeks of 
therapy was independently associated with longer OS (HR 
for ≥50% cfDNA decline and OS in multivariable analyses: 
0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.56; P = 0.003; Table 1).
Changes in Allele Frequency of Somatic Mutations
We then performed next-generation targeted sequencing 
of serial cfDNA samples to assess allele frequency of somatic 
mutations during PARP inhibitor therapy as an indirect esti-
mate of tumor burden. A total of 254 plasma samples were 
analyzed. We detected somatic mutations in cfDNA of 33 
of 43 baseline samples. Olaparib treatment led to sustained 
decreases in cfDNA mutation allele frequencies in respond-
ing patients; sustained (≥8 weeks) falls in cfDNA somatic 
mutation allele frequencies were not observed in nonre-
sponding patients, although 3 of 29 detected somatic events 
in nonresponding patients decreased transiently after 4 weeks 
of olaparib (χ2 P < 0.001; Fig. 2A).
Somatic HRD-Associated Mutations in cfDNA
Overall, 6 subjects in the TOPARP-A trial had tumors with 
somatic mutations likely to be associated with HRD (3 in 
ATM, 2 in BRCA2, 1 in PALB2; 5/6 responded to olaparib); all 
6 mutations were detected in baseline cfDNA. In all 5 respond-
ing patients, these somatic mutation allele frequencies all 
decreased to <5% following olaparib treatment (Fig. 2B). In the 
nonresponding patient, the somatic mutation allele frequency 
remained unchanged at 4% throughout therapy.
In addition, in one nonresponding patient we detected two 
ATM frameshift mutations in cfDNA not previously detected 
in the tumor biopsy. Retrospective inspection of tumor data 
detected both mutations in 3% of sequencing reads. We 
obtained a further metastatic biopsy from a different ana-
tomic location after treatment; both of these ATM mutations 
were present in 18% and 29% of reads, respectively. We also 
evaluated this patient’s primary prostate tumor biopsy taken 
at diagnosis; one of these mutations was not present and the 
other was visualized in 1% of reads. Overall, these data indicate 
that these were probably subclonal mutations.
Loss of Heterozygosity in Germline  
Mutation Carriers
Five patients with pathogenic BRCA2 or ATM germline 
mutations responded to olaparib in the trial. In 4 of these, 
we had previously documented loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 
for these pathogenic mutations in tumor biopsies. In these 
4 patients, falls in the cfDNA allele frequencies of these 
germline mutations toward 50% were observed as they 
responded to olaparib, suggesting elimination of the tumor 
clone with LOH. For the last patient with an ATM mutation, 
but no LOH in his tumor biopsy, allele frequencies remained 
between 45% and 55% in the cfDNA at all time points in con-
cordance with the tumor tissue findings (Fig. 2C).
Mechanisms of PARP Inhibitor Resistance 
Detected in cfDNA
Ten of 16 patients having an initial tumor response to 
olaparib had cfDNA samples acquired at the time of resistance 
and disease progression. In addition to targeted sequencing, 
we successfully performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) 
from paired plasma samples collected before olaparib treat-
ment and at disease progression for 6 patients to study 
mechanisms of secondary resistance to PARP inhibition. In 
a seventh case, we performed WES in the progression sample

to low DNA yield.
In both of the patients with a germline BRCA2 frameshift 
mutation, we identified at the time of tumor progression 
additional somatic BRCA2 mutations in cfDNA restoring the 
normal open reading frame (Fig. 3).
One of these patients had a germline BRCA2 p.-1056fs 
mutation and LOH in the pretrial tumor biopsy. At the time 
of disease progression, a further somatic deletion of four 
base pairs emerged, resulting in an overall in-frame change 
of four amino acids (p.K1057_Q1063delinsTEQA). In paral-
lel, three other events were detected in different positions 
in the same genomic region, all of them also restoring the 
BRCA2 normal open reading frame, and probably represent-
ing the coexistence of several resistant tumor subclones 
in cfDNA. This patient had bone metastases in the spine 
and pelvis; after an initial partial response to olaparib, he 
developed a heterogeneous pattern of progression after 
9 months; a bone marrow biopsy of a relapse focused in 
the right hemipelvis was performed (Fig. 4). In this tumor 
sample, only one of the three emerging somatic reversions 
(p.K1057_Q1063delinsTEQA) was detected; these data sug-
gest these other emerging subclones may have originated in 
different metastases.
A second germline BRCA2 mutation carrier (p.E1514fs*15) 
developed an additional deletion of 28 bp at progression, 
reverting BRCA2 back in frame. We confirmed the emer-
gence of this new event independently by targeted next-
generation sequencing (MiSeq). In addition, we also detected 
the emergence at progression of a somatic ARID1A mutation 
(p.Q1145*). These aberrations again indicate possible diver-
gent clonal evolutionary resistance mechanisms as a result of 
PARP inhibition–generated selective pressures.
In nongermline mutation carriers, we also identified new 
emerging genomic events at progression leading to the rever-
sion of a somatic BRCA2 mutation (Fig. 5). A somatic 2-bp 
frameshift deletion was detected in WES of the original 
tumor biopsy and in targeted sequencing of the baseline 
plasma sample (p.Y2154fs*21). Because of DNA yield, we 
could not obtain WES of the baseline cfDNA sample in this 
patient. At progression, WES revealed two alternative dele-
tions resulting in an in-frame deletion but restoring the open

reading frame of BRCA2 coexisting with the original clone 
containing the frameshift mutation.
In addition, secondary genomic events causing reversion 
back to normal reading frame of a somatic PALB2 mutation 
were also detected for one patient. The pretreatment sample 
contained a 2-bp frameshift deletion (p.-253fs*3) with LOH. 
At the time of progression, after 9 months of treatment, two 
different new mutations restoring the PALB2 reading frame 
were identified (Fig. 5). Both events coexisted with the origi-
nal clone, again indicating divergent resistant subclones.
We examined the nucleotide sequences flanking the BRCA2 
and PALB2 original frameshift deletions in these cases with

baseline *100) after 4- and 8 weeks of therapy. Stars, patients considered responders to olaparib in the TOPARP-A trial in the predefined primary endpoint. 
An absolute decrease of ≥10% in allele frequency was observed in 18 of 27 somatic mutations detected in responding patients as compared with 3 of 29 
somatic events monitored in nonresponding patients (χ2 P < 0.001). None of the three allele frequency falls in nonresponding patients were maintained after 
8 weeks of therapy. B, Four examples of how AF of somatic HRD-associated mutations decrease in response to therapy, in parallel with decreases in total 
cfDNA concentrations. A patient with an ATM p.-2288fs mutation had intermittent increases and decreases in AF in parallel to drug interruptions due to 
hematologic toxicity. C, Changes in cfDNA mutation allele frequency over time in germline deleterious mutation carriers (BRCA2 and ATM) in 5 patients from 
the TOPARP-A trial. Those patients with LOH at baseline have the cfDNA mutation allele frequency trending toward 50% in response to therapy, probably 
due to elimination of the tumor clone. This is not seen in the serial cfDNA samples from the patient whose tumor did not have LOH.

Figure 3.  Visual representation of emerging de novo mutations at progression that likely result in acquired drug resistance in two patients with 
germline BRCA2 mutations. Top, a patient with a germline deleterious BRCA2 frameshift insertion that was present in both tumor and cfDNA at baseline 
presents at disease progression with a new frameshift deletion that restores the BRCA2 reading frame; bottom, a second patient with a germline delete-
rious BRCA2 mutation is depicted; at progression cfDNA WES identified multiple clones with different previously undetected mutations all resulting in 
reversion of the BRCA2 reading frame to normal.

Figure 4.  Single-site disease progression after 9 months of response to therapy in the right hemipelvis visualized by diffusion-weighted whole-body 
MRI. Top, fusion of the T1-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging; bottom, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Areas of high signal on 
diffusion-weighted imaging and low ADC values indicate tumor bone marrow infiltration. Left, baseline MRI scan, showing diffuse tumor infiltration in the 
pelvic bone. The first trial biopsy was taken from the left iliac bone (red circle) and identified a deleterious BRCA2 mutation with LOH. After 12 weeks 
of therapy (middle), there was a major response to therapy reported. After 9 months (right), the MRI identified a focal area of tumor relapse in the right 
iliac bone, which was biopsied (red arrow). Next-generation sequencing of this biopsy confirmed a de novo mutation in BRCA2 restoring the open reading 
frame.

secondary gene mutations. In some of these multiple resist-
ant subclones emerging in parallel, we observed short regions 
of nucleotide sequence identity flanking the new deletions. 
This association with microhomology regions suggests 
that these might have evolved as a consequence of defective 
homologous recombination and the utilization of alternative 
error-prone DNA repair mechanisms.
Finally, in one patient with HDAC2 biallelic somatic loss 
in the tumor biopsy, WES demonstrated subclonal divergent 
evolution and new mutations emerging at progression in 
TP53 and TSC2 (GAP domain), which have been associated 
with drug resistance (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 20, 21).
Among the remaining patients with plasma cfDNA evalu-
ated at secondary resistance, we did not detect any other such 
events, although 2 of these patients discontinued the drug 
due to tolerability issues prior to radiologic progression. No 
emerging mutations or copy-number changes in PARP1 or 
PARP2 were observed in any of these samples.
DiscUssiON
In this study, we describe the clinical utility of cfDNA 
analyses as multipurpose biomarkers for treatment with 
PARP inhibition in metastatic prostate cancer. Critically, our 
cfDNA analyses detected all somatic HRD-associated muta-
tions identified in tumor biopsies as well as new mutations 
emerging at disease progression. These new mutations likely 
represent tumor subclones induced by therapeutic selective 
pressure driving drug resistance.
The emergence of secondary mutations in BRCA1/2 
 
germline mutation carriers has been previously described in 
case reports and small retrospective series of patients with 
breast or ovarian cancer after PARP inhibition and/or plati-
num chemotherapy (22–24). Here, we report the first series of 
patients homogeneously treated within a prospective clinical 
trial; mutations reverting the reading frame of mutated 
homologous recombination genes were detected not only in 
germline BRCA2 mutation carriers but also, for the first time, 
in tumors harboring somatic loss of BRCA2 and PALB2. These 
events were confirmed independently by orthogonal targeted 
sequencing of cfDNA and/or tumor biopsy DNA.
These multiple genomic events driving resistance emerged 
in parallel, indicating clonal divergence with functional 
convergence, restoring homologous recombination repair 
proficiency. A similar concept has been recently described 
after exposure to androgen receptor (AR)–targeting agents 
in prostate cancer, with emergence in parallel of multiple AR 
aberrations (25–30). Monitoring this subclonal equilibrium 
between the original clone and resistant clones merits further 
evaluation, as PARP inhibitor discontinuation and admin-
istration of other treatments could potentially restore the 
dominance of the original clone sensitive to PARP inhibitor 
or platinum.
Interestingly, in two cases, small tracts of DNA homology 
flanked all these multiple secondary mutations. These were 
reminiscent of similar deletions observed in preclinical mod-
els restoring the open reading frame of the gene and causing 
PARP inhibitor resistance, and probably arose from the use 
of error-prone DNA repair processes that predominate in the 
absence of functional BRCA2 (31–33).
In the case with the original somatic PALB2 mutation, the 
initial clinical response to olaparib, followed by PARPi resist-
ance characterized by the emergence of secondary mutant 
PALB2 alleles with microhomology-associated intragenic 
deletions, is strongly suggestive of the PALB2 mutation in 
this patient causing a homologous recombination defect 
which not only drives the initial PARPi sensitivity pheno-
type but also the mechanism of resistance that eventually 
emerges. Although preclinical studies have suggested that 
PALB2 defects are associated with defective homologous

recombination, this is to the best of our knowledge the first 
evidence that the homologous recombination defect caused 
by a PALB2 mutation might drive not only drug sensitivity 
but also resistance.
These data are of major clinical relevance for subsequent 
treatment strategies for this subset of prostate cancers, and 
probably also for other cancer types. Platinum chemother-
apy also has antitumor activity in BRCA2-deficient prostate 
cancers (34), but our data indicate likely cross-resistance at 
least for some patients between PARP inhibitors and plati-
num. Clinical trials of PARP inhibitors and platinum-based 
chemotherapy in prostate cancer should therefore account 
for previous exposure to these drugs and the presence of these 
secondary reversion mutations.
Overall, our data show the potential of serial cfDNA next-
generation sequencing to evaluate both temporal and spatial 
disease heterogeneity. In some cases, cfDNA could monitor 
the emergence of resistance mechanisms more comprehen-
sively than single-site biopsies. Such analyses may allow us to 
truly deliver more precise patient care by integrating real-time,

presenting somatic frameshift mutations in BRCA2 (top) and PALB2 (bottom), respectively, in the pretreatment samples. In both cases, the sample 
at treatment progression showed two different new deletions resulting in in-frame deletions and restoring the reading frame for BRCA2 and PALB2, 
respectively. In both cases, these clones were coexisting with the original clone that was present prior to treatment.

 Response and Resistance to PARP Inhibition in cfDNA
RESEARCH ARTICLE
 
SEPTEMBER  2017 CANCER DISCOVERY | 1015 
noninvasive, repeated assessment of disease biology. Our study 
also shows that simple, inexpensive, cfDNA quantification, and 
tumor mutation allele frequency analyses, have clinical utility as 
a response biomarker to guide early treatment switch decisions 
in the presence of ineffective therapies. Although further valida-
tion studies are needed, these findings may be of huge impor-
tance, as earlier discontinuation of therapy for futility can spare 
patients the toxicity of ineffective overtreatment, allowing these 
men to receive alternative therapy and decreasing treatment 
health economic costs to fund these cfDNA studies.
A limitation of our study is that we did not collect samples 
between week 16 of therapy and cancer progression, which in 
some cases meant over a year of olaparib therapy. Therefore, we 
were unable to determine precisely when these restoring resist-
ance mutations emerged; this has clinical relevance as these 
may appear before disease progression detection by established 
methods and allow earlier treatment changes. In the ongo-
ing TOPARP-B trial, which is further evaluating responses to 
olaparib in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, preselected 
based on DNA repair aberrations, monthly samples are being 
collected to address this. Furthermore, our assays were limited 
to exon sequencing, so it remains possible that some of these 
tumors had alternative undetected resistance mechanisms.
In conclusion, we provide strong evidence that serial cfDNA 
analyses are a powerful test for guiding prostate cancer care 
allowing disease molecular stratification, response assessment, 
and the study of emerging resistant clones. Critically, we report 
previously undetectable divergent emerging subclones in 
cfDNA only at disease progression due to treatment-selective 
pressures, with multiple reversion genomic events restoring 
the DNA repair gene function, all causing acquired resistance 
through convergent mechanisms. Directing patient treatment 
through the early detection of emerging resistant tumor clones 
in cfDNA, either by adding other treatments or by switching 
therapy contingent on which clone is dominant, is envisioned. 
This could have a major impact on the treatment and outcome 
of not only prostate cancer but also other malignancies.
MethODs
Study Population
All samples were collected prospectively as part of the TOPARP-
A clinical trial (CRUK/11/029; NCT01682772). Patients provided 
written informed consent prior to trial participation. Full details of 
trial design, eligibility criteria, and response to treatment have been 
reported previously (10). The study of cfDNA as response and resist-
ance biomarker was included as an exploratory endpoint of the study.
cfDNA Extraction and Quantification
Thirty milliliters of blood was collected in CTP tubes from each 
patient at prespecified time points: at baseline and after 1, 4, 8, and 
16 weeks of therapy, and at disease progression when possible. Cir-
culating free DNA was extracted from 4 to 8 mL of plasma using the 
QIAsymphony (Qiagen) and the Circulating DNA Kit (Qiagen) and 
quantified by Quant-iT High Sensitivity Picogreen Kit (Invitrogen).
Targeted cfDNA Sequencing
Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed as described 
previously (10). Libraries were constructed from 40 ng of cfDNA 
using a customized GeneRead DNAseq Mix-n-Match v2 panel 
 
(Qiagen) and sequenced on the MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina). The 
somatic variant calls were manually inspected in the Integrative 
Genomics Viewer (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA).
Whole-Exome cfDNA Sequencing
WES was performed using Kapa Hyper Plus Library Prep Kits and 
the Agilent SureSelectXT V6 target enrichment system. Paired-end 
sequencing was performed using the NextSeq 500 (2 × 150 cycles; 
Illumina). FASTQ files were generated from the sequencer’s output 
using Illumina bcl2fastq2 software (v.2.17.1.14, Illumina) with the 
default chastity filter to select sequence reads for subsequent analysis. 
All sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome reference 
sequence (GRCh37) using the BWA (v. 0.7.12) MEM algorithm, with 
indels being realigned using the Stampy (v.1.0.28) package. Picard tools 
(v.2.1.0) were used to remove PCR duplicates and to calculate sequenc-
ing metrics for quality control check. The Genome Analysis Toolkit 
(GATK, v. 3.5-0) was then applied to realign local indels, recalibrate base 
scores, and identify point mutations and small insertions and deletions. 
Somatic point mutations and indels were called using MuTect2 by 
comparing tumor/plasma DNA to  
germline control, and copy-number 
estimation was obtained through modified ASCAT2 package.
Statistical Analyses
rPFS was defined as the time from trial entry to progression 
(RECIST 1.1, bone scan-PCWG2; refs. 35, 36) or death. OS was 
defined as the time from trial entry to death. Response was defined 
in the trial protocol as either response by RECIST 1.1, PSA decline 
of ≥50%, and/or conversion of CTC from baseline ≥5 cells to <5 
cells/7.5 mL on treatment, requiring a confirmatory assessment at 
least 4 weeks later. Mann–Whitney and Fisher exact tests were used 
to assess the association of continuous and categorical variables 
with response. Kaplan–Meier curves are presented for time-to-event 
endpoints. The prognostic significance of changes in cfDNA at week 
4 and week 8 from baseline were explored using landmark analyses. 
Patients experiencing rPFS and/or OS events before the landmark 
time were excluded. HRs were estimated utilizing Cox regression 
univariate and multivariable models; 95% CIs are provided. In the 
absence of a validated cutoff, log fold change, 30% and 50% declines 
in cfDNA were evaluated. The proportional hazards assumption of 
the Cox model was tested using Schoenfeld residuals. On the basis 
of the exploratory nature of these analyses, Bonferroni adjustment 
of P values was not pursued but a P value <0.01 was predefined as 
significant to account for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were 
conducted using STATA13 (StataCorp LP) on a data snapshot taken 
on May 24, 2016, when 49 of 50 patients had discontinued the trial.
