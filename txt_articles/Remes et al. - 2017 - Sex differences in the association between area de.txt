ABSTRACT
Objective: Studies have shown that area-level
deprivation measured by factors, such as non-home
ownership, non-car ownership and household
overcrowding, can increase the risk for mental disorders
over and above individual-level circumstances, such as
education and social class. Whether area-level
deprivation is associated with generalised anxiety
disorder (GAD) independent of personal circumstances,
and whether this association is different between British
women and men is unknown.
Design: Large, population study.
Setting: UK population-based cohort.
Participants: 30 445 people from the general
population aged 40 years and older and living in
England consented to participate at study baseline, and
of these, 21 921 participants completed a structured
health and lifestyle questionnaire used to capture GAD.
Area deprivation was measured in 1991 using Census
data, and GAD was assessed in 1996–2000. 10 275
women and 8219 men had complete data on all
covariates.
Main outcome measure: Past-year GAD defined
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV).
Results: In this study, 2.5% (261/10 275) of women
and 1.8% (145/8219) of men had GAD. Women living
in the most deprived areas were over 60% more likely
to develop anxiety than those living in areas that were
not deprived (OR=1.63, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.21;
p=0.001), but this association between deprivation and
GAD was not apparent in men (OR=1.13, 95% CI 0.72
to 1.77; p=0.598).
Conclusions: The absolute numbers of people living
in deprived conditions are large worldwide. This,
combined with a growing mental health burden, means
that the findings obtained in this study remain highly
relevant. The WHO has emphasised the need to reduce
social and health inequalities. Our findings provide a
strong evidence base to this call, showing that the
environment needs to be taken into account when
developing mental health policy; gender is important
when it comes to assessing the influence of the
environment on our mental health.
INTRODUCTION
Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)1 is a
common and persistent disorder, and is asso-
ciated with increased risk for disability and
suicide.2–5 GAD can lead to serious impair-
ment in social and occupational functioning,
and once it develops, it increases the risk for
major
depression,
substance
misuse
and
serious physical medical conditions.5–8 This
disorder has a chronic course and is difficult
to treat.5 Consequently, it is important that
its risk factors are identified for prevention
and targeted intervention.
Few studies have assessed the risk factors of
GAD; therefore, information is scarce. The
studies that
have
been
undertaken
have
focused on characteristics measured at the
level of the individual, such as personal
income and education,9–11 demographics12 13
and
family
history
of
psychopathology.13
However, research has shown that the living
context, such as area deprivation, can have
profound effects on health, independent of
personal characteristics.14–16 Area deprivation
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ We used a large, population-based sample of
middle-aged and older-aged adults and adjusted
for a range of important confounders, such as
sociodemographic factors and medical history.
▪ We used a structured, self-reported questionnaire
to assess the presence of past-year generalised
anxiety disorder, and participants were followed
for 7 years.
▪ We measured area deprivation by employing a
commonly used and theoretically sound index.
▪ Those who participated in this study were some-
what less deprived and healthier than individuals
living in other parts of England; therefore, our
results may not generalise to people living in
extremely deprived circumstances.

 refers to residential environments or living contexts
characterised by factors, such as high levels of unemploy-
ment, non-home ownership, non-car ownership and low
income.14
Many studies conducted in western countries have
shown that living in areas characterised by high-income
inequality can lead to significantly increased risks for
serious
medical
conditions
and
mortality.15
16
A
meta-analysis of cohort studies showed that people living
in areas of high-income inequality, as measured by the
GINI index, had an increased risk for mortality.17
Population-based studies further showed that living in
disadvantaged neighbourhoods or places where there is
high chronic stress can increase the risk for mental dis-
orders, such as depression.18–20 Whether area depriv-
ation can be used to predict GAD is unknown.
In this population-based, cohort study, we examine the
association between area deprivation and GAD, while
controlling for a number of confounders, including pre-
vious medical conditions, major depressive disorder and
sociodemographic factors. Results are presented separ-
ately for women and men, and this is performed for
several reasons. Research has shown that women are
more likely to develop anxiety compared with men,
mainly due to genetic and hormonal factors, social roles
or
gender
norms
and
environmental
factors.21–23
Gender has been linked to resources derived from the
environment.21
22 Compared with men, women have
been shown to have less access to material resources and
social status positions, and this can influence mental
health. Women also seem to interact with their environ-
ment differently. For example, women are exposed to
different stressors compared with men, because of
gender differences with respect to social roles.18 21
Despite these differences, research examining the link
between the living context, such as area deprivation, and
mental health among women and men, separately is
scarce. It remains unclear whether there are sex differ-
ences in the association between area deprivation and
risk of GAD—and our objective in this study will be to
assess this. Knowing that one sex is at risk of developing
anxiety when exposed to deprived circumstances helps
to tailor interventions and allocate scarce resources
according to need.24
METHODS
Data
were
drawn
from
the
European
Prospective
Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk, whose design
and study methods have been described in detail else-
where.25
In
brief,
a
prospective
population-based
cohort of 30 445 participants aged 40–74 years were
recruited by post between 1993 and 1997 through
general
practice
age–sex
registers
in
the
city
of
Norwich and the surrounding small towns and rural
areas
(77 630
people were
initially
invited
to
join
EPIC-Norfolk). At baseline (1993–1997), 30 445 partici-
pants consented to join the study and completed a
postal Health and Lifestyle (HLQ) questionnaire that
captured information on sociodemographics, including
sex, marital status, highest educational attainment and
self-reported physician diagnoses of physical diseases.
Using participants’ postal codes, a measure of area
deprivation was derived based on the 1991 Census.
Social
class
was
also
obtained
from
the
Census.
Between 1993 and 2000, participants completed self-
reported postal questionnaires, provided they: (1) were
still alive, (2) did not ask to be removed from the
study’s mailing list and (3) had a valid mailing address.
During 1996–2000, 20 921 participants completed a
structured, psychosocial Health and Life Experiences
(HLEQ) questionnaire. During this time, an assessment
of GAD and major depressive disorder (MDD) was made
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV)1 26 (figure 1).
Using the HLEQ questionnaire, age and then disability
measures based on the SF-36 were also derived.27
All participants recruited through general practice reg-
isters and who completed a baseline health question-
naire were eligible to be included in our study; those

 who completed a psychosocial questionnaire during
follow-up were eligible to be included in our analysis.
Dependent variable
The primary outcome in this study was past-year GAD.
The self-reported HLEQ questionnaire captured the
onset and offset timings of episodes of past-year GAD.26
Past-year GAD consisted of at least one episode that had
offset within 12 months of administration of the HLEQ.
DSM-IV GAD was present if participants reported having
uncontrollable, excessive worry for 6 months or longer
on most days than not that resulted in disability or
impairment. In addition, at least three of the following
symptoms needed to have been present: restlessness,
irritability, muscle tension, fatigue, trouble concentrating
because of worry, mind going blank, trouble falling
asleep, trouble staying asleep and feeling keyed up or on
edge.
Individual-level measures (potential confounders)
Individual-level measures included age, sex, social class,
marital status and educational level. The final categorisa-
tion of the variables took cell size into account and was
also performed in accordance with previous litera-
ture.26
28–33
Social
class
was
derived
using
the
Computer-Assisted Standard Occupational Coding34 and
categorised as follows: (1) professionals, (2) managerial
and technical occupations, (3) non-manual and manual
(skilled workers), (4) partly skilled workers and (5)
unskilled manual workers. To assign social class to men
and women, the male partner’s current or past occupa-
tion was used. If this information was not available, the
female partner’s occupation was used. If the social class
from either partner was unavailable, then it was coded
as missing. The final categorisation of social class
included manual: skilled manual, partly skilled and
unskilled; and non-manual: professionals, managerial
and technical, and skilled non-manual. Marital status
was categorised into three groups: married, single (or
never married) and others (widowed, divorced, sepa-
rated). Educational attainment was categorised into high
(vocational or formal qualifications at the A-level or
O-level or degree-level qualifications) versus low (no
formal qualifications).
Individual-level health status was assessed through the
construction of a variable capturing major prevalent
physical diseases associated with anxiety.35 This was
based on HLQ questions asking participants: ‘Has the
doctor ever told you that you have any of the following?’,
followed by a list of options, such as allergies, asthma,
cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, thyroid conditions,
etc. To determine disability levels, we used the physical
component
summary
score
(PCS)
of
the
Medical
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36), a widely
used, validated self-assessment tool. Higher scores indi-
cate better health. PCS scores were dichotomised above
and below the median. Lifetime MDD was assessed
using the HLEQ.26
All of these individual-level variables were regarded as
potential confounders and selected based on the litera-
ture
and
their
association
with
anxiety35–38
and
deprivation.39 40
Area-level measure (exposure variable)
To examine area deprivation, we used one of the most
commonly used measures of area deprivation in the UK:
the Townsend index.41
42 This index is a composite
measure of four variables obtained from the 1991
Census: (1) percentage of economically active residents
over age 16 who are unemployed, (2) percentage of
households that do not possess a car, (3) percentage of
private households that are not owner-occupied, and (4)
percentage of private households that are overcrowded
(have more than 1 person per room). These variables
were obtained at the level of the enumeration district.
These four factors were then standardised by deriving Z
scores (dividing the mean by the SD across enumeration
districts in England and Wales). The Z values of the
four
variables
were
added
together
to
produce
a
Townsend index score for each enumeration district.
Positive values of the index indicate enumeration dis-
tricts that are more deprived, while negative values indi-
cate those that are less deprived; 0 represents the
national mean. The postal codes of participants were
record linked to enumeration districts, and participants
were considered to live in deprived areas depending on
the Townsend index score assigned to their enumer-
ation district.41
The Townsend deprivation index was also disaggre-
gated into its four constituent components to determine
whether any one of these four is associated with GAD or
if it is the combined components that matter.
Statistical analysis
Characteristics of the participants were compared by
GAD status. We used correlated data analysis to assess
the association between individual-level and area-level
risk factors of GAD. A population-average model was
constructed, which accounted for the potential correl-
ation introduced by the clustering of individuals within
enumeration
districts.
To
estimate
the
population-
average effect of the risk factors of interest on past-year
GAD, we used generalised estimating equations. As past-
year GAD represents a binary outcome (yes/no) and
the intracluster correlation is assumed to be equal, GEE
with a logit link and an exchangeable correlation struc-
ture was used. Adjusted ORs and 95% CIs based on
robust SEs were estimated. Standard multivariate logistic
regression was also conducted and compared with the
findings based on GEE.
Individual-level
measures
consisted
of
sociodemo-
graphic and health-related variables, whereas the area-
level
measure
comprised
the
Townsend
index.
Townsend index scores were used to create a dichotom-
ous variable, with 0 as the cut-point (representing the
national average). Similarly, when the Townsend index

 was disaggregated into its four consistent components,
each variable was dichotomised using 0 (the national
average) as the cut-point.
Analyses were conducted separately for men and
women. First, unadjusted effect estimates were deter-
mined. Next, models were constructed to adjust for (1)
age, social class, educational attainment; then for (2)
age, social class, educational attainment, lifetime history
of MDD; and finally for (3) age, social class, educational
attainment, lifetime history of MDD, physical diseases
and disability level. Age was first assessed as a categorical
variable, and subsequently divided into 10-year bands.
Models were constructed for participants with complete
measurements on all covariates. It was not possible to
group the GAD variable otherwise since it was created
and categorised according to the DSM-IV,26 43 and area
deprivation was analysed in accordance with the litera-
ture.31 44 In a subsequent analysis, a fully adjusted model
was built in which the Townsend index was replaced by
its four constituent components to determine whether
any one of these four variables is significantly associated
with GAD.
Finally, analyses were run with GAD without MDD as
the outcome, in which past-year MDD was excluded. All
models used two-sided statistical tests and a p value of
<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses
were implemented in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS)
V.9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
To arrive at the study size, we went through the follow-
ing steps: of the 30 445 who completed the baseline
HLQ, we retained those participants who completed the
HLEQ (20 921), and of these, we kept those people with
complete data on all covariates (18 494) (figure 1).

of the study.
RESULTS
A total of 77 630 people from general practices in
Norfolk were invited to take part in the study, and of
these, 30 445 consented. The characteristics of respon-
ders versus non-responders are compared in online
supplementary
appendix
I;
compared
with
non-
responders, those who took part consisted of slightly
more women and slightly younger participants. Of the
30 445 people recruited at baseline, 20 921 completed
the HLEQ during follow-up. Of those who completed
the HLEQ, 18 494 (88.4%) were available for analysis in
this study, because they had data on all covariates. The
number of missing observations for each covariate was: 9
for education, 47 for marital status, 497 for GAD, 468
for MDD, 458 for social class, 75 for the Townsend
index and 1386 for the SF-36. Participants were followed
between 1993 and 2000 (7 years).
The study sample consisted of a total of 10 275 women
and 8219 men over the age of 40. Table 1 shows the dis-
tribution of individual-level and area-level characteristics
by past-year GAD.
The overall prevalence of past-year GAD was 2.5%
(261/10 275) for women and 1.8% (145/8219) for men.
Women and men with GAD were <50 years of age, of
higher educational attainment, single, in non-manual
occupations, with prevalent physical diseases, higher
levels of disability and MDD (table 1).
Findings from the correlated data analysis showed that
the risk of GAD in women living in the most deprived
areas was over 70% higher than in those living in the
least deprived areas, even after adjusting for age and
sociodemographics (OR=1.77, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.36)
(table 2).
The OR reduced slightly after additionally controlling
for MDD (OR=1.65, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.22, p=0.001), but
remained significant. A strong association was present
after further adjusting for prevalent physical diseases
and disability (OR=1.63, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.21; p=0.001).
To further determine the aspect of deprivation that is
specifically related to GAD in women, the four separate
components of the Townsend index were included in a
fully adjusted model. Results showed that the effect esti-
mates were highest for non-car ownership (OR=1.46,
95% CI 0.98 to 2.17; p=0.061), followed by non-home
ownership (OR=1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.86; p=0.222) and
were lowest for unemployment (OR=1.07, 95% CI 0.76
to 1.52; p=0.694) and overcrowding (OR=0.75, 95% CI
0.53 to 1.07; p=0.111); these variables did not reach stat-
istical significance.
In men, no association existed between anxiety and
area deprivation in unadjusted and adjusted analyses
(model C OR=1.13, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.77; p=0.598)
(table 3).
We had similar findings when logistic regression was
used in these models instead of GEE, suggesting that
the intraclass correlation is negligible (findings not
shown).
To assess whether deprivation was associated with past-
year GAD without MDD in women, we excluded partici-
pants reporting past-year MDD (while controlling for all
covariates in a fully adjusted model). Deprivation contin-
ued
to
be
strongly
associated
with
past-year
GAD
(OR=1.61, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.43) (findings not shown).
In
men,
the
association
was
still
statistically
non-
significant (OR=1.34, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.47).
DISCUSSION
In this analysis of data from a population-based, cohort
study, we show, for the first time, that area deprivation is
significantly associated with increased risk for GAD in
women, but not in men. The association in women was
independent of characteristics measured at the level of
the individual, including sociodemographics and major
medical conditions. When we assessed the specific

 aspects of deprivation associated with anxiety in women,
we found that those living in areas characterised by a
high level of non-car ownership and non-home owner-
ship were at increased risk of GAD, although the associa-
tions were not statistically significant. It appears that it is
the overall effect of living in deprivation rather than a
particular aspect of the living context that is associated
with a statistically significantly increased risk of anxiety
in women. It is difficult to show causality between area
deprivation and GAD; however, a rigorous analysis based
on cohort data is a an acceptable method of examining
this relationship. The analysis was rigorous, because we
used reliable and commonly used measures of area
deprivation and GAD, controlled for covariates that are
associated with the exposure (area deprivation) and
outcome (GAD), had access to a large sample size of
over 18 000 people and followed participants for a long
period (7 years).
Potential mechanisms
The context as measured by Census composite depriv-
ation indices appears to have a different relationship
with the mental health of women and men, even after
adjusting for individual socioeconomic status, demo-
graphics and other psychiatric and major medical condi-
tions. Several mechanisms can account for this. Women
perceive, relate to and engage differently from men.45 46
Women are more exposed to the living context perhaps
due to their greater uptake of part-time work and
domestic or childrearing duties.47 Since they are more
embedded in their neighbourhoods, they are also more
likely to be exposed to the stress that comes with living

been associated with central nervous system dysfunction
and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysregulation,
which
have
been
implicated
in
the
aetiology
of
GAD.50 51 Women may also perceive the environment
differently compared with men. Neighbourhood safety
and fear of being sexually assaulted appear to be much
more of a concern for women.48 52 If women perceive
their neighbourhood to be unsafe, they are less likely to
engage in activities, such as walking, and this can nega-
tively impact their mental health.48 53 Perceiving neigh-
bourhoods as unsafe can also erode social cohesion and
can make women more hesitant to create social ties with
others.21 This can increase their risk of depression and
related mental disorders, because women derive health
benefits from being embedded in social networks.21
Living in deprivation can also make individuals feel
excluded from society and ashamed,54 and these feelings
of
exclusion
are
particularly
harmful
for
women’s
mental health.21 54
Men and women may also perceive and exhibit the
effects of stress in different ways.55 Women who are
highly distressed tend to develop internalising disorders,
while men are more prone to substance abuse and anti-
social personality.56 The National Epidemiologic Survey

in deprivation might be more likely to develop negative
outcomes, such as heavy drinking, rather than anxiety.
Strengths and weaknesses and future research
This study reveals that anxiety in women is strongly
linked with area disadvantage. It has several strengths.
We had a large, population-based sample of middle-aged
and older-aged adults and adequately adjusted for a
range of possible confounders. We used a structured,
self-reported questionnaire to assess the presence of
past-year GAD, and participants were followed for a long
period of time. We overcome methodological limitations
of previous studies by employing a commonly used,
theoretically sound measure of area deprivation captur-
ing important features of the environment, such as
unemployment and non-home ownership. We also had a
large list of self-reported physician diagnoses of chronic
physical diseases that we used to establish medical histor-
ies. Despite this, the residual effect of diseases not cap-
tured by our study, but that are associated with GAD may
be present. Past illness may have been under-reported,
which may have introduced measurement error and atte-
nuated effect estimates towards the null. Participants
were
required
to
complete
detailed
dietary
and
lifestyle questionnaires and undergo periodic health
assessments.
Since

who
participated
in
EPIC-Norfolk were somewhat less deprived and healthier

our results may not generalise to people living in
extremely deprived circumstances. When comparing the
demographic characteristics of responders versus non-
responders (see online supplementary appendix I), we
found that participants were slightly younger and slightly
more women than men consented. The association
found within our cohort is unlikely to be explained by
selection bias. It is unlikely that the association in non-
responders would be in the opposite direction to that
which we obtained in our study.
Another limitation is that some of the areas classified
as deprived in 1991 might have shown an improvement in
socioeconomic circumstances over time and become
more affluent, and vice versa. Although this might present
an issue for samples drawn from busy, urban environ-
ments, we expect changes in area-level circumstances for
the EPIC-Norfolk cohort to have been small. Many
EPIC-Norfolk participants come from rural areas, where
significant urban development and change in the residen-
tial environment are unlikely to have occurred during the
study period.31 Nonetheless, to account for potential
changes in GAD rates and area-level circumstances, future
studies should assess the association between anxiety and
area deprivation at multiple time points.
Although area deprivation was measured in 1991 and
GAD in 1996–2000, we expect the association between
anxiety and area deprivation in women to be even stron-
ger with more recent data. First, older, as well as, more
recent literature has shown that poor women or those
living in disadvantage are more likely to develop nega-
tive health outcomes, while men less so.23 46 58 Second,
women are increasingly taking on multiple roles in
society, such as income-earner, childbearer and carer,
which is adding to their burden (especially if they are
living in deprivation).24 Third, research has also shown
that anxiety rates have been increasing in women in
recent times.59 For these reasons, we expect the associ-
ation between area deprivation and GAD to be even
stronger in women at the present time.
Future research should consider assessing the risk of
GAD in countries with high social and material inequal-
ities, such as the USA, where the rates of anxiety are also
some of the highest in the world.60 Compared with the
UK, the overall prevalence of GAD in the USA is more
than twice as high, and middle-aged people are most
affected, with a prevalence of 7.7%.61 It would be espe-
cially informative to repeat this study in less developed
parts of the world, such as India, where poverty is
strongly linked to the development of mental disorders,
and women’s unequal status and social roles in society
represent important additional issues.62
Implications for future generations and placing our
research in context
The consequences of living in deprivation are far-
reaching and can affect future generations. Repeated
exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood is
a consistent predictor of poor mental health in adoles-
cence and young adulthood, particularly for young
girls.63 Since anxiety disorders tend to emerge in early
adolescence, repeated exposure to socioeconomic disad-
vantage in childhood can increase the risk for more
severe, early-onset forms of the disorder. Early-onset
forms are the most difficult to treat and have a poor
prognosis.64 Our study is the largest to date to examine
the link between area deprivation and GAD.
Although other studies have shown that the places
where
people
live
have
a
substantial
impact
on
health,15 16 studies on the links between area depriv-
ation and mental disorders among men and women,
separately are limited. A recent, large, population-based
study18 of over 21 000 people living in Ireland showed
that area deprivation was associated with a significantly
increased risk for common mental disorders in women,
but not in men, after controlling for demographic and
socioeconomic factors. In line with this, a study21 of
over 2700 adults living in Canada showed that greater
neighbourhood disadvantage also was associated with
increased risk of depressive symptoms in women, but
not in men. Research conducted in the USA had
similar findings.54 This indicates that characteristics of
the living context seem to influence women’s health in
particular. Very few studies have assessed the association
between deprivation and mental health among women
and men, separately and research specifically focusing
on anxiety disorders is scarcer still.
Our findings differ from the only other population-
based, contextual study of generalised anxiety among
men and women living in areas of low socioeconomic cir-
cumstances.23 In this cross-sectional study, no association
with anxiety was found; however, the measure of depriv-
ation was based only on the local unemployment rate
and median area income. Thus, the results are not dir-
ectly comparable to ours. Further, the previous study
used
the
Symptoms
Checklist-90-Revised
scale
to
measure symptoms of generalised anxiety, yielding differ-
ent estimates than ours. In contrast to the DSM-IV, the
Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised scale did not base the
definition
of
generalised
anxiety
around
excessive,
uncontrollable worry, which is the central, defining
feature of GAD, and used a much shorter time frame to
assess symptoms. We used a thorough assessment of
DSM-IV GAD, which was measured in the past year. In
contrast to the previous study, we also examined area
deprivation using a common, theoretically-sound index,
covering a wide range of key domains relating to socio-
economic disadvantage, such as non-home ownership
and non-car ownership. Studies assessing other health
outcomes have suggested that the residential environ-
ment has a larger effect on women’s health,23 46 while
individual-level factors relating to social status, such as
employment,
have
the
greatest
impact
on
men’s
health.45 Among disadvantaged women, it is not lack of
money per se that leads to poorer health, but rather the
inability to derive the necessary resources from the

 environment to make ends meet; this can translate into
stress and anxiety.65 Women are becoming financially
independent as they enter the labour force, which
means that economic hardship now impacts them, as
well. Women perceive economic hardship as a barrier to
managing daily life and making ends meet, which can
increase their anxiety. In contrast, men link joss loss to a
decline in social status.45 57 65 When men experience
job-related stresses, they tend to externalise the effects of
such stress and develop substance abuse.57 59
Interpretation
The absolute numbers of people living in deprived con-
ditions are large worldwide. This, combined with a
growing mental health burden, means that the findings
obtained in this study remain highly relevant. The
WHO66 has emphasised the need to reduce social and
health inequalities. Our findings provide a strong evi-
dence base to this call, showing that ‘perhaps the most
important risks to health are beyond people’s immediate
control’67 and that the environment needs to be taken
into account when developing mental health policy.
Gender is important when it comes to assessing the
impacts of the environment on our mental health. Our
study shows that investments made to improve local
areas will not impact men and women in the same way.
Regarding
clinical
implications,
health
professionals
should consider assessing anxiety in women living in
deprivation.
