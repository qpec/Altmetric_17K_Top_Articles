On August 26, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR 
Early Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a postinfectious autoim-
mune disorder characterized by bilateral flaccid limb weak-
ness attributable to peripheral nerve damage (1). Increased 
GBS incidence has been reported in countries with local 
transmission of Zika virus, a flavivirus transmitted primarily 
by certain Aedes species mosquitoes (2). In Puerto Rico, three 
arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are currently circulating: 
Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. The first locally acquired Zika 
virus infection in Puerto Rico was reported in December 2015 
(3). In February 2016, the Puerto Rico Department of Health 
(PRDH), with assistance from CDC, implemented the GBS 
Passive Surveillance System (GBPSS) to identify new cases 
of suspected GBS (4). Fifty-six suspected cases of GBS with 
onset of neurologic signs during January 1–July 31, 2016, were 
identified. Thirty-four (61%) patients had evidence of Zika 
virus or flavivirus infection; the median age of these patients 
was 55 years (range = 21–88 years), and 20 (59%) patients 
were female. These 34 patients were residents of seven of eight 
PRDH public health regions. All 34 patients were hospitalized 
and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIg), the 
standard treatment for GBS; 21 (62%) required intensive care 
unit admission, including 12 (35%) who required endotracheal 
intubation and mechanical ventilation. One patient died of 
septic shock after treatment for GBS. Additionally, 26 cases of 
neurologic conditions other than GBS were reported through 
GBPSS, including seven (27%) in patients with evidence of 
Zika virus or flavivirus infection. Residents of and travelers 
to Puerto Rico and countries with active Zika virus transmis-
sion should follow recommendations for prevention of Zika 
virus infections.* Persons with signs or symptoms consistent 
with GBS should promptly seek medical attention. Health 
care providers in areas with ongoing local transmission seeing 
patients with neurologic illnesses should consider GBS and 
report suspected cases to public health authorities.
Epidemiologic Surveillance for GBS
In February 2016, as part of the ongoing response to local 
Zika virus transmission (3–5), PRDH implemented GBPSS 
with CDC assistance. Health care providers throughout the 
island are requested to report all patients with suspected GBS 
to PRDH by submitting a case report form† along with patient 
specimens (serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], and saliva). 
Reporting of patients with other neurologic disorders and a 
suspected antecedent arboviral infection is also encouraged. 
All submitted specimens are tested at CDC Dengue Branch 
(San Juan, Puerto Rico) or PRDH Biological and Chemical 
Emergencies Laboratory using a Trioplex reverse transcription–
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to detect nucleic 
acid from Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses.§ Serum 
and CSF specimens are also tested by immunoglobulin M 
(IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for all 
three viruses. Persons with Zika virus nucleic acid detected by 
RT-PCR in any specimen are considered to have confirmed 
Zika virus infection. Persons with negative results for Zika virus 
by RT-PCR in all specimens tested are considered to have pre-
sumptive recent infection with a single arbovirus when results 
are positive for that virus by IgM ELISA, and presumptive 
flavivirus infection if they test positive for both Zika virus and 
dengue virus by IgM ELISA. Neurologic diagnosis for GBS 
cases with evidence of arboviral infection was confirmed by 
chart review using the Brighton Collaboration criteria, a set 
of standardized diagnostic criteria based on clinical presenta-
tion, CSF laboratory results, and electrophysiologic findings 
(6). Chart reviews are performed after hospital discharge, 
>28 days after onset of neurologic signs for persons who remain 
hospitalized, or death.
Fifty-six suspected cases of GBS with onset of neurologic 
signs during January 1–July 31, 2016, were identified, includ-
ing one case identified before implementation of GBPSS and

two cases identified during a mid-year assessment of the sur-
veillance system. Among identified suspected cases of GBS, 
20 patients (37%) had no evidence of Zika virus infection, 
two (4%) patients had pending laboratory test results, and 34 
(61%) patients had any evidence of Zika virus or flavivirus 
infection. Among these 34 patients, 10 (18%) had confirmed 
Zika virus infection, 16 (29%) had presumptive Zika virus 
infection, and eight (14%) had presumptive flavivirus infec-
tion. Additionally, one (2%) patient had equivocal results for 
both Zika and dengue virus by IgM ELISA, and three (5%) 
had equivocal results for chikungunya virus by IgM ELISA.
During January–July 2016, the median monthly case count 
of persons with suspected GBS and no evidence of Zika virus 
infection or pending laboratory results, by month of onset of 
neurologic signs, was three (range = 1–5). Overall, the number 
of persons with suspected GBS and evidence of Zika virus or 
flavivirus infection was 2.5 times greater than the number of 
persons with suspected GBS and no evidence of Zika virus infec-
tion, with an increasing number of cases occurring each month 
beginning in April (Figure 1). The 34 patients with suspected 
GBS and evidence of Zika virus or flavivirus infection were 
residents of seven of eight PRDH health regions (Figure 2); the 
median age of these patients was 55 years (range = 21–88 years), 
and 20 (59%) of the 34 patients were female.
Charts have been reviewed for 32 of these 34 patients; GBS was 
confirmed for all 32. Acute illness during the preceding 2 months 
was recorded in the medical charts of 30 (94%) patients (Table). 
The most frequently reported symptoms associated with the 
reported antecedent acute illness were rash (n = 18, 53%), fever 
(n = 12, 35%), and diarrhea (n = 7, 21%). Median interval from 
antecedent acute illness to onset of neurologic signs was 5 days 
(range = 0–17 days). All 34 patients were hospitalized after onset 
of neurologic signs, and among patients who were discharged 
(n = 28) or had died (n = 1) as of August 18, median duration 
of hospitalization was 12 days (range = 6–47 days). Among the 
32 patients with completed chart reviews, the most common 
recorded clinical neurologic signs and symptoms were hypore-
flexia or areflexia (n = 31, 97%), leg weakness (n = 31, 97%), 
leg paresthesia (n = 24, 75%), arm weakness (n = 24, 75%), 
facial weakness (n = 20, 63%), arm numbness (n = 19, 59%), 
and dysphagia (n = 19, 59%). All 25 patients who underwent 
lumbar punctures had cytoalbuminologic dissociation (increased 
CSF protein concentration and total CSF white blood cell count 
<50 cells/µl), which is frequently observed in patients with GBS. 
Five patients had electrophysiologic testing, which indicated the 
acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy subtype of 
GBS in all five. All 34 patients were treated with IVIg. As of 
August 18, 21 (62%) of 34 patients had been admitted to inten-
sive care units, and 12 (35%) required mechanical ventilation. 
As of August 18, five (15%) patients remained hospitalized, 15 
(44%) were discharged home, and 13 (38%) were transferred 
to a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility. One patient (3%) 
with presumptive flavivirus infection died of septic shock, despite 
treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Additionally, 26 cases of neurologic disorders other than 
GBS were reported to PRDH via GBPSS; seven (27%) patients 
had evidence of recent Zika virus or flavivirus infection. The 
neurologic disorders among these seven patients include three 
cases of encephalitis (one patient had confirmed Zika virus 
infection, one had presumptive Zika virus infection, and one 
had presumptive flavivirus infection); two cases of myelitis, 
both in patients with confirmed Zika virus infection; one case 
of acute neurologic deficit, in a patient with confirmed Zika 
virus infection; and one case of postinfectious papilledema, in 
a patient with presumptive Zika virus infection.
Surveillance System Assessment
During July 2016, the surveillance system’s completeness 
in ascertaining suspected cases of GBS was assessed. Thirty-
two (46%) of 70 total hospitals on the island were contacted. 
Hospital staff members from medical records or infection 
control departments were asked to provide a list of patients 
who had been hospitalized during January–June 2016, and who 
had an International Classification of Disease, 10th revision code 
for GBS (G61.0) in their medical record. Unreported cases of 
possible GBS were defined as patients who were hospitalized 
after GBPSS was initiated in mid-February, had hospital stays 
>3 days, and were not reported to GBPSS. Patients with an 
alternative final diagnosis were excluded. Twenty-six (81%) of 
the 32 contacted hospitals responded, including 13 of the 16 
hospitals that reported at least one suspected case of GBS and

13 hospitals from a purposive sample of 16 hospitals selected 
randomly among the remaining hospitals on the island after 
stratifying by hospital size and region.
Two cases of possible GBS that had not been reported 
directly to GBPSS were identified. Both had specimens sub-
mitted to PRDH’s Passive Arboviral Diseases Surveillance 
System shortly before onset of their neurologic illness, which 
confirmed Zika virus infection.¶ The patients were hospitalized 
for GBS in May and June respectively, and GBS diagnosis was 
confirmed by chart review.
Discussion
Because of the increased incidence of GBS reported in coun-
tries affected by Zika virus (7), PRDH implemented GBPSS 
soon after reporting the first case of Zika virus disease (4). 
Timely reporting has allowed for identification of ten cases of 
GBS with Zika virus infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Before 
this report, only individual cases of confirmed Zika virus infec-
tion in patients with GBS have been described (8). Cases of 
GBS with evidence of flavivirus infection are expected to be 
attributable to Zika virus, the predominant flavivirus currently 
circulating in Puerto Rico; during November 1, 2015–July 7, 
2016, PRDH identified 5,582 confirmed and presumptive 
Zika virus cases compared with only 136 cases of dengue virus 
infections (5). Although fatalities among GBS patients are rare 
(1), the potential severity and burden of GBS on the health 
care system are highlighted by the death described here and 
by the large proportion of patients that required intensive care 
services, including mechanical ventilation.
Consistent with the global epidemiology of GBS, the median 
age of patients with suspected GBS and evidence of Zika 
virus or flavivirus infection was >50 years (9). Although GBS 
generally occurs somewhat more frequently in men than in 
women (9), the majority of patients described in this report 
were females. Analyses to explore the unexpected distribution 
of cases by sex are planned, including an apparent predomi-
nance of women in Puerto Rico with Zika virus infections. 
Although provider outreach activities and GBS case clustering 
might partially explain increased monthly case counts during 
April–July, an increased number of cases is consistent with 
ongoing Zika virus transmission. In French Polynesia, where 
a Zika virus disease outbreak occurred during 2013–2014, 
an increase in the number of GBS patients was reported (7). 
In contrast to French Polynesia, where electrophysiologic 
studies (when performed) identified the acute motor axonal 
neuropathy subtype of GBS (7), in Puerto Rico, the acute 
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy subtype of GBS 
was identified in all five GBS cases with evidence of Zika virus 
or flavivirus infection who had electrophysiologic studies 
performed. Consistent with other reports that have found a 
range of neurologic conditions potentially associated with Zika 
virus infection (10), 27% of the 26 patients with neurologic 
conditions other than GBS identified through the GBPSS had 
evidence of Zika virus or flavivirus infection.
Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico and countries 
with ongoing Zika virus transmission should follow recom-
mendations for prevention of Zika virus infections. Given

the potential increase in GBS incidence during ongoing Zika 
virus transmission, health care providers in areas with ongoing 
local transmission should be familiar with the clinical features 
of GBS to ensure timely patient diagnosis and treatment. 
Patients with signs and symptoms consistent with GBS should 
seek medical attention, regardless of antecedent illness. Health 
care providers should report suspected cases of GBS and other 
neurologic conditions to public health authorities.**

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon autoimmune 
disorder characterized by varying degrees of weakness, sensory 
abnormalities, and autonomic dysfunction due to peripheral 
nerve or nerve root damage. Countries affected by Zika virus 
have reported increased numbers of cases of GBS. After identifi-
cation of local transmission of Zika virus in Puerto Rico in 
December 2015, the Puerto Rico Department of Health imple-
mented the GBS Passive Surveillance System in February 2016.
What is added by this report?
Among 56 patients with suspected GBS who had onset of 
neurologic symptoms during January 1–July 31, 2016, 
evidence of Zika or other flavivirus infection was present in 34 
(61%), including 10 (18%) with confirmed Zika virus infection. 
The median age of the 34 patients was 55 years, and 59% were 
female. Thirty (88%) patients reported an acute illness before 
developing neurologic symptoms, with median time to onset 
of neurologic symptoms of 5 days. One patient died from 
septic shock after treatment for GBS. Additionally, evidence of 
Zika virus or flavivirus infection was detected in seven patients 
with neurologic disorders other than GBS.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Persons with signs or symptoms consistent with GBS should 
promptly seek medical attention. Health care providers who 
evaluate patients with neurologic illnesses should consider GBS 
and report suspected cases to public health authorities. Residents 
of and travelers to Puerto Rico are advised to follow existing 
recommendations for prevention of Zika virus infection.
