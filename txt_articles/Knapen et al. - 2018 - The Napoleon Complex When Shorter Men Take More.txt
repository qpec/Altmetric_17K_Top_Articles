When a military commander told Napoleon Bonaparte 
that he felt uncomfortable being so much taller than 
his Emperor, Napoleon allegedly replied: “You may be 
taller, but I am greater” (Donker & Burmanje, 2012, 
 
p. 53).1 This story exemplifies the popular belief, known 
as the Napoleon complex, that short men compensate 
behaviorally for a height disadvantage. The origins of the 
Napoleon complex are unclear but have been attributed 
to Alfred Adler’s (1956) inferiority complex theory, which 
assumes that individuals respond to feelings of inferiority 
on certain traits by overcompensating on others.
Evolutionary psychology may offer a framework for 
examining whether the Napoleon complex has a sci-
entific basis. Sexual selection theory suggests that an 
individual’s physiology and psychology have been 
shaped by the joint forces of intersexual and intrasexual 
competition (e.g., Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Puts, 2010), 
which is also expected to apply to men’s height. Tallness 
increases the ability to attract a potential mate (e.g., 
Stulp, Buunk, & Pollet, 2013)—an example of intersexual 
selection, in which certain traits make individuals more 
successful at attracting mates (and producing offspring) 
than others. Intrasexual selection—competing with rivals 
for mates—occurs (partially) on male physical character-
istics, such as strength and size, that enable success in 
combat with other males (Sell, Hone, & Pound, 2012). 
Taller males indeed have a higher chance of winning 
physical contests (Archer & Thanzami, 2007). In the current 
research, we focused on intrasexual competition, examin-
ing dyadic male–male contest behaviors in line with a 
Napoleon complex.
Height, Status, and Competition
Taller men enjoy several advantages over shorter men, 
such as a higher social standing in the workplace (e.g.,

Abstract
Inspired by an evolutionary psychological perspective on the Napoleon complex, we hypothesized that shorter males 
are more likely to show indirect aggression in resource competitions with taller males. Three studies provide support 
for our interpretation of the Napoleon complex. Our pilot study shows that men (but not women) keep more resources 
for themselves when they feel small. When paired with a taller male opponent (Study 1), shorter men keep more 
resources to themselves in a game in which they have all the power (dictator game) versus a game in which the 
opponent also has some power (ultimatum game). Furthermore, shorter men are not more likely to show direct, 
physical aggression toward a taller opponent (Study 2). As predicted by the Napoleon complex, we conclude that 
(relatively) shorter men show greater behavioral flexibility in securing resources when presented with cues that they 
are physically less competitive. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Gawley, Perks, & Curtis, 2009), and are typically healthier 
and better educated (e.g., Silventoinen, Lahelma, & 
Rahkonen, 1999). Several studies across different cultures 
have found an association between a relatively tall stature 
and holding a position of power (Handwerker & Crosbie, 
1982; Werner, 1982). Ellis (1994a) found, on the basis of 
160 studies from preindustrial and industrial societies, a 
height–status association in humans across multiple cul-
tures, principally for adult men. This height–status asso-
ciation remained after controlling for factors such as 
nutrition and intelligence (Ellis, 1994b; Persico, Postle-
waite, & Silverman, 2004; Silventoinen et al., 1999). Status 
is also embodied in stature. Men feel taller when assigned 
to a high-status position (Duguid & Goncalo, 2012), and 
tall men are seen as having higher status (Blaker et al., 
2013; Jackson & Ervin, 1992). For women, the height–
status association is either weaker or nonexistent in most 
reported studies (e.g., Blaker et al., 2013; Gawley et al., 
2009; however, see Handwerker & Crosbie, 1982).
Height, together with muscularity, represents men’s 
physical formidability, increasing their perceived com-
petitive fighting ability against other males (e.g., Fessler, 
Holbrook, & Snyder, 2012). For instance, height was 
positively related to dominant behavior in a sample of 
Western men (Stulp, Buunk, Verhulst, & Pollet, 2015). 
However, it is unclear whether height or physical strength 
better predicts competitive ability: Strength is often not 
measured (Handwerker & Crosbie, 1982; Werner, 1982) 
or not mentioned in previous studies (Ellis, 1994a), and 
studies that measured both height and strength resulted 
in mixed findings (for a more detailed description, see 
Section 1 in the Supplemental Material available online). 
Archer and Thanzami (2007) suggest that height is a 
stronger predictor of competitive ability, while Sell et al. 
(2009) and von Rueden, Gurven, and Kaplan (2008) sug-
gest that strength is the main predictor. Recent research 
showed that cues of physical formidability—both height 
and strength—lead to increased status allocation, presum-
ably because people use formidability as a cue to specific 
leadership abilities (Lukaszewski, Simmons, Anderson, & 
Roney, 2016). Because we focused on the Napoleon com-
plex, our studies concerned the impact of height, not 
strength, on competitive male–male interactions.
The Napoleon Complex
It has been argued that men have a flexible status psy-
chology that allows them to calibrate their behavior to 
opportunities in the environment for status enhance-
ment (van Vugt & Tybur, 2015). Thus, being shorter and 
less formidable than a competitor should alter the 
trade-offs associated with various physical and non-
physical strategies to compete. We hypothesized that—
recognizing a situation in which they are physically 
outcompeted—shorter males will turn to alternative 
strategies to win contests (i.e., exercise behavioral flex-
ibility; Zaccaro, Gilbert, Thor, & Mumford, 1991). Though 
there are many examples of such alternative strategies 
(forming coalitions, deception), for this first investigation 
into a potential Napoleon complex we examined whether 
shorter males behave more indirectly aggressively toward 
a taller opponent (i.e., by disadvantaging them in a non-
physical way). Indirect forms of aggression to disadvan-
tage opponents entail, for instance, gossiping or securing 
resources in an unobtrusive manner (Archer & Coyne, 
2005; Cummins, 2006) and, unlike direct aggression, 
pose no or limited physical risk to the aggressor—they 
are the safer option (Campbell, 1999).
The current research examined the Napoleon com-
plex hypothesis in settings in which male dyads com-
pete with each other over resources in economic games. 
We expected that shorter men would behave more indi-
rectly aggressively by taking valuable resources from a 
taller opponent. We predicted that this Napoleon com-
plex psychology would be activated under the follow-
ing conditions: (a) Men are competing for resources 
intrasexually, (b) shorter men are paired with taller 
rivals, (c) the height difference is salient and internal-
ized, and (d) the costs of disadvantaging the opponent 
through indirect aggression are reasonably low (e.g., 
without risk of retaliation or physical aggression).
Overview of Studies
We first present a pilot study, which formed the motiva-
tion to conduct our two main studies. Then, in Study 
1, we tested our predictions by comparing behavior in 
a dictator game versus an ultimatum game. In the dicta-
tor game, one player has unconditional power over 
resource allocation, while in the ultimatum game, that 
player’s allocation decision can be rejected—thus pos-
ing a risk of retaliation by the opponent. The main 
expectation is that shorter men take more resources in 
the dictator game but not necessarily in the ultimatum 
game. Economic games can be used to mimic actual 
resource contests (Cummins, 2006), as individuals tend 
to behave in these economic games as if they are in 
real physical encounters (Van Lange, Joireman, Parks, 
& Van Dijk, 2013). Participants meet each other in dyads 
before the game to get a sense of relative height dif-
ferences, which should activate a Napoleon complex 
psychology among the shorter men. To increase the 
competitiveness of the games, the allocators can take 
the money—rather than give it away—and the leftovers 
will automatically go to their opponent (Bardsley, 
2008). In Study 2, we tested how height affects indirect 
aggressive behavior (dictator game) and physical 
aggression (hot-sauce task; Lieberman, Solomon, 
 1136 
Knapen et al.
Greenberg, & McGregor, 1999) and expected that 
shorter men would be more indirectly aggressive, but 
not more physically aggressive, than tall men.
Pilot Study
Method
Sixty participants (43 women) took part in a study at the 
University of Groningen (age: M = 20.90 years, SD = 2.18 
years). They were paid €2, plus what they decided to 
take home from the dictator game. The independent 
measures were “Did you ever feel small?” which was 
measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = never, 7 = often; 
M = 2.55, SD = 1.79); self-reported height in centimeters 
(males: M = 187.65 cm, SD = 6.68 cm; females: M = 
173.05 cm, SD = 6.19 cm); and participant sex. The main 
dependent measure was the number of €1 coins left 
behind in the dictator game for other people (M = 2.68, 
SD = 1.88).
Participants were led into a cubicle and read all 
instructions on paper. They completed a paper-and-
pencil questionnaire with sociodemographic questions, 
including the measures on their height, and read the 
instructions for the dictator game. The money for the 
dictator game, in coins, was placed in an envelope. 
Participants read in the instructions that the envelope 
contained eight €1 coins and that they could choose to 
leave behind as many coins as they would like and that 
we would give away what they left behind to someone 
else (a participant like them in the study or a person 
on campus—they did not know the identity of the 
recipient). They were instructed to seal the envelope 
and leave it behind in the experimental room. There 
was no deception, and the money was allocated to 
either other participants or people on campus. After 
completing the study, all participants were thanked and 
debriefed via e-mail.
Results
We tested the effect of participant height (in centimeters) 
and feeling small on the number of coins given away in 
the dictator game (with a constant of 1 added to avoid 
values of 0) with a generalized linear model with a Pois-
son distribution (corrected for overdispersion in SPSS 
Version 23). Because of the modest correlation between 
self-reported height and feeling small (r = .365, p = .004), 
separate analyses were run for these two predictors. 
Also, participant sex was added to each model, along 
with the interactions between sex and height and 
between sex and feeling small, as we expected to mainly 
find an effect among male participants.
There was a significant effect of feeling small on the 
number of coins given away in the dictator game, Wald 
χ2(1) = 4.85, p = .028, while participant sex did not 
predict coin allocation, Wald χ2(1) = .18, p = .673. Fur-
thermore, there was a significant interaction between 
participant sex and feeling small on coin allocation, 
Wald χ2(1) = 4.83, p = .028. Parameter estimates showed 
that feeling small led to a decrease in coins allocated to 
other people for male participants, Wald χ2(1) = 6.20, b = 
−0.161, SE = 0.065, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [−0.288, 
−0.034], p = .013, but not for female participants, Wald 
χ2(1) < .001, b < 0.001, SE = 0.034, 95% CI = [−0.068, 0.067], 
p = .996. Applying a bootstrapping procedure (1,000 
resam 
ples, 95% CI bias-corrected and accelerated) cor-
roborated the finding that male participants who felt 
smaller gave away fewer coins, b = −0.161, SE = 0.085, 
95% CI = [−0.315, −0.011], p = .029 (Fig. 1).
Self-reported height in centimeters (absolute height) 
did not predict coin allocation, Wald χ2(1) = 0.06, p = 
.939 (controlling for participant sex, Wald χ2(1) = 0.32, 
p = .570). There was also no interaction between par-
ticipant sex and absolute height on coin allocation in 
the dictator game, Wald χ2(1) = 0.27, p = .602.
This pilot study thus established that feeling small 
significantly affected men’s allocations in the dictator 
game (but not women’s). We did not find an effect of 
absolute height on resource allocation in the dictator 
game. However, there was no competitive context; the 
dictator game was played with an anonymous other, 
and opponent height or relative height was not included 
in the design of the pilot study. Therefore, in Study 1,

we examined the effects of own and opponent stature 
in a dyadic male–male competitive context and manipu-
lated the possibility of retaliation by the opponent.
Study 1
Method
The data-collection strategy for Study 1 was to get as 
many participants as possible within the 2 weeks the 
lab was available for this project. Forty-two male par-
ticipants (age: M = 23.02 years, SD = 2.98 years; height: 
M = 182.98 cm, SD = 6.79 cm) completed the study at 
the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in return for €5 or 
course credits (excluding a bonus for playing economic 
games). Participants were paired up during the study 
(21 dyads; all pairs were strangers) with an “opponent.” 
The independent variables in the main model were 
participants’ own height in centimeters and their oppo-
nent’s height in centimeters. An additional model con-
sidered the participants’ relative height in centimeters 
(participant’s height – opponent’s height). The main 
dependent variables were the number of coins (out of 
18) participants kept for themselves in a dictator game 
(M = 12.62, SD = 4.05) and the number of coins (also out 
of 18) participants kept for themselves in an ultimatum 
game (M = 10.24, SD = 1.91). Also, the difference in 
coins kept for self in the two games was calculated as 
an additional dependent variable (coins kept for self in 
the dictator game – coins kept for self in the ultimatum 
game). The “coins” that participants played the eco-
nomic games with in this study were poker chips worth 
€0.10 each.
In each session, 2 male participants stood opposite 
each other for approximately 10 s, were introduced as 
each other’s opponent, and then led off to separate 
cubicles for the duration of the study. Participants first 
played a one-shot dictator game followed by a one-shot 
ultimatum game, in which they divided 18 coins in each 
game. Although participants were told they were cho-
sen to divide the money between themselves and their 
opponent during the games, both participants were 
actually given the allocator role. When making deci-
sions for the ultimatum game, participants did not know 
that their opponent had allocated them money in the 
dictator game. Participants were told their opponent 
would leave the lab separately following the study. The 
games were framed in a “taking” rather than a “giving” 
way; participants were told the money was theirs to 
take, and the leftovers would automatically go to the 
opponent (see Bardsley, 2008). In the dictator game, 
participants could anonymously take as many coins as 
they wanted without consequences, while in the ulti-
matum game the opponent had the opportunity to see 
how much was taken by the other and accept or reject 
the division (in the case of rejection, both participants 
were left with nothing). Participants also filled out 
demographic information, including their height in cen-
timeters, as well as age and self-reported socioeco-
nomic status (SES; α = .62, as used by Griskevicius, 
Tybur, Delton, & Robertson, 2011). Finally, participants 
were debriefed and paid.
Results
For the specific syntax used for Studies 1 and 2, see 
Section 2 of the Supplemental Material. We used gen-
eralized estimating equations (GEEs; in SPSS Statistics 
Version 23) to analyze all data in Studies 1 and 2, which 
enabled us to take the dyadic structure of the data into 
account and specify a Poisson log-linear (for the eco-
nomic games, always corrected for overdispersion) or 
a normal distribution. The independent variables were 
added to the model as fixed effects one at a time, and 
both parameter estimates and an indicator of model fit 
(corrected quasi-information criterion, or QICc) are 
reported. Lower QICc values indicate superior model 
fit (see Pan, 2001). Note that the participant and oppo-
nent height variables were not independent from the 
relative height variable and were thus never included 
in the same model. Participant height significantly cor-
related with SES, r = .33, p = .031, indicating that taller 
participants had higher SES. If a height variable had a 
significant effect on behavior in either economic game, 
we repeated the analysis with SES as a covariate.
Dictator game. We reverse-scored the dependent vari-
able (number of coins kept for self in the dictator game) 
and added a constant (1) in order to better fit a Poisson 
distribution and to avoid values of zero. QICc values in 
this section represent the model fit after adding the men-
tioned independent variable as a fixed effect (unless 
explained otherwise) and should be compared with the 
intercept-only model (QICc = 124.63) or each other.
Participant height was added as a fixed factor, which 
had a significant effect on coins kept for self in the 
dictator game, Wald χ2(1) = 7.03, b = 0.025, SE = 0.009, 
95% CI = [0.007, 0.044], p = .008 (QICc = 117.00), indi-
cating that shorter participants kept more coins for 
themselves (see Fig. 2). Opponent height was then 
added to the model but had no significant effect on 
coins kept for self in the dictator game, Wald χ2(1) = 
1.61, b = −0.016, SE = 0.013, 95% CI = [−0.041, 0.009], 
p = .205 (QICc = 115.84). Participant height remained 
a significant predictor after controlling for opponent 
height and SES, Wald χ2(1) = 5.42, b = 0.027, SE = 0.012, 
95% CI = [0.004, 0.050], p = .020. SES was not signifi-
cantly related to behavior in the dictator game, Wald 
 1138 
Knapen et al.
χ2(1) = 0.61, b = 0.092, SE = 0.118, 95% CI = [−0.139, 
0.323], p = .436. Finally, there was no significant inter-
action between absolute height and opponent height, 
Wald χ2(1) = 0.13, b = 0.001, SE = 0.001, 95% CI = 
[−0.002, 0.003], p = .718 (QICc = 117.75). Thus, shorter 
participants (regardless of their opponent’s height) kept 
more coins for themselves in the dictator game.
Adding relative height as a predictor to the intercept-
only model showed that the shorter a participant was 
compared with his opponent, the more coins he kept for 
himself in the dictator game, Wald χ2(1) = 5.58, b = 0.023, 
SE = 0.010, 95% CI = [0.004, 0.042], p = .018 (QICc = 
114.75). The relative-height model showed the best 
model fit (lowest QICc value), but the effect of relative 
height was likely driven largely by participants’ own 
height, considering the separate effects of own and oppo-
nent height.
Ultimatum game. Of the 42 ultimatum game offers, 7 
were rejected and 35 were accepted. We transformed 
number of coins kept for self in the ultimatum game in 
the same manner as coins kept for self in the dictator 
game (reverse-coded, plus a constant of 1). The QICc 
values of the models reported in this section can be com-
pared with those obtained from the intercept-only model 
(QICc = 21.63) or with each other.
Participant height (added as a fixed effect to the intercept-
only model) had a marginally significant effect on coins 
kept for self in the ultimatum game, Wald χ2(1) = 3.53, 
b = 0.005, SE = 0.003, 95% CI = [< 0.001, 0.011], 
 
p = .060 (QICc = 22.93), suggesting a trend in which 
shorter participants kept more coins for themselves. 
Opponent height was subsequently added as a fixed 
effect, which was not significantly related to number of 
coins kept for self in the ultimatum game, Wald χ2(1) = 
1.54, b = 0.004, SE = 0.003, 95% CI = [−0.002, 0.011], p = 
.215 (QICc = 24.62). The effect of participant height was 
significant when we controlled for opponent height and 
SES, Wald χ2(1) = 8.20, b = 0.008, SE = 0.003, 95% CI = 
[0.003, 0.014], p = .004. SES was not significantly related to 
coins kept for self in the ultimatum game, Wald χ2(1) = 
2.41, b = −0.062, SE = 0.040, 95% CI = [−0.141, 0.016], p = 
.121 (QICc = 26.23).
We tested the interaction between participant height 
and opponent height by adding the interaction term as 
a fixed effect to the model with participant height and 
opponent height as predictors (mean centered). There 
was a marginally significant interaction between par-
ticipant height and opponent height on coins kept for 
self in the ultimatum game, Wald χ2(1) = 3.83, b = 
−0.001, SE = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.002, < 0.001], p = .051 
(QICc = 26.16). Simple effects showed that when par-
ticipants’ opponents were shorter than average (1 SD 
below the mean), shorter participants kept more coins 
for themselves in the ultimatum game, b = 0.014, SE = 
0.005, 95% CI = [0.004, 0.023], p = .005. However, 
shorter participants did not keep more coins for them-
selves in the ultimatum game when their opponent was 
taller than average (1 SD above the mean), b = 0.001, 
SE = 0.004, 95% CI = [−0.007, 0.009], p = .846.
Finally, we added relative height as a fixed factor to 
the intercept-only model, which showed that there was 
no significant relationship between relative height and 
coins kept for self in the ultimatum game, Wald χ2(1) = 
0.42, b = 0.001, SE = 0.002, 95% CI = [−0.002, 0.005], 
 
p = .519 (QICc = 23.58). Like in the dictator game, 
shorter males kept more coins for themselves in an 
ultimatum game. However, their opponent’s height may 
also play a role in the decision-making process.
Dictator versus ultimatum game. To test whether 
there was a significant effect of height on the different 
actions of participants in the two economic games, we 
repeated our analyses with the amount of extra coins that 
each participant kept in the dictator game compared with 
the ultimatum game as the dependent variable (z score 
of coins kept in dictator game – z score of coins kept in 
ultimatum game). On average, participants kept more 
coins to themselves in the dictator game compared with 
the ultimatum game (mean difference = 2.38, SD = 3.42). 
The same GEE procedure as before was used, taking into 
account the dyadic structure of the data, except instead 
of a Poisson log-linear distribution a normal distribution 
was specified, and standardized variables were used. The 
QICc values in this section should be compared with

Participant height was added as a fixed effect to the 
intercept-only model. Participant height had no signifi-
cant effect on selfish behavior in the dictator game 
compared with the ultimatum game, Wald χ2(1) = 0.66, 
b = −0.100, SE = 0.123, 95% CI = [−0.341, 0.141], p = 
.417 (QICc = 41.22). Subsequently, opponent height 
was added to the participant-height model. There was 
a significant effect of opponent height, indicating that 
participants kept more coins for themselves in the dicta-
tor game compared with the ultimatum game when 
their opponent was taller, Wald χ2(1) = 6.06, b = 0.300, 
SE = 0.122, 95% CI = [0.061, 0.539], p = .014 (QICc = 
39.54; with opponent height as the only fixed effect, 
QICc = 39.05). The effect of opponent height remained 
significant after we controlled for SES (and participant 
height), Wald χ2(1) = 7.19, b = 0.316, SE = 0.118, 95% 
CI = [0.085, 0.547], p = .007 (QICc = 40.35). SES was 
marginally significantly related to coins kept for self in 
the dictator game versus the ultimatum game, Wald 
χ2(1) = 3.09, b = −0.182, SE = 0.103, 95% CI = [−0.384, 
0.021], p = .079, suggesting a trend in which participants 
with lower SES keep more coins to themselves in the 
dictator game versus the ultimatum game. Finally, there 
was no significant interaction between participant 
height and opponent height, Wald χ2(1) = 1.75, b = 
−0.193, SE = 0.146, 95% CI = [−0.479, 0.093], p = .186 
(QICc = 40.50).
We tested the effect of relative height by adding it 
as a fixed effect to the intercept-only model. The shorter 
participants were compared with their opponent, the 
more coins they kept for themselves in the dictator game 
compared with the ultimatum game, Wald χ2(1) = 5.40, 
b = −0.281, SE = 0.121, 95% CI = [−0.518, −0.044], p = 
.020 (QICc = 38.39).
Results showed that shorter participants kept more 
coins to themselves in a dictator game, regardless of 
their opponent’s height. Though relatively shorter par-
ticipants also kept more coins for themselves, this effect 
was likely strongly driven by their own height. In the 
ultimatum game, shorter participants kept more money 
to themselves, but not when their opponent was taller 
than average. On average, participants kept more coins 
for themselves in the dictator game compared with the 
ultimatum game. The taller the opponent, the more 
coins participants kept for themselves in the dictator 
game compared with the ultimatum game. Participant 
height had a similar effect in the two economic games, 
but opponent height was more important in the ulti-
matum game than in the dictator game. In Study 2, we 
looked at behavior in the dictator game with a larger 
sample and added a measure involving direct, physical 
aggression (the hot-sauce task; Lieberman et al., 1999).
Study 2
Method
For Study 2, we set a goal to recruit 80 pairs of men. 
One hundred sixty-four participants (82 pairs of men) 
took part in the study, and data were collected in three 
waves—in April 2012, April 2013, and April 2014. See 
Section 3 of the Supplemental Material for more infor-
mation on data collection. Participants (age: M = 22.02 
years, SD = 2.72 years; height: M = 182.42 cm, SD = 
8.03 cm) were recruited at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam 
and via the contacts of students involved in the project 
for their thesis. The study was conducted with pairs of 
male participants who acted as each other’s opponents 
and who did not know each other. Participant height 
in centimeters and opponent height in centimeters were 
the main independent variables, and relative height was 
again an additional independent variable (participant 
height – opponent height). The main dependent vari-
ables were the number of coins kept for self in the 
dictator game and (noninstrumental) direct aggression, 
as measured by the amount of hot sauce allocated to 
the opponent in a hot-sauce task (see Lieberman et al., 
1999).
As in Study 1, participants were brought into the lab 
in pairs, stood opposite each other for several seconds, 
and were told that the other participant was their oppo-
nent. Height in centimeters was then measured with a 
stadiometer (a medical height-measurement device) and 
read aloud to ensure that any height differences were 
known and salient to the participants. Next, participants 
were seated in separate closed cubicles and were assured 
that they would not meet the opponent face to face 
again. Other physical measures were taken to mask the 
importance of height and to boost a sense of competi-
tion. Handgrip strength was measured in the cubicle with 
a hand dynamometer (the result was not read aloud or 
included in the study because of a defective hand dyna-
mometer), and an experimenter took a photo of partici-
pants’ faces. In the cubicle, participants first completed 
some sociodemographic questions (also including the 
question “Do you ever feel small?”) and then proceeded 
to participate in a dictator game and a hot-sauce alloca-
tion task (order of the tasks was counterbalanced).
The procedure of the dictator game was identical to 
that of the dictator game in Study 1, except that partici-
pants now divided 15 coins (instead of 18). The “coins” 
in this dictator game were again poker chips worth 
€0.10 each. The hot-sauce task was adapted from 
Lieberman et al. (1999). Participants were told this was 
a “taste test,” in which they would prepare a food sam-
ple for their opponent. Participants inserted (with a 
syringe) an amount of hot sauce between 0 and 5 ml 
into a small cup of water for their opponent to drink. 
 1140 
Knapen et al.
A larger amount of hot sauce indicated higher levels of 
aggression toward the other person. Note that the origi-
nal hot-sauce paradigm was designed to be a measure 
of reactionary aggression, but in this study, participants 
gave the hot sauce in response to no particular trans-
gression. However, the competitive atmosphere created 
(by being branded opponents) could create a similar 
effect (e.g., Adachi & Willoughby, 2011).
Results
An independent-samples t test showed that participants 
who reported a non-Caucasian ethnicity were signifi-
cantly shorter (M = 178.41 cm, SD = 9.59 cm) than the 
Caucasian participants (M = 183.98 cm, SD = 6.76 cm), 
t(63.18) = 4.19, p = .001. If a height variable had a sig-
nificant effect on behavior in the dictator game or the 
hot-sauce task, we tested its robustness by repeating 
the analysis with participant ethnicity as a covariate. As 
with Study 1, relative height was always tested in a 
separate model to absolute and opponent height.
Dictator game. To analyze height effects on behavior 
in the dictator game, we used GEE (Poisson log-linear 
distribution, corrected for overdispersion, dyadic struc-
ture specified—see Section 2 of the Supplemental Mate-
rial for syntax), adding one fixed effect at a time. The 
dependent variable (coins kept for self in the dictator 
game) was reverse-coded, and a constant (1) was added 
to better fit a Poisson distribution. The model-fit values 
reported in this section can be compared with those 
obtained from the intercept-only model (QICc = 331.15) 
and with each other.
In line with Study 1, participant height had a signifi-
cant effect on coins kept for self in the dictator game, 
Wald χ2(1) = 4.38, b = 0.009, SE = 0.004, 95% CI = [0.001, 
0.018], p = .036 (QICc = 326.18), indicating that shorter 
participants kept more coins for themselves in the dicta-
tor game (see Fig. 3). Opponent height was then added 
to the model. Opponent height did not significantly 
affect coins kept for self in the dictator game, Wald 
χ2(1) = 1.34, b = −0.006, SE = 0.005, 95% CI = [−0.015, 
0.004], p = .247 (QICc = 325.85). The effect of partici-
pant height remained significant after controlling for 
ethnicity and opponent height, Wald χ2(1) = 4.27, b = 0.010, 
SE = 0.005, 95% CI = [0.001, 0.019], p = .039 (QICc = 
327.06), and ethnicity was not significantly related to 
behavior in the dictator game, Wald χ2(1) = 0.37, b = 
−0.064, SE = 0.106, 95% CI = [−0.272, 0.143], p = .542. 
Subsequently, we added the interaction term to the 
model with participant height and opponent height as 
fixed effects, which was not significant, Wald χ2(1) = 
1.00, b = −0.001, SE = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.002, 0.001], 
p = .317 (QICc = 326.51).
Next, we added relative height as a fixed effect to 
the intercept-only model. Results showed that a shorter 
relative height was related to more coins kept for self 
in the dictator game, Wald χ2(1) = 5.03, b = 0.008, 
 
SE = 0.004, 95% CI = [0.001, 0.015], p = .025 (QICc = 
324.90). The relative-height model showed the best fit 
(lowest QICc), but its effect was likely driven more by 
participants’ own height than the opponent’s height, 
considering their separate effects. Finally, the effect of 
feeling small was tested by adding the variable to the 
intercept-only model—feeling small was not signifi-
cantly related to behavior in the dictator game, Wald 
χ2(1) = 0.08, b = −0.006, SE = 0.022, 95% CI = [−0.050, 
0.037], p = .781 (QICc = 333.06).
Hot-sauce allocation task. To analyze height effects 
on behavior in the hot-sauce task, we used GEE (normal 
distribution, dyadic structure specified, standardized vari-
ables). The QICc values in this section can be compared 
with those obtained from the intercept-only model (QICc = 
165.00) and with each other. First, participant height 
(added as a fixed factor to the intercept-only model) had 
no effect on aggressive behavior, Wald χ2(1) = 0.10, b = 
−0.024, SE = 0.074, 95% CI = [−0.169, 0.122], p = .749 
(QICc = 166.91). Opponent height was then added as a 
fixed factor, which also did not have a significant effect 
on aggressive behavior, Wald χ2(1) = 2.36, b = −0.117, 
 
SE = 0.076, 95% CI = [−0.266, 0.032], p = .125 (QICc = 
166.77). The interaction term was added, which showed 
there was no interaction effect between participant and 
opponent height on aggressive behavior in the hot-sauce 
task, Wald χ2(1) = 0.58, b = 0.070, SE = 0.092, 95% CI = 
0

[−0.110, 0.249], p = .446 (QICc = 168.10). Additionally, 
feeling small (added as a fixed factor to the intercept-
only model) was not significantly related to behavior in 
the hot-sauce task, Wald χ2(1) = 0.63, b = −0.020, SE = 
0.078, 95% CI = [−0.172, 0.133], p = .802 (QICc = 166.94). 
Finally, there was no effect of relative height (added as a 
fixed factor to the intercept-only model), Wald χ2(1) = 
1.45, b = 0.074, SE = 0.061, 95% CI = [−0.046, 0.193], p = 
.228 (QICc = 166.12).
Replicating the results of Study 1, Study 2 showed 
that shorter participants kept more coins for themselves 
in a dictator game. Again, opponent height did not 
significantly affect resource allocation in the dictator 
game. Shorter relative height was also significantly 
related to keeping more coins in the dictator game, 
though this was expected to be mainly driven by the 
effect of participant height. Feeling small had no effect 
on behavior in the dictator game. None of the height 
variables were significantly related to physically aggres-
sive behavior in the hot-sauce task.
Studies 1 and 2: Combined Data Analysis
We also investigated the effect of height on behavior 
in the dictator game by combining the data from Studies 
1 and 2. The independent variables were participant 
height, opponent height, and relative height. The 
dependent variable was the percentage of coins kept 
for self in the dictator game (maximum number of coins 
to keep was 18 for Study 1 and 15 for Study 2). As 
before, we used GEE (normal distribution, dyadic struc-
ture specified, standardized variables) to analyze the 
data. Model-fit statistics in this section should be com-
pared with each other and with those obtained from 
the intercept-only model (QICc = 207.00).
First, we added participant height as a fixed factor, 
which showed that shorter participants kept more coins 
for themselves, Wald χ2(1) = 7.83, b = −0.174, SE = 
0.062, 95% CI = [−0.295, −0.052], p = .005 (QICc = 
202.82). Subsequently, opponent height was added to 
the model, which was marginally significantly related 
to percentage of coins kept for self in the dictator 
games, Wald χ2(1) = 2.81, b = 0.116, SE = 0.069, 95% 
 
CI = [−0.020, 0.251], p = .094 (QICc = 202.15). This result 
indicates a trend in which participants kept a higher 
percentage of coins for themselves when faced with a 
taller opponent. Participant height remained a signifi-
cant predictor after we controlled for opponent height, 
Wald χ2(1) = 9.69, b = −0.193, SE = 0.062, 95% CI = 
[−0.315, −0.072], p = .002. There was no significant 
interaction between participant height and opponent 
height, Wald χ2(1) = 0.38, b = 0.042, SE = 0.068, 95% 
 
CI = [−0.091, 0.174], p = .540 (QICc = 203.85). Finally, 
we added relative height as a fixed effect to the 
intercept-only model, which showed that relatively 
shorter participants kept a higher percentage of coins 
to themselves in the dictator games, Wald χ2(1) = 9.33, 
b = −0.202, SE = 0.066, 95% CI = [−0.332, −0.072], p = 
.002 (QICc = 200.67).
Discussion
Across three studies, we found preliminary support for 
the Napoleon complex—the idea that short men com-
pensate behaviorally in dyadic intrasexual competitions 
with taller rivals by behaving more indirectly aggres-
sively in resource contests. The pilot study showed that 
feeling small, but not actual shorter height, was related 
to keeping more resources in an anonymous dictator 
game. These results were not replicated in the main 
studies, possibly because the actual presence of a taller 
opponent overruled the main effect of “feeling small.” 
Studies 1 and 2 showed that (relatively) shorter men 
took more resources in a dictator game, suggesting that 
shorter males are more likely to adopt alternative com-
petitive strategies such as indirect aggression. Study 2 
also showed that (relatively) shorter men did not 
behave with more direct physical aggression in the 
hot-sauce task, suggesting that shorter males are not more 
aggressive generally. In Study 1, opponent height did not 
affect resource allocation in the dictator game, but having 
a taller opponent was related to taking more resources 
in the dictator game (allocator has unconditional power) 
compared with the ultimatum game (allocator has con-
ditional power, opponent can retaliate). Shorter men also 
kept more coins for themselves in the ultimatum game, 
but not when their opponent was taller than average—
note that men who were relatively shorter than their 
opponent did not take more resources in the ultimatum 
game, this was an effect only of participant height.
The results imply that participant height is most 
important in predicting competitive behaviors in an 
absolute-power situation (the dictator game), regardless 
of opponent height. This is not surprising as shorter 
and taller men likely have different life experiences that 
may influence their decision making in behavioral 
experiments. In our studies, we used relative differ-
ences in actual height as predictors, which can be seen 
as a strength of our method. Future research could use 
an experimental setup—such as a virtual reality study—
to manipulate experienced height differences indepen-
dently of men’s actual height. A limitation of our 
research is that we did not successfully measure an 
individual’s physical strength—something we suggest 
for future research. The participants in Studies 1 and 2 
faced their opponent, so other cues to formidability, 
such as muscularity (Sell et al., 2009), could have 
affected their decisions. Yet regardless of potential 
 1142 
Knapen et al.
differences in other body features, we still found an 
independent effect of height. Finally, although we 
assume that the ultimatum game is perceived by the 
allocator as involving a risk of physical retaliation, this 
assumption will need to be explicitly tested in future 
research.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine 
the effect of height differences on men’s behaviors in 
a quasi-experimental research paradigm. Beyond look-
ing at physical strength, there are still a few questions 
to answer and possible future studies to conduct. For 
instance, given our current data, we cannot clearly 
establish whether shorter men indeed are more indi-
rectly aggressive or simply less altruistic in same-sex 
encounters with taller rivals. The competitive version 
of the dictator game we used—taking money from the 
opponent—suggests an act of indirect aggression, how-
ever (Bardsley, 2008). Future research with alternative 
paradigms such as a helping task could study the influ-
ence of height in a noncompetitive setting. Additionally, 
a group situation could activate the Napoleon complex 
in different ways. There are alternative strategies to 
physical aggression, such as recruiting allies, gossiping, 
or even showing leadership to enhance one’s social 
reputation. Furthermore, weapons or coalition size 
could compensate for short height (Fessler & Holbrook, 
2013; Fessler et al., 2012). Finally, our current research 
focused entirely on intrasexual competition, but that is 
just one element of sexual selection theory. In terms of 
underlying mechanisms, the Napoleon complex may 
also be shaped by intersexual selection forces—shorter 
men could use behavioral strategies to impress females, 
such as risk taking, generosity, or showing commitment 
(e.g., Griskevicius et al., 2007; Iredale, Van Vugt, & 
Dunbar, 2008). For further studies, it would be of great 
interest to add a potential mating opportunity to the 
paradigm to see how intersexual competition affects 
the Napoleon complex. The presence of an attractive 
female could exacerbate other kinds of overcompensat-
ing behaviors in short men—for example, an increased 
propensity toward risk taking to impress women (e.g., 
Frankenhuis, Dotsch, Karremans, & Wigboldus, 2010).
In summary, our results are among the first to show 
that height differences matter in intrasexual competi-
tions between men. Consistent with predictions from 
sexual selection theory, and in line with the Napoleon 
complex, our results showed that short men kept more 
resources in competitive interactions, using height cues 
to assess the appropriateness of different behavioral 
tactics to take these resources from their male rivals. 
Further research could focus on the development of 
the Napoleon complex in men, perhaps using insights 
from life-history theory.
