Removal of all ovarian tissue versus conserving ovarian tissue 
at time of hysterectomy in premenopausal patients with benign 
disease: study using routine data and data linkage

ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To conduct a nationwide study of associations between 
removal of all ovarian tissue versus conservation of at 
least one ovary at the time of hysterectomy and 
important health outcomes (ischaemic heart disease, 
cancer, and all cause mortality).
Study deSign and Setting
Retrospective analysis of the English Hospital Episode 
Statistics database linked to national registers of 
deprivation indices and of deaths.
PartiCiPantS
113 679 patients aged 35-45 who had had a 
hysterectomy for benign conditions between April 
2004 and March 2014.
exPOSureS
Bilateral ovarian removal versus no removal or 
unilateral ovarian removal (ovarian conservation).
Main OutCOMe MeaSureS
Hospital admissions for ischaemic heart disease, 
cancer, or attempted suicide; deaths, overall and from 
heart disease, cancer, or suicide. Statistical 
adjustments were made using Cox regression and 
propensity score matching for potential confounders.
reSultS
A third of patients had bilateral ovarian removal. 
Patients in the ovarian conservation group were less 
likely to be admitted for ischaemic heart disease after 
hysterectomy than were those in the bilateral removal 
group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence 
interval 0.77 to 0.93; P=0.001). They were also less 
likely to have a cancer related post-hysterectomy 
admission (adjusted hazard ratio 0.83, 0.78 to 0.89; 
P<0.001). A significant difference in all cause mortality 
was also seen: 0.60% (456/76 581) of patients with 
ovarian conservation compared with 1.01% 
(376/37 098) of patients with bilateral removal. Again, 
this difference in favour of ovarian conservation was 
significant (adjusted hazard ratio 0.64, 0.55 to 0.73; 
P<0.001). Fewer deaths related specifically to heart 
disease (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, 0.28 to 0.90; 
P=0.02) and to cancer (0.54, 0.45 to 0.65; P<0.001) 
occurred in the ovarian conservation group than in the 
bilateral removal group. No significant difference 
between groups was found relating to suicide 
(attempted or completed). The results after propensity 
score matching were essentially unchanged.
COnCluSiOn
Patients who had ovarian conservation had a 
significantly lower hazard of all cause mortality 
compared with those who had bilateral ovarian 
removal and also had lower death rates from 
ischaemic heart disease and cancer. Consistent with 
this observation, admissions to hospital for both 
ischaemic heart disease and cancer were also lower in 
the ovarian conservation group than in the bilateral 
removal group. Although removal of both ovaries 
protects against subsequent development of ovarian 
cancer, premenopausal women should be advised that 
this benefit comes at the cost of an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease and of other (more prevalent) 
cancers and higher overall mortality.
Introduction
Strong arguments exist to remove both ovaries at the 
time of hysterectomy in women who have reproductive 
cancers or who have a high risk of developing cancers. 
Cancers of the breast or endometrium are often stimu-
lated by ovarian hormones, and cancer in one ovary 
often spreads to the other. However, many premeno-
pausal women who have no such specific indication 
nevertheless have both healthy ovaries removed at the 
time of hysterectomy as a prophylactic measure to fore-
stall the later development of ovarian cancer. Empirical 
investigations have confirmed the intuitive conclusion 
that such a measure protects against the risk of ovarian 
cancer—the hazard ratio over 28 years’ follow-up was 
0.06 (95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.21) in the large 
Nurses’ Health Study.1  The combination of biological 
plausibility and the massive “effect size” make a com-
pelling case that women can be advised that their risk 
of ovarian cancer is greatly reduced by oophorectomy. 
However, the lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer 
is one in 52 in the UK,2  and the removal of a metaboli-
cally active organ such as the ovary may have harmful 
effects in the long term. If so, these long term disadvan-
tages (combined with the unpleasant shorter term

effects of acute oestrogen deprivation) must be offset 
against the benefit conferred by protection from ovarian 
cancer. This possibility has been investigated in several 
studies, the largest of which is the Nurses’ Health Study, 
in which a cohort of 30 117 participants had a hysterec-
tomy for benign disease.1 
3  All cause mortality, coronary 
heart disease mortality, and deaths from all cancers 
were significantly decreased when ovarian tissue was 
conserved compared with when both ovaries were 
removed. Several other cohort studies have been pub-
lished. These are small compared with the Nurses’ 
Health Study, and they classify outcomes in different 
ways—for instance, combining heart attack, heart fail-
ure, and stroke. They confirm an association between 
removal of all ovarian tissue and an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease, all cause mortality, or both.4-7
We used a national database of hospital admissions 
and linked it to the national register of deaths to con-
duct a nationwide study of the putative associations 
between removal of all ovarian tissue and important 
health outcomes. Our intention was to conduct an even 
larger study than the Nurses’ Health Study, to do so on 
a countrywide basis rather than in a sample, and to 
examine associations between operation type and sub-
sequent hospital admissions, as well as mortality.
Methods
Framing the question
This study is based on linkage of the English Hospital 
Episode Statistics (HES) and the national registration of 
deaths (Office for National Statistics (ONS)). The Health 
and Social Care Information Centre produces a yearly 
report on the quality of HES data. The accuracy of 
recording of primary diagnosis and primary procedures 
has been consistent between 2010/11 and 2012/13 
(99.3% and 99.9%, respectively).8 Any “database study” 
is constrained by information included in the databases 
and how it is coded.
We took several a priori decisions. Firstly, we 
included women between the age of 35 and 45. The 
upper limit was designed to ensure that the great major-
ity of cases would be premenopausal, so a strong argu-
ment existed to retain ovarian tissue for its putative 
beneficial endocrine effects. The lower limit was 
selected so that included women were typical of the 
majority in whom this decision would be encountered 
in clinical practice, given that hysterectomy is relatively 
uncommon under the age of 35. Secondly, we excluded 
cases with a history of reproductive cancer, including 
cancer of the breast. This conforms to the Nurses’ 
Health Study protocol and is salient to the clinical ques-
tion concerning ovary removal in the absence of spe-
cific risk factors. Thirdly, we compared cases in which 
all ovarian tissue was removed with those with conser-
vation of some ovarian tissue. Again, this is consistent 
with the primary analysis in the Nurses’ Health Study 
(and other studies) and with the clinical question of 
greatest relevance, as the decision to remove some 
ovarian tissue is typically dictated by incidental 
 
pathology (for example, discovery of a dermoid cyst in 
one ovary). Fourthly, outcomes included all cause 
 
mortality, mortality resulting from ischaemic heart dis-
ease and hospital admission for ischaemic heart dis-
ease, cancer (all cancers, ovarian cancer, breast 
cancer), and suicide. We then interrogated the database 
to select the intervention codes that would enable us to 
compare outcome rates by intervention type.
data selection
Selection of patients and generation  
of comparison groups
We collected data from the HES database on all patients 
aged between 35 and 45 who had a hysterectomy 
between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2014 (corresponding 
to the end of the NHS “year”). We hold data from April 
2001 and extracted data from 2004 onwards to allow for 
a minimum of three years of data to be accrued before 
the hysterectomy. The HES database contains informa-
tion on all NHS funded admissions to hospitals in 
England. All admissions are given ICD-10 (international 
classification of disease, 10th revision) diagnosis codes 
and OPCS-4 (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys 
classification of interventions and procedures) proce-
dure codes. The HES database is linked to the Indices of 
Multiple Deprivation database, and we were thus able 
to obtain the socioeconomic status of patients.9
We identified hysterectomies by OPCS codes (Q074, 
Q078, Q079, Q088, and Q089) and then categorised 
them into a bilateral removal group (bilateral ovary 
removal (Q221, Q223) or previous ovary removal fol-
lowed by unilateral ovary removal at time of hysterec-
tomy (Q231, Q232, Q235, Q236)) and an ovarian 
conservation group (no or unilateral ovary removal (as 
above)). We excluded patients who had a diagnosis of 
reproductive cancer (C51-C57) or breast cancer (C50) 
during a previous admission, along with those who had 
an ICD-10 code indicating that they had given a per-
sonal history of a reproductive cancer (Z854). We 
encountered a small proportion of women with codes 
indicating that peri-uterine tissue had been removed as 
part of the hysterectomy (Q071, Q073, Q073, Q081, Q082, 
Q083). Although we suspect that these are coding 
errors, removal of such tissue could signify existence or 
strong suspicion of cancer of the uterus, and we there-
fore excluded these cases. Lastly, we excluded hysterec-
tomies conducted during an emergency admission, as 
this would lie outside the typical scenario in which the 
decision about ovary removal is made.
Covariates
We selected covariates recorded in HES on the basis of 
their known association with outcomes. We categorised 
patients’ ethnicity as “white,” “mixed,” “Asian or Asian 
British,” “black or black British,” “any other ethnic 
group,” or “unknown.” We scored comorbidity by using 
the Charlson comorbidity index. This score is derived 
from the sum of weighted scores of 17 medical 
 
conditions coded as comorbidities in the HES database. 
We treated the score as categorical and split it into 
groups of “0,” “less than 5,” “5 to 10,” “11 to 15,” and 
“more than 15.” A deprivation score for patients based 
on income, employment, health, education, training

and skills, barriers to housing and services, crime, and 
living environment came from the Indices of Multiple 
Deprivation database. We used these scores to produce 
fifths, with fifth 1 being the most deprived and 5 being 
the least deprived. Other variables for risk adjustment/
matching were age and number of previous admissions.
Outcomes
We recorded the following outcomes. (1) Emergency 
readmission rates calculated within both 30 days and 
90 days of the index admission. Reason for admission 
was given by primary ICD-10 diagnosis codes. (2) 
Admissions for a myocardial infarction or other forms of 
ischaemic heart disease (I20-I25) (referred to collec-
tively as ischaemic heart disease). We calculated the 
time between the index admission and first admission 
for ischaemic heart disease. (3) Admissions for subse-
quent cancers (overall and by organ of origin). (4) 
Admissions coded as attempted suicide (X60-X64). (5) 
Information on mortality, time to death, and cause of 
death, gathered using HES linked to the ONS mortality 
files. We classified cause of death as “heart disease,” 
cancer (overall and by organ of origin), and suicide.
Statistical analysis
We tested all variables in a univariate analysis to exam-
ine whether an association existed between the type of 
ovary removal (ovarian conservation group versus bilat-
eral removal group) and the probability of readmission to 
hospital either as an emergency within 90 days or due to 
ischaemic heart disease, cancer, or suicide. We included 
all the significant variables (P<0.05) in a multivariate Cox 
regression, which adjusted for age group, deprivation, 
removal type, and Charlson comorbidity score, as well as 
number of admissions before the hysterectomy. We pro-
duced Kaplan-Meier curves to analyse survival and fitted 
two separate Cox regression models, which included the 
significant variables and estimated the hazard of death 
and an ischaemic heart disease event or other event 
occurring. Proportional hazard assumptions were 
checked and satisfied using log-log plots.
We then created a matched dataset to test for a differ-
ence between women who had a bilateral removal and 
those who had one or no ovaries removed. We did this 
by generating a propensity score using the fitted values 
of a backwards step logistic model with the binary vari-
able being ovarian conservation or bilateral removal. 
The two groups were matched on the above variables 
and also on the hospital in which the operation was 
performed to control for hospital level effects. We used 
the “greedy match” macro in SAS to match on a one to 
one ratio.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-
tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study 
participants or the relevant patient community.
Results
Patients
Between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2014, 126 005 patients 
in the age range of 35-45 had a hysterectomy. Of these, we 
excluded 250 because sex or age was not recorded or 
their recorded residence was outside of England (these 
data are used, along with NHS number, to generate codes 
for follow-up). We also excluded patients if reproductive 
organ related cancer or breast cancer had been diag-
nosed at the time of or before their hysterectomy (4589). 
Other reasons for exclusion were hysterectomies with 
removal of peri-uterine tissue (2460), a personal history 
of reproductive cancer (3128), or emergency hysterec-
tomy (2099). This left a study cohort of 113 679 (some 
women had more than one reason for exclusion), which 
we split into two groups for comparison—women with at 
least one ovary remaining (ovarian conservation: 76 581 
(67
.4%) patients) and those with no ovaries remaining 
(bilateral removal: 37 098 (32.6%) patients). The mean 
length of follow-up was 6.2 (SD 2.84) years.
Of the 113 679 patients in the study, 83 423 had an abdom-
inal operation (Q074, Q078, or Q079), of whom 33 414 
(40.1%) had bilateral ovarian removal. The other 30 256 had 
vaginal surgery (Q089 or Q088), of whom 3684 (12.2%) had 
bilateral ovarian removal. Table 1 gives further details.
The median age of patients was 41 (interquartile range 
39-43) years in the ovarian conservation group and 42 (40-
44) years in the bilateral removal group. A significant dif-
ference existed between the overall demographics of the 
patients in each group. For example, 16.3% (6042/37 098) 
of bilateral removal procedures were performed in the 
West Midlands compared with 10.7% (8184/76 581) of the 
ovarian conservation operations (P<0.001) (table 1). The 
number of hysterectomies in the target age group has 
decreased gradually across the years, from 12 924 in 
2004/05 to 8945 in 2013/14 (see supplementary figure).
admissions to hospital after index hysterectomy
We found no significant difference in χ2 tests between 
groups in the proportion of patients having an emer-
gency readmission within 30 days (P=0.85) or 90 days 
(P=0.47) (table 2 ). Some individual differences in rea-
son for readmission were statistically significant 
(table 2), but the magnitude of difference was small in 
each case (never exceeding 0.4%), and the direction of 
effect was inconsistent—for example, an increase in 
haemorrhage with ovarian conservation and of infec-
tion with bilateral removal.
The rate of admission for ischaemic heart disease 
was 1.60% (1227/76 581) in the ovarian conservation 
group compared with 2.02% (751/37 098) in the bilateral 
removal group. This gives an absolute rate difference of 
0.42% (adjusted hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence 
interval 0.77 to 0.93; P<0.001) (fig 1). The median time to 
event was 56 (interquartile range 25-85) months for the 
ovarian conservation group patients and 51 (23-81.5) 
months for the bilateral removal group (P<0.001).
The rate of admission with any cancer diagnosis was 
also lower in the ovarian conservation group (2.80%) 
than in the bilateral removal group (3.49%) (P<0.001), 
with an absolute rate difference of 0.69% (adjusted

hazard ratio 0.83, 0.78 to 0.89; P<0.001). Table 3 gives 
results for individual cancers. We saw an immediate 
increase in the finding of ovarian cancer when both ova-
ries were removed (0.29% v 0.07%; P<0.001), with an 
absolute rate difference of 0.22%, but the incidence con-
verged over follow-up (fig 2). The median time to ovarian 
cancer diagnosis was 4 (interquartile range 4-14.75) 
months in the bilateral removal group compared with 54 
(28.75-99) months in the ovarian conservation group 
(P<0.001). We return to this point in the discussion.
Overall, 1.01% of patients (1145/113 679) had a diagno-
sis of breast cancer after their hysterectomy. The rate was 
slightly higher in the ovarian conservation group: 1.02% 
(784/76 581) versus 0.97% (361/37 098) in the bilateral 
removal group (adjusted hazard ratio 1.34, 1.15 to 1.55; 
P<0.001). The median time to event was 57
.5 months for 
the ovarian conservation group and 51 months for the 
bilateral removal group (P=0.02). Admission rates were 
significantly lower in the ovarian conservation group for 
cancers of the lung and bladder and highly significantly 
lower (P<0.001) for colon cancer and “any other” cancer 
(table 3).
The rate of admission for attempted suicide was similar 
in the two groups: 2.13% (1632/76 581) in the ovarian con-
servation group and 2.07% (768/37 098) in the bilateral 
removal group, yielding an absolute rate difference of 0.05 
(adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 0.94 to 1.11; P=0.61). The median 
time to event was 39 (interquartile range 19-65) months for 
patients in the ovarian conservation group compared with 
36 (16-63) months in the bilateral removal group (P=0.09).
death rates: HeS linkage to OnS
The rate of all cause death was lower in the group in 
which ovarian tissue was conserved (0.60% v 1.01%; 
P<0.001), with an absolute rate difference of 0.41% 
(adjusted hazard ratio 0.64, 0.55 to 0.73; P<0.001). In the 
ovarian conservation group, 13.4% (61/456) of deaths 
occurred within the first 12 months of hysterectomy com-
pared with 17
.3% (65/376) of the bilateral removal group 
(P=0.12) (fig 3). If ovarian cancer deaths are excluded 
from the above analysis (see discussion for rationale), 
the association is more extreme in favour of ovarian con-
servation (hazard ratio 0.60, 0.52 to 0.69; P<0.01).

46 from heart disease and 472 from cancer, representing 
0.04% and 0.42% of all cases respectively.
The crude rate of death from heart disease was 
0.03% (23/76 581) in the ovarian conservation group 
compared with 0.06% (23/37 098) in the bilateral 
removal group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, 0.28 to 
0.90; P=0.02). The rate of death from cancer was also 
lower in the ovarian conservation group (0.31%; 
237/76 581) than in the  
bilateral removal group (0.63%; 
235/37 098), with a difference of 0.32% (adjusted haz-
ard ratio 0.54, 0.45 to 0.65; P<0.001). As can be seen in 
table 4, deaths were significantly less common in the 
ovarian conservation group than in the bilateral 
removal group in each individual category of cancers, 
except the very rare cases of “reproductive cancers 
other than ovarian and breast” and lung cancer. We 
found no absolute rate difference for completed 
 
suicide between patients in the ovarian conservation 
group and the bilateral removal group (adjusted haz-
ard ratio 1.03, 0.39 to 2.72; P=0.95).
We also tested the main outcomes (all cause death, 
ischaemic heart disease death, cancer death, suicide 
death, ischaemic heart disease admission, cancer 
admission, and suicide admission) by using Cox regres-
sion, after propensity score matching, but the results 
tell the same story as our initial findings (table 5).
discussion
All cause mortality was lower when ovarian tissue was 
conserved than when all ovarian tissue was removed, 
with a statistically significant difference of 0.41 percent-
age points. This amounts to one death in about 240 oper-
ations over 10 years, which is clinically significant. The 
survival curves diverge from the first year, and the result 
is highly significant, even though the mortality rate was 
less than 2% overall within the 10 year time frame of this 
large study. We found a lower rate of ischaemic heart dis-
ease events in the ovarian conservation group. Again, the 
time to event curves diverge from the first postoperative 
year. Cancer deaths were also reduced overall. The over-
all rate of suicide (attempted or completed) was high 
(nearly 2%) but did not differ by oophorectomy status, 
and this is in line with a previous study on this point.6
Our finding in these and other respects are generally 
consistent internally (the admission data corroborate the 
mortality data) and externally (the mortality data in this 
study corroborate findings in the literature). We now dis-
cuss the question of internal and external consistency.
internal consistency
The headline finding of a reduction in admissions for 
ischaemic heart disease is consistent with lower death 
rates from heart disease. Death from heart disease is a 
less common endpoint than overall death, and 
 
confidence limits are thus wider are but still “signifi-
cant” at P=0.01. Likewise, overall cancer data are con-
sistent with lower rates of admission being mirrored by 
lower death rates across cancer as a whole. The results 
are consistent with respect to colon cancer, bladder 
cancer, and “other cancer” (risk of all reduced after

ovarian conservation), whereas cancer of the lung 
showed reduced admissions with ovarian conservation 
but no difference in death rates. The anomaly is breast 
cancer, for which adjusted admission rates were higher 
with ovarian conservation but death rates were lower. 
We return to this point.
external consistency
The main study with which we draw comparison is the 
large Nurses’ Health Study, which is not subject to publi-
cation bias,10  is large, and has long follow-up. Here we 
argue that our results are consistent where this would be 
expected and that, where they diverge, this can be 
explained by the main limitation of our study—limited 
duration of follow-up. Our results are entirely consistent 
with respect to overall mortality and heart disease death 
rates. They are also consistent with respect to cancer as a 
whole, and with respect to certain individual cancers, 
such as colon cancer. The literature as a whole (table 6) 
shows a reduction in colon cancer (incidence and mortal-
ity) with ovarian conservation, which is replicated in this 
study. The situation regarding cancer of the lung is more 
ambiguous in the literature, and this is reflected in the 
null result for mortality observed in this study. Our results 
diverge from both the Nurses’ Health Study and other lit-
erature with respect to ovarian cancer admissions and 
breast cancer. We now discuss these two cancers.
Ovarian cancer
Readmission rates for ovarian cancer were higher when 
both ovaries were removed. The excess of cancers 
appears within a few weeks after ovarian removal, and 
this would not seem to be compatible with a biological 
causation. We believe that this initially paradoxical 
finding has a simple explanation. When the surgeon 
encounters a previously unsuspected thick walled cyst 
that is not obviously cancerous, the possibilities are a 
benign neoplasm (such as a serous cystadenoma), a 
“borderline malignancy,” or a cancer that has not 
 
broken through the ovarian capsule (stage 1A). In such 
a scenario, the surgeon will usually remove the ovary. 
There is a tendency for neoplastic cysts to be bilateral, 
and in some patients the affected ovary will be their 
only remaining ovary. The HES record, which does not 
include outpatient attendances, will be updated when 
the patient is readmitted for further treatment. Further 
evidence for this explanation can be found in conver-
gence of the curves in the two groups during follow-up 
(fig 2 ). Simple extrapolation of these curves yields a 
result compatible with the Nurses’ Health Study and 
with the theoretical expectation that removal of the 
ovaries (along with the proximal end of the fallopian 
tubes) substantially reduces the risk of ovarian cancer 
(which includes some cases that originated from the 
proximal fallopian tubes).17
breast cancer
Our results agree with the Nurses’ Health Study with 
respect to breast cancer—they show an increased inci-
dence of breast cancer with ovarian conservation, and we 
corroborate this by finding an increased rate of post-hys-
terectomy admission with ovarian conservation. Like-
wise, both studies found lower rates of death from breast 
cancer with ovarian conservation—significant in this 
study, non-significant in the Nurses’ Health Study. It is 
possible that, with longer follow-up, our study will show 
that death rates from breast cancer eventually rise in the 
ovarian conservation group, in line with higher admis-
sion rates in this group. However, cancers associated with 
hormone replacement therapy tend to be less advanced 
clinically than those among women who have not used 
such therapy.18 So incidence may not be mirrored in death 
rates when hormones are manipulated in this cancer.
theoretical implications
Our results are broadly in line with theory. In particular, 
theoretical reasons exist to suspect that a drop in endog-
enous oestrogen concentrations may increase the risk of 
cardiovascular disease in iatrogenic menopause, just as 
it seems to do in non-iatrogenic premature meno-
pause.19 
20  The increased risk of breast cancer associated 
with oestrogen may be reflected in higher incidence of 
breast cancer in the ovarian conservation group. The 
risk of colon cancer is reduced by hormone replacement 
therapy in both randomised controlled trials and other 
types of study,21 22  and this is consistent with a lower 
incidence of this cancer in the ovarian conservation 
group in our study and in others. There are sound rea-
sons for thinking that oophorectomy will protect against 
ovarian cancer (even if a proportion of the latter arise in 
the proximal end of the fallopian tube), and this is con-
sistent with the trends depicted in figure 2.

Strengths of this study
Our study was large, including 113 679 partici-
pants—33% in the bilateral group and 67% in the ovar-
ian conservation group. As far as we know, it is the 
largest study to examine this question and included a 
whole country. A caveat with large studies is that a bias 
of a given magnitude is more likely to lead to a false pos-
itive result when studies are large and observations 
 
precise than when observations are less precise. How-
ever, database studies may have greater external valid-
ity than prospective non-randomised cohort studies in 
which people who decline to participate may vary sys-
tematically from those who agree.23  People with previ-
ous heart disease may be systematically less likely to 
have bilateral removal than people with no such his-
tory. However, we found no sign of this in the data (table 
1); if anything, the ovarian conservation group had 
more comorbidities and less deprivation than the com-
parator bilateral oophorectomy group.
limitations of this study
The duration of follow-up was limited to a maximum of 
10 years, but statistical trends emerged despite this, in 
part because the study was large. Limitations in earlier 
versions of the HES data precluded longer follow-up. 
We plan to re-examine the cohort at a later date to 
examine trends over the long term. It is interesting that 
differences in ischaemic heart disease appeared so rap-
idly after the operation. The effect regarding breast can-
cer may reverse during longer follow-up, for reasons 
given above.
The data available in the database are not as detailed 
as might be achieved in a prospective study. In particu-
lar, we do not have information on use of hormone 
replacement therapy. However, our results represent the 
pragmatic association between surgical type and out-
come, irrespective of whether this resulted from failure 
to start hormone replacement therapy, failure to main-
tain its use, or a combination of factors. We also do not 
have data with respect to quality of life in general and 
acute oestrogen deficiency in particular, but such evi-
dence is available from other, more in-depth, studies.6
The study was not randomised, and adjustment may 
have omitted factors that could have affected selection 
of operation type. This is exactly what seems to have 
happened in the particular case of ovarian cancer. That, 
however, is a special case as the decision to remove the 
ovaries arises during the operation itself, as described 
above. We deliberately selected patients in the age 
range of 35 to 45, to isolate the age group in which the 
trade-off between removal and conservation of ovarian 
tissue yields the greatest decision uncertainty. Below 
this age range, the case for removing all ovarian tissue 
is weak in the absence of a specific risk factor. Below the 
age of 35, the relatively low incidence of hysterectomy 
(4.2% of hysterectomies in the HES database), of oopho-
rectomy given hysterectomy (25% in the HES database), 
and of a clinical event during follow-up, make this an 
unpromising age range for study, pending longer-term 
follow-up. Beyond the age of 45, the woman enters the 
peri-menopausal period when arguments for ovarian

conservation are less compelling, and the Nurses’ 
Health Study did not find a protective (or harmful) effect 
from ovarian removal in this group of women. There 
may be some, yet to be discovered, effect of ovarian 
removal/conservation in this older age group, and we 
plan to investigate this possibility when more women/
years of “exposure” have been accrued.
Clinical relevance
Our data corroborate theory and the Nurses’ Health Study 
data in finding an association between bilateral oopho-
rectomy and ischaemic heart disease. Cancer deaths and 
overall mortality were also increased, again in line with 
the Nurses’ Health Study. Although selection bias remains 
a possibility, the corroboration between two different 
methods may offer a measure of confirmation beyond that 
of just one more replication of a similar study.24  The over-
all incidence of hysterectomy is declining, in contradic-
tion of an earlier prediction from one of the authors.25 
However, the data show only a slow decline in use of this 
operation; nearly 9000 women had hysterectomy for a 
benign condition in the target age range in 2014. These 
women are likely to be interested in, and may be influ-
enced by, our study. Forty per cent of women with no spe-
cific risk factors for reproductive cancer had their ovaries 
removed during abdominal hysterectomy in the 35-45 age 
group. This might be a higher proportion than would be 
expected among women who were fully cognisant of the 
worse health outcomes with bilateral removal reported 
here. In that case, we might expect the proportion of 
women who select bilateral ovarian removal to decline as 
the health risks that must be traded for a reduced inci-
dence of ovarian cancer come into sharper focus.
