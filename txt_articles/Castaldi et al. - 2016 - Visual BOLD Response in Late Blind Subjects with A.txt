Abstract
Retinal prosthesis technologies require that the visual system downstream of the retinal cir-
cuitry be capable of transmitting and elaborating visual signals. We studied the capability of
plastic remodeling in late blind subjects implanted with the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis with
psychophysics and functional MRI (fMRI). After surgery, six out of seven retinitis pigmen-
tosa (RP) blind subjects were able to detect high-contrast stimuli using the prosthetic
implant. However, direction discrimination to contrast modulated stimuli remained at
chance level in all of them. No subject showed any improvement of contrast sensitivity in
either eye when not using the Argus II. Before the implant, the Blood Oxygenation Level
Dependent (BOLD) activity in V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) was very weak
or absent. Surprisingly, after prolonged use of Argus II, BOLD responses to visual input
were enhanced. This is, to our knowledge, the first study tracking the neural changes of
visual areas in patients after retinal implant, revealing a capacity to respond to restored
visual input even after years of deprivation.
Author Summary
The majority of pathologies leading to blindness are related to diseases of the photorecep-
tors, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). A wide variety of different methods are being
developed in the attempt to partially restore vision in blind people, including a retinal
prosthesis that uses electricalstimulation of the retina to elicit neural responses in the
visual pathway. However, restoring appropriate function to the retina does not necessarily
imply that the patients can see again, given that plasticity of the primary visual cortex
retained by the adult brain is limited, especially after many years of blindness. Here, we fol-
lowed the sight recovery process in adult patients with the retinal implant Argus II using
changes in blood oxygen levels as a readout of neural activity. The recovery of vision
depended on the amount of time and practice the subject experiencedwith the implant,
implying that the reorganization process takes time to develop. Importantly, we observed
that subjects who used the prosthetic implant the most were also the ones whose response
along thalamic visual pathways and the primary cortex increased before and after sight

 restoration. Overall, these results suggest that there is residual plasticity in adult subjects
and that the adult brain can learn to “see” using an artificial visual input.
Introduction
A wide range of approaches towards sight restoration are currently being developed, opening
new possibilities for blind people with retinal pathologies. These possibilities range from opto-
genetics techniques [1] through gene therapy [2] to cortical and retinal prosthesis [3,4]. The
first retinal prosthesis to enter clinical trials was a 5000-electrode microphotodiode chip (Arti-
ficial Silicon Retina [ASR], subretinal approach; Optobionics, Glen Ellyn, Ill, 2000, see [5–7]),
and it produced successful results. At present, two devices have been approved as commercial
products with clinical trials: the subretinal visual implants Alpha IMS (Retina Implant AG,
Reutlingen, Germany, see [8,9]), which induce excitation of the internal plexiform layer, and
the Argus II implants (Second Sight, Sylmar, CA, see [10–12]), which induce excitation of the
ganglion cell axons with an epiretinal implant, requiring simpler and less invasive surgery.
Most of the retinal pathologies develop late in life, and little is known about the capacity of
the adult visual system to process restored visual input after many years of deprivation. Fine
et al. [13] describedthe patient MM, who had his vision restored 40 years after becoming blind
at the age of three, when the critical period of vision in human is still open [14]. The study
shows that only very limited plasticity was preserved, especially in V1, and that was strictly
dependent on the short visual experience during childhood.Cross-modal plasticity [15–18],
known to occur also in late blind subjects [19], may raise an additional obstacle to reactivate
cortical responses to the restored input [20,21]. The success of a cochlear implant in restoring
auditory function correlates well with the level of inactivity of acoustic primary cortices, as
assessed by positron emission tomography study [22]. Similarly, the degree of vision loss in ret-
initis pigmentosa (RP) patients correlates with primary visual cortical responses to tactile sti-
muli [23,24]. Interestingly, in one case of restored vision (Boston Keratoprostesis, see [25]),
responses to motion stimuli were enhanced in extra-striate occipital areas seven months after
visual restoration, and this was accompanied by a decreased recruitment of acoustic processing
[26]. All these data suggest that, after the original input is restored, the brain needs time to pro-
mote a response to the original sensation. This idea is consistent with the results describedby
Cunningham et al. [23] on two subjects with Argus II Retinal Prosthesis: the first subject (who
had the implant only for six weeks before the scanning) showed extensive tactile-evoked
responses in V1, whereas in the second subject (who had the implant for 15 weeks), it was
largely decreased.
After extensive training, patients with Argus II implants learn to perform a few easy behav-
ioral tasks, such as moving independently in space, locating a large bright square on a screen,
and reading large, 100%-contrast characters [10,27–31]. Interestingly, after this learning, the
Goldmann visual field perimetryof the operated eye improved in all subjects tested, also well
outside the retinotopic region covered by the implant [27]. In one patient, there was also a sub-
stantial improvement of the unoperated eye [32]. These findings are in line with the earlier evi-
dence obtained with the subretinal implant ASR [5–7]. These patients were tested for many
years after the operation and showed a great improvement of visual acuity and also of the visual
field perimetry, assessed by computerized methods, compared with the unoperated eye. Inter-
estingly, the visual field also improved in regions that were not directly stimulated by the
implant. Two effects may mediate the improved visibility revealed by these studies: the learning
of the artificial visual signals may reopen central visual plasticity, and this need not be

 retinotopically specific,or release of a peripheral trophic factor may be induced by the injection
of current by the implant when in use, and this may diffuse at the not-activated site of the ret-
ina [33]. Indeed, Sabel et al. [34] demonstrated an improvement in static perimetryand in
visual acuity associated with alpha-band changes in the electroencephalogram(EEG) after only
40 min of noninvasive alternating current stimulation (ACS) delivered transorbitally.
At present, the origin of the increased visibility after Argus II, ASR, or Alpha IMS implants
is not clear. In particular, it is not clear whether it is mediated by local retinal mechanisms or
by releasing vetoed mechanisms at a central level, such as the thalamus or cortex. In this experi-
ment, we aim to study whether these changes can be traced by measuring Blood Oxygenation
Level Dependent (BOLD) visual cortical responses during the course of training with Argus II
Retinal Prosthesis. The results show that the thalamus and the cortical responses are enhanced
by the use of the implant, pointing to great neuronal plasticity of the adult blind brain.
Results
The surgery was successfully performed in all RP subjects (Fig 1) within similar operating time
(see Table 1). No subject had adverse reactions or complications, except for S7, who reported a
choroidal detachment two months after the last assessment, which was resolved in two surgery
revisions. Six months after surgery, S3 developed a localized retinoschisis behind the implant,
which was kept under observationbut not treated, because it did not affect the implant effective
stimulation. The position of the implant was similar in all patients and presumably excited a
similar amount of fibers (see Fig 1).
Given the recruitment criteria of bare light perception (see Methods), before surgery, sub-
jects’ performance for monocular vision was nearly at chance for the motion direction discrim-
ination of contrast modulated gratings (Fig 2C and 2D, gray and black columns). After
surgery, no improvement was measured in the motion direction discrimination task either for
the implanted eye with the Argus II system switched on or off (Fig 2C, red and green columns)
or for the nonimplanted eye (Fig 2D, blue column). The performance for this task was very
similar for patients, eyes, and time from the surgery, as shown by the sensitivity measures
reported in S1A Fig. Also, contrast sensitivity measured in a detection task in two-interval,
two-alternative force choice was nearly at chance level (Fig 2C, green dot) and constant over
time (S1B Fig). Consistently, with the lack of cataract, the two phakic patients (S3 and S7) had
no change in contrast sensitivity before and after surgery that involved also lens removal (see
Methods). All subjects except S7 learned quickly to use the Argus II device, and some simple
performance, like the spatial localization of a square of maximum luminance, improved over
the testing period (see S2 Fig) when using the implant. Surprisingly, when testing the
implanted eye with the Argus II system switched on (Fig 2C, red dot), subjects' performance
reached 90% accuracy (t(6) = 6.3; p < 0.001) even in more subtle tasks, like the detection of
contrast-modulated grating not associated with luminance variation. This improvement in
detection performance with the Argus II system switched on correlates significantly
(rho = 0.95, p < 0.05) with the time from the surgery, suggesting that the effect results from
perceptual learning of the artificial incoming signals (Fig 2E).
We recruited four RP patients to measure the BOLD response before and after surgery in
response to a sequence of flashes of lights (1 Hz). However, one of these patients did not com-
ply with the procedure of the Argus II training and failed to follow the training routine. For
this reason, his data are treated separately and are not included in the functional MRI (fMRI)
group analysis. In normal sighted subjects, the flashes of lights massively activate all of the
occipital, temporal, and parietal visual brain (p < 0.005, corresponding to False Discovery Rate
[FDR] q-value of <0.05; Fig 3A). To our surprise, and despite the absence of visual evoked

 occipital sulcus, and the mediotemporal sulcus. In all four patients, we performed the fMRI
scan again after surgery using the same stimuli with the Argus II system switched off. The acti-
vation increased in V1 in the group of three patients who complied with the training. Also, in
the LGN, the responses became statistically significant (Fig 3C for the right hemisphere [RH]
ipsilateral to the implant, p < 0.01, uncorrected).
To quantify the increase in activation, we measured the average beta values in the anatomi-
cally defined regions of interest (ROIs) positioned along the calcarine sulcus and LGN in all
four patients. This technique allows detection of changes that may occur at different cortical
positions across subjects, as it is to be expected,given the great variability of the perimetry

 between subjects. The beta values at the level of the LGN (Fig 4A and 4B), both contralateral
and ipsilateral to the implant, increased in amplitude after the surgery in the three subjects
tested (S4, S5, and S6), reaching statistical significance(p < 0.005). A similar increase was mea-
sured in the V1 region (Fig 4C and 4D), selected anatomically to encompass the first 20 degrees
of visual space representation. Interestingly, a significant response improvement in the LGN
and V1 was not observedin subject S7, despite the removal of the lens during the surgery that
should have clarity of the ocular media. This subject did not follow the training procedure or
use the Argus II daily; he showed no improvement in detection with the Argus II system
switched on (triangle in Fig 2E). The result of this subject is clearly at odds with those of the
other subjects. The repeated measure ANOVA performed on the data of the three subjects who
used the implant shows a significant increase in BOLD activity after surgery (main effect of
time, F(1,2) = 26.8, p < 0.05; estimated marginal means: before the surgery = 0.18 ± 0.072,
after the surgery = 0.516 ± 0.070). We did not observe any significant main effect of the ROIs
(F(3,6) = 1.55, p = 0.29), indicating that the BOLD increase did not differ between ROIs, nor
was it a significant effect of interaction between ROIs and time (F(3,6) = 0.64, p = 0.60).
The availability of an RP subject who had a successful surgery but did not use the device
provides the rare possibility to disentangle the physical effects of implant and wireless opera-
tion from the use of the device as a visual aid in eliciting plasticity. To assess whether the
increase in BOLD activity in the LGN and V1 might have a functional relevance, we correlated
the BOLD increase with the performance scored in the detection task when testing the
implanted eye with the Argus II system switched on (Fig 4E and 4F). The data show that the
subjects who performed the detection task with greater sensitivity (with Argus II on) also have
higher BOLD responses in the LGN and V1. To assess the significance of this effect, we

 performed a two-way repeated measure ANOVA on BOLD changes, with the factors visual
sensitivity and ROIs (hemisphere being a within factor), and obtained a significant effect for
the visual sensitivity factor (F(3.1) = 45, p = 0.005). The effect of ROIs and the interaction
between ROIs and sensitivity were not significant.
We also performed a direct BOLD contrast between the activation before (blue) and after
(red) surgery in the three individual subjects (Fig 5), mapping the results on the average brain
where average retinotopy acquired by our laboratory has been projected (see Methods). After
surgery, the activity improved in the primary visual cortex and in the mediotemporal and occi-
pitotemporal sulcus. The improvement is statistically significant (p < 0.05) but did not survive
FDR correction. However, the anatomical localization of the increased activity voxels is not

 random, but clustered within the primary and secondary visual cortex, including V1, V2, and
V3 in the peripheral visual field representation. This corroborates the ROI ANOVA result, sug-
gesting an increase in BOLD activity in these areas after surgery. In addition, given that the
retinotopic position of the improvement will vary across subjects, a group analysis is not the
optimal technique to detect the possible BOLD changes, and the ROI analysis is more appro-
priate. Similarly, many higher associative visual areas (like lateral occipital [LO], V3AB, V7,
and MT+) showed higher signal before the surgery, suggesting a suppression of these area by
the new visual activation (see Discussion).
To rule out the possibility that these results were due to magnetic field interference between
the magnetic gradients and the implant (which has local coils and wireless hardware), we per-
formed additional scans, decreasing the number of slices for the subject S4 (S3 Fig) and chang-
ing the slice orientation or the visual display for the subject S6 (S4 Fig). No difference was
observedin the left and right LGN (t(116) = 0.068, p = 0.9; t(116) = 0.20, p = 0.8), nor in the
left and right calcarine sulcus (t(116) = 0.51, p = 0.6; t(116) = 0.49, p = 0.6). Similarly, no differ-
ences in beta values were observedin S6 (S4 Fig), nor in left and right LGN (t(116) = -0.1,
p = 0.8; t(116) = -0.6, p = 0.5), nor in the left and right calcarine sulcus (t(116) = 1.04, p = 0.3; t
(116) = 0.6, p = 0.5).
Discussion
Here, we have demonstrated that the adult visual brain retains a degree of plasticity and is able
to reorganize its response to process new and abnormal incoming inputs after many years of
deprivation in adulthood. The boost in BOLD response takes a long time and intensive training
to appear, being stronger in those subjects who used the prosthetic device more intensely and
for a longer time. Our data show that the training with Argus II transfers to more subtle
improvements than previously observed[30], including the detection of sinusoidal gratings
that the patients never saw before and, importantly, that are not associated with overall mean
luminance changes. We observedno improvement for the nonimplanted eye and no improve-
ment for motion direction discrimination, even with the Argus II system on. It has been sug-
gested [35] that the perceptual experience produced by the implant might be distorted due to
the axonal stimulation of the ganglion cell axons that travel under the implant, introducing
motion smear. This may help to explain the lack of improvement for horizontal motion dis-
crimination observedhere.
Recent studies have revealed that the adult V1 cortex retains plasticity with deprivation
[36,37], even after a brief period of hours of monocular alteration [38]. The BOLD boost that
we observedhere reinforces this evidence and shows that the plasticity is retained even after
years of deprivation. Other sensory modalities usually recruit the occipital cortex after periods
of deprivation [15]. This can take place even in normal sighted subjects with training [39] and
also in RP patients with loss of vision at adult age [19]. Interestingly, in the RP patients, as in
the congenitally blind, the recruitment of the primary cortex is particularly strong with lan-
guage and memory areas, as demonstrated by the increase in functional connectivity between
the occipital cortex, frontal cortex [40,41], and Broca area [41], rather than with other sensory
cortex. The need for extensive and prolonged training, suggested by our data, is probably nec-
essary to allow the remodeling of these spurious multisensory activations. A previous study
with cochlear implant [22] on prelingually deaf children demonstrated that the degree of cross-
modal plasticity (marked by glucose hypometabolism) predicts the auditory temporal cortex’s
capability to respond to auditory stimuli of the cochlear implant and the overall success of the
functional use of the implant. Prolonged periods of deafness induced stronger cross-modal
reorganization of the acoustic cortex and hampered recovery after the cochlear implant. These

 results are in close agreement with the present results, establishing that the functional response
of the appropriate modality response is a good indicator of the use of the implant and of the
plastic cortical response. All our patients had only light-dark perception, which may explain
the small residual BOLD activation observedin the presurgical scan. Interestingly, none of the
four patients reported perceiving the flashing stimulus, probably because of the low intensity of
the flashes. However, some activity was clearly elicited, suggesting that some functional con-
nection between retinal input and the cortex is still present in these RP patients despite the lack
of subjective report and the lack of VEP responses. This also indicates that the cross-modal
plasticity in V1 demonstrated by many studies [15] did not veto the cortex from responding to
the flashes. Overall, our data suggest that if a patient had enough visual experience before
blindness and has some residual light perception, once new vision information—even artificial
and aberrant—is relayed to the brain, the primary visual cortex can reactivate to endorse a plas-
tic cortical response. The more prolonged the exposure to the artificial vision, the stronger the
response of V1 to the artificial visual input. Interestingly, two other patients implanted with
Argus II [23] have been reported to show a reduction of tactile cross-sensory plasticity in V1
after use of the implant, suggesting that the first step of the plastic response of the primary
visual cortex is the weakening of the cross-modal responses and, later on, the restoration of the
original visual modality. These two patients did not show any response to visual stimuli, but
they were tested only a few months after surgery, reinforcing the present data that a longer
time is need to promote plasticity. We observedan increase of BOLD activity in the V1, V2,
and V3 corticies, but not in MT+, LO, nor in associative cortices such as intraparietal, superior
temporal, and precuneous cortices. This suggests that higher associative areas that have stron-
ger cross-modal plasticity [18,42–46] may have hampered the visual responses. The lack of a
global activation of all the visual cortical circuits may also explain the lack of perception in
these patients. It would be interesting to follow these patients for a longer time, implementing a
more intense training regimen to verify the hypothesis that eventually these associative cortices
may also respond to light, and then, perhaps, perception could also be partially rescued.
The spared plasticity of V1 and low tier associative cortices was not expected, given the pre-
vailing evidence of low plasticity to visual stimuli observedin the two subjects who regained
vision at adult age [13,26]. However, both of these studies followed the progression of congeni-
tally blind patients or patients who became blind during the critical period.The data on the sub-
ject MM [13] are very clear in stating that even after more than ten years of restored vision, the
visual response did not change [47]. Interestingly, the only plastic reorganization was observedin
area MT+, specializedfor motion processing [16,18]. Development of motion-selectivemecha-
nisms is nearly complete at three years, the time of the blindness onset of this patient [14,48].
Even more surprisingly, we observedplastic changes even in the thalamus. LGN plasticity, even
during development, is usually believed to be very limited [49]. It is surprising that the effect that
we observedhere for the LGN is nearly as strong as for V1. One possibility it is that it is mediated
by an attentional modulation towards a stimulus known to modulate activity in LGN [50]. How-
ever, this is unlikely, because no subject reported seeing any stimulus during the scan despite the
BOLD activity. The lack of perception was also confirmedby the total absence of any electroreti-
nogram (ERG) or VEP responses. Another possibility it is that the plastic changes originate at
the retinal level, mediated by some local and unknown trophic effect.
The first study to use a subretinal implant observeda clear recovery of visual acuity and
perimetryin six out of ten patients over a period of seven years from the surgery [5–7]. The
recovery was not confined to the stimulated retinal position, being observedvery far from it,
but it was confined to the same eye. This suggests that it might be mediated by a retinal trophic
effect induced by the surgery itself, by the local injection of current, or even by the overall
improvement in eye health after surgery. Ciavatta et al. [33] observeda significant elevation in

 fibroblast growth factor-2 (Fgf2) expression in rats following implantation of an active micro-
photodiode array compared with rats with a minimally active array or sham surgery. These
authors suggested that subretinal electricalstimulation by the active array induced selective
Fgf2 expression, producing a neuroprotective effect on the retina. Also, an expansion of the
visual field perimetry[27] has been observedin some Argus II patients, consistent with the dif-
fusion of retinal trophic factors. However, in one patient, there was also a strong improvement
of the temporal retina of the fellow eye as well of the operated eye. The improvement in both
eyes declined as the patient used the device less. This latter result is hard to explain in terms of
release of a retinal trophic factor and also in terms of electricalstimulation, given that the elec-
trical field produced by the wireless coils attached to the Argus II is very low at the distance of
the fellow eye. Interestingly, the improvement occurredfor homologue regions of the retina,
which might suggest that it is the neuronal activity at higher levels in the visual pathways that
might exert a trophic function. For example, the influence of the operated eye on the fellow eye
may be mediated by an anterograde effect from a central station such as the LGN, where the
projection of the fiber from the two eyes is closely interlayered, and some cross-talk of neuronal
discharge may take place. The fact that patient S7 of the present study did not show any improve-
ment in BOLD response does not support the view that plasticity arises from the surgery itself or
by the overall improvement in eye health after surgery. This patient had the same successful sur-
gery, the same visibility thresholds, and similar years of deprivation to the other patients. How-
ever, he was the only one who did not use the Argus II system. The lack of visual responses in this
patient provides a strong control against possible artifacts between the device and the magnetic
field, which might have influencedthe increase of the BOLD response after surgery. Although at
this stage it is very difficultto disentangle the origin of the observedrecovery after surgery, our
data indicate that the neuroplastic response is present at the early stage of processing.
Whatever the mechanisms mediating the plasticity, it is worthwhile to stress a few impor-
tant implications of our results. They show that the adult brain is able to reorganize itself to
adapt to the new incoming visual stimulation even after years of blindness; this takes place only
after extensive training and well before proper perception is achieved; the BOLD signal is more
sensitive than a perceptual threshold or EEG measure to monitor these changes. The reason for
the superiority of BOLD in monitoring these changes might be that signals from multiple
sources, both bottom-up and top-down, are integrated within the BOLD response and over
long periods.In addition, this also indicates that some activity related to the visual stimulus
reaches the cortex in RP patients despite complete blindness. If so, this suggests that, in RP
patients, the input signal may be actively suppressed at the cortical level, probably because it is
too aberrant and temporally noisy to mediate a perceptual response.
Methods
Subjects
All subjects signed the informed consent for prosthesis implant after being informed about the
possible outcomes of the surgery. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Azienda Ospedaliera Pisana (IRB IRB00010229). The trial was and continues to be conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the national regulations for medical device
clinical trials in Italy. The clinical trial is posted in a publicly accessible registry approved by
the WHO or ICMJE on www.clinicaltrials.gov (trial registration number NCT01490827) and
adheres to the TREND guidelines for nonrandomized trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT01490827?term=Argus&rank=5).
The MRI and the psychophysical protocol of this study were approved by the Ethics Com-
mittee of Fondazione Stella Maris (protocol N 11/2012, IRB00003240), which has been

 superseded by the Regional Pediatric Ethical Board (IRB 00009689). All subjects signed
informed consent to participate.
This study was conducted on a group of seven blind patients (males = 4, females = 3,
age = 60 ± 6 years) affected with RP with bare Light Perception, before and after (17 ± 7 month
interval) implantation with Argus II Retinal Prosthesis. All subjects were required to have
some visual memory, no electro-retinographicresponse, and residual light perception,
although bare. Exclusion criteria included the presence of other ocular disease that might inter-
fere with device function or inhibit postoperative device visualization; history of cystic macular
edema; pregnancy or desire to become pregnant; deafness; and uncontrolled systemic disease.
The initial screening visit included a complete eye examination, retinal fundus photography,
fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), Goldman full-field visual field
testing, and ultrasound (A-scan) axial length measurement. Only patients with axial lengths
between 20.5 and 26.0 mm were included. All patients had immeasurable monocular logMAR
(logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) visual acuity (worse than 2.9) before surgery.
All preoperative tests were performed with both eyes open and, in pseudophakic patients, sev-
eral years after cataract surgeries. In order to avoid a further intervention of phacoemulsifica-
tion a few months later, phakic patients underwent clear cornea phacoemulsification and were
left aphakic, given that pars plana vitrectomy is a risk factor for cataract progression [51]. The
two phakic patients had a normal lens with only an initial sclerosis that did not impair light
transmission. No other eye diseases were present. Subject details are listed in Table 1.
The surgery and the rehabilitation were conducted as previously described[27]. Only one
eye was implanted (Fig 1). During the use of the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis system, patients
need to wear glasses equipped with a central mounted camera. This camera is connected to a
video processing unit carried on the patient's body. The video processing unit converts images
captured from the camera into electronic signals and sends it to a transmitter coil attached to
the glasses. The transmitter coil sends the information wirelessly to a receiver coil that is
sutured onto the sclera with a scleral band. A transcleral cable conveys the signals from the
receiver coil to a 6 x 10 grid of electrodes array held on the retinal surface (covering about 11 x
17 visual angle degrees) that is abruptly refreshed at a low frequency (below 20 Hz). When acti-
vated, each gold electrode emits pulses, which are thought to directly stimulate the retinal gan-
glion cells or their axons (but see [35]). The patients usually learn to use the device after
intensive training consisting in perceiving and localizing crude high-contrast forms and lights
on a screen, and following a post-implant visual rehabilitation with the support of low vision
therapists.
ERG, VEP, and Psychophysical Procedure
ERGs were recorded differentially with gold-coated Mylar electrodes positioned in the lower
fornix of each eye. The other eye was closed and served as a reference (interocular PERG: [52]).
We also recorded VEPs, with Ag-AgCl electrodes placed 2 cm above the inion (active) and at
the vertex. The common ground for all recordings was on the forehead. PERG and VEP signals
were amplified (PERG 100,000-fold, VEP 50,000-fold), band-pass filtered between 1–100 Hz (6
dB/oct) and averaged on-line by computer over at least 300 periods. The visual stimulus was a
strong flash (500 mJ) positioned at about 20 cm distance from the subject eye and delivered at
a frequency of 0.5 Hz. We never measured any ERG or VEP reliable responses in any of the RP
subjects, consistent with the diagnosis of total blind or bare light perception, both before and
after surgery.
The vision of the implanted and the not implanted eye was tested in psychophysical experi-
ments in separate sessions both before and after surgery. When testing with the Argus II system

 switched on, the subjects' eyes were patched so that only the activity delivered by the implant
could be used.
Subjects sat in front of a large screen (86 x 55 degree, luminance 180 cd/m2) at a comfortable
distance of 57 cm. The stimuli were contrast-modulated gratings, perfectly linearized by
gamma correcting the monitor after collecting the photometric values at all luminance levels
(from 5 to 350 cd/m2) to avoid abrupt increment of luminance that could aid detection in the
blind patients given the residual light perception.
Visual functions were evaluated before and after the implant with a motion direction dis-
crimination task and a detection task, with a single or double presentation two-alternative
forced choice procedure. The stimuli were optimized to achieve the best performance for the
blind patients or for the Argus II device. In the "Motion Direction Discrimination Task" (Fig
2A), subjects were asked to indicate the direction of a drifting grating. A high-contrast (60%
Michelson contrast) grating, 40 degrees wide with spatial frequency of 0.0625 cpd, was abruptly
presented for 1 or 0.5 s when testing the Argus II system switched on or off, respectively. The
grating drifted rightward or leftward at 1 Hz for the Argus II system on or 4 Hz for the Argus II
system off. The long presentation time and slow temporal frequency were chosen to be certain
to be inside the sampling frequency and the transient delivery of the device. In the "Detection
Task" (Fig 2B) the subjects were asked to specify in which of two intervals (marked by tones)
was the stationary, low spatial frequency grating presented (for 1 s). The intervals were marked
acoustically by tones and separated by more than 5 s. No feedback was given to the subjects.
Each subject performed three sessions of ten trials each per each eye and condition for the
motion direction discrimination task and two sessions of ten trials each for the detection task.
We allowed all the necessary time for the subject to reach a decision. Usually they took a very
long time, in the order of seconds. This meant that the separation between trials was variable,
but always longer than 1 s.
For each subject, the average accuracy was calculated and transformed to detectability, d-
prime. A one-sample t test against 0.5 was performed in each subject to assess the visual perfor-
mance in the detection task after the surgery.
We also performed the Square Localization test, used previously with Argus II patients [10,27].
On a touch screen display, a white square 7.3 cm wide was displayed on a black background
(100% contrast) at random positions. The patient, at 30.5 cm from the screen with free head
movements, was asked to localize the center of the square on the screen with a reach-and-touch
movement. The task was repeated 40 times, and the average difference between the square center
and the patient’s touch, in centimeters, was automatically computed by the testing software.
MRI
Four subjects (S4, S5, S6, S7) also underwent MRI examination in a 1.5 T GE scanner before
and after surgery.
The MRI compatibility and issues of the Argus II system retinal prosthesis have been previ-
ously tested [23,53], and the system has been labeled as an MR conditional device (http://www.
mrisafety.com/SafetyInfov.asp?SafetyInfoID=313).
Following the MRI recommended procedures, the scanning sessions lasted only 15 min after
the surgery. The Argus II system was switched off at least 2 h before the scanning to allow dis-
charge of the wireless coil current and remained off during the exam. Subjects were instructedto
notify the MRI operator if pain or unusual sensation of heat was occurringduring the scanning,
giving particularattention to the orbital region. No subjects reported any uncomfortable feelings
of this kind during the examination. The subjects’ eyes were monitored through an infrared cam-
era to assess discomfort symptoms like excessive blinking or squeezing.

 MRI data were acquired using a GE 1.5 THD Neuro-optimized System (General Electric
Medical Systems) fitted with 40 mT/m high-speedgradients. Each session included a whole brain
set of anatomical images with T1-weighted contrast. T1-weighted scans were acquired using a
FSPGR sequence with TR = 8.4 ms, TE = 3.9 ms, flip angle = 8°, and 1 mm3 isotropic resolution.
Echo Planar Imaging Gradient Echo (EPI-GRE) sequences were used for the fMRI data acquisi-
tion (TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 35 ms FOV = 192 x 192 mm, flip angle = 90°, matrix size of 64 x 64,
and slice thickness = 3 mm). Head movement was minimized by padding and tape.
During fMRI scanning, 15 s of full-field (20° x 30°) flashing stimuli (maximum range 0.1
cd/m2 to 60 cd/m2 at 1 Hz: 500 ms on and 500 ms off)alternated with 15 s rest periods of dark
six times. Stimuli were displayed through liquid crystal goggles equipped with infrared eye-
movement camera (VisuaStim XGA Resonance Technology at a resolution of 800 × 600 voxels,
subtending 30° × 22.5° at an apparent distance of 1.5 m, with mean luminance of 30 cd/m2).
Subjects were instructed to keep their eyes open, which were monitored and recorded in all
subjects. After the MRI scan, we questioned the subjects about their perception during the
scan. All of them reported not perceiving the flashes.
Subjects performed one anatomical scan and two functional scans before and after the
surgery.
As reported on the MRI-safety website, the implant may create artifacts and MR signal
drop. In line with Cunningham et al. [23], we observedlocal artifacts of the implant during the
EPI sequences that were strictly limited to the patient's implanted eye and did not extend to the
cortical or subcorticalregions. To quantify the local artifact, we calculated the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) by dividing the mean pixel intensity value in an ROI by the standard deviation of
an external ROI of the same extent (in the air region outside the ghosting artifacts). We mea-
sured the SNR before (SNRpre) and after (SNRpost) surgery in the three ROIs: one centered
on the eye, the second centered on the LGN ipsilateral to the implant, and the last on the ipsi-
lateral primary visual cortex. The SNR of the ROI centered on the implanted eye was signifi-
cantly different (SNRpre = 17 ± 11; SNRpost = 1.5 ± 0.3) before and after surgery, whereas the
one centered on the LGN (SNRpre = 31 ± 11; SNRpost = 32 ± 11) and the one centered in V1
(SNRpre = 100 ± 8; SNRpost = 100 ± 8) were not, confirmingthat the artifact did not affect the sig-
nal at these levels. To rule out further potential confounds due to interaction betweenthe implant
and the magnetic field gradients, we ran control scans in two subjects, varying the scanning condi-
tion and parameters. In one subject (S4), fMRI was performedby scanning with a different num-
ber of slices covering the brain (13 or 30 slices) while keeping the TR constant. If the BOLD signal
were driven by the interaction between implant and the changing gradients, we would have
expecteda different activation betweenthese two conditions. In another subject (S6), fMRI was
performedby scanning with axial or oblique slice orientation, hence including or not including the
implant in the field of view (FoV). Additionally, to also eliminate possible artifact induced by the
goggles,we also delivered the flash via an optic fiber bundle, previously used by [54].
Data Analysis
Imaging data were analyzed with Brain Voyager Qx (version 2.8 Copyright 2001–2015 Rainer
Goebel). Anatomical images were spatially normalized using the Talairach and Tournox atlas
[55] to obtain standardized coordinates for the ROI.
Functional data were preprocessed to compensate for systematic slice-dependent differences
in acquisition time (using cubic spline), three-dimensional motion correction (using Trilinear/
Sync interpolation realigning data to the first volume of the first scan), and temporal filtered
(high-pass filter GLM with Fourier basis set, including linear trend, with two cycles). No spatial
smoothing was used.

 We analyzed the data with a multi-study, multi-subjects fixed effect GLM with one regressor
corresponding to the flashing light blocks. The regressor was convolved with the canonical
hemodynamic response function (HRF). The BOLD modulation recorded during scans before
and after the surgery was contrasted.
Beta values were extracted from two anatomically defined regions of interest. The LGN was
localized individually for each single subject with the help of an expert neuro-radiologist,and a
216-mm3 ROI was defined around it. The LGN was identified according to anatomical land-
marks, as previously describedin literature [56–59], and direct measurements in control sub-
jects in response to flashing lights. Anatomically, the LGN was localized on top of the apex of
the lateral recess of the ambient cistern in between the optic radiation laterally and the poste-
rior limb of the internal capsule anteromedially. On coronal view, the LGN was visible above
the hippocampus. In control subjects, the anatomical localization of the LGN matched exactly
with the area activated when subjects were exposed to flashing lights.
The ROI on the calcarine sulcus was defined from the most occipital pole along the sulcus
for about 3 cm, representing about 20 degrees of visual space [60,61].
To assess the significanceof the ROI analysis, we performed a two-way repeated measure
ANOVA, with two factors: "ROIs" of 4 levels (LGN left hemisphere [LH], LGN RH, V1 LH, V1
RH) and "surgery" with 2 levels (before and after).
To identify the visual areas showing activation changes, we performed cortex-based align-
ment between the RP patients and a control-sighting subject who underwent standard retino-
topic mapping. From all the subjects of our database with retinotopic identification of visual
area, we chose the one that more closely aligns with the average location of the border of the
visual cortical areas across subjects [54,62]. This procedure aligns the brains of a group using
the gyral/sulcalfolding pattern of the cortex and not the less precise alignment based on the
anterior, posterior commissures and the six points defining the limit of the Talairach space. In
order to identify the anatomical regions that were falling outside standard retinotopic bound-
aries, we performed the cortex-based alignment of the RP patients with the Brain Voyager
atlas, providing parcellation maps.
