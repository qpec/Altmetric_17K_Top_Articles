Abstract  
Background: Sports drinks intended to improve performance and hydrate athletes taking part in 
endurance sport are being marketed to children, for whom these products are not intended.  
Popularity amongst children has grown exponentially, worryingly they consume them socially, 
as well as during physical activity.  Sports drinks are high in sugar and are acidic. Product 
marketing ignores the potential harmful effects of dental caries and erosion.  
Objective: To investigate the use of sports drinks by children. 
Method: 183 self-complete questionnaires were distributed to four schools in South Wales. 
Children in high school years 8 and 9 (aged 12 - 14) were recruited to take part. Questions 
focussed on use of sports drinks, type consumed, frequency of and reason for consumption and 
where drinks were purchased.   
Results: 160 children responded (87% response rate). 89.4% (143) claimed to drink sports 
drinks, half drinking them at least twice a week. Lucozade Sport™ was the most popular brand. 
The main reason for consuming the drinks was attributed to the “nice taste” (90%, 129/143).  
Most respondents purchased the drinks from local shops (80.4%, 115) or supermarkets (54.5%, 
78). More boys claimed to drink sports drinks during physical activity (77.9% versus 48.6% 
girls, p<0.001). Whereas more girls claimed to drink them socially (51.4% versus 48.5% boys, 
NS).   
Conclusion: A high proportion of children consumed sports drinks regularly and outside of 
sporting activity. Dental health professionals should be aware of the popularity of sports drinks 
with children when giving health education advice or designing health promotion initiatives.

INTRODUCTION 
Sports drinks have become more popular over recent years with the younger generation1,2.  In 
the 1970s, marathon runners were discouraged from drinking any fluids as it was thought it 
would slow the runners down. But, now runners are being encouraged to “drink ahead of 
thirst”3 with the recognition that hydration is associated with performance.  Sports drinks are 
designed to improve performance and hydrate elite adult athletes taking part in endurance and 
intense sporting events4.  There is no evidence of beneficial effects in non-elite athletes or 
children3.  However, these drinks are being consumed by the general population during 
physical activity and socially.   It is the latter which is the most cause for concern5, particularly 
amongst children aged under 163.  
 
The marketing of sports products has become a multibillion-dollar industry6.  In 2014, the UK 
sports drinks market was worth £218 million and the core consumers were 15-24 year olds1.  
However, the marketing campaigns ignore the detrimental impact sports drinks have on teeth 
and the effects they can have on general health. Certain marketing campaigns have even misled 
consumers into incorrectly concluding that the drinks contained no carbohydrates or additives6.  
In addition, studies have shown that while certain supplements in sports drinks can potentially 
improve performance, many have not been proven to be beneficial and some have harmful 
side-effects6.  
 
If consumed socially and in large quantities, sports drinks can lead to serious problems, such 
as obesity, diabetes, heart disease and gout7, as well as poor oral health4. Studies in the past 
have shown that non-athletes are consuming these drinks simply because of their nice taste2. 
 
Sports drinks contain both free sugars and acids4, hence these drinks have the ability to cause 
both dental caries and erosion. There is a strong relationship between eating foods high in 
“free” sugars and dental caries8-11.   The term free sugars refers to all mono and disaccharides 
added to foods by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, 
fruit juices and syrups12. Many sports drinks have a pH below 5.5, the critical pH for the 
demineralisation of enamel, leading to erosion13,14. Dehydration associated with physical 
activity increases erosion risk, as the buffering capacity is inhibited due to lower salivary flow4. 
Dehydration also reduces clearance of acids and sugars from the tooth surface, affecting both 
erosion and caries4. 
  
3 
The frequency and duration of sports drinks consumption are also important factors impacting 
on dental health15. The general consensus is that the frequency and amount of sugary food and 
drinks should be reduced and, when consumed, limited to mealtimes16.  Certain sports drinks, 
e.g. Powerade zero™, are marketed as being sugar free. However, these drinks still have an 
acid content that can lead to erosion of enamel13,14. 
 
A study conducted in the dental clinic at the Olympic Park during the London 2012 Olympics 
assessed the general oral hygiene of 278 participating athletes17. The authors reported that 55% 
of the athletes treated had dental caries and 45% had dental erosion (as measured by the Basic 
Erosive Wear Examination). This is a much higher prevalence than the experience of “tooth 
wear” recorded by the UK Adult Dental Health Survey in 200918 for similarly aged adults. 
Whilst the Olympic athletes came from the five continents17 the authors reported no significant 
difference in erosion by continental location or ethnicity. They also reported a link between the 
frequency of sports drinks use and dental erosion in anterior teeth17.   
 
Recent surveys have shown that Wales has higher levels of decayed, missing and filled teeth 
(DMFT/dmft) when compared with other areas in the UK, especially in children. In 2013, 52% 
of children aged 12 in Wales had at least one DMFT in their adult teeth compared with 32% in 
England19.  Of concern are the wide inequalities in experience, with children from more 
deprived areas experiencing higher levels of dental disease19, 20. 
 
There is confusion over the difference between energy and sports drinks. An energy drink is 
marketed for its mental stimulant effect and contains high levels of substances such as caffeine, 
taurine and glucoronolactone21. Sports drinks do not have a stimulant effect, but concentrate 
on providing carbohydrates, salts and hydration1,22. For the purpose of this study, the 
participants were not told what constitutes a sports or energy drink, as their knowledge of sports 
drinks was also being tested.  
 
According to Mintel (2014), 78% of UK 16-24 year olds have reported consuming a sports 
drink in the last 12 months, with 39% drinking them at least once per week1. From 1989–2008, 
the percentage of American children aged 6 to 11 consuming sports drinks increased 
significantly, from 2% to 12%. The amount of sports drinks consumed by these American 
children also increased, from 255 millilitres per day to 289 millilitres per day during the same 
timeframe2. 
  
4 
All school meal policies in the devolved countries of the UK have banned the sale of 
fizzy/sugary drinks other than fruit juices diluted with carbonated water23-26. Therefore students 
are accessing sports drinks from outside the school gates. 
 
Few studies have investigated the use of sports drinks in children, their knowledge about the 
product and the impact they may have on their oral health.  The aim of this study was to 
investigate the use of and knowledge surrounding sports drinks by 12-14 year old school 
children in South Wales, UK.  This paper reports on consumption aspects only; the knowledge 
component is reported separately. 
 
 
  
5 
METHOD 
This study consisted of a questionnaire survey of 12-14 year old school children recruited from 
a convenience sample of four secondary schools in South Wales. Schools were selected to 
reflect the range of deprivation experienced within the area (according to the Welsh Index of 
Multiple Deprivation, WIMD 201127). School A was a private school; School B a 
comprehensive school, whose catchment area draws from the most deprived areas in Wales; 
Schools C and D were also comprehensive schools, but their catchment area drew from a more 
mixed demographic27.  Furthermore schools C and D provided male and female education one 
separate sites. 
 
Prior to the commencement of this study ethical approval was gained from the Dental School 
Ethical Committee at Cardiff University. 
 
A focus group of eight adolescents (aged 12 – 16) was undertaken to inform the questionnaire 
design.  Participants were informally asked whether they drank sports drinks and why? 
 
With information gained from the focus group, a self-complete anonymous questionnaire was 
designed containing mainly closed questions, allowing categories to be analysed efficiently 
and with minimum bias28.  
 
Questions reported in this paper were designed to assess: 
 
1. whether respondents consume sports drinks and if so how often and what types? 
2. where and when respondents purchase and consume sports drinks? 
3. why respondents consume sports drinks? 
 
Children from school years 8 (12-13 years old) and 9 (13-14 years old) were invited to take 
part in the study from each of the selected schools.  Headmasters from each school were asked 
to nominate one class per school year to take part. A combination of school consent, parental 
negative consent and child assent was used in this study. Respondents were told that 
participation was voluntary before they completed the questionnaire.  One researcher (DB) was 
present at each school to distribute and collect the questionnaires and also to answer any 
questions about the project.  
 
  
6 
The data were analysed using appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics, such as 
frequency distributions and chi-squared test for categorical variations (with an alpha value of 
0.05 accepted as significant). Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 
(Version 20) software.  
 
RESULTS 
 
Demographic details of the schools and the number of participants from each school and year 
are presented in Table 1.  183 questionnaires were distributed amongst the four schools. In 
total, 160 respondents completed the survey (87% response rate); one Year 8 class from school 
A was unable to take part because of the timing for exams coinciding with data collection. The 
majority, 89.4% (143/160), of respondents claimed to drink sports drinks. The analyses below 
relate to the responses from those (n=143) who claimed to drink sports drinks. 
 
Consumption of sports drinks, frequency and type 
Almost half of these respondents drank them more than once a week (48.3%, 69); 14% (20) 
drinking one or more every day. The modal consumption frequency was 2-3 times a week 
(Figure 1). 
 
Respondents were asked to indicate which of the four bestselling UK sports drinks (Lucozade 
Sport™, Powerade™, Gatorade™, LSV®) they consumed and an “other” category was also 
provided.  The most popular drink was Lucozade Sport™ (88.8%, 127) whilst Gatorade™ was 
the least popular (9.8%. 14, Figure 2). 
All but one response to the “Other” category were “energy” drinks, not marketed as “sports” 
drinks.  These energy drinks were Relentless©, Monster®, Red Bull©, Power-up™, Original 
Energy Drink, Rockstar Energy drink™, Emerge, No Fear™ and Boost energy drink. The only 
“other” sports drink was an unbranded isotonic drink. 
 
Location of purchase 
The purchase locations for the sports drinks are presented in Figure 3; there were 242 locations 
mentioned by 143 respondents who reported drinking them, allowing multiple purchase 
location responses.   
 
  
7 
Most of the sports drinks were being purchased in local shops, with 115 (80.4% of 
respondents). Supermarkets were also popular with 78 mentions, which equated to 54.5% of 
respondents. The four mentions of “Other” were; bakery, Home Bargains, Spar and Lidl. 
 
Context of consumption 
Respondents were asked in which situation they drank sports drinks limited to 5 categories 
which were isolated during the focus group discussion (Figure 4).   
 
There was a clear gender difference, far more boys than girls consumed sports drinks during 
physical activity and at meal times (Figure 4). One respondent failed to state their gender on 
the questionnaire resulting in n=142 for this analysis. The majority of boys (77.9%, 53 
respondents out of 68) reported drinking these products during physical activity compared 
with only 48.6% (36 respondents out of 74) of girls (p<0.001).  However, more girls drank 
sports drinks at home (41.9% of girls compared with 32.4% of boys) and socially (51.4% of 
girls compared to 48.5% of boys); neither of these results were statistically significant 
(p>0.05).  These results reflect responses to respondent’s participation in sport. 86.8% 
(59/68) of male respondents participated in sport compared with 71.6% (53/74) of female 
respondents. 
 
Reasons for consuming sports drinks 
The most popular reason for consuming sports drinks was the taste of the product (90.2% 
129/143).  Energy and hydration were reasons given by 47.6% (68/143) and 23.1% (33/143) 
of respondents respectively. The fact that sports drinks enhance performance was only stated 
by 18.2% (26/143) as a reason for consumption (Figure 5).  
 
Approximately one third (32.9%, 47/143) of respondents stated price as a reason for purchasing 
sports drinks (Figure 5). When questioned how much they would spend, the majority would 
spend between 50p and £1 for a sports drink (55.9% of respondents). 38.5% would pay over 
£1 for a sports drink. 
 
DISCUSSION 
The results obtained clearly show a high proportion of adolescents in South Wales are 
consuming sports drinks.  
  
8 
The reported prevalence of sports drinks consumption for 12-14 year olds participating in this 
study was high at 89%, with 68% of these children drinking them regularly (1-7 times a week).  
Both the prevalence and the frequency of consumption in this age group appear to have 
increased in recent years29, 30 .   
In the late 1990s a study of 418 14 year old secondary school children in Birmingham, recorded 
a prevalence of 44%, with 77% of these consuming sports drinks 1-7 times per week29.  Whilst 
a larger UK study in the North West of England, of 2,385 14 year old children in 1999, reported 
81% drinking sports drinks occasionally or regularly30. 
 
Mintel market analysis data (52 weeks ending 1 March 2014) indicated that Lucozade™ 
represents 63% of the sports drink market, followed by Powerade™ taking 14% and own label 
and others taking 23%1.  This was reflected by the younger population of this study where 
Lucozade™ and Powerade™ predominated. However just under half of the sample reported 
drinking LSV® which was not separately identified by the Mintel data - this may be a reflection 
of the fact that LSV® is labelled as an Energy Drink but marketed as  
 
“a functional beverage, specially developed for periods of increased mental and 
physical exertion” 31.   
 
When questioned why they drink sports drinks, 90% claimed the taste was a factor where only 
18% of the respondents claimed it was due to the performance enhancing effect. This mirrors 
findings of the US Healthy Eating Research Review in 20122 and Food Standards Australia 
New Zealand in 201032, which found people were consuming these drinks simply because they 
tasted nice.  Taste of these sports drinks was the primary factor given by this group of 12-14 
year olds and appears to be the main reason why they appeal to younger consumers.  
Improvements in physical performance was given as a reason for drinking by a minority of 
participants, even though over 71.6% of girls and 86.8% of boys in this study claimed to be 
taking part in exercise. 
 
The results also showed that about a half of the respondents who drink sports drinks claim to 
drink them socially. This is likely to be linked to the fact that consumer independence is well 
developed and also the fact that the influence of peers (whilst socialising) is particularly strong 
  
9 
for this age-group33. This has implications for dental and wider public health, in terms of dental 
caries, dental erosion and obesity. 
 
Most of the children (80%) purchased sports drinks in local shops, once again highlighting the 
influence of stores surrounding the school fringe in the availability of “less healthy” foods and 
beverages, including sports drinks – often available at value prices34,35. Indeed, price itself was 
the third most recorded reason for purchase. Of concern, 26% and 6% of children cited leisure 
centres and schools as purchase sources. In the UK in recent years holistic food and health 
policies35,36 have come to the fore, where local government, health and third sector agencies 
work together to address food, health and exercise. These can involve whole school approaches 
to food and health and the promotion of healthier choices in leisure centres37. However, these 
findings appear to suggest that there is room for improvement, similar to experiences in other 
parts of the UK38. 
 
Whilst the majority of participants claimed to drink sports drinks, it became apparent that there 
was some confusion over the definition of a sports versus an energy drink. However from a 
dental and wider health perspective these two drinks types have similar detrimental effects due 
to their high free sugar (unless sugar free) content and low pH.   
 
In supermarkets and local shops, sports drinks are sold alongside other sugar sweetened 
beverages. This could indicate to children and parents that they are meant for use by everyone. 
Where these drinks are sold in shops should be re-assessed, so as to ensure people do not 
misunderstand the purpose of the product. The prices of these drinks also needs to be 
considered; the recent lobby by Public Health England39 and others for a sugar tax on sugar 
sweetened beverages was successful in March 201640. 
 
The fact that sports drinks are so popular with children because of their sweet taste as opposed 
to reasons associated with sport (which are tenuous) should add weight to the case for an excise 
duty on sweetened beverages incorporating sports drinks. 
 
CONCLUSION 
A high proportion of children consumed sports drinks regularly and outside of sporting activity. 
Dental health professionals should be aware of the popularity of sports drinks with children 
when giving health education advice or designing health promotion initiatives.
