OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiologic characteristics of sports- and recreation-related 
eye injuries among children in the United States.
METHODS: Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System were analyzed in a 
retrospective study of children ≤17 years of age treated in US emergency departments for 
sports- and recreation-related eye injuries from 1990 to 2012.
RESULTS: From 1990 through 2012, an estimated 441 800 (95% confidence interval: 378 868–
504 733) children were treated in US emergency departments for sports- and recreation-
related eye injuries, averaging 26.9 injuries per 100 000 children. Children 10 to 14 and 15 
to 17 years old had the highest rate of eye injury. Three-fourths of injuries were sustained 
by boys. The most common types of injury were corneal abrasion (27.1%), conjunctivitis 
(10.0%), and foreign body in the eye (8.5%). Most eye injuries were treated and released 
(94.6%); however, 4.7% were hospitalized. The most common sports and recreation 
activities and equipment associated with eye injury were basketball (15.9%), baseball and 
softball (15.2%), and nonpowder guns (10.6%). The overall rate of eye injury decreased 
slightly during the study period; however, the rate of eye injury associated with nonpowder 
guns increased by 168.8%, and nonpowder gun-related eye injuries accounted for 48.5% of 
hospitalizations.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric sports- and recreation-related eye injuries remain common. Increased 
prevention efforts are needed, especially for eye injuries associated with nonpowder guns. 
Increased child, parent, and coach education, as well as adoption of rules that mandate the 
use of eye protective equipment should be undertaken.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: Sports and 
recreation activities and equipment are associated 
with approximately one-fourth of all pediatric 
eye injuries. Basketball, baseball or softball, and 
football, in particular, are commonly associated with 
eye injury. Boys account for the majority of these 
injuries.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: The overall rate of eye 
injury decreased slightly during the 23-year study 
period; however, the rate of eye injury associated 
with nonpowder guns increased by 168.8%, and 
nonpowder gun-related eye injuries were often 
serious, accounting for 48.5% of hospitalizations.

 Participation in sports and recreation 
provides numerous physical, social, 
emotional, psychological, and 
educational benefits.1 However, these 
activities also place participants at 
risk for injury, including injuries 
to the eye. Sports and recreational 
activities account for a substantial 
proportion of all eye injuries in the 
United States.2 
– 
6 Authors of 1 study 
found that 24.4% of all pediatric eye 
injuries treated in US emergency 
departments (EDs) were related to 
sports and recreation.6 Basketball, 
baseball and softball, and football, in 
particular, are commonly associated 
with eye injury.7, 
 
8
Although sports- and recreation-
related eye injuries are not  
typically life-threatening,  
they can result in significant 
morbidity, including vision loss. 
Injury is one of the most common 
causes of monocular blindness, 
and ∼7% of eye injury patients will 
have severe vision impairment.9 
Although injuries may be common 
in sports, ∼90% of sports-related 
eye injuries can be prevented by 
wearing appropriate eye and facial 
protection.10, 
 
11
By using National Electronic  
Injury Surveillance System  
(NEISS) data from 1990 to 2012, 
the objective of this study was 
to investigate the epidemiologic 
characteristics of pediatric sports- 
and recreation-related eye injuries 
treated in US EDs. This study  
expands on previous eye injury 
research by focusing specifically  
on sports- and recreation-related  
eye injury characteristics and trends 
over a 23-year study period.
MethODs
Data source
Data were obtained from the NEISS 
for children ≤17 years of age treated 
in US EDs from 1990 to 2012. The 
NEISS is a nationally representative 
stratified probability sample of 
∼100 EDs and is maintained by 
the US Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC).12 Each patient 
record contains information 
regarding sex, age, body region 
injured, diagnosis, locale of the 
injury event, disposition from the 
ED, consumer product or activity 
associated with the injury, date 
of injury, and a brief narrative 
describing the circumstances of the 
incident.
case selection criteria
NEISS cases in which the injured 
body region was coded 77 (“eyeball”) 
and the product code was included 
in the product grouping “Sports 
and Recreational Activities and 
Equipment, 
” as identified by the 
2011 CPSC Annual Report, 
13 were 
evaluated for inclusion in the  
study (n = 14 866). The brief 
narrative for each case was  
reviewed to ensure the injury 
occurred to the globe of the  
eye as a result of participating  
in a sport or recreational activity. 
Injuries to the eyelid, eyebrow,  
orbit, eye area, or other parts  
of the face without mention  
of an eye globe injury and cases  
in which the mechanism of  
injury involved repairing or 
maintaining sports or recreation 
equipment, such as welding  
on an all-terrain vehicle (ATV), 
inflating a tire, or using a  
screwdriver to repair a bicycle, 
were excluded from the study  
(n = 1338).
Narratives were also reviewed 
for cases with the injured body 
region coded as 76 (“face, including 
eyelid, eye area, and nose”) and 
a product code included in the 
“Sports and Recreational Activities 
and Equipment” grouping. Of 
these 1030 cases, 278 were 
included, representing patients 
with injuries to multiple regions 
of the face, including an injury to 
the globe of the eye. For example, 
a patient could present with facial 
lacerations and a subconjunctival 
hemorrhage from being hit with a 
baseball bat. In this instance, the 
facial lacerations would be coded 
as the primary injury, but the case 
would be included in this study 
because of the subconjunctival 
hemorrhage.
Case selection identified 13 806 cases 
in the database involving sports- and 
recreation-related eye injuries among 
children ≤17 years of age from 1990 
to 2012.
study Variables
Consistent with previous pediatric 
eye injury studies, 
6 patients were 
grouped into the following 4 age 
categories: (1) 0 to 4 years, (2) 
5 to 9 years, (3) 10 to 14 years, 
and (4) 15 to 17 years.4, 
 
6 Locale 
of the injury event was grouped 
into the following categories: (1) 
place for sport or recreation, (2) 
home (including home, apartment, 
condo, and mobile home), (3) 
school, (4) other (including other 
public property, farm or ranch, 
and street or highway), and (5) 
not specified. Activity and product 
codes were grouped based on the 
categories in the 2011 CPSC Annual 
Report for “Sports and Recreational 
Activities and Equipment.” 
13 
For the purposes of this study, 
snow skiing was combined with 
toboggans, sleds, snow discs, etc; 
trampolines were combined with 
playground equipment; archery 
was combined with darts; dancing 
was combined with gymnastics; 
boxing was combined with martial 
arts; and nonpowder guns include 
BB, pellet, and paintball guns. The 
20 sports and recreation activities 
most frequently associated 
with eye injury were analyzed 
individually, with the remaining 
activities grouped into an “other 
sports and recreation activity” 
category. Disposition from the ED 
was categorized as: (1) treated and 
released (including examined and

 released without treatment), (2) 
hospitalized (including patients 
who were treated and admitted, 
transferred for hospitalization  
or to another hospital, or held  
for observation), (3) left  
against medical advice, and  
(4) not specified.
Case narratives were manually 
reviewed individually to code 
a specific eye injury diagnosis, 
mechanism of injury, and the object 
responsible for the injury. NEISS 
diagnosis codes and narratives 
were both used to code a specific 
diagnosis as: (1) corneal abrasion; 
(2) conjunctivitis; (3) foreign body; 
(4) hyphema; (5) subconjunctival 
hemorrhage; (6) laceration or 
puncture; (7) iritis or keratitis;  
(8) visual blurring or vision loss;  
(9) other diagnosis (including  
burn, retinal detachment, corneal 
edema, abrasion or contusion  
not specified, and other eye 
injuries); and (10) not specified. 
Mechanism of injury was  
coded as: (1) hit, struck, or poked; 
(2) object or small particle in the 
eye; (3) shot; (4) contact with 
chemical; (5) fell; (6) struck eye 
against object; (7) scratched or 
scraped; (8) other mechanism;  
and (9) not specified. The object 
directly responsible for causing  
the eye injury was coded as:  
(1) ball, puck, or birdie; (2) bat,  
club, stick, pole, or racquet; (3) 
BB, pellet, or paintball; (4) small 
particle(s) (such as dirt, sand, 
glass, etc); (5) another person or 
body region; and (6) other or not 
specified.
statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by using SPSS 
24.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM 
Corporation, Armonk, NY). Statistical 
analyses included relative risks 
(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) and simple linear regression 
(to evaluate the statistical 
significance of secular trends). The 
estimated slope from the regression 
model was reported along with 
the associated P value. Statistical 
tests were considered significant 
at α ≤ .05. The overall injury rate 
per 100 000 US population was 
calculated by using the US Census 
Bureau July 1 population estimate 
from 1990 to 2012, and the annual 
injury rates were calculated using 
the corresponding July 1 annual 
population estimates for each year 
within the study period.14 NEISS 
weights provided by the CPSC 
were used to calculate national 
estimates, and all reported numbers 
in this article are stable national 
estimates unless stated otherwise. 
According to the CPSC, an estimate 
is potentially unstable if the sample 
size is <20 cases, the estimate is 
<1200 cases, or the coefficient of 
variation is >33%. The institutional 
review board at the authors’ 
institution determined that this 
study was exempt.
Results
General characteristics
An estimated 441 800 (95% CI: 
378 868–504 733) children ≤17 
years of age were treated in US EDs 
for a sports- or recreation-related 
eye injury from 1990 to 2012, 
averaging 19 209 children annually, 
with an overall injury rate of 26.9 
injuries per 100 000 US children. 
The overall rate of eye injury 
decreased slightly (slope = −0.25, 
P = .003) during the 23-year study 
period (Fig 1). Injury rate trends 
for the top 5 sports and recreation 
activities associated with eye 
injuries are given in Fig 2. Although 
the rate of eye injury remained 
relatively constant for football 
(slope = −0.004, P = .731), the rate 
decreased for basketball (slope =  
−0.08, P = .001) and baseball 
and softball (slope = −0.17, P < 
.001). The injury rate increased by 
169.6% (slope = 0.13, P < .001) for 
nonpowder guns and 142.3% (slope =  
−0.06, P = .001) for swimming 
during the study period. Children 
10 to 14 and 15 to 17 years of age 
had the highest rate of overall eye 
injury (Fig 3). The rate of injury 
decreased among 0- to 4-year-
olds (slope = −0.23, P < .001), 
5- to 9-year-olds (slope = −0.23, 
P = .028), and 10- to 14-year-olds 
(slope = −0.37, P = .017). Despite 
annual fluctuations, the rate  
of eye injury did not significantly 
change for 15- to 17-year-olds

 (slope = −0.38, P = .063) over the 
study period.
Three-fourths (75.2%) of sports- 
and recreation-related eye injuries 
were sustained by boys (Table 1), 
and 42.9% of injuries occurred 
among children 10 to 14 years old. 
The mean age was 11.0 years (SEM: 
0.07; median: 11.0; interquartile 
range: 7.7–13.8). The most common 
types of injury were corneal 
abrasion (27.1%), conjunctivitis 
(10.0%), and foreign body in the 
eye (8.5%). Eye injuries most 
frequently occurred at a place for 
sport or recreation (26.1%) and at 
home (20.3%). Most eye injuries 
were treated and released (94.6%); 
however, 4.7% were hospitalized. 
The most common eye injuries 
resulting in hospitalization were 
laceration or puncture (22.9%), 
hyphema (16.8%), and foreign 
body (15.1%). Among the cases 
of foreign body that resulted 
in hospitalization, 70.4% were 
associated with BBs, pellets, or 
paintball guns. The most common 
sports and recreation activities 
and equipment associated with eye 
injury were basketball (15.9%), 
baseball and softball (15.2%),  
and nonpowder guns (10.6%) 
(Table 2). More than half (53.6%)  
of all eye injuries resulted from 
being hit, struck, or poked  
(Table 1). The most common  
object responsible for injury was 
a ball, puck, or birdie (24.6%), 
followed by a small particle(s) 
in the eye (12.4%). The majority 
(53.4%) of eye injuries occurred 
in the spring and summer months 
(April through August).
sex and age
Boys accounted for the majority of 
injuries in each of the 4 age groups 
(Table 1), with children 0 to 4 years 
old having the largest proportion 
of girls (34.0%) (Table 1). Corneal 
abrasion was the most common 
specific diagnosis among 0- to 4-year-
olds (23.7%), 5- to 9-year-olds 
(28.0%), 10- to 14-year-olds (26.1%), 
and 15- to 17-year-olds (29.1%).  
However, conjunctivitis represented 
a greater proportion of cases among 
0- to 4-year-old patients (16.1%)  
than among 10- to 14-year-old  
(8.9%; RR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.40–2.31)  
and 15- to 17-year-old (6.7%; RR: 
2.41; 95% CI: 1.75–3.34) patients.  
Likewise, the proportion of 0- to 
4-year-old patients with a foreign 
body (13.9%) was greater than that 
of 5- to 9-year-old (8.6%; RR: 1.61;  
RR: 1.23–2.11), 10- to 14-year-old 
(8.1%; RR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.32–2.23), 
and 15- to 17-year-old (7.3%; RR:  
1.91; 95% CI: 1.43–2.55) patients.  
A similar proportion of children  
were hospitalized in each of the  
4 age groups (Table 1).
Among children 0 to 4 years old, the 
most common sports and recreation 
activity and equipment associated 
with eye injury was playground 
equipment or trampolines (28.1%),

 followed by swimming activity, 
pools and equipment (15.2%) and 
bicycles (10.0%) (Table 2). Baseball 
and softball was the most common 
activity and equipment category 
associated with eye injury among 
5- to 9-year-olds (17.3%) and 10- to 
14-year-olds (17.2%). Basketball 
(28.8%) and nonpowder guns 
(10.8%) were the most common 
activity and equipment categories 
associated with eye injury among 
children 15 to 17 years old. Hit, 
struck, or poked was the most 
common mechanism of injury in all 
4 age groups (Table 1). Patients 0 
to 4 years old (22.6%) had a higher 
proportion of injuries because of 
objects or small particles in the eye 
compared with 5- to 9-year-olds 
(13.5%; RR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.38–
2.04), 10- to 14-year-olds (10.9%; 
RR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.71–2.49), and 
15- to 17-year-olds (9.1%; RR: 
2.47; 95% CI: 1.92–3.19). Patients 
0 to 4 years old also had a higher

to falls (10.6%) than 5- to 9-year-
olds (5.3%; RR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.47–

type of sports and Recreation 
activity and equipment
Boys sustained 96.4% of eye injuries 
associated with wrestling, 92.6% 
associated with football, and 90.7% 
associated with nonpowder guns. The 
activity and equipment categories 
with the highest proportion of 
injured girls were the dance, 
gymnastics, cheerleading, or baton 
category (77.6%); volleyball (52.3%); 
and the swimming activity, pools 
and equipment category (41.7%). 
Basketball accounted for the largest 
proportion of subconjunctival 
hemorrhage (26.9%) and corneal 
abrasion (23.4%). Hyphema (33.2%) 
and laceration or puncture (22.6%) 
were most commonly related to 
nonpowder guns. More than half 
(52.5%) of conjunctivitis cases were 
associated with swimming activity, 
pools and equipment. Corneal 
abrasion was the most common 
injury associated with baseball 
and softball (16.8%) and football 
(30.7%). Together, baseball and 
softball (20.5%) and nonpowder 
guns (20.5%) accounted for 41.0% 
of iritis or keratitis cases. The 
most common injury associated 
with playground equipment or 
trampolines was corneal abrasion 
(30.6%), followed by foreign body 
(29.3%).
Nearly half (48.5%) of eye injuries 
that required hospitalization were 
associated with nonpowder guns. 
Of these, 79.2% were associated 
with BB or pellet guns and 19.3% 
were associated with paintball 
guns. Nonpowder gun-related 
eye injuries were nearly 8 times 
more likely to be hospitalized than 
injuries associated with other 
sports and recreation activities and 
equipment (21.7% versus 2.7%; 
RR: 7.93; 95% CI: 6.61–9.53). Hit, 
struck, or poked in the eye was 
the most common mechanism of 
injury for all sports and recreation 
activities and equipment, except 
for nonpowder guns (shot: 96.0%); 
swimming activity, pools and 
equipment (contact with chemicals: 
67.0%); playground equipment or 
trampoline (object in eye: 50.1%); 
ATV, moped, minibike, etc (object 
in eye: 49.8%); and bicycle (fell: 
33.9%, and object in eye: 33.4%). 
Basketball (53.8%) and football 
(14.5%) accounted for more than 
two-thirds of eye injuries for which 
another player or body region was 
responsible. Hit, struck, or poked in 
the eye with a ball, puck, or birdie

 accounted for 71.6% of baseball- 
and softball-related eye injuries.
DIscussIOn
Nationally, on average, more than 
19 000 children were treated in EDs 
for sports- and recreation-related 
eye injuries each year during the 
study period. There was an overall 
slight decrease in the annual 
number of these injuries during 
these years, which coincided with 
a decrease in participation in many 
youth sports during this period.15 
Although the number and rate of 
eye injuries decreased during the 
study period, these injuries remain 
common among children. Consistent 
with previous studies, this study 
found basketball, baseball and 
softball, and nonpowder guns to 
be the most common sports and 
recreation activities and equipment 
associated with pediatric eye 
injury.7, 
 
8 According to the National 
Eye Institute, the sports with the 
highest rate of eye injuries are 
baseball and softball, ice hockey, 
racquet sports, and basketball.10 
In this study, basketball accounted 
for the largest proportion of 
patients with subconjunctival 
hemorrhage and corneal abrasion. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) and American Academy 
of Ophthalmology (AAO) classify 
basketball as a sport with high risk 
for eye injury and recommend all 
participants wear eye protection 
with polycarbonate lenses.16 Despite 
these recommendations, protective 
eyewear for basketball players is not 
required by the National Federation 
of State High School Associations 
(NFHS)17 and does not seem to be 
popular among athletes at all levels 
of play. The culture and tradition of 
the sport may prevent parents and 
coaches from encouraging protective 
eyewear use. Although the rate 
of basketball-related eye injuries 
decreased during the study period, 
more than 3000 basketball-related 
eye injuries were treated in US EDs 
annually. Increased education of 
parents, coaches, athletic directors, 
and athletes about the benefits of 
using protective eyewear is needed. 
In addition, NFHS should consider 
revising its policies to require 
protective eyewear for basketball 
players.
Baseball and softball was the 
second most common activity 
associated with eye injuries in 
this study. Despite the decrease in 
the rate of baseball- and softball-
related eye injuries during the 
study period, on average, there 
were 2900 ED visits annually for 
baseball- and softball-related eye 
injuries, and 71.6% of these  
injuries were associated with 
being hit or struck by the ball. 
This underscores the importance 
of adhering to AAP and AAO 
recommendations for protective 
eyewear use, which include 
facemasks attached to batter 
and base runner helmets and 
polycarbonate faceguards for 
fielders.16 The NFHS mandates  
the use of facemasks on batting 
helmets in softball but these  
are optional in high school  
baseball and Little League.18, 
 
19 
Although faceguards for defensive 
players are allowed in high school 
baseball and Little League, they 
are not required.20, 
21 Similar to 
basketball, education regarding the 
importance of wearing appropriate 
protective eyewear and consistent 
protective equipment rules across 
all ages may help prevent eye 
injuries associated with baseball 
and softball.
Findings from this study indicate 
that prevention of nonpowder 
gun-related eye injuries deserves 
special attention. The rate of  
eye injury associated with 
nonpowder guns increased  
169% during the study period, 
and these injuries accounted for 
almost half of all hospitalizations. 
Indeed, eye injuries associated 
with nonpowder guns were nearly 
8 times more likely to result in 
hospitalization than eye injuries 
associated with other sports  
and recreation activities and 
equipment. The AAP and AAO  
do not have specific 
recommendations for eye 
protection when using BB and 
pellet guns; however, they do 
recommend wearing eye protection 
meeting the ASTM standard  
F1776 when using paintball  
guns.22 It is important for  
children to be taught to shoot BB 
and pellet guns at paper or  
gel targets with a backstop  
that will trap BBs or pellets and 
prevent ricochet, as well as wear 
eye protection that meets the 
American National Standards 
Institute and International Safety 
Equipment Association standard 
Z87.1-2015 or the ASTM standard 
F2879-16.23, 
 
24 Both parents and 
children should be educated on 
proper safety precautions when 
handling and using guns, and 
appropriate adult supervision 
should be provided.
This study has several limitations. 
Injury estimates were based on 
patients who visited an ED for 
care; patients who were seen at 
an urgent care or other medical 
setting are not captured in the 
NEISS data set. Therefore, this 
study underestimates the actual 
number of injuries. In addition, 
this ED-based study may not 
be representative of the entire 
spectrum of sports- and recreation-
related eye injuries. The NEISS 
provides a separate code for the eye 
and the face (which includes eyelid, 
eye area, and nose). Although there 
are coding inconsistencies among 
NEISS coders, we individually 
reviewed case narratives for both 
eye and face injuries to ensure, to 
the best of our ability, that only 
injuries to the eye were included 
in the study. There were also 
PEDIATRICS Volume 141, number 2, February 2018

Downloaded from 
 inconsistencies in the content of 
case narratives, especially related 
to the object causing injury. 
Finally, data were not available 
regarding the number of children 
who actively participated in all the 
sports and recreational activities 
included in this study; therefore, 
census data were used to calculate 
population-based injury rates. 
Despite these limitations, this 
study provides a comprehensive 
epidemiologic description of sports- 
and recreation-related eye injuries 
among children over a 23-year 
study period by using a large, 
nationally representative sample.

cOnclusIOns
Pediatric sports- and recreation-
related eye injuries remain common. 
Increased prevention efforts are 
needed, including child, parent, and 
coach education, along with adoption 
of rules that mandate the use of eye 
protective equipment to decrease 
sports- and recreation-related eye 
injuries among children. The severity 
and increasing rate of eye injuries 
associated with nonpowder guns 
underscore the need for special 
preventive efforts directed toward 
this source of pediatric eye injury. 
Future research to assess the success 
of these efforts will be needed.
