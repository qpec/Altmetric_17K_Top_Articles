Abstract Magnesium, which is an essential trace element
that plays a key role in several cellular processes, is a major
component of bone; however, its relationship with risk of
major bone fractures is uncertain. We aimed to investigate
the association of baseline serum magnesium concentra-
tions with risk of incident fractures. We analyzed data on
2245 men aged 42–61 years in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart
Disease prospective cohort study, with the assessment of
serum magnesium measurements and dietary intakes made
at baseline. Hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals (CI)]
for incident total (femoral, humeral, and forearm) and
femoral fractures were assessed. During a median follow-
up of 25.6 years, 123 total fractures were recorded. Serum
magnesium was non-linearly associated with risk of total
fractures. In age-adjusted Cox regression analysis, the
hazard ratio (HR) (95% CIs) for total fractures in a com-
parison of the bottom quartile versus top quartile of mag-
nesium
concentrations
was
2.10
(1.30–3.41),
which
persisted on adjustment for several established risk factors
1.99 (1.23–3.24). The association remained consistent on
further adjustment for renal function, socioeconomic sta-
tus, total energy intake, and several trace elements 1.80
(1.10–2.94). The corresponding adjusted HRs for femoral
fractures were 2.56 (1.38–4.76), 2.43 (1.30–4.53) and 2.13
(1.13–3.99) respectively. There was no evidence of an
association of dietary magnesium intake with risk of any
fractures. In middle-aged Caucasian men, low serum
magnesium is strongly and independently associated with
an increased risk of fractures. Further research is needed to
assess the potential relevance of serum magnesium in the
prevention of fractures.

Introduction
Magnesium is an essential trace element that plays a key
role in several cellular processes including nucleic acid
synthesis, enzymatic reactions, and cell replication. It is
also an important component of bone, with 67 percent of
total body magnesium known to be found in the bone tissue
[1]. A number of factors are known to play an important
role in bone health and these include ageing, heritability,
sex, physical activity, hormonal factors and nutrition [2].
Investigations of the effect of nutrition on bone health
has mostly focused on specific dietary factors such as
calcium and vitamin D. There have been suggestions that
magnesium might also be linked with bone heath. In both
human and animal experimental models, magnesium defi-
ciency has been shown to be associated with decreased
osteoclastic and
osteoblastic activity, osteopenia
and
skeletal fragility [3, 4].

 Although it appears that magnesium may have a ben-
eficial effect on bone health, its relationship with fractures
is uncertain. It has been postulated that magnesium may
be involved in the development of fractures via (1)
modulation of osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity; [5]
(2) its effects on bone density and fragility; [3] and (3)
alteration in levels of other micronutrients such as calcium
and vitamin D [1, 5], which are needed for bone health. A
number of epidemiological as well as clinical studies have
reported dietary magnesium intake and magnesium sup-
plementation to be linked to greater bone mineral density
[6–9], suggesting that magnesium may be associated with
risk of fractures. In an analysis of the Norwegian Epi-
demiologic Osteoporosis Studies (NOREPOS) hip fracture
database, Dahl et al. [10] demonstrated a protective
association between magnesium in drinking water and risk
of hip fractures. However, a recent meta-analysis of 12
studies, has demonstrated that high intakes of magnesium
were not associated with risk of hip and total fractures
[11]. Given the inconsistent evidence on the association
between dietary magnesium and fracture risk and the
dependence of serum magnesium concentrations on diet-
ary magnesium sources as well as water [12, 13], it would
be clinically useful to ascertain if serum magnesium
concentrations are linked to fracture risk. Data however on
the association between serum magnesium status and risk
of major fractures is sparse. In a longitudinal analysis of
the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition (EPIC)–Norfolk cohort, Hayhoe et al. demon-
strated
statistically
significant
trends
between
serum
magnesium concentrations and risk of fractures; however,
the associations were attenuated to null after adjustment
for
confounding
factors
[14].
Fractures
(particularly
osteoporotic fractures) are one of the leading worldwide
causes of disability and morbidity, especially among the
aging population, and increase the burden on health sys-
tems [15]. The prevention of fractures is therefore of
public health importance and the evaluation of putative
risk factors such as serum magnesium, which may have
predictive or causal relevance to the risk of fractures and
which could help tailor preventive and therapeutic inter-
ventions is a priority. In this context, our first objective
was to assess the shape, nature, and magnitude of the
prospective association between serum magnesium with
risk of incident total and femoral fractures. The second
objective was to assess the consistency of the association
in important clinical subgroups using a population-based
cohort of 2245 relatively healthy men from eastern Fin-
land. In subsidiary analysis, we assessed the association of
dietary magnesium intake with the risk of fractures in the
same set of participants.
Methods
This

guidelines
for

studies in epidemiology (online Appendix 1) [16].
Study population
The Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease (KIHD) population-
based prospective cohort analyzed in this study was set up
primarily to investigate risk factors for cardiovascular disease
and other additional health outcomes in eastern Finland [17].
This cohorthas been described indetailpreviously;[17–19] in
brief, the KIHD cohort consisted of a representative sample of
3433 randomly selected men aged 42–61 years living in the
city of Kuo-pio and its neighbouring rural communities who
participated in the baseline study conducted between March
1984 and December 1989. Of the 3433 men, 3235 were found
to be eligible; and of this number, 2682 (78%) volunteered to
participate, 186 did not respond to the invitation, and 367
declinedtogiveinformedconsent.Thedatasetanalyzedinthe
present study includes 2245 men with baseline data on serum
magnesium, relevant covariates, and fracture outcomes. The
ethical committee of the University of Eastern Finland
approved all procedures involving human subjects and each
study participant provided written informed consent accord-
ing to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Ascertainment of incident fractures
All incident fractures, representing all femoral, humeral,
and forearm fracture cases that occurred from enrollment to
2014 were included. The primary outcome measures
included incident total and femoral fractures. No losses to
follow-up were recorded. In the KIHD study, participants
are under annual continuous surveillance for the develop-
ment of new outcome events, including fractures [20].
Fracture incidence data were collected from the National
Hospital Discharge Register data by computer linkage and
a comprehensive review of hospital records, discharge
diagnoses, and inpatient physician claims. The events were
coded according to the International Classification of Dis-
eases Tenth Revision diagnostic codes for fractures by site.
Measurement of risk factors
Methods for collection of blood specimens and the mea-
surement of lipids, biochemical analytes, and all trace
elements have been previously described in detail [21].
Briefly, besides fasting overnight before blood collection,
594

 participants were told to abstain from drinking alcohol for
at least 3 days and from smoking for at least 12 h before
assessment. Serum samples collected were stored frozen at
-80 �C for 0.2–2.5 years. Serum magnesium was mea-
sured using atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer
Zeeman 5000, Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) which
involved the use of acetylene-air (1:4) flame technique.
Serum magnesium was diluted in a ratio of 1:50 with
distilled water. The wavelength was 185.2 nm for magne-
sium. The between-run Coefficient of Variation for the
method was 2.4% (37 assays) [22]. The measurement of
pH-corrected serum ionized calcium concentrations was
made using ion selective electrodes (Microlyte 6, Kone,
Finland; CV 1.6%). Measurement of serum zinc concen-
trations were made using the PerkinElmer 306 atomic
absorption
spectrophotometer
(Norwalk,
Connecticut,
USA). Participants completed self-administered health and
lifestyle questionnaire for the assessment of age, smoking,
alcohol consumption, socio-economic status (SES), base-
line diseases, and medical history [21]. Energy expenditure
of physical activity was assessed using the validated KIHD
12-month
leisure-time
physical
activity
questionnaire
[23, 24]. Dietary magnesium, energy, and other nutrient
intakes were assessed quantitatively at the time of blood
sampling by recording food intake over 4 days using a
validated questionnaire [25]. During dietary assessment,
common sets of household measures were used to help the
participants assess food portion sizes. Instructions were
given and completed food records were checked by an
experienced nutritionist. The average of the 4 days dietary
intake was calculated. Food intakes were converted into
nutrient intakes using the Nutrica software (version 2.5;
National Public Health Institute, Turku, Finland), which
uses mainly Finnish values of nutrient composition of
foods and takes into account loss of vitamins during food
preparation. The Nutrica software contains a large database
comprising 1300 food items and dishes and the nutrient
composition of foods, including dietary magnesium. The
Nutrica software was developed at the Research Center of
the Social Insurance Institution of Finland.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were presented as means (SD) or
median (interquartile range) for continuous variables and
percentages for categorical variables. Cross-sectional cor-
relations of serum magnesium levels with various risk
markers were determined by calculating partial correlation
coefficients adjusted for age. Cox proportional hazard
regression models were used to conduct time-to-event
analyses. Schoenfeld residuals were used to confirm the
proportional hazards assumptions [26]. To characterize the
shape of the association between serum magnesium and
risk of total fractures, hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated
within quartiles of serum magnesium concentrations and
plotted against the mean serum magnesium concentrations
within each quartile. Floating variances were used to cal-
culate 95% confidence intervals for the log hazard ratio in
each group, including the reference group, to allow for
comparisons across the groups irrespective of the arbi-
trarily chosen reference category (top quartile) [27]. As the
association showed a non-linear shape, HRs were calcu-
lated by quartiles defined according to the baseline distri-
bution of serum magnesium concentrations. Hazard ratios
were progressively adjusted for (1) age; (2) plus body mass
index (BMI), height, systolic blood pressure (SBP),
smoking status, history of diabetes mellitus, and physical
activity; and (3) plus estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR), as calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease
Epidemiology Collaboration formula [28], SES, energy
intake, serum zinc, serum potassium, and serum ionized
calcium. These confounders were selected based on their
previously established role as risk factors for fractures,
evidence from previous research, or their potential as
confounders based on known associations with fracture
outcomes and observed associations with serum magne-
sium using the available data [29]. Collinearity diagnostics
using the variance inflation factor [30] showed no evidence
of collinearity between BMI and height. We evaluated
effect modification by pre-specified clinically relevant
characteristics using interaction tests. To avoid potential
bias due to participants at high risk of fractures at baseline,
we carried out sensitivity analyses that excluded the first
5 years of follow-up. All statistical analyses were con-
ducted using Stata version 14 (Stata Corp, College Station,
TX, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics and correlates of serum
magnesium levels
Table 1 summarizes characteristics of the study population
(n = 2245). The mean (SD) serum magnesium levels and
dietary magnesium intake at baseline were 1.98 (0.15) mg/
dl and 417.2 (69.3) mg/day respectively. Based on the
suggested normal reference range of 1.8–2.3 mg/dl for
serum magnesium [31], 136 (6.1%) men had hypomagne-
semia (
\
1.8 mg/dl) and only 22 (1%) men had excess
serum magnesium levels (
[
2.3 mg/dl) in the study popu-
lation. The mean (SD) age and BMI of study participants
were 53 [5] years and 26.9 (3.6) kg/m2 respectively. Serum
magnesium levels were weakly and inversely correlated

 function. Weak positive correlations were observed for
age, total cholesterol, creatinine, zinc, and serum ionized
calcium. No significant correlation was observed with
dietary magnesium intake. Online Appendix 2 shows
baseline characteristics of study participants by quartiles of
serum magnesium. Except for a few characteristics, there
were generally no significant differences in baseline char-
acteristics across quartiles of serum magnesium.
Magnesium and risk of fractures
During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 25.6
(17.6–27.9) years, 123 incident total fractures (annual rate
2.49/1000 person-years at risk; 95% CI 2.08–2.97) were
recorded. Of the 22 men who had excess serum magnesium
concentrations at baseline, none of them experienced a
fracture at follow-up; and of the total number of incident

 fractures, 78 were femoral fractures. In analyses adjusted
for several established risk factors (age, body mass index,
height, systolic blood pressure, smoking, history of dia-
betes, alcohol consumption, and physical activity), a non-
linear inverse association was observed between serum
magnesium and risk of total fractures (Fig. 1). Comparing
the bottom quartile versus top quartile of serum magnesium
concentrations, the age-adjusted HR for total fractures was
2.10 (95% CI 1.30–3.41; P = 0.003), which remained
consistent 1.99 (95% CI 1.23–3.24; P = 0.005) following
further adjustment for several established risk factors. The
HR was minimally attenuated to 1.80 (95% CI 1.10–2.94;
P = 0.019) on additional adjustment for eGFR, SES, total
energy intake, serum zinc, serum potassium, and serum
ionized calcium (Table 2). The association between serum
magnesium and total fractures was not significantly mod-
ified by several clinically relevant characteristics (P for
interaction C0.10 for each; Fig. 2). In a sensitivity analysis
which was limited to a sample of 2129 men (117 total
fractures) after the first 5 years of follow-up was excluded,
the
associations
remained
consistent:

1.19–3.21;
P = 0.008), and 1.77 (95% CI 1.07–2.93; P = 0.026)
respectively.
In analyses adjusted for several established risk factors,
there was a continuous association of serum magnesium
with risk of femoral fractures, which was potentially con-
sistent with either a curvilinear or linear shape (online
Appendix 3). The corresponding adjusted HRs for femoral
fractures were 2.56 (95% CI 1.38–4.76; P = 0.003), 2.43
(95% CI 1.30–4.53; P = 0.005), and 2.13 (95% CI
1.13–3.99; P = 0.019) respectively.
Based on the distribution of serum magnesium in the cur-
rent study and published guidelines which suggest a normal
reference range of 1.8–2.3 mg/dl [31], HRs for total and
femoral fractures were calculated using the following serum
magnesium categories: (1)\
1.8 mg/dl (group 1 and referent,
hypomagnesemia); (2) 1.8–2.0 mg/dl (group 2); and (3)
[
2.1 mg/dl (group 3). The inverse and independent associa-
tions of serum magnesium with the risk of total and femoral
fractures remained consistent (Table 3). In subsidiary analy-
ses using the bottom quartile of serum magnesium concen-
tration as a reference comparison, participants in the top
quartile of serum magnesium concentrations had a decreased
risk of both total and femoral fractures (online Appendix 4).
There was no evidence of an association of dietary
magnesium intake with risk of total and femoral fractures
(Table 4).

 Comment
Summary of findings
We have shown in this population-based prospective study
of middle-aged Caucasian men that low serum magnesium
concentrations
are
independently
associated
with
an
increased risk of future total and femoral fractures. Whiles
serum magnesium was non-linearly associated with risk of
total fractures, we observed a continuous decrease in risk of
femoral fractures with increasing levels of serum magne-
sium. Given the low event rate for femoral fractures, fur-
ther work is required to determine whether a curvilinear or
linear shape would better describe the relationship. The
associations persisted after controlling for several con-
founders including other trace elements such as serum zinc
and serum ionized calcium. There was also no evidence of
effect modification by several clinically relevant sub-
groups. In a subsidiary analyses, high serum magnesium
concentrations were associated with a reduced risk of
fractures and we found no evidence of an association of
dietary magnesium intake with risk of both total and
femoral fractures.
Comparison with previous work
Previous published articles exploring the prospective
association between serum magnesium and risk of fractures
are scarce. In the only study published to date to our
knowledge, investigators employing the large-scale EPIC
cohort were unable to show a statistically significant
association between serum magnesium concentrations and
risk of fractures after multivariable adjustment [14]. A
broad body of evidence suggests that magnesium has a
beneficial effect on bone health; however, the greater
majority of studies have explored dietary magnesium as an
exposure and not serum magnesium status. Although high
dietary magnesium intake has been linked with greater
bone mineral density [6, 8]; the evidence of a beneficial
effect on risk of fractures is not convincing. The majority
of studies including a recent pooled analysis of 12 studies
have consistently demonstrated that high dietary magne-
sium intake is not protective of risk of fractures [6, 11].
Indeed, our subsidiary analysis of dietary magnesium and
fracture risk showed statistically non-significant associa-
tions. In contrast, magnesium consumption in excess of the
recommended dietary allowance has also been shown to be
associated with an increased risk of lower-arm and wrist
fractures in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational
Study. The investigators however postulated that this might
be due to greater physical activity and risk of increased
falls in this group of women [6]. Whether the current
findings of an inverse association of serum magnesium
with fracture risk reflects a true association may need to be
confirmed in other large-scale prospective studies.
Possible explanations for findings
Though magnesium, the second most abundant intracellu-
lar cation, plays a role in several cellular processes; the
mechanistic pathways by which magnesium influences
bone metabolism are currently unclear. However pathways

 proposed that link low serum levels of magnesium to
increased fracture risk include impaired bone growth,
decreased bone density, and bone fragility or osteoporosis
[3]. Via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism, magnesium
has an effect on osteoblast activity and number of osteo-
clasts [5]. In selective dietary magnesium depletion in
animal models, Rude and colleagues observed bone loss,
decrease in osteoblasts, and increased osteoclasts in these
animals. Magnesium deficiency leads to resistance or low
vitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels [3, 32–34],
which may lead to reduced bone formation and subse-
quently increased risk of fractures. Magnesium also affects
bone metabolism by altering calcium homeostasis [1, 5].
Magnesium deficiency in animal models have been shown
to stimulate production of cytokines, which are known to
increase osteoclastic bone resorption. An increase in
receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL)
and a decrease in osteoprotegerin (OPG), both caused by
magnesium deficiency, cause an increase in bone resorp-
tion. Magnesium is known to stabilize and slow the
transformation
of
amorphous
calcium
phosphate
to
hydroxyapatite [35], which gives bones higher bone mass
[36]. Magnesium is essential for normal neurological and
muscular function [12]; low serum magnesium concentra-
tions (hypomagnesemia) may manifest as muscle weakness
and seizures [37], which lead to falls and subsequently
fractures. Several reasons could account for the null find-
ings demonstrated between dietary magnesium and risk of
fractures. First, observational studies of dietary intake are
prone to misclassification bias in addition to the fact that
food sources of magnesium are also frequently high in
nutrients such as potassium and calcium; which are bene-
ficial and interact with other micronutrients to maintain
bone health and therefore it is difficult to evaluate the
separate effect of each nutrient. Second, the possibility that
individuals dietary intake of magnesium may not correlate
with their total body stores or serum levels. Though a low
serum magnesium concentration generally signifies low
total body magnesium status; serum magnesium concen-
trations do not accurately reflect total body magnesium
stores [38, 39]. Thus, it is not uncommon to find normal
serum magnesium concentrations in the presence of
depleted total body stores and vice versa.
Implications of findings
The long-term prospective and independent association
demonstrated between baseline magnesium concentrations
and risk of fractures, suggest that serum magnesium status
may modify fracture risk and this may have implications
for clinical practice. The findings do suggest that avoiding
low serum concentrations of magnesium may be a
promising though unproven strategy for risk prevention of
fractures.
Although
serum
magnesium
concentration
depends on magnesium intake from food and water, sug-
gesting that increased intake may lead to increased serum
levels and reduced fracture risk, this is not supported by the
available evidence. Indeed, a number of studies including
the present analysis, have shown no correlation between
dietary magnesium intake and serum magnesium concen-
trations [14, 40]. It has been postulated this could be a
reflection
of
the
tight
homeostatic
control
of
the

 magnesium cation in the circulation [14]. In addition, it is
also known that the absorption and bioavailability of
minerals can be affected by interactions between different
dietary nutrients; such as the case of fibre, calcium, and
phosphorus for magnesium [41, 42]. Serum magnesium
concentration is regulated by a balance between intestinal
absorption
and
excretion
by
the
kidneys;
therefore,
decreased intestinal absorption, increased gastrointestinal
loss, or renal loss, may contribute to the lack of a corre-
lation between dietary intake and serum concentrations of
magnesium. Factors or conditions known to cause these
include old age, inflammatory bowel disorders, malab-
sorption syndromes, diabetes, certain medications (e.g.,
diuretics,
proton-pump
inhibitors),
as
well
as
renal
impairment [39, 43]. Based on these observations, modu-
lating or treating these underlying co-morbid conditions or
factors that predispose to low serum magnesium concen-
trations may subsequently help to prevent the development
of hypomagnesemia. Though hypomagnesemia is common
and its prevalence in the general population ranges from
2.5 to 15% [44], most patients are usually asymptomatic
and symptoms usually manifest only when the serum
concentrations fall below 1.2 mg/dl [45]. Since serum
magnesium concentration is not measured as part of the
routine blood screening panel, individuals with low serum
levels are difficult to identify. Serum magnesium screening
should therefore be conducted in the elderly and in situa-
tions such as chronic diarrhoea, hypocalcemia, hypokale-
mia, and other co-morbid conditions that predispose to low
circulating levels of magnesium. Magnesium supplemen-
tation may also be another way of increasing serum levels,
especially for people who are unable to get the recom-
mended dietary allowance from dietary sources. Though
the evidence is sparse, a number of human studies as well
as experiments in animal models have indeed shown that
magnesium supplementation is associated with improve-
ment in bone mineral density and suppression of bone turn
over markers [9, 46]. Sojka and Weaver [46] in their 2-year
magnesium supplementation study of a group of meno-
pausal women, concluded from their findings that magne-
sium therapy resulted in greater bone density and appeared
to have prevented the risk of fractures. The overall evi-
dence suggests that increasing serum magnesium concen-
trations may protect against the future risk of fractures;
however, well-designed magnesium supplementation trials
are needed to investigate these potential therapeutic
implications.
Strengths and limitations
The current analysis employed a large population-based
prospective cohort of men who were selected to be
nationally representative. The study sample had a high
response rate and there was complete follow-up for all
participants. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective
analysis that shows an independent and inverse association
between serum magnesium and incident fractures. Assay
measurements for serum magnesium employed atomic
absorption spectrometry which has a high level of preci-
sion. Other strengths of the current analysis include the
long follow-up period of over 20 years and comprehensive
analysis with adjustment for a broad panel of lifestyle,
nutritional and socioeconomic factors, and biochemical
markers enabling reliable assessments of the associations.
The research was limited because of the observational
nature of the study; the findings cannot be generalized to
women and other populations; inability to correct for
within-person
variability in serum magnesium
levels
because of absence of data on repeat measurements;
absence of data on other types of fractures such as vertebral
fractures; absence of data on fractures related to falls or
fall-related hospitalizations, given that low serum magne-
sium status leads to an increased risk of falls; inability to
adjust for other potential confounders such as vitamin D,
bone mineral density, use of medications, previous frac-
ture, and prevalent conditions such as thyroid disease,
crohn’s disease, coeliac disease, and myelomas which are
uncommon in the study population; and inability to repli-
cate the results in an independent cohort because this data
was not available. In addition, serum magnesium levels
does not necessarily reflect total body magnesium content
[47]; however, it is the best estimate of magnesium status
as it correlates with ionized and intracellular magnesium
[48].
Conclusion
Low serum magnesium concentrations is independently
associated with an increased risk of total and femoral
fractures in middle-aged Caucasian men. Further research
is needed to replicate these results in women and other
populations as well as assess the potential relevance of
serum magnesium in fracture prevention.
