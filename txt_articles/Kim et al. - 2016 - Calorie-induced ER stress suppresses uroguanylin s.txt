Calorie-induced ER stress suppresses uroguanylin satiety
signaling in diet-induced obesity
GW Kim1, JE Lin1, AE Snook1, AS Aing1, DJ Merlino1, P Li2 and SA Waldman1
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The uroguanylin-GUCY2C gut–brain axis has emerged as one component regulating feeding, energy
homeostasis, body mass and metabolism. Here, we explore a role for this axis in mechanisms underlying diet-induced obesity (DIO).
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Intestinal uroguanylin expression and secretion, and hypothalamic GUCY2C expression and anorexigenic
signaling, were quantified in mice on high-calorie diets for 14 weeks. The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in suppressing
uroguanylin in DIO was explored using tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a chemical
chaperone that inhibits ER stress. The impact of consumed calories on uroguanylin expression was explored by dietary
manipulation. The role of uroguanylin in mechanisms underlying obesity was examined using Camk2a-Cre-ERT2-Rosa-STOPloxP/loxP-
Guca2b mice in which tamoxifen induces transgenic hormone expression in brain.
RESULTS: DIO suppressed intestinal uroguanylin expression and eliminated its postprandial secretion into the circulation. DIO
suppressed uroguanylin through ER stress, an effect mimicked by tunicamycin and blocked by TUDCA. Hormone suppression by
DIO reflected consumed calories, rather than the pathophysiological milieu of obesity, as a diet high in calories from carbohydrates
suppressed uroguanylin in lean mice, whereas calorie restriction restored uroguanylin in obese mice. However, hypothalamic
GUCY2C, enriched in the arcuate nucleus, produced anorexigenic signals mediating satiety upon exogenous agonist administration,
and DIO did not impair these responses. Uroguanylin replacement by transgenic expression in brain repaired the hormone
insufficiency and reconstituted satiety responses opposing DIO and its associated comorbidities, including visceral adiposity,
glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to obesity in which calorie-induced
suppression of intestinal uroguanylin impairs hypothalamic mechanisms regulating food consumption through loss of anorexigenic
endocrine signaling. The correlative therapeutic paradigm suggests that, in the context of hormone insufficiency with preservation
of receptor sensitivity, obesity may be prevented or treated by GUCY2C hormone replacement.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a global pandemic and 41.5 billion adults are
overweight (body mass index 425 kg m − 2), 500 million of whom
are obese (body mass index 430 kg m − 2).1–3 Within the United
States, 69% of adults are overweight and 35% are obese, a figure
that has doubled over 20 years.4 The US health-care costs of
obesity are $147 billion, and within 15 years 20% of health-care
costs will reflect chronic diseases of obesity.2–5 These observations
underscore the unmet need for new management paradigms for
obesity and its comorbidities.
The hormone uroguanylin, whose expression is limited to small
intestine, has emerged as one component of a gut–brain axis
regulating
feeding,
energy
homeostasis,
body
mass
and
metabolism.6–8 Food consumption induces secretion of prour-
oguanylin from the small intestine into the circulation in mice and
humans, with delivery to the hypothalamus.8 There, the propep-
tide is proteolyzed to mature uroguanylin, where it interacts with
its only known receptor, GUCY2C, one of the cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP)-producing receptors.8 Indeed, intrave-
nous (i.v.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of GUCY2C
ligands induce satiety in wild-type (Gucy2c+/+) mice7,8 but not in
GUCY2C-deficient (Gucy2c-/-) mice.8 Beyond these anorexigenic
responses, an effect of i.c.v. uroguanylin on fecal output and the
generation of brown adipose tissue and energy expenditure has
been suggested.7 Together, these uroguanylin responses oppose
the development of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and the metabolic
syndrome.6–8
Although a contribution of the uroguanylin gut–brain axis to
the complex endocrine regulation of energy homeostasis and
body mass has emerged, a role for this axis in the pathophysiology
of obesity has not yet been explored. The present studies examine
a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to obesity in
which
calorie-induced
suppression
of
intestinal
uroguanylin
silences hypothalamic GUCY2C regulating satiety.

 access to food and water, unless otherwise noted. Generally, mice were
housed 3–5 in a cage, except for studies of daily food intake, where they
were housed in individual wire-mesh cages.8
Gucy2c–/– mice9 were backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice for more than 10
generations to produce Gucy2c–/– congenic C57BL/6J mice and wild-type
(Gucy2c+/+) littermates. Only colony-bred Gucy2c+/+ mice were compared
with Gucy2c–/– mice. These mice were used for studies of the effects of
GUCY2C ligand on c-Fos and Pomc expression.
For Rosa-STOPloxP/loxP-Guca2b mice, the Guca2b construct consisted of
the Rosa26 promoter sequence, a STOP cassette flanked by two loxP sites
and full-length Guca2b. Conditional expression in brain was selected to
examine the effects of uroguanylin on local hypothalamic, rather than
distal enterocyte, GUCY2C without the necessity of exogenous peptide
delivery. Thus, Camk2a-Cre-ERT2 mice were bred with Rosa-STOPloxP/loxP-
Guca2b mice to produce hemizygous Camk2a-Cre-ERT2-Rosa-STOPloxP/loxP-
Guca2b mice. Camk2a-Cre-ERT2 mice were bred with hemizygous
Camk2a-Cre-ERT2-Rosa-STOPloxP/loxP-Guca2b mice to produce Camk2a-
Cre-ERT2-Rosa-STOPloxP/loxP-Guca2b mice and littermate controls lacking
the
Rosa-STOPloxP/loxP-Guca2b
transgene.
Tamoxifen
(Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in sunflower seed oil (Sigma-Aldrich)
and administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (100 mg kg −1 per day)
for 5 days10 every 6 weeks to delete the floxed STOP cassette and express
Guca2b. These mice were used for studies of the effects of transgenic
uroguanylin replacement on appetite regulation.
Adiposity
Fat was dissected from subcutaneous (hind, interscapular) and visceral
(epididymal, mesenteric, perineal, retroperitoneal) fat pads and weighed.8
Chicken anti-uroguanylin antibody
A polyclonal chicken antibody against prouroguanylin (PU0247) was
produced by Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). The antigenic peptide,
QLESVKKLNELEEKEMSNPQ, was conjugated to bovine serum albumin,
injected with Freund’s complete adjuvant for primary inoculation or with
Freund’s incomplete adjuvant for two subsequent boosts. The peptide was
conjugated to Blue Carrier (Thermo), and injected with Freund’s complete
or incomplete adjuvant in two final boosts. IgY antibodies were purified
from egg yolks and validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Daily food intake
Mice were acclimated to individual cages with wire-mesh floors for
1 week.8 Food consumption was measured daily for 10 days and averaged
for each animal.
Diets
Rodent Diet 5010 (LabDiet, St Louis, MO, USA) is a low-calorie, standard-
chow (lean) diet (3.1 kcal g − 1, 12.7% calories from fat, 58.5% calories from
carbohydrates and 28.8% calories from protein); Diet 58Y1 is a high-calorie,
high-fat diet (5.1 kcal g − 1, 61.6% calories from fat, 20.3% calories from
carbohydrates and 18.1% calories from protein); and Diet 58Y2 is a
moderate-calorie, high-carbohydrate diet (3.8 kcal g − 1, 10.2% calories from
fat, 71.8% calories from carbohydrate and 18.0% calories from protein;
Supplementary Table S1). Mice were maintained on diets ad libitum from 6
to 20 weeks of age. In studies of reversible uroguanylin loss, mice were
either maintained on Diet 5010 or Diet 58Y1 for 18 weeks, or placed on
Diet 58Y1 for 14 weeks and then switched back to Diet 5010 for 4 weeks.
In studies with the ob/ob strain, mice were either allowed ad libitum
feeding or restricted to 3 g day of Diet 5010 for 6 weeks.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Mice were fasted for 16 h overnight, blood was collected before and after
1 h of refeeding and serum was isolated. A rabbit anti-prouroguanylin
antibody, 6912 (M Goy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC,
USA11), was used (1:1000) to coat Nunc-Immuno PolySorp plates (Thermo)
for 16 h at 4 °C. The prouroguanylin peptide (CQQKSGLLPDVSYNP) was
serially diluted (1:5) in Superblock T20 (phosphate-buffered saline)
Blocking Buffer (Thermo) and plated to generate a standard curve
(1 μg ml − 1 to 2.56 pg ml − 1). Serum samples were diluted (1:10) in
Superblock and plated. The peptide was biotinylated using EZ-Link
Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Thermo), diluted in Superblock and added to each
standard and sample. Plates were sequentially incubated for 30 min at 37 °C,
with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Thermo) for 30 min at 37 °C, with
1-Step
Turbo
TMB-ELISA
Substrate
Solution
(Thermo)
for
30 min
at room temperature, stopped with 1 M H3PO4 and absorbance quantified
at 460 nm.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
In some studies, mice were i.p. injected for 5 days with vehicle
(1% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline) or 1 mg kg − 1
per day of tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) to induce ER stress. In other
studies, mice were orally gavaged for 12 days with vehicle (1% dimethyl
sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline) or 150 mg kg − 1 per day of
tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA; Sigma-Aldrich) to relieve ER stress.
Hepatic steatosis
Livers were fixed with formalin for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, sectioned
to 5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Hepatic steatosis was
quantified by a blinded veterinary pathologist.12
Hypothalamic microdissection
Hypothalamic nuclei were microdissected using a stereomicroscope
according to stereotaxic coordinates.13
Immunoblot analyses
Antibodies for immunoblot analyses included the following: BiP, NPY,
phospho-VASPSer239, phospho-VASPSer157, β-actin, β-tubulin, glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and villin-1 (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA); Gucy2c (MS20)8 and prouroguanylin (6910, M Goy,
University of North Carolina).11 Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA) or Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA, USA), and SuperSignal West
Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate and Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate
were from Thermo. Band intensities were quantified by densitometry and
normalized to β-actin, β-tubulin, GAPDH or villin-1.
Immunostaining
Jejunum was fixed with formalin for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, sectioned
to 5 μm, mounted on glass slides, deparaffinized, rehydrated, subjected to
heat-induced antigen retrieval in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 8.5, blocked
with 5% milk and 1% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories)
in
phosphate-buffered
saline with
Tween-20
for
1 h,
incubated with a chicken anti-uroguanylin antibody (PU0247) and a rabbit
anti-β-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for 16 h overnight at
4 °C, incubated with fluorescently labeled anti-chicken and anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies (Thermo) for 90 min, coverslipped with VECTASHIELD
HardSet Mounting Medium with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and visualized using an EVOS FL Auto
Cell Imaging System (Thermo). Adjacent sections were stained with a
procedure that omitted anti-uroguanylin antibody as a negative control
(Supplementary Figure S1).
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test
Mice were fasted for 16 h overnight, and i.p. injected with glucose
(2 g kg − 1). Blood from the distal tail was placed on test strips 0, 15, 30, 60
and 120 min thereafter and glucose concentration quantified.
Intravenous peptide induction in hypothalamus
Employing conditions optimized previously,8 mice were fasted for 16 h
overnight and i.v. injected via the tail vein with 100 μl (10 μg) of the
GUCY2C peptide agonist, ST (NTFYCCELCCNPACAGCY; Bachem, Torrance,
CA, USA), or the inactive analog, TJU (NTFYAAELAANPAAAGAY; Bachem).
For gene expression studies, hypothalamus was harvested 45 min
following peptide injection,14 and Fos and Pomc mRNA quantified by
quantitative real-time PCR.8 For satiety, consumption of diet 58Y1 was
measured 1, 2 and 4 h following peptide injection and refeeding. For
vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation quantified
by immunoblot, hypothalamus was harvested 0.5, 5, 10 or 20 min
following injection.

 Reverse transcriptase-PCR
RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and
converted to complementary DNA using TaqMan Reverse Transcription
Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA, Thermo Scientific). The
complementary DNA was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR,
performed on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems), using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems)
and primer/probe sets from TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied
Biosystems) for: Fos (Mm00487425_m1), Guca2b (Mm01192051_m1), Gucy2c
(Mm01267705_m1), Npy (Mm03048253_m1), Pomc (Mm00435874_m1), Actb
(Mm01205647_g1), Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1) and Vil1 (Mm00494146_m1).
Relative expression was calculated with the 2–ΔΔCT method, using Actb, Gapdh
or Vil1 as a reference.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted in a blinded manner. Two-tailed Student’s
t-tests were used for single comparisons, and one or two-way analysis of
variance for multiple comparisons, as appropriate. Correlation of Gucy2c
expression
and
VASP
phosphorylation
was
analyzed
by
Pearson’s
correlation. Animal cohort sizes were calculated to be sufficient to detect
two-tailed statistically significant differences with 95% confidence and 90%
power, assuming unequal variances and allowing for unequal sample
sizes between groups. For these studies, animals were not randomized
to groups. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism
6 software (La Jolla, CA, USA), Po0.05 was considered significant and data
represent mean ± s.e.m.
RESULTS
DIO suppresses intestinal uroguanylin expression
To assess the integrity of the uroguanylin-GUCY2C circuit in
obesity, wild-type mice were placed on a high-fat diet to produce
DIO. Uroguanylin mRNA (Po0.01) and protein (Po0.0001) in
jejunum were reduced (45.4 ± 7.5% protein reduction) after
14 weeks on the high-calorie diet, compared with lean controls
on a low-calorie diet (Figures 1a–c and Supplementary Figure S1).
Furthermore, DIO was associated with a commensurate reduction
(43.1 ± 11.4%; Po0.001) in phosphorylation of VASP, a reporter
of GUCY2C-cGMP signaling,15 in jejunal epithelium (Figure 1d).
Moreover, DIO eliminated the postprandial increase in serum
uroguanylin (Po0.05; Figure 1e).
DIO suppresses uroguanylin by inducing intestinal ER stress
Chronic overnutrition is linked to ER stress in a variety of
tissues,16–18 and ER stress is implicated in pathophysiological
mechanisms involving metabolic hormones.19,20 Here, uroguany-
lin loss by DIO (Po0.01; Figure 2a) was associated with increased
expression of the canonical ER stress marker, BiP (GRP78,
HSPA5),21 in jejunal epithelia (Po0.001; Figure 2b). Furthermore,
induction of ER stress with i.p. tunicamycin recapitulated the
effects of DIO in lean mice.22 Indeed, tunicamycin increased BiP
(Po0.01; Figure 2c), confirming the induction of ER stress,
associated with uroguanylin loss (Po0.01; Figure 2d). Conversely,
relief of ER stress by oral TUDCA22 in obese mice on a high-fat diet
reduced BiP (Po0.05; Figure 2e) and restored uroguanylin
(Po0.01; Figure 2f).
Calories mediate uroguanylin loss in DIO
A diet high in carbohydrates and moderately high in caloric
density reduced uroguanylin mRNA (Po0.001; Figure 3a) and
protein (Po0.01; Figure 3b) expression, mirroring hormone loss
caused by the high-fat diet, without causing weight gain in lean
mice (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, switching obese
mice from a high- to a low-calorie diet restored uroguanylin
mRNA (Po0.001; Figure 3c) and protein (Po0.01; Figure 3d)
to
normal
levels
even
in
the
context
of
persistent
DIO
(Supplementary Table S2). Furthermore, restricting daily calories
consumed by obese hyperphagic ob/ob mice to levels typical of
lean mice23 increased uroguanylin mRNA (Po0.05; Figure 3e) and
protein (Po0.001; Figure 3f) even in the context of persistent
obesity (Supplementary Table S2).
Hypothalamic GUCY2C is preserved in DIO
GUCY2C expression was enriched in the arcuate nucleus (ARC;
Figures 4a and b), identified by expression of NPY and POMC
(Supplementary Figure S2),24–28 a key hypothalamic nucleus
regulating metabolic homeostasis29,30 and a central target for
peripheral energy signals.31 The i.v. injection of the GUCY2C-
specific ligand heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) induced phosphoryla-
tion of VASP in the hypothalamus at serine 239, which is cGMP
dependent, but not at serine 157, which is cAMP dependent
(Po0.001; Figure 4c). Furthermore, i.v. ST increased hypothalamic
expression of c-Fos (Po0.01) and POMC (Po0.05) in Gucy2c+/+,
but not in Gucy2c-/-, mice (Figures 4d and e). The transcription
factor c-Fos promotes POMC gene transcription,24,25 and POMC is
a key anorexigenic neuropeptide precursor in ARC signaling
(Supplementary Figure S2).26,27 These signaling events in the
hypothalamus complement the anorexigenic effects produced by
i.v. ST (Po0.01; Figure 4f). Importantly, unlike its effects on
intestinal uroguanylin, DIO did not reduce the expression of
Figure 1.

 hypothalamic GUCY2C (Figures 5a and b). Rather, hypothalamic
GUCY2C mRNA (Po0.05) and protein (Po0.001) levels were
higher in DIO mice compared with lean controls. Similar to
uroguanylin expression in intestine, this effect of DIO on GUCY2C
is reversible, and hypothalamic receptor levels were restored to
normal levels in obese mice switched to a low-calorie diet
(GUCY2C protein, Po0.01; Figures 5c and d). In DIO mice, i.v. ST
increased hypothalamic VASP phosphorylation that occurred
earlier and was greater as compared with lean mice (Po0.001;
Figure 5e). This increase in a reporter of GUCY2C stimulation
mirrored the increase in expression of GUCY2C itself (Figure 5f).
Moreover, anorexigenic signaling by hypothalamic GUCY2C was
preserved in DIO and i.v. ST reduced food intake in obese mice
(Po0.01; Figure 5g).
Transgenic uroguanylin reduces food intake, weight gain and
comorbidities in DIO
Uroguanylin loss with preservation of receptor sensitivity in DIO
suggests that hormone replacement could reconstitute GUCY2C-
mediated satiety. Local i.c.v. delivery of uroguanylin to the brain
activated hypothalamic GUCY2C, recapitulating satiety responses
produced by i.v. ligands7,8 (Po0.0001; Supplementary Figure S3).
Thus, mice were generated with a uroguanylin transgene under
the control of a brain-specific tamoxifen-inducible promoter
(Figures 6a and b) in order to target hypothalamic, but not
intestinal, GUCY2C without the necessity of peptide delivery.
Cohorts of mice with (+) and without (− ) the transgene received
the high-fat diet starting at 4 weeks of age, and body weights
followed for ~30 weeks (Figure 6c). By week 12, the difference
in cumulative weight gain of (− ) and (+) mice was 3.76 g
(95% confidence interval (CI) 2.34–5.17 g, Po0.001) or 24.43%
(95% CI 15.24–33.61%, Po0.001) of their baseline weight
(Supplementary
Table
S3).
By
week
24,
the
difference
in
cumulative weight gain was 5.63 g (95% CI 2.09–9.17 g, Po0.01)
or 36.61% (95% CI 13.59–59.63%, Po0.01; Supplementary Table
S3). Reduced weight gain was associated with a difference in daily
food consumption between ( − ) and (+) mice of 0.30 g (95% CI
0.14–0.45 g, Po0.001) or 10.97% (95% CI 5.26–16.68%, Po0.001)
after 30 weeks on a high-fat diet (Figure 6d). Stool water content
was identical in ( − ) and (+) mice, confirming that central
expression of transgenic uroguanylin did not induce intestinal
GUCY2C fluid secretion (Supplementary Figure S4). However,
comorbidities of obesity were lower in (+) compared with ( − )
mice including visceral adiposity (Po0.05; Figures 6e and f),
glucose intolerance (Po0.05; Figure 6g) and hepatic steatosis
(Figure 6h and Supplementary Figure S5).
DISCUSSION
The obesity pandemic continues to grow unabated and will soon
be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,
highlighting the unmet medical need for new disease manage-
ment paradigms.1–5 In the context of this burgeoning clinical
need, there is a paradoxical gap in understanding molecular
mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology of obesity that
can be targeted for therapy. The uroguanylin-GUCY2C gut–brain
axis has emerged as a regulator of feeding, energy homeostasis,
body mass and metabolism in normal physiology in rodents.6–8

Calories impair the anorexigenic uroguanylin axis

 Moreover, like mice, the consumption of nutrients induces
endocrine secretion of uroguanylin into the circulation as the
afferent limb of a gut–brain axis in humans as well.8 The present
studies reveal that DIO reduced intestinal uroguanylin expression
and eliminated its postprandial secretion into the circulation. In
contrast, hypothalamic GUCY2C expression and sensitivity was
increased in DIO, with preserved satiety responses induced by
cognate ligands. Indeed, hormone replacement with transgenic
uroguanylin expressed in brain restored anorexigenic signaling,
opposing the development of obesity and its comorbidities. These
observations suggest a previously unanticipated mechanism
contributing to the pathophysiology of obesity in which DIO
disrupts the uroguanylin gut–brain endocrine axis regulating
feeding, energy homeostasis and metabolism. However, preserva-
tion of hypothalamic GUCY2C in DIO suggests the feasibility of a
therapeutic paradigm involving cognate ligand replacement to
manage obesity and its comorbidities.
DIO reduced uroguanylin mRNA and protein in intestine,
associated with a commensurate reduction in VASP phosphoryla-
tion, a reporter of GUCY2C-cGMP signaling.15 Similarly, DIO
eliminated postprandial increases in serum uroguanylin, reducing
endocrine satiety signals to the hypothalamus.8 DIO-induced
uroguanylin loss was mediated by ER stress, reflected by increases
in the canonical marker BiP.21 Furthermore, tunicamycin, which
induces ER stress, mimicked DIO and reduced uroguanylin,
whereas TUDCA, a chemical chaperone that relieves ER stress,
restored
uroguanylin
in
DIO.22
In
that
context,
metabolic
disruption associated with glucolipotoxicity induces ER stress in
pancreatic β-cells, leading to degradation of insulin mRNA and
inhibition of insulin biosynthesis.32,33 In fact, insulin and urogua-
nylin share characteristics making them particularly susceptible to
ER dysfunction: both are synthesized as prepropeptides, depen-
dent on proper folding for function and secreted as endocrine
hormones.34,35 Importantly, the effects of DIO on hormone
expression were reversible, and returning mice on a high- to a
low-fat diet restored intestinal uroguanylin expression.
Suppression of uroguanylin expression appears to be mediated
by ingested calories, rather than the pathophysiological milieu of
obesity. Although chronic overnutrition with high-fat or high-
carbohydrate diets suppressed uroguanylin expression, cohorts
maintained on the high-fat diet developed obesity whereas those
on the high-carbohydrate diet maintained lean body weights.
Furthermore, reversing chronic overnutrition from a high-fat diet
by restricting calories restored uroguanylin levels in wild-type and
ob/ob mice, even though they remained obese. These observa-
tions reveal uroguanylin loss in the absence of obesity, and
hormone recovery despite the persistence of obesity, respectively.
They suggest that similar to pancreatic β-cells and insulin,32,33
overnutrition itself induces ER stress resulting in uroguanylin loss.
From these observations, it is tempting to suggest a management
strategy in obese patients in which calorie restriction restores
intestinal uroguanylin expression to reconstitute the GUCY2C
gut–brain axis that, in turn, creates a positive feedback loop
improving satiety, body weight and metabolism.
GUCY2C is expressed in hypothalamus6,8 and i.v. and i.c.v.
GUCY2C ligands mediate central satiety responses regulating
feeding in Gucy2c+/+ mice7,8 but not Gucy2c-/- mice.8 The
hypothalamus, which regulates homeostatic processes including
energy balance, encompasses nuclei with discrete functions.36
Among nuclei that regulate energy homeostasis, the ARC is a
primary integrator of neural and peripheral inputs, including
energy signals delivered by the circulation.37,38 In turn, the output
of the ARC includes orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides,
including POMC.39,40 Here, we reveal that GUCY2C is enriched in
the ARC. Furthermore, i.v. uroguanylin induces GUCY2C-specific
expression of POMC in the hypothalamus, a response primarily
restricted to the ARC (see Supplementary Figure S2).39,40 More-
over, these molecular responses are associated with the induction
of satiety by i.v. and i.c.v. uroguanylin.7,8 These observations for
the first time provide a topographic and mechanistic basis for the
regulation of feeding by hypothalamic GUCY2C.

 In contrast to uroguanylin, expression of hypothalamic GUCY2C
is preserved in DIO mice. Indeed, i.v. ST increased hypothalamic
VASP phosphorylation in DIO mice, revealing the persistent
responsiveness of hypothalamic GUCY2C to endocrine stimulation
in chronic overnutrition. Moreover, i.v. ST induced satiety in DIO
mice, demonstrating that endocrine sensitivity in the hypothala-
mus is preserved in the context of a chronic high-fat diet. Given
the role of uroguanylin in opposing DIO,6–8 and the potential role
of hypothalamic GUCY2C in mediating these responses,8 the
present study suggests a novel pathophysiological paradigm
contributing to calorie-induced obesity and its comorbidities.
Thus, although chronic overnutrition resulting in DIO produces
hormone insufficiency in the endocrine ‘gland’, reducing intestinal
uroguanylin expression, the function of the receptor GUCY2C at
the ‘end-organ’, the hypothalamus, is amplified. In turn, this model
of classical endocrine insufficiency should be amenable to
reconstitution
by
hormone
replacement.
Indeed,
transgenic
uroguanylin expressed in the brain reduced food consumption
and opposed obesity and its comorbidities in mice on a chronic
high-fat diet. Importantly, these effects were enduring, persisting
undiminished for up to 24 weeks, suggesting an absence of
desensitization of GUCY2C or its downstream signaling events by
transgenic hormone replacement.41 These observations highlight
the potential for hormone replacement with GUCY2C ligands for
durable management of DIO and its comorbidities.6–8
Targeting
GUCY2C
for
antiobesity
therapy
is
particularly
appealing because it leverages a novel endogenous endocrine
axis. Although the endogenous circuit is damaged, the impair-
ment is a hormone deficiency with preservation of receptor
function, and therapeutic strategies for hormone replacement are
conceptually
straightforward.
This
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
the anorexigenic endocrine hormones leptin and insulin, whose
serum concentrations rise in DIO, leading to chronic overstimula-
tion and cognate receptor desensitization, resulting in loss of
efficacy of these hormone receptor axes.42,43 Indeed, obesity is
pathognomonically associated with chronic hyperleptinemia and
hyperinsulinemia and hormone overexpression with receptor
desensitization has challenged efforts to employ these impaired
satiety circuits as therapeutic targets. These examples underscore
the importance of ensuring the integrity of the signaling system in
therapeutic strategies targeting obesity. Here, preserved GUCY2C
satiety signaling defines a system compatible with a strategy of
therapeutic hormone replacement.
Although uroguanylin has emerged as the key afferent limb of a
novel gut–brain axis regulating body mass, the precise central
mechanisms and efferent pathways mediating these effects
continue to be defined. In one study, i.c.v. uroguanylin failed to
regulate appetite.6 However, these studies used rats, a model for
which there is no experience in pharmacokinetic or pharmacody-
namic parameters of uroguanylin with respect to feeding, energy
homeostasis or body mass. More recently, uroguanylin delivered
by constant i.c.v. infusion for 7 days produced weight loss in
DIO mice that was independent of feeding but rather reflected
increases in vagus nerve-dependent fecal output and brown
adipocyte metabolic rate.7 Continuous supraphysiological con-
centrations of uroguanylin ( ~10−4–10−5 M),44 in vast excess of the
Kd of hormone-receptor binding (~10−9 M), likely induced long-
term desensitization of GUCY2C and its efferent regulation of
feeding.41 Supraphysiological concentrations of uroguanylin could
induce novel GUCY2C-independent effects, either through addi-
tional guanylyl cyclases expressed in the brain45 or through
receptors other than guanylyl cyclases.6,46 These observations
stand in contrast to transgenic uroguanylin replacement here that
produced hormone levels that induced durable anorexigenic
responses opposing weight gain for at least 24 weeks without
desensitization or alterations in the metabolic rate.8 These
considerations highlight the importance of defining efferent
mechanisms and central receptors that mediate them to maximize
therapeutic
opportunities
for
obesity
and
its
comorbidities
represented by the uroguanylin gut–brain axis.
Loss of intestinal uroguanylin expression with chronic over-
nutrition mirrors loss of intestinal GUCY2C hormones in colorectal
tumorigenesis.47 It is tempting to speculate that this represents
one molecular basis for the established association between
obesity and colon cancer,48,49 and highlights the role of GUCY2C
agonism underlying homeostatic physiology. Thus, reconstitution
of GUCY2C signaling by hormone replacement could restore
anorexigenic responses corrupted by DIO, reducing obesity and its
comorbidities. In turn, reduction of caloric intake could allow
recovery of endogenous GUCY2C ligand expression, promoting
GUCY2C agonism opposing both DIO and intestinal tumorigen-
esis. The implications for translation of these observations into
improvements in patient care underscore the importance of future
studies to address this compelling hypothesis.
