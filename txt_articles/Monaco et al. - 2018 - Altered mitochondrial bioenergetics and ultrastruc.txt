Abstract
Aims/hypothesis A comprehensive assessment of skeletal muscle ultrastructure and mitochondrial bioenergetics has not been
undertaken in individuals with type 1 diabetes. This study aimed to systematically assess skeletal muscle mitochondrial pheno-
type in young adults with type 1 diabetes.
Methods Physically active, young adults (men and women) with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c 63.0 ± 16.0 mmol/mol [7.9% ± 1.5%])
and without type 1 diabetes (control), matched for sex, age, BMI and level of physical activity, were recruited (n = 12/group) to
undergo vastus lateralis muscle microbiopsies. Mitochondrial respiration (high-resolution respirometry), site-specific mitochon-
drial H2O2 emission and Ca2+ retention capacity (CRC) (spectrofluorometry) were assessed using permeabilised myofibre
bundles. Electron microscopy and tomography were used to quantify mitochondrial content and investigate muscle ultrastructure.
Skeletal muscle microvasculature was assessed by immunofluorescence.
Results Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was significantly lower in participants with type 1 diabetes vs the control group,
specifically at Complex II of the electron transport chain, without differences in mitochondrial content between groups.
Muscles of those with type 1 diabetes also exhibited increased mitochondrial H2O2 emission at Complex III and decreased
CRC relative to control individuals. Electron tomography revealed an increase in the size and number of autophagic remnants in
the muscles of participants with type 1 diabetes. Despite this, levels of the autophagic regulatory protein, phosphorylated
AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPKαThr172), and its downstream targets, phosphorylated Unc-51 like autophagy activating
kinase 1 (p-ULK1Ser555) and p62, was similar between groups. In addition, no differences in muscle capillary density or platelet
aggregation were observed between the groups.
Conclusions/interpretation Alterations in mitochondrial ultrastructure and bioenergetics are evident within the skeletal muscle of
active young adults with type 1 diabetes. It is yet to be elucidated whether more rigorous exercise may help to prevent skeletal
muscle metabolic deficiencies in both active and inactive individuals with type 1 diabetes.

Introduction
Skeletal muscle accounts for almost half of our body weight
and, as such, is responsible for up to 75% of insulin-stimulated
glucose disposal after a meal [1, 2]. In fact, blood glucose
uptake into muscle and its subsequent conversion to glycogen
is a major determinant of insulin sensitivity [3, 4]. Given the
importance of skeletal muscle for glucose management, as
well as its vital role in insulin action, impairments in skeletal
muscle health in people with type 1 diabetes diminishes their
ability to mitigate dysglycaemic burdens, promotes the devel-
opment and progression of complications [5, 6] and, ultimate-
ly, expedites the accelerated physical disability that
characterises diabetes [7]. However, our understanding of
the impact of this chronic disease on the health/quality of
human skeletal muscle is extremely limited.
Mitochondria play a fundamental role in energy metabo-
lism and ATP production throughout the body. Based on their
role in fuel oxidation, mitochondria can also generate consid-
erable amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It remains
controversial whether impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial
respiratory function contributes to insulin resistance and
dysglycaemia in obesity and type 2 diabetes [8]. However, a
consistent observation has been increased mitochondrial ROS
in obese/type 2 diabetes relative to lean control individuals

 [8]. In addition, using 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS), people with type 1 diabetes have been shown to ex-
hibit slowed post-exercise ATP resynthesis [9–11]; the under-
lying mechanism(s) for this impairment is currently unknown
and would require a direct and comprehensive exploration of
site-specific mitochondrial respiratory function. Moreover, the
effect of type 1 diabetes on skeletal muscle ultrastructure, last
reported in 1977 [12], has not been re-examined since the
introduction of more aggressive insulin therapies (e.g. basal
and fast-acting insulins, insulin analogues and pump therapy),
and its effect on muscle mitochondrial ROS production re-
mains to be elucidated.
Here, we hypothesised that otherwise healthy, young adults
with type 1 diabetes would display site-specific decrements in
skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration, increased ROS pro-
duction and altered muscle ultrastructure relative to
non-diabetic controls.
Methods
Participants
Twelve untrained participants with type 1 diabetes were re-
cruited and closely matched with twelve participants without
diabetes (control group) for age, sex, BMI and level of phys-
ical activity. Demographics (Table 1) and participant number
was determined by power calculations from our previous stud-
ies in human muscle [13, 14]. All participants with type 1
diabetes used insulin (insulin pump or multiple daily injec-
tions) and reported no complications. Prior to giving informed
consent, all participants were given oral and written informa-
tion about the experimental procedures. All procedures were
approved by the Research Ethics Board at York University
(REB number e2013-032) and conformed to the Declaration
of Helsinki.
Study design
Participants reported to York University in the early morning
or early afternoon and were instructed to consume a
standardised meal 1.5–2 h prior to their visit. Participants with
type 1 diabetes were also instructed to continue their habitual
use of insulin. Upon arrival, body mass and height measure-
ments were taken to determine BMI, and a blood sample was
obtained using venepuncture, for HbA1c analysis. Skeletal
muscle samples were then obtained from the vastus lateralis
muscle by a microbiopsy percutaneous needle, as described
previously [13], and used for mitochondrial bioenergetic analy-
ses, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), histological
analysis and western blotting, as described below.
Mitochondrial bioenergetics
All mitochondrial bioenergetic experiments were performed
in vitro using permeabilised muscle fibres prepared from fresh
muscle samples that were immediately placed in ice-cold
BIOPS containing (in mmol/l): 50 MES, 7.23 K2EGTA,
2.77 CaK2EGTA, 20 imidazole, 0.5 dithiothreitol (DTT), 20
taurine, 5.77 ATP, 15 PCr and 6.56 MgCl2
.6H2O (pH 7.1), as
previously described in detail [13].
Mitochondrial respiration Using the Oxygraph-2k (Oroboros
Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria), high-resolution measure-
ments of mitochondrial oxygen consumption were conducted
in permeabilised myofibres placed in 2 ml of respiration me-
dium MiR05 [15], containing 0.5 mmol/l EGTA, 10 mmol/l
KH2PO4, 3 mmol/l MgCl2
.6H2O, 60 mmol/l K-lactobionate,
20 mmol/l Hepes, 20 mmol/l taurine, 110 mmol/l sucrose and
1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA (pH 7.1), at 37°C. Experiments
were conducted at an initial oxygen concentration of 350–
375 μmol/l with constant stirring at 750 rev/min. Respiration
medium was supplemented with 20 mmol/l creatine (C0780;

 Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) to enhance mitochondrial phos-
phate shuttling [16]. ADP-stimulated respiratory kinetics were
determined through ADP (A5285; Sigma) titrations in the
presence of 5 mmol/l blebbistatin (CAY13013; Cayman
Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), in order to prevent sponta-
neous contraction of fibres [13, 17, 18], 5 mmol/l pyruvate
(P2256; Sigma) and 2 mmol/l malate (M1000; Sigma).
Complex I kinetics were determined through standard pyru-
vate and glutamate (GLU303; BioShop, Burlington, ON,
Canada) titrations in the presence of 5 mmol/l blebbistatin,
5 mmol/l ADP and 2 mmol/l malate, while Complex II kinet-
ics were determined through standard succinate (S2378;
Sigma) titrations in the presence of 5 mmol/l blebbistatin,
5 mmol/l ADP and 10 μmol/l rotenone (R8875; Sigma; to
prevent superoxide generation at Complex I). During each
titration, Cytochrome c (192-10; Lee Biosolutions, Maryland
Heights, MO, USA) was added last to determine intactness of
the outer mitochondrial membrane. Any samples that
exceeded a 10% increase in respiration after Cytochrome c
addition were excluded [19].
Mitochondrial H2O2 emission Mitochondrial H2O2 emission
was measured fluorometrically (QuantaMaster 40; HORIBA
Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA) at 37°C in buffer Z [18], con-
taining 105 mmol/l K-MES, 30 mmol/l KCl, 10 mmol/l
KH2PO4, 5 mmol/l MgCl2
.6 H2O, 1 mmol/l EGTA, 5 mg/ml
BSA (pH 7.1), supplemented with 20 mmol/l creatine,
10 μmol/l Amplex UltraRed reagent (A36006; Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 0.5 U/ml horseradish per-
oxidase (P8375; Sigma) and 40 U/ml Cu/Zn superoxide dis-
mutase (SOD1; S9697; Sigma), as described previously [13].
Various sites were assessed by titrating the following sub-
strates [20, 21]: (1) 2.5 μmol/l antimycin (A8674; Sigma)
for assessment of Complex III; (2) 10 mmol/l pyruvate and
2 mmol/l malate, to assess Complex I via generation of
NADH; (3) 10 mmol/l succinate, to assess Complex I (via
reverse flow) via generation of FADH2; (4) 10 mmol/l pyru-
vate and 0.5 μmol/l rotenone, to assess pyruvate dehydroge-
nase complex (PDC); rotenone blocks NADH entry into
Complex I; and (5) 20 mmol/l glycerol-3-phosphate, for the
assessment of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydro-
genase (mG3PDH; G7886; Sigma). In addition, fibres used
for Complex I (pyruvate + malate), PDC and mG3PDH mea-

Mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity Mitochondrial Ca2+
retention capacity (CRC) was measured in duplicate,
fluorometrically (QuantaMaster 40; HORIBA Scientific),
at 37°C in buffer Y, containing 250 mmol/l sucrose,
10 mmol/l Tris-HCl, 20 mmol/l Tris base, 10 mmol/l
KH2PO4, 2 mmol/l MgCl2
.6H2O and 0.5 mg/ml BSA, with
1 μmol/l Calcium Green-5N (C3737; Life Technologies), as
described previously [23]. Briefly, Ca2+ uptake was initiat-
ed with 8 nmol pulses of Ca2+ (CaCl2) and then subsequent
pulses of 4 nmol Ca2+ were titrated until opening of the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) was ob-
served [23].
TEM
Fresh muscle was immediately fixed in 2% (vol./vol.)
glutaraldehyde (111-30-8; Electron Microscopy Sciences,
Hatfield, PA, USA) in 0.1 mol/l sodium cacodylate buffer
pH 7.4 (Canemco, Lakefield, QC, Canada) and processed
as described previously [24]. To quantify mitochondria,
representative micrographs from eight unique fibres (con-
taining a portion of the subsarcolemmal region adjacent to
the nucleus, with most of the image containing the
intermyofibrillar area) were acquired at ×15,000 magnifi-
cation. Blinded quantification of mitochondrial size (mean
area, μm2), distribution (number per μm2) and density
(μm2 × number per μm2 × 100) was achieved using
Nikon Imaging Software (NIS)-Elements AR (v 4.6;
Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) by manually outlining mito-
chondria and converting to actual size using a calibration
grid [25].
Electron tomography
Samples were oriented and trimmed to allow longitudinal
sectioning of fibres, which were visually localised.
Ultra-microtomy (Leica UC7; Leica Microsystems,
Wetzlar, Germany) was performed with a 35° diamond
knife (Diatome, Nidau, Switzerland), and 65 nm thick
sections were mounted onto copper slot grids (Plano,
Wetzlar, Germany). Electron micrographs for tomography
tilt series were acquired on a JEM-2200FS electron mi-
croscope (JEOL, Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) (200 kV)
equipped with a TemCam-F416 camera (TVIPS,
Munich, Germany) and using a 25 electron volt (eV) en-
ergy filter slit. Under-focus was adjusted to 4000 nm.
Micrographs were acquired two-fold binned for tomogra-
phy. The resulting pixel size was 2.4 nm. Tilt series was
collected over a total angular tilt range from −70° to +70°,
at 2° increments. Image series was aligned by patch track-
ing mode using the IMOD software package (v 4.7; http://
bio3d.colorado.edu/imod) [26]. A single reconstructed
volume was computed from each tilt series by radially
weighted back projection. A 3D density distribution
(tomogram) was obtained. A virtual section with a
24 nm thickness was generated with the slicer tool in
IMOD. Major organelles were coloured utilising Adobe
Photoshop CC 2015 by a blinded researcher.

 Histology and immunofluorescence analysis
Biopsied muscle was immediately embedded in Tissue Tek
optimum cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compound (4583;
VWR, Radnor, PA, USA), frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled
isopentane and stored at −80°C until analysis. Cryosections
(−20°C) that were 8 μm thick were transferred onto static-free
microscope slides (CA48311-703; VWR), allowed to air dry
and fixed with ice-cold 4% (wt/vol.) paraformaldehyde.
Sections were then incubated in blocking solution (5% [vol./
vol.] normal goat serum in 1X PBS; S-1000; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30 min and then
co-stained with CD31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion
molecule-1 [PECAM-1]) overnight. An antibody against
CD41 was added the following day and incubated for 1 h.
The appropriate secondary antibodies were then applied for
1 h: Alexa Fluor 594 and Alexa Fluor 488. Nuclei were coun-
terstained with DAPI. CD31 was used as a marker of capillary
content and CD41 to measure platelet aggregation. The anti-
bodies were validated by manufacturers for immunofluores-
cence analyses (see electronic supplementary material [ESM]
Table 1 for antibody details). H&E stains were used for the
determination of muscle fibre area in order to calculate capil-
lary:fibre ratio, as previously described [14]. Images were
captured with a Nikon 90 Eclipse microscope (Nikon) and
analysed using NIS-Elements AR software (v 4.6; Nikon) at
original magnification of ×40.
Western blotting
A portion of muscle was quickly snap-frozen and stored at
−80°C until analysis. Frozen muscle (~10–30 mg) was
homogenised with a tapered teflon pestle in ice-cold buffer
containing 40 mmol/l Hepes, 120 mmol/l NaCl, 1 mmol/l
EDTA, 10 mmol/l NAHP2O7·10H2O pyrophosphate,
10 mmol/l β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmol/l NaF and 0.3%
CHAPS detergent (pH 7.1, adjusted using KOH). Protein con-
centrations were determined using a BCA assay (Life
Technologies) and then loaded equally (50 or 100 μg), using
Ponceau S (P7170; Sigma) as a loading control. Proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluo-
ride membrane, blocked for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4°
C using commercially available antibodies validated by man-
ufacturers for western blotting: human total oxidative phos-
phorylation cocktail (OXPHOS; to detect individual com-
plexes of the electron transport chain [I, II, III, IV, V]), phos-
phorylated (Thr172) and total AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPKα), phosphorylated (Ser555) and total Unc-51-like
autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), sequestosome
(SQSTM1; herein referred to as p62) and vinculin. After over-
night incubation, membranes were washed in tris-buffered
saline, 0.1% (vol./vol.) Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse infrared
fluorescent secondary antibody (IRDye 800CW-conjugated)
for OXPHOS, and horseradish peroxidase conjugated second-
ary antibody for all other proteins (see ESM Table 1 for anti-
body details). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by in-
frared imaging (Odyssey CLx; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln,
NE, USA) or chemiluminescence (Gel Logic 6000 Pro
Imager; Carestream, Rochester, NY, USA) and quantified by
densitometry using Image J (v 1.51t; http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean ± SEM except for participant
characteristics, which are expressed as mean ± SD. An un-
paired two-tailed Student’s t test was performed for all exper-
iments except for CRC and mitochondrial respiration kinetics
where an unpaired one-tailed t test and a two-way ANOVA
were used, respectively. Significance was established at p ≤
0.05.
Results
Skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics
Control of oxidative phosphorylation by ADPADP is a prima-
ry regulator of mitochondrial bioenergetics and signals the net
cellular metabolic demand to mitochondria in times of ener-
getic stress. Therefore, we first determined if mitochondria
were sensitive to low, physiologically relevant concentrations
of ADP, as well as maximal concentrations (oxidative capac-
ity) in type 1 diabetes. We found that both sensitivity to low
ADP levels and maximal capacity for respiration were signif-
icantly lower (p < 0.05, main effect) in participants with type 1
diabetes compared with control participants (Fig. 1a).
Substrate-specific impairments We then determined if mito-
chondrial sensitivity to specific substrates was different in the
muscle of those with type 1 diabetes vs control individuals. No
detectable change in Complex I-supported mitochondrial respi-
ration was observed, as evidenced by the lack of a significant
difference in the sensitivity or capacity of the mitochondria to
oxidise pyruvate (an index of glucose oxidation) (Fig. 1b). This
suggests that mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate from glucose
is not impaired in type 1 diabetes, and neither is Complex I
oxidation of NADH from pyruvate dehydrogenase. There
were also no detectable changes in glutamate-supported
respiration (NADH oxidation) (Fig. 1c), which further sug-
gests there is no deficiency in Complex I activity in type 1
diabetes. In contrast, Complex II-supported respiration by
succinate (FADH2 synthesis) was significantly lower
(p < 0.001, main effect) at both low (sensitivity) and max-
imal (oxidative capacity) succinate concentrations in par-
ticipants with type 1 diabetes, suggesting a reduction in

 Complex II activity in type 1 diabetes compared with con-
trol individuals (Fig. 1d).
Mitochondrial H2O2 emission Next, we measured mitochon-
drial H2O2 emission potential. In the participants with type 1
diabetes, Complex III-supported mitochondrial H2O2 emis-
sion was significantly elevated (p < 0.05) compared with con-
trol participants but was not statistically different at Complex I
(reverse [succinate] and forward electron flow [pyruvate +
malate]), PDC and mG3PDH (Fig. 1e).
Skeletal muscle mitochondrial content
Considering that a reduction in mitochondrial respiration
can be caused by lower mitochondrial content, we next
examined the spatial organisation and abundance of mito-
chondria, as well as the expression of individual electron
transport chain proteins. Using TEM, no differences in
mean mitochondrial size, number of mitochondria per
muscle area or mitochondrial area density in either the
subsarcolemmal or intermyofibrillar regions of the muscle

Fig. 1 Skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics in young adults with
and without type 1 diabetes. Rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption
(JO2) were measured in permeabilised muscle fibres in the presence of
carbohydrate-derived substrates. (a) Submaximal and maximal (oxidative
capacity) ADP-stimulated respiration in the presence of pyruvate and
malate. Concentrations of ADP required to reach maximum varied be-
tween 6 and 18 mmol/l (both groups, n = 12). (b) Pyruvate-supported
respiration (Complex I sensitivity and oxidative capacity) in the presence
of 5 mmol/l ADP. Concentration of pyruvate required to reach maximum
varied between 6 and 38 mmol/l (control group, n = 11; type 1 diabetes
group, n = 9). (c) Glutamate-supported respiration (Complex I sensitivity
and oxidative capacity) in the presence of 5 mmol/l ADP. Concentration
of glutamate required to reach maximum varied between 4 and 20 mmol/l
(control group, n = 12; type 1 diabetes group, n = 8). (d) Succinate-sup-
ported respiration (Complex II sensitivity and oxidative capacity) in the
presence of 5 mmol/l ADP and rotenone. Concentration of succinate
required to reach maximum varied between 22 and 26 mmol/l (both
groups, n = 11). (e) Rates of mitochondrial H2O2 emission (mH2O2) de-

 were observed (Fig. 2a). Similarly, the levels of individ-
ual proteins were not significantly different between
type 1 diabetes and control participants (Fig. 2b, c),
further supporting no difference in total muscle mito-
chondrial content between the groups. Likewise, there
were no differences in p-AMPKαThr172 (relative to
total AMPKα; Fig. 3d), a known regulator of mitochon-
drial biogenesis [27]. Collectively, this data indicates
that the lower respiration per mg of muscle was not
due to reductions in mitochondrial content, suggesting
that impairments intrinsic to the mitochondria them-
selves might exist in people with type 1 diabetes.

Skeletal muscle mitochondrial Ca2+ tolerance
and electron tomography
We next tested Ca2+ handling within the mitochondria.
Opening of the mPTP has been linked to swelling and ener-
getic dysfunction [28]. We hypothesised that reductions in Ca2
+ handling within the mitochondria (i.e. reduced CRC) would
lead to an increased sensitisation of the mPTP and, ultimately,
attenuations in mitochondrial respiratory function. As
hypothesised, mitochondrial CRC was significantly lower (p
= 0.046) in skeletal muscle from participants with type 1 dia-
betes relative to control participants (Fig. 3a).
We next used electron tomography to assess the skele-
tal muscle ultrastructure. This powerful technique allows
for the 3D study of cellular architecture at the nanoscale
level. Consistent with our observed attenuations in mito-
chondrial respiration, electron tomography revealed irreg-
ularities in the organisation of cristae in the participants
with type 1 diabetes that were uncommon in control par-
ticipants (Fig. 3b; mitochondria and cristae highlighted in
red). Furthermore, consistent with the reductions in mito-
chondrial Ca2+ handling previously noted, the muscles
from participants with type 1 diabetes also exhibited an
increase in size and number of autophagic remnants com-
pared with the control group, and this was visible within
both the subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar areas (Fig.
3c; highlighted in purple and cyan, respectively). A close
association of autophagic remnants to intramyocellular
lipid droplets was also frequently observed in individuals
with type 1 diabetes (Fig. 3c; lipid droplets highlighted in
green). Despite these observations, no differences in the
autophagic regulatory protein p-AMPKαThr172 (as noted
previously) or its downstream targets p-ULK1Ser555 or
p62 were observed between groups (Fig. 3d–f).
Skeletal muscle microvasculature
To ascertain whether changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics
were the result of microvasculature loss and concomitant hyp-
oxia, capillary density was quantified by staining frozen mus-
cle sections with an antibody against CD31. No significant
difference between groups was observed, regardless of wheth-
er the data was collated as per cent density or ratio of total
number of capillaries to myofibre area (Fig. 4a). It was also
worth considering that, while capillary density may not be
diminished, the capillaries present may be obstructed given
the reported increases in prothrombotic factors, such as plas-
minogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), in type 1 diabetes [29].
We speculated that there may be greater prevalence of thrombi
within the capillaries of individuals with type 1 diabetes, con-
sequently resulting in a decreased regional blood flow. We
assessed platelet aggregation by co-staining frozen muscle
sections for CD31 and CD41. No significant difference be-
tween groups was demonstrated in the number of CD41+ areas
overlaying CD31+ cells (Fig. 4b) indicating that in this phys-
ically active, young adult cohort with type 1 diabetes, impair-
ments in skeletal muscle microvasculature did not mediate the
observed alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics and ultra-
structure. Moreover, this finding also suggests that deteriora-
tion in skeletal muscle quality may precede the eventual vas-
cular complications that arise in type 1 diabetes.

moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity per week) according
to the American and Canadian diabetes associations [30,
31]. Specifically, the work described herein demonstrates,
for the first time, site-specific alterations within the mitochon-
dria of young adults with type 1 diabetes compared with
(matched) control participants without diabetes. These alter-
ations in mitochondrial bioenergetics occur in the absence of a
loss of mitochondrial content or changes in skeletal muscle
microvasculature (as assessed by capillary density and platelet
aggregation). Furthermore, TEM investigations revealed that
type 1 diabetes negatively affects skeletal muscle ultrastruc-
ture, as evidenced by disorganised mitochondrial cristae and
an increased presence of autophagic remnants. These early
alterations precede the well-characterised complications (e.g.
cardiovascular disease, polyneuropathy) of type 1 diabetes
and occur in large, proximal muscle groups (in contrast to
distal limb muscles, which are more readily affected by
polyneuropathy), suggesting that the early alterations seen in
this study are unlikely to be owing to neuropathy but, instead,
intrinsic alterations in muscle, and that this skeletal muscle
metabolic dysregulation is a primary outcome of this chronic
disease that may contribute to dysglycaemia.
Skeletal muscle is not only the primary organ system re-
sponsible for physical capacity but is also a critical metabolic
organ since it is: (1) the major site of fatty acid catabolism
[32]; (2) a principal mediator of whole-body glucose homeo-
stasis [2]; and (3) a major determinant of whole-body insulin
sensitivity [2, 3]. Thus, impairments in skeletal muscle qual-
ity, particularly in conditions of metabolic disease (e.g. diabe-
tes mellitus), could have profound long-term consequences by
increasing the incidence of primary contributors to the devel-
opment of diabetic complications, such as recurrent
dysglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance [33–35].
Consistent with the importance of skeletal muscle in overall
health, if one considers other chronic diseases (e.g. heart dis-
ease and cancer), loss of muscle mass, strength and metabolic
function (referred to as cachexia) are commonly observed, and
this decline in muscle health is an important determinant in
overall survival [36, 37].
While changes in skeletal muscle health of rodent models
of type 1 diabetes has been more intensely studied (previously
referred to as ‘diabetic myopathy’ [38, 39]), the extent to
which this is happening in human skeletal muscle of those
with type 1 diabetes has yet to be fully elucidated [40]. In
the clinical diabetes literature, skeletal muscle mitochondrial
ATP synthesis is one of the most widely investigated vari-
ables, often assessed indirectly in vivo by monitoring the res-
onance of phosphate in ATP using 31P-MRS. Previous studies
using 31P-MRS have frequently, but not always [41], reported
a ~20–25% reduction in mitochondrial ATP synthesis rates in
the skeletal muscle of those with type 1 diabetes [9–11]. While
31P-MRS has the obvious advantage of capturing ATP kinetics
under intact physiological conditions, a drawback of this ap-
proach is the lack of mechanistic understanding underlying
the changes in mitochondrial function that may be observed.
Consistent with the work of Cree-Green et al [9] and others
[10, 11], we observed a ~20% reduction in mitochondrial
oxidative capacity in the muscles of those with type 1 diabetes
(Fig. 1a, Max), suggesting that our in vitro (permeabilised
muscle fibre method) assessment is consistent with 31P-MRS
studies. What was unanswered from the aforementioned
31P-MRS studies, however, was whether the mitochondria
are reduced in content and/or impaired, or whether nutrient
delivery is the cause of the resulting poor mitochondrial func-
tion in those with type 1 diabetes. Here we provide the mech-
anistic insight to answer these questions.
First, regarding whether the deficits observed in previous
31P-MRS studies were directly related to differences in mito-
chondrial content or impairments of mitochondrial quality, we
now offer invaluable insight using ultrastructural analysis.
Using TEM, we observed no difference in the amount, distri-
bution and size of mitochondria within the skeletal muscle of
those with type 1 diabetes compared with control individuals.
Within the mitochondria, we observed no differences in the
protein expression of the individual electron transport chain
protein subunits using western blot analysis (total OXPHOS
cocktail), further suggesting that mitochondrial content is not
reduced in young, physically active adults with type 1 diabetes
vs control individuals. In contrast, we did observe structural
abnormalities in mitochondria using electron tomography;
disorganised cristae and more abundant autophagic structures
were present in the muscles of individuals with type 1 diabetes
compared with control participants. In line with this, we also
observed a significant reduction in mitochondria viability in
permeabilised myofibres of those with type 1 diabetes, as
assessed by CRC [23].
Second, these findings suggest that nutrient delivery in the
muscles of young adults with type 1 diabetes is not likely
impaired. Histological/immunofluorescent examination of
skeletal muscle biopsies revealed that capillary density within
the vastus lateralis muscle was not different between those
with type 1 diabetes and those without. Furthermore, as in-
creases in prothrombotic factors have been reported in those
with type 1 diabetes [29], we investigated whether the capil-
laries present were occluded by platelet aggregates (thrombi)
and found that they were not. While we do not see visible
evidence for impaired blood flow in the present study, we
cannot rule out the possibility of a functional impairment
resulting in reduced blood flow and delivery of oxygen and
nutrients within the muscles of those with type 1 diabetes [42].
Collectively, these novel results provide evidence of direct
alterations in skeletal muscle mitochondria in those with type
1 diabetes. The underlying mechanism(s) for these mitochon-
drial alterations in type 1 diabetes may be revealed by the
1420

 mitochondrial bioenergetics investigations related to mito-
chondrial H2O2 emission in this study. To the best of our
knowledge, mitochondrial-derived ROS production has never
been examined in skeletal muscle of humans with type 1 dia-
betes. We observed a significant increase in mitochondrial
H2O2 emission potential at the level of Complex III, with no
significant differences owing to Complex I, intermembrane
(mG3PDH) or matrix (PDC) proteins. Work using isolated
mitochondria [43, 44], has demonstrated that Complex III
significantly contributes to ROS production in response to
fatty acid oxidation. While we did not assess this in the current
study, future work should be undertaken to discern differences
in the propensity for ROS production at Complex III in re-
sponse to glucose and lipid substrate availability in those with
type 1 diabetes. The tissue requirements for the comprehen-
sive assessment of mitochondrial phenotype prohibited addi-
tional assessment of major mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes
(e.g. glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase and super-
oxide dismutase) and markers of oxidative stress in the present
study. Nonetheless, it has been suggested that Complex
III-generated ROS serves as a signalling molecule, particular-
ly in the adaptive response to hypoxia (for review see [45]).
This latter point may be physiologically important when con-
sidering the peripheral vascular disease that is known to de-
velop in older adults with type 1 diabetes.
Perspectives
This investigation revealed that young, active people with
type 1 diabetes possess mitochondrial and muscle ultrastruc-
tural abnormalities that precede reductions in capillary con-
tent. While we have demonstrated site-specific alterations in
mitochondrial bioenergetics, further investigation is required
to identify the precise signalling pathway leading to these
changes. Though our observations of increased autophagic
remnants in muscles of those with type 1 diabetes were not
associated with increases in autophagic markers
(p-ULK1Ser555 and p62), it is possible that these signals had
already been transmitted and pathways initiated.
Alternatively, recent work [46] has suggested that p62 activity
is redox sensitive and may promote autophagy in the absence
of changes in content. Clearly, future work in this area will
help further elucidate this important observation.
It seems likely that the relationship between skeletal mus-
cle abnormalities and dysglycaemia in type 1 diabetes are
reciprocal, particularly given previous suggestions that exces-
sive glucose provision to mitochondria elevates ROS produc-
tion [47, 48]. Another possible mechanism may relate to pe-
ripheral insulin administration. Specifically, in people without
type 1 diabetes, large rises in blood glucose levels following a
glucose load are attenuated by delivering insulin to the liver
first via the portal circulation. However, in those with type 1
diabetes, peripheral insulin administration bypasses the
canonical ‘liver-first’ model and results in greater elevations
in circulating blood glucose [49]. The peripheral insulin ad-
ministration shifts a greater burden of the glycaemic load to
skeletal muscle, forcing it to accept a greater glycaemic load
then it otherwise would [1, 2], thereby increasing glycaemic
stress akin to that previously described [50] for cell types that
could not regulate cellular glucose entry. An important avenue
for future research is to investigate this altered relationship
between blood glucose levels, peripheral insulin injections
and the muscle abnormalities reported in the type 1 diabetes
population. Indeed, this relationship might be considered in
the context of potential cellular abnormalities in other relevant
tissues, such as liver and adipose tissue.
A major clinical concern in this study is that the
mitochondrial/metabolic alterations observed were in young
adults with type 1 diabetes, who had self-reported
moderate-to-vigorous activity levels above the American and
Canadian diabetes associations’ recommendations. In addi-
tion, these changes occurred in large, proximal muscle groups
without a detectable loss of capillary density. Clearly, larger
cohort studies are needed to assess the impact of type 1 dia-
betes in those who are sedentary, as well as those who meet or
exceed physical activity recommendations, to determine
whether an optimal level of physical activity exists that is
sufficient to restore/overcome the metabolic abnormalities
that characterise the muscle of those with type 1 diabetes.
