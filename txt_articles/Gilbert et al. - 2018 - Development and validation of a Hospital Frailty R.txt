Summary
Background Older people are increasing users of health care globally. We aimed to establish whether older people 
with characteristics of frailty and who are at risk of adverse health-care outcomes could be identified using routinely 
collected data.
Methods A three-step approach was used to develop and validate a Hospital Frailty Risk Score from International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes. First, 
we carried out a cluster analysis to identify a group of older people (≥75 years) admitted to hospital who had 
high resource use and diagnoses associated with frailty. Second, we created a Hospital Frailty Risk Score based on 
ICD-10 codes that characterised this group. Third, in separate cohorts, we tested how well the score predicted adverse 
outcomes and whether it identified similar groups as other frailty tools.
Findings In the development cohort (n=22 139), older people with frailty diagnoses formed a distinct group and had 
higher non-elective hospital use (33·6 bed-days over 2 years compared with 23·0 bed-days for the group with the next 
highest number of bed-days). In the national validation cohort (n=1 013 590), compared with the 429 762 (42·4%) patients 
with the lowest risk scores, the 202 718 (20·0%) patients with the highest Hospital Frailty Risk Scores had increased 
odds of 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1·71, 95% CI 1·68–1·75), long hospital stay (6·03, 5·92–6·10), and 30-day 
readmission (1·48, 1·46–1·50). The c statistics (ie, model discrimination) between individuals for these three 
outcomes were 0·60, 0·68, and 0·56, respectively. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score showed fair overlap with 
dichotomised Fried and Rockwood scales (kappa scores 0·22, 95% CI 0·15–0·30 and 0·30, 0·22–0·38, respectively) 
and moderate agreement with the Rockwood Frailty Index (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0·41, 95% CI 0·38–0·47).
Interpretation The Hospital Frailty Risk Score provides hospitals and health systems with a low-cost, systematic way 
to screen for frailty and identify a group of patients who are at greater risk of adverse outcomes and for whom a 
frailty-attuned approach might be useful.

Introduction
Older people (conventionally aged at least 65 years 
according to WHO) are major users of acute hospital 
care in developed countries,1,2 and increasingly in the 
devel 
oping world.3 In England, a fifth of hospital 
admissions in 2014–15 were among people aged 75 years 
and older, accounting for around 40% of all days spent in 
hospital.4 For some older people, hospital admission is 
associated with an increased risk of harm over and above 
the presenting clinical condition.5 Several attempts have 
been made to identify people at high risk of poor 
outcomes, many focusing on frailty.5,6 Frailty describes a 
decline in function across several organ systems, linked 
to ageing, but progressing at different rates in different 
people; it is characterised by increased risk of poor 
outcomes in individuals exposed to an apparently 
innocuous stressor.7
Since frailty is potentially a determinant of the way care 
resources are used, the assessment of frailty should 
also inform processes of planning service provision 
and resource allocation, but there are major barriers 
to identification of frail older people. First, although 
many tools are available to measure frailty, commonly 
used measures show only moderate overlap in their 
identification of frailty8 and there is substantial variability 
in which tool is chosen and when it is used.9 Second, 
most tools are too complicated for use in acute care 
settings, and even shorter tools such as the Clinical 
Frailty Scale10 and Identification of Seniors at Risk11 tool 
require some form of manual assessment process, which 
can be time consuming and subject to inter-operator 
error. Finally, when frailty tools are used, they are applied 
for only a subset of patients, with most older people in 
hospital not having their frailty assessed at all.

We aimed to establish whether a Hospital Frailty Risk 
Score could be developed using the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)12 coding system, which 
is implemented in administrative hospital data 
bases in 
many countries worldwide.
Methods
Study design
We used a three-step approach to develop and validate a 
Hospital Frailty Risk Score, based on ICD-10 codes. First, 
we undertook a cluster analysis to test whether a distinct 
group of older patients admitted to hospital with 
characteristics of frailty could be identified on the basis 
of their ICD-10 codes and resource use. Second, we 
created the Hospital Frailty Risk Score using ICD-10 codes 
that were over-represented in the group. Third, in 
two separate validation cohorts, we tested how well the 
Hospital Frailty Risk Score predicted adverse outcomes 
after an emergency admission, and whether it identified 
similar people as other clinical frailty tools.
We analysed the 2013–14 and 2014–15 Hospital Episode 
Statistics (HES) inpatient database, which contains 
information about all patients admitted to National 
Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England. HES data 
capture illnesses and related conditions, with each 
electronic record containing up to 20 diagnosis fields 
coded according to ICD-10.12 The diagnostic codes are 
entered by professional coders using information 
gathered retrospectively from medical records. A unique 
anonymised identifier can be used to link several 
electronic records (including emergency department and 
outpatient attendances) for the same patient, and to link 
records to Office for National Statistics mortality data.13
For the validation work, HES data were linked to a 
cohort of people who had been studied during an acute 
hospital admission in the East Midlands, UK, and who 
had been assessed for frailty using established scales. 
Records were linked by NHS Digital using deterministic 
linkage based on a hierarchy of patient identifiers (date 
of birth, postcode, sex, and NHS number); de-identified 
data were provided for the analysis.
Ethical approval was provided by Essex National 
Research Ethics Committee (East of England; reference 
15/EE/024).
Development cohort
We extracted a cohort of people aged 75 years and older 
who were discharged from hospital between April 1, 2013, 
and March 31, 2015. The cohort was restricted to elective, 
non-elective, and day case admissions to NHS hospitals, 
excluding mental health and community health pro-
viders. Since cluster analysis is a computationally inten-
sive process, we further restricted our analysis to an 
80% random sample of people living in Southampton, 
Leicester, or Nottingham, using the random selection 
function in SAS. These areas were chosen because they 
represent mixed urban and rural health and social care 
economies.
In cluster analyses, patients are grouped together 
based on their similarity to each other across several 
characteristics. Three sets of variables were used to 
create the clustering matrix: ICD-10 diagnoses, bed-days, 
and hospital costs. Diagnoses were based on the first 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Frailty is associated with adverse clinical outcomes (eg, delirium 
and functional decline) in older people admitted to hospital. We 
searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses describing 
acute hospital services in the Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews, Database of Reviews of Effectiveness, MEDLINE, and 
Embase from 2005 to Feb 28, 2017. Search terms included “acute 
care”, (“frail elderly” OR “frail”), “geriatric assessment”, “health 
services for the aged”, “needs assessment”, and “risk assessment”. 
A systematic review showed that frailty or related risk scores 
focusing on older people can identify those at risk of adverse 
outcomes. Although most scales perform better than chance at 
predicting a range of poor outcomes, none has emerged as a 
globally recognised gold standard method for identifying risk of 
adverse events. Furthermore, frailty is not routinely captured in 
hospital coding systems, meaning frail older people remain 
anonymous at the system level (eg, to commissioners), 
in contrast to people with specific diseases such as stroke.
Added value of this study
The Hospital Frailty Risk Score developed and validated in this 
work performs at least as well as existing frailty or risk 
stratification tools and better than many. It has the 
advantage of being derived from International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 
Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, so can be used wherever 
ICD-10 coding systems are in place. A key advantage is 
that the score can be implemented into hospital information 
systems, removing the inter-operator variability and 
implementation burden associated with manual 
scoring systems.
Implications of all the available evidence
There are clear potential benefits to routinely identifying older 
people at risk of adverse clinical or service outcomes, or both, 
in acute hospital settings, primarily the ability to tailor 
frailty-attuned interventions from the point of arrival and 
throughout the hospital stay. Additional benefits include 
service mapping, commissioning, and assessment focusing on 
older people with frailty. A globally accepted method of 
identifying frail older people in acute hospital settings can 
help highlight the magnitude of the issue, enable services to 
evolve to provide frailty-attuned care, and improve patient 
and service outcomes.

three characters of all ICD-10 codes used in any of 
the 20 diagnostic fields of the patient’s records over a 
2-year period. Rare diagnoses (fewer than 15 000 patients 
nationally) were excluded. Bed-days were calculated as 
the total number of days in hospital for the same 
period. Costs were calculated using 2014–15 health-care 
resource group national tariffs and 2013–14 reference 
costs data.14
To create a similarity score that could be used to group 
patients, we used Gower’s method for combining binary 
(ICD-10 diagnoses) and continuous (bed-days and cost) 
variables.15 This method involved range standardisation to 
convert the continuous variables to a scale from 0 to 1. 
Patients were then assigned to clusters using Ward’s 
hierarchical clustering method.16 This is an agglomerative 
(ie, bottom-up) process in which each patient starts in his 
or her own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged step 
by step. The number of clusters was chosen pragmatically, 
to balance maximisation of the variance in similarity 
scores explained by the groups against production of 
the lowest number of clusters for clinically relevant 
interpretation.
To identify a cluster of patients with characteristics of 
frailty, we used a small set of ICD-10 codes identified a 
priori as being candidate markers of frailty (appendix). We 
also calculated the prevalence of coded frailty syndromes 
(cognitive impairment, functional dependence, falls and 
fractures, anxiety and depression, incontinence, pressure 
ulcers, and mobility problems) in each group, using a 
published model derived from ICD-10 codes.17 We also 
compared the admission history, the Charlson co-
morbidity index (a method of estimating risk of mortality 
from comorbid disease at a specified timepoint in 
longitudinal studies),18 and 2-year mortality in each group.
Risk stratification using a clustering method is 
computationally intensive and not easily replicable by 
individual hospitals, so we created an algorithm that 
could be more easily implemented, guided by the results 
of the cluster analysis. We derived a score based on 
ICD-10 codes that were at least twice as prevalent in the 
frail cluster as in the rest of the cohort. Points were 
awarded for each ICD-10 code that were proportional to 
how strongly they predicted membership of the cluster. 
Points were calculated using regression co 
efficients from 
a logistic regression model that included membership of 
the frail cluster as the binary dependent variable and the 
set of ICD-10 codes as binary predictor variables. Many of 
the ICD-10 codes were correlated with one another, so 
we included a penalty when fitting the model to shrink 
coefficients on individual predictor variables within 
correlated groups. We used a c statistic to assess how well 
this model discriminated between the frail cluster and 
the rest of the cohort. The resulting score is referred to 
as the Hospital Frailty Risk Score. Three categories, low 
risk, intermediate risk, and high risk, were created to aid 
interpretation, with cut-points selected pragmatically 
to create categories that dis 
criminated most strongly 
between individuals with diff
 erent outcomes (see later). 
Further details are given in the appendix.
Validation cohorts
In the first validation exercise, a national cohort was used 
to test how well the Hospital Frailty Risk Score predicted 
outcomes among people aged 75 years or older admitted 
to an acute hospital as an emergency between April 1, 2014, 
and March 31, 2015. We did a sensitivity analysis to 
ascertain whether including individuals also represented 
in the developmental cohort affected the results.
We fitted logistic regression models to estimate the 
associations of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score to three 
outcomes: 30-day mortality, long hospital stay (>10 days 
in hospital), and emergency readmission within 30 days 
of discharge (excluding patients who died in hospital). 
We estimated models with and without adjustment for 
the effects of patients’ age, sex, socioeconomic status, 
admission history, and Charlson comorbidity index19 as 
important predictors of these outcomes. Hospitals were 
included as random effects in the models to account for 
similarities in outcomes among patients treated in the 
same hospital compared with the whole population. 
Associations between the categories and each outcome 
are presented using odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% CIs. 
Model discrimination was summarised with a mean 
hospital-specific c statistic (appendix).
For the second validation exercise, we used a linked 
dataset on a local cohort of patients who had complete 
clinical frailty scale data and a linked HES record. These 
data were used to test agreement between frailty 
ratings based on our Hospital Frailty Risk Score 
and two prominent clinical measures of frailty: the 
Fried Phenotype and the Rockwood Frailty Index. The 
variables used to construct these two measures are 
described in the appendix. For the purpose of calculating

agreement, patients were classified as either frail or 
non-frail using each scale. The Fried model is based on 
five items, and for this study frailty was defined as 
having three or more items present.20 The Rockwood 
Frailty Index is based on a cumulative deficit of items, 
presented as a proportion of total items. For this study, a 
threshold of 0·25 was used to indicate frailty, because 
this has been proposed as a useful operational cut-
off.21 For our Hospital Frailty Risk Score, those in 
the intermediate-risk and high-risk categories were 
classified as frail. We assessed agreement using 
kappa coefficients with their 95% CIs. Additionally, 
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to describe 
the association between the continuous versions of the 
Hospital Frailty Risk Score and the Rockwood Frailty 
Index. Analyses were done in SAS version 9.4 and 
R version 3.3.0.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing 
of the report. TG, JN, JK, EK, and MB had full access to 
all the data in the study and all authors had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Among the 22 139 patients included in the development 
cohort, the mean age was 82·5 years (SD 5·6) and 
12 796 (57·8%) were female (table 1). 10 029 (45·3%) had 
one hospital admission. To characterise the different 
groups in this cohort, six clusters were selected. The 
characteristics of people in each of the clusters are 
summarised in table 2. Table 3 lists the ICD-10 codes that 
were over-represented in each of these clusters.
One of the six clusters was identified as likely 
to represent frailty based on the high proportion 
(4073 [83·0%] of 4907) of people with at least one frailty 
marker from the predefined list of ICD-10 codes 
(appendix), compared with 29·1% (5008 of 17 232) in the 
rest of the cohort. The proportion of people with at least 
one frailty syndrome17 documented was 4259 (86·8%) of 
4907 in the frailty cluster and 6048 (35·1%) of 17 232 in 
the remaining five clusters. The frail cluster made up a 
fifth of the cohort (4907 of 22 139), but were more likely 
to be admitted and have longer non-elective bed-days 
(table 2). 2350 (47·9%) of 4907 people in the frail cluster 
died over the 2 years, compared with 3952 (22·9%) of the 
remaining 17 232 in the cohort (table 2).
In the cluster analysis, 109 three-character ICD-10 
diagnostic codes were at least twice as prevalent in the 
frail cluster than in other clusters in the development 
cohort (table 3 shows the top 36). The list included 
measures of acuity relevant to the hospital context, 
such as acute infections, hospital-acquired problems, 
and cerebro 
vascular disease, as well as recognised frailty 
syndromes such as falls, fractures, and cognitive 
impairment. The model including these ICD-10 codes as 
predictors dis 
criminated strongly between patients in the 
frail versus other non-frail groups, with a c statistic 
of 0·94.
In the national validation cohort of 1 013 590 patients, 
629 440 (62·1%) had more than one previous admission

over the 2 years before their index emergency admission, 
and 406 450 (40·1%) had three or more previous 
admissions (table 1). In common with the development 
cohort, over half (581 801 [57·4%]) were women and the 
mean age was 84·1 years (SD 5·9).
Patients had Hospital Frailty Risk Scores ranging from 
0 to 99, but this was heavily skewed to the right: 
429 762 (42·4%) were categorised as low risk using a cut-
point score of less than 5, 381 110 (37·6%) as intermediate 
risk (5–15), and 202 718 (20·0%) as high risk (>15). The 
proportion of patients with poor outcomes increased 
with increasing values of the score, but the association 
with mortality flattened out above a score of 15 (figure 1). 
The association with having a long hospital stay reduced 
for the small group of patients with a score greater 
than 30.
Across the three categories of increasing frailty risk, 
the mean Charlson comorbidity index increased from 
1·9 (SD 2·1) to 4·5 (2·7) and the proportion with three or 
more past admissions increased from 63 938 (14·7%) 
of 434 952 to 100 621 (49·2%) of 204 514 (appendix). 
The number of people with at least one frailty syn-
drome increased from 99 604 (22·9%) of 434 952 to 
193 266 (94·5%) of 204 514, with the most striking 
gradient for cognitive impairment, increasing from 
20 443 (4·7%) of 434 952 to 135 388 (66·2%) of 204 514. 
The results of the analysis were not sensitive to the 
inclusion or exclusion of people included in the 
development cohort (appendix).
People with high frailty risk had a higher adjusted 
odds of 30-day mortality than those in the low-risk 
group (OR 1·71, 95% CI 1·68–1·75). They also had a 
higher adjusted odds of a long hospital stay (6·03, 
5·92–6·10) and of emergency readmission within 30 days 
(1·48, 1·46–1·50).
The Hospital Frailty Risk Score discriminated weakly 
between individuals with different outcomes within 
hospitals; the c statistics were 0·60 for 30-day mortality, 
0·68 for a long hospital stay, and 0·56 for 30-day 
readmission. The inclusion of patients’ other character-
istics (age, sex, deprivation, admission history, and 
comorbidity) improved discrimination to 0·69 for 30-day 
mortality, 0·73 for long hospital stay, and 0·61 for 
readmission.
In the second validation cohort, comprising 569 patients, 
the mean age was 79·9 years (SD 6·4), 317 (55·7%) were 
female, and 227 (39·9%) had a Hospital Frailty Risk Score 
above 5 (intermediate or high risk; table 1). The kappa 
score was 0·22 (95% CI 0·15–0·30) compared with 
a dichotomised version of Fried (≥3 items present) 
and 0·30 (0·22–0·38) compared with the Rockwood 
classification (using a cutoff of 0·25). There was a positive 
linear association between the Frailty Index and Hospital 
Frailty Risk Score (Pearson’s correlation co 
efficient 0·41, 
95% CI 0·38–0·47). The largest group for whom ratings 
differed were those with Hospital Frailty Risk Scores 
between 5 and 15 (figure 2), of whom only 40% were 
classified as frail by Rockwood.
Discussion
From an initial cluster analysis, we identified a group 
that, when compared with other older people, had a 
higher incidence of ICD-10 codes judged a priori to be 
indicative of frailty, as well as higher hospital use and 
associated resource use. A Hospital Frailty Risk Score 
was derived from a broad set of ICD-10 codes that were 
over-represented in this cluster, including measures of 
acuity. In a national validation cohort of more than a 
million patients, those with higher frailty risk had higher 
risk of 30-day mortality, prolonged stay in hospital, and 
30-day readmission. Although predictive at the group 
level, the ability of the score to discriminate between 
individuals with different outcomes was low. Using 
various thresholds to categorise patients as frail, the 
Hospital Frailty Risk Score showed fair to moder 
ate 
overlap with ratings based on Fried and Rockwood 
frailty scales.
The advantage of using administrative hospital data to 
identify frailty risk is that it can be calculated using 
routine data for all patients in hospital and removes the 
need to apply a manual score. Although scores such as 
the Clinical Frailty Scale can be quick and simple to 
calculate,22 they have inter-operator reliability issues and

risk (score 5–15), or high frailty risk (score >15).

impose a substantial implementation burden. A potential 
weakness of our score is that frailty among older people 
with few or no past admissions might be missed. 
Although these people are likely to be less frail than those 
with more or recent admissions,23 there will be exceptions, 
particularly in care home settings or areas with successful 
admissions avoidance schemes. In the national cohort 
used to test the score, two-thirds of patients had been 
admitted in the previous 2 years.
The value of using administrative data has previously 
been shown in primary care, with the development and 
dissemination of the Electronic Frailty Index, which is 
based on Read codes used in most UK general practices.24 
The use of ICD-10 codes routinely entered in administrative 
databases provides hospitals with a systematic method to 
screen for frailty risk. In the present study, rather than 
relying exclusively on a predefined list of ICD-10 codes to 
identify frailty, we identified a wider set of codes using well 
established cluster analysis methods.25 This approach 
allowed us to pick out the codes that are in routine use, 
rather than relying solely on opinion about which codes 
are most closely related to frailty.
Some diagnoses included in our score were associated 
with acute conditions such as aspiration pneumonia, 
delirium, and hospital-acquired or nosocomial infect-
ions. Arguably, these conditions could reflect frailty 
since these patients are likely to have swallowing 
problems, risk of dehydration, and be more vulnerable 
to hospital-acquired conditions and sepsis. However, 
our score can also identify other groups at risk of harm. 
A limitation of using ICD-10 is that the codes do not 
fully capture disease severity, and might also miss out 
important elements of frailty such as weakness, 
polypharmacy, and need for support in everyday living. 
Some of the ICD-10 Z codes reflect dependency or 
isolation, but these are typically only used when 
health-care delivery is adversely affected.
Another limitation of using ICD-10 is that variation in 
documentation and coding of diagnoses could contribute 
to measurement error.26 For example, routine diagnosis 
and documentation of conditions such as delirium vary 
between physicians, departments, and hospitals. To ex-
amine this variation, we explored the effect of hospital 
coding depth (mean number of secondary ICD-10 diagnoses 
coded) as a measure of coding quality.27 Among hospitals 
with better coding depth, a higher proportion of patients 
were classified as frail; nevertheless, the Hospital Frailty 
Risk Score was strongly predictive of poor outcomes even 
in hospitals with lower coding depths. In England, 
routinely collected data are sufficiently robust and accurate 
to be used in research or for health services planning,28 and 
the score guards against the problem of coding depth 
by the use of three-character rather than four-character 
ICD-10 codes.28 Nevertheless, coding accuracy will vary 
in other countries, and further validation work would 
need to be done in health-care systems wishing to test 
our approach.
Agreement between frailty ratings based on our 
Hospital Frailty Risk Score and other clinical frailty scales 
ranged between fair and moderate. This level of agree-
ment is not uncommon with frailty scales, with, for 
example, kappa coefficients comparing Fried to 
Rockwood ranging from 0·3 to 0·5, depending on the 
measurement approach.29 This range of scores shows 
the challenge in using any one frailty scale to diagnose 
an individual as frail.
Our score is comparable to tools specifically designed 
for risk stratification in emergency care settings, which 
also do not discriminate strongly, reflecting the fact that 
individual outcomes are inherently unpredictable in 
acute settings. For example, the Identification of Seniors 
at Risk tool11 predicted 6-month mortality and readmission 
with c statistics ranging from 0·54 to 0·65. Our score 
performed similarly or slightly better than models 
including ICD-10 coded frailty syndromes as predictors of 
30-day mortality and readmission.17 The c statistics ranged 
from 0·57 to 0·66 for models including frailty syndromes, 
age, sex, and admission history.
The appendix provides the ICD-10 codes and methods 
to derive the score and risk categories, which can be 
implemented by hospitals and public health teams to 
facilitate routine identification of frail cohorts who are at 
risk of poor clinical or service outcomes, or both, in acute 
hospital settings. In a hospital admitting 1000 older 
people per month, 200 would be classified as high risk 
and a further 400 as intermediate risk, among whom 
mortality would be expected to be double that of other 
older patients. Identifying this group of patients would 
enable targeted screening for frailty syndromes and the 
delivery of frailty-attuned approaches to care. Examples 
include the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment,30 
prevention of delirium31 and functional deterioration,32 
and identification of end-of-life care needs33 on a 
hospital-wide basis.34
Further research could examine how well the frailty 
risk score predicts outcomes other than mortality, the 
long-term relation with interventions, health and ser-
vice utilisation outcomes, and the relation with pri-
mary care frailty scores, such as the electronic Frailty 
Index.24 Additional studies might improve the acc 
uracy 
of the score by examining the role of additional vari-
 
ables, such as physiological parameters of disease 
severity.35 Additional work should explore the effect of 
the score on clinical decision making, in particular that 
it does not have the perverse effect of increasing 
therapeutic nihilism.36
