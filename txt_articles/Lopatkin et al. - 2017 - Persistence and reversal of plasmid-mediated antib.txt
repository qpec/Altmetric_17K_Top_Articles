In the absence of antibiotic-mediated selection, sensitive bacteria are expected to displace
their resistant counterparts if resistance genes are costly. However, many resistance genes
persist for long periods in the absence of antibiotics. Horizontal gene transfer (primarily
conjugation) could explain this persistence, but it has been suggested that very high con-
jugation rates would be required. Here, we show that common conjugal plasmids, even when
costly, are indeed transferred at sufficiently high rates to be maintained in the absence of
antibiotics in Escherichia coli. The notion is applicable to nine plasmids from six major
incompatibility groups and mixed populations carrying multiple plasmids. These results
suggest that reducing antibiotic use alone is likely insufficient for reversing resistance.
Therefore, combining conjugation inhibition and promoting plasmid loss would be an effec-
tive strategy to limit conjugation-assisted persistence of antibiotic resistance.

liminating antibiotic use is an appealing strategy to promote
resistance reversal, or the elimination of resistant bacteria by
displacing
them
with
their
sensitive
counterparts1–3
(Fig. 1a). Indeed, resistance genes often carry a fitness cost, giving
the sensitive strains a growth advantage4–6. In the absence of
selection for antibiotic resistance, competition between the two
populations would presumably eliminate the resistant strain over
time5, 7. However, despite its conceptual simplicity, this approach
has been largely unsuccessful8–10. Several factors can enable the
persistence of resistance in the absence of selection. For instance,
co-selection
could
propagate
genetically
linked
resistance
genes11, 12. Also, compensatory evolution ameliorating fitness
cost can reduce plasmid burden4, 13, 14.
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of plasmids, primarily through
conjugation, has also been proposed as a mechanism for plasmid
persistence6, 10, 15. Theoretical analysis suggests that a sufficiently
fast transfer rate can compensate for fitness cost and plasmid
loss16–18, although the extent to which conjugation-mediated
maintenance of costly plasmids occurs in nature has been deba-
ted16, 17, 19–22. For example, it has been suggested that transfer
efficiencies required to overcome reasonable estimates of fitness
cost and plasmid loss are too high to be biologically realistic19–22.
Also, the persistence of purely parasitic genetic elements is evo-
lutionarily paradoxical. Overall, conjugation alone is usually not
considered to be a dominant mechanism for maintaining plas-
mids23–25, although this is not always the case26, 27.
The fate of a plasmid is largely driven by the relative magnitude of
its fitness cost and segregation error rate compared with that of its
conjugation efficiency. Indeed, studies investigating conjugal plas-
mid dynamics in the absence of selection attribute plasmid persis-
tence to fast conjugation rate, low/no fitness cost, or both22, 28–31.
Similarly, plasmid elimination is attributed to slow conjugation
and/or high growth burden22, 32, 33. Different outcomes likely
depend on underlying parameter differences between experi-
mental systems due to different plasmids, conjugation machinery,
and mating procedures, among others.
Accurate quantification of all three processes should provide a
general framework to reconcile diverse outcomes and establish
the role of conjugation in promoting plasmid persistence. How-
ever, confounding measurements of conjugation and growth
dynamics have prevented general conclusions34, 35. For instance,
a high segregation error rate could be obscured by a fast con-
jugation efficiency36. Also, parameters depend on a range of
variables including the host strain37 and growth conditions32,
which complicates data interpretation.
Past studies did not provide precise estimates for all three
processes. In some cases, this is because reasonable parameter
estimates from available data appear sufficient22, which is
appropriate so long as the estimates are obtained from a relevant
experimental framework. In others, experimental complexities
prevent accurate quantification within the relevant context
(e.g., in vitro growth estimates to evaluate bacterial dynamics in
the mouse gut)29, 32. Even when all parameters are measured,
confounding factors were often not accounted for in the data
interpretation. For example, in some cases quantification of the
conjugation efficiency was carried out without eliminating the
contribution from selection dynamics32, 33. As a result, the extent
to which conjugation contributes to plasmid maintenance
remains inconclusive6, 23–25, 38, 39.
Lack of basic understanding is prohibitive when evaluating the
generality of plasmid fate, such as in natural microbial commu-
nities. Typically, microbial consortia consist of multiple inter-
acting populations, connected through a complex network of
HGT6, 40. High transfer rates in relevant environments (e.g., the
gut) have implications in forming communal gene pools where
local bacteria can share a wide range (and continuously growing

 pot) of beneficial traits26. Disrupting such networks has been
recognized as a potential intervention strategy to restore anti-
biotic susceptibility41.
Here, we show that common conjugal plasmids covering major
incompatibility groups and a range of fitness burdens can be
maintained via conjugation, and a simple stability criterion pre-
dicts this plasmid persistence. This is true for microbial com-
munities of increasing complexity (e.g., multiple plasmids/
strains). Using this framework, we show that reversal or sup-
pression of conjugation-mediated resistance spread is possible by
targeting parameters critical for plasmid maintenance.
Results
A criterion for plasmid maintenance via conjugation. We used
a simple kinetic model to investigate the extent to which HGT
contributes to plasmid maintenance. The model describes one
population (S) that either carries the plasmid (S1) or is plasmid
free (S0) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Eqs.
(3)–(4)). In particular, we determined the conditions where the
plasmid-carrying population is dominant to provide a con-
servative estimate for a critical conjugation efficiency. For the
limiting case where the rate of plasmid loss is relatively small (see
Supplementary Methods, “Deriving a stability criterion”), we
derived
a
critical
conjugation
efficiency
(ηCrit,
Eq.
(1)),
which approximates an upper bound for dominant plasmid
persistance:
ηCrit ¼ α κ þ D
ð
Þ � D;
ð1Þ
where α indicates the relative cost (α > 1) or the benefit (α < 1) of
the plasmid, κ is the rate constant of plasmid loss, and D is the
dilution rate of the two populations. Thus, we use the term
“species” to differentiate between any two populations with a
uniquely defined ηCrit, which minimally requires different bac-
terial clones with genetically distinct backgrounds (e.g., strains or
taxonomically diverse species).
According to Eq. (1), a plasmid will be maintained as long as
the conjugation efficiency is sufficiently fast compared with the
rate of plasmid loss and fitness burden (Fig. 1c, d). Sufficiently
fast conjugation efficiency is necessary for the plasmid-carrying
population to be dominant (S1 > S0, Fig. 1c), even when a plasmid
is slightly beneficial (α is slightly <1). Our criterion is similar to
that derived by Stewart and Levin17, but is more stringent in that

the control of strong constitutive promoter PR44. When B carries K, it is denoted BK. K without transferability (i.e., without oriT) is denoted K−, and when

 it further requires dominance of the plasmid-carrying popula-
tion. It also avoids experimental challenges associated with
decoupling plasmid loss measurements from fitness cost42.
Experimentally, observed plasmid loss (κobs) can be determined
by measuring the time constant of decay for a non-transferrable
plasmid, which represents a combined effect of true κ and α
(Supplementary Fig. 1A)43. Indeed, analysis shows that κobs � κ
for plasmids with minimal fitness effects (α ≈ 1). Since these two
parameters are challenging to decouple, our criterion lumps the
effects of α and κ together. To determine κobs, we chose to use a
low-cost plasmid (α = 1.02) to minimize the confounding effects
of cost. Based on our experimentally determined parameters,
analysis shows the standard error associated with fitting the
plasmid loss rate (≈ 0.0022) is greater than the difference between
κobs and κ (see Supplementary Methods, “Plasmid loss calcula-
tions”, for complete derivation).
Conjugation-assisted persistence in a synthetic system. To test
whether the conjugation efficiency for common conjugal plas-
mids is sufficiently fast to compensate for cost, we first adopted a
synthetic conjugation system derived from the F plasmid. In this
system, the conjugation machinery is encoded on a helper plas-
mid FHR, which is not self-transmissible44. A second plasmid can
be mobilized through conjugation when it carries the F origin of
transfer sequence oriT. Here, we use a mobilizable plasmid
denoted K, which expresses YFP under the control of the strong
constitutive
promoter
PR,
a
kanamycin
(Kan)
resistance
gene (kanR)44, and oriT. To quantify the effects of conjugation,
we implemented a plasmid identical to K except that it does not
carry oriT (K−), and therefore cannot be transferred by con-
jugation. The synthetic system was introduced into an engineered
derivative of Escherichia coli MG1655 expressing a constitutive
blue fluorescent protein (BFP) chromosomally and carbenicillin
(Carb) resistance (AmpR)45, denoted B (Fig. 2a). The plasmid-
carrying populations (BK, BK−) can be distinguished from the
plasmid-free population (B0) by selective plating (using Carb
+Kan) or flow cytometry (using YFP) (Supplementary Fig. 2A).
This notation will be used to describe all species and plasmid
combinations throughout the text (see Supplementary Methods,
“Nomenclature”).
This system provides a clean experimental configuration to
elucidate the contribution of conjugation to plasmid mainte-
nance. K enables more precise parameter estimates compared to
natural self-transmissible plasmids. Native plasmids often encode
additional functions that complicate measurements, such as
addiction modules that can result in post-segregational killing of
daughter
cells46.
Importantly,
without
a
non-transmissible
control plasmid, it is difficult to decouple the effects of HGT
from other processes. Instead, plasmid loss and fitness burden can
be precisely quantified using K−, which eliminates the confound-
ing influence of conjugation. Since oriT did not significantly affect
the burden of K compared to K− (Supplementary Fig. 1B, P > 0.5,
two-sided t-test), differences that arise in the overall dynamics
can be attributed to conjugation.
From our measurements of K, we expect conjugation to be fast
enough to enable maintenance in the absence of antibiotic selec-
tion. In particular, our measurements of κ = 0.001 h−1 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1A), α = 1.02 (Supplementary Fig. 1C), and
assuming D ≈ 0.05 h−1, we estimate the critical efficiency ηCrit ¼
0:002 h−1 to be well below the estimate of conjugation efficiency
from exponential phase growth ηC � 0:01 h−134 (see Methods,
“Estimating ηCrit”). Indeed, cell physiology can drastically change
the conjugation efficiency34, as this value is almost four orders of
magnitude greater than the efficiency measured from cells
harvested from stationary phase (Supplementary Table 3).
To test conjugation-mediated plasmid maintenance, we mixed
BK and B0 in equal fractions and cultured them together. A strong
dilution (10,000×) was performed every 24 h to maintain growth.
Different concentrations of Kan (0, 0.5, and 2 μg/mL) were used
to vary α (1.02, 0.97, 0.42, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 1C).
Every few days, we quantified the fractions of plasmid-bearing
cells (expressing BFP and YFP) and plasmid-free cells (expressing
BFP only) using flow cytometry (see Supplementary Fig. 2A and
Methods section “Flow cytometry calibration” for calibration
details).
In the absence of conjugation, when the plasmid carries a cost
(e.g., Kan = 0 and α > 1) the plasmid-bearing population was
eliminated after 2 weeks (Fig. 2b, left modeling and right
experiment). Thus, for a non-transferrable costly plasmid,
eliminating antibiotics results in resistance reversal. If the plasmid
was sufficiently beneficial, the plasmid-bearing population could
coexist with the plasmid-free population (Fig. 2b, left modeling
and right experiment). The fraction of plasmid-bearing cells
depended on the relative magnitude of growth advantage
compared with plasmid loss. In contrast, if the plasmid is
transferrable through conjugation, even when the plasmid carries
a cost, plasmid-bearing cells dominate the population in a short
period of time (Fig. 2c, left modeling and right experiment).
Intuitively, decreasing cost or increasing benefit (i.e., decreasing
α) facilitates conjugation-assisted persistence, and therefore
plasmid stability occurs on a faster timescale (Fig. 2c). Once the
plasmid benefit is sufficiently high (Fig. 2c), the plasmid persists
regardless of whether or not it can conjugate, indicating that
conjugation is no longer required to maintain resistance.
Further, analysis suggests compensatory mutations, even at a
high mutation rate, did not contribute significantly to the overall
dynamics (Supplementary Fig. 2B). We note that our model
assumes a constant dilution rate constant (D), which represents
an approximation of the discrete, periodic dilutions in our
experiments. Simulations using a model implementing discrete
dilutions generated qualitatively the same results (Supplementary
Fig. 1D). Finally, we introduced noise in the conjugation rate for
each set of initial conditions such that ηC can vary a small amount
from the basal value, within 10% of the mean, consistent with
clonal
variability34.
This
variability
does
not
change
the
qualitative results (Supplementary Fig. 2C).
Conjugation-assisted persistence for diverse plasmids. We
previously demonstrated that the conjugation efficiency of the
synthetic system is comparable to that of natural F plasmids and
several other natural conjugation plasmids34. Therefore, we
expect these plasmids to also exhibit conjugation-assisted per-
sistence. To this end, we quantified the dynamics of eight addi-
tional conjugative plasmids, covering six incompatibility groups
(incF, incN, incI, incX, incW, and incP) which encompass >70%
of the most common large plasmids isolated from Enterobacter-
iacea (335 plasmids that are >20 kB from GenBank)47, cover a
wide range of conjugation efficiencies and fitness effects (Sup-
plementary Fig. 3A, B), and include three clinically isolated
conjugative plasmids encoding extended-spectrum β-lactamases
(ESBLs). ESBL-producing pathogens are notorious for plasmid-
mediated conjugation48–50 and are of paramount global health
concern51, 52. We transferred each individual plasmid into a
common background strain (E. coli MG1655 with chromosomally
integrated
dTomato, and
chloramphenicol
(Cm)
resistance
(CmR), denoted R), and quantified the relevant parameters to
estimate ηCrit; the plasmid C was quantified with background
strain B since both plasmid C and strain R express CmR, and B
behaves qualitatively similarly to R (Supplementary Fig. 3D).

Þ for each of the nine plasmids (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3C, including RK for control), either because they are
sufficiently beneficial and/or transferred fast enough. To test this,
we implemented the same competition experiments as previously
described, and quantified the fraction of plasmid-bearing cells
using colony-forming units (CFU) on double-antibiotic plates
(see Methods). Daily dilutions were performed for 14–20 days.
Indeed, each plasmid persisted throughout the duration of the
experiment (Fig. 2d). The maintenance or dominance of several
plasmids (#168, #193, RP4, R6K, and R388) was likely due to
them being neutral or slight beneficial (Supplementary Fig. 3C),
in addition to their fast transfer. In contrast, PCU1 was
maintained despite its very high cost (estimated α ≈ 3, Fig. 2d;
see Supplementary Fig. 3E for logscale).
Conjugation-assisted persistence in greater complexity con-
sortia. Natural environments are typically far more complex,
consisting of diverse species interconnected through an intricate
web of gene exchange6, 53. Such networks can serve as reservoirs
for antibiotic resistance in so-called HGT “hot spots”, enabling
the dissemination of resistance to various pathogens or com-
mensal
microbes54–56.
Therefore,
we
wondered
whether
conjugation-assisted persistence could occur in a multi-species
community. This question was never conclusively explored
previously.
Modeling suggests that, as long as the stability criterion is met,
a single plasmid can be maintained via conjugation regardless of
the number of species present (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Methods,
Supplementary Eqs. (7)–(10)). To test this, we introduced a
second E. coli strain R with or without oriT (RK or RK−)
(Supplementary Fig. 4A). The total plasmid content is quantified
as the sum of all plasmid-bearing species (RK+BK). Consistent
with our predictions, results demonstrate that conjugation
enables plasmid persistence compared to the non-conjugating
control (Fig. 3a).
Moreover, modeling predicts conjugation-assisted persistence
to occur for a single species carrying multiple conjugation

 plasmids. This is contingent on the plasmids’ ability to exist
independently of each other (e.g., distinct incompatibility groups
to ensure compatible replication machinery and the absence of
surface exclusion that prevents entry of one of the plasmids), and
the fact that other relevant plasmid parameters (i.e., ηC, α, or κ)
are not drastically altered by the presence of another plasmid
(Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Eqs. (11)–(14)). To test
this idea, we implemented a bi-directionally conjugating popula-
tion by mixing B carrying either K or another mobilizable
plasmid C. C expresses mCherry, CmR, and is compatible with K
(p15A and pSC101 replication origins, respectively). Indepen-
dently, since C has a greater cost compared to K (Supplementary
Fig. 3B), conjugation required a longer time-scale to overcome
competition and stably persist (Fig. 3b). Together, the dynamics
of each plasmid individually were identical to that of the single-
plasmid population dynamics, regardless of how we modulated α
(Fig. 3c, no antibiotic, Kan, and Cm; see Supplementary Fig. 4A, B
for α estimates).
These results suggest that, despite the apparent complexity,
plasmid fate in a community consisting of multiple (n) species
and (p) plasmids (leading to n2p populations) can be inferred
from the individual plasmid dynamics, if these plasmids do not
interfere with each other. The fate of each plasmid is governed by
the criterion for conjugation-assisted persistence (e.g., ηC>ηCrit).
If ηC>ηCrit for at least one such pair, the plasmid will persist if the
particular host(s) can coexist within the population long term
(which is largely driven by fitness). Importantly, the coexisting
species must acquire the plasmid, either in the initial population
structure, or via conjugation. This results in an initial barrier for
the plasmid to establish itself due to competition, resulting in a
dependence on the initial composition in determining plasmid
fate (see Supplementary Methods, “Three-species three-plasmids
model”).
To test this, we constructed a community consisting of three
species (E. coli strains denoted B0, R0, and Y0) transferring three
mutually compatible plasmids (Supplementary Fig. 5A, Supple-
mentary Methods, Supplementary Eq. (16), Supplementary
Table 4). Each plasmid was initiated in a single species,
respectively (RP4, R6K, and R388, denoted 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 3d,
Supplementary Fig. 5A). These three plasmids were chosen in
particular since they belong to distinct incompatibility groups (X,
P, and W), and are distinguishable using antibiotic selection

insufficient, Lin with Pheno synergistically destabilized the plasmid. e Combination treatment with Lin and Pheno suppressed or reversed resistance. The

measurements were done in replicates of four-to-six plates, and repeated at least twice for reproducibility. All flow measurements were propagated with at
least eight well replicates and repeated at least twice for reproducibility. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the plate or well replicates

 exhibited persistence throughout the duration of the experiment,
for up to 2 weeks (Fig. 3e). In the absence of conjugation (R0, B0,
and Y0 only), competition between the three species favors the
fittest population (Y0), suppressing the growth of both R0 and B0
(Supplementary Fig. 5B).
Reversing conjugation-assisted persistence of resistance. Our
results demonstrate that diverse conjugal plasmids are indeed
transferred fast enough to enable plasmid persistence. According
to the existence criterion (Eq. (1)), however, resistance reversal
can be achieved by inhibiting conjugation, promoting the rate of
plasmid loss, or both (Fig. 4a). The efficacy of this strategy
depends on how much ηC exceeds ηCrit. If ηC is only slightly
greater than ηCrit, inhibiting conjugation alone might be sufficient
to reverse resistance. If inhibition alone is incomplete, however,
promoting κ may act in synergy to destabilize the plasmid.
We first tested this inhibition strategy on the engineered
conjugation system by using linoleic acid57 (Lin) to inhibit
conjugation (Fig. 4b, left panel) and phenothiazine (Pheno) to
enhance the plasmid segregation error58, 59 (Fig. 4b, right panel).
Both compounds had been identified in literature for these
specific properties. Importantly, at the concentrations we used,
neither compound affected the bacterial growth rate (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6A). Indeed, Lin alone was sufficient to destabilize a
plasmid with low conjugation efficiency (Fig. 4c, plasmid K). For
a plasmid with greater ηC (e.g., for plasmid #41) or conferred a
benefit, Lin alone was insufficient, and the synergistic combina-
tion of Lin with Pheno was critical to reverse resistance (Fig. 4d).
We note that Pheno alone did not affect the conjugation
efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 6B).
We found that Lin reduced the conjugation efficiency for most
of the native plasmids by three-fold (Supplementary Fig. 6C) and
even by 50-fold in one (see Supplementary Table 3 for all fold
changes). Adjusting for this decrease in predicted ηCrit, main-
taining the same cost (Supplementary Fig. 6D), and assuming a
four-fold increase in the Pheno-enhanced plasmid loss rate
(Supplementary Fig. 6B, right), our criterion predicts that
conjugation-assisted persistence would be significantly reduced
for most plasmids (Supplementary Fig. 6E, Supplementary
Table 3). Indeed, a combination of Lin and Pheno led to >99%
elimination of plasmids where Δn < 0 (Fig. 4e, plasmids K, #41,
#168, PCU1, Supplementary Fig. 6F for log-scale PCU1 as
comparison to Supplementary Fig. 3E). If Δn is close to but
slightly greater than 0, the plasmid still persisted but with a
reduced infectivity (Fig. 4e plasmids C, #193). If Δn is sufficiently
large (>>0), the plasmid was maintained (Fig. 4e plasmids RP4,
R6K, R388). However, they were less dominant in comparison
with the absence of Lin and Pheno (Fig. 2d), indicating the role of
conjugation in their maintenance. That these three plasmids were
more difficult to reverse is not surprising, since they carry a small
burden or even a benefit, to R (Supplementary Fig. 3B).
Discussion
It is estimated that >50% of all plasmids can be transferred by
conjugation25. The extent to which conjugation contributes to the
difficulty to reverse antibiotic resistance has been debated for
decades16, 38, 60. Some have suggested that conjugation is not a
major mechanism responsible for the persistence of plasmids20,
23, 39, 61. We believe that the root of this apparent confusion is the
lack of precise quantification of the plasmid dynamics as affected
by conjugation, under environments with varying degrees of
selection. Moreover, how conjugation contributes to plasmid
persistence in a generic multi-species community has not been
previously investigated.
Our results demonstrate that the transfer of various conjugal
plasmids is sufficiently fast to exhibit persistence. This is con-
sistent with recent work demonstrating the persistence of heavy
metal resistance in the absence of positive selection when trans-
ferrable via conjugation, compared to inheritable solely through
clonal expansion (the latter of which required positive selection to
maintain)62. The plasmids tested here cover six of the major
incompatibility groups. Many plasmids encoding ESBL genes
spread to diverse species through conjugation48, 63. Our findings
may shed light on the apparent paradox regarding the high
prevalence of ESBL resistance, despite studies having determined
ESBL plasmids are often costly to maintain33, 64, 65. Indeed, even
in the absence of β-lactam treatment, our findings suggest that
ESBL resistance is likely to persist for long periods of time. We
further demonstrated that conjugation-assisted persistence is
generally applicable to communities containing multiple plasmids
and multiple populations each defined by a unique critical con-
jugation efficiency. This is particularly relevant, since HGT is
pervasive, and extensively occurs in hot spots associated with
highly dense and complex population structures, such as in the
gut microbiome54. That independent plasmid dynamics are
additive
greatly
simplifies
our
understanding
of
plasmid
dynamics in populations with greater complexity, as well as future
work investigating intervention strategies.
Several other factors may contribute to the long-term stability
of such plasmids in the environment. Indeed, almost half of all
plasmids are unable to transfer via conjugation. Co-evolution
between the host and plasmid can compensate for fitness
cost13, 14, 24, 66, 67, and recent work has shown that other factors
such as positive selection coupled with compensatory adaptation
can help explain long-term plasmid persistence24, 68. Interest-
ingly, compensatory mutations may also modulate other key
processes involved with mobile genetic element (MGE) upkeep by
directly or indirectly modulating processes involved in conjuga-
tion, such as decreased expression of MGE replication67, down
regulation of global gene expression69, or increased plasmid copy
number68. Indeed, recent theoretical work emphasized the
potentially paradoxical role of these interacting processes, where
reducing fitness cost could mitigate the evolution for higher
conjugation rates70. Future work investigating the extent to which
compensatory mutations individually modulate α, κ, ηC, or some
combination thereof, would provide critical insight into predict-
ing evolutionary trajectories that enhance plasmid stability.
Population dynamics are another potential contributing factor;
one study showed that the presence of alternative hosts can
promote the survival of a plasmid unable to persist in mono-
culture71. The physical environment may play an important role
in plasmid persistence as well, since HGT dynamics change
depending on the spatial structure of the community (reviewed in
ref. 6).
Our findings demonstrate the necessity to inhibit the con-
jugation process for effective resistance reversal. In particular, in
the absence of active intervention strategies, it is likely that
judicious antibiotic use may only suspend the process of con-
tinued selection and enrichment, but would be unable to reverse
resistance due to conjugation72, 73. To this end, the synergy
between plasmid-curing compounds and conjugation inhibitors
represents a novel approach for antibiotic adjuvants aimed at
targeting the ecological and evolutionary aspects of bacterial
pathogenesis3, 41.

 helper F plasmid FHR, express BFP and ampicillin (Amp, or Carb for carbenicillin)
resistance (AmpR), or dTomato and CmR, respectively. Note that for the multi-
plasmid multi-species experiment, B0 expresses CmR instead of AmpR (see Sup-
plementary Table 1 for a complete list of strain details). Donor cells (B0 or R0
background) contain mobilization plasmid K from Dimitriu et al. (denoted Y in
referenced publication)44, which carries yfp gene under the control of strong
constitutive PR promoter, oriT for transfer, and expresses kanamycin (Kan)
resistance (KanR) (denoted BK). For conjugation controls, non-transferrable plas-
mid K− is used, which is identical to K but without oriT. Upon conjugation,
transconjugants become indistinguishable from the donors. For experiments with a
more costly plasmid (Fig. 3b), plasmid C is used. C expresses CmR, mCherry, and
has p15A replication origin. For a complete list of strains and plasmids used in this
study, see Supplementary Table 1. For all experiments, single clones were grown
separately overnight at 37 °C for 16 h with shaking (250 rpm) in Luria-Bertani (LB)
broth containing appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/mL Cm, 100 μg/mL Carb, or 50
μg/mL Kan). All experiments were performed using M9 medium (M9CA medium
broth powder from Amresco, lot #2055C146, containing 2 mg/mL casamino acid,
supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL thiamine, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 0.4%
w/v glucose).
Long-term plasmid dynamics for engineered conjugation. 16h overnight cul-
tures (3 mL LB media with appropriate selecting agents, density ~1 × 109 CFU/mL)
were resuspended in M9 medium and diluted to an initial starting density of ~80
cells/well. Strong initial dilutions were used to generate replicates with a range of
initial conditions per well. Depending on the experiment, replicates ranged from 12
to 48 wells. For the one-species one-plasmid conjugation experiment (Fig. 2c), B0
and BK cells were mixed in an equal ratio and strongly diluted to an initial density
of ~80 cells/well combined. The strongly diluted cell mixture was distributed
among 24-well replicates in a 96-well plate to a final volume of 200 μL/well, sup-
plemented with appropriate antibiotic (Kan = 0, 0.5, or 2 μg/mL). 96-well plates
were covered with an AeraSealTM film sealant (Sigma-Aldrich, SKU A9224) fol-
lowed by a Breath-Easy sealing membrane (Sigma-Aldrich, SKU Z380059). Plates
were shaken at 250 rpm for 23 h and 37 °C. This is denoted Day 0.
To passage the plates, 198 μL/well of freshly mixed media was distributed into a
new 96-well plate, and an intermediate passaging plate containing 198 μL/well of
autoclaved diH2O was prepared. 2 μL from the previous day’s plate was transferred
to the intermediate passaging plate, mixed by pipet, and then 2 μL from the
intermediate passaging plate was transferred into the new media-containing plate
to achieve daily dilutions of 10,000×. The new plate was sealed using both
membranes, and placed back into the incubator to shake. This process takes
approximately 1 h. An additional 2 μL of cells was added to the intermediate plate
to be used for flow cytometry, and the experiments were carried out typically for
14–18 days.
The same protocol is used for the one-plasmid two-species experiment (Fig. 3a,
48-well replicates), testing the additional, more costly, plasmid C (Fig. 3b, 12-well
replicates), and the two-plasmid one-species experiment (Fig. 3c, 12-well
replicates). All experiments are initiated with equal volumes of all populations,
except the latter, which initiates with only the two populations carrying each
plasmid (BK and BC). The initial starting density was maintained at ~80 cells/well
for each of these three experiments as well. Non-conjugating experiments had an
identical setup with the substitution of K− plasmid for K.
Flow cytometry calibration. To calibrate flow cytometry for accurate quantifica-
tion of plasmid-free and plasmid-carrying populations we mixed various ratios of
the cell populations B0, R0, BK−, and RK− in different combinations with one
another (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Volume ratios were used as a proxy for cell ratios
since differences in overnight CFU for all populations was statistically indis-
tinguishable (P > 0.5, two-sided t-test). Cell mixtures were calibrated at high (400×)
and low (1000×) dilution-fold from overnight culture, resulting in a flow speed of
between 3000–6000 cells/s. Fluorescent gating cutoffs were determined in such a
way that were both obvious by eye, and resulted in <5% differences between the
population mixtures (as determined by volume) when quantified. 5% was chosen as
this is the detection limit for the machine. All data quantification was performed
using MATLAB. The same threshold values were used to gate every experiment.
Flow measurements were always performed on live cells, in diH2O, on the actual
day of the experimental time point, within 1 h of removing the plate from the
incubator.
Quantifying modeling parameters α, η, κ. α was determined using plate-reader
measurements of B and R growth in the presence of 0, 0.5, or 2 μg/mL Kan using
the Perkin-Elmer Victor ×3. Overnight cultures of cells (prepared as described
previously) were resuspended into M9 media and diluted 10,000× prior to starting
the experiment. Four technical replicates per concentration were used for quan-
tification. Growth rates were quantified by log-transforming the growth curves,
using K-means clustering to non-arbitrarily locate the region of longest exponential
growth, smoothing, and fitting the linear portion (all processing done using
MATLAB). α is determined by normalizing the growth rate obtained from the
plasmid-free population (R0 or B0) by the plasmid-carrying population (RK or BK).
These experiments were performed at three antibiotic concentrations used in the
main experiments to accurately model the individual dynamics (Supplementary
Figs. 1C, 4A, B). The growth temperature used to quantify α corresponds to that
which was used for long-term experiments (e.g., 37 °C for R/RK, and 30 °C for R/
RRP4, see Supplementary Table 1 for each specific condition).
Conjugation efficiency was estimated using the protocol established by Lopatkin
et al34. 16 h overnight cultures of BK and R0 (3 mL LB media with appropriate
selecting agents, density ~1 × 109 CFU/mL) were resuspended in M9 medium
(0.4% w/v glucose) and mixed in a 1:1 ratio using 400 μL. Mixtures were incubated
at room temperature (25 °C) for 1 h in the absence of shaking. R0 and BK are used
pairwise in these experiments to take advantage of the different resistant markers:
Kan (50 μg/mL) is used to quantify donors, Cm (100 μg/mL) for recipients, and the
Kan+Cm combination can distinguish transconjugants. Parental densities were
obtained by serially diluting the mixture to net 5 × 107-fold, and spreading four-to-
six replicate measurements onto respective single-antibiotic-containing plates. To
quantify transconjugants (RK, as a result of transfer from B to R), cells were plated
at a dilution of 40-fold onto plates containing both antibiotics. Plates were
incubated overnight at 37 °C and CFUs were counted the following day.
The conjugation efficiency is estimated as η ¼
RK
BKR0Δt, with units of cell mL−1 h−1,
and is dependent on the cell density. For all modeling and plasmid persistence
predictions, we use the cell density-independent rate constant ηC, by normalizing η
with respect to the carrying capacity. That is, we let ηC ¼ ηNm, where Nm ¼ 109
cell/mL (the carrying capacity). ηC has units of h−1.
To estimate the plasmid loss rate, experiments were initiated with 100% of BK−,
the non-transferrable variant of K. Cells were diluted 10,000× daily and monitored
for approximately 1 week, at which point sufficient plasmid loss was observed
(Supplementary Fig. 1A) such that exponential functions could be fit to the loss
curves. The percentage BK− (BK− with no antibiotics normalized by BK− with 50 μg/
mL Kan) is fit to an exponential decay curve such that
%BK
0
%BK
Kan ¼ x1e�x2t, where the
calculated plasmid loss rate constant for plasmid K is κK ¼ x2
24 h−1. Similarly, the
same procedure is performed to determine the effect of Pheno on κK, where %BK−
treated with Pheno is used instead of %BK− without any treatment, e.g.:
%BK
Pheno
%BK
Kan ¼ x1e�x2t.
Conjugation dynamics for native plasmids. For all plasmids tested, those pre-
viously characterized were measured using known resistance markers from lit-
erature (e.g., R388, R6K, RP4, PCU1, K, and C). ESBL pathogen conjugation ability
and resistance spectrum was established in a previous publication34. In particular,
Carb resistance was transferred from conjugation-capable ESBL donors to R0
recipient for further characterization. R carrying one of the nine tested plasmids is
denoted RP for generality in this description (Supplementary Table 1). Incom-
patibility groups are determined via MLST courtesy of the Anderson group75. Some
ESBLs indicate multiple MLST identification, suggesting either fused incompat-
ibility groups or multiple plasmids. Indeed, gel electrophoresis indicates multiple
plasmids in recipient strains for these cases (not shown).
All additional plasmids were transferred to R for all other measurements.
Growth rates of the additional plasmids RP were obtained using the same
methodology for the engineered system, namely, log-transforming growth curves
from a plate reader fitting the linear portion to a regression. α was calculated in the
same way as described previously, namely, by normalizing the growth rate of R0 by
the growth rate of RP (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Conjugation efficiency estimates for
all native plasmids were performed using R0 as the recipient except for the plasmid
C, which used B0 as recipient. For all ESBL conjugation efficiency estimates, the
native strains were used as donors. Donors with compatible resistance markers
with the plasmid and R0 were used for the remaining plasmids (Supplementary
Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 3A). For the long-term experiments, equal volumes of
R0 and RP were mixed and diluted 10,000× from the overnight culture into a 96-
well plate. Plates were sealed using both sealing membranes and grown for 23 h at
30 °C or 37 °C (see Supplementary Table 1), and shaking at 250 rpm. Every few
days, the percentage of RP remaining in the mixture was quantified using CFU. The
percentage was obtained by spreading diluted culture to a range that resulted in
20–150 countable colonies, which was typically a net of 1 × 107-fold onto Cm and
Cm+Carb plates (but changed depending on the growth rate of the strain being
tested). For all plasmid information, see Supplementary Table 1. Identical protocols
for the engineered system and native plasmids were used for all inhibition
experiments, where the media was supplemented with 3.25 mM Lin or 120 μM
Pheno, or both fresh daily (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 6C).
To initiate the three-species (distinct E. coli strains) three-plasmid experiment,
six populations (R0, Y0, B0, RR6K, YR388, and BRP4) were mixed together in
arbitrary fractions. The mixture was propagated daily every 24 h at a dilution of
10,000×. To quantify population fraction, flow cytometry was used to distinguish
red, yellow and blue fluorescence, and measurements were taken daily. To quantify
plasmid fraction every 3–4 days, selective plating was performed to determine the
fraction of each individual plasmid (CFU from plates containing both Cm and
either Strep, Kan, or Tm divided by CFU obtained from Cm plates). To determine
competition between the three populations, R0, B0, and Y0 only were mixed and
similarly propagated. No CFU measurements were taken as there were no plasmids
present. Note that for this set of experiments, B0 is different from B0 used in the
previous ones, as it expresses CmR chromosomally instead of AmpR.

 Estimating ηCrit. The cost of each plasmid was determined relative to R0, the
plasmid-free counterpart (Supplementary Figs. 3, 6, and Supplementary Table 3).
We assume the plasmid loss rate to be small for all plasmids (0.001 h−1, as with K,
Supplementary Fig. 1A). Indeed, large plasmids (like most conjugal, >20 kb)25 are
typically low copy number to minimize burden60, 76, 77, and therefore often employ
one or more active partitioning mechanisms to promote stable inheritance78–80. To
compare with ηCrit, ηC was determined using R0 as the recipient harvested during
stationary phase (Supplementary Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table 3). Similar to K, we
account for the physiological influence on ηC by using an upper estimate 2.5 × 103
greater than the measured value for comparison with ηCrit.
