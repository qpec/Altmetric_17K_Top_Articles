Abstract
Background: Evidence of the effectiveness of therapy for older children with (developmental) language disorder
(DLD), and particularly those with receptive language impairments, is very limited. The few existing studies have
focused on particular target areas, but none has looked at a whole area of a service.
Aims: To establish whether for students with (developmental) language disorder attending a specialist school,
1:1 intervention with an SLT during one school term improves performance on targeted areas, compared with
untreated control areas. Also, to investigate whether gender, receptive language status, autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) status, or educational Key Stage affected their response to this intervention.
Methods & Procedures: Seventy-two students (aged 9–17 years, 88% of whom had receptive language impairments)
and all speech and language therapists (SLTs) in our specialist school for children with Language Disorder, most
of whom have DLD participated in this study over one school term. During this term, the SLTs devised pre- and
post-therapy measures for every student for each target they planned to treat 1:1. In addition, for each target area,
a control measure was devised. The targets covered a wide range of speech, language and communication areas,
both receptive and expressive. Post-therapy tests were administered ‘blind’.
Outcomes & Results: During the term, SLTs and students worked 1:1 on 120 targets, the majority in the areas of
expressive and receptive language. Targets and controls did not differ pre-therapy. Significant progress was seen
both on targets (d = 1.33) and controls (d = 0.36), but the targeted areas improved significantly more than
the controls with a large and clinically significant effect size (d = 1.06). There was no effect of language area
targeted (targets improved more than their controls for all areas). Participants with versus those without receptive
language difficulties, co-occurring ASD diagnosis or participants in different educational Key Stages did not differ
significantly in terms of the progress they made on target areas.
Conclusions & Implications: Direct 1:1 intervention with an SLT can be effective for all areas of language for
older children with (D)LD, regardless of their gender, receptive language or ASD status, or age. This adds to the
relatively limited evidence base regarding the effectiveness of direct SLT intervention for school-aged children with
(D)LD and for children with receptive language impairments. If direct 1:1 intervention can be effective with this
hard-to-treat group, it may well also be effective with younger children with (D)LD. Thus, direct SLT services
should be available for school-aged children with (D)LD, including older children and adolescents with pervasive
difficulties.

What this paper adds
What we already know
Older children and adolescents with (developmental) language disorder (D)LD are often excluded from services and
have only been included in a few intervention research studies. Progress is difficult to show using standardized tests,
particularly where the children have receptive language impairments. However, when specific areas are targeted and
outcomes in these areas measured, significant progress can be demonstrated. Services for this group of children and
young people need to provide intervention for a wide range of areas of need; for many of these, there is no evidence
base due to limited research with this group.
What this paper adds to existing knowledge
We show that older children and adolescents with (D)LD, including those who have receptive language impairments,
can make progress in a wide range of areas with direct 1:1 therapy with an SLT. Their response to this individualized
intervention is not affected by their receptive language status, a co-occurring diagnosis of ASD, or by educational
Key Stage. The rate of progress on targets relative to their controls was similar for targets rated as ‘achieved’ versus
‘not achieved’.
What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work
Simple outcome measures of whether a target is ‘achieved’ versus ‘not achieved’ should be treated with caution when
no control measure is available for comparison. Older children with (D)LD, including those with receptive language
impairments and those with a Language Disorder associated with ASD, can make good progress with 1:1 direct
therapy with an SLT and thus should not be excluded from clinical services. Children and young people such as those
in this study would often be regarded as hard to treat. Therefore, if direct 1:1 intervention can be effective with this
group, it may well also be effective with younger children with (D)LD.
Introduction
Approximately 7% of children have a developmen-
tal language disorder (DLD) when they enter school
(Tomblin et al. 1997) and for some, this persists into
adolescence, affecting their educational achievements
(Conti-Ramsden 2008) and into adulthood, affecting
their employment prospects (e.g., Law et al. 2009). Chil-
dren with both receptive and expressive language im-
pairments are most likely to have persisting difficulties
(Beitchman et al. 1996, Tomblin et al. 2003). Indeed,
Clark et al. (2007) found that only two of 58 children
with severe receptive language impairments at school en-
try had language scores in the normal range 6 years later.
Despite the long-term difficulties of children with
DLD, particularly those with both receptive and
expressive language impairments, few intervention
studies have been carried out including these children
(see Ebbels 2014 for a review). This is particularly the
case for secondary school-aged children and adolescents,
who also receive limited professional services (Dockrell
et al. 2006) and have been included in only a handful of
studies (Bishop et al. 2006, Bragard et al. 2012, Ebbels
and van der Lely 2001, Ebbels 2007, Ebbels et al.
2007, 2012, 2014, Hyde-Wright et al. 1993). However,
it could be argued that children with such persisting
difficulties are most in need of intervention as their dif-
ficulties are very unlikely to resolve spontaneously. The
participants in these studies all had receptive language
impairments, which is perhaps unsurprising given
the link between persistence of difficulties and the pres-
ence of receptive language impairments. However, stud-
ies including secondary-aged children with persisting
DLD where receptive language is relatively intact are
severely lacking.
Of the few studies that have investigated interven-
tion for older primary and secondary-aged children
with DLD including those with receptive language dif-
ficulties, several have failed to find any significant effects
of intervention (Bishop et al. 2006, Boyle et al. 2009,
Gillam et al. 2008, McCartney et al. 2011), despite in
some studies more than 20 h of intervention being pro-
vided (19–25 h in Boyle et al. 2009, 50 h in Gillam et al.
2008) on a range of targets and language areas. However,
in the Boyle et al. (2009) study, unlike the children with
receptive language impairments, children with expres-
sive language difficulties but good receptive language
did make progress. Thus, it seems that children with
receptive language impairments are not only more likely
to have difficulties which persist into secondary school,
but also are more difficult to treat. However, the above
studies covered a range of targets and language areas and
only used global standardized tests, where it is difficult
to show progress after a short period of intervention.
Other studies have used more specific measures of
progress which are more closely related to the target
of intervention. These studies have generally had more
positive results with children with receptive language
impairments and have found significant progress with
therapy targeting receptive vocabulary (Parsons et al.

2005, Throneburg et al. 2000), word finding (Ebbels
et al. 2012, Hyde-Wright et al. 1993), production
and comprehension of specific grammatical structures
(Ebbels and van der Lely 2001, Ebbels 2007, Ebbels
et al. 2007, 2014) and general text and sentence com-
prehension (Joffe et al. 2007, Tallal et al. 1996). Several
of these studies provided less than 5 h of intervention
(Ebbels et al. 2007, 2012, 2014, Joffe et al. 2007), while
others provided between 5 and 10 h of intervention
(Ebbels 2007, Ebbels et al. 2007, Parsons et al. 2005,
Throneburg et al. 2000, Hyde-Wright et al. 1993).
Thus, it seems that school-aged children with receptive
language impairments can be shown to make progress
with even relatively small amounts of intervention when
that intervention is targeted to a specific area and the
outcome measures are closely linked to the intervention.
It should be noted that the participants in all these stud-
ies (with the exception of Throneburg et al. 2000) had
DLD of sufficient severity that they were either receiving
specialist education in specialist language school (studies
by Ebbels and colleagues and Hyde-Wright et al. 1993)
or receiving support from a language resource base
(Parsons et al. 2005) or language unit (Joffe et al. 2007).
As a team of speech and language therapists (SLTs)
working in a specialist school for children aged 7–19
years with severe, persistent Language Disorder (mostly
DLD), the majority of whom have receptive language
impairments, the evidence of progress with specific
language targets for this group is encouraging and we
routinely use the methods from the above studies in our
therapy sessions when targeting related areas. However,
the range of therapy targets and methods provided
in our usual practice is much wider than those in the
published studies above due to the mismatch between
the wide range of needs and the limited evidence base.
Targets and therapy methods are determined by indi-
vidual SLTs, taking into consideration the specific needs
of the student, the views of the students, their parents
and teachers as well as the potential functional impact
progress on any target may have on their life either at
home or school. Because of the lack of an evidence base
to inform much of our intervention, we wanted to know
whether our SLT provision as routinely provided was
effective. Due to the wide range of targets and methods
and the fact that all students in the school were receiving
therapy, the effectiveness of this therapy can be hard
to evaluate. However, a study with younger children
(Mecrow et al. 2010) provided a suitable study design.
Mecrow et al. (2010) considered the effectiveness
of an ‘enhanced consultative model’ with children
(aged 4;2–6;10) attending mainstream primary schools
in Key Stage 1 (from Reception to Year 2 in the
UK, when children are aged 4–7 years). All children
scored 1.5 SD below the mean on percentage of
phonemes correct or receptive or expressive language on
standardized tests. Thus, they had a range of profiles
of speech and language abilities (22/35 had receptive
language difficulties). Mecrow and colleagues investi-
gated the effectiveness of 1:1 intervention provided by
assistants. These assistants were employed to work un-
der the guidance of SLTs or specialist language teachers
and made available to schools to work with individual
children. They compared progress on (individualized)
targeted versus control areas. Progress on targets (a mix-
ture of speech and language, receptive and expressive)
was significantly greater than progress on control areas.
However, they did not analyse whether the effectiveness
of this model of therapy provision varied between target
areas or between different groups of children.
We used the Mecrow et al. study as a model to evalu-
ate the effectiveness of part of our therapy service (direct
therapy provided 1:1 by an SLT). As we had a greater
number of potential participants than Mecrow et al.,
we also aimed to analyse any differences in response to
intervention with respect to target area and participant
characteristics. The majority of our students (but not
all) have receptive language impairments. Given that the
previous literature tends to show less convincing progress
for children with receptive language impairments (Boyle
et al. 2009, Law et al. 2003), we investigated whether
having poor receptive language affected progress on tar-
gets selected for each individual student. A minority of
our students have a diagnosis of autism spectrum disor-
der (ASD) in addition to their language disorder. This
could also affect response to intervention, so we also
analysed whether the presence of ASD affected progress.
The final characteristic we considered was gender. This
is because while girls are in the minority in our school,
they tend to have more severe language impairments and
thus, they may respond differently to intervention.
In the school, each student has a ‘core SLT’ for 1:1
therapy. Collaborative teaching, planned and delivered
jointly by the teacher and SLT, is also a key feature (par-
ticularly in English, science, PSHCE [Personal, Social,
Health and Citizenship Education], social and life skills
lessons, but also in some other specialist subject lessons).
In addition the students participate in group work with
an SLT who may or may not be their core SLT. In Key
Stages 2 (years 3–6, aged 7–11 years) and 3 (years 7–9,
aged 11–14 years), students receive at least two paired or
individual sessions per week with their core SLT (many
receive more; this depends on their needs as detailed in
their statement of Special Educational Needs or Edu-
cation, Health and Care Plan), at least one group SLT
session and collaborative class teaching. In Key Stage 4
(years 10–11, aged 14–16 years), students receive at least
one paired or individual session with their core SLT per
week, at least two group SLT sessions and collaborative
class teaching. Due to the differences in provision
during the different Key Stages, we also investigated
 4

whether progress differed by educational Key Stage. In
this study, in order to reduce the number of variables,
we only evaluated the effectiveness of therapy provided
1:1 by each student’s core SLT during one school term.
Aims
The primary research question was: In students with
severe (D)LD attending a specialist school, does
1:1 therapy with an SLT during one school term
improve performance on targeted areas, compared
with untreated control areas and does this vary with
area of language targeted? The two secondary research
questions were: (1) In targets rated as ‘achieved’ versus
‘not achieved’, does progress on targets relative to their
controls differ? and (2) In students with severe (D)LD
attending a specialist school, do gender, receptive
language status, ASD status, or educational Key Stage
affect response to 1:1 intervention with an SLT?
Method
Participants
This study was carried out at a specialist day and residen-
tial school for students with Language Disorder in the
UK. At the start of the study 75 students attended the
school and all had a statement of Special Educational
Needs. The school currently caters for students aged
7–19, but at the time of the study the post-16 college
provision had only recently opened and students attend-
ing the college were not included in this study. The age
of the students attending the school provision at the time
ranged from 9 to 17 years; we had no students aged 7–8
at the time and one student had been held back a year
and therefore was 17, but still in the school provision.
Of these 75 students, during the term of the project,
72 received individual therapy on at least one target
with an SLT (others received paired therapy with an
SLT during that term). These 72 students are the partic-
ipants in this study. Some participants also received 1:1
therapy with an SLT assistant, but the numbers were too
small to include. All SLTs in the school were involved.
Of the 72 participants, 63 (88%) had receptive lan-
guage impairments (< 85 on receptive language index of
CELF-4; Semel et al. 2006), 20 (28%) had a diagnosis of
ASD and 20 (28%) were girls. Seven participants (10%)
were in Key Stage 2 (years 3–6, aged 7–11), 39 (54%)
were in Key Stage 3 (years, 7–9, aged 11–14) and 26
(36%) were in Key Stage 4 (years 10–11, aged 14–16).
Table 1 gives a summary of the participants’ ages and
performance on standardized tests. Most of those with
one or more scores in the normal range on these tests
had language difficulties which were more pragmatic in
nature (indeed some had a diagnosis of ASD).

Study design
Routine SLT (and indeed occupational therapy) provi-
sion within the school involves setting individual targets
for each student at the beginning of each term. The core
SLT is free to choose which targets (and how many) to
focus on with each student and the method of therapy
(although these are checked by an SLT Team Leader
to ensure consistency of provision across the school).
Pre-therapy performance on each target area is assessed
and recorded in a database. The SLT then sets a goal for
each student and each target against which post-therapy
performance will be rated as ‘achieved’ or not. At the
end of each term, performance is reassessed and a
rating of ‘achieved’ versus ‘not achieved’ is recorded,
along with the actual score. These outcomes are used to
monitor therapy provision and student progress.
The routine target-setting process was expanded for
the purposes of this study during one school term to
enable us to use a similar design to Mecrow et al. (2010),
where each participant served as their own control.
For every area of speech, language and communication
which was targeted during 1:1 SLT sessions, both a
target and a control measure was devised by the core
SLT. The only stipulation was that all targets and their
control measures had to be designed in such a way that
any score could be converted to a percentage. In most
cases, this was achieved by converting points achieved
out of possible points to a percentage, e.g., 14/20 =
70%. In a few cases, particularly those focusing more on
function rather than impairment, ratings of 0–5 were
converted to a percentage (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%,
100%). We are aware that these are more unreliable,
but we felt this was a desirable step in order to be able
to include all areas of our 1:1 intervention in this study.
The control measures (which would not receive any
intervention) had to be related to the target, but not
so closely related that work on the target might be ex-
pected to generalize to improve performance on the
control measure. The measures were mostly devised by
the individual SLTs (with help from other SLTs in the
project) for the specific participants they were working
with. However, some measures were shared and used
with several participants. Indeed, the majority of tar-
gets and controls involving receptive vocabulary used
the same tests and therapy method, as we carried out

a more detailed project (Wright et al. 2016), consider-
ing just this area as part of the bigger overall project
reported here. For each participant, the same assess-
ments of their performance on their target and control
measures were used pre- and post-therapy. For those in
the vocabulary project, all assessments were carried out
‘blind’ by an SLT assistant employed by the school. For
the remainder of the participants, their core SLT carried
out the pre-therapy assessments (at the beginning of the
term), but their post-therapy assessments were carried
out ‘blind’ by another SLT (at the end of the term). For
the post-therapy assessments, all SLTs partnered another
SLT who was unfamiliar with the details of their work.
They handed all their assessment tasks to their partner,
who did not know which assessments were assessing tar-
get areas and which were assessing control areas. Then,
for one week, the SLTs assessed all the participants who
had had intervention with their partner SLT. Thus, pre-
therapy assessments were not blind and were carried out
by a familiar SLT, but post-therapy assessments were
blind and carried out by an SLT unfamiliar to each par-
ticipant. Therefore, any bias due to familiarity or lack
of blinding of the assessors is likely to be in favour of
the pre-therapy testing. So, any scores which are higher
at post-therapy than pre-therapy are unlikely to be due
to assessor bias and are more likely to be due to prac-
tice effects, maturation, the general school curriculum,
or other non-specific effects or (for the targeted areas
only) the 1:1 SLT intervention provided. The control
measures were crucial in order to control for the non-
specific effects which can arise through carrying out test-
ing twice. Thus, in our analyses we were interested in any
differences in progress on controls (which should be due
to non-specific effects) and targets (which should be due
to non-specific effects plus any effect of intervention).
Targets versus controls
Devising control measures for a wide range of target
measures was challenging. For some targets, we had
lists of specific items (e.g., words) which would be
targeted and a list of other items which would act as
controls. For other targets, the control was a related
task within the same general area. For some targets
where generalization was expected (e.g., previous work
showed generalization for semantic therapy with word
finding, Ebbels et al. 2012), another target area was
used. For examples of each of these types of targets,
see table 2. For brief details of the targets, controls and
therapy methods used, see appendices A–E.
Results
Analyses by target
In total, during the term of the study, the 72 partic-
ipants worked on 120 targets between them in 1:1
intervention sessions with their core SLT. This is a mean
of 1.67 targets per participant: 28 (39%) participants
had one 1:1 SLT target, 38 (52%) had two and six (8%)
had three. The broad areas targeted and the number
and percentage are shown in table 3. The majority
of targets focused on receptive or expressive language.
Within these, the majority of expressive language
targets focused on grammar and word finding and
the majority of receptive language targets focused on
receptive vocabulary (see appendices A–E for details).
The mean number of hours spent on each target was
4.2 h (SD = 1.73 h, range: 0.5–10.5 h). Sessions were
usually 30 min long and each SLT was free to choose
how much time in each session to spend on each target
and over how many weeks to work on each target.
Figure 1 shows the pre- and post-therapy scores on
targets and controls averaged over all the targets. This

shows that pre-therapy scores on targets and controls
were similar (indeed a paired samples t-test confirmed
this, t(119) = 0.14, p = 0.89, d = 0.05) and that on
average the participants made more progress on targets
(30%) than their controls (8%). Figure 2 shows the
change in score (post- minus pre-therapy scores) for
targets and controls, split by broad target area (shown in
order of frequency). This shows that targets improved
more than controls in all areas, although the gap was
smaller for social skills/pragmatics. We analysed progress
of targets and controls using change scores as the same
tests were carried out with each participant pre- and
post-therapy. A 2 × 5 analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with a within-subjects factor of type (target versus con-
trol) and a between-subjects factor target area (expressive
language, receptive language, academic skills, social
skills/pragmatics and phonological awareness) was car-
ried out. This showed a significant main effect of Type,

type and target area, F(4) = 1.7, p = .15, ƞp2 = 0.06.
This shows that all target areas had a similar general
pattern, where targets improved more than controls.
In order to establish whether progress on targets
or controls was significantly different from zero, we
carried out one-sample t-tests across all areas combined
(due to the lack of interaction shown above). This
showed that progress was significantly different from
zero on targets, t(119) = 14.6, p < .001, d = 1.33 and
controls, t(119) = 4.0, p < .001, d = 0.36. However,
the effect size was much greater for the targets, as would
be expected from the finding above that progress on
targets was significantly greater than controls with a
large and clinically significant effect size.
Targets ‘achieved’ versus ‘not achieved’
As part of the target-setting system used within the
school, each SLT has to set a goal for each student
for each target pre-therapy. Post-therapy, each target
is rated as ‘achieved’ or ‘not achieved’, according to
whether the goal was reached or not. This judgement
depends on both the amount of progress made and
the level of the goal. Thus, a student could make good
progress but still not reach the goal. Thus, we would
expect progress on those targets rated as ‘achieved’ to be
on average higher than those ‘not achieved’. However,
we wanted to see whether the students’ progress on
those targets which were ‘not achieved’ was still greater
than their paired controls (i.e., did the students make
significant progress on these targets even though they
did not achieve their goal).
A total of 97 targets were rated as ‘achieved’ and
23 as ‘not achieved’. The degree of change from pre-
to post-therapy on targets versus their controls, split by
whether the targets were rated post-therapy as ‘achieved’
versus ‘not achieved’ is shown in figure 3. This shows
that the difference between targets and their controls

is similar, regardless of whether the target was rated as
‘achieved’ or not. As expected, the degree of change is
greater for those targets rated as ‘achieved’, as greater
progress is more likely to pass a threshold. A 2 × 5
ANOVA with a within-subjects factor of type (target
versus control) and a between-subjects factor target
of achieved status (‘achieved’ versus ‘not achieved’)
was carried out using the change scores (post- minus
pre-therapy) as the dependent variable. As with previous
analyses this showed a main effect of type, F(1) = 54.4,
p < .001, ƞp2 = 0.32, where the change in targets was
greater than controls. As expected, we also found a main
effect of whether the target was rated as ‘achieved’ versus
‘not achieved’, F(1) = 29.1, p < .001, ƞp2 = 0.20,
where greater progress was found on targets rated as
‘achieved’. However, we found no interaction between
type and achieved status, F(1) = 0.27, p = .61, ƞp2 =
0.002. This shows that while those targets rated as
‘achieved’ showed more progress than those rated as ‘not
achieved’, their controls paralleled their progress. The
gap between targets and their controls was similar in
those rated as ‘achieved’ versus ‘not achieved’ (indeed,
although not significant, the gap was numerically
greater in those targets rated as ‘not achieved’).
Analyses by participant
We were also interested in any possible effects of
participant characteristics on progress with therapy.
Most participants had worked on more than one target
during the term. Therefore, for the following analyses,
for each participant who had more than one target,
we computed their mean pre-therapy score and their
mean post-therapy score on both targets and controls
regardless of target area.
The participant characteristics which we considered
could have influenced response to therapy were: gender
(male versus female), receptive language status (< 85
versus > 85 on the CELF-4 Receptive Language Index),
ASD status (diagnosis of ASD versus no diagnosis) and
Key Stage (2, 3, 4). The results for targets versus control
measures split by each characteristic are shown in table 4.
This shows all change scores for targets are higher than
change scores for controls, regardless of how we split the
participants. Any effect of a participant characteristic
on response to intervention would be revealed by a
predictor variable having a significant effect on the
outcome variable. We calculated an outcome for each
participant as mean progress on all targets minus mean
progress on all controls (regardless of area of language
targeted) to capture the difference made by intervention
as opposed to general non-specific factors which would
also be expected to affect the control areas. Because the
predictor factors were interrelated (particularly ASD sta-
tus and gender, where most participants with ASD were
boys), we carried out a multiple regression analysis with
four predictors: gender, ASD status, receptive language
status, school Key Stage (Key Stage 2 and 3 combined
due to small numbers in Key Stage 2 versus Key Stage
4). All predictors were entered together. The model
which emerged was not significant, F(4, 67) = 1.2, p =
.31, R2adj = .01, but receptive language status emerged
as a significant predictor, ß = –.26, p = .04. However,
when a further regression analysis was carried out with
just receptive language status entered as a predictor,
the model was again not significant, F(1,70) = 3.3,
p = .07, R2adj = .03.
Discussion
A total of 120 targets were delivered 1:1 by SLTs during
the term in which this study took place for an average of
4.2 h per target. These focused on a range of areas. The
majority were on receptive and expressive language,
with fewer targets focusing on academic and social skills
(these are more often targeted in groups, with 1:1 work
on these areas usually reserved for those with the most
severe difficulties in these areas) and phonological aware-
ness (a specialist literacy teacher focuses on literacy dif-
ficulties, so SLTs have less of a role in this area). Progress

on targets (30%) was significantly greater than progress
on control measures (8%) with a large and clinically
significant effect size (d = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02–1.09),
regardless of target area. This indicates that the 1:1
intervention provided by the SLTs was effective across
a range of areas. Analyses of participant characteristics
showed no effects on response to intervention of gender,
ASD status, receptive language status, or Key Stage.
The findings of significant progress on targeted
areas with therapy is similar to other studies which
included secondary-aged students where the outcomes
were closely related to the intervention provided (Ebbels
and van der Lely 2001, Ebbels 2007, Ebbels et al.
2007, 2012, 2014, Hyde-Wright et al. 1993). However,
our study covered a much wider range of target areas
than these previous studies. We also evaluated the
effectiveness of therapy as routinely provided in our
setting. The only change from therapy as usual, was the
addition of the control measures. Thus, our results show
that 1:1 direct intervention with an SLT (including
for receptive language), can be effective for these older
children with severe (D)LD, most of whom also had
receptive language impairments.
The number of hours per target (average of 4.2
h, maximum 10.5 h) was relatively low compared to
some other studies in which participants with receptive
language impairments received more than 20 h of
intervention (Boyle et al. 2009, Ebbels and van der Lely
2001, Gillam et al. 2008, Mecrow et al. 2010, Tallal et al.
1996) with little obvious effect on receptive language
in two cases (Boyle et al. 2009, Gillam et al. 2008).
However, the number of hours of intervention was
comparable to other studies with positive results where
the participants received less than 10 h of intervention
(Ebbels 2007, Ebbels et al. 2007, 2012, 2014, Joffe et al.
2007, Parsons et al. 2005, Throneburg et al. 2000).
This shows that even a relatively small amount of direct
therapy can have a significant effect, especially where the
intervention and outcome measures are closely related.
The analyses of progress with therapy split by
whether a target was ‘achieved’ or not, showed that
targets with greater progress were more likely to be rated
as ‘achieved’. However, our results also show that much
of the difference between targets which were ‘achieved’
versus ‘not achieved’ was probably due to non-specific
factors which also affected the controls. Those targets
rated as ‘not achieved’ showed a similar gap with their
controls (where performance got worse on average).
Thus, it seems that factors such as having a ‘good’ or
‘bad day’ could be affecting the likelihood of a target
being rated as ‘achieved’ versus ‘not achieved’. The
control items control for these non-specific effects and
show that on average, progress (relative to controls) was
similar both on targets which were ‘achieved’ and ‘not
achieved’. This has implications for the conclusions
drawn from the results of target setting in the absence
of controls. Larger versus smaller amounts of progress
could be due to non-specific effects rather than those
directly related to the intervention per se and are thus
very difficult to interpret in the absence of any control
measures. Making clinical decisions based on the
amount of progress made, or when a student exceeded
an arbitrary goal, is therefore likely to be unreliable in
the absence of controls.
Limitations and future directions
The study had no control group because we wanted to
evaluate the effectiveness of a whole service within a par-
ticular specialist educational provision. While it might
have been possible to use students of a similar age at-
tending other provisions as a control group (particularly
as many students of this age receive little or no direct
intervention with an SLT), such students are likely to
differ in fundamental ways from those in our study.
This is due to the non-random nature of the processes
involved in accessing specialist educational provisions.
In order to provide some degree of experimental
control, we used control measures for each target.
Significant progress was also found on these measures
(although significantly less than the targets). Due to the
lack of a control group, it is not possible to say whether
progress on the controls was due to maturation, practice
effects, other group intervention received, collaborative
teaching in the classroom or indeed generalization
of therapy. However, we were able to conclude that
progress on the targeted areas was not due to such factors
(as these would have affected both targets and control
measures), but that the additional progress shown on the
targets when compared with the controls was most likely
due to the focus on these areas in 1:1 therapy sessions.
In future studies using this design, the findings
would be strengthened if following the first phase of
intervention, a second phase followed in which the
control areas were targeted. This would mean that
these areas would have a baseline period in which
they received no intervention, followed by a period of
intervention. Thus, progress during the baseline period
could be compared with progress with intervention.
If greater progress is seen with intervention during
phase two on the initial control areas, this would show
that these areas were not inherently more difficult to
improve than the original target areas. Further testing
of the original target after this term of intervention on
the original control area would also enable investigation
of whether the participants maintained the progress
made on the original targets.
In order to investigate whether therapy generalizes to
other related items, it would also be desirable to include
additional measures pre- and post-therapy of items/areas

where generalization is expected and compare the change
on these generalization tests with change on the control
tests (where generalization is not expected). Differences
between the two would most likely be related to
generalization and not to practice effects. Indeed, in this
study we deliberately avoided including items where
generalization was expected as then we would lose our
experimental control. However, if generalization is a
particular focus of investigation a better design is to
include a (waiting) control group of participants. The
difference in progress on the generalization measures for
the control versus experimental group could be analysed
to investigate generalization (see for example, Ebbels
et al. 2014 for generalization to a standardized test).
This study only considered therapy outcomes in one
school term. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions
from this study regarding the wider impact of the ther-
apy. We have other studies underway which consider
the longer-term effectiveness of the overall provision
of the school in terms of changes on standardized tests
of language, literacy and numeracy, the links between
these and educational achievements and also the impact
on independence and quality of life.
Conclusions and implications for clinical
practice
Direct 1:1 intervention with an SLT can be effective for
all areas of language for older children and adolescents
with (D)LD, regardless of their gender, receptive lan-
guage or ASD status, or age. This adds to the relatively
limited evidence base regarding the effectiveness of
direct SLT intervention for (older) school-aged children
with (D)LD and for school-aged children with receptive
language impairments. Children and young people
such as those in our study would often be regarded as
hard to treat. Therefore, if direct 1:1 intervention can
be effective with this group, it may well also be effective
with younger children with (D)LD. Thus, direct SLT
services should be available for school-aged children
with (D)LD, including older children and adolescents
with severe, pervasive and persistent (D)LD.
