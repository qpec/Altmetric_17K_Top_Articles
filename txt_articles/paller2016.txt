Background: Additional topical treatments for atopic dermatitis (AD) are needed that provide relief while
minimizing risks.
Objective: We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of crisaborole ointment, a phosphodiesterase 4
inhibitor, in two phase III AD studies (AD-301: NCT02118766; AD-302: NCT02118792).
Methods: Two identically designed, vehicle-controlled, double-blind studies enrolled and randomly
assigned (2:1, crisaborole:vehicle) patients aged 2 years or older with an Investigator’s Static Global
Assessment (ISGA) score of mild or moderate for twice-daily application for 28 days. The primary end point
was ISGA score at day 29 of clear (0)/almost clear (1) with 2-grade or greater improvement from baseline.
Additional analyses included time to success in ISGA score, percentage of patients achieving clear/almost
clear, reduction in severity of AD signs, and time to improvement in pruritus.
Results: More crisaborole- than vehicle-treated patients achieved ISGA score success (clear/almost clear
with $2-grade improvement; AD-301: 32.8% vs 25.4%, P = .038; AD-302: 31.4% vs 18.0%, P \.001), with a

Crisaborole-treated patients achieved success in ISGA score and improvement in pruritus earlier than those
treated with vehicle (both P # .001). Treatment-related adverse events were infrequent and mild to
moderate in severity.
Limitations: Short study duration was a limitation.
Conclusions: Crisaborole demonstrated a favorable safety profile and improvement in all measures
of efficacy, including overall disease severity, pruritus, and other signs of AD. ( J Am Acad Dermatol

Atopic dermatitis (AD), a
complex chronic inflamma-
tory
skin
disease
chara-
cterized
by
erythematous,
eczematous
lesions
and
often intense pruritus,1-3 is
prevalent
worldwide
and
affects
both
children
and
adults, with up to 90% of
patients
presenting
with
mild to moderate disease.4,5
AD-associated
pruritus
re-
sults in frequent scratching
and contributes significant
psychological,
social,
and
quality-of-life
burdens
to
patients and their families.6-8
It also generates a substantial
financial burden, with cost
estimates of up to $3.8 billion annually in the
United States alone.9 More than 80% of children
with AD have persistence of symptoms into their
adult
years,
a
percentage
much
higher
than
previously appreciated.10 In addition, AD is often
associated with significant comorbidities, including
asthma and allergic rhinitis.1,2,8
Topical treatments are commonly prescribed to
alleviate AD symptoms, reduce inflammation, and
prevent flares,11 but no new molecules have been
approved for the treatment of AD in the past 15 years,
and treatment guidelines recommend the use of
topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin
inhibitors (TCI), or both.3,8 Despite their efficacy,
both TCS and TCI are associated with limitations in
their use as a result of application reactions and
safety concerns with long-term use. Long-term TCS
use is restricted to avoid local cutaneous atrophy
(especially in sensitive and thin-skinned areas such
as face and groin), striae formation, and systemic
side effects,3,8 TCIs are associated with burning/
stinging upon application and require enhanced
patient education because of a boxed warning for
increased
risk
of
lym-
phoma.3,8,12,13 Hence, novel
topical therapies that may
potentially
improve
upon
the
risk-benefit
profile
of
current therapies are needed.
Phosphodiesterase4(PDE4)
is a key regulator of inflamma-
tory cytokine production in
AD through the degradation
of cyclic adenosine mono-
phosphate.14,15 PDE4 activity
is increased in circulating in-
flammatory cells of patients
with AD,16-19 and the inhibi-
tion of PDE4 in monocytes
in
vitro
has
demonstrated
reduction in the release of
proinflammatory cytokines.20
The oral PDE4 inhibitor apremilast was recently
approved for treatment of moderate to severe plaque
psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but requires dose
titration to avoid gastrointestinal side effects (nausea
and diarrhea) because of PDE4 inhibition in nontarget
tissues.21,22 A topical PDE4 inhibitor formulation
could address the need for targeted inhibition of
inflammation in skin diseases while avoiding un-
wanted side effects.
The novel boron chemistry of crisaborole enables
synthesis of a low-molecular-weight compound
(251 d) that facilitates effective penetration through
human skin.23 Crisaborole enhances cellular control
of inflammation by inhibiting PDE4 and its ability to
degrade
intracellular
cyclic
adenosine
mono-
phosphate,15,24-27 thereby suppressing the release
of cytokines by affecting downstream regulation
of
the
nuclear
factor-kB
and
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T-cell
signaling
pathways.14,23,28,29
Although systemic exposure to crisaborole may
vary with the percentage of body surface area
involved, it is rapidly and substantially metabolized
to inactive metabolites that have no effect on PDE4

 activity or cytokine release, thus limiting systemic
exposure and reducing the risk of adverse effects.30
Preclinical analysis in rats and mice revealed that
crisaborole is noncarcinogenic, and early clinical
data31-33 demonstrated a favorable safety profile for
crisaborole in children as young as 2 years of age.
Two pivotal phase III studies were performed to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of crisaborole 2%
ointment in patients aged 2 years of age or older with
mild to moderate AD.
METHODS
Study design and oversight
Two identically designed multicenter, random-
ized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase III
clinical studies conducted in the United States
(ClinicalTrials.gov AD-301: NCT02118766; AD-302:
NCT02118792) assessed the efficacy and safety of
crisaborole in patients with mild to moderate AD.
Study protocols were developed and conducted, and
data were recorded and reported by the study
sponsor (Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc) in accor-
dance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice
and relevant country-specific regulatory require-
ments. At each participating investigational center
(47 and 42 investigational centers for AD-301 and
AD-302, respectively), the institutional review board
approved all study protocols, informed consent/
assent forms, and relevant supporting data. No
participants
(principal
investigator,
study
staff,
participants,
nor
parents/guardians)
knew
the
treatment assignment, and blinding was maintained
throughout clinical management, data management,
and statistical evaluation until a database lock memo
was issued.
Patients
Patients were randomized via the interactive
World
Wide
Web
response
system
2:1
to
receive crisaborole:vehicle treatment (Fig 1 and
Supplementary Fig 1). Key inclusion criteria required
patients to be aged 2 years or older and have a
clinical diagnosis of AD according to Hanifin and
Rajka34 criteria, 5% or more treatable body surface
area involvement, and a baseline Investigator’s Static
Global Assessment (ISGA) score of mild (2) or
moderate (3) (Supplementary Fig 1). Key exclusion
criteria prohibited previous use of biologic therapy
or systemic corticosteroids within 28 days or TCS or
TCI use within 14 days. Patients with active skin
infections were excluded (Supplementary Fig 1).
Patients on stable regimens (consistent use $14 days
before day 1) of inhaled corticosteroids, antihista-
mines, and topical retinoids for non-AD lesion
treatment were allowed to continue their medica-
tions. Patients were also allowed to use acceptable
bland emollients to manage dry skin areas around,
but not overlapping, the treatable AD-involved
areas.
Crisaborole ointment treatment
Patients were instructed to apply a layer of study
drug to cover each lesion twice daily throughout the
28-day study to all areas affected by AD at baseline.
The scalp was excluded from treatment to avoid
potential
patient
dissatisfaction
with
ointment
application to scalp hair. Patients and caregivers
were provided with documentation for designated
treatment areas at each visit and instructed to apply
additional study drug as needed to newly identified
AD lesions that appeared after day 1. Application
instructions were reviewed at scheduled weekly
in-clinic visits (days 8, 15, and 22).
Evaluation
The primary efficacy end point of success in ISGA
score at day 29 was defined as clear (0) or almost
clear (1) with a 2-grade or more improvement from
baseline (Supplementary Table I). Analysis of the
secondary
efficacy
end
points
included
the
proportion of patients with an ISGA score of clear
(0) or almost clear (1) at day 29, and time to success
in ISGA score. Additional predefined end points
assessed pruritus severity and signs of AD (erythema,
exudation, excoriation, induration/papulation, and
lichenification). Pruritus severity was recorded twice
daily by the patient or parent/caregiver via electronic
diary. Signs of AD were measured throughout the
treatment period on investigator visit days 1, 8, 15,
22, and 29. Pruritus and signs of AD were measured
on a 4-point scale of none (0), mild (1), moderate (2),
and severe (3) (Supplementary Tables II and III).
Improvement in these measures was defined as
achieving none (0) or mild (1) with a 1-grade or
more improvement from baseline. Change in the
severity of each sign of AD was calculated as
percentage change from baseline. Primary safety
assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital

unscheduled doctor visits, and at the end of the
study. Cardiac safety was assessed in a subset of
participants with electrocardiography as a safety
parameter required by the US Food and Drug
Administration.
Statistical analysis
The sample size was selected for efficacy to yield
at least 90% power to achieve a statistically signifi-
cant difference (2-sided test at a = .05), assuming
success rates of 20% (crisaborole-treated group) and
10% (vehicle-treated group). Efficacy analyses were
performed
using
the
intent-to-treat
population,
which
included
all
patients
randomized
and
dispensed study drug, regardless of discontinuation.
The odds ratio of success in ISGA score at day 29 and
secondary end points were tested between treatment
groups using logistic regression with factors for
treatment group and analysis center. Time to success
in ISGA score and time to improvement in pruritus
were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methods and the
log-rank test. Severity of signs of AD and pruritus
were evaluated using descriptive statistics. The
analyzed safety population included all patients
who were randomized, were confirmed to have
received 1 or more doses of the study drug, and
who received 1 or more postbaseline assessments.
For treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), the frequency
of patients with 1 or more TEAEs was tabulated and a
Fisher exact test was performed on any TEAE that
occurred at a frequency of 1% or greater. In addition,
a
Fisher
exact
test
was
performed
for
any
treatment-related event that occurred at a frequency
of 1% or greater within any treatment group.
RESULTS
Patients and enrollment
The
intent-to-treat
population
consisted
of
503:256 and 513:250 patients randomly assigned to
receive crisaborole:vehicle, for AD-301 and AD-302,
respectively (Supplementary Fig 1). There were no
significant differences across treatment groups or
across studies in baseline demographics and disease
severity (Table I).

 patients (AD-301: 32.8% vs 25.4%, P = .038; AD-302:
31.4% vs 18.0%, P \ .001) (Fig 2, A). In addition,
Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients
treated with crisaborole achieved success in ISGA
score earlier than those treated with vehicle ointment
(P \ .001) (Fig 2, B). More patients achieved ISGA
scores of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with crisaborole
at day 29 (AD-301: 51.7% vs 40.6%, P = .005; AD-302:
48.5% vs 29.7%, P \.001) (Fig 2, C ).
Crisaborole improved disease severity as evi-
denced by reduction in signs and symptoms of AD
(Fig 2, D and E ), including pruritus. Crisaborole-
treated patients achieved improvement in pruritus
earlier than vehicle-treated patients (pooled data,
1.37 vs 1.70 days, P = .001). Across all visits, a greater
proportion of crisaborole-treated patients achieved
improvement in pruritus (pooled data, days 8, 15, 22:
P\.001; day 29: P = .002) (Fig 3). For all clinical signs
of AD, a greater proportion of crisaborole-treated
patients than vehicle-treated patients demonstrated
improvement at day 29 (Fig 4, A), along with a
greater reduction in mean severity (pooled data,
erythema: P\.001; exudation: P = .001; excoriation:
P \ .001; induration/papulation: P = .002; lichen-
ification: P \.001) (Fig 4, B).
Safety end points
Crisaborole demonstrated a favorable safety pro-
file in which the majority of TEAEs reported were
mild to moderate in severity (pooled data, crisabor-
ole: 94.3% of TEAEs; vehicle: 96.9% of TEAEs), and
most were considered unrelated or unlikely to be
related to treatment (pooled data, crisaborole: 78.6%;
vehicle: 84.2%). Treatment with crisaborole was well
tolerated, with similar rates of TEAEs as vehicle
(Table II). The majority of treatment-related AEs
were application site pain, primarily reported as
burning or stinging (Table II). Application site pain
was the only treatment-related AE that occurred in
1% or more of patients. Of the patients with
application site pain, 76.7% reported it on the first
day of treatment, and 77.6% had resolution within
1 day of onset. No reports of treatment-related
serious AEs were reported. The rates of study
discontinuation because of AEs were the same in
the crisaborole (1.2%) and vehicle (1.2%) treatment
groups. In addition, no clinically meaningful differ-
ences were observed in patients’ vital signs, electro-
cardiograms, and clinical laboratory parameters
between treatment groups.
DISCUSSION
Crisaborole ointment, a novel PDE4 inhibitor,
significantly reduced the signs and symptoms of
AD in children and adults in these two phase III
studies. Its positive efficacy profile was based on: (1)
improvement in disease severity, as early as day 8 of
treatment; (2) reduction in AD signs and symptoms;
and (3) early and sustained improvement in pruritus.
This novel medication showed relief of pruritus,
which is important for AD treatment, as disruption of
the itch-scratch cycle can mitigate AD signs, improve
quality of life,35 and reduce the risk for infection and
scarring.6
The significant efficacy of crisaborole versus
vehicle was noted, despite a strong ‘‘vehicle effect’’
observed in these studies, which is a common
phenomenon in AD clinical studies that compare
active therapeutics with their emollient bases.36 For
example, vehicle-treated patients in a tacrolimus
study demonstrated therapeutic success in 19.5% of
vehicle-treated patients at 4 weeks.36 In treating

 topical drug vehicles have physiologic cutaneous
effects, adding to the drug effect in improving
outcomes
for
patients.
The
incorporation
of
crisaborole into the vehicle significantly improved
the efficacy in treating AD on a global scale and in
reducing pruritus and signs of AD.
Because of potential adverse side effects and
restricted long-term use of TCS and TCI, a safe and
efficacious topical alternative is needed to treat AD.
Crisaborole has low systemic absorption and is
quickly metabolized to its inactive metabolites,
reducing the risk of systemic side effects, making it
a promising
therapeutic alternative to existing
topical therapies.30,33 Twice-daily application of
crisaborole ointment for 28 days demonstrated a
favorable safety profile in these two phase III studies
based on: (1) low incidence of treatment-related AEs,
(2) lack of serious treatment-related AEs, and (3) low
discontinuation rates. The low incidence and mild
severity of AEs observed indicate that the novel
topical formulation of crisaborole allows for targeted
therapy at the site of inflammation while reducing
the risk of systemic side effects observed with oral
PDE4 inhibitors.22 Gastrointestinal AEs, which have
been observed with oral PDE4 inhibitors, were
reported by crisaborole-treated patients at a low
frequency (2.7%) similar to that in vehicle-treated
patients (2.4%) and were not considered treatment
related. Application site burning or stinging is a
commonly reported side effect with TCS or TCI
treatment.37 Although a direct comparison study
with TCS and TCI has yet to be performed, crisabor-
ole ointment demonstrated a low incidence of
application site pain (4.4%), defined by updated
MedDRA guidelines as stinging and/or burning,
compared with rates of application site burning
reported by tacrolimus (20%-58%) and pimecrolimus
(8%-26%).38,39 Crisaborole-treated patients did not
report cutaneous TCS AEs such as telangiectasia or
skin atrophy, but these potential risks only occur
with TCS treatment for 4 weeks or longer.40 The
favorable safety profile demonstrated in these 28-day
studies will be investigated further with a long-term
safety extension study. Overall, twice-daily applica-
tion of crisaborole ointment to all areas of the body
with the exception of the scalp for 28 days demon-
strated a favorable safety profile.
Crisaborole represents a first-in-class nonsteroidal
topical treatment that inhibits overactive PDE4 in AD
to reduce the local inflammation that drives exacer-
bations of the disease.15,24-27 The anti-inflammatory
effect on AD pathology is clear, and crisaborole also
provided early and sustained improvement in pruri-
tus in these two trials. This significant reduction in
pruritus provides additional support to the antipru-
ritic effect observed with other PDE4 inhibitors in
inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis.41 The
mechanism through which PDE4 regulates pruritus
is not well understood but is believed to be partially
an indirect result of reducing inflammation,7,42
similar to the antipruritic effects observed with TCS
treatment.42 Preclinical studies have demonstrated
that
PDE4
directly
regulates
pruritus
through
reduction of cutaneous neuron43 and dorsal root
ganglion neuron activity.7,44 Mounting evidence in-
dicates that PDE4 inhibitors directly regulate pruritus
in inflammatory skin diseases, providing early relief
for the most troublesome symptom of AD.8,45

 favorable safety profile and improvement in AD seen
in these studies. Future studies could apply alterna-
tive AD severity grading scales that may provide
additional efficacy information by anatomic region to
further our understanding and elaborate on the role
crisaborole could play in the treatment of AD. In
addition, because 45% to 60% of children develop AD
in their first 6 months to 1 year of life, respectively,1
future studies may explore the potential for crisabor-
ole treatment in patients younger than 2 years of age.
Future analysis using the Eczema Area and Severity
Index will provide valuable insight into site-specific
efficacy of crisaborole ointment for comparison with
TCS and TCI. In addition, long-term treatment is often
required because of the chronic nature of AD, and
patients in these two trials were enrolled in an
extension study to evaluate the long-term safety of
crisaborole ointment. Overall, crisaborole ointment
targets the underlying mechanism of the disease and
has the potential to effectively treat AD without the
limitations of current therapies.
We thank the study patients, investigators, and investi-
gational sites, whose participation made these studies
possible. We also thank John Quiring, PhD, of QST
Consultations Ltd, for performing the statistical analyses,
