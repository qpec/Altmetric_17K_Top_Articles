Abstract
BACKGROUND—Serum testosterone concentrations decrease as men age, but benefits of raising 
testosterone levels in older men have not been established.
METHODS—We assigned 790 men 65 years of age or older with a serum testosterone 
concentration of less than 275 ng per deciliter and symptoms suggesting hypoandrogenism to 
receive either testosterone gel or placebo gel for 1 year. Each man participated in one or more of 
three trials — the Sexual Function Trial, the Physical Function Trial, and the Vitality Trial. The 
primary outcome of each of the individual trials was also evaluated in all participants.
RESULTS—Testosterone treatment increased serum testosterone levels to the mid-normal range 
for men 19 to 40 years of age. The increase in testosterone levels was associated with significantly 
increased sexual activity, as assessed by the Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire (P<0.001), as well 
as significantly increased sexual desire and erectile function. The percentage of men who had an 
increase of at least 50 m in the 6-minute walking distance did not differ significantly between the 
two study groups in the Physical Function Trial but did differ significantly when men in all three 
trials were included (20.5% of men who received testosterone vs. 12.6% of men who received 
placebo, P=0.003). Testosterone had no significant benefit with respect to vitality, as assessed by 
the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–Fatigue scale, but men who received 
testosterone reported slightly better mood and lower severity of depressive symptoms than those 
who received placebo. The rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS—In symptomatic men 65 years of age or older, raising testosterone 
concentrations for 1 year from moderately low to the mid-normal range for men 19 to 40 years of 
age had a moderate benefit with respect to sexual function and some benefit with respect to mood 
and depressive symptoms but no benefit with respect to vitality or walking distance. The number 
of participants was too few to draw conclusions about the risks of testosterone treatment. (Funded

 Testosterone concentrations in men decrease with increasing age.1,2 Many symptoms and 
conditions similar to those that are caused by low testosterone levels in men with pituitary or 
testicular disease become more common with increasing age. Such symptoms include 
decreases in mobility, sexual function, and energy. These parallels suggest that the lower 
testosterone levels in older men may contribute to these conditions.
Previous trials of testosterone treatment in men 65 years of age or older, however, have 
yielded equivocal results. Although testosterone treatment consistently increased muscle 
mass and decreased fat mass,3,4 effects on physical performance,3,5,6 sexual function,3,6,7 
and energy3,6,8 have been inconsistent.
In 2003, an Institute of Medicine panel concluded that there was insufficient evidence that 
testosterone treatment was beneficial in older men9 and recommended a coordinated set of 
clinical trials to determine whether testosterone would benefit older men who had low 
testosterone levels for no known reason other than age and who had clinical conditions to 
which low testosterone might contribute. The Testosterone Trials were designed to 
implement that recommendation.10
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
The Testosterone Trials are a coordinated set of seven double-blind, placebo-controlled trials 
that are being conducted at 12 sites.10 To enroll in these trials overall, participants had to 
qualify for at least one of the three main trials (the Sexual Function Trial, the Physical 
Function Trial, or the Vitality Trial), but they could participate in more than one if they 
qualified. Participants were assigned to receive testosterone gel or placebo gel for 1 year. 
Efficacy was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Data on adverse events were 
collected during the treatment period and for 12 months afterward. This report describes the 
efficacy results for the three main trials and adverse events in all the participants in these 
trials.
The protocol and consent forms were approved by the institutional review boards at the 
University of Pennsylvania and each participating trial site. All participants provided written 
informed consent. A data and safety monitoring board monitored data in an unblinded 
fashion every 3 months. The protocol, consent forms, and statistical analysis plan are 
available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
The investigators developed the protocol with assistance from the National Institutes of 
Health. AbbVie, one of the funders of the trial, donated the testosterone and placebo gels but 
did not participate in the design or conduct of the trials or in the analysis, review, or 
reporting of the data before the manuscript was submitted for publication. All the authors 
participated in the design and conduct of the trials. Trial statisticians performed all data 
analyses. The first author wrote the first draft of the manuscript, and all the authors 
contributed to subsequent drafts.

 PARTICIPANTS
Participants were recruited principally through mass mailings.11 Respondents were screened 
first by telephone interview and then during two clinic visits. Eligibility criteria included an 
age of 65 years or older and serum testosterone levels that averaged less than 275 ng per 
deciliter. Exclusion criteria were a history of prostate cancer, a risk of all prostate cancer of 
more than 35% or of high-grade prostate cancer of more than 7% as determined according to 
the Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator,12 an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS; 
range, 0 to 35, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia) of more than 19, conditions known to cause hypogonadism, receipt of 
medications that alter the testosterone concentration, high cardiovascular risk (myocardial 
infarction or stroke within the previous 3 months, unstable angina, New York Heart 
Association class III or IV congestive heart failure, a systolic blood pressure >160 mm Hg, 
or a diastolic blood pressure >100 mm Hg), severe depression (defined by a score of ≥20 on 
the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ-9; range, 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating 
greater severity of depressive symptoms]), and conditions that would affect the interpretation 
of the results.
Inclusion in the Sexual Function Trial required self-reported decreased libido, a score of 20 
or less on the sexual-desire domain (range, 0 to 33, with higher scores indicating greater 
desire) of the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning in Men–II (DISF-M-II),13 and a 
partner willing to have intercourse twice a month. Inclusion in the Physical Function Trial 
required self-reported difficulty walking or climbing stairs and a gait speed of less than 1.2 
m per second on the 6-minute walk test.14 Men who were not ambulatory or who had 
disabling neuromuscular or arthritic conditions were excluded. Inclusion in the Vitality Trial 
required self-reported low vitality and a score of less than 40 on the Functional Assessment 
of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)–Fatigue scale (range, 0 to 52, with higher scores 
indicating less fatigue).15
STUDY TREATMENT
We assigned participants to testosterone or placebo by means of a minimization technique, 
with participants assigned to the study treatment that best balanced the balancing factors 
between groups with 80% probability.16,17 Balancing variables included participation in the 
main trials, trial site, screening testosterone concentration (≤200 or >200 ng per deciliter), 
age (≤75 or >75 years), use or nonuse of antidepressants, and use or nonuse of 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
The testosterone preparation was AndroGel 1% in a pump bottle (AbbVie). The initial dose 
was 5 g daily. The placebo gel was formulated to have a similar application and appearance. 
Serum testosterone concentration was measured at months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 in a central 
laboratory (Quest Clinical Trials), and the dose of testosterone gel was adjusted after each 
measurement in an attempt to keep the concentration within the normal range for young men 
(19 to 40 years of age). To maintain blinding when the dose was adjusted in a participant 
receiving testosterone, the dose was changed simultaneously in a participant receiving 
placebo.

 ASSESSMENTS
At the end of the trials, the serum concentrations of total testosterone, free testosterone, 
dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone–binding globulin were measured in serum 
samples frozen at −80°C (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Steroid 
assays were performed at the Brigham Research Assay Core Laboratory (Boston) by liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy, and free testosterone was measured by 
equilibrium dialysis. All samples from each participant were measured in the same assay 
run.
Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured and a digital rectal examination was 
performed at months 3 and 12, and PSA was measured at month 18. Detection of a prostate 
nodule or a confirmed increase in the PSA level by at least 1.0 ng per milliliter above 
baseline led to referral to the site urologist for consideration of prostate biopsy. The IPSS 
was determined at months 3 and 12. At every visit, adverse events were recorded and a 
cardiovascular-event questionnaire (see the protocol) was administered. Cardiovascular 
events were adjudicated by two cardiologists and two neurologists (see the Supplementary 
Appendix).
OUTCOMES
Efficacy outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. 
Dichotomous outcomes were used when a clinically important difference had previously 
been established. The primary efficacy outcome of each trial and the secondary outcomes of 
the Physical Function Trial were assessed in all participants; secondary outcomes for the 
other trials were assessed only in participants in those trials.
The primary outcome of the Sexual Function Trial was the change from baseline in the score 
for sexual activity (question 4) on the Psycho-sexual Daily Questionnaire (PDQ-Q4; range, 0 
to 12, with higher scores indicating a greater number of activities).10,18 Secondary outcomes 
were changes in the score on the erectile-function domain (range, 0 to 30, with higher scores 
indicating better function) of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)19 and the 
sexual-desire domain of the DISF-M-II.13 Details on the assessments in the Sexual Function 
Trial are provided in the protocol. The primary outcome of the Physical Function Trial was 
the percentage of men who increased the distance walked in the 6-minute walk test by at 
least 50 m.10,14 Secondary outcomes were the percentage of men whose score on the 
physical-function domain (PF-10; range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better 
function) of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) 
increased by at least 8 points20 and changes from baseline in the 6-minute walking distance 
and PF-10 score. The primary outcome of the Vitality Trial was the percentage of men 
whose score on the FACIT–Fatigue scale increased by at least 4 points10,15; secondary 
outcomes were the change from baseline in the FACIT–Fatigue, the score on the vitality 
scale (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more vitality) of the SF-36,21 scores on 
the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scales (range, 5 to 50 for positive affect 
and for negative affect, with higher scores indicating a greater intensity of the affect),22 and 
the PHQ-9 depression score.23 Every 3 months, participants were asked about their general

 impression of the change in sexual desire, walking ability, or energy (depending on the trial) 
and in overall health.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Participants were evaluated according to the intention-to-treat principle. Each outcome was 
prespecified. Primary analyses of outcomes at all time points were performed with random-
effects models for longitudinal data. Models included visit time as a categorical variable and 
a single main effect for treatment. For linear models of continuous outcomes, the treatment 
effect denoted the average difference in response between study groups across all four visits. 
For logistic models of binary outcomes, the treatment effect was the log odds ratio of a 
positive versus negative outcome for participants who received testosterone versus those 
who received placebo, averaged over all visits. Additional fixed effects were the baseline 
value for each outcome and balancing variables. Random intercepts were included for 
participant.
We analyzed the three trials as independent studies, without adjusting analyses of the 
primary outcomes for multiple comparisons. We also did not adjust the analyses of the 
primary and secondary outcomes within each trial for multiple comparisons, because the 
correlations among outcomes within a trial were expected to be very high, making such 
adjustment excessively conservative. Analyses of the primary outcomes that included all 
participants, however, were adjusted for multiple comparisons; we report the nominal P 
value only when it was lower than the threshold specified by the multiple-comparisons 
procedure.24 The sensitivity of results to missing data was assessed with the use of pattern-
mixture models25 and shared random-effects models.26 The effect of change in total 
testosterone level on primary outcomes was assessed with the use of instrumental variables 
by two-stage residual inclusion,27 with study-group assignment as the instrument and 
change in testosterone level from baseline as the exposure of interest.
Sample sizes were calculated such that the studies would have 90% power, with the use of a 
two-sided test at a type I error rate of 0.05,10 to detect the following differences between the 
placebo group and the testosterone group: 15% versus 30% in the proportion of men with an 
increase of at least 50 m in the 6-minute walking distance, 20% versus 35% in the 
proportion of men with an increase of at least 4 points in the FACIT–Fatigue score, and a 
difference in change of 0.75 in the PDQ-Q4 score. These differences were conservatively 
based on comparisons between baseline and 12 months. Enrollment targets were 275 men 
for the Sexual Function Trial, 366 for the Physical Function Trial, and 420 for the Vitality 
Trial.
RESULTS
PARTICIPANTS AND STUDY TREATMENT
We screened 51,085 men and enrolled 790 who met all the criteria (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).11 Relatively few men had a sufficiently low testosterone level to 
qualify; only 4700 of 21,940 men (21.4%) who had blood sampled qualified by the first

 measurement and 1490 of 2163 men (68.9%) qualified by the second, for an overall 
inclusion rate by testosterone level of 14.7%.11
At baseline, the enrollees had unequivocally low serum testosterone concentrations 
according to criteria for healthy young men (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
participants had relatively high rates of coexisting conditions: 62.9% were obese, 71.6% had 
hypertension, and 14.7% had a history of myocardial infarction (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The two study groups, however, had similar rates of these and 
other coexisting conditions; other baseline characteristics were also similar in the two 
groups.
Of the 790 men who were enrolled, 705 completed 12 months of study treatment. The 
characteristics of men who completed 12 months and those who did not complete 12 months 
did not differ appreciably (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Testosterone treatment increased the median testosterone concentration to the mid-normal 
range for young men and maintained that range during the treatment period (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). A total of 91% of men assigned to testosterone maintained a 
mean testosterone concentration above the lower limit of the normal range from month 3 
through month 12. Testosterone treatment also increased levels of free testosterone, 
estradiol, and dihydrotestosterone but did not increase levels of sex hormone–binding 
globulin (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
EFFICACY
Sexual Function Trial—Averaged over all follow-up visits, sexual activity, as determined 
by the PDQ-Q4 score, increased more with testosterone treatment than with placebo, both 
among men enrolled in the Sexual Function Trial (treatment effect [the mean difference in 
the change from baseline between participants assigned to testosterone and those assigned to 
placebo], 0.58; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A) and among all Testosterone Trials participants (treatment 
effect, 0.62; P<0.001) (Table 1). A greater increase in testosterone level during treatment 
was associated with a greater increment in the PDQ-Q4 score (P<0.001 by instrumental 
variable analysis) (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The response was somewhat 
less at month 12 (P = 0.08 for the interaction between time and treatment). Testosterone 
treatment was also associated with increased sexual desire according to the DISF-M-II 
(treatment effect, 2.93; P<0.001) and increased erectile function according to the IIEF 
(treatment effect, 2.64; P<0.001) (Table 1). Men in the testosterone group were more likely 
than those in the placebo group to report that their sexual desire had improved since the 
beginning of the trial (P<0.001) (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Physical Function Trial—Among men enrolled in the Physical Function Trial, there were 
no significant differences between the testosterone group and the placebo group in the 
percentage of men whose 6-minute walking distance increased by at least 50 m (primary 
outcome) (odds ratio, 1.42; P = 0.20) (Fig. 1B), the change from baseline in the 6-minute 
walking distance (mean difference, 4.09 m; P = 0.28) (Table 2), or the percentage of men 
whose PF-10 score increased by at least 8 points (odds ratio, 1.34; P = 0.15); there was a 
significant between-group difference in the change from baseline in the PF-10 score (mean

 difference, 2.75 points; P = 0.03) (Table 2). Among all Testosterone Trials participants, there 
was a significant between-group difference in all four measures: the percentage of men 
whose 6-minute walking distance increased by at least 50 m (odds ratio, 1.76; P = 0.003), 
the change from baseline in the 6-minute walking distance (mean difference, 6.69 m; P = 
0.007), the percentage of men whose PF-10 score increased by at least 8 points (odds ratio, 
1.50; P = 0.02), and the change from baseline in the PF-10 score (mean difference, 3.06 
points; P = 0.002). Men who received testosterone were more likely than those who received 
placebo to perceive that their walking ability had improved since the beginning of the trial (P 
= 0.002) (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Vitality Trial—Among men enrolled in the Vitality Trial, testosterone treatment showed no 
significant benefit over placebo with respect to vitality, as determined by an increase of at 
least 4 points in the FACIT–Fatigue score (primary outcome) (odds ratio, 1.23; P = 0.30) 
(Fig. 1C). However, there appeared to be a small effect on the change from baseline in the 
FACIT–Fatigue score that did not reach significance (mean difference, 1.21 points; P=0.06) 
(Table 3). In addition, a greater increase in testosterone level was associated with a greater 
increment in the score (P = 0.02 by instrumental variable analysis) (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), and the effect of testosterone on the change from baseline in the 
score in the participants in the three trials combined was significant (P = 0.006). Among 
participants in the Vitality Trial, there were significant differences between the testosterone 
group and the placebo group in the SF-36 vitality score (mean difference, 2.41 points; P = 
0.03), the PANAS positive affect score (mean difference, 0.47 points; P = 0.04), the PANAS 
negative affect score (mean difference, −0.49 points; P<0.001), and the PHQ-9 depression 
score (mean difference, −0.72 points; P = 0.004) (Table 3). The effect sizes (the mean 
between-group differences in outcome divided by the baseline standard deviations) were all 
below 0.20. The men who received testosterone were more likely than men who received 
placebo to report that their energy was better at the end of the trial (P<0.001) (Fig. S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
All Trials—Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcomes did not suggest that missing 
values affected any conclusions appreciably (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). We 
found no significant interactions of treatment with age (P values ranged from 0.45 to 0.78 in 
the three trials), body-mass index (P values ranged from 0.35 to 0.85), or race (P values 
ranged from 0.49 to 0.72).
ADVERSE EVENTS
Although more men assigned to testosterone than those assigned to placebo had an 
increment in the PSA level of 1.0 ng per milliliter or more during the treatment period (23 
vs. 8), only 1 man (in the testosterone group) received a diagnosis of prostate cancer during 
that time. Two men in the testosterone group and 1 in the placebo group received a diagnosis 
during the subsequent year (Table 4, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
change in the IPSS did not differ significantly between the two groups. A hemoglobin level 
of 17.5 g per deciliter or more was observed in 7 men in the testosterone group and none in 
the placebo group.

 Seven men in each study group were adjudicated to have had major cardiovascular events 
(myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) during the treatment 
period and two men in the testosterone group and nine men in the placebo group were 
adjudicated to have had major cardiovascular events during the subsequent year (Table 4, 
and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). There was no pattern of a difference in risk 
with respect to the other cardiovascular adverse events (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). No significant between-group differences were observed in cardiac adverse 
events defined according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities classification 
(Tables S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
DISCUSSION
Increasing the serum testosterone concentrations of men 65 years of age or older from 
moderately low to the mid-normal range for men 19 to 40 years of age had significant effects 
on all measures of sexual function and some measures of physical function, mood, and 
depressive symptoms — all to small-to-moderate degrees, consistent with the degree of 
testosterone deficiency.
Men who received testosterone reported better sexual function, including activity, desire, and 
erectile function, than those who received placebo. Although the effect sizes were low to 
moderate, men in the testosterone group were more likely than those in the placebo group to 
report that their sexual desire had improved, which suggests that this effect was of clinical 
relevance. The effect of testosterone on erectile function was less than that reported with 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.28
The percentage of men whose 6-minute walking distance increased by at least 50 m did not 
differ significantly between the two study groups in the Physical Function Trial but did differ 
significantly when men in all three trials were included, although the effect sizes did not 
differ markedly (1.42 vs. 1.76). Furthermore, men who received testosterone were more 
likely than those who received placebo to report that their walking ability was better, which 
suggests that the effect, although small in magnitude, might be clinically relevant.
Testosterone had no significant benefit with respect to vitality, as assessed by the FACIT–
Fatigue scale, except as a continuous outcome when men in all three trials were included. 
However, testosterone was associated with small but significant benefits with respect to 
mood and depressive symptoms. Men in the testosterone group were also more likely than 
those in the placebo group to report that their energy was better.
We observed four cases of prostate cancer, three of which were in men treated with 
testosterone, and there was no significant difference in urinary symptoms (as assessed by 
means of the IPSS) between the study groups. The generalizability of these results is limited, 
however, because we excluded men with a high risk of prostate cancer and men with 
moderately severe urinary tract symptoms. Furthermore, the sample size was inadequate to 
assess reliably the effect of testosterone on the risk of these conditions.

 Some studies have suggested that testosterone treatment is associated with increased 
cardiovascular risk,29–32 although others have not.6,33,34 We did not observe a pattern of 
increased risk, but this trial was too small to exclude other than a large increase.
Our three trials had certain strengths, including enrollment of men with an unequivocally 
low mean testosterone concentration, adequate sample sizes, a double-blind, placebo-
controlled design, an increase in serum testosterone concentration to the normal range for 
young men, and excellent participant retention. A major limitation, albeit an intentional one, 
is that the results apply only to men 65 years of age or older whose testosterone levels 
averaged less than 275 ng per deciliter.
Results of the primary outcomes in our three trials showed that testosterone treatment had a 
moderate, significant benefit with respect to sexual function but no significant benefit with 
respect to walking distance (among participants in the Physical Function Trial) or vitality. 
Testosterone treatment also had a significant benefit with respect to other prespecified 
outcomes, including walking distance when men in all three trials were included and mood 
and depressive symptoms. These results, together with those of the other four trials (now 
completed), should inform decisions about testosterone treatment for men 65 years of age or 
older whose levels are low for no apparent reason other than age. Such decisions will also 
require knowing the risks of testosterone treatment, which will necessitate larger and longer 
trials.

 Figure 1. Primary Outcomes in the Three Main Trials of the Testosterone Trials
The primary outcome of the Sexual Function Trial (Panel A) was the change from baseline 
in the score for sexual activity (question 4) on the Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire (PDQ-
Q4; range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more activity). The primary outcome of the 
Physical Function Trial (Panel B) was the percentage of men who had an increase of at least 
50 m in the distance walked during the 6-minute walk test. The primary outcome of the 
Vitality Trial (Panel C) was the percentage of men who had an increase of at least 4 points in 
the score on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)–Fatigue scale 
(range, 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating less fatigue). P values were calculated with the 
use of a linear random-effects model for sexual activity and logistic random-effects models 
for walking ability and vitality. The I bars represent standard deviations.

†The treatment effect is the mean difference in change from baseline for participants assigned to testosterone versus those assigned to placebo, with adjustment for balancing factors: baseline total 
testosterone level (≤200 or >200 ng per deciliter), age (≤75 or >75 years), trial site, participation in the main trials, use or nonuse of antidepressants, and use or nonuse of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
‡The effect size is the treatment effect divided by the baseline standard deviation.
§The P value for the treatment effect was determined with the use of a linear mixed model with a random effect for participant.

†The treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes is the odds ratio for achieving the outcome versus not achieving the outcome among men assigned to testosterone versus those assigned to placebo. For 
continuous outcomes, the treatment effect is the mean difference in the outcome among men assigned to testosterone versus those assigned to placebo. All analyses are adjusted for balancing factors: 
baseline total testosterone level (≤200 or >200 ng per deciliter), age (≤75 or >75 years), trial site, participation in the main trials, use or non-use of antidepressants, and use or nonuse of phosphodiesterase 
type 5 inhibitors.
‡For continuous outcomes, the effect size is the treatment effect divided by the baseline standard deviation.
§The P value for the treatment effect was determined with the use of a logistic mixed model with a random effect for participant for dichotomous outcomes and a linear mixed model with a random effect 
for participant for continuous outcomes.
¶Scores on the physical-function scale (PF-10) of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD.
†The treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes is the odds ratio for achieving the outcome versus not achieving the outcome among men assigned to testosterone versus those assigned to placebo. For 
continuous outcomes, the treatment effect is the mean difference in the outcome among men assigned to testosterone versus those assigned to placebo. All analyses are adjusted for balancing factors: 
baseline total testosterone level (≤200 or >200 ng per deciliter), age (≤75 or >75 years), trial site, participation in the main trials, use or nonuse of antidepressants, and use or nonuse of phosphodiesterase 
type 5 inhibitors.
‡For continuous outcomes, the effect size is the treatment effect divided by the baseline standard deviation.
§The P value for the treatment effect was determined with the use of a logistic mixed model with a random effect for participant for dichotomous outcomes and a linear mixed model with a random effect 
for participant for continuous outcomes.
¶Scores on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)–Fatigue scale range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating less fatigue.
||Scores on the vitality scale of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more vitality.
**Scores for positive affect and for negative affect on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scales range from 5 to 50, with higher scores indicating a greater intensity of the affect.
††Scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) depression scale range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater intensity of depressive symptoms.
‡‡The outcomes for all Testosterone Trials participants are exploratory outcomes.

*PSA denotes prostate-specific antigen.
†The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire is used to identify symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Scores range from 0 
to 35, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. A score of more than 19 indicates moderately severe lower urinary tract symptoms.
‡Data on cardiovascular adverse events were collected with the use of a specific questionnaire administered at each visit and also identified from 
the adverse-event log and the form for reporting serious adverse events (see the protocol). Myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from 
cardiovascular causes were assessed by two adjudicators.
§Other serious adverse events were defined as congenital anomaly, disability, a life-threatening event, or an event that may not be immediately life-
threatening but is clearly of major clinical significance.
