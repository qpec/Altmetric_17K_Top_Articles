Abstract: Objectives: Airports in the U.S. have gradually been transitioning to automated flight
systems. These systems generate new flight paths over populated areas. While they can improve
flight efficiency, the increased noise associated with these novel flight patterns potentially pose
serious health threats to the overflown communities. In this case study, we estimated the monetary
benefits relative to health losses associated with one significant change in flight patterns at LaGuardia
Airport, year-round use of “TNNIS Climb”, which happened in 2012 as a result of flight automation
in New York City. Prior to that, the use of the TNNIS Climb was limited to the U.S. Open tennis
matches. Methods: We developed a decision-analytic model using Markov health states to compare
the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained associated with the limited use of TNNIS
(old status quo) and the year-round use of TNNIS (current status quo). The TNNIS Climb increases
airplane noise to above 60 decibels (dB) over some of the most densely populated areas of the city.
We used this increased exposure to noise as the basis for estimating ground-level health using data
from sound monitors. The total costs (including both direct and indirect costs), QALYs, and the
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated for the limited versus the year-round
use of the TNNIS Climb. Results: The incremental lifetime costs and QALYs per person exposed
to noise associated with the limited versus the year-round use of TNNIS was $11,288, and 1.13,
respectively. Therefore, the limited use of TNNIS had an ICER of $10,006/QALY gained relative
to the year-round of TNNIS. Our analyses were robust to changes in assumptions and data inputs.
Conclusions: Despite increases in efficiency, flight automation systems without a careful assessment of
noise might generate flight paths over densely populated areas and cause serious health conditions
for the overflown communities.

1. Introduction
Despite a vast global airspace, aircrafts have historically tended to follow a predetermined pattern
that is somewhat akin to roads for automobiles [1,2]. For a long time, flights were primarily guided
by radar and radio [2]. As with other areas of transportation, however, automated flight systems
are gradually being rolled out. NextGen is one these automated systems that uses GPS, data from
other flights, and atmospheric conditions to optimize flight patterns [1–3]. NextGen has also the
potential to reduce pollution, flight time, costs, and accidents due to human error [4]. Its use, however,

has resulted in changes in flight patterns that might go over densely populated residential areas,
which pose public health threats by potentially exposing people on ground to a loud and continuous
noise [1,2]. One example of the impact of NextGen can be found in New York City, where it effectively
led to the year-round use of the otherwise restricted “TNNIS Climb” at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) since
its implementation.
The TNNIS Climb had been historically used only during the U.S. Open, a large tennis tournament
held within a park in Queens, NY, USA, that is adjacent to LGA airport. Historically, flights departing
from LGA flew over the tennis stadium in Flushing Meadows and over other sparsely populated
areas, such as the East River. However, because the roar of jet engines was loud enough to disrupt the
matches, flights were instead diverted over densely populated residential neighborhoods of Queens
(mainly Community Boards 7 and 11), NY, USA, during tennis matches. This flight, which uses runway
13 at LGA, is coded TNNIS and is known as the TNNIS Climb [5–7].
In the era of NextGen, use of runway 13 at LGA has become a common route of departure,
and TNNIS Climb has become year-round [6,8]. The trajectories of the TNNIS and the Whitestone
Climbs which are the two major departure routes of the runway 13 at LGA are provided elsewhere [9,
10]. The year-round use of TNNIS has produced large increases in aircraft noise for residential areas
of Community Boards 7 and 11 of Queens, NY, USA. These neighborhoods were previously quiet.
High levels of exposure to aircraft noise has been linked to development of serious physical and
mental health conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and anxiety [11–15]. In this paper, we
quantified the potential health and economic consequences of the year-round use of TNNIS at LGA in
Queens, NY, USA, and asked whether its benefits would outweigh the noise-associated health risks
experienced by people in what were once quiet communities.
2. Materials and Methods
We developed a simulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of limiting the year-round
use of TNNIS in Queens, NY, USA. For this purpose, we quantified the lifetime health and economic
outcomes for the two comparison arms of our study: (1) the limited use of TNNIS (old status quo);
and (2) the year-round use of TNNIS (current status quo). We measured health outcomes in terms of the
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Our study adopts a societal perspective, and thus, we modelled
both direct and indirect (productivity loss) medical costs in our main analyses. We finally measured
the incremental costs over the incremental QALYs to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(ICER) of the limited vs. the year-round use of TNNIS in Queens, NY, USA.
2.1. Impacts of the Year-Round Use of TNNIS on Noise
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey measured the average day and night levels
(DNL) of noise [16]. They specified noise contours over the affected communities of Queens, outlining
which areas were exposed to 55+, 60+, 65+, 70+, and 75+ decibels (dB) DNL [16]. Noise corridor
data showed that all year use of TNNIS has produced loud and frequent noise for people on ground,
especially persons living in the Community Boards 7 and 11 of Queens, NY, USA [5–7,16]. The Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey has created a real-time online noise tracker, through which we
verified various time point data in the existing noise corridor under the TNNIS Climb. These levels
spike during aircraft movements in Queens, NY, USA, within the Community Boards 7 and 11 [5].
This online noise tracker demonstrates that noise levels from nearby monitors can rise from below
55 dB to above 90 dB when an aircraft overflies sound monitors on ground [5]. While data from the
online noise tracker and noise estimates from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey [5,16]
might suggest a larger impact, we assumed that people living within the 60 dB DNL noise contour
would have been exposed to noise below 50 dB had not TNNIS become year-round.

2.2. Health Impacts of the Year-Round Use of TNNIS
The European’s Environmental Noise Directive has recommended 55 dB as the threshold noise
level for day, evening, and night (Lden) periods [11,17,18], whereas in the U.S. the allowable limit is
65 dB DNL [19]. A difference of 10 dB in noise makes a 65 dB ten times the intensity (power) and
two times the loudness of a 55 dB. Multiple studies have shown worst health conditions associated
with noise exposure above a 55 dB threshold [14,20,21]. While there is evidence of impacts on health
also at lower levels [22], in this study we conservatively assumed that 60 dB DNL threshold is the
line above which health problems arise. In doing so, we ensure that we: (1) are not underestimating
the health impacts, (2) are not overestimating the number of people who are impacted by the noise,
and (3) are able to line up our model inputs around more uniformly available metrics. The downside
of this approach is that we are neither exploring European standards nor U.S. standards for aircraft
noise exposure.
To identify the health impacts of aircraft noise after the year-round use TNNIS, we estimated the
number of persons in the Community Boards 7 and 11 of Queens, NY, who were living within the
60 dB DNL noise contour. The details of our estimation can be found in the Supplementary Material
(Figure S1).
Several studies have quantified how transport activities impact on ground [23,24], as well as the
potential deleterious effects of aircraft noise on both physical and mental health [25–29]. In this study,
we modeled the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (ICD-10 Chapter I) and generalized
anxiety disorder associated with aircraft noise [11–15]. Because it interferes with sleep, aircraft noise
plausibly has much broader effects on health, economic productivity, and educational outcomes among
children [11,17,18,25]. However, since we did not have adequate data, in this study we only modeled
CVD and anxiety.
We derived the relative risks of CVD (ICD-10 Chapter I) and generalized anxiety disorder
associated with aircraft noise from the literature [14,15]. Hansell et al. measured the relative risk of
CVD (ICD-10 Chapter I) associated with daytime exposure to noise as 1.14 (for >60 vs. <50 dB) [14].
In addition, Hardoy et al. showed that the aircraft noise is associated with generalized anxiety disorder
with an odds ratio of 2 [15]. While they did not further separate out the risk of anxiety associated
with different levels of noise, we assumed that their estimated odds ratio would be applicable to
our dichotomized noise exposure levels (>60 vs. <50 dB DNL). We then converted this odds ratio to
relative risk, value of which can be found in Table 1.

2.3. Economic Impacts of the Year-Round Use of TNNIS
We analyzed the Bureau of Transportation Statistics records [42] to explore the mean impact of
the year-round use of TNNIS, which began in 2012. We sought evidence of changes in utilization
and delays from LGA and John Fitzgerald Kenney (JFK) airport. We included JFK because there is
conflict between the airspace of LGA and JFK. Therefore, optimizing flights at LGA could improve
performance at JFK.
For domestic flights at LGA, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shows that the average
on-time departures dropped from 82% in 2012 to 77% in 2016. Likewise, on-time arrivals declined
from 77% in 2012 to 72% in 2016 [42]. Based on the 2016 Air Traffic Report from the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey [43], the total number of domestic and international flights at LGA and JFK
has not been changed from levels seen in 2007 [43]. Neither these documents nor documents obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request provided to us explained why delays have
increased even as the number of flights has remained constant.
While on-time status and utilization is a part of the public record [42], data on flight times are not.
A letter from the Global Gateway Alliance, an advocacy group, indicated that TNNIS reduced flight
delays and fuel consumption at JFK airport [44]. They found that, during a 5-day TNNIS Climb test
period in February 2012, the average delay time at JFK dropped from 45.7 to 25.3 min [44]. However,
they did not provide data or methods. Nor did they provide any information on real-world, long-term
impacts after implementation of NextGen. Given that real world data do not show evidence of any
improvement in utilization or delays, we used this data as a thought experiment that represents the
‘best-case’ scenario for the TNNIS Climb. We assumed all delays happen in the sky during fuel burn.
We modeled costs associated with flight delays through two components: (1) operating costs (including
fuel, labor, and other costs); and (2) productivity losses among passengers using the average number
of passengers per flight.
(1)
Operating costs
We calculated operating costs via the following formula:
Ci = DELAYi × SPEED × CASM × SEAT × FLIGHTi,
(1)
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15, 1753
5 of 13
where i represents the limited vs. the year-round use of TNNIS. DELAY, SPEED, CASM, SEAT,
and FLIGHT represents delay time, average speed of an aircraft, costs per available seat mile (including
fuel, labor, and other costs), average number of seats per flight, and average number of delayed flights
per year, respectively.
We used an average delay time of 45.7 min per delayed flight for the time that the use of TNNIS
was limited, and 25.3 min after the year-round use of TNNIS from a report [44]. The same report also
claimed that making TNNIS year-round reduced the number of delayed flights from 204 to 12 over a
5-day test period [44]. We multiplied these numbers by 73 to obtain the annual number of delayed
flights before and after the year-round use of TNNIS. While we did not find data to represent the
distribution of delays in different phases of a flight (i.e., take-off, climb, cruise, descent, and landing),
we assumed that such delays would happen during the cruise phase for the following two reasons:
(1) the cruise phase takes up the majority of a flight’s time; and (2) the assumption captures the
maximum potential savings in operating costs in favor of the year-round use of TNNIS because
of the higher average aircraft speed during the cruise phase compared to the climb and descent
phases. The average cruise speed of an aircraft was assumed to be 900 km/h [45]. The average costs
per available seat mile, and average number of seats per flight was estimated to be 11.6 cents [46],
and 176 [47], respectively. The incremental annual operating costs per person exposed to noise for the
limited relative to the year-round use of TNNIS are presented in Table 1.
(2)
Productivity losses
In addition, we calculated productivity losses using the following formula:
Pi = DELAYi × WAGE × SEAT × FLIGHTi
(2)
where i represents the limited vs. the year-round use of TNNIS, and WAGE represents the average
salary for a traveler. We got the income distribution for airline travelers across the following four
income groups: <25 K, 25 K to <50 K, 50 K to <100 K, and 100 K and above [48], and multiplied it by
the estimated mean income for each group derived from the U.S. Census Bureau [49]. The rest of the
parameters were the same as described earlier. The incremental annual productivity loss per person
exposed to noise for the limited relative to the year-round use of TNNIS is presented in Table 1.
2.4. Simulation Model
We developed a probabilistic Markov model based on CVD and anxiety as the two relevant
health effects. Pre-existing CVD has been associated with almost two-fold increase in the risk of a
subsequent CVD [14–18]. We therefore based our Markov model on three health states including “no
prior history of CVD”, “prior history of CVD”, and “death”. We also modeled onset of the generalized
anxiety disorder as an event in our analysis. The starting age of the cohort was chosen as 41 to be a
representative of our target population in Queens, NY, USA [50]. Every cohort was followed over a
lifetime using a Markov cycle length of one year.
2.5. Model Parameters
2.5.1. Background Rates and Probabilities
The background and CVD mortality rates were derived from the U.S. Life Tables [31] and a 2016
updated report from the American Heart Association [32]. In our model, participants were assigned
a background risk of developing CVD and anxiety [32,34]. In addition, increased risk of CVD and
anxiety for people with pre-existing CVD were modeled from related studies [33,35] (Table 1).
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15, 1753
6 of 13
2.5.2. Other Costs Parameters
The direct medical costs of CVD were drawn from a study by Nichols et al. [33]. Previous studies
reported on the ratio of indirect to direct costs of CVD [37,51]. We used this ratio to calculate the
indirect medical costs of CVD. In addition, direct and indirect medical costs of anxiety were derived
from a study by Greenberg [36]. All costs were adjusted to 2016 U.S. dollar (Table 1).
2.5.3. Health State Utility Values
Health utilities are scaled from 0 to 1, with 0 equals to death and 1 equals to perfect health.
We obtained values for CVD from literature [38,39]. To estimate the health utility of anxiety, we first
derived the measures for the eight subscales (i.e., bodily pain, general health, mental health, physical
functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, role limitations due to physical problems,
social functioning, and vitality) of the SF-36 (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-Item Health
Survey) that were used to derive an estimate for the health-related quality of life associated with “no to
minimal anxiety” by Brenes [52]. We then converted these values to the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) overall
score using a validated mapping algorithm by Ara and Brazier [53]. When both CVD and anxiety
happened in the same cycle, to avoid their overlapped impact on utility, we only modeled CVD-related
disutility. All the health state utility values are presented in Table 1.
2.5.4. Analysis
We ran our model based upon the base-case values for parameters (Table 1). We calculated total
direct and indirect costs as well as changes in QALYs associated with the year-round use of TNNIS as
well as its limited use. All future costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3%.
To compute uncertainty across all variables in the model, we performed a probabilistic Monte
Carlo simulation with 10,000 random draws from the probability distributions of model parameters
(Table 1). We presented our results both in terms of a cost-effectiveness plane and a cost-effectiveness
acceptability curve. The latter indicates the probability of cost-effectiveness of the limited vs. the
year-round use of TNNIS at different willingness-to-pay (WTP) values. WTP is the maximum price
that policy makers are willing to pay in order to gain one QALY [54]. Our simulation model was
constructed in TreeAge Pro 2017 (TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA) [55].
In addition, to evaluate the robustness of the model outcomes against changes in core parameters
including all direct medical costs, productivity losses, all rates and probabilities, utility values,
and discount rate, we performed a large number of one-way sensitivity analyses.
Finally, because the allowable noise limit in the U.S. is 65 dB DNL [19], we conducted a scenario
analysis in which we limited our target population to those exposed to noise above 65 dB DNL after
the year-round use of TNNIS. In this scenario, we assumed that health conditions associated with noise
would only occur upon exposure to noise above 65 dB DNL. Details of our estimation for number
of people living within the 65 dB DNL noise contour can be found in the Supplementary Material
(Figure S2). We investigated the cost-effectiveness outcomes of the limited vs. the year-round of TNNIS
in this scenario analysis.
3. Results
3.1. Base Case Results
Table 2 presents the expected lifetime model outcomes per person exposed to noise for both
the limited and the year-round use of TNNIS arms. We showed that the limited use of TNNIS was
associated with more societal costs and QALYs compared to its year-round use. On average the
incremental lifetime costs, and QALYs associated with the limited use of TNNIS, for an average person
exposed to noise, was estimated to be $11,288, and 1.13, respectively. This resulted in an ICER of
$10,006/QALY. Therefore, despite possible benefits of the year-round of TNNIS in terms of decreasing
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15, 1753
7 of 13
operating costs and productivity losses, the ICER of the limited vs. the year-round use of TNNIS fell
below $50,000/QALY as a commonly used threshold for the cost-effectiveness analysis [56].

3.2. Probabilistic Results
Figure 1 indicates the results of the probabilistic analyses in a cost-effectiveness plane. In 25% of
the simulation runs, the limited use of the TNNIS Climb seen before 2012 was shown to be cost-saving,
meaning that it would save both money and health. In addition, in 60% of the simulation runs,
the ICER of the limited vs. the year-round use of TNNIS fell below $100,000/QALY.

Airport (LGA) in New York City.
Figure 2 represents the results of the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. At the WTP threshold
value of $0/QALY, there was a 25% chance that the limited use of TNNIS would become cost-effective
relative to the year-round use of TNNIS. This probability was estimated to be 75%, and 85%, at the
WTP threshold value of $50,000/QALY, and $100,000/QALY, respectively.

3.3. One-Way Sensitivity Analysis
One-way sensitivity analyses indicate the robustness of the overall ICER in response to changes
in core input parameters of the model. The most influential input parameter of our model was the
relative rate of anxiety associated with aircraft noise. If there were no statistical association between
anxiety and noise (relative rate = 1), the ICER of the limited vs. the year-round use of TNNIS would
be increased to $208,107/QALY. In contrast, if the relative rate of anxiety due to noise exposure (>60
vs. <50 dB DNL) were increased to 3.06, the limited use of TNNIS would become a cost-saving
option compared to the year-round use of TNNIS. The impact of changes in other input parameters of
our sensitivity analyses was small and the ICER of the limited versus the year-round use of TNNIS
remained below $100,000/QALY. The details of these analyses can be found in Table 3.
3.4. Scenario Analysis
We ran a scenario in which we increased the noise threshold above which health conditions arise
from 60 dB to 65 dB. Accordingly, we estimated the number of persons of Community Boards 7 and
11 of Queens, NY, who were living within the 65 dB DNL noise contour due to the year-round use
of TNNIS. Under this scenario, the limited use of the TNNIS Climb was associated with additional
$78,288 costs and 1.13 QALYs, which resulted in an ICER of $69,401/QALY gained that still falls below
the recommended 50K or 100K thresholds for cost-effectiveness [54].

4. Conclusions
Flight pattern optimization can, in theory, produce profound societal benefits. These include
reduced atmospheric pollution, gains in productivity from reduced flight time, and increases in the
timely delivery of products and services. NextGen is a recently implemented automated system at
airports that optimizes flight patterns in the sky and improves flight efficiency. Airports are one of
the primary points of commercial activities, and optimizing flight patterns can have positive spillover
effects on the economy. However, it can also have negative impacts on health, resulting in unintentional
harm and unforeseen costs. This, in turn, also produces negative spillover effects.
In this study, we examined the potential health and economic impacts of a change in one flight
route, TNNIS Climb, in NY. This route was originally used only during U.S. Open tennis tournament,
but has become year-round since NextGen was implemented in 2012. We found that the ICER of the
limited use of TNNIS (old status quo) would be $10,006/QALY gained compared to its year-round use
(current status quo). This suggests that, based on a subset of health and economic endpoints that was
modelled in this study, it is likely that limiting the use of TNNIS would be cost-effective relative to its
year-round use. Doing so would prevent much more disease at a much lower cost than commonly
used clinical health prevention modalities, such as colon cancer screening or mammography [54].
Because we found that limiting the use of TNNIS would result in an ICER below the recommended
WTP threshold values for cost-effectiveness [56], we did not attempt to add further cost savings from
productivity or other spillover effects for people on ground, such as future lost tax revenue, social
service consumption, and crime costs associated with lower educational attainment [57]. Future studies
that focus on less densely populated sound corridors with smaller airports may show fewer health costs,
and may therefore need to account for some of these other important health and economic endpoints.
This provides a segue into the limitations of our study. First, our study focuses on the increased
use of one flight route that might have been influenced by the implementation of NextGen in one
location. It does not speak about the broader trade-offs produced by NextGen in other locations as
we deem critically important to explore impacts locally on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, our model
is available on demand to the research community so that it can be modified for nearly any local
context. Second, it is challenging to estimate the exact noise exposure associated with overflights on
ground. We used sound corridor data from the Port Authority and real-time sound data. While the
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15, 1753
10 of 13
real-time observations of sound monitors show sounds in excess of 90 dB when an aircraft overflies
the residential areas of Community Boards 7 and 11 of Queens, NY, we did not have continuous sound
monitor data. We assumed that the noise exposure would have dropped to levels around or below
the baseline 50 dB for people living within the 60 dB DNL noise contour had not TNNIS been used
year-round. Also, the real-time system we used shows the size of the aircraft, but generally does not
show all aircrafts in the area. Third, we only modeled CVD and anxiety as health consequences of
noise even though there are a wider array of potential health and economic endpoints of aircraft noise.
Our model is similar to a previously published cost-effectiveness model exploring the health impacts
of aircraft noise [58], and we were not able to incorporate other studies of noise and health [26–29].
This is because the use of other studies would require that we make broader assumptions surrounding
the dose-response relationship between noise and other types of health endpoints. As such, our results
solely rely on the applicability and generalizability of the previous findings by Hansell et al. [14],
in association of noise and CVD, and Hardoy et al. [15], in association of noise and anxiety, to the
setting of our study. Fourth, Hardoy et al. provided an overall estimation for risk of anxiety due to
aircraft noise with no specification for noise levels [15]. In this study, we assumed that the relative risk
of developing anxiety as reported by Hardoy et al. would be applicable to our dichotomized noise
exposure levels (>60 vs. <50 dB DNL), and that we assumed noise below 50 dB DNL would not be
harmful for health. This has some support from literature, as studies have shown 55 dB DNL is the
threshold at which health problems would arise [11,14,17,18,20,21]. To account for such uncertainty, in
our sensitivity analyses, we used a wide range of error in our measure of association of anxiety and
the noise categories of our model. Finally, efficiencies are associated with fewer emissions and air
pollution. However, there is little information on how varying flight patterns over urban areas impacts
particulate concentration on ground, and this potentially important benefit of the year-round use of
TNNIS was not included.
Our study explores the cost-effectiveness of one air route in one city that insists over an unusually
densely populated area. Though our estimates of health impacts were informed from published
studies, it is very difficult to fully account for the broader economic impacts of the year-round use
of TNNIS. Our study should by no means be taken as a blanket assessment of changes to flight
patterns that might reduce airline fuel consumption, increase productivity, and reduce global warming.
However, they point to the strong need for careful study of public health impacts of such changes
before they are implemented. NextGen holds great potential for improving our lives. However,
it also appears to produce an increase in disability and death, at least in New York City. Most people
have some experience with unpleasant noise in their environment (be it sirens, honking, or aircraft),
yet remarkably little is known about it or is done about it. We hope that models such as ours can be
used to better understand the trade-offs that new technologies bring.
