Mechanism of human rhinovirus infections
Dieter Blaas2 and Renate Fuchs1*
Abstract
About 150 human rhinovirus serotypes are responsible for more than 50 % of recurrent upper respiratory infections.
Despite having similar 3D structures, some bind members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, some ICAM-1,
and some use CDHR3 for host cell infection. This is also reflected in the pathways exploited for cellular entry. We found
that even rhinovirus serotypes binding the same receptor can travel along different endocytic pathways and release
their RNA genome into the cytosol at different locations. How this may account for distinct immune responses elicited
by various rhinoviruses and the observed symptoms of the common cold is briefly discussed.

Introduction
Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) account for more than 50 %
of upper respiratory tract infections. The disease is known
as the common cold that usually resolves within 5–7 days.
Symptoms include nasal stuffiness, sneezing, coughing,
and a sore throat but about 12–32 % of HRV infections in
children of less than 4 years are asymptomatic [1]. Treat-
ment is so far only palliative as no vaccination and ap-
proved antivirals are available; because of the usually
annoying but uncomplicated course of the disease, only
drugs without side effects will be accepted by otherwise
healthy patients. However, rhinovirus infections on top of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma,
or cystic fibrosis (CF) might become life-threatening in-
creasing the demand for the development of such antivi-
rals [2].
Pre-school children can experience an upper respiratory
infection up to 8 to 12 times per year (reviewed in [3]) that
might lead to wheezing, otitis media, bronchiolitis, exacer-
bations of asthma, CF, or COPD and aggravate allergic
reactions. The newly discovered RV-C species is thought to
account for a significant proportion of HRV-related illness,
especially in infants [4].
The nasal epithelium
The main site of RV infections is the nasal mucosa. The
nasal cavity is lined by a pseudostratified epithelium
composed of columnar, ciliated epithelial cells, mucous-
secreting goblet cells, and basal cells [5]; lymphocytes, mast
cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages migrate to and then
home in the epithelium under pathologic conditions. The
epithelium is anchored in the underlying extracellular
matrix that contains vascular endothelial cells and sub-
mucosal glands. The luminal, ciliary surface of the airways
is covered by periciliary liquid and a mucus layer trapping
inhaled particles such as bacteria and viruses. Mucus
produced by the glands and goblet cells contains water, ions
(e.g., Na+, Cl−, and K+), glycoproteins, and immunoglobu-
lins such as IgG and polymeric IgA (pIgA) [6]. Beating cilia
transport the mucus layer together with adhering particles
to the oral cavity where it is swallowed; digestion then leads
to destruction of the infectious agent. Mucociliary clearance
requires a balance between ciliary beat, volume, and com-
position of mucus and periciliary fluid. This balance is
perturbed in chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as
CF and COPD. In CF, mucus composition, viscosity, and
pH (a mean of 6.57 versus 7.18 in controls) are altered, ren-
dering the airways more susceptible to infections [7].
HRV receptors, entry, and replication
HRVs are non-enveloped with a ss(+)RNA genome that is
protected by an icosahedral protein capsid built of 60
copies each of the four viral proteins VP1–VP4 [1]. Based
on phylogeny, more than 150 HRV types are classified as
species A, B, and C [8]. Twelve HRV-A (the minor group)
bind members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor
(LDLR) family whereas the remaining A and B types
(the major group) bind intercellular adhesion molecule-

 1 (ICAM-1) [9, 10]; for HRV-C, the recently identified
CDHR3 might serve as a receptor [11]. The mechanisms
of entry and uncoating of HRV-C are unknown; we will
thus limit the discussion to HRV-A and B.
For infection, the cognate receptor must be accessible to
the virus, i.e., at the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells.
While reports on the location of ICAM-1 in the healthy
nasal mucosa are contradictory, it is generally agreed that
this receptor is upregulated upon inflammation [12]. Re-
investigating this issue, we detected ICAM-1 at the ciliated
surface of all nasal epithelial cells in the nasal tissue from
healthy individuals (Ellinger et al., to be published). As
expected from its “normal” physiologic function, LDLR is
located at the basolateral plasma membrane of the polar-
ized airway, intestinal, renal, and hepatic cell lines. We were
thus surprised to find that LDLR and LDLR-related protein
1 (LRP-1) are present at the apical side of the nasal epithe-
lial cells and thus available for uptake of virus at its main
port of entry (Ellinger et al., to be published).
HRVs of species A and B investigated so far enter cells
by receptor-mediated endocytosis [13]. In the endosomal
lumen, they convert into subviral A (altered) particles
devoid of the innermost capsid protein VP4 but still con-
taining the RNA genome. After the release of the RNA
(uncoating) into the cytoplasm, empty capsids remain
(Fig. 1). Minor group HRVs exclusively depend on the low
endosomal pH for this conformational modification and
uncoating occurs even at 20 °C [13, 14]. Although uncoat-
ing of HRV-A2 is receptor-independent, the ß-propeller of
LDLR and LRP plays a role in releasing the virus in early
endosomes thus enabling its transport to late endosomes
(pH ≤ 5.6), a station most suitable for RNA transfer into

Fig. 1 HRV entry and uncoating in ciliated nasal epithelial cells. Left, HRV-A2; middle, HRV-A89; and right, HRV-B14. For clarity, minor group and major group
receptors (LDLR and ICAM-1, respectively) are depicted separately although they are co-expressed at the ciliated (apical) side of nasal epithelial cells as well
as on the entire plasma membrane of basal cells. After binding to the respective receptor at the ciliated surface, the viruses are internalized and delivered
into early endosomes. For HRV-A2, the mildly acidic pH in these compartments leads to dissociation of the virus from its receptor. While LDLR is returned
to the apical plasma membrane via perinuclear recycling endosomes, the virus is directed to late endosomes. The low pH ≤ 5.6 in late endosomes converts
native viruses into subviral A particles. Subsequently, the viral RNA is released and the remaining empty capsids (subviral B particles) are shuttled to and
degraded in lysosomes. In contrast, HRV-A89 together with ICAM-1 is sorted into the recycling pathway. Perinuclear recycling endosomes are similarly
acidic as late endosomes resulting in conversion of native HRV-A89 into A and then into B particles. After the transfer of the viral RNA into the cytoplasm,
empty capsids are most likely returned to the apical mucous layer. After binding to the same receptor, HRV-B14 is routed from early endosomes into the
pathway to lysosomes. However, after undergoing the ICAM-1-dependent conformational modification, the virus ruptures the endosomal membrane
leading to RNA uncoating and its penetration into the cytoplasm. Thus, the viral capsid as well as the viral RNA escapes lysosomal degradation. So far, the
fate of ICAM-1 is unknown

 the cytosol [13]. On the other hand, it is generally accepted
that conversion of ICAM-1 binding HRVs into A particles
is facilitated by the receptor above 26 °C [15]; in addition,
depending on the serotype, the process also requires low
endosomal pH [16]. However, major group HRV-A89 can
also convert at 20 °C in a low pH-dependent but presum-
ably receptor-independent manner and, even more import-
antly, it follows a route different from the one taken by
HRV-B14 (Conzemius et al., manuscript submitted). While
HRV-A89 productively uncoats in the perinuclear recycling
compartment, HRV-B14 penetrates into the cytoplasm by
rupturing endosomes en route to the lysosomes in a
temperature- (≥20 °C), low-pH, and ICAM-1-dependent
manner (Fig. 1). Whether this is related to different affinity
of ICAM-1 for the respective virus—and associated differ-
ences in dissociation of the virus-receptor complex—is cur-
rently under investigation.
Once the RNA has arrived in the cytoplasm, it is trans-
lated into a polyprotein. After autocatalytic cleavage into
the structural (capsid) and non-structural proteins, the
RNA is replicated by the viral polymerase. Finally, infec-
tious progeny is assembled and released into the nasal cav-
ity [1]. In contrast to HRV infection in tissue culture cells,
airway epithelial cells of patients are not lysed for virus
release; as shown for other enteroviruses, it is thus possible
that cell-to-cell spread might occur via virus-carrying
microvesicles [17].
Host response to HRV infections
Although initially believed that HRV infection was limited
to the upper airways, replicating virus was found in ciliated
epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract. Infected cells
appear in patches, and only 10 % of the ciliated cells
produce viral proteins and RNA [18]. Similar results had
been obtained with in situ hybridization in nasal biopsies,
again indicating that only a small proportion of cells were
infected [19]. Nevertheless, basal cells are more susceptible
to infection as compared to fully differentiated ciliated cells
[20]. This might be related to the higher expression level of
ICAM-1 in basal cells versus ciliated cells (Fuchs, unpub-
lished observations). The absence of visible cytopathic alter-
ations in the airway epithelium led to the hypothesis that
the symptoms are rather due to the immune response of
the host [21]. Upon HRV entry into and replication in cili-
ated epithelial cells, signalling pathways are activated lead-
ing to the release of various cytokines (IL-1ß, TNF, IL-8, IL-
6, IL-11), chemokines (Rantes, MCP-1, MP-10), vasoactive
peptides (bradykinin), and growth factors (VFGF) [21].
Consequently, inflammatory cells (leukocytes, granulocytes,
monocytes) become activated and invade the submucosa.
This results in amplification of the inflammatory process
and the typical symptoms of the common cold. Conversely,
HRV infections are controlled by innate and adaptive im-
mune responses. Type-I interferons are the early mediators
of the innate immune system, while neutralizing IgA and
IgG in serum and secretions are observed 1–2 weeks after
infection as a consequence of the adaptive immune re-
sponse. Nasal epithelial cells express the pIgA receptor
(pIgR) and the neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn) that transport
the respective immunoglobulins into nasal secretions
[22]. Expression of FcRn in the ciliated epithelial cells
and in dendritic cells (DC) in the nasal mucosa might
contribute to mucosal immunity as shown for FcRn in
the intestine [23].
How could the entry pathway taken by a given rhinovirus
impact on the immune response? We presented evidence
for HRV-A2 transferring its genome into the cytosol via a
pore in the membrane and the remaining empty capsid
being directed towards lysosomes where it is degraded. On
the other hand, HRV-B14 breaks the endosomal membrane
resulting in arrival of viral proteins in the cytoplasm [13].
As a consequence, one might hypothesize that the proteins
of incoming virus are presented to the immune system
either as products of proteasomal (HRV-B14) or lysosomal
(HRV-A2) processing. Degradation products of the former
would thus be mainly presented by the MHC-I system and
the latter mainly by the MHC-II system. Furthermore,
pattern recognition receptors in the endosome are different
from those in the cytosol [1]. Such differences might impact
on differences in the primary immune response; neverthe-
less, in the absence of further experimentation, this remains
pure speculation.
Summary and conclusions
HRVs are a major cause of respiratory infections of infants.
The numerous serotypes are precluding the development
of a vaccine, and current treatments only palliate the symp-
toms. HRVs enter from the apical side of the cells lining the
airways by receptor-mediated endocytosis via LDLR and
ICAM-1. We demonstrated that all nasal epithelial cells ex-
press ICAM-1 and LDLR at their ciliated side and that two
ICAM-1 binding HRV types exhibit different temperature
dependence of uncoating and take distinct routes inside the
cell for genome release (Fig. 1). This may explain why
different HRVs elicit different signals during cell entry
resulting in different host responses to infection [24, 25].
Understanding the details of receptor binding, entry, and
uncoating is crucial for identifying novel means of fighting
the common cold.
