Abstract
Background: The gut microbiome has an important role in infant health and immune development and may be
affected by early-life exposures. Maternal diet may influence the infant gut microbiome through vertical transfer of
maternal microbes to infants during vaginal delivery and breastfeeding. We aimed to examine the association of
maternal diet during pregnancy with the infant gut microbiome 6 weeks post-delivery in mother-infant dyads
enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Infant stool samples were collected from 145 infants, and
maternal prenatal diet was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. We used targeted sequencing of the
16S rRNA V4-V5 hypervariable region to characterize infant gut microbiota. To account for differences in baseline
and trajectories of infant gut microbial profiles, we stratified analyses by delivery mode.
Results: We identified three infant gut microbiome clusters, characterized by increased abundance of Bifidobacterium,
Streptococcus and Clostridium, and Bacteroides, respectively, overall and in the vaginally delivered infant stratum. In the
analyses stratified to infants born vaginally and adjusted for other potential confounders, maternal fruit intake was
associated with infant gut microbial community structure (PERMANOVA, p < 0.05). In multinomial logistic regression
analyses, increased fruit intake was associated with an increased odds of belonging to the high Streptococcus/
Clostridium group among infants born vaginally (OR (95% CI) = 2.73 (1.36, 5.46)). In infants delivered by Cesarean
section, we identified three clusters that differed slightly from vaginally delivered infants, which were characterized
by a high abundance of Bifidobacterium, high Clostridium and low Streptococcus and Ruminococcus genera, and high
abundance of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Maternal dairy intake was associated with an increased odds of infants
belonging to the high Clostridium cluster in infants born by Cesarean section (OR (95% CI) = 2.36 (1.05, 5.30)). Linear
models suggested additional associations between maternal diet and infant intestinal microbes in both delivery
mode strata.
Conclusions: Our data indicate that maternal diet influences the infant gut microbiome and that these effects differ by
delivery mode.

 Background
Studies have examined the maternal contribution to
infant health, including the effect of maternal diet during
pregnancy and lactation. Prenatal diet influences the risk
of infant and child allergy. For instance, the Mediterra-
nean diet during pregnancy has been associated with a
reduced risk of both persistent and atopic wheeze and
atopy in children at 6.5 years old [1, 2]. High meat
consumption during pregnancy is associated with an
increased risk of wheeze in the first year of life, while
maternal dairy intake is associated with a reduced risk of
infantile wheeze [2]. Little is known about the actual
mechanisms by which maternal diet affects children’s
health; we hypothesize that maternal diet impacts the
development of the gut microbiome in infancy and
subsequently influences child health outcomes. It is
established that diet is an important driver of the gut
microbiome. Short-term diets comprised solely of either
plant or animal foods have been shown to alter the
human gut microbiome [3]. In addition, studies in
humans and humanized gnotobiotic mice show that
diets with reduced carbohydrates [4], or high in polysac-
charides, alter gut microbiome composition [5].
To date, there has been limited investigation of the
relation of maternal diet with the developing infant gut
microbiome. One study observed that maternal high-fat
diet during pregnancy was associated with meconium
microbial composition but had limited maternal diet
data [6]. One mechanism the infant gut microbiome
may be affected by maternal diet is via vertical transfer
of maternal microbes to infants at delivery. There is a
well-established relation of the infant gut microbiome
with delivery mode (Cesarean section versus vaginally
born infants) [7, 8] which may persist through adulthood
[9]. Alternatively, maternal diet may affect fetal develop-
ment and subsequent host response to microbial popula-
tions at and after birth. Additionally, differences in
breast milk composition due to maternal diet may
contribute to the infant gut microbiome in breastfed
infants. We examined the relationship of maternal diet
during pregnancy with the infant stool microbiome in
6-week-old infants and identified associations within
delivery mode groups.
Results
Study population
Characteristics of the study population are summarized
in Table 1 (n = 145). Maternal age ranged from 22 to
44 years, with an average of 31.9 years. More than 70%
of mothers in the population had at least a college
degree, more than 90% were married, and most were
first-time mothers. Smoking during pregnancy was rare
at 4.8%, and the population was slightly overweight with
an average pre-pregnancy BMI of 25.6. Our population
had more male infants than female infants (57.2%
males), and an average birth weight and gestational age
of 3427 g and 39.3 weeks, respectively. Most infants
were born vaginally (66.9%) and were exclusively breast-
fed (70.3%) at 6 weeks of age. Daycare attendance and
infant antibiotic exposure at or before 4 months of age
were rare. Measures and distributions of maternal pre-
natal diet are shown in Table 1. Most subject character-
istics and maternal dietary factors were not different
between delivery mode groups (Table 1).
Microbial community composition and maternal dietary
factors
We identified 11,029,093 bacterial sequences in 145
6-week infant stool samples passing quality control. The
most abundant taxonomic group was Enterobacteriaceae
comprising 20.0% of the 6-week infant stool micro-
biome, followed by Bifidobacterium (18.4%), Bacteroides
(10.4%), and Streptococcus (8.10%) (Additional file 1:
Table S1). Open-reference OTU picking identified a total
of 4260 OTUs in our population of 6-week infant stool
samples, with 2850 OTUs corresponding to Greengenes
IDs and 1410 de novo OTUs. Our main analyses focused
on vaginally delivered infants (n = 97). Adjusting for
infant feeding method, maternal BMI, parity, and batch,
maternal fruit consumption was associated with infant
stool
microbiome
composition
(generalized
UniFrac
distance PERMANOVA, p = 0.028; Table 2; Fig. 1a). In a
sensitivity analysis, the effect of maternal fruit consump-
tion on the infant gut microbiome in babies born
vaginally persisted when restricted to infants who were
exclusively breastfed (generalized UniFrac distance PER-
MANOVA, p = 0.022; Table 2). Excluding infants who
may have received antibiotics, or those delivered prema-
turely (Additional file 1: Table S10, Figure S7a), did not
qualitatively change the results.
Infant gut microbiome clusters
We identified three distinct clusters of the infant gut
microbiome in vaginally delivered infants (n = 97), with
cluster 1 characterized by a high abundance of the genus
Bifidobacterium, cluster 2 by the genera Streptococcus
and Clostridium, and cluster 3 by the genus Bacteroides
(Additional file 1: Figure S1, Table S1). To assess the
relationship between maternal dietary factors and infant
gut cluster membership, we used multinomial logistic
regression with cluster 1 as the reference group. The
odds of belonging to cluster 2 are 2.73 times greater for
each additional maternal serving of fruit per day (95% CI
1.36, 5.46; Table 3, Fig. 1b). These results were consistent
when infants delivered prematurely were not included in
the analyses (Additional file 1: Table S9, Figure S6a).

 Operational taxonomic units in the infant gut and
maternal dietary factors
To investigate the microbial taxa that may drive differences
observed above, we measured associations between each
maternal dietary factor and the relative abundance of indi-
vidual infant stool operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
with linear models adjusted for feeding method, maternal
BMI, parity, and batch. While the microbiome-wide signifi-
cance of maternal dietary factors after adjusting p values
using the false discovery rate (FDR) method was not
observed, OTUs with the same taxonomic assignment
tended to appear together in the most significant results,
supporting a true association of maternal dietary factors
and infant gut microbiota. Maternal aMED score was
positively associated with OTUs classified to the family
Enterobacteriaceae, the genus Streptococcus, and the family
Clostridiaceae, and negatively with OTUs classified to the
species Bacteroides uniformis, the Enterobacteriaceae fam-
ily, and the species Escherichia coli and [Ruminococcus]
gnavus (Fig. 1c; Additional file 1: Table S2a). Maternal dairy
intake was positively associated with OTUs classified to the
species Clostridium neonatale and C. butyricum and the
genus Staphylococcus, and negatively related to OTUs
classified to the Lachnospiraceae family (Additional file 1:
Table S2b). OTUs classified to the genus Streptococcus
including the species Streptococcus agalactiae were posi-
tively associated with maternal fish and seafood intake,
while OTUs classified to the species Bacteroides uniformis
were negatively associated (Additional file 1: Table S2c).
We observed a negative association between fruit intake
and OTUs of the genus Bifidobacterium and a positive
association with OTUs in the Clostridiaceae family in the
infant gut (Additional file 1: Table S2d). We observed
additional associations between these and other maternal
dietary factors and infant stool OTUs, which are presented
in the supplementary tables.
Associations in infants delivered by Cesarean section
We separately assessed the relation of maternal diet with
the infant gut microbiome in infants delivered by Cesarean
section (n = 48). In an adjusted analysis, maternal dairy
intake
was
associated
with
infant
stool
microbiome
composition (generalized UniFrac distance PERMANOVA,
p = 0.034; Fig. 2a; Additional file 1: Table S3). Additionally,
we identified clusters of infant gut microbiota in infants
delivered by Cesarean section that differed slightly from
those identified in vaginally delivered infants; cluster 1 was
characterized by a high abundance of the genus Bifidobac-
terium, cluster 2 by high Clostridium and low Streptococcus
and Ruminococcus genera, and cluster 3 by high abun-
dances of the family Enterobacteriaceae, the genus Rumino-
coccus, and the family Lachnospiraceae (Additional file 1:
Table S1, Figure S1). The odds of belonging to the cluster 2
were 2.36 times greater for each additional maternal serving
of dairy per day (95% CI 1.05, 5.30; Fig. 2b; Additional file 1:
Table S4). Linear models indicated a positive association of
maternal dairy intake with OTUs classified to the family
Enterobacteriaceae and the species Escherichia coli and
negative association with the OTUs that belong to the
genera Bifidobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides
(Additional file 1: Table S5b). One OTU classified to the
genus Corynebacterium was negatively associated with

 maternal dairy intake (p = 0.0044), and one each OTU
classified to the species Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae (p =
0.0040) and to the family Ruminococcaceae (p = 0.0061),
respectively, were also positively associated with maternal
dairy intake, but we did not observe multiple related OTUs
with similar associations. OTUs classified to the genus
Enterococcus (one q value < 0.10) and the Lachnospiraceae
family were positively related with and OTUs classified to
the family Enterobacteriaceae, the species Escherichia coli
and the genera Streptococcus and Blautia, were negatively
related with the maternal aMED score (Additional file 1:
Table S5a). As in vaginally delivered infants, maternal fish
and seafood intake was positively associated with OTUs in
the genus Streptococcus in infants delivered by Cesarean
section (Additional file 1: Table S5c). In contrast to
infants born vaginally, maternal dietary fish and seafood
were positively associated with OTUs in the genus
Bacteroides including the species B. uniformis and
negatively associated with OTUs in the species Clos-
tridium neonatale and other OTUs of the Streptococcus
genus (Additional file 1: Table S5c). Additionally, ma-
ternal red and processed meat was positively associated

 Discussion
We observed differences in both overall infant gut
microbial community structure and specific microbes in
relation to maternal dietary factors, often in a delivery
mode-dependent pattern. Some effects of maternal diet
were more apparent in exclusively breastfed infants; how-
ever, we were unable to compare to exclusively formula-fed
infants since most infants received some breast milk.
We found maternal fish and seafood consumption to be
positively related to OTUs in the genus Streptococcus in
the infant gut, which included the species Streptococcus
agalactiae, or Group B Streptococcus. Streptococcus aga-
lactiae is known to infect farmed fish populations [10],
and
fishmongers
have
presented
with
infections
of
Streptococcus iniae related to fish handling [11]. Fish con-
sumption is generally recommended as healthful due to
its DHA and EPA content despite the exposure to heavy
metals and other contaminants that may be detrimental to
health [12]. For instance, greater fish consumption is asso-
ciated with child development outcomes including de-
creased risk of asthma and improved cognition [13, 14].
The decrease in OTUs classified to the species Clostrid-
ium neonatale with increased maternal fish and seafood
intake in infants born by Cesarean section is a possibly
beneficial change to infant intestinal microbial communi-
ties. We observed consistent associations between mater-
nal DHA and EPA intake and infant gut microbiota. The
associations of other maternal dietary factors with specific
infant gut microbes were also somewhat unexpected,
namely for red and processed meat and for fruit consump-
tion. While fruit is considered healthful and red and proc-
essed meat consumption is recommended to be limited,
OTUs in the genus Bifidobacterium, generally recognized
as a beneficial microbe, were decreased with increasing
maternal fruit consumption in vaginally born infants yet
increased with higher maternal red and processed meat
consumption in those born by Cesarean section. The re-
sults from infant gut microbiome cluster analyses are con-
sistent with this observation. For example, it is surprising
that higher maternal fruit intake is associated with an in-
creased probability of an infant delivered vaginally belong-
ing to cluster 2, in which the genera Bifidobacterium and
Bacteroides are underrepresented and the family Clostri-
diaceae is overrepresented compared to the other two
clusters.
The effect of maternal dairy intake on infant gut micro-
biota was primarily observed in infants delivered by
Cesarean section. Infants delivered by Cesarean section
are at increased risk of dairy allergies compared to those
born vaginally [15, 16] and show decreased colonization
of milk-digesting bacteria [7, 17] including the genus
Lactobacillus. One recent study suggests that both the
microbial and fatty acid composition of breast milk may
differ by delivery mode [18], so the differential effect of
maternal dairy intake by delivery mode on the infant gut
microbiome may be attributable to the differences in
breast milk microbiota or lipids in relation to maternal
diet by delivery mode. Our observation of increased
colonization with the species Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae,
a microbe that colonizes and promotes growth in plants
[19], with maternal dairy in the Cesarean group is interest-
ing in conjunction with the positive associations found
between maternal dairy and the species Clostridium
neonatale and Staphylococcus genus in vaginally delivered
infants. Species of the genus Acinetobacter are increasingly
involved in nosocomial infections [20], while the species
Clostridium neonatale was initially isolated from infants
affected by necrotizing enterocolitis [21], and the patho-
genic potential of species in the genus Staphylococcus is
well-established [22, 23]. Thus, it will be important to
investigate whether maternal dairy consumption fosters
the growth of potentially pathogenic microbes in the
infant gut, particularly for infants delivered operatively.
In several cases, a maternal dietary factor was associated
with a microbe in both delivery groups but in opposite
directions. Since Cesarean delivery results in differential
microbial community structure of the infant gut [24], and
the gut microbiome is a complex system, such differences
are plausible; experimental studies will be required to con-
firm this observation. However, the associations between
maternal diet and infant gut microbial communities did
not always differ by delivery mode. For example, the
maternal aMED score was consistently positively and
negatively associated with the Enterobacteriaceae family,
and additionally negatively associated with the species
Escherichia coli, in both delivery mode strata.

 Our study sample was drawn from Northern New
England, which has a relatively homogenous population;
this could limit the generalizability of the study. However,
by limiting unmeasured confounding due to differences in
human microbiomes between populations that may result
in erroneous associations with dietary differences, our
study also may have greater internal validity. Maternal diet
was assessed by self-report between 24 and 28 weeks of
gestation, and it is possible that dietary patterns change
near the end of pregnancy or during lactation. However,
diets are often stable, and a mid-pregnancy food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ)-assessment is likely to be sufficiently
representative of late pregnancy and lactation diet in a
high proportion of individuals [25, 26]. Nonetheless, the
effects we observe may be due in part to maternal diet
during lactation. Further, we cannot conclude if the effects
of maternal diet occur only in breastfed babies, or also in
those mostly fed formula, or a combination of formula
and breast milk. It is also possible that associations
between maternal exposures and infant microbiota at
6 weeks of life are influenced by factors not investigated in
this study.
Future studies examining the relationship between
maternal diet and components of breast milk including
microbial and nutritional profiles, as well as the potential
influence of maternal diet on the fetal microbiome, may
offer insight into the mechanisms by which maternal diet
influences the infant gut microbiome. Determining the

 impact of changes in the gut microbiome of infants due to
maternal diet on infant health and development is an
opportunity to refine dietary recommendations for preg-
nant and lactating women to support infant health.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we identified three clusters of infant gut
microbial communities and observed effects of multiple
maternal prenatal dietary factors on the infant gut micro-
biome that often varied by delivery mode.
Methods
Study population
Subjects for the present study were from the New
Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS) who provided
infant stool samples at 6-week postpartum. As described
previously [27, 28], eligible participants for the NHBCS
are pregnant women obtaining prenatal care in New
Hampshire, US clinics, who reported relying on a
private, unregulated well as their home water source.
Participants between 18 and 45 years old were recruited
between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. The Center for
the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth pro-
vided institutional review board approval. All methods
were carried out in accordance with the guidelines.
Written informed consent was obtained for participation
from all subjects for themselves and their children.
Between 31 March 2011 when the first potential subject
with the opportunity to collect a 6-week infant stool
sample from was screened for eligibility and 30 June
2015 when the data were frozen for this analysis, 6569
women were screened for eligibility and 1334 were
eligible. Nine hundred seventy-six subjects were enrolled
and 361 provided 6-week infant stool samples, 187 of
which had 16S rRNA gene sequencing data available
(Additional file 1: Figure S2).
Telephone interviews conducted every 4 months ascer-
tained the infant’s feeding method, including the timing of
breastfeeding cessation and the start date of each new
formula, as applicable, as well as medication use such as
antibiotics. Infants reported to have never been introduced
to formula and to be breastfed were considered to be exclu-
sively breastfed, while those who were ever breastfed and
ever formula-fed were considered to be fed with a combin-
ation of breast milk and formula regardless of whether or
not the infant was still breastfed at the time of stool collec-
tion. Those who were never breastfed and only received
formula were considered exclusively formula-fed. The deliv-
ery mode was drawn from maternal delivery records, and
maternal pre-pregnancy height, weight, and parity were
determined via a self-administered questionnaire upon
study entry and used to compute pre-pregnancy BMI.
Maternal dietary data and Mediterranean diet score
Maternal diet during pregnancy was assessed during
gestational weeks 24–28 with a validated food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) [25]. We computed the alternative
Mediterranean diet (aMED) score based on FFQ-derived
measures of daily food intake, following the method of
Tobias et al. 2012 [29], excluding alcohol consumption to
adapt the score to a pregnant cohort. Daily consumption
of vegetables, fruits, legumes, soy, and nuts, whole grains,
fish and seafood, and monounsaturated to saturated fat ra-
tio (MUFA:SFA) above the median is considered healthful
and confers 1 point to the aMED score. Red and proc-
essed meat intake is considered less healthful, and con-
sumption below the median confers 1 point to the aMED
score. This results in possible aMED score values from 0
to 7, with a higher score indicating greater adherence to a
Mediterranean dietary pattern. We additionally considered
each of those dietary components and maternal dairy,
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and omega-3 fatty
acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA) intakes separately.
Sample collection and DNA extraction
Infant stool samples were collected at the 6-week maternal
postpartum follow-up appointment and were aliquoted and
frozen at − 80 °C within 24 h. Following established
methods reviewed by Wu et al. [30], we used the Zymo
DNA extraction kit (Zymo Research) to extract microbial
DNA from thawed samples and quantified the DNA using
OD260/280 nanodrop.
Targeted 16S rRNA gene sequencing
The V4-V5 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA
gene was sequenced at the Marine Biological Laboratory
(MBL) in Woods Hole, MA, using established methods
[31, 32]. As described previously [24], 16S rDNA V4-V5
amplicons were generated from purified genomic DNA
samples using fusion primers. The use of forward primers
containing one of eight five-nucleotide barcodes between
the
Illumina-specific
bridge
and
sequencing
primer
regions and the 16S-specific region and a single reverse
primer containing 1 of 12 Illumina indices enables 96
samples per lane multiplexing. Amplifications were done
in triplicate with one negative control for internal quality
control at the MBL. We used qPCR (Kapa Biosystems) to
quantify the amplicon pool, and one Illumina MiSeq
500 cycle paired-end run to sequence each pool of 96
libraries. We demultiplexed and divided datasets using
Illumina MiSeq Reporter and a custom Python script.
Microbiome profiling
To identify microbial population structure profiles, we
used full-length amplicon sequences for the rRNA gene
V4-V5 hypervariable regions. We merged the forward and
Lundgren et al. Microbiome  (2018) 6:109 
Page 8 of 11
 reverse reads based on sequence overlap [33], removed
the primer sequences, and discarded the sequences
containing any ambiguous nucleotides. We used vsearch
[34] to remove chimeras both de novo and in comparison
to the RDP classifier training reference.
Data processing and statistical analysis
We identified open reference operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) using QIIME version 1.9.1 [35] with the UCLUST
algorithm and 97% similarity [36]. We used PyNAST
alignment [37] with Greengenes core reference [38, 39] to
build OTU tables and assign taxonomy [39, 40]. Phylogen-
etic trees were constructed using the FastTree method
[41]. Subsequent analyses were performed using R version
3.2.2 [42]. We computed generalized UniFrac distances
between pairs of samples using OTU tables and the
midpoint rooted phylogenetic tree. Generalized UniFrac
unifies weighted and unweighted UniFrac to detect
differences in moderately abundant lineages instead of
those exclusively in highly abundant or rare lineages [43,
44]. Of 187 infant stool samples with available sequencing
data, we dropped 18 for missing maternal FFQ data, 14
for missing infant feeding method, and 7 for missing
maternal BMI. We dropped three samples of low quality,
with read counts < 5000, yielding a final sample size of
145 (Additional file 1: Figure S2), with 97 vaginally deliv-
ered infants and 48 delivered by Cesarean section.
Primary analyses were of vaginally delivered infants. We
tested the contribution of maternal dietary measures (as
continuous variables) to the infant microbiome at 6 weeks
using the adonis function in the R package vegan [45] with
10,000 permutations. This is a nonparametric permuta-
tional multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)
test that partitions a distance matrix by sources of
variation and can accept both categorical and continuous
variables. In preliminary analyses of all infants, delivery
mode, feeding method, as previously shown in our cohort
[24], and parity were significantly related to infant stool
microbial community composition at 6 weeks of age. We
performed crude and adjusted analyses for each dietary
food group variable individually, normalized by maternal
calorie consumption, and maternal aMED score and
MUFA:SFA ratio in vaginally delivered infants. All dietary
variables were modeled as continuous variables. Adjusted
analyses included both variables known to be related to
the infant gut microbiome by previous studies and
variables significantly related to infant gut microbiota in
our population to control confounding. Accordingly, we
adjusted
for
feeding
method
(exclusively
breastfed,
combination fed, exclusively formula fed), maternal BMI
(continuous),
parity
(continuous),
and
batch
and
performed a sensitivity analysis in exclusively breastfed
infants. We considered p < 0.05 to be significant. To
visualize the results, we performed principal coordinates
analysis (PCoA) on generalized UniFrac distances using
the cmdscale function in R [42] and plotted the samples
by the first two coordinates, colored by each dietary
variable tertile to aid in visualization.
Inspired by the work identifying adult enterotypes by
Arumugam et al. [46] and Wu et al. [47], we identified
clusters of the infant gut microbiome at 6 weeks of age
using the partitioning around medoids (PAM) method of
clustering on generalized UniFrac distances. We identified
clusters in all infants (n = 145) and within infants delivered
vaginally (n = 97) or by Cesarean section (n = 48) for
within delivery group analyses. We used the elbow
method to determine the optimal number of clusters,
which is based on the within-cluster sum of squares. To
assess the relationship between each maternal dietary
factor and infant gut microbiome cluster membership, we
used multinomial logistic regression in the R package nnet
adjusting all models for the same covariates as in previous
analyses. The outcome in each model was the infant gut
microbiome cluster membership; cluster 1 was used as the
reference in all models.
To more precisely identify which microbial taxa
contribute to the observed differences in infant stool
microbial community composition by maternal dietary
factors, we used a series of linear models to test the
relationships between each maternal dietary factor and
each OTU. We computed the relative abundance for
each OTU by dividing the read count in each cell by
the total number of reads in the sample and filtered out
OTUs with zero or near-zero variance using the caret
package in R. This results in 624 OTUs. We used a zero
replacement procedure and log-ratio transformation to
account for the zero-inflated and compositional nature
of the data [48] before running linear models. We
adjusted p values for multiple comparisons using the
Benjamini and Hochberg method to control the false
discovery rate [49]. In reporting the results, we use the
lowest level of assigned taxonomy available, which is
most commonly the genus, but ranges from the family
to the species level.
All
analyses
were
analogously
performed
in
the
Cesarean section group to assess if an effect of maternal
diet on the infant gut microbiome exists in the case of
surgical delivery. We were unable to adjust for antibiotic
usage due to a paucity of exposure and imprecise data
on timing of exposure. For sensitivity, we repeated
analyses (1) excluding infants with possible antibiotic ex-
posure (nvaginal = 3, nCesarean = 2) and those with missing
antibiotic exposure information (nvaginal = 3, nCesarean = 2)
and (2) excluding all infants delivered before 37 weeks
gestation (n = 8), reported in the supplemental informa-
tion. We also report unadjusted estimates for analyses
and analyses further adjusted for infant age at sample
collection in the supplemental information.
