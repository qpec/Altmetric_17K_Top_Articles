Abstract
Background: Cancer immunotherapy has been firmly established as a standard of care for patients with advanced
and metastatic melanoma. Therapeutic outcomes in clinical trials have resulted in the approval of 11 new drugs
and/or combination regimens for patients with melanoma. However, prospective data to support evidence-based
clinical decisions with respect to the optimal schedule and sequencing of immunotherapy and targeted agents,
how best to manage emerging toxicities and when to stop treatment are not yet available.
Methods: To address this knowledge gap, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Melanoma Task Force
developed a process for consensus recommendations for physicians treating patients with melanoma integrating
evidence-based data, where available, with best expert consensus opinion. The initial consensus statement was
published in 2013, and version 2.0 of this report is an update based on a recent meeting of the Task Force and
extensive subsequent discussions on new agents, contemporary peer-reviewed literature and emerging clinical
data. The Academy of Medicine (formerly Institute of Medicine) clinical practice guidelines were used as a basis for
consensus development with an updated literature search for important studies published between 1992 and 2017
and supplemented, as appropriate, by recommendations from Task Force participants.
Results: The Task Force considered patients with stage II-IV melanoma and here provide consensus
recommendations for how they would incorporate the many immunotherapy options into clinical pathways for
patients with cutaneous melanoma.
Conclusion: These clinical guidleines provide physicians and healthcare providers with consensus
recommendations for managing melanoma patients electing treatment with tumor immunotherapy.

 Background
Cutaneous melanoma continues to be a serious public
health threat with a slow, but steady increase in annual
incidence over the past four decades [1]. In 2017, there
were an estimated 87,110 new cases and 9730 deaths
due to melanoma in the United States. While melano-
mas detected early can often be treated by complete sur-
gical excision with good outcomes, the development of
metastatic disease, which is associated with reduced sur-
vival, is correlated with increasing stage and other
high-risk features of the primary tumor [2]. Contempor-
ary systemic therapeutic options for patients with meta-
static
melanoma
include
cytotoxic
chemotherapy,
molecularly targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Since
2011, the treatment landscape for patients with melan-
oma has changed considerably with regulatory approval
of 11 new drugs and/or combination regimens [3]. Im-
munotherapy agents in particular have been associated
with durable long-term survival in responding patients
and have emerged as first-line treatment in most melan-
oma populations [4].
The immunotherapy agents approved for melanoma
include cytokines, such as interferon α2b/pegylated
interferon
α2b
for
high-risk
adjuvant
therapy
and
high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) for metastatic disease; ipi-
limumab and nivolumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors
targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)
and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), respectively for
high-risk adjuvant melanoma, and four T cell checkpoint
inhibitors for metastatic melanoma, including ipilimu-
mab (anti-CTLA-4), pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1), nivolu-
mab (anti-PD-1) and the combination of ipilimumab/
nivolumab; finally, one gene-modified oncolytic virus,
talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), has been approved
for intralesional therapy [5–12]. While the clinical trials
supporting regulatory approvals have dramatically chan-
ged the melanoma treatment landscape and provided pa-
tients and providers with several new options, there is
relatively little data for evidence-based decisions in re-
gard to optimal sequencing of these agents, methods or
biomarkers to select the right treatment for individual
patients, or rigorous information on how best to manage
potential adverse events or indicators for optimal dur-
ation of therapy. The availability of other therapeutic op-
tions, in particular targeted therapy for patients whose
melanoma harbors a mutation in BRAF, highlight the
importance of having data or consensus agreement from
experts in the field on how best to manage patients
while waiting for new clinical and clinical trial data to
help inform decision-making.
To address the gap in evidence-based data, the Society
for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) established a Mel-
anoma Task Force to provide consensus recommenda-
tions for clinical decision making for patients with
melanoma.
SITC
is
a
non-profit
professional
organization dedicated to improving cancer patient out-
comes through the use of cancer immunotherapy. The
Task Force consisted of melanoma experts, including
physicians, nurses and patient advocates who met in per-
son and communicated through email to consider major
issues and provide recommendations related to patient
selection, toxicity management, treatment cessation and
treatment sequencing. The panel published the first con-
sensus statement in 2013 [4], and this publication repre-
sents an update based on more recent assessment of the
peer-reviewed literature and clinical experience of the
expert Task Force participants. These recommendations
are not intended to supplant sound clinical judgment
but to provide clinicians who care for melanoma pa-
tients the most current thinking on how experts inte-
grate
immunotherapy
into
the
treatment
armamentarium for patients with advanced cutaneous
melanoma.
Methods
Consensus statement policy
SITC
utilized
the
National
Academy
of
Medicine
(formerly Institute of Medicine) March 2011 Standards
for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Guidelines as a
model for organizing and preparing this consensus state-
ment [13]. These standards include a transparent process
for guideline development and funding, managing and
reporting conflicts of interest, maintaining a multidiscip-
linary and balanced group composition, establishing an
evidence-based foundation for recommendations and rat-
ing system to assess the strength of the evidence, report-
ing the results through a peer-reviewed publication and
publicly available website, and updating the statement as
changes in the field warrant revisions.
The Melanoma Task Force was established through
SITC in 2011, with additional panel members added as
necessary (Additional file 1). A Steering Committee led a
panel discussion to develop clinical treatment guidelines
considering four basic issues for each immunotherapy
agent in current clinical practice: patient selection, toxicity
management, assessment of response, and therapy se-
quencing and combinations. The in-person meeting was
supplemented by email voting on several issues due to the
rapid development of new findings and drug approvals for
melanoma over the last 2 years. Full consensus recom-
mendations can be found on the SITC website [14].
Owing to disparities in drug approval and availability in
some countries, this panel focused solely on drugs ap-
proved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
An advance copy of this manuscript was submitted to the
FDA for comment before submission for publication. The
panel also recognized that the AJCC Cancer Staging Man-
ual, 8th Edition has been released but the clinical trial data
Sullivan et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2018) 6:44 
Page 2 of 23
 reviewed utilized earlier versions of AJCC staging; as such,
the recommendations presented in this manuscript were
largely based on 7th edition staging criteria. However, rec-
ommendations that extrapolate clinical trial data using
7th edition staging criteria in the setting of completion
lymph node dissection (CLND), are made to the current
era using the 8th edition staging system in the non-CLND
era where appropriate.
Consensus panel and conflicts of interest
Potential panel members were solicited from the SITC
membership and supplemented with non-member mel-
anoma multidisciplinary experts, clinicians and groups
in the U.S. expected to be affected by the development
of any recommendations, including patients, patient ad-
vocates and nurses. Panel members were screened for
conflicts of interest using the SITC disclosure form,
which mandates full financial and other disclosures in-
cluding
relationships
with
commercial
entities
that
might reasonably be expected to have direct regulatory
or commercial impact resulting from the publication of
this statement. Disclosures of potential conflicts of inter-
est are noted in this manuscript. No commercial funding
was used to support the consensus panel, literature re-
view or preparation of the manuscript.
The consensus panel convened in June 2016 in accord-
ance with the National Academy of Medicine and SITC
guidelines to review results from a previously distributed
questionnaire collecting information on the participants’
role in the care of patients with melanoma, primary clin-
ical focus, experience with FDA-approved agents used
for immunotherapy treatments, and current practices in
the use or recommendation for use of such agents. Add-
itional
questionnaires
were
distributed
electronically
after the meeting to collect further information, includ-
ing a final questionnaire in the late summer of 2017.
The final consensus statement was made available to the
entire SITC membership for open comment and these
comments were considered for the final manuscript and
are available in supplementary materials (see Add-
itional file 2) and online at the SITC website [14].
Literature review and rating system
A search of the scientific literature (using the MEDLINE
database) was conducted focusing on current therapeutic
approaches in humans. The search terms included “mel-
anoma” and “interferon”, “interleukin-2”, “ipilimumab”,
“vemurafenib,” “BRAF,” “dabrafenib, dacarbazine, temozo-
lomide”, “pembrolizumab”, “nivolumab”, “PD-1/PD-L1”,
“combination”,
“talimogene
laherparepvec”,
“adverse
event”, and “toxicity”. The search resulted in retrieval of
nearly 2400 manuscripts, which were screened by Task
Force members to include only papers with clinically rele-
vant
information
and
removing
duplicates
from
independent searches, resulting in a final bibliography of
1643 manuscripts (see Additional file 3) catalogued using
EndNote X5.0.1. The bibliography was supplemented with
additional literature identified by the panel, as appropriate.
Literature was graded into three levels of evidence, as pre-
viously described [4]. Level A evidence is based on strong
supporting evidence, such as data derived from appropri-
ately powered prospective, randomized clinical trials or
meta-analyses; Level B is based on moderate supporting
data, such as uncontrolled, prospective clinical trials; and
Level C is based on weaker supporting data, such as retro-
spective reviews and case reports.
Consensus recommendations
The Task Force considered individual melanoma stages
independently and provided the following consensus rec-
ommendations described by stage of disease. These rec-
ommendations were based on data available for AJCC
version 7 staging guidelines; where appropriate, modifi-
cations relevant for AJCC version 8, which became ac-
tive in January 2018, are noted. The majority of the
immunotherapy trials on which the following recom-
mendations are based included patients with ECOG Per-
formance Status 0 or 1. These guidelines are intended to
assist clinicians in critical decision-making for patients
with melanoma and should not supplant clinical judg-
ment for individual patient management.
Immunotherapy for stage II melanoma
Initial assessment
Patients with stage II melanoma have an excellent over-
all survival (OS) of 80% or better provided the primary
tumor is completely excised [2]. A subset of tumors,
characterized as deep (Breslow thickness > 4 mm), and/
or with ulceration, and possibly those with a high tumor
mitotic rate (≥1 per mm2), are considered at higher risk
for recurrence [15]. Practically speaking, using both
AJCC 7th and 8th additions, Stage IIB and IIC are con-
sidered higher risk. The panel discussed at length the
changing landscape with respect to how to define high
risk and when to consider further intervention with the
goal of preventing tumor relapse. There was unanimous
agreement that all stage II patients should have a com-
prehensive diagnostic workup and be reviewed by a
multidisciplinary team, including physicians with expert-
ise in surgical oncology, medical oncology, dermatology
and dermatopathology to accurately determine tumor
stage and estimate the risk of melanoma recurrence for
individual patients. This workup should include sentinel
lymph node biopsy information, as appropriate [16].
Consensus management of stage II melanoma
The panel considered the therapeutic approach to stage
II melanoma should be based on an assessment of risk
Sullivan et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2018) 6:44 
Page 3 of 23
 for tumor recurrence or metastatic spread but recog-
nized that there is considerable controversy in how to
determine risk stratification. Further, changes in the
AJCC staging system and emerging data using a variety
of histologic and molecular assays for risk assessment
have made firm recommendations challenging. For the
purposes of our discussions, we defined high risk stage
II as patients with tumors > 4 mm in depth (with or
without ulceration) or tumors > 2–4 mm with ulcer-
ation. While this definition may change with further
prospective data, the general approach to patient man-
agement can be considered based on clinical assessment
of higher versus lower risk.
There was general agreement that patients with lower
risk stage I and IIA melanoma can be observed and that
there is no evidence that currently warrants treatment of
these patients (Fig. 1). The panel, however, was divided
on
the
role
of
immunotherapy
for
patients
with
higher-risk stage IIB-C melanoma (see Fig. 1) and recog-
nized the limited Level A data available to inform clin-
ical decision-making. The panel did consider emerging
Level B data suggesting new recommendations are
needed
for
high-risk
stage
II
melanoma
patients.
Whereas before the majority of the panel recommended
that high-risk patients be treated with standard 1-year
high dose interferon-α2b, now a small majority (55%)
recommend enrollment onto a clinical trial - either un-
selected or selected by a biomarker known to be associ-
ated with either risk (prognostic) or responsiveness to
the therapy (predictive) - as a preferred option for these
patients. Among panel members who did not recom-
mend a clinical trial, twice as many recommended ob-
servation (20%) as did the pursuit of standard of care
adjuvant interferon α-2b (10%). This is a reflection of a
number of factors including: 1) improved systemic ther-
apy for recurrent, metastatic disease [4]; 2) acknowledg-
ment of the limitations of the AJCC staging system to
identify those at high and low risk of recurrence (e.g., a
significant number of patients with low risk [by cur-
rently available methods] melanoma will still die of dis-
ease
[15]);
and
3)
emerging,
as
yet
non-validated
biomarkers, which may better identify patients at great-
est risk of recurrence (e.g., ulceration, gene expression
profile, circulating tumor DNA) [15, 17, 18]. None of the
panel members recommended treatment with pegylated
interferon-α2b for patients with stage II disease.
Patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma who are

interferon-α2b
should

a
good
Fig. 1 Stage II melanoma immunotherapy treatment algorithm. All treatment options shown may be appropriate, and final selection of therapy
should be individualized based on patient eligibility and treatment availability at the physician’s discretion. These algorithms represent consensus
sequencing suggestions by the panel. (1) High-risk disease is defined as tumors > 4 mm in depth (with or without ulceration) or > 2–4 mm with
ulceration. There is limited consensus on adjuvant therapy for this group with 10% of the panel recommending interferon-α2b, 20% recommending
observation, 45 and 15% recommending therapeutic and/or biomarker-based clinical trial participation, respectively, and no panelists recommending
pegylated-interferon-α2. (2) There is no evidence that immunotherapy is useful in patients with lower risk stage II melanoma, although the panel did
recommend clinical trial participation, if available. Protocol-specific eligibility would need to be followed to select appropriate study candidates. (3)
Patients should have a good performance status without evidence of significant depression, psychiatric history or underlying autoimmune disease to
be considered for interferon-α2b. There are limited data available on interferon-α2b as treatment for stage II disease. (4) Clinical trials were the
preferred treatment recommendation for patients with stage II disease associated with higher risk of tumor recurrence

 performance status without evidence of significant de-
pression or psychiatric history or underlying auto-
immune disease [4]. The data to support the use of
adjuvant, high-dose interferon-α2b are controversial and
many studies did not incorporate required sentinel
lymph node biopsy into the study eligibility complicating
the interpretation. In a prospective study, 499 patients
with melanoma Breslow thickness > 1.5 mm, and without
clinically detectable lymph node metastases, were ran-
domly
assigned
to
18
months
of
subcutaneous
interferon-α2b or observation [19]. Patients treated with
interferon-α2b demonstrated a significant improvement
in relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.038) and a trend to-
ward improved OS (P = 0.059). In another trial, 855 pa-
tients were randomly assigned to observation or 4 weeks
induction interferon-α2b followed by 1 or 2 years of
interferon-α2b maintenance therapy [20]. The study in-
vestigators reported an improvement in RFS for patients
who received 1 year of maintenance interferon-α2b (haz-
ard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 0.63–
0.96; P = 0.034), but no benefit in OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI:
0.74–1.10; P = 0.642). Several other prospective random-
ized trials examined interferon-α2b at a variety of doses
and treatment schedules in patients with stage II melan-
oma, but none has demonstrated a survival benefit [5,
21–25]. A recently reported phase 3 randomized study
in 1150 patients with resectable melanoma (T2bN0,
T3a-bN0, T4a-bN0, and T1-4N1a-2a) who were ran-
domly assigned to receive intravenous (IV) high-dose
interferon-α2b for 5 days every week for 4 weeks or ob-
servation, produced equivalent 5-year RFS rates between
groups. Moreover, 4 weeks of IV interferon-α2b resulted
in higher rates of treatment-related grade 3 and higher
toxicities (57.9% vs. 4.6%; P < .001) and worsened quality
of life [26]. These studies are complicated by a lack of a
standardized definition of ‘high risk for relapse’
, 23 dif-
ferent
interferon-α2b
dosages/formulations/schedules
were evaluated, and in some cases, the inclusion of other
drugs in combination. Thus, the efficacy of interferon in
sentinel node negative stage II melanoma patients re-
mains unresolved. To date, there are no data with ipili-
mumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or BRAF-targeted
therapy (either single-agent BRAF inhibitors or com-
bined BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy) to justify the use of
these agents/regimens in patients with stage II melan-
oma. However, data from planned clinical trials may pro-
vide additional information to guide the use of the
anti-PD1 agent pembrolizumab in this setting.
Immunotherapy for stage III melanoma
Stage III comprises a heterogeneous group of patients
with 5-year survival rates ranging from 30 to 80% [15].
While the previous consensus statement considered stage
III patients as a single group, the Task Force strongly
believed that, in patients with microscopic metastasis to a
single lymph node (stage N1a), especially when the node
has been excised by sentinel lymphadenectomy, cancer be-
haves differently than in patients with more extensive
lymph node involvement (stages N1b-3). In the updated
recommendations, patients with N1a disease, in accord-
ance with the AJCC 7th edition were considered as a dis-
tinct subset; management recommendations by nodal
staging are shown in Fig. 2. With the recent publication
and adoption of the 8th edition of AJCC, which strived to
identify a group of Stage III patients with significantly
lower risk, the Task Force considered Stage IIIA (per AJJC
8th Ed.) to have lower risk of tumor recurrence compared
to Stage IIIB-D. The management of stage III disease has
also been complicated by recent data showing that, while
immediate completion lymph node dissection was associ-
ated with a decreased rate of lymph node basin recurrence
and
increased
disease-free
survival
in
sentinel
node-positive patients, there was no improvement in
melanoma-specific survival [27]. These findings along
with the availability of more effective systemic treatment
will change the management for sentinel node-positive pa-
tients, although all of the reported clinical trials of adju-
vant therapy mandated completion lymph node dissection
as a key eligibility criterion for study participation. Thus,
the recommendations for stage III management should be
considered carefully in light of these recent developments.
Initial assessment
In all patients with stage lll melanoma, a diagnostic workup
should be performed and reviewed by a multidisciplinary
team for patient and tumor characteristics. Complete
tumor staging information should be assessed, including
pathological features of the primary tumor and any in-
volved lymph nodes, as well as BRAF mutation testing. In
addition, whole-body imaging (see Table 1) and perform-
ance status assessment should be completed prior to mak-
ing treatment decisions. Nodal status should be determined
based on physical examination and sentinel lymph node bi-
opsy (SNB) with or without subsequent completion lymph-
adenectomy if SNB is positive. The consensus panel
identified five potential immunotherapy agents with poten-
tial clinical benefit in the adjuvant therapy of patients with
stage
III
melanoma:
interferon-α2b,
pegylated
interferon-α2b, ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolu-
mab [6, 28–31]. Furthermore, the consensus panel noted
that the combination of the BRAF and MEK inhibitors,
dabrafenib and trametinib, respectively, was recently shown
to be superior to placebo in patients with stage III melan-
oma with BRAF V600E/K mutations; these data provide
the first evidence for significant RFS and OS benefit of a
targeted antitumor therapy that does not fit the putative
immunotherapy approach and can be considered for pa-
tients with tumors harboring BRAF mutations [32].

 Consensus management of microscopic single node disease
(stage N1a – AJCC 7th; stage IIIA – AJCC 8th)
The majority of the panel (70%) recognized that
patients with microscopically involved lymph nodes
(N1a disease) represents a different population from
those with macroscopic nodal disease (N1b and N2–
N3 disease) and agreed that the AJCC 8th edition
takes this into account by redefining Stage IIIA as be-
ing associated with a lower risk than in the AJCC 7th
edition. However, whereas the majority (52%) of the
former panel in 2014 recommended a standard 1-year
course of interferon-α2b for adjuvant therapy of pa-
tients with microscopic nodal disease, only a small
number recommended this therapy in this update. Ra-
ther, the majority of the panel (58%) recommended a
clinical trial, 10% recommended observation, 5% ipili-
mumab (10 mg/kg), and 10% adjuvant interferon-α2b,
if a clinical trial was not available. No panelists recom-
mend pegylated interferon-α2b or ipilimumab given at
3 mg/kg (see Fig. 2).
There is one prospective randomized clinical trial dem-
onstrating a benefit in RFS for patients with microscopic
nodal disease treated with pegylated interferon-α2b [6]. A
post-hoc analysis of that trial also suggested patients with
ulcerated primary tumors might derive more clinical
benefit from pegylated interferon-α2b [33]. In this ana-
lysis, patients with ulceration of their primary melanoma
(n = 849) were compared to patients without ulceration of
their primary melanoma (n = 1336), and patients with ul-
ceration demonstrated a significant improvement in RFS
(P = 0.02), distant metastasis-free survival (P < 0.001) and
OS (P < 0.001). The analysis also found that the greatest
reduction in risk was seen in patients with ulcerated pri-
mary melanomas who were classified as stage IIb–IIIN1,
demonstrating a HR of 0.58 for OS benefit (P < 0.0001)
[34]. Thus, patients with ulcerated primary tumors and
those with microscopic nodal disease could consider pegy-
lated interferon-α2b based on this Level B data, although
further evaluation of this regimen is ongoing in an
EORTC trial.
Fig. 2 Stage III N1a (7th)/Stage IIIA (8th) melanoma immunotherapy treatment algorithm. The consensus of the panel was to separate Stage III
N1a (based on AJCC 7th edition) and Stage IIIA (AJCC 8th) from other Stage III subsets based on lower risk of metastatic potential. However, a
minority (30%) felt that all Stage III patients should be treated similarly. All treatment options shown may be appropriate and final selection of
therapy should be individualized based on patient eligibility and treatment availability at the physician’s discretion. These algorithms represent
consensus sequencing suggestions by the panel. (1) There are limited data on the role of adjuvant therapy following sentinel lymphadenectomy
alone, which is anticipated to become more common. (2) There is Level A evidence to support the use the combination of dabrafenib and
trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E/K mutant, Stage III melanoma independent of the volume of lymph node involvement or the number of
lymph nodes involved. (3) Level A data supporting the use of nivolumab over ipilimumab was demonstrated in patients with Stage IIIB to IV
resected melanoma and did not include patients with Stage IIIA (based on 7th) disease. Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg dosing was supported by a
minority of panelists (10%), however, subset analysis suggests that the risk: benefit ratio for patients with Stage IIIA melanoma does not support
its use in Stage IIIA patients at this time. (4) There are level A data that 1 year interferon-α2b is associated with improvement in RFS and, while
this therapy was generally recommended by the consensus panel previously, only two panelists recommended considering this therapy. There
are level B data to support a benefit in RFS for pegylated-interferon-α2b in patients with N1a disease and in patients with ulceration of the
primary tumor site; however, no panelists considered this a reasonable option for these patients. Abbreviations: LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;

 Ipilimumab has been studied in patients with stage III
melanoma in a prospective clinical trial (EORTC 18071),
which randomized 951 patients to either placebo or ipili-
mumab, given at 10 mg/kg induction (4 doses every
3 weeks) followed by maintenance (every 12 weeks for
up to 3 years) [30]. With a median follow up of over
5 years, ipilimumab was associated with improved RFS
compared to patients treated with placebo (median 27.6
vs. 17.1 months, HR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.64–0.89; P = 0.0008)
and OS (5-year 65% vs. 54%, HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.58–
0.88; P = 0.001). However, in subgroup analysis, patients
with stage IIIA disease, despite being required to have
one or more nodal metastases at least 1 mm in size, had
no evidence of benefit (HR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.46–2.09)
[30]. Thus, there was hesitation in considering adjuvant
ipilimumab for patients with lower risk, stage III disease
in light of known toxicity, although adjuvant ipilimumab
was recommended by a minority of the panel (10%).
In an older trial, which included patients with com-
pletely resected stage IV or high-risk stage III melanoma,
adjuvant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating fac-
tor (GM-CSF) did not demonstrate improvements in RFS
Table 1 Clinical Issues in Tumor Immunotherapy for Cutaneous Melanoma
Clinical Issue
Current Consensus Recommendations
Biomarker Status
• The panel recognized the importance of identifying predictive
biomarkers to aid in clinical decision-making
• At present there are no validated biomarkers that reliably predict
response to individual therapeutic agents
• There is considerable interest in PD-L1 expression, mutation burden,
lymphocyte infiltration, interferon-γ and related cytokine gene signatures
as potential biomarkers
• There are data suggesting higher response rates to monotherapy, but not
combination therapy, with T cell checkpoint inhibitors when PD-L1 expression
is increased but the panel does not recommend PD-L1 status be used outside
of clinical trials
Laboratory Assessment
• Immunotherapy is associated with significant irAEs that require laboratory
monitoring before and during active treatment
• Clinicians should be alert for irAEs during therapy and for several months
after stopping treatment
• All panelists agreed that baseline and routine labs should include complete
blood count, liver enzymes, metabolic panel, serum LDH and thyroid function
studies (free T4, TSH)
• Additional hormone levels should be assessed in patient with suspected
treatment-related hypophysitis (free T4, TSH, ACTH, morning cortisol,
cosyntropin stimulation test, LH, FSH, testosterone, prolactin) and early
endocrinology referral
• The frequency of laboratory testing was more controversial with most
panelists recommending testing prior to each infusion for most drugs
and less frequent surveillance during follow-up
Imaging Guidelines
• Confirming disease response/progression may be challenging with
immunotherapy due to the delayed kinetics of response and induction
of local inflammation
• The panel (100%) recommends whole body imaging for melanoma
patients treated with immunotherapy prior to starting and at regular
intervals no more than 12 weeks apart while disease persists
• A majority of the panel recommends imaging with CT scans of the
chest, abdomen and pelvis and MRI of the brain
• A minority recommend initial imaging with PET scans
• Imaging should continue after complete responses at regular intervals
for five years to identify recurrence
Treatment Cessation
• Since the kinetics of response to immunotherapy may be delayed
decisions to stop treatment can be challenging
• The panel recommended stopping treatment for any unresolved or
recurrent high grade adverse event or when disease progression is
confirmed by two independent imaging scans or clinical deterioration
• Pseudo-progression has been reported for checkpoint inhibitors and T-VEC
but is rare for interferon and IL-2; most panelists suggested that treatment
with interferon or IL-2 should be stopped with any sign of disease progression
• Repeat imaging within 1–2 months was recommended to confirm response
or progression when pseudo-progression is suspected
• Minority opinions included considering surgical resection for incomplete
responses and tumor biopsy for equivocal cases

tropic and sometimes opposing effects on antitumor im-
munity,
remains
investigational
for
any
stage
of
melanoma, although its incorporation into an oncolytic
virotherapy for intratumoral administration is approved
for advanced melanoma, and its role in combination im-
munotherapy appears promising [12, 36].
Although immunomodulatory therapy is the only
intervention that had ever shown promise in the adju-
vant therapy of melanoma, there is now evidence that
molecularly-targeted therapies can benefit patients with
resected high-risk melanoma whose tumor cells carry an
activating BRAF mutation. A trial of dabrafenib and tra-
metinib given at standard doses (CombiAD), random-
ized 870 patients (1:1) to either the combination of
dabrafenib and trametinib (D/T) or placebo for 1 year.
This trial excluded patients with stage IIIA (N1) with a
< 1 mm metastatic nodal deposit. With a median follow
up of 2.8 years, D/T was associated with improved RFS
(HR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.39–0.58, P < 0.001) and OS (HR
0.57; 95% CI: 0.42–0.79, P < 0.001) compared to placebo.
Moreover, there were no additional safety concerns that
arose with D/T that had not previously been seen in pa-
tients with unresectable or stage IV melanoma [32].
While this combination is not considered immunother-
apy, inhibitors of BRAF and associated pathways in the
tumor cell have been shown to have immunomodulatory
properties that contribute to their activity. For these pa-
tients, the choice between molecularly targeted and im-
mune
checkpoint-based
adjuvant
therapy
remains
unclear, as direct comparisons have not yet been made.
However, benefit was seen across all AJCC 7th (and by
extrapolation 8th) edition stage III subgroups, and this
combination can be considered for any patient with
stage III, BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanoma.
Fig. 3 Stage III N1b-3 (AJCC 7th)/Stage IIIB-D (AJCC 8th) melanoma immunotherapy treatment algorithm. The consensus of the panel was to separate
Stage III N1a (based on AJCC 7th edition) and Stage IIIA (AJCC 8th) from other Stage III subsets based on lower risk of metastatic potential. However, a
minority (30%) felt that all Stage III subsets should be treated similarly. All treatment options shown may be appropriate and final selection of therapy
should be individualized based on patient eligibility and treatment availability at the physician’s discretion. These algorithms represent consensus
sequencing suggestions by the panel. (1) There are limited data on the role of adjuvant therapy following sentinel lymphadenectomy alone. (2) After
evaluation by multi-disciplinary team with surgical oncology, if complete resection is possible patients should undergo resection followed by adjuvant
therapy listed. If the tumor is considered unresectable, a different treatment paradigm should be followed. (3) In patients with Stage IIIB-IV resected
melanoma, there is Level A evidence supporting the use of nivolumab over ipilimumab and pembrolizumab over placebo for stage IIIB-C and IIA
patients with micrometastases > 1 mm. Accordingly, nivolumab or pembrolizumab were supported by 46% of the panel. (4) Ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg
was supported by a minority of panelists (8.3%). (5) There is Level A evidence to support the use the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib in
patients with BRAF V600E/K mutant, Stage III melanoma. (6) While there are Level A data that 1 year interferon-α2b is associated with improvement in
RFS, no panelists recommended considering this therapy for this patient population. (7) Overall, the majority of panelists recommended a clinical trial,
if available. (8) The majority of the panelists have had experience with T-VEC, and half of respondents said they would recommend T-VEC for first-line
treatment for limited disease burden, and a significant minority (39%) would consider T-VEC for patients with locoregional disease. (9) Unresectable
disease could be managed by options available for stage IV patients (see Fig. 4). Abbreviations: CR, complete response; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;

 Consensus management of macroscopic nodal disease
(stage N1b/c, N2b/c, N3b/c in 7th edition or stage IIIB-IIID in
8th edition)
Patients with macroscopic involvement of a single or
multiple lymph nodes (stage N1b and N2b–N3 disease
per AJCC 7th Edition; or Stages IIIB-IIID in AJCC 8th
Edition) are at significant risk for melanoma recurrence.
The panel recommendations for these melanoma pa-
tients are detailed in Fig. 3. Whereas the majority of the
panel in 2014 recommended that these patients consider
1 year of interferon-α2b treatment (73%) [4], in the
current setting, the majority of panelists recommended
either a clinical trial (56%), or if a trial is not available
then adjuvant nivolumab based on the results of the
CheckMate 238 trial, or adjuvant pembrolizumab based
on the results of the recent phase III clinical trial (46%
of panelists) [31, 32, 37]. A minority of panelists would
consider adjuvant ipilimumab (8%) based on the results
of the EORTC 18071 trial [33]. For patients whose
tumor harbors a BRAF V600E/K mutation, combination
dabrafenib/trametinib may be preferred over immuno-
therapy since the impact of adjuvant checkpoint inhibi-
tors
on
the
management
of
subsequent
disease
progression is not known. Of note, no panelists recom-
mend pegylated interferon-α2b for patients with resected
macroscopic nodal disease, and only one panelist consid-
ered high-dose interferon-α2b as an option if a clinical
trial was not available.
CheckMate 238 is a phase 3 trial that randomized 906
patients with resected stage IIIB-IV melanoma to either
1 year of nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or ipilimu-
mab (10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by
every 12 weeks). With minimum follow-up of 18 months,
the trial met its primary endpoint showing that nivolu-
mab was associated with an improved RFS compared
with ipilimumab (RFS at 12 months 70.5% vs. 60.8% for
nivolumab and ipilimumab, respectively; HR 0.65; CI:
0.51–0.83;
P < 0.001).
Furthermore,
the
rate
of
treatment-related grade 3–4 toxicity was 14.4% with
nivolumab vs. 42.6% in patients treated with ipilimumab
[31]. OS data were immature and not reported. The data
from this trial led to the FDA-approval of nivolumab in
patients with resected Stage III melanoma.
More recently, a prospective, double-blind phase III clin-
ical trial was conducted in patients with resected, high-risk
stage III melanoma. In this study patients were eligble if
they had stage IIIB or IIIC, while a subset of patients with
stage IIIA were also included if they had at least one micro-
metastasis measuring > 1 mm. The trial randomly assigned
514 patients to treatment with 200 mg of pembrolizumab
and 505 patients to placebo every 3 weeks for 1 year [37].
In this study, patients were stratified by cancer stage and
geographic location. At a median follow-up of 15 months,
pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer
recurrence-free survival compared to placebo in the
intention-to-treat population (75.4% [95% CI: 71.3–78.9] vs.
61.0% [95% CI: 56.5–65.1]; HR for recurrence or death,
0.57 [98.4% CI: 0.43–0.74; p < 0.001]). In a cohort of 853
patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, the 1-year rate of
recurrence-free survival was 77.1% in the pembrolizumab
treated group compared to 62.6% in the placebo group (HR
0.54; 95% CI: 0.42–0.69). Grade 3 or greater adverse events
were observed in 14.7% of patients treated with pembroli-
zumab - with one treatment-related death attributed to
myositis - versus 3.4% in patients treated with placebo.
In light of these newer data, patients with resected stage
IIIB, IIIC, and IV melanoma could consider several options,
and the panel considered anti-PD-1 antibody therapy with
either nivolumab or pembrolizumab (46%), ipilimumab at
3 mg/kg (8%), D/T in BRAF mutant patients1 (13%), or
high-dose interferon (4%) as acceptable recommendations.
Almost one third of the panel members (29%) were unable
to make a specific recommendation. These members sug-
gested using either anti-PD-1 therapy or D/T, while others
preferred the use of D/T if the tumor was BRAF mutant or
enrollment onto a clinical trial incorporating ipilimumab at
3 mg/kg. The recommendation to use low dose ipilimumab
is supported by data from the phase III U.S. Intergroup
E1609 study in which patients with resected high-risk mel-
anoma were treated with interferon-α, ipilimumab at
10 mg/kg or ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg; while there was no ob-
vious difference in recurrence-free survival between the
two ipilimumab cohorts (although no formal statistical
comparison was performed), there was a significant in-
crease in toxicity reported for the 10 mg/kg cohort com-
pared
with
3
mg/kg
[38].
No
panelists
endorsed
observation as a clinical option.
Consensus management of unresectable stage III/IV
melanoma with injectable lesions
In patients with unresectable stage III disease, the use of
T-VEC, an oncolytic herpes virus engineered to express
GM-CSF, was felt to be appropriate by a significant mi-
nority of panelists (39%). This recommendation was
based on results from a prospective, randomized trial in
which 436 patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV mel-
anoma were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to treatment
with T-VEC or recombinant GM-CSF [12]. The primary
endpoint of the study was durable response rate (DRR),
which was significantly better for T-VEC treated patients
compared to control subjects (16.3% vs. 2.1%, odds ratio
[OR] 8.9; P < 0.001). T-VEC was also associated with im-
proved objective response rate (ORR 26.4% vs. 5.7%) and
OS (median OS 23.3 months for T-VEC vs. 18.9 months
for control, HR 0.79, P = 0.051). On a pre-specified sub-
set analysis, however, a particularly strong effect was
seen in patients with stage IIIB-IVM1a disease, where
the DRR was 33% vs. 0% in stage III patients and 16%
Sullivan et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2018) 6:44 
Page 9 of 23
 vs. 2% for stage IVM1a patients. A similar effect on OS
was seen in the stage III-IVM1a patients with a 43% im-
provement in survival for patients treated with T-VEC
[12]. Thus, there is Level A data supporting T-VEC in
these patients, and T-VEC may be more appropriate for
patients with limited visceral disease. Other options for
this patient population would be enrollment onto a clin-
ical trial or treatment as stage IV melanoma (see Fig. 4).
Of particular interest are the multiple emerging trials of
neo-adjuvant/pre-operative therapy for patients with
melanoma of borderline resectability, who may be better
served by initial cytoreduction and possibly a scenario, if
significant response is seen, where the patient may not
require resection.
Immunotherapy for stage IV melanoma
Initial assessment
In patients with stage lV melanoma, a diagnostic workup
that includes a multidisciplinary team review of clinical and
tumor data should be conducted. Staging should be con-
firmed via pathological evaluation, whole body imaging,
and serum LDH analysis. Genetic mutation analysis of the
tumor should also be performed with special emphasis on
identifying mutations in BRAF. In addition, careful atten-
tion should be paid to central nervous system (CNS) assess-
ment since melanoma patients are at high risk of CNS
metastasis. Thus, in addition to computed tomography
(CT) imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, an MRI of
the brain should be obtained to fully stage potential meta-
static
melanoma
patients.
Surgical
evaluation
by
a
multi-disciplinary team that includes an experienced surgi-
cal oncologist for possible metastectomy is important, espe-
cially in patients with solitary pulmonary metastasis where
complete extirpation is possible. If complete resection of all
metastatic disease is likely, metastasectomy can be consid-
ered based on Level B retrospective outcome studies, but
the panel agreed that this operative management is less
compelling as systemic therapy improves [39–41]. Patients
who achieve partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) fol-
lowing immunotherapy should also be reassessed for pos-
sible resection [42, 43]. The panel recognizes several
systemic treatment options for patients with unresectable
stage
IV
melanoma,
including
immunotherapy
with
high-dose IL-2 (where available), ipilimumab, nivolumab,
pembrolizumab, T-VEC (if accessible lesions are present),
combination ipilimumab and nivolumab, clinical trial par-
ticipation, and cytotoxic chemotherapy [7–12]. Addition-
ally,
vemurafenib,
dabrafenib,
trametinib,
and
the
combinations of either dabrafenib and trametinib or
vemurafenib and cobimetinib are options for patients with
BRAF-mutated tumors [44–48]. An additional combination
regimen of potent BRAF and MEK inhibitors (encorafenib
and binimetinib) is anticipated to receive regulatory ap-
proval in the future.
The panel considered the overall approach to the
patient with stage IV melanoma and, while previous
recommendations suggested that BRAF mutation sta-
tus and performance status be considered as critical
elements in the decision-making process, all Task
Force participants agreed that immunotherapy should
be considered prior to targeted therapy in patients
with good performance status, based on the potential
for durable responses with immunotherapy. There is
little data available to support optimal sequencing of
targeted therapy and immunotherapy in this setting.
However, two retrospective studies have suggested en-
hanced clinical benefit from immunotherapy adminis-
tered
prior
to
BRAF-targeted
therapy
in
those
patients
who
required
both
(those
who
did
not
achieve durable or curative responses to the first line
of therapy) [40, 49]. A data series of 274 patients
with BRAF-mutated melanoma who sequentially re-
ceived BRAF inhibitors and immunotherapy (high--
dose IL-2, ipilimumab, or PD-1 inhibitors) illustrated
that ipilimumab therapy after BRAF inhibitors was as-
sociated with no tumor response and poor survival
[50].
In
another
study
of
93
patients
with
BRAF-mutated melanoma who received BRAF inhibi-
tors (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) before or after ipili-
mumab,
longer
OS
was
found
in
the
cohort
of
patients receiving ipilimumab prior to BRAF inhibitor
therapy (14.5 vs. 9.9 months, P = 0.04) [49]. In both
studies, the response rates to BRAF-targeted therapy
was similar regardless of prior immunotherapy. Thus,
starting with immunotherapy may provide patients
with an opportunity for long-term benefit without
negatively affecting the activity of BRAF inhibitor
therapy. In order to determine optimal sequencing,
the ECOG-ACRIN-led intergroup randomized proto-
col EA6134 (NCT02224781) has been initiated to
compare the sequential administration of ipilimumab/
nivolumab
and
dabrafenib/trametinib.
OS
at
the
2-year landmark, the primary endpoint of this ran-
domized phase 3 trial, is expected to be reported in
2019 or 2020.
In this edition of the guidelines, the panel suggested
that key elements to consider for individual patients
should include clinical performance status, tumor bur-
den, and presence of visceral metastases (compared to
M1a patients with cutaneous, soft tissue or nodal only
metastatic disease), and the tempo of disease progres-
sion. While there is limited evidence, where available,
most immunotherapy agents do appear to be effective
against CNS metastases from melanoma [51–53]. Data
recently reported from two studies also show evidence
that combination nivolumab/ipilimumab has clinical ac-
tivity in patients with asymptomatic brain metastases
[53, 54]. In 75 patients with > 1 measurable brain

 metastasis who received combination ipilimumab/nivo-
lumab, the intracranial response rate (IRR) was 56%
(95% CI: 44–68); in addition, 19% of patients had a
complete response (CR) [54]. Moreover, in 50 patients
with untreated brain metastases, both nivolumab mono-
therapy (ICR 20% [95% CI: 7–41]) and combination ipili-
mumab/nivolumab (ICR 44% [95% CI: 24–65]) were
found to be active [55]. Based on the discussion, recom-
mendations for the management of stage IV melanoma
were considered independently for patients with a good
performance status, generally low disease burden and
slow tempo of disease progression versus patients with a
declining performance status, widespread visceral metas-
tases and/or rapid disease progression (Fig. 4). Extent of
CNS involvement, mass effect, cerebral edema and ster-
oid requirements and symptoms will also factor into
treatment decisions.
Consensus management of stage IV melanoma patients
with a good clinical performance status
The treatment approach for patients with good perform-
ance status stage IV melanoma who are not surgical can-
didates should include an assessment of BRAF mutation
status, history and physical examination, serum LDH,
baseline laboratory evaluation and whole body imaging
(see Table 1), and assessment of tempo of disease, tumor
burden, and presence or absence of CNS disease before
treatment selection. Only a minority of panelists felt that
PD-L1 expression status (15%) or tumor cell mutation
burden (10%) was important for treatment planning. For
a typical patient with a good performance status, regard-
less of BRAF status, a majority of the panel members
recommended enrollment onto a clinical trial (75%) as a
first-line option, followed by treatment with combination
ipilimumab and nivolumab, which was favored over
single-agent PD-1 inhibitor therapy (pembrolizumab or
nivolumab) by three of the five members who did not
favor clinical trial. This ratio of support for combined
ipilimumab
and
nivolumab
versus
single-agent
anti-PD-1 therapy held up by the panel when a clinical
trial was not an option (12 of 20 respondents). Half of
the panelists felt that the selection of the combination of
ipilimumab and nivolumab should mandate transfer of
the patient to a physician or center with more immuno-
therapy experience due to the higher toxicity incidence
and complexity associated with combination immuno-
therapy. Panel members (83%)
also
suggested
that
T-VEC be considered if accessible lesions for injection
are present in patients whose disease has progressed
after combination or monotherapy checkpoint inhibitors
and who still maintain a good performance status.
Participation in clinical trials is dependent on having ac-
cess to appropriate studies and ensuring that patients meet
protocol-specific eligibility requirements. In addition, pa-
tients must be willing to participate in a clinical trial and
provide written, informed consent. The high priority placed

Fig. 4 Stage IV melanoma immunotherapy treatment algorithm. All treatment options shown may be appropriate and final selection of therapy should
be individualized based on patient eligibility and treatment availability at the physician’s discretion. These algorithms represent consensus sequencing
suggestions by the panel. The panel recommended all patients be evaluated with full body imaging, histopathology review, serum LDH, and tumor
mutation analysis with emphasis on BRAF mutations. Other factors to be considered in selecting appropriate treatment should include performance status,
burden and tempo of disease and presence of CNS metastases. (1) All patients should be evaluated for resection by a multi-disciplinary team including
surgical oncology before and after immunotherapy treatment, although the role of surgery is changing and may be appropriate for patients with solitary
pulmonary lesions where complete extirpation is possible; each case must be individualized. (2) All patients should have an MRI of the brain prior to
treatment to rule out or manage CNS metastasis. (3) There was level B data for a clinical benefit with surgical resection when complete excision of all
disease is possible although first-line surgical resection was a minority opinion of the panel. (4) As determined by an experienced surgical oncologist,
patient is eligible to receive surgical intervention as first-line treatment. (5) Immunotherapy was recommended for any patient with a good performance
status regardless of BRAF mutation status and provided that any CNS disease was treated and controlled. Clinical trial was the favored first line approach by
the panel. 6) In the absence of an appropriate clinical trial, the panel recommended combination ipilimumab and nivolumab based on the high response
rates reported. This may also be preferred for patients with CNS disease with a minority of panelists (33.3%) recommending stereotactic radiation prior to
systemic therapy for CNS lesions (7) Next, the panel recommended single agent anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab). The panel considered
these agents to have the same therapeutic efficacy and treatment selection could be based on physician experience and patient preference. (8) The panel
also recommended T-VEC in patients with accessible tumor for injection and limited visceral tumor burden. This option may be especially appropriate for
elderly patients and those not eligible for checkpoint inhibitors. (9) Patients with poor performance status were not considered good candidates for
combination immunotherapy and BRAF mutation was an important factor for determining therapeutic planning. Most panelists considered clinical trials to
be the most important option in these patients, if available. In those patients without a BRAF mutation, the next option should be single agent anti-PD-1
therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab). (10) In patients with poor performance status and a BRAF mutation who are not eligible or whose tumors
progress after a clinical trial, treatment with a BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor therapy is indicated. This option was also considered appropriate for patients with
uncontrolled CNS disease. Single agent anti-PD-1 treatment could be considered if disease progression occurs after targeted therapy. (11) In patients with
disease progression following the recommendations, management should be carefully considered. If patients can tolerate treatment, ipilimumab/
nivolumab should be considered. If patients have a BRAF mutation and have not been treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors previously these can be
considered. Ipilimimab monotherapy and high-dose IL-2 can also be considered in these patients. (12) Patients should have a good PS and otherwise
qualify for IL-2 administration per local institutional guidelines. (13) Dacarbazine is the only approved chemotherapy agent but temozolomide and
carboplatin/paclitaxel are often used as well depending on patient preference and physician experience. Abbreviations: BRAF+, positive for actionable BRAF

 on clinical trials is a reflection of the progress being made
in clinical drug development in melanoma and interest in
defining more effective regimens with acceptable toxicity. If
such clinical trials are not readily available or patients are
not willing or do not qualify for participation, combination
ipilimumab and nivolumab was considered the treatment
of choice for patients with good performance status. This
recommendation was based on a series of prospective clin-
ical trials demonstrating improved response rates with the
combination,
although
increased
incidence
of
immune-related adverse events (irAEs) was also re-
ported. In a phase 1 study, 53 melanoma patients were
treated with concurrent nivolumab (doses ranged from
0.3–10 mg/kg) and ipilimumab (dose ranged from 1 to
10 mg/kg) IV every 3 weeks for four doses followed by
nivolumab alone every 3 weeks for another four doses
[56]. The ORR was 40% based on World Health
Organization (WHO) criteria with a disease control
rate of 65% [56]. Treatment-related adverse events
(TRAEs) were seen in 93% of patients with grade 3 or
greater events from all causes observed in 72%; 53%
were considered treatment-related. The authors con-
cluded that the maximum doses with an acceptable
safety profile were nivolumab at 1 mg/kg and ipilimu-
mab at 3 mg/kg, with objective responses seen in 53%
of patients treated with this dosing regimen [56].
Following the phase 1 data, a double-blind study was
conducted in 142 treatment-naïve, metastatic melanoma
patients and enrolled in a 2:1 manner to treatment with
ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (1 mg/kg) or ipili-
mumab (3 mg/kg) and placebo every 3 weeks for four
doses [57]. Patients in the combination group were able
to receive additional maintenance nivolumab and at a
median follow-up of 24.5 months, 2-year OS was 63.8%
for those in the combination treatment arm vs. 53.6% in
the ipilimumab arm [57]. Of note, patients in the ipili-
mumab arm were permitted to cross over to nivolumab
monotherapy at time of disease progression, making this
trial a study of combination ipilimumab and nivolumab
vs. sequential ipilimumab followed by nivolumab. Inter-
estingly, there was a 22% CR rate and improvement in
progression-free survival (PFS) for the combination al-
though median OS was not reached in either treatment
group. Similar to other trials, the grade 3 or greater
TRAE rate was 54% in the combination cohort com-
pared to 20% in the ipilimumab alone cohort.
These data led to a randomized phase 3 trial in which
945 treatment-naïve patients with unresectable stage III
or IV melanoma were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to
treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab, nivolumab
alone or ipilimumab alone [11]. The study was designed
with two primary endpoints, PFS and OS, with a signifi-
cant improvement seen in PFS (11.5 months for the
combination
treated
patients
vs.
2.9
months
for
ipilimumab alone [HR 0.42, P < 0.001] and 6.9 months
for nivolumab alone [HR 0.57, P < 0.001]). In this study,
patients whose tumors exhibited > 5% PD-L1 expression
had a median PFS of 14 months in both combination
and nivolumab alone arms; however, in patients with
PD-L1 negative tumors, the median PFS was 11.2 months
for combination treated subjects compared to 5.3 months
in patients treated with nivolumab alone. TRAEs of
grade 3 or greater were reported in 55% of the combin-
ation treated patients, 16.3% in those receiving nivolu-
mab alone and 27.3% in the ipilimumab alone cohort. At
a minimum follow-up of 37 months, the median OS has
not been reached for patients on the combination arm
compared to 37.6 months and 19.9 months in patients
receiving nivolumab or ipilimumab alone, respectively
[58]. The three-year OS was 58% for combination ther-
apy patients compared to 52% in nivolumab alone (HR
0.85, 95% CI: 0.68–1.07; non-significant P-value) and
34% in patients treated with ipilimumab alone (HR for
ipilimumab/nivolumab vs. ipilimumab 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45–0.69; P < 0.0001; HR for nivolumab vs. ipilimumab
0.65, 95% CI: 0.53–0.80; P < 0.0001) [58].
The above described studies collectively provide Level A
evidence supporting the role of combination ipilimumab
and nivolumab for first-line treatment in patients with mel-
anoma. However, the lack of a significant OS benefit for the
combination over nivolumab alone, particularly in patients
with BRAF WT or PD-L1-expressing tumors [58], suggests
it is reasonable to consider anti-PD-1 agents alone at this
time. In CheckMate 067, a sub-group analysis showed sig-
nificant improvement in PFS and numerical improvement
in OS with combination therapy only in patients with low
(< 5 and < 1%) PD-L1 staining; however, the panel did not
consider there to be sufficient data to support a role for
PD-L1 expression in clinical decision-making at this time
[56–58]. While adverse events are significantly greater with
combination ipilimumab/nivolumab treatment compared
to monotherapy, there is some evidence that health-related
quality of life may not be significantly impacted by concur-
rent combination treatment [59] due to a greater time with-
out disease related symptoms or treatment toxicity (as
measure by QTWIST) [60].
The panel went on to recommend monotherapy with
anti-PD-1 agents as another option for patients who are
not able to participate in a clinical trial or are not eli-
gible for combination ipilimumab/nivolumab. There are
two agents available, pembrolizumab, which is adminis-
tered at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, and nivolumab ad-
ministered at 240 mg IV every 2 weeks or 480 mg IV
every 4 weeks (per a recent change to non-weight-based
dosing). The panel considered these drugs equally effect-
ive, with indistinguishable toxicities, and advised that se-
lection can be based on physician experience or patient
preference.

 Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are monoclonal anti-
bodies that block the PD-1 T cell checkpoint, and there
are considerable data supporting their use in the treat-
ment of metastatic melanoma. In a clinical dose-finding
study, patients with advanced melanoma were treated
with pembrolizumab (initially called lambrolizumab) at a
dose of 10 mg/kg every two or three weeks or 2 mg/kg
every 3 weeks [9]. Patients were allowed, but not re-
quired, to have had prior ipilimumab therapy to be eli-
gible for study participation. The study enrolled 135
patients and the response rate assessed by standard Re-
sponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
1.1 criteria was 38% without significant differences be-
tween doses or by prior ipilimumab exposure. The re-
sponses were durable with 81% of patients still in
response at a median follow-up of 11 months. The most
frequent adverse events were fatigue, rash, pruritus and
diarrhea, and these were generally grade 2 or less [9].
Pembrolizumab
was
also
evaluated
in
a
separate
multi-institutional phase 1 study evaluating doses of
2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in patients with
ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma [61]. In this
study, 173 patients received 2 mg/kg (n = 89) or 10 mg/
kg (n = 84) pembrolizumab and data were reported at a
median follow-up of 8 months. The response rate by
RECIST was 26% at both doses. Treatment was consid-
ered tolerable with the most frequent TRAEs being fa-
tigue, pruritus, and rash; all were grade 2 or less except
for five patients (3%) who reported grade 3 fatigue [61].
These studies led to the regulatory approval of pembroli-
zumab, at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, for the treat-
ment
of
patients
with
metastatic
melanoma.
The
approved dose and schedule was subsequently changed
to 200 mg IV every 3 weeks.
In a multi-institutional phase 2 study, 540 melanoma
patients with disease that had progressed following ipili-
mumab and BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy, if their tu-
mors
harbored
a
BRAF
(V600)
mutation,
were
randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with pembrolizumab at
2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (N = 180), 10 mg/kg every
3weeks (N = 181) or investigator-choice chemotherapy
(N = 179) [62]. Patients were stratified for performance
status, LDH level and BRAF mutation status. The PFS
was significantly better for patients in both pembrolizu-
mab treatment arms compared to chemotherapy (HR
0.57, P < 0.0001 for 2 mg/kg and HR 0.50, P < 0.0001 for
10 mg/kg). The 6-month PFS was 34% in patients
treated with pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg, 38% at 10 mg/
kg and 16% for chemotherapy. The toxicity profile was
similar to previous pembrolizumab trials with an inci-
dence of grade 3–4 adverse events of 11 and 14% in the
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg cohorts, com-
pared to 26% for patients receiving chemotherapy. These
data were also similar to another global phase 1b clinical
study in which 655 melanoma patients were treated with
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 10 mg/kg every
3 weeks, or 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progres-
sion, intolerable toxicity, or investigator decision to stop
treatment [63]. In this study, investigators evaluated the
impact of pembrolizumab based on prior exposure to
ipilimumab. To address this, 135 patients (48 with prior
ipilimumab and 87 without) were enrolled without
randomization and 520 patients were prospectively ran-
domized (294 with prior ipilimumab and 226 without).
Response rates were reported at a median follow-up of
21 months; response rates were 33% in patients with
prior ipilimumab exposure and 45% in treatment-naïve
patients. The 12-month PFS was 35% overall and 52% in
treatment-naïve
patients,
and
the
median
OS
was
23 months overall and 31 months in treatment-naïve
subjects. Overall, 14% of patients reported at least one
grade 3 or greater TRAE. These results confirmed re-
sponse rates seen in the phase 1 trials and also sup-
ported the 2 mg/kg dosing schedule.
These initial studies were followed by a randomized
phase 3 clinical trial in which 834 patients with ad-
vanced melanoma were randomized 1:1:1 to pembrolizu-
mab (10 mg/kg) every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks or four
doses of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) every 3 weeks [64]. The
study was powered for primary endpoints of PFS and
OS. In this study, the estimated 6-month PFS was 47.3%
for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 46.4% for pembroli-
zumab every 3 weeks and 26.5% for ipilimumab (HR,
0.58; P < 0.001). The response rate was higher with pem-
brolizumab administered every 2 weeks (33.7%) and
every 3 weeks (32.9%), vs. ipilimumab (11.9%) (P < 0.001
for both comparisons) and responses were durable in
89.4, 96.7, and 87.9% of patients, respectively, after a me-
dian follow-up of 7.9 months. Grade 3 or greater TRAEs
were lower in the pembrolizumab cohorts (13.3 and
10.1%) compared to ipilimumab alone (19.9%).
The panel was queried about when single-agent
anti-PD-1, as opposed to combination immunother-
apy, was most appropriate. In considering BRAF mu-
tation, LDH, PD-L1 expression status and mucosal
histology, 42% of panelists stated that PD-L1 expres-
sion was the most important discriminating factor
supporting single agent anti-PD-1 treatment, despite
lack of level A evidence. One each said mucosal mel-
anoma or PD-L1 negative status should prompt com-
bination therapy, two stated that single-agent PD-1
therapy should always be favored, and 10 panelists
felt that a number of other factors should be consid-
ered,
including
medical
co-morbidities
(e.g.
auto-
immune
disease,
history
of
organ
transplantation,
etc.), disease volume/tumor burden, site of disease,
performance
status,
functional
status,
and
patient
preference.

 Pembrolizumab
has
also
been
tested
in
a
non-randomized phase 2 study in 52 patients with CNS
metastases; eighteen patients with melanoma and 34
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presented with
untreated
brain
metastases
and
were
treated
with
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression [65].
Eligible patients had metastatic lesions measuring 5–
20 mm, had no neurologic symptoms, did not require
corticosteroids, and for the NSCLC cohort were re-
quired to have positive tumor PD-L1 expression. A pre-
liminary analysis was reported with evidence of CNS
disease response in 4 of the 18 (22%) patients with mel-
anoma and 6 of 18 (33%) patients with NSCLC. The re-
sponses appeared to be durable and TRAEs were typical
of pembrolizumab toxicity in other studies and only 3
patients (17%) with melanoma had neurologic toxicities,
including grade 3 cognitive dysfunction and grade 1–2
seizures. The authors concluded that pembrolizumab
was safe in patients with CNS metastasis and might be
associated with therapeutic responses.
Finally, a minority of panel members (46%) who were fa-
miliar with T-VEC recommended T-VEC be considered in
patients with good performance status stage IV melanoma
based on the results of the previously mentioned random-
ized phase 3 clinical trial [12]. This requires that tumors
be clinically visible or palpable for injection or be access-
ible by ultrasound guidance. This option may be especially
appropriate for patients who are not candidates for T cell
checkpoint inhibitors, such as patients with significant
co-morbid conditions, or older patients unable to tolerate
significant systemic toxicity (Fig. 4).
Patients with tumors that do not respond to ipilimumab
and nivolumab, monotherapy with anti-PD-1 agents, or
T-VEC should be treated according to the guidelines for
poor performance status patients (see Fig. 4) and treat-
ment selection will depend on BRAF mutation status and
which drug(s) an individual patient has already received.
In general, panel members recommended targeted therapy
(if BRAF mutation is present), combination immunother-
apy (if not previously received and performance status is
good), ipilimumab monotherapy (if the patient has not
been previously exposed to the agent), high-dose IL-2,
clinical trial participation, or chemotherapy.
There is considerable evidence supporting a role for
high-dose IL-2 in the treatment of patients with stage IV
melanoma, and the drug has been approved since 1998.
A fairly consistent ORR of 16–17%, including 6–7%
CRs, has been reported [7]. Further analysis of the ori-
ginal 270 patients treated in the regulatory trials at a
median follow-up at 7 years demonstrated a median dur-
ation of response that was unchanged in patients achiev-
ing an initial CR or PR at 8.9 and 5.9 months,
respectively [66]. The benefits of IL-2 and contemporary
management of IL-2-related toxicity has been previously
reported [4, 67]. Treatment generally requires referral to
centers with experience in management of high-dose
IL-2 and patients should have a good performance status
when starting treatment.
Consensus management of patients with stage IV
melanoma and poor clinical performance status
The panel considered that patients with a poor or de-
clining performance status, those with extensive disease
burden, rapid tempo of progression, presence of active
CNS disease and those that have documented disease
progression after T cell checkpoint inhibitors or T-VEC
should be treated differently than those with overall
good performance status, limited disease burden, slow
tempo of progression and without active CNS metasta-
sis. Patients with poor performance status should have
BRAF mutation analysis to determine if there is a V600
or other targetable mutation, for which targeted therapy
regimens are available [44–48]. Noting that clinical trial
participation in patients with poor performance status is
challenging
due
to
protocol restrictions,
the
panel
applauded efforts by the ASCO-Friends of Cancer Re-
search working group, which is taking steps to broaden
clinical trial eligibility and recommended that, whenever
feasible, these patients be considered for clinical trial
participation whether or not their tumor harbors a
BRAF mutation (see Fig. 4). In the absence of a BRAF
mutation, and if clinical trials are not an option, the
panel
recommended
treatment
with
single
agent
anti-PD-1 therapy, such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab
based on the Level A data described above. In patients
whose tumor harbors a BRAF mutation and who are not
eligible for clinical trial participation, treatment with
BRAF/MEK targeted therapy should be considered, and
readers are referred elsewhere for guidance on adminis-
tration of these agents [68]. If patients progress on tar-
geted therapy or are not eligible for such agents,
monotherapy with pembrolizumab or nivolumab is rec-
ommended. There is evidence for activity with both
BRAF/MEK inhibitors and anti-PD-1 agents alone or
with ipilimumab in the treatment of CNS metastasis
[69]. Combination ipilimumab/nivolumab could also be
considered in selected patients where they have not pre-
viously received such treatment, the performance status
decline
is
not
related
to
significant
medical
co-morbidities and the patients is clinically able to toler-
ate therapy. While response rates are notably higher
with combination ipilimumab/nivolumab, the incidence
of serious adverse events is also higher, and the risk/
benefit ratio must be considered on an individual basis.
The majority of the panel (67%) recommended combin-
ation ipilimumab/nivolumab for treatment of CNS mel-
anoma, while a minority of the panel (33%) would treat
individual CNS lesions with stereotactic radiation prior
Sullivan et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2018) 6:44 
Page 15 of 23
 to systemic immunotherapy, and this may require con-
sultation/coordination with neurosurgery and/or radi-
ation oncology specialists [65, 70]. As always, disease
symptomatology and corticosteroid requirements will in-
fluence treatment decisions.
In patients who have failed the above treatments, re-
gardless of performance status, other therapeutic options
should include renewed consideration of targeted ther-
apy in patients with BRAF mutated tumors if this has
not been previously used. Other options include clinical
trial participation, single agent ipilimumab, high-dose
IL-2, T-VEC, and cytotoxic chemotherapy (Fig. 4).
Ipilimumab was initially approved for the treatment of
metastatic melanoma based on several clinical trials that
demonstrated durable responses and improvement in
OS [8, 71]. Further follow-up studies have confirmed the
potential for durable responses and long-term survival
providing Level A data supporting a role for ipilimumab
in melanoma [72, 73]. Here we summarize key data from
ipilimumab trials that support the rationale for its use in
the second-line setting in patients with advanced melan-
oma. The first important study was a multi-institutional,
double-blind, randomized phase 3 trial in which 676 pa-
tients
with
advanced
melanoma
expressing
human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 were randomized to treat-
ment with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four
doses), ipilimumab (same dose and schedule) given with
an HLA-A2-restricted modified gp100 peptide vaccine,
or vaccine alone [8]. Overall, patients treated with ipili-
mumab demonstrated improved OS compared to pa-
tients receiving vaccine alone (10 months vs. 6 months;
P = 0.0026). This study led to FDA approval for ipilimu-
mab as single agent therapy for melanoma in 2011. An-
other
prospective,
randomized
clinical
trial
was
subsequently
reported
in
which
502
patients
with
treatment-naive melanoma were randomized to ipilimu-
mab at 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses and
dacarbazine (850 mg/m2) or dacarbazine (850 mg/m2)
and placebo [71]. This trial reported improved OS in pa-
tients
treated
with
ipilimumab
and
dacarbazine
(11.2 months vs. 9.1 months; P < 0.001). The study also
reported
improved
3-year
survival
of
20.8%
for
ipilimumab-dacarbazine-treated patients compared to
12.2% for dacarbazine alone (HR 0.72; P < 0.001). An up-
date of this study population demonstrated 5-year sur-
vival rate of 18.2% in patients in the ipilimumab and
dacarbazine cohort compared to 8.8% in the dacarbazine
alone arm (P = 0.002) [72]. A plateau in the survival
curve was observed around 3 years and persisted out to
5 years. The authors also reported safety and found the
only persistent grade 3 or greater irAEs involved the
skin. In order to better estimate the survival benefit in
patients treated with ipilimumab, a retrospective, pooled
analysis of 1861 patients treated in 10 prospective and 2
retrospective trials was performed [73]. Across all stud-
ies included in the analysis, median OS was 11.4 months
(range 10.7–12.1 months) and the investigators saw a
similar plateau in the survival curve at approximately
3 years. A 3-year survival rate of 22% was seen in all pa-
tients with 26% in treatment-naïve subjects and 20% in
previously treated patients. Ipilimumab has also been
shown to have activity against CNS metastases in a sin-
gle arm phase 2 clinical trial [74]. A randomized clinical
study in 245 unresectable stage III-IV melanoma pa-
tients evaluated ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg intravenously
on day 1 and GM-CSF at 250 μg subcutaneously on days
1–14 of each 21-day cycle [36]. In this study, an im-
provement in overall survival for the combination treat-
ment
was
observed
(17.5
vs.
12.7
months)
and,
unexpectedly, the incidence of serious grade 3 or greater
adverse events was lower in the combination group
compared to ipilimumab alone (44.9% vs. 58.3%). Al-
though promising, further validation of this combination
in a larger sample size and at ipilimumab doses of 3 mg/
kg are needed.
Some panel members also recommended T-VEC in
this setting. There is limited evidence supporting this
recommendation. In the randomized phase 3 study, a
subset analysis found that durable response was higher
than control therapy in treatment-naïve patients (24%
vs. 0%) when compared to those receiving T-VEC as
second-line or later therapy (10 vs. 4%), and a similar
trend toward better OS was seen when T-VEC was used
in the first-line setting [12]. As mentioned, T-VEC treat-
ment requires accessible lesions for direct injection.
Thus, while IL-2 and T-VEC are good options to con-
sider, careful patient selection is required to optimize
therapeutic benefit.
Special issues in tumor immunotherapy for melanoma
The panel recognized that there are several unique is-
sues related to clinical management of patients with
melanoma opting for immunotherapy. These include is-
sues related to the clinical integration of biomarkers, la-
boratory assessment, and imaging in the management of
patients before and during treatment. There are also
concerns over management of irAEs that are unique to
immunotherapy treatment and guidelines for when to
stop therapy given the potential for delayed regression.
While the panel largely acknowledged that there is only
Level C data to inform decision-making with respect to
these issues, consensus recommendations were made
and are summarized in Table 1.
Consensus management of immune-related adverse events
Immunotherapy is associated with irAEs that manifest as
autoimmune-like phenomenon involving lymphocytic
infiltration and inflammation of various tissues and
Sullivan et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2018) 6:44 
Page 16 of 23
 organ systems. These events may range from vitiligo not
requiring intervention to more serious episodes of
immune-related colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis and hypo-
physitis [75]. More recently, there have been rare case
reports of immune-related myocarditis associated with
mortality [76–78]. These events are problematic and
may occur early in the treatment course or weeks to
even months after stopping therapy, and a high level of
clinical suspicion must be maintained in patients treated
with immunotherapy. The panel did not specifically ad-
dress
toxicity
management
in
detail
but
endorsed
current clinical recommendations to educate patients
and caregivers about toxicities, monitor patients care-
fully for emergence of potential irAEs, rapidly rule out
other causes and initiate corticosteroid management
once a high-grade immune-mediated event is identified.
There is currently some controversy as to whether there
is an association between irAEs and improved thera-
peutic responses [79]. The panel, however, felt the data
were strong enough to demonstrate prolonged responses
even after treatment was stopped due to toxicity, and
with the use of steroids; thus, the panel did not recom-
mend continued treatment through significant toxicity
for the purpose of enhancing clinical response.
In patients who experience grade 2 or greater adverse
events, treatment may be withheld during acute manage-
ment and resumed upon resolution, but treatment will
likely need to be permanently discontinued in the face of a
high grade or recurrent immune-mediate adverse event
[14]. Additional management guidelines are widely antici-
pated in the near future and clinicians should monitor the
literature for new guidance in this area. Several groups, in-
cluding the SITC Toxicity Management Working Group,
have recently published guidelines to address the manage-
ment of adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibition
[80–82]. We have previously reported on the management
of acute IL-2 and interferon-related side effects, including
interferon-associated depression in the first consensus
statement on melanoma [4].
Consensus statement on predictive biomarkers for
melanoma immunotherapy
The panel acknowledged the importance of identifying pre-
dictive biomarkers to help inform clinical decision-making
in melanoma immunotherapy. Preliminary reports of higher
response rates in patients treated with T cell checkpoint in-
hibitors who have high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and
PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment sug-
gested these factors might serve as biomarkers [83]. In fact,
PD-L1 expression has been used for patient selection and is
associated with improved outcomes with anti-PD-1 therapy
in NSCLC [84]. Nonetheless, PD-L1 expression has not
been validated for melanoma patient selection or thera-
peutic monitoring, and this may relate to differences in the
assay sensitivity or reliability, the dynamic regulation of
PD-L1 expression and sampling error [85]. At this time,
PD-L1 expression is not considered valuable in clinical
management of patients with melanoma by the majority
(58%) of the consensus panel. However, some panelists did
consider
PD-L1
expression
as
important
in
clinical
decision-making in special situations, such as in patients
with co-morbid medical conditions that might preclude
combination immunotherapy (25% of panelists), patients
older than 65 years of age (8%), patients less than 65 years
of age (4%) or in the presence of BRAF mutation (4%). In
these settings, high PD-L1 expression would support using
single agent PD-1 blockade and reserve combination ther-
apy for those without PD-L1 expression since these patients
are less likely to respond to monotherapy [58].
Mutation burden in the tumor has also recently been rec-
ognized as a potential predictor of response to immuno-
therapy with T cell checkpoint inhibitors [86, 87]. Thus, it is
interesting to note that melanoma, NSCLC and other tu-
mors where these agents have shown clinical activity appear
to be associated with higher levels of mutations within the
tumor genome [86, 88, 89]. The biologic basis of this find-
ing may be due to the emergence of neoantigens derived
from the mutations resulting in abnormal proteins and
peptide fragments within the tumor cells allowing recogni-
tion by T cells that might not recognize the native peptide
[81]. Thus, mutation burden could be an important pre-
dictor of benefit for treatment with immunotherapy. In its
first tissue-agnostic approval based on a biomarker, the
FDA recently granted accelerated approval to pembrolizu-
mab for the treatment of patients with unresectable or
metastatic mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsat-
ellite instability-high (MSI-H) solid tumors that have pro-
gressed after prior treatment and have no alternative
treatment options. This approval was based on data from
149 patients across 5 single-arm clinical trials in which
pembrolizumab illustrated an ORR of 39.6%, including 11
CRs and 48 PRs [90]. Similar results led to approval of
nivolumab in this population based on results from the
CheckMate 142 clinical trial [91]. Another area of intense
investigation is the association between therapeutic effect-
iveness of immunotherapy regimens and the presence of
IFN-γ-related gene signatures within the tumor microenvir-
onment [92]. While the Task Force agreed with the import-
ance of emerging data in this area, there are not sufficient
prospective validation studies to recommend use of these
parameters for clinical decision-making for patients with
melanoma at this time (see Table 1).
Consensus statement on laboratory assessment for
melanoma patients on immunotherapy
The panel strongly recommended routine baseline and
surveillance laboratory assessments be performed on pa-
tients undergoing treatment with tumor immunotherapy.
Sullivan et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2018) 6:44 
Page 17 of 23
 While panelists acknowledged a lack of evidence-based
data in this area, serum LDH is considered an important
prognostic marker as it is part of the current AJCC (v7
and v8) staging for melanoma, and toxicity management
is supported by careful laboratory analysis with baseline
values for comparison. Clinicians should be alert for signs
and symptoms of irAEs, which can present with isolated
laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated hepatic en-
zymes, serum creatinine, amylase, lipase, glucose and
others. A baseline complete blood count, serum chemistry
panel to evaluate hepatic, renal and electrolyte parameters,
and a thyroid function panel that includes at least free T4
and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) should be ob-
tained on all patients. With increasing awareness of the
risk of myocarditis, monitoring of creatine kinase and
troponin I or T should also be considered. The panel also
unanimously agreed that these same laboratory assays
should be repeated during therapy but there was no agree-
ment on the frequency of assessment. Some panel mem-
bers suggested obtaining lab work prior to each infusion,
whereas others suggested early monitoring and then limit-
ing collection to periodic assessment or as clinically indi-
cated. Patients who present with signs or symptoms of
possible hypophysitis should have additional hormone
levels monitored prior to starting corticosteroid interven-
tion (see Table 1 for recommended panel).
Consensus statement on imaging for melanoma patients on
immunotherapy
The type and frequency of imaging for patients with
melanoma treated with immunotherapy continues to be
controversial and there are no prospective, randomized
clinical trials to guide clinical decision-making. Since
tumor regression may be delayed with immunotherapy,
appropriate imaging becomes increasingly important to
ensure patients achieve optimal therapeutic benefit.
Thus, all panel members recommended that whole body
imaging be performed prior to and at regular intervals
during immunotherapy. The majority of the panel use
computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdo-
men and pelvis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
of the brain. Additional imaging may also be necessary
in some patients with suspected disease in locations not
imaged with these scans, such as the neck or extremities.
A minority of panel members recommended whole body
positron emission tomography (PET) or PET–CT scans
as the preferred imaging modality. The false-positive rate
for PET imaging and difficulty providing definitive lesion
measurements were reasons cited for preferring CT and
MRI imaging by the majority of panel participants. Al-
though the panel recognized the absence of Level A data
to support post-treatment imaging, the consensus rec-
ommendation was that patients should be followed every
3–12 months with whole body CT imaging and selective
brain imaging depending on tumor stage and location,
the disease-free period from initial diagnosis and as clin-
ically indicated (see Table 1). A minority opinion sug-
gested that imaging could be individualized for each
patient.
Consensus statement on clinical endpoints and treatment
cessation
The panel considered the issue of when to stop treat-
ment, which is complicated in patients receiving im-
munotherapy
since
“pseudo-progression”
has
been
reported and is thought to be related to delayed re-
sponse kinetics and/or tumor immune infiltration. This
possibility has suggested that additional criteria may be
needed to assess response optimally and avoid discon-
tinuing treatment in patients who might experience de-
layed
regression;
these
criteria
have
been
termed
immune-related response criteria (irRC) or iRECIST [93,
94]. While pseudo-progression has been reported with
ipilimumab [8] and T-VEC [12], there is some evidence
that this phenomenon may also occur with anti-PD-1
agents [95]. In a review of 655 patients treated with
pembrolizumab, 24 (7%) had atypical responses defined
as “early pseudo-progression” in 15 (5%) and “delayed
pseudo-progression” in 9 (3%) by the investigators [95].
This study also found 14% of patients had progression
by RECIST criteria but did not meet the definition for
disease progression by the irRC and suggested that clin-
ical benefit may be underestimated if standard RECIST
criteria are used in monitoring clinical endpoints for im-
munotherapy studies. There are also case reports of
pseudoprogression of melanoma brain metastases in pa-
tients treated with pembrolizumab [96].
The panel generally agreed that new lesions or an in-
crease in tumor burden in patients treated with inter-
feron or IL-2 is cause for treatment cessation. The
assessment of response in patients receiving T cell
checkpoint inhibitors or T-VEC is more challenging.
The majority of the panel recommends that patients
with disease progression by imaging and who are clinic-
ally asymptomatic without a decline in performance sta-
tus can be safely continued on treatment and re-imaged
in 1–2 months to evaluate response. There is limited
Level B evidence to support this position. In a retro-
spective study using pooled data of 526 randomized pa-
tients

= 85) were compared to those patients who immediately
discontinued nivolumab at first signs of disease progres-
sion (N = 221). The authors reported that 24 of the 85
(28%) patients treated beyond progression went on to
experience greater than 30% regression after further
therapy
[97].

 patients might derive further clinical benefit from con-
tinued treatment beyond progression. The panel also
recommended that patients with unacceptable toxicity
or clinical deterioration should be promptly removed
from treatment and only if disease progression is docu-
mented should they move on to another therapeutic
regimen.
In addition, it is critical that clinicians monitoring mel-
anoma patients on immunotherapy be able to confirm
clinical responses and stop therapy at an appropriate
timepoint. The panel recognized that there is consider-
able controversy on how best to define when to stop
therapy and agreed that there may be limited evidence
to support continued treatment beyond disease progres-
sion. Because of this uncertainty, the panel considered
confirmation of objective responses to be important for
optimal clinical decision making, and suggested that pa-
tients achieving CR, PR or SD, should be re-imaged
within 2–3 months to confirm response. A minority of
the panel suggested that patients with incomplete re-
sponses, and where all remaining sites of disease can be
completely excised, could be considered for surgical
management or biopsy to confirm existence of viable
tumor in these areas and/or identify other potential
treatment options (e.g., through mutational burden ana-
lysis). Finally, the panel was asked about scenarios in
which it would be appropriate to stop therapy in a pa-
tient with SD or better response. Of the panelists
responding, 4% would be comfortable stopping therapy
once a patient achieves a radiographic complete re-
sponse, 8% would stop after achieving PET-CT-based
complete response, and 29% would stop after completing
2 years of therapy. A further 38% would consider any of
these endpoints appropriate to prompt treatment dis-
continuation. Five panelists had alternative suggestions
as to when to stop treatment: after 1–2 years of therapy
if disease remains stable, 1 year after documentation of a
CR, or after a radiographic CR or 2 years of therapy.
None of the panelists felt that pathologic CR was neces-
sary to halt treatment.
The data to support these recommendations are, to be
fair, premature. With that said, the above recommenda-
tions are made based on the anecdotal experience of
each panel member who have seen the maintenance of
prolonged clinical benefit off therapy, appreciating that
the risks of continuing therapy indefinitely are legitim-
ate, and the available data from melanoma clinical trials
are premature. The existing published data come from
the Keynote 001 study, which enrolled 655 patients with
melanoma, 105 of whom developed a CR. With a me-
dian follow up of 30 months from first identification of
CR, the chance of maintaining a CR was 91% in the 105
patients treated beyond response and 90% in the 67 pa-
tients who discontinued therapy for observation after
CR, which was allowable per protocol [98]. In presented
data at ASCO 2017, Robert and colleagues presented
data from the Keynote 006 (described above) showing
that in the 104 patients with SD, PR, or CR who com-
pleted 2 years of therapy with a median follow up off
pembrolizumab of 9.7 months, 23 of 24 CRs and 60 of
64 PRs remained in response, while 8 of 10 patients with
SD remained with stable disease.
Further, a recent pooled retrospective analysis of 2624
melanoma patients treated with PD-1 blockade from
eight multi-center clinical trials submitted to the FDA,
identified 692 of 1361 patients (51%) who had continued
PD-1-directed
treatment
after
documentation
of
RECIST-defined progressive disease [99]. The authors
pooled data from all patients and found 19% of patients
treated beyond progression had a 30% or greater de-
crease in tumor burden and this represented 4% of the
entire 2624 patient population. The median overall sur-
vival was also greater in patients treated beyond progres-
sion
compared
to
patients
who
did
not
receive
treatment beyond progression (24.2 vs. 11.2 months). In
this study, the rate of serious adverse events was slightly
lower in the patients treated beyond progression com-
pared to patients who stopped treatment at progression
(43% vs. 54%), and immune-related adverse events were
similar in incidence in both groups. The authors con-
cluded
that
treatment
beyond
progression
with
anti-PD-1 therapy in might be appropriate in selected
melanoma patients but clinical benefit remains to be
proven.
Conclusions
The approval of six new immunotherapy agents since
2011 has led to the emergence of cancer immunotherapy
as the standard of care for patients with high-risk and
advanced melanoma. However, limited data are available
to guide optimal patient selection, treatment sequencing
and clinical monitoring during therapy. Immunotherapy
differs from standard chemotherapy in its mode of ac-
tion, in being associated with a higher likelihood of dur-
able
response
when
response
occurs,
and
in
the
potential for delayed response and appearance of irAEs
that require clinical diligence to detect and treat. Further
progress in the field is anticipated to focus on combin-
ation immunotherapy strategies between two or more
immunotherapy agents and with targeted therapies,
metabolic (e.g., indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase [IDO], vas-
cular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) inhibitors and
adoptively transferred T cells. This updated SITC con-
sensus statement provides recommendations by an ex-
pert panel of melanoma specialists to assist in the
clinical management of melanoma patients treated with
immunotherapy, the use of which provides a beneficial
therapeutic option for patients with melanoma.
