Abstract 
Self-initiated voluntary acts, such as pressing a button, are preceded by a negative electrical 
brain potential, the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), that can be recorded over the human scalp 
using electroencephalography (EEG). Up to now, the BP required to initiate voluntary acts has 
only been recorded under well-controlled laboratory conditions.  
It is thus not known if this form of brain activity also underlies motor initiation in possible life-
threatening decision making, such as jumping into a 192-meter abyss, an act requiring 
extraordinary willpower. Here, we report BP before self-initiated 192-meter extreme bungee 
jumping across two semi-professional cliff divers (both male, mean age 19.3 years). We found 
that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the BP is comparable to that recorded under laboratory 
conditions. These results, possible through recent advancements in wireless and portable EEG 
technology, document for the first time pre-movement brain activity preceding possible life-
threatening decision making. 
 
Introduction 
The decision to perform a self-initiated act, such as releasing an arrow during 
Kyūdō (Japanese art of archery), pushing off for the first glide in alpine (downhill) skiing or 
jumping from a rock in cliff diving, requires integration and synchronization of internal and 
external sensory information1, as well as a sense for the opportune moment for action (a 
moment termed καιρός in Ancient Greek, e.g. Ilias IV, 185)2. Developing this sense often 
requires many years of training, particularly when motor initiation involves possible life-
threatening decision making.  
 
For a long time, the neural origins of self-initiated acts remained an enigma. While 
neurophysiological experimentations up to the 1960ies were mainly influenced by 
behaviourism 
focusing 
on 
stimulus-response 
paradigms, 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
Bereitschaftspotential (BP) in 1965 (engl. readiness potential)3,4 signified an entirely new 
direction in neurophysiological research investigating the neural substrate of self-initiated 
voluntary acts, i.e. acts that are not triggered by external stimuli.  
Due to the non-stationary and dynamic nature of brain activity, stimulus-response paradigms 
usually require averaging of brain activity over multiple trials. This can be easily achieved by 
using the stimulus as the common starting point (trigger) for averaging. Due to lack of a known 
starting point, however, such approach cannot be applied to unpredictable self-initiated 
movements. Building on early EEG systems that used ferromagnetic tapes to store the 
recorded signals, an important technological innovation and prerequisite for the discovery of

the BP was to reverse such tapes and use the onset of electromyographic (EMG) activity 
related to a volitional act, e.g. moving a finger, as marker for reverse computation 
(“Rückwärtsanalyse”) of the EEG signal5. In the original experiment, EEG signals of 
approximately 250 trials were averaged and evidenced a negative electric potential building 
up approximately 1.5 s before the onset of EMG activity (Fig. 1A). Study participants had to sit 
still in a Faraday cage with their head reclined into a headrest to avoid EEG artefacts (Fig. 1B). 
The recorded brain potential was most evident at the vertex electrode and reached amplitudes 
of up to 10-15 μV3,4. Based on the waveform and involved generators, two phases of the BP 
can be distinguished: the “early BP” recordable over the supplementary motor area (SMA), 
pre-SMA and lateral premotor cortex beginning about 1.5 s before movement onset, and the 
“late BP” with a steep negative slope recordable over the contralateral primary motor cortex 
(M1) and lateral premotor cortex beginning approximately 400 ms before movement onset6,7.  
 
Using a multimodal neuroimaging approach based on functional magnet resonance imaging 
(fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), Cunnigton et al.8 showed a specific correlation 
between global electric field power of pre-movement neural activity and the metabolic (i.e. 
blood-oxygen-level dependent, BOLD) activity of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC). By 
applying dynamic causal modelling, they found strong reciprocal interactions between the 
aMCC and the supplementary motor areas (SMA) that they identified to be important for the 
sustained activity during the early BP. Moreover, besides involvement of the cortico-basal 
ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop (motor loop), a number of studies indicate that the prefrontal 
cortex (PFC), a region that was found to be tightly linked to the concept of willpower9 (i.e. the 
capacity to override an unwanted thought, feeling or impulse), decision making and executive 
control10, plays a critical role for initiation of voluntary movements11. Particularly the medial part 
of the PFC (mPFC) was shown to be important for regulating neuronal circuits linked to fear 
and anxiety12.  
 
While it was shown that the magnitude and waveform of the BP depend on various factors, 
such as force exerted, speed and precision of movement as well as pace of movement 
repetitions or complexity of movement13, it was unknown whether the BP also underlies 
movement initiation in possible life-threatening decision making, such as self-initiating a jump 
into a 192-meter abyss. The main reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite numerous 
replications and several thousand publications since its discovery, the BP has never been 
recorded in a real-life situation outside the laboratory where motor initiation in possible life-
threatening decision making can be investigated.

Today, more than 50 years after the discovery of the BP, EEG technology has improved across 
multiple domains, particularly in terms of miniaturization, digitization and wireless signal 
transmission. State-of-the-art wireless EEG systems can record from up to 64-channels with 
24-bit A/D conversion and input noise peak-to-peak levels below 2 µV. Especially, the 
development of active EEG electrodes, i.e. electrodes with build-in readout circuitry that locally 
amplify and buffer EEG signals before transmitting the signals through cablings, have 
improved signal quality14. These advancements fostered the development of innovative 
neurotechnologies, such as brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that translate brain activity into 
control commands of external machines, robots or computers. Recently, it was shown, for 
example, that severely paralyzed quadriplegics can operate an EEG-controlled brain/neural 
hand-exoskeleton (B/NHE) to perform activities of daily living, such as eating and drinking in 
an outside restaurant15. We, thus, reasoned that, under optimal conditions, recording of the 
BP outside the laboratory might be feasible, even in extreme real-life scenarios such as 192-
meter bungee jumping.  
 
Deriving from an ancient ritual on Vanuatu, an island in the South Pacific Ocean, bungee 
jumping, i.e. jumping from a tall structure while fixed to an elastic cord, has become a popular 
and commercialized activity with millions of jumps since the 1980ies. Besides representing a 
test of courage (bungee jumping was seen as an expression of boldness in ancient Vanuatu), 
it was shown that bungee jumping can result in a marked increase of euphoria ratings and 
concentration of beta-endorphin (by more than 200 %) measured immediately after a bungee 
jump16. Here, we report successful recording of the BP across two semi-professional cliff divers 
who performed several bungee jumps from a 192-meter bungee platform (the second highest 
bungee platform in Europe). To evaluate the impact of possible life-threatening decision 
making on the BP’s spatiotemporal dynamics, such as onset and waveform, BPs recorded 
before bungee jumping were compared to BPs recorded before the same subjects jumped 
from a 1-meter block.  
 
Results  
Analysis of EEG recordings showed a clear negative deflection beginning approximately 1.5 s 
before movement onset (Fig. 2A). The maximum EEG deflection across all bungee jumps 
ranged at 17.62±1.09 µV.  
 
Further analysis evidenced successful detection of a BP before bungee jumping (jumper 1: M 
= -19.23 µV, SD = 9.21 µV, t(9) = -2.087, p = .033; jumper 2: M = -10.49 µV, SD = 4.12 µV, 
t(11) = -2.548, p = .014) and jumping from a 1-meter block (jumper 1: M = -11.63 µV, SD =

2.71 µV,  t(14) = -4.293, p < .001; jumper 2: M = -8.37 µV, SD = 3.86 µV, t(11) = -2.167, p = 
.027). 
 
We found no difference in BP onset comparing BPs recorded before bungee jumping (jumper 
1: Mdn = -1.81 s; jumper 2: Mdn = -1.29 s) and BPs recorded before jumping from a 1-meter 
block (jumper 1: Mdn = -1.80 s; jumper 2: Mdn = -1.06 s) (jumper 1: U = 75, p = .978, jumper 
2: U = 72, p = .684).  
Moreover, comparison between BP waveforms recorded before bungee jumping and BP 
waveforms recorded before 1-meter block jumping showed a strong correlation across both 
jumpers (jumper 1: rs = .639, p < .001; jumper 2: rs = .80, p < .001).  
 
Discussion 
To our knowledge, this is the first report on successful recordings of the BP outside the 
laboratory and in the context of self-initiating a voluntary act in possible life-threatening 
decision making. We found that the BP can be successfully detected by averaging EEG data 
from less than 15 trials documenting feasibility of such recordings outside the laboratory. BPs 
recorded before self-initiated 192-meter bungee jumps involving possibly life-threatening 
decision making and BPs recorded before 1-meter block jumps under laboratory conditions 
showed comparable spatiotemporal dynamics. While the necessarily low number of trials 
demonstrates that the pre-bungee jumping BP is very well expressed, the small number of 
subjects and trials constraints the possibility to generalize these findings towards other real-
life scenarios.       
 
Catalysed by Benjamin Libet’s experiments in the 1980ies17 indicating that the conscious 
decision for a self-initiated act occurs not earlier than 200-250 ms before the onset of EMG 
activity, the discovery of the BP led to a vivid and controversial discussion about the free will18 
(it should be noted that neither Kornhuber and Deecke19 nor Libet ever called human freedom 
or free will into question20. While Kornhuber and Deecke admit that “absolute freedom from 
nature is an impossibility”19 leaving humans relative freedom, or freedom in degrees, Libet 
argued that, even if a volitional process is initiated unconsciously, the conscious function can 
still control the outcome by exerting a veto). While it is unlikely that neurophysiological 
experiments can decisively contribute to solving this controversy, feasibility of BP recordings 
in real-life scenarios allow for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying self-initiated 
voluntary acts under realistic conditions. In this context, EEG recordings using a larger number 
of electrodes (≥ 32) and application of advanced signal processing techniques, such as 
connectivity11 or entropy measures21,22, may provide important insights regarding the involved

brain networks and their interactions. Moreover, implementation of real-time signal processing 
within the framework of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allows answering some profound 
research questions, for example determining the point in time at which people are still able to 
cancel (“veto”) a movement after the elicitation of a BP23,24. Moreover, establishing BCIs based 
on motor-related cortical potentials (MRCP)25 that include the BP to detect movement 
intentions in everyday life environments may critically enhance existing BCI systems, e.g. to 
restore activities of daily living to quadriplegics15 or in the context of neurorehabilitation26. 
Besides further substantiating that neurotechnologies, i.e. technological tools to interact with 
the brain, are now about to enter everyday life environments27, our report shows that brain 
physiological assessments previously regarded unfeasible, e.g. assessment of the BP outside 
the laboratory and under extreme conditions, are viable and can extend the possibility to test 
scientific hypotheses that were previously un-testable.  
 
It could be argued that, in most lab-based investigations, decision-making, i.e. the decision to 
obey the instruction to self-initiate a particular movement, e.g. to press a button, was already 
concluded before the beginning of the actual experiment. If so, subjects have only to decide 
when to press and not whether to press. In bungee jumping or other extreme activities that 
involve possibly life-threatening decision making, this decision-making process cannot be 
assumed to be concluded at any point in time before the actual jump. Many bungee jumping 
novices interrupt their first attempt and need an external trigger to overrule their inner 
resistance. Even bungee jumpers with year-long experience and dozens of jumps report that 
each jump requires them to overcome this inner resistance suggesting a decisive role of the 
PFC coordinating neuronal circuits related to willpower, executive functions and fear 
responses. While our data indicate that this coordination process does not influence the onset 
or waveform of the pre-bungee jumping BP, the limited number of electrodes and trials did not 
allow for analyses of fronto-parietal cortico-cortical interactions. Further studies are needed to 
elucidate these possible network interactions and their relationship to the generation of the BP. 
In this context, use of virtual reality may be particularly helpful as a complementary approach 
to investigate the neural origins of self-initiated acts also in laboratory environments.  
 
Methods  
Experimental setup 
Two semi-professional cliff divers (both males, mean age 19.3 years) performed self-initiated 
voluntary jumps, once outside the laboratory from a 192-meter bungee jumping platform 
(operator: Rupert Hirner Bungee Jumping GmbH, Europa Bridge in Innsbruck, Austria; 
http://www.europabruecke.at/), and once under well-controlled laboratory conditions from a 1-

meter block. The jumpers were informed by the platform operator that they were free to jump 
as often as they liked, and that all jumps were entirely voluntary and could be aborted at any 
time.  
Before the jumps, specific instructions on how to perform the jumps without generating 
excessive muscle artefacts and a clear trigger signal for reverse computation were provided 
(e.g. keeping head motions and blinking to a minimum, relaxing the arms and trunk, initiating 
the jump by coming up on the toes and bending forward). Besides allowing for precise 
detection of movement onset due to an initial upward movement, muscle artefacts were kept 
at a minimum by initiating the jump with the toe extensors (the most distant muscles from the 
EEG recording sites).  
 
Portable electroencephalography (EEG) and signal processing 
For EEG recordings, a wireless and portable 8-channel EEG system (LiveAmp®, Brain 
Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) in combination with an active electrode system 
(actiCAP®, Brain Products GmbH) was used. EEG was recorded from eight conventional 
recording sites (Fz, FC1, FC2, C3, Cz, C4, CP1, CP2 according to international 10/20 system). 
Ground and reference electrodes were placed at Fpz and the mastoid, respectively. 
Impedance of all electrodes was kept below 5 kΩ to ensure high EEG signal quality. For 
precise detection of movement onset, a three-axis acceleration sensor (± 2 g) was used. The 
EEG amplifier and acceleration sensor [dimensions (w x d x h): 83 x 51 x 14 mm, overall 
weight: approx. 60 g (incl. built-in battery)] were fixed to the jumper’s occiput using customized 
electrode caps (EasyCap®, Herrsching, Germany), adhesive tape and an elastic net dressing. 
Besides allowing for EEG recordings for up to 3 hours, the system transmitted the recorded 
signals wirelessly via Bluetooth to a signal processing unit (Sony Vaio Duo 13® equipped with 
an Intel Core i7® processor). EEG and accelerometer data were sampled at 250 Hz and band-
pass-filtered at 0.1 to 3 and 5 Hz, respectively. EEG signals recorded from Cz before each 
jump (defined as trial) were time locked to the onset of an accelerometer signal exceeding the 
95 % confidence interval recorded during movement preparation at rest (defined as detected 
movement onset) (Fig. 2B) and then epoched into 3-second windows. Epochs ranged from -
2.5 s to +0.5 s with a baseline correction relative to the first 0.5 s (reference window). Epochs 
with non-physiological signal amplitudes exceeding ±100 µV or large drifts before detected 
movement onset were excluded from further analysis.  
 
Outcome measures and statistics 
Successful detection of a BP was defined as negative deflection of the EEG signal 400 ms 
before movement onset across all trials7. The BP onset was defined as time point the averaged

EEG signal evidenced a continuous negative deflection for more than 500 ms. Statistical 
differences between BP onsets were assessed using the Mann-Whitney-U test. Similarity of 
waveform was defined as a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of higher than 0.6 (i.e. 
strong correlation) when comparing BPs recorded before bungee jumping and 1-meter block 
jumping. Significance level was set to p = .05 for all analyses.

Fig. 1A: Reverse-computation („Rückwärtsanalyse“) of electroencephalographic (EEG) 
signals before self-initiated voluntary finger movements (right index finger flexion) evidenced 
a negative potential shift beginning approximately 1.5 s before finger movement-related 
electromyographic (EMG) activity could be detected. This characteristic EEG signal was 
termed „Bereitschaftspotential“ (BP) (in engl. also readiness potential) by Kornhuber and 
Deecke 3 and provided first important insights to the neural origins of self-initiated acts3,4 
(superposition of 6 experiments of the same subject at 6 different days with 250 trials each, 
i.e. 1500 self-initiated finger movements (right index finger flexion) of the same subject B.L., 
adapted from Deecke, et al. 28). 1B: Subjects had to sit still in a Faraday cage with the head 
reclined into a headrest to avoid EEG artefact (photograph from the original experimental setup 
used in Kornhuber and Deecke 3, provided by Lüder Deecke, Austria). 
 
Fig. 2A. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings before 192-meter bungee jumping 
evidenced a negative potential shift over the vertex electrode (Cz) with the characteristic 
features of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) (orange: jumper 1, blue: jumper 2; average over all 
trials). The 95 % confidence interval is illustrated as orange and blue shaded areas, 
respectively. 2B: Movement onset before bungee jumping was detected by an accelerometer 
integrated into the EEG system. The solid line shows the averaged accelerometer signal 
across all trials of both jumpers. The 95 % confidence interval is indicted by the shaded areas. 
Reverse-computation of the pre-bungee jumping BPs was time-locked to the detected 
movement onset. 2C: One of the semi-professional cliff divers in pre-bungee jumping posture. 
192-meter bungee jumps were initiated by coming up on the toes and bending forward. The 
EEG system was attached to the jumper’s occiput using a customized electrode cap 
(EasyCap®, Herrsching, Germany), adhesive tape and an elastic net dressing.
