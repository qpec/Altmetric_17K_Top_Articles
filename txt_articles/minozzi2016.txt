ABSTRACT
Background: During archaeological excavation, carried out in the S. Francesco Monastery at Lucca (Tuscany, Italy), a
golden dental appliance was discovered. The prosthesis was found, together with commingled human remains, in the
collective tomb of the aristocratic family of the Guinigi, a powerful family who governed Lucca from 1392 until 1429.
The exact archaeological dating of the prosthesis was not possible, but some elements suggest a dating to the beginning
of the 17th century.
Purpose: Aim of the paper is to study and describe the dental appliance trough a multidisciplinary approach.
Materials and Methods: Macroscopical and micro-CT examinations were performed to investigate the technics used for
the realization of the dental prosthesis. SEM analysis was performed to study alloy composition of the metallic fixing
lamina and microstructure of the deposits on the dental surface.
Results: The dental prosthesis consists in five mandibular teeth: three central incisors and two lateral canines linked
together by a golden band inserted into the dental roots to replace the anterior arch of the jaw. Micro-CT scan revealed
the presence of two small golden pins inserted into each tooth crossing the root and fixing the teeth to the internal gold
band. SEM examination of the lamina indicated a homogeneous composition, with average contents of 73 wt% gold,
15.6 wt% Ag, and 11.4 wt% Cu. Apposition of dental calculus on the teeth indicated that the prosthesis had been worn
for a long period.
Conclusions: This dental prosthesis provides a unique finding of technologically advanced dentistry in this period. In
fact, during the Early Modern Age, some authors described gold band technology for the replacement of missing teeth;
nevertheless, no direct evidences of these devices have been brought to light up so far.

INTRODUCTION
Archaeological investigations carried out in the S.
Francesco Monastery at Lucca (Tuscany) in 2010,
unearthed the burials of the aristocratic members of
the Guinigi, a powerful family of traders and bankers,
who in 1392 took the power and governed the city
until 1429.
In 1358 Francesco di Bartolomeo Guinigi, uncle
of the more famous Paolo Guinigi, commissioned the
construction of the Guinigi Chapel near the cloister
of the convent of S. Francesco, which was used as a
private funerary chapel between the end of the 14th
and the first half of the 17th century.
The bodies of the Guinigi were buried together in
two large stone tombs, in which the skeletal remains of
successive inhumations were accumulated over the years.
The most part of the skeletons underwent relocations
and lost the anatomic connection, so that it was impos-
sible to provide single individual reconstructions.
During the archaeological excavations, a golden
dental appliance was discovered together with the

 commingled bones of the Guinigi, providing a unique
finding of technologically advanced dentistry in this peri-
od. In fact, during the Early Modern Age, some authors
described gold band technology for the replacement of
missing teeth; nevertheless, no direct evidences of these
devices have been brought to light up so far.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The prosthesis was found with commingled human
remains in the lower stratigraphic layer (US1278) of
one of the two collective tombs named “Cassone Sud,”
and may be dated back to the early years of utilization
of the tomb, at the end of 14th century. The exact
archaeological dating of the prosthesis was not possible
because some alterations occurred over the centuries,
as the device might have slid down from the upper
layers. In fact, some pottery fragments and devotional
medals found in the same stratigraphic layer were dat-
ed to the beginning of the 17th century.
Macroscopical and microscopical examination of
the prosthesis was performed to Stereomicroscope
WILD 10-64 X magnification.
An IRIS micro-CT scanner (Inviscan Sas, Stras-
bourg, France) allowed to investigate, nondestructive-
ly,
the
internal
structure
of
the
prosthesis.1
A
tomography acquisition was performed by means of a
high-resolution setup with the following settings: 80
kVp, 1 mA, 2000 projections over 360 degrees, with a
total scan time of 102 seconds. Images were recon-
structed using a cone-beam-filtered backprojection
algorithm, with an isotropic voxel size of 58.9 micron.
The raw projection data were manually prefiltered to
attenuate the metal artifacts in the reconstructed
images. Three-dimensional volume renderings were
performed using VolView 3.4 (Kitware Inc., USA).
Preliminary studies were carried out to investigate
the teeth surface deposits and on the alloy composi-
tion of the metallic fixing lamina by a ZEISS-EVO
MA15 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped

DESCRIPTION
The dental prosthesis consists of five teeth linked
together by a golden band (Figure 1), which was real-
ized using mandibular teeth to replace the anterior
arch of the jaw. The teeth employed were three cen-
tral incisors and two lateral canines, from right to
left: right canine, left second incisor, two right central
incisors, and left canine. Therefore, in this order, the
correct anatomical sequence was not respected. Fur-
thermore, the size and symmetry of the tooth shapes

 indicated
that
the
teeth
belonged
to
different
individuals.
Macroscopical
and
micro-CT
examination
revealed the method used for the realization of the
dental prosthesis. The appliance was 62 mm long. In
each tooth, the root apex was removed by cutting
and rubbing the root, as testified by small furrows
and wear facets visible at stereomicroscope (Figure 2).
A longitudinal cut was made in mesiodistal direction
along the root. The section was 7.6 mm long and
0.5 mm large, reaching the tooth neck. The teeth
were
then
aligned
and
a
subtle
golden
lamina,
3.5 mm large and 0.4 mm thick, was inserted into the
fissure (Figure 2).
Two small holes (0.8 mm large), one above the
other, and therefore poorly adjusted, were made in
each tooth, roughly in the middle of the root under
the neck. The holes, barely visible macroscopically,
were clearly revealed by micro-CT, in the same way as
the small pins inserted into each hole, which crossed
the root and fixed the teeth to the internal gold band
(Figure 3). The pins departed from the lingual surface
crossing the root and the golden plate, without perfo-
rating the buccal surface of the root. The juxtaposi-
tion of the dental calculus on the lingual surfaces
covered the holes (Figure 4), which could only be
seen by CT-scan examination. The traces of the calcu-
lus indicate that the prosthesis had been worn for a
long period.
The preparation of the replacement teeth also
included modifications of the tooth crowns through
abrasion of the lingual surface: in the right canine
(first tooth on the right in lingual view) the most
part of the lingual surface enamel was rubbed, uncov-
ering the underlying dentine, as testified by parallel
microstriations visible in 8x magnification. Similar
wear facet and microwear pattern were observed in
the tooth neck of the left canine (Figure 4).
The gold band had fallen out of the two lateral
teeth of the prosthesis with S-shaped ends. In the
extremity plate, two similar holes (0.8 mm diameter)
intended to provide the anchor with the mandibular
teeth still in situ, probably with strings. It was not
possible to ascertain the anchor teeth, probably the
first premolars, because any attempt to discover the
mandible fitting with the prosthesis in the Cassone
Sud tomb was unsuccessful.
SEM examination of the golden lamina was per-
formed on the right S-shaped end (Figure 5). All
SEM images were obtained by using backscattered
electrons (BSE) and, consequently, they also contain
compositional information. This is because heavy
atoms with high atomic number Z are more strongly
scattered than the light ones and the resulting image
contrast (different grey levels) is related to the average
atomic number of surface atoms. In Figure 5A, the
presence of dark-colored deposits (very rich of light
atoms) is evident and is believed to be dental calcu-
lus. In fact, the relevant x-ray spectrum in Figure 5B
evidences a massive presence of phosphorus, calcium,
and oxygen, indicative of calcium phosphates, togeth-
er with significant amounts of magnesium, alumini-
um, silicon, potassium, iron, and copper, which are
usually present in the dental calculus. Abundant

 calculus deposits were also found on the tooth surfa-
ces. By comparison, Figure 5C shows the x-ray spec-
trum from a calculus-free region on the golden
lamina: the presence of whiter and darker regions
could indicate significant differences in the local
chemical compositions, since those regions are richer
in heavier atoms, such as gold. As a matter of fact,
the whiter regions show large amounts of gold, silver,
and copper typically below 6 wt%. On the contrary,
darker regions were richer in less noble elements,
with variable amounts of Ag-Cu, each element rang-
ing up to 10 wt%. The heterogeneous composition of
the lamina surface could result from the partial disso-
lution of less noble Cu-Ag elements resulting from
the corrosion processes over time. In order to verify
this hypothesis, the S-shaped end of the lamina was

 slightly abraded by using SiC grinding paper Grit
1200, and repeating the EDS analysis on the polished
surface. As shown in Figure 6, after removal of the
surface layers, the lamina surface appeared homoge-
neous in composition, with average contents of 73
wt% gold, 15.60 wt% Ag, and 11.40 wt% Cu.
SEM examination was also carried out on the
metallic pins used to fix the teeth to the gold band.
Figure 7A shows the lingual surface of the central
incisor with massive presence of calculus deposits all
around the pinhole. EDS measurements on the exter-
nal surface of the pin gave evidenced a thick external
deposit mainly formed by lead (Figure 7B), which in
turn was almost totally covered by sulphur/oxygen-
rich copper precipitates (Figure 7C). This evidence
might be the consequence of the selective dissolution
of copper from the gold alloy lamina, with the less
subsequent redeposition on less noble lead metals,
thus contributing to the formation of the copper-rich
green patina visible on the teeth surfaces. Further

 studies are currently underway to better clarify the
nature and constitution of the lead deposit onto the
fixing pins.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Dentistry has evolved over time from a rather barbar-
ic practice to a technologically advanced industry,
and even early civilizations recognized the benefits of
tooth replacement with different kinds of appliances.
Many examples of dental appliances derive from
Etruscan contexts over 2,500 years ago and the tech-
nological practice was described by ancient literary
sources from Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, but
material evidences are scarce.2–6
Already in the 14th century, Guy de Chauliac
(1300–1368) described the replacement of lost teeth
with those of another person or with artificial teeth
made from oxbone, which may be fixed in place by a
fine metal ligature. He claimed that such a device
could last over time.7
The most important texts describing dental appli-
ances are the books by Ambroise Pare
` (1510–1590) and
especially the one by Pierre Fauchard (1678–1761), who
is considered the father of modern dentistry.
Pare
` prescribes the use of artificial teeth made of
bone or ivory to replace lost anterior teeth in order
to correct deformity and pronunciation of the mouth.
The artificial teeth should be joined together and to
the natural teeth with a thread of gold or silver or
with a common thread of silk or flax.8
Pierre Fauchard described more in detail the pro-
cess by which artificial or natural teeth could be used
for the replacement of multiple teeth.9 Fauchard’s
technique consisted in producing holes in the pros-
thetic teeth and fixing them to a gold band posi-
tioned anteriorly and posteriorly
through simple
threads. Fauchard claimed the longevity of restora-
tions by this technique: “Teeth and artificial dentures,
fastened with posts and gold wire, hold better than
all others. They sometimes last 15–20 years and even
more without displacement. Common thread and
silk, used ordinarily to attach all kinds of teeth or
artificial pieces, do not last long.”10
Figure 8 shows the Pare
` and Fauchard applian-
ces to hold loose teeth in place: they were made by
two gold bands on the lingual and buccal surfaces,
and
were
blocked
inside
the
teeth with
simple
strings. The Guinigi prosthesis seems more complex
because the gold lamina ran inside the dental roots
and the teeth were blocked with golden pins, com-
pared to that of Fauchard in Figure 8. Moreover,
the Guinigi prosthesis was anchored to the teeth
still in situ through the lateral S-shaped ends, prob-
ably fixed with strings.

` (1579) on the left and Fauchard (1746) on the right.

 In conclusion, although the medical texts of the
Early Modern Age describe the use of the gold band
technology to replace missing teeth, no direct evi-
dence of such a device has been found so far. There-
fore, the dental prosthesis found in the multiple tomb
of the Guinigi family provides the first archaeological
evidence of a dental prosthesis in this period.
