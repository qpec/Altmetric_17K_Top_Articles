Abstract
Evidence derived from human clinical studies and experimental animal models shows a
causal relationship between adverse pregnancy and increased cardiovascular disease in
the adult offspring. However, translational studies isolating mechanisms to design interven-
tion are lacking. Sheep and humans share similar precocial developmental milestones in
cardiovascular anatomy and physiology. We tested the hypothesis in sheep that maternal
treatment with antioxidants protects against fetal growth restriction and programmed hyper-
tension in adulthood in gestation complicated by chronic fetal hypoxia, the most common
adverse consequence in human pregnancy. Using bespoke isobaric chambers, chronically
catheterized sheep carrying singletons underwent normoxia or hypoxia (10% oxygen [O2]) ±
vitamin C treatment (maternal 200 mg.kg−1 IV daily) for the last third of gestation. In one
cohort, the maternal arterial blood gas status, the value at which 50% of the maternal hemo-
globin is saturated with oxygen (P50), nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, oxidative stress, and
antioxidant capacity were determined. In another, naturally delivered offspring were raised
under normoxia until early adulthood (9 months). Lambs were chronically instrumented and
cardiovascular function tested in vivo. Following euthanasia, femoral arterial segments were
isolated and endothelial function determined by wire myography. Hypoxic pregnancy
induced fetal growth restriction and fetal oxidative stress. At adulthood, it programmed
hypertension by enhancing vasoconstrictor reactivity and impairing NO-independent endo-
thelial function. Maternal vitamin C in hypoxic pregnancy improved transplacental oxygen-
ation and enhanced fetal antioxidant capacity while increasing NO bioavailability, offsetting
constrictor hyper-reactivity and replenishing endothelial function in the adult offspring.
These discoveries provide novel insight into mechanisms and interventions against fetal
growth restriction and adult-onset programmed hypertension in an animal model of compli-
cated pregnancy in a species of similar temporal developmental milestones to humans.

 Author summary
Adverse conditions during pregnancy can increase the cardiovascular risk of the adult off-
spring. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear, precluding the
identification of candidate therapy. In this interventional study in sheep, a species of simi-
lar temporal developmental milestones to humans, we adopt an integrative approach,
combining studies in vivo with those at the isolated organ, cellular, and molecular levels
to investigate consequences of suboptimal pregnancy on the offspring at two stages of life:
in the near-term fetus and in the adult. We show that developmental hypoxia, the most
common outcome in human suboptimal pregnancy, slows fetal growth and programs
high blood pressure in the sheep adult offspring. Maternal treatment with vitamin C in
hypoxic pregnancy restored fetal growth and protected against adult-onset hypertension
by improving transplacental oxygen delivery, enhancing fetal antioxidant capacity, and
increasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) in the sheep adult offspring. Our discov-
eries highlight that when considering strategies to reduce the overall burden of heart dis-
ease, a much greater attention to prevention rather than treatment is required. Treatment
should start as early as possible during the developmental trajectory, rather than waiting
until adulthood when the disease process has become irreversible.
Introduction
Cardiovascular disease kills 1 in 3 people [1]. The annual costs for patient care and lost work-
force due to heart disease are over US$130 billion in the United States and Canada [2] and
over £30 billion in the United Kingdom [3]. Therefore, cardiovascular disease is a significant
problem imposing a substantial burden on every nation’s health and wealth [4]. It is widely
accepted that our genes interact with traditional lifestyle factors, such as smoking, obesity,
and/or a sedentary lifestyle, to promote an increased risk of cardiovascular disease [5]. It is
also established that the gene–environment interaction early in life may be just as, if not more,
important in “programming” heart health and heart disease [6–8]. Evidence from human sib-
ling-pair studies suggests that these relationships are causal, that they occur independently of
genotype, and that they are significantly influenced by the quality of the intrauterine environ-
ment during pregnancy [9–12]. For instance, studies in Pima Indians showed a greater preva-
lence of type 2 diabetes in siblings born from pregnancies during which the mother had
gestational diabetes compared to those whose mother did not [9]. Bariatric surgery to decrease
the weight of obese women reduced the risk of obesity, insulin resistance, and raised blood
pressure in children born after surgery compared to those born before surgery [10–12]. There-
fore, these studies highlight a disproportionate risk of disease in offspring born from the same
mother but under different in utero conditions, providing strong evidence in humans that the
environment experienced during this critical period of development directly influences long-
term cardiovascular health.
One of the most common outcomes of complicated pregnancy in humans is chronic fetal
hypoxia leading to reduced fetal growth, as can occur during placental insufficiency, pre-
eclampsia, or inflammatory conditions during pregnancy, such as in chorioamnionitis, gesta-
tional diabetes, or maternal obesity [13,14]. In humans, low birth weight is related to poor
neonatal outcome [15] and endothelial dysfunction [16] and high blood pressure at adulthood
[17]. In turn, increased blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease [18], with this risk being greatest in those who were smallest at birth but with the most
accelerated weight gain in childhood [19]. To date, there is no cure for pregnancy complicated

 by chronic fetal hypoxia to protect against fetal growth restriction or programmed cardiovas-
cular dysfunction in the offspring. Treatment options are restricted to monitoring surrogate
measures of fetal hypoxia and fetal growth, ultimately ending up in elective delivery of the off-
spring [20]. This highlights the need for experimental studies addressing underlying mecha-
nisms to identify plausible intervention.
Studies in animal models of adverse pregnancy have confirmed causality, reporting that
oxidative stress during complicated pregnancy, including one involving chronic fetal hypoxia,
may be a potential underlying mechanism [8,21–31]. Chronic fetal hypoxia is a powerful stim-
ulus for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [8]. Under physiologic conditions, ROS are
important mediators of a wide variety of cell functions, for instance, via signaling or by inter-
acting with nitric oxide (NO) to provide a vascular oxidant tone [32–34]. However, excessive
ROS and/or a fall in antioxidant defenses can lead to cellular oxidative stress and a fall in the
bioavailability of NO, predisposing to cardiovascular dysfunction [8,31]. A small cluster of
investigations including our own, mostly through studies of isolated hearts and vessels or
echocardiography in rodents, has provided evidence for possible intervention with maternal
treatment with antioxidants to protect against the ill effects of hypoxic pregnancy on the off-
spring [28–31,35,36]. However, when working with animal models of cardiovascular dysfunc-
tion before birth, the temporal profile of cardiovascular development between species is a
highly important consideration for successful interventional translation to the human clinical
situation. Rodents are altricial species, in which cardiovascular maturation continues past
birth, becoming completed by the second week of postnatal life [28]. In contrast, sheep and
humans share similar prenatal tempos of cardiovascular development [28] and some breeds of
sheep, like Welsh Mountain, give birth primarily to singleton lambs of similar weight to term
human babies. To date, no study has addressed maternal antioxidant intervention to protect
against systemic cardiovascular dysfunction in the adult offspring in a human translational
model of hypoxic pregnancy, such as in sheep, which additionally permits detailed cardiovas-
cular analysis of in vivo mechanisms of action.
In the present study, we tested the antioxidant vitamin C, as it is widely supplemented in
human populations. In an elegant study, Jackson and colleagues [37] reported that the capacity
of the antioxidant vitamin C to scavenge O2
− ex vivo and its ability to prevent O2
−-induced
impairment of endothelial function in vivo occurred at very different concentrations, requir-
ing a much higher effective concentration in vivo. Therefore, the dose regimen used in the pre-
set study was derived from previous studies in our laboratory, which achieved elevations in
circulating ascorbate within the required range for vitamin C to act effectively in vivo in ovine
pregnancy [33,34]. To put into context, the dose of vitamin C used in the present study was 8
times higher than the dose employed in human clinical trials to prevent preeclampsia [38].
Here, we tested the hypothesis using Welsh Mountain sheep that maternal treatment with vita-
min C protects against fetal growth restriction and programmed hypertension in adulthood
in gestation complicated by chronic fetal hypoxia. While experimental models, which affect
uterine blood flow or placental function, impair both fetal nutrition and fetal oxygenation, the
isolated effect of chronic hypoxia on the fetus can be best studied by exposing the ovine preg-
nancy to an environment of reduced oxygenation. We therefore created 4 isobaric chambers
[39,40] able to maintain pregnant sheep for long periods of gestation (Fig 1A). Adopting an
integrative approach at the in vivo, isolated organ, and molecular levels, we show that maternal
treatment with vitamin C in ovine hypoxic pregnancy protects against both fetal growth
restriction and hypertension in the adult offspring. Mechanisms underlying this antioxidant
protection include improved transplacental oxygenation, enhanced endogenous antioxidant
capacity, increased in vivo NO bioavailability, offset in vivo vasoconstrictor hyper-reactivity,
and replenished endothelial function in the peripheral vasculature of the offspring (see

 Summary illustration, Fig 2). By studying a species of similar developmental milestones to
humans, the study therefore presents a conceptual advance to this field of research. It allows
not only in vivo investigation of basal and stimulated cardiovascular physiology in the chroni-
cally instrumented adult offspring in an animal model that closely recapitulates human preg-
nancies involving fetal oxygen insufficiency, but it also provides a spring board toward human
clinical translation, offering viable treatment options for the developmental origins of
hypertension.
Results
Prenatal hypoxia ± antioxidant treatment: Effects on the mother, placenta,
and fetus
In control ewes undergoing normoxic pregnancy, maternal arterial blood gases and pH
remained unaltered from baseline until 135 days of gestation (dGA) (Fig 1B–1D and Table 1).
However, in these ewes, there was a significant increase in maternal bicarbonate (HCO3
−) on
Fig 2. Summary illustration. Hypoxic pregnancy in sheep increases fetal oxidative stress, reduces fetal growth, and programs NO-independent endothelial dysfunction,
vasoconstrictor hyper-reactivity, and hypertension in the adult offspring. Maternal treatment with vitamin C in hypoxic pregnancy increases transplacental oxygenation
and fetal antioxidant capacity. This protects fetal growth and restores NO bioavailability, normalizing peripheral vascular function and arterial blood pressure in the
adult offspring.

 PaO2 and arterial blood percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (Sat Hb) (Fig 1B–
1D). Chronic hypoxia in untreated ewes led to a transient maternal respiratory alkalosis, with
significant falls in maternal arterial blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) through-
out exposure and a significant increase in maternal pH at 106 dGA, the day after the onset of
hypoxia (Table 1). This maternal respiratory alkalosis was buffered by reductions in maternal
HCO3
− throughout the chronic hypoxia period (Table 1). In contrast to control ewes undergo-
ing normoxic pregnancy, ewes exposed to chronic hypoxia did not show a significant fall from
baseline in maternal [Hb] and levels of maternal [Hb] were significantly higher than those in
control ewes from 110 dGA (Table 1). Maternal hypoxia in untreated ewes enhanced the onto-
genic increase in maternal plasma NOx (Fig 1E), and it did not affect maternal food intake or
maternal weight gain (Fig 1F and 1G).
Maternal vitamin C treatment in both control and hypoxic ewes produced similar incre-
ments from baseline (N: 38.0 ± 3.9; H: 36.2 ± 3.1 μmol/L) in maternal plasma vitamin C, dou-
bling the circulating concentration (Fig 1H). Maternal vitamin C treatment in hypoxic
pregnancy did not affect the alterations in maternal blood gases or pH or maternal plasma
NOx seen in untreated hypoxic ewes. In addition, ewes undergoing hypoxia treated with vita-
min C also did not show any changes in maternal food intake (Fig 1B–1F and Table 1). How-
ever, maternal treatment with vitamin C in hypoxic pregnancy led to a greater fall in maternal
Sat Hb despite a similar fall in maternal PaO2 compared to untreated ewes (Fig 1C and 1D).
This meant a rightward shift in the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve and thereby a sig-
nificant increase in the maternal arterial P50 from 23.5 ± 0.9 to 26.6 ± 10 mmHg (P < 0.05; Fig
1I). The total number of placentomes, the placental weight, the fetal:placental weight ratio, and
the distribution of placentome type did not differ among all 4 groups (see S1A–S1C Fig).
Fetuses from hypoxic pregnancy showed growth restriction with brain sparing. They had a
significant reduction in body weight, body mass index (BMI), and lower limb length (LLL)
and significant increases in the absolute and relative brain weight, in the relative weight of the
hypothalamus, the absolute weight of the cerebral hemispheres, and in the ratio of the biparie-
tal diameter relative to LLL when compared to fetuses from normoxic pregnancy (Table 2 and
Fig 3A–3F). Fetuses from hypoxic pregnancy showed an increase in [Hb] and in plasma total
NOx (Fig 3G and 3H). They also had increased hepatic nitrotyrosine concentrations and
decreases in plasma homocysteine and in the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase
(SOD) in the liver (Fig 3I–3L).
Fetuses from hypoxic pregnancy treated with maternal vitamin C no longer showed signifi-
cant reductions in body weight and BMI, no longer showed a significant increase in relative
brain weight, and the ratio of the biparietal diameter relative to LLL was restored when com-
pared to fetuses from normoxic pregnancy. However, the reduction in LLL and the increase in
the relative weight of the hypothalamus persisted (Table 2 and Fig 3A–3F). Fetuses from hyp-
oxic pregnancy treated with maternal vitamin C still showed an increase in [Hb] and total
plasma NOx and a fall in liver SOD, and the increase in hepatic nitrotyrosine was significantly
greater than in fetuses from untreated hypoxic pregnancy. However, they showed restored lev-
els of plasma homocysteine and of hepatic catalase activity when compared to hypoxic fetuses
of untreated pregnancy (Table 2 and Fig 3J and 3K).
Maternal treatment with vitamin C in normoxic pregnancy had no effect on any outcome
variable measured in the ewes or fetuses when compared to untreated normoxic pregnancy
(Tables 1 and 2, Figs 1 and 3).
When blood was taken at post mortem immediately following the end of the experiment at
138 dGA, the fetal plasma concentrations of cortisol were not different among all groups (N:
17.6 ± 3.0; H: 16.6 ± 2.9; HC: 27.7 ± 2.9; NC: 28.5 ± 6.2 ng.mL−1). We have also reported that

 in fields surrounding the Barcroft Centre at the University of Cambridge. Lambs from hypoxic
pregnancy were born earlier in gestation (N: 147.4 ± 0.6 versus H: 143.6 ± 0.6 days, P < 0.05)
with a reduced birth weight (N: 3.5 ± 0.1 versus H: 2.9 ± 0.1 Kg, P < 0.05). Despite being born
lighter, lambs from hypoxic pregnancy showed accelerated postnatal fractional growth rates
(N: 25.1 ± 1.2 versus H: 32.4 ± 1.8 mg.d−1, starting weight−1, P < 0.05), such that body weight
at 9 months was no longer different (N: 26.5 ± 1.2 versus H: 30.4 ± 1.7 Kg). There were also no
differences in the weight of the brain, heart, and liver nor in the weight of components of the
brain, such as the hemispheres, hypothalamus, or cerebellum between lambs from normoxic
or hypoxic pregnancy at 9 months (Table 2).
In vivo experiments in chronically instrumented 9-month-old lambs revealed that offspring
from hypoxic pregnancy were hypertensive, and they showed greater resting values for femoral
blood flow and vascular conductance (Fig 4A–4F). Addressing in vivo mechanisms contribut-
ing to the hypertension, adult offspring of hypoxic pregnancy showed enhanced in vivo femo-
ral constrictor responses to phenylephrine (PE) and to angiotensin II (AngII). They also
showed enhanced in vivo femoral dilator responses to sodium nitroprusside (SNP), with no
significant effect on basal femoral vascular resistance of N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester

 (L-NAME) treatment (Fig 4G–4J). To further address mechanisms, third order femoral vessels
isolated from adult offspring of hypoxic pregnancy showed reduced relaxation to methacho-
line because of endothelial dysfunction due to a decrease in NO-independent mechanisms,
including prostanoid and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) dilator reactiv-
ity (Fig 4K and 4L).
Adult offspring of hypoxic pregnancy treated with maternal vitamin C were no longer
hypertensive (Fig 4A–4C); they showed a significant increase in femoral vascular resistance
following L-NAME treatment, indicating greater circulating NO bioavailability (Fig 4J), and
had constrictor and dilator responses in vivo and ex vivo, which were more similar to adult off-
spring of control pregnancy (Fig 4G–4L). The weight of organs collected at 9 months was simi-
lar in adult offspring from treated and untreated hypoxic pregnancies (Table 2).
Adult offspring of normoxic pregnancy treated with vitamin C showed similar responses in
all outcomes relative to offspring of untreated normoxic pregnancy, with the exception of
reduced endothelial function in isolated femoral vessels (Table 2 and Fig 4L).
Discussion
Any pregnancy in which there is an increase in placental vascular resistance will impact oxygen
delivery to the fetus. Therefore, chronic fetal hypoxia is one of the most common complica-
tions of human pregnancy and is known to cause fetal growth restriction [13,14]. Recently, we
created isobaric chambers able to maintain pregnant sheep for long periods of gestation under
highly controlled hypoxic conditions [39,40]. We have used this novel technology to model the
short- and longer-term effects of isolated hypoxic pregnancy on the cardiovascular system of
the offspring in a species of similar temporal developmental milestones to humans.
Hypoxic pregnancy, fetal growth, and fetal brain sparing
During healthy pregnancy, maternal cardiovascular adaptations are essential to maintain
appropriate fetal growth and development as well as the maternal well-being. These adapta-
tions include the expansion of the maternal blood volume, which places the mother in a state
of physiological anemia. Following Poiseuille’s Law, reductions in maternal [Hb] decrease the
maternal blood viscosity, thereby promoting lower systemic vascular resistance and increased
blood flow in the uteroplacental circulation to match fetal growth in the last third of pregnancy
[41,42]. Therefore, the fall in maternal [Hb] in control ewes in the present study is consistent
with healthy maternal adaptations during late gestation. In humans and sheep, exposure to
hypoxia during pregnancy, such as that associated with high altitude, leads to a fall in the
maternal PaO2 and PaCO2 and an increase in maternal [Hb] [42–44]. In human high-altitude
pregnancy, there is also an increase in the maternal blood pH and a decrease in HCO3
− aiming
to buffer the maternal alkalosis [43,44]. Therefore, the maternal circulatory responses to
vivo stimulated femoral blood flow and femoral vascular conductance responses to 4G, PE; 4H, Ang II; and 4I, SNP. 4J. Femoral vascular

 chronic hypoxia in the present study are consistent with these maternal adaptations to hypoxic
pregnancy, and they explain the significantly higher levels of maternal [Hb] and lack of a fall
in maternal [Hb] with advancing gestation in the chronically hypoxic relative to the normoxic
ewe.
Fetuses of hypoxic pregnancy were not only lighter but also showed a reduced BMI with an
increase in relative brain weight. These are robust indices of fetal brain sparing at the expense
of redistribution of blood flow away from the fetal peripheral circulation [14]. Regional differ-
ences in brain weight changes suggest that the hypothalamus and cerebellum were preserved
more so than the hemispheres. Seminal studies in fetal sheep have previously reported a hierar-
chy in maintaining blood flow to subcortical regions at the expense of blood flow to the brain
hemispheres during chronic hypoxia [45]. In a separate study, we have previously reported
that a comparative level of maternal hypoxia in sheep, as used in the present study, reduced
the fetal PaO2 from normal baseline to values of 12 ± 1 mmHg [40]. This is of significant clini-
cal translation, as this is the level of reduced fetal oxygenation measured by cordocentesis in
human pregnancies complicated by significant fetal growth restriction [46].
Hypoxic pregnancy and oxidative stress in the fetal cardiovascular system
Additional data in the present study show that increased oxidative stress in the fetus contrib-
utes to the mechanisms mediating the adverse consequences of developmental hypoxia.
3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) is a product of protein tyrosine nitration following oxidative damage to
proteins by peroxynitrie [47]. An increase in oxidative stress will cause an increased demand
for the synthesis of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, a decrease in the activities of
hepatic catalase and SOD in fetuses from hypoxic pregnancy provides further evidence of
increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defenses in the hypoxic fetus in the present
study.
It is widely recognized that individuals with high-plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels have
an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease [48]. However, it must also be recog-
nized that Hcy is an important intermediate in the conversion of methionine to cysteine,
which is then used in the production of the antioxidant glutathione. During an oxidative chal-
lenge, this pathway is up-regulated rapidly [48,49]. However, in situations of low Hcy, there is
a limit to how much glutathione can be produced, thereby restricting the body’s ability to
respond to oxidative stress [49]. Any condition that causes an increase in oxidative stress will
promote an increased demand on the liver to produce glutathione, and consequently, low
availability of glutathione and homocysteine is also associated with a large range of diseases
[49]. In hypoxic pregnancies, oxidative stress will drive Hcy into glutathione synthesis, leading
to a fall in plasma Hcy levels, as was observed with the hypoxic fetuses in the present study.
These data in the sheep fetus are also in keeping with reports of oxidative stress in the fetal car-
diovascular system in rodent models of hypoxic pregnancy [8,28–31,35,36].
In the present study, treatment of hypoxic pregnancies with vitamin C maintained the
increase in fetal [Hb], and in fetal total plasma NOx, it augmented the increase in nitrotyrosine
in the fetal liver but prevented the fall in the fetal hepatic activities of Hcy and catalase without
affecting the reduction in SOD in the fetus of hypoxic relative to normoxic pregnancy. Main-
tained or augmented increases in fetal [Hb], fetal total plasma NOx, and in nitrotyrosine in the
fetal liver in hypoxic pregnancy suggests that maternal treatment with vitamin C is not protec-
tive in hypoxic pregnancy by affecting oxygen sensing pathways, the induction of oxidative
stress, or compensatory adaptations to increase NO bioavailability in the fetus. Rather, mater-
nal treatment with vitamin C in hypoxic pregnancy confers antioxidant protection by addi-
tional exogenous antioxidant supplementation. This normalizes the fetal hepatic activities of
Intervention for hypertension programmed by prenatal hypoxia

12 / 27
 Hcy and catalase but not SOD, thereby reducing the demand for 2 out of 3 fetal endogenous
antioxidant defenses in hypoxic pregnancy.
Maternal vitamin C protects fetal growth and prevents programmed
systemic hypertension in the adult offspring in hypoxic pregnancy
Maternal vitamin C treatment increases umbilical blood flow in vivo in ovine pregnancy by
quenching O2
− production and increasing NO bioavailability [33,34]. Here, we show that
maternal vitamin C treatment additionally increases the maternal P50 and restores fetal plasma
Hcy levels and hepatic catalase activity. Therefore, maternal vitamin C treatment by increasing
umbilical blood flow, fetal endogenous antioxidant defenses, and the transplacental PO2 gradi-
ent will buffer reductions in fetal oxygen delivery despite chronic hypoxia. These mechanisms
may explain the capacity of the chronically hypoxic fetus whose mother is treated with vitamin
C to be able to maintain appropriate growth, no longer requiring fetal brain sparing. Preg-
nancy complicated by fetal growth restriction is itself a major killer in perinatal medicine
today [15]. Therefore, treatment to protect fetal growth in human high-risk pregnancy is clini-
cally important.
Systemic hypertension affects 1 billion adults worldwide [50]. Increased systolic blood pres-
sure is an independent risk factor for coronary events, stroke, and heart failure [51]. A few
studies in rodents have shown that hypoxic pregnancy can program hypertension in the adult
offspring and that this was associated with constrictor hyper-reactivity in the peripheral vascu-
lature and exacerbated cardiovascular responses to stress [52–55]. However, intervention
against the programmed hypertension was not addressed in these studies. Here, we show that
ovine pregnancy complicated by developmental hypoxia can also program significant hyper-
tension in the adult offspring. The mechanisms mediating hypertension in the present study
include increased in vivo vasoconstrictor reactivity to α-adrenergic agonists and to AngII in
the peripheral circulation. In addition, we show endothelial dysfunction due to impaired
EDHF and prostanoid-dependent reactivity in femoral arteries of adult offspring of hypoxic
pregnancy. There is also in vivo evidence of programmed compensatory increases in NO func-
tion in the cardiovascular system in adult offspring of hypoxic pregnancy. We show in vivo
that they have enhanced basal femoral blood flow and vascular conductance and a greater fem-
oral dilator response to SNP, a NO donor. In the present study, maternal vitamin C treatment
in hypoxic pregnancy prevented hypertension in the adult offspring. Therefore, we provide
novel in vivo evidence of successful intervention with antenatal maternal antioxidant adminis-
tration against programmed systemic hypertension in the adult offspring. Further, the success-
ful intervention against programmed hypertension is in an ovine model of chronic fetal
hypoxia, thereby of comparable developmental milestones to humans. In the present study,
maternal treatment with vitamin C conferred protection against hypertension in the offspring
by programming an increase in NO bioavailability, since in vivo treatment of adult offspring
with L-NAME led to significantly greater increases in femoral vascular resistance. Further,
maternal vitamin C also improved endothelial function. Combined, therefore, these protective
mechanisms induced by maternal vitamin C treatment meant that NO-compensatory
responses in the peripheral vasculature of adult offspring of hypoxic pregnancy, such as
enhanced basal femoral blood flow and vascular conductance and a greater femoral dilator
response to SNP, were no longer required.
In the present study, fetal sheep were not instrumented with catheters, as the focus was on
offspring of hypoxic pregnancy being allowed to be born naturally and maintained until adult-
hood for cardiovascular study. This study design precluded the measurement of fetal arterial
blood pressure and knowledge of whether chronic fetal hypoxia led to fetal arterial

 hypertension in utero, which was maintained or exacerbated until adulthood. However, in sep-
arate studies, which determined changes in fetal arterial blood pressure during hypoxic preg-
nancy in sheep using isobaric chambers, we [40] and others [56] have reported that the
chronically hypoxic fetus showed an impaired or unchanged ontogenic increase in basal arte-
rial blood pressure. Similarly, late-gestation fetal sheep conceived, gestated, and studied at high
altitude had lower resting arterial blood pressure relative to sea level controls [57]. Combined,
therefore, past and present evidence suggests that chronic fetal hypoxia programs adult-onset
hypertension and that this develops in association with aging, rather than it persisting from
fetal origin.
Several studies in rodents and in sheep have reported that pregnancy exposed to excess glu-
cocorticoids can also program hypertension in the adult offspring [58–62]. In the present
study, fetal plasma glucocorticoid levels were not elevated by the end of hypoxic pregnancy rel-
ative to normoxic pregnancy. This is again consistent with data derived from high-altitude
pregnancy, which reports in sheep that the fetal hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal axis desensi-
tizes in response to chronic hypoxia. This is an adaptive response to prevent stress-induced
preterm birth and to maintain normal circulating levels of fetal cortisol for appropriate devel-
opment and maturation [63]. Therefore, in the present study, chronic fetal hypoxia pro-
grammed adult-onset hypertension independent of fetal hypercostisolemia.
In the clinical setting, people are diagnosed as hypertensive when the systolic/diastolic read-
ing exceeds 140/90, with systolic blood pressure being the greatest predictor of later disease
(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] guidelines) [64]. There is no equiv-
alent definition for sheep, and although a direct comparison cannot be made, adult offspring
of hypoxic pregnancy in the present study had a mean increase in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure values of 13 and of 8 mmHg above control values, respectively. The magnitude of
these effects is of high clinical significance, as reports on the prevention and treatment of high
blood pressure in humans show that the risk of cardiovascular disease doubles with each incre-
ment of systolic/diastolic pressure of 20/10 mmHg and that such individuals require active
health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent overt cardiovascular disease [18]. The Fra-
mingham study reported that modest increases in mean blood pressure milder than those
observed in lambs from hypoxic pregnancy in the present study can dramatically increase the
risk of a future cardiovascular event [65]. A recent randomized clinical trial also reported that
targeting a systolic blood pressure to <120 mmHg compared with <140 mmHg in humans
resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events [66]. In the present study,
offspring of hypoxic pregnancy therefore already fall under the human classification of prehy-
pertensive despite being young adult and female and thereby likely to show even greater risk of
cardiovascular disease with aging.
Interestingly, adult offspring born from normoxic pregnancy treated with vitamin C also
showed evidence of endothelial dysfunction in the present study. While antioxidant supple-
mentation may benefit conditions of increased oxidative stress, antioxidant excess resulting
from antioxidant supplementation under normal conditions may paradoxically promote oxi-
dative stress [32]. One mechanism may be by providing excess NO bioavailability, which also
serves as a precursor for peroxynitrite generation [32]. This reveals an equally important trans-
lational message in the present study, and that is that clinically, maternal treatment with anti-
oxidants should only be administered to pregnancies diagnosed with chronic fetal hypoxia
rather than given prophylactically to all pregnancies. This will only be feasible if risk can be
identified prior to maternal therapy. Expert obstetric opinion today dictates that in human
pregnancy, chronic fetal hypoxia can be reliably identified according to severity by ultrasound
scan between 20–26 weeks of gestation. Diagnosis encompasses early onset intrauterine
growth restriction, reduced fetal heart rate variability and body movements and/or abnormal

 Doppler blood flow velocimetry indices in the fetal middle cerebral artery and the umbilical
circulation [67,68]. Although this supports possible translation to the human clinical setting,
there are several important points for additional discussion and further key basic science
experiments that are required to inform double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled human
clinical trials before maternal antioxidant supplementation in human obstetric practice could
be considered.
Limitations
A limitation of the current program of work is that although the study design controlled for
sex differences in the offspring, it did not address them. To make the study viable ethically and
economically, every singleton pregnancy generated was used. Therefore, studies in the fetal
period used the male offspring while studies in the adult period used the female offspring, as
ewe lambs are easier to group house when compared to growing rams. Longitudinal compari-
sons from the fetal through the adult period thus require caution.
A second limitation of the current program of work is that outcome variables in the fetal
and adult periods were not balanced for sex. Several recent reviews have reported important
sex-dependent differences in the programming effects on cardiovascular function in the adult
offspring of adverse intrauterine conditions, usually highlighting that the male offspring is
more vulnerable [69–71]. It is also well accepted that aging increases cardiovascular risk [72–
74] and that ovarian estrogens at adulthood confer protection against cardiovascular disease
[75]. Given that the present study reported significant hypertension in young adult females
born from hypoxic pregnancy, the data may underestimate the potential adverse impact of
developmental hypoxia on systemic hypertension and cardiovascular dysfunction in adult
male offspring in this ovine model of hypoxic pregnancy. However, the study does emphasize
that hypoxic pregnancy in sheep increases the risk of cardiovascular dysfunction and that
maternal antioxidant treatment is protective in both male and female offspring.
A third limitation of the current study design is that pregnancies exposed to hypoxia from
105 to 135 dGA were returned to normoxia at 135 days to allow delivery under normal oxygen
conditions. This study design ensured a fixed length period of fetal exposure to chronic hyp-
oxia prior to birth. However, it also means that adult-onset hypertension could be pro-
grammed by fetal exposure to chronic hypoxia with some reoxygenation rather than by
chronic fetal hypoxia alone. Since hypoxia and reoxygenation is a more potent stimulus of oxi-
dative stress than hypoxia alone [32], the data highlight the protective impact of maternal anti-
oxidant therapy even under these conditions.
The final limitation and perhaps the most important in terms of human clinical translation
is that multicenter human clinical studies have been unable to confirm benefits of maternal
treatment with antioxidant vitamins in pregnancies at risk of preeclampsia [38,76]. These stud-
ies include the vitamins in preeclampsia (VIP) and international trial of antioxidants in the
prevention of preeclampsia (INTAPP) trials, which found that administration of vitamin C (1
g.d−1) and E (400 IU) to mothers once clinical signs of the preeclampsia were established did
not affect the incidence of preeclampsia but instead led to an increase in the rate of low-birth
weight babies by 4%. While preeclampsia was not the focus of the present study and the
adverse effect on birth weight of maternal vitamin C in human studies appears no longer pres-
ent with meta-analysis [38,76], these clinical findings are significant enough to warn against
possible adverse side effects of maternal vitamin C treatment in human pregnancy. Hence, we
strongly agree that vitamin C may not be the antioxidant of choice for translation to human
therapy. However, the data we show provide proof-of-principle that maternal treatment with
antioxidants can protect against developmental programming of adult-onset hypertension.

 Future key experiments to inform human clinical trials should consider alternative maternal
antioxidant therapy of improved translational value using human clinically relevant animal
models of adverse pregnancy, such as sheep. Plausible alternative candidate antioxidant thera-
pies for human translation may include melatonin, allopurinol, or the mitochondria-targeted
antioxidant MitoQ. Rodent models show that maternal treatment with melatonin confers pro-
tection on fetal growth and cardiovascular function in the offspring of adverse pregnancy at
doses similar to or lower than those required to avoid jet lag in humans [77,78]. An alternative
antioxidant strategy may be to prevent the synthesis of free radicals through specific pathways
rather than quench them once formed, as in the case of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopuri-
nol. Hypoxia is a potent stimulus for xanthine oxidase-induced superoxide anion generation
[32], and recently, we have reported that maternal treatment with allopurinol in hypoxic preg-
nancy in rats protects against cardiac dysfunction in the adult offspring [79]. Yet another strat-
egy may be for targeted antioxidant therapy. Mitochondria are a major site of ROS production;
therefore, targeting them specifically should be one of the most effective antioxidant therapeutic
strategies. This is now possible with mitochondria-targeted antioxidants. MitoQ is composed of
a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation covalently attached to an ubiquinol antioxidant
[80,81]. Lipophilic cations can easily move through phospholipid bilayers without requiring a
specific uptake mechanism. Therefore, the triphenylphosphonium cation concentrates MitoQ
several hundred-fold within the mitochondria, driven by the large mitochondrial membrane
potential [78,79]. Only within the mitochondria, MitoQ is reduced by the respiratory chain to its
active ubiquinol form, which is a particularly effective antioxidant that prevents lipid peroxida-
tion and mitochondrial damage [80,81]. The benefits of MitoQ have been revealed in a range of
in vivo studies in rats and mice and in two human trials [82–85]. In contrast to vitamin C and
other conventional antioxidants, MitoQ demonstrates no pro-oxidant activity at high doses and
long-term administration to mice for 28 weeks [83] and to human patients in two Phase II trials,
one that lasted 1 year revealed no toxicity [84,85]. Two recent studies in rats have also reported
that nano-particle bound MitoQ, which prevents passage of the drug through the placenta and
to the fetus, protected against programmed cardiac diastolic dysfunction, endothelial dysfunc-
tion, and neurodegeneration in the adult offspring, using an established model of hypoxic preg-
nancy in rats [35,86]. However, the antioxidant benefits of either melatonin or allopurinol or
MitoQ in protecting against fetal growth restriction and programmed hypertension at adulthood
in offspring of high-risk pregnancy in sheep have yet to be determined.
In conclusion, our discoveries provide compelling evidence of clinical translational impor-
tance for chronic fetal hypoxia programming of adult-onset hypertension in a species of simi-
lar developmental milestones to humans. Further, the data provide novel insight into
underlying mechanisms and thereby successful intervention against cardiovascular dysfunc-
tion in the next generation programmed by pregnancy complicated by developmental hypoxia
(See Summary illustration, Fig 2).

 Zoetermeer, the Netherlands) underwent a laparotomy and catheterization, as previously
described [33,34,39,40]. In brief, under general anesthesia (1.5%–2.0% isofluorane in 60:40 O2:
N2O) maintained by use of a positive pressure ventilator (Datex-Ohmeda Ltd, Hatfield, Hert-
fordshire, UK), a midline abdominal incision and uterotomy was used to expose the fetal hind
limbs and determine fetal sex. If male, then the fetuses were assigned to the fetal studies group;
female fetuses were assigned to the adult offspring studies group. The fetus was returned into
the intrauterine cavity, and the uterine and maternal abdominal incisions were closed in layers.
A Teflon catheter (i.d. 1.0 mm, o.d. 1.6 mm, Altec, UK) was placed in the maternal femoral
artery and positioned in the descending aorta, in addition to a maternal femoral venous cathe-
ter into the inferior vena cava (Critchly Electrical Products, NSW, Australia). Catheters were
filled with heparinized saline (80 i.u.ml−1 heparin in 0.9% NaCl), tunnelled subcutaneously,
and exteriorized via a keyhole incision made in the maternal flank to be kept inside a plastic
pouch sewn onto the maternal skin.
Following surgery, ewes were housed in individual floor pens with a 12:12-hour light–dark
cycle. From 103 dGA, ewes were fed daily a bespoke maintenance diet made up of concentrate
and hay pellets to facilitate the monitoring of food intake (Cambridge ewe diet: 40g nuts/kg
and 3g hay/kg; Manor Farm Feeds Ltd; Oakham, Leicestershire, UK) [39,40]. On day 105 of
gestation, ewes were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental groups: normoxia (N), chronic
hypoxia (H), chronic hypoxia with vitamin C treatment (HC), and normoxia with vitamin C
(NC); n = 18 for all groups.
Chronic hypoxia protocol
Ewes were housed in bespoke isobaric hypoxic chambers (Telstar Ace, Dewsbury, West York-
shire, UK) supplied with controlled volumes of nitrogen and air provided by nitrogen genera-
tors and air compressors, respectively, from a specially designed nitrogen generating system
(Domnick Hunter Gas Generation, Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, UK) [39,40]. Ambient PO2,
PCO2, humidity, and temperature within each chamber were monitored via sensors, displayed,
and values recorded continuously via the Trends Building Management System of the Univer-
sity of Cambridge through a secure Redcare intranet. In this way, the percentage of oxygen in
the isolators could be controlled with precision over long periods of time. For experimental pro-
cedures, each chamber had a double transfer port to internalize material and a manually oper-
ated sliding panel to bring the ewe into a position in which daily sampling of blood could be
achieved through glove compartments. Each chamber incorporated a drinking bowl on continu-
ous water supply and a rotating food compartment, which could be removed for determining
food intake. Therefore, all experimental and maintenance procedures could be carried out with-
out interruption of the hypoxic exposure. Pregnancies randomly assigned to the chronic hypoxia
group were placed inside the chambers at 103 dGA under normoxic conditions (11 L.sec−1 air,
equating to 39.6 m3.h−1). At 105 days, pregnancies were exposed to ca. 10% O2 by altering the
inspirate mixture to 5 L.sec−1 air: 6 L.sec−1 N2. The inspirate air mixture underwent a minimum
of 12 changes per hour in each chamber, and the incoming air mixture was passed via silencers
able to reduce noise levels within the hypoxic chamber laboratory (76 dB[A]) and inside each
chamber (63 dB[A]) to values lower than those necessary to abide by the Control of Noise at
Work Regulations. This not only complied with human health and safety and animal welfare
regulations but also provided a highly tranquil environment for the animal inside each chamber.
Maternal vitamin C treatment
Starting on day 105 of gestation, vitamin C (Ascorbate; A-5960; Sigma Chemicals, UK; 1.14
mmol/kg/day dissolved in 0.6 ml/kg saline and administered as a slow IV bolus injection) or

 saline vehicle (0.6 ml/kg slow IV bolus injection) were administered every day to the mothers
at approximately 09:00. The dose of vitamin C used in this study was derived from previous
studies in sheep pregnancy in our laboratory, which achieved elevations in circulating ascor-
bate concentrations within the required range for vitamin C to compete effectively in vivo
with NO in ovine pregnancy [33,34,37].
Blood sampling regimen and analysis
Samples of descending aortic maternal blood (0.3 ml) were taken daily for measurement of
maternal blood gases and pH and hemoglobin concentration, as previously described
[33,34,39,40]. Chamber oxygenation and maternal blood gases and pH were recorded at 104,
105, and 106 dGA then as summary averages of the preceding 5 days for 110, 115, 120, 125,
130, and 135 days. For all data, baseline for each animal was calculated as the average values of
104 and 105 days. On days 104, 105, 106, and 110 of gestation, and every 5 days after that, an
additional 9 ml of maternal blood was taken and divided into tubes containing the anticoagu-
lant EDTA or heparin. Samples were spun in a centrifuge for 5 minutes at 1000 x g and 4˚C,
after which the plasma was aliquoted into storage tubes and immediately frozen for subsequent
analysis.
Post mortem of ewes with fetuses
At 138 dGA, pregant ewes with male fetuses were transferred from the hypoxic chambers to
the post mortem laboratory wearing a respiratory hood providing the same hypoxic mixture.
Under hypoxic conditions, ewes and their fetuses were humanely killed by overdose of sodium
pentobarbitone (0.4 ml.kg−1 IV Pentoject; Animal Ltd, York, UK) and the fetus exteriorized by
Cesarean section. An 8-ml sample of fetal blood was taken from the umbilical artery using a
syringe with an attached needle, divided into tubes containing the anticoagulant EDTA or hep-
arin, then spun in a centrifuge for 5 minutes at 1000 x g and 4˚C. The plasma was aliquoted
into storage tubes and immediately frozen for subsequent analysis. Fetal crown rump length,
biparietal diameter, and hind limb lengths were then determined. The upper hind limb com-
prised the length of the femur, the middle hind limb ranged between the patella and tuber cal-
cis, and the lower hind limb ranged between the tuber calcis and the tips of the phalanges.
Remaining fetal organs were dissected, weighed, and immediately frozen for subsequent
analysis.
Maternal and fetal blood and plasma analysis
The maternal arterial blood P50, the PO2 at which 50% of the maternal hemoglobin is saturated
with oxygen, was calculated using the average of the maternal values for PO2 and Sat Hb from
day 115–135 of gestation, according to the Hill equation [87]. Maternal and fetal plasma con-
centrations of NOx species (NO2
− and NO3
−) were determined by a commercially available
assay kit (Caymen Chemical, USA, Cat No. 780001) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. A standard curve was plotted in Excel using a straight line fit, allowing NOx concentra-
tions to be calculated for each sample. The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were
3.4% and 2.7%, respectively, and the lower limit of detection of the assay was 2.5 μmol/L.
Maternal plasma concentrations of ascorbic acid were measured by a fluorimetric technique
using a centrifugal analyzer with a fluorescence attachment, according to the method of Vuil-
leumier and Keck [88], in collaboration with the Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory, Cam-
bridge, UK. The interassay coefficients of variation were 7.9% at 27.1 μmol/L and 5.0% at
89.7 μmol/L. The lower limit of detection of the assay was 10 μmol/L. Fetal plasma concentra-
tions of total L-homocysteine were measured using a commercially available enzyme

 immunoassay kit (Axis-Shield diagnostics Ltd., UK, Cat No. FHCY100), in collaboration with
the Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory, Cambridge, UK. The inter- and intra-assay coeffi-
cients of variation for a 6.1 μmol/L sample were 2% and 8%, respectively, and the lower limit
of detection of the assay was 1.0 μmol/L. Fetal plasma cortisol concentrations were measured
using a commercially available ELISA kit (IBL international, Germany, Cat No. RE52061),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The lower limit of detection of the assay was 2.46
ng/mL. The cross-reactivity of the antiserum with other cortisol-related compounds was 4.2%
cortisone, 1.4% corticosterone, 0.4% progesterone, and 7.0% deoxycortisol.
Fetal liver oxidative stress analysis
The expression of 3-NT and SOD and the activity of catalase in frozen, powdered, fetal right
liver lobe samples were determined by commercial assay kits (3-NT: ab116691, Abcam, Cam-
bridge, UK, AMS biotechnology, Abington, UK, SOD: Sigma-Aldrich, Catalase: 707002),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Placental analysis
Placentomes were classified into 4 categories by their gross morphological appearance, accord-
ing to Vatnick and colleagues [89]. Following classification, the individual types were counted
and weighed.
Postnatal care of offspring
At 138 dGA, pregnant ewes carrying female fetuses were transferred from the hypoxic cham-
bers to individual pens in a barn with a 12:12-hour light–dark cycle, where they were returned
to normoxic conditions. Ewes were allowed to deliver naturally and remained with their off-
spring until weaning. Newborn lambs were weighed within 12 hours of birth and then daily
for the first week of life. Thereafter, body weight was recorded at 2 weeks of age, 30 days of age,
and then at subsequent 30-day intervals until they were 9 months old.
Adult offspring surgery
At 265 ± 5 days (9 months) of age, when sheep are sexually mature and classified as young
adults, the female offspring were surgically instrumented under general anesthesia with vascu-
lar catheters and a femoral artery flow probe. In brief, food but not water was withdrawn 10–
15 hours before surgery in order to minimize the risk of bloat and regurgitation of the reti-
culo-rumen contents. On the day of surgery, anesthesia was induced by injection of Alfaxan
(1.5–2.5 ml/kg IV alfaxalone; Jurox Ltd., Worcestershire, UK) into the jugular vein and main-
tained by spontaneous inhalation of 1.5% isoflurane in 60:40 O2:N2O (2 L/min; IsoFlo; Abbott
laboratories Ltd., Berkshire, UK). Surgery was performed under aseptic conditions. An inci-
sion, approximately 3.5 cm long, was made in the medial surface of each of the hind limbs in
order to expose the femoral artery and vein, which were catheterized as before. On the contra-
lateral hind limb, a 4SB Transonic flow probe (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, New York,
USA) was placed around the main femoral artery for measurement of femoral blood flow.
Catheters and the flow probe lead were then tunneled subcutaneously on their respective sides
of the body and exteriorized via keyhole incisions made in the animal’s flanks. All skin inci-
sions were then sutured closed and plastic pouches were sewn onto each flank to house the
exteriorized catheters and flow probe. Following surgery, lambs were housed in individual
floor pens with a 12:12-hour light–dark cycle with free access to hay and water. Antibiotics (30
ml/kg IM procaine benzylpenicillin; Depocillin; Intervet UK Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK) were

 administered daily to the lamb for 5 days following surgery, and catheters were flushed daily
with heparinised saline (100 i.u/ml heparin, 0.9% NaCl). Following at least 5 days of postopera-
tive recovery, basal and stimulated cardiovascular function was assessed in vivo. Post mortem,
third-order femoral arteries (internal diameter < 300μm) were isolated and reactivity was
determined via in vitro wire myography.
Adult offspring basal and stimulated in vivo cardiovascular function
Experimental protocols were performed following at least 5 days of postoperative recovery. On
the morning of an experiment, ewe lambs were moved into a metabolic crate where their arte-
rial catheter was connected to a sterile pressure transducer (Argon Division, Maxxim Medical,
Athens, Texas, USA) and their flow probe to a Transonic flow meter (T206; Transonics Sys-
tems Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA). On each experimental day, lambs were allowed to acclimatize for
2–3 hours before commencing recordings. Basal cardiovascular variables were recorded con-
tinuously for 4–6 hours. A custom-built Data Acquisition System (Maastricht-Programmable
AcQuisition system, M-PAQ and IDEEQ software, Maastricht Instruments, the Netherlands;
1000-Hz sample rate) was used to record arterial blood pressure. Blood flow signals from the
Transonic flow meter were also directly recorded by the IDEEQ software, and heart rate was
calculated continuously online by the program using the femoral blood flow or systolic pulse
as a trigger.
On a separate day, stimulated cardiovascular function in the ewe lambs was determined by
measuring the change in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and femoral blood flow in response
to increasing bolus doses of the vasoconstrictors PE (0.25, 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 μg/kg IA,
diluted in 1 ml dH2O; L-phenylephrine; P-6126; Sigma Chemicals, UK); and Ang II (5, 10, 20,
40, 80, 160, and 320 ng/kg IA, diluted in 1ml dH2O; MP Biomedicals, California, USA) or in
response to increasing doses of the NO donor SNP (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μg/kg IA, diluted
in 1 ml dH2O; S-0501; Sigma Chemicals, UK). Suitable dose ranges were derived from pilot
experiments and previous studies in the literature [90,91]. All doses were administered in a
random order. On a separate day, the change in femoral vascular resistance was also deter-
mined after intravenous treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (100 mg/kg; Cay-
man Chemicals, Cambridge, UK).
Post mortem of adult offspring
At the end of all experimental procedures, ewe lambs underwent euthanasia with a lethal over-
dose of sodium pentobarbital administered to the indwelling venous catheter (200 ml/kg IV
Pentoject; Animalcare Ltd., York, UK). The brain, heart, and liver were dissected and weighed.
The brain was further dissected into the midbrain plus diencephalon, cerebellum, and right
and left hemispheres for compartmental weighing and storage of each section.
In vitro wire myography of adult offspring femoral arteries
Third-order femoral arteries (internal diameter < 300μm) were isolated and placed in physio-
logic buffer solution (PBS). A segment of approximately 2 mm in length was cut and threaded
with two 40-μm diameter stainless steel wires. The vessel segment was then mounted on a wire
myograph (Multi Wire Myograph System 610M; DMT, Denmark), while bathed in Krebs solu-
tion (mM: NaCl 118.5, KCl 4.75, MgSO4 7, H2O 1.2, KH2PO4 1.2, NaHCO3 25.0, CaCl2 2.5, and
glucose 5.5; Sigma) and constantly exposed to a gas mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% O2 at 37˚C in
the myograph chamber. Following a 30-minute equilibration period, the vessel was stretched in
a stepwise manner to a standardized tension equivalent to physiologic transmural pressure. Fol-
lowing a 20-minute equilibration period, all vessels were then precontracted with PE (10−5 M)

 before assessing endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to different concentrations of
methacholine (MetCh; 10−9 to 10−4 M; Sigma Aldrich). To determine the relative contribution
of endogenous NO, EDHF, and prostanoid to endothelium-dependent relaxation, concentra-
tion-response curves to MetCh were also generated following incubation for 10 minutes with
L-NAME (10−5 M; Sigma Aldrich) and L-NAME plus indomethacin (10−6 M; Sigma Aldrich),
as previously reported [92]. Vessels were washed repeatedly with Krebs solution and allowed to
equilibrate for at least 20 minutes between different concentration-response curves.
Data analysis and interpretation
For the in vivo cardiovascular experiments at adulthood, variables representing basal cardiovas-
cular function represent the average of the 4–6-hour recording period, which was always during
the same time of the day. Femoral vascular resistance (FVR) and femoral vascular conductance
(FVC) were calculated by applying Ohm’s Law to the circulation, using the following equations,
for which ABP is the arterial blood pressure and FBF is femoral blood flow: FVR = ABP/FBF
and FVC = FBF/ABP. An increase in vascular resistance signifies a reduction in blood flow
greater than can be accounted by a reduction in arterial blood pressure, therefore active vaso-
constriction. An increase in vascular conductance signifies an increase in blood flow greater
than can be accounted by an increase in arterial blood pressure, therefore active vasodilatation.
For the in vivo dose-response experiments at adulthood, maximal changes from baseline in
cardiovascular variables were recorded for each dose. The baseline was taken as the preceding
1–2 minutes of stable recording before each dose was given. After each dose, cardiovascular
variables were allowed to return to baseline and remain stable for at least 2 minutes before pre-
paring for the next dose.
For the in vitro wire myography experiments at adulthood, femoral arterial responses were
analysed using Prism (v.5.0, GraphPad software). Concentration-response curves were ana-
lysed using a sigmoidal fit curve. The maximal vessel relaxation (percent Rmax) was expressed
as percentage of the contraction induced by PE. The contribution of NO-dependent mecha-
nisms to the relaxation induced by MetCh was calculated by subtracting the area above the
curve (AAC) for MetCh–the AAC for MetCh + L-NAME. The contribution of NO-indepen-
dent mechanisms was the AAC for MetCh + L-NAME. The contribution of prostanoid to the
relaxation induced by MetCh was calculated as the AAC for MetCh + L-NAME–the AAC for
MetCh + L-NAME + indomethacin. The remaining AAC following MetCh + L-NAME + indo-
methacin was taken as EDHF [92].
For all in vivo and ex vivo experiments, data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. All variables
were assessed as appropriate either using two-way ANOVA comparing the interactions
between oxygenation and treatment or two-way ANOVA with repeated measures comparing
the effects of group and dose or time. Where a significant effect was indicated, Tukey’s posthoc
test was used to isolate the statistical differences (Sigma-Stat 3.5; Chicago, IL, USA and Graph-
Pad Prism 6). For all comparisons, statistical significance was accepted when P < 0.05.
