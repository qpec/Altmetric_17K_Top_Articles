The rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV), which causes microcephaly and Guillain-Barre
´
syndrome, signals an urgency to identify therapeutics. Recent efforts to rescreen dengue virus
human antibodies for ZIKV cross-neutralization activity showed antibody C10 as one of the
most potent. To investigate the ability of the antibody to block fusion, we determined the
cryoEM structures of the C10-ZIKV complex at pH levels mimicking the extracellular (pH8.0),
early (pH6.5) and late endosomal (pH5.0) environments. The 4.0 Å resolution pH8.0
complex structure shows that the antibody binds to E proteins residues at the intra-dimer
interface, and the virus quaternary structure-dependent inter-dimer and inter-raft interfaces.
At pH6.5, antibody C10 locks all virus surface E proteins, and at pH5.0, it locks the E protein
raft structure, suggesting that it prevents the structural rearrangement of the E proteins
during the fusion event—a vital step for infection. This suggests antibody C10 could be a good
therapeutic candidate.

 Z
ika virus1 (ZIKV) is a member of the flavivirus genus that
includes dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus
(WNV). ZIKV cryoEM structures2,3 show its surface
proteins
(envelope
(E)
and
membrane
(M)
proteins)
are
organized similar to DENV4 except with a tighter packing,
making the virus more thermally stable2.
The virus surface consists of 180 copies of E protein2 arranged
in icosahedral symmetry with 60 asymmetric units. In each
asymmetric unit, there are three individual E proteins – molecules
A, B and C. The E proteins exist as dimers; three dimers lie
parallel to each other forming a raft containing two asymmetric
units. There are in total 30 rafts arranged in a herringbone pattern
on the virus surface.
An E protein contains three domains—DI, DII and DIII5. It
is known for other flaviviruses that DIII contains the receptor-
binding site and plays an important role in fusion of the virus
with the endosomal membrane during cell entry6,7. The tip of DII
contains a fusion loop that interacts with the endosomal
membrane. DI is the central domain linking DII and DIII
together. The DI-DII hinge is highly flexible allowing DII to
expose its fusion loop during the fusion event. The DI-DIII hinge
was thought to be more rigid but it was observed to change in
conformation in the post-fusion E protein trimeric structure6,7.
The fusion event is hypothesized to occur in this sequence: (1)
virus E protein binds to cell receptors, (2) it is endocytosed, (3)
the low pH environment of the endosome causes the E proteins to
flip up exposing their fusion loops, allowing them to interact with
the endosomal membrane, (4) the E proteins rearrange to
trimeric structures, (5) the DIIIs of the E protein trimers change
in conformation twisting the trimers leading to the fusion of viral
membrane with the endosomal membrane, before the release of
the viral genome into cell cytosol.
The recent explosion of the number of ZIKV cases, together
with the association of ZIKV with the development of micro-
cephaly in fetuses8 and Guillian-Barre
´ syndrome in adults9, ignite
a pressing need for the development of therapeutics. Currently
there are no published human monoclonal antibodies (HMAb)
generated against ZIKV. To hasten the process of therapeutics
development, DENV HMAbs were rescreened10–12 for those that
cross-neutralize ZIKV. One group of antibodies has recently been
shown to be highly neutralizing to ZIKV—the envelope dimer
epitope binding antibodies10,11. Of these HMAbs, C10 is one
of
the
most
potent
plaque
reduction
neutralisation
test
(PRNT50 ¼ 0.024 mg ml � 1), as demonstrated recently in ZIKV
infected cell culture11,13 and mouse model13. In addition, it can
prevent antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV
infection in myeloid cells induced by dengue human sera10. In
this ADE model, the myeloid cells are mostly resistant to direct
ZIKV infection, suggesting that its specific receptor is lacking.
When sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human serum
was added to ZIKV, cell infection was enhanced. This is because
antibodies, which are attached to ZIKV, bind to the Fc receptor
on myeloid cells thus bypassing the need for ZIKV to directly
interact with its specific receptor. When HMAb C10 is added to
this mixture, it neutralizes the ADE effect. Since HMAb C10 is
also an antibody that would likely facilitate attachment to
Fc receptor on myeloid cells, it likely neutralizes the virus at a
post-attachment step of infection. We investigated the ability of
Fab C10 to prevent virus surface protein rearrangement during
fusion. We observed Fab C10 is able to lock the entire virus
surface at pH6.5, and at pH5.0, the E protein raft thereby
preventing structural rearrangement necessary for fusion.
Results
Effect of Fab C10 on ZIKV particles at different pHs. We
solved the cryoEM structures of Fab C10 complexed with ZIKV at
pH8.0, pH6.5 and pH5.0 mimicking the extracellular, early and
late endosomal conditions, respectively, and compared them
to the cryoEM maps of the uncomplexed ZIKV controls
at pH8.0 (ref. 2), pH6.5 (Supplementary Fig. 1b) and the two-
dimensional (2D)-class average of pH5.0 particles (Fig. 1).
Micrographs of the uncomplexed ZIKV control at pH8.0
sample show mostly smooth surfaced spherical particles (Fig. 1).
In the pH6.5 control sample (Fig. 1), some virus particles
aggregated, others become deformed, but there are also spherical
particles present. 2D class average of the pH6.5 spherical particles

 (Supplementary Fig. 1a and b), show the outer E protein layer
has moved to a slightly larger radius compared to the pH8.0
control virus. This suggests that the E protein layer has loosened.
Micrographs of the pH5.0 control sample (Fig. 1) show
aggregation of some particles, while others appear to be smaller
in diameter with hair-like densities protruding from the virus
surface. The 2D class average of these small particles (Fig. 1 inset)
showed the absence of the E protein compact layer, which was
present in the pH8.0 and pH6.5 control samples. This suggests
the E proteins are likely ‘flopping’ on the virus surface. The ZIKV
controls demonstrate some of the structural transformation stages
of the virus particles during fusion, from the compact structure at
pH8.0 to a slightly expanded structure at pH6.5 and finally to the
E proteins loosening and extending out from the virus lipid
membrane at pH5.0.
Micrographs of the ZIKV-C10 complexes at all pH conditions
show spiky looking particles, due to the Fab molecules bound to
virus surface (Fig. 1). The 2D class average of the pH6.5 complex
particles shows the E protein layer to remain at the same radius as
the pH8.0 control (Fig. 1 inset), unlike its pH6.5 ZIKV control.
The 2D class average of the pH5.0 complex particles in contrast
to its pH5.0 control shows the E protein layer is still present
(Fig. 1 inset).
CryoEM structures of ZIKV-C10 at different pHs. The cryoEM
structures of ZIKV-C10 complex at pH8.0, pH6.5 and pH5.0
are determined to 4.0, 4.4 and 12 Å resolution, respectively
(Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 2). In each of these structures, there
are 180 copies of Fab C10 bound to the virus surface. The pH8.0
and pH6.5 complex structures are very similar to each other
(Supplementary Fig. 3a) and their cryoEM maps correlate
to 4.5 Å resolution at FSC 0.143 cutoff (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
Therefore, only the higher resolution pH8.0 complex structure
will be described. A comparison of the E proteins of the pH8.0
complex structure with that of the previously solved uncom-
plexed
ZIKV2
shows
that
they
are
largely
the
same
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). Only molecule A of the E protein in
the asymmetric unit on the pH8.0 complex structure shows
clear densities for the ‘150 glycan loop’ (Supplementary
Fig. 4b). The glycan loop changed in conformation when
compared to the uncomplexed virus (Supplementary Fig. 4a,
inset), likely due to its interaction with the Fab molecule
(Supplementary Table 1). This glycan loop on ZIKV is five
residues longer than in DENV. The previously solved crystal
structure of DENV-C10 (ref. 14) did not show densities
corresponding to the glycan loop; therefore, it is not known if
this region interacts directly with the Fab. However, mutational
studies15 indicate that the residue 153 glycosylation site on
DENV is not important for HMAb C10 binding.
In the 4.0 Å resolution pH8.0 complex cryoEM map (Fig. 2a),
the
likely
interacting
residues
that
form
the
epitope
were identified, by using a cutoff of 5 Å distance16 (hydrogen
bonds/electrostatic
interaction:
4 Å
and
hydrophobic
interactions: 5 Å) between side chains of the Fab and E
proteins
(Fig.
3,
Supplementary
Fig.
5d,
Supplementary
Table 1). We also presented the epitope identified with a
cutoff of 8 Å distance17 between the Ca chains of the Fab and E
proteins (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Each end of the E protein
dimer has a Fab molecule attached (Fig. 3a). The Fabs bind
across the E proteins at the intra-dimer interface (Fig. 3a,
Supplementary Fig. 5b). The Fab bound near the five-fold
vertex end of the A-C0 dimer also likely interacts with residues
from the adjacent E protein at the inter-raft interface, whereas
the Fab molecule at the other end is also involved in inter-
dimer interactions within the raft (Fig. 3a, Supplementary
Fig. 5b). The epitopes recognized by the Fab molecules that
bind to B-B0 dimer also span across the inter-dimer E protein
interfaces. The ability of Fab C10 to bind E proteins at the
intra-dimer
interface
together
with
the
virus
quaternary
structure-dependent
sites—the
inter-dimer
and
inter-raft
interfaces, suggests that the entire E protein layer is locked.
This is consistent with the cryoEM structure (Supplementary
Fig. 3a) and the 2D class average (Fig. 1 inset) of the ZIKV-C10
complex at pH6.5 showing the E protein layer remains at a
similar radius as the uncomplexed ZIKV pH8.0 control, unlike
its pH6.5 control.

 Discussion
The ZIKV-C10 complex intra-dimer epitope is located on
the DII (at and around the fusion loop) on one E protein and
on DIII and DI of the other E protein in the dimer (Fig. 3b).
A plot of electrostatic charges of interacting residues on the
E protein intra-dimer epitope and the Fab paratope showed
complementary charges (Fig. 3c). A comparison with the
previously published crystal structure of DENV recombinant E
protein dimer complexed with Fab C10 (ref .14) (Supplementary
Fig. 6b) shows their epitopes largely overlap. The conserved
residues between ZIKV and DENV C10 intra-dimer epitope
mainly cluster on DII near the fusion loop (Supplementary
Fig. 6a and b). Although a comparison of the C10 intra-dimer
epitope to the crystal structures of other EDE antibodies, Fab C8
and A11 complexed with ZIKV recombinant E protein11
(Supplementary Fig. 6c and d) shows overlapping epitopes, the
C10 intra-dimer epitope spans a wider area covering larger parts
of DI and DIII. Furthermore, our cryoEM structure also shows
the interactions of Fab C10 with other virus quaternary
structure-dependent epitope at the inter-dimer or inter-raft
interfaces which are not observed in the crystal structures. These
interactions result in the E proteins on virus surface being
locked together and could be critical for its neutralization
mechanism.
A comparison of the cryoEM maps of pH5.0 complex to the
pH8.0 complex shows that the E protein layer has moved to a larger
radius (Fig. 4a), whereas the radii of the lipid bilayer membranes
are similar. The pH5.0 complex cryoEM map was interpreted by
fitting separately the Fab:A-C0 dimer and Fab:B-B0 dimer structures
from the pH8.0 complex structure into their respective densities

 (Fig. 2c, right). Comparison of the E proteins in an asymmetric unit
of the pH5.0 and pH8.0 complex by superimposing their molecules
A shows a slight shift (3.5Å) between the B0 molecule with respect
to the A-C0 dimer (Supplementary Fig. 7). This motion has only
slightly changed the distance of the interacting residues on the
Fab with that on the E proteins at the inter-dimer interface
(Supplementary Table 2) suggesting the Fab retains its binding
capability across this interface at pH5.0 and thus the E proteins
within the raft are locked by Fab C10.
Comparing the pH8.0 and the pH5.0 complex structures
(Fig. 4b) shows that the maximum radial movement of the E
protein outwards is at one end of the A-C0 dimer near the five-
fold vertex (B15 Å). This suggests the membrane associated stem
regions of the E protein need not be fully extended (up to B65 Å
in length) for this movement. In sharp contrast, a previous
study18 describing a very low resolution cryoEM map of a
DIII-binding Fab E16:WNV complex at pH6.0 showed the E
protein layer moved radially outwards by B60 Å, even though
the E protein density was not interpretable. Our pH5.0 complex
structure here shows a smaller radial expansion of the E protein
layer and therefore may be an even earlier event of fusion process
involving the dissociation of the E protein layer from the lipid
membrane. Another low resolution cryoEM structure of antibody
E104 complexed with DENV was shown to inhibit another stage
of the fusion process, possibly the ‘open trimeric E protein
conformation’19. This is likely a step prior to the formation of the
closed trimeric E protein structure6.
Although the E protein raft structure stays mostly intact in the
ZIKV-C10 pH5.0 complex structure, the inter-raft interactions
are disrupted (Fig. 4c), even though the Fab C10 in the pH8.0
complex structure forms inter-raft interactions at two sites
(Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 5c). A calculation of the E protein
electrostatic charges at pH8.0, 6.5 and 5.0 at the intra-dimer,
inter-dimer and inter-raft interfaces (Supplementary Fig. 8)
shows the residues becoming increasingly positively charged with
decreasing pH. This suggests that at pH5.0, the E proteins may
have the tendencies to repel each other, consistent with the 2D
class average of the uncomplexed ZIKV particles at pH5.0 (Fig. 1
insets), showing that the compact E protein layer is disrupted.
This raises a question of why the Fab inter-raft interaction in the
pH5.0 complex structure is disrupted, whereas the inter-dimer
interaction remains intact. We speculate that the two Fab
molecules at the inter-raft interface (Fig. 3a) identified in the
pH8.0 complex structure may not form strong enough contacts to
resist the large surface area of electrostatic repelling force at this
interface. On the other hand, at the inter-dimer interface, the two
Fabs in this region could still hold the dimers together, as the
surface area of repelling force is much smaller.
All antibodies can cause ADE at some concentrations. HMAb
C10, similar to other potent antibodies, causes ADE at a much
narrower range of concentrations compared to the other weakly
neutralizing antibodies10. To increase the safety of HMAb C10 as
a therapeutic antibody, its ability to cause ADE could be
eliminated,
by
mutating
its
Fc
region
(LALA
mutants)
abolishing its interaction with the myeloid cells Fc receptors.
Flavivirus such as DENV has been shown to be able to use
different receptors to gain entry into different cell types20,21.
ZIKV may also behave the same, as it has been shown to bind to
DC-SIGN and also TAM receptors22. Since different parts of the
E proteins interact with different receptors, it is unlikely that any
single type of antibody could inhibit virus attachment to all cell
types. In addition, ZIKV may also enter by ADE caused by
pre-existing DENV antibodies in individuals, thus completely
bypassing the need for virus to attach to a specific receptor for
infection. However, regardless of how the virus gets into the cell,
fusion is a vital step for productive infection. This emphasizes the
potential of HMAb C10 as a therapeutic agent, since it can
prevent structural rearrangements necessary for virus-endosomal
membrane fusion.
Methods

 then layered on BHK-21 cells in a 24-well plate and incubated at 37 �C for 1.5 h.
The infected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, overlaid with
carboxyl-methyl cellulose and incubated at 37 �C for 5 days. Cells were fixed and
stained, and the plaques were counted. Percentage neutralization was determined
from the comparison of the number of plaques in specific antibody dilutions to
the control (without antibody). PRNT50 is the concentration of the antibody that
causes 50% reduction in plaque numbers.
Virus sample preparation. Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells (ATCC) were grown
in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum at 29 �C. At
about 80% confluency, the cells were inoculated with ZIKV strain H/PF/2013
at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 and incubated at 29 �C for 4 days. The virus-
containing media was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000g for 1 h. Virus was
precipitated overnight from the supernatant using 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol
8000 in NTE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 120 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA) and
the suspension was centrifuged at 14,334g for 1 h. The resulting pellet containing
the virus was resuspended in NTE buffer and then purified through a 24% (w/v)
sucrose cushion followed by a linear 10-30% w/v potassium tartrate gradient. The
virus band, visualized by its light scattering ability, was extracted, buffer exchanged
into NTE buffer and concentrated using a concentrator with 100-kDa molecular
weight cut-off filter. All steps of the purification procedure were done at 4 �C.
The concentrations and purity of the E protein were estimated with Coomassie
blue-stained SDS-PAGE using different known concentrations of bovine serum
albumin solution as standards.
Monoclonal antibody C10 production. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) C10 was
synthesized in transfected human cells from cloned plasmids (Lake Pharma,
Belmont, CA, USA). Briefly, previously published heavy and light chain variable
region sequences14 were cloned into plasmids containing the human IgG1 heavy
and the human lambda 2 light chain constant regions. HEK293T cells (ATCC)
were transiently co-transfected with both the heavy chain and light chain plasmids,
and soluble antibody was collected and protein A purified. The antibody was
resuspended in a buffer containing 200 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM
NaOAc, pH7.0.
Preparation of the C10 Fab fragments. The Fab regions of C10 IgG were
produced by papain digestion. Briefly, the whole IgG (8 mg ml � 1) was incubated
overnight with immobilized papain (Thermo scientific) at 37 �C. After digestion,
the Fab fragment was purified with anion exchange chromatography (resource
Q, GE Healthcare) and gel filtration (Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL, GE
Healthcare) on an AKTA purifier system.
CryoEM sample preparation. The Fab C10 was mixed with ZIKV at a molar ratio
of 1.5 Fab to every E protein. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 �C
followed by B1 h on ice, and then applied to a cryoEM grid (pre-cooled to 4 �C)
for 10 s prior to adjusting the pH. The final pH of the virus was reached by addition
of a volume ratio of 1.5 ml of 50 mM MES buffer at respective pH (pH5.0 or pH6.5)
to every 1 ml of the virus-Fab mixture. The pH-adjusted samples were left on the
grid for another 15 s. The grid was then blotted with filter paper and flash frozen
in liquid ethane by using the Vitrobot Mark IV plunger (FEI, the Netherlands). The
corresponding controls (ZIKV without Fab) for each pH were prepared similarly.
Cryoelectron microscopy and image processing. The images of the frozen ZIKV
complexes were taken with the FEI Titan Krios electron microscope, equipped
with 300 kV field emission gun, at nominal magnification of 47,000 for pH5.0
Fab C10 ZIKV complex, and 59,000 for pH6.5 and pH8.0 complex samples.
A 4096 � 4096 FEI Falcon II direct electron detector was used to record the images.
Leginon23 was used to carry out the data collection. Images for pH8.0 and
pH6.5 complexes were collected in movie mode, with total exposure of 1.6 s
and total dose 38 e � Å � 2 for pH8.0, total exposure of 1.05 s and total dose of
43 e � Å � 2 for pH6.5 complex. The pH5.0 complex was collected at single
image mode, with the dose of 20 e � Å � 2. The frames from each ‘movie’ were
aligned using MotionCorr24 to produce full dose images used for particle selection
and orientation search, and images from the first several frames amounting to
the dose of about 18 e � Å � 2 to use in 3D reconstruction. The images were
taken at underfocus in 0.5B2.5 mm range. The astigmatic defocus parameters
were estimated with Gctf25 and accounted for in orientation search and 3D
reconstruction procedures in MPSA26 and Relion27. In total, 3,257, 2,540 and
2,865 micrographs were collected for Zika-C10 complex at pH8.0, pH6.5 and
pH5.0, respectively. The virus-Fab particles were picked with automatic selection
tool Gautomatch (from Dr K. Zhang, author of Gctf), run through 2D classification
in Relion27 to produce 2D class averages, broken and classes containing nonviral
particles and broken particles were removed, 49,100, 45,867 and 23,810 individual
particles in the Fab complex samples which were incubated at pH8.0, pH6.5 and
pH5.0, respectively, were selected for further processing. The 3D reconstruction of
the pH8.0 and pH6.5 complex structure was done with MPSA26, whereas Relion
was used for the pH5.0 complex structure. Uncomplexed ZIKV (EMDB ID EMD-
8139) was used as the starting model. The gold standard protocol27 for structure
refinement was used for all complexes. The 3D reconstruction procedure produced
the complex structures with resolutions of 4.0, 4.4 and 12 Å, for pH8.0, pH6.5
and pH5.0, respectively—using the Fourier shell correlation cutoff of 0.143 for the
pH8.0 and pH6.5 cryoEM maps and 0.5 for the pH5.0 cryoEM map (Extended
Data Fig. 2).
Protein structure building. The pH8.0 and pH6.5 ZIKV-C10 structures were
interpreted by fitting in the uncomplexed ZIKV (PDB ID 5IZ7) and Fab C10
(PDB ID 4UT9) first as rigid bodies in Chimera28 and then finer adjustment were
made by using the program Coot29. The 12 Å resolution cryoEM map of the ZIKV-
C10 complex at pH5.0 was interpreted by first fitting in the entire E-protein raft
complex with Fab molecules at pH8 structure by using the ‘fit-in-map’ function in
Chimera. The individual Fabs complexed with A-C0and also Fab complexed with
B-B0 dimers within a raft were kept as separate rigid bodies groups and their fit into
the density were independently optimized by using the ‘fit-in-map’ function in
Chimera.
Electrostatic potential calculations. Electrostatic potentials of protein surfaces
were calculated using Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver(APBS)30 and
PDB2PQR31 packages. The structures of uncomplexed ZIKV (PDB ID 5IZ7) and
the ZIKV complexed with Fab C10 were processed with the PDB2PQR web server
(nbcr-222.ucsd.edu/pdb2pqr_2.0.0/) to prepare the PDB files for APBS. A PARSE
force field was applied and PROPKA (v3.0) was used to assign pKa values. APBS
was then used to calculate the electrostatic properties of the protein surface.
Data availability. The cryoEM maps and the atomic models of the ZIKV-C10
complex at pH8.0, 6.5 and 5.0 have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy
Data Bank (EMD) and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the accession codes
EMD-9575, EMD-9573, EMD-9574 and 5H37, 5H30, 5H32, respectively. The data
that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors
