Abstract
Background: In the United States, doctor-diagnosed arthritis is a common and disabling chronic condition. Arthritis 
can lead to severe joint pain and poor physical function, and it can negatively affect quality of life.
Methods: CDC analyzed 2013–2015 data from the National Health Interview Survey, an annual, nationally representative, 
in-person interview survey of the health status and behaviors of the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. adult population, 
to update previous prevalence estimates of arthritis and arthritis-attributable activity limitations.
Results: On average, during 2013–2015, 54.4 million (22.7%) adults had doctor-diagnosed arthritis, and 23.7 million 
(43.5% of those with arthritis) had arthritis-attributable activity limitations (an age-adjusted increase of approximately 
20% in the proportion of adults with arthritis reporting activity limitations since 2002 [p-trend <0.001]). Among adults 
with heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, the prevalences of doctor-diagnosed arthritis were 49.3%, 47.1%, and 30.6%, 
respectively; the prevalences of arthritis-attributable activity limitations among adults with these conditions and arthritis 
were 54.5% (heart disease), 54.0% (diabetes), and 49.0% (obesity).
Conclusions and Comments: The prevalence of arthritis is high, particularly among adults with comorbid conditions, such as 
heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.  Furthermore, the prevalence of arthritis-attributable activity limitations is high and increasing 
over time. Approximately half of adults with arthritis and heart disease, arthritis and diabetes, or arthritis and obesity are limited 
by their arthritis. Greater use of evidence-based physical activity and self-management education interventions can reduce pain 
and improve function and quality of life for adults with arthritis and also for adults with other chronic conditions who might 
be limited by their arthritis.
Introduction
In the United States, doctor-diagnosed arthritis is a common 
and widespread chronic condition (1,2). Arthritis is a leading 
cause of disability (3) and is projected to affect 78.4 million 
adults by 2040 (4). The most common form of arthritis is 
osteoarthritis; other forms include, but are not limited to, rheu-
matoid arthritis, gout, lupus, and fibromyalgia. The annual 
direct medical costs attributable to arthritis are approximately 
$81 billion in the United States (5). About one million knee 
and hip joint replacements occur each year; 99% occur because 
of arthritis-related pain and functional limitations (6). Among 
adults with arthritis, 27% report severe joint pain (7); one 
third of adults aged ≥45 years report anxiety or depression (8); 
three in 10 find stooping, bending, or kneeling very difficult; 
approximately 20% cannot or find it very difficult to walk 
three blocks (approximately one quarter mile) or push/pull 
large objects (9). Adults with arthritis are more than twice as 
likely to report an injury related to a fall (10), and working-aged 
adults with arthritis have lower employment rates compared 
with adults without arthritis (5).
Arthritis is a common comorbid condition among adults 
with heart disease, diabetes, or obesity, and the combination 
of arthritis and one of these chronic conditions has been found 
to be associated with greater levels of physical inactivity (11). 
Moreover, arthritis may also hinder the ability of adults with 
prediabetes to engage in the physical activity recommended 
to prevent diabetes (12).
Many adults with arthritis are prescribed opioids (13), but 
safer options exist to help manage arthritis-associated pain. 
The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain 
states that insufficient evidence for and serious risks associated 
with long-term use of opioid therapy to treat chronic pain exist, 
and recommends use of exercise therapy, cognitive behavioral 
therapy, certain interventional procedures, acetaminophen, and 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of arthri-
tis (14). Although medications can help, nonpharmaceutical

measures help as well. For example, physical activity decreases 
pain and improves function, each by almost 40% (15), and self-
management education interventions produce improvements 
in a person’s confidence and skills to manage their condition 
and can reduce pain, fatigue, and depression by 10% to 20% 
(16). However, self-management education interventions are 
underused by adults with arthritis; only about 11% reported 
ever having taken a course (17). Furthermore, approximately 
one in three adults with arthritis report no leisure-time physi-
cal activity (18). A health care provider’s recommendation to 
patients with arthritis is important, because adults with arthri-
tis are significantly more likely to attend a self-management 
education program to learn to manage their condition when 
recommended by a provider than adults with arthritis who 
were not recommended (19,20). Physical activity programs 
can reduce yearly health care costs. For example, an analysis 
found that participation in EnhanceFitness,* an evidence-based 
physical activity intervention, reduced total health care costs by 
$945 per person (21), and produced substantial improvements 
(up to 18%) in function (e.g., muscle strength and balance) and 
self-reported health at follow-up at 8 months (22).
To update prevalence estimates of arthritis and arthritis-
attributable activity limitations, CDC analyzed 2013–2015 
data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
Methods
NHIS is an annual, nationally representative, in-person 
interview survey of the health status and behaviors of the 
noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. adult population. In each 
household identified, one adult is randomly selected in 
each family to complete the “sample adult” questionnaire.† 
Sampling weights were applied to account for household non-
response and oversampling of non-Hispanic blacks (blacks), 
Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Asians (Asians). Poststratification 
adjustments were applied by the National Center for Health 
Statistics using 2010 census estimates for the years 2013–2015. 
NHIS data from 2013 (N = 34,557), 2014 (36,697), and 
2015 (33,672) were combined and weighted. Annualized 
unadjusted and age-adjusted prevalence estimates (standard-
ized to the projected 2000 U.S. standard population) (23) 
were calculated overall and stratified by selected demographic 
(sex, age group, race/ethnicity, education level, and employ-
ment status) and health (body mass index category,§ physical 
activity level,¶ health status, doctor-diagnosed heart disease,** 
and doctor-diagnosed diabetes) characteristics. Absolute per-
cent differences for all comparisons to the referent subgroups 
within each characteristic were considered statistically sig-
nificant if the 95% confidence intervals of the differences of 
the age-adjusted estimates did not include zero. Orthogonal 
linear contrasts were performed to examine trends over time 
since 2002 in the age-adjusted prevalence of doctor-diagnosed

 § Body mass index = weight (kg)/(height [m])2; categorized as underweight/
normal weight (<25.0), overweight (25.0 to <30.0), or obese (≥30.0).
 ¶ Determined from responses to six questions regarding frequency and duration 
of participation in leisure-time activities of moderate or vigorous intensity 
and categorized according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Total minutes 
(moderate to vigorous) of physical activity per week were categorized as follows: 
meeting recommendations (≥150 min per week); insufficient activity 
(1–149 min); or inactive (0 min).
 
** Adults were considered to have doctor-diagnosed heart disease if they answered 
yes to any of the following four questions: “Have you ever been told by a doctor 
or other health professional that you had coronary heart disease? Angina, also 
called angina pectoris? A heart attack (also called myocardial infarction)? Any 
kind of heart condition or heart disease (other than the ones I just asked about)?”
Key Points
• Arthritis is common, expensive, and a leading cause of 
disability. An estimated 54.4 million adults (22.7%) 
had doctor-diagnosed arthritis. 
• Approximately 24 million adults with arthritis had 
activity limitations attributable to arthritis. Among 
adults with arthritis, the percentage limited by arthritis 
has increased by almost 20% over time.
• Approximately half of all adults with heart disease or 
diabetes had arthritis. Nearly one third of adults with 
obesity also had arthritis. Arthritis makes managing 
these conditions harder.
• Adults with arthritis are often prescribed opioids in the 
United States; however, better ways to help manage 
arthritis often exist. For example, physical activity can 
reduce pain and improve physical function by 
approximately 40%. However, one in three adults with 
arthritis report no leisure time physical activity.
• Using confidence and skills learned in self-management 
education workshops can help reduce pain, fatigue, and 
depression by 10% to 20%. However, only 11% had 
taken a self-management education workshop.
• Health care providers can play an important role in the 
management of arthritis. For example, adults with 
arthritis are more likely to attend a self-management 
education program when it is recommended by a health 
care provider.

arthritis and arthritis-attributable activity limitations among 
adults with arthritis. 
Having doctor-diagnosed arthritis was defined as answering 
“yes” to the question “Have you ever been told by a doctor or 
other health professional that you have some form of arthritis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia?” That stan-
dard question, in use since 2002, was designed to incorporate 
key elements of the 1994 public health definition of arthritis 
developed by the National Arthritis Data Workgroup, which 
sought to capture conditions treated by a rheumatologist or 
considered arthritis or a rheumatic condition by health care 
providers. Those who responded “yes” to arthritis also were 
asked “Are you now limited in any way in any of your usual 
activities because of arthritis or joint symptoms?” Persons 
responding “yes” to both questions were categorized as having 
arthritis-attributable activity limitations.
Results
During 2013–2015, an estimated 22.7% (54.4 million; 
age-adjusted prevalence = 21.0%) of all U.S. adults had doctor-
diagnosed arthritis. Almost half (49.6%, 22.2 million) of adults 
aged ≥65 years had arthritis; 7.1% (8.0 million) of young adults 
(aged 18–44 years) and 29.3% (24.2 million) of middle-aged 
adults (aged 45–64 years) had arthritis (Table 1). The majority of 
adults with arthritis (59.0%, 32.2 million) were aged <65 years. 
The age-adjusted prevalence of arthritis was significantly higher 
among women (23.5%) than men (18.1%), and was significantly 
lower among Hispanics (15.4%) and Asians (11.8%) than non-
Hispanic whites (whites) (22.6%), and among adults who com-
pleted college or higher (17.9%) than adults who had less than 
a high school education (21.2%). The age-adjusted prevalence 
of arthritis was highest among adults who were unable to work 
(43.9%) (Table 1). The age-adjusted prevalence of arthritis was 
lower among adults meeting physical activity recommendations 
(18.1%) than adults who reported insufficient activity (23.1%) 
or inactivity (23.6%), and higher among adults with fair/poor 
health (40.5%) than adults with very good/excellent health 
(15.4%) (Table 1).
The unadjusted prevalences of arthritis among adults with 
obesity, heart disease, or diabetes were 30.6%, 49.3%, and 
47.1%, respectively (Table 1) After adjustment for age, adults 
who had obesity compared with no obesity, had diabetes com-
pared with no diabetes, or had heart disease compared with no 
heart disease were approximately 1.5, 1.7, and 1.9 times more 
likely to have arthritis, respectively (Figure 1).
Among adults with arthritis, an estimated 43.5% 
(23.7 million; age-adjusted prevalence = 41.7%) had arthritis-
attributable activity limitations (Table 2). The age-adjusted 
prevalence of arthritis-attributable activity limitations was 
higher among women (43.8%) than men (38.5%); among 
blacks (48.6%), Hispanics (44.3%), and non-Hispanic mul-
tiracial adults (50.5%) than among whites (40.1%); among 
adults with less than a high school education (52.1%) than 
among adults with higher education (32.1%–43.6%); and 
among adults who were unable to work (80%) or unemployed 
(48.4%) than among adults who were employed (28.3%) 
(Table 2). The age-adjusted prevalence of arthritis-attributable 
activity limitations was higher among adults who were physi-
cally inactive (54.0%) than adults meeting recommendations 
(30.1%); among adults with fair/poor health (70.6%) than 
adults with very good/excellent health (23.2%); and among 
adults who had obesity (45.2%), heart disease (54.8%), and 
diabetes (52.5%) (Table 2).
The age-adjusted prevalence of arthritis-attributable activity 
limitations among adults with arthritis was significantly 
higher in 2015 (42.8%; 95% CI = 40.5–45.1) compared with 
2002 (35.9%; 95% CI = 34.1–37.6), an increase of 19.2% 
(p-trend <0.001) (Figure 2).  The age-adjusted prevalence of 
doctor-diagnosed arthritis did not change significantly over 
time (p-trend = 0.71).
Conclusions and Comments
During 2013–2015, an average of more than one in five 
(54.4 million) adults in the United States had doctor-diagnosed 
arthritis, with 43.5% (23.7 million) of adults with arthritis 
reporting arthritis-attributable activity limitations. The preva-
lence of  arthritis-attributable activity limitations among adults 
with arthritis increased by almost 20% over time (2002–2015) 
independent of the aging of the U.S. population, resulting 
in greater pain, disability, costs, and decreased quality of life.
As found in analyses of earlier NHIS surveys (1), women 
and adults who were unable to work, with fair/poor health, or 
with obesity, heart disease, or diabetes, not only had a higher 
prevalence of arthritis, but also had a higher prevalence of 
arthritis-attributable activity limitations. The prevalence of 
arthritis among adults who were unemployed was similar to 
the prevalence among employed adults, but unemployed adults 
had a much higher prevalence of arthritis-attributable activity 
limitations, suggesting that arthritis-attributable activity limi-
tations might play a role in their unemployment (5). Similar 
to past analyses, blacks and whites had a similar prevalence of 
arthritis, but the prevalence of arthritis-attributable activity 
limitations was higher among blacks. Hispanics had a much 
lower prevalence of arthritis, but a proportionately higher 
prevalence of arthritis-attributable activity limitations.
Our findings suggest that the burden of arthritis is increas-
ing and requires more widespread use of existing, underused 
evidence-based interventions. Physical activity is a proven 
strategy for managing arthritis, with known benefits for the 
management of many other chronic conditions (15). Arthritis

is common among adults with heart disease, diabetes, or obe-
sity, and the combination of arthritis and one of these chronic 
conditions has been associated with higher levels of physical 
inactivity (11), suggesting that arthritis-specific barriers to 
physical activity (concerns about worsening pain, damaging 
joints, and safely exercising) might be important concerns for 
adults with those conditions. Improving the health of adults 
with arthritis, including those with these combined chronic 
conditions, needs to include wider dissemination and imple-
mentation of evidence-based interventions. These interven-
tions meet the unique needs of adults with arthritis and have 
been found to reduce pain and improve function, mood, and 
confidence to manage health and quality of life (15,16).
A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initiative 
addresses the effects of multiple chronic conditions,†† which now 
affect one in four adults and are becoming increasingly common 
as the population ages. A previous study on multiple chronic 
conditions among adults aged ≥25 years found that arthritis 
is frequently present among the most common combinations 
of two and three conditions (24). CDC is promoting greater 
coordination among chronic disease programs within state health 
departments to address these chronic disease comorbidity con-
cerns.§§ Active promotion of evidence-based self-management 
education and physical activity interventions is appropriate for 
various chronic conditions. The self-management education¶¶

and physical activity interventions*** that CDC recommends 
for adults with arthritis are examples of proven, low-cost, com-
munity interventions that can benefit adults with arthritis, 
physical limitations, and other chronic conditions.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limita-
tions. First, doctor-diagnosed arthritis was self-reported and 
not confirmed by a health care professional; however, this case 
definition was validated for public health surveillance (25). 
Second, because NHIS is a cross-sectional survey, a causal 
relationship between risk factors (i.e., obesity or physical activ-
ity) and arthritis and arthritis-attributable activity limitations 
could not be established, although strong evidence exists that 
indicates obesity is associated with an increased risk for incident 
knee osteoarthritis (a common form of arthritis) (26). Third, 
social desirability bias might play a role in some self-reported 
characteristics, with underreporting of weight and overreport-
ing of height and leisure-time physical activity. Fourth, from 
2013 to 2015, the NHIS response rates were 61.2%, 58.9%, 
55.2%, respectively, indicating potential nonresponse bias, 
although survey weights were applied to address this bias and 
improve external validity (27). Fifth, if multivariate analyses 
were to be performed, certain observed group differences, such 
as those related to race/ethnicity and arthritis-attributable 
activity limitations, might have been explained by differences 
in prevalence of comorbid conditions or other factors (e.g., 
health care access). Finally, NHIS does not survey persons 
in long-term care institutions (e.g., nursing homes for the 
elderly and hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or 
intellectually disabled); therefore, this analysis likely under-
estimates the prevalence of arthritis and arthritis-attributable 
activity limitations.
Arthritis is a large and growing clinical and public health 
problem. In 2017, CDC is funding arthritis programs in 12 
states to disseminate arthritis-appropriate evidence-based 
physical activity and self-management education interventions 
in their communities.††† Given the high prevalence of arthritis 
and the increase in arthritis-attributable activity limitations 
in the United States, health care providers and public health 
practitioners can address arthritis and other chronic conditions 
by prioritizing proven, nonpharmaceutical interventions, such 
as self-management education and appropriate physical activ-
ity, as effective ways to improve health outcomes, especially for 
groups with the highest prevalence of arthritis and arthritis-
attributable activity limitations.

 * Age adjusted to the 2000 U.S. projected adult population, using three age groups: 18–44, 45–64, and ≥65 years.
 † Doctor-diagnosed arthritis was defined as an affirmative response to the question “Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you have 
some form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia? Those who answered “yes” were asked “Are you now limited in any way in any of your usual 
activities because of arthritis or joint symptoms?” Persons responding “yes” to both questions were defined as having arthritis-attributable activity limitations.
 § Some categories might not sum to overall because of missing information on some characteristics.
