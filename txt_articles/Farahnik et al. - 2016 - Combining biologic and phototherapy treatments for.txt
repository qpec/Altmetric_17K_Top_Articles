Background: The efficacy and safety of biologic and phototherapy in treating moderate-to-
severe psoriasis is well known. However, some patients may not respond well to biologic agents or 
phototherapy on their own and may require combination therapy. Skillfully combining a biologic 
agent and phototherapy may provide an additive improvement without much increase in risks.
Objective: To summarize the current state of evidence for the efficacy and safety of combining 
biologics with phototherapy in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
Methods: We conducted an extensive search on Pubmed database for English language lit-
erature that evaluated the use of a combination of biologic and phototherapy for the treatment 
of moderate-to-severe psoriasis through January 2016. The search included the following key-
words: psoriasis, etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, biologics, phototherapy, 
and combination therapy.
Results: The primary literature included randomized controlled trials, a head-to-head study, 
open-label controlled and uncontrolled trials, case series, and case reports. Etanercept was 
used in over half of the reported cases, but other biologic agents used included ustekinumab, 
adalimumab, and infliximab. The vast majority of phototherapy was narrowband ultraviolet B 
(NBUVB) radiation. Most cases reported enhanced improvement with combination therapy. 
Serious adverse events throughout the study duration were reported in <3% of the patients. 
Long-term adverse events cannot be excluded.
Conclusion: Combination of biologic and phototherapy appears to be a viable clinical strategy in 
the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis not responsive to monotherapy, despite limitations 
in the data available. NBUVB in combination with biologics appears to be especially effective. 
However, the long-term impact of these combinations is yet to be determined.
Keywords: psoriasis, biologics, phototherapy, UVB, UVA, combination therapy
Introduction
Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition with a worldwide preva-
lence of 0.5% (Asia) to 8.5% (Norway).1,2 Symptoms of psoriasis – which include red-
ness, scaling, flaking, pruritus, skin tightness, pain, and bleeding – have a significantly 
negative impact on patients’ physical and mental functioning.3 Psoriasis also leads to 
impairment in the quality of life, psychological well-being, and work productivity.3,4 
Despite the rapid development of novel treatment modalities over the past two decades, 
surveys conducted by the National Psoriasis Foundation reveal that a significant por-
tion of patients with psoriasis remains undertreated relative to the severity of their 
disease.3,5 This is especially true for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, 
who account for 20%–30% of the total psoriasis population.2,4

US Food and Drug Administration-approved biologic 
agents for the treatment of psoriasis include the antitumor 
necrosis factor agents (etanercept, adalimumab, and inflix-
imab), the anti-interleukin-12/23 antibody (ustekinumab), 
and most recently, the anti-interleukin-17 antibodies 
(secukinumab and ixekizumab). Biologics have significantly 
advanced the treatment of psoriasis, although some may 
experience an inadequate response6 and others may experi-
ence loss of efficacy (ie, “biologic fatigue”) with long-term 
use.7 The combination of agents may act synergistically and 
is often more effective than a single agent alone. Combi-
nation therapy is a concept that uses two different agents, 
sometimes with reduced doses, which target specific steps 
in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and have distinct risk pro-
files.8 This may enhance efficacy and allow drug sparing, 
decreasing the risk of long-term cumulative toxicity from a 
single agent at higher doses. There is an increasing number 
of publications demonstrating the efficacy of combination 
therapy with biologic agents in moderate-to-severe psoria-
sis. We reviewed the safety, efficacy, and patient accept-
ability of combination therapy involving biologic agents 
and phototherapy.
Methods
We searched the PubMed database up to January 1, 2016, 
using the following keywords: “psoriasis” or “psoriatic 
arthritis” and with “biologic”, “etanercept”, “adalimumab”, 
“ustekinumab”, “infliximab”, “combination therapy”, 
“phototherapy”, “UV phototherapy”, “corticosteroids”, and 
“topical treatment”. Only English-language publications 
involving adult humans with moderate-to-severe psoriasis 
were included. Publications included were randomized 
controlled trials, open-label controlled and uncontrolled 
prospective studies, retrospective studies, case series, and 
case reports. The references of identified publications were 
also investigated for additional publications of interest. 
Publications on the effect on psoriatic arthritis as a primary 
endpoint were included if information about the effect on 
psoriasis were included. The authors defined combination 
therapy as “two therapies used concomitantly for at least 4 
weeks or at least one dose of an additional systemic agent at 
some point during treatment.” We included studies that had 
clinical intent to transition to another medication for safety 
reasons. Alefacept was not included in this review as Astellas 
Pharma U.S. Inc. (Northbrook, IL, USA) ceased manufactur-
ing the drug in 2011. Efalizumab was withdrawn from the 
market in 2009 and thus not included. At the time of writing 
this manuscript, there were no combination studies  
involving 
the biologics golimumab, certolizumab, secukinumab, or 
ixekizumab.
Results
We found a total of ten publications assessing combination 
therapy involving biologics and phototherapy, with all pho-
totherapy used being narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB). A 
total of 268 patients had been placed on combination therapy 
among all the trials, with an average age of 43 years (Table 1). 
The cohorts studied were largely similar; in general, there 
was evidence of benefit for the use of combination therapy 
in psoriasis, with eight trials (six controlled and two uncon-
trolled) showing enhanced clinical benefit, one controlled 
trial showing enhanced benefit only in those patients with 
high adherence to NBUVB treatment regimen, and one head-
to-head trial showing no benefit. Combination of NBUVB 
and etanercept was studied in 234 patients (Table 1). In order 
of frequency of study use, this was followed by adalimumab 
(24) and ustekinumab (ten).
Many studies demonstrated the efficacy of combination 
of etanercept with NBUVB with improvements in Pso-
riasis Area Severity Index (PASI) in previously untreated 
patients,9,10 and in patients who experienced an inadequate 
response11,12 with etanercept alone at 50 mg once9,13 or 
twice weekly (Table 1).10–12,14 Moreover, NBUVB reduced 
time to clearance with etanercept 50 mg once weekly9,13 
and etanercept 50 mg twice weekly.14 Calzavara-Pinton et 
al, in a randomized controlled intraindividual comparison 
study demonstrated that all eight patients in the study who 
did not achieve an adequate response with either etanercept 
or NBUVB monotherapy ultimately achieved PASI-75 with 
combination treatment (Table 1).14 This study validated that 
NBUVB or etanercept alone was not responsible for the 
therapeutic results.
Additionally, Lynde et al demonstrated the importance of 
high adherence to the NBUVB regimen for achieving signifi-
cant improvement in clinical response to etanercept.12 High 
adherence to the NBUVB regimen was defined as missing 
only two or less treatments in any 4-week period. Patients 
missing more than two treatments in a 4-week period were 
considered nonadherent, and did not achieve clinically signifi-
cant improvement. At 16 weeks, the proportion of patients in 
the high adherence group achieving PASI-90 was 42.9% for 
etanercept with NBUVB, compared with 3.4% for etanercept 
monotherapy (P=0.018).
Adalimumab in combination with NBUVB therapy15,16 
and ustekinumab in combination with NBUVB therapy17 
were also investigated. Two studies were conducted with

a combination of adalimumab with NBUVB. Both  
studies 
demonstrated that NBUVB significantly accelerated the 
response to and improved the clearance of psoriatic lesions 
in adalimumab-treated patients. The sole study examining 
ustekinumab combined with NBUVB was an intraindividual 
half-body comparison study conducted by Wolf et al.17 They 
found that PASI-75 was achieved  
significantly more often on 
the UV-irradiated body halves than the nonirradiated body 
halves at week 6 of the patients taking ustekinumab at a dose 
of 45 or 90 mg (depending on body weight). Both combina-
tions showed enhanced clinical improvement compared to 
biologic monotherapy (Table 1).
Only one study failed to establish the efficacy of com-
bination therapy. The head-to-head pilot study by Park et 
al, which examined the combination treatment of NBUVB 
and etanercept 50 mg twice weekly, and compared it with 
etanercept monotherapy, failed to demonstrate significantly 
enhanced improvement with combination therapy. Patients in 
the etanercept monotherapy, and combination of etanercept 
and NBUVB therapy arms had similar rates of achieving 
PASI-75 (46.7% and 53.3%, respectively); however, the 
small sample size limited the ability to achieve significance 
(Table 1).18 In addition, it is important to note that this 
head-to-head comparison study used psoriasis patients with 
a body mass index >30. Studies have reported a suboptimal 
response to etanercept in psoriasis patients with a body mass 
index >30.19,20
Numerous studies have reported patient dissatisfaction as 
a significant barrier to optimal psoriasis treatment.4 Treatment 
satisfaction has been shown to predict adherence, which may 
affect treatment effectiveness in real-world clinical prac-
tice.21,22 Patients receiving combination treatment that was 
more effective in clearing psoriasis were significantly more 
satisfied than patients treated with monotherapy.21 In a study 
by Duffin et al, it was observed that patients receiving adalim-
umab, etanercept, ustekinumab, or NBUVB had significantly 
higher effectiveness scores and rates of overall satisfaction 
than methotrexate monotherapy or topical steroids alone.21 
Interestingly enough, inconvenience has been shown to be a 
main factor in discontinuation of NBUVB phototherapy.23 This 
suggests that patient satisfaction with a treatment’s effective-
ness and side-effect profile may compensate for its inconve-
nience among patients who continue on therapy. Although 
no studies have directly examined patient adherence to and 
satisfaction of biologics in combination with phototherapy, the 
increased efficacy of this combination hints at the possibility 
of increased patient satisfaction and adherence.
In general, combination therapy involving biologics and 
NBUVB phototherapy was very well tolerated. The most

common side effect noted among the studies was erythema. 
Nine out of the ten studies reported no serious adverse 
events for the combination therapy. In the study examining 
ustekinumab combined with NBUVB by Wolf et al,17 the 
serious adverse event of a herpetic eruption on the thigh, 
which led to treatment discontinuation, was observed. No 
skin cancers were reported throughout the duration of any 
trials. Long-term data on the development of skin cancer or 
other adverse events from the use of such a treatment com-
bination has not yet been provided.
Discussion
The use of combination therapy involving a biologic agent 
and another form of therapy to target moderate-to-severe 
psoriasis is becoming more common with increased literature 
being released on the topic. We specifically looked at cur-
rent literature that consisted of ten publications that studied 
combination biologic therapy with phototherapy, specifically 
NBUVB. The majority of publications were open-label pro-
spective studies. In total, combination therapy was reported 
in 618 cases of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The average 
age of these patients was 42 years, and nearly all patients 
had failed at least one prior systemic treatment. A serious 
adverse event was noted in only one patient. In general, most 
prospective studies used PASI-75 at week 12 or week 24 as 
the primary endpoint (Table 1).
The majority of available data reviewed showed that 
the combination of biologics with phototherapy agents had 
a superior efficacy compared to monotherapy in patients 
with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Treatment benefit with 
combination therapy was demonstrated across various study 
designs, demonstrating that combining a biologic with 
phototherapy is reasonable when efficacy of monotherapy 
is insufficient. The largest body of evidence assessed the 
combination of NBUVB and etanercept. According to the 
nine evaluated studies, there is a reasonable evidence for 
the use of combination therapy with NBUVB for moderate-
to-severe psoriasis. Etanercept 50 mg both once and twice 
weekly showed benefits, without added adverse effects.
In general, the combination of biologics with NBUVB 
showed good tolerability and few concerns relating to safety 
throughout the duration of the studies. Laboratory values 
and rate of adverse events for the biologics combined with 
phototherapy did not appear to be different from using either 
therapy alone. However, a potential increase in skin cancers 
is an important concern with the use of this combination. 
The immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporine, for instance, 
 
combined with phototherapy has been documented to 
increase the risk of skin cancer.24 Although current biologic 
agents are thought to be less globally immunosuppressive 
than cyclosporine, biologic monotherapy has been associated 
with a possible slightly increased risk of nonmelanoma skin 
cancer (NMSC) in some studies.25,26 With this in mind, the 
combination should be applied with caution. If possible, the 
combination should be limited to short durations of time for 
induction in difficult-to-treat cases, especially if the patient is 
a fair-skinned Caucasian individual. Long-term observations 
with NBUVB phototherapy alone have not yet demonstrated 
evidence of increased risk of NMSC.27–29 However, no con-
clusive statements can yet be made on the long-term risk of 
NMSC with combination treatment. Further investigation 
assessing long-term skin cancer risk and other adverse events 
in large controlled trials would be of interest.
There are some major limitations to the conclusions that 
can be drawn from this review. Interpreting the results is 
complicated by the heterogeneous study populations, small 
number of study subjects, and varying definitions of thera-
peutic success or relapse in some of the included studies 
investigating the efficacy and safety of combination therapy 
with NBUVB.
In total, 9 out of 10 studies demonstrated favorable 
efficacy and safety of combination therapy involving bio-
logic and phototherapy, although the degrees of therapeutic 
enhancement varied. This review is significant because 
the subsets of patients who do not respond adequately to 
nonbiologic therapy are commonly encountered. Combin-
ing biologic agents with nonbiologic treatments, such as 
NBUVB phototherapy, broadens the armamentarium for the 
long-term control of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Although 
no regimen involving the combination of a biologic agent 
and phototherapy has been approved for the management of 
moderate-to-severe psoriasis, the results of several relevant 
studies demonstrate the usefulness of such a treatment com-
bination. Nevertheless, further studies are required to assess 
the long-term safety and efficacy of such combinations.
