ABSTRACT
High-dose melphalan (HDM) followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-
HCT) remains the standard-of-care therapy for multiple myeloma (MM) even with the availability
of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs. Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity is the main
cause of morbidity after HDM. Amifostine, a cytoprotective agent, may reduce HDM-associated
GI toxicity. We conducted a case control study comparing HDMþ auto-HCT with or without ami-
fostine for MM patients. One hundred and seven patients treated at University Hospitals
Cleveland Medical Center who received pre-transplant amifostine were compared to 114 patients
treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center without use of this agent. Amifostine 740mg/m2 was
administered as a bolus infusion at 24 h and 15 min before HDM. Patients’ characteristics were
similar in both the groups. Amifostine therapy was well tolerated without any significant adverse
effects. Grade II or greater oral mucositis (27.1% vs 47.4%; p ¼ .002), nausea (31.8% vs. 86.0%;
p ¼ .0001), vomiting (18.7% vs. 52.6%; p ¼ .0001) and diarrhea (56.1% vs. 72.7%; p ¼ .006)
occurred less frequently in the amifostine-treated group. There was no discernable effect of ami-
fostine on engraftment, progression-free or overall survival. Our results indicate that amifostine
decreases GI toxicity while preserving anti-myeloma efficacy of HDM and auto-HCT.

Introduction
Although over the past decade there has been signifi-
cant improvement in the outcome of multiple mye-
loma (MM) patients, this disorder remains incurable
despite the availability of proteasome inhibitors (PI),
immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) and monoclonal anti-
bodies [1,2]. Epidemiology data predict that compared
to 2010, there will be a 57% increase in the number of
MM patients by 2030 as a result of population aging
and longer survival [3]. Although more than three dec-
ades since Lazarus et al. [4,5] described use of high-
dose melphalan (HDM) followed by autologous hem-
atopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT), this thera-
peutic modality remains one of the most effective
treatment modalities to delay disease relapse. MM
constitutes the most common indication for auto-HCT
[6].
Several
randomized,
prospective
trials
have
showed a higher response rate, longer progression-
free survival (PFS) and, in some studies, longer overall
survival (OS) with auto-HCT [7]. Non-hematological tox-
icities, especially to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that
include oral mucositis (OM), anorexia, nausea, vomit-
ing, and diarrhea, are the main dose-limiting toxicities
with the use of HDM and auto-HCT [4,8]. Alopecia is
another common toxicity with HDM seen in >95%
patients [7]. Other less common side effects are transa-
minitis, pneumonitis, and cardiac arrhythmias [9]. GI
toxicities are a major limitation to the use of auto-HCT
especially in the elderly population which constitute a
significant proportion of MM patients, where the
median age at diagnosis is 68 years [4]. Preventing GI
toxicities without compromising melphalan anti-mye-
loma efficacy is an important goal that could lead to
expansion of transplant eligibility to older patients
[10]. Also, minimizing treatment-related morbidity may
allow dose-escalation or the addition of novel anti-

 myeloma agents to HDM; such may improve the depth
of response and remission duration after ASCT [11–13].
Amifostine, originally known as WR-2721 (Walter-
Reed), is an organic thiophosphate that exists as a
phosphorylated prodrug [14], which is dephosphory-
lated by alkaline phosphatase on plasma membrane
into the active form, W-1061 [14]. The cytoprotective
effect of amifostine is mediated by donating hydrogen
ions for DNA repair and by scavenging intracellular
free
radicals
leading
to
amelioration
of
cytotoxic
effects of radiation and alkylating agents [15]. This pro-
tective effect is mainly restricted to nonmalignant cells
[16] due to a more than 200-fold higher concentration
of alkaline phosphatase in normal cell membranes. In
addition, drug is absorbed by active transport into nor-
mal tissues while only passive diffusion into tumor
cells [14,17,18]. Amifostine is FDA-approved for pre-
venting nephrotoxicity and xerostomia associated with
platinum-based therapy and head and neck irradiation
[19,20]. Several small trials have shown a reduction in
melphalan-induced
GI
toxicity
when
amifostine
is
given before auto-HCT [21,22]. Furthermore, in a phase
1 dose-escalation trial, amifostine was shown to pro-
tect patients from GI toxicities of melphalan which
facilitated melphalan dose-escalation to doses as high
as 280 mg/m2 [23].
We conducted a retrospective, matched-pair study
comparing HDM þ auto-HCT with or without amifos-
tine in MM patients. We hypothesized that amifostine
therapy will reduce GI toxicity associated with auto-
HCT without compromising its anti-myeloma effect.
Methods
Patient population
We studied MM patients who underwent auto-HCT as
the planned consolidation strategy after induction
therapy. University Hospitals (UH) Seidman Cancer
Center, Cleveland, OH routinely uses amifostine for all
MM patient who undergo auto-HCT. Matched controls
were MM patients treated using auto-HCT at the MD
Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Houston, TX with-
out use of amifostine. Controls were matched by age
and year of transplant. One hundred and thirteen
patients
were
transplanted
using
amifostine
from
January 2007 to July 2014. One patient did not receive
amifostine and was excluded from analysis, while five
patients had a second autologous transplant after dis-
ease relapse and were excluded from the survival ana-
lysis. The cohort included transplants performed after
2007 due to practicality of data collection through
electronic medical record.
Amifostine preparation, administration, and
dosage
The institutional review boards at both institutions
approved the study. All doses were calculated based
on
corrected
ideal body
weight. Except
for four
patients who received 140 mg/m2 due to impaired
renal function (UH cohort), melphalan 200 mg/m2 was
administered as intravenous (IV) bolus on day1 using a
central venous catheter. The drug was given within
15 min of reconstitution with buffer solution contain
60% propylene glycol with sodium citrate and ethanol.
The UH patients received two doses of amifostine
given as 740 mg/m2 IV bolus at 24 hours and again at
15 minutes before melphalan therapy, e.g. infusion on
day-1 and -2. Patients were kept in supine position
during the administration of amifostine. Blood pres-
sure was monitored before and immediately after the
infusion, and thereafter as previously described [24,25].
All patients received ice chips peri-melphalan infusion
(15 min prior to, during and 15 min post-melphalan).
All patients received thawed, cryopreserved autolo-
gous hematopoietic cell infusion on day zero. Adverse
reactions were assessed using Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4. Filgrastim was
administered daily to all the patients from the day of
transplantation until neutrophil recovery >500/mcL.
Response criteria and toxicity assessment
Disease
was
graded
using
International
Myeloma
Working Group response criteria as complete response
(CR), very good partial response, partial response (PR),
stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) [26]. GI
toxicity including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and OM
was assessed using CTCAE criteria. Grading system for
studied toxicities remained nearly the same with negli-
gible differences across v.3 (published August 2006)
and v.4 version of CTCAE (published May 2009). The
grading was assessed retrospectively when there was
no charted grading in patient’s EMR at the time of tox-
icity occurrence.
Statistical analysis
PFS was measured from the date of auto-HCT to the
date of disease relapse or progression, with censoring
for those in remission at the date of a second planned
transplant. OS was measured from the date of auto-
HCT to the date of death. Survival distribution was
estimated using Kaplan–Meier methods [27] and differ-
ences of OS, PFS between groups was examined by
Wilcoxon test [28]. The effect of treatment on OS and
PFS was estimated using a Cox model [29] after

ance status and number of infused CD34þ cells.
Continuous variables were examined by T-test or
Wilcoxon Rank Sum test after checking normality, and
the association between two categorical variables was
examined using chi-square test. All tests are two-sided
and p values � .05 were considered significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
One hundred and seven MM patients constituted the
amifostine group while 114 patients from MDACC
were used as controls. Median follow-up of surviving
patients was 35 (range 2–100) months in both cohorts.
Patient and disease characteristics are listed in Table 1.
Patients from MDACC had better pre-transplant per-
formance status, received shorter duration of pre-HCT
anti-myeloma therapy and had fewer patients who
achieved at least a PR prior to auto-HCT (74% vs. 80%
for PR or better response, p ¼ .002). Also, patients in
the MDACC cohort received a slightly lower CD34þ
cell dose (Table 1).
Toxicity profile and engraftment after auto-HCT
There was no significant difference between all-grade
OM, nausea or vomiting between the two cohorts.

nausea: 31.8% vs. 86.0% (p ¼ .0001), and vomiting:

additional score of ECOG [NOT a clear phrase; revise],
the risk of having grade � II OM increased 1.89 fold
(p ¼ .015). Subgroup analysis of grade II and higher

There were no treatment-related deaths in either
cohort. At a median follow-up of 35 months, PFS was

 related adverse effects with two scheduled doses of
740 mg/m2.
Neutrophil engraftment time was shorter in the ami-
fostine-treated cohort. Previous studies suggested a
protective effect of amifostine on normal hematopoi-
esis against radiation and chemotherapy agents [30,31].
However, the amifostine cohort received a higher CD34
cell
dose,
which
confounds
the
interpretation
of
engraftment
data.
Interestingly,
Shpall
et
al.
[32]
showed ex vivo treatment of autografts with amifostine
lead to shorter engraftment time. We were unable to
show an advantage in terms of hospital duration of
stay for the study group. Others, however, have sug-
gested that amifostine use is associated with shorter
hospitalizations in the non-transplant setting [33].
In regards to amifostine dose, one study showed
that 300 mg/m2 did not prevent mucositis in the auto-
HCT setting [34]. Doses of 740 mg/m2 or 910 mg/m2
have been successfully used outside the transplant
scenario, which is in line with our findings [33,35].
There was no evidence for either an immediate or
delayed adverse impact of amifostine on PFS or OS.
The longer PFS observed in the amifostine cohort is
likely explained by a deeper pre-HCT MM response.
Our results suggest a selective protective effect of this
agent on normal but not tumor cells against the cyto-
toxic effects of melphalan, as previously reported
[15,16].
Prevention of OM with cryotherapy was used in
both cohorts [36]. Other measures to prevent OM

 have been investigated in patients undergoing high-
dose
chemotherapy
and
hematopoietic
cell trans-
plant. Palifermin, a recombinant human keratinocyte
growth factor, is a truncated version of endogenous
keratinocyte growth factor that was shown to be
effective in reducing the incidence and duration of
severe OM in patients undergoing high-dose chemo-
therapy
and
hematopoietic
cell
transplant
[37].
Limitations to its widespread use include cost and
perceived low efficacy in reducing diarrhea [37–39].
Low-level helium-argon laser therapy can reduce OM
after
hematopoietic
cell
transplant.
This
approach
exerts an analgesic effect and may promote wound
healing; however, its exact biologic action on oral
mucosa is not clear and does not include the rest of
the GI tract [40].
Gender was a significant predictor of OM in our
study. Several other studies highlight the role of
female gender as a predictor of GI toxicity. Vokurka
et al. [41] randomized 132 patients to normal saline or
povidone-idone mouse wash among patients who
underwent
autologous
stem
cell
transplant.
OM
occurred more commonly among females compared
to males (86% vs. 60%, p ¼ .0016) and was worse and
last longer. The female gender was confirmed as an
independent risk factor for OM in separate multivariate

 analysis [42]. Also, females are more likely than males
to experience oral mucositis in patients receiving other
type of cytotoxic chemotherapy [43,44]. Some reports
emphasize on lower melphalan clearance in female as
the rational; Mougenot et al. [45] showed that melpha-
lan clearance was higher in male patients (14.3 ± 4.5 l/h
per m2) than in female patients (12.3 ± 4.5 l/h per m2).
Our study has the usual limitations of a retrospect-
ive chart review analysis that was performed at two
separate academic centers. Although we have tried to
match the patient characteristics, there may be inher-
ent differences in practices at the two institutions that
may have affected the incidence of GI toxicity in add-
ition to the use of amifostine. The basic GI protective
regimens, as noted below, are quite similar at both
centers. Both centers use cryotherapy prior to and dur-
ing HDM administration. Both institutes use a combin-
ation of ondansetron plus dexamethasone as standard
anti-emetic prophylaxis with as needed dose of ondan-
setron, prochlorperazine, and promethazine to control
breakthrough nausea and vomiting. Both centers use
loperamide and diphenoxylate as needed for antidiar-
rhea effects.
Our analysis indicates that the use of two amifos-
tine doses of 740 mg/m2 before auto-HCT is safe and
associated with significant reduction in grade II and
higher GI toxicities without any deleterious effect on
engraftment or anti-myeloma efficacy. Amifostine use
could
conceivably
allow
further
melphalan
dose-
intensification for patients with resistant or high-risk
disease. The feasibility of this approach has been
shown before [46]. Also, pretreatment with amifostine
potentially could expand the utilization of auto-HCT
for modestly frail MM patients that might not be con-
sidered eligible for this treatment modality. The con-
firmation
of
protective
effect
of
amifostine
in
prospective randomized trials along with a detailed
cost analysis may lead to change in practice.
