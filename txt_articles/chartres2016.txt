Association of Industry Sponsorship With Outcomes
of Nutrition Studies
A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Nicholas Chartres, MHumNutr; Alice Fabbri, MD; Lisa A. Bero, PhD
IMPORTANCE Food industry sponsorship of nutrition research may bias research reports,
systematic reviews, and dietary guidelines.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether food industry sponsorship is associated with effect sizes,
statistical significance of results, and conclusions of nutrition studies with findings that are
favorable to the sponsor and, secondarily, to determine whether nutrition studies differ in
their methodological quality depending on whether they are industry sponsored.
DATA SOURCES OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception until
October 2015; the reference lists of included reports.
STUDY SELECTION Reports that evaluated primary research studies or reviews and that
quantitatively compared food industry–sponsored studies with those that had no or other
sources of sponsorship.
DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently extracted data from each report and rated
its quality using the ratings of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, ranging from a
highest quality rating of 1 to a lowest of 5.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Results (statistical significance and effect size) favorable to
the sponsor and conclusions favorable to the sponsor. If data were appropriate for
meta-analysis, we used an inverse variance DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model.
RESULTS Of 775 reports reviewed, 12, with quality ratings ranging from 1 to 4, met the
inclusion criteria. Two reports, with data that could not be combined, assessed the
association of food industry sponsorship and the statistical significance of research results;
neither found an association. One report examined effect sizes and found that studies
sponsored by the food industry reported significantly smaller harmful effects for the
association of soft drink consumption with energy intake and body weight than those not
sponsored by the food industry. Eight reports, including 340 studies, assessed the
association of industry sponsorship with authors’conclusions. Although industry-sponsored
studies were more likely to have favorable conclusions than non–industry-sponsored studies,
the difference was not significant (risk ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 0.99-1.72]). Five reports assessed
methodological quality; none found an association with industry sponsorship.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although industry-sponsored studies were more likely to
have conclusions favorable to industry than non–industry-sponsored studies, the difference
was not significant. There was also insufficient evidence to assess the quantitative effect of
industry sponsorship on the results and quality of nutrition research. These findings suggest
but do not establish that industry sponsorship of nutrition studies is associated with
conclusions that favor the sponsors, and further investigation of differences in study results
and quality is needed.

ietary guidelines provide recommendations to
reduce the risk of conditions such as obesity, diabe-
tes, and cardiovascular disease. Even when dietary
guidelines have been based on systematic reviews,1 the evi-
dence has been criticized for being biased2 and guidelines
contain conflicting recommendations.3,4 Recent scrutiny of
the funding practices of transnational food companies5 has
heightened concerns about the credibility of nutrition
research and how sponsorship affects the findings.6-9 It is
important to know whether funding source influences the
statistical significance of the results or the effect sizes of
nutrition studies and should, therefore, be considered when
biases in these studies are assessed.10
Considerable evidence suggests that industry sponsor-
ship of research is associated with outcomes that favor the
sponsor.11-14 Examinations of pharmaceutical and tobacco
industry–sponsored research show that, even when control-
ling for methodological biases, industry-sponsored studies
are more likely to have results that favor the sponsor’
s prod-
uct than studies with other sources of sponsorship.11,15,16
Industry sponsors can influence the outcomes of a study in
many ways, including the framing of the research ques-
tions, the design and conduct of the study, selective report-
ing of results, and “spin” on conclusions.17-19 Food compa-
nies appear to use tactics similar to those of the tobacco
industry to influence research.13,20,21
Prior assessments of the influence of industry sponsor-
shipandconflictsofinterestinnutritionresearchhavehadcon-
flicting results.22,23 It is unclear whether studies of sponsor-
ship bias in nutrition research have controlled for other
potentialbiases,suchasmethodologicalquality,thatcouldalso
influence research outcomes. We conducted a systematic re-
view of studies examining the association of industry spon-
sorship with the statistical significance of results, effect sizes,
and conclusions of nutrition research.
Our objectives were to determine whether (1) published
nutrition studies with food industry sponsors are more likely
to have results and/or conclusions that are favorable to the in-
dustry and (2) published nutrition studies sponsored by in-
dustry differ in their methodological quality compared with
studies with other or no sponsors.
Methods
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
This review includes published reports that were designed to
quantitativelycomparefoodindustry–andnon–foodindustry–
sponsored samples of primary nutrition research studies (such
as cohort studies) or reviews. We excluded conference pre-
sentations, opinion pieces, and letters to the editor. We had
no language restrictions.
Primary Outcomes
We hypothesized that studies with food industry sponsor-
ship would be more likely to have favorable results and con-
clusions than those without industry sponsorship. We
assessed 2 primary outcomes:
Results (Statistical Significance and Effect Size)
Favorable to the Sponsor
For studies of health benefits, favorable results were defined
as those that were statistically significant (eg, P < .05 or 95%
confidence interval excluding the possibility of no differ-
ence) in favor of the sponsor’
s product(s) or diet. For studies
of harms, favorable results were defined as those in which
harms were not statistically significant (eg, P > .05 or 95% con-
fidence interval including the possibility of no difference) or
results had a statistically significant measure of harm in the
comparator group.
Wealsodeterminedwhethereachreportassessedthemag-
nitude of effect size estimates as an outcome. The effect size
measures the standardized mean difference between groups;
an effect size of 0 means that there is no difference. Because
the effect size is a measure of the magnitude of an effect, it can
be compared across different outcome measures.
Conclusions Favorable to the Sponsor
Conclusions that suggested that the nutrition intervention or
exposure being studied was beneficial to health and/or safe
wereconsideredfavorabletothestudysponsor.Otherwise,the
conclusions were considered unfavorable.
Secondary Outcome
Wedeterminedwhethereachreportcomparedthemethodologi-
cal quality of industry- vs non–industry-sponsored studies.
Search Strategy
We searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, and
Scopus (inception to October 2015) (eMethods in the Supple-
ment). We hand-searched the reference lists of all included re-
ports to identify any additional relevant reports that the elec-
tronic searches missed.
Selection of Studies
Two investigators (N.C. and L.A.B.) independently screened
the titles and abstracts of all retrieved records for obvious ex-
clusions and then applied our inclusion criteria to the full text
of the remaining reports. Any discrepancies were resolved by
Key Points
Question Is food industry sponsorship of nutrition studies
associated with outcomes that favor the sponsor?
Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis examined 12
reports and found that 8, which included 340 studies, could be
combined in a meta-analysis. Although industry-sponsored studies
were more likely to have conclusions favorable to industry than
non–industry-sponsored studies, the difference was not
significant. There was also insufficient evidence to assess the
quantitative effect of industry sponsorship on the results and
quality of nutrition research.
Meaning These findings suggest but do not establish that
industry sponsorship of nutrition studies is associated with
conclusions that favor the sponsors, and further investigation of
differences in study results and quality is needed.

the Supplement.
Data Extraction
Two assessors (N.C. and A.F.) independently extracted data
from each included report; a third assessor (L.A.B.) adjudi-
cated any disagreements. We contacted the authors of
2 reports to acquire missing data.
Rating System to Evaluate the Quality of Evidence
Two investigators (N.C. and L.A.B.) independently rated the
quality of the included reports using the Oxford Centre for
Evidence-based Medicine ratings, with a highest rating of 1
to a lowest of 5. The quality ratings are as follows: 1, properly
powered and conducted randomized clinical trial; system-
atic review with meta-analysis; 1a, systematic review with-
out meta-analysis; 2, well-designed controlled trial without
randomization; prospective comparative cohort trial;
3, case-control studies; retrospective cohort study; 4, case
series with or without intervention; cross-sectional study;
5, opinion of respected authorities; case reports.24
Statistical Analysis
To test our hypothesis that studies with food industry sponsor-
ship would be more likely to have favorable conclusions than
those without industry sponsorship, we conducted a meta-
analysisusingReviewManager5.3software(CochraneCollabo-
ration).WeassessedstatisticalheterogeneityusingtheI2statis-

Results
Search Results and Characteristics of Included Reports
As shown in Figure 1, 775 references were identified and 12
reports met the inclusion criteria.
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the included re-
ports. The quality of the reports ranged from 1 to 4. The 12 re-
ports were published between 2003 and 2014. The median
number of included studies was 68.5 (range, 17-2539). Four re-
ports included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only, 2 in-
cluded reviews only, and 6 included a mix of study designs.
Four reports focused on the effects of sugar-sweetened bev-
erage consumption, and 4 focused on a broad range of inter-
ventions to reduce obesity.

(Table1).Ninereportsexaminedassociationsofindustryspon-
sorship and reported outcomes. Three reports examined both
industry sponsorship and author conflicts of interest to-
gether, while 1 of these examined industry sponsorship and
author conflicts of interest separately.
The most commonly studied outcome was the associa-
tion of industry sponsorship with conclusions (8 reports); 5 re-
ports assessed only conclusions. eTable 2 in the Supplement
showshowconclusionsthatwerefavorabletothesponsorwere
defined and measured in the reports. Only 1 report assessed
the association of industry sponsorship with effect size esti-
mates, and 2 measured the association with statistical signifi-
cance of the results.
Of the 12 reports, 1 was industry funded and 8 were not; 1
report had no external funding, and for 2 reports funding was
not disclosed (Table 2). Authors of 3 reports had financial ties
to the food industry; for 6 reports, the authors stated that they
had no conflicts of interest and for 3 reports author conflicts
of interest were not disclosed.
Methodological quality was assessed in 5 reports using a
variety of definitions and tools (Table 3).
Summary of Findings
Statistical Significance: Industry-Sponsored
vs Non–Industry-Sponsored Studies
Neither of the 2 reports that examined the association be-
tween industry sponsorship and the statistical significance of
results found an association. Both of these reports were sys-
tematic reviews (quality rating 1a). The results of the reports
could not be combined because they measured statistical sig-
nificance in different ways (per study vs all individual out-
comes). One report containing 70 RCTs measuring the effi-
cacy and harm of synbiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics (foods
or supplements that aim to stimulate the growth of beneficial
gut bacteria) found no significant association between fund-
ingsourceandstatisticallysignificantresultsfor7ofthe8clini-
cal outcomes examined. Overall, industry-sponsored studies
reported 20.6% (73 of 354) of all clinical outcomes as favor-
able compared with non–industry-sponsored studies, which
reported 16.7% (9 of 54) as favorable.29 The second report, ex-

children, found that there was insufficient variability in the
study results to measure any association between study spon-
sorship and results; almost all study results found a statisti-
cally significant improvement in bone health outcomes.31
Effect Size: Industry-Sponsored vs Non–Industry-Sponsored Studies
Only 1 report including 88 observational studies and RCTs ex-
amining sugar-sweetened beverages and various health out-
comes assessed the relationship between industry sponsor-
ship and effect size.33 The report was a systematic review that
analyzed RCTs and observational studies in separate meta-
analyses (quality rating 1). For the harmful outcome of
energy intake, overall effect size was smaller in industry-
sponsored (r = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.04-0.07) compared with non–
industry-sponsored (r = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.22-0.24; P < .006)
studies, and for the outcome of body weight, effect size was
also smaller in industry-sponsored (r = 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01-
0.04) vs non–industry-sponsored (r = 0.10; 95% CI, 0.09-
0.11; P < .006) studies. However, no significant difference in
effect size was observed among RCTs.
Conclusions: Industry-Sponsored
vs Non–Industry-Sponsored Studies
Eight reports, including 340 studies, examined the association
of sponsorship and conclusions, and all could be combined in
a meta-analysis (Figure 2). Although industry-sponsored stud-
ies were more likely to have favorable conclusions than non–
industry-sponsored studies, the difference was not significant
(risk ratio [RR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.99-1.72).
We conducted 2 additional analyses to explore heteroge-
neity. Two of the 8 reports defined industry sponsorship as a
combination of study sponsorship and author conflicts of in-
terest, and these could not be separated for analysis.22,27 We
conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding these 2 reports and
found similar results (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.93-1.54; I2 = 42%).
In addition, 2 reports included only reviews and not primary
research studies.22,28 Exclusion of these from the analysis pro-
duced similar results (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.92-1.34; I2 = 5%).
One report, with quality rating 1a, examined the associa-
tion of author conflicts of interest and conclusions.23 This re-
port examined the health risks and nutritional value of geneti-
callymodifiedfoodsandfoundasignificantassociationbetween
author conflicts of interest and favorable study conclusions;
100% (41 of 41) of studies with author conflicts of interest
reached favorable conclusions, compared with 76% (39 of 51)
without author conflicts of interest (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.52).
Methodological Quality: Industry-Sponsored
vs Non–Industry-Sponsored Studies
Five reports compared the methodological quality of industry-
sponsored with non–industry-sponsored studies (Table 3). No
reports examined the association of authors’conflicts of

a Chalmers Method: produces a weighted score for RCT quality that assesses
the study protocol (with randomization and blinding weighted most heavily),
statistical analysis, and presentation of results. Points are awarded for the
quality of reporting of trial information, not the quality of the study design
itself.35
bAssessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR): calculates a quality
score for reviews based on review design, research strategy, selection of
articles, data abstraction process, assessment of the scientific quality of the
studies included in the review, evaluation of publication bias, or mention of
possible conflicts of interest. The maximum score is 9 for a qualitative
systematic review and 11 for a meta-analysis.36
c Quality Checklist Criteria for primary research and for reviews: These tools
were developed by the American Dietetic Association for assessing nutrition
studies. Both tools include a mix of questions about reporting (eg, were
statistical tests adequately described?) and how a study was conducted (eg,
were statistical tests appropriate?). The QCC for primary research calculates a
score based on questions related to 10 domains (eg, subject selection,
blinding, outcomes, analysis) and the QCC for reviews calculates a score based
on questions related to 10 domains (eg, search strategy, study selection,
analysis).37
dThe Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs rates each of the following
domains—sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of
participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete
outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and “
other issues”—as being at a
high risk of bias, low risk of bias, or unclear risk of bias. An overall score is not
calculated.38
e Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT): This 25-item checklist
describes what should be reported in an RCT in the following sections:

est and the outcomes of nutrition research. The majority of the
reports examined only the effects of sponsorship on conclu-
sions. Influence on conclusions is important to study be-
cause the relationship between industry sponsorship and con-
clusions favorable to the study sponsor has been previously
demonstrated in tobacco,13 pharmaceutical,11 and environ-
mental toxin research.41 Spin on conclusions, which has been
identified as a tactic used in other industries,16,42 can influ-
ence how research is interpreted19,42 and can undermine the
credibility of research reports. From the standpoints of devel-
oping systematic reviews, dietary guidelines, and other evi-
dence-basedadvice,theresultsaremorerelevantthanthecon-
clusions; for example, only the results are included in
systematic reviews.
Our findings suggest that there is insufficient evidence to
assess the quantitative effect of industry sponsorship on the
results of nutrition research and, thus, account for this bias in
systematic reviews. The 2 reports that assessed the associa-
tion of sponsorship and the statistical significance of re-
search results found no association.29,31 This may be because
there was insufficient power to compare industry- and non–
industry-sponsored studies, as most of the studies were in-
dustry sponsored. In addition, funding sources of nutrition
studies are often not disclosed.5 Improved disclosure of fund-
ing sources and larger samples for analysis should make it pos-
sible to assess the association of funding source with statisti-
cal significance of study results, as well as effect sizes. It is
important to determine whether industry sponsorship af-
fects the results of nutrition research, as has been shown for
pharmaceutical industry funding of drug research.11
Food Industry Sponsorship and Methodological Quality
Our review found that industry-sponsored studies were of
equal or better quality than those with other funding sources.
However, methodological quality was usually measured using
tools that derived quality scores. The use of quality scores can
be problematic because the choice of scale can influence the
results of meta-analyses. Individual study domains should be
assessed instead.43 These findings are consistent with previ-
ous examinations of pharmaceutical and tobacco research
showing that industry-sponsored studies are of equal or
better quality than non–industry-funded studies.11,15,44
Industry sponsorship can influence research results in a
variety of ways. Methodological quality is only one character-
istic that can influence study outcomes. Sponsors can also
frame research questions to produce a desirable outcome or
to generate research that diverts attention from certain ques-
tions. For example, the tobacco industry funded research on
the adverse health effects of indoor air components other than
tobacco smoke to distract from the evidence on harms asso-
ciated with environmental tobacco smoke exposure.15 Spon-
sors can influence how the study is actually conducted and
whether the results of the study are published in full or not.45
Although industry sponsorship has been associated with se-
lectivereportingofresearchoutcomesthatfavorthesponsor,46
this practice was not assessed in any of the reports that we re-
viewed. The association of research sponsorship with the de-
sign and reporting of nutrition research should be examined.
Strengths and Limitations of the Review
We conducted a comprehensive search and followed explicit
and well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for the re-
ports. Authors of reports were also contacted for additional
data. We reported on all outcomes and rated the quality of all
the reports that we included.
The limited number of studies that met our inclusion cri-
teria prevented the conduct of statistical analyses of the rela-
tionship between industry sponsorship and study results. We
could not quantitatively synthesize data for all outcomes be-
cause the reports were heterogeneous. They included differ-
ent topics and designs of studies and classified industry spon-
sorship in different ways. In addition, we only included data
on sponsorship that was disclosed, and did not seek to iden-
tify industry funding or other associations that were not
disclosed in the publications.
Implications
Thescrutinyofthefundingpracticesoflargetransnationalfood
companies6,7 has threatened the credibility of nutrition re-
search and researchers.5 However, without empirical work ex-
amining the association of industry sponsorship with the re-
sults of nutrition research, researchers, policy makers, and the
public have no way of quantifying and understanding the ex-
tent of industry influence on the data. It is challenging to rig-
orously assess the association of industry sponsorship with re-
search outcomes. The quality of the reports that we examined
varied. Research to quantify the influence of industry spon-
sorship on effect estimates can be improved by obtaining com-
plete and accurate data on sponsors of research and conflicts
of interest of sponsors and authors, and focusing on specific
researchquestionsandstudydesigns.Thus,biasinstudymeth-
ods, as well as bias related to sponsorship, can be measured.
Mostofthestudiesincludedinourreviewfocusedonspon-
sorship by large transnational food companies. However, con-
flicts of interest in nutrition research are complex because they
encompass more than financial relationships with the manu-
facturers of the food products being tested.47 For example,
there is a conflict of interest if an investigator receives royal-
tiesfromsellinghisorherowndietaryadvice.Inaddition,trade
organizations representing different food groups also spon-
sor nutrition research.48,49 Therefore, it is important to know
whether the extent and mechanisms of bias are similar across
different types of sponsors.
Previous research documenting the influence of industry
sponsorship on research in other health-related fields has led
to international reforms to make data more accessible, con-
flicts of interest and funding more transparent, and to calls for
stricter standards and policies for managing conflicts of inter-
est, critiquing and reporting evidence, and conducting sys-
tematic reviews.10,50,51 Similar research is needed to help re-
fine methods for evaluating studies used in systematic reviews
that form the basis of dietary guidelines. Such research should
alsodeterminewhether(1)biasesassociatedwithindustrycon-
flicts of interest necessitate policies for disclosure and man-
agement similar to those now widely accepted in clinical re-
search; (2) mechanisms to reduce publication bias, such as
study registries or open access data, should be considered for

nutrition studies; and (3) research agendas should be revised
to produce studies that are relevant to population health.
Conclusions
Although industry-sponsored studies were more likely to
have conclusions favorable to industry than non–industry-
sponsored studies, the difference was not significant. There
was also insufficient evidence to assess the quantitative
effect of industry sponsorship on the results and quality of
nutrition research. These findings suggest but do not estab-
lish that industry sponsorship of nutrition studies is associ-
ated with conclusions that favor the sponsors, and further
investigation of differences in study results and quality is
needed.
