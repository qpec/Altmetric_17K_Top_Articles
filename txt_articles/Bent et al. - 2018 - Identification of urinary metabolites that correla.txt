Abstract
Background: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have urinary metabolites suggesting impairments in
several pathways, including oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and gut microbiome
alterations. Sulforaphane, a supplement with indirect antioxidant effects that are derived from broccoli sprouts and
seeds, was recently shown to lead to improvements in behavior and social responsiveness in children with ASD. We
conducted the current open-label study to determine if we could identify changes in urinary metabolites that were
associated with clinical improvements with the goal of identifying a potential mechanism of action.
Methods: Children and young adults enrolled in a school for children with ASD and related neurodevelopmental
disorders were recruited to participate in a 12-week, open-label study of sulforaphane. Fasting urinary metabolites and
measures of behavior (Aberrant Behavior Checklist—ABC) and social responsiveness (Social Responsiveness Scale—SRS)
were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for the pre- to
post-intervention change in each of the two clinical scales (ABS and SRS) versus the change in each metabolite.
Results: Fifteen children completed the 12-week study. Mean scores on both symptom measures showed improvements
(decreases) over the study period, but only the change in the SRS was significant. The ABC improved − 7.1
points (95% CI − 17.4 to 3.2), and the SRS improved − 9.7 points (95% CI − 18.7 to − 0.8). We identified 77
urinary metabolites that were correlated with changes in symptoms, and they clustered into pathways of
oxidative stress, amino acid/gut microbiome, neurotransmitters, hormones, and sphingomyelin metabolism.
Conclusions: Urinary metabolomics analysis is a useful tool to identify pathways that may be involved in the
mechanism of action of treatments targeting abnormal physiology in ASD.
Trial registration: This study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02654743) on January 11, 2016.

 Background
Persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have
many physiological abnormalities compared to typically
developing children. These abnormalities cluster into
four
areas:
oxidative
stress,
inflammation/immune
dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and environ-
mental toxicant exposure [1]. Prior studies examining
physiological abnormalities have examined biomarkers
for one particular metabolic pathway (such as cytokines
[2], oxidative stress [3], or mitochondrial dysfunction
[4]), and a variety of others has been proposed [5]. How-
ever, recent studies have used metabolomics—the study
of all metabolites present in a cell, organism, tissue, or
sample (e.g., blood, urine, saliva, feces)—to more broadly
examine differences in multiple, concurrent physio-
logical mechanisms in children with ASD. These meta-
bolomics studies comparing children with ASD to
typical controls have identified many physiological ab-
normalities that also cluster into similar categories of
dysfunctional redox status, inflammatory status, and
mitochondrial function as well as metabolomic signals
that suggest abnormalities in the gut microbiome (the
microbial population of an individual’s gastrointestinal
tract, which is increasingly recognized as an important
contributor to health and disease) [6–16]. Together, all
of these studies strongly suggest that persons with aut-
ism have abnormal physiology that may be intermittent
or continuous.
An exciting therapeutic potential in ASD involves the
treatment of these identified physiological abnormalities
when they are active. Correction of these abnormalities
may improve behavior, symptoms, and quality of life in
ASD. Preliminary evidence from intervention trials sup-
ports this possibility. For instance, children with autism
who were treated with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) for 12 weeks had significant improvements in ir-
ritability compared to children treated with placebo [17].
In a recent randomized controlled trial of methylcobala-
min (methyl B12), children with ASD who were treated
with this methyl donor had significant improvements in
the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) compared to
those treated with placebo, and improvements were
correlated with physiological measures that indicated
improved antioxidant status [18].
A previous, small, randomized controlled trial exam-
ined the efficacy of sulforaphane for the treatment of
children with ASD [19]. Sulforaphane is an indirect anti-
oxidant from broccoli sprout and seed extracts [20].
Sulforaphane has many physiological effects, including
upregulation of cytoprotective enzymes and increases in
detoxification and excretion of highly reactive and po-
tentially damaging toxicants and free radicals. During
the 18-week trial, children receiving oral sulforaphane
demonstrated marked improvements in both the ABC
and the SRS [19]. Further, the observed benefits disap-
peared and returned to baseline when the treatment was
stopped. However, the above study did not examine the
physiological changes in children with ASD undergoing
treatment.
We therefore sought to examine changes in physio-
logical markers that may underlie beneficial treatment
effects from sulforaphane by analyzing changes in urin-
ary metabolites. In an open-label clinical trial of 15
school-age children with ASD, we performed metabolo-
mics analyses of urine before and after treatment to
determine if there are changes in the low molecular
weight products of metabolism associated with treat-
ment response, which might explain the mechanism of
action of this phytochemical.
Methods
Participants
The study was approved by the Committee on Human
Research at the University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF) on November 5, 2015, and the trial was regis-
tered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02654743) on January 11,
2016, prior to performing any study activities. Partici-
pants completed the study on May 9, 2016, and metabo-
lomics analyses were completed in September 2016.
Prior to initiating the study, the UCSF investigators
developed a relationship with a local, non-public school
(Oak Hill School, San Anselmo, CA) that specializes in
the education of children and young adults with autism
and related neurodevelopmental disorders (ages 5–22,
grades K-12). This unique academic-school-parent part-
nership was created with the goal of improving overall
care and communication between caregivers, clinical
providers, and teachers. All children/families attending
the school (n = 35 at study initiation) were invited to
participate in the study through e-mail, informational
flyers, and an evening informational session.
Children and young adults were eligible to partici-
pate if they were enrolled in the school, had a formal
diagnosis
of
autism,
reported
no
prior
use
of
sulforaphane-containing supplements, were willing to
hold other treatments constant for the 12-week study
period, had no major medical problems other than
ASD, were willing to provide urine samples, and par-
ents were willing to complete online surveys at speci-
fied intervals. ASD was defined as being present if
the child had a diagnosis from a medical professional
trained to diagnose autism or if the student was de-
termined by school staff and the study psychiatrist to
meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM–IV) criteria for ASD.
Informed consent was obtained from the parent/care-
giver of all study participants.

 Intervention
The study was open-label, and all clinicians, parents, and
teachers were aware of the treatment initiation and dur-
ation of 12 weeks. All enrolled children were provided
weight-based dosing of sulforaphane (~ 2.5 μmol glucora-
phanin (GR)/lb). Avmacol®, a sulforaphane-producing diet-
ary supplement, was provided at no cost by Nutramax
Laboratories Consumer Care, Inc. (Edgewood, MD). Each
tablet provides a proprietary broccoli seed and broccoli
sprout blend (ERS92®) delivering GR and active myrosin-
ase enzyme and was calculated to deliver at least the same
dose of sulforaphane as in the prior randomized con-
trolled trial in autism [19, 21]. In the prior randomized
controlled trial, participants were provided pure sulfo-
raphane in contrast to the current study, where sulforaph-
ane was delivered as its precursor (GR) along with a
conversion enzyme, myrosinase, which converts GR to
sulforaphane in the body (providing the advantage of
greater stability and a longer shelf life). Prior bioavailability
studies suggest that the GR plus myrosinase is an excellent
and efficient delivery method, but there is variability from
person to person and the prior bioavailability studies were
conducted in adults [21]. At present, there have been no
dose-efficacy trials, so it is unknown what an “optimal”
dose might be. Dosing was adjusted in weight categories
as follows: 32–41 kg (6 tablets = 222 μmol GR/day),
41–50 kg (7 tablets = 259 μmol GR/day), 50–59 kg
(8 tablets = 296 μmol GR/day), 59–68 kg (9 tablets =
333 μmol GR/day), 68–77 kg (10 tablets = 370 μmol
GR/day), 77–86 kg (12 tablets = 444 μmol GR/day),
86–95 kg (13 tablets = 481 μmol GR/day), and 95–105 kg
(15 tablets = 555 μmol GR/day). Caregivers were advised
to administer the tablets once a day in the morning. A sim-
ple grinding device (www.carex.com/item/70071/Ultra-Pill-
Crusher) was provided to all families so that tablets could
be ground and mixed into cold food (yogurt, applesauce,
fruit juice or shakes, etc.), and most families provided
tablets in this manner. All children completed baseline
measures (described below) and provided urine samples
during the same 2-week screening window, and then all
children commenced treatment on the same day (January
21, 2016) (batch enrollment) and finished treatment on
the same day (April 21, 2016).
Objectives and outcomes
The primary goal of the study, defined a priori, was to
determine if any observed changes in symptoms of ASD
were correlated with changes in urinary metabolites. We
hypothesized that sulforaphane treatment would lead to
changes in markers of oxidative stress (or other physio-
logical abnormalities) and that those changes would cor-
relate with clinical improvements.
The two primary outcome measures were changes in
behavior as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist
(ABC) and changes in social function as measured by the
Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS); both scales are com-
monly used outcome measures in clinical trials of inter-
ventions
in
ASD.
Parents/caregivers
were
asked
to
complete both measures at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks
using an online and secure platform.
Urine was collected once during the 2-week window
before treatment initiation and again at the end of the
12-week study period. Parents/caregivers were provided
a sterile urine cup and were asked to collect a first
morning urine (fasting since dinner the day before) and
bring it immediately to their clinic visit, which was also
arranged in the morning. Parents/caregivers were asked
if the child had a medical illness at the time of urine col-
lection, and no children had a current medical illness.
Urine was immediately stored in 2-mL aliquots at − 80 °C.
During the screening visit, children had a brief physical
examination including height and weight to guide the
proper dosing. Sulforaphane study tablets were provided at
the screening visit along with dosing instructions. Parents
were required to complete the intake forms online before
the study coordinator contacted them to inform them to
start taking the study supplement on January 21, 2016.
Safety assessments
Parents/caregivers and teachers were advised to report
any concerns about a new medical problem immediately
to the study investigators, who were available at all times
to receive reports of possible adverse effects. At the 4- and
12-week online questionnaires, parents/caregivers were
asked to report any new medical problems or concerns for
possible side effects.
Metabolomic analyses
All urine samples were sent on dry ice in one batch to
Metabolon (Morrisville, NC). Metabolomics analysis was
conducted at Metabolon as previously described [22].
Briefly, samples were subjected to methanol extraction,
then split into five aliquots for analysis by ultrahigh
performance/mass spectrometry in the positive (two
methods), negative or polar ion modes. Metabolites were
identified by automated comparison of ion features to a
reference library of chemical standards followed by
visual inspection for quality control [23]. For statistical
analyses and data display, any missing values were
assumed to be below the limits of detection; these values
were imputed with the compound minimum (minimum
value imputation). Data was then normalized by mea-
sured osmolality, which is necessary to reduce the
variability in metabolomics analyses due to differing
urine concentrations [24]. A metabolic pathway for a
given metabolite was assigned based on prior designa-
tions in the literature combined with experience from
prior datasets at Metabolon.

 Statistical methods
Summary statistics were used to describe the variables.
Change in both the clinical variables and the metabolites
was computed as post-test minus pre-test. Pearson’s
correlation coefficient was estimated and tested to index
the association between the change in each of the two
clinical scales and the change in each metabolite. Given
the early-stage nature of the research, we did not adjust
for multiple comparisons because we felt it was more
important to risk a type II error than to miss a poten-
tially important signal by being overly conservative, as
has been suggested by prior authors [25].
We defined, a priori, that a correlation cutoff of an
absolute value of ≥ 0.6 was of potential clinical relevance,
because, given our sample size of 15, we would have
approximately 80% power to detect a correlation of that
size and such a correlation accounts for roughly one
third of the variance. Others have suggested that correla-
tions with an absolute value of ≥ 0.6 indicate a moderate
or higher correlation [26] (and are hence of greatest
interest in pointing to a mechanism of action).
We also examined the number of participants who had
a clinical response, defined a priori as an improvement of
four or more points in the ABC. We compared the
pre-post changes in the ABC and SRS in the responder
and non-responder groups using the Student’s t test.
Results
Twenty-one of 35 students who were enrolled in the
school completed the informed consent process for the
study. Six families dropped out prior to completing any
post-baseline information for the following reasons: two
subjects withdrew consent prior to starting for unstated
reasons; two subjects did not like the taste of the supple-
ment; two parents filled out no surveys. The characteristics
of the 15 children who provided follow-up information are
shown in Table 1. All children had a diagnosis of ASD, 80%
were male, the mean age was 14.8, and there were no
known genetic conditions among study participants. Their
baseline ABC hyperactivity and irritability scores (Table 2)
are similar to those in the prior, seminal study of risperidone
for behavioral problems in children with autism and “serious
behavioral disturbances,” where baseline hyperactivity and
irritability scores were 31.8 (vs. 29.4 in the current study)
and 26.2 (vs. 25.0 in the current study), respectively [27].
Changes in symptoms
The change in ABC and SRS scores over the study period
are shown in Table 2. Mean scores on both measures
showed improvements (decreases) over the 3-month study
period, but only the change in the SRS was significant. The
ABC improved − 7.1 points (95% CI − 17.4 to 3.2), and the
SRS improved − 9.7 points (95% CI − 18.7 to − 0.8).
We also examined the number of participants who
had a “clinical response,” defined as an improvement in
four or more points in the ABC. Eight participants had a
clinical response compared to seven who were classified
as non-responders. Responders exhibited a 21.8-point
decrease (improvement) in total ABC (p < 0.001) and a
20.2-point decrease in SRS (p < 0.001), compared to
increases of 10 points in ABC (p = 0.001) and 8 points in
SRS (p = 0.076) for non-responders.
Figure 1 demonstrates the marked improvement at
1-month for the ABC and a more gradual improvement
from 1 to 3 months. The SRS demonstrates a slower
initial improvement at 1 month with continued improve-
ment to a significant change at 3 months.
Parents were asked to provide subjective descriptions
of the changes they noted in their children, and seven
parents provided responses (Table 3).
Correlations between metabolite changes and clinical
changes
The metabolite analysis measured 694 different urinary
metabolites. Table 4 shows all urinary metabolites with
correlations with an absolute value ≥ 0.6 with either the
ABC or the SRS.

 Positive correlations indicate that, as the urinary me-
tabolite increased, the ABC and SRS also increased
(worsened). Negative correlations indicate that, as the
urinary metabolite increased, the ABC and SRS de-
creased (improved). Metabolites that fall into similar,
known metabolic pathways are highlighted and an inter-
pretation is provided in the discussion.
Adverse events
Six families reported that their child had a new medical
event during the study period: one nausea and vomiting
(but also associated with pica), one stomach flu, one inflam-
mation in the esophagus and weight gain, one ruptured
appendix, and one weight loss. The one serious adverse
event (ruptured appendix) required hospitalization and sur-
gery but led to no long-term complications. The committee
on human research review determined that it was unlikely
to be related to the study supplement.
Discussion
This study builds upon findings from one prior randomized,
placebo-controlled trial, which found that the use of

 sulforaphane led to improvements in behavior and social re-
sponsiveness in children and young adults (aged 13–27)
with ASD [19]. Our primary goal was to examine changes
in metabolites in children with ASD who were taking sulfo-
raphane to determine a possible mechanism of action. We
observed that a group of school-age children (mean age
14.8) showed a trend towards improvement in behavior
(ABC) and a statistically significant improvement in social
responsiveness after 12 weeks of treatment. The magnitude
of improvements in the current study (− 9.7 points for the
SRS and − 7.1 points for the ABC) were smaller than in the
prior study (− 20.4 points for the SRS and − 21.4 points for
the ABC), which may be related to the younger age of these
participants or other differences in the study populations.
One important difference in the study populations is that in
the current study, all of the children were attending
one specialized school with programs designed for
children with ASD. The behavioral interventions in
place at the school may have already been producing
positive effects (at baseline) and limited the ability to
detect further improvement from sulforaphane over the
12-week study (when compared to the prior study, where
subjects were not in the same school).
In order to determine which metabolites might mediate
clinical improvements, we examined correlations between
the change in urinary metabolite levels and change in behav-
ior and social responsiveness over the 12-week study. We
defined, a priori, that a correlation with an absolute value of
0.6 or greater was potentially relevant and might indicate a
mechanism of action. Of 694 measured urinary metabolites,
77 had correlations with an absolute value of ≥ 0.6. While it
is not possible to discuss the implications of all of these
correlations, several of these metabolite changes cluster into
known pathways (Table 4) that have been reported to be
altered in children with ASD. These pathways involve
metabolites involved in oxidative stress, amino acid/gut
microbiome, neurotransmitters, hormones/stress response,
and sphingomyelin metabolism, among others. Sulforaphane
may affect these pathways through a variety of mechanisms
including Nrf2-mediated induction of phase 2 detoxification
enzymes, suppression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, induc-
tion of apoptotic pathways, and anti-inflammatory activity
that have been described in detail [28].
Many prior studies have found increased oxidative
stress in children with ASD, which may be due to
increased production or decreased clearance of reactive
oxygen
species
(also
known
as
ROS,
or
oxygen
free-radicals). Children with ASD have been found to
have lower levels of the metabolites that process oxygen
free radicals (methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, homo-
cysteine, cystathionine, cysteine, and total glutathione),
higher levels of metabolites that are involved in the
body’s mechanism for reducing oxidative stress (oxidized
glutathione, adenosine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine), and
markers of protein and DNA oxidative damage [3, 29].
Also, two prior randomized controlled trials—one of the
antioxidant NAC, and one of the methyl donor, methyl
B12—have found that these treatments improve clinical
symptoms in children with ASD [17, 18]. In the methyl
B12 supplementation study, clinical improvements were
correlated with increases in plasma methionine, decreases
in S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH), and improvements in
the ratio of S-adensylmethionine (SAM) to SAH [18].
Interestingly, in the current study, clinical improvements
were correlated with two metabolites known to be in-
volved in redox metabolism. The negative correlations
found with γ-glutamylglutamine and methionine sulfone
indicate that, as the urinary levels of these metabolites in-
creased, the symptoms scores decreased (improved). This
suggests that sulforaphane may mediate beneficial clinical
effects through increases in antioxidant capacity, which is
one of its well-documented physiological effects [20].
Abnormalities in amino acid metabolism have been re-
ported in children with ASD compared to control children
[9, 12, 14, 16], and this may be related to altered processing
of amino acids by gut microbiota [30]. We found correla-
tions between clinical improvement and the amino acids
tryptophan,
tyrosine,
and
assymetric-dimethylarginine
(ADMA, a derivative of the amino acid, arginine). The in-
volvement of altered amino acids in the pathology of ASD
is plausible since amino acids are building blocks for many
key neurotransmitters and hormones, including catechol-
amines and serotonin [30]. Six prior studies using urinary
metabolomics noted increased urinary tryptophan in chil-
dren with ASD [7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 30], and tryptophan is a
key substrate in the serotonergic metabolic pathway. For
tryptophan, tyrosine, and ADMA, the correlations in the
current study were all negative, indicating that as the
urinary levels of these amino acids increased, symptom
scores decreased (improved). We also identified correla-
tions between clinical improvement and changes in a num-
ber of other amino acids that are known to be associated

 category had positive correlations, indicating that decreased
urinary levels were associated with improved clinical symp-
toms. It is not yet clear how sulforaphane may affect or
improve the amino acid abnormalities (including those
associated with the gut microbiome) and lead to clinical
improvements.
We also found associations between clinical improve-
ments and changes in five urinary neurotransmitter-related
metabolites,
including
N-methylglutamate,
glutamine,
hypoxanthine, serotonin, and homovanillate (HMV), which
is the normal end product of dopamine degradation and
was elevated in the urine of children with ASD in a prior
study [14]. For all of the urinary neurotransmitters except
N-methylglutamate, the correlations were negative, indicat-
ing that increases in the urinary levels of these metabolites
were associated with lower scores on the ABC and SRS and
therefore improved symptoms. This suggests that either
increased production or increased elimination of these me-
tabolites is correlated with beneficial effects. Hypoxanthine,
which is part of the purine pathway, was previously found
to be elevated in children with ASD [9]. We also found that
urinary glutamine was correlated with clinical improve-
ments. Glutamatergic dysfunction has been hypothesized to
be involved in the pathogenesis of ASD, with several studies
reporting abnormal levels of glutamate in various regions in
the brain [13].

 We found correlations between clinical improvements
and a large number of hormones, some of them
stress-related. Prior studies have found higher salivary
stress hormones in children with ASD and higher hair
cortisol levels, suggesting both acute and chronic elevation
in stress hormones [31, 32]. Higher hair cortisol levels
were associated with more severe autism symptoms and
anxiety [31]. In the current study, both cortisone and
cortisol-21-glucuronide had negative correlations with
ASD-related behavior, indicating that increased urinary
levels were associated with improved symptoms. ASD
behavior and social responsiveness were also related to a
large number of other hormones, and all of these correla-
tions were negative, again indicating that increased urinary
levels of various hormones were associated with improved
symptoms. It is not clear if this indicates that increased
production or increased excretion is associated with im-
provement, but it highlights changes in hormonal function
in ASD as an area for further study.
A novel finding of the current study is that improve-
ment in behavior was correlated with seven different
chemical forms of sphingomyelin. Seven sphingomyelin
metabolites were each strongly negatively correlated
with behavior, such that increased urinary levels were
associated with improved behavior. Sphingomyelin is a
sphingolipid found in animal cell membranes, especially
in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds nerve
cells and axons. To our knowledge, there have been no
prior reports of abnormalities in sphingolipid levels in
children with ASD, but there are numerous studies
documenting abnormalities in the size, number, and
morphology of dendrites in autism, which is related to
altered synapse function [33]. Furthermore, sphingomye-
lin abnormalities have been noted in a number of other
central nervous system disorders, including depression,
anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, suggesting that it may have a central role in
normal brain development and function [34–37]. It is
not clear how sulforaphane might alter sphingomyelin
metabolism or availability and whether this is related to
clinical benefits, but if this association is confirmed, it
has important clinical and treatment implications.
The current study has a number of limitations. Im-
portantly, this was a pilot study to investigate whether
metabolomics might be a useful tool to suggest pathways
that may be involved in the mechanism of action of
treatments (in this case, sulforaphane) in ASD. The
study was open label and parent raters may have rated
more positively knowing that their child was taking the
sulforaphane, although the magnitude of benefit is lower
than in the one prior randomized controlled trial. The
ratings were also limited to the ABC and SRS to
minimize respondent burden, and while these are widely
used outcome tools in ASD, we did not include other
measures of repetitive behavior or adaptive function,
which might have shown clinical changes in other im-
portant areas. Many factors affect urinary metabolomics,
including diet, environment, stress, sleep, age, and other
factors. In the current study, the wide age range (7–21),
different gender and pubertal state of subjects and the
small sample size all limit the strength of the conclu-
sions regarding urinary metabolomic changes. The vari-
ation in these environmental effects may have been
minimized by having all the children attending the same
school 5 days a week. However, the findings of this study
should be viewed as hypothesis generating and should
be confirmed in future studies with larger sample sizes.
Future studies would also benefit from plasma biochem-
ical
assessments
of
antioxidant
status
pre-
and
post-treatment since this is likely a key pathway in the
mechanism of action of sulforaphane. We found that
change in the two outcome measures, ABC and SRS,
were associated with mostly different metabolites. We
believe this is to be expected since the measures assess
different components of human behavior and are likely
influenced by different metabolic pathways. Finally, we
used a different delivery method of sulforaphane than in
a prior randomized controlled trial in autism [19] by
providing a precursor, glucoraphanin, along with a con-
version enzyme, myrosinase. Although the dosing was
designed to produce a similar level of sulforaphane, it is
possible that differences in bioavailable sulforaphane
levels between the two studies could have led to differ-
ences in clinical results.
Conclusions
We are not aware of any prior studies that have exam-
ined changes in urinary metabolites during a clinical trial
of a treatment for autism. In this pilot study, we demon-
strated the feasibility of using metabolomics to identify
urinary metabolites that are correlated with clinical im-
provements and might therefore represent a mechanism
of action. One group of metabolites in particular, the
sphingolipid/sphingomyelin group, was highlighted as
being significantly associated with improvement. Other
urinary metabolite changes that were correlated with
clinical improvement are related to oxidative stress,
amino acid metabolism/gut microbiome metabolites,
neurotransmitters, stress, and other hormones. These
findings suggest that urinary metabolomics may be a
tool to identify important changes in the quest to deter-
mine how certain biological interventions work to re-
duce specific symptoms of ASD. This may further
provide clues to the underlying, active pathophysiology
of ASD and may allow for more precise interventions
targeted to the unique metabolome of each individual
with this disorder.
