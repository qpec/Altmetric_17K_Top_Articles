IMPORTANCE In August 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
flibanserin as a treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal
women, despite concern about suboptimal risk-benefit trade-offs.
OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials
assessing efficacy and safety of flibanserin for the treatment of HSDD in women.
DATA SOURCES Medical databases (among others, Embase, Medline, Psycinfo) and trial
registries were searched from inception to June 17, 2015. Reference lists of retrieved studies
were searched for additional publications.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials assessing treatment effects of flibanserin in
premenopausal and postmenopausal women were eligible. No age, language, or date
restrictions were applied. Abstract and full-text selection was done by 2 independent
reviewers.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by
a second reviewer. Results were pooled using 2 approaches depending on the blinding risk
of bias.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary efficacy outcomes included number of satisfying
sexual events (SSEs), eDiary sexual desire, and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) desire.
Safety outcomes included, among others, 4 common adverse events (AEs): dizziness,
somnolence, nausea, and fatigue.
RESULTS Five published and 3 unpublished studies including 5914 women were included.
Pooled mean differences for SSE change from baseline were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.32-0.67)
between 100-mg flibanserin and placebo, 1.63 (95% CI, 0.45-2.82) for eDiary desire, and
0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.38) for FSFI desire. The risk ratio for study discontinuation due to AEs
was 2.19 (95% CI, 1.50-3.20). The risk ratio for dizziness was 4.00 (95% CI, 2.56-6.27) in
flibanserin vs placebo, 3.97 (95% CI, 3.01-5.24) for somnolence, 2.35 (95% CI, 1.85-2.98) for
nausea, and 1.64 (95% CI, 1.27-2.13) for fatigue. Women’
s mean global impression of
improvement scores indicated minimal improvement to no change.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Treatment with flibanserin, on average, resulted in one-half
additional SSE per month while statistically and clinically significantly increasing the risk of
dizziness, somnolence, nausea, and fatigue. Overall, the quality of the evidence was graded
as very low. Before flibanserin can be recommended in guidelines and clinical practice, future
studies should include women from diverse populations, particularly women with
comorbidities, medication use, and surgical menopause.

I
n August 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved flibanserin as a medical treatment for hypoac-
tive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal
women.1 Flibanserin, a 5-HT1A agonist, a 5-HT2A antagonist,
and a very weak partial agonist on dopamine D4 receptors, in-
creases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine and de-
creases serotonin in animal brain areas.2,3 Therefore, since
dopamine and norepinephrine are thought to promote and
serotonin is thought to inhibit sexual desire and arousal,3,4 it

Several narrative reviews and commentaries have been
published, providing a complete or partial overview of bio-
medical and integrative treatment options for HSDD.8,10-17 To
our knowledge, no studies have comprehensively summa-
rized the evidence regarding the beneficial and harmful treat-
ment effects of flibanserin for women with HSDD. Therefore,
in view of these controversies and the availability of this new
prescription drug, we aimed to assess efficacy and safety of
flibanserin for the treatment of HSDD in women by perform-
ing a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
clinical trials.
Methods
Search Strategy and Inclusion Criteria
We conducted a systematic search of 3 trial registries and 13
electronic databases (including Embase.com, Medline [Ovid],
and Psycinfo) from inception to June 17, 2015, to identify all
studiesassessingefficacyandsafetyofflibanserinforthetreat-
ment of women with HSDD. The search strategy for each da-
tabase was designed by an experienced medical information
specialist (eMethods 1 in the Supplement).
A stepwise selection procedure was followed (eFigure 1 in
theSupplement).Eligiblestudiesincludedinterventionalstud-
ies assessing efficacy and safety of flibanserin in women with
HSDD or sexual interest/arousal disorder (eMethods 2 in the
Supplement). Studies in premenopausal and postmenopausal
women were eligible, given the potential off-label use in post-
menopausal women.7 Studies assessing any outcome measure
wereeligible;outcomemeasuresincluded,amongothers,change
frombaselineinnumberofsatisfyingsexualevents(SSEs),sexual
desire,anddistressrelatedtodesire;adverseevents(AEs)lead-
ing to study discontinuation; specific AEs including dizziness,
somnolence, nausea, and fatigue and serious AEs. No age, lan-
guage, or date restrictions were applied.
Study Selection
Two independent researchers reviewed all abstracts and reg-
isteredtrialsandselectedpotentiallyeligiblestudies.Fulltexts
of these studies were retrieved to assess fulfilment of the se-
lection criteria. Disagreements were resolved through con-
sensus or consultation of a third reviewer. The references of
the retrieved studies were scanned to identify additional pub-
lications that were missed by the initial search.
Data Extraction
A data collection form was prepared to extract all relevant in-
formation from the included studies. Extracted data in-
cluded period of surveillance, country, funding source, par-
ticipant characteristics (age, menopausal status, duration of
HSDD, and other characteristics), dose regimens, and partici-
pant flow. Furthermore, baseline and end of follow-up levels
of the outcomes were extracted. A second researcher checked
the extracted data.
In cases of missing data, the clinicaltrials.gov website and
theAdvisoryCommitteeBriefingDocumentswereconsulted.18
In 5 cases, we contacted authors and in all cases the owner of
flibanserin, Sprout Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Quality Evaluation
The quality of the evidence per outcome was graded accord-
ing to the recommendations of the Grades of Recommenda-
tion, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)
Working Group, and included consideration of within-study
risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence,
heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of publication bias.19 The
within-study risk of bias was assessed by 2 researchers inde-
pendently using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool.19
Since the number of eligible studies was smaller than 10,
assessing publication bias with funnel plots was not feasible.19
Efficacy and Safety Outcomes
Primary efficacy outcomes included number of SSEs per
month, monthly sexual desire intensity (eDiary desire; Invi-
vodata Inc), and Female Sexual Function Index20 desire
Key Points
Question: What is the efficacy and safety of flibanserin for the
treatment of women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder?
Findings: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 published
and 3 unpublished clinical trials found that treatment with
flibanserin resulted in one-half additional satisfying sexual event
per month while statistically and clinically significantly increasing
the risk of dizziness, somnolence, nausea, and fatigue.
Meaning: The clinical benefits of flibanserin are marginal, with
statistically and clinically significant adverse effects.

domain (FSFI desire). Five efficacy outcomes were labeled as
secondary: FSFI total score, Female Sexual Distress Scale–
Revised Item 13 and total score,21 Patient’
s Global Impression
of Improvement, and Patient Benefit Evaluation.
Safety outcomes included any AEs, investigator-defined
drug-related AEs, AEs leading to study discontinuation, the 4
most common AEs (dizziness, somnolence, nausea, and fa-
tigue), and severe and serious AEs.
Statistical Methods
Heterogeneity permitting, we sought to pool the results of
women using 100-mg doses of flibanserin (100 mg once daily
at bedtime or 50 mg twice daily) vs women using placebo via
fixed and random effects models. Heterogeneity was as-
sessedusingCochraneχ2andI2statistics.Randomeffectsmod-
els were used in cases of clinical heterogeneity (differences in
study inclusion criteria) or statistical heterogeneity (I2 ≥ 40%
or a significant test for heterogeneity). In all other cases, fixed
effects models were used.
Adequately blinded studies (eMethods 3 in the Supple-
ment) were summarized using the inverse variance weighted
mean difference and 95% CI for continuous outcomes, and the
risk difference or risk ratio and 95% CI for dichotomous out-
comes. For inadequately blinded studies, we presented out-
comes for flibanserin and placebo groups separately.22,23
In cases of missing data for the number in analysis or stan-
darderror(SE),forefficacyoutcomesthenumberofstudycom-
pletersandthelargestoutcome-specificSEfromtheotherstud-
ies were imputed, respectively; a conservative approach given
its modest effect on study size, weighting, and precision es-
timates. For safety outcomes, the number of study starters was
used, given that dropout, among other reasons, was likely to
be related to AEs.
We performed 3 subgroup analyses, one in premeno-
pausalwomenonly,asecondfortheFDA-approveddoseof100
mgoncedailyatbedtime,andathirdcomparingpublishedand
unpublished studies.
In sensitivity analyses, the smallest outcome-specific SE
was taken, and the numbers of study completers and study
starters were replaced by each other in efficacy and safety as-
sessments, respectively. Furthermore, to detect the influ-
ence of a single study on the overall meta-analysis, the stud-
ies were omitted 1 by 1.
AllstatisticaldataanalyseswereperformedusingStataSta-
tistical Software: Release 12 (StataCorp LP).
Results
Of 592 references and registered trials initially identified, 8
studies were included in the qualitative assessment, and 4 to
7 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis, depend-
ing on how many studies reported each outcome (eFigure 1 in
the Supplement). Three studies were unpublished trials con-
ducted between 2006 and 2011: Alternate Dose Study
(NCT00360243), EU Study (NCT00491829), and Terminated
Study (NCT01057901) (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The
remaining 5 studies were published between 2011 and 2014:
DeRogatis et al24 (NCT00360529), Goldfischer et al25
(NCT00277914), Katz et al26 (NCT00996164), Simon et al27
(NCT00996372), and Thorp et al28 (NCT00360555).
General Characteristics of the Included Studies
All studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials performed in the United States and Canada,
except for 1 study, which was performed in 13 European coun-
tries. All studies included premenopausal (6 studies) or post-
menopausal women (2 studies) with generalized acquired
HSDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) and for whom
the diagnosis was ascertained by a trained clinician via a di-
agnostic interview (Table 1). No studies were found for women
with sexual interest/arousal disorder. Furthermore, all women
were in stable, heterosexual, monogamous relationships for
at least 1 year. Most studies included a dosing regimen of 100
mg of flibanserin once daily at bedtime.
Overall, at least 7914 women were assigned to any treat-
ment arm, and 5914 women completed the various trials. An
overview of study participant flow and number of dropouts
per reason is provided in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
General Characteristics of the Study Participants
Five studies reported characteristics of the study partici-
pants (eTable 3 in the Supplement). These characteristics did
not differ between studies or treatment arms except for the
mean (SD) age of 36.1 (6.7) years and 55.5 (5.4) years in pre-
menopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively. Mean
(SD) BMI was 26.9 (5.8), and nearly 90% of participants were
white. No information was found on level of education and so-
cioeconomic status. Study exclusion criteria specified an ex-
tensive list of diseases and medications.
Women’
s mean (SD) number of baseline SSEs per month
was 2.5 (2.6) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Baseline eDiary de-
sire (scale 0-84) was 11.5 (9.3), and FSFI desire (scale 1.2-6.0)
was 1.8 (0.7).
Quality Evaluation
Even though all studies were randomized clinical trials, the
overall quality of the evidence for both efficacy and safety out-
comes was very low (Table 2). The summary of the within-
study risk of bias assessment can be found in eTables 5 through
7 in the Supplement.
Beneficial Treatment Effects
An overview of reported efficacy and safety outcomes is pro-
vided in Table 3. For all efficacy outcomes, it was feasible to
pool the results except for Patient’
s Global Impression of Im-
provement (eTable 8 in the Supplement).

The pooled mean difference for change in mean SSEs from
baseline was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.32-0.67) between 100-mg flib-
anserin and placebo (Figure 1A). In premenopausal women
only, this was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.38-0.92) (eTable 9 in the Supple-
ment), and in studies using the FDA-approved 100-mg once-
daily dose, this was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.35-0.73) (eTable 10 in the
Supplement). For published studies, the mean difference for
SSEs was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.37-0.80), and for unpublished stud-
ies, this was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.00-0.62) (eTable 11 in the Supple-
ment). The mean difference for eDiary desire score mean
changefrombaseline,whichwasonlymeasuredinstudieswith
premenopausal women, was 1.63 (95% CI, 0.45-2.82)
(Figure 1B). For FSFI desire, this was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.38)
in all women (Figure 1C). All primary and secondary efficacy
outcomes (eFigure 2 in the Supplement) showed a statisti-
cally significant difference between 100-mg flibanserin vs pla-
cebo (P < .001) in main analyses. An overview of the meta-
analysis results for the efficacy outcomes in flibanserin and
placebo groups separately can be found in eTable 12 in the
Supplement.
Harmful Treatment Effects
All except 2 safety outcomes were feasible to pool, and all
studies assessed the effect of 100-mg flibanserin once daily
vs placebo. The risk for any AEs, which also included non–
drug-related AEs such as common cold, was 1.29 (95% CI,
1.15-1.45) times higher for flibanserin than for placebo
(eFigure 3A in the Supplement). Investigator-defined drug-
related AEs were reported by 2 studies and ranged from
29.9% to 36.5% for flibanserin and from 12.7% to 15.8% for
placebo. The risk for study discontinuation owing to AEs was
2.19 (95% CI, 1.50-3.20) times higher for flibanserin than for
placebo, but this outcome was only reported in 4 studies
(eFigure 3B in the Supplement).
The risk for dizziness was 4.00 (95% CI, 2.56-6.27) times
higherwithflibanserinthanwithplacebo;forsomnolence,3.97
(95% CI, 3.01-5.24) times higher with flibanserin; for nausea,
2.35 (95% CI, 1.85-2.98) times higher with flibanserin; and for
fatigue, 1.64 (95% CI, 1.27-2.13) times higher with flibanserin
(Figure 2). The overall risk ratio for the 4 most common AEs
was 2.86 (95% CI, 2.32-3.52). Severe AEs, defined as being in-
capacitating or causing inability to work or undertake activ-
ity, such as syncope, hypotension, injury, and severe mani-
festations of AEs such as somnolence and dizziness, were
reportedby2studies;inflibanserinusers,thepercentageswere
4.2% and 6.0%, and 3.5% in controls. Serious AEs were de-
fined as those resulting in death, those that were immedi-
ately life-threatening, those that required longer-lasting hos-
pitalization,orthoseweredeemedseriousforanyotherreason;
these included, among others, appendicitis, cholelithiasis, and
concussion.29 The absolute number of serious AEs was small,
and the risk ratio did not differ between flibanserin and pla-
cebo users (1.48 [95% CI, 0.91-2.41]) (eFigure 3C in the Supple-
ment). All safety outcomes, except serious AEs, showed a

statistically significant difference between 100-mg fliban-
serin vs placebo (P < .001) in main analyses.
None of the studies was found to be too influential on the
overall effect size when omitted 1 by 1. The direction, size, and
significance of the associations remained the same in the sen-
sitivity analyses performed based on the assumptions made
regarding the imputation process detailed in the Methods sec-
tion (eTable 13 in the Supplement).
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes 5 pub-
lished and 3 unpublished studies investigating efficacy and
safety of flibanserin for the treatment of HSDD in nearly 6000
women. Treatment with flibanserin, on average, resulted in
one-half an additional SSE per month while statistically and
clinically significantly increasing the risk of dizziness, som-
nolence, nausea, and fatigue. Overall, the quality of the evi-
dence was graded as very low for efficacy and safety out-
comes, particularly due to limitations in design, indirectness
of evidence, and more favorable efficacy outcomes in pub-
lished compared with unpublished studies.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and
meta-analysis addressing the impact of flibanserin treatment
in women with HSDD. The most important question con-
cerns the clinical relevance of the statistically significant ef-
ficacy outcomes,30 particularly considering AEs that could
worsen with concurrent alcohol intake or CYP3A4 inhibitors,
including oral contraceptives and fluconazole.7,31 Clinical sig-
nificance was evaluated by assessing the magnitude of effect
sizesandbypatient-reportedminimumrelevantdifferenceand
self-perceived meaningful benefit.30,32
The data presented in this review suggest that the mean-
ingful change caused by flibanserin is minimal. First, for the
range of 0.5-1.0 increase in SSEs reported by the FDA,33 fre-
quently referenced by scientific articles and mass media, the
difference in SSEs change per month in our review was at the
lowerendofthisrangeinmain,subgroup,andsensitivityanaly-
ses(eTables9through11andeTable13intheSupplement).Sec-
ond, the perceived minimum important difference for the SSE
eDiary in postmenopausal women ranged from 0.16-1.84 per

Within-study risk of bias
Serious limitation.
The quality was downgraded because the risk of bias of
the included studies was unclear or high (eTables 5, 6,
and 7 in the Supplement). Of particular concern was
the shift of primary end point from eDiary desire to
FSFI desire. Furthermore, dropout rates were high, and
it remained unclear how many responses were used to
extrapolate the SSE to a 28-day period.
Serious limitation.
The quality was downgraded because the risk of bias
of the included studies was unclear or high (eTable 5,
6, and 7 in the Supplement). Of particular concern
was that the investigator-defined drug-related and
severe AEs were provided in only 2 studies and that
dropout rates were high.
Indirectness evidence
Serious limitation.
Women with a wide range of diseases and medication
uses were excluded from study participation.
Furthermore, women were, on average, overweight,
and they might represent a higher functioning group
given the base rate of 2.5 SSEs per month and their
willingness to engage in sexual activity at least once
per month. Finally, the dropout rate was higher in the
flibanserin than the placebo arm.

by menopausal status (I2 = 32.2%, P = .22) in
premenopausal women only. Substantial
heterogeneity occurred for any AEs (I2 = 79.9%,
P < .001). Indeed, any AEs consisted of a very
heterogenous group of AEs, including the 4 most
common AEs, but also events like upper respiratory
tract infection, which could vary seasonally.
Imprecision
No limitation.
Serious limitation.
Both in the individual studies and to a lesser extent
in the overall effect size for particularly dizziness,
somnolence, and AEs leading to study
discontinuation, the confidence intervals were wide.
Publication bias
Serious limitation.
Three of 8 studies were results from unpublished trials,
of which the primary completion year ranged from
2008 to 2011.

a Unless otherwise indicated, flibanserin was administered in a single 100-mg dose at bedtime.
bThis study used flibanserin, 50 mg, twice daily.
c This study was terminated early by the study sponsor for commercial reasons and has no published
peer-reviewed report or abstract, but results are reported at clinicaltrials.gov. The premature study termination
could have resulted in inadequate power for analysis of the individual study.
dThis study started with a 24-week open-label period, after which only women who showed a predefined
improvement were randomized to a 24-week double-blind period. Data were provided only for 3 flibanserin
dose arms combined: 100 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily, and 50 mg once daily.
e Scales of efficacy outcomes: SSE, number per 4 weeks; eDiary desire, score per 4 weeks (scale, 0-84);

month.34 Hence, the mean difference for change in SSE per
month in this study was also at the lower end of this spec-
trum (Figure 1A). Patient Benefit Evaluation and Patient’
s
Global Impression of Improvement measured overall subjec-
tively experienced improvement. The difference in experi-
enced meaningful benefit between flibanserin users and con-
trols was small, ranging from minimal improvement to no
change (eTable 8 and eFigure 2D in the Supplement).
The most common reported AEs were of mild and mod-
erate intensity, and serious AEs were equally low in fliban-
serin and placebo users. This reflects positively on fliban-
serin’s safety, but the conclusion that flibanserin is safe is
premature. Investigator-defined drug-related AEs and severe
AEs were underreported (2 studies each). Severe AEs in-
cluded, among others, syncope and hypotension. Both can oc-
cur with flibanserin use alone but are amplified with concur-
rent alcohol use and were labeled by the FDA as serious safety
concerns.33 In an open-label extension study including 1723
women with a median follow-up of 1 year, 723 participants
(43%) reported investigator-defined drug-related AEs, and
143 (8.3%) reported severe AEs.35 The continued safety (and
efficacy) of flibanserin with long-term use remains to be
established.

using broad search terms, and the inclusion of published and
unpublished work, allowed us to provide a comprehensive
overview of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of fliban-
serin for the treatment of women with HSDD. The inclusion
of studies focusing on postmenopausal women took into ac-
count the potential off-label use. Furthermore, the extensive
quality evaluation may facilitate the discussion of not only ef-
ficacy and safety of flibanserin, but also of reliability of the evi-
dence put forward by the studies included in this review.
A limitation was the fact that the studies were light on de-
tails.Thisaffectedtheaccuracyofthequalityevaluation(many
within-study risk of bias domains remained with unclear risk)
and the completeness of the meta-analyses (some outcomes
were not feasible to meta-analyze and some meta-analyses did
not include all studies). Therefore, some caution is required
when interpreting the results of these assessments. The most
important lacking data included blinding ascertainment, num-
ber in analyses, and completeness (effect and precision esti-
mate) of every outcome. Contacting study investigators and
study sponsor did not generate additional information. There-
fore, given the unclear risk of bias for blinding, results were

ings with each, which generates confidence with regard to the
reliability of the findings. Also, missing values were imputed
to limit introduction of bias and proved robust in sensitivity
analyses.
As women with a wide range of medication uses, dis-
eases (including psychological comorbidities), and women not
in a stable, communicative, heterosexual relationship were
excluded from participation, the generalizability of the find-
ings may be limited.36 Because overall, study participants were
overweight,resultsmaynotbegeneralizabletowomeninother
BMI categories. In addition, it is unclear to what extent they
represent typical women with HSDD, given that they had a
baseline of 2.5 SSEs per month and had to be willing to en-
gage in sexual activity once a month to be eligible to partici-
pate.BecausetheactualbaserateofSSEsinwomenwithHSDD
is unknown, it is possible that the included women represent
a higher functioning group, and conclusions may not be valid
for all women with HSDD.22
Conclusions
With nearly 90% of American physicians indicating that they
would prescribe an approved HSDD pharmacological product
over available nonpharmacological treatments,37 the need for
sound evidence on the efficacy and safety profile of flibanserin
is evident. The findings of this review suggest that the benefits
of flibanserin treatment are marginal, particularly when taking
into account the concurrent occurrence of AEs. It has been
suggested that women with HSDD would benefit most from an
integrative approach, including, medical, psychiatric, psycho-
logical,couple-relationship,andsocioculturaldomains:thebio-
psychosocialmodel.11,17Beforeflibanserincanberecommended
inguidelinesandclinicalpractice,futurestudiesshouldinclude
women from diverse populations, particularly women with
(ahistoryof)somaticandpsychologicalcomorbidities,medica-
tion use, and surgical menopause.
