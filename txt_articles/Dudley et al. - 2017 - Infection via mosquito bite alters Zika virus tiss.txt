Mouse and nonhuman primate models now serve as useful platforms to study Zika virus
(ZIKV) pathogenesis, candidate therapies, and vaccines, but they rely on needle inoculation
of virus: the effects of mosquito-borne infection on disease outcome have not been explored
in these models. Here we show that infection via mosquito bite delays ZIKV replication to
peak viral loads in rhesus macaques. Importantly, in mosquito-infected animals ZIKV tissue
distribution was limited to hemolymphatic tissues, female reproductive tract tissues, kidney,
and liver, potentially emulating key features of human ZIKV infections, most of which are
characterized by mild or asymptomatic disease. Furthermore, deep sequencing analysis
reveals that ZIKV populations in mosquito-infected monkeys show greater sequence het-
erogeneity and lower overall diversity than in needle-inoculated animals. This newly devel-
oped system will be valuable for studying ZIKV disease because it more closely mimics
human infection by mosquito bite than needle-based inoculations.

 Z
ika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is primarily
transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, but animal
models of ZIKV pathogenesis have relied on needle
inoculation1–7. Needle inoculation has been performed using a
range of doses, delivered subcutaneously at a single site or at
multiple sites, as well as intravenously, intravaginally, intrarec-
tally, and intra-amniotically in pregnant animals. Each of these
routes and inoculum doses could modulate viral infection kinetics
and viral tissue distribution on their own, but none of them
entirely recapitulate vector delivery of the virus. Blood feeding by
a mosquito ensures delivery of the virus to an anatomically
precise target in the dermis of the skin8–10. When a mosquito
feeds it inserts its proboscis into the skin and then actively probes
within the tissue for blood. When blood is found, the mosquito
begins feeding either directly from the vessel or from the resulting
hemorrhage. Importantly, the majority of the inoculum delivered
by a mosquito while probing and feeding is deposited extra-
vascularly11 and only a small amount (~102 plaque-forming units
(PFU)) is deposited intravascularly12. Throughout this process, a
mosquito injects saliva into the host. The saliva of hematophages,
including mosquitoes, is a cocktail of potent pharmacologically
active components that prevents clotting and causes vasodilation,
as well as alters the inflammatory and immune response, to help
facilitate blood feeding13–15.
Pathogens such as ZIKV exploit this system to infect new
vertebrate hosts. Mosquito saliva enhances the replication and
pathogenesis of numerous arthropod-borne viruses16–21. Fur-
thermore, mosquito saliva has been shown to alter virus dis-
semination in mammalian hosts for other arboviruses such as
dengue virus and Semliki Forest virus22, 23. Therefore, saliva
delivered to the host by a mosquito may have a critical impact on
the initial infection in the skin and may modulate the local innate
and adaptive immune response. Accordingly, needle delivery may
fail to fully recapitulate important biological parameters of nat-
ural ZIKV infection. In addition, the delivery of isolated, purified
pathogens by needle inoculation can introduce significant arti-
facts into the system: for example, directly inoculated virus stocks
contain cell culture components not found in mosquito saliva. In
sum, it is impossible to replicate the biological, physiological, and
mechanical phenomena of mosquito feeding and/or probing
using a needle.
The amount of ZIKV inoculated by mosquitoes into a host is
not known. In the majority of our previous studies we used an
inoculum dose of 1 × 104 PFU injected subcutaneously (sc)1, 2, 24,
which we chose as a dose likely to be delivered by a ZIKV-
infected mosquito. This was based on previous studies, which
found that mosquitoes delivered ~1 × 104–1 × 106 PFU of West
Nile virus (WNV)12 and as much as 1 × 104 50% mosquito
infectious doses of dengue virus (DENV)25. Other recent studies
of ZIKV infection in nonhuman primates have relied on a variety
of doses and routes with varying outcomes. For example, five sc
inoculations each containing 1 × 107 PFU (a 50-fold higher
cumulative dose than any other published study) of a Cambodian
strain of ZIKV in a pregnant pigtail macaque (Macaca nemes-
trina) resulted in severe fetal neurodevelopmental abnormalities
not seen in other studies using a smaller dose of different ZIKV
strains5. In rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca mulatta
and Macaca fascicularis, respectively), ZIKV RNA persisted in
saliva and seminal fluids for at least three weeks after clearance of
the virus from the peripheral blood following sc inoculation with
1 × 106 PFU of a Thai ZIKV isolate26. Our studies using the same
route and doses ranging from 1 × 104 to 1 × 106 PFU of a French
Polynesian isolate showed no persistence in body fluids after the
resolution of acute plasma viremia in non-pregnant macaques2.
In yet another study in rhesus macaques, intravenous adminis-
tration of 1 × 105 PFU of a Brazilian ZIKV isolate resulted in a
short-lived plasma viremia and vRNA distribution in a variety of
tissues two weeks post-infection7. Altogether, these studies
established that Asian/American lineage ZIKV infection of rhesus
macaques provides a relevant animal model for studying natural
history and pathogenesis in a host that has salient similarities to
human pregnancy and biology. But they also highlight that dif-
ferences in route, dose and virus strain may lead to different
outcomes. Although no studies to date have addressed whether
infection via needle inoculation fundamentally differs from
infection via a mosquito vector, transmission of ZIKV via mos-
quito was attempted in 1956 in Nigeria, but only seroconversion
was observed27.
Here, we show that ZIKV-infected Ae. aegypti can reliably
initiate systemic ZIKV infections in rhesus macaques. To assess
differences in ZIKV replication between virus delivery by needle
vs. mosquito vector, we infected rhesus macaques with the Puerto
Rican ZIKV isolate PRVABC59 by either sc inoculation (n = 3) or
by exposure to infected mosquitoes (n = 4). All three sc-
inoculated macaques were productively infected, with viral load
dynamics similar to what we have reported previously1, 2. All four
animals exposed to Ae. aegypti were also productively infected,
with noticeable differences in peak viral load and the time to peak
viral load.
Results
Mosquito-bite delivery of ZIKV results in systemic infection.
To generate ZIKV-infected mosquitoes, adult female Ae. aegypti
were fed on ZIKV-infected Ifnar−/− mice. Twelve days (d) post-
feeding (PF), these same mosquitoes then were allowed to feed on
ZIKV-naive macaques. All macaques (n = 4) exposed to probing
and/or feeding of ZIKV-exposed mosquitoes developed systemic
infections as measured by the presence of vRNA in blood plasma
(Fig. 1). Since not all mosquitoes bite animals under experimental
conditions, we used visual engorgement with blood as a sign of
biting and injection of ZIKV. All mosquitoes that fed took a full
bloodmeal (indicated by a fully engorged, distended abdomen)

 and only those mosquitoes that fed also probed. One macaque
(328696) received 18 bites, one macaque (349332) received 8
bites, and two macaques (268283 and 458001) received five bites.
After macaque feeding, mosquito vector competence for ZIKV
was tested on a subset of the same Ae. aegypti (n = 40) using an
in vitro transmission assay28, 29 at 12 d PF, the same timepoint as
the mosquitoes fed on the macaques. As expected, the infection
(90%) and dissemination (83%) rates were high for Ae. aegypti
exposed to ZIKV-infected mice, while the transmission rate was
more moderate (25%; Table 1). Infection efficiency indicates the
proportion of mosquitoes with virus-positive bodies among the
tested ones. Dissemination efficiency indicates the proportion of
mosquitoes with virus-positive legs, and transmission efficiency
indicates the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious saliva
among the tested ones. We used plaque assays on collected saliva
to estimate the ZIKV dose inoculated by mosquitoes and found
that Ae. aegypti saliva titers ranged from 101.5 to 103.2 PFU
(Fig. 2). Importantly, collection of mosquito saliva via capillary
feeding does not allow mosquitoes to probe and feed naturally
and therefore likely underestimates the dose of virus inoculated.
In fact, mosquitoes probing and feeding on a living host delivered
doses of other flaviviruses that were 10-fold to 1000-fold higher
than those measured using in vitro methods12.
Mosquito transmission delays time to peak viral load. To
examine whether viral replication kinetics differed between virus
delivery from a needle and delivery from a mosquito vector, we
compared viral load dynamics in sc-inoculated animals and
animals infected via mosquito bites. There were noticeable dif-
ferences in peak viral load and the time to peak viral load (Fig. 1).
Viral loads in macaques sc-inoculated with 1 × 104 PFU of ZIKV-
PR peaked in all three animals at 3 days post infection (d.p.i.),
and ranged from 9.32 × 104 to 3.85 × 105 vRNA copies/ml, while
viral loads peaked at 5 or 6 d.p.i. and ranged from 5.83 × 104 to
4.40 × 106 vRNA copies/ml in animals that received mosquito
bites. Peak viral loads did not differ significantly (Student’s t-test)
between sc-inoculated animals and mosquito-bitten animals
(p-value = 0.305, t-value = 1.144, df = 5); however, peak viral load
occurred significantly faster in sc-inoculated animals (linear
mixed-effects model; p-value = 0.006, t-value = −7.606, df = 5).
Antibody responses were generated rapidly in both sc-inoculated
and mosquito-bitten animals, with detectable changes in IgM as
early as 10 d.p.i. (Supplementary Table 1).
Mosquito transmission alters ZIKV tissue tropism. To assess
whether vRNA levels and tissue tropism differed after virus
delivery from needle vs. delivery by mosquito vector, we used
quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT–PCR) to measure
ZIKV RNA in homogenized macaque tissues. At 15 d.p.i., both
sc-inoculated and mosquito-bite challenged animals were eutha-
nized and tissues collected. In mosquito-bitten animals hemo-
lymphatic tissues contained the highest levels of detectable vRNA.
Lymph nodes and spleen were the most highly positive, ranging
from 3.1 × 102 to 1.8 × 105 vRNA copies/mg of tissue at 15 days
PF (Fig. 3). Kidney and liver also were positive; and in the female
animal, 458001, reproductive tract tissues were positive (Fig. 3).
Notably brain, ocular, and male reproductive tract tissues from all
animals contained no detectable vRNA (see Table 2 for a list of all
tissues collected and screened). In sc-inoculated animals, hemo-
lymphatic tissues also contained the highest levels of detectable
vRNA in both animals (one animal was excluded because tissues

 were not collected with sterile instruments). Similar to mosquito
bitten animals, kidney, liver, and female reproductive tract tissues
also contained detectable vRNA; likewise, male reproductive tract
tissues contained no detectable ZIKV RNA. In contrast to mos-
quito bitten animals, ZIKV RNA was detected in the cerebrum of
566628 and the eye of both sc-inoculated animals (Fig. 3).
Mosquito transmission alters ZIKV populations in macaques.
To characterize the genetic diversity of viral populations trans-
mitted by mosquitoes, we used Illumina deep sequencing to
identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in viral popu-
lations present in the viral open reading frame in the ZIKV-
PRVABC59 stock, in plasma from monkeys infected by mosquito
bite, and in saliva of individual mosquitoes (collected by capillary
tubes, n = 8; two samples were excluded because of low vRNA
concentration) that fed on mice infected with the same virus
stock and were verified as transmission competent in our in vitro
assay (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 3). For comparison, we
characterized viral SNPs in the 3 monkeys infected by sc injection
with 1 × 104 PFU of the same virus stock. ZIKV sequences from
these samples were assembled to a ZIKV-PRVABC59 reference
sequence (Genbank KU501215). Across all samples, we detected
42 SNPs occurring in one or more samples at a frequency of ≥5%
throughout the viral coding genome (Fig. 4). Of these, 9 SNPs
occurred in structural genes, 33 in nonstructural genes. Viral
populations in mosquito saliva, and in monkeys infected by these
mosquitoes, showed a heterogeneous pattern of SNPs, with fewer
SNPs shared among samples (Fig. 4a, b). By contrast, in sc-
infected monkeys, the frequency and distribution of viral SNPs
were highly similar among infected animals and closely resembled
those observed in the stock virus (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, the
process of mosquito transmission appeared to alter the fre-
quencies of SNPs observed in the ZIKV-PRVABC59 stock virus:
for example, a mutation at reference nucleotide 3147 causing a
methionine-to-threonine substitution at position 220 of NS1
(NS1 M220T) was at high frequency in multiple mosquito
samples and in all monkeys infected by mosquito bite, but it
remained below 15% frequency in the virus stock and in all
animals infected by sc injection. Conversely, a C-to-T mutation at
nucleotide 5679 encoding NS3 S356F was present in ~65% of
stock viruses and in 40–60% of viruses infecting sc-inoculated
animals, but this same mutation was detected in only one mos-
quito saliva sample and was absent from all animals infected by
mosquito bite. We cannot determine from our data whether these
changes in SNP frequencies are the result of natural selection or
other processes, like genetic drift or founder effects.
Mosquitoes feed on small volumes of blood from infected
hosts, limiting the size of the viral population founding infection
in the vector. Also, during replication in mosquitoes, flaviviruses
undergo population bottlenecks as they traverse physical barriers
like the midgut30, 31. We therefore reasoned that viral genetic
diversity in mosquitoes and monkeys infected by mosquito bite
would be low as compared with the virus stock and populations
in sc-inoculated monkeys. To test this prediction, we measured
within-host viral diversity using the π statistic, which quantifies
the number of pairwise differences between sequences without
regard to a specific reference. We calculated π for each gene
encoding a mature viral protein in each sample (except for
protein 2 K and NS4A, where coverage was not deep enough in
each sample to allow for rigorous comparisons). Consistent with
our expectations, our analysis showed that viral diversity tended
to be lowest in mosquito saliva, and highest in the virus stock and
sc-inoculated animals (Supplementary Fig. 1). Differences in
diversity were most pronounced in the capsid gene, where π was
significantly lower in mosquito saliva samples and mosquito-
infected monkeys than in monkeys inoculated sc, but significant
differences between groups were also found in most other viral
genes (Supplementary Fig. 1). Finally, we asked how natural

to remove deleterious mutations, while πS < πN indicates that
positive or diversifying selection is acting to favor the outgrowth
of new viral variants. We therefore compared the magnitude of
πN and πS in each viral gene across experimental groups. πS was
significantly greater than πN in multiple nonstructural genes in
sc-inoculated monkeys, suggesting that virus populations were

 largely under purifying selection (Supplementary Fig. 2). In
contrast, we find evidence for purifying selection in mosquito-
infected monkeys only in capsid and NS5, and only in NS5 in
mosquito saliva. Taken together, our data show that ZIKV
populations in mosquito-infected monkeys exhibit more inter-
host variability (i.e., different combinations of SNPs) than in sc-
inoculated monkeys, perhaps due to sharp viral population
reductions that occur as virus passes from one vertebrate host,
through physical barriers in the mosquito, and to a new host. We
do not find evidence for strong natural selection acting at the gene
level in mosquitoes or mosquito-infected monkeys in our data,
suggesting that reduced diversity results from random population
bottlenecks rather than selection for particular variants.
Viremic rhesus macaques do not infect mosquitoes. To better
understand ZIKV transmission dynamics, Ae. aegypti vector
competence for ZIKV from macaques was evaluated at days 7, 13,
and 25 d PF from mosquitoes that fed on sc-inoculated animals at
3 d.p.i. and days 13 and 25 from mosquitoes that fed on
mosquito-infected animals at 4 d.p.i. All samples from mosqui-
toes that fed on sc-inoculated animals were negative for ZIKV by
plaque assay at all timepoints (Table 3). A single Ae. aegypti that
fed on animals infected by mosquito bite had a disseminated
ZIKV infection at d 25 PF, but this mosquito was not capable of
transmitting the virus as measured by plaque assay (Table 3).
These data are consistent with field epidemiological reports,
which estimated mosquito infection rates during ZIKV outbreaks
to be 0.061%32 and also are consistent with infection rates during
DENV and chikungunya outbreaks33. It should also be noted that
Ae. aegypti with poor competence but high population density
have been capable of sustaining outbreaks of arboviral diseases
such as yellow fever34.
Discussion
In 1956 in Nigeria, investigators attempted to transmit ZIKV to a
healthy rhesus monkey by exposing it to mosquitoes that had fed
on ZIKV-infected mouse blood. The animal remained healthy,
and no virus was detected in blood, but the animal apparently
developed antibodies to ZIKV (no data were shown). As a result,
it was concluded that ZIKV transmission was achieved27. But
beyond this single manuscript, mosquito-bite delivery of ZIKV
for laboratory studies has not been reported in the literature. Here
we demonstrate, for the first time, to our knowledge, that sys-
temic infection in nonhuman primates can result from mosquito-
bite delivery of ZIKV. This work thus establishes a nonhuman
primate model for vector-borne ZIKV transmission. Using this
model, we observed a significant delay to peak viremia when virus
was delivered by mosquito as compared to sc needle inoculation.
While viral genetic composition and diversity levels in sc-
inoculated monkeys largely mirrored those of the stock virus, we
observed a trend toward decreased genetic diversity in virus
populations infecting mosquitoes and the monkeys infected by
them. Viral passage from mice through mosquitoes to macaques
appeared to alter the frequencies of SNPs in the ZIKV population
as compared with the stock virus. We found no evidence that
selection favored specific variants in mosquito transmission;
instead, we observed a more heterogeneous distribution of viral
SNPs in mosquito-infected monkeys than in sc-inoculated ani-
mals. These findings are consistent with the observation that
arboviruses undergo multiple population bottlenecks in infected
mosquitoes30, 31; as a result, different mosquitoes could transmit
different founder populations to different macaques. Further-
more, because each macaque was bitten by multiple mosquitoes,
viral populations in macaques could represent mixtures of
populations from more than one mosquito. The low number of
viral genome copies isolated from mosquito saliva, together with
the differing patterns of SNPs observed among mosquito-bitten
macaques, are also consistent with the interpretation that trans-
mission between mammalian hosts via mosquitoes involves one
or more random viral population bottlenecks. A recent study of
DENV evolution in mosquitoes found evidence for both random
population bottlenecks and purifying selection as the virus
replicated in mosquitoes and crossed anatomical barriers30. Our
data reveal only limited evidence of purifying selection on ZIKV
populations
sequenced
from
mosquito
saliva
(indeed,
we
observed the strongest signals of purifying selection in viruses
infecting sc-inoculated monkeys), but our study investigated virus
populations at single timepoints in infected macaques and mos-
quitoes and was therefore not powered to carefully evaluate
within-host selection on virus populations over time. There is no
evidence in our data suggesting that differences in the genetic
composition of viruses infecting mosquito-bitten macaques
resulted in phenotypic differences in, e.g., disease severity or
dissemination of virus to different tissues, but if the source virus
population encoded broader phenotypic diversity it is possible
that founder effects associated with mosquito transmission could
result in phenotypically different infections in different hosts.
Mosquitoes were infected by feeding on ZIKV-infected immune-
deficient mice; it is therefore possible that viral variants emerging
during replication in mice could have encoded some of the
phenotypic differences we observed in macaques. However, this
appears unlikely, as no specific SNP or constellation of SNPs was
consistently detected that distinguished viruses replicating in
mosquito-bitten animals from viruses present in sc-inoculated
animals.
It is well established that mosquito transmission can affect
arbovirus infection outcomes, but outcomes vary depending on
the mosquito-virus-host system11, 12, 17, 35. In this study we found
a single sc dose of 1 × 104 PFU of ZIKV led to an altered tissue
distribution as compared to mosquito-inoculated animals at 15 d.
p.i. Although a single sc inoculation may not perfectly model
vector-borne transmission of ZIKV, we anticipate that sc inocu-
lation will continue to be valuable for studying ZIKV pathogen-
esis. Needle inoculation remains an important option when it is
necessary to control the exact dose delivered, but the dose and
number of sc inoculations could alter virus distribution and
replication kinetics. For example, several recent studies using
needle inoculation detected a broad ZIKV RNA tissue distribution,
including in reproductive organs, the CNS, and brain7, 26, 36, 37.
Likewise, we also found evidence of ZIKV infection of the brain
and eye in our needle-inoculated animals. In contrast, animals
challenged by mosquito bite had no evidence of infection of the

 brain or CNS at 15 d.p.i. Furthermore, similar to what has been
described for human infections (i.e., that most cases are asymp-
tomatic), none of the animals studied here displayed any of the
hallmark symptoms (e.g.,
fever, maculopapular rash, con-
junctivitis, etc.) that have been associated with overt Zika fever or
those that have been associated with neurologic disease in adults
in rare instances (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome38, 39, encephalitis,
meningoencephalitis,
and
myelitis40);
therefore,
outcomes
observed here may more closely parallel what has been reported
during adult human infections. Finally, we did not detect ZIKV
RNA in male reproductive tract tissues. This was somewhat
surprising considering reports of both male-to-female and male-
to-male sexual transmission of ZIKV41, both of which are sug-
gestive of the male urogenital tract tissues serving as potential
reservoirs for the virus. It is possible that additional analyses of
more animals at different timepoints using more careful sampling
would more sensitively detect ZIKV RNA.
It is possible that the differences in disease outcomes and virus
distribution observed in our study relative to the other studies
may be due to the use of a specific strain, dose, or host species.
However, many of the published studies used the same Puerto
Rican ZIKV strain used in our study. Asian/American lineage
outbreak strains share >99% genome-wide nucleotide identity42,
but virus stocks prepared at different centers, while nominally the
same strain, have different passage histories, which could result in
small, but biologically important, genotypic and phenotypic dif-
ferences. Another possible explanation for the disparity in out-
comes is the inoculation route. For example, iv inoculation likely
resulted in antigen presentation to many lymph nodes simulta-
neously, likely promoting faster innate immune responses and
faster clearance of virus from the peripheral blood7. Sc inocula-
tion, by contrast, likely resulted in slower dissemination through
the draining lymph nodes; dissemination may be slower still
following mosquito infection, as indicated by the delay in peak
viral loads observed with mosquito-bite delivery of virus in this
study. In addition, the use of multiple simultaneous injections36
could iatrogenically cause disease signs17. For example, the fever
response observed with multiple injections might be expected,
given that injection of virus stocks also delivers cell culture
medium components that might serve as irritants; needle punc-
ture of the skin is also more traumatic than insertion of a mos-
quito proboscis. Accordingly, needle inoculation of DENV
resulted in significantly elevated temperatures in the humanized
mouse model as compared to mice infected with DENV via
mosquito bite17. Notably, our sc-inoculated animals did not have
elevated body temperatures.
It also is possible that the differences in infection kinetics,
tissue distribution, and viral population diversity in mosquito-
bitten animals relevant to sc-inoculated animals may be due to
the fact that feeding and probing mosquitoes deliver variable
inoculum doses. We estimated the infectious ZIKV dose delivered
by a mosquito to be 101.5 to 103.2 PFU per mosquito. In addition,
each animal received multiple mosquito bites. Still, with our
observed transmission frequency at 25% (Table 1) it is likely that
each animal received a cumulative dose lower than 1 × 104 PFU,
i.e., lower than the dose delivered by needle inoculation. However,
as mentioned previously, collection of mosquito saliva via capil-
lary feeding does not allow mosquitoes to probe and feed natu-
rally and therefore likely underestimates the dose of virus
inoculated. In fact, mosquitoes probing and feeding on a living
host delivered doses of other flaviviruses that were 10- to 1000-
fold higher than those measured using in vitro methods12.
Therefore, it also is possible that the mosquito-bitten macaques
received a cumulative dose that was several orders of magnitude
higher than that delivered by sc inoculation, but this requires
further experimental verification. Importantly, the highest plasma
viral loads were observed in the two animals (458001 and 268283)
that received the least number of mosquito bites (five bites each).
At the very least, these data warrant further exploration into the
exact dose of ZIKV delivered by a feeding and probing mosquito.
Surprisingly, in our experiments no Ae. aegypti (with the
exception of a single mosquito that fed on a mosquito-bite
inoculated animal) became infected with ZIKV after feeding on
ZIKV-viremic macaques. This was likely the result of the low
amount of infectious virus in macaque blood. Our previous stu-
dies indicate that the PFU:particle ratio for ZIKV in our system is
~1:1000 and therefore infectious bloodmeal titers for mosquito
feeding experiments were <4.0 log10 PFU/ml (ref. [2]). It is likely
that mosquito vectors do not become efficiently infected when
ZIKV titers are low, and higher viral titers in the bloodmeal
increase the probability of mosquito infection43. The exact
threshold viremia that results in productive mosquito infection
remains unknown, but a recent study used artificial membrane
feeding to establish a minimum infective dose of 4.2 log10 PFU/ml
for susceptibility in mosquitoes43. It should be noted that viral
loads in macaque plasma resemble those reported in humans in
endemic areas32, 44–47. Furthermore, the first clinical description
of a patient suffering from Zika fever was reported in 1956, and
was based on a ZIKV infection experimentally induced in a
human volunteer48. The patient was a 34-year-old European male
infected sc with 265 50% mouse lethal doses of the strain of ZIKV
isolated in Nigeria in 1954. His first symptoms were fever and a
slight headache 3.5 days after inoculation. The headache lasted
approximately two days. A rash was not recorded. The patient
also was exposed to female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes during the
acute stage of illness, and similar to what is described here, ZIKV
was not recovered from these mosquitoes, perhaps due to low
viremia48.
We established a mosquito infection model of ZIKV in non-
human primates to understand the impact of mosquito trans-
mission on ZIKV pathogenesis. Here we used the rhesus macaque
because it is a well-studied translational model for viral patho-
genesis and for preclinical evaluation of countermeasures,
including during pregnancy. However, the approaches we
describe to achieve mosquito transmission of ZIKV in the
laboratory have many other applications. For example, mosquito
transmission models using New-World NHP could help predict
the likelihood of establishing sylvatic ZIKV cycles in the Amer-
icas. Parallel studies should also evaluate vector competence of
New-World mosquito species, particularly those vectors that may

 have the capacity to maintain sylvatic cycles (e.g., Sabethes spp.
and Haemogogus spp.) and those that may be capable of bridging
sylvatic and urban cycles (e.g., Aedes albopictus)49. These mos-
quito species may have a lower threshold to infection as com-
pared to Ae. aegypti, but this will require further laboratory
confirmation.
Needle inoculation of arboviruses does not faithfully recapi-
tulate the complex factors involved in vector-borne transmission,
which can have important impacts on disease pathogenesis. In
our study 4/4 animals were infected in a single feeding session,
suggesting that mosquito delivery of ZIKV in nonhuman pri-
mates provides a tractable animal model of natural transmission
that can be applied to many other mosquito-borne pathogens. For
example, studies comparing the course of infection and the
immune response between DENVs delivered by mosquito vs.
needle could be important for defining the quality of the immune
response to dengue where both the mosquito vector and enhan-
cing antibodies should be considered18. Ultimately, these same
approaches may be useful for testing the safety and efficacy of
vaccine and therapeutic candidates: previous reports have
demonstrated that Leishmania vaccines that protected against
needle challenge failed against sandfly bite challenge50, 51 and a
blood-stage malaria vaccine was shown to be ineffective against
mosquito-bite
challenge
in
humans52.
Whether
mosquito-
vectored ZIKV challenge might alter the efficacy of vaccines
relative to needle inoculation remains unknown, but these results
from other systems underscore the importance of studying
pathogenic outcomes following natural exposure to a pathogen.
Eventually the approaches we describe could even be extended
beyond mosquitoes to pathogens whose vectors share similar
blood feeding strategies, such as tick-borne viruses.
Methods
Study design. This study was designed as a proof of concept study to examine
whether sc inoculation of ZIKV fundamentally differs from mosquito bite delivery
of ZIKV in the rhesus macaque model. Available animals were allocated into
experimental groups randomly with both groups containing male and female
animals. Investigators were not blinded to experimental groups.
Ethical approval. This study was approved by the University of Wisconsin-
Madison Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Animal Care and Use
Protocol Number G005401 and V5519).
Nonhuman primates. Five males and two females, Indian-origin rhesus macaques
utilized in this study were cared for by the staff at the Wisconsin National Primate
Research Center (WNPRC) in accordance with the regulations, guidelines, and
recommendations outlined in the Animal Welfare Act, the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Weatherall report. In addition, all macaques
utilized in the study were free of Macacine herpesvirus 1, Simian Retrovirus Type
D, Simian T-lymphotropic virus Type 1, and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus. For
all procedures, animals were anesthetized with an intramuscular dose of ketamine
(10 ml/kg). Blood samples were obtained using a vacutainer or needle and syringe
from the femoral or saphenous vein.
Cells and viruses. African Green Monkey kidney cells (Vero; ATCC #CCL-81)
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 g/l
sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml of streptomycin, and incubated
at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Aedes albopictus mosquito cells were (C6/36; ATCC #CRL-
1660) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/
ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml of streptomycin, and incubated at 28 °C in 5% CO2. ZIKV
strain PRVABC59 (ZIKV-PR; GenBank:KU501215), originally isolated from a
traveler to Puerto Rico with three rounds of amplification on Vero cells, was
obtained from Brandy Russell (CDC, Ft. Collins, CO). Virus stocks were prepared
by inoculation onto a confluent monolayer of C6/36 mosquito cells with two
rounds of amplification. A single harvest with a titer of 1.58 × 107 plaque-forming
units (PFU) per ml (equivalent to 2.01 × 1010 vRNA copies per ml) of Zika virus/H.
sapiens-tc/PUR/2015/PRVABC59-v3c2 were used for challenges. We deep
sequenced the challenge stock to verify the expected origin (see details in a section
below). The ZIKV challenge stock sequence matched the GenBank sequence
(KU501215) of the parental virus, but there were five sites where between 5 and
92% of sequences contained variants that appear to be authentic (four out of five
were non-synonymous changes; Supplementary Table 2).
Mosquito strains and colony maintenance. The Aedes aegypti black-eyed
Liverpool (LVP) strain used in this study was obtained from Lyric Bartholomay
(University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI) and maintained at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin-Madison as previously described53. Ae. aegypti LVP are ZIKV
transmission competent28.
Subcutaneous inoculations. The ZIKV-PR stock was thawed, diluted in PBS to
1 × 104 PFU/ml, and loaded into a 3 ml syringe maintained on ice until inoculation.
For sc inoculations, each of three Indian-origin rhesus macaques was anesthetized
and inoculated sc over the cranial dorsum with 1 ml virus stock containing 1 × 104
PFU. All animals were closely monitored by veterinary and animal care staff for
adverse reactions and signs of disease. Animals were examined, and blood, urine,
oral swabs, and saliva were collected from each animal daily from 1 through
10 days, and 14 d.p.i., and beginning on the fifteenth day animals were humanely
killed and necropsied.
Mosquito bite challenges. Mosquitoes were exposed to ZIKV by feeding on
isoflurane anesthetized ZIKV-infected Ifnar−/− mice, which develop sufficiently
high ZIKV viremia to infect mosquitoes28, 29. Ifnar−/− on the C57BL/6 back-
ground were bred in the pathogen-free animal facilities of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine. Two male and two female
four-week-old mice were used for mosquito exposures. Mice were inoculated in the
left, hind foot pad with 1 × 106 PFU of ZIKV in 50 µl of sterile PBS. Three- to six-
day-old female mosquitoes were allowed to feed on mice two days post infection at
which time sub-mandibular blood draws were performed and serum was collected
to verify viremia. These mice yielded an infectious bloodmeal concentration of 5.64
log10 PFU per ml ± 0.152 (mean ± s.d.). Mosquitoes that fed to repletion were
randomized, separated into cartons in groups of 10–50, and maintained on 0.3 M
sucrose in an environmental chamber at 26.5 °C ± 1 °C, 75% ± 5% relative
humidity, and with a 12 h photoperiod within the Department of Pathobiological
Sciences BSL3 Insectary Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Eleven
days later, following oviposition, ZIKV-exposed mosquitoes were sucrose starved
for 14 to 16 h and on the twelfth day mosquitoes were exposed to naive, ketamine
anesthetized macaques. The mesh top of a 0.6 liter carton containing 10–50 ZIKV-
exposed mosquitoes (numbers varied to ensure feeding success) was placed in
contact with the left forearm of each of four macaques. The forearm was chosen
because there was little hair to obstruct mosquito feeding, it could easily be placed
on top of the mosquito carton, and mosquitoes could be easily monitored during
the feeding. Mosquitoes were allowed to probe and feed on the forearm for five
minutes. Mosquitoes were monitored during feedings and the number of mos-
quitoes that probed and the blood engorgement status of each mosquito were
recorded. ZIKV infection, dissemination, and transmission status was confirmed in
a subset of 40 mosquitoes as described in a subsequent section. As described
previously, animals were examined, and blood, urine, and oral swabs were collected
from each animal daily during challenge. None of the mosquito-bite challenged
animals exhibited cutaneous reactions to mosquito bites and bites were not asso-
ciated with itching.
Vector competence. Infection, dissemination, and transmission rates were
determined for individual mosquitoes and sample sizes were chosen using long
established procedures28, 29, 44. Mosquitoes that fed to repletion on macaques were
randomized and separated into cartons in groups of 40–50 and maintained as
described in a previous section. Mosquitoes were exposed to the sc-inoculated
animals at 3 d.p.i. and the mosquito-bitten animals at 4 d.p.i. All samples were
screened by plaque assay on Vero cells. Dissemination was indicated by virus-
positive legs. Transmission was defined as release of infectious virus with salivary
secretions, i.e., the potential to infect another host, and was indicated by virus-
positive salivary secretions.
Plaque assay. All ZIKV screens from mosquito tissues and titrations for virus
quantification from mouse serum or virus stocks were completed by plaque assay
on Vero cell cultures. Duplicate wells were infected with 0.1 ml aliquots from serial
10-fold dilutions in growth media and virus was adsorbed for one hour. Following
incubation, the inoculum was removed, and monolayers were overlaid with 3 ml
containing a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% oxoid agar and 2X DMEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA)
with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 2% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were
incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for four days for plaque development. Cell mono-
layers then were stained with 3 ml of overlay containing a 1:1 mixture of 1.2%
oxoid agar and 2× DMEM with 2% (vol/vol) FBS, 2% (vol/vol) penicillin/strep-
tomycin, and 0.33% neutral red (Gibco). Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C
and plaques were counted.
Viral RNA isolation. Plasma was isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood
collected the same day by Ficoll density centrifugation at 1860 rcf for 30 minutes.
Plasma was removed to a clean 15 ml conical tube and centrifuged at 670 rcf for an
additional 8 minutes to remove residual cells. Viral RNA was extracted from 300 μl

 plasma using the Viral Total Nucleic Acid Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) on a
Maxwell 16 MDx instrument (Promega). Tissues were processed with RNAlater
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Viral RNA
was isolated from the tissues using the Maxwell 16 LEV simplyRNA Tissue Kit
(Promega) on a Maxwell 16 MDx instrument. A range of 20–40 mg of each tissue
was homogenized using homogenization buffer from the Maxwell 16 LEV sim-
plyRNA Tissue Kit, the TissueLyser (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and two 5 mm
stainless steel beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a 2 ml snap-cap tube, shaking
twice for 3 min at 20 Hz each side. The isolation was continued according to the
Maxwell 16 LEV simplyRNA Tissue Kit protocol, and samples were eluted into 50
µl RNase-free water. RNA was then quantified using qRT–PCR. If a tissue was
negative by this method, a duplicate tissue sample was extracted using the Trizol
Plus RNA Purification kit (Invitrogen). Because this purification kit allows for
more than twice the weight of tissue starting material, there is an increased like-
lihood of detecting vRNA in tissues with low viral loads. RNA then was re-
quantified using the same quantitative RT–PCR assay. Viral load data from plasma
are expressed as vRNA copies/ml. Viral load data from tissues are expressed as
vRNA copies/mg tissue.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR. For ZIKV-PR, vRNA from plasma and
tissues was quantified by qRT–PCR using primers with a slight modification to
those described by Lanciotti et al. to accommodate African lineage ZIKV
sequences54. The modified primer sequences are: forward 5′-CGYTGCCCAACA-
CAAGG-3′, reverse 5′-CACYAAYGTTCTTTTGCABACAT-3′, and probe 5′-
6fam-AGCCTACCTTGAYAAGCARTCAGACACYCAA-BHQ1-3′. The RT–PCR
was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT–PCR
system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The primers and probe were used at final con-
centrations of 600 nm and 100 nm respectively, along with 150 ng random primers
(Promega, Madison, WI). Cycling conditions were as follows: 37 °C for 15 min, 50 °
C for 30 min and 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C
for 1 min. Viral RNA concentration was determined by interpolation onto an
internal standard curve composed of seven 10-fold serial dilutions of a synthetic
ZIKV RNA fragment based on a ZIKV strain derived from French Polynesia that
shares > 99% similarity at the nucleotide level to the Puerto Rican strain used in the
infections described in this manuscript.
Macaque necropsy. Following infection with ZIKV-PR via sc inoculation or
mosquito-bite, macaques were sacrificed at ~15 days post-feeding or post needle
inoculation for all animals. Tissues were carefully dissected using sterile instru-
ments that were changed between each organ and tissue type to minimize possible
cross contamination. Unfortunately, tissues from one sc-inoculated animal
(634675) were not collected with sterile instruments and was therefore excluded
from tissue analysis. For each of the two remaining animals infected by sc
inoculation (566628 and 311413) and all four animals infected by mosquito bite,
each organ/tissue was evaluated grossly in situ, removed with sterile instruments,
placed in a sterile culture dish, weighed, and further processed to assess viral
burden and tissue distribution or banked for future assays. Sampling of key organ
systems suspected as potential tissue reservoirs for ZIKV and associated biological
samples included the CNS (brain and eyes), urogenital, hematopoietic, and
respiratory systems. A comprehensive listing of all specific tissues collected and
analyzed is presented in Table 1.
Deep sequencing. Virus populations replicating in macaque plasma or mosquito
saliva were sequenced in duplicate using a method adapted from Quick et al.55.
Viral RNA was isolated from mosquito saliva or plasma using the Maxwell 16 Total
Viral Nucleic Acid Purification kit, according to manufacturer’s protocol. Viral
RNA then was subjected to RT–PCR using the SuperScript IV Reverse Tran-
scriptase enzyme (Invitrogen). Input viral RNA ranged from 294 to 64745 viral
RNA templates per cDNA reaction (Supplementary Table 3). The cDNA was then
split into two multiplex PCR reactions using the PCR primers described in Quick
et. al with the Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase enzyme (New England Biolabs,
Inc., Ipswich, MA). PCR products were tagged with the Illumina TruSeq Nano HT
kit and sequenced with a 2 × 300 kit on an Illumina MiSeq.
Sequence analysis. Amplicon data were analyzed using a workflow we term
“Zequencer 2017” (https://bitbucket.org/dhoconno/zequencer/src). Briefly, R1 and
R2 fastq files from the paired-read Illumina miSeq dataset were merged, trimmed,
and normalized using the bbtools package (http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/
bbtools) and Seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Bbmerge.sh was used to merge
reads, and to trim primer sequences by setting the forcetrimleft parameter 22. All
other parameters are set to default values. These reads were then mapped to the
reference amplicon sequences with BBmap.sh. Reads substantially shorter than the
amplicon were filtered out by reformat.sh (the minlength parameter was set to the
length of the amplicon minus 60). Seqtk was used to subsample to 1000 reads per
amplicon. Quality trimming was performed on the fastq file of normalized reads by
bbmap’s reformat.sh (qtrim parameter set to ‘lr’, all other parameters set to
default). Novoalign (http://www.novocraft.com/products/novoalign/) was used to
map each read to ZIKV-PRVABC59 reference sequence KU501215. Novoalign’s
soft clipping feature was turned off by specifying the parameter “-o FullNW”.
Approximate fragment length was set to 300 bp, with a s.d. of 50. We used Sam-
tools to map, sort, and create an mpileup of our reads (http://samtools.sourceforge.
net/). Samtools’ base alignment quality (BAQ) computation was turned off;
otherwise, default settings were used. SNP calling was performed with VarScan’s
mpileupcns function (http://varscan.sourceforge.net/). The minimum average
quality was set to 30; otherwise, default settings were used. VCF files were anno-
tated using SnpEff56. Accurate calling of end-of-read SNPs are a known weakness
of current alignment algorithms57; in particular, Samtools’ BAQ computation
feature is known to be a source of error when using VarScan (http://varscan.
sourceforge.net/germline-calling.html). Therefore, both Novoalign’s soft clipping
feature and Samtools’ BAQ were turned off to increase the accuracy of SNP calling
for SNPs occurring at the end of a read.
Evolutionary analysis. The π statistic, which estimates pairwise nucleotide
diversity over a specified sequence length (in this case, individual ZIKV genes)
without regard to a reference, was calculated using the Variance-at-position script
in the open-source PoPoolation 1.2.258. Synonymous and non-synonymous
nucleotide diversity (πN and πS) were calculated using the PoPoolation script syn-
nonsyn-at-position. For all calculations, minimum coverage was set to 100 and
corrections were disabled.
ZIKV NS1-specific ELISA. IgM ZIKV-specific antibody responses were assessed
using the Euroimmun diagnostic kit assay. Briefly, a 1:100 dilution of macaque
serum was performed in duplicate and added to the precoated plates. The assay was
performed following the manufacturer’s instructions, with photometric measure-
ments taken at 450 nm.
Statistical analyses. The difference in time to peak viremia between animals
sc-inoculated and animals infected by mosquito bite was assessed with a linear
mixed-effects model using the nlme package in R v3.3.259 with time to peak vir-
emia as the response variable, route of infection as the explanatory variable, and
animal ID as the random effect. The difference in peak viral loads between the two
groups was analyzed with GraphPad Prism software and an unpaired Student’s t-
test was used to determine significant differences in viral loads. Differences in
overall nucleotide diversity (π) among study groups was analyzed in GraphPad
Prism using one-way analysis of variance with correction for multiple comparisons.
Differences in synonymous and non-synonymous diversity (πN and πS) within
groups were analyzed using Student’s paired t-test in GraphPad Prism.
