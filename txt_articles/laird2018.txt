Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Campylobacter jejuni (CJ), and Shigella sp. are major causes of
bacterial diarrhea worldwide, but there are no licensed vaccines against any of these pathogens. Most
current approaches to ETEC vaccines are based on recombinant proteins that are involved in virulence,
particularly adhesins. In contrast, approaches to Shigella and CJ vaccines have included conjugate vaccines
in which Shigella lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or CJ capsule polysaccharides are chemically conjugated to
proteins. We have explored the feasibility of developing a multi-pathogen vaccine by using ETEC proteins
as conjugating partners for CJ and Shigella polysaccharides. We synthesized three vaccines in which two
CJ polysaccharides were conjugated to two recombinant ETEC adhesins based on CFA/I (CfaEB) and CS6
(CssBA), and LPS from Shigella flexneri was also conjugated to CfaEB. The vaccines were immunogenic
in mice as monovalent, bivalent and trivalent formulations. Importantly, functional antibodies capable
of inducing hemaglutination inhibition (HAI) of a CFA/I expressing ETEC strain were induced in all
vaccines containing CfaEB. These data suggest that conjugate vaccines could be a platform for a multi-
pathogen, multi-serotype vaccine against the three major causes of diarrheal disease worldwide.

1. Introduction
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) Campylobacter jejuni (CJ),
and Shigella sp. are major causes of bacterial diarrhea worldwide.
Global deaths due to diarrhea have decreased in the last decade,
partially due to the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine [1], and
the most recent estimates indicate that there 54,900 deaths due
to Shigella, 23,600 due to ETEC and 30,900 due to Campylobacter
in children under five years of age in low to middle income coun-
tries [1]. Nonetheless, there is also an increased awareness of
chronic consequences of these infections [2–5] indicating that
these three enteric pathogens remain serious health threats to
western travelers and young children in resource-limited countries
making them apt target populations for vaccines.
ETEC causes diarrhea that can range in severity from mild
illness to cholera-like purging. Several well-recognized virulence
factors, including colonization factors, EtpA, and the heat-labile
and heat-stable enterotoxins have been investigated extensively
as vaccine candidates [6,7]. One of the major colonization factors
is colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) which is composed of a
major pilin subunit, CfaB, and a tip adhesin, CfaE, that mediates
binding to intestinal cells. Hyperimmune bovine colostral antibod-
ies
raised
against
CFA/I
and
recombinantly
expressed
CfaE
protected human subjects from diarrhea after challenge with
CFA/I-expressing ETEC strain H10407 [8,9]. We designed a fusion
protein stabilized by donor strand complementation (dsc), termed
dscCfaEB, but hereafter called CfaEB, containing both CfaE and
CfaB, as a vaccine candidate designed to increase efficacy and
broaden coverage against ETEC expressing CFA/I and related
fimbrial structures [10–12]. Additionally, using a similar rationale,
we developed a stable and immunogenic CS6-derived donor strand
complemented fusion protein, dscCssBA, or hereafter called CssBA,

 which combines the two subunits that form the CS6 surface anti-
gen, CssA and CssB [13].
The symptoms of campylobacter enteritis generally include
diarrhea, often with leukocytes and blood. The disease is zoonotic,
with most sporadic cases associated with contaminated poultry,
but major outbreaks have also been associated with water [14]
or raw milk contamination [15]. Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS),
a post-infectious polyneuropathy that can result in paralysis, is a
complication of CJ infection [16]. The association is due to molec-
ular mimicry between the sialic acid containing-outer core of the
lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and human gangliosides [17]. The patho-
genesis of CJ remains poorly understood in comparison with other
pathogens, but the organism expresses a polysaccharide capsule
(CPS) that contributes to virulence [18–22]. The successes of
polysaccharide conjugate vaccines against other mucosal patho-
gens led us to evaluate this approach for CJ. A prototype conjugate
vaccine composed of the CPS of CJ strain 81-176 conjugated to
CRM197, a carrier protein used in licensed conjugate vaccines,
provided 100% efficacy against diarrheal disease in non-human pri-
mates [23]. The CPS is the major serodeterminant of the heat stable
(HS) serotyping scheme of C. jejuni, a scheme that has 47 ser-
ogroups [24]. Thus, a final conjugate vaccine would be multivalent,
composed of CPSs from the predominant serotypes.
There are four major species of Shigella and 59 different sero-
types based on lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but most disease world-
wide is caused by Shigella sonnei and three serotypes of Shigella
flexneri [25,26]. Seroepidemiology studies indicate that antibodies
generated against the O-polysaccharide (O-PS) of LPS correlate
with protection against the same serotype [27]. There are numer-
ous approaches toward development of Shigella vaccines, including
several variations on live attenuated vaccines [28–31]. There are
also multiple approaches to vaccines based on the repeating units
of the O-PS, including classic conjugate vaccines using detoxified
LPS [32], conjugates utilizing synthetic O-PS [33,34], biological
glycoconjugates [35] and mixtures of LPS and Shigella invasion pro-
teins [36].
Since subunit vaccine approaches to both CJ and Shigella involve
multiple polysaccharide antigens and all subunit approaches to
ETEC involve multiple protein antigens, we have explored the
possibility conjugating CJ and Shigella polysaccharides to ETEC pro-
teins. Although a limited number of carriers are found in licensed
conjugate vaccines, there are many reports using alternate proteins
in an effort to expand the effectiveness of conjugate vaccines
[37–40]. The standard CRM197 carrier presents a monomeric
species with 7% of its amino acids (39/535) comprising surface-
exposed lysines that are available for amino-linked conjugation to
activated polysaccharides. Examination of the solved atomic struc-
ture of CfaEB shows that this protein is also rich in surface-
exposed lysines, constituting 6% of all residues (31/516) [41]. CfaEB
and CssBA have bioadhesive properties, are non-toxic and behave as
homogeneous monomeric species in solution, making them favor-
able candidates for use as carrier proteins [11,42,43]. Here, we
report on studies evaluating immunogenicity in mice of prototype
conjugate vaccines composed of: (i) two CPSs from CJ conjugated
to two recombinant ETEC proteins: CfaEB, representing a CFA/I ETEC
vaccine candidate, and CssBA, representing a CS6 ETEC vaccine
candidate; and (ii) a conjugate of detoxified Shigella O-PS to CfaEB.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bacterial strains and growth for polysaccharide purification
The following bacterial strains were used for polysaccharide
purification: (1) CJ strain PG3208 expressing HS23/36 CPS type
[44]; (2) CJ strain BH-01-0142 expressing HS3 CPS type [45]; and
(3) S. flexneri 2a strain 2457O [46]. Both CJ strains used lack the
ganglioside mimicry in LOS cores that is associated with GBS.
Strain PG3208 is a mutant of strain 81-176 (CPS type HS23/36)
in which the galT gene was insertionally inactivated with a chlo-
ramphenicol cassette resulting in a truncated core [44], while the
LOS core of strain BH-01-0142 (CPS type HS3) naturally lacks gan-
glioside mimicry [45]. CJ strains were grown in porcine Brain Heart
Broth for CPS extraction at 37 �C under microaerobic conditions. S.
flexneri was grown in L-broth at 37 �C.
2.2. Purification of recombinant ETEC proteins
The recombinant proteins CfaEB and CfaE (used for ELISA anal-
yses, see below) were produced as previously described [10]. The
CssBA clone was constructed from the CS6 producing ETEC strain
B7A [13] and the full details of the construction and characteriza-
tion will be presented elsewhere. All purified proteins were >95%
pure based on densitometry analysis on SDS-PAGE, and the
endotoxin level of each protein was <20 endotoxin units (EUs)/
mg protein by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (LAL: Lonza). Each
protein was monomeric in solution based on size exclusion HPLC
and reacted positively to anti-sera raised against its components
and 6xHis tag on the western blots.
2.3. Cloning of CS6
The CS6 operon was amplified from ETEC strain B7A by PCR
with
primers
pENTR-CS6
F
50-CACCATGAAGAAAACAATTGGTT
TAATTC-30
and
pENTR-CS6
R
50-CAGGAAGTTTAGTCTCCA

[47].
The
resulting
fragment
was
cloned
into
pENTRTM/SD/D-TOPO� vector using Invitrogen’s pENTRTM/SD/D-
TOPO� Cloning Kit. Next, the CS6 operon was moved from the
pENTRTM/SD/D-TOPO�
vector
into
the
Gateway�
destination
expression vector pDESTTM14 (Invitrogen) using Gateway� LR Clo-
nase Mix (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was expressed in
the arabinose-inducible E. coli host strain BL21-AITM (Invitrogen).
2.4. Purification of CS6 fimbriae
CS6
fimbriae
were
purified
from
the
recombinant
clone
described above by a modification of the method of Ghosal et al.
[48]. Briefly, a 10 L culture of recombinant BL21AI/pDEST14-CS6-
B7A expression strain was grown in a bioreactor (BioFlow 3000,
Eppendorf) containing Select APSTM Super Broth (BD Difco), 4 mL/
L glucose, and ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL). The culture was grown at
37 �C with 850 rpm agitation to an optical density (600 nm) of 5
and induced for 3 h with 0.2% arabinose. Cells were harvested
and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4 (PBS).
CS6 was extracted and partially purified from the cells using
heat-saline extraction and ammonium sulfate precipitation. The
resulting ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris
pH 8.0 and dialyzed overnight in the same buffer. The suspension
was then applied to a 5 mL HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with 20 mM Tris at pH 8.0. The recombinant CS6 pro-
tein was then eluted with a 50–500 mM sodium chloride gradient
over 30 column volumes using an AKTA Pure chromatography sys-
tem (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing the protein were pooled
and concentrated. Protein concentration was determined by a
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce).
2.5. Polysaccharide extraction and conjugation
Polysaccharide extraction and purification were carried out
with hot phenol as previously described [23]. The Shigella LPS
was de-lipidated by treatment with 1% acetic acid at 100 �C for
1.5 h. Mild centrifugation of the hydrolysate afforded the LPS free

 of lipid A in the supernatant and the insoluble lipid A as a pellet.
The O-PS devoid of lipid A was dialyzed and further purified
through a Bio-Gel P-2 column (1 cm � 1 m) with water as eluent.
All polysaccharides had endotoxin levels <100 EUs/lg polysaccha-
ride by LAL. The conjugation of HS23/36 CPS, with the structure

GlcpNAc-(1 ? 3)-a-D-Galp-(1?]n
and
non-stoichiometric
O-
methyl phosphoramidate residues at positions 2,4 and 6 of Gal,
to CfaEB was achieved as done before with CRM197 [23], in which
the non-reducing galactose unit of the CPS was selectively acti-
vated by periodate oxidation for conjugation to CfaEB by reductive
amination. That of HS3 CPS, with a backbone structure composed
of 4-substituted Gal and 3-substituted L-glycero-a-D-ido-Hepp or
its derivative 6-deoxy-a-D-ido-Hepp: [?3)-L-glycero/6-deoxy-a-D-
ido-Hepp-(1 ? 4)-a-D-Galp-(1?]n
and
with
non-stoichiometric
amounts of O-methyl-phosphoramidate at position 2 of the hep-
toses and 3-hydroxypropanoyl at position 3 of galactose, to CssBA
was performed by first selectively activating the primary hydroxyl
at C-7 of the CPS 6-deoxy-ido-heptose to a carboxylic acid by
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation,
followed by conjugation of the activated CPS to CssBA by carbodi-
imide chemistry, as described previously [49]. The scheme for the
conjugation of S. flexneri 2a de-lipidated LPS, with the O-PS struc-
ture [?2)-a-L-Rha-(1 ? 2)-a-L-Rha-(1 ? 3)-{a-D-Glc-(1 ? 4)}a-L-
Rha-(1 ? 3)-b-D-GlcNAc-(1?]n, to CfaEB was carried out by stoi-
chiometrically transforming approximately 10% of the branch glu-
coses to glucuronic acids by TEMPO-mediated oxidation, and then
conjugation of the activated S. flexneri de-lipidated O-PS to CfaEB
via carbodiimide chemistry [49]. Conjugations were performed
using a ratio of 2(CPS):1(protein) by weight. For the CPS-specific
ELISA experiments, BSA conjugates of HS3 and S. flexneri de-
lipidated O-PS were used, and these were produced by the same
methods as just described above for CfaEB and CssBA conjugates.
2.6. Determination of polysaccharide and protein concentrations in
conjugate vaccines
Polysaccharide concentration was determined by anthrone
assay [50] and protein concentrations were determined using the
BCA assay.
2.7. Mouse immunizations
All BALB/cByJ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories
(Bar Harbor, ME), and experiments were approved under the Naval
Medical Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee. In the pilot experiment mice were immunized with either
with a HS23/36-CfaEB conjugate vaccine co-administered with
200 lg of Alhydrogel (alum; Brenntag Biosector) by subcutaneous
(S.C.) injection into the scruff of the neck. Mice were given two
immunizations at 4-week intervals. There were 4 animals in the
low dose group and 5 animals in the high dose group. In subse-
quent
experiments,
BALB/cByJ
mice
were
immunized
with
HS23/36-CfaEB, HS3-CssBA, or Sf-O-PS-CfaEB either as monova-
lent, bivalent or trivalent formulations with doses that were down
selected from individual immunogenicity experiments (data not
shown). The amount of polysaccharide and protein contained in
each formulation is detailed in Table 1. Animals were immunized
S.C. three times, at 4-week intervals, without the use of an adju-
vant. Sera were collected from mice prior to immunization and
every 2-weeks post-immunization.
2.8. Polysaccharide-specific ELISAs
IgG responses to the HS23/36 capsule were determined by
ELISA as previously described using oxidized CPS bound to
Carbo-BIND plates (Corning, Corning NY) [20]. Anti-HS3 or anti-
Sf-O-PS specific antibody responses were measured by coating
HS3-BSA or Sf-O-PS-BSA conjugates, respectively, onto 96-well
plates (Nunc Maxisorp, ThermoScientific). Sera were serially
diluted, and antigen-specific antibodies were detected using a goat
anti-mouse
IgG
peroxidase
conjugated
antibody
(SeraCare,
Gaithersburg, MD) and visualized using ABTS substrate. The optical
density (OD) of individual wells at 405 nm was determined using a
SpectraMax Plus 384 plate reader (Molecular Devices). The mean
OD405 of negative control wells + 3 standard deviations was used
to determine the endpoint titer. Individual animal titers were mea-
sured. Serum pools were created and analyzed for vaccine groups
that did not contain the polysaccharide being measured and were
not analyzed for statistical significance compared to groups that
contained the antigen being analyzed. Endpoint titers were log10
transformed and analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad). Dif-
ferences between experimental groups were considered significant
at p � 0.05 (t test or one-way ANOVA with multiplicity adjusted P
values).
2.9. Measurement of ETEC-specific antibodies by ELISA
Sera were screened for anti-CfaE and anti-CS6 IgG antibodies by
ELISA. Briefly, 96-well plates (NUNC Microwell) were coated with
recombinant CfaE or purified CS6 fimbriae and blocked. Sera were
serially diluted, and antigen-specific antibodies were detected
using a goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugated antibody and
visualized using ABTS substrate. The OD405 of individual wells
was measured and endpoint titers and statistics were calculated
as described above for anti-polysaccharide responses.
2.10. Measurement of anti-adhesive antibodies
A hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) was used to measure
levels of functional anti-adhesive antibodies in mouse serum sam-
ples. Serum samples were tested individually for each animal
immunized with a CfaEB containing conjugate, but in pools in
vaccine groups where no CfaEB was delivered. The samples were
initially diluted 1:8, then diluted two-fold. Each serum dilution
was incubated with an equal volume of CFA/I+ ETEC bacteria (strain

 H10407), further diluting the sera 1:2. The most concentrated dilu-
tion tested was 1:16 (lower limit of quantitation). The pre-
incubated antibody-bacteria mixture was subsequently mixed
with bovine erythrocytes in the presence of 0.5% mannose in U-
bottom 96-wells plates (BD Falcon). In the absence of anti-
adhesive antibodies, the erythrocytes formed visible agglutinated
buttons of cells. In the presence of anti-adhesive antibodies, agglu-
tination was inhibited. The HAI titer was defined as the highest
serial dilution that completely inhibited agglutination. If there
was no detectable inhibition at the lowest serum dilution of
1:16, the samples were assigned a value of one-half of the quanti-
tation limit (i.e. 8) for computational purposes. Endpoint titers
were log2 transformed and analyzed using Prism software. Differ-
ences between experimental groups were considered significant
at p � 0.05 (t test or one-way ANOVA with multiplicity adjusted
P values).
3. Results
3.1. Evaluation of a pilot HS23/36 CPS-CfaEB conjugate vaccine in mice
Two concerns about the approach of combined conjugate vacci-
nes were if sufficient ETEC protein could be delivered in a conju-
gate and if chemical treatment of ETEC proteins, particularly
adhesins, would affect their structure such that they could no
longer elicit functional antibody responses. We administered two
different doses of a pilot HS23/36-CfaEB vaccine, given by total
weight at 10 lg and 60 lg per dose. Since the mass ratio of
polysaccharide to protein in this vaccine was 1.8:1, these doses
corresponded to 6.4 lg PS + 3.6 lg protein (‘‘low”) and 38.4 lg PS
and 21.6 lg protein (‘‘high”), respectively. The vaccine was given
twice at 4-week intervals with alum adjuvant. High levels of
anti-HS23/36 CPS IgG and anti-CfaE IgG were detected after two
doses (Fig. 1A). Anti-HS23/36 IgG titers were slightly lower in the
high dose group, although the difference was not significant. There
was also no significant difference in anti-CfaE IgG titers between
the low and high dose.
We also measured functional anti-adhesive antibodies in a red
blood cell hemagglutination assay as a proxy for neutralization of
ETEC intestinal adhesion via CFA/I fimbriae using the CFA/I
expressing H10407 ETEC strain. High levels of HAI titers were
observed after two immunizations with the HS23/36-CfaEB vac-
cine, and there was no difference in HAI titers between the low
and high dose groups (Fig. 1B). These experiments demonstrated
that ETEC proteins could be utilized as carrier proteins for CJ cap-
sules, while still eliciting anti-ETEC functional antibodies.
3.2. Immunogenicity of other combined conjugate vaccines
We generated a new batch of HS23/36-CfaEB vaccine and two
additional conjugates: an HS3 CJ CPS conjugated to the recombi-
nant ETEC CS6 protein (HS3-CssBA) and S. flexneri 2a O-PS conju-
gated to CfaEB (Sf-O-PS-CfaEB). The PS:protein mass ratios of
these vaccines were: HS23/36-CfaEB (2.6:1); HS3-CssBA (1.8:1);
and
Sf-O-PS-CfaEB
(1:2).
Preliminary
dose-escalation
studies
revealed that the monovalent formulations of all three vaccines
were immunogenic without the addition of alum (data not shown)
and subsequent studies were performed without an adjuvant.
The optimal dose of each conjugate determined by these initial
studies was then used to immunize mice as three monovalent vac-
cines or admixed into three bivalent formulations or a single triva-
lent formulation, as shown in Table 1. Animals were given three
doses subcutaneously at 4-week intervals and bled prior to immu-
nization and two weeks after each immunization. The final IgG
titers to the three polysaccharides are shown in Fig. 2 and final
IgG titers to CfaE and CS6 are shown in Fig. 3A and C, respectively.
HAI titers to CFA/I+ H10407 ETEC are shown in Fig. 3B. As expected,
the monovalent immunized animals generated IgG antibody
responses only to the components of the vaccine with which they
were immunized. Mice immunized with HS23/36-CfaEB vaccine
generated anti-HS23/36 and anti-CfaE IgG antibody responses
(red bars in Figs. 2A and 3A), although the titers were lower than
those observed in the pilot experiment which utilized alum adju-
vant (Fig. 1A). HS3-CssBA immunized animals generated anti-HS3
CPS IgG and anti-CS6 IgG antibodies (blue bars in Figs. 2B and
3C), and Sf-O-PS-CfaEB immunized animals generated anti-Sf-O-
PS IgG and anti-CfaE IgG responses (grey bars in Figs. 2C and 3A).
A 7-fold higher dose of CfaEB was delivered in the Sf-O-PS-CfaEB
vaccine compared to the HS23/36-CfaEB immunized animals (9.5
vs 1.3 mg, respectively; Table 1), generating significantly higher
anti-CfaE IgG titers between these two groups (Fig. 3A, red and
grey bars). However, no significant difference in HAI titers were
observed (Fig. 3B).
Formulation into bivalent or trivalent vaccines did not dramat-
ically affect polysaccharide-specific antibody generation. High
levels of anti-HS23/36 IgG titers were observed in the two bivalent
formulations containing HS23/36-CfaEB (Fig. 2A, purple and
orange bars) and the trivalent formulation (Fig. 2A, black bar) com-
pared to the monovalent vaccine (Fig. 2A, red bar). Similarly, high
levels of anti-HS3 IgG were detected in the bivalent formulation
HS3-CssBA + Sf-O-PS-CfaEB (Fig. 2B, green bar). We observed a sig-
nificant difference in anti-HS3 IgG in the bivalent HS23/36-CfaEB
+ HS3-CssBA group with an average titer of 104.9 (Fig. 2B, purple
Fig. 1. Immunogenicity of an HS23/36-CfaEB conjugate vaccine. CJ- and ETEC-specific IgG antibody responses were measured after two immunizations with a low (10 lg) or
high (60 lg) dose of HS23/36-CfaEB. (A) Anti-HS23/36 CPS IgG and anti-CfaE IgG endpoint titers were measured by ELISA. (B) Functional HAI titers were measured against the

Fig. 2C, green bar). However, a trivalent formulation induced high
levels of Sf-O-PS-specific responses (105.4; Fig. 2C, black bar).
We next analyzed the anti-ETEC protein responses in the multi-
valent vaccine formulations. Two of the conjugate vaccines utilized
CfaEB as a carrier and the mass ratio of polysaccharide:protein dif-
fered for each conjugate (HS23/36-CfaEB: 2.6:1 and Sf-O-PS-CfaEB:
1:2). These experiments gave us an opportunity to measure the
additive effect of CfaEB on anti-CfaE IgG and HAI responses. Com-
bination of HS23/36-CfaEB + HS3-CssBA induced anti-CfaE IgG at
levels similar to HS23/36-CfaEB group (Fig. 3A; purple and red
bars, respectively), consistent with the same 1.3 mg dose of CfaEB

 being delivered in these two formulations (Table 1). Similar func-
tional HAI titers were also observed between these two groups
(Fig. 3B). Combination of HS23/36-CfaEB with Sf-O-PS-CfaEB
(Fig. 3, orange bars) increased the total CfaEB dose delivered to
10.8 mg, and the same dose of CfaEB was delivered in the trivalent
group as well (Fig. 3, black bars). Anti-CfaE IgG titers were signifi-
cantly higher in both the bivalent HS23/36-CfaEB + Sf-O-PS-CfaEB
and the trivalent groups than any of the groups containing lower
amounts of CfaEB including the Sf-O-PS-CfaEB group (Fig. 3A and
Table 1) indicating an additive effect of the two CfaEB-containing
vaccines. This was also partially true when we measured functional
HAI antibody responses (Fig. 3B). The bivalent HS23/36-CfaEB + Sf-
O-PS-CfaEB (orange bars) and the trivalent groups (black bars) had
significantly higher HAI titers than either the HS23/36-CfaEB (red
bar) and the HS23/36-CfaEB + HS3-CssBA (purple bar) groups
where only 1.3 mg of CfaEB were delivered per dose. No significant
difference in HAI titers was observed between groups dosed with
9.5 (Fig. 3B, grey or green bars) or 10.8 mg (orange and black bars)
of CfaEB. As expected, similar levels of anti-CS6 IgG were observed
in all bi- and trivalent vaccine formulations containing the HS3-
CssBA vaccine as the dose of CssBA was constant in all the formu-
lations (Fig. 3C and Table 1).
4. Discussion
Vaccine development is a complex and costly process, from
basic research through pre-clinical and clinical testing. Although
various candidate vaccines against each of the three individual
pathogens discussed here have gone into clinical trials, there are
no licensed vaccines against ETEC, CJ or Shigella. In this study, we
explored whether conjugate vaccines incorporating antigens from
these pathogens can induce a multi-target immune response.
Although conjugate vaccines are complex, they have been remark-
ably effective against a variety of other mucosal pathogens. All
licensed conjugate vaccines use one of a few carrier proteins such
as CRM197 or tetanus toxoid that are unrelated to the targeted
pathogen. Since approaches to Shigella and to CJ involve polysac-
charides, and all subunit approaches to ETEC involve proteins, we
sought to combine the approaches by utilizing ETEC proteins as
carriers for CJ and Shigella polysaccharides.
We synthesized three combinations of antigens: CJ HS23/36
CPS-CfaEB, S. flexneri 2a O-PS-CfaEB and CJ HS3 CPS-CssBA and
demonstrated immunogenicity against the relevant antigens in
monovalent, bivalent, and trivalent formulations. Importantly, we
have demonstrated successful conjugation of CfaEB by two distinct
chemical mechanisms [23,49]. The doses of polysaccharide used in
these studies ranged from 1.5 mg to 5 mg, and the protein doses ran-
ged from 0.8 mg to 10.8 mg (Table 1). We did see a trend toward an
additive effect in terms of protein response when in bivalent and
trivalent formulations of the two conjugates containing higher
doses of CfaEB. Importantly, even low doses of CfaEB in monova-
lent formulations resulted in substantial functional antibodies as
measured by HAI, indicating that chemical conjugation did not
substantially alter the binding domain of the adhesin. Unfortu-
nately, no functional assays exist for the CS6 adhesin. We have
recently observed serum bactericidal activity against CJ in rabbits
immunized with CJ conjugates + Freund’s adjuvant, non-human
primates immunized with CJ conjugates + alum, and mice immu-
nized with conjugates + Toll-like receptor ligand adjuvants (data
not shown). Because the mice in this study were immunized with
a CPS conjugate vaccine alone or the conjugate mixed with alum,
we were unable to detect CJ bactericidal titers in pooled serum
from the mice in this study (data not shown). This is consistent
with our observations that CPS-CRM197 vaccines delivered alone
or with alum in mice primarily induce a T helper cell type 2
(Th2) immune response characterized by primary induction of
anti-CPS IgG1 antibodies which do not activate the classical com-
plement pathway. We also did not detect S. flexneri 2a bactericidal
responses in pooled mouse serum (data not shown) utilizing the
recently described Shigella SBA assay by Nahm et al. [51]. In con-
trast, in a clinical study in which a S. flexneri 2a O-PS bioconjugate
was delivered alone or with alum [52] SBA activity was detected in
the presence or absence of alum. This indicates Th1 activity and
generation of complement-fixing antibody isotypes in human vol-
unteers, although O-PS IgG subclasses were not specifically mea-
sured in the study. Further studies are required to determine
how antibody responses differ between mice and humans vacci-
nated with the same O-PS and whether it is a reflection of differ-
ences in the host immune response and/or carrier proteins and
conjugation methods utilized in these two studies. Future studies
with the conjugate vaccines described here will test adjuvants
known to induce serum bactericidal responses and should allow
measurement of anti-CPS bactericidal titers not just against CJ,
but also anti-O-PS bactericidal responses against Shigella.
Although
these
preliminary
studies
show
this
conjugate
approach is feasible, additional studies remain to be done. The ratio
of polysaccharide to protein in each combination needs additional
experimentation to find an optimum dose of each antigen. Also, as
mentioned above, we are currently evaluating different adjuvants
to improve antibody responses and to potentially reduce the num-
bers of doses required to achieve high antibody titers against all
vaccine components. An additional factor to consider in our multi-
valent conjugate approach is the route of administration and gen-
eration of mucosal immune responses. Current approaches to
generate B and T cell mediated immunity at mucosal sites have pri-
marily centered around direct delivery of live-attenuated vaccines
to mucosal sites (oral or intranasal). However, new evidence sug-
gests that recombinant subunit vaccines delivered parenterally
with the appropriate adjuvant may stimulate mucosal immunity
[53]. ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) and cholera toxin are some of
the few adjuvants identified with these capabilities and future
studies are planned to incorporate mutant LT potentially with
other
immunopotentiating
adjuvants
to
enhance
mucosal
responses to our conjugate vaccines.
Current estimations of the valencies that would be required for
an effective CJ CPS vaccine would be 8 (Poly et al., unpublished)
and that for a Shigella O-PS vaccine would be 4 [25]. Since there
are 4–5 main classes of ETEC adhesins [54], the final formulation
of such a multivalent, multi-pathogen conjugate vaccine would
be at maximum 12-valent. Thus, each of the 4 ETEC proteins would
be conjugated to three of the 12 relevant polysaccharides, a com-
plexity that is similar to licensed pneumococcal conjugate vac-
cines. Valency may be reduced by inclusion of a more common
ETEC protein (e.g. EtpA) and/or a CJ protein that is shared among
strains as carriers.
