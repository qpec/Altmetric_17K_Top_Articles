Abstract
Abstract
Objective — To test the hypotheses that physical activity in midlife is
not associated with a reduced risk of dementia and that the preclinical
phase of dementia is characterised by a decline in physical activity.
Design — Prospective cohort study with a mean follow-up of 27 years.
Setting — Civil service departments in London (Whitehall II study).
Participants — 10 308 participants aged 35-55 years at study inception
(1985-88). Exposures included time spent in mild, moderate to vigorous,
and total physical activity assessed seven times between 1985 and 2013
and categorised as “recommended” if duration of moderate to vigorous
physical activity was 2.5 hours/week or more.
Main outcome measures — A battery of cognitive tests was
administered up to four times from 1997 to 2013, and incident dementia
cases (n=329) were identified through linkage to hospital, mental health
services, and mortality registers until 2015.
Results — Mixed effects models showed no association between
physical activity and subsequent 15 year cognitive decline. Similarly,
Cox regression showed no association between physical activity and
risk of dementia over an average 27 year follow-up (hazard ratio in the
“recommended” physical activity category 1.00, 95% confidence interval
0.80 to 1.24). For trajectories of hours/week of total, mild, and moderate
to vigorous physical activity in people with dementia compared with
those without dementia (all others), no differences were observed
between 28 and 10 years before diagnosis of dementia. However,
physical activity in people with dementia began to decline up to nine
years before diagnosis (difference in moderate to vigorous physical
activity −0.39 hours/week; P=0.05), and the difference became more
pronounced (−1.03 hours/week; P=0.005) at diagnosis.
Conclusion — This study found no evidence of a neuroprotective effect
of physical activity. Previous findings showing a lower risk of dementia
in physically active people may be attributable to reverse causation—that
is, due to a decline in physical activity levels in the preclinical phase of
dementia.
Introduction
The World Health Organization estimated that 47 million cases
dementia existed worldwide in 2015 and predicted that this may
triple by 2050 owing to ageing of the population.1 In the absence
of a cure, prevention studies are important to identify modifiable
risk factors and protective factors to delay the onset or reduce
the risk of dementia.2 Considerable research has focused on the
protective role of physical activity.3-7 Several meta-analysis of
observational studies suggest a protective effect of physical
activity at recommended levels for cognitive decline and risk
of dementia.3-9 Although intervention studies are not able to
study the effects of long term physical activity, the evidence
from such studies is inconsistent; some studies suggest protective
effects,10 11 whereas most recent studies show no effects.12-15
Dementia is a progressive disorder involving changes over a
long preclinical period,16 which might include alterations in
physical activity. Thus, studies with short follow-up times,
typically less than 10 years, cannot distinguish causal effects
from those due to preclinical changes (that is, reverse causation).
Accordingly, the evidence for protective effects of physical
activity is more consistent in studies with short rather than long
follow-up times.4-20 To uncover the role of physical activity, we
used data spanning nearly three decades to investigate the
association between physical activity and cognitive function at
ages 50, 60, 70, and 80 years; examine the association of
physical activity with subsequent 15 year cognitive decline;
assess the association between midlife physical activity and the
risk of dementia; and model changes in physical activity over
28 years before diagnosis of dementia by using a backwards
timescale anchored to year of diagnosis. We also examined

 whether associations were similar by assessing mild, moderate
to vigorous, and total physical activity.
Methods
Population
The Whitehall II study is an ongoing cohort study of men and
women originally employed by the British civil service in
London based offices.21 A total of 10 308 people (6895 men and
3413 women, aged 35-55) were recruited over the years 1985
to 1988. Since baseline, follow-up clinical examinations have
taken place approximately every five years, with the latest one
completed in 2012-13.
Patient involvement
Participants in the Whitehall II study were not involved in setting
the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they
involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or
implementation of the study. No participants were asked to
advise on interpretation or writing up of results. However, all
results are disseminated to study participants via newsletters
and our website, which has a participant portal (https://www.
ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII/participants/). Starting in 2015, a randomly
selected set of participants are also involved in a consultation
exercise to shape our research on ageing.
Measures
Physical activity
Physical activity was assessed using a questionnaire, seven
times over 28 years. At the first three assessments (1985-88,
1988-90, and 1991-93), participants were asked about the
frequency and duration of participation in mildly energetic (eg,
weeding, general housework, bicycle repair), moderately
energetic (eg, dancing, cycling, leisurely swimming), and
vigorous physical activity (eg, running, hard swimming, playing
squash). Examples for each level of physical activity were
provided to ease interpretation. The questionnaire was modified
to reflect the Minnesota leisure-time physical activity
questionnaire,22 starting from the 1997-99 wave, to include 20
items on frequency and duration of various activities (eg,
walking, cycling, sports). For each activity, including the open
ended items, we assigned a metabolic equivalent (MET) value
by using a compendium of activity energy costs.23 One MET
reflects the intensity of activity relative to lying quietly: we
coded activities with MET less than 3 as mild physical activity
and those with MET of 3 or more as moderate to vigorous
physical activity.24 The sum of all physical activity denoted total
physical activity. We defined “recommended physical activity”
by using WHO criteria of moderate to vigorous physical activity
at least 2.5 hours/week.25 These measures of physical activity
have been shown to be associated with cardiometabolic
outcomes in the Whitehall II study.26-30
Cognitive function
The cognitive test battery, introduced to the study in 1997-99
and repeated using the same tests at all subsequent assessments,
allowed analysis using four waves of data between 1997 (age
of participants 45-69 years) and 2013 (age 60-84 years).31 The
tests have good test-retest reliability (range 0.6-0.9), assessed
in 556 participants and retested within three months in 1997-99.
The cognitive domains assessed were as follows. Memory was
assessed using a 20 word free recall test. Participants were
presented a list of one or two syllable words at two second
intervals and were then asked to recall in writing as many of
the words as possible in any order with two minutes to do so.
Executive function was assessed with the Alice Heim 4-I test,
which is composed of a series of 65 verbal and mathematical
reasoning items of increasing difficulty.32 It tests inductive
reasoning, measuring the ability to identify patterns and infer
principles and rules. Participants had 10 minutes to do this
section. Fluency was assessed using measures of phonemic and
semantic fluency.33 Participants were asked to recall in writing
as many words beginning with “s” (phonemic fluency) and as
many animal names (semantic fluency) as they could. One
minute was allowed for each test.
In addition to three cognitive domains, we created a global
cognitive score incorporating all tests described above by firstly
using the distribution of the first wave of cognitive data
(1997-99) to standardise the raw scores for each domain to z
scores (mean=0; standard deviation=1). We summed these z
scores and restandardised them to yield the global score, an
approach that minimises measurement error inherent in
individual tests.34
Dementia
We used comprehensive tracing of electronic health records for
ascertainment of dementia in three databases: the national
Hospital Episode Statistics database, the Mental Health Services
Data Set (MHSDS), and the mortality register. Record linkage
until 31 March 2015, using ICD-10 (international classification
of diseases 10th edition) codes F00, F01, F02, F03, F05.1, G30,
G31.0, G31.1, and G31.8 identified cases of dementia. The NHS
in the UK (England, Scotland, and Wales) provides most of the
healthcare, including outpatient and inpatient care; private
medical insurance, held by around 12% of the UK population
(1997 figures),35 is mainly used for elective surgery rather than
chronic conditions such as dementia. MHSDS is a national
database that contains information for people in contact with
mental health services in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and the
community. Mortality data came from the British national
mortality register (NHS Central Registry). The tracing exercise
used the unique NHS identification number given to each
resident in the UK. We set date of dementia at the first record
of a diagnosis of dementia in any of the three databases used
for ascertainment.
The validity of dementia cases in our study is supported by
modelling changes in the global cognitive score over 18 years
before diagnosis of dementia. These results show accelerated
decline in global cognitive score in the 8-10 years before
diagnosis of dementia (supplementary figure A), as has been
shown in studies that use a “gold standard” dementia
ascertainment procedure.36
Covariates (1985 to 2013)
Sociodemographic variables included age, sex, ethnicity (white
versus non-white), marital status (married/cohabiting versus
others), socioeconomic status using occupational position (three
categories: high, intermediate, and low representing income and
status at work), and education (five categories: less than primary
school (up to age 11), lower secondary school (up to age 16),
higher secondary school (up to age 18), university, and higher
university degree). Occupational position and marital status
were updated at each wave.
Health behaviours were assessed by questionnaire and included
smoking (current smokers, ex-smokers, and never smokers),
alcohol consumption (number of alcoholic drinks consumed in
the previous seven days, converted to units of alcohol consumed
in a week and categorized as “no/occasional alcohol

 consumption,” “moderate alcohol consumption” (1-14
units/week in women, 1-21 units/week in men), and “heavy
alcohol consumption” (≥14 units in women, ≥21 units in
men)),37 and dietary behaviour (frequency of fruit and vegetables
consumption in a week).
Health related covariates included symptoms of anxiety and
depression (30 item General Health Questionnaire),38
hypertension (systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg
or use of antihypertensive drugs), prevalent diabetes mellitus
(determined by fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L, reported diabetes
diagnosed by a doctor, or use of diabetes drugs), body mass
index assessed at the clinical examination (categorised as <20,
20-25, 25-30, and ≥30), cardiovascular diseases (including
coronary heart disease and stroke (identified using linkage to
national hospital records)), self reported use of drugs for
cardiovascular disease, and the physical component score of
the SF-36 (self rated physical functioning).39
Statistical analysis
We did three sets of analyses, described below (see
supplementary figure B for flowchart). For the first two analyses,
we categorised physical activity (total, mild, and moderate to
vigorous) into approximate thirds; we also categorised physical
activity at moderate to vigorous intensity by using the WHO
recommended level of at least 2.5 hours/week. For the final
analysis, we modelled physical activity (total, mild, and
moderate to vigorous) as a continuous variable (hours/week).
When cognitive function is the outcome, we present results
using the global cognitive score; results using individual
cognitive tests are shown in the supplementary materials.
Association between physical activity and
cognitive function
These analyses were based on 7424 participants with data on
cognitive function (added to the study protocol only in 1997-99).
We first examined whether the association between physical
activity over the follow-up (from 1997-99 to 2012-13) and
cognitive function (time varying from 1997-99 onwards)
changed with age by using linear mixed effect models with age
as timescale and time varying physical activity and cognitive
function. This model also included age (centred at mean age
(65 years) over the follow-up period), age2, five year birth
cohort, sociodemographic factors, health behaviours, and
interaction terms of age and age2 with both time varying physical
activity categories and time invariant variables (sex, education,
ethnicity); see equation 1 in supplementary methods. We then
adjusted the analyses for time dependent health related measures.
To ease presentation of the results, we compared estimated
differences (and 95% confidence intervals) in cognitive scores
in the intermediate and high physical activity categories against
“low” physical activity at age 50, 60, 70, and 80 years. For the
test of change in the association between physical activity level
and cognition with age, we examined whether the interaction
terms of physical activity groups with age and age2 improved
model fit by using the Wald test.
We then examined whether physical activity in 1997-99 was
associated with cognitive decline over 15 years (1997-99 to
2012-13) by using linear mixed effect models, with intercept
and slope fitted as random effects.29 The basic model included
the following terms: time of follow-up starting from 1997-99,
time2, age in 1997-99 (centred at mean age (55 years)), sex,
physical activity, their interactions with time, and the interaction
between age and time2 to account for accelerated cognitive
decline at older ages (supplementary methods, equation 2). We
used the interaction between physical activity and time to test
for differences in cognitive decline between the categories of
physical activity. The analyses were further adjusted for
sociodemographic variables, behavioural variables, and their
interactions with time. Finally, we added health related variables
with their interactions with time to the model. We examined
whether age modified the association of physical activity with
cognitive decline by using interaction terms between physical
activity, time, and age (continuous variable).
Association between physical activity and risk of
incident dementia
We examined the association of physical activity (categories
and then as a continuous variable) assessed in 1985-88 (study
recruitment) and dementia in all 10 308 participants recruited
to the study in 1985-88 by using Cox regression with age as the
timescale (supplementary methods, equation 3). Participants
were censored at date of record of dementia, death (to account
for competing risk of mortality), or 31 March 2015, whichever
came first. Covariates (sociodemographic variables, health
behaviours, health status) were drawn from the 1985-88 wave.
Trajectories of physical activity before dementia
The aim of these analyses was to examine differences in
trajectories of physical activity (hours/week of total, mild, and
moderate to vigorous activity) in people with dementia compared
with those free of dementia. We used a backwards timescale,36
such that year=0 in the analysis was the year of dementia
diagnosis for cases, year of death for those who died during the
follow-up, and end of follow-up (31 March 2015) for all others.
We modelled physical activity trajectories over 28 years before
year 0 by using mixed effects models, with random intercept
and slope, and hours/week of physical activity as the dependent
variable. Cubic regression splines, used in exploratory analyses
to verify the shape of trajectories of physical activity, suggested
a cubic polynomial shape (supplementary figure C). Thus, we
used a mixed model with dementia (coded as 1 for cases and 0
for all others) and its interaction with slope terms (time, time2,
and time3) to test for differences in physical activity trajectories
between dementia cases and all others by assessing whether the
interaction terms improved the fit of the model with the Wald
test. This method also allowed the estimation of differences in
physical activity between cases and non-cases for each year
over the 28 year follow-up. The analysis was adjusted for five
year cohort of birth and time dependent (when relevant)
sociodemographic and behavioural covariates and interactions
of time invariant variables with time, time2, and time3
(supplementary methods, equation 4). We repeated these
analyses using a case-control approach to better control for
confounders and period effects inherent to the diagnosis of
dementia (see supplementary methods).
Sensitivity analysis
Data on type of dementia were incomplete in the electronic
health records, not allowing us to test the salience of physical
activity by subtypes of dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease.
However, as complete history of cardiovascular disease in our
participants was available over the follow-up, we categorised
dementia cases into dementia with and without a history of
cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or stroke). For
each of these outcomes (the other being censored in the analysis
at age of dementia diagnosis), we used Cox regression to
examine associations with physical activity. Trajectories of
physical activity before dementia using a three category

 dementia variable (no dementia, dementia with cardiovascular
disease history, and without cardiovascular disease history)
allowed us to examine changes in physical activity in relation
to these subtypes of dementia.
To determine whether poor sensitivity of our method of
dementia ascertainment affected the results, we simulated
scenarios with differential misclassification—that is, the
hypothesis that the probability of dementia misclassification
depends on physical activity—by using an SAS macro provided
by Fox et al.40 We allowed the sensitivity to vary between 50%
and 80% and specificity between 97% and 100% with a
trapezoidal probability density function. We simulated two
scenarios: one in which the correlation between the sensitivity
distribution in people following recommendations and the
sensitivity distribution in all others was 0.8 and then one in
which it was 0.6 (and similarly for the correlations of the
specificity distributions); note that a correlation of 1 corresponds
to non-differential misclassification.
Results
Over a mean follow-up of 26.6 (SD 4.5; range 0.18-29.6) years,
a total of 329 cases of dementia were recorded. The mean age
at diagnosis was 75.0 (SD 5.4; interquartile range 72.0-79.2;
range 53.4-83.6) years, and 73% (n=240) of the cases were
recorded in the last five years of follow-up. Increasing age
(hazard ratio per 1 year greater age at study baseline 1.21, 95%
confidence interval 1.19 to 1.24), female sex (1.58, 1.27 to 1.96),
and education less than secondary school diploma (1.76, 1.41
to 2.19) were associated with greater hazard of dementia. ⇓

Association between physical activity and
cognitive function
Of the 7424 participants in these analyses, 42% (n=3144) had
cognitive data at all four waves, 29% (n=2168) at three waves,
15% (n=1091) at two waves, and 14% (n=1021) at only one
wave. Supplementary table A shows the association between
physical activity and global cognitive z score at ages 50, 60, 70,
and 80 years in models adjusted for sociodemographic and
behavioural factors. For all measures of physical activity, the
association with the global cognitive score was stronger at older
ages (all P for interaction with age <0.05). Although these
differences were considerably attenuated in the fully adjusted
models, the association between physical activity and cognitive
function was stronger at older ages except for mild physical
activity (⇓). Compared with people not following physical
activity recommendations, those following recommendations
had similar cognitive function at age 50 (difference in global
cognitive z score 0.03, 95% confidence interval −0.01 to 0.07),
but at age 80 they had on average a global cognitive z score
0.12 (0.07 to 0.18) standard deviations higher. Mutual
adjustment for mild and moderate to vigorous intensity physical
activity showed similar findings (P for interaction with age=0.23
and 0.005, respectively; data not tabulated). The results were
similar when cognitive domains were examined separately
(supplementary tables B-D).
Mean 15 year decline in the global cognitive z score was 0.61
(0.59 to 0.63) of the baseline standard deviation. We found no
association between physical activity, assessed in 1997-99, and
subsequent 15 year decline in the global cognitive z score (⇓);
age did not modify this association (all P for interaction >0.19).
We obtained a similar pattern of results for the three cognitive
domains (supplementary tables E-G).
Association between physical activity and
dementia
Age at diagnosis of dementia was similar in the categories used
to define physical activity: 74.9, 74.9, and 75.2 years in the low,
intermediate, and high total physical activity categories (P=0.90).
⇓ shows no association between physical activity, assessed in
1985-88, and incidence of dementia, with follow-up until 2015.
The lack of association was observed for total physical activity
and both mild and moderate to vigorous intensity activity.
Trajectories of physical activity before
dementia
Participants following physical activity recommendations over
the data waves were as follows: 52% (5347/10 308) in 1985-88,
48% (3663/7563) in 1988-90, 49% (4097/8319) in 1991-93,
51% (3623/7153) in 1997-99, 56% (3811/6786) in 2002-04,
56% (3693/6611) in 2007-09, and 55% (3402/6207) in 2012-13.
⇓ shows that trajectories of hours/week of total, mild, and
moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity differed between
dementia cases and all non-cases (P≤0.001). Physical activity
was lower in dementia cases than in others, starting up to nine
years before diagnosis (−0.39 hour/week for moderate to
vigorous intensity physical activity; P=0.05), with a difference
of −4.20 hours/week (P<0.001) for total physical activity and
−1.03 hours/week (P=0.005) for moderate to vigorous intensity
physical activity at year 0 (the year of dementia diagnosis;
supplementary table H). We found no difference in physical
activity between the two groups between 28 and 10 years before
diagnosis of dementia (supplementary table H). Analysis using
a case-control approach showed similar results (P for difference
in trajectories <0.001 for all physical activity measures;
supplementary figure D and table I).
Sensitivity analysis
We found no association between physical activity in 1985-88
and risk of dementia with (n=111) or without (n=218) a history
of cardiovascular disease (supplementary tables J and K). The
trajectories of physical activity over 28 years suggest that the
decline in physical activity in the preclinical phase of dementia
was greater in people with dementia who had a history of
cardiovascular disease (supplementary figure E).
The associations between physical activity and dementia
examined under the hypothesis of differential misclassification
of dementia are shown in supplementary table L. They do not
suggest any association between physical activity at
recommended levels and risk of dementia.
Discussion
This longitudinal study with data on physical activity spanning
up to 28 years has three key findings. Firstly, the difference in
the global cognitive score between people following and not
following recommendations on moderate to vigorous physical
activity was four times as large at age 80 as at age 50. Secondly,
15 year decline in the global cognitive score was similar in all
groups defined by physical activity, irrespective of duration or
intensity of activity. We found no evidence that this pattern of
results varied as a function of cognitive tests. Thirdly, physical
activity in midlife was not associated with risk of dementia or
with dementia classified using cardiovascular history as a proxy
for dementia subtypes. The findings on dementia were
corroborated in analysis of trajectories of physical activity over
28 years showing that hours/week of physical activity (both
mild and moderate-to-vigorous intensity) did not differ in

 dementia cases and non-cases between 28 to 10 years before
diagnosis. However, physical activity levels began to decline
in people with dementia, starting nine years before diagnosis.
Taken together, these findings do not suggest a causal effect of
physical activity on cognitive decline or risk of dementia. The
lack of association between physical activity and cognitive
decline and the divergence in physical activity trajectories
emerging only in the nine years before diagnosis of dementia
(that is, the preclinical phase) lead us to conclude that physical
activity does not affect the risk of dementia.
Strengths and limitations of study
This study has several strengths. Firstly, repeat assessment of
physical activity over 28 years allowed us to examine trajectories
of physical activity before diagnosis of dementia by using an
innovative analytical strategy anchored to the cause of disease,
reflected in use of the backwards timescale. Conventional
analysis tends to use wave of data collection to study change,
which is not optimal when preclinical disease affects risk factor
levels. We were also able to assess associations with both mild
and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. Sensitivity
analysis using a case-control approach (six matched controls
for each dementia case) ensured better control for confounding
(by age, sex, and education) and period effects that may affect
diagnosis of dementia.36
A key limitation of the study concerns the ascertainment of
dementia based on linkage to electronic health records. In the
Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and the Adult Changes study,
comparison of passive case finding with an active approach
showed the passive approach to have high specificity and
approximately 70% sensitivity and to miss mostly milder cases
of dementia.41 A similar pattern is likely in our study, as health
coverage is universal in the UK and electronic health records
have been shown to be reliable for ascertainment of dementia
status.42 In addition, undiagnosed dementia becomes common
only in very old age,43 and we found no evidence that physical
activity at baseline affected age at diagnosis of dementia. Thus,
any misclassification of dementia status is likely to be random
(that is, the probability of dementia status being misclassified
is independent of physical activity), and sensitivity analysis
simulating differential misclassification showed our results to
be robust. Furthermore, our results on cognitive decline are in
accordance with other longitudinal studies showing no
association between physical activity and cognitive ageing.4-14
Finally, another limitation concerns the change in the physical
activity questionnaire in 1997-99 that could distort the
trajectories of physical activity before diagnosis of dementia.
However, analysis based on the case-control design, in which
cases and their controls had the same questionnaires across data
waves, suggested similar results.
Comparison with other studies
Previous reviews of observational studies concluded that higher
levels of physical activity are associated with a slower rate of
cognitive decline.3-9 These conclusions are in stark contrast to
meta-analyses of intervention studies, particularly recent data,
which do not show a protective effect of physical activity on
cognition.10-15 This inconsistency has raised concerns about the
causal nature of the association between physical activity and
cognitive outcomes. Interventions use objective measures of
physical activity, whereas a lot of the observational data come
from self reported measures of physical activity. Our results are
based on reported physical activity; however, as reporting biases
at the start of the study are unlikely to be affected by dementia
status (mean follow-up 26.6 years), this is an unlikely source
of major bias for the observed associations between physical
activity and dementia in our study. A further source of
inconsistency in results in this domain is that much of the
evidence comes from studies in which physical activity was
measured at older age (65 years or more) and the follow-up was
short (less than 10 years),4-47 making them prone to reverse
causation biases. Secondly, the conclusions from some
longitudinal studies do not differentiate findings on cognitive
performance from those on cognitive decline.4 9 Our analyses
show that associations between physical activity and cognitive
performance are stronger at older ages; a possible explanation
for this pattern is decline in physical activity in people with
cognitive impairment or in the preclinical phase of dementia.
Thirdly, some previous studies did not include critical
confounding factors, such as sociodemographic factors and
health behaviours, in their analysis.4 9
Apart from notable exceptions,8-48 most previous studies on
dementia are in older adults in whom preclinical dementia or
cognitively impairment at recruitment into the study is difficult
to rule out. Dementia is now widely recognised as involving a
long preclinical period that unfolds over several years, perhaps
decades,16 49 which affects various processes, including risk
factor levels. As a consequence, the risk factor-dementia
association drawn from studies based on older adults is likely
to be subject to reverse causation biases. In our study, physical
activity started to decline up to nine years before diagnosis of
dementia, resulting in lower physical activity levels in dementia
cases. However, we found no differences in physical activity
levels in dementia cases compared with others from year −28
to −10 before diagnosis. The results were similar for mild and
moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity, suggesting that
all types of physical activity decline in the years preceding
dementia. Data on physical activity spanning 28 years allowed
us to characterise the trajectory of physical activity and to
provide potential explanations for studies in older adults with
short follow-up that have found higher levels of physical activity
to have a protective effect on dementia.4
Results from studies with a long follow-up are also
inconsistent.4-19 The Caerphilly Prospective Study and the Adult
Health Study found no association between midlife physical
activity and incidence of dementia at older ages.8 48 However,
data from the AGES-Reykjavik Study and CAIDE
(Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Ageing, and Dementia) show that
people who were less active in midlife had a higher risk of
dementia at older ages.18 19 Intriguingly, the CAIDE study found
no association between physical activity and dementia when
analyses were based on the entire target population (n=544
(15.3%) dementia cases out of 3559 people) and electronic
health records were used to identify dementia cases; in contrast,
a protective effect was seen in the subsample (n=250 (16.5%)
dementia cases out of 1511 participants) in which participants
attended a clinical examination to have cognitive tests 20 and
28 years after recruitment to the study.19 Given a 1.2% higher
rate of dementia when it is ascertained using a clinical
examination, the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear:
selective mortality and attrition may have contributed to these
inconsistent results from the same study.19 In the Rotterdam
study in adults aged 61 to 97 years at study baseline, the
marginal protective effect of greater physical activity for
dementia was evident only when short follow-up was used,17
pointing to potential biases due to reverse causation. Physical
activity is known to be associated with cardiometabolic
outcomes, including in our study26-30; as these are known to be
risk factors for dementia,2 one would expect physical activity
to be associated with dementia. However, as dementia is a

 disease of old age, participants need to live long enough to
develop it. A total of 1653 participants in our study died over
the follow-up; mean age at death was 67.6 years, whereas mean
age at diagnosis of dementia was 75.0 years.
Conclusion
Given rapid increases in life expectancy, dementia is
increasingly a public health challenge and the need to identify
modifiable risk factors that prevent or delay dementia onset has
never been greater. Owing to its cardioprotective effect, physical
activity has been put forward as a possible candidate. The
evidence from our study, which examined both cognitive decline
and dementia, challenges this hypothesis and provides no
evidence for a neuroprotective effect. Physical activity levels
were lower in the years leading up to diagnosis of dementia,
suggesting that changes in physical activity might simply be
part of the preclinical symptoms of dementia. We found no
evidence of a slower rate of cognitive decline in people doing
more physical activity. These findings are in accordance with
results from recent randomised control trials,10-14 including the
most recent LIFE study based on a 24 month intervention and
the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial based on a 36
month intervention, which failed to find an effect of the
intervention on cognitive function and incidence of dementia.12 15
What is already known on this topic
Meta-analyses of observational studies conclude
that physical activity is a protective factor for
cognitive decline and risk of dementia,
particularly in on older adults followed for less
than 10 years
However, the most recent Cochrane review on
the effect of aerobic intervention on cognition
did not show any evidence of benefit
The inclusion of physical activity in guidelines
to tackle the burden of dementia seems not be
based on robust evidence of a protective effect
of physical activity
What this study adds
Physical activity (mild and moderate to vigorous
intensity), assessed seven times over 28 years,
did not have a protective effect for cognitive
decline or risk of dementia
Trajectories of physical activity showed no
difference between dementia cases and
non-cases in the 28 to 10 years before
diagnosis, with decline in physical activity
starting up to nine years before diagnosis
These results suggest that a decrease in
physical activity could be part of the cascade of
changes occurring in the preclinical phase of
dementia
