Djogo et al. show that ablation of
NG2-glia, but not microglia, in the median
eminence (ME) leads to selective
degeneration of LepR dendrites in the
arcuate nucleus, causing primary leptin
resistance and obesity. These effects are
reproduced with ME-directed
X-irradiation, possibly explaining the
obesity risk associated with cranial
radiation therapy.

SUMMARY
While leptin is a well-known regulator of body fat
mass, it remains unclear how circulating leptin is
sensed centrally to maintain energy homeostasis.
Here we show that genetic and pharmacological
ablation of adult NG2-glia (also known as oligoden-
drocyte precursors), but not microglia, leads to pri-
mary leptin resistance and obesity in mice. We reveal
that NG2-glia contact the dendritic processes of
arcuate nucleus leptin receptor (LepR) neurons in
the median eminence (ME) and that these processes
degenerate upon NG2-glia elimination, which ex-
plains the consequential attenuation of these neu-
rons’ molecular and electrical responses to leptin.
Our data therefore indicate that LepR dendrites in
the ME represent the principal conduits of leptin’s
anorexigenic action and that NG2-glia are essential
for their maintenance. Given that ME-directed X-irra-
diation confirmed the pharmacological and geneti-
cally mediated ablation effects on body weight, our
findings provide a rationale for the known obesity
risk associated with cranial radiation therapy.
INTRODUCTION
While much knowledge has been accumulated about the archi-
tecture and function of the hypothalamic neurocircuits that
control energy balance (Morton et al., 2014), we still know very
little about if and how glial cells contribute to the function of these
circuits (Balland et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2014; Garcı
´a-Ca
´ ceres
et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2012; Thaler et al., 2012).
We have shown previously that new cells are constitutively
born in the adult hypothalamus (Kokoeva et al., 2005, 2007),
including its mediobasal portion, and that the majority of prolifer-
ating cells in this brain area are NG2-glia (Robins et al., 2013b,
2013c). NG2-glia represent a major glia cell class known for their
role as precursors to oligodendrocytes (Dimou and Gallo, 2015).
Despite their dense presence throughout the CNS, including the
hypothalamus, their physiological significance in the adult brain
has only recently begun to be explored. White matter NG2-glia
have been shown to contribute to myelination even post-devel-
opment (Young et al., 2013), and this myelination improves mo-
tor skill learning (McKenzie et al., 2014). NG2-glia receive synap-
tic input from neurons (Bergles et al., 2000; De Biase et al., 2010),
and optogenetic stimulation of premotor cortex neurons not only
promotes NG2-glia proliferation, oligodendrogenesis, and mye-
lination, but also leads to improved motor function (Gibson et al.,
2014). Interestingly, this glia class exhibits a profound potency
to regenerate in the adult brain (Hughes et al., 2013; Irvine and
Blakemore, 2007; Robins et al., 2013c). Even when NG2-glia
are acutely eliminated from large portions of the periventricular
parenchyma upon intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of
the
mitotic
blocker
cytosine-b-D-arabinofuranoside
(AraC),
NG2-glia coverage is fully restored within weeks following their
ablation
(Robins
et
al.,
2013c).
Mitotic
blocker-mediated
NG2-glia cell death is thought to prompt cell division in neigh-
boring, previously mitotically quiescent NG2-glia, which then in
turn become vulnerable to AraC (Robins et al., 2013c). This
knockon effect seems to be the ultimate cause of the wide-
spread and complete elimination of periventricular NG2-glia
upon i.c.v. AraC infusion, despite the fact that in the hypothala-
mus only 10% of the NG2-glia population is typically mitotically
active during the time span of the infusion period (Robins et al.,
2013c; Figures 1A–1D).
One of the central sites of energy balance regulation is the
arcuate nucleus (ArcN) located at the base of the mediobasal
hypothalamus (Williams and Elmquist, 2012). This nucleus is
ventrally abutted by the median eminence (ME), a structure that
is partitioned from the brain parenchyma by tanycyte processes
and that contains fenestrated capillaries, a hallmark of circum-
ventricular organs (Rodrı
´guez et al., 2010). While there is strong
evidence that LepR neurons residing in the ArcN and other hypo-
thalamic sites are crucial for body weight control (Vong et al.,
2011), it is still unclear how the adipocyte-derived, anorexigenic

 hormone leptin is sensed by the mediobasal feeding circuits
(Mu
¨ nzberg and Morrison, 2015). The finding that intraperitoneal-
injected, radio-labeled leptin specifically accumulates in the ME
(Banks et al., 1996) indicates that this circumventricular organ
may play an important role in leptin sensing. Indeed, it has been
suggested that leptin exits the fenestrated capillaries of the ME
via passive diffusion and that the hormone is then detected by
LepR neuronal processes of the ArcN that reach into the ME
(Faouzi et al., 2007). However, it also has been proposed that lep-
tin is actively transported across the blood brain barrier (Banks
et al., 1996; Golden et al., 1997).

sensing by the CNS.
RESULTS
Central Mitotic Blocker Infusion
Results in an Obese Phenotype
The i.c.v. infusion of the mitotic blocker
AraC in mice resulted in widespread and
comprehensive ablation of NG2-glia in
the periventricular parenchyma, including
the hypothalamus (Figures 1A–1D), within
1 week. Concomitantly, AraC infusion led
to a profound and sustained increase in
food intake and body weight in both
male and female mice (Figures 1E and
1F). The change in food consumption
was observable as early as 3 days after
the initiation of AraC infusion, and food intake was selectively
increased during the light period (Figures S1A and S1B). The
latter finding is reminiscent of rodents lacking leptin or its recep-
tor globally, which show a profound increase in food intake that is
most prominent during the light period (Becker and Grinker,
1977; Ho and Chin, 1988). AraC-infused mice showed a decline
in daily locomotor activity, specifically at night, which reached
significance only in females (Figures S1C–S1E). Given the
apparent reduction of the day:night difference in food intake
and activity, we examined master circadian pacemaker proper-
ties in AraC-infused mice by monitoring wheel-running activity

 under constant dark conditions (Figures S1F–S1J). We did not
detect any abnormalities in circadian period (Figure S1I) or
amplitude (Figure S1J), suggesting that rhythm generation by
the master clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is not affected
by periventricular NG2-glia ablation. Consistent with an obese
phenotype, the AraC-induced weight gain was associated with
a selective increase in body fat mass (Figure 1G).
The Third Ventricular Parenchyma Mediates the
Obesogenic Effect of Mitotic Blockade
To identify the periventricular brain site that mediates the AraC ef-
fect on body weight, we aimed to regionally restrict mitotic
blocker action by infusing AraC at different sites within the ven-
tricular system (Figure S2M). As predicted by the direction of
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, infusing AraC into the lateral
ventricle was found to profoundly ablate NG2 cells not only at
the infusion site but also in the parenchyma surrounding the third
and fourth ventricles (compare Figures S2A–S2C with S2D–S2F).
NG2-glia in the lateral ventricular parenchyma were, however,
spared when AraC was directly infused into the third ventricle
(Figures S2G–S2I), as were the lateral and third ventricular paren-
chyma upon infusion into the fourth ventricle (Figures S2J–S2L).
Having established that site-specific AraC infusion corre-
sponded to site-specific ablation of NG2-glia, we next assessed
energy homeostasis in such treated animals. Mice that were
AraC infused into the third ventricle showed increases in food
intake (not shown) and weight gain comparable to mice that
received AraC via the lateral ventricle (Figures 1H and 1I),
whereas infusion into the fourth ventricle led to a slight and
only transient weight decrease (Figure 1J). These results suggest
that AraC’s obesogenic effect is mediated via the region sur-
rounding the third ventricle, i.e., the hypothalamus.
Microglia Ablation Does Not Increase Body Weight
Although proliferating NG2-glia make up more than 80% of the
dividing cells in the adult hypothalamus (Robins et al., 2013c),
it is important to consider whether AraC can affect other cell
types in the CNS. We previously concluded that the number
and morphology of both neurons and astrocytes were not altered
by AraC infusion, which is consistent with their status as postmi-
totic cells (Robins et al., 2013c). We did, however, observe a
slight depopulation of microglia, which was temporary and
affected a much smaller area (Robins et al., 2013c). To test if
ablation of microglia, which represent the second largest group
of dividing cells in the hypothalamus and the ME (Figures
S3A–S3C), alternatively accounts for the obese phenotype, we
treated animals with PLX3397, a colony-stimulating factor 1 re-
ceptor (CSF1R) inhibitor. In the adult brain, CSF1R is exclusively
expressed by microglia, and, when PLX3397 is provided in the
diet, it leads to selective and comprehensive ablation of micro-
glia from the mouse brain (Elmore et al., 2014). Indeed, when
adult C57BL/6J mice were switched to PLX3397-containing
chow, we observed an almost complete elimination of microglia
throughout the hypothalamus, while NG2-glia numbers re-
mained unaffected (Figures 2A–2C). Importantly, the treatment
had no effect on body weights (Figure 2D), and body weights
continued to be indistinguishable between the groups after a re-
turn to regular chow (Figure 2D, arrow), which is known to result
in the restoration of microglia coverage (Elmore et al., 2014).
Genetic Ablation of Proliferating NG2-Glia Leads to
Weight Gain
To further corroborate that it is indeed the cells of the NG2-glia
class whose ablation results in the energy balance deficit, we
employed mice (Sox10-CreER, Esco2fl/fl) that were homozygous
for a conditional (floxed) allele of the establishment of cohesion 1
homolog 2 gene (Esco2) (Whelan et al., 2012) and carried a
Sox10-iCreERT2 transgene (Simon et al., 2012). ESCO2 activity
is essential for cell division and its absence causes dividing cells
to die (Whelan et al., 2012), while Sox10 is a marker for oligoden-
drocytes (OLGs) and their precursors, i.e., NG2-glia. Tamoxifen
(TX)-mediated Cre activation in adult Sox10-CreER, Esco2fl/fl
mice thus produces mice that lack ESCO2 in both OLGs and
NG2-glia, which consequently leads to the selective ablation of
dividing NG2-glia (Figure S3D, circles), but not OLGs, as they
are postmitotic (Figure S3D, hexagons). To enable assessment
of NG2-glia ablation, we generated mice that additionally carried
a GFP reporter allele (Sox10-CreER, Esco2fl/fl, GFP).
Brains were inspected at 1 and 16 weeks post-induction of
recombination (wpi) for the expression of NG2 and GFP (Fig-
ure S3D). As recombination efficacy is expected to be less
then 100% (Simon et al., 2012), the total number of NG2-glia
may not differ between TX-treated floxed (Sox10-CreER, Es-
co2fl/fl, GFP) and control animals (Sox10-CreER, Esco2wt/wt,
GFP) at 16 wpi because non-recombined NG2-glia are expected
to replace the Esco2-deficient NG2-glia that have been lost upon
entering mitosis (Figure S3D, lower panel). Indeed, at both 1 and
16 wpi time points, hypothalamic/ME NG2-glia coverage was
similar between floxed and control mice (Figures 2E–2H). How-
ever, while at 1 wpi the majority of NG2 cells were GFP+ in
both groups of mice (Figures 2E and 2F, white arrows), NG2
glia were mostly GFP negative at 16 wpi in the floxed mice (Fig-
ure 2H, yellow arrows; see also schematic in Figure S3D),
suggesting that ablation and replacement of Esco2-deficient
NG2-glia has occurred. Quantitative analysis confirmed the
depletion of GFP+ NG2-glia at 16 wpi with 41.56% ± 1.73%
and 73.12% ± 1.61% of hypothalamic NG2-glia expressing
GFP in floxed and control mice, respectively (p < 0.0002, un-
paired t test; n = 3; mean ±SEM), with no significant difference
at 1 wpi (75.75% ± 0.34% in floxed and 78.28% ± 2.09% in
control mice). Concomitantly, floxed mice significantly gained
weight over controls in the 16 weeks following TX treatment (Fig-
ures 2I and 2J), critically supporting our hypothesis that it is
proliferating NG2-glia that are required for body weight mainte-
nance. The body weight gain in TX-treated, floxed mice is
evidently more moderate than in AraC-treated animals, as would
be expected given both the lower ablation efficacy and faster
replacement rate in the Sox10-CreER, Esco2fl/fl, GFP model.
Central Mitotic Blockade Leads to Primary Leptin
Resistance in the ArcN
Toward a mechanistic understanding of NG2-glia ablation-
induced hyperphagia, we considered that obesity frequently
is associated with a desensitization of hypothalamic leptin
signaling (Myers et al., 2008). To assess whether leptin sensitivity
is affected by NG2-glia elimination, we examined leptin-induced
phosphorylation of hypothalamic signal transducer and activator
of transcription 3 (STAT3) in response to leptin. We again em-
ployed AraC-mediated elimination of NG2-glia due to its high

 ablation efficacy in the acute setting. STAT3 is an intracellular
downstream
component
of
the
leptin
receptor
signaling
pathway, and increased STAT3 phosphorylation following leptin
treatment indicates leptin receptor activation (Vaisse et al.,
1996). Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of leptin resulted in a
strong, nuclear pSTAT3 staining in the ArcN and other hypotha-
lamic feeding centers in control mice (Figure 3A), whereas
AraC-infused animals showed a markedly attenuated pSTAT3
response selectively in the ArcN (Figure 3B). Quantitative anal-
ysis of immunosignal intensity confirmed these results: leptin-
induced pSTAT3 in AraC-infused animals was significantly
reduced in the ArcN when compared to the ventromedial nu-
cleus (VMH) or to artificial CSF (aCSF)-infused control mice (Fig-
ures 3C and 3D). Western blot analysis further corroborated
these findings (Figures 3E–3H). The leptin-induced pSTAT3-spe-
cific signal was substantially reduced in ArcN protein extracts of
AraC-treated mice (Figures 3E and 3G), whereas the pSTAT3
signal in VMH/dorsomedial nucleus (DMH) extract did not differ
between groups (Figures 3F and 3H). This phenotype is reminis-
cent of diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, which also show selec-
tive loss of leptin responsiveness in the ArcN (Mu
¨ nzberg et al.,
2004), thought to be a consequence of the diet-induced increase
in fat mass (Frederich et al., 1995).
To determine if the AraC-induced leptin resistance is similarly
secondary to weight gain, we examined leptin-mediated pSTAT3
induction on day 6 of AraC infusion (Figure S4B), a time point
when the excess weight gain is small but already significant (Fig-
ure S4A). Even at this early time point, the pSTAT3 response was
highly blunted in the ArcN of AraC-treated mice (Figures S4C and
S4D). By contrast, body weight-matched mice that were fed a
high-calorie diet (HCD) until reaching similar weight gains (Fig-
ure S4A) showed only a mild attenuation of the ArcN pSTAT3
response to leptin (Figure S4E). Induction of STAT3 phosphory-
lation in HCD-fed animals was specific to i.p.-injected leptin, and
not due to the HCD per se (Figure S4F).
Collectively, these findings indicate that NG2-glia ablation-
induced leptin resistance is primary, i.e., it precedes the weight
gain, suggesting a causal link.

 Loss of Electrical Responsiveness to Leptin in ArcN
LepR Neurons
To further investigate the consequences of AraC treatment on ArcN
LepR neuron function, we examined the electrophysiological
properties of these neurons using reporter mice that express
the fluorescent protein tdTomato exclusively in LepR cells
(LepR-Cre 3 tdTomato mice). Whole-cell recordings in acute brain
slices revealed no differences in the basal electrical membrane
properties of tdTomato-expressing (Tom+) LepR neurons residing
in the ArcN between AraC- and vehicle-infused mice (Figures
S5A–S5M); thus, AraC treatment does not globally affect the electri-
cal membrane properties or responsiveness of ArcN LepR neurons.
When leptin was added to the slice perfusate, almost all tested
ArcN LepR neurons of aCSF-infused animals exhibited a marked
hyperpolarization, which was associated with a loss of sponta-
neous firing (Figures 4A, upper trace, 4C, and 4D). This finding
is consistent with the observation that GABAergic (including
NPY/AgRP-positive) LepR neurons are much more numerous
than glutamatergic (including POMC-positive) LepR neurons in
the ArcN (Vong et al., 2011) and that only the former are expected
to show hyperpolarizing responses to leptin (Cowley et al., 2001;
van den Top et al., 2004).
When we next recorded from Tom+ neurons in the ArcN of
AraC-infusedmice,mostneuronsremainedunresponsive(Figures
4A, lower trace, 4C, and 4D), with responsive neurons (2 of 9; Fig-
ure 4D) exhibiting only a relatively muted hyperpolarization. Leptin
responsiveness of Tom+ neurons of the VMH region, on the other
hand,remainedunaffectedbyAraCtreatment(Figures4Band4D).

 AraC treatment had neither an effect on total LepR cell
numbers in the ArcN (Figures 4E and 4F) nor on the number of
POMC-expressing cells (Figures 4G and 4H), which are known
mediators of the anorexigenic response to circulating leptin
(Balthasar et al., 2004; Cowley et al., 2001). Thus, the observed
weight gain is not simply due to a loss of neurons within the ArcN
energy balance circuitry or a global impairment of LepR neuronal
physiology, but rather due to a selective loss of leptin sensitivity
in ArcN LepR neurons.
Anorexigenic Signaling Downstream of the ArcN Is
Unaffected by Mitotic Blockade
If AraC-induced NG2-glia ablation indeed leads to a selective
loss of leptin sensing by the ArcN circuitry, then downstream
effector cells of energy balance signaling should retain normal
functionality. To test this, we i.p. injected mice with the melano-
cortin analog MTII, which lowers food intake by activating mela-
nocortin 4 receptor neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular
nucleus (PVN) (Marsh et al., 1999), thus mimicking the effect of
endogenous a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone released by
LepR-expressing POMC neurons in the ArcN (Morton et al.,
2014). AraC-treated, overweight mice responded to the MTII in-
jection with an acute reduction in food intake similarly to control
animals (Figures 4I and 4J), corroborating that energy balance
signaling downstream of the ArcN LepR neurons is not affected
by the mitotic blocker. On the other hand, as expected, leptin
treatment failed to lower food intake in AraC-treated mice (Fig-
ures 4I and 4J).
To further confirm that AraC induces primary leptin resistance,
we employed ob/ob mice, which genetically lack endogenous
leptin (Zhang et al., 1994). Despite their profound obesity, these
mice are leptin sensitive, as demonstrated by their strong
anorexigenic response to exogenous leptin (Pelleymounter
et al., 1995). If AraC infusion indeed leads to leptin resistance in-
dependent of circulating leptin levels, then mitotic blocker would
be expected to induce leptin resistance even in the complete
absence of endogenous leptin. To test this, ob/ob mice were
i.c.v. infused with AraC for 1 week, and on day 14 post-treatment
cessation the animals received a single i.p. injection of leptin. We
found leptin to be less effective in reducing overnight food intake
in AraC- over aCSF-infused ob/ob mice, while i.p. MTII injections
had a similar anorexigenic effect in both groups (Figures S5N and
S5O). Of note, AraC treatment per se did not result in an elevation
of the rate of body weight gain in ob/ob mice (Figure S5P), further
corroborating that AraC’s effect on energy balance relies solely
on the impairment of leptin sensing, which is already fully absent
in ob/ob mice.
Weight Gain Selectively Correlates with NG2-Glia
Elimination from the ME and Rivals that of Leptin
Signaling-Deficient Mice
In our search for the specific impairment causing the obese
phenotype in AraC-treated mice, we noted that a small fraction
of treated animals consistently failed to exhibit a gain in body
weight in comparison to controls (Figures 5A and 5B, males;
Figures S6A and S6B, females). When we then examined the
extent of NG2-glia ablation on post-surgery day 7, a time when
AraC-mediated cell ablation is still at its maximum and a gainer
phenotype is already discernible (Figure 5C), we invariably found
NG2-glia partially or fully retained in the ME in non-gainers,
while gainers consistently showed a complete loss of ME
NG2-glia (Figures 5D–5G). These data point to the ME as the crit-
ical site for AraC-dependent obesity induction. Notably, gainers
frequently showed peak gains greater than 5 g/week, reaching
body weights of up to 60 g at 8 weeks post-cannulation (Fig-
ure 5A), thereby doubling their pre-surgery body weights (also
Figures S6A and S6C), which together is very reminiscent of
weight gains and obesity levels seen in ob/ob or db/db mice
(Coleman, 1978). These data thus suggest that complete but
transient ablation of NG2-glia from the ME leads to an energy
balance dysregulation, which rivals that of mice genetically lack-
ing leptin or its receptor.
In this context it should be pointed out that the adult ME rep-
resents a particularly proliferative structure, exhibiting a 15-fold
greater density of BrdU-incorporating cells when compared to
the hypothalamus (Figures 5H and 5I). BrdU/NG2 co-labeling
furthermore revealed that most of these cells are NG2-glia (Fig-
ure S3C), which are also more proliferative (Figure 5J) and found
at much higher densities (Figure 5K) in the ME when compared to
the hypothalamus proper.
To further elucidate the role of the ME NG2-glia in energy bal-
ance regulation, we considered that the ME has been proposed
to mediate the anorexigenic effect of adipocyte-derived leptin
(Banks et al., 1996; Faouzi et al., 2007), which is thought to exit
the fenestrated portal capillary bed of the ME to activate LepR
signaling in ArcN neurons (Mu
¨ nzberg and Morrison, 2015). To
assess the anatomic basis of leptin sensing in the ME, we first in-
spected the ME territory for the presence of LepR neuronal pro-
cesses using LepR-Cre 3 GFP reporter mice. Immunostaining
against GFP revealed structures resembling fine processes,
which frequently exhibited bead-like morphologies that ap-
peared to traverse the ME predominantly dorsoventrally from
ArcN/third ventricle to the portal capillary bed (Figures 5L, 6A,
and 6B). The observed staining pattern is consistent with LepR
neurons sending processes into the ME toward the fenestrated
vessels
to
facilitate
circulating
leptin
sensing.
When
we
co-stained for NG2, we observed the GFP and NG2 signal in
close association, with NG2-glia processes appearing to enwrap
the LepR neurites (Figures 5M and 5N; Movie S1).
Mitotic Blocker Treatment Induces LepR Dendritic
Process Degeneration in the ME
Next we inspected the ME of LepR-Cre 3 GFP mice 1 week after
AraC cessation (Figures 6A–6D). To enhance the GFP signal in
LepR processes, mice were stereotaxically injected into the
ArcN region with the Cre-inducible AAV-Ef1a-Flex-ArchT-GFP
virus, which potently labels neuronal processes (Amilhon et al.,
2015). Compared to aCSF-infused controls (Figures 6A and
6B), which exhibit strong process-like GFP staining, the ME
of AraC-treated animals showed a profound reduction in
immuno-positive processes (Figures 6C and 6D). Instead, stain-
ing appeared punctate, with punctae showing a variety of sizes
and shapes (Figure 6D). Such a staining pattern is reminiscent
of neuronal processes undergoing degeneration/fragmenta-
tion (Kadkhodaei et al., 2013; Schaefer et al., 2007; Yun et al.,
2014), suggesting that AraC-induced NG2-glia ablation causes
the degradation of LepR processes in the ME. By contrast,
gross LepR process architecture within the ArcN proper was

 indistinguishable between aCSF- and AraC-treated mice (Fig-
ures 6E and 6F).
Histochemical determination of axonal versus dendritic iden-
tity of ArcN neuronal processes by immunodetection, using
markers such as neurofilament H or MAP2, was unsuccessful
in our hands, in line with previous attempts on POMC (Hentges,
2007) and GnRH neurons (Herde et al., 2013). We thus
resorted to immuno-electron microscopy (EM) to assess the

 ultrastructural nature of the LepR processes in the ME and to
further examine the degenerating effect of NG2-glia ablation
on the LepR neuropil. We again employed LepR-Cre 3 GFP
mice to enable identification of LepR processes by immuno-gold
labeling against GFP (Figures 6G–6N). In aCSF-infused, LepR-
Cre 3 GFP mice, silver-enhanced gold particles (arrowheads,
Figures 6H and 6J) were found associated with profiles identified
as dendrites due to the presence of postsynaptic densities
(arrows, Figures 6H, 6J, and S6D–S6F), an irregular shape, and
dendritic spine-like protrusions (Figures 6J, S6D, and S6E). By
contrast, immuno-positive myelinated profiles or presynaptic
formations were never detected, arguing against an axonal na-
ture for the ME LepR processes. The dendritic character of the
immuno-positive structures is consistent with a sensing function
for the LepR processes in the ME, and it is in line with a previous
finding attributing LepR expression to somato-dendritic, but not
axonal, compartments of POMC and AgRP neurons (Ha et al.,
2013). When we next inspected LepR-Cre 3 GFP mice that
had gained weight in response to AraC infusion, we found
many of the immuno-labeled dendritic profiles in the ME of
AraC-treated animals to show signs of advanced degeneration,
such as an electron-lucent cytoplasm, membrane disintegration,
dark debris, and mitochondria with swollen distended cristae or
holes (Figures 6K–6O). Synapses could still be observed on
some of such profiles (Figure 6L, arrow), consistent with a de-
layed synapse loss during dendritic degeneration, as has been
reported previously (Hall et al., 2000).
X-Irradiation Targeted at the ME Leads to NG2-Glia/
LepR-Dendrite Loss and Weight Gain
To further confirm that mitotic blockade specifically in the ME
causes a gain in body weight, we employed cranial X-irradiation,
which has been used successfully to ablate NG2-glia in various
brain regions (Irvine and Blakemore, 2007). Of note, there is a
strong association between obesity risk and cranial X-irradiation
therapy in cancer survivors. To assess the effect of X-irradiation
on the ME in particular, we used lead shielding to restrict radia-
tion exposure to the mediobasal hypothalamus/ME region. To
this end, the rodent skull was surgically exposed and stereotax-
ically positioned so that the mediobasal hypothalamus/ME re-
gion was centered underneath a 2-mm bore in the lead shield
(Figure 7A). Immunolabeling against the phosphorylated H2A
histone family member X (H2AX), an indicator for ionizing radia-
tion exposure (Rogakou et al., 1998), 1 hr after exposure to a sin-
gle X-irradiation dose led to strong staining of a tissue column
centered on the ME (Figures S7A–S7C), demonstrating the
effectiveness of the radiation beam targeting. We next tested
whether X-irradiation treatment indeed leads to NG2-glia abla-
tion. To mark NG2-glia, we employed NG2-CreER 3 tdTomato
mice, which first received TX to activate Tom expression selec-
tively in NG2 cells. The mice were then X-irradiated in three ses-
sions before receiving i.p. BrdU injections on the 3 consecutive
days prior to perfusion (Figure 7B). Immunodetection of BrdU
at 14 days post-irradiation revealed that the number of ME
dividing cells in general, and proliferating NG2-glia in particular,
was augmented over sham-treated mice (Figures 7C–7F).
This result mirrors the findings of our previous AraC ablation
experiments (Robins et al., 2013c), which also resulted in a net
increase of BrdU+NG2+ cells post-treatment due to the replen-
ishment of lost NG2-glia by proliferating neighboring NG2
cells. By contrast, acutely after X-irradiation treatment (3 days
following the last irradiation dose), the number of NG2-glia in
the ME was reduced when compared to sham-irradiated animals
(Figures S7D and S7E).
Critically, we found that X-irradiation resulted in a significant
increase in body weight compared to sham-irradiated controls
in both males and females (Figures 7G and S7F), and this gain
appears to be exclusively due to an increase in fat mass (Fig-
ure S7G). We next inspected the ME from X-irradiated mice,
which had the LepR-Cre 3 GFP genotype, for the presence of
GFP. Mice were again stereotaxically injected with AAV-Ef1a-
Flex-ArchT-GFP into the ArcN to enhance GFP signal, 12 days
prior to sacrifice. In line with our observations of AraC-treated
LepR-Cre 3 GFP mice (see Figure 6), we detected a reduction
in GFP+ process-like structures in the ME of X-irradiated, over-
weight mice versus mock-treated controls (Figures S7H–S7M).
To quantitatively assess the extent of the process structure
loss, we processed the GFP signal from individual ME images
using Squassh (Rizk et al., 2014), which enables automated
detection of fluorescently labeled objects (Figures S7N–S7S).
While the mean object fluorescence intensity was indifferent
between groups (Figure S7T), the total object surface area was
decreased in the ME of irradiated mice (Figure S7U). Further-
more, even though the total number of detected objects was
equivalent, the number of large objects was reduced in the ME
upon irradiation (Figure S7V). This result is consistent with induc-
tion of LepR process fragmentation corresponding to our find-
ings with AraC-treated mice.
DISCUSSION
Our data provide strong evidence that LepR neuronal processes,
which reside in the ME and show hallmarks of dendrites (Figures
S6D–S6F), are key to body weight control and that NG2-glia play
a critical role in preserving these processes (see model, Fig-
ure 7H). We observed LepR dendritic degeneration shortly after
mitotic blockade (1 week, Figures 6A–6D) but also at later time
points post-AraC infusion or X-irradiation (6 weeks, Figures
6G–6O; 24 weeks, Figures S7H–S7V), suggesting that the
LepR process impairment induced by short-term NG2-glia elim-
ination is permanent. Of note, infusing AraC at a substantially
lower dose of 40 mg/day (versus 120 mg/day in this study) does
not lead to a weight gain (Borg et al., 2014; Kokoeva et al.,
2005). We propose that this is due to low concentrations of
AraC being insufficient to breach the tanycyte barrier, which is
thought to isolate the ME proper from the adjacent ArcN tissue
(Rodrı
´guez et al., 2010).
The NG2-glia conceivably exert their role in process preserva-
tion by physically protecting the dendrites from the likely
deleterious environment of the ME, e.g., exposure to certain
blood-born substances that may freely diffuse into the ME inter-
stitial space through the fenestrations of the ME capillaries.
Alternatively or additionally, NG2-glia may provide trophic or
structural support to the LepR neurites of the ME.
Interestingly, a direct involvement of glia in the maintenance of
sensory dendrite integrity has been demonstrated recently for
Caenorhabditis elegans (Bacaj et al., 2008). Here ablation of
the sheath glia cell that enwraps the dendritic sensing portion
806
Cell Metabolism 23, 797–810, May 10, 2016
 of the chemosensory neurons in the amphid, the largest nema-
tode sensing organ, triggers the collapse of these specialized
process endings and leads to a severe blunting of the chemo-
tactic response. Notably, glia ablation did not affect viability of
these primary sensory neurons per se.
While the AraC infusion, X-irradiation, and Esco2 disruption
experiments together point to the loss of ME NG2-glia as the
root cause of the observed weight gain, all three treatments
also have in common a capacity to cause cell death in the ME.
It could, therefore, be alternatively concluded that cell death in
general, but not the particular demise of NG2-glia, leads to
weight gain. If this were indeed the case, then ablation of micro-
glia from the ME should have similar consequences, as their den-
sity seems to be comparable to that of NG2-glia in the ME (see
Figures 2A, 2B, S3A, and S3B). However, total ablation of micro-
glia from the brain parenchyma did not affect body weights,
ruling out cell death per se as a trigger of the energy balance
phenotype. Notably, this finding also indicates that microglia
ablation does not play an important role, if any, in energy bal-
ance, at least under conditions of regular chow feeding in adult
animals.
While AraC treatment led to overeating and a gain in body
weight within a few days of infusion onset, the weight gain
following X-irradiation focused on the ME area was much more

(H) Model of NG2-glia ablation-induced leptin resistance. Left: LepR neurons (green) extend dendritic projections past the barrier established by tanycyte
processes (gray), which seal off the ArcN proper from the ME. We propose that these LepR dendrites express leptin receptors (blue) and terminate near or at
fenestrated vessels (brown) of the portal capillary bed in order to sense circulating leptin (blue dots), which exits the blood vessels by passive diffusion. Right:
Upon ME NG2-glia (red) ablation, LepR processes degenerate and the respective neurons lose their ability to sense leptin. This primary leptin resistance leads to
overeating and obesity because other possible leptin-sensing pathways cannot compensate for the loss.

 delayed and also milder. This discrepancy is, however, consis-
tent with the finding that X-irradiation, in contrast to AraC
treatment, leads only to a partial elimination of NG2-glia in the
diencephalon, which peaks at �2–4 weeks post-radiation treat-
ment (Irvine and Blakemore, 2007). The incomplete ablation in
case of the genetic Esco2 disruption-based model may similarly
explain its milder body weight phenotype. Irrespective of these
differences, all ablation approaches lead to a weight gain over
controls, strongly supporting a role for ME NG2-glia in energy
balance maintenance.
Detection of circulating leptin for energy balance control pre-
viously has been associated with the ME (Faouzi et al., 2007;
Myers, 2013); however, it also has been proposed that leptin
sensing requires active, saturable transport across non-fenes-
trated brain capillaries (Banks et al., 1996; Golden et al., 1997)
or uptake into the CSF by internalization of the short LepR iso-
form (LepRa) in the choroid plexus (Friedman, 1998). Since
AraC-treated mice show an obesity phenotype that rivals that
seen in mice lacking leptin or its receptor globally (Chen et al.,
1996; Zhang et al., 1994), we conclude that the ME processes
of LepR neurons are likely the central mediators of leptin’s action
on energy balance.
We do not yet know the location of the perikarya from which
the ME LepR dendrites emanate. However, the selective lack
of leptin responsiveness in the ArcN of AraC-treated gainers sug-
gests that the leptin-sensing ME dendrites belong to ArcN neu-
rons. Interestingly, an obesity phenotype resembling that of
db/db or ob/ob mice also has been reported for mice that selec-
tively lack LepR throughout the hypothalamus, including the
ArcN (Ring and Zeltser, 2010), or exclusively in GABAergic neu-
rons (Vong et al., 2011). By contrast, mice that lack LepR only in
POMC neurons (Balthasar et al., 2004) or in both AgRP/NPY and
POMC neurons (van de Wall et al., 2008) are only mildly over-
weight, although both of these ArcN neuronal populations are
considered key elements of the central energy balance circuitry
(Morton et al., 2014; Williams and Elmquist, 2012). The most
parsimonious conclusion from these findings would then be
that the ME-projecting, primary leptin-sensing neurons are likely
to be GABAergic neurons residing in the ArcN, which may
include AgRP/NPY neurons.
Recently, tanycytes have been implicated in leptin sensing.
Leptin has been reported to be transported from the ME to the
hypothalamic CSF by these specialized glia (Balland et al.,
2014), which line the basal third ventricle in the mediobasal hy-
pothalamic region with their processes contacting the ME portal
capillary bed (Figure 7H). The authors reported that tanycytic
processes take up leptin in the ME and then transport it to the
ArcN energy balance circuits. A functional link to energy balance
control was, however, not provided nor was leptin receptor
expression demonstrated in tanycytes. Third-ventricular tany-
cytes also have been proposed to act as postnatal stem cells
with the capacity for generating neurons (Lee et al., 2012; Robins
et al., 2013a), and Lee et al. (2012) further implicated these cells
in energy balance regulation. The authors reported that X-irradi-
ation focused onto the ME caused a reduction in body weight
and increased energy expenditure in mice, a result that is con-
trary to our findings. This discrepancy may be due to differences
in beam characteristics or irradiation protocol and, thus, effec-
tive radiation dose at the target side.
Irradiation-associated, excessive weight gain has been spe-
cifically reported for acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors
who received cranial X-irradiation as prophylaxis against tumor
recurrence (Iughetti et al., 2012). Weight gain was observed to
commence during radiation treatment and obese phenotypes
were sustained well beyond treatment termination. Thus, radia-
tion therapy appears to permanently alter energy balance in
these cancer survivors (Iughetti et al., 2012; Wilson et al.,
2015). Of particular note, when focused radiation was employed
to target distinct tumor-affected brain regions, weight gain was
reported to be more substantial if the hypothalamus was within
the radiation field (Lustig, 2002). Our findings now provide a po-
tential mechanistic basis for this effect, suggesting that transient
ablation of ME NG2-glia causes the weight gain.
Our data demonstrate that ME NG2-glia exhibit an exception-
ally high degree of turnover when compared to the hypothalamic
parenchyma and perhaps most other brain sites. They are five
times denser and 3.5 times more mitotically active than else-
where in the hypothalamus. This may explain why NG2-glia abla-
tion has such dramatic consequences on energy balance regu-
lation, but not other ME-independent hypothalamic functions.
The high ME NG2-glia turnover might be owing to the fact that
the ME represents an extra-brain structure providing a particu-
larly challenging environment for NG2-glia and/or neuropil.
These observations lend support to the idea that the ME LepR
neurite/NG2-glia ensemble represents an Achilles’ heel of en-
ergy balance regulation, whose impairment can permanently
and profoundly alter body weight set levels.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Mice were housed under a 12-hr light:12-hr dark cycle with lights on at 7 a.m.,
and experiments were performed on 8- to 12-week-old mice of either sex, if
not otherwise noted. All animal procedures were carried out in accordance
with the recommendations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC),
and they have been approved by the McGill University Animal Care
Committee.
Diets
Mice were fed regular chow (2018s, Harlan Laboratories) or high-calorie
chow (D12492, Research Diets) for obesity induction. To ablate microglia
from the brain parenchyma, mice were fed a chow diet supplemented with
the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 (290 mg/kg, Plexikkon).
AraC Treatment and Weight Gain Phenotype Classification
AraC (Sigma) was administered via osmotic minipumps (flow rate 0.5 mL/hr,
7-day pumps, Alzet) as previously described (Robins et al., 2013c). AraC
was infused in aCSF at a dose of 120 mg/day while control mice received
aCSF alone. Mice were anesthetized with a ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine
(10 mg/kg) cocktail (KX) in preparation for surgery. They were stereotaxically
(Kopf Instruments) implanted with a steel cannula (328OPM/Spc, Plastics
One) into the right lateral ventricle (anteroposterior �0.3 mm, lateral +1.0 mm
to bregma, and dorsoventral �2.6 mm below skull). Alternatively, cannulae
were lowered into the third (stereotaxic coordinates �1.7 mm anteroposterior,
0 mm lateral, and �5.94 mm dorsoventral) or fourth (stereotaxic coordinates
�6.0 mm anteroposterior, 0 mm lateral, and �4.1 mm dorsoventral) ventricular
spaces. The tubing (Plastics One, inner diameter 0.69 mm) connecting the
pump to the cannula was cut to a length of 67 mm and filled with aCSF. This
allowed for a recovery period of 48 hr following surgery, during which mice
received only aCSF. Based on retrospective analysis on AraC-treated mice
that were monitored long term, body weight phenotypes were determined
as follows for day 7 post-cannulation surgery: mice that had gained more
808
Cell Metabolism 23, 797–810, May 10, 2016
 than two SDs above the mean body weight of vehicle-infused controls were
considered gainers, whereas mice that had gained less than one SD above
the mean were considered non-gainers.
X-Irradiation of the Hypothalamus/ME Region
Mice were stereotaxically positioned to align the ME/mediobasal hypothala-
mus with the 2-mm bore drilled through the custom-made lead shield covering
the animal’s skull and body. The shielded mouse was then placed into an
X-irradiator (Rad Source 2000 Biological Research Irradiator), and mice were
irradiated in three sessions receiving a total of 45 or 60 Gy.
Leptin/MTII Treatment
Leptin (National Hormone and Peptide Program) or MTII (Bachem) was dis-
solved in 13 PBS. For assessing pSTAT3 induction, fasted mice were given
a single i.p. injection 1 hr prior to perfusion with a leptin dose of 7.5 mg/g
body weight. For assessing the effect of exogenous leptin and MTII on over-
night food intake, mice were i.p. injected with leptin (2.5 mg/g body weight)
or MTII (4 mg/g body weight) 1 hr before lights off, and subsequent food intake
was measured 16 hr later (3 hr after lights on).
Statistical Analysis
Group data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was calcu-
lated using paired or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test, except for the
Squaash3C analysis, where a two-way ANOVA was applied. If not otherwise
noted, statistical significance was indicated as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
and ***p < 0.001; ns, non-significant.
