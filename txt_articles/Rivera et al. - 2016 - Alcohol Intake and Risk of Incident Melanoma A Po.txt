Abstract
Background: Alcohol consumption is associated with increas-
ed risk of numerous cancers, but existing evidence for an asso-
ciation with melanoma is equivocal. No study has evaluated the
association with different anatomic locations of melanoma.
Methods: We used data from three large prospective cohort
studies to investigate whether alcohol intake was associated with
risk of melanoma. Alcohol intake was assessed repeatedly by
food-frequency questionnaires. A Cox proportional hazards mod-
el was used to calculate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs).
Results: A total of 1,374 cases of invasive melanoma were
documented during 3,855,706 person-years of follow-up.
There was an association between higher alcohol intake and
incidence of invasive melanoma (pooled multivariate HR
1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00–1.29] per drink/day;
Ptrend ¼ 0.04). Among alcoholic beverages, white wine con-
sumption was associated with an increased risk of melanoma
(pooled multivariate HR 1.13 [95% CI, 1.04–1.24] per drink/
day; Ptrend <0.01) after adjusting for other alcoholic beverages.
The association between alcohol consumption and melanoma
risk was stronger for melanoma in relatively UV-spared sites
(trunk) versus more UV-exposed sites (head, neck, or extrem-
ities). Compared with nondrinkers, the pooled multivariate-
adjusted HRs for �20 g/day of alcohol were 1.02 (95% CI,
0.64–1.62; Ptrend ¼ 0.25) for melanomas of the head, neck, and
extremities and 1.73 (95% CI, 1.25–2.38; Ptrend ¼ 0.02) for
melanomas of the trunk.
Conclusions: Alcohol intake was associated with a modest
increase in the risk of melanoma, particularly in UV-protected
sites.
Impact: These findings further support American Cancer
Society Guidelines for Cancer Prevention to limit alcohol intake.

Introduction
Melanoma incidence has been rising steadily since the 1970s
(1–12), during which time Americans' average consumption of
alcoholic beverages has increased by 71 kilocalories per person
per day (13). The concurrence of these trends tentatively
suggests that they may be related, and some investigators have
proposed that alcohol consumption might intensify sunburn
severity and thereby increase the risk of melanoma (14, 15).
Known predictors of melanoma risk include a personal or
family history of skin cancer, presence of numerous or atypical
moles, high sun sensitivity (sunburning easily, difficulty tan-
ning, natural red or blond hair color), immunosuppression,
and intermittent ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. With
the exception of UVR exposure, most of these are nonmodi-
fiable host factors, which would be unlikely to drive the rising
incidence of melanoma.
Alcohol consumption is a modifiable lifestyle factor asso-
ciated with cancers of the aerodigestive tract, liver, pancreas,
colon, rectum, and breast (16–20). Approximately 3.6% of
cancers worldwide have been attributed to alcohol use
(21, 22). Alcohol causes carcinogenesis via metabolism of
ethanol into acetaldehyde, a Group I human carcinogen that
readily forms Schiff-base adducts with DNA and cellular
proteins (23–25). These adducts cause both point mutations
and deleterious DNA–protein and DNA–DNA crosslinks. In
addition to the endogenous conversion of ethanol into acet-
aldehyde, some alcoholic beverages contain carcinogenic
levels of preexisting acetaldehyde (26–29). Such beverages
may confer greater risk than others, even at similar levels of
ethanol consumption.
Experimental studies in animals suggest that the clinical
course of melanoma may be more aggressive in the presence
of ethanol (30–32). This has never been demonstrated in
humans, and epidemiologic evidence for an association
between alcohol consumption and melanoma has been
equivocal
(22,
33–44).

Downloaded from 
 (14 case–control and 2 cohort) with 6,251 cases of melano-
ma, found that regular alcohol consumption was associated
with a 20% [pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.20; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.06–1.37] elevated risk of melanoma compared
with nondrinkers/occasional drinkers (45). The HRs were
1.10 (95% CI, 0.96–1.26) for drinkers consuming �1 drink
per day and 1.18 (95% CI, 1.01–1.40) for those consuming
�1 drink per day, suggesting a dose–response relationship.
These data largely relied on case–control studies, although the
positive association was similar in cohort studies. Further-
more, 6 of the studies did not adjust for UVR exposure
(pooled HR 1.27; 95% CI, 1.20–1.35 among these studies),
and among the 10 studies that adjusted for UVR exposure, the
results were not statistically significant (pooled HR 1.15; 95%
CI, 0.94–1.41). A pooled analysis of 8 case–control studies,
which somewhat overlapped with the meta-analysis, reported
a positive association between alcohol consumption and
melanoma (46). Therefore, prospective data on alcohol intake
and melanoma are limited with no evaluation of the associ-
ation by body location of melanoma.
We therefore investigated the association between alcohol
consumption and melanoma risk using prospective data from
three large cohort studies.
Materials and Methods
Study population
A total of 210,252 participants from the United States were
followed for a mean of 18.3 years (3,855,706 person-years).
Details of each cohort are presented in Supplementary Table
S1. Briefly, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) started in 1976 with
121,700 married, female registered nurses aged 30–55 years. The
Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) began in 1989 with 116,671
female nurses ages 25–42 years. The Health Professionals Follow-
Up Study (HPFS) began in 1986 with 51,529 men in health
professions. Participants receive biennial questionnaires, and the
response rate in each follow-up cycle typically exceeds 90%.
Return of the questionnaires was considered as informed consent
in the studies. This study was approved by the Human Research
Committee at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard
School of Public Health (Boston, MA).
Assessment of alcohol intake
Semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were
administered almost every four years from 1984 to 2006 in the
NHS, from 1991 to 2007 in the NHS II, and from 1986 to 2006
in the HPFS. Participants were asked: "For each food listed, how
often on average have you used the amount specified during
the past year?" Five questions pertained to alcoholic beverages
(regular beer, light beer, red wine, white wine, and liquor).
Intake was reported in nine categories (number of drinks): 0 or
�1 per month, 1–3 per month, 1 per week, 2–4 per week, 5–
6 per week, 1 per day, 2–3 per day, 4–5 per day, and 6þ per day.
Responses were coded as 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5.5, 7, 17.5, 31.5, and
49 drinks per week, respectively. Beverage-specific consump-
tion was calculated as coded above for red wine, white wine,
liquor, and beer (combined light and non-light beer). For other
analyses, the amount of alcohol in grams was estimated for
each beverage (12.8 g for a beer, 11 g for a glass of wine, and
14 g for a shot of liquor). Total alcohol intake was computed as
the sum from these sources. Because of the paucity of parti-
cipants in higher intake categories, several higher consumption
categories were combined for analysis. To reduce within-person
variation and to better estimate long-term intake by taking
advantage of multiple dietary assessments during follow-up in
each study, we used the cumulative average intake of alcohol as
reported on all available questionnaires up to the start of each
2-year follow-up interval. For example, 1991 alcohol intake was
used for the 1991–1995 follow-up periods, the average of 1991
and 1995 intake was used for the 1995 to 1999 follow-up
periods, and the average of all three intakes (1991, 1995, and
1999) was used for the 1999–2003 follow-up periods to
maintain a strictly prospective analysis in NHSII. HRs "per
drink" in the total alcohol intake analyses are reported for a
standard drink containing 12.8 g of alcohol (median amount of
alcohol in one drink of beer, wine, or liquor). The reliability of
this questionnaire for alcohol intake has been previously
documented (47). To evaluate the validity of the reported
alcohol consumption measured by the FFQ, comprehensive
diet records and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels
were obtained from a subsample of participants in the NHS and
HPFS. Mean daily intake of alcohol as assessed by FFQs and
diet records were very similar (Spearman correlation coefficient
of 0.90 in women and 0.86 in men). Moreover, the difference in
plasma
HDL
for
men
reporting

alcohol
intake
versus drinkers reporting 39 g/day of alcohol intake on the
FFQ was 11.8 mg/dL, a magnitude similar to that determined
from the short-term intervention studies of alcohol.
Assessment of covariates
Participants reported their date of birth, height, current weight,
smoking history, physical activity, caffeine intake (48), family
history of melanoma, tanning ability, lifetime number of severe
sunburns, number of moles on forearms, hair color at age 18, and
place of residence on the biennial mailed questionnaires. Quin-
tiles of metabolic equivalents were calculated from questions
about physical activity. BMI was calculated from reported weight
and height. Age was calculated from reported date of birth.
Average annual UVB flux, a composite measure of mean UVB
radiation level based on latitude, altitude, and cloud cover, was
estimated for all participants according to state of residence. The
accuracy of self-reported anthropometric measures was previous-
ly validated among 140 NHS participants. Self-reported and
measured weights were highly correlated (Pearson r ¼ 0.97;
ref. 49).
Assessment of melanoma and melanoma in situ
Cases were ascertained from participants' responses to a
question on physician-diagnosed melanoma on the biennial
questionnaires. With their permission, medical records of par-
ticipants' who reported a diagnosis of melanoma were reviewed
by physicians to confirm the diagnosis and to record the
anatomic site affected. Only incident cases of cutaneous mel-
anoma that were confirmed via pathology record review were
included.
Statistical analyses
Participants were excluded at baseline if they reported a per-
sonal history of cancer, including non-melanoma skin cancer, to
avoid ascertainment bias due to closer physician follow-up
of cancer patients. Participants who reported non-white race/
ethnicity were also excluded, as there were too few non-white

 participants from which to draw statistically valid conclusions.
After application of exclusion criteria, 73,545 participants in the
NHS, 88,380 in the NHS II, and 48,327 in the HPFS were
included. Person-years of follow-up for each participant were
calculated from return of the baseline questionnaire (1984 for
NHS, 1991 for NHS II, and 1986 for HPFS) to the date of
melanoma diagnosis, death, or the end of follow-up (June
2012 for NHS, June 2011 for NHS II, and January 2012 for HPFS),
whichever came first.
We used a Cox proportional hazards model updated by cal-
endar time at 2-year intervals to estimate age-adjusted and mul-
tivariate-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs. Covariates were updated
during each follow-up cycle, if available. Beverage-specific anal-
yses were additionally adjusted for total alcohol intake. To cal-
culate the Ptrend, participants were assigned the median value of
their category of alcohol consumption, and this variable was used
as a continuous variable in the study-specific regression models.
To assess for effect modification, we stratified research subjects by
the variable of interest (age, smoking history, caffeine intake,
physical activity, hair color, BMI, anatomic site) and calculated
interaction terms. Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis by
excluding cases of lentigo maligna melanoma, a melanoma
subtype that is particularly UVR-dependent (50). We used a
meta-analytic approach drawing on data from all three cohorts
to obtain pooled HRs for all participants. We tested the hetero-
geneity among studies using the Q statistic and estimated the
overall association from random effects models (weighted pro-
portionately to the inverse of the sum of the study-specific
variance plus the common variance between studies) or fixed
effects models (weighted proportionately to the inverse of the
study-specific variance).
All statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Anal-
ysis System software (SAS, version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
All statistical tests were two tailed, and the significance level
was set at P < 0.05.
Results
We identified a total of 1,374 cases of incident invasive mel-
anoma (490 in the NHS, 391 in the NHS II, and 493 in the HPFS).
Cases of incident melanoma in situ totaled 835 (324 in the NHS,
289 in the NHS II, and 222 in the HPFS).
Table 1 shows characteristics of the study population by
alcohol intake at baseline, while Supplementary Tables S1 and
S2 present basic cohort information and drinking patterns by
cohort, respectively. Participants with higher alcohol intake
were more likely to smoke and to consume caffeine, consistent
with known behavioral patterns relating the consumption of
alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine (51). Higher alcohol consump-
tion was also associated with slightly greater physical activity
and a higher proportion of participants with red/blond hair
color. Among women, alcohol use was associated with a
greater fraction of participants reporting 6þ lifetime severe
sunburns. Other factors showed no association with alcohol
consumption.
Comparing cohorts, women in the NHS reported drinking
more caffeine, getting less physical activity, and smoking more
than other participants. Women in the NHS II were more likely to
have a family history ofmelanoma and more likely tohave natural
red or blond hair. They were also younger and had less extensive
smoking histories than other participants. Conversely, men in the
HPFS were older and more likely to have experienced 6þ blis-
tering sunburns in their lifetime.
Table 2 shows the HRs for the association between alcohol
intake and invasive melanoma. Significant associations were
found in the NHS II (Ptrend ¼ 0.01) and in the pooled analysis
of the three cohorts (HR 1.14 per drink per day; 95% CI, 1.00–
1.29, Ptrend ¼ 0.04) after adjusting for multiple covariates. The
NHS and HPFS cohorts showed tendencies toward elevated risk
of invasive melanoma associated with alcohol use, but those
results did not reach statistical significance. For the heaviest
drinkers (�20 g of ethanol per day), the pooled multivariate-
adjusted HR was 1.23 (95% CI, 0.96–1.59) compared with
nondrinkers (Pheterogeneity by study ¼ 0.26). We also conducted
a combined analysis of the three cohort studies and found that
alcohol intake was similarly positively associated with mela-
noma risk. Compared with nondrinkers, the multivariate HRs
for increasing intake of alcohol (0.1–4.9, 5–9.9, 10–19.9, 20þ
g/day) were 1.14 (95% CI, 0.99–1.31), 1.02 (95% CI, 0.84–
1.23), 1.21 (95% CI, 1.02–1.44), and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.02–
1.51; Fig. 1).
Supplementary Table S3 displays the equivalent data for mel-
anoma in situ. After adjusting for covariates, higher alcohol
consumption was positively associated with risk of melanoma
in situ in the NHS (Ptrend < 0.01), the NHS II (Ptrend < 0.01), and
the pooled analysis (HR 1.46 per drink/day, 95% CI, 1.24–1.72,
Ptrend < 0.0001). There was no association in the men's cohort
(HPFS). For the heaviest drinkers (�20 g of ethanol per day), the
pooled multivariate-adjusted HR was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.12–2.22)
compared with nondrinkers.
Table 3 shows HRs for the association between beer, red wine,
white wine, and liquor with incident invasive melanoma after
adjusting for melanoma risk factors and alcoholic beverages simul-
taneously. White wine consumption was associated with melano-
ma risk in the HPFS (Ptrend ¼ 0.02) and pooled analyses (HR 1.13,
95% CI, 1.04–1.24, Ptrend < 0.01, Pheterogeneity by study ¼ 0.63), but
not in the NHS or NHS II. Supplementary Table S4 shows the
same type of beverage-specific analysis with incidence of melano-
ma in situ as the outcome of interest. White wine consumption
was associated with melanoma in situ in the NHS (Ptrend ¼ 0.003)
and NHS II (Ptrend ¼ 0.03), and in the pooled analysis (HR: 1.18,
95% CI, 1.03–1.35, Ptrend ¼ 0.02), but not in the HPFS. No asso-
ciations were found between beer, red wine, or liquor and inci-
dence of either invasive melanoma or melanoma in situ.
The associations were similar in stratified analyses by age,
BMI, smoking history, physical activity, natural hair color, mole
count, and caffeine intake (data not shown). When we evalu-
ated alcohol intake in relation to anatomic site of tumor,
melanomas of the head, neck, and extremities were not asso-
ciated with alcohol intake in the pooled analysis, while mel-
anomas of the trunk were associated with consumption of
alcohol (Ptrend ¼ 0.02; Table 4). Compared with nondrinkers,
the pooled multivariate-adjusted HRs for �20 g/day of alcohol
were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.64–1.62; Ptrend ¼ 0.25) for melanomas of
the head, neck, and extremities and 1.73 (95% CI, 1.25–2.38;
Ptrend ¼ 0.02) for melanomas of the trunk.
Although our multivariate-adjusted analyses included sev-
eral measures of UVR exposure, an additional sensitivity
analysis was performed to assess for residual confounding
by UVR exposure. In this sensitivity analysis, there was no
material change when lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM)
cases (n ¼ 5) were excluded (data not shown).

 Discussion
Our data demonstrate that alcohol consumption is asso-
ciated with modest increased risk of melanoma. Among alco-
holic beverages, white wine consumption was associated with
increased risk of melanoma independent of other alcoholic
beverages. The positive association between alcohol consump-
tion and melanoma risk was stronger for melanoma in rela-
tively UV-spared sites (trunk) than relatively UV-exposed sites
(head, neck, or extremities).
Alcohol in general causes carcinogenesis via acetaldehyde by
creating DNA adducts (23–25). It is unclear whether the same
mechanism operates in skin carcinogenesis. Alcohol may also
act as a photosensitizer and the combination of UV radiation
and alcohol consumption may potentiate the skin carcinogen-
esis (15). However, the stronger association with melanoma on
UV-spared sites compared with UV-exposed sites argues against
this mechanism.
The association between alcohol consumption and risk of
melanoma in situ was stronger in women than in men, while the
association with invasive melanoma was only significant in the
NHS II. Men have a greater average volume of distribution and
greater gastric metabolism of alcohol. Consequently, men gen-
erate lower blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde
than women after imbibing equivalent doses of alcohol
(52–54). Therefore, the effective dose of alcohol and acetalde-
hyde reaching the melanocytes would be higher in women
(on average) than in men at the same level of alcohol consump-
tion. As it is the effective dose reaching the melanocytes that
affects the probability of developing melanoma, it is reasonable
that the risk per drink per day is higher for women. Meanwhile,
in women, the association was stronger in NHS II, which was

 based on younger women with alcohol intake assessed earlier
in life than in NHS. It may suggest that alcohol intake in earlier
life might be more relevant to melanoma risk.
Although we hypothesized that other lifestyle factors might
modulate how alcohol use affects the risk of cancer (55), there
was no evidence that age, smoking history, caffeine intake,
physical activity, hair color, mole count, or BMI modified the
association between alcohol intake and melanoma when results
were stratified by those variables. However, heavier drinkers
were more likely to be smokers, had higher caffeine intake, had
a higher number of lifetime severe sunburns, and were more
physically active than those who consumed less alcohol.
Although each of these variables was included in the regression
model as a covariate in the calculation of adjusted HRs, the
possibility of residual confounding remains. In addition, alco-
hol drinking pattern (e.g., binge drinking compared with con-
suming alcohol with a meal) was not evaluated, and may be an
important modifier of the effect of alcohol consumption on
melanoma.
When alcohol intake was investigated in relation to ana-
tomic site of melanoma, we found that alcohol intake had a far
greater effect on melanoma risk at relatively UV-spared sites
such as the trunk compared with highly UV-exposed sites such
as the head, neck, or extremities. Because the literature suggests
that etiologies of melanoma differ by anatomic site (56), we
posit that alcohol consumption may affect those etiologic
pathways differently. Alcohol's carcinogenic effect may be
more relevant to melanomas of relatively UV-spared sites. A
pooled analysis of 8 case–control studies also evaluated the
effect of alcohol by anatomic site of melanoma. The positive
association between alcohol intake and melanoma was slightly
stronger with truncal melanomas than melanomas of other
body site (46).
Among alcoholic beverages, we believe that some types are
carcinogenic beyond what would be explained by ethanol
content alone (27, 28). We attribute this effect to high levels
of pre-existing acetaldehyde in those beverages, which adds to
the carcinogenicity of endogenously generated acetaldehyde.
In some cases, the pre-existing acetaldehyde alone is above the
carcinogenic level (26, 27). To isolate the effects of pre-existing
acetaldehyde and other non-ethanol components of alcoholic
beverages, we analyzed each alcoholic beverage (white wine,
red wine, beer, and liquor) after adjusting for other alcoholic
beverages simultaneously. White wine was the only beverage

 independently associated with risk of melanoma. This is in
accordance with research showing that wine has far higher
levels of pre-existing acetaldehyde than beer or spirits (26,
27). Our findings also support those of a previous study by
Kubo and colleagues, in which preference for white wine was
associated with increased risk of melanoma and non-melano-
ma skin cancer in the Women's Health Initiative, a cohort of
postmenopausal women (57). A pooled analysis of 8 case–
control studies also found that among alcoholic beverages,
wine was most strongly associated with melanoma risk
(OR ¼ 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8 for ever consumption vs. never;
ref. 46). Red versus white wine was not evaluated separately.
Red and white wines have similar pre-existing acetaldehyde
content, but antioxidants in red wine may offset these risks;
experiments show that blood acetaldehyde content and cyto-
toxicity are much lower after red versus white wine consump-
tion (58–61). Similarly, in studies of other alcohol-associated
malignancies, white wine was frequently found to be more
strongly associated than red wine or other forms or alcohol
(62–66), with some exceptions (67, 68).
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to test for residual con-
founding by UVR exposure (e.g., if white wine were preferen-
tially consumed outdoors in the summer months compared
with other beverage types). LMM is a subtype of melanoma that
occurs almost exclusively on sun-damaged skin (50). It is more
tightly associated with UVR exposure than other melanoma
subtypes. Therefore, if the association between white wine and
melanoma were secondary to residual confounding by UVR,
the association should be attenuated when LMM are excluded.
Our results were not sensitive to the exclusion of LMM, so
residual confounding by UVR exposure is unlikely to explain
the association.
Our study was limited by the homogeneity of our study
populations; all participants were white, educated, and largely
worked in health care settings. This makes residual confound-
ing by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, health care access,
or health literacy less likely, but may limit generalizability
in other populations, especially other racial/ethnic groups
(69–72). For example, among heavy drinkers, those who are
heterozygous for the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene
are up to 12 times more likely to develop esophageal cancer
compared with those who are homozygous for the active
enzyme (73, 74). The proportion of carriers of heterozygous
or homozygous forms of variant ALDH2 gene is much higher
in Asian populations than other populations. In addition, we
had few participants reporting heavy drinking in these cohorts,
which limited our investigation of the risks of higher levels of
alcohol intake. Finally, we were not able to take into account
some potential risk factors of melanoma such as sun protection
behaviors.

 Overall, our findings support carcinogenic role of alcohol in
development of melanoma and are consistent with the proven
carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages in other malignancies.
Furthermore, we found that the positive association between
alcohol consumption and melanoma risk was stronger with
melanoma of relatively UV-spared sites than UV-exposed sites.
The clinical and biologic significance of these findings remains to
be determined, but for motivated individuals with other strong
risk factors for melanoma, counseling regarding alcohol use
may be an appropriate risk reduction strategy to reduce risks of
melanoma as well as other cancers.

aAll results are reported as relative risk (95% CI). Multivariate estimates are
adjusted for age, BMI, smoking status, physical activity, caffeine intake, family
history of melanoma, tanning ability, lifetime number of severe sunburns,
number of moles on forearms, hair color at age 18, and average annual UV-B
flux at place of residence.
bHazard ratios per drink per day were estimated based on a standard
drink containing 12.8 g of alcohol. Melanomas of head, neck, and extremities;
P (for heterogeneity by study) ¼ 0.09, I2 ¼ 59, truncal melanomas; P > 0.99,
