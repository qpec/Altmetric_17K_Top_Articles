ABSTRACT
Widespread antibiotic use in clinical medicine and the livestock industry
has contributed to the global spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial patho-
gens, including Acinetobacter baumannii. We report on a method used to produce a
personalized bacteriophage-based therapeutic treatment for a 68-year-old diabetic
patient with necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by an MDR A. baumannii infection.
Despite multiple antibiotic courses and efforts at percutaneous drainage of a pancre-
atic pseudocyst, the patient deteriorated over a 4-month period. In the absence of
effective antibiotics, two laboratories identified nine different bacteriophages with
lytic activity for an A. baumannii isolate from the patient. Administration of these
bacteriophages intravenously and percutaneously into the abscess cavities was asso-
ciated with reversal of the patient’s downward clinical trajectory, clearance of the A.
baumannii infection, and a return to health. The outcome of this case suggests that
the methods described here for the production of bacteriophage therapeutics could
be applied to similar cases and that more concerted efforts to investigate the use of
therapeutic bacteriophages for MDR bacterial infections are warranted.

 multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections are increasingly more common. This problem
stems from a variety of factors, including widespread agricultural use of antibiotics,
inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, a decrease in the number of new antibiotics
entering the market, and the increased positive selection of multidrug resistance when
gained through the natural prokaryotic exchange of genetic material (reviewed in
reference 2).
The ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) patho-
gens are a group of commonly MDR organisms at the heart of the antibiotic resistance
crisis. As one of the ESKAPE pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii is a frequently isolated
organism from infections in clinical settings and has been of particular concern to
active-duty military service members injured in combat (3). A. baumannii is a Gram-
negative, naturally competent organism that is highly adept at acquiring and main-
taining multiple genetic elements encoding antimicrobial resistance determinants
(4–6). The growing impact of MDR pathogens has increased initiatives to discover
infectious disease therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action (7, 8). Recently, as part
of a collaboration between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy, we rescued mice from an
MDR A. baumannii wound infection using a mixture of natural phages that were
selected specifically for their synergistic activity against the infecting A. baumannii
strain (9). Even with these positive results, there are relatively few studies of phage
efficacy and/or safety in the current medical literature (relevant examples include
references 10 to 18). In addition to demonstrating that phage treatment can be
efficacious when a panel of phages are isolated from the environment against the
particular strain causing the infection, the A. baumannii study also demonstrated that
the surviving A. baumannii bacteria had decreased virulence, as measured in the
Galleria mellonella (wax worm) model (9). This decreased virulence of phage-resistant A.
baumannii was correlated with decreased capsule production, as measured by Raman
spectroscopy (9). In the present study, a bacterial isolate was provided from a patient
suffering from necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by an MDR A. baumannii-infected
pancreatic pseudocyst. In two independent laboratories, the patient’s initial isolate was
used to screen previously isolated phages and to select new phages for incorporation
into phage mixtures to make specific phage cocktails. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) authorization to administer the cocktails as an emergency investigational new
drug (eIND) was obtained, and the patient’s condition improved dramatically following
phage therapy. Here, we present our investigation of certain key aspects of the phage
therapy in vivo, such as cocktail development, pharmacokinetics, immune response,
and phage resistance. Despite an eventual rise of phage resistance, an iterative process
of phage cocktail formulation resulted in resolution of the patient’s infection. Interest-
ingly, the phage-resistant phenotype that arose over time was associated with in-
creased antibiotic sensitivity when phage and antibiotics were simultaneously admin-
istered.
RESULTS
A. baumannii susceptibility to bacteriophages. The clinical course of the patient,
a 68-year-old diabetic man who developed necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by an
MDR A. baumannii-infected pancreatic pseudocyst, is illustrated in Fig. 1. Due to the
patient’s rapidly deteriorating condition and the inability to control his infection with
antibiotics, a bacteriophage therapy process was embarked upon as an eIND. A subset
of 98 A. baumannii-specific lytic bacteriophages (out of 200 total) that were previously
harvested from environmental sources by the Biological Defense Research Directorate
(BDRD) of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) were screened for activity against
the three clinical isolates in this study (Fig. 2). This subset of 98 phages was initially
selected for screening because previous work had demonstrated that, collectively,
these bacteriophages are highly active against a broad range of MDR A. baumannii
isolates (data not shown). Within 18 h of receipt of the first clinical isolate, selection of
an appropriate therapeutic cocktail for the original isolate, named TP1, was

 achieved via an OmniLog-based time-kill assay system (19, 20). The bacterial
isolates from this study are summarized in Table 1. The assay revealed that most of
the phage screened have almost no discernible effect against this clinical isolate.
However, phage Ab�5, Ab�6, and Ab�73 were able to inhibit growth for up to 6 h.
Phage Ab�66 and Ab�68 were able to inhibit growth for 12 h. Most notably,
phages AB-Navy1, Ab�2, Ab�3, AB-Navy4, AB-Navy71, and AB-Navy97 were able to
inhibit growth for over 20 h. Phage AB-Navy1, AB-Navy4, AB-Navy71, and AB-
Navy97 were used in the phage cocktail based on previous host range analysis (data
not shown) that indicated that each phage was different from the others. TP1
growth inhibition effects were more pronounced when a cocktail of these bacte-
riophages was used than when individual bacteriophages were used separately
(Fig. 3).
Initial screening of 37 A. baumannii-specific bacteriophages against the TP1 isolate
at the Center for Phage Technology (CPT) at Texas A & M University revealed that one
of these bacteriophages, AC4 (originally obtained from AmpliPhi Corporation) inhibited
TP1 growth. Subsequently, three more bacteriophages (C1P12, C2P21, and C2P24) were
identified after additional screening of 100 environmental samples available at the CPT.
The capability of these three new bacteriophage isolates (C1P12, C2P21, and C2P24) to
inhibit TP1 growth was similar to that of bacteriophage AC4 (Fig. 3). The individual
bacteriophages used in this study are detailed in Table 2, and the composition and
administration of the bacteriophage cocktails are detailed in Table 3. With continued
treatment, in vitro susceptibility studies of serial A. baumannii isolates demonstrated
stepwise selection of resistance to the eight phages present in the original therapeutic
cocktails. Representative data related to the antimicrobial activity of the bacteriophages
comprising the �IV and �PC cocktails over the initial 3 weeks of therapy are presented
in Fig. 3a to c and Fig. 3e to g, respectively. It was determined retrospectively on day
19 of phage treatment by use of the OmniLog-based time-kill assay system that by day

 116 (which was the 8th day of bacteriophage therapy), each of the phages had lost
activity individually and in their respective original mixtures against the A. baumannii
isolates that emerged in the presence of the phages. In other words, the TP3 isolate was
found in vitro to be resistant to both of the two original bacteriophage cocktails.
Therefore, an additional phage, AbTP3�01, was selected for its activity against TP3 and
combined with one of the original phages (AB-Navy71) to produce a third phage
cocktail, called �IVB (Table 3), which was then administered to the patient.
Endotoxin level in bacteriophage preparation. As potential residual endotoxin
from the bacterial host cells could be harmful to the patient, each separate bacterio-
phage cocktail was assessed for residual endotoxin using a commercial assay. Average
endotoxin levels of bacteriophage cocktails �PC, �IV, and �IVB were 2.4 � 103
endotoxin units (EU)/ml, 5.89 � 103 EU/ml, and 1.64 � 103 EU/ml, respectively.
Therefore, each bacteriophage cocktail preparation was diluted accordingly in lactated
Ringer’s solution to meet the FDA-recommended endotoxin limitation for intravenous
(i.v.) application of 5 EU/kg of body weight/h.
Outcome of bacteriophage therapy. The patient’s prognosis was grave when
bacteriophage therapy was first initiated with cocktail �PC through percutaneous
catheters draining the pseudocyst cavity, the biliary cavity, and a third intra-abdominal
cavity. During this time, the patient was unresponsive to commands and had devel-
oped renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.68 mg/dl. Over the next 36 h, his clinical
condition was stable, but he remained comatose, intubated, and on three pressors with

were individually tested against the A. baumannii TP1 strain using the OmniLog system (Biolog, Hayward, CA) as described in
references 19 and 20. Briefly, growth of bacteria or lack of growth due to lysis from phage infection was monitored every 15
min via a redox chemical reaction employing cellular respiration as a universal reporter, where cellular respiration from growth
reduces a tetrazolium-based dye and produces a color change. If the growth is weakly positive or is negative, then respiration
is slow or absent and so little to no color change is observed. The results of this assay after 20 h are summarized here, where
the color gradient indicates the duration of bacterial growth inhibition.

and since it was clear that his A. baumannii infection included anatomic sites well
beyond the intra-abdominal cavities, an additional systemic administration of the
bacteriophage therapy was instigated through intravenous administration of a new

tolerated and was repeated at increasingly frequent intervals over the next 2 days. The

concentration of minocycline (0.25 �g/ml) against A. baumannii strain TP3. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of

 patient’s pressor requirements diminished, and he abruptly awoke from his coma and
became conversant with his family for the first time in several weeks. It was then noted
that a recent A. baumannii isolate was susceptible to minocycline, and that antibiotic
was added to his regimen 4 days after the initial administration of cocktail �PC. Over
the ensuing 3 weeks, the course remained complex, but the patient generally demon-
strated ongoing improvement on all fronts. His mental status continued to improve,
and he was fully conversant and lucid. He was weaned off the ventilator, his pressors
were gradually weaned and discontinued, and his renal function gradually improved.
Bacteriophage therapy was continued for an additional 8 weeks, during which time he
demonstrated continued clinical improvement. All drains were removed and he was
discharged home on day 245. He has subsequently returned to work.
Emergence of bacteriophage-resistant bacteria during bacteriophage therapy.
During the course of treatment, the bacteriophages used in this study were examined
for in vitro activity against successive patient isolates as those isolates became available.
Consequently, it was discovered that an A. baumannii isolate, TP3, which was isolated
8 days after initiation of bacteriophage therapy, was resistant to both of the initially
used bacteriophage cocktails (�PC and �IV). Therefore, TP3 was used to rapidly (within
72 h) select for additional bacteriophages with lytic activity against this isolate. Using
conventional bacteriophage enrichment techniques, an additional bacteriophage,
AbTP3�01, was isolated from raw sewage that inhibited growth of isolate TP3. Inter-
estingly, this effect was enhanced when AbTP3�01 was combined with bacteriophage
AB-Navy71 from the original �IV cocktail (Fig. 3d). The activity of the �IV cocktail was
tested in combination with different concentrations of minocycline to determine
whether the bacteriophage cocktail affected the activity of sub-MICs of the drug. As
shown in Fig. 3h, although the bacteriophage cocktail itself had lost activity against the
organism, the bacteriophage appeared to prevent the outgrowth of bacteria with
enhanced minocycline resistance after extended culture.
Bacteriophage pharmacokinetics. To better understand the pharmacokinetics of
intravenous administration of therapeutic bacteriophages, we examined the titer of
active phage in plasma samples after i.v. administration of the �IVB phage cocktail. We
found bacteriophage concentrations of 18,000 PFU/ml in plasma 5 min after an i.v.
bolus of 4 � 109 PFU of bacteriophages. These levels fell over the 6-h dosing interval
(Fig. 4). An in vitro study of phage inactivation in plasma was subsequently conducted
using plasma collected 90 days following cessation of phage therapy. The study

 demonstrated that the titer of each phage in the �IVB phage cocktail as well as phage
AbTP3�1 declined at a higher rate when suspended in the patient’s plasma than when
suspended in normal saline. This supports the possibility that phage neutralization by
plasma might be one of the contributors to the decay of phage activity in plasma in the
pharmacokinetic studies (see the supplemental material).
Morphological characteristics of bacteriophages and the hosts. Electron micro-
graphs of the �IV and �PC cocktail bacteriophages indicated that these bacterio-
phages display a short tail with well-defined head structure. Morphologically, these
eight bacteriophages are all consistent with the Myoviridae family of bacteriophage,
whereas bacteriophage AbTP3�1 is comparatively small and consistent with the
Podoviridae family (Fig. 5).
In addition, we sought to investigate the morphological characteristics of the
bacterial isolates and some phenotypic differences observed among them. First, fol-
lowing cultivation of the patient’s isolates in the laboratory, a “sticky” phenotype was
observed only for TP3. As organisms absorbed water, a mucinous overlayer was formed.
Second, Raman spectroscopy was conducted on TP1, TP2, and TP3 with the purpose
of examining alterations in molecular composition of bacterial isolates during the
evolution of phage resistance. Mean Raman spectra of each isolate are shown in Fig. 6a.
Raman spectra are dominated by polysaccharide and protein contributions. The Raman
spectral band at 979 cm�1 previously reported to be associated with capsule-related
colony morphology and phage susceptibility in AB5075 strains (9) was not observed in
any of the interrogated strains, suggesting alterations to capsule structure in the
encapsulated TP strains. When the spectra of TP1 (capsulated, susceptible to first
cocktail), TP2 (capsulated, reduced susceptibility to first cocktail), and TP3 (unencap-

 sulated, resistant to first cocktail) are compared, the intensity within the 1,030 to 1,380
cm�1 region is significantly increased for TP2 and TP3 spectra and only minor altera-
tions in relative peak intensities are observed across all thee strains. For bacterial
isolates, the 1,030 to 1,380 cm�1 spectral region is composed of contributions from
both proteins and polysaccharides. There are no observed changes within the amide I
region (1,600 to 1,700 cm�1), a spectral region sensitive to changes in protein contri-
bution and secondary structure and not associated with polysaccharides (21, 22). The
marked increase in peak intensity within 1,030 to 1,380 cm�1 can therefore be
attributed to increased polysaccharide content in TP2 and TP3 samples. Loss of the
bacterial capsule in TP3 with an observed increase in polysaccharide content suggests
increased production of extracellular polymeric substance in response to phage treat-
ment and may contribute to the transition in phage susceptibility observed from TP1
to TP3. Finally, given these results, we performed capsular staining of TP1, TP2, and TP3
isolates. Upon staining and microscopy, TP1 and TP2 were both found to exhibit a
typical capsule, whereas TP3 did not (Fig. 6b to d; see Fig. S3 to S5 in the supplemental
material), consistent with these Raman spectroscopy data interpretations.

preparation of personalized therapeutic bacteriophage cocktails to rescue a patient

 from a life-threatening MDR A. baumannii infection. This case supports further study of
the use of phage therapy in treating patients suffering from MDR bacterial infections
with limited therapeutic options. As with any uncontrolled clinical observation, there
are a number of important caveats; primarily, we cannot exclude the possibility that
reversal of his clinical deterioration was unrelated to the phage therapy. However, after
an inexorably downhill clinical course over the prior 3 months to the point that
discussions about clinical futility had been initiated, a clear turning point was observed
within 48 h of starting intravenous bacteriophage therapy. The potential interplay
between the bacteriophages used in the patient’s therapy and minocycline is also
complex. His A. baumannii infection rapidly became resistant to colistin and tigecycline
early in the course of treatment, but the activity of minocycline was maintained for
several weeks when it was added to his bacteriophage therapy 5 days after bacterio-
phage therapy was initiated. We were able to demonstrate an additive in vitro activity
between the bacteriophages and subinhibitory concentrations of minocycline when
used in combination against a bacteriophage-resistant A. baumannii isolate. Additive or
synergistic activity between bacteriophages and traditional antibiotics has been pre-
viously demonstrated both in vitro and in animal model systems (for examples, see
references 9, 18, and 23 to 25 and references therein). Of particular relevance is a recent
paper by Oechslin et al. (18) describing the interaction between phage and antibiotics
in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa endocarditis infection model which includes unprece-
dented practical evidence for the idea that the most significant benefits of phage
therapy will emerge synergistically and that the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria
can be avoided or delayed through combination therapy. It is worth noting the
significantly different pharmacokinetic data between our study and the report by
Oechslin et al. Where phage clearance was on the order of hours in the rat model, it was
on the order of minutes in our human patient. Differences between the two studies
could contribute to the differences observed. In the Oechslin study, the phage plasma
longevity was measured using a cocktail consisting of 12 phages in uninfected rats
rather than 4 phages in the presence of infection. In addition, the phage titer-to-body
weight ratio differed greatly. In the animal study 1 � 1010 PFU/ml was injected into the
small rat body whereas 5 � 109 phages were injected into a much larger human body
in our study. It is also possible that differences in plasma clearance kinetics reflect
antibody-mediated neutralization or other clearance mechanisms that were operative
in our patient that were not present in the rat model. A fuller understanding of
peripheral blood phage kinetics in humans will require more systematic studies in
additional patients.
Bacterial mutation to phage resistance has also been associated with significant
fitness costs for the bacterium. Surface features such as capsule, lipopolysaccharide, or
pili may be used as bacteriophage receptors but can also be pathogenicity factors, and
their loss may result in attenuated virulence (29). Although A. baumannii was not
immediately cleared from abscess cavity drainage or bronchial washings, strains with
substantially reduced susceptibility to the phages administered subsequently emerged.
This strongly suggests that the A. baumannii population evolved in response to
selection pressure exerted by the phages. In fact, we observed differences in colony
morphology among these isolates, which could possibly be due to differences in
capsular production and a loss of virulence, consistent with previous results obtained
from phage treatment in a mouse model of A. baumannii infection (9). Results obtained
from Raman spectroscopy and capsular staining are in support of this idea, with Raman
spectroscopy showing subtle differences among all three isolates and what could
potentially be an extracellular polymeric substance associated with TP3 and capsular
staining indicating lack of capsule around TP3 cells. It has been shown in other studies
that culturing A. baumannii with antibiotics at concentrations below the MIC can result
in differences in capsular production (26). The lack of capsule on TP3 cells may also
contribute to the enhancement of their phage-antibiotic synergy, possibly because
antibiotics may more easily penetrate TP3’s outer membrane (Fig. 3h). Although A.
baumannii with putative reduced fitness could be isolated from open abscess cavities

 and bronchial washings for some time after the initiation of phage therapy, the only
time phage was documented in the patient’s bloodstream after therapy was initiated
was in association with migration of his cholecystostomy tube into his hepatic paren-
chyma on day 127. The bacterial isolates from this study, as well as the bacteriophages
used in treatment, are currently being characterized at the genetic level to facilitate our
understanding of the mechanisms involved in the loss of capsule, the enhancement of
antibiotic synergy, and the rise of bacteriophage resistance during the course of this
patient’s treatment with phages.
A number of concerns have been raised about the potential toxicities and the
practicality of bacteriophage therapy for MDR bacterial infections. However, in this
particular case, we overcame these hurdles and did not observe any discernible adverse
clinical events. For example, concerns have arisen about the possibility that an accel-
erated lysis of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens could release clinically significant
levels of endotoxin (27, 28). A parallel concern can be made for administration of some
antibiotics or any other alternative treatment that could lead to rapid, widespread cell
lysis. While the patient’s clinical instability at the time therapy was initiated made it
difficult to detect all but the most dramatic deleterious clinical effects of phage therapy,
no adverse effects of phage administration were evident in association with either the
intracavitary or i.v. phage administrations.
It has also been posited that phages could facilitate the transfer of genetic elements
conferring drug resistance and pathogenicity among bacteria; however, by producing
phage on the same bacterial isolate already present in the patient, the risk of intro-
ducing exogenous genetic information conferring increased virulence or antibiotic
resistance is minimized. The inherent specificity of bacteriophage to the species if not
strain level minimizes the potential of horizontal gene transfer, in comparison to more
promiscuous plasmid conjugation or the uptake of exogenous DNA in naturally trans-
formable hosts. Counter to the concerns for increased antibiotic resistance following
phage therapy, in the current case, we also consistently observed decreased resistance
to antibiotics after phage therapy. Additionally, the narrow bacterial host range of
bacteriophages can also be a potential advantage in the treatment of MDR organisms,
as their specificity would be less likely to perturb the commensal microbiome of the
patient.
Since A. baumannii phages have narrow host ranges, it was necessary to identify
phages capable of propagating on the TP1 strain isolated from the patient. Through a
labor-intensive enterprise, two laboratories were each able to independently identify,
propagate, and purify four bacteriophages with lytic activity directed at the isolate
within 10 days of receiving the strain. A. baumannii isolates characterized after the start
of bacteriophage therapy had reduced susceptibility to the initial bacteriophages. The
emergence of bacteriophage-resistant populations of A. baumannii was likely delayed
by the use of combinations of bacteriophages (see Fig. 3f for an example). When the
resistant bacteria were isolated, it was possible to compose a new bacteriophage
cocktail that was active against the bacteriophage-resistant A. baumannii strain (TP3) to
counter the emergence of phage-resistant subpopulations. The specificity of anti-
bacteriophage systems makes it unlikely that broad anti-bacteriophage mechanisms
will arise, as opposed to the spread of multidrug-resistant efflux pump mechanisms in
response to conventional broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Finally, other reported
benefits of bacteriophage therapy include an ability to exhibit synergy with or restore
susceptibility to conventional antimicrobial agents, as observed in this case, and the
potential ability to disrupt biofilms (24, 25).
Many questions remain about the clinical potential of bacteriophage therapy for
serious MDR organisms. Future studies should focus on delineating and optimizing
safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, multiplicity of infection and valency,
efficiency of bacteriophage identification and deployment, modes of administration,
and methodologies for monitoring the emergence of bacteriophage resistance once
therapy is initiated. In addition, the impact of phage on biofilms and on the microbiome
of the host is of interest, as is how best to manage concomitant antimicrobial therapy.

 These trials will face the same challenges posed by those who seek to evaluate novel
small-molecule antimicrobial agents in the treatment of patients with severe multidrug-
resistant infections. Nonetheless, while it is clear that administering phage as a mono-
therapy is unlikely in cases of serious illness, with the increasing threats posed by MDR
bacterial pathogens and the slow progress in the development of novel classes of
traditional antimicrobial agents, novel approaches are required. In this context, clinical
trials focusing on delineating the extent to which bacteriophage-based therapeutics
could be used on their own as a last resort or as an adjunct to traditional antibiotics are
warranted.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. baumannii clinical isolates. A. baumannii clinical isolates were cultured from multiple drains,
peritoneal fluid, and respiratory secretions of the patient. The three isolates used in this study were
designated TP1, TP2, and TP3 for the first, second, and third temporal variants, respectively. A. baumannii
isolates originally used to harvest natural phages from various environmental samples were genetically
diverse and obtained from the Navy’s Wound Infections Culture Collection, originally received from the
Army’s Multidrug-Resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network (MRSN) and the Naval Med-
ical Research Unit 6 in Lima, Peru. All A. baumannii isolates were maintained on tryptic soy broth (TSB;
Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) and stored in 15% glycerol at �80°
C.
Selection of therapeutic phages. Phages used for this treatment were selected and prepared for
clinical use by two different groups. Phages provided by the Biological Defense Research Directorate
(BDRD) of the Naval Medical Research Center (AB-Navy1, AB-Navy4, AB-Navy71, AB-Navy97, and
AbTP3�1) were isolated from various environmental samples by using routine isolation techniques, as
previously described (9). Briefly, A. baumannii clinical isolates from the Navy’s Wound Infections Culture
Collection were used to isolate and store pathogen-specific phages. Following isolation, the phages were
triple plaque-purified on their respective host bacterium. Finally, small-scale phage amplifications on
their corresponding host bacterium were performed to prepare the A. baumannii-specific phage library,
which was subsequently stored at 4°
C until required. The growth of A. baumannii clinical isolates TP1,
TP2, and TP3 in the presence of phage was evaluated via spot testing and also in a Biolog imaging system
(Biolog, Hayward, CA) (19, 20). In this case, one covered 96-well plate was used per phage strain and
incubated at 37°
C for 24 h, with wells positive only for bacteria and test wells with a single phage added
at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 100. The phage candidates that showed the strongest
antibacterial activity as measured by this assay were selected for inclusion in the therapeutic cocktails:
AB-Navy1, AB-Navy4, AB-Navy71, AB-Navy97 against strain TP1, and, later, AbTP3�1 against strain TP3.
At the Center for Phage Technology (CPT), 10 A. baumannii phages from the CPT collection and 30
more solicited from multiple academic, clinical, and corporate sources were screened for activity on TP1
by spot assays using crude lysates. A phage from AmpliPhi Corporation, AC4, was found to form plaques
on lawns of TP1. Another 100 environmental samples available at the CPT were screened by enrichment,
yielding three new isolates (C1P12, C2P21, and C2P24) that inhibited growth of TP1.
Propagation and purification of therapeutic bacteriophages. Large-scale bacteriophage amplifi-
cation of each BDRD bacteriophage isolate was performed in two steps before purification. First, initial
amplifications (via a plate lysate method) of the phage were used to inoculate 3.6-liter large-scale liquid
lysates (10). These lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 � g for 20 min to remove bacterial debris, vacuum
filtered through 0.22-�m filters, and then concentrated using a Millipore Pelican 2 cassette 300,000-
molecular-weight-cutoff (MWCO) tangential-flow filtration system to a volume of approximately 0.5 liter.
Following concentration, the culture medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via
diafiltration. The resulting lysate was further concentrated via diafiltration to a final volume of 0.2 liter
prior to collection. Finally, the concentrated bacteriophage mixture was purified using CsCl isopycnic
gradient centrifugation as previously described (10) and dialyzed in PBS to remove cesium chloride.
Purified bacteriophages were combined into a four-bacteriophage cocktail designated �IV. After the
patient’s A. baumannii isolate became insensitive to the �IV bacteriophage cocktail, a second bacterio-
phage cocktail designated �IVB was prepared by combining AB-Navy71 from the original cocktail with
a newly isolated bacteriophage (AbTP3�01) that was capable of forming plaques on lawns of A.
baumannii TP3.
At the CPT, large-scale propagation and purification of phages C1P12, C2P21, C2P24, and AC4 was
performed using plate lysates grown from single plaques to inoculate 1-liter logarithmic cultures of the
host at an input MOI of �102 in the presence of 5 mM MgSO4. The infected cultures were grown until
the onset of lysis, as measured by optical density at 550 nm (OD550), at which time sodium citrate was
added to a final concentration of 10 mM. The infected culture was aerated until lysis was complete.
Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (6,000 � g, 40 min, 4°
C) and sterilized by filtration through
0.22-�m membranes. Bacteriophages were concentrated by centrifugation at 6,000 � g for 10 h at 4°
C,
and phage pellets were gently resuspended in 10 ml of Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline and
sterilized again by filtration. The sterilized phage suspensions were subjected to ultrafiltration and
1-octanol extraction to remove lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as previously described (30). In most cases, this
final treatment was performed at the Laboratory for Viral Information at San Diego State University. The
four phages were combined to comprise a cocktail (�PC) that was used for intracavitary administration.
Phage were introduced into each cavity every 6 h.

 Efficiency of plating of selected bacteriophages on clinical isolates. To evaluate the killing
efficacy of each phage on clinical isolates, a dilution series of bacteriophage preparation was spotted on
a bacterial lawn to observe plaque formation (25). Briefly, 100 �l of an overnight culture of each A.
baumannii isolate was used to individually inoculate 2.5 ml of 0.7% molten top agar (temperature, 50°
C).
The inoculated agar was spread onto tryptic soy (TS) agar plates. Top agar was allowed to cool at room
temperature, and then 10-�l aliquots of 10-fold serial dilutions of each selected bacteriophage were
spotted on the plate surface. All spots were allowed to fully absorb into the top agar, and the plates were
incubated at 37°
C for 24 h in a humidified chamber for plaque formation.
Electron microscopy. The A. baumannii phages were grown in their corresponding host by standard
procedures and purified via CsCl density gradient centrifugation. The phage preparation was fixed using
a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 1.0% glutaraldehyde, spread onto electron microscope grids,
negatively stained with uranyl acetate, and imaged in an FEI Tecnai T12 transmission electron micro-
scope.
Endotoxin assays in phage preparations. Endotoxin levels of each �IV cocktail were estimated
using the QCL-1000 endpoint chromogenic LAL assay, and �PC endotoxin levels were determined by the
PyroGene recombinant factor C assay (Lonza, Walkersville, MD), according to the manufacturer’s direc-
tions.
The MDR A. baumannii infection and pathophysiology of the patient. The patient, a 68-year-old
diabetic man, developed gallstone-induced acute pancreatitis. An abdominal computed tomography
(CT) scan revealed a pancreatic pseudocyst (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The pseudocyst
was drained through two pigtail cystogastrostomy tubes, and a pancreatic stent was placed. Cultures of
the pseudocyst aspirate grew Candida albicans and MDR A. baumannii. The patient received courses of
vancomycin, meropenem, colistin, and tigecycline. A subsequent culture from the pseudocyst fluid grew
A. baumannii that was resistant to cephalosporins, meropenem, gentamicin, amikacin, trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and colistin. Susceptibility testing revealed synergy be-
tween colistin and azithromycin against the MDR A. baumannii, and treatment with these two antibiotics
was initiated on day 36 after the initial infection. MDR A. baumannii was repeatedly isolated from multiple
abdominal drains, the patient’s clinical condition further deteriorated, and on day 51, he developed
respiratory failure and hypotension requiring intubation, fluid resuscitation, pressors, and ultimately
transfer to the intensive care unit. Rifampin was determined in vitro to provide added antibiotic synergy
against the MDR A. baumannii isolate, and it was therefore included in his regimen. During the remainder
of the second and third months of hospitalization, the patient’s clinical course further deteriorated. He
developed emphysematous cholecystitis and became increasingly delirious, with declining renal function
and increasing leukocyte counts. Cultures of multiple drains, peritoneal fluid, and respiratory secretions
all produced MDR A. baumannii. Renal and hepatic function worsened. By day 108, the patient was on
multiple pressors and was unresponsive, with a plasma creatinine level of 3.68 mg/dl. Due to the
unavailability of any additional effective antimicrobial agents, an eIND application was submitted to the
FDA requesting authorization to treat his uncontrolled A. baumannii infection with a combination of
phages.
Treatment with phage. Phage therapy was initiated on day 109 (after the initial infection) with the
installation of a cocktail containing four of the anti-A. baumannii phages (�109 PFU/dose) described
previously as �PC through percutaneous catheters draining the pseudocyst cavity, the gallbladder, and
a third intra-abdominal cavity. Intracavitary instillations of this cocktail were continued at 6- to 12-h
intervals. Thirty-six hours after the initiation of intracavitary instillations of the bacteriophage cocktail,
bacteriophage therapy was intensified and broadened through the intravenous administration of an
additional bacteriophage cocktail (�109 PFU/dose) consisting of the Navy’s four anti-A. baumannii
bacteriophages (described previously as �IV). Since this was well tolerated, i.v. bacteriophage therapy
was repeated 12 h later and then at increasingly frequent intervals over the next 2 days to reach a dosing
frequency of every 2 h. Azithromycin, colistin, and rifampin were discontinued; meropenem and
fluconazole were continued. However, 2 days following initiation of intravenous phage therapy, the
patient’s pressor requirements abruptly increased and bacteriophage therapy was temporarily withheld.
The meropenem dose was increased, and intravenous catheters were changed. It was subsequently
demonstrated that the clinical deterioration was accompanied by a transient septic episode with
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron bacteria that were felt to have arisen from his pancreas. On day 115, the
patient’s A. baumannii isolate was found to be susceptible to minocycline (3 �g/ml), which was added
to the patient’s treatment regimen. Intracavitary and intravenous bacteriophage therapies were resumed
on days 116 and 118, respectively. Subsequently, the combinations of intracavitary and intravenous
therapy with the �PC and �IV cocktails, respectively, were continued (generally at 6- to 8-h intervals)
until day 167. When reduced phage susceptibility of serial isolates of the patient’s A. baumannii was
demonstrated in vitro, a third bacteriophage cocktail consisting of one new bacteriophage and one of the
initially selected phages (designated �IVB) was developed to effectively target the phage-resistant
bacterial isolate and administered during the last 2 weeks of therapy. With ongoing clinical improvement,
minocycline and meropenem were discontinued on days 168 and 179, respectively. Combinations of
intracavitary and intravenous bacteriophage therapy were continued for a total of 59 days.
Pharmacokinetic studies. Plasma and serum samples were collected after bacteriophage therapy
and filtered through 0.22-�m Corning Spin-X filters. An aliquot of each filtrate was further diluted 1:10
and 1:100 in SM buffer, and 10 �l of each concentration of plasma/serum dilutions was mixed with 100
�l of cultured A. baumannii TP1 at an OD of 0.5. The bacteriophage-bacterium mixtures were incubated
at 37°
C for 20 min before being plated via soft agar overlay (31). The plates were incubated at 37°
C
overnight in a humidified chamber, and bacteriophage plaques were counted the next day.

 Raman spectroscopic analysis of A. baumannii strains. A. baumannii isolates were examined for
modifications in cellular and extracellular composition via Raman spectroscopy using a Kaiser Rxn1 PhAT
probe 830-nm system (Kaiser Optical Systems, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) and a 1-mm diameter excitation spot
size as previously described (9). Prior to spectral data acquisition, each sample was obtained from LB agar
plates and directly transferred to an aluminum foil-covered disposable weigh dish for spectral data
collection. Dark spectrum-subtracted and intensity-corrected spectra were each acquired using 5-s
acquisitions, 10 accumulations, and the cosmic ray removal feature selected for a total laser exposure of
100 s. Each sample was assayed in three locations, one spectrum per location. Per sample, the three
localized spectra were examined to ensure steady sample hydration and spectral consistency across
locations. Once verified, spectra were averaged per sample, truncated to 600 to 1,800 cm�1, baseline
subtracted using a sixth-order polynomial fitting routine, and normalized to the methyl/methylene
scissoring band at 1,445 cm�1 (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material for a schematic).
Capsule staining. A. baumannii isolates were examined for potential capsule expression using crystal
violet staining. For each isolate, a loopful of bacteria in PBS was used to smear a glass slide and then
allowed to air dry. Each slide was stained with crystal violet for 1 min, rinsed with 20% copper sulfate,
and dried prior to imaging at �100 magnification under oil immersion using an Olympus BX51TRF
microscope equipped with an Olympus DP72 camera (Olympus Corporation, Waltham, MA).
