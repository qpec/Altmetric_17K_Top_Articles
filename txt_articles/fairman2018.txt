Abstract
Recent loosening of state and federal policy restrictions on marijuana, along with changes in social norms regarding marijuana
use and decreases in prevalence of other types of substance use, may lead to increases in youth initiating marijuana before other
types of substances such as alcohol and tobacco. We investigated predictors and potential consequences of initiating marijuana
before other drugs for youth aged 12–21-years in the USA. Nationally representative, cross-sectional survey data from the US
National Survey on Drug Use and Health supplied self-reported age of first marijuana, cigarettes, alcohol, other tobacco, and
other illegal drug use among 12–21-year-old samples from 2004 to 2014 (n = 275,559). We first examined the degree to which
initiating marijuana use first was associated with sex, age, race/ethnicity, and survey year. Then, we examined whether using
marijuana first predicted heavy marijuana use, cannabis use disorder (CUD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), nicotine dependence
(ND), or lifetime use of other illegal drugs. Among all survey youth (substance users and non-users), the proportion using
marijuana first increased from 4.8 to 8.8% from 2004 to 2014. Those using marijuana first (vs. alcohol or cigarettes first) were
more likely to be male and older and Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, multiracial, or Hispanic than White or Asian.
Among substance users and adjusting for age of onset and the number of substances used, using marijuana first was associated
higher odds of heavy current marijuana use and CUD. In recent years, youth have been increasingly likely to use marijuana as
their first drug and sequence of initiation is associated with race/ethnicity, gender, and age. Using marijuana first might increase
the chance of heavy use and CUD.

Initiation of tobacco and alcohol use usually precedes first of
use of marijuana or other illegal drugs; this pattern has been
characterized in the well-cited Bgateway hypothesis^ (Kandel
and Kandel 2015; Kirby and Barry 2012; Ramo et al. 2012).
Behavioral neuropharmacology research suggests that nico-
tine may Bprime^ the brain to appreciate the reinforcing ef-
fects of extrinsic substances, such as alcohol or marijuana
(Kandel and Kandel 2014). Importantly, priming could work
in the reverse direction; meaning marijuana use could increase
sensitivity to the rewarding effects of nicotine (Ellgren et al.
2007; Panlilio et al. 2013). Therefore, whichever drug is used
first could become a Bgateway,^ in the sense that use could
lead to use of other substances. Examining adolescents’ drug
sequences may enhance our understanding of factors that in-
fluence initiation of substance use, subsequent use of other
substances, and drug-related outcomes.
The specific order of initiation of specific drugs used may
vary based on several factors, including drug availability and
legal status of drugs. Nationally representative US data show
that there have been steep declines in adolescent cigarette and
alcohol use, contrasted by either relatively stable or periods of

 slightly increasing marijuana use (Johnson et al. 2015;
Johnston et al. 2017; Nguyen et al. 2018). Nearly twice as
many 12–17-year-olds report past 30-day marijuana use vs.
cigarette use (respectively, 6.5 and 3.4%), whereas 9.2% re-
port past 30-day alcohol use (Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration 2017). These trends coincide
with loosening of US state policies on marijuana use for
adults, and implementation of multi-tiered efforts to curb un-
derage cigarette and alcohol use (e.g., excise taxes, diversion
prevention strategies) (Friend et al. 2011; Hingson and White
2014). Consequently, today’s youth may have higher levels of
access and exposure to marijuana than previous generations
and may be more likely to initiate marijuana use prior to to-
bacco or alcohol. Although data are limited, changes to the
drug sequence could have implications for the future risk of
substance use disorders (SUDs) and other drug-related out-
comes. In this study, we investigated the trends, characteris-
tics, and potential consequences of initiating marijuana before
other substances among youth aged 12–21 years in the US,
from 2004 to 2014.
There are only a handful of studies that have examined
factors associated with initiating marijuana first, i.e., before
tobacco, alcohol, or other substances. Studies of adults have
shown that 18–30-year-olds are more likely to initiate mari-
juana before other substances than those older than 30
(Degenhardt et al. 2009, 2010; Wells and McGee 2008).
Additionally, US studies have noted higher rates of using mar-
ijuana before tobacco or alcohol among Blacks (Green et al.
2016; Kennedy et al. 2016; Sartor et al. 2013; Vaughn et al.
2008). This body of work has key limitations; most studies are
based on adult (vs. adolescent) samples, were conducted out-
side the USA, and/or used data that are at least 10–15 years old
(Degenhardt et al. 2009; Green et al. 2016). The present study
builds on what is known and will provide information about
drug sequencing among adolescents within the modern
context.
Studies have also examined whether initiating marijuana
before other substances (typically tobacco or alcohol) influ-
ences later substance-related outcomes compared to the typi-
cal initiation sequence of tobacco and/or alcohol then marijua-
na, and there is mixed evidence supporting that initiating sub-
stance use with marijuana first is associated with adverse out-
comes. One study conducted in a US adult female twin sample
reported that using marijuana before alcohol was associated
with a more rapid transition to marijuana-related problems
(Sartor et al. 2013). A couple of studies, one conducted among
14–15-year-olds in Australia and another in a cohort of US
adolescents, found that marijuana use increased the likelihood
of smoking cigarettes and becoming tobacco dependent
(Patton et al. 2005; Timberlake et al. 2007). Included in the
present issue, Nguyen et al. (2018) analyses of AddHealth
data show that adolescent marijuana use is a risk factor for
later daily cigarette smoking among women. On the other
hand, two studies conducted in the USA and New Zealand
found that using marijuana before tobacco and alcohol was
not associated with an increased odds of marijuana, alcohol, or
tobacco dependence among users (Degenhardt et al. 2009;
Wells and McGee 2008).
We build upon this literature by first identifying cross-
sectional trends in the proportion of youth initiating marijuana
before other substances and the demographic characteristics of
such users. Next, we examined the degree to which initiating
marijuana before other substances was associated with preva-
lent marijuana- and other drug-related outcomes: (1) daily or
near daily marijuana use, (2) cannabis use disorder, (3) alcohol
use disorder, (4) nicotine dependence, and (5) lifetime use of
other drugs. A methodological innovation of our study
allowed us to better differentiate the sequence of marijuana,
cigarette, and alcohol onset when individuals self-report using
two or more of these substances at the same age. In prior
studies, even those based on prospective designs, the order
of drug onset is based on self-reported age of first use or onset
between successive follow-ups. Ties where age of first use
coincide can be as high as 20–30% (Kennedy et al. 2016;
Sartor et al. 2013). Studies often either exclude such ties, treat
them as a separate group, or do not disclose how they are
treated (Golub and Johnson 2002; Kandel and Yamaguchi
1993; Kennedy et al. 2016; Sartor et al. 2013). Pointed
follow-up questions allowed for a more precise determination
of the order in the drug-using sequence.
Methods
Data and Sample
Data were from the publicly available 2004–2014 US
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a nation-
ally representative, household-based annual series of cross-
sectional surveys on drug use and their correlates (United
States Department of Health and Human Services 2016). A
multistage area probability sampling design selected designat-
ed participants from a target population of civilian, non-
institutionalized US residents aged 12 years and older (n =
615,701 total sampled across survey years). Trained field staff
conducted interviews using audio computer-assisted self-in-
terview (ACASI) and computer-assisted personal interview
(CAPI) methods to enhance confidentiality and accurate
reporting of sensitive behaviors, such as drug use.
Participants were compensated $30 for completed interviews;
the average participation level for 2004–2014 was 65%. All
participants were provided with informed consent and proce-
dures were approved by the appropriate institutional review
board for the protection of human subjects. Further details of
the NSDUH methodology have been published online (http://
Prev Sci
 www.samhsa.gov/data/population-data-nsduh/reports?tab=
38; last accessed 27 02 2018).
The present study focused on a subsample of participants
aged 12–21 years old (n = 275,559; 48% of the total sampled).
Excluded were adults aged 22 or older (n = 318,069) due to
concerns about accurate age of drug onset recall, and partici-
pants whose age of first drug used could not be determined
due to missing data (n = 22,073; 7.4% of 12–21-year-olds).
Measures
Initiation of Substance Use
Participants reported age of first use for marijuana, cigarettes,
other tobacco products (i.e., cigars, snuff, chew, and smoke-
less tobacco), alcohol, and other drugs (i.e., inhalants, cocaine,
heroin, and non-medical prescription drugs) in response to a
series of questions that asked: BHow old were you when you
first used [drug]?^ When the age of onset for cigarettes, alco-
hol, and marijuana coincided (i.e., ties), a series of follow-up
items were asked. The first item read: BEarlier, the computer
recorded that you started using [these substances] when you
were [age] years old. Which did you use first?^; the second
read: BAfter first using [first drug], which of these did you use
next?^ Based on responses to these items, a small value (0.1)
was added to the participants’ age of onset when one drug was
reported to occur after another (i.e., making them slightly
older). The user-defined rowranks command available in
Stata ranked the order of onset for each drug based on the
age of onset (Cox 2009; StataCorp 2013). A variable was
constructed to indicate which drug was initiated first (if at
all): (1) no drug use, (2) cigarettes, (3) alcohol, (4) marijuana,
(5) other tobacco products, and (6) other drugs. Seventeen
percent of the sample had completed these follow-up items.
Drug-related Outcomes
Participants were asked about the number of days they
had used marijuana in the last 30 days and in the last
12 months. Heavy marijuana use was defined as reporting
marijuana use on either ≥ 20 or more days in the past
month or ≥ 300 days in the past year. Participants were
classified as having a cannabis use disorder (CUD) or
alcohol use disorder (AUD) if, within the last 12 months,
they had met one or more features of abuse or three or
more features of dependence based on criteria in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
4th Edition (American Psychiatric Association 1994).
Those whose total score on the Nicotine Dependence
Syndrome Scale was ≥ 2.75 were classified as having nic-
otine dependence (ND) (Shiffman et al. 2004). Any life-
time use of other drugs was based on responses to items
about having ever used inhalants, cocaine, heroin, and
non-medical prescription drugs.
Demographic Factors
We included demographic factors as covariates, including sex,
age at interview, and race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity categories
included White, Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native,
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Asian, and
Multiracial, all non-Hispanic, and a final category for
Hispanic/Latino respondents of any race.
Analyses
First, we estimated the proportion of youth who initiated sub-
stance use with marijuana, cigarettes, alcohol, other tobacco
products, and other illicit drugs, and examined variation by
demographic characteristics and survey year. Next, we used
multinomial logistic regression to estimate the degree to
which demographic characteristics and survey year were in-
dependently associated with initiating marijuana first, relative
to alternative initiation sequences, including (1) marijuana vs.
no drug use, (2) marijuana vs. cigarettes first, and (3) marijua-
na vs. alcohol first. In these models, the probability or risk of
initiating marijuana first compared to one of these alternative
sequences (i.e., the reference group) is expressed as a relative
risk ratio (RRR), and has a similar interpretation as an odds
ratio (Hilbe 2009). Finally, we explored potential two-way
interactions between sex, age, and race/ethnicity.
The second series of analyses examined drug-related out-
comes. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios
(OR) associated with initiating marijuana before other sub-
stances for five dichotomous outcomes: (1) heavy cannabis
use, (2) CUD, (3) AUD, (4) ND, and (5) lifetime use of other
drugs. These models excluded youth who had never used
drugs. Adjusted models controlled for sex, age, race/ethnicity,
survey year, and the number of drugs used. Age of first mar-
ijuana use was adjusted for in models of cannabis-related out-
comes, while age of first alcohol, cigarette, and other drug use
was similarly adjusted for in models of AUD, ND, and life-
time other drug use, respectively. All analyses accounted for
the complex survey design, sampling weights, and were con-
ducted in Stata version 13.0 (StataCorp 2013).
Results
For each substance, the mean age of reported first use in-
creased over the study period. The mean age of first marijuana
use increased (+ 0.5 years) from 14.7 years in 2004 to
15.2 years in 2014; these numbers were comparable to those
for age of first use of cigarettes (13.6 vs. 15.0; + 1.4 years),
alcohol (14.4 vs. 15.2; + 0.8 years), other tobacco (14.8 vs.
Prev Sci
 15.7; + 0.9 years), and other drug use (14.4 vs. 15.0; +
0.6 years).
Aggregated across survey years, 5.8% of respondents re-
ported that they initiated marijuana before other substances,
compared to 29.8% for alcohol, 14.2% for cigarettes, 3.6% for
other tobacco products, and 5.9% other drugs (these data are
provided in online supplemental Table S1). From 2004 to
2014, the proportion who had initiated marijuana before other
substances increased from 4.4 to 8.0% (Fig. 1), declined for
those having initiated cigarettes first (21.4 to 8.9%) and in-
creased in youth having abstained from substance use (35.5 to
46.3%). Males were more likely than females to have initiated
marijuana first (7.1%) or other tobacco products first (5.7%),
whereas females were more likely than males to have initiated
cigarettes (15.2%) or alcohol first (32.0%). Considering age, a
small proportion of 12–13-year-olds (0.6%) reported initiating
marijuana before other substances, but by ages 18–19 and 20–
21-years, this proportion increased to 9.1 and 9.4%, respec-
tively. American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) (11.8%) and
Black youth (9.4%) had the highest proportion of initiating
marijuana first; White (4.6%) and Asian youth (2.5%) has
the lowest.
As shown in Table 1, males were more likely than females
to have initiated marijuana first in comparison to those not
using drugs (aRRR = 1.69), those initiating cigarettes first
(aRRR = 1.79), or those initiating alcohol first (aRRR =
1.83). Likewise, the likelihood of initiating marijuana first
relative to no drug use (aRRR = 1.69) or alcohol first
(aRRR = 1.06) increased with age, but not relative to initiating
cigarettes first. Compared to Whites, AI/AN youth were 3.7
times more likely to have initiated marijuana first relative to
no drug use, and were 5.0 times more likely to have initiated
marijuana first relative to alcohol. Notably, Black youth were
the most likely to have initiated marijuana first compared to
cigarettes (aRRR = 2.74). To a lesser extent, Hispanic, Native
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI), and multiracial
youth also had a higher likelihood of initiating marijuana be-
fore other substances compared to Whites. By contrast, Asian
youth were less likely to have initiated marijuana first relative
to no drug use (aRRR = 0.30) or alcohol first (aRRR = 0.59).
Thus, White and Asian youth were more likely to have initi-
ated cigarettes or alcohol first before other substances com-
pared to other racial/ethnic groups. Even after accounting for
these demographic characteristics, the likelihood of initiating
marijuana before other substances increased with survey year
relative to no drug use (aRRR = 1.01) or alcohol first
(aRRR = 1.07), but most strongly when compared to ciga-
rettes first (aRRR = 1.16).
In exploratory analyses, we examined subgroup interac-
tions between sex, age, and race/ethnicity in relation to having
initiated marijuana first vs. no drug use (data not in tables). We
found no subgroup interactions by sex (i.e., age x sex or race/
ethnicity x sex). However, there was less variation by race/
ethnicity among older age groups. For example, 20–21-year-
old Black youth had a similar likelihood of initiating marijua-
na first relative to Whites, but 15–16-year-old Black youth
had almost twice the likelihood (aRRR = 1.9).
Table 2 shows the degree to which initiating marijuana
before other substances is associated with the drug-related
outcomes examined, after adjustment for potential con-
founders. Generally, those who started with a particular sub-
stance were the most like to have prevalent problematic use of
that substance. For example, those who initiated marijuana
before other substances were more likely currently smoking
marijuana heavily and have CUD. Those who initiated alcohol
before other substances were the most likely to experience
prevalent AUD, and those who initiated cigarettes first were
the most likely to experience prevalent ND. However, it is
worth noting that those who initiated marijuana first were no
less likely, statistically, to have prevalent ND as compared to
those who initiated cigarettes first. Finally, youth who initiated
cigarettes or other tobacco products before other substances
were less likely than those starting with alcohol or marijuana
to have used other drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, inhalants,
and non-medical prescription drugs.
Discussion
We found that, in 2014, 8% of US youths aged 12–21-years
reported that marijuana was the first drug they used; this per-
centage has almost doubled since 2004. This increase could be
due to a concurrent decline in those starting with cigarettes
first, which dropped from about 21 to 9% over the same peri-
od. The proportion of youth initiating other tobacco products
or other drugs first also declined, but to a limited extent, and
there has been little change in the proportion of youth who
start with alcohol first, which remained the substance youth
most commonly initiate first. We also observed a significant
increase in youth abstaining from substance use altogether,
which rose from 36 to 46%, and therefore, it is unclear the
degree to which increases in those initiating marijuana first
could be due to youth abstaining or delaying cigarette
smoking (Johnson et al. 2018). Higher levels of perceived risk
for cigarettes compared to marijuana could be a contributing
factor (Berg et al. 2015; Pacek et al. 2015). Our estimate is
slightly lower than a previous estimate produced a decade ago
(Gfroerer et al. 2002); however, this prior study looked only at
those who started smoking marijuana within the last
12 months, which might overestimate the number who used
marijuana before cigarettes or alcohol.
We found that males and older youth were more likely to
start with marijuana as their first drug. Males report more
opportunities to try marijuana and are less likely to perceive
it as harmful than females, and therefore, lead to an increased
likelihood of starting with marijuana before other substances
Prev Sci
 (Pacek et al. 2015; Van Etten and Anthony 2001). We also
found that as youth aged, they were more likely to start with
marijuana as their first drug compared to no drug use or using
alcohol first. This could be explained by a number of age-
related factors, such as greater perceived availability of mari-
juana and lower perceived harm relative to cigarettes and al-
cohol at older ages (Johnston et al. 2017). There are also
important differences in the legal age of being able to purchase
cigarettes (18 years) and alcohol (21 years) which may help
explain why age was not significantly related to starting with
marijuana first compared to cigarettes.
With the exception of Asian youth, racial/ethnic minority
youth were generally more likely than White youth to start
with marijuana. American Indian or Alaskan Native youth
were the most likely to use marijuana first relative to no drug
use or using alcohol first, but Black youth were more likely to
use marijuana first compared to cigarettes first. Using data on
8th, 10th, and 12th graders in Washington state covering
roughly the same time period (2004–2016), Johnson et al.
(2018) in the present issue corroborate higher rates of past
30-day marijuana among AI/AN and Black youth. American
Indian youth perceive less disapproval from using marijuana
by their classmates and adults compared to White youth,
which might help explain our findings, is consistent with stud-
ies showing high rates of marijuana use in this group, and a
greater likelihood of AI youth using marijuana before alcohol
(Johnson et al. 2015; Novins et al. 2001; Stanley et al. 2014;
Swaim et al. 2013).
Black youth also had a greater chance of starting with mar-
ijuana than Whites, especially compared to using cigarettes or
alcohol first, which is consistent with other literature on who
uses marijuana before tobacco (Golub and Johnson 2002;
Kennedy et al. 2016; Vaughn et al. 2008; White et al. 2007).
White youth are more likely to drink, smoke cigarettes, and
start using both substances at younger ages than Blacks
(Dawson 1998; Landrine et al. 1994; Roberts et al. 2016).
Tolerance of situational norms and attitudes towards drinking
and drunkenness are also greater among White compared to

 Black youth, and White peers may exert a larger influence on
tobacco and alcohol behaviors compared to Black peers
(Caetano and Clark 1999; Gibbons et al. 2010). Black parents
are more likely than those of other races to abstain from alco-
hol use, and are also less likely to involve their children in
family alcohol use (Peterson et al. 1994). Marijuana may be
more available in Black neighborhoods and be perceived as
less stigmatizing and harmful than tobacco or alcohol, which
might make it a more socially acceptable alternative to tobac-
co and alcohol as a coping mechanism for greater victimiza-
tion, discrimination, and social stress in their environment
(Boardman and Alexander 2011; Furr-Holden et al. 2011;
Green et al. 2016; Peterson et al. 1994; Reboussin et al.
2015; Sinclair et al. 2013; Stock et al. 2011; Storr et al.
2004). However, exploratory findings reveal that these race/
ethnic differences may be more pronounced among younger
adolescents (e.g., 15–16-year-olds).
Starting with marijuana first may increase the likelihood of
heavy and problematic use. Even after accounting for demo-
graphics, age of marijuana onset, and the number of drug
used, our results showed those who initiated marijuana first
before other substances were more likely to smoke marijuana
daily or near daily and currently experience CUD. In
explaining these findings, it is possible that the substance
youth try first might positively influence their preference and
attitudes about that drug relative to others and lead them to
become persistent and dependent users of that drug sooner
than for substances that are tried later. Unfortunately, because
our data were cross-sectional, we could not fill in the gap
about youths’ substance use between their first use and
current experience. Nonetheless, this idea is consistent with
our other findings showing that those who start with alcohol
first or cigarettes first tend to be the most likely to have
prevalent AUD and ND, respectively. It is also consistent
with the finding by Sartor et al. (2013) that women who
started with marijuana before alcohol progressed more rapidly
to onset of marijuana problems than those exhibiting the re-
verse sequence.
However, our findings suggest that in terms of ND, there
may be little difference between those who start with marijua-
na and later smoke cigarettes, and vice versa. Our results
showed that that those who started with marijuana first were
statistically no less likely than those who started with ciga-
rettes first to be nicotine dependent. High levels of co-use
could be one explanation with 90% of lifetime marijuana users
reporting cigarette smoking sometime in their life (Agrawal
et al. 2012). Youth who start with marijuana may also have an
easier and quicker time transitioning to smoking tobacco com-
pared to other substances. Both drugs share a similar, and thus
familiar, route of administration and the two drugs can be
easily mixed together within a single preparation (e.g., blunts,
spliffs) (Agrawal and Lynskey 2009). As shown in the paper
by Nguyen and others in the present issue, adolescent

Prev Sci
 marijuana use increases the risk of daily cigarette smoking in
women. Once regular cigarette smoking starts, the onset of
ND symptoms can occur relatively quickly—within four
weeks according to one study (DiFranza et al. 2000)—unlike
for CUD and AUD, which may take several years to develop
(Wagner and Anthony 2002a).
We also find that those who start with marijuana or with
alcohol are equally more likely to subsequently use other
drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, inhalants, or non-medical pre-
scription drugs, compared to a lower likelihood for those who
start with cigarettes or other tobacco products. Alcohol, like
marijuana, has been implicated as a Bgateway^ drug for illegal
drug use (Kandel and Kandel 2015; Kirby and Barry 2012),
although critics point to alternative explanations for this rela-
tionship including the order in which youth have the opportu-
nity to use different drugs and the role of common liability
phenotypes (Morral et al. 2002; Vanyukov and Ridenour
2012). For example, youth who start with marijuana or alco-
hol may have more opportunities to try other illegal drugs via
increased exposure to illegal markets or drug-using peers
(Caulkins and Pacula 2006; Wagner and Anthony 2002b).
Alcohol and marijuana may also have neurocognitive effects
on adolescent brain development that impair behavioral con-
trol and lead to riskier decision-making, such as engaging in
more serious drug use (Bava and Tapert 2010).
Before further discussion of this study’s implications, these
findings should be viewed within the context of the following
limitations. First, these data are based on retrospective self-
report, and accuracy of recall for the age of substance onset
could be subject to forward telescoping bias (i.e., reporting
events as being closer in time than what is true) although it
is unclear if this bias differs by the drug, their sequence, or the
number of drugs used (Shillington et al. 2012). By restricting
the sample to 12–21-year-olds, we sought to limit issues with
recall, so as most youth would have initiated their first drug
use within the last few years. Second, we were only able to
explore prevalent outcomes associated with using marijuana
first, rather than the first onset of symptoms or disordered use,
which may conflate effects on incidence vs. duration. That is,
we cannot account for the possibility that some who start with
marijuana first may rapidly progress to heavy use, CUD, or
other outcomes, but then be in remission within the year prior
to interview when these outcomes were assessed. Third, anal-
yses of potential confounders were limited to a few time-
invariant demographic characteristics, since the NSDUH
was not designed to assess other time-invariant or time-
varying factors (e.g., parental, peer, mental health, or socio-
economic factors) present before the first drug onset, and
which might help explain both using marijuana first and relat-
ed outcomes.
We conclude by mentioning notable study strengths and
raise future implications for research, prevention, and treat-
ment. Strengths include the use of large, representative
samples and consistent methods across surveys that aided in
promoting valid, precise, and generalizable estimates of sen-
sitive behaviors, such as drug use. This paper demonstrates the
advantage of focused follow-up questions to refine the drug
onset sequence when the age of first use responses overlap.
Our findings suggest important targets for public health inter-
vention and prevention of marijuana use, especially among
American Indian/Alaska Native and Black youth, who are less
likely to have access to treatment or successful treatment out-
comes (Peters et al. 2014; Priester et al. 2016; Vendetti et al.
2002). Specifically, drug prevention strategies may need to be
better targeted to groups differently based on their risk of
initiating tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana first. To the degree
these trends continue and greater numbers of youth start with
marijuana as their first drug, there may be an increasing need
for public interventions and treatment services for marijuana-
related problems.
