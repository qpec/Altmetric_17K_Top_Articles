Lifespan Changes of the Human 
Brain In Alzheimer’s Disease

Brain imaging studies have shown that slow and progressive cerebral atrophy characterized the 
development of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Despite a large number of studies dedicated to AD, key 
questions about the lifespan evolution of AD biomarkers remain open. When does the AD model diverge 
from the normal aging model? What is the lifespan trajectory of imaging biomarkers for AD? How do the 
trajectories of biomarkers in AD differ from normal aging? To answer these questions, we proposed an 
innovative way by inferring brain structure model across the entire lifespan using a massive number of 
MRI (N = 4329). We compared the normal model based on 2944 control subjects with the pathological 
model based on 3262 patients (AD + Mild cognitive Impaired subjects) older than 55 years and controls 
younger than 55 years. Our study provides evidences of early divergence of the AD models from the 
normal aging trajectory before 40 years for the hippocampus, followed by the lateral ventricles and 
the amygdala around 40 years. Moreover, our lifespan model reveals the evolution of these biomarkers 
and suggests close abnormality evolution for the hippocampus and the amygdala, whereas trajectory 
of ventricular enlargement appears to follow an inverted U-shape. Finally, our models indicate that 
medial temporal lobe atrophy and ventricular enlargement are two mid-life physiopathological events 
characterizing AD brain.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in persons older than 65 years1. Cognitive 
impairment, mainly related to memory deficits, is the most common manifestation of this disease2. Available 
neuroimaging evidence suggests that the neuropathological alterations underlying AD probably begin much ear-
lier than the appearance of clinical symptoms and years before clinical diagnosis3. From these results, it appeared 
that the pharmacological management was finally implemented in patients with a largely advanced neurode-
generative process, making it difficult to fight against pathological progression. In this context, the concept of 
disease-modifying therapies is emerging and the search for early biomarkers of these alterations is currently a hot 
topic of research4.
Neurodegeneration, assessed by the level of cerebral atrophy, is one of these biomarkers. In recent decades, 
several MRI studies have investigated neurodegeneration in the prodromal phase of Alzheimer’s disease5,6. 
However, very few of them attempted to investigate the preclinical phase of the disease, the very early asympto-
matic phase. Indeed, this type of study is a very challenging task since it requires an imaging database starting 
before the appearance of the disease, and the corresponding long follow-up study. Therefore, in the past, such 
studies have been based on subjects with rare autosomal dominant mutations associated with a high risk of devel-
oping dementia7–10 or on longitudinal studies with long follow-up in which brain imaging have been performed 
before the appearance of clinical symptoms (i.e., memory impairment)11–13. In these previous long follow-up 
studies, the starting point of the neurodegeneration was not determined since incident cases already present brain 
morphometric differences at baseline 7 or 10 years before the diagnosis13–15 or 5 before the apparition of Mild 
Cognitive Impairment (MCI)16. Finally, the lifespan evolution of these imaging biomarkers many years before 
cognitive decline also remains unknown.
Determining the timing of the onset of neurodegeneration would require longitudinal MRI datasets with 
several decades of follow-up. So far, due to obvious technical reasons, such imaging dataset does not exist yet. 
Consequently, in this paper, we propose to consider alternative questions such as – When does the AD model 
diverge from the normal aging model? How do the trajectories of biomarker models differ in AD from normal

aging? To answer these questions, we present an innovative approach based on an extrapolated lifespan model of 
AD brain structures using large-scale databases. To this end, we propose to take advantage of the new paradigm of 
BigData sharing in neuroimaging17 by analyzing publically available databases including subjects from a wide age 
range covering the entire lifespan. Such analysis can be very valuable since epidemiological studies indicate that 
late dementia is associated with early exposure to risk factors at midlife, highlighting the need to consider brain 
biomarkers throughout the entire lifespan18–20.
Recently, we used BigData approach to propose an analysis of brain trajectory across the entire lifespan using 
N = 2944 MRI of cognitively normal subjects (CN)21. Herein, we present a study following a similar approach to 
analyze the lifespan changes of the human brain in AD. To this end, we propose to build an extrapolated model of 
AD for brain structures. We assume that the neurodegenerative process is slow and progressive. The slow accu-
mulation of Amyloid-β
3,22,23 and the smooth atrophy of brain3,10 seem to indicate that brain alterations occurs pro-
gressively in AD. Accordingly, to build our lifespan AD model we combined young CN with aged AD and MCI 
patients. We used 1385 MRI of AD and MCI patients (from 55 y to 96 y) and 1877 MRI of CN subjects younger 
than them (from 9 months to 55 y). In our approach, we used CN subjects as young asymptomatic AD subjects to 
overcome the absence of datasets including young CN who will develop AD several decades latter. However, MRI 
studies have showed brain alterations several years before diagnosis or MCI stage14–16. Therefore, the proposed 
approach can be viewed as a conservative lifespan model of AD. In this study, we first propose a comparison of 
lifespan evolution of global white and gray matter and subcortical structures between AD sample and CN sample. 
Afterward, we focus on temporal lobe structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala – known to be affected 
in AD24,25 and the lateral ventricles, also a known AD biomarker26,27 in a supplementary analysis considering 
three pathological models: an AD model composed of 2303 subjects, an MCI model composed of 2836 samples 
subjects and an AD/MCI model composed of 3262 subjects.
Material and Methods
Groups definition. 
This study aims at comparing normal and pathological models of brain structure across 
the entire lifespan. To this end, models were estimated on four different groups to generate CN, AD/MCI, AD 
and MCI trajectories.
• 
For the CN model, we used the N = 2944 subjects from 9 months to 94 y of the cognitively normal dataset as 
done in21.
• 
For the AD/MCI model, we used N = 3262 subjects. We mixed AD patients, with MCI patients and with 
young CN considered as presymptomatic subjects. We used 426 AD patients (from 55 y to 96 y), 959 MCI 
patients (from 55 y to 92 y) of the AD/MCI dataset and all the CN younger than 55 y (i.e., 1877 subjects). 
These subjects are included in the CN used for CN trajectory.
• 
For the AD model, we used N = 2303 samples. We mixed AD patients with young CN. More precisely, we 
used 426 AD patients (from 55 y to 96 y) of the AD/MCI datasets and all the CN younger than 55 y (i.e., 1877 
subjects).
• 
For the MCI model, we used N = 2836 samples. Here, 959 MCI patients (from 55 y to 92 y) of the AD/MCI 
datasets were mixed with all the CN younger than 55 y (i.e., 1877 subjects).
Datasets description. 
To study structural changes across the entire lifespan for CN and AD, we aggre-
gated several open access databases to construct two datasets. In the following, CN and AD/MCI datasets will be 
described. The four previously described groups are built on these datasets.
Cognitively normal dataset (N = 2944). The cognitively normal dataset is composed of the 3296 T1-weighted 
(T1w) MRI. The composition of the nine open access databases used to build the control dataset is provided in 
Table 1. As explained in21, after a quality control (see image processing section), only 2944 MRI were kept. The 
female proportion is 47% for the remaining subjects and the age range is [0.75–94] years.
AD/MCI dataset (N = 1385). The AD/MCI dataset is composed of 426 AD patients and 959 MCI patients 
extracted from OASIS, AIBL, ADNI1 and ADNI2 databases. Details on clinical criterion for groups definition 
are provided in28 for ADNI1, ADNI2 and AIBL and in29 for OASIS. After a quality control, only 1385 MRI were 
kept. The female proportion is 44% for the remaining subjects and the age range is [55–96] years (see Table 2).

Image processing. 
All the considered images were processed with the volBrain pipeline30 (http://volbrain.
upv.es). The volBrain system is a web-based online tool providing automatic brain segmentation and generating 
report summarizing the volumetric results. The full processing time is around 10 minutes. In the past 2 years, vol-
Brain has processed online more than 75.000 brains for approximately 1800 users. In a recent work, we compared 
volBrain pipeline with two well-known tools used on MR brain analysis (FSL and Freesurfer). We showed signifi-
cant improvements in terms of both accuracy and reproducibility for intra and inter-scanner scan-rescan acquisi-
tions30. The volBrain processing pipeline includes several steps to improve the quality of the input MR images and 
to homogenize their contrast and intensity range30. The volBrain pipeline achieves the following preprocessing 
steps: (1) denoising using spatially adaptive non-local means31, (2) rough inhomogeneity correction using N4 
method32, (3) affine registration to MNI152 space using ANTS software33, (4) SPM based fine inhomogeneity 
correction34 and (5) tissue based intensity standardization35. After preprocessing, the brain is segmented into 
several structures at different scales. First, the total intracranial volume (TIV) is obtained with NICE method36. 
Then, tissue classification is performed using the TMS method35 and finally subcortical structures are estimated 
using the non-local label fusion method37. All the segmentation methods of volBrain are based on a library of 50 
experts manually labelled cases (covering almost the entire lifespan). It is worth to note that the used manual hip-
pocampus labeling followed the EADC-ADNI harmonized protocol which is the current consensus protocol for 
hippocampus segmentation in AD38. More details about volBrain pipeline can be found in30. Finally, a multi-stage 
quality control (QC) procedure was performed to carefully select subjects included. First, a visual assessment was 
done for all input images by checking screen shots of one sagittal, one coronal and one axial slice in middle of the 
3D volume. Then, a visual assessment of processing quality was carried out by using the volBrain report which 
provides screenshots for each step of the pipeline. Finally, a last control was performed by individually checking 
with a 3D viewer all outliers detected using the estimated model (see21 for more details).
statistical Analysis. 
Different model types were considered to estimate the final model of each structure. 
The candidate models were tested from the simplest to the most complex. A model type was kept as a potential 
candidate only when simultaneously F-statistic based on ANOVA (i.e., model vs. constant model) was significant 
(p < 0.05) and when all its coefficients were significant using t-statistic (p < 0.05). As in21, the following model 
types were used as potential candidates:

To select the best model type, we used the Bayesian Information Criterion among kept candidate models – 
p < 0.05 for ANOVA of the model vs. constant model and p < 0.05 for T-test of all the coefficients. The Bayesian 
information criterion is a measure providing a trade-off between bias and variance to select the model explaining 
most of the data with a minimum number of parameters. Moreover, to compensate for variability introduced by 
head size difference, models were estimated on normalized volume in % of total intracranial volume. Left and 
right volumes were added to obtain the final volume structure. The prediction bounds were estimated with a con-
fidence level at 95%. This model selection procedure was applied to all the considered structures. In this study, we 
studied the following brain structures: lateral ventricles, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, accumbens, 
globus pallidus and thalamus. Moreover, tissue classification was used to obtain the global volume of white matter 
and gray matter. All statistical tests were performed with Matlab© using default parameters. Afterwards, percent-
age of relative rate of change per year and percentage of abnormality were computed on the estimated models. 
The relative rate of change in percentage per year was computed as the first derivative of the model divided by the 
model39 and the abnormality in percentage as the absolute difference between pathological models and control 
model divided by control model (i.e., absolute relative difference compared to control).
Finally, we studied lifespan classification accuracy of several AD biomarkers. To this end, for each age, a 
classification was performed with a linear discriminate analysis (LDA) using all the samples in an interval of 
10 y (i.e.,+/−
 5 years). We used Area Under the Curve (AUC) as classification performance metric. The AUC

was estimated through a cross-validation procedure based on a repeated K-fold using 10 iterations and 10-fold. 
Finally, the average AUC obtained over the 10 repetitions is reported for all ages. Classification experiments were 
performed with Matlab© using default parameters.
Results
Figure 1 presents models of all considered structures for AD/MCI and CN groups. This figure shows that hip-
pocampus and amygdala models present marked divergences between AD/MCI and CN, and also indicates that 
this divergence increases with age. Moreover, the divergence of control and pathological models for these struc-
tures occurs early around 40–45 y. Lateral ventricles also exhibit early divergence – starting around 42 y – between 
both models, however the distance between models decreases at advanced ages. Similarly, the thalamus presents 
an early but weak divergence that decreases at advanced ages. Pathological models of caudate and accumbens 
nuclei exhibit accelerated volume decreases from 50–60 y. However, confidence intervals for these structures over-
lap again after 85 y (see Table 3). For white matter and gray matter, AD/MCI models present an early accelerated 
aging compared to CN models around 45 y. However, after 80 y, CN models of brain tissues show an accelerated 
volume decreases. Consequently, confidence intervals of pathological and normal models overlap after 85 years 
(see Table 3). Finally, normal and pathological models for globus pallidus and putamen present similar trends.
Table 3 shows the age ranges where the confidence interval of the predicted pathological models (i.e., AD, MCI 
and AD/MCI) do not overlap with the confidence interval of the control models.
First, only hippocampus and amygdala models present non-overlapping confidence intervals after divergence 
for all the studied pathological modes (i.e., AD/MCI, AD and MCI) (see Table 3). This is also valid for lateral

group (N = 2944) is in black and model for AD/MCI group (N = 3262) is in red. The prediction bounds of the 
models are estimated with a confidence level at 95%.

ventricles model but only when using the AD group. For all other considered structures, predicted confidence 
intervals overlap again at advanced ages around 80–90 y.
Second, hippocampus is the deep gray structure showing the earliest model divergence at 39 y for AD/MCI, 
37 y for AD and 42 y for MCI. Then, the lateral ventricles models exhibit a divergence at 42 y for AD/MCI, 39 y 
for AD and 45 y for MCI. Afterwards, thalamus models diverge from control at 43 y for AD/MCI, 42 y for AD 
and 45 y for MCI. The divergence of amygdala models occurs at 44 y for AD/MCI, 41 y for AD and 49 y for MCI. 
Impact on global gray matter and white matter volume is observed later, with models diverging at 45 y and 48 y 
respectively for AD/MCI, at 46 y and 47 y respectively for AD and at 58 y and 54 y respectively for MCI. Finally, 
accumbens and caudate models diverge slightly later, but in a similar age range. Putamen and globus pallidus are 
the only deep gray matter structures for which models do not diverge from CN across the entire lifespan. Indeed, 
as assessed in Fig. 1, the confidence intervals of normal and pathological models always overlap.
To further analyze well-known AD biomarkers, we propose a second analysis focusing on the hippocampus, 
the lateral ventricles and the amygdala. Figure 2 presents the lifespan models of these structures for CN, AD and 
MCI groups. Moreover, relative rate of change and abnormality percentages are provided.
First, divergence points of the models occur earlier for AD than for MCI (see Table 3 for exact time). As 
expected, models for MCI are in between AD and CN ones. Second, when using relative rate of change, amygdala 
and lateral ventricle exhibit a more pronounced relative rate of change compared to hippocampus. The maximum 
relative rate of changes for AD models of these structures are −
3.6%/y for AG at 96 y, −
2.1%/y for hippocampus 
at 96 y and 3.4%/y at 42 y for lateral ventricles. Contrary to hippocampus and amygdala, which show an increas-
ing relative rate of change with age, lateral ventricles exhibits enlargement following an inverted U-shape. When 
considering abnormality percentage, an earlier abnormality increase is observed for hippocampus than for lateral 
ventricles and amygdala. This abnormality reaches a maximum of 32% for the AD model at 96 y. Abnormality 
appears later in life for lateral ventricles and amygdala and follows very different patterns for both. The lateral 
ventricles abnormality follows an inverted U-shape with a maximum of 47% at 63 y for the AD model. The amyg-
dala abnormality has similar trend to that of the hippocampus abnormality. Amygdala volume reaches 40% of 
abnormality at 96 y for the AD model. Therefore, while hippocampus abnormality starts first, amygdala presents 
a greater abnormality at advanced age. Moreover, the abnormality observed in lateral ventricles is also important 
but its maximum is reached at 65 y. Afterwards, percentage of abnormality of lateral ventricles decreases to end at 
19% at 96 y for the AD model. Therefore, at late age, the lateral ventricles show lower abnormalities than those of 
the hippocampus and the amygdala at the same ages.
Finally, we propose a third analysis to estimate classification performance of the studied AD biomarkers 
according to the period of life. In the past, a large number of studies has been dedicated to AD patient classifi-
cation for computer-aided diagnosis purpose5,40–45. In such studies, the classification performance of different 
biomarkers/features is compared to estimate their capability to distinguish patients from control subjects46–48. 
However, the evolution of the classification performance according to the period of life has not been studied. 
Therefore, we propose to estimate classification accuracy of hippocampus, lateral ventricles and amygdala vol-
umes across the lifespan. Figure 3 presents the evolution of AUC across lifespan.
First, we can notice that the evolution of classification performance based on hippocampus and amygdala 
volumes are similar for the AD population with a plateau around 89% of AUC starting at 72 y. In contrast, for 
the MCI population, AUC trajectory of both regions does not behave similarly. Indeed, AUC increases faster and 
earlier for hippocampus volume than for amygdala volume. However, at the end, AUC trajectory for both regions 
converge to similar maximum around 73% at 80 y for hippocampus and around 72% at 80 y for amygdala. These 
AUC values are in line with literature dedicated to automatic classification of patients40,45. Finally, AUC based on 
lateral ventricles follows an inverted U-shape for AD population with a maximum of 76% around 65 y. For the 
MCI population, AUC shows a plateau around 60% from 60 y to 80 y.

Discussion
In this paper, we investigate lifespan changes of the human brain in Alzheimer’s disease. The main novelty of this 
work is to propose pathological trajectory of brain structure over the entire lifespan. Consequently, it is possible to 
Figure 2. Hippocampus, lateral ventricles and amygdala models for CN, AD and MCI groups. The relative 
volumes (% total intracranial volume) are displayed according to the age in years across the entire lifespan. 
The prediction bounds are estimated with a confidence level at 95%. Relative rate of change is based on the first 
derivative of the model divided by the model and provided in % per year. Finally, percentage of abnormality (i.e. 
absolute relative difference compared to control) is estimated as the absolute difference between CN model and 
AD or MCI models divided by CN model. The model for CN group (N = 2944) is displayed in black, the model 
for MCI group (N = 2836) is displayed in yellow and the model for AD group (N = 2303) is displayed in red.

estimate when our normal and pathological models diverge. Moreover, our models enable to follow the dynamic 
of biomarker abnormality over the entire evolution of the pathology.
Our lifespan analysis using inferred models of brain trajectory in AD indicates that the hippocampus is the 
brain structure that exhibits the earliest divergence between cognitively normal model and pathological model. 
This model divergence is detectable early in life, at 39 y for the AD/MCI and at 37 y for the AD. The hippocampus 
model shares similar trends with another temporal lobe region, the amygdala, which presents model divergence 
at 44 y for AD/MCI and at 40 y for AD. It is noticeable that amygdala model is undergoing larger changes propor-
tionally to its size compared to hippocampus. Finally, the lateral ventricles model presents an early divergence 
at 42 y for AD/MCI and at 39 y for AD. However, lateral ventricles enlargement occurring during normal aging 
reduces the abnormality of this structure after 60 y. Finally, the thalamus model shows early divergence at 43 y for 
AD/MCI and at 42 y for AD.
Our results presenting the hippocampus model as the first brain region diverging from normal aging model 
is in accordance with previous morphometric studies focused on the prodromal phase of the disease12–15,49,50. It 
is also in accordance with histopathological studies showing the temporal lobe as the starting point of the neu-
rodegenerative process in AD51. In long follow-up studies, authors observed that incident cases of AD present 
morphometric difference in the hippocampus at least 10 years before the diagnosis13,14,21. Hippocampal atrophy 
has also been reported in several different transgenic mouse models of AD52, such as the amyloid precursor 
protein/presenilin2/Tau model, in which the volume reduction progresses with the pathology53, and it is associ-
ated with an enlargement of the lateral ventricles. In vivo MRI-measure of grey matter atrophy in AD has been 
described as a surrogate of the amount of neurofibrillary tangle revealed by post-mortem immunohistochemistry 
in human54. As this observation has been done in aging AD-diagnosed subjects, we could not ascertain that the 
mid-life atrophy revealed by our model is the result of the same Tau-pathophysiological process. Nevertheless, 
some recent studies revealed that temporal grey matter atrophy is associated to temporal Tau accumulation55,56 
in clinically normal subjects. Moreover, a part of the effects of Tau accumulation on cognition is mediated by the 
temporal grey matter atrophy. On the other side, amyloid burden would be an independent aggravating factor of 
the process impacting temporal lobe regions, with an additive effect on cognition57. In fact, amyloid deposition 
in healthy elderly subjects, measured by the Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography, has been 
shown in a longitudinal study to be associated with later hippocampal atrophy and memory impairment58. All 
these results indicate that AD results from the cooccurrence of different pathological process, partially inde-
pendent from each other and presenting different time course depending on the interplay between genetic and 
environmental factors. The time relationship between the different neuroimaging biomarkers is currently the 
subject of intensive research to describe early pathophysiological process associated to the disease. In addition 
to the atrophy and the Tauopathy, AD brain presents amyloid deposition. During the asymptomatic phase of the 
disease these biomarkers could be concomitantly or separately observed in vivo, leading to a proposed Amyloid/
Tau/Neurodegeneration classification scheme to describe subjects during this silent phase59.
According to our results, the second structure of temporal lobe region diverging from the cognitively normal 
model is the amygdala, which is different from CN at 40 y for AD and at 44 y for MCI/AD. Atrophy of this struc-
ture has been repeatedly described in AD subjects, with a rate of change less important than60,61 or similar to24 the 
hippocampal one. In our model, we found that the time course of volume evolution of the amygdala is very closed 
to the one of the hippocampus. Importantly, after divergence, AD and CN models of the hippocampus and amyg-
dala volumes never overlap across lifespan, in contrast to other deep gray matter structures models investigated 
in this study. This result highlights the specificity all along life of the medial temporal lobe alteration associated 
to the mnesic symptoms, which characterize the disease. The early reduction of amygdala volume has also been 
observed in the transgenic mouse model APPswe/PS1dE9 of AD, where neurodegeneration in the amygdala even 
precedes that found in the hippocampus62. The early divergence of the amygdala in the AD model is not surpris-
ing when considering the implication of emotion in memory. Indeed, the activity of basolateral and lateral nuclei 
of the amygdala is associated to a facilitation during the encoding phase and to an enhanced retrieval, these effects 
being mediated through the important interconnections between these structures and the hippocampus63. In 
addition, degradation of emotion processing ability is also observed in AD patients, as expected given the amyg-
dala atrophy64. Moreover, the atrophy of the amygdala is likely contributing to the olfactory deficits associated 
with AD, since the cortical nuclei of the AG are associated with the processing of olfactory stimuli65. Hyposmia 
has been described in AD66, and olfactory deficits can substantially precede cognitive symptoms67,68. However, it 
has to be taken into account that pathological alterations in AD occur also in other olfactory structures69,70.
Based on our study, the volume of the lateral ventricles is also an early biomarker of AD, since its model 
diverges at 42 y for AD/MCI and at 39 y for AD. The potential of using lateral ventricles volume as AD biomarkers 
has been previously mentioned over restricted periods27,71. In this study, by analyzing the lifespan evolution of 
lateral ventricles abnormality, we showed that lateral ventricles abnormality decreases after 65 y. Therefore, the 
use of this biomarker is difficult for the late onset cases due to important lateral ventricles enlargement occurring 
during normal aging. However, it may be useful to discriminate cases around 65 y, an early age at which the AD 
diagnosis is particularly relevant because future potential treatment could be more effective in the early phases of 
the disease72. The importance of taking into account volume increase at advanced age in normal aging has been 
previously mentioned26. In the present study, early divergence of the models has been also observed for thalamus 
around 42 y. Thalamic atrophy was previously reported in AD literature73,74. However, we found that thalamus 
abnormality was very small (4.6% at 81 y). This may explain why only a small number of studies have mentioned 
that this structure could be affected by AD, because a large number of subjects are needed to detect such subtle 
atrophy.
In this study, to overcome the absence of longitudinal datasets with several decades of follow-up, we processed 
a massive number of cross-sectional MRI to generate a model of the volume trajectory in several brain structures 
in AD across the entire lifespan. We acknowledge that the use of cross-sectional data to analyze a dynamic process 
 9

is not optimal. However, previous studies demonstrated that cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches produce 
similar age-related patterns in normal aging75 and similar models in AD76. Compared to previous longitudinal 
investigations, our results based on cross-sectional models are consistent with most previous findings on the 
importance and timing of hippocampus, amygdala and lateral ventricles alterations27,77,78. Although different 
in nature, it can be interesting to compare relative rates of change obtained with our models and annual rates of 
atrophy estimated on longitudinal data. The obtained values for relative rates of change are at the lower bound 
of expected range of annual atrophy rate reported in previous longitudinal literature77,79,80. However, our relative 
rates of change fits very well with the longitudinal rate of atrophy recently estimated with a multi-atlas method 
known to provide a less biased estimation81.
With respect to the estimated point of divergence between the CN and AD models, there is no longitudinal or 
cross-sectional MRI-based study literature over the lifetime with which to compare. However, our estimated point 
of divergence between models can be put into perspective with the detection of first AD signs in long follow-up 
longitudinal studies. First, prospective and longitudinal studies dedicated to autosomal dominant AD detected 
hippocampal atrophy up to 15 years before symptom onset10. Moreover, long follow-up population-based studies 
tracking cognition estimated that declines start from few years up to several decades before AD diagnosis82–85. 
Therefore, these results seem to confirm the presence of a long-lasting period of silence in AD, as discussed in86. 
Our models indicate that the age of 40 y is a critical period in the onset of the temporal lobe alteration. Midlife 
lifestyle factors such as diet20, physical activity87 and exposure to risk factors88 are associated with the risk of devel-
oping late life dementia; the life style factors of this critical period may specifically impact hippocampus leading 
to an increase vulnerability to dementia19. Consequently, exposure to risk factors (such as diabetes and smoking) 
occurring at this lifetime period should be considered in future studies to evaluate their implication in the early 
atrophy process.
We also proposed a classification analysis in order to highlight the importance of considering lifespan trajec-
tory when evaluating biomarker performance. While most of the studies dedicated to automatic patient classifi-
cation present only a global accuracy, our experience shows that biomarker efficiency changes according to the 
period of life. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis study should test the accuracy of the biomarker at different 
time points.
Finally, our pathological model present three main limitations. First, we used normal control for the period 
[0–55] years. However, there is no alternative to simulate the AD model before 55 years. Second, by mixing AD 
and MCI subjects in the same model, we included false positive subjects in the pathological model since we do 
know that only a part of the MCI subjects will develop AD. However, we have also analyzed the AD and MCI 
models separately for the most relevant structures. Finally, in our model we consider that brain alteration caused 
by AD is a progressive and smooth phenomenon. The transition from CN to AD over the lifespan is viewed as a 
continuum. Such approach is not well-suited if brain modifications occurs suddenly. However, evidences such 
as slow accumulation of Amyloid-β
3,22,23 or smooth and progressive atrophy of brain3,10 seem to assess that brain 
alterations occurs smoothly and progressively in AD.
Conclusion
In this work, to analyze when AD brain model diverges from the cognitively normal model we build extrapolated 
lifespan models of AD brain structures by combining multiple large-scale databases. We found an early diver-
gence of AD model from control model for hippocampus before 40 y followed by lateral ventricles and amygdala 
around 40 y. Moreover, we observed a similar abnormality evolution for the hippocampus and the amygdala. 
Finally, the model of ventricular enlargement shows that the volume of lateral ventricles reaches a peak of abnor-
mality at 65 y before decreasing due to important enlargement in normal aging.
