SUMMARY
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women causes
intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abor-
tion, and microcephaly. Here, we describe two mouse
models of placental and fetal disease associated with
in utero transmission of ZIKV. Female mice lacking
type I interferon signaling (Ifnar1�/�) crossed to
wild-type (WT) males produced heterozygous fe-
tuses resembling the immune status of human fe-
tuses. Maternal inoculation at embryonic day 6.5
(E6.5) or E7.5 resulted in fetal demise that was asso-
ciated with ZIKV infection of the placenta and fetal
brain. We identified ZIKV within trophoblasts of the
maternal and fetal placenta, consistent with a trans-
placental infection route. Antibody blockade of
Ifnar1 signaling in WT pregnant mice enhanced
ZIKV trans-placental infection although it did not
result in fetal death. These models will facilitate the
study of ZIKV pathogenesis, in utero transmission,
and testing of therapies and vaccines to prevent
congenital malformations.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that was
first isolated from a febrile rhesus macaque in Uganda in 1947
and is related to other globally relevant arthropod-transmitted
human pathogens including dengue (DENV), yellow fever
(YFV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and tick-
borne encephalitis viruses (Lazear and Diamond, 2016). Over
the last decade, ZIKV has emerged from a relatively obscure sta-
tus to causing large epidemics in Micronesia, French Polynesia,
and South and Central America. Although in most instances ZIKV
infection results in a self-limiting febrile illness associated with
rash and conjunctivitis, severe neurological phenotypes can
occur, including Guillain-Barre syndrome and meningoencepha-
litis (Carteaux et al., 2016; Oehler et al., 2014). Infection in preg-
nant women is of major concern, as it is linked to catastrophic
fetal abnormalities including microcephaly, spontaneous abor-
tion, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to placental
insufficiency (Brasil et al., 2016). Because of the growing public
health concern, there is an urgent need to establish animal
models of intrauterine ZIKV infection that define mechanisms
of fetal transmission and facilitate testing of therapeutics and
vaccines. Furthermore, an in utero animal model of ZIKV infec-
tion would establish causality and satisfy the criteria for proof
of teratogenicity (Rasmussen et al., 2016).
In 2015, Brazil experienced a sharp rise in the number of cases
of pregnancy-associated microcephaly, and this was linked to a
concurrent epidemic of ZIKV infection. Mounting evidence sug-
gests that ZIKV infection in pregnant women causes congenital
abnormalities and fetal demise (Brasil et al., 2016; Sarno et al.,
2016; Ventura et al., 2016). Initial case descriptions of micro-
cephaly and spontaneous abortion have been bolstered by
evidence of viral RNA and antigen in the brains of congenitally in-
fected fetuses and newborns (Martines et al., 2016; Mlakar et al.,
2016). These findings were substantiated by a prospective study
of a cohort of symptomatic, ZIKV-infected pregnant women in
which 29% of fetuses exhibited developmental abnormalities
including microcephaly and IUGR, which in a subset of cases re-
sulted in fetal demise or stillbirth (Brasil et al., 2016). Preliminary
reports suggest that ZIKV-induced fetal abnormalities can occur
in all trimesters of pregnancy although the most severe manifes-
tations are associated with infections in the first and second tri-
mesters (Brasil et al., 2016). Congenital abnormalities associated
with ZIKV infection also have been described in French Polyne-
sia (by retrospective analysis) and other Latin American coun-
tries (Cauchemez et al., 2016). These findings suggest that
ZIKV strains in French Polynesia and Latin America share the
potential to cause disease during pregnancy.
Recently, we and others have developed models of ZIKV path-
ogenesis in adult mice that recapitulated several features of hu-
man disease (Aliota et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016; Rossi et al.,
Cell 165, 1081–1091, May 19, 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc.
1081
 2016). Whereas 4- to 6-week-old wild-type (WT) mice did not
develop overt clinical illness after infection with a contemporary
clinical strain of ZIKV, mice lacking the ability to produce or
respond to type I interferon (IFN) (e.g., Ifnar1�/� mice) developed
severe neurological disease that was associated with high viral
loads in the brain and spinal cord and substantial lethality. In a
complementary approach using WT mice treated with a blocking
anti-ifnar antibody (MAR1-5A3), we reported a less severe model
of ZIKV pathogenesis that also resulted in replication of ZIKV in
several organs (Lazear et al., 2016). These animals, however,
survived infection and did not develop neurological signs or neu-
roinvasive disease.
Given the urgent need to understand the basis for in utero
transmission of ZIKV and its pathological consequences, we
developed two models of ZIKV infection during pregnancy using
Ifnar1�/� females crossed to WT males as well as pregnant WT
females treated with an anti-ifnar-blocking antibody. We found
that ZIKV infects pregnant dams and the placenta, and this re-
sulted in damage to the placental barrier and infection of the
developing fetus, as well as placental insufficiency and IUGR.
In severe cases, ZIKV infection of Ifnar1�/� females led to fetal
demise. When dams were treated with an anti-ifnar antibody,
infection of the developing fetus occurred but was less severe
and did not cause fetal death. These findings establish models
for studying mechanisms of in utero transmission and testing
of candidate therapies for preventing congenital malformations.
They also highlight the concern that ZIKV infection can occur in
fetuses of otherwise healthy-appearing dams with uncertain
neurodevelopmental consequences.
RESULTS
Since the type I interferon (IFN) response prevents efficient repli-
cation of ZIKV in peripheral organs of WT mice (Lazear et al.,
2016), we initially used Ifnar1�/� mice to facilitate high levels of
ZIKV replication during pregnancy. Ifnar1�/� female mice were
bred with WT males so that resulting fetuses would be heterozy-
gous (Ifnar1+/�) and thus exhibit a largely intact type I IFN
signaling response. In parallel, we developed a second model
of ZIKV infection during pregnancy by treating WT pregnant
dams with an anti-ifnar-blocking antibody 1 day prior to infection
(Figure 1A). Both sets of pregnant mice were inoculated via a
subcutaneous route in the footpad with 103 focus forming units
(FFU) of a clinical isolate from French Polynesia (H/PF/2013)
that was passaged in Vero cells. This ZIKV strain is at least
97% identical at the nucleotide level to the sequence of an
epidemic strain of ZIKV in Brazil (Calvet et al., 2016; Faria
et al., 2016). We confirmed the sequence of our ZIKV H/PF/
2013 stock by next-generation sequencing (data not shown),
which also allowed us to exclude the presence of adventitious
pathogens.
In the Ifnar1�/� model, pregnant dams mated with WT mice
were inoculated on embryonic days 6.5 (E6.5) and E7.5 and
sacrificed on E13.5 and E15.5, respectively (Figure 1A). To mini-
mize confounding effects of maternal illness on fetal viability, we
evaluated pregnant Ifnar1�/� mice prior to the onset of disease,
which is characterized by hunched posture, fur ruffling, or hind-
limb paralysis (Lazear et al., 2016). Individual fetuses were eval-
uated morphologically for size and appearance by measuring the
crown-rump length and the occipito-frontal diameter of the fetal
head, the latter of which establishes microcephaly in human
fetuses (Chervenak et al., 1987; Staples et al., 2016). By E13.5,
the majority of ZIKV-infected Ifnar1+/� heterozygous fetuses
had undergone fetal demise and been resorbed, leaving only a
placental remnant (Figures 1B, upper, and 1C). The remaining
intact Ifnar1+/� fetuses exhibited significant IUGR (60.2 mm2
versus 48.7 mm2, p < 0.0001, Figure 1D). In ZIKV-infected preg-
nant
women,
multiple
phenotypes
have
been
described
including fetal demise, IUGR, and microcephaly (Brasil et al.,
2016; Sarno et al., 2016). Although we did not observe isolated
microcephaly in this in utero model of ZIKV infection, several
other abnormalities were visible in ZIKV-infected Ifnar1+/� fe-
tuses, including pallor and foci of necrotic tissue in the placenta
(Figure 1B).
To determine whether direct infection of the placenta and fetus
occurred, we measured ZIKV RNA levels by quantitative real-
time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) as well as infectious virus by plaque
assay. High levels of viral RNA and infectious virus were detected
within the placenta and also within the fetus head by E13.5 (Fig-
ures 1E and 1F and Figures S1A and S1B). As seen with the fe-
tuses from dams infected on E6.5, ZIKV inoculation on E7.5 also
resulted in fetal demise and resorption by E15.5 as well as
growth restriction (141.8 mm2 versus 79.5 mm2, p < 0.0001, Fig-
ure 1H) and pallor (Figure 1B) of intact fetuses. As expected from
prior studies with Ifnar1�/� males (Lazear et al., 2016; Rossi
et al., 2016), high levels of ZIKV were present in the blood,
spleen, and brain of Ifnar1�/� dams at day 7 after infection (Fig-
ures 1I–1K). Of note, the amount of ZIKV RNA within the placenta
was �1,000-fold greater than in maternal serum (Figures 1F and
1I), suggesting that ZIKV replicates preferentially within this
tissue.
In our second model of ZIKV infection during pregnancy, WT
mice were treated with MAR1-5A3, a blocking anti-ifnar mono-
clonal antibody (Sheehan et al., 2006), on E5.5, inoculated
with ZIKV on E6.5 or E7.5, and fetuses were analyzed on
E13.5 or E15.5, respectively (Figure 1A). Although demise was
not observed, fetuses exhibited evidence of IUGR compared
to control mAb-treated and mock-infected animals (62.3 mm2
versus 50.2 mm2, p < 0.005), albeit to a lesser extent than
seen in Ifnar1+/� animals (Figure 1D). In contrast, anti-ifnar
mAb-treated mice inoculated subcutaneously with 103 FFU of
a clinical DENV serotype 3 (DENV-3) isolate that replicates in
mice (Pinto et al., 2015; Sarathy et al., 2015) did not exhibit ev-
idence of placental or fetal infection by qRT-PCR or signs of
IUGR (Figure 1D and data not shown). These results suggest
that ZIKV may have greater tropism for placental cells than other
flaviviruses.
The levels of ZIKV RNA detected in WT fetuses were affected
by the dose of anti-ifnar mAb administered, with the greatest
amounts of ZIKV RNA present in fetuses receiving 2 or 3 mgs
of anti-ifnar mAb (Figure 1E). ZIKV RNA persisted in the anti-ifnar
mAb-treated fetal heads and bodies at least through E16.5 (Fig-
ures S1C and S1D), a critical time in early development of the
mouse brain. The placentas in both the Ifnar1�/� and anti-ifnar
antibody models exhibited higher levels of infection than the fetal
tissues, and ZIKV RNA accumulation in the placenta was

 independent of the anti-ifnar mAb dose above 0.5 mg (Figure 1F).
In comparison, mice treated with the isotype control antibody
sustained low levels or no detectable ZIKV infection in the
placenta, fetal heads or maternal tissues (Figure 1E, 1F, and
1I–1K). Collectively, these data suggest that the mouse placenta
is vulnerable to infection with ZIKV, and that high-grade infection
may cause placental insufficiency, IUGR, and fetal demise, at
least in Ifnar1+/� animals. Anti-ifnar mAb-treated animals sus-
tained less infection and no enhanced lethality although a mild
IUGR phenotype was observed.
We evaluated ZIKV localization in the placenta to define
whether transmission occurred by a trans-placental route. The
mouse placenta is comprised of the maternal decidua and the
fetal embryo-derived compartments, including the junctional
and labyrinth zones (Figure 2A). Different types of trophoblasts
with distinct functions reside within all three layers, including
trophoblast giant cells, glycogen trophoblasts, and spongiotro-
phoblasts. Within the labyrinth zone, fetal capillaries are lined
by fetal blood vessel endothelium, which are separated from
maternal sinusoids by a layer of mononuclear trophoblasts
and a syncytiotrophoblast bilayer (Figure 2A) (Simmons and
Cross, 2005; Watson and Cross, 2005). We performed RNA
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) coupled with histopath-
ological analysis in ZIKV-infected Ifnar1+/� placentas and
confirmed the presence of ZIKV RNA in different trophoblast
cells, including glycogen trophoblasts and spongiotrophoblasts
(Figure 2B) and to a lesser extent in mononuclear trophoblasts
and syncytiotrophoblasts (data not shown). These findings are
consistent with cell culture studies demonstrating ZIKV infection
of human trophoblast cell lines (Bayer et al., 2016) and suggest
that the mouse model of infection during pregnancy recapitu-
lates features of human disease including placental tropism of
ZIKV. We independently confirmed ZIKV infection and replica-
tion in two of three human trophoblast cell lines (Figure S2).
Transmission electron microscopy of placentas revealed multi-
ple 50 nm dense bodies within the endoplasmic reticulum of the
mononuclear trophoblasts (Figure 2C, left), consistent with ZIKV
infection of the maternal placenta. As these bodies resemble
flavivirus virions (Allison et al., 2003) and were not present in
uninfected animals, they are suggestive for the presence of
virus. Proximity to non-nucleated maternal erythrocytes (Fig-
ure 2C, left) confirmed the location as within the maternal face
of the placenta. Consistent with a trans-placental route of infec-
tion, we also observed bodies resembling virions within the
endoplasmic reticulum of fetal endothelial cells that lined
damaged fetal capillaries (Figure 2C, right). The cellular and ul-
trastructural evidence of ZIKV infection in trophoblasts and fetal
endothelium suggests that maternal viremia leads to compro-
mise of the placental barrier by infecting fetal trophoblasts
and entering the fetal circulation.
Pathological analysis of ZIKV-infected Ifnar1�/� (maternal) and
Ifnar1+/� (fetal) placentas showed severe vascular injury charac-
terized by irregularly shaped, reduced fetal capillaries and
destruction of the placental microvasculature (Figures 3A and
3B, Ifnar het severe). Infected Ifnar1�/� placentas were smaller,
mostly because the labyrinth zone was markedly thinned. In
addition, apoptotic trophoblasts were evident in ZIKV-infected
placentas (Figure 3A, black arrows). Immunofluorescence stain-
ing of pan-cytokeratin, a pan-trophoblast marker, was dimin-
ished in infected Ifnar1�/� placentas, consistent with evidence
of apoptotic trophoblasts (Figure 3B). Apoptosis in trophoblasts
can cause disruption of the placental barrier, which compro-
mises protection against pathogens (Robbins and Bakardjiev,
2012). Indeed, ZIKV-infected Ifnar1+/� placentas contained large
numbers of nucleated fetal erythrocytes (Figure 3A, blue arrows),
key indicators of fetal stress. Evidence of vascular damage and
fewer blood vessels also was reflected by diminished staining of
vimentin, a marker of fetal blood vessels in mouse placentas
(Figure 3B).
Histopathological assessment of ZIKV-infected Ifnar1+/� fetal
brains demonstrated abundant apoptotic cells within multiple re-
gions at E13.5 (Figures 4A–4D). Activated caspase-3 staining
showed low levels of physiological apoptosis in uninfected fe-
tuses (Figures 4E–4H), whereas infected animals had apoptotic
cells throughout the midbrain and hindbrain (Figures 4B–4D
and 4I). Although we could localize viral RNA in infected pla-
centas, multiple attempts at RNA FISH staining of ZIKV-infected
fetal brains did not yield a clear pattern of viral RNA expression
(data not shown), despite the recovery of infectious virus (Figures
S1A and S1B). Accordingly, we cannot state with certainty
whether the enhanced apoptosis within ZIKV-infected fetuses
results from infection-induced apoptosis or another process,
including ischemia due to placental insufficiency. The presence
of numerous apoptotic cells within the developing central ner-
vous system (CNS) coupled with the established neurotropism
of ZIKV (Lazear et al., 2016), however, suggests direct infection
may contribute.
DISCUSSION
Epidemiological studies have found that ZIKV infection during
pregnancy causes catastrophic neurodevelopmental outcomes
in human fetuses, but there currently is no effective treatment
or prevention of ZIKV infection other than avoidance of its
mosquito vectors. Given the devastating effects of this rapidly
emerging infectious disease, small animal models of ZIKV
infection during pregnancy are urgently needed to test candi-
date therapeutics and vaccines that could prevent or mitigate
intrauterine infection with ZIKV. We developed two mouse
models that support ZIKV replication and trans-placental trans-
mission in pregnant dams: (1) a model of severe disease in
pregnant Ifnar1�/� dams that resulted in fetal demise; and (2)
a less severe model of ZIKV pathogenesis in utero using
pregnant WT dams that were given anti-ifnar antibody prior
to and during infection, which resulted in mild IUGR and
viral infection within the fetal head during a key period in
neurodevelopment.
The placenta acts as a barrier against infections, due to multi-
ple unique structural, cellular, and immune properties. The detri-
mental effects of congenital viruses on pregnancy and fetal out-
comes occur in part because of impaired trophoblast function
(Arechavaleta-Velasco et al., 2002). Defective placentas can
lead to severe maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality during
pregnancy, including spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm
birth, IUGR, and other complications. We observed profound
pathological changes in ZIKV-infected placentas, including
1084
Cell 165, 1081–1091, May 19, 2016
 trophoblast apoptosis, abnormal fetal capillary features, and
increased fetal nucleated erythrocytes, indicating malfunction
of mouse placentas caused by ZIKV infection.
We observed variability in susceptibility to ZIKV infection of
different human trophoblast cell lines. Trophoblast cell lines

 explants and first trimester human villous explants, respec-
tively, which exhibit features of extravillous trophoblasts
(EVTs) including high invasive capacity and expression of
HLA-G, a MHC class II molecule, were susceptible to ZIKV
infection. In contrast, a relatively undifferentiated cytotropho-
blast cell line (BeWo) was not. Previous studies have shown
that EVTs are most susceptible to bacterial infections, partic-
ularly during the first and second trimesters (Cao and Mysor-
ekar, 2014; Robbins and Bakardjiev, 2012; Zeldovich and Ba-
kardjiev, 2012). Thus, it is possible that in early pregnancy,
ZIKV infects EVTs and enters the fetal circulation. Placentas
nearer to term, which have reduced EVTs on the tips of
anchoring villi and a more fully developed placental barrier,
in general exhibit greater resistance to infection. Indeed, hu-
man primary trophoblasts of the villous syncytiotrophoblast

 infection due to the production of IFN-l in paracrine manner
(Bayer et al., 2016).
Several aspects of our models of ZIKV infection during preg-
nancy resemble intrauterine infection by ZIKV in humans. Com-
mon features included tropism of ZIKV for the placenta, evidence
of intrauterine infection, and fetal demise. However, infection
during pregnancy in mice did not recapitulate all aspects of hu-
man disease, as we did not detect microcephaly, brain calcifica-
tions, or absence of individual brain structures, such as the
corpus callosum. There are several reasons why ZIKV may not
have induced these pathological manifestations in our models.
In mice, brain neurogenesis begins around E10 (Finlay and Dar-
lington, 1995), and the brain of a newborn pup is relatively imma-
ture at postnatal day 1, akin to the developmental stage of the
human brain at mid-gestation (Semple et al., 2013). As the devel-
opment of the mouse brain includes a major postnatal compo-
nent, examination of the neurodevelopmental effects of ZIKV

infection in mice may require infection
later during pregnancy. Since ZIKV infects
mature neurons as well as neural cell pro-
genitors and limits their growth (Tang
et al., 2016), the morphological effects of
ZIKV infection on brain development
may be more apparent in species with
larger cerebral cortices.
Although
ZIKV-associated
micro-
cephaly has drawn major public health
and media attention, ZIKV infection of hu-
man fetuses does not always cause this
manifestation, and the sequelae of intra-
uterine infection in the absence of gross
morphological abnormalities remain to
be defined. In pregnant WT dams that
were treated with an anti-ifnar antibody, we observed only mild
growth restriction in the developing fetus although ZIKV RNA
was detectable in the fetal head at both E13.5 and E16.5 after
infection. Future behavioral studies may define whether intra-
uterine infection by ZIKV has long-term neurological effects in
mice and serves as a model for evaluation of disease in humans
(Staples et al., 2016).
We found that the murine placentas can be infected by ZIKV.
Infection of Ifnar1�/� dams led to severe placental damage
and destruction of the microvasculature, which most likely
limited blood flow to the developing fetus and caused severe
IUGR, ischemia, and fetal demise. In vivo infection of the
mouse placenta with ZIKV may provide a model for defining
host factors required for or that restrict infection, which could
suggest a path for developing therapies to limit placental and
intrauterine infection. For example, since IFN-l restricts ZIKV
replication within human trophoblasts from term placentas
Cell 165, 1081–1091, May 19, 2016

 (Bayer et al., 2016), studies are planned to test the effects of
exogenously administered IFN-l on in utero transmission in
mice.
Maternal-fetal transmission of pathogens can be mediated
by diverse pathways, with the most common being via an
ascending route and hemochorial transmission. Viruses from
the urogenital tract can disseminate into intrauterine space and
colonize the fetal membrane or the placenta in an ascending
manner (Edwards et al., 2015). In contrast, viruses from the
maternal blood circulation can be transported to the feto-
maternal space and infect trophoblasts lining the maternal-fetal
interface. These trophoblasts include the EVTs, which embed in
maternal decidua, endovascular extravillous cytotrophoblasts,
and villous trophoblasts, which are bathed in maternal blood
(Delorme-Axford et al., 2014). Our studies suggest that ZIKV
can infect the placenta through blood-placental transmission
and bypass the placental barrier to infect the fetus. Nonetheless,
ascending infection routes might be important in sexual trans-
mission during pregnancy. ZIKV has been found in human semen
(Musso et al., 2015) and mouse testes (Lazear et al., 2016; Rossi
et al., 2016) and can be transmitted sexually from male to female
in humans (Musso et al., 2015).
Intrauterine infection with flaviviruses may be an underappre-
ciated phenomenon. Prior to the ZIKV epidemic, there were
isolated descriptions of trans-placental infection in humans
with other flaviviruses including WNV and JEV (Chaturvedi
et al., 1980; Nguyen et al., 2002). These reports suggest that
sporadic cases of flavivirus-induced miscarriage or fetal demise
might have been unrecognized, although this remains specula-
tive. We are currently testing whether additional variations in
ZIKV infection (e.g., dose, route of administration, virus strain,
time of infection during pregnancy, and time of analysis) in our
mouse model of in utero transmission can recapitulate other
morphological abnormalities in the CNS that are described in
human disease. Of note, intrauterine infection with Saint
Louis encephalitis virus, a less well studied flavivirus, caused
severe neurological outcomes in mice. In that model, disease
depended on the gestational date of infection (Andersen and
Hanson, 1970); mice infected early in gestation survived,
whereas those inoculated later developed neurological malfor-
mations and died as neonates (Andersen and Hanson, 1970;
Andersen and Hanson, 1975). In our studies with DENV and an
anti-ifnar-blocking antibody, inoculation of mice did not result
in placental infection, although it is possible that this was due
to a diminished ability of DENV to replicate in mice compared
to ZIKV. Experiments that test infection of pregnant animals
with additional related viruses may clarify whether placental
infection is an underappreciated clinical manifestation of flavivi-
rus pathogenesis.
Treatment and prevention of ZIKV infection will likely require
small animal models for testing of vaccines and potential thera-
pies. The mouse models described in our study may be relevant
to studying mechanisms of pathogenesis and determining
whether vaccines given prior to pregnancy can prevent infection
in the developing fetus. Mouse models of ZIKV infection during
pregnancy also may provide fundamental insights into how the
placental barrier prevents viral infection from the developing
fetus, and why this process fails in the context of specific path-
ogens. Finally, our animal model of in utero transmission estab-
lishes causality of a fetal syndrome associated with ZIKV infec-
tion in mice.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics Statement
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes
of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (Assurance
number A3381-01). Inoculations were performed under anesthesia induced
and maintained with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts
were made to minimize animal suffering.
Viruses and Titration
Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Omega) and L-glutamine
at 37�C with 5% CO2. ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (French Polynesia, 2013) was pro-
vided by the Arbovirus Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion with permission (X. de Lamballerie, Aix Marseille Universite
´ ) (Baronti et al.,
2014). ZIKV stocks were propagated in Vero cells and titrated by focus-forming
assay (FFA). Infected cell foci were detected at 48 hr after infection, following
fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde and incubation with 500 ng/mL of flavivirus
cross-reactive mouse monoclonal antibody E60 (Oliphant et al., 2006) for 2 hr
at room temperature. After incubation for 1 hr with a 1:5,000 dilution of horse-
radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), foci were
detected by addition of TrueBlue substrate (KPL). Foci were analyzed with a
CTL Immunospot instrument. Studies with ZIKV were conducted under
biosafety level 2 (BSL2) and animal BSL3 (A-BSL3) containment.
Mouse Experiments
Ifnar1�/� mice (Hwang et al., 1995) were backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 back-
ground. Mice were bred in a specific-pathogen-free facility at Washington Uni-
versity, or purchased (WT animals) from Jackson Laboratories. Mice were set
up for timed-matings and at embryonic days E6.5 or E7.5 were inoculated with
ZIKV by subcutaneous (footpad) route with 103 FFU of ZIKV in 50 mL of PBS.
Mice were sacrificed at E13.5, E15.5, or E16.5 depending on the experimental
design. Placentas and fetuses were harvested from the infected mice. Fetus
size was measured as the crown-rump length 3 occipito-frontal diameter of
the head. In some experiments, WT mice were treated with indicated doses
of an Ifnar-blocking mouse mAb (MAR1-5A3) or isotype control mouse mAb
(GIR-208) (produced by Leinco Technologies) (Sheehan et al., 2006; Sheehan
et al., 2015) by intraperitoneal injection prior to and after ZIKV or DENV-3
infection.
Measurement of Viral Burden
ZIKV-infected pregnant mice were euthanized on E13.5, E15.5, or E16.5. Pla-
centas and fetal heads were weighed and homogenized with zirconia beads in
a MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche Life Science) in 250 or 500 mL of PBS. All
homogenized tissues from infected animals were stored at �80�C until virus
titration. With some samples, viral burden was determined by plaque assay
on Vero cells. Samples were thawed, clarified by centrifugation (2,000 3 g at
4�C for 10 min), and then diluted serially prior to infection of Vero cells. Plaque
assays were overlaid with low-melt agarose, and 4 days later were fixed with
10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet (Brien et al., 2013). Tissue
samples and serum from ZIKV-infected mice were extracted with the RNeasy
Mini Kit (tissues) or Viral RNA Mini Kit (serum) (QIAGEN). ZIKV RNA levels were
determined by one-step quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) on
an ABI 7500 Fast Instrument using standard cycling conditions. Viral burden
was expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA equivalents per g or per mL after
comparison with a standard curve produced using serial 10-fold dilutions of
ZIKV RNA. A published primer set was used to detect ZIKV RNA (Lanciotti
et al., 2008): Fwd, 50-CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG-30; Rev, 50-CCACTAACGTTC
TTTTGCAGACAT-30; Probe, 50-/56-FAM/AGCCTACCT/ZEN/TGACAAGCAAT
CAGACACTCAA/3IABkFQ/-30, (Integrated DNA Technologies).

 RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
RNA FISH was performed using ViewRNA ISH Tissue 2-Plex Assay kit (Affyme-
trix) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded tissue sections were hydrated, heat-treated for 10 min at 90�C,
and digested with protease for 20 min. Endogenous alkaline phosphatase
was inactivated with 0.2 M HCl and 300 mM NaCl at room temperature for
15 min before the probe hybridization. The probe targeting ZIKV RNA was de-
signed and synthesized by Affymetrix and was based on the ZIKV French Poly-
nesian 2013 genomic RNA sequence (accession number SAMN04592777).
Positive controls (probe-targeting housekeeping genes) and no-probe nega-
tive controls were included in all samples. Tissues were counterstained with
DAPI and Gill’s hematoxylin and visualized using standard bright-field and
confocal microscopes.
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence Imaging
Fetuses were removed by Caesarian-section on E13.5, post-fixed in 4% para-
formaldehyde, and sectioned at 70 mM with a vibratome. Immunohistochem-
istry was performed by immersing sections in blocking solution and incubating
overnight in primary antibodies raised against activated caspase-3 (AC3; Cell
Signaling) and Ki-67 (BD-Biosciences). Subsequently, sections were rinsed
and reacted with fluorescent secondary antibodies.
Harvested placentas were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher) at
room temperature and embedded in paraffin. At least three placentas from
different litters with the indicated treatments were sectioned and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin to assess morphology. For immunofluorescence
staining of mouse placentas, deparaffinized tissues were blocked in buffer
(1% BSA, 0.3% Triton, 1 3 PBS) for 2 hr and incubated with primary antibodies
overnight. The following primary antibodies were used: cytokeratin (1:500, rab-
bit, DAKO Z0622) and vimentin (1:500, rabbit, Abcam ab92547). After rinsing
with PBS, secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (1:500 in PBS)
was applied for 1 hr at room temperature. Samples were counterstained
with DAPI (4’6’-diamidino-2-phenilindole, 1:1,000 dilution) for 10 min and
mounted in Prolong Gold (Life Technologies). RNA FISH imaging of mouse pla-
centas was acquired using a TSC SPE inverted confocal microscope (Leica)
using a 633 objective. Histology images were captured by use of a Nikon
Eclipse microscope equipped with an Olympus DP71 color camera under
203 and 403 objectives.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Mouse placental samples were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5%
glutaraldehyde (Polysciences) in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 hr
at room temperature and overnight at 4�C, washed in cacodylate buffer,
post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Polysciences) for 1 hr, then rinsed with
distilled H2O before en bloc staining with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (Ted
Pella) for 1 hr. Samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and
embedded in Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella). Sections (90 nm thick) were cut
with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate, and imaged on a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope
(JEOL USA).
mAb Generation
A more complete description of the anti-ZIKV mAbs will be provided in a forth-
coming manuscript (E. Fernandez, D. Platt, and M. Diamond, unpublished data).
Briefly, to create ZV-2, Irf3�/� mice were infected and boosted with 103 FFU of
ZIKV (MR-766 and H/PF/2013, respectively) and given a final intravenous boost
with live 106 FFU of ZIKV (H/F/2013) 3 days prior to fusion with P3X63 myeloma
cells. Hybridomas secreting antibodies that reacted with ZIKV-infected Vero
cells were identified by flow cytometry and cloned by limiting dilution. ZV-2
was purified by protein A affinity chromatography.
Cell Culture and Infection
JEG-3 and BeWo cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in F12/DMEM
media supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies) at 37�C with 5% CO2.
HTR-8/SVneo cells were provided by C. H. Graham (Queen’s University) and
maintained in RPMI 1640 media with 5% FBS. For flow cytometry and viral
yield assays, trophoblast cell lines were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 3 105
cells per well. For immunofluorescence staining, trophoblast cell lines were
cultured in 4-well chamber slides (Millipore). Cells were counted and infected
with ZIKV at a MOI 0.1 for 2 hr, washed twice with warm PBS and cultured with
fresh medium. At indicated time points after infection, supernatants were har-
vested for virus titration, and cells were trypsinized for flow cytometry or fixed
for immunofluorescence staining using ZV-2, a ZIKV-specific mAb.
Data Analysis
All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. For viral burden anal-
ysis, the log titers and levels of viral RNA were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney
test or ANOVA. A p value of < 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences.
Significance of the survival rates were assessed by Chi-square test. The
morphological measurements were assessed by a Mann-Whitney test or by
a 2-way ANOVA.
