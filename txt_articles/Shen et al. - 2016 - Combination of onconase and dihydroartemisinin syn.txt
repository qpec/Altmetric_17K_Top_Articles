Abstract
Onconase (Onc) is a cytotoxic ribonuclease derived from leopard frog oocytes or early embryos,
and has been applied to the treatment of malignant mesothelioma in clinics. Onc also exhibits
effective growth suppression of human non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Artemisinin (Art) and
its derivatives are novel antimalarial drugs that exhibit antitumor and antivirus activities. In this
study, we investigated the antitumor effects of combinations of Onc and an Art derivative, dihy-
droartemisinin (DHA), both in vitro and in vivo. Isobologram analyses showed synergistic effects
on the proliferation of NSCLC cells under the treatment with Onc and DHA. In vivo experiments
also showed that the antitumor effect of Onc was markedly enhanced by DHA in mouse xenograft
models. No obvious adverse effect was observed after the treatment. The density of microvascula-
ture in the tumor tissues treated with Onc/DHA combination was lower than those treated with
Onc or DHA alone. The above results are consistent with the results of the matrigel plug test for
angiogenesis suppression using the Onc/DHA combination. These results imply that the anti-
angiogenesis effects may make important contributions to the in vivo antitumor effects of the
Onc/DHA combination treatment. The Onc/DHA combination therapy may have the potential to
become a novel regimen for NSCLC and mesothelioma.
Key words: onconase, dihydroartemisinin, non–small-cell lung cancer, mesothelioma, synergistic effect, anti-angiogenesis effect
Introduction
Onconase (Onc) is a ribonuclease (RNase) derived from oocytes or
early embryos of the Northern Leopard frog (Rana pipiens) [1]. Onc
exhibits potent cytotoxicity in a number of tumors, but lower cytotox-
icity in most normal cells [2]. Onc is the smallest member of the
RNase A superfamily and is composed of 104 amino acid residues
with 4 disulfide bonds. Its primary sequence shares 30% homology
with that of RNase A, and their 3D structures are relatively similar.
Onc is very stable [3] and resistant to proteolysis, with a Tm (midpoint
of thermal transition curve) of ~90°C [4]. This feature may contribute
to its potent cytotoxicity. RNase A and other members of the super-
family have much higher RNA-degrading activity than Onc, but much
lower cytotoxicity than Onc. RNase A and other family members can
be inactivated by RNase inhibitor (RIs) proteins which are inherently
present in mammalian cells, whereas Onc is resistant to the inhibition
by RIs [5]. This may explain the increased cytotoxicity of Onc.

 Onc can also arrest tumor cells in the G1 phase, thereby suppres-
sing their proliferation [6]. The mechanism of its cytotoxicity has
not been clearly elucidated, but is presumably based on its RNase
activity [7]. Onc prefers to degrade tRNAs. In addition to suppres-
sing protein synthesis, tRNA degradation can also trigger apoptosis
in tumor cells [8]. Gene array analysis showed that Onc treatment
also resulted in down-regulation of tumor-associated microRNAs
(miRNAs) [9]. Subsequent studies clarified that Onc preferentially
degrades precursors of miRNAs, but not miRNAs [10]. Down-
regulation of miRNAs may play an important role in Onc
cytotoxicity.
Onc is the first RNase that has been clinically applied in can-
cer therapy. Onc has been approved for clinical use as an orphan
drug for unresectable malignant mesothelioma in the USA,
Europe, and Australia [11,12]. Clinical trials showed that Onc
was well tolerated and could be repeatedly administered with
low immunogenicity. Its dose-limiting toxicity was temporary
nephritic toxicity, but this could be reversed after the treatment
was finished [12].
Artemisinin (Art) was discovered by Chinese scientists in the
1970s and is extracted from a Chinese traditional herb, Sweet
wormwood or Qinghao (Artemisia annua L.). Art and its derivatives
such as dihydroartemisinin (DHA), artesunate, arteether, and arte-
mether are sesquiterpene lactones. Art and its derivatives are widely
used as antimalarial drugs, and also have selective antitumor effects
[13,14]. However, the mechanisms have not been clearly revealed.
Art and its derivatives exhibit growth suppression in a number of
tumors and tumor cells in vitro or in vivo, including hepatoma, pan-
creatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and Kaposi
sarcoma [15–17]. They can also inhibit tumor angiogenesis [18–20]
and tumor metastasis [21].
Berger et al. [22] used artesunate to treat two late-stage uveal
melanoma patients on a compassionate-use basis, who typically
have a medium survival time of 2–5 months. After treatment with
artesunate
together
with
other chemotherapeutic drugs,
one
patient survived for 24 months and the second was still alive 47
months after first diagnosis. Singh et al. [23] reported another suc-
cessful case of a pituitary macroadenoma treated with artemether.
However, few formal clinical trials using Art or its derivatives in
cancer have been conducted. Very recently, Dafra Pharma Ltd
conducted a clinical trial in advanced cervical cancer using
Artenimol-R [24]. The symptoms in all patients disappeared after
a 3-week treatment. Six of the 10 late-stage patients survived after
2 years.
Both Onc and Art have exhibited their potential in cancer ther-
apy. In this study, we presented a novel regimen of cancer therapy
using the combination of Onc and DHA, and showed enhanced
antitumor effects and low toxicity of this combination treatment.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
All animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment.
Animal handling was performed in accordance with institutional
guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee in Shanghai Research Center for Model Organisms
(Shanghai, China). When the experiments were finished, the mice
were euthanized with CO2. All surgery was performed under
sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to min-
imize suffering.
Reagents
Recombinant Onc was prepared as previously described [25]. DHA
was obtained from RongWo Pharmaceutical Technology Development
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Cell culture
The MSTO-211H human mesothelioma cell line was obtained from
ATCC
(Manassas,
USA).
Human
non–small-cell
lung
cancer
(NSCLC) cell lines NCI-H661, SK-MES-1, SPC-A-1, and A549 were
obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank, Chinese Academy of
Sciences (Shanghai, China). Human umbilical vascular endothelium
cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Shanghai Bogoo Biological
Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Cells were grown in Ham’s
F12K (A549 cells), RPMI1640 (MSTO-211H, NCI-H661, SPC-A-1,
and HUVE cells), or DMEM/High (SK-MES-1) medium supplemen-
ted with 10% fetal serum and 100 µg/ml penicillin (Sigma, St Louis,
USA) and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) at 37°C under 5% CO2.
All the medium were from Gibco (Grand Island, USA)
Cytotoxicity assay
Each well of 96-well plates was seeded with 90 µl of cell suspension
containing 5000 cells, leaving 10 µl for testing drugs. For the com-
bination treatment, Onc was added on the day after seeding, and
DHA was added on the next day. The cells were cultured for an
additional 48 h and (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-
zolium bromide) tetrazolium reduction assays (MTT assays) were
performed as previously described [26].
Isobologram
The antitumor effects of Onc/DHA combination were analyzed by
isobolograms [27,28]. The specific highest concentrations of Onc
[A] and DHA [B] were set for each cell line. Onc/DHA mixtures
with A/B = 5/0, 4/1, 3/2, 1/4, and 0/5 were serially diluted and
added into wells. The cytotoxicities of the treatments and controls
were assayed by MTT methods. The isobolograms were established
based on the IC50 data. The X-axis shows the concentration of Onc,
the Y-axis shows the concentration of DHA. The concentration
range is set based on the IC50 value of the corresponding single
drug, which varied among the individual cell lines because they dis-
tinctively vary in sensitivities to the tested drugs. The antitumor
effect of a combination was considered additive when dots were
located around the line between 0/5 and 5/0. It was considered syn-
ergistic when dots were located at the left side of the line, but antag-
onistic when dots were located at the right side.
In vivo antitumor activity
A549 cell suspension was mixed with an equal volume of 100%
Matrigel (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, USA) on ice. Cells (2 ×
106) were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) into the right flank of
each BALB/c nude mouse (male, 8 weeks old). The mice were ran-
domly divided into four groups (five mice each) and injected with
saline, Onc alone (3 mg/kg), DHA alone (10 mg/kg), or the combin-
ation (Onc 3 mg/kg followed by DHA 10 mg/ml next day) from Day
8 after tumor inoculation (this day was designated as Day 0). Onc
was injected intravenously (i.v.), whereas DHA was injected intra-
peritoneal (i.p.). The drugs were given twice a week for 3 weeks.
Tumor dimensions were measured using calipers and the tumor
volume was calculated by the formula: V (mm3) = D (mm) ×
d2 (mm2) × 0.4, where D and d are the smallest and largest tumor

 diameters, respectively. Body weights of the treated mice were
recorded. A similar in vivo experiment was performed using the
MSTO-211H cell line with a dose modification in which injection of
Onc was 1.5 mg/kg per mouse and each injection of DHA was
20 mg/kg per mouse.
Immunohistological staining of the tumor vasculature
Sections (6–8 µm)
prepared from formalin-fixed
and paraffin-
embedded tumor tissues taken from the treated mice on Day 36
were used for studying tumor angiogenesis. The sections were incu-
bated with rabbit anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
antibody (BIOS, Beijing, China) at 1:200 dilution and followed by
incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
IgG (Vector Lab, Burlingame, USA) at 1:1 dilution. Color was devel-
oped with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine.
Matrigel plug assay
Matrigel plug assay was carried out as described previously [29] with
slight modifications. Briefly, 20 male nude mice (BALB/c, nu/nu),
6–8 weeks old, were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1
(saline, i.v.); Group 2 (Onc, 3 mg/kg, i.v.); Group 3 (DHA, 10 mg/kg,
i.p.); and Group 4 (Onc, 3 mg/kg, i.v., followed by DHA, 10 mg/kg,
i.p. on the next day). Each injection volume was 100 µl. Drugs
were given twice a week. After the first-week treatment, each mouse
was s.c. inoculated with 0.5 ml of Matrigel (BD Pharmingen) contain-
ing 150 ng/ml VEGF and 200 ng/ml bFGF (R&D, Minneapolis, USA)
to form Matrigel plugs. The mice underwent another week of treat-
ment as before (twice a week). The Matrigel plugs were taken out 1
day after the treatment was ended, fixed with 10% formalin and
embedded in paraffin [30]. The sections were stained using the Masson
Trichrome staining kit (Shanghai Yuanye Biotech, Shanghai, China).
Endothelial cell tube formation assay
In vitro angiogenesis was assessed using the tube formation assay
[28]. Briefly, a 15-well µ-Slide plate (ibidi GmbH, Martinsried,
Germany)
was
coated
with
10 µl
ice-chilled
Matrigel
(BD
Biosciences) solution by incubating at 37°C for 1 h. HUVECs were
then seeded into the Matrigel-coated wells (2 × 104 cells per well).
Cells were treated with Onc (5 µM), DHA (2.5 µM), or the combin-
ation of Onc (5 µM) and DHA (2.5 µM) and then incubated at 37°C
for 6 h. The tubes were stained with Calcein-AM (final concentra-
tion 10 µM, Sigma). Images were observed under the Nikon Eclipse
TS100 fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and ana-
lyzed using Image-Pro Plus. The experiments were performed three
independent times.
TUNEL assay
TUNEL assay was guided by the directions of an apoptotic cell
detection kit (Promega, Madison, USA) as per manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, the TUNEL assay was carried by incubating the
fixed sections (6–8 µm) with the TUNEL reagent containing label
DNA strand breaks with fluorescein-12-dUTP at 37°C for 1 h. The
samples were washed in 1 × PBS. Fluorescent images were captured
using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at ×100
magnification. The total number of TUNEL positive cells was
counted from at least five images from each sample. Each experi-
ment was repeated three times.
Statistical analysis
Data are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
Differences between groups were estimated using one-way analysis of
variance followed by the Bonferroni post-test analysis. Significant dif-
ferences were considered when P-values <0.05. The statistical analysis
was calculated and plotted using GraphPad Prism version 5.0.
Results
Onc combined with DHA exhibited significant
synergistic antitumor effects in vitro
The in vitro antitumor effects of the combination of Onc and DHA
on human NSCLC and malignant mesothelioma cells were analyzed
by isobolograms. The cytotoxicity of the Onc/DHA combination in
different ratios was measured by MTT assay and the data are shown
in Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2. For each tested cell line, the iso-
bolograms derived from the IC50 values of Onc/DHA combinations
showed that all data between 0/5 and 5/0 (except 0/5 and 5/0) were
located at the left side of the line (Fig. 1A,B). These results revealed
significant synergistic antitumor effects of the Onc/DHA combin-
ation in all tested human NSCLC cell lines and a human malignant
mesothelioma cell line. In particular, in the human lung squamous
cell carcinoma SK-MES-1 cells, IC50 values for both drugs dropped
from 1200 to 10 µM. The confidence interval (CI) value was as low
as 0.019. In human lung adenocarcinoma Spc-A-1 cells, the syner-
gistic antitumor effect was also notable with the lowest CI value of
0.285 (Fig. 1C). The IC50 values of each treatment are shown in
Table 1.
DHA enhanced in vivo antitumor effects of Onc
We then examined the effects of the drugs, single or in combination,
in nude mice inoculated with cancer cells. The drug administration
was initiated from Day 8 after the tumor inoculation. This day was
designated as Day 0 in Figs. 2A and 3A. The drugs were given twice
a week for 3 weeks, and drug administration ended on Day 17.
Figures 2A and 3A showed that while either Onc or DHA alone
showed moderate antitumor effects, the Onc/DHA combination
group exhibited more effective suppression of tumor growth. The
Onc/DHA combination in mice injected with A549 cells showed
that DHA could significantly increase the antitumor effect compared
with Onc alone (Fig. 2A). The antitumor effects of Onc/DHA com-
bination in mice injected with MSTO-211H cells showed that DHA
could also significantly increase the antitumor effect compared with
Onc alone (Fig. 3A). These results show that similar to the in vitro
antitumor effects of Onc/DHA combination, the in vivo antitumor
effects of the Onc/DHA combination in tumors derived from A549
cells and MSTO-211H cells were also increased.
DHA did not enhance the in vivo toxicity effects of Onc
The mean body weight of all drug-treated groups only slightly chan-
ged in comparison with the control group (Figs. 2B and 3B). No
obvious adverse effect to the mice was observed in Onc/DHA com-
bination in vivo. Biochemical analyses of blood samples did not
reveal significant differences between the treated groups and the
control group (data not shown) either. These results indicate that
Onc/DHA combination treatment is a safe therapeutic regimen.

 DHA enhanced in vivo suppression of tumor
angiogenesis of Onc
The immunohistological staining of VEGF expression in MSTO
xenograft tumors showed that Onc alone and DHA alone did not
exhibit a significant influence on VEGF expression compared with
controls (Fig. 3C). Notably, a significant reduction of VEGF
expression was observed in tumors from Onc/DHA-treated mice
compared with mice treated with either drug alone or control mice,
which indicated enhanced suppression to tumor angiogenesis
(Fig. 3C).
To further verify the anti-angiogenesis effects of the Onc/DHA
combination, the Matrigel plug test was performed. The microvessel
densities of the Onc-alone and the DHA-alone groups did not have
significant differences compared with saline controls (P > 0.05), while
the microvessel density of the Onc/DHA combination group was
markedly lower than that of the saline group (P = 0.018) (Fig. 4A,B).

 Suppression of endothelial cell tube formation was
enhanced by Onc/DHA combination treatment
Analysis of HUVEC tube formation on Matrigel (Fig. 5A) and statis-
tical analysis (Fig. 5B) showed that while no significant differences
were observed among the groups treated with saline, 5 µM Onc, and
2.5 µM DHA, the combination of 5 µM Onc and 2.5 µM DHA sig-
nificantly suppressed tube formation.
Onc/DHA combination blocked tumor growth distinct
from apoptosis
To explore the antitumor mechanism of the Onc/DHA combination,
TUNEL assay was performed to analyze the apoptosis in tumors.
Compared with Onc or DHA alone, no significant increase of apop-
tosis signal was observed in the Onc/DHA combination group
(Supplementary Fig. S3). We also performed in vitro apoptosis assay
by the Annexin V/FITC binding methods. Consistent with the
in vivo apoptosis data, no significant increase of apoptosis signal
was observed in the Onc/DHA combination group compared with
single treatments (data not shown). These data suggest that there are
other mechanisms inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells and the
growth of tumors.
Discussion
Considering that in the presence of heme and ferrous ions DHA can
release reactive oxygen species and free radicals that may inactivate
Onc [31], we optimized the drug administration schedules. It was
found that the interaction of Onc and DHA was antagonistic when
DHA was added 1 day before the addition of Onc. It was additive
as both drugs were added at the same time. Only when DHA was
added 1 day later, it was synergistic. In this study, the schedule that
DHA was added 1 day later than Onc was applied in our in vitro
and in vivo experiments, and also in our angiogenesis studies. The
underlying mechanism for this phenomenon may be complicated
and need further study.
In our study, complete suppression of tumor growth was
observed in the Onc/DHA combination treatment group while the
Onc- and DHA-alone groups only showed moderate suppression in
comparison with the control group. No significant body weight
change or obvious adverse effect was found among all groups. We
carried out a similar in vivo experiment for the combination of Onc
and epirubicin, an adriamycin analog, in nude mice bearing A549
cells. The Onc/epirubicin combination achieved similar tumor sup-
pression to Onc/DHA. However, the mean body weight in Onc/epir-
ubicin
and
epirubicin-alone
groups
significantly
decreased
in
comparison with the control group (data not shown). In addition to
body weight loss, other adverse effects, such as asthenia, exuvia-
tions, temperature drop, hypokinesia, and diarrhea were observed in
mice treated with epirubicin or the Onc/epirubicin combination. The
combination of adriamycin and Onc has been applied in unresect-
able malignant mesothelioma treatment in the USA. These findings
suggest that the Onc/DHA combination may have the potential to
be a novel efficacious tumor therapeutic regimen with much less tox-
icity and fewer side effects.
In a previous study, Lee et al. [32] found that Onc did not
change the number of CCL-209 endothelial cells in the plateau-
growth phase; however, it effectively suppressed the proliferation of
exponentially
growing
CCL-209
cells.
However,
the
anti-
angiogenesis activity of Art and its derivatives have been confirmed
in several labs [15,18–20,30]. It is noteworthy that DHA down-
regulates VEGF expression in K562 cells and reduces the secretion
of VEGF from the cells [20]. Whether can the anti-angiogenesis
activity of Onc be enhanced by DHA? Our results provide a positive
conclusion.

 First, reduced VEGF expression could be found in sections of
tumor tissue taken from the mice treated with the Onc/DHA com-
bination in comparison with other groups, indicating that the com-
bination of Onc and DHA not only exhibits enhanced cytotoxicity
against tumor cells, but also exhibits enhanced anti-angiogenesis
effects in tumors. Our results demonstrated significantly decreased
mean microvessel density and reduced endothelial cell tube number
in the Onc/DHA combination group compared with other groups
The enhanced anti-angiogenesis activity may play an important role
in the process of tumor suppression in the mice treated with the
Onc/DHA combination.
Several previous studies demonstrated that DHA can inhibit
angiogenesis by decreasing the expressions of HIFα, VEGF, and
VEGF receptor [33–36], while Onc treatment was demonstrated to

 down-regulate NF-κB expression in cells via regulation of specific
mRNAs [10,29]. NF-κB is a direct modulator of HIF expression
[37,38], and HIF and NF-κB can activate VEGF expression
[39,40]. Whether Onc and DHA can synergistically down-regulate
NF-κB to suppress the HIF-VEGF pathway and lead to inhibit
angiogenesis is still unknown. The underlying mechanism of the
synergistic antitumor activity of Onc and DHA needs further
exploration.
Onc is a well-tolerated anti-cancer drug in clinical trials.
However, Onc also exhibits dose-dependent renal toxicity, which
limits its use in high doses. DHA or other Art derivatives are safe
in malarial treatments, while the antitumor activity of DHA is
shown only in a relative high dose, which limits the antitumor
application in clinic. In our study, the combination of Onc and
DHA synergistically inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC and
MSTO cells and showed enhanced antitumor effects in mouse
xenograft models. The synergistic antitumor effect of Onc and
DHA allows a reduction in the drug dose, leading to lower side
effects. The synergistic effect also means an enhanced antitumor
activity at the same dose, thus suggesting a wide antitumor
application.
Our results revealed the potential of a novel therapeutic regi-
men using the Onc/DHA combination for cancer treatment. The
features of enhanced anti-angiogenesis activity of the Onc/DHA
combination with low toxicity and immunogenicity may also have
the potential in tumor preventive treatments, such as metronomic
chemotherapy, which is based on suppression of tumor angiogen-
esis. Metronomic chemotherapy shifts the main treatment target
from eliminating tumor cells to suppressing tumor angiogenesis,
thereby stopping tumor progression and inducing tumors into a
dormant state. Metronomic chemotherapy involves a lower dose of
the drug and no long drug-free breaks. This requires drugs with
low toxicity to patients and potent anti-angiogenesis activity. Our
results imply that the Onc/DHA combination may be a good candi-
date drug for metronomic chemotherapy because it meets these
requirements.
