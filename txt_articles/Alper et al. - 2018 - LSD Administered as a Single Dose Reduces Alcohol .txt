There is a substantive clinical literature on classical hallucinogens, most commonly
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. However,
there has been no published research on the effect of LSD on alcohol consumption in
animals. This study evaluated the effect of LSD in mice using a two-bottle choice alcohol
drinking paradigm. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to ethanol to develop
preference and divided into three groups of equal ethanol consumption, and then treated
with single intraperitoneal injection of saline or 25 or 50 µg/kg LSD and offered water
and 20% ethanol. The respective LSD-treated groups were compared to the control
group utilizing a multilevel model for repeated measures. In mice treated with 50 µg/kg
LSD ethanol consumption was reduced relative to controls (p = 0.0035), as was ethanol
preference (p = 0.0024), with a group mean reduction of ethanol consumption of 17.9%
sustained over an interval of 46 days following LSD administration. No signifi
cant effects
on ethanol consumption or preference were observed in mice treated with 25 µg/kg
LSD. Neither total fluid intake nor locomotor activity in the LSD-treated groups differed
signifi
cantly from controls. These results suggest that classical hallucinogens in the
animal model merit further study as a potential approach to the identifi
cation of targets
for drug discovery and investigation of the neurobiology of addiction.

INTRODUCTION
Alcohol-related disorders accounted for approximately 88,000 deaths annually and one in ten
deaths in working age adults in the US from 2006 to 2010 (Stahre et al., 2014), and are estimated
to cause 5.9% of deaths worldwide (World Health Organization, 2014). The 2012-2013 National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III found a 12-month prevalence of
alcohol use disorder (AUD) of 13.9% (Grant et al., 2015), and the economic cost of alcohol misuse
in the US in 2010 was estimated at $249 billion (Sacks et al., 2015).

LSD Reduces Alcohol Consumption in Mice
(Halberstadt, 2015), or “
psychedelics” (Nichols, 2016), are
reported to be effective in some clinical studies of AUD
(Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz et al., 2015), and
other substance use disorders (Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016).
Among the classical hallucinogens, LSD, the prototype of this
group of compounds, has the most extensive history of use in
clinical research on AUD (Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Liechti
et al., 2017). The literature on LSD for the treatment of AUD
extends back to the 1950s, and a meta-analysis that included
6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving a total of
536 subjects found that treatment with a single dose of LSD
significantly reduced alcohol misuse for up to three months
(Krebs and Johansen, 2012). This meta-analysis retrieved an
additional 23 non-RCT open-label studies, case reports, or studies
that did not otherwise meet inclusion criteria, indicating the
considerable extent of the historical interest in clinical research
on LSD for the treatment of AUD.
There is apparently no previously published work on the
effects of LSD on the self-administration of alcohol or other
abused substances in animals. In view of the elements of possible
relevance to addiction in the signaling cascade downstream from
the binding sites of LSD (Lopez-Gimenez and Gonzalez-Maeso,
2018), an effect of LSD on the self-administration of alcohol in
animals would provide support for the animal model as a possible
approach to target identification and drug discovery. This present
research focuses on the effect of LSD on alcohol intake in a two-
bottle choice drinking paradigm in C57BL/6J mice, an inbred
alcohol-preferring strain (Melo et al., 1996).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
This research was conducted in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health and Nathan Kline Institute Animal Care and
Use Committee’
s guidelines. All experiments were conducted in
adult male C57BL/6J mice (10–
18 weeks old; Jackson Laboratory,
United States). Mice were given unlimited access to standard
mouse chow and water throughout the entire study.
Ethanol Drinking Behavior
The effect of LSD on ethanol consumption was assessed using a
two-bottle choice drinking paradigm. Mice were housed singly
and habituated to reverse light-dark cycle for at least a week. The
mice were then exposed to ethanol to develop preference with
two bottles containing water and 20% ethanol offered for 24 h
in the beginning of the dark phase for five days a week (Monday
through Friday) for 4 weeks. The mice were then divided into
three groups of equal ethanol intake based on the amount of
ethanol consumed on the day before administration of either
saline or LSD (25 or 50 µg/kg body weight, i.p.) once before the
onset of the dark cycle. LSD was supplied by the NIDA Drug
Supply Program, Bethesda, MD, United States. Water bottles
were replaced with bottles containing water and ethanol after
10 min of treatment. Amounts of ethanol and water consumption
were measured every 24 h. The positions of water and ethanol
bottles were alternated every day to avoid place preference. Two
bottles containing water and 20% ethanol were placed in a cage
without a mouse to control for spillage and evaporation.
Locomotor Activity
Ambulatory activity was measured as ambulatory counts
(interruption of the total number of beams, on both the x
and y-axis) with an infrared beam-based activity sensor (ATM3;
Columbus Instrument, Columbus, OH, United States) over a 24-
h period beginning at the dark cycle at 1 and 8 days after the
administration of 50 µg/kg LSD or saline to ethanol-naïve mice.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS
R
� software Version
9.4, utilizing a multilevel model (MLM) for repeated measures
with PROC MIXED (SAS Institute Inc., 2018), and t-tests (one-
tailed) with p-value = 0.05 as the threshold for significance.
RESULTS
The interval of observation of ethanol intake was continued until
self-administration amounts of ethanol had reached equivalence,
defined as two consecutive days on which ethanol consumption
in the LSD-treated group equaled or exceeded the control group.
For the group treated with 25 µg/kg, equivalence was reached
at day 23; for the group treated with 50 µg/kg LSD it had not
been reached at the time the study was terminated on day 46.
For the group treated with 25 µg/kg LSD, the MLM independent
variables included time, group and the interaction between them
(to account for the change over time in the treated group). For
the group treated with 50 µg/kg LSD, the interaction was not
included because there was little evidence of change over time.
Ethanol consumption was decreased relative to controls in
the group treated with 50 µg/kg LSD (F = 11.99, df = 15,
p = 0.0035; Figure 1B), without a significant effect with 25 µg/kg
LSD (F = 3.08, df = 17, p = 0.0974; Figure 1A). Notably, the
effect appears to have been sustained across the 46-day interval
of observation. Likewise, ethanol preference, defined as ethanol
consumption/total fluid intake, (where total fluid is defined as
20% ethanol solution + water) was decreased relative to controls
in the 50 µg/kg LSD group (F = 13.32, df = 15, p = 0.0024;
Figure 1D), with no difference from control for the group treated
with 25 µg/kg LSD (F = 0.53, df = 17, p = 0.475; Figure 1C). Total
fluid intake did not differ from control in either the 25 µg/kg
LSD (F = 0.68, df = 17, p = 0.4204; Figure 1E) or 50 µg/kg LSD
(F = 1.30, df = 15, p = 0.2722; Figure 1F).
In the group treated with 50 µg/kg LSD, mean daily
ethanol consumption was 13.62 ± 3.02 g/kg/day compared to
16.60 ± 3.52 g/kg/day (mean ± SD) in controls (t = −1.86,
df = 15, p = 0.0414), and ethanol preference was 0.493 ± 0.104
versus 0.580 ± 0.091 in controls (t = −1.83, df = 15, p = 0.0436), a
17.9% reduction in the LSD-treated animals, without a significant
difference in mean daily total fluid intake. The group treated with
25 µg/kg LSD did not differ from control group with regard
to mean daily ethanol consumption or preference, or total fluid
intake.

50 (right column) µg/kg body weight, i.p. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 8–10 per group). Horizontal axis indicates the number of days following the
administration of LSD. The mice were divided into three groups of equal ethanol consumption based on the amount of ethanol consumed on the day before LSD
administration (day 0). LSD dosages were administered on day 1 [“injection,” as indicated in the top row panels (A,B)]. In the group treated with 50 µg/kg LSD, MLM
for repeated measures indicated signifi
cant reductions versus saline-treated controls in ethanol consumption (p = 0.0035) and preference (p = 0.0024). Differences
from control were not signifi
cant for the group treated with 25 µg/kg. Total fluid intake did not differ signifi
cantly from controls in either LSD-treated group (E,F) (See

LSD Reduces Alcohol Consumption in Mice
FIGURE 2 | Home cage ambulatory activity (beams broken X-Y) was measured for 24 h following the administration of LSD 50 µg/kg weight, i.p. to ethanol-naïve
mice on day 1 immediately following LSD administration (A) and 8 days later (B). Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 8 per group). LSD administration did not
signifi
cantly alter the ambulatory activity compared to saline treated mice on either day (See “Results” in text).
To evaluate a potential effect of LSD on ambulatory activity,
a group of ethanol-naïve mice were treated with 50 µg/kg LSD
or saline, and ambulatory counts were measured on day 1 and
8 (Figure 2). The result showed no significant difference in
locomotor activity comparisons between control versus the LSD-
treated group utilizing a MLM for hourly ambulatory counts on
day 1 (F = 0.74, df = 14, p = 0.4054) or day 8 (F < 0.01, df = 14,
p = 0.9907).
DISCUSSION
This study found reductions in both ethanol consumption and
preference in the group of mice treated with the LSD dosage
of 50 µg/kg. Although the magnitude of effect on ethanol
consumption was limited, with a group mean reduction of 17.9%,
it was sustained across a time interval of 46 days. Total fluid
intake and locomotor activity did not differ among the control
and LSD-treated groups, indicating that the observed effect on
ethanol self-administration was not an artifact of a global effect
on water or total fluid intake or possible differences in physically
approaching or self-administering fluid.
This is apparently the first study to report on the effects
of LSD on the self-administration of alcohol in animals. The
literature reporting on the effect of classical hallucinogens on
animal drug or alcohol self-administration is apparently limited
to a single study that found the classical hallucinogen 1-(2,5-
dimethoxy-4 iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) administered
intraperitoneally 15 min prior to a 12 h test session diminished
alcohol preference in a two-lever water versus ethanol choice
procedure in rats (Maurel et al., 1999). However, DOI is not
frequently used by humans and has some features such as a very
long half-life that would limit its generalizability to LSD, and the
available evidence raises questions regarding its safety in humans
(Kowalski and Salzman, 2012) relative to that of LSD (Nichols
and Grob, 2018).
Mechanisms that could logically be proposed to explain the
findings reported here include effects on G-protein coupled signal
transduction and downstream effectors, second messengers,
and gene expression (Halberstadt, 2015; Nichols, 2016; Lopez-
Gimenez and Gonzalez-Maeso, 2018; Martin and Nichols, 2018),
and a systematic exploration of these possibilities is well beyond
the scope of this discussion. Classical hallucinogens produce 5-
HT2AR desensitization (Nichols, 2016), and it has been suggested
that persistently reduced signaling in downstream pathways
linked to the 5-HT2AR might explain sustained effects observed
in clinical studies on substance use (Bogenschutz and Johnson,
2016) or mood and anxiety symptoms (Vollenweider and
Kometer, 2010; Ross et al., 2016).
Diminished signaling in downstream pathways linked to
the 5-HT2AR could increase transmission via metabotropic
glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) due to the reciprocally
inhibitory relationship between 5-HT2AR and GluR2/3 (Nichols,
2016). Increased transmission through mGluR2/3, which are
presynaptic and autoinhibitory on glutaminergic neurons, might
be expected to diminish alcohol intake in view of evidence
for mGluR2/3 agonists as possible pharmacotherapy for alcohol
dependence (Goodwani et al., 2017; Windisch and Czachowski,
2018). Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are
positively coupled to the 5-HT2AR, suggesting that a diminution
of 5-HT2AR signaling could have anti-addictive effects in view
of evidence linking ERK1/2 activation to neuroadaptations and
animal behaviors putatively associated with addiction (Girault
et al., 2007; Pascoli et al., 2014).
Work that could logically follow includes neurochemical
analysis aimed at identifying signaling pathways which might
mediate the effect of LSD on alcohol intake observed in this
study. Coupling among G proteins, phospholipase effectors and
the 5-HT2AR subsumes a set questions of current interest in
research on psychedelics. Although 5-HT2ARs classically couple
to Gαq/11, the effects of classical hallucinogens also apparently
involve Gαi/o (Lopez-Gimenez and Gonzalez-Maeso, 2018). Gi/o

LSD Reduces Alcohol Consumption in Mice
signaling interacts with brain region, for example alcohol intake
in C57BL/6 mice is decreased by activation of Gi/o protein that is
regionally expressed in the dorsal striatum (Robins et al., 2018).
Investigative approaches to identifying the signaling pathways
and cell populations involved may include measurement of
protein expression and function as well as intracerebral injection
of LSD in specific brain sites. Future studies may utilize alcohol-
related behaviors such as drinking-in-the dark, intermittent
access, or withdrawal to model AUD phenotypes (Leeman et al.,
2010).
The finding of reduced ethanol preference with LSD in a
rodent model suggests that the efficacy of LSD for the treatment
of AUD reported in clinical studies may be not fully explained by
psychological factors and involves a biologically mediated effect.
The settings in which LSD has been administered as treatment for
AUD are varied, including an RCT reporting positive results in
which patients were strapped to a bed in a hospital room (Smart
et al., 1966), suggesting that the effect of LSD on alcohol misuse
may have involved a pharmacological determinant distinct from
psychotherapeutic set and setting.
In view of the lack of prior published animal self-
administration studies using LSD, reference to other animal
behavioral paradigms may help contextualize the dosages of
LSD used in this present research. Two behavioral paradigms
appear relevant, the head twitch response (HTR) (Halberstadt
and Geyer, 2013) and discrimination (Nichols, 2016). Reported
ED50 dosages for correct responding to LSD in discrimination
studies in mice range from approximately 170 to 200 µg/kg
(Benneyworth et al., 2005; Winter et al., 2005; Krall et al.,
2008). Similarly, in studies of the HTR, a rapid side-to-side
rotational head movement in response to administered classical
hallucinogens that is thought to correspond with compounds
that produce psychedelic effects in humans, the maximum HTR
to LSD is seen at 200 µg/kg, and 50 µg/kg appears to be
approximately ED50 (Halberstadt and Geyer, 2013). The data
reported from discrimination and HTR studies of LSD suggest
that the dosages used in this study might not represent the
maximum of the dose response curve, which should be addressed
by evaluating higher dosages in future work.
In summary, this study found that LSD administered as
a single dose reduces ethanol consumption and preference
in C57BL/6J mice. These findings indicate that the apparent
effect of LSD in AUD observed in clinical samples may be
modeled in animals, suggesting the involvement of a biologically
mediated determinant, and support the potential utility of
classical hallucinogens in the animal model as a paradigm for
target identification in drug discovery and investigation of the
neurobiology of addiction.
