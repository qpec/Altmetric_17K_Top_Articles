Abstract
Background
Cervical total disc replacement (TDR) is an increasingly accepted procedure for the treatment of symptomatic cer-
vical degenerative disc disease. Multiple Level I evidence clinical trials have established cervical TDR to be a safe
and effective procedure in the short-term. The objective of this study is to provide a long-term assessment of TDR
versus anterior discectomy and fusion for the treatment of one- and two-level disc disease.
Methods
This study was a continuation of a prospective, multicenter, randomized, US FDA IDE clinical trial comparing
cervical TDR with the Mobi-C© Cervical Disc versus ACDF through 7 years follow-up. Inclusion criteria included
a diagnosis of symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease at one or two cervical levels. TDR patients were
treated using a Mobi-C© artificial disc (Zimmer Biomet, Austin TX, USA). ACDF with allograft and anterior plate
was used as a control treatment. Outcome measures were collected preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks,
at 3, 6, 12, 18 months, annually through 60 months, and at 84 months. Measured outcomes included Overall suc-
cess, Neck Disability Index (NDI), VAS neck and arm pain, segmental range of motion (ROM), patient satisfac-
tion, SF-12 MCS/PCS, major complications, and subsequent surgery rate. The primary endpoint was an FDA
composite definition of success comprising clinical improvement and an absence of major complications and sec-
ondary surgery events.
Results
A total of 599 patients were enrolled and treated, with 164 treated with one-level TDR, 225 treated with two-level
TDR, 81 treated with one-level ACDF, and 105 treated with two-level ACDF. At seven years, follow-up rates
ranged from 73.5% to 84.4% (overall 80.2%).
The overall success rates of two level TDR and ACDF patients were 60.8% and 34.2%, respectively (p<0.0001).
The overall success rates of one level TDR and ACDF patients were 55.2% and 50%, respectively (p>0.05). Both
the single and two level TDR and ACDF groups showed significant improvement from baseline NDI scores, VAS
neck and arm pain scores, and SF-12 MCS/PCS scores (p<0.0001). In the single level cohort, there was an in-
creased percentage of TDR patients who reported themselves as “very satisfied” (TDR 90.9% vs ACDF 77.8%; p=
0.028). There was a lower rate of adjacent level secondary surgery in the single level TDR patients (3.7%) versus
the ACDF patients (13.6%; p = 0.007).
In the two level TDR group, the NDI success rate was significantly greater in the TDR group (TDR: 79.0% vs.
ACDF: 58.0%; p=0.001). There was significantly more improvement in NDI change score at 7 years in the TDR
patients versus ACDF. The TDR group had a significantly higher rate of patients who were “very satisfied” with
their treatment compared to the ACDF group (TDR: 85.9% vs. ACDF: 73.9%). The rate of subsequent surgery at
the index level was significantly lower in the TDR group compared to the ACDF group (TDR: 4.4% vs. ACDF:

 16.2%; p=0.001). The rate of adjacent level secondary surgery was significantly lower in the two level TDR (4.4%)
patients compared to the ACDF (11.3%; p=0.03) patients. In both single and two level cohorts, the percentage of
patients with worse NDI (2.5%-3.8% of two level surgeries and 1.2%-2.5% of single level surgeries) or worse neck
pain (5%-6.8% of the two level surgeries and 1.3% - 3.8% of the single level surgeries) was strikingly low in both
groups but trended lower in the TDR patients.
Conclusions
At seven years, the composite success analysis demonstrated clinical superiority of two level TDR over ACDF and
non-inferiority of single level TDR versus ACDF. There were lower rates of secondary surgery and higher adjacent
level disc survivorship in both groups. Both surgeries were remarkably effective in alleviating pain relative to base-
line and the rate of patients with worse disability or neck pain was surprisingly low. Overall, greater than 95% of pa-
tients (from both groups) who underwent TDR and 88% of patients who underwent ACDF were “very satisfied”
at seven years. The differences in clinical effectiveness of TDR versus ACDF becomes more apparent as treatment
increases from one to two levels, indicating a significant benefit for TDR over ACDF for two-level procedures.
Ethical Standards
The Mobi-C Clinical Trial (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00389597) was conducted at 24 sites in
the US and was approved by the Institutional Review Board, Research Ethics Committee, or local equivalent of

Introduction
Neck and arm pain have shown to negatively impact
multiple facets of patient health1 and neck pain alone
remains one of the largest contributors to the overall
global heath burden.2 Since the mid-20th Century,
the standard surgical procedure for treating sympto-
matic cervical spondylosis has been anterior discec-
tomy and fusion (ACDF). While ACDF is a highly
effective procedure, there are two major, procedure-
specific complications: pseudoarthrosis and adjacent
segment degeneration (ASD).3
The causative relationship between ACDF and ASD
most likely lies in the kinematics and functionality of
the partially fused spine. As motion in treated seg-
ments is eliminated through fusion, adjacent seg-
ments become hypermobile and adjacent discs expe-
rience increased loads and stresses.4-7 In turn, these
kinematic changes have the potential to initiate or ac-
celerate pathologies in intact segments. Unfortunate-
ly, the immobility of treated segments is the very na-
ture of the fusion procedure, required for stabiliza-
tion after discectomy. As such, it seems only natural
to seek an alternative surgical technique in which
natural, healthy motion is preserved or restored.
Cervical total disc replacement (TDR) was devel-
oped in an effort to preserve natural spinal kinemat-
ics while providing mechanical stabilization after
neural decompression and discectomy. Several Level
I evidence randomized clinical trials have confirmed
both the safety and efficacy of TDR in both the
short- and long-term.8-14 TDR has shown to have
many possible advantages over ACDF including low-
er rates of subsequent surgical intervention,15,16 lower
rates of adjacent segment degeneration,13,17,18 and an
advantage in cost-effectiveness.19,20 Furthermore,
kinematic analyses have shown TDR to maintain
functional biomechanics at the level treated while
mitigating excess motion at adjacent segments.21
The purpose of this study is to expand on results
from the Mobi-C© Cervical Disc FDA IDE clinical
trial with 7-year data. Previously reported 2-13,22,
4-14,23, and 5-year24,25 follow-up results from this ran-

 domized clinical trial have shown equivalent or bet-
ter performance of TDR compared to ACDF at both
one and two levels of treatment. Here, we present
7-year results from the one and two level arms for a
comprehensive, long-term evaluation of TDR with
Mobi-C©.
Methods
Study Design and Patient Population
The study was a prospective, randomized multicen-
ter clinical trial conducted at 24 sites in the US. The
study was divided into two separate arms of one-level
and two-level treatment, conducted in tandem. En-
rollment criteria included a diagnosis of degenerative
disc disease with radiculopathy or myeloradiculopa-
thy at either one or two contiguous levels from C3 to
C7. General inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed
in Table 1.
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (investiga-
tional: control) and received surgery between April
2006 and March 2008. The investigational group
was treated with TDR using the Mobi-C© Cervical
Disc (Mobi-C, Zimmer Biomet, Austin, TX, USA)
(Figure 1). The control group received ACDF with
allograft and anterior plate. A total of 164 patients
were treated with one-level TDR, 81 with one-level
ACDF, 225 with two-level TDR, and 105 with two-
level ACDF. Surgeons were blinded up to the time of
the procedure and patients were blinded until after
surgery. Blinding afterwards was not possible due to
differences in postoperative recovery protocols and
the ability for patients to view their own radiographs.
Postoperative recovery schemes were left to the dis-
cretion of the treating surgeons. All patients were in-
structed to refrain from taking non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) a week before surgery
until 3 months post-surgery. Patients were followed
at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, annually to 5 years,
and then again at 7 years. A detailed description of
the study design, including surgical technique, has
been previously published by Davis et al (2013).13 A
CONSORT diagram is included in the Appendix.
Outcome Measures
Patient reported clinical outcomes included the neck
disability index (NDI), the visual analog scale (VAS)
for neck and arm pain, the short-form 12-item ques-
tionnaire (SF-12) for physical health (PCS) and men-
tal health (MCS), and a patient satisfaction survey.
For VAS arm pain, the mean improvement from
baseline is reported for the most symptomatic arm at
preoperative. In the event that a patient had equal
preoperative VAS arm pains scores, the improve-
ment in both arms was taken as the average improve-
ment of both arms. To account for differences at pre-
sentation between patients and facilitate explanation

 of the data to non-spine providers, recovery ratios
(RR) were calculated as the percentage difference be-
tween pre- and post-operative scores using the
method of Hirabayashi:26
RR = ([Follow−up score] − [Baseline score]) /
([Optimum score] − [Baseline score])
where optimum score is the best possible score for
that outcome measure (e.g. 0 for VAS, 100 for
SF-12). The recovery ratio represents the improve-
ment in outcome normalized to the patient’s baseline
outcome score relative to the possible improvement
in outcome.
Patients were asked two questions related to satisfac-
tion. For patient satisfaction, patients were surveyed
if they were “very satisfied,” “somewhat satisfied,”
“somewhat dissatisfied,” or “very dissatisfied” with
their treatment. Patients were also asked how likely
they were to recommend their respective surgery to a
friend with possible responses of “definitely,”
“probably,” “probably not,” and “definitely not.”
For the purposes of this investigation, high likelihood
to recommend was calculated as the proportion of
patients who answered “definitely yes” or “probably
yes” for the questionnaire.
Radiographic outcomes included measurements of
flexion-extension and lateral bending range of motion
(ROM), functional spinal unit height, heterotopic os-
sification, and adjacent segment degeneration. Het-
erotopic ossification was assessed using the grading
system adapted from McAfee and Mehren.27,28 Adja-
cent segment degeneration was assessed using the
grading system adapted from Kellgren and
Lawrence.29 A team of independent radiologists
(Medical Metrics, Inc., Houston, TX) made all radi-
ographic determinations.
Primary Success Endpoint
The primary endpoint for the study was a composite
definition of patient success. In order to be consid-
ered a success, a patient had to meet each of the fol-
lowing criteria:
• An improvement in NDI score of at least 30
points for a patient with a preoperative NDI score of
60 or greater; or an improvement of at least 50% of
preoperative NDI score for patients with a preopera-
tive score of less than 60;
• No subsequent surgical intervention at the index
level(s);
• No adverse events (AEs) classified as major com-
plications by a clinical events committee (CEC);
• Maintenance or improvement in neurologic func-
tion;
• Radiographic success.
All subsequent surgeries were collected and docu-
mented in detail consistent with previous descrip-
tions.13,15,24,25 The study protocol did not specify the
indications for reoperation in either treatment group.
The decision for subsequent surgical intervention
was determined solely by the treating surgeon and
the patient’s personal decision to proceed. Consis-
tent with other analyses,9,11,15,18 index-level secondary
surgeries were categorized when possible as a revi-
sion, removal, reoperation or supplemental fixation.
Essentially, any surgery that touched the index level
was considered as an index-level reoperation, even if
the primary goal of surgery was to correct an adja-
cent level problem. Secondary operations at adjacent
levels were documented as well. Thus, operations at
adjacent levels only were not considered in the pri-
mary success-or-failure study endpoint. However,
operations that involved both index and adjacent lev-
els were considered in the primary success or failure
study endpoint. For plate removals, if the plate was
removed from the index level to extend the fusion to
an adjacent level, this event was considered a re-
moval per the study protocol and considered a failure

 for the primary endpoint.
Adverse events (AEs) were defined as any clinically
adverse sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that oc-
curred or worsened during the operative and post-
operative period. AEs were assessed by a Clinical
Events Committee (CEC) composed of two orthope-
dic surgeons and one neurosurgeon. The members of
the CEC were not investigators on the study and
were blinded to treatment whenever possible. Any
patient with an AE that was determined by the CEC
to be a major complication of the treatment was con-
sidered a study failure.
Neurological assessments were performed by the in-
vestigator using tests of sensory, reflex, and motor
function. Any patient with a decrease in sensory, re-
flex, or motor function from preoperative status was
considered a failure.
For the TDR group, radiographic success was de-
fined as at least 2° of segmental motion in flexion-
extension or no evidence of bridging bone across the
disc space. Grade IV heterotopic ossification was an
indication of bridging bone. For the ACDF group, ra-
diographic success was defined as fusion of the treat-
ed level(s), less than 2° of segmental motion in
flexion-extension, and evidence of bridging bone
across the disc space with radiolucent lines at no
more than 50% of the graft vertebral interfaces.
Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint was assessed with the hypoth-
esis of non-inferiority of TDR versus ACDF with a
10% non-inferiority margin. Non-inferiority was test-
ed using a 95% one-sided lower confidence bound of
the difference between the investigation and the con-
trol group. A closed testing procedure was prespeci-
fied for superiority, to be tested in the event that non-
inferiority was confirmed. If non-inferiority was con-
firmed, superiority was tested using a 95% lower con-
fidence bound.
There were two distinct methods of outcome assess-
ment. To evaluate the change in outcomes specifical-
ly at seven years, p-values for differences in improve-
ment from baseline in NDI, VAS, and SF-12 scores at
84 months were calculated using repeated measures,
mixed effects ANOVA adjusted for multiplicity.
A global outcome assessment was also performed to
evaluate the aggregate change in outcome over the
entire seven year study period (inclusive of all of the
previous time points including two year, five year,
and seven year time points). Global p-values for dif-
ferences in absolute NDI, VAS, and SF-12 scores be-
tween TDR and ACDF were calculated using repeat-
ed measures, mixed effects ANOVA across all post-
operative time points.
Secondary surgery survival function estimates were
generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the
log-rank test to compare survival functions. Patients
undergoing a removal, revision, or supplemental fixa-
tion procedure were censored at all time points after
the surgery for secondary outcomes (e.g. NDI, VAS).
P-values for categorical endpoints were calculated
using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test. Statistical
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). All patients that were discon-
tinued (e.g. withdrawn, lost-to-follow-up, device re-
moval) were censored at their last follow-up prior to
study withdrawal. A scenario analysis was performed
to determine the potential influence of discontinued
patients, including last observation carried forward
(best-case scenario), and all discontinued patients
counted as failures (worst-case scenario analysis).
Under each scenario analysis, TDR remained either
superior or non-inferior to ACDF.
Results
Preoperative patient characteristics and clinical out-
comes were similar between treatment groups within
treatment arms (Table 2). The inclusion criteria re-
quired that patients smoke less than one pack per
day, but the preoperative smoking status of each pa-
tient was not collected as part of the study protocol.
However, a post-hoc survey conducted by the inves-
tigators estimated the proportion of smokers in the
study to be 15.1% for ACDF patients and 18.7% for
TDR patients.30 At 7 years, the follow-up rate was
84.4% for the two-level TDR group, and 75.0% for the
two-level ACDF group, and 80.1% for the one-level
TDR group and 74.3% for the one-level ACDF group.

Two-Level Treatment Arm
Primary Success Analysis – Two level
At 7 years, two-level TDR demonstrated superiority
compared to two-level ACDF (Figure 2). The rate of
success was 60.8% (104/171) in the TDR group and
34.6% (27/78) in the ACDF group with a difference
of 26.2% and lower 95% confidence bound of 15.4%.
Analyzing the individual components of success il-
lustrates that the primary driver of 2-level TDR su-
periority was due to a significant difference in per-
centage of successful NDI scores (TDR 79% vs
ACDF 58%), lower incidence of subsequent surgery
(4.4% vs 16.2%), and lower incidence of neurological
failure (6.4% vs 17.1%; Table 3). The differential suc-
cess of TDR was not attributable to differences in the
rate of adverse events or radiological deterioration
between groups.
Patient Reported Outcomes - Two level
Two-level TDR and ACDF patients had similar pre-
operative NDI scores, and NDI at all follow-ups was
significantly improved from baseline for both treat-

ments though seven years. Globally, TDR patients
had significantly lower NDI scores than ACDF pa-
tients (p<0.0001; Figure 3) averaged across all fol-
lowup periods. Specifically at the seven year fol-
lowup endpoint, the TDR group also had greater im-
provement in NDI scores (35.6±20) than the ACDF
group (28.2±21.7; p=0.04) at 7 years (Table 4). Con-
sidering the recovery ratios, NDI scores improved
67% over baseline in the TDR group and 53% in the
ACDF patients. For two-level patients, the most im-
proved NDI item was Pain Intensity for ACDF (2.0
points) and Recreation for TDR (2.4 points). For

VAS neck pain and arm pain scores, both groups im-
proved significantly compared to baseline by six
weeks and maintained the improvement averaged
across all followup periods (Figure 3). TDR patients
had significantly lower VAS neck pain scores than
ACDF patients averaged across all followup periods
(p=0.0002; Figure 3). At the specific 7 year followup
time-point, the TDR group showed a nonsignificant
trend toward more improvement in VAS neck scores
(50.9±30.6) than the ACDF group (44.1±39; p=0.21;
Table 4). At the 7 year followup endpoint, VAS neck
pain improved 72% over baseline in the TDR group
and 57% over baseline in the ACDF group. There was
no apparent difference between TDR and ACDF
with respect to VAS arm pain at the 7-year follow-up
endpoint (Table 4).
The vast majority of patients demonstrated improve-
ment in NDI in the two level cohort (80% TDR and
70.2% ACDF; Table 5) and there was a strikingly low
percentage of patients who had worse NDI scores
(2.7% TDR and 3.8% ACDF; p=0.10). Overall, the

larly, there was a strikingly low percentage of patients
who had worse NDI scores in both the two level co-
hort (5% TDR and 6.8% ACDF) and the single level
cohort (3.8% TDR and 1.3% ACDF; Table 5).
Both patient groups saw a significant improvement in
SF-12 PCS/MCS scores from baseline. TDR had sig-
nificantly higher postoperative SF-12 PCS scores av-
eraged across all time points (p=0.0003), but SF-12
MCS scores were similar in both treatment groups
(Figure 3). At the specific seven year time point,
there were no statistically significant differences in
SF12 PCS or MCS scores.

 Overall patient satisfaction was high in both groups
with high proportions of patients in both groups de-
scribing themselves as “very satisfied” [TDR: 86.0%
(160/186) vs. ACDF: 73.9% (51/69); p = 0.039].
However, a higher proportion TDR patients an-
swered they would “definitely” or “probably” rec-
ommend their treatment to a friend, when compared
to the ACDF group [TDR: 96.8% (179/185) vs.
ACDF: 88.4% (61/69); p = 0.025].
Radiographic Outcomes - Two level
The TDR grouped maintained range of motion in
flexion/extension and lateral bending at both treated
levels (Figure 4). Both groups experienced a margin-
al decrease in functional spinal unit height relative to
postoperative measurements at both the superior and
inferior treated levels (Table 6). For 2-level TDR pa-
tients, bridging bone at either level was present in
11.1% of patients (6.5% superior level/4.7% inferior
level). At 7 years, 90.9% of ACDF patients met the
criteria for radiographic fusion. Both groups experi-
enced adjacent segment degeneration. However, the
ACDF group presented with double the prevalence
of radiographic degeneration compared to the TDR
group at both the inferior (TDR 30.3% vs ACDF
66.7%) and superior (TDR 37.5% vs ACDF 80.8%) ad-
jacent levels, respectively (Table 6).

 did at both the treated and adjacent levels. By 7
years, subsequent surgeries at the treated level, de-
fined as any reoperation, revision, removal, or sup-
plemental fixation, occurred in 4.4% (10/225) of
TDR patients and 16.2% (17/105) of ACDF patients
(p = 0.0008). The TDR secondary surgeries were
Removal (5), Reoperation (2), Revision (2) and Sup-
plemental Fixation (1). Among ACDF patients, the
secondary surgeries were Removal (8), Revision (4),
Supplemental Fixation (3) and Reoperation (2). Dis-
counting the plate removals at the index level (pre-
sumably to be able to access adjacent level patholo-
gy), the adjusted index level secondary surgery rate
for ACDF was 10.5% for two-level. The most com-
mon reason for additional surgical intervention at the
index level(s) was persistent radiculopathy and/or
neck pain (n = 7) and pseudoarthrosis (n = 9), for the
TDR and ACDF group, respectively. In the TDR
group, there was one case of device migration that
was asymptomatic, and one case of instability of the
TDR due to over-preparation of the vertebral end-
plate that required surgical intervention. Subsequent
surgeries that involved at least one adjacent level oc-
curred in 4.4% (10/225) of TDR patients and 11.4%
(12/105) of ACDF patients (p = 0.03). The most
common reason for additional surgical intervention
at an adjacent level was adjacent level disease or her-
niation for both the TDR (n = 10) and ACDF (n = 8)
group. Kaplan-Meier survival function estimates
demonstrated that TDR patients were less likely to

Primary Success Analysis - Single level
Based on the FDA required measure of composite
success, there was no significant difference in overall
success between TDR and ACDF in the single level
cohort patients. Therefore, one-level TDR demon-
strated non-inferiority compared to one-level ACDF
at 7 years (Table 7; Figure 6). The rate of success
was 55.2% (64/116) in the TDR group and 50.0% (25/
50) in the ACDF group with a difference of 5.2% and
lower 95% confidence bound of the difference of
-8.7%. The main driver of the (nonsignificant) differ-
ence in success rates was a significantly lower inci-
dence of subsequent surgery at the index level in
TDR patients (TDR 3.0% vs ACDF 12.3%; Table 7).

 Patient Reported Outcomes - Single level
Mean NDI scores improved significantly for both
groups by six weeks, and improvement was main-
tained though seven years in both groups compared
to baseline (Figure 7). There was no statistically sig-
nificant difference between groups in global NDI in
the single level cohort averaged across all time points
(p=0.11). While the TDR group showed greater im-
provement at early time points, both groups demon-
strated comparable mean NDI scores and mean NDI
improvement from baseline (TDR 35.4±20.6 vs
ACDF 33.8±20.2; p=0.99) at the specific seven year
endpoint (Table 8). On average, NDI recovery ratios
improved 67% over baseline in the TDR patients and
64% over baseline in the ACDF patients. For one-
level patients, the most improved NDI item was
Recreation for both ACDF (2.4 points) and TDR
(2.4 points). Both the mean improvement (35 points)
and the recovery ratio (67%) are strikingly similar in
the one- and two-level TDR cohorts. Similarly, for
VAS neck pain and arm pain scores, both groups saw
a significant improvement from baseline by six
weeks, which was maintained through seven years
(Table 8). There was no statistically significant dif-
ference in global VAS neck pain in the single level co-
hort averaged across all time points. The TDR group

showed a greater level of VAS Neck Pain improve-
ment at early time points, but this difference attenu-
ated at the seven year endopint, where both groups
showed a similar level of pain score improvement
(TDR 51.1±33 vs ACDF 48.2±30; Table 8). Overall,
both groups of patients had similar VAS neck pain re-
covery ratios (71% TDR vs 67% ACDF). Again, the
single level TDR VAS neck pain improvement
(51±33) and recovery ratio (71%) was strikingly simi-
lar to the two-level cohort (Table 8). There was a sig-
nificantly lower global VAS arm pain in the TDR co-
hort averaged across all time points (p=0.03). How-
ever, at the specific 7 year endpoint, there was no sig-
nificant difference in VAS arm pain between groups
(p=0.35, Table 8).
In the single level cohort, the vast majority of pa-
tients demonstrated improvement in NDI (84.6%
TDR and 84.8% ACDF). Similarly, there was a strik-
ingly low percentage of patients who had worse NDI
scores in the single level cohort (1.2% TDR and 2.5%

tients demonstrated improvement in VAS neck pain

Overall, patients saw a significant improvement in

Range of motion at the level treated was maintained
in the TDR group with an average range of motion of
10.2±6.3° in flexion/extension and 5.1±3.5° in lateral
bending (Figure 8). As expected, the average range of
motion for the ACDF group was 1° or less in both
flexion/extension and lateral bending at the level
treated (Table 10). Both groups experienced a mar-
ginal decrease in functional spinal unit height relative
to baseline postoperative measurements (Table 10).
Bridging bone was present in 11.1% (12/108) of TDR
patients. By 7 years, 95.5% of ACDF patients had
achieved radiographic fusion. Both groups experi-
enced adjacent segment degeneration, defined as at
least one increase in Kellgren-Lawrence grade from
baseline. However, the ACDF group demonstrated a
noticeably greater prevalence of adjacent segment

treated level occurred in 3.0% (5/164) of TDR pa-
tients and 12.3% (10/81) of ACDF patients (p =
0.008). The TDR secondary surgeries were Removal
(4) and Reoperation (1). The ACDF secondary surg-
eries were for Removal (7) or Supplemental Fixation
(3). Discounting the plate removals at the index level
(presumably to access adjacent level pathology), the
adjusted index level secondary surgery rate for
ACDF was 6.2% for one-level. The most common
reason for additional surgical intervention at the in-
dex level was persistent radiculopathy and/or neck
pain (n = 3) and pseudoarthrosis (n = 5), for the TDR
and ACDF group, respectively. There were no cases
of device malfunction, though there was one instance
where the TDR device was malpositioned and re-
quired additional surgical intervention. Additionally,
there was one case in which gross motion of the cau-
dal endplate of the TDR device was noted between
flexion and extension radiographs at 3 months. It was
concluded that the TDR device loosened from the
vertebral endplate. Thus due to over distraction of
the spinal segment, possibly caused by an oversized
implant; the patient had the device removed and re-
placed with fusion. The surgeon-investigator opined
that the loosening might have occurred due to over-
sizing and/or over distraction of the implant. Subse-
quent surgeries that involved at least one adjacent
level occurred in 3.7% (6/164) of TDR patients and
13.6% (11/81) of ACDF patients (p = 0.007). The
most common reason for additional surgical inter-
vention at an adjacent level was adjacent level disease
or herniation for both the TDR (n = 4) and ACDF (n
= 8) group. Kaplan-Meier survival function estimates
demonstrated that TDR patients were less likely to
have subsequent surgery across time (Figure 9).
Discussion
These results indicate that cervical spine surgery for
properly selected patients with myelopathy or radicu-
lopathy is tremendously effective at improving pa-
tient pain and quality of life. Overall, greater than
95% of patients (from both groups) who underwent
TDR and 88% of patients who underwent ACDF
were “very satisfied” at seven years. When compar-
ing TDR to ACDF, these results add to the growing
body of literature supporting the long-term outcome
and decreased secondary surgery rate of TDR com-

Although the change in disease specific outcome
measures and statistical testing is of value to the sci-
entific community, patients may struggle to under-
stand the specific implications of this data. As one re-
cent study reported, “interpretation of the data is
very difficult or even impossible for most patients
due to lack of adequate knowledge.” “From a pa-
tients perspective a total NDI score or a difference in
NDI score, that is however important for scientific
evaluation, is meaningless. It will not help him/her in
decision-making about any treatment for neck-
related problems.”32 Therefore, in this study, we
have attempted to transform the outcome scores into
expressions that can easily be understood by patients
to help them in making a decision about their eventu-
al treatment. Here we report that the vast majority of
patients in both single and two level cohorts im-
proved in neck disability after surgery (70.2%-80.8%
of two-level surgeries and 84.6%-84.8% of single level
surgeries) and neck pain (83.3%-87.5% of single level
surgeries and 77.7%-86.0% of two-level surgeries).
In contrast to the conventional wisdom of “50 per-
cent improved and 50 percent worse” outcome dis-
tribution, the percentage of patients with worse neck
disability (2.5%-3.8% of two-level surgeries and
1.2%-2.5% of single level surgeries) and worse VAS
neck pain (5%-6.8% of two-level and 1.3% - 3.8% of sin-
gle level) was strikingly low. To further facilitate pa-
tient education and individualized treatment ap-
proaches, the data in this study are also reported in
terms of recovery ratios. A higher recovery ratio im-
plies more improvement in outcome normalized to
maximal possible improvement. For instance, a pa-
tient with a preoperative NDI of 80 and a postopera-
tive NDI of 20 would have a 75% recovery ratio. In
this study, patients who underwent two-level total
disc replacement experienced a mean 72% reduction
in neck pain, 74% improvement in arm pain, and 67%
improvement in disability relative to an idealized im-
provement. Similarly, patients in this study who un-
derwent a single-level total disc replacement experi-
enced a mean 71% reduction in neck pain, 73% im-
provement in arm pain, and 67% improvement in dis-
ability relative to maximal possible improvement. We
believe that it is imperative that our clinical trial re-
sults be translated into lay language to aid patients,
non-spine providers such as insurance medical direc-
tors, and policy makers in their decision-making.
There was a clear reduction in secondary surgery
rates following TDR at long-term follow-up in both
the single and two level cohorts. Index level sec-
ondary surgery rates were significantly lower in the
TDR population at seven years in the single level
(3.0% TDR vs 12.3% ACDF) and two level (4.4%
TDR vs 16.2% ACDF) when all index level proce-
dures (including plate removal) were included. Radi-
ographic pseudoarthrosis was present in 9.1% of the
2-level ACDF patients and 4.5% of the single level
ACDF patients who did not undergo secondary
surgery by seven years. The rate of secondary surg-

 eries due to pseudoarthrosis was 8.6% for 2-level and
6.2% for one-level. Adjacent segment secondary
surgery rates were also significantly lower in the
TDR patients in the single level (3.7% TDR vs 13.6%
ACDF) and two level (4.4% TDR vs 11.4% ACDF)
patients. The difference in adjacent level secondary
surgery rates is consistent with the observed increase
in radiographic adjacent segment disease rates in the
ACDF patients.
Our data are consistent with other Level I evidence
clinical trials that have reported on the safety and ef-
ficacy of TDR with follow-up periods up to 7 years.33
Overall, the results have been favorable for TDR,
with results comparable to or better than ACDF con-
trol groups. In a 7-year study on the ProDisc-C de-
vice, Janssen et al. reported comparable results of
one-level TDR compared to ACDF with respect to
disease specific outcomes.9 Additionally, investiga-
tors observed a lower rate of subsequent surgical pro-
cedures at both the treated level and adjacent levels.9
Burkus et al. published similar 7-year findings on the
Prestige device with comparable or better outcomes
for the TDR group with almost three times fewer in-
dex and adjacent level surgeries in the disc group.18
In a 5-year study on the PCM device, Phillips et al.
reported better outcomes for neck pain, similar AE
rates, and lower rates of subsequent surgery and radi-
ographic degeneration for their one-level disc group
compared to ACDF controls.11 Although some early
studies of other discs did not report a statistically sig-
nificant difference in secondary surgery rates at early
time points, long-term follow-up has demonstrated
that motion preservation reduces secondary surgery
rates.
While several high-quality studies have validated the
long-term safety and efficacy of one-level TDR, to
the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of two
high-quality, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the
long-term performance of two-level TDR. The re-
sults of other, short-term studies, while limited in
quantity, are in accordance with these results pre-
sented here. In a prospective, randomized, 65-patient
study of two-level TDR versus ACDF, Chen et al.
demonstrated favorable outcomes for two-level TDR
(Bryan), with significantly more improvement in
NDI and neck pains scores over an ACDF compari-
son group at two years.34
The dramatic difference seen between TDR and fu-
sion when moving from one-level to two-levels of
treatment is also noteworthy.35 As discussed in the
results, the outcome of TDR is remarkably similar at
one and two levels. Although there previously was a
statistically significant difference between single level
TDR and ACDF, at long term follow-up the differ-
ences in success rate, NDI score, VAS score, and
other clinical outcome measures are no longer statis-
tically significant. While one-level treatment with
TDR offered similar results in patient reported out-
comes versus ACDF in the long-term, a sizeable dif-
ference in treatment effectiveness was observed be-
tween two-level TDR and ACDF. Treatment with
ACDF appeared to experience diminishing returns
as the number of treated levels increases, while TDR
does not, or does to a much lesser extent.35,36 A likely
explanation for this phenomenon lies in the apparent
biomechanical differences between fusion and disc
replacement.7,37,38 In accordance with this hypothesis
of transfer of biomechanical stresses in multilevel
disc replacement, there was a striking difference in
the recovery ratios of VAS neck pain between
groups. In the single level cohort, neck pain im-
proved on average 67% relative to idealized improve-
ment from baseline score. In the two level group,
neck pain improved only 57%. Therefore, although
the difference in mean VAS improvement is small (4
points on a 0-100 scale), there was a 10% difference in
the recovery ratio. Additionally, there was an in-
crease in the incidence of radiographic adjacent seg-
ment degeneration in the ACDF patients between
cohorts (2-level 80.8% vs 65.1% 1-level). The ob-
served increase in radiographic degeneration is also
in accordance with the theory that there is increased
mechanical stress following two level fusion.
There is no doubt that ACDF is still a highly useful
and successful procedure, especially for treating
symptomatic spondylosis accompanied by marked
cervical instability, facet arthropathy, disc space col-
lapse, or kyphosis. One limitation of this study was
the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for entry
into the study. At the time of conception, the inten-
tion of the Mobi-C study was to enroll patients with-
out significant conditions that could confound the

 outcome of an artificial disc. Other studies have
demonstrated that less than half of the patients who
present to a spine surgeon’s office with cervical spine
complaints are candidates for a TDR based upon
IDE study criteria.39 Therefore, the generalizability
of these results to patients outside of IDE study con-
ditions may be limited. There may also be other vari-
ables that affect the outcome of TDR that were not
captured in this report. As the understanding of
TDR has improved since the conception and initia-
tion of this study almost 10 years ago, several techni-
cal factors have been identified that may be potential
confounders. For example, a retrospective analysis of
the Discover disc revealed that a preoperative disk
height of <3.5 mm or excessive intraoperative lordo-
sis, (such as increasing the functional spinal unit an-
gle by >3 degrees) was associated with a 3.5 times
greater risk of not achieving the MCID in NDI
(p=0.016).40 Another recent study demonstrated that
subtle micromotion between the implant and the ver-
tebral endplates (less than the threshold for macro-
motion and migration described as an adverse event
above) might affect clinical outcome. 41 There-
fore, there may also be subtle surgical factors, such as
height,42 alignment,43,44 or removal of the PLL,44,45
that may affect TDR kinematics and that limit the
generalizability of the results.44 Additionally, we ac-
knowledge that the indications and rate of secondary
surgery are somewhat subjective. One group of au-
thors reported a higher rate of secondary surgery in
ACDF patient within an IDE study than a concur-
rent group of ACDF patients outside of IDE study
conditions.46 The authors inferred that IDE study
conditions might lead to a subtle bias towards in-
creased rates of secondary surgery in ACDF patients
who would otherwise be managed without surgery.
Although we acknowledge possible bias in the subjec-
tive decision on the part of the surgeon and patient
to consider a secondary surgery, we also report con-
cordant clinical failure measured in objective para-
meters such as radiographic adjacent segment dis-
ease rates and clinical outcome measures. We believe
it is entirely reasonable that, in a group of patients
with an increased rate of radiographic degeneration
and worse clinical outcomes, we would observe an
increased rate of secondary surgery. Additionally, at
least 47% of secondary surgeries were performed by
non-investigator surgeons, which may also reduce
likelihood of investigator bias. The FDA composite
success endpoint (that consists of clinical and radi-
ographic measures) is an attempt to capture all treat-
ment failures, including secondary surgeries or pa-
tients who have a poor outcome who choose not to
undergo secondary surgery. All IDE clinical trials of
TDR have used a composite success endpoint to test
for non-inferiority against ACDF; however, the defi-
nition of overall success has varied among these
studies.47 The composite success endpoint used the
Mobi-C trial was mandated by the FDA from the be-
ginning of the IDE and has been reported in earlier
studies.23 At various times during this study, howev-
er, the FDA imposed alternative definitions of overall
success.24,25 For the purposes of this study, we used
the original FDA definition of success criteria. How-
ever, we acknowledge that, due to the small changes
in FDA definitions of success, direct comparisons of
overall success rates across studies may not be valid.
Another limitation is that the study was funded by
industry. Some authors perceive industry funding to
induce a source of bias, although this is true for all
medical device studies. Most spine device trials, par-
ticularly multicenter studies, are industry funded.48
Additionally, authors have declared potential con-
flicts of interest. Another source of bias was affirma-
tion bias or confirmation bias, although that is proba-
bly true for most medical device studies. Due to the
differences in postoperative rehabilitation, it was not
possible to blind patients to their treatment alloca-
tion. For treating symptomatic spondylosis in which
the spine is generally stable, these data suggest that
the stability provided by fusion is not worth the sacri-
fice in motion. With an apparent reduced risk for re-
operation and adjacent segment pathologies, motion-
preserving treatment with TDR seems to be an ex-
cellent alternative to ACDF, given the data presented
here and in many other studies.
Conclusion
For the treatment of one- or two-level symptomatic
cervical disc disease, TDR with the Mobi-C Cervical
Disc is a safe procedure with excellent long-term ef-
fectiveness. Compared to an anterior fusion alter-
ative, TDR provided a similar reduction in patient
reported outcomes of pain and function while pro-
viding a lower risk for reoperation at both treated and

 adjacent levels. The improvement in outcome be-
tween TDR and ACDF appears to be durable from
the two-year to the seven-year follow up. The differ-
ence in clinical effectiveness of TDR versus ACDF
becomes more apparent as treatment increases from
one to two levels, indicating a significant benefit for
TDR over ACDF for two-level procedures.
