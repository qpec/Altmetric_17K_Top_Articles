Both high grip strength and being married independently relate to better functional capacity and health at older
ages, but the combined effect of marital status and strength have not been investigated. Especially at older ages,
declining strength can have adverse health and social consequences, where having a spouse could potentially
help with everyday support and alleviate some of the negative effects of sarcopenia. We investigate how grip
strength relates to being married among two cohorts of 59–71 year olds (born 1923-35 and 1936-48) in the
Norwegian city of Tromsø, controlling for a broad set of health variables and sociodemographic characteristics.
The baseline included N = 5009 participants of whom 649 died during follow-up. We find that for men, par-
ticularly among younger cohorts, the physically stronger are more likely to be married, but no relation is found
for women. This is consistent with a hypothesis that women increasingly have selected male marital partners
based on preferred individual traits, whereas men do not emphasize strength when selecting women. We find
that both marital status and grip strength independently affect mortality, but there is no significant joint effect.
However, the distribution of strength and marital status implies that more men than women and increasing
shares of later born cohorts have a “double-burden” of low strength and a lack of support from a spouse.
Introduction
Understanding the relationship between marriage and functional
level requires that we can explain how men and women are sorted into
marriage as well as how health trajectories may be subsequently af-
fected by the presence or influence of a spouse. Evidence from Norway
indicates that mortality risks are elevated for those who are not mar-
ried, particularly for men (Berntsen, 2011). Researchers generally agree
that married people enjoy better health and longevity, although the
health ‘premium’ of marriage also appears to be larger for men than
women (Aizer et al., 2013; Lamb, Lee, & DeMaris, 2003; Lillard &
Waite, 1995; Robles, 2014).
The mechanisms responsible for better health among the married
are also thought to differ for men and women. Whereas husbands
benefit more from improved behavioral risk profiles, wives benefit from
the greater financial security provided by their husbands (Reczek,
Pudrovska, Carr, Thomeer, & Umberson, 2016). Wives encourage
healthier behaviors and preventive care, while discouraging unhealthy
lifestyles and providing social support. In contrast, wives benefit from
enhanced economic circumstances and health benefits that stem from
the additional resources that a joint household represents, particularly
if they are not employed themselves (Waldron, Hughes, & Brooks,
1996).
Both men and women, however, are likely to benefit from spousal
support in the wake of impairments or disability. Studies on the topic
generally rely on measures of health that are subjective, such as self-
rated health, or are dependent on clinical diagnoses of specific diseases.
The risk of early mortality among those with lower levels of social
support was, according to a meta-analyses of 50 studies, 30% greater
than the risk among those with higher support - and support from fa-
mily is more beneficial than support given by friends for both men and
women, especially at older ages (Shor, Roelfs, & Yogev, 2013).
Marriage formation along cohort lines
As health and longevity improve and women become more finan-
cially independent, partnering trends also appear to be changing.
Norwegian women are decreasingly likely to marry for economic rea-
sons or due to social pressure (Toulemon, 2016). The growth in female
education and economic activity and rapid cultural change in family

T
 norms have been taking place alongside a postponement and decline in
marriage (Lesthaeghe, 2014). High GDP per capita and extensive social
support systems (including lower taxes for those who are single) makes
marriage in Norway less of an economic necessity (Baran, Diehnelt, &
Jones, 2014). High levels of contraceptive use (the contraceptive pill
was legalized 1967 in Norway) have contributed to lower social pres-
sures for marriage, fewer marriages resulting from unplanned preg-
nancies, and higher proportions of people who choose not to marry
(Rijken & Liefbroer, 2016). That marriage in Norway has become an
option rather than an expectation makes Norway an appropriate setting
in which to assess changing marital behavior and its implications. With
often longer dating periods preceding marital decisions, individual
traits, including health, are likely to become more important predictors
of marital outcomes (Jokela, Rotkirch, Rickard, Pettay, & Lummaa,
2010; Watson & McLanahan, 2011). For instance, personality has be-
come more important among recent cohorts, e.g., the negative asso-
ciation between male neuroticism and the likelihood of family forma-
tion has grown stronger among those born more recently (Skirbekk &
Blekesaune, 2013).
The potential importance of selection into marriage as a competing
explanation for the health advantages of marriage has been recognized
for long periods. Those who are ill or have fewer resources are generally
less likely to marry (Farr, 1859; Umberson, 1987), suggesting that
mortality differences related to marital status also could result from
other factors, such as health related selection in terms of who get
married (Goldman, 1993). Although some suggest that lower rates of
marriage could signal a decline in the strength of the relationship be-
tween marriage and health, this is not necessarily the case. The pro-
tective association of marriage to mortality has been found to remain
high (or increase) even when marriage is becoming less prevalent, as
the case has been in Norway (Kravdal, Grundy, & Keenan, 2018; Van
den Berg & Gupta, 2015).
Grip strength and health cohort lines
Grip strength is a central dimension of health and ability to cope
independently (Hirsch, Bůžková, Robbins, Patel, & Newman, 2012).
Grip strength predicts the risk of cardiovascular diseases and mortality
(Hirsch et al., 2012; Strand et al., 2016) and is most important for
health at older ages, due to age-related decline and implications for
mobility (Alley et al., 2014; Stephan, Chalabaev, Kotter-Grühn, &
Jaconelli, 2013). Age-related declines in handgrip-strength are more
pronounced when samples of the 65-and-older are adjusted for mor-
tality attrition (Stenholm et al., 2012). However, even among the oldest
old, later born cohorts may perform better. Successive cohorts of 90+
year olds Denmark increased their grip strength slightly, from 16.1 to
16.2 kg for the 1905 to the 1915 cohort observed 10 years later at the
same age (Christensen, Jeune, Andersen-Ranberg, & Vaupel, 2013). A
US based study found that, on average, men and women attain peak
grip strength at the same age (36 years). Women’s decline in grip
strength occurs sooner (age 50 years for women and 56 years for men),
but men lose grip strength at a faster rate relative to their peak. There is
an increasing secular trend in peak grip strength that is not attributable
to concurrent secular trends in body size, and the grip strength trajec-
tory varies with birth weight (men only), smoking (men only), alcohol
consumption (men and women), and sports activity (women only)
(Nahhas et al., 2010).
Physical grip strength is also associated with social outcomes, in-
cluding economic activity (Kalwij & Vermeulen, 2008). Higher muscle
strength reduces physical disability at older ages and relates to higher
levels of overall wellbeing (Cooper et al., 2014). Strength also allows
for greater physical mobility, the capacity to be socially active, and to
enjoy a good quality of life (Sayer et al. 2006). Greater grip strength is
linked to lower risks of heart disease and fractures - especially at older
ages (Cooper, Kuh, & Hardy, 2010). Recently a strong association be-
tween low grip strength and all-cause as well as cardiovascular
mortality was identified in the Tromsø study, with an equally strong
association for men and women and across age groups (Strand et al.,
2016). Long term care residents were significantly more likely to die if
they had sarcopenia (Landi et al., 2012). Poor grip strength has been
found to be associated with an extended length of hospital stay, parti-
cularly among patients aged 65 years and above (Sousa, Guerra,
Fonseca, Pichel, & Amaral, 2015).
Improvements in grip strength across successive cohorts, as shown
in Denmark (Kaare Christensen et al., 2013), could reflect changes in
work task demands, mobility requirements and physical activity pat-
terns, as well as the disease burden (Autor, Levy, & Murnane, 2003;
Gordo and Skirbekk, 2013). More calorie rich diets and rising birth
weights may boost muscle strength along cohort lines (Midthjell et al.,
2013), while other factors such as more sedentary lifestyles and
growing obesity could potentially lead to lowered strength (Schaap,
Koster, & Visser, 2013).
Interaction between spousal support, health related behaviours and low
strength
Spousal support can be particularly important if one partner is frail
and requires assistance to remain in the home and have a good quality
of life. For men, marital effects on lifestyle can have improve physical
strength by increasing the quality and nutritional value of the food they
consume – e.g., singles are more likely to consume processed food
(Wilson, 2012), and regular meals (Huang et al., 2014). Moreover,
those who are married tend to have more sex, which is associated with
better health and a higher levels of wellbeing (Müller, Nienaber, Reis,
Kropp, & Meyer, 2014).
Examining cohort differences in the association between being
married and grip strength can provide new insight into what underlies
union formation patterns, and whether grip strength is implied in such
decisions across cohorts. Health characteristics of those not married
could differ across cohorts – e.g., widowed Swiss men and women re-
ported similar depression levels but fewer social difficulties in 2011
compared to 1979 (Perrig-Chiello, Spahni, Höpflinger, & Carr, 2015). If
low grip strength and poor health increasingly characterize the un-
married, this could have important consequences for their ability to live
independently (Alley et al., 2014; Thomeer, Mudrazija, & Angel, 2016).
Increases in the population share who have both low physical strength
(a proxy for health) and at the same time lack spousal support may
influence the share of the population who are dependent on health
services and care facilities.
Gender differences in partner selection and the relevance of physical strength
Women and men may seek different traits when searching for a life
companion, which could imply different selection mechanisms for those
who eventually marry. Analyses of online dating profiles identified
certain traits that women and men tend to emphasize when they search
for a partner: Men are more likely than women to seek attractiveness, to
mention own economic wealth, and to profess an interest in marriage.
Women often seek life companions of high socioeconomic status
(Greenwood, Guner, Kocharkov, & Santos, 2014), and grip strength
may represent one cue to potential status. Women tend to stress own
attractiveness and beauty, and many women express a wish to find a
companion with sufficient economic means (Strassberg & English,
2015). Recent labour market changes suggest that men’s strength may
be a declining indicator of work productivity (Gordo & Skirbekk, 2013).
Therefore, women may care less about male strength if their goal is to
improve financial outcomes. Further, increased female work partici-
pation and growing income would suggest that women should be less
concerned with income (OECD, 2012). Yet, the positive relationship
between health and strength can imply that women may seek stronger
men as strength is a cue to longevity and health.
Surveys suggest that men with greater physical strength are

 perceived by others to have higher level positions, regardless of their
actual situation (Lukaszewski, Simmons, Anderson, & Roney, 2015).
Physically stronger men tend to have more sexual partners (Gallup,
White, & Gallup, 2007). Moreover – also in the Nordic countries –
women perform more of the household chores, while men are often
responsible for some of the physically heavy, but more episodic tasks
(e.g., house repairs, car maintenance, handling large items and as-
sembling furniture) (Lundberg, 2008). The male ideal may, also among
contemporary cohorts of women and men, may still be one who is a
provider and protector, who is being both emotionally and physically
strong (Powers & Reiser, 2005).
Data and methods
The current study investigates the relationship of marital status to
grip strength as observed in a representative sample. We observe two
successive cohorts born 1923-35 and 1936-48. Respondents are from
two independent samples drawn at different time points (1994/95 and
2007/08). Data are from a population-based study from the Norwegian
city of Tromsø (Tromsø 4 and Tromsø 6) (Jacobsen, Eggen, Mathiesen,
Wilsgaard, & Njølstad, 2012). We assess the association between re-
spondents’ marital status and grip-strength when respondents were
aged 59 to 71. These data were matched with the Norwegian national
death registry which includes all deaths for the respondents during 9.1
years of follow-up time for each cohort. Thus, max follow-up was until
2004 for the oldest born cohort and 2016 for the youngest born cohort.
The Tromsø Study is a population based health examination study of
Tromsø, the largest city in northern Norway. The study was initiated in
1974, and for our study we used data from its fourth and sixth study
wave in 1994-5 and 2007-8 (Jacobsen et al., 2012), respectively. Re-
sponse rates have remained high and were 75% in Tromsø 4 and 68% in
Tromsø 6. To ensure non-overlapping birth cohorts and attendance in
grip strength testing, our study population is comprised of two birth
cohorts; a) those born during 1923–1935 participating in the Tromsø
study wave 4 in 1994–1995 at ages 59–71 years (N = 3576), and b)
those born during 1936–1948 participating in the Tromsø study wave 6
in 2007–2008 at ages 59–71 years (N = 1793). Marital status and grip
strength for cohort a) was based on data from the Tromsø 4 study and
for cohort b) it was based on Tromsø 6 data. Both were assessed for the
same age range (59–71 years).
Marital status was self-reported in both Tromsø study waves 4 and 6
using the same question. The four marital states in the study are mar-
ried, widowed, divorced/separated, and never married - data on in-
dividual marital status is collected from the national population reg-
istry. We do not use cohabitation as a separate category, as for the
period we consider there is a lack of cohabitation data from the national
population registry. Moreover, there are often difficulties in producing
comparable assessments on cohabitation (Murphy, 2006). In Tromsø 4
there was a separate question on whether one lives with a partner, but for
the noted problems we do not focus on the cohabitees in this study.
Grip strength was measured similarly in Tromsø 4 and 6 following
the same protocol. For the non-dominant hand, it was measured using a
Martin Vigorimeter (Sipers, Verdijk, Sipers, Schols, & van Loon, 2016).
The Martin Vigorimeter is a device to measure handgrip strength when
respondents press a rubber balloon connected to a manometer, which
expresses the results in bar. The Martin Vigorimeter comes with three
balloon sizes and we used the large sized balloon for men and medium
sized for women, as instructed in the manual (KLS Martin Group, 2012).
Each participant was allowed two attempts, and the highest score re-
gistered was recorded and used in analyses. Grip strength was roughly
normally distributed and treated as a continuous variable in analyses.
Although strength tends to decline over the adult life cycle, ob-
served grip strength at later ages is predictive of the rank-ordering of
grip strength earlier in life (when the majority of the marriages
formed). Early adult grip strength has been found to have a high cor-
relation to one’s strength later in life, as evidenced by a 27 year follow-
up in the US (Rantanen et al. 1998). Similar studies from other samples
support a relatively high degree of stability over the life course in terms
of the rank-ordering of grip strength (Hughes et al., 2001).
Hypothesis
The research discussed has suggested that women may have more
partner selection criteria to be fulfilled than men, and that while male
preferences relate to beauty and a pleasant personality, female pre-
ferences include provider potential and strength. In this study, we use
cohort-by-gender comparisons to examine the association between
health and marital status, using grip strength as our proxy measure of
global health. If men are chosen as husbands, in part, on the basis of
being robust and healthy, then grip strength among married men
should be superior to that of unmarried men. Since men use other (and
perhaps fewer) criteria to choose wives, we should find no association
between grip strength and marital status among women. Finally, if
women are becoming more selective, then we would expect a stronger
relationship among more recently born cohort than older cohorts.
The association between grip strength and family status and other
covariates was analyzed using ordinary least squares regression, with
grip strength as the outcome variable. Analyses were adjusted by age as
a continuous variable. In addition, we calculated direct age adjusted
mean grip strength values, by grouping age in three categories (59–63,
64–67, 68–71 years) with equal weight for each age category.
We adjust for age, and we control for marital status and gender as
well as cohort. Our regression also takes into account possible con-
founding by daily smoking, self-reported general health, self-reported
heart disease, systolic blood pressure and leisure physical activity.
These factors were selected because they have previously been found to
be associated both with marital status and grip strength (see literature
discussion).
We do not hypothesize that men have a changing preference for
women’s grip strength. Our key hypothesis is that marriage shows a
stronger association with physical strength among more recent cohorts
of Norwegian men. We formulate the following hypotheses:
H1. Being never married and having low grip strength will both lead to
greater mortality.
H2. The effect of grip strength on mortality will be stronger among the
never married than among the married in more recent cohorts.
Results
Table 1 reports the descriptive evidence for the cohorts born 1923-
35 and 1936-48 respectively, and reveals that marital status differs
between successive cohorts. Among the men in the earliest birth cohort
(n = 1691) most were married (77%), while 9% were divorced/sepa-
rated. In the most recent male birth cohort, the share of married was
similar (76%) to the earliest cohort, and the share of divorced/sepa-
rated was higher (13%). A similar pattern was seen for women. A rising

 share of divorced occurred in the later born cohort (up from 10% to
15%), while the proportion married was relatively stable (rising from
61% to 63%). The share that were widowed fell strongly for the women
from 25% to 17%, but only from 6% to 4% among the men.
Table 2 reveals that never married men had significantly lower grip
strength compared with married men (p < 0.01 for both cohorts). This
difference was particularly pronounced in the youngest birth cohort
(born 1936–48). The interaction term for being never married by birth
cohort was significant both in the age-adjusted model 1 (p = 0.015),
and in the fully adjusted model 2 (p = 0.020). In the earlier born birth
cohort, the difference was only 0.05 bar (p = 0.004) in the age adjusted
model 1, (or the equivalent of 3.4 years), and 0.03 bar (p = 0.08) in the
fully adjusted model 2. In the later born cohort, in the age-adjusted
model 1, never married men had 0.13 bar lower grip strength than
married men (p < 0.001), which corresponded to an age difference of
10.8 years given normal age-related decline. Further adjustments
(model 2) did not attenuate much this difference between married and
never married men (0.12 bar difference, p < 0.001). The other groups
(divorced/separated, widowed) did not differ significantly in grip
strength from the married men in either of the two cohorts. For women
there were no significant differences in grip strength between the
marital groups in either of the two cohorts. The difference in grip
strength between marital groups is visualized in Fig. 1. This implies that
low grip strength among those born in later periods is increasingly re-
lated to being never married for the later born cohort of men. No re-
lationship is found for women.
Table 3 shows the relationship between marriage, grip strength and
mortality. Possible confounders that were taken into account were the
following covariates: body mass index (BMI), current smoking self-re-
ported health, a history of heart disease, education, systolic blood
pressure and physical activity. We did a complete case analysis (non-
missing values for all covariates). There was N = 5009 participants of
whom 649 died during follow-up (out of N = 5367 individuals of
whom 693 died in the full sample).
Mortality was lower for the later born versus the earlier born cohort;
their HR was 0.45 (95% CI 0.37, 0.56). Grip strength was found to be
inversely associated with mortality in both men and women; one SD
stronger grip was associated with HR = 0.77 (0.71, 0.84) for both
genders.
Compared to the reference category who are married, those who are
divorced were at significantly increased death risk; HR = 1.40 (p =
0.01). Also never married had significantly increased HR = 1.40 (p =
0.02). Widows/widower were not at significantly increased risks of
mortality.
There

interactions (p = 0.91) or birth cohort by marital status interaction (p

Adjustment for grip strength did not substantially attenuate the
association between family situation and mortality (the divorced HR
shrunk from 1.40 in the minimally adjusted model to 1.36 in the grip-
adjusted model, still being significant (p = 0.01). Corresponding HRs
for never married were 1.40 (p = 0.02) and 1.33 (p = 0.056). Further
adjustment for the aforementioned covariates attenuated some of the
association between family situation and mortality (for divorced HR
changed from 1.40 in the minimally adjusted model to 1.18 in the fully
adjusted model, and the association was no longer significant (p =
0.19)). Corresponding HRs for never married were similar to those for
divorced.
In sum our results lend support to H1; there is an increasing share
among men who are both never married and have low grip strength.
Yet, H2 is rejected: there is no significant interaction effects from low
grip strength and marital status on mortality.
Discussion and limitations
Ongoing demographic change in terms of changes in family forms
combined with population ageing has lead to an increase in the share of
non-married households as well as rising numbers of suffering from
sarcopenia (Chaves, Camozzato, Eizirik, & Kaye, 2009; Cullum et al.,
2000). The fact that both low grip strength and lack of a partner can
relate to mortality and that these two dimensions are increasingly oc-
curring jointly (among males) can be important for developing an un-
derstanding of effective policies. Having a spouse could help one
compensate for low physical strength: A couple can divide tasks (or
jointly conduct activities), thereby offsetting or reducing limitations
caused by lower functional capacities. Being married could help in-
dividuals lead healthier lifestyles and decrease negative health effects
stemming from low physical strength.
In terms of mortality, the divorced were at significantly 40% in-
creased mortality risk over a 9-year period compared with married, and
this held true both for genders and both birth cohorts. This association
was robust to adjustment for grip strength, but no longer significant
after adjustment for health related variables. Similar associations were
observed for the never married.
Family constellations (such as marital and cohabitation status,
number
of
children/childlessness,

household type) can affect health through, for instance, its effects on
lifestyles, influencing nutrition and activity levels and sanctioning risky
behavior. For instance, people are likely to end tobacco smoking when

 they marry (Graham, 2012; McDermott, Dobson, & Owen, 2006).
Spousal support could also be a way of mitigating stress, improving
finances, practical support and giving a sense of belonging, meaning
and purpose in life (Becker, 1991; Roy, Schumm, & Britt, 2014;
Thomeer, Umberson, & Pudrovska, 2013).
The current study identified that physical strength as an indicator of
general health is increasingly related to marital outcomes across birth
cohorts. We are not aware of any earlier research looking at cohort
variation in determinants of marital outcomes as well as grip strength.
Our main goal was not to focus on the direction of causality but rather
to reveal that the relationship between grip strength, marital status and
health as it has emerged in recent decades is changing. A limitation of
this study is that our longitudinal individual analyses follow individuals
from ages 59 and older - we do not know how grip strength developed

Interaction terms grip strength by marital status were not significant, neither in men nor women (men: p = 0.72, women:p = 0.64) and therefore not included in the
model.
Model 1: Bivariate analyses, one variable entered at the time (only adjusted by age)
Model 2: Grip strength, adjusted by birth cohort and gender (and age)
Model 3: Marital status, adjusted by birth cohort and gender (and age)
Model 4: All variables in models above added
Model 5: Model 4 + adjusted by BMI, daily smoking, self-reported general health, self-reported heart disease, educational level, systolic blood pressure, leisure
physical activity
Grip strength in bar measured by a Martin vigorimeter were standardized specifically in four groups by sex and birth cohort.

 earlier in life. Hence, low grip strength may have led to lower marriage
probabilities, or, alternatively, being married could potentially have
improved male physical strength. We further lack data on marital
quality, which is another dimension that could relate to health out-
comes, including mortality in our study.
Low grip strength among those who lack a partner can imply a
lower capacity to cope with everyday challenges and less healthy daily
routines, including nutrition and activities. The fact that many are
alone with low grip could imply that more attention needs to be given
to this group, particularly given their relatively poor health. Even in
high income welfare states such as Norway, the provision of care and
assistance to disabled older individuals often falls on their spouses
(Aronson & Neysmith, 1997; Soma & Yamashita, 2011) — and to wives
in particular (Costa‐Font, Karlsson, & Øien, 2016; Lee & Tang, 2013).
Reliance on this informal network of care assumes that older men who
require care in later life will have wives available to provide it. Mar-
riage, particularly when one partner is physically impaired or requires
assistance, can be central to the health of the couple.
As women tend to outlive men, albeit often in poorer health, the
gender dimension is important to understand health outcomes and
marriage (Liu & Waite, 2014; Miller, Hollist, Olsen, & Law, 2013).
Trends in gender specific health and marriage could therefore be im-
portant determinants of the sustainable of welfare states (Carone et al.,
2005; Langer et al., 2015). However, our results hint that women may
be favoring partners who signal strength and vigor when they marry. If
longer-lived women marry healthier men, then both may avoid or defer
the role of caregiver, while less healthy men remain unmarried and
must look elsewhere for assistance. Women’s economic dependence has
been reduced as women have become more educated, more skilled,
more experienced, and more inclined towards employment. Men’s
‘health dependence’ may require a different sort of education and ex-
perience as well as new housing alternatives that provide more col-
lective in lieu of spousal support.
Our findings increase the importance of identifying policies that
could help men with low strength to live independently and alone at
later ages – such policies could include housing arrangements that en-
courage social interaction, or voluntary roles that enables independent
living in spite of age-related decline. Potential policies can include
counselling of individuals who are not married and with low strength to
better prepare for old age and information on how to avoid negative
health consequences of independent living. New technologies may po-
tentially offset some of the limitations that low grip strength may imply.
Social policies could also consider increasingly target this group by
providing financial support for those who suffer a “double burden” of
being single and having poor grip strength.
