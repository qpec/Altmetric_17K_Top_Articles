A 1% change in average speed is enough to affect medal rankings in intense Olympic
endurance events lasting ∼45 s to 8 min which for example includes 100 m swimming
and 400 m running (∼1 min), 1,500 m running and 4000 m track cycling (∼4 min) and
2,000 m rowing (∼6-8 min). To maximize the likelihood of winning, athletes utilizes legal
supplements with or without scientifically documented beneficial effects on performance.
Therefore, a continued systematic evidence based evaluation of the possible ergogenic
effects is of high importance. A meta-analysis was conducted with a strict focus on
closed-end performance tests in humans in the time domain from 45 s to 8 min. These
test include time-trials or total work done in a given time. This selection criterion results in
a high relevance for athletic performance. Only peer-reviewed placebo controlled studies
were included. The often applied and potentially ergogenic supplements beta-alanine,
bicarbonate, caffeine and nitrate were selected for analysis. Following a systematic
search in Pubmed and SportsDiscuss combined with evaluation of cross references a
total of 7 (beta-alanine), 25 (bicarbonate), 9 (caffeine), and 5 (nitrate) studies was included
in the meta-analysis. For each study, performance was converted to an average speed
(km/h) from which an effect size (ES; Cohens d with 95% confidence intervals) was
calculated. A small effect and significant performance improvement relative to placebo
was observed for caffeine (ES: 0.41 [0.15–0.68], P = 0.002) and bicarbonate (ES: 0.40
[0.27–0.54], P < 0.001). Trivial and non-significant effects on performance was observed
for nitrate (ES: 0.19 [−0.03–0.40], P = 0.09) and beta-alanine (ES: 0.17 [−0.12–0.46],
P = 0.24). Thus, caffeine’s and bicarbonate’s ergogenic effect is clearly documented
for intense endurance performance. Importantly, for all supplements an individualized
approach may improve the ergogenic effect on performance.

Supplements for Intense Endurance Performance
INTRODUCTION
A 1% change in average speed is enough to affect medal
rankings in intense Olympic endurance events lasting ∼45 s
to 8 min (Table 1). To maximize the likelihood of winning,
athletes utilizes legal supplements with or without scientifically
documented effects on performance (Tsitsimpikou et al., 2009;
Tscholl et al., 2010; Solheim et al., 2016). Extensive narrative
reviews exist, but systematic critical evaluation of frequently
used supplements effects on human exercise performance are
lacking, but are required in order to advise elite-, subelite-
and age-group athletes for or against usage. Importantly, the
magnitude of possible performance enhancing effects related to
supplementation must be seen relative to the obtainable effects
of physical, technical and tactical training. When advising for
or against supplement usage it is important to realize that early
exposure to supplements may increase the likelihood of reverting
to illegal performance enhancing strategies (Dodge and Jaccard,
2006). Moreover, the risk of contamination or undeclared illegal
substances in products is noteworthy and can result in a positive
doping test (Geyer et al., 2004; Outram and Stewart, 2015).
Thus, it is important for athletes and staff to balance the
potential performance gain with the known risks associated with
supplementation.
In the context of detecting subtle differences in performance
the type of exercise testing is of outmost importance. To obtain
the highest elite-sport relevance (i.e., high ecologic validity),
“closed-end” performance tests with a fixed distance (e.g.,
2,000 m rowing) or duration (e.g., 6 min maximal rowing) should
be the first choice as these resembles competition. However,
“open-end” time to exhaustion trials is often applied. This type
of evaluation does not resemble athletic competition and likely
imposes a high mental stress for the athletes, as there is no set
goal. Importantly, closed-end performance tests demonstrate a
smaller day to day variance as compared to open-end evaluations
(Jeukendrup et al., 1996; Laursen et al., 2007).
The
majority
of
individual
Olympic
competitions
are
completed in a time span from ∼45 s to 8 min, including 400 m
running and 100 m swimming (∼1 min) as well as 4,000 m
cycling (∼4 min) and 2,000 m rowing (∼7 min) (Table 1).
Thus, the effect on performance from supplementation in this
time domain is of high interest. In previous narrative reviews,
beta-alanine and sodium-bicarbonate (termed bicarbonate in
the present review) (Stellingwerff et al., 2007) as well as
caffeine (Davis and Green, 2009) have been proposed to have
an ergogenic potential for such athletic events, and recently
nitrate supplementation has received growing attention as
a potential ergogenic supplement for athletes (Jones, 2014).
Consequently, the present systematic meta-analysis evaluates
if supplementation with beta-alanine, bicarbonate, caffeine or
nitrate can improve intense endurance exercise performance in
the time domain 45 s to 8 min when only including closed-end
performance tests of high ecological validity.
Currently, a general performance enhancing effect of beta-
alanine supplementation on intense exercise is suggested based
on mixed exercise protocols encompassing primarily time to
exhaustion testing (Artioli et al., 2010; Caruso et al., 2012;
Hobson et al., 2012; Quesnele et al., 2014; Trexler et al., 2015).
However, a meta-analysis from 2012 including 15 studies with
mixed exercise protocols demonstrated no significant effect of
supplementation on performance in general, but a separate
analysis of 9 mixed performance measures lasting between 60
and 240 s showed a significant effect (Hobson et al., 2012). A
later analysis demonstrated that the effect on open-end exercise
testing lasting 0.5–10 min was almost five times as high as on
performance relevant closed-end testing (Saunders et al., 2017).
Thus, there is a need to systematically evaluate the effect of
beta-alanine supplementation on exercise performance in trained
subjects completing performance relevant testing lasting from
45 s to 8 min.
A number of narrative reviews have addressed the potential
ergogenic effect of bicarbonate ingestion (e.g., Requena et al.,
2005; McNaughton et al., 2008; Burke, 2013) but meta-analytical
approaches have been limited to the effect on running based
on only four studies (Schubert and Astorino, 2013) or analyses
of different exercise modalities, such as repeated sprinting and
time to exhaustion tests (Carr et al., 2011a; Peart et al., 2012).
Specifically, a ∼2% increase in 1 min mean power sprinting
can be expected based on inference statistics but the effect was
not reported to be significant at the P < 0.05 level (Carr et al.,
2011a). Thus, despite conclusions of possible beneficial effects
of bicarbonate supplementation for performance the evidence
is not convincing and analyses focusing on distinct types of
performance tests and time domains are warranted.
Several comprehensive reviews dealing with the potential
ergogenic effects of caffeine exist and it is generally acknowledged
that ingestion of caffeine can enhance endurance performance
lasting 20–250 min (e.g., Graham, 2001; Doherty and Smith,
2004; Ganio et al., 2009; Spriet, 2014,) as well as brief more
intense exercise performance lasting 1–3 min (Davis and Green,
2009). However, apart from one review (Ganio et al., 2009) this
conclusion is based on a mix of exercise protocols including
fixed distance, fixed time or time to exhaustion tests. To the
best of our knowledge, only one study has applied a systematic
review and meta-analytical approach (Doherty and Smith, 2004)
and included various types of exercise tests, resulting in the
conclusion that caffeine is less ergogenic during intense short
term exercise than longer endurance exercise. Thus, there is a
need for a systematic review of caffeines possible ergogenic effects
on a single bout of intense exercise lasting 45 s to 8 min.
A recent area of considerable interest from researchers and
athletes is nitrate supplementation via beetroot juice or sodium
nitrate ingestion. Based on narrative reviews it has been suggested
that nitrate supplementation enhances performance (Clements
et al., 2014; Jones, 2014) and a meta-analytical approach revealed
that a significant effect exists for time to exhaustion tests whereas
the effect on time-trials was insignificant (Hoon et al., 2013).
Additionally, a current meta-analysis including a high variety
of exercise modalities resulted in an unclear effect (Braakhuis
and Hopkins, 2015). Thus, systematic analyses of specific time
domains and competition relevant testing are lacking.
The primary aim of the present systematic review is to add
to previous primarily narrative reviews by including recent
studies with beta-alanine, bicarbonate, caffeine, and nitrate

supplementation having a strict focus on closed-end performance
evaluation in the time domain 45 s to 8 min.
In turn, a secondary aim is to conduct a meta-analysis in
which the isolated effects on performance from beta-alanine,
bicarbonate, caffeine and nitrate supplementation is evaluated
with the same methods allowing for a better comparison of the
supplements ergogenic properties, since previous reviews mainly
have been centered around a single supplement with various
methods applied (e.g., mix of test protocols and large span in time
domain).
METHODS
Criteria for Study Selection
Two researchers independently identified eligible peer-reviewed
studies by a systematic search in the electronic database
Medline (PubMed). The search strategy included the following
medical subject heading (MeSH) terms: “humans,” “beta-
alanine,” “caffeine,” “nitrate,” and “bicarbonate.” MeSH terms
were combined with the following wild card strings “run∗,”
“ski∗,” “swim∗,” “row∗,” “kayak∗” as well as “cycling” and “intense
exercise.” A similar search strategy was applied in the database
SPORTDiscus. Additional relevant studies were identified from
cross-referencing. The search was terminated in April 2016.
Included studies utilized a single or double blind placebo
controlled cross-over design, except for studies of beta-alanine
where a single blinded parallel group design was allowed due to
the long washout period of 6–15 weeks for beta-alanine (Baguet
et al., 2009) and in this case data pre and post supplementation
were included in the meta-analysis. Only studies applying
performance test lasting from 45 s to 8 min with either a fixed
duration or fixed distance in able bodied healthy human subjects
were included. If several performance tests were conducted in
a single study, only the results of the first performance test was
included in case at least 20 min of recovery was applied between
tests in order to avoid effects related to pacing and fatigue.
Studies were included if they adhered to the present
consensus of optimal supplementation. For beta-alanine, the
supplementation period should be 28 days or longer with
ingestion of ≥3 g per day (Derave et al., 2010). Bicarbonate doses
of ≥0.2 g/kg bodyweight ingested >60 min before performance
testing as well as multi-day bicarbonate intake of ≥0.3 g/kg daily

Supplements for Intense Endurance Performance
(McNaughton, 1992a; Siegler et al., 2010, 2012; Carr et al., 2011a)
or pre-exercise infusion (Kindermann et al., 1977) was accepted.
Caffeine supplementation of ≥2 mg/kg bodyweight supplied 30
min or longer before the performance test (Graham and Spriet,
1995; Pasman et al., 1995; Spriet, 2014) was included. Finally,
acute nitrate ingestion of ≥4 mmol, 120–300 min before the
performance test (Vanhatalo et al., 2010b; Wylie et al., 2013) or
chronic exposure was accepted.
For inclusion in the meta-analysis, performance results were
required to be reported as an absolute group mean with a
standard deviation or standard error of the mean, both before
and after the intervention. In studies in which the standard
error were reported, they were converted to standard deviations
by multiplying the standard error by the square root of the
sample size. Moreover, studies were required to report speed
or an entity that was convertible to speed by standard methods
(e.g., conversion to speed from time to cover a given distance
in field tests or ergometer tests). In one study with rowing as
exercise modality only mean power was reported for the 2,000-
m distance covered (Carr et al., 2012). This was converted to an
average speed from the formula provided by the manufacture of
the Concept II rowing ergometer used in that study:
Time pr. 500 m = 3√/(2.8/Power (watt))
In studies reporting mean power or total work from ergometer
cycling (McNaughton, 1992a,b; McNaughton et al., 1997; Marx
et al., 2002; Doherty et al., 2004; Vanhatalo et al., 2010a; Driller
et al., 2012; Howe et al., 2013; Hoon et al., 2014a; Thomas et al.,
2016) an average speed (v; m/s) was determined numerically
using the formula (Martin et al., 1998):
Power (watt) =
��
0, 5CdA × Rho∗v2�
+
�
total weight∗ Crr∗ g
��∗ v
�
1 − drivetrain loss%/ 100
�
In the above calculation it is assumed that no windspeed or slope
(gradient) is affecting the rider with the use of fixed values for
CdA (drag coefficient × frontal area) = 0.321; Rho (air density) =
1.226 kg/m3, total weight (rider and bicycle; kg) using a fixed bike
weight of 8 kg and the average body weight listed in each study,
Crr (Coefficient of rolling resistance) = 0.005, g (gravitational
force constant) = 9.8067 m/s2, drivetrain loss% = 3%.
Accordingly,
for
all
studies
average
speed
and
the
corresponding standard deviation were calculated for each
supplement and the placebo (bicarbonate, caffeine, nitrate) or
pre supplementation (beta-alanine) condition.
Based on these criteria a total of 7, 25, 9, and 5 studies of
beta-alanine, bicarbonate, caffeine and nitrate, respectively, were
included (Figure 1). Some of the included studies applied several
performance tests.
Study Quality
Based on present guidelines from the Cochrane Institute (Higgins
et al., 2011), study quality was assessed with the terms “high risk”
or “low risk” of bias modified for exercise performance analyses
(Table 2). The relative distribution of studies within each of the
four supplements having high or low risk of bias are shown in
Figure 2.
Data Analysis
Effect sizes (Cohens d) including a Hedges bias correction factor
are displayed in forest plots based on standardized differences
(SMD) calculated as
SMD = (Xs − Xc)
Sp
(1)
where Xs was average speed with supplementation, Xc was
average speed in the control situation (i.e., Placebo trials
for bicarbonate, caffeine and nitrate and pre beta-alanine
supplementation), and Sp is the pooled standard deviation
determined as
Sp = Squareroot((SDs2 × (n − 1) ± SDc2× (n − 1))
(n + n − 2)
(2)
where SDs is standard deviation with supplementation, SDc is
standard deviation in the control situation and n is the number
of subjects.
A multivariate meta-analysis was used to appropriate handle
multiple and partly non-overlapping treatments between studies
(van Houwelingen et al., 2002). Specifically, a mixed effects
model was fitted to logarithm-transformed group means using
maximum likelihood estimation; standard errors of logarithm-
transformed means were used as weights. The five treatment
groups were included as fixed effects in the model. The
dependence between multiple means from the same studies
was captured through the inclusion of study-specific random
effects. Combined effects were estimated and the resulting
differences between the four active treatments (supplementation)
and control situation were reported (after back-transformation).
A significance level of 0.05 was applied. Effect sizes was
characterized as either trivial (0–0.2), small (0.2–0.6) or large
(>0.6) (Hopkins et al., 2009). Analyses were carried out using the
statistical environment R (R Core Team, 2016) with the extension
package “metafor” (Viechtbauer, 2010).
RESULTS
Beta-Alanine
A total of 7 studies were identified including 72 subjects. VO2-
max as an objective measure of training status was reported in
two of the studies (Howe et al., 2013; Bellinger and Minahan,
2016). The proportion of female subjects could not be precisely
determined due to incomplete reporting of groups in one
study (Painelli Vde et al., 2013) but amounted to ∼8%. Two
studies included several interventions with different performance
tests (Painelli Vde et al., 2013; Bellinger and Minahan, 2016).
Thus, 11 performance tests were included in the meta-analysis
(Figure 3). The estimated combined effect size (with 95%
confidence interval) for β-alanine supplementation was 0.17
[−0.12−0.46] which was not significantly different from the
pre-supplementation trial (P = 0.24).

Bicarbonate
A total of 25 studies were identified including 235 subjects. VO2-
max was reported in six of the studies (McNaughton, 1992a,b;
McNaughton et al., 1997; Vanhatalo et al., 2010a; Driller et al.,
2012; Thomas et al., 2016) and the female subject proportion was
∼9%. Six studies included several interventions with different
administration of bicarbonate (McNaughton, 1992a; Carr et al.,
2012; Driller et al., 2012; Joyce et al., 2012) or evaluation of
performance using several tests (McNaughton, 1992b; Painelli
Vde et al., 2013). Thus, 33 performance tests were included
in the meta-analysis (Figure 4). The estimated combined effect
size of 0.40 [0.27–0.54] demonstrates a faster exercise speed
after bicarbonate supplementation compared to placebo (P <
0.001).
Caffeine
A total of 9 studies were identified including 97 subjects.
VO2-max was reported in three of the studies (Wiles et al.,
1992; Skinner et al., 2010; Santos Rde et al., 2013). Assuming
only male subjects in protocol “2” by Wiles et al. (1992),
the female subject proportion was 3%. One study included
several interventions with different administration of caffeine
(Skinner et al., 2010) and one evaluated performance using
several tests (Wiles et al., 1992). Thus, 12 performance tests
were included in the meta-analysis (Figure 5). The estimated
combined effect size of 0.41 [0.15–0.68] demonstrates a faster
exercise speed after ingesting of caffeine compared to placebo
(P = 0.002).
Nitrate
A total of 5 studies were identified including 66 subjects. VO2-
max was reported in three of the studies and 8% of subjects
were females. Three studies included several interventions with
different administration of nitrate (Boorsma et al., 2014; Hoon
et al., 2014a,b) and one study both manipulated administration
and exercise testing (Peeling et al., 2015). Thus, 8 performance
tests were included in the meta-analysis (Figure 6). The

0.17, P < 0.001) implying slightly greater performance gains
with reductions in performance test time (Figure 7). A similar
observation was found for bicarbonate (r2 = 0.19, P < 0.05) and
caffeine (r2 = 0.45, P < 0.05), while no association were seen for
beta-alanine (r2 = 0.07) and nitrate (r2 = 0.0001).
DISCUSSION
The primary finding in the present meta-analysis is that a
small yet significant effect on performance was observed by
prior supplementation with caffeine (Effect size, ES = 0.41) or
bicarbonate (ES = 0.40) resulting in a higher average speed
during closed-end intense endurance exercise tests lasting 45 s
to 8 min. No significant performance effect was detectable
for supplementation with beta-alanine or nitrate, with both
supplements having a trivial effect (ES = 0.17–0.19) (Figure 8).
Beta-Alanine
Based on the 11 performance tests from the 7 included studies
with a total of 72 subjects the present analysis demonstrates
that beta-alanine supplementation cannot be concluded to be
ergogenic in competitive intense endurance sports (Figures 3, 8).
This is in contrast to the position stand of the international
society of sports nutrition where it is stated that beta-alanine
supplementation generally enhances intense exercise lasting
more than 60 s (Trexler et al., 2015). In this context, it is
important to note that this was primarily found for open-end
exercise tests and not the competition relevant time trial test. In
line with the conclusion from the present analysis, Hobson et al.
(2012) also reported no significant performance effect of beta-
alanine supplementation despite improved time to exhaustion
based on mixed exercise protocols and Saunders et al. (2017)
found that the effect of beta-alanine was ∼5 times as high in
open-end tests as in performance relevant closed-end tests.
Due to the long supplementation period (∼1 month) a
concern with all beta-alanine studies is to discriminate between
effects from the supplementation per se and time effects (e.g.,
higher or lower training status during the supplementation
period). The use of a placebo group or a cross-over design is
required to discriminate between effects of supplementation per
see or time-effects. Accordingly, in one of the included studies,
Derave et al. (2007) reported similar improvement in the placebo
and beta-alanine group implying that the changes in performance
in the former group could be attributed to other factors than the
supplement.
It is unclear how beta-alanine supplementation should
improve human exercise performance but the most often
suggested possibilities are a higher muscle carnosine content
which may increase intramuscular buffer capacity (Parkhouse
et al., 1985), increase calcium sensitivity and/or increase
calcium release (Dutka et al., 2012) or improve anti-oxidant
capacity (Kohen et al., 1988; Pavlov et al., 1993). The
paresthethic effect of beta alanine occurring in 0% (Derave
et al., 2007; Hobson et al., 2013), ∼15% (Bellinger and
Minahan, 2016), ∼25% (Howe et al., 2013), or ∼50 %
of participants (Painelli Vde et al., 2013) in the included
studies can be speculated to cause a placebo-effect. Still,
performance gains around 1% as observed in many of the
individual studies (Figures 3, 7) is considered relevant to explore
for high performance intense endurance athletes (Table 1)
irrespective of the mechanism(s). At present larger studies
of elite athletes are required and/or studies of individual
responses that can be reproduced which in turn may be
affected by factors such as gender, diet and muscle fiber type
distribution (Derave et al., 2010). Taken together, the present
meta-analysis underlines that no clear ergogenic effect of beta-
alanine supplementation can be expected in competitions lasting
from 45 s to 8 min.
Bicarbonate
Bicarbonate
supplementation
significantly
improved
performance. The analysis was based on a total of 33 performance
tests from 25 studies with a total of 235 subjects (Figures 4, 8).
The present finding is in agreement with the recommendation of
using bicarbonate as an ergogenic compound when competing
in events lasting 1–10 min (Carr et al., 2011a). Contrary to the
comprehensive analysis of Carr et al. (2011a) we only included
performance relevant tests by excluding open-end test protocols,
which is considered of great practical importance for athletes
since time to exhaustion testing may introduce larger variability
because of motivational and mental aspects (Jeukendrup et al.,
1996; Laursen et al., 2007).

with beta-alanine, bicarbonate, caffeine and nitrate. Bars denote the relative distribution of studies for each supplements with a high or low risk of bias. See
Methods for details regarding criteria for high and low risk.
It is important to note that exclusion of just one performance
test (of a total of 33 tests with 235 subjects)—originating from
the study of 5 rowers by McNaughton and Cedaro (1991)
having a substantial high effect size (Figure 4)–causes a marked
change of both the p-value (from below 0.001 to 0.06) and the
combined effect size (from 0.40 to 0.19). Accordingly, a balanced
interpretation of the data included in the analysis is warranted.
Nevertheless, the potential for bicarbonate to improve intense
endurance performance seems apparent albeit small, both with
(small combined effect size being highly significant different from
placebo) or without (combined effect size trivial close to small
tending to be different from placebo) inclusion of that particular
study.
As
with
beta-alanine
supplementation,
bicarbonate’s
mechanism of action is not fully established but possibly
includes increased blood and/or muscle buffer capacity leading
to improved protection of muscular contractility via reduced
intra- and extracellular H+ accumulation (Raymer et al., 2004),
potentially affecting calcium sensitivity (Nelson and Fitts, 2014),
improved potassium handling (Street et al., 2005), diminished
arterial desaturation (Nielsen et al., 2002) or reduced type
III/IV afferent firing (Amann et al., 2015). In turn, reductions
in blood pH and bicarbonate prior to exercise is known to
impair subsequent rowing performance following ammonium
chloride ingestion (Brien and McKenzie, 1989) and one legged
knee extensor exercise capacity following prior intense arm

exercise (Bangsbo et al., 1996; Nordsborg et al., 2003). Thus,
the typical increase in blood pH of ∼0.1 and bicarbonate
concentration of ∼5 mM with supplementation (Carr et al.,
2011a) may be sufficient to postpone fatigue mechanisms during
intense endurance exercise. Based on simple regression analysis,
bicarbonate may be more ergogenic in shorter (e.g., 1 min) than
longer (e.g., 6 min) performance tests (Figure 7). Nevertheless,
the weak association illustrates that more studies are needed, for
example including several performance tests of varying duration
(e.g., 1, 4, and 8 min) executed by the same subjects. It should be
noted that marked individual differences may exist. For example,
bicarbonate supplementation caused gastro intestinal problems
in 4 out of 21 subjects prior to a time to exhaustion test and
exclusion of these four participants resulted in a significant
increased exercise time during intense cycling exercise (Saunders
et al., 2014). Additionally, there appear to be marked individual
differences in bicarbonate uptake kinetics (Jones et al., 2016) and
high level athletes may benefit from an individualized protocol
(Miller et al., 2016) but this also needs to be addressed in future
studies.
Caffeine
Average speed in intense endurance performance tests lasting
45 s to 8 min is increased by caffeine supplementation. The
finding is based on 12 different performance tests from 9
studies with a total of 97 subjects (Figures 5, 8). In half of
the studies the improvement in speed exceeded 1% relative to
placebo. This observation is in line with a previous narrative
review highlighting caffeine as an ergogenic compound for
speed endurance events lasting 1–3 min (Davis and Green,
2009) as well as reviews that focus on longer duration exercise
lasting several hours (Doherty and Smith, 2004; Ganio et al.,
2009). Thus, the present meta-analysis adds to the existing
knowledge by establishing that caffeine is also ergogenic in
the time domain from 45 s up to 8 min. The present result is
in apparent contradiction with the notion that caffeine is less
ergogenic in short relative to long-term exercise tests (Doherty
and Smith, 2004). However, the previous meta-analysis included
both open and closed end exercise testing and different time
intervals. Therefore, the discrepancy may be related to the
strict selection criteria in the present study, yet both studies
outline the ergogenic potential from caffeine in multiple types
of exercise tasks. The present meta-analysis does not allow
for an evaluation of the interaction between exercise time and
caffeine’s effect. However, a simple regression analysis based
on the non-weighed average effect of the included studies
suggests that a larger ergogenic effect may be expected during
shorter as compared to longer intense exercise within the time
domain of 45 s to 8 min (Figure 7). However, more systematic
studies on the possible interaction between exercise duration
and magnitude of effect are required before conclusions can be
drawn.
Several possibilities exist regarding caffeine’s ergogenic effect.
These include antagonizing binding of adenosine to its brain
receptors which may cause reduced perception of effort and
increased arousal and/or peripheral inhibition of muscle pain
(Davis and Green, 2009). In support of this notion, participants
following caffeine intake report lower perceived exertion during
exercise with the same absolute exercise intensity (Doherty
et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2014) and in 5 min intervals a similar
level of perceived exertion despite a higher mean power with
caffeine (Lane et al., 2013). In line herewith, the same degree
of exertion has been reported between placebo and caffeine
trials during intense endurance performance tests despite
improved performance in the latter condition (Santos Rde
et al., 2013; Christensen et al., 2014). However, the performance
enhancing effect of caffeine may also be related to improved
muscle contractility caused by reduced K+
accumulation
during intense exercise (Mohr et al., 2011) or even by the
augmented adrenergic response to caffeine supplementation

FIGURE 4 | Standardized mean difference (effect size) with 95% confidence intervals as reported in studies of bicarbonate supplementations impact

described in methods section. All other data is reported as mean ± SD. All performance tests were executed indoors on ergometers or treadmills unless stated

a 30 min period to consume capsules followed by additional 60 min before start of test and “240 & 120 min” denotes intake of capsules 240 and 120 min before start
of test. For studies with chronic loading the amount of days (d) is listed as well as timing of last dose before performance test. #Speed estimated from mean power

associated with a larger glycolytic energy turnover during intense
endurance exercise (Jackman et al., 1996) although this has
been challenged as the main mechanism for the ergogenic
effect (Davis and Green, 2009). The exact mechanism of action
in specific exercise situations may differ and remains to be
elucidated. Caffeine doses in the included studies ranged
from 2 to 6 mg/kg body weight, which is in accordance
with
previous
guidelines
(Spriet,
2014).
Taken
together,
caffeine appears to improve exercise performance lasting
45 s to 8 min.
Nitrate
Nitrate supplementation did not significantly improve average
speed in the 8 performance tests extracted from the 5
included studies with a total of 66 subjects (Figures 6, 8).
Accordingly, previous meta-analyses have reported unclear
effects in performance tests with a large range in exercise time
(Hoon et al., 2013) or with a mix of protocols (Braakhuis
and Hopkins, 2015). However, a tendency (P = 0.09) for an
effect was identified, underpinning the importance of future
well-controlled studies designed to identify small effects (i.e.,
<1% on average speed) and/or repeatable individual responses.
It is noteworthy that nitrate supplementation does not appear
to exert any physiologic or endurance performance enhancing
effects on group level in highly trained endurance athletes
with an average VO2-max exceeding 70 ml/min/kg (Peacock
et al., 2012; Christensen et al., 2013; Boorsma et al., 2014;
Porcelli et al., 2015). Moreover, in a cross sectional study
encompassing VO2-max values between 28 and 81 ml/min/kg,
VO2-max explained more than 75% of the magnitude of
improvement in performance during a 3 km run (Porcelli et al.,
2015). In line herewith, the largest percentage performance

effect with nitrate supplementation in the present analysis
is observed in the recreational active cyclists undertaking a
4,000-m time trial (Lansley et al., 2011). Interestingly, highly
trained kayakers competing at international level experienced
improved performance after nitrate supplementation (Peeling
et al., 2015) implying that training status probably is not the sole
determinant of nitrates ergogenic potential. Important factors
may include high or low dietary nitrate intake from vegetable
consumption (Jonvik et al., 2016), initial plasma levels of nitrite
(Christensen et al., 2017) and muscle fiber composition in the
engaged muscles since rat studies demonstrate a larger effect
on blood perfusion after nitrate supplementation in muscles
with a large proportion of fast twitch fibers (Ferguson et al.,
2013).
Nitrate (NO−
3 ) supplementation increases bioavailability of
nitrite (NO−
2 ) and has been found to lower energy expenditure
during exercise and lower resting blood pressure (Larsen et al.,
2007), likely due to higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) affecting
muscle mitochondria and the circulation (Jones, 2014). The
trained human is characterized by a high endogenous capacity
for NO production (McConell et al., 2007; Nyberg et al., 2012)
which likely is a large contributing factor as to why nitrate
supplementation exerts modest physiologic effects in highly
trained individuals (Peacock et al., 2012; Christensen et al.,
2013; Boorsma et al., 2014; Porcelli et al., 2015). Still reports
exist of “responders” in groups of trained (Wilkerson et al.,
2012) and highly trained endurance athletes (Christensen et al.,
2013; Boorsma et al., 2014) in endurance events besides the
report on world class kayakers by Peeling et al. (2015). Thus,
future well-designed investigations of possible individual effects
of nitrate supplementation are required. At present nitrate
supplementation does not appear to have a clear ergogenic
effect on intense endurance performance, and the possibility
to achieve an ergogenic effect seems greater for moderately
trained subjects compared with highly trained endurance
athletes.
Methodologic Considerations
It is of importance to consider that a publication bias may exist
in the field of ergogenic supplements as it may be easier to
publish studies demonstrating performance enhancing effects
as compared to studies with no effect that are often under
powered to exclude that an effect may exist. We terminated
our study search in April 2016 but the field of ergogenic
supplements continues to evolve. Recently, studies has been
published showing no effect on intense endurance performance
from both bicarbonate (Callahan et al., 2016) and nitrate
(Callahan et al., 2016) supplementation whereas caffeine has
resulted in both unchanged (Cordingley et al., 2016) and
improved performance (Boyett et al., 2016). A number of the
included studies in the current meta-analysis also reported
negative findings, so to what extent an actual publication bias
toward positive results exits remains unknown. Nevertheless,
reporting of negative results are encouraged in order to provide
a balanced and hence accurate foundation for future meta-
analyses.
Importantly, the current quality assessment of the included
studies displayed a low risk of bias, apart from reporting drop-
outs and environmental factors and to a lesser extent time of
day for testing and activity the day prior testing (Figure 2) which
future studies are encouraged to report.
Other important considerations are the potential impact of
age, training status and gender for the observed effects of various
supplements on performance. The range in average age among
all of the included studies investigated was 19–33 years which
provides high ecologic validity for athletes competing at the
highest international level (e.g., Olympics). Still, further studies
are required to clarify if other effects can be observed in athletes

aged for example 30–40 years or even older. Regarding training
status, only ∼30% of the studies reported maximal oxygen
uptake as an objective index of cardio-respiratory capacity and
little information was provided about training history. Thus,
albeit relevant as highlighted for the nitrate studies, the few
studies reporting objective measures of training status preludes
an analysis of the general impact of training status. Several
studies report their participants to be “trained,” “well-trained,” or
“elite” but the used criteria is unclear. An additional challenge in
comparing training status, for example based on reported power
outputs, is that different methods of obtaining power is known to
yield different results. In cycling for instance, differences of 10 W
or more at ∼400 W is not uncommon (Duc et al., 2007; Kirkland
et al., 2008). Nevertheless, an impression of performance level
can be obtained by comparing the individual studies performance
speed (Figures 3–6) with the velocities of top competitors at the
Olympics provided in Table 1. Finally, it is evident that most
studies in the present meta-analysis have been conducted with
male subjects (Figures 3–6) as the proportion of female subjects
did not exceed 10% for any of the four supplements. Thus, it is
of relevance to investigate female subjects to a greater extent in
future studies. Included studies dominated by females observe
both large (McNaughton et al., 1997) and minor (Tiryaki and
Atterbom, 1995) effects following bicarbonate intake while large
effects also are seen after nitrate supplementation (Peeling et al.,
2015).
Perspectives
In the present meta-analysis, a trivial effect on intense endurance
performance was found for beta-alanine (ES = 0.17) and nitrate
(ES = 0.19) while small and significant ergogenic effects was
found for caffeine (ES = 0.41) and bicarbonate (ES = 0.40).
This does highlight that only marginal gains can be expected
from supplementation with the four substances (Figure 8). In
turn, it is important to note that youth athletes (Eisenmann
et al., 2001; Tønnessen et al., 2015) and mature sub-elite athletes
(e.g., Esfarjani and Laursen, 2007; Young et al., 2014) in regards

to endurance performance can benefit more from physiologic
training and maturation rather than supplementation.
Still, supplementation is considered highly relevant for high
performance athletes for whom very small margins separate
medal rankings during competition (Table 1). Based on the
results from the meta-analysis, caffeine and bicarbonate are
considered the primary supplements for intense endurance
athletes but even a trivial effect from beta-alanine and nitrate may
provide an advantage during competition. Accordingly, athletes
are encouraged to an individual approach in order to obtain

knowledge regarding what supplement(s) has the greatest effect
on performance.
Relatively few of the included studies in the present analysis
combined use of several supplements with combinations present
for caffeine and bicarbonate (Pruscino et al., 2008; Carr et al.,
2011b; Kilding et al., 2012; Christensen et al., 2014) and beta-
alanine and bicarbonate (Hobson et al., 2013; Painelli Vde
et al., 2013). This could be the scope for future studies and
help highlight if physiologic interactions between supplements
exists and also holds practical importance for high level athletes
and staff. Results are mixed for combined administration
of caffeine and bicarbonate. Accordingly, using a traditional
statistical approach (significance P < 0.05) both supplements
improved 4000 m cycling performance relatively to placebo but
the combination of both did not lead to a greater performance
than with single supplementation (Kilding et al., 2012). In
rowing caffeine both with and without bicarbonate improved
performance (Christensen et al., 2014), unlike observations
using magnitude-based inferences statistics where bicarbonate
abolished the improvement in performance with caffeine
alone (Carr et al., 2011b). Adding bicarbonate to beta-alanine
supplementation has been reported to improve 2,000 m rowing
(Hobson et al., 2013) as well as 100 and 200 m swimming
performance (Painelli Vde et al., 2013) with magnitude-based
inference statistics, but not with traditional statistics (Painelli
Vde et al., 2013). In a recent meta-analysis including a mix
of exercise protocols beta-alanine together with bicarbonate
induced a significant effect relative to use of beta-alanine alone
(Saunders et al., 2017). Clearly more studies are needed to
establish if positive or negative interactions between supplements
are present.
Legal supplements other than the four analyzed in the present
meta-analysis exist that may also impact on intense endurance
performance. Creatine has been investigated in a few studies with
reports of both unchanged (Burke et al., 1996; Mujika et al.,
1996; Syrotuik et al., 2001; De Andrade Nemezio et al., 2015)
and improved performance (Rossiter et al., 1996; McNaughton
et al., 1998). Importantly the majority of these studies reported
mean power from ergometers (Rossiter et al., 1996; McNaughton
et al., 1998; Syrotuik et al., 2001; De Andrade Nemezio et al.,
2015) but for athletes in which body mass often is a concern
it is important to account for any increase in weight which is
common with creatine supplementation (Mujika et al., 1996;
McNaughton et al., 1998; De Andrade Nemezio et al., 2015).
Accordingly, an increased body weight will increase resistive
forces on an athlete during forward propulsion leading to a
higher energy expenditure for a given speed especially during
running (LeCheminant et al., 2009) and in the water (Mujika
et al., 1996).
Another supplement is the antioxidant n-acetyl cysteine
(NAC) which following oral intake did not alter a 2–5 min time-
trial performance in one study (Slattery et al., 2014) but enhanced
exercise capacity in time to exhaustion tests lasting ∼8 min in
another study (Corn and Barstow, 2011) but more studies are
needed to establish if oral intake of NAC may be performance
enhancing.
In light of the central actions that caffeine exerts during
exercise lowering perception of effort (Doherty et al., 2004; Lane
et al., 2013; Santos Rde et al., 2013; Christensen et al., 2014;
Miller et al., 2014) the use of analgesic substances not banned
at present may also exert an ergogenic effect. This is partly
supported by improved time-trial performance (lasting ∼26 min)
and similar perception of effort as with placebo in trained cyclists
after intake of 1,500 mg acetaminophen (Mauger et al., 2010)
which is a mild over-the-counter analgesic in most countries.
In cycling, the presence of the morphine like drug Tramadol
in ∼5% of all samples analyzed in 2015 by the World Anti-
Doping Agency (WADA) also seems to indicate that performance
enhancement may be present with administration of analgesic
substances (WADA, 2015). This area is poorly explored and

Supplements for Intense Endurance Performance
confer ethical considerations even though the net response of
a reduced perception of effort appears similar to caffeine, albeit
by different methods and with different potential side effects
(Doherty et al., 2004; Lane et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2014).
For future studies we encourage use of individual data and
ideally repeated use of a given supplement to better discriminate
between day-to-day variation and true performance effects
for the individual subject/athlete. This may also shed light
on potential mechanisms for a supplement (not) to work if
combined with other measures such as dietary habits, gender,
muscle fiber distribution, mitochondrial capacity, buffer capacity,
lactate production and adrenergic response during exercise.
CONCLUSION
Using a meta-analytic approach with a strict focus on “closed-
end” (e.g., time-trials or fixed duration) intense endurance
performance tests lasting from 45 s to 8 min, prior intake of
caffeine or bicarbonate demonstrated a small positive effect on
average speed being significantly different from placebo. Nitrate
had a trivial effect on performance and weakly tended to be
faster than placebo, but at present nitrate appears most relevant
for non-elite athletes or athletes with modest aerobic power.
Lastly beta-alanine effects on intense endurance performance
was trivial. For all supplements, individualized approaches are
advised since factors such as diet, gender, supplement uptake
kinetics, muscle oxidative capacity and fiber distribution may
impact on whether an ergogenic effect can be obtained.
