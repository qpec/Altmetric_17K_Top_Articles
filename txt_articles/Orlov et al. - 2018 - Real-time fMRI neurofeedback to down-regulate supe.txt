Abstract
Neurocognitive models and previous neuroimaging work posit that auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) arise due to
increased activity in speech-sensitive regions of the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG). Here, we examined if
patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and AVH could be trained to down-regulate STG activity using real-time functional
magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF). We also examined the effects of rtfMRI-NF training on
functional connectivity between the STG and other speech and language regions. Twelve patients with SCZ and
treatment-refractory AVH were recruited to participate in the study and were trained to down-regulate STG activity
using rtfMRI-NF, over four MRI scanner visits during a 2-week training period. STG activity and functional connectivity
were compared pre- and post-training. Patients successfully learnt to down-regulate activity in their left STG over the
rtfMRI-NF training. Post- training, patients showed increased functional connectivity between the left STG, the left
inferior prefrontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal gyrus. The post-training increase in functional connectivity
between the left STG and IFG was associated with a reduction in AVH symptoms over the training period. The speech-
sensitive region of the left STG is a suitable target region for rtfMRI-NF in patients with SCZ and treatment-refractory
AVH. Successful down-regulation of left STG activity can increase functional connectivity between speech motor and
perception regions. These findings suggest that patients with AVH have the ability to alter activity and connectivity in
speech and language regions, and raise the possibility that rtfMRI-NF training could present a novel therapeutic
intervention in SCZ.
Introduction
Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a cardinal
feature of schizophrenia (SCZ), occurring in around 70%
of patients with the illness1. They are associated with high
levels of distress as well as functional and occupational
disability2. In 30% of patients with AVH, traditional
antipsychotic drugs have little or no effect3. Thus, there is
a clear need for an enhanced understanding of the neural
systems that underlie AVH and how function within these
systems can be altered.
The neural basis of AVH in patients with SCZ is not
fully understood. However, over the last few decades,
neuroimaging techniques have allowed researchers to
identify brain regions associated with AVH4,5. There is
now consensus that AVH are associated with a functional
network of brain areas including auditory and language
regions in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and inferior
parietal gyrus (IPG), and speech motor regions in the
inferior prefrontal cortex/gyrus (IFG), as well as cortical

 midline region around the cingulate cortex and para-
cingulate sulcus4,6–8. Hyperactivity in the posterior STG, a
region sensitive to speech and human voices9, is a parti-
cularly robust neuroimaging finding in patients with SCZ
and AVH4,7,8. The posterior STG has been shown to
spontaneously activate during silence10 and increased
resting activity 11 and cerebral perfusion in this sensory
region12 have also been reported in people with AVH.
These findings are consistent with neuroimaging studies
employing
a
“symptom-capture
design”
that
show
increased activity in the STG and temporo-parietal lan-
guage regions when patients with SCZ are actively
experiencing AVH8. Moreover, altered neuronal con-
nectivity between STG and speech motor areas in the
inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) has also been reported. Dys-
connectivity between STG and speech motor regions in
the IFG13–16 may impair the ability of the motor system to
convey information about the sensory consequences of
self-generated actions, such as inner speech, to sensory
regions. Such a defective prediction mechanism may
result in the failure of the normal attenuation of sensory
response in the speech-sensitive STG to self-generated
speech14,17,18.
Building on these neuroimaging findings, transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have shown that a
reduction in the cortical excitability of temporo-parietal
sensory regions can reduce AVH severity19,20. Whilst this
approach has the advantage of establishing causal links
between these regions and AVH, it is often unattractive to
patients as it involves the application of a strong magnetic
pulse. Furthermore, changes in network dynamics cannot
be readily investigated using TMS in isolation. Real-time
functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback
(rtfMRI-NF) offers an alternative approach, as it can be
better targeted than TMS, and it allows individuals to
monitor and self-regulate their own brain activity21,22.
During rtfMRI-NF, brain activity is measured in real time
and fed back to participants so that they can progressively
achieve voluntary control over their own neural activity21.
Precisely defining the target brain area or network is
important for rtfMRI-NF protocols and the vastly super-
ior spatial resolution of MRI, as compared to alternative
neurofeedback protocols using electroencephalography,
allows the feedback signal to be better localized. rtfMRI-
NF studies in patients with SCZ are limited, but a recent
case report shows subjective improvements in some
aspects of three patients’ AVH when rtfMRI-NF was
applied to the anterior cingulate cortex23. rtfMRI-NF
experiments could make a major contribution to our
understanding of the brain regions and networks involved
in AVH and, crucially, could enable us to test if people
with SCZ can be trained to alter activity and connectivity
in these networks.
The aim of the current study was to investigate, for the
first time, whether patients with SCZ and AVH could
learn to down-regulate left STG activity using an rtfMRI-
NF training protocol. We also examined if left STG down-
regulation would lead to network connectivity changes in
speech motor and sensory regions. We chose to use the
speech-sensitive region in the posterior STG as our
rtfMRI-NF target region as it has been shown to be
activated during AVH8, to be tonically hyperactive in
patients with AVH12, can be functionally localized9, and
can be effectively down-regulated by rtfMRI-NF train-
ing24. Changes in STG activity have also been shown to
alter connections with other brain regions in healthy
volunteers25. Specifically, we predicted that rtfMRI-NF
training, targeting the voice-sensitive region of the STG,
would reduce activity in this region, and enhance func-
tional connectivity between left STG and other fronto-
temporal speech and language regions. Exploratory ana-
lyzes of clinical data examined if changes in AVH symp-
tom severity were related to neurofunctional changes.
Methods
Participants
Twelve right-handed participants with a Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition26
diagnosis of SCZ or schizoaffective disorder were recrui-
ted to the study from the South London and Maudsely
NHS Trust in London, UK. Patients were required to
provide written informed consent and to be treated with
stable doses of antipsychotic medication for the 3 months
prior to study enrollment. Participants who met the cri-
teria for alcohol or substance dependence in the previous
6 months were excluded. The inclusion criteria required a
score of ≥3 on the hallucinatory behavior (P3) item of the
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)27,28,. The
study was approved by the Stanmore National Research
Ethics Committee (REC number 15/LO/1007); all study
procedures have been conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Participants were required to attend the study on five
separate visits (Fig. 1). Baseline clinical assessments were
conducted on the first day. The four subsequent visits for
MRI scans were completed over a 2-week period. Clinical
assessments were also completed during these visits.
Assessment included the PANSS at baseline and after the
last fMRI visit, and the Psychotic Rating Symptom Scale
(PsyRats)29 hallucination subscale at baseline, after each
rtfMRI-NF scan (visits 2–4), and 1 week post fMRI.
Intelligence quotient (IQ) was assessed using subsets
(Matrix reasoning, and vocabulary) of the Wechsler
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence30. The PANSS and
PsyRats instruments were administered by an indepen-
dent researcher (MS), who was blind to the study protocol
and objectives.

 Imaging data acquisition
Functional images were acquired on a General Electric
MR750 3.0 T MR scanner at the Department of Neuroi-
maging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neu-
roscience, King’s College London (London, UK). A 12-
channel head coil was used for radio frequency trans-
mission and reception. A single-shot gradient recalled
echo planar imaging sequence was used for fMRI acqui-
sition (64 × 64 matrix over a 21.1 × 21.1 cm2 field of view
(FOV), giving an in-plane voxel size of 3.3 mm; slice
thickness 3 mm with a 0.3 mm slice gap; repetition time
(TR) = 2000ms; echo time (TE) = 30ms, flip angle = 75°).
A high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted
enhanced gradient echo (256 × 256 matrix over a 27 × 27
cm2 FOV, giving an in-plane voxel size of 1.05 mm; slice
thickness 1.2 mm; TR = 7.312 ms, TE = 3.015 ms, flip
angle = 11°) scan was acquired for image normalization.
The first four volumes of each rtfMRI-NF run were dis-
carded
to
allow
steady-state
magnetization
to
be
established.
Localizer scan
During the first visit participants underwent a localizer
scan to identify voice-sensitive regions in their left STG.
This consisted of a voice perception task comprising
blocks of vocal and non-vocal stimuli9. Vocal stimuli were
words for everyday objects neutral in semantic and pro-
sodic content, whereas the non-vocal stimuli were based
on non-speech digitalized sounds with amplitude and
energy matched with control sounds. The presentation
was alternated, with a total of eight 20 s blocks of vocal
and seven 20 s blocks of non-vocal stimuli, lasting
approximately 5 min in total. Stimuli loudness was
adjusted individually, to ensure that participants could
hear the stimuli clearly above the scanner noise. To create
a functional mask from which to derive the rtfMRI-NF
signal, we calculated the effective signal change in areas
activated by the functional localizer task using conven-
tional univariate fMRI analysis techniques. This was based
on the task contrast of the average BOLD signal between
the activation block (vocal stimuli) and the baseline block
(non-vocal stimuli). Online pre-processing and analysis
were conducted using AFNI software (https://afni.nimh.
nih.gov/) and using local scripts written and developed by
the author V.G. In short, the data were smoothed and
corrected for head motion. The contrast vocal > non-
vocal was chosen and faces touching clusters with the
highest t-statistic were displayed (https://afni.nimh.nih.
gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dclust.html). The indi-
vidual functional masks were created based on the
maximally activated cluster in the left posterior STG by
manually thresholding the target cluster until the required
size/shape was present in the left posterior STG (ROISTG).
The left STG was chosen because this region is typically
active during AVH. We used white matter as a reference
region to cancel out non-specific global brain effects
Fig. 1 Study design. Participants attended five study visits. During the baseline visit participants were assessed on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and
clinical and socio-demographic information was collected. During the first scanning visit a mask of the speech-sensitive left STG was created for each
participant using the functional localizer task: inc/exc inclusion/exclusion, WASI Wechsler Abbreviate Scale of Intelligence, PsyRats Psychotic
Symptom Rating Scale, PANSS Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, rtfMRI-NF real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback

 (ROIREF): a white matter mask was created by segmenting
the T1-weighted structural image in AFNI, eroding to
limit partial volume effects, and mapping it onto the
functional localizer mask by reversing the normalization
process.
rtfMRI-NF data acquisition and processing
A custom rtfMRI-NF interface system31 and AFNI
software32 were used for real-time transfer and analysis of
fMRI data. The rtfMRI-NF interface system ran on the
scanner hardware to access the fMRI scans as they were
reconstructed. The images were then transferred to a
Linux workstation where they were pre-processed using
AFNI’s built in real-time capabilities. Once the target in
the STG ROI (ROISTG) had been identified using the
functional localizer described above, the neurofeedback
signal
was
calculated
using
the
formula:
((ROIST-
G−ROIREF)−(ROI STG Previous−ROIREF Previous)), where
the previous ROIs are the average activation of the left
STG and references regions in the previous rest block.
Thus, the NF signal was a function of the difference of the
current ROISTG activity (averaged over 3 TR periods in
order to reduce jitter) to the average of the previous rest
block, with all values being measured relative to the
corresponding
white
matter
signal
(changes
which
represent global signal variations of no interest).
rtfMRI-NF training
Each rtfMRI-NF training run comprised a block design
similar to that used in previous studies24,33. Each rtfMRI-
NF training run alternated between no-regulation “rest”
blocks (7 blocks of 30 s) and down-regulation blocks (6
blocks of 50 s), lasting around 9 min per run. To motivate
participants during training runs, and to provide a more
visually engaging task, we used a visual feedback interface
depicting a “vertically orientated space rocket”33. Partici-
pants were instructed to land the rocket by bringing it
down to Earth. Visual feedback was provided during the
training blocks, and during the rest block participants
observed a fixation cross. After each visit participants
reported the strategy that they used to down-regulate
their left STG activity. Participants were informed about
the inherent delay in feedback due to the hemodynamic
response (approx. 6 s). To enhance motivation and the
likelihood of successful left STG signal down-regulations,
we did not provide any overt instructions or suggest any
strategies; participants were asked to devise their own
strategy to down-regulate their left STG signal34,35 (Sup-
plementary material). All participants attended four 1-h
visits for MRI. The functional localizer task was com-
pleted during the first scanner visit. During visits 2, 3, and
4, participants completed between 2 and 6 rtfMRI-NF
training runs depending on the time available (mean
number of runs per scanner v2 = 4.8, v3 = 4.5, v4 = 3.6).
During the fourth (final) visit, participants also undertook
a “transfer” run. The transfer run was identical to the
training runs except that no visual feedback (static pic-
ture) was given. This allowed the overall success of the
training to be assessed (i.e., participants’ ability to down-
regulate their STG signal in the absence of direct feed-
back). Participants were informed that the picture would
remain static, and were asked to employ the same stra-
tegies they used during the rtfMRI-NF training. Transfer
runs measure retention of learning and are considered a
proximal measure of successful transfer of training stra-
tegies to everyday life.
Data analysis
Clinical data
To assess overall clinical change, and any adverse effect
of the study procedures on clinical presentation, we
conducted a paired t test for PANSS scores pre and post
rtfMRI-NF training. To investigate the specific change in
AVH symptoms over the rtfMRI-NF training period, we
analyzed the total PsyRats AVH symptoms score by spe-
cifying a full maximum-likelihood random-effect multi-
level model (MLREM)36. Post hoc exploratory analyses
examined changes over the rtfMRI-NF training period in
individual PsyRats items using one-sided, paired-sample t
tests. These results are reported at an uncorrected
threshold of p < 0.05, but no tests survived correction for
multiple testing (p = 0.05/11). Data distribution checks
and statistical analyses were carried out using STATA
12.1.
fMRI data analysis
All offline data were pre-processed and analyzed using
Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12). All functional
data were slice-timed corrected and realigned, to correct
for volume-to-volume head motion. Following this, the
time series was co-registered to the high-resolution T1-
weighted image, and normalized into the Montreal Neu-
rological Institute (MNI) template using parameters
generated by unified segmentation of the T1-weighted
structural image37. The transformed data were smoothed
using an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic
Gaussian kernel. For the localizer task subject-specific
fixed models were constructed with regressors encoding
the predicted blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
response for vocal stimuli and non-vocal stimuli blocks.
For the rtfMRI-NF runs, subject-specific fixed-effects
models were constructed with regressors encoding the
predicted BOLD response for each of the rtfMRI-NF runs
(ranging from 9 to 16 across subjects), with baseline (rest)
blocks serving as the baseline. For both the localizer task
and the rtfMRI-NF runs, the six motion parameters for
each run, generated during realignment, were included as
nuisance regressors. For all first-level models voxelwise
Orlov et al. Translational Psychiatry  (2018) 8:46 
Page 4 of 10
 parameter estimates for these regressors were obtained by
restricted maximum-likelihood estimation using a tem-
poral high-pass filter (cutoff = 128 s) to remove low-
frequency drifts, and modeling temporal autocorrelation
across scans with an AR(1) process. Following parameter
estimation, contrasts of beta coefficients for the primary
contrasts of interest were generated. For the localizer task
the contrast was vocal stimuli > non-vocal stimuli. As the
number of rtfMRI-NF runs differed between participants
(9–16; mean = 14; median = 14), the second-level model
comprised contrasts for the first vs. last rtfMRI-NF run
acquired during the second, third, and fourth scanner
visits, entered into a repeated-measures analysis of var-
iance (ANOVA) (i.e., 6 contrasts). Finally, to check that
down-regulation effects in the left STG were not due to
repeated exposure to the rtfMRI-NF task (i.e., habitua-
tion) over runs within a single visit, we examined the main
effect of “visit” as this would be less prone to habituation
confounds, that is, patients would be unlikely to show
habituation in the left STG from visit to visit.
Transfer task
Using a separate model, subject-specific first-level
models were created using a regressor encoding the pre-
dicted response for the first rtfMRI-NF run vs. the
transfer run. Motion parameters generated during the
realignment for both runs were also included. A second-
level paired t test was used to test for effects in the left
STG. The association between changes in left STG
activity and changes in PsyRats total scores was investi-
gated using a regression model with a single contrast
image (first > transfer run) from each subject and their
corresponding change in PsyRats scores as a regressor.
In order to focus on signal change in voice-sensitive
regions of the left STG, we conducted analyses within the
mean left STG ROI created by the localizer task (contrast:
vocal stimuli > non-vocal stimuli). First, we adjusted
obliqueness to match the individual T1-weighted struc-
tural image, removed the white matter control regions,
and transformed the individual masks into MNI space,
using parameters generated by unified segmentation of
the T1 image. The mean mask was then computed using
ImCalc in SPM12 based on the transformed individual
functional localizer masks (Fig. 2a). For all second-level
analyses, significant ROI results are reported at a p value
of ≤0.05 following family-wise error correction on the
basis of response amplitude (i.e., peak-level family-wise
error (FWE)).
Psychophysiological interactions
The effect of rtfMRI-NF training on functional con-
nectivity was investigated by a PPI analysis with a left STG
seed region derived from the group ANOVA analysis.
First, the eigenvariate from the seed region extracted from

 the subject-specific models described above. We used a 6
mm radius sphere, to pin the PPI analysis seed within the
cluster size obtained in the repeated-measures ANOVA.
Subject-specific response peak were required to be within
the 6 mm of the group peak to be included in the PPI
analysis. This was the case for all participants. Subse-
quently, two PPI regressors were created via deconvolu-
tion of the eigenvariate time series and by weighting of the
resultant time series with the task contrast time series (the
first and last rtfMRI-NF run). The regressors were
adjusted for the effect of interest, and reconvoled with the
hemodynamic response function to provide the predicted
temporal pattern of BOLD signal that would be expected
in a region if its connectivity was changed when the seed
is modulated by the rtfMRI-NF run (i.e., first vs. last). The
resulting two contrasts (from the first and last rtfMRI-NF
runs) were tested with a paired-sample t test at the
second-level analysis. Given our interest in functional
connectivity changes in frontal and temporal speech and
language regions activated during AVH, we studied
changes in two ROIs taken from a meta-analysis of
functional imaging studies in patients with AVH. An IFG
(Broca’s area) ROI was specified using MNI coordinates
(−48, 10, 8) and an ROI in the supramarginal gyrus was
specified using (−52, −20, 15). Associations between left
STG ROI functional connectivity and changes in PsyRats
total scores were investigated using a regression model.
PPI results are reported at a p value of ≤0.025 following
FWEpeak and correction for two ROIs.
Results
Patient characteristics and symptoms
Patients’ clinical and socio-demographic information
characteristics and IQ are reported in Table 1. One par-
ticipant’s data was excluded due to excessive movements
during the fMRI acquisition. Therefore, data in 11 parti-
cipants were analyzed. rtfMRI-NF training did not worsen
clinical symptoms as assessed by the PANSS scores (pre
vs. post training scores) (Table 2.)
There was a trend effect for reduced PsyRats Total
scores pre vs. post rtfMRI-NF training (Table 2). MLREM
revealed a significant change in PsyRats Total scores over
the rtfMRI-NF training period p = 0.015; (b = −0.76, 95%
confidence interval: −1.38 to 0.15). Exploratory analysis of
PsyRats sub-items showed that there was a post training
reduction in scores for PsyRats item 5 (beliefs regarding
the origin of voices) (p = 0.05, t = 1.91) and PsyRats Item
9 (Intensity of distress) (p = 0.02, t = 2.34). The post
training effect for item 5 was maintained at a trend level
(p = 0.055, t = 1.77) at 1-week follow-up. However, single
PsyRats item effects did not survive correction for mul-
tiple testing.
Localizer scan
Across all participants the functional localizer task
activated the left STG. Compared to non-vocal stimuli,
vocal stimuli activated the voice-sensitive posterior left
STG (x, y, z = −64, −14, 4); (t 1(10) = 3.16 [tpeak = 5.76]
KE = 294, PFWE = 0.02, z-scorepeak = 3.74) with a sub-
peak at (x, y, z = −64, −26, −4); ([tpeak = 5.59], PFWE =
0.02, z-scorepeak = 3.68) (Fig. 2a).

 rtfMRI-NF training
There was a significant decrease in activity over rtfMRI-
NF training runs in a cluster of KE = 405 in the left STG/
superior temporal sulcus (x, y, z = −60, −30, 20); (t 1(60)
= 2.39 [tpeak = 4.22], PFWE = 0.013, z-scorepeak = 3.93),
extending to the supramarginal gyrus/IPG (x, y, z = −58,
−36, 24); (t
1(60) = 2.39 [tpeak = 3.48], PFWE = 0.09, z-
scorepeak = 3.31) (Fig. 2b, c). There were no regions within
the left STG ROI that showed increased activation over
the course of the rtfMRI-NF. The down-regulation effect
in the left STG ROI was significant across visits 2, 3, and 4
(x, y, z = −60, −28, 20); (t1(60) = 2.39[tpeak = 4.26], PFWE =
0.011, z-scorepeak = 3.96). Over the rtfMRI-NF training
protocol, there was no suprathreshold effect during the
baseline blocks, that is, STG ROI activity during baseline
blocks remained stable across the training protocol.
Transfer task
Relative to the first rtfMRI-NF training run, there was a
significant reduction in activity in the left STG ROI dur-
ing the transfer run x, y, z = (−60, −28, 16); (t 1(10) =2.76
[tpeak = 6.59]; KE = 156, PFWE = 0.03, z-scorepeak = 3.99).
PPI analysis
Using the seed region in the left posterior STG, PPI
analysis revealed greater functional connectivity para-
meter estimates during the last rtfMRI-NF, relative to the
first rtfMRI-NF run in a cluster covering the left insula
extending to the left IFG (x, y, z = −48, 10, 2) (t1(10) =6.66
[tpeak = 6.38]; KE = 34, PFWE = 0.002, z- scorepeak = 3.94)
and in a cluster in the supramarginal gyrus/IPG (x, y, z, =
−52, −20, 16), (t1(10) = 4.14 [tpeak = 5.11]; KE = 81, PFWE
= 0.011, z-scorepeak = 3.51) (Fig. 3b). There were no areas
where functional connectivity decreased after rtfMRI-NF
training.
PsyRat associations
A regression model testing the association between left
STG down-regulation during the transfer run (1st run vs.
transfer run) and changes in PsyRats Total scores was
non-significant. There was, however, a significant positive
association between change in PsyRat Total scores over
the rtfMRI-NF training period (pre–post training scores)
and functional connectivity between the left STG seed
region and the left insula/IFG during the last rtfMRI-NF
run (x, y, x = −48, 12, 4); (t1(09) = 1.83 [tpeak = 6.77]; KE
= 233, PFWE =0.01, z-scorepeak = 3.90).
Discussion
We showed in this pioneering study that patients with
SCZ and AVH could learn to down-regulate activity in
speech-sensitive regions of their left STG with an average
of 14 runs of 9 min NF training. Left STG down-
regulation was seen between scanner visits suggesting
that this effect could not easily be attributed to within visit
STG habituation over rtfMRI-training runs. Furthermore,
rtfMRI-NF training resulted in increased functional con-
nectivity between frontal and temporal language regions
that was associated with changes in AVH symptom
severity. During the transfer scan, patients were able to
reduce activity without visually presented feedback, sug-
gesting that they had learnt strategies to reduce activity in
the voice-sensitive region of the left STG.
It has been reported that AVH are associated with
spontaneous brain activity10, increase in blood flow12, and
increased resting state activity in the posterior STG11.
Reduced activity in the left STG brought about by rtfMRI-
NF training demonstrates that participants can develop
and apply an endogenous technique to regulate brain
activity in this region, known to be involved in linguistic
perception5, and active when patients with SCZ are
experiencing AVH4. However, although activity in the
posterior STG region appears to be central to the per-
ceptual experience, dysfunction in non-sensory regions is
also likely to contribute to the phenomenological char-
acteristics of AVH4,5,38. Several studies have reported
altered functional13,15,16,39 and structural connectivity40 in
fronto-temporal and perisylvian language networks. In the
present study, the enhanced coupling between the pos-
terior STG seed region and the insula/IFG brought about
by rtfMRI-NF training is of particular interest. The IFG
region contains the speech motor area (i.e., Broca’s area),
also reported to be active during AVH4. Moreover, the
subjective reality of AVH is associated with increased
activity in the IFG41, a region involved in both inner
speech and in the imagination of others’ speech42–44.
Inner-speech models of AVH posit that increased activity
in speech perception regions in the posterior STG is a
consequence of reduced or defective signaling from
speech motor areas; that is, speech motor regions fail to
attenuate sensory activation in the STG14,45,46. Conse-
quently, this failure can produce confusion regarding the
agency between one’s own actions/inner-speech and
externally generated actions such as perceived voices and
speech47. The finding of increased coupling between the
posterior STG region and the left insula (part of the same
IFG cluster) is also of interest. This region is thought to be
an extension of Broca’s convolution important for verbal
imagery48 and volumetric change in the insula has been
shown to be correlated with the intensity of AVH49.
Functional connectivity analysis also revealed increased
coupling between the posterior STG seed region and a
cluster just superior to the seed region in the left IPG/
supramarginal gyrus, which is part of Wernicke’s area,
and is known to be involved in speech processing50.
Reduced white matter integrity between left posterior
STG and IPG has been reported previously in SCZ
patients with AVH40, suggesting reduced connectivity

 within speech and language perception areas, as well as
with more distal speech motor regions in the IFG. A
recent functional imaging study in SCZ patients with
AVH, reports that patients displayed a deficit in predic-
tion errors signaling in the posterior STG; the same
region activated when patients experience AVH51. It is
possible that sensory hyperactivity in speech perception
regions may arise through sensory learning and predictive
coding deficits within these regions, influencing prior
beliefs on sensory input. Such a learning mechanism may
rely on efficient coupling within speech and language
regions.
Overall, rtfMRI-NF training reduced activity in the
posterior, speech-sensitive, STG, resulting in increased
coupling between inferior frontal and posterior temporal
speech and language regions. These findings are broadly
consistent with TMS studies that report a reduction in
AVH symptomatology after low-frequency TMS is used
to reduce cerebral perfusion in the STG, IFG (and
cingulate cortex) measured with arterial spin labeling52.
However, compared to rTMS, rtfMRI-NF protocols can
be more targeted, helping to establish causality of asso-
ciations between functional and clinical phenotypes. The
study has some limitations that should be discussed. We
did not combine our functional localizer with an anato-
mical mask, which would help to define the left STG.
However, as can been seen Fig. 2a, our task isolated the
left STG and contiguous inferior parietal cortex, that is,
brain regions associated with the speech-sensitive cortex
and regions that are associated with AVH. Further, the
sample size was small and we did not compare our
experimental group to a control condition (e.g., a sham
rtfMRI-NF condition). Thus, it cannot be ruled out that
the reduced left STG activity observed over the training
period was a placebo effect of some kind. We will now
need to conduct a larger randomized control trial to
exclude this possibility and to test if rtfMRI-NF training
can be used as a novel therapeutic intervention in people

 with SCZ and AVH. It does seem, however, that patients
with SCZ and AVH do have the ability to regulate activity
(neural plasticity, i.e., alter the functional organization of
the brain) in speech sensory–motor regions, in contrast to
suggestions that patients have a general deficit in cortical
plasticity53. This may open the way for wider investiga-
tions using neurotherapies, such as rtfMRI-NF, in people
with SCZ.
