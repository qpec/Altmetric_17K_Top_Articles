ABSTRACT
The American Society of Nephrology recommends against routine cancer screening among asymptomatic
patients receiving maintenance dialysis on the basis of limited survival benefit. To determine the frequency
of colorectal cancer screening among patients on dialysis and the extent to which screening tests were
targeted toward patients at lower risk of death and higher likelihood of receiving a kidney transplant, we
performed a cohort study of 469,574 Medicare beneficiaries ages $50 years old who received dialysis
between January 1, 2007 and September 30, 2012. We examined colorectal cancer screening tests accord-
ing to quartiles of risk of mortality and kidney transplant on the basis of multivariable Cox modeling. Over
a median follow-up of 1.5 years, 11.6% of patients received a colon cancer screening test (57.9 tests per
1000 person-years). Incidence rates of colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and fecal occult blood test
were 27.9, 0.6, and 29.5 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Patients in the lowest quartile of mortality
risk were more likely to be screened than those in the highest quartile (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence
interval, 1.49 to 1.57; 65.1 versus 46.4 tests per 1000 person-years, respectively), amounting to a 33%
higher rate of testing. Additionally, compared with patients least likely to receive a transplant, patients
most likely to receive a transplant were more likely to be screened (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence
interval, 1.64 to 1.73). Colon cancer screening is being targeted toward patients on dialysis at lowest risk of
mortality and highest likelihood of transplantation, but absolute rates are high, suggesting overscreening.

Colorectal cancer screening among patients with
ESRD on dialysis presents a conundrum to primary
care providers and nephrologists. Many patients on
dialysis qualify for screening on the basis of age-based
recommendations, such as those released by the US
PreventiveServicesTaskForceandrecentlyupdatedin
2016, which advocate for screening all adults ages 50–
75 years old with a fecal occult blood test (FOBT)
annually, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or colono-
scopy every 10 years.1 Furthermore, patients with
ESRD may receive a colonoscopy as part of an eval-
uation of candidacy for kidney transplantation.
However, the American College of Physicians calls
for more restraint with an individualized patient as-
sessment of mortality risk, recommending against
screening adults who have a life expectancy of ,10
years.2 Given that no group of patients on dialysis
over 50 years of age has a life expectancy longer
than 10 years,3 patients with ESRD are unlikely to

 benefit from routine cancer screening. Indeed, prior studies have
shown that screening for colon cancer failed to provide patients
on dialysis a substantial survival benefit due to the high risk of
mortality associated with ESRD.4–6 Consequently, as partner of
the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Choosing
Wisely campaign, the American Society of Nephrology (ASN)
in 2012 recommended against routine cancer screening among
patients receiving maintenance dialysis “with limited life expec-
tancy and without signs or symptoms.”7
Althoughagrowing bodyofliteraturehasshownpotentially
inappropriate colorectal cancer screening in various popula-
tions, no studies have documented the rate of colorectal cancer
screening specifically among patients with ESRD. Mittal et al.8
reported that one quarter of Medicare beneficiaries with a life
expectancy under 10 years underwent colonoscopy. Another
study among elderly veterans found that rates of screening
declined among patients over 80 years of age, but life expec-
tancy was not a major predictor of screening, suggesting that
clinicians are following age-based guidelines and may not be
incorporating life expectancy into clinical decision making.9
We sought to determine the frequency and patterns of co-
lorectalcancerscreening practiceamong patientswithESRDin
the UnitedStates. Specifically,we hoped to determineifscreen-
ing was being performed among those who would stand to
benefit most: patients at lower risk of death and higher likeli-
hood of receiving transplanted kidneys.
RESULTS
We identified 469,574 patients on dialysis during the period of
interest and without prior kidney transplantation or diagnosis of
cancer (Figure 1). Patient characteristics according to quartiles
of estimated mortality risk are summarized in Table 1, and char-
acteristics according to quartiles of likelihood of receipt of a
transplant are in Supplemental Table 1. Patients were followed
for a median of 1.5 years (interquartile range, 0.7–3.0). Overall,
11.6% (n=54,552 patients) were screened for colon cancer dur-
ing the follow-up period; 48.4% (n=227,221 patients) died and
40.0% (n=187,801 patients) reached the end of the study period
without receiving a screening test. Among those receiving a co-
lon cancer screening, the most frequent tests were FOBT
(n=27,762 patients; 50.9% of those screened) and colonoscopy
(n=26,262 patients; 48.1% of those screened). Flexible sigmoid-
oscopy was used in1.0% ofthose screened (n=528 patients).The
overall screening test rate was 57.9 events per 1000 person-years.
Colonoscopies were performed at a rate of 27.9 per 1000 person-
years, flexible sigmoidoscopies were performed at a rate of
0.56 per 1000 person-years, and FOBTs were performed at a
rate of 29.5 per 1000 person-years.
Frequency and Rates According to Quartiles of
Mortality Risk
Our mortality model achieved good separation, with a median
survival of 1.61 years (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.59
to 1.63) in the quartile at highest risk and .5 years in the
quartile at lowest risk of mortality (Figures 2A). Patients at
lower risk of death had a higher likelihood of being screened
(Figure 2B). Fifteen percent of the patients in the lowest quar-
tile of mortality risk underwent a colon cancer screening test,
most commonly by colonoscopy (n=10,550). In contrast, 7%
of those in the highest quartile of mortality risk were screened,
most commonly by FOBT (n=5785) (Figure 3).
Overall, patients in the lowest quartile of mortality risk
received 19 additional screening tests per 1000 person-years
compared with patients at highest risk of death (65 versus 46,
respectively) (Table 2). The screening test modality also varied
according to risk of mortality, with greater use of invasive
testing among the healthiest quartile of patients (38.0 colonos-
copies per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 3.09; 95%
CI, 2.94 to 3.24; P,0.001) compared with 13.7 colonoscopies
per 1000 person-years in the quartile of patients with the high-
est risk of death. Rates of FOBTwere fairly similar in the lowest
compared with highest quartile of mortality risk, although the
difference reached statistical significance (HR, 0.90; 95% CI,
0.87 to 0.93; P,0.001).
Whenwe stratified the follow-up time according to whether
patients were waitlisted for kidney transplantation, we found
that most procedures occurred while patients were not on the
waitlist (82%),butrateswerehigherduring timeonthewaitlist
(Table 2). The association between quartile of mortality risk
and colon cancer screening differed during follow-up on the
waitlist versus while patients were not on the transplant wait-
list for any testing and colonoscopy (P,0.001 for interaction)
(Table 2). Whereas the results were similar to the overall re-
sults for the follow-up time when patients were not on the
waitlist, with a gradient according to mortality risk (HR, 1.44;
95% CI, 1.40 to 1.49 for any procedure and HR, 2.97; 95% CI,
2.82 to 3.12 for colonoscopy), there was no significant associ-
ation between quartile of mortality risk and these procedures
during the time that patients were on the transplant waitlist.
Frequency and Rates of Screening Tests According to
Quartiles of Likelihood of Transplantation
Patients most likely to receive a kidney transplant had 26 more
tests per 1000 person-years compared with those least likely to
receive a transplant (69 versus 44, respectively). Although pa-
tients with the highest chance of transplant were three times as
likely to receive a colonoscopy (HR, 3.17; 95% CI, 3.03 to 3.32)
comparedwiththosewiththelowestchanceoftransplantation,
there was no statistically significant difference in likelihood of
receiving an FOBT between the two groups (HR, 1.02; 95% CI,
0.98 to 1.06).
DISCUSSION
We found that Medicare beneficiaries undergoing dialysis in
the United States who stood to benefit most from screening
(e.g., patients with the lowest risk of death and highest

 likelihood of kidney transplantation) received more colorectal
cancer screening overall and were also most likely to receive a
colonoscopy. When patients were examined according to risk
of mortality, the healthiest quartile of patients on dialysis re-
ceived over 24 more screening colonoscopies per 1000 person-
years than the sickest quartile of patients (38.0 versus 13.7 per
1000 person-years, respectively). The gradient of testing ac-
cording to risk of mortality was only observed for the testing
that was performed while patients were not on the transplant
waitlist, whereas testing seemed to be occurring less selectively
among those on the waitlist. These findings suggest that physi-
cians may well be taking life expectancy into account when
deciding to screen their patients for colon cancer.
Although patients with higher life expectancy were more
likely to receive a colon cancer screening test, the difference in
testing (Figure 2B) was less pronounced than the difference in
mortality (Figure 2A), and the overall test rate among patients
with ESRD may still be high after accounting for the short
median duration of follow-up (1.5 years). Although only
one in ten patients in our cohort received a colon cancer
screening test between January of 2007 and September of
2012, the rate was 57.9 per 1000 person-years (or 58 of 100
patients screened over 10 years), which approximates the 60%
of all United States adults over 50 years old who self-reported
being up to date with colorectal cancer screening in the Na-
tional Health Interview Survey in 2010.10 However, differences
in study design and our inability to exclude patients who may
have already been up to date with screening (thus potentially
underestimating screening rates in our cohort) limit comparison
between these values.
A recent study of Medicare claims data from 2001 to 2005
provides a more direct comparison. In that study, the rate of
screening colonoscopies was highest for individuals with the
longest life expectancy (27.2 screening colonoscopies per 1000
person-years among individuals with an estimated life expec-
tancy of 10–15 years) compared with only 3.4 per 1000 person-
years in the group with a life expectancy ,5 years.10 The
median survival in our cohort was 3.8 years, making our patients

 most comparable with the lowest life expectancy group from the
general Medicare population. Nevertheless, the overall rate of
27.9 colonoscopies per 1000 person-years in our cohort was
eightfold higher than the 3.4 per 1000 in the subgroup of Medi-
care beneficiaries with estimated survival of ,5 years and closer
to rates in individuals with life expectancies between 10 and 15
years. Our data suggest that patients undergoing dialysis are re-
ceiving screening tests at a much higher rate relative to their life
expectancy than their counterparts without ESRD.
Several potential explanations could be invoked to explain
the relatively high rate of screening among patients on dialysis.
Increased exposure to health care providers could lead to ad-
ditional testing and workup. Diagnosis of colon cancer occurs
at an earlier stage among patients with ESRD compared with
the general Medicare population, suggesting an increased like-
lihood of screening.11 However, other studies have failed to
link degree of comorbidity (a surrogate for health care expo-
sure) to screening rates.9,12 Underestimation of the mortality
of patients on dialysis by nephrologists and patients13 may
contribute to the relatively high rate of performance of these
tests. In addition, nephrologists rarely discuss prognosis with
patients on dialysis and their families.13 Primary care provid-
ers may also underestimate mortality in this population, be-
cause many of the available decision aids that help determine
which patients may benefit from screening do not include
ESRD as a risk factor for mortality.
Alternatively, additional colonoscopies could have been
performed as part of assessing a patient’s kidney transplanta-
tion candidacy. Indeed, we found that patients at higher likeli-
hood of transplantation were more likely to be screened.
However, even among patients with the lowest likelihood of
kidney transplantation, the colonoscopy rate was 14.1 per
1000 person-years, exceeding rates in the general Medicare pop-
ulation with low life expectancy. This relatively high rate among
patients with a low likelihood of receiving a kidney transplant—
and the high overall rate—suggest that patients with ESRD are
subject to screening, despite a likely limited benefit.
Our stratification strategy is a strength of the study. Strat-
ifying on the basis of risk of mortality produced groups with
very different life expectancies. In addition, because we were
unable to reliablyexclude procedures performed for transplant
evaluation, we developed a strategy of estimating a patient’s
likelihood of kidney transplantation, allowing us to draw con-
clusions on screening rates among patients who had a slim
likelihood of transplant. However, several potential limita-
tions of our study should be acknowledged. First, we
defined a screening test as any colonoscopy, flexible sigmoid-
oscopy, or FOBT billed without diagnosis codes, indicating
that it was performed for nonscreening purposes. A more
conservative definition restricted to codes that directly in-
cluded the word screening in the description would likely
have lowered our rate estimates. However, prior analyses
found underuse of these codes,14 and our approach has been
used in other studies.15 Second, we elected not to exclude
procedures associated with a diagnosis of anemia, which
may also have affected our results. Excluding anemia would
have lowered our rates but would likely have excluded true
screening procedures in patients with this highly prevalent
complication of ESRD. Third, we assumed that all patients
were eligible for screening at the time of entering our cohort,
because we did not have claims data for the prior 10 years to be
able to determine whether patients were up to date with
screening. This limitation would have the effect of underesti-
mating screening rates. Fourth, most of our study follow-up
preceded the ASN’s Choosing Wisely recommendation, which
was issued in April of 2012,7 and therefore, our study cannot
address whether the recommendation has had an effect on
screening behavior. In light of recent attention directed toward
improving resource utilization, our study provided several in-
teresting characterizations of recent use of cancer screening
tests among patients with ESRD in the United States. Although
more screening tests, particularly colonoscopy, were per-
formed among healthier patients with ESRD, overall rates sug-
gest the potential for a substantial degree of testing that would

 not lead to added survival benefit. FOBTwas the test of choice
among sicker patients, likely due to its lower cost and relatively
lower degree of invasiveness. There has been recent debate in
the general medical community about the optimal screening
strategy, with the US Preventive Services Task Force
recommending FOBT, colonoscopy, or sig-
moidoscopy as equally acceptable strate-
gies1 and European guideline groups
taking a more conservative stance in sup-
port of FOBTas the only strategy supported
by clinical effectiveness trials.16 Although
performing less invasive testing among
sicker patients on dialysis may seem advan-
tageous, less is known about optimal
screening for the dialysis population than
for the general population, and FOBT
may have a higher risk of false positivity
in the setting of heparin use in patients
on dialysis, which may limit its overall
cost-effectiveness and lead to additional
unnecessary testing.4
Future studies might be considered to
assess the effect of the ABIM’s Choosing
Wisely campaign and similar initiatives to
reduce waste in the health care system by
targeting screening to individuals most
likely to benefit. Our data can serve as ref-
erence and baseline for future studies that
assess the effect of the Choosing Wisely
campaign. Models like ours could also be
used to refine or operationalize the recom-
mendations. Because only those in the low-
est quartile of mortality risk had a median
survival longer than 5 years, screening of
patients who are not in this healthy subset
or undergoing evaluation for transplanta-
tion seems to be in contrast with the
Choosing Wisely recommendation.
CONCISE METHODS
Patient Population and Stratification
Using data from the US Renal Data System, the
national registry of patients with ESRD, we
assembled a cohort of 536,285 Medicare bene-
ficiaries ages 50 years old and older who received
maintenance chronic dialysis in the United
States between January 1, 2007 and September
30, 2012. Patients were excluded from analysis if
they had previously received a kidney transplant
(n=7254), were missing the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medical Ev-
idence Form 2728 (n=21,454), or carried a prior
diagnosis of any cancer (n=38,003) (Figure 1).
Patient Characteristics
We assembled data on patient characteristics from the ESRD Medical

patients with the highest risk of mortality had the shortest median time to death at 1.6

patients with the highest risk of mortality had the greatest probability of remaining free
from testing compared with those with the lowest risk of mortality. Kaplan–Meier curves

 facilities for all patients when they begin dialysis. We abstracted age,
sex, race, ethnicity, past medical history (diabetes, heart failure, hy-
pertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, prior
stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), substance use
history (alcohol, tobacco, and drug use), socioeconomic indicators
(median income according to zip code derived
from patient residence, insurance status at the
time of dialysis initiation, and current and pre-
vious employment), functional status indicators
(inpatient living status and inability to ambu-
late), geographic ESRD network, prior care
from a nephrologist, and laboratory values mea-
sured at the time of dialysis initiation (serum
albumin, creatinine, and hemoglobin concen-
trations).
Outcome Measures
Colon cancer screening was defined by FOBT,
flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy proce-
durebilledtoMedicareusingInternationalClas-
sification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
codes; Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)
codes; or Level II Healthcare Common Proce-
dure Coding System (HCPCS) codes. Included
codes were FOBT (CPT codes 82270, 82271, and
82274 and HCPCS code G0328), flexible sig-
moidoscopy (ICD-9 code 45.24; CPT codes
45330–45335, 45337–45342, and 45345; and
HCPCS code G0104), or colonoscopy (ICD-9
code 45.23; CPT codes 45378 and 45380–
45385; and HCPCS codes G0105 and G0121).
To eliminate tests ordered for reasons other than
screening, we excluded all procedures per-
formed in the inpatient setting. In addition,
we excluded outpatient procedures associated
with diagnosis codes for nonscreening indica-
tions, such as constipation, bowel obstruction,
diarrhea, infection, gastrointestinal bleed, in-
flammatory bowel disease, abdominal pain, or
abdominal mass (Supplemental Table 2). We
also excluded procedures associated with the di-
agnosis code for transplant evaluation, although
use of this code was rare. We did not exclude
procedures on the basis of a diagnosis of anemia
due to the high prevalence of this diagnosis
among patients with ESRD.
Statistical Analyses
To examine the extent towhich colorectal cancer
screening test rates varied according to life ex-
pectancy, we divided the cohort into quartiles of
mortality risk on the basis of death rate. We de-
rived these quartiles using multivariable Cox
proportional hazards models that included pa-
tient characteristics, comorbidities, and labora-
tory values. We included age, sex, race, ethnicity, past medical history,
substance use history, socioeconomic indicators, functional status
indicators, geographic ESRD network, prior care from a nephrologist,
and laboratory values measured at the time of dialysis initiation. We
modeled serum albumin in categories, including a missing category

 for the 24.4% of the cohort for whom serum albumin was not avail-
able. For other missing covariate data, we used multiple imputations
with ten imputed datasets.
We calculated the percentage of patients who received screening
tests during follow-up and the incident rate per 1000 person-years
across quartiles of risk for any screening test and each individual
procedure. Follow-up started on January 1, 2007 or the date thereafter
when dialysis was initiated, and it ended at the time of first colon
cancer screening procedure, date of death, or September 30, 2012,
whichever came first. For the models stratified by mortality risk,
censoring also included the date of kidney transplantation.
Although some patients had several procedures during the follow-
up period, there was no way to exclude subsequent tests that were
billed in error, redone due to laboratory rejection or inadequate bowel
preparation before colonoscopy, or performed as follow-up to a pre-
viously positive screening test rather than for screening, such as a
colonoscopy performed due to a positive FOBT result. Our primary
analysis, therefore, focused on the time to first screening procedure,
excluding any subsequent testing. If multiple procedures were billed
on the same day, we included the more invasive test (i.e., colonoscopy,
flexible sigmoidoscopy, and then, FOBT).
To assess whether screening test patterns varied according to the
risk of death, we used Cox models to calculate HRs comparing the
likelihood of screening among patients according to quartiles of risk
(i.e., univariate Cox models with quartile of risk of death as predictor
and screening event as the outcome).
Because we wereunable to reliably identify screening tests done for
the sole purposes of transplant evaluation using billing data, we used
twostrategies. First,we repeatedtheCoxmodel,stratifyingthefollow-
up time according to time on the kidney transplant waitlist and time
notonthewaitlist.Specifically,weincludedquartileofmortalityrisk,a
time-varying transplantwaitlistindicator,andthe interactionofquar-
tile of mortality risk and the waitlist indicator as predictors and ex-
amined the association of quartile of mortality risk with screening
procedures during waitlisted and nonwaitlisted intervals. Second, we
divided our cohort into quartiles on the basis of estimates of patients’
likelihood of undergoing kidney transplantation and examined the
association of transplant likelihood with colon cancer screening pro-
cedures. Using the same comorbidities and laboratory data, estimates
of likelihood of kidney transplantation were derived using the Fine–
Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model to accommodate
the competing risk of death. We then used Cox models to examine the
