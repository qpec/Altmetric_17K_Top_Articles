Abstract
Development of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a major challenge in the care of patients with pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in PDAC has been linked to a subset of 
cancer cells termed ‘cancer stem cells’ (CSCs). Therefore, an improved understanding of the molecular events underlying 
the development of pancreatic CSCs is required to identify new therapeutic targets to overcome chemoresistance. 
Accumulating evidence indicates that curcumin, a phenolic compound extracted from turmeric, can overcome de novo 
chemoresistance and re-sensitize tumors to various chemotherapeutic agents. However, the underlying mechanisms for 
curcumin-mediated chemosensitization remain unclear. The Enhancer of Zeste Homolog-2 (EZH2) subunit of Polycomb 
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) was recently identified as a key player regulating drug resistance. EZH2 mediates interaction 
with several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to modulate epithelial–mesenchymal transition and cancer stemness, 
phenomena commonly associated with drug resistance. Here, we report the re-sensitization of chemoresistant PDAC cells 
by curcumin through the inhibition of the PRC2-PVT1-c-Myc axis. Using gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cell lines, we found 
that curcumin sensitized chemoresistant cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of the PRC2 subunit EZH2 and its related 
lncRNA PVT1. Curcumin was also found to prevent the formation of spheroids, a hallmark of CSCs, and to down-regulate 
several self-renewal driving genes. In addition, we confirmed our in vitro findings in a xenograft mouse model where 
curcumin inhibited gemcitabine-resistant tumor growth. Overall, this study indicates clinical relevance for combining 
curcumin with chemotherapy to overcome chemoresistance in PDAC.
Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most 
aggressive malignancies and the fourth leading cause of cancer-
related deaths in the United States (1). While curative resection 
and chemotherapy is the standard of care for PDAC patients, 
in most cases it only provides a short-term survival benefit. 
Furthermore, the majority of these patients will eventually 
develop resistance to therapeutic drugs through several mech-
anisms including the activation of multidrug resistance and 
pro-survival pathways (2–4). There is accumulating evidence 
that cancer stem cells (CSCs) present in PDAC tumors, which 
have high tumorigenic abilities to self-renew and produce dif-
ferentiated progeny, contribute to chemoresistance (5–10). It is 
speculated that conventional chemotherapy reduces the tumor 
mass by affecting rapidly dividing PDAC cells that constitute 
the bulk of the tumor, but fails to target CSCs. This results in 
treatment failure and tumor recurrence (11). Therefore, a better

understanding of the molecular events characterizing pancre-
atic CSCs is necessary to identify improved therapeutic targets 
to overcome chemoresistance.
Enhancer of Zeste Homolog-2 (EZH2), a catalytic subunit 
of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is a histone methyl-
transferase that epigenetically maintains CSCs by regulating 
gene expression (12,13). A recent study found that EZH2 was 
overexpressed in the nucleus of ~70% of PDACs, highlighting its 
key oncogenic role in PDACs (14). Furthermore, overexpression 
of EZH2 in a PDAC cell line resulted in enhanced resistance to 
gemcitabine, a first-line drug for treatment of PDACs (14). One 
of the mechanisms by which EZH2 acts as an oncogene in PDAC 
is by modulating long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PVT1 (15–17), 
a known inducer of drug resistance in PDAC (18). While the 
roles of other non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs have been 
well established in cancers over the last decade, the functional 
roles of lncRNAs in cancers have only recently started to come 
to light. Several studies have therapeutically targeted EZH2 and 
PVT1 individually (13,18–21); however, whether co-targeting 
these two genes could further attenuate chemoresistance in 
pancreatic cancer remains to be determined.
Molecular inhibitors that specifically target certain genes or 
cellular pathways can only provide a short delay to almost inev-
itable cancer progression; cancer cells will eventually acquire 
resistance to these inhibitors by activating alternative cellular 
pathways. Multi-gene inhibitors can significantly prolong che-
mosensitivity over conventional therapeutic agents by simul-
taneously suppressing several oncogenic pathways. However, 
the likelihood of off-target effects as well as the complexities 
involved in the assessment of drug efficacy have hindered the 
development of such drugs. Over the past decades, numer-
ous studies have shown that curcumin, a phenolic compound 
extracted from Curcuma longa, has potent anti-inflammatory, 
anti-oxidant and anti-tumor properties (22,23). Furthermore, 
curcumin has been shown to sensitize chemotherapeutic agents 
in multiple cancers. In colorectal cancer, curcumin was shown 
to enhance cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil as well as FOLFOX 
(24,25). Similarly, curcumin sensitized cisplatin in head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer, further 
confirming chemosensitizing potential of curcumin (26,27). In 
PDACs, curcumin is known to simultaneously suppress mul-
tiple oncogenes, including vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, as well as genes 
involved in chemoresistance such as Akt, Erk and EZH2 (22,28). 
Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this potent natu-
ral compound that targets multiple signaling pathways with-
out noticeable side-effects has become a major avenue for the 
development of new cancer drugs. Many of the established 
chemoresistance-associated genes such as EZH2 have been 
confirmed to be targeted by curcumin (25,29). However, whether 
curcumin also modulates non-coding RNAs such as lncRNAs 
remains unexplored.
In this study, we generated a gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cell 
line. We examined acquired chemoresistance in these pancre-
atic cancer cells by comparing its properties to the gemcitabine-
sensitive parental cell line as well as to a PDAC cell line with 
inherent gemcitabine resistance. We found that in gemcitabine-
resistant PDAC cell lines PVT1 is up-regulated and that curcumin 
sensitizes some PDAC cells to gemcitabine. We noted that cur-
cumin down-regulates the expression of EZH2, PVT1 and their 
down-stream targets in gemcitabine-resistant cells. Moreover, 
curcumin also suppresses the spheroid-forming ability of gem-
citabine-resistant PDAC cells, indicating that curcumin spe-
cifically targets CSCs. Overall, this study establishes a potential 
clinical application for combining curcumin with chemotherapy 
to overcome chemoresistance in PDAC.
Materials and methods
Cell lines and materials
BxPC3, MiaPaCa2 and Panc1 PDAC cells were purchased from ATCC 
(Manassas, VA). BxPC3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, 
Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, 1% 
streptomycin (Gibco) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA). MiaPaCa2 and Panc1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine 
serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco). Gemcitabine-resistant 
BxPC3 (BxPC3-GemR) cell lines were established by treating BxPC3 cells 
with increasing concentrations of gemcitabine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, 
MO) over a duration of several months. This gemcitabine-resistant cell 
line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 
1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 µM gemcitabine. 
All cell lines were maintained at 37˚C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) 
and routinely tested and authenticated using a panel of genetic and epi-
genetic markers. Curcumin (BCM-95, Dolcas Biotech, NJ) was dissolved 
in DMSO and diluted to appropriate concentrations in culture medium. 
Gemcitabine was diluted in disulfide water.
Viability, cell cycle, apoptosis and clonogenic assays
To assess the viability of cells after treatments, cancer cells were seeded 
in 96-well plates (2–5 × 103 cells/well) and incubated for 72 h with cur-
cumin 
and/or 
gemcitabine. 
MTT 
[3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay was then conducted as described 
previously (30). In order to assess the synergism between curcumin and 
gemcitabine on viability, the combination index (CI) was calculated using 
the Chou–Talalay equation (31) at 50% inhibitory concentration. A CI index 
of less than 1 was considered to be a synergistic interaction. The percent-
ages of cells in the G0/G1, S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were deter-
mined using a Muse Cell Cycle Assay Kit /MCH10016 (Millipore, Billerica, 
MA), and the apoptotic cell fraction was measured using a Muse Annexin 
V and Dead Cell Assay Kit (Millipore) on a Muse™ Cell Analyzer (Millipore) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Clonogenic assays were per-
formed as described previously (30). The number of colonies (>50 cells) 
was counted using GeneTools (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). All experiments 
were conducted in triplicate on at least three different occasions.
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis
Cells in 12-well plates were treated with an IC50 concentration of cur-
cumin and/or gemcitabine, as determined by MTT assays (for BxPC3 
and BxPC3-GemR: 8 µM curcumin and 20 nM gemcitabine; for Panc1 
cells: 20 µM curcumin and 50 nM gemcitabine). After 48 h of treatment, 
total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany) and converted to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse 
Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 5 ng of the cDNA samples 
were mixed with 0.5 µl of 10 µM each of forward and reverse primers spe-
cific for the target genes, 5 µl SYBR GREEN Master Mix (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and 3.5 µl nuclease-free water (except for MALAT1 and HOTAIR 
gene expression analysis). For MALAT1 and HOTAIR, 5 ng cDNA samples 
were mixed with 1 µl TaqMan RNA Assay (20×) specific for target genes, 
10 µl TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (2×) (Applied Biosystems, Foster 
City, CA) and 8 µl nuclease-free water. β-actin was used as an endogenous 
control for both assays. Sequences of all primer sets used are shown in 
Supplementary Table 1, available at Carcinogenesis Online. For all experi-
ments, each sample was run in duplicate.

Western blotting
Following 48-h treatment with curcumin and/or gemcitabine, total cellu-
lar protein was extracted and western immunoblotting was performed as 
described previously (32). Supplementary Table 2, available at Carcinogenesis 
Online, lists the primary antibodies that were used. Secondary anti-mouse 
or anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology 
(Dallas, TX). β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a reference protein. All pro-
tein bands on the membranes were visualized using G:Box (Syngene), and 
the signal intensity of each band was calculated with GeneTools (Syngene).
Spheroid formation
Single-cell suspensions of the pancreatic cancer cells were prepared by 
mild enzymatic dissociation using TrypLE (Gibco). Cells were then seeded 
in 96-well Costar® ultra-low attachment plates (Corning, Corning, NY) at 
3000 cells/well in serum-free medium (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 
1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin (Gibco), 1% B27, 1% N2 (Gibco), 10 ng/ml 
human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Gibco) and 
20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, Sigma-Aldrich) and the cells were 
then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 to allow spheroid formation for 48 h. 
The spheroids were then treated with 8 µM curcumin and/or 20 nM gem-
citabine for 48 h and collected for further analysis.
Animal experiments
Five-week-old male athymic nude mice (Harlan Laboratories, Houston, 
TX) were housed under controlled light conditions and provided food 
and water ad libitum. Xenograft tumors were generated by subcutaneous 
injection of 1 × 106 BxPC3-GemR cells. Tumor volume was calculated using 
the formula: (π/6)(length × width × height). Once the average tumor size 
reached 50 mm3, animals were randomly divided into four groups with 10 
animals in each group: (1) control vehicle (PBS), (2) 100 mg curcumin/kg 
body weight daily, (3) 25 mg gemcitabine/kg body weight once every 4 days 
or (4) gemcitabine and curcumin together at the concentrations listed 
above. All treatments were injected intraperitoneally daily for 28 days, fol-
lowed by euthanasia. Tumor samples were dissected, weighed and stored 
in RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich) for further analysis. The animal protocol was 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Baylor 
Scott& White Research Institute, Dallas, Texas.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Ver.6.0 (GraphPad 
Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All data were expressed as mean ± SEM with 
statistical significance indicated when P < 0.05. Statistical comparisons 
were determined using unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s 
post hoc tests.
Results
Generation of gemcitabine-resistant BxPC3 cells
In order to select the appropriate cell lines in which to study drug 
resistance in pancreatic cancer, we evaluated the chemoresistance 
of various PDAC cell lines to gemcitabine, a first-line chemothera-
peutic drug used in PDAC. Among the three cell lines tested for 
changes in cellular proliferation using the MTT assay, BxPC3 cells 
were the most sensitive and Panc1 cells were the least sensitive 
to gemcitabine (Figure 1A). Therefore, we chose BxPC3 cells and 
Panc1 as models of inherently chemosensitive and chemoresist-
ant pancreatic cancer cell lines, respectively, for further analysis.
We then generated a chemoresistant cell line against gem-
citabine by culturing BxPC3 cells in media containing increasing 
concentrations of gemcitabine and then maintained them at 1 µM 
gemcitabine (Figure 1B). To confirm the acquired chemoresistance 
of these cells, we analyzed their viability at various gemcitabine 
concentrations compared to their parental counterparts. We 
found that BxPC3 cells continually cultured in gemcitabine were 
able to proliferate in higher concentrations of gemcitabine than 
the parental cell line (Figure 1C). Next, we compared clonogenic-
ity after treatment with gemcitabine between the two BxPC3 cell 
lines as well as the inherently gemcitabine-resistant Panc1 cells. 
The clonogenic ability of the gemcitabine-maintained cells was 
impacted significantly less by gemcitabine than were the parental 
cells or even the Panc1 cells (Supplementary Figure 1A, available 
at Carcinogenesis Online). This suggests that we had indeed estab-
lished a gemcitabine-resistant BxPC3 cell line. Hereafter, we will 
refer to this gemcitabine-resistant BxPC3 cell line as ‘BxPC3-GemR’ 
and use it as a model to study acquired gemcitabine resistance.
Curcumin sensitizes BxPC3-GemR cells to 
gemcitabine
We evaluated the effect of curcumin on the gemcitabine sensi-
tivity in BxPC3, BxPC3-GemR and Panc1 cell lines by determining 
changes in cellular proliferation after treatment with curcumin 
or gemcitabine alone, or in combination. Both gemcitabine and 
curcumin independently suppressed cell proliferation of paren-
tal BxPC3 cells, and the combination of the two compounds fur-
ther inhibited cell proliferation (Figure 1D). The Chou–Talalay CI 
(31) showed no synergism between curcumin and gemcitabine 
in parental BxPC3 cells (CI = 1.37), suggesting that the inhibi-
tory effects of curcumin and gemcitabine in the parental BxPC3 
cells were independent. In contrast, BxPC3-GemR cells appear 
to show resistance to gemcitabine, but not curcumin. However, 
combined treatment did further enhance cellular cytotoxicity. 
The CI indicated that gemcitabine and curcumin synergistically 
enhanced cytotoxicity in BxPC3-GemR cells (CI = 0.67; Figure 1D). 
On the other hand, both gemcitabine and curcumin inhibited 
cellular proliferation of Panc1 cells. Based on the Chou–Talalay 
CI, the combined treatment enhanced cellular cytotoxicity addi-
tively (Figure 1D).
Next, we performed a colony formation assay to examine the 
effects of curcumin and/or gemcitabine on cell proliferation and 
survival. In parental BxPC3 cells, treatment with either compound 
effectively inhibited formation of colonies in a dose-dependent 
manner, and the combination of the two compounds further 
inhibited the clonogenic capacity (Figure 1E). However, gemcit-
abine treatment alone did not attenuate the number of colonies 
in the gemcitabine-resistant cell line BxPC3-GemR at lower doses 
(Figure 1E). In contrast, curcumin treatment alone effectively sup-
pressed colony formation of BxPC3-GemR cells but not Panc1 cells 
(Figure 1E). Interestingly, the response to the combination of cur-
cumin and gemcitabine by BxPC3-GemR cells did not differ sig-
nificantly from that of curcumin treatment alone, indicating that 
curcumin plays a primary role in inhibiting colonization in these 
cancer cells (Figure 1E). Taken together, these results suggest that 
not only is curcumin cytotoxic to both types of BxPC3 cells but 
this natural compound also sensitizes gemcitabine-resistant cells 
to gemcitabine and suppresses cellular proliferation.
Curcumin induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in 
BxPC3-GemR cells
At the molecular level, gemcitabine suppresses cell prolifera-
tion by inhibiting DNA synthesis and inducing apoptosis (33,34). 
Therefore, we evaluated the effects of curcumin on gemcit-
abine-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We used the IC50 
concentrations of curcumin and gemcitabine obtained from our 
MTT assay results (Figure 1D) to establish treatment concentra-
tions of these compounds for each cell line. The concentrations 
were as follows: BxPC3 and BxPC3-GemR: 8 µM curcumin and 
20 nM gemcitabine; Panc1: 20 µM curcumin and 50 nM gemcit-
abine. Gemcitabine treatment alone did not induce apoptosis in 
BxPC3-GemR cells. However, consistent with the results of our 
MTT and colony formation assays, curcumin treatment alone 
as well as in combination with gemcitabine induced apoptosis 
in BxPC3-GemR cells (Figure 2A). The cell cycle analysis showed 
that both curcumin and gemcitabine induced G2/M phase arrest

in BxPC3-GemR cells, while the combination of curcumin and 
gemcitabine caused G2/M phase arrest in all three cell lines 
(Figure 2C). In addition, to confirm that curcumin inhibited 
cellular proliferation, we assessed the protein expression of a 
proliferative marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 
and a well-known cell cycle regulating tumor suppressor, p21.

Western blot analysis showed that curcumin, alone or in com-
bination with gemcitabine, suppressed the expression of PCNA, 
while up-regulating p21 (Figure 2B and D). These results are con-
sistent with a previous publication (34), which reported that cur-
cumin not only induces apoptosis but also modulates the cell 
cycle in human pancreatic cancer cells.
Curcumin inhibits PRC2 and lncRNA-PVT1 
expression
One of the theories as to why some PDACs become resist-
ant to chemotherapeutic drugs such as gemcitabine is that 
these tumors acquire a high portion of CSCs (5–8). PRC2 plays 
a key role in CSC maintenance through epigenetic regulation

of self-renewal-associated genes (8). This function of PRC2 has 
been reported in several cancer types, including pancreatic can-
cer cells, and two subunits of PRC2 (SUZ12 and EZH2) have been 
identified as the key oncogenes (5–8). Therefore, we investigated 
the effects of curcumin on the expression levels of these PRC2 
subunits. Western blot analysis showed that the protein expres-
sion of both SUZ12 and EZH2 was markedly down-regulated 
by curcumin treatment in all three cell lines, especially in the 
gemcitabine-resistant BxPC3-GemR and Panc1 cells (Figure 3A). 
These results suggest that curcumin regulates PRC2 activity by 
regulating the expression of its constituent proteins.
PRC2 has been reported to bind to several oncogenic lncR-
NAs, including PVT1, metastasis associated lung adenocarci-
noma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and HOX transcript antisense RNA 
(HOTAIR), to function as a repressive complex (15–17). Based on 
this, we investigated the expression of these PRC2-associated 
lncRNAs in the three cell lines and their possible regulation by 
curcumin. Our results showed that of the three lncRNAs, only 
the expression of PVT1 was significantly higher in BxPC3-GemR 
than in BxPC3, suggesting that PVT1 is involved in acquisition of 
chemoresistance (Figure 3B). All three lncRNAs were expressed 
at a significantly higher level in Panc1 cells than in the other two 
cell lines (Figure 3B). Interestingly, PVT1 was the only lncRNA 
significantly down-regulated by curcumin treatment in all three 
cell lines, while HOTAIR was down-regulated significantly in 
Panc1 cells only (Figure 3C).
One of the main mechanisms by which PVT1 induces chem-
oresistance and maintains cancer stemness is through a down-
stream effector, c-Myc (35,36,37). C-Myc is a well-recognized 
oncogene and one of the original genes used to derive induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (38). PVT1 has been identified 
as an enhancer of MYC and also acts as a stabilizer of c-Myc 
protein (39). Interestingly, curcumin treatment suppressed 
MYC expression in the parental BxPC3 and BxPC3-GemR cells 
(Supplementary Figure 2, available at Carcinogenesis Online). 
Taken together, these results suggest that curcumin sensitizes 
gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine by 
down-regulating the PRC2-PVT1-c-Myc axis.
Curcumin inhibits spheroid-derived cancer stem cell 
(SDCSC) formation
Since PRC2 and c-Myc are involved in the maintenance of can-
cer stemness, we generated spheroid-derived cancer stem cells 
(SDCSCs) from BxPC3 (Figure 4A). We evaluated the effects of 
curcumin on these cells. First, we confirmed that SDCSCs have 
a high stem cell population by assessing the expression of 
stemness markers Nanog, Oct4, CD44, CD133 and ALDH1 (40,41) 
in comparison to its parental cells. As expected, all stemness 
markers were significantly up-regulated in SDCSCs in compari-
son to BxPC3 cells, indicating that these spheroids are enriched 
in CSCs (Figure 4B). We then assessed the expression of Myc and 
found that it was also significantly up-regulated in spheroids 
compared to the parental cells (Figure 4C), as was the expression 
of PVT1. This up-regulation in SDCSCs indicates that PVT1 plays 
a key role in the maintenance of cancer stemness (Figure 4C). In 
addition, we assessed the expression of multi-drug resistance 1 
(MDR1) and found that it is expressed at higher levels in SDCSCs, 
indicating that these stem cells have higher drug resistance than 
their parental cell line (Figure 4C). We then assessed the expres-
sion of Myc and PVT1 in SDCSCs following curcumin treatment. 
Interestingly, the expression of both PVT1 and Myc was signifi-
cantly inhibited by curcumin treatment, restoring the expression 
levels almost to those seen in the parental cell line (Figure 4D). 
To determine whether curcumin treatment enhances sensitivity 
to chemotherapeutic agents, we investigated the expression of 
MDR1 in SDCSCs and found that curcumin treatment resulted in 
significant down-regulation of MDR1 (Figure 4D). Furthermore, 
western blot analysis showed that both PRC2 complex subunits, 
EZH2 and SUZ12, were significantly down-regulated in SDCSCs 
following curcumin treatment (Figure 4E).
Next, we tested whether curcumin impacts SDCSC forma-
tion by culturing BxPC3 cells in stem cell media with curcumin 
and/or gemcitabine. We found that curcumin treatment alone 
and in combination with gemcitabine significantly attenuated 
spheroid formation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4F). 
Collectively, these data show that curcumin specifically tar-
gets cancer stem cells by inhibiting the PRC2-PVT1-c-Myc axis, 
which was also consistent with our observation in the BxPC3-
GemR cell line. Hence, suppression of cancer stem cells appears 
to be one of the key mechanisms by which curcumin enhances 
gemcitabine sensitivity in chemoresistant PDAC.
Curcumin enhances sensitivity to gemcitabine in 
GemR cells in vivo
Finally, we evaluated the ability of curcumin to sensitize gem-
citabine-resistant tumors in a xenograft model. We generated 
chemoresistant xenograft tumors by injecting BxPC3-GemR 
cells into athymic nude mice and then treated them with 
intraperitoneal injections of curcumin and/or gemcitabine for 
28 days (Figure 5A). Based on tumor weight and volume the 
BxPC3-GemR-derived tumors showed high tolerance to gem-
citabine and proliferated regardless of gemcitabine treatment 
(Figure 5B and C). However, daily curcumin treatment signifi-
cantly suppressed tumor growth, and combined treatment 
with curcumin and gemcitabine further inhibited tumor prolif-
eration (Figure 5B and C). We then assessed the effect of these 
treatments on the expression of PVT1 in the xenograft tumors 
and found that combined curcumin and gemcitabine treatment 
downregulated the expression of PVT1, Myc and MDR1 in the 
xenograft tumors (Figure 5D and Supplementary Figure 3, avail-
able at Carcinogenesis Online). Collectively, these data support 
our in vitro findings that curcumin re-sensitizes gemcitabine-
resistant cancer cells to gemcitabine by attenuating PVT1 
(Figure 5E).
Discussion
The mechanisms by which pancreatic cancers acquire resist-
ance to chemotherapeutic agents are complex and poorly 
understood. There is accumulating evidence that PDAC is a CSC-
driven disease and that CSCs could be involved in the develop-
ment of chemoresistance that is seen in PDAC (5). Curcumin 
has been shown in several studies to be a promising sensitizer 
to chemotherapeutic agents, including gemcitabine, in cancer 
treatment. Considering that curcumin is a safe and cost-effec-
tive natural agent, it could have enormous clinical benefits 
(42,43). In this study, using a series of in vitro and in vivo experi-
ments, we showed that curcumin enhances chemosensitivity 
to gemcitabine by modulating the PRC2-PVT1-c-Myc axis in 
pancreatic cancer. We used gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic 
cancer cells to demonstrate that curcumin significantly alters 
cellular proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 
While BxPC3-GemR cell lines showed high tolerance to gemcit-
abine alone, combining it with curcumin was more effective at 
inhibiting their growth. In addition, curcumin inhibited forma-
tion of stem-cell-enriched spheroids and sensitized them to 
gemcitabine.

PRC2 is a key epigenetic mediator that maintains the CSC 
population by modulating several stemness-associated genes 
(8). EZH2 and SUZ12 are key subcomponents of PRC2 that are 
expressed at high levels in CSCs (21). PRC2 silences CDKN2A, 
E-cadherin and FOXC1 and suppresses differentiation by repress-
ing lineage-specifying factors such as ZBTB16, MX1 and FHL1 in

mesenchymal stem cells (44). Furthermore, nuclear accumula-
tion of EZH2 has been identified as a clinical marker of poorly 
differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and shRNA-based 
knock-down of EZH2 enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity in 
pancreatic cancer (45). Therefore, EZH2 appears to be a key 
regulatory factor that governs both cancer stemness and drug

resistance. Our study shows that by treating chemoresistant 
cells with curcumin we were able to attenuate the expression of 
EZH2 in gemcitabine-resistant cells.
Previous studies have demonstrated that PRC proteins such 
as EZH2 and SUZ12 interact with specific lncRNAs to enhance 
their oncogenic role in cancers. For example, HOTAIR was the 
first lncRNA to be identified to form a repressive complex with 
PRC2, which suppresses the expression of downstream targets 
through chromatin remodeling (46). Similarly, both MALAT1 
and PVT1 have been shown to interact with PRC2 in prostate 
cancer and thyroid cancer (15,16). Interestingly, PVT1 is located 
in the well-known cancer-related region 8q24, also known as 
the ‘gene desert’ (20). Mechanistically, PVT1 is known to par-
ticipate in DNA rearrangements, encode miRNAs and interact 
with c-Myc (20). Dysregulation of c-Myc is a common feature 
in cancer, and c-Myc is constitutively overexpressed in various

cancers (47). PVT1 has been identified as a key MYC enhancer 
and is involved in cell proliferation in a wide variety of cancers. 
PVT1 is also a key regulator in multi-drug resistance, including 
resistance against the plutinum-based drugs, docetaxel and 
gemcitabine (18,21,39,48–52). Using genome-wide screening, 
You et al. (18) identified PVT1 as a regulator of gemcitabine-
sensitivity in human pancreatic cancer cells. In line with these 
studies, we observed that the expression of PVT1 was higher in 
gemcitabine-resistant BxPC3-GemR and Panc1 cell lines than in 
the gemcitabine-sensitive BxPC3 parental cell line, affirming the 
involvement of PVT1 in resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic 
cancer. In addition, our data indicate that curcumin can sensi-
tize BxPC3-GemR and Panc1 cells to gemcitabine by simultane-
ously suppressing PVT1 and PRC2 expression. Considering that 
PVT1 affects Myc expression, curcumin is likely to attenuate 
PRC2-PVT1-c-Myc, which will induce sensitization to gemcit-
abine in chemoresistant cancers.
Interestingly, in the current study, the PRC2-PVT1-c-Myc 
axis appears to be involved in CSC formation. PVT1 expression 
was 4-fold higher in BxPC3 SDCSCs than in its parental cell line. 
MYC and MDR1, which are key genes known to enhance can-
cer stemness and the down-stream targets of PVT1, were also 
significantly up-regulated in the spheroids. These results sug-
gest that the mechanism of gemcitabine resistance in CSCs is 
consistent with those in gemcitabine chemoresistant cell lines. 
Moreover, our study demonstrated that the characteristics of 
acquired gemcitabine-resistant cells resembled those of pancre-
atic cancer stem-like cells. Collectively, these results highlight 
the possibility of using curcumin as a sensitizer to chemothera-
peutic drugs in chemoresistant PDACs in the clinical settings.
One of the limitations of the current study is that we did not 
show how curcumin alters the expression of PVT1 and PRC2. 
Considering that curcumin influences several signaling path-
ways, it is difficult to determine whether PVT1 was suppressed 
through inhibition of PRC2 or other independent mechanisms. 
Nevertheless, we demonstrated that curcumin was able to 
suppress a number of individual genes involved in the PRC2-
PVT1-c-Myc axis, making curcumin a unique compound that 
suppresses this critical signaling pathway. Currently, EZH2 is 
one of the most popular genes for a cancer therapeutic tar-
get. Several EZH2-specific inhibitors have already been devel-
oped and are currently being tested in human phase 1 trials 
(19). However, many of these drugs have shown relatively 
high toxicity in animal models (19). Although curcumin has 
been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years in 
India and Southeast Asia, it has only recently become a popu-
lar supplement in Western countries. We have demonstrated 
that curcumin was able to not only inhibit EZH2 but also its 
down-stream target PVT1 and ultimately c-Myc. Therefore, it is 
possible that botanicals such as curcumin could be used thera-
peutically as chemosensitizers to conventional chemothera-
peutic agents that cannot suppress cancer-stemness-inducing 
genes. Another limitation of our study is that we derived a 
gemcitabine resistant cell line from KRAS wild type cells; con-
sidering that most PDAC have mutations in KRAS it would be 
important to determine whether curcumin can re-sensitize 
KRAS mutant cells.
In summary, using a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, 
we have demonstrated that curcumin inhibits PRC2-PVT1-c-Myc, 
which enhances sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic 
agents by targeting CSCs. Our data is consistent with previous 
studies and highlights the potential of curcumin as a promising 
therapeutic agent in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, mechanistic 
investigation of natural compounds such as curcumin could 
result in the development of safer and more potent chemother-
apeutic agents. Further investigations including clinical trials 
are needed to confirm the efficacy of this compound as an adju-
vant to chemotherapeutic regimens.
