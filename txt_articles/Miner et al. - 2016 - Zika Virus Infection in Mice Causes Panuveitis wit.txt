In Brief
Miner et al. now describe how ZIKV
infection in the eye results in inflammation
and injury. ZIKV infected the iris, cornea,
retina, and optic nerve and caused
conjunctivitis, panuveitis, and
neuroretinitis in mice. This manuscript
establishes a model for evaluating
treatments for ZIKV infections in the eye.

SUMMARY
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus that causes
congenital abnormalities and Guillain-Barre
´
syn-
drome. ZIKV infection also results in severe eye dis-
ease characterized by optic neuritis, chorioretinal at-
rophy, and blindness in newborns and conjunctivitis
and uveitis in adults. We evaluated ZIKV infection of
the eye by using recently developed mouse models
of pathogenesis. ZIKV-inoculated mice developed
conjunctivitis,
panuveitis,
and
infection
of
the
cornea, iris, optic nerve, and ganglion and bipolar
cells in the retina. This phenotype was independent
of the entry receptors Axl or Mertk, given that Axl�/�,
Mertk�/�, and Axl�/�Mertk�/� double knockout mice
sustained levels of infection similar to those of con-
trol animals. We also detected abundant viral RNA
in tears, suggesting that virus might be secreted
from lacrimal glands or shed from the cornea. This
model provides a foundation for studying ZIKV-
induced ocular disease, defining mechanisms of viral
persistence, and developing therapeutic approaches
for viral infections of the eye.
INTRODUCTION
ZIKV is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that is closely related to
Dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses.
Beyond the clinical syndromes of microcephaly, intrauterine
growth restriction, and fetal demise, several clinical studies
have observed eye malformations and pathology in neonates
born to mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy (de Paula
Freitas et al., 2016; McCarthy, 2016; Miranda et al., 2016; Sarno
et al., 2016; Ventura et al., 2016a, 2016b). Manifestations of eye
disease in newborns with ZIKV include chorioretinal atrophy, op-
tic neuritis, bilateral iris colobomas, intraretinal hemorrhages,
lens subluxation, and blindness (de Paula Freitas et al., 2016;
Miranda et al., 2016; Ventura et al., 2016a, 2016b).
Viral infection in the eye can cause inflammation of uveal tis-
sues (retina, choroid, iris, and ciliary body), also termed uveitis,
which can lead to permanent vision loss if untreated (Niederkorn,
2006). In 2014, an Ebola virus (EBOV)-infected patient in the
convalescent phase presented with uveitis. The aqueous humor
of this patient’s eye contained persistent EBOV RNA well after
clearance of the virus in non-immune-privileged sites (Varkey
et al., 2015). A subsequent study identified 57 EBOV survivors
with uveitis, suggesting that infectious virus or viral RNA in the
eye might have triggered this complication (Tiffany et al.,
2016). Other animal models have suggested that some DNA vi-
ruses (e.g., ectromelia virus) might persist in the eye and recru-
desce after immunosuppression (Sakala et al., 2015). ZIKV
causes conjunctivitis in 10% to 15% of infected adults, and
uveitis occurred in a patient several weeks after initial infection.
Fluid sampled from the anterior chamber of this patient’s eye
contained viral RNA (Furtado et al., 2016), suggesting that
ZIKV can replicate within the eye at some stage of its clinical
syndrome.
ZIKV does not replicate efficiently in adult wild-type (WT) mice;
this phenotype might be explained by the ability of ZIKV to antag-
onize human but not mouse STAT2, which is activated by
signaling through the type I and type III interferon (IFN) receptors
(Ashour et al., 2009; Grant et al., 2016). Accordingly, we and
others have recently described models of ZIKV pathogenesis af-
ter congenital and adult infection in mice deficient in signaling

 through the type I IFN receptor (Aliota et al., 2016; Lazear et al.,
2016; Miner et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016). Mice lacking the type
I IFN receptor (Ifnar1�/� mice) developed neuroinvasive disease
after ZIKV infection, which caused death in younger animals,
although a fraction of older adult mice survived infection. Infec-
tion of Ifnar1�/� females with a French Polynesian strain of
ZIKV resulted in fetal demise and intrauterine growth restriction
in Ifnar1+/� fetuses (Miner et al., 2016), but ocular pathology
was not assessed.
Some flaviviruses are thought to attach to or enter target cells
by interacting with TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, or Mertk) via their
ligands, Gas6 and protein S, which bind to phosphatidylserine
displayed on the surface of the virion. In vitro studies have sug-
gested that TAM receptors can facilitate infection with WNV,
DENV, and ZIKV either by promoting binding (Hamel et al.,
2015; Meertens et al., 2012) or by activating TAM receptors
(Bhattacharyya et al., 2013), which negatively regulate signaling
through Ifnar1, resulting in a more permissive environment for
replication. Recent focus has been placed on ZIKV infection
and Axl, because it is expressed highly on neuroprogenitor cells
(Nowakowski et al., 2016) and subtypes of trophoblasts (Tabata
et al., 2016), which are key cellular targets of ZIKV.
Here, we evaluated whether ZIKV infects and injures the eyes
of mice. Although we did not detect eye pathology in congenitally
infected mice, ZIKV infected the iris, retina, and optic nerve of
adult mice and caused conjunctivitis, panuveitis, and neuroreti-
nitis without global photoreceptor abnormalities. Acute uveitis
was associated with high levels of ZIKV RNA and infectious virus
in the eye and detectable viral RNA in the tears and lacrimal
glands. ZIKV RNA persisted within the eye through the convales-
cent stage, while infectious virus was cleared within 28 days.
Although Axl and Mertk are expressed in eye tissues (Prasad
et al., 2006; Valverde et al., 2004), infection studies in Axl�/�
and Mertk�/� mice revealed no difference in ocular or brain infec-
tion, suggesting that these TAM receptors lack an essential entry
or signaling role in these tissues. Our experiments establish that
ZIKV infects specific target cells in different regions of the eye
and provide a model for the development and testing of treat-
ments for acute and persistent viral infections in the eye.
RESULTS
ZIKV Infection of the Eye with Viral RNA Shedding into
Tears
ZIKV does not replicate efficiently in WT C57BL/6 mice, in part
because ZIKV NS5 antagonizes human but not mouse STAT2
(Grant et al., 2016), which transmits signals downstream of
Ifnar1, a component of the type I IFN receptor. To overcome
this limitation, we treated mice with an anti-Ifnar1 blocking anti-
body (Lazear et al., 2016; Miner et al., 2016) and subcutaneously
inoculated them with low-passage ZIKV contemporary clinical
isolates, including strains from French Polynesia (H/PF/2013)
and Brazil (Paraı
´ba 2015). WT adult mice treated with anti-Ifnar1
monoclonal antibody (mAb) and inoculated with these ZIKV iso-
lates do not develop clinically apparent disease, although
viremia and infection of multiple organs occurs, including in im-
mune-privileged sites such as the testes (Lazear et al., 2016).
In comparison, Ifnar1�/� mice develop neuroinvasive infection,
causing some of these animals to succumb to infection (Aliota
et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016). In anti-Ifnar1
mAb-treated animals, we detected RNA of ZIKV H/PF/2013 or
Paraı
´ba 2015 in the eye at day 2 after infection, which increased
at day 6 (Figure 1A). Similar results were obtained after infection
of Ifnar1�/� mice with Paraı
´ba 2015, with high intraocular levels
of ZIKV RNA accumulating by day 7 (Figure 1B).
Given the data on persistence of eye infection in humans after
infection with EBOV and ZIKV (Furtado et al., 2016; Varkey et al.,
2015), we assessed infection in mice 28 days after inoculation.
Notably, ZIKV RNA persisted in several tissues, including the
eyes, brain, spleen, and other organs, long after the virus was
cleared from serum (Figure 1C and data not shown). During the
2015 EBOV epidemic, there was concern for person-to-person
spread through ocular secretions, including tears (Varkey et al.,
2015). As such, we next tested whether ZIKV RNA was present
in tear fluid after eye lavage of infected animals with 10 ml
of PBS. We detected ZIKV RNA in tear fluid (�3 3 102 focus-
forming units [FFUs] equivalents per mL) and in the lacrimal
gland (�2.4 3 103 FFU equivalents per mL) on day 7 after infec-
tion (Figures 1D and 1E), suggesting that infectious virus, viral
RNA, or ZIKV-infected cellular debris were present in ocular
secretions.
To determine whether ZIKV RNA in eyes (day 7 and day 28)
and tears (day 7) was infectious, we inoculated AG129 mice
via an intraperitoneal route with ocular homogenates or tear fluid;
these mice were utilized because they lack receptors for both
type I and II IFN signaling and are highly vulnerable to ZIKV infec-
tion even after inoculation with 1 plaque forming unit (PFU) (Aliota
et al., 2016), which we confirmed (data not shown). Inoculation
with eye homogenates obtained from Ifnar1�/� mice infected
with Paraı
´ba 2015 at day 7 resulted in death of AG129 mice,
which occurred uniformly by day 10 (Figure 2A). In contrast,
mice inoculated with eye homogenates from day 28 or tears
from day 7 did not develop signs of ZIKV infection (Figure 2A
and data not shown). These data suggest that infectious
virus was not produced in the eye after the acute phase of infec-
tion. We observed conjunctivitis in Ifnar1�/� mice infected with
ZIKV Paraı
´ba 2015, although this occurred in some but not all
animals (Figure 2B and data not shown). In the AG129 mice
inoculated with day 7 eye homogenates, we observed greater
ocular pathology, including severe conjunctivitis with extraocular
exudate in all animals, compared to milder disease in mice
receiving a similar dose of the parental ZIKV Paraı
´ba 2015 (Fig-
ures 2B and 2C).
Nonetheless, we observed similar titers in the spleen, brain,
and eyes of AG129 mice inoculated with either parental or eye-
derived virus (Figure 2D). We considered whether the severe
pathology seen with the eye-derived virus might be due to a virus
adaptation that enhances ocular tropism or injury. To evaluate
this hypothesis, we performed next-generation sequencing of
eye-, spleen-, and brain-derived virus from ZIKV-infected
Ifnar1�/� animals (Figure S1 and Table S1). Although we did
not identify any substitutions that were absent in the inoculating
virus, we observed a large increase in the frequency of a
single NS2A nucleotide mutation (C/T at genome position
3,895, from �10% to �80% in all biological replicates and in
all tissues tested) that resulted in an alanine to valine change.

 Axl and Mertk Are Not Required for ZIKV Infection of the
Eye and Brain In Vivo
The TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) are a family of recep-
tor tyrosine kinases whose ligands, Gas6 and protein S, bind to
phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells and envel-
oped viruses (Meertens et al., 2012). Because prior studies
have suggested that Axl might act as an attachment or entry re-
ceptor for ZIKV (Hamel et al., 2015; Nowakowski et al., 2016; Sa-
vidis et al., 2016) and TAM receptors are expressed in multiple
cell types in the eye (Prasad et al., 2006; Valverde et al., 2004),
we hypothesized Axl or its related TAM receptor, Mertk, might
be required for efficient ZIKV replication in ocular tissues. Unex-
pectedly, Axl�/�, Mertk�/�, and Axl�/�Mertk�/� double knockout
(DKO) mice that were treated with anti-Ifnar1 mAb exhibited
similar levels of ZIKV RNA in the serum, spleen, brain, and
eyes on day 6 after infection as compared to similarly treated
WT control animals (Figures 3A–3D). Thus, in mice deficient in
IFN signaling, Axl and Mertk are not required for ZIKV infection
in several tissues, including the eyes.
ZIKV Infects the Eyes and Brain of Young WT Mice
Congenital ZIKV infection in humans causes ocular pathology
including optic neuritis, retinal mottling, and chorioretinal atro-
phy (de Paula Freitas et al., 2016; Miranda et al., 2016; Ventura
et al., 2016a, 2016b). This could be a consequence of direct
eye infection or it might be due to secondary brain defects that
disrupt eye development. To test whether ocular pathology oc-

´ba 2015 at em-
bryonic day (E) 6.5 or E12.5 (equivalent to the late first and sec-
ond trimesters, respectively), we confirmed the presence of ZIKV
RNA in the heads of infected Ifnar1+/� fetuses 6 to 7 days later
(E13.5 and E18.5) by qRT-PCR (Figure 4A). As reported previ-
ously (Miner et al., 2016), substantive demise of Ifnar1+/� fetuses
was observed by E13.5 after ZIKV infection of Ifnar1�/� dams at
E6.5, which precluded analysis of fetal ocular tissues. However,
fetuses treated with an anti-Ifnar1 mAb survived ZIKV infec-
tion on E6.5 but did not show ocular abnormalities by histological
analysis (Figure 4B). When Ifnar1�/� dams were inoculated
later in gestation (E12.5), intrauterine growth restriction occurred
without fetal demise (Figure 4C). Again, no histologically
apparent
pathology
or
developmental
abnormality
was
observed at E18.5 in the eyes of Ifnar1+/� fetuses (Figure 4D).
Because we observed delayed clearance of ZIKV from the
eyes of adult mice (see Figure 1C), we tested for viral persistence
in the eyes of congenitally infected pups on postnatal day 8. After
testing five different experimental conditions, including infection
of anti-Ifnar1 mAb-treated pregnant WT mice at different gesta-
tional dates with ZIKV H/PF/2013 or Paraı
´ba 2015, we detected
viral RNA in eyes of only 2 of 41 congenitally infected animals
(Figure 4E). These results suggest that ZIKV might not infect
the eyes of fetuses efficiently in this model of in utero infection,
even though it crosses the placenta (Miner et al., 2016). In
contrast, postnatal infection of WT mice with ZIKV on day 8 after
3210

 birth caused a subset of animals to become moribund, and ZIKV
RNA was detected readily in the spleen, brain, and eyes 8 days
later (Figure 4F). These data establish that ZIKV infection of the
eye occurs in young mice even with intact type I IFN signaling.
Examination of the brains of these postnatally infected animals
revealed apoptosis (as detected by activated caspase-3 stain-
ing) in several CNS regions, including the optic tract, lateral
geniculate nucleus, and the visual cortex, all components of
the visual processing pathway (Figures 4G and 4H).
Anatomically, the eye is divided into the anterior (cornea, iris,
ciliary body, and lens) and posterior (vitreous, retina, retinal
pigment epithelium, choroid, and optic nerve) compartments,
each with specialized cells and functions (Figure 5A). We evalu-
ated the extent of eye injury in Ifnar1�/� or anti-Ifnar1 mAb-
treated adult animals infected with ZIKV. Histopathological anal-
ysis revealed TUNEL-positive cells in the neurosensory retina
(Figure 5B, white punctate staining). H&E staining showed ante-
rior uveitis with infiltration of inflammatory cells in the anterior
chamber (Figure 5C, upper right panel). The posterior eye also
exhibited evidence of uveitis with inflammatory cell infiltration,
exudate, and debris in the vitreous humor (Figure 5C, lower right
panel). We next assessed the fundus of the eye for gross
structural damage by using biomicroscopic and fundoscopic ex-
amination; no differences were observed between mock- and
ZIKV-infected Ifnar1�/� or anti-Ifnar1 mAb-treated mice on day
7 (Figure S2 and data not shown). These experiments suggest
that ZIKV infection does not induce significant pan-retinal abnor-
malities. Fluorescein angiography in ZIKV-infected Ifnar1�/�
mice also revealed no evidence of vascular leakage or intra-
retinal hemorrhages (Figure S2). Thus, ZIKV infection in adult
mice causes panuveitis without major structural damage or ef-
fects on vascular permeability.

 To determine whether ZIKV infection of the eye caused func-
tional deficits, we performed ex vivo electroretinography (ERG),
which measures the transmission of light by photoreceptor cells.
ERG testing of dissected eyes from Ifnar1�/� mice on day 7 after
ZIKV infection revealed no apparent defects in photoreceptor
function (Figures S3A– S3D). Similar results were obtained on
days 7, 14, and 28 in ZIKV-infected WT mice treated with anti-If-
nar1 mAb (Figures S3E–S3H and data not shown). Thus, ZIKV
infection and persistence in the eye does not cause global photo-
receptor dysfunction. This ERG evaluation, however, does not
rule out mild or focal defects in photoreceptor function or whether
neuronal dysfunction of the inner retina and damage to the optic
nerve, optic tract, or visual cortex occurs, any of which could
result in blindness or selective visual field defects.
We evaluated the cellular tropism of ZIKV in the eye. Initially, we
performed microdissection and measured ZIKV RNA levels in
different compartments of the eye on day 7 after infection (Fig-
ure 6A). We included analysis of the anterior (cornea, iris, and
lens) and posterior (neurosensory retina, retinal pigment epithe-
lium/choroid complex,andoptic nerve)chambers (see Figure 3B).
ZIKV RNA was detected in all eye regions, with �100-fold higher
levels in the retinal pigment epithelium/choroid complex than
in the optic nerve (p < 0.05, Figure 6A). To confirm these findings,
eyes were collected at 6 to 8 days after inoculation and assessed
for viral RNA by in situ hybridization (ISH). Mock-infected
animals stained for ZIKV RNA and infected animals stained with
a negative control probe against a bacterial gene had no staining
in the cornea, optic nerve, or retina (Figure 6B and data not

DISCUSSION
Understanding
the
consequences
of
ocular infection by viruses has become
of greater concern because of the potential implications related
to viral persistence and spread. Case reports of human patients
infected with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), EBOV, ZIKV, and
WNV suggest that some viruses have the capacity to cause sig-
nificant acute ocular pathology, including uveitis and keratitis
(Chong et al., 2004; Furtado et al., 2016; Kuchtey et al., 2003;
Varkey et al., 2015). Since ZIKV does not efficiently infect WT
mice, we tested whether it targets the eyes of mice by using a
published model of ZIKV pathogenesis in adult animals deficient
in type I IFN immunity as well as in immunocompetent neonatal
mice and fetuses. Although we did not observe evidence of
congenital ocular disease, which has been described in humans
(de Paula Freitas et al., 2016; McCarthy, 2016; Ventura et al.,
2016a, 2016b), ZIKV infected the eye and caused conjunctivitis
and severe uveitis in immunodeficient adult mice. RNA ISH and
virological analysis revealed that ZIKV infects the cornea, vas-
cularized choroid, bipolar and ganglion layers of the retina,
and optic nerve. Although the mechanism by which ZIKV
causes eye disease remains undefined, our studies provide an
animal model that can be used to define host factors that
restrict pathogenesis and test candidate antiviral therapies
directly within the eye.
The most common form of ZIKV-induced ocular disease is
conjunctivitis, which occurs in 10% to 15% of patients, but
whether conjunctivitis is a direct consequence of ZIKV infection
of the eye is not known. In contrast, ZIKV-induced uveitis is less
common, although it has been described in humans (Furtado
et al., 2016). How ZIKV triggers uveitis remains uncertain,

 although inflammatory cell recruitment might contribute to this,
according to our histological findings. Direct infection of the
eye might cause inflammation as a consequence of virus-
induced cell death, cytokine production, and/or leukocyte
recruitment. Alternatively, intracellular or extracellular viral RNA
can act as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)
and activate inflammatory responses via stimulating pattern
recognition receptors (e.g., Toll-like or Rig-I-like receptors),
even in the absence of infectious virus. In humans with EBOV-
and ZIKV-induced uveitis, viral RNA was detectable within the
intraocular fluid. We found that mice infected with ZIKV had no
infectious virus in the eye by day 28, even though high levels of
ZIKV RNA were present. Consistent with this observation, there
is extensive literature describing WNV-induced ocular disease in
humans, including uveitis, chorioretinitis, and retinal artery oc-
clusion (Hershberger et al., 2003; Kaiser et al., 2003; Kuchtey
et al., 2003). Neurotropic flaviviruses might first invade the brain,
then infect the optic tract, and later transit in a retrograde direc-
tion into the eye along the optic nerve. Alternatively, ocular infec-
tion might result from hematogenous spread of virus across the
blood-retinal barrier. Additional studies are needed to define the
precise mechanisms of ocular invasion by ZIKV.
ZIKV infects both the eyes and testes in humans and in animal
models (Lazear et al., 2016; Musso et al., 2015), suggesting that
immune-privileged organs might support replication even weeks
after resolution of viremia and clinical symptoms. Hepatitis C vi-
rus, a related Flaviviridae family member, can infect the human
cornea (Lee et al., 2001) and is transmitted by corneal

 transplantation (Tugwell et al., 2005). Given that ZIKV has capac-
ity to infect the cornea of mice, human studies might be needed
to confirm whether ZIKV analogously infects the human cornea.
If corneal infection by ZIKV were established in humans, then
widespread ocular infection during epidemics could necessitate
testing by eye banks to ensure that ZIKV is not present in the
corneas of infected donors.
Congenital ocular disease caused by ZIKV might be due to
direct targeting of cells in the fetal eye. Alternatively, it could
occur as part of a neurodevelopmental defect, which is seen in
microcephaly cases even in the absence of an infectious cause
(Derbent et al., 2004). Although a recent study suggested ocular
pathology was present in SJL mouse pups that were infected
with ZIKV in utero, histological characterization of their eyes
was not demonstrated (Cugola et al., 2016). We did not observe
histological abnormalities of the eyes of congenitally infected
Ifnar1+/� fetuses from C57BL/6 Ifnar1�/� dams. Studies with
other mouse and non-human primate models are needed to
clarify the requirements and basis for ZIKV-induced congenital
ocular disease.
TAM receptors might enhance attachment and entry of flavivi-
ruses, including ZIKV (Hamel et al., 2015; Meertens et al., 2012;
Savidis et al., 2016). This hypothesis has been strengthened
by a correlation between levels of Axl expression and vulnera-
bility of certain neuronal subtypes to ZIKV infection (Nowakowski
et al., 2016). However, our studies in Axl�/�, Mertk�/�, and
Axl�/�Mertk�/� mice revealed no effect of a loss of expression
of these TAM receptors on ZIKV replication, suggesting that
Axl and Mertk are not required for CNS or ocular infection in
mice. These results are analogous to prior studies with WNV,
in which an absence of Axl and/or Mertk paradoxically resulted
in enhanced infection in the brain, which was due in part to

 alterations in the permeability of endothelial cells lining the
blood-brain barrier (Miner et al., 2015). Our data do not exclude
the possibility that Axl might still act as an entry factor for ZIKV in
specific cells in other tissue compartments (e.g., trophoblasts in
the placenta or subsets of neurons in the CNS).
In summary, we have described a mouse model of ocular
disease that demonstrates ZIKV tropism in specific regions of
the eye, panuveitis, shedding of viral RNA into tears, and
persistence in immunodeficient adult mice. We have also
confirmed that ZIKV infects the eye of immunocompetent
neonatal WT mice. Studies are planned to define the cellular
mechanisms by which ZIKV invades and infects the eye and
results in inflammation. Further analysis of the host and
virus factors that facilitate ocular infection and mechanisms of
immune-mediated clearance could lead to interventions that
enhance elimination of viruses from immune-privileged sites,
including the eye.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics Statement
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH. The protocols
were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the
Washington University School of Medicine (assurance number A3381-01).
Inoculations were performed under anesthesia induced and maintained with
ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts were made to minimize
animal suffering.
Viruses and Titration
The ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (French Polynesia, 2013) was provided by the
Arbovirus Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with
permission (X. de Lamballerie, Aix Marseille Universite
´ ) (Baronti et al., 2014).
The ZIKV strain Paraı
´ba 2015 (Brazil, 2015) was provided by Steve Whitehead
(NIH). ZIKV stocks were propagated in Vero cells and titrated by focus-forming
assay (FFA) as previously described (Lazear et al., 2016; Miner et al., 2016).
Mouse Experiments
Ifnar1�/� mice (Hwang et al., 1995) were backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 back-
ground. Axl�/�, Mertk�/�, and Axl�/�Mertk�/� mice have been published (Lu
and Lemke, 2001) and were backcrossed for ten generations. Mice were
bred in a specific-pathogen-free facility at Washington University or purchased
(WT animals) from Jackson Laboratories. In some experiments, WT mice were
treated with 2 mg of an anti-Ifnar1 blocking mouse mAb (MAR1-5A3) or isotype
control mouse mAb (GIR-208; Leinco Technologies) (Sheehan et al., 2006,
2015) by intraperitoneal injection prior to infection with ZIKV. 4- to 8-week-
old mice were inoculated with ZIKV by subcutaneous (footpad) route with
103 FFU in 50 mL of PBS. Mice were sacrificed at day 2, 6, 7, 8, or 28, depend-
ing on the experimental design, and organs were harvested. To study congen-
ital infection, anti-Ifnar1 mAb-treated WT pregnant mice were infected with the
indicated strains of ZIKV at E6.5, E9.5, E12.5, or E15.5, and tissues were har-
vested at postnatal day 8. For some experiments, pregnant Ifnar1�/� females
carrying Ifnar1+/� fetuses were infected on E12.5. Ifnar1+/� fetal tissues were
harvested on E18.5 as previously described (Miner et al., 2016). For studies
in neonatal WT animals, mice were inoculated subcutaneously on postnatal
day 7 or 8 and then tissues were harvested 6 days later and analyzed for
the presence of viral RNA. For comparison of parental (Paraı
´ba 2015) and
mouse-passaged ZIKV, AG129 mice (van den Broek et al., 1995) were inocu-
lated via an intraperitoneal route with 104 FFU of parental ZIKV or an equivalent
dose (based on viral RNA) from eye homogenates collected from Ifnar1�/�
mice on day 7 or day 28 after ZIKV infection. Alternatively, AG129 mice
were inoculated via an intraperitoneal route with 10 mL of tears (diluted in
150 mL of PBS) collected from Ifnar1�/� mice on day 7 after infection with
ZIKV (Paraı
´ba 2015).
Measurement of Viral Burden
Tissues were weighed and homogenized with zirconia beads in a MagNA
Lyser instrument (Roche Life Science) in 250 mL or 500 mL of PBS. Tissue
samples and serum from ZIKV-infected mice were extracted with the RNeasy
Mini Kit (tissues) or the Viral RNA Mini Kit (serum) (QIAGEN). ZIKV RNA levels
were determined by one-step qRT-PCR on an ABI 7500 Fast Instrument
using standard cycling conditions. Viral burden was expressed on a log10
scale as viral RNA equivalents per gram or per mL after comparison with a
standard curve produced using serial 10-fold dilutions of ZIKV RNA. A pub-
lished primer set was used to detect ZIKV RNA (Lanciotti et al., 2008; Miner
et al., 2016).
Tears and Lacrimal Gland Collection
ZIKV-infected mice were euthanized on day 7 after infection. Tear fluid from
both eyes was collected after gentle lavage with 10 mL of PBS using FP plus
multiflex tips (Fisher Scientific). Intact lacrimal gland lobules were isolated by
dissection.
TUNEL Staining
Cell death in the neurosensory retina of Ifnar1�/� mice was assessed 7 days
after ZIKV infection by TUNEL staining. In brief, paraffin sections of eyes
from ZIKV-infected mice were pretreated with proteinase K and stained with
an ApopTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Images of the retina were collected and
merged into a composite image.
Brain Sectioning and Immunostaining for Activated Caspase-3
After ZIKV infection, animals were anesthetized and perfused via intracardiac
injection with 4% paraformaldehyde in Tris-HCl buffer. Brains were then
sectioned at 70 mm with a vibratome and stained for activated caspase-3 as
described previously (Miner et al., 2016).
RNA ISH
RNA ISH was performed with an RNAscope 2.5 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized by incubation for 60 min at
60�C. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with hydrogen peroxide for
10 min at room temperature. Slides were then boiled for 15 min in RNAscope
Target Retrieval Reagents and incubated for 30 min in RNAscope Protease
Plus before probe hybridization. The probe targeting ZIKV RNA was designed
and synthesized by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (catalog no. 467771). Positive
(targeting plr2a gene) and negative (targeting bacterial gene dapB) control
probes also were obtained from Advanced Cell Diagnostics (312471 and
310043, respectively). Tissues were counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin
and visualized with standard bright-field microscopy.
Data Analysis
All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. For viral burden
analysis, the log10 transformed titers and levels of viral RNA were analyzed
by the Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA. A p value
of < 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences.
