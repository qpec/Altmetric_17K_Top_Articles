Measuring progress and projecting attainment on the 
basis of past trends of the health-related Sustainable 
Development Goals in 188 countries: an analysis from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 SDG Collaborators*
Summary
Background The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the global ambition of “leaving no 
one behind”. Understanding today’s gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as 
they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990–2016 for 
188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030.
Methods We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an 
increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, 
which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for 
several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0–100, with 0 as the 2·5th percentile 
estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97·5th percentile during that time. An index representing all 
37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the 
basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and 
country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on 
out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against 
which we assessed attainment.
Findings Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56·7 (IQR 31·9–66·8) in 2016 and country-level 
performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86·8, 95% uncertainty interval 84·6–88·9), Iceland (86·0, 
84·1–87·6), and Sweden (85·6, 81·8–87·8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10·9, 9·6–11·9), the 
Central African Republic (11·0, 8·8–13·8), and Somalia (11·3, 9·5–13·1) recording the lowest. Between 2000 
and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, 
Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the 
Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on 
projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2–8) of the 24 defined 
targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging 
from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal 
mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, 
including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related 
SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved 
in the past.
Interpretation GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in 
terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health 
services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting 
defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of 
SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic 
effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs’ broader, bolder development 
agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all 
populations.

Introduction
“Leaving no one behind” is the cornerstone of the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the international 
development agenda formally adopted by the UN and its 
member states in September, 2015.1 To deliver on this 
aim, it is essential to measure where advances have 
been achieved—and where challenges or new threats are 
occurring—through 
routinely 
updated, 
comparable 
monitoring and evaluation.2,3 After the SDGs’s adoption, 
debate continued around the SDG indicator framework, 
imple 
mentation, and monitoring,4 which ultimately led to 
an open call for revision proposals overseen by the Inter-
Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development 
Goal Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) in 2016. In March, 2017, the 
UN Statistical Commission agreed on several indicator 
revisions and established formal mechanisms for ongoing 
indicator refinement and additions.5 At this time, 
232 individual SDG indicators are included in the global 
SDG indicator framework,5 aligned with the original 
17 goals and 169 targets. 50 health-related indicators 
(ie, indicators that directly involve health services, health 
outcomes, and risk factors with well established causal 
connections to health) exist within 29 health-related targets 
and 11 goals, including SDG 3, which aims to “ensure 
healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages”.
As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015),6 we generated a 
baseline assessment for 33 health-related SDG indicators, 
producing an overall summary indicator (the health-
related SDG index), and examined historical trends for 
the overall index and individual indicators for 
188 countries from 1990 to 2015. Other efforts have also 
sought to measure the health-related SDGs across 
countries, including assessments by the WHO,7,8 the 
Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN),9,10 
and the World Bank;11 however, they experience 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Since the establishment of the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) in September, 2015, an increasing number of global 
efforts have sought to measure levels and progress in achieving 
the health-related SDGs. International agencies such as WHO 
currently report on a subset of the 50 health-related SDG 
indicators, but inconsistencies in the years reported and 
countries represented for each SDG indicator provide an 
incomplete understanding of health priorities in the SDG era. 
Drawing on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we measured 33 health-related 
indicators and an overall health-related SDG index for 
188 countries from 1990 to 2015. A number of indicators were 
not included in this baseline assessment, and some indicators 
such as universal health coverage (UHC; SDG indicator 3.8.1) 
had substantial measurement limitations. Demand for initial 
projections of SDG achievement in 2030, based on past trends, 
has increased as national and global institutions alike aim to 
solidify actionable strategies and concrete policy agendas. To 
date, however, no studies have produced projections across 
health-related SDG indicators and locations.
Added value of this study
Based on work by more than 2500 collaborators from more 
than 135 countries and territories, GBD 2016 provides an 
independent and systematic assessment of 37 of the 
50 health-related indicators. This represents an increase of 
four indicators since GBD 2015: vaccine coverage for targeted 
populations by vaccines in national programmes 
(SDG indicator 3.b.1); two violence indicators (prevalence of 
physical or sexual violence [SDG indicator 16.1.3] and 
childhood sexual abuse [SDG indicator 16.2.3]); and well-
certified death registration (SDG indicator 17.19.2c). For the 
UHC index (SDG indicator 3.8.1), to better represent a full 
range of essential health services, we combined 
risk-standardised mortality rates from 32 causes from which 
death should not occur in the presence of high-quality health 
care with estimates of nine types of intervention coverage for 
infectious diseases and maternal and child health outcomes. 
Based on past trends measured from 1990 to 2016, this study 
provides projections of each health-related indicator 
through 2030 and an assessment of attainment against 
defined SDG targets.
Implications of all available evidence
Country-level performance for the health-related SDG index 
varied greatly in 2016, emphasising health inequalities by 
location and levels of sociodemographic development. 
Our improved measure of UHC showed a divide across the 
sociodemographic spectrum, which might be associated with 
major differences in access to high-quality health services 
focused on non-communicable diseases and complex 
conditions in higher-income countries. Nonetheless, 
considerable progress occurred for many countries on the UHC 
index between 2000 and 2016, especially in Cambodia, 
Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China. Based on 
projections of past trends, meeting a subset of established SDG 
targets by 2030 might be possible for some areas of the world, 
with more than 60% of countries projected to meet targets on 
under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, 
and malaria. At the same time, on the basis of past trends, 
much of western and central sub-Saharan Africa was projected 
to attain very few—if any—defined targets in 2030. 
Furthermore, at current rates of progress, fewer than 5% of 
countries were projected to reach 2030 targets for 
11 indicators, including childhood overweight, tuberculosis, 
and road injury mortality. Translation of the global SDG 
framework into investments and policy remains in its infancy, 
offering decision makers the opportunity to address both 
long-standing and emerging health challenges in the SDG era.

limitations in terms of the years covered and countries 
included for each indicator. By contrast, the GBD study 
uses highly standardised analytical approaches to 
produce comprehensive and comparable estimates 
across countries and over time. A collaboration of more 
than 2500 global health researchers and experts from 
more than 135 countries and territories enables GBD to 
incorporate the latest data, reflect regional and local 
knowledge, and to facilitate policy translation at local 
levels. Additionally, established mechanisms, including a 
Scientific 
Council 
and 
Independent 
Advisory 
Committee,12 ensure scientific rigour and independence 
from undue political influence.
A key component of the health-related SDGs is universal 
health coverage (UHC).13–18 SDG target 3.8 explicitly 
highlights the importance of UHC, aiming to “achieve 
universal health coverage, including financial risk 
protection, access to quality essential health-care services 
and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable 
essential medicines and vaccines for all”.5 SDG 
indicator 3.8.1 focuses on coverage of essential health 
services, capturing the role of health systems in delivering 
effective interventions to improve a wide range of health 
outcomes. On the basis of GBD 2015 results, we developed 
a proxy measure of UHC based on the coverage of 
maternal, child, and selected communicable disease 
interventions.6 WHO has proposed a similar proxy UHC 
measure,7,19 although the WHO UHC indicator also seeks 
to incorporate the absence of selected risk factors at the 
population level (eg, blood pressure, cholesterol, and 
smoking). However, measures of risk exposure might not 
optimally capture access to high-quality health care or 
broader health system functioning; rather, they might 
represent 
behavioural, 
cultural, 
or 
environmental 
determinants (eg, diet, air pollution) that are less directly 
addressed by health systems. Consid 
erable opportunity 
exists to improve current UHC measures by combining 
more traditional measures of intervention coverage with 
analyses of amenable mortality, such as those used in the 
Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index;20 this would 
allow the incorporation of a broader set of health services 
as well as reflect both access to and quality of care.
Understanding of how past rates of progress translate 
into future trajectories for the SDGs is an important input 
for decision makers, particularly during these initial years 
of SDG policy development and imple 
mentation. Health-
related SDG targets and their corresponding indicators 
represent a substantially broader range of health needs 
than those represented in the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs), which primarily concentrated on maternal 
and child health outcomes and infectious diseases;21 
furthermore, the SDGs are meant to apply to all countries, 
irrespective of their development status, whereas the 
MDGs were viewed as lower priority or less applicable to 
higher-income countries. Subsequently, it is crucial to 
know where—and how much—progress needs to be 
accelerated during the next years of SDG implementation 
to reach stated targets. Selected studies have generated 
projections based on past trends, but have generally 
been restricted to specific SDG indicators (eg, under-5 
mortality,22 maternal mortality,23 non-communicable dis-
ease [NCD] mortality,24 and met need for family planning25) 
or focused on individual countries and indicators 
(eg, premature mortality from NCDs in Mexico26 and child 
mortality in India27). A comprehensive assessment of how 
past progress could translate into SDG performance 
in 2030 across health-related indicators is essential to help 
global, regional, and national decision makers identify the 
countries and areas of greatest need and align current and 
future investment plans accordingly.
In this study, we provide updated estimates from 1990 
to 2016 for each health-related SDG indicator and the 
overall health-related SDG index. In doing so, we also 
improve the measurement for several indicators, most 
notably the UHC index (SDG indicator 3.8.1) by 
incorporating components of the HAQ Index. We also 
include four additional health-related indicators since 
GBD 2015: vaccine coverage for targeted populations by 
vaccines in national programmes (SDG indicator 3.b.1), 
two violence indicators (prevalence of physical or sexual 
violence [SDG indicator 16.1.3] and childhood sexual 
abuse [SDG indicator 16.2.3]), and well-certified death 
registration (SDG indicator 17
.19.2c). Based on past 
trends, we produce indicator-by-indicator projections for 
188 countries from 2017 to 2030. It is important to note 
that these projections are not intended to predict what 
progress would be achieved as a result of the SDGs; 
instead, these projections are meant to shed light on 
potential gaps and gains on the health-related SDGs 
by 2030, and where countries are likely to be, based on 
past progress, in relation to defined SDG targets.
Methods
Overview of GBD
This analysis of the health-related SDGs is based on the 
GBD study, which measures the health of populations on 
an annual basis. GBD produces age-specific, sex-specific, 
and country-specific estimates (including selected sub-
national units) of cause-specific mortality and mor 
bidity, 
risk factor exposure, mortality and morbidity attrib 
utable 
to these risks, and a range of health system characteristics, 
from 1990 to the most recent year. Various summary 
measures are computed, including disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy. GBD uses 
highly standardised and validated approaches applied to 
all available data sources adjusted for major sources of 
bias. Further details on GBD 2016, which covers 
1990–2016, are available elsewhere.28–32
As with all revisions of the GBD study, GBD 2016 
provides an update of the full time series from 1990–2016 
based on methodological improvements and newly 
identified data sources; subsequently, the full time series 
on the health-related SDGs published here as part of 
GBD 2016 supersedes previous GBD studies. The

GBD 2016 study and this analysis comply with the 
Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting (GATHER).33 Further detail on the 
estimation and data sources used for all indicators are 
available in appendix 1.
Indicators, definitions, and measurement approach
In this updated analysis we cover 37 of 50 health-related 
SDG indicators (table). Additional details on data and 
methods for estimating each indicator are in appendix 1. 
Appendix 2 outlines the 13 indicators not presently 
measured (pp 10–12). The addition of new causes, risks, 
and health indicators are considered by the GBD Scientific 
Council for each annual cycle of the GBD. For GBD 2016, 
four health-related SDG indicators were added: vaccine 
coverage (SDG indi 
cator 3.b.1); two violence indicators 
(prevalence of physical or sexual violence [SDG 
indi 
cator 16.1.3] and childhood sexual abuse [SDG 
indi 
cator 16.2.3]); and well-certified death registration 
(SDG indi 
cator 17
.19.2c).
Vaccine coverage (SDG indi 
cator 3.b.1), defined as 
“proportion of the target population covered by all 
vaccines included in their national programme”, became 
a separate indicator as part of the March, 2017, revision to 
the SDG framework.5 We report on this indicator by using 
the geometric mean of the coverage of three-dose 
diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT3); three-dose 
polio; first-dose measles vaccine; and for countries where 
the vaccine(s) are included in the national schedule: 
BCG vaccine, three-dose pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV3), three-dose Haemophilus influenzae type b 
vaccine (Hib3), three-dose hepatitis B vaccine (delivered 
as part of pentavalent vaccines), and two-dose or three-
dose rotavirus vaccine. To account for the scale-up period 
for newly introduced vaccines, we include new vaccines 
in the geometric mean only 3 years after the introduction 
year in each country.
We also added two violence indicators in GBD 2016: age-
standardised prevalence of physical or sexual violence 
experienced by populations in the last 12 months (SDG 
indi 
cator 16.1.3) and age-standardised prevalence of 
women and men aged 18–29 years who experienced sexual 
violence by age 18 years (SDG indi 
cator 16.2.3). The UN 
definition for SDG indi 
cator 16.1.3 includes psychological 
violence, but due to limited data availability and highly 
variable definitions of self-reported psychological violence, 
we restricted this measurement to physical and sexual 
violence.
As part of GBD 2016, we developed a data quality measure 
to reflect the proportion of well-certified deaths by a vital 
registration (VR) system among a country’s total population, 
which corresponds with the third comp 
onent of 17
.19.2 
(referred to as SDG indicator 17
.19.2c). Well-certified deaths 
were determined by three measures: (1) completeness of 
death registration; (2) fraction of deaths not assigned to 
major garbage codes (ie, causes that cannot or should not 
be underlying causes of death); and (3) fraction of deaths 
assigned to detailed GBD causes. More detail on this 
measure can be found elsewhere 29 and in appendix 1.
We also refined the measurement of several 
previously included health-related indicators. First, SDG 
indi 
cator 16.1.2 (conflict mortality) now exclusively 
focuses on deaths due to conflict and terrorism. Second, 
we revised the exposure period from lifetime to 
12 months for SDG indicator 5.2.1 (intimate partner 
violence) to match the UN SDG definition. Third, we 
limited our measurement of SDG indicator 6.2.1b 
(hygiene) to access to a handwashing facility, which also 
aligns more directly with the UN SDG target. Fourth, we 
extended the measurement of SDG indicator 3.8.1 
(coverage of essential health services, or UHC tracer 
interventions) to include the individual components of 
the HAQ Index,20 which is based on risk-standardised 
death rates from 32 causes amenable to personal health 
care.34,35 This revised approach expands the range of 
potential health services, particularly those for NCDs, 
captured by this summary measure. The previous UHC 
tracer indicator included only maternal and child health 
and selected infectious disease inter 
ventions (malaria, 
HIV, and tuberculosis).6 Last, a subset of indicators have 
undergone substantial revision due to data improve-
ments, methodological improvements, or both, imple-
mented in GBD 2016, including alcohol consumption 
and child growth failure (ie, under-5 stunting and 
wasting). Further detail on these updates can be found in 
appendix 1, as well as accompanying GBD 2016 papers.28–32
Projection of health-related SDG indicators to 2030
We projected the health-related SDG indicators on the 
basis of past trends. We first calculated for each location 
the annual rate of change between 1990 and 2016 for 
each individual year in natural-log space or, for indicators 
bounded between 0 and 1 (eg, intervention coverage, 
percentage of population) in logit-space. We then 
calculated the weighted median annualised rate of 
change for each country using the following weighting 
function: 
The value of ω denotes how much weight is given to 
recent years compared with past years when calculating 
the median annualised rate of change. To determine the 
appropriate value of ω for each SDG indicator, we did an 
out-of-sample predictive validity test in which we held 
out data for all countries from 2008 to 2016 and predicted 
values for this time period using the data from 
1990 to 2007
. We tested values of ω ranging from 0 to 2 in 
increments of 0·2 and chose the indicator-specific value 
of ω that minimised the root mean squared error (RMSE) 
in the held out data (2008–16). This was used to project 
each indicator to 2030. Appendix 1 provides the indicator 
specific values of ω used and further details on methods.

For HIV, we used an alternative approach. In many 
countries, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, through 
large internal investments, substantial development 
assistance via programmes such as the President’s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR),36 and 
reductions in drug prices, has been scaled up considerably. 
If past trends are used to project future coverage, many 
countries would be projected to achieve 100% coverage 
by 2030. This ignores health system constraints in scaling 
up ART. For ART coverage, our projections were a 
function of projected ART price based on data from the 
Global Price Reporting Mechanism (GPRM),37 projected 
government health expenditure as source,38 and projected 
development assistance for health (DAH) for HIV or 
AIDS.38 We bounded ART projections with an ART 
coverage frontier produced on the basis of income per 
capita to reflect health system constraints. We then used 
projected ART coverage to project HIV incidence hazard 
and HIV incidence using Spectrum.39 Further detail on 
this method is in appendix 1.

and health-related non-MDG indices
As in GBD 2015, we developed an overall health-related

For this indicator, we include three categories of alcohol

capita does not capture the distribution of use. The SEV 
for alcohol use is based on two primary dimensions: 
individual-level drinking (current drinkers and lifetime 
abstainers, and alcohol consumption by age and sex) 
and population-level consumption (L per capita of pure 
alcohol stock). The SEV then weights these categories 
with their corresponding relative risks, which translate 
to risk-weighted prevalences on a scale of 0% (no risk in 
the population) to 100% (the entire population 
experiences maximum risk associated with alcohol 
consumption).

or inactivated polio vaccine); met need for modern 
contraception; antenatal care coverage (one or more visits 
and four or more visits); skilled birth attendence coverage; 
in-facility delivery rates; and coverage of antiretroviral 
therapy among people living with HIV. The 32 causes 
amenable to personal health care, which compose the 
HAQ Index, included tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, 
lower respiratory infections, upper respiratory infections, 
diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, measles, maternal 
disorders, neonatal disorders, colon and rectum cancer,

states and thus assume that each SDG target should be 
treated equally.
To combine indicators, we first transformed each 
indicator on a scale from 0 to 100. Scaling indicator 
values in this way allows comparisons to be made on the 
relative performance on very different SDG indicators 
and allows us to produce an overall health-related SDG 
index by calculating an arithmetic or geometric mean of 
the scaled values. For GBD 2016, we transformed each 
health-related SDG indicator on a scale from 0 to 100, in 
order from worst to best, with 0 being the 2·5th percentile 
value observed over the time period 1990–2030 
(ie, 
including 
projected 
values) 
and 
100 
the 
97·5th percentile value observed during this time. This 
was implemented in log-space for mortality and 
incidence rates.
To estimate the health-related SDG index, we first 
computed the geometric mean of each scaled health-
related SDG indicator for a given target, followed by the 
geometric mean of resulting values across all SDG 
targets (reflecting the preference-weighted approach 
described above). The geometric mean allows indicators 
with very high values to partly compensate for low values 
on other indicators (referred to as partial sub 
stitutability). 
To avoid problems with indicator values close to 0, when 
computing indices we applied a floor of 1 to all indicators. 
The same process was used to construct the MDG and 
non-MDG indices. Results of sensitivity analyses based 
on alternative approaches to create the SDG, MDG, and 
non-MDG indices are detailed in appendix 1.
SDG indicator attainment
Of the 37 health-related indicators measured in 
GBD 2016, 24 had defined targets, with 21 having 
absolute targets to reach by 2030, and three featuring 
targets relative to 2015 levels (ie, SDG target 3.4, “By 2030, 
reduce by one third premature mortality from NCDs”). 
For these 24 indicators, we applied these thresholds to 
determine achievement by 2030 (or 2020, in the case of 
road injury mortality [SDG indicator 3.6.1]). 17 health-
related 
indicators 
had 
targets 
citing 
“achieving 
elimination”, “ending epidemics”, or “reaching uni 
versal 
coverage or access”. For these indicators we set target 
thresholds as at least 99% for universal coverage or 
access and achieving a rate of 0·000005 or less for 
measures of morbidity (ie, ≤0·005 per 1000 or ≤0·5 
per 100 000) and 0·5% for prevalence. The table details 
the target thresholds or relative reductions applied for 
each indicator with a defined target.
Because some of these elimination targets have been 
operationalised in terms of reducing incidence or 
prevalence by 2030,40 we applied a more conservative 80% 
reduction threshold from 2015 to 2030 for indicators 
with established elimination SDG targets and compared 
these results. We also used a threshold of 90% or more 
for indicators with universal coverage or access in this 
conservative target attainment scenario.41
Comparing performance on the health-related SDGs 
across the development spectrum
In addition to examining global patterns in SDG 
performance, we report on differences in the health-
related SDG index and individual indicators across 
levels of development. To do this, we use the Socio-
demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of 
overall development that was originally introduced as 
part of GBD 2015.30 SDI is based on income per capita, 
mean years of education among populations 15 years 
and older, and total fertility rates, on a scale of 0 to 1. 
We use the SDI quintiles established in the GBD 
study to compare performance and progress on the 
health-related SDGs. More details on the estimation 
of SDI can be found in accompanying GBD 2016 
publications.28–32
Uncertainty analysis
GBD produces 1000 draws for all indicator estimates by 
location, age, and sex (when relevant) and for all years 
from 1990 to 2016. These draws from the posterior 
distribution represent uncertainty in the underlying 
data sources as well as the various steps in the 
estimation process. Further details on this are provided 
in the accompanying GBD 2016 papers28–32 and in 
appendix 1 for each indicator. These 1000 draws are 
used to determine 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) in 
each of the scaled SDG indicators, as well as the three 
indices, using simulation analysis.
To estimate uncertainty in SDG indicators and indices 
for the projected values, we applied the median rate of 
change chosen from the out-of-sample validity test to 
each of the 1000 draws of the indicator to estimate 
1000 draws of each indicator for the time period 
2017–30. Additionally, for each of the 1000 draws we 
allow for year-to-year deviation from the median rate of 
change on the basis of the variance across all draws.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in the study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. The corresponding author had full 
access to all the data in the study and had final

Results
Health-related SDGs in 2016
Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56·7 
(IQR 31·9–66·8) in 2016, with marked country-level 
variation. Countries with the highest values on the health-
related SDG index in 2016 were Singapore (86·8, 95% UI 
84·6–88·9), Iceland (86·0, 84·1–87·6), and Sweden 
(85·6, 81·8–87·8). Countries with the lowest were 
Afghanistan (10·9, 9·6–11·9), the Central African Republic 
(11·0, 8·8–13·8), and Somalia (11·3, 9·5–13·1; figure 1).

formance was much more 
heterogeneous across levels of SDI, with many high-SDI 
countries performing relatively poorly. These findings 
were exemplified by the USA, which fell below 50 on 
suicide mortality, harmful alcohol use, and inter 
personal 
violence mortality in 2016. Not 
ably, per 
formance on 
vaccine coverage, a new indicator as part of the GBD SDG 
assessment, was generally high across the develop 
ment 
spectrum with the exception of the lowest SDI countries; 
in fact, several middle-SDI countries such as Brazil had 
among the highest scores.
In 2016, the highest scores on the health-related SDG 
index were found among Nordic countries, the UK, a 
subset of western European countries, Singapore, 
Australia, Canada, and Israel, with these countries 
comprising the tenth decile of performance (figure 2). 
Several western European countries (eg, France, Spain, 
and Portugal), the USA, New Zealand, Japan, and 
South Korea occupied the next decile of highest 
performance on the health-related SDG index. The vast 
majority of countries in the first decile—places with the 
lowest scores on the health-related SDG index—were in 
sub-Saharan Africa, particularly western sub-Saharan 
Africa, as well as a subset of central and eastern sub-
Saharan African countries. Afghanistan was the only 
country in the first decile outside of sub-Saharan Africa. 
Other regions showed sizeable differences on the health-
related SDG index in 2016; for instance, in Latin America, 
Costa Rica scored as high as the ninth decile and several 
countries (ie, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Uruguay) 
were in the eighth decile, whereas Guyana scored as low 
as the fourth decile. A similar range was found in 
North Africa and the Middle East, spanning from Jordan 
in the eighth decile to Yemen in the second decile. China 
was in the seventh decile on the health-related SDG index 
in 2016, while Russia was in the fifth decile and India was 
in the fourth decile.
By comparing performance on the health-related SDG 
index in 2016 with total health expenditure and DAH per 
capita received from 2010 to 2014 (figure 3),28,31 insights 
might be gleaned regarding the association between 
overall health funding and performance on the health-
related SDG index and whether DAH is being directed 
toward those countries with the greatest need. Generally, 
total health expenditure is positively correlated with 
performance on the health-related SDG index; however, 
considerable variation exists at the same level of 
expenditure. For example, among countries with a 
health-related SDG index of 30 to 70, the association 
between total health expenditure per capita and 
performance varied massively, spanning at least a 7 times 
difference in spending with similar levels of performance 
on the health-related SDG index. For countries that 
received DAH between 2010–14, some of the most 
pronounced differences in cumulative DAH per capita 
received in the 2016 index were in sub-Saharan Africa, 
with several countries in southern sub-Saharan Africa 
posting nearly three times more cumulative DAH per 
capita than a number of countries in central and western 
sub-Saharan Africa. Most notably, some of the poorest 
performers on the health-related SDG index, such as the 
Central African Republic, South Sudan, Somalia, and 
Niger, received relatively little DAH.
Progress on UHC
Among the health-related indicators refined or added for 
GBD 2016, the UHC index (SDG indicator 3.8.1) saw the 
most substantive revision because it was expanded to 
represent a broader range of essential health services and 
to capture quality of care. From 2000 to 2016, performance 
on the UHC index generally improved throughout the 
world (figure 4 and appendix 2 p 5). Cambodia, Rwanda, 
Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China recorded the 
largest improvements since 2000, all recording an 
increase of 15 or more on the UHC index. Other countries 
with particularly pronounced progress on the UHC index 
included Timor-Leste, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Nepal 
in Asia and Oceania; Ethiopia and Angola in sub-Saharan 
Africa; and Lebanon in north Africa and the Middle East. 
At the same time, a mixture of countries registered 
minimal progress on the UHC index since 2000. These 
included lower-SDI countries, such as Lesotho and the 
Central African Republic, as well as some of the highest-
SDI countries, such as the USA and Andorra. In 2016, 
Switzerland, Iceland, and Finland had the highest UHC 
index performance, all exceeding 85 on a scale of 0–100, 
followed by Norway, Sweden, and Japan. Conversely, the 
lowest levels on the UHC index were in Somalia, the 
Central African Republic, and Afghanistan, which were 
all below 35, followed by South Sudan, Chad, and 
Guinea-Bissau.
Health-related SDGs in 2030
Based on trends from 1990 to 2016, projections of the 
health-related SDG index in 2030 generally showed gains 
(figure 5). Nonetheless, these projections also highlighted 
the potential for stagnated progress in places, as well as 
possible worsening of performance by 2030 if current 
trajectories are not addressed. Kazakhstan, Timor-Leste, 
Angola, Nigeria, and Swaziland were projected to have the 
largest improvements by 2030 on the basis of past trends. 
For most of these countries, projected gains in performance 
on the UHC index and for a number MDG-related 
indicators, including MMR, under 
-5 mortality, neonatal 
mortality, met need for family planning with modern 
contraception methods, and skilled birth attendance were 
shared contributing factors (appendix 2 pp 6–7). 
Kazakhstan had somewhat different patterns, where 
projections based on past trends for mortality rates from

NCDs, road injuries, and suicide also were among the 
primary contributing factors for such gains. On the other 
hand, 2030 projections based on past trends suggest that 
a subset of countries, including Sri Lanka, Venezuela, 
Ukraine, and Serbia could experience worsening 
performance driven by their past trends on indicators 
including childhood overweight and harmful alcohol use. 
At the same time several low-middle-SDI countries to 
low-SDI countries were projected to have marked 
improvements on the health-related SDG index (eg, Laos, 
Mozambique, Uganda, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Nepal, and 
Rwanda). Perhaps most importantly, on the basis of past 
trends, a subset of low-SDI countries are projected to show 
minimal progress by 2030 and will continue to have low 
scores on the health-related SDG index (figures 5 and 6), 
such as the Central African Republic.
Projected attainment of defined SDG targets
Based on predictions of past trends for SDG indicators 
with defined targets, stark differences emerged in terms of 
projected achievement by 2030 by indicator (figure 7). 
Globally, more than 60% of countries were projected to 
attain the SDG targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal 
mortality, MMR, and malaria by 2030; however, these four 
indicators all had at least 50% of countries already meeting 
2030 targets in 2016. SDG indicators with the next highest 
levels of projected attainment on the basis of past trends 
were skilled birth attendance (48% of countries), house-
hold air pollution (40%), and well-certified death regis-
tration (35%). By contrast, of the 24 SDG indicators with 
defined targets, 11 indicators had fewer than 5% of 
countries projected to meet corresponding targets on the 
basis of past trends. These indicators predominantly 
involved those calling for eliminating a health challenge 
(eg, childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and intimate 
partner violence) or achieving universal coverage or access 
(eg, met need for family planning and the UHC index). 
Additionally, on the basis of past trends, few countries 
were projected to achieve the SDG targets set forth for 
NCD and suicide mortality (ie, reduce by one-third from 
2015 to 2030), with 6% of countries meeting this target for 
NCD mortality and 3% for suicide. Furthermore, on the 
basis of past trends, no country was projected to meet the 
SDG target for road injury mortality, which calls for a 50% 
reduction from 2015 to 2020.
Overall, based on past trends, projected attainment of 
defined SDG indicator targets in 2030 was closely 
associated with SDI, with the highest levels of target

Figure 1: Performance on the health-related SDG index, MDG index, and non-MDG index, and 37 individual health-related indicators, by country, 2016
Countries are ranked by their health-related SDG index from highest to lowest in 2016. Indices and individual indicators are reported on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 representing the worst levels from 1990 
to 2030 and 100 reflecting the best during that time. Definitions of health-related SDG indicators are shown in the table. SDG=Sustainable Development Goal. MDG=Millennium Development Goal. Disaster 
mort=mortality due to exposure to forces of nature. MMR=maternal mortality ratio. SBA=skilled birth attendance. NN mort=neonatal mortality. Mort=mortality. Incid=incidence. NTD prev=prevalence of 
15 neglected tropical diseases. NCD mort=mortality due to a subset of non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases). FP need met, mod=family 
planning need met with modern contraception methods. Adol birth rate=adolescent birth rate. UHC index=universal health coverage index. Air poll mort=mortality attributable to household air pollution 
and ambient air pollution. WaSH mort=mortality attributable to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene. Poisoning mort=mortality due to unintentional poisonings. Smoking prev=prevalence of daily 
smoking. Vaccine cov=vaccine coverage of target populations based on national vaccine schedules. Int partner viol=prevalence of intimate partner violence. HH air poll=prevalence of household air pollution. 
Occ burden=disease burden attributable to occupational risks. Mean PM2.5=fine particulate matter smaller than 2·5 μm. Homicide=mortality due to interpersonal violence. Conflict mort=mortality due to 
conflict and terrorism. Violence prev=prevalence of physical or sexual violence. Child sex abuse=prevalence of childhood sexual abuse. Cert death reg=well-certified death registration.

achievement occurring among higher-SDI countries. 
However, among these high-middle and high-SDI coun-
tries, the vast majority had already met these targets 
by 2016, particularly those from the MDG era (ie, MMR, 
child mortality, malaria, and household air pollution). 
Some GBD super-regions showed considerable gains for 
attaining certain SDG targets between 2016 and 2030, 
including vaccine coverage and household air pollution in 
Latin America and the Caribbean; skilled birth attendance 
in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania; and under-5 
mortality and neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. 
With no south Asian countries attaining the SDG targets 
for child mortality and malaria in 2016, projections based 
on past trends pointed to 40% of south Asian countries 
meeting malaria incidence threshold of 0·005 cases or less 
per 1000 in 2030, and 80% of countries attaining the SDG 
target for under-5 mortality and 60% of countries attaining 
the target for neonatal mortality.
Of the 24 currently measured health-related indicators 
with defined SDG targets, a median of five (IQR 2–8) 
indicator targets were projected to be met by 2030, with no 
country attaining more than 13 (figure 8). On the basis of 
past trends, 18 countries are projected to meet at least 
ten indicator targets, including Finland (13 targets), 
Denmark and Switzerland (11 targets each), and Germany, 
Ireland, Norway, Singapore, Spain, and the UK each 
projected to meet ten targets. 31 countries met eight or nine 
indicator targets in 2030 on the basis of past rates of 
progress, including Canada, South Korea, Sweden, and 
the USA (nine targets each), and Australia, Chile, China, 
and Japan each reaching eight targets. At the other end of 
the scale, more than 20% of countries (44 of 188) are 
projected, on the basis of past trends, to meet fewer than 
two indicator targets in 2030, with most of these countries 
in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Exceptions to note in 
sub-Saharan Africa are Botswana and Cape Verde (projected 
to meet five indicator targets in 2030 on the basis of past 
trends), Swaziland and Namibia (projected to meet four), 
and South Africa and Rwanda (projected to meet three).
The use of more conservative target thresholds 
(ie, 80% reduction from 2015 to 2030 for elimination 
targets and ≥90% for universal coverage or access targets) 
resulted in notably higher projected attainment for SDG 
indicators linked to universal coverage or access targets 
(figure 7B). This was most pronounced for vaccine 
coverage, with 78% of countries projected to meet the at 
least 90% threshold in 2030 on the basis of past trends, 
compared with 29% of countries meeting at least 
99% coverage in 2030. Considerable differences in 
attainment were also found for skilled birth attendance, 
water, sanitation, access to hygiene, and household air 
pollution with at least 90% as the threshold for attainment.

health-related SDG index in 
2016 to cumulative total 
health expenditure 
per capita (A) and 
cumulative development 
assistance for health 
per capita (B), from 2010–14, 
by GBD region
The health-related SDG index 
is reported on a scale of 0–100, 
with 0 representing the worst 
levels from 1990 to 2030 and 
100 reflecting the best during 
that time. Total health 
expenditure includes 
development assistance for 
health and government, out-
of-pocket, and pre-paid private 
health spending. Of the 
188 countries in this analysis, 
184 had estimates of total 
health expenditure per capita; 
North Korea, Palestine, Taiwan 
(Province of China), and 
Zimbabwe were excluded due 
to missing data on national 
health expenditure. 
130 countries were recipients 
of development assistance for 
health from 2010 to 2014. 
Countries are abbreviated 
according to the ISO3 code.

Projected attainment based on past trends moderately 
increased for malaria (69%) and neglected tropical dis-
eases (36%) with the 80% reduction scenario; otherwise, 
projected attainment for the other SDG indicators with 
elimination targets did not change with the application of 
this more conservative target. Globally, the median of 
indicator targets projected to be met by 2030 increased 
to eight (IQR 3–11) when more conservative targets were 
used for elimination and universal coverage or access SDG 
indicators (figure 8B). More detail on projected attainment 
of SDG indicator targets based on past trends can be found 
in appendix 2.
Comparing the difference between projected rates of 
change from 2016 to 2030, on the basis of past progress, 
and required rates of change that need to be achieved 
between 2016 and 2030 to meet defined SDG indicator 
targets can help identify which health areas to prioritise 
in the SDG era (figure 9). Globally, dramatic acceleration 
of progress is most needed for indicator targets that call 
for eliminating health challenges, such as the child 
malnutrition indicators, especially childhood overweight; 
infectious diseases, particularly tuberculosis and neg-
lected tropical diseases; and violence indicators. The 
magnitude by which such gains must be hastened 
from 2016 to 2030 often differed across the development 
spectrum, with higher-SDI countries generally requiring 
far less acceleration than lower-SDI countries. The main 
exceptions included childhood overweight, road injury 
mortality, and violence indicators, for which fairly similar 
rates of acceleration of progress are necessary to reach 
corresponding SDG targets across levels of SDI.
Further results are in appendix 2, and dynamic 
visualisations are available online. 
Discussion
Summary of findings
Formally adopted in 2015, the SDG agenda lays out a 
series of bold goals and accompanying targets and

The health-related SDG index is reported on a scale of 0–100, with 0 representing the worst levels from 1990 to 2030 and 100 reflecting the best during that time. The dashed line shows the 
equivalence line, such that values that fall on this line are equivalent for both the health-related SDG index in 2016 and, based on past trends, the projected health-related SDG index in 2030. Countries 
are abbreviated according to the ISO3 code. SDI=Socio-demographic Index. SDG=Sustainable Development Goal.

indicators for attainment by 2030. In the present study, 
we produced independent and comparable estimates 
of 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators across 
188 countries and projected indicators to 2030 on the 
basis of past trends observed in each country. Our 
findings show considerable inequality in the health-
related SDG index in 2016, spanning from 86·8 in 
Singapore to 10·9 in Afghanistan. Our revised UHC 
measure, which incorporates a broader range of tracer 
indicators including essential health services for NCDs, 
further highlights geographical and sociodemographic 
dis 
parities on a key component of the health-related 
SDGs. Our projections of the health-related SDG 
indicators point to further entrenchment of these 
in 
equalities in the future unless current trajectories 
are considerably altered. On the basis of past trends, 
only 21% of health-related SDG indicators with de-
fined targets were projected to be met by 2030, 
rang 
ing from 38% among high-SDI countries to 
merely 3% among low-SDI countries. Even when we 
applied more conservative attainment thresholds, this 
only increased 30% of health-related SDG indicators with 
defined targets being met by 2030. Attainment varied 
considerably across the different indicators, from more 
than 60% of countries projected to meet 2030 targets on 
the basis of past trends for under-5 mortality, neonatal 
mortality, MMR, and malaria to fewer than 5% projected 
to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including 
those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road 
injury mortality. These projections based on past trends 
underscore the need for dramatic, if not unprecedented, 
acceleration of progress to improve health outcomes, 
reduce risk exposure, and expand essential health 
services for all countries to achieve the health-related 
SDGs by 2030. Such action is particularly crucial for 
countries already showing signs of being left behind, 
such as the Central African Republic, Afghanistan, 
Somalia, and South Sudan.
UHC in the SDG era
Achieving UHC—access to quality essential health 
services, medicines, and vaccines, and the provision of 
financial risk protection—is increasingly viewed as 
imperative to attaining the health-related SDGs.13–18 
Previously, monitoring of progress on the first component 
of UHC, access to quality essential health services, has 
been mainly limited to tracking the coverage but not 
quality of interventions for maternal, reproductive, and 
child health outcomes and selected communicable 
diseases. Amid gains in development, many countries’

Deciles were based on the distribution of the health-related SDG index values in 2016 and then were applied for the projected SDG index in 2030. Deciles ranged from less than 22·4 (first decile) to at 
least 75·1 (tenth decile) in 2016. Projections were based on past trends and rates of change observed from 1990 to 2016. SDG=Sustainable Development Goal. ATG=Antigua and Barbuda. VCT=Saint

health systems remain unable to fully respond to the rise 
in NCDs and the demand for more specialised types of 
medical care.20,42 This trend is shown in the divergence by 
SDI quintile on the more traditional UHC proxy measure 
and our updated UHC index (appendix 2 p 4), which 
accounts for an array of NCD outcomes amenable to 
health care, as well as capturing quality of care.
Although a number of countries saw minimal gains, 
including low-SDI countries such as Lesotho and the 
Central African Republic but also high-SDI countries 
such as the USA, our findings also highlight that progress 
can be made on expanding UHC. Several countries, 
including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, 
Turkey, and China showed substantial improvements on

Figure 7: Percentage of countries attaining health-related SDG indicator targets in 2016 and projected to attain in 2030 based on past trends, according to defined SDG targets (A), and 
defined and conservative SDG targets (B), by indicator, across all countries and by GBD super-region and SDI quintile
All projections were based on past trends and rates of change observed from 1990 to 2016. Of the 37 health-related indicators measured in this study, 24 had defined targets linked to each indicator. 
Definitions of health-related SDG indicators and defined targets associated with them are shown in the table. SDG target 3.6 aims to reduce road injury mortality by 50% between 2015 and 2020, and 
thus projected attainment for this indicator is based on estimates from 2015 to 2020 rather than 2015 to 2030. For (B), conservative targets were defined as an 80% reduction for elimination targets 
from 2015 to 2030, and ≥90% by 2030 for universal access or coverage. Under the conservative scenario (B), targets with specific values to meet by 2030 or with specified relative reductions remained as 
originally defined. SDG=Sustainable Development Goal. SDI=Socio-demographic Index. MMR=maternal mortality ratio. SBA=skilled birth attendance. Under-5 mort=under-5 mortality. NN mort=neonatal 
mortality. Mort=mortality. Incid=incidence. NTD prev=prevalence of 15 neglected tropical diseases. NCD mort=mortality due to a subset of non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, cancer, 
diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases). FP need met, mod=family planning need met with modern contraception methods. UHC index=universal health coverage index. Vaccine cov=vaccine coverage 
of target populations based on national vaccine schedules. Int partner viol=prevalence of intimate partner violence. HH air poll=prevalence of household air pollution. Child sex abuse=prevalence of

the UHC index between 2000 and 2016. Enacting large-
scale health-care reforms and adopting nationwide 
social health insurance programmes, which enable 
populations to access essential health services without 
incurring large financial burdens, are shared character-
istics for several countries with notable gains on the 
UHC index.43 Nonetheless, how quickly such government-
led initiatives have been formally established, and then 
how 
these 
programmes 
have 
been 
effectively 
implemented, scaled up, and maintained nationwide 
vary substantially. This highlights the need for long-term, 
sustained political commitment to achieving UHC, 
alongside establishing adequate financing and policies 
that cover services. For instance, after a change in 
government in 2002, Turkey introduced its Health 
Transformation Program in 2003 with the explicit aim of 
improving public health, providing health insurance for 
all, and expanding access to care.44,45 The phased 
implementation of UHC-focused reforms in Turkey, 
alongside continued political support, allowed the country 
to achieve remarkable strides in achieving UHC and 
improving care.44,45 Yet many country stakeholders and 
officials fear that the momentum around UHC in Turkey 
might 
stall, 
especially 
amid 
increasing 
regional 
instability.44 China’s health-care reforms largely began in 
the early 2000s, with government-funded insurance 
schemes increasingly covering rural populations and 
unemployed urban residents,46,47 which was then followed 
by a more comprehensive health reform in 2009–10 
focused on service delivery, essential medicines, public 
health, insurance, and public hospitals. Strong govern-
ment commitment to expanding health care to all 
populations allowed China to make rapid gains in UHC, 
although concerns about long-term financing and the 
growth of private insurance are likely to challenge the 
durability of such political support. Rwanda initiated a 
pilot programme of its community-based health 
insurance programme (Mutuelles de santé [Mutuelles]) in 
1999–2000, and then proceeded to formalise and expand 
the programme nationwide from 2004 to 2008.48 Again, 
strong political commitment to UHC is viewed as a 
major factor in the rapid expansion of Mutuelles in 
Rwanda;49 nonetheless, Rwanda still faces many 
challenges in terms of UHC financing. In Cambodia, 
extended health reforms began in the 1990s, gradually 
rebuilding the country’s health system and laying the 
groundwork for UHC financing arrangements through 
long-term national health planning.50 Cambodia has yet 
to establish a consolidated national insurance system, 
though 
the 
government 
recently 
signalled 
its 
commitment to UHC with the March, 2016, Social Health 
Protection Framework. Overall, our findings on UHC 
highlight the scope for progress through deliberate, 
sustained health system investments and political 
commitment. Further exam 
ination of the health system 
structures, attributes, and financing mechanisms in 
countries where progress has occurred on the UHC 
index could offer further insights into how essential 
health services can be further expanded in health-care 
settings across the development spectrum.
Greater investments in health required among the 
worst off
With its broadened development agenda, the SDGs 
present substantial financing concerns to higher- 
income 
and lower-income countries alike. Projections of govern-
ment health spending and DAH suggest that absolute 
levels of overall health spending are likely to remain low 
among lower-income countries,38,51 empha 
sising the 
importance of both increased DAH and larger allocations 
toward health to the extent possible in the SDG era.52 
Echoing the SDG mantra of “leaving no one behind”, 
DAH ideally should be targeted toward those with the 
greatest need. Our analysis shows that a number of 
countries with the worst performance on the health-
related SDG index in 2016 received among the lowest 
cumulative DAH per capita from 2010 to 2014. The vast 
majority of these countries were in western and central 
sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Afghanistan; a number of 
these countries have experienced protracted conflict or 
recent surges in civil unrest. Although lower DAH 
allocations might be justified in settings with limitations 
in terms of governance or absorptive capacity, in the 
longer term in the absence of expanded, sustained inter-
national support, and increased domestic financing to the 
extent possible, these countries risk falling further behind 
in the SDG era.
Intersectoral action is essential to the health-related 
SDGs
The confluence of factors leading to poor performance 
on the SDGs in the worst-off countries underscores how 
the achievement of several health-related SDG targets 
will require intersectoral action. Focusing on key socio-
demographic factors (eg, improving educational attain-
ment and reducing poverty) might facilitate gains on 
health-related SDGs.53,54 Furthermore, many of the 
health-related SDGs are not as amenable to traditional 
DAH-supported programmes.55 This is particularly 
relevant to the health-related SDG indicators for 
homicide and violence, natural disasters, and conflict; 
indicators with a strong environmental focus (eg, mean 
levels of PM2·5 [fine particulate matter smaller than 2·5 
μm] and mortality attributable to air pollution) or clear 
links with infrastructure and corresponding laws 
(eg, road traffic mortality); and broader public health 
programmes and policies focused on behavioural risk 
factors (eg, smoking). Ongoing conflict or recent 
resurgences of violence in the Central African Republic, 
Afghanistan, Somalia, and South Sudan—countries that 
were among the worst off in 2016—also risk further 
entrenching poor health outcomes in the SDG era. War 
and conflict have widespread, dire ramifications for 
health systems and related infrastructure, as most

recently shown by the 2016–17 cholera outbreak in Yemen 
as the country’s water supply goes untreated.56 Several 
case studies underscore the importance of intersectoral 
action in making headway on improving SDG indicators, 
such as legislative successes in combating the tobacco 
industry in Uruguay57 and rebuilding the decimated 
health system in Timor-Leste after prolonged conflict.58
SDG target setting
Our results showed relatively low levels of projected 
attainment by 2030 across the health-related SDGs. In 
GBD 2015, we emphasised the ambitious nature of 
SDG target 3.3, which calls for ending the epidemics 
of HIV and tuberculosis; based on our projections of 
past trends, only 7% of countries were projected to meet 
the 0·005 cases or less per 1000 threshold for HIV 
incidence and no country was projected to meet the 
target for tuberculosis in 2030. A total of 11 indicator 
targets had fewer than 5% of countries projected to 
meet them by 2030, including childhood overweight, 
suicide mortality, and road injury mortality. Although 
we applied more conservative attainment thresholds 
(ie, 
an 
80% 
reduction 
for 
elimination 
targets 
and ≥90% for universal coverage or access targets), we 
still found that no country was projected to meet this 
target for tuberculosis and no additional countries 
reached this target for HIV. At the same time, coverage 
measures (eg, vaccine coverage and skilled birth 
attendance), environmental risks (ie, water, sanitation, 
access to hygiene, and household air pollution), malaria, 
and neglected tropical diseases were among the 
indicators for which using more conservative targets 
resulted in a larger percentage of countries with 
projected SDG attainment by 2030. Notably, if the road 
injury mortality target was extended to 2030 rather 
than 2020, as the original SDG proposal entailed,59 
five countries—Austria, Finland, Portugal, Spain, and 
Slovenia—would have achieved 50% reduction in road 
injury mortality on the basis of past trends.
For our analysis, we have used the same threshold for 
SDG targets that call for ending an epidemic or elim-
inating a health challenge and target universal access or 
coverage. We recognise, however, that these targets vary 
considerably in how they are defined quantitatively among 
stakeholders. For example, in relation to SDG target 3.3, 
becoming malaria-free involves having no local cases for 
3 continuous years and a formal certification process.60 By 
contrast, WHO Global Malaria Technical Strategy for 
2016–30 calls for a reduction of incidence of 90% between 
2015 and 2030;61 the WHO Post-2015 HIV agenda calls for 
a reduction in HIV incidence by 90% between 2010 
and 2030 among adults;62 and the Stop TB Global Plan to 
End TB calls for a reduction in tuberculosis incidence 
by 80% between 2015 and 2030.40 Furthermore, confusion 
or tension might arise around reconciling ambitious SDG 
nutrition targets (ie, SDG target 2.2 “By 2030, end all 
forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the 
inter 
nationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in 
children”) with the Global Nutrition Targets 2025, which 
established somewhat different aims (ie, reduce stunting 
by 40% from 2010 to 2025 and reduce wasting to <5% 
by 2025).63 A delicate balance exists between identification 
of targets that spur progress but are at the same time 
achievable. Our projections of SDG achievement might 
help to identify ambitious yet more feasible targets across 
these indicators (eg, using the 95th percentile in levels 
achieved by 2030). They also might be of particular utility 
to national monitoring agencies as they develop and 
implement national-level targets to complement the 
global SDG indicator framework.5
Comparisons with other assessments
To date, a number of other international organisations or 
collaborations have reported on country-level estimates of 
SDG indicators, including WHO, SDSN, and the World 
Bank.7,10,11 Of the 50 health-related indicators currently 
included in the global SDG framework, GBD 2016 reported 
on 37, whereas WHO included 34 in the 2017 World Health 
Statistics report, the World Bank covered 28 for the 
2017 SDG Atlas, and the 2017 SDSN SDG index included 23. 
The GBD study offers a number of advantages for 
monitoring progress on the health-related SDGs, which 
includes producing comparable, comprehensive indicator 
estimates for all 188 countries from 1990 to 2016. By 
contrast, substantial variation was found for country 
inclusion across the health-related indicators reported by 
other organisations and collaborations. For instance, 
WHO provided estimates for 194 of 194 member states for 
under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, and tuberculosis, yet 
only 104 countries had estimates for HIV, 122 for met need 
for family planning, and 128 for smoking prevalence. 
Additionally, no other agency measuring the health-related 
SDGs provides a complete and consistent set of years. 
Across these organisations, the latest year of reporting 
ranges from 2013 to 2016, and for several indicators, data 
from a range of years are combined to represent the most 
recent year available in countries. Examples include 2005 
to 2015 or 2016 for skilled birth attendance and met need 
for family planning as reported by WHO. Last, proxy or 
Figure 8: Map of the number of health-related SDG indicator targets, based

targets (A), and conservative and defined SDG targets (B)
All projections were based on past trends and rates of change observed 
from 1990 to 2016. Of the 37 health-related indicators measured in this study, 
24 had defined targets linked to each indicator. Definitions of health-related 
SDG indicators and defined targets associated with them are shown in the table. 
SDG target 3.6 aims to reduce road injury mortality by 50% between 2015 
and 2020, and thus projected attainment for this indicator is based on estimates 
from 2015 to 2020 rather than 2015 to 2030. For (B), conservative targets were 
defined as an 80% reduction for elimination targets from 2015 to 2030, 
and ≥90% by 2030 for universal access or coverage. For the conservative 
scenario (B), targets with specific values to meet by 2030 or with specified 
relative reductions remained as originally defined. SDG=Sustainable

partial measures are currently used by other agencies or 
collaborations for a subset of health-related SDG indicators, 
which can be directly measured by the GBD. For instance, 
the UN definition for SDG indicator 2.2.2 includes 
childhood overweight, yet the prevalence of adult obesity is 
reported by SDSN for this indicator. Another example is 
limiting the measure of met need for family planning to

Black stripes represent median absolute change and boxes represent IQR. Health-related indicators are colour-coded according to the health-related goals they represent. All projections were based on 
past trends and rates of change observed from 1990 to 2016. Of the 37 health-related indicators measured in this study, 24 had defined targets linked to each indicator. Here we present on 23 of these 
indicators as SDG indicator 17.19.2c, well-certified death registration, had 27 countries with 0% in 2016 and were projected to be the same in 2030. Annualised rates of change observed and required 
for this indicator were calculated as infinite (and thus implausible). SDG target 3·6 aims to reduce road injury mortality by 50% between 2015 and 2020, and thus annualised rates of change calculated 
for this indicator are based on estimates from 2015 to 2020 rather than 2015 to 2030. Definitions of health-related SDG indicators and targets associated with them are shown in the table . SDI=Socio-
demographic Index. SDG=Sustainable Development Goal. MMR=maternal mortality ratio. SBA=skilled birth attendance. Mort=mortality. Incid=incidence. NN mort=Neonatal mortality. NTD 
prev=prevalence of 15 neglected tropical diseases. NCD mort=mortality due to a subset of non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases). 
Suicide mort=mortality due to self-harm. FP need met, mod=family planning need met with modern contraception methods. UHC index=universal health coverage index. Vaccine cov=vaccine 
coverage of target populations based on national vaccine schedules. Int partner viol=intimate partner violence. HH air poll=household air pollution. Child sex abuse=childhood sexual abuse.

metadata indicator definition explicitly includes all women 
of reproductive age. To properly monitor progress and 
identify challenges in achieving the health-related SDGs, 
it is critical to measure indicators’ levels and trends in a 
timely, comparable, and complete manner.
Future GBD SDG monitoring
With its annual cycle, the GBD study has enabled the 
incorporation of a number of important revisions and 
additions to monitor the health-related SDGs. For GBD 
2016, the most notable advances include improving UHC 
index (SDG indicator 3.8.1) to reflect a broader array of 
conditions covered by essential health services, as well as 
the addition of two violence indicators and vaccine 
coverage (SDG indicator 3.b.1). For vaccine coverage, we 
plan to further improve its measurement in GBD 2017, 
namely estimating the correlation structure between the 
coverage of individual vaccines to more precisely measure 
the UN’s definition for SDG indicator 3.b.1 (ie, proportion 
of the target population covered by all vaccines included in 
their national programme).
The continued expansion and refinement of health-
related indicator measurement is a key priority for 
GBD 2017 and beyond. Specifically, an assessment 
of health worker density and distribution (SDG indicator 
3.c.1) is presently underway and will be included in GBD 
2017
. Pending data availability, estimating the prop 
ortion 
of people who feel safe walking alone around the area 
where they live (SDG indicator 16.1.4) also should be 
feasible for GBD 2017
. Work is underway to estimate the 
coverage of treatment interventions for substance use 
disorders (SDG indicator 3.5.1), as well as the prevalence 
of sexual violence by non- 
intimate partners for women 
aged 15 years and older (SDG indicator 5.2.2). To date, 
however, estimating sexual violence by non-intimate 
partners has been severely limited by a paucity of data 
outside of western Europe and the USA. A key area of 
future work relates to the March, 2017, revisions to SDG 
indicator 3.8.2,5 which was modified to more directly 
capture financial risk protection by including an indicator 
of catastrophic house 
hold expenditures on health.
In the present study, we used a relatively simple approach 
for projecting trends for health-related SDG indicators 
through 2030. This method is based on using the historical 
rates of change for each country, with more recent trends 
weighted more heavily. This approach does not explicitly 
link the likelihood of SDG achievement to underlying 
investment areas to reach the SDGs; for example, 
increasing overall or specific types of DAH, enacting 
socioeconomic policies, implementing health programmes, 
expanding coverage of currently available interventions, 
scaling up new interventions or medical technologies, and 
reducing or preventing exposure to underlying risks. This 
more 
structured 
approach 
for 
projecting 
SDG 
achievement—including the ability to quantify the potential 
impact of different SDG investment scenarios—is 
currently under development as part of the GBD.
Strengths
A number of strengths, as well as limitations, exist for 
our study. The extensive GBD collaboration, which 
currently includes more than 2500 individuals from 
more than 135 countries and territories, is a core 
strength. This collective ownership model, in which 
GBD collaborators actively participate in the production, 
review, and use of results, addresses many recent 
critiques regarding the generation of global health esti-
mates.64 Specifically, the GBD collaborative network 
identifies and facilitates access to the latest, locally 
relevant data sources; works with individuals and instit-
utions in reviewing and generating GBD estimates; and 
provides both national and subnational avenues for the 
translation and use of results for decision making.65–69 An 
increasing number of in-depth country engagements 
with the GBD are also producing subnational assess-
ments of disease burden and maximising policy rele-
vance. For instance, spearheaded by the Indian Council 
for Medical Research and the Public Health Foundation 
of India, GBD is presently undertaking state-level disease 
burden assessments in India, disaggregated by urban 
and rural areas as part of GBD 2016. This work has been 
characterised by intensive engagement with the Indian 
Government and the Indian scientific community in the 
production of estimates.
Recent changes to the global SDG monitoring frame-
work, as well as the proposal of processes to consider 
indicator revisions annually and potential additions 
in 2020 and 2025,5 now establish the SDGs as a dynamic 
development agenda. This is unlike previous international 
goal-setting efforts, such as the MDGs.21 Subsequently, 
timely efforts to track newly added and revised indicators 
are central to the ability of the SDG agenda to evolve over 
time. By the nature of its annual reporting cycle, the 
extensive range of health indicators currently or potentially 
measured, and the location of work within academic and 
scientific organisations, the GBD study is well positioned 
to quickly respond to indicator revisions and expansion. 
This is highlighted by the incorporation of March, 2017, 
indicator refinements into GBD 2016 (eg, vaccine coverage 
[SDG indicator 3.b.1]), and our ability to report on 
important violence indicators that no other international 
agency currently includes. Of the new health-related SDG 
indicators proposed for consideration by the IAEG-SDGs, 
most could be incorporated into the GBD measurement 
cycle with relative ease; these indicators include psycho-
active substance abuse, incidence of road traffic injuries, 
incidence of unintentional poisonings, prevalence of 
anaemia among women of reproductive age, and illnesses 
attributable to risk factors (air pollution and unsafe water, 
sanitation, and hygiene). Other indicators that cover, for 
example, other dimensions of mental health and NCDs 
have also been proposed. Continued improve 
ments in 
indicator measurement are also facilitated through novel 
extensions and developments from the broader GBD 
study and related work, which is exemplified by 
 Global Health Metrics

incorporating the HAQ Index into our UHC measure for 
GBD 2016. Another priority area for GBD expansion is the 
increased ability to track key health indicators, not only at 
subnational administrative levels, but also as a continuous 
geospatial surface. Research on mapping inequalities in 
child mortality at a 5 km × 5 km resolution in Africa has 
leveraged the GBD study,70 providing an example of the 
increasing ability to track SDG indicator attainment at 
levels beyond national averages.
Limitations
A number of specific limitations for SDG indicators 
exist, described in the underlying GBD papers as well as 
in appendix 1. Of note, for sanitation (a key determinant 
of health) we have used a proxy indicator based on 
measuring the fraction of the populations that have 
unimproved sanitation, improved sanitation without a 
sewer connection, and improved sanitation with a sewer 
connection. This does not take into account whether 
waste is safely managed or treated. For the vaccine 
coverage indicator, we used a proxy indicator based on 
the geometric mean of vaccine coverage of individual 
vaccines and did not explicitly account for the correlation 
structure that exists between individual vaccines.
As noted in more detail above, we have used a relatively 
simple approach for projecting SDG indicator values. 
Limitations also exist in terms of the construction of the 
health-related SDG index. Ideally, we would develop an 
index that scales indicator values to SDG target values. 
We have not implemented this in GBD 2016 for several 
reasons. First, 13 of the health-related SDG indicators do 
not presently specify a target. Second, a subset of SDG 
targets are relatively modest for many middle-SDI to 
high-SDI countries (eg, reducing MMR to <70 deaths 
per 100 000 livebirths), and the effect of rescaling to 
these targets is that any differences beyond the target are 
ignored. In constructing the health-related SDG index, 
we used the geometric rather than arithmetic mean. The 
geometric mean allows for partial substitutability (ie, 
poor performance on one indicator is only partially offset 
by good performance on another), while the arithmetic 
mean allows for complete substitutability (ie, poor 
performance on one indicator can be completely offset 
by good performance on another indicator). As a result, 
stagnating progress on some indicators—most notably 
indicators such as childhood overweight and harmful 
alcohol use—can have a notable effect on progress and 
our projections based on past trends of the overall 
health-related SDG index. As noted in appendix 1, 
constructing the health-related SDG index using the 
arithmetic mean suggests somewhat more optimistic 
but qualitatively similar progress on the health-related 
SDGs as measured by the index, with no country 
showing a decline. As part of future iterations of the 
GBD we will continue to test and refine alternative index 
construction approaches that can take into account 
SDG targets.
Our assessment reflects ongoing gaps in data availability 
and coverage across countries for some indicators and 
remains a major limitation to any SDG monitoring effort, 
including GBD. For example, data for the violence 
indicators are sparse, particularly for non-intimate partner 
violence, men as victims of sexual violence, and 
psychological violence. Measurement issues, such as the 
variability and accuracy of self-report of different types of 
violence across settings, pose additional challenges. 
Limitations also exist for the water, sanitation, and hygiene 
indicators, particularly in view of the relative absence of 
data to estimate safe sanitation management. A benefit of 
the GBD study is that it can help identify these data gaps, 
both over time and by location, and provide an interim 
solution to data gaps through the use of standardised 
estimation approaches. Nevertheless, the GBD is not, and 
should not be, a replacement for investing in high-quality, 
routine health information systems that are crucial for 
measuring and evaluating SDG progress at national and 
subnational levels. Last, any limitations of GBD 2016 
relevant to the 37 currently measured health-related SDG 
indicators apply.28–32
Conclusion
Understanding where countries are, and where they are 
likely to go on the basis of past trends, is essential to 
guide strategic and investment decisions to achieve the 
SDG agenda by 2030. With this updated GBD analysis of 
the SDGs, we measure 37 of the 50 health-related SDG 
indicators from 1990 to 2016, and provide projections of 
SDG attainment by 2030 on the basis of past trends. For 
a subset of indicators, such as under-5 mortality and 
neonatal mortality, MMR, and malaria, projected levels 
of SDG achievement are promising, particularly among 
higher-SDI countries. However, these more positive 
projections for SDG attainment appear to be the 
exception, with most countries, especially countries in 
western and central sub-Saharan Africa and low-SDI 
countries, facing a challenging road toward SDG 
achievement by 2030 on the basis of current trajectories. 
It is increasingly clear that the health-related SDG agenda 
hinges upon markedly accelerating progress, particularly 
among the world’s poorest populations. Succeeding in 
this endeavour is not yet an impossibility—nonetheless, 
it will demand extraordinary financial and political 
commitment by national and international agencies alike 
to ensure that truly no one is left behind in 2030.
