moking cessation is of critical importance for patients 
immediately following an acute coronary syndrome, sub-
stantially reducing negative outcomes such as reinfarc-
tion and death among successful quitters.1–4 The acute hospital 
admission is a “teachable moment” in which smokers may be 
more receptive to information about quitting and more moti-
vated to make a quit attempt.5 It is also a valuable opportunity to 
provide smokers, particularly those who may not have been in 
recent contact with a health care provider, with assistance in 
quitting and to organize longitudinal support for a quit attempt, 
as patients return for regular follow-up after acute coronary 
syndrome.
However, there is limited evidence available concerning the 
use of smoking cessation therapies in patients with acute cardio-
vascular conditions. Although the use of nicotine replacement 
therapies (e.g., nicotine patch and nicotine gum) is common, 
there is a lack of clinical trial data supporting the efficacy and 
safety of these therapies in patients with cardiovascular disease.6,7

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Patients who continue to 
smoke after acute coronary syndrome 
are at increased risk of reinfarction and 
death. We previously found use of varen-
icline to increase abstinence 24 weeks 
after acute coronary syndrome; here we 
report results through 52 weeks.
METHODS: The EVITA trial was a multi-
centre, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial of varenicline 
for smoking cessation in patients admit-
ted to hospital with acute coronary syn-
drome. Participants were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to receive varenicline or 
placebo for 12 weeks, in conjunction 
with low-intensity counselling. Smoking 
abstinence was assessed via 7-day 
recall, with biochemical validation using 
exhaled carbon monoxide. Participants 
lost to follow-up or withdrawn were 
assumed to have returned to smoking.
RESULTS: Among the 302 participants, 
abstinence declined over the course of the 
trial, with 34.4% abstinent 52 weeks after 
acute coronary syndrome. Compared with 
placebo, point estimates suggest use of 
varenicline increased point-prevalence 
abstinence (39.9% v. 29.1%, difference 
10.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01% 
to 21.44%; number needed to treat 10), 
continuous abstinence (31.1% v. 21.2%, 
difference 9.9%, 95% CI –0.01% to 19.8%) 
and reduction in daily cigarette smoking 
by 50% or greater (57.8% v. 49.7%, differ-
ence 8.1%, 95% CI –3.1% to 19.4%). Varen-
icline and placebo groups had similar 
occurrence of serious adverse events 
(24.5% v. 21.9%, risk difference 2.7%, 95% 
CI –7.3% to 12.6%) and major adverse car-
diovascular events (8.6% v. 9.3%, risk dif-
ference –0.7%, 95% CI –7.8% to 6.5%).
INTERPRETATION: Varenicline was effi-
cacious for smoking cessation in this 
high-risk patient population. However, 
60% of patients who received treatment 
with varenicline still returned to smok-
ing. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.

Additionally, data from a number of trials suggest that bupropion 
is not efficacious in this population.8–10 Varenicline, a partial ago-
nist of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, has been widely 
studied in the general population, with efficacy appearing to 
meet or exceed that of nicotine replacement therapies and 
bupropion.11–13 Along with bupropion, varenicline has been shown 
to increase abstinence in patients with stable cardiovascular dis-
ease; however, its efficacy in patients with acute coronary syn-
drome was previously unknown.6 We have recently shown that 
use of varenicline increases smoking abstinence 24 weeks after 
acute coronary syndrome.14 Here we report evidence concerning 
the efficacy and safety of varenicline for smoking cessation 
52 weeks after acute coronary syndrome. 
Methods
Study design
The Evaluation of Varenicline in Smoking Cessation for Patients 
Post–Acute Coronary Syndrome (EVITA) trial is a randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 302 participants across 
Canada and the United States. The methods of this trial have 
been previously described in detail.15 Enrolment took place dur-
ing hospital admission for acute coronary syndrome, including 
myocardial infarction and unstable angina with clinically signifi-
cant coronary artery disease. To be eligible, patients had to be 
motivated to quit and have smoked 10 or more cigarettes per 
day for the past year. Patients with a history of mental illness 
were excluded, as was standard practice for clinical trials at the 
time of study design, owing to concerns about serious neuropsy-
chiatric events in individuals with pre-existing psychiatric dis-
ease taking varenicline. Those who consented to participate and 
met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned 
1:1 to varenicline tartrate (0.5 mg daily for 3 days, then 0.5 mg 
twice daily for 4 days, followed by 1.0 mg for 11 weeks) or match-
ing placebo for 12 weeks, combined with low-intensity counsel-
ling for smoking cessation and relapse prevention. Treatment 
was initiated in-hospital.
Follow-up and end points
Participants were followed for 52 weeks after acute coronary syn-
drome, with telephone calls at weeks 1, 2 and 8, and clinic visits 
at weeks 4, 12, 24 and 52. Self-reported smoking abstinence was 
biochemically validated at clinic visits using exhaled carbon 
monoxide (Micro 3/4 Smokerlyzer, Bedfont Scientific Ltd.). Mea-
surement of exhaled carbon monoxide is a practical and reliable 
method of assessing smoking status, which correlates with the 
frequency and quantity of cigarettes smoked.16 Although its abil-
ity to detect nonrecent smoking (> 8 h) is limited,16 participant 
perception of greater efficacy may increase the validity of self-
report data.17
The prespecified primary end point was smoking abstinence 
at week 24 (previously reported).14 Point-prevalence abstinence 
was defined as self-reported abstinence in the past week (no 
smoking, not even a puff), with exhaled carbon monoxide levels 
of 10 ppm or less. Continuous abstinence was defined as self-
reported abstinence in the past week at all follow-ups since 
baseline, with exhaled carbon monoxide levels of 10 ppm or less 
at all clinic visits. Reduction in daily cigarette consumption by 
50% or greater was also assessed.
Statistical analysis
We used the intention-to-treat principle for all analyses. As in 
other trials of smoking cessation, our analyses assumed that 
participants who were lost to follow-up or withdrew returned to 
smoking at their baseline rate. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to examine the effect of this assumption. Participants 
who died were censored from analyses after death. The number 
needed to treat (NNT) represents the number of patients with 
acute coronary syndrome who needed to receive treatment with 
varenicline for 1 patient to be abstinent. Statistical analyses were 
performed using SAS software (version 9.3).
Ethics approval
This study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki; locally 
appointed ethics committees approved the research protocol, 
and informed consent was obtained from participants before 
enrolment.
Results
Participant characteristics
Participants enrolled in the trial (n = 302) (Figure 1) were 
primarily male (75.2%) with a mean age of 55.0 (standard 
deviation [SD] 9.3) years, and had been smoking for the past 
3–4 decades (35.9 [SD 11.6] yr). At the time of their acute 
coronary syndrome (56.0% ST-segment elevation myocardial 
infarction, 37.8% non–ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction and 6.3% unstable angina), participants were smoking 
a mean of 21.4 (SD 10.6) cigarettes per day. Most (80.4%) had a 
score of 4 or greater on the Fagerström Test for Nicotine 
Dependence, indicating moderate or severe dependence on 
nicotine. Most had made at least 1 previous attempt to quit 
smoking (81.8%) and many had another smoker living at home 
(41.7%). Participant characteristics (Table 1) were well-balanced 
between the varenicline and placebo groups,14 with the 
exception of the proportion of participants with another smoker 
at home, which was higher in the varenicline group (48.3% v. 
35.1%, difference 13.2%).
Drug course
The median length of hospital stay was 3 (interquartile range 
[IQR] 2–4) days, and the median time from admission to the first 
dose of study medication was 2 (IQR 1–3) days. At the conclusion 
of the treatment period (12 wk), most participants reported 
taking 2 pills per day (per the protocol): 70.5% of participants in 
the varenicline group compared with 82.1% of participants in 
the placebo group (p = 0.07; adherence data available for 
218 participants). An additional 7.1% in the varenicline group 
and 2.8% in the placebo group reported taking 1 pill per day (as 
may be recommended to reduce adverse effects). Study 
personnel and participants were unaware of treatment 
allocation until the conclusion of the trial, with participant

guesses of treatment assignment no better than chance (49.1% 
in the varenicline group and 48.8% in the placebo group 
correctly guessed their treatment assignment at week 12).
Smoking cessation
Point-prevalence smoking abstinence declined over the course 
of the trial (Figure 2), from a high of 58.6% of all participants at 
week 1 to a low of 34.4% of all participants at week 52. There was 
an immediate difference in abstinence between the varenicline 
and placebo groups beginning at the first follow-up telephone 
call at week 1: 66.2% versus 51.0%, respectively. The difference 
in point-prevalence abstinence remained significant at all follow-
ups through the end of the 12-week treatment period and 
52-week follow-up (differences and 95% confidence intervals 
[CIs] presented in Appendix 1, supplementary Table 1, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170377/-/DC1). 
A similar trend was observed for continuous abstinence, with 
significant differences observed between groups throughout the 
12-week treatment period, although CIs included the null at 
week-24 and -52 follow-up (Appendix 1, supplementary Table 1).
Smoking abstinence and reduction data from clinic visits at 
weeks 4, 12, 24 and 52 are shown in Figure 3. Abstinence data at 
the primary end point of week 24 have been previously 
reported.14 At week 24, use of varenicline was found to increase 
point-prevalence smoking abstinence (47.3% v. 32.5%) and 
reduction in daily cigarette consumption by 50% or greater 
(67.4% v. 55.6%) compared with placebo. Continuous 
abstinence rates were 35.8% in the varenicline group versus 
25.8% in the placebo group at week 24. At week 52, point-
prevalence smoking abstinence was significantly higher in the 
varenicline group (39.9.%) compared with the placebo group 
(29.1%) (difference 10.7, 95% CI 0.01% to 21.44%; NNT 10). 
Rates of continuous abstinence at week 52 were 31.1% in the 
varenicline group versus 21.2% in the placebo group (difference

9.9%, 95% CI –0.01% to 19.8%). Reduction in daily cigarette 
consumption by 50% or greater was 57.8% in the varenicline 
group compared with 49.7% in the placebo group (difference 
8.1%, 95% CI –3.1% to 19.4%). Among only those who 
continued to smoke, reduction by 50% or greater was 29.5% in 
the varenicline group and 29.0% in the placebo group 
(difference 0.5%, 95% CI –12.3% to 13.4%).
Abstinence was biochemically validated using exhaled car-
bon monoxide at clinic visits. A total of 81.7% of participants 
self-reporting abstinence at week 52 provided biochemical vali-
dation (owing to completion of some clinic visits by telephone, 
as necessary to obtain participant follow-up). Of these, only 
1 participant had a carbon monoxide reading greater than 
10 ppm and was classified as having returned to smoking. Sensi-
tivity analyses were conducted for smoking abstinence and 
reduction at weeks 4, 12, 24 and 52, which included only partici-
pants who returned for follow-up (in order to assess the effect of 
the assumption that participants who withdrew or were lost to 
follow-up returned to smoking at their baseline rate). These 
unadjusted analyses found similar differences in smoking absti-
nence and reduction end points (Appendix 1, supplementary 
Tables 1 and 2).

Low-intensity counselling and nonstudy cessation 
therapies
As part of the trial, participants received low-intensity counsel-
ing, with a mean of 51.4 (SD 33.5) minutes for all participants 
from baseline to week 52. Participants were also permitted to 
seek counselling outside of the study; however, only 2.7% of par-
ticipants did so at any point (equal in each treatment arm). Fol-
lowing the 12-week treatment period, participants who had 
relapsed were also permitted to use nonstudy pharmacotherapy 
treatments for smoking cessation. Use of a nonstudy treatment 
at any point in the trial was 18.3% overall (14.9% in the vareni-
cline group v. 21.8% in the placebo group). Participants reported 
using (non–mutually exclusive categories): 6.6% e-cigarette, 
6.0% nicotine patch, 4.3% short-acting nicotine replacement 
therapy (e.g., gum, inhaler or lozenge), 2.6% varenicline and 
2.0% other.
Safety
The occurrence of serious adverse events was similar between 
trial arms (Table 2). Overall, there were 93 serious adverse 
events between baseline and week 52, occurring in 70 patients 
(37 in the treatment arm [24.5%] and 33 in the placebo arm 
[21.9%]). A total of 30 major adverse cardiovascular events 
were reported in 27 patients (13 in the treatment arm [8.6%] 
and 14 in the placebo arm [9.3%]), including 17 myocardial 
infarctions, 11 hospital admissions for unstable angina and 
2 cardiovascular deaths (2 patients experienced both myocar-
dial infarction and unstable angina, and 1 patient had 2 sepa-
rate instances of unstable angina). Both deaths occurred within 
30 days of treatment discontinuation in patients in the vareni-
cline arm (1 because of congestive heart failure 40 days after 
randomization and 18 days after discontinuing study drug; the 
other due to sudden death 25 days after randomization in a 
patient presumed to have taken the study drug until the time of 
death). A single noncardiovascular death occurred in a patient 
in the varenicline arm due to a perforated ulcer 63 days after 
study drug discontinuation.
Interpretation
Use of varenicline significantly increased abstinence compared 
with placebo (39.9% v. 29.1%) 52 weeks after hospital admission 
for acute coronary syndrome. This finding is important given the 
substantial reduction in cardiovascular risk conferred by smok-
ing cessation in this high-risk population.1,2,18,19 In addition, rates 
of serious adverse events (24.5% v. 21.9%) and major adverse 
cardiovascular events (8.6% v. 9.3%) were similar between 
varen 
icline and placebo arms. This suggests that varenicline is 
safe for use in these patients. However, new strategies for smok-
ing cessation are still needed, given that 60% of smokers who 
received treatment with varenicline returned to smoking by 
1 year after their acute coronary syndrome.
The use of varenicline in the EVITA trial differed in one signifi-
cant way from the usual method of administration recom-
mended. Typically, patients are instructed to begin taking the 
drug 8–14 days before a quit date to allow time for titration and 
bioaccumulation.20 In the EVITA trial, whereas the dose was 
titrated as recommended over 7 days, participants were already 
not smoking at the time of randomization (due to hospital 
admission) and were instructed not to resume smoking on dis-
charge. This approach appears to have been efficacious, given 
that the differences between groups were apparent from week 
1, with only half of participants in the placebo arm abstinent 
(51.0%) compared with two-thirds of participants in the vareni-
cline arm (66.2%). However, this approach could have resulted 
in increased “slips” (i.e., temporary lapses to smoking) early in 
the trial, limiting our ability to detect significant differences 
between groups in regard to continuous smoking abstinence.
Safety concerns related to neuropsychiatric events and car-
diovascular events associated with the use of varenicline21–25 
have largely been resolved,26–30 with high-quality evidence sug-
gesting that varenicline is safe for use in both populations with 
prior psychiatric illness and history of cardiovascular disease. In 
particular, compelling evidence has been generated by the 
EAGLES trial (n = 8144 participants),31 which found no difference 
in the incidence of neuropsychiatric events between individuals 
(with or without psychiatric disease) receiving varenicline, 
bupropion, nicotine patch or placebo. There were very few seri-
ous cardiovascular adverse events reported, with no apparent 
differences between groups. Likewise, the CATS trial (n = 
4595 participants) found no difference in the incidence of major

addition, Sterling and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of 
38 randomized controlled trials (n = 12 706 participants), which 
found no difference in serious cardiovascular adverse events 
when comparing varenicline with placebo in populations either 
with or without cardiovascular disease.33 Overall, evidence accu-
mulated from these trials and meta-analyses provides strong 
support that use of varenicline is safe for smoking cessation.

A) Smoking cessation: point-prevalence abstinence.  Participants were considered abstinent if they abstained from smoking in the 7 days before 
the visit through a self-report of 0 cigarettes smoked per day, confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide levels of 10 ppm or less (available for 
94.7%, 87.3%, 79.7% and 81.7% of self-reported abstinent participants at weeks 4, 12, 24 and 52, respectively). Risk differences: 4 weeks, 22.3 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 11.2 to 33.3); 12 weeks, 21.3 (95% CI 10.3 to 32.3); 24 weeks, 14.9 (95% CI 3.9 to 25.8); 52 weeks, 10.7 (95% CI 0.01 to 
21.4). B) Smoking cessation: continuous abstinence. Participants were considered abstinent if they abstained from smoking through a self-
report of 0 cigarettes smoked per day, confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide levels of 10 ppm or less (available for 96.9%, 91.0%, 82.6% and 
88.5% of self-reported continuously abstinent participants at weeks 4, 12, 24 and 52, respectively) at all follow-up visits. Risk differences: 
4 weeks, 19.6 (95% CI 8.6 to 30.5); 12 weeks, 14.5 (95% CI 3.7 to 25.3); 24 weeks, 10.0 (95% CI –0.4 to 20.4); 52 weeks, 9.9 (95% CI –0.1 to 19.8). 
C) Reduction in daily cigarette consumption of 50% or more from baseline; self-report only. Risk differences: 4 weeks, 12.4 (95% CI 3.7 to 21.2); 
12 weeks, 16.1 (95% CI 5.9 to 26.4); 24 weeks, 11.7 (95% CI 0.8 to 22.7); 52 weeks, 8.2 (95% CI –3.1 to 19.4). *Adjusted for loss to follow-up. †In

were motivated to quit smoking. Therefore, our findings may not 
be generalizable to patients with stable cardiovascular disease 
or to the general population of hospital-admitted smokers after 
acute coronary syndrome. Second, counselling provided to both 
groups was of low intensity, which may have reduced quit rates 
overall. However, our findings may represent a real-world sce-
nario in which patients receive (or seek) little psychosocial inter-
vention. Participants were encouraged to use additional counsel-
ling resources outside of the study, and only 2.7% did so at any 
point. Lastly, our findings may underestimate the efficacy of 
varen 
icline over time for several reasons. The first is that partici-
pants who had not successfully quit were permitted to use other 
smoking cessation therapies during trial follow-up. Given that 
21.8% of participants in the placebo arm compared with 14.9% in 
the varenicline arm used other cessation therapies, this may 
have resulted in an underestimation of the efficacy of vareni-
cline. Likewise, an imbalance in proportion of participants with 
another smoker living at home (48.3% in the varenicline arm v. 
35.1% in the placebo arm) may have resulted in increased 
relapse in the varenicline group.
Conclusion
We examined the efficacy of varenicline versus placebo, initiated 
in-hospital and in conjunction with low-intensity counselling, for 
smoking cessation 52 weeks after acute coronary syndrome. We 
found that varenicline is efficacious for smoking cessation; how-
ever, 60% of patients who received treatment with varenicline 
still returned to smoking by 1 year. If varenicline were used rou-
tinely after acute coronary syndrome, for every 10 smokers who 
received treatment there would be 1 less smoker a year later.
