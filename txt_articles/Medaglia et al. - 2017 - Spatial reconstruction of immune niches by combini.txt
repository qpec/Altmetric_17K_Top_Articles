Cellular functions are strongly dependent on surrounding cells and environmental factors.
Current technologies are limited in their ability to characterize the spatial location and
gene programs of cells in poorly structured and dynamic niches. We developed a method,
NICHE-seq, that combines photoactivatable fluorescent reporters, two-photon microscopy,
and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to infer the cellular and molecular composition
of niches. We applied NICHE-seq to examine the high-order assembly of immune cell
networks. NICHE-seq is highly reproducible in spatial tissue reconstruction, enabling
identification of rare niche-specific immune subpopulations and gene programs, including
natural killer cells within infected B cell follicles and distinct myeloid states in the spleen and
tumor. This study establishes NICHE-seq as a broadly applicable method for elucidating
high-order spatial organization of cell types and their molecular pathways.
I
mmune function depends on the dynamic in-
teractions of heterogeneous cell types with
the tissue microenvironment. Both innate and
adaptive immune responses rely on signals
from neighboring cells to initiate cell fate
decisions and deploy effective defensive, meta-
bolic, or tissue repair programs. For example,
macrophages exhibit specialized organ-specific
cellular functions owing to interactions with dis-
tinct cells in different tissues (1). Spatial heter-
ogeneity in immune niches has typically been
studied by microscopy-based methods (2–4).
These have allowed the identification of impor-
tant immune functions that are dependent on
the spatial location of various tissue-resident
immune cells and environmental factors (5, 6).
Despite this important progress, most of these
findings remain anecdotal, because we still lack
a systematic approach to characterize the cellular
compositions and molecular pathways of func-
tional tissue niches.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is
emerging as an important tool to study the func-
tional space of immune cell types and states (7, 8).
Currently, most scRNA-seq techniques require
tissue homogenization, with the inevitable loss of
spatial information (9). Further, because mam-
malian tissues are composed of trillions of cells
that reside in specific tissue subcompartments
and whose relative abundances vary by several
orders of magnitude, brute force approaches may
not be effective in identifying rare populations
of cells congregated in a particular niche (10).
Techniques combining scRNA-seq with spatial
information obtained through various barcod-
ing approaches show promising results but are
limited in sequencing depth and widespread
utility (11–14). Similarly, methods for spatial re-
construction of tissue that combine scRNA-seq
with single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybrid-
ization of a few “landmark genes” are effective,
but they depend on structured tissue organiza-
tions and a priori knowledge of differentially ex-
pressed genes and are therefore limited in their
applicability (15, 16).
To overcome these limitations, we developed
NICHE-seq, a method that combines photo-
activatable fluorescent markers, two-photon
laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM), and flow
cytometry–based fluorescence-activatedcell sort-
ing (FACS) coupled to massively parallel scRNA-
seq [MARS-seq (7)]. We used transgenic mice
ubiquitously expressing a photoactivatable green
fluorescent protein (PA-GFP) that allows precise
in situ labeling by two-photon irradiation of
diverse cellular niches in both live animals and
ex vivo settings (6). After tissue dissociation,
niche-specific labeled cells can be analyzed by
MARS-seq, thus combining transcriptional cell
state and spatial information (fig. S1).
To visualize specific tissue niches, we intra-
venously transferred 2 × 107 TdTomato+ T cells
and 4 × 107 CFP+ B cells into PA-GFP mice to
serve as landmark cells and photoactivated the
B cell follicles or the T cell area of inguinal lymph
nodes (LNs) at 820 nm. Subsequent imaging
at 940 nm confirmed the bright and specific
activated PA-GFP signal only within the photo-
activated areas (Fig. 1A). To further examine the
cell-labeling specificity, we analyzed by FACS the
frequency of PA-GFP+ cells in photoactivated and
nonphotoactivated (control) LNs from the same
mice. We observed specific activated PA-GFP+
cells in photoactivated LNs, with no labeled cells
in control LNs not subjected to photoactivation
(fig. S2A). FACS analysis of the photoactivated
B cell follicles showed that activated PA-GFP+
cells constituted 1.5% of the total live cells. Of
these, 92% were B cells and 8% were T cells (6.7%
CD4+ and 1.3% CD8+) (Fig. 1B and fig. S2A). Anal-
ysis of photoactivated cells from the T cell area
showed similar specificity: Of the activated PA-
GFP+ cells, 90% were T cells (37% CD4+ and 53%
CD8+) and 10% were B cells (Fig. 1B and fig. S2A).
To evaluate the effectiveness of niche photo-
activation with single-cell genomic profiling for
spatial reconstruction, we performed MARS-seq
analysis on sorted, photoactivated cells (fig. S1,
B to F). Clustering analysis (17) of 3900 photo-
activated cells from B cell follicles and T cell
areas identified five major clusters including
B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1C;
fig. S2, B to D; and table S1). Overlaying the niche
labels on top of the clusters showed results com-
parable to the FACS analysis, with 39% of the PA-
GFP+ cells from the T cell area corresponding to
CD4+ and 56% to CD8+ T cell subsets (Fig. 1C).
Similarly, within B cell follicles, 95% of the cells
corresponded to B cells. To evaluate the enrich-
ment of cells in a particular niche de novo, we
sequenced an additional 487 cells from a control
LN that was not photoactivated and calculated
the enrichment of the same cell types and states
in the PA-GFP+ niche as compared with data
from random single-cell sampling of the entire
tissue (Fig. 1D) (17). This analysis showed more
than twofold enrichment of B cells and depletion
of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the B cell follicles
compared with the entire LN (Fig. 1D). Similarly,
in the T cell area, B cells were depleted, whereas
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were enriched (Fig. 1D).
These results were highly reproducible across bio-
logical replicates of photoactivated LNs from differ-
ent mice (fig. S2E). Importantly, photoactivation
did not induce notable changes in gene expres-
sion; photoactivated and control T orB cellsshowed
similar gene expression profiles (fig. S2F).
Under homeostatic conditions, and especial-
ly during immune challenges, the B and T cell
regions in LNs host rare populations of cells from
different lineages that fulfill various critical func-
tions, such as antigen presentation and costimu-
lation. To evaluate the sensitivity of NICHE-seq
in identifying and characterizing these popula-
tions, we injected lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV) into the footpad of PA-GFP mice
and applied NICHE-seq to measure the change in
the cellular composition of the B cell follicles and
T cell areas in inguinal LNs 72 hours after infec-
tion (fig. S3, A and B). Clustering of 8100 cells
identified seven major cell types, including B cells,
CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells,
dendritic cells (DCs), and inflammatory mono-
cytes (Fig. 1E; fig. S3, C to E; and table S2). Mono-
cytes and DCs were predominantly localized in

flammatory monocyte subset enriched within

our data confirm the reproducibility, sensitivity,

characterizing specific niches within LNs, includ-
ing rare subpopulations, both at steady state and

 We next sought to extend the NICHE-seq ap-
proach to the spleen. To identify the composition
of the splenic B cell follicles, T cell areas, and the
marginal zone (MZ, or the interface between the
nonlymphoid red pulp and the lymphoid white
pulp), we used three different cellular landmarks.
Fluorescently labeled B and T cells were adop-
tively transferred into irradiated wild-type mice
previously transplanted with bone marrow cells
from PA-GFP andCX3CR1-GFPmice(at a7:3 ratio).
We sorted and sequenced 7852 photoactivated
PA-GFP+ single cells from these niches (Fig. 2,
A and B; fig. S4A; and table S3). We found a high
degree of heterogeneity, with 16 different clusters
(Fig. 2B and fig. S4, B to D). These included sev-
eral subsets of B and T cells, as well as myeloid
cells, plasma cells (PCs), and NK cells. Sequenc-
ing 3071 immune cells from the total spleen for
reference, we found that many of the different
cell types are highly specific to particular niches
(fig. S4E). For example, regulatory T cells (Tregs)
were specifically localized to the T cell area and
defined by high expression of Foxp3, Cd4, Icos,
and Folr4 (Fig. 2, C and D). The MZ niche dis-
played high complexity with various myeloid cell
types, including a MZ macrophage population
expressing high levels of Vcam1, Hmox1, C1qb,
and Cd5l (Fig. 2, B to D). Immunofluorescence
histology further confirmed the specific local-
ization of these VCAM-1+ CD5L+ macrophages
in the MZ (fig. S5). As before, these niche-
specific cell networks were reproducibly iden-
tified across biological replicates (Fig. 2C and
fig. S4F).
To further characterize the dynamics of splenic
niches upon systemic viral infection, we intra-
venouslyinjectedPA-GFPmicewithLCMV48hours
before photoactivation and NICHE-seq analysis.
Globally comparing the transcriptional changes
of 15,452 cells in different splenic regions—MZ,
T cell area, and B cell follicles—we observed sub-
stantial changes in the representation of cell types
within specific tissue niches, which were repro-
ducibly identified across biological replicates
(fig. S6, A and B). To better define the dynamics
of each cell population in these regions, we mea-
sured the changes in the frequencies of all cell
populations in every niche before and after in-
fection (Fig. 3A and fig. S6C). We found niche-
specific and cell-specific changes. For example,
after infection, the number of NK cells was sig-
nificantly increased in B cell follicles but decreased
in the MZ (Fig. 3A). These changes in the localiza-
tion of NK cells upon LCMV infection were con-
firmed by confocal immunofluorescent histology
(Fig. 3, B and C).
LCMV replicates in specific structures and cell
types in the spleen (19), but the cellular and mo-
lecular composition of the LCMV-infected niche
is not fully understood and is difficult to study
with current technologies. We used a recombi-
nant LCMV strain that selectively drives GFP
expression within infected cells (4) to identify
and photoactivate the LCMV-replicating niche,
which includes the cells interacting with the
infected area (fig. S7A). Comparing the virus-
replicating area with the total infected spleen,
we found that the former was enriched with NK
cells, monocytes, and macrophages (Fig. 3D).
Single-cell analysis can indicate the proliferative
potential of each cell (20); measuring the percent
of proliferating cells, we found that NK cells, in-
duced Tregs, and PCs were more proliferative in
the LCMV-infected area than in the total infected
spleen (fig. S7, B to D). The distinct expression
signatures of immune cells within the infected
niche compared with those of the same cell types
in other regions are poorly understood. Compar-
ing the transcriptional state of each cell type in
the total infected spleen versus in the LCMV-
infected area, we observed niche-specific expres-
sion programs (Fig. 3E and fig. S7E). For example,
monocytes in the infected area, but not in other
locations in the spleen, up-regulated the T cell

 chemoattractant Cxcl9, which attracted leuko-
cytes expressing its receptor CXCR3 (Fig. 3E). In
contrast, regulators of inflammatory response (e.g.,
Trem3) were expressed at higher levels in mono-
cytes outside the infected area and in much lower
levels within the infected area (Fig. 3E). These
niche-specific cell assemblies were reproducibly
identified across biological replicates (fig. S6B).
Although single-cell genomic analyses are al-
ready extending our knowledge to previously un-
explored cell types and gene pathways, dissecting
the cellular networks in tissues and organs im-
poses a major challenge. Our newly developed
NICHE-seq technology is a robust and flexible
approach for characterizing and modeling the
cross-talk between various immune cell types and
the local microenvironment and is applicable in
different biological systems. For example, apply-
ing NICHE-seq to measure the immune compo-
sition of various niches in B16.F10 melanoma
tumors, we identified different myeloid compo-
sitions within niches that have different extra-
cellular matrix structures (fig. S1 and fig. S8, A
and B). Inflammatory monocytes (CCR2high/
Ly6Chigh) were localized in regions of straight
collagen fibers, whereas tumor-associated macro-
phages were localized in less organized, curly col-
lagen fibers regions (fig. S8, C and E). Critically,
understanding how multicellular organisms as-
semble high-order functional units through com-
munication between different cell types in support
of sharedgoals,such asthefunctionof the immune
system, may pave the way to engineering tissue
function, with important potential for future de-
velopment of immunotherapeutic strategies.
Our experiments also highlight several oppor-
tunities for improvement. First, increasing the
palette of photoactivatable fluorescent report-
ers beyond PA-GFP would improve the spatial
resolution and throughput. This could be also
achieved by introducing various fate mapping and
optogenetic techniques for combined analysis of

 regional functions and transcriptomes. Second,
the excitation is currently binary (on/off), whereas
a gradient form of activation intensity and addi-
tional photoactivatable reporters combined with
index sorting could generate finer resolution of
cell organization within the labeled niche (8).
Third, the analytical challenges of identifying
the cell assemblies and correctly modeling these
niches will require the development of algorithms
that can accurately analyze the coexistence of
overlapping transcriptional programs and suc-
cessfully ameliorate the types of biases produced
by comparing highly different cellular niches.
Fourth, the current version of NICHE-seq is lim-
ited to genetically engineered model organisms,
but antibody-conjugated photoactivatable dyes
could be developed forhuman NICHE-seqstudies.
Despite the current limitations, our proof-of-
principle study shows that NICHE-seq can be used
as a molecular microscope that adds the spatial
dimension to single-cell genomic data, enabling
comprehensive investigation of a large number
of tissue structures at single-cell resolution.
