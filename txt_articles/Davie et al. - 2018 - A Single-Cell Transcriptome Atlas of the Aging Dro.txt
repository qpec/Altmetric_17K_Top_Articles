SUMMARY
The diversity of cell types and regulatory states in the
brain, and how these change during aging, remains
largely unknown. We present a single-cell transcrip-
tome atlas of the entire adult Drosophila mela-
nogaster brain sampled across its lifespan. Cell
clustering identified 87 initial cell clusters that are
further subclustered and validated by targeted cell-
sorting. Our data show high granularity and identify
a wide range of cell types. Gene network analyses
using SCENIC revealed regulatory heterogeneity
linked to energy consumption. During aging, RNA
content declines exponentially without affecting
neuronal identity in old brains. This single-cell brain
atlas covers nearly all cells in the normal brain and
provides the tools to study cellular diversity along-
side other Drosophila and mammalian single-cell
datasets in our unique single-cell analysis platform:
SCope (http://scope.aertslab.org). These results,
together with SCope, allow comprehensive explora-
tion of all transcriptional states of an entire ag-
ing brain.
INTRODUCTION
Brain function depends on a complex network of specialized
neuronal and glial cell types. Single-cell technologies allow map-
ping of this diverse cellular landscape, and single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) performed on developing mouse and
zebrafish brains (Han et al., 2018; Raj et al., 2018) and on parts
of the adult fly brain (Croset et al., 2018; Konstantinides et al.,
2018) have already revealed unique cell types. However, a
compendium of all cell types in a complete adult brain during
the lifespan of an animal has not yet been reported.
The Drosophila brain is ideal to build an atlas of cell types of a
complex functioning brain because it encodes an extensive array
of intricate behaviors (Owald et al., 2015) while only consisting of
approximately 100,000 cells, of which 85%–90% are neurons
(Kremer et al., 2017). Hundreds of neuronal types have been
functionally characterized based on the morphology of their pro-
jections, their connectivity with other neurons, or their role in
controlling behavior (Robie et al., 2017). However, the molecular
underpinnings of these cell types, such as the active gene regu-
latory networks and genes expressed in each cell type, have
been less studied. It is an open question as to what extent
neurons that build circuits with different spatial complexities,
connections, and behavioral functions are controlled by different
regulatory programs or whether they act as neutral building
blocks in a circuit, committed to canonical neuronal communica-
tion. Beyond the transcriptomes that underlie individual cell
types, it is unknown whether brain-wide ‘‘regulatory states’’ exist
that may be shared across multiple neuronal subtypes. Further-
more, during the lifetime of an animal, cell types and regulatory
states may change, and the timing of normal and pathological
loss of cell identity remains poorly described. Thus, comprehen-
sive, unbiased brain-wide single-cell sequencing is expected to
facilitate understanding of the cellular and regulatory basis of a
brain and to provide insights on the gradual loss of fitness and
cognition in aging (Tulving and Craik, 2005; Wyss-Coray, 2016).
Here, we built a comprehensive atlas of cell types in the entire
adult Drosophila brain, yielding nearly 13 ‘‘cell-coverage.’’ We
also developed a Drosophila database for SCENIC (Aibar et al.,
2017), allowing us to map the gene regulatory networks underly-
ing neuronal and glial types in the fly brain. In addition, we map
brain-wide cell-state changes that occur during aging. Finally,
we use machine-learning methods to accurately predict the
age of a cell based on its gene expression profile. We make

RESULTS
Single-Cell RNA-Seq of the Adult Brain Identifies
Discrete Cell Types
We applied scRNA-seq using droplet microfluidics (10x Chro-
mium) on dissociated adult brains from animals precisely
aged to eight different time points (Figure S1G; Table S1). To
take genetic diversity between domesticated D. melanogaster
strains into account, we dissected brains from two different
lab strains. Using stringent filtering, 56,902 (57K) high-quality
cells were retained from 26 runs (�29K cells for DGRP-551
and �28K cells for w1118) (Figures S1D–S1F). We also created
a larger dataset of 157K cells based on lenient cell filtering,
combined with cells from three additional DGRP-551 runs
that were performed with an alternative dissociation protocol
(Figures S1A–S1C). We achieved a median sequencing depth
of 53,553 sequence reads per cell, with median sequence
saturation rate of 81.5%. The total number of genes detected
across all cells was 12,436 protein-coding genes and 2,164
non-coding RNAs. The median number of genes per cell ranges
between 1,308 (0 days) and 810 (50 days). The 57K filtered
cells were clustered using Seurat (Satija et al., 2015), leading
to 87–151 cell clusters, depending on the clustering resolution.
We provide all clustering information, and markers for each
cluster, through an online resource called SCope. In SCope,
both the 57K and 157K datasets are available. In the remainder
of this article, we used the 57K dataset with 87 initial clusters
(Table S2). These cells were subsequently visualized by
generating
t-distributed
stochastic
neighbor
embedding
(t-SNE) plots (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) (Figure 1A;
location of each cluster on the t-SNE can be found in Data S1).
We connected cell clusters to known cell types using two ap-
proaches that rely on the markers identified in the single-cell
clusters (Table S3). In the first approach, we compared the iden-
tified markers for each cell cluster with previously published
marker genes for known cell types. We find 24,802 cells
(43.6%) that are cholinergic (VAChT), 13,296 (23.4%) glutama-
tergic (VGlut), and 6,177 (10.8%) GABAergic neurons (Gad1). A
smaller subset of monoaminergic neurons all express the
vesicular transporter-encoding gene Vmat and can be further
subdivided into serotonergic (SerT), octopaminergic/tyraminer-
gic (Tdc2), and dopaminergic (ple) neurons (Figure 1B).
We also distinguished photoreceptors (ninaC, trp, and trpl)
(Bernardo-Garcia et al., 2016; Goto et al., 2003; Montell and Ru-
bin, 1988) and multiple non-neuronal cell types based on previ-
ously published marker genes, including hemocytes (Hml) (Fig-
ure 1D). Using known markers, we identified glial subtypes
such as astrocytes (alrm), cortex glia (wrapper) (Figure 1D), and
surface glia (Indy) including perineurial (Vmat) and subperineurial
glia (moody) (Bainton et al., 2005; Stork et al., 2012). Glia in
general show high relative expression of lncRNA:CR34335, while
neurons have high relative expression of lncRNA:noe (Figures
S1E and S1F). In total, �3,600 (6.4%) glial cells are detected in
the 57K dataset, compared to �19,000 in the 157K dataset
(12.1%) (Figures S1B and S1C).
We also used known brain regions (neuropils) to identify cell
types (Ito et al., 2013) (Figure 1E). The mushroom body (MB) is
the center of learning and memory in flies and is comprised of
Kenyon cells (KCs), expressing ey and prt (Figure 1C). Among
the KCs, we could identify three clusters representing the
different MB lobes by a combination of markers, namely the a/b
lobe (sNPF), a0/b0 lobe (trio), and g lobe (sNPF, trio) (Awasaki
et al., 2000; Johard et al., 2008) (Figure 1F). We also identified
DAT as a specific marker for the a0/b0 neurons (Figures S3G and
S3H). Other groups of neurons that are identified are �350
Poxn-expressing cells of the protocerebral dorsal cluster and
the neurons of the deutocerebral ventral cluster (Boll and Noll,
2002; Minocha et al., 2017). Additionally, expression of tup, otp,
C15, and hth (Komiyama and Luo, 2007; Li et al., 2017) revealed
a separate cluster for antero-dorsal and lateral olfactory projec-
tion neurons of the antennal lobe (adPNs and lPNs, respectively).
In addition to the central brain, our annotation strategy allowed
us to identify multiple optic lobe cell types. For example, Mi1
neurons were identified by the expression of hth and bsh (Hase-
gawa et al., 2011), while T1 neurons are the only neuronal type to
express Eaat1 (Hamanaka and Meinertzhagen, 2010). We identi-
fied the GABAergic Pm1, Pm2, and Pm3 neurons by a combina-
tion of markers. All Pm neurons share expression of Lim3, while
Vsx1 is only expressed by Pm3, and svp is expressed by both
Pm1 and Pm2 (Erclik et al., 2017) (Figure 1F). Moreover, using
the expression of eya, hth, and Lim1, we were able to identify
separate clusters for the two types of lamina wide-field (Lawf)
neurons: Lawf1 (eya and hth) and Lawf2 (eya, hth, and Lim1)
(Chen et al., 2016). Finally, by using the histamine receptor ort,
we identified the optic lobe cell types that receive input from
the R7–R8 photoreceptors. Two clusters co-express VGlut and
ort, which could be linked to Tm5c and Dm8, but a division
between the two could not be made (Karuppudurai et al.,
2014; Melnattur et al., 2014).

 In a second approach, we compared gene expression in our
single-cell clusters with previously published transcriptomes of
Drosophila brain subpopulations. We fitted a regression model
on pseudo-bulk data derived from our cluster marker genes,
where a high weight in the model shows a high similarity between
the cluster and the public data. This strategy enabled the identi-
fication of unique single-cell clusters, as shown in Figure 1G. We
confirmed the previously labeled cell clusters for the KC sub-
types; the olfactory projection neurons (OPNs); and the Mi1,
T1, Dm8/Tm5c, and Pm neurons of the optic lobes; we also
annotated several new clusters, including L1-5, T2/T3, T4/T5,
Tm1/TmY8, Tm9, TmY14, and MB output neurons as well as en-
sheathing and chiasm glia (Figure 1G).
These efforts led to the direct annotation of 37 cell types. Most
neuronal cell types with known marker gene expression could be
mapped to defined single-cell clusters with few exceptions, such
as the dorsal cluster neurons (DCNs), that express ato and acj6
(Hassan et al., 2000). These cells only map to a single cluster
when we increase the Seurat clustering resolution from 2.0 to
8.0. Around 80 DCNs are expected in a single brain (Srahna
et al., 2006), and we detect 98. Using this higher resolution, we
are also able to identify the fructose-sensing neurons that co-ex-
press Gr43a and Crz (Miyamoto and Amrein, 2014). Large
unannotated clusters remain at the center of our t-SNE. These
cells
express
cholinergic,
GABAergic,
and
glutamatergic
markers but do not present outspoken gene signatures (even
though their UMI [unique molecular identifer] counts are not
lower than some of the more specialized cell types, suggesting
that they are high-quality cells; see Figure S3A). We could never-
theless separate these large clusters by the transcription factors
(TFs) D and disco. One possibility is that these cells represent
‘‘generic’’ neurons that serve as building blocks in circuits,
specialized by neurotransmitter type, not necessarily by further
sub-functionalization.
We
investigated
the
sensitivity
of
our
scRNA-seq
by
comparing the combined scRNA-seq data of all cells with bulk
RNA-seq of entire brains (Figure S2A). We find a high correlation
(r2 = 0.918) between the expression of genes in both datasets
(Figures S2B and S2E). There are several genes not detected
in the single-cell data, but these are genes that are also low in
abundance in the bulk RNA-seq (Figures S2C–S2H). Next, we
investigated biases to sex, genetic strain, and age of cells
(Figures S3B–S3F). This revealed that all clusters except one
(cluster 23) show high reproducibility between male and female
brains, between genetic backgrounds, across ages, and be-
tween technical replicates. Taken together, we conclude that
our single-cell dataset of the entire fly brain is of high quality.
We identified 87 clusters, for which annotations and sets of
specific marker genes can be explored in SCope.
Identification of Rare Cell Types by Targeted Cell
Sorting and Subclustering
To start identifying unlabeled cell clusters and map these to
specific neuronal populations, known Gal4 lines can be used
to express GFP in specific populations of cells, allowing them
to be FAC (fluorescence-activated cell) sorted and profiled by
scRNA-seq, as previously shown for the OPNs (Li et al., 2017).
We used this approach to test whether a particularly small
neuronal population of only �9 neurons per hemisphere is pre-
sent in our dataset (Figure 2A). These neurons are a subset of
the dorsal fan-shaped body neurons (dFB) and are genetically
targeted using R23E10-Gal4 (Figure 2A). We applied CEL-Seq2
on 22 FAC-sorted cells and two variants of SMART-Seq2 on
45 (standard protocol) and 34 (adapted protocol) cells. As ex-
pected, these three approaches detect significantly more
transcripts per cell as compared to the cells in our atlas:
CEL-Seq2 detects a median of 1,682 genes per cell and the
two SMART-Seq2 approaches detect 2,195–4,735 transcripts
per cell.
Using the regression model detailed above, we identified
cluster 61 as the single best match for each of the three
scRNA-seq techniques (Figure 2B). Immunofluorescence of the
R23E10-Gal4-labeled cells identified around 18 neurons (Fig-
ure 2A), whereas cluster 61 contains 232 cells. We therefore
hypothesized that cluster 61 may contain all dFB neurons,
including other dFB types not marked by R23E10-Gal4. Indeed,
when we subclustered cluster 61 using Seurat, we identified
seven subclusters, of which one single subcluster specifically
matched with the majority (66%) of the R23E10-Gal4-marked
single cells (Figures 2C and 2D). This indicates that our whole
brain dataset can be subclustered to high granularity and that
rare cell types are represented.
These results prompted us to investigate whether other Seurat
clusters also consisted of multiple neuronal subtypes. As
indicated above, the L1–L5 neuron bulk transcriptomes mapped
to cluster 20. To investigate whether we could discriminate
between these cell types, we subclustered cluster 20, allowing
us to identify five subclusters. Based on known markers, we

 identified two lamina monopolar cell types L1 (VGlut) (Kolod-
ziejczyk et al., 2008) and L4/L5 (bsh) (Hasegawa et al., 2013) (Fig-
ure 2E). In addition, the regression model was able to map L2 and
L3 to separate subclusters (Figure 2F). Previously two groups of
OPNs could be identified using scRNA-seq, adPNs, and lPNs
(Figure 2G) (Li et al., 2017). Utilizing the same strategy, we
subclustered our 543 OPN cells and were able to identify all
the subclusters reported by Li et al. (Figure 2H).
We next performed
subclustering
of the dopaminergic
neurons, known to form eight clusters in the adult Drosophila
central brain. Using Fer2 as a marker, we were able to distinguish
a cluster of protocerebral anterior-medial dopaminergic cells
(Figure 2I). Similarly, a cluster of Tdc2-positive cells could be
subclustered into two subclusters, representing the octopami-
nergic (Tbh positive) and tyraminergic (Tbh negative) neurons
(Figure 2J).
Another rare cell type in the brain are the peptidergic neurons.
We identified one major cell cluster containing peptidergic cells,
but since some other cell types also express neuropeptides, we
selected all cells containing at least 100 UMIs for any gene en-
coding a neuropeptide and re-clustered the resulting 1,269 cells.
This allowed us to identify multiple specific peptidergic neurons
such as the CCAP and gustatory Hug neurons from the subeso-
phageal ganglion (Figure 2K). We also identified a cluster
expressing Ilp2, Ilp3, and Ilp5, which are markers for the insu-
lin-producing cells (IPCs), as well as another cluster with Pdf-
expressing cells, which contain all but one neuron of the lateral
ventral neurons (LNvs), an important clock-neuron subtype
(Allada and Chung, 2010) (Figure 2K).
While we were able to produce subclusters for several
neuronal types, we also attempted to produce subclusters of
KCs that produce the three MB lobes. The subclustering indi-
cated that the cells separate based on technical factors such
as age and sex, and thus potential subtypes of the different lobes
could not be found (Figures S3G–S3I). This indicates that within
each lobe, the cells are transcriptionally very similar. Overall, we
identified most neuronal subtypes in the brain, with cell numbers
in each neuronal subtype corresponding to estimates reported in
literature (Figure 2L).
Mapping Cell-Type-Specific Regulatory Networks Using
SCENIC
Next, we asked whether the identified cell types are also charac-
terized by specific gene regulatory networks and the activities of
TF combinations. We therefore developed a Drosophila SCENIC
(Aibar et al., 2017) database and applied SCENIC to our data.
SCENIC identified 150 TFs (out of 708) with their recognition
motif significantly enriched in their co-expressed gene sets
(Table S4). Cell clustering using these gene networks, rather
than gene expression alone, resulted in a different t-SNE projec-
tion compared to Seurat (Figure 3A), although several TFs for
which regulons are found are also marker genes in Seurat
clusters (Figure S4C). In addition to cell-type-specific networks,
the overall pattern of the t-SNE suggests that large groups
of neurons have shared regulatory states. Particularly, along
the y axis of the t-SNE, cells are clustered by their neurotrans-
mitter type, each of which has unique combinations of TFs
predicted to regulate their identity (e.g., acj6 and ap for cholin-
ergic, fkh and svp for glutamergic, and croc and Lim3 for
GABAergic neurons) (Figure 3A).
Of all Seurat clusters, 50 form separate cell clusters in the
SCENIC t-SNE, suggesting that these cell types have the most
specific TF networks (Figure 3A; Data S1). For example, glial
cells are separated from neurons due to glial-specific activity
of the Repo and Pnt networks (Klaes et al., 1994; Xiong et al.,
1994). SCENIC also identified a TF network defining OPNs under
the control of C15, Hth, and Otp (Figure 3B). Among the
predicted C15 target genes are otp and kn, consistent with
subclustering of the OPN (Figure 3B). Also, multiple optic lobe
clusters have specific TF networks, such as the Mi1 neurons
under the control of Bsh (Hasegawa et al., 2011, 2013). In pepti-
dergic neurons, we identified a prominent network regulated by
Dimmed (Had�
zi�
c et al., 2015) (Figures 3C and S4B).
Although one purpose of this resource is to make the SCENIC
regulons available for further exploration through SCope, we
provide initial validation for several predicted networks. First,
we used gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of all regulons.
This confirmed, that the Dimm regulon with 111 predicted target
genes are significantly enriched for the GO term ‘‘neuropeptide
signaling pathway’’ (GO:0007218; FDR [false discovery rate]:
1.60 3 10�9), with strong target gene co-expression of 7B2,
ITP, Ms, Mip, and others (Figure S4B). Second, we compared
the predicted TFs with published phenotypes in the brain (Fig-
ure 3D), highlighting TFs whose loss of function cause neuronal
phenotypes, such as C15. Finally, we performed bulk assay for
transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) of
the brain to validate the predicted binding sites of TFs with
broad activity across many neuronal types. The strongest pan-
neuronal network was identified for Onecut. We checked
whether predicted Onecut binding sites reside in open chromatin
in the genome. Across four replicates, our data identified Onecut
sites to be strongly enriched for ATAC-seq signal (Figure 3E).
Interestingly, this analysis identified a significant DNA footprint
precisely overlapping the predicted Onecut motif (Figure 3E).
We confirmed that this signal was specific, and not due to back-
ground Tn5 specificity, by comparing high-scoring Onecut motif

 instances near random genes (Figures 3E and S4A). Together,
the SCENIC results provide a wide variety of regulatory predic-
tions, many of which match with neuronal subtypes, and they
can be explored through SCope.
Regulatory States in the Central Brain Are Predictive for
the Levels of Oxidative Phosphorylation
We further investigated the SCENIC t-SNE by exploring the
principal-component analysis (PCA) of the regulon activity ma-
trix. The first principal component (36% explained variance)
represents the neuron-glia axis with high loadings for Repo
and Pnt networks. The second principal component (13%) is
driven by the regulon of Dati (Schinaman et al., 2014) and to a
lesser extent by additional regulons of CG9650, Pdp1, and
Scro (Figure 4A). When we ran SCENIC searching for repressive
regulons, we identified additional Dati and Prospero (Pros) regu-
lons along this principal component (Figure S5A). These net-
works form a gradient along the x axis of the t-SNE (Figures
4B–4D and S5B). Among the predicted target genes of Pros
and Dati (Figure S5A), and expressed in distinct patterns along
the SCENIC t-SNE, are nearly all previously identified ‘‘master
regulators’’ of neuroblast development, including Imp, chinmo,
br, ab, Syp, mamo, ct, and Eip93F (Zhu et al., 2006; Maurange
et al., 2008; Syed et al., 2017). The enriched motif in the Dati
regulons is a peculiar AAAAAA motif also shared by other co-ex-
pressed factors including FoxP, jim, and hb (Figure S5C). Thus,
cell clustering based on inferred gene regulatory networks
groups neurons primarily according to their combinatorial
expression of key neuro-developmental factors.
To validate these predicted distinct neuronal states in the adult
brain, we chose Pros and Imp as markers and profiled their
protein expression in the brain using immunofluorescence (Fig-
ure 4E). This labeling confirmed that about half of the cells in
the central brain are Pros positive, while the other half are Imp
positive, and there is undetectable expression of either Pros or
Imp in the optic lobes. Based on the SCENIC regulons, and the
highly specific expression of master regulators, we can divide
all neurons in the brain into three categories: central brain A
(Dati and Pros), central brain B (Imp), and optic lobe (Scro)
(Figure 4F).
To explore whether this subdivision reflects a functional
difference, we assessed the differential gene expression profile
between the three neuronal groups, followed by GO enrichment
analysis. This revealed a highly significant upregulation of genes
involved in ATP metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation
(OxPhos) (padj < 1.00 3 10�40) in the optic lobes and central
brain B, compared to central brain A (Figure 4G). This difference
is recapitulated by a significantly higher number of mitochondrial
reads in central brain B (Figure 4H). Furthermore, the upregu-
lated genes in central brain B are significantly enriched for an
ATF-like motif TTAcgTAA, previously reported as the ‘‘OxPhos
motif’’ (Porcelli et al., 2007) (Figure 4I). Assessing the expression
of glycolysis-related genes revealed upregulation of these genes
in glia and optic lobe cells (Figure S5D).
To further investigate OxPhos gene expression levels, we
scored each Seurat cluster with an independent set of curated
OxPhos genes (Porcelli et al., 2007) (Figure 4J). We confirmed
that glial clusters are the lowest in OxPhos gene expression
levels, and we also observe this in single-cell datasets of hu-
man brains (Figure S6A). MB neurons are overall low in Ox-
Phos gene expression, with the a0/b0 KCs slightly higher
than the other two lobes. The dFB neurons that we identified
above (Seurat cluster 61) display very high OxPhos gene
expression.
These differences in OxPhos gene expression may correlate
with variations in mitochondrial activity and turnover. To test
this in vivo, we turned to the mitoTimer assay (Ferree et al.,
2013). We compared the ratio of newly synthesized and mature
mitochondrial proteins in KCs, PDF neurons, R23E10-Gal4 dFB
neurons, and GH146-targeted OPNs (Figures 4K and 4L). The
analysis confirmed that R23E10-Gal4 dFB neurons have a
significantly higher mitochondrial turnover than KCs and that
among the KCs, the a0/b0 are higher in mitochondrial turnover
than the other two MB lobes, in agreement with their levels of
OxPhos gene expression. The PDF neurons show intermediate
OxPhos gene expression levels from the scRNA-seq data
and also show intermediate mitochondrial turnover in vivo
(Figure 4L).
Together, these data indicate that neurons in the central brain
show differential regulatory networks of TFs (e.g., pros, dati,
mamo, hb, chinmo, pdm3) and RNA-binding proteins (Imp,
Syp) and that specific combinations of these TFs are predictive
for the levels of expression of genes involved in oxidative
phosphorylation.

 Aging Affects Transcriptional Output, Mitochondrial
Turnover, and Cell Size
We found very few age-related biases in the cell-type clus-
tering of Seurat and SCENIC when using normalized data (to
the total UMI count of a given cell). When we investigated
the raw read counts, we found an exponential decline in the
number of UMIs and the number of genes expressed during
aging (R2 = 0.907 for DGRP-551 and 0.840 for w1118) (Fig-
ure 5A) in agreement with prior observations (Tahoe et al.,
2004). This effect can be observed in all neuronal and glial
cell types (Figures S7A and S7B). The decline of total RNA
does not appear to affect cellular identity, as illustrated by
the consistent cell-type clustering in both young and old brains
(Figure 5B) and the fact that aging is rarely (except in glial cells)
the major correlate to Destiny-derived diffusion components
(Angerer et al., 2016) (Figure S7C). However, while all cell types
are retained in old brains, there is a slight change in cell
composition of old brains, as shown by a relative increase of
glia, reminiscent of human brain aging (Soreq et al., 2017)
(Figure 5B).
Next, to assess whether all genes were equally affected by this
decline, we calculated the correlation of each gene with age and
found a subset of genes that show only a marginal decline in
gene expression levels (Figure 5C). These genes are strongly
enriched for genes related to the ribosome. A single gene,
namely stubarista (sta), encoding a ribosomal subunit protein,
is upregulated during aging. In contrast, genes that decline faster
than average are strongly enriched for those involved in oxidative
phosphorylation. Above, oxidative phosphorylation was used to
demarcate the brain into three sub-compartments. Therefore,
we checked whether the decline in oxidative phosphorylation
was caused by the aging of one of these groups; however, all
groups show a similar decline of oxidative phosphorylation, sug-
gesting a general effect on aging (Figure 5D).
To validate the strong decline in OxPhos gene expression
levels during aging, we again used the in vivo mitoTimer assay,
comparing young (3 days) versus old (45 days) brains. We found
a significant decrease in mitochondrial turnover in old brains
across cell types (Figures 6A and 6B). Since these experiments
were performed on non-fixed brains, this allowed us to

 simultaneously compare the size of neurons between young and
old brains. Cell size decreases during aging (Figure 6C), in agree-
ment with the decline in mRNA content.
To test whether cellular age can be predicted from our data,
we trained a Random Forest regression model (see STAR
Methods). When applied to each Seurat cluster, we found that
the accuracy of age prediction varies between cell types and is
concordant with the overall correlation of gene expression (indi-
cated by the correlation with a Destiny diffusion component)
(Figures 6D and S7E). Interestingly, mt:lrRNA, was found consis-
tently as the most important feature to predict cellular age.
Applying and testing this model to all cells yielded very accurate
age predictions (Figure 6E). The most informative genes include
mt:lrRNA, Hsromega, TM4SF, and sta, which all show different
aging dynamics (Figure 6F).
In conclusion, aging affects mRNA abundance; however, cell
identity remains intact. Genes involved in oxidative phosphoryla-
tion and mitochondrial turnover decline most rapidly, and
mitochondrial translation-related genes are accurate predictors
of cellular age.
SCope: Cloud-Based Exploration of Single-Cell Atlases
The single-cell atlas of the Drosophila brain, as presented
here, is available through a user-friendly online application
called SCope (http://scope.aertslab.org). SCope can also be
easily installed on a local computer, server, or cloud-based
infrastructure using a Singularity container (Kurtzer et al.,
2017). SCope utilizes data stored in a loom format (https://
github.com/linnarsson-lab/loompy), a HDF5-based data file
that contains a raw or normalized gene expression matrix
for a dataset with t-SNE coordinates but can contain extra
annotation and features from different analyses and tools,
such as Seurat clusters and SCENIC regulons (Figure 7A).
Several single-cell datasets are already provided in SCope,
including this study, the Drosophila optic lobe (Konstantinides
et al., 2018), OPNs (Li et al., 2017) and embryo (Karaiskos
et al., 2017), the mouse brain cells (Zeisel et al., 2015) and
hypothalamus (Chen et al., 2017), and the human brain cells
(Lake et al., 2018). In addition, users can also upload their
own .loom files.
Data can be visualized as colored projections onto different
embeddings or co-ordinates (such as PCA/t-SNE/DC). Different
analyses are available such as simultaneous display of up to
three genes, with optional log and CPM normalizations, simulta-
neous exploration of up to three SCENIC regulons including
manual thresholding, and visualization of TF expression levels.
Datasets can be compared within dataset; between annotations
such as genotype, replicate, or age; and between dataset,
including cross-species plotting of orthologous genes (Figures
7B and S6). Finally, gene sets can be provided that are scored
with AUCell (Aibar et al., 2017) to visualize which cells are en-
riched for the gene set. In sum, SCope provides comprehensive
access and allows exploration of gene expression and gene
regulatory analyses from large-scale single-cell datasets in a
fast, easy-to-use interface.
DISCUSSION
In this work, we report a comprehensive single-cell compendium
of
an
entire
intact
adult
brain
during
aging.
Single-cell
sequencing technology is revolutionizing the identification of
cell types and of shared regulatory states. Brain research bene-
fits enormously from the emergence of single-cell technologies,
as the complex structure makes it difficult to decipher genome-
wide transcriptome data using bulk techniques. We identify
numerous cellular subclusters and state changes, each defined
either by gene expression markers, gene signatures, transcrip-
tion factor expression, or regulons. This work will facilitate future
work on the fly brain and serve as a resource to understand cell-
type identity.
Our work overcame a number of technical hurdles such as the
small size of the fly neurons and the lower RNA content in aged
animals. Despite these hurdles, we have shown that our dataset
includes single-cell transcriptomes for nearly all cell types in the
fly brain. Indeed, we were able to map transcriptome data of

 specific FAC-sorted cells to specific clusters in our whole brain
dataset. Further subclustering of the primary clusters typically
led to the identification of additional known cell types, such
as the R23E10-Gal4 dFB neurons, suggesting that hundreds
of neural subtypes exist (231–1,190 subclusters depending
on the resolution parameter). Nevertheless, not all clusters
have an outspoken identity, such as the relatively large
clusters of ‘‘generic’’ neurons in the center of our Seurat t-SNE
(Figure 1).
By sequencing the transcriptome of individual cells, we can
now measure the output of the regulatory system without the
loss of information caused by the signal averaging from bulk
technologies. We recently showed that transcription factor sub-
networks that are active in specific cell types can be predicted by
combining scRNA-seq with the cis-regulatory sequence infor-
mation contained within the enhancers of regulated genes (Aibar
et al., 2017). Here, we developed SCENIC for the Drosophila
genome, and by applying it to our data, we identified regulatory
variability among neurons along several different axes, such as
presynaptic specialization, neuronal subtypes, and combina-
tions of neuronal master regulators such as Imp, pros, dati,
mamo, and br (Maurange et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2015; Syed
et al., 2017).
What emerged from the contrast between pros/dati-positive
and Imp-positive neurons are highly significant differences
in expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways
related to oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting more active
mitochondria in Imp-positive neurons, throughout the entire
central brain. Given that markers of these central brain neu-
rons, such as pros, dati, mamo, and Imp, are expressed in
temporal windows during neuronal birth (Maurange et al.,
2008; Li et al., 2013), one possibility may be that neurons
are endowed with a particular metabolic potential when
they are born. Such a regulatory state could then influence
how neuronal networks are constructed during development
and how they function during life, but more work is needed
to explore this possibility.
Our work is, to our knowledge, the first to examine the aging
process at single-cell level in the brain. Aging has long been
associated with epigenomic changes (O’Sullivan and Karl-
seder, 2012) and increased transcriptional heterogeneity (Mar-
tinez-Jimenez et al., 2017). However, it remains unclear
whether there is an aging mechanism common to all cell types.
Unsupervised clustering and trajectory analysis of neuronal
transcriptomes
do
not
reveal
a
strong
age
component.
Instead, neuronal subtypes cluster together across all ages,
indicating that cell fate is robustly maintained in aging cells.
We furthermore conclude that aging mechanisms are cell-
type specific, since glial cells, but not neurons, show a clear
aging trajectory in their transcriptional profile. In addition, an
exponential
decline
in
gene
expression
correlates
with
neuronal shrinking.
Only
ribosomal
genes
withstand
this
decline, while genes encoding OxPhos components decline
most rapidly. Ribosomal genes are controlled by a special
type of core promoter, the TCT promoter (Parry et al., 2010),
which
may
explain
why
ribosomal
gene
expression
is
uniquely regulated during aging. Since the exact mechanism
of mRNA decline remains to be identified, our work may
provide interesting starting points to start unraveling this
mechanism.
Single-cell datasets are being generated at a rapid pace,
across different species (Regev et al., 2017). New software
enabling the easy exploration and comparison of these data
will be essential to make these atlases available to the wider
scientific community, allowing researchers to investigate cell
types, identify markers relevant to their own research, and
compare features across datasets and across species. SCope
provides a platform to easily and rapidly explore large-scale
single-cell datasets without the need for the researcher to
acquire and analyze raw data. In addition, leveraging a standard-
ized file format, new datasets and analyses can easily be
investigated using SCope, and the provided containers make
it easy for groups and institutions to deploy this platform
using their own servers or cloud-computing solutions.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Fly Stocks
All flies were raised on a yeast based medium and kept at 25�C on a 12h/12h day/night light cycle. During aging experiments,
20 females and 10 males were placed in each vial and flies were transferred to new vials every 4 days. Adult flies were used at
ages 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 15, 30 and 50 days old.
Please see the Key Resources Table for the Drosophila lines used in this study.
METHOD DETAILS
Brain dissociation into single cells
Forty D. melanogaster adult brains (20 females and 20 males) were dissected and transferred to a tube containing 100 ml ice
cold DPBS solution. After centrifugation at 800 xg for 5 min, the supernatant was replaced by 50 mL of dispase (3 mg/mL, Sigma-
Aldrich_D4818-2mg) and 75 ml collagenase I (100 mg/mL, Invitrogen_17100-017), a shorter variant of the dissociation included
125 mL trypsin-EDTA (0.05%, Invitrogen_25300054). Brains were dissociated at 25�C in a Thermoshaker (Grant Bio PCMT) for 2h
at 25�C, 500 rpm or 15 min at 25�C, 1,000 rpm for the short dissociation. The enzymatic reaction was reinforced by pipette mixing
every 15 min or 5 min for the short dissociation. Cells were washed with 1,000 ml ice cold DPBS solution and resuspended in 400 ml
DPBS 0.01% BSA (for Drop-seq experiments) or DPBS 0.04% BSA (for 10x experiments) for 30-40 brains. Cell suspensions were
passed through a 10 mM pluriStrainer (ImTec Diagnostics_435001050). Cell viability and concentration were assessed by the
LUNA-FL Dual Fluorescence Cell Counter.
10x Genomics
Single-cell libraries were generated using the GemCode Single-Cell Instrument and Single Cell 30 Library & Gel Bead Kit v2 and Chip
Kit (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, fly brain single cells were suspended in 0.04% BSA–PBS. About
8,700 cells were added to each channel with a targeted cell recovery estimate of 5,000 cells. After generation of nanoliter-scale Gel
bead-in-EMulsions (GEMs), GEMs were reverse transcribed in a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio Rad) programed at 53�C for
45 min, 85�C for 5 min, and hold at 4�C. After reverse transcription, single-cell droplets were broken and the single-strand cDNA
was isolated and cleaned with Cleanup Mix containing DynaBeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was then amplified with a
C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler programed at 98�C for 3 min, 12 cycles of (98�C for 15 s, 67�C for 20 s, 72�C for 1 min), 72�C for
1 min, and held at 4�C twice. Subsequently, the amplified cDNA was fragmented, end-repaired, A-tailed and index adaptor ligated,
with SPRIselect Reagent Kit (Beckman Coulter) with cleanup in between steps. Post-ligation product was amplified with a C1000
Touch Thermal Cycler programed at 98�C for 45 s, 14 cycles of (98�C for 20 s, 54�C for 30 s, 72�C for 20 s), 72�C for 1 min, and
hold at 4�C. The sequencing-ready library was cleaned up with SPRIselect beads.
Immunofluorescence
For immunofluorescence, brains were dissected and transferred to a tube containing 100 ml ice cold DPBS solution. After centrifu-
gation at 800 xg for 5 min, the supernatant was replaced by 4% Formaldehyde in PBT 0.3% (DBPS + 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma)) and

 incubated at room temperature with rotation for 15 min. Brains were washed with PBT 0.3% three times, rotating for 10 min at room
temperature each time and then blocked in Pax-DG (10 g BSA (Sigma), 3g Deoxycholate Acid (Sigma), 3ml Triton X-100 (Sigma), 50ml
Normal Goat Serum (MP Biomedicals), 100ml 10X PBS, 850ml H2O) for 2 hours at room temperature with rotation. Primary antibody
mixes were created in Pax-DG (dilutions detailed in the Key Resources Table) and brains were incubated in these mixes overnight at
4�C with rotation. The next day, brains were washed with PBT 0.3% three times, rotating for 10 min at room temperature each time
and then stained with secondary antibody mixes in Pax-DG (dilutions detailed in the Key Resources Table) for 2 hours at room tem-
perature with rotation. Brains were washed with PBT 0.3% three times, rotating for 10 min at room temperature each time and
mounted in Mowiol mounting medium (Sigma). Imaging was performed using the Leica TCS SP5 and Nikon Spinning Disk confocal
microscopes.
Whole brain ATAC-seq
Two brains (one male, one female) were dissected and transferred to a tube containing 100 ml ice cold DPBS solution. After centri-
fugation at 800 xg for 5 min, the supernatant was replaced with 50 mL ice cold ATAC-seq lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10mM NaCl,
3mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630) and the brains were mixed harshly by pipetting. Lysed brains were then centrifuged at 800 xg for
10 min and the supernatant was discarded and replaced with 50 ml ATAC-seq reaction mix (2.5 ml Nextera Tn5 (Illumina), 25ml Nextera
TD Buffer (Illumina), 22.5 ml H2O) and incubated at 37�C for 30 min. Transposed DNA was purified using a QIAGEN MinElute purifi-
cation column and amplified for 5 cycles (10 ml purified DNA, 25 ml NEBNext High Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB), 2.5 ml Nextera
compatible FWD primer (Table S5), 2.5 ml Nextera compatible REV primer (Table S5), 10 ml H2O) with the following PCR conditions:
72�C for 5 min, 98�C for 30 s, followed by 5 cycles of at 98�C for 10 s, 63�C for 30 s and 72�C for 1 min. After 5 cycles, qPCR was
performed on 5 ml of the PCR mix (5 ml PCR Mix, 10 ml 2x SYBR Green I MasterMix (Roche), 2 ml Nextera compatible FWD primer, 2 ml
Nextera compatible REV primer, 1 ml H2O – split across two wells) for 40 cycles. For each sample, the number of cycles at which ¼ the
maximum qPCR fluorescent intensity was achieved was noted. The remaining 45 ml PCR was further cycled as described for this
number of cycles. Final libraries were purified using a QIAGEN MinElute column and then a 1.2x AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman
Coulter) using manufacturers recommendation.
Nuclei Prep
Nuclei were isolated by using the EZ nuclei isolation kit (Sigma). Briefly, 40 Drosophila adult brains (20 females and 20 males) were
dissected in ice cold PBS and transferred to a Dounce homogenizer containing 2 mL of ice-cold Nuclei EZ lysis buffer and incubated
on ice for 5 min. The tissue was disrupted by 25 strokes with the loose pestle, incubated on ice for 10 min and disrupted by 40 strokes
with the tight pestle. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 500 xg for 5 min at 4�C, washed with 4 mL of ice-cold Nuclei EZ lysis
buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation, the nuclei preps were washed again in 4 mL of Nuclei Suspension Buffer
(NSB; consisting of 1x PBS, 0.01% BSA and 0.1% RNase inhibitor (Clontech, 2313A)) and filtered through a 35 mm cell strainer
(Corning, Cat# 352235). After centrifugation, supernatant was removed and isolated nuclei were lysed using 200 ml of lysis buffer
for RNA extraction.
Bulk RNA-seq
Twenty to thirty adult brains were dissected in PBS and total RNA was extracted according to the RNAqueous micro protocol
(Ambion), using 200 ml lysis buffer. Two different methods were applied to prepare RNA-seq libraries.
For the Tn5-mediated, unstranded RNA-seq library prep, mRNA was enriched using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit
(Invitrogen). To make cDNA, 1 ml of oligo(dT) primers (500ng/ml; Ambion) and 1 ml of 10 mM dNTP (Promega) was added to 10 ml
of polyA-selected mRNA; incubated at 65�C for 5 min and placed on ice. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed by adding
4ml of first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2 ml of 100 mM DTT (Invitrogen) and 2 ml of Superscript II (Invitrogen) and incubating the mix
at 42�C for 50 min, then 70�C for 15 min. The second strand of cDNA was filled in by adding 35 ml of water, 15 ml of 5x second strand
buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5 ml of 10 mM dNTP, 0.5 ml of 10 U/ml E Coli DNA ligase (Bioke), 2 ml of 10 U/ml E Coli DNA polymerase I (Bioke),
1 ml of 2 U/ml E Coli RNaseH and then incubating at 16�C for 2 hours. The cDNA was purified on a MinElute column (QIAGEN) and
eluted in 15 ml EB buffer. To incorporate sequencing adapters, we combined the purified cDNA with 4 ml of Nextera TD buffer (Illumina)
and 1 ml of Nextera Tn5 enzyme (Illumina) on ice and incubated at 55�C for 5 min. The tagmented cDNA was purified again on a
MinElute column and eluted in 20 ml EB buffer. To PCR amplify the fragments, we added 25 ml of NEBnext PCR master mix (Bioke),
5 ml of Nextera primer mix and incubated at 72�C for 5 min, then at 98�C for 30 s, followed by 15 cycles of 98�C for 10 s, 63�C for 30 s
and 72�C for 3 min. We purified the PCR amplicons with 55 ml AMPure beads (Analis).
The stranded RNA-seq libraries were prepared according to the Illumina Truseq stranded mRNA sample preparation guide.
SMART-Seq2
Cells were directly sorted into the 96 wells plate containing 4 ml lysis buffer mix (2 ml lysis buffer, 1 ml 10mM biotinylated Oligo-dT30VN
and 1 ml dNTP mix). After vortexing and centrifugation, samples were incubated at 72�C for 3 min and put on ice. Reverse transcrip-
tion was carried out by adding 5.7 ml of RT mix: 100U SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen), 10U RNase Inhibitor (Invitrogen), SSII buffer
(Invitrogen), 5 mM DTT, 1M Betaine, 6 mM MgCl2, 1uM TSO-LNA (QIAGEN) and nuclease free water. The RT was carried out on
a thermo-block: 42�C for 90 min; 11 cycles of (50�C for 2 min; 42�C for 2 min); 70�C for 90 min. After the template switching RT,
e4
Cell 174, 982–998.e1–e9, August 9, 2018
 the individual cell libraries were subjected to IS PCR with 12.5 ml of KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (2X; Roche), 10 mM biotinylated IS
PCR primer (IDT) and nuclease free water. 26 cycles of following IS-PCR program was used for library amplification: 98�C for 90 min;
11 cycles of (50�C for 2 min; 42�C for 2 min); 70�C for 90 min; 26 cycles of (98�C for 20 s; 67�C for 15 s; 72�C for 6 min); 72�C for 5 min.
Individual cell libraries were purified using Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) using manufacturers recommendation. The libraries
were eluted in 17.5 ml of EB buffer. Quality checks and library quantifications were performed on few samples using BioAnalyzer
(Agilent) and Qbit (Thermo). Tagmentation reaction was performed based on the manufacturers protocol, with the following modifi-
cations: The tagmentation mix of the library was prepared with 2.5 ml of Nextera TD buffer (Illumina), 1.25 ml of cDNA (0.2 ng/ml, based
on the average concentration of the libraries) and 1.25 ml of Nextera Tn5 Transposase (Illumina). Tagmentation was carried out at
55�C for 5 min and immediately the Tn5 was inactivated using NT buffer (Illumina). For the final enrichment PCR, the following
was added to the individual libraries: 1.25 ml of individual barcoded sequencing adaptors and 3.75 ml of Nextera PCR master mix
(Illumina). The following program was used for the enrichment PCR: 72�C for 3 min; 95�C for 30 s; 15 cycles of (95�C for 10 s;
55�C for 30 s; 72�C for 30 s); 72�C for 5 min. Final purification of enriched libraries was performed using Ampure XP beads (0.6x)
as per manufacturers recommendations. Additional quality assessment was performed using BioAnalyzer and Qubit. Final libraries
had a size distribution of 300-900 bps.
Adapted SMART-Seq2
Cells were sorted into 2.5 ml RLT Plus lysis buffer (QIAGEN) and supplemented with a 1:1,000M dilution of ERCC spike-in mixture A
(Life Technologies). Polyadenylated mRNA was captured by adding 10 ml of biotinylated Oligo-dT30VN primer conjugated to
streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Life Technologies) and collected to the side of the well using a magnet. The
supernatant was removed and the beads were washed four times in a wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 0.5% Tween 20, 0,05x SUPERasin (Life Technologies)). Subsequently 5 ml of Reverse Transcription mastermix
(10 U/ml SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies), 0.5 U/ml SUPERasin, 1x Superscript II First-Strand Buffer (Life
Technologies), 5mM DTT (Life Technologies), 1M betaine (Sigma), 6mM MgCl2 (Life Technologies), 1mM Template-Switching Oligo,
1 mM dNTP mix (Thermo Scientific)) was added to the dried beads and incubated for 60 min at 42�C, 30 min at 50�C and 10 min at
60�C on a Thermomixer with mixing. Finally, PCR mastermix (1x KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix and 0,1mM IS PCR primer) was added
and thermal cycled for 3 min at 98�C, 24 cycles of 98�C for 15 s, 67�C for 20 s and 72�C for 6 min and finally 72�C for 5 min. Amplified
cDNA was cleaned using a 0.8x ratio of CleanPCR beads (NAClean) and eluted in 25 ml EB elution buffer. Tagmentation and library
prep was performed as mentioned above (SMART-Seq2)
CEL-Seq2
Cells were sorted into wells containing 1.2 ml primer mix (0.2 ml barcoded primer (IDT), 0.1 ml 10mM dNTPs (Life Technologies), 0.9 ml
H2O). After sorting, plates were spun and stored at �80�C. RNA was annealed by incubating 5 min at 65�C. RT mix (0.4 ml Superscript
II First-Strand Buffer (Life Technologies), 0.2 ml 0.1 M DTT (Life Technologies), 0.1 ml RNaseOUT (Life Technologies), 0.1 ml
SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies)) was added and incubated at 42�C for 1 hour and then 70�C for 10 min. Plates
were allowed to cool to < 16�C and 10 ml Second strand synthesis mix was then added (H2O 7 ml, 2.31 mL Superscript II First-Strand
Buffer (Life Technologies), 0.23 mL 10mM dNTPs (Life Technologies), 0.08 ml DNA Ligase (Life Technologies), 0.3 mL E. coli DNA Po-
lymerase (Life Technologies), 0.08 mL RNaseH (Life Technologies)) and incubated at 16�C for 2 hours. Samples with unique barcodes
were pooled and cDNA was cleaned using a 1.2x ratio of AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter) and beads were resuspended in 6.4 ml
H2O. IVT mix was added (1.6 ml d(A/C/G/T)TPs, 1.6 ml T7 Buffer, 1.6 ml T7 enzyme (Ambion), and incubated overnight at 37�C.
ExoSAP, 6 ml (Agilent) was added and incubated at 37�C for 15 min. RNA was then fragmented by adding 5.5 ml fragmentation buffer
(200mM Tris-acetate (Sigma), pH 8.1, 500 mM KOAc (Sigma), 150 mM MgOAc (Sigma)). Ampure beads were removed and RNA was
cleaned using RNAclean XP beads (Beckman Coulter) at 1.8x ratio and eluted in 7 ml H2O. Libraries were prepped by first performing
RT (2 ml Superscript II First-Strand Buffer (Life Technologies), 1 ml 0.1M DTT (Life Technologies), 0.5 ml RNaseOUT (Life Technologies),
0.5 ml SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies)) and incubating at 25�C for 10 min and 42�C for 1 hour. Finally, PCR
mastermix (25 ml NEBNext Mastermix (NEB), 11 ml H2O and 2 ml P5 Nextera primer) was added and thermal cycled for 30 s at
98�C, 11 cycles of 98�C for 10 s, 60�C for 30 s and 72�C for 30 s and finally 72�C for 10 min. Amplified cDNA was cleaned using
a 0.8x ratio of AMPureXP beads and eluted in 25 ml EB H2O.
MitoTimer and cell size
Flies were homozygous (GH146-Gal4) or heterozygous (all other) for the Gal4 driver and UAS-mitoTimer (Laker et al., 2014). They
were raised in mixed populations of �20 flies at 25�C in 12h/12h day/night light cycle conditions, and flies of different ages were
assayed the same day side by side. The brains were dissected in ice-cold PBS and imaged immediately (without fixation), using a
Nikon widefield microscope equipped with a 20x/0.75NA water immersion objective and GFP and dsRed emission filters. The
acquisition settings were kept the same for all brains of one genotype, and the same exposure times were used for both channels.
For each defined fluorescent soma (or lobe region for the mushroom body/OK107-Gal4), size and average red and green fluores-
cence were determined using Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012). Background was subtracted from fluorescent values, and the ratio of green
and red fluorescent mitoTimer was calculated for each soma (value green/(value red + value green)*100). To compare single channel
Cell 174, 982–998.e1–e9, August 9, 2018
e5
 intensities per cell, values were normalized to the cell’s size. For display, all images across one genotype and fluorescence color are
scaled equally. Mushroom body beta prime lobes were not analyzed, as they could not be distinguished unambiguously.
High-throughput sequencing
Before sequencing, the fragment size of every library was analyzed on a Bioanalyzer high sensitivity chip. The libraries were diluted to
2 nM and quantified by qPCR using primers against p5-p7 sequence. All 10x libraries were sequenced on HiSeq4000 and
NextSeq500 instruments (Illumina) with following sequencing parameters: 26 bp read 1 – 8 bp index 1 (i7) – 88 bp read 2. All
CEL-Seq2 libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq instrument (Illumina). Custom primers for index read 1 and read 2 were added
to the Illumina sequencing primers. The following sequencing parameters were used: 51 bp read 1 – 6 bp index 1 (i7) – 8 bp index
2 (i5) – 26 bp read 2. SMART-Seq2 libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq4000, the following sequencing parameters were used:
51 bp read 1 – 8 bp index 1 (i7) – 8 bp index 2 (i5).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Raw Datasets
The 10x fly brain samples were each processed (alignment, barcode assignment and UMI counting) with Cell Ranger (version 2.0.0)
count pipeline. The Cell Ranger reference index was built upon the 3rd 2017 FlyBase release (D. melanogaster r6.16) (Gramates et al.,
2017). Median saturation was calculated as the median of the Sequencing Saturation metric reported by the CellRanger software.
10x Data Preprocessing
All samples but the ones with short dissociation protocol (SDP) were selected to build the high-quality datasets. The –recovered-cells
parameter was specified for each Cell Ranger run with the number of cells that we expected to recover for each individual single-
library (Table S1). Therefore, the number of cells in each sample was estimated by the Cell Ranger cell detection algorithm. The final
raw DGRP-551 dataset was built by aggregating all the DGRP-551 samples using Cell Ranger aggregation pipeline without applying
any Cell Ranger normalization method. The final raw w1118 dataset was built in the same way as the DGRP-551 dataset. Final dimen-
sions of the raw DGRP-551 and w1118 datasets are 17,473 by 32,277, and 17,473 genes by 31,951 cells, respectively.
A large dataset of 157,390 cells (all samples in Table S1) was generated using a custom method to select the cells, less stringent
than the one from Cell Ranger (Figure S1G). A common technique to discriminate cell-associated barcodes and the barcodes asso-
ciated with empty partitions is to plot the cumulative fraction of reads/UMIs for all barcodes and look at its ‘‘knee.’’ The true cell
barcodes would be assigned to the barcodes below the cut-off defined by the location of the knee. A new method was used to detect
this ‘‘knee.’’ This method is based on the 10x publicly available dataset 1:1 mixture of fresh frozen human (HEK293T) and mouse (NIH
3T3) cells. The total UMIs associated to each raw barcode was computed per species and this was used to plot the cumulative frac-
tion of UMIs plot for all barcodes. Each barcode is considered as a mixed cell if less than 95% of the UMIs are not associated to one of
the 2 species. With this, the cumulative fraction of mixed cells was computed. This number is almost flat for first top barcodes but
then starts to grow linearly. A linear model was fitted through the linear part of the cumulative fraction of mixed cells (25,000th to
50,000th barcode). The fitted model intersected the x axis at �12,419 which is very close to the expected number of cells (12k). A
spline was fitted to the cumulative fraction of UMIs in order to find the tangent at this intercept. The angle of the tangent was then
used as cut-off for each single-library dataset to discriminate the true cell barcodes from the empty partitions.
Cell Ranger uses a cell detection algorithm to discriminate true cell barcodes from empty partitions. To clean the data further, qual-
ity control and filtering based on scater (McCarthy et al., 2017) applied on each dataset. Genes not expressed in any cells were
removed, leaving 13,991 genes for the DGRP-551 dataset and 13,581 for the w1118 dataset. Then, a principal component analysis
(PCA) based on quality metrics (calculated by the scater R-package was performed for each cell. If the cell’s metrics deviated
more than 5 absolute deviations from the median, the cell was flagged as an outlier. The number of cells passing the quality controls
are 29,137 and 27,765 respectively for DGRP-551 and w1118. Finally, low-abundance genes, defined as those with an average count
below a filter threshold of 0.001 were removed. Dimensions of the final preprocessed DGRP-551 and w1118 datasets are 9,461 genes
by 29,137 cells, and 9,349 genes by 27,765 cells, respectively.
SMART-Seq2 and CEL-Seq2 Data Processing
Reads were first cleaned for adapters using fastq-mcf. (Aronesty, 2011) and a list of sequencing primers. Multiplexed CEL-Seq2 cells
were demultiplexed with custom scripts utilizing pysam (Li et al., 2009). Cleaned reads were then mapped to the 3rd 2017 FlyBase
release (D. melanogaster r6.16) genome using STAR with default parameters. Reads were counted per gene using featureCounts. For
data analysis, only cells with a total number of reads higher than 10,000 (CEL-Seq2) or 20,000 (SMART-Seq2) were used.
ATAC-seq Data Processing
ATAC-seq reads were first cleaned for adapters using fastq-mcf. (Aronesty, 2011) and a list of sequencing primers. Cleaned reads
were then mapped to the 3rd 2017 FlyBase release (D. melanogaster r6.16) genome using STAR with the following additional
e6
Cell 174, 982–998.e1–e9, August 9, 2018
 options:–alignIntronMax 1–alignIntronMin 2. Peaks were called on mapped reads using macs2 (Feng et al., 2011) with the following
additional options:–nomodel–call-summits. Aggregation plots were produced using in-house scripts available at: https://github.
com/aertslab/ATAC-seq-analysis.
RNA-seq Data Processing
RNA-seq reads were first cleaned for adapters using fastq-mcf. (Aronesty, 2011) and a list of sequencing primers. Cleaned reads
were then mapped to the 3rd 2017 FlyBase release (D. melanogaster r6.16) genome using STAR with default parameters. Reads
were counted per gene using featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014). Differential analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014).
Seurat
The Seurat pipeline was executed on a combined dataset of DGRP-551 and w1118 (Satija et al., 2015). First, cells were selected from
the preprocessed files of each genotype and a matrix was constructed with all genes. Then the scater R-package was used to select
genes as previously described. This matrix was then used as input for Seurat. Next, the data were log-normalized with a scale factor
of 104. The latent variables, defined as the number of UMI and the percentage of mitochondrial reads per cell, were regressed
out using a negative binomial model. For further downstream analysis, the most variable genes (937) were selected using
FindVariableGenes (Seurat R package) with default parameters. The graph-based method from Seurat was used to cluster cells.
The PCA was selected as dimensional reduction technique to use in construction of Shared Nearest-Neighbor (SNN) graph. In order
to select the number of PCs as input into the clustering algorithm, we performed a cross-validation step which lead us to select the
first 82 PCs. These 82 PCs were then used in an SSN clustering, with different settings for the resolution parameter, between 2.0 and
8.0, leading to 87-151 clusters. We identified markers specific to each cluster and calculated differential expression, using the default
parameters and the bimod model (McDavid et al., 2013). A t-SNE clustering was performed on the scaled matrix (with most variable
genes only) to obtain a two-dimensional representation of the cell states. Finally, perplexity value of 30 and 82 PCs were picked for the
final Seurat t-SNE.
SCENIC fly database
SCENIC was run as described in (Aibar et al., 2017). For this study, we created the motif databases that allow to use RcisTarget and
SCENIC on Drosophila (dm6, gene names from FlyBase version FB2016_05). We scored the 20,003 motifs (Position Weight Matrices)
in v8 of the i-cisTarget (Imrichova
´ et al., 2015) database on the regulatory regions up to 5KB upstream of each gene and within its
introns. The gene-motif rankings were then built taking the best-scoring region for each motif and gene. These databases are
made available for download to use with RcisTarget.
SCENIC on DGRP-551 dataset
SCENIC was applied on the DGRP-551 dataset after removing genes that were not present in our dm6 motifs ranking database. The
input UMI count matrix was normalized (CPM) and log-transformed using edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) with prior of 1. Targets genes
that did not show a positive correlation based on the GENIE3 (Huynh-Thu et al., 2010) co-expression algorithm (> 0.03) in each
TF-module were filtered out. After removing TF-modules having less than 20 genes, SCENIC found 3,064 TF-modules. A cis-regu-
latory motif analysis on each of the TF-modules with RcisTarget revealed 150 regulons (each with at least 10 targets genes). The top 1
percentile of the number of detected genes per cell was used to calculate the AUCell enrichment of each regulon in each cell. We
performed a t-SNE clustering on the regulon AUC matrix to obtain a two-dimensional representation of the cell states.
Regulons which showed negative correlation (< 0.03) of their target genes with the corresponding TF were also assessed in the
same way as for the ‘‘positively correlated regulons.’’ This way, we found 13 additional regulons.
SCENIC on w1118 dataset
The w1118 dataset was used to validate the regulons obtained from the DGRP-551 dataset. Specifically, all the filtered w1118 cells
were scored through AUCell (Aibar et al., 2017) on the DGRP-551 regulons. A t-SNE clustering was then applied similarly as for
DGRP-551 dataset.
SCENIC on DGRP-551 and w1118 high quality dataset
All 56,902 cells originating from the two preprocessed datasets (DGRP-551 and w1118) were rescored on the regulons found in
the DGRP-551 dataset using AUCell. The two-dimensional representation of the cell states for the combined dataset were
computed using the t-SNE clustering algorithm on the regulon AUC matrix. A perplexity value of 60 and a number of PCs of 25
were selected for the SCENIC t-SNE. This same method was applied for the large dataset (less stringent filtering) containing
157,390 cells.
Cell 174, 982–998.e1–e9, August 9, 2018
e7
 SCENIC on DGRP-551 and w1118 large dataset
Since GENIE3 does not scale well with the number of cells, GRNBoost2 (https://github.com/tmoerman/arboreto) was applied as
alternative in the SCENIC pipeline to infer gene regulatory networks from expression data. The same parameters in the pipeline
were used as for the DGRP-551 dataset except that we lowered the minimum number of required genes of a regulon.
NNLS regression
Cluster-to-bulk mapping was performed through a non-negative least-squares regression model (NNLS), as previously described by
(Stanescu et al., 2017). NNLS is a constrained version of least-squares regression where the coefficients are forced to be positive.
The regression model was fit using gene signatures derived from Seurat as features. Before fitting, all datasets were scaled to CPM
using the common genes, independent of previously applied normalization techniques. A higher weight in the model can be inter-
preted as a higher similarity between the cluster and the bulk RNA-seq. The calculations were performed using the SciPy (Jones
et al., 2001) package in Python.
Iterative Clustering for Identifying Markers
Iterative clustering for identifying markers (ICIM) was performed through the code available on Github (https://github.com/felixhorns/
FlyPN). The same genes found for the SMART-Seq2 data were used in the subclustering of the OPNs from cluster 27.
Age prediction using machine learning
Age prediction was performed using a random forest regression model (max_depth = 3, n_estimators = 8) with 5 fold cross validation
as implemented in scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Per gene decline with age was assessed by calculating the Pearson
correlation of gene expression with age.
Diffusion maps
Diffusion components were calculated on CPM normalized UMI matrices for each Seurat cluster using the Destiny package (R)
(Angerer et al., 2016). Next, the Pearson correlation with number of UMIs and age was calculated.
Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis enrichment
The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and glycolysis gene sets were extracted from (Jang et al., 2016) and from
(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) respectively. Cell enrichment for these gene sets were performed with AUCell (Aibar et al., 2017) using
default parameters.
Among the neurons, we defined 3 more groups along the x axis of the SCENIC t-SNE (Figure 4E) based on regulon AUC and gene
expression values. The cells that have a Dati regulon AUC value strictly above 0.3 are defined as ‘‘Central Brain A’’ (left group).
Second, ‘‘Central Brain B’’ is defined as the group of cells that have at least 2 UMIs in Imp expression and that are not part of ‘‘Central
Brain A’’ group of cells. Lastly, we classified cells as ‘‘Optic Lobe’’ if they have a Dati regulon AUC value strictly less than 0.15 and are
not part of ‘‘Central Brain B’’ group.
The assignment of each Seurat cluster to the three groups mentioned above was first done in an automated way i.e., the cluster
was assigned to the group which has the highest normalized number of cells in that group. The assignments were then manually
curated.
Next, the Seurat package was chosen to perform differential gene expression (bimod model) on one hand between Central Brain A
and Central Brain and on the other hand between Central Brain A and Optic Lobe. The two resulting gene sets were filtered by p value
(p value < 0.05) and log fold change (logFC > 0.2). Then, GO term enrichment was done on both sets using clusterProfiler (Yu et al.,
2012) with default parameters and the results were visualized with GOplot (Walter et al., 2015).
Mitochondrial reads cell proportion
The mitochondrial reads proportion across cells were calculated based on the mitochondrial genes. The UMI were summed over all
mitochondrial genes and then normalized using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) across Central Brain A/Central Brain B and Optic Lobe
groups.
Gene Ontology enrichment analysis
GO term enrichment was performed using GOrilla (Eden et al., 2009).
Exponential decline
The median value for the number of UMIs and the number of genes was calculated for each replicate and the following model was fit:
y = a$e�b$x + c, with x the age in days and y the number of UMIs/genes. The time constant was calculated as lnð2Þ
b
and is a measure
of the speed of the decline. The ratio was calculated by grouping young (< 6 days) and old (> 9 days) flies, taking the median per age,
followed by taking the mean over the different ages. Next, the old values were divided by the young values to calculate the
old/young ratio.

Figure S3. Bias Analysis of the Clusters and Kenyon Cell Subclusters, Related to Figure 2
(A) Bar plots showing UMI counts across the annotated and unannotated clusters at resolution 2.
(B–F) Stacked bar plots showing biases across the Seurat clusters at resolution 2 for (B) sex (C) age (D) genotype (E) DGRP-551 replicates (F) w1118 replicates.
(G and H) Groups are normalized for the number of cells (nCells) they contain. t-SNEs (left) and heatmaps (right) showing subclustering of the cells annotated as
KCs consisting of the main clusters 8 (g KC), 22 (a/b KC), and 28 (a’/b’ KC) (G) at resolution 0.2, which results in 4 clusters and (H) at resolution 2 which results in
16 clusters. Clusters were annotated by the expression of marker genes.
(I) Stacked bar plots showing biases across the subclusters at resolution 0.2 (left) and 2 (right) for sex, age, genotype, and replicates. The groups are normalized
for number of cells. Contribution of the cells from the main Seurat clusters 8, 22, and 28 is consistent with the cluster annotations. Resolution 0.2 doesn’t provide
more information about subtypes of KCs and higher resolutions result in biased clustering toward the parameters shown.

(A) Predicted network for Dati and Prospero target genes.
(B) Expression of predicted target genes positively and negatively correlated with Dati.
(C) Dati, Jim, Hb and Rn share the same binding motif and are positively correlated with each other, suggesting some form of redundancy in the network.
(D) Glycolysis activity for each Seurat cluster. Clusters are colored by main cell group.

 Figure S6. Comparison of OxPhos Levels and Main Cell Types between Fly and Human/Mouse, Related to Figures 4 and 7
(A) Oxidative phosphorylation gene set on human brain cells (Lake et al., 2018). The boxplot shows the AUC scores of the OxPhos gene set per cell type (same
approach as Figure 4J). The t-SNEs on the right show the pathway AUC, and regulons with enrichment of the pathway. For each regulon, the AUC (red) and TF
expression (orange) are shown.
(B) Comparison of human and fly cell types: The heatmap shows the percentage of human cells from each cell type in which the fly cluster signature (e.g., cluster
markers) are selected as ‘‘active’’ with AUCell.
(C) Expression of mouse glia/neuron markers on the fly cells.

Figure S7. Effects of Aging through Several Cell Types and Machine-Learning-Based Age Prediction, Related to Figures 5 and 6
(A) Scatterplot showing the ratio of the number of UMIs of old cells versus young cells against the time constant derived from the exponential decline model.
Colors are a measure for the goodness of fit (R2).
(legend continued on next page)
 (B) Decline in number of UMIs for the peptidergic neurons.
(C) Diffusion maps of the diffusion components mostly correlated with age for the mushroom body and dopaminergic neurons. Separation by age is mostly driven
by the number UMIs.
(D) Boxplots showing a decline in synthesis of mitochondrial proteins (new), with only a slight increase in old proteins (mature).
(E) Performance of the Random Forest Regressor age prediction for the different Seurat clusters and distinct major groups. Possible confounding variables are
shown. The diffusion component most correlated with age is shown; when no specification is made, DC1 is the major correlate.
