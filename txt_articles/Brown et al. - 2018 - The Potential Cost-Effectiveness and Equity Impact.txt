Abstract: Television (TV) advertising of food and beverages high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS)
influences food preferences and consumption. Children from lower socioeconomic position (SEP)
have higher exposure to TV advertising due to more time spent watching TV. This paper sought to
estimate the cost-effectiveness of legislation to restrict HFSS TV advertising until 9:30 pm, and to
examine how health benefits and healthcare cost-savings differ by SEP. Cost-effectiveness modelling
was undertaken (i) at the population level, and (ii) by area-level SEP. A multi-state multiple-cohort
lifetable model was used to estimate obesity-related health outcomes and healthcare cost-savings
over the lifetime of the 2010 Australian population. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were
reported, with assumptions tested through sensitivity analyses. An intervention restricting HFSS TV
advertising would cost AUD5.9M (95% UI AUD5.8M–AUD7M), resulting in modelled reductions in
energy intake (mean 115 kJ/day) and body mass index (BMI) (mean 0.352 kg/m2). The intervention
is likely to be cost-saving, with 1.4 times higher total cost-savings and 1.5 times higher health benefits
in the most disadvantaged socioeconomic group (17,512 HALYs saved (95% UI 10,372–25,155); total
cost-savings AUD126.3M (95% UI AUD58.7M–196.9M) over the lifetime) compared to the least
disadvantaged socioeconomic group (11,321 HALYs saved (95% UI 6812–15,679); total cost-savings
AUD90.9M (95% UI AUD44.3M–136.3M)). Legislation to restrict HFSS TV advertising is likely to be
cost-effective, with greater health benefits and healthcare cost-savings for children with low SEP.

1. Introduction
Childhood obesity is a significant public health issue worldwide [1]. Obesity in childhood is a risk
factor for overweight and obesity in adulthood [2], resulting in both short-term and long-term negative
health effects and highlighting the importance of obesity prevention for children and adolescents.
Childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity also have a socioeconomic gradient. Youth with a
low socioeconomic position (SEP) are at a greater risk of overweight and obesity compared to youth

with a higher SEP [3]. Population obesity prevention interventions that reduce these inequities are
increasingly being recognised as a critical component of successful obesity prevention efforts [4].
A diet high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) is a key modifiable risk factor for childhood obesity
and diet-related non-communicable diseases.
In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO)
concluded that television (TV) advertising influences children’s food preferences, purchase requests
and consumption patterns and published a set of recommendations on food marketing to children
(of which TV advertising is one component) [5].
Evidence also suggests there is a socioeconomic gradient in TV viewing patterns [6–8]. Australian
children with a lower SEP are more likely to watch TV and for longer periods of time compared to
those with a higher SEP [6,7]. This means that children with a lower SEP are likely to be exposed to
greater levels of HFSS TV advertising compared to children with a higher SEP. Restricting HFSS TV
advertising therefore has the potential to not only reduce obesity prevalence among youth, but also
reduce socioeconomic inequities in obesity prevalence.
Several countries have introduced regulatory schemes to reduce or restrict HFSS advertising.
Statutory regulations have resulted in bans on TV advertising to children in countries or jurisdictions
such as Quebec, Sweden and Norway [9]. Commercial broadcasters in Australia must meet legislated
broadcasting standards, and the Australian Communications and Media Authority’s (ACMA) Children
Television Standards (CTS) currently restrict the broadcasting of advertising during so-called ‘P’
(pre-school) programs [10]. The food industry introduced two self-regulatory, voluntary codes aimed
at reducing exposure of children to marketing, managed by the Australian Food and Grocery Council
(AFGC) [11].
The effectiveness of combinations of government and self-regulation in reducing the exposure of
children to HFSS TV advertising is however limited [12]. Critics of Australia’s self-regulated schemes
note the relatively weak commitments that form the initiatives, along with the lack of sanctions for
breaches of the codes [13]. Much of the TV content that Australian children aged 0–14 years watched in
2016 was not specifically categorised as children’s content, with 20% of the top 30 programs classified
as reality programs, 7% light entertainment and 20% movies [14]. A report by the Australian National
Preventive Health Agency (ANPHA) in 2012 [15] found that while advertising of non-core foods
during children’s classified (‘C’) programs is low, rates of HFSS advertising during children’s peak
free-to-air (FTA) viewing times is up to 6.5 advertisements per hour. Many Australian children are
therefore exposed to advertising of HFSS foods whilst watching shows not specifically classified
for children.
Despite the strong program logic that links exposure to HFSS TV advertising to increased HFSS
consumption and obesity, establishment of the effectiveness of its restriction is challenging [16]. Real
world evidence from jurisdictions that have implemented bans on HFSS advertising has shown
promising results on intermediate outcomes, including a reduction in expenditure on HFSS foods
following a ban on TV advertising in Quebec [17] and a reduction in HFSS drink expenditure following
a move to self-regulation and co-regulation in the UK [18]. Rigorous estimation of effectiveness
from an obesity prevention perspective is however complicated by the environmental-type nature
of the intervention, the potential role of confounding factors and the time lag between the change in
exposure and change in body mass index (BMI) being longer than many study timeframes. A relatively
small number of studies have quantified the obesity-related effects of reducing children’s exposure to
HFSS TV advertising using burden of disease or cost-effectiveness approaches and “best available”
evidence [19–23]. The key limitation of these modelling studies has been the reliance on individual
studies for the estimation of effect of TV advertising restrictions on BMI [24–27]. This has resulted
in the modelled effect size varying, from −0.03 kg/m2 [23] to −1 kg/m2 [19,20] (Supplementary
Information 1).
This paper aims to strengthen the evidence base on the potential cost-effectiveness of legislation
to restrict HFSS TV advertising from an obesity prevention perspective, by (i) undertaking analyses
using a synthesis of the evidence; (ii) accounting for differences in benefits and costs by SEP; and

(iii) exploring thresholds for minimum BMI effect required to achieve cost-effectiveness. This will
provide important information on the potential population level impact of the intervention, plus new
information on the intervention’s potential to reduce health inequities across socioeconomic groups.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Current Practice
Australian legislation currently prohibits TV advertising during ‘P’ classified programs [10].
TV networks must screen at least 260 h of Children’s (‘C’) programs per year in ‘C’ time bands
(7 am–8:30 am and 4 pm–8:30 pm weekdays, 7 am–8:30 pm weekends and school holidays). ‘C’
programs must not contain advertisements of more than 5 min in total per 30 min and content must
not mislead or deceive children, put undue pressure on purchases or contain promotions by popular
children’s characters immediately before, during or after a ‘C’ or ‘P’ period [10].
2.2. The Intervention
The proposed intervention was defined as legislation to implement time-based restrictions
of unhealthy food and beverage marketing to children under 16 years of age on FTA TV until
9:30 pm [28,29].
Peak TV viewing periods for Australian children are from 8 am–9 am and
7 pm–8 pm [30], and therefore legislation would reduce exposure to HFSS advertising. It should be
noted that older adolescents and adults may also benefit from reduced exposure to HFSS advertising,
however modelling has been undertaken in line with current policy recommendations (focusing on
benefits for children under 16 years) [26,27]. Whilst children aged under five years may also be exposed
to less HFSS TV advertising as a result of the intervention, this was considered less likely given their
relatively young age and higher likelihood of watching ‘P’ programs. The intervention effect estimation
was therefore limited to children aged between five and 15 years. We assumed that baseline viewing
in the intervention population occurs during the time period of the proposed intervention on FTA TV,
and tested assumptions around viewing patterns on FTA vs. non-FTA TV in sensitivity analyses.
2.3. Assessment of Benefit
A scoping review of the literature was conducted to inform the evidence of effect. Searches
were conducted by one author (VB), using the Scopus and EBSCOHost academic databases. “Gold
standard” evidence to inform modelling would consist of BMI effect estimates from reduced exposure
to HFSS TV advertising from high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in natural
settings [19,23]. A search was conducted for such evidence (Supplementary Information 2), with no
relevant studies identified in the literature.
Because of this absence of “gold standard” evidence, we defined the assessment of benefit of
the intervention using a method previously used [19], whereby the effect is estimated based on the
relationship between food promotion and consumption behaviours [16,31–33]. The logic pathway of
the intervention effect is given (Figure 1).
A scoping search was conducted for reviews and systematic reviews reporting the effects of TV
advertising on consumption in children and adolescents (Supplementary Information 2). Results of
keyword searches were reviewed, with the meta-analysis by Boyland et al. [33] identified due to its
immediate relevance and most recent publication date (2016). Boyland et al. [33] reviewed the evidence
for an association between exposure to HFSS food advertising and energy intake and reported mean
differences between exposure and control conditions. In order to model the effect of the intervention
to BMI, estimates of a change in kilocalorie (kcal) (energy intake) per minute exposed was required.
We conducted a meta-analysis of all studies in the review by Boyland et al. [33] that reported results
for children that could be converted to kcal effect per minute exposed to TV advertisements using
a random effects model. Heterogeneity was explored using Cochran’s Q and I2. Full meta-analysis
methods and the characteristics of included studies are reported in Supplementary Information 3.

Studies included in the meta‐analysis reported effects from acute exposure in controlled settings. 
Consumption under experimental conditions may not necessarily reflect consumption in natural 
settings, due to factors such as scrutiny, context and differences in time horizons and choice sets [34]. 
However, limited evidence on the external validity of such study findings exists. We therefore 
applied a crude adjustment factor for translation of experimental effects to the real‐world, assuming 
that 50% of the effect would be maintained under non‐experimental conditions (Table 1). 
Compensatory intake effect at mealtimes was also included, given evidence suggesting that children 
may compensate for snacks between meals by consuming less at mealtimes [35]. We therefore 
reduced the effect estimate, to conservatively estimate overall impact of exposure to HFSS TV 
advertisements on energy intake in children by assuming increased energy intake was a product of 
snacking between meals (Table 1). The derived estimate of effect was multiplied by estimates of time 
per day spent watching HFSS TV ads by age and SEP (Table 1, Supplementary information 4). The 
change in mean energy intake as a result of the intervention was then converted to change in mean 
BMI using the validated equations by Hall et al. [36], with assumptions tested in sensitivity analyses. 
2.4. Assessment of Costs 
Fixed costs were estimated as the cost of passing legislation [37] (Table 1). Ongoing costs 
comprised the salary costs of two administration and compliance officers [21], including salary on‐
costs [38–40]. Potential loss of revenue to TV networks resulting from reduced advertising was tested 
in sensitivity analysis. From a societal perspective, the base case assumed that potential loss of 
revenue for the food and advertising industries would be compensated by revenue for the 
advertisement of other products or consumer expenditure on other goods and services. Data on 
healthcare costs were obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) for 2001 
[41], and inflated to 2010 Australian dollar prices using the Health Price Index [42]. 
2.5. Cost‐Effectiveness Modelling 
Cost‐effectiveness modelling was undertaken from a limited societal perspective, with the time 
horizon for estimating costs, cost‐savings and health benefits being rest‐of‐life or 100 years for the 
2010 Australian population. Costs, cost‐savings and health benefits were discounted at 3% and were 
presented as 2010 values. 
Modelling was undertaken as (i) a whole population analysis, and (ii) an analysis by area‐level 
SEP, using the Socio‐Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) IRSD quintiles 1 (most disadvantaged) and 
5 (least disadvantaged) [43]. A proportional multi‐state, multiple cohort life table model was used to 
estimate obesity‐related health outcomes and healthcare cost‐savings. The model used data from the 
Australian Health Survey 2011–2012 [44] and disease epidemiology from the Global Burden of

snacks between meals by consuming less at mealtimes [35]. We therefore reduced the effect estimate,
to conservatively estimate overall impact of exposure to HFSS TV advertisements on energy intake
in children by assuming increased energy intake was a product of snacking between meals (Table 1).
The derived estimate of effect was multiplied by estimates of time per day spent watching HFSS TV
ads by age and SEP (Table 1, Supplementary Information 4). The change in mean energy intake as a
result of the intervention was then converted to change in mean BMI using the validated equations by
Hall et al. [36], with assumptions tested in sensitivity analyses.
2.4. Assessment of Costs
Fixed costs were estimated as the cost of passing legislation [37] (Table 1). Ongoing costs
comprised the salary costs of two administration and compliance officers [21], including salary
on-costs [38–40]. Potential loss of revenue to TV networks resulting from reduced advertising was
tested in sensitivity analysis. From a societal perspective, the base case assumed that potential
loss of revenue for the food and advertising industries would be compensated by revenue for the
advertisement of other products or consumer expenditure on other goods and services. Data on
healthcare costs were obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) for
2001 [41], and inflated to 2010 Australian dollar prices using the Health Price Index [42].
2.5. Cost-Effectiveness Modelling
Cost-effectiveness modelling was undertaken from a limited societal perspective, with the time
horizon for estimating costs, cost-savings and health benefits being rest-of-life or 100 years for the
2010 Australian population. Costs, cost-savings and health benefits were discounted at 3% and were
presented as 2010 values.
Modelling was undertaken as (i) a whole population analysis, and (ii) an analysis by area-level
SEP, using the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) IRSD quintiles 1 (most disadvantaged) and
5 (least disadvantaged) [43]. A proportional multi-state, multiple cohort life table model was used
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 622
5 of 14
to estimate obesity-related health outcomes and healthcare cost-savings. The model used data from
the Australian Health Survey 2011–2012 [44] and disease epidemiology from the Global Burden of
Disease study [45]. Modelling by SEP group incorporated SEIFA quintile specific data, including
disease incidence, mortality rate, BMI distribution and population number [37]. Potential impact
fractions estimated the proportional reduction in disease incidence that would occur through reduced
exposure to a risk factor as a result of an intervention. Disease-specific life tables estimated mortality
and morbidity for nine obesity-related diseases (ischaemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease,
ischemic stroke, diabetes, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer and
osteoarthritis). Interventions were compared against a “no intervention” comparator, where the
distribution of BMI in the 2010 reference year Australian population remained unchanged [46].
All modelling was undertaken in Microsoft Excel 2016. Uncertainty analysis around key input
parameters was estimated using Monte Carlo simulation (2000 iterations) using the Excel add-in
Ersatz (version 1.35) [47] to estimate 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UI). Quality of life in children was
incorporated using values from the literature [48]. Cohort-based modelling allowed disease-related
benefits which are not present in childhood to be estimated due to lingering BMI effects. It was
assumed that the BMI effect as a result of the intervention at age 15 years was maintained into
adulthood, allowing the estimation of health benefits and healthcare cost-savings over the lifetime.
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated by dividing the difference in the net
cost of the intervention by the difference in the net health benefit. ICER results were presented on a
cost-effectiveness plane. The AUD50,000 per health adjusted life year (HALY) threshold was used to
determine cost-effectiveness, as per Australian benchmarks [49].

2.6. Sensitivity Analyses
The base case assumes no loss of advertising revenue for broadcasters, given the likelihood of
new advertising contracts to fill existing advertising periods. The effect of this assumption was tested
in sensitivity analyses, assuming a short-term (one year) loss of revenue before networks recoup these
costs through new advertising contracts (Table 1) (Supplementary Information 5).
Multi-variate sensitivity analysis was undertaken by varying key input parameters in a
“worst-case” analysis (Table 1). Worst-case analysis incorporated network loss of revenue, a smaller
effect estimate derived from the meta-analysis (Supplementary Information 5) and greater adjustment
for translation of effect from experimental to real-world settings. Worst-case analysis also varied the
assumption that all TV viewing occurred on FTA TV. Pay TV and streamed services have gained
popularity amongst Australian TV viewing audiences, although limited data exists on the proportion
of children’s viewing time using these services. A recent report by Deloitte Australia [54] cited
that 22% of total viewing time is now via paid or streamed services, although this was based on a
non-representative survey of people aged over 14 years. In lieu of more rigorous data, the worst-case
analysis adjusted the mean minutes spent watching TV per day to assume that 22% of total viewing
time was on streamed services with no exposure to HFSS advertising (for example, services like Netflix).
2.7. Threshold Analysis
Given the relative uncertainty around the evidence of effect, a threshold analysis was undertaken
to determine the minimum effect size required to return a mean ICER less than the AUD50,000 per
HALY threshold [49]. Analysis was undertaken using base case intervention costs, and additionally
incorporating loss of short-term revenue to TV networks (Table 1).

2.8. Implementation Considerations
The broader impacts of an intervention that may not necessarily be captured within an economic
evaluation should also be considered in order to take into account the wide range of factors important
to decision-makers when setting priorities [55]. Cost-effectiveness results are discussed alongside
implementation considerations, which qualitatively assess the strength of evidence, feasibility,
acceptability and sustainability of the proposed intervention.
3. Results
Results suggest that an intervention restricting TV advertising of HFSS food and beverages to
children would cost AUD5.9M (95% UI AUD5.8M–AUD7M). The intervention would result in a
small mean decrease in energy intake (approximately 115 kJ/day) and a small mean BMI reduction
(0.352 kg/m2) at the population level (Table 2). The cost-effectiveness modelling showed that the
intervention would be dominant (i.e., cost-saving and health promoting), resulting in 88,396 HALYs
saved (95% UI 54,559–123,199) and total cost-savings of AUD777.9M (95% UI AUD369.8M–AUD1.2B)
at the population level over the lifetime (Table 2).

Importantly, the intervention may reduce health inequities, resulting in 1.5 times more HALYs 
and 1.4 times higher total cost‐savings in children living in the most disadvantaged areas (Q1) 
compared to the least disadvantaged areas (Q5) (Table 2). The cost‐effectiveness planes in Figure 2 
demonstrate the dominance of the intervention, at both the population level and for the most 
disadvantaged (Q1) and least disadvantaged (Q5) quintiles.

Worst-case sensitivity analysis results also suggested that the intervention would remain dominant

reduction 0.13 kg/m2, Supplementary Information 5), combined with a short-term loss of revenue to
TV networks (probability of: cost-effectiveness 99.5%, dominance 83.5%).
Threshold analysis demonstrated that the effect size (expressed as the relationship between
‘minutes of exposure to TV ads for HFSS food’ and ‘energy intake’) could be reduced by more than
two orders of magnitude (from a lower range estimate of 15.5 kcal per minute exposed, to <0.1 kcal
per minute exposed) for the intervention to remain cost-effective. In this scenario, assuming base case
intervention cost, a BMI reduction of 0.0004 kg/m2 would result in a mean ICER under the AUD50,000
cost-effectiveness threshold (mean ICER AUD44,688 per HALY saved (95% UI AUD28,815–79,516)).
Under the base case scenario for intervention benefits, short-term loss of revenue to TV networks
could be more than seven times higher (~$700 million), and the intervention would remain dominant
(mean ICER per HALY saved 95% UI dominant-AUD7215).
4. Discussion
An intervention restricting the exposure of Australian children to TV advertising of HFSS food
and beverages is likely to be cost-saving over the lifetime of the cohort under the base case and all
sensitivity analyses modelled, with greatest health benefits and cost-savings accrued by children living
in the most disadvantaged areas (Q1) compared to children living in the least disadvantaged areas (Q5).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an intervention restricting HFSS TV advertising
to children has been modelled taking into account differences in advertising exposure by SEP.
Results suggest the significant potential of legislation to restrict HFSS TV advertising to children in
addressing health inequities, in a cost-effective manner. Given that the differences in effect estimates by
SEP were determined by differences in TV viewing time within our analysis, the differences in health
benefits and total cost-savings by measure of area-level disadvantage may actually be under-estimates.
However, if the content of what children are watching on TV also differs by SEP (for instance, FTA
vs. paid/streamed services with varying levels of advertisement exposure), the differences in health
benefits and total cost-savings between children with low SEP and children with high SEP may vary in
other ways. More evidence quantifying the differential level and type of exposure of HFSS advertising
to children by SEP is required to better inform this analysis. Further, this study only examined
differences between SEP quintile one and five. Analysis across the entire socioeconomic spectrum
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 622

is required, in order to gain a complete understanding of the equity-related effects of legislation to
restrict HFSS TV advertising across all socioeconomic groups.
The most significant challenge to date remains the availability of rigorous evidence of effect of
the intervention to better inform analysis (Table 3). While this study is based on strong program
logic and the best available evidence of effect size, there is currently only limited evidence from
real-world implementations of advertising restrictions. As more jurisdictions implement advertising
restrictions (e.g., Chile, Canada), this will present increased opportunities to evaluate population-level
impacts. Results from our threshold analyses demonstrate the small effect size (compared to our
modelled effect estimates and meta-analyses based on previously published studies) required for the
intervention to be considered cost-effective, further supporting the logic for further intervention in this
area. Legislation restricting the exposure of children to TV advertising of HFSS foods and beverages is
being implemented internationally (Table 3). Ireland has recently announced a comprehensive ban
with a push for a 9 pm watershed on advertising of HFSS products on TV and radio, along with
regulation across other advertising mediums. Whilst the Code of Practice has not yet been released by
the Irish Department of Health, this demonstrates the feasibility of the intervention given the necessary
political will.

Implementation Consideration:
Adjustments/Considerations
Overall Rating
Strength of evidence
Direct evidence of BMI effect of TV advertising of food and
beverages HFSS from RCTs is currently not available. The
intervention is modelled using an effect estimate derived from
meta-analysis of non-naturalistic experimental evidence.
Low
Acceptability
Food, media industry acceptability
Likely to be low. Marketing and advertising drives sales.
Low
Political acceptability
To date, political motivation to enact legislation has been low but
may vary by political party and over time. International experience
in countries such as Ireland and the United Kingdom suggests the
potential for political acceptability.
Low
Consumer acceptability
Public support for government regulation of advertising of HFSS
food and beverages to children is high [56].
High
Feasibility
This legislative intervention is feasible to implement in the
Australian setting.
High
Sustainability
The intervention is sustainable once implemented. The ACMA
already has regulatory responsibilities and can oversee the
regulation of TV HFSS advertising.
The sustainability of potential BMI effect is unknown, and more
evidence is required on the effects of TV advertising of HFSS food
and beverages in adults.
High
Equity
Children with low SEP may have more exposure to HFSS TV
advertising than children with high SEP, due to differences in TV
viewing practices.
Positive
Side effects
Positive side effects
The intervention may have an impact on the food preferences and
consumption behaviours of older children and adults.
Positive
Negative side effects
The intervention may result in loss of revenue to TV networks
(likely to be short-term effect).
The intervention may result in loss of revenue to food companies
(although over the longer term it may be expected that companies
adapt to market conditions).
Policy conclusion: The intervention demonstrates significant potential for cost-effectiveness, positive equity effects and is
feasible, sustainable and acceptable to the Australian general public.

Our cost-effectiveness results are in keeping with previously published findings in Australia [21],
The United States [23] and internationally [22], that interventions to restrict TV advertising of HFSS
food and beverages are considered cost-effective (Supplementary Information 1). Whilst results are
not directly comparable due to methodological differences, there is now a growing body of evidence
that the societal benefits of an intervention restricting the exposure of children to HFSS TV advertising
outweigh the potential costs of legislation. In addition, our paper provides new evidence on the
potential for cost-effectiveness of the intervention when incorporating what we consider to be realistic
short-term loss of revenue to TV networks. In 2007, ACMA cited concerns regarding the impact of
restricting food and beverage advertising to children on the production of children’s TV programs
by networks [57]. The inclusion of network costs, whilst relatively uncertain given the commercial
sensitivity of trying to estimate loss of revenue for a hypothetical intervention, goes some way towards
addressing this issue. Our analyses including loss of advertising revenue to networks demonstrates
that the intervention remains cost-effective even when incorporating these costs (Supplementary
Information 5), suggesting the potential for cost-effective government reimbursement if required.
By limiting the intervention population to children aged five to 15 years, we may have
under-estimated the cost-effectiveness of the intervention at the population level. Studies have
suggested that HFSS TV advertising may also have an effect on food-related behaviours and attitudes
in older adolescents and adults, however at this time the evidence is inconclusive [33] and therefore we
have not included potential health benefits and cost-savings accruing to older adolescents and adults
as a result of the intervention into our analyses. Whilst this likely under-estimates cost-effectiveness,
more evidence is required in order to capture the full public health benefits of legislation to reduce
exposure to HFSS TV advertising across the entire child and adult population.
Limitations of our study include the assumption of maintenance of BMI effect into adulthood and
the modelled effect estimate used for base case and sensitivity analyses, taken from meta-analysis of a
small number of studies conducted in highly controlled experimental conditions. We have tried to
compensate for this suspected bias by adjusting the effect estimate for a more plausible translation to a
real-world setting, and for compensatory meal behaviours of children who snack. Adjustments were
made using best-available evidence and logic pathways, however a more rigorous understanding of
the effects of TV advertising on the consumption of HFSS food and beverages in children is clearly an
area for significant future research.
It is likely that the food industry would oppose the introduction of more stringent TV advertising
legislation, and this is recognised as a potential barrier to the implementation of this public health
policy [58]. Whilst our analysis took a limited societal perspective, we have not included loss of revenue
to the food industry as a result of the intervention. We have instead assumed that any loss of food
industry revenue from a reduction in demand for HFSS food and beverages would be compensated in
increased demand for non-discretionary foods or other items, and therefore doesn’t result in a loss
to society. However, this is yet to be rigorously and definitively tested. In addition to its effect on
consumption, advertising is also designed to influence market share within a category, and the impact
of advertising restrictions on individual companies is not analysed in this paper.
Finally, television advertising is only one medium used for marketing of HFSS food and
beverages, and although traditional TV viewing is still the most dominant promotional channel,
it may be waning [16]. Changes to technology have led to the development and implementation
of comprehensive approaches to marketing focused on brand and relationship development,
including advertising across mediums, sponsorship, product placement, brand mascots and celebrity
endorsement, sales promotion, labelling and point-of-purchase displays [5]. This analysis did not take
into account potential shifts in advertising from TV to other media in response to the intervention.
Ideally this intervention would be combined with more comprehensive marketing restrictions across
multiple forms of media, as well as form part of a broader obesity prevention strategy across health
and non-health sectors (for example, fiscal, built environment, education interventions) [28,29]. Results
from this study form part of a broader body of work into obesity prevention priority-setting in
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 622

Australia, using standardised methods [37,46,59] and designed to better inform obesity prevention
policy. Other interventions found to be cost-saving to date include sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB)
taxation [37] and reformulation or package size caps of SSBs [46].
5. Conclusions
This study indicates the significant potential of legislation restricting TV advertising of HFSS food
and beverages to Australian children as a cost-effective intervention, with greatest benefits for the
most socioeconomically disadvantaged. All modelled scenarios and sensitivity analyses resulted in
dominance (i.e., an intervention that is both cost-saving and improves long term health outcomes). Our
analysis by measure of area-level socioeconomic disadvantage demonstrates greater health benefits
and total cost-savings in those living in the most disadvantaged socioeconomic areas compared to those
living in the least disadvantaged areas. Furthermore, results from our threshold analysis demonstrate
the very small population level effect size required for the intervention to be considered cost-effective.
