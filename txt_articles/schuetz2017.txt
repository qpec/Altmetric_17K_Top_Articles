Background
Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise of a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral, and other
aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin (PCT), a blood marker for bacterial infections, has emerged as a promising tool to improve
decisions about antibiotic therapy (PCT-guided antibiotic therapy). Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the
feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with ARIs and different settings
ranging from primary care settings to emergency departments, hospital wards, and intensive care units. However, the effect of using
procalcitonin on clinical outcomes is unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review and individual participant data meta-analysis first
published in 2012 designed to look at the safety of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship.
Objectives
The aim of this systematic review based on individual participant data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for
starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings.
Search methods
We searchedthe Cochrane Central Registerof ControlledTrials(CENTRAL), which containsthe Cochrane Acute RespiratoryInfections
Group’s Specialised Register, MEDLINE, and Embase, in February 2017, to identify suitable trials. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov
to identify ongoing trials in April 2017.
Selection criteria
We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received an antibiotic treatment either based on a procalcitonin algorithm (PCT-
guided antibiotic stewardship algorithm) or usual care. We excluded trials if they focused exclusively on children or used procalcitonin
for a purpose other than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment.
Data collection and analysis
Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. The primary endpoints
were all-cause mortality and treatment failure at 30 days, for which definitions were harmonised among trials. Secondary endpoints
were antibiotic use, antibiotic-related side effects, and length of hospital stay. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and clinical diagnosis using a fixed-effect
model. The different trials were added as random-effects into the model. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by clinical setting
and type of ARI. We also performed an aggregate data meta-analysis.
Main results
From 32 eligible RCTs including 18 new trials for this 2017 update, we obtained individual participant data from 26 trials including
6708 participants, which we included in the main individual participant data meta-analysis. We did not obtain individual participant
data for four trials, and two trials did not include people with confirmed ARIs. According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence was
high for the outcomes mortality and antibiotic exposure, and quality was moderate for the outcomes treatment failure and antibiotic-
related side effects.
Primary endpoints: there were 286 deaths in 3336 procalcitonin-guided participants (8.6%) compared to 336 in 3372 controls (10.0%),
resulting in a significantly lower mortality associated with procalcitonin-guided therapy (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99, P
= 0.037). We could not estimate mortality in primary care trials because only one death was reported in a control group participant.

Procalcitonin to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Treatment failure was not significantly lower in procalcitonin-guided participants (23.0% versus 24.9% in the control group, adjusted
OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01, P = 0.068). Results were similar among subgroups by clinical setting and type of respiratory infection,
with no evidence for effect modification (P for interaction > 0.05). Secondary endpoints: procalcitonin guidance was associated with a
2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure (5.7 versus 8.1 days, 95% CI -2.71 to -2.15, P < 0.001) and lower risk of antibiotic-related
side effects (16.3% versus 22.1%, adjusted OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Length of hospital stay and intensive care unit
stay were similar in both groups. A sensitivity aggregate-data analysis based on all 32 eligible trials showed similar results.
Authors’ conclusions
This updated meta-analysis of individual participant data from 12 countries shows that the use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and
duration of antibiotic treatment results in lower risks of mortality, lower antibiotic consumption, and lower risk for antibiotic-related
side effects. Results were similar for different clinical settings and types of ARIs, thus supporting the use of procalcitonin in the context
of antibiotic stewardship in people with ARIs. Future high-quality research is needed to confirm the results in immunosuppressed
patients and patients with non-respiratory infections.

Testing blood procalcitonin levels to decide when to start and stop antibiotics in adults with acute respiratory tract infections
Review question
What are the effects of using procalcitonin to start or discontinue antibiotics in people with acute respiratory infections compared to
routine care on mortality and treatment failure?
Background
In people with acute respiratory infections, unnecessary antibiotic use significantly contributes to increasing bacterial resistance, medical
costs, and the risk of drug-related adverse events. The blood marker procalcitonin increases in bacterial infections and decreases when
patients recover from the infection. Procalcitonin can be measured in the blood of patients by different commercially available assays
with a turnaround time of around one to two hours and support clinical decision making about initiation and discontinuation of
antibiotic therapy.
Search date
We conducted electronic searches on 10 February 2017. We conducted searches for ongoing trials on 12 April 2017.

All included trials randomised participants with acute respiratory infections to receive antibiotics based on procalcitonin levels (’procal-
citonin-guided’ group) or a control group. The trials were performed in primary care, the emergency department and medical wards,
and the intensive care unit. Included participants had acute upper or lower respiratory infections, including pneumonia, bronchitis,
exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and others.
Study funding sources
All studies were investigator-initiated trials. Half of the trials were funded by national agencies or did not report funding, and half of
the trials received funding from the biomarker industry (e.g. Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Key results
We studied 6708 participants from 26 trials in 12 countries. Mortality at 30 days was significantly lower in procalcitonin-guided
participants compared to control participants (286 deaths in 3336 procalcitonin-guided participants (8.6%) versus 336 deaths in 3372
controls (10.0%)). There was no significant difference with regard to treatment failures. Results were similar for different clinical
settings (primary care, emergency department, intensive care unit) and types of respiratory infection. Regarding antibiotic exposure,
participants in the procalcitonin-guided group had a 2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure and a reduction in antibiotic-related side
effects (16.3% versus 22.1%).

 The quality of the evidence was high for mortality and antibiotic exposure. Most of the trials did not use blinding, however we did not
expect that mortality would be biased by this limitation. The quality of the evidence was moderate for treatment failure and antibiotic-
related side effects because the definitions for these endpoints among trials were not identical.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1No downgrading for serious concerns. Still, there is some concern about unconcealed allocation in several trials in the
emergency department and intensive care settings. There is also some concern about low adherence with the PCT algorithm
in the intervention group. We consider unblinded outcome assessment as not relevant for the outcome of death.
2Downgraded one level for serious inconsistency: trials used differing definition of treatment failure and some rare events
were not systematically assessed among trials.
3For the primary care setting, treatment failure was defined as death, hospitalisation, acute respiratory infection (ARI)-specific
complications (e.g. empyema for lower ARI, meningitis for upper ARI), recurrent or worsening infection, and participants
reporting any symptoms of an ongoing respiratory infection (e.g. fever, cough, dyspnoea) at follow-up. For the emergency
department setting, treatment failure was defined as death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, rehospitalisation after index
hospital discharge, ARI-associated complications (e.g. empyema or acute respiratory distress syndrome for lower ARI), and
recurrent or worsening infection within 30 days of follow-up. For the ICU setting, treatment failure was defined as death within
30 days of follow-up.
4Downgraded one level for incomplete reporting: only 6 trials reported side effects from antibiotics, and none of these trials
were conducted in the ICU setting.

 B A C K G R O U N D
Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) account for over 10% of global
disease burden and are the most common reason for antibi-
otic therapy in primary care and hospital settings (Evans 2002;
Gonzales 1997; Zaas 2014).
Description of the condition
Acute respiratory infections comprise a heterogeneous group of
infections including bacterial, viral, and other aetiologies. As many
as 75% of all antibiotic doses are prescribed for ARIs, despite their
mainly viral cause (Doan 2014; Evans 2002). Early initiation of
adequate antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone in the treatment
of bacterial ARIs and is associated with improved clinical out-
comes (Hoare 2006; Kumar 2006; Kumar 2009; Liberati 2009b;
Spurling 2010). However, overuse of antibiotics by overprescrip-
tion in outpatients with bronchitis (Arnold 2005), for instance,
and prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy in people with bac-
terial ARIs in the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) settings
is associated with increased resistance to common bacteria, high
costs, and adverse drug reactions (Gonzales 1997; Goossens 2005;
Lawrence 2009; Zaas 2014).
Description of the intervention
The presence of a diagnostic ’gold standard’ or reference standard
represents the best available method for establishing the presence
or absence of a disease. Optimally, a morphological verification
such as histopathology or, in the case of ARIs, growth of typical
pathogens in blood cultures or sputum cultures can be obtained to
establish the ’correct’ diagnosis. Regrettably, the use of blood cul-
tures as the assumed gold standard in ARIs lacks sensitivity, speci-
ficity, or both, with only around 10% of people with pneumonia
having positive cultures and some of them being false positives
(Muller 2010). In this diagnostic uncertainty, surrogate biomarker
to estimate the likelihood for the presence of a bacterial infection
and to grade disease severity are of great interest (Schuetz 2015).
In such a circumstance, two fundamentally different concepts are
employed. One concept tends to ignore potential dilemmas in the
accuracy of the alleged gold standard but assumes a well-defined
illness, which is represented by the assumption drawn following a
diagnostic test or a clinical diagnosis. The second concept discards
alleged gold standards and focuses on patient outcomes. In the
case of ARIs, the clinical benefit of a diagnostic biomarker, such
as procalcitonin (PCT), can be measured by clinical outcomes of
randomised intervention studies, assuming that if the person re-
covered without antibiotics then there was no relevant bacterial
illness.
In recent years, PCT has emerged as a promising marker for the di-
agnosis of bacterial infections because higher levels are found in se-
vere bacterial infectionsbutremainfairlylowinviral infectionsand
non-specific inflammatory diseases (Muller 2000; Muller 2001;
Muller 2010). Procalcitonin is released in multiple tissues in re-
sponse to bacterial infections via a direct stimulation of cytokines,
such as interleukin (IL)-1β, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-
,
and IL-6. Conversely, PCT production is blocked by interferon
gamma, a cytokine released in response to viral infections (Muller
2000). Hence, PCT may be used to support clinical decision mak-
ing for the initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in
different types of infections and indications (Sager 2017; Schuetz
2016). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated
the feasibility of such a strategy in different ARI patient popula-
tions and different settings ranging from primary care to emer-
gency departments and hospital wards to medical and surgical
ICUs (Bloos 2016; Branche 2015; Corti 2016; De Jong 2016;
Deliberato 2013; Layios 2012; Long 2014; Maravi -Stojkovi
2011; Oliveira 2013; Shehabi 2014; Verduri 2015; Wang 2016).
How the intervention might work
Procalcitonin levels correlate with the risk of relevant bacterial
infections and decrease upon recovery. Procalcitonin testing may
therefore help physicians decide in which patients antibiotics are
needed and when it is safe to stop treatment (Kutz 2015). The
use of PCT in clinical protocols may thus decrease antibiotic con-
sumption in two ways: by preventing unnecessary antibiotic pre-
scriptions and by limiting durations of antibiotic treatment (Sager
2017; Schuetz 2011a).
Why it is important to do this review
While several RCTs have evaluated PCT-guided antibiotic treat-
ment, most individual trials included participants with different
types of respiratory and non-respiratory infections and lacked the
statistical power to assess the risk for mortality and severe infec-
tious disease complications associated with PCT-guided decision
making. Previous meta-analyses of RCTs investigating the effect
of PCT algorithms on antibiotic use focused on the critical care
setting, people with suspicion of bacterial infections, and people
with sepsis and respiratory infections (Heyland 2011; Hoeboer
2015; Tang 2009; Wacker 2013). However, these meta-analyses
used aggregated data and were not able to investigate the effects
of PCT on different ARI diagnoses and on outcomes other than
mortality. A previous meta-analysis based on individual partici-
pant data published in the Cochrane Library did not find a sig-
nificant difference in clinical outcomes, but confidence intervals
remained relatively wide (Schuetz 2012). Safety of using PCT for
antibiotic decision making remained thus unproven.

 The aim of this systematic review based on individual participant
data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for
starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with
varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Prospective RCTs comparing a strategy to initiate or discontinue
antibiotic therapy based on PCT levels with a control arm with-
out PCT measurements were eligible for inclusion. Participants
were randomised to receive antibiotics either based on PCT levels
(’PCT-guided’ group) or a control group without knowledge of
PCT levels, including antibiotic management based on usual care
or guidelines. We did not include non-randomised studies.
Types of participants
We included adult participants with clinical diagnoses of ARIs:
either a lower ARI including community-acquired pneumo-
nia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-as-
sociated pneumonia (VAP), acute bronchitis, exacerbation of
asthma, or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD); or an upper ARI including common cold, rhino-sinusi-
tis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or otitis media. We also included people
with sepsis and suspected ARIs in the analyses. We excluded trials
if they focused exclusively on children or used PCT to escalate
antibiotic therapy. We made no exclusions based on language of
reports or clinical setting. We included trials from primary care,
emergency departments, and medical and surgical ICUs.
Types of interventions
Strategies to initiate or discontinue antibiotic therapy based on
PCT levels compared with usual care were eligible.
Types of outcome measures
We defined primary and secondary outcomes to a follow-up time
of 30 days. For trials with shorter follow-up periods, we used the
available information (i.e. until hospital discharge). We excluded
all trials with different follow-up times for mortality in a sensitivity
analysis.
Primary outcomes
1. All-cause mortality following randomisation up to a follow-
up time of 30 days.
2. Setting-specific treatment failure within 30 days of
inclusion.
For the primary care setting, we defined treatment failure as
death, hospitalisation, ARI-specific complications (e.g. empyema
for lower ARIs, meningitis for upper ARIs), recurrent or worsening
infection, and still having ARI-associated discomfort at 30 days.
For the emergency department setting, we defined treatment fail-
ure as death, ICU admission, rehospitalisation after index hospital
discharge, ARI-associated complications (e.g. empyema or acute
respiratory distress syndrome for lower ARIs), and recurrent or
worsening infection within 30 days of follow-up. For the medical
and surgical ICU setting, we defined treatment failure as death
within 30 days of follow-up and recurrent or worsening infection.
Secondary outcomes
1. Antibiotic use (initiation of antibiotics, duration of
antibiotics, and total exposure to antibiotics (total amount of
antibiotic days divided by total number of participants)).
2. Length of hospital stay for hospitalised participants.
3. Length of ICU stay for critically ill participants.
4. Number of days with restricted activities within 14 days
after randomisation for primary care participants.
5. Antibiotic-related side effects.
Search methods for identification of studies
We updated the search strategy for this review in February 2017
in collaboration with the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections
Group’s Information Specialist. We performed data collection
based on the protocol of a previous meta-analysis of individual par-
ticipant data published in the Cochrane Library (Schuetz 2008).
Electronic searches
We updated the searches for this review in February 2017, running
the search across all databases from the date of inception to 10
February 2017. We screened all new references identified by the
search. We searched the following databases for published studies:
• The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 1), part of the Cochrane Library,
which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections
Group’s Specialised Register, www.cochranelibrary.com/
(accessed 10 February 2017) (Appendix 1);
• MEDLINE Ovid (1966 to 10 February 2017) (Appendix
2);
• Embase.com (1980 to 10 February 2017) (Appendix 3).
We used the search strategy in Appendix 4 to conduct searches for
the 2012 version of this review (Schuetz 2012).

 We also searched for ongoing and completed trials in the following
trial register:
• US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register
ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov/; searched 12 April
2017).
We did not apply any language or publication restrictions.
Searching other resources
We contacted experts for further eligible trials.
Data collection and analysis
We requested individual participant data from the investigators of
all included trials. We checked all provided data against published
reports, and if needed, corrected any discrepancies.
We prepared this review update according to PRISMA guidelines
and the PRISMA-IPD guideline (Liberati 2009a; Stewart 2015).
Selection of studies
At least two review authors (RS, YW, PS) independently assessed
trial eligibility based on titles, abstracts, full-text reports, and fur-
ther information from investigators as needed.
Data extraction and management
We checked data from each trial against reported results and re-
solved any queries with the principal investigator, trial data man-
ager, or statistician. The mortality and adverse outcome rates from
trials included in this review may differ slightly from previous re-
ports because we treated data in a consistent manner across all
trials.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (RS, YW) assessed the methodological qual-
ity of each included study using the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool
and resolved any disagreements by discussion (Higgins 2011).
Methodological criteria included: adequate sequence generation
and concealment of treatment allocation; blinding of participants,
physicians and clinical outcome assessment; whether the study was
free of selective reporting; and the proportion of participants lost
to follow-up. We documented the proportion of participants in
the PCT group that adhered to the PCT algorithm used in each
study, defining adherence to the PCT algorithm of lower than
70% as high risk of bias, and, if not reported, as unclear risk.
Due to the study design of the included studies, physicians were
aware of the participants’ study group because in the intervention
group physicians used the PCT result for decision making about
antibiotic treatment, while in the control group no PCT result
was communicated to the physicians. Blinding of physicians was
therefore not feasible, resulting in an unclear risk for performance
bias in all studies.
We assessed the quality of evidence at the outcome level using the
GRADE approach (GRADEpro GDT 2014).
Measures of treatment effect
We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression for the
co-primary endpoints of mortality from any cause and treatment
failure (Thompson 2001; Turner 2000). We fitted corresponding
linear and logistic regression models for continuous and binary
secondary endpoints, respectively. We calculated Kaplan-Meier
curves for time to death for graphical display.
We used Stata version 12.1 (College Station, TX) for statistical
analyses (Stata 12.1).
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of our primary analysis was the individual study partic-
ipant. We analysed all participants in the study group to which
they were randomised. We calculated summary estimates using
aggregated data from individual trials as a sensitivity analysis.
Dealing with missing data
We received the full data sets from all trials included in the indi-
vidual participant data analysis (n = 26) with all available follow-
up information (if recorded in the trials).
We assumed in our main analysis that participants lost to follow-
up did not experience an event. We explored if a complete-case
analysis (excluding participants lost to follow-up) or an analysis
assuming that participants lost to follow-up experienced an event
would change the results for the primary outcomes of mortality
and treatment failure in sensitivity analyses. We checked all indi-
vidual participant data against the published results but did not
find significant differences that warranted further exploration.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We performed prespecified analyses stratified by clinical setting
(i.e. primary care, emergency department, ICU) and ARI diagno-
sis (CAP
, COPD, bronchitis, VAP) to investigate the consistency
of results across our heterogeneous patient populations in terms
of disease severity. We formally tested for potential subgroup ef-
fects by adding the clinical setting and ARI diagnosis in turn to
the regression model together with the corresponding interaction
term with the PCT group as a fixed-effect model. We assessed
heterogeneity by estimating the I2 statistic (the percentage of to-
tal variance across trials that is due to heterogeneity rather than
chance) in meta-analyses using aggregated data and by testing for
heterogeneity using the Cochran Q test (Higgins 2003).

 Assessment of reporting biases
We assessed reporting bias by attempting to identify if the study
was included in a trial registry, a protocol was available, and if
the methods section provided a list of outcomes. We compared
listed outcomes from those sources to outcomes reported in the
published papers.
Data synthesis
We used multivariable hierarchical logistic regression to combine
participant data from the trials (Thompson 2001; Turner 2000).
Apart from the group variable indicating the use of a PCT algo-
rithm, we included important prognostic factors such as partici-
pant age and ARI diagnosis as an additional fixed effect;to account
for within- and between-trial variability, we added a categorical
trial variable to the model as a random effect. In meta-analyses
with aggregated trial data we calculated summary ORs using a
random-effects model and the Mantel-Haenszel facility of Review
Manager 5 (RevMan 2014).
GRADE and ’Summary of findings’ table
We created a ’Summary of findings’ table using the following out-
comes: all-cause mortality at 30 days, setting-specific treatment
failure at 30 days, total exposure to antibiotics, and antibiotic-re-
lated side effects (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
The results reported in this table correspond to the main IPD
analysis and are slightly different from the aggregate data analysis.
We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, con-
sistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias)
to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the stud-
ies that contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified
outcomes (Atkins 2004). We used the methods and recommen-
dations in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), employing
GRADEpro GDT software (GRADEpro GDT 2014). We justi-
fied all decisions to down- or upgrade the quality of studies using
footnotes, and we made comments to aid the reader’s understand-
ing of the review where necessary.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We performed prespecified analyses stratified by clinical setting
and ARI diagnosis and formally tested for potential subgroup ef-
fects by adding an interaction term into the statistical model.
Sensitivity analysis
We performed prespecified sensitivity analyses based on the main
quality indicators: allocation concealment, blinded outcome as-
sessment, adherence to the PCT algorithm (we defined low adher-
ence to PCT algorithms as < 70%), and follow-up time for mor-
tality other than one month. We also performed an aggregate data
meta-analysis using all trials with potentially eligible participants.

Results of the search
After removal of duplicates, we identified 998 records that we fur-
ther assessed based on title and abstracts, excluding 919 records.
We obtained 79 full-text study reports, and following assessment
excluded 39 that did not meet our inclusion criteria. Eight studies
were ongoing trials. From 32 eligible RCTs (9909 participants)
including 18 new trials for this 2017 update, we obtained indi-
vidual participant data from 26 trials including 6708 participants,
which were included in the main individual participant data meta-
analysis (see Figure 1). We did not obtain individual participant
data for four trials, and two trials did not include participants with
confirmed ARIs. The sensitivity aggregate analysis includes all 32
trials.

 Included studies
We included a total of 26 studies involving 6708 participants in
the main individual participant data meta-analysis. Study charac-
teristics are presented in Table 1.
Participants
Baseline characteristics of included participants were similar in
the PCT and control groups with respect to important prognostic
features (Table 2). Most participants were recruited either in the
emergency department or ICU setting, and CAP was the most fre-
quent ARI diagnosis, reported in more than 40% of participants.
Settings
Trials were conducted in 12 countries: Switzerland, Germany,
France, Italy, USA, China, Denmark, Netherlands, Brazil, Bel-
gium, Australia, and Serbia. Trials were conducted in different
clinical settings including primary care, emergency departments
and medical wards, and ICU. There were two primary care trials
with upper and lower respiratory infection patients; 11 emergency
department and medical ward trials with lower ARI patients; and
13 ICU trials with mostly septic patients due to infections of the
lower respiratory tract.
Interventions
Procalcitonin algorithms used in the different trials were similar
in concept and recommended initiation and/or continuation of
antibiotic therapy based on similar PCT cut-off levels (reviewed
in Schuetz 2011a). However, there were differences: some trials
in primary care and the emergency department used only a sin-
gle PCT measurement on admission to guide initiation of antibi-
otics, while the other trials (predominantly in hospitalised patients
with severe infections) used repeated measurements for guiding
the duration of treatment. One trial used a point-of-care device
(Corti 2016). Adherence to algorithms varied, ranging from 44%
to 100% (Table 3).
Comparators
In control group participants, PCT was not used to guide treat-
ment decisions, but this decision was up to the treating physi-
cian team. In some trials, physicians were asked to follow antibi-
otic guidelines for control group participants (Briel 2008; Schuetz
2009). In one trial, the control group was guided with C-reactive
protein levels (Oliveira 2013).
Funding sources
All studies were investigator-initiated trials. Half of the trials were
funded by national agencies or did not report funding; the other
half of the trials received funding from the biomarker industry
(e.g. Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Excluded studies
We excluded a total of 39 studies due to wrong intervention (n
= 1), wrong population (n = 2), and wrong design (not RCT) (n
= 36). A total of nine studies reported as ongoing in the 2012
review were now available for assessment; we included four of these
studies in this current update (Annane 2013; Bloos 2016; De Jong
2016; Lima 2016), and did not include five studies due to wrong
population (paediatrics).
Ongoing studies
Our searches of the trial register identified seven ongoing stud-
ies that we will assess for inclusion for the next review update
(Ongoing studies). These studies focus on the utility of PCT in
people with pneumonitis (NCT02862314), pulmonary embolism
(NCT02261610), lower respiratory infection (NCT02130986),
heart failure (NCT02787603), and intraoperative positive-end ex-
piratory pressure optimisation (NCT02931409). Two trials are
antibiotic efficacy trials (NCT02332577; NCT02440828).
Risk of bias in included studies
The overall risk of bias is presented graphically in Figure 2 and
Figure 3. The risk of bias was mostly low for random sequence gen-
eration, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and
selective reporting; unclear for blinding of personnel in all studies;
and mostly high for blinding of outcome assessment.

 Allocation
All studies randomised participants to intervention (PCT testing)
or control groups. A total of 25 trials with mainly computer-gen-
erated lists and centralised randomisation were at low risk of selec-
tion bias. Seven trials were at high or unclear risk of selection bias.
Risk for selection bias with regard to random sequence generation
was due to weekly allocation (Christ-Crain 2004), unnumbered
envelopes (Christ-Crain 2006; Stolz 2007), use of odd and even
patient identification numbers (Long 2009; Long 2011), and un-
concealed drawing of lots (Hochreiter 2009; Schroeder 2009).
Blinding
None of the included trials blinded physicians to group allocation
because PCT was used for decision making in the intervention
group, thus all trials had unclear risk for blinding of participants
and personnel.
All trials used blinded outcome assessment (Briel 2008; Bouadma
2010; Branche 2015; Layios 2012; Schuetz 2009; Shehabi 2014;
Stolz 2007; Tang 2013), employing blinded telephone interviews
to assess vital status and other outcomes.
Incomplete outcome data
The included trials had a high follow-up for mortality with few
participants lost to follow-up (Table 3). In seven trials, outcome
assessment was done after hospital or ICU discharge (Deliberato
2013; Hochreiter 2009; Kristoffersen 2009; Layios 2012; Long
2009; Schroeder 2009; Shehabi 2014). One trial had a high num-
ber of post randomisation exclusions (six in the intervention arm
versus four in the control group) and thus had an unclear risk of
bias (Ding 2013).
Selective reporting
No reporting bias was found when study protocols and final results
were compared. However, we did not find registration numbers
for four trials (Ding 2013; Layios 2012; Maravi -Stojkovi 2011;
Najafi 2015), which we considered to be at unclear risk of bias.
We found no evidence of reporting bias by visual inspection of
funnel plots (Figure 4).

Other potential sources of bias
Another potential source of bias relates to low adherence to the
PCT algorithms, particularly for safety endpoints. Overall, adher-
ence varied, ranging from 44% to 100% (Table 3).
With regard to funding, 16 trials reported no industry funding
(six did not report any funding, 10 reported public funding), and
in 16 trials Thermo Fisher, the producer of the PCT assay, funded
or co funded the studies by providing free-of-charge PCT kits or
additional research funds, or both.

Procalcitonin algorithm compared to standard care for guiding
antibiotic therapy in acute respiratory tract infections
Primary outcomes
1. All-cause mortality following randomisation up to a
follow-up time of 30 days
There were 286 deaths in 3336 PCT-guided participants (8.6%)
compared to 336 in 3372 controls (10.0%) resulting in a signif-
icantly lower mortality associated with PCT-guided therapy (ad-
justed odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to
0.99, P = 0.037) (Table 4). This effect was consistent across clin-
ical settings (P for interaction > 0.05), although mortality could
not be estimated in primary care trials because only one death was
reported in a control group participant. The effect on mortality
was also consistent among different ARI diagnoses (CAP
, COPD,
bronchitis, VAP) (P for interaction > 0.05). As a further sensitiv-
ity analysis and to investigate heterogeneity among trials, we also
calculated an aggregate data meta-analysis based on the aggregate
results of all 32 potentially eligible trials (thus not limited to ARI
participants only). In this analysis, the results proved robust, al-
though the mortality estimate did not reach statistical significance
(OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; Analysis 1.1; Figure 5). There
was no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 0%).

 2. Setting-specific treatment failure within 30 days of
inclusion
Treatment failure was not significantly lower in PCT-guided par-
ticipants (23.0% versus 24.9%, adjusted OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80
to 1.01, P = 0.068). These results were similar among subgroups
by clinical setting and type of respiratory infection (P for interac-
tion > 0.05). With an OR of 0.90 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.99), treat-
ment failure was significantly lower in PCT group participants in
an aggregate data meta-analysis based on all 32 potentially eligible
trials (thus relying on the original definition of treatment failure
as used in the trials). There was no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 =
0%) (Figure 6). We also performed several predefined sensitivity
analyses, which showed no evidence for interactions (see summary
in Table 5).

 Secondary outcomes
1. Antibiotic use (initiation of antibiotics, duration of
antibiotics, and total exposure to antibiotics (total amount
of antibiotic days divided by total number of participants))
Procalcitonin guidance was associated with a reduction in total
antibiotic exposure (mean 8.1 days compared to 5.7 days, regres-
sion coefficient -2.43 days (95% CI -2.71 to -2.15), P < 0.001).
Also, duration of antibiotic treatment in treated participants was
shorter (mean 9.4 days compared to 8.0 days, adjusted coefficient
-1.83 days (95% CI -2.15 to -1.5), P < 0.001) (Table 6).
2. Length of hospital stay for hospitalised participants
However, the effect on antibiotic consumption differed according
to clinical setting. In the primary care setting, lower antibiotic ex-
posure was mainly due to lower initial prescription rates (P < 0.001
for interaction between primary care setting and PCT group on
antibiotic prescriptions). Similarly, lower antibiotic exposure due
to lower prescription rates was found in selected infections such as
acute bronchitis (adjusted OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.26; P for
interaction < 0.001). Lower antibiotic prescription rates (adjusted
OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58) and shorter duration of antibi-
otic therapy in participants with initiation of antibiotic (adjusted
coefficient -2.45 days, 95% CI -2.86 to -2.05) contributed to the
lower overall exposure in the emergency department setting.
Length of hospital stay and ICU stay were similar in both groups
with no evidence for different effects in subgroups (P for interac-
tion > 0.05).
3. Length of ICU stay for critically ill participants
For the ICU setting, the lower exposure was mainly explained
by shorter treatment durations (adjusted difference in days -1.23,
95% CI -1.82 to -0.65). Similarly, for CAP
, the lower exposure
was mainly explained by shorter durations (adjusted difference in
days -2.45, 95% CI -2.87 to -2.02).
4. Number of days with restricted activities within 14 days
after randomisation for primary care participants
For studies conducted in the primary care setting, there was no
difference in days with restricted activities of daily living between
PCT and control group participants (days, 8.9 ± 4.2 versus 8.9
± 4.1, regression coefficient 0.07 (95% CI -0.44 to 0.59), P =
0.777).
5. Antibiotic-related side effects
There was also a significant reduction in antibiotic-related side
effects (16.3% versus 22.1%, adjusted OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to
0.82, P < 0.001). This outcome was only assessed in some of the
primary care and emergency department trials (n = 6), and not
in ICU trials. There was no evidence for subgroup effects (P for
interaction > 0.05).

Summary of main results
This updated systematic review and meta-analysis included 32 tri-
als, of which 26 trials were used for the main individual participant
data analysis. Trials were conducted in 12 countries and included
different clinical settings and types of respiratory infections. There
was mostly low risk for random sequence generation, allocation
concealment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting.
There was unclear risk in all studies for blinding of personnel,
and mostly high risk for blinding of outcome assessment. The
results indicate a significant reduction in mortality (high-quality
evidence according to GRADE, Summary of findings for the main
comparison) and non-significant result for treatment failure (mod-
erate-quality evidence according to GRADE, Summary offindings
for the main comparison) when PCT was used to guide initiation
and duration of antibiotic treatment in ARI participants compared
to control participants. Additionally, antibiotic consumption and
side effects from antibiotics were significantly reduced across dif-
ferent clinical settings and types of ARIs. There was no effect on
length of hospital stay and ICU length of stay. Results were similar
in subgroup and sensitivity analyses including an aggregate data
analysis with all 32 potentially eligible trials. Limitations include
incomplete individual participant data, with four research groups
not agreeing to the sharing of individual participant data; incom-
plete follow-up information in some of the trials where no out-
come assessment was done after 30 days of enrolment; differences
in definitions of treatment failure among trials; and exclusion of
some patient populations such as immunosuppressed people. Still,
results from this updated individual participant data meta-analysis
support the use of PCT in the context of antibiotic stewardship
in people with ARIs.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
20

 The strengths of our review include an explicit study protocol, a
comprehensive search to retrieve all relevant trials, access to in-
dividual participant-level data from all but four of the included
trials, and standardised outcome definitions across trials, thereby
overcoming limitations of meta-analyses using aggregated data. To
minimise the risk of data-driven associations, we prespecified a
limited number of prognostic factors and subgroup variables for
our statistical model. We allowed for potential clustering effects
by using random-effects models for included trials. Our results
proved robust in sensitivity analyses focusing on high-quality trials
and on participants with complete follow-up data.
The accuracy of PCT for diagnosing bacterial infections has
been called into question by previous meta-analyses of observa-
tional studies, which demonstrated mixed results (Jones 2007;
Simmonds 2005; Tang 2007; Uzzan 2006). However, a more re-
cent meta-analysis using positive culture as the reference method
found moderate to high discrimination of systematic inflamma-
tory response syndrome and sepsis (Wacker 2013). Since there are
no available gold standards for the diagnosis of the clinical condi-
tions included in our analysis, most studies used clinical consen-
sus criteria, which may differ among studies. Rather than relying
on these imperfect diagnostic criteria, we were able to assess the
value of PCT algorithms by means of RCTs measuring clinically
relevant, participant-level outcomes.
Despite these merits, this review has several limitations. We lim-
ited our analysis to adults with ARIs who were mostly immuno-
competent, and excluded some pathogens (i.e. Legionella or Pseu-
domonas infections). The results of these trials may therefore not
be generalised to people who are immunocompromised, with spe-
cific pathogens or infections other than ARIs, or children. Previ-
ous RCTs have shown that PCT guidance also reduces antibiotic
exposure in a neonatal sepsis population but not in children with
fever without a source (Manzano 2010). We found several ongo-
ing RCTs in children evaluating PCT algorithms that should shed
further light on the benefits and harms of PCT use for children.
The included trials compared the PCT strategy to a control group
where antibiotic therapy was guided based on ’usual practice’ or
based on current guideline recommendations. The magnitude of
antibiotic reduction obviously correlates strongly with antibiotic
prescription patterns, and in regions of low antibiotic prescription
the PCT strategy may have smaller effects.
Quality of the evidence
Characteristics of the individual trials are presented in Table 1.
Most trials had a follow-up of one month, with two trials assessing
outcome after14to21daysandseveral trialsfollowingparticipants
until hospital discharge (or ICU discharge) only. Procalcitonin al-
gorithms used in the different trials were similar in concept and
recommended initiation and/or continuation of antibiotic ther-
apy based on similar PCT cut-off levels (Table 1). However, there
were differences: some trials in primary care and the emergency
department used only a single PCT measurement on admission
to guide initiation of antibiotics (Burkhardt 2010; Christ-Crain
2004), while the other trials (predominantly in hospitalised par-
ticipants with severe infections) used repeated measurements for
guiding the duration of treatment. Adherence to algorithms was
variable. In terms of methodological quality, trials had concealed
allocation, but in several trials blinded outcome assessment was
not done. All trials achieved complete or near-complete follow-up
for mortality. None of the trials blinded participants or physicians
to group allocation. The overall quality of the evidence according
to GRADE was moderate to high (Summary of findings for the
main comparison).
Potential biases in the review process
Due to the differences in patient populations included in this
analysis, which ranged from primary care to the ICU, we adapted
the definition of treatment failure to clinical settings by including
setting-specific components in this composite outcome. This may
challenge the clinical interpretation in the overall analysis.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
While mortality did not differ significantly in our initial meta-
analysis (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23) (Schuetz 2012),
we found a significantly lower mortality rate in PCT-guided par-
ticipants in this update. This result was robust in subgroup anal-
yses and in our sensitivity analysis. Also, when considering all tri-
als in the aggregate data analysis, mortality tended to be reduced,
although not significantly (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01). Im-
portantly, the largest-yet ICU trial from the Netherlands has re-
ported a significantly lower mortality in PCT-guided participants
(De Jong 2016).
Two of the included individual trials reported reduced length of
stay, particularly within the ICU. Yet, despite a marked reduc-
tion in the duration of antibiotic therapy across trials and settings,
there was no difference in length of ICU and hospital stay between
the two groups in our comprehensive analysis. One might expect
that clinically stable patients with discontinued intravenous an-
tibiotics could be safely discharged unless there are extenuating
circumstances. Perceived needs by physicians to further monitor
these patients in the unit or inability to transfer patients to other
inpatient or aftercare locations may partly explain this finding.
There is ongoing controversy about the diagnostic performance of
PCT and other blood markers to correctly identify patients with a
bacterial infection. In fact, several observational studies have ques-
tioned the added value of PCT in addition to clinical signs, such
as a primary care study authored by van Vugt and colleagues re-
porting no additional benefit of PCT to a clinical assessment (van
Vugt 2013). Importantly, in the context of respiratory infections,
21

 diagnostic studies are limited by the lack of a reference standard,
with blood cultures only detecting a minority of cases (e.g. only
10% to 20% of patients with clinically and radiologically con-
firmed CAP have positive blood cultures) (Muller 2010; Wacker
2013). Interventional research, such as the trials included in the
current analysis, do not rely on a reference standard but compare
resource use (e.g. antibiotics) and clinical outcomes in people with
and without use of the diagnostic marker. For the primary care
setting, PCT had a very strong effect on antibiotic consumption
(reduction of antibiotic exposure by 70%, from 4.6 to 1.6 days)
without compromising disease resolution and patient safety. Of
note, we were not able to assess the effect of PCT on mortality due
to the very low risk situation with only one non-survivor (control
group) among the 1008 included participants.
The available evidence from RCTs, as summarised in this report,
supports the use of PCT for de-escalation of antibiotic therapy
for people with ARIs. The same may not be true for escalation
of antibiotic therapy when PCT levels increase as demonstrated
in a recent large sepsis trial (Jensen 2011), where PCT-guided
escalation of diagnostic procedures and antimicrobial therapy in
the ICU did not improve survival and led to organ-related harm
and prolonged ICU stays.

Implications for practice
Emerging bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotic agents calls for
more stringent efforts to reduce the empiric use of antimicrobial
agents in self limited and non-bacterial diseases and to shorten the
duration of antibiotic treatment in bacterial infection with clini-
cal resolution. The results of our study suggest that procalcitonin
(PCT) is a safe and effective tool to guide clinical decisions for
antibiotic initiation and duration of treatment. In all trials, PCT
was used to inform physicians about the need for initiation or dis-
continuation of antibiotic therapy, or both. However, there were
differences in PCT protocols among trials depending on the clin-
ical setting (see Table 1 for details about PCT recommendations
used in the individual trials) (Schuetz 2011a; Schuetz 2015). In
brief, PCT was mainly used to inform about initiation of antibi-
otic treatment in primary care trials, and re-measurement of PCT
was recommended in participants not being treated with antibi-
otics and not showing a resolution of illness at follow-up. In the
emergency room and hospital ward setting, PCT was used to in-
form about initiation of antibiotic treatment (mainly in low-risk
patients with bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease exacerbation), and also about discontinuation of treatment in
community-acquired pneumonia patients. In intensive care unit
patients, PCT was mainly used to monitor treatment and discon-
tinue antibiotics in participants with clinical improvement and a
drop in PCT levels. Thus for clinical practice, PCT should also
be adapted to clinical settings and the risk of patients - similar to
patients with suspicion of pulmonary embolism where D-dimer
levels are used differently depending on the pre-test probability
(Konstantinides 2008).
The use of PCT to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic
treatment in people with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was
associated with lower mortality rates and significantly reduced an-
tibiotic consumption and associated side effects across different
clinical settings and ARI diagnoses. Of note, mortality was very
low in primary care patients, and we were thus not able to assess
the effect of PCT on mortality. The use of PCT embedded in clin-
ical algorithms has the potential to improve the antibiotic man-
agement of ARI patients and has substantial clinical and public
health implications to reduce antibiotic exposure and the associ-
ated risk of antibiotic resistance. Several assays for the measure-
ment of PCT are currently available (Schuetz 2017), and the US
Food and Drug Administration recently cleared the Vidas assay,
among others, for antibiotic stewardship and prognostication of
patients using a PCT kinetics algorithm (Schuetz 2016). Impor-
tantly, all trials have used highly sensitive assays to measure PCT
in order to have optimal sensitivity and thus test performance.
Factors such as accessibility and time taken to get reports of the
tests are equally important in whether PCT will be used in the
clinical decision-making process for antibiotic therapy in ARIs. In
this regard, a point-of-care test would be important, especially for
the primary care setting (Kutz 2016).
Importantly, all trials included PCT into clinical algorithms, and
physicians could deviate from the PCT algorithm if needed. Post-
studysurveyshave beenpublishedinordertobetterunderstandthe
effects and challenges of PCT testing in clinical practice (Albrich
2012; Balk 2017).
Implications for research
Future studies should establish cost-effectiveness by considering
country-specific costs of PCT measurement (around USD 20 to
USD 30 per sample) and potential savings in consumption of
antibiotics and other healthcare resources (Stojanovic 2017).
In addition, it would be interesting to conduct a head-to-head
trial comparing a PCT strategy to a strategy based on another
biomarker, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or interleukin-6
(Meili 2015; Meili 2016). A similar randomised controlled trial
was recently conducted in primary care in the Netherlands with a
treatment algorithm based on either CRP levels, communication
training, or both, compared to a control group (Cals 2009). The
trial authors reported a 42% relative reduction in antibiotic use
with CRP guidance, which was similar to the effect of commu-
nication training in this setting. However, the usefulness of CRP
for antibiotic guidance outside the primary care setting is not yet
supported by controlled intervention trials.
While there is strong evidence for the use of PCT in respiratory in-
22

 fections, its role in other infections remains unclear. Several studies
have investigated PCT as a diagnostic and antibiotic stewardship
marker in different types of infections (Albrich 2012; Drozdov
2015; Sager 2017). However, larger trials powered for safety are
needed to understand the effect of PCT outside respiratory infec-
tions.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Annane 2013
Methods
Randomised, multicentre, single-blind clinical trial in 8 French ICUs
Participants
Inclusion criteria: Adults admitted to a participating ICU were eligible if they, < 48 h,
had SIRS, acute dysfunction of at least 1 organ, absence of indisputable clinical infection,
and negative microbial cultures
Exclusion criteria: Pregnancy, burns over ≥ 15% of body surface area, trauma, outpa-
tient or inpatient cardiac arrest, post-orthopaedic surgery status, drug-related neutrope-
nia, withdrawal of life-supportive therapies or a decision to withhold them, indisputable
clinical infection or antibiotic exposure ≥ 48 h during the time shortly before ICU
admission
Included in this study: 62/1250 screened patients were eligible for the study, of whom
31 were randomised to each arm. 4 post randomisation exclusion (4 withdrew their
consent)
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in ICU patients with non-microbiologically proven appar-
ent severe sepsis
Algorithm used in this study: In the experimental arm, both initiation and discon-
tinuation of antibiotics were guided by a PCT-based algorithm, applied at 6 h and on
day 3 and day 5 post randomisation. Briefly, antibiotic therapy was not to be started or
was to be halted when PCT was < 0.25 µg/L, was strongly discouraged when PCT was
≥ 0.25 to < 0.5 µg/L, was recommended when PCT was ≥ 0.5 to < 5 µg/L, and was
strongly recommended when PCT was ≥ 5 µg/L. Owing to the fact that surgery can
increase PCT levels, for 12 participants enrolled in the 48-hour postoperative period,
the respective PCT cut-offs were < 4 µg/L, ≥ 4 to < 9 µg/L, and ≥ 9 µg/L. Investigators
were strongly advised not to overrule the algorithm every day up to the study day 5. In
the control arm, the decision to start or stop antibiotic therapy was at the discretion of
the participant’s physician, without knowledge of the participant’s PCT concentrations
Outcomes
• proportion of participants receiving antibiotics at day 5 post randomisation
• death at day 5, at ICU discharge, and at hospital discharge
• proportion of participants started on antibiotics post randomisation
• duration of antibiotic exposure
• SOFA score at day 3 and day 5
• proportion of participants with infection acquired between randomisation and
day 3, day 5, and ICU discharge
• ICU and hospital length-of-stay
Notes
Funding: Research grant partly by Thermo Fisher B·R·A·H·M·S France. The sponsor
had no input in study design, conduct, or reporting.
Follow-up time: Until hospital discharge or 30 days’ post randomisation, whichever
came first
Registration: NCT01025180

Bias
Authors’ judgement
Support for judgement
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Low risk
Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ra-
tio according to a computer-generated list.
Randomisation was centralised through a
secured web site and performed by an in-
dependent statistician
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Low risk
Centralised randomisation using permuta-
tion blocks
Blinding of participants and personnel
(performance bias)
All outcomes
Unclear risk
The control arm remained blinded to PCT
levels. Masking of antibiotic therapy was
not feasible in this study
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection
bias)
All outcomes
High risk
Investigators remained blinded to PCT lev-
els in the control arm, but no blinding of
overall outcome assessment was mentioned
in the study
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
Follow-up for participants on antibiotic on
day 5 was: 58/62. 4 participants withdrew
their consent
Selective reporting (reporting bias)

Methods
Randomised, investigator-initiated, multicentre, partially blinded clinical trial, in 33
multidisciplinary ICUs across Germany
Participants
Inclusion criteria: Adults with severe sepsis or septic shock (severe sepsis was defined
as SIRS caused by infection combined with acute organ dysfunction. Septic shock was
defined as sepsis in combination with arterial hypotension or need for vasopressor therapy
despite adequate fluid resuscitation)
Exclusion criteria: Pregnant or lactating women, patients with selenium intoxication,
individuals with infections for which guidelines recommend a longer duration of an-

timicrobial therapy, immunocompromised patients, and those without commitment to
full therapy or where death was imminent owing to coexisting diseases were excluded
from the trial.
Included in this study: 1180 participants were randomised; 91 participants were ex-
cluded from the final analysis because informed consent was not obtainable in the de-
ferred consent process, resulting in 1089 participants with valid data
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions and effect of sodium selenite administration in people with
severe sepsis or septic shock
Algorithm used in this study: Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, participants were randomly
assigned to receive intravenous sodium selenite or placebo as well as antimicrobial therapy
guided by a PCT algorithm or conventional antimicrobial therapy.
In participants randomised to the PCT guidance arm, PCT was measured locally on
days 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 after randomisation if the participant was still in the ICU.
Procalcitonin concentration on day 0 or day 1 served as the baseline value. Depending
on the PCT results, an algorithm provided recommendations to change or discontinue
antimicrobial therapy or trigger diagnostic procedures to optimise source control. On
day 4, no change in antimicrobial therapy was recommended if the PCT level dropped
by at least 50% compared with the baseline value. Otherwise, change or optimisation
of antimicrobial therapy or interventions regarding source control were recommended.
On the other days, stopping antimicrobial therapy was recommended if the PCT level
was 1 ng/mL or lower or if the PCT level dropped by at least 50% compared with the
previous value. Otherwise, change or optimisation of antimicrobial therapy or interven-
tions regarding source control were recommended. The treating physician was allowed
to overrule the algorithm recommendation.
In the group without PCT guidance, no PCT measurements were obtained until day 14;
changes in antimicrobial therapy were made at the discretion of the treating physician.
Investigators agreed to treat all participants according to the Guidelines of the Germany
Sepsis Society, which included recommendations to re-evaluate antimicrobial therapy
after 48 to 72 hours and to restrict duration of antimicrobial therapy to no more than
10 days
Outcomes
• death from any cause by 28 days after inclusion
• 90-day all-cause mortality
• mean total SOFA score and its sub scores
• duration of ICU and hospital stay
• ventilator-, vasopressor-, and dialysis-free days until day 90
• duration and costs of antimicrobial therapy
• duration until change of antimicrobial therapy
• antimicrobial exposure days
• days free of antimicrobial therapy
• frequency of surgical source control
• frequency of diagnostic procedures for localisation of the infection focus
• clinical and microbiologic treatment response
• secondary infections
• emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria

Methods
Single-centre, randomised, open-label clinical trial in Rochester, NY, USA
Participants
Inclusion criteria: Adults ≥ 21 years of age with symptoms compatible with LRTI (i.e.
admission diagnosis of pneumonia, acute exacerbations of COPD, bronchitis, asthma,
influenza, viral syndrome, respiratory failure, and congestive heart failure CHF) were
identified by reviewing the daily admission census.
Exclusion criteria: Patients with characteristics indicative of a high risk for bacterial
infection (i.e. ICU requirement, active chemotherapy or radiation, immunosuppression,
definitive infiltrate onchestradiograph, enrolmentsystolicbloodpressure of <90mmHg,
and ≥ 15% band forms in peripheral blood). Patients who had conditions known to
increase PCT levels (i.e. trauma, renal failure, and pancreatitis) or who had received
antibiotics prior to admission were also excluded.
Included in this study: 300/685 screened patients were eligible for the study, of whom
151 were randomised to the intervention group and 149 to the non-intervention group
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in hospitalised patients with respiratory infections
Algorithm used in this study: In the intervention group serum PCT and viral/atypical
pathogen PCR testing were performed on admission (in addition to all standard-of-
care diagnostic tests). Antibiotic decisions were made based on a PCT algorithm (for
PCT values of ≤ 0.1 ng/mL, initiation of antibiotic treatment is strongly discouraged;

for values of 0.11 to 0.24 ng/mL, initiation is discouraged; for values of 0.25 to 0.49
ng/mL, initiation is encouraged; and for values of ≥ 0.5 ng/ mL, initiation is strongly
encouraged). In the standard care group standard-of-care testing (bacterial and viral
cultures of respiratory samples, hospital influenza/RSV duplex PCR, and urine Legionella
antigen analysis) were obtained on admission and antibiotic decisions were made by the
attending physician. Participants in the standard care group had PCT and viral testing
samples frozen and tested at study termination
Outcomes

Methods
Randomised clinical trial, multicentre in 53 primary care practices in northwest Switzer-
land
Participants
Inclusion criteria: People with upper or lower ARIs in primary care and the physician’s
intention to prescribe antibiotics on the basis of evidence-based guidelines
Exclusion criteria: Antibiotic use within the previous 28 days, psychiatric disorders or
inability to give written informed consent, not being available for follow-up, not fluent
in German, severe immunosuppression, cystic fibrosis, active tuberculosis, and the need
for immediate hospitalisation
Included in this analysis: 458 out of 458 randomised participants
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in primary care with repeated measurements
Algorithm used in this study: In participants with PCT levels lower than 0.1 µg/L, a
bacterial infection was considered highly unlikely and the use of ABs was discouraged. In
participants with a PCT level higher than 0.25 µg/L, a bacterial infection was considered
likely and the use of ABs was recommended. For PCT concentrations of 0.1 to 0.25 µg/
L, a bacterial infection was considered unlikely and the use of ABs was not recommended.
When ABs were withheld from participants, a second measurement of the PCT level was
mandatory within 6 to 24 hours for safety reasons. The use of ABs was recommended if
this second measurement was higher than 0.25 µg/L or if the PCT level had increased
from the first measurement by more than 50% and the participant showed no clinical
improvement. All participants given ABs based on PCT level were reassessed after 3 days.
Discontinuation of AB treatment was then recommended in participants with a PCT
level of 0.25 µg/L or lower
Outcomes
• number of days, within the first 14 days after baseline, during which a participant’s
daily activities (work or recreation) were restricted by a respiratory tract infection
• degree of discomfort from infection (scored on a scale from 0 (no discomfort) to
10 (a great deal of discomfort)) at 14 days
• days of work missed within 14 days
• days with adverse effects from medication (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting,
skin rash) within 14 days

Algorithm used in this study: A PCT value of 0.1 to 0.25 µg/L was regarded as an
indication that bacterial infection was unlikely and use of ABs was discouraged. A serum
PCT between 0.25 and 0.5 g/L was deemed indicative of a possible bacterial infection,
and the treating doctor was advised to initiate antimicrobial treatment. A PCT value of
0.5 µg/L or greater was judged suggestive of the presence of bacterial infection and AB
treatment was strongly recommended. For participants on antimicrobial therapy at the
time of admission, discontinuation of ABs was recommended if PCT concentrations
were less than 0.25 µg/L
Outcomes

Corti 2016
Methods
Randomised, single-centre clinical trial in an ED of a university hospital in Denmark
Participants
Inclusion criteria: 1) 18 years old and 2) admitted with an AECOPD (clinician’s diag-
nosis at admission), defined according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive
Lung Disease (GOLD)
Exclusion criteria: 1) person unable to understand or respond to oral or written infor-
mation; 2) previously been enrolled in the study; and 3) do-not-resuscitate order in place
Included in this analysis: 120/630 screened people with AECOPD were randomised
and used for the ITT analysis (62 in the PCT group, 58 in the control group)
Interventions
The aim was to assess whether PCT-guided antibiotic treatment could reduce the overall
use of antibiotics among people hospitalised for AECOPD.
Algorithm used in this study: In the control group, antibiotic therapy followed treat-
ment strategies for AECOPD according to GOLD guidelines. In the PCT group, initi-
ation or continuation of antibiotics was strongly discouraged if PCT was 0.15 ng/mL or
lower and discouraged if levels were between 0.15 ng/mL and 0.25 ng/mL. Initiation or
continuation of antibiotics was encouraged if PCT was > 0.25 ng/mL. In participants
with PCT over 5 ng/mL on admission, the algorithm recommended stopping antibiotics
when PCT levels decreased by 80% of the peak value
Outcomes
• fraction of participants using antibiotics for at least 5 days within 28 days after
inclusion
• cumulative number of days with any antibiotic therapy within 28 days
• fraction of participants using antibiotics for a) at least 1 day, b) at least 3 days, c)
at least 7 days
• length of hospital stay
• adverse events (composite endpoint of mortality, readmission, ICU admission all

Methods
Randomised, multicentre, controlled, open-label intervention trial in 15 hospitals in the
Netherlands
Participants
Inclusion criteria: Eligible patients had to be at least 18 years of age, be admitted to
the ICU, and have received their first dose of antibiotics no longer than 24 h before
inclusion to the trial for an assumed or proven infection.
Exclusion criteria: Patients were excluded in cases of systemic antibiotics as prophylaxis
only, antibiotics solely as part of selective decontamination of the digestive tract, pro-
longed therapy (e.g. endocarditis), expected ICU stay of less than 24 h, severe immuno-
suppression, severe infections (due to viruses, parasites, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis),
and moribund patients. Patients who received corticosteroids were not excluded.
Included in this study: 1575/4507 screened patients were enrolled in the study (776
in the PCT group, 799 in the control group) for an intention-to-treat analysis
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in critically ill ICU patients
Algorithm used in this study: Antibiotics in the standard-of care group were stopped
according to local or national guidelines and according to the discretion of attending

physicians. Procalcitonin concentration was not measured in the standard-of-care group.
For participants randomly assigned to the PCT-guided group, once-a-day measurements
of PCT concentrations were taken and made available to the attending physicians, in-
cluding a baseline measurement as close to initiation of antibiotics as possible, at least
within 24 h. The study protocol advised stopping the prescribed antibiotics if PCT con-
centration had decreased by 80% or more of its peak value (relative stopping threshold)
or when it reached a value of 0.5 µg/L or lower (absolute stopping threshold). The
attending physician was free to decide whether to continue antibiotic treatment in par-
ticipants who had reached these thresholds
Outcomes
• consumption of antibiotics (expressed as defined daily doses)
• duration of antibiotic treatment (defined as the number of 24-hour periods
between start and end of antibiotic treatment)
• percentage of participants who had a recurrent infection
• length of stay in hospital and ICU
• costs of antibiotics
• costs of PCT tests

Methods
Randomised, single-centre, controlled clinical trial at an ICU of a tertiary care, private
hospital in São Paulo, Brazil
Participants
Inclusion criteria: People with microbiologically confirmed infections (blood, urine,
tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures) with sepsis, severe sepsis, and
septic shock
Exclusion criteria were: Onset of antibiotic therapy more than 48 hours before the
date when the cultures were performed; people under 18 years old; known pregnancy;
infections requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy, such as bacterial endocarditis, hepatic
or brain abscess, deep abscess, mediastinitis, and osteomyelitis; severe infection caused
by viruses, parasites, fungi, or mycobacteria; chronic localised infections, such as chronic
osteomyelitis or chronic prostatitis; people without indication for ICU admission, as
determined by the attending physician; and negative cultures (blood, urine, tracheal
aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) in people with suspected sepsis, severe sepsis,
or septic shock
Included in this study: 81/265 eligible patients randomised for a intention-to-treat
analysis; after further exclusions, 51/265 patients remained for per-protocol analysis
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in ICU patients with proven bacterial infection
Algorithm used in this study: All participants received antibiotic therapy. For the con-
trol group, stopping antibiotic therapy was at the discretion of the attending physician.
For the intervention group, physicians were guided by the PCT protocol to stop antibi-
otic treatment. The protocol stated 2 conditions: 1) PCT dropped more than 90% from
the peak level, or 2) an absolute value < 0.5 ng/mL was reached
Outcomes
• duration of antibiotic therapy
• in-hospital mortality
• ICU mortality
• ICU length of stay
• recurrence of the initial infection
• analysis of the CRP levels along with the PCT protocol
• therapy costs
Notes
Funding: No funding declared in the main article.
Follow-up time: Data were recorded from 2 days before the bacteraemia (when appli-
cable), with day 0 defined as the day sepsis was diagnosed, until 14 days after or at ICU
discharge, whichever came first.

lavage; (6) exclusion of left heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and identifiable cause of
acute lung injury.
Exclusion criteria: Patients treated with antibiotics during the previous 2 weeks were
excluded.
Included in this study: 68 of 78 randomised participants finished at follow-up.
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in people with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis
Algorithm used in this study: Serum PCT level was measured every 3 days. The first
PCT measurement was available before the clinical decision to start antibiotics treat-
ment. Participants whose serum PCT value exceeded the threshold of 0.25 ng/mL were
administered antibiotics and were treated until PCT value fell to ≤ 0.25 ng/mL. In the
routine treatment group, the decision to administer antibiotics was guided by the clinical
experience of the clinician, typically by conventional laboratory tests such as sputum
bacteriology and white blood cell count
Outcomes
• length of hospitalisation
• the numbers of participants exposed to antibiotics treatment
• duration of antibiotic treatment
• cases of mechanical ventilation

Methods
Randomised clinical trial, multicentre, 3 hospitals in Denmark
Participants
Inclusion criteria: Hospitalised patients with suspected pneumonia (no X-ray confir-
mation); quote: “The assessment of eligibility (i.e. the clinical diagnosis) was made by
the admitting physician and was based on medical history and physical examination.”
Exclusion criteria: Not meeting the diagnostic criteria
Included in this analysis: 210 out of 223 randomised participants; 13 post randomisa-
tion exclusions (3 no PCT testing, 6 not meeting inclusion criteria, 4 withdrew informed
consent)
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in CAP patients with initial values only
Algorithm used in this study: Physicians were not asked to wait for PCT results before
initiating antimicrobial therapy, therefore PCT values were, in most cases, used to mo-
tivate either cessation or continuation of already initiated treatments. Discontinuation
of AB treatment was recommended if PCT at admission was below 0.25 µg/L, despite
delays in test results
Outcomes
• antibiotic use
• mortality
• ICU admission

Algorithm used in this study: According to the proposal by Mueller and colleagues, for
participantsinthe PCTgroup, the use of antibioticswas more orlessstronglydiscouraged
if PCT level was < 0.25 µg/L or 0.50 µg/L, respectively, and more or less recommended
if PCT level was above 1 µg/L or 0.50 µg/L, respectively. This strategy was applied to
all infectious episodes encountered during participants’ ICU stay
Outcomes
• difference of antibiotic consumption between the PCT group and the control
group
• usefulness of PCT levels in the ICU diagnostic algorithm in deciding whether or
not to initiate antibiotics whenever infection was suspected and determination of
concordance of the infection’s diagnostic ratings by the ICU physician and the

endocarditis, osteomyelitis); grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis, since this condition increases
the risk of S aureus bacteraemia; and pregnancy
Included in this study: 62 randomised participants, 1 post randomisation exclusion
due to withdrawal of informed consent
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in people with febrile neutropenia
Algorithm used in this study: Attending physicians were encouraged to discontinue
antibiotics in participants when both of the following criteria were met: (i) no febrile
episodes for 2 consecutive days (if no Ionger neutropenia) or 3 consecutive days (if still
neutropenia), and (ii) PCT concentration at least 90% lower than highest baseline Ievels
or lower than 0.5 ng/mL for 2 consecutive days, regardless of the initial Ievels. The final
decision to discontinue antibiotics was left at the attending physician’s discretion. Pro-
calcitonin Ievels were measured for 2 additional days following antibiotics interruption
to monitor a possible relapse of infection. For safety reasons, at least 5 days of antibiotic
therapy were ensured for all included participants. Participants with bacteraemia were
treated for at least 7 days. In the control group, duration of antibiotic therapy was based
on institutional protocol, according to Infectious Diseases Society of America recom-
mendations
Outcomes
• antibiotic exposure, measured by the duration of the first course of antibiotic
therapy (in days) and days without antibiotics during follow-up (28 days)
• clinical cure rate
• infection relapse rate (infection diagnosed 48 h or more after antibiotic
discontinuation)
• superinfection rate (defined as occurrence of infection due to 1 or more different
pathogens, in the same or in another site, during the first antibiotic therapy)
• length of hospital stay from inclusion (in days)
• all-cause 28- and 90-day mortality

Algorithm used in this study: Antibiotic treatment was strongly discouraged when
serum PCT level was less than 0.1 µg/L; antibiotic treatment was discouraged when
serum PCT level was less than 0.25 µg/L; and antibiotic treatment was encouraged
when serum PCT level was higher than 0.25 µg/L. When antibiotics were withheld from
participants, a second measurement of the PCT level was mandatory within 6 to 24 hours
for safety reasons. The use of antibiotics was recommended if this second measurement
was higher than 0.25 µg/L. Physicians were permitted to overrule the algorithm, but
they had to indicate the reasons for overruling. The control group received antibiotic
according to the discretion of the treating physician, who was unaware of the participant’s
PCT levels
Outcomes
• antibiotic use, expressed as rate of antibiotic prescriptions in percentage and
relative risk of antibiotic exposure
• measures of treatment success
• length of hospital stay
• clinical, laboratory, and spirometry outcomes at discharge
• results of spirometry at the 12-month follow-up examination, as well as the results
of the Asthma Control Test, the results of the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire at
the 12-month follow-up visit

Methods
Randomised, single-centre, open-label, controlled clinical trial at a 200-bed academic
tertiary care hospital in Belgrade, Serbia
Participants
Inclusion criteria: People scheduled to undergo open heart surgery on cardio-pulmonal
bypass. We assessed people who were selected for elective cardiac surgery at the 200-bed
academic tertiary care hospital. The criterion for inclusion in the study was the type of
operation: coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, valve reconstruction, com-
bined CABG and valve procedures. Entry criteria included stable and unstable angina

pectoris, valve insufficiency, left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) above 30%, and epi-
demiological status with saprophyte bacteria.
Exclusion criteria: People selected for redo cardiac operations, thoracic aortic surgery,
as well as people having active endocarditis and people with LVEF < 30%. People with
preoperative signs of infection (leukocyte count > 12,000/L; body temperature > 38°C)
were also excluded.
Included in this study: 205/205 included participants finished for follow-up (102 PCT
group/103 standard group)
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in patients after cardiac surgery
Algorithm used in this study: Antibiotic prophylaxis was performed in all participants.
The participants were divided at the time of surgery into the standard group and the
PCT group.
In the standard group, the antibiotic use was applied according to the criteria based on
the laboratory and clinical signs; no antibiotic therapy was administrated routinely in
the absence of clinical signs of infection or a bacteriologic positive sample.
In the PCT group, the use of antibiotics was encouraged or discouraged on the basis of
serum PCT concentrations. A serum PCT concentration of 0.5 ng/mL or less indicated
the absence of bacterial infection, at which point the use of antibiotics was discouraged
Outcomes
• proportion of participants treated with antibiotics
• overall cost of antibiotics per 1 patient
• total cost of antibiotics per 1 hospital day after operation
• ICU stays and hospital stay
• rehospitalisation
• incidence of infections
• severe non-infection complications
• mortality rate

Participants
Inclusion criteria: Patients with at least 2 of 4 criteria including body temperature above
38°C or below 36°C; tachycardia > 90/min; tachypnoea > 20/min; and leukocytosis >
12 × 109/L or a leftward shift with more than 10% band cells or leukopenia < 4 × 109/
L were defined as patient with SIRS.
Exclusion criteria: Documented infection, pus from wound or abscess, empyema,
thrombophlebitis, infection due to viral or parasites, hypoxaemia (PO2 < 60 mmHg),
oliguria (urine output < 30 mL/h), Glasgow Coma Scale 3 without sedation, parenteral
antibiotic usage 24 hours before admission to ICU, hospitalisation 48 hours before en-
rolment, conditions requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy such as endocarditis, chronic
localised infection such as osteomyelitis, and severely immunocompromised patients
Included in this study: 60 participants were randomised (30 in the intervention group
and 30 in the control group)
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in critically ill ICU patients
Algorithm used in this study: In case group, according to serum level of PCT, par-
ticipants were divided into 3 groups as: PCT level 0.5 ng/mL or less (group A), PCT
value of 0.5 to 2 ng/mL (group B), and PCT level 2 ng/mL or more (group C). Group
A indicated a low probability of bacterial infection; use of antibiotics was discouraged,
and PCT level was rechecked after 12 hours. In group B, with a medium probability of
infection, antibiotic therapy was not administered, and PCT level was rechecked after 8
hours. In group C, with a high probability of bacterial infection, participants underwent
antibiotic treatment. If the PCT level was higher than 2 ng/mL after recheck in group A
and B, antibiotics therapy was administered; if the PCT level was lower than 2 ng/mL,
participants underwent close observation, and PCT was rechecked until culture results
were obtained
Outcomes
• use of antibiotic treatment
• change in clinical status
• early mortality

• withholding of life-support
• absence of antimicrobial treatment despite clinical suspicion of sepsis
Included in this analysis: 52 out of 79 randomised participants; 27 not considered for
this analysis due to a diagnosis other than RTI
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in ICU patients with repeated measurements
Algorithm used in this study: Procalcitonin levels measured at baseline and daily. For
participants presenting a favourable clinical course, investigators used predefined “stop-
ping rules” based on circulating PCT levels to encourage physicians to discontinue ABs.
Participants with baseline PCT level ≥ 1 µg/L were re-evaluated at day 5. Investigators
encouraged treating physicians to discontinue ABs when:
1. PCT dropped more than 90% from the baseline peak level; or
2. an absolute value below 0.25 µg/L was reached.
Participants with PCT level below 1 µg/L at baseline were re-evaluated at day 3; treating
physicians were encouraged to discontinue ABs when PCT level was below 0.1 µg/L and
careful clinical evaluation ruled out severe infection
Outcomes
• all-cause mortality at day 28
• clinical cure defined as clinical signs and symptoms present at baseline that had
resolved by the final clinical assessment
• reoccurrence of the initial infection
• length of ICU stay

Ogasawara 2014
Methods
Randomised, single-centre, prospective, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial in
Shizuoka, Japan
Participants
Inclusion criteria: Patients at risk for aspiration, who had been hospitalised after devel-
oping pneumonia, were enrolled. Aspiration pneumonia was clinically diagnosed on the
basis of the findings on computed tomography (e.g. bronchopneumonia in the dorsal
lower lobes), combined with a history of aspiration pneumonia, stroke or dementia, poor
systemic condition, or any combination of these (e.g. bedridden patients or patients
fed by a nasogastric tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). Selection criteria
included the following: at least 1 month had elapsed since the last treatment for relapsed
pneumonia, and ventilator use was not scheduled for the pneumonia treatment
Exclusion criteria: Patients with a known severe allergy to any drugs; patients with sepsis
or a severe infectious disease; patients with severe underlying diseases (e.g. malignancy,
COPD, heart failure) that affected the prognosis; and patients who could not safely have
cessation of oral intake or hydration as a treatment for aspiration pneumonia because of
dementia
Included in this study: The study enrolled 105 participants; 2 participants withdrew
their informed consent, 5 were excluded because of other final diagnoses, and 1 was
excluded because of a defect in the PCT data. The ITT population thus comprised 96
participants: 48 in the PCT group and 48 in the control group
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in patients with aspiration pneumonia and assessment of
the continuation of oral intake
Algorithm used in this study: Procalcitonin levels were measured via outsourcing to
SRL (Tokyo, Japan); the results were obtained 2 or 3 days after admission. In the PCT
group, if the PCT levels upon admission were < 0.5 ng/mL, 0.5 to 1.0 ng/mL, or >
1.0 ng/mL, the duration of antibiotic therapy was determined to be 3, 5, or 7 days,
respectively. If the PCT level upon admission was 45.0 ng/mL, antibiotic treatment was
continued until it was less than 10% of the peak PCT level reached.
In the control group, antibiotic therapy followed the recommendations of the Japanese
Respiratory Society guideline for management of community-acquired pneumonia in
adults. Antibiotic therapy was discontinued if 3 of the following 4 criteria were met:
fever declined (body temperature < 37.0°C), normalisation of leukocyte count, decrease
in the CRP level to 30% of the maximum, and an obvious improvement as observed
by chest radiography. In both groups, the choice of antibiotic regimen was left to the
discretion of the treating physician
Outcomes
• primary non-inferiority endpoint was a composite of a relapse of aspiration
pneumonia and death from any cause occurring within 30 days of admission
• antibiotic exposure
• adverse events from antibiotic therapy

Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in critically ill patients in the ICU with undifferentiated
infection or suspected sepsis
Algorithm used in this study: Cessation of antibiotics was recommended if initial or
any subsequent PCT was negative (<0.10 ng/mL) or if initial or any subsequent PCT was
between 0.10 to 0.25 ng/mL, and infection was highly unlikely; Subsequent PCT level
declined more than 90% from baseline, and 2. Assess antibiotic appropriateness and/
or adequacy of source control if PCT level at 48 hours is 70% of baseline value. Daily
PCT results were made available to the treating clinician for participants randomised
to the PCT group. Antibiotic prescription in both the standard care and PCT groups
was according to the Australian Antibiotics Therapeutic Guidelines and the antimicro-
bial stewardship (implemented by infectious diseases twice-weekly rounds and on-need
consultations). The algorithm was implemented only in the ICU
Outcomes

came first after randomisation
• antibiotic-free days at day 28 after randomisation
• number of antibiotic daily defined doses at day 28
• ICU and hospital length of stay
• mortality and 90-day all-cause mortality
• additional a priori outcomes included the relationship between baseline (taken at
randomisation) PCT and sepsis severity, microbiologically confirmed infections within

Methods
Randomised clinical trial, single-centre, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland
Participants
Inclusion criteria: Clinical diagnosis of COPD exacerbation
Exclusion criteria: People who were considered to be vulnerable study participants (i.
e. those with psychiatric comorbidity) were excluded from the study. Other exclusion
criteria were immunosuppression, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and the presence of infiltrates
on chest radiographs on hospital admission
Included in this analysis: 208 out of 226 randomised participants; 18 post randomi-
sation exclusions due to absence of COPD according to GOLD criteria
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in COPD patients with repeated measurements
Algorithm used in this study: Procalcitonin level of 0.1 µg/L was considered indicative
of the absence of bacterial infection, and the use of ABs was discouraged. A level of 0.1 to
0.25 µg/L indicated possible bacterial infection, and the use of ABs was discouraged or
encouraged, respectively, based on the stability of the participant’s clinical condition. A
PCT level of 0.25 µg/L was considered suggestive of the presence of bacterial infection,
and AB treatment was encouraged

Randomised clinical trial, multicentre with 7 European and US intensive care units
Participants
Inclusion criteria: VAP when intubated for > 48 h
Exclusion criteria: Patients were excluded it they 1) were pregnant; 2) were enrolled in
another trial; 3) had received immunosuppressants or long-term corticosteroid therapy
(> 0.5 mg/kg per day for > 1 month); 4) were severely immunosuppressed, including
AIDS; or 5) had a coexisting extrapulmonary infection diagnosed between day 1 and 3
requiring antibiotic therapy for > 3 days
Included in this analysis: 101 (101) (100%)
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in VAP patients with repeated measurements
Algorithm used in this study: A PCT level of < 0.25 µg/L suggested the absence of
VAP
, and discontinuation of ABs was strongly encouraged. A PCT level between 0.25
µg/L and 0.5 µg/L or a decrease by ≥ 80% as compared to day 0 indicated that bacterial
infection was unlikely, and reduction or discontinuation of ABs was encouraged. A PCT
level ≥ 0.5 µg/L or decrease by < 80% as compared to day 0 was considered indicative of
unresolved bacterial infection, and reduction or discontinuation of AB was discouraged.
A PCT level of > 1 µg/L strongly suggested unresolved bacterial infection, and AB
discontinuation was strongly discouraged
Outcomes
• antibiotic-free days alive
• any antibiotic exposure after inclusion, i.e. total antibiotic exposure days and total
antibiotic agent days, regardless of indication
• the number of mechanical ventilation-free days
• the number of ICU-free days alive
• the evolution of the signs and symptoms potentially linked to pulmonary infection
• SaO2, PaO2/FiO2
• the evolution of the SOFA, ODIN, and CPIS scores
• length of hospital stay
• the VAP-related clinical deterioration rate and overall mortality at 28 days

Methods
Randomised, multicentre, open, controlled, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial involv-
ing 18 university/city hospital pulmonary departments in Italy
Participants
Inclusion criteria: Study participants were male or female, 18 years of age, current or
former smokers, and diagnosed with COPD stages I-IV as defined by GOLD guidelines
available at the time the study was designed, with protocol deviation. Participants were
hospitalised for severe ECOPD requiring antibiotic treatment, i.e. type 1 exacerbation
(increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence verified by the attending
clinician) according to Anthonisen, and/or characterised by respiratory failure. Exacer-
bation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was defined as “an acute event charac-
terised by a worsening of the patient’s respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-
to-day variations and leads to a change in medication”.
Exclusion criteria: Bronchial asthma, unstable concomitant disease (cardiovascular, re-
nal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, neurological, metabolic, musculoskeletal, neoplastic, res-
piratory, or other disease), pregnancy and breastfeeding, clinically significant laboratory
abnormalities suggestive of unstable concomitant disease, survival for 1 year unlikely,
and inability to give written consent. Antibiotic pretreatment before hospital admission
and radiographic signs of pneumonia did not preclude eligibility for the study.
Included in this study: 183 participants were randomised, of which 178 participants,
88 in the PCT group and 90 in the standard care group, were analysed
Interventions
Guiding antibiotic decisions in people with severe exacerbations of COPD
Algorithm used in this study: On admission, all patients received a 3-day course of
antibiotics (either amoxicillin plus clavulanate or quinolones) according to 2005 inter-
national guidelines. Procalcitonin levels were measured on hospital admission, on day
1, and on day 2. On day 2 each eligible patient was randomly assigned to 1 of the 2
treatment plans.
quote “Participants randomised to the standard group continued antibiotic therapy for
10 days, whereas participants randomised to the PCT group either continued treatment
for 10 days or stopped on day 3, depending on their PCT levels, according to previously
recommended cut-off values. Specifically, participants continued antibiotic treatment
for 10 days if 1 or more of the PCT values on the first 3 days of hospitalisation were 0.25
µg/L. When PCT values were < 0.25 µg/L but > 0.1 µg/L on any occasion, antibiotic
treatment was continued for 10 days if participants were clinically unstable or had acute
respiratory failure; otherwise, treatment was stopped on day 3. If all PCT values were
consistently < 0.1 µg/L, treatment was stopped on day 3.”
All participants were also treated with systemic corticosteroids for 14 days, plus regular
inhaled short-acting or long-acting bronchodilators
Outcomes
• percentage of participants with at least 1 exacerbation within 6 months after the
index exacerbation
• hospital readmission
• admission to the ICU
• change in lung function (�FEV1)
• length of hospital stay
• death from any cause
Notes
Funding: The trial was approved and funded by the Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA)
, the Italian agency for drugs, which is an official body of the Italian Ministry of Health.

• symptoms assessed by visual analogue scale (at hospital admission, 3 days after
hospitalisation, and on the day of hospital discharge)
• length of hospital stay
• intubation rate
• mortality during hospitalisation and the 30-day follow-up period
• rate of antibiotic use
• readmission due to AECOPD in the 30-day follow-up period

(Continued)
Interventions
Algorithm used in this study:
Experimental: Optimal PEEP patients submitted to general anaesthesia and open radical cystectomy and
urinary diversion (20 participants) will be submitted an alveolar recruitment maneuver using the sustained
airway pressure by the CPAP method, applying 30 cmH2O PEEP for 30 seconds followed by a decremental
PEEP titration procedure directed by static pulmonary compliance (Cstat). During PEEP titration procedure,
PEEP will be decreased from 14 cmH2O by 2 cmH2O every 4 minutes, until a final PEEP of 6 cmH2O.
Optimal PEEP is considered to be a PEEP value resulting the highest possible Cstat measured by ventilator.
After PEEP titration procedure, a lung protective mechanical ventilation will be performed using optimal
PEEP and low tidal volumes
Active comparator: Standard PEEP
. Patients submitted to general anaesthesia and open radical cystectomy and
urinary diversion (20 participants) will be submitted an alveolar recruitment manoeuvre using the sustained
airway pressure by the CPAP method, applying 30 cmH2O PEEP for 30 seconds followed by a standard lung
protective mechanical ventilation using a PEEP value of 6 cmH2O and low tidal volumes (6 mL/kg)
Outcomes
• Postoperative Pulmonary Complications: new infiltrates or atelectasis on chest X-ray, abnormal
breathing sounds on auscultation, excessive bronchial secretions, unexplained fever, respiratory failure or
need for non-invasive or invasive ventilatory support.
• Procalcitonin Kinetics: serum procalcitonin levels during and after surgery

Procalcitonin to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections, 22 October
2017
Summary
In the 2012 update of this review (Schuetz, 2012), (Maravic-Stojkovic, 2011) was excluded due to “[no] evidence of respiratory
infection”. In this 2017 update, (Maravic-Stojkovic, 2011) has now been included. The reasons for this change do not seem to be
explicitly provided in the review. The “What’s new” section does say “new trials” were included but (Maravic-Stojkovic, 2011) had
already been published, identified and excluded in the previous review.

Based on the 2012 review of abstracts we did not believe that the Maravic dataset would have “patients with acute respiratory tract
infection included” (our main inclusion criterion) based on the description in the abstract “The prospective study included 205 patients
124

 who underwent open heart surgery. The patients were randomly assigned for procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment (PCT-group; n=
102) or standard care (standard group; n=103). On the basis of serum procalcitonin concentrations, usage of antibiotics was encouraged
(PCT≥0.5 ng/mL) or discouraged.”
For the 2017 update we decided to check again all trials with investigators and indeed found that 5 out of the 205 patients had hospital-
acquired pneumonia (HAP) - these 5 patients were then included in the final analysis.
Thus - the 5 patients from the Maravic study should have been included in the 2012 review already but slipped our attention due to
the focus of the study on cardiac surgery patients.

We updated our searches and analyses. We included 12
new trials in individual participant analysis (Bloos 2016;

excluded from individual participant analysis (Annane
2013; Ding 2013; Lima 2016; Najafi 2015; Ogasawara
2014; Tang 2013). We identified seven new ongoing tri-

NCT02931409). Our new results show that mortality
is significantly lower in the procalcitonin group

Philipp Schuetz received support (paid to his employer) from Thermo Fisher, Roche Diagnostics, Abbott and bioMerieux to attend
meetings and fulfil speaking engagements. These conflicts breach Cochrane’s Commercial Sponsorship Policy (Clause 3), therefore
Philipp Schuetz will step down as lead author at the next update of the review. Dr Schuetz’s declared conflicts were referred to the
Funding Arbiter Panel and Cochrane’s Deputy Editor-in-Chief who have agreed this course of action but as an exception which does
not set a precedent for similar situations in the future.
Beat Mueller reports that within the last 3 years he was part of the speaker bureau of B·R·A·H·M·S and bioMérieux to give educational

We changed the co-primary endpoint of combined disease-specific failure at 30 days (mentioned in the protocol) to setting-specific
treatment failure at 30 days as defined above for reasons of standardisation across trials. We limited the analysis of the secondary
outcome number of ’sick days’ (days with restricted activities from the ARI within 14 days following randomisation) to the primary
care trials because other trials did not assess this outcome.
In addition, based on referee comments during the initial editorial process of the initial review (Schuetz 2012), we added further
sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness of our results. Specifically, we performed sensitivity analyses excluding trials with low
adherence to PCT algorithms (< 70%) or not reporting adherence. We also performed sensitivity analyses with respect to methodological
quality criteria (allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment). We further performed a sensitivity analysis excluding trials
with a follow-up time for mortality different than one month. We conducted meta-analyses with aggregated data of included trials
to further investigate heterogeneity (inconsistency measure I2 statistic and Cochran Q test) of intervention effects and trial subgroups
based on adherence to PCT algorithms.
