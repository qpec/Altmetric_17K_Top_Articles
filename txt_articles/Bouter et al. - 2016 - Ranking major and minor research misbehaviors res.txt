Abstract
Background: Codes of conduct mainly focus on research misconduct that takes the form of fabrication, falsification,
and plagiarism. However, at the aggregate level, lesser forms of research misbehavior may be more important due to
their much higher prevalence. Little is known about what the most frequent research misbehaviors are and what their
impact is if they occur.
Methods: A survey was conducted among 1353 attendees of international research integrity conferences. They were
asked to score 60 research misbehaviors according to their views on and perceptions of the frequency of occurrence,
preventability, impact on truth (validity), and impact on trust between scientists on 5-point scales. We expressed the
aggregate level impact as the product of frequency scores and truth, trust and preventability scores, respectively. We
ranked misbehaviors based on mean scores. Additionally, relevant demographic and professional background
information was collected from participants.
Results: Response was 17% of those who were sent the invitational email and 33% of those who opened it.
The rankings suggest that selective reporting, selective citing, and flaws in quality assurance and mentoring
are viewed as the major problems of modern research. The “deadly sins” of fabrication and falsification ranked
highest on the impact on truth but low to moderate on aggregate level impact on truth, due to their low
estimated frequency. Plagiarism is thought to be common but to have little impact on truth although it
ranked high on aggregate level impact on trust.
Conclusions: We designed a comprehensive list of 60 major and minor research misbehaviors. Our respondents were
much more concerned over sloppy science than about scientific fraud (FFP). In the fostering of responsible conduct of
research, we recommend to develop interventions that actively discourage the high ranking misbehaviors from
our study.

 Background
While responsible conduct of research is expected of sci-
entists [1–3], breaches of research integrity occur and
some of these may be alarmingly common. The princi-
ples are made explicit in many codes of conduct [4–8].
These codes typically are “aspirational” in the sense that
they focus on a description of the virtues and values
scientists ought to live up to [9, 10]. Codes of conduct
are often quite vague about the dos and don’ts and com-
monly do not try to make the norms of scientific re-
search explicit in operational terms by listing the specific
behaviors to adopt or to avoid.
In fact, there is a whole spectrum of minor and major re-
search misbehaviors. At the extreme end of the spectrum,
there are clear instances of research misconduct, like fabri-
cation, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP). These “major”
misbehaviors are clearly wrong and are typically committed
intentionally. Most codes of conduct equal breaches of re-
search integrity to committing research misconduct and
try to distinguish this from “minor offences,” usually called
questionable research practices (QRPs) or “sloppy science.”
QRPs thus occupy an important part of the continuum
with on one end research misconduct and on the other
end responsible conduct of research. QRPs often concern
trespasses of methodological principles that threaten the
relevance, validity, trustworthiness, or efficiency of the
study at issue [10] and may be committed intentionally or
unintentionally. In the latter case, scientists do not know
or do not agree that the behavior at issue is undesirable
and should be avoided. In short, research misconduct as
well as sloppy science threaten the validity of scientific
knowledge and may also inflict damage to the trust be-
tween scientists and, if revealed in the media, may also
damage public confidence in science.
The total harm caused by a specific research misbehav-
ior depends on the frequency of its occurrence and the
impact when it occurs. Furthermore, the impact is difficult
to assess empirically and may vary between instances. This
impact can consist of negative consequences for the valid-
ity of knowledge (“impact on truth”) and for the trust be-
tween scientists (“impact on trust”). Since the frequency
of occurrence of most QRPs is probably much higher than
the frequency of FFP, on the aggregate, QRPs may be
much more detrimental than FFP [11, 12]. A number of
surveys have focused on the self-reported prevalence of
major and minor research misbehaviors [13–15]. A meta-
analysis of 21 surveys concludes that 2% of the partici-
pants admit to have fabricated or falsified data at least
once during the last 3 years [16]. The self-reported 3-year
prevalence
of
questionable
research
practices
varied
widely across studies, with an unweighted mean of 34%.
These surveys all focus on specific research misbehaviors,
using partly overlapping but also different or differently
formulated items.
Most researchers, when asked to give examples of
breaches of research integrity will mention fabrication,
falsification, and plagiarism, whereas only few can mention
more than some QRP items. To date, there is no acknowl-
edged and comprehensive list of major and minor misbe-
haviors available, which makes it rather laborious for
educators and research leaders to acquire an adequate
overview. Furthermore, the many forms of research misbe-
havior have to our knowledge not been ranked. Our first
aim in this study is to present a comprehensive list of
misbehaviors, acknowledged by experts. Our second study
aim is to provide expert-based rankings of these specific
research misbehaviors according to their views on and per-
ceptions of the frequency of occurrence, preventability,
impact on truth (validity), impact on trust between scien-
tists, and combinations of these. We also will explore
whether rankings differ between disciplinary fields.
Methods
We drafted a list of major and minor research misbehav-
iors in five steps. Firstly, a comprehensive list of more
than 100 items and sub-items was compiled from the lit-
erature, codes of conduct, guidelines, and our own expe-
riences. This first list covered all the major and minor
deviations from responsible conduct of research we
could think of. Secondly, we shortened the list to 60
items by eliminating redundancies, merging items, re-
phrasing some of the items, and reformulating a number
of items to make them relevant for all empirical re-
search. Thirdly, this list was tried out by a group of 15
experienced researchers drafting a national research pro-
gram on fostering responsible research practices in the
Netherlands. In an interactive workshop, the items were
ranked and comments on the formulation and the rele-
vance of the items plus suggestions for items that also
should be included were made. This resulted in some
changes in the item list. Fourthly, we invited a selected
group
of

chairs
6 months before the 4th World Conference on Research
Integrity (4th WCRI), Rio de Janeiro, 2015. In a web-
based survey, they were asked to estimate frequency of
occurrence and impact on truth and trust of all items, to
suggest lacking items, and on the formulation of the
items. Fifthly, the 34 respondents were invited (26
attended) for a workshop at the 4th WCRI which re-
sulted in the list of items used in the project reported on
in this publication. Also, the study design and the for-
mulations of the survey questions and answer options
were based on the workshop.
The authors interactively reached consensus on the al-
location of the items to one of four topic domains: study
design (items that concern the phase before the start of
data collection), data collection (items that concern the
phase of data collection), reporting (items that concern

 data-analysis and reporting the results of the study), and
collaboration (items that concern obligations towards
colleagues and science as a whole).
For our survey, we excluded the experts who had been
involved in the formulation of the list of 60 items. Email
addresses of the 1353 (1345 after omitting clearly incorrect
email addresses) other participants of at least one of the
four past World Conferences of Research Integrity [17]
were randomly allocated to three groups [18]. Each partici-
pant received an email (see Additional file 1) with a link to
a questionnaire (see Additional file 2) containing the 20
items of research misbehavior for that group. For each
participant, we randomized the order of presentation of
the items. We included only 20 misbehavior items in each
questionnaire to avoid non-response due to an otherwise
excessive length. Participants were asked about frequency,
impact on truth, impact on trust, and preventability of
each item on a 1–5 point scale (see Additional file 2). Im-
pact on the aggregate level was operationalized by the
product of frequency scores and truth, trust and prevent-
ability scores, respectively. Additionally, relevant demo-
graphic and professional background information was
collected from all participants (see Additional file 2).
The invitational email (see Additional file 1) and subse-
quent reminders were sent in November and December
2015. The email included a link to the online question-
naire available on the website of SurveyMonkey [19] and
another link to opt out. After 2 and 4 weeks, a reminder
was sent to non-responders that had not opted out. Invi-
tees that opted out were asked to disclose their reasons
for declining participation and to provide basic back-
ground information. We emphasized that all questions
pertained to the views of the respondents on the general
situation in his or her disciplinary field and also that the
survey concerns their personal subjective opinions on the
items presented, that may have been formed by direct
experience, stories from colleagues, and/or knowledge of
the literature on research misbehavior (Additional file 3).
Data of the 60 items on frequency, impact on truth
and trust, and preventability were exported from Survey-
Monkey in SPSS format. Data were then read into
STATA 13.1 using StatTransfer (version 12-64). Simple
descriptive analyses were performed using STATA 13.1.
The ranking was based on the mean scores on fre-
quency, impact on truth, and impact on trust of the 60
items. The item means of the products of the scores for
frequency and for impact on truth, of frequency and im-
pact on trust, and of frequency and preventability were
also calculated, and the items were then ranked accord-
ingly using STATA 13.1.
Results
Response was 17% of those who were sent the invita-
tional email, 20% of the valid email addresses, 33% of
the emails opened, and 77% of the links to the survey
opened (see Table 1). Thirty-three invitees (5% of those
who opened the invitational e-mail) disclosed their
reasons for declining participation and provided basic
background information, 39% of them argued that they
were not involved in the area of research on research
misbehaviors as the main reason for non-participation,
while 24% reported no professional link to the area of
research integrity.
Thirty-five percent of the 227 respondents did not
provide data on the characteristics listed in Table 2.
Fifty-eight percent of the participants who did had a bio-
medical background and 19% came from the social sci-
ences. On average, the participants of the survey worked
in Academia for two decades or more, and the majority
came from Western Europe and North America.
Table 3 shows the top 5 of the 60 research misbehavior
items when ranked according to perceived frequency of
occurrence, assumed impact on truth and trust, the pu-
tative preventability, and the products of frequency and
impact on truth, trust, and preventability, respectively.
Additional file 4 shows the rankings for all 60 items, in-
cluding the ranking of the summary priority scores.
Additional file 5 shows all scores and the number of
respondents per item, plus the views on how these re-
search misbehaviors might be prevented.
Selective citing features twice in the frequency top 5.
Also insufficient supervision, not publishing a negative
study and honorary authorship are believed to be highly
prevalent. Our respondents agree that fabrication and
falsification are the largest threats to validity if they
occur. Furthermore, yielding to pressure by sponsors,
using an inadequate study design and concealing unwel-
come results are thought to compromise truth-finding.
The same items—in a slightly different order—feature in
the impact on trust top 5. The ranking of the five most
important preventable items contains mainly trespasses
of rules that could be maintained more strictly and that
concern safety risks, handling and storage of data and
(bio)materials, and quality assurance in general. Also,
plagiarism and reviewing one’s own papers are consid-
ered to be preventable.
Insufficient supervision and mentoring rank highest in
two of the aggregate rankings presented in Table 3, sug-
gesting that this item is not only very important but also

 preventable. Also, keeping inadequate notes of the re-
search process and ignoring basic principles of quality
assurance are in both these top 5’s, which makes them
additional
candidates
for
intervention. The ranking
based on the product of frequency and truth scores add-
itionally emphasizes the importance of insufficiently
reporting study flaws and limitations and of ignoring
breaches of research integrity made by others. The rank-
ing on the product of frequency and preventability
scores also suggest that inadequate handling and storage
of data and (bio)materials as well as plagiarism are
important candidates for preventive action. An item
concerning plagiarism is number one of the product
ranking of frequency and trust and number three of the
product ranking of frequency and preventability.
In Table 4, we summarize the data on the three forms
of research misconduct: fabrication, falsification, and
plagiarism. These items are ordered according to their
increasing (perceived) frequency. While fabrication and
falsification are believed to occur (very) infrequently, the
plagiarism items are perceived to be more common. The
impact on truth scores clearly shows that fabrication and
falsification are—when they occur—believed to be the
most severe validity threats by far. In summary, the
ranking based on the product of frequency and impact
on truth scores suggests that the “deadly sins” of
research integrity contained in Table 4 rank only low to
moderate and do not feature in the top 15.
In a secondary analysis, we looked at the differences
between disciplinary fields (see Additional file 6). For the
humanities, we had not enough respondents for a mean-
ingful comparison. It seems that in the biomedical sciences,
selective citation is perceived to be more common than in
the social sciences, and in the social sciences, reporting
misbehaviors are believed to be more frequent. The differ-
ences between the rankings for biomedical and natural
sciences appear to be small.
Discussion
The non-ranked list of 60 research misbehaviors (see
Additional file 3) has already been useful in our hands to
show young as well as senior researchers that there are
many possibilities to improve their research. Specifying
the don’ts for educational purposes is in line with Mazar
and Ariely’s recommendation to leave little room for
rationalizing dishonesty [20].
We identified the research behaviors that were per-
ceived to be major problems, by individuals who are
likely to be experts and who may have had direct experi-
ence with issues relating to research integrity. It remains
to be assessed how common these behaviors really are
and whether the rankings reflect their actual gravity. We
do not know what proportion of these conference partic-
ipants are actually “experts” in judging the ranking of
the behaviors about which our survey queried them. It is
interesting to note that more than a quarter (27%) of
our respondents reported their job title as “Other,”
which might be due to an overrepresentation of aca-
demic job titles among the answer options. Therefore,
we know little about the “credentials” of this group
pertinent to the survey questions.
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to rank a
comprehensive list of major and minor research misbehav-
iors that covers all disciplinary fields. However, a Delphi
survey among 40 experts identified types of scientific

 misconduct that would most likely bias the results and
conclusions of a clinical trial [21]. That study, too, did not
rank fabrication and falsification highly because the Delphi
panel—like our respondents—judged their frequency of oc-
currence to be very low. A substantial number of the
resulting list of 60 items was similar to ours. The list of 13
items that >50% of the Delphi panel thought to be likely or
very likely to occur contains multiple forms of selective
reporting and undisclosed data-driven statistical analyses.
The response (17%) was low, although some email ad-
dresses were invalid and only about half of the emails
were opened. We were disappointed that only 42% (293/
693) of those who opened the invitational email also
opened the survey. These 400 invitees based their deci-
sion not to participate in the survey exclusively on the
information contained in the invitational email (see
Additional file 1). Some, unknown, proportion of these
individuals may have decided that they lacked sufficient
knowledge, experience or expertise to answer the survey
questions adequately, in which case their decision not to
participate would be quite appropriate, and not seen as a
threat to the validity of the survey results.
Readers should bear in mind a number of other limita-
tions inherent to our approach. We collected data on
the personal views on the frequency and the impact of a
series of major and minor research misbehaviors of a
convenience sample consisting of participants of one or
more World Conferences on Research Integrity. These
views may be formed by direct experience, stories from
colleagues, or knowledge of the literature on research
misbehavior. We have no means to validate these views
with more objective evidence on the occurrence and im-
pact of the major and minor research misbehaviors we
studied. Furthermore, although we tried to formulate the
60 items and our survey questions and answer options
as unambiguously as possible, we do not know if the
respondents, with their wide range of disciplinary back-
grounds, had a common understanding of the issues
raised and were not unduly influenced by the way we
formulated the invitational email and the survey ques-
tions. Our numbers turned out to be too low to analyze
heterogeneity of rankings for, e.g., disciplinary fields,
geographical regions, and job titles. We cannot exclude
that these characteristics influenced the rankings, for
instance, when the many professors and the few PhD
students in our sample would have different opinions on
authorship. Another limitation is that our survey focused
on trust between scientists and did not study the impact
on trust in science in general. Finally, the interpretation
of 95% confidence interval (CI) in a convenience sample
with a low response rate is a bit problematic, although it
is not unusual to present the 95% CI as an indicator of
precision in situations other than inferences from a
random sample to the source population.

 A recent Cochrane review identified 31 studies on the
effects on research behavior and researchers’ attitudes of
educational and policy interventions [22] and made it
clear that there is hardly any convincing evidence for an
effect on research integrity or responsible conduct of
research. Most studies were found to be of (very) low
quality and many concerned training programs to avoid
plagiarism. Taken together, the authors of the review
conclude that the effects of educational and policy inter-
ventions are uncertain with a possible exception for
training about plagiarism that uses practical exercises
and text-matching software. Unfortunately, items con-
cerning plagiarism scored low to very low on truth-based
rankings in our survey.
The aggregate rankings in Table 3 place a great re-
sponsibility for prevention on supervisors and mentors.
We doubt that supervisors and mentors in general are
sufficiently aware of the wide spectrum of specific be-
haviors to be avoided our list stipulates (see Additional
file 3). We speculate that supervisors and mentors could
do a much better job if they used such a list systematic-
ally in training, supervision, and mentoring. We also be-
lieve that our list offers a clear and pragmatic view on
the origin of a multitude of everyday research dilemmas
because many of the don’ts can serve to unacceptable
polishing of research findings. Thus our list can serve as
a sobering “writing on the wall” for scientists who are
under the spell of perverse incentives to prioritize high
publication and citation rates for boosting their career,
rather than devote themselves to the production of valid
and trustworthy knowledge. Recently, Darwinian evolu-
tion theory was used to explain why sloppy science is a
winning strategy to survive in modern science [23], and
our findings also add to the current argumentation for
changing the selective forces and to make the incentives
of the science system less perverse by making the re-
ward criteria more diverse [24]. Finally, we would like to
emphasize that all attempts to fight sloppy science and
worse should ideally be accompanied by sound evalu-
ation to assess their effects [25, 26].
Conclusions
Our ranking results seem to suggest that selective
reporting, selective citing, and flaws in quality assurance
and mentoring are the major evils of modern research.
A picture emerges not of concern about wholesale fraud
but of profound concerns that many scientists may be
cutting corners and engage in sloppy science, possibly
with a view to get more positive and more spectacular
results that will be easier to publish in a high-impact
journal and will attract many citations. In the fostering
of responsible conduct of research, we recommend to
develop interventions that actively discourage the high-
ranking misbehaviors from our study.
