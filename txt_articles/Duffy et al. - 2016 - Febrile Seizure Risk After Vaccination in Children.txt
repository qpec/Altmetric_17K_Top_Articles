abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: An increased risk of febrile seizure (FS) was identified with 
concomitant administration of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) and 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 13-valent during the 2010–2011 influenza season. 
Our objective was to determine whether concomitant administration of IIV3 with other 
vaccines affects the FS risk.
METHODS: We examined the risk of FS 0 to 1 day postvaccination for all routinely 
recommended vaccines among children aged 6 through 23 months during a period 
encompassing 5 influenza seasons (2006–2007 through 2010–2011). We used a population-
based self-controlled risk interval analysis with a control interval of 14 to 20 days 
postvaccination. We used multivariable regression to control for receipt of concomitant 
vaccines and test for interaction between vaccines.
RESULTS: Only PCV 7-valent had an independent FS risk (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.98; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 3.91). IIV3 had no independent risk (IRR, 0.46; 95% CI, 
0.21 to 1.02), but risk was increased when IIV3 was given with either PCV (IRR, 3.50; 95% 
CI, 1.13 to 10.85) or a diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis (DTaP)-containing vaccine 
(IRR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.52 to 8.07). The maximum estimated absolute excess risk due to 
concomitant administration of IIV3, PCV, and DTaP-containing vaccines compared with 
administration on separate days was 30 FS per 100 000 persons vaccinated.
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of IIV3 on the same day as either PCV or a DTaP-containing 
vaccine was associated with a greater risk of FS than when IIV3 was given on a separate 
day. The absolute risk of postvaccination FS with these vaccine combinations was small.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Febrile seizures 
are mostly benign, but potentially alarming. Previous 
studies have found an increased risk of fever and 
febrile seizure on postvaccination days 0 and 1 when 
inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine and pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine were given on the same day.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Administration of an 
inactivated infl
 uenza vaccine and a diphtheria-
tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine on the same day 
was also associated with an increased risk of febrile 
seizure. The excess risk of giving these 3 vaccines 
together was 30 per 100 000 persons vaccinated.

Febrile seizures (FS) are seizures 
that occur in febrile children between 
the ages of 6 and 60 months who do 
not have an intracranial infection, 
metabolic disturbance, or history 
of afebrile seizures.1 About 5% 
of children experience a FS.2 FS 
can occur with various infections, 
including influenza.3, 
4 The risk of 
FS is also temporarily increased for 
several days after certain vaccines 
(diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, whole-
cell pertussis vaccine, measles, 
mumps, rubella vaccine [MMR], 
and MMR, varicella combination 
vaccine [MMRV]).5, 
6 Before 2010, 
no increased FS risk had been 
observed after trivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccine (IIV3).7, 
8 Then, an 
increased risk of FS was detected in 
Australia for the IIV3 manufactured 
by CSL Limited (Victoria, Australia), 
with most FS occurring within 12 
hours of vaccination.9 Subsequent 
vaccine safety monitoring in the 
United States during the 2010–2011 
influenza season also detected an 
increased risk of FS for the IIV3 
manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur.7 
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
13-valent (PCV13) had been 
introduced in the United States in 
2010, and it was hypothesized that 
concomitant vaccine administration 
might have played a role in the US 
findings.10 Additional epidemiologic 
investigation found an independent 
risk of FS in 2010–2011 with IIV3 
and also PCV13, and the greatest 
risk when both vaccines were given 
together.10 The effect of other vaccines 
was not evaluated in that study. Our 
objective was to determine whether 
other vaccines given concomitantly 
with IIV3 affected the risk of FS 
after vaccination in 2010–2011 or 
previous influenza seasons. This 
required examining the FS risk after 
the 10 vaccines recommend for all 
children in the United States.11
METHODS
The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) 
is a collaboration between the US 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and several integrated 
health care organizations (sites) 
in the United States that performs 
vaccine safety research and 
surveillance.12 Ten sites with a 
combined annual population of ∼9.8 
million members contributed data 
to this study. We identified VSD 
members aged 6 through 23 months 
who had an FS during prespecified 
time intervals after receipt of ≥1 
vaccines of any type. We focused on 
the 6–23-month age range because FS 
occur most commonly at these ages, 
and this is when most vaccine doses 
recommended for children ages 6 to 
60 months are given. FS was defined 
as a clinical diagnosis of seizure with 
a recorded temperature ≥38°C or 
caregiver-reported fever within 24 
hours, or a clinician’s diagnosis of FS, 
excluding patients with intracranial 
infection, metabolic disturbance, 
or a history of afebrile seizure. We 
defined the day of vaccination as 
day 0. We identified potential FS 
cases by emergency department 
visits or inpatient admissions coded 
with International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) 
diagnoses 780.3 through 780.39 
(convulsions) that occurred on 
postvaccination days 0 to 1 or 14 
to 20 from July 1, 2006 through 
June 30, 2011.13 We excluded visits 
that occurred ≤42 days after a 
previous visit with a convulsion 
ICD-9 code because those are less 
likely to represent a new event.10 
We abstracted medical records for 
all eligible visits at 9 sites and a 
random sample at 1 large site (due 
to abstraction capacity limitations) 
to confirm the FS diagnosis and time 
of onset and to obtain additional 
descriptive information.
We used the self-controlled risk 
interval method to compare the 
incidence of FS during the risk 
interval (0–1 days postvaccination) 
to the control interval (14–20 days 
postvaccination).10 The risk interval 
represents the biologically plausible 
time period during which inactivated 
vaccines can induce fever.14 The 
control interval represents a 
time period during which neither 
inactivated nor live-attenuated 
vaccines induce fever and the risk 
of FS is at baseline. Comparing 2 
different time intervals for the same 
individual inherently controls for 
factors that do not change over time. 
Choosing a control interval that is 
relatively short and close in time to 
the risk interval implicitly controls 
for factors that change over time, 
such as age and season.
We modeled the incidence rate ratio 
(IRR) of FS using conditional Poisson 
regression with an offset term to 
account for the different interval 
lengths. Separate dichotomous 
variables indicated whether each 
vaccine type was given on day 0 or 
not. Different vaccine products that 
have antigens in common (such 
as the various diphtheria-tetanus-
acellular-pertussis vaccine [DTaP]-
containing vaccines) were grouped 
into 1 variable for certain models. 
An influenza season was defined 
as July 1 of 1 year through June 
30 of the following year. We first 
examined the 2006–2007 through 
2009–2010 seasons, then replicated 
the analysis for the 2010–2011 
season, which was examined 
separately because an increased risk 
of FS had previously been observed 
only with the 2010–2011 IIV3, and 
PCV13 replaced PCV 7-valent (PCV7) 
in the United States during 2010. 
Findings were similar for the 2 time 
periods, so all study time was then 
pooled together. We selected a final 
multivariable model by starting 
with all vaccines in the model and 
performing a manual sequential 
elimination process, first removing 
vaccines with an IRR <1 and then 
in decreasing order of variance. 
Vaccines with an independent 
effect, IIV3, and any vaccines 
that affected the relationship of 
IIV3 with FS were retained in the 
model to examine effect–measure 
modification (interaction) involving

IIV3 using product terms, which 
were also retained if the likelihood 
ratio statistic P value was < .10. 
We calculated model-based 
estimates of the IRR for each unique 
combination of vaccines included 
in the final model and further 
assessed multiplicative and additive 
measures of interaction between 
these vaccines using the ratio of IRRs 
and the relative excess risk due to 
interaction (RERI), respectively.15 We 
calculated 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the ratio of IRRs based on 
the IRR SEs and for RERI using the 
bootstrap percentile interval method 
with 10 000 samples.16, 
17 We created 
additional models to obtain adjusted 
IRR estimates for the vaccines not 
found to interact with IIV3.
We estimated the attributable risk 
(AR) as: (IRR – 1) × (the baseline 
incidence rate of FS in the VSD 
population per person-day) × 
(2 person-days in the risk interval). 
The baseline incidence was 
determined using the ICD-9 code 
criteria described above regardless 
of previous vaccination and without 
chart confirmation during 2000 to 
2011.
Analysis was performed by using 
SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, 
NC). Institutional review boards at 
US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and each site approved 
this study and determined that 
informed consent was not required.
RESULTS
We identified 596 potential FS cases 
during the specified intervals (risk 
interval, n = 183; control interval, 
n = 413) after 1 915 108 vaccination 
events. We requested charts for 
468 of the potential cases, of which 
428 had records available. FS was 
chart confirmed in 348 cases (all 
unique individuals), from which 13 
were excluded because the seizure 
occurred outside of the specified 
intervals and 2 because vaccines 
were also given during the specified 
intervals after day 0, resulting in 333 
chart-confirmed FS cases for analysis.
Approximately half of the case-
patients had experienced a previous 
FS (Table 1). Patients whose FS 
occurred during the risk interval had 
received a greater median number 
of vaccines on day 0 than patients 
whose FS occurred during the control 
interval and were more likely to have 
received an antipyretic medication 
before the FS, although it is unknown 
whether this difference was due to 
prophylactic use or in response to 
fever. At the medical visit for the 
FS, an infection was documented in 
77% of control interval cases but 
only 37% of risk interval cases. The 
most common type in both groups 
was upper respiratory tract infection. 
Other infections included otitis 
media, viral infection not otherwise 
specified, urinary tract infections, and 
lower respiratory tract infections. 
The 333 case-patients had received 
129 unique vaccine combinations 
on day 0, with the most common 
being IIV3 alone (n = 45), hepatitis 
A (HepA) alone (n = 22), and DTaP + 
HepA (n = 14).
None of the IIV3 formulations for 
the 2006–2007 through 2009–2010 
influenza seasons were associated 
with FS (IRR < 1), so these were 
combined into a single variable for 
subsequent models. The influenza 
A(H1N1)2009 pandemic monovalent 
inactivated vaccine (2009 H1N1 MIV) 
also had an IRR < 1. The IRR for the 
2010–2011 IIV3 was 1.17 (95% CI, 
0.24 to 5.78) (Table 2).

Multivariable modeling identified 
potential interaction between IIV3, 
PCV, and DTaP-containing vaccines, 
therefore the final model included 
these 3 vaccines and their interaction 
terms. After adjusting for receipt of 
concomitant vaccines, only PCV7 
was associated with an independent 
increased risk of FS (IRR = 1.98, 
95% CI, 1.00 to 3.91). There was 
no independent increased risk with 
either IIV3 or DTaP-containing 
vaccines (Table 2).
Evaluating the risk of concomitant 
administration of IIV3, PCV, and 
DTaP-containing vaccines revealed 
the risk of FS was increased when 
IIV3 was given with either PCV 
or a DTaP-containing vaccine or 
when all 3 were given together 
(Table 3). The RERI between IIV3 
and DTaP-containing vaccines was 
statistically significant and greater 
than the interaction between IIV3 
and PCV, which was increased but 
not statistically significant (Table 
4). The AR estimates vary with age 
because the baseline FS incidence 
changes with age, so we show the 
AR estimates for 3 ages at which 
vaccines are recommended (Table 5). 
Subtracting the estimated AR for each 
vaccine from the AR for all 3 given 
together at age 15 months revealed 
that the maximum absolute excess 
risk of FS due to administration of 
these 3 vaccines together compared 
with receiving all 3 vaccines on 
separate days was 30 per 100 000 
persons vaccinated. Compared with 
administration on separate days, the 
excess risk of receiving IIV3 with a 
DTaP-containing vaccine was 24 per 
100 000 persons vaccinated and was 
16 per 100 000 persons vaccinated 
for IIV3 with PCV. The absolute 
excess risk due to interaction is 
illustrated in Fig 1.
DISCUSSION
Among children aged 6 through 
23 months who had a FS after 
vaccination, we found an increased 
risk of FS when IIV3 was given at 
the same time as either PCV or a 
DTaP-containing vaccine, but no 
increased risk of FS when IIV3 was 
given alone. Influenza vaccine has 
been recommended for all children 
ages 6 to 23 months since the 
2004–2005 influenza season.18 IIV3 
includes 3 different influenza virus 
strains, which may be changed each 
year to match influenza viruses 
expected in the upcoming season. 
During the 5 influenza seasons we 
studied, at least 1 of the 3 strains was 
changed each year. The 2010–2011 
season formulation (the last year 
included in our study) was used 
again in the 2011–2012 season, 
and epidemiologic vaccine safety 
surveillance detected an increased 
risk of FS in both seasons.10, 
19 The 
IIV3 formulation was changed for 
the 2012–2013 season, and no 
increased risk of FS was observed 
in that season.19 In our study, IIV3 
in the seasons before the 2010–
2011 season appeared to have a 
protective effect against FS in the 
0 to 1 days postvaccination. A true 
protective effect during this time 
period does not seem biologically

Because some vaccines are not given together at the same visit (eg, DTaP and DTaP-HepB-IPV) or were not used during 
the same time period (eg, PCV7 and PCV13), different subgroups and regression models were used to obtain the adjusted

plausible because it takes about 2 
weeks for antibodies to develop 
postvaccination. This finding is likely 
due to the “healthy vaccinee effect, 
” 
in which the incidence of adverse 
events in the first few days after 
vaccination is less than the baseline 
incidence, because vaccination may 
be deferred for children who are 
acutely ill.20, 
21 For the 2010–2011 
IIV3 formulation, we observed an 
IRR >1, which was not statistically 
significant but suggests a higher 
risk of FS than the previous seasons. 
Studies conducted by CSL Limited 
using in vitro assays showed that 
the combination of the influenza 
B and A/H1N1 strains included in 
the 2010–2011 vaccine formulation 
elicited greater bioactivity than the 
strain combinations used in seasons

c n equals the sum of FS cases in the risk and control intervals who received the vaccine or combination of vaccines listed in each row.
d IRR was calculated using the fi

IIV3*PCV*DTaP-containing (PCV represents PCV7, PCV13, or either depending on the time period).
e PCV7 was evaluated during the 2006–2007 to 2009–2010 time period because it was the PCV product in use for the vast majority of this period; PCV13 was evaluated during the 2010–2011 
time period.

going back to the 2005–2006 season, 
although it is unknown if this would 
also apply to the Sanofi Pasteur 
vaccines used in the United 
States.22, 
23
Our results indicate that PCV7 
increases the risk of FS in the 2 days 
postvaccination by itself regardless 
of concomitant vaccination. During 
our study period, there were fewer 
doses of PCV13 given than PCV7, 
and our adjusted risk estimate for 
PCV13 had wide CIs, but our results 
do not suggest a difference in FS 
risk between PCV13 and PCV7. A 
previous study found no difference 
in FS risk for PCV13 compared 
with PCV7 in the 0 to 7 days 
postvaccination.24
Concerns about adverse events, 
including FS, with whole-cell 
pertussis vaccines prompted 
the development of the acellular 
pertussis vaccines currently used 
in the United States.25 In our study, 
the FS case-patients received 5 
different DTaP-containing products. 
Most common were the DTaP-only 
products (64%), of which 83% 
were Infanrix (GlaxoSmithKline, 
Philadelphia, PA). The DTaP 
hepatitis b, inactivated poliovirus 
combination vaccine (DTaP-HepB-
IPV; Pediarix, GlaxoSmithKline) 
was more common than the DTaP-
IPV, Haemophilus influenza type b 
combination vaccine (DTaP-IPV/
Hib; Pentacel, Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, 
France). Comparing the risk of 
FS between the different types of 
DTaP-containing vaccines was not 
a primary aim of this study. The 
point estimate for DTaP-HepB-
IPV was somewhat greater than 
for the other DTaP-containing 
products, but was not statistically 
significantly different. In clinical 
trials, DTaP-HepB-IPV had higher 
rates of fever compared with its 
separately administered component 
vaccines whereas DTaP-IPV/Hib did 
not.26, 
27 Because the various DTaP-
containing vaccines are not given 
together, we categorized them as a 
single variable in our primary 
model for the purposes of testing 
effect-measure modification 
between vaccines given at the 
same time.
After controlling for the receipt of 
concomitant vaccines, we did not 
observe an independent risk of FS in 
the 0 to 1 days postvaccination for 
any vaccines other than PCV. 
The 0- to 1-day risk interval is 
likely only biologically plausible 
for inactivated vaccines (ie, IIV3, 
PCV, DTaP, HepA, HepB, Hib, IPV, 
and 2009 H1N1 MIV were assessed 
in this study). We also examined 
the risk in the 0- to 1-day interval 
for live vaccines for the sake of 
completeness. As expected, we 
observed no independent risk 
with rotavirus vaccine pentavalent, 
MMR, varicella vaccine (VAR), or 
MMRV. A previous study examined 
MMRV, MMR, and VAR using an 
appropriate 7- to 10-day risk 
interval.6 We did not have any 
FS cases who received either 
rotavirus vaccine monovalent or 
live attenuated influenza vaccine 
because neither is recommended 
in the 6- to 23-month-old age 
group.
Our main question was whether the 
risk of FS after IIV3 given at the same 
time as other vaccines was greater 
than the risk after administration 
of IIV3 and the other vaccines on 
separate days. We found that the 
concomitant administration of IIV3 
with a DTaP-containing vaccine was 
associated with a risk of FS that was 
statistically significantly greater than 
the sum of the independent risks 
of each vaccine given separately. 
The relative excess risk due to the 
interaction between IIV3 and PCV 
was similarly elevated but not 
statistically significant, perhaps due 
to the smaller sample size for this 
combination. The clinical significance 
of the IIV3–PCV interaction is, 
however, supported by a study 
of fever incidence after IIV3 and 
PCV13 during the 2011–2012 
influenza season that revealed a 
synergistic effect with concomitant 
administration of those 2 vaccines.28 
Elucidating the biologic mechanism 
of these synergistic responses is a 
potential area for additional research. 
In our study, the concomitant 
administration of IIV3, PCV, and 
a DTaP-containing vaccine was 
associated with the greatest relative 
risk estimate, corresponding to an 
excess risk of 30 FS cases per 100 000 
persons vaccinated compared with 
the administration of each vaccine 
on a separate day. This is similar to 
the AR of FS previously identified for 
the MMR vaccine of 25 to 34 FS per 
100 000 persons vaccinated.5 This 
absolute risk may be outweighed by 
the benefits of timely vaccination that 
can be achieved by giving IIV3 on 
the same day as other vaccines when 
needed. We did not observe an excess 
risk when PCV and DTaP were given

c The IRR for the combination of PCV + DTaP was not statistically signifi

together without IIV3. The Advisory 
Committee on Immunization 
Practices does not recommend 
separating any of these vaccines to 
different days.29
Approximately 30% of children who 
have 1 FS will have more, and several 
risk factors for recurrence have been 
identified.30 Evidence is lacking for 
potential strategies to reduce the risk 
of FS. Giving prophylactic antipyretics 
before or at the time of vaccination 
is not recommended.31 Antipyretics 
given after a fever started did not 
prevent recurrent FS in a clinical 
trial.32 Oral diazepam given at 
the onset of febrile illness may be 
effective in preventing recurrent FS, 
but is not recommended because of 
the medication’s potential adverse 
effects.1
There are several challenges to 
studying the risk of concomitant 
vaccination using observational data. 
In practice, most childhood vaccines 
are administered concomitantly with 
other vaccines. There are 10 types 
of vaccines routinely recommended 
for all children between the ages of 6 
and 23 months in the United States. 
When different formulations of the 
same product that change over time 
(eg, PCV13 vs PCV7, or IIV3 for each 
influenza season) are considered, 
the resulting number of unique 
combinations is large compared with 
the small number of FS cases that 
occur after vaccination. This means 
that every unique combination 
cannot be studied separately and 
all possible vaccine interactions 
cannot be examined at once. The 
original concern about an increased 
risk of FS with concomitant IIV3 and 
PCV13 vaccination was identified 
in a single influenza season. By 
pooling data from 5 seasons, we 
had a larger sample size, which 
enabled us to examine 2-way and 
3-way interactions between IIV3 
and other vaccines. Despite our 
large source population, we did not 
have enough FS cases to support 
regression models with more than 
3-way interaction terms. The aim 
of this study was to assess the risk 
of concomitant administration 
of IIV3 with other vaccines, and

The individual blocks within each column indicate the estimated portion of the total risk that would be expected to be contributed by each individual 
vaccine (eg, PCV) or the excess risk contributed by the interaction between ≥2 vaccines (as indicated by a * [eg, IIV3*DTaP]). The AR for IIV3 or DTaP given 
alone is each 0. In this fi
 gure, the notation “DTaP” refers to any of the different types of DTaP-containing vaccines; “PCV” refers to either PCV7 or PCV13.

our multivariable model building 
approach focused on vaccine 
combinations that included IIV3. 
We therefore cannot rule out the 
possibility that vaccine combinations 
other than those described above 
might also be associated with an 
increased risk of FS. We were not 
able to examine other risk windows 
in this study because we prespecified 
the 0- to 1-day interval and only 
reviewed charts for those cases; 
however, based on previous studies 
of postvaccination fever and FS, this 
is the most appropriate interval to 
examine for inactivated vaccines.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that the risk 
of FS is increased after certain 
combinations of vaccines, but the 
absolute risk of FS after these 
combinations is small. The risk of 
FS must be weighed against the 
benefits of timely vaccination as 
recommended. IIV3, PCV, and DTaP 
vaccines each have the potential to 
prevent multiple episodes of infection, 
including fevers and FS caused 
by those infections. The potential 
benefit of vaccination to prevent FS 
over longer periods is less readily 
apparent than the short-term risk of 
FS in the first few days immediately 
after vaccination. Over the long-term, 
vaccination might reduce the risk of 
FS, though additional study would be 
needed to quantify this for each type 
of vaccine. Additional research will 
be needed to identify evidence-based 
strategies to mitigate the short-term 
risk of FS postvaccination among 
individuals at high risk of FS.
