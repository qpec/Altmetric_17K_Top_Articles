Abstract
Th2 immunity and allergic immune surveillance play critical roles in host
responses to pathogens, parasites and allergens. Numerous studies have reported
significant links between Th2 responses and cancer, including insights into the
functions of IgE antibodies and associated effector cells in both antitumour
immune surveillance and therapy. The interdisciplinary field of AllergoOncology
was given Task Force status by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology in 2014. Affiliated expert groups focus on the interface between
allergic responses and cancer, applied to immune surveillance, immunomodula-
tion and the functions of IgE-mediated immune responses against cancer, to
derive novel insights into more effective treatments. Coincident with rapid expan-
sion in clinical application of cancer immunotherapies, here we review the current
state-of-the-art and future translational opportunities, as well as challenges in this
relatively new field. Recent developments include improved understanding of Th2

antibodies, intratumoral innate allergy effector cells and mediators, IgE-mediated
tumour antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells, as well as immunotherapeu-
tic strategies such as vaccines and recombinant antibodies, and finally, the man-
agement of allergy in daily clinical oncology. Shedding light on the crosstalk
between allergic response and cancer is paving the way for new avenues of treat-
ment.
It has been recognized that tumours manipulate immune
responses. On the other hand, the overall immune compe-
tence of the host could critically determine immune surveil-
lance against cancer and the clinical course. Allergy and
atopy are characterized by a systemic bias to Th2 immunity,
which may exert a potential influence on cancer development.
In fact, allergy and oncology may represent two opposite
concepts: whereas immune tolerance is desired in allergy, it is
detrimental in cancer. Hence, the establishment of a Task
Force on AllergoOncology (AO) within the Immunology Sec-
tion of EAACI is timely and appropriate. The aim of the
Task Force is to connect basic scientists interested in Th2
immunity and cancer with clinical oncologists and to support
an interdisciplinary exchange to advance knowledge and
understanding of immune responses in both fields. At pre-
sent, this is the first AO platform worldwide.
Previous AO activities have included a first concerted
paper (1), international conferences, the book ‘IgE and Can-
cer’ (2) and a Symposium-in-Writing on AO (3).
A Pre-Task Force Meeting was held at the EAACI annual
conference in Copenhagen in 2014, leading to the establish-
ment of the Task Force within the Interest Group of
Immunology, with its first business meeting in Barcelona in
2015. The primary objectives of the Task Force were con-
firmed: to serve as an interface between the disciplines of
oncology and allergy, covering: (i) basic, (ii) translational,
(iii)
epidemiological
and (iv)
clinical
research,
including
allergy problems in clinical oncology, as well as (v) mecha-
nisms of tumour-induced immune modulation and (vi) novel
vaccination and immunotherapy approaches harnessing IgE
functions to target cancer.
The goal of this position paper was to provide an update
on developments in the AO field since 2008 (1). We therefore
aimed to review (i) clinical, mechanistic and epidemiological
insights into Th2 immune responses in cancer, (ii) current
immunological markers with a complementary role in allergy
and cancer, (iii) correlation of these markers with the pro-
gress of malignant diseases and (iv) an update on how oncol-
ogists can manage allergic reactions to cancer therapeutics.
The different topics were drafted by subgroups of the Task
Force and further discussed, developed and compiled during
a meeting in Vienna in 2015. The position paper was there-
after recirculated and critically appraised, and the final
version was approved by all Task Force members.
Epidemiology
The epidemiologic association between allergy and cancer
risk has been summarized in meta-analyses, with inverse
associations reported for several cancers including glioma,
pancreatic cancer, and childhood leukaemia (4, 5). The
majority of previous studies have relied on self-reported
ascertainment of allergic status, being typically limited, retro-
spective, and associated with potential biases. Emerging evi-
dence comes from prospective studies based on self-reported
allergy history which have reported inverse associations in
studies of colorectal (6), but not haematopoietic or prostate
cancer (7, 8). A large-scale study based on hospital discharge
records reported an inverse association between allergy/atopy
of at least 10 years in duration and incidence of brain cancer
[RR (Relative Risk) = 0.6, 95% CI (Confidence Interval)
0.4–0.9] in a cohort of 4.5 million men (9). Nested case–con-
trol studies reported inverse associations between borderline
or elevated total IgE (10) or respiratory-specific IgE and
glioma risk (10, 11). Serum total and allergen-specific IgE
provided evidence of inverse associations with the develop-
ment of melanoma, female breast cancer, gynaecological
malignancies and also glioma (12). Findings at other cancer
sites are unclear (13–15). One study reported an inverse trend
between increasing blood eosinophil count and subsequent
colorectal cancer risk (16). Another study reported that
serum concentrations of soluble CD23/FceRII (sCD23) and
soluble CD30 (sCD30) were positively associated with risk of
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (17). Several studies have exam-
ined associations with SNPs in allergy-related genes with sig-
nificant
associations
between
SNPs
in
FCER1A,
IL10,
ADAM33, NOS1 and IL4R genes and glioma risk reported
in one recent study which requires further replication (18).

biomarkers of allergy is needed, including repeated evalua-
tions

 developing tumour, and detailed data on potentially con-
founding variables (19).
Th2-associated antibodies in cancer
Although studied for decades, our understanding of different
immunoglobulin classes in cancer biology is still limited. IgG
antibodies are the predominant antibody class for passive
immunotherapy. Recent findings elucidated that the tumour
microenvironment
may
specifically
promote
less
potent
immunoglobulin isotypes such as IgG4 (20). Furthermore,
IgG and IgE free light chains engaging mast cells could
reduce tumour development in vivo (21). Furthermore, by
promoting specific phenotypes of tumour infiltrating leuco-
cytes and through inducing a higher expression of inhibitory
Fcc receptors, malignant cells can evade humoral immune
responses and counteract the antitumour effector functions
of therapeutic IgG antibodies (22).
A preliminary study has reported that both IgE and
IgG4 specific towards two of three cancer antigens are ele-
vated in patients with cancer compared with healthy volun-
teers (23). The phenomenon that anticancer therapies, such
as alkylating agents and hormone-based chemotherapies,
affect circulating total and specific IgE levels has also been
reported (24); however, any implications on clinical course
require further investigations. A number of these studies
also provide evidence in support of Th2 humoral immunity
to derive new tools for malignant disease monitoring and
prognosis.
Interestingly,
IgE
antibodies
isolated
from
patients with pancreatic cancer mediate antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against cancer cells (25).
Furthermore, higher levels of polyclonal IgE in nonallergic
individuals are directly correlated with lower disease inci-
dence and higher survival in multiple myeloma in a clinical
study (26). Collectively, these studies point to important
roles for Th2-associated antibodies and tumour immune
surveillance.
In situ expression of AID and potential insights into
antibody isotype expression in cancer
The enzyme cytidine deaminase (AID) which is responsible
for converting cytidine to uracil and thereby induces targeted
damage to DNA, is a key driver of immunoglobulin (Ig)
somatic hypermutation events and class switch recombination
processes that give rise to IgG, IgA or IgE. On the other
hand, AID has multifaceted functions linking immunity,
inflammation and cancer (27).
AID is thought to be expressed predominantly by germinal
centre (GC) B cells within secondary lymphoid organs. How-
ever, studies on local autoimmunity, transplant rejection, and
tissues exposed to chronic inflammation point to the capacity
of B lymphocytes to form GC-like ectopic structures outside
of secondary lymphoid tissues (27, 28), which is now also
demonstrated within benign and malignant tissues. Class
switching of local GC-derived B cells to different isotypes
may have a profound influence on local immune responses
and on disease pathobiology. However, whether tumour
microenvironments support direct class switching to IgE
remains unclear, although some evidence from animal models
points to IgE production at early stages of carcinogenesis
(29).
Remarkably,
local
follicle-driven
B
cell-attributed
immune responses may be either positively or negatively
associated with clinical outcomes of patients with cancer
(30, 31).
IgE receptor expression on immune cells and epithelial
cells
The high-affinity receptor FceRI tetrameric form abc2 is
expressed on mast cells and basophils. The trimeric form of
the high-affinity receptor FceRI (ac2) and the low-affinity
receptor CD23/FceRII (b form) (Fig. 1A) is expressed on
human monocytes and macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs),
eosinophils, platelets and neutrophils (32). The ‘a’ form of
CD23/FceRII is also expressed by subsets of B cells (33). IgE
cell surface receptors FceRI, FceRII/CD23 (Fig. 1A) and
also the soluble IgE receptors galectin-3 and galectin-9 are
expressed not only by haematopoietic cells, but also by non-
haematopoietic cells including epithelia (Table 1).
Depending on the nature and distribution of IgE receptors,
different functions might be envisaged. Galectin-3 is well recog-
nized for its contribution to tumour progression and metastasis
development (34), while galectin-9 seems to have antiprolifera-
tive effects (35, 36). The trimeric FceRI(ac2) showed membra-
nous and cytoplasmic expression in intestinal epithelial cells and
a prominent FceRI a-chain expression was also found in the
Paneth cells of patients with cancer of the proximal colon. In
the same study, a similar distribution could be observed in tis-
sues from patients with gastrointestinal inflammation, whereas
no expression was observed in healthy controls (37).
It is important to note that cell surface-expressed IgE-bind-
ing structures may have different effector functions compared
with their secreted forms such as soluble FceRIa chain (38)
and galectin-3 (39) in cancer, which may be of key functional
importance.
Effector cells in allergy and cancer
Mast cells
Mast cells are perhaps the most classical effector cells of IgE
(Fig. 1B). Their presence at the periphery, but also infiltrat-
ing tumours, argues for a role in tumour biology (40). The
presence of mast cells in many tumours has been associated
with poor prognosis (41), and it has been suggested that they
may contribute to an immunosuppressive tumour microenvi-
ronment and thereby impede protective antitumour immu-
nity. In addition, mast cells may promote tumour growth by
inducing angiogenesis and tissue remodelling through the
induction of changes in composition of the extracellular
matrix (42). In contrast, in colorectal cancers, mesothelioma,
breast cancer, large B-cell lymphoma, and in non-small-cell
lung cancer, high mast cell density has been associated with
favourable prognoses (43, 44). The observation of degranu-
lating mast cells near dying tumour cells has suggested a

 cytotoxic effect and their presence in invasive breast carcino-
mas correlate with better prognosis (45). In prostate cancer,
peri-tumoral
mast
cells

shown
to
promote,
while
intratumoral mast cells may restrict angiogenesis and tumour
growth (46). This apparent dichotomy in mast cell functions
in cancer may be explained by (i) tumour type, (ii) tumour
Figure 1 Cell surface IgE receptors and IgE-mediated direct and
indirect effects. (A) Cartoon of IgE binding to its cell surface recep-
tors. IgE binds to tetrameric (abc2) (left) and trimeric forms (ac2)
(middle) of FceRI through the extracellular domain of the alpha (a)
chain of the receptor. The low-affinity receptor CD23 trimer binds
IgE through recognition of the lectin domain (right). (B) Direct and
cell-mediated effects of antitumour IgE. Like IgG antibody thera-
pies, IgE targeting tumour antigens can exert direct effects through
recognizing the target antigen, such as interference with signalling,
resulting in growth inhibition. IgE can also bind via IgE receptors
(FceRI or FceRII/CD23) to a specific repertoire of effector cells (illus-
trated in the bottom panel). These interactions may lead to effector
functions against tumour cells, such as antibody-dependent cell-
mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) or cytotoxicity (ADCC), or mediator
release. Cross-linking of IgE is required for effector cell activation,
whereas soluble tumour antigens expressing only a single epitope
do not trigger IgE cross-linking on the surface of effector cells.

 stage, (iii) mast cell phenotypic plasticity and (iv) location of
mast cells in relation to tumour cells.
A wealth of evidence from human cancers and mouse
models of cancer indicates that mast cells via the action
of histamine on H1, H2 and H4 receptors contribute to
tumour invasion and angiogenesis (44). Mast cells may
also suppress the development of protective antitumour
immune responses by promoting regulatory T cell (Treg)--
mediated
suppression
in
the
tumour
microenvironment
(47).
Mast cells are attracted to the tumour microenvironment
by stem cell factor (SCF) secreted by tumour cells, and
secrete pro-angiogenic factors as well as matrix metallopro-
teinases (MMPs), which promote tumour vascularization and
invasiveness. Stem cell factor is the ligand for CD117 (c-kit
receptor), highly expressed by mast cells. SCF is essential in
mast
cell
recruitment,
tumour-associated
inflammation,
remodelling and immunosuppression (48). Stem cell factor-
stimulated
mast
cells
produce
matrix
metalloprotease-9
(MMP-9) that facilitates recruitment of mast cells and other
cells to the tumour. MMP-9 also augments tumour-derived
SCF production in an amplification feedback loop. Using
mast cell-deficient (C57BL/6-KitW-sh/W-sh) mice, it was shown
that mast cells (and mast cell-derived MMP-9) are necessary
and sufficient to promote growth of subcutaneously engrafted
prostate adenocarcinoma cells (49). Furthermore, mast cell
tumour-promoting potential is augmented through costimula-
tion with tumour-derived SCF and Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4) ligand, inhibiting mast cell degranulation, but trig-
gering their production and secretion of vascular endothelial
growth
factor
(VEGF)
and
interleukin-10
(IL-10).
In
contrast, mast cell stimulation by TLR4 ligand alone induces
IL-12, important regulator of T- and NK-cell responses (50).
Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and VEGF derived
from mast cells trigger intense angiogenic responses in vivo
(46). Infiltration of mast cells and activation of MMP-9 par-
allel the angiogenic switch in premalignant lesions and,
accordingly, accumulation of mast cells is usually found in

 the proximity of CD31+ cells and microvessels (51). Mast
cells are a major source of interleukin-17 (IL-17) which
enhances microvessel formation, being negatively prognostic
in gastric cancer (52). Mast cells may also contribute to an
immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment as they mobi-
lize
the
infiltration
of
myeloid-derived
suppressor
cells
(MDSCs) into tumours and induce the production of IL-17
by MDSCs (47), which indirectly attracts Tregs, enhancing
their suppressor function and IL-9 production; in turn, IL-9
strengthens the survival and pro-tumour effect of intratu-
moral mast cells.
There is some evidence, however, that these pro-tumoral
activities of mast cells may be subverted by targeting these
cells to promote tumour destruction. In a mouse allograft
model, triggering of degranulation of mast cells by IgE anti-
body cross-linking of cell surface FceRI resulted in Treg cell
impairment and acute CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated tis-
sue destruction (53). In addition, human mast cells have been
demonstrated to directly induce lymphoma tumour cell death
in vitro when incubated with an anti-CD20 IgE antibody
(54). These insights suggest the potential to reactivate these
cells against cancer through immunotherapies.
Eosinophils
Blood and tissue eosinophilia are prominent features of
allergy and also found to be associated with various cancers.
Tumour-associated eosinophilia (TATE) has been reported to
correlate with good or with bad prognosis. Epidemiological
and clinical studies suggest evidence of intratumoral eosino-
phil degranulation and tumoricidal activity (55) (Fig. 1B).
Human eosinophils have been reported to induce colon can-
cer cell death in vitro, implying mechanisms involving innate
receptors (TCRcd/CD3 complex, TLR2) and mediators such
as alpha-defensins, TNF-a, granzyme A and IL-18 (56–58).
Tumoricidal functions of eosinophils were target antigen-spe-
cific and differed among individuals. Additionally, tumour
antigen-specific IgE has been shown to trigger eosinophil-
mediated tumour cell death by cytotoxic mechanisms (59).
Importantly, eosinophils from allergic donors proved more
cytotoxic (56), which suggests that the allergic state favours
antitumour processes.
Macrophages
Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) differentiate from
monocyte precursors circulating in blood (Fig. 1B) and are
recruited to tumour sites by several pro-inflammatory mole-
cules such as chemokines (C-C motif chemokine ligand)
CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and also VEGF, transforming
growth
factor-b
(TGF-b)
and
colony-stimulating
factors
(GM-CSF and M-CSF) (60). Even if their phenotype is
under the control of specific tumour-derived chemokines and
cytokines that polarize macrophages to a pro-immune ‘M1’
or immunosuppressive/pro-angiogenic ‘M2’ phenotype, their
transcriptional profiles are distinct from regular M1 or M2
macrophages (61). Tumour-associated macrophages are char-
acterized by high expression of CCL2, CCL5, and IL-10 and
by
MGL1,
dectin-1,
CD81,
VEGF-A,
CD163,
CD68,
CD206, arginase-1 (Arg-1), nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2),
MHC-II and scavenger receptor A (62). Tumour-associated
macrophages may differ considerably in terms of function
and M1/M2 phenotype, depending on the type of tumour,
stage of progression and location within the tumour tissue
(60, 63); The M1/M2 TAM heterogeneity could explain the
poor prognosis in glioma and breast cancers and better
prognosis in stomach and colon, prostate and non-small-
cell
lung
cancers
(60).
Tumour-associated
macrophage
heterogeneity depends on the localization in the tumour
microenvironment:
In
normoxic
areas,
TAMs
show
a
CD206lowMHCIIhi
M1-like
phenotype;
in
hypoxic
areas
TAMs show a CD206hiMHCIIlow M2-like phenotype (61,
63). The expression of Arg-1 as well as VEGF-A, Solute
Carrier Family 2 members 1 and 3 (SCL2A1 and SCL2A3)
and NOS2 are specifically modulated in hypoxic area in
CD206hiMHCIIlow TAMs (63). Innovative drugs allow the
positive effects of elevating M1/kill and other anticancer
innate
responses
but
they
also
increase
an
undesired,
‘overzealous M1/kill–Th1 cytotoxic response’ contributing to
chronic inflammation (64).
New strategies aim to re-educate TAMs to exert antitu-
mour functions. In fact, even in a Th2-M2 tumour microen-
vironment macrophages stimulated by IL-4 and IL-13 were
able to inhibit proliferation of B16-F1 melanoma cells (65).
Moreover, macrophages may via IgE and IgG binding to
diverse
receptors
on
them
acquire
anti-tumour-killing
potency.
Tumour-associated
macrophages
express
these
receptors as well, enabling therapeutic monoclonal antibodies
to engage in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity/
phagocytosis (ADCC/ADCP) (66). Recent discoveries show
IgG4-positive cells in several tumour environments, possibly
being
attracted
by
CCL1–CCR8
interactions.
The
only
macrophage subtype producing CCL1 is M2b which support
vascularization and promote Th2-biased tumour microenvi-
ronments (67). More research on IgG/IgE effector functions
by TAMs is necessary to define new therapeutic concepts.
Dendritic cells
Antigen cross-presentation by DCs is key feature of antitu-
mour immunity as it results in the generation of cytotoxic
CD8+
T
lymphocytes
(CTLs)
against
tumour
antigens.
Recently, an IgE-mediated cross-presentation pathway has
been discovered (68, 69) (Fig. 2), resulting in priming of CTLs
to soluble antigen at unusually low dose, and independent
MyD88 signals or IL-12 production by DCs. Passive immu-
nization experiments and DC-based vaccination strategies con-
firmed
that
IgE-mediated
cross-presentation
significantly
improves antitumour immunity and even induces memory
responses in vivo. However, IL-4, a signature Th2 cytokine,
efficiently blunted IgE-mediated cross-presentation indicative
for a feedback mechanism that prevents overshooting CTL
responses during allergy (70). Deciphering details of IgE/
FceRI-mediated cross-presentation will further provide new
insights into the role of Th2 immune responses in tumour
defence and improve DC-based vaccination strategies.

 T lymphocytes
CD8+ T lymphocytes and Th1 cells play the central role in
elimination of tumour cells by the immune system (Fig. 2).
Th1 cells produce interferon-gamma (IFN-c) which mediates
antitumour activity by several mechanisms, including activa-
tion of macrophages, enhancement of antigen processing and
presentation, and inhibition of angiogenesis (71). The role of
Th2 cells in cancer is more controversial. In some cancers,
including breast (72), gastric (73) and pancreatic cancer (74,
75), Th2 cells and associated cytokines [IL-4, IL-13, Thymic
stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)] contribute to tumour pro-
gression. In addition, IL-4 plays a crucial role in the survival
of colon cancer stem cells (76). Therefore, IL-4 and IL-13
receptors are promising anticancer targets (77). On the other
hand, Th2 cells and cytokines can also play protective roles
against cancer. In Hodgkin lymphoma, high numbers of Th2
cells are associated with better survival (78). Thymic stromal
lymphopoietin has been shown to block early breast carcino-
genesis through the induction of Th2 cells (79). Thymic stro-
mal lymphopoietin can inhibit colon cancer by inducing
apoptosis of cancer cells (80). Thymic stromal lymphopoietin
and Th2 cells also mediate resistance to carcinogenesis in
mice with epidermal barrier defect (81, 82).
Further, DCs pulsed with anti-prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) IgE or with anti-HER2/neu IgE antibody, complexed
with antigen, induced enhanced CD4 and CD8 T-cell activa-
tion in vitro compared to antigen-complexed IgG1 (83, 84).
Similar observations were made upon OVA-specific IgE/
FceRI-mediated cross-priming in DC and T-cell cocultures,
where CD8 T-cell proliferation and granzyme B secretion
were
increased
(69).
Collectively,
these
findings
support
potential roles for Th2 responses in IgE immune surveillance
against cancer.
Translational strategies to target cancer
Tumour vaccines and adjuvants
Different approaches to induce IgE-mediated adaptive immu-
nity against cancer have been designed.
A cellular vaccine based on tumour cells infected with
modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and loaded with IgE
conferred protection in mice upon tumour challenge, slower
Figure 2 Tumour antigen uptake and presentation by dendritic
cells recruits cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes. Tumour cells display
tumour antigens at a high density, facilitating cross-linking of IgE
fixed to FceRI receptors on antigen-presenting cells, such as den-
dritic cells (DCs). Tumour antigens may be taken up via three possi-
ble routes: (1) soluble tumour antigen binding to receptor-bound
IgE; (2) By IgE-opsonized soluble antigen binding to IgE receptors
and (3) IgE-opsonized tumour cells binding to IgE receptors. Endo-
cytosis of IgE–antigen complexes leads to digestion in lysosomes
and loading of antigenic peptides on MHC I molecules. Cross-pre-
sentation via proteasome, loading to MHC I and recognition by
CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) is depicted.

 tumour growth and increased survival (85). This antitumour
adjuvant effect may depend on the interaction of IgE with
FceRI as it was lost in FceRIa�/� mice, but not in CD23�/�
mice. In parallel, using a humanized hFceRIa mouse model
expressing the human FceRIa chain, human IgE could exert
antitumour adjuvant effects (86). When a human truncated
mIgE (tmIgE) which retained binding to FceRI and trigger-
ing immune cell activation was inserted into a rMVA, the
resulting rMVA-tmIgE showed a protective effect in the
above humanized FceRIa mouse model (86).
Other anticancer vaccine approaches are based on specific
tumour antigens and tumour antigenic mimotopes which
have shown promise in restricting tumour growth (87). When
using
evolutionarily
conserved
cancer
antigens,
such
as
HER2/neu or EGFR, a vaccine may be used across different
species (88). Furthermore, the formulation with adjuvants
like aluminium hydroxide, orally sucralfate or proton pump
inhibitors, may help to direct induction of protective IgE
antibody and merit careful study (89).
Recombinant IgE anticancer antibodies
Engineering antibodies with Fc regions of the IgE class
specific for cancer antigens is designed to (i) harness the
high affinity of this antibody isotype for its cognate Fce
receptors on tissue-resident and potentially tumour-resident
immune effector cells and (ii) utilize the properties of IgE to
exert immune surveillance in Th2 conditions such as in
tumour
microenvironments.
Recombinant
antibody
tech-
nologies and approaches to recombinant IgE (rIgE) produc-
tion
have
advanced
significantly
with
a
number
of
antibodies already engineered and tested in vitro and in vivo
(see Table 2). Recombinant IgE can be generated by differ-
ent cloning strategies (Fig. 3). While classical restriction
enzyme-based
cloning
requires
the
presence
of
specific
restriction sites flanking the gene of interest, expression of
IgE by insect cells requires a recombinant baculovirus stock
containing the antibody expression cassette. Novel protocols
enable site-specific transposition of the coding sequence
using bacmid-containing E. coli as intermediate hosts. Poly-
merase Incomplete Primer Extension cloning, independent of
restriction or other recombination sites, facilitates rapid
cloning with the option of site-specific mutagenesis at the
same time. Human/mouse chimaeric IgEs were also gener-
ated by hybridoma technology from a knock-in mouse
strain (90), and more efficient cloning strategies using mam-
malian expression vectors are available (91). In future fully
human IgE antibodies could be generated from synthetic
human antibody repertoire libraries (92), or cloned directly
from the B cells of patients (93).
Also the heavily glycosylated structure of the IgE antibody
class has to be considered. IgE has seven glycosylation sites,
six of which are occupied mainly by complex N-glycans
including terminal galactose, sialic acid and fucose structures
(94). Oligomannosidic structures are only identified at posi-
tion Asn394 (94), and some evidence suggests that they may
be involved in binding to IgE Fc receptors and in some bio-
logical activities of IgE (95). On the other hand, complex N-

 glycosylation of IgE is not thought to have a direct impact
on its ability to bind to FceRI or CD23. The contribution of
glycosylation on IgE binding to galectin-3 and galectin-9 (96)
remains unclear. There is increasing evidence that the glyco-
sylation of IgEs in healthy and different disease states may
vary, prompting the need for further research on the impor-
tance of glycans on IgE functions against cancer.
In vitro effector functions of IgE antibodies in the cancer
context
Eosinophil,
monocyte
and
macrophage-mediated
ADCC/
ADCP, antigen presentation by DCs and degranulation of
mast cells and basophils, have been identified as potent
mechanisms of IgE-mediated anticancer functions in vitro
(69, 97, 98) (Fig. 1B).
The ADCC/ADCP functions against cancer of the anti-
folate receptor-alpha (FRa) IgE, MOv18, have been previ-
ously described (59). Recently, the therapeutic anti-HER2/
neu and anti-EGFR IgG1 antibodies, trastuzumab (Her-
ceptin�, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and cetux-
imab (Erbitux�, Merck Biopharma, Darmstadt, Germany),
respectively, have been cloned and engineered recombinantly
as humanized and chimaeric IgE antibodies (99, 100). Using
U937 monocytic effector cells (101), trastuzumab IgG1 medi-
ated killing of HER2-overexpressing CT26 murine as well as
of SKBR3 human mammary carcinoma cells mainly by
ADCP, whereas trastuzumab IgE mediated killing via ADCC
(99). Similarly, cetuximab IgG1 and IgE mediated compara-
ble levels of phagocytosis of EGFR-overexpressing A431
human tumour cells by purified human monocytes, but cetux-
imab IgE triggered significantly higher levels of ADCC than
IgG1 (100). Eosinophil ADCC killing has also been demon-
strated in vitro using an anti-human CD20 IgE antibody
against OCl-Ly8 lymphoma cells (54). Incubation with this
anti-CD20 IgE stimulated cord blood-derived mast cells to
release IL-8 and kill CD20+ tumour cells. Similarly, trastuzu-
mab IgE, cetuximab IgE, anti-PSA IgE, and MOv18 IgE
activated RBL SX-38 rat basophilic leukaemia cells when
cross-linked with anti-IgE antibody engaged with multimeric
antigen, or when incubated with target cells overexpressing
specific tumour-associated antigen (84, 99, 100, 102). In con-
trast, monomeric soluble tumour antigen did not trigger
degranulation (84, 100, 102). Accordingly, incubation of
MOv18 IgE-sensitized RBL SX-38 cells with patient sera
containing elevated levels of soluble FRa, did not lead to
mast cell degranulation. Furthermore, MOv18 IgE did not
trigger the basophil activation in the presence of soluble FRa,
which is highly elevated in the sera of subsets of ovarian carci-
noma and mesothelioma patients (102). This suggests that in
tumours,
mast
cells
may
release
potent
inflammatory
mediators in the presence of tumour-specific IgE and overex-
pressed tumour antigen, while IgE in the absence of multimeric
antigen is not expected to trigger anaphylactic responses.
Notably, antigenic epitopes also need to be displayed in a rigid
spacing to lead to productive triggering (103). Given that the
potent anticancer functions of IgE antibodies in vitro, it is
important to consider these results in the patient context (104).
The impact of soluble tumour antigen in the circulation has
been considered from a safety perspective (97, 102). However,
the possible inhibitory activity of soluble tumour antigen
sequestering IgE and preventing tumour cell engagement with
effector cells needs to be elucidated.
Furthermore, the ability of patient immune effector cells to
eradicate malignant cells must be evaluated to consider: (i)
the impact of treatments as chemotherapy or steroid intake
on effector cell functions, (ii) the effect of the tumour
microenvironment on IgE receptor expression and on killing
properties of these effector cells, and (iii) whether IgE
immunotherapy may itself re-educate effector cells to enhance
their antitumour functions (105).
In vivo models in AllergoOncology
Various animal models have been successfully employed to
study the in vivo efficacy of IgE antibodies against cancer
(106), with different limitations.
Direct application of human IgE in tumour bearing mice is
not applicable as human IgE does not bind rodent Fce recep-
tors (Table 3). Next, humans express FceRI on a broad
range of cells including monocytes, mast cells, basophils,
eosinophils, platelets, Langerhans cells and DCs (Table 1),
whereas murine FceRI expression has only been confirmed
on mast cells and basophils (Table 4). Furthermore, also
CD23 can be found on numerous human cells, while mice
express CD23 on only B cells and certain T cells (106).
Despite these differences, a xenograft model with severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, and a patient-
derived xenograft model of ovarian carcinoma both reconsti-
tuted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were
successfully used to demonstrate the superior tumour-killing
potential of MOv18 IgE over IgG1 via both CD23 and
FceRI (59, 107). More human-relevant models have been
established using transgenic mice strains that express human
FceRIa, which complexes with endogenous murine FcRb
and
FcRc
subunits,
forming
fully
functional
tetrameric
FceRI on mast cells and possibly trimeric receptors on
macrophages, Langerhans cells and eosinophils, with a tissue
distribution like in humans (108–110). A human anti-HER2/
neu (C6MH3-B1 IgE) IgE tested in this model significantly
prolonged the survival of immunocompetent mice bearing
HER2/neu-expressing tumours (83). A constraint of these

 transgenic models is the lack of CD23 expression, precluding
evaluation
of
IgE-triggered
CD23-mediated
phagocytosis
(111). A surrogate immunocompetent model system of syn-
geneic carcinoma in rats aims to better recapitulate the
human IgE immune system (105), as FceRI and CD23
expression and cellular distribution in rat cells, including
monocytes and macrophages, mirrors that of humans.
Relevant models to address toxicity of human IgE antibod-
ies are nonhuman primates (NHP) such as cynomolgus
(Macaca fascicularis) and rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys,
as they have been shown to mediate anaphylaxis induced by
human IgE (112). Cynomolgus monkeys have been routinely
used to evaluate the safety of IgG therapeutic antibodies cur-
rently used in the clinic. A fully human IgE antibody target-
ing HER2/neu (C6MH3-B1 IgE), administered systemically,
was also well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys (83). How-
ever, while recent studies confirmed the cross-reactivity of
human IgE with cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood leuco-
cytes (PBLs) with comparable binding kinetics, human IgE
dissociates faster from cynomolgus monkey PBLs and trig-
gers a different cytokine release profile (113). This is impor-
tant in toxicity studies using IgE in this species. Further, also
differences in the interaction of FccRs with the various
human IgG isotypes have been found (114). Thus, while
NHP are meaningful models for toxicity studies of human
antibodies, they must be used with caution.
The dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is another potential model,
as dogs suffer from spontaneous cancer and atopic diseases,
making them a relevant clinical experimental model (115).
For instance, the canine counterparts to HER2/neu and
canine EGFR expression are highly homologous to the
human molecules, and can be targeted by trastuzumab and
cetuximab (88). An additional advantage is the remarkable
similarity of the human and dog immune systems in terms of
immunoglobulin classes, IgE and FceRI expression and func-
tional homology (116). Thus, canine anti-EGFR IgG has
been generated (117) and IgE is currently being generated for
comparative studies in canine cancer patients.

AllergoOncology: EAACI position paper
 The described animal models are informative for preclini-
cal testing, but clinical trials in human patients are required
to fully understand the therapeutic potential and risks associ-
ated with IgE anticancer antibodies.
Allergy in clinical oncology: a cross-disciplinary field
Allergic reactions to anticancer drugs are a common clinical
problem,
seen
especially
with
platinum
drugs,
taxanes,
anthracyclines
(118)
and
monoclonal
antibodies
(mAbs)
(119). In some cases, it is the excipient rather than the drug
itself that is responsible for the hypersensitivity reaction. The
administration of some of these drugs is routinely preceded
by premedication with steroids.
Treatment of allergic anticancer drug reactions is, as for
other episodes of hypersensitivity, using intravenous fluids,
antihistamines, steroids and antipyretics, depending on the
risk evaluation (Fig. 4A). Desensitization algorithms can be
used in cases of established drug allergy, in which escalating
small doses of the drug are administered in a controlled envi-
ronment with ready access to critical care facilities (120)
(Table 5). Desensitization has a particular role to play in
clinical scenarios where repeated rechallenge with an active
drug may be required, as in the management of ovarian can-
cer, but also in allergy to anticancer mAbs (121).
Due to the increased utilization of chemotherapies and tar-
geted mAbs hypersensitivity reactions to these medications
have increased dramatically worldwide, preventing the use of
first-line therapies, with consequent impact in patient’s sur-
vival and quality of life (122). These reactions can range
from mild cutaneous reactions to life-threatening symptoms
including anaphylactic shock with IgE and/or mast cell/

 basophil involvement, and occur during or within one 1 h of
the drug infusion or hours–days, as these patients have exten-
sive premedications, including steroids (123). The symptoms
are associated with the release of tryptase and other media-
tors such as histamine, leukotrienes and prostaglandins,
implicated in the cutaneous, respiratory, gastrointestinal and
cardiovascular symptoms (124). Other systemic symptoms
such as chills and fever are thought to be due to the release
of IL-1 and IL-6 among others (125). Atypical symptoms
such as pain have been associated with taxanes and some
monoclonal antibodies (126). Deaths have been reported
when re-exposing patients to chemotherapy drugs to which
they have presented immediate hypersensitivity reactions
(127). Delayed reactions can present as either mast cell/ba-
sophil-mediated symptoms or as delayed cell-mediated-type
intravenous (i.v.) hypersensitivity (128).
There is increasing evidence that patients with immediate
and delayed hypersensitivity to chemotherapy and mono-
clonal
antibodies
can
be
safely
re-exposed
to
these
medications
through
rapid
drug
desensitization
(RDD)
(129), in which diluted amounts of drug are reintroduced
through a multistep protocol, achieving the target dose in
few hours (Fig. 4B). Thereby, inhibitory mast cell mecha-
nisms protect the patients against anaphylaxis (130). Most
patients with hypersensitivity reactions are candidates for
RDD, except for patients with Steven Johnsons syndrome
(SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosino-
philia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute eczema-
tous generalized pustulosis. The success of RDD relies on
personalized protocols (131). Platins including carboplatin,
cisplatin and oxaliplatin, taxanes including paclitaxel and
docetaxel, and monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab,
trastuzumab and cetuximab have been successfully desensi-
tized
(132). The largest
desensitization
study worldwide
reported that 370 highly allergic patients received 2177 suc-
cessful desensitizations to 15 drugs, three of which (beva-
cizumab, tocilizumab and gemcitabine) were unprecedented
and in which 93% of the procedures had no or mild

 reactions, 7% moderate to severe reactions which did not
preclude the completion of the treatment, and there were no
deaths (Fig. 4C) (133). The study indicates that the overall
health costs were not increased over standard treatment.
Most importantly, a group of women with ovarian cancer
sensitized to carboplatin had a non-statistically significant
lifespan advantage over nonallergic controls.
Therefore,
IgE-
and
non-IgE-mediated
chemotherapy
hypersensitivity reactions can be managed by RDD, enabling
sensitized patients to receive the full treatment safely, thus
representing an important advance in the patient’s treatment
and prognosis.
Conclusions
This position paper summarizes current knowledge and
developments in the field of AO since (1). Novel insights
gained highlight the merits of studying the nature of Th2
immune
responses
in
cancer,
much
of
which
remains
insufficiently
understood.
Epidemiologic
analyses
support
associations between allergies, allergen-specific and total IgE
levels with lower risk of cancer development, to date only
shown with regard to specific malignancies. Whether these
associations relate to antigen- or allergen-specific responses
or whether they represent protective effects of IgE through
recognition of specific tumour antigens remains unclear.
Understanding these associations and the contributions of
IgE and Th2 immunity in protection from cancer growth
would also contribute to understanding whether patients with
allergic asthma who receive anti-IgE treatment may be at risk
of developing cancer. Short-term follow-up findings have not
revealed any enhanced risk of cancer development to date
(134); however, further longer follow-up studies and novel
functional insights will be informative.
Emerging studies further support the study of the prototypic
Th2 isotype, IgE as a means to combat tumours when directed
against cancer antigens through promoting the interaction
between effector and cancer cells, and stimulating CTLs via

 antigen cross-presentation. Collectively, these findings support
the unique properties of IgE to activate anticancer immune
responses in passive and active immunotherapy of cancer and
provide evidence of safety. Whereas cell-fixed tumour antigen
can trigger cross-linking of IgE on its Fc receptors expressed
on effector cells, monovalent soluble antigen does not. Some
in vivo models relevant to IgE biology have been designed with
careful consideration of species-specific IgE receptor expres-
sion profile. Mouse models have been used most often,
whereas rats, dogs and NHP may offer new alternatives to
address specific questions of potency, safety and function. A
couple of recombinant anticancer IgE antibodies are in the
pipeline, and parallel interrogation of the same antibody
immunotherapies in clinical oncology will determine the pre-
dictive value of in vivo models.
Recent findings shed light into the alternative Th2 anti-
body isotype IgG4 and its expression and functions in mela-
noma and other cancers (135). The mechanisms of this
humoral immune bias in oncology merit further in-depth
study. Finally, it has to be emphasized that allergic reactions
to anticancer agents, chemotherapy and biologics represent
important challenges in daily clinical oncology practice,
which can be dealt with by desensitization protocols analo-
gous to those used in allergen immunotherapy.
In summary, the AO field represents an open interdisci-
plinary science forum where different aspects of the interface
between allergy and cancer are systematically addressed and
discussed, gaining thereby previously unappreciated insights
for cancer immunotherapy.
