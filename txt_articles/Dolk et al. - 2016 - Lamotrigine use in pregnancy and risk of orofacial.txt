Lamotrigine use in pregnancy and risk of
orofacialcleftandothercongenitalanomalies
ABSTRACT
Objective: To test previous signals of a risk of orofacial cleft (OC) and clubfoot with exposure to
the antiepileptic lamotrigine, and to investigate risk of other congenital anomalies (CA).
Methods: This was a population-based case–malformed control study based on 21 EUROCAT CA
registries covering 10.1 million births (1995–2011), including births to 2005 in which the clubfoot
signal was generated and a subsequent independent study population of 6.3 million births. A total of
226,806 babies with CA included livebirths, stillbirths, and terminations of pregnancy following prenatal
diagnosis. First-trimester lamotrigine monotherapy exposure in OC cases and clubfoot cases was com-
pared to other nonchromosomal CA (controls). Odds ratios (OR) were adjusted for registry. An explora-
tory analysis compared the proportion of each standard EUROCAT CA subgroup among all babies with
nonchromosomal CA exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy with non-AED exposed pregnancies.
Results: There were 147 lamotrigine monotherapy-exposed babies with nonchromosomal CA. For
all OC, ORadj was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73–2.33), isolated OC 1.45 (95% CI
0.80–2.63), isolated cleft palate 1.69 (95% CI 0.69–4.15). Overall ORadj for clubfoot was 1.83
(95% CI 1.01–3.31) and 1.43 (95% CI 0.66–3.08) in the independent study population. No
other specific CA were significantly associated with lamotrigine monotherapy.
Conclusions: The risk of OC was not significantly raised and we estimate the excess risk of OC to
be less than 1 in every 550 exposed babies. We have not found strong independent evidence of a
risk of clubfoot subsequent to our original signal. Our study cannot assess the general malforma-
tion risk among lamotrigine-exposed pregnancies. Neurology® 2016;86:1716–1725

Lamotrigine is commonly used for both epilepsy and bipolar disorder.1,2 Evidence of a good
teratogenic safety profile relative to other antiepileptic drugs (AED), with an overall congenital
anomaly (CA) risk close to background expectation in cohort studies,3–6 has encouraged use for
women of childbearing age and pregnant women.1 However, there are concerns about phar-
macokinetics and seizure risk in pregnancy5,7 and lamotrigine is not effective for some people
with epilepsy.8 A warning about the specific risk of orofacial clefts (OC) is given in patient
information (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency 2015), due to a signal

 from the North American AED registry of a
6-fold risk of OC, specifically cleft palate.9,10
A number of studies have been published
since,6,11–13 none of which has produced fur-
ther evidence to support an excess risk of this
magnitude.
EUROCAT is network of population-
based CA registries.14 In 2008, we tested the
signal of an increased risk of OC with lamo-
trigine monotherapy by analyzing data from
19 registries for the period 1995–2005.13 In
an exploratory analysis, we found evidence of
an excess risk of clubfoot, which could have
been a chance finding and constituted a signal
requiring confirmation in independent data.13
Our objective in this new study was to enlarge
the study population in order to estimate more
precisely the relative risk of OC, to follow-up
the clubfoot signal, and to explore evidence of
risk of other CA subgroups.
METHOD Study design.
1. Case-malformed control design to test OC and clubfoot
signals.
2. Exploratory analysis comparing proportion of each CA sub-
group between lamotrigine-exposed and non-AED-exposed.
Study population and registry data. The EUROCAT central
database contains anonymized, individual CA registrations,
including livebirths, fetal deaths from 20 weeks’ gestation, and
terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA). One syn-
drome and up to 8 anomalies are coded by ICD-9/10 codes.15
Babies with only minor anomalies according to the EUROCAT
list15 are excluded. Other variables include maternal age, maternal
disease before and during pregnancy (ICD coded 1 text), and
medications taken in the first trimester of pregnancy (Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical coded16).15 Information about maternal
medication exposure is mainly obtained from medical records
of pregnancy, and some registries also use maternal interviews
after birth or prescription databases (table 1).17

 Twenty-one population-based registries participated—the 19
registries of the previous study,13 and Finland and Sweden, which
as associate EUROCAT members transmitted data for this study.
The study population comprised 10.1 million births from 1995
to 2011 (table 1), of which 6.3 million were an independent
study population (table 1). One woman may have more than
one baby in the study population.
TOPFA were excluded in Norway and Sweden due to lacking
medication exposure information. TOPFA in Emilia Romagna
and Saxony-Anhalt were retained despite known exposure
underascertainment.
Classification of congenital anomalies. There were 226,806
CA registrations in the study population, divided into nonchro-
mosomal (n 5 199,515, 88%) and chromosomal CA (n 5
27,291, 12%). Nonchromosomal CA were classified into
EUROCAT standard CA subgroups.15 One baby can be counted
in more than one subgroup, but each baby is counted only once
when subgroups are combined. OC cases were divided into iso-
lated and multiply malformed (at least 2 major anomalies not part
of a syndrome, sequence, or complex) according to Coding &
Classification panel case review.18 Diagnoses of all lamotrigine-
exposed registrations were also reviewed by the panel.
Exposure definition. Registrations with maternal epilepsy or
AED exposure were verified with registries. Exposures were clas-
sified as monotherapy or polytherapy (use of 2 or more AED
types in the first trimester, concurrently or sequentially) and by
type of AED (lamotrigine, any AED, any AED excluding valproic
acid [VPA]). The category “any AED excluding VPA” was con-
structed due to established high teratogenicity of VPA. To avoid
misclassification, we excluded mothers with epilepsy without
recorded AED exposure (574 registrations, figure e-1 on the
Neurology® Web site at Neurology.org).
Forty-three registrations of the 259 with lamotrigine exposure
(22 mono, 21 poly, including 3 chromosomal registrations) were
confirmed as exposed during pregnancy but could not be con-
firmed as first trimester exposures and were excluded in sensitivity
analyses.
Case and control definition and classification. Orofacial
clefts. Cases were babies with nonsyndromic OC. Cases were
excluded where OC was part of a chromosomal, monogenic, or ter-
atogenic syndrome or secondary to another primary anomaly (figure
e-1). A subanalysis for cleft palate was performed since this was more
strongly associated with lamotrigine in the original signal.10
Controls were babies with nonchromosomal major CA
excluding OC.
Clubfoot. Cases were babies with nonchromosomal clubfoot
excluding spina bifida sequence (2% of all clubfoot) (figure e-1).
Controls were babies with nonchromosomal nonclubfoot
major CA.
Lamotrigine monotherapy-exposed clubfoot cases were further
classified as unilateral/bilateral, and the exclusion of positional tali-
pes,15 a much more common minor anomaly, was verified. For
comparison, diagnostic details and treatment type were provided
for a random sample of 308 out of 1,429 clubfoot registrations in
16 registries (1995–2009): for each registry (excluding Finland,
Sweden, Hainaut, Poland, and Strasbourg), a random 20 clubfoot
registrations, or all clubfoot registrations if fewer than 20. Of the
308 sampled registrations, a questionnaire was filled in for 301.
Thirteen cases (4.3%) were found not to have the major anomaly
clubfoot (e.g., cases of positional talipes), leaving 288 for analysis.
Statistical analysis. Crude odds ratios (ORs) were calculated
first. WinBUGS was used to fit multinomial responses with a
logistic link, including registries with no exposure to lamotrigine
in either cases or controls, adjusting for registry. Noninformative
priors were used and therefore the credible intervals are equivalent
to confidence intervals (CIs). We also controlled for maternal age,
treated as a categorical variable (,20, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, and
351 years of age). Due to the small numbers of exposures to
lamotrigine, it was not possible to adjust simultaneously for both
registry and maternal age. ORs adjusted for registry were a priori
the outcome measure of choice due to the potential for confound-
ing arising from differences in both CA prevalence and exposure
prevalence among registries, and the lack of strong maternal age
effects for most nonchromosomal anomalies.19 Modeling with
Poisson regression produces almost identical results (not shown).
For the clubfoot analysis, ORs were calculated for the entire
study population (table 1) and for the independent study popu-
lation (table 1).
As it is not possible to estimate overall CA risk from a case-
malformed control study as this would require information about
nonmalformed babies, we also compared exposure to lamotrigine,
and any AED, among all nonchromosomal CA combined to expo-
sure among all chromosomal cases, assuming that exposure among
chromosomal CA would represent population exposure. We calcu-
lated crude OR and OR adjusted for maternal age due to the strong
relationship of maternal age to chromosomal anomalies.
In an exploratory proportional analysis, the number of babies
with each nonchromosomal CA subgroup was calculated as a pro-
portion of all babies with nonchromosomal CA, and was com-
pared between the lamotrigine-exposed registrations and the
non-AED-exposed registrations using Fisher exact test.
In a sensitivity analysis for OC, 6 OC cases (5 isolated, 1 mul-
tiply malformed) and 34 controls were excluded as lamotrigine
monotherapy/polytherapy exposure was of uncertain timing dur-
ing pregnancy. In a sensitivity analysis for clubfoot, 4 clubfoot
cases (3 lamotrigine monotherapy, 1 lamotrigine polytherapy)
including 1 case in the independent study population, and 36
controls, were excluded for the same reason.
Sensitivity analyses were also performed for the lamotrigine
monotherapy analysis whereby clubfoot was excluded from the
control group where cases were OC, and vice versa.

and
external
advisory
committee (EAC). The study was performed over 5 years, with
an interim analysis each year reviewed by an EAC consisting of a
pediatrician specialized in teratology, a neurologist specialized in
treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy, and a statistician. The EAC
identified no concern that should lead to early publication of
results. The report and comments received by the EAC and
response to those comments from the research team were for-
warded to GSK, who forwarded the report to the Medicines
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. This study was approved by the Ulster University Eth-
ics Committee. All contributing registries have their own ethics
approval arrangements according to national laws.
RESULTS AED exposure in the CA population. AED
exposure was recorded in 6.0 per 1,000 registrations
(table 2). AED monotherapy accounted for 80% of
AED exposure (table 2); 43% of CA registrations with
AED exposure had been exposed to VPA (table 2). Of
the AED exposed, 79% (n 5 1,073) had maternal
epilepsy recorded; others had AED for other indica-
tions, or had missing data regarding indication.

 Twelve percent of all AED-exposed CA registra-
tions were exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy
(table 2) and 7% to lamotrigine as part of polytherapy
(table 2). Among lamotrigine monotherapy expo-
sures, 77.1% were recorded with maternal epilepsy.
The proportion of lamotrigine monotherapy expo-
sures rose over time (table 2).
AED-exposed registrations were similar in mater-
nal age to unexposed registrations (29.2 vs 29.6
years), and lamotrigine-exposed registrations slightly
younger (28.4 years).
Registrations included 89.4% livebirths, 1.3%
stillbirths or late fetal deaths, and 9.3% TOPFA.
The rate of AED exposure was 6.13 per 1,000 regis-
trations among livebirths, 5.83 per 1,000 among fetal
deaths, and 4.93 per 1,000 among TOPFA.
OC. OC were significantly associated with AED expo-
sure (All OC ORadj 1.34, 95% CI 1.11–1.62; all cleft
palate ORadj 1.97, 1.54–2.52) with lower OR for
isolated OC/cleft palate (table 3). ORs remained ele-
vated after excluding VPA (table 3).
For lamotrigine monotherapy, there were nonsig-
nificant associations for all OC (ORadj 1.31, 95% CI
0.73–2.33) and for all cleft palate (ORadj 1.60, 95%
CI 0.70–3.65) (table 3). The ORs for isolated OC/
cleft palate were slightly higher but nonsignificant
(table 3). The ORs for all OC/cleft palate with lam-
otrigine monotherapy were nonsignificantly higher
than those for any AED monotherapy excluding
VPA (table 3).
In the sensitivity analysis excluding uncertain tim-
ing of lamotrigine exposure, adjusted ORs were
diluted (all OC: 1.22, 95% CI 0.63–2.34; isolated
OC: 1.46, 95% CI 0.76–2.80; all cleft palate: 0.97,
95% CI 0.31–3.09; isolated cleft palate: 1.23, 95%
CI 0.39–3.89).
A sensitivity analysis excluded clubfoot from the
controls: isolated OC OR 1.48 (0.74–2.69), all OC
1.33 (0.69–2.36), isolated cleft palate 1.70 (0.54–
4.07), and all cleft palate 1.60 (0.58–3.60).
Diagnostic review of lamotrigine monotherapy-
exposed babies in the control group found 3 pairs
of sibs where it is possible that the CA was genetically
linked to the epilepsy of the mother: one pair with
tuberous sclerosis, one with cleidocranial dysostosis
(rarely linked with epilepsy), and one with lissenceph-
aly. Exclusion of these cases from the controls in a
sensitivity analysis hardly changed the OR for OC.
There were no other sibpairs.
Clubfoot. There was no excess of clubfoot with any
AED exposure (ORadj 0.96, 95% CI 0.74–1.26)
(table 4). With lamotrigine monotherapy exposure,
there was a significant excess of clubfoot in the entire
study population (ORadj 1.83, 95% CI 1.01–3.31),
reduced and nonsignificant in the independent study
population (ORadj 1.43, 95% CI 0.66–3.08) (table
4). Excluding lamotrigine of uncertain timing did not
substantially change the estimates but the lower CI
limit was below 1 (overall ORadj 1.60, 95% CI 0.81–
3.15, independent study population ORadj 1.40,

 95% CI 0.61–3.22). Excluding OC from the con-
trols, OR estimates were nonsignificant: entire study
population OR 1.88 (0.94–3.38), independent study
population OR 1.52 (0.59–3.28).
Of the 12 lamotrigine monoexposed clubfoot
cases, 7 were bilateral and 11 were isolated, and all
cases were confirmed as clubfoot (i.e., not positional
talipes). This was similar to the profile in the random
comparison sample of unexposed clubfoot (55.2%
bilateral, 70.8% isolated, and 62.5% of liveborn cases
treated with splints/casts/surgery).
All nonchromosomal CA combined compared with all
chromosomal
CA.
There
were

lamotrigine
monotherapy-exposed nonchromosomal CA and 10
lamotrigine
monotherapy-exposed
chromosomal
controls, giving an OR of 1.77 (95% CI 0.93–
3.37), adjusted for maternal age. The OR adjusted
for maternal age for any AED was 2.25 (95% CI
1.78–2.85).
Exploratory analysis of CA subgroups. We observed
more cases of spina bifida than expected in the
lamotrigine-exposed group, but only for polytherapy
(table 5). We found a significant excess of respiratory
anomalies for lamotrigine monotherapy (table 5). These
cases were heterogeneous in diagnosis (table 5). They
include 5 cases of stenosis of the upper airways.
DISCUSSION This study of lamotrigine exposure in
early pregnancy more than doubled the size of the
previous study population13 (from 3.8 to 10 million
births) and added a period from 2006 onward when
lamotrigine exposure was nearly 3 times more preva-
lent. Our estimate of the risk of OC relative to other
anomalies is nonsignificant with an upper confidence
limit of 2.3 and therefore does not support the 6-fold
risk suggested by the North American AED cohort
results.10 Our results concur with other studies pub-
lished since the original signal,4,6,11,12 which do not
find a large excess of OC or cleft palate. One of the
reasons for the discrepancy with the original signal
may be that our baseline population risk of OC is
1.4 per 1,000, rather than the 0.7 per 1,000 baseline
estimated by the North American cohort,10 later
revised upwards to 1.1 per 1,000.5 The size of the
original OC signal may also have been a chance find-
ing, or exacerbated by coexposures. Based on our
European OC prevalence rate of 1.4 per 1,000, and
an upper confidence limit of OR of 2.3, we estimate
exposure to lamotrigine would result in OC in less
than 1 in every 550 exposed babies.
Cleft palate is considered to be etiologically dis-
tinct from cleft lip with or without palate,20 although
poor recording may lead to misclassification in some
studies in the literature. In a previous EUROCAT
study of VPA,21 we found an OR of 5.2 for cleft
palate with no increased risk for cleft lip. A previous
EUROCAT study of carbamazepine22 found no
excess of cleft lip and a small nonsignificant OR of
1.3 for cleft palate,22 whereas an excess of cleft lip was
reported in cohort studies in the literature.22 There is
a strong signal in the literature for topiramate and
OC, particularly cleft lip.5 We find a small excess risk
of OC with any AED excluding VPA of borderline
statistical significance (OR 1.33). However, due to
the case-malformed control design, this would be
diluted by inclusion of malformations associated with
AED in the control group (such as spina bifida asso-
ciated with carbamazepine22). The similarity with the
point estimate of OR for lamotrigine (1.31) is there-
fore difficult to interpret. OC have long been found
to be associated with anticonvulsant exposures of
many types,23 and there is inconclusive evidence ad-
dressing hypotheses as to whether some types of epi-
lepsy may be genetically linked to OC,23 whether
anticonvulsant medication accentuates the underly-
ing genetic tendency,23 or whether the medication
effects are independent of epilepsy. Given this con-
text, it is prudent to examine the baby of any woman
with epilepsy carefully for cleft palate, which may not
be externally visible, regardless of her medication.
In our previous study,13 we found a significant
excess of clubfoot. We have now validated the record-
ing of clubfoot as a major CA by EUROCAT regis-
tries. The only other evidence to support this
association has been 3 cases in 802 exposed

 pregnancies reported by the International Lamotri-
gine Pregnancy Registry.4 We sought to confirm the
signal13 in an independent dataset to exclude the pos-
sibility of it being a chance finding. We could not
find statistically significant independent evidence of a
clubfoot excess. However, the overall excess including
the original signal remains statistically significant. We
recommend that cohort studies also keep this anom-
aly under review using comparable diagnostic inclu-
sion criteria. Clubfoot has been associated with
exposure to various medications including selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors.24–26
No other CA were found to be associated with
lamotrigine monotherapy. An excess of respiratory
anomalies may be too heterogeneous to be interpreted
as causally associated, and may be a chance finding
due to the multiple comparisons performed, but
due to differing interpretations among reviewers of
these data we recommend other studies should
follow-up stenosis of the upper airways.
Limitations of case-malformed control studies are
that without a nonmalformed control group it is not
possible to estimate the overall CA risk associated
with exposure and that estimated OR may be diluted
if controls include CA associated with exposure.
Cohort studies have found an overall CA rate associ-
ated with lamotrigine exposure similar to background
expectation3–6 but do not have exact external
comparators. We estimated the OR of nonchromo-
somal CA by comparing with chromosomal syn-
dromes, assuming the latter to reflect population
exposure. The OR, adjusted for maternal age, of
1.77 (95% CI 0.93–3.37), although not statistically
significant and with a wide CI, is consistent with a
small generalized excess of nonchromosomal CA, and
thus an underestimation of our ORs for OC and
clubfoot. However, the elevated OR may also reflect
some underascertainment of lamotrigine exposure
among TOPFA, which are more common in chro-
mosomal syndromes.
The strengths of our study are the large sample size,
population base, detailed and standardized diagnostic
data on CA, and inclusion of TOPFA, which consti-
tute a large proportion of some CA.27 Due to the rarity
of OC and of lamotrigine exposure, the power to
detect clinically significant associations remains limited
and we therefore used the upper CI of the OR esti-
mates for OC when estimating excess risk. Unlike
most AED cohort studies, we have an internal com-
parator group. AED exposure was mainly prospectively
ascertained, and the case-malformed control study
design reduces recall and information bias. The AED
exposure rate of 6.0 per 1,000 suggests good ascertain-
ment, taking into account the expected population
AED exposure rate of 3–5 per 1,0001 and the excess
risk of CA among the AED exposed.21,22 We did not
