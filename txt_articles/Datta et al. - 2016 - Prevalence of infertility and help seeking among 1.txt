study question: What is the prevalence of infertility and of help seeking among women and men in Britain?
summary answer: One in eight women and one in ten men aged 16–74 years had experienced infertility, defined by unsuccessfully
attempting pregnancy for a year or longer, and little more than half of these people sought medical or professional help.
what is known already: Estimates of infertility and help seeking in Britain vary widely and are not easily comparable because of dif-
ferent definitions and study populations.
study design, size, duration: A cross-sectionalpopulation surveywasconducted between 2010and 2012 with a sample of 15 162
women and men aged 16–74 years.
participants/materials, setting, methods: Participants completed the Natsal-3 questionnaire, using computer-assisted
personal interviewing (CAPI) and computer-assisted self-interview (CASI).
main results and the role of chance: Thereportedprevalenceofinfertilitywas12.5%(CI95%11.7–13.3)amongwomenand
10.1% (CI 95% 9.2–11.1) among men. Increased prevalence was associated with later cohabitation with a partner, higher socio-economic status
and, for those who had a child, becoming parents at older ages. The reported prevalence of help seeking was 57.3% (CI 95% 53.6–61.0) among
women and 53.2% (CI 95% 48.1–58.1) among men. Help seekers were more likely to be better educated and in higher status occupations and,
among those who had a child, to have become parents later in life.
limitations, reasons for caution: These data are cross-sectional so it is not possible to establish temporality or infer causality.
Self-reported data may be subject to recall bias.
wider implications of the findings: Thestudyprovidesestimatesof infertilityand help seeking in Britain and theresultsindicate
that the prevalence of infertility is higher among those delaying parenthood. Those with higher educational qualifications and occupational status
are more likely to consult with medical professionals for fertility problems than others and these inequalities in help seeking should be considered
by clinical practice and public health.

 Introduction
Fertility is a key element of reproductive health and infertility is recog-
nized as a global public health issue by the World Health Organisation
(WHO) (Boivin et al., 2007; Macaluso et al., 2010). Infertility is defined
by the International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive
Technology (ICMART) and WHO as the ‘failure to achieve a pregnancy
after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse’
(Zegers-Hochschild et al., 2009). The National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for England and Wales concurs with
this time period, advocating that clinical assessment and investigation
should be offered when ‘a woman of reproductive age. . . has not con-
ceived after one year of unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse, in the
absence of any known cause of infertility’ (National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence, 2013). The experience of infertility can cause
those affected personal distress (Schneider and Forthofer, 2005; Greil
et al., 2011), significant treatment costs (Bell, 2010) and, in some con-
texts, ostracism and discrimination (Cui, 2010).
Infertility is experienced by an estimated 48.5 million couples world-
wide (Mascarenhas et al., 2012) and around 1 in 7 couples in the UK
(National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2013). However,
prevalence estimates of lifetime infertility vary widely, in part because
there is no agreed or consistent definition of infertility (Gurunath et al.,
2011) and because study populations vary by age range, unit of measure-
ment and relationship status.
A marked trend for delaying the timing of first birth has been seen in
developed and, more recently, developing countries (Gyimah, 2003;
Mathews and Hamilton, 2009; Rosero-Bixby et al., 2009; Mills et al.,
2011). A consequence of postponement of parenthood is the potential
for impaired fertility (Balasch, 2010) and the risk that deferral of parent-
hood will rule it out (Sobotka, 2006; Leridon, 2008).
Later parenthood, its implications for fertility, and the increased range
and availability of fertility treatments are likely to have had an impact on
help seeking. There is some evidence of an increase in the reporting of
fertility problems to primary care after the introduction of national treat-
ment guidelines, suggesting more awareness of assisted reproductive
technology (ART) (Dhalwani et al., 2013). Studies have found that
women in later age cohorts are more likely to seek help than women
in earlier ones and that women are seeking help at older ages than was
previously the case (Oakley et al., 2008; Wilkes et al., 2009). There
are few population-based data on experience of infertility and its deter-
minants or on the extent of help seeking, particularly for men. This study
uses data from the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Life-
styles (Natsal-3) to estimate the prevalence of infertility, and of seeking
medical or professional help among women and men in Britain, and to
examine associated factors.
Materials and Methods
Study population
Natsal-3 is a survey of 15 162 women (8869) and men (6293) aged 16–74
years. Households were selected using stratified probability sampling from
which one eligible individual resident in Britain was selected at random and
invited to participate. The sample frame was the Postcode Address File
(PAF), a regularly updated list of all addresses in the country. As the PAF
excludes those who are homeless or living in institutions, our sample is rep-
resentative of individuals living in private residential households. Data were
weighted intwostagestocorrectforparticipants’ unequalprobabilitiesofse-
lection. The first corrected for the selection of one household in multi-
household addresses and for the varying probabilities of selection by
number of adults within households. The second adjusted for differential
non-response by comparing age, sex and region profile of participants with
2011 census data. Although the Natsal-3 sample closely matched those
who responded to the census in terms of ethnicity (86.8% in Natsal-3 and
86.7% in the census were white), there was a slight under-representation
of Asian women and men in Natsal-3 (6.4%) compared with the census
(7.5%). Participants were interviewed between 2010 and 2012 using
computer-assisted
personal
interviewing
(CAPI),
which
included
a
computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) component for the more sensitive
questions. The response rate was 57.7% and the co-operation rate (i.e. of
all eligible addresses contacted) was 65.8%. Further details of the methods
are described elsewhere (Erens et al., 2014).
Questions about experience of infertility and help seeking for infertility
were asked of all Natsal-3 participants who reported ever having heterosex-
ual intercourse (8315 women and 5742 men). Two discrete questions were
asked: ‘Have you ever had a time, lasting 12 months or longer, when you and a
partner were trying for a pregnancy but it didn’t happen?’ and ‘Have you (or a
partner) ever sought medical or professional help about infertility?’. In line with
the NICE guideline (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,
2013), we considered a participant to have experienced infertility when
she or he responded ‘yes’ to the first question. Participants were also
asked questions that comprise the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-2
(PHQ-2) (Kroenke et al., 2003), a composite measure of depression experi-
enced in the 2 weeks prior to interviewand questions on satisfaction with sex
life and relationship in the past year.
Data are cross-sectional and we did not ask participants for information
about when their experience of infertility occurred. Some may have failed
toconceiveina12-month periodbeforebecoming parentsor betweenpreg-
nancies while others may never have become parents. Those still of repro-
ductive age could experience a future period of infertility. Natsal-3 data are
deposited at the UK Data Service. https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/
catalogue/?sn=7799 (11 May 2016, date last accessed).
Statistical analyses
We used STATAv13.1 (StataCorp, 2013) to undertake complex survey ana-
lysesto account for the weighting, clustering and stratification of the Natsal-3
data. We estimated the population prevalence of infertility and help seeking,
stratified by gender and age group. We used multivariable logistic regression
toexploreassociations(adjustedforageatinterview)betweenexperienceof
(i) infertility and (ii) help seeking, and a number of socio-demographic, rela-
tionship,reproductiveandhealthfactors,including:ageatinterview;relation-
ship status at interview; age at first cohabitation; age at first child; academic
attainment; employment status measured using National Statistics Socio-
Economic Classification (NS-SEC) and area-level deprivation measured
using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) (Office for National Statistics,
2010). We report results for educational attainment for those aged over
21 years only as younger participants may not have completed full-time
education. Finally, using multivariable logistic regression, we present age-
adjusted odds ratios to describe associations between experience of infertil-
ity and selected health and relationship ‘outcome’ variables for women
aged 50 years or younger. We selected this age group for analysis as their
experience of infertility will have occurred more recently than that of older
participants.
Ethical approval
The Natsal-3 study was approved by the Oxfordshire Research Ethics
Committee A (ref.: 10/H0604/27).

 Results
Prevalence of infertility and associated
factors
The proportion of participants aged 16–74 who reported ever having
tried unsuccessfully for a year or longer to become pregnant was 12.5%
among women and 10.1% among men (Table I). Unsurprisingly,
the prevalence of ever experience of infertility was lowest in the
youngest women and peaked among those aged 35–44 years
(17.7%). A similar pattern was seen for men but the age range
in which the prevalence of ever experience of infertility was highest
was wider than for women, extending from age 35 to 54 years at
interview.
The experience of infertility was associated with relationship factors.
It was highest among those who were married or cohabiting at
interview and lowest among those in a non-cohabiting partnership.
Among women, a positive association was found between older age
at first cohabitation and the experience of infertility. Age-adjusted
odds of experiencing infertility were significantly higher among
women who first gave birth at age 35 or older (AOR 5.57 (3.97–
7.83)) compared with those who did so before age 25. A similar,
though slightly weaker, association was observed among men (AOR
3.27 (2.16–4.96)).
We found evidence of associations between infertility and indicators
of socio-economic status. Experience of infertility was most common
among women with a degree and lowest among those with no
academic qualifications while no statistically significant association
was observed among men. Prevalence was also higher among those
in managerial, professional and technical employment compared
with those in routine occupations. No association was found
between infertility and area-related deprivation at interview among
women or men.
Among women, the only health indicator found to be meaningfully
associated with infertility was treatment for depression in the previous
12 months and the association was of only borderline significance
(Supplementary data, Table SI). Among men, we found associations
with ever having been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection
(men: AOR 1.39 (1.02–1.88)) and, specifically, with chlamydia (AOR
1.81 (1.15–2.84)).
Prevalence of help seeking for infertility
and associated factors
Atotalof57.3%ofwomenand53.2%ofmenwhohadeverexperienceof
infertility had sought medical or professional help as a result (Table II).
Figure 1 showsthe proportion of women and men with experience of in-
fertility who sought help for the problem by age group at interview.
Less than one-third (32.6%) of the youngest women (16–24 years) and
only 14.1% of the youngest men with experience of infertility reported
seeking help. Among both women and men, similar proportions of those
aged 35–74 had sought help (women: 58.0–64.9%; men: 53.1–58.1%).
Age-adjusted odds ratios showed help seeking to be higher among
those who were currently married or cohabiting compared with those
in non-cohabiting or not in ‘steady’ partnerships. Prevalence of seeking
help was highest in women who first cohabited in their twenties while,
among men, it was highest in those who first cohabited aged 30 or older.
For women, having had a child and older age at first birth were both
associated with seeking help for fertility; help seeking was highest
among women who became mothers at 35 or older (74.6% (62.8–
83.7)). The association between age at first child and help seeking was
less marked among men. Of those who had never had a child, 58.7%
(95% CI 51.5–65.4) of women and 54.9% (95% CI 46.6–62.9) of men
reported having sought help.
Help seeking was significantly associated with indicators of socio-
economic position. Women and men with lower levels of education
and lower occupational classifications (as indicated by the NS-SEC)
were less likely to have sought help. Associations between help
seeking and area-level deprivation at interview were of borderline signifi-
cance among women only.
Health indicators were not associated with likelihood of having sought
help for infertility although there was a borderline association suggesting
that men who reported regular heavy drinking were slightly less likely to
have sought help (Supplementary data, Table SII).

 this analysis. We found a positive and significant association between
ever experience of infertility and symptoms of depression in the 2
weeks before interview and dissatisfaction with sex life in the past year
among women aged 50 and under. These associations remained after
controlling for potential confounding factors including age at interview,
educational qualification, relationship status at interview, duration of re-
lationship, age at first cohabitation and parental status. We examined
whether having children or not moderated the association between
experience of infertility and depression and identified no evidence of
an interaction (P ¼ 0.698). Given the limitations of the data, we do not
know whether depression or sexual dissatisfaction was related to
the use of fertility treatments. We found no significant association
between women’s experience of infertility and whether they were
happy with their current relationship. Among men, no significant associ-
ation wasobserved between the experienceof infertilityand depression,
dissatisfaction with sex life, or happiness with relationship (analysis not
shown).
Discussion
Inthisstudy,weprovidepopulationprevalenceestimatesofinfertilityand
help seeking among women and men in Britain using national probability
survey data. One in eight women and one in ten men experienced infer-
tility defined by unsuccessfully attempting pregnancy for a year or more.
Women and men who settled later with a partner, had highereducation-
al attainment and occupational status and, among those who did have a
child,becameparentsatolderagesweremorelikelytohaveexperienced
infertility.
Little more than half of women and men who had experienced infer-
tilityhadsoughtmedicalorprofessionalhelpfortheproblem.Thosewho
did so were better educated and in higher status occupations and, if they
were parents, were more likely to have had children at older ages. These
characteristics were more marked among women than men. Women
aged 50 or younger who had experience of infertility were more likely
to report recent symptoms of depression and dissatisfaction with their
sex life. We found that ever experience of infertility and of help
seeking were associated with few current health factors for women or
men.
A strength of this study is the size of the sample and the fact that it is
population-based. Natsal-3 includes data on sexual and reproductive
health as well as behavioural and relationship variables less common in
health surveys. A limitation isthat,although wemeasureeverexperience
of infertility, some explanatory variables refer to recent time frames. As
data arecross-sectional, it is not possible to establish temporalityor infer
causality and we cannot establish the age of participants when they
experienced infertility or sought help, or the timing of these experiences
relative to having children for those who did. Self-reported data may be
subject torecallbias. Itwasnot possibleto explore associations between
infertility and participant ethnicity as numbers were too small.
Our estimates of infertility are broadly in line with those found by pre-
vious studies although prevalence estimates differ as a result of diverse
definitions and study populations. Earlier estimates of women experien-
cing infertility range from around 1 in 5 (Bhattacharya et al., 2009;
Cabrera-Leo
´n et al., 2015) to around 1 in 10 (Evers, 2002) with the Na-
tionalWomen’sHealthStudyreportingabout1in6(Oakleyetal.,2008).
Estimates of couples’ experience of infertility also vary. Hull et al. (1985)

Prevalence of infertility and help seeking

 estimated it to be around one in six while NICE cites estimates of one in
seven (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2013).
A large body of literature describes the trend among women in devel-
oped countries to delay having children (Schmidt et al., 2012) and it is
proposed that this changing fertility tempo is becoming a global phenom-
enon (Rosero-Bixby et al., 2009; Sobotka, 2010).
Our finding that infertility was more commonly experienced by
married or cohabiting participants probably reflects the fact that those
in stable relationships are more likely to have attempted pregnancy
and therefore become aware of fertility problems. The much lower
prevalence among young people reflects in part that they may never
have tried to get pregnant. Previous studies have noted the extended
period of transition to adulthood (Stone et al., 2014) and the widening
intervals between the key reproductive events of first sex, first cohabit-
ation and first birth (Wellings et al., 2013). Researchers taking a life
course perspective (Morgan and Rackin, 2010; Berrington and Pattaro,
2014) have observed discrepancies between individuals’ fertility inten-
tions and their subsequent family size, highlighting the complex inter-
action of childhood socialization with personal and structural factors.
Influences on postponement for women include the increase in
women’s participation in further education (Andersson et al., 2008; Nı
´
Bhrolcha
´in and Beaujouan, 2012) and in career development (Martin,
2000; Morris et al., 2011), the absence of a ‘suitable’ partner (Proudfoot
et al., 2009), partner’s expectations (Iacovou and Tavares, 2011) and
perceptions of how parenthood will reduce individual autonomy (Lief-
broer, 2005).
Our estimate that 57% of women sought medical help for infertility is
close to that reported by an international review which estimated that
56% of women in more developed countries sought help (Boivin et al.,
2007), and by a Finnish study (Tera
¨va
¨ et al., 2008) which found that
57% of all subfertile women did so. Other studies (Greil and McQuillan,
2004; Morris et al., 2011; Chandra et al., 2014) have reported higher and
lowerestimatesbut, becauseof differences in studygroupsand outcome
measures, comparison is not possible.
Our analyses show that women aged 50 or under who experienced
infertility were more likely to report recent symptoms of depression
and dissatisfaction with their sex life. Infertility is associated with psycho-
logical distress (Cousineau and Domar, 2007; Greil et al., 2011) and
patients findtheprocess ofundergoinginfertility treatmentanditsuncer-
tainoutcomestressful(Sbaraglietal.,2008;Volgstenetal.,2008;Schmidt
et al., 2013). The longer term impact of infertility on mental health and
sexual well-being is less well known. A Danish studyshows a relationship
between unsuccessful ARTand severe depressive symptoms ayearafter
initiating treatment (Lund et al., 2009) and another, also Danish, found
women who did not have a child after fertility treatment were more
likely to commit suicide than those who did (Kjaer et al., 2011). Previous
researchhasfoundassociationsbetweenundergoingtreatmentforinfer-
tility and sexual dissatisfaction, particularly among women (Millheiser
et al., 2012; Wischmann, 2010; Marci et al., 2012).
The large minority of research participants who experienced infertility
butdidnotseekmedicalhelpisofconcern,asarethemarkedinequalities
in help seeking between those who are well qualified and in high status
employment and those who are not. These findings are in line with
other studies from Europe, North America and Australia (Tera
¨va
¨
et al., 2008; Bushnik et al., 2012; Chambers et al., 2013; Chandra et al.,
2014). Several explanations for not seeking (or pursuing) help for infer-
tility have been suggested, including not understanding or acknowledging
that a problem exists (White et al., 2006), fear of being labelled infertile
(Bunting and Boivin, 2007), concerns about the cost of treatment (Eisen-
berg et al., 2010), lack of intent to conceive (Greil and McQuillan, 2004)
and the physical and psychological burden of treatment (Verberg et al.,
2008). These do not provide a clear rationale for why there should be
a distinction between indicators of social status and the likelihood of
seeking help, although it has been suggested that acknowledging lack of
conception as a problem to be solved is a motivation for seeking treat-
ment and that highly educated women may be better informed about
how long conception might typically take (Morris et al., 2011).
Interventions to encourage help seeking include raising public aware-
ness about reproductiverisks and strategiesto minimise them (Macaluso
et al., 2010), general practitioners taking opportunities to discuss fertility
with patients (Davies, 2015), greater access to fertility treatments
(Bunting and Boivin, 2007) and an acknowledgement of the psychosocial
impacts of infertility, including the long-term effects, by health practi-
tioners and the availability of appropriate support (Hinton et al., 2012).
