SUMMARY
Perceptual decisions require the accumulation of
sensory information to a response criterion. Most
accounts of how the brain performs this process
of temporal integration have focused on evolving
patterns of spiking activity. We report that sub-
threshold changes in membrane voltage can repre-
sent accumulating evidence before a choice. ab
core Kenyon cells (abc KCs) in the mushroom
bodies of fruit flies integrate odor-evoked synaptic
inputs to action potential threshold at timescales
matching the speed of olfactory discrimination.
The forkhead box P transcription factor (FoxP) sets
neuronal integration and behavioral decision times
by controlling the abundance of the voltage-gated
potassium channel Shal (KV4) in abc KC dendrites.
abc KCs thus tailor, through a particular constella-
tion of biophysical properties, the generic process
of synaptic integration to the demands of sequential
sampling.
INTRODUCTION
Decisions take time because the information needed to make
them is rarely available all at once but must be gathered
sequentially. A large literature, whose beginnings stretch back
to the 19th century (Donders, 1869), documents systematic var-
iations in the speed of perceptual judgments with stimulus
strength: easy decisions, based on unambiguous evidence,
tend to be fast, whereas difficult decisions, based on weak or
conflicting data, tend to be slow (Hanes and Schall, 1996; Roit-
man and Shadlen, 2002; Shadlen and Newsome, 2001; Vickers,
1970). This difficulty-dependent cost of decision time likely re-
flects the need to construct time-averaged sensory representa-
tions. Just as engineers average signals over time to reduce the
effects of contaminating noise, the brain appears to improve its
signal-to-noise ratio by integrating information from sequential
samples. The neural structures and mechanisms responsible
for the execution and termination of this integration process
remain incompletely understood (Gold and Shadlen, 2007;
Shadlen and Kiani, 2013).
From first principles, accumulating information must be
encoded in time-varying neural signals that span the evi-
dence-gathering period. Smooth ramps or discrete steps in
firing frequency or domino-like activity sequences, which can
all be observed before choices are made, have been inter-
preted to represent these signals (Gold and Shadlen, 2007;
Hanes and Schall, 1996; Harvey et al., 2012; Latimer et al.,
2015; Roitman and Shadlen, 2002; Shadlen and Newsome,
2001; Shadlen and Kiani, 2013). The decision is considered
complete when the mean spike rate in the population crosses
a threshold or the activity sequence joins a choice-specific
trajectory. However, there is little evidence that changing the
slope of a ramp or the order or speed at which activity propa-
gates through a sequence alters decision times. And although
mechanisms for producing the requisite spiking dynamics
have been advanced theoretically (Rajan et al., 2016; Wang,
2002), experimental support for these mechanisms has been
difficult to obtain.
Like mammals, fruit flies take longer to commit to difficult
perceptual choices than to easy ones (DasGupta et al., 2014),
and the same quantitative relationships—formalized by drift-
diffusion models of evidence accumulation (Bogacz et al.,
2006; Ratcliff, 1978; Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008)—link speed,
accuracy, and task difficulty. When flies discriminate between
two odor concentrations, the amount of time taken is influenced
by a small, genetically distinct (Aso et al., 2014a; Tanaka et al.,
2008) population of third-order olfactory neurons: the ab core
Kenyon cells (abc KCs) of the mushroom bodies (DasGupta
et al., 2014). The decision-relevant abc KCs encompass just
�160 of the 100,000 neurons in the fly brain and are distin-
guished by the expression of the forkhead box P transcription
factor (FoxP) (DasGupta et al., 2014), an ancestral member (San-
tos et al., 2011) of a transcription factor family of considerable
interest in molecular and developmental neurobiology, cognitive
science, linguistics, and evolutionary anthropology (Enard et al.,
2002; Hamdan et al., 2010; Konopka et al., 2009; Lai et al., 2001;
Vargha-Khadem et al., 1995). Drosophila FoxP mutants are
slower to make difficult odor intensity discriminations than
wild-type flies, and, in some allelic combinations, are also
more error prone (DasGupta et al., 2014). Here, we study the
mechanism of sequential sampling through the prism of the
FoxP mutation: we identify how FoxP shapes the integrative
capabilities of abc KCs and relate these capabilities to the deci-
sion-making behavior of the animal.

 RESULTS
Biophysics of FoxP-Positive and FoxP-Negative
Kenyon Cells
The single FoxP gene of Drosophila consists of six constitutively
and two alternatively spliced exons that give rise to a minimum of
two transcripts (RC and RD) and corresponding protein isoforms
(Santos et al., 2011) (Figure 1A). The two isoforms share an N-ter-
minal zinc finger domain but possess different C-terminal fork-
head domains. The transposable element insertion sites of
mutant FoxP alleles associated with reaction time phenotypes
(DasGupta et al., 2014), including FoxP5-SZ-3955, map to the
last, alternatively spliced exon and are therefore predicted to
disrupt the RC transcript (Figure 1A). To test this prediction, we
used NP7175-GAL4 or NP6024-GAL4 to drive moderate to
high levels of a GFP-tagged ribosomal protein (Heiman et al.,
2008; Huang et al., 2013) in abc KCs (Aso et al., 2009; Murthy
et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2004, 2008) (Figures S1A and S1B).
These neurons are also marked, albeit more weakly, by a FoxP
promoter fragment (DasGupta et al., 2014). Immunoprecipitation
of tagged ribosomes from head homogenate (translating
ribosome affinity purification or TRAP) (Heiman et al., 2008), fol-
lowed by reverse transcription of polysome-bound mRNA and
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), revealed an abundance
of FoxP-RC (but not FoxP-RD) transcript in abc neurons
(Figure 1B). FoxP-RC mRNA levels were greatly reduced in
homozygous
FoxP5-SZ-3955
mutants
and
flies
expressing
NP7175-GAL4-driven hairpin RNA directed against the FoxP
transcript (FoxPRNAi) (Figure 1B). a’b’ neurons, which lie outside
the FoxP-GAL4 expression domain (DasGupta et al., 2014) but
could be captured by the VT030604-GAL4 driver (Figure S1C),
contained only trace amounts of both FoxP isoforms, regardless
of genotype (Figure 1B). The mushroom body thus represents a
mosaic of FoxP-positive and FoxP-negative KCs, as suggested
by the expression pattern of FoxP-GAL4 (DasGupta et al., 2014).
For an initial determination of whether and how FoxP regulates
the function of neurons that express this transcription factor, we
targeted the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6m to FoxP-positive abc or
FoxP-negative a’b’ KCs and imaged Ca2+ transients evoked by
electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral antennal nerve (Figures
1C–1E and S2). Electrical instead of odor stimulation allowed
us to recruit many glomerular channels simultaneously and acti-
vate KCs broadly rather than in sparse odor-specific ensembles
whose membership varies unpredictably from fly to fly (Caron
et al., 2013; Gruntman and Turner, 2013; Murthy et al., 2008).
The dendritic and axonal compartments of both types of KC re-
sponded in a saturating fashion to stimulus trains of increasing
frequency, but the response amplitudes of FoxP-negative a’b’
cells increased more steeply and leveled off at lower stimulation
intensities than those of FoxP-positive abc KCs (Figures 1E and
1F). Mutating FoxP flattened the stimulus-response curves of
abc KCs and caused them to saturate at reduced plateaux (Fig-
ures 1E and 1F). Because the responses of a’b’ neurons were un-
affected in mutants (Figure 1F), the overall organization and

 strength of inputs from olfactory projection neurons, which are
thought to be shared among all classes of KC (Caron et al.,
2013; Gruntman and Turner, 2013), appear preserved. Changes
specific to the FoxP-positive abc KCs must therefore lie at the
root of the selective response attenuation of these cells.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vivo (Figure 2A) sup-
ported this conclusion. abc KCs of wild-type flies, homozygous
FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutants, and flies expressing FoxPRNAi under
NP7175-GAL4 control rested—the marginal hyperpolarization
of FoxP-deficient neurons notwithstanding—at broadly similar
membrane potentials (Figure 2B) and received synaptic inputs
at comparable basal rates (Figure S3A); these inputs gave rise
to the same average excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) at
a holding potential of –90 mV (Figures S3B–S3D). Regardless
of genotype, action potentials were initiated at similar voltages
during steps or ramps of depolarizing currents (Figures 2C–2F),
but the lower input resistances (Figure 2G) and shorter mem-
brane time constants (Figure 2H) of FoxP-deficient neurons
meant that larger currents were required to bring these cells to
threshold (Figures 2C and 2F). Because the necessary current
amplitudes were reached later during depolarizing ramps (Fig-
ure 2C), the spike latencies of FoxP-deficient neurons exceeded
those of wild-type cells (Figure 2E).
In contrast to the characteristic quiescence of abc KCs at
rest, many FoxP-negative a’b’ KCs (Figure 2J) were spontane-
ously active at similar membrane potential baselines (Figure 2K),
reflecting
their
lower
action
potential
thresholds
(Figures
2L–2O). a’b’ KCs had lower input resistances and shorter mem-
brane time constants than abc KCs (Figures 2O–2Q) and trans-
duced depolarizing current steps nearly linearly into propor-
tional spike rate increases (Figure 2R), whereas abc KCs
followed sigmoidal current-spike frequency functions (Figure 2I).
As would be expected for FoxP-negative neurons (Figure 1B),
none of the biophysical characteristics of a’b’ KCs were per-
turbed after interference with the expression of FoxP, be it
ubiquitously through mutation or in an a’b’ KC-restricted
manner
through
VT030604-GAL4-driven
FoxPRNAi
(Figures
2K–2R).
FoxP Represses Shal in abc KCs
The identical spike thresholds of wild-type and FoxP-deficient
abc KCs (Figure 2D) argue against a role of FoxP in regulating
voltage-gated sodium or calcium channels, which shape the
upstroke of the action potential. Subtle changes in the action
potential waveform during repolarization (Figure S3E) and the
prolonged latency to spiking during current ramps (Figures 2C
and 2E) instead hint at augmented potassium currents in FoxP-
deficient abc KCs. Voltage-clamp measurements and gene
expression analyses confirmed this notion. abc KCs expressed
a prominent voltage-dependent A-type potassium current (Fig-
ures 3A–3C) with half-activation and half-inactivation voltages
at steady state of –20.3 ± 1.6 mV and –72.9 ± 1.2 mV, respec-
tively (Figures 3C and 3D), and an inactivation time constant of
37.2 ± 2.4 ms at +50 mV (Figures S4A and S4B). The loss of
FoxP nearly doubled the membrane density of this current (Fig-
ures 3A–3C) while leaving unchanged its steady-state activation
and inactivation curves (Figure 3D). FoxP thus appears to control
the cell surface density of the pore-forming a subunit of a
voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel and not the level of an
accessory protein that influences the channel’s gating.
Quantitation of polysome-bound transcripts after cell-specific
TRAP (Heiman et al., 2008) identified the KV4 channel Shal (Butler
et al., 1989) as the sole FoxP target among the pore-forming sub-
units of 32 potassium, sodium, calcium, and chloride channels
encoded in the fly genome (Figure 4A). Shal’s gating parameters
(Gasque et al., 2005; Podlaski et al., 2017; Wei et al., 1990) and
sensitivity to phrixotoxin-2 (Gasque et al., 2005) and 150 mM
Ba2+ (Gasparini et al., 2007; Norris and Nerbonne, 2010)
matched, despite the distortions inherent in voltage-clamp mea-
surements from non-spherical cells (Rall and Segev, 1985),
those of the A-type current expressed by abc KCs (Figures
3D–3F and S4). Mutation of the FoxP locus or RNAi-mediated
depletion of FoxP elevated the amount of polysome-bound
Shal mRNA in abc KCs �10-fold; the levels of all other ion chan-
nel transcripts remained unaltered (Figure 4A). Global or
restricted interference with the function of FoxP had no signifi-
cant impact on ion channel gene expression in a’b’ KCs
(Figure 4B).
The channel repertoires of abc and a’b’ KCs were dominated
by different KV types. While Shal represented the most abundant
KV channel mRNA species in abc KCs (Figure S5A), Shaker and
Shaw predominated in a’b’ KCs (Figure S5B). Distinct mecha-
nisms thus operate in different KC classes to control the expres-
sion of Shal: in abc KCs, which contain both Shal and FoxP
(Figures 1B and S5A), the repressive action of FoxP limits the
dosage of Shal mRNA, whereas in a’b’ neurons, which express
little Shal and no FoxP (Figures 1B and S5B), a FoxP-indepen-
dent mechanism inhibits transcription of the Shal locus. As is
evident from the disparity between the increase in Shal transcript
levels (�10-fold; Figure 4A) and Shal currents (�2-fold; Figure 3B)
in FoxP-deficient abc KCs, an additional layer of post-transcrip-
tional control also exists.
FoxP, Shal, and Synaptic Integration
The somatodendritic location (Diao et al., 2010) (Figure 4C) and
hyperpolarized voltage operating range of Shal (Figure 3D)
suggest that the channel, like its mammalian ortholog KV4.2 in
hippocampal pyramidal cells (Cai et al., 2004; Hoffman et al.,
1997; Kim et al., 2005; Sheng et al., 1992), dampens dendritic
voltage deflections and thereby regulates the amplitude, time

 course, and propagation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials
(EPSPs). To test for a role of Shal (and, indirectly, of FoxP) in
synaptic integration, we recorded from abc and a’b’ KCs in vivo
while electrically stimulating 30 synaptic inputs from olfactory
projection neurons at different frequencies (Figures 5A, 5B, and
S6). The majority of evoked events (�80%) were unitary, as the
average synaptic current exceeded the average miniature
EPSC by 12%–25% (Figure S6). During stimulus trains, the mem-
brane potentials of abc KCs in wild-type flies climbed in a step-
wise fashion from resting potential to spike threshold, bridging
the average potential difference of 8.2 mV by integrating 4–30
synaptic quanta (Figures 5B and 5C). Inputs were summed
most efficiently when delivered at high frequencies (Figures 5C
and 5D), but even EPSPs spaced 50 or even 100 ms apart could
add up sufficiently to drive spiking (Figure 5B). By contrast, just
one or two EPSPs could close the narrow voltage gap between
the resting potentials and spike thresholds of a’b’ KCs, obviating
the need for extensive synaptic integration (Figures 5B–5D).
The EPSC amplitudes of FoxP-deficient and wild-type abc
KCs were identical when the cells were voltage-clamped
below the activation threshold of Shal (Figures S3B and
S3C). In current-clamp recordings near resting potential, how-
ever, spontaneous EPSPs in abc KCs of FoxP mutants were
smaller and decayed faster (Figures S3G–S3I), and evoked
EPSPs were dissipated more readily (Figure 5C), than those
in wild-type cells. As a consequence, opportunities for tempo-
ral summation of synaptic inputs were curtailed, and only high-
frequency stimulation could produce cumulative membrane
depolarizations that breached action potential threshold (Fig-
ures 5C and 5D). The addition of 150 mM Ba2+, which at this
concentration selectively blocks KV4 channels (Gasparini
et al., 2007; Norris and Nerbonne, 2010) (Figures 3E and 3F),
steepened the stimulus-response curves of wild-type and
FoxP-deficient
cells
to

degrees
(reflecting

different amounts of Shal expressed by these neurons) and
brought them into precise alignment (p = 0.9702, F test;

 Figure 5D): abc KCs of both wild-type and mutant flies now
required just a handful of synaptic impulses to emit action
potentials. The lack of a Ba2+ effect on a’b’ KCs, which
express high levels of Shaker and Shaw but little, if any, Shal
(Figure S5B), attests to the specificity of the pharmacological
block (Figures 5C and 5D).
FoxP, Shal, and Reaction Times
The ability to erase the biophysical difference between FoxP
genotypes simply by blocking Shal (Figures 5C and 5D) reaf-
firms that this ion channel is a crucial mediator of FoxP’s effects
on abc KCs. We therefore examined whether an analogous
manipulation could also correct the reaction time phenotype
of FoxP mutants. Flies were trained to avoid a specific concen-
tration of 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH) by pairing odor expo-
sures with electric foot shock. The animals then had to discrim-
inate the reinforced MCH concentration (20 ppm) from a lower
intensity (2–18 ppm) of the same odor (Figure 6A). The difficulty
of discrimination was adjusted by varying the MCH concentra-
tion ratio during testing. Control flies make rapid, accurate
decisions in easy discriminations (concentration ratio 0.1) and
slow, error-prone choices in difficult tasks (concentration ratio
0.9) (DasGupta et al., 2014). Homozygous carriage of the
FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutation exacted a steeper difficulty-dependent
cost of decision time (DasGupta et al., 2014), but the chrono-
metric function was restored to its wild-type shape when
FoxP mutants expressed a transgene (UAS-DN-Shal) encoding
a dominant-negative Shal subunit (Ping et al., 2011) selectively
in abc KCs (Figure 6B). The temperature-inducible overexpres-

KCs (Figure 6D), of wild-type flies had
the opposite effect; it recapitulated the
FoxP mutant phenotype. Bidirectional
tuning of Shal currents in abc KCs thus
produced a spectrum of wild-type and
mutant reaction times, independently of
the genotype of the FoxP locus (Figures
6B and 6C). These data establish abc
KCs as the decision-relevant site, and
repression of Shal as the decision-relevant mechanism, of
FoxP’s action.
Neurometric Functions Based on First Spikes
The membrane potential responses of abc KCs to changes in
odor concentration, intended to emulate a fly’s experience of
the decision zone in a behavioral chamber (Claridge-Chang
et al., 2009; DasGupta et al., 2014), offer a bridge between
biophysics and behavior (Figure 7). A continuous stream of
MCH was stepped repeatedly between base (2–18 ppm, variable
between trials) and peak concentrations (20 ppm, constant
across trials) (Figures 7A–7D), recreating the exact range of
odor intensities and intensity contrasts encountered during
behavioral testing (Figure 6). The 500-ms intervals between
odor intensity changes (Figures 7B–7D) approximated the times
flies spend on one side of the decision zone (Claridge-Chang
et al., 2009; DasGupta et al., 2014), whereas periodic stimulation
mimicked their back-and-forth movements and allowed us to
quantify abc KC responses to concentration steps in the
preferred and null directions (see below), a prerequisite for neu-
rometric estimates of accuracy (Britten et al., 1992).
Current-clamp recordings during blocks of ten stimulation
cycles revealed three functional classes of abc KC: neurons
responding to increases or decreases in MCH concentration
(‘‘up’’ and ‘‘down’’ cells) and unresponsive neurons (Ito et al.,
2008) (Figures 7B and S7A). Decisions could thus be based on
comparisons of activity in two opponent pools of abc KCs repre-
senting evidence for the alternative choices, an arrangement
reminiscent of the hypothetical ‘‘neuron-antineuron’’ configura-
tion in visual motion discrimination (Britten et al., 1992). Because
Cell 173, 894–905, May 3, 2018
899
 we found twice as many up as down abc KCs (Figure 7B), our
subsequent analyses concentrated on them.
In contrast to a’b’ KCs (Figures 7C and 7D), abc KCs showed
virtually no background spiking activity, regardless of base MCH
concentration, and instead responded to concentration changes
(Figures 7B, 7D, and S7). In wild-type flies, large fractional in-
creases in odor intensity (from 2 to 20 ppm MCH, a concentration
ratio of 0.1) evoked action potentials with short latencies
(< 300 ms) that were preceded by steep membrane depolariza-
tions (Figures 7F and 7G) and tended to repeat during the correct
phase of many, if not all, successive odor concentration cycles in
a block (Figure 7D). Reducing the intensity contrast (by elevating
the MCH base) produced shallower, meandering voltage
changes (Figures 7F and 7G) that eroded the close temporal
coupling between stimulus and spiking response until, at a con-
centration ratio of 0.9, a median of three stimulation cycles were
needed to unlock the first spike (Figure 7D). This up cell spike
now often occurred during the incorrect—that is, downward—
phase of the concentration cycle (Figures 7D and S7B). Neuronal
sensitivity and selectivity, quantified as the timing and fidelity of
the first odor-evoked spike, thus declined with diminishing odor
contrast. The decline in sensitivity was precipitous in FoxP-defi-
cient abc KCs, which suffered excessive spike delays (Figure 7D)
or response failures (Figure 7B) that likely reflect the synaptic
integration defect exposed during electrical stimulation of the
antennal nerve (Figures 5C and 5D).
Altogether, the changes in abc KC responses as a function of
stimulus contrast, and the influence of FoxP on them, parallel
changes in the speed and accuracy of the decision-making
animal in perceptual tasks of varying difficulty. To make this
notion rigorous, we compared the psycho- and chronometric
functions measured behaviorally (DasGupta et al., 2014) with
neurometric counterparts constructed from the separately re-
corded abc KC responses. Because the temporal structure of
the odor stimulus used to elicit these responses was an imper-
fect match to the many possible sequences of odor concentra-
tion changes experienced by flies sampling the decision zone
(Claridge-Chang et al., 2009; DasGupta et al., 2014) (Figure 6),
we verified that the exact stimulus waveform had no significant
influence on the average spike latency of abc KCs (Figures
S7C–S7E). The conclusions that follow are therefore robust.
Behavioral performance is well described (DasGupta et al.,
2014) by a drift-diffusion model with three free parameters
(Bogacz et al., 2006; Ratcliff, 1978; Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008)
(Figure 7H). The model splits the reaction time into two additive
components: a difficulty- and genotype-dependent decision
time and a constant residual time, which is taken up by pro-
cesses unrelated to the decision itself (Bogacz et al., 2006;
Ratcliff, 1978; Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008). In our assay, the lion’s
share of the estimated residual time of 1.296 s is spent on
locomotion: a fly walking at a measured mean velocity of
2.98 ± 0.08 mm/s in the direction of the long chamber axis will
need 1.356 s to travel the average distance of 2.02 ± 0.02 mm
from the edge of the decision zone to the empirically determined
turning point and back (means ± SEM, n = 775 decisions). After
stripping away this behaviorally constrained residual time from
the measured reaction times, the mean latency of the first abc
KC spike predicted the pure decision times of both genotypes

 at all difficulty levels (Figure 7I). Similarly good fits to the empir-
ical decision accuracies (which are identical for wild-type and
FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutant flies) were obtained by tallying the percent-
ages of first spikes released after odor concentration steps in the
preferred or null directions (Figure 7I).
The fact that the psychometric functions of wild-type and
FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutant flies overlapped while their chronometric
functions differed (Figure 7I) places an additional constraint on
putative neural mechanisms of sequential sampling. In the
drift-diffusion framework (Bogacz et al., 2006; Ratcliff, 1978;
Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008), any change that slows the sensory
evidence-driven drift of a decision variable toward threshold
will not only extend the average reaction time but simultaneously
reduce accuracy, due to the relatively augmented influence of
diffusion noise s2. When the decision criterion is fixed, as is
the spike threshold of wild-type and mutant abc KCs relative to
resting potential (Figures 2B and 2D), maintaining constant accu-
racy despite lower drift rate v requires a commensurate reduc-
tion in noise, keeping v/s2 constant (Figure 7H). Such a compen-
satory change was evident in the subthreshold membrane
potential fluctuations of FoxP-deficient abc KCs (Figures 7D,
7F, and 7J). Because KV4 channels act like shock absorbers
that limit large, rapid voltage changes (Cai et al., 2004; Hoffman
et al., 1997), their abundance in mutants reduced the average
membrane potential variance (s2) to 0.5242 times that of wild-
type cells (Figure 7J). Estimates, from reaction time data
(DasGupta et al., 2014), of the drift rates (v) of homozygous
FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutant and wild-type flies yielded a virtually
identical ratio of 0.5296, ensuring the required constancy of
v/s2 across genotypes.
DISCUSSION
Searches for the mechanisms that allow neurons to accumulate
information during decision-making, compare the accumulated
signal to a response criterion, and release behavior when the
criterion is met have almost exclusively centered on suprathres-
hold dynamics, which are visible to extracellular electrodes or
Ca2+ reporters (Hanes and Schall, 1996; Harvey et al., 2012;
Latimer et al., 2015; Roitman and Shadlen, 2002; Shadlen and
Newsome, 2001). In the prevalent view, ramp-like changes in
mean firing rate represent accumulating evidence in the lead-
up to a choice (Gold and Shadlen, 2007; Shadlen and Kiani,
2013). Our findings suggest that abc KCs integrate subthreshold
depolarizations evoked by sequentially arriving quanta of sen-
sory information, and that the ability to execute this integration
operation dictates behavioral performance. In contrast to ramp-
ing (Hanes and Schall, 1996; Roitman and Shadlen, 2002; Shad-
len and Newsome, 2001), stepping (Latimer et al., 2015), or high-
dimensional (Harvey et al., 2012) patterns of spiking activity,
which must be decoded by still unspecified thresholding mech-
anisms, synaptic integration reaches a natural endpoint: the
discharge of an action potential. It can therefore provide all
computational elements needed to map a process of bounded
evidence accumulation onto a neuronal medium.
While the ability to combine synaptic inputs is, of course, com-
mon to all neurons, abc KCs appear to tailor, through a particular
constellation of biophysical properties, this generic process to
the demands of sequential sampling. A large voltage difference
(equal to the linear sum of six or seven coincident EPSPs) sepa-
rates resting potential and spike threshold (Figures 2B, 2D, and

 S3H); this makes action potentials infrequent and, when they
occur, contingent on the summation of multiple sensory inputs
(Figures 5C and 7D–7F). A long membrane time constant (Fig-
ure 2H) provides accumulator memory (Figures 5B and 5C),
whereas Shal currents may improve accuracy by reducing noise
(Figure 7J) and discounting sporadic sensory events (Figures 5C
and 5D).
The accord between the behaviorally inferred noise in the
decision variable (Figure 7H) and the measured voltage noise
of abc KCs (Figure 7J) indicates that the membrane potential of
these neurons encodes a quantity closely related to a decision
variable. Consistent with this view, decisions take the same
average time to form as the membrane potential does to reach
spike threshold (Figure 7I), and manipulations that advance or
delay the first abc KC spike have corresponding consequences
for reaction times (Figures 6B and 6C). Although the average
latency of the first abc KC spike can account for the average
decision time, this agreement alone cannot establish that abc
KC are the only integrators along the sensorimotor pathway:
the argument naturally hinges on correct decision time estimates
by our drift-diffusion model and could be strengthened by ex-
tending the analysis from statistical averages to individual trials.
However, this will require new methods for measuring and per-
turbing the membrane potential while decisions are being made.
The existence of up and down cells (Figures 7B and S7A) sug-
gests that a decision entails a race between two integrators, one
that accumulates evidence for an increase in odor concentration
and another that does the opposite (Shadlen and Kiani, 2013). It
is reasonable to assume (though difficult at present to prove) that
the winner of the race informs the animal’s choice by activating
inherently valued mushroom body output neurons (MBONs)
(Aso et al., 2014b). KC-to-MBON synapses depress (Hige
et al., 2015; Se
´ journe
´ et al., 2011) when odor-driven KC and
MBON activity coincides with local dopaminergic reinforcement
(Aso et al., 2014a; Burke et al., 2012; Claridge-Chang et al., 2009;
Liu et al., 2012; Schwaerzel et al., 2003). Because MBONs and
reinforcing dopaminergic neurons are twinned in sign-reversed
pairs (MBONs directing attraction with aversively reinforcing
dopaminergic neurons and vice versa) (Aso et al., 2014a,
2014b), synaptic depression will differentially weaken the con-
nections of the opponent abc KC pools with MBONs of opposite
valence. In our training regime, the expected net effect of these
changes is that activity in up and down cells elicits learned avoid-
ance and approach, respectively. Correct and erroneous
choices follow logically from this model: if up cells spike before
down cells after an increase in odor intensity, a correct reversal
will result; if down cells spike before up cells, an incorrect
approach to the negatively reinforced odor will be made.
Competition between these ‘‘neuron-antineuron’’ pools (Britten
et al., 1992) or the MBONs sampling them could be enhanced
by feedforward or recurrent inhibition mediated by GABAergic
or glutamatergic MBONs interconnecting mushroom body com-
partments (Aso et al., 2014a), or by the GABAergic anterior
paired lateral neuron (Lin et al., 2014; Papadopoulou et al.,
2011). These circuit architectures are similar in essence (Bogacz
et al., 2006) to connectionist (Shadlen and Newsome, 2001;
Shadlen and Kiani, 2013; Usher and McClelland, 2001) or
reduced network models (Wang, 2002) of spike-based integra-
tion, but with the important difference that subthreshold rather
than suprathreshold processes are responsible for a rate-limiting
integration step.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Experimental flies were heterozygous for all transgenes, including UAS-FoxPRNAi (Vienna Drosophila Recource Centre [VDRC] ID
15732; Dietzl et al., 2007), and homozygous for either a wild-type (WT) or the mutant FoxP5-SZ-3955 allele (w1118; P{RS5}FoxP5-SZ-3955,
Kyoto Stock Center), as indicated. For translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and patch-clamp recordings, NP7175-GAL4
(Aso et al., 2009; Murthy et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2004; 2008) or VT030604-GAL4 (Kvon et al., 2014) (VDRC ID 200228) were used to
target the expression of UAS-EGFP-L10a (Huang et al., 2013) or UAS-CD8::GFP (Lee and Luo, 1999) to abc or a’b’ KCs, respectively
(Figure S1). In functional imaging experiments, where the a’ lobe of the mushroom body could be visually identified, KC populations
expressed UAS-GCaMP6m (Chen et al., 2013) under the control of OK107-GAL4 (Tanaka et al., 2008) or NP7175-GAL4 (Figures S1
and S2). To examine the subcellular distribution of Shal or the behavioral consequences of altered Shal currents, the strong NP6024-
GAL4 line (Tanaka et al., 2008) was used to drive high-level expression of UAS-GFP-Shal (Diao et al., 2010) or UAS-DN-Shal (Ping
et al., 2011) in abc KCs. In Figure 4C, abc KCs coexpressed UAS-mCherry-CAAX (Kakihara et al., 2008); in Figures 6C and 6D, flies
bearing UAS-GFP-Shal also carried tubP-GAL80ts (McGuire et al., 2003) to enable the temperature-controlled overexpression
of Shal.
Fly strains were cultivated on standard cornmeal agar under a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle at 25�C unless they expressed GAL80ts; in
this case, the experimental animals and all relevant controls were raised at 18�C.

 METHOD DETAILS
Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification
For each biological replicate, the heads of 400 male and female flies expressing UAS-EGFP-L10a (Huang et al., 2013) in the KC
population of interest were collected at 7–8 days post-eclosion and homogenized in 500 ml of extraction buffer (pH 7.3) containing
20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 mg/ml cycloheximide, 100 U/ml
RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), and 1 3 cOmplete Protease Inhibitor (Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 min at 4�C,
and the supernatants were applied to 25 ml Protein G Mag Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) coated with monoclonal mouse
anti-GFP antibody (Htz-GFP-19C8, Memorial Sloan Kettering Monoclonal Antibody Facility). After incubation for 1 h at 4�C, unbound
material was collected, and the beads were washed 5 times with 500 ml each of buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM
KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 40 U/ml RNaseOUT.
Reverse Transcription and Quantitative Real-time PCR
RNA was isolated from immunoprecipitated ribosomes and unbound material using the PicoPURE RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technol-
ogies); 10–15 ng of RNA were then reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen). cDNA was
pre-amplified by multiplex PCR using primers specific for three housekeeping genes (Gpdh, Tbp, and Ef1a100E); GFP, Fas2, or trio
as markers for ab or a’b’ KCs (Awasaki et al., 2000; Grenningloh et al., 1991), respectively; and the FoxP isoforms and ion channel
genes of interest (Table S5). Transcript levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR on a LightCycler 480 system (Roche)
using SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche) in 10 ml reactions containing 100 nM of each gene-specific primer and 50 ng of pre-amplified
cDNA. All samples were run in technical triplicates; non-reverse-transcribed mRNA and water served as negative controls. Melting
curves were analyzed after amplification, and amplicons were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm primer specificity.
Relative transcript levels were estimated with the help of the 2-DDCt method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001), using the geometric mean
of the Ct values of the three housekeeping genes for normalization.
Functional Imaging
Male flies aged 7 days were fixed to a custom mount with soft thermoplastic wax (Agar Scientific). Cuticle, adipose tissue, and
trachea were surgically removed in a window large enough to expose the dorsal brain and antennal nerves, and the preparation
was superfused with extracellular solution (pH 7.45) containing 5 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 4.5 mM MgCl2, and
1.5 mM CaCl2. Both antennal nerves were cut as far distally as possible, and the antennae were removed to facilitate access.
One nerve was aspirated into a fire-polished suction electrode (40 mm bore diameter) to achieve a 1.5 ± 0.3 MU seal. A constant
voltage stimulator (Digitimer) was used to deliver trains of 1 ms pulses of 2 V at increasing frequencies for 500 ms, with pauses of
20 s between stimulus trains. The pipette resistance was monitored throughout to guarantee constant stimulation currents.
GCaMP6m fluorescence was recorded by two-photon laser scanning microscopy. Excitation light pulses with 140 fs duration and
a center wavelength of 910 nm (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) were intensity-modulated with the help of a Pockels cell (302RM,
Conoptics) and focused by a 20 3, 1.0 NA water immersion objective (W-Plan-Apochromat, Zeiss) on a Movable Objective Micro-
scope (Sutter Instruments). Emitted photons were separated from excitation light by a series of dichromatic mirrors and dielectric and
colored glass filters and detected by a GaAsP photomultiplier tube (H10770PA-40 SEL, Hamamatsu Photonics). Photocurrents were
passed through a high-speed amplifier (HCA-4M-500K-C, Laser Components) and a custom-designed integrator circuit to maximize
the signal-to-noise ratio (Shang et al., 2007). The microscope was controlled through ScanImage (Vidrio Technologies) via a PCI-
6110 DAQ board (National Instruments). Images were acquired at a resolution of 256 3 256 pixels and a frame rate of 5 Hz. All ex-
periments were carried out at room temperature (21–23�C).
DF/F traces in manually defined regions of interest were calculated in ImageJ by dividing the background-corrected fluorescence
by the background-corrected pre-stimulus signal (Lin et al., 2014). To measure the maximal GCaMP6m fluorescence, Ca2+ influx was
induced at the end of each experiment by rapidly applying KCl to the bath at a final concentration of 100 mM (Figure S2).
Structural Imaging
Brains of male flies were dissected 2 days after eclosion and mounted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl,
8 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3) for imaging native fluorescence (Figure 4C). For immunostaining (Figures 2A, 2J, and S1),
dissected brains were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed four times for 20 min in
PBS, and permeabilized and blocked in PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5% (v/v) goat serum for 1 h. To label synaptic
structures, the samples were first incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-discs large antibody 4F3 (Developmental Studies Hybrid-
oma Bank, University of Iowa, 1:50) and then with Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (A-21052, Invitrogen, 1:200). Each
incubation lasted for 48 h at 4�C and was followed by four 20 min washes in PBS. Stained samples were mounted in Vectashield
(Vector Labs) and imaged on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope equipped with an HCX PL APO 40 3, 1.3 CS oil immersion objec-
tive (Leica). Images were processed in ImageJ.

 Electrophysiology
For whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vivo, male flies aged 6–24 h post-eclosion were prepared as for functional imaging, but the
perineural sheath was also removed to provide access to KC somata while the antennae and antennal nerves were left intact for
eliciting odor responses. The brain was continuously superfused with extracellular solution (pH 7.3) containing 5 mM TES,
103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 8 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, and
7 mM sucrose (275 mOsM, equilibrated with 5% CO2 and 95% O2). Patch pipettes (15–17 MU) were fabricated from borosilicate
glass capillaries with outer and inner diameters of 1.5 and 0.86 mm (Sutter Instruments), using a PC-10 micropipette puller
(Narishige), and filled with solution (pH 7.3) containing 10 mM HEPES, 140 mM potassium aspartate, 1 mM KCl, 4 mM MgATP,
0.5 mM Na3GTP, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM biocytin (265 mOsM). Pipettes were visually targeted to green-fluorescent KC somata
using a combination of epifluorescence and differential interference contrast on an Axioskop 2 FS mot microscope (Zeiss) equipped
with a 60 3, 1.0 NA water-immersion objective (LUMPLFLN60XW, Olympus) and an X-Cite 120PC Q light source (Excelitas Technol-
ogies). abc KCs labeled by NP7175-GAL4 were considered a homogeneous population and sampled randomly, regardless of their
discernible origin from one of the four neuroblast clones that give rise to the mushroom bodies (Ito et al., 1997; Tanaka et al., 2008)
(Figure 2A). Estimates of the number of abc KCs captured by NP7175-GAL4 range from 58 (Tanaka et al., 2004) to 92 (Murthy et al.,
2008) to 203 cells per hemisphere (Aso et al., 2009) and thus agree with our estimate of �80 FoxP-positive abc KCs per hemisphere to
differing degrees (DasGupta et al., 2014). Should the high estimate prove accurate, the population of abc KCs we characterized may
include FoxP-negative cells.
Signals were acquired at room temperature (21–23�C) with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), lowpass-filtered at
10 kHz, and sampled at 50 kHz using a Digidata 1440A digitizer controlled through pCLAMP 10 (Molecular Devices). Data were
corrected for liquid junction potential (Neher, 1992) and analyzed with custom procedures, using the NeuroMatic package (http://
neuromatic.thinkrandom.com) in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics).
In current-clamp recordings, bridge balance was used to compensate for series resistance. The most negative membrane poten-
tial recorded immediately after break-in, in the absence of a holding current and without correcting for errors introduced through seal
conductances, was taken to represent the resting potential. Because of the high input resistances of KCs (Turner et al., 2008) (Figures
2G and 2P), the true resting potentials are likely to be more hyperpolarized (Gouwens and Wilson, 2009). Only cells with a measured
resting potential below –35 mV and a spiking response to depolarizing current injections were characterized further. Spikes were
detected by finding minima in the time derivative of the membrane potential trace, which allowed the distinction of action potentials
from EPSPs on the basis of differences in the slopes of membrane repolarization. Spike thresholds and spike latencies were
estimated by recording voltage responses to 600 ms current ramps, from –2 to +20 pA, starting at a membrane potential of
–75 ± 2 mV. Input resistances were calculated from linear fits of the steady-state voltage changes elicited by 750 ms steps of hyper-
polarizing currents (1 pA increments, starting at –4 pA) from a pre-pulse potential of –70 ± 5 mV. Membrane time constants were
determined by fitting a single exponential to the voltage deflection caused by a hyperpolarizing 2.5 pA current step lasting
750 ms. Action potential waveforms represent averages of individual, baseline-subtracted spikes recorded at membrane potentials
just above threshold, when neurons fired at % 5 Hz; EPSP waveforms represent averages of individual, baseline-subtracted EPSPs
occurring spontaneously at a membrane potential of –70 ± 5 mV. Decay time constants were determined by fitting single exponentials
to the averaged EPSP waveforms.
For electrical stimulation of the antennal nerve, both antennal nerves were cut as far distally as possible. One nerve was aspirated
into a fire-polished suction electrode (40 mm bore diameter) to achieve a 1.5 ± 0.3 MU seal. The amplitude of 50 ms voltage pulses
delivered by a constant voltage stimulator (Digitimer) was gradually increased until EPSCs or EPSPs could be detected in the
recorded KC; the stimulus intensity was then further increased by �25% to minimize the fraction of transmission failures. Once a
stable response was obtained, the stimulus intensity was left unchanged for the remainder of the experiment. The coefficient of vari-
ation (CV) of EPSC amplitudes within a trial was 0.440 ± 0.019 (mean ± SEM, n = 22 trials), comparable to that attributed to quantal
variability at individual excitatory synapses (McAllister and Stevens, 2000). Consistent with this interpretation, the variation of mean
evoked EPSC amplitudes between trials was smaller than the variation within trials (CV = 0.134 ± 0.014; mean ± SEM, n = 3 cells).
Following a first set of stimulation trials at a range of frequencies, BaCl2 was added to the extracellular solution at a final concen-
tration of 150 mM, and a second set of stimulation trials was conducted; the ability of 150 mM Ba2+ to block Shal currents was verified
in voltage-clamp recordings (Figures 3E and 3F). In some experiments, a third and final set of antennal nerve stimulation trials was
performed after the addition of 1 mM tetrodotoxin (TTX, Tocris) to block voltage-gated Na+ channels and ensure that the responses of
the recorded KC were synaptically mediated.
For olfactory stimulation (Shang et al., 2007), mass flow-controlled streams of MCH-infused air (CMOSens, Sensirion) were
directed at the fly’s head through a behavioral chamber cut in half; flow rates matched those in behavioral experiments
(0.25 l/min). Solenoid valves (The Lee Company) under LabVIEW control (National Instruments) switched between odor streams
containing basal (2–18 ppm) and peak (20 ppm) MCH concentrations. Steady-state odor concentrations were calibrated using a
ppbRAE 3000 photoionization detector (RAE systems); the kinetics of MCH concentration changes at the position of the fly were
recorded with a 200B miniPID (Aurora Scientific) at 10 kHz and smoothed with a Gaussian filter. Pressure changes caused by the
opening and closing of valves were balanced with the help of a set of pressure-compensating valves and monitored periodically
with a mass flow sensor (FBAL001DU, Sensor Technics). The membrane potential at the beginning of each MCH stimulation trial
was –50 ± 5 mV. KCs were classified according to their spiking responses to a high-contrast stimulus (MCH concentration ratio

 0.1) (Figure 7B). Up cells fired spikes during the rising phase of the stimulus; down cells responded during the falling phase; unre-
sponsive cells did not show a spiking response to MCH concentration changes in either direction. Membrane potential variances
as functions of base MCH concentration were quantified in the 5 s window immediately before stimulus onset.
Voltage-clamp recordings, except those in Figures 3E, 3F, 5B, and S3A–S3D, were obtained in the presence of 1 mM TTX; because
KCs lack significant Ca2+ currents (Gasque et al., 2005), no measures were taken to block Ca2+ channels. Series resistances were
monitored but not compensated and allowed to rise by at most 20% during the course of a recording. Capacitative transients and
linear leak currents were subtracted using a P/4 protocol. Steady-state activation parameters were determined by applying depola-
rizing 50 ms voltage pulses from a holding potential of –100 mV; the pulses covered the range to +50 mV in steps of 10 mV. A-type
current densities were determined by dividing the peak outward current during the first 10 ms of the test pulse by the cell’s capac-
itance after digitally subtracting non-inactivating outward currents. Membrane capacitances were estimated by integrating the
capacitative currents produced by 10 ms steps of 20 mV and found to be identical among genotypes (p = 0.3127, Kruskal-Wallis
test), averaging 2.41 ± 0.07 pF (n = 81 cells), 2.45 ± 0.07 pF (n = 49 cells), and 2.49 ± 0.06 pF (n = 42 cells) for abc KCs of wild-
type, FoxP5-SZ-3955, and FoxPRNAi flies, respectively (means ± SEM). Steady-state inactivation parameters were obtained with the
help of a two-pulse protocol, in which a 500 ms pre-pulse (–120 to –30 mV in 5 mV increments) was followed by a 50 ms test pulse
to +50 mV; non-inactivating outward currents, measured from a pre-pulse potential of –30 mV, were subtracted. Peak A-type cur-
rents (IA) were normalized to the maximum current amplitude (Imax) of the respective cell and plotted against the pre-pulse potential
(V). Curves were fit to the Boltzmann function IA=Imax = 1=ð1 + eðV�V0:5Þ=kÞ to determine the half-maximal inactivation voltage (V0.5) and
slope factor (k). To estimate the inactivation time constant, single exponential functions were fit to the decaying phase of currents
elicited by 100 ms depolarizing voltage pulses after digitally subtracting non-inactivating outward currents. Phrixotoxin-2 (Alomone
Labs) was dissolved freshly in extracellular solution at 100 mM and applied directly to the soma of the recorded cell, using a patch
pipette (3–4 MU) connected to a pneumatic drug ejection system (5 psi, PEDS-02DX, npi electronic).
Measurement of Reaction Times and Decision Accuracies
Male flies aged 7–8 days were analyzed individually in transparent plexiglass chambers (50 mm long, 5 mm wide, 1.3 mm high) (Clar-
idge-Chang et al., 2009; DasGupta et al., 2014). Two independently controlled odor streams entered the chambers through ports at
the ends of the long chamber axis, converged at the center, and left through lateral vents (Figure 6A). Printed circuit boards, con-
nected via solid-state relays (Fairchild HSR312L) to a 70 V power supply, served as floors and ceilings. Filtered, flow-controlled
(CMOSens, Sensirion), and humidified carrier air was mixed, in the indicated ratios, with flow-controlled odor streams drawn through
vials containing MCH, yielding a final flow rate of 0.25 l/min per half-chamber. Twenty chambers were operated simultaneously in an
incubator (Sanyo MIR-154) at 25�C. The chambers were backlit by 940 nm LEDs (TSAL6100, Vishay) and imaged using a Stingray
F080B CCD camera (Allied Vision Technologies) with an 18 mm lens (Edmund Scientific). A virtual instrument written in LabVIEW
(National Instruments) controlled the delivery of odors and electric shock and recorded the positions of the 20 flies as functions of
time (Claridge-Chang et al., 2009).
Flies were trained to avoid 20 ppm MCH by pairing twelve consecutive odor presentations with electric shock (DasGupta et al.,
2014). During a 2 min testing period immediately after training, one half of each chamber was filled with MCH at the reinforced con-
centration while the other half was perfused with a lower concentration; the concentration ratio was titrated to determine the difficulty
of the perceptual task (DasGupta et al., 2014).
Experimental data were processed offline in MATLAB (The MathWorks) (DasGupta et al., 2014). Position measurements were
smoothed by computing 0.5 s moving averages and filtered to exclude animals making < 2 end-to-center runs per testing period.
Each chamber contained a central, 7 mm wide decision zone (Figure 6A). Correct and incorrect choices during the test period
were combined into individual accuracy scores, which were used to calculate population averages. The time between entry into
and exit from the decision zone was recorded as the reaction time (DasGupta et al., 2014). A fly’s trajectory within the decision
zone, viewed along the long chamber axis (Figures 6B–6D), typically consisted of an entry phase at high velocity, a pause at the
odor interface, and an accelerating exit phase. Reaction times were normalized to each fly’s instantaneous walking speed, estimated
as the average speed from the point of entry into the decision zone to the first reduction to 10% of the entry velocity (DasGupta et al.,
2014). In Figures 6C and 6D, all flies were kept at 31�C for 40–48 h before the experiment to allow the temperature-induced over-
expression of Shal.
Drift-diffusion Model
Accuracy and reaction time measurements (DasGupta et al., 2014) were fit to a drift-diffusion model (Bogacz et al., 2006). The model
assumes that the difference in evidence favoring one alternative over the other evolves as a result of drift vdt and Gaussian diffusion
noise with zero mean and variance s2dt until one of two symmetrical decision criteria (a.k.a. bounds) located at ± A is reached.
Genotype-specific scaling factors ki relate the drift rates vi,x linearly to the difficulty x of odor intensity discrimination, which we
quantified as (1–odor concentration ratio): vi,x = ki x. Solving the first-passage problem for the decision variable yields analytical
expressions (Bogacz et al., 2006) that link the observed accuracies (fractions of correct choices Fi,x, normalized by the empirically

In order for accuracy to become independent of genotype (that is, independent of the genotype-specific parameters ki and si

observed in Figure 7I (DasGupta et al., 2014), the noise variances si
2 must be proportional to the corresponding scaling factors: ki = c

The new parameters A’ and k’i absorb the proportionality constant c: A’ = c A and k’i = c ki. The free parameters A’, k’WT, k’FoxP, and T0
were estimated from a simultaneous least-squares fit, computed with the help of the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm implemented in
MATLAB, of accuracy and reaction time data of wild-type and FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutant flies (DasGupta et al., 2014) to Equations (3) and
(4). The model returned a residual time T0 of 1.296 s, a bound height A’ of 4.383, and genotype-specific scaling factors k’i of 12.659 for
wild-type and 6.704 for FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutant flies. The units of A’ and k’i are arbitrary.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Data were analyzed in Prism 6 (GraphPad). Group means were compared by one- or two-way ANOVA, using repeated-measures
designs where appropriate, followed by post hoc analyses using Holm–�

of normality or equality of variances were violated (as indicated by Shapiro–Wilk and Brown–Forsythe tests, respectively), group
means were compared using two-sided Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. Reaction time distribu-
tions were compared by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, using the Bonferroni correction to adjust the level of statistical significance;
stimulus-response and current-spike frequency curves were analyzed by F test.
