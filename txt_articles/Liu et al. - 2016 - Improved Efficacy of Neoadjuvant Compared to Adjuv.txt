ABSTRACT 
 
Immunotherapy has recently entered a renaissance phase with the approval of 
multiple agents for the treatment of cancer. Immunotherapy stands ready to join 
traditional modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapy, as a pillar 
of cancer treatment. Although immunotherapy has begun to have success in advanced cancer treat-
ment, its scheduling and effi
 cacy with surgery to treat earlier stages of cancer and prevent distant 
metastases have not been systematically examined. Here, we have used two models of spontaneously 
metastatic breast cancers in mice to illustrate the signifi
 cantly greater therapeutic power of neoadju-
vant, compared with adjuvant, immunotherapies in the context of primary tumor resection. Elevated 
and sustained peripheral tumor-specifi
 c immune responses underpinned the outcome, and blood 
sampling of tumor-specifi
 c CD8 
+ T cells immediately prior to and post surgery may provide a predictor 
of outcome. These data now provide a strong rationale to extensively test and compare neoadjuvant 
immunotherapy in humans.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Cancer surgery remains the most effective single modal-
ity for curing patients if staging reveals that the tumor 
can be removed by local resection ( 
1 
). Unfortunately, only 
half of all patients with cancer undergo surgery with cura-
tive intent, with most relapsing from metastases. Thus, the 
standard schedule of cancer therapy for patients generally 
involves surgery followed by adjuvant therapies. Cancer 
immunotherapies that target the T-cell checkpoint recep-
tors cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA4) 
and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell 
death 1 ligand (PD-L1) are revolutionary new therapies able 
to cause long-term tumor regression and potential cures in 
advanced cancers ( 
2 
). These therapies are predicted to be used 
to treat a large proportion of patients with advanced cancers 
over the next 10 years and most likely will be used in patients 
at earlier stages of disease, where surgery is potentially cura-
tive but sometimes fails due to occult distant metastases ( 
3 
). 
Thus, how to best combine immunotherapies with surgery to 
reduce disease recurrence is a very meaningful question for 
the treatment of resectable tumors. 
 
Neoadjuvant therapy refers to the systemic treatment of 
cancer prior to defi
 nitive surgical therapy (i.e., preoperative 
therapy). The primary objective of neoadjuvant therapy is to 
improve surgical outcomes in patients for whom a primary 
surgical approach is technically not feasible. Furthermore, 
systemic therapy administered to patients with nonmetastatic 
invasive cancer (e.g., of the breast) is also intended to reduce 
the risk of distant recurrence, because metastatic disease post 
surgery kills a signifi
 cant proportion of patients with cancer. 
Although it was hypothesized that overall survival would 
be improved with earlier initiation of systemic therapy in 
patients with breast cancer at risk of distant recurrence, clini-
cal studies have not yet demonstrated a survival benefi
 t for 
preoperative versus postoperative delivery of systemic therapy 
such as chemotherapy ( 
4–6 
). Although anti-CTLA4 and anti–
PD-1/PD-L1 are FDA approved for the treatment of advanced 
metastatic malignancies, including melanoma, non–small cell 
lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC; refs. 
 
7–11 
), their effi
 cacy in adjuvant settings is currently being 
evaluated. The effi
 cacy of adjuvant anti-CTLA4 has been stud-
ied in a randomized phase III trial where it was compared with 
placebo (EORTC 18071; ref.  
12 
), and a relapse-free survival 
advantage was seen compared with placebo in patients with 
resected stage III cutaneous melanomas, although overall 
survival data are not yet mature ( 
13 
). Given its favorable 
therapeutic index, the effi
 cacy of adjuvant anti–PD-1 is also

being assessed in a number of clinical trials ( 
13 
). In one study, 
adjuvant anti–PD-1 plus vaccine in patients with resected 
stage IIIC and IV melanoma reported encouraging relapse-free 
survival data ( 
14 
). Clinically, there have been studies report-
ing that neoadjuvant therapies including chemotherapies, 
targeted therapies, and immunotherapy (ipilimumab) given 
as a neoadjuvant could improve outcome in the management 
of patients with multiple different solid tumors ( 
15–18 
). How-
ever, whether immunotherapies will be more effi
 cacious when 
given in a neoadjuvant setting compared with an adjuvant set-
ting is unknown; a head-to-head comparison study has only 
now just opened (NCT02519322). 
 
Theoretically, neoadjuvant immunotherapy might prime 
an effective systemic immunity, which could be potentially 
effective in eradicating residual metastatic disease after the 
primary tumor is surgically removed. To study how the thera-
peutic effi
 cacy of different scheduling regimens of surgery and 
immunotherapy affected metastases and survival, we utilized 
two models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the 4T1.2 
and E0771 breast carcinoma cell lines. Following 4T1.2 tumor 
inoculation in the mammary fat pad, and prior to extensive 
primary tumor growth, mice develop extensive metastases in 
the lungs, liver, bones, and brain, among other organs ( 
19 
). 
Similarly, mice inoculated with E0771 develop lethal metas-
tases in the lungs prior to excision of the primary tumor ( 
20 
). 
Previously, the primary tumor has been surgically resected, 
and these mice were then treated with the agent of interest to 
assess how adjuvant therapy affected metastases and survival. 
These two preclinical tumor models are generally utilized 
to mimic a clinical setting of surgery and adjuvant therapy 
of residual metastatic disease. In contrast, carcinogen and 
genetically modifi
 ed mouse models of cancer do not offer this 
opportunity, because few truly metastasize, and metastasis 
is generally minimal relative to primary tumor size with late 
resection becoming impractical. Here, we demonstrate the sig-
nifi
 cantly greater therapeutic power of neoadjuvant compared 
with adjuvant immunotherapies in the context of primary 
tumor resection in two models of TNBC. 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Enhanced Effi
 cacy of Neoadjuvant Treg Depletion 
to Eradicate Metastases 
 
Depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) represents the sim-
plest manipulation and most effective immunotherapy to 
relieve tumor-induced immunosuppression, given it sup-
presses the antitumor activity of different immune cell types 
( 
21 
). We have previously reported conditional Treg depletion 
alone can eradicate a proportion of established experimental 
tumors and those arising from  
de novo 
 carcinogenesis ( 
22 
). 
This therapy was used initially as a “proof of principle” to 
answer the question of whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy 
was more effective compared with adjuvant immunother-
apy. We injected 4T1.2 tumors into BALB/c FOXP3-GFP-
DTR mice (FOXP3-DTR) where all Tregs (defi
 ned as CD4 
+ 
 
FOXP3 
+ 
) express GFP, allowing for detection, and express 
human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor, which allows for their 
conditional depletion following DT treatment (ref.  
23 
;  
Fig. 
1A 
). Our data demonstrated that a proportion of mice that 
received neoadjuvant or adjuvant Treg depletion had sig-
nifi
 cantly improved long-term survival (>250 days) compared 
with the control group that received PBS, where all mice 
died by day 100 ( 
Fig. 1A 
). More striking was the result from 
the neoadjuvant Treg-depleted group, where almost all mice 
(19/20) displayed long-term survival compared with adjuvant 
Treg-depleted mice (5/20;  
Fig. 1A 
). 
 
 
The improved survival of mice treated with neoadjuvant 
Treg depletion was also demonstrated by the lack of observ-
able micrometastases in the lungs of these mice (0/5; as 
measured by IHC), when harvested 30 days after tumor 
inoculation compared with PBS-treated mice (4/5;  
P 
 < 0.05, 
Fisher exact test; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Although micro-
metastases were also observed in a proportion of the adjuvant 
Treg-depleted group (3/5), this was not statistically signifi
 -
cant when compared with the neoadjuvant Treg-depleted 
group (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In an attempt to determine 
differences in 4T1.2 tumor burden between the adjuvant and 
neoadjuvant Treg-depleted groups, we performed q-PCR in 
the lungs of these mice harvested 30 days after tumor inocu-
lation to measure for gp70 expression as a more sensitive 
method to detect the presence of 4T1.2 tumors (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1B). Envelope glycoprotein (gp70), encoded by the 
endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV), is universally 
expressed in a range of mouse cancer cell lines, including 
4T1.2, but is generally silent in normal mouse tissues ( 
24 
). 
Although detectable levels of gp70 were measured in a pro-
portion of the control group (4/5) or those that received 
adjuvant Treg depletion (3/5), it was undetectable in the 
neoadjuvant Treg-depleted group (0/5); the relative gp70 
gene expression levels were not signifi
 cantly different (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1B). Repeat experiments might allow early 
differences in tumor burden between the neoadjuvant-treated 
and adjuvant-treated groups to become clearer, but our data 
in  
Fig. 1A demonstrate strong proof of principle that neoad-
juvant immunotherapy positively affected survival outcomes. 
 
Given that complete Treg depletion is currently not feasible 
in the clinic, we next asked if similar effects could be obtained 
when Tregs were depleted using anti-CD25 mAbs ( 
Fig. 1B 
). 
Prior to the generation of FOXP3-DTR mice, Tregs were 
depleted in mice using anti-CD25, as they highly expressed 
CD25 (IL2Rα). In the clinic, FDA-approved denileukin difti-
tox, an engineered protein combining IL2 and DT which 
binds to the IL2 receptor, has been used as a strategy to reduce 
Treg numbers in patients. Importantly, results from  
Fig. 1B 
 
validated our hypothesis that neoadjuvant immunotherapy 
was more effi
 cacious at generating long-term survivors. Forty 
percent of mice (8/20) in the neoadjuvant anti-CD25–treated 
group survived long term compared with those that received 
adjuvant anti-CD25 (10%; 2/20). Although the proportion of 
long-term survivors in the neoadjuvant anti-CD25–treated 
group was lower compared with that of the neoadjuvant Treg-
depleted mice, this result was still striking, considering only 
one dose of treatment was administered. In contrast, adjuvant 
anti-CD25–treated mice displayed no statistically enhanced 
survival over mice that received cIg ( 
Fig. 1B 
). Importantly, this 
improved effi
 cacy of neoadjuvant Treg depletion on metasta-
ses and long-term survival depended critically on resection of 
the primary tumor ( 
Fig. 1C 
). Neoadjuvant Treg depletion of 
mice that received no surgery did not survive long term, due to 
eventual outgrowth of the primary tumor ( 
Fig. 1C 
).

Enhanced Effi
 cacy of Neoadjuvant Anti–PD-1 and 
Anti-CD137 to Eradicate Metastases 
 
To determine if the above fi
 ndings were specifi
 cally due to 
Treg depletion or whether these also applied to immunothera-
pies currently being used clinically, we next compared the effi
 -
cacy of neoadjuvant and adjuvant administration of anti–PD-1 
in 4T1.2 tumor–bearing BALB/c mice ( 
Fig. 2A 
). In the clinic, 
anti-human PD-1 antibodies (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) 
are FDA approved and have produced 20% to 50% objective 
response rates in a range of cancer types, including melanoma, 
renal cancer, and NSCLC ( 
2 
). Clinical activity for anti–PD-1 
and anti–PD-L1 was recently reported in trials of patients with 
TNBC, suggesting a broader group of cancers may benefi
 t 
from checkpoint blockade ( 
25 
). 4T1.2 is a mouse model of 
TNBC and, similarly, we have previously demonstrated that 
adjuvant anti–PD-1 given after 4T1.2 tumor resection can 
minimally extend survival, although no long-term survivors 
were obtained ( 
26 
). In this experiment, we further delayed 
commencement of treatment to assess how anti–PD-1 affected 
heavier metastatic burden ( 
Fig. 2A 
). Although neoadjuvant 
anti–PD-1-treated mice displayed signifi
 cantly longer survival 
compared with those that received adjuvant anti–PD-1, no 
mice survived long term ( 
Fig. 2A 
). 
 
 
It is now obvious from both preclinical models and recent 
clinical trials that combination approaches may be required

A, DT (250 ng/mouse, i.p.), or  
B, anti-CD25 
mAb (500 μg/mouse, i.p.) on either day 10 or 16, respectively, whereas 
the control group received PBS or control IgG (500 μg/mouse, i.p.) on 
both days 10 and 16 as indicated in the schematic. All primary tumors 
were resected on day 13. The Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival

for optimally effective and broadly applicable cancer immu-
notherapy ( 
27–29 
). CD137 is a costimulatory receptor selec-
tively expressed on activated T and natural killer (NK) cells 
( 
30 
), and anti-CD137 has been shown to be particularly 
effective in mouse tumor models. Furthermore, in clinical 
trials, anti-CD137 alone has demonstrated some effi
 cacy 
with combinations currently being tested in a number of 
solid tumors and hematologic malignancies ( 
31 
). Thus, we 
next set up an experiment similar to  
Fig. 2A 
 to test the 
antitumor effi
 cacy of neoadjuvant or adjuvant administra-
tion of anti–PD-1 in combination with anti-CD137 ( 
Fig. 
2B 
). Validating our hypothesis, 50% of 4T1.2 tumor–bearing 
mice that received neoadjuvant anti–PD-1 + anti-CD137 dis-
played long-term survival compared with those that received 
adjuvant anti–PD-1 + anti-CD137 (no survivors;  
Fig. 2B 
). 
As before, we demonstrated that the effi
 cacy of neoadjuvant 
anti–PD-1 + anti-CD137 to affect metastases and generation 
of long-term survivors depended on removal of the primary 
tumor ( 
Fig. 2B 
, no surgery group), as primary growth was 
initially suppressed but relapsed (data not shown), similar to 
 
Fig. 1C 
. To confi
 rm the generality of the fi
 ndings observed 
with the 4T1.2 model, we also set up similar experiments 
using the E0771 mammary carcinoma cell line injected 
into the mammary fat pad of C57BL/6 WT mice (ref.  
20 
; 
 
Fig. 2C and D 
). Again, neoadjuvant anti–PD-1 + anti-CD137 
treatment resulted in 40% (4/10) of E0771 tumor–bear-
ing mice surviving long-term compared with no survivors 
among those that received adjuvant anti–PD-1 + anti-CD137 
( 
Fig. 2C 
). Similarly, when surgeries were performed on the 
same day, neoadjuvant compared with adjuvant anti–PD-1 
+ anti-CD137–treated mice had signifi
 cantly improved long-
term survival (6/9; 67% vs. 0%;  
Fig. 2D 
). Interestingly, unlike 
the 4T1.2 tumor model ( 
Fig. 2A 
), adjuvant anti–PD-1 alone 
was ineffective, and neoadjuvant anti–PD-1 did not extend 
overall survival ( 
Fig. 2D 
). In contrast, neoadjuvant anti-
CD137 alone signifi
 cantly prolonged survival of treated mice 
compared with a group treated with adjuvant anti-CD137 
( 
Fig. 2D 
). Overall, we demonstrated the superior effi
 cacy of 
neoadjuvant, compared with adjuvant, administration of 
four different immunotherapies in two spontaneous mouse 
models of metastases. These data were very impressive 
because the 4T1.2 tumor is highly spontaneously metastatic 
and widely acknowledged as extremely diffi
 cult to eradicate 
once the primary tumor is established ( 
19 
). This result con-
trasted with all our previous studies using this model, where 
various adjuvant immunotherapies improved survival fol-
lowing primary tumor resection, but long-term survival was 
rarely obtained ( 
19, 26, 32, 33 
).

C, As indicated in the schematic, groups of mice ( 
n = 10/group) received neoadjuvant anti–PD-1 and anti-CD137 mAb (100 μg/mouse of each mAb, i.p.) 
or control IgG (200 μg/mouse, i.p.) on days 16 and 18, and their primary tumors were resected on day 20. Other groups of mice had their primary tumors 
resected on day 16 and were treated with adjuvant anti–PD-1 and anti-CD137 mAb (100 μg/mouse of each mAb, i.p.) or control IgG (200 μg/mouse, i.p.) 
on days 20 and 22.

 As indicated in the schematic, groups of mice ( 
n = 7–9/group) received neoadjuvant anti–PD-1 mAb or anti-CD137 mAb alone or 
in combination (100 μg/mouse of each mAb, i.p.) or control IgG (200 μg/mouse, i.p.) on days 14 and 16. Other groups of mice were treated with adjuvant 
anti–PD-1 mAb or anti-CD137 mAb alone or in combination (100 μg/mouse of each mAb, i.p.) or control IgG (200 μg/mouse, i.p.) on days 20 and 22. All 
groups of mice had their primary tumors resected on day 18. The Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival of each group are shown. Signifi

Improved Effi
 cacy of Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy 
Is Not Due to Differences in Metastatic Burden 
 
We next wanted to eliminate the possibility that the 
improved effi
 cacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy was sim-
ply due to differences in metastatic burden in the mice at 
the time of treatment. We thus set up a series of experiments 
where we varied the schedule of neoadjuvant and adjuvant 
immunotherapy administration ( 
Fig. 3 
). First, delaying neo-
adjuvant DT to the same day as mice receiving adjuvant 
DT (day 16) still resulted in 35% (7/20) long-term survivors 
compared with 5% (1/20) of adjuvant Treg-depleted mice 
( 
Fig. 3A 
). When we pooled all experiments where mice were 
treated with either late neoadjuvant DT (3 experiments) or 
adjuvant DT (7 experiments), far more long-term survivors 
were observed in the late neoadjuvant DT-treated (14/28) 
compared with adjuvant DT-treated groups (9/59; Supple-
mentary Fig. S2). Additionally, we also demonstrated that 
the metastatic burden (as measured by gp70 expression 
levels) was similar in the lungs of 4T1.2 tumor–bearing mice 
at the time when they would normally receive neoadjuvant 
or adjuvant DT (i.e., day 10 or 16, respectively; data not 
shown). We performed q-PCR to detect gp70 expression as 
a measure of 4T1.2 tumor burden, given that no observable 
micrometastases were detectable by hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) staining, and observed no signifi
 cant differences 
(data not shown). Next, when we shifted the schedule of 
surgery and adjuvant Treg depletion to the same time points 
as when neoadjuvant Treg depletion followed by surgery 
was given (i.e., days 10 and 13), neoadjuvant Treg depletion 
was still superior ( 
Fig. 3B 
). Similarly, whether neoadjuvant 
or adjuvant anti–PD-1 alone or anti–PD-1 + anti-CD137 
therapies were administered on the same day ( 
Fig. 3C 
) or 
surgeries were performed on the same day ( 
Fig. 3D 
), we still 
observed a signifi
 cant proportion of mice surviving long 
term following neoadjuvant, but not adjuvant, immuno-
therapy. Simply, surgery-related effects were insuffi
 cient 
for the effi
 cacy of neoadjuvant anti–PD-1 + anti-CD137 
therapy, because neoadjuvant therapy followed by sham 
surgery did not enable long-term survivors (Supplementary 
Fig. S3A and S3B). 
 
 
Our fi
 nding that immunotherapy worked more effectively 
in a neoadjuvant setting raised the question as to whether 
chemotherapy would also be more effective when given in a

neoadjuvant setting in this model (Supplementary Fig. S4). 
We chose paclitaxel given its use in the treatment of women 
with metastatic breast cancer and its adjuvant activity in the 
4T1.2 model post surgery ( 
34 
). Interestingly, mice given neo-
adjuvant paclitaxel displayed no signifi
 cant benefi
 t over mice 
that received adjuvant paclitaxel, despite the chemotherapy 
being partially effective in both settings and prolonging 
survival (Supplementary Fig. S4). These data suggest that 
not all effective cancer therapies benefi
 ted from neoadjuvant 
scheduling. 
 
 
Long-term Survivors Following Neoadjuvant 
Immunotherapy-Treated Groups Are Cured 
 
We next performed a series of experiments to deter-
mine if long-term surviving mice in the neoadjuvant Treg-
depleted mice were cured or harbored dormant tumors 
(Supplementary Fig. S5). No detectable levels of gp70 were 
found in the lungs of these mice (>250 days after tumor 
challenge; Supplementary Fig. S5A). We have previously 
demonstrated in a methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced 
model of tumor dormancy that the equilibrium period 
can exist for much of the life of the mouse (hundreds of 
days) and is actively controlled by the immune system ( 
35, 
36 
). Depletion of CD8/CD4 T cells and/or neutralization of 
IFNγ in mice with dormant MCA-induced tumors resulted 
in their rapid outgrowth. To examine this, another cohort 
of long-term survivors from the neoadjuvant DT-treated 
group was depleted of NK and T cells over a period of 4 
weeks. No reduction in survival was observed, suggesting 
no latent tumor cells were present in these mice (Supple-
mentary Fig. S5B). As an alternative approach, to assess 
whether long-term surviving mice were cured because they 
had developed a strong protective memory response, another 
cohort of these surviving mice or naïve age-matched FOXP3-
DTR mice were challenged with 4T1.2 tumors either sub-
cutaneously or in the mammary fat pad (on the opposite 
fl
 ank; Supplementary Fig. S5C and S5D), or injected i.v. for 
experimental lung metastases (Supplementary Fig. S5E). In 
all experiments, these long-term survivors did not develop 
progressively growing tumors or metastases compared with 
controls. Collectively, our data clearly demonstrated that 
neoadjuvant DT-treated long-term survivors were free of

Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Depends 
on CD8 
+ 
 T Cells and IFNf 
 
We next examined the effector pathways and immune 
cells that were involved in the protective effect of neoadju-
vant anti–PD-1 + anti-CD137 treatment using gene-targeted 
mice or depleting/neutralizing antibodies ( 
Fig. 4 
). In both 
4T1.2 and E0771 tumor models, the effi
 cacy of neoadjuvant 
therapy was dependent on IFNγ because there were no long-
term survivors when it was neutralized ( 
Fig. 4A and B 
). In 
contrast, loss of perforin did not greatly affect the effi
 cacy of 
neoadjuvant immunotherapy, as a signifi
 cant proportion of 
mice still survived long term ( 
Fig. 4A and B 
). Our experiments 
also suggested all three immune cell types, CD8, CD4, and 
NK cells, were required, although the relative importance of 
each subset varied depending on the tumor type and therapy 
( 
Fig. 4C 
; Supplementary Fig. S6). 
 
 
 
Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Increases Tumor-
Specifi
 c CD8 
+ 
 T Cells in Peripheral Blood and Organs 
 
We next dissected the mechanism by which neoadjuvant 
immunotherapy induced better antitumor immunity com-
pared with adjuvant treatment. Given the importance of 
CD8 
+ 
 T cells in both 4T1.2 and E0771 tumor models, we fi
 rst 
asked if their proportion was changed and whether it could 
be detected in the blood early after treatment. As we did 
not observe any changes in the proportion of total CD8 
+ 
 T 
cells between the neoadjuvant and adjuvant Treg-depleted or 
anti–PD-1/CD137–treated groups (data not shown), we next 
determined whether changes could be detected if we meas-
ured for tumor-reactive gp70 tetramer-specifi
 c CD8 
+ T cells, 
as previously reported ( 
Fig. 4D 
; ref.  
37 
). Prior to therapy on 
day 10, tumor-bearing mice had similar levels of peripheral 
blood gp70 tumor–specifi
 c CD8 
+ T cells among the differ-
ent groups. Strikingly, 4 days after neoadjuvant anti–PD-1 + 
anti-CD137 therapy, we observed a strong increase in tumor-
specifi
 c CD8 
+ T cells. Although this decreased following

trast, we did not observe this same magnitude of increase in

( 
Fig. 5B and C and  
Fig. 6A–D 
; day 20). This suggests that 
the primary tumor may contribute to the systemic increase 
of these tumor-specifi
 c T cells; however, importantly, the 
effector function of tumor-specifi
 c T cells in the no-surgery 
group was poor compared with neoadjuvant immunother-
apy-treated and tumor-resected groups ( 
Fig. 6E–G 
). We also 
observed increased numbers of gp70 tumor–specifi
 c CD8

T cells in the resected primary tumors of neoadjuvant Treg-
depleted (Supplementary Fig. S8B) or anti–PD-1 + anti–
CD137-treated (Supplementary Fig. S8C) mice compared 
with resected tumors that did not receive therapy. In the 
same experiment, we observed that the tumor-specifi
 c CD8

T cells from the neoadjuvant Treg-depleted group displayed 
an effector/memory phenotype (CD44

( 
Fig. 7B 
), the majority of mice that displayed the highest 
levels of tumor-specifi
 c CD8 
+ T cells at day 14 or 15 (i.e., 4 
days after neoadjuvant therapy) survived greater than 100 
days and generally went on to become long-term survivors. 
In contrast, neoadjuvant-treated mice that had lower lev-
els of tumor-specifi
 c CD8 
+ 
 T cells did not survive more 
than 100 days. Similarly, adjuvant-treated mice generally had 
lower levels of tumor-specifi
 c CD8 
+ 
 T cells compared with 
neoadjuvant-treated groups when measured at day 20 (i.e., 
4 days after adjuvant therapy). The magnitude of tumor-
specifi
 c CD8 
+ 
 T cells as a predictor of long-term survival 
was more clearly observed in mice that received neoadjuvant 
anti–PD-1 + anti-CD137 therapy ( 
Fig. 7B 
), perhaps refl
 ecting 
the stronger dependency on CD8 
+ 
 T cells for this therapy 
( 
Fig. 4C 
). Indeed, for this therapy, we observed a correlation 
between survival outcomes and the level of peripheral tumor-
specifi
 c CD8 
+ T cells, although the relationship was not 
exactly linear ( 
Fig. 7C 
). Interestingly, we also observed that 
gp70 tumor–specifi
 c CD8 
+ 
 T cells in the blood maintained 
their effector memory or central memory phenotype over the 
life of these mice ( 
Fig. 7D and E 
). Intriguingly, it seemed to 
suggest if the level of tumor-specifi
 c CD8 
+ T cells reached a 
certain threshold (∼7%), these mice would most likely survive 
long term. Thus, improved antitumor effi
 cacy induced by 
neoadjuvant immunotherapy may be due to its ability to 
signifi
 cantly increase the number and maintenance of tumor-
specifi
 c CD8 
+ 
 T cells, and the early increase is a biomarker of 
outcome, particularly in CD8 
+ 
 T cell–dependent therapies. 
 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
This report has demonstrated the improved effi
 cacy of 
neoadjuvant immunotherapy to eradicate metastatic disease 
in two preclinical models of TNBC following surgical resec-
tion. The orthotopic 4T1.2 and E0771 tumors represent the 
two best models where surgery and lethal metastases can be 
assessed in the context of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant ther-
apy in a robust and timely manner. In genetically engineered 
tumor models (GEM), primary tumors grow to an unethical 
and unresectable size before there are any signifi
 cant metas-
tases. Other  
de novo 
 models of cancer, including breast cancer, 
do not signifi
 cantly metastasize, and not in a way that the pri-
mary tumor can be resected and survival monitored. Importantly, 
this proof of principle of improved effi
 cacy on neoadjuvant

immunotherapy was demonstrated using four different 
immunotherapies: complete Treg depletion, anti-CD25, or 
anti–PD-1 alone or in combination with anti-CD137. Indeed, 
by deliberately performing the neoadjuvant and adjuvant 
immunotherapies using a variety of different schedules, we 
provided validation that neoadjuvant immunotherapies were 
superior. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy that was given at the 
same time as the adjuvant immunotherapy or further delayed 
was still more effi
 cacious in inducing long-term survivors. 
 
In our study, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel) in 
our preclinical model did not improve overall long-term sur-
vival when compared with adjuvant chemotherapy, similar 
to reported clinical studies ( 
6 
). Although paclitaxel does not 
cause immunogenic cell death (ICD) and priming of host 
dendritic cells (DC) and T cells ( 
38 
), it still has immunomod-
ulatory activity such as inducing proinfl
 ammatory cytokine 
secretion from macrophages, which can result in immune cell 
activation ( 
39 
). Our data suggest that the improved survival 
benefi
 t of neoadjuvant therapy may be restricted to therapies 
that activate T cell antitumor immunity. Chemotherapeu-
tic agents such as doxorubicin that induce ICD alone or in 
combination with immunotherapy can now be tested in a 
neoadjuvant setting in these models to answer this question. 
 
Recently, a number of clinical trials have commenced 
to assess the effi
 cacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapies 
 
(clinicaltrials.gov); however, only one phase II trial ( 
n 
 = 40) 
is directly comparing neoadjuvant and adjuvant anti–PD-1, 
alone or in combination with anti-CTLA4, in patients with 
resectable melanoma (NCT02519322). In this trial, the pri-
mary and secondary aims are to assess the pathologic and 
immunologic response in the resected tumor. Given that 
overall survival data can take 3 to 5 years to obtain, our data 
now provide strong impetus to set up clinical trials that are 
powered to determine whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy

 Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Is Effective against Metastases

can further improve survival outcomes over adjuvant immu-
notherapy. Unlike our study, patients in this trial who receive 
neoadjuvant treatment will also receive adjuvant treatment 
following resection of their tumors. From our study, a short 
course of neoadjuvant immunotherapy induced long-term 
survivors in a proportion of treated mice. We can now com-
pare in our model if further increase in the proportion of 
long-term survivors can be obtained by maintaining treat-
ment post-surgery in mice given neoadjuvant immunother-
apy. If we observe similar effi
 cacy, it may suggest a short course 
of treatment is suffi
 cient and thus may potentially limit the 
severity of immune-related adverse-event toxicities associated 
with long-term administration of combination immunothera-
pies. Alternatively, in humans, another consideration would 
be whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy might be likely to 
cause serious immune-related adverse events in the fi
 rst few 
cycles and thus potentially prevent timely surgery. These are 
interesting complexities, and it is likely that adjuvant immu-
notherapy will keep its place as a treatment regime, particu-
larly for cancer types where delaying of surgery is not advised. 
In the near future, should neoadjuvant immunotherapy prove 
to have utility, one would envisage that these patients would 
further receive continued immunotherapy following surgery. 
Nevertheless, the optimal patient scheduling and dosing com-
parisons will take considerable time to be validated, and the 
mouse model offers the opportunity to test these features of 
neoadjuvant immunotherapy further. 
 
In our study, we have treated 4T1.2 tumor–bearing mice 
with widespread metastases to mimic clinically advanced-
stage cancers. These mice have multiple organs involved and 
extensive disease can be quantitated by colony formation, 
histopathology, or other means within 2 weeks of primary 
tumor implantation, and these mice die within weeks of the 
primary surgery if untreated ( 
19 
). Although immune check-
point inhibitors to date have shown effi
 cacy in bulky disease, 
neoadjuvant immunotherapy may induce even greater effi
 -
cacy when used in locoregionally advanced cancers that are 
surgically operable but have a high risk of relapse. This could 
include TNBC (as we have shown here), bladder cancer, epi-
thelial ovarian carcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma, of which 
a proportion has already responded to immune checkpoint 
inhibitors. Although anti-CTLA4 + anti–PD-1 is currently the 
only FDA-approved combination immunotherapy, our data 
with anti–PD-1 and anti-CD137 certainly provide a compel-
ling rationale to test this combination in a neoadjuvant set-
ting. Anti–PD-1 and anti-CD137 combinations are currently 
being tested in a number of clinical trials against advanced 
solid tumors and advanced B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(NCT02253992 and NCT02179918). In addition, although 
we have clearly demonstrated the improved effi
 cacy of neo-
adjuvant over adjuvant immunotherapy in two preclinical 
models of breast cancer, confi
 rming these fi
 ndings in other 
tumors of different tissue origin will broaden these fi
 ndings. 
The challenge is fi
 nding additional preclinical tumor models 
that can mimic a clinical setting of surgical resection and 
spontaneous metastasis. 
 
The increased effi
 cacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy to 
induce a greater proportion of long-term survivors compared 
with adjuvant immunotherapy may be explained by its ability 
to increase the numbers of gp70 tumor–specifi
 c T cells that 
were proliferating, displayed an effector/memory  
phenotype, 
and produced IFNγ and TNF in peripheral blood and vari-
ous organs early after treatment. There are a number of 
mechanisms by which this could be mediated. One possibil-
ity is that the release of tumor-specifi
 c antigens from dying 
tumor cells may act as a vaccine to further prime and expand 
tumor-specifi
 c T cells in the primary tumor before they are 
released into the periphery. To test this, the proliferative 
capacity of gp70 tumor–specifi
 c CD8 
+ 
 T cells in the primary 
tumors compared with those in the periphery (e.g., blood and 
lung) can be measured during the fi
 rst 3 days following neo-
adjuvant therapy. Alternatively, tumor antigens from dying 
primary tumor cells may “shower” into the periphery where 
they are processed, presented by antigen-presenting cells to 
prime and expand T cells systematically. Demonstrating this 
will be experimentally challenging, as tumor antigens will 
have to be marked to allow for their tracking in the periphery, 
and this will be complicated by their origin potentially being 
from both the primary tumor and the metastases. Finally, the 
role of the primary tumor itself in modulating immunologic 
changes systematically also has to be examined. The primary 
tumor potentially plays a dual role. The primary tumor has 
to be excised at some point, because it grows and continu-
ally seeds new metastases, and neoadjuvant immunotherapy 
alone cannot eradicate it. Yet its presence is required for the 
expansion of tumor-specifi
 c T cells following neoadjuvant 
immunotherapy, and we did not observe this same magni-
tude of tumor-specifi
 c T-cell expansion in adjuvant-treated 
mice. Notably, untreated mice that did not have their primary 
tumor resected also displayed an increase in tumor-specifi
 c 
T cells over time, but this was limited and proved insuffi
 cient, 
and these T cells displayed poor effector function compared 
with T cells from neoadjuvant-treated mice that had their 
primary tumors resected. To determine how resection of the 
primary tumor affects expansion of tumor-specifi
 c T cells, 
we are currently examining the kinetics of tumor-specifi
 c 
T cells in mice that received no therapy and no surgery com-
pared with those that received neoadjuvant immunotherapy 
with or without surgery. More recently, a study reported 
that the effi
 cacy of anti–PD-1 and anti-CD137 combination 
therapy required cross-priming of tumor antigens by BATF3-
dependent DCs ( 
40 
). Future experiments where neoadjuvant 
anti–PD-1 + anti-CD137 therapy is performed in BATF3-
defi
 cient mice will allow us to answer questions such as 
whether BATF3-dependent DCs are required for the effi
 cacy 
of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and the requirement of the 
primary tumor for cross-priming. Nevertheless, elucidating 
the major reasons the tumor-specifi
 c CD8 
+ 
 T cells increase so 
clearly in the neoadjuvant scheduling is a complex immuno-
logic issue and will take considerably more experimentation 
to determine. 
 
In addition to affecting the quantity of tumor-specifi
 c 
T cells, neoadjuvant immunotherapy may also affect their 
quality. A striking observation of our study was the high pro-
portion of gp70 tumor–specifi
 c CD8 
+ T cells that persisted 
in the blood of long-term survivors (>170 days after tumor 
inoculation) following neoadjuvant Treg depletion or anti–
PD-1 + anti-CD137 therapy. This is in contrast to what has 
been reported for acute viral infection where approximately 
90% to 95% of effector CD8 
+ 
 T cells die following resolution

 central/memory T cells become enriched 
in nonlymphoid or lymphoid organs, respectively, and over 
time, these effector/memory T cells are thought to convert 
to central/memory T cells which have self-renewing capacity 
that does not depend on antigen for their maintenance ( 
41 
). 
In our study, we saw an opposite pattern among the memory 
T cells in the blood of our neoadjuvant immunotherapy–
treated long-term survivors (>170 days after tumor inocula-
tion) where ∼70% were CD44 
+ 
 CD62L 
− and ∼30% were CD44 
+ 
 
CD62L 
+ 
, although staining with CCR7 is required to validate 
their effector or central memory phenotype. Future studies 
will determine if this ratio of effector to central memory T 
cells is specifi
 c to the blood or also present in other sites of 
metastasis such as the lung and liver, as well as in the lymph 
nodes, spleen, and bone marrow, where central memory T 
cells generally localize. Future studies will now aim to fully 
characterize these gp70 tumor–specifi
 c memory CD8 
+ T cells 
on a transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional level to 
understand how they stably persist in such high proportion 
in long-time survivors. 
 
In addition to measuring clinical objectives, neoadjuvant 
immunotherapy allows access to blood and tumor tissue 
prior to and after the initiation of treatment, and thus 
immunomonitoring and identifi
 cation of potential bio-
markers that may be predictive of therapeutic response. In 
our studies, elevated gp70 tumor–specifi
 c CD8 
+ 
 T cells in 
the blood early after neoadjuvant immunotherapy that was 
sustained were a predictor of survival outcomes. In humans, 
tumor-specifi
 c mutant neoantigens (TSMA, or neoantigens) 
have been demonstrated to be critical targets of antitumor 
immune responses ( 
42 
). These antigens are derived from 
oncogenic viral proteins or abnormal proteins that arise as 
a consequence of somatic mutations or posttranslational 
modifi
 cations and are foreign to the host and not subjected 
to central tolerance ( 
43 
). With recent advances in the fi
 eld of 
genomics and bioinformatics, neoantigens can now be more 
easily and rapidly identifi
 ed to generate MHC tetramers ( 
42 
) 
to identify these tumor-specifi
 c T cells. In our preclinical 
study, gp70 likely serves as a tumor-specifi
 c neoantigen and 
probably represents the immunodominant epitope toward 
which the majority of CD8 
+ 
 T-cell responses are directed. 
Although tumor-bearing mice may not be initially centrally 
tolerized to gp70 ( 
44 
), the tumor clearly grows unimpeded, 
resulting in eventual death if no major intervention is pro-
vided. Thus, gp70 represents a relevant neoantigen in the 
mouse spontaneous 4T1.2 tumor model, but clearly other 
tumor-associated and tumor-specifi
 c antigens have to be 
identifi
 ed and tetramers generated in order for them to be 
assessed in the neoadjuvant context. The restriction currently 
faced is the lack of additional suitable metastatic models, 
but at least neoadjuvant priming of peripheral tumor-spe-
cifi
 c T cells can be assessed in other primary tumors pre- and 
post-surgery, regardless of their lack of metastasis. 
 
Although it is currently not clear how many different 
neoantigen-specifi
 c CD8 
+ T cells are required for an effec-
tive clinical response, tumor-specifi
 c T cells reactive to one 
to three neoantigens have generally been reported ( 
45–48 
), 
although T cells from a single patient with reactivity to 
seven neoantigens have been measured ( 
49 
). Similarly, we 
can utilize next-generation deep sequencing and epitope 
prediction algorithms ( 
43 
) to help identify other non-gp70 
tumor–specifi
 c T cells and assess how neoadjuvant immu-
notherapy shapes their kinetic of response and their antitu-
mor contribution in future experiments. In humans, CD4 
+ 
 
T cells specifi
 c for MHC II–restricted tumor neoantigens 
have been identifi
 ed, and their infusion into one patient 
was able to induce sustained tumor regression ( 
48, 50 
). 
Given that depletion of CD4 
+ T cells negated the effi
 cacy 
of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in our study, their tumor 
specifi
 city can also be evaluated, albeit with more chal-
lenges ( 
42 
). In future clinical trials comparing neoadjuvant 
versus adjuvant immunotherapy, it will be important to 
identify and measure tumor-specifi
 c T cells in the blood 
and resected tumors of these patients to determine whether 
they can act as biomarkers to distinguish patients who will 
derive long-term benefi
 t. If validated, this biomarker may 
also identify patients who will require more intervention. 
Positive trial results will further revolutionize the fi
 eld of 
cancer immunotherapy and improve outcomes for patients 
with cancer. 
 
 
METHODS 
 
Mouse Strains 
 
C57BL/6J and BALB/c wild-type (WT) mice were purchased from 
the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research. BALB/c 
FOXP3-DTR-GFP mice were generated by backcrossing C57BL/6 
FOXP3-DTR-GFP mice (kindly provided by Dr. Geoffrey Hill; ref. 
 
23 
) ten generations to BALB/c WT mice. C57BL/6 or BALB/c per-
forin-defi
 cient (pfp 
−/− 
) and BALB/c FOXP3-DTR mice were all bred 
and maintained at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute. 
Female mice greater than 8 weeks old were used in all experiments, 
which were approved by the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Insti-
tute Animal Ethics Committee. 
 
Cell Culture 
 
BALB/c-derived 4T1.2 mammary carcinoma cells were cultured 
in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin, and 
 
L 
- 
glutamine as previously described ( 
51 
). The C57BL/6 E0771 
mammary carcinoma cell lines were cultured in DMEM containing 
10% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin, and  
L 
-glutamine, as previously 
described ( 
51 
). All cell lines were obtained between 2000 and 2008 
and routinely tested negative for  
Mycoplasma. 
 Cell line authentication 
was not routinely performed. 
 
 
Antibodies and Reagents 
 
Purifi
 ed anti-mouse PD-1 mAb (RMP1-14), anti-mouse anti-
CD137 (3H3), control IgG (2A3), anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD8β 
(53.5.8), anti-IFNγ (H22; all from BioXCell), and anti-asGM1 (Wako 
Chemicals) were used in the schedule and doses as indicated. To 
deplete Tregs, BALB/c FOXP3-DTR-GFP mice were injected i.p. with 
250-ng DT (Sigma Aldrich; cat. No. D0564) and used in the schedule 
as indicated. 
 
 
Experimental Tumor Models/Treatments 
 
In the preclinical 4T1.2 breast cancer tumor model, following 
tumor inoculation in the mammary fat pad, mice develop metastases 
in the lungs, liver, bones, and brain, among other organs ( 
19 
). The 
primary tumor is surgically resected, and these mice are then treated

 Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Is Effective against Metastases
RESEARCH ARTICLE
 
DECEMBER  2016�CANCER DISCOVERY | 1397 
with the agent of interest to assess how adjuvant therapy affects 
metastasis and survival. Similar to the 4T1.2 tumor model, injection 
of E0771 into the mammary fat pad of mice results in their metasta-
sizing to the lungs, resulting in death even when the primary tumor 
is resected ( 
20 
). 
 
For spontaneous metastasis and post-surgery survival experi-
ments, the indicated dose of 4T1.2 or E0771 tumor cells suspended 
in 50 μL PBS were always inoculated into the fourth left mammary 
fat pad of female FOXP3-DTR or WT mice. The mean tumor size 
at the time of resection was ∼40 to 80 mm 
2 
. Some experiments 
were performed in a blinded fashion as indicated, and three dif-
ferent investigators performed the experiments. During surgery, 
mice were anesthetized before their primary tumors including 
the draining lymph nodes were resected, and their wounds closed 
with surgical clips. Mice were monitored for symptoms of illness 
with changes to weight, posture, activity, and fur texture, and 
euthanized when clinical symptoms reached the cumulative limit 
outlined by animal ethics. In some experiments where paclitaxel 
was used, the dose and schedule was as previously described ( 
34 
). 
For s.c. or mammary fat-pad rechallenge experiments, long-term 
survivors were always injected with the indicated dose of tumor 
cells on the opposite fl
 ank. 
 
 
Flow Cytometry Analysis 
 
Tumors, blood, spleen, lung, and liver were harvested from mice 
and processed for fl
 ow cytometry analysis as previously described 
( 
22 
). For surface staining, tumor-infi
 ltrating lymphocyte or immune 
cell suspensions were stained with antibodies and respective isotype 
antibodies in the presence of anti-CD16/32 (2.4G2) to block FcR. The 
list of antibodies used is described in the Supplementary Methods (see 
Supplementary Table S1). To stain for Ki67, samples were fi
 xed and 
permeabilized with a FOXP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (eBiosci-
ence). To measure intracellular cytokine staining, single-cell suspen-
sions were incubated for 4 hours in complete RPMI with monensin 
and brefeldin A (eBioscience). Samples were then surface stained before 
being fi
 xed/permeabilized (BD CytoFix/CytoPerm Kit) and stained 
with anti-IFNγ and anti-TNF or fl
 uorescence minus one control for 
IFNγ staining and isotype control for TNF staining. To determine 
absolute counts in samples, liquid counting beads (BD Biosciences) 
were added directly before samples were run on the fl
 ow cytometer. All 
data were collected on a Fortessa 4 (Becton Dickinson) fl
 ow cytometer 
and analyzed with FlowJo v10 software (Tree Star, Inc.). 
 
 
Histology 
 
Mouse tissues were perfusion fi
 xed in 10% neutral buffered for-
malin overnight, processed routinely, and embedded in paraffi
 n. 
Sections (8 μm) were cut and stained with H&E. H&E-stained tissue 
sections were imaged by using Aperio Scanscope AT (Leica) and ana-
lyzed by Aperio ImageScope. 
 
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
The animal numbers used for all experiments are outlined in 
the corresponding fi
 gure legends. Groups of 5 to 10 mice per 
experiment were generally used. No statistical method was used to 
predetermine sample size. No method of randomization was used 
to allocate animals to experimental groups except for  
Fig. 4D 
,  
Figs. 
5 
– 
7 
, and Supplementary Figs. S7–S9. Across all experiments, we did 
not exclude samples or mice from the analysis with the exception of 
two samples due to technical fl
 aws in execution. The investigators 
were not blinded to the group allocation during the experiment 
and/or when assessing the outcome except for  
Fig. 1A 
 and Supple-
mentary Fig. S6. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad 
Prism software. Comparison of different groups was carried out 
using either an unpaired Student  
t test, unpaired Welch  
t 
 test, 
one-way ANOVA or Mann–Whitney  
U 
 test. In some experiments, 
to determine what immunologic effects were induced 4 days after 
respective neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, signifi
 cance had to be 
performed on different days. We tested for the assumption of une-
qual variances using the Bartlett test. In instances where we found 
unequal variances, we used the Welch  
t 
 test. Kaplan–Meier analyses 
with a log-rank sum test were used for animal survival experiments. 
We did not adjust for all multiple comparisons between the survival 
curves because we were only concerned with a limited number of 
comparisons between groups. Data were considered to be statisti-
cally signifi
 cant where the  
P value was equal to or less than 0.05.
