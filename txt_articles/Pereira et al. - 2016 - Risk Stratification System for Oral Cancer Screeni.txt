Abstract
Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer (oral cancer) is a deadly
disease that is increasing in incidence. Worldwide 5-year survival
is only 50% due to delayed intervention with more than halfof the
diagnoses at stage III and IV, whereas earlier detection (stage I and
II) yields survival rates up to 80% to 90%. Salivary soluble CD44
(CD44), a tumor-initiating marker, and total protein levels may
facilitate oral cancer risk assessment and early intervention. This
study used a hospital-based design with 150 cases and 150
frequency-matched controls to determine whether CD44 and
total protein levels in oral rinses were associated with oral cancer
independent of age, gender, race, ethnicity, tobacco and alcohol
use, and socioeconomic status (SES). High-risk subjects receiving
oral cancer prevention interventions as part of a community-
based program (n ¼ 150) were followed over 1 year to determine
marker specificity and variation. CD44 �5.33 ng/mL was highly
associated with case status [adjusted OR 14.489; 95% confi-
dence interval (CI), 5.973–35.145; P < .0001, vs. reference
group CD44 <2.22 ng/mL and protein <1.23 mg/mL]. Total
protein aided prediction above CD44 alone. Sensitivity and
specificity in the frequency-matched study was 80% and 48.7%,
respectively. However, controls were not representative of
the target screening population due, in part, to a high rate
of prior cancer. In contrast, specificity in the high-risk commu-
nity was 74% and reached 95% after annual retesting. Simple
and inexpensive salivary CD44 and total protein measurements
may help identify individuals at heightened risk for oral
cancer from the millions who partake in risky behaviors.

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which
includes cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx, affects
550,000 people worldwide each year (1). In India, oral cancer,
defined here as cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx, is the
most common fatal cancer in middle-aged men, and it is the
costliest cancer in low-income countries (2, 3). The main risk
factors include tobacco use, alcohol use, and human papilloma-
virus (HPV) infection (4–6). The incidence of oral cancer is rising
with the increasing incidence of HPVþ oropharyngeal cancer (7).
Worldwide 5-year survival only reaches 50%, largely due to
late-stage (III or IV) presentation (8). Upper aerodigestive tract
(UADT) mucosa progresses through a premalignant phase,
dysplasia, prior to development of frank malignancy. Dysplasia
is reversible (9) and can regress with tobacco cessation or
spontaneously (10, 11). Unfortunately, dysplasia often mimics
characteristics
of
benign
inflammation
so,
frequently,
it
remains occult until further progression results in late-stage
cancer diagnosis (12).
Screening for HNSCC in India reduced oral cancer mortality by
over 80% in tobacco and/or alcohol users (13). Screening by oral
exam followed by tissue biopsy, the gold standard, has only 64%
sensitivity for oral cancer (8) and 31% specificity for oral dysplasia
or cancer (14).
Molecular tests including hypermethylation, RNA, and pro-
tein-based panels are under development, but not validated
(15–18). Other technologies that use dyes, autofluorescence, or
exfoliative cytology as adjuncts to the physical examination are
used in clinical practice but have not improved early detection
rates (19, 20).
CD44, a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein involved in
cell proliferation, cell migration, and tumor initiation (21–24) is
overexpressed in premalignant lesions (25–27). Soluble CD44
(solCD44), released by proteinases, is detectable in body fluids
(28, 29). Prior work suggests that total protein is also an effective
oral cancer marker (30, 31). Both can be measured with simple,
inexpensive assays and are overexpressed in oral cavity and
oropharyngeal cancers suggesting usefulness in both HPV-posi-
tive and negative disease (29–32).

 This study uses a case–control, hospital-based design to eval-
uate salivary markers in oral cancer cases and controls, frequency-
matched for important risk and demographic factors to determine
whether CD44 and total protein levels are associated with cancer
rather than potential confounders. The markers are then tested in
a community at elevated risk for oral cancer (n ¼ 150) at baseline
and 1-year follow-up to examine marker changes over time.
Moreover, this study begins to explore whether oral rinse CD44
and total protein levels (i) detect both HPVþ and HPV� disease,
(ii) are associated with prognosis, and (iii) change over a 1-year
period. The outcome of this work is a reliable, inexpensive, and
noninvasive risk prediction test for oral cancer with potential to
greatly benefit populations that suffer most from this disease.
Materials and Methods
Case–control design to determine marker cut-off points
Subjects for the 2012 hospital-based, case–control study were
recruited from clinics at the University of Miami Sylvester Com-
prehensive Cancer Center (UM, Miami, FL) and Jackson Memorial
Hospital (JMH, Miami, FL) between 2007 and 2012 (Fig. 1). This
study evaluated whether soluble salivary tumor markers distin-
guish 150 oral cancer patients from 150 controls frequency
matched for age, gender, race, ethnicity, tobacco, and alcohol
use, and socioeconomic status (SES). Oral cancer cases included
newly diagnosed, previously untreated subjects with squamous
cell carcinoma. Control subjects were identified from family
medicine and internal medicine clinics and chosen prior to testing
so that the key covariates (age, tobacco use etc.) in the control
group were not significantly different from the covariates in the
case group. All subjects were recruited equally from UM, a private
university hospital system serving mostly insured, white patients
and JMH, a county hospital system serving primarily low-income
patients and a large minority population. All subjects completed a
questionnaire including demographics, behavioral risk factors,
and SES. For cases, data on tumor characteristics and outcomes
were extracted from medical records. Controls with lesions sus-
picious for oral cancer were excluded as were HIVþ or pregnant
individuals. Exclusion decisions were blinded to marker level
results. The resulting marker panel was validated using 27 oral
cavity and oropharyngeal cases and 39 high-risk controls enrolled
between 2004 and 2006 in a previous case–control study (31).

 cancer independent of demographic and risk variables. To deter-
mine the specificity of the markers in a potential target screening
population, the marker panel developed using data from the 2012
hospital-based, case–control study was evaluated in 150 partici-
pants from a community previously determined to be at elevated
risk for oral cancer due to poverty and smoking (33). Subjects in
this study received free head and neck cancer screening, education
on smoking cessation, good nutrition, and oral health. This
community control group was followed over time; baseline and
annual follow-up oral rinses were obtained and measured
between the years 2011 and 2013 to assess specificity and vari-
ation in marker levels. As the community control group was still at
elevated risk for cancer, we also estimated true specificity in a
group of 21 normal volunteers who were primarily nonsmokers.
All participants consented according to The Code of Ethics of
the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).
Laboratory analysis
Oral rinses were collected using a previously published method
that samples the oral cavity and oropharynx (29–32). Levels of
solCD44 (normal and variant isoforms) were measured using a
sandwich ELISA assay (eBioscience), with previously published
modifications (29–32). We performed the DC protein assay
(Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol
using saliva samples prepared as previously published (29–32).
Each sample was tested in duplicate and the technician was
blinded to disease status.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were retrieved
from cases, where available (n ¼ 79). HPV status was assessed
using p16INK4A IHC, an accepted surrogate marker for HPV
(34–36).p16INK4A was performed according to the manufac-
turer's IHC protocol on 68 specimens (BD Biosciences). In
addition, HPV status was already available in 11 cases (IHC,
n ¼ 10 or in situ hybridization, n ¼ 1). All specimens were
reviewed by a pathologist (C. Gomez), blinded to the patient's
clinical data. p16INK4A expression was scored as positive if
strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasm staining was present
in �50% of the tumor specimen (36).
Statistical analysis
Patient groups were compared with respect to the distribution
of potentially important categorical covariates using the c2 test or
Fisher exact test. Data on solCD44 were log base-2 transformed to
stabilize estimates of variance and improve the fit to the normal
distribution. Continuous variables were analyzed using Student t
test or ANOVA followed by Fisher least significant difference test
for pairwise mean comparison, and tests of prespecified contrasts.
Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association
between markers and the risk for oral cancer. OR estimates were
reported with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI)
and AUC of the ROC for fitted models. Estimates of sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy were derived from a fitted multivariable
logistic model which included significant interactions between
markers and covariates as well as from a model including only risk
groups based on cut-off points for solCD44 and protein that were
derived using multivariate recursive partitioning analysis (37)
implemented in the R-packages MVPART (v.1.6.1.) and Recursive
Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART), version 1.6-0 (38).
Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression models were used to evaluate
PFS and OS. HR estimates and corresponding 95% CI are
reported. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version
9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc.) and R package.
Results
Characteristics of hospital-based case–control study
The description of the hospital-based, case–control study,
comprising 150 patients with oral cancer and 150 controls, is
summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1. There were no significant
differences between cases and controls with respect to age, gender,
race, SES, oral health (number of teeth removed), smoking
history, alcohol habit, or enrollment clinic (county JMH versus
private hospital UM system). Supplementary Table S1 (online
version only) shows cancer-specific characteristics for cases.
Log2solCD44, hereafter referred to as CD44, and total protein
were evaluated with respect to risk factors or demographic vari-
ables within the case and control groups (Table 2). CD44 and
protein were higher in cases compared with controls at the P <
0.05 level when age, gender, race/ethnicity, SES, smoking habit or
drinking habit, teeth loss, or ability to gargle were considered. This
provides strong evidence that CD44 and total protein levels are
associated with oral cancer independent of these risk factors. In
cases but not in controls, CD44 was significantly higher in subjects
who were older, had worse gargle ability, and more teeth loss.
CD44 and protein did not differ significantly by TNM status or
HPV status.
HPVþ tumors, frequent in nonsmokers with oropharyngeal
HNSCC, have a better prognosis compared with smoking and
alcohol-related tumors (39).HPVþ tumors are rarely found in the
oral cavity (OC). In our study, only 4 of the 31 HPVþ tumors
were from the OC (see Supplementary Table S1, online only). The
CD44 levels between the 4 OC HPVþ and 27 HPVþ oropharyngeal
(OP) cases were not significantly different. The total protein
levels were significantly lower (OC, 0.54 mg/mL; OP, 0.93 mg/mL;
P ¼ 0.001) in the OC compared with OP HPVþ samples.
Risk modeling
In univariate analysis, CD44 and total protein were significant-
ly associated with cancer status with an OR for 1-unit increase in
CD44 of 2.036 (95% CI, 1.552–2.671; P < 0.0001, AUC¼0.68)
and for 1-unit increase in protein of 2.159 (95% CI, 1.288–3.617;
P < 0.003, AUC¼0.59). The AUC was improved to 0.763 in a
multivariable model including adjustments for important vari-
ables and their interactions, which removed residual confounding
not accounted for in the frequency matching. The OR for CD44
increased to 2.684 (95% CI, 1.797–4.010; P < 0.0001), while the
OR for protein became less than 1 and nonsignificant (OR ¼
0.646; 95% CI, 0.301–1.386; P ¼ 0.262; Table 3, part A). This
model "markers þ covariates" with AUC ¼ 0.763 provided
significantly better prediction than the reduced model excluding
both markers and only including potential risk factors (AUC ¼
0.686; P ¼ 0.003), indicating that the markers aid prediction over
and above prediction provided by knowledge of risk factors alone.
Findings for the analysis stratified by p16INK4A (surrogate for
HPV status) were similar to the combined analysis. In the HPV�
group, protein levels were associated with a significant protective
effect following multivariate analysis (Table 3, part B).
Multivariate recursive partitioning and logistic regression anal-
yses were employed to understand the relationship between
CD44, protein, and prediction of disease presence (Table 3, part
C). Importantly, when covariates including CD44, protein, age,

 gender, race, ethnicity, and SES, were included into the model,
CD44 and protein were the most important predictors of cancer
status, defining five risk groups. Furthermore, we found that the
AUC ¼ 0.722 for the risk group model defined by CD44 and
protein is significantly different from AUC ¼ 0.681 for the
univariate log2 CD44 model (P ¼ 0.025), indicating that the
addition of protein improves prediction.
The classification tree defined subjects as "controls" if CD44
was <2.22 ng/mL and protein was <1.23 mg/mL (reference
group) or if CD44 was �2.22 and <5.33 ng/mL and protein was
�0.558 mg/mL (Table 3, part C). However, compared with
reference group, the OR for the latter group was 2.192 (95% CI,
1.247–3.854) and significant (P ¼ 0.006), indicating elevated
risk. Furthermore, many cancer subjects and 2 control subjects
who went on to develop cancer during the course of the study
had levels that fell into this medium CD44 and medium-to-
high protein group leading us to consider this group as a case
group. The other groups classified as "cases" included subjects
with CD44 <2.22 ng/mL and protein �1.23 mg/mL, CD44 �
2.22 and <5.33 ng/mL and protein <0.558 mg/mL, and CD44 �
5.33 ng/mL, regardless of protein level. Thus, based on the
levels of CD44 and total protein, we identified 4 of the 5 groups
at risk as cases. ORs derived from a multivariate model includ-
ing risk groups defined by CD44 and protein, demographic,
and risk factors showed similar results (Table 3, part C). The
percentage of cancer patients that fell into each risk category by
HPV status and stage is shown (Supplementary Table S2, online
version only).
Defining the reference group as control and all others as
cases, sensitivity was 80.7% and specificity was 48.7% for the
2012 hospital-based group (see Table 3, part C for numbers of
cases and controls that fell into each group). Sensitivity reached
80% for stages I–IV, and 85% for stage I–II. These results were
validated using CD44 and total protein results from a similar
hospital-based study whose enrollment was completed in 2006
(single test, stage I–IV: sensitivity 2012 ¼ 80.7%; 2006 ¼
77.8%; specificity 2012 ¼ 48.7%; 2006 ¼ 56.4%). The frequen-
cy-matched control group was at exceptionally high risk for
cancer as over 10% of these controls had a history of prior
cancer outside the UADT. Hospital-based controls with history
of cancer had significantly higher solCD44 and protein levels
compared with controls without prior cancer (P < 0.05). Thus,
the community-based population was used to estimate the
specificity of the test. This is in keeping with suggestions by
the Early Detection Research Network who note that control
subjects from clinical settings may not be representative of
control subjects recruited from the population because they
have been referred for some reason to the clinic (40). They
suggest that, although selection based on convenience may be
necessary early, final conclusions should be based on popula-
tion-based studies, if possible (40).
Specificity in a target screening population
To predict specificity in a true screening population, a com-
munity at high-risk for HNSCC [n ¼ 150, see Supplementary
Table S3 (online version only) for demographic and risk
characteristics] was evaluated. These subjects were all Afri-
can-American, they were heavier smokers and drinkers, and had
worse oral health than the cases. They were younger than the cases
and were enrolled from a community center rather than a clinic.
We also studied oral rinses from 21 normal volunteers. Specificity
was greatest in the normal volunteers (95.2%). Specificity was
74% (n ¼ 150) after one baseline evaluation but also reached 95%
in the high-risk community in subjects retested at one year (n ¼
95). In the latter case, a result was considered positive if both the
baseline and annual result were positive. Importantly, these

 distribution of changes in CD44 and protein over 1 year is
shown in Fig. 2A and B, respectively. The average annual drop
in CD44 of 0.439 ng/mL (24%) was significant (P < .0001).
Linear regression analysis confirmed a significant linear trend
for lower CD44 values [R2 ¼ 0.227, intercept ¼ 0.785 (P <
.0001), slope ¼ 0.331 (P < .0001); Fig. 2C]. Mean protein also
dropped from 0.644 to 0.543 mg/mL (P ¼ 0.036) with
confirmation by linear regression analysis [R2 ¼ 0.108; inter-
cept ¼ 0.284 (P ¼ 0.002), slope ¼ 0.402 (P < .0001); Fig. 2D].
Of 22 community subjects at baseline elevated risk, only 5
remained in an at-risk category after 1-year follow-up suggest-
ing that retesting may improve specificity.
To determine whether the decreased marker levels were due
to variation in assay conditions over the course of the year
rather than a true decrease in the markers, a baseline second
aliquot (baseline 2) was run on the same plate as the annual
follow-up collection with 81 such pairs for each assay (protein
and CD44). The average drop in levels between baseline 2 and
annual follow-up was significant for CD44 (CD44: 0.296 ng/
mL, P ¼ 0.023; protein: 0.013 mg/mL, P ¼ 0.796) while linear
regression showed a significant trend towards lower numbers
for both markers [CD44: R2 ¼ 0.227; intercept ¼ 0.882 (P <
.0001), slope ¼ 0.288 (P < .0001); protein. R2 ¼ 0.155;
intercept ¼ 0.256 (P ¼ 0.008), slope ¼ 0.534 (P < .0001);
figures not shown]. We also fit linear regression of baseline 2 on
baseline 1. For CD44, linear regression indicated that the two
baselines were equivalent suggesting that the changes in CD44
level were not due to technical changes in the assay. The
differences between baselines for protein were not within the
expected random variation (data not shown).
Prognostic significance of markers
Overdiagnosis has been observed in breast, prostate, and
thyroid cancer screening (41). To avoid this, markers should
identify aggressive forms of oral cancer rather than indolent
cancers that will not cause significant problems during a patient's
lifetime (41). We assessed marker association with prognostic
factors and adjusted for confounders such as stage to determine
whether the markers have potential to detect early, aggressive
forms of the disease. Kaplan–Meier curves for PFS and OS by risk
group are shown in Fig. 2E and F. Unadjusted and adjusted
estimates of HRs for PFS and OS by risk groups are shown in
Supplementary Table S4 (online version only). On the basis of
multivariate analysis with adjustment for tumor stage, age, gen-
der, race and ethnicity, and SES, hospital-based cases that had
CD44 levels � 5.33 ng/mL, had reduced PFS (adjusted HR ¼
3.919; 95% CI, 1.692–9.080; P ¼ 0.001) and OS (adjusted HR ¼
3.242; 95% CI, 1.299–8.089; P ¼ 0.012) compared with cases in
the reference group. Subjects with CD44 < 2.22 ng/mL and protein
�1.23 mg/mL had borderline association with decreased PFS
(adjusted HR ¼ 3.446; 95% CI, 0.857–13.867; P ¼ 0.082) and
no significant difference in OS (adjusted HR ¼ 2.186; 95% CI,
0.524–9.123; P ¼ 0.284) compared with cases in the reference
group; however, this group included only 4 cases. As a result, the
data supports the markers indeed have potential to identify the
most aggressive forms of oral cancer.

controls were excluded because of bladder cancer and possible
oral premalignancy, respectively. The latter went on to develop
lung cancer. A subject from the community-based study classified
in an elevated risk category developed lung cancer 14 months
following testing.
Discussion
Despite over 550,000 new diagnoses of HNSCC worldwide
each year, few receive a skilled oral cancer screening exam. Early
diagnosis dramatically improves survival, but most present late.
This study describes a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive risk
assessment test based on salivary CD44 and protein that is able
to distinguish stage I–IV oral cancer cases from controls. Sensi-
tivity of early-stage lesions was as good or better (I–II ¼ 85%) than
identification of all stages combined (I–IV ¼ 80%). The finding
that early- and late-stage disease is detected is in keeping with
prior publications on salivary CD44 levels by this and other
groups (32, 42).
Also consistent with prior work, adding total protein
increases the accuracy of the test at very minimal cost (30).

 The relative protein and CD44 levels may greatly facilitate risk
stratification as these specific levels are associated with varying
risk, as indicated by the OR. This may enable clinicians to tailor
follow-up and patients to understand their risk better thus
motivating change. Further work must be done to determine
the cut-off points that characterize multiple risk levels across
diverse populations.
A strength of the study that adds to prior work is frequency
matching which ensures that there are no statistically significant
differences between cases and controls with respect to age, race,
gender, SES, tobacco use, or alcohol use. This ensures that the
biomarkers are associated with cancer risk and not some other
confounder such as tobacco use. We included additional covari-
ates in modeling to remove any residual confounding. Results
strongly support that CD44 and total protein are associated with
cancer risk independent of tobacco or alcohol use, age gender,
race, etc.
In frequency matching, a hospital-based control group was
chosen as the cases were also hospital-based and the goal was
to ensure that the cases and controls were as similar as possible
except for cancer status. While this minimizes confounding,
there are some limitations to this design as control subjects
from such clinics may not be representative of control subjects
recruited from the population (40). Indeed, over 10% of our
control population had a prior history of cancer. The EDRN
suggests that final conclusions should be based on population-
based studies, if possible (40). To begin to investigate the
markers in a population-based control group, we also enrolled
a target screening group of smokers from an underserved,
minority community population and followed them over
time. When we compared results with the cases from the
hospital-based study, specificity in the high-risk community
could reach as high as 95% after annual retesting, increasing
from 74% for a single initial test. Given that this population
had higher levels of tobacco and alcohol use, worse oral
health, and lower SES than the case group, this specificity is
quite high.
The study included a diverse population. We enrolled subjects
from a public institution that serves primarily unfunded patients
and includes a large percentage of Hispanic and African-American
minorities as well as a private academic institution that serves
mostly funded, white patients. Thus, we had ample minorities,
patients from low SES, and patients with poor oral health. This
further ensures that the markers will work in diverse populations
and limits potential confounding.
The study provides exploratory evidence that high salivary
CD44 is associated with poor PFS and OS. Thus, CD44 appears
to be associated with aggressive disease, although further study
would be needed to determine whether these markers are useful
for prognosis (43).
We performed preliminary analysis on CD44 and protein
levels in HPVþ versus HPV� cancer. Our data did not show a
significant difference in CD44 or protein levels between
HPVþ and HPV� subjects. We do not think it is related to
oral cavity cases that were HPVþ as there were only 4 of these
and the CD44 levels were not significantly different than the
oropharyngeal HPVþ samples. Protein levels were significant-
ly higher in the OP HPVþ compared with OC HPVþ subjects,
although the sample size was small. HPV status was unknown
in 39 of 91 of the oropharyngeal cases. This is a limitation of
the study thus further investigation is needed better under-
stand the relationship between CD44, total protein, and HPV
status.
Two false-positive control subjects developed HNSCC during
the follow-up period. Additional subjects with other smo-
king-associated tumors, including lung and bladder, also had
elevated CD44 levels. Thus, "false positives" could actually be
true positives for occult oral disease or other cancers. As CD44
is a tumor initiation factor, levels might go down if risk factors
decrease and occult lesions disappear. Data suggests that indi-
viduals who stayed in the community screening program for a
year underwent a significant decrease in CD44 levels not
attributable to technical differences in the test. All subjects
who stayed in the community screening program received
education on smoking cessation and access to resources to
assist them in improving oral hygiene and nutrition raising
the possibility that these prevention efforts may result in lower
marker levels and lower risk. However, more investigation is
needed to show this definitively.
This study assesses risk of oral cancer in that certain levels of
CD44 and protein are associated with elevated ORs and the OR for
relatively rare diseases like oral cancer approximates relative risk
(44). While the study does provide directional, anecdotal evi-
dence that certain levels of CD44 and protein may identify those
patients that will go on to develop cancer or precancer, the study
was not designed to assess leukoplakia or dysplasia or determine
whether these markers predict progression to invasive cancer.
Whether these markers predict progression is an area of consid-
erable interest that should be explored further in larger, prospec-
tive studies.
Conclusion
The results provided here are encouraging. Further investiga-
tions with larger sample sizes are needed to determine whether
marker levels vary with behavioral changes such as smoking
cessation, whether reversal of premalignant lesions is associated
with a drop in marker levels, and whether this test increases the
number of screen-detected oral cancer lesions. Success in any of
these areas could revolutionize oral cancer screening, by provid-
ing a simple and reliable measure of oral cancer risk that alerts
primary care providers, dentists, and other frontline screeners to
individuals most in need of skilled oral exam at a stage when the
process can be more easily treated or perhaps even reversed with
behavioral modification.
