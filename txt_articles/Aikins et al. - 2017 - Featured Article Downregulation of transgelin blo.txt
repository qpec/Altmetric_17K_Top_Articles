Impact statement
Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is an angio-
genic-independent mechanism of blood
vessel formation whereby aggressive
tumor cells undergo formation of capillary-
like structures. Thus, interventions aimed at
angiogenesis might not target the entire
tumor vasculature. A more holistic
approach is therefore needed in the devel-
opment of improved antivascular agents.
Transgelin, an actin-binding protein,
has been associated with multiple stages of
cancer development such as proliferation,
migration and invasion, but little is known
about its role in vasculogenic mimicry. We
present here, an additional mechanism by
which transgelin promotes malignancy by
way of its association with the occurrence
of VM. Although transgelin knockdown did
not affect the transcript levels of most of the
angiogenesis-related genes in this study, it
was associated with the inhibition of the
uptake of IL-8, accompanied by sup-
pressed VM, indicating that transgelin is
required for VM. These observations are
relevant to the future development of effi-
cient antivascular agents.
Abstract
Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a non-classical mechanism recently described in many
tumors, whereby cancer cells, rather than endothelial cells, form blood vessels.
Transgelin is an actin-binding protein that has been implicated in multiple stages of
cancer development. In this study, we investigated the role of transgelin in VM and assessed
its effect on the expression of endothelial and angiogenesis-related genes during VM in
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We confirmed the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to
undergo VM through a tube formation assay. Flow cytometry analysis revealed an increase
in the expression of the endothelial-related markers VE-cadherin and CD34 in cells that
underwent VM, compared with those growing in a monolayer, which was confirmed by
immunocytochemistry. We employed siRNA to silence transgelin, and knockdown effi-
ciency was determined by western blot analyses. Downregulation of transgelin suppressed
cell proliferation and tube formation, but increased IL-8 levels in Matrigel cultures. RT-PCR
analyses revealed that the expression of IL-8, VE-cadherin, and CD34 was unaffected by
transgelin knockdown, indicating that increased IL-8 expression was not due to enhanced
transcriptional activity. More importantly, the inhibition of IL-8/CXCR2 signaling also
resulted in suppression of VM with increased IL-8 levels, confirming that increased IL-8
levels after transgelin knockdown was due to inhibition of IL-8 uptake. Our findings indicate
that transgelin regulates VM by enhancing IL uptake. These observations are relevant to the
future development of efficient antivascular agents.

Introduction
Adequate blood supply is crucial for tumor growth and
survival, as it ensures delivery of oxygen and nutrients,
without which the tumor cannot grow beyond a certain
size.1 Angiogenesis, the process by which blood vessels
are formed from the pre-existing vasculature, is a conven-
tional mechanism exploited by tumors to facilitate growth,
and is a well-recognized hallmark of cancer.2 This process
has been shown to play a role in growth and metastasis in
malignancies such as breast cancer, which is the most
commonly diagnosed cancer in women.3,4 Hence, targeting
angiogenesis is considered a major therapeutic strategy for
the treatment of tumors; however, recent studies have
shown that angiogenesis-independent pathways such as
vasculogenic mimicry (VM) are also employed by tumors
to ensure adequate nourishment.5
Maniotis et al. were the first to describe VM in melanoma,
and subsequent in vivo and in vitro studies reported this
process in glioblastomas, breast, ovarian, and head and
neck carcinomas.5,6 VM refers to the ability of tumor cells
to adopt properties of endothelial cells and form mosaic

 structures that can provide a blood supply for the tumor
in vivo. In three-dimensional cultures in vitro, this process is
recapitulated by the formation of tubular structures and
patterned networks. VM is usually observed in high-
grade invasive tumors, is associated with poor prognosis,
and might be partly responsible for resistance to antiangio-
genic drugs.7–9 Indeed, a number of studies revealed that
angiogenesis inhibitors did not significantly affect VM, thus
underscoring the need for improved antivascular therapies
that specifically target VM.6,10,11
Transgelin (also known as SM22a and TAGLN) is an
early marker of smooth muscle cell differentiation and is
an actin-binding protein that affects cytoskeletal dynamics
by stabilizing actin filaments. The association between
transgelin and the cytoskeleton accounts for its involve-
ment in cancer-related processes such as proliferation,
migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Transgelin-mediated
effects have been implicated in the pathogenesis of colorec-
tal, stomach, pancreas, prostate, kidney, and bladder
tumors. Moreover, differential expression of transgelin has
been associated with poor prognoses in certain cases.
Importantly, Lee et al. showed that transgelin enhanced
migration and invasion of cancer stem cells (CSCs).12–14 In
addition, Rao et al. described transgelin as a potentially
useful diagnostic marker, based on its differential expres-
sion in triple negative (TN) and non-TN breast cancers.15
A number of studies suggest that transgelin might
have diverse roles in vessel formation. For example, co-
expression and co-localization of transgelin and the chemo-
kine receptor CXCR4, which is implicated in angiogenesis
and breast cancer metastasis, have been reported.13,16,17
In contrast, Nair et al. found that transgelin repressed metal-
loproteinase (MMP)-9 expression, a pro-angiogenic factor
and mediator of VM.9,18,19 Furthermore, transgelin-2, a
cytoskeletal protein and a transgelin homolog that is also
differentially expressed in some tumors, was shown to par-
ticipate in lovastatin-induced antiangiogenic effects in
endothelial cells.20,21 Although a large number of studies
have addressed the role of transgelin in tumorigenesis,
there is paucity of information regarding the impact of
transgelin on angiogenesis and VM.
In this study, we investigated the effect of transgelin on
VM and the expression of angiogenesis-related genes in
breast cancer cells.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
Human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7,
were purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul,
Korea).
Cells
were
cultured
in
Dulbecco’s
modified
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Gibco-Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 100
U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Cells were
incubated at 37�C in a humidified atmosphere and in the
presence of 5% CO2. Cells plated in Matrigel-coated wells
were recovered using Cell Recovery Solution (Corning,
Tewksbury,
MA)
following
the
manufacturer’s
recommendations.
Flow cytometry
The FACS Calibur was used for analyses of cell surface
markers. Monolayer cultures were harvested by trypsiniza-
tion, and cells grown on Matrigel were recovered using Cell
Recovery solution (Corning), according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. The cells were washed with PBS con-
taining 2% FBS (wash buffer), and were then resuspended
at a density of 106 cells/100 mL of PBS containing 1% FBS.
The suspensions were incubated at 4�C in the dark for
30 min in the presence of indicated antibodies, using con-
centrations recommended by the manufacturers. Labeled
cells were washed first with PBS containing 1% FBS and
then with wash buffer. Monoclonal antibodies against
human CD44 (FITC-labeled) and CD24 (PE-labeled) were
obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). Antibodies
against CD34 (FITC-labeled), VEGFR2 (Alexa Fluor 547-
labeled), and VE-Cadherin (APC-conjugated) were pur-
chased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA).
Tube formation assay
We coated m-plate angiogenesis 96-well plates (Ibidi GmbH,
Germany) with 10 mL/well of Corning Matrigel growth
factor reduced (GFR) Basement Membrane Matrix, and
incubated the plates for 30 min at 37�C, as per instructions
provided by the manufacturer. Cells grown as monolayers
were trypsinized, and re-plated at a density of 1.25 � 104
cells/well on Matrigel-coated wells. When 24-well plates
were used, we coated each well with 150 mL of Matrigel
and seeded 1.5 � 105 cells/well. For fluorescence imaging,
cultures were washed with HBSS and cells were stained
with Calcein AM (Corning), according to the manu-
facturer’s
protocol.
To
assess
quantitative
differences
among individual cell groups, we determined total tube
length, using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA).
Immunocytochemical studies involving immunofluor-
escence and confocal microscopy
Approximately 10 h after plating, cultures in m-plate angio-
genesis 96-well plates were washed with cold PBS and
fixed with cold methanol for 10 min. Cells were then per-
meabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100, blocked with 5% BSA,
and labeled with Alexa Fluor 594-VE-cadherin or FITC-
CD34 antibodies. After 1 h of incubation, the cells were
counterstained with DAPI for 20 min. Washing was per-
formed three times for 5 min after each step. Images were
acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope, LSM
700 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
Transfection
For small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies, we seeded
cells one day before transfection in six-well plates at a
density of 1.8 � 105 cells/well. Cells were then transfected
with either scrambled (control) siRNA (UGGUUUACAUG
UCGACUAA) or siRNA targeting transgelin (CCAAAAUC
GAGAAGAAGUAUU) (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA),
using Dharmafect 4 transfection reagent (Dharmacon),
according to instructions provided by the manufacturer.

 Approximately 6 h after transfection, the culture medium
was replaced with fresh medium. For RT-PCR analyses,
total RNA was extracted 24 h after transfection. For all
other assays, cells were cultured for 48 h and were then
trypsinized and used in subsequent studies, or lysed as
described below; lysates were subjected to further analyses.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and cDNA was synthesized from
1 mg of total RNA, using the ReverTra Ace� quantitative
reverse transcription PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Japan) in
accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions. PCR pri-
mers were from Cosmogenetech (Seoul, Korea). Target
regions were amplified using the primers listed in Table 1.
PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and
detected using EtBr with a BioRad Molecular Imager�
GelDocTM XR. For all RT-PCR analysis, b-actin was used
as the loading control.
Western blot analyses
Cultured cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) with a 1% protein inhibitor cocktail. Total
protein levels were assessed using the Bradford assay.
Aliquots (10 mg) were then subjected to electrophoresis on
12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Resolved proteins were
transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes,
and membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat
dried milk. The membranes were then incubated with a
1:1000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) or a 1: 4000 dilution
of
rabbit
polyclonal
antitransgelin
antibody
(Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) at 4�C overnight. Blots were incubated
with
goat
antimouse
or
goat
antirabbit
horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) for 1 h at room temperature.
Blots were developed using an enhanced chemilumines-
cence detection kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) to visual-
ize immunoreactive bands. GAPDH was used as a loading
control.
CCK-8 proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was determined using a cell counting kit
(CCK-8, Dojindo, Japan) following the recommendations
provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were seeded
on 96-well plates at a density of 3000 cells/well and allowed
to adhere overnight. The cells were then transfected with
control or targeted siRNAs or treated with the CXCR2
inhibitor, SB225002. At the indicated time points, cck-8
reagent was added (10 mL/well), and the plates were incu-
bated in the dark for 2 h at 37�C. The optical densities were
read at 450 nm using a 96-well plate reader. Assays were
performed in replicates of six.
ELISA
Culture supernatants from cells grown on 24-well plates
were collected 10 h after plating, and maintained at �80�C
until further use. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels in the super-
natants were quantified using the IL-8 Quantikine ELISA
kit, (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufac-
turer’s recommendations.
CXCR2 inhibition assay
SB225002 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, from Sigma-Aldrich). Cells
were treated with SB225002s at the indicated final concen-
trations and with the specified incubation conditions. Cells
or culture supernatants were harvested 10 h post-treatment
for further analysis.
Statistical analyses
Data are presented as the mean � standard deviation.
All experiments were performed at least three independent
times. A student’s t-test was performed to compare dif-
ferences between groups. Statistical significance was set at
P < 0.05. Data analysis was performed using the SigmaStat
3.5 statistical software package.
Results
MDA-MB-231 cells have a high proportion of cancer
stem cells and are VM-competent
CSCs have been associated with the occurrence of VM.22–24
FACS analysis to assess the proportion of CD44þ/CD24�
CSCs revealed that greater than 90% (94.3% � 1.8) of the
MDA-MB-231 cell population was composed of CSCs; this
high proportion of CSCs is a characteristic of basal cell lines.
The observation that the majority of cells in the MDA-
MB-231 cell line have stem-like properties was in agreement
with previous reports.25,26 However, we did not detect a
CD44þ/CD24� subpopulation in MCF-7 cells; this was
comparable to the findings of other studies that reported
CSC proportions of 0–3% for this cell line. MCF-7 cell popu-
lations rather had a high proportion (approximately 99%) of

Downregulation of transgelin suppresses vasculogenic mimicry

 CD24þ cells, consistent with its luminal characteristics
(Figure 1(a) and (b)).25,26
Next, we assessed tube formation in MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7 cell lines. Previous studies showed that the highly
invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, but not the poorly invasive
MCF-7 cells, form tube-like structures27; our studies con-
firmed
these
findings.
Although
MDA-MB-231
and
MCF-7 cells were cultured under identical experimental
conditions, it was observed that MDA-MB-231 cells devel-
oped capillary-like networks; however MCF-7 cells formed
clusters on Matrigel surfaces (Figure 1(c)). These data sug-
gest that the vasculogenic properties of breast cancer cells
are due to their inherent phenotypic properties and
possibly related to the stem-like nature of the cells, in agree-
ment with findings in other tumors.23
MDA-MB-231 cells express VE-cadherin in both
monolayer and Matrigel cultures but express CD34
only in Matrigel cultures
Previous studies with ovarian CSCs have shown that VM
is accompanied by the expression of VE-cadherin, an endo-
thelial
marker
and
CD34,
an
endothelial
progenitor
marker22; however, to our knowledge, no studies have
determined whether this is also a feature of breast cancer
cells. We assessed the expression of the endothelial markers
VE-cadherin, CD34, and VEGFR2 in breast cancer cells
grown as monolayers and compared the results to those
obtained using cells grown on Matrigel that had undergone
VM. FACS analyses revealed that there was increased cell
surface
expression
of
VE-cadherin
(�5%)
and
CD34
(�20%), and a negligible increase of VEGFR2þ cells, follow-
ing growth on Matrigel compared with monolayer cultures
(Figure 2(a) to (c)). Further analyses by immunocytochem-
istry showed that VE-cadherin was expressed at the
cytoplasmic level in both monolayer and Matrigel cultures,
whereas CD34 was expressed only in Matrigel cultures
(Figure 2(d) to (f)). Taken together, our results indicate
that MDA-MB-231 cells have the ability to acquire increased
endothelial characteristics during VM, and that CD34 and
VE-cadherin might be required for this process.
Proliferation and VM are suppressed by transgelin
knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells
Transgelin is a cytoskeletal protein implicated in a variety of
cancer-related processes such as cell proliferation, migra-
tion, invasion, and metastasis.12 To investigate the role
of transgelin in VM, we employed siRNA-based silencing
approaches
and
confirmed
efficient
knockdown
of
transgelin through western blot and densitometry analyses
(Figure 3(a) and (b)). We determined the effect of transgelin
knockdown on proliferation and found a modest (�10%)
but statistically significant reduction in the growth of trans-
gelin-depleted cells compared with that of control cell popu-
lations (P < 0.05, Figure 3(c)). More importantly, decreasing
transgelin expression significantly reduced the ability of
cancer
cells
to
form
tube-like
structures
(P < 0.001).
Specifically, whereas control cells typically developed com-
plete loops, transgelin silencing was associated with frag-
mentation of capillary-like networks formed by the cells
(Figure 3(d) and (e)). Taken together, these data suggest
that transgelin is required for both cell proliferation and
tube formation.
Effect of transgelin knockdown on the levels of
angiogenesis-related and endothelial markers
Next, we investigated the effect of transgelin knockdown on
the expression of VE-Cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells grown

Confocal microscopy images were acquired using an LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with a 10 � objective and using 70 � magnification. Cells seeded on
Matrigel-coated 24-well plates were stained with calcein AM approximately 10 h after plating. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)

 as monolayers versus cells that had developed vascular net-
works in response to growth on Matrigel. Flow cytometry
analyses revealed that VE-cadherin expression increased
following growth on Matrigel regardless of transgelin
expression (Figure 4(a) and (b)).
IL-8 (CXCL8) is a chemokine known to promote tumor
angiogenesis and metastasis.28 A number of studies have
linked tumor IL-8 expression to proliferation, migration,
invasion, and angiogenesis.29 In addition, IL-8 signaling is
known to affect MMP-2, which has been implicated

 in VM.9,18,19 Moreover, the highly invasive MDA-MB-231
cells are known to secrete IL-8.30,31 We determined the
levels of IL-8 secreted by cells grown as monolayers and
on Matrigel, and assessed the impact of transgelin on this
process. ELISA data (Figure 4(c)) showed that IL-8 secretion
was generally lower in cultures with a more prominent vas-
cular network, in agreement with previous studies on ovar-
ian cancer cells.22 Indeed, secretion of IL-8 by highly invasive
MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly higher when cells were
grown as monolayers compared with that in Matrigel cul-
tures that typically develop VM (P ¼ 0.045). In addition,
transgelin knockdown, which decreased vasculogenic activ-
ity in cells grown on Matrigel, led to significantly higher IL-8
levels compared with that in control Matrigel cultures
(P ¼ 0.034) (Figure 4(c)). Thus, the data are consistent with
a model, whereby IL-8 participates in transgelin-regulated
autocrine signaling events required for VM.
Subsequently, we determined whether downregulation
of transgelin affected the expression of IL-8 and endothelial
markers at the mRNA level. We could not detect changes in
the transcript levels of IL-8 and VE-cadherin by RT-PCR
analysis, whereas we found VEGFR2 expression was
slightly
downregulated
by
knockdown
of
transgelin
(Figure 4(d)), confirming that transgelin is not directly asso-
ciated with the expression of IL-8 and VE-cadherin. We
could not detect expression of CD34 in both the control
(siCtrl) and transgelin knockdown (siTagln) monolayer
samples, confirming that monolayer cultures of MDA-
MB-231 cells do not express CD34 (data not shown).
Taken together, our results indicate that MDA-MB-231
cells have the ability to acquire endothelial characteristics
independent of transgelin during VM.
Blocking CXCR2 receptor signaling impairs
proliferation and VM and leads to increased IL-8 levels
Apart from expressing IL-8, MDA-MB-231 cells have also
been reported to express its cognate receptors CXCR1/
CXCR2. In addition, autocrine IL-8/receptor signaling
during the growth of TN breast cancer cells, including
MDA-MB-231, is well established.32 CXCR2 is known
to act as a scavenger for its ligands, and as such,

 blocking CXCR2 can lead to increased ligand levels.33
We hypothesized that decreased IL-8 levels during VM
was due to enhanced IL-8/CXCR2 autocrine signaling.
To verify that decreased levels in IL-8 during VM formation
was due to uptake by MDA-MB-231 cells, we blocked IL-8
uptake through CXCR2 by treating the cells with SB225002,
a selective non-peptide CXCR2 antagonist, with >150-fold
selectivity for CXCR2 over CXCR1.28 Treatment with the
CXCR2 inhibitor resulted in morphological changes to
cells in monolayer culture, wherein cells lost their spin-
dle-like morphology and became more rounded, in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 5(a)). Consistent with stu-
dies in other cancer cells, SB225002 inhibited prolifer-
ation of cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Figure 5(b)).34,35 As expected, SB225002 inhibited tube
formation in a dose-dependent fashion, with a statistical
significance of P < 0.001 at 100 nM; no tube formation was
observed at a concentration of 1000 nM, and more import-
antly, this correlated with increased IL-8 levels (Figure 5(c)
to (e)). The concentration of IL-8 in monolayer cultures also
increased with increasing doses of the SB225002 suggesting
a correlation between IL-8 uptake and normal cellular func-
tions such as proliferation (Figure 5(e)). Altogether, the data
confirmed an increase in IL-8 uptake during VM formation
in an autocrine manner and that IL-8/CXCR2 signaling was
necessary
for
tube
formation,
which
correlated
with
increased IL-8 levels.
Discussion
VM, the ability of tumor cells to undergo vessel formation
de novo, has been described in multiple cancers (reviewed in

 Fan et al.6). Findings from previous studies show that VM is
associated with aggressive tumors and poor patient prog-
noses. Breast tumors lacking expression of estrogen, proges-
terone, and HER2 receptors, commonly referred to as TN,
are known for their high aggressiveness.9,36 Kaplan-Meier
analyses have shown lower overall survival for TN breast
cancer
patients
compared
with
non-TN
groups.9,37
Importantly, VM was proportionately higher in TN breast
cancers than in tumors classified as luminal types A and B.
Similar to previous studies, our results show that TN
MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit VM, whereas MCF-7 cells do
not, possibly reflecting differences in the malignant proper-
ties of tumors from which these cells were derived.27 Our
FACS analyses revealed that CSCs accounted for greater
than 90% of the MDA-MB-231 population, in contrast to
MCF-7 cells, which had 0% CSCs; this was comparable to
results of other studies.25,26
The sharp contrast in CSC subpopulation content
observed when we compared the two cell lines might also
account for differences in vasculogenic properties, since
CSCs, described as a tumor cell population characterized
by chemoresistance, the ability to initiate tumors, and self-
renewal,
have
been
found
to
be
involved
in
VM.6
For instance, Alvero et al. reported that the CSC subpopula-
tion of ovarian tumor cells, but not non-stem cells, could
contribute to tumor neovascularization through VM.22
In addition, studies on other forms of malignancies, includ-
ing glioblastoma, also provided support for CSC-mediated
VM.23,24 Thus, our data are consistent with findings
from others pointing to a strong relationship between VM
and CSCs.
Understanding both similarities and differences between
VM and angiogenesis would be beneficial for the develop-
ment of antivascular chemotherapeutic agents. Studies by
Alvero et al. showed that ovarian cancer cells that had
undergone
VM
expressed
endothelial-related
markers
such as CD34 and VE-cadherin.22 Similarly, Liu et al.
reported that holoclone cells that had VM capabilities
expressed VE-cadherin, MMP-2, and MMP-9.9 Findings
from the present study also showed that the endothelial
progenitor marker CD34 as well as VE-cadherin were
expressed by cells that had undergone VM.
Indeed, VE-cadherin, a cell–cell adhesion molecule origin-
ally found on endothelial cells, is also expressed by invasive
melanoma and some breast cancer cells.38–40 Expression of
VE-cadherin has also been implicated in VM in hepatocarci-
noma cells wherein reduced expression (resulting from
knockdown of TWIST) led to decreased VM.41
CD34 is an endothelial cell and hematopoietic stem cell
progenitor marker implicated in lumen formation during
angiogenesis. Previous work reported that CD34þ cells
migrate to, proliferate, and participate in capillary forma-
tion and, with CD34� cells, enhance tube formation in
three-dimensional matrices. These results suggested that
administration of CD34þ-enriched cells might significantly
improve neovascularization.42,43 The first step in lumen for-
mation involves endothelial cell–cell adhesion. Studies
focused on the development of mouse aortas showed that
CD34-sialomucins, along with moesin and F-actin, localize
to endothelial cell-to-cell contact points, and that VE-cad-
herin is necessary for localization of CD34.44,45 These obser-
vations could account for the enhanced expression of CD34
and VE-cadherin during VM in our studies.
Transgelin is an actin-binding protein associated with
cancer-related processes such as proliferation, migration,
invasion, and metastasis. Differential transgelin expression
has been associated with multiple tumors, but there are
conflicting
reports

its
impact

disease

 progression. For example, some studies reported transgelin
downregulation in colorectal and breast carcinomas.46,47
In contrast, others found positive correlations between
transgelin expression and malignancy in hepatocarcinoma,
breast, and colorectal cancers, among others. Lee et al. also
demonstrated that transgelin expression was higher in
CSCs and that it promoted migration and invasiveness,
thus enhancing metastasis in hepatocarcinoma. In a recent
study, transgelin was shown to be more highly expressed in
TN breast cancer samples compared with that in luminal-
type
tumors,
suggesting
its
association
with
malig-
nancy.13,15,48 These findings, combined with the observation
that VM was highest among TN cancer patients, suggest
positive correlations between transgelin and VM in breast
tumors. This possibility is supported by our observation
that siRNA-mediated knockdown of transgelin inhibited
the proliferative and vasculogenic properties of breast
cancer cells.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been
implicated in VM.24 Lin et al. reported that transgelin down-
regulation resulted in a reduction in the expression of some
EMT markers such as vimentin and fibronectin-1.13,15,48
Thus, one of the possible mechanisms through which trans-
gelin affects VM is via EMT. Future studies are required to
elucidate the mechanisms through which transgelin is
involved in VM, and to further evaluate these relationships
in animal models of breast cancer and in human tumor
samples.
IL-8 expression in breast cancer cells is strongly corre-
lated with invasiveness and is inversely linked to estrogen
receptor (ER) status. IL-8 is expressed and secreted by
ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells but is essentially undetect-
able in ER-positive MCF-7 cells. In addition, silencing of
IL-8 in breast cancer cells inhibited invasion.35 MDA-
MB-231 cells have also been reported to express the cognate
receptors for IL-8 CXCR1/CXCR2.32
Our studies revealed decreased levels of IL-8 in Matrigel-
cultured
cells
that
underwent
tube
formation,
when
compared with that in monolayer cultures. In addition,
silencing transgelin, which impaired VM in Matrigel cul-
tures, increased IL-8 levels. Furthermore, inhibiting IL-8/
CXCR2 signaling resulted in the inhibition of VM, which
was accompanied by increased IL-8 levels in conditioned
medium. Indeed IL-8/CXCR2 signaling has been reported
to be involved in proliferation, invasion, and cancer pro-
gression.35 However, to the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study reporting the effect of inhibiting IL-8/CXCR2
signaling on VM. Since IL-8 is known to have autocrine and
paracrine signaling properties, our data provide strong evi-
dence for the role of IL-8/CXCR2 autocrine signaling
during VM.49
CXCR2 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that has been
found to be associated with tumor proliferation, progression,
and invasion. The selective non-peptide CXCR2 antagonist,
SB225002, also known as (N-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)-N0-
(2-bromophenyl) urea), acts by inhibiting the binding of
IL-8
to
CXCR2.50,51
From
our
data,
treatment
with
SB225002 inhibited proliferation and VM, which was corre-
lated with increased IL-8 levels.
A number of signaling pathways, including the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR, PLC/PKC, and MAPK/ERK axes, are acti-
vated following IL-8-mediated engagement of its recep-
tors.28 Some of these pathways, such as PI3K/Akt and
ERK have been associated with VM.24 Thus, the inhibition
of CXCR2 likely affects VM through these signaling path-
ways. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the
mechanisms by which IL-8/CXCR2 contributes to tube for-
mation in cancer cells.
In conclusion, our work shows that transgelin downre-
gulation impairs the vasculogenic abilities of breast cancer
cells and might interfere with IL-8 signaling during this
process. We also report that MDA-MB-231 cells have the
ability to acquire endothelial characteristics during tube
formation and that this might be independent of transgelin
expression. Few studies have investigated whether transge-
lin affects the vascular properties of tumor cells. Thus, our
findings represent an additional mechanism, whereby
transgelin contributes to the malignancy of cancer cells.
Additional studies are necessary to dissect the molecular
mechanisms whereby transgelin regulates VM; such studies
have the potential to favorably impact the future develop-
ment of effective antivascular cancer therapeutics.
