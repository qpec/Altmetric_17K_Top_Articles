ABSTRACT
Objective: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive, treatment-resistant
cancer. Pemetrexed, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS), is used worldwide for MPM as a first-
line chemotherapy regimen. However, there is little consensus for a second-line chemotherapy. S-1,
a highly effective dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)-inhibitory fluoropyrimidine, mainly acts
via a TS inhibitory mechanism similar to pemetrexed. Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) is a
key enzyme related to the first step activation of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for inhibiting RNA synthesis.
We investigated 5-FU related-metabolism proteins, especially focusing on OPRT expression, in MPM
Methods and Patients: Fifteen MPM patients who were diagnosed between July 2004 and
December 2013 were enrolled. We examined the protein levels of 5-FU metabolism-related
enzymes (TS, DPD, OPRT, and thymidine phosphorylase [TP]) in 14 cases Results: High TS, DPD,
OPRT, and TP expressions were seen in 28.6%, 71.4%, 85.7%, and 35.7% of patients, respectively. We
found that OPRT expression was extremely high in MPM tissue. We experienced one remarkable
case of highly effective S-1 combined therapy for pemetrexed refractory MPM. This case also
showed high OPRT protein expression Conclusion: The present study suggests that OPRT
expression is high in MPM tumors. Although pemetrexed is mainly used for MPM chemotherapy as
a TS inhibitor, S-1 has potential as an anticancer drug not only as a TS inhibitor but also inhibiting
RNA synthesis through the OPRT pathway. This is the first report investigating OPRT protein
expressions in MPM.

Introduction
MPM is a rare malignancy that is mainly localized to
the pleura. Asbestos exposure is the dominant etiolog-
ical agent, with a latency period of 20-40 y. Recently
in Japan, the incidence of MPM has been increasing.
This is a reflection of the use of asbestos during the
1970s to the mid-1990s. The maximum number of
MPM cases is expected to reach approximately 1700
per year by 2010 to 2015.1 A previous clinical trial sug-
gested that treatment with pemetrexed plus cisplatin
and vitamin supplementation resulted in superior sur-
vival in first-line treatment for patients with MPM.2,3
Numerous targeted agents have been tried in small
studies in salvage settings, but none have been granted
approval.3,4 There are no randomized trials showing
any survival benefit beyond the 2nd line setting, and
the definitive optional regimen is not known.5
Among potential candidates, S-1 (TS-1; Taiho
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) is an antican-
cer agent for TS inhibition. S-1 is an oral fluoropyri-
midine agent that consists of tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-
dihydroxypyridine, and potassium oxonate in a molar
ratio of 1:0.4:1.6,7 There have been a few large clinical
trials for S-1 for lung cancer. Okamoto et al. reported
noninferiority of carboplatin and S-1 compared with
carboplatin and paclitaxel in terms of overall sur-
vival.8,9 There have been no S-1 trials reported for
MPM.

 However, pemetrexed, an antifolate anticancer
drug, is widely used for MPM treatment. Both S-1 and
pemetrexed exhibit their main anti-tumor activity
through TS inhibition via a similar mechanism. How-
ever, an OPRT-related pathway that leads to RNA
synthesis inhibition is also thought to be an important
mechanism for S-1.10-12
The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the
OPRT expression which is a potential prognostic indi-
cator of S-1 treatment, for MPM. During this study,
we experienced one pemetrexed-refractory MPM case
that dramatically responded to S-1 treatment, which
also showed high OPRT expression.
Materials and methods
Patients’ characteristics
The study included all patients who were diagnosed
with
MPM
at
National
Hospital
Organization
National Disaster Medical Center in Tokyo, Japan
between July 2004 and December 2013. Analysis of
tumor samples, which were available after routine
diagnostic histopathological workup, provided ade-
quate pretreatment biopsies from 15 patients. The
study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics
committee (No. TDMC2013-8/2013).
The characteristics of the study population are sum-
marized in Table 1. The age of the patients ranged from
41 to 87 y (median age, 68). Disease staging was
assessed
according
to
International
Mesothelioma
Interesting Group Tumor Node Metastasis (IMIG
TNM) staging criteria.13 All tumors were assessed using
the modified Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) cri-
teria.14 According to IMIG TNM classification, 11 were
in stage III/IV and two were stage I. Of these patients,
13 received pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. Three
underwent
surgical
treatment:
two
received
EPP
(extrapleural pneumonectomy) and the other P/D
(pleurectomy/decortication). These surgical patients
also received pemetrexed-based chemotherapy after
recurrence. One patient was excluded from further
studies because tissue specimens were not available. For
the pathological type,15 five were epithelioid mesotheli-
oma type, four were sarcomatoid type mesothelioma
(all four were diagnosed as desmoplastic type), and
three were biphasic type mesothelioma. The remaining
three cases were diagnosed only as MPM because of dif-
ficulty to classify.
Fifteen patients with MPM were treated with che-
motherapy; nine received pemetrexed plus carbopla-
tin, two received pemetrexed plus cisplatin, one
received
gemcitabine
plus
carboplatin,
and
one
received pemetrexed alone. Two patients requiring
palliative care did not receive chemotherapy.
Immunohistochemical staining

 controls were sections of colonic adenocarcinoma
for TS, lung adenocarcinoma for DPD, squamous
cell lung carcinoma for OPRT, and breast ductal
carcinoma for TP.
Two investigators (A.T. and S.K.) with no previous
knowledge of the clinicopathological characteristics
assessed immunostained sections. Positive expression of
TS, OPRT, DPD, and TP was identified if nuclear or cyto-
plasmic staining was present. The percentage of positive
tumor cells was analyzed using a semiquantitative score
as follows: 1, <10 %; 2, 10–25%; 3, 26–50%; 4, 51–75%;
5, >75 %.18 Tumors in which stained cells made up more
than 25% of the tumor were graded as highly positive.
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple com-
parison tests was used for statistical analysis to determine
the immunohistochemical staining score. The Kaplan-
Meier method was used to estimate survival as a function
of time, and survival differences were analyzed by the
log-rank test. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the
time between the start of chemotherapy and death from
any cause. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP
10 (SAS, Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) for Mac and sta-
tistical significance was set a P value of 0.05.
Results
Between July 2004 and December 2013, 15 patients
consecutively diagnosed for MPM were enrolled.
Immunohistochemical analysis
We evaluated immunohistochemical staining using a
semi-quantitative scoring method. Of 15 patients, 14
samples were available for 5-FU-related metabolic
enzyme staining and analysis. TS, OPRT, and TP were
expressed in the nuclei and/or cytoplasm of the tumor
cells, and DPD consistently showed cytoplasmic stain-
ing (Fig. 1).
Average scores of TS, DPD, OPRT, and TP were 1.9
(standard error D 0.3), 3.5 (0.5), 4.2 (0.3), and 2.6
(0.5), respectively (Table 1). OPRT protein expression
was much higher compared to the other 5-FU metabo-
lism-related proteins in MPM. As compared to TS pro-
tein expression, OPRT was more than twice as high.
High expression (defined as >25 % stained cells) was
seen for TS, DPD, OPRT, and TP in 28.6%(4/14), 71.4%
(10/14), 85.7%(12/14), and 35.7%(5/14) of tumors,
respectively. Positive rates of expression of each protein
according to clinicopathological factors are shown in
Table 2. TS protein tended to be expressed more strongly
for older patients. Low TS expression patients (n D 10)
all had high OPRT protein expression. For high DPD
protein expression (n D 10), 9 patients tended to have
high OPRT protein expression (Table 2).
Survival analysis for pemetrexed-based treatment
Of 15 patients, 14 had adequate samples available for
TS, DPD, OPRT, and TP analysis. Twelve patients
were treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy.
Using the semi-quantitative scoring method, samples
were classified as having “high” or “low” TS, DPD,
OPRT, or TP protein expression (Table 2). We found a
significant association between high and low TS and
DPD expression and survival time (P D 0.029, P D
0.0067 respectively). However, we did not reveal any
other significant associations between other parameters.

 Dramatic response to S-1 treatment of an MPM case
and OPRT protein expression
A 66-year-old male with unresectable MPM was admit-
ted to our hospital for fourth-line treatment. The patient
was diagnosed with MPM on September 2009. A chest
computed tomography scan at the initial time revealed a
mass extending to the pleura with pleural effusion that
was predominantly on the upper mediastinal side. Under
thoracoscopy, a pleural biopsy of a pleural thickening
mass was pathologically compatible for MPM. Immuno-
histochemical analysis showed that the tumor cells were
positive for calretinin. The findings were consistent with
a diagnosis of MPM, stage IV.
The patient was treated with multiple chemother-
apy regimens according to the modified Southwest
Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria. The first-line che-
motherapy was four cycles of cisplatin plus peme-
trexed. The tumor regrew after the first treatment,
necessitating additional treatment. A similar four
cycles of carboplatin plus pemetrexed was chosen, and
15 cycles of pemetrexed maintenance was applied after
combination therapy. However, the tumor regrew
again and the patient was treated with carboplatin and
gemcitabine as a third-line chemotherapy. Three
months after the third-line chemotherapy, pleural
thickening was again found. Therefore, S-1 and carbo-
platin salvage combination therapy was administered.
We obtained informed consent. The patient received
carboplatin (AUC,5) on day 1 plus oral S-1 (40 mg/m2
twice per day) on days 1 to 14. Chemotherapy was
repeated every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles
unless there was earlier evidence of disease progres-
sion or treatment intolerance. In regards to tumor
response, the pleural thickening dramatically shrank
in size (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemical staining of TS,
OPRT, DPD, and TP showed 1C, 5C, 5C, and 1C
scores, respectively.
Grade 4 anemia appeared, which required transfu-
sion since the patient had undergone many courses of

treatment, the patient remains well and maintains a
partial response status.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the
presence of OPRT protein expression in MPM. We
found that OPRT protein in mesothelioma tumor tis-
sue was significantly higher compared to other 5-FU
metabolic-related enzymes.
MPM is an aggressive, treatment-resistant cancer
that is increasing in frequency throughout the world.
Median survival is now 12 months from diagnosis.19
The current standard of care for first-line systemic
therapy in patients with unresectable MPM is combi-
nation
chemotherapy
with
pemetrexed
and
cis-
platin.2,3 However, there is no current standard of care
for second-line chemotherapy due to insufficient evi-
dence. We documented a remarkable response with S-
1 combination therapy for pemetrexed-refractory
MPM in one patient.
S-1 has been reported to be effective in the treat-
ment of various solid tumors, including gastric cancer,
colon cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.8,20 We
previously reported successful S-1 treatment for
refractory thymic carcinoma with high OPRT expres-
sion.10 The anticancer activity of 5-FU has been
reported to be closely related to the intratumoral
expression of TS and DPD in lung cancer.11 We have
also hypothesized that strong OPRT expression may
be a predictive biomarker for S-1 therapy. There are a
few papers describing TS and DPD expression in
MPM.21-23 Therefore, we took interest in 5-FU
related-metabolic proteins, especially OPRT, in meso-
thelioma. As a result, we found high OPRT expression
in MPM cells, which might be a predictive biomarker
for S-1 treatment.
5-FU exerts its antitumor effect primarily through
the inhibition of DNA synthesis. However, the mecha-
nism of its anti-tumor effect also occurs through dys-
function
of
RNA
synthesis.
The
hypothesized
mechanism underlying its inhibition of DNA and
RNA is shown in Figure 3.
The first mechanism of action is to inhibit DNA
synthesis. In vivo, 5-FU is converted to its active form,
5-fluoro-20-deoxyuridine-50-monophosphate
(FdUMP).6 Then, with reduced folic acid as a coen-
zyme, it strongly binds with TS, which catalyzes the
synthesis of thymidine necessary for DNA synthesis,
forming a tripartite complex.18 This reduces the activ-
ity of TS, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. However,
when TS is highly expressed in tumor tissues, DNA
synthesis occurs due to the residual excess TS, and the
antitumor effect of 5-FU is attenuated. TS expression
in the tumor tissues of various solid cancers has been
investigated and has been found to be lower in lung
cancer than in other cancers.20 In view of the above,
though 5-FU should be effective against most lung
cancers based on its expression patterns, its efficacy is
actually poor. A proposed reason for this is that,
although 5-FU is activated in vivo, it is rapidly broken
down by DPD, a 5-FU-degrading enzyme.24 Further-
more, in cancer types with high intratumoral levels of
DPD activity, 5-FU is rapidly degraded and its efficacy
is decreased. DPD activity has been reported to be at
least two-fold higher in lung carcinoma than in gastric
and colon cancers.20 Therefore, when 5-FU is used to
treat carcinoma types with high DPD activity levels,
inhibition of DPD is considered to be essential, and
this realization led to the development of S-1, which
contains gimeracil (CDHP; 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxy-
pyridine). We also found high DPD expression in
mesothelioma tissues, but theologically, S-1, which
contains CHDP, a DPD inhibitor, may have an anti-
cancer effect in tumors with high DPD expression.
The second mechanism of action of 5-FU is the
inhibition of RNA function, which is mediated by the
conversion of OPRT to fluorouridine monophosphate
(FUMP) by a phosphorylating enzyme. Investigation
of OPRT expression in lung cancer has shown that it
is at least two-fold higher in squamous cell carcinoma
than in adenocarcinoma.20 It can be surmised that S-1
exerts an antitumor effect on squamous cell carci-
noma, mainly by inhibiting RNA function. In the
present study, we found high OPRT expression in
MPM tumor tissues. Therefore, we presumed that
MPM would have the potential to respond more to S-
1 treatment.
In contrast, although pemetrexed inhibits multiple
enzymes involved in pyrimidine and purine synthe-
sis,25 its major target enzyme is TS (Fig. 3). After cellu-
lar
uptake, pemetrexed
is converted
into more
effective polyglutamated forms by folylpoly-g-gluta-
mate synthetase (FPGS). There is no pathway related
to OPRT in its mode of action. Overall, like in squa-
mous lung cancer and thymic carcinoma,10 when
combined with TS inhibition, cancer tissue that have
high OPRT protein expression have the potential to
RARE DISEASES
e1165909-5
 be treated with S-1 through the inhibition for RNA
synthease.
There are a few limitation of this study that were
the small sample size, single institution and retrospec-
tive case control study. Twelve of 15 patients were
treated
with
pemetrexed-based
chemotherapy.
Though we could find statistical significant between
TS expression and overall survival, in 2013 Lustgarten
et al. for 85 MPM patients26 and Mairinger et al. for
63 MPM patients27 reported that TS expression might
not be a marker of pemetrexed efficacy. Given this, TS
expression might not be important in we will follow-
up on patients in the current study.
Another limitation is that we observed only one
effective case of S-1 treatment. For this patient, we
administrated a combination of CBDCA plus S-1, so
the efficacy of S-1 was not determined in isolation.
Theoretically, however, the high OPRT expression
should have affected S-1 treatment.
Finally, there are side effects of S-1 therapy. In this
present case, the patient was treated with S-1 after 17
courses of pemetrexed and gemcitabine. There were
thus hematological side effects (grade 4 anemia requir-
ing blood transfusion). Rare treatments of this kind
are difficult to generalize, so we will require more pro-
spective studies.
In conclusion, in MPM patients, we found high
OPRT expression (12/14 cases) compared to other 5-
FU metabolic-related proteins. And we experienced
that for TS inhibition, pemetrexed as well as S-1
respond to refractory MPM patient. Theoretically,
high OPRT expression could be expected to be more
effective for S-1 treatment. Further clinical studies of
S-1 with MPM are needed.
