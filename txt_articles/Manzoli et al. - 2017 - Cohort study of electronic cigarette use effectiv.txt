ABSTRACT
Objective To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
e-cigarettes, by comparing users of only e-cigarettes,
smokers of only tobacco cigarettes and dual users.
Design Prospective cohort study. We update previous
12-month findings and report the results of the
24-month follow-up.
Data sources Direct contact and questionnaires by
phone or via internet.
Methods Adults (30–75 years) were classified as: (1)
tobacco smokers, if they smoked ≥1 tobacco cigarette/day,
(2) e-cigarette users, if they inhaled ≥50 puffs/week of
any type of e-cigarette and (3) dual users, if they
smoked tobacco cigarettes and also used e-cigarettes.
Carbon monoxide levels were tested in 50% of those
declaring tobacco smoking abstinence. Hospital
discharge data were used to validate possibly related
serious adverse events in 46.0% of the sample.
Main outcome measures Sustained abstinence from
tobacco cigarettes and/or e-cigarettes after 24 months,
the difference in the number of tobacco cigarettes
smoked daily between baseline and 24 months, possibly
related serious adverse events.
Results Data at 24 months were available for 229
e-cigarette users, 480 tobacco smokers and 223 dual
users (overall response rate 68.8%). Of the e-cigarette
users, 61.1% remained abstinent from tobacco (while
23.1% and 26.0% of tobacco-only smokers and dual
users achieved tobacco abstinence). The rate (18.8%) of
stopping use of either product (tobacco and/or
e-cigarettes) was not higher for e-cigarette users
compared with tobacco smokers or dual users. Self-rated
health and adverse events were similar between all
groups. Among those continuing to smoke, there were
no differences in the proportion of participants reducing
tobacco cigarette consumption by 50% or more, the
average daily number of cigarettes and the average self-
rated health by baseline group. Most dual users at
baseline abandoned e-cigarettes and continued to
smoke tobacco. Those who continued dual using or
converted from tobacco smoking to dual use during
follow-up experienced significant improvements in the
3 outcomes compared with those who continued or
switched to only smoking tobacco (p<0.001).
Conclusions E-cigarette use alone might support
tobacco quitters remaining abstinent from smoking.
However, dual use did not improve the likelihood of
quitting tobacco or e-cigarette use, but may be
helpful to reduce tobacco consumption. Adverse
event data were scarce and must be considered
preliminary.
Trial registration number NCT01785537.
INTRODUCTION
Despite their potential public health relevance,
the current evidence on the safety and efficacy/
effectiveness of e-cigarettes is scarce, and long-term
data are urgently needed.1–7 The published pro-
spective evidence on the efficacy/effectiveness for
healthy
participants
consists
of
2
randomised
trials,8 9 2 single-arm small trials10–12 and 11 obser-
vational studies.13–23 However, these studies mostly
included users of both tobacco and e-cigarettes fol-
lowed for ≤12 months, used various assessment
methods, and did not directly compare e-cigarette
users and tobacco smokers.4 6 7 24 25 Moreover, the
entire evidence on e-cigarette safety—at 6 months
—is limited to 122 healthy participants, most of
whom were also smoking tobacco for most of the
follow-up.8

METHODS
The protocol and 12-month results of this prospect-
ive cohort study are reported elsewhere,26 27 and
registered in Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01785537). In
brief, we recruited adults (30–75 years) who were:
(1) tobacco smokers of ≥1 tobacco cigarette daily
for ≥6 months; (2) e-cigarette users of any type of
e-cigarette for ≥6 months (3) dual users of tobacco
and e-cigarettes for ≥6 months, via general practi-
tioners, e-cigarette shops, internet advertisements
and social networks.
Data were collected through a structured ques-
tionnaire, administered through phone interview
and/or by internet, and follow-up will continue up
to 60 months. T
wo investigators (MEF and LM)
tested carbon monoxide levels in expired breath
(Smokerlyzer

in
a
random sample of those declaring tobacco smoking
abstinence (25% and 50% at 12 and 24 months,
respectively).
The work was approved by Chieti University
Ethics Committee; all participants provided written
informed consent.
Outcome variables and data analysis
The primary outcome was the percentage of sus-
tained (30 days) abstinence from tobacco smoking
at 24 months. Other outcomes were the proportion
of

 cigarettes smoked per day (and the proportion of participants
reducing tobacco cigarette consumption by 50% or more
between baseline and 24 months), self-reported health (assessed
through the final item of the Italian version of the EuroQol
EQ-D5L28) and possibly related serious adverse events. Adverse
events were both self-reported and gathered from data obtained
from the regional hospital discharge administrative database
(Italian Scheda di Dimissione Ospedaliera) for the residents in the
Abruzzo Region (46.0% of the sample); and only self-reported
for the rest of the sample. The details of the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM) codes used to extract adverse events are reported in
the protocol27 and in the online supplementary material.
The differences by baseline cigarette use were evaluated using
Kruskal-W
allis or one-way analysis of variance with Sidak cor-
rection for continuous variables, and χ2 test for categorical vari-
ables. For the latter, when more than two categories were
compared (such as for cigarette use), separate comparisons were
made for one group versus the others, and different p values
were computed. The difference in continuous variables (ie,
number of cigarettes smoked per day) within groups between
baseline and end of follow-up was evaluated through Wilcoxon
matched-pairs signed-rank test.
Multivariable random-effect linear and logistic regressions,
with geographical region as the cluster unit, were used to in-
vestigate potential predictors of continuous and categorical
outcomes, respectively. W
e set eight multivariable models for
the following outcomes: (A) tobacco smoking abstinence at
24 months; (B) abstinence from both tobacco smoking and
e-cigarette use at 24 months; (C) possibly related serious
adverse events at 24 months; (D) reduction by ≥50% of tobacco
cigarette consumption from baseline to 24 months, by baseline
cigarette use group (this model was fitted into two versions: the
first included the whole sample of tobacco and dual users at
baseline; the second included only the subsample of continuing
smokers, excluding those who had quit and whose cigarette con-
sumption was zero at follow-up); (E) reduction by ≥50% of
tobacco cigarette consumption from baseline to 24 months, by
24-month cigarette use group (as most dual users switched
to another group, this model and model G were needed to
further investigate the potential predictors of tobacco smoking
reduction among the switchers); (F) difference in the daily
number of tobacco cigarettes smoked per day at 24 months
compared with baseline, by baseline cigarette use group (this
model was fitted into two versions: the first included the
whole sample of tobacco and dual users at baseline; the second
included only the subsample of continuing smokers, excluding
those who had quit and whose cigarette consumption was zero
at follow-up); (G) difference in the daily number of tobacco
cigarettes smoked per day at 24 months compared with base-
line, by 24-month cigarette use group and (H) difference in
the self-rated health at 24 months compared with baseline.
The users of e-cigarettes only at baseline were excluded from
models D, E, F and G.
With the exceptions of models C, E and G, which included a
limited number of successes and had to be fitted with a
restricted set of covariates, for all other models the number of
successes of categorical outcomes (excluding adverse events)
approximated 10 successes for each recorded variable (thus
avoiding overfitting requirements).29 It was thus decided a priori
to include all recorded variables into all final models regardless
of significance, unless inclusion would create multicollinearity
or violate other assumptions. Each covariate was tested in its
original form or transformed if needed: only the number of
cigarettes smoked per day was transformed into its square root;
because the results were similar to those with the covariate
included in its untransformed version, it was thus kept in the
model in its original form. Models A, B, D, F and H were
adjusted for the following baseline characteristics: age, gender,
body mass index, marital status, educational level, occupation,
alcohol use, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, self-
rated health and years of tobacco smoking (former smoking for
e-cigarette-only users). W
e excluded physical activity from the
final multivariate models due to substantial missing data (n=41)
and its virtually null effect on any dependent variables. The
number of tobacco cigarettes smoked per day was transformed
to be included into models A, B, C and H: because no tobacco
cigarettes were smoked at baseline by e-cigarette-only users, we
recategorised the amount of smoking, using tertiles. Those
smoking <10 tobacco cigarettes per day (or <50 puffs per day
if e-cigarette-only smokers) at baseline were assigned to the
lowest tertile of consumption; smokers of 10–19 tobacco cigar-
ettes (or 50–100 puffs if e-cigarette-only users) per day at base-
line were assigned to the intermediate tertile; smokers of 20 or
more cigarettes (or 100 or more puffs if e-cigarette-only users)
per day at baseline were classified into the highest tertile.
Potential interactions with the dependent variable and/or
quadratic/cubic terms were investigated for all covariates. In
logistic regression analyses, the outlier analysis was based on
Pearson calculation and standardised residuals, the change in
Pearson χ2, and Dbeta influence statistics and leverage (hat diag-
onal matrix). The validity of the final linear regression models
was assessed as follows. The assumption of constant error vari-
ance was checked graphically, plotting Pearson residuals versus
fitted values, and formally, using the Cook-W
eisberg test for
heteroscedasticity. High leverage observations were identified by
computing Pearson, standardised and studentised residuals,
Cook’s D influence, W
elsch distance and the hat diagonal
matrix (LC Hamilton. Statistics with Stata: Version 12, Eighth
Edition. Boston: Cengage 2013). W
e found <30 influential or
high-leverage observations in all models. In all cases, we
repeated the analyses excluding these observations, with no sub-
stantial changes, and we thus kept all observations in the
models.
W
e had very few missing data for all outcome variables (<5)
except self-rated health, which was not answered by 56 partici-
pants at baseline (but only 30 of them were kept in the
24-month assessment), and by 3 participants at the 24-month
follow-up. Models A, B, C and H were rerun without self-rated
health at baseline (−30 participants), with no appreciable vari-
ation, therefore it was retained. Model H was inevitably fitted
with 33 missing observations. Given that the participants lost in
model H were relatively few (3.5% of the sample) and balanced
across baseline groups, no missing data imputation technique
was adopted. Finally, the distribution of the difference in self-
rated health was relatively skewed (Shapiro-Wilk p<0.01) and
model G was set also using its cubic form. However, again the
estimates of p values of cigarette use covariates were similar and
the dependent variable was maintained in its original form to
facilitate results interpretation.
The results of the logistic regression analyses are presented as
ORs and the corresponding 95% CIs whereas the results of the
linear regression analyses are presented as β-coefficients and
95% CIs. A two-tailed p value of 0.05 was considered signifi-
cant for all analyses, which were performed using Stata V
.13.1
(Stata Corp, College Station, T
exas, USA, 2014).

 RESULTS
The flow of the participants is shown in figure 1 and baseline
characteristics are reported in online supplementary table S1.
After 24 months, 61.1% of the 229 baseline e-cigarette-only
users were still abstinent from tobacco smoking; 23.1% of
the 480 baseline tobacco smokers and 26.0% of the 223 base-
line dual users achieved tobacco abstinence (p<0.001 for
e-cigarette-only users vs tobacco smokers or dual users; table 1).
The proportion of participants who achieved complete abstin-
ence (who were using neither tobacco cigarettes nor e-cigarettes)
did not significantly differ by baseline use group: 18.8%, 17.5%
and 14.3% among e-cigarette users, tobacco smokers and dual
users, respectively (all p>0.05).
The proportion of participants reducing tobacco cigarette
consumption by 50% or more, or by ≥5 tobacco cigarettes per
day, and the average daily number of cigarettes, did not change
by baseline group (table 1; all p>0.05). Importantly, the major-
ity (83.4%) of dual users at baseline abandoned e-cigarettes and
continued to smoke only tobacco (57.4%), or quit tobacco
(11.7%) or both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes (14.3%)
during follow-up (table 1). Therefore, a second analysis was
conducted stratifying by baseline and 24-month cigarette use, in
order to assess the variation of the pattern of consumption
among the switchers as well. Among the 603 tobacco-only
smokers or dual users at baseline, 21 of the 40 (52.5%) partici-
pants who started or continued dual use during the follow-up
reduced tobacco cigarette consumption by ≥50%, while only 67
of the 489 (13.7%) participants who started or continued only
tobacco smoking showed a ≥50% cigarette reduction (p<0.001,
table 1).
No significant differences in average self-rated health were
noted by baseline group (all p>0.05). A substantial improve-
ment, however, was observed for tobacco smokers or dual users
who switched to e-cigarettes only (+1.1 or 1.0 in EuroQol
mean score, respectively; p<0.05; table 1).
W
e recorded an identical number of mouth irritations (n=38)
and possibly related serious adverse events (n=38; table 1).
Potential adverse events were reported by 4.4%, 2.9% and
6.3% of baseline e-cigarette users, tobacco smokers and dual
users, respectively (p<0.05 for the comparison of tobacco
smokers vs dual users). Mouth irritation rates were 6.1%, 4.2%
and 1.8% in the above groups (p<0.05 for the comparison of
e-cigarette users vs dual users). The distribution of adverse
events by baseline and 24-month group is reported in figure 1.
The characteristics of the participants reporting a serious
adverse event, and its type, are reported in online supplemen-
tary table S2. Also, the cigarette use throughout the follow-up
of the 38 participants experiencing a possibly related serious
adverse event is shown in online supplementary figure S1.
Notably, most tobacco-only smokers at baseline, who experi-
enced an adverse event, remained tobacco-only smokers or quit
both tobacco smoking and e-cigarette use. In contrast, most of
the e-cigarette-only and dual users at baseline who experienced
a serious adverse event (n=24), switched group during the
24-month follow-up: 13 switched to tobacco smoking only, and
5 quit both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes.
Multivariate
analyses
substantially
confirmed
univariate
results (table 2): when several potential confounders were
adjusted for, tobacco smoking abstinence remained significantly
more likely among e-cigarette users (adjusted OR 5.56; 95% CI
3.89 to 7.95; p<0.001); the likelihood of abstinence from
tobacco smoking and e-cigarette use, as well as self-reported
health, did not significantly vary by baseline group (p>0.05);
the probability of halving or reducing the average number of
daily tobacco cigarettes smoked did not change by baseline
group, but tobacco smokers who started dual use or dual users

 who continued dual using, were significantly more likely to
halve their tobacco cigarette consumption and to decrease the
average number of cigarettes per day than those who started or
continued only smoking tobacco (all p<0.001); dual users at
baseline remained significantly more likely to report a serious
adverse event than tobacco-only smokers (OR 2.40; 95% CI
1.09 to 5.26; p=0.029).
Switching or quitting cigarette use
Overall, 435 participants switched (n=276; 29.6%) or stopped
(n=159; 17.1%) using either product (tobacco cigarettes or
e-cigarettes) during the follow-up (figure 1 and table 3). Very
few tobacco cigarette smokers switched to dual use (5.6%) or
to e-cigarettes only (1.3%). In contrast, only 16.6% of dual
users remained dual users after 24 months, and most of them
(57.4%) abandoned e-cigarettes and continued to smoke only
tobacco cigarettes. Thirty-nine per cent of e-cigarette-only users
switched to tobacco smoking, while 42.4% continued with e-
cigarettes only or stopped using either tobacco cigarettes or
e-cigarettes.
Of the 159 participants who quit using either product at
24 months, 91 had quit at the 12-month follow-up (57.2%). Of
the 131 participants who quit using either product at 12 months,
6 were lost to follow-up, 91 remained abstinent and 34 relapsed
(27.2%): 29 to tobacco smoking only
, 4 to e-cigarettes only and
1 to dual use. Similar results were observed for quitting tobacco
cigarettes (table 3).
Other secondary findings on CO levels, the other predictors
of tobacco smoking, and abstinence from tobacco cigarettes and
e-cigarettes, and adverse events, are reported in the online sup-
plementary material.
DISCUSSION
To date, this is the only study to directly compare smokers of
tobacco cigarettes only with users of e-cigarettes only, and to
provide safety data on e-cigarette-only users for >12 months.
With respect to the first year of follow-up, the analyses after the
second year provided some important confirmations and some
new insights.
This confirms that complete switching to e-cigarettes may
help tobacco quitters remain abstinent from smoking: after
24 months the rate of relapse to tobacco smoking remained
relatively low (38.9%), if compared with the 60–90% relapse
rates of tobacco cigarette smokers observed in population-based
studies.30 It should be kept in mind that all e-cigarette users in
our sample were former tobacco smokers at baseline, with a
mean time of 8 months since switching to e-cigarettes. Notably,
the analysis of those who had quit tobacco smoking at
12 months showed that the relapse rates to tobacco smoking at
24 months were also relatively low for tobacco-only smokers
(30.3%; table 3). With regard to safety, the rate of adverse
events was not lower in e-cigarette-only users than in tobacco
smokers, which was expected in this phase of the study, given
that the excess risk of tobacco smoking takes 1–5 years to sub-
stantially decrease.31 32
The results also confirmed that the use of e-cigarettes in add-
ition to tobacco smoking (dual use) does not seem to encourage
tobacco smokers to quit tobacco. Further, dual users at baseline
did not differ from tobacco-only smokers in tobacco cigarette
consumption and self-rated health. However, the vast majority
of dual users switched to another use status during the
follow-up, which suggests that dual use is generally a transient
phase rather than a long-term pattern of use. Further, the
analyses

baseline
status

However,
when
baseline
and
24-month use data were considered together, we found that
tobacco-only smokers who started dual use or dual users who
continued dual use were significantly more likely to reduce the
average number of daily cigarettes, to reduce their consumption
by 50% or more, and showed a significant increase in self-rated
health at 24 months compared with those who returned to or
continued smoking only tobacco. Similarly, while baseline dual
users showed a significantly higher probability of a serious
adverse event, all these events occurred in participants who
switched group during the 24-month follow-up: six stopped
smoking (two of whom continued using e-cigarettes) and eight
returned to only smoking cigarettes. Moreover, it cannot be
excluded that, particularly for those who returned to only
smoking tobacco, the previous years of exposure to smoking
(23 years on average in our sample) played a greater role in
developing an adverse health outcome beyond the 1-year (n=4)
or 2-year (n=4) periods of dual use.
Our findings on smoking cessation and reduction rates are
comparable to some previous studies,10 14 16 18 20 33 but differ-
ent from others.11 13 15 17 18 33 As a potential explanation,
three of the latter studies may have had less motivated
samples,9 11 17 and another included some countries with an
e-cigarette ban, which could affect use patterns.13 Our relapse
rate to tobacco smoking among e-cigarette users doubled the
estimate by Etter and Bullen16 (whose sample, however, may
have
been
highly
motivated
to
maintain
abstinence
from
smoking as they were recruited from smoking cessation web-
sites), but was much lower than the ≅94% relapse rate in the
randomised controlled trial by Bullen et al.8 However, our
observational study included e-cigarette users who were already
abstinent from tobacco smoking for many months prior to
recruitment, did not control for type of e-cigarette used and
had broader inclusion criteria than some other studies (eg,
included smokers of <10 cigarettes per day).
Some of our study limitations have already been reported in
detail elsewhere.26 In brief, smoking cessation was partially self-
reported. However, we tested CO levels in 50% of the sample
in the 24-month follow-up, finding false declarations were spor-
adic
(n=1
among
e-cigarette
users;
n=2
among
tobacco
smokers). Second, we had no 24-month follow-up data for
31.2% of baseline participants. However, the loss rate is still
lower than those in most previous prospective studies,9 11 14 16–18
and non-responders were similar to responders for most baseline
variables.26 Third, we did not distinguish between different types
of e-cigarettes used, and could not reliably assess frequency of
use. These factors (product type and frequency of use) appear to
be important characteristics predicting change in smoking behav-
iour.14 19 20 Finally, it has been suggested that dual users are fre-
quently ‘quitting failures’ and thus biased against cessation.6
However, in our sample, the proportion of those who tried quit-
ting before was quite similar between tobacco smokers (33.7%)
and dual users (35.9%).
CONCLUSIONS
Overall, the first 2 years of the study confirm that switching
completely to e-cigarettes might help tobacco smokers remain
abstinent from smoking. The findings on dual use of e-cigarettes
and tobacco smoking remain controversial: dual use did not
improve the likelihood of quitting tobacco or use of e-cigarettes,
but it may facilitate the reduction of tobacco cigarette consump-
tion and improve self-rated health. Dual use also did not appear
to reduce smoking quit rates compared with those of smokers
not using e-cigarettes. Adverse events were still scarce, and the

What this paper adds
▸ Despite the potential public health relevance, the current
evidence on long-term safety and efficacy/effectiveness of
e-cigarettes is scarce and conflicting.
▸ After 24 months of a prospective follow-up, most users of
e-cigarettes alone were able to remain abstinent from
tobacco smoking.
▸ Dual use of e-cigarettes with tobacco cigarettes did not
encourage quitting tobacco or e-cigarette use, but may be
helpful to reduce tobacco consumption.
