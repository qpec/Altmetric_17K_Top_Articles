Abstract 
24 
Study Design: Prospective, randomized, partially-blinded.  
25 
Background: GTPS is the current terminology for what was once called greater trochanteric or 
26 
sub-gluteal bursitis. Cortisone (corticosteroid) injections into the lateral hip is a traditionally 
27 
accepted treatment for this condition. However, the effectiveness of injecting the bursa with 
28 
steroids is increasingly being questioned, and an equally effective treatment with fewer adverse 
29 
side-effects would be beneficial.  
30 
Objective: To investigate whether administration of dry needling (DN) is non-inferior to 
31 
cortisone injections in reducing lateral hip pain and improving function in patients with greater 
32 
trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS).  
33 
Methods: Forty-three participants (50 hips observed), all with GTPS, were randomly assigned to 
34 
a group receiving cortisone injections or DN. Treatments were administered over 6 weeks, and 
35 
clinical outcomes were collected at 0, 1,3, and 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the 
36 
numeric pain rating scale (0-10). The secondary outcome measure was the Patient Specific 
37 
Function Scale (0-10). Medication intake for pain was collected as a tertiary outcome.  
38 
Results: Baseline characteristics were similar in the groups. A non-inferiority test for repeated 
39 
measures design on pain and averaged function scores at 6 weeks (with a non-inferiority margin 
40 
of 1.5 for both outcomes), indicates non-inferiority of DN vs. cortisone injections (p-values of 
41 
<0.01 for both).  Medication usage (p-value=0.74) was not different between groups at the same 
42 
time point.  
43 
Conclusions: Cortisone injections for GTPS did not provide greater pain relief or reduction in 
44 
functional limitations than DN. Our data suggest that DN is a non-inferior treatment alternative 
45 
to cortisone injections in this patient population.

Introduction 
51 
Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is the current terminology for what used to 
52 
be called greater trochanteric or sub-gluteal bursitis. Characterized by chronic, intermittent pain 
53 
accompanied by tenderness to palpation overlying the lateral aspect of the hip,31,39,45 GTPS is 
54 
estimated to affect 10-25% of the general population.39,45 The incidence has been reported to be 
55 
higher in women and patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, iliotibial band 
56 
tenderness, and obesity.31,45 The change in nomenclature was due to studies which demonstrated 
57 
that in most cases contractile tissues, not the bursa, are injured, and that inflammation is often 
58 
not involved.2,3,31,35,45 GTPS includes a number of disorders involving the lateral hip, including 
59 
bursitis, gluteal tears, external coxa saltans (snapping hip), and trigger points in contractile tissue 
60 
crossing the hip.27 Cortisone injection (CI) into the lateral hip, with intention of injecting the 
61 
bursa, has been a traditionally accepted treatment for this condition. Since the medical 
62 
community agrees that the etiology of GTPS is not necessarily the bursa around the greater 
63 
trochanter,1,3,33,34 attempting to inject the bursa with a steroid is not as logical as once thought. 
64 
Furthermore, corticosteroid injections pose potential concern for providers and patients. The 
65 
adverse effects of steroid injections are poorly quantified,4 but clinically significant adverse side 
66 
effects, such as osteonecrosis,30 osteomyelitis,36 hallucinations,29 and death,4 have been 
67 
documented. Dry needling (DN), whereby filament needles are used to stimulate sensitive loci

(trigger points) in the muscles, has shown potential in treating soft-tissue injury and 
69 
neuromyofascial pain with minimal risks.6,9,14,21-23,26,28,43 
70 
Evidence suggests that analgesic injection is not superior to DN in other regions of the 
71 
body.15,19,44 Therefore, it is possible that CI for GTPS is not superior to DN. If DN is equally or 
72 
more effective in treating GTPS as CI, then effective patient care could be delivered without 
73 
subjecting patients to the harmful effects of steroids. This would not only avoid any detrimental 
74 
effects of steroids in these patients, but would enable individuals with contraindications to 
75 
steroid injection to receive an equally effective form of treatment and provide an alternative 
76 
treatment to those who did not respond positively to CI. 
77 
The purpose of this study was to explore if administration of DN is equally effective as 
78 
CI in reducing lateral hip pain and improving function in patients with GTPS. We hypothesize 
79 
that there is no difference between DN and CI in reducing lateral hip pain and improving 
80 
function in this patient population.

86 
Participants 
87 
Participants (N=43; 21 in DN and 22 in CI, with 50 hips observed) were all patients 
88 
treated by providers within the orthopaedic department of the Baylor Scott and White (BSW) 
89 
Bone and Joint Institute between May of 2013 and July of 2015. The study was approved by the

Institutional Review Board of BSW. All subjects provided consent prior to study enrollment. The 
91 
rights of the participants were protected. 
92 
Inclusion criteria were 18+ years of age, lateral hip pain (pain anywhere from the iliac 
93 
crest to the mid ITB), and an active email account. Exclusion criteria were: low back pain 
94 
associated with the hip pain, motor and/or sensory impairment consistent with radiculopathy, 
95 
active infection or malignancy of the hip, connective tissue disease, non-English speaking, and 
96 
pregnancy. 
97 
 
98 
Randomization/ blinding: 
99 
The patients were randomized to either the DN or CI treatments in a block (size 10) 
100 
randomized scheme. The block randomization was used to reduce the variability between 
101 
treatment groups and reduce bias.10 The randomization schedule was provided by the 
102 
biostatistician, performed using SAS software v. 9.2. Once the patient consented to participate in 
103 
the study, they were allocated to either DN or CI according to the randomization schedule to an 
104 
independent study research coordinator, to provide allocation concealment. The independent 
105 
study research coordinator was not blinded to group allocation. 
106 
Patients were not told which treatment they would receive, and were instructed to 
107 
schedule with a specific provider.  Despite not telling patients which group they were in, patients 
108 
could identify their group allocation, thus they were not blinded. 
109 
Participant flow 
110 
 
The study protocol was approved for recruitment of 50 subjects (25 per group). At one 
111 
point during data collection, two subjects withdrew from the DN group, so we requested and 
112 
received approval to/from the IRB to allow site enrollment of an additional 2 subjects.

Assignment of subjects into groups continued according to the original allocation list, and once 
114 
the CI group was assigned its final subject, the subsequent subjects were allocated to the DN 
115 
group, since that was the group from which both previous subjects withdrew. 
116 
 
117 
Outcome measures 
118 
The numerical pain rating scale (0-10) and Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) (0-
119 
10) at 6 weeks following initial treatment were the primary and secondary outcome measures, 
120 
respectively. The PSFS metric allows patients to identify up to five tasks which are most limited 
121 
by a specific body part, in the case of this study, the hip. The patient assigned a score (0-10) to 
122 
each task he/she designated (0-unable to perform activity; 10- able to perform activity at the 
123 
same level as before injury or problem). The final score was a weighted score, where the weights 
124 
were calculated as the number of times the repeated function appeared, divided by the total 
125 
number of functions the patient listed. 
126 
Medication intake for pain in the involved hip, gender, age, and body mass index (BMI), 
127 
were collected as covariables. 
128 
 
129 
Time frame for measurements 
130 
Measurements were taken at baseline (within 24 hours prior to initial treatment) and 1, 3, 
131 
and 6 weeks after initial treatment. Data were collected at the initial and follow-up appointments 
132 
or by email. The outcome scales were explained and collected by a third party research 
133 
coordinator. Instructions for answering the scales were read to the patient at every data collection 
134 
period.

Treatment Groups 
137 
DN: Treatment was initiated during the first visit. Exact location of needle insertion and number 
138 
of penetrations within the region of the involved posterolateral hip were determined by the 
139 
treating therapist. DN procedure is outlined in Table 2. All patients in this group were treated by 
140 
the same investigator who is certified in DN, has 17 years of clinical practice experience, and 4 
141 
years of experience in DN. The number of follow-up visits within 6 weeks following initiation of 
142 
study treatment was determined by the therapist. DN was the only form of treatment 
143 
administered. 
144 
CI: Treatment was carried out during the first visit. Exact location and technique of injection 
145 
within the region of the involved greater trochanter was determined by the provider. Injection 
146 
prescription and technique is outlined in Table 3. Injections were done by one of three 
147 
orthopaedic surgeons, or one of two physician assistants. The number of follow-up visits within 
148 
6 weeks following initiation of study treatment was determined by the provider. CI was the only 
149 
form of treatment administered. 
150 
 
151 
Sample size determination:  
152 
The goal of this study was to investigate the use of DN as a non-inferior alternative to CI 
153 
with pain as the primary outcome. A two-sample t-test for non-inferiority was used, with a non-
154 
inferiority margin of 1.5, a standard deviation of 2, and a true difference of 0.12,42 It was assumed 
155 
that a difference in 3 units was of clinical significance.7,8,18,20,24,25 The sample size was calculated 
156 
for a significance level of 0.05 and 80% power. The resulting sample size was 23 observations 
157 
(hips) per arm. Assuming a dropout of 5%, the target sample size was 25 observations (hips) per 
158 
arm. These calculations were done with PASS 13.

Data Analysis 
161 
Descriptive statistics are reported for baseline characteristics and demographics (Table 
162 
1). Mixed effects models were used to evaluate the effect of treatment on pain and the PSFS 
163 
scores over time.  A non-inferiority test with a margin of 1.5, as illustrated by Mascha and 
164 
Sessler,25 was used to assess the non-inferiority of DN over CI for pain and PSFS at 6 weeks 
165 
within the mixed effects model. In a non-inferiority test, the null hypothesis is that the treatments 
166 
are different by at least the given margin of clinical importance, and the alternative hypothesis is 
167 
that the differences between treatments are not within the non-inferiority margin, and hence DN 
168 
is not inferior to CI. Statistical significance was declared at the 0.05 level. Analyses were 
169 
performed with SAS 9.4 for windows, StatXact v. 11.0, and the graphs were created using R 
170 
software version 3.1.0. 
171 
 
172 
Results 
173 
 
174 
Baseline characteristics and demographics were similar between groups (Table 1). Age, 
175 
despite having a difference of 8.8 years (61.3±16.5 for the DN group and 70.1±11.4 for the CI 
176 
group), was not considered to be different since these patients still fell within the elderly age 
177 
category (61-70).  Hips treated in the DN group received 3-7 treatments (mean=5.4) based on 
178 
provider recommendations per standard of care, and hips treated in the CI groups received one 
179 
treatment (mean=1.0) per standard of care. Our data showed no difference in pain scores, 
180 
function scores, or medication intake between groups at baseline.

Pain: 
183 
Numerical pain rating scores between the two groups did not differ at 6 weeks.  A mixed 
184 
effects model using time and treatment as covariates indicated that time and the interaction 
185 
between treatment and time were statistically significant, but not the treatment (p-values of 
186 
<0.01, <0.001 and 0.81, respectively). Age and gender were included as covariate but were not 
187 
significant (p-values of 0.15 and 0.21, respectively), and were not included in the final model. 
188 
The confidence intervals (Table 4) and Figure 1, indicate that that interaction appears between 
189 
weeks 1 and 3, but the effects become similar, and DN is not shown to be inferior to CI at 6 
190 
weeks with a difference of -1.12 (95% CI: -2.99, 0.74) (Table 5). The non-inferiority test with a 
191 
1.5 margin suggested non-inferiority between the treatment groups (p < 0.01), rejecting the null 
192 
hypothesis of CI being superior to DN. The maximum difference in pain scores of 1.3 ± 2.6 was 
193 
observed between the groups at 3 weeks (Figure 1). 
194 
 
195 
Function: 
196 
Averaged and weighted PSFS between the two groups did not differ at 6 weeks. The 
197 
mixed effects model using time and treatment as covariates indicated that time was statistically 
198 
significant but not treatment (p-values of <0.01 and 0.63 respectively). Gender and age were 
199 
considered in the model, but were not significant (p-values of 0.17 and 0.17, respectively), so 
200 
they were not included in the final model.  The non-inferiority test with a 1.5 non-inferior margin 
201 
from the mixed model found DN to not be inferior to CI with a difference of 0.2 (95% CI: -0.57, 
202 
0.96), p < 0.01. The maximum difference in function scores of -1.3 ± 2.5 was observed between 
203 
the groups at 1 week (Figure 2).

Medication Intake: 
206 
Medication intake for pain associated with the involved hip did not differ between the 
207 
two groups at 6 weeks (p-value=0.74), or any other time period (p-values= 0.19, and 0.11 at 1 
208 
week, and 3 weeks, respectively). 
209 
  
210 
Details of Functional Deficits: 
211 
While analysis of the nature of functional limitations was not an aim of this study, we did 
212 
characterize the functional limitations as listed by the subjects (Figure 3). Due to the variability 
213 
in possible answers inherent to this metric, we stratified functions into seven categories: 
214 
locomotion, closed chain, lying on the involved side, lying on the uninvolved side, sitting, and 
215 
other.  
216 
Adverse Effects: 
217 
 
No adverse effects were observed by the clinicians or reported by any of the subjects for 
218 
either group. The typical side effects associated with needle penetration/injection, such as 
219 
temporary pain, bruising, and post-treatment soreness were not documented as adverse effects. 
220 
 
221 
Discussion 
222 
 
223 
GTPS is a fairly common condition which encompasses a number of potential etiologies. 
224 
Historically, the clinical presentation of GTPS was attributed to bursitis and often treated with 
225 
CI. More recent evidence has indicated pathology/dysfunction of other structures of the 
226 
posterolateral hip/pelvis, and led to other forms of intervention. In this study, we sought to 
227 
explore if DN, which does not involve pharmaceutical administration, resulted in non-inferior

clinical outcomes to CI in patients with GTPS. Our results indicate no inferiority in the clinical 
229 
outcomes of pain or function between CI and DN in this patient population. This study is the first 
230 
to directly compare these two treatments for GTPS.  
231 
The mechanism by which DN is effective in pain reduction and improved function is not 
232 
fully understood, but researchers have discovered biochemical, neurologic, vascular, and clinical 
233 
changes effected through this technique.6 Shah et al32 found significantly elevated levels of 
234 
inflammatory and pain biochemicals (p<0.01) and lower pH (p<0.02) in the blood surrounding 
235 
active trigger points in the upper trapezius muscle when compared with subjects with latent or no 
236 
trigger points in the upper trapezius. Following DN, subjects with active trigger points had 
237 
significantly lower levels of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (p<0.02)—both are 
238 
chemicals associated with pain. Simons et al35 recorded endplate noise at myofascial trigger 
239 
points (MTrPs) which was significantly elevated compared with sites outside of the MTrP but 
240 
within the endplate. One MTrP (experimental) site and 2 non-MTrP (control) sites were 
241 
identified in 11 muscles in 10 subjects. One of the control sites was within the endplate, but 
242 
outside of the trigger point. The other control site was a taught band, outside of the endplate. 
243 
Endplate noise without spikes was recorded in all 11 MTrPs, 4 of the control sites within the 
244 
endplate (p= 0.024), and none of the control sites outside of the endplate (p=0.000034). These 
245 
data indicate consistently increased motor excitability of MTrPs. Ge et al16 measured lower H-
246 
reflex thresholds (p<0.001) and higher amplitudes (p<0.001) in MTrPs than in non-MTrP in 13 
247 
of 13 subjects, indicating elevated gain in the anterior motor horn and increased spindle 
248 
excitability of the segments coinciding with the MTrPs. These findings offer more evidence of 
249 
discreet elevated motor activity within the muscle, but also a spinal segmental etiology. In 
250 
keeping with this finding of segmental excitability associated with MTrPs, Srbely38 demonstrated

an immediate increase in pressure pain threshold in the infraspinatus (p<0.015), but not gluteus 
252 
medius muscles, of subjects following 1 session of TDN to an active MTrP in the supraspinatus. 
253 
Furthermore, Skorupska et al37 reported vasodilation in the region of referred pain in 16 subjects 
254 
who underwent DN for sub-acute sciatic pain, suggesting sympathetic nervous activity in the 
255 
myofascial pain mechanism. Data such as these have bolstered the theory originally put forth by 
256 
Simons et al35 and expounded upon by Gerwin et al17 that MTrPs are discreet painful loci in the 
257 
muscles due to altered motor endplate activity, leading to tonic fiber contraction, local ischemia, 
258 
myofiber injury, and biochemical imbalance. 
259 
Other studies have reported good improvement in pain and function when the active 
260 
MTrP was treated13,40 and when remote latent MTrPs, not necessarily in the same neurologic 
261 
segment, were treated.41 In a randomized controlled trial, Fernandez-Carnero et al13 reported 
262 
increased pain free jaw opening range of motion (p<0.001) and decreased pressure pain threshold 
263 
in the masseter (p<0.001) and mandibular condyle (p<0.001) after 2 sessions of DN, 7 days 
264 
apart. In a randomized controlled trial of 41 patients with a whiplash diagnosis, 20 were treated 
265 
with DN to active MTrPs and 21 underwent sham treatment with blunted needles to these same 
266 
points.40 At the end of the 6 week trial, significantly more patients who were treated with DN 
267 
had stopped taking analgesics (p=0.04). In a study by Tsai et al,41 35 patients with unilateral 
268 
active MTrPs in the trapezius were randomly divided into a DN group (n=17) who received DN 
269 
into a latent MTrP in the ipsilateral extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle (ECRB), and a sham 
270 
group (n=18) who received a sham DN procedure into the ipsilateral ECRB. After a single 
271 
treatment, the DN group demonstrated significantly decreased pain (p<0.05), increased pressure 
272 
pain threshold in the trapezius (p<0.05), and increased cervical range of motion (p<0.05) 
273 
compared with the sham group.

Decreased pain and improved function following steroid injections in patients with GTPS 
275 
have also been reported. In an uncontrolled study, Ege Rasmussen and Fano11 injected 36 hips in 
276 
33 patients with methylprednisone or triamcinolone hexacetonide, interchangeably. After 1 to 3 
277 
injections, 25 patients reported excellent results and 11 reported they were improved. Shbeeb et 
278 
al33 randomly allocated 75 patients with a diagnosis of trochanteric bursitis to receive 1 of 3 
279 
conventional doses of betamethasone sodium phosphate/betamethasone acetate suspension. 
280 
Twenty, 32, and 22 patients received 6, 12, and 24 mg of betamethasone, respectively, mixed 
281 
with 4 cm3 1% lidocaine. Patients completed a functional questionnaire and visual analogue scale 
282 
for pain at 1, 6, and 26 weeks post injection. The only significant finding was that patients 
283 
treated with the highest dosage of betamethasone were more likely to experience pain relief 
284 
when compared with lower doses (p<0.0123). In an uncontrolled study, Brinks et al,5 reported 
285 
120 participants and divided them into two groups: patients who took oral analgesics as needed 
286 
(control group) and those who received an injection containing 40mg of triamcinolone acetate 
287 
combined with 1-2% lidocaine. Patients were then examined at 3 and 12 month follow-up visits 
288 
with pain severity at rest and during activity (numerical rating scale 0 to 10) and recovery (yes or 
289 
no total or major recovery) being the primary outcome measures. At 3 months, the two groups 
290 
reported clinically relevant differences in both measures; 55% recovery in the injection group 
291 
and 34% recovery in the group taking oral analgesics, and a greater decrease in pain severity was 
292 
also seen in the injection group. However, after 12 months, differences between the two groups 
293 
were no longer present, with the injection and oral analgesic group posting a 61% and 60% 
294 
recovery, respectively, as well as similar decreases in pain severity.  
295 
Our findings are consistent with studies comparing injection therapy with some form of 
296 
DN. Venancio et al44 compared the treatment effects of botulism injection, lidocaine injection,

and DN in 45 patients with headaches who were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. 
298 
All three treatment groups produced significant improvement (p<0.05) in pain intensity, 
299 
duration, and frequency, along with obtainment time and duration of relief. No statistical 
300 
difference was noted among the groups for any of these outcomes. Hong and colleagues19 
301 
studied the effects of injection with lidocaine (group I) vs. DN (group II) into a MTrP within the 
302 
upper trapezius muscle of 58 patients. Thirty-five patients received lidocaine injection while 32 
303 
received DN. Local twitch response (LTR) was elicited in 26 patients of group I and 15 patients 
304 
of group II. An LTR was not elicited in 9 patients within group I (group Ia), or 9 patients within 
305 
group II (group IIa). Treatment was re-administered to these 17 patients according to their 
306 
original group allocation, and LTR was elicited in all. Both groups I and II significantly 
307 
improved in pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, and cervical range of motion immediately 
308 
after one treatment (p<0.05). Group Ia reported significant reduction in pain after the initial 
309 
treatment, but otherwise, groups Ia and IIa did not improve significantly after the first treatment, 
310 
but did after the second (p<0.05). Hong concluded that the elicitation of a LTR is more important 
311 
than whether one chooses lidocaine or DN for treating MTrP.  Neither of these studies found 
312 
superior outcomes with the administration of CI compared with DN. 
313 
Ga et al15 did report superior outcomes with the administration of DN compared with CI. 
314 
In a single-blinded, randomized study of 39 patients diagnosed with myofascial pain syndrome 
315 
of one or both upper trapezii, Ga documented improvement in pain scores, cervical range of 
316 
motion, pressure pain threshold, and depression for patients receiving lidocaine injection and for 
317 
those receiving DN, but none of the improvements were statistically significant. Since the three 
318 
previously mentioned studies involved treatment to the cervical spine region only, they do not 
319 
offer direct comparison to outcomes in the hip.

While the literature does address the use of CI for treatment of GTPS, we found only a 
321 
case series26 and case report27 describing the effect of DN to treat GTPS. No experimental studies 
322 
investigating the response of pain or function in patients with GTPS when treated with DN, or 
323 
studies comparing the effects of DN with CI in patients with GTPS, were found, so no 
324 
comparison to our data can be made. 
325 
This study has limitations. Firstly, a sham DN procedure was not applied, so the degree 
326 
of partial blinding is questionable. Additionally, since both groups received treatment, we cannot 
327 
comment on the placebo effect. Secondly, DN was performed by a single provider, whereas CI 
328 
was provided by 1 of 5 possible providers. This presents the issue of inherent variability in the 
329 
treatment application within the CI group, but not the DN group. Furthermore, while the sample 
330 
size was greater than most experimental studies on this topic, a larger sample size would allow 
331 
smaller confidence intervals. Lastly, in an effort to control variables, this study did not allow 
332 
adjunct treatments, and provides evidence for 6 week outcomes only. Whether or not DN is a 
333 
sufficient, stand-alone treatment for alleviation of pain and return to normal function in patients 
334 
with GTPS over the long term is not addressed. Given the nature of suspected etiologies, we 
335 
recommend experimental investigation of DN in conjunction with neuromuscular re-education 
336 
over a longer time period. 
337 
Currently, evidence for DN of the hip in lieu of steroid injection is in its infancy. The 
338 
current study suggests DN as an effective alternative to CI, and utilizes a larger sample than 
339 
most, but further studies are warranted. The potential detrimental side effects of steroid injection, 
340 
particularly repeated injections, cause concern for patients and providers alike. Furthermore, 
341 
steroid use is contraindicated in the presence of certain medical conditions and some patients do

not respond positively to CI. Identification of a non-inferior treatment alternative, with minimal 
343 
side effects, such as DN, offers valuable clinical advantages.  
344 
 
345 
Conclusion 
346 
 
347 
CI to the lateral hip for GTPS did not provide greater pain relief or reduction in functional 
348 
limitations than DN. The patient demographics in this study were homogenous between groups 
349 
and the gender, age, and BMI distributions are consistent with previously documented 
350 
characteristics of patients with GTPS.  Our data suggest that DN may be a viable treatment 
351 
alternative to CI in this patient population. 
352 
 
353 
Key Points 
354 
Findings: DN to the lateral hip for GTPS was not inferior to CI for the outcomes of pain relief or 
355 
reduction in functional limitations after 6 weeks. 
356 
Implications: DN may be a viable treatment alternative to CI in this patient population. 
357 
Caution: (Limitations) Participants were followed for 6 weeks, so the maintenance of or any 
358 
further change in pain or function beyond that timeframe were not recorded for either group.

of these muscles also were assessed for 
MTrPs as indicated. These included adductor 
longus, adductor magnus, adductor brevis, 
semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and 
biceps femoris muscles. Additionally, muscles 
which might have influenced the participant’s 
loading and/or neurologically facilitated tone of 
the aforementioned muscles were needled if 
indicated. These included the lumbar multifidi, 
paraspinals, and quadratus lumborum.  
 
Needle length and diameter 
Not prespecified, but needle length typically 
ranged from 50 to 100 mm, with a 
diameter of 0.30-0.50 mm. 
Needle insertions per muscle 
The number of needle insertions per muscle 
depended on the number of MTrPs to 
be dry needled, participant’s tolerance to 
needle insertion, responsiveness of the 
tissue to dry needling, and level of post-needle 
soreness for a specific muscle. 
 
Response elicited 
Dry needling of a MTrP attempted to elicit 
sensations such as aching, soreness, 
pressure and reproduction of symptoms and, if 
possible, a local twitch response. 
 
Manipulation of the needle 
Following insertion, the needle was withdrawn 
partially and advanced repeatedly. 
 
Needle retention time 
The needle remained in the muscle for as long 
as it took to produce an appropriate 
response and was tolerated by the participant; 
the needle then was left in situ for 
approximately 5-7 minutes.

Details of the Cortisone Injection Intervention 
501 
Variable 
Description 
Injection mixture 
2ml methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-
Medrol®) 40mg/ml; 4ml 1% lidocaine; 4ml 
0.25% marcaine (10ml total) 
 
Needle length and diameter 
1 ½” 22-guage needle vs 21-guage spinal 
needle depending on the estimated lateral 
soft-tissue thickness 
Location of injection 
Point of maximal tenderness identified on the 
lateral aspect of the greater trochanter. Needle 
advanced perpendicular to skin to the level of 
bony contact, then withdrawn 2mm and 2ml 
injected. The needle was then withdrawn to 
the level of the skin and re-introduced to the 
level of the bone in the four quadrants around 
the injection site for a coverage area of 
approximately 3-4cm by 3-4 cm. 2ml were 
injected in each of the four quadrants.
