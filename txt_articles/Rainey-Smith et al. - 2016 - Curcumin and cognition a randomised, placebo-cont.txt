Abstract
Curcumin therapy in animals has produced positive cognitive and behavioural outcomes; results of human trials, however, have been
inconsistent. In this study, we report the results of a 12-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study that investigated the ability
of a curcumin formulation to prevent cognitive decline in a population of community-dwelling older adults. Individuals (n 96) ingested either
placebo or 1500 mg/d BiocurcumaxTM for 12 months. A battery of clinical and cognitive measures was administered at baseline and at the
6-month and 12-month follow-up assessments. A significant time × treatment group interaction was observed for the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (repeated-measures analysis; time × treatment; F = 3·85, P < 0·05). Subsequent analysis revealed that this association was driven by
a decline in function of the placebo group at 6 months that was not observed in the curcumin treatment group. No differences were observed
between the groups for all other clinical and cognitive measures. Our findings suggest that further longitudinal assessment is required to
investigate changes in cognitive outcome measures, ideally in conjunction with biological markers of neurodegeneration.
Key words: Curcumin: Cognition: Ageing: Alzheimer’s disease
The phytochemical curcumin, derived from the rhizome of
Curcuma longa, is a constituent of the widely used spice
turmeric(1,2).
Curcumin
has
been
extensively
reported
to
demonstrate
many
beneficial
biological
effects
including
anti-cancer, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities(2–5). In
addition to these properties, both in vitro and in vivo studies have
shown that curcumin can bind to the proteins β amyloid (Aβ) and
tau as well as inhibit Aβ aggregation and modulate tau proces-
sing(6–9). Such characteristics are highly desirable, given that cere-
bral accumulation of Aβ aggregates and intra-neuronal deposits of
insoluble hyperphosphorylated tau are pathological hallmarks of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD)(10,11), whereas both oxidative stress and
inflammation are heavily implicated in AD pathogenesis(12–14).
A recent in vitro study has demonstrated that curcumin can
induce structural changes in Aβ aggregates, which likely attenuate
Aβ-induced toxicity(15). Moreover, several in vivo studies have
shown that dietary curcumin crosses the blood–brain barrier and
subsequently decreases Aβ deposition and plaque load in
the
brain
of
transgenic
mouse
models
of
AD(8,16–18).
Additional transgenic mouse studies have demonstrated marked
inhibition of tau phosphorylation(19), reduced soluble tau and
elevated levels of molecular chaperones (heat shock proteins)
involved in tau degradation(7) following curcumin therapy. These
Aβ- and tau-modifying attributes, as well as its anti-inflammatory
and antioxidant properties, in combination with an excellent
safety profile, have helped make curcumin an appealing target
for studies aimed at developing AD prevention and intervention
strategies.
Indeed, investigations of the effect of curcumin therapy on
cognition and behaviour in animals have revealed positive
functional outcomes. Pre-treatment with dietary curcumin, at
a dose of 500 parts per million (ppm) for 2 months, prevented Aβ
infusion-induced spatial memory deficits in middle-aged female
Sprague–Dawley rats(20). Ma et al. observed prevention of
cognitive decline in tests of working memory in curcumin-treated
(500ppm, 4 months) 3xTg-AD mice on a high-fat diet(19), whereas
chronic curcumin administration (500ppm) has also been shown to
suppress behavioural deficits in aged human tau transgenic mice(7).
Despite the apparent consensus of promising results among
animal studies, these findings have not been translated fully to

 human studies. An epidemiological study reported better global
cognition, as determined by the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) score, among elderly Singaporean individuals con-
suming higher levels of curcumin in the form of curry compared
with those who ‘never or rarely’ consume curcumin(21).
Two subsequent 6-month, randomised, placebo-controlled,
double-blinded studies conducted in early-to-moderate AD
patients found curcumin formulations to be well tolerated and
safe; however, no differences in measures were observed
between
treatment
groups(22,23).
The
outcome
measures
included MMSE, the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale,
cognitive sub-portion, the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative
Study Activities of Daily Living and blood Aβ, as well as
cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ and tau species. The authors
listed limited bioavailability of curcumin (due to dose or
formulation), short duration of the studies and the fact that these
trials were conducted on individuals already diagnosed with AD
in whom cerebral pathology would be considerably advanced
as possible explanations for the lack of significant results.
In contrast, a recent 4-week, randomised, placebo-controlled,
double-blinded study of sixty healthy adults aged 60–85 years
showed improved working memory and mood in the curcumin
treatment group. Evaluation of the acute effects of curcumin
treatment also revealed improved performance on tasks of
working memory and attention compared with placebo as
early as 1 h after ingestion(24). Participants in the curcumin
group received a single daily dose of 400 mg Longvida®
Optimized Curcumin (Verdure Sciences) – a formulation with
previously
demonstrated
bioavailability(25,26).
Whether
the
observed beneficial effects of curcumin persist longitudinally,
however, remains to be determined.
To date, no longitudinal assessment of the effect of curcumin
on cognition in a population of aged community-dwelling
cognitively healthy individuals has been undertaken. Conse-
quently, the aim of the present study was to conduct a 12-month,
randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study in order
to investigate the ability of the curcumin formulation Biocurcu-
maxTM (Arjuna Natural Extracts Ltd) to prevent cognitive decline
in a population of community-dwelling older adults. Cognitively
healthy older adults were recruited as they represent a population
both at risk of developing clinical AD, yet in whom the preclinical
disease stage is believed to be early enough to still be responsive
to intervention(27). The curcumin formulation BiocurcumaxTM was
selected based on its enhanced oral bioavailability; after ingestion
of 2 g BiocurcumaxTM, a plasma curcumin concentration of
300 ng/g is reached(28); however, participants of the present study
were given a dose of 1·5 g.
Methods
Participants
In all, 160 community-dwelling older adults were enrolled in to
the study at the McCusker Alzheimer’s Research Foundation,
Western Australia. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age
40–90 years, with good health and no significant cerebral
vascular disease; no significant cognitive impairments as
indicated by the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline
in the Elderly or by objective memory assessment measures;
normal general cognitive function as indicated by a Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score ≥26; and no or minimal
impairment in activities of daily living, as determined by a
clinical interview and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey
(SF-36)(29). Individuals with a MoCA score of 18–25 were
discussed by a team of neuropsychologists, and eligibility was
determined on a case-by-case basis following stratification of
the MoCA score according to age and education(30). Exclusion
criteria included the following: the presence of dementia
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4th edition(31); previous medical history of stroke;
current depressive symptoms based on the Depression Anxiety
Stress Scales (DASS)(32); presence of acute or untreated chronic
psychiatric disorders (including drug and alcohol abuse);
anti-coagulant or anti-platelet treatment or bleeding risk factors;
obstruction of the biliary tract; and non-fluency in English.
This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid
down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures
involving human subjects were approved by the Human
Research Ethics Committee of Hollywood Private Hospital,
Western Australia. Written informed consent was obtained
from all subjects. The present study is registered with the
Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR;
http://www.anzctr.org.au/)
under
identification
number
ACTRN12611000437965.
Intervention
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was
conducted for a period of 12 months. Eligible participants were
identified according to age and sex before being randomly
assigned into either the curcumin (n 80) or the placebo (n 80)
treatment groups. The curcumin group ingested 1 × 500 mg
BCM-95®CG (BiocurcumaxTM) capsule three times a day
(1500 mg/d total), after meals with water. The placebo group
ingested 1 × placebo capsule three times a day, after meals
with water. The placebo (roasted rice powder with no active
constituents) and BCM-95®CG capsules were identical in size
and appearance (green-coloured hard gelatin shell of ‘0’ size).
Each BCM-95®CG capsule contained 88 % total curcuminoids
(curcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin) and
7 % volatile oils from rhizomes of C. longa Linn. Participants
visited the research centre at 3 monthly intervals to return
completed capsule diaries and used capsule bottles and to
collect a new capsule diary and the following 3 months’ capsule
supply. The completed capsule diaries and a count of returned
capsules were used to assess intervention compliance. Only the
data of participants reaching an intervention compliance
threshold of ≥70 % were included in the analysis.
Cognitive and clinical assessment
Comprehensive medical history was captured at baseline by
participant self-report, and was subsequently updated at the
6- and 12-month follow-ups. Measurements of blood pressure
(mmHg) and weight (kg) were obtained from each participant
at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. Pre-morbid verbal

 intelligence was determined at baseline using the Cambridge
Contextual Reading Test(33).
Recent mood was assessed by administration of the DASS(34) at
baseline and at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Participant
self-reported assessment of physical and mental health at all time
points was obtained using the SF-36(29). The frequency with which
participants made errors in prospective as well as retrospective
short-term and long-term memory was assessed at baseline and at
6 and 12 months using the sixteen-item self-report Prospective and
Retrospective Memory Questionnaire(35).
An array of cognitive measures was administered at baseline
and at the 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments. The MoCA
was used to assess general cognitive function(36). Verbal
learning and memory were examined using the Rey Auditory
Verbal Learning Test(37) to provide scores for short-term,
long-term and recognition retrieval from memory. Verbal
fluency
was
assessed
using
the
Controlled
Oral
Word
Association Test(38). The Wechsler Digit Symbol Scale from the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale revised (WAIS-R)(39) was also
administered as a measure of perceptual motor speed. A
cognitive composite score (non-computerised) was calculated
for each participant by converting the raw scores of the tests
listed above to overall sample-based Z scores, and then
averaging the Z scores to compute a single composite score.
The computerised CogState battery (CogState) was also
administered to each participant at baseline and at the 6- and
12-month follow-ups. CogState tasks included the following:
detection, assessing psychomotor speed; one back task to
measure working memory; Groton maze learning (GML) for
executive functions; GML test recall for identification; and one
card learning and the continuous paired associate learning tasks
for assessing visual memory. The raw scores of the individual
computerised tests were converted to sample-based Z scores,
which were then averaged to produce a single computerised
composite score.
APOE genotyping
Genotyping was conducted on participants’ DNA samples,
which had previously been isolated from whole blood samples
using a QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. APOE genotype was determined
through TaqMan® genotyping assays (Life Technologies) for
rs7412 (Assay ID C____904973_10) and rs429358 (Assay
ID C___3084793_20). TaqMan® assays were performed on a
ViiA™ 7 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 22
for Windows Vista (SPSS Inc.). A P value of <0·05 determined a
significant result for all analyses. Descriptive data analyses (Table 1)
were undertaken to provide means, standard deviations and
percentages for the treatment and placebo groups. For the
evaluation of differences between these groups, independent
sample t tests were performed to analyse continuous data
and χ2 tests to analyse categorical data. Repeated-measures
ANCOVA was utilised to measure the effect of treatment on
change in all measures from baseline to the 6- and 12-month
follow-ups. All models included age, sex, years of education and
APOE ε4 allele carriage as covariates. Treatment groups were
unblinded following completion of data analysis.
Results
A total of 160 participants were enrolled in to the present
study; forty-nine participants were excluded before study
completion either because of a baseline assessment result that
deemed the participant ineligible to remain in the study
(six participants), a suspected adverse event (twenty-three
participants; gastrointestinal complaints accounted for the
majority of adverse events), or because of other personal
or medical reasons unrelated to study participation (twenty
participants). Furthermore, an additional eight participants were
excluded mid-study because of low intervention compliance
rates (<70 %), and the data of a further seven participants who
completed the study were excluded from the analysis because
of late-onset intervention non-compliance. Compliance rates
were based on returned capsule counts and participant capsule
logs; ninety-six participants who met all inclusion, exclusion
and compliance criteria were included in the present analysis.
Fig. 1 provides a summary of the study cohort at all assessment
time points and includes a breakdown of reasons for participant
exclusion at each stage.
No
differences
between
the
treatment
and
placebo
groups were observed in terms of the demographic and medical
history variables evaluated (Table 1). Nevertheless, the placebo
group performed significantly better at baseline in the digit
symbol task (t = 2·98, P < 0·01), the MoCA (t = 2·10, P < 0·05)
and cognitive composite (non-computerised) scores (t = 2·40,
P < 0·05), the latter of which was mainly driven by the MoCA
and digit symbol scores. As shown in Table 2, there were no
significant interactions of time × treatment group for measures
of physical health, mental health, mood and self-reported
memory function.
Table 3 contains the results of the repeated-measures
analysis, evaluating the effect of BCM-95®CG on cognitive
performance across the three time-points; baseline, 6 months
and 12 months. The time × treatment variable was significant for
the MoCA score (time × treatment; F = 3·85, P < 0·05; Table 3
and Fig. 2); however, it is important to note that the time
variable itself was not significant (F = 1·64, P = 0·20). Mean
MoCA scores improved by 0·64 points in the curcumin group
and by 0·09 points in the placebo group from baseline to
12 months (Table 3 and Fig. 2). To assess whether the
significant
interaction
observed
in
the
repeated-measures
analysis was driven by the decreased performance of the
placebo group at the 6-month follow-up (a result not consistent
with the 12-month follow-up assessment; Table 3 and Fig. 2),
the analysis was re-run excluding the 6-month MoCA scores for
both treatment groups. Using baseline and 12-month MoCA
performance only, no significant interaction between time
and
treatment
groups
was
observed
(F = 1·36,
P = 0·25;
Table 3). No other differences in cognitive test performance
were observed across the treatment groups.

 Discussion
This study sought to investigate the effect of a 12-month dietary
supplementation of curcumin on cognitive function in a cohort
of aged, community-dwelling, cognitively healthy individuals.
Furthermore, we examined the influence of curcumin on mood
and general quality of life. We observed no differences in
placebo
and
treatment
groups
in
changes
in
cognitive
performance
from
baseline
to
the
12-month
follow-up.
However, a significant time × treatment group interaction was
observed for the MoCA. Subsequent analysis revealed that this
association was driven by a decline in function within the

Curcumin and cognition in older adults

 placebo group at the 6-month follow-up that was not observed
in the curcumin treatment group. No differences were observed
between the treatment groups in all other clinical and cognitive
measures.
A large body of animal studies supports the hypothesis that
curcumin is beneficial for cognitive health(40–42). A paucity of
evidence is present, however, to support the proposed bene-
ficial effect of curcumin on cognition in humans(21,24). In the
present study, we found no between-treatment group differ-
ences in measures of cognition over 12 months. Nevertheless, a
decrease in MoCA performance (used to assess general cogni-
tive function) at the 6-month follow-up compared with baseline
was observed in the placebo group, which did not manifest in
the curcumin treatment group, contributing to a significant
time × treatment interaction. Furthermore, at baseline, the pla-
cebo group performed significantly better on the MoCA than the
curcumin group; however, at 12 months, the MoCA score of
both groups was equivalent. Our results differ from a recent
study by Cox et al.(24), who reported a beneficial effect of acute
(1 h after single dose) and chronic (4-week treatment) curcumin
treatment on working memory. It should be noted that the effect
of curcumin on cognition after 4 weeks of treatment was trend
level (unadjusted, reaching significance after adjustment), and
that only one task (not administered in the current study), out of
a number of cognitive tasks assessed, was shown to be influ-
enced by curcumin treatment. The authors attribute the acute
positive effect of curcumin to an up-regulation of mono-
aminergic neurotransmission. It is possible that short-term
effects of curcumin on cognition may indeed be due to
increased levels of neurotransmitters; however, whether such

Divergent
methodologies,
most notably, study duration and use of different curcumin
formulations, between the present study and that of Cox et al.
may account for the differing results.
In the present study, we hypothesised that curcumin would
have an effect on attenuating cognitive decline, rather than a
direct effect on improving cognitive function. Nevertheless, in
our highly educated cohort, we observed little cognitive decline
on any tasks in either the placebo or the treatment group. Even
though the cognitive battery was carefully selected to assess
numerous cognitive functions including global cognition, epi-
sodic verbal memory, executive function, working memory and
attention, and verbal fluency, it is possible that the magnitude of
change exhibited by our high-functioning cohort was too small
to be detected. The cognitive performance of our cohort over
the follow-up period is, however, consistent with previous
reports of a cognitively healthy cohort demonstrating a lack of
cognitive decline over 12 months(43). In an attempt to gain a
greater understanding of the effect of curcumin on cognition,
future studies should consider longer intervention duration than
that used in the present study. Furthermore, with longer
periods of follow-up or with investigation of an even older
cohort at increased risk of cognitive decline, the effect of
curcumin treatment on cognition may be more pronounced.
Such approaches would also facilitate examination of the
effect of curcumin therapy on rate of conversion to mild
cognitive impairment or AD, and are feasible considering the
excellent safety profile and general tolerability of the curcumin
formulation utilised.
A
number
of
animal
and
human
studies
indicate
that
curcumin has a positive effect on symptoms of depression and
anxiety(44–48). In the present study, however, curcumin was not
shown to influence self-reported measures of depressive and
anxiety-related symptoms over 12 months; this result is not
entirely unexpected, given that individuals with current depressive
symptoms were excluded from the study. Although the majority of
human studies yielding positive results in the context of depression
and anxiety symptoms were conducted on individuals with major
depressive disorder(44–46), one study showed an improvement
in self-reports of mood among non-depressed individuals, after
a 4-week curcumin intervention(24).
Bioavailability is an important consideration in studies of
curcumin
supplementation.
Poor
absorption
of
orally
administered curcumin as well as rapid metabolism in the
intestine and liver have long been identified as limitations of
curcumin therapy. Thus, a great deal of research activity has
focused on the development of formulations, which are more
readily absorbed and yield increased levels of curcumin in its
unconjugated form. The varying pharmacokinetics of different
curcumin formulations likely contributes to the heterogeneity of
results among studies of curcumin in humans. Indeed, Ringman
et al.(23) were unable to determine whether the lack of efficacy
observed following Curcumin C3 Complex® (Sabinsa Corpora-
tion) administration was due to inefficacy of curcumin as an AD
intervention or due to limited bioavailability of the formulation
as evidenced by biochemical analysis of blood and cere-
brospinal fluid samples. Cox et al.(24) utilised Longvida®
Optimized Curcumin in their investigation of the effect of
curcumin on cognition and mood in healthy older adults; in
contrast, the present study utilised BiocurcumaxTM. Both the
Longvida® and BiocurcumaxTM formulations are reported to
reach plasma concentrations of free curcumin, which are
significantly greater than that of unformulated curcumin; there
are, however, between-formulation differences in pharmaco-
kinetic parameters such as reported peak plasma concentration,
time to peak concentration and elimination rate(25,28). The
curcumin formulation, dosage and frequency of administration
are all likely to have impacted the results of the present and
previous studies. It is also important to note that the therapeutic
concentration of curcumin with regard to enhancing cognition
requires further investigation. Although previous reports from
Cox et al. describe a positive effect of a daily dose of 400 mg of
the Longvida® formulation on cognition, more research in
larger cohorts with longer intervention periods is required to
identify a therapeutic dose. The three times daily 500 mg
BiocurcumaxTM dose utilised in the present study to sustain
optimum curcumin blood levels may have also impacted upon
intervention
compliance
and
tolerability,
contributing
to
the number of gastrointestinal-related adverse events and sub-
sequent participant withdrawal from the study. Nevertheless, it
is unclear whether the high adverse event rate was due to the
nature of the BiocurcumaxTM formulation or curcumin itself.
At
study
commencement,
participants
were
blinded
to
curcumin
consumption;
steady
increase
to
the
eventual
BiocurcumaxTM daily dose would have likely reduced the
number of participant withdrawals. Indeed, we are currently
using this incremental BiocurcumaxTM dosage approach as part
of a sister study investigating the role of curcumin in preventing
AD (ANZCTR identification number: ACTRN12613000681752),
with excellent intervention tolerability observed to date.
Although the results of the present study indicate that, in this
cohort of cognitively normal older adults, curcumin had limited
influence on cognitive function, mood or general quality of
life over 12 months, it is important to note that alterations in
cognition manifest up to 20 years after the commencement of
AD-related neuropathological changes. Furthermore, other
studies have demonstrated positive effects of curcumin on Aβ,
tau, inflammation and oxidative stress – factors well known to
be associated with AD pathogenesis and pathology(2,7–9). Thus,
additional longitudinal studies, which include measurement of
biological markers of AD pathology, are warranted, in order to
fully elucidate the ability of curcumin to slow neurodegenera-
tion leading to cognitive decline and AD.
