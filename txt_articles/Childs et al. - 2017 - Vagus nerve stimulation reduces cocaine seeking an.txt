Drugs of abuse cause changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and associated regions that impair inhibitory control over drug-
seeking. Breaking the contingencies between drug-associated cues and the delivery of the reward during extinction learning
reduces rates of relapse. Here we used vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to induce targeted synaptic plasticity to facilitate ex-
tinction of appetitive behaviors and to reduce relapse. Rats self-administered cocaine and were given VNS during extinction.
Relapse to drug-seeking was assessed in a cued reinstatement session. We used immunohistochemistry to measure changes in
the expression of the phosphorylated transcription factor cAMP response-element binding protein (pCREB) in the PFC and
the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which regulate cue learning and extinction. In vivo recordings of evoked field potentials
measured drug- and VNS-induced changes in metaplasticity in the pathway from the PFC to the BLA. VNS-treated rats
showed improved rates of extinction and reduced reinstatement. Following reinstatement, pCREB levels were reduced
in the IL and BLA of VNS-treated rats. Evoked responses in the BLA were greatly reduced in VNS-treated rats, and
these rats were also resistant to the induction of LTD. Taken together, these results show that VNS facilitates extinc-
tion and reduces reinstatement. Changes in the pathway between the PFC and the amygdala may contribute to these ben-
eficial effects.
Cocaine addiction is characterized by an impaired ability to
develop adaptive behaviors that can compete with cocaine seek-
ing, implying a deficit in the ability to induce plasticity in net-
works that regulate motivated behavior (Moussawi et al. 2009).
As a result of this, recovery from drug addiction is frequently ham-
pered by craving and relapse. Learning to inhibit, or extinguish,
drug-seeking in response to drug-associated cues can reduce
relapse. Extinction can reverse neuroadaptations caused by
drug self-administration (Self et al. 2004; Millan et al. 2011).
However, extinction training alone is often insufficient to prevent
drug relapse (Weiss et al. 2001; Conklin and Tiffany 2002), poten-
tially because the corticolimbic networks that are important for
cue and reward processing, which include the nucleus accum-
bens, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the amygdala (Jentsch
and Taylor 1999), become dysregulated by chronic drug use them-
selves (Fowler et al. 2007; Sinha and Li 2007; Liu et al. 2009; Nic
Dhonnchadha and Kantak 2011). Modulating extinction process-
es to better consolidate the new-formed memories thus has clini-
cal potential to reshape maladaptive behavior and to prevent
relapse (Taylor et al. 2009). Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a
minimally invasive neuroprosthetic treatment which can induce
targeted plasticity in active networks (Hays et al. 2013). VNS is
FDA-approved for the treatment of epilepsy and depression, and
it can improve sensory and motor function in models of tinnitus
and stroke (Engineer et al. 2011; Porter et al. 2012; Hays et al.
2014a,b). VNS has also already been shown to facilitate extinction
of conditioned fear (Pen
˜a et al. 2013, 2014), but an important
open question is whether these effects also apply to the extinction
of appetitive behaviors.
In addition, little is known about how VNS modulates syn-
aptic plasticity that underlies extinction learning. Cue-learning
and extinction of both aversive and rewarding stimuli involves
activity in the pathway between the medial PFC and the basolat-
eral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) (Quirk and Mueller 2008;
Sierra-Mercado et al. 2011). We have previously shown that pair-
ing VNS with extinction of conditioned fear leads to metaplastic-
ity (changes in the ability to induce LTP or LTD) in the pathway
from the infralimbic cortex (IL) to the BLA (Pen
˜a et al. 2014).
Here we tested the effect of VNS on extinction from cocaine self-
administration and examined changes in synaptic plasticity in a
part of the extinction network that controls cue-induced rein-
statement. Our results show that VNS reduces cue-induced rein-
statement without affecting ongoing appetitive behaviors. To
examine VNS-induced changes in the network important for
cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking, we used immunohis-
tochemistry for the phosphorylated form of the transcription fac-
tor cAMP response-element binding protein (pCREB), as well as in
vivo electrophysiological recordings of synaptic plasticity in the
IL � BLA pathway following cued reinstatement. VNS-treated
rats had reduced pCREB expression in the IL and BLA compared
with sham-stimulated rats. Recordings of evoked local field poten-
tials in the IL � BLA pathway furthermore showed that pairing
VNS with extinction from cocaine seeking (but not extinction
by itself) reduced the ability to induce LTD in this pathway.
Taken together, our results suggest that VNS can reduce cocaine
seeking by regulating activity in the mPFC–BLA network.

 ncVNS, cVNS, or a period of abstinence. After 12 d of extinction or
abstinence, reinstatement to drug-seeking was measured in a cued
reinstatement session by presenting the conditioned drug cues
(Fig. 1). Over 10 d of drug self-administration rats in all groups
(sham, n ¼ 20; ncVNS, n ¼ 20; cVNS, n ¼ 8; abstinent, n ¼ 9;
drug only, n ¼ 10) showed similar rates of responses on the active
lever (F(1,61) ¼ 0.76, P ¼ 0.555), and responses on the active lever
exceeded responses on the inactive lever in all groups (sham,
F(1,38) ¼ 73. 233, P , 0.001; ncVNS, F(1,38) ¼ 68.296, P , 0.001;
cVNS, F(1,14) ¼ 23.371, P ¼ ,0.001; abstinent, F(1,16) ¼ 13.091,
P ¼ 0.002; drug only, F(1,18) ¼ 124.808, P , 0.001). During extinc-
tion, responses to the previously active lever were measured and
used as an indicator of extinction learning. Sham-stimulated
rats showed higher levels of responding during the 12 d extinction
period than ncVNS rats (F(1,38) ¼ 8.203, P ¼ 0.007, Fig. 1A). No dif-
ference was found between sham-stimulated and cVNS rats during
extinction (F(1,25) ¼ 2.71, P ¼ 0.112, Fig. 1B). Twenty-four hours
after the last extinction session, drug-seeking was reinstated in a
cued reinstatement session. Abstinent rats showed higher re-
sponse rates during reinstatement than sham-stimulated rats
(t(27) ¼ 3.264, P ¼ 0.003, Fig. 1C), however, pairing extinction
training with VNS significantly facilitated extinction learning
and further reduced relapse during cue-primed reinstatement.
Both ncVNS rats (t(38) ¼ 2.769, P ¼ 0.009, Fig. 1A) and cVNS rats
(t(25) ¼ 2.254, P ¼ 0.033, Fig. 1B) showed fewer responses at the ac-
tive lever during cued reinstatement than sham-stimulated rats.
VNS does not impact ongoing appetitive behavior
To exclude the possibility that the immediate and precipitous re-
duction in drug-seeking behavior on the first day of extinction re-
sulted from unspecific motor or aversive effects of VNS, we applied
VNS during appetitive responding to either food- or drug rewards.
We trained rats to self-administer food (n ¼ 6), or cocaine (n ¼ 6),
and applied VNS at different points during self-administration
(Fig. 2). Because rats showed very high response rates during
food self-administration, we used this opportunity to test the ef-
fects of VNS delivered contingently with each lever press
(cVNS). Cocaine self-administering rats received ncVNS through-
out their training sessions. We compared differences in response
rates over a baseline period of self-administration without VNS
(5 d food/10 d drug) to a 5 d period of self-administration with
VNS. Response rates at the active lever were unaltered by VNS dur-
ing both cocaine (F(1,10) , 0.001, P ¼ 0.985) and food self-
administration (F(1,10) ¼ 0.630, P ¼ 0.446). These results suggest
that application of VNS is neither rewarding nor punishing, and
does not affect ongoing appetitive behavior.
VNS enhances extinction from food-seeking
To test whether the effects of VNS on extinction learning are
specific to drug-seeking, we also delivered VNS to rats that extin-
guished from operant food self-administration (Fig. 3). Rats were
allowed to self-administer food pellets for 5 d. No difference
was found in rates of food self-administration between sham-
stimulated
(n ¼ 10)
and
VNS
(n ¼ 10)
rats
(F(1,18) , 0.001,
P ¼ 0.990). As in extinction from drug self-administration, VNS
delivered during extinction from food self-administration facili-
tated extinction learning of the operant response. During 5 d of
extinction, sham-stimulated rats had more responses on the pre-
viously active lever than ncVNS rats (F(1,18) ¼ 6.365, P ¼ 0.021).
Similarly, sham-stimulated rats showed higher absolute response
rates during the cue-induced reinstatement session compared
with ncVNS rats (t(18) ¼ 2.511, P ¼ 0.022). However, overall rats
in both groups showed relatively little reinstatement, so that re-
sponse rates at the active lever during the reinstatement session
were not significantly different from those on the last day of ex-
tinction. These results imply that VNS may facilitate extinction
across a wide range of reinforcers, including heroin (Liu et al.
2011), and food (present data), as well as aversive stimuli (Pen
˜a
et al. 2013, 2014).
VNS reduces pCREB expression in IL and BLA

tion, extinction, and reinstatement (Zhou and Zhu 2006). To

 determine how VNS affects network activity in regions important
for cue extinction, we measured levels of pCREB in the PL, IL, and
BLA immediately after cue-induced reinstatement (Fig. 4). A
repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of treatment
in the PL (F(1,23) ¼ 6.174, P ¼ 0.003). Drug-naı
¨ve rats (n ¼ 6) ex-
pressed less pCREB than drug-only and sham-stimulated groups
(BonferroniDrugOnly P ¼ 0.029, n ¼ 5; BonferroniSham P ¼ 0.029,
n ¼ 7). There was no difference between drug-naive and VNS
rats in the PL (BonferroniVNS P ¼ 0.162, n ¼ 9). No difference
was found in any other comparisons in the PL (Bonferroni P .
0.05). In the IL, treatment also showed a main effect (F(1,23) ¼
8.956, P ¼ 0.0004), with drug-only and sham-stimulated groups
showing higher expression levels of pCREB than drug-naı
¨ve
rats (BonferroniDrugOnly P ¼ 0.009; BonferroniSham P ¼ 0.0004).
No difference was found between drug-naı
¨ve rats and VNS
rats (BonferroniVNS P ¼ 0.198). VNS rats expressed less pCREB
than sham-stimulated rats (Bonferroni P ¼ 0.039), but were
not different from drug-only subjects (Bonferroni P ¼ 0.518).
In the BLA, treatment also showed a main effect (F(1,23) ¼
7.988, P ¼ 0.001). Post hoc analysis showed that drug-naive rats
expressed less pCREB in the BLA than drug-only and sham-
stimulated rats (BonferroniDrugOnly P ¼ 0.031, BonferroniSham
P ¼ 0.015). VNS rats were not different from drug-naı
¨ve rats
(Bonferronidrug-naı
¨ve P ¼ 1), but expressed significantly less pCREB
in
the
BLA
than
drug-only
and
sham-stimulated
rats
(BonferroniDrugOnly P ¼ 0.015; BonferroniShamP ¼ 0.006). Across
all three regions (PL, IL, BLA) drug-only and sham-stimulated rats
showed similar trends (Bonferroni ¼ 1). Importantly, following
VNS, pCREB expression in the BLA was different from both
drug-onlyandsham-stimulatedrats,andwasreducedtolevelssim-
ilar to those seen in drug-naı
¨ve rats. In the somatosensory cortex
(S1) no differences were found between any treatment groups
(F(1,20) ¼ 0.836, P ¼ 0.490), suggesting that treatment-dependent
differencesseenintheotherbrainregionsare specifictotheextinc-
tion circuit.
VNS alters plasticity in the extinction circuit
We have previously shown that VNS facilitates extinction of con-
ditioned fear and alters the synaptic plasticity in the pathway be-
tween the IL and the BLA (12). The projection between the IL and
the BLA is also important for the extinction of cue-induced drug-
seeking behavior (26). To test whether VNS induces changes in
synaptic plasticity in this pathway when given during extinction
from drug-seeking, we stimulated the IL and recorded eLFPs in the
BLA following reinstatement (Fig. 5). A two-way ANOVA of the re-
lationship between stimulation intensity
(0.4 mA–2.0 mA) and amplitude of the
baseline eLFP revealed a main effect of
treatment on these I–O curves (F(1,21) ¼
3.460, P ¼ 0.025), with VNS rats having
significantly smaller baseline responses
than
drug-naı
¨ve
and
abstinent
rats
(LSDdrug-naive P ¼ 0.006; LSDAbstinent P ¼
0.006, LSDSham P ¼ 0.390, LSDDrugOnly
P ¼ 0.068).
Next,
we
applied
low-
frequency stimulation (LFS) designed to
induce LTD. In drug-naı
¨ve (n ¼ 6) and
sham-stimulated (n ¼ 8) rats, LFS reliably
induced LTD (drug-naı
¨ve, F(1,10) ¼ 8.128,
P ¼ 0.017;
sham-stimulated,
F(1,14) ¼
5.535, P ¼ 0.034). In contrast, rats that
received ncVNS during extinction train-
ing (n ¼ 9) were resistant to the induc-
tion of LTD, showing little change in
eLFP amplitude from baseline (F(1,16) ¼
2.605, P ¼ 0.170). Abstinent rats (n ¼ 5) also showed no difference
between baseline and post-LFS amplitude (F(1,8) ¼ 2.063, P ¼
0.189). A fifth group (drug-only) was recorded 24 h after the last
drug self-administration session, without receiving any extinc-
tion training (n ¼ 7). This group also showed no differences be-
tween the baseline and post-LFS response (F(1,12) ¼ 0.503, P ¼
0.492, Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data show that combining
extinction training with VNS alters the responsiveness of the
BLA to IL inputs and changes the parameters for induction of
LTD in the IL � BLA pathway. However, drug taking alone also al-
ters synaptic plasticity in this pathway.

Vagus nerve stimulation does not alter ongoing appetitive behavior. Rats were trained to
self-administer cocaine (A) or food pellets (B). After a stable rate of response was reached, rats were
given VNS during self-administration sessions to see whether this changes response patterns. Rats
that self-administered cocaine received noncontingent VNS, while rats that self-administered food re-
ceived contingent VNS with each lever press. Responses at the active lever during self-administration
were not altered by VNS.

then underwent extinction training for 5 d while they received either

during a reinstatement session (R). Compared with sham-stimulated
rats VNS rats made fewer responses at the active lever during extinction
and during the cue-induced reinstatement session. However, rats in
both groups showed only small, nonsignificant increases in responses
during cue-induced reinstatement when compared with the last day of
extinction . P values are (∗) ,0.05. Inset shows a detail of the extinction

 stimuli. However, this type of exposure therapy for drug addiction
is not consistently effective (Dutra et al. 2008), potentially
because the brain areas required for extinction learning may be-
come impaired by drug use (Nic Dhonnchadha et al. 2008; Liu
et al. 2009; Kantak and Nic Dhonnchadha, 2011). Extinction
alone can reverse some of the maladaptive changes caused by
drug use (Self et al. 2004); thus, enhancing extinction learning
may improve clinical outcomes (Taylor et al. 2009). Here, we ad-
ministered VNS during extinction from cocaine- and food-seeking
and found enhanced extinction and reduced reinstatement com-
pared with sham-stimulated rats. Importantly, ongoing appetitive
behavior was not altered by VNS, supporting previous reports that
VNS is tolerated well (Handforth et al. 1998).
We previously found that VNS enhances extinction from
conditioned fear (Pen
˜a et al. 2014). Here we show that VNS can
also facilitate extinction from drug-seeking and from food self-
administration. A recent study also indicated that VNS can reduce
relapse to heroin seeking (Liu et al. 2011). Taken together, these
data suggest that VNS can be used to modulate extinction from
a wide range of reinforcers. This is important for both our under-
standing of the mechanisms of VNS, as well as the prevention of
relapse to drug seeking, because the mechanisms and networks
that underlie extinction from psychostimulant and opiate self-
administration are thought to be at least partially different, with
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex acting as neural OFF switch
for cocaine seeking, but an ON switch for heroin seeking
(Ettenberg et al. 1982; Peters et al. 2013).
In addition, VNS administered either contingent with non-
reinforced lever presses or noncontingently throughout the ex-
tinction
sessions
reduced
reinstatement
to
equal
degrees,
suggesting that VNS may function both by enhancing learning
about the operant response, and/or by enhancing contextual
learning, as previously suggested (Pen
˜a et al. 2014). The fact that
VNS can facilitate extinction from various reinforcers and across
a range of stimulation parameters is consistent with the idea
that VNS promotes plasticity by altering neurotransmission selec-
tively in those brain regions actively engaged in a task (Kilgard
2012; Childs et al. 2015). Temporally precise modulation of active
networks could explain how the effects of VNS can generalize to
motor functions, as well as a range of conditioned and uncondi-
tioned stimuli (Engineer et al. 2011; Porter et al. 2012; Hays
et al. 2014a,b).

 Activation of the mesocorticolimbic system, including dopa-
minergic and glutamatergic pathways that connect the ven-
tral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and PFC,
constitutes a common pathway through which various drugs of
abuse mediate their reinforcing effects (Nestler 2009). Long-
term neuroadaptations in this circuitry underlie the transition
to drug dependence and cycles of relapse. As an initial test of
the mechanisms that underlie VNS-enhanced extinction, we mea-
sured levels of pCREB in the mPFC and BLA to infer activity levels
during reinstatement. Decreases in pCREB expression in the PFC
were previously found following drug-induced reinstatement of
morphine-conditioned place preference (Zhou and Zhu 2006).
Deactivation studies using local application of drugs or focal le-
sions (Weissenborn et al. 1997; McFarland and Kalivas 2001;
McLaughlin and See 2003; Peters et al. 2008) suggest that in the
mPFC of rodents a dorsal-ventral distinction exists, wherein the
PL drives the expression of both fear and drug-seeking, whereas
the IL suppresses these behaviors after extinction (Peters et al.
2008, 2009). The distinct effects of IL and PL on extinction and re-
instatement of drug-seeking are mediated, at least in part, through
neuroadaptations in anatomically distinct projections to the nu-
cleus accumbens core (from PL) and shell (from IL), respectively
(Self et al. 2004; Peters et al. 2008, 2009; Moussawi et al. 2009;
Knackstedt et al. 2010). In addition, recent electrophysiological
analyses show that neuronal networks within PL and IL can con-
tribute to both response execution and inhibition, suggesting that
neurons in both regions encode context-appropriate responses,
firing more strongly for a “Go” response during reward seeking
and for a “No-Go” response during extinction (Moorman and
Aston-Jones 2014; Moorman et al. 2015). Our immunohisto-
chemical analysis of pCREB expression is seemingly at odds with
a simple functional dichotomy of the mPFC subregions: While
our main finding was that pairing VNS with extinction reduced
pCREB expression in the extinction network compared with
sham-stimulated subjects, the pattern of these changes did not
differ between IL and PL. However, it is important to note that
we studied pCREB expression after the cue-induced reinstatement
session, which shows characteristics of both drug-seeking (initiat-
ed by presentation of the cues) and intra-session extinction
(caused by the absence of drug reinforcement). Thus while
pCREB expression can serve as a general marker for VNS-induced
changes in activity in the extinction circuit, it may not be

 sufficient to distinguish the different roles of multiple overlap-
ping networks in the IL and PL. When pairing VNS with extinc-
tion we observed the largest reduction of pCREB expression in
the BLA. To further examine how VNS changes plasticity in the ex-
tinction circuit, we performed in vivo recordings in the IL � BLA
pathway, which is important for the formation of discrete stimu-
lus–reward associations (See 2005) and the expression of extinc-
tion behavior (Peters et al. 2008; Rogers et al. 2008; Kruzich and
See 2001). In VNS-treated rats, which showed reduced reinstate-
ment of drug seeking, we observed diminished responsiveness of
the BLA to IL stimulation. Furthermore, pairing extinction with
VNS caused a shift in metaplasticity, making the IL � BLA path-
way resistant to LTD induction. This parallels VNS-induced
changes in the extinction circuit for conditioned fear (Pen
˜a
et al. 2014). The reduction in the baseline response may result
in a “floor effect” that prevents further depotentiation during
LTD induction. In rats that only underwent self-administration
(drug-only) and abstinent subjects that had no extinction train-
ing, the IL � BLA pathway was also resistant to LTD induction,
despite larger baseline responses seen in these groups. This sug-
gests differences in the ability to induce plasticity in the BLA dur-
ing each of the phases of the self-administration/extinction
paradigm, that are caused by either the drug itself, learned
cue-reward associations, or extinction learning. This is again
similar to what is seen in the IL � BLA pathway during fear con-
ditioning and extinction from conditioned fear (Vouimba and
Maroun 2011). There, the response in the BLA increases after
fear conditioning and remains elevated unless subjects undergo
extinction, at which point the response becomes smaller than
the baseline response.
Bidirectional changes in synaptic strength between nodes of
the extinction circuit have also been reported before in rats that
underwent drug self-administration and extinction (Moussawi
et al. 2011). In the pathway from the mPFC to the nucleus accum-
bens core the strength of the synaptic connection reflected
whether the animal was drug-taking, extinguished, or withdrawn.
These changes in the baseline response also resulted in altered
metaplasticity (Knackstedt et al. 2010; Moussawi et al. 2011).
Finally, our observations of reduced pCREB expression in the
BLA and reduced baseline responses in the IL � BLA pathway
are also consistent with the idea of reduced excitability of neurons
within the BLA. Such reduced excitability could result in reduced
drive in the reciprocal connection from the BLA to the PL, which
contributes to drug-seeking via the projection from the PL to the
nucleus accumbens (Peters et al. 2008).
VNS has been shown to enhance cortical and subcortical
plasticity (Zuo et al. 2007; Engineer et al. 2011; Porter et al.
2012; Pen
˜a et al. 2014). Our electrophysiological data add further
evidence for that VNS can be used to promote targeted plasticity.
The mechanisms that underlie these effects are less clear.
Stimulation of ascending fibers of the cervical vagus nerve leads
to activation of the nucleus of the solitary tract, indirectly causing
the release of several neuromodulators and widespread cortical
and subcortical activation (Chase et al. 1966, Krahl and Clark
2012). In drug-naı
¨ve rats, acute VNS increases levels of norepi-
nephrine in the BLA and hippocampus (Hassert et al. 2004).
Similarly, long-term VNS upregulates serotonin levels in the
mPFC and BLA (Manta et al. 2009). VNS also induces fos expres-
sion in the amygdala, as well as the habenula, locus coeruleus,
and various cortical areas (Naritoku et al. 1995). Changes in neu-
rotransmission and gene expression indicate that VNS may be act-
ing as a primer, readying the system for plasticity in response to
specific inputs that occur during sensory stimulation (Engineer
et al. 2011), motor learning (Porter et al. 2012), or extinction
learning (Pen
˜a et al. 2013, 2014). This tight temporal control
and network-specificity that electrical stimulation of the vagus
nerve allows, reflects a major advantage of VNS over pharmaco-
logical treatments. This idea is further supported by our finding
that even brief VNS delivered contingent with nonreinforced le-
ver presses during extinction reduced drug-seeking during rein-
statement. On the other hand, even repeated long lasting VNS
given outside of a behaviorally relevant context (e.g., in the
home cage), does not induce changes in behavior or synaptic plas-
ticity (Pen
˜a et al. 2014). The targeted nature of VNS may reduce
the threshold for efficacy in current behavioral therapies where
pharmacological approaches have yielded mixed results. Recent
advances in transcutaneous VNS (Aihua et al. 2014) could further
increase the versatility of VNS in clinical settings.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
We used male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Wilmington,
MA) that were at least 60 d old (250–300 g) at the time of surgery.
Rats were individually housed and kept on a 12 h reverse light/
dark cycle, with free access to food and water until surgery,
when food was restricted to 25 g/d standard rat chow. All proto-
cols were approved by the IACUC of The University of Texas at
Dallas and were conducted in compliance with the NIH Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Jugular vein catheterization and vagus nerve electrode
implant
Rats were anesthetized with ketamine (85 mg/kg) and xylazine (5
mg/kg) and implanted with a catheter in the right external jugu-
lar vein for drug administration. Atropine (1 mg/kg) was adminis-
tered to reduce secretions, and all incision sites were pretreated
with Marcaine. Catheters consisted of silicon tubing (Silastic;
0.51 mm I.D., 0.94 mm O.D.) connected to a back-mounted can-
nula (Plastics One). During the same surgery, a custom-made cuff
electrode was placed around the left vagus nerve for the delivery of
VNS (Childs et al. 2015). Catheters were flushed daily with hepa-
rinized saline (0.2 mL of 100 IU) and gentamycin (0.2 mL of 0.1 g/
mL) to maintain catheter patency, which was assessed weekly by
infusing 1.0 mg/0.1 mL of the fast-acting anesthetic methohexital
sodium and noting the presence or absence of a brief period of
sedation.
Drug self-administration and extinction training
Five to 7 d following surgery, rats were trained in a single over-
night session to self-administer food pellets (45 mg, Bio Serv) in
an operant conditioning chamber (Med Associates). Drug self-
administration training took place in the same chamber, which
was equipped with two levers, a house light, a cue light, and a
tone. Each active lever press produced a 0.05 mL infusion of 0.5
mg/kg of cocaine (Sigma) in saline, and the presentation of drug-
paired cues (illumination of the light over the active lever and the
presentation of a 2900 Hz tone), followed by a 20 sec timeout.
Self-administration sessions ended after 2 h or at a maximum of
200 infusions. Both right and left levers were available for the
duration of the session and drug-seeking behavior was quantified
as active lever presses. Rats self-administered cocaine over at least
10 d, during which they had to achieve at least 10 infusions per
session. Rats that did not reach this criterion were excluded
from further analysis. Following the last self-administration ses-
sion rats in the drug-only group were either sacrificed immediate-
ly for immunohistochemical experiments or were used for in vivo
recordings on the following day. Subjects in the extinction groups
underwent 12 d of extinction training in which lever presses on
the previously active lever no longer produced cocaine or presen-
tation of drug-paired cues. During extinction training rats re-
ceived either sham-stimulation or VNS under one of two
conditions: in rats that received contingent VNS (cVNS), each
press of the previously drug-paired lever triggered VNS (0.8 mA
15 biphasic pulses,100 msec, at 30 Hz, 500 msec) (Rush et al.

Downloaded from 
 2000; Elliott et al. 2011). In rats that received noncontingent VNS
(ncVNS), stimulation occurred every 5 min for 30 sec at 0.4 mA for
the duration of the training session. These stimulation parameters
mimic those used for depression (Sackheim et al. 2001), and are
also similar to those used to enhance retention performance in
rats (Clark et al. 1995). An additional group of rats underwent
forced abstinence in their home cages. After 12 d of extinction
training or abstinence, drug-seeking behavior was reinstated
by presentation of the drug-associated cues in the operant con-
ditioning chambers. During the reinstatement session presses
on the “active” lever led to presentation of the previously
drug-associated tone and light, but did not result in drug delivery
or VNS. Following the reinstatement session, subjects were then
sacrificed immediately for immunohistochemistry experiments,
or were used the following day for in vivo LFP recordings.
Food self-administration and extinction training
To assess the specificity of VNS’s effects on extinction of drug-
seeking, we trained additional groups to self-administer food.
Rats were allowed to self-administer food pellets for 5 d in 2 h ses-
sions and were then extinguished with either ncVNS stimulation
or sham-stimulation for an additional 5 d. After extinction, oper-
ant responding was reinstated by presentation of the previously
food-associated cues, and the number of responses at the active le-
ver were taken as a measure of reinstatement of food-seeking
behavior.
Appetitive behavior
To ensure that the effects of VNS on extinction learning were not
due to discomfort (punishment), and to more generally assess the
impact of VNS on appetitive behavior, we also tested the effects of
VNS administered during food or drug self-administration. Rats
were allowed to self-administer cocaine for 10 d as described
above. On days 11–15, ncVNS was administered throughout the
2 h self-administration sessions. Rats working for food rewards re-
ceived a pellet in response to every active lever press without any
timeouts. To avoid a possible “cost benefit” determination mask-
ing any punishment effects, in this group VNS (500 msec, 0.8 mA)
was administered contingently with each lever press. Rats were al-
lowed to self-administer food pellets with sham-stimulation for 5
d, followed by cVNS for an additional 5 d.
Immunohistochemistry
A subset of sham-stimulated, ncVNS, Drug-only, and drug-naive
rats were sacrificed for immunohistochemical analysis of pCREB
in slices of the IL, PL, BLA, and the primary sensory cortex (S1).
S1 was included in this analysis as a negative control, because
we expected that our experimental treatments would only mini-
mally alter pCREB expression in this area. After the last treatment
session (either reinstatement or drug self-administration), rats
were anesthetized with 30% urethane (2 g/kg bodyweight) and
transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by cold 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.12 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
Brains were post-fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and 30%
sucrose and then transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS for 24 h at
4˚C. Coronal slices (40 mm) were cut on a freezing microtome
and free floating sections were incubated in primary rabbit
anti-pCREB (working dilution 1:2000; Millipore) for 24 h in PBS
and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Slices were washed three times
in PBS and incubated in secondary anti-rabbit 594 (working
dilution 1:1000; Jackson Laboratories) for 2 h at room tempera-
ture. Slices were washed, mounted, and coverslipped with
ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies).
Fluorescence images were taken at 20× magnification on a laser
scanning
confocal
microscope
(Fluoview
1000,
Olympus
Corporation). Cells expressing DAPI and pCREB were counted
by experimenters that were blind to the experimental condition.
pCREB expression is presented as a ratio of pCREB-labeled cells
over DAPI-labeled cells.
In vivo LFP recording
Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, a bipolar matrix stim-
ulation electrode (FHC) was placed in the IL (D/V: 4.6, A/P: 3.0,
M/L: 0.6 from bregma) and evoked local field potentials (eLFPs)
were recorded in the BLA (D/V: 7.3, A/P:22.76, M/L: 24.9 from
bregma) of urethane-anesthetized (1.5 g/kg IP) rats, using glass
microelectrodes (2 M KCl; 1–2 MOhms resistance), following pre-
viously published protocols (Pen
˜a et al. 2014; Childs et al. 2015).
Baseline data were collected for a minimum of 10 min before long-
term depression (LTD) was induced using low-frequency stimula-
tion (1 Hz for 15 min) at the same stimulation intensity used for
baseline recordings (23). The amplitude of the EFP was measured
as the difference between the mean of a 5 msec window before the
stimulation artifact and the mean of a 5 msec window around 20–
25 msec after the stimulation artifact, corresponding to the nega-
tive peak of the field potential. Data were normalized to a 10 min
baseline, and the period 40–50 min after plasticity induction was
used to analyze long-term changes.
Data analysis
Self-administration and extinction data were analyzed using two-
way repeated-measures ANOVA and single trial reinstatement
data were analyzed using a one way ANOVA. Analyses of VNS’ ef-
fects on ongoing behavior used repeated-measures ANOVA.
Immunohistochemical analyses used repeated measures ANOVA
and LSD post hoc testing. Changes in evoked field potential am-
plitudes following induction of synaptic plasticity were compared
using a partially repeated-measures ANOVA with a treatment
group × time interaction. Input–output curves of evoked field
potentials were analyzed using a two-way repeated measures
ANOVA and LSD post hoc testing. P values ,0.05 were considered
significant.
