ABSTRACT
The mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1 has attracted global atten-
tion, as it heralds the breach of polymyxins, one of the last-resort antibiotics for
the treatment of severe clinical infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-
negative bacteria. To date, six slightly different variants of mcr-1, and a second
mobile colistin resistance gene, mcr-2, have been reported or annotated in the
GenBank database. Here, we characterized a third mobile colistin resistance gene,
mcr-3. The gene coexisted with 18 additional resistance determinants in the 261-kb
IncHI2-type plasmid pWJ1 from porcine Escherichia coli. mcr-3 showed 45.0% and
47.0% nucleotide sequence identity to mcr-1 and mcr-2, respectively, while the de-
duced amino acid sequence of MCR-3 showed 99.8 to 100% and 75.6 to 94.8% iden-
tity to phosphoethanolamine transferases found in other Enterobacteriaceae species
and in 10 Aeromonas species, respectively. pWJ1 was mobilized to an E. coli recipi-
ent by conjugation and contained a plasmid backbone similar to those of other mcr-
1-carrying plasmids, such as pHNSHP45-2 from the original mcr-1-harboring E. coli
strain. Moreover, a truncated transposon element, TnAs2, which was characterized
only in Aeromonas salmonicida, was located upstream of mcr-3 in pWJ1. This
ΔTnAs2-mcr-3 element was also identified in a shotgun genome sequence of a por-
cine E. coli isolate from Malaysia, a human Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from Thai-
land, and a human Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate from the United
States. These results suggest the likelihood of a wide dissemination of the novel mo-
bile colistin resistance gene mcr-3 among Enterobacteriaceae and aeromonads; the
latter may act as a potential reservoir for mcr-3.
IMPORTANCE
The emergence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1
has attracted substantial attention worldwide. Here, we examined a colistin-resistant
Escherichia coli isolate that was negative for both mcr-1 and mcr-2 and discovered a
novel mobile colistin resistance gene, mcr-3. The amino acid sequence of MCR-3
aligned closely with phosphoethanolamine transferases from Enterobacteriaceae and
Aeromonas species originating from both clinical infections and environmental sam-
ples collected in 12 countries on four continents. Due to the ubiquitous profile of
aeromonads in the environment and the potential transfer of mcr-3 between Entero-
bacteriaceae and Aeromonas species, the wide spread of mcr-3 may be largely under-
estimated. As colistin has been and still is widely used in veterinary medicine and
used at increasing frequencies in human medicine, the continuous monitoring of
mobile colistin resistance determinants in colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria is
imperative for understanding and tackling the dissemination of mcr genes in both
the agricultural and health care sectors.

ince we first reported the mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1 in China in 2016 (1),
there have been reports of mcr-1 in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from animals,
animal products, humans, and the environment in over 30 countries across five
continents (2). More worrisome is the presence of mcr-1 in Enterobacteriaceae carrying
carbapenem resistance genes, such as blaNDM and blaKPC, which would seriously
compromise the treatment of infections caused by these extensively drug-resistant
pathogens (2). Meanwhile, six variants of the mcr-1 gene have been described, includ-
ing mcr-1.2 (GenBank accession no. KX236309) in KPC-3-producing Klebsiella pneu-
moniae isolated from a rectal swab of a leukemic child (3), mcr-1.3 (NG_052861) in
Escherichia coli from chickens in China, mcr-1.4 (KY041856) in E. coli from sewage in
China, mcr-1.5 (KY283125) in E. coli isolated from a human urinary tract in Argentina,
mcr-1.6 (NG_052893) in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium from a healthy human
in China, and mcr-1.7 (KY488488) in E. coli from sewage in China. These gene variants
encode phosphoethanolamine transferase enzymes but differ from MCR-1 at a single
amino acid: Gln3 to Leu in MCR-1.2, Ile37 to Val in MCR-1.3, Asp439 to Asn in MCR-1.4,
His451 to Tyr in MCR-1.5, Arg535 to His in MCR-1.6, and Ala214 to Thr in MCR-1.7.
Moreover, a novel plasmid-borne colistin resistance gene showing 77.3% nucleotide
identity and 81.0% amino acid identity to mcr-1 was also identified in porcine and
bovine colistin-resistant E. coli isolates and was named mcr-2 (4). Here, we report the
discovery of another novel mcr variant, mcr-3, which coexisted with 18 additional
resistance genes on a conjugative plasmid from E. coli of pig origin.
In a routine surveillance study of antimicrobial resistance of bacteria from farm
animals in 2015, a colistin-resistant (MIC, �4 �g/ml) isolate, WJ1, was obtained from a
fecal sample of an apparently healthy pig at a conventional farm in Shandong Province,
China. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS) analysis (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) and 16S rRNA
sequencing identified WJ1 as E. coli, and multilocus sequence typing (2) confirmed the
sequence type as 1642. Although PCR screening assays for the presence of mcr-1 and
mcr-2 were negative, the colistin resistance determinant could be transferred to E. coli
strain EC600 by conjugation, with transconjugant EC600-WJ1 also exhibiting a multi-
drug resistance profile (Table 1). A ca. 250-kb plasmid was observed in both WJ1 and
EC600-WJ1 by S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis (data not shown),
suggesting that this multiresistance plasmid, designated pWJ1, carried an unknown
colistin resistance gene.
pWJ1 was extracted from transconjugant EC600-WJ1 using a Plasmid Midi kit
(Omega, Norcross, GA) and then sent for single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing
using a PacBio RSII system (Sinobiocore, Beijing, China). Plasmid assembly was per-
formed using the hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP) and Quiver as part of
the SMRT analysis (version 2.3) using the HGAP3 protocol. Whole-cell DNA from original
strain WJ1 was extracted using a Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega,

Illumina HiSeq 2500 system (Annoroad, Beijing, China). A draft assembly of the se-
quences was obtained using CLC Genomics Workbench 9 (CLC Bio-Qiagen, Aarhus,
Denmark). Comparative analysis of the SMRT and HiSeq sequencing results revealed
that pWJ1 was an IncHI2-type plasmid, with a size of 261,119 bp. It had a similar backbone
as several mcr-1-carrying plasmids (Fig. 1A). For instance, a 222.3-kb section of pWJ1
(85.4% of the total sequence) exhibited high similarity to the corresponding region of
the 251-kb plasmid pHNSHP45-2 from E. coli strain SHP45, from which the first mcr-1
gene was identified (5). pWJ1 and pHNSHP45-2 had 12 resistance genes in common
(Fig. 1A), while pWJ1 appeared to have acquired six additional resistance genes (Fig. 1A;
Table 1), two of which conferred resistance to antimicrobials important for human
medicine, including quinolones [aac(6=)-Ib-cr] and rifampin (arr3).

 Further analysis of pWJ1 revealed a 1,626-bp putative phosphoethanolamine trans-
ferase gene, designated mcr-3, which exhibited 45.0% and 47.0% nucleotide sequence
identity to mcr-1 and mcr-2, respectively. To confirm the role of this putative polymyxin
resistance gene, an 1,896-bp DNA fragment including mcr-3 and its upstream sequence
was ligated into cloning vector pUC19, yielding pUC19-mcr-3. This recombinant vector
was further transferred to E. coli W3110 by electroporation. Compared with E. coli
W3110 containing pUC19 alone, an 8-fold increase in the MIC of colistin (from 0.5 �g/ml

 to 4 �g/ml) was observed for E. coli W3110 containing pUC19-mcr-3, suggesting that
the mcr-3 product is responsible for the polymyxin resistance. We further screened
colistin-resistant E. coli isolates collected from pig feces (n � 380) and chicken cloacae
(n � 200) in our routine surveillance study in 2015 using the primers MCR3-F (5=-TTG
GCACTGTATTTTGCATTT-3=) and MCR3-R (5=-TTAACGAAATTGGCTGGAACA-3=) and the
following cycling conditions: 30 cycles of 95°
C for 30 s, 50°
C for 30 s, and 72°
C for 45 s,
followed by 1 cycle of 72°
C for 7 min. The presumptive 542-bp PCR product of mcr-3
was sent for sequencing. We detected mcr-3 in 7 (1.8%) E. coli isolates from pigs only.
The deduced amino acid sequence of the mcr-3 gene product, MCR-3, showed
32.5% and 31.7% amino acid identity to MCR-1 and MCR-2, respectively. Similarly to
MCR-1 and MCR-2, the MCR-3 protein was predicted to have two domains using
RaptorX (Xu group, Chicago, IL) (Fig. 1C). Domain 1 (residues 1 to 172) was predicted
to contain five transmembrane �-helices (Fig. 1D), while domain 2 (residues 173 to 541)
was a predicted periplasmic domain containing the putative catalytic center. When
using the Swiss Model server for homology modeling, the best-fit structure in Protein
Data Bank for domain 2 of MCR-3 was 4KAV, which is demonstrated by phosphoetha-
nolamine transferase LptA from Neisseria meningitidis and has been previously exhib-
ited to be the best fit for both MCR-1 and MCR-2 (1, 4).
Compared with 28 other phosphoethanolamine transferases, including MCR-1 and
MCR-2, using CLC Genomics Workbench 9, MCR-3 exhibited 99.8% to 100% amino acid
identity to those found in an E. coli isolate from a pig in Malaysia, in K. pneumoniae
isolates from human pus and urine samples in Thailand, and in S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium from human stool in the United States (Fig. 2; see Table S1 in the
supplemental material). This finding indicated that the mcr-3 gene was already present
in at least three Enterobacteriaceae species in both agricultural and clinical settings in
Southeast Asia and North America. MCR-3 also showed 94.1% to 94.8% amino acid
identity to proteins found in three Aeromonas species, including one A. hydrophila
isolate from human peritoneal fluid and one A. caviae isolate from lake water in
Malaysia and one A. media isolate of unknown origin. In addition, MCR-3 aligned closely
(75.6% to 84.5% amino acid identity) with MCR-3-like sequences from eight Aeromonas
species derived from humans, fish, water, and wetland samples from 10 countries in
Asia, Europe, and North and South America (Fig. 2; Table S1). The species A. hydrophila,
A. caviae, and Aeromonas sobria were recognized as the most common Aeromonas
pathogens for humans (6). Furthermore, the 801-bp fragment located immediately
upstream of nimC/nimA-mcr-3 in pWJ1 exhibited 87% nucleotide sequence identity to
the partial sequence of transposon TnAs2, which was identified only in Aeromonas
salmonicida (7). This truncated form, ΔTnAs2, was also located upstream of mcr-3 in an
E. coli isolate from pig feces from Malaysia, a K. pneumoniae isolate from a human pus
sample in Thailand, and an S. enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate from human stool
in the United States (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that the mcr-3 gene in Entero-
bacteriaceae might have originated from Aeromonas species, and the Gram-negative
isolates carrying mcr-3 or mcr-3-like genes might already be widely disseminated in
humans, animals, and the environment.
It should be noted that when using a breakpoint of �4 �g/ml, Aeromonas species
are almost universally susceptible to colistin, except for A. jandaei and A. hydrophila. The
former species seems to be intrinsically resistant to polymyxins (8), while A. hydrophila
showed low-level resistance and exhibited induced resistance to colistin following
preinduction with low concentrations (2.5 �g/ml) of colistin (9). However, the function
of several mcr-3-like genes in different species of Aeromonas, including those isolated
from human infections (Table S1), remains unknown and needs to be further investi-
gated. Meanwhile, the possibility that these mcr-3-like genes in Aeromonas species have
functions other than colistin resistance cannot be excluded.
In summary, we report the discovery of a new mobile colistin resistance gene, mcr-3,
in E. coli of pig origin. Because of its resemblance to various other phosphoethano-
lamine transferases in Enterobacteriaceae and aeromonads identified mainly in South-
east Asia and North America in the GenBank database, this novel mobile colistin

careful review, some mistakes were found in Fig. 1A and B. These errors do not
influence the major conclusions but may cause confusion. In Fig. 1A, both IS15DI and
IS3 are intact insertion sequences; therefore, the symbol “Δ” in the original figure
indicating gene truncation was deleted from the revised version shown here. In
addition, plasmid name “PWJ1” in the key showing color gradients in the right margin
of panel A was incorrect and has been modified to “pWJ1.” In Fig. 1B, we did not show
the whole TnAs2 element (8,654 bp), so the former box around it has been changed to
a bracket and the symbol “//” has been added to indicate that only a partial sequence
of TnAs2 is presented. Finally, both the tnp and int genes downstream of the mcr-3–
dgkA segment were ignored in our previous version and have been added to both
panel A and panel B.
