Disrupted organ growth leads to disease development. Hypertrophy underlies postnatal heart
growth and is triggered after stress, but the molecular mechanisms involved in these
processes are largely unknown. Here we show that cardiac activation of p38g and p38d
increases during postnatal development and by hypertrophy-inducing stimuli. p38g/d
promote cardiac hypertrophy by phosphorylating the mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor
DEPTOR, which leads to its degradation and mTOR activation. Hearts from mice lacking one
or both kinases are below normal size, have high levels of DEPTOR, low activity of the mTOR
pathway and reduced protein synthesis. The phenotype of p38g/d � / � mice is reverted
by overactivation of mTOR with amino acids, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Deptor,
or cardiomyocyte overexpression of active p38g and p38d. Moreover, in WT mice,
heart weight is reduced by cardiac overexpression of DEPTOR. Our results demonstrate
that p38g/d control heart growth by modulating mTOR pathway through DEPTOR
phosphorylation and subsequent degradation.

ardiac growth is tightly regulated to ensure that the heart
reaches its appropriate size. Cardiomyocytes rapidly
proliferate during fetal life, but soon after birth differ-
entiated cardiomyocytes enter a postmitotic state and the ability
to proliferate is lost. Postnatal cardiac growth is therefore
mainly achieved through increases in cell size (physiological
hypertrophy)
associated
with
increased
protein
synthesis1
together with the expansion of non-myocyte populations2.
Hypertrophic
growth
is
also
the
adaptive
response
of
cardiomyocytes to stress stimuli, including cardiac pressure or
volume
overload,
cytoskeletal
abnormalities
and
intrinsic
contractility
defects.
Although
cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy
initially enhances cardiac output in stress situations, prolonged
hypertrophy, known as pathological hypertrophy, is associated
with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to
cardiovascular diseases such as diastolic and systolic heart
failure and arrhythmia3. Understanding the mechanism of
cardiac growth thus has important clinical implications. The
key unanswered questions are how cells perceive extracellular
hypertrophic stimuli and convert them into intracellular signals,
and how these signals lead to cardiac hypertrophy4.
Several studies identified mammalian TOR (mTOR) as a key
regulator of cardiac hypertrophy; for example, the mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin prevents heart-weight gain in an overload
model of hypertrophy5 and blocks cardiomyocyte size increases
induced by AngII6 and phenylephrine7, likely by inhibiting protein
synthesis7. mTOR is a conserved serine/threonine kinase with a
key
regulatory
function
in
cardiovascular
physiology
and
pathology8.
mTOR
integrates
signals
from
growth
factors,
nutrients and stresses to regulate multiple processes, including
translation, cell cycle progression, autophagy and cell survival9.
mTOR function is regulated by the formation of two multi-protein
complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2
(mTORC2). mTORC1 is composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit
and five associated proteins: Raptor, PRAS40, mLST8/GbL,
DEPTOR and Tti1/Tel2. In mTORC2, the mTOR catalytic
subunit is associated with six proteins: mLST8/GbL, DEPTOR,
Tti1/Tel2 (in common with mTORC1) and Rictor, mSin1 and
Protor10. The activities of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways
are regulated by the common inhibitory component DEPTOR11.
Stress-inducing stimuli in the heart activate several mitogen-
activated
protein
kinases
(MAPK),
which
are
known
to
participate in hypertrophy, remodelling, contractility and heart
failure12,13. MAPKs are key regulators of cell stress responses,
including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis14,15. The
MAPK family consists of the extracellular signal-regulated
protein kinases (ERK), the c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases
(JNK) and the p38 MAP kinases16. Several studies have proposed
that ERK cascade is involved in the hypertrophic response17.
The p38 MAPKs are activated in response to proinflammatory
cytokines, hormones and stress signals. Four p38 MAPK isoforms
have been identified, and can be grouped into two subsets based
on sequence homology, substrate specificity and sensitivity to
chemical inhibitors: p38a and p38b, and p38g and p38d (ref. 15).
MKK3
and
MKK6,
the
kinases
acting
upstream
of
p38
MAPKs, appear to play a role in cardiac hypertrophy18, and
susceptibility to cardiac hypertrophy is promoted by cardiac-
specific overexpression of dominant-negative p38a (ref. 19).
However, findings in mice lacking p38a in cardiomyocytes
indicate that this effect is p38a independent20, whereas heart
development requires endogenous p38b (ref. 21). Although the
p38g isoform is highly abundant in the heart22 and p38d is also
expressed in cardiomyocytes23, little is known about the role of
these isoforms in cardiac hypertrophy24.
Here, we report that p38g and the closely related kinase p38d
are activated by pathological and physiological hypertrophic
stimuli and are required for cardiac physiological and patholo-
gical hypertrophy. Using p38g/d null mice, we show that p38g
and p38d interact with and phosphorylate the inhibitory mTOR
complex component DEPTOR, inducing its degradation and thus
promoting cell growth.
Results
p38c and p38d modulate postnatal cardiac hypertrophic growth.
Stress stimuli in the heart activate several MAPKs, which have
been implicated in mechanisms of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
and survival13. p38g is abundant in heart tissue, and the closely
related isoform p38d is also well expressed23. Stress-induced
hypertrophy appears to modulate the levels of both kinases23, but
their function and activation in the heart remain unsolved.
Analysis of wild-type (WT) mice showed that expression of both
kinases increases during postnatal growth and that they become
activated, p38g activity peaking on postnatal week 2 coinciding
with the transition to hypertrophic growth25, and p38d activity
peaking on postnatal week 6 (Fig. 1a). To assess the role of p38g
and p38d in cardiac growth, we used knockout mice lacking p38g,
p38d or both kinases, confirming the deletion of these kinases in
the heart by western blot (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Ventricular
mass between postnatal weeks 4 and 11 was monitored relative to
tibia length in WT mice and mice lacking one or both of the
kinases. Ventricular mass was notably lower in p38g � / �,
p38d � / � and p38g/d � / � mice (Fig. 1b). Lower heart mass
in the knockout animals correlated with the presence of
cardiomyocytes of below-normal size, determined from cell
cross-sectional area on histological sections, suggesting a defect
in postnatal hypertrophic growth (Fig. 1c,d). Similar analysis
conducted at postnatal day 1 showed no differences between
genotypes in heart or body size (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c),
indicating that p38g/d kinases modulate hypertrophic heart
growth in the postnatal period, and not in the fetus.
Echocardiography of 9-week-old mice revealed a thinner
diastolic inter-ventricular septum (IVS) and telediastolic left
ventricular posterior wall (LVPW;d) in p38g � / �, p38d � / � and
p38g/d � / � mice than in age-matched WT mice, and this
correlated with a below-normal corrected left ventricular mass
(Fig. 1e). However, the knockout models had normal systolic
function, with no observed differences from WT in ejection
fraction or fractional shortening (Fig. 1e). Moreover, haematox-
ylin and eosin and Picrosirius red staining revealed no differences
in fibrosis or cardiac morphology (Supplementary Fig. 1d,e).

The
involvement of p38g and p38d in physiological postnatal hyper-
trophic heart growth prompted us to examine whether these
kinases are activated by angiotensin (Ang) II, a stress stimulus
that induces hypertrophy in the adult heart26,27. AngII induced
phosphorylation and activation of p38g and p38d kinases in the
heart (Fig. 2a). Osmotic minipump administration of AngII over
28 days increased systolic arterial pressure in WT and all the
three knockout models (Supplementary Fig. 2a), but only WT
mice showed above-baseline increases in LV mass and IVS
thickness (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). In WT mice,
heart mass (measured as the ventricular-weight-to-tibia-length
ratio) increased almost 2-fold after 28 days of AngII infusion,
whereas p38g/d � / �
mice showed no hypertrophic growth
(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2d). Analysis of heart sections
showed that AngII increased cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area
in WT mice by around 50%; in contrast, cardiomyocyte
cross-sectional area in AngII-treated p38g/d � / �, p38g � / �
and p38d � / � mice did not differ from that observed in saline-
treated mice (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Fig. 2e). AngII

Impaired mTOR activation in hearts of p38c or p38d null mice.
The size of mammalian cells is controlled by the mTOR
pathway28. To assess whether mTOR signalling is altered in mice
lacking p38g and p38d (Supplementary Fig. 3a), we analysed
heart protein extracts by immunoblot. We found that cardiac
activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 was impaired in p38g/d� /�,
p38g� /� and p38d� /� mice, as assessed by the phosphorylation
of the mTOR targets p70S6K, S6 and FOXO1/3a and by mTOR
autophosphorylation on Ser 2481 (Fig. 3a, Supplementary
Fig. 3b,c); in contrast, no changes were detected in the

 expression or activation of p38a (Supplementary Fig. 3d).
A major function of mTORC1 is the promotion of protein
synthesis8, an essential driver of hypertrophic cardiomyocyte
growth. Immunoblot analysis of translation initiation/elongation
factors in the hearts of p38g/d � / �
mice revealed weak
phosphorylation of EIF4E, EIF4G and EIF4B and strong
phosphorylation of EF2 (Fig. 3b), indicating that cardiac
protein synthesis is impaired in these mice. To confirm this
finding, we injected puromycin into WT and p38g/d � / �
mice
30 min
before
heart
extraction
and
measured
its
incorporation into newly synthesized proteins29. p38g/d � / �
hearts contained fewer puromycin-labelled peptides than WT
hearts, indicating a lower rate of protein synthesis (Fig. 3c). The
p38g/d pathway thus appears to support growth induction in the
heart by promoting the activation of mTOR-regulated protein
synthesis.
p38c and p38d interact with mTOR through DEPTOR.
We next investigated whether p38g/d isoforms interact with
components of the mTOR complexes. Immunoblot analysis of
immunoprecipitated p38g from mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) surprisingly detected co-immunoprecipitation of several
components of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Fig. 4a). To hone
the search for specific interactions, we focused on mTOR and
DEPTOR, components common to the mTORC1 and mTORC2
complexes. DEPTOR has an inhibitory action on the mTOR
pathway and contains a PDZ domain11, which has the potential
to interact with the C-terminal of p38g, as occurs with
other PDZ-containing proteins30,31. To test DEPTOR–p38g
interaction, we transfected HEK-293 cells with HA-tagged p38g,
Flag-tagged DEPTOR and myc-tagged mTOR, alone and in
combination.

 in contrast, p38g only co-immunoprecipitated with mTOR when
it was expressed together with DEPTOR (Fig. 4c), thus indicating
that p38g is a DEPTOR-interacting protein. To determine which
DEPTOR domain interacts with p38g, we transfected HEK-293
cells with HA-tagged p38g and Flag-tagged DEPTOR domains
(the DEP domain or PDZ domain). p38g interacted with the PDZ

 domains are sufficient for this interaction, because while p38d
interacted with whole DEPTOR, it did not bind the individual
DEP or PDZ domains (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Moreover,
HA-p38d co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous p38g, indicating
that p38g and p38d form part of the same complex (Fig. 4e).
p38c and p38d modulate DEPTOR protein levels. DEPTOR
contains several potential MAPK phosphorylation sites (S/T-P),
located outside the PDZ domain. An in vitro kinase assay showed
p38g-mediated phosphorylation of DEPTOR at four residues
(Ser145, Ser244, 265 and Ser293) and p38d-mediated phosphor-

DEPTOR levels increase in response to serum deprivation,
resulting in mTOR inhibition, whereas serum stimulation leads
to phosphorylation-dependent degradation of DEPTOR and

 Supplementary Fig. 6a), and the effect was stronger in cells
co-transfected with both kinases (Fig. 5c). Similar results were
obtained for endogenous DEPTOR in HeLa cells (Fig. 5d,
Supplementary Fig. 6b). Moreover, the DEPTOR (13xS/T-A)
mutant was not degraded, confirming that DEPTOR degradation
was phosphorylation-dependent (Supplementary Fig. 6c). We
next determined which phosphorylation sites in DEPTOR are
necessary for its degradation by generating single-point DEPTOR
mutants through the substitution of serine/threonine with alanine
in codons 145, 244, 265, 293 or 321 (Supplementary Table 2). The
protein half-life of two mutants (S293A and T321A) was
extended to the same level as that of the mutated DEPTOR
(13xS/T-A) mutant (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 6d),
whereas a more moderate half-life extension was observed
for S244A and S265A mutants (Fig. 5e and Supplementary
Fig. 6d). These data indicate that p38g- and p38d-mediated
phosphorylation of key residues targets DEPTOR for degradation.
DEPTOR is a substrate of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase33, and
DEPTOR
poly-ubiquitination
is
dependant
on
DEPTOR
phosphorylation33. Then we assayed whether phosphorylation
in vitro of DEPTOR by p38g or p38d promote ubiquitination of
DEPTOR. Our results indicate that DEPTOR presented higher
ubiquitination after in vitro phosphorylation by p38g and p38d
(Supplementary Fig. 6e). Moreover, we observed that in HEK293,
active p38g or p38d significantly enhanced poly-ubiquitination of
native DEPTOR but not the non-phosphorylatable DEPTOR
(13xS/T-A) mutant (Supplementary Figs 6f and 7a).
To determine whether p38g is involved in DEPTOR degrada-
tion after serum stimulation, we first verified the activation of the
kinase in this setting (Supplementary Fig. 7b). MEFs lacking
p38g/d had above-normal levels of DEPTOR and were resistant
to DEPTOR degradation after serum stimulation (Fig. 6a).
No changes were found in the mTOR complex components
Raptor or Sin1 (Supplementary Fig. 7c). The above-normal and
serum-independent
DEPTOR
content
in
p38g/d � / �
cells
correlated
with
impaired
mTOR
activation,
measured
by
below-normal phosphorylation of p70S6K and its target S6
(Supplementary Fig. 7c). Moreover, the serum-independent
DEPTOR content in these cells correlated with increased binding
to mTOR (Supplementary Fig. 7d). Consistent with impaired
mTOR pathway activation (Supplementary Fig. 7e), p38g/d � / �
MEFs had lower protein synthesis activity and were smaller than
WT counterparts (Fig. 6b,c).
To
confirm
whether
p38g/d
isoforms
trigger
DEPTOR
degradation through a posttranscriptional mechanism, we treated
MEFs with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX).
DEPTOR levels in WT MEFs declined after 12 h exposure to
CHX, whereas high DEPTOR levels were sustained in p38g/d null
MEFs after 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 7f). Consistent with these
results, DEPTOR levels in HeLa cells were reduced by expression
of the constitutively active p38g and p38d mutants, and this effect
was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (ref. 34; Fig. 6d).
As expected, shRNA-mediated suppression of DEPTOR in WT
cells resulted in greater mTOR activation, protein synthesis and
in consequence increased cell size (Supplementary Fig. 8a–c).
Interestingly, treatment with DEPTOR shRNA in p38g/d � / �
cells restored WT mTOR activity, protein synthesis and cell size
(Fig. 6e,f, Supplementary Fig. 8d). These results thus suggest that
p38g/d isoforms are key regulators of DEPTOR degradation by
the proteasome, thereby promoting mTOR-dependent protein
synthesis and cell growth.
p38c/d regulation of mTOR activity controls heart hypertrophy.
To determine whether p38g and p38d interact with cardiac
mTOR complexes in vivo, we immunoprecipitated p38g and p38d
from heart extracts. The immunoprecipitates contained several
mTORC1
and
mTORC2
components,
including
DEPTOR
(Fig. 7a,b Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). Moreover, p38g immuno-
precipitates contained p38d and vice versa, confirming that the
two
kinases
form
part
of
the
same
complex
in
vivo
(Supplementary Fig. 9c,d). Further analysis in heart extracts of
p38g � / � and p38d � / � mice revealed that each kinase is needed
for the interaction of the other in the mTOR complexes
(Supplementary Fig. 9c), providing a probable explanation for the
shared phenotype of p38g and p38d null mice.
The control of heart size by p38g/d-induced DEPTOR
degradation in cardiomyocytes predicts that hearts from p38g
and p38d null mice will present higher protein levels of DEPTOR,
and this was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of hearts from
9-week-old animals (Fig. 7c). Interestingly, DEPTOR mRNA
levels were below normal in p38g and p38d null hearts, indicating
that the increased DEPTOR protein expression is not owing
to higher DEPTOR transcription (Supplementary Fig. 9e).
Moreover, DEPTOR levels were strongly reduced from P1 to 2
weeks in WT hearts, a period in which the heart switches from
proliferation to hypertrophic growth. This correlated with
maximal activation of p38g and p38d, and with the activation
of mTOR (Fig. 7d). Moreover, DEPTOR phosphorylation and
ubiquitination in WT mice were increased during this period,
whereas phosphorylation and ubiquitination were reduced in
p38g and p38d null mice (Fig. 7e). In WT mice, angiotensin II,
which activates p38g and p38d (Fig. 2a), also correlated with
DEPTOR degradation and mTOR activation (Fig. 7f). These
results suggest that p38g and p38d modulate heart growth in vivo
by controlling DEPTOR degradation and in consequence mTOR
activity.
To determine whether the impaired heart growth in the
p38g/d � / � animals results from an autonomous effect on
postnatal cardiomyocyte growth, we generated mice lacking p38d
in striated muscle by crossing mice carrying loxP-flanked p38d
with MCK Cre mice (p38dMck � KO), which reach peak Cre
expression on postnatal day 10 (ref. 35). The cardiac phenotype of
mice lacking p38d specifically in striated muscle resembled that of
p38d � / � mice, suggesting that p38d-mediated control of heart
growth is cell autonomous (Fig. 7g–j and Supplementary
Fig. 10a). To further confirm that the phenotype is cardiac
specific, we treated p38g/d � / �
mice with cardiac-specific
adeno-associated
viruses
expressing
p38g/d
active
mutants
under
the
troponin
T
promoter
(AAV-TnT-p38g/dact).
Cardiac-specific expression of p38g/d-active mutant reduced
DEPTOR levels in p38g/d � / � heart to the levels of WT mice and
increased mTOR activation (Fig. 8a). In consequence, reduction
of heart growth was reverted in p38g/d � / � mice treated with
AAV-TnT-p38g/dact and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area
increased to WT levels (Fig. 8b,c).
To confirm whether p38-mediated modulation of the mTOR
pathway is responsible for normal postnatal heart growth, we
treated MCK-cre and p38dMck-KO mice with the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin from weeks 4 to 9 after birth. Rapamycin treatment
reduced the heart weight and cardiomyocyte size only in control
mice (MCK-cre), equalizing with heart weight in p38dMck-KO
mice (Fig. 8e,f). Moreover, echocardiographic studies showed that
rapamycin reduced diastolic IVS, LVPW and LV mass in MCK-
Cre mice but not p38dMck-KO mice (Fig. 8g), without between-
genotype differences in ejection fraction (Fig. 8g). Thus the small
hearts in p38dMck-KO and p38g/d KO mice appear to result from
the inhibition of mTOR activation in these mice.
To test whether decreased mTOR signalling could account for
the weak heart growth in p38g/d � / � mice, we hyperactivated
mTOR with aminoacids (aa) to restore heart growth in p38g/d
KO mice. As expected, daily aa injection activated the mTOR
pathway
in
p38g/d � / �
hearts
(Supplementary
Fig.
10b).

 Compared with saline treatment, aa supplementation significantly
increased heart size, LV mass and cardiomyocite cross-sectional
area (Supplementary Fig. 10c–f). Consistently, cardiac-specific
overexpression of DEPTOR in WT mice resulted in reduced
mTOR activation and lower heart mass, correlating with the
presence of cardiomyocytes of below-normal size, determined
from cell cross-sectional area on histological sections (Fig. 9a–d).
To confirm that decreased DEPTOR degradation in cardio-
myocytes contributes to the phenotype of p38g/d KO mice, we
used DEPTOR-targeted shRNA under the promoter of cardiac
troponin T (AAV-TnT-shDEPTOR). Cardiac-specific reduction
of DEPTOR expression in p38g/d � / � mice was confirmed by
western blot and was sufficient to restore mTOR activation
(Fig. 9e). Furthermore, these animals showed re-established
cardiac growth and increased cardiomyocyte cross-sectional
area (Fig. 9f–h). Moreover, a control, AAV-Tnt or AAV-TnT-

 reduction of heart growth observed in p38g/d � / � mice is driven
by the accumulation of DEPTOR caused by the absence of
DEPTOR phosphorylation and degradation. DEPTOR accumula-
tion inhibits mTOR pathway and consequently growth.
Discussion
In this study, we provide evidence that two stress kinases, p38g
and p38d, promote the activity of mTOR, a critical sensor of
metabolic and nutrient stresses, by targeting the mTOR inhibitory
partner DEPTOR for proteasome degradation. The finding that
DEPTOR is a physiological p38g/d substrate is, to our knowledge,
the first demonstration of DEPTOR interaction with a non-
mTOR complex protein. Moreover, our results show that p38g or
p38d are both able to phosphorylate DEPTOR and induce its
subsequent proteasomal degradation, contrary to the proposal
that DEPTOR phosphorylation was only mTOR dependent11.

 The p38g/d-mTOR signalling pathway controls protein synthesis
and cell growth, and molecular and functional evidence indicates
that this pathway plays an important physiological role in the
regulation of ventricular cardiac hypertrophy.
Our conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence:
(1) mTOR activity is below-normal in hearts and cells from mice
deficient in p38g and p38d; (2) low mTOR activation in cells
lacking p38g and p38d leads to reduced cell size and protein
synthesis;
(3)
p38g
and
p38d
co-immunoprecipitate
with
mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes; (4) p38g and p38d bind to
DEPTOR; (5) DEPTOR is phosphorylated by p38g and p38d;
(6) DEPTOR protein half-life is shortened by active p38g and
p38d mutants, but extended by knockout of p38g and p38d;
(7) DEPTOR levels are elevated in hearts lacking p38d or p38g/d;
(8) reduction of DEPTOR levels correlates with p38g and p38d
activation; (9) silencing of DEPTOR in cells lacking p38g and
p38d increases their protein content and size; (10) rapamycin
treatment in the postnatal period equalizes heart size in WT
and KO animals; (11) mTOR activation by aa injection into
p38g/d � / � mice results in heart growth; (12) cardiac-specific
overexpression of active p38g/d reduces DEPTOR levels, in-
creasing mTOR activity and cardiomyocyte growth; (13) cardiac
overexpression
of
DEPTOR
phenocopies
the
p38g/d � / �
phenotype; (14) cardiac-specific silencing DEPTOR in p38g/d� /�
mice increases their heart size and cardiomyocyte growth.
Despite the physiological and pathological importance of cell-
size regulation, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms
remains very limited. In the heart, the regulation of cell size is a
key process that modulates the organ’s response to external
stimuli.
Identifying
molecular
mechanisms
through
which
hypertrophy can be suppressed without provoking circulatory
insufficiency is a major challenge. Our data strongly indicate that
lack of p38g and p38d reduces the capacity for cardiomyocyte
growth without having functional implications: cardiac function
remained normal in these mice even in the presence of AngII-
induced hypertrophy, and they showed no increase in fibrosis
with respect to WT mice.
Surprisingly, although mTOR is necessary for embryonic
cardiovascular development and for the postnatal maintenance
of cardiac function8, inhibition of mTOR as a result of the lack of
p38g and p38d does not have a deleterious effect on heart
physiology in basal condition. This is likely because p38g and
p38d act through the mTOR modulator DEPTOR, so that the
lack of p38g and p38d results only in partial inhibition of mTOR
activity. This finding is of great interest because other models in
which the heart is incapable of growing display signs of cardiac
pathology such as cardiac dilation or heart failure36,37. The fact
that the modulation of these kinases results in reduced heart
hypertrophy without obvious secondary effects makes p38g and
p38d potential targets for therapeutic intervention. However,
it would be interesting to further study whether modulation of
these kinases could have functional implication after a stronger
challenge such as myocardial infarction.
Our findings provide definition of the previously uncharacter-
ized
role
of
p38g
and
p38d
in
cardiac
hypertrophy38,
demonstrating
that
p38g
and
p38d
are
activated
during
postnatal growth and by stress stimuli in the heart. This
activation
correlates
with
DEPTOR
phosphorylation,
ubiquitination and degradation, modulating cardiac growth in
tissue culture and animal models. Mice deficient in these kinases
presented reduced DEPTOR phosphorylation and degradation,
correlating with impaired postnatal and pathologically induced
cardiac hypertrophy.
The finding that lack of just one of these kinases produces the
defect is quite surprising because each normally compensates the
loss of the other in other biological processes. The non-
redundancy of these isoforms in the induction of cardiac
hypertrophy is likely explained by their interaction in vivo. Both
kinases cooperate in the binding to the mTOR complex and in the
modulation of its activity through the phosphorylation and
subsequent
ubiquitination
and
proteasomal
degradation
of
DEPTOR. Although p38g interacts with DEPTOR through the
PDZ domain, the exact interaction between DEPTOR and p38d
remains unclear. Moreover, our experiments with single-point
mutants indicated that both kinases are needed to induce
DEPTOR degradation. Lack of phosphorylation on S293 or
T321, residues respectively phosphorylated by p38g and p38d,
are sufficient to abolish DEPTOR degradation, indicating a
requirement for cooperation between both kinases to induce
DEPTOR degradation. Moreover, mTOR induces DEPTOR
phosphorylation on other residues, which are also necessary for
DEPTOR
ubiquitination
and
degradation11,32,33.
Additional
studies will be needed to clarify how these kinases cooperate to
phosphorylate DEPTOR and to determine whether p38 g and d
act as a heterodimer. Moreover it would be interesting to study
whether this mechanism acts in other tissues and in response to
other stimuli.
Cell autonomous control of cell hypertrophy by p38g and p38d
was validated by several independent approaches, including the
use of mice lacking p38d in myocytes, and immortalized
fibroblasts from p38g/d � / � mice. Furthermore, hearts from
p38g/d null animals are able to grow after AAV-mediated

 cardiomyocyte
overexpression
of
p38g
and
p38d,
and
AAV-mediated DEPTOR overexpression in WT hearts reduces
cardiomyocyte size. Finally, reduction of DEPTOR levels in
cardiomyocytes from p38g/d null animals increased heart growth
to the level seen in WT mice, indicating that the phenotype found
in p38g/d null animals is mediated by DEPTOR.
Our results identify p38g and p38d signalling as a key regulator
of
mTOR
activity,
promoting
protein
synthesis
and
cell
hypertrophy by phosphorylating the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR
and
inducing
its
ubiquitination
and
degradation.
p38g/d
signalling through mTOR complexes is an important mediator
of cardiac hypertrophy, and this pathway may also be important
in other physiological processes mediated by mTOR, such as
cancer and autophagy. These results reveal a new avenue in the
control of mTOR activation and open a route to the development
of new treatment strategies for disease.
Methods
Mice. Mice deficient for p38g (B6.129-Mapk12tm1) and p38d (B6.129-
Mapk13tm1) were backcrossed for 10 generations to the C57BL/6J background

 (Jackson Laboratory). To generate mice lacking p38d in striated muscle, p38d
(B6.129-Mapk13tm1) mice were crossed with the FVB-Tg(Ckmm-cre)5Khn/J line
on the C57BL/6J background (Jackson Laboratory). Genotype was confirmed by
PCR analysis of genomic DNA. For signalling studies, animals were killed by
cervical dislocation. For AngII experiments, 9-week-old male mice were treated
with AngII (1 mg kg � 1 per minute, 28 days) via subcutaneously implanted
mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet); saline was administered as a control. For
rapamycin treatment, mice were daily injected intraperitoneally with rapamycin
(LC Laboratories, R-5000) (2 mg kg � 1 per day) or vehicle (0.25% polyethylene
glycol (Sigma), 0.25% Tween-20 (Sigma) in PBS); injections started at 4 weeks
of age and continued until 9 weeks of age, when heart size was analysed by
echocardiography and mice were killed. Amino acid (aa) supplementation was
achieved by daily intraperitoneal injections, starting at the day of birth, of aa
solution at a dose of 0.1 ml g � 1 body weight, with a maximal dose of 2 ml per
day39. All aa were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The solution contained the
following aa concentrations: 6.0 g l � 1 isoleucine, 12.0 g l � 1 leucine, 7.2 g l � 1
valine, and 6.04 g l � 1 arginine (pH 7.4; Sigma). PBS (pH 7.4) was used as a control.
Four-week-old mice were intravenously injected with 1 � 1012 viral particles
encoding human p38g and p38d active mutants or wild-type human Flag-
DEPTOR under the TnT promoter. Hearts were harvested from 9-week-old mice.
Day-old mice were intravenously injected with 0.5 � 1012 viral particles encoding
wild-type human Flag-DEPTOR under the TnT promoter and hearts were
harvested for analysis of DEPTOR phosphorylarion/ubiquitination at 2 weeks of
age. To avoid DEPTOR degradation, mice were injected the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 (Shelleckchem; 0.1 mg kg � 1 per day intraperitoneally) on the 2 days before
harvesting the hearts. In the cardiac-specific DEPTOR silencing experiment,
1-day-old mice were intravenously injected with 0.5 � 1012 viral particles encoding
shDEPTOR and the cardiac phenotype was studied at 8 weeks of age. All animal
procedures conformed to EU Directive 86/609/EEC and Recommendation
2007/526/EC regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other
scientific purposes, enacted under Spanish law 1201/2005.
Histology. Tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin for 48 h, dehydrated and
embedded in paraffin. Sections (8 mm) were cut and stained with haematoxylin and
eosin (American Master Tech Scientific). Fibrosis was assessed with Picrosirius red
staining (Sigma). For wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA) immunofluorescence, 8 mm
heart sections were prepared, washed in PBS, incubated for 2 h in WGA-Alexa 488
lectin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and washed and mounted in anti-fade
reagent. Four images ( � 20) were taken from each heart, and the diameter and
areas of 100–200 cross-sectionally oriented myocytes were measured and analysed
with Image J software.
Echocardiography. Mice were anaesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and
oxygen (1.25% and 98.75%, respectively), and echocardiography was performed
with a 30-MHz transthoracic echocardiography probe. Images were obtained with
the Vevo 2100 micro-ultrasound imaging system (VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada).
Short-axis, long-axis, B-mode and two-dimensional M-mode views were obtained.
In summary, scans were conducted by two experienced researchers blinded to the
mouse genotype. Measurements of left parasternal long and short axes and
M-mode (left parasternal short axis) images were obtained at a heart rate of
500–550 b.p.m. LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), LV end-systolic diameter
(LVESD) and wall thickness were measured from M-mode tracings, and the
average of three consecutive cardiac cycles is reported. The LV fractional short-
ening percentage was calculated as ([LVEDD � LVESD]/LVEDD) � 100 MRI of
lung was performed with a 7-T Agilent scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
equipped with a DD2 console and an actively shielded gradient set (205/120 insert
of maximum 130 mT m � 1 gradient strength). For image acquisition, we used a
combination of volume coil/surface coil coil to enhance signal-to-noise ratio
formed by a 72-mm inner diameter quadrature birdcage TX coil (Rapid Biomedical
GmBH, Germany) and an actively detuning 30-mm flexible customized surface RX
coil (Neos Biotec, Pamplona, Spain). Following a tripilot gradient-echo image,
a gradient-echo sequence without gating was used to acquire oblique coronal
slices (one to two slices) and axial slices (7–10 slices covering the entire lung, 72-s
acquisition time per slice) using the following parameters: TR/TE ¼ 6.7/2.2 ms, flip
angle ¼ 10 degree, bandwidth ¼ 100 kHz, field of view ¼ 3 � 3 cm, matrix ¼ 256
� 128, slice thickness ¼ 1 mm (ref. 40). From these images, interventricular septum
and left ventricle posterior wall thicknesses and left ventricle corrected mass were
determined; the short-axis M-mode quantification was chosen as the most
representative. Function was estimated from the ejection fraction and fractional
shortening obtained from M-mode views by a blinded echocardiography expert.
For ejection fraction measurements, a long- or short-axis view of the heart was
selected to obtain an M-mode registration in a line perpendicular to the left
ventricular septum and posterior wall at the level of the mitral chordae tendinea.
Immunoblot analysis. Tissue extracts were prepared in Triton lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM
EDTA, 25 mM b-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mg ml � 1 of aprotinin and leupeptin), and
for co-immunoprecipitation experiments, lysis buffer was supplemented with 0.3%
Chaps. Extracts (20–50 mg protein) and immunoprecipitates (prepared from
2–10 mg protein) were examined by immunoblot. For the immunoprecipitation
assay, heart extracts were incubated with 4 mg of a specific antibody coupled to
protein-G-Sepharose. After incubation overnight at 4 �C with agitation, the
captured proteins were centrifuged at 10,000g, the supernatants collected, and the
beads washed four times in lysis buffer. Beads were boiled for 5 min 95 �C in 10 ml
sample buffer. Extracts and immunoprecipitates were examined by SDS–PAGE and
blotted with antibodies to the following targets: p38g and p38d (refs 41,42) at
1 mg ml � 1; vinculin and Flag (Sigma); puromycin (Millipore clone 12D10); HA

Signaling) all were used at 1:1,000. Immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare Lifesciences). Full scans of all blots and gels are
available as Supplementary Fig. 13.
Cell lines and cell culture. HeLa and HEK-293T (American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), USA) cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Sigma), glutamine (2 mM) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 mg ml � 1).
Lentivirus vector production and cell infection. Lentiviruses were produced by
transient calcium phosphate co-transfection of HEK-293T cells was done with the
pLKO mouse shRNA 1 DEPTOR (plasmid #21337 Addgene), pLKO mouse shRNA
2 DEPTOR (plasmid #21338 Addgene), together with pD8.9 and pVSV-G.
Supernatants containing the LV particles were collected 48 and 72 h after removal
of the calcium phosphate precipitate and were centrifuged at 700g at 4 �C for
10 min and filtered through 0.45-mm filter units (Corning). Once filtered, the
virus-containing medium was added (1:1 volume) to MEF culture medium.
After incubation for 24 h at 37 �C and 5% CO2, the medium was changed, and
puromycin selection (3 mg ml � 1 puromycin) was initiated 48 h after infection. The
selection medium was changed every 2 days during 1 week, and the cells were
subsequently used for experiments.
Adeno-associated virus vector production and cell infection. The AAV shuttle
and helper plasmids were transfected into HEK 293A cells by calcium-phosphate
co-precipitation. A total of 840 mg plasmid DNA (mixed in an equimolar ratio)
was used per Hyperflask (Corning) seeded with 1.2 � 108 cells the day before.
Seventy-two hours after transfection, the cells were collected by centrifugation and
the cell pellet was resuspended in TMS (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM
MgCl2) on ice before digestion with DNase I and RNaseA (0.1 mg ml � 1 each;
Roche) at 37 �C for 60 min. Clarified supernatant containing the viral particles was
obtained by iodixanol gradient centrifugation44. Gradient fractions containing
virus were concentrated using Amicon UltraCel columns (Millipore) and stored at
� 70 �C (ref. 43).
AAV plasmids were cloned and propagated in the Stbl3 E. coli strain (Life
Technologies). pRK5 FLAG human DEPTOR (plasmid #21334, Addgene), pCEFL
Flag p38g D129A, pCMV Flag p38d F324S and pGIPZ mouse shRNA DEPTOR
clone 1 (V3LMM_485571) were cloned into the pAcTnT AAV plasmid to generate
pAAV-TnT-GFP-Luc, pAAV-TnT-p38gact, pAAV-TnT-p38dact, pAAV-TnT-Flag-
DEPTOR and pAAV-TnT-shDeptor. These AAV plasmids were packaged into
AAV-9 capsids with the use of pAdDF6 helper plasmids (providing the three
adenoviral helper genes) and pAAV2/9 (providing rep and cap viral genes),
obtained from PennVector. Shuttle vectors were generated by direct cloning
(GeneScript) of synthesized NheI-SalI fragments into pAcTnT cut with the same
restriction enzymes.
The AAV shuttle and helper plasmids were transfected into HEK 293A cells by
calcium-phosphate co-precipitation. A total of 840 mg plasmid DNA (mixed in an
equimolar ratio) was used per Hyperflask (Corning) seeded with 1.2 � 108 cells the
day before. Seventy-two hours after transfection, the cells were collected by
centrifugation and the cell pellet was resuspended in TMS (50 mM Tris HCl,
150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2) on ice before digestion with DNase I and RNaseA
(0.1 mg ml � 1 each; Roche) at 37 �C for 60 min. Clarified supernatant containing
the viral particles was obtained by iodixanol gradient centrifugation44. Gradient
fractions containing virus were concentrated using Amicon UltraCel columns
(Millipore) and stored at � 70 �C.
Standard curves were constructed using known copy numbers (105–108)
of the respective plasmid (pAAV-TnT-GFP-Luc, pAAV-TnT-p38gact, pAAV-TnT-
p38dact, pAAV-TNT-Flag-DEPTOR and pAAV-TNT-shDeptor) carrying the
appropriate complementary DNA.
In vivo protein synthesis assay. For all in vivo measurements of protein
synthesis, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.040 mmol g � 1 puromycin
dissolved in 100 ml PBS. Exactly 30 min after injection, tissues were extracted and

 frozen in liquid N2 for subsequent immunoblot analysis of protein-incorporated
puromycin.
Measurement of in vitro protein synthesis by SUnSET assay. All the
experiments were performed following the protocol described in ref. 45 with some
modifications. MEFs were seeded in six-well plates with 106 cells per well in 1 ml
complete DEMEM, and treated with 1 mg ml � 1 puromycin solution (Sigma) for
10 min at 37 �C and 5% CO2 ( ¼ pulse). The cells were washed twice with
pre-warmed complete medium, resuspended in 1 ml of the same medium and
incubated for 50 min at 37 �C and 5% CO2 ( ¼ chase). The cells were washed twice
with cold PBS, and harvested. They were then washed once more by centrifugation
at 4 �C in cold PBS/0.1% BSA, and pellets were incubated in 30 ml of staining mix
(mouse IgG2 anti-puromycin antibody (12D10) diluted 1/50 in PBS/BSA) for
30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS/BSA and incubated in 30 ml of
PE-labelled anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) diluted 1/100 in PBS/BSA. The cells
were washed and resuspended in 200 ml PBS/BSA and analysed by FACS
(fluorescence-activated cell sorting).
cDNA transfection-based experiments. Cells were plated at 60% confluence in
DMEM/10%FBS 12–15 h before transfection. The cells were transfected using the
calcium phosphate method30 with the pRK5-based cDNA expression plasmids
indicated in the figures. The culture medium was replaced 12 h after transfection
with fresh complete medium, and cells were collected 48 h later. For DEPTOR
degradation experiments in HEK 293T or HELA cells, the medium was changed
after 24 h for medium lacking serum, and after a further 24 h, the cells were
incubated in medium with 10% FBS or no FBS together with 10 mM cycloheximide.
At the times indicated, the cells were collected and analysed by western blot. To
block DEPTOR degradation induced by the constitutionally active p38g/d mutants,
cells were preincubated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Shelleckchem) at a
final concentration of 10 mM.
The plasmids used in the different experiments were pRK5 myc Rat mTOR
(plasmid #1861, Addgene); pRK5 FLAG human DEPTOR (plasmid #21334,
Addgene); pRK5 FLAG human DEPTOR (13xS/T-A; plasmid #21702, Addgene);
pRK5 FLAG DEPTOR (PDZ domain; plasmid #21701, Addgene); pRK5 FLAG
DEPTOR (DEP domains; plasmid #21700, Addgene); pcDNA3-myc3-CUL1
(plasmid #19896, Addgene); pcDNA3-myc3-bTrCP (plasmid #20718, Addgene);
HA-Ubiquitin (plasmid #18712); pcDNA3 HA human p38g and pcDNA3 HA
human p38d, kindly provided by Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts
Medical School, Worcester, USA); and pCEFL Flag p38gD129A and pCMV Flag
p38dF324S, kindly provided by David Engelberg (The Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, Israel).
In vitro kinase assay. One microgram of human GST-DEPTOR protein
(H00064798, Novus Biologicals) was incubated for 30 min with 1 mg of
active recombinant p38g, p38g or p38a kinases (provided by MRC Protein
Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, Dundee, UK) in the presence of 200 mM
cold ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-containing sample buffer, and
proteins were resolved by SDS–PAGE and visualized by staining with colloidal
Coomassie Blue. The band containing GST-DEPTOR was excised and treated with
DTT to reduce disulfide bonds and with iodoacetamide to derivatize cysteine
residues. The protein was in-gel digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides
were extracted from the gel and analysed by nanoscale-microcapillary reversed
phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry46,47.
Flow cytometry cell size analysis. MEFs were trypsinized, washed and analysed
by FACS to determine cell size based on the mean forward scattered light intensity.
Blood pressure measurement. Blood pressure in mice was measured using the
noninvasive tail-cuff method48.
Statistical analysis. Differences between groups were examined for statistical
significance by two-tailed Student’s t-test, one-way or two-way analysis of variance
coupled to the Bonferroni post test.
The rest of the materials and methods are found in the Supplementary
Methods.
