Abstract
Aim—Concurrently with increasingly permissive attitudes towards marijuana use and its 
legalization, the prevalence of marijuana use has increased in recent years in the U.S. Substance 
use is generally more prevalent in men than women, although for alcohol, the gender gap is 
narrowing. However, information is lacking on whether time trends in marijuana use differ by 
gender, or whether socioeconomic status in the context of the Great Recession may affect these 
changes.
Methods—Using repeated cross-sectional data from the National Survey on Drug Use and 
Health (2002–2014), we examined changes over time in prevalence of past-year marijuana use by 
gender, and whether gender differences varied across income levels. After empirically determining 
a change point in use in 2007, we used logistic regression to test interaction terms including time, 
gender, and income level.

 Results—Prevalence of marijuana use increased for both men (+4.0%) and women (+2.7%) from 
2002 to 2014, with all of the increase occurring from 2007 to 2014. Increases were greater for 
men, leading to a widening of the gender gap over time (p < 0.001). This divergence occurred 
primarily due to increased prevalence among men in the lowest income level (+6.2%) from 2007 
to 2014.
Conclusion—Our findings are consistent with other studies documenting increased substance 
use during times of economic insecurity, especially among men. Corresponding with the Great 
Recession and lower employment rate beginning in 2007, low-income men showed the greatest 
increases in marijuana use during this period, leading to a widening of the gender gap in 
prevalence of marijuana use over time.

1. Introduction
Among individuals aged 12 and older in the U.S. in 2014, 8.4% reported past-month and 
12.5% reported past-year marijuana use (CBHSQ, 2015; SAMHSA, 2014). Attitudes about 
the risks of marijuana use are changing (Pacek et al., 2015), and prevalence of use has 
increased since 2001 (Grucza et al., 2016; Hasin et al., 2015; SAMHSA, 2003, 2014). With 
marijuana currently legalized for medical use in 28 states, and recreational use in eight of 
these, permissive attitudes towards marijuana use are becoming more prevalent, with further 
increases in use anticipated (Pew Research Center, 2014). As the social and legal 
environment surrounding marijuana use changes, a more nuanced understanding of adult 
trends in marijuana use by population subgroups is an important public health issue.
Increased marijuana use among adults could have adverse consequences, e.g., marijuana use 
disorders (Hall and Degenhardt, 2009; Hasin et al., 2015; Volkow et al., 2014), respiratory 
diseases (Hall, 2009; Tashkin et al., 2002), lower educational and career achievement 
(Fergusson and Boden, 2008; Henkel, 2011), and vehicular crashes (Hall and Degenhardt, 
2009; Li et al., 2012; Volkow et al., 2014). Potentially beneficial consequences, e.g., 
decreased opioid use and mortality (Bachhuber et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2016, 2015; Powell 
et al., 2015), and decreased traffic fatalities (Anderson et al., 2013) could also occur. Thus, 
assessing population-level change in marijuana use over time, particularly by 
sociodemographic characteristics, may help identify population subgroups most likely to 
increase marijuana use, enabling public health practitioners to plan targeted interventions for 
these changes.
While the prevalence of substance use consistently varies between men and women 
(SAMHSA, 2003, 2014), the gender gap in prevalence of use of a given substance is not 
necessarily stable over time. At the population level, gender-specific changes in use could 
translate into millions of people at increased risk for marijuana-related outcomes over time. 
Identifying trends in use by gender is therefore valuable for public health planning and 
targeting interventions. While men historically report higher prevalence of drinking than 
women, this gender gap has narrowed in recent years (Keyes et al., 2008, 2011; McHugh et 
Carliner et al.

 al., 2014; White et al., 2015), a change attributed to increasing gender equality in social 
roles, and to changes in social norms regarding acceptability of drinking by women. In 
contrast, a review found that the gender gap in cigarette smoking remained largely 
unchanged between 2004 and 2014, with a stable male to female prevalence ratio of about 
1.3:1 (Higgins et al., 2015). Studies of past-year marijuana use have also documented that 
temporal changes in prevalence vary by gender. For example, between 1984 and 2000, 
prevalence among young men decreased from 33% to 22% yet increased among young 
women from 12% to 19%, resulting in a substantial narrowing of the gender gap in 
marijuana use (Kerr et al., 2007). Other studies have suggested a slight increase in the 
gender gap in marijuana use since 2002, but did not formally test for gender differences in 
trends using the most recent annual prevalence estimates (Pacek et al., 2015). In sum, no 
current information exists specifically testing whether time trends in the prevalence of 
marijuana use differ by gender.
In addition, whether patterns in marijuana use by gender are consistent across income levels 
is unknown, which is particularly relevant during economic downturns. Unlike some 
sociodemographic characteristics, individual income can vary over time. As a potentially 
modifiable risk factor, identifying a role for income in marijuana use trends could inform 
public health policy and prevention and also provide insight into drivers of change in 
marijuana use. Studies show that socioeconomic status can modify the association between 
gender and alcohol use among adults (Arcaya et al., 2014; Vijayasiri et al., 2012) and 
between gender and marijuana use among adolescents and young adults (Hanson and Chen, 
2007; Miller and Miller, 1997; Pitel et al., 2013). Other studies report that socioeconomic 
changes, e.g., unemployment, are associated with increased use of marijuana (Arkes, 2007; 
Merline et al., 2004). Substantial changes in the U.S. economy occurred in recent years, 
beginning with the Great Recession (Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National 
Bureau of Economic Research, 2008) and increased unemployment rate (U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, 2016); and continuing with high income inequality, low labor force 
participation, and continued declines in median real earnings (Acs, 2011; Greenstone and 
Looney, 2011a, 2013; Kearney et al., 2015). These macroeconomic changes are associated 
with changes in substance use among both men and women (Arcaya et al., 2014; Bor et al., 
2013; Case and Deaton, 2015; Catalano et al., 2011; Tekin et al., 2013). However, the joint 
effect of gender and socioeconomic status on marijuana use among adults over time has not 
been examined, even though marijuana is one of the most widely used psychoactive 
substances (SAMHSA, 2014).
We therefore examined gender differences in the prevalence of marijuana use and whether 
such differences are changing over time, using data from the 2002–2014 U.S. National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) adult sample. We further assessed whether any 
differences varied by income level. First, we assessed whether national estimates of 
prevalence of past-year marijuana use were linear over time, or whether any distinct change 
point in trends occurred. Second, we tested whether time trends in marijuana use were the 
same for men and women. Third, we assessed whether gender differences in changes in 
prevalence of marijuana use over time were modified by household income level.

 2. Methods
2.1. Sample and procedures
The NSDUH provides annual cross-sectional national survey data on substance use in a 
sample of the U.S. population over age 12, living in households and non-institutional group 
quarters. Sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA), the survey uses a multistage area probability sample for all 50 states and the 
District of Columbia. Younger individuals, Blacks, and Hispanics were oversampled. 
Response rates range from 71 to 79% over the years studied (CBHSQ, 2015; SAMHSA, 
2003). The NSDUH surveys were methodologically consistent between 2002 and 2014, and 
therefore these were the years we examined.
Trained interviewers administered the survey using computer-assisted personal interviewing 
(CAPI), supplemented by audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI), in order to 
provide participants with privacy and confidentiality when responding to questions about 
illicit drug use and other sensitive behaviors (CBHSQ, 2015; SAMHSA, 2003). Participants 
gave informed consent prior to being interviewed. Additional details on data confidentiality 
maintenance are provided elsewhere (CBHSQ, 2015; SAMHSA, 2003). Our analyses 
utilized de-identified publicly available data, exempt from Institutional Review Board 
approval. Datasets from each year were concatenated, adding a variable for survey year. 
Adults (ages 18+) were included (N = 492,831). NSDUH sampling weights were used to 
adjust for non-response and oversampling, to correspond to population estimates from the 
U.S. Census Bureau.
2.2. Measures
Past-year marijuana users were defined as participants who reported most recent marijuana 
use “within the past 30 days” or“more than 30 days ago but within the past 12 months.” 
Adjusted models included these covariates: race/ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, 
non-Hispanic Other, non-Hispanic White), age (18–25, 26–34, 35+), education level (less 
than high school, high school, at least some college), household income ($0–19,999, 
$20,000–49,999, $50,000–74,999, $75,000 +), and marital status (married, previously 
married, never married).
2.3. Statistical analysis
2.3.1. Trends in use over time—To test trends in past-year marijuana use over time, the 
outcome was regressed on a variable indicating interview year (2002–2014, continuous), 
using logistic regression. The regression coefficient for the year variable indicates the slope 
(change over time) on the multiplicative (log-odds) scale. To evaluate change over time in 
prevalence of use, we back-transformed model-predicted marginal log-odds of past-year 
marijuana use to the prevalence scale (Bieler et al., 2010); the difference in the prevalence 
for the last year as compared to the first year (risk difference) indicates the change over time 
for the entire time period.
To determine if the change over time differed by gender, an interaction term between year 
and gender was included in the regression model, and an interaction contrast (IC) was

 evaluated (Rothman et al., 2008). The IC estimates a “difference in differences” or the 
difference in the prevalence differences (from the last year as compared to the first year) for 
men versus women. Wald t-tests assessed the statistical significance of the risk differences 
and ICs. Trend analyses were carried out unadjusted and adjusted for sociodemographic 
variables.
2.3.2. Piecewise regression to identify change point—We conducted piecewise 
logistic regression (Schwarz, 2015; Toms and Lesperance, 2003) to determine if the rate of 
change (slope) in the log-odds of past-year marijuana use was similar over the whole time 
period (2002–2014), or if there was a year at which the slope changed (knot). Without a 
priori justification for assigning a specific year as the knot, an iterative grid-search algorithm 
was used (Ertel and Fowlkes, 1976; Muggeo, 2003) where each year was tested as a 
potential knot, i.e. a point at which the slope from that year forward was significantly 
different from the slope for the previous years. Specifically, a separate piecewise logistic 
regression model, logit (Pr(marijuana use)) = β0 + β1*year + β2*(year − C)+, was fit for 
each potential knot year C = 2003 to 2013 where (year − C)+ takes the value 0 if the 
argument is negative (i.e. the year is earlier than C) and the value of the argument if it is 
positive. The regression coefficient β2 indicates the change in slope from the knot until 
2014. The best fitting change point was determined based on the model with the highest R-
squared value (i.e. smallest mean squared error), where a model with no change point was 
also included for comparison. Analyses were carried out unadjusted and adjusted for 
sociodemographic variables, to ensure that sociodemographics were not influencing the 
choice of the knot year.
Based on results showing that the best-fitting trend model in marijuana use in the whole 
population had a change point in 2007 (Table S2; adjusted R-squared value for 2007 = 
0.10739), regression models examining overall trends and differences by gender were 
evaluated separately for 2002–2007 and 2007–2014 (to account for potentially different 
trends) Using 2007 as the endpoint for the earlier part of the period and the start-point of the 
latter period provided continuous information across the entire time period (Fig. 1). When 
combining data over years, new sample weights were created by dividing the original weight 
by the number of datasets combined, based on SAMHSA recommendations (SAMHSA, 
2014), following procedures used previously (Pacek et al., 2015). Models were evaluated 
unadjusted, and adjusted for sociodemographic covariates including age, race/ethnicity, 
income, education, marital status, and gender (for analyses of the full sample).
2.3.3. Trends in use over time, by gender and income level—Because results 
indicated that men showed a greater increase in prevalence of marijuana use than women 
over the period 2007–2014, we used a three-way interaction term (year, gender, income) in 
the regression models to test if the gender difference in rate of change varied by income. 
These models also included all possible two-way interactions between the three variables. 
The three-way interaction contrasts estimated the change over the time period for men 
versus women for each category of income, versus the reference income category (≥
$75,000). Wald t-tests were used to assess the statistical significance of the three-way ICs.

 Sensitivity analyses also assessed whether trends were consistent by frequency of use, 
distinguishing individuals reporting daily past-year marijuana use (use 300 or more days in 
the past year) and non-daily past-year marijuana use (use less than 300 days in the past 
year). All analyses were conducted using SUDAAN 11.0.1, adjusting for the complex survey 
design of the NSDUH.
3. Results
Across all years, about half of the population was female, married, had an annual household 
income ≥$50,000, and had greater than a high school educational level. About two-thirds 
were non-Hispanic White and about one-third were younger than age 35 (Table S1). Sample 
characteristics were similar for men and women, except that more women were previously 
married while more men were never married.
3.1. Marijuana use in men and women
Prevalence of past-year marijuana use remained relatively stable between 2002 and 2007, 
followed by an increase in use between 2007 and 2014 (Fig. 1). At all time points, 
prevalence of past-year marijuana use was higher among men than women (Table 1). 
Between 2002 and 2007, prevalence of past-year marijuana use remained stable for men and 
decreased slightly, albeit significantly, for women. However, no significant gender difference 
in differences was found in adjusted models (Table 1). Between 2007 and 2014, prevalence 
of marijuana use increased among men from 13.0% to 17.4% (+4.4%) and among women 
from 7.2% to 10.0% (+2.7%), with the increase significantly greater among men, leading to 
a widening of the gender gap in marijuana use over time (p = 0.0001). This difference 
persisted when assessing the entire period from 2002 to 2014 as a whole, with marijuana use 
increasing for both men and women, but with a greater increase among men (Table 1). Tests 
for the additive interaction of gender by time indicated that the increase in prevalence of 
marijuana use was significantly greater for men than women (p = 0.0001). Fig. 2 illustrates 
the changes in prevalence estimates overall and in men and women separately for the two 
time periods, 2002–2007 and 2007–2014.
3.2. Marijuana use in men and women by income level
Considering the period 2007–2014, the prevalence of marijuana use increased significantly 
among men and women at all four income levels in both unadjusted (Table S3) and adjusted 
(Table 2) models. Among men and women in households with the two highest annual 
income levels, this increased prevalence was of similar magnitude by gender. However, in 
households with the two lowest income levels, the increased prevalence of marijuana use 
was greater among men than women (3.7% higher and 2.3% higher respectively; Table 2). 
Compared to participants with annual household incomes greater than $75,000, the gender 
gap increased by 3.1% in individuals at the lowest level of income from 2007 to 2014, a 
statistically significant three-way interaction of gender by income by time (p = 0.018). This 
is equivalent to an increased prevalence of 6.2% among men and 2.5% among women with 
annual incomes <$20,000.

 3.3. Sensitivity analyses for daily and non-daily past-year marijuana use
Overall, results for the three time periods were substantively the same as reported above 
when assessing daily marijuana users and non-daily marijuana users (Table S4). Results 
were consistent across gender and income levels, though some statistical inter-action tests 
only trended towards significance, given the smaller sample size in the stratified analyses.
4. Discussion
In successive annual surveys providing nationally representative samples of the U.S. non-
institutionalized adult population, the prevalence of marijuana use increased for both men 
and women between 2002 and 2014. In 2002, approximately 12.4 million men (13.4%) and 
7.7 million women (7.7%) used marijuana in the past year. By 2014, these numbers had 
grown to approximately 18.4 million men (16.9%) and 11.7 million women (10.1%), an 
increase of 3.5% (6 million men) and 2.4% (4 million women) respectively, for an estimated 
total of 10 million additional Americans using marijuana in 2014 compared to 2002.
We identified a change point in marijuana use trends in 2007 in the full sample, after which 
the prevalence of use sharply increased. This points to the importance of modeling non-
linear trends in changes in substance use over time to identify temporal factors associated 
with these changes. These results replicate the findings of another recent study using 
NSDUH data which also identified 2007 as a change point using different statistical methods 
(Compton et al., 2016a). The increase in marijuana use prevalence may be explained by 
several factors. One is that the national increases in marijuana use prevalence reported here 
parallel legalization of medical and recreational marijuana use across the U.S., as recent 
studies have shown that legalization is associated with increases in past-year marijuana use 
among adults (Pacula et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2014). In 2002, 19% of the U.S. population 
lived in a state with legalized medical marijuana use (ProCon.org, 2016; U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2010). This proportion remained relatively unchanged through 2007 (i.e., 20.6% of 
the population). Because several large states passed medical marijuana laws in 2008 and the 
years following, this number had more than doubled by 2014 to include 47% of the U.S. 
population. Access to medical marijuana and perceptions of normalization of use may have 
contributed to the increase in use during this time period (Martins et al., 2016). However, 
many people are not aware of the criminal status of marijuana use in the states in which they 
live, implying that changing laws may have little immediate effect on individuals’ decisions 
to use (MacCoun et al., 2009).
Other explanations for the change in trends in marijuana use may relate to similar changes in 
opioid and heroin use beginning in 2007 (Compton et al., 2016b; Meiman et al., 2015), and 
the introduction of e-cigarettes in 2007, which can be used for marijuana consumption and 
which may have altered perceptions of risk or made consumption accessible to a wider range 
of people (Budney et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016; Noel et al., 2011). The national trend data 
reported here cannot answer such questions, however they provide a basis for additional 
research to address these explanations using different study designs.
Contrary to past trends indicating a narrowing of the gender gap in marijuana use between 
1984 and 2000, driven largely by decreased use by men (Kerr et al., 2007), we found that

 prevalence of marijuana use increased for both men and women between 2007 and 2014, but 
more for men, leading to a widening of this gender gap. This confirms and provides a formal 
test of trend of observed recent increases in marijuana use reported previously (Pacek et al., 
2015). Sensitivity analyses highlight that these changes occurred among daily and non-daily 
marijuana users, paralleling findings from another recent NSDUH study showing that both 
initiation of marijuana use and daily use increased between 2002 and 2014 (Compton et al., 
2016a). Thus, the increases are not only due to more individuals trying marijuana due to 
changing laws and attitudes, but also an increase in individuals using marijuana daily, 
especially among low income men. Daily users may be at particularly high risk for 
marijuana use disorders and some may be at risk of using other drugs (Hall and Degenhardt, 
2009; Hasin et al., 2016; Stinson et al., 2006). Alternatively, increased marijuana use could 
be evidence of a substitution effect for marijuana over other drugs or alcohol (Anderson et 
al., 2013; Crost and Guerrero, 2012; Guttmannova et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016). Increased 
use does not necessarily indicate increases in problematic use or treatment seeking (Hasin et 
al., 2015; Maxwell and Mendelson, 2016). Future work should track individual changes in 
these substance use patterns over time, in relation to social and economic changes.
These results contrast the narrowing gender gap in alcohol use in recent years (Keyes et al., 
2008, 2011; McHugh et al., 2014; White et al., 2015). Our findings suggest that different 
mechanisms may operate for gendered patterns in marijuana use. While prevalence of past-
month alcohol use has been stable or decreasing among U.S. men since 2002, prevalence has 
generally been rising among women of legal drinking age (White et al., 2015). Taken 
together, more men and more women are using marijuana now than a decade ago, while only 
more women are using alcohol.
Many factors, including social norms, propensity for risk-taking, and perceived risk of 
marijuana use (Byrnes et al., 1999; Pacek et al., 2015; Ronay and Kim, 2006), may explain 
the historical gender gap in marijuana use, but they do not explain the increase in this gap 
beginning in 2007. Similarly, factors such as more permissive attitudes, increased use for 
medical reasons, fewer legal ramifications, and increased availability of marijuana (Cerdá et 
al., 2012; Grucza et al., 2016; Hasin et al., 2015; Pacek et al., 2015) may contribute to the 
overall increase in use, as also noted elsewhere (Compton et al., 2016a; Grucza et al., 2016; 
Hasin et al., 2015; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2003, 
2014). However, none of these explanations address the reasons this increase would be 
greater in men than women, and why this trend would sharply change after 2007. Without 
longitudinal data, we cannot determine with certainty which factors are responsible for these 
changes in marijuana use in U.S. men and women. However, we further investigated these 
trends by examining differences by income level over the 2002–2014 period to explore 
whether economic forces appeared to have contributed to these patterns.
Stratified analyses and tests of statistical interaction showed that the gender gap in marijuana 
use prevalence only increased in households earning less than $50,000 annually. Men at the 
lowest income levels reported the greatest increases in marijuana use (+6.2%) between 2007 
and 2014, even after controlling for sociodemographic differences in income strata. This 
corresponds with national economic trends including the beginning of the Great Recession 
(Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, 2008) 
Carliner et al.

 and rise in the unemployment rate beginning in 2007 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
2016). Because coping with stress is often considered a motive for marijuana use (Buckner 
et al., 2007; Bujarski et al., 2012; Simons et al., 2000), financial hardship and economic 
insecurity related to the weak national economy could have contributed to this increased 
prevalence nationally, particularly for low-income men (Case and Deaton, 2015; Meara and 
Skinner, 2015).
The Great Recession created the largest number of long-term unemployed since records 
have been kept in the U.S., increasing the proportion of Americans living in poverty 
(Seefeldt et al., 2012). Particularly in the predominantly male manufacturing and 
construction sectors, employment rates remain lower than they were at the start of the 
recession, contributing to the growth of wage inequality in the U.S. (Evangelist and 
Bernhardt, 2014; Schmitt and Jones, 2012). While an economic “recovery” in terms of job 
growth, median household income, and long-term unemployment began around 2012, it 
largely bypassed this segment of the population, among whom the employment rate and 
median real earnings remain low (Acs, 2011; Greenstone and Looney, 2011b, 2013; Kearney 
et al., 2015).
Qualitative studies have found that men are more likely to define their self-identity based on 
their work role (Cinamon, 2002; Ford, 2007). Men in traditional gender roles who are 
affected by labor market transformations may therefore be more likely to use drugs as a form 
of avoidant coping (Moos, 2007; Taylor and Stanton, 2007; Wills and Shiffman, 1985), 
related to lowered self-esteem, depression, and lack of opportunities (Forret et al., 2010; 
McKee-Ryan et al., 2005; Sherman, 2009). While this interpretation of the current study 
results is speculative, the consistency in findings across quantitative and qualitative 
methodologies supports continued research regarding the effects of macroeconomic changes 
on individual coping behavior and substance use patterns.
Our findings are consistent with studies documenting increased mortality among middle-
aged low socioeconomic status U.S. Whites since 1998, primarily due to external causes 
such as drug and alcohol poisoning (Case and Deaton, 2015). We add to this body of 
evidence by showing that prevalence of marijuana use may also be changing among low 
income Americans, particularly men. Reducing marijuana use could be an important clinical 
target for preventing the serious morbidity and mortality associated with excessive use of 
marijuana – alone or in combination with other harmful substances. Focused studies are 
needed to provide empirical evidence of changes in marijuana use over time for men and 
women in response to economic insecurity.
Job loss, unemployment, and poor future economic prospects are associated with changes in 
tobacco and alcohol consumption, especially among men (Arcaya et al., 2014; Bor et al., 
2013; Brainerd and Cutler, 2004; Catalano et al., 1993; Henkel, 2011; Mossakowski, 2008; 
Vijayasiri et al., 2012). Additionally, recent unemployment is associated with higher odds of 
past-month marijuana use among adults (Merline et al., 2004) and state unemployment rates 
are associated with higher adolescent marijuana use (Arkes, 2007). Our cross-sectional data 
show national trends by gender and income, rather than individual behavior change. 
However, the results for men in the lowest income level are consistent with previous findings 
Carliner et al.

 for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, both by gender and in support of hypotheses regarding 
substance use being a form of coping with the stress and disempowerment associated with 
financial hardship (Brainerd and Cutler, 2004; Henkel, 2011; McKee-Ryan et al., 2005).
4.1. Limitations
Study limitations are noted. First, the NSDUH relies on self-reported substance use, which 
may be subject to bias due to its historically illicit status and the government-sponsored 
nature of the survey (Gfroerer et al., 1997; Johnson and Fendrich, 2005). However, the 
NSDUH survey uses ACASI technology to encourage reporting of these behaviors directly 
to a computer rather than via an in-person interviewer. Self-report bias may also changeover 
time, as attitudes of the general public towards marijuana use have become more permissive 
(Grucza et al., 2016). However, the increases over time in self-reported marijuana use are 
consistent with other studies also showing increases over time in marijuana-related outcomes 
that did not rely on self-report, supporting the validity of the present findings (Hasin and 
Grant, 2016). Second, marijuana use may predict unemployment and income loss (Henkel, 
2011), invoking the possibility of reverse causation in the associations. However, this 
possibility is lessened because we report associations in the context of nationwide 
macroeconomic trends, rather than individual level changes in household income.
5. Conclusion
The prevalence of marijuana use increased for both men and women between 2002 and 2014 
in the U.S. The gender gap in marijuana use also widened between 2007 and 2014, driven 
largely by increased past-year marijuana use among low income men, relative to their female 
counterparts. This correlates with macroeconomic changes and a persistently weak 
economy, especially for individuals with low socioeconomic status. As these patterns are 
only associations, research is needed to track individual changes in marijuana use over time 
in response to personal financial fluctuations, and how this may vary between men and 
women. Our findings suggest that national economic trends may affect substance use 
patterns at the population level. Discussions about U.S. economy policy, economic 
opportunity, income inequality, and training for low income workers should consider the 
possible behavioral health effects of policy change, including prevalence of marijuana use in 
certain segments of the population. Additionally, recognizing times of economic downturn 
as particularly high risk periods for low income men can help target screening and 
prevention efforts focused on substance use in primary care settings. Identifying income as a 
risk factor in gendered patterns of substance use is an important contribution to public health 
and harm reduction approaches, given that income is a varying and modifiable risk factor 
which could be targeted.
As marijuana use becomes legal in more parts of the U.S. and attitudes towards use become 
more permissive, gendered patterns of use could change in the future. Researchers should 
continue to monitor prevalence of use at a national level and use this evidence to help 
explain changing patterns in substance use disorders, injury morbidity and mortality, and use 
of other substances. National trends in marijuana use and analyses stratified by

 sociodemographic subgroups should continue to be monitored, in order to predict future 
trends in use that may inform service provision and targeted education campaigns.

b“Change in prevalence” refers to the difference in the estimated prevalences for the end-points of the time period: prevalence in 2014 minus prevalence in 2002; prevalence in 2007 minus prevalence in 
2002; and prevalence in 2014 minus prevalence in 2007. Estimated prevalences are from adjusted logistic regression models with back-transformation to the prevalence (additive) scale. A positive difference 
indicates increase in use over time, and a negative difference indicates decrease in use over time.
cDifference in change in prevalence (over time) for men versus women, also known as an interaction contrast. A difference that is significantly different from zero indicates additive interaction, i.e., different 
changes over time in men versus women.
