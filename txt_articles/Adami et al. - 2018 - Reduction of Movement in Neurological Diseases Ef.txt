Both astronauts and patients affected by chronic movement-limiting pathologies face
impairment in muscle and/or brain performance. Increased patient survival expectations
and the expected longer stays in space by astronauts may result in prolonged motor
deprivation and consequent pathological effects. Severe movement limitation can
influence not only the motor and metabolic systems but also the nervous system,
altering neurogenesis and the interaction between motoneurons and muscle cells. Little
information is yet available about the effect of prolonged muscle disuse on neural stem
cells characteristics. Our in vitro study aims to fill this gap by focusing on the biological
and molecular properties of neural stem cells (NSCs). Our analysis shows that NSCs
derived from the SVZ of HU mice had shown a reduced proliferation capability and an
altered cell cycle. Furthermore, NSCs obtained from HU animals present an incomplete
differentiation/maturation. The overall results support the existence of a link between
reduction of exercise and muscle disuse and metabolism in the brain and thus represent
valuable new information that could clarify how circumstances such as the absence of
load and the lack of movement that occurs in people with some neurological diseases,
may affect the properties of NSCs and contribute to the negative manifestations of these
conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Several neurological diseases are associated with, or are the cause of, movement impairments;
among them, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy are examples with
analogous effects on anti-gravity muscles. Similarly, it is well known that prolonged space missions
and extended bed-rest induce functional alterations in many organs of the human body, including
modifications of skeletal neuromuscular function (Kakurin et al., 1972) due to anti-gravity muscle
reduced activity.
While the relationship between physical activity and cognitive ability has been known for
centuries, recent studies demonstrate the significant impact that voluntary physical activity
exerts on neurogenesis (van Praag et al., 1999; Adami and Bottai, 2016). Voluntary physical
activity can both produce a significant increase in the levels of proliferative progenitor cells
 Adami et al.
Movement Reduction Affects NSCs Characteristics
and restore neurogenesis artificially altered in rodent models
of muscle disuse/inactivity (Farioli-Vecchioli et al., 2014).
Voluntary physical activity has also been shown to overcome
the age-dependent depletion of hippocampal neurogenesis (van
Praag et al., 2005). In contrast, there is relatively little information
available about the effect of prolonged muscle disuse on
neurogenesis per se; previous studies describe in vivo changes
with little focus on the differentiation process (Yasuhara et al.,
2007). Thus we currently lack a detailed in vitro study of the
influence of muscle reduced activity on neural stem cells (NSCs)
characteristics.
Adult neurogenesis is restricted to few areas of the
mammalian brain: the sub-ventricular zone of the lateral
ventricles (SVZ), where it can be detected by evaluating the
proliferation capability (for instance using marker associated to
the cell cycle progression such as Ki67) (Shen et al., 2008; Liu and
Crews, 2017), the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus of the
hippocampus and the spinal cord (Bottai et al., 2003).
The synergistic action of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in the
microenvironment of neurogenic areas controls the fate of the
NSCs and is able to adjust the balance between undifferentiated
progenitor cells and newly differentiated cells (Bottai et al., 2003).
The knowledge of the determinants affecting neurogenesis
in individuals with movement restrictions is of pivotal interest
in the attempt to develop new strategies to reduce the negative
central and peripheral impact of motor deprivation in immobile
patients and in astronauts. The effects of prolonged motor
restraint on neurogenesis and the role of trophic determinants
involved in this phenomenon can be studied using a recognized
rodent model of severe motor deprivation: the so-called hindlimb
unloading (HU) mouse model (Morey et al., 1979; Desaphy
et al., 2005) which reproduces the absence of weight support
on hindlimbs. In the literature, only a few studies have shown
alterations in the levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA
and of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the
somatosensory cortex, supporting the hypothesis that disuse
regulates neurotrophic factor expression (Dupont et al., 2005).
A change has also been demonstrated in learning ability and
memory in rats subjected to anti-gravity (Sun et al., 2009). The
central effects of HU condition include a significant decrease in
hindlimb representation on the motor cortex of the rat (Langlet
et al., 2012). By contrast, physical exercise such as running
leads to cell cycle shortening in some progenitors, and the S-
phase shortening represents a major intrinsic regulator of the
proneurogenic effect in the hippocampus exerted by running
(Farioli-Vecchioli et al., 2014).
Low levels of exercise are thought to represent a major risk
factor of developing metabolic alteration (Laaksonen et al., 2002)
that could affect the central nervous system and in particular
some neurogenic areas (Bottai and Adami, 2013; Adami and
Bottai, 2016). L-lactate is a common metabolite in mammals, its
production occurs in all cells including neurons and glia, and
lactate is used actively by brain cells in culture (Medina and
Tabernero, 2005). Pyruvate is formed during glycolysis and part
of it is converted into L-lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
This prompted us to study lactate production as a marker of the
metabolic activity of NSCs.
Our studies provide a new line of experimental investigation
that can complement previous works on the role of exercise in
neurogenesis. Overall, our analysis indicates the importance of
the role of movement on NSCs properties in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Model
The experiments were performed on 4-month-old male mice
of the C57BL/6 strain. To induce a motor deprivation model
we used the HU model (Morey et al., 1979; Desaphy et al.,
2005); which is a representation of muscle non-use characterized
by muscle atrophy, and suitable for mimicking the changes
noticed during spaceflight or prolonged bed rest. Briefly, the
animals (housed at a temperature of between 20◦ and 24◦C,
humidity between 35 and 50% and with a light cycle of 12 h)
were suspended individually in cages (built by the experimenters
following the model of Wronski and Morey-Holton; Morey-
Holton and Globus, 2002) by thin string tied at one end to the tail
and connected at the other end to the top of the cage; the length
of the string was adjusted to allow the animals to move freely on
their forelimbs, while the body was inclined at 30–40◦ from the
horizontal plane such that only the forelimbs touched the bottom
of the cage. During the suspension period (14 days), the mice
were supplied with food and water ad libitum and their weight
was checked daily; the mice’s state of well-being was ascertained
throughout the period of suspension (the veterinarian visited the
mice three times during the unloading experiment, the first, the
7th and the 14th day) (see also Supplementary Materials and
Methods). On the 14th day of suspension, both groups of mice
were sacrificed.
This study was carried out in strict accordance with
the recommendations of the Ethics Committee for Animal
Experimentation at the University of Pavia. The animal
experiments were performed in conformity with the European
Law Implementation of Directive 2010/63/EU of the European
Parliament and with that of the Council on 22 September
2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes;
the Italian Ministry of Health authorized the research project
(Authorization number 727/2016-PR). All efforts were made
to minimize suffering in the animals; the sacrifice was
performed under urethane (Carbamate) anesthesia by means of
intraperitoneal injection (1.2 g/kg weight), and the mice were
killed by cervical dislocation.
Histology and Immunofluorescence Study
of the SVZ
The brains were dissected and divided coronally to the bregma
and treated as described in Bottai et al. (2014). Briefly, they were
immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4◦C for 4 h, and rinsed
three times for 5 min (min) with phosphate buffer PB; they were
then placed first in 15% sucrose-phosphate buffer saline PBS for
3 h and then in 30% sucrose-PBS overnight. Specimens were
embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT),
frozen on dry ice and cut into 10 µm-thick transverse sections
by means of a cryostat (Leica CM1510).

Movement Reduction Affects NSCs Characteristics
We performed immunofluorescence studies staining for the
epitope Ki67 (ab 92353, abcam, 1:100) the sections were rinsed
with PBS 1X for 15 min, incubated in NH4Cl 0.05 M for 30 min,
and washed three times for 5 min with PBS 1X. For antigen
retrieval samples were treated with sodium citrate 10 mM pH
6 at 95◦C for 5 min, cooled down for 1 h at room temperature
(RT), and washed three times for 5 min in PBS 1X. The tissue was
then blocked in a solution containing 2% of normal goat serum
(NGS), 1.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Triton
X100 for 90 min at RT. The slices were then incubated for 48 h
at 4◦C in a solution of 0.75% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
0.05% Triton X100 (incubation solution) containing the Ki67
antibody. After treatment with primary antibodies, sections were
washed with PBS 1X and Triton X100 0.05% three times for 5 min
and incubated for 15 min in the incubation solution. The slices
were then incubated in anti-rabbit secondary antibody Alexafluor
488-conjugated (IS20012, immunological Science, USA, 1:800)
solution at RT for 5 h, counterstained with 4′,6-Diamidine-
2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) 300 nM and mounted
using the FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem). Negative controls (no
primary antibody) were used to set up the background level for
confocal analysis.
The counting was conducted at the boundary between the
lateral ventricle and the parenchyma of the ventral part of
the SVZ within 300 µm from the ventricle where the most
proliferating cells are present over an area of 0.5 mm2. At the
bregma level, two 10 µm sections per animal were analyzed,
50 µm apart, and averaged. The number of positive cells in the
selected area was obtained as the average between the animal
group (CTR and HU) used in the experiment. The images were
acquired using the Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope and the
stacks were displayed as maximum intensity projections. On each
image, we drew an area 300 µm wide and the entire length of the
SVZ lateral wall by using Leica Confocal Software version 2.6,
with which we also calculated the surface area.
The number of positive cells in the selected area was obtained
as the average between the animals (CTR and HU) used in
the experiment. The result obtained was divided by the average
areas measured by Leica Confocal Software version 2.6. The area
studied has an enriched presence of enriched of Ki67 since most
of the proliferating cells of the sub-ventricular zone invade the
parenchyma.
Dissection of the Brain and Preparation of
NSCs
The procedure was performed as described in Daniela et al.
(2007); Bottai et al. (2008) and Givogri et al. (2008). Briefly,
the brains were removed and tissues containing the SVZ
were dissected out. Each culture was derived from a single
mouse. The dissected tissue was maintained in a PB 0,01 M
solution containing penicillin and streptomycin 100 U/ml each
(Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and glucose (0.6%) at 4◦C during the
dissection of the other samples; then an enzymatic dissociation at
37◦C was performed (Bottai et al., 2008).
Tissues
underwent
centrifugation
and
mechanical
disaggregation until single cells were obtained (Bottai et al.,
2008). Finally, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet
re-suspended in 5 ml of proliferation medium (PM) (Gritti et al.,
2002). In these conditions, in 3–5 days NSCs present in the
tissue gave rise to spheroidal structures (neurospheres) which
were harvested, mechanically dissociated and replated in PM at a
concentration of 10,000 cells/cm2.
Proliferation Assay
Growth curves were obtained from six cultures (3 CTR and 3
HU) starting from the third passage (P3). At each passage, cells
were mechanically dissociated when the neurospheres reached
the appropriate dimension (about 0.1 mm). They were then
mechanically dissociated and plated at the density of 10,000
cell/cm2 in a 25 cm2 flask. The cumulative total number of
cells for each passage was calculated multiplying the proliferation
rate (viable cell harvest number/inoculum cell number) by the
cumulative total number of cells of the previous passage (Bottai
et al., 2012). The calculation of the population doubling time
was performed using the algorithm provided by http://www.
doubling-time.com.
Differentiation Assays
Forty thousand cells were plated into a 48-multiwell plate
containing one 10 mm coated (Cultrex, Tema Ricerca, Italy)
round glass coverslip in PM medium without EGF for 2 days,
then this medium was removed and substituted by PM medium
without EGF and FGF that contained 1% of fetal calf serum.
Differentiation was reached after 7 days at 37◦C 5% CO2 (Gritti
et al., 2002; Bottai et al., 2008). On the seventh day, cells were
washed once with PBS 1X and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 10 min at RT. The primary antibodies used were: mouse
anti-β-tubulin III monoclonal antibody (1:300, Immunological
Sciences AB-10288); rabbit anti-GFAP polyclonal antibody
(1:300, Immunological Sciences AB-10635) and mouse anti-
O4 monoclonal antibody (1:300, Immunological Sciences MAB-
10259), for intracellular epitopes the cells were permeabilized
with 0.1% triton X100.
The secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorophores were
Alexa-fluor 488 (Goat-anti mouse Immunological Sciences
IS20010) and Alexa-fluor 555 (Goat anti-rabbit Immunological
Sciences IS20012) at a dilution of 1:800.
Confocal Analysis
Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP2 microscope with 405
diode, He/Ne and Ar/Kr lasers.
RNA Isolation From Proliferating
Neurospheres
In order to use 2∗106 cells for RNA preparation, 750,000 cells
were seeded in a T75 cm2 flask. When spheres were of the
appropriate dimension, a fraction of the culture was mechanically
dissociated and counted. This step made it possible to determine
the approximate number of cells per ml of medium, and the
volume of culture containing 2∗106 cells was taken from the
culture flask. The sphere containing medium was centrifuged at
100 gs for 10 min and re-suspended in 1,400 µl of sterile PBS
1X. Cells were transferred into a 1.5 mL RNase-free tube and

Movement Reduction Affects NSCs Characteristics
centrifuged at 5,000 gs for 10 min. The pellet was then dislodged
by snapping the tube and 500 µl of QIAzol Lysis reagent (Qiagen)
was added to the pellet. After the cells had been mixed for 1 min
they were kept at −80◦C until we started the preparation.
For RNA preparation samples were thawed at RT and the RNA
purification performed as indicated by the manufacturer (see also
Supplementary Materials and Methods).
cDNA Synthesis
cDNA preparation was conducted using a QIAGEN (RT2 First
Strand Kit) kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions; 2
µg of RNA were used for the reverse transcription (see also
Supplementary Materials and Methods).
Real-Time PCR
In order to study the cell-cycle-regulated genes, a Real-Time
PCR is performed using RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays (QIAGEN) in
combination with RT2 SYBR Green Mastermix (PAMM-020ZC,
QIAGEN) following the MIQE guidelines (Vandesompele et al.,
2002; Taylor et al., 2010).
RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays in 96-well plates contains prime
assays for 84 pathway focused genes and 5 housekeeping genes
(which allows normalization of the data), a genomic DNA control
(that detects non-transcribed genomic DNA contamination); 3
wells with reverse-transcription controls (important for testing
the reverse-transcription reaction) and 3 wells of positive PCR
controls with an artificial DNA sequence. The table of the genes
used in the PCR array is reported in Supplementary Table S1.
In this experiment, 7 CTR and 4 HU samples were compared
(see also Supplementary Materials and Methods).
CT values were normalized based on all plate analysis
obtaining 5 most stable genes that were used as housekeeping
genes: Cdk4 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 4), Cdkn3 (Cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor 3), E2f3 (E2F transcription factor
3), Itgb1 (Integrin beta 1 (fibronectin receptor beta)), Shc1
(Src homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein C1)
which result the 5 most stable within the plate. The algorithm
identified these genes as the most stable housekeeping genes
(Supplementary Table S2). Fold Change was obtained as
2(−��CT). The data analysis web portal also produced a scatter
plot, a volcano plot, a clustergram and a heat map.
Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry
Neurospheres from different samples (CTR and HU) at passages
3–10 were mechanically dissociated to single cells, and plated at
10,000 cells/cm2 in two 25 cm2 flasks in order to have two-time
points at 3 and 5 days of culture and kept at 37◦C and 5% of CO2.
After 3 or 5 days, cells were harvested, centrifuged and
resuspended in GM buffer; fixation was obtained by adding
ethanol to the final concentration of 70% and left overnight
(ON) at 4◦C. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS 1X
containing FBS at 5% and centrifuged at 664 g for 4 min at 4◦C.
The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended
in PBS 1X, 60 µg/ml RNase A, 25 µg/ml propidium iodide
at a final concentration of 25 µg/ml and 0.04% NP40 (for
membrane permeabilization). After incubation ON at 4◦C in the
dark, samples were acquired with a FacsVerse flow cytometer
and results were analyzed using the FACSuite software (BD
Biosciences).
Metabolism Study
MTT Assay
Cells were plated onto Cultrex (Tema Ricerca, Italy)-coated 96-
well plates at a concentration of 10,000–15,000 cells/well in 200
µl of the PM at 37◦C 5% CO2.
One day after plating and 1 h before collection, the
tetrazolium dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (5 mg/ml in PBS; Sigma) was added
to the medium (final concentration of 500 µg/ml).
Following 1 h of incubation at 37◦C, the PM was discarded
and cells were lysed by adding 50 µl of DMSO. After 15 min
at RT, MTT reduction was measured spectrophotometrically by
an ELISA reader (Sunrise Tecan) at a wavelength of 550 nm.
As background value, we carried out an MTT analysis 2 h after
plating (this time was the minimum necessary for the attachment
of the cells on the well).
Lactate Production
The analysis was performed using a L-Lactate Assay Kit II (Eton
Bioscience, San Diego, CA, US) following the manufacturer’s
instructions (see also Supplementary Materials and Methods).
The standard curve was made using a L-lactate standard provided
in the kit and the measure of the absorbance was performed at
570 nm in a microplate reader (Sunrise Tecan). The calculations
were made correcting for the background by subtracting the
value of the blank from all sample readings.
Statistical Analysis
All data were normally distributed according to the Shapiro-
Wilk normality test. All the data are expressed as mean (AV)
± Standard Error Mean (SEM). Data were evaluated by the
unpaired t-test. Results were considered statistically significant at
p< 0.05 (see also Supplementary Materials and Methods).
RESULTS
The Sub-ventricular Zone of the Motor
Deprived Animal Shows Fewer
Proliferating Cells Than in Control Animals
In order to assess the impact of the hindlimb suspension
on the number of SVZ proliferating cells, we analyzed the
SVZ of the HU and CTR animals comparing the proliferation
capability measured as an expression of Ki67 marker as shown
in Figures 1A,B.
Following the work of Yasuhara et al. (2007), in order to take
a snapshot of the changes in proliferating cells under movement
constraint, Ki67 positive cells were measured in the SVZ and in
the parenchyma of the ventral part of the SVZ within 300 µm of
the ventricle, where the most proliferating cells are present, over
an area of 0.5 mm2. For this study, more than 3 animals were
used for the groups (3 CTR and 4 HU in the first experiment and
6 CTR and 4 HU in a second experiment) and we found that the
suspended animals had 70% fewer proliferating cells than CTR

the one-tailed unpaired t-test.
The images were zoomed to discriminate the signals and all
the positive Ki67 cells residing in the area were counted. The
average results obtained were 157.7 ± 50.0 cell/mm2 for CTR
and 60.4 ± 8.30 cell/mm2 for the HU p < 0.0365. The result
(of the CTR group) is in agreement with those obtained from
other authors in mice (Azim et al., 2012), as we extrapolated the
number of cells from the heat map, and in rats (Yasuhara et al.,
2007).
Neural Stem Cells Obtained From HU Mice
Show a Lower Proliferation Capability Than
CTR Mice
We were able to isolate NSCs from both groups of 4-month
old mice: those that were suspended by the tail and the control
mice, which were free to move in their cage. Cultures from
HU animals emerged more slowly than from the CTR (the
morphology of the neurospheres was comparable) and their
ability to proliferate in the following passages (by means of
mechanical dissociation) displayed a less steep slope (Figure 2A).
The average slopes, calculated from the curves of the HU and
the CTR, were significantly different. The curves were calculated
for each sample; and a non-linear regression (using the Prism
program) was made, obtaining a slope (the starting point was
restrained to 250,000 cells). The analysis showed that the average
slope and the Standard Error Mean (SEM) were 0.33063 ±
0.0237 N = 3 (Average ± SEM) for the CTR and 0.09753
± 0.0208 N = 3 for HU. Statistical analysis was performed
using the one-tailed unpaired t-test. The values were significantly
different p < 0.0009 (Figure 2A). In addition, the doubling
time of the CTR samples (passage (P) 3–12) was 2.120 ± 0.16
days N = 3 whereas the HU samples (P3–12) had a doubling

time of 7.173 ± 1.434 days N = 3, p < 0.0089 (Figure 2B);
the analysis was performed using the one-tailed unpaired t-
test.
The observed difference in proliferation (in a similar range of
passages) was in accordance with the alteration in the cell cycle.
Indeed, cell cycle analysis, performed by the flow cytometer,
showed a significant increase in cell numbers in G0/G1 in
HU samples (Figure 3A): 68.95 ± 1.013 for HU and 57.36 ±
1.303 for CTR, p < 0.0022. Meanwhile, a mild (not significant
p < 0.1121) decrease was observed in phase S (Figure 3B) and a
significantly lower percentage in G2/M 20.68 ± 1.212 for CTR
and 13.09 ± 0.9132 for HU, p < 0.0075 (Figure 3C) (see also
Supplementary Figure S1). For these experiments we used 4
samples for CTR and HU, the experiment was repeated 3 times
and the analysis was performed using the two-tailed unpaired
t-test.
No significant differences were detected at the level of
apoptosis and senescence of the HU and CTR NSCs (see
Supplementary Data). On the other hand, the number of
cells expressing Nestin, Ki67, and GFAP was significantly
altered in HU derived NSCs (see Supplementary Figure S3 and
Supplementary results).
Neural Stem Cells Obtained From HU Mice
Show Lower Differentiation and Maturation
Capabilities Than CTR Mice
We observed that the differentiation of NSCs obtained from
suspended mice was impaired, showing a significantly lower
number of β-tubulin III positive cells than in CTR NSCs
and a co-expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
(Figures 4A–E),
suggesting
an
incomplete
differentiation
and/or maturation of the NSCs which, most likely, do not
achieve
mature
neuronal
electrical
membrane
properties.
The percentage of differentiated neurons was 6.8 ± 1.74
(average ± SEM) N = 4 in the CTR and 0.56 ± 0.2
N = 4 p < 0.0119 in the HU samples. Similarly, the HU
cultures showed a lower ability to produce oligodendrocytes
(Figures 4F–H).
The
percentage
of
the
differentiated
oligodendrocytes also dropped in this case, from 1.74 ±
0.54 N = 3 in the CTR to 0.00 ± 0.01 N = 3 p < 0.0322
in the HU samples. The statistical analysis of changes in
differentiated cells was performed using the two-tailed unpaired
t-test.
Suspended Animals Showed Alterations in
Cell Cycle Gene Expression
Two genes were found to be significantly different between CTR
and HU samples: Cdk5 regulatory subunit-associated protein
1 (Cdk5rap1) with a fold regulation of −3.53 p < 0.005624
and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6) with a fold regulation of
2.38 and p < 0.021001 Figure 5 (Supplementary Figure S2 and
Supplementary Table S3). Another gene, cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor 2A (Cdkn2a), showed a fold change regulation of more
than 2 but this difference was not significant (Supplementary
Figure S2 and Supplementary Table S3).
Other genes showed an altered expression between HU and
CTR but these differences were either lower than 2-fold or not
significant.
Statistical analysis was accomplished by means of the two-
tailed unpaired t-test.
Metabolic Alteration in
Movement-Restrained Mice
It is known that NSCs have a mainly glycolysis-based metabolism,
which shifts to oxidative metabolism during their differentiation.
In order to evaluate and compare the viability and the
metabolism of the two groups of NSCs (CTR and HU), we
performed an MTT assay and analysis of lactate levels produced
by the cultures.
For the MTT assay, in order to obtain the starting point
of metabolic activity, we first measured the relative MTT level
after cell adhesion on the wells (previously coated with Cultrex,
Tema Ricerca, Italy). After 1 or 3 days, the experiment was
performed and the measurements obtained were subtracted from
the background (measured in a well with no cells) and scaled as
a function of the baseline obtained at day 0. The cell viability of
the HU cells (expressed as arbitrary units) was significantly lower
than that of the CTR (the former 40% of the latter), (p < 0.0364)
at one day of culture (Figure 6A) and 52% (p < 0.0017) at 3 days
of culture (Figure 6B). The experiments were performed three
times using at least 5 samples for the CTR and 4 samples for HU.
MTT assay statistical analysis was performed using the two-
tailed unpaired t-test.
Our results confirmed the lower metabolic capability of the
HU samples; indeed after 4 h of culturing HU samples showed
61.2% less lactate than CTR samples (p < 0.0142) (Figure 6C)
whereas after 18 h of culturing the HU samples level was 46.1%
of that of the CTR, p < 0.0275 (Figure 6D). Statistical analysis
was accomplished by means of the two-tailed unpaired t-test.
DISCUSSION
A severe reduction of movement is present in many different
pathologies such as spinal cord injury, spinal muscle atrophy,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, and can
be due to impairment of the skeleton muscular apparatus or
of the central and peripheral nervous system. This condition
is also common in bedrest patients (due to a wide range of
pathologies) or in astronauts who experience low gravity for
prolonged periods. Reduction of movement or gravity stimuli
exerts an important effect on the human body, altering the
activity of many organs including the brain. To study these
effects, we took advantage of the hindlimb unloading protocol
(Morey et al., 1979; Desaphy et al., 2005), which reproduces the
reduction of movements or the absence of gravity in space.
Our previous experience with HU mice, which were used
for the present and other studies (Brocca et al., 2010; Desaphy
et al., 2010; Maffei et al., 2014; Cannavino et al., 2015), indicates
that HU can produced significant stress in about 6% of cases
and during the first 3 days of suspension (Kawano et al., 1994;
Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002; Basco et al., 2010; Gaignier

et al., 2014; Mysoet et al., 2014), after which the levels of
stress, serum, and urine corticosterone measured, returned to
the normal ones of the non-suspended animals. Indeed, it had
already been demonstrated (Kawano et al., 1994) that in 5-
week-old rats corticosterone urinary excretion in the control
group was 87.4 ± 12.8 ng/day and did not change throughout
the unloading time. A significant increase (more than 3-fold)
in corticosterone excretion was found on days 1 and 3 during
the suspension before returning to control levels, this time is
little longer in older rats (Kawano et al., 1994). Meanwhile, the
number of proliferating cells in rat neurogenic areas was not
affected by adrenalectomy, the treatment of these animals with
corticosteroids induced a significant increase in the hippocampus
but not in the SVZ (Alonso, 2000). Other authors (Lee et al.,
2016) demonstrated that chronic injection of corticosterone, for
28 days, can significantly reduce the cell proliferation and the
differentiation in the SVZ. However, this treatment mimics a
very long stress condition that is not analogous to our model.
Indeed, even after 21 days, HU mice did not show any significant
difference in corticosterone plasma level respect to control mice
(Gaignier et al., 2014).
The thymus and the spleen weight (normalized by body
weight) and the number of nucleated cells of the spleen were
demonstrated not statistically different between CRT and HU
(Gaignier et al., 2014). In our experience, we found no difference
in the weight of the adrenal gland (normalized by body weight)
between suspended and CTR mice (Bottai, Recchia, and Canepari
unpublished results).
All these data indicate that the suspended animals, which can
freely explore the cage without climbing, underwent little stress
and most likely the changes in NSCs characteristics are due to
the reduced overall amount of movements, by selective disuse
of the hindlimb muscles. Although HU mice back limbs are free
to make voluntary movements through the full range of motion,
limb muscles are not exposed to the weight load and are lacking
an active muscle force and strength development.

analyzes the normalized expression of all genes on the array between the two
groups (CTR and HU) by plotting them against one another and indicating
large gene expression alterations. The central line indicates unchanged gene
expression whereas the dotted lines show the selected fold regulation

sections exceed the selected fold regulation threshold. The two genes that
were observed to be significantly different between CTR and HU are indicated
by arrows. (Controls = CTR, n = 7, and Hindlimb Unloading = HU, n = 4).
Many hypotheses can be drawn to explain the role of HU
on NSCs properties. The reduction of movement of hindlimbs
could induce an alteration in afferent signaling and feedback
information from intramuscular receptors, to the cerebral cortex,
due to a modification of the reflex organization in hindlimb
muscle groups (D’Amelio et al., 1998). Similarly, a prolonged
unilateral lower limb suspension, in humans, induces a variation
of the nervous system plastic properties (Clark et al., 2006).
On the site of neurotransmitters, it was demonstrated that 28
days of HU exposure in rats induced changes in the memory
function and spatial learning that were related to protein
expression changes (75 proteins were over-expressed and 72
down-regulated; Wang et al., 2017). In particular, the expression
of Glutamate receptor (GluR) 1, GluR4, and the level of glutamate
were up-regulated (Wang et al., 2017). On the other hand, the
concentration of serotonin, dopamine, GABA, and epinephrine
was reduced respect to control rats (Wang et al., 2017). Others
studies indicated that HU-induced mRNA levels alterations of
trophic factors such as NGF and BDNF in the somatosensory
cortex (Dupont et al., 2005). In addition, many factors, such
as cytokine and peptides, but also metabolites, exosomes, and
miRNA, are released in the circulating system by the muscle
during its activity allowing the possibility to influence other
tissue (i.e., bone, liver, adipose tissue, cardiovascular system,
brain) with autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine effects (Pedersen,
2011; Giudice and Taylor, 2017; Pourteymour et al., 2017; Safdar
and Tarnopolsky, 2018; Whitham et al., 2018). Finally, other

authors have previously demonstrated that the inhibition of
bone formation, induced by unloading, is a consequence of
the hindlimb elevation independently of the glucocorticoids
since plasma corticosterone levels are not significantly different
between normally loaded and unloaded rats and adrenalectomy
had no protective effect on bone loss in unloaded animals
(Halloran et al., 1988).
In our previous experience, where mice refused to eat during
the first 2 days of suspension they were unfastened on the second
day and discarded from the study. In the current study, none of
the animals were discarded. Our previous observations indicated
that the body weight of the animals that undergo suspension have
a slight but significant decrease in their body mass (Desaphy et al.,
2010), whereas other researchers even with prolonged suspension
did not find differences compared to control group (Colaianni
et al., 2017).
During the unloading experiment, mice were monitored
daily for appropriate food and water intake, urination and
defecation and normal grooming behavior, which were observed
to be statistically similar between the two groups, indicating
that they experienced very little stress. The weights of the
antigravity muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) were decreased
significantly (respectively by 10 and 20%) after unloading, as
already demonstrated in previous work of our group (Brocca
et al., 2010) and from other groups (Hanson et al., 2013).
Our study adds more information for a better understanding
of the role of movement reduction in NSCs features. It is known
that physical inactivity is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease
Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

 Adami et al.
Movement Reduction Affects NSCs Characteristics
(AD) (Hashimoto et al., 2017) since hippocampal atrophy was
associated with the AD. In a recent meta-analysis, Guure and
collaborators found that physical activity is more protective
against AD than all the other forms of dementia (Guure et al.,
2017).
Physical activity induces an increase in the hippocampal
volume and ameliorates the neurogenesis (Bednarczyk et al.,
2009) most likely via the augmentation of the blood flow
(Cass, 2017). Consistently with this, the level of VEGF in the
plasma of suspended rats decreases after 14 days of treatment,
whereas it remains unaltered in the brain (Yasuhara et al.,
2007) and in the soleus muscle (Wagatsuma, 2008). Long
suspension (4 weeks) induced an inflammatory response in the
common carotid artery of rats exposed to simulated microgravity,
indicating that the inflammatory response may be a cellular
mechanism that is responsible for the arterial remodeling during
exposure to simulated microgravity (Liu et al., 2014). Prospective
studies indicate that physical inactivity is one of the most
frequent avoidable risk factors for developing AD. Moreover,
elevated physical activity levels are associated with a lower
risk of AD. The AD patient who undertook exercise training
showed decreased neuropsychiatric symptoms, improvement in
cognitive function, and a slower decline in the activities of
daily life (Cass, 2017). After exercise AD patients regained some
of their brain capabilities following appropriate and controlled
physical training (Okonkwo et al., 2014).
We decided to study SVZ because its role in neurogenesis
in the adult human might—albeit not comparable, in term of
activity, with rodents—have a major impact on human brain
health. It is already known that neuroblasts derived from SVZ
migrate through the rostral migratory stream system into the
olfactory bulb (Sanai et al., 2004; van den Berge et al., 2010).
However, there is another major migratory pathway of immature
neurons destined for the prefrontal cortex in infants (Sanai
et al., 2011) and it was found, by measuring the levels of
nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA (Bergmann
et al., 2012), that there is insignificant neurogenesis in the
human olfactory bulb. Surprisingly it was determined that
there is a postnatal cell turnover in the striatum of adult
humans (Ernst et al., 2014) that the authors suggested derives
from the SVZ. Despite this evidence, there are limited hints
about the role of exercise on neurogenesis in SVZ which
impact remains debated (Brown et al., 2003; Bednarczyk et al.,
2009; Blackmore et al., 2012; Chae et al., 2014). On the
contrary, the positive role of exercise, especially in the case
of previous brain impairment, is well assured (Lee et al.,
2016; Mastrorilli et al., 2017). Finally, the impact on the
hippocampus is more extensive and established (Lee et al.,
2016; Mastrorilli et al., 2017; Snyder et al., 2017; Bouchard-
Cannon et al., 2018; Firth et al., 2018; Masrour et al.,
2018).
This range of evidence prompted us to carry out an ex
vivo analysis demonstrating that, as already showed in the rat
hippocampus model (Yasuhara et al., 2007), hindlimb unloading
exerts a reduction in proliferating Ki67 (an endogenous marker
of cell proliferation, expressed in the nucleus in all phases of
the cell cycle except the resting phase, that is associated with,
and necessary for, cellular proliferation) positive cells in the SVZ
(Figure 1).
This first step allowed us to predict some alteration in
NSCs attributes of the SVZ of the suspended animals; we then
proceeded with the preparation of NSC cultures from this region.
We were able to produce NSC cultures from the SVZ of the
HU and CTR mice; we found that HU NSCs neurospheres were
more difficult to obtain since they emerged more slowly than
those from the controls. The morphology of the neurospheres of
the two culture groups was similar, with no difference in shape
or adhesion to the plastic of the flask. However, we noticed
before doing any counting that the size of the neurospheres
was clearly smaller in the HU group. The proliferation analysis
was performed measuring the cell number in the exponentially
growing phase for many passages. This procedure showed that
the proliferation capability of the HU derived SVZ NSCs was
impaired, confirming the result obtained in ex vivo analysis
(Figure 2). We analyzed the expression level of epitopes routinely
detected in NSCs such as Nestin, GFAP, SOX2 (Kuhn et al.,
2016), GLAST (Gubert et al., 2009), and Ki67, that is expressed
in proliferating cells in all active phases of the cell cycle.
The number of cells expressing Nestin, Ki67, and GFAP was
significantly reduced in HU derived NSCs. The diminished
number of Ki67 positive cells supports our results on NSCs
proliferation (Figure 2). A decrease in Nestin and GFAP positive
cells (Supplementary Figure S3) could be related to fewer
committed glial cells that led to less glial differentiation as also
shown in Figure 4. On the contrary, Sox2, that is considered a
more trustworthy stem cell marker (Sarkar and Hochedlinger,
2013), did not show any changes in its expression. This result
can be explained considering that we evaluated the number of
positive cells, which is correlated with the change in cell cycle
kinetics that we observed (Figure 3), rather than a decrease in
the level of expression of these markers per cell. Further analysis
will be necessary in order to understand these aspects.
The suspension induced an arrest of NSCs in the G0/G1 phase
and a significant reduction in the G2/M phase (Figure 3), the
G0/G1 arrest was also found in of rat bMSCs when exposed to
simulated or real microgravity (Bradamante et al., 2014).
The effect of hindlimb unloading on the stereological
parameters of the hippocampus and the motor cortex in male rats
was recently assessed (see Supplementary discussion a).
Another interesting aspect is the potential reversibility of the
alterations induced by adult NSCs in the SVZ, following a more
or less long period of post-HU recovery. The recovery (after
suspension) with or without exercise in rats were ineffective for
the retrieval of proliferation and differentiation in SVZ (Yasuhara
et al., 2007).
With regard to the metabolic capacity of the HU and CTR
NSCs, it is recognized that intracellular pO2 values of 0.5
Torr or less occur in O2-limited oxidative phosphorylation
and consequent lactate production and accumulation (Rogatzki
et al., 2015). At low levels of oxygen, energy is provided
by anaerobic metabolism, leading to the production of lactic
acid (De Filippis and Delia, 2011). Stem cells, such as
ESCs, HSCs, MSCs, and others, have immature mitochondrial
morphology, a reduced oxidative capacity and enhanced anabolic

levels in the glycolytic pathways (Folmes et al., 2012). Brain
lactate is a major substrate for oxidative metabolism during
development and it is selectively utilized as an anabolic
reservoir for cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore,
lactate is used actively by brain cells in culture (Medina
and Tabernero, 2005). In this scenario, the results obtained
from our work emphasize the involvement of metabolism
alteration and NSCs properties during the reduction of motor
activity.
The MTT assay has been widely used to assess cell viability;
however, MTT effectively measures the metabolic activity of
live cells, since it evaluates the capacity of cells to reduce
the tetrazolium dye by functioning mitochondria. The levels
of oxygen have been shown to affect NSCs characteristics
during normal development, disease and culturing (Studer
et al., 2000; Mohyeldin et al., 2010; Santilli et al., 2010).
Since the NSCs have mostly a glycolytic metabolism, due to
the low oxygen tension level (Zhang et al., 2015) the lower
lactate level measured in HU NSCs indicates that these cells
have a higher oxidative metabolism (Figure 6C,D), this was
also demonstrated by other authors (Medina and Tabernero,
2005).
Contrary to what was expected, a gene, Cdk5 regulatory
subunit-associated protein 1 (CDKrap1), was significantly
reduced in HU samples relative to CTR (Figure 5). Cdk5rap1
was first found to be a negative Cdk5 regulator but in a
subsequent study, Cdk5rap1 was found to be responsible
for the post-synthetic conversion of the RNA modification
N6-isopentenyladenosine
(i6
A)
into
2-methylthio-N6-
isopentenyladenosine (ms2 i6 A). (Cdk5rap1) is responsible
for 2-methylthio modifications of mammalian mitochondria
(mt)-tRNAs for Ser(UCN), Phe, Tyr, and Trp codons (Wang
et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2015). In breast cancer cells MCF-
7 Cdk5rap1 paucity induces cell cycle arrest (Wang et al.,
2015). The Cdk5rap1-KO mice are sensitive to stress-induced
mitochondrial remodeling (see Supplementary discussion b).
Another gene which expression was altered in HU NSCs,
compared to CTR NSCs is Cdk6.
On the basis of our findings, we can speculate that the low
expression level of Cdk6 in NSCs from CTR animals correlates
with their higher proliferation capacity, so the elevated level of
expression of this gene in HU derived NSC should be implicated
in their altered capabilities (Figure 5). Cdk6, acting as cell
cycle kinase, promotes the progression to S phase, chromatin
status, cell death, cell survival, and DNA repair interacting with
cyclin D; moreover, behaving as transcriptional regulators, Cdk6
interacts with other proteins such as RUNX1, NF-kB, STAT3,
and AP-1 regulating respectively differentiation, inflammation,
cell cycle arrest, stress hematopoiesis and angiogenesis (Tigan
et al., 2016). Cdk6 and cyclin D are very important drivers
of tumorigenesis. Cdk6 can have a role as tumor suppressor
reducing proliferation in lymphoid malignancies (Kollmann
et al., 2013), or restrain the proliferation of breast cancer cells
(Lucas et al., 2004). Further analysis will be necessary to depict
this aspect.
These data, to our knowledge, are the first evidence of a
correlation between changes in NSCs attributes after movement
restraint,
metabolism
modification,
and
gene
expression
changes. Interesting, the ability of HU cells to maintain
their altered properties for more than 10 passages of culture
suggests that an epigenetic modification might be involved.
In these regards, the fact that suspended animals underwent
a stress during the first three days of the unloading period
could explain the gene expression alteration in terms of
epigenetic changes. However, the gene expression analysis
we performed on the cell cycle genes showed no changes in
genes that are usually affected during stress induction namely
Cyclin D1 and Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (P21)
(Juszczak and Stankiewicz, 2018) but rather other genes were
altered.
Epigenetic modifications affect not only DNA and proteins,
but also coding and non-coding RNAs. RNAs can be modified in
more than 100 ways including N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N7-
methylguanosine (m7G), m5C, pseudouridine, and queuosine
(Jia et al., 2013). Many such modifications have a basic function
in controlling aspects of RNA metabolism, such as splicing,
transport, translation, and degradation. These active RNA
modifications represent another level of gene regulation, termed
“epitranscriptomics.” The discovery that Cdk5rap1 (which acts
as methylthiotransferase in mitochondria RNA) was altered in
its expression after motor deprivation is very intriguing in this
context, and opens a new link between neurogenesis metabolism
and cell regulation.
