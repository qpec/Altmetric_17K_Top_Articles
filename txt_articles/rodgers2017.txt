Abstract
The appearance pressures experienced by fashion models have been criticized as harmful to their
health, as well as increasing eating disorder risk among youth by promoting ideals of extreme thin-
ness. Given recent legislation to protect models, we undertook a strategic science study to assess
professional fashion models’ perceptions of the potential impact and feasibility of seven policy
proposals. A sample of 85 female fashion models, mean age5 22.7 years (SD 3.7) completed an
online survey assessing unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCB), perceived pressure from
agencies to lose weight, as well as the perceived impact and feasibility of seven potential policy
actions. Chi-squared analyses and multivariable logistic regressions compared UWCB among mod-
els who were asked to lose weight and those who were not. Friedman and Kendall’s W tests were
conducted to examine differences in impact and feasibility ratings across the seven policy pro-
posals. Models reported high levels of pressure to lose weight, which was associated with higher
odds of engaging in UWCB. The policy approaches rated as most impactful were those to increase
worker protections, though they were rated as only moderately feasible. Requiring employers to
provide food and a 30-min break for jobs longer than 6 h was rated as both impactful and feasible.
Imposing restrictions on minimum BMI was rated as the least impactful. Approaches providing
employment protections and healthier working conditions are most supported by professional
models. These findings help to illuminate viable policy approaches from the perspective of key
stakeholders.

| INTRODUCTION
Although the etiology of eating disorders is multifactorial, the promo-
tion of unrealistic standards of beauty and thinness from the sociocul-
tural context has been highlighted as one of the most prominent
contributing factors (Levine & Murnen, 2009; Rodgers & Meliolim,
2016; Rodgers, Paxton, & McLean, 2014). As a result, implementing
policies that aim to limit the amount of thin-ideal content in the media
environment and promote a greater diversity of portrayed body shapes
has been proposed as a helpful strategy from a standpoint of universal
prevention (Austin, 2012; Neumark-Sztainer, 2016). The successful
development and implementation of such policies, however, requires
not only the generation of data that are capable of supporting and
influencing policy changes, but also policy strategies that are accepta-
ble to end users (Gauvin & Steiger, 2012; Mello, Studdert, & Brennan,
2006; Paxton, 2015). Thus, these efforts can benefit from strategic sci-
ence, which requires researchers “to identify agents of change and cre-
ate reciprocal information flow between researchers and these actors,”
who may be policymakers, end users, or other stakeholders with an
interest in a proposed policy (Brownell & Roberto, 2015). The fashion
industry plays a central role in creating and marketing of representa-
tions of beauty (Entwistle & Wissinger, 2006; Mears, 2010) and fashion
models are important stakeholders in efforts to enhance regulation of
the industry. Our aim was to present findings from a study examining
the acceptability of legislative proposals related to the work of fashion
models as an example of such strategic research, in the hopes of
encouraging and informing future strategic science in the area of eating
disorders prevention.

 Among the key players in the fashion industry are the professional
models, who embody the representations sold by the industry. How-
ever, importantly, analyses of the fashion industry have described fash-
ion models as occupying a precarious and power-deprived position due
to the changing esthetic norms, a predominance of young, female, and
often immigrant models, and the high turnover rate of models in an
industry that values newness and extreme youth (Johnson, 2011;
Mears, 2008). In particular, modeling agencies have been reported to
hold a large amount of power over the employment of fashion models
and the development of their careers (Johnson, 2011). Relatedly, pro-
fessional fashion models have been described as experiencing high lev-
els of pressure to achieve and maintain an extremely thin appearance
and commodify and adapt their bodies to increase their marketability
(Brenner & Cunningham, 1992; Entwistle & Wissinger, 2006; Mears,
2008; Preti, Usai, Miotto, Petretto, & Masala, 2008; Treasure, Wack, &
Roberts, 2008). However, to date, data on fashion models’ self-
reported perceived pressure to maintain an extremely slender figure
are lacking.
While still scarce, some data do exist regarding the prevalence of
unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCB) and disordered eating
among fashion models, with up to 18% of professional models report-
ing restriction (Preti et al., 2008), 31% reporting nonpurging behavior
including fasting in the past month (Santonastaso, Mondini, & Favaro,
2002), and up to 60% reporting bulimic episodes in the previous 3
months as compared to 34% of control participants (Preti et al., 2008).
However, findings regarding the potential higher prevalence of eating
disorders among professional models have been mixed. Extant data
suggest that full-syndrome eating disorders may not be more prevalent
in this group as compared to the general population, however, compari-
sons of the rates of partial syndromes suggest that these may be more
elevated among models (Zancu & Enea, in press), thus increasing their
risk of developing partial syndrome eating disorders. Importantly, how-
ever, previous studies have mainly examined eating disordered atti-
tudes and behaviors as composite constructs using validated measures
(Zancu & Enea, in press), and the prevalence of disordered eating and
UWCB is not well documented.
Considering the reach of fashion images and their detrimental
effects on consumers through the portrayal of unrealistic body shapes,
as well as the rates of disordered eating and weight control behaviors
among professional fashion models, and generally poor work conditions
(Arvidsson, Malossi & Naro, 2010; Zancu & Enea, in press), a number
of legislative efforts have emerged in several countries in recent years
aiming to protect models from these pressures encouraging extreme
thinness (Record & Austin, 2015). Given the prominence of the U.S.
fashion industry, with nearly 6,000 working models (U.S. Department
of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015), similar policy action in the
United States may be expected to have high impact on the industry.
State policy action has begun with a law passed in New York in 2013
protecting child models and a recent bill filed, although not passed, in
the California State Assembly (Koblin, 2014; Seipel, 2016). Success of
policy initiatives is enhanced when key stakeholders are involved in
setting priorities and consider initiatives as both impactful and feasible
(Mello et al., 2006). Thus, we undertook this study to engage professio-
nal models as key stakeholders in assessing policy actions proposed to
decrease pressures toward thinness.
Our research strategy was informed by the triggers-to-action
framework (Mello et al., 2006), which identifies three triggers—eviden-
tiary base, practical (legal) considerations, and political will, as three
necessary pillars for obtaining policy change. Thus, the aims of our
study were threefold. First, we aimed to bridge the gap in available
data regarding the perceived pressures among models to lose weight
or maintain very low weight. We hypothesized that fashion models
would report perceiving various types of pressure from their agents of
other professionals to change their appearance. Second, our aim was
to add to the extant literature by providing additional data regarding
rates of UWCB among fashion models. Given reports of the power
held by modeling agencies (Johnson, 2011), we hypothesized that mod-
els who reported perceiving pressure to change their appearance
would report higher rates of UWCB. Both of these goals aim to
address the first point of the triggers-to-action framework by establish-
ing an evidentiary base. Third, we aimed to assess professional models’
perceptions of the impact and feasibility of seven potential policy pro-
posals aiming to improve the work and health conditions of professio-
nal fashion models. This final goal addresses the second point of the
triggers-to-action framework and explores practical considerations
from the perspective of models regarding ways in which policy can be
used to mitigate the problem. As an exploratory aim, we assessed the
relationship between perceptions of the impact and feasibility of policy
proposals and various sociodemographic characteristics including age,
type of modeling, body mass index (BMI), ethnic/racial identity (White/
non-White), and immigrant status. Type of modeling was examined as
different modeling subcultures may experience different levels of pres-
sure to maintain an extremely thin appearance, which may in turn
impact perceptions of the usefulness of policies aiming to protect mod-
els from these pressures. Age, BMI, ethnic/racial identity and immigrant
status were included as proxies for work insecurity given that the fash-
ion industry tends to favor younger White models with lower BMI and
that maintaining immigrant status may be dependent on employment.

| METHODS
2.1 | Participants and procedures
The study was designed and conducted by researchers (RFR, ASL, KY,
SBA) from two academic institutions as well as a professional model
and founder of the Model Alliance (SZ), a labor advocacy organization
for models working in the American fashion industry. This partnership
contributed to the study design, ensuring that the measures and ques-
tions were relevant to the target population, and orienting recruitment
methods. Fashion models aged 18 years and over participating in New
York Fashion Week in February 2016 were invited to complete an
online survey. No restrictions were based on place of residence. The
survey was circulated via the Internet and social media in February and
March 2016, in particular through the Model Alliance website and
social media platforms. The advertisement stated, “We want to hear

 your thoughts on how to create a healthier work environment!” The
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Northeastern
University. No incentive and compensation was offered.
2.2 | Measures
2.2.1 | Demographic information
Participants provided self-reported age, gender, ethnic/racial identity,
their parents’ highest level of education, and their immigration status in
the U.S. In addition, participants provided information regarding their
work as a model, including the age at which they had begun working as
a model, how long they had been working in the fashion industry, and
the type of modeling they engaged in most. Response options for this
last question were (a) runway modeling, that is working as a model in
fashion shows; (b) editorial modeling, that is modeling clothes for maga-
zines; (c) beauty modeling, that is mainly portrait modeling; (d) catalog
modeling, that is modeling clothes for catalogues; and (e) fit modeling,
that is acting as a live mannequin during the creation of clothes. Lastly,
BMI was calculated (weight in kg/height in m2) using model self-report
height and weight.
2.2.2 | Unhealthy weight control behaviors
Based on items used in previous large-scale, epidemiologic studies that
assess disordered eating and UWCB (Field, Taylor, Celio, & Colditz,
2004; Neumark-Sztainer, Falkner, Story, &, Perry, 2002) participants
were asked to report whether in the past year they had engaged in a
number of behaviors with the purpose of losing weight or changing
their body shape including: dieting, exercising, using fasts/cleanses/
nutritional detoxes, using weight loss supplements or diet pills, using
stimulants such as Ritalin, using intravenous drips such as “banana
bags,” self-induced vomiting, or other methods that participants were
invited to specify. Response options were “never, rarely, sometimes,
often, and always.”
2.2.3 | Pressure from agencies to lose weight and change
physical appearance
Seven questions invited participants to report on the frequency in the
past year with which they had received pressure to modify their
appearance, for example, being told to “tone up” or that they “would
be more successful if [they] lost weight.” Response options were
“never, rarely, sometimes, often, and always.” An open-ended question
allowed participants to specify any additional forms of appearance
pressure they had experienced. An eighth question asked whether par-
ticipants had been asked to lose weight or change their body size/
shape within the last year by someone involved in the fashion industry
including an agent, casting agent, designer or other professional (See
Table 2).
2.2.4 | Impact and feasibility of potential policy proposals
Participants were asked to indicate their perception of the impact on
professional models of seven potential policy approaches, as well as
their feasibility. The list of different policy approaches was developed
by the authors after review the related literature and different policy
proposals developed in the U.S. and abroad, and based on previous pol-
icy research methods (Puhl, Neumark-Sztainer, Austin, Suh, & Wake-
field, 2016; Puhl, Neumark-Sztainer, Austin, Luedicke, & King, 2014).
Feedback was solicited from a group of eating disorders experts at the
Harvard T Chan School of Public Health. The list of potential policy
approaches was then refined and finalized. Example policy actions
included establishing minimum BMI criteria, and requiring larger sample
size clothing to be available at fashion shows, which would give runway
models with a wider range of body sizes the opportunity to model.
Response options for the perceived impact of the policies suggested
were “very negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive,
and very positive.” Response options for perceived feasibility were
“very difficult, somewhat difficult, neutral, easy, and very easy.”
2.3 | Data analyses
Frequencies and descriptive statistics were examined for all variables.
As only one participant reported being male, he was excluded from the
subsequent analyses. In terms of immigration status, citizens and legal
permanent residents were compared to visitors or other nonresidents.
The variables assessing the frequency with which, over the past year,
participants had been asked to lose weight or change their body
shape/size by someone in the industry, and engaged in UWCB were
dichotomized such that responses “never” and “rarely” were scored 0
and responses “sometimes,” “often,” and “always” were scored 1. v2d
analyses using these dichotomous outcomes were conducted to com-
pare the prevalence of UWCB among models who had been asked to
lose weight and those who had not. Multivariable logistic regression
controlling for age and BMI were then conducted to estimate the
increased odds of engaging in UWCB among participants who had
been asked to lose weight. The perceived policy impact and feasibility
were descriptively compared. In addition, Friedman and Kendall’s W
tests were conducted to examine differences in ratings across the
seven policy proposals. Spearman rank correlations were conducted to
examine the relationship between perceived policy impact and feasibil-
ity and age, length of employment in the industry, type of modeling,
BMI, ethnic/racial identity (White/non-White), and immigrant status.

| RESULTS
3.1 | Sample characteristics
A sample of 85 female fashion models, mean age 5 22.7 years (SD 3.7)
participated in the study (Table 1). The mean age for when participants
started modeling was 16.8 years (SD 3.1) with models starting work as
young as five years old. Mean BMI was 17.5 kg/m2, ranging from 14.5
to 26.4. However, 81% of the sample had a BMI under 18.5, and only
4 participants had a BMI over 20. Just over half of the sample (59%)
were U.S. citizens, 7% were legal permanent residents with approxi-
mately 34% being visitors or other nonresidents. The majority of the
sample (74%) was White, while 11% of the sample was African Ameri-
can, 1% was Asian, and 4% identified as Latina, and 10% identified as
multiracial. Sixty-seven percent of the sample had a mother who had a

 college degree or higher, and 66% of the sample had a father with at
least a college degree.
3.2 | Prevalence and predictors of pressure from
agents and unhealthy weight control behaviors
Overall, models reported high levels of pressure to lose weight from
their agencies and reported having been “often” or “always” told by
their agencies in the past year to tone up (44%), lose weight (36%), or
adopt a new diet or exercise regimen (32%). Some had even been pro-
vided with pills or substances for weight loss (5%) (Table 2). Further-
more, models reported having been “often” or “always” told by their
agencies in the past year that they would be more successful if they
lost weight (37%), would not be able to find any more jobs unless they
lost weight (23%), and that their agencies would cease to represent
them unless they lost weight (11%).
Consistent with this pressure, participants experienced high levels
of UWCB (Table 3) and reported “sometimes, often, or always” engag-
ing in the following behaviors for weight loss in the past year: skipping
meals (56%), dieting (71%), fasts/cleanses/detoxes (52%), using weight-
loss supplements or diet pills (23%), self-induced vomiting (8%), and
using stimulants such as Ritalin (16%) or cocaine (7%), or using intrave-
nous drips (2%).
v2 analyses revealed that models who had been asked over the
past year to lose weight or change their shape reported more fre-
quently skipping meals (v2 5 29.70, p < .001), dieting (v2 5 27.06,
p < .001), exercising to change their shape and weight (v2 5 8.12, p5
.008), going on fasts/cleanses/detoxes (v2 5 22.40, p < .001), using of
weight loss supplements or diet pills (v2 5 8.52, p 5 .003), and using
stimulants (v2 5 6.65, p 5 .01). Multivariable logistic regressions (Table
4) revealed that, controlling for age and BMI, being asked over the past
year to lose weight or change their shape was associated with higher
odds of skipping meals (OR5 11.86, 95% CI [3.27–42.86], p < .001),
dieting (OR 5 19.38, 95% CI [4.39–85.54], p < .001), exercising to

p 5 .038), going on fasts/cleanses/detoxes (OR 5 6.76, 95% CI [2.17–

(OR 5 5.80, 95% CI [1.19–28.3], p 5 .03), although this last odds should
be interpreted with some caution given that the overall model predict-
ing use of weight loss supplements or diet pills was nonsignificant, and
that the ratio of events/predictor was slightly lower than recom-
mended for adequate power (Vittinghoff & McCulloch, 2007).
3.3 | Perceptions of policy approaches
The Friedman test and Kendall’s coefficient of concordance revealed a
significant difference in ratings across policies in terms of impact and
feasibility, v2 (6) 5 137.41, p < .001, W 5 0.27, and v2 (6) 5 139.93,
p < .001, W 5 0.27, respectively, indicating a moderate to large differ-
ence across the policies in the ratings. The policy approaches rated as
having the most positive impact (Table 5) were regulating model
employment status to increase job security and protections (policy #6)
and regulating model compensation to ensure payment in wages (pol-
icy # 5), which were both rated on average between “somewhat posi-
tive” and “very positive.” However, these approaches were rated as
only moderately feasible, with average ratings falling between “some-
what difficult” and “neutral.” Requiring employers to provide food and
a 30-min break for jobs longer than 6 h (policy #2) was rated positively
in terms of both impact (on average between “somewhat positive” and
“very positive”) and fairly feasible (on average between “neutral” and
“somewhat easy” to implement). Imposing restrictions on minimum
BMI (policy #1) was rated as the least helpful approach in terms of
impact, and feasibility ratings fell between “somewhat difficult” and
“very difficult.”
3.3.1 | Correlates of perceived policy impact
The type of modeling participants engaged in was related to their eval-
uations of the impact of potential policy approaches, although the mag-
nitude of these relationships was small. Working in runway modeling
was associated with evaluating policies setting minimum BMI require-
ments more negatively (policy #1; rho 5 2.24, p < .05), however, work-
ing in catalog modeling was associated with rating this policy option
more positively (rho5 .28, p < .01). Engaging in editorial modeling was
associated with evaluating the impact of policies aiming to increase job
security as having a less positive impact (policy #6; rho 5 2.22,
p < .05). Finally, working in beauty modeling was associated with evalu-
ating policies requiring larger sample sizes to be available more posi-
tively (policy #7; rho 5 .25, p < .05). In contrast, there was a trend
associating runway modeling work with evaluating this option as hav-
ing a less positive impact (rho5 2.20, p 5 .06).
Participants’ BMI also revealed associations with policy ratings in
terms of impact. Participants with higher BMIs evaluated policies propos-
ing minimum BMI requirements as having a more positive impact (policy
#1; rho5 .23, p< .05), as well as policies requiring health checkups (policy
#3; rho5 .28, p< .01) and policies preventing employment termination
due to changes in weight and shape (policy #4; rho5 .36, p< .001).
Age, amount of time in the industry, and ethnic/racial minority sta-
tus had few statistically significant correlations with policy appraisals.
Older models tended to view proposals aiming to increase job security
as more positive (policy #6; rho 5 .24, p < .05). Finally, White partici-
pants evaluated policies setting minimum BMI requirements as having
a more positive impact as compared to non-White participants (policy
#1; rho 5 .31, p < .01). No significant correlations emerged between
immigration status and perceived policy impact.
3.3.2 | Correlates of perceived policy feasibility
The type of modeling engaged in by participants revealed few associa-
tions with evaluations of the feasibility of potential policy approaches.
Working in beauty modeling was associated with evaluating policies
aiming to increase job security and protection (policy #6; rho 5 .24,
p < .05) and policies requiring larger sample sizes to be available (policy
#7; rho 5 .35, p 5 .001) as more feasible.
Participants’ BMI revealed associations with policy ratings in terms
of feasibility. Participants with higher BMIs were more likely to evalu-
ate policies proposing minimum BMI requirements as being more feasi-
ble (policy #1; rho 5 .25, p < .05). Again, age, amount of time in the
industry, and ethnic/racial minority status had few statistically signifi-
cant correlations with policy appraisals. A greater number of years
working in the fashion industry was associated with viewing policies
aiming to establish regular health checkups as less feasible (policy #3;
rho 5 2.24, p < .05). No significant correlations emerged between
immigration status and perceived policy feasibility.

 sometimes created at the cost of the fashion models’ health due to the
pressures they experience to embody the thin-ideal, as well as the
health of the wider population, particularly among adolescent girls in
whom exposure to these images is associated with higher risk for eat-
ing disorders (Levine & Murnen, 2009; Preti et al., 2008). Recently, pol-
icy proposals aiming to increase the regulation of the industry to
protect professional models and limit the dissemination of thin-ideal
images have emerged both in the U.S. and several other nations around
the world (Record & Austin, Koblin, 2014; Seipel, 2016). Given the
importance of involving key stakeholders in the development of policy
proposals to ensure their success, strategic science constitutes a valua-
ble approach to further these regulatory efforts.
The first two goals of this study aimed to add to the evidentiary
base supporting the need for policy change related to the work of fash-
ion models, by bridging the gap in available data regarding the per-
ceived pressures among models to lose weight or maintain very low
weight, and adding to the extant literature by providing additional data
regarding rates of UWCB among fashion models. Specifically, we first
hypothesized that fashion models would report various types of per-
ceived pressure from their agents and other professionals to change
their appearance. Our findings provide support for this hypothesis, as
well as additional evidence that fashion models experience high levels
of pressure from their agencies to lose weight and maintain a very low
body weight.
Our findings are also consistent with our second hypothesis,
namely that models who reported perceived pressure to change their
appearance would report higher rates of UWCB. Overall, our findings
suggest that rates of UWCB are fairly high in this group and associated
with pressures exerted by the industry. As a comparison, in a large
sample of young women of mean age 23.2 years, rates of dieting and
diet pill use in the last year were found to be 54.6% and 12.4%, respec-
tively (Neumark-Sztainer, Wall, Larson, Eisenberg, & Loth, 2011) com-
pared to 70.5% and 23.6% in our sample. This group was also found to
be vulnerable to engaging in disordered eating and weight control
behaviors, which is consistent with previous research (Zancu & Enea, in
press). In addition, the large majority (81%) of our sample reported a
BMI < 18.5, which indicates underweight according to World Health
Organization criteria and is associated with hormonal dysregulation,
poor bone density, infertility, impaired growth and development in ado-
lescents and young adults, and other adverse health consequences

 (Hudson & Court, 2012; Status, 1995). These findings confirm both that
fashion models are a vulnerable group and that the pressure to maintain
very low body weight contributes to the presence of thin-ideal content
in the media, which in turn has been suggested to increase eating disor-
der risk at the population level (Levine & Murnen, 2009).
The third goal of our study was to assess professional models’ per-
ceptions of the impact and feasibility of seven potential policy pro-
posals
aiming
to
improve
the
work
and
health
conditions
of
professional fashion models, as a means of exploring practical aspects
of such polices. Our findings revealed that policy options that were eval-
uated most favorably by models were those aiming to improve work and
financial security. This suggests that models are most favorable toward
policies that would help to redress the power differential within the fash-
ion industry and improve work conditions, rather than the policy pro-
posals that most directly targeted weight and shape pressures.
One of the policy proposals that has been formulated in an effort
to reduce the pressure to be thin among models, and the resulting pro-
motion of the thin-ideal, has focused on setting a minimum BMI
threshold for professional models (Record & Austin, 2015). Our find-
ings indicate that approaches that set a minimum BMI threshold are
not supported by models, in that they are perceived as unlikely to have
a positive impact and difficult to implement. Instead, providing models
with more employment protections and healthier working conditions
(e.g., meals and breaks) are most supported by these key stakeholders.
One explanation for these findings might be that professional models
display high levels of endorsement and internalization of the thin-ideal,
and therefore consider it appropriate for models to be extremely slen-
der. In addition, some models may naturally be very slender, and per-
ceive such a policy as limiting their employment prospects. It is also,
however, likely that professional fashion models perceive pressure to
be thin as only one consequence of their precarious employment situa-
tions and the power imbalance between agents, models, and client
within the fashion industry. Importantly, in the U.S., fashion models are
generally considered to be independent contractors, not employees,
which contributes to poor health and safety protections. Thus, from a
more systemic perspective, policy proposals affording fashion models
greater employment security or autonomy and adequate compensation
may in turn empower them to resist pressures from modeling agencies
and other professionals to lose weight or change their appearance or
their bodies in ways that put their health at risk to maintain their
employment.
Interestingly, findings from our exploratory aim revealed that per-
ceived policy impact and feasibility varied according to sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, including the type of modeling participants
engaged in and their BMI. Specifically, models who reported working in
runway modeling were more likely to negatively evaluate policies aim-
ing to set minimum BMI requirements or requiring larger sample sizes
to be available. In contrast, these options were rated more favorably by
participants who worked in catalog or beauty modeling. In addition,
participants with higher BMI were more likely to evaluate policies aim-
ing to set minimum BMI requirements as having a more positive impact
and being more feasible. These findings suggest that the models most
likely to be affected by such policies evaluate them the most nega-
tively. It may be that models with lower BMIs are best placed to evalu-
ate the ways in which such policies might potentially have paradoxical
effects, in that their implementation might encourage weight loss
attempts immediately preceding fashion shows or simply be ineffective.
Similarly, these findings might also suggest that models who experience
less appearance pressure do not perceive some of the barriers and
issues that are more apparent to the subgroup experiencing the most
appearance pressure. However, again it may also be that models who
are thinner endorse the thin-ideal to a greater extent, and may even
perceive this as being a factor contributing to their success, and thus
be reluctant to see minimum BMIs introduced.
A broader aim of our work was to present findings from a strategic
science study in the context of eating disorders, with the goal of

 encouraging and informing future efforts in this vein. Such research
aims to respond to the need to accelerate the translation of research
to policy and practice in this field, so as to increase the potential for
large-scale public health impact (Austin, 2016; Austin, Yu, Tran, &
Mayer, in press). This study presents an illustration of timely research
aiming to contribute to the creation and implementation of policy that
will be helpful to end-users, in this case, professional fashion models,
while simultaneously contributing to universal prevention of eating dis-
orders. Designing research that both addresses the concerns and expe-
riences of stakeholder groups and generates data that can be used to
support prevention strategies is critical for the success of strategic
research.
Our study has a number of strengths. In particular, it is one of a
handful of studies, and the largest to date, to explore disordered eating
among professional models, and in particular to examine rates of spe-
cific UWCB. Thus, it makes a significant contribution to the existing lit-
erature. In addition, it is the first study to examine professional models’
perceptions of the impact and feasibility of a range of potential policy
actions aiming to improve models’ work conditions. A final strength is
the collaboration of individuals from both the field of research and pro-
fessional modeling on the design and implementation of the research
study, which is essential in strategic science.
However, our study also presents a number of limitations. First,
given the difficulties of obtaining parental consent in an often transient
model population, we were unable to include minors. As our data indi-
cate, many models start working younger than age 18 years, and it
would be important to understand their perceptions of potential policy
actions. In addition, within the confines of an Internet survey, we were
unable to gain a deeper understanding of the reasons for which certain
policy proposals were evaluated more or less positively. Qualitative
data would be useful for obtaining a more detailed understanding, par-
ticularly in terms of whether the policies evaluated more favorable
were seen by models as being the most empowering. Furthermore,
model BMI was estimated using self-report data, which are less reliable
than objectively obtained height and weight data. However, the mean
of 17.5 kg/m2 reported in our sample is very close to the mean of
17.7 kg/m2 reported by Santonastaso et al. (2002) in their sample of
models. Of note, the other measures included were also self-report and
retrospective which somewhat limits their reliability and validity. Fur-
thermore, our questions assessed only for potentially unhealthy pres-
sures from agencies to the exclusion of helpful behaviors, which may
have provided a biased view of the involvement of agencies in models’
appearance. Finally, it should be noted that the recruitment through
the Model Alliance social media platforms, as well as the framing of the
advertisement, might have led to the recruitment of a sample of mod-
els that is not representative of the broader group and an oversampling
of participants who were interested in seeing change in their work
environment. Future studies should aim to collect a more representa-
tive sample.
In conclusion, future efforts to develop policies to improve work-
ing conditions of professional models and indirectly decrease the glori-
fication of extreme thinness in the media should build on these
findings and continue to engage professional models and other fashion
industry professionals as key stakeholders in policy translation research
and action. In addition, further efforts should be made to conduct
research based in the approach of strategic science to accelerate the
development of policies supporting universal prevention of eating
disorders.
