‘. . . coffee sets the blood in motion and stimulates the
muscles; it accelerates the digestive processes, chases
away sleep, and gives us the capacity to engage a little
longer in the exercise of our intellects.’
Honoré de Balzac (paraphrasing Brillat-Savarin)
Traité des Excitants Modernes (1838),
(translated from the French by Robert Onopa)
Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive drug
in the world. It is found in more than 60 known
species of plants, and dietary sources include coffee,
tea, cocoa beverages, chocolate and soft drinks. Coffee
was consumed in Arabia in the 13th century and
was introduced into Europe in the early 17th century.
Tea was probably drunk in China before the birth of
Christ and was brought to Europe in the 16th century.
Most dietary caffeine is still consumed as tea and
coffee, and the latter accounts for 55% of per capita
intake in the UK (Scott et al, 1989). Despite (or
perhaps because of) its ubiquity, caffeine is rarely
thought of as a problematic drug. Doctors do not
often ask patients about its use and enquiry into
caffeine consumption is not usually included in
psychiatric assessment.
On average, a cup of brewed coffee contains
100 mg of caffeine, compared with 75 mg for instant
coffee and 50 mg for tea (Food Standards Agency,
2001); a can of Coca Cola contains 30 mg. Increas-
ingly, stimulant drinks such as Red Bull (80 mg of
caffeine per can) are being marketed to the public,
and sales have increased dramatically since they first
became available in 1987 (Finnegan, 2003). Pharma-
ceutical caffeine may be bought over the counter (for
example as ProPlus tablets) and is also contained in
numerous proprietary analgesics, cold and ’flu
remedies, diet pills and diuretics; Anadin Extra, for
example, contains 90 mg of caffeine per dose. In the
UK, mean caffeine consumption is estimated at
359 mg/day (Scott et al, 1989).
Effects and diagnostic
classification
The primary effect of caffeine is to relieve fatigue and
enhance mental performance. Excessive ingestion
leads to a state of intoxication known as caffeinism,
which is characterised by restlessness, agitation,
excitement, rambling thought and speech, and
insomnia. These symptoms clearly overlap with
those of many psychiatric disorders. The potential
harmful effects of caffeine have long been recognised.
As long ago as 1900, the Journal of the American Medical
Association reported a conference on ‘Coffee as a
beverage: its deleterious effects on the nervous
system’, at which a contributor complained that
‘most physicians had given the subject little if any
attention’. Another contributor asserted that coffee
could cause a variety of symptoms, including
depression, irritability, insomnia, tremulousness,
loss of appetite and ‘frequent eructations of gas’
(JAMA, 2001).

Neuropsychiatric effects of caffeine
Anthony P. Winston, Elizabeth Hardwick & Neema Jaberi
Abstract
Psychiatrists rarely enquire about caffeine intake when assessing patients. This may lead to a failure to
identify caffeine-related problems and offer appropriate interventions. Excessive caffeine ingestion
leads to symptoms that overlap with those of many psychiatric disorders. Caffeine is implicated in the
exacerbation of anxiety and sleep disorders, and people with eating disorders often misuse it. It
antagonises adenosine receptors, which may potentiate dopaminergic activity and exacerbate psychosis.
In psychiatric in-patients, caffeine has been found to increase anxiety, hostility and psychotic symptoms.
Assessment of caffeine intake should form part of routine psychiatric assessment and should be carried
out before prescribing hypnotics. Gradual reduction in intake or gradual substitution with caffeine-free
alternatives is probably preferable to abrupt cessation. Decaffeinated beverages should be provided on
psychiatric wards.
 Neuropsychiatric effects of caffeine
433

/apt.rcpsych.org/
Four caffeine-related syndromes are recognised in
DSM–IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994):
caffeine intoxication; caffeine-induced anxiety
disorder; caffeine-induced sleep disorder; and
caffeine-related disorder not otherwise specified.
Caffeine withdrawal is included in the Appendix
to DSM–IV under ‘Criteria sets and axes provided
for further study’. The ICD–10 (World Health
Organization, 1992) is less specific. It recognises
‘Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of other
stimulants, including caffeine’ (F15), which are then
sub-classified in the same way as other substance
use disorders (acute intoxication, harmful use,
dependence syndrome, withdrawal state, etc.).
However, there is no specific guidance on diagnosing
problems due to caffeine misuse, and the diagnostic
criteria are the same as for other substance use
disorders. The prevalence of the various caffeine-
related syndromes is uncertain.
Despite this formal recognition, caffeine generally
receives little attention from psychiatrists. For
example, the New Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry
(Gelder et al, 2003) does not discuss caffeine misuse,
although caffeine is mentioned briefly as a cause of
insomnia. Consequently, psychiatrists rarely enquire
about caffeine intake when assessing patients. This
may lead to a failure to identify caffeine-related
problems and offer appropriate interventions.
This article describes the clinical effects of caffeine
consumption in a variety of psychiatric disorders
and offers some guidance on assessing and manag-
ing caffeine-related problems.
Biochemistry and pharmacology
of caffeine
Caffeine is a methylxanthine (1,3,7-trimethyl-
xanthine). The effects of this group of chemicals
include stimulation of the central nervous system
(CNS), diuresis, stimulation of cardiac muscle and
relaxation of smooth muscle. Caffeine initially
stimulates the CNS at the level of the cerebral cortex
and medulla and only later stimulates the spinal
cord (at higher doses). Its effects begin within 1 h
and last for 3–4 h (Baker & Theologus, 1972). Caffeine
is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract
and then metabolised by demethylation and oxida-
tion in the liver. There is some individual variation
in the rate of metabolism; the half-life is reduced in
smokers but increased in pregnancy and in women
taking oral contraceptives (Finnegan, 2003).
Biochemically, the main action of caffeine is
anatagonism of adenosine A1 and A2 receptors.
Higher doses cause inhibition of phosphodiester-
ases, blockade of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)
receptors and release of intracellular calcium (Daly
& Fredholm, 1998; Finnegan, 2003). Neuropsy-
chiatric effects are mediated largely by blockade
of A1 and A2A receptors in the CNS. Adenosine A1
receptors are present in almost all brain areas, but
particularly in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex,
cerebellar cortex and thalamus.
There are important connections between aden-
osine receptors and the dopaminergic system, which
may be relevant to the effects of caffeine in psychosis
(see below, in the subsection ‘Schizophrenia’).
Adenosine A2A receptors are concentrated in the
dopamine-rich regions of the brain and are thought
to have considerable links with dopaminergic
receptors (Ferre et al, 1992; Lorist & Tops, 2003). More-
over, there is evidence that the stimulatory effects of
caffeine require intact dopaminergic neurotrans-
mission (Ferre et al, 1992). These stimulatory effects
appear to result primarily from blockade of A2A
receptors, which stimulate inhibitory GABAergic
neurons in pathways to the dopaminergic reward
system of the striatum (Daly & Fredholm, 1998).
Blockade of adenosine receptors also reverses the
inhibition of adrenaline release in the sympathetic
nervous system and results in sympathetic stimu-
lation (Kruger, 1996).
Elsewhere in the body, caffeine causes relaxation
of smooth muscle (especially bronchial smooth
muscle) and stimulation of cardiac muscle; these
effects resemble those of β-adrenoceptor stimulation.
The stimulatory effect on the heart can result in
tachycardia at high doses.
Psychological effects
The psychological effects of caffeine are biphasic.
Low doses produce stimulation, which is often
perceived as desirable, whereas high doses can
cause the unpleasant effects of caffeinism (Daly
& Fredholm, 1998). Caffeine increases alertness,
reduces fatigue and can elevate mood (Leinart &
Huber, 1966; Rogers & Dernoncourt, 1997; Smith,
2002). Normal consumption improves performance
on tasks that require alertness, such as simulated
driving tasks (Smith, 2002). The effect on more
complex cognitive tasks is less clear, although there
is evidence to suggest that high consumption is
associated with better performance, especially in
older people (Smith, 2002).
Adverse effects
Caffeine has a number of adverse effects on the gastro-
intestinal tract. It relaxes the lower oesophageal
sphincter and can predispose to gastro-oesophageal
reflux disease. It also causes gastric hypersecretion,
which is associated with susceptibility to ulceration.
 434

Winston et al
It increases the rate of gastric emptying and the acidic
gastric contents therefore pass more rapidly into the
duodenum; this can lead to inflammation of the
duodenal mucosa (Boekema et al, 1999).
The diuretic action of caffeine is well known. The
public is often advised to abstain from consuming
caffeine in situations where dehydration may be
significant, such as long-haul flights. A recent review
(Maughan & Griffin, 2003) concluded that single
doses of caffeine such as those found in commonly
consumed beverages have little or no diuretic action,
although large doses (>250 mg) do.
Caffeine may precipitate sinus tachycardia but
does not increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias,
except perhaps at very high dose (Katan & Schouten,
2005). It can trigger migraine in susceptible
individuals (Goadsby, 2003). Excessive use of
caffeine-containing analgesics has been linked to
analgesic nephropathy (De Broe et al, 2003). Caffeine
may also be harmful in pregnancy; intakes above
300 mg/day may be associated with low birth weight
and miscarriage (Food Standards Agency, 2001;
Parazzini et al, 2005). The UK Food Standards
Agency has recommended that pregnant women
should limit their intake to less than this amount,
which is equivalent to four average-sized cups or
three average-sized mugs of instant coffee or six
average-sized cups of tea (Food Standards Agency,
2001).
Dependence and withdrawal
Caffeine acts as a reinforcing agent in both humans
and animals (Griffiths & Munford, 1995), although
its effect is less powerful than that of stimulants such
as cocaine and amphetamine (Daly & Fredholm,
1998). The reinforcing effect is thought to be due to
both pleasurable stimulatory effects and unpleasant
withdrawal symptoms (Daly & Fredholm, 1998).
Caffeine differs from classical drugs of misuse in
causing dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex
rather than the nucleus accumbens, which is the
principal area involved in reward and addiction
(Nehlig, 1999).
Withdrawal symptoms have been reported in both
humans and animals (Schuh & Griffiths, 1997;
Griffiths & Woodson, 1998). Well-recognised symp-
toms include headache, irritability, sleeplessness,
confusion, nausea, anxiety, restlessness and tremor,
palpitations and raised blood pressure (Finnegan,
2003). They typically start slowly, are at their worst
at 1–2 days, and recede within a few days. They are
rapidly relieved by intake of caffeine, suggesting that
they are genuine withdrawal symptoms. Tolerance
has been reported to the effects of caffeine on the
respiratory and cardiovascular systems, but there is
little tolerance to its effect on sleep or mood (Daly
& Fredholm, 1998).
Data on the prevalence of withdrawal symptoms
are inconsistent, with a range of 11% or less to 100%
(Dews et al, 2002). One study found that 7.5% of the
population may experience adverse effects following
either caffeine consumption or withdrawal (Scott et
al, 1989). In another study (Dews et al, 1999), 11% of
caffeine consumers reported withdrawal symptoms.
Among regular caffeine users, only 0.9% of males
and 5.5% of females reported withdrawal symptoms
significant enough to interfere with normal activities.
Withdrawal symptoms appear to be more common
in teenagers: in one sample, 77.8% reported with-
drawal symptoms and 41.7% tolerance (Bernstein
et al, 2002).
Overall, clinically significant withdrawal symp-
toms seem to be relatively uncommon in the general
population (Dews et al, 1999). It has been suggested
that there is a definable caffeine dependence
syndrome, on the basis that some adults meet the
DSM–IV criteria for substance dependence (Strain
et al, 1994). However, many studies of caffeine
withdrawal have methodological limitations (Smith,
2002) and the status of caffeine as a drug of
dependence remains controversial.
Caffeine and psychiatric disorder
Consumption of caffeine may be higher in psychiatric
patients than in the population as a whole (Greden
et al, 1978; Galliano, cited in Scott et al, 1989). Caffeine
use has been linked with specific disorders such as
anxiety disorders, sleep disorders and eating
disorders, and there is a possible association
with schizophrenia. Surprisingly, there are no pub-
lished reports linking caffeine use with mania or
hypomania.
Anxiety disorders
The resemblance between the symptoms of excessive
caffeine ingestion and those of anxiety is obvious
and they may both have a basis in overactivity of the
sympathetic nervous system. It has been argued that
the symptoms of caffeinism are indistinguishable
from those of anxiety (Greden, 1974). However,
caffeinism is normally associated with a daily intake
of 1000–1500 mg, and the relevance of Greden’s
observation to lower doses is uncertain (Smith, 2002).
There is a substantial literature documenting the
anxiogenic effects of caffeine in both experimental
and realistic situations (e.g. Chait, 1992; Brice &
Smith, 2002; Botella & Parra, 2003). The stimulation
of anxiety in response to caffeine may be due to
increased levels of lactate in the brain (Tancer et al,
 Neuropsychiatric effects of caffeine
435
Advances in Psychiatric Treatment (2005), vol. 11. http:/
/apt.rcpsych.org/
1991, 1994). The role of adenosine in mediating
caffeine-induced anxiety is supported by the finding
that there is an association between different anxiety
levels after caffeine administration and poly-
morphisms on the A2A receptor gene (Alsene et al,
2003).
Clinically, caffeine may be involved in the precipi-
tation, exacerbation or maintenance of anxiety
disorders (Kruger, 1996). Sensitivity to caffeine is
increased in people with panic disorder and social
phobia, and administration of caffeine can provoke
panic attacks in these individuals (Charney et al,
1985; Tancer et al, 1991, 1994). There are clinical
reports of anxiety symptoms improving on caffeine
withdrawal or limitation (Greden, 1974; Bruce &
Lader, 1989), and people suffering panic attacks may
benefit from a reduction in their intake (Charney
et al, 1985).
Sleep disorders
It is well-known that caffeine produces insomnia.
It reduces slow-wave sleep in the early part of the
sleep cycle and can reduce rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep later in the cycle (Nicholson & Stone,
1980). Caffeine increases episodes of wakefulness
(Brezinova et al, 1975), and high doses in the late
evening can increase the time taken to fall asleep
(Smith, 2002). In elderly people, the use of medication
containing caffeine is associated with an increased
risk of difficulty in falling asleep (Brown et al, 1995).
Eating disorders
Clinical experience suggests that people with eating
disorders such as bulimia nervosa and anorexia
nervosa often consume large quantities of drinks
containing caffeine, in the belief that caffeine
increases metabolic rate and suppresses appetite. In
people with anorexia nervosa, who are already at
high risk of cardiac arrhthymias, the stimulant effect
of caffeine on the heart may be dangerous. Excessive
caffeine ingestion may also contribute to osteo-
porosis, which has a high prevalence in anorexia
nervosa (Deal, 1997).
Surprisingly, caffeine consumption in people with
eating disorders has received little attention in the
literature. There is only one published study, carried
out in the USA, that focuses on caffeine intake in this
population (Krahn et al, 1991). This study of
individuals with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa
and eating disorder not otherwise specified found
that 14.6% had a high caffeine intake (over 750 mg/
day), 39.2% had a moderate intake (250–750 mg/
day) and 46.3% had a low intake (<250 mg/day).
High and moderate intakes were associated with an
increased frequency of binge eating, compared with
low intake. Those in the high-intake group were also
more likely to misuse laxatives and diet pills and
have higher levels of anxiety. High and moderate
intake were associated with high scores on the
Michigan Alcohol Screening Test. We are currently
conducting a study of caffeine use in British people
with eating disorders.
Schizophrenia
It has already been noted that there are connections
between adenosine A2A
 receptors and the dopamin-
ergic system in the brain. As adenosine inhibits
dopaminergic neurotransmission, blockade of A2A
receptors by caffeine may increase dopaminergic
activity and exacerbate psychotic symptoms (Ferre
et al, 1992). Clinically, the symptoms of caffeine
intoxication can mimic those of psychosis (Kruger,
1996) or be confused with the side-effects of medi-
cation (Hughes et al, 1998). Cessation of caffeine
causes fatigue and drowsiness, which can be
confused with the side-effects of psychotropic drugs
(Hughes et al, 1998).
There is also evidence that people with schizo-
phrenia have higher than average intakes of caffeine,
although the literature is inconsistent. There are a
number of case reports of high caffeine intake among
in-patients with schizophrenia (Benson & David,
1986; Zaslove et al, 1991). Studies published in the
1970s give conflicting results, one finding that 71%
of in-patients used more than 500 mg of caffeine per
day (Winstead, 1976) and the other that only 17%
used more than this amount (Furlong, 1975). A more
recent study found that the mean daily caffeine
intake of 26 in-patients was 503 mg, with 38% using
more than 555 mg (Mayo et al, 1993).
Several theories have been advanced as to why
people with schizophrenia might have high intakes
of caffeine (Hughes et al, 1998). These include using
caffeine to relieve boredom and apathy and to offset
the sedating effects of antipsychotic medication.
Many psychotropic drugs produce a dry mouth,
which might increase the intake of caffeinated drinks.
About 80% of people with schizophrenia smoke
(Lohr & Flynn, 1992) and these individuals may use
more caffeine to make up for the increased elimination
of caffeine due to heavy smoking (Swanson et al,
1994).
There have been a number of case reports of
delusions and hallucinations after large intakes
of caffeine by people both with (Mikkelsen, 1978;
Zaslove et al, 1991) and without psychosis
(McManamy & Schube, 1936; Rush et al, 1995).
One study of 78 people with schizophrenia found
that caffeine intake was correlated with positive
symptoms but not with negative symptoms (Goff
 436
Advances in Psychiatric Treatment (2005), vol. 11. http:/
/apt.rcpsych.org/
Winston et al
et al, 1992). Another, small study found only a slight
correlation between caffeine intake and severity of
psychosis (Hamera et al, 1995).
Three studies have attempted to determine the
effect of caffeine on psychotic symptoms in in-
patients by comparing the effect of caffeinated and
decaffeinated beverages. All used the Brief Psy-
chiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; self-reported) and the
Nurses Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation
(NOSIE; nurse rated). The first found that scores on
the anxiety and hostility sub-scales of the BPRS and
irritability scores on the NOSIE were higher when
caffeine was being consumed (De Freitas & Schwartz,
1979). The second found that scores for hostility,
hallucinations and unusual thought content on the
BPRS and for irritability and psychosis on the NOSIE
were correlated with caffeine intake (Koczapski et al,
1989). However, these changes were small and
statistically questionable. The third study found no
relationship on either scale between caffeine intake
and anxiety, depression or total scores (Mayo et al,
1993).
In an experimental study, caffeine was admin-
istered intravenously to 13 patients with schizo-
phrenia who had been caffeine free for 6 weeks
(Lucas et al, 1990). The dose used (10 mg/kg of body
weight) was the equivalent of drinking seven cups
of brewed coffee in a row. Caffeine increased both
the total score and the unusual thoughts sub-scale
score on the BPRS. Conversely, caffeine decreased
withdrawal/retardation. Interestingly, this large
dose did not increase anxiety scores. The results of
this study are consistent with those of the clinical
studies described above, but they need to be
interpreted with caution because of the large dose
and the lack of a control group of people without
schizophrenia (Hughes et al, 1998).
Interaction with antipsychotics
Caffeine has been shown to react in vitro with
antipsychotics to form an insoluble precipitate
(Hirsch, 1979), which could lead to decreased
absorption (Kruger, 1996). Evidence also suggests
that it may compete with clozapine for metabolism
by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 isoenzyme and
could potentiate the side-effects of clozapine (Odom-
White & de Leon, 1996). This has not been tested
experimentally, although a published case report
suggests that caffeine can increase clozapine
levels sufficiently to produce clinically significant
side-effects (Odom-White & de Leon, 1996). The
literature also includes a case report of an individual
with schizophrenia who experienced an acute
exacerbation of psychotic symptoms when clozapine
was combined with caffeinated drinks (Vainer &
Chouinard, 1994).
Substance misuse
Caffeine appears to prime reward-relevant dopamin-
ergic circuits implicated in cocaine misuse, and has
been found to reinstate extinguished cocaine-taking
behaviour in rats (Worley et al, 1994). It may also
influence the intake or actions of alcohol and
benzodiazepines (Daly & Fredholm, 1998). There is
evidence that patients who are addicted to other
drugs use more caffeine than general psychiatric
patients (Hays et al, 1998). Caffeine consumption is
often found to be higher in smokers than in non-
smokers (Istvan & Matarazzo, 1984; Scott et al, 1989).
This may reflect the increased elimination of caffeine
due to heavy smoking, as mentioned above, or a
general need for stimulation. On the other hand, one
small study found that caffeine use was lower in
patients undergoing alcohol detoxification than in
the general population (Pristach et al, 1983).
Children
Caffeine intake is lower in children than in adults,
with a mean daily intake of 14–22 mg for children
between 1 and 9 years of age in the USA (Knight et al,
2004). Intake is likely to be higher in older children
and adolescents, with the majority coming from soft
drinks (Valek et al, 2004). Excessive consumption of
caffeine by children and adolescents has been
identified as a cause of headache, which usually
resolves on withdrawal (Hering-Hanit & Gadoth,
2003). Caffeine is also associated with sleep
disturbance, with shorter nocturnal sleep duration,
increased wake time after sleep onset and increased
daytime sleep (Pollak & Bright, 2003). It is unclear
whether caffeine plays a significant role in behav-
ioural disturbance in children.
Psychiatric in-patients
Among adult psychiatric patients in the USA, a
significant number have been found to use large
amounts of caffeine (750 mg or more per day); such
individuals have higher levels of both anxiety and
depression than those who consume less (Greden
et al, 1978). Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous
system by caffeine puts the body in ‘fight or flight’
mode. In psychiatric in-patients, who can neither
fight nor flee, sympathetic arousal will produce
excitement and anxiety, which may result in
behavioural disturbance (Kruger, 1996).
In a study of long-stay psychiatric in-patients,
switching to decaffeinated coffee for 3 weeks led
to an improvement in anxiety, irritability and
hostility, which was reversed when caffeine was
reintroduced; reintroduction of caffeine also caused
 Neuropsychiatric effects of caffeine
437
Advances in Psychiatric Treatment (2005), vol. 11. http:/
/apt.rcpsych.org/
an increase in psychotic features (De Freitas &
Schwartz, 1979).
In institutionalised adults with learning disability,
caffeine challenge following a period of abstinence
resulted in an increase in disturbed behaviour
(Searle, 1994). It has been reported in a naturalistic
study that higher doses of phenothiazines are
prescribed to in-patients supplied with caffeinated
coffee than to those given decaffeinated (Shisslak
et al, 1985). However, a double-blind crossover study
found no correlation between caffeine consumption
and anxiety, depression or behaviour in long-stay
patients with schizophrenia (Mayo et al, 1993).
Caffeine may antagonise the effect of benzo-
diazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam (File
et al, 1982; Roache & Griffiths, 1987; Kaplan et al,
1990; Kruger, 1996); it has been suggested that
patients may use caffeine to reverse the effects of
sedatives, so creating a vicious cycle (De Freitas
& Schwartz, 1979).
Assessment and treatment
of caffeine-related problems
In summary, although there is little evidence that
caffeine produces clinically significant dependence,
it may play a contributory role in a variety of
psychiatric disorders. Assessment of caffeine intake
should therefore form part of routine psychiatric
assessment. This is particularly important in people
with anxiety and sleep disorders, eating disorders
and substance misuse. Assessment can easily be
incorporated into the assessment of alcohol and drug
use. In people who misuse drugs or have an eating
disorder, it is appropriate to ask about use of over-
the-counter products that contain caffeine. Intake
should be quantified roughly in terms of the number
of cups/mugs of tea or coffee and cans of carbonated
drinks consumed in an average day. This can be
converted into daily caffeine intake (Box 1). Intake
may be classified as low (<250 mg/day), moderate
(250–750 mg/day) or high (>750 mg/day).
Psychiatrists should always enquire about use
of caffeine before prescribing hypnotics. Other
situations where caffeine intake may be relevant
include poor response to hypnotics, recurrent
headaches and palpitations (Greden, 1974). General
practitioners, who see large numbers of patients with
anxiety and sleep disorders, should also be made
aware of the importance of caffeine and encouraged
to ask about its use. Those who consume large
amounts of caffeine should be given information
about is effects and encouraged to reduce their intake.
If overuse of caffeine is established, gradual
reduction in intake or gradual substitution with
caffeine-free alternatives is probably preferable to
abrupt cessation. Decaffeinated coffee and tea are
now readily available. Although there have been
concerns about potential carcinogenic effects when
beverages are decaffeinated chemically, processes
that use water and carbon dioxide seem to be safe.
Caffeine-free cola is also becoming more available.
Those responsible for in-patient psychiatric units
should be aware of the potential role of excessive
caffeine consumption in exacerbating sleep prob-
lems and behavioural disturbance and should
encourage patients to reduce their consumption.
Decaffeinated beverages should be provided on
psychiatric wards.
