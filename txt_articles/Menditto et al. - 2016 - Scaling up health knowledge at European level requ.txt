Abstract: Computerized health care databases have been widely described as an excellent 
opportunity for research. The availability of “big data” has brought about a wave of innovation in 
projects when conducting health services research. Most of the available secondary data sources 
are restricted to the geographical scope of a given country and present heterogeneous structure 
and content. Under the umbrella of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy 
Ageing, collaborative work conducted by the partners of the group on “adherence to prescrip-
tion and medical plans” identified the use of observational and large-population databases to 
monitor medication-taking behavior in the elderly. This article describes the methodology used 
to gather the information from available databases among the Adherence Action Group partners 
with the aim of improving data sharing on a European level. A total of six databases belonging 
to three different European countries (Spain, Republic of Ireland, and Italy) were included in 
the analysis. Preliminary results suggest that there are some similarities. However, these results 
should be applied in different contexts and European countries, supporting the idea that large 
European studies should be designed in order to get the most of already available databases.
Keywords: health care databases, adherence, electronic health records, outcome research
Background
The rise of critical questions on health outcomes, effectiveness, and impact of medical 
plans and therapies on older adults over the last decades has led to an exploration of 
new methodologies and research approaches.1 Computerized health care databases 
have been widely described as an excellent opportunity for secondary data used in 
research.2,3 These databases include electronic health records and administrative data 
already collected from large populations for other purposes, such as hospital discharge, 
prescribed drugs, and procedures. They can be subsequently merged at an individual 
level using unique, anonymized identifiers, making data available for both academic 
and policy research.4,5 Big data, defined as “massive, complex, distributed, and often 
dynamic sets of data”,6 are generated from increasingly diverse sources and offer 
opportunities to better understand known trends and to discover new ones as well 
as relationships that were indiscernible until now. This is due to the “4Vs” (velocity, 
variety, volume, and especially veracity), which in turn depend on data quality and 
assurance. The availability of big data has brought about a wave of innovation in 
projects when conducting health services research,6 thus adding semantic capabilities 
by enriching and tagging anonymized documentation systems automatically fed by 
public health care registries. In these studies, patients can be profiled on the basis of

the potential risk of diverse health outcomes (eg, hospital 
admission, adverse drug events). All this requires advanced 
computational frameworks for high data volume and intensive 
data processing.
The advantages of large-population databases linked at 
the patient level are their large dimension (often the whole 
population of a given country or region), data on real-life 
use, and outcomes and detection of long-term effects 
that are not observable through randomized controlled 
trials. On the other hand, a significant characteristic of 
anonymized repositories of health databases is reusability. 
Indeed, while collection of patient information during trials 
is designed to gather information on a given subject in a 
specific time frame, large-population databases aim to track 
events over patients’ lifetimes, such as drug prescription or 
 
hospitalization, thus enabling multiple information com-
binations that can be used in many different applications. 
Linked health electronic databases represent powerful and 
relatively  
low-cost resources for investigating important 
public health concerns in real-life scenarios covering large 
populations.7,8
Several institutions in Europe are conducting research 
in this field exploring appropriateness of drug use in the 
elderly,9,10 adherence to therapy,11,12 polypharmacy patterns, 
and use of health resources,13,14 but typically as isolated 
bodies. Most of the available secondary data sources are 
restricted to the geographical scope of a given country and 
present heterogeneous structure and content (for example, 
type of collected data, drug, and clinical event terminolo-
gies) even if trends in the recent years have shown that the 
number of studies conducted using multiple databases is on 
the gradual increase.15
Using multiple data sources is not an easy task, as it 
implies a set of multiple actions to be taken, such as data 
and meta-data analysis, identification of common data sets, 
solving privacy and data property issues, and data integration.
Under the umbrella of the European Innovation 
Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP on AHA), 
collaborative work conducted by the partners of the specific 
group (the Adherence Action Group) on “adherence to 
prescription and medical plans” identified the use of obser-
vational databases related to large populations to monitor 
medication-taking behavior in the elderly. A collection of 
characteristics of databases was devised to collaborate in 
building consensus on the use of common elements and 
measures to facilitate data sharing. This article goes into 
detail in a descriptive manner on the methodology used to 
gather the information from the available databases among 
the Adherence Action Group partners with the purpose of 
paving the way toward improved data sharing in order to 
conduct research on a European level by providing a frame-
work to undertake data sharing.
Methods
European Innovation Partnership on 
Active and Healthy Ageing
Under the Innovation Union16 flagship initiative of the 
Europe 2020 Strategy,17 the EIP on AHA was set up as the 
first European innovation public–private partnership bring-
ing together all the relevant actors of the European Union 
(EU), at national and regional levels, in order to tackle bar-
riers to innovation for the societal challenge that active and 
healthy aging represents. The EIP on AHA aims to identify 
and remove persistent barriers to innovation for active and 
healthy aging through interdisciplinary and cross-sectorial 
approaches focused on improving the health and quality of 
life of Europeans, especially older people. The idea under-
pinning the EIP on AHA is to support the long-term sustain-
ability and efficiency of health and social care systems and to 
enhance the competitiveness of EU industry through business 
and expansion in new markets.
Under the pillar of “prevention, screening, and early diag-
nosis”, the EIP on AHA identified the priority area on “adher-
ence to medication and medical plans” (the Adherence Action 
Group) in order to deliver tangible adherence approaches for 
patients in various disease areas, at the regional level and 
in different member states. The Adherence Action Group 
brings together partners representing 68 multistakeholder 
commitments from the national, regional, and local authori-
ties; research centers; academia; industry; enterprises; and 
existing consortiums across the EU.18 The work of this group 
focuses on improving patient adherence to medical plans, 
empowering patients and care givers to take care of their 
health and to be independent, delivering improvements in 
the health care systems, improving existing data evidence on 
aging and adherence, and enhancing communication between 
different actors in the healing and caring process. As part of 
the collaborative work conducted in the group, partners iden-
tified the use of observational and large-population databases 
as a tool to carry out evidence on medication-taking behavior 
in the elderly. To scale up the results individually achieved in 
each country, it is necessary to create a multiheaded network 
of databases sharing a common structure in order to identify 
a minimum common data set that can be freely used by all 
partners joining the network.

Improving data sharing on a European level
The process described here comprises two phases: 1) 
collection and characterization of electronic databases and 
2) measurement of adherence in the older population.
Collection and characterization of 
electronic databases
First, we provided a description of all individual health-
related databases available to the partners taking part in 
the Adherence Action Group in terms of scope, structure, 
 
content, data fields, and records. We also identified com-
mon data elements (CDEs). The different data countries 
were surveyed.
For this purpose, a computer engineer (SR) had set up 
a document containing a total of 23 categorical questions 
regarding the scope of database, structure, content, and data 
sources to describe database metadata (Figure S1). This 
document was sent in July 2014 to all interested partners who 
answered by filling in as many questionnaires as databases 
owned. In case of information over or under detailed, the 
documents were adjusted to fit in the overall document struc-
ture. Two domain experts (AM, AM) validated the provided 
data. Finally, two domain experts (EM, AP-T) analyzed the 
data collected via email. Partners involved in the data col-
lection process reviewed the results and contributed to the 
final manuscript.
Measurement of adherence in the older 
population
Once the different databases were identified and analyzed in 
terms of their characteristics, we collected information on 
research initiatives, in terms of study methods and prelimi-
nary results, in which the Adherence Action Group partners 
were involved. More in detail, we focused on results regarding 
the measurement of adherence in the older population through 
observational studies and based on the already described 
databases. To this end, each partner provided, through a form 
allowing both multiple choice and free text, detailed essential 
information on planned or ongoing research initiatives related 
to adherence in the older population (Figure S2). In those 
cases in which the information provided by partners was over 
or under detailed, small adjustments were made in order to 
adapt provided data to the overall document structure. In the 
second stage, information provided by each research group 
was analyzed in the light of the specificities of each study and 
organized according to the studied aspects related to adher-
ence (ie, objective of the study, data source, population and 
time frame, type of medication, and operational definition of 
adherence indicator, other variables, and outcomes studied). 
Last, research groups were asked to provide, if appropriate, 
preliminary results of respective ongoing studies, key find-
ings of which were extracted and summarized. The first form 
was circulated in September 2014 to partners participating 
in the Adherence Action Group. The form was sent, and the 
results were collected via email.
Results
A total of six databases belonging to three different European 
countries were included in the analysis: the EpiChron 
Integrated Health Database (EpiChron-IHD) from Spain, 
The Irish LongituDinal study on Ageing (TILDA) from the 
Republic of Ireland, the Optimizing Prescription in Elderly 
in Nursing Home from Italy, the L
’Osservatorio Nazionale 
sull’Impiego dei Medicinali from Italy, the Campania Region 
Chronic Disease Analysis from Italy, and the Caserta Health 
Unit Administrative Medication Data Warehouse from Italy 
(Table 1).
The data sources varied from country to country depend-
ing on the level of sophistication of record keeping; data 
collection, analysis, and reporting; and the operational 
considerations of the health care system. Four of the data-
bases described had electronic health record databases as 
data sources established for routine administrative purposes 
(ie, EpiChron-IHD, L
’Osservatorio Nazionale sull’Impiego 
dei Medicinali, Campania Region Chronic Disease Analysis, 
and Caserta Health Unit Administrative Medication Data 
Warehouse), one was related to registry data (Optimizing 
Prescription in Elderly in Nursing Home) and one inte-
grated administrative data sources with patient-reported 
data (TILDA-Health Services Executive Primary Care 
Reimbursement Service [HSE-PCRS]). In particular, for 
the TILDA-HSE-PCRS database, data were linked for 3,122 
older community dwelling participants to the HSE-PCRS 
pharmacy claims database that contained details on all drugs 
dispensed. Of note, EpiChron-IHD also integrated clinical 
information from general practitioners’ medical records 
(Figure 1).
In all databases, drugs were coded using the Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical classification. Diagnoses were 
coded using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification classification in all data-
bases except one where it was coded by using International 
Classification of Primary Care (Table 2).
The databases were specifically used, in the context of 
the EIP on AHA, to carry out studies on multimorbidity, 
polypharmacy, and medication-taking behaviors.

Regarding the measurement of adherence in the older 
population, one of the main findings was the heterogeneity 
of the study designs applied. Although all research initia-
tives were observational, some of them specifically focused 
on potential determinants of nonadherence, whereas others 
on consequences and health outcomes (eg, nonadherence, 
risk of hospitalization, quality of life). Some studies focused 
on specific medications (eg, antiosteoporotic treatment, 
antidepressants) and others on specific chronic diseases 
(eg, ischemic heart disease, neurological diseases, or mental 
diseases). All these studies were related to chronic diseases. 
Medication possession ratio and/or proportion of days cov-
ered were frequently used as indicators to measure adher-
ence and persistence to medication. No studies reported 
adherence to aspects related to medical care besides medica-
tion, such as physician office visit and patient monitoring. 
Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, sex and 
age information was included in all studies. Comorbidity 
and polypharmacy were also variables considered in 
most  
studies. Although most of them were still ongoing, 
 
preliminary results suggested some common findings. For 
example, nonadherence was more prevalent among younger 
people and highly influenced by the concomitant presence 
of mental health problems. Furthermore, comorbidity and 
complexity of drug regimens were positively associated 
with nonadherence.

Improving data sharing on a European level
on different technologies and have specific data structure 
designs. However, these issues can be overcome by imple-
menting data translation layers toward a common structure, 
in order to exploit the potential that current advances in 
technology could provide.
 Despite complexity, combining databases from dif-
ferent countries, although a challenging task, is possible. 
Combining databases from multiple countries exploiting 
common structural elements will help increasing the 
cohorts both on numerical and geographical coverage 
aspects. To allow this, infrastructures should allow for data 
identification, query of data, merging data from different 
sources, and transference of data following security and pri-
vacy guidelines. They should deal with different databases 
located across different countries and allow access to third 
countries. They should also grant integrity and security of 
the data transferred, allow to run cross-queries across dif-
ferent databases, and inform about the precedence of the 
data provided as results. In order to enable secondary use 
of health care data and bridge the gap between clinical and 
research domains, several initiatives have been carried out. 
Patient care and research need and use different data mod-
els. Accordingly, CDE models have been developed, such 
as C154 – Data Dictionary Component, the Federal Health 
Information Model, and the domain analysis model.20–23 
Another useful approach aims to define both CDEs and 
accompanying data models. An example is Informatics 
for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) designed 
for cohort identification. Many of the queries asked in a 
registry are essentially forms of cohort identification (eg, 
how many patients are on medication X, how many are 
adhering to evidence-based guideline Y). In addition, build-
ing registries on top of i2b2 removes the need to either: 
1) load the data into multiple database systems or 2) have 
users manually reenter the relevant electronic medical 
record data. By building research registries using i2b2, 
users can add data that are not collected in the electronic 
medical record.24
Our study indicated that the databases considered are 
already being used for analysis in the field of multimorbidity, 
adherence to medication, and polypharmacy. Although most 
of these studies are still ongoing, preliminary results suggest

nonadherence is more prevalent among younger people. 
Furthermore, comorbidity and complexity of drug regimens 
are positively associated with nonadherence. These results 
should be extended in different contexts and European coun-
tries, supporting the idea that large European studies should

Improving data sharing on a European level
require more representative populations, longer follow-up 
periods, and a greater range of patient data.25 These kinds of 
findings may be highly relevant when planning initiatives to 
increase adherence by more focused interventions.
European studies combining data from 
multiple data sources
A recent survey carried out by the European Network of 
Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance 
highlighted that multinational studies combining data from 
multiple sources have been encouraged over the recent 
years by funding calls of the European Commission such 
as Seventh Framework Programme, Horizon 2020 program, 
and the Innovative Medicines Initiative. Approximately 18 
projects have been totally or partially publicly funded by the 
European Commission in the years 2008–2013, although the 
majority of them are focused on drug safety. The methodol-
ogy used to combine data from multiple databases has been 
heterogeneous.26 Among these projects, some examples are 
Exploring and Understanding Adverse Drug Reactions by 
Integrative Mining of Clinical Records and Biomedical 
Knowledge (EU-ADR)27 and Pharmacoepidemiological 
Research on Outcomes of Therapeutics (PROTECT).28 
The EU-ADR project aims to design, develop, and validate 
a computerized integrative system for early detection of 
adverse drug reactions. This collaborative framework uses 
data extracted from eight European health records databases 
from four countries (Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, and 
Denmark) and comprises data of >30 million patients. The 
resulting platform was used to run specific web services 
and workflows and combine obtained evidence to consti-
tuting an effective tool to help research work in pharma-
covigilance.29,30 The PROTECT project aims to strengthen 
the monitoring of the benefit–risk of medicines in Europe, 
which consists of 34 public and private partners coordinated 
by the European Medicines Agency. In this project, a 
methodological framework for pharmacoepidemiological 
studies for signal detection and evaluation in various types 
of datasets was developed and tested.31 Another example is 
Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe proj-
ect, a multidisciplinary and cross-national panel database 
of micro data on health, social and family network, and 
socioeconomic status of those aged ≥50 years32,33 from 20 
European countries (+Israel; Table 3).
In addition to these initiatives, the European Commission 
and the WHO Regional Office for Europe agreed in 2010 
to strengthen cooperation in order to work toward a single 
information system for health in Europe, building on existing 
cooperation and also expanding the use of shared data collec-
tion, collaborative analyses of health issues, and generation 
and dissemination of knowledge in support of health policy. 
The report “Promoting better integration of health informa-
tion systems: best practices and challenges” published in 
2015 addresses the current trends in the member states of the 
EU and European Free Trade Association on how to promote 
better integration of health information systems. To under-
stand what better integration means from a pragmatic per-
spective, the Health Evidence Network conducted interviews 
with experts from 13 member states of the EU, the results 
of which were combined with the findings from a literature 
search. The results from the interviews stress the need 1) for 
ongoing work on some “basics”, such as data availability and 
quality, inventories of data and registries, standardization, 
legislation, physical infrastructure, and workforce capaci-
ties; 2) to continue with the work on more “concept-driven” 
indicator sets; 3) to define what better integration means and 
to demonstrate concrete benefits of integration; 4) to build 
leadership for capacity building in further integration of 
health information systems; and 5) for a further international 
exchange about ongoing activities in this area.34

Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first initiative carried out at the 
European level to identify and compare health databases to 
study adherence to medical plans. To this end, the EIP on 
AHA initiative represents a unique opportunity to compare 
practices, identify common needs and gaps, and establish 
good practices and harmonized approaches with a view to 
maximize the effective exploitation of large data sets and 
provide the basis for studying population cohorts at the 
European level. It is important to note that data sharing 
could be performed at different levels of granularity. When 
data are shared at the single patient level, a key feature of 
an effective anonymization strategy is that it should be 
univocal, so that a patient receives the same anonymous 
ID each time his personal ID is being anonymized. This 
approach guarantees the possibility of tracking the same 
person through different data sources at the single country 
level (Figure 2).
At the same time, the anonymization technique must 
comply with the policies and constraints defined in national 
and international legislation and guidelines. Although many of 
these norms were developed in response to very different his-
torical conditions, including technologies that have now been 
superseded, they have to be kept into account.35 Furthermore, 
governance and ethical principles could have an important 
role in defining additional constraints on the type of approach 
used for anonymization. These in turn may influence if and 
how a database can be used in the study of multiple databases.
At the moment, there is no gold standard to perform 
multiple health care database integration among different 
countries and different health systems. One of the challenges 
in the fields of health services research is to promote the 
change from a fragmented to a harmonized approach defin-
ing sets of minimum data elements and agreed methods of 
and tools for harmonization and integration of data. In this 
sense, our study represented an effort to match EIP on AHA 
objectives of integration and harmonization in the field of 
large health-related databases.
By aggregating data from heterogeneous data sources 
and from large numbers of patients, the application of 
specific big data methodologies in the domain of clinical 
medicine and public health fulfils the goal of facilitating 
innovation, carrying out evidence-based research more 
efficiently and serving as the foundation for a more adaptive 
health care system.
This article analyzed a limited number of databases, those 
available by the members of EIP on AHA Adherence Action 
Group. They are distributed on the EU territory and represent 
a cluster of data from three different countries (Italy, Spain, 
and the Republic of Ireland). However, the methodology used 
to obtain information and characterize these databases can 
be easily expanded to other interested stakeholders for future 
data integration. It is important to highlight that, at the cur-
rent stage, this article aims to suggest a general framework to 
gather information necessary for health database integration, 
although some specificities may not be modeled by the current 
version of the survey employed. However, these features can be 
described by textual notes or by additional fields. This article 
did not treat legal and ethical aspects, since the focus of this 
work was on the technical and semantic feasibilities of interop-
erable databases from different countries and  
information at 
the individual level was out of the scope of this work.
Future steps
However, the sharing processes pose many significant chal-
lenges such as ensuring interoperability both at a technical 
and semantic level. The first step to take in order to create 
such systems is the definition of a minimum dataset and to 
identify data gaps for sharing information at the European 
level. The next step will include the development of sharing 
models complying with ethical and legal constraints such as 
privacy policies and country-specific laws.

Improving data sharing on a European level
systematic data gathering and integration at cross-national 
levels capable of providing support to both researchers and 
policy makers. In the framework of the EIP on AHA, our 
study represents the first step toward an approach for inte-
gration and harmonization of large health-related databases, 
with the final goal to create a structure capable of supporting 
multicountry health care research projects.
