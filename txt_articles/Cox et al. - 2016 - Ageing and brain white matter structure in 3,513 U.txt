Quantifying the microstructural properties of the human brain’s connections is necessary for
understanding normal ageing and disease. Here we examine brain white matter magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data in 3,513 generally healthy people aged 44.64–77.12 years from
the UK Biobank. Using conventional water diffusion measures and newer, rarely studied
indices from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, we document large age
associations with white matter microstructure. Mean diffusivity is the most age-sensitive
measure, with negative age associations strongest in the thalamic radiation and association
fibres. White matter microstructure across brain tracts becomes increasingly correlated in
older age. This may reflect an age-related aggregation of systemic detrimental effects. We
report several other novel results, including age associations with hemisphere and sex, and
comparative volumetric MRI analyses. Results from this unusually large, single-scanner
sample provide one of the most extensive characterizations of age associations with major
white matter tracts in the human brain.

ully understanding brain ageing requires an accurate
characterization of how and where white matter micro-
structure varies with age. White matter is highly relevant to
ageing: later-life cognitive decline may partly be caused by cortical
disconnection, a microstructural deterioration of the brain’s
connective pathways through processes such as axonal demyeli-
nation that reduces information transfer efficiency1–3. The
concept of disconnection has in large part been supported by
analyses of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), a
non-invasive, quantitative method that exploits the Brownian
motion of water molecules, allowing inferences to be made about
the underlying microstructure of brain white matter in vivo4–6.
Past findings have been inconsistent in their characterization of
the trajectory and spatial distribution of age effects across brain
white matter tracts and of associations with hemisphere and
biological sex2,7–23. A statistically well-powered study of age
associations with white matter microstructure, in particular in
middle-aged and older age groups (45 þ years), would address
these gaps in our understanding. In addition to conventional
measures of fractional anisotropy (FA; the directional coherence
of water molecule diffusion) and mean diffusivity (MD; the
magnitude of water molecule diffusion), newer and rarely studied
neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)24
measures offer new information on the microstructural bases of
age effects on white matter25. NODDI provides estimates of
neurite density (intra-cellular volume fraction; ICVF), extra-
cellular water diffusion (isotropic volume fraction; ISOVF) and
tract complexity/fanning (OD). The observed mean decline of FA
in older age could be affected by, among other factors5, decreases
in the density and/or an increase in the dispersion orientation of
neurites (dendrites and axons); FA is unable to differentiate
between these possibilities26. Thus, NODDI may offer a novel
mechanistic insight into white matter ageing. However, a
comprehensive examination of NODDI parameters has not
been undertaken in the context of older age and has not been
attempted alongside more commonly used water diffusion
parameters.
The diffusion properties of white matter tracts across the brain
are correlated; for example, an individual with relatively high FA
in one tract is likely to also have relatively high FA across other
tracts in the brain. This means that a latent, general factor of
white matter microstructure can be derived16,27. Analysis of
latent factors allows a deeper understanding of the covariance
structure of inter-individual differences in age-related brain
changes; measuring global white matter diffusion is of great
interest
for
investigating
ageing
trends
that
are
general
across
white
matter
tracts
(but
specific
to
white
matter
tissue)10,11,14,21,28. Isolated, tract-specific enquiry cannot distin-
guish whether ageing patterns are unique to that tract or an
outcome of a more systemic constellation of processes. Tract-
specific enquiry is also susceptible to a large degree of noise in the
diffusion signal29; this noise can be reduced by using multivariate,
latent-variable analyses13.
An additional gap in our understanding relates to the
de-differentiation hypothesis: the suggestion that interindividual
differences in microstructure across tracts become increasingly
related in older age30–32. This hypothesis stems from a common-
cause theory of ageing-related neurodegeneration33. It posits that
system-wide breakdown of physiological function shifts overall
levels of integrity across brain regions for affected individuals.
Given that these sources of variance are shared across brain tracts,
the signature should be higher correlations among regionally
distributed neuronal measures with age. Here we seek evidence
for white matter structural de-differentiation from middle to
older age, which could be an important marker of an aggregation
of deleterious effects operating on white matter connections
distributed across the central nervous system.
We undertook an analysis of age associations in 27 major white
matter tracts (Fig. 1). The data were from the UK Biobank
resource (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk). We examined the tract-
specific differences according to age, sex and hemisphere. We
conducted analyses across all five water diffusion measures
discussed above (FA, MD, ICVF, ISOVF and OD) along with
supplementary analyses of axial (lax) and radial diffusivity

 (lrad), and diffusion tensor mode (MO), characterizing which
biomarker and which tract was most age-sensitive. We investi-
gated whether tracts’ diffusion characteristics were more strongly
correlated in older individuals (testing brain microstructural
de-differentiation).
This study provides the most definitive characterisation to-date
of age associations with the brain s white matter from middle to
older age. We identified MD as the diffusion parameter most
sensitive to age and, although sex differences exist, neither sex
appeared to exhibit stronger age effects. Tract-specific associa-
tions with age were strongest in thalamic and association
pathways, and weakest in projection fibres. We also show that
there are tract-specific and white-matter-wide correlations with
age. Finally, we found novel evidence for brain microstructural
de-differentiation for FA, MD, ICVF and ISOVF.
Results
Tract characteristics. Characteristics of the 3,513 participants
and a recruitment flowchart are reported in Supplementary
Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1. The current sample—the first
release of the UK Biobank MRI sample—is a group of generally
healthy middle-aged and older adults (age range 44.64–77.12
years). Tract-averaged values for MR diffusion parameters FA,
MD, ICVF, ISOVF and OD in each brain pathway are displayed
in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. We
also report supplementary analyses of lax and lrad (both are of
interest in ageing research but are similar to MD), and MO,
which are each described in Methods. Tract-averaged values for
these parameters are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Table 3. Associations among the left and right
diffusion parameters are displayed in Supplementary Figs 4 and 5.

 Tract associations with age and hemisphere and sex. Older age
was significantly associated with lower coherence of water diffu-
sion (FA; bZ � 0.275), lower neurite density (ICVF; bZ � 0.382)
and lower tract complexity (OD; bZ � 0.277), and with a
higher magnitude of water diffusion (MD; br0.496) and ISOVF
(br0.343) across the majority of tracts (Figs 2–4 and Supple-
mentary Tables 4 and 5). These results indicate less healthy white
matter microstructure with older age. Both lax (br0.478) and
lrad (br0.468) showed comparable age associations to MD
across all tracts and MO was associated both positively and
negatively with age across tracts (b range � 0.129 to 0.212;
Supplementary Table 6). Associations were predominantly non-
linear with the exception of FA and MO (Figs 2–4 and
Supplementary Tables 4–6), indicating steepening slopes with
increasing age. Associations with age were particularly marked in
association (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior
longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), superior longitudinal fasciculus
(SLF) and Uncinate) and thalamic radiation (anterior thalamic
radiation (ATR), superior thalamic radiation (STR) and posterior
thalamic radiation (PTR)) fibres, as well as in the forceps minor
(FMin) (Fig. 5). In contrast, the cingulum and sensory projection
fibres showed modest or absent age associations across all
diffusion parameters. Differences in the magnitude of associations
with age between these thalamic and association fibres (IFOF,
ILF, SLF, Uncinate, ATR, STR and PTR) were consistently and
significantly greater than those for the cingulum bundles,
corticospinal tract (CST), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP),
medial lemniscus (ML), forceps major (FMaj), acoustic radiation
(AR; Williams’s one-sample t-values42.42, P-valueso0.015,
n43510) across FA, MD, ICVF and ISOVF, with the exception of
the cingulum bundle (gyrus) for ICVF. Among these specific
association and thalamic radiation fibres, MD exhibited the
strongest age associations of any of the diffusion parameters
(Williams’s
one-sample
t-values44.27,
P-valueso0.001,
n43,510; MD differences with lax and lrad not tested; Fig. 6).
In addition to differential tract associations with age, putatively
healthier microstructure was found for some measures in the left
versus right hemisphere, such as higher FA (bZ � 0.511), lower
ISOVF (br0.319) and lower MD (br0.175; Supplementary
Tables 4–6 and Fig. 5). Males also showed consistently higher
FA (br0.218). Females exhibited consistently greater OD
(bZ � 0.255). The interactions between age and sex—although
significant for some tracts (age � sex babsolute range ¼ 0.028–
0.079)—were small and inconsistent.

 General factors of white matter microstructure. We tested
whether there was evidence for latent factors explaining a
substantial portion of the variance in each of the five different
types of tract measurement. That is, we tested whether a given
microstructural measure was positively correlated among all
tracts across the brain and whether this common variance could
be indexed by a latent factor.
Within all white matter biomarkers (with the exception of
MO), the measurements from across all tracts correlated
positively; for instance, those with higher FA in one tract tended
to have higher FA in all their tracts (Fig. 7 and Supplementary
Figs 4 and 5). The MCP and the bilateral cingulum gyrus,
parahippocampal and ML tracts consistently covaried relatively
weakly with others; these were removed from further models. The
latent factors were thus indicated by 22 tracts each. For FA, MD,
ICVF and ISOVF, initial scree plots of the tract data (Fig. 8, left
panel) provided evidence for a strong single factor capturing
common variance across the tracts; this was less clear for OD,
which had a comparatively weaker first factor and a stronger
second factor than the other measures. Examination of scree plots
for lax, lrad and MO indicated similarly strong evidence for a
strong first factor for lax and lrad, but extremely weak evidence
for MO (Supplementary Fig. 6, left panel). As a consequence, a
factor score for MO was not extracted and analysed further.
Across the age range, the first factor accounted for a mean of
41.4% of total variance in FA, 38.1% in MD, 29.8% in lax, 39.6%
in lrad, 68.2% in ICVF, 30.8% in ISOVF and 20.1% in OD.
Results presented below are therefore based on single factor
models of each of these diffusion measures. Henceforth, the prefix
g denotes these latent factors (for example, the general FA factor
is denoted gFA). Fit statistics, factor loadings and residual
covariance paths are shown in Supplementary Tables 7–9.
Age associations in the latent factors are illustrated in Fig. 8
(central panel and Supplementary Fig. 6 for glax and glrad). As
expected from the individual-tract data discussed above, gFA,
gICVF and gOD factors were lower in older age. gFA and gICVF
showed relatively linear declines, and gOD showed decline
after approximately age 60 years. gMD, glax, glrad and
gISOVF showed substantial increases from 45 years of age. The
standardized effect sizes for age were gFA: b ¼ � 0.254, gMD:
b ¼ 0.368,
gICVF:
b ¼ � 0.265,
gISOVF:
b ¼ 0.273,
gOD:
b ¼ � 0.120, glax: b ¼ 0.341 and glrad: b ¼ 0.363 (Supple-
mentary Table 10). Age had a significantly stronger association
with gMD than with any of the other latent factors (all Williams’s
t-values45.55, all P-valueso0.0001, all n43,510; lax and lrad
not tested).
We next examined the extent to which the effect of age on
white matter is common to all tracts, or tract-specific. We tested
whether
age
associations
with
the
individual
tracts
were
accounted for by the association between age and the general
factor (a common pathway), or whether there were incremental
tract-specific age associations (common plus independent path-
ways). For all latent white matter microstructural measurements,
there was evidence of age being associated with the general factor.
There were also additional tract-specific effects, that is, common
plus independent pathway models fit significantly better than
models that only included a common pathway of age associations
(Supplementary Table 11). In summary, age appears to affect the
white matter both overall and in some additional, specific tracts
(Supplementary Fig. 7).

 The FA signal is susceptible to microstructural properties in
the brain that include neurite density and tract complexity/
fanning. The availability of the NODDI variables ICVF and OD
allow us to directly test whether and how ICVF and OD mediate
the association between increasing age and lower FA. We used
estimates of the general factor scores in a multiple-mediator
analysis. Our results (Supplementary Table 12 and Supple-
mentary Fig. 8) showed that the linear association between age
and gFA was significantly mediated by 75.71% (from b ¼ � 0.247
to b ¼ � 0.060) with the inclusion of the NODDI parameters.
The majority of this mediation took place through gICVF rather
than gOD. This suggests that age-related declines in brain white
matter FA may predominantly be explained by declines in neurite
density rather than changes in tract complexity.
Next, we aimed to contextualize the utility of all five (FA, MD,
ICVF, ISOVF and OD) white matter tract diffusion parameters’
general factors in a reverse inference exercise, examining how
much age variation they could explain beyond conventional brain
volumetric measures in the same participants (total brain, grey
matter,
white
matter,
hippocampal
and
thalamic
volumes;
corrected for head size). Increasing age was associated with lower
volumes in each of these measures (Supplementary Table 13 and
Supplementary Fig. 9). Given the high collinearity of all volumetric
and diffusion indices (Supplementary Table 14), we employed a
penalized (elastic net) regression to identify an optimal set of
predictors of chronological age in one half of the randomly and
equally split sample (training set). glax and glrad were virtually
identical to gMD and were not included.

 The results showed that age-related variance in specific aspects
of white matter microstructure (FA, MD and ISOVF) is partially
independent of atrophy and grey matter volume. Of the five white
matter microstructural measures and five volumetric measures,
gFA, gMD, gISOVF, total brain volume and grey matter volume
appeared in more than 60% of the 1,000 bootstrapped models on
the training set. These predictors were entered into a multiple
linear regression in the training set (n ¼ 1,756), followed
by a confirmatory test using the same predictors in the
testing set (n ¼ 1,757; Supplementary Table 15). In both cases,

 measures) were uniquely informative of age, beyond general brain
atrophy (total brain volume, corrected for head size). Results
(shown in Supplementary Table 16) indicated that, in isolation,
thalamic volume and gTR each significantly explained unique
portions of age variance (R2 for Thalamus þ gTR FA ¼ 0.129:
Thalamus þ gTR MD ¼ 0.265; Thalamus þ gTR ICVF ¼ 0.175;
Thalamus þ gTR ISOVF ¼ 0.218; Thalamus þ gTR OD ¼ 0.224).
When total brain volume corrected for head size was included in
the model, both thalamic volume (babsoluter0.242) and gTR for
each diffusion parameter (babsoluter0.229) remained significant.
Age de-differentiation of white matter microstructure. Do
white matter tracts tend to lose their individuality in older age?
We tested the de-differentiation hypothesis that microstructural
properties of white matter tracts across the brain become more
similar at later ages. A series of heatmaps (Fig. 7) illustrate the
increasing relatedness of white matter tract microstructure across
six age groups with B5 year intervals. Qualitatively stronger
associations among tracts with increasing age were evident for
FA, MD, ICVF and ISOVF, but not for OD. To quantify this
more formally, we extended each of the general factor models to
include an interaction parameter representing age moderation of
the shared variance across the 22 tracts and an interaction
parameter representing age moderation of the tract-specific
unique variance. In other words, we estimated two interaction
parameters for each of the diffusion measures. This allowed us,
for each diffusion measure, to calculate the mean communality
(the proportion of total variance that was shared) across tracts as
a continuous function of age.
For six of the diffusion measures, the latent factor accounted
for more variance in older age (Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 6,
right panel). For FA, the factor explained 11.5% more variance in
the oldest participants (around age 75) than in the youngest
participants (around age 45). The equivalent differences were
18.1% for MD, 11.8 for lax, 18.3% for lrad, 7.2% for ICVF and
12.9% for ISOVF. There was no appreciable age difference in the
first factor of OD with age (there was a small, nonsignificant
decline in explained variance of � 0.7%); we saw above that OD
also evinced the weakest general factor overall. In summary, for
six of the biomarkers, there was greater generality across the
tracts
with
greater
age,
providing
clear
evidence
of
age-related de-differentiation. The older the brain, the more
likely it will be that—within a given individual—one tract will
share a microstructural quality with of all of the brain’s other
white matter tracts. A dynamic illustration of white matter tract
de-differentiation (using MD as an exemplar) can be seen in
Supplementary Movie 1.
Finally, we evaluated whether the overall pattern of increasing
tract communality with age was driven by particular subsets of
the tracts. These analyses (Supplementary Tables 17–20 and
Supplementary Figs 10–16) revealed that much of the upward
mean trend in tract generality (for all measures except OD)
shown in Fig. 8 was driven by steeper trends in the communalities
of the association fibres and thalamic radiations—the same tracts
that showed the largest mean age relationships. The commun-
alities of the sensory projections (AR and CST) were flatter,
indicating that the variance in them explained by the general
factor was similar across the age range. Notably, some tracts (such
as the FMaj) showed age differences in the amounts of variance
explained at both the general and the specific level: that is, the
total amount of tract variance was higher in older age.
Overall, we found that, at older ages, there was a greater
tendency for all tracts in the brain to show similar levels of FA,
MD, lax, lrad, ICVF and ISOVF within individuals. The
increases in the tracts’ common variance were particularly
pronounced for the thalamic radiations and association fibres.
Therefore, it was not simply that age associations were largest
among these specific tracts, but that interindividual differences in
diffusion measures for these tracts covaried more strongly with
each other and with other tracts in the brain in older individuals.
Discussion
This study adds to our understanding of the white matter
microstructure of the brain in middle- and older-aged humans.
Older age was most strongly associated with less healthy white
matter in the thalamic radiations (ATR, PTR and STR) and
association fasciculi (ILF, IFOF, SLF and Uncinate). The
comparison of conventional dMRI and NODDI variables showed
that MD was the most sensitive parameter to age among these
tracts. Interindividual differences in each diffusion measure
showed a clear tendency to covary across white matter tracts.
General factors taken across the tracts captured substantial
variation in FA, MD, ICVF and ISOVF, and more modest
proportions of variation in OD. The general factors each had a
tendency towards less healthy values at older ages and we also
observed tract-specific age associations beyond those that could
be accounted for exclusively via general factors.
Mediation models indicated that the link between older age
and lower general FA (gFA) was predominantly driven by lower
neurite density (gICVF) rather than greater OD (gOD). In a
reverse inference exercise, we illustrated the importance of brain
diffusion parameters for understanding ageing: latent measures of
white matter diffusion (FA, MD and ISOVF, in particular)
provided unique information about age, beyond conventional
volumetric brain measures of global atrophy, hippocampal, grey
and white matter volume. We also showed that both the thalamic
radiations and the volume of the thalamus itself are uniquely
informative for age variance, beyond general atrophy. Finally, the
tendency for white matter tracts within individuals to share
microstructural
qualities
(assessed
using
water
diffusion
characteristics) was stronger in older participants, indicating
de-differentiation of brain connectivity. This tendency was most
strongly driven by the greater relatedness among the same
thalamic radiation and association fasciculi that showed the
greatest age associations in our tract-specific analyses.
The apparent differential age trends—both heterochronicity
and spatial heterogeneity—across the tracts is supportive of the
last in, first out hypothesis34, whereby the tracts that are latest to
develop are the most vulnerable to the deleterious effects of
ageing. In particular, post-mortem and dMRI studies indicate
ontogenetic differences between early-myelinating projection and
posterior callosal fibres, and the later-developing association
pathways12,21,22,35. An underlying reason for this pattern may be
that the pathways latest to develop are more thinly myelinated,
and that the oligodendrocytes responsible for their myelination
are more vulnerable to aggregating deleterious effects due to their
comparatively elevated metabolic activity2,17. We found that this
pattern also occurs for more rarely studied water molecule
diffusion measures (ICVF and ISOVF). Thus, these spatially
distinct relations with age are apparent across a wider range of
microstructural properties than was previously thought.
Our finding that the strongest age associations were with the
thalamic radiations does not however follow the reported
ontogeny in childhood. Whereas the anterior limb of the internal
capsule (which contains, among other fibres, the ATR) shows a
relatively delayed maturational trajectory, the posterior limb of
the internal capsule (which contains, among other fibres, the
PTR) shows comparatively early development along with the
cortisospinal tract, ARs and MCP36,37, yet the PTR showed some
of the most marked age effects in this sample. However, the initial
supposition of last in, first out referred to both ontogenetic and

 phylogenetic chronology34; the thalamic nuclei are likely to have
undergone considerable evolutionary modification, perhaps to
keep pace with the rapidly expanding cortex38. The complex set
of nuclei that comprise the thalamus share connections across the
whole cortex, including hippocampal and prefrontal pathways,
forming a densely interconnected processing unit39–41, which
may be highly relevant to its metabolic activity. The current study
highlights the potential importance of the anterior, superior and
PTRs (along with the complementary measure of the volume of
the thalamus itself) and association fibres for understanding brain
ageing; these tracts could be the foci of future investigations into
behavioural outcomes and possible determinants.
Associations between each microstructural measure and age
were generally in the expected direction, adding considerable
confidence to the magnitude and (non-)linearity of prior
estimates of decreasing FA, ICVF along with increasing MD,
lax, lrad and ISOVF from middle to older age across voxel-wise,
region of interest and tract-based approaches7,8,12,20–22,24,35,42.
Although our data do not cover childhood and earlier adulthood,
the linear trajectories of FA reported here fit with prior evidence
that FA declines with age may begin well before age 45 years, with
MD relatively preserved until this age9,12,21. However, the
negative association between age and gOD were not in line
with some prior research25,42, which found that increasing age
was associated with increasing OD. The apparent discrepancy
between studies might be ascribed to the following factors. We
reported that gOD encapsulated less tract-wide variance than
other general factors, reflected in the range of both positive and
negative associations with age at the level of specific tracts. Thus,
comparability with prior observations should be considered in
light of the specific tracts considered. Moreover, our analysis
showed that OD generally described a nonlinear increase until
around 60 years, followed by a decrease (in some tracts more than
others). Previous studies that did report an age-related increase in
OD studied younger participants than in the current sample
(r63 years25,42), whereas a negative relationship, or a similar
quadratic shift from positive to negative at B60 years, was found
when studying older participants43,44. All studies were also
conducted using relatively small sample sizes (range n ¼ 47–116).
These results further emphasize the value of the current data, in
which older participants are well-represented.
Age-related differences in white matter diffusion measures
were not simply reflective of gross volumetric brain indices in our
sample. All diffusion and volumetric measures were, in isolation,
associated with age, but our analysis identified that grey matter
volume, total brain volume and gISOVF, gFA and gMD were
significant predictors (together explaining B40% of the variance
in age), whereas white matter volume, hippocampal volume,
gICVF and gOD were not. The result that information about
white matter water diffusion from both NODDI and more
conventional measures is more informative for age than white
matter volume might indicate that these biomarkers are more
sensitive to subtle age-related differences in white matter.
However, it is important to note that a global white matter
measure can be divided into normal-appearing and white-matter
hyperintensity volume in older subjects45. The latter, a marker of
white matter disease45, appears to progress independently of grey
matter changes46, but was not derived in the current data set. It
may be that the insensitivity of total white matter volume to the
important ratio of normal-appearing:white-matter hyperintensity
volume may partly account for its lack of predictive value in
our models. In addition, the current investigation focussed on
specific pathways, therefore excluding peripheral white matter
microstructure, which may also prove to be of particular interest
to the brain and cognitive ageing47. The use of whole tract-
averaged
measures
also
assumes
that
the water
diffusion
parameters are broadly equivalent throughout each tract of
interest. Although this may be true for MD, FA reportedly
exhibits local (within-tract) variability and larger differences
between young and older participants (group nE50) than MD22.
Although another study reported that voxel-wise and tract-based
analyses of white matter diffusion (including NODDI measures)
showed concordant age associations42, it is possible that methods
such
as
tract-based
spatial
statistics
(TBSS)
may
provide
additional insight into locus-specific age effects within tracts
(see refs 15,21), albeit in more limited portions of cerebral white
matter.
The participants in the current study were in relative good
health; we excluded individuals with any known neurodegenera-
tive disease. Whereas there is evidence that MD is also more
sensitive to age than FA among those with mild stroke48, our
sample composition has implications for another aspect of our
results. Whereas hippocampal volume and ICVF did not appear
to provide unique information about age in this sample, both
ICVF (rather than FA)49 and hippocampal volume50 are
important dementia biomarkers, emphasizing that our findings,
which focus on normal ageing, cannot necessarily be generalized
to clinical populations.
From each of the five white matter parameters, we extracted
latent general factors to be extracted from the covariances among
22 white matter tracts. These factors indexed from 20 to 68% of
the variance across the tracts, highlighting their importance—but
not exclusivity—for providing indices of overall brain micro-
structure. The fit of these models was improved by adding
correlated residual paths beforehand and we removed three fibre
pathways for having low factor loadings. Thus, these are not the
only factors that were extractable from the data: smaller, weaker
factors may also exist that index appreciable portions of cross-
tract variance16. Consequently, whereas we show that the
association between age and gFA was predominantly attenuated
by gICVF rather than gOD, we note that the latter did not exhibit
such a strong first factor and therefore it is possible that our
estimate of the amount that gOD contributes to the age-gFA
relation might fluctuate more as a function of tract than it might
for gICVF.
In our analysis of de-differentiation in the brain, we found
compelling evidence—in four of the five white matter micro-
structural measurements (all except OD)—for increasing tract
generality with age. For each of these four microstructural
properties, the covariation across tracts within the brain was
higher with greater age. One explanation of this de-differentiation
is that the ageing of white matter structure involves an
aggregation of systemic, detrimental effects that render tract-
specific variation in white matter (dis)connectivity less prominent
at older ages. Uncovering the specific cellular and metabolic
mechanisms that might cause this increasing generality and how
this generality might shed light on the brain basis for cognitive
and functional ageing should be investigated in future studies.
The large sample size provided crucial improvements in statistical
power over previous studies. Based on our power calculations,
even with a sample size of 1,000, we would have mischaracterized
the vast majority of tract–age associations as linear, the modest
age � sex interactions as null and, most importantly, we would
most probably have lacked the precision to differentiate the
various parameters’ sensitivity to age and to accurately quantify
the magnitude of white matter dedifferentiation.
Further to limitations of our sample composition and the brain
MRI and statistical analyses discussed above, cross-sectional
estimates of age-related trajectories may imperfectly index
patterns of within-person changes over time51. They are also
subject to bias due to cohort differences and secular trends in the
brain structure. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies remain rare

 and the time course required to test healthy participants
prospectively across a comparable age span is prohibitive,
leading many to adopt semi-longitudinal designs across large
age ranges8,10,16,23,52,53, with comparatively smaller samples
across a wide age range, or adopt full longitudinal designs in
cohorts with a narrow age range54. Thus, although the current
cross-sectional
data
provide
a
well-powered
insight
into
differences
in
white
matter
microstructure
with
age,
examination of intra-individual change awaits further data.
Fully longitudinal studies in larger, wide-age-span samples
would be required to track individual trajectories directly,
although coverage of a comparable time span to the current
study would take many years.
A final limitation pertains to the quality and validity of the
water diffusion data. Despite the quality checks on the data
conducted both by the UK Biobank imaging team and our own
group, we cannot rule out the role of partial volume effects—
such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contamination—on the results
reported here. Prior reports indicate that MD may be more
susceptible to CSF contamination than FA and that this may
affect some tracts more than others12,55. Thus, it is possible that
MD’s apparently greater sensitivity to age than FA might be
driven by such effects. Whereas tract-averaged data corrected
for partial volume effects (using methods such as tract volume12
or free water elimination55) are currently unavailable from UK
Biobank, we note that gMD and gFA were comparably sensitive
to age in the context of other brain structural indices
(Supplementary Table 15). Although the relatively complex
parameterization
of
the
diffusion
signal
among
NODDI
measures
may
be
more
robust
to
such
effects,
the
neurobiological validation of these relatively newer parameters
(for example, see ref. 56) would benefit from further data. In
combination with the variety of cerebrostructural factors
that can influence water diffusion discussed above, direct
extrapolations of each water diffusion parameter to specific
microstructural properties should be made with caution.
This large-scale, single-scanner brain imaging sample has
afforded clear insights into the human brain’s connections in
middle to older age. In this study, we located and quantified the
age-related differences in white matter tracts; provided robust
information
about
which
diffusion-based
biomarkers
were
especially sensitive in ageing; demonstrated that the inter-
individual variation in specific tracts became less specific with
age; and found that ageing processes are best modelled as acting
on those characteristics that tracts share rather than those that are
unique to them. We found evidence to support age-related brain
disconnection1–3
in
later
life,
especially
in
thalamic
and
association tracts. In another sense, we found the older brain to
be
increasingly
connected,
because
its
tracts
lost
some
individuality with increasing age. These findings offer secure
foundations for planned further exploration of the risk factors
and mechanisms of brain and cognitive ageing.
Methods
Participants and ethical approval. The UK Biobank comprises B500,000
community-dwelling participants who were initially recruited from across Great
Britain between 2006 and 2010, aged 40–69 years (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).
An average of 4.15 (s.d. ¼ 0.91) years after initial recruitment, a subset of partici-
pants also underwent head MRI at mean age 61.72 (s.d. ¼ 7.47, range 44.64–77.12)
years. The initial release of brain dMRI data from 5,455 participants is the subject
of the current study. UK Biobank received ethical approval from the research ethics
committee (REC reference 11/NW/0382). The present analyses were conducted
under UK Biobank application number 10279. All participants provided informed
consent to participate. Further information on the consent procedure can be found
here (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=200).
Demographic information. Information on qualifications, ethnicity, sex
and handedness were reported during the initial UK Biobank assessment
(http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=100235). Educational qualifica-
tions (UK Biobank code: 6138) were taken from responses to the question:
‘Which of the following qualifications do you have? (You can select more than
one)’. Response options were as follows: College or University Degree/A levels
or AS levels or equivalent/CSEs or equivalent/NVQ or HND or HNC or equiva-
lent/Other professional qualifications, for example, nursing, teaching/None of the
above/Prefer not to answer. For the purposes of characterizing the participants
here, we collapsed the data into a binary variable, indicating whether or not each
participant held a college or university degree. Self-reported ethnic background
(UK Biobank code: 21000) was based on response to the question ‘What is your
ethnic group?’. Response options were as follows: White/Mixed/Asian or Asian
British/Black or Black British/Chinese/Other ethnic group/Do not know/Prefer not
to answer. These responses were collapsed into White, Mixed and Other. Hand-
edness (UK Biobank code: 1707) was based on responses to the question: ‘Are you
right or left handed’, where response options were as follows: Right-handed/
Left-handed/Use both right and left equally/Prefer not to answer. At the time
of the MRI assessment, participants’ medical history (UK Biobank code: 20002)
was taken and coded by a trained nurse according to a specific coding tree
(http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=20002). Those who reported a
diagnosis of dementia/Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment,
Parkinson’s disease, stroke, other chronic/degenerative neurological problem
or demyelinating condition (including multiple sclerosis and Guillain–Barre
´
syndrome) were removed from analysis.
MRI acquisition. Details of the image acquisition and processing are
freely-available on the UK Biobank website in the form of a Protocol
(http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=2367), Brain Imaging
Documentation (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=1977) and
in ref. 57. The resultant structural and water diffusion MRI parameters from these
processing pipelines were derived by the UK Biobank Imaging team and made
available as imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs). Briefly, all brain MRI data were
acquired on a single standard Siemens Skyra 3T scanner with a standard Siemens
32-channel RF receiver head coil, with the imaging matrix angled down by 16�
from the AC-PC line. The T1-weighted volumes were acquired in the sagittal plane
using a three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence at
a resolution of 1 � 1 � 1 mm, with a 208 � 256 � 256 field of view. The dMRI
protocol employed a spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence with 10 T2-weighted
(bE0 s mm � 2) baseline, 50 b ¼ 1,000 s mm � 2 and 50 b ¼ 2,000 s mm � 2
diffusion-weighted volumes acquired with 100 distinct diffusion-encoding
directions and three times multi-slice acquisition. The field of view was
104 � 104 mm, imaging matrix 52 � 52, 72 slices with slice thickness 2 mm, giving
2 mm isotropic voxels. The flowchart in Supplementary Fig. 1 illustrates the
numbers from initial MRI recruitment and attendance through to completion and
quality control procedures. Of the 5,455 who provided MRI data, 567 were
acquired at an earlier scanning phase (for which the resultant dMRI data are
incompatible with data acquired subsequently; see Section 2.10 of the Brain Ima-
ging Documentation). A further 1,314 participants were removed during dMRI
quality-control procedures by UK Biobank before data release, which was a
combination of manual and automated checking and also included the removal of
data badly affected by movement artefacts (as described in the UK Biobank Brain
Imaging Documentation). In addition to the 59 participants with self-reported
diagnosis of stroke, dementia, Parkinson’s disease or any other demyelinating or
neurodegenerative disorder, a further two participants with consistently extreme
outlying tract-averaged water diffusion biomarker values were removed listwise,
along with 35 individual extreme outlying data points (o0.001% of total data),
following visual inspection of the data by the authors, leaving a total of 3,513
participants for analysis in the current study. The current sample did not differ
from those not scanned with respect to age at initial recruitment (t ¼ 0.834,
P ¼ 0.405), but comprise a higher proportion of females (w2 ¼ 9.637, P ¼ 0.002).
The total numbers of available tracts are reported in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.
Diffusion MRI processing and tractography. FA and MD are commonly derived
variables, which describe the directional coherence and magnitude of water
molecule diffusion, respectively. Water molecules tend to diffuse with greater
directional coherence and lower magnitude when constrained by tightly packed
fibres (such as well-myelinated axons) and by cell membranes, microtubules and
other structures26. Thus, individual differences in FA and MD in brain white
matter reflect meaningful differences in underlying microstructure, borne out by
comparison with brain white matter post-mortem work4,5. Measures of tract-
averaged lax and lrad and MO were also available as IDPs from UK Biobank. The
former two measures are also parameters of interest to brain ageing (for example,
refs 8,10) but are similar in their derivation from the three main tensor eigenvalues:
MD is the mean of all three, whereas lax ¼ l1 and lrad is the mean of l2 and l3).
MO (also known as the mode of anisotropy) describes the third moment of the
tensor (a positive value denotes narrow tubular water diffusion, whereas a negative
number denotes planar water diffusion), although little work has been done to
examine MO in relation to ageing. Consequently, we also provide parallel analyses
of lax, lrad and MO in Supplementary Material.
Unlike standard diffusion tensor MRI, NODDI makes specific assumptions
about the way in which local microarchitecture affects the geometric diffusion

 of water and parameterizes the water diffusion signal according to one of three
geometrical models: free water diffusion (such as in CSF), restricted diffusion
caused by the presence of dendrite and axons bodies, and hindered diffusion
among cell bodies. The resultant indices describe the ICVF (a measure of neurite
density), ISOVF (a measure of extracellular water diffusion) and neurite OD
(the degree of fanning or angular variation in neurite orientation).
Gradient distortion correction was applied using tools developed
by the Freesurfer and Human Connectome Project groups, available at
https://github.com/Washington-University/Pipelines. The Eddy tool from FSL
(http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/EDDY) was then used to correct the data for
head motion and eddy currents. Next, within-voxel multi-fibre tract orientation
structure was modelled using BEDPOSTx followed by probabilistic tractography
(with crossing fibre modelling) using PROBTRACKx58–60. Automatic mapping of
the 27 major white matter tracts was conducted in standard space of each
participant using start/stop region of interest masks (implemented using the
AutoPtx plugin for FSL)61 to derive tract-averaged measures of FA and MD
for the following tracts of interest: MCP, FMaj, FMin and bilateral medial lemnisci,
CSTs, acoustic, anterior thalamic, posterior thalamic, STRs, superior, inferior
longitudinal and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, and both the cingulate gyrus and
parahippocampal portions of the cingulum bundle (Fig. 1 in the main document).
In addition, NODDI24 modelling of the dMRI data was conducted using the
AMICO tool (Accelerated Microstructure Imaging via Convex Optimization;
https://github.com/daducci/AMICO)62. Maps of ICVF, ISOVF and OD, registered
with the AutoPtx tract masks, allowed the calculation of tract-averaged values for
each parameter across all voxels pertaining to each tract of interest.
Volumetric MRI processing. Extraction of the brain was achieved by nonlinearly
warping the data to MNI152 space (FNIRT)63,64, with the brain mask then back-
transformed into native space. FAST65 was then used to segment the brain tissue
(in native space, to avoid noise due to interpolation) into the CSF, grey matter and
white matter (with total brain volume being the sum of grey and white matter
volume); bilateral hippocampal and thalamic volumes were derived using FIRST66.
All volumes were then adjusted for head size using a SIENAX-style analysis67.
This involves deriving a scaling factor from the normalization transform matrix
obtained from the affine registration of skull tissue between T1-weighted volume
and MNI152 space. The resultant scaling factor was then applied to the volumes of
interest for each participant.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using R v3.2.2
(Fire Safety) and MPlus v7.3 (ref. 68). The distribution of each white matter
tract diffusion measure was inspected and we found no large deviations from
normality. We briefly illustrate the advantage in precision that this large sample
affords, by conducting a comparison of the minimal detectable difference that can
be achieved between the current sample size and a smaller study. A study with
1,000 participants would have 80% power to detect a bivariate association at
a ¼ 0.05 if the true effect is bstandardized ¼ 0.088. In contrast, the present study
(n ¼ 3,513) has the same power to detect a bstandardized ¼ 0.047 (calculated using
G*Power version 3.0.10; http://www.gpower.hhu.de/en.html).
Handedness is sometimes reported in dMRI studies, under the assumption that
differences exist (for example, Bender et al.8). There were no substantive
differences in tract characteristics between left- and right-handed participants
(except for a trend for left-handers to have marginally higher FA
(t(378.53) ¼ 2.130, P ¼ 0.034, d ¼ 0.219) and lower OD (t(374.58) ¼ � 2.747,
P ¼ 0.006, d ¼ 0.141) in the FMin, lower OD in the left CST (t(378.19) ¼ � 2.446,
P ¼ 0.015, d ¼ 0.125) and higher OD in the right Uncinate (t(373.85) ¼ 2.297,
P ¼ 0.022, d ¼ 0.238). As a result, all analyses are reported across the entire group.
Initially, associations between FA and MD of specific tracts were modelled with
respect to age, sex and hemisphere using multiple regression. We also included an
age � sex interaction term to examine whether age-related trajectories differed for
men and women. Linear and quadratic models were compared and, where models
with an age2 term exhibited a significantly better fit (Po0.05), these results were
reported. Owing to the large number of comparisons, a threshold of Po0.001 was
used to denote significant effects within each model. The age and age2 components
of these models were illustrated for each tract and water diffusion parameter using
kernel density plots, to allow clearer visualization of data point overlap than is
possible with standard scatter plots with a sample of this size. Tests of the
difference between association magnitudes were conducted on the linear
component of tract measures, implemented using Williams’s t for dependent groups
with overlapping correlations (cocor.indep.groups.overlaps) as implemented in the
cocor R package (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cocor/cocor.pdf).
Confirmatory factor analysis was used to produce one-factor models for each of
the five white-matter microstructural measurements (FA, MD, ICVF, ISOVF and
OD). On the basis of the first model, for the measurement of FA, we excluded five
tracts that had low (o0.3) loadings on the general factor: the MCP and bilateral
ML, and parahippocampal cingulum. For consistency, we also removed these tracts
from the subsequent factor models. To improve the model fit for the subsequent
use of the factors and the subsequent models, we used the modification indices
option in the Mplus v7.3 package68 to add additional, residual covariances
(paths linking specific tracts to one another). Importantly, none of the results of the
study was substantially altered by dropping these residual covariances, or by
including the four tracts that were removed. All the models adjusted each tract for
sex, age and—for all measurements other than FA, for which the tracts did not
show many appreciable quadratic age curves—age2. Fit statistics for the factor
models are presented in Supplementary Table 5, standardized factor loadings are
provided in Supplementary Table 6 and a list of the residual covariances can be
found in Supplementary Table 7. Factor score estimates were extracted from these
models and used in further analyses, and the one-factor model provided the basis
for the age-moderation models described below.
We also used structural equation modelling to test whether the age variation in
the tracts was best represented as a common pathway model (where age has
associations with only the latent factor), an independent pathways model (where
age has associations with each of the individual tracts separately and not with the
latent factor) or a common þ independent pathways model (where age is associated
with the latent factor and also with some specific factors, as required)69. To
estimate the common þ independent pathway model, we first included a path from
age (which had been centred before inclusion in the model) to the latent factor,
then added those paths that produced statistically significant improvements in
model fit. For MD, ICVF, ISOVF and OD, we also included paths from age2
alongside every significant age path. We always considered the paths together; if the
age path was added, so was the age2 path. We then used model fit indices (w2-test,
Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion) to examine the
fit differences between the three models. Fit statistics are shown in Supplementary
Table 9. In all cases, the common pathways model was the worst fitting. For MD,
ICVF, ISOVF and OD, the common þ independent pathway model fit either
significantly better or no different to the independent pathway model; for FA, there
was some ambiguity, with Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) demonstrating
better fit for the common þ independent pathways model but Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) demonstrating poorer fit.
We examined the degree to which the effect of increasing age on generally lower
water diffusion coherence (FA) across tracts was attributable to lower neurite
density (ICVF) and/or the amount of tract complexity/fanning (OD) using a
multiple mediator model in a structural equation model framework70 in the lavaan
R package71. Age was set as the X (independent) variable, the factor score for FA
(gFA) was set as the Y (outcome) variable, with gICVF and gOD as two covarying
mediators (M). The degree to which the association between X and Y (known as
the c path) is attenuated by M (the c’ path) denotes the mediation effect72,73.
Tests of the relative explanatory power of the factor scores of all five water
diffusion parameters to account for age variance—beyond measures more
conventionally associated with ageing (total brain, grey matter, white matter and
bilateral hippocampal volumes)—was achieved using penalised (elastic net)
regression74 bootstrapped 1,000 times. This method allowed us to identify an
optimal combination of predictors from among a group of highly collinear
variables. We randomly split the participants into two equal halves (Train and
Test). The optimal predictor set was identified by running penalized elastic net
regression in the Train group, selecting only those measures that were identified in
the majority (460%) of models. A multiple linear regression was then conducted
in the Train set and a confirmatory multiple linear regression in the Test set. In
general, if the model b and R2 are comparable, the combination of identified
predictors are considered optimal for the whole sample.
A posteriori, we also examined the relative contribution of the volume of the
thalamus and the microstructure of its radiations (gTR; the first unrotated solution of
a principal components analysis of the anterior, superior and PTRs) to age variance,
beyond global atrophy (total brain volume, corrected for head size). We did so by
running two sets of multiple regressions with age as the outcome variable. In the first,
the volume of the thalamus and gTR for each of FA, MD, ICVF, ISOVF and OD
were covariates. In the second, we added total brain volume corrected for head size,
to ascertain whether these main effects were simply reflective of global atrophy.
White matter tract de-differentiation was initially explored by visualizing
whether the strength of cross-tract associations altered across age groups for FA,
MD, ICVF, ISOVF and OD separately for all tracts. Six age groups were created
with B5 year intervals. These were: 44.64–49.98 years (n ¼ 290, M ¼ 48.23,
s.d. ¼ 1.16); 50.05–54.99 years (n ¼ 505, M ¼ 52.61, s.d. ¼ 1.43); 55.00–60.00 years
(n ¼ 559, M ¼ 57.57, s.d. ¼ 1.50); 60.01–65.00 years (n ¼ 800, M ¼ 62.57,
s.d. ¼ 1.45); 65.00–70.00 years (n ¼ 876, M ¼ 67.38, s.d. ¼ 1.38); 70.00–77.12
(n ¼ 483, M ¼ 72.45, s.d. ¼ 1.72). To more formally quantify this effect, age
moderation models were estimated separately for each of the white matter
microstructural measurements (that is, five models, one for each of FA, MD, ICVF,
ISOVF and OD). The age-moderation models included all of the residual
covariances that were added to the one-factor models as described above. In the
first set of models, we extended each of the five general factor models to include an
interaction parameter representing age moderation of the shared variance across
the 22 tracts and an interaction parameter representing age moderation of the
tract-specific unique variance components. In other words, we estimated two
interaction parameters for each of the five diffusion measures. This model can be
written for diffusion measure Y in tract t as:

where u[t] is a tract-specific regression intercept; a1[t], a2[t] and a3[t] are
tract-specific regression coefficients for the effects of age, age2 (not included for
FA) and sex; l1[t] is a tract-specific loading (main effect) on the general factor (gY);

 l2[t] is a tract-specific loading (main effect) on the tract-specific unique factor
(uY[t]); and l10 and l20 are tract-invariant interaction parameters representing
moderation of the loadings on the general factor and the tract-specific unique
factors, respectively. The subscript n indicates that a variable varies across
individuals. In the above equation, the interaction terms are multiplied by the
tract-specific loading in addition to the corresponding latent factor, to specify age
moderation to occur proportionally to the magnitude of the tract-specific loadings
(see Cheung et al.75).
We calculated communality values (proportion of variance explained by the
general factor relative to total variance (variance explained by the general factor
plus residual variance)76, Appendix B) and their s.e. for 5-year increments of the
sample’s age range (that is, for ages 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 and 75 years). Next, using
cubic polynomial interpolation, we calculated the expected values at all other ages
between 45 and 75 along with their s.e. and converted these into the age trajectories
with 95% confidence intervals shown in Fig. 8 in the main document.
To evaluate whether the overall pattern of increasing communality with age was
driven by smaller subset of the tracts, we estimated more complex models that
estimated tract-specific interaction parameters representing age moderation of
loadings on the general factor and tract-specific interaction parameters
representing age moderation of tract-specific uniquenesses77. In other words, we
estimated 44 interaction parameters (1 interaction for the loading on the general
factor and 1 interaction for the unique component, for each of the 22 tracts) for
each of the 5 diffusion measures (FA, MD, ICVF, ISOVF and OD). This model can
be written as

where the interaction terms l10 and l20 are estimated individually for each tract, as
indicated by the suffix [t]. As interaction terms are estimated individually for each
tract, the proportionality constraint (achieved in equation (1) via multiplication by
the tract-specific loading) is not necessary.
Within the de-differentiation models, we tested whether the age moderation for
each loading and each uniqueness was statistically significantly different from zero
(that is, whether the parameters l10 and l20 differed significantly with age).
The results of these tests are provided in Supplementary Tables 14 and 15 for
loadings and uniquenesses, respectively. To calculate the communality for each
tract (that is, the proportion of the total variance in that tract explained by the
factor), we divided the age-specific shared variance in that tract by the age-specific
shared-plus-unique (that is, total) variance in that tract76 (Appendix B), resulting
in the age trend for the communalities shown in the right panels of Supplementary
Figs 10–16.
Finally, local structural equation modelling78,79 was used to provide a non-
parametric confirmation of the multi-parameter models described above. Using
batch running of Mplus models80, we ran 300 one-factor models for each diffusion
measure, each aimed at a different part of the age range (300 equal increments
between 45 and 75 years). From the outputs of these models, we plotted the factor
loadings and uniquenesses as a function of age, for each tract. Again, we also
calculated the communality for each tract. The graphical outputs from the local
structural equation modeling models are shown in Supplementary Figs 10–16: they
confirm the results from the multi-parameter models, providing a more detailed
view of the precise age trajectories.
