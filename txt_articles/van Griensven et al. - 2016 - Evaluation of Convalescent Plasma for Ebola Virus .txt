BACKGROUND
In the wake of the recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in several African 
countries, the World Health Organization prioritized the evaluation of treatment with 
convalescent plasma derived from patients who have recovered from the disease. We 
evaluated the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma for the treatment of EVD in 
Guinea.
METHODS
In this nonrandomized, comparative study, 99 patients of various ages (including preg-
nant women) with confirmed EVD received two consecutive transfusions of 200 to 
250 ml of ABO-compatible convalescent plasma, with each unit of plasma obtained 
from a separate convalescent donor. The transfusions were initiated on the day of 
diagnosis or up to 2 days later. The level of neutralizing antibodies against Ebola 
virus in the plasma was unknown at the time of administration. The control group was 
418 patients who had been treated at the same center during the previous 5 months. 
The primary outcome was the risk of death during the period from 3 to 16 days after 
diagnosis with adjustments for age and the baseline cycle-threshold value on poly-
merase-chain-reaction assay; patients who had died before day 3 were excluded. The 
clinically important difference was defined as an absolute reduction in mortality of 20 
percentage points in the convalescent-plasma group as compared with the control group.
RESULTS
A total of 84 patients who were treated with plasma were included in the primary 
analysis. At baseline, the convalescent-plasma group had slightly higher cycle-threshold 
values and a shorter duration of symptoms than did the control group, along with a 
higher frequency of eye redness and difficulty in swallowing. From day 3 to day 16 
after diagnosis, the risk of death was 31% in the convalescent-plasma group and 38% 
in the control group (risk difference, −7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], −18 to 4). The difference was reduced after adjustment for age and cycle-threshold 
value (adjusted risk difference, −3 percentage points; 95% CI, −13 to 8). No serious 
adverse reactions associated with the use of convalescent plasma were observed.
CONCLUSIONS
The transfusion of up to 500 ml of convalescent plasma with unknown levels of neu-
tralizing antibodies in 84 patients with confirmed EVD was not associated with a 
significant improvement in survival. (Funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
he recent outbreak of Ebola virus 
disease (EVD) in West Africa has been the 
worst ever witnessed. By September 9, 2015, 
a total of 28,183 cases and 11,306 deaths had 
been reported.1 The high case fatality rate (40 to 
60%)2,3 highlights the need for effective EVD-
specific treatments, which would also provide 
an incentive for patients to present to treatment 
centers early. Such interventions would facilitate 
the rapid tracing of contacts of patients and the 
implementation of measures to control the spread 
of an outbreak.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has 
prioritized the evaluation of treatment with con-
valescent whole blood or plasma derived from 
patients who have recovered from EVD.4 Such 
treatment has been used successfully for other 
serious infectious diseases with appropriate safe-
guards.5,6 Data on previous use of convalescent 
whole blood or plasma for the treatment of EVD 
are limited. The largest case series involved eight 
patients who were treated with convalescent 
whole blood during the Kikwit outbreak of EVD 
in 1995; of these patients, seven survived.7 How-
ever, it was not possible to assess whether the 
low case fatality rate was due to treatment with 
convalescent whole blood or other factors, such 
as characteristics of the patients or the period 
during the illness at which treatment was given.7 
Because of uncertainty about the therapeutic 
value of convalescent blood products in the 
treatment of EVD, we conducted the Ebola-Tx 
trial to assess the safety and efficacy of conva-
lescent plasma for the treatment of EVD in 
Conakry, Guinea. We did not evaluate the use 
of convalescent whole blood since convalescent 
plasma was available at the onset of the trial.
Methods
Study Design, Patients, and Intervention
From February 17, 2015, to August 3, 2015, we 
conducted a nonrandomized, comparative study 
at the Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU), which was 
supported by Médecins sans Frontières (MSF), in 
Conakry, Guinea. We determined that the ran-
domization of patients was locally unacceptable 
in the volatile setting of the EVD outbreak.8 All 
eligible patients (of any age and including preg-
nant women) who had symptomatic, laboratory-
confirmed EVD were enrolled. Written informed 
consent was obtained from the patients or their 
surrogates.
Exclusion criteria were a history of allergic 
reaction to blood or plasma products, a medical 
condition in which the infusion of additional 
fluid was contraindicated (e.g., decompensated 
congestive heart failure or renal failure with 
fluid overload), the futility of treatment accord-
ing to a consensus among members of the 
clinical team, and the presence of a condition 
associated with a substantial risk to staff mem-
bers (e.g., agitation). The criteria for futility in-
cluded the presence of shock that was unrespon-
sive to fluid challenge or that was accompanied 
by signs of multiorgan failure (defined as the 
presence of oliguria or anuria and impaired con-
sciousness or the presence of oliguria or anuria 
and jaundice).
Eligible patients received a transfusion of con-
valescent plasma as soon as ABO-compatible 
plasma was available to the treatment center. It 
was planned that the control group would con-
sist of patients who had been admitted to the 
ETU during the preparatory period for the study 
while the system for apheresis and pathogen 
reduction was being set up and those for whom 
ABO-compatible convalescent plasma was not 
available during the study. At the start of recruit-
ment, there was a sufficient amount of convales-
cent plasma available to treat all the patients, so 
a protocol amendment was approved for the 
control group to consist of patients who were 
treated at the same ETU before the initiation of 
the trial. Additional details regarding the con-
duct of the study are provided in the protocol, 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.
In accordance with WHO guidance,4 patients 
received two consecutive transfusions of 200 to 
250 ml of ABO-compatible convalescent plasma 
(i.e., 400 to 500 ml of convalescent plasma in 
total), with each unit of plasma obtained from a 
separate convalescent donor; small adults and 
children weighing less than 45 kg received two 
transfusions of 10 ml of convalescent plasma per 
kilogram of body weight. Each transfusion was 
administered over a 20-minute period, with a 
15-minute interval between the two transfusions.
Study Oversight
The study protocol was approved by the national 
ethics committee in Guinea, the institutional 
review board of the Institute of Tropical Medi-
cine, and the ethics committees of the Antwerp 
University Hospital, the London School of Hygiene

Convalescent Plasma for EVD in Guinea
and Tropical Medicine, MSF, and the WHO. The 
European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and 
Innovation Program and the other funders of the 
study had no role in the study design, the collec-
tion, analysis, or interpretation of the data, or the 
writing of the report. The first author had full 
access to all the study data and had final respon-
sibility for the decision to submit the manuscript 
for publication. (Details are provided in the 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org.)
Procedures
The participation of convalescent donors was 
organized through the Ebola survivor associa-
tion of Conakry (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). For patients with EVD, the determi-
nation of blood group was made with the use of 
the Beth–Vincent method or the MDmulticard 
(Medion Grifols Diagnostics), and ABO-compat-
ible plasma was ordered. Supportive care for all 
patients was based on MSF guidelines for the 
treatment of EVD, including intravenous hydra-
tion and shock management (see the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix).9
Blood samples were obtained from study pa-
tients on three occasions: at the time of diagno-
sis for use in a real-time reverse-transcriptase–
polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for 
Ebola virus (EBOV), blood-group typing, and 
point-of-care laboratory testing (i-STAT); at 24 
hours after transfusion for an RT-PCR assay; and 
at the time of discharge to ascertain EVD cure 
on RT-PCR. Each RT-PCR assay provided a cycle-
threshold value, which is the number of cycles 
required for the fluorescent signal to cross the 
threshold for a positive test. A lower value is cor-
related with a higher viral load.
Laboratory testing for EBOV was performed 
on whole-blood samples at the Guinean national 
laboratory for hemorrhagic fever viruses with 
the use of the QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen) 
for nucleic acid extraction and the LightMix 
Ebola Zaire rRT-PCR Test (TIB MOLBIOL) and a 
SmartCycler (Cepheid) for genomic amplification, 
according to the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions. Patients were discharged after a negative 
result for EBOV on RT-PCR.
Outcome Measures and Definitions
The primary outcome was the risk of death in 
the 14 days after the administration of convales-
cent plasma. Included in the analysis were all 
deaths that occurred up to 16 days after PCR 
confirmation of EVD in the two groups to allow 
for plasma administration up to and including 
the second day after PCR confirmation (by which 
time plasma administration had started in all 
the patients). Patients in the convalescent-plasma 
group were contacted by telephone after dis-
charge to confirm survival up to day 30. Patients 
in the control group who had been discharged 
before day 16 and who had not been followed up 
were assumed to be alive on day 16.
Adverse events and serious adverse events 
that were considered by the treating clinician to 
be reactions that were related to the receipt of 
convalescent plasma were recorded from the 
start of treatment until 4 hours after the end of 
the intervention (see the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix). During transfusion, 
patients were under continuous supervision, 
with vital signs checked every 15 minutes until 
15 minutes after the administration of the sec-
ond plasma unit and at 4 hours after the end of 
the intervention. Safety risks to health workers 
who were administering the transfusions were 
also assessed.
Statistical Analysis
We determined that a risk of death that was 20 
percentage points lower among patients receiv-
ing convalescent plasma than among patients in 
the control group was clinically important, on 
the basis of discussions by international experts 
during two teleconferences organized by the 
WHO and an estimate of the minimum effect 
necessary to justify the substantial investment in 
infrastructure, risk to health care workers, and 
mobilization of resources to organize widespread 
convalescent-plasma treatment in affected coun-
tries (Wood D, WHO: personal communication). 
We calculated that enrollment of up to 130 pa-
tients per group would provide a power of 90% 
to detect an absolute between-group difference of 
20 percentage points, assuming a risk of death 
of 40 to 80% in the control group, at a two-sided 
alpha level of 0.05. Since convalescent plasma 
was available for all the patients and no concur-
rent controls were enrolled, comparative analy-
ses included data from patients who were treated 
at the same ETU during a period that was pre-
specified in the analysis plan as September 2014 
through January 2015. During this period, 507 
patients with confirmed EVD were treated. The 
data and safety monitoring board advised the

termination of the study on July 7, 2015, because 
of the low caseload. At that time, 102 patients 
with confirmed EVD had been enrolled. Although 
fewer than 130 patients had been enrolled in the 
convalescent-plasma group, the increased sam-
ple size in the control group meant that the 
study was still powered to detect an overall ab-
solute difference of 20 percentage points in the 
risk of death.
We used the chi-square test, Fisher’s exact 
test, or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare 
the clinical and demographic characteristics of 
the patients at baseline. The primary analysis 
population, as prespecified in the analysis plan, 
excluded patients who had died before the third 
day after confirmation of EVD on RT-PCR (i.e., 
on the day of diagnosis or on the two following 
days) in order to provide a similar starting point 
for measuring survival, given that the patients in 
the convalescent-plasma group started treatment 
at various times up to and including the second 
day after confirmation on RT-PCR. Patients 
who received other experimental treatments (e.g., 
favipiravir) were also excluded.
We used logistic-regression methods to com-
pare risks of death in the two study groups. 
Adjustments for age and cycle-threshold value 
were prespecified in the statistical analysis plan 
on the basis of published data.10,11 We used logis-
tic regression to estimate the probability of 
death for each patient and calculated adjusted 
risk differences and 95% confidence intervals 
as the differences in the averages of these prob-
abilities.12
Patients were divided into four age groups 
(<5 years, 5 to 15 years, 16 to 44 years, and 
≥45 years).10 Mortality in the control group was 
originally categorized according to five intervals 
for the cycle-threshold values. However, in the 
convalescent-plasma group, the cycle-threshold 
value was less than 20 in the case of only one 
patient and more than 35 in the case of only four 
patients, so we further categorized the cycle-
threshold values into three groups (<25, 25 to 
29.9, and ≥30 cycles) for analysis to avoid 
sparse data. Patients who received incomplete 
transfusions of convalescent plasma were in-
cluded. We used adjusted logistic-regression 
models with interaction terms to perform sub-
group analyses according to age group and cycle-
threshold value.
Results
Patients
A total of 514 patients were assessed at the ETU 
during the study period; the diagnosis of EVD 
was confirmed in 114 of those patients. Twelve 
patients died before enrollment could take place. 
Compatible convalescent plasma was available 
for all 102 patients who were enrolled in the 
trial and was administered to 99 patients, of 
whom 84 were included in the primary analysis 
(Fig. 1). Of the 114 patients with confirmed 
EVD, 19 (17%) died before the third day after 
EVD diagnosis. Five children under the age of 
5 years were treated with convalescent plasma, 
including 4 children who were under 1 year of age.
A total of 507 patients with confirmed EVD 
were admitted and treated with supportive care 
in the 5 months preceding the trial; of these 
patients, 87 (17%) died before the third day after 
EVD diagnosis. Two patients were excluded be-
cause of missing data with respect to outcome 
and age, which left 418 patients to be evaluated 
in the primary analysis.
On average, patients in the convalescent-
plasma group had slightly higher cycle-threshold 
values and a shorter duration of symptoms at 
baseline than did patients in the control group. 
The frequencies of difficulty in swallowing and 
eye redness were higher in the convalescent-
plasma group than in the control group (Table 1). 
Otherwise, the characteristics of the patients were 
generally similar in the two groups at baseline.
Primary Analysis
From day 3 to day 16 after diagnosis, 26 of 84 
patients (31%) in the convalescent-plasma group 
died and 158 of 418 patients (38%) died in the 
control group, for a risk difference of −7 per-
centage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 
−18 to 4). After adjustment for age and cycle-
threshold value, mortality remained lower in the 
convalescent-plasma group, but the difference 
was not significant; the adjusted risk difference 
was −3 percentage points (95% CI, −13 to 8), and 
the adjusted odds ratio was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.51 to 
1.51), as compared with the unadjusted odds 
ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.45 to 1.22) (Table 2).
Of the measured factors that were not bal-
anced in the two study groups, a longer duration 
of symptoms and difficulty in swallowing were

associated with an increased risk of death in the 
control group. Additional adjustment for these 
factors had little effect on results (adjusted odds 
ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.67). The between-
group difference in the risk of death was greater 
among younger patients than among older pa-
tients after adjustment for cycle-threshold value, 
but the subgroups were small and the differ-
ences according to age were not significant 
(Tables 2 and 3).
Among the 84 patients in the convalescent-
plasma group who were included in the primary 
analysis, there was 1 major protocol deviation in 
which a patient received less than 90% of the 
recommended volume of convalescent plasma, 
and there were 14 minor deviations involving 11 
patients (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). The exclusion of the patient with the major 
protocol deviation had a negligible effect on the 
between-group results. One day after the trans-

Of the 514 patients who were screened, 412 were excluded, which left 102 patients who were eligible to be enrolled 
and assessed for eligibility to receive convalescent plasma. During screening, 400 patients were found to be neg-
ative for Ebola virus (EBOV) on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Of the remaining 114 patients with con-
firmed EVD, 19 (17%) died before the third day after EVD diagnosis. During the 5 months preceding the trial, 87  
of the 507 patients with confirmed EVD (17%) in the historical control group died before the third day after EVD 
 
diagnosis. In the convalescent-plasma group, 10 patients who were health care workers were subsequently referred 
to a center dedicated to the care of such workers, where they received favipiravir in a different trial; of these patients, 
7 survived.

fusion of convalescent plasma, the median cycle-
threshold value increased by 3.5 cycles (Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse Reactions
No serious adverse reactions were observed in 
the 99 patients who received convalescent plas-
ma. Eight patients (8%) had an adverse reaction 
during or early after the transfusion. These reac-
tions resolved spontaneously with treatment of 
the symptoms or a reduced rate of transfusion 
(Table 4, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). No safety events related to convalescent-
plasma transfusion were reported among health 
care staff members.
Discussion
We observed no serious adverse reactions asso-
ciated with the transfusion of convalescent 
plasma, and the procedure was acceptable to 
both donors and patients. In the adjusted analy-
sis, the risk of death was slightly lower in the 
convalescent-plasma group than in the control 
group, but the difference was not significant. 
The prespecified clinically relevant difference 
(mortality that was lower by 20 percentage points 
in the convalescent-plasma group than in the 
control group) could be excluded (adjusted risk 
difference, −3 percentage points; 95% CI, −13 
to 8). Mortality was analyzed up to day 16, since 
most patients with EVD have either recovered or 
died before this time. We did not have 30-day 
follow-up on the control patients, and 1 patient 
in the convalescent-plasma group died between 
day 16 and day 30 after being discharged as 
EVD-free and transferred to another medical fa-
cility for the management of another condition.
The level of EBOV-neutralizing antibodies in 
donor plasma could be important for the effec-
tiveness of this intervention, as has been shown 
in studies involving nonhuman primates.13,14 
However, we could not determine the level of 
neutralizing antibodies in the donor plasma 
before transfusion. EBOV plaque-neutralization 
assays require access to biosafety level 4 labo-

The primary outcome was the risk of death in the 14 days after the administration of convalescent plasma. Included in 
the analysis were all deaths that occurred up to 16 days after PCR confirmation of EVD on real-time reverse-transcrip-
tase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay in the two groups to allow for plasma administration up to and includ-
ing the second day after RT-PCR confirmation. Patients who had died before the third day after confirmation of EVD on 
RT-PCR were excluded from the analysis to provide a similar starting point for measuring survival. The unadjusted be-
tween-group difference in the convalescent-plasma group was −7 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], −18 
to 4), and the adjusted between-group difference was −3 percentage points (95% CI, −13 to 8).

ratories, which are currently unavailable in the 
affected countries, and shipment of blood sam-
ples abroad for sample testing was not possible 
at the time of this report. Consequently, unless 
convalescent plasma has been stockpiled during 
an EVD outbreak (in which case, anti-EBOV titers 
would already be known), it will probably be 
available without information regarding anti-
body levels at the time of administration until 
simple, field-adapted assays become available. 
Antibody levels are often low in some patients 
during early convalescence, which may have di-
luted the effect of convalescent plasma. Analyses 
of the level of EBOV-neutralizing antibodies in 
plasma donations and the correlation between 
such levels and the survival of patients will need 
to be performed. It is possible that high-titer

Each RT-PCR assay provided a cycle-threshold value, which is the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal 
to cross the threshold for a positive test. A lower value is correlated with a higher viral load.

Convalescent Plasma for EVD in Guinea
might be more potent. In addition, we do not 
know the most effective frequency of adminis-
tration of convalescent plasma, and repeated 
administration with higher total volumes than 
those used in our study might be required.
We cannot exclude the possibility that some 
patients will benefit more than others from treat-
ment with convalescent plasma. Of possible in-
terest is that children younger than 5 years of 
age with EVD, who are known to have a poor 
prognosis,10 had the highest risk of death in the 
control group (Table 3). However, four of the 
five patients in this age group who were treated 
with convalescent plasma survived. Although 
pregnant women with EVD also have a poor 
prognosis,15 six of the eight pregnant women 
who were treated with convalescent plasma sur-
vived. These patients might also have benefited 
from the coagulation factors present in the plas-
ma. Unfortunately, pregnancy was incompletely 
recorded in the control group.
The lack of obvious identified safety issues 
with the transfusion of convalescent plasma in 
an ETU is reassuring, since there was concern 
that serious adverse reactions might occur more 
frequently than they did. However, it is difficult 
to distinguish complications such as transfusion-
related acute lung injury from EVD progression.16
In our comparative design, the control group 
was supposed to consist of patients who had 
presented before ABO-compatible plasma was 
available. However, with many survivors volun-
teering to donate, there was no shortage of 
convalescent plasma during the trial, so all the 
control patients were historical patients. There 
are clear limitations with respect to the use of a 
historical control group, and we cannot exclude 
the possibility that unmeasured confounding 
factors may have biased the mortality compari-
son. We also included the cycle-threshold value 
as a surrogate marker for viral load. Although 
there was variation in the risk of death during 
the 5-month historical period, there was no clear 
trend; our conclusions remained unchanged 
when the comparison was restricted to patients 
who were treated during the 3 months preceding 
the administration of convalescent plasma. We 
also conducted an intention-to-treat analysis in 
which we compared the risk of death among all 
the patients in whom EVD was diagnosed during 
the period of the convalescent-plasma trial with 
the risk of death among all historical patients; 
this analysis yielded results that were similar to 
those in the primary analysis (see the Results 
section in the Supplementary Appendix).
The adjusted analyses that we conducted are 
unlikely to account for any variability in support-
ive care, such as the introduction of the point-of-
care test, or for differences in caseload over time. 
Moreover, the administration of convalescent 
plasma requires intravenous access, which could 
have resulted in an increased administration of 
intravenous fluid beyond the plasma transfusion. 
Such factors (e.g., possible variability in support-
ive care and in administration of intravenous 
fluids) could have contributed to lowering the 
mortality in the convalescent-plasma group, but 
despite this fact, we did not find significantly 
lower mortality among the patients who received 
convalescent plasma than among patients who 
did not. The assessment of a dose–response re-
lationship between the level of neutralizing anti-
bodies in donor plasma and changes in viral 
load after transfusion or changes in survival 
could be important in determining any direct 
effect of antibody therapy.
We found that treatment with convalescent 
plasma was feasible to organize and administer 
and was acceptable to donors, patients, family, 
and health care providers in the middle of an 
EVD outbreak. Although uncertainty remains 
about our findings because of the nonrandom-
ized nature of the study and the use of historical 
controls, we could not detect a marked survival 
effect of the administration of a dose of 200 to 
250 ml of convalescent plasma twice daily. It 
remains to be assessed whether plasma with 
high levels of EBOV-neutralizing antibodies, pos-
sibly administered repeatedly, would show effi-
cacy and whether subgroups of patients, such as 
young children and pregnant women, would be 
more likely to benefit.
