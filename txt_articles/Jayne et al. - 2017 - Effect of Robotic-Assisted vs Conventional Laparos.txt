IMPORTANCE Robotic rectal cancer surgery is gaining popularity, but limited data are available
regarding safety and efficacy.
OBJECTIVE To compare robotic-assisted vs conventional laparoscopic surgery for risk of
conversion to open laparotomy among patients undergoing resection for rectal cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial comparing robotic-assisted vs
conventional laparoscopic surgery among 471 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma suitable
for curative resection conducted at 29 sites across 10 countries, including 40 surgeons.
Recruitment of patients was from January 7, 2011, to September 30, 2014, follow-up was
conducted at 30 days and 6 months, and final follow-up was on June 16, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to robotic-assisted (n = 237) or conventional
(n = 234) laparoscopic rectal cancer resection, performed by either high (upper rectum) or
low (total rectum) anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection (rectum and perineum).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was conversion to open laparotomy.
Secondary end points included intraoperative and postoperative complications,
circumferential resection margin positivity (CRM+) and other pathological outcomes, quality
of life (36-Item Short Form Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), bladder
and sexual dysfunction (International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile
Function, and Female Sexual Function Index), and oncological outcomes.
RESULTS Among 471 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 64.9 [11.0] years; 320 [67.9%]
men), 466 (98.9%) completed the study. The overall rate of conversion to open laparotomy
was 10.1%. The overall CRM+ rate was 5.7%. Of the other 8 reported prespecified secondary
end points, including intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, plane of
surgery, 30-day mortality, bladder dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction, none showed
a statistically significant difference between groups.

 L
aparoscopic surgery is increasingly used for the treat-
ment of colon cancer, but its use for rectal cancer is more
controversial. Two recent, large, multicenter random-
ized clinical trials1,2 support laparoscopic surgery, and 2 other
major trials3,4 report evidence that does not allow a designa-
tion of noninferior as compared with open surgery.
Robotic assistance has the potential to overcome some
of the limitations of laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery, pro-
viding an immersive 3-dimensional depth of field, articulat-
ing instruments, and a stable camera platform. Several
small, nonrandomized studies have supported its safety and
efficacy in rectal cancer surgery.5,6 Meta-analyses have
failed to show superiority for robotic-assisted laparoscopic
surgery over conventional laparoscopic surgery in short-
term patient and pathological outcomes and have consis-
tently reported longer operating times, but they have also
shown a reduced need to convert to open surgery with the
robot.7,8 A few nonrandomized studies have suggested that
the robot may offer better preservation of bladder and
sexual function.9,10
The main concern about robotic surgery is the cost, in-
cluding the capital and ongoing maintenance charges. A few
studies have analyzed the costs of robotic rectal cancer sur-
gery, reporting higher total hospital costs than for conven-
tional laparoscopic surgery.11,12 Despite this, robotic rectal can-
cer surgery has continued to gain global utilization.
In 2009, the UK Medical Research Council and National
Institute of Health Research, through the Efficacy and
Mechanism Evaluation Programme, funded the Robotic vs
Laparoscopic Resection for Rectal Cancer (ROLARR) trial to
undertake an evaluation of the safety, efficacy, and short-
and long-term outcomes of robotic-assisted vs conventional
laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. This trial was designed
as a multicenter, international randomized clinical trial to
accommodate the limited adoption of the robotic system
at that time. This article presents the short-term results to
6-month follow-up.
Methods
This is an international, multicenter, randomized, unblinded,
parallel-group trial13 comparing robotic-assisted vs conven-
tional laparoscopic surgery for the curative treatment of rec-
tal adenocarcinoma (distal extent ≤15 cm of the anal margin)
by high anterior resection, low anterior resection, or abdomi-
noperineal resection. Participating surgeons had to perform
at least 30 minimally invasive (conventional laparoscopic
or robotic-assisted laparoscopic) rectal cancer resections
before taking part in the trial, of which at least 10 had to be
conventional laparoscopic resections and at least 10 had
to be robotic-assisted laparoscopic resections.14 The trial
received national ethical approval in the United Kingdom or
either local ethical committee or institutional review board
approval at international centers. An independent trial steer-
ing committee and data monitoring and ethics committee
oversaw the trial conduct. All participants provided written
informed consent.
The trial design has been reported previously,13 and the
full trial protocol is included in Supplement 1. For patients to
be included, they had to be fit for resectional surgery with a
diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Patients with
benign lesions of the rectum, cancers of the anal canal,
locally advanced cancers not amenable to curative surgery or
requiring en bloc multivisceral resection, or synchronous
colorectal tumors requiring multisegment surgical resection
were not eligible.
Randomization(minimizationincorporatingarandomele-
ment) was on a 1:1 basis. The stratification factors were treat-
ing surgeon, patient, sex, preoperative radiotherapy or che-
moradiotherapy, intended procedure, and body mass index
(BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared) classified according to World Health Organi-
zation criteria.15
The specifics of each operation were at the discretion of
the operating surgeon. The only absolute requirement
under robotic surgery was that the robot had to be used for
mesorectal resection. Pathology reporting was according to
internationally agreed criteria.16 Patient self-reported blad-
der function and sexual function were measured at baseline
and 6 months following surgery with the International Pros-
tate Symptom Score (I-PSS), International Index of Erectile
Function (IIEF), and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).
The I-PSS17 is a standardized, patient self-reported measure
of the subjective problems that the patient experiences with
urinating, with scores ranging from 0 to 35 and higher
scores indicating more severe symptoms. The IIIEF18 is a
patient self-reported measure developed for the assessment
of erectile function, with scores ranging from 5 to 75 and
lower scores indicating greater severity of dysfunction. The
FSFI19 is a patient self-reported measure of sexual function
in women, with scores ranging from 2 to 36 and higher
scores indicating greater function. Patients underwent clini-
cal review at 30 days and 6 months postoperatively. Annual
follow-up is continuing.
The primary end point was the rate of conversion to open
surgery, defined as the use of a laparotomy wound for any
part of the mesorectal dissection. The use of a small abdomi-
nal wound to facilitate a low, stapled anastomosis and/or
Key Points
Question Does robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, as
compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery, reduce the risk
of conversion to laparotomy among patients undergoing surgery
for rectal cancer?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 471 patients
undergoing surgery for rectal cancer, the conversion rate
was 8.1% for robotic surgery and 12.2% for laparoscopic surgery,
not a statistically significant difference.
Meaning Among patients undergoing resection for rectal cancer,
robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery performed by surgeons
with varying experience with robotic surgery did not confer
an advantage compared with laparoscopic surgery for reducing
the odds of conversion to laparotomy.

 specimen extraction was permissible and not defined as an
open conversion. Secondary end points were all prespecified
and included pathological circumferential resection margin
positivity (CRM+; defined as tumor ≤1 mm), intraoperative
complications, postoperative (30-day and 6-month) compli-
cations, 30-day operative mortality, patient-reported bladder
and sexual function, and pathological assessment of the
quality of the plane of surgery. Quality of the plane of surgery
was judged according to the method of Quirke and Dixon,20
grading the pathology specimen in terms of completeness
of surgical resection. For high and low anterior resection,
this was defined as mesorectal (best), intramesorectal (inter-
mediate), and muscularis propria (worst). For abdominoperi-
neal excision, this was defined as levator (best), sphincteric
(intermediate), and intrasphincteric (worst). Other prespeci-
fied secondary end points, not reported herein, include cen-
tral pathology review with photographic documentation of
resection specimens, and a full quality-of-life analysis. A full
health economic evaluation was undertaken separately.
Longer-term end points (local recurrence rates, disease-free
survival, and overall survival) will be reported at 3 years after
the last patient randomization.
The target sample size was 400 patients, which provides
80% power at the 5% (2-sided) level of significance to detect
a reduction in the conversion rate from 25% in the conven-
tional laparoscopic group to 12.5% in the robotic-assisted
laparoscopic group, allowing for 16% attrition.13 The antici-
pated conversion rate in the conventional laparoscopic group
was based on the MRC CLASICC Trial, which was the best
available evidence at that time. The MRC CLASICC trial
reported a conversion rate of 34% for conventional laparo-
scopic rectal cancer resection,21 which was reduced to 25% to
account for advances in surgical technique. Sufficient fund-
ing was available to extend recruitment to 471 patients to
take advantage of excellent patient recruitment and maxi-
mize the power of the study. This decision was made in con-
sultation with the independent trial steering committee and
data monitoring and ethics committee without review of data
or an interim analysis being performed.
All analyses were prespecified and were conducted on
the intention-to-treat population, ie, all randomized patients
were accounted for in the analyses, and patients were catego-
rized into treatment groups based on their randomization
regardless of what treatment they subsequently received.
Complete case analyses were performed for all prespecified
end points. When the complete case analysis excluded more
than 3% of patients due to missing data, exploratory analyses
to investigate the effect of missing data were performed. Spe-
cifically, to explore the mechanism of the missing data and
the validity of a complete case analysis for each end point,
patient characteristics were compared between those with
and without missing data and multilevel logistic regression
models were used to identify any associations between prog-
nostic variables and whether a patient had missing data, to
inform whether data were missing at random. All hypothesis
tests were 2-sided and conducted at the 5% level of signifi-
cance. Estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence
intervals and P values are presented for fixed effects. For the
(random) surgeon effect, the intracluster correlation coeffi-
cient, estimated via the analysis-of-variance method, and
bias-corrected bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are
reported.22,23 Analyses were carried out in SAS version 9.4
statistical software (SAS Institute Inc).
Multilevellogisticregressionwasusedtoestimatetheodds
ratios (ORs) for conversion to laparotomy, CRM+, intraopera-
tive complications, and postoperative complications be-
tween treatment groups, adjusting for the stratification fac-
tors,whereoperatingsurgeonwasmodeledasarandomeffect.
Generalized linear mixed models were used to compare
6-monthbladderandsexualfunctionscores,adjustingforbase-
line scores and the stratification factors.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the
robustness of the findings from the primary analysis, includ-
ing extension of the primary analysis to account for potential
learning effects by including interaction terms for the operat-
ing surgeon’
s level of relevant robotic-assisted and conven-
tional laparoscopic experience and the treatment effect.
Subgroup analyses relating to the primary end point across
sex, BMI class, and procedure received as well as relating to
CRM+ across sex, BMI class, and T stage were performed.
All subgroup analyses tested heterogeneity of the treatment
effect across the subgroups and also estimated the treat-
ment effect within each subgroup, via the inclusion of an
appropriate interaction term. All sensitivity analyses and
subgroup analyses were prespecified.
Cost analysis was undertaken from the perspective of a
public (ie, UK National Health Service [NHS]) health care pro-
fessionalforallpatients(eAppendix1andeTable1inSupplement
2). Resource utilization data for 190 UK and US patients were
collected at baseline, intraoperatively, 30 days postopera-
tively, and 6 months postoperatively using study forms.
Costs were computed in British pounds using a price year of
2015 and estimated using UK NHS unit costs from national
data sources including the NHS Reference Costs database,
Personal Social Services Research Unit costs of health and
social care, and British National Formulary. For reporting
purposes, costs are converted with 2015 Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development purchasing power
parity (0.866 British pound per 1 US dollar) and reported
herein as 2015 US dollars. Multiple imputation methods were
used for missing data. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to
account for uncertainty (eAppendix 2, eTables 2 and 3, and
eFigure in Supplement 2). Given wide variation in costs due
to contractual arrangements, acquisition and maintenance
costs for the robotic-assisted and conventional laparoscopic
systems were excluded.

erative chemotherapy, with no difference between the 2
treatment groups.
Conversion Rate
Conversion to open surgery occurred in 47 of 466 patients
(10.1%) overall: 28 of 230 patients (12.2%) in the conventional
laparoscopic group and 19 of 236 patients (8.1%) in the robotic-
assisted laparoscopic group (unadjusted difference in propor-
tions, 4.1% [95% CI, −1.4% to 9.6%]). There was no statisti-
cally significant difference between robotic-assisted and
conventional laparoscopic surgery with respect to odds of con-
version (adjusted OR = 0.61 [95% CI, 0.31 to 1.21]; P = .16).
Table 2 presents results from the multilevel logistic regres-
sion model and shows significantly increased odds of conver-
sion in obese patients as compared with underweight or
normal-weight patients (adjusted OR = 4.69 [95% CI, 2.08
to 10.58]; P < .001) and in men as compared with women
(adjusted OR = 2.44 [95% CI, 1.05 to 5.71]; P = .04). Patients
whose intended procedure was a low anterior resection had a
significantly higher rate of conversion as compared with pa-
tients whose intended procedure was abdominoperineal re-
section (adjusted OR = 5.44 [95% CI, 1.60 to 18.52]; P = .007).

 conversion, as reflected by the intracluster correlation coeffi-
cient estimate of 0.05 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.06).
Results from the sensitivity analysis that extended the pri-
mary analysis model to account for potential learning effects
suggest that the benefit of robotic-assisted laparoscopic sur-
gery compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery (with
respect to conversion rate) is greater under surgeons who have
more robotic-assisted laparoscopic experience, regardless of
their level of conventional laparoscopic experience (eAppen-
dix 2, eTables 2 and 3, and eFigure in Supplement 2).
No results from the prespecified subgroup analyses were
statistically significant. Regarding the sex subgroup analysis,
39 of 317 men (12.3%) underwent conversion to laparotomy,
25 of 156 (16.0%) in the conventional laparoscopic group and
14 of 161 (8.7%) in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group
(unadjusted difference in proportions = 7.3% [95% CI, 0.1% to
14.6%]); 8 of 149 women (5.4%) underwent conversion to
laparotomy, 3 of 74 (4.1%) in the conventional laparoscopic
group and 5 of 75 (6.7%) in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic
group (unadjusted difference in proportions = −2.6% [95%
CI, −9.8% to 4.6%]). A Wald test of interaction between treat-
ment effect and sex in the adjusted model yielded P = .09,
and the estimated adjusted OR for conversion to laparotomy
(robotic-assisted vs conventional laparoscopic surgery) in
men given by the model was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99;
P = .04). Further details on all subgroup analyses are given in
eAppendix 3 and eTables 4, 5, and 6 in Supplement 2.
Pathology Outcomes
The pathological outcomes are shown in Table 1. The major-
ity of tumors, 356 of 466 (76.4%), were pT2 or pT3. The total
number of lymph nodes retrieved at pathology (lymph node
yield) was high in both the conventional and robotic-assisted
laparoscopic groups (mean [SD], 24.1 [12.91] vs 23.2 [11.97]
lymph nodes, respectively). Of 466 patients who had an
operation, 459 (98.5%) had complete pathology data avail-
able. Of these 459 patients, 26 (5.7%) had CRM+: 14 of 224
(6.2%) in the conventional laparoscopic group and 12 of 235
(5.1%) in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group (unadjusted
difference in proportions = 1.1% [95% CI, −3.1% to 5.4%]).
There was no statistically significant difference in the odds of
CRM+ between the groups (adjusted OR = 0.78 [95% CI, 0.35
to 1.76]; P = .56) (Table 3). Subgroup analyses were largely
uninformative owing to the low overall CRM+ rate. Proximal
margin involvement was not observed in any patients, and
distal margin involvement was observed in only 1 patient in
the conventional laparoscopic group. Pathological assess-
ment of the quality of the plane of surgery for the mesorectal
area was captured for 456 of 466 patients (97.9%), and the
quality of the plane was of the highest standard (mesorectal
plane) in 351 of 456 cases (77.0%): 173 of 223 (77.6%) in the
conventional laparoscopic group and 178 of 233 (76.4%) in
the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group (unadjusted differ-
ence in proportions = 1.2% [95% CI, −6.5% to 8.9%]). There
was no statistically significant difference in the odds of
achieving the highest-standard plane of surgery (mesorectal
plane) between the groups (adjusted OR = 0.94 [95% CI, 0.56
to 1.57]; P = .14) (Table 3).
Complications
Table 4 shows the complication rates up to 6 months postop-
eratively. Of 466 patients, 70 (15.0%) had an intraoperative
complication: 34 of 230 (14.8%) in the conventional laparo-
scopic group and 36 of 236 (15.3%) in the robotic-assisted lapa-
roscopic group (unadjusted risk difference = −0.5% [95% CI,
−6.0% to 7.0%]). There was no significant difference be-
tween the groups (adjusted OR = 1.02 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.74];
P = .94). The most common intraoperative complications were
damage to an organ or structure, significant hemorrhage, and
surgical equipment failure. Overall, 151 patients (32.4%) re-
portedacomplicationwithin30days:73of230patients(31.7%)
in the conventional laparoscopic group and 78 of 236 (33.1%)
in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group (unadjusted risk dif-
ference = −1.3% [95% CI, −9.8% to 7.2%]). There was no sig-
nificant difference between the groups (adjusted OR = 1.04
[95% CI, 0.69 to 1.58]; P = .84). Seventy-two patients (15.5%)
reported a complication after 30 days and within 6 months:
38 of 230 patients (16.5%) in the conventional laparoscopic
group and 34 of 236 (14.4%) in the robotic-assisted laparo-
scopicgroup(unadjustedriskdifference = 2.1%[95%CI,−4.5%
to 8.7%]). There was no significant difference between the
groups (adjusted OR = 0.72 [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.26]; P = .25). The
occurrence of anastomotic leak was determined by the sur-
geon and reported as gastrointestinal complication. Of the 361
patients with an anastomosis, 40 (11.1%) reported an anasto-
motic leak within 6 months: 18 of 181 patients (9.9%) in the

robotic-assisted laparoscopic group.
Mortality Within 30 Days Postoperatively
Mortality was a rare event, with 4 deaths (0.9%) among 466
patients (2 in each group). All deaths were related to the sur-
gical intervention and involved a septic complication.
Postoperative Bladder and Sexual Function
Patient self-reported assessment of bladder function be-
tween baseline and 6 months was complete in 351 of 466 cases
(75.3%). Patient self-reported assessment of sexual function
was complete in 181 of 320 men (56.6%) and 54 of 151 women
(35.8%).Exploratoryanalysescomparingprognosticfactorsbe-
tween patients with and without complete data and also be-
tween the 2 treatment groups showed that the conclusions of
the complete case analyses are robust to any potential effect
of the missing data.
The I-PSS scores for bladder function (with higher
scores indicating worse function on a scale of 0-35) for con-
ventional and robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery at base-
line and 6 months are presented in Figure 2. The adjusted
analysis comparing 6-month scores yielded an estimated
difference (conventional laparoscopic group minus robotic-
assisted laparoscopic group) of 0.743 (95% CI, −0.587 to
2.072; P = .27), indicating there was no statistically signifi-
cant difference between the groups.
The IIEF scores for male sexual function (with higher
scores indicating worse function on a scale of 5-75) and FSFI
scores for female sexual function (with higher scores indicat-
ing better function on a scale of 2-36) for conventional and
robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery at baseline and 6
months are also presented in Figure 2. Adjusted analyses
comparing the 6-month scores yielded an estimated IIEF
total score difference (conventional laparoscopic group
minus robotic-assisted laparoscopic group) of 0.802 (95% CI,
−4.100 to 5.704; P = .75) and an estimated FSFI total score
difference (conventional laparoscopic group minus robotic-
assisted laparoscopic group) of 1.231 (95% CI, −3.541 to 6.003;
P = .60), indicating there was no difference between the
groups.
Health Economic Analysis
Multiple imputation was used to provide data for all 190 US
and UK patients. The health care costs in the robotic-assisted
laparoscopic group (mean of £11 853 or $13 668 [95% CI,
$13 025-$14 350]) were higher than in the conventional lapa-
roscopic group (mean of £10 874 or $12 556 [95% CI, $11 889-
$13 223]), and this difference was statistically significant
(mean difference = £980 or $1132 [95% CI, $191-$2072];
P = .02). The main drivers of higher operative costs were lon-
ger mean use of the operating theater (robotic-assisted lapa-
roscopic group minus conventional laparoscopic group, dif-
ference = 50.88 minutes [95% CI, 20.26-81.56]; P = .001) and
the mean cost of instruments (robotic-assisted laparoscopic
group minus conventional laparoscopic group, differ-
ence = £513 or $593 [95% CI, $493-$693]; P < .001).
Health care resource allocation data were complete in
47 of 95 patients receiving conventional laparoscopic sur-
gery and 52 of 95 patients receiving robotic-assisted laparo-
scopic surgery. Among the patients with complete data, the
mean cost for patients receiving conventional laparoscopic
surgery was slightly lower than the imputed analysis
($12 341 vs $12 556, respectively) and was almost identical to
the mean cost for patients receiving robotic-assisted laparo-
scopic surgery ($13 691 vs $13 688, respectively).
Discussion
In this study, to our knowledge the largest randomized clini-
cal trial of robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery for patients
with rectal adenocarcinoma suitable for curative resection,
there were no statistically significant differences in the rates
of conversion to open laparotomy for robotic-assisted laparo-
scopic surgery compared with conventional laparoscopic

 surgery (8.1% vs 12.2%, respectively), and there were no sta-
tistically significant differences in CRM+, complication rates,
or quality of life at 6 months. There is insufficient evidence to
conclude that robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, com-
pared with conventional laparoscopic surgery, reduces the
risk of conversion to open laparotomy when performed by
surgeons of varying experience with robotic-assisted surgery.
The primary outcome measure was conversion to open
surgery, based on the hypothesis that the technological
advantages of the robot should facilitate rectal cancer resec-
tion and avoid the need to convert to an open operation. The
sample size calculations were based on best available evi-
dence in 2009, including the largest randomized clinical trial
of conventional laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery, the MRC
CLASICC trial, which reported a 34% conversion rate to open
surgery.21 A 25% conversion rate from conventional laparo-
scopic to open surgery was assumed, giving a sample size of
400 patients to demonstrate a 50% relative reduction in the
conversion rate with robotic-assisted surgery. The actual
overall conversion rate was much lower, 10.1%. A similar
reduction in conversion rates with time has been reported in
other conventional laparoscopic rectal cancer trials: COLOR
II, 16%24; ACOSOG Z6051, 11%4; and ALaCaRT, 9%.3 In our
trial, the difference in conversion rates between conventional
laparoscopic surgery (12.2%) and robotic-assisted laparo-
scopic surgery (8.1%) was not statistically significant. The sta-
tistically significant lower overall conversion in patients
undergoing low anterior resection, as compared with
abdominoperineal resection, probably reflects that the
majority of the oncological component of the operation is
performed from the perineum in the abdominoperineal
approach and is less affected by the laparoscopic approach.
Similarly, the higher overall conversion rates for men (as
compared with women) and obese patients (as compared
with underweight or normal-weight patients) probably
reflect the increasing technical difficulty in these patients.
The sensitivity analysis exploring learning effects sug-
gested a potential benefit of robotic surgery when performed
by surgeons with substantial prior robotic-assisted laparo-
scopicexperience,regardlessoftheirlevelofconventionallapa-
roscopic experience. This suggests that most participating sur-
geons were experts in conventional laparoscopic surgery but
still in their learning phases for robotic-assisted laparoscopic
surgery and that at the higher end of the spectrum of experi-
ence in robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery there is evi-
dence of a benefit (in terms of conversion rate) over conven-
tional laparoscopic surgery.
In almost all of the subgroup analyses, there were insuf-
ficient numbers of patients to produce statistically meaning-
fulcomparisonsbetweenthegroupsregardingtheneedtocon-
vert to an open operation. However, differences were apparent
in the conversion rates for the conventional and robotic-
assistedlaparoscopicgroupsinmen,withrobotic-assistedlapa-
roscopic surgery appearing to offer a benefit. While results
yielded by a subgroup analysis must be interpreted with cau-
tion, the moderate evidence of interaction between sex and
treatment effect, evidence of a difference between treat-
ments in men, and the clinical plausibility of the robot facili-
tating dissections in the narrower male pelvis with more op-
erator-controlled retraction, better optics, and instrument
precision all warrant further investigation into the potential

 benefit of robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery in this sub-
group of technically challenging patients.
The experience of the participating surgeons was also
evident in the low CRM+ rate (overall, 5.7%), which was
lower than previous trials studying conventional laparoscopy
for rectal cancer: COLOR II, 10%; ACOSOG Z6051, 12.1%; and
ALaCaRT, 7%. Pathological grading of the plane of surgery
showed a good standard, with mesorectal plane surgery
observed in 75.3% overall. This is lower than reported in
COLOR II (88%) and ALaCaRT (87%), but similar to ACOSOG
Z6051 (72.9%), and is probably due to the recognized varia-
tion in reporting between pathologists. In our trial, reporting
of the pathological plane of surgery was standardized to the
method described by Nagtegaal and Quirke.25
In accordance with other studies, robotic-assisted laparo-
scopic surgery was associated with longer operating times and
no benefit over conventional laparoscopic surgery in length of
hospital stay.7,26 A full health care economics analysis will be
reported separately.
The complication rates following conventional and
robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery were similar, and
there were no safety issues attributable to the robotic sys-
tem. Overall 30-day mortality was low at 0.9%, in keeping
with the results of meta-analyses.7 The leading causes of
intraoperative morbidity were iatrogenic damage to an
organ or structure and significant hemorrhage. In contrast
to other studies, hemorrhage was not more frequently asso-
ciated with robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery.27 Rectal
cancer surgery is a high-risk intervention, with 32.4% of
patients experiencing a complication within 30 days and
15.5% of patients having complications between 30 days
and 6 months.
Previous studies have shown that both conventional and
robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer can re-
sult in bladder and sexual dysfunction, but the studies sug-
gest that recovery is earlier for robotic-assisted laparoscopic
surgery.10,28 This analysis of bladder and sexual function, at
the same time points and using the same research question-
naires, does not support previous findings. There was little
change in the I-PSS, IIEF, and FSFI scores between baseline and
6 months postoperatively, suggesting that the surgeons were
accomplished in autonomic nerve preservation and that clini-
cally relevant bladder and sexual dysfunction were an infre-
quent event.
Results from the health economics analysis suggest that
robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer is
unlikely to be cost-saving. The mean difference per opera-
tion, excluding the acquisition and maintenance costs, was
£980 ($1132) and driven by longer operating theater time and
increased costs for robotic instruments. When considering
robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery as a whole, rather than
just rectal cancer surgery, one has to consider the cost of pur-
chase and maintenance of the system, the operational life,
and the total utilization of the robot per year for all robotic
procedures. Estimates of acquisition costs in 2017 vary
between $0.6 million and $2.5 million, with maintenance
costs between $0.08 million and $0.17 million per year.29
Assuming a midpoint acquisition cost of $1.55 million and
midpoint maintenance cost of $0.125 million per year, with
an operational life and amortization period of 7 years,30,31 the
total cost of a robot would be approximately $2.425 million.
Estimates for total utilization of the robot per year in 2017
vary between 819 000 and 843 000 procedures across 3919
installed systems, or 1505 procedures per robot over 7
years.29 This gives the total fixed cost of around $1611 per
procedure, in addition to the variable costs.
Alternatively stated, the net benefits (excluding fixed
costs) of any robotic procedure included in a set of cost-
effective procedures need to be positive, and the entire set of
cost-effective procedures needs to have an average net ben-
efit of at least $1611. On average, all robotic procedures com-
bined must exceed this figure, with all procedures making at
least some positive contribution. On the basis of the evidence
presented here, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery for rec-
tal cancer does not appear to provide a positive contribution
and does not appear to be justified given the extra costs and
equivalency of clinical outcomes.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. The much lower than
anticipated rate of conversion to open laparotomy limits the
ability to provide conclusive evidence about our primary
question of how robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery com-
pares with conventional laparoscopic surgery in odds of
conversion. However, the fact that no statistically signifi-
cant differences between the treatment groups were seen in
any of the end points does suggest that robotic-assisted
laparoscopic surgery, when performed by surgeons with
varying robotic experience, does not confer a clinically
important benefit over conventional laparoscopic surgery in
the short term.
No blinding to treatment allocation was incorporated
into this trial. The primary end point and the measure of
mortality were certainly unaffected by this as objective end
points. However, there is the potential for end points that
are not completely objective to have been affected. In our
pathology end points, including CRM+, we have guarded
against this by carrying out a blinded central review of
pathology assessments.
Despite enforcing a mandatory minimum experience
level for surgeon participation, operations in this trial were
performed, on average, by a surgeon considered to be an
expert in conventional laparoscopic surgery and who may
still have been in his or her learning phase for robotic-
assisted laparoscopic surgery. The prespecified sensitiv-
ity analysis of learning effects addresses this by extend-
ing the primary analysis model to analyze the interaction
between operating surgeon experience and the treat-
ment effect (eAppendix 2, eTables 2 and 3, and eFigure in
Supplement 2).
The primary analysis adjusted only for stratification fac-
tors (including operating surgeon) and thus did not include
an adjustment for treating site. A (prespecified) adjustment
for treating site was considered in a sensitivity analysis, but
model estimation issues were caused by the small sizes of
the resulting strata, resulting in no meaningful output.

 Conclusions
Among patients with rectal adenocarcinoma suitable for cura-
tiveresection,robotic-assistedlaparoscopicsurgery,ascompared
withconventionallaparoscopicsurgery,didnotsignificantlyre-
duce the risk of conversion to open laparotomy. These findings
suggest that robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, when per-
formed by surgeons with varying experience with robotic sur-
gery, does not confer an advantage in rectal cancer resection.
