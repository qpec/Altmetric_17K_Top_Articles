Abstract
How does cortical tissue change as brain function and behavior improve from childhood to 
adulthood? By combining quantitative and functional magnetic resonance imaging in children and 
adults, we find differential development of high-level visual areas that are involved in face and 
place recognition. Development of face-selective regions, but not place-selective regions, is 
dominated by microstructural proliferation. This tissue development is correlated with specific 
increases in functional selectivity to faces, as well as improvements in face recognition, and 
ultimately leads to differentiated tissue properties between face-and place-selective regions in 
adulthood, which we validate with postmortem cytoarchitectonic measurements. These data 
suggest a new model by which emergent brain function and behavior result from cortical tissue 
proliferation rather than from pruning exclusively.
The ability to recognize faces, which is critical for everyday social interactions, improves 
from childhood to adulthood. This improvement depends on functional development of face-

 selective regions in the fusiform gyrus (1–3). Understanding how anatomical changes co-
occur with cortical functional development has implications for understanding normative 
and atypical development. However, if and how the cortical tissue of high-level visual cortex 
changes across development and the functional significance of these changes remain 
unknown. Because the fusiform gyrus is a hominoid-specific structure, this question can 
only be answered by obtaining measurements of structure, function, and behavior in awake, 
behaving humans.
Recent advances in quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) (4, 5) enabled us to 
quantify and compare between individuals the amount of brain tissue within a voxel (the 
region of a tissue slice that corresponds to a pixel in the MRI image), referred to as the 
macromolecular and lipid tissue volume (MTV), as well as the composition of the tissue, 
such as the lipid and cholesterol content of cell walls and myelin, as measured by proton 
relaxation time (T1). These measurements can disambiguate developmental hypotheses (fig. 
S1) to test if, during childhood, macromolecular tissue (i) is pruned (6), predicting lower 
MTV and longer T1 in adults than children; (ii) proliferates (7), predicting higher MTV and 
shorter T1 in adults than children; or (iii) remains stable.
In 22 children (between 5 and 12 years of age) and 25 adults (between 22 and 28 years of 
age), we combined measurements of functional MRI (fMRI; 2.4 mm isotropic voxels, 
repetition time (TR) = 1 s, multiplex factor = 3), qMRI (1 mm isotropic voxels; four spoiled 
gradient echo scans using flip angles of 4°, 10°, 20°, and 30°), and visual recognition 
memory (supplementary materials and methods). Using fMRI, we identified functional 
regions of interest (fROIs) in each subject’s ventral temporal cortex (VTC) selective for 
faces in the posterior and mid fusiform gyrus (pFus-and mFus-faces, respectively) and for 
places in the collateral sulcus (CoS-places) (Fig. 1A). Using qMRI, we obtained maps of T1 
and MTV in each individual. Subsequent analyses focused on T1 because it is sensitive to 
both MTV (higher MTV quickens proton lattice exchange, lowering T1; fig. S2) and tissue 
composition (for example, membranes that contain cholesterol impact T1 more than 
membranes that do not).
The T1 of face-and place-selective regions in the right hemisphere demonstrated differential 
development of cortical tissue. Mean T1 in pFus-faces, but not CoS-places [t40 = 2.2, not 
significant (n.s.), Bonferroni corrected], was significantly lower in adults than in children 
(t38 = 4.34, P < 10−4, Bonferroni corrected; Fig. 1, B and C). Results were replicated in a 
control analysis in which fROI size was matched across children and adults (t38 = 4.24, P < 
0.001). A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of mean T1 with factors of age group, 
fROI, and hemisphere revealed a significant age group-by-fROI interaction (F1,163 = 9.71, P 
< 0.005), as well as significant main effects of age group and hemisphere (Fs > 9.86, Ps < 
0.005, where Fs and Ps indicate F and P values from multiple statistical tests). Likewise, the 
voxelwise distribution of T1 across right pFus-faces was lower in adults compared to 
children (Fig. 1B), but there was no development of the voxelwise T1 distribution in CoS-
places bilaterally (Fig. 1C and fig. S4A). Mean and voxelwise distributions of T1 in left 
pFus-faces (fig. S4A) and mFus-faces (fig. S5A) were also lower in adults, but 
developmental effects were smaller. MTV also showed differential developmental trends, 
numerically increasing in pFus-faces and remaining stable in CoS-places (fig. S3, A and D).

 Critically, T1 development was not correlated with cortical curvature (fig. S6) or cortical 
thickness across age group or fROIs (fig. S7).
We next tested if functional selectivity in pFus-faces and CoS-places was related to T1 
(supplementary materials and methods). In right pFus-faces, mean face selectivity was 
significantly and negatively correlated with mean T1 (r40 = −0.51, where r is the correlation 
coefficient; P < 0.001; Bonferroni corrected; Fig. 2A). This relationship was replicated in a 
control analysis in which fROI size was matched across children and adults (r40 = −0.5, P < 
0.001). After regressing out participants’ ages, the relationship between functional 
selectivity and T1 remained significant at P = 0.01 (Fig. 2A, inset). The correlation between 
functional selectivity and T1 in pFus-faces was category specific, as mean selectivity for the 
nonpreferred category of places in right pFus-faces was not correlated with mean T1 (r40 = 
−0.0), n.s.). In right CoS-places, where we observed no developmental change in T1, there 
was no significant correlation between place selectivity and T1 (r42 = −0.27, n.s.; Fig. 2B). 
Additionally, there were no significant correlations between selectivity for the preferred 
category and T1 in left CoS-places, left pFus-faces, and mFus-faces bilaterally (figs. S4B 
and S5B). Correlations between selectivity and MTV were also not significant (fig. S3, B 
and E).
We also tested if face and place recognition memory were correlated with T1 or functional 
selectivity in particular fROIs (supplementary materials and methods). Face recognition 
memory was significantly and negatively correlated with T1 in right pFus-faces (r36 = −0.47, 
P = 0.003, Bonferroni corrected; Fig. 2C). This relationship remained significant when 
controlling for floor and ceiling performance (r29 = −0.61, P < 0.0005) and when 
additionally regressing out subject age (P < 0.05; Fig. 2C, inset). This correlation was 
category-specific; place recognition memory was not significantly correlated with T1 of 
pFus-faces (r37 = 0.18, n.s.). Further, the correlation between face recognition and T1 of 
pFus-faces was significantly different from the correlation between place recognition and T1 
of CoS-places (Fisher difference, P = 0.003). Other face-selective fROIs on the mid fusiform 
and in the left hemisphere showed similar relationships to behavior, but were not significant 
after Bonferroni correction (figs. S3C, S4C, and S5C).
This correlation between recognition memory and tissue properties was unique to face-
selective cortex, as T1 in CoS-places was not significantly correlated with either place (r42 = 
0.24, n.s.; Fig. 2D) or face recognition (r41 = −0.32, n.s.). Additionally, T1 in character-
selective regions that abut face-selective regions decreased from childhood to adulthood (ts > 
2.38, where ts indicates t values from multiple t-tests; Ps < 0.02; fig. S8), with stronger 
development in the left hemisphere (supplementary materials and methods). However, this 
development was not significantly correlated with face recognition (r35 = −0.33, n.s.; fig. 
S8A).
We tested if face selectivity in pFus-faces could also account for face recognition memory. 
Face recognition was significantly positively correlated with face selectivity in right pFus-
faces (r36 = 0.45, P = 0.006), but it was not significant when age was partialled out (P = 
0.11). A multivariate regression relating recognition to both selectivity and T1 in pFus-faces 
revealed only a 1.1% increase in explained variance when selectivity was added with T1.

 The developmental decrease of T1 in face-selective cortex suggests a mechanism of 
microstructural proliferation. The question remains as to what tissue changes underlie the 
observed T1 changes. We hypothesized that T1 development is associated with changes to 
multiple tissue compartments, including increases in cell bodies, dendritic structures, and 
myelin sheath. Although we could not measure them directly in vivo, we assessed the 
contribution of different tissue compartments to empirical observations by comparing qMRI 
measurements to cytoarchitecture in cell body-stained sections of postmortem brains and to 
simulations of increases in myelination.
Our in vivo data indicated that in children, pFus-faces and CoS-places had nondifferentiated 
T1 properties (Fig. 3A), but in adults, pFus-faces had lower T1 than CoS-places (Fig. 3B). 
Thus, we reasoned that if development leads to anatomical differences between pFus-faces 
and CoS-places, then these differences should be observable in ex vivo histological 
measurements of adult VTC (8,9). Notably, pFus-faces and CoS-places are cyto-
architectonically dissociable, where the former is largely confined to fusiform gyrus 
cytoarchitectonic area FG2 and the latter to FG3 (10). Using cortex-based alignment (11), 
we generated maximum probability maps (MPMs) of fROIs from 20 living adults and 
cytoarchitectonic regions of interest (cROIs) from 10 postmortem adults and compared them 
on the FreeSurfer average brain (supplementary materials and methods). Mirroring previous 
work (10), pFus-faces was largely within FG2, and CoS-places was largely within FG3 (Fig. 
3C). Extracting T1 measurements of living adults from the regions corresponding to the 
MPM of FG2 and FG3 showed significantly lower T1 in FG2 compared to FG3 (Fig. 3D).
We compared these T1 measurements from MPMs of FG2 and FG3 to the volume fraction 
of cell bodies across cortical layers of areas FG2 and FG3 measured by the mean gray level 
index (GLI) (8, 9) from 20-μm histological sections (supplementary materials and methods). 
The mean GLI of FG3 was 12.73 ± 1.29, which was significantly larger (pairwise t test, P < 
0.05) than the mean GLI of FG2 (11.65 ± 1.83, Fig. 3D). A smaller GLI in FG2 
corresponded to a larger amount of neuropil, which is the space surrounding the cell bodies 
that contains synapses, dendrites, axons with or without myelin, and glial and astrocytic 
processes. Assuming all other conditions were the same, more abundant neuropil in FG2 
would manifest as lower T1 in qMRI.
One neuropil compartment that may develop is myelin. Increased myelination of axons in 
deep cortical layers could push the white-gray matter boundary into cortex, predicting 
thinner FG2-pFus-faces than FG3-CoS-places in adulthood. Contrary to this prediction, both 
postmortem and in vivo FG2 and pFus-faces tended to be thicker than FG3 and CoS-places 
(fig. S7, G and H). Cortical thickness estimates were the same for cell body and myelin 
staining of FG2, suggesting that deep cortical layers were likely not misclassified as white 
matter in MRI (fig. S7, A and B). Although FG2 and FG3 were similarly myelinated in 
postmortem adults (fig. S7, C to F), myelin could increase within the cortex across 
development. Since myelin volume linearly contributes to MTV and mean MTV in pFus-
faces voxels increased by 12.6% from childhood to adulthood, we simulated the amount by 
which the volume of the myelin sheath would need to increase in order to account for these 
observations (supplementary materials and methods). Simulations using various ranges of 
axonal radii and percentages of axons myelinated showed that the radius of the myelin

 sheath would need to increase 2-to 10-fold to account for the development of MTV in pFus-
faces (Fig. 3E). We believe that such an increase is anatomically infeasible because it would 
result in fibers that are composed largely of myelin sheath.
Together, the histological measurements and the simulations suggest that development of T1 
in pFus-faces may be driven by microstructural proliferation in a combination of cortical 
compartments. One such compartment may be dendrites. Our data are consistent with 
research in monkey inferotemporal cortex, which is the proposed homolog of human VTC, 
where anatomical development is characterized by a prolific generation of dendritic spines 
and a doubling in size of dendritic arbors (7). The growth of dendritic arbors may impact the 
spatial extent from which pyramidal neurons pool information (13, 14) and the spatial extent 
of lateral inhibition (12), both of which could enhance functional selectivity. Another source 
of tissue development may be developmental increases in oligodendrocytes and myelination 
(15–17), which are thought to depend on neural function (18). Although myelination is a 
likely source of T1 change, simulation results suggest that it is likely not the only source. 
Other contributions to T1 development may arise from changes in perineuronal iron-protein 
matrices (19) or glial and astrocytic structural changes observed during learning in adults 
(20).
Overall, these data suggest a rethinking of the anatomical development of cortex throughout 
childhood. First, we found a differential development of VTC; some regions showed 
profound changes, while others remained stable. Second, we found evidence for 
microstructural proliferation in the fusiform gyrus during childhood, which implicates a 
different mechanism than the pruning that occurs during infant development (6). These 
findings suggest that improvements in behavior are a product of an interplay between 
structural and functional changes in cortex.
