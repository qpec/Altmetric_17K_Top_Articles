ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest type of brain tumor, and glioma
stem cells (GSCs) contribute to tumor recurrence and therapeutic resistance. Thus,
an oncolytic virus targeting GSCs may be useful for improving GBM treatment. Be-
cause Zika virus (ZIKV) has an oncolytic tropism for infecting GSCs, we investigated
the safety and efficacy of a live attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidate (ZIKV-LAV) for the
treatment of human GBM in a GSC-derived orthotopic model. Intracerebral injection
of ZIKV-LAV into mice caused no neurological symptoms or behavioral abnormali-
ties. The neurovirulence of ZIKV-LAV was more attenuated than that of the licensed
Japanese encephalitis virus LAV 14-14-2, underlining the superior safety of ZIKV-LAV
for potential GBM treatment. Importantly, ZIKV-LAV significantly reduced intracere-
bral tumor growth and prolonged animal survival by selectively killing GSCs within
the tumor. Mechanistically, ZIKV infection elicited antiviral immunity, inflammation,
and GSC apoptosis. Together, these results further support the clinical development
of ZIKV-LAV for GBM therapy.
IMPORTANCE Glioblastoma (GBM), the deadliest type of brain tumor, is currently in-
curable because of its high recurrence rate after traditional treatments, including
surgery to remove the main part of the tumor and radiation and chemotherapy to
target residual tumor cells. These treatments fail mainly due to the presence of a
cell subpopulation called glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are resistant to radiation
and chemotherapy and capable of self-renewal and tumorigenicity. Because Zika vi-
rus (ZIKV) has an oncolytic tropism for infecting GSCs, we tested a live attenuated
ZIKV vaccine candidate (ZIKV-LAV) for the treatment of human GBM in a human
GSC-derived orthotopic model. Our results showed that ZIKV-LAV retained good effi-
cacy against glioblastoma by selectively killing GSCs within the tumor. In addition,
ZIKV-LAV exhibited an excellent safety profile upon intracerebral injection into the
treated animals. The good balance between the safety of ZIKV-LAV and its efficacy
against human GSCs suggests that it is a potential candidate for combination with
the current treatment regimen for GBM therapy.

 Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the
genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae. Like ZIKV, many flaviviruses, including
dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese enceph-
alitis virus (JEV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), are significant human patho-
gens. The recent epidemics of ZIKV in the Americas have caused a global public health
emergency because of its unexpected causal link to microcephaly and other congenital
diseases in fetuses from infected pregnant women (1–4). ZIKV preferentially infects
neural progenitor cells (NPCs), causing cell death and reduced proliferation, which
results in impaired brain development in the fetus (5, 6). In response to the public
health emergency, the scientific community has rapidly developed a number of prom-
ising ZIKV vaccines with good safety and efficacy profiles in mice and nonhuman
primates, and some of the vaccines have already entered phase I/II clinical trials (7, 8).
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant form of primary brain
tumor, and despite aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy,
GBM remains lethal, with a median survival time of less than 2 years (9, 10). Thus, novel
treatment options are urgently needed. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have self-renewal,
tumorigenic and differentiation potential, and are thus similar to NPCs in that respect.
GSCs play critical roles in GBM progression, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance and
have been well recognized as a major therapeutic target for GBM (11–13). Oncolytic
viruses are emerging as promising therapeutic options, and multiple versions of
oncolytic viruses have been explored for virotherapy against human GBM, with prom-
ising results (14). Treatment of grade IV malignant glioma patients with a recombinant
polyrhinovirus chimera was recently shown to improve their survival rates (15).
The specific tropism of ZIKV for NPCs in the fetus has raised the possibility of its use
as an oncolytic virus to target GSCs. Zhu et al. recently demonstrated that ZIKV was
highly efficient at infecting and killing human GSCs in vitro. Treatment with a mouse-
adapted ZIKV Dakar strain led to a regression of mouse glioma and prolonged the
survival of mice engrafted with glioblastoma cells (16). However, whether ZIKV is
efficacious for treating patient-derived GBM remains to be determined. Such in vivo
efficacy is required before ZIKV can progress into the clinic as a virotherapy against
human GBM.
With respect to its potential use as a therapeutic agent, the pathological diseases
associated with intracerebral injection of ZIKV into the brain have raised safety con-
cerns. One approach to addressing this safety barrier is to engineer ZIKV in a manner
that eliminates its virulence but maintains its oncolytic activity against GBM. Along
these lines, we have recently developed a genetically modified live attenuated ZIKV
vaccine (ZIKV-LAV) that contains a 10-nucleotide deletion in the 3= untranslated region
(3=UTR) of the viral genome (17). The genetic stability and safety profile of ZIKV-LAV
have been well characterized in mice and nonhuman primates (18). The goals of this
study were to (i) profile the safety of ZIKV-LAV for intracerebral injection, (ii) evaluate
the in vivo efficacy of ZIKV-LAV against GBM in a patient-derived GSC orthotopic mouse
model, and (iii) define the oncolytic mechanism of ZIKV-LAV during GBM treatment.
RESULTS
Intracerebral administration of ZIKV-LAV is safe in multiple mouse models. We
previously showed that ZIKV-LAV was highly attenuated in newborn CD-1 mice upon
intracerebral injection even at a dose of 10,000 PFU; no morbidity or mortality was
detected in any of the infected mice (17). To further examine the neurovirulence safety,
we intracranially injected 10,000 PFU of ZIKV-LAV (derived from preepidemic Cambo-
dian strain FSS 13025) and wild-type ZIKV (the epidemic GZ01 strain isolated in China
from an imported human patient in 2016) into 3-week-old BALB/c nude mice. As a
positive control, we also infected the mice with the same dose of a clinically licensed
JEV-LAV that has been used in more than 400 million children under the age of 15 years
in China (19). As expected, all the nude mice succumbed to the wild-type ZIKV infection
within 25 days, exhibiting typical neurological symptoms and body weight loss; even
administration of the licensed JEV-LAV resulted in neurovirulence in the nude mice

 (Fig. 1A; see also Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). In contrast, ZIKV-LAV did not
cause any morbidity, mortality, or weight loss in the infected animals (Fig. 1A; see also
Fig. S1A). Interestingly, both wild-type ZIKV and ZIKV-LAV showed tropism for the brain,
and viral RNA accumulation was observed in the brains of the infected mice until
18 days postinjection, whereas no viral RNAs were detected in the serum or in other
tested peripheral organs, including the heart, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney (Fig. 1B). In
addition, no pathological changes were observed in the brains of ZIKV-LAV-injected
mice by histopathological examination (Fig. S1B). However, the pathological outcomes
may have been affected by limited inflammation in the nude mice due to the lack of
T cells. Sequencing the viruses recovered from the mouse brains on day 24 postinjec-
tion confirmed the retention of the 10-nucleotide deletion in the 3=UTR of the viral
genome (Fig. S1C).
A recent study demonstrated that ZIKV infection could cause behavioral abnormal-
ities in multiple animal models (20). To further evaluate the neurovirulence of ZIKV-LAV,
we performed four sets of behavioral tests to examine the potential adverse effects on
ZIKV-LAV-infected mice, including the standard open field test (Fig. 1C to F), tail
suspension test (Fig. 1G), elevated plus maze test (Fig. 1H to J), and rota-rod test
(Fig. 1K). Four-week-old C57 mice were intracranially injected with 10,000 PFU of

 ZIKV-LAV, and all the infected animals remained healthy without any symptoms or
behavioral abnormalities (e.g., diarrhea, inappetence, depression, inactivity, and self-
injury) during the observation period. The ZIKV-LAV-infected animals showed anxiety
levels and motor functions similar to those of animals in the mock control group
(P � 0.05) during the four behavior tests (Fig. 1C to K). Collectively, these results
showed that the intracerebral administration of ZIKV-LAV to mice did not cause
detectable behavioral abnormalities, neurovirulence, or virus spillover to other organs,
suggesting an excellent safety profile for ZIKV-LAV during oncolytic virotherapy.
ZIKV-LAV impairs GBM formation and prolongs animal survival. The excellent
safety profile of ZIKV-LAV prompted us to test its therapeutic efficacy against human
GBM in a GSC-derived orthotopic mouse model (21–23). These GSCs have been
functionally validated in previous studies and shown to form orthotopic xenografts in
mice that closely resemble the genotype and phenotype of human GBM (21, 24, 25).
Two GSC lines (387 GSCs and 4121 GSCs) that stably express firefly luciferase were
co-implanted with ZIKV-LAV (26); we chose to transplant a mixture of GSCs (50,000
cells) and ZIKV-LAV (10,000 PFU) to mimic clinical treatment. After removal of the main
tumor by surgery, residual GSCs may remain in proximity to the original resection
cavity. Bioluminescence imaging showed that brain tumors progressed rapidly in
animals implanted with 387 GSCs (Fig. 2A and B) and 4121 GSCs (Fig. S2A and B)
following implantation, and all animals exhibited neurological symptoms and died
(Fig. 2C). In contrast, co-implantation with ZIKV-LAV significantly delayed tumor growth
and progression (Fig. 2A and B; see also Fig. S2A and B). In addition, the co-implantation
with ZIKV-LAV also increased the median survival duration from 30 days to 48 days for
the 387 GSC-implanted mice (Fig. 2C) and from 31 days to 53 days for the 4121
GSC-implanted animals (Fig. S2C).
Histological examination of brain sections by hematoxylin and eosin staining con-
firmed that all the tested GSC-implanted animals (n � 8) had developed typical invasive
gliomas on day 23 postimplantation with 387 GSCs and on day 25 postimplantation
with 4121 GSCs. In contrast, visible tumors were observed in only a small proportion (2
of 8) of ZIKV-LAV-treated animals, and the tumor sizes were significantly reduced
(Fig. 2D; see also Fig. S2D). As expected, immunofluorescence staining showed high
percentages of SOX2-positive (SOX2�) and Olig2� tumor cells (stem cell markers)
within tumor tissues from the mock infection group (Fig. 2E; see also Fig. S3A, bottom
panels), whereas the proportions of SOX2� and Olig2� glioma cells were significantly
lower in tumor tissues from the ZIKV-LAV-treated mice (Fig. 2E; see also Fig. S3A, top
panels). The ZIKV E protein was clearly detected in tumor tissues from the ZIKV-LAV-
administered mouse brain but was not frequently detected in normal brain tissue or
glioma tissue from animals in the mock infection group (Fig. 2E; see also Fig. S3A).
To examine whether the decrease in GSC populations was due to increased cell
death, we performed cleaved caspase 3 (Cas3) staining and terminal deoxynucleo-
tidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays on the brain
tumor sections. More-extensive apoptosis was induced in the ZIKV-LAV-inoculated mice
than in the animals receiving mock treatment (Fig. 2F; see also Fig. S3C). Altogether,
these results suggest that ZIKV-LAV eliminates GSCs and their development into human
GBM by inducing extensive apoptosis in an orthotopic mouse model.
ZIKV-LAV has tumoricidal activity in GBM bulk cells. To further determine the ex
vivo tumoricidal activity of ZIKV-LAV, GBM bulk cells were isolated from 387 GSC-
implanted mice and subjected to ZIKV-LAV infection. Immunostaining was performed
on day 3 postinfection, and ZIKV preferentially infected the Olig2� bulk tumor cells
(Fig. 3A). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed that ZIKV-LAV effec-
tively replicated in bulk tumor cells, peaking on day 3 postinfection (Fig. 3B). Cell
viability assays showed that ZIKV-LAV infection exerted direct oncolytic effects on GBM
bulk cells (Fig. 3C).
ZIKV-LAV preferentially infects and kills GSCs. It was previously shown that

We found that approximately 60% of the SOX2� 387 GSCs and 70% of the SOX2� 4121

 infected by ZIKV-LAV in their corresponding DGCs (Fig. 4A; see also Fig. S4A). ZIKV-LAV
genomic RNA accumulated within 3 days postinfection in both 387 GSCs and 4121
GSCs, whereas no significant increase in viral RNA levels was observed in the infected
DGCs (Fig. 4B; see also Fig. S4B). In addition, a flow cytometry assay showed that
ZIKV-LAV infection induced extensive cell apoptosis (as revealed by staining with
annexin V) in GSCs (Fig. 4C; see also Fig. S4C). Furthermore, standard cell viability and
tumorsphere formation assays showed that ZIKV-LAV inhibited GSC growth in a dose-
responsive manner (Fig. 4D; see also Fig. S4D) and suppressed GSC tumorsphere
formation (Fig. 4E; see also Fig. S4E). These in vitro results, together with the in vivo and
ex vivo results described above, demonstrate that ZIKV-LAV retains a tropism for GSCs
and tumoricidal ability similar to that of wild-type ZIKV.
ZIKV infection triggers antiviral immunity and inflammation in GSCs. To reveal
the underlying oncolytic mechanisms of ZIKV-LAV, we analyzed the global transcrip-
tomic response in ZIKV-infected 4121 GSCs using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq).
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathway analysis showed that ZIKV infection
triggered strong antiviral immunity and inflammation responses, including the inter-
feron (IFN), NF-�B, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways (Fig. S5 and S6).
These results are consistent with previous findings reported by Chen and coworkers
(27). The relative gene expression levels of multiple DEGs from the cell cycle, p53,
apoptosis, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathways, which are
related to cell differentiation, proliferation, or cell death, were significantly upregulated
in ZIKV-infected 4121 GSCs (Fig. 5). We further validated the RNA-seq data by RT-qPCR.
Selected genes blocking cell growth (DDIT3, GADD45B, and CDKN2B) were significantly
upregulated by ZIKV infection (Fig. S6D). Interestingly, ZIKV infection dramatically
upregulated gamma interferon (IFN-�)-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES and
downregulated MCP-1 (Fig. 6A). In agreement with the result described above, the
multiple-cytokine Luminex assay showed that ZIKV infection significantly enhanced the
production of IP-10 and RANTES and reduced the production of MCP-1 in GSCs (Fig. 6B;

 see also Fig. S7). These results indicate that specific cytokine responses and interferon
signaling collectively contribute to the oncolytic effects of ZIKV in GSCs.
DISCUSSION
A recent study demonstrated that ZIKV had oncolytic activity against GBM in a
mouse glioma model (16). However, applying this oncolytic virotherapy to clinical
treatment requires two major improvements. First, wild-type ZIKV needs to be modified
such that its neurovirulence is reduced to ensure its safety in treating glioma patients.
Second, the modified safe ZIKV should retain its tropism and oncolytic activity against
glioma cells. In this study, we demonstrated that a rationally engineered live attenuated
ZIKV vaccine candidate in which a 10-nucleotide region is deleted from the 3=UTR of

 the viral genome was safe when intracerebrally injected into the mouse brain, as
indicated by the absence of disease, histopathology, or behavioral abnormalities.
Importantly, treatment with ZIKV-LAV potently killed human GSCs in vitro, eliminated
the development of GSCs into glioma in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, and
prolonged the survival of animals. It should be noted that, compared with a recent
study (16), the current study used (i) a well-developed ZIKV vaccine candidate that is
currently transitioning into clinical development (7) and (ii) a human GSC orthotopic
xenograft mouse model to demonstrate its efficacy.
A common strategy to ensure the safety of oncolytic viruses is to adopt vaccine
strains by taking advantage of their attenuated nature. On the basis of this idea, three
oncolytic virus platforms, i.e., measles virus vaccine strain Edmonston B, poliovirus
vaccine strain Sabin, and several vaccinia virus vaccine strains, have entered clinical
trials (14). Recombinant poliovirus containing the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)

of 1-day-old CD-1 mice with the vaccine candidate by intracranial injection was safe

decreased level of viral RNA synthesis and increased sensitivity to type I interferon

flavivirus vaccines). In this study, we further evaluated its safety from other aspects. Like
the test in CD-1 mice, intracranial inoculation of 3-week-old BALB/c nude mice with
10,000 PFU of ZIKV-LAV caused no mortality and even no weight loss, whereas infection
with the same dose of wild-type ZIKV was lethal. Although limited viral replication was
observed in brains inoculated with ZIKV-LAV, no pathological damage was observed in
the mouse brains, and assays showed that the virus did not invade other organs or
cause viremia at days 6 to 18 posttreatment. These results suggest that the attenuated
virus may be incapable of shedding from the inoculated animals into the environment
or infecting bystanders (e.g., via sexual transmission), providing a safety feature for
treated individuals and the public. However, we could not exclude the possibility that
early viremia may have occurred but had been cleared by day 6 posttreatment.
Furthermore, the performances of C57 mice intracranially inoculated with ZIKV-LAV or
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) during behavioral evaluations, including the open field
test, tail suspension test, elevated plus maze test, and rota-rod test, were not different.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that ZIKV-LAV has an excellent safety profile
and is thus a potential virotherapeutic agent for GBM patients.
An oncolytic virus must display a fine balance between efficacy and safety to be
successful. To determine whether the virus retains oncolytic activity after being atten-
uated, we mixed patient-derived GSCs with ZIKV-LAV or RPMI 1640 and then trans-
planted the mixture into the brains of BALB/c nude mice. Note that because patient-
derived GSCs maintain patient-specific genetic and phenotypic alterations, the
evaluation of oncolytic efficiency with GBM models constructed using patient-derived
GSCs in the current study represents a step closer to the treatment of human GBM than
the mouse glioma models reported by Zhu and colleagues (16). The results of trans-
plantation of the premixture of ZIKV-LAV and GSCs resemble the prevention of GBM
recurrence in the clinical setting, during which the main part of the tumor is removed
by surgical resection first and then temozolomide chemotherapy and radiation are
applied to eliminate residual tumor cells (28, 29). Using this model, we found that the
ZIKV-LAV-treated mice survived longer than the untreated mice, demonstrating that
ZIKV-LAV retains its oncolytic activity against patient-derived GSCs in vivo.
To reveal the mechanism underlying the observed oncolytic activity, we analyzed
the transcription profiles of mock-infected and ZIKV-infected GSCs. DEG assays and
pathway analysis showed that ZIKV infection triggered strong activation of the TNF
signaling pathway (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material) and upregulated the
expression of several cytokines, including IP-10 (CXCL10). These results were further
corroborated by the cytokine Luminex assay data. IP-10/CXCL10 can recruit CXCR3� T
cells, including CD8� T cells, which are important for the control of tumor growth, via
the CXCR3 receptor expressed on activated T cells (30). Nishimura et al. also reported
that IP-10 plays a critical role in the homing of Tc1 into the central nervous system to
inhibit tumors (31), and IP-10 has been shown to inhibit tumoral angiogenesis (32).
Thus, ZIKV-LAV treatment may lead not only to direct cell death but also to the
activation of antitumor immunity in vivo. Because our current model was built in BALB/c
nude mice, which are T cell deficient, the oncolytic efficiency contributed by T cell
immunity could not be revealed. Therefore, a patient-derived GSC glioma model in
more highly immunocompetent mice is needed to better reveal the oncolytic efficiency
of ZIKV-LAV. However, one limitation of the mouse model used here is that because the
GSCs used are of human origin, ZIKV-LAV may spread differently to normal mouse
tissue (i.e., mouse brain) than to human tissue (i.e., spread from human tumor to human
normal brain tissue) during tumor treatment.

 In summary, the current report represents major progress toward the development
of ZIKV as a novel virotherapeutic candidate for the treatment of human GBM. We
demonstrated that a live attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidate has the excellent safety
profile required for cerebral virotherapy and retains potent oncolytic efficacy in glioma
models built with patient-derived GSCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines. GSCs (specimens 387 and 4121) were originally isolated and characterized from human
GBM surgical specimens as previously described (26) and cultured as neurospheres in neurobasal
complete media (Gibco) supplemented with 1� B27 (Gibco) (without vitamin A), 2 mM L-GLUTAMINE
(MacGene), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (MacGene), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (R&D Systems),
and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (R&D Systems). DGCs were differentiated from GSCs via the
withdrawal of epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor and addition of 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; MacGene). DGCs were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (MacGene) contain-
ing 10% FBS. Expression of the GSC marker SOX2/Olig2 and the differentiation marker GFAP was
characterized using Western blotting or immunofluorescence staining. All cells were incubated at 37°
C
in a humidified incubator supplemented with 5% CO2.
Viruses. The wild-type ZIKV strain used in this study was originally isolated by our laboratory from
a Chinese patient returning from Venezuela in 2016 (33). The live attenuated vaccine strain of ZIKV
(ZIKV-LAV) was generated by reverse genetic technology, and the characterization of ZIKV-LAV was
described previously (17). The JEV-LAV used in this study was obtained from Chengdu Institute of
Biological Products (China).
Mouse experiments. The mouse strains used in this study included BALB/c nude mice (3 weeks old,
female) and C57 mice (4 weeks old, female); both mouse strains were purchased from Beijing Vital River
Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment
Committee of Laboratory Animal Center, AMMS, China (IACUC-13-2016-001).
Safety evaluation of ZIKV-LAV in mice. For the survival and weight change study, groups of BALB/c
nude mice were intracerebrally inoculated with 10,000 PFU of ZIKV-LAV, JEV-LAV, or ZIKV. PBS injection
was used as a control. Mice were weighed and monitored daily to assess body weight changes and
mortality.
To study the tissue distribution of ZIKV-LAV and ZIKV, sera and major tissues (including brains, livers,
spleens, kidneys, hearts, and lungs) of mice intracerebrally inoculated with ZIKV-LAV (10,000 PFU/mouse)
or ZIKV (10,000 PFU/mouse) were harvested on days 6, 12, and 18 after infection (n � 3 per time point)
for the detection of viral RNA by RT-qPCR. The primers and probe used in this study were described
previously (34).
For histological examination, the brains of BALB/c nude mice intracerebrally inoculated with 10,000
PFU of ZIKV-LAV or PBS were harvested on day 7 after inoculation and then prepared into 8-�m-thick
paraffin sections. The paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Behavioral evaluations of mice infected with ZIKV-LAV. Groups of C57 mice were inoculated with
ZIKV-LAV (10,000 PFU per mouse) or PBS via an intracerebral route. On day 14 postinoculation, the open
field, tail suspension, rota-rod, and elevated plus maze tests were performed accordingly.
For the open field test, each mouse was placed in the center of a darkened white box (30 by 30
by 40 cm) and monitored using an infrared video tracking system (Ethovision XT 9.0; Noldus Information
Technology) for 5 min. A 15-by-15-cm square in the center of the box was defined as the “zone,” and the
peripheral arena was defined as the “residual.” The distance traveled and time spent in the zone and
residual were recorded for further analysis.
For the tail suspension test, animals were suspended 50 cm above the floor by hanging approxi-
mately 1 cm from the tip of their tail. The time that the mice remained immobile was quantified during
a test period of 6 min. Mice were considered immobile only when they hung passively and stayed
completely motionless. A camera was mounted facing the tail suspension test arena, and all the test
events were recorded. Two experienced observers independently scored the behavior, and an average
of the two scores was used as the final score.
For the elevated plus maze test, the structure used was a “plus”-shaped maze elevated 60 cm above
the floor that consists of two closed arms surrounded by nontransparent walls (20 cm in height) and two
open arms (5 by 35 cm). Each mouse was placed in the center (5 by 5 cm) of the maze, facing one of the
closed arms. During the 5-min test period, the movement of the mouse was recorded by video capture
software (Anymaze). The total number of entrances into the open arms and the amount of time spent
in the open arms were quantified.
For the rota-rod test, each mouse was placed on a rotating spindle that accelerated from 4 rpm to
40 rpm within 5 min and remained at 40 rpm for one additional minute. All animals were subjected to
one session per day for 3 days, and the amount of time spent on the rod was recorded for quantitative
analysis.
Construction of the GBM orthotopic xenograft model using patient-derived GSCs. A total of
50,000 luciferase-labeled GSCs (type 387 or 4121) were co-implanted with 10,000 PFU of ZIKV-LAV or
RPMI 1640 intracerebrally into the right frontal lobe of a nude mouse. After implantation, biolumines-
cence imaging was performed using a charge-coupled-device camera (Xenogen Corp., Alameda, CA,
USA) at the indicated time points as described previously (35). Briefly, 1.5 mg of the substrate D-LUCIFERIN
sodium salt (Gold Biotechnology) was administered intraperitoneally to each mouse, and images were
acquired 9 min later for 60 s. To quantify the amount of light emitted from the tumor, regions of interest

 (ROIs) were manually defined after imaging, and the photon flux was calculated (in photons/second/
square centimeter/steradian) using Living Image 3.0 (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, CA, USA). For
experiments assessing survival, mice were monitored until the last mouse showed neurological signs.
When any mouse showed neurological signs, selected mouse brains were harvested and prepared in
5-�m-thick cryosections. The cryosections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and subjected to
histological examination.
Immunofluorescence staining of brain tissues. Brain cryosections were incubated with a primary
mouse anti-ZIKV E protein antibody (Abcam) (1:500 dilution), goat anti-SOX2 antibody (R&D) (1:500
dilution), or goat anti-Olig2 antibody (R&D) (1:50 dilution) overnight at 4°
C. The sections were then
incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse and 594-conjugated anti-goat secondary anti-
bodies (Thermo Fisher) (1:300 dilution) for 2 h at 37°
C. Finally, the sections were incubated with DAPI
(4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (1:1,000 dilution) for 10 min. Images were acquired by confocal laser
scanning microscopy (Zeiss).
Assessment of apoptosis in tumor tissues. Apoptosis in tumor tissue was detected by cleaved
caspase 3 staining and a DeadEnd colorimetric TUNEL system kit (Promega). For cleaved caspase 3
staining, the brain cryosections were incubated with the primary mouse anti-ZIKV E protein antibody or
rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody (CST) (1:200 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse
and 594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) (1:300 dilution). Finally, the
sections were incubated with DAPI (1:1,000 dilution) for 10 min. A DeadEnd colorimetric TUNEL system
kit (Promega) was utilized according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Images were acquired by
confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss).
Bulk cell isolation. A total of 1 � 106 4121 GSCs were subcutaneously implanted into the flanks of
BALB/c nude mice. The xenografts were harvested 3 weeks after implantation, and the inner contents
were centrifuged for 3 min at a speed of 1,000 � g. Cells obtained by centrifugation were treated with
Accutase (Sigma) for 3 min. After being washed with PBS, bulk cells were cultured in Neurobasal
complete media and subjected to the following assays.
Viral titration and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Slides were placed in 24-well plates and then
covered with Matrigel (BD). Bulk cells, GSCs, or DGCs were seeded at a density of 1 � 105 cells per well.
After 24 h, the cells were infected with ZIKV-LAV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 h, and the
culture medium was then refreshed. At the indicated times, the supernatants were collected for virus
titration by RT-qPCR as described above. The bulk cells and GSCs were incubated with the same primary
and secondary antibodies used for the immunofluorescence analysis of the brain cryosections. The DGCs
were incubated with the mouse anti-ZIKV E protein (Abcam) (1:500 dilution) and rabbit anti-GFAP (Dako)
(1:500 dilution) primary antibodies overnight at 4°
C and then with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-
mouse and 594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) (1:300 dilution) for 2 h at
37°
C. The cells were subsequently incubated with DAPI (1:1,000 dilution) for 10 min. Images were
acquired by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss).
Cell death analysis by flow cytometry. GSCs were infected with ZIKV-LAV at an MOI of 1 and
collected at 48 and 72 h postinfection. Flow cytometry was performed with an annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (annexin V-FITC) apoptosis detection kit (Trevigen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. In brief, cells were washed in Neurobasal medium, and 1 � 105 cells were subsequently
resuspended in 100 �l of binding buffer and incubated with 5 �l of propidium iodide (PI) and 5 �l of
annexin V-FITC for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Flow cytometric analysis was immediately
performed using a flow cytometer (BD).
Cell viability and tumorsphere formation assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density
of 2,000 per well and subsequently infected with ZIKV-LAV at a dose of 200, 2,000, or 20,000 PFU per well.
Cell viability was evaluated on the indicated days after infection with a Cell Titer-Glo luminescent cell
viability assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The tumorspheres were
counted 5 days after infection.
RNA-seq data acquisition, quality control, and processing. GSCs were infected with ZIKV at an
MOI of 1, and total cellular RNA was extracted at 48 h postinfection with a PureLink RNA minikit (Life
Technologies). The RNA concentration was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher), and
the quality of the extracted RNA was evaluated using an Agilent Technology 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA
libraries were constructed using a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina) according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines. The quantities and qualities of the libraries were also assessed by the use of
the Qubit Fluorometer and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, respectively, and their molar concentrations were
validated by qPCR for library pooling. Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq X10 platform using the
paired-end 2 � 150-bp, dual-index format. For RNA-seq data analysis, first, trimmomatic was used to
remove Illumina sequencing adapters within the raw reads of every sample, trim the low-quality bases
of both read ends (with parameters LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15), and remove reads less
than 36 bp in length. Second, the clean reads were mapped to the human hg38 reference genome with
STAR, and the alignment bam files were used as an HTSeq-count (command of the python package
HTSeq) input to obtain the gene read counts. Finally, DESeq2 was used to identify DEGs (P � 0.05, fold
change [FC] � 2) based on raw read counts. For DEGs, KEGG pathway and gene ontology (GO) biological
process analyses were performed using Fisher’s exact test, and the enrichment P values were corrected
by the Bonferroni method.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and real-time qPCR. GSCs were infected with ZIKV at an MOI
of 1 in biological triplicate, and total cellular RNA was extracted at 48 h postinfection with a PureLink RNA
minikit (Life Technologies). cDNA was generated from 1 mg of RNA using an IScript reverse transcription
kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with random primers. qPCR analysis was
