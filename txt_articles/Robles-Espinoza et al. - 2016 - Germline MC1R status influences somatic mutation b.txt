The major genetic determinants of cutaneous melanoma risk in the general population
are disruptive variants (R alleles) in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. These alleles
are also linked to red hair, freckling, and sun sensitivity, all of which are known melanoma
phenotypic risk factors. Here we report that in melanomas and for somatic C4Tmutations, a
signature linked to sun exposure, the expected single-nucleotide variant count associated
with the presence of an R allele is estimated to be 42% (95% CI, 15–76%) higher than that
among persons without an R allele. This figure is comparable to the expected mutational
burden associated with an additional 21 years of age. We also find significant and similar
enrichment of non-C4T mutation classes supporting a role for additional mutagenic
processes in melanoma development in individuals carrying R alleles.

 M
elanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a G protein-coupled
receptor expressed on the surface of melanocytes
that signals to downstream effectors, such as the
microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, to regulate skin
pigmentation and to control cell proliferation and apoptosis1.
Melanin is generated by melanocytes in two major forms,
pheomelanin and eumelanin. Unlike eumelanin, which is dark
brown or black in colour, pheomelanin is red/orange, and
is associated with type I/II skin, freckles, red hair and an
inability to tan2. People with this phenotype are generally highly
photosensitive, and prone to sunburn when exposed to ultraviolet
(UV) light3.
Population sequencing studies have revealed a number of null
or hypomorphic MC1R alleles, which are collectively referred
to as R alleles and are strongly associated with the red hair
and light skin phenotype4,5. Other missense variants are referred
to as r alleles and are less strongly associated with this hair
colour and complexion4,6. While R/R individuals are generally
red heads, and persons with 0 or 1 R alleles are rarely red
heads, pigmentation traits such as degree of tanning after
repeated UV exposure3 and skin reflectance7 depend additively
on the number of R alleles. In addition to regulating skin
pigmentation,
MC1R
signalling
has
been
reported
to
increase phosphorylation of DNA repair proteins, initiating
the DNA damage repair process, and also to activate survival
pathways8–11. As such, polymorphisms in MC1R have been
linked to increased melanocyte apoptosis and inefficient DNA
repair12. Collectively these factors link MC1R variants to
increased melanoma risk6,13,14. In animal model systems, null
alleles of Mc1r (Mc1re/e) have been shown to co-operate with
BrafV600E to promote melanoma development via mechanisms
including enhanced lipid peroxidation, a phenotype rescued on
an albino mouse background owing to a lack of pheomelanin
production15. This has led to the suggestion that loss of
MC1R function, even in the absence of UV light, may
be oncogenic. Despite these insights, it is still unclear whether
MC1R germline variant alleles influence the genome-wide
somatic mutation burden in melanoma.
In this study, we set out to establish the contribution of germline
MC1R alleles to the somatic mutation landscape of sporadic
melanoma. Mutations found in melanomas are predominantly
C4T transitions due to the production of cyclobutane pyrimidine
dimers (CPDs) in response to solar UV damage, but other
mutational classes such as C4A transversions have also been
observed16–20. Indeed, hotspot mutations in key driver genes, such
as BRAF and KIT, are almost exclusively acquired as non-C4
T mutations17. Our results indicate that individuals with one or
two germline MC1R R alleles have a significantly higher somatic
mutational load than individuals with no R alleles. This finding
has implications for our understanding of melanomagenesis, as
well as the identification of individuals at higher risk of developing
melanoma.
Results
Samples. We analysed somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs)
from two independent melanoma cohorts: melanoma samples
from
The
Cancer
Genome
Atlas
(TCGA)
skin
cutaneous
melanoma (SKCM) collection21, and a data set from the Yale
Melanoma Genome Project22. We studied only cases with stated
ethnicity ‘white’ and with a histopathological diagnosis of
cutaneous melanoma (excluding acral and mucosal melanoma
which are not thought to be UV related). The TCGA data set
included 273 tumour/germline exome pairs (out of the total
collection of 343 samples), which comprised 43 from primary
tumours and 230 from metastases (all from different patients)
(Methods section, Supplementary Data 1 and 2). The Yale data set
was composed of 132 tumour/germline exome pairs, all of which
were from whites with a confirmed diagnosis of cutaneous
melanoma (28 primaries, 104 metastases) (Supplementary Data 3).
Variant calling and definition of SNV sets. To define MC1R
genotypes for each patient we analysed germline binary alignment/
map (BAM) files to identify and classify all non-synonymous and
nonsense variants as either R, r or wild-type alleles using the method
shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, and which is described in the
Methods section. Since MC1R disruptive variants segregate on
separate haplotypes, we assumed persons with two R alleles to be
homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. Sample numbers for each
MC1R genotype are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, with additional
details found in Supplementary Data 2 and 3, and Supplementary
Table 1. In the TCGA cohort, 23 (8%) individuals had two R alleles,
112 (41%) individuals had one R allele, and 138 (51%) individuals
had genotypes that were 0/0, r/0 or r/r (zero R alleles). In the Yale
data set, five (4%) individuals had two R alleles, 54 (41%) individuals
had 1 R allele, and 73 (55%) individuals had 0 R alleles.
We downloaded somatic variant calls from the TCGA that had
been previously generated by three pipelines; the Broad Institute
MuTect pipeline (version 119)23, the Baylor College of Medicine
CARNAC pipeline (version 1.0), and the bambam pipeline from
University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC; version 1.4). To
generate a stringent call set for downstream analysis, we selected
these previously generated SNVs that were agreed on by two or
three of these pipelines (Methods section, Supplementary Fig. 3).
Somatic variants from the Yale data set were generated as described
previously22. For our analysis we counted double and triple-
nucleotide variants separately as SNVs. These calls accounted for
an average of 4.9% of all somatic variants (range 0–18%).
Modelling somatic SNV burden against R allele presence. For
each of the six basic SNV classes (C4A, C4G, C4T, T4A,
T4C and T4G), we modelled the relationship between expected
somatic SNV burden and the presence of MC1R R alleles using
negative binomial regression (Methods section). For the TCGA
cohort, additional predictor variables were included to control for
age, sex, sample type (primary or metastasis), tissue collection
centre, body area, Breslow thickness, Clark’s level and ulceration
status (Methods section, Supplementary Data 2). Missing values
in these predictor variables (B12% of the data) were multiply
imputed (Methods section). The first three predictor variables
were available for the Yale data set (Supplementary Data 3), with
no missing information.
Figure 1a shows the distribution of the somatic SNV counts per
tumour in the TCGA melanoma cohort broken down by R allele
presence, and Supplementary Table 2 shows the results of the
negative binomial regression adjusted for the above-mentioned
eight clinical variables. Figure 1b and Supplementary Table 3
show the equivalent results for the Yale data set adjusted for the
three available clinical variables. For all six mutation types in
both data sets, there was evidence of an increased burden of
somatic SNVs in persons carrying one or two R alleles. After
Benjamini–Hochberg correction for testing for six mutation
classes, statistically significant (Po0.05) differences in expected
SNV counts were observed in four of the six mutation classes in
the TCGA data set (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2), and in five
out of six in the Yale data set (Table 1, Supplementary Table 3).
Statistically significant differences in expected SNV count were
observed for all six mutation classes in the combined data set
(all adjusted Po0.01, Table 1, Supplementary Table 4), with
this analysis being performed adjusting for the clinical variables
common to both collections. For fixed values of the other

 predictors and for the C4T mutation class, carrying one or more
R alleles was associated with a 24% (95% confidence interval (CI):
� 5 to 63%) increase in the expected somatic SNV count in the
TCGA data set, a 58% (95% CI: 11–124%) increase in the Yale
data set, and a 42% (95% CI: 15–76%) increase in the combined
data set (Table 1, Supplementary Table 4). Aside from MC1R
genotype, for the C4T mutation class in the combined data set,
the other significant predictors of mutation burden were age
(each extra year was associated with a 1.7% (95% CI: 0.9–2.4%)
increase in the expected somatic SNV count) and tissue collection
centre (Supplementary Table 4). Compared with the ‘baseline’
collection centre at the University of Sydney, melanomas from
several other centres had significantly lower C4T mutational
burdens, namely MD Anderson Medical Center, Greater Poland
Cancer
Centre,
the
University
of
Pittsburgh,
Essen
and
Yale, whereas melanomas from The International Genomics
Consortium had significantly higher numbers of this class of
mutation (Supplementary Table 4). For the TCGA data set, a
location on the head and neck rather than the extremities and
tissue collection centre were additional significant predictors of
C4T somatic mutation burden (Supplementary Table 2). Results
were similar for other mutation classes.
Alternative models for R allele presence and SNV count. We
also considered alternative frameworks to model the relationship
between R allele presence and somatic SNV count. Further
analyses did not reveal any consistent patterns in expected
mutation counts between individuals with one as compared with
two R alleles (Methods section, Supplementary Fig. 4). A
regression analysis in the combined data set considering the total
number of SNV mutations instead of SNV mutation classes also
found MC1R genotype to be a significant predictor of mutation
count, along with age of diagnosis and tissue collection centre
(Methods section, Supplementary Fig. 5), a result consistent with
our other analyses.

 Comparison of mutational signature differences. To further
investigate the mutational differences between R allele carriers
and non-carriers, we examined somatic mutational signatures
in a trinucleotide context24 (Methods section). Eight mutational
signatures explained 97.5% of mutations in the combined TCGA
and Yale melanoma data set (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7). The
sample group with one or two MC1R R alleles had a significantly
lower prevalence of the signature linked to age-associated
5-methylcytosine deamination, a result presumably explained in
part by their younger age at diagnosis (57.6 versus 62.2 years on
average; Supplementary Table 5). No other significant differences
in the mutational signatures were identified24,25.
Investigation of the role of MC1R in melanocyte biology. We
next considered whether the increased number of mutations
observed in tumours from MC1R variant carriers could be due to
differential DNA repair ability in primary human melanocytes
(HPMs). Therefore, we elected to explore the role of MC1R in
HPM cultures in response to UV light (Methods section, Fig. 2).
MC1R wild-type melanocytes were transfected with short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) constructs resulting in the suppression of MC1R
expression, or with a scrambled control shRNA, thus creating an
isogenic pair of cell lines for functional studies. Importantly,
knockdown of MC1R reduced but did not abolish MC1R
expression,
analogous
to
MC1R
expression
in
R
allele
heterozygotes26,27 (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 8). Irradiation
of cell lines with escalating doses of UV light (302 nm) resulted in
significantly
reduced
survival
of
MC1R
knockdown
cells
compared with cells transfected with a scrambled shRNA
control (Fig. 2b), and reduced activity of the transcription-
coupled/nucleotide excision repair pathway, as evidenced by
reduced luciferase activity in the host cell reactivation assay28
(Fig. 2c). Reduced MC1R expression was also associated with
increased
levels
of
CPDs
(Fig.
2d)
and
6–4
pyrimidine
photoproducts (6–4PP, Fig. 2e), a result in keeping with genetic
models using melanocytes from R allele carriers8,10.
Discussion
Most mutations found in melanoma genomes are likely to be
passengers, and are thus reflective of the UV exposure and other
mutagenic processes operative over a patient’s lifetime. Our
regression analyses suggest that the estimated increase in
expected SNV count associated with the presence of an MC1R
R allele for the C4T mutation class is comparable to the
estimated increase associated with an additional 21 years of age in
the combined data set, with similar estimates across the other
mutation classes (range 18–29 years; Table 1). R allele presence is
also a significant predictor of total SNV count (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Interestingly, our analysis did not reveal any consistent
patterns in mutation counts between individuals with one as
compared with two R alleles (Methods section, Supplementary
Fig. 4). This suggests that the majority of persons with one
R allele, who do not have a red hair/sun sensitivity phenotype,
may still be highly susceptible to the mutagenic effects of
UV light. Of note, it has been suggested that red haired,
sun-sensitive
individuals
are
more
likely
to
practice
sun
avoidance29,30, a factor that confounds ready interpretation of
the association between mutation count and number of R alleles.
Our study finds that melanomas from individuals carrying
MC1R R variants associated with red hair and freckling have a
significantly higher somatic mutational burden than melanomas
from individuals with no MC1R R variants. Intriguingly,
while C4T mutations were the most common mutational
class observed across all MC1R genotypes, all mutation classes
were significantly and similarly increased. This might reflect a
form of ‘collateral damage’ resulting from a decreased ability of
cells in patients with R alleles to protect themselves from UV
damage, or indicate that other mutational processes are operative
in melanocytes from these patients. When we compared the
mutational signatures present in MC1R R allele carriers to those
present in non-carriers (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7), we
observed no significant differences between the two groups apart
from the age-associated 5-methylcytosine deamination, a result
explained in part by the marginally younger average age of MC1R
R allele carriers. This suggests that the same mutational processes
are operative in R allele carriers as in non-carriers, but that the
relative frequency of mutational events may be what differs
between these groups. However, studies with larger sample sizes
should be performed to further investigate this relationship.
Notably, studies in mice have proposed a non-UV path to skin
tumourigenesis via pheomelanin, which has been shown to
induce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation15. Previous studies
have also investigated the role of MC1R in the DNA damage
response in melanoma cell lines, or in primary mouse cells in
culture31–33. Since DNA repair may be different in these systems
when compared to non-transformed human melanocytes, we
elected to explore the role of MC1R in HPM cultures in response
to UV light. These experiments show that, in this system, MC1R
knockdown significantly impairs survival and DNA repair
(Fig. 2a–c), and was also associated with increased levels of
CPDs (Fig. 2d) and 6–4PPs (Fig. 2e). While CPDs and 6–4PP are
primarily associated with C4T and CC4TT mutations, they
have also been associated with non-C4T mutations19, and thus

Adjusted incident rate ratios for R allele carriers compared to non-carriers together with 95% confidence intervals obtained via negative binomial regression. P values assess the null hypothesis that the
incident rate ratio equals one, separately for the TCGA data set (adjusted for all available clinical data), the Yale data set (adjusted for all available clinical data) and the combined data set (adjusted for
the clinical variables common to both datasets) with a Benjamini–Hochberg P value correcting for multiple testing of the six hypotheses (mutation classes) in the combined data set. The extra years of
age with an effect size comparable to carrying an R allele is the ratio of the regression coefficient for R carrier status divided by the per year regression coefficient for age. Further details can be found in

 may contribute to the elevated levels of these mutations observed
in R allele carriers. Importantly, a recent study has shown that
sequence context markedly affects the mutagenic effects of 6–4PP,
and the resulting nucleotide change34. Notably, N4T mutations
have been observed19, and this may provide a mechanistic
explanation for the enrichment of these mutations observed in
our study. Thus, the enrichment of the non-C4T signatures we
observe are likely to be the result of multiple mutagenic processes
such as lipid peroxidation and ROS activity15, together with the
effects of ultraviolet photoproducts such as 6–4PP.
In summary, we find a role for germline MC1R variants in
influencing the somatic mutational landscape of melanoma. Since
red heads comprise around 1–2% of the world’s population, yet
16% of melanoma patients35, and 26–40% of melanoma patients
are R allele carriers36, this work has significant implications for
understanding the genesis of melanoma in these high-risk groups.
Methods
Clinical variables in TCGA cohort. For the TCGA melanoma cohort21, the
available clinical variables included age at diagnosis, gender, tissue collection
centre, body area, tissue type, Breslow depth, Clark level and ulceration status
(Supplementary Data 2). The median age was 57 years (interquartile range 46–70,
missing information for one sample), and the cohort included 99 females and 174
males. 112 samples were from the extremities, 106 from the trunk, 21 from the
head and neck, 4 recorded as ‘other’ and 30 were unknown. 154 samples were from
a regional lymph node, 45 from regional tissue, 43 from a primary tumour and 31
from a distant metastasis. 35 samples had Clark level V, 92 level IV, 51 level III, 13
level II, five level I and 77 with unknown Clark level. 85 samples were ulcerated, 98
had no ulceration and 90 were unknown. The median Breslow depth was 2.5 mm
(interquartile range 1.2–5.0, unknown for 66 samples). Tissue collection centres
were: The University of Sydney (EE) which contributed 86 samples, MD Anderson
(D3) 55, Essen (FS) 36, the University of Pittsburgh (ER) 30, Asterand (EB) 27, the
Greater Poland Cancer Center (D9) 11, Roswell (GN) 11, the University of North
Carolina (FR) 6, The International Genomics Consortium (FW) 5, ABS - IUPUI
(GF) 3, Cureline (BF) 2 and The University of Miami (IH) 1.
Germline MC1R variant identification. Common MC1R variants have previously
established classifications26,37,38. To identify the precise variants carried by each
individual, for each normal/germline BAM, we called variants in the MC1R
region with samtools mpileup –Dsu -C50 -m2 -F0.0005 -d1000 and bcftools
view -p 0.99 -vcgN, applying the standard set of vcf-annotate filters, and applying
the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor39 to the canonical MC1R transcript
(ENST00000555147) including SIFT40 and PolyPhen41 scores. For each normal
BAM, we extracted MC1R polymorphisms that passed all filters, including the
nine canonical MC1R missense polymorphisms, nonsense or frameshift mutations
and variants predicted to be deleterious or damaging by SIFT or PolyPhen
(details below).
To classify rare alleles of MC1R as R or r, we used the SIFT 4.0.5 and PolyPhen
2.2.2 algorithms as indicated in Supplementary Fig. 1. R genotypes for each sample
are provided in Supplementary Data 2 (TCGA) and Supplementary Data 3 (Yale).
Of note, a recent report42 quantified membrane expression levels and cAMP
induction by the rare MC1R alleles p.Gly89Arg, p.Thr95Met, p.Asp121Glu and
p.Arg213Trp, found in patients from the TCGA cohort, as well as p.Ser83Leu, in
the same position as a variant found in a patient from the Yale cohort (p.Ser83Pro).
This study suggested that, whereas variants p.Gly89Arg, p.Asp121Glu and
p.Ser83Leu were classified correctly by SIFT and PolyPhen 2 (all as R alleles),
p.T95M might be more accurately classified as r and p.Arg213Trp as R. We have
replicated the analysis described in this paper (using the methods described below)
classifying p.Thr95Met as r and p.Arg213Trp as R. The results revealed that R allele
count was still a significant predictor of the overall SNV mutation count.
Coefficient estimates, 95% CIs, and P values for the R allele count predictor for
each mutation class for this analysis are provided in Supplementary Table 6.
Identification of somatic variants calls. We downloaded VCF files containing
somatic variant calls from CGHub43. These calls were produced by the three TCGA
analysis centres: the Broad Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, and UCSC.
Variants marked as ‘PASS’ and called by at least two centres were included in
subsequent analyses. We compared this set of calls with those released by the main
analysis of the TCGA SKCM Working Group21 (Supplementary Fig. 3) revealing

Figure 2 | MC1R expression regulates the formation of mutagenic photoproducts. (a) Shown are HPMs stably expressing control shRNA (shScr) or
multiple independent shMC1Rs targeting MC1R (#1, #2, #3). Cells were pre-incubated with 1 mM a-MSH for 30 min, then exposed to 100 J m � 2 UVB light,
and harvested 3 h later for Western blot analysis. (b) HPM cells stably expressing shMC1R#1 were irradiated with different doses of UVB light as indicated.
Cells were collected at 24 h after UVB light irradiation and viability assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. (c) HPMs stably expressing an shRNA against MC1R (shMC1R#1) or a scrambled control (ShScr) were transfected with 2 mg of UV damaged
pGL3 luciferase expression vector and 0.5 mg pRL Renilla Luciferase control reporter vector before the host cell reactivation assay28,32 (Methods section;
d,e). HPMs stably expressing an shRNA against MC1R (shMC1R#1) or a scrambled control (ShScr) were irradiated with 100 J m � 2 UVB light and then
collected at the different time points indicated. Genomic DNA was extracted and photoproducts were detected by ELISA. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer
(CPD) (d) or 6–4 pyrimidine photoproduct (6–4PP) (e) antibodies were used (Methods section). These data were compiled from three separate
experiments performed in triplicate. Significance (*Po0.05) was calculated by using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test comparing the means
(shScr vs shMC1R#1) of the three experiments. Error bars represent s.d.

 high concordance. TCGA SKCM somatic calls were downloaded on August 2015
from http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/skcm_2015/.
Modelling the effect of R alleles on somatic mutation count. For each of the six
basic SNV classes (C4A, C4G, C4T, T4A, T4C and T4G), we modelled the
relationship between expected somatic SNV burden and the presence of MC1R R
alleles using negative binomial regression with a log link (that is, modelling
log(expected SNV count)). We controlled for all available clinical variables. Missing
clinical variable values in the TCGA data set were imputed 10 times using the
MICE package in R44,45, with the variables age, Breslow thickness, gender, Clark
level, ulceration, tissue source, tissue type, body area, R allele presence and the
counts for each of the six basic mutational classes being included in the univariate
imputation models44. Values for any level of a categorical variable with o5
samples were also set to missing and imputed. For the Yale Melanoma data set,
there were fewer clinical variables available but there was no missing information.
For our primary analysis, the estimates of the effect of carrying at least one
R allele were compared with persons carrying zero R alleles.
Alternative models for R allele presence and SNV count. As described above,
we compared the somatic mutation burden of melanomas from individuals with
one or two R alleles to individuals with zero R alleles. We also considered an
alternative model in which the somatic mutation count in the combined data set
is regressed on R allele count (three levels) instead of presence/absence of an R
allele (two levels; Supplementary Fig. 4). In this framework, the average increase in
the expected C4T somatic SNV count associated with the presence of each R allele
is comparable to the increased mutational burden associated with an additional
16.15 years of age. However, the numbers of R/R individuals in these cohorts is not
sufficient to assess the contribution of R alleles individually.
We also considered a model in which total somatic SNV count in the combined
data set is regressed on the presence or the absence of R alleles, instead of
considering each mutation class separately (Supplementary Figure 5). This analysis
is dominated by C4T mutations as they are much more abundant than the other
mutational classes. The significant predictors of total somatic SNV count in this
analysis were age at diagnosis, R allele presence and tissue collection centre.
Extraction of mutational signatures. We extracted mutational signatures in the
trinucleotide context24 de novo on the combined TCGA and Yale data sets using a
Hierarchical Dirichlet Process46 (HDP) with one child-DP node per sample, one
parent-DP node per R allele group (zero or at least one R allele), and one
grandparent-DP node with a uniform Dirichlet prior distribution. We initialized
the HDP with four clusters, then ran four independent Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) chains with 10,000 burn-in iterations and 500 posterior samples collected
off each chain with 50 iterations between each (2,000 posterior samples in total).
We performed all analyses with the ‘hdp’ R package version 0.1.0, available at
github.com/nicolaroberts/hdp.
Melanocyte cultures and ultraviolet exposure. HPMs were isolated from
foreskins as described previously47 and cultured in Medium 254 from Life
Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed with PBS twice and exposed to UVB light in
a Stratalinker ultraviolet chamber (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) fitted with
ultraviolet B bulbs (UVP Inc. CA). Ultraviolet emittance was measured using an
ultraviolet photometer (UV Products, Upland, CA, USA). An ultraviolet B dose of
100 J m � 2 is equivalent to one standard erythema dose of UVB light.
Plasmids and shRNA constructs. shRNA constructs targeting human MC1R
(Cat. No. RHS4533-EG4157) were purchased from Open Biosystems (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The target sequence for shMC1R#1 is 50-AAATGTCTCTTTA
GGAGCCTG-30.
Antibodies and western blot. Anti-MC1R (N-19; at a dilution of 1:500) antibody
and Peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (at dilution 1:2,000)
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX). Peroxidase-
conjugated b-actin (ACTB, at dilution 1:10,000) antibody was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously47.
DNA damage repair assays. CPD and 6–4PP ELISA were performed by using
anti-CPD and anti-6–4PP antibodies, the purified anti-mouse IgG mAb was diluted
to 2 mg ml � 1 in PBS and added into an enhanced protein-binding ELISA plate
(for example, Falcon Labware plate). Antibodies specific for CPD (MC-062) and
6–4PP (KTM-50) were diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer and added to each well.
Optical density at 405 nm was measured. For the host cell reactivation assay28,
pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) was irradiated at a dose of 700 J m � 2 of UVC light
to induce DNA damage in the form of CPD and 6–4PP, which block transcription
until repaired. Damaged pGL3 was transfected into cells using lipofectamine 2000
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). A Renilla vector was used as a transfection control.
