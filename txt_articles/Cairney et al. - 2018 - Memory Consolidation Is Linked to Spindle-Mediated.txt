SUMMARY
How are brief encounters transformed into lasting
memories? Previous research has established the
role of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, along
with its electrophysiological signatures of slow oscil-
lations (SOs) and spindles, for memory consolidation
[1–4]. In related work, experimental manipulations
have demonstrated that NREM sleep provides a win-
dow of opportunity to selectively strengthen partic-
ular memory traces via the delivery of auditory cues
[5–10], a procedure known as targeted memory
reactivation (TMR). It has remained unclear, how-
ever, whether TMR triggers the brain’s endogenous
consolidation mechanisms (linked to SOs and/or
spindles) and whether those mechanisms in turn
mediate effective processing of mnemonic informa-
tion. We devised a novel paradigm in which associa-
tive memories (adjective-object and adjective-scene
pairs) were selectively cued during a post-learning
nap,
successfully
stabilizing
next-day
retention
relative to non-cued memories. First, we found that,
compared to novel control adjectives, memory
cues evoked an increase in fast spindles. Critically,
during the time window of cue-induced spindle
activity, the memory category linked to the verbal
cue (object or scene) could be reliably decoded,
with the fidelity of this decoding predicting the
behavioral consolidation benefits of TMR. These re-
sults provide correlative evidence for an information
processing role of sleep spindles in service of mem-
ory consolidation.
RESULTS
We tested the prediction that TMR delivered in non-rapid eye
movement (NREM) sleep bolsters memory retention by exploit-
ing the brain’s endogenous consolidation mechanisms. Of the
neural oscillations unique to NREM sleep, spindles have been
recently implicated in memory reactivation and spontaneous
information processing [11, 12] and thus appear to be the prime
candidate to mediate consolidation in a targeted manner.
As shown in Figure 1, participants (n = 46) encoded pairwise
associations (adjective-object and adjective-scene pairs) before
an initial test phase (T1), in which adjective-recognition judge-
ments (old or new) were made (see Table S1). Critically, for
recognized adjectives, recall of the associated image (object or
scene) was assessed. Half of the correctly recalled adjective-ob-
ject and adjective-scene pairs were randomly assigned to a cued
condition, such that the adjectives would be replayed during the
offline period (targeted memory reactiviation [TMR]). The other
half of the correctly recalled pairs were assigned to a non-cued
condition. The to-be-cued adjectives were intermixed with a
number of non-encoded control adjectives. Immediately after
T1, participants either took a 90 min nap (nap group; n = 27,
19 females) or remained awake for the same period of time
(wake group; n = 19 females). In the nap group, TMR took place
during NREM stages N2 and N3. In the wake group, TMR coin-
cided with a working memory task to prevent participants from
directly attending to the cues [7, 9]. After the offline period, par-
ticipants completed a second test (T2) before returning after an
additional night of sleep to complete a final test phase (T3).
Behavior
Category recall at T1 did not differ between the nap and wake
groups (t(44) = 0.77, p = 0.45; see Table S2, Figure 2A). Category
retention at T2 (i.e., the proportion of T1-recalled categories that
were also recalled at T2) was significantly better after sleep than
wakefulness (Group main effect: F(1,44) = 17.10; p < .0001)
but unaffected by cueing (TMR main effect: F(1,44) = 0.19,
p = 0.66; TMR*Group interaction: F(1,44) = 0.02, p = 0.89) (Fig-
ure 2C). However, category retention at T3 (i.e., the proportion
of T2-recalled categories that were also recalled at T3) revealed
both a memory benefit of sleep (Group main effect: F(1,44) =
9.34; p = 0.004) and a recall advantage from cueing (TMR
main effect: F(1,44) = 4.65, p = 0.04; TMR*Group interaction:
F(1,44) = 3.94, p = 0.05). The memory-enhancing effects of
TMR were driven by the nap group, who exhibited superior
retention of cued relative to non-cued categories (t(26) = 3.83,
p = 0.001), whereas no such difference was observed in the
wake group (t(18) = 0.09, p = 0.93). Taken together, these results
suggest that TMR in post-learning sleep augmented overnight
consolidation processes, improving retention the following day.

 In the nap group, the behavioral benefit of TMR on T3 retention,
quantified as: [proportion of cued T2-recalled categories also
recalled at T3 minus proportion of non-cued T2-recalled cate-
gories also recalled at T3] was not correlated with the total
number of memory cues presented (objects + scenes) in sleep
(Spearman’s rho = 0.02, p = 0.93; see STAR Methods). Exemplar
recall data is available in Table S3.
At the end of the experiment, participants were re-presented
with all of the adjectives from the encoding phase and, for
each, asked to indicate whether or not it was replayed in the off-
line period. The discrimination task analysis was restricted to
items that were correctly recalled at T1 (and thus assigned to
the cued and non-cued conditions). Cued stimuli that were and
were not correctly identified as such were marked as hits and
misses, respectively. Non-cued stimuli that were and were not
correctly identified as such were marked as correct rejections
or false alarms, respectively. A discrimination index was then
calculated for each participant by subtracting the proportion of
non-cued trials marked as false alarms from the proportion of
cued trials marked as hits. The discrimination index was not
significantly different from zero in either the nap group (t(26) =
0.07, p = 0.95) or the wake group (t(18) = 1.67, p = 0.11), implying
that participants could not reliably identify the cue stimuli. It
should be noted that none of the nap group participants pro-
fessed any knowledge of adjective replay.
EEG
As a first step, we explored the event-related potentials (ERPs)
evoked by auditory cues for previously presented (old) adjectives
in the nap group (see Table S4 for descriptive sleep electroen-
cephalogram [EEG] data). As shown in Figure 2B, auditory
cues were followed by a pronounced ERP response resembling
a slow oscillation (SO)/k-complex, with comparable patterns for
old object cues, old scene cues, and new control stimuli (Fig-
ure S1). Note also that the relatively small ERP amplitude results
from the temporal jitter of evoked responses relative to the cue
onset and that these responses surpass standard amplitude
criteria for SOs/k-complexes when aligned to their respective
event centers (Figure S2). Consistent with previous findings
[13], time-frequency representation (TFR) results showed that
these cue-induced SOs harbored a theta/slow spindle burst in
the SO trough (henceforth referred to as SO down-state), which
was followed by a fast spindle burst in the ensuing SO peak
(henceforth referred to as SO up-state).

Figure 1. Experimental Paradigm
(A) During encoding, participants were presented
with 50 adjective-object and 50 adjective-scene
combinations (randomly intermixed) and indicated
whether the combinations elicited a realistic or
bizarre mental image. Prior to encoding, partici-
pants performed a familiarization phase for both
the
adjectives
and
the
images
(see
STAR
Methods). Approximately 5 min after encoding,
participants performed the first retrieval session
(T1), in which all previously seen (old) adjectives
were intermixed with 50 previously unseen (new)
adjectives and participants indicated whether they
thought the adjective was old or new. In the case of
an
‘‘old’’
response,
participants
were
asked
whether they also remembered the associated
image category (object or scene) or whether
they did not remember the associated category
(‘‘?’’ response option). If they indicated ‘‘object’’ or
‘‘scene,’’ another screen appeared (not shown) in
which participants could type in a description of
the image if they remembered it or simply type in
a ‘‘?’’ if they did not. Adjectives were presented
visually and acoustically throughout.
(B) In the nap group, participants were given the
opportunity to sleep for 90 min (monitored with
polysomnography). Once they entered late NREM
sleep (stages N2 and N3), (1) half of the adjectives
for which the object category was remembered at
T1, (2) half of the adjectives for which the scene
category was remembered at T1, and (3) a
matched number of novel adjectives (controls)
were continuously played via external speakers
(targeted memory reactivation [TMR]). In the wake
group, participants started with 30 min of playing
the online game Bubble Shooter, followed by
30 min of performing a 1-back working memory
task during which TMR was applied, followed
again by 30 min of playing Bubble Shooter.
(C) After the offline period (T2), participants performed the same test as in T1 but with a new set of 50 lure adjectives. Finally, after a night of sleep, participants
returned the next morning (T3) for another retrieval session, again with 50 new lure adjectives. For detailed description of behavioral results, see Tables S1–S3.

 To more directly isolate the mechanisms engaged in the pro-
cessing of mnemonic cues, we next asked whether evoked
oscillatory responses might be able to distinguish between old
cues and novel control adjectives. As shown in Figures 3A and
3B, the direct contrast revealed that old cues elicited a signifi-
cant increase in oscillatory power in the fast spindle band
(13–16 Hz) from �1.7 to 2.3 s after cue onset (p < 0.05, corrected
for multiple comparisons across channels, time, and frequency).
Topographical representation of the significant spindle band in-
crease revealed that the effect stemmed from left-hemisphere
electrodes, with a maximum at centroparietal sites C3/P3 (Fig-
ure 3C). The increase in fast spindle power for old cues versus
control stimuli (1.7–2.3 s; Figure 3B) was even more pronounced
when restricting old cues to those that yielded successful mem-
ory during both T2 and T3 testing (t(26) = 2.10, p = 0.007 as
opposed to t(26) = 2.09, p = 0.014 when including all trials).
To fully characterize the observed spindle power increase for
old (versus new) cues, we algorithmically detected discrete spin-
dle events (see STAR Methods) from 1.5 to 2.5 s post-cue onset
(set to encapsulate the window of increased spindle power in our
TFR analysis). Indeed, old relative to new cues elicited more
fast spindles across left-hemisphere electrodes (t(26) = 3.33,
p = 0.003, Figure S3A), corroborating that the spindle band
power increase (Figure 3A) is due to a relative surge in discrete
spindle events. Figure 3D displays the resulting grand average

increase of theta/slow spindle power in the evoked

are shown in Figure S1.

spindle across participants, aligned to
the maximum of the detected spindle
events. As can be appreciated by the
above-zero spindle center, these spin-
dles appeared to be modulated by the
up-states of concomitant SOs. To statis-
tically
quantify
this
observation,
we
derived the preferred phase of spindle-
SO coupling for the detected events (see STAR Methods).
Indeed, as shown in Figure 3D, the preferred phase of SO-spin-
dle modulation clustered significantly around the SO up-state
(0�) across participants (Rayleigh test: z = 8.7, p < .001; V test
versus 0: v = 13.9, p < .001). In sum, these results show that
old memory cues relative to new control adjectives elicit an in-
crease in fast spindle events, which are localized to left-hemi-
sphere sites. Spindles were further found to be modulated by
the SO up-state, but note that direct comparison of SO-spindle
coupling for old cues versus control adjectives was impeded
by the low numbers of spindles elicited by control adjectives.
If the surge in fast spindles for old cues was indeed indicative
of cue-induced information processing, we reasoned that we
should be able to decode from evoked EEG responses the cat-
egorical features of the images paired with the adjectives during
learning (object versus scene; Figure 1). We used a representa-
tional similarity analysis (RSA) approach to tackle this question
[14]. First, we derived a feature vector of 8 channels 3 41 time
points (spanning 200 ms at our sampling rate of 200 Hz) centered
at each sample from �0.2 to 2.5 s relative to cue onset. Next,
using Spearman correlations, we quantified both the within-
category similarity (how similar is the EEG pattern of a given
object-related adjective to the EEG pattern of all other object-
related adjectives, and how similar is the pattern of a given
scene-related adjective to the pattern of all other scene-related
950
Current Biology 28, 948–954, March 19, 2018
 adjectives) and the between-category similarity (how similar is
the pattern of a given object-related adjective to the pattern of
all scene-related adjectives and vice versa) at each time point.
Converging evidence was sought via a standard decoding
approach (linear discriminant analysis [LDA]; see Figure S4).
However, the advantage of our RSA approach is that it provides,
via the between-category similarity, a single measure that cap-
tures the level of pattern distinctiveness of objects versus scenes
(i.e., the smaller the between-category similarity, the greater the
category distinctiveness of object versus scene information).
Category-specific
information
processing
would
be
ex-
pressed as an increase in within-category similarity (collapsed
across object- and scene-related adjectives) compared to be-
tween-category similarity. As shown in Figure 4A, within-cate-
gory similarity tended to exceed between-category similarity
throughout the post-cue period. Importantly, however, the stron-
gest effect that also reached statistical significance (p < .05, cor-
rected for multiple comparisons across time) was observed from
1.76 to 2.06 s after cue onset, which is closely overlapped with
the observed window of increased fast spindle power for old
relative to new cues (1.7–2.3 s; Figure 3B). It deserves explicit
mention that the EEG features used for this analysis was not
spindle power per se but the raw EEG trace across electrodes
(see STAR Methods). In fact, the diagnostic information was
largely carried by lower-frequency topographies; i.e., the result
pattern in Figure 4A held when low pass filtering the EEG below
4 Hz but diminished when high pass filtering the EEG above 4 Hz.
This could be due to spindles effectively inducing event-related
(lower frequency) EEG responses at target sites and/or to the
fact that higher-frequency EEG components are too irregular
to allow reliable time-by-time decoding across trials. In any
case, to investigate the relationship between fast spindles and
category-specific information processing beyond temporal co-
occurrence, we next assessed the correlation between (1) rela-
tive spindle counts for old cues versus control stimuli from 1.5
to 2.5 s post-cue and (2) the level of category distinctiveness

 for objects versus scenes (1 minus between-category similarity)
in the same time window. Intriguingly, we observed a significant
positive correlation between the two variables (Spearman’s
rho = 0.47, p = 0.014; Figure S3B), supporting the notion that
spindles are linked to processing of the informational content
of reactivated memory traces.
Lastly, we asked whether spindle-mediated information pro-
cessing bears any relevance for behavioral manifestations of
consolidation. To this end, we assessed the correlation between
(1) the behavioral benefit of cueing on T3 retention (proportion of
cued T2-recalled categories also recalled at T3 minus proportion
of non-cued T2-recalled categories also recalled at T3) and (2)
category distinctiveness of object versus scene information
(1 minus between-category similarity, averaged across the
1.76–2.06 s effect window). As shown in Figure 4B, the results
revealed a significant positive relationship between the two vari-
ables (Spearman’s rho = 0.41, p = 0.03).
DISCUSSION
Our study reveals that spindle-mediated information processing
is a central mechanism for offline consolidation and that TMR
may exploit this mechanism to selectively strengthen particular
memory traces. Specifically, we found that memory cues deliv-
ered in NREM sleep prompted a transient increase in fast spin-
dles that was coupled to depolarising SO up-states (Figure 3).
During this surge in spindle activity, the categorical features of
cued representations could be reliably decoded, with the level
of category distinctiveness predicting the behavioral impact of
TMR on consolidation (Figure 4).
What is the functional significance of fast spindles for memory
consolidation? Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings have shown
that reactivation of learning networks is linked to spindle param-
eters during subsequent NREM sleep [11]. Moreover, olfactory
memory cueing has been shown to evoke sleep spindles in
task-relevant brain regions [15]. Although ceiling memory perfor-
mance in these two studies precluded a direct link to consolida-
tion, their findings suggest that a TMR-induced increase in fast
spindle activity may reflect mnemonic processing in relevant
hippocampal-neocortical networks. This view is substantiated
by the left-hemispheric specificity of the cue-evoked spindle in-
crease observed in our study (Figure 3C), which may reflect the
verbal properties of the auditory cues.
More critically, during this transient, cue-induced fast spindle
increase, we were able to reliably decode the categorical fea-
tures (i.e., object versus scene) of the mnemonic association
linked to the verbal cue (Figures 4A and S4), with the fidelity of
category distinctiveness predicting the cueing benefit on next-
day memory retention across participants (Figure 4B). One
intriguing possibility is that spindles effectively gate activation
toward category-specific cortical modules, leading to discrimi-
nable distributions of the spatiotemporal EEG patterns. Consis-
tent with this notion, recent work applying EEG classifiers to
continuous overnight sleep recordings has shown that spectral
power in the spindle range contributes to the ability to decode
previously learned materials [12]. It would thus be interesting
for future studies to directly compare the neural correlates of
cue-evoked versus spontaneous memory reactivation. Also,
both studies provide correlational rather than causal evidence
for spindle-mediated information processing, and electrophysio-
logical control over various spindle parameters would strongly
corroborate the relationship between spindles and memory
consolidation.
Mechanistically, modeling and empirical data suggest that
spindle oscillations induce a massive Ca2+ influx into dendrites
of pyramidal neurons, opening a molecular ‘‘gate’’ for synaptic
plasticity and, consequently, permanent network changes
[16–18]. Finely tuned windows of spindle activity, triggered by

 TMR, may therefore prime or ‘‘tag’’ relevant synapses for plastic
changes during subsequent periods of sleep. Owing to the highly
robust effects of sleep (versus wake) on retention in the current
paradigm (Figure 2C), however, the comparatively subtle mne-
monic influences of TMR may have failed to emerge immediately
after sleep. This may explain why the behavioral benefits of TMR
observed in this study did not emerge until the following day,
once the cued (tagged) representations had undergone addi-
tional overnight processing. It is important to note that the time
between TMR and the overnight sleep interval included an inter-
vening test phase (T2; Figure 1C). Given recent views on the
potential mechanistic overlap between online reactivation and
offline consolidation [19], it is also possible that T2-retrieval
modulated interactions between TMR and subsequent overnight
memory processing. In other words, the reactivation of mem-
ories at T2 might have contributed to the observable benefit of
cueing at T3. How the memory effects of TMR are influenced
by memory reprocessing during online and offline periods will
be a fruitful avenue for future research.
Owing to the limited spatial resolution of scalp EEG moni-
toring, the putative role of hippocampally generated ripples
(>80 Hz oscillations) in our paradigm remains open. This is an
important consideration as neuronal reactivations are mostly
observed in conjunction with ripple events [20–22], which are
temporally nested within the oscillatory troughs of spindles
[23–25]. The Active Systems framework postulates that these
synchronized spindle-ripple interactions enable spindle oscilla-
tions to shuttle reactivated hippocampal representations to
distributed neocortical sites during excitable SO up-states
[26–29]. Unifying our experimental paradigm with methods for
detecting hippocampal ripples in humans (e.g., intracranial
EEG) would thus provide exceptional insights into mnemonic
processing in the sleeping brain. Notably, spindle-ripple inter-
actions may reveal even greater detail on the informational
content of decoded associations than spindle oscillations
alone.
In sum, our findings suggest that experimental memory cueing
generates finely tuned windows of spindle-mediated information
processing, which underpins the selective strengthening of cued
representations. These findings not only offer mechanistic in-
sights into the mnemonic impacts of TMR but also provide
unique and highly controlled experimental evidence for the crit-
ical role of spindles in offline memory consolidation.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
A total of 83 participants took part in this study. However, 15 participants were excluded because they did not meet the performance
criterion in the pre-sleep test (T1). One further participant withdrew having not understood the necessary time commitments of the
study. Of those participants remaining who took part in the nap version of the experiment, a further 21 were excluded for the following
reasons: insufficient sleep such that at least one full round of targeted memory reactivation (TMR) could not be attained (9), exhibiting
an arousal or awakening during TMR and not returning to non-rapid eye movement sleep stage N2/N3 (10) and computer malfunction
(2). The analyses reported in this paper were thus carried out on 46 participants, who were assigned to a nap group (n = 27, 19 female,
mean ± SD age, 19.70 ± 1.51 years) or a wake group (n = 19 females, mean ± SD age, 19.26 ± 1.15 years). Note that all results reported
in the main text were reliable when restricting the nap group to female participants only (n = 19). Pre-study screening questionnaires
indicated that participants had no history of sleep, psychiatric or neurological disorders and were not using any psychologically
active medications. Participants were informed that they were taking part in a memory study, but were unaware that targeted memory
reactivation (TMR) would take place. Also, no explicit mention of the T3 memory test was provided once the first session was
completed. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in line with the Research Ethics Committees of the Depart-
ment of Psychology, University of York and the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham.
METHOD DETAILS
Stimuli
Adjectives
250 adjectives were randomly selected from a longer list of 355 [33] for each participant. Mean (±SD) adjective length was 6.85 ± 1.84
characters and number of syllables ranged from 1-4. All adjectives were recorded in a female voice. Mean (±SD) duration of all
included adjectives was 704 ± 146 ms.
Objects and Scenes
100 images (50 objects and 50 scenes) were randomly selected from a set of 200 [34] for each participant. Objects were images of
everyday items, animals or food presented on a plain white background (e.g., an apple). Scenes were images of nameable land-
scapes or places (e.g., a bowling alley). Care was taken to ensure that scenes contained sufficient background detail to be easily
distinguishable from objects. The distinction between objects and scenes was clearly explained to participants.
Procedure
Participants completed a short practice version (10 trials) of each experimental task to ensure that they fully understood the instruc-
tions. All responses were made via keyboard press on a PC. Experimental stimuli were always presented in random order.
Familiarisation
A familiarisation phase at the beginning of the experiment was designed to facilitate learning of the adjective-image pairs in the main
encoding session. First, participants completed an adjective familiarisation task. On each trial, one of 100 adjectives (e.g., ‘‘exotic’’)
was presented acoustically and displayed for 2.5 s on the computer screen. Participants indicated whether they considered the
adjective to be emotionally positive or negative. Each trial was separated by an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) with a fixation cross for

 1.5 s (±100 ms random jitter). Next, participants completed an object/scene categorisation task. On each trial, one of 50 objects
(e.g., butterfly) or 50 scenes (e.g., golf course) was displayed for 2.5 s. Participants indicated whether they considered the image
to be an object or a scene (ISI = 1.5 s ± 100 ms).
Encoding
Participants learned randomized pairwise associations between the adjectives and images presented in the familiarisation phase
(100 adjective-image pairs). On each trial, a randomly selected adjective (e.g., ‘‘exotic’’) was presented acoustically and displayed
above an object or scene (e.g., object: butterfly) for 4.5 s. To facilitate learning, participants were instructed to form a vivid mental
image or story that closely linked the adjective and the object/scene, and then indicate whether the image they had formed was real-
istic or bizarre (ISI = 1.5 s ± 100 ms). For example, the mental image corresponding to the adjective ‘‘exotic’’ and the object butterfly
would presumably be realistic as butterflies can be exotic creatures. Participants were informed that their memory for adjective-
image pairs would be tested immediately afterward.
Immediate Test (T1)
T1 included the 100 adjectives from encoding intermixed with 50 new adjectives that participants had not seen before (foils). On each
trial, an adjective (e.g., ‘‘exotic’’) was presented acoustically and visually displayed for 2 s. Afterward, participants were asked to indi-
cate whether the adjective was ‘old’ (i.e., they recognized it from the encoding phase) or ‘new’ (i.e., it was not seen at encoding) within
10 s. When participants provided a ‘‘new’’ response, they immediately moved on to the next trial (ISI = 1.5 s ± 100 ms). When an ‘‘old’’
response was provided, participants were required to indicate whether the associated image was an object or a scene, or whether
they had forgotten the target image category. In order to ensure that object or scene responses were not mere guesses, participants
also provided a typed description of the image they had remembered. Across all T1 trials where the category was correctly recalled,
participants were able to correctly describe the image on the majority of occasions (mean ± SD: 80.95 ± 14.59%), demonstrating that
the category responses reflected veridical memory.
TMR Set Up
Of the adjective-image pairs that were correctly recalled at T1 (i.e., when the adjective was correctly recognized and the associated
image category correctly recalled), half were randomly allocated to the cued condition (i.e., for TMR), whereas the other half were
assigned to the non-cued condition (object and scene pairs were equally distributed between the two conditions). This ensured
that baseline category recall performance was balanced between the cued and non-cued memories. For example, if a participant
correctly recalled 40 pairs at T1, then 20 of these would be assigned to the cued condition and the other 20 assigned to the non-
cued condition. On occasions where there were an odd number of correctly recalled pairs, the spare item was randomly allocated
to the cued or non-cued condition. To ensure that a sufficient number of stimuli were available for TMR in sleep, participants were
required to correctly recall at least 14 objects and 14 scenes at T1. Participants that did not meet this criterion were excluded (n = 15).
The adjectives from pairs assigned to the cued condition were replayed during the TMR phase. Importantly, an additional set of con-
trol adjectives that participants had not encountered at either encoding or T1 were randomly intermixed with the TMR stimuli. The
number of control adjectives was equal to half the number of stimuli in the cued condition. For example, if there were 40 adjectives
associated with correctly recalled categories in the cued condition, then a further 20 control adjectives would be added to the TMR
set (total = 60). Inclusion of the control adjectives enabled a direct comparison of brain activity during cued memory reactivation and
non-specific, matched auditory stimulation.
The mean ± SEM number of cues assigned to each condition were as follows. Nap group: 12.59 ± 0.73 object cues, 13.37 ± 0.82
scene cues, 13.63 ± 0.80 control stimuli. Wake group: 11.74 ± 0.91 object cues, 12.84 ± 0.74 scene cues, 12.53 ± 0.78 control stimuli.
However, cues were presented continuously throughout the offline period (i.e., during late non-REM sleep in the nap group), so the
mean ± SEM absolute number of cue presentations were as follows. Nap group: 69.44 ± 10.13 object cues, 74.48 ± 11.91 scene
cues, 73.82 ± 11.16 control stimuli. Wake group: 97.26 ± 5.08 object cues, 108.63 ± 6.10 scene cues, 104.84 ± 4.62 control stimuli.
Numbers of absolute cue presentations were applied to a 3 (Cue Type: Object/Scene/Control) x 2 (Group: Nap/Wake) mixed ANOVA.
Because T1 category recall was numerically greater for scenes than objects, there were more scene than object cues assigned to the
TMR set (Cue Type main effect [Huynh-Feldt corrected]: F(1.07,46.94) = 6.94, p = 0.01). In general, there was more cueing time avail-
able in the wake delay than in the nap delay, meaning that the wake group received more cues than the nap group (Group main effect:
F(1,44) = 5.09, p = 0.03). Despite this difference, the wake group failed to exhibit any behavioral benefit of cueing, further demon-
strating that TMR is – in the current paradigm - only effective at bolstering memory retention when delivered in sleep. There was
no Cue Type*Group interaction ([Huynh-Feldt corrected]: F(1.07,46.94) = 0.97, p = 0.34). After EEG artifact rejection in the nap group,
the corresponding numbers were: 67.63 ± 9.82 object cues, 71.74 ± 11.35 scene cues, 71.30 ± 10.65 control stimuli. There was no
significant difference in the number of artifact-rejected cues in each condition ([Huynh-Feldt corrected] F(1.14, 29.59 = 2.31, p = 0.14).
Offline Period (Nap or Wakefulness)
The offline period began at �2pm and lasted 90 min. Participants in the nap group were left to sleep in a laboratory bedroom while
their brain activity was monitored with polysomnography (set up before the study began). TMR was initiated when participants were
in late NREM stage N2/early stage N3. The TMR set was presented in a randomized order (ISI = 4 s ± 200 ms) at a sound intensity
of �40dB (as measured with a sound-level meter placed at the same position where participants laid their head on the pillow). After
each full round of cueing, the adjectives were reshuffled and immediately presented again. Cueing continued for as long as partic-
ipants were in sleep stage N2/N3, but immediately paused if they showed signs of micro-arousal or awakening, or moved into sleep
stage N1 or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The cues were continued if participants re-entered sleep stage N2/N3 after an arousal.

 Participants in the wake group played an online game (Bubble Shooter) for the first 30 min of the offline period. For the next 30 min,
the TMR cues were presented continuously while participants completed a 1-back working memory task. This approach reduced the
probability that participants directly attended to the cues during TMR [7, 9]. During the 1-back task, a series of random numbers be-
tween 0 and 10 were presented one after another in the center of the screen. The task was to indicate whether the current number was
the same as or different to the number one digit prior. After completing the 1-back task, participants played Bubble Shooter again for
the remaining 30 min of the offline period.
Follow-Up Tests (T2 and T3)
Participants returned 6 hours later for a follow-up test (T2). This followed the same procedures as T1 with the single exception that
new foil adjectives were used. The next morning (after a night of sleep), participants completed another test (T3). Again, this followed
the same procedures as T1 and T2, but with a new set of foils.
Discrimination Task
After completing T3, participants were informed of the true purpose of the study and asked if they had been aware of the auditory
cues in the offline period. To assess their explicit knowledge of the cues, participants were asked to complete an adjective discrim-
ination task. On each trial, one of 100 adjectives from the encoding phase was presented acoustically and visually displayed for 10 s.
Participants were asked to indicate whether or not the adjective had been replayed during the offline period.
Equipment
Experimental Tasks and TMR
All experimental tasks and TMR algorithms were implemented on a PC with MATLAB 2015a and Psychtoolbox 3.0.13 [30]. In the
wake group, adjective cues were presented via speakers connected to the task PC. In the nap group, cues were presented via a
speaker mounted �1.5 m above the bed, which was connected to an amplifier in a separate control room.
Polysomnography
An Embla N7000 PSG system with RemLogic 3.4 software was used to monitor sleep. After the scalp was cleaned with NuPrep exfo-
liating agent (Weave and Company), gold plated electrodes were attached using EC2 electrode cream (Grass Technologies). EEG
scalp electrodes were attached according to the international 10-20 system at 8 locations: frontal (F3, F4), central (C3, C4), parietal
(P3, P4) and occipital (O1, O2), and each was referenced to an electrode on the contralateral mastoid (A1 or A2). Left and right elec-
trooculography electrodes were attached, as were electromyography electrodes at the mentalis and submentalis bilaterally, and a
ground electrode was attached to the forehead. Each electrode had a connection impedance of < 5 kU. All online signals were unfil-
tered and digitally sampled at 200 Hz. Sleep scoring was carried out in accordance with the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep
Medicine [35].
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data Analysis
Behavioral Data Analysis
Category recall was our primary measure of memory accuracy. We calculated for each participant: 1) the proportion of target cat-
egories recalled at T1 that were subsequently recalled at T2, and 2) the proportion of target categories recalled at T2 that were sub-
sequently recalled at T3 (i.e., following a night of sleep). To avoid any ambiguity related to category memory, we excluded from our
analyses any item that was incorrectly classified during the object/scene categorisation task. Across all participants, we excluded
162 items out of a possible 4600 (3.52%). Category recall scores at T1, T2 and T3 were normally distributed in both the nap and
wake groups (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p > .05), and thus met the assumptions of analysis of variance (ANOVA). As such, the
data were subjected to a 2 (TMR: Cued/Not-Cued) X 2 (Group: Nap/Wake) mixed ANOVA. The statistical significance threshold
was set at p < .05. Behavioral data were analyzed with SPSS statistics 24.
EEG Data Analysis
EEG data were analyzed with MATLAB, using the FieldTrip [31] (v.06/02/2017) and CircStat [32] (v.1) toolboxes. The continuous sleep
data were segmented into epochs from �1 s to 3 s around cue onset and subjected to a two-step artifact rejection procedure. In the
first step, artifacts were automatically detected and removed based on the median ± 3.5 inter-quartile ranges of both signal amplitude
and gradients (the difference between two adjacent samples) of all epochs. In the second step, the remaining epochs were manually
screened via FieldTrip’s visual summary functions and epochs containing amplitude, variance or kurtosis outliers were additionally
removed. For TMR-cue-locked analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs), data were high-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz and baseline-cor-
rected with respect to the �200 ms to 0 ms window before cue onset. For time-frequency representations (TFRs), data were
convolved with a 5-cycles hanning taper and spectral power was obtained from 4-30 Hz in 0.5 Hz frequency steps and 5 ms time
steps. For analyses, participant-specific TFRs were converted into percent power change relative to a �300 ms to �100 ms pre-cue
window. Because our TFR analysis relied on extended data windows to fit 5 cycles per frequency (e.g., 15 Hz x 5 cycles = 333 ms),
a �300 ms to �100 ms baseline window was chosen to mitigate baseline contamination by post-stimulus activity while preserving
proximity to cue onset. Note though that TFR comparison of old cues versus control stimuli (Figure 3) revealed the same significant
13-16 Hz power increase when the TFR baseline window matched that of the ERP analysis (�200 to 0 ms).
For representational similarity analysis (RSA) of within- versus between-category processing, a sliding window of 200 ms (in steps
of 10 ms) was applied to the 0.5 Hz high-pass filtered raw EEG data to obtain, for each trial, a series of 8-channel-by-41-time points
Current Biology 28, 948–954.e1–e4, March 19, 2018
e3
 (200 Hz/5 ms sampling rate) EEG feature vectors [36]. Using these feature vectors, Spearman correlations were then used to quantify,
for each time point, the representational similarity across all pairwise combinations of trials, resulting in an n trials x n trials correlation
matrix. This matrix is symmetrical around the diagonal, and all cells below the diagonal as well as the diagonal itself were removed.
Additionally, same-adjective correlations across multiple cueing rounds were removed (that is, we excluded correlations between
e.g., adjective x, cueing round 1 and adjective x, cueing round 2). Next, within-category similarity was obtained by averaging across
all remaining object-object and scene-scene cells. Between-category similarity was obtained by averaging across all object-scene
cells. The numbers of within-category and between-category cells were equated by randomly sub-selecting cells from the majority
class in each participant. Each participant’s within-category and between-category correlation time series were Fisher z-transformed
to adjust for non-normality of correlation coefficients.
All ERP, TFR and RSA analyses were performed as random-effects analyses (paired-samples t tests) and corrected for multiple
comparisons using FieldTrip’s nonparametric cluster-based permutation method (1000 randomizations), including channel x time
(ERP), channel x time x frequency (TFR) and time (RSA) as cluster-defining features. The statistical significance threshold was set
at p < .05.
EEG Event Detection
Sleep data were partitioned according to the time (minutes) spent in each stage of sleep (N1, N2, N3 and REM sleep). Data scored as
N2 or N3 were extracted from all EEG channels for spindle and slow oscillation analysis. For spindles, data were first bandpass
filtered from 10-13 Hz (slow spindles) or 13-16 Hz (fast spindles) using a 4th order two-pass Butterworth filter. We focus on
13-16 Hz because the significant cluster resulting from contrasting old cues versus control stimuli starts at 13 Hz (Figure 3B).
Although that cluster slightly leaks into higher frequencies up to 19 Hz, we set 16 Hz as the upper limit to conform to the more con-
ventional 12-16 Hz band for fast spindles [37]. Next, we took the envelope of the resulting signal and determined an amplitude
threshold as mean + 1.25 SD. A spindle was then defined as an event that surpassed that threshold for a minimum of 0.5 s and a
maximum of 3 s. For SO detection, data were filtered from 0.5-2 Hz using a 4th order two-pass Butterworth filter. Next, zeros cross-
ings were detected in the resulting signal and events with two successive positive-to-negative crossings spanning 0.8-2 s were taken
forward to the next step. Here, the resulting candidate events’ trough and trough-to-peak amplitudes were calculated and events
surpassing mean + 1.25 SD of both these metrics were considered SOs. In both event detection procedures, automatically detected
artifact samples (see above) were padded for ± 1 s and those samples were excluded prior to event detection.
SO-Spindle Coupling
For determining the preferred phase of SO-spindle modulation, we first identified spindles whose maximum occurred from 1.5-2.5 s
after onset of old memory cues (encompassing the interval in which we observed the spindle increase, Figure 3B). We then extracted
a ± 1.5 s raw data segment around the spindle maximum (accommodating the maximum spindle duration of 3 s) and created one
signal by filtering the data between 0.5 and 2 Hz and another signal by filtering the data between 13 and 16 Hz. For the lower fre-
quency signal, instantaneous phase was extracted via the Hilbert transform. For the higher frequency signal, phase of the power en-
velope was extracted, again using the Hilbert transform. For each sample (601 samples, i.e., 3 s at 200 Hz sampling rate), the circular
distance between the two phase time series was calculated and the mean resulting angle (‘preferred phase’) determined. For
instance, if the spindle amplitude were to systematically peak at the SO down state (trough), the preferred phase would be 180�.
Conversely, if the spindle amplitude was to – as hypothesized - systematically peak at the SO up state (peak), the preferred phase
would be 0� (see also [25, 38]). Each participant’s preferred phase of SO-spindle modulation was obtained from averaging all indi-
vidual events’ preferred phases, and the resulting distribution across participants was then tested against uniformity (Rayleigh test)
as well as against uniformity with an a priori defined mean direction (V test).
