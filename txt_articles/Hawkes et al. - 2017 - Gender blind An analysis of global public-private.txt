Gender blind? An analysis of global public-
private partnerships for health

Abstract
Background: The Global Public Private Partnerships for Health (GPPPH) constitute an increasingly central part of
the global health architecture and carry both financial and normative power. Gender is an important determinant
of health status, influencing differences in exposure to health determinants, health behaviours, and the response of
the health system.
We identified 18 GPPPH - defined as global institutions with a formal governance mechanism which includes both
public and private for-profit sector actors – and conducted a gender analysis of each.
Results: Gender was poorly mainstreamed through the institutional functioning of the partnerships. Half of these
partnerships had no mention of gender in their overall institutional strategy and only three partnerships had a
specific gender strategy. Fifteen governing bodies had more men than women – up to a ratio of 5:1. Very few
partnerships reported sex-disaggregated data in their annual reports or coverage/impact results. The majority of
partnerships focused their work on maternal and child health and infectious and communicable diseases – none
addressed non-communicable diseases (NCDs) directly, despite the strong role that gender plays in determining
risk for the major NCD burdens.
Conclusions: We propose two areas of action in response to these findings. First, GPPPH need to become serious
in how they “do” gender; it needs to be mainstreamed through the regular activities, deliverables and systems of
accountability. Second, the entire global health community needs to pay greater attention to tackling the major
burden of NCDs, including addressing the gendered nature of risk. Given the inherent conflicts of interest in
tackling the determinants of many NCDs, it is debatable whether the emergent GPPPH model will be an
appropriate one for addressing NCDs.
Keywords: Global public private partnerships for health, Gender, Mainstreaming, Non-communicable diseases
Background
Gender is an important determinant of health status –
influencing, at a minimum, rates of risk-exposure to
common drivers of ill-health, health-care seeking pat-
terns, and the nature of the health system’s response to
illness. It is with the latter that we are concerned in this
paper. We focus on global public-private partnerships
for health (GPPPH) since they are an important compo-
nent of the global health architecture, are seen as having
significantly increased the resources available for global
health [1–4], and are promoted by some as offering crit-
ical opportunities to improve “efficiency, equity, value
for money, and outcomes in global public health” [5].
Moreover, the public-private partnership approach has
been encouraged as a mechanism for overcoming fail-
ures of both market and state [6] as well promoting effi-
ciency in service delivery [6] and innovation in and
access to technological resources [7]. Given the import-
ance of the GPPPH model within global health activities,
and the central role that gender plays as a determinant
of health, the question we address in our paper is how
and to what extent the GPPPH focus on issues of gender
within their priorities, policies and programmes.
The GPPPH have become increasingly powerful actors
within global health: funds allocated to the two largest
GPPPH (Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria –
GFATM- and GAVI) have increased from US$1.67 bil-
lion to US$4.9 billion over the 10-year period 2005 and

 2015 – an almost three-fold rise. In total, these two part-
nerships currently receive 14% of external global health
financing [8]. Nonetheless, the partnership model has
been criticised as implying privatisation by stealth [9], of
disrupting the focus and governance of country level
health systems [10–12], of unduly influencing inter-
national norm-setting [13, 14] and of promoting an
overly narrow technical focus on solutions for health
problems [15, 16] . Notwithstanding such criticism,
public-private-interaction is likely to grow across all sec-
tors, including health, as countries and international or-
ganisations
mobilise
to
achieve
the
sustainable
development goals (SDG) by 2030. The United Nations
Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development actively advo-
cates for countries to “Encourage and promote effective
public, public-private and civil society partnerships,
building on the experience and resourcing strategies of
partnerships.” [17] . Moreover, the Addis Ababa Agenda
on Financing For Development identifies a critical role
of private finance for development, including through
the mechanism of public-private partnerships [18].
Although there are no agreed upon definitions of
GPPPH [19] a commonly used definition was proposed
by Buse and Harmer as “relatively institutionalised initia-
tives, established to address global health problems, in
which public and for-profit private sector organisations
have a voice in collective decision-making.” [20] We use
this definition for identifying GPPPH for inclusion in
our analysis.
Gender is recognised as a significant driver of health
outcomes – both as an influence in its own right, and
through its interaction with other determinants of in-
equity and vulnerability. Payne [21] has characterized
gender influences on health in three domains: differ-
ences in exposure to social determinants of health (e.g.,
poverty or the health risks of employment); health be-
haviours (e.g., diet, tobacco or alcohol use, patterns of
care seeking); and the response of the health system to
the different needs of men and women.
Despite the profound influence that gender exerts on
health, the ability of global health institutions to recog-
nise, understand and address the influence of gender on
health outcomes has been characterised as “missing,
misunderstood
and
sometimes
mainstreamed”
[22].
Gender mainstreaming - a strategy for promoting gender
equity through “research, legislation, policy development
and in activities on the ground” [23] - has been part of
global policy discourse for more than 35 years [24] and
the United Nations (UN) Economic and Social Council
agreed to mainstream a gender perspective in all UN
policies and programmes with the ultimate goal of gen-
der equality [25] . The concept and practice of gender
mainstreaming is contested. Critics in particular empha-
sise how an ‘integrationist’ and ‘technocratic’ approach
adopted by state and international bureaucracies, waters
down its transformative intent [26]. Yet, the contribu-
tions of GM in placing gender as “a critical axis of
power” (ibid) and improving effectiveness of policies “by
making visible the gendered nature of assumptions, pro-
cesses and outcomes” [27] are widely acknowledged.
Reviews of how international health organisations “do
gender” have predominantly focused on major intergov-
ernmental agencies [21] and to date there have been few
evaluations of how the GPPPH take gender equity into
account when prioritising the focus of their work, their
governance structures, or their ways of implementing ac-
tivities. Hanefeld et al. reviewed the impact of three glo-
bal health initiatives on health equity, with a specific
focus on HIV and women, but concluded that there was
little evidence of long-term impact on equity [28]. More
recently, Gideon and Porter reviewed public-private
partnerships with an emphasis on women’s health, and
noted the lack of evaluation of partnerships with respect
to their impact on various aspects of equity, including
gender [29].
Within this paper we take a holistic approach to gen-
der equity in health and analyse how the GPPPH address
gender– both as a determinant of health, and as an in-
fluence on health system priorities. We use the method-
ology of gender analysis to systematically identify and
critically appraise gender policies and commitments of
GHPPP to assess key gaps and address gender related
health inequities [30].
Methods
We included 18 GPPPH that fit the definition of Buse
and Harmer [20]. The partnerships were identified from
previous publications, WHO documents on partnerships
and collaboration [31], and from email communications
with experts in public private partnerships, global health
and global health governance. We also posted a question
on Twitter to try and identify partnerships fitting the
Buse/Harmer definition (and identified one GPPPH this
way). We did not include public-private partnerships
that operate only at national (or sub-national) levels, or
those partnerships that do not have a formal governance
mechanism that includes both the public sector and the
for-profit private sector.
We conducted a gender analysis of the priorities, focus
and institutional mechanisms of each of the 18 GPPPH.
The analysis relied upon reviewing the publicly-available
documents from each partnership found on their web-
sites. We analysed the following: references to or work-
ing definition of gender used by the GPPPH; presence of
a specific gender strategy; gender breakdown of the gov-
erning board; presentation of gender-disaggregated ser-
vice delivery and/or health outcome and impact data.
We reviewed the make-up of the governing boards, and
Hawkes et al. Globalization and Health  (2017) 13:26

 categorised board members as belonging to: the public
sector, i.e., national government or multilateral system;
the private for-profit sector; or “other” – i.e., academics,
representatives of Foundations, non-governmental or
civil society organisations, consultants (including now
retired staff from other sectors), and people whose affili-
ations were not fully clear.1 In some cases, people shifted
their position from representing public to private sectors
(occasionally, vice-versa) as they changed jobs; we cate-
gorized them according to their current official position.
Our methodological approach to analyzing the extent
to which gender is mainstreamed within health institu-
tions predominantly focused on the extent to which a
gender perspective is incorporated into organizational
governance, structure and policies [32, 33]. Moving be-
yond this established approach, we were additionally
concerned with the extent to which gender played a part
in institutional priorities – were the GPPPH addressing
the impact of gender on the overall illness burden? As a
final methodological step, we compared the focus of the
18 GPPPH with the current evidence of global burden of
disease, disaggregated by sex, and reviewed whether the
GPPPH address the main determinants of morbidity,
mortality and well-being. In Figs. 1 (men) and 2
(women) we mapped GPPPH focus on to the global bur-
den of disease charts produced by the Institute for
Health Metrics and Evaluation [34]. These charts show
the proportional distribution of burden of disease, as
measured by disability adjusted life years (DALYs), and
are divided (by IHME) into three categories: non-
communicable diseases including mental health (left
hand side of Figure); maternal and communicable dis-
eases (top right); and violence and injury (bottom right).
The logos of each GPPPH are mapped onto the burden
of disease charts. Exact mapping was not possible since
many of the partnerships cover several health problems
(e.g., developing new diagnostics for infectious diseases,
delivering vaccines against infection, or improving ma-
ternal health), but the placement of partnership logos
gives a general idea of the main areas of work.
Results
A full list of these GPPPH is given in Table 1 along with
their main focus area of work – mainly covering product

 development and access; strengthening systems includ-
ing health systems; or addressing the underlying deter-
minants of ill-health.
Table 2 presents the results of the gender analysis of
the 18 GPPPH. Three partnerships (GAVI, Global Fund
for AIDS, TB and Malaria – The Global Fund - and Glo-
bal Alliance for Clean Cookstoves) had a specific gender
strategy, although the understanding of gender varied
significantly across the three. For GAVI, gender was de-
fined as “the characteristics of women and men which
are socially constructed” while the Global Alliance for
Clean Cookstoves emphasised the need to focus their
work on girls and women. The Global Fund in its Gen-
der Equality Strategy [35] commits to fund proposals
“that scale up services and interventions that reduce
gender-related risks and vulnerabilities to infection …
and address structural inequalities and discrimination”.
The Global Fund was the only partnership to highlight
the
specific
needs
of
transgender
populations
(see
Table 2) in a policy document, although the Stop TB/
UNAIDS Gender Assessment Tool includes transgender
health issues as a focus area.
The Stop TB Partnership did not have a published
gender strategy, but its overall strategy document de-
fined gender-sensitive policies and gender-specific ap-
proaches and stressed that these should “strengthen the
response to fulfil the right to health of women and girls,
men and boys in all their diversity” [36] . Stop TB,
jointly with UNAIDS, has recently released a gender as-
sessment tool to assess country-level HIV and TB epi-
demics and guide development of gender sensitive and
transformative responses [37].
A further five GPPPH (GAIN, RBM, SUN, Micronu-
trient Initiative and PMNCH) specifically mentioned
gender and the health of women and girls in their over-
all strategy document. None of these partnerships in-
cluded any mention of a specific focus on the health of
men and boys.
Half the GPPPH (AERAS, DNDi, FIND, Global Health
Innovative Technology Fund, The Global Road Safety
Partnership, International Vaccine Institute, Medicines
for Malaria Venture, TB Alliance and the Global PPP for
Handwashing) made no mention of gender in their over-
all strategy, had no gender strategy, and did not allude

 to the specific health needs of women and girls or men
and boys.
The governing bodies of identified GPPPH contained
between 8 and 27 members; only one partnership (Part-
nership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health) had
equal numbers of women (n = 12) and men (n = 12) on
its board, while Stop TB was close to parity with 12
women and 13 men. For one partnership (Handwashing)
it was not possible to identify the gender breakdown of
the board since the website listed organisations rather
than individuals, and its secretariat did not respond to
our request for information. The other 15 partnerships
had governing bodies with more men than women, with
a gender ratio of up to five times more men than women
(Roll Back Malaria). GAVI was the only partnership with
a stated policy of gender equality on its governing board,

 and they have 15 men and 12 women. Of note, women
from the private sector were proportionally more under-
represented than women in public/other sectors and ten of
the 18 boards had no female private sector representation.
Very few of the partnerships reported sex- or gender-
disaggregated data in their annual reports or available
coverage/impact results. Since 2014, GAVI requires
countries to specify when their proposals target a
gender-related barrier to immunisation (specified by
39% of proposals to date) and the Scaling Up Nutrition
partnership 2015 report mentions that 22 countries have
gender responsive allocations, with nutrition data re-
ported for women but not men. The Micronutrient Ini-
tiative details the number of women reached through its
work. None of the partnerships which focus on the
health of infants and children (e.g., through nutritional
support or vaccines) provide sex-disaggregated data.
The 18 GPPPH ranged in focus from single issue (e.g.,
development of a vaccine) to population-wide (e.g., focus
on health of mothers and children), with particular at-
tention paid to infectious and communicable diseases in
childhood. The majority of the initiatives (12/18) were
concerned with the infectious and communicable dis-
eases, three partnerships focused on nutrition (particu-
larly malnutrition and deficiencies), and one was cross-
cutting (Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child
Health). None of the partnerships addressed the non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) directly, but two of
these addressed their determinants: the Global Alliance
for Clean Cookstoves (focus on reducing indoor air pol-
lution), and the Global Road Safety Partnership (working
to reduce road-crash deaths and injuries).
Discussion
Global public private partnerships in health have trans-
formed the global health landscape over the past 20+
years, and the role of these partnerships has recently
been strengthened with the adoption of the Agenda for
Sustainable Development, which also commits the global
community to achieving gender equality and empower-
ment of all women and girls (Goal 5). GPPPH are an im-
portant, although contested, component of the global
response to contemporary global health challenges and
several calls have been made to evaluate their effective-
ness and the equity implications of the work they fund
[38, 39] . Such evaluation, we argue, should include an
analysis of how GPPPH perceive and address underlying
social and structural determinants of health – including
gender inequality and discrimination.
We found that gender is most often absent from the
core strategies and policies of GPPPH, or, if present, sug-
gest a wide variation in the understanding of gender -
largely conceived as pertaining to women and girls. Such
focus manifests in recognition of increased vulnerability
of women and girls to ill-health (e.g., GAIN, Global Alli-
ance for Clean Cookstoves, Micronutrient Initiative),
women/girls’ lack of agency to redress a health problem
(GAIN), or the higher care burden that often falls upon
girls and women (Roll Back Malaria). Stop TB is one of
the very few partnerships promoting the use of a
gender-assessment tool to guide its work, yet its country
level data is not disaggregated for gender specific differ-
ences in risks, health seeking and programme outreach.
The Global Fund’s gender strategy is strong in its commit-
ment to addressing gender inequalities that fuel the HIV
epidemic (with a focus on women and girls), yet evaluation
of its implementation and monitoring indicators suggests a
major gap between policy intent and practice with too few
grant agreements found to specify, fund or monitor
gender-sensitive or transformative activities [40, 41].
The majority of GPPPH, however, are gender blind in
their approach to health and lack simple mechanisms for
enhancing gender accountability. Three notable omissions
and gaps to gender transformative global health policies
and programmes emerge from our analysis.
First, the vast majority of partnerships were governed by
boards with unequal gender ratios (Table 1). The skewed
composition of governing bodies of GPPPH, reflected in
the conspicuous invisibility of women, reinforces concerns
around tokenistic pursuit of goals of representation and
rights by global health actors [42] and raises concerns for
accountable governance in global health.
Second, the majority of GPPPH fail to report or publish
sex-disaggregated data on coverage, outcomes or impact
of the programmes they fund (Table 2). Where gender
specific outcomes are reported, these are largely restricted
to presenting what percentage of beneficiaries are women
and girls. Such a view is not only limiting but may be
counterproductive to tackling the underlying determi-
nants of the global burden of disease. Sex and age data
disaggregation on risk exposure, prevention and treatment
coverage and outcomes are essential for understanding ill-
health, ensuring investments are reaching those with high-
est need, and monitoring impact – including impact on
reducing gender-based gaps in coverage and outcomes.
Such information is vital to the work of ensuring that no-
one is left behind in global health. For example, a system-
atic analysis of global incidence and mortality associated
with HIV, TB and malaria over more than two decades
found that mortality rates were higher in males than fe-
males for all three infections, while incidence rates were
higher in females for malaria, higher in men for TB, and
approximately equal for HIV [43] . A gendered interpret-
ation of this picture may conclude that programmes con-
cerned with gender norms around treatment seeking and
health care coverage will need to include a focus on higher
mortality rates in men (as an indicator of lower access to
care) – but among our sample of partnerships, only Stop

 TB seems to be concerned with this dimension of gender.
Holding GPPPH to account for gender and health out-
comes means, at a minimum, having up-to-date sex-
disaggregated data on coverage and outcomes.
Third, as shown in the two Figures, the partnerships have
clustered the focus of their work on maternal health, child
health and communicable/infectious diseases. The absence
of any substantial body of GPPPH activity in addressing the
highest burdens of disease (i.e., the non-communicable dis-
eases and violence and injuries) represents a gross failure
not only of evidence-informed resource allocation, but also
a failure to recognize the gendered nature of health risks
and suffering. Large proportions of the NCDs and their
underlying risk behaviours, are currently more common in
men and boys (e.g., diseases associated with tobacco, alco-
hol, occupational health exposures) [44] but rates of expos-
ure are rising in women [45] – and will soon be followed
by increased incidence of NCD-related ill-health. It has
been argued (including by us [22]) that much of this risk
behavior is influenced by profit-driven industries (e.g., con-
sumption of tobacco [42], alcohol [43], highly processed
foods [46]). Failure to address these areas signals a major
abrogation of responsibility from the global health commu-
nity. This lack of attention echoes the wider criticism
of GHPPPs that the business-orientation endorsed by
them has a bias for ‘safe issues’ [47] and narrow tech-
nical or ‘magic bullet’ approaches over tackling struc-
tural
and
more
complex
upstream
determinants,
including gender power relations [4, 15].
Conclusions
The GPPPH are important players in global health. They
constitute a major source of funding for health pro-
grammes in low- and middle-income countries, and
exert influence over health decision-making at national
and global levels. Therefore, understanding how the
GPPPH address gender - a key determinant of health
outcomes - raises legitimate issues of priority-setting, re-
source allocation and accountability.
Our finding of a widespread lack of a gender-aware ap-
proach within these partnerships is not unexpected, as
similar results have been found in reviews of other major
global health institutions [21, 22]. Nonetheless, gender
equity should be central to the work that they do. Gen-
der drives not only the risk of exposure to an illness-
determinant, but also has a major influence over the
likelihood that appropriate prevention, care and treat-
ment services will be either sought, offered or received.
Of equal and potentially greater concern, is the finding
of an almost total absence of GPPPH activity to address
the gendered nature of major health risks being faced by
both women and men globally – in light of the growing
burden of NCDs.
We believe that two lines of action are now needed.
First, the existing GPPPH need to become more serious
about how they “do gender”. It is not sufficient to men-
tion girls and women in advocacy documents. Instead,
a relational perspective on gender needs to be main-
streamed through the regular activities, deliverables
and systems of accountability of all GPPPH – from
boardroom to delivery/access to health services, gender
needs to be fully taken into account.
Second the global health community needs to place
much greater emphasis on tackling the major burdens
of NCDs, including the gendered nature of risk for
many of the NCDs. Whether GPPPH are the most ap-
propriate model for tackling NCDs remains open to
question. Given the key role that the private sector
plays in determining the nature of risk (including
manufacturing gendered risks) of exposure to health-
reducing products, there is a strong argument for the
need for interaction between global health communities
and private companies. However, the broad yet specific
challenge is how to manage the risks inherent in such
interactions [48], mitigate conflicts of interest, and en-
sure that population health is protected [49] while also
addressing the gendered nature of health determinants
and health system responses.
