ith research providing evidence suggesting that 
long-term neurocognitive deficits may result 
from repetitive sports-related concussions, these 
injuries have become a cause for widespread public con-
cern.21,29 Of all sports, football accounts for the highest 
incidence of concussion.19,20,31 Exposure to head impacts 
in football has been shown to result in neurocognitive and 
brain changes even in the absence of clinically diagnosed 
concussion.1,18,30 Most research quantifying head impact 
exposure in football has focused on high school, collegiate, 
or professional populations, despite the fact that youth 
football players represent 70% of all players in the United 
States.4–6,9,14,22,24–26,28 Proper teaching and rule modification 
are considered to be effective methods for limiting head 
impact exposure and mitigating concussions in football.13

OBJECTIVE Even in the absence of a clinically diagnosed concussion, research suggests that neurocognitive changes 
may develop in football players as a result of frequent head impacts that occur during football games and practices. The 
objectives of this study were to determine the specific situations in which high-magnitude impacts (accelerations exceed-
ing 40g) occur in youth football games and practices and to assess how representative practice activities are of games 
with regard to high-magnitude head impact exposure.
METHODS A total of 45 players (mean age 10.7 ± 1.1 years) on 2 youth teams (Juniors [mean age 9.9 ± 0.6 years; 
mean body mass 38.9 ± 9.9 kg] and Seniors [mean age 11.9 ± 0.6 years; mean body mass 51.4 ± 11.8 kg]) wore helmets 
instrumented with accelerometer arrays to record head impact accelerations for all practices and games. Video record-
ings from practices and games were used to verify all high-magnitude head impacts, identify specific impact characteris-
tics, and determine the amount of time spent in each activity.
RESULTS A total of 7590 impacts were recorded, of which 571 resulted in high-magnitude head impact accelerations 
exceeding 40g (8%). Impacts were characterized based on the position played by the team member who received the 
impact, the part of the field where the impact occurred, whether the impact occurred during a game or practice play, and 
the cause of the impact. High-magnitude impacts occurred most frequently in the open field in both games (59.4%) and 
practices (67.5%). “Back” position players experienced a greater proportion of high-magnitude head impacts than players 
at other positions. The 2 teams in this study structured their practice sessions similarly with respect to time spent in each 
drill, but impact rates differed for each drill between the teams.
CONCLUSIONS High-magnitude head impact exposure in games and practice drills was quantified and used as the 
basis for comparison of exposure in the 2 settings. In this cohort, game impact rates exceeded those for practice. Back 
players, who were often positioned in the open field, were shown to experience elevated levels of head impact exposure 
relative to players at other positions. The analysis also suggests that practice intensity, which may be influenced by 
coaching style, may also affect high-magnitude head impact exposure. Future studies should investigate this aspect as a 
factor affecting head impact exposure.

posure in youth football players, which were instituted by 
the Pop Warner youth football organization.16 Following 
these changes, it was observed that head impact exposure 
was reduced by as much as 40% by limiting player-to-
player contact in practice.10 A classification system used 
to assess the number and severity of high-magnitude im-
pacts occurring in specific practice drills demonstrated 
that most tackling drills were associated with a greater 
impact severity than was game play8 and confirmed previ-
ous research indicating that the magnitude and frequency 
of head impacts were lower in youth players than in older 
players.8,10,16,17,26,32,33
Quantification of impact exposure for games, to this 
point, has been limited to either frequency or impacts per 
game.10,14,16,17,24,33 Although this research has been invalu-
able in promoting player safety, it has provided a largely 
superficial investigation into the circumstances surround-
ing game impacts, specifically those of a high magnitude. 
These high-acceleration impacts are associated with a 
greater risk of concussion than lower-acceleration im-
pacts.27 With a valuable framework already in place to 
assess head impact exposure in football practices,8 the pri-
mary objective of this study was to quantify and compare 
high-magnitude impact exposure in games and practices. 
In addition, we sought to characterize impacts on the basis 
of the position played by the team member who received 
the impact, the part of the field where the impact occurred, 
whether the impact occurred during game or practice play, 
and the cause of the impact. Knowledge of the specific im-
pact scenarios that most frequently occur in games would 
allow coaches and leagues to make changes that reduce 
player risk, such as identifying and eliminating practice 
drills associated with high-risk impact scenarios not ob-
served in games. These data have applications toward 
improving player safety in youth football by developing 
interventions that limit head impact exposure.
Methods
Study Participants 
Two youth football teams composed of 9- to 12-year-
old players were included in this study, which was ap-
proved by Virginia Tech’s institutional review board. All 
participants verbally assented to study participation, and 
their guardians provided written consent. A total of 45 
players chose to participate and received helmets instru-
mented with accelerometer arrays (Head Impact Telem-
etry [HIT] System, Simbex). Players on the junior team 
(Juniors) had a mean age of 9.9 ± 0.6 years and a mean 
body mass of 38.9 ± 9.9 kg. Players on the senior team 
(Seniors) had a mean age of 11.9 ± 0.6 years and a mean 
body mass of 51.4 ± 11.8 kg. Overall, data were collected 
from 55 practice sessions and 14 games. There were 25 
junior team practices and 30 senior team practices, and 
both teams played 7 games.
Data Acquisition
All players were provided with a Riddell Revolution or 
Speed helmet with a 6-accelerometer array mounted in-
side. To ensure measurements of head acceleration, and 
not helmet acceleration, the accelerometers are spring 
mounted to maintain contact with the head throughout 
the impact.23 Players wore the instrumented helmets at 
each practice and game throughout the season. Data ac-
quisition for impacts was automatically triggered when 
an individual channel exceeded a 14.4g threshold. A 10g 
resultant acceleration threshold was used to distinguish 
between impact events and acceleration levels associated 
with nonimpact events. Impact data, which were transmit-
ted wirelessly from the helmets to a sideline computer, 
were processed to compute linear and rotational resultant 
accelerations.11,28
Games and practices were filmed to facilitate video 
verification of head impacts. Any impact exceeding 40g 
was categorized as a high-magnitude impact, which is 
consistent with previous studies, and represented the top 
8% of all impacts recorded. All high-magnitude head im-
pacts were visually verified to identify the scenario asso-
ciated with the head impact. Activity logs recorded by re-
searchers who were present for each session were used to 
parse out false impacts, which were most often associated 
with players dropping their helmets on the ground during 
breaks in action. Game video was also used to develop of-
fensive and defensive play counts for each player.
All high-magnitude impacts were classified as occur-
ring either in the open field or at the line of scrimmage. 
Open field impacts were defined as those that occurred 
outside the zone where the offensive linemen were posi-
tioned at the snap. Line of scrimmage impacts occurred 
within this zone.
Beyond this categorization, the causes of high-magni-
tude practice and game impacts were classified based on 
the role of the player who experienced the impact during 
the play in which the high-magnitude impact occurred. 
Four specific roles were identified during which players 
experienced head impacts: Blocked, Blocker, Tackled, 
and Tackler. “Blocked” refers to impacts experienced by a 
player who was blocked by an opposing player. “Blocker” 
refers to impacts experienced by a player who blocked an 
opposing player. “Tackled” refers to impacts experienced 
by a player who was tackled by an opposing player while 
carrying the ball. “Tackler” refers to impacts experienced 
by a player who tackled an opposing player who was car-
rying the ball. Seven isolated, high-magnitude game im-
pacts were attributed to fumbles. In these impacts, the 
football was dropped by a player and nearby players dove 
to the ground to attempt to retrieve the ball. These im-
pacts could not be grouped with any other impact cause 
and were excluded from analysis because there were too 
few for meaningful comparisons.
High-magnitude practice impacts were categorized 
according to the practice activity at the time of impact. 
Generalized practice activities for the teams in this study 
consisted of “Offense vs Defense,” “Tackling—No Block-
er,” “Tackling—Blocker,” and “Blocking.”8 Offense vs 
Defense represents all practice activities in which a team’s 
offense and defense opposed each other. These took the 
form of intra- and intersquad 11-versus-11 scrimmages, as 
well as smaller-scale (5-vs-5 or 6-vs-6) scrimmages. Tack-
ling—No Blocker consists of drills in which ball carriers 
and tacklers oppose each other without a blocker present. 
Tackling—Blocker represents a permutation of the previ-

ous drill, with the notable difference that a blocker is pres-
ent. Blocking consists of drills primarily aimed at practic-
ing blocking or block shedding, skills that simulate work 
on the offensive or defensive line. These 4 generalized 
categories encompassed nearly all of the scenarios dur-
ing which high-magnitude head impacts were observed in 
practice. Six high-magnitude practice impacts occurred in 
unique activities that could not be grouped into the previ-
ous categories and were excluded from analysis because 
there were too few for meaningful comparisons.
Players were assigned to 1 of 3 position groups, corre-
sponding to their roles on the field (Table 1). Youth players 
generally play both offense and defense at similar posi-
tions. According to traditional football positions, offensive 
linemen and defensive linemen would be considered simi-
lar, and running backs and linebackers would be consid-
ered similar.
The number of high-magnitude impacts and impact 
rates were compared between games, practice as a whole, 
and specific practice drills. Using video from practices 
and games, the amount of time spent participating in 
each practice drill or game was determined. Because the 
amount of time spent in each activity and the number of 
impacts differed between the teams and between practices 
and games, impact rates, measured in high-magnitude im-
pacts per hour, were used for comparisons.
Statistical Analysis
Byar’s method was used to develop 95% CIs for the 
impact rates in this study. This method retains accuracy 
when comparing large and small values, which were an 
aspect of this study.3 Impact rates were determined for 
each team for open field and line of scrimmage impacts, 
specific causes of impacts, and specific football activities 
(i.e., practice drills, overall practice, and games). Statis-
tical significance for differences in impact rates was de-
fined by nonoverlapping 95% CIs. For each practice drill, 
ANCOVA was used to determine the effects of the factors 
position and team on high-magnitude head impact expo-
sure, while controlling for the continuous covariates of age, 
weight, and number of practices. A log transformation of 
high-magnitude impact counts was used to satisfy the as-
sumption of normality, no interactions were assumed, and 
Type II sums of squares were computed for each factor.
Results
A total of 7590 impacts were recorded and verified, 
2057 of which occurred during games (Table 2). Among 
all impacts, 571 (8%) exceeded 40g and were considered 
to be high magnitude. These high-magnitude impacts 
were composed of 381 (67%) practice impacts and 190 
(33%) game impacts. Game impacts exceeding 40g rep-
resented approximately the top 10% of all game impacts 
for players in this study. Among game impacts, 114 were 
classified as open field impacts, with the remaining 76 as 
line of scrimmage impacts. Among practice impacts, 263 
were open field impacts and 118 were line of scrimmage 
impacts. In practice, Offense vs Defense drills resulted in 
numbers of impacts similar to those occurring in games. 
Practice drills varied in the breakdown of open field and 
line of scrimmage impacts, as well as in terms of impact 
cause (Fig. 1).
Differences between the 2 teams were observed for 
high-magnitude impacts. Juniors had 65 high-magnitude 
head impacts (37%) in 7 games and 113 in 25 practice 
sessions, whereas Seniors had 125 (32%) in 7 games and 
268 in 30 practice sessions. Juniors experienced 62 open 
field impacts (33%) and 126 line of scrimmage impacts. 
Seniors experienced 315 open field impacts (80%) and 78 
line of scrimmage impacts.
High-Magnitude Head Impact Exposure in Games
Most high-magnitude head impacts occurred in players 
in the Back positions (Table 3). On average, these players 
had the most playing time and experienced high-magni-
tude impacts at a higher rate. Increased playing time was 
associated with an increase in high-magnitude head im-
pacts (Line group: R2 = 0.304, p = 0.0176; Back group: R2 
= 0.724, p = 0.0001). The average Back player participated 
in 273 plays and experienced 9 high-magnitude head im-
pacts, whereas the average Line player participated in 225 
plays with 4 high-magnitude head impacts (Fig. 2).
Overall, a majority (59.4%) of game impacts were ob-
served to occur in the open field. Juniors experienced only 
28 open field impacts, compared with 37 line of scrim-
mage impacts. Seniors experienced 86 open field impacts 
and 39 line of scrimmage impacts. Impact cause was as-
sociated with a player’s position, in that Line players expe-
rienced a greater proportion of impacts related to blocking 
(Blocker or Blocked), whereas Back players experienced a 
greater proportion related to tackling (Tackler or Tackled). 
Most game impacts for Juniors (61.5%) were associated 
with blocking, whereas tackling impacts (65.6%) repre-
sented the majority for Seniors.
Comparison of High-Magnitude Head Impact Exposure in 
Practices and Games
Back players experienced a majority of high-magnitude 
impacts related to tackling (72.3%), whereas Line players 
experienced most impacts due to blocking (70.9%) (Table 
4). Line players experienced most high-magnitude head 
impacts at the line of scrimmage (66.3%), whereas Back 
players generally experienced impacts in the open field 
(82.6%). This was observed to be true for both teams for 
both games and practices. Junior Line players tended to 
experience high-magnitude head impacts associated with 
blocking (92.5%), while a majority of practice impacts for 
Senior Line players were related to tackling (55.1%). The 
2 teams in this study experienced similar numbers of im-
pacts related to blocking.

The number of high-magnitude head impacts varied between activity, team, and position. Players who played more in general experienced a higher number of high-
magnitude impacts in both practices and games.

Both teams experienced higher impact rates in games 
(Juniors 95% CI: 6.2–10.2 impacts/hour, and Seniors 95% 
CI: 12.2–17.5 impacts/hour) relative to the overall practice 
(Juniors 95% CI: 2.5–3.6 impacts/hour, and Seniors 95% 
CI: 3.9–5.0 impacts/hour) (Fig. 3). For line of scrimmage 
impacts in games, the 2 teams did not differ in impact 
rate (Juniors 95% CI: 3.2–6.3 impacts/hour and Seniors 
95% CI: 3.3–6.3 impacts/hour). However, Seniors experi-
enced a higher rate of open field game impacts (95% CI: 
8.1–12.5 impacts/hour) than Juniors (95% CI: 2.3–5.0 im-
pacts/hour).
The percentage of all impacts that were high magnitude 
was determined for both teams and session types. Seniors 
had a higher percentage of high-magnitude impacts for 
both practices and games than Juniors. In practice, 4.5% 
of all impacts for Juniors were high magnitude, whereas 
9.0% of practice impacts for Seniors exceeded 40g. For 
games, 6.6% and 11.4% of impacts for Juniors and Se-
niors, respectively, were categorized as high magnitude. 
High-magnitude impacts were 47% more likely to occur 
in a game than during practice for the Juniors (95% CI: 
9.8%–98.5%), compared with 27% for the Seniors (95% 
CI: 4.0%–55.3%).

resulted in an impact rate (95% CI: 6.3–10.0 impacts/hour) 
that was consistent with that observed in games (95% CI: 
6.2–10.2 impacts/hour). Seniors (95% CI: 12.2–17.5 im-
pacts/hour) experienced nearly double the impact rate in 
games that Juniors (95% CI: 6.2–10.2 impacts/hour) expe-
rienced. The Tackling—No Blocker drill (95% CI: 30.2–
42.9 impacts/hour) was associated with the highest impact 
rate of all football activities for Seniors (Fig. 3). For the 
Tackling—No Blocker drill, position (p = 0.004) and team 
(p < 0.0001) had an effect on high-magnitude impact ex-
posure. Position explained 15.9% of the variance, whereas 
team explained 23.1%. For the Tackling—Blocker drill, 
neither position nor team had an effect on high-magnitude 
impact exposure. Position was observed to have an effect 
for both Offense vs Defense (p = 0.030) and Blocking 
drills (p = 0.012), explaining 12.0% and 19.5% of variance, 
respectively. For all drills, differences between individual 
players explained the majority of variance. No difference 
between impact rates for tackling drills and games was 
observed for Juniors, whereas the impact rates for tackling 
drills for Seniors were as high as or higher than in games.
Discussion
Given that in other studies youth football practices have 
been observed to be associated with a higher frequency 
of high-magnitude head impacts than games, head impact 
exposure research at the youth level has focused on efforts 
to limit practice impacts. High-magnitude head impacts 
are associated with the greatest risk for concussion.27 
Knowledge of the specific impact scenarios that most fre-
quently occur in games would allow coaches and leagues 
to construct practice drills that more effectively mimic 
these impacts rather than exposing players to more severe 
impacts than they might experience in a game.8 Although 
the proportion of high-magnitude practice impacts in our 
study (66%) is low compared with those reported for pre-
vious studies of youth players, it should be noted that this 
has been shown to be dependent on specific characteristics 
of individual teams, and that the average age of players in 
this study is older than that for youth teams in previous 
studies.8,10,16 As players age, more high-magnitude impacts 
occur during games than in practices.10
High-Magnitude Head Impact Exposure in Games
The 2 teams in this study experienced a similar num-
ber of high-magnitude line of scrimmage impacts (37 for 
Juniors and 39 for Seniors), but the proportion of game im-
pacts at the line of scrimmage differed (56.9% for Juniors 
vs 31.2% for Seniors). For both teams, Back players experi-
enced the majority of high-magnitude game impacts in the 
open field and Line players experienced a majority at the 
line of scrimmage. Players involved in open field impacts 
are able to reach greater speeds and produce higher-mag-
nitude head impacts more frequently. Among the players 
in various positions, Back players (41.5 ± 6.6 kg), who par-
ticipated in the highest number of plays on average, were 
the most active and athletic players, whereas Line players 
(52.8 ± 12.4 kg) tended to be larger. Players were generally 
exposed to high-magnitude impacts in a manner that was 
consistent with where they lined up prior to the beginning 
of the play, which reflects the influence of player position 
on the incidence of high-magnitude impacts (Fig. 2).
Each position group was associated with a distinct dis-
tribution of impact causes. Line players predominately 
experienced impacts related to blocking, whereas Back 
players experienced more tackling-related impacts. Youth 
football offenses tend to be run oriented, which means that 
usually only a few offensive players (Backs) possess the 
ball during plays. These players represent the main tar-
get for opposing players and are therefore more likely to 
experience high-magnitude impacts than are their team-
mates at other positions. Juniors experienced a majority of 
their high-magnitude game impacts due to blocking. When 
players are younger, they are more likely to bunch up. It 
is often more difficult for these players to generate much 
speed prior to impact, so tackling-related impacts for play-
ers on the Juniors team would generally be lower in mag-
nitude. The similar number of blocking impacts between 
the 2 teams would suggest that age or style of play does 
not affect the incidence of high-magnitude impacts near 
the line of scrimmage. The fact that Seniors experienced a 
much greater number and proportion of open field impacts 
than Juniors provides further evidence that player speed 
and age are factors associated with the rate and magnitude 
of head impact exposure.
Comparison of High-Magnitude Head Impact Exposure in 
Practices and Games
Regardless of whether players were participating in 
practices or games, Juniors experienced fewer high-mag-
nitude head impacts than Seniors. This finding could be 
related to any number of factors, including age and prac-
tice structure, as well as practice intensity. For both teams, 
practice was associated with a lower likelihood of high-
magnitude head impact exposure than games. For Juniors, 
1 in 15 game impacts was high magnitude, whereas for Se-
FIG. 3. Box plot showing impact rates for all football activities by team. 
For both teams, games were associated with a high-magnitude impact 
rate greater than that in practices overall. Tackling—No Blocker had the 
greatest high-magnitude impact rate among all practice drills. Impact 
rates for Seniors exceeded impact rates for Juniors for most activities.

niors 1 in 9 impacts was high magnitude. Larger and fast-
er players can deliver an impact with greater energy than 
smaller players, which would explain some of the observed 
differences in high-magnitude head impact exposure be-
tween the 2 teams. Compared with Junior practices, Senior 
practices were twice as likely to produce high-magnitude 
impacts; this difference may be attributable to increased 
intensity of the Senior practices—although difficult to 
quantify, we observed that the intensity of practices for Se-
niors was noticeably higher than that for Juniors. Practice 
structure and coaching style could expose players to more 
situations that result in high-magnitude impacts or that re-
ward players for making bigger hits, rather than safer hits, 
in player-to-player contact.
For both teams, the high-magnitude impact rate was 
increased in games compared with practices (Fig. 3). Prac-
tices had more noncontact time than games did, which 
probably contributed to some of the differences observed. 
The differences in game style between the age groups were 
manifested in a higher open field impact rate for Seniors 
(95% CI: 8.1–12.5 impacts/hour) relative to Juniors (95% 
CI: 2.3–5.0 impacts/hour). The older players had more ex-
perience playing football and were more likely to make 
plays in the open field. In games and practice, most im-
pacts for Backs were observed to be in the open field and to 
be related to tackling, whereas Line players experienced a 
majority of line of scrimmage impacts related to blocking. 
Players were exposed to impact scenarios in practice that 
were representative of game situations they would experi-
ence.
Comparison of High-Magnitude Head Impact Exposure 
Between Practice Drills and Games
Practice sessions lasted 90 minutes for Juniors and 120 
minutes for Seniors. On average, 40 minutes were devoted 
to warming up or cooling down before and after practice 
for both teams. Both teams conducted Blocking (11 min-
utes) and Offense versus Defense (23 minutes) drills for 
the same amount of time in an average practice. Juniors 
did tackling drills, with or without a blocker, for 5 min-
utes in an average practice, compared with 9 minutes for 
Seniors (Table 5). The remaining time, 10 minutes for Ju-
niors and 37 minutes for Seniors, was devoted to water 
breaks, coaching instruction, and position-specific, non-
contact drills. Not every drill was done at each practice, 
and the average practice time represents an aggregation 
over the course of the season.
On average, practice drills that produced high-magni-
tude head impacts were conducted for similar amounts of 
time between the 2 teams. The only difference was that 
Seniors conducted 4 more minutes of tackling drills than 
Juniors. It has been estimated that a 5-minute reduction in 
tackling drills could decrease the incidence of high-mag-
nitude impacts by as much as 19%.8 This slight difference 
in practice structure would not explain all of the difference 
in high-magnitude practice impacts between the 2 teams 
in this study (113 for Juniors and 268 for Seniors). The old-
er, larger players on the Senior team would be expected to 
experience high-magnitude head impacts more frequently 
than their Junior counterparts. Because the covariates of 
age, weight, and number of practices were the first to be 
controlled for when determining the effect of the position 
and team factors, one interpretation is that this team effect 
represents a correlate for practice intensity. The effect of 
team was shown to be significantly different between the 
2 teams for the Tackling—No Blocker drill. The data sug-
gest that a team that practices in a manner that produces 
high-magnitude impacts more frequently is more likely to 
experience high-magnitude impacts in games. The prac-
tice structure did not differ between these teams, but the 
intensity of some drills did. When accounting for differ-
ences in practice length, Seniors still hit more frequently 
than did Juniors. For Seniors, the practice impact rate 
(95% CI: 3.9–5.0 impacts/hour) exceeded that of Juniors 
(95% CI: 2.5–3.6 impacts/hour). For both teams, games 
were associated with an impact rate nearly 3 times that 
observed in practice. Although Senior practice was more 
intense and produced high-magnitude impacts more fre-
quently than Junior practice, the level of intensity between 
practice and game increased markedly.
Limitations of the Study
This study had several limitations. For individual mea-
surements, the HIT system is associated with random er-
ror up to 15.7%, although the average error is only 1%.2 
Distributions of data were used for analysis throughout 
this manuscript in an effort to minimize the effects of any 
measurement error. Head impact exposure varied among 
individuals and between the teams in this study, and would 
probably vary were similar analyses to be conducted with 
other individuals and teams.5–8,10,12–17,32,33 The number of 
players on both teams in this study probably contributed to 
the play counts determined, and would vary by age group 
and team size. Practice structure and the game-to-practice 
ratio will also probably vary by age group and by league. 
Assessment of coaching style and practice intensity was 
explored across 2 unmatched age groups, rather than with 
matched age groups. By accounting for age-related factors 
in the linear model before considering the effect of prac-
tice intensity on head impact exposure, errors in inference 
were minimized. Last, this analysis was restricted to high-
magnitude impacts, which are those that are most likely 
to be visually verified. Analysis considering lower-magni-
tude impacts as well might provide different results, at the 
expense of certainty regarding the data set and conclusions 
resulting from the analysis.

Conclusions
Head impact kinematic data were collected from 2 
youth football teams composed of players 9–12 years old, 
who were assigned to a Junior or Senior team on the basis 
of age. The data were collected to determine where on the 
field high-magnitude head impacts occur, how head impact 
exposure varies according to the player position in games, 
and how representative practice is of games in regard to 
head impact rate and magnitude. Most high-magnitude 
impacts (exceeding 40g) were found to occur in the open 
field. Back players were usually involved in these open-
field impacts, whereas Line players experienced the ma-
jority of impacts at the line of scrimmage. We developed 
a framework for assessing practice impact rates relative to 
games, which can be considered a baseline. Although the 
impact rate was lower in practice than in games for both 
teams, practices occur more frequently than games and ex-
pose players to a higher number of high-magnitude head 
impacts. The 2 teams in this study structured their prac-
tices similarly, but the Senior team experienced more than 
double the number of high-magnitude practice impacts. 
Differences in age and weight between teams did not ac-
count for all differences in high-magnitude head impact 
exposure. The data suggest that coaching style or practice 
intensity may also be an important factor in high-magni-
tude head impact exposure. How practice activities are 
conducted contributes toward the overall high-magnitude 
head impact exposure for practice, not just the practice ac-
tivity itself. This analysis, augmented by the previously de-
veloped practice framework,8 may be of use to researchers 
or policy makers seeking to reduce head impact exposure 
in youth football.
