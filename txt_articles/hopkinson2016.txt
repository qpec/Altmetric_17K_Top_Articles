Abstract 
 
In vascularised organ transplants gender mismatches have higher rates of immunological rejection. 
We investigated the influence of gender incompatibility, including H-Y incompatibility, on corneal 
transplant graft rejection and failure. Patients were included who had undergone a first corneal 
transplant for keratoconus (KC), Fuchs endothelial dystrophy (FED), pseudophakic bullous 
keratopathy (PBK), infection and other indications. A Cox regression model was fitted for each 
indication to determine factors affecting graft failure and rejection at five years. The impact of gender, 
including H-Y, matching was analysed after accounting for other factors including known risk factors. 
Of 18171 patients, 4314 had undergone a transplant for FED, 4783 for KC, 3669 for PBK, 1903 for 
infection and 3502 for other disorders. H-Y mismatched (M→F) corneas were at greater risk of graft 
failure or rejection. For FED, F→F were 40% less likely to fail (p<0.0001) and 30% less likely to 
reject (p=0.01), M→M were 20% less likely to fail (p=0.04) and 30% less likely to reject (p=0.01).  
For KC, M→M matched corneas were 30% less likely to fail (p=0.05) and 20% less likely to reject

of rejection or graft failure.  
 
 
Introduction 
More than sixty years ago, Eichwald et al, noted that in a particular strain of mice, a male isogeneic 
skin graft would be chronically rejected by genotypically identical female, but not male recipients.1 In 
1977, Goulmy et al reported the immunological rejection of donor bone-marrow in a female patient 
receiving a graft from her HLA-identical brother and demonstrated that this was mediated by HLA-
restricted minor histocompatibility antigen (mHA) H-Y directed cytotoxicity.2  Scott et al 
subsequently reported that H-Y epitopes derived from intracellular proteins can be detected by CD4+ 
T-cells and presented on the cell surface via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).3  mHAs 
recognized by donor T cells are recognised to play a central role as immunologic targets of graft-
versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft versus leukaemia after allogeneic bone marrow 
transplantation.4 Males who have undergone gender-mismatched allogeneic marrow transplantation 
are at high risk for GVHD because of immune responses directed against mHAs encoded by genes on 
the Y chromosome.4  
 
In solid organ transplantation there is evidence that female recipients of male donor organs have high 
rates of acute immunological rejection in cardiac,5,6 hepatic,7 pulmonary8 and renal9 transplantation. In 
particular, in renal transplantation there is a strong association between the development of antibodies 
against H-Y antigens and renal allograft acute rejection.10 In 2006, Böhringer et al reported that H-Y 
mismatched (male-to-female) corneal transplants were associated with increased rejection episodes  
compared to H-Y matched grafts.11 Although a relatively small study, limited to 2 years and without 
stratifying for indication or graft type, which both have a major effect on graft survival they noted that 
within a mean follow up of two years, rejection free graft survival was 88% (148 patients) in the H-Y 
compatible group compared to 77% (81 patients) in the H-Y mismatched group. These reports suggest 
that gender incompatibility, may play an important role in corneal transplantation. Despite these 
findings  there is currently no policy in relation to gender matching (or at least avoidance of H-Y 
antigen mismatching) of corneas or solid organs for transplantation in the United Kingdom.  
 
In the healthy state the cornea is a privileged tissue for transplantation12 due to the absence of blood 
and lymphatic vessels, relative paucity of mature antigen presenting cells, blood-eye barrier, 
immunomodulatory factors within the eye and the good intraocular penetration of topical steroids. 
Despite this, corneal graft failure is a significant problem, with an overall 5 year actuarial graft 
survival of 70%.13 Corneal transplants fail predominantly from decompensation of the donor 
endothelium as cells of this monolayer do not divide. Donor endothelial cell injury following 
allogeneic rejection is the most common cause of endothelial failure.14 Corneal transplant survival 
rates in large cohort studies vary according to the primary corneal disorder.  The most common 
indications for corneal transplantation are diseases of the corneal endothelium, including Fuchs 
endothelial dystrophy (FED) and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (PBK) and progressive disorders 
of corneal shape such as keratoconus (KC). Patients that are affected by endothelial disease tend to be 
elderly, whereas KC tends to impact mostly young adults. Graft survival following PBK is worse than 
that following FED or KC, possibly due to inflammation and disruption of the blood-eye barrier from 
previous surgery.15 The remaining indications for corneal transplantation include corneal opacification 
following infection and a range of other less common disorders.  Inflammatory causes such as 
infection and trauma are accompanied by corneal vascularization with loss of the cornea's immune 
privilege leading to increased rejection and reduced graft survival.   
 
Formerly, the standard type of corneal transplant was a full thickness graft, penetrating keratoplasty 
(PK). In recent years advances in surgical technique have resulted in increasing proportions of 
patients receiving partial thickness (lamellar) transplants according to disease indication and which 
allow selective replacement of the diseased component of the cornea. Patients with KC undergo either 
a PK or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) in which the normal endothelium is retained;

whereas those with FED or PBK undergo either a PK or and endothelial keratoplasty (EK), in which 
the diseased endothelium is selectively replaced.  A lower risk of rejection and for EK, a much faster 
visual recovery has been recognized a primary advantage of lamellar over penetrating transplants.16  
This study investigated a large national cohort of patients receiving a first corneal transplant to 
determine whether donor and recipient gender incompatibility, including phenotype grouping for H-Y 
incompatibility, influenced corneal graft rejection and failure up to five years post-transplant. 
Analysis included all possibilities of donor to recipient gender match and the potential differences 
between penetrating and lamellar transplants. 
 
Methods  
The impact of donor and recipient gender incompatibility (including H-Y mismatches) on corneal 
graft rejection and failure was investigated for cohorts that included all adult patients (≥18 years) in 
the UK who had undergone a first PK, DALK or EK between April 1999 and March 2012. Data were 
collected by NHS Blood and Transplant from the UK Ocular Tissue Transplant Audit transplant 
record form and follow-up forms at one, two and five years post-transplantation.  
Models were considered separately for the primary corneal diagnoses: KC, FED, PBK, corneal 
infection and other (including post-trauma scar and inherited dystrophies). Graft failure was defined 
as all types of failure reported on the annual follow-up forms and graft rejection was defined as any 
rejection episode (reversible or irreversible) within 5 years. Factors considered in these models were: 
whether donor HLA-matched, the central endothelial cell count of the donor cornea (2200-2400, 
>2400 cells/mm2), donor and recipient age (19-40, 41-60, 61-75 and >75 years), graft type (PK, EK or 
DALK), the perceived level of risk of transplant failure (low or high risk),  donor-to-recipient gender 
match (M→F, M→M, F→M and F→F) and the interaction between graft type and gender matching 
(M→F, M→M, F→M and F→F for PK, EK or DALK). High-risk patients were defined as those who 
had corneal vascularization, ocular surface disease or glaucoma.  
Kaplan Meier estimates were used to predict the survival function for each factor across all 
indications. Log cumulative hazard functions were used to check proportionality of hazards for all 
factors considered for all indications. This analysis showed that the effect that some factors had on the 
hazard of failure were not constant over time. A Cox regression model was fitted for each indication 
to conclude which factors affected graft failure and graft rejection at five years using forward 
selection methods. Initially, recipient and transplant factors were added to the model followed by 
donor factors and then the gender matching factor (regardless of whether it was significant or not). 
Furthermore, an interaction between transplant type and gender matching was fitted to determine if 
the significance of gender matching was specific to the type of transplant. Where the interaction with 
graft type was not found to be significant but an effect of gender matching was significant, it would 
indicate that the effect of gender matching was present across both graft types. 
The significant factors (p ≤0.05) were extended to allow the factors to vary over time such that the 
hazard ratios (HR) differed between yearly intervals. A chi-squared test was used to determine if there 
was evidence to support whether any of these factors was not constant over time. The effect of each 
factor in the models was adjusted for all other factors that were found to be significant. In relation to 
gender matching, male-to-female matched corneas were selected as the baseline level in order to 
investigate the influence of H-Y antigen incompatibility.  
 
Results 
Data from 18 171 patients in the following diagnostic categories were analysed: KC 4783, FED 4314, 
PBK 3669, infection 1903 and 3502 with other disorders. Across these indications, 1202 and 1198 
patients were excluded because of missing graft survival and rejection outcomes, respectively.The 
final models identified significant factors influencing graft outcome and investigated the effect of 
gender matching. Some factors were time-dependent and subsequently split by yearly intervals. The 
interaction between graft type and gender matching was generally modelled as a constant over time. 
 
Across all models, common significant factors were graft type, recipient age and level of risk. Where 
gender matching was found to be significant, there was evidence to suggest that H-Y mismatched 
(M→F) corneas were at greater risk of graft failure or rejection within five years. This was 
particularly apparent in FED in which 63% of the patients were female and 37% of the cohort had

undergone an EK. The impact of gender matching on 5 year graft failure for patients with FED 
without any risk adjustments, is shown in figure 1. For all types of graft, survival for H-Y 
mismatched (M→F) transplants was 74% (CI: 71-77%) in comparison to 82% (CI: 79-85%) for F→F 
matches, (p=0.0001).  When the model for FED was risk adjusted  F→F transplants were 40% less 
likely to fail (p<0·0001) and 30% less likely to undergo rejection (p=0·01) and M→M were 20% less 
likely to fail (p=0·04) and 30% less likely to reject (p=0·01), than M→F mismatches (tables 1 and 2). 
There was some evidence to suggest F→M were 20% less likely to fail (p=0·08, table 1).  
 
In patients with KC, M→M matched corneas were 30% less likely to fail (p=0·05) and 20% less 
likely to reject (p=0·01) compared to H-Y mismatched corneas (tables 1 and 2). The differences in 
outcomes between F→F and M→M matched corneas were of further interest. In comparison to 
M→M matches, F→F matched corneas were 20% (p=0·03) less likely to fail in FED, but in KC 20% 
(p=0·05) more likely to undergo rejection.   
 
The significance of gender matching was specific to certain transplant types for some high rejection 
risk indications (PBK and corneal infections). Patients with an infection who received a F→F PK 
transplant were 30% less likely to fail than H-Y mismatched PK (p=0·01, Table 1). In addition, there 
was some evidence to suggest that F→M gender mismatched corneas were also 20% less likely to fail 
in PK transplants (p=0·05, Table 1). For patients with other corneal disorders who had undergone a 
F→F, PK transplant were 30% less likely to reject compared to M→F (p=0·01, Table 2). The risk-
adjusted effect of gender matching for the diagnostic indications  which were found to be significant 
for graft failure and graft rejection are shown in figures 2 and 3, respectively.  
 
For patients with PBK, the effect of graft type was time-dependent and as such the significant 
interaction with gender matching was examined in year intervals post-transplant (Supplementary 
Table).  Significant results in DALK and EK matched transplants were less conclusive due to the 
relatively smaller number of transplants undertaken. This was also the case for patients who had 
undergone an EK for PBK patients in which there were insufficient evidence to obtain estimates for 
hazard ratios beyond 2 years.   
 
Discussion 
There are many well described donor and recipient factors in corneal transplantation affecting graft 
survival and rejection17-19 several of which, were also evident in this study.  This, however, is the first 
large population study demonstrating a clinically important benefit of gender matching, in particular 
mHAg H-Y compatibility or indeed the compatibility of any minor histocompatibility tissue antigen 
in transplantation.  
 
Previous studies in rodent models have highlighted the importance of minor H antigens, which can be 
recognized by the host immune system and have the potential to elicit immune reactions despite 
optimal matching of the MHC after keratoplasty.20-24  That this should be found in corneal 
transplantation is plausible, as recognition of minor antigens is known to be by the indirect pathway 
of allorecognition, which  following corneal transplantation occurs predominantly by the indirect 
pathway. 25 Böhringer et al reported that H-Y mismatched grafts and high risk patients had reduced 
rejection free survivals at 2 years. 11 In comparison we found that for patients with FED, the graft 
survival was lower for H-Y mismatched grafts. They did not consider the effect of diagnosis 
(indication) or if H-Y mismatch differed across graft type; both of which have a major influence on 
graft survival. Other previous clinical studies into the effect of gender differences and H-Y 
incompatibility on graft rejection and survival have been limited by, sample size, stratification (HLA 
matching, indication and risk) and follow-up.  No consistent significant H-Y or gender effect has been 
reported, other than that of Volker-Dieben et al, who noted that at 1yr better graft survival of corneas 
from female donors in female than in male recipients.26-29 We therefore, explored all possible donor-
recipient gender combinations to distinguish the risks comparable to M→F mismatched corneas. This 
included the most common indications across transplant types, recognising the complexities of the 
differing procedures and corneal disorders.  This allowed an examination of the differential benefits 
of gender matching in corneal transplantation.

We found that corneas from phenotypically H-Y donor recipient mismatches  were at significantly 
greater risk of graft failure or rejection within five years in a number of corneal disorders. The effect 
of gender matching, however, was particularly evident amongst patients with FED and this effect was 
present across both types of graft, PK and EK.  Although less pronounced, the effect was also present 
in patients with KC, for example,  grafts in M→M donor to recipient matches, were 20% less likely to 
reject and 30% less likely to fail compared to H-Y mismatches. The reduction in effect may possibly 
reflect a larger male recipient cohort as only 30% of the patients with KC were female.  Potential 
variation in the effect of H-Y antigen mismatching could be associated with previous transfusions or 
pregnancies. This may possibly have contributed to the effect of gender matching in older women 
with FED as opposed to younger women with KC.   
 
The differential effect of gender matching in lamellar keratoplasty, may be masked by different level 
of risk of graft failure and rejection in each disorder, shorter follow-up, centre effect 30 and by the 
smaller numbers of transplants compared to PK. Further research in EK and DALK would be of 
particular interest but would depend on larger numbers in each cohort. 
The effect of gender mismatches, however, although significant, was less pronounced in higher risk or 
inflammatory conditions. For example, compared to M→F mismatches, patients with F→F matches 
were 30% less likely to fail if they had undergone a transplant for infection and 30% less likely to 
reject for other indications.  It is probable that the presence of other possible confounding factors in 
these latter indications, such as chronic inflammation in the recipient eye obscure the role of H-Y 
minor histocompatibility antigens in graft rejection and failure.  For high risk patients there may be a 
beneficial effect of  patients HLA-A, -B nor HLA-DR or ABO blood group matching antigen 
matching in reducing corneal graft failure.31-32  We were not able to investigate whether there was an 
interaction between gender match and HLA matching as the percentage of non-HLA matched grafts 
ranged from 93-99% across indications.  
 
In addition to the phenotypic H-Y incompatibility effect, there was an effect of donor-to-recipient 
gender differences  evident by the differences in outcomes between F→F and M→M matched corneas 
for KC and FED.   This is difficult to explain on the basis of sex dimorphism in the systemic immune 
response particularly as compared to males, females produce more vigorous cellular and humoral 
immune reactions.33  It is possible that differences in sex steroids such as androgens, estrogens and 
progestins, may contribute to this effect as they have been reported to account for many of the gender-
related differences in the eye. 34  Sex steroid receptor mRNAs exist in a variety of ocular tissues 
including the cornea and these sites may represent target organs for androgens, estrogens and or 
progestins.35 Similarly, androgen binding sites have been described in the bovine corneal epithelium 36 
and it has been suggested that they play a role in wound healing, 37,38 and in stimulating corneal 
epithelial cell mitosis.39 Consequently, it is quite possible that sex steroid hormone levels in ocular 
tissues may increase or decrease in response to changes in the sex hormone environment.40,41  In 
vascularised organ transplants there is evidence that female recipients of male organs have higher 
rates of acute immunological rejection in cardiac,5,6 hepatic,7 pulmonary,8 and renal9 transplantation.  
This gender effect may be overshadowed by the effect of HLA matching in organ transplantation as 
the above reports5-10 have not led to a policy on avoidance of H-Y incompatibility or gender 
mismatching in donor organ allocation. This would not be the case in corneal transplantation, as 
reported benefits of HLA matching in corneal transplantation are equivocal and the role of HLA 
matching remains unclear.42  
 
In conclusion this study demonstrates overall, that gender matching was significantly associated with 
reduced graft failure and rejection in patients KC and FED.  For patients with FED, this effect was 
present across both types of graft, EK and PK. Most notably in FED, F→F transplants were 40% less 
likely to fail and 30% less likely to undergo rejection compared to M→F transplants. The effect of 
gender matching was less pronounced in high risk conditions. As originally suggested by Böhringer et 
al schemes to avoid H-Y incompatibility in corneal transplantation would be free of additional costs 
from antigen typing. Corneas from male donors could be preferentially allocated to male recipients

and those from female donors to female or male recipients. This would straightforward to put in place 
without delay in donor tissue allocation to patients or any significant added cost.
