IMPORTANCE Severe obesity affects 4% to 6% of US youth and is increasing in prevalence.
Bariatric surgery for the treatment of adolescents with severe obesity is becoming more
common, but data on cost-effectiveness are limited.
OBJECTIVE To assess the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for adolescents with obesity
using recently published results from the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery
study.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A state-transition model was constructed to compare 2
strategies: no surgery and bariatric surgery. In the no surgery strategy, patients remained at
their initial body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared) over time. In the bariatric surgery strategy, patients were subjected to risks of
perioperative mortality and complications as well as initial morbidity but also experienced
longer-term quality-of-life improvements associated with weight loss. Cohort demographic
information—of the 228 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 17 (1.6) years, the mean
(range) body mass index was 53 (34-88), and 171 (75.0%) were female—surgery-related
outcomes, and base case time horizon (3 years) were based on data from the
Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study. One-way and probabilistic
sensitivity analyses were performed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs (in US
dollars adjusted to 2015-year values using the Consumer Price Index), and incremental
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY was
used to assess cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS After 3 years, surgery led to a gain of 0.199 QALYs compared with no surgery at an
incremental cost of $30 747, yielding an unfavorable ICER of $154 684 per QALY. When the
clinical study results were extrapolated to 4 years, the ICER decreased to $114 078 per QALY
and became cost-effective by 5 years with an ICER of $91 032 per QALY. Outcomes were
robust in most 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bariatric surgery incurs substantial initial cost and morbidity.
We found that surgery could be a cost-effective treatment for adolescents with severe
obesity if assessed over a time horizon of 5 years. Our study underscores the need for
long-term clinical trials in adolescents with at least 5 years of follow-up data that capture
financial and quality-of-life end points.

O
verweight and obesity affect more than one-third of
children and adolescents in the United States.1 Se-
vere obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI, cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared) of 35 or greater or 120% of the 95th percentile or
greater (whichever is lower), affects 4% to 6% of US youth and
isgrowingmoreprevalent.2Behavioralinterventionisthefirst-
linetreatmentforadolescentswithsevereobesity,butthistype
of intervention rarely leads to meaningful long-term weight
loss in this population.2 One recent study3 indicated that be-
havioral treatment had no effect whatsoever on adolescents
with severe obesity when assessed 1, 2, and 3 years after the
intervention. While other studies have found that behavioral
therapy results in less than 3% total body weight loss in
adolescents with obesity,4,5 this small effect usually does not
translateintomeaningfulchangeforindividualswithveryhigh
baseline BMIs.
Bariatric surgery is increasingly being considered as an
option for adolescents who have not achieved adequate
weight loss through nonsurgical therapy. The Teen-
Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS)
study, which prospectively observed 242 adolescents under-
going weight-loss surgery, found that total body weight
decreased by 27% at 3 years after surgery.6 In addition to
enabling weight loss, surgery also helped patients avoid
obesity-related comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes,
renal damage, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.7
Bariatric surgery is performed in approximately 1000
adolescents each year, and its use in US youth is on the
rise.8,9 Nevertheless, bariatric procedures for adolescents
remain highly controversial. Possible complications include
anastomotic leak, sepsis, and bleeding,10 although their
occurrence is rare.11 In a 2007 survey, nearly half of primary
care physicians indicated that they would not refer adoles-
cents for bariatric surgery.12 However, as surgery continues
to develop a track record of efficacy and safety in the adoles-
cent population, it has the potential to become a less contro-
versial and more common therapeutic option. In this setting
of increasing use with high initial morbidity and cost, it is
important to assess the cost-effectiveness of surgical treat-
ment to inform health care decision making. The Teen-LABS
study consortium recently released 3-year results,6 which
have enabled us to conduct a reliable cost-effectiveness
analysis of bariatric surgery in adolescents.
Methods
Model Overview
We developed a cohort state-transition model, also known as
a Markov model, using TreeAge Pro 2015 (TreeAge) to assess
the cost-effectiveness of 2 strategies: no surgery and bariat-
ric surgery (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). TreeAge Pro is a
software platform that is used to build and analyze state-
transition models, which are useful for assessing the effect
of treatments including their cost-effectiveness. The mean
(SD) age of the 228 patients from the Teen-LABS study was
17 (1.6) years, the mean (range) initial BMI was 53 (34-88),
and 171 (75.0%) were female. Cohort demographic informa-
tion and the time horizon (3 years) were based on data from
the Teen-LABS study.6 After the initial analysis, the model
was run beyond 3 years. The model cycle length, or time
between state transitions, was 1 month. Because this was a
mathematical analysis and did not include any individual-
level patient data, the Massachusetts General Hospital Insti-
tutional Review Board does not require approval and
informed consent in this context.
Competing Strategies for Weight Management
Inthenosurgerystrategy,patientsremainedattheirinitialBMI

tervention on the Teen-LABS study, where patients received
either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (161 [70.6%]) or sleeve gastrec-
tomy (67 [29.4%]).6 These patients faced a small risk of 30-day

Key Points
Question Is bariatric surgery a cost-effective treatment for
adolescents with severe obesity?
Findings In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a mathematical state
transition model was used to determine that bariatric surgery has
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $154 684 per
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) when assessed over 3 years,
$114 078 per QALY over 4 years, and $91 032 per QALY over 5
years. Thus, bariatric surgery is cost-effective at 5 years using a
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY.
Meaning This study underscores the need for long-term clinical
trials in adolescents with at least 5 years of follow-up data that
capture financial and quality-of-life end points.

Surgical patients received an initial quality-of-life decre-
ment associated with the operation, which was applied for 6
weeks.13,21,22 Quality-of-life effects of complications were
also incorporated; the quality-of-life decrement was applied
for 4 weeks for minor complications and 6 weeks for major
complications.13,22,23 We applied a quality-of-life improve-
ment of 0.0056 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per BMI
unit decrease.24,25 Weight-loss data were based on data from
the Teen-LABS study until year 3,6 after which weight-loss
data were derived from results from the Swedish Obese Sub-
jects study (eTables 1 and 2 in the Supplement).26 Nonsurgi-
cal patients experienced no change in weight or quality of
life in our analysis.13,14
Outcomes
Study end points included QALYs, total costs, and incremen-
tal cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A willingness-to-pay
threshold of $100 000 per QALY was used to determine
cost-effectiveness.27 To assess the effect of model input un-
certainty on cost-effectiveness results, 1-way sensitivity analy-
ses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
Results
In the base case analysis, QALYs accumulated over 3 years for
the no surgery and bariatric surgery strategies were 2.057 and
2.256,respectively(Table2).Thebariatricsurgerystrategycost
$30 747 more than the no surgery strategy over this time ho-
rizon. The ICER of bariatric surgery vs no surgery was $154 684
perQALY;usingawillingness-to-paythresholdof$100 000per
QALY, bariatric surgery was not cost-effective (Figure 1). When
the time horizon was extended to 4 years, the ICER of bariat-
ric surgery vs no surgery decreased to $114 078 per QALY. Over
a 5-year time horizon, this ICER further decreased to $91 032
per QALY, suggesting that bariatric surgery was cost-effective
if assessed over a 5-year follow-up.
We performed 1-way sensitivity analyses over 3-, 4-, and
5-year time horizons (Figure 2; eFigures 2 and 3 in the Supple-
ment). Bariatric surgery was never cost-effective over a 3-year
time horizon; over a 4-year time horizon, bariatric surgery was
cost-effective only if the cost of gastric bypass was set at its
minimum value. Over a 5-year duration, bariatric surgery re-
mained cost-effective in most sensitivity analyses. However,
when the model was run using the maximum cost of gastric

Probabilistic sensitivity was performed on the model over
varied time horizons. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of
$100 000 per QALY, bariatric surgery was cost-effective with
a probability of 0%, 17%, and 78% over 3, 4, and 5 years, re-

the probability of late complications. Our results underscore
the need for long-term clinical trials in adolescents with at
least 5 years of follow-up data that capture financial, quality-
of-life, and complication end points.
While several analyses have examined the cost-effective-
nessofbariatricsurgeryinadults,13,24,28-30similarstudiesinchil-
dren and adolescents are comparatively lacking, perhaps be-
cause of a dearth of prospective studies with more than 1 year
of follow-up data.17 A strength of our analysis stems from the
high-quality and relatively long-term data that we incorpo-
rated from a recently published Teen-LABS study,11 which pro-
vided3years’worthofcomprehensivedataonweightloss,com-
plication rates, and quality of life. The Teen-LABS study also
included 228 participants who underwent either laparoscopic
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (161) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrec-
tomy(67).6Toourknowledge,besidesouranalysis,1otherstudy
has assessed the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in
adolescents,17anditusedclinicaldatafromonly11patientswho
all received gastric bypass—a procedure that is becoming less
commonly used.18,31
Other analyses focused on adults have long indicated the
favorable cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery as a treat-
ment for obesity, including persons with mild, moderate, or
severe obesity. Our analysis focused only on adolescents with
severe obesity because of a lack of data supporting efficacy or
safety of operation in other classes of obesity for adolescents.
Several cost-effectiveness analyses have also assessed the ad-
ditional benefits that bariatric surgery confers to adults with
obesity-related comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes.24,28
Based on the 3-year results from the Teen-LABS study, bariat-
ric surgery may lead to remission of obesity-associated comor-
bidities at higher rates in adolescents than in adults. In our
analysis, we did not explicitly model the benefit of comorbid-
ity improvement after bariatric surgery, such as diabetes and
hypertension, which resolved in 95% and 80% of patients, re-
spectively, in the Teen-LABS study.6 However, we accounted
for this effect by incorporating BMI-specific mortality, which
implicitly reflects the health benefits of comorbidity resolu-
tion. Additionally, our decision not to separately model each
obesity-related comorbidity is conservative; even without ac-
counting for each obesity-related condition, bariatric surgery
is cost-effective over a relatively short time horizon.
Our model shows that bariatric surgery can become cost-
effective over a relatively short time horizon, even without in-
corporating the potential cost savings that may follow bariatric
surgerybecauseofdecreasedhealthcareresourceuse.Wechose
to exclude such cost savings from our model because the effect
of bariatric surgery on expenditures remains an issue of signifi-
cant debate, and health care costs do not appear to decrease in
the 3 to 6 years immediately following bariatric surgery, even
amongpatientswithdiabetes.32-34Ourrationaleisalsosupported
bytheSwedishObeseSubjectsstudy,whichfoundthatsurgically
treated patients incurred more costs than nonsurgical patients
in the first 6 years after the operation.35
Like most modeling analyses, ours has limitations. First,
we made the simplifying assumption that BMI would remain
stable in nonsurgical patients. Thus, our model did not re-
flect the possibility of obesity severity increasing with age.3 If
we modeled any potential weight gain in the nonsurgical
patients, then bariatric surgery would have become cost-
effective over an even shorter time horizon than we deter-
mined.Anotherlimitationtoourstudyisthatwedidnotmodel
gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy separately. It is likely
thatweightloss,comorbidityresolution,andcomplicationrisk
differ according to the type of procedure. However, we be-
lieve that there are currently insufficient data to allow a mean-
ingfulcost-effectivenesscomparisonoftheseproceduresinthe
adolescent population.
Conclusions
At present, bariatric surgery is performed in approximately
1000 adolescents per year. Increasing access to bariatric sur-
gery in adolescents, even by a factor of 4, would hardly affect
obesity prevalence on a population level.36 For this reason, ex-
perts in childhood and adolescent obesity focus primarily
on public health interventions, such as taxes on sugar-
sweetened beverages, calorie labeling on restaurant menus,
and nutrition standards for food in schools. From an

individual-patient perspective, though, bariatric surgery can
result in life-altering weight loss, which not only leads to the
resolution and prevention of disease but also allows patients
to avoid the stigma, bullying, and isolation that often accom-
pany severe obesity.37 As evidence supporting the safety and
efficacy of bariatric surgery continues to accrue for the ado-
lescent population, it will likely become a more accepted and
commonlyusedtherapeuticoption.Ouranalysisindicatesthat
it can also be cost-effective when assessed over a relatively
short time horizon. Longer-term studies that track quality of
life, weight loss, comorbidity resolution, and health care costs
are needed to confirm our findings.
