Abstract
Study Objectives: African Americans have been under-represented in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) research. This study 
determined the prevalence and correlates of OSA overall and by sex among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Sleep Study.
Methods: Participants (N = 852) underwent a type 3 in-home sleep apnea study, 7 day wrist actigraphy and completed standardized 
measurements and questionnaires. OSA was defined as an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) of ≥15, where hypopneas were defined 
as ≥ 4% associated desaturation. Physician diagnosis of OSA was self-reported. Logistic regression models were fit to determine 
the associations of demographics, socioeconomic status, sleep symptoms, actigraphy-based sleep, body mass index (BMI), and 
comorbidities with OSA.
Results: Average age was 63.1 (standard deviation = 10.7), 66% were female, and mean BMI was 32.0 (6.9) kg/m2. Approximately 
24% had an AHI ≥ 15; of those, 5% had a physician diagnosis of OSA. Prevalence of OSA increased across BMI categories, but not 
age groups. Men had a 12% higher prevalence of OSA compared with women, p < 0.01. Older age, male sex, higher BMI, larger neck 
circumference, and report of habitual snoring were independently associated with higher odds of OSA, all p < 0.05. Associations 
between sleep symptoms and OSA were similar for men and women. Sleepiness and waist circumference were not associated with 
OSA.
Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of objectively measured but undiagnosed OSA in this sample of African Americans. 
Snoring, BMI, and neck circumference were important markers of OSA for men and women. Our results suggest that screening tools 
that incorporate information on sleepiness and waist circumference may be suboptimal in this population.

Statement of Significance
In this population of African Americans living in the southern United States, we found a high prevalence of moderate or 
severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (24%), which was mainly undiagnosed (95%). Men had a higher prevalence of OSA com-
pared with women. The strongest predictor of OSA was male sex. Snoring, body mass index and neck circumference were 
important markers of OSA for both men and women. Our results suggest that screening tools that incorporate information on 
neck rather than waist circumference and snoring but more so than sleepiness may perform better in some African American 
populations. Future screening procedures may need to more directly assess OSA (e.g. using oximetry or other objective test-
ing) in populations with high rates of obesity, including under-represented minority groups.

 Introduction
Sleep apnea is highly prevalent, estimated to affect 26% of adults, 
with moderate or severe sleep apnea affecting approximately 
10% of adults [1, 2]. Moreover, an estimated 80 to 90% of indi-
viduals with sleep apnea are undiagnosed [2–9]. Undiagnosed 
and untreated sleep apnea is associated with daytime sleepi-
ness, decreased daily functioning, cognitive deficits, hyperten-
sion, and cardiovascular disease [10–12].
Sleep disorders are prevalent among minority populations 
 
[3, 13]. African Americans in particular have a higher prevalence 
of sleep apnea syndrome (apnea–hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 5 plus 
sleepiness), daytime sleepiness, poor sleep quality, and more 
severe sleep apnea compared with non-Hispanic Whites [3, 14]. 
Also, findings from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis 
(MESA) demonstrated that only 16.2% of African Americans 
from 6 US cities who had polysomnography-defined moderate 
or severe sleep apnea reported a physician diagnosis [3]. The 
prior study had a limited sample of African Americans and did 
not explore the factors related to sleep apnea in that population. 
It is possible that factors affecting screening or diagnosis are dif-
ferent and therefore should be explored.
Epidemiological studies have identified demographic (e.g. 
male sex and older age), comorbidities (e.g., obesity and hyper-
tension), and sleep symptoms (e.g. snoring and sleepiness), as 
risk factors and correlates of increased obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) prevalence [2, 7]. These prior studies consisted of predomi-
nately non-Hispanic white individuals. Predictors of OSA may be 
different among African Americans than non-Hispanic whites 
due to differences in body fat distribution and the higher preva-
lence of comorbidities [15–17] and potentially to differences in 
perception of symptoms. Since central fat distribution predicts 
OSA, differences in body fat distribution may influence associa-
tions of body mass index (BMI) and OSA [15]. Therefore, BMI may 
be a poor surrogate for central fat distribution. To understand 
potential risk factors for OSA among African Americans, it is 
important to evaluate established risk factors and correlates of 
sleep apnea (e.g. demographics, sleep habits, and comorbidities) 
as well as indices obtained from actigraphy, a tool increasingly 
used in population health to characterize sleep patterns.
There are also important sex differences in the prevalence 
of OSA. For instance, research among non-Hispanic whites has 
shown that men are more likely to have OSA than women, due 
to differences in body fat distribution, upper airway anatomy, 
breathing control, hormones, aging, and other differences in 
physiology [18]. Similarly, in a US Hispanic/Latino population, 
men compared with women had a two- to three-fold higher 
prevalence of OSA [19]. Because of the high prevalence of obe-
sity among African American women, sex differences in the 
prevalence of OSA may be mitigated. Also, a higher percentage 
of women may have under-diagnosed sleep disorders than men 
[8], which may influence sex differences in OSA.
The goal of this paper was to describe the prevalence and 
correlates of OSA by sex among African Americans in the 
Jackson Heart Sleep Study (JHSS) and estimate the propor-
tion of undiagnosed cases. We hypothesized the following: (1) 
there would be a high prevalence of OSA with few participants 
reporting a physician-diagnosis; (2) traditional OSA risk factors 
as well as sleep symptoms and sleep patterns would be associ-
ated with OSA; and (3) OSA severity would be similar between 
women and men.
Methods
Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a longitudinal study of 5306 
African American adults aged 21 to 95 at baseline from three 
counties (Hinds, Madison, and Rankin) that comprise the 
Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area. JHS was designed to 
prospectively study the etiology of cardiovascular disease 
among African Americans. Participants were recruited from the 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (30%), family mem-
bers of participants (28%), random selection (17%), and com-
munity volunteers (25%) between September 2000 and March 
2004 and three core examinations were conducted. The details 
of the JHS have been published [20]. The current analyses uti-
lize data from the JHSS (see below). Institutional Review Board 
approval was obtained from the University of Mississippi and 
Partners Research Committee and written informed consent 
was obtained from all participants.
Between 2012 and 2016, 913 participants were enrolled in 
the JHSS. Eligible participants were those who participated in 
the third JHS follow-up exam (N = 3609) or who had participated 
in other follow-up ancillary studies. We attempted to contact 
potential participants by phone and/or mail (N = 3015) with an 
invitation to participate. Individuals who reported regular use of 
continuous positive airway pressure (N = 70) or were first-degree 
relatives of a consenting participant (N = 10) were not eligible 
for the study. Participants attended a clinic visit and underwent 
in-home sleep apnea testing, 1 week wrist actigraphy, fasting 
venipuncture, anthropometry, blood pressure, and other vascu-
lar studies, and completed interviewer administered sleep and 
health questionnaires. The analysis was restricted to 852 par-
ticipants with valid sleep apnea test data (≥3 hr of data from the 
oximeter, nasal pressure, and one or more respiratory band), see 
Supplementary Figure S1 for a consort flow diagram.
Sleep measures
OSA was assessed with a validated type 3 home sleep apnea device 
(Embletta-Gold device; Embla, Broomfield, CO) [21, 22], record-
ing nasal pressure (measuring airflow); thoracic and abdominal 
inductance plethysmography; finger pulse oximetry; body posi-
tion; and ECG. The AHI was derived as the sum of all apneas plus 
hypopneas associated with ≥3% (AHI3P) or 4% (AHI4P) oxygen 
desaturation divided by the estimated sleep time, edited to exclude 
artifact and likely wake times [23]. Sleep time was estimated using 
a previously reported method [23]. Sleep onset was identified based 
on reduction of movement artifact, heart rate, and assumption 
of rhythmic breathing. Sleep offset was identified by the appear-
ance of sustained movement activity and/or increased heart rate. 
Obstructive apneas were identified when the amplitude (peak to 
trough) of the nasal pressure signal was flat or nearly flat for >10 s. 
Hypopneas were identified if a ≥30% reduction of amplitude was 
visualized in the nasal pressure signal or, if unclear, in the respira-
tory inductance bands for ≥10 s. The desaturation associated with 
respiratory events was based on the nadir desaturation after the 
termination of the event (20 to 45 s). The end of events was identi-
fied at the beginning of a breath that exceeded the amplitude for 
breaths qualifying as hypopneas.
OSA severity was characterized by the following standard 
AHI categories: <5 (unaffected); ≥5 (mild), ≥15 to 30 (moderate), 
and ≥30 (severe). For the current study, we further categorized 
“moderate or severe” OSA as AHI ≥15, with no upper limit.

 Sleep duration and efficiency were obtained from 7 day 
wrist actigraphy. Participants wore a GT3X+ Activity Monitor on 
the nondominant wrist for 7 consecutive days and completed 
a sleep diary [24]. Actigraphic data during 60 s epochs were 
scored as sleep or wake by ActiLife version 6.13 analysis soft-
ware (ActiGraph Corp, Pensicola, FL) using the validated algo-
rithm (Cole-Kripke) [25]. From valid nocturnal actigraphy data, 
we computed the average values for the following: total sleep 
duration and sleep efficiency (total sleep time from lights off to 
lights on; continuously and dichotomized at 85%). There were 
811 participants with valid actigraphy measures.
From the sleep questionnaire, we assessed daytime sleepi-
ness (Epworth Sleepiness Score [ESS]), insomnia symptoms 
(Women’s Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale [WHIIRS]), 
habitual snoring, and self-reported diagnosis of sleep apnea. 
Sleepiness was defined by an ESS of >10 [26]. Insomnia was iden-
tified as a WHIIRS of ≥10 [27]. Habitual snoring was defined as 
self-reported snoring at least 3 times a week.
Demographics
Participants’ age (date of birth) and sex (male or female) were 
self-reported. Age was categorized as <50, 50–59, 60–69, and 
≥70 years.
Socioeconomic status
Education was selected from four categories (less than high 
school, high school or GED, some college, or college degree). Self-
reported family income was selected from 15 categories and a 
continuous measure was derived using midpoints. Employment 
status was self-reported as employed or not employed.
Anthropometry
Height, weight, waist, and neck circumference were measured 
by trained staff following a standardized protocol. BMI was cal-
culated in kg/m2 using measurements of weight and height. BMI 
was categorized as underweight/normal weight (<25 kg/m2), 
overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2), obese (30–39.9 kg/m2), and morbidly 
obese (≥40 kg/m2).
Comorbidities
Seated blood pressure measurements were obtained using an 
Omron HEM907XL blood pressure monitor after 5 min of rest. 
Three seated blood pressure readings were taken 1 min apart 
and the last two were averaged. Hypertension was defined as 
a systolic blood pressure of ≥130 mmHg or a diastolic blood 
pressure of ≥80 mmHg, use of antihypertensive medications 
(self-report or identified from a medication inventory), or self-
reported history of hypertension [28]. Diabetes was defined as 
fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, use of antidiabetic medication, or 
self-reported diabetes diagnosis [29].
Statistical analyses
Means with standard deviations and proportions were calcu-
lated to describe the marginal and sex-specific distribution of 
covariates and OSA measures. We reported medians with inter-
quartile ranges for family income, AHI, and WHIIRS, which had 
skewed distributions. Sex differences in OSA prevalence were 
determined by the chi-square test. The primary OSA analytic 
measure was AHI4P, required 4% or greater desaturations to 
accompany hypopneas [30]; results with AHI3P (requiring 3% or 
greater desaturations to define hypopneas) were also examined 
(corresponding tables are shown in Supplementary Material).
A population-based estimate of OSA prevalence among 
African Americans age of 50–80 years in the United States (US) 
was estimated using data from the JHSS and national survey 
data. We estimated the prevalence of African Americans in the 
US in age, sex, and BMI-specific strata using data from the US 
census and from combined data from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2012, 2013–2014, 
and 2015–2016. We used the NHANES sampling weights and 
included African American participants who were 50–80 years of 
age. We then estimated the population-based prevalence of OSA 
by applying JHSS OSA prevalence rates to NHANES age, sex, and 
BMI distributions. We used a bootstrap procedure to obtain the 
95% confidence intervals for the OSA prevalence estimates [2].
Marginal and sex-specific prevalence of OSA by age group and 
BMI category was generated separately. We used linear regression 
models to test the significance of the trend in the prevalence of 
OSA across age groups or BMI categories among the total sample 
and the significance of sex interactions with age groups or BMI 
categories, analyzed as ordinal variables. We calculated Spearman 
correlation coefficients to describe the associations of covariates 
and OSA (AHI ≥ 15) among the overall and sex-specific strata.
Among the analytic sample, there was at most 3% missing 
for each covariate, except for income, which had 15% missing 
data. To address the missingness in the dataset, we imputed 10 
complete datasets using the MICE package in R (version 3.4.0). 
Each dataset was imputed with 20 iterations. We confirmed 
convergence of the MICE imputation using trace plots. Logistic 
regression models were fit based on 10 imputed datasets to esti-
mate crude odds ratios of OSA associated with each covariate 
and the respective 95% confidence interval. Age, BMI, waist, and 
neck circumference were standardized. The odds ratios were 
further adjusted for age, sex, and BMI in the multivariate logistic 
regression analyses. We also conducted sex-stratified analyses 
adjusted for age and BMI.
Statistical significance was determined as p ≤ 0.05. Except 
for imputation, all analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Participants in JHSS were comparable to those in Exam 3 in terms 
of distributions of age, sex, BMI, diabetes, and self-reported 
sleep duration. However, compared with Exam 3 participants 
not enrolled in JHSS, participants in JHSS (N = 913) had a higher 
proportion with a college degree and with hypertension, p < 0.01 
(Supplementary Table S1).
The study sample had a mean age of 63.1 years (standard 
deviation [SD]: 10.7) and was mostly female (66.0%) and college 
educated (53.8%) (Table 1). Compared with men, women were 
slightly older, less likely to be employed, had a lower median 
household income, had a higher BMI, a higher prevalence of 
hypertension, and reported a higher frequency of symptoms

 of insomnia (Table 1). Daytime sleepiness and habitual snoring 
were reported by 20.5 and 37.4% of participants, respectively. 
The average sleep duration was 6.7 hr (SD: 1.1) and 61.5% had a 
short sleep duration of <7 hr. Women had a longer sleep dura-
tion compared with men, p = 0.012. Approximately 29.3% had a 
sleep efficiency of <85%.
Distribution and sex, age, and BMI-related 
prevalence of OSA
The prevalence of moderate or more severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15) was 
23.6% based on the AHI4P. Prevalence of OSA syndrome, defined 
by an AHI of >5 and sleepiness (ESS ≥ 10), was 12.1%. Overall, 
the prevalence of OSA appeared to increase from 17.7% for those 
less than 50 years to 22.9% for those 50–59, then plateaued at 
24.8% for those 60–69 years and older than 70 years old (Figure 1), 
but the trend was not statistically significant (ptrend = 0.23). The 
prevalence of OSA increased steeply across BMI categories from 
under/normal weight to morbidly obese, ptrend < 0.01 (Figure 2). 
Women had a lower median AHI4P compared with men, p < 0.001 
(Table 1). Similarly, men had an approximately 11.8% higher prev-
alence of moderate or more severe OSA compared with women, 
p < 0.001. There were no sex differences in OSA prevalence across 
age groups (pinteraction = 0.34) or BMI categories (pinteraction = 0.40).
Supplementary Table S2 shows the OSA prevalence esti-
mates that were determined by extrapolating JHSS age, sex, and 
BMI-specific OSA estimates to US national census and epide-
miological data. The population-based OSA prevalence (AHI4P ≥ 
15) was 20.4% (17.3, 23.4).
Correlates of OSA
In unadjusted models, male sex, higher BMI, larger waist and 
neck circumferences, hypertension, habitual snoring, and lower 
sleep efficiency were associated with higher odds of OSA, p < 0.05 
(Table 2). After adjustment for age and BMI, male sex remained

 associated with higher odds of OSA, an odds ratio (OR) of 2.67 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.87, 3.80). In separate adjusted 
models, both BMI and neck circumference, but not waist circum-
ference, were associated with OSA, OR of 2.06 (1.71, 2.47) and 
1.55 (1.18, 2.05) per SD change in BMI and neck circumference, 
respectively. Hypertension, but not diabetes was associated 
with OSA in the unadjusted analysis; however, this association 
attenuated and was no longer significant after adjustments. Of 
the data on sleep symptoms and sleep patterns, habitual snor-
ing but not excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia symptoms 
nor actigraphy-based sleep (duration, efficiency) was associated 
with OSA after adjusting for covariates, OR of 1.94 (1.37, 2.75).
Sex-stratified results are shown given the reported sex dif-
ferences for OSA prevalence and risk factors in other popula-
tions (Table 2) [18]. There was an adjusted significant interaction 
between sex and employment, pinteraction = 0.02. The stratified 
analysis showed that the age- and BMI-adjusted odds of OSA 
tended to be lower for employed men, OR of 0.54 (0.28, 1.01) but 
higher for employed women, OR of 1.64 (0.96, 2.79). Sex-stratified 
associations with AHI3P are shown in Supplementary Table S3.
Undiagnosed OSA
Of the 23.6% of the study sample with OSA (AHI ≥ 15), only 5% 
reported a physician diagnosis of OSA; in other words, 95% of 
individuals with OSA were undiagnosed. Among those with an 
AHI4P > 15, the prevalence of a physician diagnosis was 4.5 and 
5.8% among those with ESS > 10 vs. ≤10.
Prevalence using the AHI3P and an AHI ≥ 5
Prevalence of sleep apnea using an AHI ≥ 5 and AHI3P is shown 
in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5. As expected, the AHI3P 
and AHI4P were highly correlated, r = 0.72 (Supplementary 
Table S6) and had a κ coefficient of 0.69. The prevalence of mod-
erate or more severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15) using the AHI3P was 37.2% 
(Figure 3). Of these, only 4% reported a physician diagnosis of 
OSA. Standardized estimates of prevalence of OSA based on 
an AHI4P ≥ 5 or AHI3P ≥ 15 are also shown in Supplementary 
Table S2. Associations with risk factors with AHI3P are shown in 
Supplementary Table S3.
Discussion
In this population of African Americans in the JHSS, we found a 
high prevalence of moderate or severe OSA, ranging from 23.6 to 
37.2%, depending on the desaturation threshold used to define 
hypopneas. Furthermore, only 4%–5% with clinically significant 
levels of OSA reported a physician diagnosis of OSA. Consistent 
with the literature, OSA was more prevalent in men than women, 
with a 12%–15% higher prevalence in men, depending on the 
desaturation threshold used to define AHI. Although the trend 
test across ordinal age groups did not reveal a significant asso-
ciation between the prevalence of OSA and age groups, when 
age was analyzed as a continuous variable in a model adjusting 
for sex and BMI, older age was associated with higher odds of 
OSA. We observed a strong association of increasing BMI with 
OSA in both men and women. After adjusting for BMI, there was

 a significant association between neck, but not waist circumfer-
ence in the entire sample and in men and women. Snoring, but 
not sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, or actigraphy measures of 
sleep duration or efficiency, was associated with OSA in both 
men and women.
The JHSS is a large study of African Americans aimed to 
understand sleep patterns and the role of sleep disorders in the 
health of this population. Insufficient sleep and sleep difficulties 
were common among our population. Unrecognized OSA was 
extremely prevalent, with 95% of participants with an AHI ≥ 15 
reporting no prior history of diagnosed OSA. Short sleep dura-
tion affected 61% of participants, which is higher than observed 
in other studies with actigraphy among African Americans [3]. 
Almost a third of the population had low sleep efficiency and 
reported daytime sleepiness. Insomnia symptoms were also 
common, affecting almost 22% of the sample. However, insom-
nia and sleep patterns by actigraphy were not associated with 
OSA. There was a clear burden of sleep deficiency and sleep 
disorders among the population. The weak inter-relationships 
among the measured sleep parameters suggest that there are 
likely multiple factors that negatively affect sleep health in 
this population. Although some studies suggest that insom-
nia and OSA frequently overlap, particularly in women [31], we 
did not observe such a pattern in this population. The major-
ity of research pertaining to OSA has been conducted among 
non-Hispanic white populations. Although data are limited and 
mixed, some prior studies have shown that African Americans 
have a high prevalence of OSA [3, 13, 14, 32]. Thus, it is impor-
tant to understand the factors that contribute to this high bur-
den. Limited data are available from prior studies of African

 Americans for comparison with our results. However, among 
participants in MESA (N = 2230) with an average age of 68, 30.3% 
had an AHI ≥ 15, which is similar to the distribution observed in 
the current study [3]. In the same study, Chen et al. reported that 
84% of African American participants with polysomnography-
defined OSA were undiagnosed [3]. In contrast, in the current 
study, we found a higher proportion (95%) of undiagnosed OSA 
among those with clinically significant OSA levels, and thus a 
higher proportion of individuals with untreated OSA. Study dif-
ferences may be attributable to sociodemographic and/or geo-
graphic differences between the cohorts. Overall, however, the 
findings of prior studies are consistent with our own observa-
tion of a high prevalence of undiagnosed OSA among African 
Americans, emphasizing the need to understand the contribut-
ing factors.
Given the paucity of data addressing OSA in African 
Americans, we explored a variety of risk factors and correlates 
of OSA. Our findings were consistent with previous studies. For 
example, data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (predominately 
non-Hispanic white) demonstrated that male sex, age, BMI, 
neck girth, and snoring were independently related to OSA [33]. 
Habitual snoring strongly associates with OSA in both the prior 
and current studies. Snoring is commonly measured to assess 
OSA risk [33–35] and is reflective of dynamic changes in airway 
narrowing, a fundamental mechanism for OSA. Sleepiness, a 
symptom used to grade severity of OSA and reflective of sleep 
disruption, was unexpectedly not associated with OSA. Given 
the high prevalence of both sleepiness and short sleep duration, 
it is plausible that the specificity of sleepiness as a symptom for 
OSA was reduced in this sample of community-dwelling indi-
viduals. Despite the possibility that markers of disrupted sleep 
may correlate with OSA [36–38], we did not observe that either 
insomnia symptoms or actigraphy-based sleep duration or effi-
ciency was associated with OSA after age, sex, and BMI. This 
also may be due to the multiple contributors to poor sleep in 
this sample. However, our findings on sleep symptoms and OSA 
are similar to prior research among Hispanics, which also dem-
onstrated that snoring but not other sleep symptoms predicted 
OSA, which underscores the importance of habitual snoring as 
a marker of OSA [39].
In men and women, OSA prevalence increased in association 
with both increasing BMI and neck circumference. Furthermore, 
neck circumference but not waist circumference was associated 
with OSA even after adjusting for BMI. Although alternative OSA 
tools utilize either neck or waist circumference to predict indi-
viduals at high risk for OSA [40, 41], our findings suggest that 
among a generally obese African American adult sample, neck 
circumference has greater utility. Screening tools such as the 
NoSAS score [42] which incorporates neck circumference, BMI, 
snoring, age, and sex may perform better in identifying African 
Americans at risk for OSA and should be evaluated in this 
population.
After adjusting for age, sex, and BMI, we did not observe sig-
nificant associations between OSA and hypertension or diabe-
tes. However, the odds ratio for hypertension and diabetes in 
relationship to OSA in the current study was similar to the one 
observed in the Study of Latinos/Hispanic Community Health 
Study (SOL/HCHS) [19]. The significant association observed in 
SOL/HCHS is likely due to its larger sample size.
There is growing interest in sex differences in the preva-
lence and mechanisms of OSA. We observed a narrower dif-
ference in the prevalence of OSA between men and women 
(12%–15%) than reported previously. In the SOL/HCHS, the 
prevalence of OSA was approximately 30%–40% higher in 
men than in women, even among those older than 50 years 
of age [19]. Differences in the sex-stratified prevalence rates 
between the prior study and current study are likely due to 
the older age (predominately postmenopausal women) and 
higher BMI in the current study and may also be attributable 
to the racial/ethnic composition. Snoring was similarly associ-
ated with OSA in men and women, which is consistent with 
studies of other samples [43]. An association between diabetes 
and OSA appeared to be stronger in men than in women, but 
the interaction test was not significant. This result contrasts 
with a prior study (predominantly non-Hispanic white), which 
reported an association between OSA and diabetes in women, 
but not men; this may reflect differences due to ethnicity or 
other, unidentified factors [44]. Additional research is needed 
to clarify whether associations between cardiometabolic dis-
ease and OSA differ by sex.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its 
size to conduct objective OSA testing and administer vali-
dated questionnaires in a sample of African Americans. Study 
strengths included the availability of a comprehensive set of 
anthropometric, physiological, and sleep (including 7 day actig-
raphy) measurements for analysis. We scored hypopneas using 
alternative definitions, allowing us to explore the impact of AHI 
definition on prevalence rates and associations. The study also 
has several limitations. Use of a type 3 sleep apnea monitor pre-
cluded assessment of sleep stages; furthermore, these devices 
may underestimate AHI by 10 to 15% [23]. However, we edited 
sleep time using a validated approach that minimizes misclas-
sification [23]. The sensitivity and specificity of the ESS may be 
limited among individuals with a high prevalence of short sleep 
duration and who may have had sleepiness for many years and 
thus may not adequately recognize this as a problem. Our popu-
lation of African Americans in Jackson, MS may not be repre-
sentative of others in the United States, due to geographic or 
cultural differences. The findings of this paper may not general-
ize to populations of lower education; fifty-four% of our sample 
has a college degree. It is important to consider that OSA prev-
alence rates will vary over time and across cohorts according 
to the sensors used to detect respiratory events (thermal sen-
sors vs. nasal pressure) as well as the definition of hypopneas

 (e.g. level of desaturation). This is evidenced by the difference in 
prevalence rates (37.2% and 23.6%) observed in the current study 
when using a 3 or 4% definition, respectively. Nevertheless, it is 
evident that there is a substantial burden of OSA, predominantly 
undiagnosed and untreated, in this population, and a critical 
need for interventions to increase screening and treatment.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we found a high prevalence of OSA among a 
large population of African American men and women, the 
majority (95%) of whom were undiagnosed and untreated. 
Although male sex, BMI, neck circumference, and snoring 
were associated with OSA, neither sleepiness nor waist cir-
cumference (after adjusting for BMI) was associated with OSA. 
Our results suggest that screening tools [42] that incorporate 
information on neck rather than waist circumference and 
snoring more so than sleepiness may perform better in some 
community-dwelling African American populations. Moreover, 
future-screening procedures may need to more directly assess 
OSA (e.g. using oximetry or other objective testing) and be 
utilized in populations of men and women with high rates 
of overweight/obesity, including under-represented minority 
groups. Given the known association between OSA and poor 
health outcomes [45], intervention studies are needed to iden-
tify improved ways to screen and diagnose individuals, and 
evaluate the impact of OSA treatment on health outcomes and 
health disparities.
