Viral infection during pregnancy has been correlated with increased frequency of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. This observation has been modeled in rodents
subjected to maternal immune activation (MIA). The immune cell populations critical in
the MIA model have not been identified. Using both genetic mutants and blocking
antibodies in mice, we show that retinoic acid receptor–related orphan nuclear receptor
gamma t (RORgt)–dependent effector T lymphocytes [for example,T helper 17 (TH17) cells]
and the effector cytokine interleukin-17a (IL-17a) are required in mothers for MIA-induced
behavioral abnormalities in offspring. We find that MIA induces an abnormal cortical
phenotype, which is also dependent on maternal IL-17a, in the fetal brain. Our data suggest
that therapeutic targeting of TH17 cells in susceptible pregnant mothers may reduce the
likelihood of bearing children with inflammation-induced ASD-like phenotypes.
S
everal studies have suggested that viral in-
fection of women during pregnancy corre-
lates with an increased frequency of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) in the offspring
(1–6). In the rodent maternal immune ac-
tivation (MIA) model of this phenomenon (7), off-
spring from pregnant mice infected with virus or
injected intraperitoneally with synthetic double-
stranded RNA (dsRNA) [poly(I:C)], a mimic of
viral infection, exhibit behavioral symptoms
reminiscent of ASD: social deficits, abnormal
communication, and repetitive behaviors (8). T
helper 17 (TH17) cells are responsible for immune
responses against extracellular bacteria and fungi,
and their dysregulation is thought to underlie
numerous inflammatory and autoimmune dis-
eases (9), such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis,
psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and
multiple sclerosis. The transcription factor reti-
noic acid receptor–related orphan nuclear recep-
tor gamma t (RORgt) is expressed in several cell
types in the immune system. It is a key transcrip-
tional regulator for the development of TH17 cells,
aswell as gd T cells and innate lymphoid cells (such
as ILC3) that express TH17 cell–like cytokines, in
both humans and mice (10–13).
TH17 cells and their cytokine mediators have
been suggested to have a role in ASD. For exam-
ple, elevated levels of interleukin-17a (IL-17a), the
predominant TH17 cytokine, have been detected
in the serum of a subset of autistic children (14, 15).
A genome-wide copy number variant (CNV)analy-
sis identified IL17A as one of many genes enriched
inautisticpatients (16). Similarly, inthe MIA mouse
model, CD4+Tlymphocytesfromaffectedoffspring
produced higher levels of IL-17a upon in vitro
activation (17, 18). Although these data suggest
that TH17 cells may be involved in ASD patients,
whether TH17 cells are the specific immune cell
population that is necessary for MIA phenotypes
is unknown. Here, we show that maternal RORgt-
expressing proinflammatory T cells, a major
source of IL-17a, are required in the MIA model
for induction of ASD-like phenotypes in off-
spring. Consistent with this notion, antibody
blockade of IL-17a activity in pregnant mice
protected against the development of MIA-
induced behavioral abnormalities in the offspring.
Also, we found atypical cortical development
in affected offspring, and this abnormality was
rescued by inhibition of maternal TH17–IL-17a
pathways.
Elevated fetal brain IL-17Ra mRNA
follows increased maternal IL-17a in MIA
Pregnant mothers injected with poly(I:C) on em-
bryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) had strong induction of
serum cytokines IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a), interferon-b (IFN-b), and IL-1b at 3 hours,
compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)–
injected control dams (Fig. 1A and fig. S1, A to
C). Additionally, poly(I:C) injection resulted in
a strong increase of serum IL-17a at E14.5 (Fig.
1B). On the other hand, poly(I:C) did not affect the
levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in
the serum nor in placenta and decidua extracts
(fig. S1D). It was previously shown that the pro-
inflammatory effector cytokine IL-6, a key factor
for TH17 cell differentiation (19), is required in
pregnant mothers for MIA to produce ASD-like
phenotypes in the offspring (7). We found that
poly(I:C) injection into pregnant dams lacking
IL-6 [IL-6 knockout (KO)] failed to increase the
serum levels of IL-17a at E14.5, consistent with
IL-6 acting upstream of IL-17a. Conversely, recom-
binant IL-6 injections into wild-type (WT) mothers
were sufficient to induce IL-17a levels compara-
ble to those of poly(I:C)-injected WT mothers (fig.
S1E). Placenta- and decidua-associated mono-
nuclear cells, isolated from poly(I:C)-treated ani-
mals at E14.5 and cultured for 24 hours, expressed
amounts of IL-6 mRNA similar to those of PBS
controls (Fig. 1C). In contrast, IL-17a mRNA expres-
sion in these cells was strongly up-regulated by
poly(I:C)injection(Fig. 1D). Thisincrease inmRNA
expression was correlated with enhanced secre-
tion of IL-17a by placenta- and decidua-associated
mononuclear cells from poly(I:C)-treated dams
(Fig. 1E), upon ex vivo stimulation with phorbol-
myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, which
mimics T cell receptor (TCR) activation. IL-17a
induction was specific to the placenta and de-
cidua, as small intestine mononuclear cells from
poly(I:C)-treated pregnant dams did not secrete
more IL-17a than those from PBS-treated con-
trols (fig. S1F).
We also observed that expression of the IL-17a
receptor subunit A (IL-17Ra) mRNA, but not sub-
unit C (IL-17Rc) mRNA, was strongly augmented
in the fetal brain upon induction of MIA (Fig. 1, F
and G). By in situ hybridization, IL-17Ra mRNA
was detected in the mouse cortex, and its ex-
pression was strongly up-regulated in E14.5 fetal
brains after poly(I:C) injection of pregnant dams
(Fig. 1, H and I). The in situ probe detecting
endogenous expression of IL-17Ra was specific, as
it did not produce detectable signal in E14.5 fetal
brain that lacks IL-17Ra (fig. S2).
Maternal IL-17a promotes abnormal
cortical development in offspring
We next investigated if pathological activation of
the IL-17 pathway in pregnant mothers affects
fetal brain development and subsequently con-
tributes to the ASD-like behavioral phenotypes
in offspring. To test this hypothesis, we pretreated
pregnant mothers with isotype control or IL-17a–
blocking antibodies before injecting them with
PBS or poly(I:C) (fig. S3). We then examined cor-
tical development in the fetus for the following
reasons: (i) Poly(I:C) injection of mothers increases
IL-17Ra expression in the cortex of the fetal brain
(Fig. 1, H and I); (ii) cortical development starts
at about E11 (20), which aligns well with the time
points of potential fetal exposure to MIA (7); (iii)
disorganized cortex and focal patches of abnor-
mal laminar cytoarchitecture have been found in

Downloaded from 
 the brains of ASD patients (21, 22); and (iv) MIA
has been shown to affect cortical development
(23, 24). We analyzed cortical lamination, an or-
derly layered structure of the cortex, in fetal brains
at E14.5 and E18.5, as well as in the adult brain,
using antibodies specific for proteins expressed in
the cortex in a layer-specific manner (25): special
AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2) (26),
T-brain-1 (TBR1) (27), and chicken ovalbumin up-
stream promoter transcription factor–interacting
protein 2 (CTIP2) (28). MIA led to delayed ex-
pression of SATB2 at E14.5 compared with fetuses
of control animals (Fig. 2, A and C). At E18.5, MIA
resulted in a patch of disorganized cortical cyto-
architecture (Fig. 2, B and D to G) but did not affect
cortical thickness of the fetal brains (Fig. 2H). This
singular patch of disorganized cortex occurred
at a similar medial-lateral position in a majority
of E18.5 fetal brains (Fig. 2, E and G) derived from
mothers injected with poly(I:C) but not those in-
jected with PBS. The abnormal expression patterns
of SATB2, TBR1, and CTIP2 were maintained in
adult MIA offspring (fig. S4). Note that normal
expression of these cortical layer–specific markers,
as well as laminar cortical organization, were
largely preserved in the offspring of poly(I:C)-
injected mothers pretreated with IL-17a–blocking
antibody (Fig. 2, A to D, and fig. S4).
Pretreatment with IL-17a–blocking antibody
also suppressed the MIA-mediated increase in
IL-17Ra mRNA expression in fetal brain at E14.5
(Fig. 1F). This suppression was accompanied by a
reduction in maternal serum IL-17a (Fig. 1B),
which indicated that the up-regulation of IL-17Ra
mRNA in fetal brains requires maternal IL-17a
signaling. Of note, IL-17a antibody blockade of the
IL-17a–IL-17Ra signaling pathway did not result in
a concomitant increase of the serum IL-10 levels,
and IL-17a mRNA expression was not detected in
fetal brain at E14.5, regardless of poly(I:C) injec-
tion. Together, these data demonstrate that the
maternal IL-17a–dependent pathway mediates
disorganized cortical phenotypes in offspring af-
ter in utero MIA and suggest that this may be due
to exposure of the fetus and its brain to increased
levels of IL-17a.
Maternal IL-17a promotes ASD-like
behavioral abnormalities in offspring
We next tested the functional relevance of the
maternal IL-17a pathway for MIA-induced ASD-
like behavioral abnormalities in offspring (fig.
S3). We first assessed MIA offspring for abnor-
mal communication by measuring pup ultra-
sonic vocalization (USV) responses (29). After
separation from mothers, pups from poly(I:C)-
injected mothers pretreated with immunoglo-
bulin G (IgG) isotype control antibody emitted
more USV calls than those from PBS-injected
mothers (Fig. 3A), in agreement with previous
studies (29, 30). Some studies have reported
reduced USV calls upon MIA (8, 31), but these
opposite effects may reflect differences in meth-
odological approaches, including dose and num-
ber of exposures to poly(I:C), as well as timing of
poly(I:C) administration. Altogether, these results
indicate that MIA induces abnormal USV in
offspring. Pretreating poly(I:C)-injected mothers
with IL-17a–blocking antibody resulted in off-
spring that emitted a similar number of USV calls
as the pups from PBS-injected control mothers
(Fig. 3A), which demonstrated that IL-17a–
mediated signaling events are necessary for the
MIA-induced abnormal USV phenotype. As pre-
viously reported (7, 8), we found that prenatal
exposure to MIA also caused social interaction de-
ficits in adult offspring (Fig. 3B). This defect was
fully rescued in offspring from poly(I:C)-injected

 RORgt expression in maternal T cells is

pathway (13), we next investigated the role of ma-
ternal RORgt in MIA-induced behavioral pheno-
types in offspring. Note that TH17 cells and IL-17a
have been detected in the decidua, as well as in
the serum, during pregnancy in humans (33–35).

activated WT mothers, but not from immune-
activated mothers lacking both RORgt and the
closely related RORg isoform (RORg KO), pro-
duced IL-17a upon ex vivo activation with PMA
and ionomycin (fig. S6, A and B). Cells isolated
from WT and RORg KO mice secreted similar
amounts of IFN-g, consistent with the specific
effect of RORgt on IL-17a expression (fig. S6C). In
line with this observation, poly(I:C) treatment
increased placenta- and decidua-associated TH17,
but not regulatory T, cells in pregnant dams, com-
pared with PBS treatment (fig. S6, D and E). RORg
KO mice lack RORg and gt expression not only in
CD4+ T cells but also in other lymphoid and non-
immune system cells, and they have defective
development of secondary and tertiary lymphoid
organs (36, 37). To determine whether RORgt
function specifically in T cells mediates MIA-
induced phenotypes, we bred RORgtFL animals
(fig. S7) to CD4-Cre mice to selectively inactivate
rorc(t) in the T cells of pregnant mothers (RORgt
TKO) (38). In these animals, the functions of
TH17 cells (CD4+RORgt+ cells) and other RORgt-
expressing abT cells are inhibited, but there is no
effect in RORgt-expressing innate (or innate-
like) immune cells, including gdT, lymphoid tissue-
inducer cells, and ILC3 cells (11, 12), as well as in
RORg-expressing nonlymphoid cells. We found
that RORgt TKO mothers failed to produce IL-
17a even after poly(I:C) injection (fig. S6F). Note
that poly(I:C)-induced malformation of the cortex
was prevented in offspring from RORgt TKO
mothers (Fig. 4, A and B), similar to the results
from anti–IL-17a treatment (Fig. 2, B and D).
Moreover, we found that prenatal exposure to
MIA increased USV calls in pups derived from
WT or RORgt heterozygous (HET) mothers, but
offspring of RORgt TKO mothers had normal
USV behavior (Fig. 4C). T cell–specific deletion of
maternal RORgt also abrogated the MIA-induced
social interaction deficit and excessive marble
burying in offspring (Fig. 4, D and E). These re-
sults were not due to general activity defects in
the offspring of WT, RORgt HET or TKO mothers
(Fig. 4F). Because these offspring were derived
from mating RORgt WT, HET and TKO female
with WT male mice, they all carried at least one
copy of functional RORgt. Therefore, the rescue
of MIA-induced phenotypes observed in the off-
spring of RORgt TKO mothers was not likely due
to the lack of TH17 cells in the offspring. Taken
together, these data indicate that maternal CD4+
T lymphocytes expressing RORgt (i.e., TH17 cells)
are necessary for the MIA-mediated expression
of cortical abnormalities and three ASD-like be-
haviors modeled in mouse offspring.
IL-17a administration to the fetal brain
promotes abnormal cortical
development and ASD-like
behavioral phenotypes
To determine whether IL-17a acts on receptors in
the mother or the fetus to induce the MIA phe-
notype, we injected poly(I:C) into IL-17Ra WT,
HET, or KO mothers that had been bred to
IL-17Ra WT or HET males (39). Removing one or
both copies of il17ra in the mother was sufficient
to rescue the MIA-induced sociability deficit in
offspring, regardless of their genotypes (fig. S8A).
Moreover, we found that reduced expression of
maternal IL-17Ra in il17ra HET mothers led to
reduced serum IL-17a in poly(I:C)-treated mothers
(fig. S8B). Thus, it is difficult, if not impossible, to
test the functional significance of the IL-17Ra in
offspring with a full germline il17ra KO without
affecting maternal TH17 cell activity. To circum-
vent this problem, we asked if increasing IL-17Ra
activity in the offspring, by introducing IL-17a di-
rectly into the fetal brain in the absence of mater-
nal inflammation, would be sufficient to induce
MIA phenotypes. Injection of recombinant IL-17a
protein into the ventricles of the fetal brain at
E14.5 in the absence of MIA (Fig. 5A) led to the
appearance of disorganized cortical patches in a
similar location to those induced by MIA (Fig. 5,
B to E). Unlike poly(I:C) injection, however, intra-
ventricular injection of IL-17a resulted in thinned
cortical plates at the medial but not lateral part
of the brain (fig. S9). This effect may reflect

 differences in the levels or types of inflammation
associated with poly(I:C) versus IL-17a injections
or the time points at which poly(I:C) (E12.5) and
IL-17a (E14.5) were administered. We also found
that, compared with sham injection, IL-17a injec-
tions led to an enhanced USV phenotype, social
approach deficit, and increased marble-burying
behavior, all similar in magnitude to those ob-
served in MIA-exposed offspring (Fig. 5, F to H).
These behavioral abnormalities were not due to
group differences in mobility (Fig. 5I). Neither
cortical disorganization nor enhanced USV phe-
notypes were observed after IL-17a injections into
the ventricles of IL-17Ra KO fetuses or upon IL-6
injections into WT fetal brains (fig. S10, A to C),
which suggests that IL-17a, but not IL-6, acts di-
rectly in the fetal brain to induce these pheno-
types. Of note, in agreement with previous reports
(7, 40), IL-6 injection into pregnant WT mothers
was sufficient to produce MIA-associated behav-
ioral (enhanced USV) and cortical phenotypes in
the offspring (fig. S10, D to F). Yet, pretreatment
of pregnant mothers with IL-17a–blocking anti-
body prevented the phenotypes induced by ma-
ternal IL-6 injection (fig. S10, D to F). Last, IL-17a
injection into brains of fetuses from poly(I:C)-
injected IL-6 KO mothers was sufficient to elicit
increased pup USVs compared with PBS-injected
controls (fig. S10G). These data collectively dem-
onstrate that activation of the IL-17Ra pathway
in the fetal brain, induced by intraventricular
injection of IL-17a into the fetus or by intraperi-
toneal injection of poly(I:C) or IL-6 into pregnant
mothers, results in MIA-associated phenotypes
in the offspring.
Therapeutic treatment with
IL-17a–blocking antibody in pregnant
dams ameliorates MIA-associated
behavioral abnormalities
Our results suggest that pathological activation
of the TH17 cell–IL-17a pathway during gestation
in mothers with some inflammatory conditions
may alter fetal brain development and contrib-
ute to the ASD-like behavioral phenotypes in off-
spring (fig. S11). TH17 cells require RORgt for
their differentiation and exert their functions
by secreting multiple cytokines, including IL-
17a. Abrogation of RORgt expression in maternal
ab T cells or blockade of the IL-17a pathway in
pregnant dams resulted in the complete rescue
of cortical developmental abnormalities and ASD-
like behavioral phenotypes in offspring in the
MIA rodent model. Thus, RORgt and TH17 cells
(as well as their cytokines) may serve as good
therapeutic targets to prevent the development
of ASD phenotypes in the children of susceptible
mothers. To further test this idea, we adminis-
tered IL-17a–blocking antibody to pregnant mice in
a time window after MIA induction (Fig. 6A). We
injected pregnant mothers with PBS or poly(I:C)
at E12.5, followed by injection of IgG isotype
control or IL-17a–blocking antibody at E14.5, when
the delayed expression of SABT2 manifests in
MIA-exposed fetal brains (Fig. 2, A and C). Com-
pared with PBS injection followed by control
antibody treatment, poly(I:C) injection followed
by IL-17a–blocking antibody administration
partially rescued USV and marble-burying pheno-
types (Fig. 6, B and D). However, MIA-induced
social interaction deficits were not corrected (Fig.
6C). These effects were not due to group differ-
ences in mobility (Fig. 6E). Thus, treating preg-
nant mothers with IL-17a–blocking antibody after
MIA can correct some of the ASD-like features,
but pretreatment with this antibody may have
greater therapeutic potential.
Conclusions
Our results identify a specific maternal immune
cell population that may have direct roles in
inducing ASD-like phenotypes by acting on the
developing fetal brain. These findings raise the
possibility that modulation of the activity of a
cytokine receptor, IL-17Ra, in the central nervous
system can influence neuronal development, with
implications as to specification of neuronal cell
types and their connectivity. Furthermore, note
that the loss of certain genes that induce ASD-like
phenotypes were also found in mice with defects
in cortical lamination (41, 42). These observations
raise the possibility that some genetic and envi-
ronmental factors that have roles in the etiology
of ASD function by way of similar physiolog-
ical pathways. A related question is whether IL-
17Ra signaling has a normal physiological function
in the fetal and adult brain, especially given the
structural similarities observed between the IL-17
family cytokines and neurotrophin proteins (e.g.,
nerve growth factor) (43, 44). Elucidating fur-
ther downstream pathways of maternal IL-17a–
producing T cells, both in MIA mothers and
their offspring, will likely yield a better under-
standing of the mechanisms by which inflam-
mation in utero contributes to the development
of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD,

MEIOSIS
A DNA topoisomerase VI–like
complex initiates
meiotic recombination

The SPO11 protein catalyzes the formation of meiotic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and
is homologous to the A subunit ofan archaeal topoisomerase (topo VI).T
opo VI are heterotetrameric
enzymes comprising two A and two B subunits; however, no topo VIB involved in meiotic
recombination had been identified.We characterized a structural homolog of the archaeal topo
VIB subunit [meiotic topoisomerase VIB–like (MTOPVIB)], which is essential for meiotic DSB
formation. It forms a complex with the two Arabidopsis thaliana SPO11 orthologs required for meiotic
DSB formation (SPO11-1 and SPO11-2) and is absolutely required for the formation of the
SPO11-1/SPO11-2 heterodimer.These findings suggest that the catalytic core complex responsible
for meiotic DSB formation in eukaryotes adopts a topo VI–like structure.
M
eiotic recombination is the key step in
sexual reproduction leading to the pro-
duction of haploid gametes and is there-
fore essential for the fertility of most
eukaryotes. It is initiated by the induc-
tion of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which
are catalyzed by the evolutionarily conserved
SPO11 protein (1). SPO11 shows sequence sim-
ilarities to the A subunit of the archaeal type II
DNA topoisomerase, topoisomerase VI (topo VI)
(2). Topo VI enzymes relax DNA supercoils by
cutting both DNA strands of a DNA helix in an
adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–dependent man-
ner, forcing the passage of another DNA duplex
through the generated break and eventually rel-
igating the break, regenerating an intact DNA
molecule (3). Topo VI enzymes are active as
heterotetramers, composed of two A and two B
subunits. The two topo VIA subunits carry the
catalytically active tyrosines and associate as a
dimer to form the catalytic core of the topo VI
enzyme (2). The topo VIB subunits contain an
ATP-binding domain known as the Bergerat fold,
which is characteristic of the GHKL (Gyrase,
HSP90, histidine kinase, MutL) superfamily (2, 4).
Topo VIB also possess a C-terminal transducer
domain thattransfers the conformational changes
induced by ATP binding and hydrolysis from the
GHKL to the catalytic A subunits (5). On the basis
of the similarity between SPO11 and topo VIA, and
because SPO11 can be purified covalently associ-
ated with the meiotic DSB ends (6), it was pro-
posed that at the onset of meiotic recombination,
SPO11 dimerizes to form the catalytic core respon-
sible for DNA DSB formation. In Arabidopsis
thaliana, genetic analyses revealed that two non-
redundant SPO11 homologs (SPO11-1 and SPO11-
2) are absolutely required for DSB formation (7–9),
suggesting that meiotic DSBs are catalyzed by a
SPO11-1/SPO11-2 heterodimer rather than a homo-
dimer. Although most eukaryotic lineages possess
at least one SPO11 protein, until now no topo VIB
homolog involved in meiotic recombination had
been identified. Here, we present the first charac-
terization of a structural homolog of the archaeal
topo VIB subunit required for meiotic DSB forma-
tion. We show that it mediates the formation of
