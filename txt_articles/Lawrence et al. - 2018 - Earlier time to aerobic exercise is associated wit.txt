Abstract
Objective
To determine whether earlier time to initiation of aerobic exercise following acute concussion
is associated with time to full return to (1) sport and (2) school or work.
Methods
A retrospective stratified propensity score survival analysis of acute (�14 days) concussion
was used to determine whether time (days) to initiation of aerobic exercise post-concussion
was associated with, both, time (days) to full return to (1) sport and (2) school or work.
Results
A total of 253 acute concussions [median (IQR) age, 17.0 (15.0–20.0) years; 148 (58.5%)
males] were included in this study. Multivariate Cox regression models identified that earlier
time to aerobic exercise was associated with faster return to sport and school/work adjusting
for other covariates, including quintile propensity strata. For each successive day in delay to
initiation of aerobic exercise, individuals had a less favourable recovery trajectory. Initiating
aerobic exercise at 3 and 7 days following injury was associated with a respective 36.5%
(HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53–0.76) and 73.2% (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16–0.45) reduced probabil-
ity of faster full return to sport compared to within 1 day; and a respective 45.9% (HR, 0.54;
95% CI, 0.44–0.66) and 83.1% (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.10–0.30) reduced probability of faster
full return to school/work. Additionally, concussion history, symptom severity, LOC deleteri-
ously influenced concussion recovery.
Conclusion
Earlier initiation of aerobic exercise was associated with faster full return to sport and school
or work. This study provides greater insight into the benefits and safety of aerobic exercise
within the first week of the injury.

 Introduction
Concussion guidelines uniformly recommend a brief period (24 to 48 hours) of cognitive and
physical “rest” acutely, followed by a gradual and progressive return to activity [1]. The evi-
dence supporting acute rest as an intervention is sparse and largely based on consensus state-
ments, early animal studies, and an understanding of the neurometabolic pathophysiology of
concussion [2–4]. Complete or strict rest, protracted rest, and rest until symptom resolution
has been shown to be ineffective and potentially hazardous following concussion and is no
longer recommended [1, 5–7]. Similarly, acute strenuous physical and cognitive exertion can
exacerbate symptom burden, increase risk of secondary injury, and should also be discouraged
[8]. However, despite graded re-integration of physical activity being fundamental in concus-
sion management, the optimal type of activity, intensity, duration, and time to initiation fol-
lowing acute concussion are not well elucidated [2–6, 8, 9].
Emerging evidence is documenting a protective effect of active rehabilitative interventions,
including physical activity, in the management of concussion [4, 10]. Early introduction of aer-
obic exercise has been shown to be safe and potentially beneficial in reducing symptom burden
and the risk of prolonged symptoms following concussion [8, 11, 12]. Several studies have
examined the effect of recommending rest after acute concussion [2–7]; however, there is lim-
ited evidence investigating the effect of physical activity in the acute period. In a large prospec-
tive cohort study, Grool et al. demonstrated that children and adolescents who engaged in
physical activity within 7 days of injury, compared to those who did not, had a reduced risk of
persistent symptoms at 28 days [11]. Furthermore, treatment of persistent concussion symp-
toms with aerobic activity and exercise has demonstrated a protective effect in reducing the
severity and prevalence of concussion symptoms [13–17]. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis,
including all time points of exercise initiation post-concussion, concluded that aerobic exercise
can improve concussion symptom burden following concussion [12].
Investigations to date examining physical activity following acute concussion have been
limited in their ability to evaluate the effectiveness aerobic exercise within the 7-day period
immediately following a concussive injury [11]. Despite the growing evidence supporting
physical activity and aerobic exercise following concussion, additional evidence is required to
inform the optimal activity type, intensity, duration, and timing of intervention. The objective
of this study was to examine the effect of time to initiation of aerobic exercise on the time to
recovery following acute concussion.
Material and methods
A retrospective study design with consecutive sampling was used to collect data on all acute
physician diagnosed concussions presenting to an academic sports medicine clinic from Octo-
ber 2016 to December 2017. The academic sports medicine clinic has ten active sports medi-
cine physicians, all of whom provide concussion care in alignment with the most recent
Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport [1].
All concussions were sport-related and were included if they were ‘acute’, defined for the
purpose of this study as presenting 14 days or less following the injury. All ages, sport, and
skill levels were included. Concussions were excluded if the index or ‘presenting’ concussive
injury occurred during the recovery of a previous concussion or a secondary concussive event
occurred during the recovery of the index injury. University of Toronto research ethics board
provided ethical approval for this study; participant consent was deemed not required given
the low potential for risk/harm and retrospective nature of the study. Although data collection
was retrospective with respect to the time of the study, coders were blinded to the main out-
come variables when collecting data on exposure variables.

 Aerobic exercise and exposure variables
The primary exposure of interest was the time (days from injury) to the initiation of aerobic
exercise following concussion, either self-initiated or physician-prescribed. The time at which
aerobic exercise was initiated was captured for all concussion injuries through the use of stan-
dardized reporting concussion forms. Self-initiated aerobic exercise was defined as jogging,
running, swimming, cycling, or utilization of stationary aerobic equipment.
All physician-prescribed activity followed the graded return to activity guidelines, as per the
Berlin Consensus Statement [1]. Physician-prescribed aerobic exercise uniformly commenced
with aerobic exercise involving a standardized stationary bike protocol, with minimal head
movement/acceleration and increasing levels of exertion and intensity. The standardized sta-
tionary bike protocol is as follows: 15 minutes (min) maintaining 100–120 beats per minute
(bpm), followed by 30 min at 100–120 bpm, followed by 30 min at 140 bpm, followed by inter-
vals of a 1 min maximal sprint every 5 minutes for a total of 30 min. A minimum of 2 sessions
tolerated at each level is recommended prior to progression to the next level. Physician pre-
scribed aerobic exercise was not deferred until symptom resolution, as per the Consensus
Statement and growing concussion literature [1].
The time at which the prescribed exercise was initiated, as opposed to prescribed, was used
to define the time to exposure. The time to first exposure to aerobic exercise, either self-initi-
ated or physician-prescribed, was used to define the main exposure in individuals who both
self-initiated and were prescribed exercise. Day one for the time to initiation of aerobic exer-
cise was defined as within 24 hours of the time of injury and failure to be removed from play
was not coded as initiating aerobic exercise.
Data pertaining to additional covariates of interest were collected including age, sex, num-
ber of previous concussions, time to first assessment (days), initial symptom severity (based on
the symptom checklist from the Sideline Concussion Assessment Tool [SCAT 3 & 5]), loss of
consciousness (LOC), post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), history of psychiatric illness, history of
headache disorder (including migraines), and history of learning disability (including atten-
tion deficit hyperactivity disorder) [18, 19].
Main outcomes
The main outcomes evaluated for all participants were time (days from injury) to full return to
(1) sport and (2) school or work (school/work). This approach allowed for the assessment of
recovery within both a predominantly physical (sport) and cognitive (school/work) domain.
All acute concussions were serially followed until the individual had fully returned or was
cleared to fully return to sport and school/work. The outcomes of interest were defined as the
time to (i) full return, as assessed by the sports physician, or (ii) physician clearance for full
return. Physician determination of full return to a functional domain is individualized and
relies on a combination of symptom state, current and premorbid baseline function, and
objective assessments. During data collection, the time to initiation of aerobic exercise was col-
lected blinded to the time to full return to sport and school/work.
Propensity score stratification
Covariate balancing propensity scores (CBPS) for a continuous treatment (i.e. time-to-aerobic
exercise) were estimated to calculate the conditional probability of exposure to the variable of
interest accounting for additional observed variables [20]. The potential confounders for pro-
pensity score balancing were selected based on literature review and a piori hypothesis [21],
and included: age, sex, symptom severity, time to first assessment, LOC, PTA, history of psy-
chiatric condition, and history of a headache disorder.

 Quintile stratification by propensity score was employed to partially control for systematic
differences in the observed variation in the time for individuals to start aerobic exercise post-
concussion [22]. It has been estimated that stratifying on the quintiles of propensity score
estimates can eliminate approximately 90% of the bias resulting from imbalances in covariate
distribution [20, 21]. Quintile strata were included in the final multivariate Cox regression
models (see below) as a nominal categorical variable [22]. Within-quintile main effect analyses
were not performed due to sample size limitations.
Balance diagnostics were carried out to ensure the propensity score model was adequately
specified. An unweighted and CBPS-weighted absolute Pearson correlation were calculated for
each confounder in the CBPS model (Fig 1). Although the main effects Cox models utilized
time to aerobic exercise as a continuous variable, additional balance diagnostics were per-
formed with time to aerobic exercise dichotomized around the median (8 days). These
included the estimation of overall and within-quintile standardized mean differences (SMD)
and correlation coefficients (Pearson and Point-biserial; S1 Table and Fig 2).
Data analysis & main effect survival models
Survival analyses were conducted using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to deter-
mine the association between the time-to-aerobic exercise (days) and time (days) to full return
to (1) sport and (2) school or work (school/work). The main outcome variables were appor-
tioned to capture information on recovery to a predominantly physical (sport) versus cognitive
(school/work) stressor.

 Additional covariates of interest were included in the model based on the previous litera-
ture and a priori hypotheses and included: age, sex, symptom severity, time to first assessment,
LOC, PTA, history of psychiatric condition, history of a headache disorder, and a history of a
learning disorder. As above, the estimated propensity score strata were included in each model
as a nominal categorical variable.
Nonlinearity of the time to aerobic exercise variable was explored using a restricted cubic
spline with three knots. A likelihood ratio test demonstrated the full model, with the nonlinear
term, differed significantly form the reduced model for both Cox models (p<0.001 and
p<0.001, respectively). Moreover, inclusion of this nonlinear term, in addition to stratifying
both models by time to first assessment, preserved the proportional hazards assumption for
both models (p>0.05). Examination of Martingale and Score residuals did not demonstrate
any deviation from linearity or overly influential observations. Variance inflation factors dem-
onstrated no colinearity of any included variables for both models. Predicted hazard-ratios
(HR) were calculated to estimate the effect size for the association between predictor variables
and the probability of a faster return to sport and school/work.
Zero patients were left censored. Patients who were lost to follow up (n = 23 for full return
to sport, n = 15 for full return to school/work) were right censored at the time of the scheduled
follow up appointment. All remaining individuals were followed to full recovery.
A significance level of α < 0.05 was used for all tests. The influence of multiplicity of testing
was carried out using a false discovery rate (FDR). To note, all tests that achieved an initial sig-
nificance of α < 0.05 retained significance after FDR adjustment. All analyses were conducted
using R software v 3.4.3.

 headache disorder, and learning disability was identified in 15.4% (n = 39), 9.5% (n = 24), and
9.1% (n = 23) of the study sample, respectively. A total of 126 individuals (49.8%) reported no
previous concussion, while the mean number of previous concussions in the sample was 0.8
(SD, 1.0).
The majority of the injuries occurred during ice hockey (n = 63, 24.9%), followed by rugby
(n = 31, 12.3%), football (n = 29, 11.5%), and soccer (n = 22, 8.7%). Loss of consciousness and
PTA were reported in 4.7% and 8.3% of the injuries, respectively. The median time to first
assessment was 4.0 days (IQR, 3.0–7.0) and the median symptom severity score was 26.0 (IQR,
12.0–44.0). The median time to aerobic exercise was 8.0 days (IQR, 5.0–12.0) post-injury. The
median time to full return to sport and school/work was 28.0 days (IQR, 17.0–43.0) and 23.0
days (IQR, 15.0–36.0), respectively.
Main effect survival analyses
For each successive day in delay to initiation of aerobic exercise, individuals had a less favour-
able recovery trajectory. Moreover, given the nonlinear association between time to aerobic
exercise and concussion recovery, a stronger protective effect for earlier aerobic exercise was
observed.
For example, initiating aerobic exercise on 3, 5, 7, and 14 days post-injury was associated
with a respective 36.5% (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53–0.76), 59.5% (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.28–0.58),
73.2% (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16–0.45), and 88.9% (HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06–0.22) reduced proba-
bility of faster full return to sport compared to initiating aerobic exercise within 1 day post
injury (p<0.001; Table 2), after adjusting for all other covariates including quintiled propensity
score strata (Fig 3A).
Moreover, initiating aerobic exercise on 3, 5, 7, and 14 days post-injury was associated with
a respective 45.9% (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44–0.66), 70.5% (HR, 0.29; 95% CI 0.20–0.44), 83.1%
(HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.10–0.30), and 94.7% (HR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.03–0.11) reduced probability of
faster full return to school/work compared to initiating aerobic exercise within 1 day post
injury (p<0.001; Table 2), after adjusting for all other covariates including quintiled propensity
score strata (Fig 3B).
The number of previous concussions and LOC had a deleterious effect on time to return to
sport (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71–0.99; p = 0.041 and HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.66; p = 0.003;
respectively), after adjusting for all other covariates. The number of previous concussions and
symptom severity had a deleterious effect on time to return to school/work (HR, 0.84; 95% CI,
0.71–0.99; p = 0.038 and HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.97; p = 0.015; respectively). Age, sex, PTA,
propensity score strata, history of psychiatric condition, headache condition, and learning dis-
ability were not associated with either return to sport or school/work.
Discussion
This study examined the relationship between the time to initiate aerobic exercise following an
acute concussion and the time to full return to sport and school/work with consideration of
known risk modifiers for concussion. Shorter time to initiation of aerobic exercise post-con-
cussion was associated with faster full return to sport and school/work. Furthermore, all indi-
viduals were symptomatic at the time of initiating aerobic exercise; supporting the current
agreement that aerobic exercise is safe and potentially protective in symptomatic individuals.
Our findings provide evidence for the paradigm shift towards an active rehabilitative
approach to the management of acute concussion. Historically, the standard of care after con-
cussion was largely predicated upon experimental animal studies, which identified a decrease
in energy availability in the brain resulting from neurometabolic disruption [23]. From this, it

 was speculated that activity after an injury might exacerbate this metabolic dysfunction,
increase symptoms, and delay recovery [4, 24]; however, empirical evidence in human subjects
has not supported this position. Complete or prolonged rest following concussion has been
shown to increase symptom burden and delay recovery [3–5, 7, 9] and growing evidence is
supporting the introduction of earlier activity in the management of concussion [11]. Despite
the reported benefits of aerobic exercise for those with persistent symptoms [8, 10–14], a
recent systematic review and meta-analysis only identified two studies examining the benefit
of physical exercise following acute concussion (<5 days) [12]. Nonetheless, Lal and colleagues
found “early physical activity” was associated with a lower risk of persistent post-concussion
symptoms [12]. Moreover, moderate levels of exertion (slow jogging and sports practice) dur-
ing concussion recovery demonstrated better neurocognitive outcomes compared to low or
high intensity activities [8].
Graded exercise programs have demonstrated positive impacts on many other central ner-
vous system and medical conditions such as stroke [25], depression [26], anxiety [27], fibro-
myalgia [28], chronic fatigue syndrome [29], and cognitive impairment [4, 30, 31]. Moreover,
aerobic exercise has a protective physiologic effect on multiple organ systems, including the
cardiovascular and pulmonary-, central nervous-, and neuroendocrine- systems and is

 hypothesized to effectuate its positive role in brain health through the promotion of neurogen-
eisis, angiogenesis, and neurotrophic growth factors [32].
Despite our present study findings, which contribute to the growing understanding of the
benefits of activity following acute concussion, more evidence is required to provide a detailed
evidence-based exercise prescription. All exercise prescriptions require several elements out-
lined by the ‘FITT’ principle, including the frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise
[33]. The FITT prescription represents an important construct for exercise prescription;
however, is limited for prescribing exercise post-injury, as it does not elaborate on when an
individual should initiate exercise post injury. Exercise prescription following any injury
(including concussion) should additionally detail recommendations pertaining to the timing
of initiation of exercise post-injury. Therefore, we propose a “FITTT” exercise prescription be
employed for concussion, which includes the aforementioned components with an additional
description of the “time post-injury” recommendation.
This study is consistent with the current understanding of the role of aerobic exercise fol-
lowing concussion and provides additional support for earlier (within 1 week) introduction
of aerobic exercise following acute concussion. This study did not allow for comprehensive
assessment of exercise intensity, type, and symptom response; however, all recommendations
for prescribed exercise involved low impact (stationary bike) sub-symptom threshold exercise.
Further studies, in the form of randomized controlled trials, are required to elucidate more
detailed recommendations for exercise prescriptions post-concussion.
Additional risk modifiers for concussion recovery were explored through this study [18,
19]. A history of concussion, higher symptom burden, and loss of consciousness were associ-
ated with a prolonged recovery, which is consistent with the current understanding surround-
ing these risk modifiers [18, 19]. Increasing awareness and attention is being placed on sex

 differences and outcomes following concussion [18, 19]. Female athletes have been demon-
strated to have an increased risk of sustaining a concussion and report higher symptom
burden compared to male counterparts [18, 19, 34]; however, the evidence on sex-specific
recovery measures is mixed [18]. The results of the current study did not observe a differential
recovery pattern based on sex. Furthermore, age, learning disability, psychiatric history, head-
ache disorder, and post-traumatic amnesia did not predict recovery from acute concussion
based on the results of this study.
This study is limited by several factors. Physician-recommended aerobic exercise was con-
sistent during the study time period and involved a stationary bike protocol with graded
increases in intensity and duration. However, greater variability in the type of exercise was
observed in individuals who self-initiated aerobic exercise post-concussion, with further diffi-
culty in defining the exercise intensity. Moreover, the duration and intensity of self-imitated
exercise were not captured in this study. Although efforts were made to reduce the bias in the
distribution of variables associated with the time at which individuals initiated aerobic exer-
cise, it is recognized residual bias may still exist even after stratification by propensity score
[20, 22]. Statistical modelling and predicted effect sizes of the benefits of initiating aerobic
exercise were demonstrated in this study; however, further examination into the initiation of
aerobic exercise within 28–48 hours of concussion should be undertaken to substantiate these
observations.
Conclusion
This study investigated the association between the time to initiate aerobic exercise following
acute symptomatic concussion and the time to full return to sport and school or work with
consideration of known risk modifiers for concussion. Early aerobic exercise was shown to be
safe and protective in improving recovery time following acute concussion.
