Abstract
Background
Experience of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is associated with mental illness. Advo-
cacy has little effect on mental health outcomes of female DVA survivors and there is uncer-
tainty about the effectiveness of psychological interventions for this population.
Objective
To test effectiveness of a psychological intervention delivered by advocates to DVA
survivors.
Design, masking, setting, participants
Pragmatic parallel group individually randomized controlled trial of normal DVA advocacy
vs. advocacy + psychological intervention. Statistician and researchers blinded to group
assignment. Setting: specialist DVA agencies; two UK cities. Participants: Women aged 16
years and older accessing DVA services.
Intervention
Eight specialist psychological advocacy (SPA) sessions with two follow up sessions.
Measurements
Primary outcomes at 12 months: depression symptoms (PHQ-9) and psychological distress
(CORE-OM). Primary analysis: intention to treat linear (logistic) regression model for contin-
uous (binary) outcomes.

 Results
263 women recruited (78 in shelter/refuge, 185 in community), 2 withdrew (1 community,
control group; 1 intervention, refuge group), 1 was excluded from the study for protocol vio-
lation (community, control group), 130 in intervention and 130 in control groups. Recruitment
ended June 2013. 12-month follow up: 64%. At 12-month follow up greater improvement in
mental health of women in the intervention group. Difference in average CORE-OM score
between intervention and control groups: -3.3 points (95% CI -5.5 to -1.2). Difference in
average PHQ-9 score between intervention and control group: -2.2 (95% CI -4.1 to -0.3). At
12 months, 35% of the intervention group and 55% of the control group were above the
CORE-OM -2clinical threshold (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.64); 29% of the intervention
group and 46% of the control group were above the PHQ-9 clinical threshold (OR 0.41, 95%
CI 0.21 to 0.81),
Limitations
64% retention at 12 months
Conclusions
An eight-session psychological intervention delivered by DVA advocates produced clinically
relevant improvement in mental health outcomes compared with normal advocacy care.

Introduction
Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is a common violation of human rights that damages
physical and mental health. DVA can be physical, sexual, psychological and economic, perpe-
trated by a partner, ex-partner or adult family member. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a
type of DVA. Although DVA is experienced by women and men, the majority of severe,
repeated and sexual assaults are on women [1]. Most DVA epidemiological research has
focused on the impact of intimate partner violence (IPV), a major contributor to the global
burden of disease for women of reproductive age [2]. The main long term association of IPV is
mental illness, with a three-fold risk of depressive disorders, four-fold risk of anxiety disorders
and a seven-fold risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [3]. A meta-analysis of longitu-
dinal studies has established a causal relationship between IPV and depression and suicide
attempts [4].
Psychological interventions, such as counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
that are not adapted to the specific needs of DVA survivors often fail to meet their needs [5].
Psychological interventions may not directly address the violence, and couple or family ther-
apy, in which victim and perpetrator are treated together, are potentially dangerous. Survivors
of DVA have found it unhelpful when interventions do not recognise trauma, make the abuser
invisible by focusing exclusively on the mental health of the victim, (implicitly or explicitly)

 blame the victim for the abuse or her reaction, offer medication rather than counselling and
when a psychiatric diagnosis negatively impacts on care or child contact proceedings [6]. In
contrast, women identify that interventions can be helpful when they are directly asked about
their experiences of DVA, encouraged to name the abuse, helped with safety planning or par-
enting and offered support to recover from their experiences [7].
There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of psychological interventions designed for sur-
vivors of DVA delivered by counsellors or psychotherapists. The systematic review [8] under-
pinning the 2014 UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines [9]
found two randomized controlled trials of brief psychological interventions for IPV survivors
in a refuge and for pregnant women respectively. The former [10], CBT-based, reported
improvement in PTSD symptoms; the latter [11], psychotherapy-based, did not. The NICE
review also reported four other randomized controlled trials testing cognitive processing, CBT
and group therapy, reporting improvement in PTSD and depressive symptoms, but only one
study compared the intervention group with a control group with no psychological interven-
tion. Two trials by Kubany and colleagues [12, 13] not included in that review reported
reduced post-traumatic stress symptoms following an individual cognitive therapy based inter-
vention in DVA survivors who were no longer in abusive relationships. However, the results
from those studies cannot be extrapolated to women suffering from other mental health condi-
tions nor to women still subject to abuse. The World Health Organisation intimate partner
violence and sexual violence guidelines [14] recommend trials with sufficient statistical power
to assess the effectiveness of different models of psychological intervention/therapy for women
survivors of intimate partner violence in a variety of settings. The NICE DVA guidelines [9]
recommend research on the effectiveness of psychological interventions modified for domestic
violence and abuse in the short, medium and long term, across various levels of risk and
including diverse and marginalised groups and programmes for those who have suffered mul-
tiple forms of abuse and those who are still experiencing it. In the United States, with the
advent of universal screening for IPV in health care settings, there is a renewed emphasis on
effective interventions for women disclosing abuse.
In the United Kingdom, domestic violence advocacy or support is provided by a network of
specialist DVA services, most affiliated to the Women’s Aid Federation (http://www.
womensaid.org.uk/). Advocates engage with individual clients who are being or have been
abused, aiming to increase their safety, empower them and link them to community services.
The core activities of advocacy are provision of legal, housing and financial advice, facilitating
access to and use of community resources such as refuges or shelters, emergency housing, pro-
vision of safety planning advice, and ongoing support. The duration and intensity of advocacy
varies within and between agencies. Generally advocates do not have a background or training
in psychological therapies and do not provide counselling or other therapies. While advocacy
may reduce recurrence of violence, its effect on mental health or quality of life is uncertain
[15].
Given the contact that advocates have with women who have recently experienced DVA
and their understanding of the context of abuse, they are a potential source of psychological
support to survivors who seek help from the DVA agencies. Agnew-Davies and colleagues
developed a specific intervention for this population delivered by DVA advocates given addi-
tional training. The Psychological Advocacy Towards Healing (PATH) intervention is based
on concepts and technical strategies drawn from cognitive-behavioural, experiential, dynamic,
psycho-educational and feminist theories [16]. This model was evaluated in a before-and-after
pilot with a sample of 106 women within refuge (shelter) settings, showing a reduction in par-
ticipants’ psychological distress [17].

 In this paper we report a trial of the PATH intervention in DVA service settings for women
in refuges or community-based programmes, testing its clinical effectiveness in terms of men-
tal health outcomes.
Methods
Ethics and governance
The PATH trial was approved by the South West 4 (Southmead) Research Ethics Committee,
part of the National Research Ethics Service, and site-specific approvals were received from
that committee and the South Wales Research Ethics Committee. The conduct of the trial was
overseen by an independent Trial Steering Committee (TSC), and an independent Data Moni-
toring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) that reviewed safety and outcome data throughout the
trial. Trial Registration: ISRCTN58561170 (http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN58561170). The
application for trial registration was submitted to ISRCTN registry on 23.02.2011. Registration
was delayed because ISRCTN suggested a fee waiver for National Institute for Health Research
funded studies that are adopted into the NIHR portfolio. The adoption process was unexpect-
edly lengthy and delayed the finalisation of ISRCTN registration, confirmed on 26 July 2011.
Study design and participants
This is an open, pragmatic or effectiveness (conducted in “real world” circumstances), two par-
allel group individually randomized controlled trial. The research team, including the statisti-
cians who analysed the outcomes (GFer and TJP), were blind to group assignment. Group
assignment was kept in a randomisation database, separate from the analysis database. The
randomisation database was only accessible to the trial data manager. The trial manager gener-
ated and shared proxy participant IDs and group labels for analysis, and only revealed IDs and
random assignment following completion of the analysis, during a meeting between research-
ers and DVA agencies when results were first announced. Women seeking help from specialist
DVA agencies were randomized with a 1:1 ratio to usual DVA agency support (advocacy
alone) or usual DVA agency support plus a psychological intervention from an advocate or
support worker with additional training: a specialist psychological advocate (SPA). Partici-
pants were enrolled in the study for one year, during which time they had access to usual sup-
port from the DVA agency. Eligible participants were women aged 16 years or older
experiencing DVA which had led them to seek help from one of the recruiting sites. Exclusion
criteria: having a psychotic illness, severe drug or alcohol problem; being unable to read
English; currently attending counselling, cognitive behaviour therapy or other psychological
treatments.
Recruitment took place at two DVA agencies in England and Wales, respectively: Bristol
Next Link (http://www.nextlinkhousing.co.uk/) and Cardiff Women’s Aid (http://www.
cardiffwomensaid.org.uk/). All women who presented to these agencies were assessed for eligi-
bility by the intake worker and invited to consider participation. A woman potentially inter-
ested in participating was referred to a researcher who met with her at a safe location.
Informed consent was obtained from the woman in writing if she agreed to participate. After
consenting her to the study, the researcher and participant agreed an individualised contact
sheet with safety information and details of locators: friends, family or associates who would
be able to help the researcher contact the woman. The participant was then asked to complete
a booklet of baseline questions. On completion, the participant was randomized to either
receiving the PATH intervention or to the control group through a remote independent auto-
mated telephone randomisation service provided by the Bristol Randomised Trials Collabora-
tion (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/social-community-medicine/centres/brtc/). Randomisation was

 stratified by urban area and whether women received support from the refuge/safe house or
community based teams in the agencies. Allocation was concealed from the researcher until
the moment of randomisation.
Over the course of the study women were asked to self-complete three further question-
naire booklets four, eight and twelve months post-randomisation. Questionnaires were either
hand-delivered or sent in the post. Participants were given shopping vouchers for question-
naire completion. Researchers made contact with participants at two, six and ten months post-
randomization. Women were reminded either by text, telephone, or post to return question-
naires at two, four and six weeks after questionnaire postal dispatch or hand-delivery. If
researchers failed to contact a woman on four consecutive occasions, or the questionnaire was
not returned by week seven, the researcher used the women’s locator contacts. Researchers
continued to prompt women (or their locators) for the return of questionnaire until week
twelve, after which the questionnaire was classified as missing. We issued the next question-
naire in the series even when the previous questionnaire(s) was not returned. Returned ques-
tionnaires were checked for completeness and entered into the database.
Intervention and comparator
Specialist psychological advocacy (SPA). Specialist psychological advocates (SPAs)
received a 25-day manualised training programme (available from authors) developed by
Agnew-Davies. The training addressed the psychological impacts of DVA on women and
developed therapeutic skills specifically tailored for this client group. SPAs were trained
to work with common presenting problems within a single session model [18], using a
session structure based on the work of Daldrup and colleagues [19]. Topics included post-
traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, unresolved anger and managing
loss. SPAs were also provided with handouts and self-help resources that could be used
with their clients. Supervision was provided by Agnew-Davies, who listened to a sample of
recorded SPA sessions and provided feedback through regular telephone or email contact
and monthly face-to-face meetings. Participants in the intervention arm were assigned a
SPA with the aim of receiving eight 1:1 SPA sessions (of one hour duration) that alter-
nated with regular advocacy sessions, meeting either weekly or fortnightly with a further
two ‘booster’ sessions, one and three months later. During SPA sessions the advocates
used a variety of primarily cognitive behavioural psychological techniques focusing within
any one session on a specific presenting problem, such as hyper-arousal, sleep difficulties
or parenting problems. The SPA aimed to empower the participant to apply therapeutic
strategies such as relaxation, challenging thoughts or goal setting, to promote recovery
from each problem. In addition to the SPA sessions, women in the intervention group
received usual care from their advocate.
Usual care.
Participants in the advocacy alone group had access to the usual DVA
agency support and advocacy, including safety planning, assistance with health and social
issues housing problems, budgeting and debt, and legal proceedings. They did not receive
SPA sessions and their advocate did not receive specialist training in psychological meth-
ods. The length of time a woman was engaged with a DVA agency varied depending on
their needs and the service’s policies. The intensity and duration of advocacy support
varied.
Primary outcomes
Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation–Outcome Measure [20] (CORE-OM): 34 questions
measuring global psychological distress, with sensitivity to change, good test-retest reliability

 and UK normative data. It was designed to assess efficacy and effectiveness across multiple dis-
ciplines offering psychological therapies [21]. We used it as a continuous measure (mean
score) and as a dichotomous measure (clinical cut-off score � 9.9) [22].
Patient Health Questionnaire [23](PHQ-9): nine question measuring symptoms of depres-
sion, with sensitivity to change and extensive validation in diverse populations. We used it as a
continuous measure (mean score) and as a dichotomous measure (clinical cut-off score � 10
consistent with major depression) [24]. The decision on 11 March 2011 to promote this mea-
sure from a secondary to a primary outcome was taken on the recommendation of our TSC
and DMEC, and was implemented before the first patient was recruited.
Secondary outcomes
Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire [25] (GAD7): seven questions measuring symp-
toms of anxiety, with sensitivity to change, and a score � 10 consistent with a clinical diagnosis
of generalised anxiety disorder [26].
PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) [27] 17 questions measuring post-traumatic stress symptoms
with a score �17 consistent with a clinical diagnosis of PTSD [28].
Short form-12 [29] (SF-12): 12 item acute form quality of life measure with physical and
mental health subscales. Higher SF-12 scores correspond to better health states.
Composite Abuse Scale [30](CAS): 30 questions measuring recent emotional, physical, and
severe abuse, as well as harassment, with good sensitivity to change and robust psychometric
properties, with increased use in DVA trials [31–33]. We used the CAS to measure both IPV
and non-IPV DVA. For this analysis, if a participant was exposed to both types of DVA, we
used the larger item score in calculating the total CAS score at each time point.
All primary and secondary outcomes were measured at 4, 8 and 12 months. Data from the
PHQ-9 and CORE-OM at 4 and 8 months were treated as secondary outcomes and used for
imputation in the absence of the relevant 12 month outcome, because they are clearly corre-
lated with it. We assessed how much contact participants in both intervention and control
groups had with their advocate (SPA or non-SPA).
Serious adverse events
This information was collected and recorded by self-report from the participant, either ver-
bally or in the questionnaire booklet, or elicited by the DVA advocate or SPA following contact
with the participant. All serious adverse events were reported to the data monitoring and ethics
committee (protocol available from authors).
Sample size
An effect size of 0.4 to 0.5 is consistent with those detected in studies of psychological interven-
tions using the CORE-OM as an outcome measure [34] and is consistent with findings for
CBT interventions on PHQ-9 and other measures of depression [35]. Two hundred partici-
pants gives a power of 96% to detect a difference of 0.5 on the CORE-OM (a “reliable change
index” [36]), corresponding to an effect size of 0.5, and 81% power to detect an effect size of
0.4. Assuming an attrition of 20%, we aimed to recruit 250 women.
Statistical analysis
As specified in advance for the primary analyses at 12 months, we analysed groups as rando-
mised, conducting linear regression analyses for continuous, and logistic regression analyses
for binary outcomes. These models were used for primary and secondary outcomes at 12

 months from randomisation (labelled intention-to-treat, or ITT, here). We adjusted for site
(Bristol or Cardiff) and setting (safe house/shelter or community). We did not need to adjust
for imbalance in baseline scores of the characteristics of the groups. We adjusted for baseline
values of the outcome variables to increase the precision of our estimates. We conducted our
pre-specified subgroup analyses by site, setting and age [37], by introducing the relevant inter-
action effect in our regressions models [38]. As specified in our protocol [37], we investigated
whether including participants lost to follow up alters our estimates of effectiveness in sensitiv-
ity analyses based on multiple imputation by chained equation models (mice) for the main
model [39]. We generated 100 imputed datasets using a mice model with all outcome variables
at all time-points, in addition to the variables included in the model for the main analysis
(treatment arm plus stratification by urban area and setting). We did not include socio-demo-
graphic variables in the mice model, because they did not predict missingness for individual
variables. We calculated complier-average causal effects (CACE) using instrumental variables
regression techniques to explore a causal link between assignment to treatment and impact in
relation to treatment adherence (number of treatment sessions received) [40], using a mini-
mum of four sessions. This analysis was specified in our protocol [37]. It supersedes the gener-
alised mixed model with number of sessions as a fixed categorical effect specified in the
protocol as a secondary analysis to assess stability of treatment effect [37], because an instru-
mental variables-based CACE is better placed to both address and account for the issue of
treatment non-adherence [41] (see S1 Text for further details).
We assessed fidelity of the intervention by listening to a stratified random sample of audio-
files. A fidelity scale (available from the authors) was developed to measure adherence of SPAs
to the PATH model. The scale was adapted from a revised version of the Cognitive Therapy
Scale (CTS-R) [42], a widely used measure of competence in CBT, and was used to rate the
content of the audiotapes.
We have published details of the trial design [37]. The cost-effectiveness analysis will be
reported in a separate paper.
Funding and conflict of interest
This paper presents independent research funded by the United Kingdom National Institute
for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research scheme
(RP-PG-0108-10084). The views expressed in this publication are those of the authors and not
necessarily those of the National Health Service, the NIHR, or the Department of Health. The
funder had no involvement in study design, conduct or analysis. If the PATH intervention was
implemented in service settings, Agnew-Davies would receive payment for training and super-
vising SPAs. The other authors declare no conflicts of interest.
Results
We report on the analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes at the primary follow up
point of 12 months, between the two groups of women as randomised (ITT).
Trial flow and baseline characteristics
Between April 2011 and May 2013 we obtained consent and randomized 263 participants:
24% of eligible women seeking help from the two participating DVA agencies (1096), 51% of
women who consented to be contacted by a researcher (513), and 83% of women who met
with a researcher to discuss participation (317). 64% of participants were retained for the full
12 month follow up period to the end of the trial, although we had primary outcome data from
any follow up time point available for 78% of participants (78% SPA group, 77% advocacy

 alone group). In some cases, it was impossible to establish the reason for loss to follow up, as
women had also lost contact with the collaborating agencies (Fig 1). The vulnerability and
mobility of women experiencing DVA makes follow up in longitudinal studies challenging
[43, 44].
Women lost to follow up were more likely to have been in refuges: 42% lost to follow up,
versus 23% lost to follow up among women who were not in a refuge. This would be expected,
because women who leave their home for a refuge are more likely to subsequently leave the
local area. However, all other socio-demographic characteristics and outcomes did not differ
between women lost to follow up and women who remained in the study (S1 Table). In addi-
tion, in terms of socio-demographic characteristics or outcomes, women lost to follow up in
the control group (N = 43) were comparable to women lost to follow up in the intervention
group (N = 47).
The SPA group and advocacy alone group had similar characteristics at baseline (Tables 1
and 2, with more details available elsewhere[45]).
Of the 120/130 participants in the SPA group for whom we have information on adherence,
54 (45%) attended fewer than four sessions, and 66 (55%) attended four or more, which we
pre-specified as reflecting adequate adherence. Implementation partners also shared records

 of participants’ attendance at advocacy sessions for all participants. These data show that the
average number of advocacy sessions was 5.8 (SD 6.6) for control group participants
(N = 124), and 7.2 (SD 6.8) for SPA clients (N = 95).
Fig 2 illustrates the flow of women through the intervention. More than half of the 120 for
whom we have attendance records attended four or more of the sessions. One third attended
all eight sessions. Thirty-five women also attended the first booster session, and 26 attended
both booster sessions.
Primary outcomes
Table 2 shows a 3.3 point lower mean CORE-OM score and a 2.2 point lower mean PHQ-9
score between the SPA and the advocacy group at 12 months’ follow up. 35% of the SPA group
and 55% of the advocacy alone group were above the clinical threshold for the CORE-OM at
12 months respectively (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.2 to 0.6), with proportions
at baseline of 78% and 74% respectively. 29% of the SPA group and 46% of the advocacy alone
group were above the clinical threshold for the PHQ-9 at 12 months respectively (odds ratio
0.4, 95% confidence interval 0.2 to 0.8). Trends in the CORE-OM and PHQ-9 score over the
12-month period post randomisation suggest that the intervention group experiences a
sharper improvement in mental health four months post recruitment, compared with the con-
trol group. Both groups remain stable around the initial reductions over the intervening eight
months, suggesting that intervention participants sustain the relative improvement (S1 Fig).
Secondary outcomes
The PTSD score is lower in the SPA than in the advocacy alone group after 12 months and the
proportion of women below the clinical threshold for PTSD is also lower in the SPA group.

 However, there was no evidence of a difference in GAD-7 score nor the proportion of women
below the clinical threshold (Table 3). The SF-12 mental health score is higher in the SPA
group, and there is no evidence for a difference in the SF-12 physical health score. There is no
evidence of a difference in total exposure to further abuse.
Pre-specified secondary analyses
For primary and secondary outcomes, the multiple imputation for missing data gave lower

 within the 95% confidence intervals of the complete case analysis (S2 Table). The imputations
for binary outcomes yielded very similar odds ratios to the complete case analysis (S2 Table).
The CACE analysis results in roughly a doubling of the effect of the intervention across mental
health and abuse variables, consistent with greater benefit for those participants attending a
sufficient number of SPA sessions (S2 Table).
The fidelity analysis (details available from the authors) shows that SPAs broadly adhered
to the session structure and the working alliance with participants, as specified in the PATH
manual and training.
The subgroup analyses found no evidence of interaction effects between treatment and age,
site and setting (S3 Table).
Serious adverse events
22 women (15 in the SPA group, seven in the advocacy alone group) reported a total of 32 seri-
ous adverse events (Table 4). For three women (four events) in the intervention group, it was
unclear from the information available whether the SAEs were related to trial participation.
These events were reported to the NHS research ethic committee (REC) that had approved the
study, following advice from the chair of our study’s independent Data Monitoring & Ethics
Committee. The REC judged that nochanges to the conduct of the intervention or trial were
necessary. None of the remaining 28 SAEs (19 women) were related to trial participation.
Most of the serious adverse events were hospital admission due to physical or mental ill health.
This included six cases of attempted suicide, seven cases related to pregnancy or miscarriage,
three cases of injuries from physical assault, ten cases of chest or abdominal pain and two
planned admissions. Planned admissions and injuries from physical assault were only found in
the intervention arm. All other non-miscellaneous categories occurred with a similar fre-
quency in both arms.
Conclusions
This study is the first randomized controlled trial of an intervention to improve mental health
symptoms of women experiencing DVA delivered by advocates with additional training in
psychological methods. The PATH intervention, unlike the majority of psychological treat-
ments for survivors of DVA, which are delivered by psychologists or counsellors, is based on a
relatively brief training of advocates already in the DVA sector with ongoing supervision by a
psychologist.

 We found that the primary outcomes of psychological distress and symptoms of depression
were reduced in both arms compared to baseline, with evidence of a difference between the
groups at 12 months follow up. This was also the case for post-traumatic stress symptoms and
a general measure of mental health state (SF-12mental), but not anxiety or experience of fur-
ther abuse.
Although the differences in mean scores for the primary outcomes between the groups are
relatively modest, there are clinically important differences in the primary outcomes expressed
as proportions of participants in the intervention and control groups with depression and with
psychological distress. The treatment effect is reduced with imputation for missing data and
increased in those participants attending more SPA sessions. A judgement about whether the
extent of benefit justifies implementation of the PATH intervention needs to take into account
the findings of the nested qualitative study, reported in the accompanying qualitative paper
(see Evans et al., DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193077), that explores the experiences of
participants.
The four SAEs in which the relation to trial participation was uncertain occurred in the
control group. The greater number of SAEs over all recorded in the intervention group was
probably due to greater contact with DVA advocates.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of PATH include: recruitment of a sizeable proportion of the eligible women
experiencing abuse and seeking help [46]; successful collaboration with agencies in the DVA
sector to deliver a psychological intervention with reasonable fidelity; relatively complete data
collection from participants retained in the trial; outcome data from at least one time point
after randomisation from 74% of participants; and a nested longitudinal qualitative study (see
Evans et al., DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193077). The main limitation threatening the internal
validity of the trial is the 34% loss of participants 12 months post-intervention, requiring pre-
specified imputation of the missing outcome data. The main limitation threatening its external
validity is the proportion of eligible women who did not participate, including those who
wanted counselling and potentially most likely to respond to the intervention. Finally, this was
a “real world” pragmatic trial, where intervention participants had higher levels of contact
with services because they accessed SPA treatment in addition to usual care. The absence of an
attention control group means we cannot exclude the possibility that the additional contact
was responsible for the treatment effect. However, our IV results in conjunction with advo-
cates’ adherence to the treatment model (see fidelity analysis) provides support for the hypoth-
esis that the increased effectiveness deriving from attendance may be explained by the
treatment, rather than more exposure to advocates.
Comparison with other studies
The standardised effect size of the SPA intervention (0.4 for CORE-OM and 0.32 for PHQ-9)
is similar to the effect of psychological treatment for depression in primary care [47]. The effect
on mental health outcomes is comparable to other trials of psychological interventions for sur-
vivors of DVA measuring treatment impact on trauma-related mental health symptoms or
wellbeing, as systematically reviewed by Warshaw and colleagues [48]. Five of the nine studies
in that review were CBT-based interventions for women who were experiencing IPV and
three were targeted at women with additional conditions: suicidality, substance abuse or preg-
nancy. All the interventions were delivered by trained therapists, whereas the PATH interven-
tion was delivered by domestic violence advocates with relatively brief training, but ongoing
supervision.

 Implications of findings
The PATH intervention delivered by specialist psychological advocates can improve psycho-
logical distress and depressive symptoms in women survivors of DVA, the majority of whom
had experienced IPV. The findings of the trial and of the nested qualitative study (see Evans
et al., DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193077) show heterogeneity in response to the intervention;
further abuse, experienced by a large minority of participants, possibly attenuated its effect.
These findings from a pragmatic trial can be implemented in DVA agency settings that already
employ advocates, if they undergo further training.
