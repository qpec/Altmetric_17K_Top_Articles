Abstract
Background: Cognitive training is effective in patients with mild cognitive impairment but does not typically address the 
motivational deficits associated with older populations with memory difficulties.
Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of cognitive training using a novel memory game on an iPad in 42 
patients with a diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment assigned to either the cognitive training (n 
= 
21; 8 hours of 
gameplay over 4 weeks) or control (n 
= 
21; clinic visits as usual) groups.
Results: Significant time-by-pattern-by-group interactions were found for cognitive performance in terms of the number of errors 
made and trials needed on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Paired Associates Learning task (P 
= 
.044; 
P 
= 
.027). Significant time-by-group interactions were also found for the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery 
Paired Associates Learning first trial memory score (P 
= 
.002), Mini-Mental State Examination (P 
= 
.036), the Brief Visuospatial 
Memory Test (P 
= 
.032), and the Apathy Evaluation Scale (P 
= 
.026). Within-group comparisons revealed highly specific effects of 
cognitive training on episodic memory. The cognitive training group maintained high levels of enjoyment and motivation to 
continue after each hour of gameplay, with self-confidence and self-rated memory ability improving over time.
Conclusions: Episodic memory robustly improved in the cognitive training group. “Gamified” cognitive training may also 
enhance visuospatial abilities in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Gamification maximizes engagement with 
cognitive training by increasing motivation and could complement pharmacological treatments for amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment and mild Alzheimer’s disease. Larger, more controlled trials are needed to replicate and extend these findings.

Introduction
The number of people with dementia is 47.5 million world-
wide, with 7.7 million new cases every year (World Health 
Organization, 2016). As innovations in the field of public 
health have lengthened the average human lifespan consid-
erably, effective treatments for reducing cognitive decline in 
the aging population are needed. Cholinesterase inhibitors, 
including donepezil and rivastigmine, show modest time-
limited benefits for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
but are more likely to be effective for the treatment of atten-
tional dysfunction (Eagger et al., 1992; Sahakian et al., 1993). 
Since 2003, no additional treatments have been approved for 
AD, thus emphasizing the need for new interventions early in 
the course of the neurodegenerative process (Barnett et al., 
2016). As such, alternative nonpharmacological strategies for 
memory restoration and enhancement are now being devel-
oped (Sahakian et al., 2015; Brühl and Sahakian, 2016; Savulich 
et al., 2017).
Individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
(aMCI), often the prodromal stage of AD, report mild short-
term memory difficulties but preserved independence in 
activities of daily living (Albert et al., 2011). Individuals with 
multiple domain MCI can also show subtle decline across a 
range of other cognitive processes including language, atten-
tion, executive functions, problem solving, processing speed, 
and visuospatial abilities (Petersen, 2011). The prevalence of 
MCI is estimated to be around 3% to 20% of individuals above 
the age of 65, and at least 10% to 15% of these individuals pro-
gress to AD annually (DeCarli, 2003). A significant proportion 
of individuals with MCI also experience comorbid neuropsy-
chiatric symptoms, such as apathy, anxiety, and depression, 
which negatively impact treatment entry and engagement and 
significantly predict conversion to AD (Monastero et al., 2009).
There are currently no approved drugs by the US Food and 
Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, or Medicines 
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for the treatment 
of cognitive dysfunction, including memory impairment, in 
individuals with MCI. Previous clinical trials have failed to 
show any pharmacological intervention that slows progres-
sion of MCI to AD (e.g., Petersen et al., 2005; Feldman et al., 
2007; Winblad et al., 2008). Cognitive remediation strategies, 
including cognitive training, are now used to enhance mem-
ory in neuropsychiatric disorders, with positive effects found 
in patients with schizophrenia (Wykes et al., 2011). Cognitive 
training is also effective in MCI (for reviews, see Belleville, 
2008; Jean et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2011; Gates et al., 2011; 
Reijnders et al., 2013). Specifically, individuals with MCI receive 
mild-to-moderate benefits in episodic, semantic, and working 
memory, as well as in language, attention/processing speed, 
self-rated anxiety/depression, visuospatial abilities, functional 
abilities, activities of daily living, and quality of life (Li et al., 
2011). Cognitive training of memory has also been shown to 
increase activation and connectivity in widespread frontal, 
temporal, and occipital regions of the brain (Sanz Simon et al., 
2012; Strenziok et al., 2014), including the hippocampus (Rosen 
et al., 2011; Kirchoff et al., 2012), in healthy older adults and in 
patients with MCI.
Despite the advantages of cognitive training, one major chal-
lenge is overcoming the high incidence of dropout rates typical 
of patient groups. The cost and inconvenience of delivery (e.g., 
use of specialized equipment, participant travel), in addition to 
apathetic or depressive symptoms often characteristic of older 
populations with memory difficulties, leads to considerable 
dropout rates. Engagement with cognitive training programs 
may therefore require a more motivational approach by increas-
ing task-related enjoyment.
Computer games are highly rewarding and can deliver tar-
geted cognitive training programs that also have the poten-
tial to improve motivational deficits found in patient groups 
with severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (Savulich et al., 2017). 
Previously, video game training has shown to enhance sus-
tained attention and working memory in older adults aged 
60 to 85, with gains persisting up to 6 months and similar 
to those observed in untrained 20-year-olds (Anguera et al., 
2013). We recently demonstrated that 8 hours of playing 
“Wizard” (www.peak.net/advanced-training), a memory game 
designed for patients with schizophrenia, improved episodic 
memory and functional outcome compared with a treatment-
as-usual group (Sahakian et al., 2015). Importantly, those 
that played our game reported high levels of enjoyment and 
desire to continue after each hour of gameplay, which likely 
represents a motivational improvement over traditional (usu-
ally boring) cognitive training programs. Gamified cognitive 
training can simultaneously improve cognition and motiva-
tion, and thus comprises an appealing option for disorders in 
which pharmacological treatments have failed to treat cog-
nitive dysfunction or do not address the associated motiva-
tional deficits.
The present study aimed to test the effects of “Game Show,” 
a novel learning and memory game, on cognition and motiva-
tion in patients with aMCI. We hypothesized that patients in the 
cognitive training group (8 hours of supervised gameplay on an 
iPad over the course of 4 weeks) would demonstrate improved 
episodic memory, our key trained domain, and visuospatial 
abilities, a secondary measure of near transfer, compared with 
patients in a control group (clinic visits as usual). We further 
hypothesized that the cognitive training group would maintain 
high levels of self-reported enjoyment and motivation through-
out all hours of gameplay.
Significance Statement
Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has been described as the transitional stage between healthy ageing and dementia. 
aMCI is characterized by day-to-day memory difficulties and motivational problems. At present, there are no effective pharma-
cological treatments for the cognitive impairments of patients with aMCI. Cognitive training has shown benefits, but training 
packages are typically repetitive and boring. To maximize engagement with training, we developed a novel memory game in col-
laboration with patients with aMCI and tested its effects on cognition and motivation. We found that patients who played “Game 
Show” on an iPad for 8 hours over the course of 4 weeks showed improved episodic memory (memories of locations and events) 
compared with patients who attended clinic as usual. High levels of enjoyment and motivation were also maintained throughout 
all hours of gameplay. “Gamified” cognitive training can thus be used to enhance memory and motivation in patients with aMCI.

Methods
Participants
Forty-two patients were recruited from the Dementias 
and Neurodegeneration NIHR Clinical Research Network 
(Eastern DeNDRon) and memory clinics at the Cambridge and 
Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge University 
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and Norfolk and Suffolk NHS 
Foundation Trust. All patients had MCI by NIA 
AA core clinical 
criteria for MCI of the AD type (Albert et al., 2011), as confirmed 
by their referring clinician prior to study enrollment. Exclusion 
criteria were a current or past neurological disorder or a current 
neuropsychiatric disorder affecting memory. Only adults aged 
45 years and older with normal to corrected vision were invited 
to participate. All participants gave written informed consent.
Neuropsychological Assessment
The National Adult Reading Test (Nelson, 1982) is a widely used 
estimate of premorbid intelligence (full-scale IQ range 69–131).
Neuropsychiatric Symptoms
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS Short Form)
The GDS (Sheikh and Yesavage, 1986) is a 15-item measure of 
depression in the elderly. Participants answer yes/no questions, 
with a score ≧5 suggestive of depression and a ≧10 almost always 
indicative of depression (range 0–15).
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
The HADS (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) is a 14-item measure of 
anxiety and depression. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with 
a higher total score indicating a higher level of anxiety and 
depression.
Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES)
The AES (Marin, 1996) is an 18-item measure of apathy. 
Participants are instructed to indicate how true each statement 
is of them in the past couple of weeks (from 0 = not at all to 
3 = very). Higher scores indicate greater levels of apathy, with 
a score of 43 or greater usually indicating clinically significant 
apathy (range 0–54).
Cognitive Measures
CANTAB Paired Associates Learning
The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Paired 
Associates Learning (CANTAB PAL) assesses episodic memory and 
new learning and is a commonly used and highly sensitive test 
for MCI and early AD (Sahakian et al., 1988; Swainson et al., 2001; 
Blackwell et al., 2004; Barnett et al., 2016). Using a touch-sensitive 
computer screen, boxes are displayed and opened in a randomized 
order. One or more of them will contain a pattern. The patterns are 
then displayed in the middle of the screen, one at a time, and the 
participant must touch the box where they think the pattern was 
originally located. If the participant makes an error, then the pat-
terns are re-presented to remind the participant of their locations. 
The level of difficulty increases throughout the task, with 1-, 2-, 3-, 
6-, and 8-pattern stages. In line with previous studies (e.g., Sahakian 
et al., 1988, 2015; Kaser et al., 2016), outcome measures include total 
errors adjusted, total trials adjusted, and first trial memory score 
(i.e., the number of patterns correctly located after the first trial 
summed across the number of stages completed).
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
The MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) is a 30-point measure of cogni-
tive impairment that is commonly used to screen for dementia. 
Possible points for each category of assessment are as follows: 
orientation to time (5), orientation to place (5), registration (3), 
attention and calculation (5), recall (3), language (2), repetition 
(1), and complex commands (6). Scores indicate severe (<10), 
moderate (10–17), or mild (18–23) dementia.
Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised
The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) (Benedict, 
1997) is a measure of visuospatial memory. In the learning trial, 
participants view a stimulus page of 6 geometric figures for 10 
seconds and are asked to draw as many of the figures as pos-
sible, without looking, in their correct location. Participants are 
given 3 opportunities to do this. A delayed recall trial is then 
administered after 25 minutes. Participants are then asked to 
identify in a forced choice recognition trial which of 12 figures 
were included among the original geometric figures (indicat-
ing yes/no responses). Finally, a copy trial is administered to 
screen for severe visuoconstructive deficits and to help score 
recall responses. Task versions were counterbalanced across 
testing sessions. A maximum of 12 points can be awarded for 
each trial based on the accuracy and location of the drawings. 
Measures of total recall (Trial 1 + Trial 2 + Trial 3 raw scores; 
range 0–36, higher scores indicating better visuospatial learning 
and memory), learning ([higher of trial 2 or trial 3] – trial 1 raw 
scores; range 0–12, higher scores reflecting more learning over 
successive presentation trials), delayed recall (range 0–12, higher 
scores indicating better recent, long-term visuospatial memory), 
and percentage retained ([delayed recall/(higher of trial 2 and 3)] 
x 100; range 0–100, higher scores indicating more information 
originally learned that was retained across the delay interval) 
are calculated.
CANTAB Choice Reaction Time (CRT)
The CANTAB CRT assesses the participant’s ability to react as 
quickly as possible to basic stimuli. It is used to assess motor 
speed and thus acts as a control measure of general alertness 
to help interpret other cognitive tasks. An arrow will appear on 
either the left or right side of a computer screen. After the arrow 
appears, the participant is instructed to press a corresponding 
left or right button, using a response box, as quickly as possible.
Game Show
Game Show was developed in collaboration between healthy 
older adults, patients with aMCI, a cognitive experimental 
psychologist, and a professional games developer. Our target 
cognitive process for improvement was episodic memory. This 
was decided from previous studies in our laboratory showing 
neuropsychological evidence of impaired memory performance 
(Swainson et al., 2001; Blackwell et al., 2004) and neuroimaging 
evidence of hippocampal dysfunction (de Rover et al., 2011) dur-
ing the CANTAB PAL task in patients with MCI.
Game Show was designed using visually appealing displays 
and stimulating music. Pilot data was collected from 16 individu-
als (12 healthy elderly individuals and 5 patients with aMCI) to 
ensure that our game was fun, motivational, easy to understand, 
and in line with a concept suitable for an older adult population 
(i.e., daytime television game shows). Individuals played Game 
Show on an iPad for up to 1 hour and provided feedback on their 
experience, with suggestions for improvement. High levels of 
enjoyment and motivation were prioritized during development, 
as these properties were the key advantages of our game over

other cognitive training programs. Pilot data from patients with 
aMCI indicated that the final version of our game was highly 
enjoyable (M = 9.32, SD = .66) and motivational (M = 9.40, SD = .58) 
(rated using 10-cm visual analogue scales, with higher scores 
indicated greater experience of enjoyment and motivation).
Procedure
This study received full ethical approval from the National 
Research Committee East of England-Norfolk (13/EE/0290). The 
study comprised a 2-group, randomized controlled design (see 
Figure 1 for a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials flow dia-
gram depicting the passage of patients through the randomized 
controlled trial; Moher et al., 2001). Invited patients were ran-
domly assigned to either the cognitive training or control group.
Participants attended a baseline testing session in which 
they provided basic demographic information and were asked 
about their technology use, including the amount of time spent 
each week browsing the Internet and/or playing computer 
games and their confidence using new technological devices. 
Participants were also asked if they were currently playing any 
cognitive training games or applications. Participants were 
asked to complete computerized and pen-and-paper assess-
ments of cognition and questionnaire assessments of neuropsy-
chiatric symptoms.
Participants in the cognitive training group were invited to 
attend eight 1-hour sessions of supervised cognitive training 
(i.e., play Game Show on an iPad). During cognitive training, 
the player takes part in Game Show to win gold coins. In each 
round, the player is challenged to associate different geometric 
patterns with different spatial locations. Each correct answer 
allows the player to earn more coins. Rounds continue until 
completion or after 6 attempts are made. The number of geo-
metric patterns presented is titrated depending on the player’s 
performance to keep users motivated and engaged. A “host” 
encourages the player to maintain and progress beyond their 
last played level. After each hour of gameplay, participants rate 
their experience in terms of enjoyment, desire to continue, level 
of self-confidence, and self-rated memory ability using 10-cm 
VAS. Participants in the control group were not given access to 
Game Show and attended clinic as usual.
At a maximum of 4 weeks after the baseline testing session, all 
participants completed an outcome testing session, which was iden-
tical to the baseline testing session in terms of outcome measures.
Statistical Analyses
Demographic and baseline questionnaire measures were ana-
lyzed using independent samples t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests 
for continuous variables and chi-square for categorical variables. 
Cognitive and questionnaire measures (dependent variables com-
bined) were first measured at baseline and outcome separately 
using multivariate ANOVA to reduce the probability of making a 
T
ype 1 error. Posthoc repeated-measures ANOVAs were then per-
formed on each dependent variable, with time (baseline, outcome) 
as the within-subjects factor and group (cognitive training, control) 
as the between-subjects factor. Total PAL errors and trials were 
analyzed with an additional within-subjects factor of pattern (1-, 
2-, 3-, 6-, and 8-patterns) to determine the effects of gameplay at 
different levels of task difficulty. Independent samples t tests were 
used to interpret significant interactions by determining differ-
ences between groups for each measure at baseline and outcome. 
Paired samples t tests were also used in each group separately to 
isolate the effects of cognitive training from baseline to outcome.

premorbid intelligence, years in education, technology use 
(Internet and game playing), and confidence using new tech-
nological devices (all P 
> 
.42). The 2 groups also did not differ in 
baseline global cognition, depression, and apathy (all P 
> 
.31) and 
scored within the nondementing range of the MMSE (Table 1). 
No participants were currently playing any cognitive training 
games or applications.
Multivariate ANOVA
There was a significant difference in dependent variables (PAL 
total errors adjusted, PAL total trials adjusted, PAL first trial 
memory score, MMSE score, GDS score, AES score, BVMT-R total 
recall, BVMT-R learning, BVMT-R delayed recall, and BVMT-R 
percentage of information retained) at the group level at out-

was no significant multivariate effect at the group level at base-

CANTAB PAL
Errors. The time-by-pattern-by-group interaction for total 
errors adjusted was significant [F(4,37) = 2.72, P = .044, ηp
2 = .23] 
with main effects of time [F(1,40) = 5.77, P = .021, ηp
2 = .13] and 
pattern [F(4,37) = 25.83, P < .001, ηp
2 = .74] (Figure 2). Follow-up 
independent samples t tests showed that the cognitive train-
ing group made significantly fewer errors at the second- and 
third-pattern stages compared with the control group at 
outcome [t(21.68) = -2.40, P = .025, d = .13 and t(24.87) = -2.07, 
P = .049, d = .64, respectively] (Table 2). The number of errors 
made between groups at the 6-pattern stage at outcome did 
not reach significance [t(40) = -1.86, P = .071]. Paired samples t 
tests showed that the number of errors made from baseline to 
outcome was significantly reduced at the second [t(20) = 3.13, 
P = .005] and third [t(20) = 2.28, P = .034] pattern stages in the cog-
nitive training group, but not the control group (P > .24). Total 
errors were also significantly reduced within the cognitive 
training group [t(20) = 3.20, P = .005], but not the control group 
[t(20) = -.17, P = .86].
Trials. The time-by-pattern-by-group interaction for total tri-
als adjusted was significant [F(4,37) 
= 
3.08, P 
=

main effects of time [F(1.40)

[F(4,37) 
= 47.00, P 
< 
.001, ηp
2 
= 
.84] (Figure 2). A follow-up independ-
ent samples t-test showed that the Cognitive Training group 
needed significantly fewer trials at the second-pattern stage 
compared with the control group at outcome [t(21.34) 
= 
-2.34, 
P 
= 
.024, d 
= 
.63] (Table 2). The difference in means for the num-
ber of trials needed between groups at the third-pattern stage at 
outcome did not reach significance [t(40) 
= 
-1.99, P 
= 
.054]. Paired 
samples t tests showed that the number of trials needed from 
baseline to outcome was significantly reduced at the second 
[t(20) 
= 
3.23, P 
= 
.004] and third [t(20) 
= 
2.44, P 
= 
.024] pattern stages 
in the cognitive training group, but not the control group (P 
> 
.92). 
Total trials were also significantly reduced within the cognitive 
training group [t(20) 
= 
3.72, P 
= 
.001] but not the control group 
[t(20) 
= 
-.11, P 
= 
.91]. Due to the potential confounding effects of 
anxiety and depression on memory in individuals with MCI, PAL 
analyses were repeated using baseline HADS score as a covari-
ate. Key Time-by-Pattern-by-Group interactions remained and 
were: errors, F = 2.64, P = .049 and trials, F = 3.15, P = .026.
First Trial Memory Score. The time-by-group interaction for first 
trial memory score was also significant [F(1,40) 
= 
10.56, P 
= 
.002, 
ηp
2 
= 
.21], with a main effect of time [F(1.40) 
= 
9.04, P 
= 
.005, ηp
2 
= 
.18 
(Figure 2). A follow-up independent samples t test showed that 
group means significantly differed at outcome [t(39.96) 
= 
2.62, 
P 
= 
.012, d 
= 
.83] (Table 2). Paired samples t tests showed that first 
trial memory scores were significantly improved from baseline 
to outcome in the cognitive training group [t(20)  
= 
-4.21, P 
< 
.001] 
but not the control group [t(20)=.18, P 
= 
.86].
BVMT-R—The time-by-group interaction for the percent-
age of information retained during the recognition phase of the 
BVMT-R was significant [F(1,37) 
=

SD

VAS after Gameplay—High levels of enjoyment and motiva-
tion were maintained throughout all hours of gameplay (all rat-
ings >.76), whereas self-confidence and self-reported memory 
ability improved over time (range from .48 to .78) (Figure 3). All 
participants in the cognitive training group completed every 
hour of gameplay and no participant withdrew from the study.
Discussion
We tested a novel learning and memory game for use on an iPad 
including its effects on cognition and motivation in patients with 
aMCI. We hypothesized that patients with aMCI would show 
improved episodic memory and visuospatial abilities after 8 hours 
of cognitive training compared with a control group that attended 
clinic as usual. Due to the gamification of our cognitive training 
program, we further hypothesized that high levels of enjoyment 
and motivation would be maintained after each hour of gameplay.
Effects of Cognitive Training on Episodic Memory 
and Visuospatial Abilities
In support of our main hypothesis, cognitive training with 
Game Show led to improvements in episodic memory as 
measured by the CANTAB PAL task. Effect sizes found for total 
errors (23%), total trials (25%), and first trial memory score 
(21%) were modest between groups, but larger than for all 
other outcome measures. Specifically, the cognitive training 
group showed significantly better performance compared with 
the control group in terms of reduced errors and the num-
ber of trials needed for completion. For errors, the cognitive 
training group showed better performance at the second- and 
third-pattern stages. For trials, the cognitive training group 
showed better performance at the second-pattern stage. The 
cognitive training group also correctly remembered the loca-
tions of more patterns after the first trial summed across all 
stages completed (first trial memory score), which was the 
only significant between-group interaction that would survive 
strict correction for multiple comparisons. However, within-
group comparisons revealed highly specific effects of cognitive 
training on episodic memory. Here, patients showed mean-
ingful effects of training at lower loads of PAL task difficulty. 
Improvements at easier pattern stages reflect previous work 
from our laboratory showing that hippocampal activation is 
dependent upon memory load, such that patients with MCI 
activate more at lower loads and less at higher loads compared 
with controls (de Rover et al., 2011). A differential pattern of 
activation suggests that cognitive interventions for hippocam-
pal-dependent memory deficits may be most effective at more 
tractable levels of PAL task difficulty. Furthermore, impaired 
performance on this task is known to be sensitive and spe-
cific for the early and differential diagnosis of AD (Swainson 
et al., 2001; Blackwell et al., 2004), with increased errors asso-
ciated with decreased hippocampal volume (Nathan et al., 
2017). PAL performance is therefore one candidate neuropsy-
chological marker for preclinical AD (Beddington et al., 2008). 
Importantly, our study demonstrates that cognitive training 
robustly improves PAL task performance within patients with 
aMCI, emphasizing that memory deficits are not necessarily

on the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) by group at baseline and outcome. Individuals in the cognitive training group maintained high levels of motivation and enjoyed 
playing the game; self-confidence improved over the course of the cognitive training sessions.

stable and are amenable to change early in the course of the 
neurodegenerative process. These results are also consistent 
with our previous study showing that patients with schizo-
phrenia demonstrate improved episodic memory following 
cognitive training with a memory game on an iPad (Sahakian 
et al., 2015).
Results from the BVMT-R showed that the cognitive training 
group retained significantly more complex geometric informa-
tion at delayed recall compared with the control group at out-
come. This was anticipated, as both our memory game and the 
BVMT-R require participants to memorize different geometric 
patterns in a given spatial location. Data from this task suggests 
important convergent validity that our game produces an effect 
on an independent, but conceptually related, measure of visuos-
patial memory. Although encouraging, this result requires con-
firmation in a larger sample, as improved visuospatial abilities 
within a cognitive training group would substantiate training 
effects with evidence of near transfer.
Effects of Cognitive Training on General Cognition 
and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms
Changes in MMSE scores were unexpected. Scores in both 
groups changed by a difference of more than half a point 
(higher for the cognitive training group, and lower for the con-
trol group) and significantly differed at outcome. However, 
MMSE scores from baseline to outcome were not significantly 
different within either group. Given that our training program 
specifically targeted episodic memory, it is possible that the 
trained cognitive domain would have generalized to improve-
ments at the global level. However, a recent meta-analysis con-
cluded that cognitive stimulation of multiple domains, typically 
including a social component, is the only cognitive interven-
tion that improves general cognition in dementia (Huntley et 
al., 2015). We therefore interpret our significant interaction with 
caution. Execution of our memory game in a group format, or 
introduction of an opponent or companion player option, might 
increase socialization needed to achieve these effects. This 
would be most advantageous if delivered before dementia is 
already diagnosed, as damage to the brain is usually too severe 
for improvements in global outcome measures following cogni-
tive intervention in later stages of disease progression.
Lastly, apathy significantly increased within the control group 
from baseline to outcome. This may be due to indifference associ-
ated with knowledge about participation in the nonintervention 
group. Apathy scores from baseline to outcome did not signifi-
cantly differ within our cognitive training group, but no partici-
pant showed clinically significant apathy at either time point. 
Use of gaming technology to reduce apathetic symptoms, how-
ever, has shown promise. “Serious” gaming, for example, has been 
successfully adapted for use in MCI patients with high levels of 
apathy (Manera et al., 2015). Cognitive stimulating activities have 
also been shown to reduce apathetic and depressive symptoms 
in older adults with memory complaints (Buettner et al., 2011). In 
addition to increasing the motivational aspects of cognitive train-
ing, serious games also have the potential to target impaired emo-
tional and social processes, which would be beneficial for reducing 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with aMCI and AD.
Motivational Enhancement
One of the key aims of our study was to ensure that Game Show 
was developed with patient feedback to be easily understood, 
highly enjoyable, and motivating. Use of an iPad allowed for the 
titration of difficulty depending on individual performance, thus 
taking a more personalized approach to keep users engaged. Our 
game was further designed to have the same motivational prop-
erties typical of computer games, including stimulating music, 
character assistance, opportunities for progression, feedback 
and humor, in an effort to maximize player engagement and cir-
cumvent dropout rates often problematic of cognitive training 
studies (Sahakian et al., 2015). Most cognitive training programs 
are overly repetitive and do not address the motivational defi-
cits associated with older populations with memory difficulties 
(Savulich et al., 2017). We observed that all participants in the 
cognitive training group completed each hour of gameplay and, 
importantly, reported high levels of enjoyment and motivation 
to continue, with self-confidence and self-rated memory ability 
improving over time. The lack of dropout in our study represents 
a motivational improvement over traditional cognitive training 
programs, where the attrition rate can be >15% (Wykes et al., 
2011) and encourages the potential for a wider application of 
serious games for cognitive training in other clinical popula-
tions with severe motivational deficits, such as traumatic brain 
injury or remitted depression.
Limitations
Our study had limitations. Firstly, our sample size was rela-
tively small, with limited statistical power. Secondly, we did not 
include an active control group, such as patients with aMCI play-
ing a nonmemory-related game or a game with no specific cog-
nitive content. Although we cannot preclude the possibility that 
the effects observed here were epiphenomena of touch screen 
technology use more generally, we consider this unlikely as both 
groups reported similar levels of computer gaming, Internet 
use, and confidence using new technology at baseline. It is also 
possible that increased contact time and interaction with the 
research team, particularly with the elderly, positively impacts 
cognitive performance, raises self-esteem, or offers some other 
confounding social benefit not controlled for here. Replication 
and extension with a larger, more controlled trial, including an 
active control group with access to an iPad, but not our mem-
ory game, would address these methodological shortcomings. 
Although not within the scope of the current study, the duration 
to which cognitive improvements persist and their dependence 
on continued gameplay pose important areas of future research.
Strengths
Strengths of our study include in depth public and patient 
involvement during the development of our game, the likeli-
hood that portable devices increase active engagement with 
participation in cognitive training, and the reduction in negative 
stigma since games are popular with healthy people of all ages. 
Gamified cognitive training is also cost effective and not associ-
ated with side effects inevitably reported by patients taking med-
ication. Integrating findings from neuropsychiatry with gaming 
technology could also lead to more widespread use of innova-
tive nonpharmacological strategies for cognitive restoration and 
enhancement and help alter public perception of cognitive inter-
ventions for memory (Sahakian et al., 2015; Savulich et al., 2017).
Conclusions
Overall, the present study demonstrates that episodic memory 
is one cognitive process that can be targeted, with success, for

enhancement by gamified cognitive training in patients with 
aMCI. Importantly, cognitive training with a game effectively 
maintains high levels of participant enjoyment and motivation 
and promotes confidence both in the self and subjective mem-
ory ability. Cognitive training also has the potential to improve 
visuospatial abilities. Early intervention and effective treatment 
is critical for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly before 
extensive neuropathological damage (Beddington et al., 2008; 
Sahakian et al., 2010; Collins et al., 2011). Novel symptomatic 
interventions are urgently needed, and recent interest in non-
pharmacological approaches of enhancement, which utilize 
novel technologies to target cognitive symptoms rather than 
diagnostic category, offer an alternative means for improving 
cognition in the absence of effective drug treatments (Insel and 
Sahakian, 2012; Insel et al., 2013; Sahakian, 2014). Gamified cog-
nitive training strategies could thus be used to ameliorate mem-
ory deficits and increase motivation, either independently or in 
combination with other interventions for the elderly, such as 
physical exercise or pharmacological treatments, to synergize 
the effects needed for good cognitive outcome for patients with 
aMCI and mild AD. Larger, more controlled trials are required to 
test these hypotheses.
