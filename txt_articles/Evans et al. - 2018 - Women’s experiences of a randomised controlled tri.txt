Abstract
Background
Women’s experience of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is associated with mental ill-
ness which may not be addressed by domestic violence advocacy. The study aimed to com-
pare the experiences of women receiving a psychological intervention with women receiving
usual advocacy in a randomized controlled trial (PATH: Psychological Advocacy Towards
Healing), to illuminate the trial results by exploring women’s experiences of benefits and
difficulties.
Methods
A qualitative study nested within the PATH trial, based in two DVA agencies in the UK. A
purposive sample of thirty-one intervention and usual care participants were interviewed up
to three interviews over a year. Thematic analysis was carried out, incorporating concepts
from the Trans-Theoretical Model of change.
Findings
The PATH trial reports a clinically relevant improvement in mental health outcomes for
women receiving the intervention compared to usual advocacy. The qualitative study
reveals which elements of the intervention were beneficial or problematic, which outcomes
were most meaningful and relevant to participants and highlights reasons for variations in
adherence. Women valued the educational, psychological and emotional elements of the
intervention, they felt safe to explore repressed emotions for the first time and experienced a
reduction in self-blame, improved sense of identity and greater self-esteem. They also incor-
porated new skills and self-help techniques to enable sustainable change. Women receiving
usual advocacy reported un-met needs for psychological and emotional support. Adherence
was affected by women’s ‘psychological ‘readiness’ to engage, the competing demands of
practical issues such as housing insecurity, legal proceedings or the availability of child
care, and breaks in the continuity of professional care.

Introduction
Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) can be physical, sexual, psychological and economic, per-
petrated by a partner, ex-partner or adult family member. Women experiencing DVA have
increased risk of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use and suicidality
[1,2,3] but their mental health needs are not generally met by standard psychological interven-
tions such as counselling and cognitive behaviour therapy [4]. Treatments that do not directly
address the violence may be ineffective or even harmful [5,6,7]. In-depth studies of recovery
from DVA reveal the importance of promoting self-empowerment and resilience amongst
women, to protect against future abuse [8–10].
In the United Kingdom and the United States, many women who experience DVA self-
refer or are referred to specialist agencies where advocates provide practical and emotional
support, including safety planning and access to crisis accommodation. Qualitative studies of
women experiencing DVA highlight the importance of psychological as well as practical sup-
port to promote sustainable change and to help women stay free of abuse [11–13]. However,
DVA advocates are not usually trained to address mental health needs.
The Psychological Advocacy Towards Healing (PATH) trial, published alongside this arti-
cle, aimed to improve psychological functioning and mental health for women experiencing
DVA through a specialist psychological intervention delivered by specially trained DVA advo-
cates [14]. Details of the intervention are provided in the accompanying article and our proto-
col paper [14, 15]. Here we report the findings of a qualitative study nested in the trial.
Qualitative studies in trials have an important role in interpretation of trial findings and
increasing our understanding of how contextual barriers and facilitators may influence out-
comes, [16–21]. Understanding context is critical in interpreting the results of a trial and gen-
eralising beyond it, enhancing external validity [17, 20, 21]. Insights from qualitative research
can also inform implementation if the intervention is successful and can help trialists ‘to be
sensitive to the human beings who participate in trials’ [20]. Another value of qualitative work
is the application of social science theory in understanding mechanisms of change [17]. The
design of the nested qualitative study and the interpretation of data were informed by a modi-
fied version of the Trans-Theoretical Model of Health Behaviour Change [22]. In this qualita-
tive study our primary aim was to identify outcomes most valued by participants and to
explore barriers and facilitators to adherence to the intervention. A secondary aim was to com-
pare the experiences of women receiving the intervention alongside usual DVA advocacy with
those receiving advocacy alone.
Methods
We recruited a purposive sub-sample of thirty-one PATH trial participants across a range of
age, income and ethnicity, with and without children, based in safe houses (shelters) and in the
community, and from both arms of the trial, which was based in DVA agencies in two cities in
the United Kingdom. The PATH intervention was designed by RAD. DVA advocates from

 two participating agencies were trained by RAD over a period of three months to deliver up to
ten one-to-one weekly sessions with women seeking support for DVA. The content was psy-
cho-educational and included help to recognise abuse, an opportunity to explore personal
experiences and on-going affects of abuse and to learn self-help strategies.
Recruitment took place between May 2011 and March 2012. Participants were approached
face-to-face and, following written informed consent, they were invited to take part in a maxi-
mum of three semi-structured interviews: at the beginning and end of the intervention and
after one year of follow-up, with equivalent times for usual care participant The number and
spacing of interviews aimed to be responsive to the availability and the experiences of the
women, which varied for each individual. We aimed to collect sufficient data to fulfil the study
aims, reaching data saturation where possible.
An advisory group of women survivors of DVA, gave advice on the development of infor-
mation leaflets, topic guides and study processes, and provided input into the interpretation of
data.
ME an experienced female researcher, conducted the interviews, following a topic guide
(Table 1: Topic Guide(Qualitative interviews). Interviews took place at a safe location where
the risk of contact with the perpetrator was minimised. Locations included a local authority

 housing office, a healthcare centre, the home of a participant’s relative or the participant’s own
home. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
The data were coded and thematic analysis was carried out using the qualitative software
NVivo. The coding strategy and themes were developed using an iterative process involving all
the authors. Reading, re-reading and coding of transcripts was carried out by ME and KB in
close collaboration. Attention was given to the exploration of contradictory and minority
themes. Data from repeat interviews were used to develop narratives for individual cases [23].
Verification of the emerging codes was provided by double coding of some transcripts by ME
and KB. GF and RAD also part-coded some transcripts. Themes were identified from the
study questions and others emerged from the data. The constant comparison approach was
used to continuously refine the themes and re-code earlier transcripts. Consensus was gained
by all authors and the Advisory Panel who provided verification and credibility checking of
the themes and the data interpretation. All authors were unaware of the trial results during the
qualitative data analysis to avoid bias in data interpretation [17,18]. The findings are presented
here with knowledge of the quantitative results, to enhance our interpretation of trial
outcomes.
The study was approved by the UK South West National Research Ethics Service. Trial Reg-
istration: ISRCTN58561170. The application for trial registration was submitted to ISRCTN
on 23.02.2011. Registration was delayed because ISRCTN suggested a fee waiver for National
Institute for Health Research funded studies that are adopted into the NIHR portfolio. The
adoption process was unexpectedly lengthy and delayed the finalisation of ISRCTN registra-
tion, confirmed on 26.07.2011.
Results
Characteristics of the sample
We recruited twenty-one women from the trial intervention group and ten from the usual care
group (Table 2). A further four women who consented to contact could not be traced. Twelve
of the intervention group completed the full course of ten SPA sessions (‘completers’). Nine
women attended between one and seven sessions, with an average of 4.5 [‘non-completers’].
The number and spacing of qualitative research interviews varied according to the availability
of participants (Table 3).
This study was nested within the PATH trial (Psychological Advocacy Towards Healing)
that reports a clinically relevant improvement (article submitted). This qualitative study illumi-
nates these results by revealing elements of the intervention women regarded as either benefi-
cial or problematic and by giving insights into outcomes that were most meaningful and
relevant to them. Their accounts reveal the complexity of the therapeutic processes and the
range of benefits experienced by participants.

 The results are presented in two sections. First, the experience of intervention and usual
care participants are compared. Second, the experiences of ‘completers’ and ‘non-completers’
of the intervention are compared, to gain insight into barriers and facilitators to adherence to
the intervention, and to further our interpretation of the Complier-average Causal Effect
(CACE) analysis in the trial. This showed greater benefits for women who attended more ses-
sions, proportional to the number attended.
The findings are illustrated by verbatim quotations from participants (see Supporting
Informaiton S1 Text. Verbatim quotations from participants).
Comparison between intervention and usual care groups
We identified specific elements of the intervention and specific outcomes which women con-
sidered the most important and meaningful. This provides a more nuanced understanding of
the potential benefit of the intervention over usual (advocacy) care, including benefits that
were not captured by trial outcome measures.
(i) Relationship with SPA or advocate.
The most important aspect of the intervention
for participants was their relationship with their SPA or advocate, who had knowledge and
understanding of DVA gained through their work and, sometimes, from personal experience.
Women welcomed the chance to talk to someone, outside their network of friends and family,
who was non-judgmental, and was offering help. Following the initial relief of making contact,
however, the experience of women in the two groups diverged over time. Women receiving
the intervention valued the regular, predictable pattern of SPA sessions once a week or a fort-
night, with flexibility around child-care and school holidays, alternating with advocacy ses-
sions. Women receiving usual care were dissatisfied with the less regular, less predictable
contact they experienced.
In the intervention group, women described a close, confiding relationship with their SPA,
which was a crucial part of their PATH experience. SPAs were described as compassionate,
warm, empathic, calm, intelligent and thoughtful; like a trustworthy friend with whom the
women easily bonded, with no sense of the professional distance they had anticipated from
their image of a ‘counsellor’.
The data reveal that SPAs modelled a caring, person-centred, affirmative and non-judg-
mental relationship, contrasting sharply with women’s everyday experience of an abusive rela-
tionship. Rapport and trust were built through shared laughter and banter. Women valued
their SPA’s astuteness in identifying and challenging, rather than colluding with, their auto-
matic, ingrained patterns of behaviour, such as self-deprecation or the use of tactics to avoid
facing the reality of abuse. Women were encouraged to get to the heart of issues, to identify
and release painful emotions. SPAs suggested strategies to avoid abuse in the future.

 A rare contrasting case was provided by one PATH ‘completer’ who felt her SPA was reserved,
with limited ability to provide emotional support or to help her explore her feelings in depth.
In the usual care group, omen became aware, over time, of the limited availability of their
advocate, and their lack of control over the timing or frequency of her visits. Women said their
advocates primarily gave practical support for re-housing, financial, legal or child-care issues,
rather than psychological and emotional support, and tended to give quick unhelpful
responses to their distress. In contrast, women receiving the intervention talked about the
time, attention and emotional exploration offered by their SPA. At follow-up, very few usual
care women felt they had received emotional as well as practical support from their advocate,
and many felt let down by only having ‘occasional chats’ rather than more substantial psycho-
logical support or counselling.
(ii) Emotional and cognitive outcomes.
All participants described anxious or depressed
feelings at first interview. The majority had been prescribed anti-depressants but few had
taken them. Some women had previously experienced counselling without a specific focus on
DVA, which had limited usefulness, and some felt stigmatised when offered counselling via
mental health services.
At follow-up, few women in the intervention group spontaneously mentioned improvements
in mood as a key outcome, although after prompting more women did report a reduction in
mood swings, panic attacks, or anxious and depressed feelings. More important outcomes for
them were the ability to identify and understand patterns of abusive behaviour, which led to an
increase in confidence, self-esteem and sense of identity, and a reduction in self-blame. They
reported feeling more assertive, better able to trust and communicate with others. Improved
mood was perceived as contingent on these more fundamental changes. Cognitive changes were
also valued, such as learning techniques to curb negative automatic thoughts, to develop a more
positive outlook, and to recognise the warning signs of DVA in order to avoid future abuse.
Women also described feeling more comfortable talking about and caring for themselves
rather than prioritising others, more able to express their emotions rather than repressing
them or drinking alcohol. They also experienced improved concentration and better sleep. Sig-
nificant markers of changes included improved communication and relationships with family
members including their children and, for some, increased confidence to seek social contacts,
employment or further support. Some women had difficulty persisting with new patterns of
thinking and behaving in the face of on-going harassment, but were learning to respond differ-
ently, for example by not answering texts from the perpetrator.
Whether or not they completed all the sessions, women described integrating new under-
standing and skills learnt from their SPA into daily life at one-year follow-up. They continued
to use hand-outs and techniques and recommended them to others.
In contrast, in the usual care group, women’s narratives were dominated by their ‘physical
trajectory’, moving to a safe location, returning to work or to college, but without a sense of
moving on emotionally or psychologically. Unable to identify or break deeply ingrained
responses to abuse, women continued to self-blame, experienced difficulty asking for or
accepting help, and felt unable to escape on-going harassment. Rarely, participants described
learning useful self-help techniques from their advocate; for example dealing with stress by
going for a walk, having a relaxing bath with candles and phoning someone for a chat.
At follow-up, with very few exceptions, usual care women highlighted the lack of emo-
tional-psychological support as a key deficiency in service provision, and recognised their on-
going need for some kind of counselling. Some were on long waiting lists.
(iii) Identifying key elements of the intervention.
Choice and flexibility emerged as key
elements valued by participants. Women varied in their preferences for particular techniques
and topic areas, but valued being offered choice, which represented a stark contrast to an

 abusive relationship where choice is very limited. SPAs tailored sessions to individual needs
and suggested hand-outs and exercises for continuity between sessions. Women valued many
techniques including writing down feelings, saying affirmations, writing a letter to the perpe-
trator to later destroy, keeping a journal, talking to the perpetrator as if he was in the room,
relaxation and visualisation, self-nurturing, and expressing anger using experiential tech-
niques. A favoured technique was to write down difficult thoughts or feelings, put them into a
real or imaginary box and store them until they were ready to look at them or destroy them in
order to move on. Some women disliked some or all of the PATH techniques, particularly role
play and anger work, and were encouraged to find their own self-help strategies such as spend-
ing time with a favourite pet, or taking long walks.
Comparison between PATH ‘completers’ and ‘non-completers’: Factors
affecting adherence
We conducted follow-up interviews with seven of the nine interviewees who did not complete
all SPA sessions. ‘Non-completers’ spoke positively about their early experience of SPA ses-
sions at first interview. At follow-up many said they had worked through important issues,
gained a better understanding of DVA, learned coping strategies and were ready to move on
without completing all the sessions. Other ‘non-completers’ felt the psychological process was
unfinished and they hoped to continue at a later stage.
‘Non-completers’ gave three main reasons for not attending the complete course: ‘emo-
tional stress’, ‘psychological desire to move on’ and ‘lack of continuity with SPA’. An additional
theme of ‘level of engagement’ emerged from the data.
Emotional stress.
Some women felt the intervention was too emotionally draining at that
point in their lives. They described feeling overwhelmed after a SPA session and too vulnerable
to deal with pressing concerns such as the demands of young children or a pending court case.
This sense of vulnerability was exacerbated by a perceived lack of support in between sessions
when SPAs were not easily available.
Psychological desire to move on. Some non-completers wanted to focus on the future
and put the experience of DVA behind them. SPA sessions served as a reminder of past distress
and bad memories, ‘digging up what I’ve buried’. Some women preferred to stick to old coping
strategies such as blanking out painful feelings, or felt that recovery from abuse was a matter of
time rather than intervention.
Lack of continuity of SPA. As a corollary to high investment in their relationship with
their SPA, women felt easily let down if there was a break in continuity of contact. This was a
major reason for failing to complete SPA sessions. Three vulnerable time points emerged. First
was the gap between one SPA session and the next, when some women wished for easier access
to their SPA by telephone or in person. Second was any break in the continuity of sessions or a
change of SPA owing to maternity leave, illness or a SPA leaving the service. Third was loss of
contact if a participant moved house or lost her mobile phone.
Nine of the twenty-one intervention women experienced a break in continuity, without
adequate explanation. This left them feeling vulnerable and uncertain as to what was happen-
ing next. If contact with the agency was eventually restored, some women went on to complete
the full course of sessions. Others were unwilling to re-engage, either because it meant starting
with a different SPA or they felt they had already ‘moved on’ in the intervening time.
When the full course of sessions ended, ‘completers’ generally felt well prepared for its end-
ing and inevitable separation from their SPA, marked by an exchange of gifts. A minority
would have preferred a more gradual weaning from their SPA over a longer time and one
‘completer’ felt that she had lost her ‘link to life’.

 Levels of engagement.
Women varied in their preference, from ‘deep’ emotional engage-
ment with SPA sessions to a preference for learning everyday skills and strategies. Our data
suggest that women who engaged more deeply were more likely to complete their sessions.
Completers were also more likely to have been longer in an abusive relationship (mean: 11
years) than ‘non-completers’ (mean: 4.5 years), and were more likely to have experienced mul-
tiple abusive relationships, in childhood, adulthood or both [see Table 3]. In contrast, women
without historic abuse were generally less keen on ‘deep’ emotional work and preferred to
engage at the level of learning new skills and self-help strategies. They did not always feel the
need to complete the full course.
Contextual factors limited adherence to the intervention for some women, for example the
constraints of child-care, the emotional and practical demands of parenting and working, or
the busy, chaotic environment of a refuge with little personal space. Women at home owing to
poor health or retirement, without young children, had fewer competing demands and greater
availability to fully engage with the intervention.
Women completing the full intervention course found it intense, rewarding and emotion-
ally challenging; for some it was ‘life-changing’. They were, for the first time, able to identify,
acknowledge and express long-repressed anger, grief and fear, and to disclose recent and his-
toric abuse. For some the relief was immediate; for others the benefits were gradual. The trans-
formative power of the PATH intervention led many women on a powerful healing journey,
conceptualised as weaving a silk tapestry, fitting missing pieces of a jig-saw, climbing up steps
on a ladder or pushing a little bird out of the nest.
Discussion
This qualitative study adds important detail to the PATH trial finding of a clinically relevant
improvement in mental health outcomes for women receiving an intervention delivered by
specialist psychological advocates (SPAs) compared to usual advocacy. The qualitative study
reveals which elements of the intervention women regarded as beneficial or problematic and
which outcomes were most meaningful and relevant to them, such as a reduction in self-
blame, improved sense of identity and greater self-esteem. It also provides important insights
into factors affecting adherence to the intervention. The findings will help to refine and target
the intervention in future. Women’s accounts reveal the complexity of the therapeutic pro-
cesses that resulted in wide-ranging benefits beyond or even in the absence of improvement in
mental health status per se.
Women described benefits such as better understanding of DVA, increased self-confidence
and improved coping strategies, which led to a reduction in mental health symptoms. Women
receiving usual advocacy reported an un-met need for psychological support.
Women’s narratives suggest that an intervention combining educational, behavioural, emo-
tional and psychological elements helped them deal with the emotional and psychological
sequelae of DVA, with the potential for sustainable change. Participants highlighted the impor-
tance of delivery by DVA specialists rather than mental health specialists, which corroborates
previous findings that referral for psychological counselling without a DVA focus does not
necessarily meet the needs of these women [8].
Strengths of the study include repeat interviews over one year provided insights into short
and long-term outcomes. The purposive sample enabled comparisons between intervention
and usual care participants, participants with different levels of adherence, and the identifica-
tion of contradictory views. The data were analysed without knowledge of the trial outcomes.
Limitations include attrition meant that we could not trace ten participants for a final inter-
view. There were only a few participants from minority ethnic groups.

 Our qualitative analysis adds to the PATH trial findings, by identifying changes in psycho-
logical benefits that may be difficult to quantify, such as the provision of a safe place to explore
previously un-expressed emotions, an improved understanding of DVA and the development
of a more positive sense of self. Women learnt new coping strategies and felt more in control
of their life and future. Comparing data from intervention and usual care participants suggests
that PATH gives added value in relation to educational, cognitive, psychological and emo-
tional outcomes compared to usual advocacy.
The trial reported improved outcomes for women with greater PATH adherence [14].
Insights into reasons for poor adherence are therefore crucial. The qualitative study highlights
level of emotional distress, competing contextual issues, the psychological desire to move on
and lack of continuity with the SPA as important factors. Receptivity to PATH may depend on
where a woman is situated with regards to safety and freedom from fear, her level of distress
and duration of abuse as well as her need to sort out immediate issues such as housing, legal
proceedings and access to children. Our findings suggest that, for maximum benefit, attention
must be paid to the timing of the intervention, following an assessment of individual ‘psycho-
logical readiness’ [13].
The concept of women’s ‘psycho-social readiness’ for change emerged from the application
of the trans-theoretical model of change to DVA research. It highlights both the inner
resources and external factors that need to be in place for a DVA survivor to engage with and
benefit from an intervention [11,13,24,25,26]. Our qualitative data support the usefulness of
the concept in explaining why some women engaged with and benefitted from the interven-
tion more than others. Implementation of the PATH intervention could be targeted, following
individual assessment or triage, to those most likely to benefit and at the most suitable time.
Although completion of a course of SPA sessions was important for maximum benefit,
many ‘non-completers’ achieved important outcomes after attending less than ten sessions
and did not wish to continue. Participants also expressed variation in their preferred level, or
depth, of engagement. The potential to tailor the number and content of sessions to individual
need could form part of the initial PATH assessment process.
Hearing the voices of DVA survivors is essential in designing and implementing interven-
tions and services. The PATH model is a complex intervention comprising educational, beha-
vioural, emotional and psychological elements. This study was carried out in the context of a
large trial, which enabled access to a wide range of participants in two major cities in the UK.
The results will be transferable to other urban contexts worldwide. The most highly valued fea-
ture for women receiving PATH was the working alliance with their SPA, a DVA specialist,
embedded in an agency providing support and advocacy for DVA. Continuity of provision
from a single advocate should be the gold standard, and any unavoidable transitions should be
sensitively handled. Further research could explore the feasibility of adapting the PATH model
for use in the community in order to reach the many women who do not access specialist ser-
vices. Referral to a service based on the PATH model could form part of a package of options
available via primary or secondary health care, based on the successful and widely imple-
mented IRIS model [27].
This study in combination with the quantitative results, fidelity analysis and feedback from
DVA professionals involved in the trial, will inform the future development and implementa-
tion of the PATH model.
