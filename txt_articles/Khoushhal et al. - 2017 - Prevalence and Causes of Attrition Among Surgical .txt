IMPORTANCE Attrition of residents from general surgery training programs is relatively high;
however, there are wide discrepancies in the prevalence and causes of attrition reported
among surgical residents in previous studies.
OBJECTIVE To summarize the estimate of attrition prevalence among general surgery
residents.
DATA SOURCES We searched the Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and ERIC databases
(January 1, 1946, to October 22, 2015) for studies reporting on the prevalence and causes of
attrition in surgical residents, as well as the characteristics and destinations of residents who
left general surgery training programs. Database searches were conducted on October 22,
2015.
STUDY SELECTION Eligibility criteria included all studies reporting on the primary (attrition
prevalence) or secondary (causes of attrition and characteristics and destination of residents
who leave residency programs) outcomes in peer-reviewed journals. Commentaries, reviews,
and studies reporting on preliminary surgery programs were excluded. Of the 41 full-text
articles collected from the title/abstract screening, 22 studies (53.7%) met the selection
criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently collected and summarized
the data. We calculated pooled estimates using random effects meta-analyses where
appropriate.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Attrition prevalence of general surgery residents.
RESULTS Overall, we included 22 studies that reported on residents (n = 19 821) from general
surgery programs. The pooled estimate for the overall attrition prevalence among general
surgery residents was 18% (95% CI, 14%-21%), with significant between-study variation
(I2 = 96.8%; P < .001). Attrition was significantly higher among female compared with male
(25% vs 15%, respectively; P = .008) general surgery residents, and most residents left after
their first postgraduate year (48%; 95% CI, 39%-57%). Departing residents often relocated
to another general surgery program (20%; 95% CI, 15%-24%) or switched to anesthesia
(13%; 95% CI, 11%-16%) and other specialties. The most common reported causes of attrition
were uncontrollable lifestyle (range, 12%-87.5%) and transferring to another specialty (range,
19%-38.9%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE General surgery programs have relatively high attrition, with
female residents more likely to leave their training programs than male residents. Residents
most often relocate or switch to another specialty after the first postgraduate year owing to
lifestyle-related issues.

espite the introduction of national regulations on resi-
dent duty hour restrictions by the Accreditation Coun-
cil for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in 2003,
residentattritionremainsasignificantissue,particularlyingen-
eral surgery training programs. General surgery residency pro-
grams are among the most competitive training programs to
join, and they often attract high-profile applicants.1-3 How-
ever, the attrition rate of general surgery residents (reported
to range from 2% to 26%) appears to be relatively higher than
other specialties, which poses major challenges at the pro-
gram, institutional, and postgraduate medical education
levels.4-8
Although resident attrition is well known to be a signifi-
cant problem in surgical training, data on factors associated
with attrition are unclear. Previous studies have suggested
residents may leave general surgery training programs for a
variety of reasons, including undesirable lifestyle, excessive
work hours, emotional difficulties, performance issues, lack
of personal support network, or dissatisfaction with the
medical profession altogether.9 However, to our knowledge,
no study has systematically summarized the strength and
magnitude of the association between these factors and
attrition. Furthermore, data are unclear about the career
choices of residents who leave general surgery training
programs. Current knowledge indicates that these residents
often transfer to other surgical specialties, but may also
transfer to nonsurgical specialties or leave medicine
altogether.10
Therefore, the primary aim of our study was to summa-
rize the current evidence to determine the prevalence of at-
trition among general surgery residents. Furthermore, we
sought to establish the drivers of attrition in general surgery
residency programs, identify the characteristics of residents
who left their training programs, and examine the destina-
tions of outgoing residents.
Methods
Study Design and Registration
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in ac-
cordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-
views and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.11 Our pre-
definedprotocolwasregisteredattheInternationalProspective
Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD 42015027420).
Inclusion Criteria and Outcomes
All studies that reported either the primary outcome (preva-
lence of attrition among general surgery residents) or any of
the secondary outcomes (attrition causes, characteristics
of residents who left, and destination of residents who left)
of interest were included. Commentaries, reviews, and
studies not published in peer-reviewed journals were
excluded. In addition, studies of preliminary general sur-
gery programs were excluded to avoid including general
surgery residents who transferred to their designated spe-
cialty program (eg, anesthesia or radiology) after the pre-
liminary year in general surgery.
Information Sources and Search Strategies
In collaboration with an expert librarian, we conducted a com-
prehensivesearchof5electronicdatabases(Medline,EMBASE,
ERIC, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library; January 1, 1946, to
October 22, 2015). The search strategy combined terms of
surgical residents with terms related to attrition. No language
restrictions were applied. The search strategy was peer-
reviewed using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategy
checklist.12 A full search strategy is included in the eAppen-
dixintheSupplement.Searchresultsfromthe5databaseswere
merged using EndNote (Thomson Reuters Scientific LLC) and
duplicate references were discarded. We also searched the ref-
erences of the included full-text articles to ensure literature
saturation, and we contacted experts for additional data
sources. Database searches were conducted on October 22,
2015.
Study Selection, Data Extraction, and Data Items
Two reviewers (Z.K. and M.A.H.) independently screened the
titles and abstracts of all studies that resulted from the search
to determine eligibility for full-text review, reviewed full-
text articles of all potentially relevant articles, and extracted
data from eligible full-text articles. Data collection forms were
developed to capture variables of interest (eg, author, recruit-
ment period, study design, and sample number); they were pi-
loted on 5 randomly selected studies and refined as appropri-
ate. Disagreements were resolved as a group.
Assessment of Study Quality
Two reviewers (Z.K. and M.A.H.) independently assessed each
included study for quality (or risk of bias) using the Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and modified Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale for cross-sectional studies.13 This instrument
assesses the quality of cohort studies in terms of selection of
study cohorts, comparability of the cohorts, and outcomes as-
certainment using a star system. An overall score ranging from
0 to 9 for cohort studies and 0 to 5 for cross-sectional studies
was determined for each study. Cohort studies were catego-
rized as having a high (score <6), moderate (score 6 or 7), or low
(score 8 or 9) risk of bias; cross-sectional studies were catego-
rized as having either a high (score <3) or low (score 3-5) risk of
bias. Disagreements were discussed and resolved as a group.
Key Points
Question What is the attrition prevalence among surgical
residents?
Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis found that the
pooled estimate of attrition prevalence among general surgery
residents was 18%, female residents were more likely to leave than
male residents, and residents were most likely to leave after the
first postgraduate year owing to an uncontrollable lifestyle. The
most common destination of residents who left was relocating to
another general surgery program or switch to another specialty.
Meaning Attrition prevalence is relatively high among general
surgery residents and future research should focus on developing
strategies to limit resident attrition.

Data Synthesis and Analysis
For categorical general surgery residents, pooled estimates
(proportions) of attrition prevalence and characteristics and
destinations of residents who left were calculated using ran-
dom-effects meta-analyses.14 Between-study heterogeneity
was examined using I2 statistic. A high level of heterogeneity
was indicated by an I2 statistic value of 75% and greater.15,16
Inaddition,weexaminedattritionprevalenceofresidentsfrom
categorical general surgery programs based on the following
subgroups: timing of study (before vs after the ACGME 80-
hour policy implementation) and whether attrition was vol-
untary or involuntary (dismissal). We also conducted a sensi-
tivity analysis to assess the robustness of our results by
restricting the analysis to studies that only reported results
frommultipletrainingprograms.Inaddition,weexaminedthe
influence of each study on the overall estimate by excluding
one study at a time and rerunning the meta-analysis. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed using Stata version 13 (Stata-
Corp LP), with a P value of less than .05 for statistical tests
considered statistically significant.17

ofbias(eTable1andeTable2intheSupplement).Ofthe22total
studies,only19wereincludedinthemeta-analyses.The2stud-
ies conducted outside of the United States were excluded from
the meta-analysis owing to significant heterogeneity in inter-
national training programs, and 1 study that only reported
qualitative data on the causes of attrition was also excluded.18
Primary Outcome: Attrition Prevalence
Sixteenstudiesreportedtheprevalenceofattritionamonggen-
eralsurgeryresidents(eTable3intheSupplement).Thepooled
estimatefortheoverallattritionprevalenceamonggeneralsur-
gery residents was 18% (95% CI, 14%-21%; P < .001), with sig-
nificant between-study variation (I2 = 96.8%; P < .001)
(Figure 2). Most of the residents left voluntarily (range, 60%-
96.4%). Dismissal rates ranged from 6.25% to 50% (eTable 3
in the Supplement). The pooled estimate of attrition preva-
lence reported from studies before the ACGME 80-hour work
policy implementation was 17% (95% CI, 12%-21%; P < .001;
I2 = 74.8%; n = 7 studies) compared with 14% (95% CI, 0%-
29%;P < .001;I2 = 97.5%;n = 3studies)afterthe80-hourwork
policyimplementation;thisdifferencewasnotstatisticallysig-
nificant (P = .43).
Secondary Outcomes
The most common cause of attrition was uncontrollable life-
style during general surgery resident training (range, 12%-
87.5%). The second most common reason of attrition was
choosing to join another specialty (range, 19%-38.9%). Other
reported causes included poor performance, dismissal, fam-
ily or spousal factors, health issues, and financial burden
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). Owing to the significant vari-
ability in the reporting of this outcome across studies, a meta-
analysis was not possible.
With respect to characteristics of residents who left, most
studies focused on reporting the sex and postgraduate year
(PGY) level of these residents (eTable 5 and eTable 6 in the
Supplement). Only studies that reported complete data strati-
fied by sex or PGY level of residents who left their training pro-
grams were included for subgroup analyses to minimize the
risk of selection bias. Meta-analysis of attrition prevalence by
sex showed attrition prevalence of 25% among female resi-
dents enrolled in general surgery programs (95% CI, 16%-
34%; P < .001; I2 = 88.2%; n = 11 studies) compared with 15%
formaleresidents(95%CI,11%-20%;P < .001;I2 = 96.7%;n = 11
studies) (Figure 3). Formal testing for subgroup differences
revealed that female residents had significantly higher attri-
tion prevalence (10% higher) than male residents (P = .008).
Of the total number of residents who left a general surgery
program, 48% (n = 816) left after the PGY 1 level (95% CI, 39%-
57%; P < .001; I2 = 91.7%; n = 11 studies) and 28% (n = 596)
after the PGY 2 level (95% CI, 22%-33%; P < .001; I2 = 78.02%;
n = 11 studies) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Overall, of all the residents who left, only 20% (95% CI,
15%-24%; n = 317; P < .001; I2 = 72.2%; n = 8 studies) relo-
cated to another general surgery program, whereas most
switched to another field or specialty (eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment). Anesthesia appeared to be the most popular nonge-
neral surgery medical specialty training program for resi-
dentswholeft(13%ofresidents[n = 241]wholeft;95%CI,11%-
16%; P < .001; I2 = 40.7%; n = 11 studies) (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement). Plastic surgery, radiology, and family medicine
were other common specialties that attracted general sur-
gery residents (eTable 7 in the Supplement).

the prevalence of overall attrition among general surgery resi-
dents by more than 2%. Second, we conducted sensitivity
analyses by restricting our meta-analyses to studies that only
reported results from multiple training programs. The pooled
estimatesforalloutcomeswerenearlyidenticalinmultiplepro-
grams only vs all studies (eFigure 3, eFigure 4, eFigure 5, eFig-
ure 6, and eFigure 7 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Overall, 22 studies included in our systematic review re-
portedattritionfromgeneralsurgeryprograms.Theoverallrate
of attrition among general surgery residents was 18% (95% CI,
14%-21%). The most common cause of attrition from general
surgery residency was uncontrollable lifestyle, followed by
choosing to join another specialty. Nearly 50% of residents left
after the PGY 1 level, and 30% left after PGY 2. Female resi-
dents were more likely to leave than male residents (25% vs
15%, respectively). Of the residents who left, 20% relocated to
anothergeneralsurgeryprogram(oftenowingtofamilyorgeo-
graphic preference),32 and 13% changed their specialty to
anesthesia.
There is a paucity of data available on surgical resident at-
trition from specialties other than general surgery. However,
it appears that the overall prevalence of attrition among gen-
eral surgery residents is comparable with that of obstetrics and
gynecology (range, 3.6%-21.6%)38-41 and neurosurgery (range,
14%-42.6%) residents,42,43 but relatively higher than ophthal-
mology (1.15%),44 otolaryngology (6%),45 and orthopedics
(5.3%) residents.46
A potential explanation for the wide range of overall at-
trition rates among different surgical specialties may be vari-
able demands of different surgical training programs. For in-
stance,comparedwithophthalmology,generalsurgerytraining
programs generally have greater clinical demands, which can
have significant consequences on resident lifestyle; uncon-
trollable lifestyle was identified as the most common cause of
attrition in our review. Furthermore, residents from other non-
surgicaltrainingprograms,suchasinternalmedicineandemer-
gency medicine, which are known to be more “lifestyle
friendly,” have lower reported rates of attrition than the more
clinically demanding programs, such as general surgery and
neurosurgery.31,40 In addition, we found that surgical resi-
dents who left their training programs most often switched to
lifestyle-friendly specialties such as anesthesia and family
medicine. This trend has also been noticed among graduat-

ing medical students who strongly consider lifestyle factors
when deciding on which medical specialty to pursue as a
career.47-50
We also found a quarter of female residents left their sur-
gical training programs compared with 15% of male resi-
dents. Several potential factors may account for this differ-
ence, such as a lack of appropriate role models for female
residents, particularly in surgical academia51-54; perception of
sex discrimination; negative attitudes toward women in sur-
gery; and sexual harassment.54-56 In addition, in a national sur-
vey of general surgery residents from the United States that
included 248 of 249 total training programs, women were
found less likely than men to report that their program pro-
vides support, and that they can turn to faculty when having
difficulties.57
National policies on resident duty hour restrictions were
implemented by the ACGME in 2003 in an attempt to regu-
lateresidenthoursandimproveresidentlifestylewithoutcom-
promising clinical care and resident training. However, a re-
cent systematic review conducted by Ahmed and colleagues58
showed that implementation of the current 80-hour-a-week
policy did not improve general surgery resident lifestyle. Fur-
thermore, the recently reported Flexibility in Duty Hour Re-
quirementsforSurgicalTraineesTrialinvolving117generalsur-
gery programs showed that residents randomized to the
flexible-policy arm were not more likely dissatisfied with over-
all well-being than those randomized to the standard-policy
arm (adhering to the existing ACGME hour restrictions). How-
ever, flexible-policy residents were more likely to perceive
negative effects of duty hours on time for family and friends
and were more likely to be dissatisfied with time for rest.59
There may be other more effective ways of retaining sur-
gical trainees than targeting work hours policy, such as for-
mally assigning mentors to support residents early in their
training.60Inaddition,moreexposuretosurgicalrotationsdur-
ing undergraduate medical education might facilitate appro-
priatecareerchoices.61,62Moreover,beingattachedtooneteam
during a surgical rotation may not give students a complete
picture of residency training.63-65 Hence, longer and varied ro-
tations may help medical students make more informed ca-
reer choices. Furthermore, adding a transition year between
medicalschoolandresidencytrainingwithrotationsinthegen-
eral specialties, such as general surgery and internal medi-
cine (which is the case in the United Kingdom and many other
countries), might help students recognize the actual de-
mands of general surgery training programs. Last, effective
screening processes for applicants to surgical residencies may
help reduce attrition. Kelz and colleagues28 have proposed
novel application screening methods that include essay re-
quirements for applicants focusing on stress management, pri-
oritization, and organizational abilities, which are all quali-
tiesneededtosucceedasasurgicalresident.Furtherstudyinto
novel models such as these may help identify appropriate can-
didates for surgical programs, especially because traditional
methods of evaluation, such as medical school attended, sur-
gery clerkship performance, US Medical Licensing Examina-
tion scores, and American Board of Surgery In-Training Ex-
amination scores, have failed to predict attrition.19,20,22,25,32
Limitations
The results of our study should be interpreted in light of some
limitations. First, there was considerable heterogeneity be-
tween studies, which remained high even when we re-
stricted the analysis to studies reporting data from multiple
training programs. This might be partially due to program-
specific factors such as the size and the type of program (uni-
versity, community, and military programs). Second, most of
the studies did not adequately control for confounding fac-
tors such as age, sex, medical school attended, and program
type. Third, the duration of follow-up among studies varied
widely (range, 1-20 years of follow-up). Fourth, because most
of the included studies were conducted in the United States,
the results cannot be generalized to training programs out-
side of the United States. Finally, nearly all of the studies in-
cluded were retrospective in design, and more than half re-
ported data from a single training program. However,
sensitivity analysis that only included multiple programs stud-
ies did not change our conclusions.
Conclusions
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that the
pooledestimateofoverallattritionamonggeneralsurgeryresi-
dents was 18%, and the most common cause of attrition was
uncontrollable lifestyle. Female residents were more likely to
leave their training program compared with male residents,
with most (about 80%) of the residents leaving within the first
2 years of training. Residents often relocated to another gen-
eral surgery program or changed specialty to more lifestyle-
friendly specialties. Future studies should focus on develop-
ing interventions to limit resident attrition.

Invited Commentary
Preventing General Surgery Residency Attrition—
It Is All About the Mentoring
Julie A. Freischlag, MD; Michelle M. Silva, BA
While it is no secret that general surgery residency attrition
poses a threat to the US surgical workforce, facts around the
causes and prevalence have been ambiguous. The data sum-
marized by Khoushhal and colleagues1 in “Prevalence and
CausesofAttritionAmongSurgicalResidents:ASystematicRe-
view and Meta-analysis” provide insights that can inform
retention strategies.
What can be done to stem the tide of surgical resident at-
trition? I cannot say enough about the power of mentorship,
which has been cited by many studies as a critical retention
tool during and after residency.2,3 We mentor to help people
reach their full potential: we cheer them on when they suc-
ceed and guide them when
they encounter obstacles.
Surgical residency is no-
toriously arduous and the longer hours compared with other
specialties can take a toll on some residents. That’
s why it’
s im-
portant for mentors to keep a watchful eye on resident men-
tees. Those who are thinking about leaving may be too over-
whelmedtoseehowtheirtalentshavegreatvalue.Aseducators
andclinicians,wehavearesponsibilitytocultivate—notwaste—
this valuable potential.
At the University of California Davis School of Medicine,
we have established a mentorship culture that comes from a
fundamental recognition that it builds community and makes
all of us more successful. For example, our speed mentoring
program enables junior faculty to get advice from chairs and
department directors on topics such as improving time man-
agement, developing a national reputation, and obtaining re-
search funding. In addition, we emphasize a collaborative and
supportive resident environment in each department. Great
examples of this include our general surgery and vascular sur-
gery residency programs, which have fostered a sense of ca-
maraderie that has enabled residents to listen to each other,
collaborate on research, and enjoy outside activities to-
gether. Two female vascular surgery faculty members and I re-
cently took 4 vascular surgery residents wine tasting in Napa
County,California.Thesekindsofcollegialactivitieshavebeen
cited as indicators of resident satisfaction.4
Mentorshipandsupportisespeciallyimportantforwomen.
I was disheartened that this study showed a quarter of women
leave surgical training programs compared with 15% of male
residents. As a woman who has built a career in a tradition-
ally male-dominated field, I can understand the unique chal-
lenges that female residents face, particularly conscious and
unconscious biases that remain pervasive despite recent ef-
fortsforequality.Mentorsforwomendon’
thavetobewomen—
most of my early mentors were men—and male vascular sur-
geons do play a critical role in developing the careers of female
residents, especially in parts of the country where there are
few or no female vascular surgeon mentors.5,6

body who will make us do what we can.

me to reach higher when I could, and to keep going when times
