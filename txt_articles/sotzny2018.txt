Abstract 
 
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a frequent and severe 
chronic disease drastically impairing life quality. The underlying pathomechanism is 
incompletely understood yet but there is convincing evidence that in at least a subset of 
patients ME/CFS has an autoimmune etiology. In this review, we will discuss current 
autoimmune aspects for ME/CFS. Immune dysregulation in ME/CFS has been frequently 
described including changes in cytokine profiles and immunoglobulin levels, T- and B-cell 
phenotype and a decrease of natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, autoantibodies against 
various antigens including neurotransmitter receptors have been recently identified in 
ME/CFS individuals by several groups. Consistently, clinical trials from Norway have shown 
that B-cell depletion with rituximab results in clinical benefits in about half of  ME/CFS 
patients. Furthermore, recent studies have provided evidence for severe metabolic 
disturbances presumably mediated by serum autoantibodies in ME/CFS. Therefore, further 
efforts are required to delineate the role of autoantibodies in the onset and pathomechanisms 
of ME/CFS in order to better understand and properly treat this disease.

1. Introduction 
 
With an estimated prevalence of 0.2-0.3%, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue 
Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multisystem disease with unknown etiology. Patients suffer from 
persistent exhaustion, cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, chronic pain and flu-like 
symptoms, leading to a substantial reduction of life quality [1]. 
ME/CFS disease onset is often reported to be triggered by infections and the link between 
infections and autoimmune diseases is well established [2]. Although the exact pathogenesis 
is still unknown, the most plausible hypothesis is that dysregulation of immune system, 
autonomic nervous system and metabolic disturbances contribute to this complex syndrome, 
in which severe fatigue and cognitive impairment are a central feature (Fig. 1). Stressful life 
events are frequently associated with disease onset concomitantly with a history of frequent 
recurrent infections, immune deficiency and autoimmunity [1, 3]. There are numerous studies 
showing immunological, genetic and metabolic alterations consistent with an autoimmune 
mechanism. Further, the identification of autoantibodies in ME/CFS patients and the clinical 
benefit associated with B cell depleting therapy provide strong evidence that, at least in a 
subset of ME/CFS patients, the disease has an autoimmune etiology.

Infection by various pathogens, including the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the human herpes 
virus (HHV)-6 and the human parvovirus B19, but also intracellular bacteria, are known as 
triggers of disease [1, 4-6]. In a subset of patients, ME/CFS begins with infectious 
mononucleosis and evidence for a potential role of EBV in ME/CFS comes from many 
studies [4, 7-9]. In 1984, DuBois et al. first described patients with mononucleosis syndrome 
suffering from long-lasting fatigue and serological evidence of EBV reactivation [4] followed 
by a number of studies describing ME/CFS patients with serological evidence of chronic 
active EBV infection [7-9]. Infectious mononucleosis is known as a risk factor for various

autoimmune diseases [2, 10]. Several studies show homologies of EBV sequences with 
human autoantigens such as myelin basic protein for multiple sclerosis (MS) [11]. In a study 
from our group enhanced IgG reactivity against an EBNA-6 repeat sequence was found in 
ME/CFS patients [9]. Homologous sequences of various human proteins with an EBNA-6 
repeat sequence might be potential targets for antigenic mimicry. 
Detection of anti-HHV-6 IgM antibodies and HHV-6 antigen in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) and mucosa as evidence for HHV-6 reactivation is more frequent in patients 
with ME/CFS compared to healthy donors, showing that reactivation of persistent HHV-6 
infection could be a trigger factor for ME/CFS [12-15]. In studies from our group evidence for 
an active HHV-6, HHV-7 or B19 infection was found in a subset of patients and was 
associated with subfebrility and lymphadenopathy [16]. Others, however, showed no 
difference between severity of symptoms and viral load of HHV-6 and HHV-7 in DNA from 
saliva and PBMCs among ME/CFS patients and controls [17]. It should be noted that HHV-6 
and HHV-7 infect immune cells, preferentially CD4+ T cells, but also CD8+, 
monocytes/macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells involved in cellular, humoral and innate 
immune response [18, 19]. Infection of immune cells by these viruses lead to changes in cell 
surface receptor expression, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine and 
chemokine expression level modulating local inflammation and immune response. A role for 
HHV-6 has been proposed in several autoimmune diseases, including MS, autoimmune 
connective tissue diseases, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis [20]. Molecular mimicry between 
myelin basic protein and an HHV-6 cell membrane protein is suggested to explain this link in 
MS [21]. Further, for ME/CFS and Gulf War Illness antibodies against the human dUTPase 
were reported by Halpin et al. [22]. These autoantibodies mainly occur together with 
antibodies against at least one of multiple HHV-encoded dUTPases suggesting an antigenic 
mimicry. 
Parvovirus B19 infection has been shown to lead to development of ME/CFS. B19-triggered 
ME/CFS may be associated with a persistent viremia or may occur without viremia [23] and 
increased circulating TNF-α and IFN-γ were shown [24]. B19-associated ME/CFS was, in

some cases, effectively treated with intravenous IgG [5, 25, 26]. Documented mechanisms in 
the pathogenesis of B19-associated autoimmunity include cross reaction of anti-B19 
antibodies with human proteins, B19-induced apoptosis which results in presentation of self- 
antigens to T lymphocytes, and the phospholipase activity to the B19 unique VP1 protein 
region [23]. 
 
 
 
2.2 
Immune cell alterations 
 
Enhanced levels of immunoglobulins and alterations in B cells are frequently found in 
autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic  lupus  erythematosus 
(SLE) and primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) [27-30]. Further frequencies of CD21low B 
cells are frequently increased in these autoimmune diseases [27]. Consistently, alterations of 
B cell subsets are reported in ME/CFS. Elevated numbers of CD21+ as well as CD19+ and 
activated CD5+ B cells were described in ME/CFS patients [31, 32]. Bradley et al. showed 
enhanced frequencies of naïve and transitional B cells and diminished plasma blasts [33]. 
Differently, Brenu et al. did not observe an altered frequency of plasma blasts, but an 
increase of memory B cells [34]. However, no major alteration of major B cell subpopulations 
was observed in other studies [3, 35]. Mensah et al. reported an increase in CD24+ B cells, a 
fraction found to be elevated in autoimmune diseases [35]. Further elevated IgG levels in a 
subset of ME/CFS patients were shown in several studies [3, 35, 36]. Recently, a whole 
blood gene expression study discovered a downregulation of genes being involved in B cell 
differentiation and survival in ME/CFS [37]. 
T cell activation by infections could play an important role in the onset of autoimmune 
diseases [38]. In ME/CFS individuals, an increased frequency of activated T cells expressing 
the activation marker CD26 and HLA-DR has been shown, concomitant to lower levels of 
CD45RA+CD4+ T cells [31]. Similarly, ME/CFS was associated with higher frequencies of 
CD38 and HLA-DR co-expressing CD8+ T cells [39]. However, other authors found similar or 
lower expression of these markers in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy individuals [40, 
41]. Similarly, there is also evidence for a decreased cytotoxicity of CD 8+ T cells in a subset 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
8 
 
of ME/CFS patients [42-45]. Of particular interest in autoimmune diseases are T follicular 
helper cells (Tfh) that induce humoral responses at the germinal centers [46], the anti- 
inflammatory regulatory T cells (Treg) and the inflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) cells that 
modulate the activity of autoimmune responses [47]. The frequency of Treg has been 
addressed by several authors, most of them reporting a paradoxical higher frequency of this 
cell population in ME/CFS [40, 42, 48]. However, no studies on the potential role of Tfh and 
Th17 cells are available in ME/CFS yet. 
In contrast to inconsistent B and T cell alterations reported in ME/CFS, diminished numbers 
of circulating NK cells and reduction of their cytotoxic activity were uniformly shown [31, 40, 
49]. However, enhanced secretion of IFNand TNFby the immunoregulatory CD56 bright 
NK cell subset was described in ME/CFS [49, 50]. 
In summary, immune dysfunction in ME/CFS, as for other autoimmune disease, is a 
multifaceted hallmark that requires further studies using new technologies, standardized 
assays and well defined cohorts to clearly define common patterns. 
 
 
 
2.3 
Autoantibodies in ME/CFS 
 
Several studies described autoantibodies in ME/CFS mostly against nuclear and membrane 
structures and neurotransmitter receptors (Table 1).

Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were found in one study in 68 % of ME/CFS patients with the 
majority directed against the nuclear envelope [51]. Further studies showed ANA in 68%, 
57%, 23% and 13% of ME/CFS patients [52-55]. Ortega-Hernandez et al. found dsDNA 
antibodies in 12% of patients [56], but another study failed to show such antibodies in 
ME/CFS (0.7%) [57]. 
Klein and Berg described anti-ganglioside antibodies in ME/CFS patients, but not in healthy 
controls [58]. In addition, they and others found phospholipid autoantibodies in ME/CFS

patients in two studies [59, 60] but only in 4% in another study [56]. Further autoantibodies

respectively [56].

Antibodies against the muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were reported in 
ME/CFS patients and were associated with muscle weakness [54]. Evidence for a functional 
role of these antibodies comes from a PET study showing reduced binding of a M AChR 
ligand in brain in antibody positive ME/CFS patients [61]. Antibodies against ß1 and ß2 
adrenergic receptors (AdR) and M2/3 AChR were described in postural tachycardia 
syndrome, characterized by an increased heart rate in the absence of significant 
hypotension, as well as in orthostatic hypotension. This finding is of relevance for ME/CFS as 
11-40% of ME/CFS patients concurrently suffer from postural orthostatic tachycardia 
syndrome (POTS) [62-65]. In a study from our group, elevated autoantibodies against both 
ß2-AdR and M3/4 AChR were found in a subset of ME/CFS patients compared to healthy 
controls [53]. A high correlation was found between levels of ß2 AdR autoantibodies and 
elevated IgG1-3 subclasses, activated HLA-DR+ T cells and thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies 
and ANA. The association of ß2 AdR autoantibodies with immune markers suggests an 
activation of B and T cells expressing ß2 AdRs. Further, disturbance of the AdR and M AChR 
function may explain symptoms of autonomic dysregulation in ME/CFS. 
No differences between ME/CFS patients and controls were found in levels of autoantibodies 
directed against receptors for angiotensin, endothelin, mu-opioid, serotonin and dopamine 
[53, 54]. However, autoantibodies against serotonin have been associated with ME/CFS [56, 
58].

The IgM response against autoantigens formed by oxidative or nitrosative damage was 
studied by Maes et al. [66]. Autoantibodies directed against these neo-antigens, comprising 
oleic, palmitic and myristic acid, S-farnesyl-L-cysteine, by-products of lipid peroxidation, e.g. 
malondialdehyde, and N-oxide modified amino acids, e.g. nitro-tyrosine and nitro-tryptophan, 
were significantly higher in ME/CFS patients than in controls. In addition, they observed that 
the level of these autoantibodies correlates with severity of illness and symptoms. Although 
increased IgM antibodies against these oxidatively damaged antigens were shown in major 
depression, too, a higher immune response was found in ME/CFS [67]. 
 
 
 
2.4 
Soluble markers of autoimmunity 
 
Autoimmunity is associated with enhanced levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines 
playing an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases [68]. Elevated levels 
of cytokines related to Th1- as well as Th2-driven responses were reported for ME/CFS in 
several studies [42, 69-74]. Further cytokine levels in ME/CFS were associated with severity 
and duration of illness [72-74]. However, alterations in cytokine profiles in ME/CFS were not 
found in all studies [75, 76]. 
Elevated levels of B lymphocyte activating factor (BAFF) were described in a variety of 
autoimmune diseases including RA, SLE and pSS [77]. BAFF regulates the survival and 
maturation of B cells and mediates the IL-10 production of regulatory B cells [78, 79]. 
Elevated levels of BAFF were shown in a subset of patients with ME/CFS in comparison to 
healthy controls [80]. As the gene expression of the BAFF receptor (TNFRSF13C) is reduced 
in ME/CFS, increased serum BAFF levels may represent a compensatory mechanism [37]. 
Interestingly, elevated serum BAFF levels correlated with the autoantibody production in RA, 
SLE and pSS [81]. In ME/CFS an association between BAFF and autoantibodies was not 
described so far. 
Activin A and B, members of the Transforming Growth Factor β family, are involved in the 
control of inflammation and muscle mass [82]. Elevated levels of activin B as well as an 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
11 
 
elevated ratio of activin A or B to the binding protein follostatin in ME/CFS patients were 
demonstrated in a recent study [83]. An association of increased activin A with inflammatory 
bowel disease, RA, and asthma was already shown [82]. 
CD26 is a peptide-cleaving enzyme associated with immune regulation. In various 
autoimmune diseases, such as MS, Grave’s disease, and RA increased numbers of CD26 T 
cells were found in inflamed tissues and peripheral blood [84]. Fletcher et al. reported a 
higher frequency of CD26 expressing CD2+ lymphocytes in ME/CFS, but a decreased 
expression level on T and NK cells [85]. Further, they observed a reduction of the soluble 
CD26. Reduced serum CD26 levels were also reported for SLE and RA showing an inverse 
correlation with disease activity [84]. Low CD26 expression on PBMCs in ME/CFS was 
shown to correlate with reduced post-exercise muscle action potential, increased exercise- 
mediated lipid peroxidation, reduced quality of life and enhanced pain [86]. 
Other serum factors, frequently elevated in autoimmune disease like sCD30, sCD23, soluble 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (sCTLA-4) or the soluble IL-2 receptor (sIl-2R) 
are not described in ME/CFS so far [87-92]. 
 
 
 
2.5 
Genetic variants associated with autoimmunity 
 
It is well established that certain HLA alleles are associated with autoimmune diseases. 
Smith et al. showed an increased prevalence of the class II major histocompatibility complex 
HLA-DQB1*01 allele in ME/CFS patients [93]. Two others variants of HLA-DQB1 in 
combination with two RAGE-374A variants were associated with ME/CFS [94]. In another 
study the interaction of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their HLA class I 
epitopes were studied. An excess of KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1 missing their HLA-Bw4Ile80 
binding motif was shown in ME/CFS, leading potentially to an ongoing activation [95]. 
In the last years, genome-wide association studies revealed variants of various genes with 
either gain- or loss-of-function that are associated with the risk to develop autoimmune 
diseases. These single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in receptors, enzymes or 
transcription factors  play  a  role  in B cell  activation,  T  cell  development,  activation  and 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

 proliferation, and cytokine signaling which are crucial in autoimmune diseases [96-100]. 
Further, it is becoming increasingly clear that elements of the non‐coding genome regulate a 
 
variety of normal immune functions and that dysregulation of enhancer elements or long non- 
coding RNA may play a key role in autoimmunity [101]. So far only polymorphisms  in 
cytokine as well as toll-like receptor signaling pathways and complement cascade were 
studied showing an association with ME/CFS [102, 103]. Due to its regulation of the 
inflammatory response the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 has gained interest. Several 
variants (SNPs) within NR3C1 gene were shown to be significantly associated with ME/CFS 
[104, 105]. 
 
 
 
2.6 
Energy metabolism and autoimmunity 
 
Immunometabolism represents the interface between immunology and metabolism and is an 
exciting emerging field of research in autoimmunity [106-108]. The metabolic requirements of 
immune cells depend on their state of resting or activation and differentiation. Their activation 
results in a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis in order to provide enough energy and bio- 
precursors to meet the requirements  for supporting rapid cell proliferation and immune 
functions. A growing body of evidence suggests that energy metabolism is crucial for the 
maintenance of chronic inflammation, not only in terms of energy supply but also in the 
control of the immune response through metabolic signals [106, 107]. It has been suggested 
that disturbances in this intricate metabolic-immune cross-talk may be closely linked with and 
contribute to autoimmunity, although the precise pathomechanisms involved still remain to be 
elucidated [107, 108]. It is also striking that several glycolytic enzymes act as autoantigens in 
rheumatic inflammatory disorders [109], although their role in ME/CFS remains unclear. 
The profound and debilitating fatigue experienced by ME/CFS individuals led to the 
hypothesis that energy metabolism may be dysregulated. Defects in mitochondrial function in 
ME/CFS were shown in various studies from our group and others [110-113]. Metabolic 
profile had revealed disturbances related to energy, amino acids, nucleotides, nitrogen 
metabolism and oxidative stress in ME/CFS [114-119]. A metabolic shift toward aerobic 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
13 
 
glycolysis resulting in insufficient tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and inadequate ATP 
production was reported recently, although the underlying basis has yet to be established 
[116, 119]. Interestingly, the 2016 Fluge et al. study points to a secondary metabolic change 
driven by a serum factor in ME/CFS patients [116]. 
As dysfunctional metabolic pathways can directly influence and exacerbate defective 
immune responses, establishing the bioenergetic metabolism status of the different subsets 
of immune cells in ME/CFS has become a topic of increasing interest. 
 
 
 
2.7. Comorbidity with autoimmune diseases 
 
Comorbidity of ME/CFS with various autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases including 
fibromyalgia (FM), Hashimoto's thyroiditis and POTS is observed (Fig. 2). Especially for FM 
there is considerable overlap with up to 77% of patients fulfilling disease criteria for both 
ME/CFS and FM [120]. FM is characterized by chronic widespread pain and is common in 
autoimmune diseases with around 50% of prevalence in patients with RA and SLE [121, 
122]. According to the modified ACR 2010 criteria FM has an overall estimated prevalence of 
5.4%. In a recent study from our group analyzing clinical subgroups in a large Spanish 
ME/CFS cohort was reported FM comorbidity ranging from 26% to 91% [123]. In another 
study including patient cohorts from Norway, UK and USA, a comorbidity for ME/CFS and 
FM of 30% was observed [124]. In a similar manner Hashimoto's thyroiditis characterized by 
elevated antibodies against thyroid peroxidase is frequent in autoimmune disease, whereas 
the overall prevalence is around 0.8% in the general population [125]. Hashimoto's thyroiditis 
is found in 17-20 % in ME/CFS patients [53, 123]. Moreover, 11-40% of ME/CFS patients 
suffer from POTS [62-65]. Interestingly, for both disorders elevated frequencies of 
autoantibodies directed against AdRs and M AChRs were shown [53, 126-128]. Furthermore, 
a substantial number of ME/CFS patients have a family history of autoimmune diseases 
[129, 130].

3. Therapies targeting autoimmunity in ME/CFS 
 
First clear evidence for a pathogenic role of autoantibodies in ME/CFS comes from two 
clinical trials with the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab [129, 131]. Upon depletion of 
CD20+ B cells with rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the B cell surface 
protein CD20, approximately 60% of patients experienced a partial or complete, and in some 
patients sustained clinical remission (Table 2). The delayed onset of response with a median 
of approximately 4 months in both trials suggests that clinical effects are not directly 
mediated by depletion of CD20+ B cells, but by diminishing short-lived antibody-producing 
plasma cells arising from CD20+ memory B cells, followed by subsequent wash-out of 
autoantibodies. Results from a multicenter controlled trial with rituximab are awaited in spring 
2018. 
Few other treatment modalities targeting autoimmunity were evaluated in clinical trials in 
ME/CFS (Table 2). High dose intravenous IgG therapy is efficacious in autoantibody- 
mediated diseases. Several intravenous IgG studies were performed in ME/CFS during the 
80’s with two randomized controlled trials with positive and two with a negative outcome 
[132]. Preliminary data from an ongoing trial in Norway with cyclophosphamide suggests 
therapeutic efficacy of this broadly immunosuppressive drug [Fluge et al., unpublished data]. 
Immunoadsorption is an apheresis in which IgG is specifically removed from plasma resulting 
in clinical improvement in various types of autoimmune disease. We performed a pilot trial in 
10 patients with ME/CFS and observed first evidence for efficacy [Scheibenbogen et al., 
unpublished data]. 
 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
There is compelling evidence that autoimmune mechanisms play a role in ME/CFS. However 
clinical heterogeneity in disease onset (infection versus non-infection triggered), presence of 
immune-associated symptoms, and divergent immunological alterations point to the 
existence of subgroups of ME/CFS patients with possibly different pathomechanisms. 
Therefore, it is important to identify clinically useful diagnostic markers to select patients with

autoimmune-mediated disease for clinical trials. The search for autoantibodies is of great 
importance enabling to develop potential biomarkers for diagnosis and providing a rationale 
for therapeutic interventions. Encouraging results from first clinical trials warrant larger 
studies with rituximab and other strategies targeting autoantibodies.

Figure 1: Potential pathomechanism of ME/CFS. 
 
Dysregulation of immune system, autonomic nervous system (ANS) and metabolic 
disturbances contribute to this complex syndrome, in which severe fatigue and cognitive 
impairment are core features. In most patients, disease onset is triggered by infection with 
stress, immune deficiency and autoimmunity as known risk factors.

Highlights 
 
 
The pathogenesis of ME/CFS is multifactorial, and immunological and environmental 
factors play a role. 
 
Autoimmune mechanisms can be linked with ME/CFS at least in a subset of patients. 
 
 
Autoantibodies mostly against nuclear and neurotransmitter receptors are found in a 
subset of ME/CFS patients. 
Immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies targeting autoantibodies may be beneficial and 
should be pursued.
