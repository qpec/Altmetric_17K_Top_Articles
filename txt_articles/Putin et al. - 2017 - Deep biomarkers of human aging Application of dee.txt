INTRODUCTION 
 
Aging is a complex process affecting all biological 
systems at every level of organization [1, 2]. While 
many anti-aging interventions have demonstrated life-
extending or other geroprotective effects in model 
organisms,   practical   limitations  continue   to  hamper

translation to the clinic [3]. One problem is that the 
evaluation of aging changes and possible anti-aging 
remedies requires a comprehensive set of robust 
biomarkers [4] . Large-scale longitudinal programs like 
MARK-AGE [5] have been launched to analyze 
changes in multiple biomarkers during aging and 
correlation between biological and chronological age.

Abstract: One of the major impediments in human aging research is the absence of a comprehensive and actionable set
of biomarkers that may be targeted and measured to track the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. In this study, we
designed a modular ensemble of 21 deep neural networks (DNNs) of varying depth, structure and optimization to predict
human chronological age using a basic blood test. To train the DNNs, we used over 60,000 samples from common blood
biochemistry and cell count tests from routine health exams performed by a single laboratory and linked to chronological
age and sex. The best performing DNN in the ensemble demonstrated 81.5 % epsilon‐accuracy  r = 0.90 with R2 = 0.80 and
MAE = 6.07 years in predicting chronological age within a 10 year frame, while the entire ensemble achieved 83.5%
epsilon‐accuracy  r = 0.91 with R2 = 0.82 and MAE = 5.55 years. The ensemble also identified the 5 most important markers
for predicting human chronological age: albumin, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, urea and erythrocytes. To allow for public
testing and evaluate real‐life performance of the predictor, we developed an online system available at
http://www.aging.ai. The ensemble approach may facilitate integration of multi‐modal data linked to chronological age
and sex that may lead to simple, minimally invasive, and affordable methods of tracking integrated biomarkers of aging in
humans and performing cross‐species feature importance analysis.

 Several “aging clocks” able to predict human 
chronological age using various biomarkers have 
already been proposed. Methylation-based markers such 
as epigenetic aging clocks (Horvath [6] and Hannum 
[7]) 
are 
currently 
the 
most 
accurate, 
while 
transcriptomics [8,9] and metabolomics [10] have 
shown to be less so. Telomere length is commonly used 
to measure senescence but has lower predictive ability 
of human chronological age than IgG N-glycans, 
immunoglobulin G glycosylated at conservative N-
glycation sites [11]. Recent studies show that 
biomarkers of age-related pathologies could be used to 
evaluate senescence modifications based on the 
connection between age-related pathologies at the 
signaling pathway level [12]. 
 
However, 
most 
of 
these 
biomarkers 
are 
not 
representative of the health state of the entire organism 
or individual systems and are not easily measured or 
targeted with known interventions. The common blood 
biochemistry test is one of the simplest tests used by 
physicians to examine the health state of patients. While 
being highly variable in nature, some markers from 
blood biochemistry are sensitive indicators of various 
conditions, such as inflammation and even alcoholism, 
and are approved for clinical use [13, 14]. 
 
Machine learning (ML) techniques, such as support 
vector machines (SVM), are routinely used in 
biomarker development [15] and rapid increases in 
labeled data are enabling deep neural networks (DNNs). 
Methods based on deep architectures have outperformed 
classical approaches not only in image analysis, but also 
in solving a wide range of genomics, transcriptomics 
and proteomics problems [16].  
 
In this study, we apply a deep learning technique for 
predicting human chronological age that utilizes 
multiple DNNs stacked into an ensemble and trained on 
tens of thousands of blood biochemistry samples from 
patients undergoing routine physical examinations.  We 
then use a custom implementation of the permutation 
feature importance (PFI) technique [17] to evaluate the 
relative importance of each blood biochemistry marker 
to 
ensemble 
accuracy. 
We 
also 
analyzed 
the 
performance and accuracy of 40 DNN architectures 
optimized using a variety of optimizers, identified the 
best DNN, and selected 21 DNNs that cumulatively 
provided higher accuracy and ��as an ensemble than 
the best DNN in the ensemble.  
 
RESULTS 
 
To perform this study, we obtained a dataset of 62,419 
anonymized blood biochemistry records, where each 
record consists of a person’s age, sex, and 46 
standardized blood markers through a collaboration 
with one of the largest laboratory networks in Russia, 
Invitro Laboratory, Ltd. We aimed to draw data from 
a reasonably healthy population.  While we did not 
have access to patient records, we selected only blood 
tests from routine health checks, avoiding obvious 
sources of unhealthy patients, such as hospitals, and 
through statistical analysis omitted blood tests with 
outliers.   
 
The generalized project pipeline is depicted in Figure 
1. First, we preprocessed the blood test data set, 
excluding highly biased markers from reference 
ranges, normalizing them for training the DNNs, and 
removing outliers (see Methods for details). The 
resulting data set was split into training and test sets 
comprised of 56,177 and 6242 samples, respectively. 
Then 40 different DNNs were trained on 56,177 blood 
test samples.  
 
Since we treated human age prediction as a regression 
problem, we used two metrics to estimate the 
performance of the method: standard coefficient of 
determination 
(R2) 
and 
ε-prediction 
(epsilon-
prediction) accuracy (see Methods for details). When 
using epsilon-prediction accuracy, the sample is 
considered correctly recognized if the predicted age is 
in the range of [true age -ε; true age +ε], where ε 
controls the level of certainty in the prediction. So if ε = 
0, then it is a simple classification accuracy. In this 
study, we considered ε = 10. The key advantage of 
using epsilon-prediction accuracy is that it allows 
cohort analysis without fixed age ranges (e.g. 10-20, 20-
30). 
 
The best single DNN performed with 0.80 of R2 and 
82% within the 10 year frame of epsilon-prediction 
accuracy (Figure 2 A & B). Single DNN outperformed 
other ML models such as k-Nearest Neighbors, Support 
Vector Machine, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting 
Machine, etc (Figure 3  & B). 
 
To further increase the coefficient of determination 
and accuracy of predictions, we combined these single 
DNNs into an ensemble based on the stacked 
generalization (Stacking) technique [18]. Stacking is a 
method that fits some ML models on the predictions of 
other models, in our case on the predictions of DNNs. 
Model selection was performed with 10 fold cross-
validation and with the random search strategy for 
finding the best hyperparameters for considered 
models. The experiments with Stacking models 
showed (Figure 4 A & B) that the best ML model was 
ElasticNet.

To successfully combine the predictions of DNNs into 
the Stacking ensemble model, the predictions of DNNs 
should closely approximate the target variable and 
differ from one another, or be less correlated. To 
achieve this, DNNs should be trained with different 
hyperparameters, varying in the number of layers, 
counts of neurons in each layer, activation functions, 
regularization techniques, etc. We investigated 40 
DNNs, each unique in terms of hyperparameters. 
Pearson correlations of these DNNs are presented in a 
heat map on Figure 2 F, showing a high degree of 
similarity among many of the networks regarding 
predictions (r approaching 1) but also some major 
distinctions. 
 
To determine how many of these trained DNNs were 
necessary for constructing the Stacking ensemble 
model, we performed an iterative process of adding 
each DNN’s predictions vector into the ensemble. Two 
iterative strategies were employed: adding predictions 
by decreasing R2 of each network, i.e. adding better 
networks considering  R2 earliest  in  the  ensemble,  and  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increasing the correlation between DNNs, i.e. adding 
less correlated networks first. The results of this assay 
are presented in Figure S2. Both strategies showed that 
no more than 21 DNNs were needed in the ensemble. 
The ensemble resulting from distinguishing the 
correlations of DNNs and ordering the addition of 
DNNs into the ensemble demonstrated R2=0.82 and 
83,5% within a 10 year frame of epsilon-prediction 
accuracy (Figure 2 D & E). 
 
We compared our deep-learned predictor with several 
published epigenetics and transcriptomics markers of 
human age. Surprisingly, despite the fact that we used 
only blood biochemistry data with 41 values for each 
patient, 
our 
biomarker 
outperformed 
blood 
transcriptomics biomarkers presented by Peters et al 
with R2=0,6 for the best model [8]. Due to the nature of 
the data, epigenetics markers show a stronger 
correlation with chronological age, with R2=0,93 for 
Horvath's methylation clock and R2=0,89 for the 
Hannum et methylation clock [6, 7]. 
Figure 1. Project pipeline. Laboratory blood biochemistry data sets were normalized and cleaned of outliers
and some abnormal markers. For biological age prediction, 21 different DNNs with different parameters were
combined in ensemble based on ElasticNet model. For biological sex prediction, single DNN were trained.

 Marker importance 
 
In order to analyze the importance of blood test markers 
via neural networks, some wrapper feature (selection) 
importances approaches are required. We used a 
modification of the Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) 
method (see Methods for details). By applying this 
method, one receives  a  list  sorted  by  the  importance  of  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
markers via DNN. This technique has two benefits: 1) it is 
native and simple to interpret and 2) as other wrapper 
methods it relies on DNN performance, which in this case 
is better than other ML models, thus produces more robust 
and meaningful features. Marker importance analysis by 
PFI method, the results of which are presented in Figure 2 
C, reveals the five important markers: albumin, glucose, 
alkaline phosphatase, urea, and erythrocytes.

Top features 
 
We also performed so-called top features analysis, 
which answers how the performance of a single DNN 
will decrease as the number of markers used in the 
model decreases. To select the smaller number of 
markers for training the DNN, the sorted list of all PFI 
scores is used. The results of this analysis for both R2 
and epsilon-prediction accuracy are presented on Figure 
5 A & B. For the top 10 features by PFI, the DNN got 
R2=0.63 and 70% of 10 year frame epsilon-accuracy 
prediction. In practical terms, the fact that this drop in 
performance was so small supports the top 10 markers 
received by PFI as robust and reliable features for 
predicting age. 
 
Use case 
 
To make this deep network ensemble available to the 
public, we placed our system online (www.Aging.AI), 
allowing any patient with blood test data to predict their 
age and sex. In order to validate our approach, we 
collected the blood biochemistry reports that were 
uploaded on the site from 25 January to 15 March 2016.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The total number of collected reports with indicated 
real age was 1,563 samples. Many users expressed no 
desire to specify all 41 parameters of the blood test, so 
we added an option to enter only the 10 most 
important markers. The average number of missing 
values provided by the volunteer testers was 18.5 
markers per person. There are several strategies for 
filling skipped values, including zero, mean, mode and 
median over all values of each marker. Evaluation of 
these 4 strategies on the aging.ai data showed that 
median filling strategy has the best performance in 
terms of both R2 and epsilon-prediction accuracy 
(Figure 4 C & D).  
 
Aging.AI provides a proof of concept for a simple and 
inexpensive blood-based predictor of chronological age, 
which may be used for speculate on the biological age 
of the patient. However, it has many limitations. When 
it comes to developing predictors using deep neural 
networks, one of the major difficulties is building large 
data sets. In this study we were constrained by the 
limited number of features available to us in large 
numbers of blood test results. Some of the features, for 
example globulin fractures, are no longer frequently 
Figure 3. DNNs outperform baseline ML approaches in terms of R2 statistics. DNN were compared with 7 ML 
techniques: GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine), RF (Random Forests), DT (Decision Trees), LR (Linear Regression), kNN
(k‐Nearest Neighbors), ElasticNet, SVM (Support Vector Machines). (A) GBM shows the higher 0,72 R2 among ML 
models for biological age prediction. (B) All ML models have comparable high R2 for biological sex prediction.

DISCUSSION 
 
Aging is a complex process and occurs at different rates 
and to different extents in the various organ systems, 
including respiratory, renal, hepatic, and metabolic [19, 
20]. The analysis of relative feature importance within 
the DNNs helped deduce the most important features 
that may shed light on the contribution of these systems 
to the aging process, ranked in the following order: 
metabolic, liver, renal system and respiratory function. 
The five markers related to these functions were 
previously associated with aging and used to predict 
human biological age [21, 22]. Another interesting 
finding was the extraordinarily high importance of 
albumin, which primarily controls the oncotic pressure 
of blood. Albumin declines during aging and is 
associated with sarcopenia [23]. The second marker by 
relative importance is glucose, which is directly linked 
to metabolic health. Cardiovascular diseases associated 
with diabetes mellitus are major causes of death within 
the general population [24].  
 
Our approach of using an ensemble of DNNs 
outperformed other ML models in terms of R2 and 
epsilon-prediction accuracy (Figure 3 A & B).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Application of DNNs uncovered complex nonlinear 
interactions between markers resulting in robust 
ensemble performance. This ensemble  may also be 
expanded with DNNs trained on different sources and 
types of biological data allowing for complex multi-
modal markers to be created and relative contributions 
of each input analyzed.  
 
Current and future directions of this work include 
adding 
other 
sources 
of 
features 
including 
transcriptomic and metabolomics markers from blood, 
urine, individual organ biopsies and even imaging data 
as well as testing the system using data from patients 
with accelerated aging syndromes, multiple diseases 
and performing gender-specific analysis. Similar tests 
may be performed by research teams working on rare 
diseases or working with athletic groups by using 
http://www.Aging.AI system or contacting the authors 
to perform a high-throughput analysis. Developing 
similar systems for model organisms and performing 
PFI analysis may help perform cross-species analysis 
and of the relative importance of individual markers and 
organ 
systems 
in 
predicting 
chronological 
and 
biological age.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Data. Anonymized statistical data of human blood tests 
was kindly provided by an independent laboratory, 
Invitro (www.Invitro.ru). No patient records were used 
in the study. In total, the data contains 62419 records 
where each record consists of person’s age and 46 
standardized 
blood 
markers, 
such 
as 
Glucose, 
Cholesterol, 
Alpha-1-globulins, 
etc. 
(Table 
S1) 
Histograms of human age for training sets and 
descriptive statistics of top 10 blood markers used in the 
research are depicted in the Figure S1 A.  
 
One can see from the Figure S1 B that minimum and 
maximum values of each marker are far distributed 
from their normal range values. This distribution 
reflects patients’ tendencies to self-report symptoms and 
test their health with professional health-care services 
only in complex cases, which affects their health 
condition and thus test results [25]. Moreover, we found 
that there were no patients that could be considered as 
healthy and who have blood test values within a 
reference range. The most frequently abnormal markers 
in the distribution were white blood cell count markers: 
basophils, abs., eosinophils, abs., lymphocytes abs. 
monocytes, abs,  neutrophils, abs.   These types of test 
provide the total number (absolute number, abs.) of 
white blood cells in blood microliter. Here, this routine 
analysis was conducted using a hematology automated 
analyzer, which counts cells precisely with low error 
rate [26]. In this case, these aberrant values of markers 
are more likely linked to the major function of white 
blood cells; immune function, infections, allergies, 
smoking [27] or even sleep duration [28] could affect 
the rate of white blood cells. Additionally, recent 
studies show a connection between metabolic diseases 
such as diabetes and range of white blood cells [29, 30].  
For this reason, levels of basophils, eosinophils, 
lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils are extremely 
variable in the general population. To prevent DNN 
predictions from being highly biased with respect to 
abnormal ranges of blood markers, we excluded these 5 
markers. Processed data was presented in a tabular 
format of 62419 rows and 42 columns (age and sex + 41 
markers). 
 
Then, specifically for training deep neural network, we 
normalized all blood markers to 0-1 range by using the 
formula: 
�0�1 �
� � ����
���� � ����
 
 
where � is the origin values of each blood marker, ���� 
and ����are its minimum and maximum, respectively 
and �0�1 is the marker within 0-1 range. 
We split the data to the training and test sets with 90/10 
ratio. Thus, the size of training and test sets were 56177 
and 6242 samples, respectively. The DNN was built by 
adjusting its hyperparameters (such as a number of 
layers, activation function, etc.) on the training set and 
measuring the performance of the trained neural 
network on the test set.  The comparison of 
performances of 6 best DNNs with different values of 
hyperparameters is depicted on Table S1. All 
experiments were conducted on Nvidia Tesla K80 
graphics processing unit. 
 
There are two reasons why in the study we treated the 
prediction of human age as a regression problem: 1) age 
has natural order, so it is an order variable and 2) one 
may be interested in the difference in values of the 
markers with difference in ages, which is the natural 
way to perform the analysis of marker influence. In this 
case, it was better to use regression instead of 
classification methods. 
 
So, in all evaluations 4 metrics were measured:  
1. 
�, which is a Pearson’s correlation coefficient 
defined as: � �
∑
������������
��
�
���
�∑
��������
�
���
�∑
�����
���
�
���
; where  �� is 
real value and �� is the mean of �,  �� is predicted value 
and  �
� is the mean of �, and � is number of samples. 
2. 
�2, which is a standard coefficient of 
determination defined as: �2 �
∑
��������
�
��1
∑
�����
���
�
��1
; where �� is 
the real value, �
� is the predicted value and �
� is the 
mean of  �. 
3. 
Mean absolute error (MAE), which is defined 
as ��� �
�
� ∑
|�
� � ��|
�
���
; where �
� is a prediction of 
the model, �� is a true value and N is a number of 
samples. 
4. 
�-prediction 
accuracy 
defined 
as: 
� �
���������� �
∑
�
�
��1
�����
�
; where A is ��� � �; �� � ��; 
��is the real value, �
�is the predicted value and � is a 
parameter that controls the range of correctness of 
predictions. So for example if � is 10 and the true value 
of age is 45 the deep neural network correctly 
recognized sample if it is in the [35, 55] range. 
 
Feature importance method. The idea behind the 
algorithm stemmed from the feature randomization 
technique used in Random Forest (RF) [31]. PFI 
computes significance scores for all features by 
determining the accuracy of a model to random 
permutations of the values of those feature variables. 
The main underlying assumption is that permuting the 
values of important features results in a more significant 
reduction in a model's performance compared to the

 effect of less important ones. But when cross-validation 
is not performed, one should improve the robustness of 
the method.  
 
To do this, we shuffled each feature � times and then 
computed the average PFI score for the feature, 
concretely the PFI score for one feature is defined as 
follows: 
���
������� � ������
�
�
�
� ∑
��������
�
�
���
; where ������
�
 is 
a total �� for the model without any permutations and 
��������
�
 is a �� for the model with permutated feature 
permutated feature and K is a parameter that controls 
how many times the feature is permutated. 
 
Note that PFI is a wrapper method, so it would 
significantly depend on applying ML model, but 
because DNNs show better performance than other ML 
models, it was suitable for the problem. 
 
Architecture of DNN. We used simple feed-forward 
neural 
networks 
trained 
with 
the 
standard 
backpropagation algorithm as our deep (more than 3 
layers) learning models. For each DNN in the resulting 
ensemble, multiple hyperparameters were adjusted, 
including the number of hidden layers, the number of 
neurons in each layer, choice of activation function, 
choice of optimization method, and regularization 
techniques. The table with experiments of different 
hyperparameters for the DNNs are presented in Table 
S1. 
 
The best DNN in the ensemble had 5 hidden layers with 
2000, 1500, 1000, 500, and 1 neurons in each, 
respectively. The last layer, with one neuron, 
corresponds to regression output. The optimization loss 
function was simple mean squared error (MSE) with 
regularization terms. The DNN used PReLU activation 
function [32] in each layer, AdaGrad [33] as optimizer 
of the loss function, Dropout [34] with probability of 
0.2 after each layer, and l2 weight decay [35]. To 
further cope with over fitting and make more stable 
convergence of models, we used Batch normalization 
technique [36] after the first 2 layers.
