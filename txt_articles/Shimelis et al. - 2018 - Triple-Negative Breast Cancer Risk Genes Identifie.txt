Abstract
Background: Germline genetic testing with hereditary cancer gene panels can identify women at increased risk of breast
cancer. However, those at increased risk of triple-negative (estrogen receptor–negative, progesterone receptor–negative, hu-
man epidermal growth factor receptor–negative) breast cancer (TNBC) cannot be identified because predisposition genes for
TNBC, other than BRCA1, have not been established. The aim of this study was to define the cancer panel genes associated
with increased risk of TNBC.
Methods: Multigene panel testing for 21 genes in 8753 TNBC patients was performed by a clinical testing laboratory, and
testing for 17 genes in 2148 patients was conducted by a Triple Negative Breast Cancer Consortium (TNBCC) of research
studies. Associations between deleterious mutations in cancer predisposition genes and TNBC were evaluated using results
from TNBC patients and reference controls.
Results: Germline pathogenic variants in BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51D were associated with high risk (odds
ratio > 5.0) of TNBC and greater than 20% lifetime risk for overall breast cancer among Caucasians. Pathogenic variants in
BRIP1, RAD51C, and TP53 were associated with moderate risk (odds ratio > 2) of TNBC. Similar trends were observed for the
African American population. Pathogenic variants in these TNBC genes were detected in 12.0% (3.7% non-BRCA1/2) of all
participants.
Conclusions: Multigene hereditary cancer panel testing can identify women with elevated risk of TNBC due to mutations in
BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51D. These women can potentially benefit from improved screening, risk
management, and cancer prevention strategies. Patients with mutations may also benefit from specific targeted therapeutic
strategies.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype
defined by absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone re-
ceptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) expression (1). TNBC accounts for an estimated 15% of
breast cancer in the Caucasian population and 35% in the
African American population (2). TNBC is associated with

 advanced disease stage and higher-grade tumors at diagnosis
(1) and is associated with an increased recurrence risk and poor
five-year survival rates relative to other breast cancers (3).
Germline genetic testing of TNBC patients using hereditary can-
cer gene panels is now common practice because of the high
frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and the identification
of
non–BRCA1/2
predisposition
gene
mutations
in
5%
of
TNBC patients unselected for age of diagnosis or family history
(4), and in 4.5% of TNBC patients receiving clinical genetic
testing (5).
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines
recommend BRCA1/2 testing for patients meeting hereditary
breast and ovarian cancer testing criteria or with a TNBC diag-
nosis at age 60 years or younger. However, recommendations
for testing of other genes are not fully established because the
risks of TNBC associated with mutations in cancer predisposi-
tion genes have not been established. Thus, a better under-
standing of gene-specific risks for TNBC is needed to identify
the genes that should be tested in the setting of TNBC. This
should lead to improved clinical management of individuals at
risk for or diagnosed with this aggressive form of breast cancer.
We present germline genetic testing results from two cohorts of
TNBC patients and provide estimated TNBC risk associated with
pathogenic variants in 21 cancer predisposition genes.
Methods
Study Population
This study involved 10 901 TNBC patients, including 8753 from a
cohort of 140 449 individuals subjected to clinical germline can-
cer panel testing between March 2012 and June 2016 at a clinical
testing
laboratory
(Ambry
Genetics,
Aliso
Viejo,
CA).
Demographic, clinical, and family history information, as well
as TNBC status based on histopathology markers, was provided
by
the
ordering
physician
(Supplementary
Methods
and
Supplementary Figure 1, available online) (6). The clinical test-
ing study was approved by the Western Institutional Review
Board. In addition, results from a previous study of 2148 TNBC
patients
by
a
Triple-Negative
Breast
Cancer
Consortium
(TNBCC)
using
a
17-gene
panel
(4)
were
included
(Supplementary Methods, available online). All TNBCC patients
provided informed consent for institutional review board–ap-
proved studies.
Multigene Panel Testing
Germline genetic testing results for 21 genes (BRCA1, BRCA2,
PALB2, BARD1, BRIP1, NF1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, CDKN2A, RAD51C,
RAD51D, RAD50, NBN, MRE11A, ATM, CHEK2, TP53, PTEN, STK11,
CDH1) from the clinically tested cohort of TNBC patients were
evaluated. Testing was performed by targeted custom capture
and sequencing and chromosomal rearrangement analysis
(Supplementary Methods, available online) (6). A five-tier classi-
fication system was applied to all alterations (6), and variants
from Ambry Genetics were subsequently submitted to ClinVar.
Analysis of 17 predisposition genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2,
BARD1, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D, RAD50, NBN, MRE11A, XRCC2,
ATM, CHEK2, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1) in 2148 TNBCC patients,
unselected for age of diagnosis, family history, or ethnicity, was
performed
by
custom
capture
panel
and
sequencing
(Supplementary Methods, available online) (4).
Comparison of TNBC Patient and ExAC Reference
Control Subjects
The combined frequencies of pathogenic variants and likely
pathogenic variants (PVs) in each of 21 genes in TNBC patients
from the clinical cohort and 17 genes in TNBC patients from
the TNBCC study were compared with PV frequency in more
than 26 000 non-Finnish European population (NFE) Exome
Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) reference control subjects (7),
excluding
The
Cancer
Genome
Atlas
(TCGA)
exomes
(Supplementary Methods, available online) (8,9). Both PASS
and non-PASS variants in ExAC (GATK Variant Quality Score
Recalibration [VQSR] sensitivity of 99.6% and 95%, respectively)
were utilized because many non-PASS variants from ExAC
were observed as PVs in TNBC patients. All loss of function and
missense variants with consensus definitions as “pathogenic”
by clinical laboratories in ClinVar were included. The frequen-
cies of PVs by gene in African American TNBC patients from
the clinical cohort were compared with frequencies in Genome
Aggregation Database (gnomAD) African and African American
reference
control
subjects
(gnomAD_AFR)
(Supplementary
Methods, available online).
Statistical Analysis
Associations between combined PVs in each gene and pheno-
typic characteristics of TNBC patients and age of diagnosis were
assessed using the Fisher exact test and the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov
test,
respectively.
Association
studies
compared
summed PV frequency in Caucasian and African American
TNBC patients for each gene with ExAC-NFE non-TCGA and
gnomAD AFR, respectively. A P value of less than .05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) were based on the Fisher exact test. Genes
were categorized as high risk (OR > 5.0), moderate risk (OR ¼
2.0–5.0), or low clinical relevance (OR < 2.0). Enrichment of
mutations by gene in TNBC relative to all non-TNBC breast can-
cers was estimated by logistic regression, with adjustment for
age of diagnosis and family history of breast cancer. Lifetime
absolute risk for TNBC and overall breast cancer were estimated
by combining the odds ratio estimates with age-adjusted sub-
type-specific
incidence
rates
from
the
Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry in the competing
risk component of the absolute risk equation (Supplementary
Methods, available online). False discovery rate–adjusted P val-
ues were calculated as previously described (10). All statistical
tests were two-sided.
Results
Characteristics of Study Population
Among the 8753 TNBC patients from the clinical cohort, 5498
(62.8%) were Caucasian and 1271 (14.5%) were African American
(Table 1; Supplementary Table 1, available online). In contrast,
2095 (97.5%) from the TNBCC cohort were Caucasian (Table 1).
The mean age (range) at diagnosis was 49.8 (18–90) years for the
clinical cohort and 50.8 (20–93) years for the TNBCC cohort
(Table 1). In addition, 51.9% of the clinical cohort but only 21.9%
of the 2148 TNBCC patients reported a first- or second-degree
relative with breast cancer (Table 1).

 Pathogenic Variants Identified by Panel Testing
From the clinical cohort, PVs in all 21 genes were detected in
14.4% (8.4% BRCA1/2, 6.0% non-BRCA) of TNBC patients of any
race or ethnicity, 14.0% (7.8% BRCA1/2, 6.2% non-BRCA) of
Caucasians,
and 14.6% (9.0% BRCA1/2, 5.6% non-BRCA) of
African Americans (Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Tables 1 and
2, available online). Of the 2148 TNBCC patients, 14.5% (10.4%
BRCA1/2, 4.0% non-BRCA) had PVs in 17 genes (Supplementary
Table 2, available online). PALB2 (1.0%–1.6%) and BARD1 (0.5%–
0.7%) were the most commonly mutated non-BRCA1/2 genes in
the clinical cohort and TNBCC study (Table 2; Supplementary
Table 2, available online). Characteristics of TNBC patients with
PVs are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 3
(available online).
Associations Between PVs and TNBC
Comparison of Caucasian TNBC patients from the clinical co-
hort and the TNBCC study with ExAC NFE non-TCGA reference
control subjects showed that BRCA1 PVs were associated with
high risk of TNBC, consistent with previous studies (Table 3).
Similarly, BRCA2 PVs were associated with high risk (OR > 5.0)
of TNBC in both the clinical cohort (OR ¼ 5.42, 95% CI ¼ 4.13 to
7.05, P < 2.2�10-16) and the TNBCC study (OR ¼ 6.33, 95% CI ¼
4.48 to 8.92, P < 2.2�10-16) (Table 3). Likewise, PVs in PALB2 (OR
¼ 14.41, 95% CI ¼ 9.27 to 22.60, P < 2.2�10-16), BARD1 (OR ¼ 5.92,
95% CI ¼ 3.36 to 10.27, P ¼ 2.2�10-9), and RAD51D (OR ¼ 6.97, 95%
CI ¼ 2.60 to 18.66, P ¼ 3.1�10-4), were shown to be statistically
significantly associated with high risk of TNBC in the clinical co-
hort (Table 3). PVs in BRIP1 and RAD51C, both of which were pre-
viously excluded as breast cancer predisposition genes (6,11,12),
were associated with moderate risk (OR > 2) of TNBC. PVs in
NF1 were not statistically significantly associated with moder-
ate risk of TNBC in the clinical cohort after adjustment for mul-
tiple testing (Supplementary Table 4, available online). PVs in
MSH6 were associated with moderate risk of TNBC in this study,
consistent with a twofold increased risk of overall breast cancer
(standardized incidence ratio ¼ 2.11, 95% CI ¼ 1.56 to 2.86) for
MSH6 PVs in a recent study (13), but the TNBC association was
not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing

 (Supplementary Table 4, available online). PVs in ATM, CHEK2,
NBN, and RAD50 yielded no clinically relevant risks (OR > 2) of
TNBC (Supplementary Table 4, available online). Similar associ-
ations with TNBC for all of these genes were observed in the
TNBCC study (Table 3; Supplementary Table 4, available online).
Risk estimates for most genes were not substantially altered
1)
when
using
gnomAD
Caucasian
control
subjects
(Supplementary Table 5, available online); 2) when using ExAC
PASS controls (Supplementary Table 6, available online); 3)
when restricting to patients with TNBC as the first cancer
(Supplementary Table 7, available online); and 4) when consid-
ering all races and ethnicities (Supplementary Table 8, available
online). Exclusion of TNBC patients with personal or family his-
tory
of
ovarian
or
colorectal
cancer
had
little
impact
(Supplementary Tables 9 and 10, available online), except for a
slightly attenuated association between RAD51C and TNBC (OR
¼ 1.96, 95% CI ¼ 0.93 to 4.07, P ¼ .09) when excluding ovarian
cancer (Supplementary Table 9, available online). Furthermore,
PVs in BRCA1, RAD51C, BARD1, and RAD51D were enriched more
than threefold in TNBC patients relative to all non-TNBC
patients, suggesting that these are predominantly TNBC predis-
position genes (Table 4). PALB2 and BRCA2 also displayed statis-
tically significant enrichment (Table 4).
PV Frequency in African American TNBC Patients
PVs in TNBC genes were identified in 12.7% of 1271 African
American TNBC patients, including 3.7% in non-BRCA genes
(Supplementary Table 2, available online). No major differences
in the PV frequencies in genes between African American and
Caucasian
TNBC
patients
were
observed
(Supplementary
Table 2, available online). An exploratory case–control analysis
of African American TNBC patients from the clinical cohort and
gnomAD-AFR suggested that PVs in BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1, and
PALB2 were statistically significantly associated with high or
moderate risk of TNBC (Supplementary Table 11, available on-
line). Similarly, RAD51C PVs were statistically significantly asso-
ciated with very high risk of TNBC, although these findings will
need to be replicated because of limited numbers of PVs in
TNBC patients and control subjects. Small numbers of PVs in
other genes yielded unstable estimates.
Frequency of PVs Based on Age of Onset and Family
History
PVs in moderate-risk and high-risk TNBC genes were observed
in 12.0% of TNBC patients from the clinical cohort and 13.2%
from TNBCC, including 3.7% in non-BRCA genes in both cohorts
(Table 2; Supplementary Table 2, available online). PV frequen-
cies varied based on age at diagnosis and total number of rela-
tives with breast or ovarian cancer among Caucasian and
African American TNBC patients (Table 5; and Supplementary
Table 12, available online, respectively). For example, PV fre-
quencies ranged from 5% in patients diagnosed older than age
60 years with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer to
35.3% in patients diagnosed younger than age 35 years with a
family history of ovarian cancer (Table 5). BRCA1 mutations
accounted for a larger proportion of early-onset TNBC whereas,
other TNBC genes accounted for a larger proportion of later-
onset TNBC. In addition, PVs in TNBC genes were identified in

 12.4% of TNBC patients from the clinical cohort meeting NCCN
BRCA1/2 testing criteria and in 4.3% of TNBC patients not meet-
ing criteria. When expanding to other breast cancer predisposi-
tion genes, overall detection of PVs increased to 13.1% and 4.6%,
respectively.
Absolute Risk Estimates for Breast Cancer and TNBC
When combining OR estimates for Caucasian TNBC patients
from the clinical cohort with age-adjusted subtype-specific inci-
dence rates from the SEER registry, BRCA1 and PALB2 PVs were
associated with 18% and 10% lifetime risks of TNBC, respec-
tively, followed by BARD1 (7%), BRCA2 (6%), and RAD51D (5%)
(Figure 1). Estimated TNBC risks contributed substantially to the
overall breast cancer risks for genes known to confer greater
than 20% lifetime risk for breast cancer (PALB2 56%, BRCA1 46%,
BRCA2 42%) (14,15) and to estimated absolute risks of 26% for
RAD51D and 21% in BARD1 (Figure 1). Similar exploratory studies
based on the African American population within the clinical
cohort suggested even greater contributions of TNBC risks to
greater than 20% lifetime risk estimates for overall breast cancer
for several genes (BRCA1 81%, BRCA2 62%, PALB2 41%, BARD1
39%) (Supplementary Figure 2, available online).
Discussion
This study of 10 901 TNBC patients from a cohort of TNBC
patients receiving clinical genetic testing and a separate series
of TNBC patients unselected for age of diagnosis or family his-
tory of breast or ovarian cancer is the first to establish which
cancer predisposition genes on multigene hereditary cancer
panels are associated with increased risk of TNBC. Consistent
with findings from an independent study of TNBC patients (5),
14.4% of TNBC patients in the clinical cohort had PVs in cancer
predisposition genes, whereas 12.0% had PVs in the eight TNBC
genes.
Among these TNBC predisposition genes, only BRCA1 has
been well characterized as a TNBC susceptibility gene, although
BARD1, BRIP1, PALB2, and RAD51C PVs have been reported as
enriched in TNBC relative to other breast cancer subtypes
(5,16,17). Results from this study further characterize the role of
these genes in TNBC and also introduce a novel association be-
tween RAD51D and risk for TNBC. Importantly, BRIP1, RAD51C,
and RAD51D have been primarily characterized by others as
ovarian rather than breast cancer susceptibility genes (18,19);
however, results from the present study strongly support an as-
sociation of these genes with TNBC. It is likely that this associa-
tion was undetected in some previous studies due to the rarity
of PVs in these genes among breast and breast/ovarian cancer
families, paired with the lower prevalence of TNBC relative to
other breast cancer subtypes.
Despite higher general population TNBC risk in African
Americans relative to Caucasians (1.91% vs 1.19%) (20), risk esti-
mates conferred by PVs in predisposition genes have not been
reported. Thus, although the analysis was limited by cohort
size, an exploratory association study using African American
TNBC patients and gnomAD AFR control subjects was under-
taken. Similar to the Caucasian population, statistically signifi-
cant associations between BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1, and PALB2 PVs
and TNBC were observed. Importantly, breast cancer absolute
risk estimates for patients with BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and
BARD1 PVs ranged from 40% to 80%, which may impact breast
cancer risk management decisions. However, larger studies of

 African American patients will be needed to develop more pre-
cise risk estimates. Interestingly, RAD51C PVs were associated
with high risk of TNBC in the African American population but
only moderate risk among Caucasians. Whether RAD51C is a
specific and important driver of TNBC in the African American
population, as suggested by high rates of epigenetic silencing of
the RAD51C promoter in African American basal tumors (21),
remains to be determined.
NCCN guidelines currently recommend BRCA1 and BRCA2
testing for individuals with TNBC diagnosed at age 60 years or
younger or who meet criteria based on personal and family can-
cer history. However, guidelines for non-BRCA predisposition
gene testing have not been established. In this study, PVs in
TNBC genes were identified in 4.3% of TNBC patients from the
clinical cohort not meeting NCCN BRCA1/2 testing criteria.
When considering all breast cancer predisposition genes, PVs

 were detected in 4.6% of patients. As most of these variants are
considered clinically actionable, these findings suggest that
testing criteria for TNBC patients should be expanded to include
testing of all breast cancer predisposition genes regardless of
age of diagnosis or family history of cancer.
Although absolute risks for TNBC in the general population
are low (1.19% in the Caucasian population; https://www.seer.
cancer.gov), PVs in TNBC predisposition genes substantially in-
creased breast cancer risk. Absolute risk models accounting for
risks of different subtypes of breast cancer identified five TNBC
predisposition
genes
(PALB2,
BRCA1,
BRCA2,
RAD51D,
and
BARD1) with greater than 20% lifetime risks for overall breast
cancer. Thus, the risk assessment and management of patients
with PVs in these genes should include some consideration of
the increased risk for TNBC. Although NCCN guidelines already
recommend additional breast cancer screening via magnetic
resonance imaging for women with PALB2, BRCA1, and BRCA2
PVs, the results from the current study provide evidence to sup-
port similar screening for patients with PVs in RAD51D and
BARD1. Continued study of gene-specific risks for breast cancer
subtypes may lead to tailored medical management recommen-
dations for PV carriers. Consistent with this hypothesis, initial
studies evaluating intensified screening in high-risk women
have suggested that a decrease in mortality from TNBC can be
achieved (22).
Although panel-based testing can identify unaffected women
at increased risk of TNBC and other cancers who can benefit
from risk management strategies, genetic testing can also iden-
tify individuals who may benefit from targeted therapeutic strat-
egies. In particular, results from the OlympiAD randomized trial
of the olaparib PARP inhibitor in HER2-negative metastatic breast
cancer patients suggested that BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers with
TNBC derived the greatest benefit from the PARP inhibitor in
combination with chemotherapy (hazard ratio ¼ 0.43, 95% CI ¼
0.29 to 0.63) (23). Moreover, a recent analysis of TNBC patients
from the Geparsixto randomized clinical trial showed that BRCA1
and BRCA2 carriers exposed to anthracycline, taxane, and bevaci-
zumab with or without carboplatin had high pathological com-
plete response (pCR) rates of 65%–67% compared with patients
without mutations (pCR rates of 35%–55%) (24). Whether TNBC
patients with other predisposition gene mutations will also bene-
fit from these and other targeted therapies remains to be deter-
mined, but future clinical trials involving TNBC patients should
consider multigene germline panel testing to provide insight into
a putative relationship between PVs and targeted TNBC treat-
ment responses.
There are several limitations of this study. As noted above, al-
though this study identifies TNBC-associated predisposition
genes, larger case–control studies and family-based segregation
studies will be needed to refine risks of TNBC and other breast
cancer subtypes associated with mutations in these genes. In ad-
dition, sequencing results from ExAC and gnomAD public control
subjects were used for the case–control association studies
reported here. Although these control subjects likely provide rea-
sonable approximations of population-based allele frequencies
(7), the lack of study level matching of the TNBC patients and con-
trol subjects and the derivation of sequencing data using different
sequencing platforms and allele-calling algorithms may have
resulted in some inaccuracies in gene-level PV frequencies and
associations with TNBC. However, extensive data cleaning and
filtering was used to normalize TNBC patient and control sub-
jects, and the ExAC control subjects have been used successfully
in multiple studies to evaluate cancer risk (25).
Overall, this study identifies several genes that predispose to
TNBC and are associated with high lifetime risks of TNBC and
overall breast cancer. The results suggest that all TNBC patients
should undergo multigene panel testing, regardless of age at di-
agnosis or family history of cancer, for improved cancer risk as-
sessment and because of the ongoing development of targeted
therapeutic approaches for TNBC patients with mutations in
predisposition genes.
