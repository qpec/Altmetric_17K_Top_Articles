APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer 
disease. ApoE4 increases brain amyloid-β pathology relative to other 
ApoE isoforms1. However, whether APOE independently influences 
tau pathology, the other major proteinopathy of Alzheimer disease 
and other tauopathies, or tau-mediated neurodegeneration, is not 
clear. By generating P301S tau transgenic mice on either a human 
ApoE knock-in (KI) or ApoE knockout (KO) background, here we 
show that P301S/E4 mice have significantly higher tau levels in the 
brain and a greater extent of somatodendritic tau redistribution 
by three months of age compared with P301S/E2, P301S/E3, and 
P301S/EKO mice. By nine months of age, P301S mice with different 
ApoE genotypes display distinct phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) 
staining patterns. P301S/E4 mice develop markedly more brain 
atrophy and neuroinflammation than P301S/E2 and P301S/E3 
mice, whereas P301S/EKO mice are largely protected from these 
changes. In vitro, E4-expressing microglia exhibit higher innate 
immune reactivity after lipopolysaccharide treatment. Co-culturing 
P301S tau-expressing neurons with E4-expressing mixed glia 
results in a significantly higher level of tumour-necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α) secretion and markedly reduced neuronal viability 
compared with neuron/E2 and neuron/E3 co-cultures. Neurons 
co-cultured with EKO glia showed the greatest viability with the 
lowest level of secreted TNF-α. Treatment of P301S neurons 
with recombinant ApoE (E2, E3, E4) also leads to some neuronal 
damage and death compared with the absence of ApoE, with ApoE4 
exacerbating the effect. In individuals with a sporadic primary 
tauopathy, the presence of an ε4 allele is associated with more 
severe regional neurodegeneration. In individuals who are positive 
for amyloid-β pathology with symptomatic Alzheimer disease 
who usually have tau pathology, ε4-carriers demonstrate greater 
rates of disease progression. Our results demonstrate that ApoE 
affects tau pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated 
neurodegeneration independently of amyloid-β pathology. ApoE4 
exerts a ‘toxic’ gain of function whereas the absence of ApoE is 
protective.
In 1993, APOE4 was identified as a strong genetic risk factor for 
late-onset Alzheimer disease2. Subsequently, a large amount of evidence

has demonstrated that a major mechanism by which ApoE influences 
Alzheimer disease is via ApoE influencing amyloid-β 
 deposition in 
both a dose and isoform-specific fashion (E4 > 
 E3 > 
 E2)1. However, 
there are probably other mechanisms by which ApoE influences not 
only Alzheimer disease but also other neurodegenerative diseases. 
 
A large body of evidence demonstrates that although amyloid-β 
 is 
 
probably a key initiator in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, its aggre-
gation and accumulation poorly correlate with disease symptoms or 
tissue loss3,4. In contrast, accumulation of tau in brains with Alzheimer 
 
disease and in primary tauopathies strongly correlates with clinical 
signs and neurodegeneration3–5. However, so far there is only circum-
stantial evidence that ApoE influences tauopathy independently of 
amyloid-β 
. ApoE has been shown to directly bind tau in vitro6, and 
neuronal expression of human ApoE in vivo results in tau hyper-
phosphorylation (E4 > E3)7. Recent genome-wide association studies 
show a strong and significant association of APOE with cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) tau and p-tau after correcting for the effect of APOE on 
 
amyloid-β 
42 levels8. In patients with frontotemporal dementia, a large 
percentage of whom have tauopathy, ε4 allele frequency was reported 
to be significantly elevated9,10, and ε4 carriers have greater atrophy in 
affected brain regions11 as well as exacerbated behavioural deficits12. 
These data suggest that ApoE may directly influence tau pathology and 
tau-mediated neurodegeneration.
To determine whether the presence of ApoE or human ApoE 
 
isoforms affect tau pathology and tau-related neuropathology, we used 
a P301S tauopathy mouse model, which overexpresses 1N4R human 
tau containing the P301S mutation that causes a form of frontotem-
poral dementia13. We generated P301S mice on either a human ApoE 
KI or ApoE KO background, designated as TE (Tau/ApoE) mice. We 
observed significantly more brain atrophy in 9-month-old P301S/E4 
(TE4) mice compared with P301S/E2 (TE2) and P301S/E3 (TE3) mice 
(Fig. 1a, b), but no change in 3-month-old TE mice or 9-month-old 
non-tau transgenic ApoE KI mice (Extended Data Fig. 1). The atrophy 
primarily occurred in the hippocampus, piriform/entorhinal cortex, 
and amygdala, and was accompanied by significant lateral ventricular 
enlargement (Fig. 1a, b). The granule cell layer in the  
dentate gyrus 
(Fig. 1c, d) and the pyramidal cell layer in the CA1 region (Extended 
Data Fig. 2) were noticeably and significantly thinner in TE4 mice, 
and the thickness correlated highly with hippocampal volume 
 
(Fig. 1e). Notably, the absence of ApoE in P301S mice (TEKO) largely 
attenuated neuronal loss and brain atrophy observed in P301S mice 
expressing human ApoE, and almost completely abolished ventricular 
dilatation (Fig. 1a–d). These results revealed an important role of ApoE 
in regulating tau-mediated neurodegeneration, with ApoE4 causing 
more severe damage and the absence of ApoE being protective.
Human tau levels in brain lysates were analysed by quantitative 
ELISA after sequential biochemical extraction in RAB (salt buffer), 
RIPA (detergent buffer), and 70% formic acid, which contain soluble 
tau, less soluble tau, and highly insoluble tau, respectively. At three 
months of age, before onset of overt tau pathology, TE4 mice had signif-
icantly higher tau levels in the RAB fraction than other ApoE genotypes 
 
(Fig. 2a). At nine months of age, when large amounts of tau pathology 
had developed, TE4 mice still had significantly higher tau levels, but the 
elevated tau had changed from being in the RAB to the RIPA fraction 
 
(Fig. 2a), indicating a greater amount of tau in a more insoluble  
fraction. 
The higher tau accumulation in TE4 mice was not due to  
differences 
in tau synthesis (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We found  
significant changes 
of autophagy-related gene expression in 9-month-old TE4 mice and 
9-month-old non-tau transgenic ApoE4 KI mice (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 3b, c), suggesting ApoE4 may affect autophagy-mediated tau 
 
clearance. This is consistent with a previous report of impaired 
autophagy associated with ApoE414. ApoE levels in the TE mice fol-
lowed the pattern E2 > E3 > E4 (Extended Data Fig. 3d, e),  
consistent 
with what has been reported in ApoE KI mice15. No major altera-
tion of ApoE levels was observed in the presence of tau pathology.

antibody, revealed a greater p-tau-covered area in 3-month-old TE4 
mouse hippocampus (Fig. 2b).
Although the pathological p-tau signal first appeared in the mossy 
fibres, axons of dentate gyrus granule cells in the hippocampus, TE4 
mice also showed more intense dentate gyrus cell body staining 
(Extended Data Fig. 4), indicating a greater redistribution of patho-
logical p-tau from axons to cell bodies at an early age. At nine months of 
age, the differences in overall p-tau immunoreactivity between TE mice 
decreased (Fig. 2b), with the emergence of four major p-tau  
staining 
patterns,  
designated as types 1–4 (Fig. 2d). These staining patterns 
strongly correlated with the level of brain atrophy, with type 1  
associated 
with the most  
preserved brain and type 4 associated with the greatest 
atrophy (Fig. 2c), suggesting potential differential toxicity  
associated 
with  
different p-tau immunoreactivity patterns. The distribution of 
p-tau immunoreactivity patterns differed across ApoE genotypes. 
 
Type 1 and type 2 were enriched in TEKO mice whereas type 4 was 
enriched in TE4 mice (Fig. 2e). The featured distribution of these p-tau 
immunoreactivity patterns, which either represent different tau struc-
tures or progressively more advanced pathological tau stages, indicate 
ApoE affects either tau conformation or tau pathology progression.
While pathological tau may directly cause neurodegeneration, it, 
along with degenerating neurons, may also induce chronic neuroinflam-
mation, which can lead to neuronal death via various mechanisms16,17. 
 
Previous studies have shown that ApoE4 is associated with higher innate 
immune reactivity than ApoE2 and ApoE3 (refs 18, 19). We confirmed 
this result in cultured microglia with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimula-
tion (Fig. 3a). This inherently higher inflammatory reactivity associated 
with ApoE4 may further exacerbate neurodegeneration. When we 
assessed microglial gene expression profiles in 9-month-old TE3, TE4, 
and TEKO mice as well as in 9-month-old non-tau transgenic ApoE 
KI and ApoE KO mice using a customized MG550 microglial gene 
chip (see Methods), we observed a marked upregulation of proinflam-
matory genes (cluster 1) and a concomitant downregulation of genes 
involved in normal cell function (cluster 2) in TE4 mice, whereas micro-
glia in TEKO mice largely remained in a homeostatic state (Fig. 3b–d 
and Supplementary Information for pathway analysis and gene list). 
Consistent with this, CD68-positive microglial  
staining, which repre-
sents an activated state of microglia, was significantly elevated in TE4 
mice, and was drastically reduced in TEKO mice (Fig. 3e, f). Notably, no 
proinflammatory gene activation and no or minimal gene expression 
differences were observed in 9-month-old ApoE KI and ApoE KO mice 
in the absence of P301S tau (Fig. 3b, d and Extended Data Fig. 5a, b) or 
in 3-month-old TE mice (Extended Data Fig. 5c, d), indicating the neces-
sity of tau pathology to initiate microglial activation and to enable the 
ApoE genotype- 
dependent effect on microglial activation. Intriguingly, 
p-tau immunoreactivity patterns were highly associated with the micro-
glial activation profile, with type 1 staining displaying the lowest, type 2 
and type 3 intermediate, and type 4 the strongest microglial activation 
(Extended Data Fig. 6),  
suggesting potentially distinct intrinsic capacities 
of different p-tau patterns to induce neuroinflammation.
Another key cell type in the brain, astrocytes, also play an  
essential 
role in neuroinflammation. Recent studies have identified two  
distinct 
types of reactive astrocyte in mice, depending on the initiating injury: ‘
A1’ 
induced by LPS-elicited inflammation, and ‘
A2’ induced by  
ischaemia20.

These reactive astrocytes are defined by three cassettes of genes: 
A1-specifc (inflammation only), A2-specific (ischaemia only), and PAN 
reactive (upregulated in both injuries)20. Recent data show that inflam-
mation-induced reactive microglia produce specific cytokines (TNF-α 
, 
 
IL1-α 
, C1q) that can activate ‘
A1’ astrocytes, which lose many normal 
astrocytic functions, and secrete toxic factors able to rapidly induce neu-
ronal death16.We observed strong activation of ‘
A1’ astrocytic genes in 
9-month-old TE4 mice, but not in 9-month-old TEKO mice or 3-month-
old TE4 mice (Fig. 4a), nor in 9-month-old wild type (WT) and non-tau 
transgenic ApoE KI mice (Extended Data Fig. 7). In  
addition, glial fibril-
lary acidic protein (GFAP) signal was drastically elevated in 9-month-old 
TE4 mice, but not in TEKO mice (Fig. 4b, c, e). The amount of GFAP 
immunoreactivity highly correlated with brain volume (Fig. 4d), strongly 
suggesting a detrimental role of reactive astrocytes in neurodegeneration.
Remarkably, the detrimental effect of ApoE4 on neurodegeneration 
and the protective effect associated with the absence of ApoE were 
robustly recapitulated in vitro. When co-culturing P301S tau- 
expressing 
neurons with mixed glial cells derived from ApoE KI or ApoE KO mice, 
drastic neuronal death occurred in the neuron/E4 glia co- 
culture, 
whereas neurons co-cultured with EKO glia showed the least injury 
 
(Fig. 4f, g). In addition, a significantly higher level of TNF-α 
 was 
detected in the neuron/E4 co-culture medium whereas minimal TNF-α 
 
levels were detected in the neuron/EKO co-culture medium (Fig. 4h), 
 
indicating activated glia probably play an important role in inducing 
neuronal death. Treatment of P301S tau-expressing  
neurons with 
recombinant ApoE, regardless of ApoE isoform,  
invariably led to 
reduced neurite arborization and increased neuronal death  
compared 
with non-ApoE-treated neurons, and these effects were most  
prominent 
with ApoE4 treatment (Fig. 4i, j), indicating that ApoE itself was directly 
involved in inducing neurotoxicity in P301S tau-expressing  
susceptible 
neurons. ApoE has been shown to accumulate in damaged neurons of 
Pick disease21 and in neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-bearing neurons of 
Alzheimer disease22, suggesting a potential role of ApoE in  
mediating 
neurotoxicity under pathological conditions. However, overall  
neuronal 
loss or damage after ApoE treatment was much milder than that 
observed in neuron–glia co-cultures, suggesting an additive role of 
concomitant neuroinflammation in exacerbating neurodegeneration.
To investigate whether the pro-neurodegenerative effect of ApoE4 
also manifests in human primary tauopathies, we assessed post- 
mortem 
regional neurodegeneration severity in relation to ApoE genotype in

individuals with a primary diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration, Pick 
disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, the three most prevalent 
sporadic primary tauopathies. Possession of an ε4 allele was associ-
ated with more severe regional neurodegeneration (linear mixed-effects 
model, estimate 0.31, P = 
 0.035, 95% (CI 0.02, 0.59)) after controlling 
for age, sex, diagnosis, rater, amyloid-β 
 deposition, Lewy body  
disease, 
tau burden, and TDP-43 inclusion burden (Extended Data Table 1). In 
addition, we demonstrated greater regional neurodegeneration as a 
function of tau burden (estimate 0.17, P < 
 0.001. 95% CI (0.14, 0.20)) 
and TDP-43 proteinopathy (estimate 0.22, P = 
 0.003, 95% CI (0.07, 
0.37)). By contrast, amyloid-β 
 deposition was associated with less 
severe neurodegeneration (estimate 0.08, P = 
 0.044, 95% CI (− 
0.15, 
 
− 
0.002)), and Lewy body disease, which was relatively uncommon in 
this cohort, showed no effect (estimate − 
0.01, P = 0.87, 95% CI (− 
0.17, 
0.15)) (Extended Data Table 1). We also analysed disease progression 
in relation to APOE allele status in a cohort of individuals with low CSF 
amyloid-β42 who had symptomatic Alzheimer disease, who invariably 
possess amyloid-β 
 deposition and usually have tau pathology. We found 
possession of the ε4 allele was associated with significantly higher rates 
of clinical disease progression (P = 
 0.02) in a dose-dependent manner. 
Individuals with one ε4 allele progressed 14% faster than non-carriers, 
and those with two ε4 alleles progressed 23% faster (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 8). Overall, these findings provide converging evidence in humans 
that possession of the ε4 allele worsens neurodegeneration in the setting 
of a tauopathy, with or without amyloid-β pathology.
Taken together, we found ApoE affects neurodegeneration in the 
context of tau pathology independently of amyloid-β 
. ApoE4 resulted 
in aggravated neurodegeneration whereas the absence of ApoE was 
strongly neuroprotective. This was probably a direct effect of ApoE 
modulating tau pathology from an early age, which ultimately led to 
various tau forms/patterns potentially possessing distinct  
neurotoxicity. 
On the other hand, we found ApoE itself, especially ApoE4, was  
essential 
to P301S neuronal death. With pathological tau accumulation, the pres-
ence of ApoE, especially ApoE4, may make neurons more susceptible to 
degeneration, whereas the absence of ApoE may protect neurons from 
death. The presence of degenerating neurons appeared to further induce 
neuroinflammation, which was augmented by ApoE4 owing to its inher-
ently higher innate immune reactivity. While  
activated microglia may 
be protective to some extent in the setting of amyloid-β 
  
pathology, by 
targeting plaques and reducing dystrophic neurites23,24, they could be 
deleterious in tauopathy by directly  
targeting injured  
neurons and by 
activating toxic A1 astrocytes. Enhanced  
neuroinflammation associ-
ated with ApoE4 may further exacerbate neurodegeneration (Extended 
Data Fig. 9 for hypothesis summary). These new findings suggest a 
 
re- 
evaluation of the role of ApoE in Alzheimer disease and other tauopa-
thies. Targeting ApoE, especially ApoE4, may be a promising therapeutic 
approach in reducing tau- 
mediated neurodegeneration.

Animals. Human ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 KI mice (C57BL/6) were provided 
by P. M. Sullivan (Duke University) and ApoE KO mice (C57BL/6) were purchased 
from The Jackson Laboratory (002052). P301S tau transgenic mice (The Jackson 
Laboratory, 008169) on a B6/C3 background expressing human P301S 1N4R tau 
driven by PrP promoter were crossed to human ApoE KI mice to generate P301ShE/hE 
 
mice for all three ApoE isoforms, which were then crossed to ApoE KO mice 
to generate P301ShE/− mice. Separately, ApoE KI mice were crossed to ApoE 
KO mice to generate hE/− 
 mice. P301ShE/− mice were then crossed with 
 
hE/− 
 mice to  
generate P301ShE/hE, P301ShE/−, and P301S−/− littermates for all 
three ApoE isoforms. All tau transgenic mice for final analysis were kept at the 
same  
generation and had ~ 
90% C57BL/6 background by congenic test. Only male 
ApoE  
homozygote and KO mice were used for analysis. P301S ApoE KO mice 
derived from three ApoE isoforms showed no difference in analysis and were com-
bined as one single group (TEKO). WT mice were purchased from Charles River 
Laboratories (027) on a C57BL/6 background and were bred separately from the 
P301S/ApoE mice. Owing to a slightly different background of the WT mice, we 
did not perform statistical analysis comparing WT with other mice. All animal 
procedures and experiments were performed under guidelines approved by the 
animal studies committee at Washington University School of Medicine. Sample 
sizes were chosen on the basis of estimates to provide 80% power to see significant 
differences of 20% or greater. All assessment and analysis of data obtained from 
mice was performed by someone blind to the genotypes of the animals.
Immunohistochemistry. The left hemi-brain of each mouse was sectioned coro-
nally at 50 μ 
m using a freezing sliding microtome. Three sections from each mouse 
(300 μ 
m apart), corresponding approximately to bregma coordinates − 
1.4, − 
1.7, 
and − 
2.0 mm respectively, were used for p-tau staining described in ref. 25. 
Briefly, brain sections were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer three times 
 
followed by incubation in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in TBS for 10 min at room 
temperature. After three washes in TBS, sections were blocked with 3% milk in 
0.25% TBS-X (Triton X-100) for 0.5 h followed by incubation at 4 °C overnight 
with biotinylated AT8 antibody (Thermo Scientific, MN1020B, 1:500). The next 
day, the slices were developed using a VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit (Vector 
 
laboratories) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Stained sections were 
imaged by a NanoZoomer digital pathology system and pathology was quanti-
fied using Image J. For immunofluorescence, two sections (bregma − 
1.7 mm and 
 
− 
2.0 mm for CD68, bregma − 
2.3 mm and − 
2.6 mm for GFAP) from each mouse 
were used. The sections were washed in TBS three times, and blocked with 3% BSA 
in 0.25% TBS-X for 0.5 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation 
at 4 °C with primary antibodies (CD68: AbD SeroTec, MCA1957, 1:500; GFAP: 
EMD Millipore, MAB3402, 1:2,000). The next day, the sections were washed in TBS 
and incubated with fluorescence-labelled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, 
1:500) for 2 h at room temperature. The slices were then washed and mounted in 
ProLong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, P36931). Images 
were taken with an epi-fluorescence microscope at 4× 
 magnification and quan-
tified using MetaMorph.
Volumetric analysis. Every sixth coronal brain section (300 μ 
m between  
sections) 
starting rostrally at bregma + 
2.1 mm to the dorsal end of the hippocampus at 
bregma − 
3.9 mm were mounted for each mouse. All mounted sections were 
stained with 0.1% Sudan black in 70% ethanol at room temperature for 20 min, then 
washed in 70% ethanol for 1 min, three times. The sections were finally washed in 
Milli-Q water three times and coverslipped with Fluoromount. The stained slices 
were imaged with the NanoZoomer and areas of interest were traced and measured 
in each slice using the NDP viewer. The volume was calculated using the  
following 
formula: volume = 
 (sum of area) × 
 0.3 mm. For hippocampus and  
posterior  
lateral 
ventricle, quantification started from bregma − 
1.1 mm and ended at bregma 
 
− 
3.9 mm. For piriform/entorhinal cortex, quantification started at bregma 
 
− 
2.3 mm and ended at bregma − 
3.9 mm. All staining and analysis of data obtained 
were performed by someone blind to the genotypes of the animals being assessed.
Neuronal layer thickness measurement. Three sections (bregma − 
1.4, − 
1.7, and 
− 
2.0 mm) from each mouse were mounted and stained in cresyl violet for 5 min 
at room temperature. The slices were then sequentially dehydrated in 50%, 70%, 
95% (three times) and 100% ethanol (twice) for 1 min, then cleared in xylene for 
4 min (twice), and coverslipped in cytoseal60 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 8310-16). 
 
The thicknesses of the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and dentate gyrus granular cell 
layer were measured by drawing a scale perpendicular to the cell layer at two spots 
in all three slices and taking the average value for each mouse. All staining and 
analysis of data obtained were performed by someone blind to the genotypes of 
the animals being assessed.
Brain extraction. Mouse cortex was processed in RAB, RIPA, and 70% formic acid 
buffer sequentially as described previously25 with modifications. Briefly, the tissue 
was weighed and homogenized using a pestle with 10 μ 
l buffer per 1 mg tissue in 
RAB buffer (100 mM MES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 750 mM NaCl, 20 mM 
NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, pH = 
 7.0, supplemented by protease inhibitors (Complete, 
Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Roche)). After centrifugation at 
50,000g for 20 min, the supernatant was taken as the RAB-soluble fraction and the 
pellet was dissolved in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 0.5%  
deoxycholic 
acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 
 
pH 8.0, supplemented by Complete and PhosSTOP) at 10 μ 
l buffer per 1 mg tissue 
by sonication. After centrifugation at 50,000g for 20 min, the supernatant was taken 
as the RIPA-soluble fraction. The pellet was sonicated in 70% formic acid at 10 μ 
l 
buffer per 1 mg tissue, and centrifuged at 50,000g for 20 min. The supernatant 
was taken as the formic-acid-soluble fraction. All fractions were stored in − 
80 °C 
until analysed.
ELISA. Human tau and ApoE ELISAs were performed as described previously25. 
For coating antibodies, Tau5 (gift from L. Binder, Northwestern University, 
Chicago, Illinois, USA) was used for human tau ELISA, and HJ15.6 (in-house-
made anti-human ApoE antibody) was used for human ApoE ELISA. For detection 
antibodies, biotinylated HT7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MN1000B) was used for 
tau ELISA and biotinylated HJ15.4 (in house-made anti-human ApoE antibody) 
was used for human ApoE ELISA. All measurements and analysis of data obtained 
were performed by someone blind to the genotypes of the animals being assessed.
Western blot. Mouse cortex was homogenized by sonication in RIPA buffer 
supplemented with Complete and PhosSTOP. Samples were separated by 4–12% 
NuPAGE (Invitrogen) gel using MOPS buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose 
membranes. Primary antibodies anti-GFAP (Millipore, MAB 3402), anti-GAPDH 
(Abcam, ab9484), anti-ApoE (Abcam, ab24139), anti-α 
 tubulin (Sigma, T5168), 
and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used for detection. 
Membranes were developed using Lumigen TMA6 (GE Healthcare).
qRT–PCR for human tau. RNAs were isolated from mouse cortex using RNeasy 
Mini Kit (QIAGEN,74104), and reverse transcribed to complementary DNA using 
a high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems, 4387406). Quantitative 
PCR was performed using Taqman primers and probes with Taqman Universal 
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, 4304437). Quantitative PCR and analysis 
of data obtained were performed by someone blind to the genotypes of the animals 
being assessed.
Nanostring gene expression assay. RNAs were isolated from mouse hippocampus 
using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 74104). We performed nCounter multiplexed 
target profiling of 534 microglial transcripts with a custom-designed microglial 
gene chip (MG550) using the Nanostring nCounter technology (http://nanostring.
com), which allows analysis of up to 800 genes from a single sample. Selection of 
genes was based on genes and proteins specifically or highly expressed in adult 
homeostatic microglia26 plus 150 inflammation-related genes that were signifi-
cantly affected in EAE, APP-PS1 and SOD1 mice27. Using this signature, we 
 
generated a new version (v3) of Nanostring-based microglia chip termed 
MG550. For each sample, 100 ng RNA was used for hybridization, and all data 
were  
normalized to six housekeeping genes: Cltc, Gapdh, Gusb, Hprt1, Pgk1, and 
Tubb5. All gene expression assays and analysis of data obtained were performed 
by  
someone blind to the genotypes of the animals being assessed.
Microfluidic qRT–PCR for astrocytic genes. Total RNA was extracted from 
mouse cortex using an RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen) and microfluidic qRT–PCR was 
performed as described16.
Primary neuron culture and recombinant ApoE treatment. Primary neurons 
were obtained from E17 WT mouse (Charles River, 022) fetuses. Hippocampi 
were dissected in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks’ Balanced Salt solution 
(HBSS) with careful strip of meninges. Tissue was digested in HBSS containing 
0.25% trypsin (GIBCO 15090-046) and 0.2 mg ml−1 DNase (Sigma DN-25) at 
37 °C for 10 min, and was dissociated in HBSS containing 0.4 mg ml−1 DNase 
using a fire-polished Pasteur glass pipette and filtered through a 70-μ 
m nylon 
mesh. Filtered material was pelleted at 1,000g for 5 min, washed with neurobasal 
medium (neurobasal + 1× B27 + 1× penicillin/streptomycin + 1× l-glutamine) 
once, and infected with AAV2/8-synapsin-P301S tau virus for 3 h on ice. Cells 
were then pelleted, washed, and plated onto 24-well tissue culture plates over glass 
cover slips that had been coated with 10 μ 
g ml−1 poly-l-lysine (PLL, Sigma, P2636) 
at a density of 20,000 cells per well in neurobasal medium. For all cell culture 
 
experiments, only the central wells of the plates were used with the peripheral wells 
filled with 1 ml autoclaved double-distilled H2O to avoid different rates of medium 
evaporation during the culture. Recombinant ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 (Leinco, 
A215, A218, A219) were added to the medium (10 μ 
g ml−1) at the time of plating. 
Neurons were kept for 3 weeks with addition of 200 μ 
l fresh recombinant ApoE-
containing medium (10 μ 
g ml−1) each well every week, and were then stained with 
MAP2 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, OSM00030W) for analysis and with 
HT7B (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MN1000B) antibody to confirm tau expression.
Glia-neuron co-culture. E2, E3, E4, and EKO glia were obtained from P2 pups 
from the respective human ApoE KI or ApoE KO mice. Cortex was dissected and 
dissociated in the same way as with neuron isolation. Cells were plated in glial

medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1× Pen/strep + 1× Glutamax). Once monolayers 
were confluent, cells were replated in 24-well plates over glass cover slips coated 
with geltrex (Gibco, A1413201) at a density of 75,000 cells per well, and allowed to 
grow for 2 days in glia medium. The glia were then washed with 1 ml neurobasal 
medium (Neurobasal + 
 2% B27 + 
 1× penicillin/streptomycin + 
 1× l-glutamine) 
and placed in 400 μ 
l neurobasal medium before use. Primary neurons expressing 
P301S tau were prepared as described above, and were directly plated on top of 
the glia at a density of 20,000 cells per well. The co-cultures were kept for 3 weeks 
with addition of 200 μ 
l fresh neurobasal medium each well every week. Neurons 
were then stained with MAP2 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, OSM00030W) 
for analysis and with HT7B (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MN1000B) antibody to 
confirm tau expression.
Primary microglia culture, LPS stimulation and cytokine measurement. Mixed 
glia culture from ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 KI mice were prepared as described 
above in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5 ng ml−1 
 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Loosely attached microglia 
were harvested at DIV12 by shaking for 2 h at 400 r.p.m. and then seeded onto 
12-well tissue culture plates coated with PLL at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well. 
The next day, seeded microglia were washed in serum-free medium (SFM-DMEM/
F12 + 
 0.2% BSA + 
1× 
 penicillin/streptomycin) and placed in 450 μ 
l serum-free 
medium. Cells were then treated with 1 ng ml−1 LPS (Sigma, L5293) for 24 h. Media 
were collected and spun down at 10,000g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected 
and assayed for mouse TNF-α 
, IL-1α 
, and IL-1β 
 using single cytokine ELISAs (Bon 
Opus Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All cytokine levels 
were normalized to microglial protein levels determined by BCA assay.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells were fixed in DPBS containing 4% PFA and 4% 
sucrose at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.3% PBST for 
10 min. After blocking in 0.1% PBS–Triton X-100 containing 3% BSA and 3% goat 
serum for 30 min at room temperature, cells were incubated in primary antibodies 
overnight at 4 °C. The next day, cells were washed with 0.1% PBST three times and 
incubated in secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then 
washed three times in 0.1% PBST and mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade mounting 
 
medium (Molecular probes, P36931). Images were taken with an epi-fluorescence 
microscope at 10× 
 magnification and quantified using MetaMorph. Staining and 
analysis of immunocytochemistry data obtained were performed by someone blind 
to the genotypes of the animals being assessed.
Study of neurodegeneration in human primary tauopathies. We searched the 
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Neurodegenerative Disease Brain 
Bank database for patients with APOE genotyping and a pathological diagnosis 
of corticobasal degeneration, Pick disease, or progressive supranuclear palsy, the 
three most common sporadic forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau. 
Authorization for autopsy was provided by patients’ next-of-kin, and procedures 
were approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research. We constrained our 
search to patients autopsied since 2007, when systematic, prospective recording 
of neuropathological findings began. Such data were available from 29 patients 
with corticobasal degeneration, 17 with Pick disease, and 33 with progressive 
supranuclear palsy. Demographics and relevant variables are shown in Extended 
Data Table 1a.
Post-mortem brains were processed as previously described28. Fixed tissue 
slabs were dissected into blocks representing dementia-relevant brain regions, 
 
embedded in paraffin wax, and cut into 8 μ 
m-thick sections. Regional neurode-
generation was assessed using haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Neuronal 
loss, astrogliosis, and microvacuolation were semi-quantitatively graded as absent (0), 
 
mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). A similar scheme was used to rate amyloid-β 
deposits (neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and vascular amyloid-beta deposits)29, 
tau inclusions (neurofibrillary tangles, Pick bodies, globose tangles, neuronal 
 
cytoplasmic inclusions (other than those listed previously), tufted astrocytes, 
thorny astrocytes, astrocytic plaques, neuropil threads, and other glial cytoplasmic 
inclusions), α 
-synuclein inclusions (Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites), and TDP-43 
inclusions (neuronal intranuclear inclusions, neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, 
dystrophic neurites, glial cytoplasmic inclusions). Semi-quantitative grading was 
performed by someone blind to APOE genotype. Composite scores of neurode-
generation (ND score) [(microvacuolation + 
 astrogliosis)/2) + 
 neuronal loss] and 
for tau, amyloid-β 
, α 
-synuclein, and TDP-43 were generated for each region by 
summing scores across inclusion types for each pathological protein.
We limited analyses to regions that had been stained for all four patholog-
ical proteins. This approach yielded a total of 609 regional assessments across 
the 79 patients, with an average of 8 regions per patient. Hippocampal CA1–4, 
 
subiculum, dentate gyrus, and entorhinal cortex were the most commonly assessed 
regions and available in 72 out of 79 patients. Additional regions available from 
no fewer than 15 patients included midbrain subregions (oculomotor nucleus, 
tectum, periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe, and substantia nigra), anterior cingulate 
 
cortex, and middle frontal gyrus (Extended Data Table 1b). A linear mixed-effects 
model conducted at the brain regional level was used to determine the influence 
of multiple predictors on composite neurodegeneration scores. APOE ε4 carrier 
status was used as the binary predictor of interest; additional fixed-effects in the 
model included tau, amyloid-β 
, TDP-43, and α 
-synuclein composite scores; sex; 
age; pathological diagnosis; rater; and brain region. Patient identity was modelled 
as a random effect. The primary hypothesis was that possession of an ApoE  
ε4 allele 
would be associated with greater regional neurodegeneration after controlling for 
tau pathological burden and other relevant predictors.
Analysis of clinical disease progression in human Alzheimer disease patients. 
Participants in this study were part of two different longitudinal studies, the 
Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington University 
and the ADNI. Details of the Knight ADRC and ADNI studies are listed in the 
Supplementary Information. All procedures were approved by the Washington 
University Human Research Protection Office, and written informed consent was 
obtained from each participant.
Statistical analysis. The experiments were not randomized. Unless explicitly 
stated, all mouse and cell culture data are shown as mean ± 
 s.e.m. Differences 
between groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s 
 
multiple comparisons tests. For all experiments, data normality was analysed 
using a D’Agostino–Pearson omnibus normality test. For data not following 
 
normal distribution, a Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison test 
was performed for statistical analysis, and is stated in the figure legends. GraphPad 
Prism version 6.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software) was used for these analyses 
and to create the plots. For statistical analysis of the p-tau staining pattern distribu-
tion, two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were performed using the ‘fisher.test’ function 
in R version 3.4.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for all four TE 
groups together, as well as for individual comparisons between each two groups.
Data availability. Source data of graphs plotted in Figs 1–4 and Extended Data 
 
Figs 1–6 are available as source data files. Other data are available from the corres-
ponding author upon reasonable request. Nanostring gene list, gene pathway analysis,

Extended Data Figure 9 | Schematic summary of hypotheses.  
a, ApoE is essential for neuronal death under pathological conditions. 
With pathological tau accumulation, the presence of ApoE, especially 
ApoE4, renders the neurons more susceptible to degeneration, 
whereas the absence of ApoE protects neurons from death, resulting 
in neurodegeneration (E4 > E3 ≈ E2 > 
> EKO). Degenerating neurons 
further induce neuroinflammation, which is augmented by ApoE4 owing 
to its inherent higher innate immune reactivity, thereby exacerbating 
neurodegeneration further. Neuroinflammation may concomitantly 
affect tau pathology13, resulting in various p-tau staining types that could 
also contribute to neurodegeneration. b, ApoE affects tau pathogenesis, 
resulting in different p-tau patterns, which may possess distinct 
neurotoxicity (type4 > type3 ≈ type2 > type1), leading to different 
levels of neuronal death and brain atrophy (E4 > E3 ≈ E2 > 
> EKO). 
Neuroinflammation accompanying neurodegeneration will in turn 
exacerbate neuronal death. c, ApoE affects tau pathogenesis, resulting 
in different p-tau patterns that may have different capacities to induce 
neuroinflammation (type4 > type3 ≈ type2 > type1), which eventually 
leads to various degrees of neurodegeneration.

a, Demographics and relevant variables of patients. Brain regional neurodegeneration was analysed using post-mortem neuropathological data from a collection of 79 patients with primary tauopathy 
with sporadic frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-tau: 29 with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), 17 with Pick disease, and 33 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Among these patients, 
19 were ε4 carriers. Possession of an ε4 allele was associated with more severe regional neurodegeneration (linear mixed-effects model, estimate 0.31, P 
= 
0.035, 95% CI (0.02, 0.59)) after controlling 
for age, sex, diagnosis, rater, amyloid-β deposition, Lewy body disease, tau burden, and TDP-43 inclusion burden. Greater regional neurodegeneration was found as a function of tau burden (estimate

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
We utilized N~15 mice per group for most of the analysis, as this size gives us 80% 
power to see differences between groups of  >20% with two-sided significance of 
0.05 in this P301S mouse model. We added more mice per group later to achieve a 
sample size of ~20-30 when we performed the statistical analysis for the p-tau 
staining pattern distribution, as this analysis requires larger sample size to achieve 
meaningful statistics. We also used this increased sample size for brain volume 
analysis in the revised manuscript.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
For analysis of clinical disease progression in human AD patients, sample selection 
was done as follow: only participants that had an AD diagnosis at the last visit and 
had a CSF profile compatible with AD were included in our analyses. Non-AD 
dementia was excluded, as well as individuals in which the CDR at last assessment 
was equal to 0. Individuals with diagnoses of neurological diseases other than AD 
were excluded. Not informative longitudinally measured CDR-SB was removed for 
each participant. After removing the non-informative data points only individuals 
with at least 1.5 year of follow-up were included. A total of 592 participants were 
included in the analyses.
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
All attempts at replication were successful
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
For biochemical assay and histological staining, the "RAND" function in EXCEL was 
applied to assign each sample a random number and sorted smallest to largest to 
generate random order. For gene expression assay, equal number of samples from 
each group were placed on each chip by complete randomization to avoid cross-
chip variability
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
Quantification of brain volume, AT8 staining, p-tau patterns, and fluorescent 
staining were performed by individuals blinded to samples IDs. Microglial/
astrocytic gene expression assays were performed by collaborators who were 
blinded to sample IDs. Cell culture images were taken and data quantified by 
individuals blinded to sample IDs.
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.

7. Software
Describe the software used to analyze the data in this 
study. 
GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was 
used for all mouse and cell culture data analysis except for the p-tau staining 
pattern analysis, R version 3.4.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing) was 
used for statistical analysis. For human AD data, R version 3.3.3 "Another Canoe" 
platform x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu(64-bit) and the package nlme were used for 
linear mixed model. For human primary tauopathy data,
For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the paper but not yet described in the published literature, software must be made 
available to editors and reviewers upon request. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). Nature Methods guidance for 
providing algorithms and software for publication provides further information on this topic.

11. Description of research animals
Provide details on animals and/or animal-derived 
materials used in the study.
Human ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 knockin (KI) mice (C57BL/6) were provided by 
Dr. Patrick M. Sullivan (Duke University) and ApoE knockout (KO) mice (C57BL/6) 
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (#002052). P301S tau transgenic 
mice (The Jackson Laboratory, #008169) on a B6/C3 background expressing human 
P301S 1N4R tau driven by PrP promoter were crossed to human ApoE KI mice to 
generate P301S hE/hE mice for all three ApoE isoforms, which were then crossed 
to ApoE KO mice to generate P301S hE/- mice. Separately, ApoE KI mice were 
crossed to ApoE KO mice to generate hE/- mice. P301S hE/- mice were then 
crossed with hE/- mice to generate P301S hE/hE, P301S hE/- and P301S -/- 
littermates for all three ApoE isoforms. All tau transgenic mice for final analysis 
were kept at the same generation and had ~90% C57BL/6 background by congenic 
test. Only male ApoE homozygote and knockout mice were used for analysis. WT 
mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (#027) on a C57BL/6 
background and were bred separately from the P301S/ApoE mice.  
 
For cell culture experiments, primary astrocytes and microglia are derived from 
ApoE2KI, ApoE3KI, ApoE4KI, and APOEKO mice described above. Primary neurons 
are derived from CD-1® IGS WT Mouse from Charles River (#022).
