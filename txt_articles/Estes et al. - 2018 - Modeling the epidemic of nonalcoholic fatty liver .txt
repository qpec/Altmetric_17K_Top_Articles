Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are highly prevalent in the
United States, where they are a growing cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and increasingly an indicator
for liver transplantation. A Markov model was used to forecast NAFLD disease progression. Incidence of NAFLD was based
on historical and projected changes in adult prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Assumptions were
derived from published literature where available and validated using national surveillance data for incidence of NAFLD-
related HCC. Projected changes in NAFLD-related cirrhosis, advanced liver disease, and liver-related mortality were quanti-
fied through 2030. Prevalent NAFLD cases are forecasted to increase 21%, from 83.1 million (2015) to 100.9 million (2030),
while prevalent NASH cases will increase 63% from 16.52 million to 27.00 million cases. Overall NAFLD prevalence among
the adult population (aged �15 years) is projected at 33.5% in 2030, and the median age of the NAFLD population will
increase from 50 to 55 years during 2015-2030. In 2015, approximately 20% of NAFLD cases were classified as NASH,
increasing to 27% by 2030, a reflection of both disease progression and an aging population. Incidence of decompensated cir-
rhosis will increase 168% to 105,430 cases by 2030, while incidence of HCC will increase by 137% to 12,240 cases. Liver
deaths will increase 178% to an estimated 78,300 deaths in 2030. During 2015-2030, there are projected to be nearly 800,000
excess liver deaths. Conclusion: With continued high rates of adult obesity and DM along with an aging population, NAFLD-
related liver disease and mortality will increase in the United States. Strategies to slow the growth of NAFLD cases and thera-
peutic options are necessary to mitigate disease burden. (HEPATOLOGY 2018;67:123-133).

 metabolic syndrome.(5) While other conditions, such
as genetic disorders of lipid metabolism, can also cause
hepatic fat deposition, they are far less common than
excess body weight and features of metabolic syndrome
as risk factors for NAFLD.(4)
NAFLD can manifest as nonalcoholic fatty liver
(NAFL) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
NASH has a substantially higher risk of progression to
cirrhosis compared to NAFL. The fibrosis stage is
important for monitoring the clinical risk of progres-
sion to cirrhosis and long-term liver-related outcomes
and mortality.(6) Most liver-related outcomes occur
once cirrhosis has developed, with the exception of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that can occur even
in the absence of cirrhosis.(7) Thus, the need for health
care resources increases substantially with progression
to cirrhosis. NASH is rapidly rising as an etiology of
end-stage liver disease and is currently the second most
common etiology of HCC requiring liver transplanta-
tion.(8,9) Increasing age, obesity, and type 2 diabetes
mellitus (DM) have been consistently identified as risk
factors for fibrotic progression to cirrhosis.(5)
There is currently no national public health policy
addressing NAFLD. There is thus an unmet need to
develop models to define the current and future impact
of the disease to drive decision making with respect to
research resource allocation, national screening, sur-
veillance strategies, and outcomes assessment. Recent
studies have provided an exhaustive assessment of the
number of subjects with disease based on published
studies of NAFLD and NASH as well as a model of
disease and economic burden.(10-12) However, this
steady-state model relied on existing literature on the
epidemiology of NAFLD, which is confounded by
varying case definitions, methods for assessment, small
and heterogeneous populations, and variable analytic
approaches. Finally, there is still no dynamic model
that defines the health and health care burden of
NAFLD over the decades to come.
The objective of this study was to develop a dynamic
model of NAFLD to assess the health burden of the
disease at a population level that allows a forecast of
the health care impact of NAFLD. It is designed to be
a “living document” by creating a conceptual frame-
work that can be periodically updated based on emerg-
ing data. It is hoped that such a model will provide
stakeholders a rationale for allocation of resources for
the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.
Materials and Methods
MARKOV MODEL
The details of the Markov model are described in
Supporting Sections S1-S4, and an overview is pre-
sented here. The model began with the annual esti-
mated number of incident NAFLD cases, which was
back calculated using the change in incidence of obe-
sity and DM in the United States and the estimated
prevalence of NAFLD in 2015 (see Supporting
Section S4 for details).
Disease progression through 2030 was estimated
through METAVIR fibrosis stage and advanced liver
disease (Fig. 1), with annual adjustment for all-cause
mortality (background mortality, excess cardiovascular
deaths, and liver-related deaths). Disease progression
was simulated by multiplying the total number of cases
at a particular stage of the disease by a progression rate
to the next stage. Age-specific fibrosis progression rates
were back calculated based on assumptions for the dis-
tribution of cases by NASH status and fibrosis stage
(Supporting Section S2). A critical step in developing
the model was comparison of results to national regis-
try data for liver cancer incidence and mortality.(13)
Progression rates were modified to ensure that model
outputs aligned with reported data for the number of
NAFLD-related HCC cases, HCC deaths, and de-
compensated cirrhosis cases. Factors influencing rates

 of progression and regression in the NAFLD popula-
tion are heterogeneous. For the purpose of the model,
progression rates were assumed to be the sum of for-
ward progression minus the rate of regression, which is
common among NAFLD cases based on studies of
consecutive liver biopsies.(14)
INPUTS
A literature search was used to identify research
reporting the prevalence and incidence of NAFLD and
NASH, including its stages. Indexed articles available
on PubMed and nonindexed sources, such as national
data reports, were used. In addition, the Delphi process
(Supporting Section S5) was used in which experts were
interviewed to identify and obtain consensus around
crucial modeling inputs and to validate outputs for cur-
rent and future disease burden against available empiri-
cal data. When input data were unavailable, expert
input was used. Ranges were used to capture uncertainty
in inputs with relatively larger ranges to imply greater
uncertainty. NAFLD/NASH epidemiology data were
reported in different years, and modeling was used to
calibrate model outputs to time of data collection.
PREVALENCE
There are varied estimates of NAFLD prevalence in
the general population. An estimated 17%-51% of
adults have NAFLD.(4,15-17) Analysis of liver ultra-
sound data collected between 1988 and 1994 from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) reported that 19% of adults
have NAFLD,(18) while a meta-analysis of studies
from 2006-2014 estimated a NAFLD prevalence of
24% (20%-29%) in the general population.(10)
For this model, it was assumed that 30.0% of individ-
uals aged �15 years of age in 2015 experienced
NAFLD, with a large majority experiencing steatosis
only. With this input, NAFLD prevalence in the total
population was estimated at 25.8% after accounting for
lower rates among persons aged <15 years, equivalent to
approximately 83.1 million Americans with NAFLD.
AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION
The age and sex distribution of the NAFLD popula-
tion was based on data from NHANES III, a national
cross sectional survey including over 12,000 adults. This
study defined NAFLD as steatosis as measured on ultra-
sound without evidence of elevated alcohol consump-
tion.(18)
While
prevalence
rates
are
reported
for
individuals aged <30 years, it was assumed that preva-
lence would decline among the youngest age groups.
The reported ratio of male to female prevalence varied
by age group, with the lowest male/female ratio among
individuals <30 years (0.94) and the highest among
individuals aged 40-49 years (1.31). The prevalence rates
by age were adjusted proportionally to sum to 83.1 mil-
lion NAFLD cases in 2015 (Fig. 2).
NASH-STAGE STATUS
The prevalence of NASH was calculated based on
published estimates and modeling of fibrosis progres-
sion. It was assumed that up to 5% of NAFLD cases
without NASH could be NASH regressors, with most
NASH regressors still in F0 stage. Therefore, a rela-
tively small number of cases in stages F1-F4 were
assumed to be non-NASH fatty liver. However, the
vast majority of modeled fibrotic cases (F1-F4) were
assumed to be NASH.
Reported estimates show that 3%-5% of adults in the
United
States
have
NASH.(4,16,19,20)
This
model
assumes that approximately 20% of NAFLD cases
would be classified as NASH in 2015, corresponding to
3% of the adult population. Estimates of NASH preva-
lence and fibrosis progression rates among NAFLD
cases are subject to some uncertainty due to the variable
populations studied and the largely retrospective meth-
odology used to assess progression.(21) For this analysis,
it was estimated that 20%-25% of those with NAFLD
currently have NASH and that about 20% of those with
NASH have �F3 fibrosis.(21-25) A detailed list of stud-
ies reviewed for these estimates is provided in the

 supplemental documents available online (Supporting
Section S6). It was also assumed that it would take 20-
30 years for progression to cirrhosis and the rates of
decompensation in those with cirrhosis would be about
3%-4% annually.(26,27)
MORTALITY
Nonliver-related background mortality rates by age
and sex were calculated based on historical and medium
fertility variant-projected estimates for total deaths
from the United Nations population database.(28) Back-
ground rates were adjusted to account for incremental
increased mortality related to cardiovascular disease. A
range of estimates has been reported for excess mortality
among NAFLD cases, with some studies demonstrat-
ing little increase and others suggesting significantly
elevated cardiovascular mortality.(29-31) A standard mor-
tality ratio of 1.15 (1.00-1.35) was applied to back-
ground mortality rates for all age groups. Liver-related
mortality is more markedly increased in the NAFLD
population and was calculated separately as part of dis-
ease progression modeling.
TRANSPLANTS
Based on Organ Procurement and Transplantation
Network data, there were 6,729 liver transplants per-
formed in the United States in 2014.(32) Of these, 619
were classified as fatty-liver (NASH) cirrhosis.(32) In
addition, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation
Network reports annual transplants classified as cryp-
togenic (idiopathic) cirrhosis. Of the 215 transplants
under this classification in 2014, it was assumed that
42% (90 transplants) were NAFLD-related cases based
on obesity rates among cases with this diagnosis.(9)
The annual number of transplants was assumed to
remain constant after 2014.
Results
NEW NAFLD CASES
The fastest growth in obesity prevalence occurred
during 2000-2002 (Supporting Fig. S4). In compari-
son, the fastest growth in DM prevalence occurred
during 2012-2014, although at a lower magnitude
(Supporting Fig. S4). The increase in DM followed an
increase in obesity after a 10-14-year delay. The
increase in NAFLD cases followed obesity after a 5-8-
year delay, resulting in a modeled peak NAFLD inci-
dence in 2008 when an estimated 4.17 million new
cases occurred (Supporting Fig. S5). Since then, a
slowing rate of increase in NAFLD was forecasted,
and new cases were estimated to decline to 3.62 mil-
lion annually. Thus, the total number of NAFLD cases
is still increasing but at a lower rate compared to the
2005-2008 period.
TOTAL NAFLD POPULATION
The total NAFLD population in 2015 was esti-
mated at 83.1 million cases (Fig. 3A), with a preva-
lence rate of 30.0% among the population aged �15
years and 25.8% among all ages. By 2030, the NAFLD
population was projected to increase 21% to 100.9 mil-
lion cases. Prevalence in 2030 is estimated at 33.5%
(aged �15 years) and 28.4% (all ages). The median age
of the NAFLD population was estimated at 50 years
of age (2015), increasing to 55 years (2030). During
2015-2030, there would be 1.2 prevalent NAFLD
cases among male individuals for every 1.0 among
female individuals.

 STEATOSIS-ONLY POPULATION
The NAFL population classified as steatosis only
included those who have not progressed to NASH as
well as cases regressed from NASH status. This popu-
lation increased 11% from 66.6 million cases in 2015
to 73.9 million in 2030 (Fig. 4). The total number of
fibrotic (�F1) cases among the NAFL-prevalent pop-
ulation was estimated at 113,000 in 2015 (0.17% of
steatosis-only population) and increased to 178,000
cases (0.24% of steatosis-only population) by 2030
(Fig. 4). Among this group, there were an estimated
2,110 cases with cirrhosis or HCC in 2015, increasing
164% to 5,580 prevalent cases in 2030.
Annual incident NAFL cases were assumed to be
the number of individuals developing hepatic steatosis
in a given year and not the number of newly diagnosed
cases. In 2015, an estimated 3.44 million incident
NAFL cases occurred. By 2030, incident NAFL cases
decreased 31% to 2.50 million. Peak incident cases
occurred in 2008 with 4.17 million annual cases. The
gradual decline in new cases is reflective of slowing in
the growth of the obese population.(33) While the
annual number of incident NAFL cases declined since
2008 in the model, the number of prevalent cases and
the prevalence rate continued to increase, albeit at a
slower rate than in decades past.
NASH POPULATION
The number of NASH cases is projected to increase
63% from 16.52 million cases in 2015 to 27.00 million
in 2030 (Fig. 3B). The proportion of NAFLD cases
classified as NASH is expected to increase from 20%
to 27%, a reflection of disease progression, increasing
proportion of diabetic individuals, and an aging

 population. Among NASH cases in 2015, an estimated
20% have F3/F4 fibrosis or advanced liver disease,
encompassing approximately 3.31 million cases (Fig. 4).
By 2030, this number is expected to increase over 160%
to 7.94 million cases and will account for 29% of
NASH cases. Compensated cirrhosis cases among the
NASH population increased 163% from 1.16 million
cases to 3.05 million during 2015-2030. Increases were
relatively smaller for earlier fibrosis stages; F3 cases
increased 124% to 4.49 million cases in 2030, F2
increased 82% (6.13 million in 2030), F1 increased 43%
(9.05 million in 2030), and F0 increased only 11% to
3.88 million cases by 2030 (Fig. 4).
DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS
The prevalent number of decompensated cirrhosis
cases increases 180% from 134,400 cases in 2015 to
376,100 by 2030. Incident decompensated cirrhosis is
forecasted to increase by 168%, from 39,320 cases annu-
ally in 2015 to 105,430 cases in 2030, while cumulative
incidence during 2015-2030 was estimated at 1.10 mil-
lion cases (Fig. 5). The cumulative incidence is much
higher than the prevalent population due to the high
mortality rate. Liver transplant cases (including previously
transplanted minus mortality) were estimated to increase
59% from 4,780 to 7,610 cases during 2015-2030;
however, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the
availability and allocation of donor organs in future years.
HCC
Prevalent HCC cases are expected to increase from
10,100 to 24,900 during 2015-2030, an increase of
146%, while incident HCC cases are expected to increase
by 137% from 5,160 to 12,240 in 2030 (Fig. 5). The
cumulative incidence of HCC during 2015-2030 was
estimated at 135,000 cases, much higher than prevalent
cases due to high mortality. In 2015, 3,280 incident
HCC cases were estimated to have progressed from com-
pensated cirrhosis (64% of total), with the remaining
1,880 incident cases occurring among �F3 cases. By
2030, 8,790 incident HCC cases occurred among com-
pensated cirrhotic cases or 72% of the annual incidence,
reflecting aging and disease progression.

 comparison, the model predicted 17,720 incident
HCC cases during the same time period.
Modeling suggests that the proportion of HCC
cases in the United States attributable to NAFLD has
increased since 2009 and will likely increase in the
coming decades. SEER projects 39,230 incident liver
and intrahepatic bile duct cancers in 2016.(35) Assum-
ing that 72% of incident cancers are classified as
HCC,(34) there would be an estimated 28,250 incident
HCC cases in 2016. The model predicts 5,510 inci-
dent HCC cases in 2016 attributable to NAFLD,
approximately 20% of projected total HCC incidence
in the United States compared to the 12.6%-15.8%
reported in the literature for 2004-2009.(1) SEER also
estimates 27,170 deaths attributable to liver and intra-
hepatic bile duct cancers in 2016. Using the same
assumption for the proportion of HCC, there would
be an estimated 19,560 HCC deaths in 2016. The
model predicts 4,460 liver-related deaths among the
HCC population in 2016, equivalent to 23% of total
projected HCC deaths. A higher proportion of HCC
mortality compared to HCC incidence is consistent
with studies demonstrating relatively higher mortality
among NAFLD-attributable HCC compared to other
etiologies.(1)
MORTALITY
Total deaths among the NAFLD population in
2015 are estimated at 1.27 million with 85.0% classi-
fied as general background, 12.8% as excess cardiovas-
cular, and 2.2% (28,200 deaths) as excess liver-related
deaths. By 2030, total deaths are projected to increase
44%
to
1.83
million
deaths
annually.
General
background and excess cardiovascular deaths will
account for 83.2% and 12.5% of deaths, respectively.
Liver deaths are projected at 78,300 in 2030, an
increase of 178% from 2015 (Fig. 5). Among an esti-
mated cumulative 24.90 million deaths during 2015-
2030, over 3% (799,900 deaths) will represent excess
liver-related mortality. Deaths attributed to HCC
(110,900 deaths) were estimated to account for 14% of
liver
deaths,
whereas
decompensated
cirrhosis
accounted for 85% (683,400 deaths), and the remain-
ing 5,590 liver deaths were projected to occur among
the liver transplant population. Among NAFLD cases
classified as cirrhotic, HCC, or transplant, a higher
proportion of deaths were liver related. In these groups,
there were a total of 78,400 deaths in 2015 and 28,200
(36%) were liver related, increasing to 206,300 total
deaths in 2030, of which 38% (78,300 deaths) were
liver related. If compensated cirrhosis cases were
excluded from the estimates, over 80% of all deaths
during the time period in this group would be liver
related.
MORTALITY IN THE NAFL
POPULATION
Among the population with steatosis only, 902,300
total deaths occurred in 2015, increasing 23% to
1,109,600 by 2030. During 2015-2030, there was a
total of 16,335,400 deaths; 2,130,700 were classified as
excess cardiovascular attributable to the elevated mor-
tality risk in this population compared to the general

 It was assumed that all liver-related deaths occurred
among the NASH population. Extrapolation based on
estimated rates of disease progression among the
steatosis-only population suggests that <0.2% of liver-
related deaths in 2015 would occur among NAFLD
cases without NASH (e.g., NASH regressors).
MORTALITY IN THE NASH
POPULATION
In 2015, there were an estimated 370,000 deaths
among the NASH population, equivalent to 29% of
total NAFLD deaths; this reflects the advanced age
and increased rates of liver disease in this population.
By 2030, nearly 40% of deaths among NAFLD cases
occurred among the NASH population, approximately
716,800 annual deaths. During 2015-2030, >90% of
all deaths in the NASH population was classified as
general background or excess cardiovascular.
There were an estimated 28,200 liver-related deaths
among the NASH population (7.6% of total deaths) in
2015, increasing to 78,300 or 10.9% of total deaths in
2030. Excess cardiovascular deaths comprised approxi-
mately 13% of overall mortality during 2015-2030
(1,012,400 total deaths), and the proportion did not
change substantially during the time period.
Discussion
This study represents a modeling approach to fore-
cast the current and future burden of disease due to
NAFLD in the United States, incorporating real-
world surveillance data for HCC incidence and other
outcomes to validate the results. As the national obe-
sity prevalence levels off, it is estimated that the preva-
lence of NAFLD will also level off. However, the
proportion of subjects within the NAFLD population
with NASH is likely to continue to rise through 2030
based on the rising prevalence of DM. The proportion
of diabetic subjects with NASH is higher than in a
general obese population(10,18,36); thus, the total bur-
den of disease due to NASH will likely rise for the
next 15 years.
The current analysis has several potential implica-
tions. First, if effective strategies to prevent or treat
NASH are not introduced, an exponential increase in
mortality related to NASH is expected. This trend is
supported by literature documenting the growing con-
tribution of NASH as an etiology for end-stage liver
disease requiring transplantation.(1,9) Liver transplan-
tation, however, is expensive, and many subjects with
NASH-related cirrhosis will not qualify for liver trans-
plantation due to associated comorbidities. Further-
more, the total number of liver transplants that can be
performed is limited by the availability of organs.(32)
The increase in the number of individuals with decom-
pensated cirrhosis may thus swamp the supply of
organs and is likely to pose a major public health prob-
lem related to organ availability for other liver diseases.
Another important implication of the model is the
projected increase in the number of individuals with
cirrhosis, especially decompensated cirrhosis due to
NASH. It is already well established that the manage-
ment of cirrhosis is resource intensive and is a major
drain on hospital resources, adding to the cost of
care.(37,38) The projected rise in the number of patients
with decompensated cirrhosis will have a commensu-
rate impact on hospital resources and the overall cost
of health care. Depending on the distribution of unin-
sured or inadequately insured individuals within the
population, this is likely to strain the health care bud-
get for such populations. Even in health systems with
substantial
coverage,
such
as
the
Veterans
Ad-
ministration,(39) the burden of cirrhosis is substantial
and poses a major emotional and financial burden on
subjects and their caregivers. These will contribute to a
ripple effect magnifying the negative consequences of
the increase in number of subjects with cirrhosis due to
NASH.
Insurance claim data indicate that NAFLD is already
the principal etiology contributing to the burden of
HCC.(1) Yet another negative consequence of the grow-
ing burden of NAFLD is likely to be a further increase
in HCC. The output of this model is concordant with
projections from the SEER data (Supporting Section
S2). While this cancer can theoretically be treated effec-
tively by early identification and liver transplantation,
most patients are detected at a stage where liver trans-
plantation is not an option.(40) Furthermore, most
patients with the disease remain undiagnosed and there-
fore progress silently until a diagnosis is made due to
serendipity or when a major complication occurs. The
problem is further heightened by a current lack of effec-
tive preventive strategies for HCC in subjects with
cirrhosis.(40) There is therefore a need to tackle the
problem of HCC at multiple levels.
A unique aspect of the current analysis is that it
accounts for competing mortality due to background
and excess cardiovascular mortality in this population.
Despite this, there will clearly be a substantial increase
in liver-related mortality in those afflicted by NASH.
A critical factor that is likely to drive the increase in

 NASH-related mortality is the increased number and
proportion of subjects who will have cirrhosis. This is
linked to both the aging of the population, which is a
known risk factor for having more advanced disease,(5)
and the natural progression of the disease toward more
advanced stages.(4,14) Importantly, in this study, spon-
taneous regression was estimated from published liter-
ature and back calculation and then applied to the
prevalent population in order to generate the most
accurate projections for disease progression possible.
As with many models, the utility of the model is
linked to the validity of the inputs into the model. The
interpretation of this and other models attempting to
address the burden of NAFLD are limited by the
inability to accurately diagnose steatohepatitis with
simple
epidemiologic
tools.
Thus,
even
in
the
NHANES data set, the assumptions about NASH are
based on a moderately accurate post-hoc application of
liver enzymes and clinical aids in the NAFLD popula-
tion.(22,41) Similarly, the fibrosis stages in population-
based studies represent best estimates based on the use
of clinical aids, such as the Fibrosis-4, Aspartate Ami-
notransferase to Platelet Ratio Index, and NAFLD
fibrosis scores.(21,42,43) Studies with histologic assess-
ment are also limited due to ascertainment bias and
inherent
variability
in
histologic
assessment
of
NAFLD stage and activity. Moreover, the bulk of the
literature on fibrosis progression rates is based on ret-
rospective analysis of various cohorts. The projected
increase in DM by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention is also likely to impact the fibrosis pro-
gression rates, given the close link between DM and
fibrosis in those with NAFLD.(44,45)
Given these uncertainties, we performed an exhaus-
tive literature search (list provided in Supporting Sec-
tion S6) and used conservative estimates representing
the middle ground in the field and paid particular
attention to the available data from placebo arms of
published, prospective, randomized clinical trials. It is
reassuring that a prospective study of transient elastog-
raphy in the general population demonstrated that of
those with DM and steatosis defined by the continu-
ous attenuation parameter, 17.2% had a liver stiffness
�8 kPA, indicative of clinically significant fibrosis.(45)
These data are relatively similar to multiple biopsy-
based studies.(21,23-25) The projections on the preva-
lence of F3/F4 fibrosis are also aligned with recent
assessments from the NHANES data.(22) As new data
with more accurate estimates of fibrosis progression
rates become available, the model will need to be
refined.
Another limitation to this analysis relates to uncer-
tainty around projections for NAFLD-related ad-
vanced liver disease, HCC, and mortality. While the
number of incident HCC cases and liver transplants
attributed to NAFLD is increasing, this is potentially a
result of greater recognition and accuracy in classifying
such cases. If this is true, then modeling validated
using national surveillance data for incident HCC
could overstate the increasing trajectory of disease bur-
den and mortality. A follow-up study of NAFLD cases
from the NHANES III cohort for a median of 14.5
years did not find elevated mortality (general, cardio-
vascular, or liver-related)(46); however, such results are
potentially the result of insufficient length of follow-
up.(47) Given that cases of advanced liver disease and
related mortality form a small portion of the total
NAFLD population and that such cases can take many
years to experience disease progression, there are nota-
ble limitations to follow-up studies focused on the gen-
eral NAFLD population. As such, there is uncertainty
around projections of future burden of NAFLD-
related advanced liver disease and mortality.
Compared to the model presented by Younossi
et al.,(12) our model presents similarities and differ-
ences. The models differed in the number of disease
states as well as disease-state transition and mortality
rates (Supporting Fig. S2). However, both models
were calibrated to published data whenever accurate
estimates were available. The current model is dy-
namic, assessing changes over time in NAFLD inci-
dence using obesity and DM trends. This differs from
steady-state models that assume constant transition
rates. The models also differ in the estimated total
number of NAFLD and NASH cases. This is largely
due to the assumption used in the current model of
increasing incidence of NAFLD based on substantial
increases in adult obesity and DM cases since the col-
lection of NHANES III data, while NAFLD preva-
lence in the prior model is reflective of data from
NHANES III. In addition, the previous model in-
cludes progression to NASH as an input, while the
current model bases fibrosis progression on NASH
prevalence and assumptions for the proportion of
NASH in each fibrosis stage. The overall results of
both models are consistent; they demonstrate that
NAFLD and NASH prevalence, along with resulting
advanced liver disease, are increasing over time,
highlighting the need for action to mitigate disease
burden.

liver disease associated with NAFLD/NASH, using

 national surveillance data for end-stage liver disease to
validate the model. It underscores the need for public
health measures to more accurately define disease prev-
alence, development of surveillance strategies, and
eventually preventive and therapeutic approaches to
tackle this health care challenge.
