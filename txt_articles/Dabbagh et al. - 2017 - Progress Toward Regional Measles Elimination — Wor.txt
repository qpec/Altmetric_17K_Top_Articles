The fourth United Nations Millennium Development Goal, 
adopted in 2000, set a target to reduce child mortality by two 
thirds by 2015. One indicator of progress toward this target was 
measles vaccination coverage (1). In 2010, the World Health 
Assembly (WHA) set three milestones for measles control 
by 2015: 1) increase routine coverage with the first dose of 
a measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) among children aged 
1 year to ≥90% at the national level and to ≥80% in every 
district; 2) reduce global annual measles incidence to <5 cases 
per million population; and 3) reduce global measles mortality 
by 95% from the 2000 estimate (2).* In 2012, WHA endorsed 
the Global Vaccine Action Plan,† with the objective of elimi-
nating measles in four World Health Organization (WHO) 
regions by 2015 and in five regions by 2020. Countries in 
all six WHO regions have adopted goals for measles elimina-
tion by or before 2020. Measles elimination is defined as the 
absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a region or 
other defined geographic area for ≥12 months, in the pres-
ence of a high quality surveillance system that meets targets 
of key performance indicators. This report updates a previous 
report (3) and describes progress toward global measles con-
trol milestones and regional measles elimination goals during 
2000–2016. During this period, annual reported measles 
incidence decreased 87%, from 145 to 19 cases per million 
persons, and annual estimated measles deaths decreased 84%, 
from 550,100 to 89,780; measles vaccination prevented an 
estimated 20.4 million deaths. However, the 2015 milestones 
have not yet been met; only one WHO region has been veri-
fied as having eliminated measles. Improved implementation 
of elimination strategies by countries and their partners is 
needed, with focus on increasing vaccination coverage through 
substantial and sustained additional investments in health 
systems, strengthening surveillance systems, using surveillance 
data to drive programmatic actions, securing political commit-
ment, and raising the visibility of measles elimination goals.
* The coverage milestone is to be met by every country, whereas the incidence 
and mortality reduction milestones are to be met globally.
† The Global Vaccine Action Plan is the implementation plan of the Decade of 
Vaccines, a collaboration between WHO; the United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF); the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases; the African Leaders Malaria Alliance; Gavi, 
the Vaccine Alliance; and others to extend the full benefit of immunization to 
all persons by 2020 and beyond. In addition to 2015 targets, it also set a target 
for measles and rubella elimination in five of the six WHO regions by 2020.

Immunization Activities
To estimate coverage with MCV1 and the second dose of 
measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) through routine immu-
nization services,§ WHO and the United Nations Children’s 
Fund (UNICEF) use data from administrative records (admin-
istrative coverage is calculated by dividing the vaccine doses 
administered by the estimated target population) and immu-
nization coverage surveys reported annually by 194 countries. 
During 2000–2016, estimated MCV1 coverage increased 
globally from 72% to 85% (Table 1), although coverage has 
not increased since 2009. Considerable variability in regional 
coverage exists. Since 2012, MCV1 coverage has remained 
essentially unchanged in the African Region (AFR) (72%), 
the Region of the Americas (AMR) (92%), and the Eastern 
Mediterranean Region (EMR) (77%). In the European Region 
(EUR), MCV1 coverage has declined from 95% to 93% since 
2012, with 51% of EUR member states reporting lower cover-
age since 2013. In the South-East Asia Region (SEAR), MCV1 
coverage increased slightly since 2012, from 84% to 87%. 
The Western Pacific Region (WPR) is the only region that has 
achieved and sustained MCV1 coverage >95% (since 2008). 
Since 2000, the number of countries with MCV1 coverage of 
≥90% increased globally from 85 (44%) in 2000 to 119 (61%) 
in 2015, and to 123 (63%) in 2016. However, among countries 
with ≥90% MCV1 coverage nationally, the percentage with 
≥80% MCV1 coverage in all districts declined from 46% (52 
of 112) in 2010 to 45% (49 of 110) in 2015 and 36% (44 
of 123) in 2016. Among the estimated 20.8 million infants 
who did not receive MCV1 through routine immunization 
services in 2016, approximately 11 million (53%) were in six 
countries with large birth cohorts and suboptimal coverage: 
Nigeria (3.3 million), India (2.9 million), Pakistan (2.0 mil-
lion), Indonesia (1.2 million), Ethiopia (0.9 million), and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (0.7 million).
During 2000–2016, the number of countries providing 
MCV2 nationally through routine services increased from 
98 (51%) to 164 (85%), with four countries (Guatemala, 
Haiti, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste) introducing 
MCV2 in 2016. Estimated global MCV2 coverage steadily

* Mortality estimates for 2000 might be different from previous reports. When the model used to generate estimated measles deaths is rerun each year using the new 
WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage data, as well as updated surveillance data, adjusted results for each year, including the baseline year, 
are also produced and updated.

§ Reported case data: measles cases (2016) from World Health Organization, as of July 15, 2017 (http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/
timeseries/tsincidencemeasles.html). Reported cases are a sizeable underestimate of the actual number of cases, accounting for the inconsistency between reported 
cases and estimated deaths.

data on measles cases for that year was removed from both the numerator and denominator.
increased from 15% in 2000 to 60% in 2015 and 64% in 
2016 (Table 1). During 2016, approximately 119 million 
persons received supplementary doses of measles-contain-
ing vaccine (MCV) during 33 mass immunization cam-
paigns, known as supplementary immunization activities 
(SIAs),¶ implemented in 31 countries (Table 2). Based on 
doses administered, SIA coverage was ≥95% in 20 (61%) 
SIAs. Among the six countries that conducted post-SIA 
coverage surveys, estimated coverage was ≥95% in three, 
90%–94% in two, and 84% in one.
¶ Supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) generally are carried out using 
two target age ranges. An initial, nationwide catch-up SIA focuses on all children 
aged 9 months–14 years, with the goal of eliminating susceptibility to measles 
in the general population. Periodic follow-up SIAs then focus on all children 
born since the last SIA. Follow-up SIAs generally are conducted nationwide 
every 2–4 years and focus on children aged 9–59 months; their goal is to 
eliminate any measles susceptibility that has developed in recent birth cohorts 
and to protect children who did not respond to MCV1.
Disease Incidence
Countries report the aggregate number of incident measles 
cases**,†† to WHO and UNICEF annually through the Joint 
Reporting Form. In 2016, 189 (97%) countries conducted 
 
** http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/
tsincidencemeasles.html.
 
†† Measles cases are defined differently in different countries. Some countries 
define measles cases as those that are laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically 
linked; others define measles cases as those that are laboratory-confirmed, 
epidemiologically linked, or clinically compatible. Laboratory-confirmed cases 
are suspected measles cases with specimens that have detectable measles virus-
specific immunoglobulin class M (IgM) antibodies, or specimens from which 
measles virus can be isolated or measles virus genome can be detected in 
appropriate clinical specimens by a proficient laboratory. Epidemiologically 
linked confirmed measles cases are suspected measles cases that have not been 
confirmed by a laboratory but are geographically and temporally related to a 
laboratory-confirmed case or, in the event of a chain of transmission, to another 
epidemiologically confirmed measles case, with dates of rash onset between 
cases occurring 7–21 days apart. Clinically compatible measles cases are 
suspected measles cases with fever and maculopapular rash and cough, coryza, 
or conjunctivitis, for which no adequate clinical specimen was collected and 
which have not been linked epidemiologically to a laboratory-confirmed case 
of measles or to a laboratory-confirmed case of another communicable disease.

* SIAs generally are carried out using two approaches: 1) An initial, nationwide catch-up SIA targets all children aged 9 months to 14 years; it has the goal of eliminating 
susceptibility to measles in the general population. Periodic follow-up SIAs then target all children born since the last SIA. 2) Follow-up SIAs are generally conducted 
nationwide every 2–4 years and target children aged 9–59 months; their goal is to eliminate any measles susceptibility that has developed in recent birth cohorts 
and to protect children who did not respond to the first measles vaccination. The exact age range for follow-up SIAs depends on the age-specific incidence of 
measles, coverage with 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine, and the time since the last SIA.

case-based surveillance in at least part of the country, and 191 
(98%) had access to standardized quality-controlled testing 
through the WHO Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory 
Network. Nonetheless, surveillance was weak in many coun-
tries; fewer than half of countries (64 of 134; 48%) achieved 
the sensitivity indicator target of two or more discarded measles 
and rubella§§ cases per 100,000 population in 2016 compared 
with 2015 (80 of 135; 59%).
§§ A discarded case is defined as a suspected case that has been investigated and 
discarded as nonmeasles and as nonrubella using 1) laboratory testing in a 
proficient laboratory or 2) epidemiological linkage to a laboratory-confirmed 
outbreak of a communicable disease that is not measles or rubella. The 
discarded case rate is used to measure the sensitivity of measles surveillance.

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
During 2000–2016, the number of measles cases reported 
annually worldwide decreased 85%, from 853,479 in 2000 
to 214,812 in 2015 and then to 132,137 in 2016; measles 
incidence decreased 87%, from 145 to 19 cases per 1 million 
population (Table 1). Compared with 2015, 2016 incidence 
decreased from 29 to 19 cases per million, although three fewer 
countries (173 of 194; 89%) reported case data in 2016 than 
did in 2015 (176 of 194; 92%).¶¶ The percentage of reporting 
countries with fewer than five measles cases per million popula-
tion increased from 38% (64/169) in 2000 to 69% (119/173) 
in 2016. During 2000–2016, measles incidence of fewer than 
five cases per million was sustained in AMR (Table 1).
During 2015–2016, the number of reported measles cases 
declined globally and in all regions (AFR, 31%; AMR, 98%; 
EMR, 71%; EUR, 84%; SEAR, 44%, and WPR, 11%). In 
addition to aggregate reporting, countries report measles 
case-based data to WHO monthly. In some countries large 
discrepancies exist between the two reporting systems. During 
2016, some countries either did not report or reported only a 
fraction of monthly reported measles cases through the Joint 
Reporting Form (e.g., India reported 70,798 measles cases 
through monthly reporting, but only 17,250 through the Joint 
Reporting Form).
Genotypes of viruses isolated from measles cases were 
reported by 60 (55%) of the 110 countries that reported at least 
one measles case in 2016. Among the 24 recognized measles 
virus genotypes, 11 were detected during 2005–2008, eight 
during 2009–2014, six in 2015, and five in 2016, excluding 
those from vaccine reactions and cases of subacute sclerosing 
panencephalitis, a fatal progressive neurologic disorder caused 
by persistent measles infection (4).*** In 2016, among 4,796 
reported measles virus sequences,††† 666 were genotype B3 
(36 countries); 44 were D4 (four); 1,407 were D8 (43); 87 
were D9 (four); and 2,592 were H1 (13).
Disease and Mortality Estimates
A previously described model for estimating measles disease 
and mortality was updated with new measles vaccination 
coverage data, case data, and United Nations population 
estimates for all countries during 2000–2016, enabling deri-
vation of a new series of disease and mortality estimates (5). 
Based on the updated data, the estimated number of measles 
cases declined from 29,068,400 (95% confidence interval 
 ¶¶ Twenty-one countries did not report measles case data in 2016: Antigua and 
Barbuda, Belgium, Cabo Verde, Cook Islands, Ireland, Italy, Kiribati, 
Marshall Islands, Monaco, Morocco, Mozambique, Nauru, Niue, Poland, 
Portugal, Samoa, Singapore, Switzerland, Tuvalu, United States, and Vanuatu.

CI = 4,190,500–28,657,300) in 2016. During this period, 
the number of estimated measles deaths declined 84%, from 
550,100 (95% CI = 374,000–896,500) in 2000 to 89,780 
(95% CI = 45,700–269,600) in 2016 (Table 1). Compared 
with no measles vaccination, measles vaccination prevented 
an estimated 20.4 million deaths during 2000–2016 (Figure).
Regional Verification of Measles Elimination
In 2016, four WHO regions had functioning regional veri-
fication commissions. In September 2016, the AMR regional 
verification commission declared the region free of endemic 
measles (6). In 2016, the EUR commission verified measles 
elimination in 24 countries (7). Two SEAR countries (Bhutan 
and Maldives) were verified as having eliminated measles in 
2017 (8). The WPR commission reclassified Mongolia as hav-
ing reestablished endemic measles virus transmission because of 
an outbreak that lasted >12 months; thus, five WPR countries 
(Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, Japan, and South Korea) and 
two areas (Macao Special Autonomous Region [SAR] [China] 
and Hong Kong SAR [China]) had verified measles elimina-
tion status in 2016 (9).
Discussion
During 2000–2016, increased coverage with MCV admin-
istered through routine immunization programs worldwide, 
combined with SIAs, contributed to an 87% decrease in 
reported measles incidence and an 84% reduction in estimated 
measles mortality. Measles vaccination prevented an estimated 
20.4 million deaths during this period, and during 2016, for 
the first time ever, estimated measles deaths declined to fewer 
than 100,000. Furthermore, the number of countries with 
measles incidence of fewer than five per million population 
has increased, although considerable underreporting occurred, 
and AMR has maintained an incidence of fewer than five cases 
per million population during 2000–2016. The decreasing 
number of circulating measles virus genotypes suggests inter-
ruption of some chains of transmission. However, the 2015 
global control milestones were not met, global MCV1 coverage 
has stagnated, global MCV2 coverage has reached only 64%, 
and SIA quality was inadequate to achieve ≥95% coverage in 
several countries. With suboptimal MCV coverage, outbreaks 
continued to occur among unvaccinated persons, including 
school-aged children and young adults.
The 2016 Mid-term Review of the Global Measles and 
Rubella Strategic Plan 2012–2020 concluded that measles 
elimination strategies were sound, and the WHO Strategic 
Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization endorsed its 
findings. The review noted, however, that implementation of 
the strategies needs improvement. Measures should focus on

strengthening immunization and surveillance systems. The 
Measles and Rubella Initiative should increase its emphasis on 
using surveillance data to drive programmatic actions.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, SIA coverage data might be biased by inaccurate 
reports of the number of doses delivered, doses administered to 
children outside the target age group, and inaccurate estimates 
of the target population size. Second, large differences between 
the estimated and reported incidence indicate variable surveil-
lance sensitivity, making comparisons between countries and 
regions difficult to interpret. Finally, the accuracy of the results 
from the measles mortality model is affected by biases in all 
model inputs, including country-specific measles vaccination 
coverage and measles case-based surveillance data.
The decrease in measles mortality to fewer than 100,000 
deaths in 2016 is one of five main contributors (along with 
decreases in mortality from diarrhea, malaria, pneumonia, 
and neonatal intrapartum deaths) to the decline in overall 
child mortality worldwide and progress toward the fourth 
United Nations Millennium Development Goal, but con-
tinued work is needed to help achieve measles elimination 
goals (10). Of concern is the possibility that the gains made 
and future progress in measles elimination could be reversed 
when polio-funded resources supporting routine immunization 
services, measles SIAs, and measles surveillance diminish and 
disappear after polio eradication. Countries with the highest 
measles mortality rely most heavily on polio-funded resources 
and are at highest risk for reversal of progress after polio eradi-
cation is achieved. Improved implementation of elimination 
strategies by countries and their partners is needed, with focus 
on increasing vaccination coverage with substantial and sus-
tained additional investments in health systems, strengthening 
surveillance systems, using surveillance data to drive program-
matic actions, securing political commitment, and raising the 
visibility of measles elimination goals.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The fourth United Nations Millennium Development Goal, 
adopted in 2000, set a target to reduce child mortality by 
two thirds by 2015. One indicator of progress toward this target 
was measles vaccination coverage. 
What is added by this report?
For the first time, annual estimated measles deaths were fewer 
than 100,000, in 2016. This achievement follows an increase in 
the number of countries providing the second dose of measles-
containing vaccine (MCV2) nationally through routine immuni-
zation services to 164 (85%) of 194 countries, and the 
vaccination of approximately 119 million persons against 
measles during supplementary immunization activities in 2016. 
During 2000–2016, annual reported measles incidence 
decreased 87%, from 145 to 19 cases per million persons, 
annual estimated measles deaths decreased 84%, from 550,100 
to 89,780, and an estimated 20.4 million deaths were prevented. 
However, the 2015 measles elimination milestones have not yet 
been met, and only one World Health Organization region has 
been verified as having eliminated measles.
What are the implications for public health practice?
To achieve measles elimination goals, countries and their 
partners need to act urgently to secure political commitment, 
raise the visibility of measles elimination, increase vaccination 
coverage, strengthen surveillance, and mitigate the threat of 
decreasing resources once polio eradication is achieved. Polio 
eradication resources have supported routine immunization 
services and surveillance activities.
