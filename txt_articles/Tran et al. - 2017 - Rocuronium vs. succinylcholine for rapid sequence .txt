Summary
This systemic review was performed to determine whether rocuronium creates intubating conditions comparable to
those of succinylcholine during rapid sequence intubation of the trachea. We searched the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to February Week 2 2015), and EMBASE (1988 to
February 14 2015) for any randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials that reported intubating condi-
tions comparing rocuronium and succinylcholine for rapid or modified rapid sequence intubation. The dose of
rocuronium was at least 0.6 mg.kg�1 and succinylcholine was at least 1 mg.kg�1. Sixty-six studies were identified
and 50 included, representing 4151 participants. Overall, succinylcholine was superior to rocuronium for achieving
excellent intubating conditions (risk ratio (95%CI) 0.86 (0.81 to 0.92), n = 4151) and clinically acceptable intubation
conditions (risk ratio (95%CI) 0.97 (0.95–0.99), n = 3992). A high incidence of detection bias amongst the trials cou-
pled with significant heterogeneity means that the quality of evidence was moderate for these conclusions. Succinyl-
choline was more likely to produce excellent intubating conditions when using thiopental as the induction agent: risk
ratio (95%CI) 0.81 (0.73–0.88), n = 2302) with or without the use of opioids (risk ratio (95%CI) 0.85 (0.78–0.93),
n = 2292 or 0.85 (0.76–0.95), n = 1428).

 Introduction
Patients who need tracheal intubation in the emer-
gency department or the operating room often require
a
rapid
sequence
induction
technique
to
protect
against aspiration of gastric contents or to facilitate
urgent airway protection in cases of imminent airway
closure, haemodynamic instability, failing gas exchange
and surgical emergencies [1–4]. The rapid sequence
intubation technique involves the prompt sequential
administration of a predetermined dose of hypnotic
agent and muscle relaxant followed by tracheal intuba-
tion within 1 min of giving the muscle relaxant [5].
Frequently, modifications of this sequence are made,
such as: titration of the hypnotic agent in situations of
haemodynamic instability; the addition of an opioid to
attenuate airway reflexes; and the addition of sedatives
to induce amnesia (all hereafter termed ‘modified’
rapid sequence intubation).
Succinylcholine,
a
depolarising
neuromuscular
blocking agent, has traditionally been the most com-
monly used drug for a rapid sequence intubation
technique in both the routine and emergency settings
[6]. Its rapid onset (40–60 s) and short duration of
action (6–10 min) are advantages that have to be bal-
anced
against
the
risk
of
hyperkalemia,
variable
increases in intracranial pressure [7] and, to a lesser
extent, intra-ocular pressure [8]. As a result, succinyl-
choline is contra-indicated in major burns or crush
injuries, severe abdominal sepsis, denervation syn-
dromes, muscular dystrophy, malignant hyperthermia
or in the presence of a previous allergic reaction to
succinylcholine [9–13].
Alternative agents include pancuronium, vecuro-
nium, atracurium and cisatracurium; however, none
achieve acceptable intubating conditions as rapidly as
succinylcholine. Rocuronium is a steroid-based non-
depolarising muscle relaxant, which has been used to
create intubating conditions similar to those of suc-
cinylcholine. The duration of action is longer (37–
72 min with standard doses [14]). The only absolute
contra-indication to rocuronium is allergy. Care must
be taken with people who have myasthenia gravis or
myasthenic syndrome, hepatic disease, neuromuscular
disease, carcinomatosis, or severe cachexia, as the
duration of action may be profoundly increased [3].
There have been many studies comparing rocuro-
nium and succinylcholine; these have produced con-
flicting outcomes. It has been suggested that variation
in the use of opioids, the hypnotic agent used (propo-
fol, thiopental, etomidate), or the dose of rocuronium
given may have accounted for these differences [14].
The intentions of this review are to determine whether
rocuronium creates intubating conditions comparable
to those of succinylcholine during rapid sequence intu-
bation, and to perform subgroup analyses to assess for
sources of inconsistency between studies. This review
is important as rocuronium is becoming more widely
used as a substitute for succinylcholine in rapid
sequence intubation, especially with the introduction
of a specific reversal agent, sugammadex [15, 16].
Methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE
(1966 to February 14th 2015), and EMBASE (1988 to
February 14th 2015) to identify all clinical trials directly
comparing rocuronium and succinylcholine during
rapid sequence intubation, with no language, sex or age
restrictions. We used the validated randomised con-
trolled trial filter for the search [17]. Please refer to the
Appendices in the full Cochrane review [18] for the
exact search terms and strategy used. We included all
randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and controlled clini-
cal trials (CCTs) meeting the following criteria: a score
of intubation conditions was reported as one of the
main outcomes; rocuronium was compared with suc-
cinylcholine; and the dose of rocuronium administered
was at least 0.6 mg.kg�1 and succinylcholine was at
least 1 mg.kg�1 [19]. We hand searched the reference
lists of included trials to add any citations missed by
the electronic searches. Two independent appraisers
(any two of JP, JL, VM, EN or DT) reviewed titles and
abstracts using the inclusion criteria to assess relevance.
We measured inter-rater agreement regarding article
extraction using the kappa statistic. We resolved all dis-
agreements by consensus. If we could not reach con-
sensus, then a third author (GW or JP) was available to
give a final decision. Once the final list of included
studies
was
confirmed,
data
were
independently
extracted by two authors (JP, JL, VM, EN, or DT) using

 standardised data collection forms. Disagreements were
settled by consensus, with both extractors referring to
the original text together, or by consulting a third
author (JP). All data presented were from published lit-
erature only, with the exception of one report where
the authors provided the exact numbers for intubating
conditions [20]. To minimise introduction of bias, DT
and EN reviewed and assessed all trials included in the
review using the ‘Risk of bias’ tool.
The induction sequence could be either a standard
rapid sequence intubation or ‘modified’ rapid sequence
intubation performed electively or as an emergency.
Our definition of a ‘modified’ rapid sequence intuba-
tion was the use of both a hypnotic agent and a mus-
cle relaxant with changes which might include: a delay
between giving the two drugs; the addition of drugs
before the hypnotic agent; or an elapsed time of more
than 60 s between the administration of the muscle
relaxant and the intubation attempt. The hypnotics
used for the induction of anaesthesia were thiopental,
propofol, ketamine or etomidate. Additional medica-
tions allowed in this review were the use of pre-
treatment sedatives and opioids.
We assessed intubating conditions using the Gold-
berg scale [6, 21] (Table 1). This is a widely used scale
(although not always attributed to Goldberg et al.) that
allocates a score for each of: ease of intubation, vocal
cord movement, and patient response to intubation
(diaphragmatic movement, coughing or bucking). This
scale gives a total value of 12, in which three repre-
sents excellent; four to six represents good; seven to
nine represents poor, and 10 to 12 represents impossi-
ble or inadequate intubation conditions. Thus, for
example, a score of three denotes good conditions
recorded by the operator, open, immobile vocal cords,
and no patient response to intubation. We only
included trials if they reported intubating conditions as
a scale or in components which could be converted to
the Goldberg scale. For trials comparing multiple
drugs, we used only data involving succinylcholine and
rocuronium with the same induction agents. The pri-
mary outcome assessed was the proportion of excellent
intubation conditions created during standard or mod-
ified rapid sequence intubation comparing rocuronium
with succinylcholine. The secondary outcome assessed
was the proportion of clinically acceptable (excellent or
good) intubation conditions created during rapid or
modified rapid sequence intubation comparing rocuro-
nium with succinylcholine.
We used Review Manager (RevMan) software
(Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Cen-
tre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) to perform all
the analyses in this study. Treatment effect was mea-
sured using dichotomous variables as risk ratios (RR)
for both excellent and acceptable intubation condi-
tions, with 95%CI, in a random-effects model. The
unit of analysis was the intubation scores provided by
each of the included trials. Sometimes the distribution
of scores was provided only in graphical format, in
which case we estimated data by reading the graphs
directly. We performed analysis on an intention-to-
treat basis.
Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by using the
I2 statistic with thresholds of 25%, 50% and 75% to
indicate mild, moderate and high degrees of hetero-
geneity respectively [22]. Visual inspection was per-
formed of the graphical representation of the trials
with their 95%CIs. We explored the causes of signifi-
cant heterogeneity with subgroup analyses. Reporting
bias was assessed by visual inspection of a funnel plot
of the included trials.
A priori subgroup analyses for the outcome of excel-
lent intubation conditions compared the following
groups: standard rapid sequence intubation vs. modified
rapid sequence intubation; induction agent; use vs. non-
use of an opioids; doses of rocuronium (0.6, 0.9, or
1.2 mg.kg�1); adults vs. children; and emergency intuba-
tions. After we completed the assessment of bias, we con-
ducted subgroup analyses according to categorisation of

 blinding of outcome assessment to further identify the
source of heterogeneity. In order to assess their impact
on the effect direction, size and precision of the summary
estimate, we conducted sensitivity analyses excluding tri-
als in turn that: contributed most to heterogeneity; were
most heavily weighted; and showed marked differences
in intubation sequence (such as very short time between
delivery of muscle relaxant and intubation).
Results
Using our search protocol, 66 studies in total were
identified, of which 50 trials [2, 6, 8, 14, 20, 23–67]
were analysed, representing 4151 patients (Fig. 1). The
inter-observer agreement regarding article selection
had a j statistic of 0.9. A detailed summary of the
included and excluded studies can be found in the full
Cochrane review [18]; the included studies are also
available as online supplementary material on this
journal’s website. Two studies were excluded because
the outcome could not be converted to the Goldberg
scale. Intubation scores had to be extracted from bar
graphs in 12 (24%) of the studies. Forty-five (90%) of
the included studies involved adults; 30 (60%) studied
patients with an ASA physical status classification of 1

 and 2; 35 (70%) evaluated a modified rapid sequence
intubation and 45 (90%) were conducted in an elective
operating room environment.
Several studies only had part of published data
included in the meta-analysis. The studies by Andrews
[2] and McCourt [28] are two of the largest trials con-
ducted to date. Both trials had to drop the lower dose
rocuronium after the interim analysis, as it was found
to be inferior to the larger dose [35]. Neither trial
reported the results of the low-dose control groups
and thus they are not included in this meta-analysis.
Sparr used four different rocuronium treatment groups
with only one succinylcholine control group [58]; we
have therefore not included the rocuronium groups
with propofol or alfentanil in this meta-analysis (no
control group). Belyamani performed a trial assessing
the benefit of ephedrine on intubating conditions with
either succinylcholine or rocuronium [29]. Of the four
treatment groups, only data from the two control
groups were included in this analysis. De Almeida
enrolled morbidly obese participants who were given
different doses of muscle relaxant based on ideal body
weight versus total body weight [34]. Only data for the
two groups dosed for total body weight were included
in this analysis, because the ideal body weight groups
would have received lower drug doses than those spec-
ified in the inclusion criteria for the review. The sec-
ond
trial
to
involve
emergency
intubations
[46]
compared propofol with etomidate as the induction
agent. The authors did not provide separate data for
the two groups of participants, so this trial was not in
the induction agent analysis. The figures and tables in
T€
urkmen were unavailable, so only data points for
excellent intubation conditions were used for the
meta-analysis [66].
For
each
study,
methodological
details
were
assessed for risk of bias (Fig. 2). With regard to study
allocation, all but one of the trials was described as a
randomised controlled trial [34]. However, the exact
method of randomisation was not always described.
We rated two of the 50 included trials at high risk of
bias for allocation, due to lack of randomisation [34]
and randomisation by arrival sequence for surgery
[38]. The most prevalent area of high risk of bias was
blinding of outcome assessment, resulting in down-
grading of the evidence in the review to ‘moderate’.

 Although many investigators blinded the intubator to
the medication injected, 50% did not blind the asses-
sor. As succinylcholine causes very discernible fascicu-
lations visible to the intubator, this ‘unblinds’ the
study drug and could bias assessment of the primary
outcome.

number of trials on either side of the effect estimate,
although there was more scatter to the left, possibly
indicating a paucity of trials in the lower right quad-
rant representing small unpublished trials favouring
the use of rocuronium (Fig. 3).

(0.81–0.92), 50 studies, 4151 participants, I2 = 72%.
The number needed to treat (95%CI) for an additional
harmful outcome (NNTH) was 8 (12–6). There was
heterogeneity present in this comparison, as demon-
strated graphically with the 95% CIs for each trial. The
chi² test for heterogeneity was significant (Fig. 4). For
the secondary outcome of clinically acceptable intubat-
ing conditions (‘excellent’ or ‘good’) with a risk ratio
(95%CI) 0.97 (0.95–0.99), 48 studies, 3992 patients,
I2 = 68%). An analysis of the influence on heterogene-
ity demonstrated that no single trial, regardless of size,
significantly altered the I² statistic, with the exception
of Kulkarni et al. for the subgroup of modified rapid
sequence intubation [39]. These assessments and the
following
subgroup
analyses
did
not
explain
the
heterogeneity in the trials. However, we did not down-
grade the quality of the evidence because we felt that
the sources of heterogeneity were clinical variables
which contributed to the generalisability of these
results. Detailed results for the subgroup analyses can
be found in the full review [18].
Subgroup analysis comparing standard and ‘modi-
fied’ rapid sequence intubation for the primary out-
come demonstrated that succinylcholine produced a
higher proportion of excellent intubating conditions
with both standard rapid sequence intubation (RR
(95%CI) 0.80 (0.72–0.89), 23 studies, 2535 participants,
I2 = 77%, NNTH (95%CI) 8 (12–6) and modified
rapid sequence intubation (RR (95%CI) 0.92 (0.85–
0.99), 25 studies, 1468 participants, I2 = 60%; NNTH
(95%CI) 8 (11–5). There was significant heterogeneity
present for both subgroups.
The influence of rocuronium dose was explored
for the primary outcome of excellent intubation condi-
tions; this showed that a dose of rocuronium of 0.6–
0.7 mg.kg�1 was less effective than succinylcholine
(RR (95%CI) 0.80 (0.72–0.88), 39 studies, 2808 partici-
pants, I2 = 77%; NNTH (95%CI) 6 (7–5). There were
no statistical differences for excellent or acceptable
intubation conditions in the group that received 0.9–
1.0 mg.kg�1 of rocuronium or the group that received
1.2 mg.kg�1 of rocuronium.
When analysed by induction agent (thiopental vs.
propofol), the thiopental subgroup displayed a prefer-
ence for succinylcholine over rocuronium to produce
excellent
intubation
conditions
(RR

0.81
(0.73–0.88), 28 studies, 2302 participants, I2 = 81%;
NNTH (95%CI) 6 (7–5) (Fig. 5). Further analysis com-
paring the effect of thiopental when used with or with-
out an opioid found that
succinylcholine created
significantly better outcomes both with opioids ((RR
(95%CI) 0.82 (0.73–0.92), 17 studies, 1300 participants,
I2 = 79%) and without (RR (95%CI) 0.80 (0.69–0.94),
12 studies, 1002 participants, I2 = 84%) in sequence
with thiopental. There were no trials that used benzo-
diazepines for induction, comparing rocuronium with
succinylcholine.

conditions whether opioids were used or not. The sub-

conditions (RR (95%CI) 0.86 (0.70–1.06), 5 studies,

participants,
I2 = 81%).
There
was significant
heterogeneity amongst the five paediatric trials.
For the subgroup comparing rocuronium and suc-
cinylcholine in emergency participants (one study in
the intensive care unit and four in the operating
room), there was a statistically significant risk ratio
favouring succinylcholine for excellent intubation con-
ditions (RR (95%CI) 0.84 (0.73–0.98), 5 studies, 1073
participants, I2 = 53%; NNTH (95%CI) 12 (38–7) and
there was no significant heterogeneity between trials.
Discussion
This review summarises the results of 50 trials in 4151
participants [2, 6, 8, 14, 20, 23–67], demonstrating
moderate-quality evidence that succinylcholine creates
better
intubation
circumstances
than
rocuronium.
However, if an alternative agent is required, rocuro-
nium 1 mg.kg�1 can be used to create acceptable intu-
bation conditions but should only be used as a
second-line treatment because paralysis will be signifi-
cantly prolonged. The introduction of sugammadex to
facilitate reversal of rocuronium allows this problem to
be overcome, but this drug is not currently widely
available [68].
We have demonstrated that succinylcholine is
superior to rocuronium when either a standard or
modified rapid sequence intubation technique is used.
Interestingly, thiopental was found to provide superior
intubating conditions with or without the use of an
opioid. Unfortunately, this finding will have limited
clinical applicability in North America, where the
availability of thiopental has become very limited. The
failure of opioids to make a difference to the quality of
intubation conditions is contrary to other research
[59]. The dose of rocuronium has been thought to be
important in creating intubation conditions equivalent
to succinylcholine. Succinylcholine created significantly
more excellent intubation conditions than rocuronium
at doses of 0.6–0.7 mg.kg�1. There was no statistically
significant difference for the 0.9 to 1.0 mg.kg�1 or
1.2 mg.kg�1 groups, reaffirming the current practice of
using 1 mg.kg�1 of rocuronium for rapid sequence
intubation when succinylcholine is not clinically indi-
cated. It is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the
higher doses of rocuronium, as there are relatively few
studies
which
have
examined
the
higher
dose
(1.2 mg.kg�1) of rocuronium (n = 86). At this high
dose, the duration of action of rocuronium becomes
73 min
on
average
[8]
which
can
result
in
an
increased incidence of adverse outcomes. The relatively
recent introduction of a reversal
agent for non-
depolarising muscle relaxants [16] may ameliorate the
features of prolonged muscle blockade, but it has not
been tested in emergency situations [15].
We included a subgroup analysis for participants
undergoing emergency intubation demonstrating that
succinylcholine is superior to rocuronium in creating
excellent intubation conditions. This is consistent with
our findings in the < 60-second time delay subgroup.
There was, however, no significant difference between
groups for the outcome of clinically acceptable intuba-
tion, indicating that in emergency patients for whom
succinylcholine is contraindicated, rocuronium can still
be used to reliably create acceptable intubating condi-
tions.
There was no evidence of a difference in our pri-
mary outcome in the five paediatric trials [30, 39, 47,
51, 61]. However, these had very little power to
demonstrate any statistically significant difference due
to the small sample size (n = 536). In addition, two of
the trials [51, 61] used propofol in the sequence, while
a
third
[47]
used
a
high
dose
of
rocuronium
(1.2 mg.kg�1) which may have confounded the results.
Another trial used ketamine in addition to a benzodi-
azepine as a premedication for particularly young chil-
dren, further confounding the comparison [39].

pants from a wide age range (1–77 years) in a variety

 emergency intubations in the operating room and
intensive care unit. The funnel plot of the included tri-
als indicates a lack of trials in the right lower quad-
rant, which may represent small unpublished trials
favouring the use of rocuronium (Fig. 3). The reason
for such trials not being reported is not evident.
Another reason for the asymmetric funnel plot is
heterogeneous study effects that can be seen with vary-
ing study sizes, intubation sequences and study popu-
lations. It is also possible that despite the inclusive
search strategy, we have missed research not included
in the databases accessible to the English-speaking
community.
With regard to the quality of the evidence pre-
sented, we found a significant amount of heterogeneity
in the analysis of the primary outcome, which we tried
to explore with subgroup analyses by: age; urgency; dose
of rocuronium; timing of muscle relaxant; induction
agent; and opioid use. The I² statistical value never fell
below the 50% thresholds with these sensitivity analyses,
nor did the direction or size of the summary estimate.
As a result, we did not down-grade the quality of evi-
dence, but suggest that the heterogeneity may be
explained by variation in: patient populations; clinical
settings (e.g. elective limb surgery, gastric bypass, emer-
gency intensive care intubations); medications in induc-
tion sequences; and timing of intubation. All of these
contribute to the generalisability of our results, and to
reducing concerns about indirectness of evidence.
Assessments of the risk of biases demonstrate that
the series of trials included in this review are at low
risk of selection and attrition bias. All but one trial
was described as a randomised controlled trial, with
11% of trials being at high risk for lack of allocation
concealment. The area of most concern was the high
incidence of detection bias due to lack of blinding of
the outcome assessor, which led us to downgrade the
quality of evidence to ‘moderate’. Succinylcholine will
cause significant fasciculations, and intubators who are
not blinded to this effect may assign biased scores to
the intubating conditions. We conducted a subgroup
analysis based on the blinding of the outcome assessor
which failed to explain the source of the heterogeneity
in the meta-analysis.
Contrary to the primary findings of our review, a
retrospective review of 327 rapid sequence intubation
intubations using etomidate with rocuronium or suc-
cinylcholine in the emergency department showed
equivalent success at first intubation attempts [69].
Median doses of rocuronium were 1.19 mg.kg�1 and
1.5 mg.kg�1 of succinylcholine. Herbstritt et al. per-
formed a short review looking at use of equivalent
doses of rocuronium and succinylcholine (1 mg.kg�1)
for rapid sequence intubation [70]. They included
seven papers of varying quality (retrospective review,
RCT and meta-analysis), and concluded that there are
no differences in intubating conditions between the
two. This is consistent with our finding in the 0.9–
1.0 mg.kg�1 dose range (RR (95%CI) 0.95 (0.89–1.00),
1458 participants). When using doses of 0.6 mg.kg�1
of rocuronium, Larsen et al. used alfentanil and propo-
fol as their induction agents and found no difference
between rocuronium and succinylcholine 1 mg.kg�1 in
achieving clinically acceptable intubating conditions
[42]. These results are also consistent with those
reported in this review for the secondary outcome (RR
(95%CI) 0.99 (0.96–1.02), 952 participants).
Any further trials comparing succinylcholine and
rocuronium should make certain to blind the outcome
assessor to the fasciculations triggered by succinyl-
choline. Most of the included trials assessed intubation
conditions using ease of laryngoscopy, vocal cord
motion and diaphragmatic movement. These measures
should be maintained to allow for consistent compar-
ison between trials. Although there are now five trials
[2, 20, 42, 46, 47] involving emergency participants,
further trials in this patient population may reveal dif-
ferences in results because etomidate is more often
used as an induction agent than in the operating
room. Finally, there was a lack of reporting of adverse
outcomes in the trials, which should be addressed in
any trials performed in the future.
