ABSTRACT
Background: Different aspects of dietary pattern, including mac-
ronutrient and food profiles, may affect visceral fat mass and met-
abolic syndrome.
Objective: We hypothesized that consuming energy primarily from
carbohydrate or fat in diets with similar food profiles would differ-
entially affect the ability to reverse visceral adiposity and metabolic
syndrome.
Design: Forty-six men (aged 30–50 y) with body mass index (in kg/m2)
.29 and waist circumference .98 cm were randomly assigned
to a very high–fat, low-carbohydrate (VHFLC; 73% of energy fat
and 10% of energy carbohydrate) or low-fat, high-carbohydrate
(LFHC; 30% of energy fat and 53% of energy carbohydrate) diet
for 12 wk. The diets were equal in energy (8750 kJ/d), protein
(17% of energy), and food profile, emphasizing low-processed,
lower-glycemic foods. Fat mass was quantified with computed
tomography imaging.
Results: Recorded intake of carbohydrate and total and saturated fat
in the LFHC and VHFLC groups were 51% and 11% of energy,
29% and 71% of energy, and 12% and 34% of energy, respectively,
with no difference in protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Mean
energy intake decreased by 22% and 14% in the LFHC and VHFLC
groups. The diets similarly reduced waist circumference (11–13 cm),
abdominal subcutaneous fat mass (1650–1850 cm3), visceral fat mass
(1350–1650 cm3), and total body weight (11–12 kg). Both groups
improved dyslipidemia, with reduced circulating triglycerides, but
showed differential responses in total and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (decreased in LFHC group only), and high-density li-
poprotein cholesterol (increased in VHFLC group only). The
groups showed similar reductions in insulin, insulin C-peptide,
glycated hemoglobin, and homeostasis model assessment of insu-
lin resistance. Notably, improvements in circulating metabolic
markers in the VHFLC group mainly were observed first after
8 wk, in contrast to more acute and gradual effects in the
LFHC group.
Conclusions: Consuming energy primarily as carbohydrate or fat
for 3 mo did not differentially influence visceral fat and metabolic
syndrome in a low-processed, lower-glycemic dietary context. Our
data do not support the idea that dietary fat per se promotes ectopic
adiposity and cardiometabolic syndrome in humans. This study was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01750021.

INTRODUCTION
Overweight and obesity cause major health problems world-
wide by contributing to comorbidities such as fatty liver, type 2
diabetes (T2D)9, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and certain
cancers (1). Resistance to the hormone insulin characterizes
metabolic syndrome and the associated risk of CVD and T2D (2, 3).
Key components of metabolic syndrome are increased abdominal
fat mass, elevated circulating triglyceride concentrations, reduced
circulating concentration of HDL cholesterol, and elevated blood
pressure (3). Fat accumulation, particularly in the intra-abdominal
region (visceral adiposity), strongly associates with insulin resistance–
related hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia (4, 5), with or without ac-
companying fatty liver (6). Fat storage depends on dietary habits that

 favor excess energy intake relative to expenditure, largely from
highly palatable foods that typically combine processed carbo-
hydrates and fats (7).
Randomized controlled trials have shown that a sustained
reduction in total energy, either by reducing fat or carbohydrate
intake, can reduce body weight and metabolic syndrome in
overweight and obese individuals (8, 9). Moreover, the health
effects of nutrition partly depend on the types and sources of
carbohydrates and fats, such as high- or low-glycemic–index
foods (10–12), simple or complex sugars (13), and fructose or
glucose (14). Low-carbohydrate or low-glycemic diets have
gained popularity as part of a health-promoting lifestyle, partly
because of the potential for temporary or long-term weight loss
associated with reduced glycemic load and improved insulin
sensitivity (10, 15). Yet, there is concern that an accompanying
increase in the intake of total fat and SFAs may promote adverse
health effects (16, 17), including visceral fat accumulation (18,
19) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (20). The suggested
negative effects of SFAs have largely been attributed to a stim-
ulatory effect on circulating cholesterol (21), in particular LDL
cholesterol (22, 23), as well as inflammation and other mecha-
nisms that interfere with insulin signaling (2, 24, 25). These
purported adverse effects of SFAs have been suspected to persist
even in the context of weight loss (26, 27).
Clinical (and animal) studies exploring the effects of high-fat
diets often include energy-dense diets that also have a substantial
amount of processed carbohydrates and poor overall quality (19),
confounding the effect of a high intake of fat per se (22, 28). Most
previous randomized controlled trials comparing low-carbohydrate
and low-fat diets have been performed with a substantial energy
restriction (outside a normal caloric intake of 8500–10,500 kJ/d)
(29), or differing intake of carbohydrates, protein, and PUFAs,
and/or without strict control of food profiles and quality.
In the present study (NCT01750021), we randomly assigned
abdominally obese men to diets dominated by either fat or car-
bohydrate to evaluate possible differential effects on visceral fat
mass and body composition (primary outcome measures), and
biochemical and clinical variables, including components of
metabolic syndrome (secondary outcome measures). The low-fat,
high-carbohydrate (LFHC) and very high–fat, low-carbohydrate
(VHFLC) diets were planned to be isocaloric and modestly
energy-restrictive with an equal intake (percentage of total energy
intake) of protein and PUFAs. To reduce bias from different food
profiles, the experimental menus were based on the same food
items in both diet groups.
METHODS
Participants and study design
The study was conducted according to the guidelines in the
Declaration of Helsinki. All experimental procedures were ap-
proved by the Regional Ethics Committee (comparison of 2
weight-reducing diets in overweight men, 2011/2282/REK west).
The study design, sample collection, and potential risks and
benefits were carefully explained to each participant before they
provided written informed consent.
We recruited 56 male subjects with abdominal obesity, normal
fasting blood glucose ,7 mmol/L, waist circumference (WC)
.98 cm, and BMI (in kg/m2) .29 or percentage of body fat
$25 through a project description in a local newspaper. Ex-
clusion criteria were severe diseases, including inflammatory
bowel diseases, known food allergies, regular medication (ex-
cept for alkalizing gastric buffers), attempts at systematic weight
reduction over the previous 6 mo, and/or regularly consuming
.2 alcohol units/wk. To further promote a homogeneous group,
only men between 30 and 50 y of age were included.
The trial was performed in Bergen, Norway. From August
2012 to the intervention startup in January 2013, 2 prescreenings
were performed to ensure that all participants met the inclusion
criteria at the time of intervention. Six men did not meet the
inclusion criteria, and 4 withdrew before random assignment,
leaving 46 participants who were randomly assigned to a VHFLC
or LFHC diet (parallel design). Random assignment was performed
after the second prescreening w8 wk before baseline. The list of
prescreening appointments was used to randomly assign the par-
ticipants by drawing ballots and blocking with block sizes of 2.
Two additional men were lost before baseline assessment (1 in the
LFHC group did not show up, and 1 in the VHFLC group
withdrew for personal reasons), leaving a total of 44 men who
started dieting. All participants were informed of group allocation
after the baseline measurements and sampling. The nature of the
trial required an open intervention with no blinding of the trial
participants or the investigators.
The sample size was considered to be sufficient when assessed
by the power in similar previous studies (16); the strong ho-
mogeneity with respect to age, sex, and abdominal adiposity; and
the planned large difference in fat and carbohydrate intake. Post
hoc power analysis for the primary outcome [(difference in
change of visceral fat mass measured by computed tomography
(CT)] indicated w40% power for the per protocol analysis, and
we could not rule out type II errors.
The body weight of all participants was stable (,5% change)
before the intervention, and they were asked to refrain from
changing their physical activity level during the intervention. To
promote compliance, the participants were questioned about their
ability to strictly follow a diet, and the importance of honesty and
accuracy was emphasized during consultations.
To limit differences in individual micronutrient status that might
influence energy metabolism, the participants were instructed to
take a broad-spectrum vitamin and mineral supplement [Solaray
Spektro without iron, provided by Au Naturel (UK)] for 8 wk before
the start of the intervention.
Study visits
The study was carried out from January to May 2013. Each
period of study visits (baseline and 4, 8, and 12 wk) was com-
pleted within w3 wk. Four participants from the same diet group
attended at any 1 d during the period of baseline visits, and the
same participant order was used at follow-up visits. The partici-
pants arrived after fasting overnight or for $10 h, during which a
small amount of water was permitted. An w15 min conversation
with a nutritionist in the presence of a physician took place at all
visits. Measurements were performed in the following order:
bioelectrical impedance analysis, indirect calorimetry, blood
samples, and CT scan. To maximize retention and compliance to
the diets, participants were followed up closely with regular
contact between visits, and they were offered individual coun-
seling as needed throughout the study.

 Study diets
The planned macronutrient profile for the LFHC group was 53%
of energy (275 g/d) carbohydrate, 17% of energy (90 g) protein,
and 30% of energy (70 g) fat, in accordance with typical current
Western dietary guidelines. The planned macronutrient profile for
the VHFLC group was 10% of energy (50 g) carbohydrate, 17% of
energy (90 g) protein, and 73% of energy (170 g) fat. Because our
purpose was to compare responses to well-defined diets sharply
contrasting in carbohydrate and fat within a normal caloric range,
and not explicitly examining effects of energy restriction, all
participants were asked to consume a total of 8750 kJ/d from
carbohydrate, fat, and protein.
All men in both groups were instructed to avoid hydrogenated
vegetable fat, sugar, and foods with added sugar, and to restrict
the intake of highly processed foods and plant oils with high
amounts of v-6 fatty acids. Both groups were told to consume
$500 g vegetables, berries, and fruits (emphasizing vegetables
relative to fruits)/d, and to eat vegetables with every meal. Two
fish dinners per week were recommended. To meet the energy
requirement from carbohydrate on the LFHC diet, while avoiding
excessive portion sizes of vegetables and rice, we chose to include
juice as a regular carbohydrate source in this diet. To help par-
ticipants choose standardized ingredients, they were provided
with some products donated by food suppliers, including butter
(Tine); coconut fat (Cocosa; Soma Nordic); erythritol and stevia
as sugar substitutes (Sukrin+; Funksjonell Mat); and a special mix
of, among other ingredients, almond flour and plant fibers to
make low-carbohydrate breads and cakes (Funksjonell Mat).
To facilitate compliance and dietary recording during inter-
vention, a comprehensive recipe booklet was customized for each
diet group with precalculated nutrient content and clear instruc-
tions for meal and snack preparation. The recipe for each meal or
snack was designed to comply with the daily intake of macro-
nutrients (both in grams and percentage of energy) as well as the
recommended food profile, emphasizing homemade meals and
low-processed foods without added sugar. The booklet included
537 recipes (.225 for each diet and some common) that par-
ticipants could choose from, in turn comprising 1092 ingredients
or products. The booklet was developed with the software
FileMaker Pro 12 Advanced, and was made available as an
electronic application for iPhone and iPad, as well as in pdf
format. Importantly, we obtained complete information on the
content of total carbohydrate, fat, and protein for all predefined
meals. Of the ingredients and products, 99 had missing data for
dietary fiber, 228 for added sugar, 75 for fatty acid subtypes
(saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated), and 175 for
cholesterol. The food selections were carefully designed to
minimize differences in food types consumed within and be-
tween groups. Before baseline, the participants completed a
half-day course at which they received detailed instructions on
how to implement the recipe booklet system.
Diet recording
Before starting the diet in January/February 2013, the par-
ticipants completed baseline diet records for 5 consecutive days
(including weekends). During the intervention, diet recording
was carried out over 5 successive days (including weekends) each
month, for a total of 15 d (17% of the entire intervention). The
participants were asked to weigh and record the amount of all
ingredients and products that were eaten at every meal (breakfast,
lunch, dinner, supper, and snacks), together with the time of the
meal. They submitted the consumed ingredients in an online
dietary recording system (www.diett.no; operated by Dietika)
linked to data on nutritional content derived from the official
Norwegian Food Composition Table (www.matvaretabellen.no)
and declaration by producers. When Norwegian data were not
available, values from international databases (Danish, Finnish,
or US food composition tables) were used. The recording system
at www.diett.no directly calculated energy intake and amount of
macronutrients and some micronutrients. The participants also
provided additional comments on their food intake on this sys-
tem, as well as records of physical activity, i.e., the frequency,
duration, and intensity of different sport and daily life activities,
which was converted to kilocalories per hour on the basis of
estimated energy expenditure for the recorded activities (30). The
data were transferred to a separate database (created by FileMaker
Pro 12 Advanced) for further data processing.
During the intervention, the participants used www.diett.no to
simply report the identifications of our recipes and dishes when
following the predefined menus in the recipe booklet. Deviations
from the menus were recorded in a template below the dish
identification. When participants were traveling or dining out,
they reported the amount of ingredients as standardized house-
hold measures and recorded them manually as for baseline re-
cords. To reduce biased diet recording, the participants were told
that the selection of foods and recipes during these periods should
reflect the actual food intake and the degree of deviation from the
diet throughout the whole month. The online system also allowed
interaction with participants during dietary recordings to help
rectify missed recordings and obvious mistakes.
Blood samples
Venous blood (whole blood, plasma, and serum) was collected
from fasting subjects between 0800 and 1130 and stored at
2808C after preparation. All analyses were performed at the
Laboratory of Clinical Biochemistry and the Hormone Labora-
tory at Haukeland University Hospital according to standardized
procedures, with the exception of serum nonesterified fatty acids
(NEFAs), which were analyzed with the use of a NEFA FS kit
from DiaSys (Diagnostics Systems) on a Cobas c111 Chemistry
Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). All samples from each single
participant were measured simultaneously.
The homeostasis model assessment is reported as a surrogate
measure of insulin sensitivity, with the use of the homeostasis
model assessment calculator developed by the University of
Oxford (http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/index.php) to
estimate insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) and sensitivity (homeo-
stasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity index 2) on the basis
of the updated computerized model (31, 32). We used glucose and
insulin C-peptide (INCP) data for this.
Respiratory gas analyses
Respiratory gases were measured by an ergospirometer with a
breath-to-breath analyzer (Schiller Cardiovit CS-200 Ergo-
Spiro/13 Ganzhorn Power Cube; Schiller) (indirect calorimetry).
The participants were told to avoid physical exertion and activity

 for 2 d before the analysis to prevent interference by lactic acid
and oxygen liabilities. Participants were placed in a prone po-
sition and rested for w30 min during ventilation gas exchange
measurement (20 min) to determine resting energy expenditure.
The gas exchange from nutrient substrate catabolized for energy
was assessed with the use of a respiratory exchange ratio (RER),
i.e., the ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed.
The RER for carbohydrate (glucose) oxidation produces an equal
number of carbon dioxide molecules to oxygen molecules con-
sumed, i.e., RER = 1. The RER for lipids range between 0.69 and
0.73, depending on the oxidized fatty acid carbon chain length
(33). A Weir equation was used according to the exchange of
gases to quantify the RER (34), and we used this quotient to
verify dietary compliance.
Blood pressure was measured by a BP-200 plus oscillometric
monitor (Schiller) during indirect calorimetry when the men
were in a resting prone position (mean of 3 measurements).
Body composition
Body weight and composition were measured by a segmental
multifrequency bioelectrical impedance measurement system
(InBody 720; BioSpace). The participants were measured while
barefoot and wearing light clothing, and were asked to use the
restroom shortly before and to stand in an upright position for
$5 min before measurement.
CT scan
Noncontrasted CT scans were performed to assess fat lipid
accumulation in the abdominal area, i.e., visceral adipose tissue
(VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and liver. CT allows
precise assessment of liver density measured in Hounsfield units
(HUs), calculated as liver attenuation:spleen attenuation HU
index and liver-spleen HU difference, which correlate strongly
with liver triglycerides and liver macrosteatosis (35).
Volumetric adipose tissue imaging was performed on partic-
ipants while they were lying in a supine position with the use of a
256-slice multidetector CT scanner (SOMATOM Definition
Flash; Siemens). Participants had a mean of 70 contiguous 5-mm-
thick cross-sectional abdominal images (120 peak kilovoltage;
180 milliampere; gantry rotation time, 500 ms). The cross-
sectional abdominal images covered 350 mm from the level of
L5/S1 to the upper right diaphragm. The mean radiation dose was
8.0 milligray.
A previously established method was used for measurement of
the abdominal adipose tissue (36). SAT and VAT, as well as WC,
were measured with an offline workstation (Aquarius iNtuition
Edition version 4.4.7.85.5213; TeraRecon). WC (centimeters)
was measured with the use of a single slice (5-mm thickness) at
the umbilical level. HU values of pixels in CT correspond directly
to the tissue property. A predefined image display setting with an
image display window width of 2195 to 245 HU was applied to
identify pixels containing adipose tissue (37). To separate VAT
from SAT, the abdominal muscular wall separating the 2 com-
partments was manually traced. SAT and VAT were measured
across the total imaging volume and were calculated in cubic
centimeters. The mean time for image analysis was 10 min/subject.
Regrettably, data from 2 participants were lost during temporary
storage and inadequate data transfer.
Statistics
We reported the results from a per protocol (PP) analysis for 38
participants who completed the study (Tables 1–5, Figures 1–4,
Supplemental Tables 1–5) of the 46 who were initially en-
rolled. We also performed an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis
that included all randomly assigned participants except 2 cases
that were lost before baseline (44 eligible participants in total).
These 2 were unaware of the group allocation and did not provide
any dietary or clinical data. Because the trial’s objective was
explanatory and we sought to determine the efficacy of the 2 diets,
not primarily the effectiveness, we chose to report the PP analysis
in the main manuscript (Tables 1–5, Figures 1–4), and to present
the ITT analysis for our primary outcomes in Supplemental
Tables 6 and 7. Notably, the results from the PP and ITT analyses
did not differ in nominal significance for any of the primary or
secondary outcomes.
Our missing data analysis (data not shown), including Little’s
missing completely at random test, indicated that the dropouts
were missing (completely) at random, and we found no signif-
icant differences between dropouts and completers in baseline
characteristics, except for significant higher diastolic blood
pressure, total cholesterol (TC), and LDL cholesterol in com-
pleters. In the reported PP and ITT analyses, we used mixed
models without imputation to handle missing data. However, we
also conducted an ITT analysis based on a full dataset in which
missing values in the original data were replaced by values from
multiple imputation (data not shown). Differences in nominal
significance between these ITT analyses are indicated in the
footnotes of Supplemental Tables 6 and 7.
We tested for outliers and influential cases with the use of
standardized and Studentized residuals (z score .3.29), boxplots,
residual plots, and Cook’s distance [D . 4/(n 2 k 21)]. The
assumption of normality, assessed by graphic tools and the
Shapiro-Wilk test, was violated for some dietary and clinical
variables. Therefore, both parametric and nonparametric signifi-
cance tests, including robust methods with trimmed means,
M-estimation, and/or bootstrapping, were conducted and com-
pared, but no differences in nominal significance between
methods were found. Here, we chose to report results from the
parametric tests.
Group differences in score changes between different time
points were analyzed by linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs)
with the use of best-fitted variance and random structures, and
diet, time, and diet 3 time as fixed effects factors with the
categorical time variable defined by appropriate contrasts
(Supplemental Table 8). In some analyses, means or score changes
were compared between groups with the use of independent-
samples t tests with Welch correction for unequal variances. If
no significant group difference was found, we tested the score
change from baseline to 12 wk for the combined groups (i.e., pooled
data for all participants).
When testing for group differences in primary and secondary
outcomes, the models were adjusted for age and covariates with
potentially clinically important differences at baseline, i.e., intake
of energy, carbohydrate, added sugar, and cholesterol (Table 1).
The adjusted and unadjusted results did not differ in nominal
significance, except for short-term responses between interme-
diate time points for some biochemical variables (Table 5). In
separate analyses not shown, we also tested several other covariate

 scenarios, including a model adjusted for age and important
factors that we intended to control for in our design, and that
consequently should not vary between groups at baseline and
during the intervention, i.e., activity level and intake of energy,
protein, PUFAs, and alcohol. None of these adjusted models
changed the nominal significance compared with the unadjusted
models for variables reported in Tables 2–4 and Supplemental
Tables 4–7.
Bivariate and partial correlation analyses with 95% bootstrapped
(bias corrected and accelerated) CIs (95% BCa CIs) were used to
determine associations between variables. Here, Pearson’s r, 95%
BCa CI, and P values are reported.
All data are presented as raw unadjusted means 6 SDs or score
changes (95% CIs) if not otherwise specified. P values , 0.05
were considered to be statistically significant when the 95% CI
did not cross zero, and all P values are from 2-tailed analyses.
The statistical analyses were performed with R, version 3.3.0
(https://www.R-project.org), and the LMEM analyses were
conducted with the nlme package, version 3.1-128 (https://
CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlme).

1 Values are raw unadjusted means 6 SDs or mean score changes (95% CIs) and are based on values from all participants who provided diet records at
baseline and from $1 time point (after 4, 8, and/or 12 wk) during the diet intervention. Values for the intervention period are the means of outcomes from
dietary recordings after 4, 8 and 12 wk. CIs and P values are from 2-tailed analysis with the use of linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) with best-fitted
variance and random structures. Two participants in the LFHC group did not record their food intake. ***Significantly different, P # 0.001. LFHC, low-fat,
high-carbohydrate; no, no specific recommendation; VHFLC, very high–fat, low-carbohydrate.
2 Energy intake and macronutrient profile for the planned diets. Specified kilojoules include the energy content of the planned amounts of the
macronutrients carbohydrate, protein, and fat, and not fiber, for which there were no specific recommendations, or alcohol, for which the recommendation
was no alcohol. Therefore, the actual energy content in the planned diets would be slightly higher.
3 Asterisks designate a significantly different intake between groups during the intervention.
4 Absolute mean score change from baseline to intervention, and 95% CI from an LMEM.
5 Group difference in absolute score change from baseline to intervention, and 95% CI from a linear mixed-effects model. 2: Greater reduction (or less
increase) in the VHFLC group than in the LFHC group. +: Less reduction (or greater increase) in the VHFLC group. Asterisks designate a significant group
difference.
6 Relative percentage change from baseline to intervention calculated from the ln ratio. Log ratio = ln (follow-up value/baseline value). % = (emean log ratio 2 1) 3 100.
7 Extreme values for 3 participants in the LFHC group were excluded. These extreme values were due to very high alcohol intake at a single event during
the entire intervention period.

 RESULTS
Of the 46 randomly assigned participants, 2 withdrew before
baseline visits, and 4 dropped out early during follow-up,
leaving a total of 40 men who completed the intervention.
Furthermore, data from 2 men in the VHFLC group were ex-
cluded from the analysis because of noncompliance based on diet
records and data collected at study visits. The final numbers of
analyzed participants were therefore 18 in the LFHC group (aged
40.2 6 4.50 y) and 20 in the VHFLC group (aged 40.3 6 5.53)
(Figure 1A, Supplemental Figure 1). The results presented here
originate from the PP analysis, which included these 38 par-
ticipants, whereas data from the ITT analysis of all randomly
assigned subjects (except the 2 lost before baseline) are not
reported in this section because these results did not differ from
the PP analysis in nominal significance.
Dietary intake and food profile
Detailed 5-d dietary records showed no differences at baseline
in the intake of energy and macronutrients (Figure 1B, Table 1,
Supplemental Table 1). As planned during the intervention, total
energy and protein intake were equal in the 2 diet groups. The
percentage of energy from fat and carbohydrate for the LFHC
diet was 29% and 51%, respectively, and for the VHFLC diet, it
was 71% and 11%, respectively (Figure 1B, Supplemental
Table 1). The estimated contribution of SFAs to total energy
intake was 12% of energy and 34% of energy for the LFHC and
VHFLC diets, respectively (Supplemental Table 1). The dietary
records also estimated an overall modest reduction in total
energy intake for both diets (22% and 14% reduction for LFHC
and VHFLC diets, respectively), but with notable interindividual
variation (Figure 1B, Table 1).

1 Values are raw unadjusted means 6 SDs or mean score changes (95% CIs). Body composition was measured with a segmental multifre-
quency bioelectrical impedance measurement system (InBody 720). CIs and P values are from 2-tailed analysis with the use of LMEMs with best-
fitted variance and random structures, and diet, time, and diet 3 time as fixed-effects factors. **,***Significantly different: **P , 0.01, ***P # 0.001. BP,
blood pressure; LFHC, low-fat, high-carbohydrate; LMEM, linear mixed-effects model; VHFLC, very high–fat, low-carbohydrate.
2 LMEMs with time as a fixed effects factor coded by appropriate contrasts showed that the anthropometric variables changed significantly (P , 0.001)
between different time points (from baseline to 4 wk, from 4 to 8 wk, and from 8 to 12 wk) within groups and for the combined groups (pooled data), except
for fat-free mass and skeletal muscle mass (data not shown). Group differences in absolute score changes between intermediate time points were not
significant for any of these variables.
3 No significant difference between groups was found for any variable at 12 wk (data not shown).
4 Absolute mean score change from baseline to 12 wk for pooled data, and 95% CI from an LMEM. Because there was no significant difference between
the changes in the diet groups for any of the variables, we tested the changes from baseline to 12 wk for the combined groups. Within-group changes are shown
in Supplemental Table 4.
5 P value for change from baseline to 12 wk between groups (time 3 group interaction) from an LMEM adjusted for age and baseline intake of energy,

and were not significantly different from the intention-to-treat analysis (Supplemental Table 6).

 Compared with baseline, the absolute intake in grams of total fat,
SFAs, and MUFAs increased in the VHFLC group by 63%, 97%,
and 68%, respectively, whereas total and saturated fat were reduced
by 34–36% with the LFHC diet (Table 1). The absolute intake of
PUFAs was reduced by 30% and 18% in the LFHC and VHFLC
groups, respectively. Importantly, there was no significant group
difference in total PUFA intake during the diet intervention, and
the percentage of energy of PUFAs at baseline remained un-
changed for both interventions (Supplemental Table 1). The per-
centage of energy from protein remained unchanged from baseline
on the 2 diets (after a 20% and 16% reduction in absolute
intake in the LFHC and VHFLC groups, respectively), and did
not differ between groups during the intervention (Table 1,
Supplemental Table 1). Although the percentage of energy
from carbohydrates increased on the LFHC diet in replacement
of fat, the absolute intake of carbohydrate did not. Notably,
the intake of added sugar was reduced in both groups by al-
most 100%, whereas the absolute intake of fiber increased
in the LFHC group and decreased in the VHFLC group. How-
ever, the percentage of energy from fiber did not change
significantly in the VHFLC group. Finally, cholesterol in-
take increased by 25% with the LFHC diet and more than
doubled with the VHFLC diet compared with baseline
(Table 1).
In line with the planned standardization of food profile, partic-
ipants assigned to both diets consumed the same primary sources of
fats, carbohydrates, and proteins (Supplemental Table 2). Of note,
the LFHC group consumed almost twice the volume of food that the
VHFLC group consumed (2126 compared with 1234 g/d), primarily
because of a higher intake of vegetables, breads, rice, and juices
(Supplemental Table 2). The most frequently chosen menus from the
2 diets are shown in Supplemental Table 3.
As an additional test of dietary adherence, we measured
the RER based on indirect calorimetry, in which a decreased RER
reflects enhanced oxidation of fatty acids relative to carbohydrate.
Although the dietary records showed a marked difference in fat
intake between groups, which is expected to differentially affect
fat oxidation, we found no significant difference in RER between
groups at follow-up (95% CI: 20.07, 0.01; P = 0.505) or in
absolute score change from baseline (95% CI: 20.10, 0.01;
P = 0.187) (Figure 2).
Physical activity level
The recorded levels of physical activity, expressed as kcal/h and
based on the monthly recordings at www.diett.no, did not change
from baseline to intervention (LFHC group—95% CI: 213.8, 57.1;
P = 0.203; VHFLC group—95% CI: 25.38, 18.9; P = 0.285), and

P = 0.753), and in absolute score change from baseline (95%
CI: 252.4, 22.6; P = 0.401 (data not shown).
Body composition and clinical variables
Total body weight decreased similarly on both diets, resulting
in a 3.6–3.7 reduction in BMI points (Table 2, Figure 3A). Only 2
participants in each group lost ,5% of their initial weight, and
about one-half of them, i.e., 9 and 11 participants in the LFHC
and VHFLC groups, respectively, lost $10%. Body composition
variables were also assessed every 4 wk by bioimpedance. Be-
cause fat-free mass and skeletal muscle mass only decreased by
2–3% from baseline, the body weight reduction on both diets could
largely be ascribed to a 26–30% decrease in body fat mass, related
to a 9–11% decrease in WC and a 28–30% reduction in visceral fat
area (Table 2, Supplemental Table 4). The participants also showed
a highly significant reduction in blood pressure (Table 2).

 We further quantified depot-specific changes in fat mass by CT
imaging. The volume of total abdominal fat decreased on average
by 21–26% with the respective diets, with no significant group
differences in absolute or relative score changes from baseline
to 12 wk (Table 3, Supplemental Table 4). Visceral fat and sub-
cutaneous fat volume decreased on average by 21–27% and
21–25%, respectively (Figure 3B, Table 3, Supplemental Table 4).
There were no significant group differences in absolute or relative
score changes from baseline in the visceral-to-total abdominal fat
volume ratio (Table 3, Supplemental Table 4). Finally, hepatic
volume decreased equally with both diets (Figure 3C), as did
pericardial fat volume (Table 3, Supplemental Table 4). The ITT
analysis showed the same results as the PP analysis in terms of
nominal significance for all anthropometric variables (Supple-
mental Tables 6, 7).
To assess whether the diet-induced decreases in visceral fat might
have been due to reduced energy intake, we correlated the relative
change in total energy intake with the relative change in visceral fat
volume. There were no significant correlations, either for the groups
separately (Figure 3D) or for all participants combined (r = 0.14,
95% BCa CI: 20.29, 0.48; P = 0.433). This lack of correlation
with energy intake was also observed for subcutaneous fat volume
(r = 0.11, 95% BCa CI: 20.27, 0.50; P = 0.538), hepatic lipid
content (liver-spleen ratio: r = 20.22, 95% BCa CI: 20.47, 0.09;
P = 0.221) and pericardial fat volume (r = 0.08, 95% BCa CI: 20.36,
0.45; P = 0.658). Several of the participants recorded an almost
unchanged or even an increased total energy intake compared
with baseline, and still showed substantial reductions in body
weight (data not shown), visceral fat volume (Figure 3D), and hepatic
volume (data not shown). Of note, those with the highest hepatic
lipid content at baseline experienced the largest reduction in
hepatic fat on either diet, based on correlating liver-spleen ratio
at baseline with the relative change during intervention (r = 20.86,
95% BCa CI: 20.92, 20.66; P , 0.001).

 reduction only in the LFHC group (Table 4, Figure 4A). Circu-
lating concentrations of insulin, INCP, glycated hemoglobin,
glucagon, and triglycerides, together with HOMA2-IR and ho-
meostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity index 2, were
significantly reduced from baseline to 12 wk with both diets, with
no significant group differences in change across time (Table 4,
Figure 4B and C). Both diets also similarly affected circulating
concentrations of NEFAs, with an initial significant increase from
baseline to 4 wk, and a return to baseline concentrations after
significant reductions between 8 and 12 wk (Table 4, Figure 4D).
Significant group differences were found in change from
baseline to 12 wk for TC, LDL cholesterol (decreased in
the LFHC group only), and HDL cholesterol (increased in the
VHFLC group only) (Table 4, Figure 4E and F), but not for the
TC-to–HDL cholesterol or triglyceride-to–HDL cholesterol ra-
tios in the adjusted LMEMs when controlling for potentially
clinically important differences at baseline in dietary intake,
i.e., energy, carbohydrate, added sugar, and cholesterol (Table 1).
These results did not differ in nominal significance from the un-
adjusted models, except for the triglyceride-to–HDL cholesterol
ratio (95% CI: 20.71, 20.03; P = 0.032) because of a higher re-
duction in the VHFLC group.
In line with reduced liver fat, both groups showed significant re-
ductions from baseline in circulating concentrations of alanine ami-
notransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, g-glutamyltranspeptidase
and lactate dehydrogenase, with no group differences in score
changes from baseline for any of these or other measured
variables related to liver function (Supplemental Table 5). No
changes from baseline were observed for circulating albu-
min, bile acids, or creatine kinase, whereas alkaline phosphatase
and bilirubin decreased significantly (groups combined) (Sup-
plemental Table 5).
In summary, for all of the primary outcomes (i.e., anthropometric
measures) and biochemical variables except glucose and cholesterol
(TC, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol), we found no signif-
icant group differences in the overall score changes from baseline to
12 wk (time 3 diet interaction) (Tables 2–4, Supplemental Table 5).
Interestingly, although the anthropometric measurements typi-
cally showed a gradual decrease over time (Table 2), with no
significant group differences for any of the 4-wk intervals (data not
shown), many of the biochemical variables showed nonlinear
changes throughout the intervention (Table 4). The groups showed
significantly different short-term changes in TC and LDL cho-
lesterol during the first half of the intervention (0–4 and 0–8 wk), in

measured by CT imaging and analyzed by a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for age and baseline intake of energy, carbohydrate, added sugar, and cholesterol
(see main text) (C). The degree of change in total energy intake from baseline to 12 wk did not correlate with the percentage change in visceral fat volume measured
by CT imaging (D). LFHC n = 18, VHFLC n = 18 (B–D). Means 6 SDs with error bars are shown for the different time points (A–C). Within-group score changes

 glucose and insulin and INCP during the middle (0–8 and
4–8 wk), and in HDL cholesterol during the last part (8–12 wk)
(Tables 4 and 5). TC and LDL cholesterol showed an early de-
crease with the LFHC diet and an early increase with the VHFLC
diet, whereas HDL cholesterol increased only with the VHFLC
diet between 8 and 12 wk (Figure 4E and F, Tables 4 and 5). In
contrast, the changes in triglyceride and NEFA concentrations
were similar for the 2 groups across all time points (Figure 4C and
D, Table 5). Interestingly, the TC-to–HDL cholesterol and tri-
glyceride-to–HDL cholesterol ratios significantly improved only in
the VHFLC group between 8 and 12 wk (Table 5) owing to si-
multaneous reductions in TC and triglycerides and an increase in
HDL cholesterol in this group (Table 4). Moreover, glucose and
insulin concentrations and HOMA2-IR, increased between 4
and 8 wk, followed by reductions between 8 and 12 wk (Figure
4E and F, Tables 4 and 5). Of note, all biochemical variables
improved from 8 to 12 wk in the VHFLC group after increasing
in $1 of the preceding intervals (Tables 4 and 5). Except for
NEFAs (Figure 4D), this biochemical pattern was not found for
any variable in the LFHC group (Tables 4 and 5). It should be

 noted, however, that the responses of several biochemical markers
varied between participants in both groups (Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
In the present dietary intervention study, we found a marked
reduction in visceral fat mass and improvements in most of the
measured clinical variables related to metabolic function, inde-
pendent of a sharp dichotomy in the fat-to-carbohydrate intake
ratio. Our results are in line with systematic reviews and meta-
analyses of epidemiologic and dietary intervention studies, which
overall do not support a causal connection between SFA intake
per se and risk of metabolic syndrome, fatty liver, or CVD, re-
gardless of the effects on LDL cholesterol (16, 21, 24, 28, 38–42).
Our study has some important characteristics. First, the top 10
energy-contributing foods were the same for both groups, varying
mainly in quantity. As in animal diet studies, we believe this
principle of controlling for food types should be standard in any
comparison of diets. Second, we obtained complete information on
the macronutrient content of every meal and food item the par-
ticipants recorded during the intervention, which, along with our
Internet-based meal planning system, helped to decrease uncertainty
in the nutrient intake estimates. Moreover, a special feature of our
randomized controlled study was the very high intake of total and
saturated fat while controlling for intake of energy, protein, and
PUFAs, as well as food types. Results of previous studies that
replaced PUFAs with SFAs or vice versa (24, 43) partly might be
ascribed to changes in PUFA intake. Controlled studies have shown
that PUFAs modulate metabolic function, inflammatory response,
and risk of CVD (44). Finally, the recorded daily energy intake at
baseline and during the intervention period in the present study was
substantially higher than in most similar dietary intervention trials
(mostly 6500–7500 kJ/d for men) (45, 46).
Importantly, there was no significant correlation between
relative change in energy intake and relative changes in subcu-
taneous, visceral, hepatic, or pericardial fat, and the overall re-
ductions in body fat were greater in our trial than were those in
previous studies with more energy-restricted diets (45, 47). Of
note, the energy content of our high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet
was likely higher than would have been the case with ad libitum
consumption of such a diet (16, 45, 48), and it still resulted in
marked metabolic improvements. Also, energy restriction cannot
explain the nonlinear changes we observed in biochemical variables
across the different 4-wk intervals, highlighting the involvement of
macronutrient-dependent adaptive metabolic mechanisms beyond
a static effect of energy intake. Importantly, loss of fat-free and
skeletal muscle mass with both the VHFLC and LFHC diets was
negligible (on average ,1.5% of body weight at baseline). These
results indicate that improving dietary pattern and food quality
within a normal caloric intake of 8500–10500 kJ/d can lead to a
substantial reduction in fat mass while avoiding excess loss of
muscle mass, regardless of total and saturated fat intake.
Our results do not support the main finding in a recent metabolic
ward study showing that a very low–fat diet (71% of energy
carbohydrate and 8% of energy fat) promotes greater body fat loss
after 6 d than an isoenergetic (1918 kcal) and isoproteinic (21%
of energy protein) reduced-carbohydrate diet (29% of energy
carbohydrate and 50% of energy fat) (49). The authors calculated
that the mean 6-d cumulative fat loss differed between the groups
by 218 g (i.e., 36 g/d), which would correspond to an w3 kg
difference in body fat over the 12-wk duration of our study. How-
ever, we found no significant group differences in fat loss. The
discrepancy may be related to, e.g., the degree of fat and energy
restriction and different food profiles, as well as the uncertainty of
linear predictions in estimating long-term responses.
An important aspect of our study was the repeated measure-
ments after 4, 8, and 12 wk of intervention, providing insight into
distinct short-term dynamics of adaptation to diets high in car-
bohydrate or fat. Previous observations have suggested that $3–6 wk
of metabolic adaptation (keto-adaptation) may be needed when
switching from carbohydrate to fat as the primary energy source
(50, 51). In line with our results, studies of high-fat, low-carbohydrate
diets that are ,2 mo in duration therefore are likely to be misleading
with respect to the actual health effects. Moreover, a study beyond
3 mo is needed to determine whether the high-fat, low-carbohydrate
diet would be more beneficial for body composition than would the
high-carbohydrate diet in the longer term. Ideally, future studies
should be performed with a feeding component for better control of
food intake.
The diet-specific temporal pattern we observed for glucose and
insulin responses may reflect group-specific differences in post-
prandial and diurnal concentrations of NEFA, i.e., the NEFA fluxes,
which we did not measure. It was shown previously that fasting
concentrations of NEFA were not different between groups con-
suming a high-carbohydrate or a high-fat diet, whereas postprandial
and diurnal NEFA concentrations were significantly higher in the
high-fat diet group (52). NEFA fluxes may determine glucose and
insulin concentrations, as well as insulin sensitivity (53–55).
A characteristic of our study is that the 2 groups consumed
differing amounts of the same food types, unlike in many other
studies, in which groups also differed with respect to the foods
consumed. The similar food profiles in our study might explain at
least some of the group similarity in metabolic benefits (e.g., by
minimizing processed foods, improving micronutrient status,
microbiota, or other factors), consistent with previous reports
on effects of food profile beyond energy restriction (15, 56).
For example, replacing processed foods with whole foods
(e.g., replacing high-glycemic foods with lower-glycemic foods)
can reduce the risk of coronary artery disease (57), promote
weight loss and enhanced body composition (15), and improve
key metabolic functions, such as insulin sensitivity (10, 58).
The marked improvements in most risk-related variables with
both diets, on the one hand, and a lack of reduction in LDL
cholesterol with the VHFLC diet on the other, raises the question
of whether an isolated risk assessment based on LDL cholesterol
alone is justified. Increased visceral fat remains a strong, in-
dependent risk factor for insulin resistance, T2D, and CVD, also
after adjusting for circulating cholesterol concentrations (59, 60).
In line with these data and the present results, there is compelling
evidence against an important contribution of total and saturated
fat intake per se to visceral and ectopic fat accumulation and risk of
CVD (22, 24, 28, 42). Moreover, the dyslipidemia that is typical with
obesity is characterized by increased concentration of triglycerides
and low HDL cholesterol (61), the ratio of which is an independent
CVD risk marker (62), and which clearly improved with the VHFLC
diet. It should also be noted that the CVD risk associated with LDL
cholesterol has a considerable genetic component (63). Finally,
contrary to previous reports that a high intake of SFAs may increase
LDL cholesterol (22, 23), and consistent with a feeding study

 observed no significant increase in LDL cholesterol with the VHFLC
diet, which on average doubled SFA intake from baseline.
Limitations of the present study include a relatively low
number of participants, no control group consuming their regular
diet, an increased risk of false positives with a large number of
statistical tests, and an open-label design that may have intro-
duced some bias. Although great effort was made to obtain
representative dietary records, uncertainty is expected, especially
for the baseline estimates to which the interventions were
compared. A larger number of participants might have revealed
additional significant differences between the groups. The ex-
clusion of 4 of the randomly assigned participants in our main
analysis may have introduced some bias, whereas including these
4 in the ITTanalysis increased the number of outliers, particularly
in the VHFLC group. Nonetheless, the ITT and PP analyses
showed similar and significant improvements from baseline to
12 wk for the trial’s primary outcomes (visceral fat mass and body
composition) and the secondary outcomes (e.g., biochemical
variables). Furthermore, the present study was designed to compare
short-term dynamics in response to the VHFLC and LFHC diets,
and possible longer-term differential responses were not addressed.
Finally, we studied a relatively homogenous group of middle-aged
men without diabetes, which may have decreased interindividual
variability, but may also limit the generalizability. For example,
VHFLC diets may have better effect in more insulin-resistant
individuals (65).
In summary, we found similar responses to highly standardized
LFHC and VHFLC diets with respect to intra-abdominal fat mass,
hepatic lipid content, pericardial fat volume, and components of
metabolic syndrome. Our study cautions against extrapolating
short-term (1–2 mo) metabolic responses to longer-term effects of
macronutrients on cardiometabolic risk.
