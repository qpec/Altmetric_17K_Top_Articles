IMPORTANCE State-specific information about the health burden of smoking is valuable
because state-level initiatives are at the forefront of tobacco control. Smoking-attributable
cancer mortality estimates are currently available nationally and by cancer, but not by state.
OBJECTIVE To calculate the proportion of cancer deaths among adults 35 years and older that
were attributable to cigarette smoking in 2014 in each state and the District of Columbia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The population-attributable fraction (PAF) of cancer
deaths due to cigarette smoking was computed using relative risks for 12 smoking-related
cancers (acute myeloid leukemia and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx; esophagus;
stomach; colorectum; liver; pancreas; larynx; trachea, lung, and bronchus; cervix uteri; kidney
and renal pelvis; and urinary bladder) from large US prospective studies and state-specific
smoking prevalence data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The PAF of cancer deaths due to cigarette smoking in each
US state and the District of Columbia.
RESULTS We estimate that at least 167 133 cancer deaths in the United States in 2014 (28.6%
of all cancer deaths; 95% CI, 28.2%-28.8%) were attributable to cigarette smoking. Among
men, the proportion of cancer deaths attributable to smoking ranged from a low of 21.8% in
Utah (95% CI, 19.9%-23.5%) to a high of 39.5% in Arkansas (95% CI, 36.9%-41.7%), but was
at least 30% in every state except Utah. Among women, the proportion ranged from 11.1% in
Utah (95% CI, 9.6%-12.3%) to 29.0% in Kentucky (95% CI, 27.2%-30.7%) and was at least
20% in all states except Utah, California, and Hawaii. Nine of the top 10 ranked states for men
and 6 of the top 10 ranked states for women were located in the South. In men, smoking
explained nearly 40% of cancer deaths in the top 5 ranked states (Arkansas, Louisiana,
Tennessee, West Virginia, and Kentucky). In women, smoking explained more than 26% of all
cancer deaths in the top 5 ranked states, which included 3 Southern states (Kentucky,
Arkansas, and Tennessee), and 2 Western states (Alaska and Nevada).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The proportion of cancer deaths attributable to cigarette
smoking varies substantially across states and is highest in the South, where up to 40% of
cancer deaths in men are caused by smoking. Increasing tobacco control funding,
implementing innovative new strategies, and strengthening tobacco control policies and
programs, federally and in all states and localities, might further increase smoking cessation,
decrease initiation, and reduce the future burden of morbidity and mortality associated with
smoking-related cancers.

and the District of Columbia (DC). For convenience, we refer to
DC as a state hereafter.
Methods
Thisanalysisuseddeidentifiedpubliclyavailabledataandthus
is not considered human subjects research; no institutional re-
view board approval was necessary. We estimated the state-
specific proportion of cigarette smoking–attributable cancer
mortality (SACM) using methods similar to those of the 2014
Surgeon General’
s Report,1 based on 12 cancers caused by ciga-
rette smoking (acute myeloid leukemia and cancers of the oral
cavity and pharynx; esophagus; stomach; colorectum; liver;
pancreas;larynx;trachea,lung,andbronchus;cervixuteri;kid-
ney and renal pelvis; and urinary bladder). To avoid potential
bias, we calculated the overall population-attributable frac-
tion (PAF) for cancer deaths in each state using the weighted
sumsmethod.5Specifically,wefirstcalculatedthePAFforeach
sex and age group (35-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74,
75-79, 80-84, ≥85 years) in each state, using the standard for-
mula for multicategory exposure6:
PAFs = [p0,s + p1,s (RR1,s) + p2,s (RR2,s)] – 1
p0,s + p1,s (RR1,s) + p2,s (RR2,s)
,
where s represents age; p0, p1, and p2, the proportion of never,
former, and current smokers, respectively; and RR1 and RR2,
the relative risk for former and current smokers, respectively,
compared with never smokers.
Age-,sex-,andstate-specificsmokingprevalence(never,for-
mer,orcurrent)werecalculatedonthebasisofdatafromthe2014
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (BRFSS),
which is the only national survey designed to provide reliable
state-levelestimatesofhealthbehaviors.4 Smokingprevalence
estimateswerebasedon372759surveyparticipants35yearsand
olderwhoprovidedinformationonsmokingstatus.Thesesmok-
ingprevalenceestimatesweregeneratedfromtheweightedpub-
licdataprovidedbytheCentersforDiseaseControlandPreven-
tion (CDC). Weighting was based on characteristics such as
sex, age, race and ethnicity, education, and marital status to
adjust for nonresponse bias and ensure that the sample was
representative.7Age-andsex-specific(butnotstate-specific)rela-
tive risks for death for current and former smoking status were
thoseforacompositeoutcomeofanyofthe12smoking-related
cancers as reported from analyses of the Cancer Prevention
Study-II (442 960 participants) and Pooled Contemporary Co-
hort (954 029 participants).3
For each state, the number of smoking-attributable cancer
deathsineachageandsexgroupwascalculatedbymultiplying
the age- and sex-specific PAFs by the corresponding observed
2014cancerdeathcountsobtainedfromtheNationalCenterfor
HealthStatistics.8Thetotalnumberofsmoking-attributablecan-
cerdeathsineachstatewasthencalculatedbysummingacross
allageandsexgroups.Finally,theoverallSACMineachstatewas
calculated by dividing the number of estimated smoking-
attributablecancerdeathsbythetotalnumberofcancerdeaths
among persons 35 years and older in each state. The 95% con-
fidence intervals on the SACM were estimated via a bootstrap
method,9 with 5000 simulations.
To illustrate the geographic variation in SACM, we mapped
the results grouping states by number rank (1 being the high-
est SACM).
Differences in SACM between states may be partly due to
differences between states in racial and ethnic composition be-
causesmokingprevalencesubstantiallyvariesbyrace/ethnicity.2
To compare a measure of SACM between states that was not in-
fluencedbyracialandethniccomposition,wecalculatedSACM
by state for non-Hispanic white (NHW) men. We then assessed
whethervariationinSACMacrossstatesinNHWmenwassimi-
lar to that for all races/ethnicities combined using the Spear-
man correlation. Sparse data precluded similar comparison for
other racial/ethnic and sex groups. However, we also calcu-
lated national SACM estimates for NHWs, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Hispanics using smoking prevalence from the National
HealthInterviewSurvey(NHIS)(51637participants35yearsand
older) during 2013 to 201410 and relative risks of cancer death
as described herein.
Finally, as a sensitivity analysis, we compared the SACM
in 4 regions (South, Midwest, West, and Northeast according
to the Bureau of Census classification)11 using smoking preva-
lence from the NHIS with that estimated using smoking preva-
lence from the BRFSS. We used Stata, version 13.1, and SAS 9.4
to perform the analyses. A 2-sided P value of .05 was used to
determine statistical significance.
Key Points
Question What proportion of cancer deaths are attributable to
cigarette smoking in each US state?
Findings In this study of population-attributed fraction of cancer
deaths due to cigarette smoking, cigarette smoking explained a
high proportion of cancer deaths in all states, but this proportion
was highest in several Southern states, notably Kentucky,
Arkansas, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Louisiana.
Meaning Strengthened tobacco control is needed to reduce the
burden of cancer death in all states.

Results
In2014,atleast167133cancerdeaths(28.6%ofallcancerdeaths)

utabletocigarettesmoking,with103 609ofthesedeathsoccur-
ring in men (62.0%) and 63 524 in women (38.0%) (Table). The
proportion of SACM ranged from 21.8% in Utah to 39.5% in Ar-
kansasamongmen,andfrom11.1%inUtahto29.0%inKentucky
amongwomen.Manyofthestateswiththehighestproportions

tucky, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Oklahoma)
(Figure1).Notably,smokingexplainednearly40%ofadultmale

top 10 SACM states among women as well, but the second- and
third-ranked states were Alaska (27.5%) and Nevada (27.1%)—
whichranked18thand20th,respectively,amongmen.Forboth
sexescombined,7ofthetop10stateswerelocatedintheSouth,

souri). While California had the lowest SACM after Utah, it had
thehighestnumberofdeathsexplainedbysmoking,becauseof
its large population.
State-specific rankings for NHW men were generally simi-
lar to those for all races/ethnicities combined (Spearman cor-
relation coefficient = 0.91, P < .001), with the notable excep-
tionofDC(SACMof18.5%inNHWmenvs33.3%inmenoverall)
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Nationally, non-Hispanic blacks
had the highest SACM (27.2%), followed by NHWs (26.0%) and
Hispanics (19.8%) (Figure 2). Finally, estimates of SACM at the
regional level using smoking prevalence from the NHIS were
equivalent to those estimated using smoking prevalence from
the BRFSS (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Inmoststates,approximatelyone-thirdofcancerdeathsinmen
and one-quarter in women were explained by cigarette smok-
ing. However, consistent with smoking-attributable all-cause
mortality,12cancerdeathswereassociatedwithcigarettesmok-
ing less often in Western states and more often in the South,
particularly among men. For example, smoking accounted for
nearly 40% of cancer deaths among men in 5 Southern states.
The larger burden of SACM in men than in women likely re-
flects a lower prevalence of smoking among women than men
intheolderbirthcohorts.13,14However,sexdifferencesinSACM
may diminish in the future because smoking histories and risk
of mortality from smoking-related diseases are comparable for
men and women in more recent birth cohorts.15 In fact, fe-
male smoking prevalence recently surpassed male smoking
prevalence in South Dakota, Montana, and Arkansas.16
HigherSACMintheSouthisdrivenbyhigherhistoricsmok-
ing prevalence, which has prevailed in large part due to weaker
tobacco control policies and programs. Policy initiatives are
heavily influenced by the tobacco industry in all states,17,18 es-
peciallythoseintheSouth,19where95%oftheUStobaccocrop
is grown.20 Although spending on tobacco control is in-
versely associated with smoking prevalence,21,22 only 5 states
spent at least 50% of the amount recommended by the CDC
in 2016.23 In particular, 8 of the 21 states that spend less than
10%oftheCDC-recommendedamountarelocatedintheSouth
(Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Caro-
lina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia). Tobacco control spend-
ing by all states combined was less than $500 million in 2016,
far less than the $10 billion spent annually by the tobacco in-
dustry on marketing.24
Public smoking restrictions and high cigarette prices
(through excise taxes, price promotion restrictions, and mini-
mum price laws)25 are among the most effective tobacco con-
trol policies,26,27 and both are primarily legislated by states.
Again, the least restrictive public smoking policies and most
affordable cigarettes are found in the South. Nine of 14 states
with the least comprehensive smoke-free indoor air laws are
in this region28 and the mean cigarette excise tax is $0.49 in
major tobacco states, compared with $1.80 in other states (and
as high as $4.35 in New York).29 However, there are signs that
the tobacco industry’
s influence has waned somewhat in
Southern tobacco-growing states in recent years, facilitating
improvementintobaccocontrolpolicies30andhighlightingthe
opportunity for more rapid progress in the future.
ThehigherSACMinSouthernstatesmayalsobedueinpart
to disproportionately high levels of low socioeconomic sta-
tus, which is associated with higher smoking prevalence2 and
lower smoking cessation rates.31 Smoking prevalence among
adultswithahighschooleducationorlessare2to4timesthose
among college graduates,2 and people with a lower educa-
tional attainment are less aware of the health hazards of
smoking.32 Only half (50%) of adults in Kentucky have more
than a high school education, compared with 68% in
Colorado.31 In addition, racial differences in smoking preva-
lence and population distribution may account for some varia-
tionintheSACMbystate.Forexample,blackmenhaveahigher
SACM and a higher proportion of smoking-attributable all-
cause mortality,33 reflecting historically higher smoking preva-
lencecomparedwithwhitemen.34InsomeSouthernstates(eg,
Louisiana, Mississippi), blacks account for more than 30% of
the population compared with less than 5% in many Western
andNorthernstates(eg,Utah,Connecticut).35Conversely,some
states, such as California and Texas, are disproportionately
populated by Hispanics,35 among whom SACM is lower. Nev-
ertheless, the SACM by state for NHW men is generally simi-
lar to that of all men, indicating that variation in racial com-
position is unlikely to be the driving factor for state differences
in SACM. Of note, DC showed the lowest SACM for NHW men,
reflecting the large proportion of highly educated men (85%
with a bachelor’
s degree or more)31 in whom awareness about
the health hazards of smoking is highest.32 The compara-
tively low SACM in Utah reflects the religious prohibition of
smoking among Mormons.36
In addition to Southern states, Alaska and Nevada had par-
ticularly high SACM, especially among women. In Alaska,
whichhadthesecondhighestSACMinwomen,smokingpreva-
lence was the same in men and women in 2009, in contrast to
most states where it was 10% to 60% higher in men.16

allowssmokinginbarsandcasinos.37Apreviousstudyofsmok-
ing-attributable all-cause mortality found that Nevada had the
highest fraction of deaths explained by smoking of any state.38
Missouri is another non-Southern state with high SACM, rank-
ing seventh for both sexes combined. It has the lowest ciga-
rette excise tax ($0.17) of any state, 90% lower than the na-
tional mean of $1.65.29
Tobaccocontrolhasbeencreditedwithpreventingapproxi-
mately8millionprematuredeathsintheUnitedStatesoverthe
past 5 decades, equivalent to 157 million years of life saved.39
Our data show that there remains the potential to avert many
more premature deaths in light of suboptimal funding for to-
bacco control programs, not only in the South, but in all states.
As of 2016, two-thirds of states lack 100% smoke-free laws in
public places to protect the general public from second-hand
smoke40; no state41 has taxes on cigarettes that account for at
least 75% of the retail price, as recommended by the World
HealthOrganization42;andonly1state(NorthDakota)fundsits
tobacco control programs at the level recommended by the
CDC.23 The Affordable Care Act includes coverage of cessation
treatments without cost-sharing for the privately and Medi-
care insured. However, for Medicaid enrollees—who are twice
aslikelytosmoke2—coverageisstategoverned,andonly7states
provide comprehensive coverage (Connecticut, Indiana, Mas-
sachusetts,Minnesota,Nevada,Pennsylvania,andVermont).43
Although there has generally been a stagnation in the adop-
tionoftraditionalcomprehensivetobaccocontrol,44somestates
andlocalitieshaveimplementedinnovativeapproachestofight
the tobacco epidemic. For instance, California, Hawaii, and 145
smaller localities have increased the tobacco sales age to 21
years45—a measure supported by the Institute of Medicine.46
Likewise, communities across the United States have passed

States are ranked by the proportion of cancer deaths attributable to cigarette
smoking, from highest (1) to lowest (51). States were categorized into 4 groups
(group 1, states ranked 1-10; group 2, rank 11-40; group 3, rank 41-50; and group
4, Utah alone as the proportion was substantially lower than in any other state).
The color of the state indicates the rank group. aWashington, DC.

Limitations
Our study likely underestimated deaths caused by tobacco use
forseveralreasons.First,only12cancerswereincluded,forcon-
sistency with the Surgeon General’
s report1; however, cigarette
smoking is associated with excess mortality for additional
cancers.3,51 Second, self-reported data are known to underesti-
mate smoking prevalence.52 Third, deaths caused by tobacco
exposuresotherthanactivecigarettesmoking,includingsecond-
handsmoke,pipes,hookahs,cigars,smokelesstobacco,andelec-
tronicnicotinedeliverysystems,werenotincludedinouranaly-
sis. Due to changing patterns of tobacco use,53 products other
than cigarettes may account for a greater proportion of all
tobacco-relatedcancerdeathsinthefuture.Finally,confidence
intervalsforSACMinsomestateswererelativelywideduetolim-
ited precision of smoking prevalence estimates available from
the BRFSS in some age groups. However, the BRFSS is the only
national survey designed to provide estimates of state-level
smokingstatus.AlthoughtheresponseratefortheBRFSSislower
(47%) than that for the NHIS (61%),10 the surveys report gener-
allycomparablesmokingprevalenceestimates,54 whichgener-
atesimilarSACMwhencomparedattheregionallevel.Notably,
higher SACM was less apparent in the Census Bureau–defined
Southern region because it includes states such as Maryland,
which has exceptionally low smoking prevalence (16.4% in
2013),55 and Texas, which has a large lower-smoking Hispanic
population.56 This illustrates the high variability of smoking-
attributable disease within regions and supports the value of
state-specific analyses.
Conclusions
The proportion of cancer deaths attributable to cigarette smok-
ingvariessubstantiallyacrossstatesandishighestintheSouth,
where up to 40% of cancer deaths in men are caused by smok-
ing. However, the human costs of cigarette smoking are high
in all states, regardless of ranking. Increasing tobacco control
funding, implementing innovative new strategies, and
strengthening tobacco control policies and programs, feder-
allyandinallstatesandlocalities,mightfurtherincreasesmok-
ing cessation, decrease initiation, and reduce the future bur-
den of smoking-related cancers.
