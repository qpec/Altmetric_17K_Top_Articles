Study Objectives: A large proportion of individuals affected by sleep disorders are untreated and susceptible to accidents, injuries, long-term sequelae 
(e.g., risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, psychiatric disorders), and increased mortality risk. Few studies have examined the scope and magnitude of 
sleep disorder diagnoses in the United States (US) or factors influencing them. Veterans are particularly vulnerable to factors that elicit or exacerbate sleep 
disorders.
Methods: This serial cross-sectional study characterized secular trends in diagnosed sleep disorders among veterans seeking care in US Veterans Health 
Administration facilities over an eleven-year span (FY2000–2010, n = 9,786,778). Electronic medical records from the national Veterans Administration 
Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database were accessed. Cases were defined using diagnostic codes specified by the American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine. Age-adjusted annual prevalence was summarized by sex, race, combat exposure, body mass index, and comorbid diagnoses (cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, mental disorders).
Results: Sleep apnea (47%) and insomnia (26%) were the most common diagnoses among patients with any sleep disorder. There was a six-fold relative 
increase in total sleep disorder prevalence over the study period. Posttraumatic stress disorder, which tripled over the same time period, was associated with 
the highest prevalence of sleep disorders (16%) among the comorbid conditions evaluated.
Conclusions: The results indicate a growing need for integration of sleep disorder management with patient care and health care planning among US veterans.

INTRODUCTION
Sleep is considered a physiological necessity, and inadequate 
sleep has been associated with a wide range of adverse phys-
ical, mental and behavioral outcomes.1 Previous studies have 
linked abnormal sleep duration or a sleep disorder diagnosis 
with an increased incidence of: obesity, hypertension or meta-
bolic syndrome,2–5 type 2 diabetes,2,3,6 cardiovascular dis-
ease,7–9 stroke,10,11 and cancer 12–17 (although results for cancer 
have been less consistent). Other studies have linked inade-
quate sleep with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders (e.g., 
depression, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), suicides, 
accidents, injuries, reduced quality of life, and increased mor-
tality.1,9,18–26 The impacts of sleep disruption may be mediated 
by several pathophysiological processes. These include sympa-
thetic nervous system hyperarousal, the disruption of circadian 
rhythms, neuroendocrine or immune system dysregulation, in-
flammation, or metabolic dysfunction.27–30
Military personnel are particularly vulnerable to sleep dis-
turbances due to the irregularity of their sleep/wake sched-
ules, austere living conditions (e.g., extremes in temperature,

Significance
Trends in diagnosed sleep disorders were characterized among United States veterans seeking care in Veterans Health Administration facilities between 
FY2000 and FY2010 (n = 9,786,778). A six-fold relative increase in the age-adjusted prevalence of any sleep disorder diagnosis was observed during 
the study period. The largest increases were observed among those with posttraumatic stress disorder, other mental health disorders, or combat 
experience. Veterans with cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other chronic diseases also experienced higher rates of sleep disorder diagnoses relative 
to those without such conditions. This study identified a growing need for integration of sleep disorder management with veteran care and health care 
planning.
noise, physical exertion), the stress of combat, elevated rates 
of physical and psychological injury, and issues associated 
with post-deployment psychosocial reintegration.23,31 Some 
of these conditions can have residual effects well after the 
period of service is over. Therefore, veterans can be plagued 
with multiple comorbidities and exposures that adversely influ-
ence sleep. Some of these are over-represented in this popula-
tion (e.g., musculoskeletal pain, traumatic brain injury [TBI], 
smoking, substance abuse, hypertension, depression, PTSD), 
while others mirror trends in the general United States (US) 
population (e.g., obesity, aging-related chronic disease).23,24,31–34 
Consequently, sleep disruption tends to be more common 
among veterans than in the general population.23,35–40 However, 
the national scope and characteristics of this problem have not 
been described previously.
Despite evidence indicating that a lack of recognition or poor 
management of sleep disorders can have myriad detrimental 
health consequences, many patients can remain undiagnosed 
or untreated.41,42 For example, it was estimated that 80% to 90% 
of people with clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing

may remain undiagnosed.43 In a representative sample of US 
adults, 26% of survey respondents met criteria for high-risk 
obstructive sleep apnea44 in contrast to an estimated preva-
lence of ~4% to 10%.45–47 An increasing trend in office visits 
for sleep disorders was reported among US adults from 1999 
to 2010, although it is unclear whether this was due to a true 
increase in sleep disorder prevalence, increasing awareness 
among physicians or their patients, or a combination of both.19 
Differences in sleep disorder case definitions, diagnostic cri-
teria, population demographics, or the presence of comorbid 
disease also can contribute to inconsistencies among popula-
tion-based sleep disorder estimates.
The co-occurrence of a sleep disorder with another co-
morbid chronic disease can predict poor quality of life48,49 and 
earlier mortality relative to those without a sleep disorder.9,26,50 
This suggests that appropriate sleep disorder management may 
improve quality of life and longevity. In some studies, psychi-
atric disorders were predictive of sleep problems,51,52 but in 
other cases sleep disorders predicted increased risks for psy-
chiatric disorders.53–55 This apparent bi-directionality can com-
plicate etiologic studies, but it also highlights the importance 
of disease prevention and control strategies that integrate ap-
propriate sleep management.
The information described above suggests that sleep dis-
order surveillance can play an important role in patient care and 
long-term health care planning. The characterization of trends 
in sleep disorder diagnoses among population subgroups may 
allow clinicians to identify and target high-risk patients who 
would benefit from management of sleep disorders and their 
sequelae. Most epidemiologic studies examining sleep dis-
orders have been limited to: selected study populations (e.g., 
those attending sleep clinics), relatively small sample sizes, 
or to a single type of sleep disorder or risk factor of interest. 
This study evaluated all diagnosed sleep disorders in a national 
sample of US veterans who utilized health services through the 
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) between FY2000 and 
FY2010. The VHA is the largest integrated health care system 
utilizing electronic medical records in the US.56 The approach 
facilitated the examination of comorbid diseases that appear at 
higher rates among veterans relative to the general population 
(e.g., PTSD and other mental health disorders), as well as other 
individual or clinical factors that may influence the onset or 
severity of sleep disorders.
METHODS
Study Population
The study population consisted of all US veterans seeking care 
in the VHA system between FY2000 and FY2010. Following 
regulatory approvals, outpatient electronic medical records 
were accessed from MedSAS Dataset and Department of Vet-
erans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse files using the 
US Veterans Administration Informatics and Computing Infra-
structure (VINCI) system. Requested data elements from dif-
ferent VA system files were linked via social security number 
by a system data manager, and then scrambled and replaced 
with a unique patient identification number. Unique identifiers 
were therefore inaccessible to the study investigators. Patients 
excluded were: < 18 years old on January 1 of each year, vet-
erans who died in a given fiscal year, spouses of veterans re-
ceiving care, and non-veterans.
Case Ascertainment
De-identified outpatient sleep disorder diagnoses were grouped 
according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine Interna-
tional Classification of Sleep Disorder57 categories based on 
the following ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision) codes: sleep apneas (organic sleep apnea 
[327.20–327.29], unspecified sleep apnea [780.57]); insomnias 
(organic insomnias [327.00–327.09], insomnias, unspecified 
[780.51–780.52], nonorganic insomnias [307.41–307.42]); other 
sleep disorders (other organic sleep disorder [327.80], spe-
cific disorders of sleep of nonorganic origin [307.40–307.49], 
other sleep disturbances, unspecified [780.50, 780.56, 780.59], 
other sleep disorders [291.82, 292.85]); hypersomnias (organic 
hypersomnias [327.10–327.19], nonorganic hypersomnias 
[307.43–307.44], hypersomnias, unspecified [780.53–780.54], 
other hypersomnias [347.00–347.01, 347.10–347.11]); para-
somnias (organic parasomnias [327.40–327.49], nonorganic 
parasomnias [307.46–307.47]); sleep disruption movement 
disorders (organic sleep related movement disorders [327.51–
327.59], sleep related movement disorder, unspecified [780.58], 
Restless Legs Syndrome [333.94]); and circadian rhythm disor-
ders (organic circadian rhythm sleep disorders [327.30–327.39], 
circadian rhythm sleep disorder of nonorganic origin [307.45], 
disruption of 24-hour sleep wake cycle, unspecified [780.55]). 
Veterans were assigned a specific sleep disorder diagnosis if 
their ICD-9 code occurred at least 2 times within a given fiscal 
year, and the codes occurred 30 or more days apart.58 This 
method was used to reduce the chance of misclassification due 
to “rule out” diagnoses, which are ICD-9 codes that are entered 
by providers as the reason for ordering a diagnostic test. This 
more conservative approach may not have identified all cases 
(e.g., if their first visit occurred near the end of a FY), and may 
have underestimated case frequencies relative to other studies.
Sleep-related medical procedures were ascertained using 
the following current procedural technology (CPT) codes: 
0203T (sleep study, unattended, simultaneous recording of: 
heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory analysis and sleep 
type; type II device), 0204T (sleep study, unattended, simul-
taneous recording of: heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory 
analysis and sleep type; type IV device), 95805 (multiple sleep 
latency or maintenance of wakefulness testing, recording anal-
ysis and interpretation of physiological measurements of sleep 
during multiple trials to assess sleepiness), 95806 (sleep study, 
unattended, simultaneous recording of heart rate, oxygen 
saturation, respiratory airflow and respiratory effort [electro-
encephalogram [EEG], thoracoabdominal movement] with 
type III device), 95807 (sleep study, simultaneous recording 
of ventilation, respiratory effort, electrocardiogram [ECG] or 
heart rate, and oxygen saturation, attended by a technologist), 
99508 (home visit for polysomnography and sleep studies), 
95810 (polysomnography with sleep staging and ≥ 4 sleep pa-
rameters, attended by technologist), 95811 (polysomnography 
for initiation of continuous positive airway pressure therapy 
or bilevel ventilation, attended by technologist), G0398 (home

sleep test [HST] with type II portable monitor, unattended; 
minimum of 7 channels: EEG, electrooculogram, electromyo-
gram, ECG/heart rate, airflow, respiratory effort and oxygen 
saturation), G0399 (HST with type III portable monitor, unat-
tended; minimum of 4 channels: 2 respiratory movement/air-
flow, 1 ECG/heart rate, and 1 oxygen saturation), and G0400 
(HST with type IV portable monitor, unattended; minimum of 
3 channels).
Covariates
Data on covariates (age, race/ethnicity, sex, smoking status, 
body mass index [BMI], income, comorbid diagnoses, sleep-
related medical procedures, service period [World War II, Ko-
rean War, Vietnam War, Persian Gulf War, Operation Enduring 
Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom, and other], and combat 
deployment) were retrieved from the VHA’s Vital Status and 
MedSAS databases. Income was divided into 3 categories: less 
than $20,000 a year, $20,000 or more, or unknown.59 Race and 
ethnicity were categorized as: Non-Hispanic White, Non-His-
panic Black, Hispanic or Mexican, or “Other” (includes Amer-
ican Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other 
Pacific Islander, or more than one race). Missing race may be 
associated with lower rates of utilization and fewer comorbid 
diseases,60 and thus was included as a separate category. Age, 
in years, was calculated by subtracting the year of birth from 
the fiscal year of contact with the VHA system and grouped 
into the following categories: 18–29 years, 30–39 years, 40–49 
years, 50–59 years, 60–69 years, 70–79 years, and 80 years or 
older. The 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) 
were collapsed into US census regions (VISNs 1–5 = Northeast; 
10–15 and 23 = Midwest; 6–9, 16, 17 = South; 18–22 = West). 
Those with missing or infrequent VISN assignment were coded 
as unknown. BMI was calculated using height and weight after 
excluding biologically implausible values; height was restricted 
to 48–84 inches (122–213 cm), and weight was restricted to 75–
500 pounds (34–227 kg).61 If a value for height was missing for 
a given record, any appearance of height across the study pe-
riod was used. Multiple entries for biologically plausible values 
of weight were averaged within the fiscal year. BMI was cat-
egorized into the following groups: underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), 
normal (18.5 to < 25 kg/m2), overweight (≥ 25 and < 30 kg/
m2), and obese (≥ 30 kg/m2). The underweight BMI category 
(< 1% of study population) was combined with the normal BMI 
group. Smoking status was assessed as described previously62; 
data extracted from electronic medical records were compared 
to self-reported smoking data found in the Veterans Aging Co-
hort Study (VACS-8) and VACS Virtual Cohort study, which 
yielded kappa (κ) statistics of 0.66 and 0.61, respectively.
ICD-9 codes for comorbid disease were grouped into the 
following categories: asthma (493), cancer (150–151, 153–155, 
157, 162, 172, 174, 183, 185, 188–189, 191, 200, 202, 204–208.9), 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (496.0), car-
diovascular disease (CVD) (390–459), diabetes (249–250), 
fibromyalgia (729.1), gastrointestinal (GI) disease (520–579), 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (042–044), any mental 
disorder (290–319), renal disease (508–589), and stroke (434.91) 
using the same criteria as described for sleep disorders. Di-
agnoses of any mental disorder/mental disability was broken 
down into the following subgroups for further analyses: de-
pression (296.3), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (309.81), 
other mental health disorders with the exception of PTSD and 
depression (e.g., psychosis [290–299], neurotic disorders, per-
sonality disorders, and other nonpsychotic mental disorders 
[300–316], mental disability [317–319]).
Statistical Analyses
Annual sleep disorder prevalence was calculated as the propor-
tion of total sleep disorder diagnoses among eligible patients 
seeking care in the VHA system each fiscal year of the study. 
The numerator was defined as the total number of primary 
sleep disorder diagnoses (or specific sleep disorder subtype) 
that occurred during each fiscal year, and the denominator was 
the total number of veterans seeking care through the VHA 
during in the same fiscal year. Annual prevalence was adjusted 
for possible changes in the age distribution over time via di-
rect age standardization using the 2000 US standard popula-
tion and the following age groups: 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 
60–69, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years old.63 Absolute change in preva-
lence across the study period was defined as the age-adjusted 
prevalence estimate for FY2000 subtracted from the age-ad-
justed prevalence for a given fiscal year. Relative changes were 
described as well, where the age-adjusted prevalence estimate 
for FY2000 was subtracted from the age-adjusted prevalence 
for a given fiscal year and divided by the age-adjusted preva-
lence estimate for FY2000. Prevalence and absolute change 
in prevalence of sleep disorders were stratified by comorbid 
CVD and cancer diagnoses, as they represent the top causes 
of mortality in the US, PTSD (a common diagnosis among US 
veterans), and other selected factors (sex, race, BMI, combat 
exposure). Two-sample proportion tests were used to compare 
proportions of select factors in FY2000 and FY2010.
RESULTS
Data for 9,786,778 veteran patients were included in the anal-
ysis (Table 1). Figure 1 summarizes inclusions and exclusions 
among patients who sought care through the VHA during the 
study period. The study population consisted primarily of men 
(93%) who were married (54%). Differences in the character-
istics of veterans seeking care through the VHA from FY2000 
to FY2010 are presented in Table S1 in the supplemental mate-
rial. At the beginning of the study period, veterans 70–79 years 
of age constituted the largest group (~24%, standard error 
[SE]: ± 0.02); and by FY2010, the 60–69 age group was the 
largest (~30%, ± 0.02, Table S1). Among veteran patients diag-
nosed with at least one sleep disorder (n of unique individuals: 
751,502; n of diagnoses: 953,575), sleep apneas made up the 
plurality of the diagnoses (47%); followed by insomnias (26%), 
other sleep disorders (11%), hypersomnias (10%), movement 
disorders (4%), parasomnias (3%), and circadian rhythm sleep 
disorders (0.1%). A majority of those diagnosed with a sleep 
disorder were prescribed at least one sleep medication (91%, 
data not shown). The proportion of veterans with a sleep dis-
order who were prescribed a sleep medication for the entire 
time they sought care within the VHA during the study period 
ranged from 24% to 64% (average: 37%) based on the number 
of years of follow-up (data not shown).

Sleep Disorder Epidemiology among Veterans—Alexander et al.
Total sleep disorder diagnoses increased nearly 6-fold over 
the 11-year study period (Figure 2). Sleep apnea and insomnia 
prevalence exhibited more than a 7-fold relative increase; 
age-adjusted sleep apnea prevalence increased from 0.4% in 
FY2000 to 3.0% in FY2010 (a relative increase of 650%); and 
age-adjusted insomnia prevalence in-
creased from 0.2% in FY2000 to 1.5% 
in FY2010 (also a 650% relative in-
crease). The prevalence of other sleep 
disorders rose from 0.4% in FY2000 
to 0.6% in FY2010 (a relative increase 
of 50%). Less prevalent sleep disorder 
subtypes also increased over time (the 
relative increases were: movement dis-
orders: 1,048%; hypersomnias: 50%; 
parasomnias: 750%; circadian rhythm 
disorders: 900%).
When the pattern of CPT codes 
for sleep procedures over time was 
inspected, there was an approximate 
3-fold increase in the proportion of vet-
eran patients receiving a sleep-related 
procedure during the study period 
(0.5% in FY2000, 1.7% by FY2010). 
These proportions were considerably 
lower than diagnosed sleep disorders; 
one-third to one-half of the observed 
prevalence of sleep disorder diagnoses 
(Figure 3). CPT codes 95810 and 95811 
(polysomnography for sleep staging, 
sleep parameters, or airways therapy, 
attended by a technologist) were the 
most common sleep procedures in 
FY2000 (0.35%) and FY2010 (1.24%), 
corresponding to an almost four-fold 
relative increase during the study pe-
riod. CPT code 95807 (sleep study, 
simultaneous recording of ventilation, 
respiratory effort, ECG or heart rate, 
and oxygen saturation, attended by 
a technologist) was the second most 
common code in FY2000 (0.09%) and 
exhibited a small increase in preva-
lence by the end of the study period 
(0.11%).
Veterans diagnosed with CVD had a 
larger absolute increase in sleep apnea 
prevalence over time compared to vet-
erans without CVD (5.8% and 1.6%, 
respectively, Figure 4). Veterans with 
a CVD diagnosis also experienced 
an absolute increase of insomnia 
prevalence (2.6%) more than double 
the absolute increase among veterans 
without CVD (1.1%). Less common 
sleep disorder subtypes also exhib-
ited greater increases in sleep disorder 
prevalence among those with CVD 
compared to those without CVD.
Figure 5 presents changes in sleep disorder prevalence strat-
ified by cancer diagnosis. From FY2000 to FY2010, absolute 
increases in sleep apnea and insomnia prevalence were 3.7% 
and 2.0%, respectively, among veterans with cancer. These

increases were greater than those recorded among veteran 
patients without a cancer diagnosis (2.5% and 1.3%, respec-
tively). The remaining sleep disorders, with the exception of 
other sleep disorders, exhibited larger increases in prevalence 
among those diagnosed with cancer compared to those who 
were not.
Absolute changes in sleep apnea and insomnia over the 
study period were the largest among veterans with PTSD (5.7% 
and 4.3% from FY2000 to FY2010, respectively, Figure 6). 
Smaller absolute increases in prevalence were observed for the 
other sleep disorder subtypes, ranging from 0.02% (circadian 
rhythm disorders) to 1.4% (other sleep disorders). Increases in 
sleep disorder subtypes over time also were observed when the 
data were stratified by any mental health disorder diagnosis 
(Figure S1 in the supplemental material), any depression di-
agnosis (Figure S2 in the supplemental material), or by mental 
health disorders other than PTSD or depression (Figure S3 in 
the supplemental material), the largest absolute increases were 
observed among those with sleep apnea.
Because combat experience can be related to development 
of PTSD and mental health disorders, the prevalence of sleep 
disorder subtypes also was stratified by combat exposure 
(Figure S4 in the supplemental material). In FY2010, the prev-
alence of sleep apnea and insomnia was 7.6 times and 6.3 times 
greater among combat veterans than noncombat veterans, re-
spectively. A similar pattern was observed for other sleep

disorders. By 2010, there was a greater than 7-fold relative dif-
ference in total sleep disorder prevalence among veterans with 
or without combat experience.
Sleep disorder prevalence also was examined across BMI 
categories (Figures S5a–S5g in the supplemental material). 
As expected, obese veterans (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) experienced 
the largest increase (5.6%) in sleep apnea prevalence over 
time (1.4% in FY2000, 7.0% in FY2010, Figure S5a). For in-
somnia, veterans who were underweight or had normal BMI 
were the fastest growing group, with a 1.8% absolute increase 
in insomnia prevalence over time (0.3% in FY2000, 2.1% in 
FY2010, Figure S5b).
Sleep disorder prevalence stratified by sex is presented over 
the study period in Figure S6 in the supplemental material. 
Male veterans consistently had a higher prevalence of sleep 
apnea across the study period. Female veterans either had the 
same or higher insomnia prevalence until FY2008. There-
after, their rates were exceeded by those among male veterans. 
Trends in sleep disorder prevalence by race and ethnicity are 
presented in Figures S7a–S7g in the supplemental material. 
The largest absolute increase in sleep apnea prevalence over 
the study period (3.1%) was observed among Hispanic or Mex-
ican-American veterans (0.5% in FY2000 to 3.6% in FY2010, 
Figure S7a). This group also had the highest prevalence of 
sleep apnea among those studied. Veterans of unknown race/
ethnicity had the largest absolute increase (1.5%) in insomnia 
prevalence over time (0.3% in FY2000 to 1.8 % in FY2010, 
Figure S7b). The northeast and southern US regions dominated 
increases observed in sleep disorder prevalence (Figures S8a–
S8g in the supplemental material). Specifically, the northeast 
region experienced the greatest absolute increases in sleep 
apnea, circadian rhythm disorders, parasomnias, and other 
sleep disorders; whereas the southern region experienced in-
creases in insomnias, hypersomnias, and movement disorders.
DISCUSSION
In 2000, there were ~26.4 million veterans comprising ~12.7% 
of the US population.64 Results from this study indicate a no-
table rise in sleep disorder diagnoses, especially for sleep apnea 
and insomnia, among US veterans who sought care through 
the VHA from FY2000 through FY2010. The largest increases 
were noted among veterans grouped according to certain de-
mographic or clinical characteristics, particularly those with 
PTSD, other mental health disorders, or combat experience. 
The increasing trends observed in this study are similar to 
results from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey,19 
where a 442% relative increase in office visits for sleep apnea 
was reported among adults within a similar time period (1999–
2010).19 Those investigators acknowledged uncertainty as to 
whether this represented a true increase in prevalence or if it 
was due to heightened awareness, or a combination of factors.
In 2004, veterans requiring the use of breathing assistance 
equipment, such as continuous positive airway pressure de-
vices, were granted a service-connected disability benefit for 
sleep apnea,65 which likely led to more veterans discussing 
sleep complaints with their provider. However, increases in 
sleep disorders in the present study were still observed prior 
to 2004; for example, sleep apnea prevalence nearly doubled 
between FY2000 and FY2003. Thus, the changes in sleep dis-
order prevalence may not have been attributable solely to this 
administrative change. Of note, rates for other sleep disorders 
not covered by the new disability rating also increased during 
the same period.
Potential administrative bias was evaluated in this study by 
examining trends in the utilization of clinical procedures (CPT 
codes) for a sleep disorder diagnosis. The increases in preva-
lence observed for sleep apnea or other sleep disorders did not 
match the magnitude or frequency of diagnostic procedures 
for sleep that were recorded during the same period (Figure 3). 
Some veterans may have sought medical care outside of the 
VHA system.66 A previous investigation found that ~28% of 
veterans reported dual-use primary care (VA and non-VA).67 
It is unknown whether such patients may have preferentially 
sought care for sleep disorders at non-VHA facilities, but the 
possibility cannot be excluded.
Other study uncertainties include a lack of information on 
the relative proportions or influx of certified sleep physicians 
entering the VHA system during the study period, or the ex-
tent to which updates in diagnostic criteria may have influ-
enced national trends in sleep disorder diagnoses among VHA 
providers. The Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical 
Education initiated a national sleep medicine training and cer-
tification program in 2004–2005,68 which coincides with the 
increase in movement disorder diagnoses that were virtually 
absent within the VHA medical record in prior years. This 
suggests that providers may not have been trained to recognize 
these sleep disorders, and that veterans may have been under-
diagnosed for these conditions prior to the initiation of this 
program. A recent inventory of VHA sleep medicine programs 
indicated that demand for sleep services is high and that there 
is considerable variability in the types of services offered; 28% 
had more advanced facilities, whereas 17% did not offer any 
formal sleep services.69
Only a few studies have examined the prevalence of di-
agnosed sleep disorders in a national sample, and several of 
those studies focused on veterans.59,60,70 Prior investigations 
examined prevalence over a shorter time frame (i.e., across 
one or two fiscal years) and/or evaluated a single type of sleep 
disorder.59,60,70 In the current study, sleep apnea prevalence 
ranged from 0.4% to 3.0%. A large cohort study examining the 
relationship between sleep apnea and psychiatric comorbidi-
ties reported a sleep apnea prevalence of 2.9% in a two-year 
period (FY1998–2001),70 which exceeds the current study’s 
prevalence of 0.4% in FY2001. Another investigation of sleep 
apnea among veterans ≥ 65 years old (FY2003–2005) utilized 
criteria similar to the present study (sleep apnea cases were 
defined as individuals with two outpatient diagnoses ≥ 7 days 
apart, or one inpatient diagnosis) and reported a sleep apnea 
prevalence of 4.4%.60 In the current study, a sleep apnea preva-
lence of 3.6% was obtained when the population was restricted 
to veterans ≥ 65 years old in FY2005, which is reasonably con-
sistent with previous studies.60,70
Insomnia prevalence in the current study ranged from 0.4% 
to 1.5%. Another recent study of insomnia prevalence reported 
that 3.4% of veterans had insomnia in FY2010,59 which is more 
than double the prevalence found in the current study in the

same year (1.5%), but is consistent with the prevalence of self-
reported, physician-diagnosed insomnia that was recently 
described in a nationally representative sample of the non-in-
stitutionalized US population (1.2%).46 Inconsistencies in sleep 
disorder prevalence reported among different studies may be 
due to differences in case definitions (e.g., some studies used 
a single occurrence of sleep disorder, which could overesti-
mate case frequencies), or a tendency for physicians to consider 
sleep impairment as a comorbid symptom rather than a diag-
nosable disorder. The current study may have underestimated 
the true prevalence of sleep disorders among veterans since 
the use of ICD-9 codes only captures those who are diagnosed 
and misses those who may have a clinically important but un-
diagnosed sleep disorder.43,44 Differences in population demo-
graphics, comorbidities, or the time period studied also may 
contribute to differences in sleep disorder prevalence among 
published studies.
An increase in the prevalence of comorbid diseases may 
have contributed to the increasing trend of sleep disorder di-
agnoses observed in this study. Veterans with cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, or mental health disorders (particularly PTSD) 
experienced higher rates of sleep disorder diagnoses relative 
to those without such conditions, a phenomenon that has been 
observed in other populations.71–73 Veterans tend to have more 
mental disorders compared to the general population,9,26,50,74–77 
and the co-occurrence of sleep disorders among those with 
PTSD or other psychiatric disorders has been previously de-
scribed.39,51–55,78 The current study used two occurrences of a 
PTSD diagnosis to identify veterans with PTSD, which has a 
positive predictive value (PPV) of 82%, whereas a single oc-
currence had a PPV of 75%.79 A 12-month prevalence study 
of DSM-IV disorders indicated that 3.5% of Americans had 
PTSD,80 which is similar to what was observed in the present 
study during the same time period (FY2001–2003, 3.3–3.5%). 
PTSD prevalence in this study also was within the range previ-
ously reported among veterans (2–17%).81 PTSD rates among 
veterans increased three-fold over the 11-year period, an abso-
lute increase of almost 7%. It was the greatest change among 
the mental health disorders evaluated, resulting in a PTSD 
prevalence of 10% by FY2010. The US’ multiple-front war ef-
fort that occurred during this period likely contributed to this 
striking trend.82
Sleep disturbances are a significant component of PTSD; 
some studies report that sleep disturbances can predict the de-
velopment of PTSD or depression.24 However, there is no clear 
consensus on the cause-effect relationship between sleep disor-
ders and psychiatric outcomes, and these relationships may be 
bi-directional, depending on individual context. For example, 
one study found that insomnia preceded a current anxiety dis-
order in less than 20% of cases, that anxiety appeared prior to 
insomnia in 44% of cases, and that these disorders co-occurred 
in approximately 40% of cases.55 In a community-based study 
of adolescents with comorbid disorders, prior insomnia was 
not associated with onset of anxiety disorders, but nearly 75% 
had anxiety prior to their insomnia diagnosis. Another inves-
tigation also found that generalized anxiety disorder and/or 
depression predicted increases in sleep problems over time.53 
This suggests that mental health disorders including PTSD 
may be driving secular trends in sleep disorder prevalence 
among veterans, although the cross-sectional nature of the cur-
rent study precludes an ability to infer causality. Some studies 
indicate that sleep problems can persist even after amelioration 
of PTSD or TBI symptoms, and that sleep improvement can 
facilitate better responses to PTSD therapy.24 Others reported 
that successful treatment of sleep apnea led to clinically mean-
ingful improvements in PTSD symptoms.83–85 This highlights 
the importance of integrated strategies to ameliorate the long-
term combined impacts of mental and sleep-related disorders 
among VHA patients.
An aging population has been frequently cited as a factor that 
could be driving an increase in sleep disorder prevalence, par-
ticularly sleep apnea. Age-standardization in the present study 
eliminated potential biases that may have been introduced due 
to a shift in the age distribution among veteran patients during 
the study period. Examination of changes within specific age 
groups over time did not provide strong evidence for aging as 
an explanation for the observed trends (Tables S1 and S2 in the 
supplemental material), and age-adjusted sleep disorder preva-
lence did not differ notably from crude rates (data not shown).
One unexpected finding was that sleep apnea prevalence 
did not display a monotonic increase with age (Table S2), 
which has been cited previously as a strong predictor of this 
disorder.86 Instead, the prevalence of sleep apnea was highest 
among veterans 40–69 years old (Table S2). Discrepancies 
with other reports may be due to differences in the criteria 
used to diagnose sleep apnea, the types of sleep apnea included 
in the analyses (i.e., obstructive, central, and mixed), not ac-
counting for therapy or other comorbid conditions, or a combi-
nation of these factors. A previous study using either clinical 
or laboratory-based criteria found that sleep apnea prevalence 
peaked among middle-aged men.87 Older veterans may be 
less likely to seek medical care for sleep disruption symptoms 
since they are more likely to be retired and the consequences 
of sleep disruption may be less likely to interfere with daily 
activities. Although veteran patients ≥ 80 years old exhibited 
the largest increase among age groups over time (Table S1), 
they consistently had among the lowest rates of sleep disorder 
diagnoses in this population (Table S2). Another explanation 
may be related to provider practices.59 As veterans return from 
deployment in recent conflicts, PTSD, or other comorbid diag-
noses can arise, which may make it more likely that providers 
diagnose these veterans with sleep disorders relative to older 
veterans or those not deployed.59
The obesity epidemic has been cited as another factor influ-
encing elevated sleep disorder prevalence, and veterans have 
experienced increases in obesity over time that could account, 
in part, for increases in sleep apnea prevalence observed in the 
current study.33,61 Previous investigations also have reported 
an increased incidence of insomnia among obese individ-
uals.88 However, the prevalence of insomnia, the second-most 
common sleep disorder, rose fastest among veteran patients in 
the normal BMI category, which suggests that other factors, 
such as comorbid disease, may have had a predominant role in 
the trends observed in the present study.
The strengths of this study included its large sample size, 
use of validated methods for characterizing sleep outcomes

and important covariates, and a medical care system that en-
sured equal access to care. Furthermore, prevalence estimates 
were age-adjusted to account for changes in age distribution, 
and CPT codes for sleep procedures were examined to eval-
uate potential reporting bias over time. This study consisted 
of serial cross-sectional data, and was therefore subject to 
limitations typically associated with this type of study design, 
including a lack of appropriate temporal sequencing between 
sleep disorder diagnoses and their predictors or modifiers. Fur-
thermore, this investigation used only data from veterans who 
sought care through the VHA system, resulting in an over-rep-
resentation of older men with multiple comorbidities and lim-
iting the generalizability of the results among patients outside 
the VHA.89 Sleep disorder prevalence may have been overesti-
mated due to the distribution of age or comorbid disease in this 
population. However, prevalence values were age-adjusted and 
stricter criteria were used for case definitions (two diagnostic 
codes ≥ 30 days apart) to reduce potential misclassification. 
This may have resulted in more conservative estimates of sleep 
disorder prevalence relative to some other studies.
In summary, results from this study suggest that prevalence 
of sleep disorder diagnoses increased among US veterans be-
tween FY2000 and FY2010, which may have important im-
plications for the health and longevity of this population. The 
trajectory of sleep disorder diagnoses over the study period 
suggests that upward trends may continue beyond FY2010. 
Sleep disturbances are linked with increased morbidity and 
mortality. For example, recent meta-analyses reported 10% to 
12% increases in mortality risk among those with short sleep 
duration,20,21 and clinically significant, untreated sleep apnea 
has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
disease and all-cause mortality.90 The cross-sectional nature of 
the current study precludes resolution of the complex interre-
lationships between factors such as comorbid chronic disease, 
obesity, and sleep disorder diagnoses. Thus, further exami-
nation of these issues using other study designs is warranted. 
Early identification and adequate treatment of the expanding 
population of veterans with diagnosed sleep disorders may 
lead to lower health care utilization and improved quality of 
life for those patients.
