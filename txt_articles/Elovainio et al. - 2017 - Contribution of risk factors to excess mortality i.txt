Summary
Background The associations of social isolation and loneliness with premature mortality are well known, but the risk 
factors linking them remain unclear. We sought to identify risk factors that might explain the increased mortality in 
socially isolated and lonely individuals.
Methods We used prospective follow-up data from the UK Biobank cohort study to assess self-reported isolation 
(a three-item scale) and loneliness (two questions). The main outcomes were all-cause and cause-specific mortality. 
We calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated by risk factors to assess the extent to which the associations 
of social isolation and loneliness with mortality were attributable to differences between isolated and lonely 
individuals and others in biological (body-mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and handgrip 
strength), behavioural (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity), socioeconomic (education, 
neighbourhood deprivation, and household income), and psychological (depressive symptoms and cognitive 
capacity) risk factors.
Findings 466 901 men and women (mean age at baseline 56·5 years [SD 8·1]) were included in the analyses, with a 
mean follow-up of 6·5 years (SD 0·8). The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for social isolation compared with no 
social isolation was 1·73 (95% CI 1·65–1·82) after adjustment for age, sex, ethnic origin, and chronic disease 
(ie, minimally adjusted), and was 1·26 (95% CI 1·20–1·33) after further adjustment for socioeconomic factors, health-
related behaviours, depressive symptoms, biological factors, cognitive performance, and self-rated health (ie, fully 
adjusted). The minimally adjusted hazard ratio for mortality risk related to loneliness was 1·38 (95% CI 1·30–1·47), 
which reduced to 0·99 (95% CI 0·93–1·06) after full adjustment for baseline risks.
Interpretation Isolated and lonely people are at increased risk of death. Health policies addressing risk factors such as 
adverse socioeconomic conditions, unhealthy lifestyle, and lower mental wellbeing might reduce excess mortality 
among the isolated and the lonely.

Introduction
Socially isolated and lonely individuals have a higher 
mortality risk than people with social contacts.1–5 Several 
factors might contribute to these associations.6 According 
to one hypothesis, losing social connections and feeling 
lonely could be associated with depressive mood and 
cognitive decline,7 with accompanying downstream 
biological changes such as increased cortisol secretion, 
deterioration in immune function, and weight gain.6 
Social isolation could also be associated with unhealthy 
lifestyle factors, such as increased smoking, increased 
alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity.8 Similarly, 
socioeconomic adversity is associated with an increased 
likelihood of social isolation,9 and thus might explain the 
reported associations. However, few extensive prospective 
data exist on which to test these hypotheses and assess 
the associations in different groups such as old and 
young individuals, low and high socioeconomic groups, 
and those with and without chronic disease. All these 
factors might confound the association of social isolation 
and loneliness with mortality.
A better understanding of the factors underlying the 
associations between social isolation (ie, having no or 
few contacts with others), loneliness (ie, feeling lonely or 
unable to share one’s thoughts), and mortality might 
facilitate the design of inter 
ventions to reduce excess 
health risk in socially isolated, lonely people. We used 
data from the UK Biobank study to quantify the extent to 
which the associations of social isolation and loneliness 
with mortality are related to biological, behavioural, 
socioeconomic, and psychological risk factors.

these records, invitations were sent to individuals aged 
40–69 years living within a sensible travelling distance of 
the 22 assessment centres across Great Britain in 
2007–10.10 For the UK Biobank project, baseline 
questionnaires and physical measures (eg, standard 
anthropometry and spirometry) were collected and blood 
and urine samples were stored, as described elsewhere.11 
502 656 individuals were recruited (5% of the eligible 
population) in the UK Biobank. 
This study was done under generic approval from the 
National Health Service National Research Ethics Service 
(June 17, 2011; Ref 11/NW
/0382). Participants provided 
electronic informed consent for the baseline assessments 
and the register linkage.
Procedures
The social isolation scale used by the UK Biobank was 
constructed from three questions: (1) “Including yourself, 
how many people are living together in your household? 
Include those who usually live in the house such as 
students living away from home during term time, 
partners in the armed forces or professions such as pilots” 
(1 point for living alone); (2) “How often do you visit 
friends or family or have them visit you?” (1 point for 
friends and family visit less than once a month); and 
(3) “Which of the following [leisure/social activities] do 
you engage in once a week or more often? You may select 
more than one” (1 point for no participation in social 
activities at least weekly). Thus, individuals could score a 
total of 0–3; an individual was defined as socially isolated 
if he or she scored 2 or 3; those who scored 0 or 1 were 
classified as not isolated. Similar scales have been used 
previously in other UK studies.12
Loneliness was assessed with two questions: “Do you 
often feel lonely?” (no=0, yes=1) and “How often are you 
able to confide in someone close to you?” (0=almost daily 
to about once a month; 1=once every few months to never 
or almost never). An individual was defined as lonely if 
he or she scored 2, and not lonely if he or she scored 0 
or 1. Similar questions are included in scales such as the 
revised UCLA Loneliness Scale.13
Follow-up for all deaths irrespective of cause started at 
inclusion in the UK Biobank study (from national 
death registers) and ended on Aug 14, 2015, or upon 
death, for all participants. The cause-specific-mortality 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes 
were as follows: neoplasms (C00–D48), diseases of the 
circulatory system (I05–I89), and other diseases (all 
remaining ICD-10 codes).
Details of the assessments of participants’ variables are 
publicly available.14 Briefly, participants completed several 
touch-screen computer-based questionnaires, and then 
had a face-to-face interview with a trained researcher. 
The information collected included basic demographics 
(sex and age), ethnic origin (white vs other), socio-
economic factors (educational attainment, household 
income, and postcode of residence with the corresponding 
Townsend deprivation index score), and chronic diseases 
(diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other long-
standing illness, disability, or infirmity). The Townsend 
deprivation index is an integrated neighbourhood-level 
measure of unemploy 
ment, non-car ownership, non-
home ownership, and household overcrowding across 
the UK.15
To assess biological factors, trained data collectors 
measured height and weight in all participants during 
clinic attendance using standard operating procedures, 
and the body-mass index (BMI) was subsequently 
calculated. Procedures for measuring systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure and handgrip strength are 
reported in the UK Biobank protocol, which is available 
online.11 Behavioural factors, including cigarette smoking 
(current smoker [yes or no]; ex-smoker [yes or no]), 
physical activity (moderate and vigorous), and alcohol 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Social isolation and loneliness are associated with increased 
health problems and excess mortality risk. We searched PubMed 
for studies published in English up to May 31, 2016, using the 
following combinations of search terms (in title): (A) social 
support AND mortalit*; (B) social relations AND mortalit*; 
(C) social networks AND mortalit*; (D) social isolation AND 
mortalit*; and (E) loneliness AND mortalit*. Search combination 
A yielded 37 publications, B eight, C 14, D 11, and E 14. Findings 
from these studies suggest that there is an association between 
social isolation and mortality and between loneliness and 
mortality.
Added value of this study
Our study is, to our knowledge, the largest investigation into 
factors linking social isolation and loneliness to an increased 
mortality risk. We did a mediation analysis and found that 
the association between social isolation and mortality 
reduced by 64% after taking into account differences in 
lifestyle, socioeconomic factors, and mental health problems 
between socially isolated and non-isolated individuals. These 
risk factors explained the association between loneliness 
and mortality.
Implications of all the available evidence
Isolation and loneliness are markers of many risk factors, such 
as socioeconomic adversity, unhealthy lifestyles, and lowered 
mental wellbeing. Policies and public health interventions 
that tackle these risk factors in general could potentially 
reduce excess mortality among the isolated and the lonely.

intake frequency (at least three times a week vs twice a 
week or less) were self-reported on a questionnaire.
Psychological factors comprised current depressive 
symptoms and general cognitive capacity. Depressive 
symptoms were measured using the frequency of four 
items from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ):16,17 
(1) depressed mood, (2) disinterest or absence of 
enthusiasm, 
(3) 
tenseness 
or 
restlessness, 
and 
(4) tiredness or lethargy in the previous 2 weeks. General 
cognitive capacity (numeric memory, verbal–numerical 
reasoning, reaction time, and visual memory) was 
assessed by use of a touch-screen application.18 Self-rated 
health was assessed using the following question 
answered on a four-point scale (1=poor; 4=excellent): “In 
general, how would you rate your overall health?” 
Statistical analysis
We did analyses first using data from those participants 
who did not have any missing data (complete case 
analyses) and then using imputed datasets. We 
examined the associations of social isolation and 
loneliness 
with 
all-cause 
mortality 
using 
Cox 
proportional hazard models with age as a timescale. 
Associations 
with 
cause-specific 
mortality 
were 
examined using competing-risks survival regression 
(based on Fine and Gray’s proportional sub-hazards 
model), which is the appropriate method for estimation 
of competing actual risks.19 All the models were adjusted 
for age, sex, and ethnic origin, with additional 
adjustment for chronic disease. To measure the 
robustness of these associations, we did additional 
subgroup analyses separately for men and women, 
three age groups (37–52 years, 53–60 years, and 
61–73 years), different ethnic groups (white vs non-
white), and participants with and without chronic 
disease at baseline. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, 
ethnic origin, and chronic disease were chosen because 
these factors represent potential confounders for the 
association between social relations and mortality. Men, 
individuals belonging to ethnic minorities, elderly 
people, and those with long-standing illness tend to 
have fewer social relations and also are at increased risk 
of mortality.4,6 Similar three-level age categorisations 
have been used in a previous study based on UK 
Biobank data.20
To assess the extent to which baseline biological, 
behavioural, socioeconomic, psychological, and health-
related risk factors explained the associations of social 
isolation and loneliness with mortality, we calculated 
the percentage of excess risk mediated (PERM) for the 
following 
five 
groups 
of 
explanatory 
variables: 
(1) biological (BMI, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, 
and handgrip strength); (2) behavioural (smoking, alcohol 
consumption, and physical activity); (3) socioeconomic 
(Townsend deprivation index, education, and household 
income); (4) psychological factors (depressive symptoms 
and cognitive perfor 
mance); and (5) self-rated health. For 
each risk-factor group, we estimated the percentage of 
PERM as:21
Sex, ethnic origin, chronic disease, smoking status, 
education, and high alcohol consumption were treated as 
categorical and the other risk factors as continuous 
variables in the analyses. Finally, all the risk factors were 
included in the same model simultaneously (final 
model).
To assess the extent to which the associations followed 
a dose–response pattern, we did dose–response analyses 
using sum scores from the individual items of the 
isolation and loneliness measures. We analysed isolation 
and loneliness separately to assess whether there was a 
pattern across the continuous score as a predictor of 
mortality.
We accounted for missing data by multiple imputation 
by chained equations, which generated five imputed 
datasets.22 The imputation model included age, sex, social 
isolation, loneliness, all confounding and mediating 
variables, the Nelson-Aalen estimate of cumulative 
hazard, and survival status.23 We fitted Cox proportional 
hazards models within each imputed dataset and 
combined them in accordance with Rubin’s rules. 
To test whether reverse-causation bias (ie, the effect of 
chronic disease on social isolation) affected our results, 
we did a sensitivity analysis examining the association 
between social isolation and all-cause mortality (imputed 
data, but chronic disease missingness not imputed) after 
adjustment for all covariates in those without chronic 
disease at baseline. We used Stata (version 13.1) for all 
analyses.

Results
466 901 (93%) of the 502 656 individuals recruited to 
the UK Biobank provided complete data on social isolation, 
loneliness, and mortality, and were included in the present 
analysis. There were statistically significant differences in 
all the study variables between those who were and those 
who were not included, although the absolute between-
group differences were small (appendix p 2). The mean 
age of study participants was 56·5 years (SD 8·1;

disease, and risk factor adjusted)

range 40–69), 55% were women, and 95% were white 
(table). 42 548 (9%) of 466 901 participants were categorised 
as socially isolated and 29 442 (6%) as lonely.
During a mean follow-up of 6·5 years (SD 0·8) and 
3·0 million person-years at risk, 11 593 individuals died. 
The most common causes of death were neoplasms 
(6758 deaths) and diseases of the circulatory system 
(2032 deaths). Other causes (2803 deaths) included 
diseases of the respiratory and digestive systems and 
external causes. 
In the complete case analysis, the hazard ratio (adjusted 
for age, sex, ethnic origin, and chronic disease) for the risk 
of death from any cause among socially isolated people 
compared with their non-isolated counterparts was 
1·74 (95% CI 1·65–1·83). This association was consistent 
across sex and age groups, ethnic groups, and participants 
with and without chronic diseases at baseline, although 
it was weaker in women than in men (appendix p 6). 
The results of the cause-specific mortality analyses 
followed a similar pattern to those for all-cause mortality. 
Socially isolated individuals had an increased risk of death 
from 
neoplasms 
(minimally 
adjusted 
sub-hazard 
ratio 2·06, 95% CI 1·92–2·20), diseases of the circulatory 
system (1·68, 1·59–1·77), and other causes (1·57, 
1·48–1·66; figure 1).
In the multivariable analyses, the hazard ratio for social 
isolation compared with no social isolation was 
1·73 (95% CI 1·65–1·82) after adjustment for age, sex, 
ethnic origin, and chronic disease (ie, minimally 
adjusted), and decreased by 10% after adjustment for 
biological risk factors, 34% after adjustment for 
behavioural risk factors, 35% after adjustment for socio-
economic factors, 18% after adjustment for depressive 
symptoms, 
4% 
after 
adjustment 
for 
cognitive 
performance, and 32% after adjustment for self-rated 
health (figure 1). The overall attenuation after adjustment 
for all these factors (ie, fully adjusted) was 64% (hazard 
ratio 1·26, 95% CI 1·20–1·33). Similar patterns were 
found in all the cause-specific mortality groups.

factors (33–36%), and self-rated health (31–37%) were the 
strongest explanatory variables, but the fully adjusted 
sub-hazard ratios remained statistically significant and 
ranged from 1·32 to 1·22 (figure 1). 
In the complete case analysis, the minimally adjusted 
hazard ratio for the risk of death from any cause in lonely 
individuals compared with those who were not lonely 
was 1·37 (95% CI 1·28–1·46). This association was 
consistent across sex and age groups, ethnic groups, and 
participants with and without chronic disorders at 
baseline (appendix p 7). Lonely individuals had an 
increased risk of death from neoplasms (minimally 
adjusted sub-hazard ratio 1·75, 95% CI 1·61–1·91), 
diseases of the circulatory system (1·30, 1·23–1·39), and 
other causes (1·24, 1·15–1·34; figure 2). Serial 
adjustments led to complete attenuation of the association 
(fully adjusted hazard ratio 0·99, 95% CI 0·93–1·06; 
figure 2). A similar pattern emerged in all the cause-
specific mortality groups. Depressive symptoms (PERM 
60–77%) and self-rated health (61–84%) seemed to be the 
strongest mediators, in addition to socioeconomic 
(41–50%) and behavioural factors (32–53%; figure 2).

Social isolation and loneliness were associated with 
higher levels of depressive symptoms, smoking, and high 
alcohol intake frequency, all of which are well established 
correlates of social isolation and loneliness (appendix p 3).
The multivariable, minimally adjusted complete-case 
analysis showed similar associations between all-cause 
mortality and social isolation (hazard ratio 1·29, 95% CI 
1·14–1·47) and loneliness (0·93, 0·77–1·11). 
The dose–response analyses revealed a dose–response 
pattern in the associations of social isolation and 
loneliness with all-cause mortality (appendix p 5). When 
both isolation and loneliness were tested in the same 
model, only social isolation predicted all-cause mortality 
(hazard ratio 1·27, 95% CI 1·20–1·33).
In the sensitivity analysis testing for reverse-causation 
bias, the association between social isolation and all-
cause mortality was still apparent (hazard ratio 1·22, 
95% CI 1·08–1·38). The frequencies of complete and 
imputed variables are reported in the appendix (p 4; 
imputed data sample size 499 238).
Discussion
In this UK Biobank study, social isolation was associated 
with increased mortality in the total cohort as well as in 
the subgroups of men and women, younger and older 
individuals, initially healthy and unhealthy people, and 
ethnic subgroups. We also found a similar relation for 
cause-specific 
mortality, 
including 
deaths 
from 
neoplasms and diseases of the circulatory system. Risk 
factors explained 64% of the association between social 
isolation and mortality, leaving over a third independent 
of socioeconomic factors, health-related behaviours, 
depressive symptoms, biological factors, and cognitive 
capacity. Loneliness was also associated with increased 
mortality, but, unlike social isolation, differences in risk-
factor levels, especially depressive symptoms, between 
lonely individuals and others explained its association 
with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study 
on the contribution of biological, behavioural, socio-
economic, and psychological risk factors to associations 
between social isolation and all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality. Our research complements findings from 
meta-analyses,3–5 which reported an association between 
social isolation and increased all-cause mortality. The 
novel aspects in our analysis include the identification 
of explanatory factors with greater precision than 
previously, and the fact that we examined not only all-
cause mortality, but also deaths from neoplasms and 
circulatory diseases.4 The strength of the social isolation–
mortality association broadly reflected what has been 
previously reported, with a hazard ratio of 1·73 in the 
present study compared with 1·3 in previous meta-
analyses.3–5 This similarity was also the case for 
loneliness, with a hazard ratio of 1·38 in the present 
study compared with a minimally adjusted relative risk 
of 1·3 in a previous meta-analysis.4 However, unlike in 
some previous studies, our findings suggest that the 
association between loneliness and mortality is fully 
attributable to the worse risk-factor levels in the exposed 
group. Of the risk factors, increased depressive 
symptoms explained 66% and socioeconomic factors 
44% of the excess mortality in lonely individuals. This 
result broadly confirms the less precise estimates 
reported in a smaller study in elderly people.24
Findings from previous studies3,4 have suggested that 
socioeconomic factors explain part of the association 
between social isolation and disease. In support of these 
findings, we show that 35% of the relation between 
mortality and social isolation was attributable to 
education, neighbourhood deprivation, and household 
income (ie, socioeconomic factors). With regard to 
loneliness, the contribution of socioeconomic factors 
was 44%. Contrary to previous findings,6 the present 
results do not imply that biological factors (eg, obesity, 
high diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and low 
handgrip strength) are major contributing factors. 
However, because our analyses were adjusted for 
prevalent chronic diseases at baseline, the estimated 
contribution of biological risk factors did not include 
variation in these diseases.
The association between mortality and social isolation 
seemed stronger than the association between mortality 
and loneliness. These two factors measure different 
aspects of social relations and thus also have slightly 
different associations with health outcomes and 
mortality. Whereas isolation measures the scarcity of 
contact with other people and related health resources, 
loneliness is a perception of detachment associated 
potentially with emotional states such as depressive 
symptoms. People can feel lonely even if they are 
married or living with someone, and that feeling might 
be less closely related to an absence of practical support 
than to actual isolation.25
Some methodological issues should be taken into 
account when interpreting our findings. Studies in this 
specialty have typically relied on small samples that are 
vulnerable to chance findings. Meta-analyses of these 
studies are additionally limited by heterogeneity in 
study populations, the diversity of measures used, and 
differences in the levels of statistical adjustment. 
The UK Biobank provided an opportunity to investigate 
the associations of social isolation and loneliness with 
mortality and their links to risk factors in a large sample, 
substantially reducing the risk of random error. 
However, the response rate was low, and selection bias 
should be taken into account especially when making 
inferences 
about 
population 
prevalence 
figures. 
However, prevalence and incidence were not the focus 
of the present study. We used a multi-item assessment 
of social isolation, which is referred to in previous 
studies as the best predictive validity for such a 
measurement strategy in relation to mortality.4

measurement (structural and functional) might better 
capture the many effects of social relationships.5,26
We measured only simple forms of the complex 
phenomenon of social networks and interaction, although 
similar results have been reported in studies using more 
advanced network analysis.27 Missing data on the 
covariates reduced the sample size at each successive 
stage of the regression model adjustment, although the 
results were similar when the analyses were repeated with 
only participants who provided complete data on all the 
variables. The possibility of residual confounding cannot 
be completely ruled out in observational studies such as 
ours, although the association between social isolation 
and mortality remained even after adjustment for a wide 
range of potential confounders. Similarly, reverse causality 
can affect the results of observational research. For 
example, in our study, chronic disease might have affected 
the risk of both social isolation and mortality. However, we 
noted an association between social isolation and mortality 
even among those with no prevalent chronic disease at 
baseline and after adjustment for a range of health-related 
covariates. Finally, the sample comprised participants 
aged between 40 years and 69 years; hence, the findings 
cannot be extrapolated beyond this age range.
In conclusion, data from the UK Biobank suggest that 
social isolation is associated with overall excess mortality 
and death attributable to neoplasms and circulatory 
diseases. Most of the excess mortality among socially 
isolated and lonely people could be attributed to adverse 
socioeconomic conditions, an unhealthy lifestyle, and 
lower mental wellbeing. Public health policies addressing 
these issues might reduce this excess. Such policies have 
been designed to increase longevity in the general 
population. The results of the present study suggest that 
isolated and lonely people in particular would benefit 
from successful implementation of targeted policies. 
Future studies should assess the potential benefits, 
harms, and cost-effectiveness of interventions and 
policies aimed at tackling risk factors in lonely and 
isolated people.
