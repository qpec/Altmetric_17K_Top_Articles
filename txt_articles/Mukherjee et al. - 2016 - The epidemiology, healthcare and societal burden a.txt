Abstract
Background: There are a lack of reliable data on the epidemiology and associated burden and costs of asthma. We
sought to provide the first UK-wide estimates of the epidemiology, healthcare utilisation and costs of asthma.
Methods: We obtained and analysed asthma-relevant data from 27 datasets: these comprised national health
surveys for 2010–11, and routine administrative, health and social care datasets for 2011–12; 2011–12 costs were
estimated in pounds sterling using economic modelling.
Results: The prevalence of asthma depended on the definition and data source used. The UK lifetime prevalence
of patient-reported symptoms suggestive of asthma was 29.5 % (95 % CI, 27.7–31.3; n = 18.5 million (m) people)
and 15.6 % (14.3–16.9, n = 9.8 m) for patient-reported clinician-diagnosed asthma. The annual prevalence of patient-
reported clinician-diagnosed-and-treated asthma was 9.6 % (8.9–10.3, n = 6.0 m) and of clinician-reported,
diagnosed-and-treated asthma 5.7 % (5.7–5.7; n = 3.6 m). Asthma resulted in at least 6.3 m primary care
consultations, 93,000 hospital in-patient episodes, 1800 intensive-care unit episodes and 36,800 disability living
allowance claims. The costs of asthma were estimated at least £1.1 billion: 74 % of these costs were for provision of
primary care services (60 % prescribing, 14 % consultations), 13 % for disability claims, and 12 % for hospital care.
There were 1160 asthma deaths.
Conclusions: Asthma is very common and is responsible for considerable morbidity, healthcare utilisation and
financial costs to the UK public sector. Greater policy focus on primary care provision is needed to reduce the risk
of asthma exacerbations, hospitalisations and deaths, and reduce costs.

 Background
Asthma is now one of the most common long-term con-
ditions in the world [1, 2]. Our previous related work,
commissioned to inform United Kingdom (UK) and
Scottish parliamentary reviews of allergy services, dem-
onstrated that the UK had amongst the highest preva-
lence of allergy and asthma in the world [2–4]. This
work was important in influencing a range of national
policy developments, but is now dated. Given that
asthma was highlighted as the major contributor to the
estimated burden and costs, there is a particular need
for a more up-to-date and detailed review of the burden,
healthcare utilisation and costs, and outcomes of asthma
[5]. This need was underscored by the recent National
Review of Asthma Deaths, which concluded that “46 %
of asthma deaths could have been avoided with better
routine care” [6].
In undertaking the present study, we sought to over-
come important limitations of our previous studies [2–4]
by extending the scope from healthcare costs alone to in-
clude wider societal costs and by incorporating data from
previously unavailable datasets; these included out-of-
hours care, ambulance, accident and emergency (A&E),
intensive care unit (ICU) utilisation, and disability living
allowance (DLA) data.
In this paper, we describe the overall epidemiology,
healthcare utilisation and costs of asthma for the UK as
a whole and, for the first time, its member countries (i.e.
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland).
Methods
Overview of methods
Our methods have been described in detail in our pub-
lished protocol [7].
We undertook secondary analyses of national health
surveys, primary and secondary National Health Service
(NHS) datasets, and national administrative data. In in-
stances where relevant data were unavailable from a sin-
gle source, datasets were linked. Overall, we analysed
data from 27 datasets, of which five were linked. The
data sources used to measure the study outcomes for
each country are shown in Table 1. We analysed and re-
ported the findings for 2011–12, or where this was not
available, for 2010–11. The base year used for all costs
was the 2011–12 financial year, applying appropriate in-
flation indices where required [8].
Study population
The denominator for each dataset was based on the total
sample of people in the dataset or the mid-year popula-
tion estimate of the country where the dataset covered
the entire population. The mid-year UK population esti-
mates were 62,759,456 in 2010–11 and 63,285,100 in
2011–12 [9, 10].
Study outcomes
Depending on the dataset, patients with asthma were de-
fined as follows:
1) Being diagnosed with asthma in primary care based on
relevant Read codes (Additional file 1: Appendix 1) [7]
2) Respondents in national health surveys who
reported symptoms or treatment suggestive of
asthma or reported clinician-diagnosed asthma [7]
3) Having received asthma medications prescribed by
their general practitioner (GP) for asthma, where
prescriptions were coded using British National
Formulary (BNF) codes (Additional file 1: Appendix
2) [7, 11]
4) Using NHS out-patient clinic, out-of-hours service,
ambulance service or A&E for asthma
5) Having a primary diagnosis of asthma with ICD-10
code of J45 for asthma or J46 for status asthmaticus
at discharge from hospital [7, 12]
6) Having a primary diagnosis of asthma at admission
with Read codes (Additional file 1: Appendix 3) in
paediatric ICU and ICD-10 codes J45 or J46 or
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
(APACHE) III diagnostic code for asthma in adult
ICUs [7, 13]
7) Having ICD-10 codes J45 or J46 for asthma as the
main disabling condition for claiming DLA or as the
underlying cause of death at registration [12, 14]
Thus patients or events where the main reason for
healthcare or societal care utilisation was asthma were
all included. This criterion thus (1) includes patients
with asthma who might have had comorbidities, but
only their asthma was accounted for and not their co-
morbidities, (2) does not include patients where asthma
was not the main diagnosis.
Outcome measures and datasets used
The data sources used in the respective countries to as-
sess the outcome measures along with availability of
demographic information used and time trend by UK
nations is presented in Table 1.
Incidence
Our primary aim was to measure healthcare utilisation;
therefore, our focus was to estimate asthma incident-
spells that generated a contact with primary care (see
description for England below). Secondarily, where pos-
sible, we also estimated the incidence of first occurrence
of asthma (incident cases) (see description for Scotland
and Wales below). However, considering that an asthma
episode may present in secondary care and that most
UK primary and secondary care data are not linked, it
was challenging to identify with certainty if an asthma

 episode presenting in secondary care represented the
first occurrence of the asthma case. Due to differences
among data sources and reporting, we used two mea-
sures of incidence, namely (1) clinician-reported mean
weekly incident spells of asthma and (2) clinician-
reported onset of asthma. In England, weekly incidence
of asthma episodes was estimated from averaging new
weekly episodes recorded by the Weekly Returns Service
(WRS) of the Royal College of General Practitioners
[15]. WRS receives notifications of weekly episodes and
numbers of consultations for asthma using ICD-9 code
493, from about 90 general practices covering over
800,000 people in England. WRS episodes are available
by age-groups and sex for each quarter and year.
In Scotland, Practice Team Information (PTI) was
used to measure onset of asthma resulting in new GP
consultation [16]. PTI is a GP-database comprising a
sample of 60 general practices representing about 6 % of
Scottish general practices and around 6 % of the Scottish
patient population. It includes GP and nurse consulta-
tions and diagnoses using Read codes, along with demo-
graphic data. PTI was established in 2003–04 and we
used this year as the starting point of follow-up for
5 years. Onset of asthma was defined as new GP consult-
ation in patients who were consistently in PTI since
2003–04 and did not consult their GP for asthma for
those 5 years, but consulted their GP for asthma after
2008–09. This assumes that patients who consulted their
GP for asthma before 2003 would come to see their GP
at least once in those 5 years. Following this method,
only new consultations which had a Read code for
asthma in 2011–12 were counted.
In Wales, onset of asthma resulting in new GP consult-
ation was estimated from the Secure Anonymised Infor-
mation Linkage (SAIL) databank, which during the study
period collected data from 42 % of the GP practices in
Wales [17]. There were data available on demographics
and diagnoses based on Read codes (Additional file 1:
Appendix 1). Only patients who had not deregistered from
the participating GP practices and did not consult a GP
for asthma between 2006–07 and 2010–11 and had new
consultations with Read code for asthma (Additional file
1: Appendix 1) in 2011–12 were counted.
We could not identify any GP-database in Northern
Ireland that could be used to estimate annual onset of
asthma by new GP consultation within the available
budget for this work.
Prevalence
We defined annual prevalence as the proportion of the
population who experienced symptoms of asthma at
least once during the study year and life prevalence as
the proportion of the population who experienced symp-
toms of asthma for at least part of their lives at any time
during their life course [18]. Besides using lifetime and
annual prevalence, we distinguished between patient-
reported and clinician-reported measures, when the data
pertained to health surveys and primary care data re-
corded by GPs, respectively. Thus, we used seven mea-
sures of prevalence, of which (1) lifetime prevalence of
patient-reported symptoms suggestive of asthma, (2) an-
nual prevalence of patient-reported symptoms suggestive
of asthma, (3) lifetime prevalence of patient-reported
clinician-diagnosed asthma, (4) annual prevalence of pa-
tient-reported clinician-diagnosed symptomatic asthma,
and (5) annual prevalence of patient-reported clinician-
diagnosed-and-treated asthma were based on national
health surveys and (6) annual prevalence of clinician-
reported-and-diagnosed asthma and (7) annual prevalence
of clinician-reported-diagnosed-and-treated asthma were
based on primary care data. The health surveys used were
the Health Survey for England (HSE) [19], Scottish Health
Survey (SHeS) [20], Welsh Health Survey (WHS) [21] and
Northern Ireland Health Survey [22]. These surveys were
of randomly selected samples of people broadly represen-
tative of their respective general populations. They in-
cluded information on self-reported health and utilisation
of health services. While the questions for asthma in
the national health surveys were similar in England
and Scotland, in Wales, only one question was asked
questioning whether the respondent had been treated
for asthma in that year [23]. Thus, only annual preva-
lence
of
patient-reported
clinician-diagnosed-and-
treated asthma could be estimated for Wales using
the national health survey. Northern Ireland Health
Survey asthma data were mainly on adult respon-
dents, since information on children of ages between
2 and 14 years were grouped together. We thus could
not use this information on children on age standard-
isation and hence national estimates could not be
ascertained for Northern Ireland using national health
survey data [23].
The prevalence estimates from primary care databases
came from WRS in England [15], PTI in Scotland [16]
and
SAIL-GP
in
Wales
[17],
all
of
which
had
individual-level data. Additional estimates came from
the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) data,
which was the only data source available from all four UK
nations [24–27]; this was, however, aggregated at GP prac-
tice level, so could not provide a breakdown by age and
sex [7]. QOF data pertaining to asthma (which is one of
the many indicators) are a count of all people of all ages
with asthma registered with GP practices, excluding
patients with asthma who were not prescribed asthma-
related drugs in the last 12 months (Quality Improvement
code Asthma 1) [28]. We were unable to identify any suit-
able primary care data source from Northern Ireland
within our budget.

 The definitions for the prevalence measures used were:
1) Lifetime prevalence of patient-reported symptoms
suggestive of asthma – defined as the number of
people who had responded yes to “Have you had
wheezing or whistling in the chest at any time,
either now/in the past?” in HSE for England or in
SHeS for Scotland, divided by the number of
respondents who had answered that question in
HSE or SHeS for England and Scotland, respectively.
2) Annual prevalence of patient-reported symptoms
suggestive of asthma – defined as the number of
people who had responded yes to “Have you had
wheezing or whistling in the chest in the last
12 months?” in HSE for England or in SHeS for
Scotland, divided by the number of respondents who
had answered that question in HSE or SHeS, for
England and Scotland, respectively.
3) Lifetime prevalence of patient-reported clinician-
diagnosed asthma – for England, defined as the
number of people who had responded yes to “Did a
doctor or nurse ever tell you that you had asthma?”
in HSE divided by the number of respondents who
had answered that question, and for Scotland “Did a
doctor ever tell you that you had asthma?” in SHeS,
divided by the number of respondents who had
answered that question.
4) Annual prevalence of patient-reported clinician-
diagnosed symptomatic asthma – for England,
defined as the number of people who had responded
yes to both the questions “Have you had wheezing
or whistling in the chest in the last 12 months?”
and “Did a doctor or nurse ever tell you that you
had asthma?” in HSE, divided by the number of
respondents who had answered the former question.
For Scotland, the number of people who had
responded yes to both the questions “Have you had
wheezing or whistling in the chest in the last
12 months?” and “Did a doctor ever tell you that
you had asthma?” in SHeS, divided by the number of
respondents who had answered the former question.
5) Annual prevalence of patient-reported clinician-
diagnosed-and-treated asthma – defined as the
number of people who had responded yes to both
the questions “Did a doctor or nurse ever tell you
that you had asthma?” and “Over the last 12 months,
have you used an inhaler/puffer/nebuliser prescribed
by a doctor to treat your asthma/wheezing/whistling/
difficulty in breathing?” in HSE, divided by the
number of respondents who had answered the latter
question for England. For Scotland, the number of
people who had responded yes to both the questions
“Did a doctor ever tell you that you had asthma?” and
“Were you treated in the past 12 months for wheeze
by GP/nurse at surgery/community/school/district
nurse/hospital, consultant/specialist at hospital,
consultant/specialist elsewhere, homeopath/
acupuncturist/other alternative medicine professional”
in SHeS, divided by the number of respondents who
had answered the latter question. For Wales, the only
available question used was “are you currently being
treated for asthma” in WHS, with the numerator as
the number of respondents who said yes to that and
the denominator as the total number of respondents
to that question.
6) Annual prevalence of clinician-reported-and-diagnosed
asthma – based on PTI’s Read code grouping ‘asthma’
(Additional file 1: Appendix 1) and obtained from 39
practices participating in PTI in 2011–12 who had
submitted complete GP and practice-nurse data in
Scotland and from the GP practices that participated in
SAIL-GP in Wales in 2011–12. PTI data were broadly
representative of the Scottish population, and so is the
population covered by the GP practices representing
the Welsh population, thus these estimates are
generalizable for Scotland and Wales.
7) Annual prevalence of clinician-reported-diagnosed-
and-treated asthma – defined as the proportion of
people of all ages who were prescribed asthma-
related drugs by GPs for their symptoms of asthma
in the last 12 months (Quality Improvement code
Asthma 1) [28], compared to the population size
the GP practice covered in that year (the list size).
Since age and sex are not available in QOF, age
standardised rate could not be reported and thus
only crude rates are presented.
Healthcare utilisation in primary care
GP and nurse consultation
For estimating GP and nurse consultations for asthma,
WRS was used for England, PTI for Scotland and SAIL-
GP for Wales. WRS had ICD-9 codes, PTI and SAIL-GP
had Read codes (Additional file 1: Appendix 1).
Prescriptions
Community prescriptions for asthma were identified
from the SAIL-GP database based on our list of BNF
codes (Additional file 1: Appendix 2) [7]. Some medica-
tions indicated for use in asthma can also be prescribed
to treat other conditions, primarily chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). We therefore confined our
analysis of medications to people with a clinician-
recorded diagnosis of asthma, but without a diagnosis of
COPD [7]. To address this issue, medications of patients
who had COPD and asthma were included so long as
they received the list of asthma medication we had
(Additional file 1: Appendix 2), but patients with COPD
but no asthma were excluded.
Mukherjee et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:113 
Page 5 of 15
 For comparison, the total cost of all medications used
for asthma (excluding immunosuppressants, which are
also used for other conditions) was also examined in
Prescription Costs Analysis (PCA) data for each of the
four countries [29–32]. It should be noted that, because
PCA data did not include information on diagnosis,
these data included medications with an indication for
asthma, but which were prescribed for other conditions.
In pre-specified sensitivity analyses, community pre-
scribing costs for Scottish patients under the age of 40
(in whom COPD is rare), extracted from Scottish Pre-
scribing Information Systems (PIS) data, were compared
to the figures extrapolated from the SAIL-GP results to
test the reliability of the extrapolation process.
Out-of-hours
Information on calls to an out-of-hours NHS service
were only obtainable from NHS 24 Scotland, the na-
tional telephone triage and advice service [33]. Data are
available from 2008 onwards. All calls where the nurse
triaging the out-of-hours call selected an asthma-specific
algorithm to support their decision-making were col-
lected. In England, although an out-of-hours surveillance
team exists, a breakdown by asthma was not available.
The out-of-hours data in Wales were inconsistently col-
lected across areas and hence were not used. We could
get out-of-hours data on asthma for Northern Ireland.
Healthcare utilisation in secondary care
Out-patient attendances
Although routine data on attendances in NHS out-
patient clinics were available across the four nations,
these data were, however, captured under the broader
heading of ‘respiratory’ consultations and it was there-
fore not possible to estimate the proportions of these
consultations that were particularly for asthma. This is
noted as a major data gap.
Ambulance services
For Scotland, asthma data from the Scottish Ambulance
Service, which had data from 2008–09 onwards, were
used where the record had “Emergency call-asthma se-
lected” [34]. Usage of ambulance service due to asthma
could not reliably be estimated from the aggregated rou-
tinely collected data available in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland; this is therefore identified as a data gap.
A&E services
In England, there were no accurate published data on
A&E attendances for asthma. In Scotland, the A&E data
mart was used for sites which reported (excluding Orkney
and Tayside Health Boards, since they currently only sub-
mit high level diagnosis codes to ISD) patient-level infor-
mation from their A&E departments since 2010–11 [35].
The data reported here are from ‘new’ and ‘unplanned re-
turn’ attendances at A&E, i.e. excluding those who were
‘recall’ or ‘planned return’. If the ‘disease code’ included
the ICD-10 codes above or ‘R062’ (Family history of
asthma) or if the ‘presenting complaint text’ or ‘diagnosis
text’ referred to any of the terms asthma, wheezing, low
saturation, chest tightness or shortness of breath, then
those cases were selected. In Wales, the SAIL Emergency
Department Dataset, which contains data since 2009, were
used [36]. There was an audit data in Northern Ireland on
A&E in one of its Trusts, namely Belfast Health and Social
Care Trust, which collected data from 2007–08 onwards.
Since that data from one urban Trust may not have been
representative of the entire nation, we did not use these
for our national estimates.
Inpatient and day cases in hospitals
We queried the Hospital Episode Statistics for England
[37], General/Acute Inpatient and Day Case dataset for
Scotland [38], SAIL Patient Episode Database for Wales
[39], and Hospital Inpatient System dataset in Northern
Ireland [40], for primary diagnosis of asthma with ICD-10
codes to identify all asthma episodes. However, hospital-
based prescribing was not included in these datasets.
ICUs
The Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICA
Net) is a national audit which collects data on all critic-
ally ill children admitted to paediatric ICUs across the
UK [41]. It had data from England and Wales from
2002, from Scotland from 2007, and from Northern
Ireland from 2008 onwards, recorded in Read version 3
(Additional file 1: Appendix 3). For adults in ICUs, for
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, we used Intensive
Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) data,
which have been collected since 1996 and which uses
ICD-10 codes [42]. For Scotland, the Scottish Intensive
Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG) data were queried
and APACHE III diagnoses for asthma was used [13, 43].
For all of these countries, data from stand-alone ICUs or
from ICUs mixed with high dependency units were in-
cluded. Data from stand-alone high dependency units
were excluded.
Wider societal impact
To capture impact beyond the health services, we investi-
gated absenteeism in school and at work, care-at-home,
DLA and mortality.
Absenteeism
School and work absenteeism data were obtained from
HSE 2010 for England, from the questions “Over the last
12 months, how many days has your asthma/wheezing/
whistling in (your/his/her) chest caused (you/him/her)
Mukherjee et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:113 
Page 6 of 15
 to be absent from school?” and “Over the last 12 months,
how many days has your wheezing/whistling in your
chest, shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing caused
you to be absent from work?”, respectively, among asthma
respondents. We could not identify any suitable data
source to investigate school and work absenteeism in
Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Since HSE reports
absence as a categorical variable: < 5 days, 5–9, etc., we
used mid-points to estimate the number of days. The esti-
mates produced were for the number of days of absence
as a proportion of the sample population, so the rates
were of number of days of absence per 1000 population.
Care-at-home
We were unable to identify any suitable data to estimate
costs of care at home for asthma from any nation.
DLA
Aggregated data were available from the Department of
Work and Pensions (DWP) [14], the government agency
providing national benefits on number of people receiv-
ing DLA and DLA amount, with asthma as the main
disabling condition in England, Scotland and Wales for
2011–12. For Northern Ireland, there were data available
from the Department for Communities on number of
people receiving DLA due to asthma as the main disab-
ling condition and total amount by age-group, sex and
SES from 2008 [44].
Premature retirement
We could not identify a data source for this outcome
and therefore identified this as a data gap.
Mortality
Mortality data with underlying cause of death as asthma
from death certificate registrations, coded using ICD-10,
are available from the Office of National Statistics for
England and Wales [45], National Records Scotland [46],
and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency for
Northern Ireland [47] were queried.
Analyses
Counts of events or people, as the case was, were ob-
tained across all the age-groups (<5, 5–9, 10–14, … 70–
74, > 75 years) (except QOF) for that year, along with
the denominator. For comparison across nations, figures
obtained across the datasets were age standardised using
the European Standard Population (Version 2013) [48].
Age-standardised epidemiological, healthcare utilisation,
school and work absenteeism and DLA estimates, ac-
companied by their respective 95 % confidence inter-
vals
(CIs)
were
reported
based
on
the
Poisson
approximation [49]. UK-wide summaries of incidence
and prevalence estimates and associated 95 % CIs
were calculated by inverse variance, fixed effect meta-
analyses in R (Version 3.1.0).
Healthcare costs were estimated from a NHS perspec-
tive based on healthcare utilisation using NHS data, de-
tailed in Additional file 1: Appendix 4. Where a given
dataset did not include a direct measure of costs, stand-
ard UK price weights were applied to generate cost esti-
mates for each form of healthcare [8, 11, 50]. Additional
file 1: Appendix 4 summarises the costing method ap-
plied in each case. Primary care price weights were taken
from the Personal and Social Services Research Unit.
Community prescribing costs were based on net ingredi-
ent costs based on SAIL-GP prescribing for asthma medi-
cations in non-COPD patients [11, 17]. These data
contained details of the type and date of medication pre-
scribed, but not the number of items prescribed on a given
date. Therefore, a conservative assumption that a single
pack was prescribed at each time had to be applied, which
underestimated the costs associated with prescriptions for
multiple items. Inpatient care costs were based on NHS
Reference Cost estimates based on their associated
Healthcare Resource Grouping (Version 4) [50].
Societal costs were estimated from a wider societal
perspective, including NHS costs as above and DLA.
Though we originally aimed to include productivity
costs, it was not possible to reliably estimate costs
due to school and work absenteeism since the data
were not asthma specific and excluded some key
variables.
Addressing data gaps for cost analysis
Data gaps found were of three forms: (1) within country,
where no single dataset in a given country held sufficient
variables to provide an estimate, but linkages between
datasets could overcome this; (2) between countries,
where data on the variable of interest (after allowing for
linkages) were available in one member country, but not
in another; and (3) across countries, where no data (after
allowing for linkages) from any member country were
found for the variables of interest.
For type (1) data gaps, linked data were used. For type (2)
data gaps, estimates of a given variable from one country,
where available (e.g. prescription costs in Wales), were
mapped onto other countries, adjusting for population size,
annual
prevalence
of
clinician-reported-diagnosed-and-
treated asthma (QOF), which was available across all the
nations, and the age and sex distribution of patients who
reported having asthma in the respective country’s health
survey, or in the SAIL-GP database (Additional file 1:
Appendix 5). For type (3) data gaps, a literature search was
undertaken in an attempt to provide parameter estimates
for modelling (although no usable data-fitting modelling re-
quirements were found).

 Economic modelling
An economic model of the costs of asthma in the UK and
its member countries was built in Excel 2010 (Additional
file 1: Appendix 6). In brief, data on resource use were
taken directly from healthcare utilisation data based on
the internal diagnostic coding (such as Read code or ICD-
10) available in each dataset. For factors such as hospital
episodes and DLA, whole population datasets were avail-
able and complete, thus not requiring any adjustment.
The model applied the price weights detailed above to
generate costs from this resource use [8, 11, 50]. Costs
based on a sample within a country were extrapolated to
population levels by rescaling per head of age-sex strati-
fied population. Where results were extrapolated to an-
other country due to data gaps, additional rescaling was
undertaken based on each country’s relative QOF preva-
lence, in order to account for differences in prevalence
rates between countries [25–28]. QOF was selected for
this process due to its relationship to treated asthma,
which provided the most appropriate data source for
healthcare utilisation and was the only measure of preva-
lence measured in a uniform manner in all countries. The
model was also used to sum the cost estimates into any
required groupings; bootstrapping (with 10,000 replicates)
was used to estimate 95 % CIs around the joint distribu-
tions of each total cost estimate using the percentile
method (Additional file 1: Appendix 6) [51]. Following
recommendations in standard modelling guidance [52],
the uncertainty around prevalence estimates were simu-
lated using a beta distribution and uncertainty around cost
estimates were simulated using a gamma distribution or a
normal distribution where sample sizes were large and
central limit theorem was expected to hold (Additional file
1: Appendix 6).
Results
The data below refer to UK-wide estimates unless other-
wise stated.
Incidence
We estimated that the annual age-standardised incidence
of GP-diagnosed asthma was 3.8/1000 (95 % CI, 3.8–3.9),
equivalent to approximately 240,000 people in the UK de-
veloping asthma in 2011–12. On average, there were 5600
weekly incident GP episodes of asthma (Table 2).
Prevalence
The lifetime prevalence of patient-reported symptoms sug-
gestive of asthma was 29.5 % (95 % CI, 27.7–31.3), equiva-
lent to 18.5 m people. The annual prevalence of patient-
reported symptoms suggestive of asthma was 17.1 % (95 %
CI, 15.7–18.5), equivalent to 10.7 m people (Table 2).
The lifetime prevalence of patient-reported clinician-
diagnosed asthma was 15.6 % (95 % CI, 14.3–16.9),
equivalent to 9.8 m people; annual prevalence of patient-
reported clinician-diagnosed symptomatic asthma was
8.1 % (95 % CI, 7.2–9.1), which equated to 5.1 m people;
annual prevalence of patient-reported clinician-diagnosed-
and-treated asthma was 9.6 % (95 % CI, 8.9-10.3), which
equated
to
6.0
m
people;
annual
prevalence
of
clinician-reported-and-diagnosed asthma was 5.7 %
(95 % CI, 5.7–5.7), which equated to 3.6 m people;
clinician-reported-diagnosed-and-treated asthma was 6.8 %
(95 % CI, 6.8–6.8), which equated to 4.3 m people.
Healthcare utilisation in primary care
There were an estimated 2.7 m (95 % CI, 2.6–3.0) GP
consultations, 3.7 m (95 % CI, 3.6–4.1) nurse consulta-
tions and 54,000 (95 % CI, 53,000–60,000) out-of-hours
calls for asthma (Table 3).
Healthcare utilisation in secondary care
There were an estimated 113,000 (95 % CI, 108,000–
132,000) ambulance conveyances for asthma; 121,000 (95 %
CI, 108,000–146,000) A&E attendances; 93,900 (95 % CI,
93,900–93,900) in-patient episodes; 6100 (95 % CI, 5900–
6200) day-case episodes; and 1800 (95 % CI, 1700–1900)
ICU episodes (Table 4). The total length of stay for inpa-
tients and day-cases in UK relating to asthma was
195,000 days.
Wider societal impact
School absenteeism for asthma or asthma symptoms
accounted for 252.4 days/1000 children (95 % CI, 241.3–
263.5; n/N = 1267/5352), equivalent to 2.8 m (95 % CI,
2.6–3.0) absences. Work absenteeism for asthma symp-
toms accounted for 78.9 days/1000 adults (95 % CI,
72.6–85.3, n/N = 535/6978), equivalent to 4.1 m (95 %
CI, 3.4–4.7) work-days lost.
For asthma, DLA was claimed by an estimated 36,980
people; 24,100 people in England, 3600 people in
Scotland, 3300 people in Wales and 5980 people in
Northern Ireland.
There were an estimated 1160 deaths (2.1/100,000;
95 % CI, 2.0–2.2) due to asthma; 982 deaths in England
(2.1/100,000; 95 % CI, 2.0–2.2), 94 in Scotland (2.0/
100,000; 95 % CI, 1.6–2.3), 58 in Wales (2.0/100,000;
95 % CI, 1.5–2.5), and 26 in Northern Ireland (1.9/
100,000; 95 % CI, 1.2–2.7).
Financial costs of asthma
We estimated that asthma cost at least £1.1 bn with the
majority of costs (74 %) arising in primary care, of which
81 % were for community prescribing. Table 5 provides a
detailed breakdown of this estimate by member countries
and cost elements. For comparison, the total cost of all
medications listed in PCA data with an indication for use
in asthma (irrespective of condition actually prescribed

which £821.2 m, £97.5 m, £66.1 m and £38.7 m were in-
curred in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,
respectively. It is important to note that the parity be-
tween the £1.1 bn total cost estimate from our model and
the £1.1 bn total cost of medications with an indication
for asthma from PCA data is entirely co-incidental and
occurs due to PCA providing an overestimate of medica-
tion costs in this context, rather than being a component
of the costs used in the model.

ing costs for Scottish patients under the age of 40 years
from PIS data to the costs estimated for the same group

 reported in Wales, sensitivity analysis which extrapolated
all inpatient episode costs from the Welsh results raised
the estimate to £147.0 m, i.e. approximately 70 % higher
than the base case. Figures extrapolated from each of
the other countries to Wales on the other hand ranged
from £5.0 m to £5.5 m, or approximately 32–38 % lower
(Additional file 1: Appendix 7).
Discussion
We found that the prevalence of asthma varied widely
depending on the definition used, ranging from 29.5 %
(18.5 m people) for lifetime symptoms suggestive of
asthma to 5.7 % (3.6 m) for those with active, clinician-
diagnosed-and-treated asthma. Considerable care there-
fore needs to be taken in defining the populations being
discussed and consistent use of the seven different defi-
nitions proposed in this paper should help greatly in this
respect. We also found that, even with conservative as-
sumptions, there was considerable morbidity, healthcare
utilisation and costs such that asthma now costs the UK
public sector well in excess of £1.1 bn per annum. The
overwhelming majority of these costs are incurred in re-
lation to prescribing in primary care for preventive treat-
ments, but despite this, there were almost 100,000
inpatient episodes for asthma and over 1000 asthma
deaths. These data suggest that particular focus is war-
ranted on primary care to assess whether the most effect-
ive and cost-effective treatment strategies are consistently
being employed [53], and on the development of innova-
tive strategies for the prevention and early detection of
asthma attacks.
We have produced the most comprehensive national
work ever undertaken estimating the prevalence, care
utilisation and financial costs of asthma in the UK. We
scoped, obtained data from and interrogated 27 health
and social care datasets from across the four nations of
the UK, which either used well-defined sampling strat-
egies (e.g. the national surveys) or covered large sections
of the population (e.g. primary care databases) or indeed
entire nations (e.g. hospital episode statistics and mortality
data). We believe that our findings are therefore likely to
be generalizable across the UK. Additional strengths come
from the fact that we followed a pre-specified analysis plan
and that we undertook a range of pre-specified sensitivity
analyses to test our assumptions [7].
There are, however, a number of limitations that need
to be considered. First, whilst we have undoubtedly
made progress in addressing important data gaps previ-
ously identified (e.g. in relation to providing estimates
for out-of-hours care, urgent care clinics, ambulance
trips, A&E attendances and ICU admissions), some still
exist, for example, in relation to out-patient clinic visits,
presenteeism (i.e. attending work when unwell) [54], and
absence from work to care for children [54]. Our results
from A&E data marts may be underestimates because
patients presenting with asthma exacerbations may not
always have been coded with asthma (with terms such as
shortness of breath or wheeze being used instead). We
could not access reliable data on prescribing of Omalizu-
mab, a biological agent used for severe, persistent
asthma [55]. Given the above described limitations, our
cost estimates should therefore be seen as minimum
likely financial costs to the UK public sector. Second,
whilst use of national surveys offers important insights
into patient perspectives, these exclude the homeless,
those living in institutional care and special populations
(e.g. armed forces and prisoners). Third, many of the
costs estimated in this study required extrapolation from
one country to another (Additional file 1: Appendix 5).
This process was undertaken by first rescaling based on
differences in Office of National Statistics population es-
timates, then by annual prevalence of clinician-reported-
diagnosed-and-treated (QOF) asthma between countries.
While broader definitions of asthma would be expected to
generate larger prevalence estimates within a country, we
might expect their relative rates between countries to be
similar and thus have minimally impacted this process.
However, this assumption is impossible to test since no
other definition of prevalence is uniformly measured
within all four countries. It was not possible to account
for differences in definitions of diagnosis of asthma (i.e.
before uplift to national level estimates where necessary)
as observed in differences between coding systems be-
cause basic resource use attributable to asthma is re-
corded using varying system coding based definitions
(such as Read or ICD-10). The extrapolation process add-
itionally accounted for differences in population by age
and sex and prevalence in countries, but due to data limi-
tations, could not account for other factors such as socio-
economic status/deprivation, ethnicity or disease severity
profiles. It also makes the assumption that the rate of re-
source use per asthma patient is the same in all UK coun-
tries. We made efforts to cross-validate this assumption
by comparing extrapolated results to known results, where
possible. Although the majority of these exercises pro-
duced similar figures, extrapolating inpatient episode costs
to and from Wales provided an exception due to the
higher rate of inpatient episodes observed in Wales
(Table 4). It is not possible to rule out similar issues where
extrapolation could not be cross-validated.
The
age-standardised
prevalence
and
burden
of
asthma reported in our study are not easily compared to
other estimates of asthma prevalence because (1) of dif-
ferences in the age-groups, time periods and geograph-
ical settings studied [1, 3, 56–59]; (2) in contrast to
many previous studies, we generated a number of esti-
mates of asthma ‘prevalence’; and (3) DALYs have been
reported in some previous studies (which was neither

 within the scope of this work nor was it possible given
the data gaps identified). Our estimate of the proportion
of medication cost broadly agrees with a systematic re-
view which found that medications accounted for 38 %
to 89 % of the total cost of asthma [5]. Although we have
captured more data sources and costs, the increases to
total costs were small and partially offset by more con-
servative prescribing assumptions. This is likely to ex-
plain why our costs are similar to a previous study in
England and Wales that estimated spending at £754.4 m
in 2000–02 [2], (£994.9 m at 2011–12 prices). They are
also lower in Scotland than a previous study which esti-
mated £98.1 m in 2003–05 (£117.0 m in 2011–12 prices)
[3], again likely due to methodological differences and
the more conservative approach used here. For example,
only the burden of asthma as the main problem of the
patient had been taken into account. Thus, for a patient
with asthma and comorbidities which might have re-
sulted in higher health and societal care utilisation, add-
itional
costs
of
care
for
comorbidities
were
not
accounted for. It is therefore important that these esti-
mates are not confused with burden of asthma, and it is
clarified that these estimates are for burden of asthma in
patients who utilised health and societal care when
asthma was their main problem. Despite these differ-
ences, there is broad agreement that the UK has one of
the highest asthma burdens in the world [1, 58, 60].
We have created a profile of asthma for the UK based
on available data. This information will be useful to na-
tional and regional policymakers and health planners both
in the UK and internationally since it can be used as a
template for similar mapping of asthma in other nations.
It should also be of considerable interest to respiratory
physicians, GPs and the public both to consider the
current level of health and social care utilisation and
by serving as a benchmark for national and regional
improvement efforts. Our work also has important
implications for the academic community, particularly
in relation to considering approaches to harmonising
definitions and data collection procedures across the
four nations of the UK [23], and in terms of finding
novel ways of filling the outstanding data gaps. Fi-
nally, this work will also offer a number of potentially
transferable lessons for generating robust national es-
timates of the epidemiology, care utilisation and costs
of other long-term conditions.
Conclusions
In summary, we have found that the UK continues to ex-
perience a very high disease and cost burden from asthma.
Since much of the morbidity and mortality is considered
potentially preventable, there is a need for ambitious na-
tional targets for reducing asthma exacerbations and the
associated risks of hospitalisations and deaths.
