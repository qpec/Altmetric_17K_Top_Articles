Contrary
 to the  general
 perception,
 the  United  States
 has  a
 much
 more  class-bound
 society  than
 other
wealthy
 countries.
 The  chance
 of  upward  mobility
 for Americans
 is  just  half  that  of
 the  citizens
 of  the
Denmark
 and  many  other  European
 countries.
 In addition
 to  other
 influences,
 the
 built  environment
 may
contribute
 to the  low  rate  of
 upward  mobility
 in  the  U.S.
 This  study
 tests  the  relationship
 between
 urban
sprawl
 and  upward  mobility
 for  commuting
 zones
 in  the  U.S.  We
 examine
 potential
 pathways
 through
which
 sprawl  may
 have  an  effect  on  mobility.
 We
 use  structural
 equation
 modeling
 to
 account
 for  both
direct
 and indirect
 effects  of  sprawl  on  upward  mobility.
 We  find  that  upward
 mobility
 is
 significantly
higher
 in compact
 areas  than  sprawling
 areas.  The
 direct  effect,  which  we  attribute
 to better
 job acces-
sibility
 in  more  compact
 commuting
 zones,  is  stronger  than  the  indirect
 effects.  Of  the  indirect
 effects,
only
 one,  through
 the  mediating  variable
 income
 segregation,
 is significant.

 Introduction
Rising
 income
 inequality,
 and
 associated
 lack
 of
 upward
 mobil-
ity,
 have
 emerged
 among
 the
 most
 important
 issues
 of
 our
 time,
prompting
 concern
 and
 commentary
 from
 top
 world
 leaders,
including
 President
 Obama
 and
 Pope
 Francis,
 and
 world
 class
 scho-
lars,
 such
 as
 Nobel
 Laureate
 Stiglitz
 (2012),
 New
 York
 columnist
and
 Nobel
 Laureate
 Paul
 Krugman,
 and
 Thomas
 Piketty
 (2014),
and
 many
 others.
 While
 inequality
 often
 makes
 headlines,
 upward
mobility
 or
 intergenerational
 mobility,
 concerned
 with
 the
 rela-
tionship
 between
 the
 socio-economic
 status
 of
 parents
 and
 the
socio-economic
 outcomes
 of
 their
 children
 as
 adults
 (Blanden,
2013),
 is
 barely
 on
 the
 radar
 of
 the
 urban
 planning
 profession.

Upward
 mobility
 and
 intergenerational
 mobility
 are
 linked
 and
overlap
 in
 the
 literature;
 however,
 upward
 mobility
 is
 a
 broader
term
 that
 refers
 to
 one’s
 ability
 to
 move
 to
 a
 higher
 income
 bracket
and
 social
 status
 and
 is
 often
 tied
 to
 one’s
 opportunities
 (Corak,
2013;
 Torche,
 2013).
 Areas
 with
 high
 levels
 of
 upward
 mobility
tend
 to
 have
 the
 following
 characteristics:
 “(1)
 less
 residential
 seg-
regation,
 (2)
 less
 income
 inequality,
 (3)
 better
 primary
 schools,
(4)
 greater
 social
 capital,
 and
 (5)
 greater
 family
 stability”
 (Chetty,
Hendren,
 Kline,
 &
 Saez,
 2014a;
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 &
Turner,
 2014b).
 Intergenerational
 mobility
 refers
 to
 changes
 in
income
 and
 social
 status
 among
 different
 generations
 but
 within
the
 same
 family
 (Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 &
 Saez,
 2014a;
 Chetty,
Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 &
 Turner,
 2014b;
 Corak,
 2013).
 Although
intergenerational
 can
 be
 an
 up,
 down,
 or
 lateral
 move,
 in
 the
research
 presented
 in
 this
 paper
 it
 is
 a
 measure
 of
 a
 child’s
 likeli-
hood
 of
 moving
 to
 a
 higher
 income
 bracket
 than
 his
 or
 her
 parents.
The
 ideal
 of
 upward
 mobility
 is
 rooted
 in
 the
 U.S.
 Declaration
of
 Independence:
 hard
 work
 is
 enough
 to
 create
 upward
 mobil-
ity,
 with
 greater
 opportunities
 than
 previous
 generations,

security,
 and
 affluence.
 But
 is
 the
 American
 idea
 equally
 achievable
for
 all
 societal
 groups?
 Recent
 studies
 show
 that
 the
 U.S.
 has
 one
of
 the
 lowest
 rates
 of
 upward
 mobility
 in
 the
 developed
 world,
 and
only
 a
 small
 proportion
 of
 citizens
 move
 from
 the
 class
 into
 which
they
 are
 born
 into
 a
 higher
 one
 (e.g.,
 DeParle,
 2012).
Americans
 experience
 less
 economic
 mobility
 than
 counter-
parts
 in
 Europe
 and
 Canada
 due
 in
 part
 to
 the
 extent
 of
 poverty
in
 the
 U.S.
 (DeParle,
 2012).
 A
 study
 from
 the
 Brookings
 Institu-
tion
 claims
 that
 one’s
 family
 is
 a
 large
 determinant
 of
 individual
success,
 more
 so
 in
 the
 U.S.
 than
 in
 other
 countries.
 Thirty-nine
percent
 of
 children
 born
 to
 parents
 in
 the
 top
 fifth
 of
 the
 income
distribution
 will
 remain
 in
 the
 top
 fifth
 for
 life,
 while
 42%
 of
 chil-
dren
 born
 to
 parents
 in
 the
 bottom
 fifth
 income
 distribution
 will
stay
 in
 that
 bottom
 fifth
 (Isaacs,
 Sawhill,
 &
 Haskins,
 2008).
 Further-
more,
 there
 is
 evidence
 that
 intergenerational
 mobility
 is
 lower
 in
the
 U.S.
 than
 in
 many
 other
 countries,
 such
 as
 France,
 Portugal,
Canada,
 and
 Norway
 (Isaacs
 et
 al.,
 2008).
 Additionally,
 others
 argue
that
 higher
 levels
 of
 income
 inequality
 limit
 the
 economic
 mobility
seen
 in
 future
 generations,
 a
 situation
 known
 as
 “The
 Great
 Gatsby
Curve”
 (Corak,
 2013).
Upward
 mobility
 and
 widening
 economic
 inequality
 are
 partic-
ularly
 pronounced
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 but
 it
 is
 a
 problem
 faced
elsewhere
 as
 well.
 A
 study
 by
 Jäntii
 et
 al.
 (2006)
 examines
 the
mobility
 outcomes
 and
 intergenerational
 mobility
 for
 six
 countries:
Denmark,
 Finland,
 Norway,
 Sweden,
 the
 United
 Kingdom,
 and
 the
United
 States.
 Looking
 at
 mobility
 for
 men
 who
 were
 born
 to
 fathers
in
 the
 bottom
 fifth
 income
 bracket,
 the
 findings
 show
 that
 these
men
 have
 a
 14%
 chance
 of
 climbing
 to
 the
 top
 fifth
 income
 bracket
in
 Finland,
 a
 12%
 chance
 in
 Denmark
 and
 the
 U.K.,
 and
 an
 11%
chance
 in
 Norway
 and
 Sweden.
 Only
 8%
 climbed
 to
 the
 top
 fifth
income
 bracket
 in
 the
 United
 States
 (Jäntii
 et
 al.,
 2006).
 At
 least
 one
quarter
 of
 these
 men
 remained
 in
 the
 lowest
 income
 bracket
 in
 all
six
 countries.
 Additional
 studies
 have
 found
 variation
 in
 inequal-
ity,
 both
 in
 terms
 of
 access
 to
 opportunities
 and
 advantages
 that
one
 is
 born
 with,
 across
 countries,
 ranging
 from
 relatively
 low
 lev-
els
 of
 inequality
 in
 Denmark,
 Norway,
 Sweden,
 and
 South
 Africa
 to
much
 higher
 levels
 of
 inequality
 in
 Guatemala
 and
 Brazil
 (Brunori,
Ferreira,
 &
 Peragine,
 2013).
Correlates
 of
 social
 mobility
 are
 an
 often-researched
 topic
 with
scholarly
 articles
 on
 the
 subject
 dating
 back
 to
 the
 1950s
 and
1960s.
 Much
 of
 the
 research
 has
 focused
 on
 race
 (Hardaway
 &
McLoyd,
 2008),
 family
 background
 (Black
 &
 Devereux,
 2010;
 Jäntii
et
 al.,
 2006),
 income
 (Corak,
 2006),
 and
 family
 structure
 (particu-
larly
 divorce
 –
 DeLeire
 &
 Lopoo,
 2010)
 as
 determinants
 of
 social
mobility.
 Poorly
 staffed
 and
 funded
 schools
 in
 poor
 and
 working-
class
 neighborhoods,
 inadequate
 prenatal
 nutrition
 and
 health
 care,
environmental
 hazards,
 and
 pollution
 are
 some
 other
 factors
 that
affect
 social
 mobility
 (Delgado,
 2007).
Countries
 with
 less
 intergenerational
 persistence
 tend
 to
 have
more
 state
 programs
 that
 ensure
 all
 children
 receive
 the
 same
 edu-
cation
 and
 try
 to
 minimize
 unequal
 investments
 in
 some
 children
(Altzinger,
 Cuaresma,
 Rumplmaier,
 Sauer,
 &
 Schneebaum,
 2015).
“Socioeconomic
 status
 influences
 a
 child’s
 health
 and
 aptitudes
 in
the
 early
 years
 –
 indeed
 even
 in
 utero
 –
 which
 in
 turn
 influences
early
 cognitive
 and
 social
 development,
 and
 readiness
 to
 learn.
These
 outcomes
 and
 the
 family
 circumstances
 of
 children,
 as
 well
as
 the
 quality
 of
 neighborhoods
 and
 schools,
 influence
 success
 in
primary
 school,
 which
 feeds
 into
 success
 in
 high
 school
 and
 col-
lege”
 (Corak,
 2013).
 Numerous
 studies
 have
 shown
 Scandinavian
countries,
 such
 as
 Sweden
 and
 Norway,
 having
 a
 “uniquely
 egal-
itarian
 mobility
 regime”
 (Esping-Andersen
 &
 Wagner,
 2012)
 due
in
 large
 part
 to
 state
 redistribution
 and
 removal
 of
 financial
 con-
straint
 (Esping-Andersen,
 2004;
 Jaeger
 &
 Holm,
 2007).
 Regardless
of
 socioeconomic
 status
 all
 children
 receive
 the
 same
 education,
and
 standards
 of
 education
 and
 teaching
 are
 consistent
 across
 the
country.
 Removing
 any
 barriers
 to
 a
 quality
 education,
 therefore,
contributes
 to
 the
 relatively
 high
 levels
 of
 social
 mobility
 seen
 in
Scandinavian
 countries.
In
 addition
 to
 these
 factors
 and
 conditions,
 in
 this
 paper
 we  ask
whether
 metropolitan
 sprawl
 contributes
 to
 the
 low
 rate
 of
 upward
mobility
 for
 lower-income
 residents.
 The
 most
 important
 indica-
tor
 of
 sprawl
 is
 poor
 accessibility
 (Ewing,
 1997).
 Poor
 accessibility
may
 be
 a
 particular
 problem
 for
 certain
 socioeconomic
 groups,
since
 low
 income
 and
 low
 automobile
 ownership
 make
 the
 dis-
tances
 inherent
 in
 sprawl
 harder
 to
 overcome.
 The
 spatial
 mismatch
of
 low-income
 (and
 often
 minority)
 residents
 in
 inner
 cities,
 and
low-skill
 jobs
 in
 the
 suburbs,
 is
 particularly
 a
 serious
 case
 of
 inac-
cessibility.
 Evidence
 demonstrates
 that
 low-income
 residents
 have
limited
 transportation
 mobility
 and
 inaccessibility
 to
 job
 opportu-
nities
 can
 affect
 their
 social
 mobility
 (Chapple,
 2001;
 Grengs,
 2010;
Ong
 &
 Miller,
 2005).
 Still,
 there
 is
 no
 evidence
 in
 the
 literature
on
 how
 sprawl
 itself
 may
 affect
 the
 upward
 mobility
 of
 youth
 in
disadvantaged
 families.
In
 this
 context,
 we  test
 hypotheses
 about
 the
 connections
between
 urban
 sprawl
 and
 upward
 mobility
 for
 metropolitan
 areas
and
 divisions
 in
 the
 U.S.
 using
 the
 recently
 released
 upward
 mobil-
ity
 data
 from
 the
 Equality
 of
 Opportunity
 Project1 and
 the
 recently
released
 compactness
 indices
 from
 Measuring
 Sprawl
 2014.2 We
hypothesize
 three
 mediating
 (intermediate)
 variables
 between
sprawl
 and
 upward
 mobility:
 social
 capital,
 racial
 segregation
 and
income
 segregation.
 We  then
 use
 structural
 equation
 modeling
to
 evaluate
 these
 hypotheses
 and
 estimate
 the
 strengths
 of
 vari-
ous
 connections
 between
 sprawl
 and
 upward
 mobility.
 While
 our
example
 focuses
 on
 conditions
 in
 the
 U.S.,
 we
 believe
 the
 principles
apply
 to
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 as
 well.

 Urban
 sprawl
 and
 upward
 mobility
2.1.
 Upward
 mobility
 and
 the
 Equality
 of
 Opportunity
 Project
Large
 inequality
 reduces
 upward
 mobility,
 which
 limits
 poten-
tial
 development
 of
 children
 and
 maintains
 inequality
 for
 future
generations.
 Intergenerational
 inequality
 and
 upward
 mobility
have
 therefore
 generated
 huge
 concerns
 lately.
 However,
 the
 cur-
rent
 knowledge
 on
 generational
 mobility
 remains
 limited,
 and
often
 ignores
 urban
 form
 and
 geographical
 contexts
 (Rothwell
 &
Massey,
 2015).
A
 notable
 addition
 to
 our
 knowledge
 of
 upward
 mobility
 is
 “The
Equality
 of
 Opportunity
 Project,”
 which
 found
 that
 one
 of
 the
 key
determinants
 of
 social
 mobility
 is
 geography;
 where
 a
 person
 grows
up
 may
 dictate
 how
 likely
 that
 person
 is
 to
 move
 out
 of
 the
 social
class
 into
 which
 he
 or
 she
 was
 born
 (Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 &
 Saez,
2013).
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
Kline,
 Saez,
 and
 Turner
 (2014b)
 noted
 that
 upward
 mobility
 differs
significantly
 across
 U.S.
 cities
 and
 some
 cities
 such
 as
 Salt
 Lake
 City
and
 San
 Jose
 have
 rates
 of
 upward
 mobility
 similar
 to
 European
countries
 while
 other
 cities
 such
 as
 Atlanta
 and
 Milwaukee
 have
lower
 rates
 of
 mobility
 than
 any
 developed
 country.
 For
 example,
the
 likelihood
 that
 a
 child
 starting
 in
 the
 bottom
 fifth
 of
 the
 national
income
 distribution
 will
 reach
 the
 top
 fifth
 is
 4.4%
 in
 Charlotte
 but
12.9%
 in
 San
 Jose
 (Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 &
 Saez,
 2014a;
 Chetty,
Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 &
 Turner,
 2014b).
What
 struck
 us
 immediately
 about
 these
 findings
 is
 a
 possi-
ble
 connection
 of
 upward
 mobility
 to
 sprawl.
 According
 to
 the
metropolitan
 compactness/sprawl
 indices
 (Ewing,
 Pendall,
 &
 Chen,
2002),
 and
 a
 more
 recent
 study
 (Ewing
 &
 Hamidi,
 2014),
 Atlanta
and
 Charlotte
 are
 at
 the
 sprawling
 end
 of
 the
 scale,
 while
 Salt
 Lake
City
 and
 San
 Jose
 are
 far
 more
 compact.
 This
 raises
 the
 question

of
 whether
 metropolitan
 sprawl,
 and
 the
 poor
 accessibility
 it
occasions,
 contribute
 to
 the
 low
 rates
 of
 upward
 mobility
 for
lower-income
 classes
 in
 sprawling
 metropolitan
 areas.
Chetty
 et
 al.
 (2013),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 and
 Turner
 (2014b)
 have
 tested
 for
correlations
 between
 upward
 mobility
 and
 possible
 causal
 factors
(via
 bivariate
 correlations).
 While
 they
 caution
 that
 their
 findings
cannot
 be
 interpreted
 as
 causal
 effects,
 they
 do
 find
 strong
 correla-
tions
 between
 upward
 mobility
 and
 six
 factors:
• Income
 growth
 –
 Commuting
 zones
 (analogous
 to
 metropolitan
areas)
 with
 low
 levels
 of
 income
 growth
 have
 low
 rates
 of
 upward
mobility.
• Racial
 segregation
 –
 Commuting
 zones
 with
 high
 levels
 of
 racial
segregation
 have
 low
 rates
 of
 upward
 mobility.
• Income
 inequality
 –
 Commuting
 zones
 with
 high
 levels
 of
 income
inequality
 have
 low
 rates
 of
 upward
 mobility.
• Quality
 of
 K-12
 schools
 –
 Commuting
 zones
 with
 poor
 schools
have
 low
 rates
 of
 upward
 mobility.
• Social
 capital
 –
 Commuting
 zones
 with
 low
 levels
 of
 social
 capi-
tal
 (poor
 social
 networks
 and
 low
 community
 involvement)
 have
low
 rates
 of
 upward
 mobility.
• Family
 structure
 –
 Commuting
 zones
 with
 high
 levels
 of
 single
parenting
 have
 low
 rates
 of
 upward
 mobility.
Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
Kline,
 Saez,
 and
 Turner
 (2014b)
 also
 speculate
 on
 a
 link
 between
sprawl
 and
 upward
 mobility.
 They
 operationalize
 sprawl
 in
 terms
of
 commute
 times
 to
 work,
 but
 that
 is
 as
 far
 as
 they
 go.
 “.
 .
 .
 we
 also
find
 that
 upward
 mobility
 is
 higher
 in
 cities
 with
 less
 sprawl,
 as
measured
 by
 commute
 times
 to
 work”
 (Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 &
Saez,
 2014a;
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 &
 Turner,
 2014b).
 How-
ever,
 commute
 times
 to
 work
 is
 not
 a
 valid
 proxy
 for
 urban
 sprawl.
Indeed,
 some
 of
 the
 most
 compact
 metropolitan
 areas
 have
 some
of
 the
 longest
 commute
 times,
 by
 virtue
 of
 their
 size
 and
 heavy
use
 of
 transit
 (which
 typically
 involves
 longer
 travel
 times
 than
automobiles).
 For
 example,
 according
 to
 the
 American
 Community
Survey
 5-year
 estimates
 (2008–2012),
 the
 New
 York
 metropolitan
area,
 one
 of
 the
 most
 compact
 metropolitan
 areas
 by
 many
 rank-
ings
 (Ewing
 et
 al.,
 2002;
 Ewing
 &
 Hamidi,
 2014;
 Galster
 et
 al.,
 2001),
has
 the
 longest
 average
 commute
 time
 of
 all
 metropolitan
 areas
in
 the
 U.S.
 So,
 in
 this
 study
 we
 use
 the
 recently
 released
 comact-
ness/sprawl
 index
 (Ewing
 &
 Hamidi,
 2014)
 as
 our
 measure
 of
 urban
form
 to
 test
 the
 association
 between
 sprawl
 and
 upward
 mobility.
2.2.
 Urban
 sprawl
 index:
 measuring
 sprawl
 2014
More
 than
 a
 decade
 ago,
 Ewing
 et
 al.
 developed
 compact-
ness/sprawl
 indices
 for
 metropolitan
 areas
 and
 counties
 that
placed
 compact
 development
 at
 one
 end
 of
 a
 continuum
 and
urban
 sprawl
 at
 the
 other
 (Ewing,
 Pendall,
 &
 Chen,
 2003a;Ewing,
Schmid,
 Killingsworth,
 Zlot,
 &
 Raudenbush,
 2003b;Ewing,
 Schieber,
&
 Zegeer,
 2003c).
 The
 compactness
 indices
 have
 been
 widely
 used
in
 outcome-related
 research,
 particularly
 in
 connection
 with
 pub-
lic
 health.
 Sprawl
 has
 been
 studied
 in
 relation
 to
 traffic
 fatalities,
physical
 inactivity,
 obesity,
 heart
 disease,
 cancer
 prevalence,
 air
pollution,
 extreme
 heat
 events,
 residential
 energy
 use,
 social
 capi-
tal,
 emergency
 response
 times,
 teenage
 driving,
 and
 private-vehicle
commute
 distances
 and
 times.
 While
 most
 studies
 have
 linked
sprawl
 to
 negative
 outcomes,
 there
 have
 been
 exceptions
 (see,
 in
particular,
 Holcombe
 &
 Williams,
 2010).
In
 a
 recent
 study,
 the
 county
 and
 metropolitan
 compactness
indices
 were
 refined
 and
 updated
 to
 2010
 (Ewing
 &
 Hamidi,
 2014).
The
 refined
 indices,
 similar
 to
 the
 original
 indices,
 have
 four
distinct
 dimensions-development
 density,
 land
 use
 mix,
 popula-
tion
 and
 employment
 centering,
 and
 street
 connectivity.
 However,
compared
 to
 metropolitan
 sprawl
 indices
 from
 the
 early
 2000s,
these
 new
 indices
 incorporate
 more
 variables
 and
 have
 more
 con-
struct
 validity.
 The
 variables
 used
 in
 the
 refined
 indices
 are
 either
substitutes
 for
 the
 original
 variables
 (refinements,
 it
 could
 be
argued)
 or
 additions
 to
 fill
 in
 for
 omitted
 variables
 with
 intuitive
relations
 to
 sprawl
 (Ewing
 &
 Hamidi,
 2014).
We
 used
 the
 refined
 indices
 as
 our
 measure
 of
 compactness
in
 this
 study.
 By
 these
 metrics,
 New
 York
 and
 San
 Francisco
 are
the
 most
 compact
 regions
 while
 Hickory,
 NC
 and
 Atlanta,
 GA  are
the
 most
 sprawling.
 Compactness

 scores
 for
 metropolitan
areas,
 counties,
 and
 census
 tracts
 in
 2010

 on
 a

Cancer
 Institute

2.3.
 Effects
 of
 sprawl
 on
 upward
 mobility
2.3.1.
 Job
 inaccessibility
The
 most
 obvious
 direct
 effect
 of
 sprawl
 on
 upward
 mobility
 is
through
 inaccessibility
 of
 workers
 to
 jobs.
 After
 World
 War
 II,
 many
wealthy
 Americans
 decentralized
 out
 of
 the
 core
 cities
 and
 moved
to
 the
 suburbs.
 Shopping
 and
 ancillary
 services
 followed
 them,
leaving
 poor
 and
 minority
 populations
 behind.
 In
 this
 regard,
 John
Kain
 (1968)
 formulated
 the
 spatial
 mismatch
 hypothesis,
 arguing
that
 poor
 black
 workers
 left
 in
 central
 cities
 were
 increasingly
 dis-
tant
 from
 and
 poorly
 connected
 to
 major
 centers
 of
 employment
 in
suburban
 areas.
 They
 were
 constrained
 by
 discrimination
 in
 labor
and
 housing
 markets
 and
 central
 city
 job
 shortages.
 The
 spatial
mismatch
 hypothesis
 has
 important
 implications
 for
 inner
 city
 resi-
dents
 that
 are
 dependent
 on
 low-level
 entry
 jobs.
 Distance
 from
work
 centers
 can
 lead
 to
 increasing
 unemployment
 rates
 among
inner
 city
 residents
 and
 thereby
 increasing
 poverty
 outcomes
 for
the
 region
 as
 a
 whole.
Many
 empirical
 studies
 tested
 the
 spatial
 mismatch
 hypothe-
sis
 in
 the
 early
 1970s,
 soon
 after
 the
 advance
 of
 the
 hypothesis
 by
Kain.
 There
 was
 resurgent
 interest
 in
 the
 hypothesis
 in
 the
 early
1990s,
 when
 at
 least
 five
 review
 articles
 were
 published
 (Holzer,
1991;
 Ihlanfeldt,
 1994;
 Jencks
 &
 Mayer,
 1990;
 Kain,
 1992;
 Moss
 &
Tilly,
 1991),
 and
 at
 least
 six
 more
 after
 2000
 (Blumenberg,
 2004;
Blumenberg
 &
 Manville,
 2004;
 Chapple,
 2006;
 Fan,
 2012;
 Gobillon,
Selod,
 &
 Zenou,
 2007;
 Houston,
 2005).
 The
 focus
 on
 African
 Amer-
icans
 has
 shifted
 to
 include
 other
 minorities,
 low-income
 single
mothers,
 welfare
 recipients,
 and
 immigrants
 (Fan,
 2012).
 A
 recent
study
 further
 supports
 the
 importance
 of
 considering
 the
 shifting
distribution
 of
 people
 and
 jobs
 to
 economic
 and
 social
 outcomes
(Kneebone
 &
 Holmes,
 2015).
 While
 the
 majority
 of
 studies
 con-
ducted
 since
 then
 have
 found
 that
 the
 spatial
 mismatch
 hypothesis
holds
 true
 40
 years
 after
 Kain’s
 initial
 formulation,
 not
 all
 stud-
ies
 support
 the
 hypothesis
 (Blumenberg,
 2004).
 Several
 alternative
explanations
 have
 also
 been
 suggested,
 such
 as
 the
 “modal
 mis-
match,”
 which
 argues
 that
 employment
 is
 inaccessible
 to
 careless
residents
 in
 cities
 with
 auto-oriented
 development
 patterns
 (Fan,
2012).
A
 further
 explanation
 expanding
 upon
 the
 initial
 hypothesis
is
 that
 an
 information
 mismatch
 keeps
 inner
 city
 residents
 from
landing
 a
 job.
 Networking
 and
 information
 spillovers
 are
 a
 major
advantage
 in
 accessing
 information
 about
 potential
 job
 openings.
Information
 access
 to
 jobs
 may
 hinder
 matches
 between
 inner
 city
workers
 and
 suburban
 jobs.
 People
 who
 are
 living
 far
 from
 job
centers
 are
 generally
 less
 knowledgeable
 about
 potential
 openings
than
 individuals
 who
 live
 closer
 to
 job
 centers.
Horner
 and
 Mefford
 (2007)
 analyzed
 conditions
 for
 spatial
 mis-
match
 controlling
 for
 race,
 ethnicity,
 and
 the
 mode
 of
 commuting.

The
 results
 revealed
 how
 potential
 commute
 options
 differ
 across
commuter
 groups
 and
 how
 minority
 job-housing
 opportunities
 are
more
 spatially
 constrained.
 Their
 analysis
 confirmed
 that
 minority
residential
 and
 employment
 patterns
 differ
 from
 their
 non-
minority
 counterparts,
 and
 that
 these
 differences
 manifest
 them-
selves
 in
 a
 more
 spatially
 restricted
 pattern
 of
 residential
 location.
While
 the
 focus
 is
 different,
 the
 concept
 of
 jobs-housing
 balance
is
 also
 related
 to
 spatial
 mismatch.
 Jobs-housing
 balance
 requires
a
 match-up
 between
 the
 skill
 level
 of
 local
 residents
 and
 local
 job
opportunities
 as
 well
 as
 between
 the
 earnings
 of
 workers
 and
 the
cost
 of
 local
 housing
 (Cervero,
 1989;
 Stoker
 &
 Ewing,
 2014).
 The
imbalance
 occurs
 because
 some
 parts
 of
 the
 metropolitan
 area
 are
job-rich
 and
 housing-poor,
 others
 are
 housing-rich
 and
 job-poor,
and
 few
 provide
 both
 residences
 and
 employment
 sites
 for
 roughly
an
 equal
 number
 of
 people
 of
 comparable
 skill
 levels
 (Cervero,
1989).
Cervero
 and
 Duncan
 (2006)
 compared
 vehicle
 travel
 to
 jobs-
housing
 balance
 and
 retail-housing
 mix.
 Using
 regression
 models
they
 isolated
 the
 effects
 of
 vehicle
 miles
 traveled
 (VMT)
 against
accessibility
 variables
 and
 control
 variables.
 The
 study
 showed
 that
linking
 jobs
 and
 housing
 holds
 a
 significant
 potential
 to
 reduce
VMT.
 Cervero
 and
 Duncan
 (2006,
 p.
 488)
 suggest
 that
 “achieving
jobs-housing
 balance
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 ways
 land-use
planning
 can
 contribute
 to
 reducing
 motorized
 travel.”
 Similarly,
Sarzynski,
 Wolman,
 Galster,
 and
 Hanson
 (2006)
 examined
 the
influences
 of
 land
 use
 in
 1990
 on
 subsequent
 changes
 in
 commute
times
 in
 2000
 for
 a
 sample
 of
 50
 large
 U.S.
 urban
 areas.
 They
 found
that
 job-housing
 proximity
 was
 the
 only
 built-environment
 vari-
able
 negatively
 and
 significantly
 associated
 with
 commute
 time.
2.3.2.
 Social
 capital
One
 indirect
 effect
 of
 sprawl
 on
 upward
 mobility
 may
 be
through
 social
 capital.
 The
 central
 premise
 of
 social
 capital
 is
 that
social
 networks
 have
 value.
 Just
 as
 a
 machine
 (physical
 capital)
or
 an
 education
 (human
 capital)
 can
 increase
 productivity,
 so
 can
social
 contacts.
 People
 with
 higher
 levels
 of
 social
 capital
 can
 lever-
age
 their
 relationships
 to
 find
 jobs,
 capture
 new
 opportunities,
 and
benefit
 from
 community
 support.
The
 majority
 of
 studies
 on
 the
 relationship
 between
 sprawl
 and
social
 capital
 have
 focused
 on
 factors
 such
 as
 trust
 and
 neighbor-
hood
 ties
 (Brueckner
 &
 Largey,
 2006;
 Freeman,
 2001;
 Gottlieb
 &
Glaeser,
 2006;
 Leyden,
 2003;
 Lund,
 2003;
 Nguyen,
 2010).
 Freeman
(2001)
 noticed
 a
 negative
 relationship
 between
 the
 level
 of
 car
usage
 and
 the
 level
 of
 social
 ties
 in
 neighborhoods.
 Leyden
 (2003)
found
 that
 high
 neighborhood
 walkability
 resulted
 in
 a
 higher
likelihood
 of
 establishing
 relationships
 with
 one’s
 neighbors,
 gen-
erating
 social
 interaction,
 and
 enhancing
 political
 participation.
Lund
 (2003)
 tested
 New
 Urbanist
 claims
 that
 placing
 amenities
such
 as
 parks
 and
 retail
 shops
 within
 walking
 distance
 of
 homes
 will
increase
 pedestrian
 travel
 and
 thereby
 increase
 interaction
 among
neighbors.
However,
 some
 have
 demonstrated
 that
 social
 capital
 is
 not
diminished
 by
 suburban
 sprawl.
 Using
 DDB
 Needham
 Lifestyle
 Sur-
vey
 data,
 Gottlieb
 and
 Glaeser
 (2006)
 found
 that
 the
 rates
 of
 four
types
 of
 social-capital
 activities,
 like
 attending
 churches,
 volunteer-
ing
 for
 community
 projects,
 contacting
 public
 officials
 or
 other
 civic
engagement,
 and
 registering
 to
 vote,
 are
 lower
 among
 residents
 of
center
 cities.
Most
 recently,
 Nguyen
 (2010)
 related
 Ewing
 et
 al.’s
 original
county
 compactness/sprawl
 index
 to
 social-capital
 factors
 from
 the
Social
 Capital
 Community
 Benchmark
 Survey
 and
 found
 that
 urban
sprawl
 may
 support
 some
 types
 of
 social
 capital
 while
 reducing
others.
 So
 though
 the
 evidence
 on
 the
 effects
 of
 sprawl
 on
 social
capital
 is
 clearly
 mixed,
 it
 certainly
 provides
 a
 pathway
 between
sprawl
 and
 upward
 mobility.
2.3.3.
 Racial
 segregation
Another
 indirect
 effect
 of
 sprawl
 on
 upward
 mobility
 may
 be
through
 racial
 segregation.
 Upward
 income
 mobility
 is
 negatively
related
 to
 the
 percentage
 of
 African-Americans
 in
 the
 population
(Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 &
 Saez,
 2014a;
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
Saez,
 &
 Turner,
 2014b).
 Even
 whites
 in
 areas
 with
 large
 minority
populations
 have
 a
 smaller
 chance
 of
 upward
 mobility,
 implying
that
 race
 matters
 at
 the
 community
 level.
 Economic
 disadvan-
tages
 are
 exacerbated
 when
 races
 are
 segregated,
 thereby
 reducing
exposure
 to
 role
 models,
 decreasing
 funding
 for
 public
 schools,
 or
hindering
 access
 to
 employment
 (Cutler
 &
 Glaeser,
 1997;
 Massey
 &
Denton,
 1993;
 Sanchez,
 Liu,
 Leathers,
 Goins,
 &
 Vilain,
 2012;
 Wilson,
1987).
There
 is
 mixed
 evidence
 on
 how
 sprawl
 impacts
 racial
 segre-
gation.
 Some
 studies
 point
 to
 the
 cost
 of
 housing/land
 as
 the
 main
contributor
 to
 black-white
 residential
 segregation.
 Controlling
 for
household
 income
 and
 racial
 segregation,
 Kahn
 (2001)
 has
 shown
that
 sprawl
 closes
 the
 gap
 between
 rates
 of
 suburban
 homeown-
ership
 for
 African-Americans
 and
 whites.
 Kahn
 also
 found
 that
blacks
 tend
 to
 own
 larger
 homes
 in
 sprawling
 regions.
 This
 is
 pre-
sumably
 a
 result
 of
 more
 affordable
 housing
 in
 sprawling
 regions.
Further
 evidence
 of
 the
 mixed
 relationship
 between
 sprawl
 and
racial
 segregation
 comes
 from
 Ragussett
 (2014),
 who
 found
 that
the
 relationship
 between
 black-white
 housing
 gaps
 varied
 substan-
tially
 across
 metropolitan
 areas
 with
 varying
 levels
 of
 sprawl.
Galster
 and
 Cutsinger
 (2007)
 found
 a
 direct
 correlation
 between
land
 use
 patterns
 and
 levels
 of
 black
 and
 white
 segregation
 in
 50
U.S.
 metropolitan
 areas.
 They
 posited
 that
 “the
 dominant
 relation-
ship
 observed
 is
 that,
 on
 several
 measures,
 more
 sprawl-like
 land
use
 patterns
 are
 associated
 with
 less
 segregation”
 (p.
 540).
 They
further
 identified
 the
 housing
 price
 effect
 as
 the
 main
 mechanism
through
 which
 sprawl
 influences
 racial
 segregation.
 In
 contrast,
Nelson,
 Sanchez,
 and
 Dawkins
 (2004a)
 showed
 that
 growth
 man-
agement
 measures
 were
 effective
 at
 reducing
 racial
 segregation
in
 metropolitan
 areas
 between
 1990
 and
 2000.
 In
 a
 follow-up
study,
 Nelson,
 Sanchez,
 and
 Dawkins
 (2004b)
 examined
 the
 result
of
 locally
 adopted
 U.S.
 urban
 containment
 policies
 on
 the
 change
 in
racial
 segregation
 among
 metropolitan
 areas
 during
 the
 1990s
 and
found
 areas
 that
 had
 adopted
 “strong”
 urban
 containment
 policy
for
 10
 years
 experienced
 1.4
 percentage
 points
 less
 Anglo-African
American
 segregation
 than
 those
 that
 did
 not.
 This
 is
 about
 one-
third
 of
 the
 total
 increase
 in
 this
 segregation
 measure
 for
 all
 U.S.
metropolitan
 areas
 during
 the
 1990s
 (Nelson
 et
 al.,
 2004b).
 The
mixed
 literature
 on
 urban
 form
 and
 racial
 segregation
 calls
 for
 an
update
 on
 the
 interplay
 between
 sprawl,
 racial
 segregation
 and
upward
 mobility.
2.3.4.
 Income
 segregation
A
 third
 indirect
 effect
 of
 sprawl
 on
 upward
 mobility
 may
 be
through
 income
 segregation.
 Though
 income
 segregation
 is
 related
to
 spatial
 mismatch
 and
 racial
 segregation,
 it
 is
 operationalized
 dif-
ferently.
 As
 with
 racial
 segregation,
 economic
 disadvantages
 may
be
 exacerbated
 when
 income
 classes
 are
 segregated,
 thereby
 reduc-
ing
 exposure
 to
 successful
 role
 models,
 decreasing
 funding
 for
 local
public
 schools,
 or
 hindering
 access
 to
 employment
 (Wilson,
 1987).
Margo
 (1992)
 argues
 that
 the
 movement
 of
 metropolitan
 popu-
lations
 in
 the
 U.S.
 toward
 suburban
 locales
 over
 the
 latter
 half
 of
 the
20th
 century
 can
 be
 linked,
 to
 a
 significant
 degree,
 to
 the
 rise
 in
 per-
sonal
 income.
 As
 individual
 income
 rose,
 so
 did
 the
 demand
 for
 land
and
 housing
 among
 higher
 income
 individuals.
 As
 a
 result,
 higher-
income
 households
 moved
 to
 the
 outskirts,
 while
 lower-income
households
 remained
 within
 central
 cities.
 Patterns
 of
 income
 seg-
regation
 may
 be
 more
 pronounced
 in
 sprawling
 metropolitan
 areas
than
 compact
 areas.
According
 to
 Jargowsky
 (2002),
 this
 movement
 of
 higher-
income
 households
 and
 isolation
 of
 lower-income
 households
 in
 84
 
R.
 Ewing
 et

 /

 (2016)
 80–88
the
 central
 cities
 lead
 to
 concentrations
 of
 poverty
 and
 a
 lack
 of
resources,
 such
 as
 employment
 and
 educational
 opportunities.
 Fur-
thermore,
 he
 argues
 that
 “these
 spatial
 disparities
 increase
 poverty
in
 the
 short
 run
 and
 reduce
 equality
 of
 opportunity,
 therefore
contributing
 to
 inequality
 in
 the
 long
 run”
 (Jargowsky,
 2002,
 p.
 40).
Wheeler
 (2006)
 tested
 if
 urban
 decentralization
 and
 income
inequality
 were
 associated
 with
 each
 other,
 and
 found
 an
 inverse
relationship
 between
 urban
 density
 and
 the
 degree
 of
 income
inequality
 within
 metropolitan
 areas,
 thereby
 suggesting
 that,
 as
cities
 spread
 out,
 they
 become
 increasingly
 segregated
 by
 income
(Wheeler,
 2006).

 Methods
3.1.
 Data
 and
 measures
We  used
 data
 on
 upward
 mobility
 and
 covariates
 from
 the
Equality
 of
 Opportunity
 databases
 of
 Chetty
 et
 al.
 (2013),
 Chetty,
Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
and
 Turner
 (2014b),
 and
 added
 a
 sprawl
 metric
 from
 the
 Measur-
ing
 Sprawl
 2014
 database
 for
 metropolitan
 areas
 (see
 Table
 1).
 Our
measure
 of
 upward
 mobility
 is
 the
 likelihood
 that
 a
 child
 born
 into
the
 bottom
 fifth
 of
 the
 national
 income
 distribution
 reached
 the
 top
fifth
 by
 age
 30.
We
 posit
 three
 mediating
 variables
 connecting
 sprawl
 with
upward
 mobility
 indirectly:
 social
 capital,
 racial
 segregation,
 and
income
 segregation.
 The
 social
 capital
 index
 (SCI)
 from
 the
 Chetty,
Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
and
 Turner
 (2014b)
 database
 is
 our
 proxy
 for
 social
 capital.
 Chetty,
Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 and
Turner
 (2014b)
 borrowed
 it
 from
 Putnam
 (2007)
 and
 Rupasingha
and
 Goetz
 (2008).
 This
 index
 is
 made
 up
 of
 voter
 turnout
 rates,
return
 rates
 on
 census
 forms,
 and
 various
 measures
 of
 participation
in
 community
 organizations.
Racial
 segregation
 was
 borrowed
 from
 the
 Chetty
 et
 al.
 (2013)
study
 for
 commuting
 zones
 and
 was
 computed
 based
 on
 census
2000
 data.
 Finally,
 the
 segregation
 of
 poverty,
 as
 a
 proxy
 for
 income
segregation,
 was
 also
 borrowed
 from
 Chetty
 et
 al.
 (2013)
 and
 is
defined
 as
 the
 extent
 to
 which
 individuals
 in
 the
 bottom
 fourth
 of
the
 population
 are
 segregated
 from
 those
 with
 higher
 incomes.
Our
 exogenous
 variables
 (that
 drive
 the
 system
 in
 this
 analysis)
are
 the
 rate
 of
 income
 growth
 between
 2000
 and
 2010,
 the
 share
 of
families
 with
 kids
 with
 a
 female
 head
 of
 household
 and
 no
 husband
in
 2000,
 the
 mean
 school
 district
 expenditure
 per
 pupil
 in
 1996,
 and
the
 metropolitan
 compactness/sprawl
 index
 for
 2010.
 In
 line
 with
Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
Saez,
 and
 Turner
 (2014b),
 we
 would
 expect
 that
 upward
 mobility
 is
positively
 related
 to
 the
 rate
 of
 income
 growth
 and
 school
 spending,
and
 negatively
 related
 to
 the
 share
 of
 female
 headed
 households
with
 children.
 We
 might
 also
 expect
 that
 upward
 mobility
 is
 related
to
 metropolitan
 compactness,
 due
 (as
 discussed
 above)
 to
 differ-
ences
 in
 accessibility
 of
 workers
 to
 jobs.
Regarding
 the
 metropolitan
 compactness
 index,
 the
 exogenous
variable
 of
 greatest
 interest,
 we  would
 have
 preferred
 using
 an
index
 for
 a
 year
 near
 the
 midpoint
 of
 the
 30-year
 period
 over
 which
upward
 mobility
 manifests
 itself,
 but
 did
 not
 have
 such
 an
 index.
From
 a
 longitudinal
 analysis
 of
 changes
 in
 sprawl
 between
 2000
and
 2010
 (Hamidi
 &
 Ewing,
 2014),
 we
 know
 that
 urban
 form
 does
not
 change
 dramatically
 from
 decade
 to
 decade.
 Again
 we
 use
 com-
pactness
 indices
 from
 the
 Measuring
 Sprawl
 2014
 project.
The
 indices
 are
 for
 metropolitan
 areas
 rather
 than
 commuting
zones
 as
 defined
 by
 Chetty
 et
 al.
 (2013).
 Commuting
 zones
 include
rural
 counties
 and
 sometimes
 more
 than
 one
 metropolitan
 area.
 In
the
 latter
 case,
 we
 computed
 weighted
 averages
 of
 the
 metropoli-
tan
 compactness/sprawl
 index,
 weighting
 by
 population.
 Because
boundaries
 of
 commuting
 zones
 and
 metropolitan
 areas
 are
 not
coincident,
 we
 dropped
 commuting
 zones
 from
 our
 sample
 if
 their
populations
 differed
 from
 the
 combined
 metropolitan
 areas’
 by
more
 than
 25%.
 It
 is
 unfortunate
 that
 we  lost
 observations
 in
 this
manner,
 but
 we
 still
 had
 a
 sample
 of
 122
 commuting
 zones
 from
which
 to
 estimate
 our
 models.
3.2.
 Analytical
 methods
We  used
 structural
 equation
 modeling
 (SEM)
 to
 estimate
 both
direct
 and
 indirect
 effects
 of
 urban
 sprawl
 on
 upward
 mobility.
SEM
 seeks
 to
 evaluate
 theoretically
 justified
 models
 against
 data
(Grace,
 2006),
 wherein
 a
 set
 of
 equations
 is
 solved
 using
 maximum
likelihood
 methods.
 There
 is
 an
 equation
 for
 each
 “response”
 or
“endogenous”
 variable.
 These
 are
 modeled
 in
 terms
 of
 “drivers”
or
 “exogenous”
 variables.
 SEM
 offers
 important,
 additional
 bene-
fits
 over
 multivariate
 regression
 including
 various
 ways
 of
 dealing
with
 multicollinearity
 (Grace,
 2006).
We
 estimated
 our
 SE
 model
 of
 upward
 mobility
 with
 Amos
 19.0
and
 maximum
 likelihood
 procedures.
 We  analyzed
 data
 for
 122
metropolitan
 areas
 and
 divisions
 that
 had
 no
 missing
 data.
As
 suggested
 by
 the
 literature,
 we
 included
 three
 plausi-
ble
 causal
 pathways
 connecting
 sprawl
 indirectly
 with
 upward

 is
 standard
practice
 in

 to
 permit

important
 finding.
 Let
 us
 consider
 each
 indirect
 effect
 in
 turn.
 The
compactness
 index
 is
 inversely
 related
 to
 racial
 segregation,
 but
not
 at
 a
 significant
 level.
 The
 compactness
 index
 is
 directly
 related
to
 both
 social
 capital
 and
 poverty
 segregation.
 Of
 these
 two
 vari-
ables,
 poverty
 segregation
 has
 a
 significant
 negative
 relationship
 to
upward
 mobility,
 as
 expected,
 while
 social
 capital
 has
 no
 relation-
ship
 to
 upward
 mobility.
Of
 the
 other
 exogenous
 variables
 in
 the
 model,
 income
 growth
is
 positively
 related
 to
 upward
 mobility,
 while
 the
 share
 of
 female
headed
 households
 with
 kids
 is
 negatively
 related
 to
 upward
 mobil-
ity.
 Both
 income
 growth
 and
 female
 headed
 families
 have
 indirect
relationships
 to
 upward
 mobility
 through
 the
 mediating
 variable,
racial
 segregation.
 Income
 growth
 adds
 to
 upward
 mobility
 indi-
rectly,
 while
 female-headed
 families
 detract
 from
 upward
 mobility
indirectly.
 The
 Gini
 coefficient,
 which
 represents
 income
 inequality,
is
 unrelated
 to
 upward
 mobility.
 The
 student–teacher
 ratio,
 which
relates
 to
 school
 quality,
 is
 positively
 related
 to
 upward
 mobility,
 a
largely
 unexpected
 result
 (though
 not
 entirely,
 see
 Gladwell,
 2013,
pp.
 55–60).
Direct,
 indirect,
 and
 total
 effects
 of
 variables
 on
 one
 another
are
 shown
 in
 Table
 3.
 The
 net
 indirect
 effect
 of
 compactness
 on
upward
 mobility
 is
 negative
 due
 to
 the
 increase
 in
 income
 seg-
regation
 that
 accompanies
 compactness.
 However,
 the
 indirect
effect
 of
 compactness
 through
 the
 mediating
 variable
 is
 small
 com-
pared
 to
 the
 direct
 effect
 of
 compactness
 on
 upward
 mobility.
Using
 upward
 mobility
 data
 from
 a
 credible
 source,
 and
 a
 validated
compactness/sprawl
 index,
 we
 conclude
 that
 upward
 mobility
is
 significantly
 higher
 in
 compact
 than
 sprawling
 metropolitan
areas/commuting
 zones.
 The
 point
 elasticity
 of
 upward
 mobility
with
 respect
 to
 compactness
 is
 0.41.
 As
 the

 index

bles
 (increases
 by
 100%),
 the
 likelihood
 that
 a
 child
 born
 into
 the
bottom
 fifth
 of

 will
 reach
 the
 top
fifth
 by
 age
 30
 increases

 about
 41%.

 Discussion
 and
 conclusion
Altzinger
 et
 al.
 (2015)
 state
 that
 there
 are
 four
 methods
 that,
 if
utilized
 together,
 would
 be
 effective
 at
 addressing
 social
 mobility
and
 intergenerational
 persistence:
• “Universal
 and
 high-quality
 child
 care
 and
 pre-school
 programs;
• later
 tracking
 and
 more
 access
 to
 vocational
 training,
 with
 a
 focus
on
 avoiding
 skill
 mismatch
 and
 facilitating
 technology
 develop-
ment;
• integration
 programs
 for
 migrants;
• a
 two-pronged
 government
 spending
 approach:
 investment
should
 target
 education
 and
 social
 support
 policies
 at
 the
 same
time.”
 (p.
 26)
To
 these
 we  add
 a
 possible
 fifth
 method,
 implementation
 of
programs
 that
 discourage
 sprawl
 and
 encourage
 compact
 devel-
opment.
In
 our
 paper
 title,
 we
 asked:
 Does
 sprawl
 hold
 down
 upward
mobility?
 Using
 the
 best
 available
 measures
 of
 both
 sprawl
 and
upward
 mobility,
 we
 examined
 potential
 pathways
 through
 which
sprawl
 may
 have
 an
 effect
 on
 mobility.
 Our
 examination
 reveals
that
 sprawl
 has
 an
 effect
 through
 some,
 but
 not
 all,
 of
 the
 posited
causal
 pathways.
Our
 results
 are
 generally
 consistent
 with
 those
 of
 Chetty,
Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 and
Turner
 (2014b),
 who
 looked
 at
 simple
 correlations
 between
 upward
mobility
 and
 seven
 potential
 causal
 factors:
 income
 growth,
 family
structure,
 school
 quality,
 racial
 segregation,
 poverty
 segregation,
social
 capital,
 and
 sprawl
 (represented
 by
 commute
 times).
 Our
results
 indicate
 that
 income
 growth
 has
 a
 direct
 positive
 relation-
ship
 to
 upward
 mobility,
 which
 is
 consistent
 with
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 and
 Turner
(2014b).
 So
 is
 the
 finding
 about
 family
 structure,
 represented
 by
the
 share
 of
 single
 female-headed
 households
 with
 children,
 which
has
 a
 negative
 relationship
 to
 upward
 mobility.
 Racial
 segregation
and
 poverty
 segregation
 also
 have
 strong
 negative
 relationships
 to
upward
 mobility,
 which
 supports
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
(2014a),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 and
 Turner
 (2014b).
 Where
we
 do
 not
 find
 evidence
 of
 significant
 relationships,
 in
 contrast
 to
Chetty
 et
 al.,
 is
 in
 social
 capital
 (represented
 by
 a
 social
 capital
index).
 We  also
 find
 an
 unexpected
 positive
 relationship
 between
the
 student–teacher
 ratio
 and
 upward
 mobility,
 which
 is
 either
 spu-
rious
 or
 an
 indication
 that
 the
 student-teacher
 ratio
 is
 not
 a
 good
measure
 of
 school
 quality.
Most
 important
 are
 the
 relationships
 between
 sprawl
 and
upward
 mobility.
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
 Chetty,
Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 and
 Turner
 (2014b),
 report
 a
 negative
 correla-
tion
 between
 commute
 times,
 their
 proxy
 for
 sprawl,
 and
 upward
mobility.
 We  have
 gone
 a
 step
 further,
 measuring
 sprawl
 explic-
itly
 and
 then
 examining
 both
 direct
 and
 indirect
 causal
 pathways
between
 sprawl,
 as
 measured,
 and
 upward
 mobility.
 The
 direct
effect,
 which
 we
 attribute
 to
 better
 job
 accessibility
 in
 more
 com-
pact
 commuting
 zones,
 is
 stronger
 than
 the
 indirect
 effects.
 Of
 the
indirect
 effects,
 only
 one,
 through
 the
 mediating
 variable
 of
 poverty
segregation,
 is
 significant.
 Commuting
 zones
 with
 high
 levels
 of
compactness
 are,
 in
 fact,
 more
 segregated
 in
 terms
 of
 income,
 and
that
 segregation
 does,
 in
 fact,
 suppress
 upward
 mobility.
We
 would
 like
 to
 acknowledge
 a
 few
 limitations
 of
 this
 study,
which
 provide
 potential
 directions
 for
 future
 research.
 First,
the
 data
 employed
 are
 highly
 aggregated,
 which
 introduces
 the
possibility
 of
 aggregation
 bias.
 Spatial
 inequality
 is
 sensitive
 to
geographical
 scale
 (Wei,
 2015)
 and
 upward
 mobility
 likely
 relates
to
 neighborhood
 circumstances
 (Rothwell
 &
 Massey,
 2015).
 Do
youth,
 for
 example,
 living
 in
 a
 neighborhood
 that
 is
 compact
 and
job
 accessible
 experience
 greater
 upward
 mobility,
 even
 though
their
 metropolitan
 area
 may
 not
 be
 compact?
 Do
 residents
 living
in
 a
 neighborhood
 that
 is
 segregated,
 going
 to
 a
 school
 with
 a
 high
student-teacher
 ratio,
 and
 having
 weak
 ties
 to
 their
 neighbors,
experience
 lower
 upward
 mobility
 even
 though
 the
 metropolitan
area
 as
 a
 whole
 may
 not
 have
 these
 characteristics?
 Due
 to
 the
ecological
 fallacy,
 the
 relationships
 we
 estimate
 at
 the
 aggregate
level
 may
 not
 apply
 to
 individuals.
 Thus,
 we
 would
 recommend
that
 future
 research
 on
 sprawl
 and
 upward
 mobility
 use
 less
highly
 aggregated
 data
 and
 more
 rigorously
 evaluate
 the
 effects
 of
neighborhood
 conditions
 on
 intergenerational
 mobility.
A
 second
 limitation
 of
 this
 study
 is
 that
 the
 measure
 of
 upward
mobility
 developed
 by
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 Saez,
 and
 Turner
 (2014b)
 does
 not
 cap-
ture
 the
 upward
 mobility
 of
 residents
 that
 ascend
 only
 one
 or
 two
income
 quintiles.
 In
 order
 for
 residents
 to
 be
 considered
 upwardly
mobile
 by
 their
 measure,
 they
 must
 move
 from
 the
 lowest
 quintile
to
 the
 highest.
 This
 is
 a
 high
 bar
 to
 achieve.
 Surely,
 many
 resi-
dents
 move
 up
 one,
 two,
 or
 three
 quintiles,
 yet
 our
 study
 does
 not
record
 them
 as
 upwardly
 mobile.
 Comparison
 of
 household
 income
in
 adulthood
 with
 family
 income
 in
 childhood
 has
 also
 been
 used
to
 study
 intergenerational
 mobility.
A
 third
 limitation
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 control
 variables
 used
 in
this
 study.
 As
 a
 follow
 up
 to
 the
 Chetty
 et
 al.
 study,
 we
 used
 the
same
 control
 variables
 as
 they
 did.
 Some
 of
 their
 control
 variables
such
 as
 poverty
 segregation
 and
 racial
 segregation
 are
 computed
by
 Chetty
 and
 his
 team;
 others
 come
 from
 other
 sources
 such
 as
the
 social
 capital
 index
 which
 was
 borrowed
 from
 Rupasingha
 and
Goetz
 (2008).
 We  are
 unable
 to
 confirm
 the
 validity
 and
 reliability
of
 these
 variables
 and
 the
 way
 they
 are
 operationalized.
 More
 con-
trol
 variables
 can
 also
 be
 included
 in
 future
 studies
 so
 that
 more
complete
 sources
 of
 inequality
 could
 be
 revealed.
A
 fourth
 limitation
 relates
 to
 the
 time
 period
 to
 which
 different
variables
 apply.
 Upward
 mobility
 is
 an
 intergenerational
 phe-
nomenon,
 measured
 by
 comparing
 incomes
 of
 parents
 in
 1980–82
to
 their
 children
 in
 2010.
 Most
 of
 the
 independent
 variables
 from
Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
 and
 Saez
 (2014a),
 Chetty,
 Hendren,
 Kline,
Saez,
 and
 Turner
 (2014b)
 are
 measured
 near
 the
 midpoint
 of
 the
period,
 reflecting
 conditions
 when
 the
 children
 were
 teenagers.
 Yet,
the
 compactness
 measure
 used
 to
 operationalize
 sprawl
 applies
 to
the
 end
 of
 the
 period,
 2010.
 This
 isn’t
 necessarily
 where
 the
 chil-
dren
 were
 living
 during
 their
 teenage
 years,
 and
 even
 if
 it
 is,
 the
characteristics
 of
 the
 area
 could
 have
 changed
 somewhat
 between
their
 teenage
 years
 and
 their
 adult
 years.
 We  take
 some
 solace
 in
the
 fact
 that
 urbanized
 areas
 change
 slowly
 over
 time
 (Hamidi
 &
Ewing,
 2014).
Our
 findings
 shed
 light
 on
 the
 built-environmental
 dimension
 of
upward
 mobility.
 Its
 strong
 direct
 relationship
 to
 the
 compactness
index
 carries
 important
 consequences
 for
 planners
 and
 develop-
ment
 strategies.
 Higher
 density/mixed-use
 development
 has
 been
shown
 to
 generate
 incrementally
 more
 jobs,
 higher
 wages,
 eco-
nomic
 resilience,
 and
 lower
 unemployment
 rates,
 all
 of
 which
advance
 upward
 mobility
 (Glaser,
 2011).
Our
 findings
 can
 also
 shed
 light
 on
 international
 comparisons,
which
 are
 clearly
 needed
 to
 better
 understand
 the
 nature
 of
 inter-
generational
 mobility
 and
 the
 effect
 of
 the
 built
 environment.
Income
 mobility
 tends
 to
 be
 higher
 in
 Europe
 especially
 Nordic
countries,
 which
 are
 placed
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 mobility
 ranking,
 than
the
 United
 States
 (e.g.,
 Corak,
 2004;
 Blanden,
 2013),
 and
 studies
 are
needed
 to
 evaluate
 the
 effect
 of
 urban
 form
 and
 built
 environments
since
 European
 cities
 are
 in
 general
 compact
 cities.
 Moreover,
many
 developing
 countries,
 especially
 China,
 are
 undergoing
 rapid
 R.
 Ewing

87
urbanization
 and
 urban
 land
 expansion,
 which
 has
 been
 called
urban
 sprawl
 (Li,
 Wei,
 Liao,
 &
 Huang,
 2015).
 If
 our
 finding
 holds
 true
in
 developing
 countries,
 then
 we
 would
 expect
 cities
 there
 will
 have
increased
 sprawl
 indexes
 and
 declining
 intergenerational
 mobility
over
 time.
 This
 raises
 a
 global
 concern
 for
 equitable
 and
 sustainable
development
 since
 many
 developing
 countries,
 especially
 China
and
 Brazil,
 already
 have
 high-income
 inequality.
 Planners
 in
 both
developed
 and
 developing
 countries
 therefore
 have
 to
 explore
 ways
to
 address
 the
 problems
 of
 intergenerational
 mobility.
While
 aiming
 directly
 for
 upward
 mobility
 can
 appear
 as
 a
 dis-
tant
 target,
 the
 management
 of
 the
 built
 environment
 is
 at
 heart
 of
planners’
 everyday
 agenda.
 Policies
 proposed
 to
 improve
 intergen-
erational
 mobility
 tend
 to
 emphasize
 education
 and
 health
 care
(Corak,
 2013),
 rarely
 considering
 neighborhood
 and
 urban
 form
(Rothwell
 &
 Massey,
 2015).
Our
 study
 invites
 planners
 and
 policymakers
 to
 adopt
 a
 compre-
hensive
 framework
 of
 action
 in
 investing
 in
 urban
 form
 as
 a
 venue
to
 enhance
 upward
 mobility.
 Such
 efforts
 are
 particularly
 important
in
 affordable
 housing
 allocation
 and
 transportation
 investments.
Our
 findings
 suggest
 that
 careful
 consideration
 should
 be
given
 to
 the
 physical
 (compactness
 index
 variable)
 and
 socioeco-
nomic
 landscape
 while
 considering
 locations
 for
 affordable
 housing
projects.
 For
 instance,
 the
 Low-Income
 Housing
 Tax
 Credit
 program
incentivizes
 developers
 to
 locate
 their
 projects
 in
 lowest-income
census
 tracts
 or
 areas
 having
 poverty
 rates
 of
 25%
 or
 more.
 Our
results
 suggest
 that
 careful
 attention
 should
 be
 devoted
 to
 improve
access
 to
 jobs
 and
 avoid
 promoting
 residential
 segregation
 by
 race
or
 income
 (poverty
 and
 racial
 segregation
 variables).
 This
 could
inhibit
 upward
 mobility.
Also
 our
 findings
 suggest
 that
 investments
 in
 our
 transporta-
tion
 systems
 should
 go
 beyond
 functionality
 and
 mobility
 concerns.
Transportation
 infrastructures
 should
 be
 planned
 as
 ‘enablers’.
 The
imperative
 is
 to
 ensure
 a
 sound
 spatial
 coordination
 of
 land-uses
and
 transportation
 infrastructures
 to
 create
 an
 ‘enabling’
 physical
environment
 for
 low
 incomes
 to
 improve
 their
 social
 and
 income
status.
 Planners
 and
 policymakers
 could
 ensure
 that
 the
 develop-
ment/extension
 of
 a
 transit
 line
 is
 best
 leveraged
 by
 supporting
policies
 for
 mixed-use
 development
 and
 not
 furthering
 sprawl.
There
 is
 clearly
 a
 need
 for
 more
 research
 to
 further
 tease
 out
the
 nature
 of
 these
 relationships.
 Nevertheless,
 the
 findings
 of
 this
study
 suggest
 that
 communities
 influence
 the
 chances
 for
 economic
advancement
 of
 the
 people
 who
 live
 there.
 Given
 the
 complexity
of
 the
 relationship,
 more
 planners
 and
 geographers
 should
 engage
in
 the
 study
 of
 intergenerational
 mobility,
 especially
 the
 effects
of
 neighborhood
 and
 urban
 form.
 Urgently
 needed
 are
 also
 inter-
national
 comparative
 studies,
 given
 the
 rapid
 urbanization
 and
emerging
 trend
 of
 urban
 sprawl
 in
 developing
 countries.
