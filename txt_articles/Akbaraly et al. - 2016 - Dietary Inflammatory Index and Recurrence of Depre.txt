Empirical Article
With a prevalence of 350 million people worldwide, 
depression along with other mental health conditions is 
considered to be a major contributor to global disability 
(Whiteford et al., 2013). Despite significant develop-
ments, conventional treatment only addresses one third 
of the disease burden linked to mood disorders (van 
Zoonen et al., 2014). Identifying new preventive strate-
gies (as well as innovative approaches to delay their pro-
gression) thus seems crucial. In recent years, there has 
been an increasing interest in assessing the relationship 
between overall diet and mental health (Lai et al., 2014). 
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis provides a 
comprehensive evaluation of current evidence of the 
association between dietary patterns and depression, 
indicating that a healthy dietary pattern is associated with 
reduced odds of depression (Lai et al., 2014). An increased 
risk of depression associated with a high adherence to 
unhealthy dietary patterns, such as the Western and pro-
cessed food diets, has also been reported (Akbaraly et al., 
2009; Jacka, Cherbuin, Anstey, & Butterworth, 2014; 
Jacka, Mykletun, Berk, Bjelland, & Tell, 2011; Jacka et al., 
2010; Le Port et al., 2012). The epidemiologic evidence 
regarding the potential role of nutrition in depression 
indicates that nutritional medicine could have a place in 
mainstream psychiatric care (Sarris, Logan, Akbaraly,

Abstract
There is a growing interest in understanding the role of inflammation in the diet–depression relationship. The present 
study examined whether the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII; a measure of the inflammatory potential of individuals’ 
diets) is associated with recurrent depressive symptoms (DepS) (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 
score > 16 or taking antidepressants both at baseline and follow-up) assessed over 5 years in middle-aged men (n = 
3,178) and women (n = 1,068) from the Whitehall II Study. For each increment of 1 SD of DII score, odds of recurrent 
DepS increased by 66% (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.30, 2.12]) in women, whereas no significant association 
between DII and recurrent DepS was observed in men (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12; 95% CI = [0.92, 1.36]). This association 
was little attenuated after adjustment for confounders and after taking into account levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive 
protein. In conclusion, there is an association between proinflammatory diet and recurrent DepS in women that seems 
to not be driven by circulating inflammatory markers.

Akbaraly et al.
Amminger et al., 2015) by providing dietary recommen-
dations to prevent depression (Opie et al., 2015). Among 
the biological mechanisms linking diet to depression, 
inflammatory processes have been strongly suggested, 
especially because of the common mechanism shared by 
depression and cardiometabolic disorders (Sanchez-Ville-
gas & Martinez-Gonzalez, 2013).
A cumulative meta-analysis indicated higher levels of 
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in 
patients with major depression compared to nondepres-
sive individuals (Haapakoski, Mathieu, Ebmeier, Alenius, 
& Kivimaki, 2015). Data from observational studies sug-
gest predictive associations of these two inflammatory 
markers with the future development of mood disorders 
(Gimeno et al., 2009; Khandaker, Pearson, Zammit, Lewis, 
& Jones, 2014; Kivimaki et al., 2014; Virtanen et al., 2015; 
Wium-Andersen, Orsted, Nielsen, & Nordestgaard, 2013) 
in a dose–response way (Kivimaki et al., 2014) and a role 
of IL-6 in depressive-like phenotypes (Sukoff Rizzo et al., 
2012). However, few studies have examined the extent to 
which the diet–depression relationship may be directly 
driven by inflammation-modulating properties of the 
specific dietary pattern (and associated foods) assessed. 
To address this limitation, the present study aimed to 
examine whether the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), 
which reflects the proinflammatory potential of diet 
(Shivappa, Steck, Hurley, Hussey, & Hebert, 2014; 
Shivappa, Steck, Hurley, Hussey, Ma et al., 2014), is asso-
ciated with the recurrence of depressive symptoms 
(DepS) assessed over 5 years in a British cohort of men 
and women.
Method
Study population
Participants of the Whitehall II study were London-based 
office staff, aged 35 to 55 years, who worked in 20 civil 
service departments at the study inception (Marmot & 
Brunner, 2005). Baseline screening (Phase 1: 1985–1988, 
n = 10,308) included a clinical examination and a self-
administered questionnaire. Subsequent phases of data 
collection alternated between a clinical examination 
alongside a questionnaire survey (Phase 3: 1991/1993, 
n = 8,815; Phase 5: 1997/1999, n = 7,263; Phase 7: 
2002/2004, n = 6,943; Phase 9: 2007/2009, n = 6,354) and 
a postal questionnaire alone (Phases 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). 
Written informed consent was obtained after a thorough 
explanation of the study to each of the participants; the 
University College London ethics committee approved 
the study.
After excluding participants taking antidepressant 
medications at Phases 3 or 5, analyses were restricted to 
participants with complete data on dietary assessment 
and covariates at Phase 7 and DepS at Phases 7 and 9 
(n = 4,246) as detailed in the flowchart diagram (Fig. 1). 
Baseline and follow-up of this study were represented by 
Phases 7 and 9, respectively.
Data collection
Dietary assessment. Dietary intake of Whitehall II par-
ticipants was assessed using a machine-readable Food 
Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) (Brunner, Stallone, 
Juneja, Bingham, & Marmot, 2001) based on one used in 
the U.S. Nurses’ Health study (Willett et al., 1985). The 
food list (127 items) in the FFQ was anglicized, and foods 
commonly eaten in the United Kingdom were added 
(Bingham et al., 1997). A common unit or portion size for 
each food was specified, and participants were asked 
how often, on average, they had consumed that amount 
of the item during the previous year. Responses to all 
items were based on a 9-point scale, ranging from never 
or less than once per month to six or more times per day. 
The selected frequency category for each food item was 
converted to a daily intake. Nutrient intakes were com-
puted by multiplying the consumption frequency for 
each food by its nutrient content (for specified portions) 
and then summing nutrient contributions from all foods. 
Frequency of consumption for multivitamin supplements 
was also collected. Nutrient values were calculated using 
the computerized system developed for the Whitehall II 
dietary data and based on the 4th and 5th editions of 
McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Foods 
and supplementary tables (Akbaraly et al., 2011). Nutri-
ent supplement information was obtained from manufac-
turers of the supplements and was added to the database. 
The validity and reliability of FFQ in terms of nutrient 
and food consumption have been documented in Bing-
ham et al. (1997).
The DII. The design and development of DII have been 
described elsewhere (Shivappa, Steck, Hurley, Hussey, & 
Hebert, 2014; Shivappa, Steck, Hurley, Hussey, Ma et al., 
2014).Simply put, the DII is a scoring algorithm based on 
a review of the literature published from 1950 to 2010. 
A total of >6,000 articles were scanned, and 1,943 link-
ing one or more of six inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1β, 
IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and CRP) to diet were included 
in the final scoring algorithm. From the 1,943 articles, 
45 food parameters were identified as linked to one or 
more of the inflammatory biomarkers including various 
macronutrients, micronutrients, flavonoids, and individ-
ual food items. The inflammatory potential for each food 
parameter was scored according to whether it increased 
(+1), decreased (–1), or had no effect (0) on six inflam-
matory biomarkers. A z score (mean = 0, SD = 1) for each 
food consumed was calculated by subtracting the “stan-
dard global mean” from the amount reported and divid-
ing this value by its standard deviation. This value was 
 Dietary Inflammatory Index and Depressive Symptoms 
1127
then converted to a centered percentile score in order 
to reduce the risk of skewing. For each food parameter 
and for each participant, this centered percentile score 
was then multiplied by the respective food parameter 
effect score derived from the literature review in order 
to obtain a food parameter-specific DII score for a given 
participant. All of the food parameter-specific DII scores 
were then summed to create the overall DII score for 
each participant in the study. The greater the DII score, 
the more proinflammatory the diet when negative values 
are related to antiinflammatory diets. Details regarding 
the construct validation of DII have been enumerated 
elsewhere (Sanchez-Villegas, Ruiz-Canela et al., 2015). In 
the present study, 27 of 45 food parameters considered 
in the DII score were derived from FFQ and could there-
fore be used to calculate DII. These variables include 
energy, carbohydrate, protein, total fat, alcohol, fiber, 
cholesterol, saturated fat, monounsaturated fatty acid, 
polyunsaturated fatty acid, omega-3, omega-6, transfat, 
niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, iron, 
magnesium, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin 
D, vitamin E, and folic acid.
Assessment of DepS. At baseline and follow-up, par-
ticipants with a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depres-
sion Scale (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977) scores ≥ 16 or being 
treated by antidepressants were defined as “cases”—that 
is, with DepS. Three categories of “5-year DepS status” 
were defined: recurrent DepS, as DepS at both baseline 
and follow-up; nonrecurrent DepS, as DepS once out of 
the two phases; and no DepS, as DepS at none of either 
phase.
Covariates assessed at baseline. Sociodemographic 
factors included sex, age, ethnicity (White, South Asian, 
Black), marital status (married or cohabiting vs. single, 
divorced, or widowed), and socioeconomic status (SES) 
based on occupational position, categorized into three 
groups: high (administrative), intermediate (professional 
or executive), and low (clerical or support). This measure 
is a comprehensive marker of socioeconomic circum-
stances in the Whitehall II study being related to educa-
tion, salary, social status, and level of responsibility at 
work (Marmot & Brunner, 2005).
Health behaviors consisted of smoking, alcohol con-
sumption, total energy intake (estimated from FFQ), and 
physical activity. Smoking status was self-reported and 
was classified as “current smoker” or “noncurrent smoker” 
(including former smokers). Alcohol consumption was 
assessed using questions on the number of alcoholic 
drinks consumed in the past week and was classified 
as “no alcohol consumption in the previous week,”

“moderate alcohol consumption” (1–14 units per week in 
women and 1–21 units per week in men), and “heavy 
drinkers” (15 or more units in women and 21 or more 
units in men). Physical activity was assessed by a ques-
tionnaire including 20 items on frequency and duration 
of participation in different physical activities (e.g., walk-
ing, cycling, sports) that were used to compute hours per 
week at each intensity level. Participants were classified 
as “active” (>2.5 hours per week of moderate physical 
activity or >1 hour per week of vigorous physical activ-
ity), “inactive” (<1 hour per week of moderate physical 
activity and <1 hour per week of vigorous physical activ-
ity), or “moderately active” (if neither active nor inactive) 
(Sabia et al., 2012).
Health status factors included prevalent coronary heart 
disease (CHD) (denoted by clinically verified nonfatal 
myocardial infarction or definite angina), hypertension 
(defined by systolic and diastolic blood pressure ≥140 
and 90 mm Hg, respectively, or use of antihypertensive 
drugs), Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed according to the 
World Health Organization definition), serum high den-
sity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol measured in mmol/L, 
use of lipid-lowering drugs, central obesity defined by a 
waist circumference >102 cm in men and >88 cm in 
women, and cognitive impairment defined by a score of 
≤27 (Crum, Anthony, Bassett, & Folstein, 1993) in the 
Mini Mental State Examination.
Circulating proinflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP 
have been measured. IL-6 was measured using a high-
sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D 
Systems, Oxford, UK) (Gimeno et al., 2007; Gimeno 
et al., 2011). CRP was measured using a high-sensitivity 
immunonephelometric assay in a BN ProSpec nephelom-
eter (Dade Behring, Milton Keynes, UK) (Gimeno et al., 
2007; Gimeno et al., 2011). Blood samples were collected 
between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m., stored at −80 °C, and were 
not thawed or refrozen during storage. Stored serum 
samples were analyzed in the same laboratory. Values

below the detection limit (0.154 mg/L for CRP and 0.08 
pg/mL for IL-6) were assigned a value equal to half the 
detection limit, as detailed elsewhere (Akbaraly et al., 
2015).
Statistical analysis
Characteristics of participants according to recurrent 
DepS status assessed over the 5-year follow-up were 
compared using the Chi-squared test for categorical vari-
ables and Student t tests for continuous variables. Logistic 
regression models were used to assess the association of 
DII score at baseline with recurrent DepS. Nonrecurrent 
DepS and no DepS were considered as noncases. DII 
score was analyzed as a continuous standardized variable 
by using z score (mean = 0, SD = 
1), allowing the odds of 
persistent and nonpersistent DepS per 1 SD increment of 
the considered dietary score to be estimated. DII was 
also categorized into tertiles, and the lowest tertile was 
used as the reference. The medians and ranges were as 
follows: Tertile 1: –1.30 (–3.35, –0.68) (33.5% of men and 
32.7% of women); Tertile 2: –0.19 (–0.68, 0.43) (33.6% of 
men and 32.7% of women); and Tertile 3: 1.35 (0.43, 
4.23) (32.9% of men and 34.6% of women). Models were 
first adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and total energy 
intake (Model 1); then additionally for occupational 
grade, marital status, smoking behavior, physical activity, 
and alcohol consumption (Model 2); and finally for Type 
2 diabetes, stroke, CHD, hypertension, use of lipid-lower-
ing drugs, HDL cholesterol, central obesity, and cognitive 
impairment (Model 3). Similar models were performed in 
which plasma inflammatory markers were additionally 
included as covariates. To examine effect modification, 
interactions between the main covariates and DII score 
regarding DepS have been tested.
Results
Participant characteristics
Of the 6,943 participants alive at Phase 7, 4,246 with 
complete data on DepS over the 5-year follow-up, includ-
ing dietary exposure and covariates at baseline, were 
included in the present analysis. Compared to the 2,697 
participants excluded, those participants that were 
included were more likely to be younger, men, and 
White; have a high SES and healthy behaviors (non-
smoker, high level of physical activity); and were less 
likely to be living alone, have cardiometabolic diseases 
and disorders, and have cognitive impairment (Table SA 
in the Supplemental Material available online).
DII score was computed for the 4,246 participants 
included in the present analyses. The DII was built in a 
way such that the greater the DII score, the more 
potentially proinflammatory the diet. These preliminary 
analyses showed that the DII score was found to be posi-
tively associated with IL-6 and CRP levels categorized in 
tertiles. Participants in the lowest tertiles of both inflam-
matory markers showed lower DII scores (Table SB in the 
Supplemental 
Material). 
Participants’ 
characteristics 
according to DII scores have also been compared (Table 
SC in the Supplemental Material). Higher mean DII scores 
were observed in participants who were male, were South 
Asian, had a low SES, and lived alone. A higher DII score 
was associated with unhealthy behavior and inversely 
associated with total energy intake. Regarding health sta-
tus factors, a high DII score was inversely associated with 
HDL cholesterol, and lower scores were observed in par-
ticipants taking lipid-lowering drugs. No significant asso-
ciation was observed with other health status factors.
Over the 5-year follow-up, 265 (166 men and 99 
women) participants had recurrent DepS (having DepS at 
both baseline and follow-up, 6.2%), 580 (386 men and 
194 women) had DepS in one measurement at baseline 
or follow-up (nonrecurrent DepS, 13.7%), and 3,401 
(2,626 men and 775 women) of the sample did not have 
DepS at either phase (80.1%). Table 1 presents the char-
acteristics of participants according to recurrence of DepS 
in the whole sample and by gender separately. Partici-
pants with recurrent DepS were more likely to be women, 
younger, South Asian, of a low SES, and living alone. 
They were more likely to be a current smoker, an alcohol 
abstainer, physically inactive, of central obesity, and liv-
ing with CHDs and cognitive impairment. Similar charac-
teristics associated with recurrent DepS were observed 
for each sex.
DII and recurrent DepS over the 5-year 
follow-up
Means (SD) and ranges of DII were −0.03 (1.3) and −3.35 
to 4.23 in men and −0.002 (1.4) and −3.35 to 3.98 in 
women. Logistic regression models were performed to 
estimate the associations between DII score and recur-
rent DepS. Interactions between covariates and DII score 
have been tested, and a marginally significant interaction 
was observed for sex (p < .056 for sex interaction), lead-
ing us to conduct analyses in men and women 
separately.
After adjusting for age, total energy intake, and ethnic-
ity, a significant association between high DII scores 
(reflecting proinflammatory potential of diet) and increased 
odds of recurrent DepS was observed in women but not in 
men. For each increment of 1 SD of the DII score, odds of 
recurrent DepS increased by 66% (95% CI = [1.30, 2.12]) in 
women, whereas no significant association between DII 
and recurrent DepS was observed in men (odds ratio 
[OR] =1.12, 95% CI = [0.92, 1.36]). Analyses in which the

 Dietary Inflammatory Index and Depressive Symptoms 
1131
DII was categorized in tertiles (Figure 2) showed that 
women in the highest DII third were more likely to have 
recurrent DepS over the 5-year follow-up compared to 
women in the lowest third (Figure 2, Model 1; OR = 3.29, 
95% CI = [1.76, 6.14]). Further adjustment for occupational 
grade, marital status, smoking behavior, physical activity, 
and alcohol consumption (Figure 2, Model 2) and for Type 
2 diabetes, stroke, CHD, hypertension, use of lipid-lower-
ing drugs, HDL cholesterol, central obesity, and cognitive 
impairment (Figure 2, Model 3) did not substantially atten-
uate the results. After full adjustment, the odds of subse-
quent recurrent DepS over the 5-year follow-up in women 
in the top tertile compared to those in the bottom tertile 
was 2.83 (95% CI = [1.48, 5.42]). No significant association 
between tertiles of DII and recurrent DepS was found in 
men (Figure 2). We repeated the analyses in which sex-
specific tertiles of DII were computed. Similar results were 
obtained. Additionally, instead of considering tertiles of 
DII, we assessed the DII–recurrent DepS associations by 
considering quintiles of DII, and similar trends were 
observed.
The role of circulating inflammatory 
markers
To assess the extent through which association between 
DII and recurrent DepS is explained by circulatory 
inflammatory markers—IL-6 and CRP—measured at 
baseline, the main analyses were repeated after entering 
these two inflammatory markers in the models. Analyses 
were performed on data from participants for whom 
measures of these inflammatory markers were available. 
After exclusion of cases with possible acute inflammation 
and immune activation due to current illness (defined as 
having CRP values >10 pg/mL), assessable data were 
available from a total of 3,749 participants (2,848 men 
and 901 women). The additional adjustment for IL-6 and 
CRP had little effect on results, as we obtained similar 
associations between DII and recurrent DepS as those 
reported in the main analyses. This was the case in analy-
ses stratified by sex and irrespective of the level of adjust-
ments. For example, in the total cohort, the multivariate 
adjusted OR for the DII z score and recurrent DepS was 
1.22 before and 1.21 after the additional adjustment for 
IL-6 and CRP. These results suggest that markers of 
inflammation are not shaping the association between 
DII and recurrent DepS.
Discussion
In this longitudinal study, we assessed the association 
between DII—a dietary index designed to assess the pro-
inflammatory potential of overall diet—and recurrence of 
DepS in a large cohort of British men and women. In this 
analysis from the Whitehall II study, we showed a sex-
specific association between DII and recurrent DepS. 
Although no significant association was found in men, 
women with the highest DII score (representing a diet 
with high proinflammatory potential) were more likely to 
develop recurrent DepS over the 5-year follow-up. We 
showed that these associations were little attenuated after 
adjustment for a large range of socioeconomic variables, 
lifestyle habits, cardiometabolic risk factors, and cogni-
tive impairment. Our findings add a supplementary argu-
ment to the presupposed role of inflammatory processes 
in the diet–depression relationship.
The inverse association between DII and recurrence of 
DepS observed concurs with results found in other analy-
ses assessing the association between overall diet, DepS, 
and DepS and depression. In several reports, including 
our previous work, an increased risk of depression/DepS 
was observed in participants showing a high adherence 
to Western or processed food dietary patterns (Akbaraly 
et al., 2009; Jacka et al., 2014; Le Port et al., 2012) and in 
those with low adherence to prudent or traditional (Lai 
et al., 2014) dietary patterns, whereas a reduced risk of 
depression was associated with diets with high diet qual-
ity scores, including the Mediterranean diet (Sanchez-
Villegas, Henriquez-Sanchez et al., 2015) and Alternative 
Healthy Eating Index (Akbaraly, Sabia, Shipley, Batty, & 
Kivimaki, 2013). The anti- and proinflammatory proper-
ties of specific foods or nutrients included in healthy and 
unhealthy diets, respectively, have been proposed as 
potential explanations linking overall diet to depression.
However, little evidence is available on the extent to 
which the anti- or proinflammatory potential of diet 
shapes the association between diet and depression. To 
date, two cohort studies have assessed the association 
between dietary patterns linked to inflammation and 
depression. One derived dietary patterns related to 
inflammatory markers in American women (Lucas et al., 
2014) and the other used DII in a Spanish population 
(Sanchez-Villegas, Ruiz-Canela et al., 2015). Both showed 
an association with incident depression. In the present 
study, which also used DII, we found a similar positive 
association with recurrent DepS.
Additionally, we found that DII was positively associ-
ated with IL-6 and CRP levels at baseline, making our 
results compatible with the hypothesis of the involve-
ment of inflammatory process in the diet–depression 
relationship. However, it is interesting to note that adjust-
ment for IL-6 and CRP did not yield a material change in 
the estimate of the DII–DepS recurrence association. 
There are several possible explanations for this finding. 
One explanation is that DII might not sufficiently capture 
the inflammatory properties of a diet in Whitehall II par-
ticipants. It is also possible that the direct effect of diet-
related inflammation is not entirely mediated by CRP or 
 1132 
Akbaraly et al.
IL-6. Also, both CRP and IL-6 are subject to fluctuations 
in measurements, and levels may be affected by short-
term disturbances in the metabolic milieu. Further inves-
tigations assessing the extent to which DII is a proxy 
measure of inflammatory activity in the present cohort is 
needed to fully interpret our findings and whose conclu-
sion is compatible with the multifactorial nature of mech-
anisms (and not only inflammatory pathways) linking 
overall diet to depression processes.
The association between DII and DepS yielded signifi-
cance for women but not men. A similar sex difference 
was also observed in previous analyses assessing the 
association between adherence to the Alternative Healthy 
Eating Index and recurrent DepS in the Whitehall II study 
(Akbaraly et al., 2013). This contrasts with findings from 
the Seguimiento University of Navarra (SUN) cohort in 
which the DII–depression association was observed in 
both sexes. Further research is needed to determine 
whether sex differences in the diet–depression relation-
ship are real or attributable to methodological limitations 
in assessing male depression. Indeed, some CES-D items 
(the measure used in this study) have been shown to 
produce biased responses when comparing male and 
female respondents (Stommel et al., 1993).
Our study has limitations. First, even if the CES-D scale 
has been shown to be a reliable and valid measurement 
tool indicating the presence of DepS (St John, Blandford, 
& Strain, 2006), it does not capture the severity of DepS. 
We sought to take into account this limitation by focusing 
on recurrent DepS episodes, which are defined as partici-
pants who met the CES-D criteria at two consecutive 
measurements. Nevertheless, our results cannot be 
extended to major depression. Second, the methodologi-
cal design did not allow us to clearly separate recurrent 
from chronic depression. However, from the current epi-
demiological data about depression, we can infer that 
chronic states were restricted to a minority of the partici-
pants (Blanco et al., 2010). Third, our study was limited 
by the assessment of dietary intake. We used a semiquan-
titative FFQ that covers only specific foods, which we 
recognize as less precise than dietary assessments by 
diary records. FFQ has been showed to be associated 
with a variety of measurement biases in some studies 
(Hebert, Clemow, Pbert, Ockene, & Ockene, 1995; Hebert 
et al., 2002; Hebert et al., 1997; Hebert et al., 2001). More-
over, the extent to which our results are generalizable is 
an important consideration. Whitehall II study partici-
pants are mainly White, office-based civil servants, and 
not fully representative of the British general population 
(Marmot & Brunner, 2005). Furthermore the present anal-
ysis was carried out on participants without any missing 
value on depression outcomes, dietary exposures, 
and other covariates. Finally, even with the prospective 
design and after excluding participants undergoing 
antidepressant treatment before measuring the exposure, 
the possibility remains that a high DII score could be the 
consequence, rather than the cause, of DepS.
Despite these limitations, our results confirm an associa-
tion between a high DII score and onset of recurrent DepS 
at least in women in a large British population. We also 
found this association to be largely independent of plasma 
levels of inflammatory markers, suggesting that further 
research is needed to identify the exact biological mecha-
nisms underlying the DII–recurrent DepS association.
