Health of the Public and Science of the American Academy of Family Physicians*
Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) jointly devel-
oped this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical
recommendations based on the benefits and harms of higher
versus lower blood pressure targets for the treatment of hyper-
tension in adults aged 60 years or older.
Methods: This guideline is based on a systematic review of pub-
lished randomized, controlled trials for primary outcomes and
observational
studies
for
harms
only
(identified
through
EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MED-
LINE, and ClinicalTrials.gov), from database inception through
January 2015. The MEDLINE search was updated through Sep-
tember 2016. Evaluated outcomes included all-cause mortality,
morbidity and mortality related to stroke, major cardiac events
(fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac
death), and harms. This guideline grades the evidence and rec-
ommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) method.
Target Audience and Patient Population: The target audi-
ence for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target pa-
tient population includes all adults aged 60 years or older with
hypertension.
Recommendation 1: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians
initiate treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with systolic
blood pressure persistently at or above 150 mm Hg to achieve a
target systolic blood pressure of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce
the risk for stroke, cardiac events, and possibly mortality. (Grade:
strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP
recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults
aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the
benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the
patient.
Recommendation 2: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians
consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in
adults aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient
ischemic attack to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less
than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke. (Grade:
weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). ACP and
AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for
adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of
the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the
patient.
Recommendation 3: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians
consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in
some adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk,
based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic
blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg. (Grade: weak recom-
mendation, low-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend
that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years
or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms
of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

ypertension, an elevation of systemic arterial blood
pressure (BP), is a very common chronic disease in
the United States. The overall prevalence of hyperten-
sion among U.S. adults is 29.0%, and it increases to
64.9% in adults aged 60 years or older (1). Hyperten-
sion was associated with a total of $46 billion in health
care services, medications, and missed days of work in
the United States in 2011 (2).

 Appropriate management of hypertension reduces
the risk for cardiovascular disease, renal disease, cere-
brovascular disease, and death (3–6). However, deter-
mining the most appropriate BP targets, particularly for
adults aged 60 years or older, has been controversial.
Debate about the goal for systolic BP (SBP) among
adults treated for hypertension has intensified, espe-
cially in light of recent recommendations (7). In addi-
tion, when selecting BP targets for adults aged 60 years
or older, clinicians need to consider comorbid condi-
tions that could affect treatment choice. Treatments for
hypertension include lifestyle modifications, such as
weight loss, dietary modification, and increased physi-
cal activity, and antihypertensive medications, which
commonly include thiazide-type diuretics, angiotensin-
converting
enzyme
inhibitors
(ACEIs),
angiotensin-
receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium-channel blockers,
and �-blockers.
GUIDELINE FOCUS AND TARGET POPULATION
The purpose of this American College of Physicians
(ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians
(AAFP) joint guideline is to present evidence-based
recommendations on the benefits and harms of higher
(<150 mm Hg) versus lower (≤140 mm Hg) SBP targets
for the treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60
years or older. The target audience for this guideline
includes all clinicians, and the target patient population
includes adults aged 60 years or older with hyperten-
sion. These recommendations are based on a back-
ground evidence review (8) and systematic review
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) (9).
METHODS
Systematic Review of the Evidence
The evidence review was conducted by the Port-
land VA Health Care System Evidence-based Synthesis
Program. The summary of methods for the evidence
review can be found in the Appendix (available at An-
nals.org). Additional details are included in the accom-
panying background evidence review (8) and the full
evidence report (9).
Grading the Evidence and Developing
Recommendations
This guideline was jointly developed by ACP'
s Clin-
ical Guidelines Committee and representatives from
AAFP according to ACP'
s guideline development pro-
cess, details of which can be found in the methods pa-
per (10). The committee used the evidence tables in
the accompanying systematic review (8) and full report
(9) when reporting the evidence and graded the rec-
ommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recom-
mendations Assessment, Development, and Evalua-
tion) method (Table).
Peer Review
The VA evidence review was peer reviewed and
posted on the VA Web site for public comments, and
the published review article was peer reviewed through
the journal. The guideline had a peer-review process
through the journal and was posted online for com-
ments from ACP Regents and Governors, who repre-
sent physician members at the national and interna-
tional level. The guideline was also reviewed by
members of AAFP'
s Commission on Health of the Pub-
lic and Science.
BENEFITS OF TREATING HIGHER VERSUS
LOWER BP TARGETS IN OLDER ADULTS
Across all trials, treating high BP in older adults was
beneficial. However, most of the evidence came from
studies of patients with moderate or severe hyperten-
sion (SBP >160 mm Hg) at baseline and, with treatment,
achieved SBP targets greater than 140 mm Hg.
Differing BP Targets
Moderate-quality evidence showed a reduction in
all-cause mortality among patients with a baseline SBP
of 160 mm Hg or greater who achieved a target SBP of
less than 150 mm Hg, although the reductions did not
quite reach statistical significance (relative risk [RR],
0.93 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00]; absolute risk reduction
[ARR], 1.13). High-quality evidence showed reductions
in stroke (RR, 0.77 [CI, 0.64 to 0.91]; ARR, 0.92), and
cardiac events (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.96]; ARR, 0.72)
(11–21).
In studies with lower SBP targets (<140 mm Hg),
low-quality evidence showed no statistically significant
reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.75 to
1.14]; ARR, 0.21), cardiac events (RR, 0.91 [CI, 0.77 to
1.04]; ARR, 0.35), or stroke (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.64 to 0.1.07];
ARR, 0.19) compared with higher BP targets (11–13, 20,
22, 23). Many of these studies, however, did not
achieve the targeted BP, and there was little difference
in BP between the intensive treatment and control
groups. Therefore, these studies may not have been
able to detect differences in clinical outcomes.

 20, 22–25). For these subgroups, high-quality evidence
showed a similar risk reduction for mortality (RR for tar-
get ≥140 mm Hg, 0.91 [CI, 0.84 to 0.99] vs. RR for tar-
get <140 mm Hg, 0.84 [CI, 0.74 to 0.95]) and cardiac
events (RR for target ≥140 mm Hg, 0.78 [CI, 0.68 to
0.93] vs. RR for target <140 mm Hg, 0.83 [CI, 0.70 to
0.94]). The relative reduction in stroke events was
slightly larger for studies that achieved a target SBP of
140 mm Hg or greater (RR, 0.72 [CI, 0.62 to 0.82]) than
those that achieved a target SBP of less than 140 mm
Hg (RR, 0.81 [CI, 0.66 to 0.96]). These studies had
marked clinical differences and significant statistical
heterogeneity, which should temper confidence in the
pooled results. Use of antihypertensive agents varied
widely across studies: 7 used ACEIs or ARBs, 5 used
calcium-channel blockers, and 6 used thiazide-like
diuretics.
Differing BP Targets in Patients With Transient
Ischemic Attack or Stroke
Among patients with a history of stroke or transient
ischemic
attack
(TIA),
moderate-quality
evidence
showed that treating to an SBP of 130 to 140 mm Hg
reduced stroke recurrence (RR, 0.76 [CI, 0.66 to 0.92];
ARR, 3.02) but not cardiac events (RR, 0.78 [CI, 0.61 to
1.08]) or all-cause mortality (RR, 0.98 [CI, 0.85 to 1.19])
(26, 27). Heterogeneity for this analysis was low.
Differing BP Targets Based on Age
Low-quality evidence showed similar effects across
different age groups (12–14, 16, 18–20, 22, 24, 26, 28,
29). A subgroup analysis of SPRINT (Systolic Blood
Pressure Intervention Trial) that was not included in the
evidence review showed that patients aged 75 years or
older had lower all-cause mortality and nonstatistically
significantly lower cardiovascular mortality, morbidity,
and incidence of stroke with treatment to SBP targets
less than 120 mm Hg compared with SBP targets less
than 140 mm Hg (30).
Differing BP Targets Based on Multiple Chronic
Conditions
No trials assessed the effect of comorbidity on the
benefits of more aggressive BP treatment. Low-quality
evidence from subgroup analyses showed greater ab-
solute benefit from more intensive BP treatment in pa-
tients with high cardiovascular risk (22, 29–31). How-
ever, patients with a high comorbidity burden were
probably not included in the overall group of studies
(8). Of the 21 trials included in the review, 14 excluded
patients with heart failure, 11 excluded those with re-
cent cardiovascular events, 17 excluded those with ab-
normal renal function, 12 excluded those with cancer or
other life-limiting illness, 15 had criteria that would im-
plicitly or explicitly exclude those with dementia or di-
minished functional status, and 7 excluded either all
diabetic patients or those who required insulin. Al-
though findings from ACCORD (Action to Control Car-
diovascular Risk in Diabetes), which limited enrollment
to patients with type 2 diabetes, found no reduction in
mortality or major cardiovascular events with more in-
tensive treatment, a subgroup analysis of 7 studies (12,
14, 18–20, 28, 29) in diabetic patients suggested that
they were at least as likely to benefit from BP-lowering
treatment. This is probably related to the higher fre-
quency of cardiovascular events seen in these patients.
Treatment Effects According to Diastolic BP
Evidence was insufficient to determine the benefit
of treating diastolic hypertension in the absence of sys-
tolic hypertension. Most trials assessed treatment out-
comes based on SBP, and no trials included patients
with a mean diastolic BP (DBP) greater than 90 mm Hg
and a mean SBP less than 140 mm Hg.
HARMS OF HIGHER VERSUS LOWER BP
TARGETS IN OLDER ADULTS
Studies showed mixed findings for withdrawal due
to adverse events. Treatment to lower BP targets in-
creased withdrawals due to adverse events in 4 out of
10 trials (RR, 44% to 100%); cough and hypotension
were the most frequently reported adverse events (13,
15, 17, 18, 20, 24, 27, 29, 31, 32). Low-quality evidence
showed an increased risk for syncope associated with
treatment to lower BP targets (achieved SBP range,
121.5 to 143 mm Hg) (RR, 1.52 [CI, 1.22 to 2.07]) (18,
23, 28). Low-quality evidence showed no difference in
renal outcomes (including end-stage renal disease) for
treatment to higher versus lower BP targets (13, 15, 16,
18, 20, 22–25, 28, 29, 32–34). Moderate-quality evi-
dence showed no differences between treatment to
higher versus lower BP targets in the degree of cogni-
tive decline or dementia (18, 27, 35–39), fractures (40,
41), or quality of life (17, 42–44). Low-quality evidence
showed no difference for treatment to higher versus
lower BP targets on functional status (42) or the risk for
falls (23, 40). A subgroup analysis of SPRINT showed a
nonstatistically significant increase in the rate of serious
adverse events, hypotension, syncope, electrolyte ab-
normalities, or acute kidney injury in patients aged 75
years or older who were treated to SBP targets less
than 120 mm Hg versus SBP targets less than 140 mm
Hg (28).
Although electrolyte disturbances are a common
adverse effect of hypertension treatment in clinical
practice, data were not presented on these abnormali-
ties in the evidence review. Drugs to treat hypertension
have well-known adverse effects, including hypokale-
mia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, dizzi-
ness,
headache,
edema,
erectile
dysfunction,
and
cough.
Effect of Age
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in ad-
verse events, including unsteadiness, dizziness, and re-
nal failure, in patients younger or older than 75 years
(13, 23, 28).
Effect of Multiple Chronic Conditions
No trials assessed the effect of comorbid condi-
tions on harms.

 RECOMMENDATIONS
The Figure summarizes the recommendations and
clinical considerations.
Recommendation 1: ACP and AAFP recommend
that clinicians initiate treatment in adults aged 60 years
or older with systolic blood pressure persistently at or
above 150 mm Hg to achieve a target systolic blood
pressure of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce the risk for
stroke, cardiac events, and possibly mortality. (Grade:
strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). ACP
and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treat-
ment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a
periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific
blood pressure targets with the patient.
High-quality evidence showed that treating hyper-
tension in older adults to moderate targets (<150/90
mm Hg) reduces stroke (ARR, 0.92) and cardiac events
(ARR, 0.72). Moderate-quality evidence showed a pos-
sible reduction in mortality, however, the results did not
quite achieve statistical significance (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.85
to 1.00]). Most benefits apply to all adults regardless of
whether they have diabetes. We rated the overall evi-
dence as high because effects were favorable across
outcomes and the reduction in mortality was nearly sta-
tistically significant. The most consistent and greatest
absolute benefit was shown in trials with a higher mean
SBP at baseline (>160 mm Hg). Any additional benefit
from aggressive BP control is small, with a lower mag-
nitude of benefit and inconsistent results across out-
comes.
Although this guideline did not specifically address
pharmacologic versus nonpharmacologic treatments
for hypertension, several nonpharmacologic treatment
strategies are available for consideration. Effective non-
pharmacologic options for reducing BP include such
lifestyle modifications as weight loss, such dietary
changes as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hy-
pertension) diet, and an increase in physical activity.
Nonpharmacologic options are typically associated
with fewer side effects than pharmacologic therapies
and have other positive effects; ideally, they are in-
cluded as the first therapy or used concurrently with
drug therapy for most patients with hypertension. Ef-
fective pharmacologic options include antihypertensive
medications, such as thiazide-type diuretics (adverse
effects include electrolyte disturbances, gastrointesti-
nal discomfort, rashes and other allergic reactions,
sexual dysfunction in men, photosensitivity reactions,
and orthostatic hypotension), ACEIs (adverse effects
include cough and hyperkalemia), ARBs (adverse ef-
fects include dizziness, cough, and hyperkalemia),
calcium-channel blockers (adverse effects include
dizziness, headache, edema, and constipation), and
�-blockers (adverse effects include fatigue and sex-
ual dysfunction).
Most of the included studies measured seated BP
after 5 minutes of rest and used multiple readings. Cli-
nicians should ensure that they are accurately measur-
ing BP before beginning or changing treatment of
hypertension. Assessment may include multiple mea-
surements in clinical settings (for example, 2 to 3 read-
ings separated by 1 minute in a seated patient who is
resting alone in a room) or ambulatory or home
monitoring (45).
Recommendation 2: ACP and AAFP recommend
that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharma-
cologic treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with
a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to achieve
a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg
to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke. (Grade: weak
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). ACP and
AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment
goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a pe-
riodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific
blood pressure targets with the patient.
Moderate-quality evidence showed that treating
hypertension in older adults with previous TIA or stroke
to an SBP target of 130 to 140 mm Hg reduces stroke
recurrence (ARR, 3.02) compared with treatment to
higher targets, with no statistically significant effect on
cardiac events or all-cause mortality.
Recommendation 3: ACP and AAFP recommend
that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharma-
cologic treatment in some adults aged 60 years or older
at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized as-
sessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of
less than 140 mm Hg. (Grade: weak recommendation,
low-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that
clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60
years or older based on a periodic discussion of the
benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets
with the patient.
An SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg is a reason-
able goal for some patients with increased cardio-
vascular risk. While pooled estimates of all studies
demonstrated no statistically significant reductions in
mortality, cardiac events, or stroke a single large, high
quality study (SPRINT) did find benefits across all out-
comes in high risk individuals without diabetes. The tar-
get depends on many factors unique to each patient,
including comorbidity, medication burden, risk for ad-
verse events, and cost. Clinicians should individually as-
sess cardiovascular risk for patients. Generally, in-
creased
cardiovascular
risk
includes
persons
with
known vascular disease, most patients with diabetes,
older persons with chronic kidney disease with esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate less than 45 mL/min/
per 1.73 m2, those with metabolic syndrome (abdomi-
nal obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia),
and older persons. Among the included studies,
SPRINT (23) defined patients with increased cardiovas-
cular risk as those meeting at least 1 of the following
criteria: clinical or subclinical cardiovascular disease
other than stroke; chronic kidney disease, excluding
polycystic kidney disease, with an estimated glomerular
filtration rate of 20 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 of
body surface area; 10-year risk for cardiovascular dis-
ease of 15% or greater based on the Framingham risk
score; or age 75 years or older. This trial found that

Recommendations
Recommendation 1: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians initiate treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with systolic 
blood pressure persistently at or above 150 mm Hg to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce 
the risk for stroke, cardiac events, and possibly mortality. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP 
recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the

adults aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of 
less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke. (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). ACP 
and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion 
of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.
Recommendation 3: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in 
some adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic 
blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that 
clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of 
specific blood pressure targets with the patient.
Clinical Considerations
Accurate measurement of BP is important before initiating treatment for hypertension. Some patients may have elevated BP in clinical settings, 
and ambulatory measurement may be appropriate.
Clinicians should consider treatment with nonpharmacologic options, including weight loss, dietary changes, and an increase in physical 
activity, initially or concurrently with pharmacologic treatment.
Many older adults may be taking various medications. Clinicians should consider treatment burden and drug interactions when deciding on 
treatment options.
When selecting pharmacologic therapy, clinicians should prescribe generic drugs where available.
Evidence for adults who are frail or those with multimorbidity is limited.

 stroke, at high-risk for cardiovascular disease, and with
a baseline SBP of less than 140 mm Hg significantly
reduced fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and
all-cause mortality. In contrast, ACCORD (40) included
only adults with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular
risk and found no statistically significant reduction in
the primary composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial
infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular
events (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.80 to 1.11]). This study did find a
reduction in stroke events (RR, 0.58 [CI, 0.39 to 0.88]),
but there were more serious adverse events associated
with an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg versus less
than 140 mm Hg. In light of the low-quality evidence of
no statistically significant reduction in mortality, cardiac
events, or stroke from pooled estimates from all stud-
ies, but benefit shown by SPRINT, as well as the known
harms, burden, and costs of more intensive pharmaco-
logical therapy, an individualized assessment is impor-
tant to evaluate the benefit of lower blood pressure
targets relative to harms in patients age 60 years and
older.
AREAS OF INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE
Treatment of Patients With Multiple Chronic
Conditions
No trials assessed the relationship between multi-
ple comorbid conditions and the benefits and harms of
treating BP to different targets. Patients with a high co-
morbidity burden were probably not included in the
overall group of studies. Many studies excluded pa-
tients with various comorbid conditions, such as diabe-
tes, insulin use, recent coronary events, heart failure, or
chronic kidney disease, and most studies had criteria
that would implicitly or explicitly exclude those with de-
mentia or diminished functional status.
Treating According to DBP
Evidence was insufficient for targeting treatment
according to DBP.
MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS: CLINICAL
CONSIDERATIONS FOR ADULTS AGED 60 YEARS
OR OLDER
Individual assessment of benefits and harms is par-
ticularly important in adults aged 60 years or older with
multiple chronic conditions, several medications, or
frailty. These patients might theoretically benefit from
more aggressive BP treatment because of higher car-
diovascular risks. However, they are more likely to be
susceptible to serious harm from higher rates of syn-
cope and hypotension, which were seen in some trials.
Moreover, the absolute benefits of more aggressive BP
treatment in elderly persons, those with multimorbidity,
or those who are frail are not well-known, given limita-
tions of the trials. These patients often receive multiple
medications and are on drug regimens that are difficult
to manage and increase the cost and risk for drug in-
teractions. Indeed, most trials had exclusion criteria
that implicitly or explicitly excluded patients who had
dementia or diminished functional status. Few trials
were available to compare patients with and without
diabetes, which made drawing conclusions about rela-
tive treatment effects in these populations difficult.
Whether the difference in results between SPRINT and
ACCORD was because of diabetes status is unclear, but
it is reasonable to rationalize that the benefits observed
with the lower targets achieved in SPRINT most closely
apply to patient populations without diabetes.
HIGH-VALUE CARE
Most patients aged 60 years or older with an SBP of
150 mm Hg or greater who receive antihypertensive
medications will have benefit with acceptable harms
and costs from treatment to a BP target of less than
150/90 mm Hg. Although some benefit is achieved by
aiming for lower BP targets, in some patients most ben-
efit occurs with acceptable harms and costs in the phar-
macologic treatment of patients who have an SBP of
150 mm Hg or greater. When prescribing drug therapy,
clinicians
should
select
generic
formulations
over
brand-name drugs, which have similar efficacy, re-
duced cost, and therefore better adherence (46). Clini-
cians should consider the patient'
s treatment burden
when deciding on treatment options. Studies have cor-
related multiple doses of hypertensive medications
with poorer medication adherence (47, 48). The bal-
ance of benefits and harms identified in our evidence
report is based in part on rigorous and accurate assess-
ment of BP. Some patients may have falsely elevated
readings in clinical settings (known as “white-coat hy-
pertension”). Therefore, it is important to ensure accu-
rate BP measurement before initiating or changing
treatment of hypertension. The most accurate measure-
ments come from multiple BP measurements made
over time.

APPENDIX: DETAILED METHODS
The evidence review was conducted by the Port-
land VA Health Care System Evidence-based Synthesis
Program to address the following key questions (KQs):
KQ 1: In adults aged 60 years or older, what are the
health outcome effects of differing BP targets?
KQ 1b: In patients who have suffered a TIA or
stroke, does treatment of BP to specific targets affect
health outcomes?
KQ 2: How does age modify the benefits of differ-
ing BP targets?
KQ 3: How does the patient burden of comorbid
conditions modify the benefits of differing BP targets?
KQ 4: What are the harms of targeting lower BP in
older patients? Do the harms vary with age?
KQ 5: Do the harms of targeting lower BP vary with
patient burden of comorbid conditions?
Search Strategy
The
reviewers
searched
EMBASE
and
the
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from data-
base
inception
through
January
2015,
MEDLINE
through September 2016, and ClinicalTrials.gov to
identify studies that were in progress or unpublished.
Observational studies were excluded from analysis of
such health outcomes as mortality, stroke, and cardio-
vascular events. For additional information, including
inclusion and exclusion criteria, refer to the accompa-
nying article (8) and full report (9).
Meta-analysis and Individual-Patient Data
Meta-analysis
The reviewers conducted a meta-analysis on study-
level data using the random-effects model. They also
conducted individual-patient data meta-analysis to as-
sess treatment according to age subgroups.
Quality Assessment
The quality of studies was assessed using the Co-
chrane risk-of-bias tool (49). The evidence reviewers
graded the quality of evidence using the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality system (50).
Population
Adults aged 60 years or older with a diagnosis of
hypertension were studied.
Interventions Evaluated
The interventions evaluated included treatment to
higher (<150 mm Hg) versus lower (≤140 mm Hg) SBP
targets.
Comparators
The comparator was less intensive BP treatment.
Outcomes
Evaluated outcomes included all-cause mortality;
cardiac events (myocardial infarction and sudden car-
diac death); morbidity and mortality related to stroke;
and harms, including cognitive impairment, quality of
life, falls, fractures, syncope, functional status, hypoten-
sion, acute kidney injury (defined as the doubling of
serum creatinine or need for renal replacement ther-
apy), medication burden, and withdrawal due to ad-
verse events.
Timing
Outcomes were assessed in the long-term (>6
months) for KQs 1, 2, and 3 and any time frame for KQs
4 and 5.
Study Design
Controlled study designs (randomized, controlled
trials and nonrandomized, controlled trials) (KQs 1, 2, 3,
4 and 5) and cohort studies (KQs 4 and 5) were in-
cluded. Case reports; case series; randomized, con-
trolled trials with less than 6-month follow-up; and con-
trolled before–after studies were excluded.
Peer Review
The VA evidence review was sent to invited peer
reviewers and posted on the VA Web site for public
comments, and the published review article was peer
reviewed through the journal. The guideline had a

 CORRECTION: PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION
IN ADULTS AGED 60 YEARS OR OLDER TO HIGHER VERSUS
LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE TARGETS
A recent guideline (1) was based on a review (2) that
contained errors. The following changes have been made:
Recommendation 1 now reads as follows: “ACP and
AAFP recommend that clinicians initiate treatment in adults
aged 60 years or older with systolic blood pressure persis-
tently at or above 150 mm Hg to achieve a target systolic
blood pressure of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce the risk for
stroke, cardiac events, and possibly mortality. (Grade: strong
recommendation, high-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP rec-
ommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults
aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the
benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the
patient.”
The original wording of the first sentence of that recommen-
dation was “. . . to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of
less than 150 mm Hg to reduce the risk for mortality, stroke,
and cardiac events.”
Recommendation 3 now reads as follows: “ACP and
AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensi-
fying pharmacologic treatment in some adults aged 60 years
or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized
assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less
than 140 mm Hg. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality
evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select
the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based
on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific
blood pressure targets with the patient.”
The original wording of that recommendation was “ACP and
AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensi-
fying pharmacologic treatment in some adults aged 60 years
or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized
assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less
than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke or cardiac
events.”
The first 2 paragraphs under the heading, “Differing BP
Targets,” now read as follows: “Moderate-quality evidence
showed a reduction in all-cause mortality among patients with
a baseline SBP of 160 mm Hg or greater who achieved a
target SBP of less than 150 mm Hg, although the reductions
did not quite reach statistical significance (relative risk [RR],
0.93 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00]; absolute risk reduction [ARR],
1.13). High-quality evidence showed reductions in stroke (RR,
0.77 [CI, 0.64 to 0.91]; ARR, 0.92), and cardiac events (RR, 0.83
[CI, 0.71 to 0.96]; ARR, 0.72) (11–21).”
In studies with lower SBP targets (<140 mm Hg), low-
quality evidence showed no statistically significant reduction
in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.75 to 1.14]; ARR,
0.21),cardiac events (RR, 0.91 [CI, 0.77 to 1.04]; ARR, 0.35),or
stroke (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.64 to 0.1.07]; ARR, 0.19) compared with
higher BP targets (11–13, 20, 22, 23). Many of these studies,
however, did not achieve the targeted BP, and there was little
difference in BP between the intensive treatment and control
groups. Therefore, these studies may not have been able to
detect differences in clinical outcomes.
The original wording of the first 2 paragraphs under that
heading was “High-quality evidence showed reductions in all-
cause mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.83 to 0.98];
absolute risk reduction [ARR], 1.64), stroke (RR, 0.74 [CI, 0.65
to 0.84]; ARR, 1.13), and cardiac events (RR, 0.77 [CI, 0.68 to
0.89]; ARR, 1.25) for treating patients with a baseline SBP of
160 mm Hg or greater who achieved a target SBP of less than
150 mm Hg (11–21). In studies with lower SBP targets (<140
mm Hg), low-quality evidence showed no statistically signifi-
cant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.69 to
1.06]; ARR, 0.80) or cardiac events (RR, 0.82 [CI, 0.64 to 1.00];
ARR, 0.94) (11–13, 20, 22, 23). For studies with lower BP tar-
gets, moderate-quality evidence showed a reduced risk for
stroke (RR, 0.79 [CI, 0.59 to 0.99]; ARR, 0.49) compared with
higher BP targets (11–13, 20, 22, 23). Many of these studies,
however, did not achieve the targeted BP, and there was little
difference between the intensive treatment and control
groups. Therefore, these studies may not have been able to
detect differences in clinical outcomes.”
In the Figure, the benefits statements reads as follows:
“Incidence of stroke and cardiac events were reduced with
treatment to <150 mm Hg‘and ‘
Treating to 140 mm Hg did
not have additional benefit”.
The original wording was “Mortality, incidence of stroke, and
cardiac events were all reduced with treatment” and “Treating
to a lower BP target did noti further reduce mortality, quality
of life, or functional status, but it did reduce the incidence of
stroke and cardiac events”.
The first paragraph under Recommendation 1 on page
433 now reads as follows: “High-quality evidence showed that
treating hypertension in older adults to moderate targets
(<150/90 mm Hg) reduces stroke (ARR, 0.92) and cardiac
events (ARR, 0.72). Moderate-quality evidence showed a pos-
sible reduction in mortality, however, the results did not quite
achieve statistical significance (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.85 to 1.00]).
Most benefits apply to all adults regardless of whether they
have diabetes. We rated the overall evidence as high because
effects were favorable across outcomes and the reduction in
mortality was nearly statistically significant. The most consis-
tent and greatest absolute benefit was shown in trials with a
higher mean SBP at baseline (>160 mm Hg). Any additional
benefit from aggressive BP control is small, with a lower mag-
nitude of benefit and inconsistent results across outcomes.”
The original wording of that paragraph was “High-quality ev-
idence showed that treating hypertension in older adults to
moderate targets (<150/90 mm Hg) reduces mortality (ARR,
1.64), stroke (ARR, 1.13), and cardiac events (ARR, 1.25). Most
benefits apply to such adults regardless of whether they have
diabetes. The most consistent and greatest absolute benefit
was shown in trials with a higher mean SBP at baseline (>160
mm Hg). Any additional benefit from aggressive BP control is
small, with a lower magnitude of benefit and inconsistent re-
sults across outcomes.”
The first paragraph under Recommendation 3 on page
433 now reads: “An SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg is a
reasonable goal for some patients with increased cardiovas-
cular risk. While pooled estimates of all studies demonstrated
no statisticaly significant reductions in mortality, cardiac
events, or stroke a single large, high quality study (SPRINT)
did find benefits across all outcomes in high risk individuals
without diabetes. The target depends on many factors unique
to each patient, including comorbidity, medication burden,
risk for adverse events, and cost. Clinicians should individually

 assess cardiovascular risk for patients. Generally, increased
cardiovascular risk includes persons with known vascular dis-
ease, most patients with diabetes, older persons with chronic
kidney disease with estimated glomerular filtration rate less
than 45 mL/min/per 1.73 m2, those with metabolic syndrome
(abdominal obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipide-
mia), and older persons. Among the included studies,
SPRINT (23) defined patients with increased cardiovascular
risk as those meeting at least 1 of the following criteria: clinical
or
subclinical
cardiovascular
disease
other
than
stroke;
chronic kidney disease, excluding polycystic kidney disease,
with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20 to less than
60 mL/min/1.73 m2 of body surface area; 10-year risk for car-
diovascular disease of 15% or greater based on the Framing-
ham risk score; or age 75 years or older. This trial found that
targeting SBP to less than 120 mm Hg compared with less
than 140 mm Hg in adults without diabetes or prior stroke, at
high-risk for cardiovascular disease, and with a baseline SBP
of less than 140 mm Hg significantly reduced fatal and nonfa-
tal cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. In contrast,
ACCORD (40) included only adults with type 2 diabetes at
high cardiovascular risk and found no statistically significant
reduction in the primary composite outcome of nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascu-
lar events (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.80 to 1.11]). This study did find a
reduction in stroke events (RR, 0.58 [CI, 0.39 to 0.88]), but
there were more serious adverse events associated with an
SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg versus less than 140 mm
Hg. In light of the low quality evidence of no statistically sig-
nificant reduction in mortality, cardiac events, or stroke from
pooled estimates from all studies, but benefit shown by
SPRINT, as well as the known harms, burden, and costs of
more intensive pharmacological therapy, an individualized as-
sessment is important to evaluate the benefit of lower blood
pressure targets relative to harms in patients age 60 years and
older.”
The original wording of that paragraph was “An SBP target of
less than 140 mm Hg is a reasonable goal for some patients
with increased cardiovascular risk. The target depends on
many factors unique to each patient, including comorbidity,
medication burden, risk for adverse events, and cost. Clini-
cians should individually assess cardiovascular risk for pa-
tients. Generally, increased cardiovascular risk includes per-
sons
with
known
vascular
disease,
most
patients
with
diabetes, older persons with chronic kidney disease with esti--
mated glomerular filtration rate less than 45 mL/min/per 1.73
m2, those with metabolic syndrome (abdominal obesity, hy-
pertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia), and older persons.
For example, among the included studies, SPRINT (23) de-
fined patients with increased cardiovascular risk as those
meeting at least 1 of the following criteria: clinical or subclin-
ical cardiovascular disease other than stroke; chronic kidney
disease, excluding polycystic kidney disease, with an esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate of 20 to less than 60 mL/min/
1.73 m2 of body surface area; 10-year risk for cardiovascular
disease of 15% or greater based on the Framingham risk
score; or age 75 years or older. This trial found that targeting
SBP to less than 120 mm Hg compared with less than 140 mm
Hg in adults without diabetes or prior stroke, at high-risk for
cardiovascular disease, and with a baseline SBP of less than
140 mm Hg significantly reduced fatal and nonfatal cardiovas-
cular events and all-cause mortality. In contrast, ACCORD (40)
included only adults with type 2 diabetes and found no statis-
tically significant reduction in the primary composite outcome
of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death
from cardiovascular events (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.80 to 1.11]). This
study did find a reduction in stroke events (RR, 0.58 [CI, 0.39
to 0.88]), but there were more serious adverse events associ-
ated with an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg versus less
than 140 mm Hg.”
Under the “High Value Care” heading on page 435, “in
some patients” should be added to the end of first clause of
the sentence, “Although some benefit is achieved by aiming
for lower BP targets, most benefit occurs with acceptable
harms and costs in the pharmacologic treatment of patients
who have an SBP of 150 mm Hg or greater.”
