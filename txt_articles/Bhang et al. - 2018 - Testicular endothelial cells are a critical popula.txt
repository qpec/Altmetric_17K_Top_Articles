Maintenance of adult tissues depends on stem cell self-renewal in local niches. Spermato-
gonial stem cells (SSC) are germline adult stem cells necessary for spermatogenesis and
fertility. We show that testicular endothelial cells (TECs) are part of the SSC niche producing
glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and other factors to support human and
mouse SSCs in long-term culture. We demonstrate that FGF-2 binding to FGFR1 on TECs
activates the calcineurin pathway to produce GDNF. Comparison of the TEC secretome to
lung and liver endothelial cells identified 5 factors sufficient for long-term maintenance of
human and mouse SSC colonies in feeder-free cultures. Male cancer survivors after che-
motherapy are often infertile since SSCs are highly susceptible to cytotoxic injury. Trans-
plantation of TECs alone restores spermatogenesis in mice after chemotherapy-induced
depletion of SSCs. Identifying TECs as a niche population necessary for SSC self-renewal may
facilitate fertility preservation for prepubertal boys diagnosed with cancer.

 A
dult mammalian tissues are maintained by stem cell
populations that self-renew in specialized organ-specific
niches
providing
the
factors
necessary
for
their
maintenance1,2. However, for most organs, the niche cells
necessary for stem cell self-renewal have not yet been identified.
Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are well-characterized adult
stem cells necessary for fertility. However, the cellular populations
in the SSC niche have not yet been described and although
endothelial cells (ECs) in other organs contribute to stem cell
niches, a role for testicular endothelial cells (TECs) in the SSC
niche has not been examined. Studies have shown that bone
marrow ECs are critical in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
vascular niche producing stem cell factor, necessary for HSC
maintenance and self-renewal in the bone marrow3–5. Brain ECs
are another example of ECs in a stem cell niche as brain endo-
thelium contributes to neural stem cell maintenance via secretion
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) among other
factors6,7. It is increasingly evident that endothelium functions in
an organ-specific manner to both regulate developmental pro-
cesses and maintain normal organ homeostasis via production of
tissue-specific secretomes8,9.
SSCs are an adult stem cell population within the testis that
self-renew maintaining productive spermatogenesis in the adult
male. Previous studies have identified glial-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF) as critical for SSC self-renewal with transgenic
loss- and gain-of-function mouse models of GDNF confirming
the necessity of this factor for the maintenance of SSCs10. After
the observation that GDNF was necessary for spermatogenesis,
culture conditions for mouse SSCs were rapidly developed with
the addition of GDNF and other growth factors sufficient to
maintain mouse SSCs cultured on embryonic fibroblast feeder
cells for months11. SSCs harvested from mice and other animals
can now be routinely expanded, and although previously pub-
lished studies have described conditions for culturing human
testicular cells12,13, expansion of human SSCs for clinical use
cannot yet be reproducibly or routinely performed. This road-
block is due in part to our lack of knowledge regarding the
identity of the critical SSC niche cells which produce GDNF and
other factors. GDNF is expressed by Sertoli cells and peritubuluar
myoid (PTM) cells14, but there are no definitive studies showing
that either of these GDNF-producing populations can support the
long-term maintenance and expansion of SSCs. Previous studies
suggested that GDNF may be expressed by vascular cells in the
testes. GDNF expression was detected by immunohistochemistry
in the arterioles and arteries of the testes15 and transcriptional
analysis of testicular endothelium suggest that TECs could be a
source of GDNF16. However, the role of TECs in the SSC niche
has not yet been investigated. The inability to maintain human
SSCs in culture has detrimental consequences on the quality of
life for prepubertal boys diagnosed with cancer. SSCs are parti-
cularly sensitive to cytotoxic therapies and these patients lack
options to obtain mature sperm, and thus many become per-
manently infertile after completion of cancer treatment.
Recent estimates suggest that 1 in 530 young adults between
the ages of 20 and 39 years is a survivor of childhood cancer17.
While post-pubertal males diagnosed with cancer have fertility
preservation options, no options exist for prepubertal boys. In the
1990s, it was demonstrated that spermatogenesis could be
restored in mice sterilized after treatment with the chemother-
apeutic agent busulfan by injecting germ cells from a syngeneic
donor into their seminiferous tubules18,19. These results suggested
that SSCs might be harvested, before the start of chemotherapy
and reintroduced into the testis upon treatment completion.
However, testicular biopsies from prepubertal boys contain only a
minute number of SSCs and, hence, require expansion in vitro
prior to subsequent reinjection.
Here we show that TECs are a key population in the male
germline stem cell niche providing necessary growth factors for
self-renewal and expansion of human and mouse SSCs in culture.
We show that injection of TECs alone is sufficient to restore
spermatogenesis in mice after chemotherapy-induced depletion
of SSCs and that TECs, but not other organ endothelium, express
growth factors that are sufficient for the maintenance of SSCs in
culture and include GDNF, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2),
stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), macrophage inflammatory
protein 2 (MIP-2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein
2 (IGFBP-2). Our work reveals that both human and mouse SSCs
can be cultured long term under feeder-free conditions by the
addition of these five factors to the media. Further, our data
demonstrate that GDNF expression is specifically driven by FGF-
2 binding to FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) activating the calcineurin
(CaN)–nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) pathway in
TECs. We show that dysregulation of CaN–NFAT signaling
in ECs can disrupt spermatogenesis and fertility as evidenced in
Down syndrome (DS) male mice. We and others have previously
shown that EC activation is impaired in DS due to increased
expression of chromosome 21-encoded genes that specifically
attenuates the CaN–NFAT pathway20. A DS mouse model shows
defects in SSC self-renewal and/or maintenance and males with
DS have significantly reduced sperm counts and are infertile21,22.
Collectively, our data support the conclusion that the SSC niche is
created in part by TECs providing the necessary factors for SSC
self-renewal and we identify the CaN–NFAT pathway in TECs as
regulating the expression of GDNF, the most critical factor for the
maintenance of spermatogenesis.
Results
TEC transplantation restores spermatogenesis. Busulfan, a
chemotherapeutic agent used as a conditioning regimen prior to
bone marrow transplant, is known to cause azoospermia and
infertility23,24. Both SSCs and differentiating spermatogonia are
killed in mice treated with a single dose of busulfan with the
duration
of
infertility
dependent
on
the
extent
of
SSC
depletion25–27. At higher busulfan doses, SSCs are ablated pre-
ferentially over differentiating spermatogonia and the long delay
until spermatogenesis is restored is likely due to destruction of
most of the SSC niche limiting factors necessary for self-renewal of
the few remaining SSCs. Previous studies have identified GDNF as
critical for SSC self-renewal and demonstrated that Sertoli cells
and PTM cells are cellular sources of GDNF in the testes and may
comprise the SSC niche10,28–30. In testis sections, immunostaining
for GDNF shows co-localization with TECs and throughout the
seminiferous tubules around Sertoli and PTM cells (Supplemen-
tary Figure 1a). However, since GDNF is a secreted factor, its
localization does not indicate its cellular source. GDNF regulation
in the testes is not understood but its expression is dependent in
part upon FGF-231. FGF-2 has been suggested to support SSC
maintenance by inducing GDNF production by Sertoli cells32. To
identify GDNF sources in the testes, we quantified Gdnf mRNA in
Sertoli and TECs cells and measured GDNF levels in media
conditioned by TECs or Sertoli cells before and after FGF-2
treatment (Fig. 1a). Since there are significantly fewer TECs than
Sertoli cells in the testis33, these data indicate that TECs express
more GDNF per cell as compared to Sertoli cells, consistent with
the notion that TECs are a major GDNF-producing population in
the testis34. Since GDNF is necessary for the long-term culture of
SSCs and Sertoli and PTM cells produce GDNF, we investigated
whether Sertoli cells and PTMs could maintain Thy1+SSCs in
culture. Testicular cells (containing Sertoli and PTM populations)
were depleted of CD31+ TECs and co-cultured with GFP+Thy1.2
+SSCs. In parallel, GFP+Thy1+SSCs were also co-cultured with

 CD31+ TECs. After 3 weeks, SSC colonies were absent from
testicular cell co-cultures with Sertoli and PTM cells present. In
contrast, numerous GFP+ Thy1.2+ SSC colonies were observed in
TEC co-cultures (Fig. 1b).
Studies indicate that Sertoli and Leydig cells are minimally
effected by busulfan26 (Supplementary Figure 1b). To examine
the direct impact of busulfan treatment on TECs in vitro and
in vivo, TECs in culture were treated with busulfan and show
decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis (Supplementary
Figure 1c, d), while testis sections from busulfan-treated mice
were immunostained with the EC marker CD31, revealing a
significant decrease in microvessel density (Fig. 1c). A decreased

 TEC population post busulfan treatment is consistent with the
global decrease in testis GDNF expression following busulfan
exposure (Fig. 1d).
Following exposure to busulfan, restoration of spermatogenesis
takes approximately 30–36 weeks, a reflection of the slow
proliferation and expansion of the residual SSCs25,27. To test
whether introduction of healthy TECs can accelerate SCC
reconstitution post busulfan, we transplanted syngeneic wild-
type primary GFP+ TECs into the testes of mice 5 weeks after
busulfan administration. To ascertain whether there is a specific
requirement for TECs in reconstituting spermatogenesis or
whether any organ EC would suffice, we isolated and transplanted
either TECs or lung endothelial cells (LuECs) into busulfan-
treated testes. The EC identity of the transplanted GFP+ TECs
and LuECs was confirmed by morphology, immunostaining with
EC markers and functionally by tube formation assays (Supple-
mentary Figure 2a, b). By 7 weeks after transplantation
(Supplementary Figure 3a), testes harvested from busulfan-
treated mice transplanted with TECs were comparable in size
to sham injected mice (Fig. 1e). GFP+ channels were obvious in
whole testes after transplantation with GFP+ TECs (Fig. 1e). By
contrast, testes in busulfan-treated mice injected with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) or reconstituted with LuECs remained
appreciably smaller (Fig. 1e). Testis sections from busulfan-
treated mice, with and without transplanted GFP+ TECs, were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined for green
fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, a germline stem cell marker
(PLZF) and a germ cell marker (DDX4) (Fig. 1f). We observed
significant restoration of spermatogenesis in testes transplanted
specifically with TECs, comparable to that in untreated mice as
evidenced by increases in PLZF+ and DDX4+ cells (Fig. 1f). We
also found a significant increase in TEC proliferation, microvessel
density and length (Supplementary Figure 3b) and increased
proliferation of germ cells in seminiferous tubules (Supplemen-
tary
Figure
3c).
Notably,
GFP+
cells
co-expressed
CD31
(Supplementary Figure 3c), confirming the EC identity of the
transplanted cells and demonstrating integration of transplanted
TECs into the endogenous testis vasculature. Functionality of
transplanted GFP+CD31+ TECs was confirmed by isolectin B4
uptake (Supplementary Figure 4). Remarkably, testes from
busulfan-treated mice transplanted with LuECs showed nominal
restoration of spermatogenesis (Fig. 1f).
Since our data suggest that TECs promote the restoration of
spermatogenesis after busulfan treatment, we examined whether
TECs could protect SSCs and spermatogonia from busulfan-
mediated cell death by injecting syngeneic wild-type TECs into
the testes of mice immediately after busulfan treatment at 3, 6 and
9 days post busulfan injection, and it demonstrated significant
protection of spermatogenesis 15 weeks after busulfan treatment.
While vehicle-injected mice had no detectable differentiating
sperm and very few seminiferous tubules, TEC-injected mice had
both differentiating sperm and mature sperm in the lumen of
seminiferous tubules as detected by the acrosome-specific marker,
lectin-peanut agglutinin35 (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b).
TECs maintain mouse SSCs in culture without exogenous
GDNF. Since LuECs were unable to restore spermatogenesis in
busulfan-treated mice, we compared GDNF production by TECs,
LuEC and liver ECs (LiECs). Intriguingly, FGF-2 treatment
induced significant levels of GDNF only in TECs, and not in
LuECs or LiECs (Fig. 2a), consistent with studies showing ECs
exhibit organ-specific gene expression profiles36,37. Currently,
in vitro cultures of isolated SSCs utilize STO cells or mouse
embryonic fibroblasts as feeder cells plus GDNF and several other
growth factors28. Our data suggest that ECs within the testicular
stem cell niche can produce GDNF, a necessary factor to promote
SSC proliferation. To confirm the critical supporting role of TECs
in the SSC niche, we compared the efficacy of SSC-enriched
cultures in vitro maintained either with STO cells or with TECs.
After plating SSC-enriched cultures with either TECs or STO cells
and adding GDNF and FGF-2 to the serum-free culture media,
we monitored the formation of SSC colony number and size. Co-
cultures of GFP+ SSC-enriched cultures with TECs led to a sig-
nificant increase in both number and size of colonies compared
with STO co-cultures (Fig. 2b). After 5 days, SSC-enriched cul-
tures in the absence of feeder cells did not survive (Supplemen-
tary Figure 6a).
To determine whether TECs can support SSC self-renewal and
maintenance in the absence of additional GDNF, we assayed
three-dimensional (3D) colony-forming capacity of Thy-1.2+
SSC-enriched-TEC co-cultures since efficient 3D colony forma-
tion is a hallmark of stem cells. GFP+Thy-1.2+ cells were plated
either with Matrigel alone or together with primary mouse TECs
in the absence of exogenous GDNF (Supplementary Figure 6b).
GFP+Thy-1.2+ cells co-cultured with TECs and Matrigel formed
colonies with typical SSC morphology after 2 weeks as observed
by phase contrast microscopy, while SSC-enriched cultures plated
in the absence of TECs or GDNF died within 7 days (Fig. 2c and
Supplementary Figure 6b, c). The stem cell identity of these
colonies was confirmed by expression of the germ stem cell
marker DDX4 (Fig. 2c). Next, we co-cultured an excess of GFP
+Thy-1.2+ cells to TECs and Matrigel with these cultures
demonstrating significant numbers of large, spheroid colonies as

 maintain SSCs in vitro. Moreover, these putative GFP+ SSC/TEC
colonies were dissociated and serially passaged multiple times in
the presence of TECs without measurable decline in colony-
forming efficiency (Fig. 2e).
Transplanting SSCs co-cultured with TECs restores fertility.
Since murine SSCs can expand and self-renew on STO feeder
cells, we compared the function of murine SSCs expanded on
TECs versus STO cells. First, we examined colony formation by
cultured SSCs in vivo, by transplanting equal number of GFP+
SSCs co-cultured with TECs or STO feeder cells into testes of
busulfan-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 6e). At 12 weeks
after transplantation, recipient mice testes were analyzed for
colony formation of GFP+ SSCs co-cultured with either TECs or
STO cells (Fig. 3a). We found that testis transplanted with SSCs
co-cultured with TECs showed significantly more colonies than
testis transplanted with SSCs co-cultured with STO (Fig. 3a).
The ultimate confirmation of SSC function is the ability of
infertile
mice
to
give
birth
to
live
offspring
after
SSC
transplantation. GFP+ SSCs co-cultured long term with TECs
were transplanted into W/Wv mice which lack germ cells and are
infertile38,39. At 16 weeks after transplantation, GFP+ SSC
colonization of the testes was observed as well as the birth of
GFP+ pups (Fig. 3b) with Gfp expression in pups confirmed by
PCR (Fig. 3c). Testis sections from mice transplanted with SSCs
after long-term culture were immunostained with the undiffer-
entiated spermatogonia markers PLZF and CD49f as well as the
spermatid marker peanut agglutinin (PNA), further demonstrat-
ing functional spermatogenesis of transplanted GFP+ SSCs
(Fig. 3d).
GDNF is regulated by an FGF-2–FGFR1–CaN–NFAT signaling
axis. The mechanism of GDNF regulation in the testes is not well
understood but its expression is known to be, at least in part,
dependent upon FGF-231. FGF-2 has been suggested to promote
SSC maintenance by inducing GDNF production by cells in the
testes. Quantification of GDNF levels in media conditioned by
primary TECs after FGF-2 treatment indicate that TECs produce
GDNF. Our data show FGF-2 treatment induced significant levels
of GDNF only in TECs, and not in LuECs or LiECs, consistent
with studies showing ECs exhibit organ-specific gene expression
profiles36,37.
FGF-2 activation of ECs occurs primarily through binding to
FGFR140. To determine the requirement for FGFR1 expression
on TECs for GDNF production, we isolated TECs from our
mouse model of inducible Fgfr1 deletion in ECs, referred to as
Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC mice. Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC TECs were treated with FGF-
2 and subsequently GDNF levels were measured in the media.
Fgfr1−/− TECs showed no increase in GDNF expression after
FGF-2 treatment as compared to Fgfr1+/+ wild-type TECs
(Fig. 4a). To examine the effect of Fgfr1 deletion in TECs8 on
spermatogenesis in vivo, wild-type male mice were treated with
busulfan, and 5 weeks later transplanted with Fgfr1−/− TECs,
Fgfr1+/+ TECs or PBS alone. Testes harvested from mice
12
weeks
after
transplantation
with Fgfr1−/− TECs
were
comparable in size and weight to testes that were injected with
PBS alone and significantly smaller in size and weight than testes
transplanted with Fgfr1+/+ TECs (Fig. 4b). Testis sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and demonstrate a
significant number of seminiferous tubules lacking developing
sperm (Fig. 4c). We also observed a significant decrease in PLZF+
cells and ECs as well as a reduction in proliferating germ cells in
testes from Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC mice (Supplementary Figure 7a, b).
Our data implicate FGF-2 binding to FGFR1 is a key regulator of
GDNF expression in TECs, and thus we co-cultured Thy1.2+GFP
+ cells with TECs and added FGF-2 alone or with GDNF
(Fig. 4d). While colony formation was robust as quantified by
both number and size of colonies in the co-cultures supplemented
with FGF-2 and GDNF, the addition of FGF-2 alone to the
growth media was sufficient for SSC maintenance and expansion
(Fig. 4d) presumably due to the presence of TEC-derived GDNF.
Collectively, our data suggest that GDNF production should be
impaired in mice with an endothelial-specific deletion of Fgfr1
affecting SSC self-renewal after busulfan-mediated injury. Wild-
type and Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC mice were treated with busulfan and
4 weeks later testis sections were immunostained for GDNF
showing significantly decreased expression in the testes of
Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC mice even after low-dose busulfan treatment
(Fig. 4e). Since expansion of residual SSCs after low-dose
busulfan treatment requires GDNF, 4 weeks after busulfan
treatment, we examined the presence of SSCs in testis sections
from Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC mice by immunostaining for the SSC
markers, Lin28 and Sall4. In contrast to wild-type mice, there
was an almost complete absence of both Lin28+ and Sall4+ cells
in
testis
sections
from
Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC
mice
(Fig.
4f
and
Supplementary Figure 7c). If FGFR1 expression is necessary for
GDNF production, transplanting Fgfr1−/− TECs should not
restore spermatogenesis in busulfan-treated mice. Indeed, H&E
sections of testes harvested from busulfan-treated mice after
transplantation of Fgfr1-null TECs showed minimal spermato-
genesis and few DDX4- or PLZF-positive cells as compared to
mice transplanted with Fgfr1 wild-type TECs (Fig. 4g). Immu-
nostaining with markers of differentiating sperm PNA and CD49f
further confirmed the inability of Fgfr1−/− TECs to re-establish
robust spermatogenesis in busulfan-treated mice (Fig. 4g).
Spermatogenesis defects in DS mice. Our data indicate that
GDNF production by TECs is induced by FGF-2 binding to
FGFR1. The most common signaling pathway downstream of
FGF-2 is the MAP kinase pathway; however, other pathways have
been linked to FGF-2–FGFR1 signaling including the calcium
activated CaN–NFAT axis40. We and others have previously
shown that endothelial activation is impaired in DS due in part to

Other studies show that males with DS have significantly reduced
sperm counts and are either subfertile or infertile21,22. The
Ts65Dn DS mouse model with segmental human trisomy has
many features of DS including male infertility41,42. An almost
complete lack of developing sperm throughout the seminiferous
tubules and in the lumens along with an overall decrease in tubule
size is observed by 8 weeks in these mice (Supplementary Figure

 differentiating sperm, as well as OCT4 and PLZF, primordial
germ cell markers43, and the proliferation marker Ki67. The
Ts65Dn testes exhibited decreased DDX4-, PZLF- and OCT4-
positive cells over time as compared to euploid littermates (Fig. 5a
and Supplementary Figure 8b). Examination of Sox9, a marker of
Sertoli cells, revealed moderate decreases in this population in
Ts65Dn testes versus euploid controls (Supplementary Figure 8c).
To further investigate the role of TECs and associated
spermatogenic defects of DS with a more tractable system, we
used human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from Trisomy
21 (DS) and control human subjects to generate ECs. Trisomy 21
was confirmed by karyotype (Supplementary Figure 9a), while EC
identity was validated by immunostaining with EC markers
VEGFR2, CD31, VE-cadherin and von Willebrand factor and
functionally by capillary tube formation and acetylated low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake (Supplementary Figure 9b). ECs
derived from DS-iPS-ECs failed to organize into tube-like
structures on Matrigel and exhibited defective proliferation and
migration as compared to control (C) iPS-derived ECs in
response to VEGF (Supplementary Figure 9b-d and Supplemen-
tary Movie a,b). Analysis of the secretome of C- and DS-iPS-
derived ECs identified a dramatic decrease in GDNF expression
(Supplementary Figure 9e). Previously, we have shown that
defects in ECs derived from the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS were
due to attenuation of CaN–NFAT signaling20. To examine the
effect of FGF-2 on GDNF production by both C- and DS-iPS-
ECs, we treated both groups with FGF-2 and measured GDNF
production in conditioned media. In C-iPS EC, FGF-2 stimulated
robust GDNF production that was significantly abrogated in the
presence of the specific CaN inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA).
However, in DS-iPS EC, the relatively modest induction of GDNF
by FGF-2 was unaffected by CsA (Fig. 5b). FGF-2 treatment also
stimulated significant GDNF production in a CaN-dependent
fashion in primary ECs specifically from mouse TECs and to a
much lesser extent in mouse LuECs and LiECs (Fig. 5c). To
further validate the importance of TEC-derived GDNF in the SSC
niche, we transplanted wild-type GFP+ TECs into the testes of
Ts65Dn DS mice and showed restoration of spermatogenesis
(Fig. 5d).
In astrocytes, FGF-2 regulates GDNF production by inducing
the expression of early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1), a
transcription factor that binds the Gdnf promoter44. Egr-1 and
Nfat family members synergize to activate gene expression in
numerous tissues45,46. We postulated that FGF-2 binding to
FGFR1 activates CaN with subsequent cooperation between
NFAT and EGR-1 to promote GDNF expression by TECs.
Western blot analysis confirmed increased EGR-1 expression
specifically in TEC and not LuEC after FGF-2 treatment or upon
expression of a constitutively active nuclear Nfatc1 construct
(caNfatc1) (Fig. 5e) that also increases GDNF production by
TECs (Supplementary Figure 10a). Similarly, in DS-iPS EC with
attenuated calcineurin signaling20, there was minimal EGR-1
expression after FGF treatment but expression of a caNFATc1
construct did upregulate EGR-1 (Supplementary Figure 10b).
Previous studies have shown that Nfatc1 induces Egr-1 in a CaN-
dependent manner44,45; thus, to determine whether EGR-1
upregulation was dependent on NFATc1 activation, the sub-
cellular localization of NFATc1 and EGR-1 was assessed in TECs
after FGF-2 treatment with and without CsA (Fig. 5f and
Supplementary Figure 10c). While the nuclear localization of both
NFATc1 and EGR1 increased after the addition of FGF-2, CsA
inhibited FGF-2-induced EGR-1 nuclear localization, indicating
CaN dependence (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Figure 10c).
Additionally,
an
NFATc1
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) shows that caNfatc1 binds to the Egr1 promoter but not
the Gdnf promoter in TECs, while an EGR-1 ChIP indicates
direct EGR-1 binding to the Gdnf promoter in TECs (Fig. 5g and
Supplementary Figure 10d, e). Collectively, our data support a
model whereby FGF-2 binding to FGFR1 on TECs activates a
CaN–NFAT–EGR1–GDNF pathway regulating GDNF produc-
tion by TECs (Fig. 5h).
Human SSCs are maintained in long-term culture. Numerous
studies have cultured murine SSCs for long term and transplanted
them into busulfan-treated infertile male mice11. However, studies
demonstrating long-term culture of human SSCs have been lim-
ited and not easily reproduced47,48. To determine whether human
SSCs expanded on ECs retain their stem-like properties, we
obtained testicular biopsies from prepubertal boys diagnosed with
cancer prior to the onset of treatment. Due to the very small
sample size of these biopsies, we plated the entire sample of tes-
ticular cells onto a monolayer of human ECs to minimize any loss
of SSCs through selection. Because we were unable to isolate TECs
from these minute testicular biopsies, we utilized human iPS-
derived ECs labeled by Dil-Ac-LDL uptake. Using both fresh and
previously frozen testicular biopsies, we examined putative SSC
colony formation in vitro over time cultured with either iPS-ECs
(Fig. 6a) or without ECs. By day 30, both fresh and frozen testi-
cular cells co-cultured with iPS-ECs displayed classic SSC-like
colonies throughout the culture, while freshly isolated testicular
biopsies plated in the absence of ECs but supplemented with
GDNF and FGF-2 died after 2 weeks. Both freshly isolated and
previously frozen SSC-like cells with ECs continued to expand
over time with numerous SSC-like colonies throughout the cul-
tures observed at day 150 (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Figure 11a).
To validate the presence of SSCs in colonies from our testicular
cell/EC co-cultures, we examined expression of human SSC
markers. Sections were immunostained for SSEA4 and CD49f/

 visible in the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 6c). By 40 days post
transplantation, the formation of PKH67+ colonies in the semi-
niferous tubules were evident (Fig. 6c). Testes were isolated, sec-
tioned and immunostained positively for SSEA4, a SSC marker,
indicating the presence of SSCs in PKH67+ colonies (Fig. 6d).
Our data suggest that TECs, but not other organ endothelium,
can support SSC self-renewal. Thus, we compared the secretome
of TECs to that of LuECs and LiECs during tube formation assays
to identify unique factors produced during TEC activation that
may be critical for SSC maintenance. Besides GDNF, we
identified three other factors that were specifically upregulated
in TECs and also upregulated in TECs expressing caNFATc1
implicating their CaN dependence (Fig. 6e). These factors,
IGFBP-2, SDF-1 and MIP-2, have been implicated in stem cell
biology and hence were added along with GDNF and FGF-2 to
human testicular cells or mouse testicular cells (Supplementary
Figure 11b) in vitro in the absence of feeder cells. By day 15, SSC
colonies with typical morphology were observed in our feeder-
free cultures. By day 25, robust SSC colony formation was
observed that were maintained even after 85 days in culture
(Fig. 6f). Quantification of SSC numbers in feeder-free cultures
show that addition of GDNF, FGF-2, IGFB2, SDF-1 and MIP-2
supported significant increases in SSC numbers over 9 weeks in
comparison to cultures with only GDNF and FGF-2 (Fig. 6g). The
ability to culture and expand SSCs under feeder-free conditions
has important clinical significance by allowing the expansion of
SSCs from testicular biopsies obtained from prepubertal boys
prior to cancer treatment for restoration of fertility after a cancer-
free diagnosis. To confirm that human SSCs continue to grow on
human TECs, we plated entire testicular biopsy samples onto
human TECs and show continued expansion of SSCs cultured
with human TECs over multiple passages with no difference in
growth rates between addition of exogenous FGF-2 alone or FGF-
2 with GDNF (Fig. 6h). Collectively, our data support our
hypothesis that human TECs are a critical source of GDNF and
other factors that are necessary and sufficient to support the self-
renewal and expansion of human SSCs in vitro. This provides a
feasible approach to expand the minute number of human SSCs
present in testicular biopsies obtained from prepubertal boys for
later transplantation to restore spermatogenesis and fertility.
Discussion
It has long been established that stem cells, a self-renewing
population of cells in most organs, are maintained in specialized
tissue niches that require heterotypic supporting cells to provide
factors necessary for their maintenance1,2. However, for most
organs, including the testis, the accessory cells required for stem
cell self-renewal have not yet been conclusively identified. Col-
lectively, our data implicate the testicular endothelium as a key
population in the SSC niche producing GDNF and other factors
necessary for SSC self-renewal. Here we show that TECs can
maintain and expand putative SSCs in long-term culture,
restoring spermatogenesis in mice after chemotherapy-induced
infertility. SSCs cultured long term with TECs were functional as
demonstrated by the birth of live pups after transplanted GFP+
SSCs. Further, we identified five growth factors produced speci-
fically by TECs, but not other organ endothelium that are suffi-
cient to maintain SSC-like colonies in feeder-free cultures. Our
studies also provide insight into the mechanisms regulating
GDNF
expression
in
TECs
by
demonstrating
FGFR1–CaN–NFAT signaling as the key pathway.
For many years, it was assumed that endothelium throughout
the body was functionally redundant. However, more recently
studies have shown that ECs in different organ environments
have distinct properties and roles with organ-specific functions
regulated in part by unique secretomes. For example, liver
endothelium has been shown to underlie liver regeneration by its
production of hepatocyte growth factor, while lung endothelium
is required for lung regeneration after injury due to its expression
of MMP148,9. It is becoming increasingly evident that ECs from
different organs are not interchangeable. Our data clearly indicate
specialized roles for TECs in the germ cell niche that cannot be
replaced by ECs from other tissues. Further confirmation of the
significance of TECs in the SSC niche was observed by the
restoration of spermatogenesis observed in DS mice after trans-
plantation of wild-type TECs into the testis of Ts65Dn DS mice.
Our data indicate defects in TEC activation in DS due to
attenuation of the CaN–NFAT pathway by chromosome 21-
encoded inhibitors of this pathway preventing transactivation of
the NFAT-dependent target, GDNF.
GDNF has been identified as the single most important factor
in SSC self-renewal as its loss leads to impaired spermatogenesis
and its overexpression to expansion of undifferentiated sperma-
togonia in transgenic mouse models10. Other cells in the testis
such as Sertoli cells and PTM cells are also thought to produce
GDNF53,54. However, our data show that the restoration of
murine spermatogenesis requires 6-month post-busulfan treat-
ment due to the slow expansion of the few surviving SSCs27, while
transplantation of TECs into the testis after busulfan-induced SSC
loss restores spermatogenesis within weeks. Further, injection of
wild-type TECs into mice immediately after busulfan treatment is
sufficient to protect SSC destruction indicating a pro-survival
function for TECs. While it is likely that the contribution of
GDNF from Sertoli and PTM cells are also necessary for SSC
maintenance, the level of GDNF produced from these two
populations in the testes may not be sufficient. Since FGF-2 is also
necessary for the maintenance of SSCs, we propose that FGF-2
activates TECs to produce GDNF and other factors for SSC self-

less critical with TECs, Sertoli cells and PTMs all required to
produce sufficient GDNF for SSC self-renewal.
Although murine SSCs can be expanded in culture, the ability
to reproducibly culture human SSCs in the long term has not yet
been achieved12,47. The lack of fertility preservation options for
prepubertal boys diagnosed with cancer has been attributed to the

 inability to reproducibly expand the minute SSC population in
testicular biopsies obtained from these patients prior to the onset
of cancer treatment. Here our data indicate that human SSCs can
be maintained in co-culture with human TECs in the long term.
Functional confirmation of long-term cultured human SSCs was
observed by migration to the basement membrane of the semi-
niferous tubules of Nude mice after transplantation. We show
that TECs may be sufficient for the self-renewal and expansion of
SSCs; however, the clinical application of stem cells is often
hindered by a requirement for feeder cells. Since supplementation
of GDNF alone is not sufficient for SSC survival when cultured on
STO cells, we screened the secretome of activated TECs in
comparison to liver and lung ECs. We identified IGFBP-2, SDF-1
and MIP-2 as specifically produced by TECs and previously
implicated in stem cell biology55,56. Our work shows that the
addition of IGFBP-2, SDF-1 and MIP-2 along with GDNF and
FGF-2 is sufficient for the expansion and long-term culture of
both murine and human SSCs in the absence of feeder cells.
Collectively, our data provide evidence for TECs as a key
population in the germ cell niche providing GDNF, IGFBP-2,
SDF-1 and MIP-2 for the maintenance of SSCs. Delineating the
contribution of the CaN–NFAT pathway in regulating GDNF
production in TECs presents therapeutic targets for male infer-
tility. Of great clinical significance is the identification of five
growth factors that permit feeder-free expansion of SSCs in vitro
removing the risk of transmitting feeder cell-derived viruses to
SSCs. These data will allow us to expand human SSCs obtained
from testicular biopsies of prepubertal boys diagnosed with
cancer prior to the onset of cancer treatment with the possibility
of preserving fertility in this patient population by eventually
reintroducing SSCs upon treatment completion and a cancer-free
diagnosis.
Methods
Cell viability assay. 1 × 103 TECs or Sertoli cells (Lonza) were plated in 96-well
plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The 96-well plates assays were coated with
0.1% gelatin prior to seeding. Busulfan (Sigma) was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) used at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 96 h. Media were
removed and 100 μl of MTT working solution (ScienCellTM) was then added to
each well followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. The MTT working solution was
removed and 50 μl of DMSO was added to each well. Samples were read at 550 nm
wavelength. Each condition was performed in triplicate with n = 3 experiments.
Statistics were analyzed with GraphPad Prism.
TEC proliferation and apoptosis assays. 5 × 103 testicular ECs per well were
plated on 8-chamber slide (LabTeK) coated with 0.1% gelatin. Busulfan (800 μM)
or DMSO were added to each well 24 h after seeding and cultured for 72 or 96 h.
Then, 10 μM BrdU (BD PharmingenTM) was added to media 72 h after busulfan
treatment and then incubated for 2 h. Samples were stained with anti-BrdU (1:50;
Invitrogen), anti-γ-H2AX (1:400; Millipore) and anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1: 400; Cell
Signaling). BrdU+ cells in 10 random high-powered fields were counted and sta-
tistics were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Each condition was performed in
triplicate.
Human testicular cells. Human testicular cells from prepubertal boys were
obtained through open testicular biopsies performed by an urologist during a
procedure when the patient is under general anesthesia for another purpose, i.e.,
central line placement, bone marrow aspirates/biopsies. This procedure occurs
before any cancer therapy is initiated. A small incision is made in the superior pole
of the testis and an approximately 80 mm3 portion of the extruded seminiferous
tubules is excised (about 2 mm × 4 mm × 10 mm). The size varies depending on the
size of the patient. Consent was obtained prior to obtaining testicular biopsies.
Given the young age of these patients, their parents signed the informed consent
form and assent was obtained from the patients over the age of 12 years. All
procedures were approved by the institutional review board at the Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia.
Isolation of TECs. To isolated TECs, testes from 3–4-week-old mice were har-
vested and minced as fine as possible. Testes tissues were digested in Hanks'
balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 10 mg ml−1 of type collagenase
(Worthington) and 20 µg ml−1 of DNase I (Sigma) for 35 min at 37 oC with
shaking over 250 rpm. Digested tissues were collected by spinning down 1500 rpm
for 5 min at 4 oC and tissue pellets were resuspended in 0.25% tyrpsin added with 7
mg ml−1 of DNase I (Worthington), then incubated at 37 oC for 5 min. Separated
cells were then strained sequentially through a 100 µm and a 40 µm strainer and
trypsin activity was quenched with equal volume of fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Isolated cells were washed once with 10 ml of HBSS and spindown at 1000 rpm for
10 min at 4 oC. The cells were resuspended in 100–200 µl of MACS buffer and
mixed with 10–20 µl of CD31 microbead (Miltenyi Biotec: Cat: 130-097-418) and
10–20 µl of mouse Fc receptor blocker and then incubation for 15 min at 4 oC.
Antibody binding cells were isolated by MACS cell separation following the
manufacturer’s instruction. Purified cells were confirmed by immunostaining with
CD31 (1:50, BD; Cat: 553370), VEGFR2 (1:100; Cell signaling; Cat: 55B11) and VE-
cadherin (1:100, Santa Cruz; Cat: SC-9989), which were specifically expressed on
ECs and Dil-Ac-LDL uptake assay (Alfa Aescar).
SSC cultures with TECs or TEC-negative testicular cells. C57BL/6J mice were
obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN, USA). All mice were used at
2–3 weeks of age. For the isolation of TECs and TEC-negative testicular cells,
magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) with anti-CD31 and anti-Thy-1
microbeads was conducted (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA, USA). Briefly, fresh
testes were placed in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY, USA) and decapsulated. Seminiferous tubules were then incu-
bated in a 4:1 solution of collagenase type II (Worthington) 10 mg ml−1 and 0.5
mg ml−1 DNAse I (Worthington) in DPBS at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were cen-
trifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and then incubated in a 4:1 solution of 0.25%
trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and 7 mg ml−1 DNAse I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in
DPBS at 37 °C for 5 min. Enzyme digestion was inactivated by the addition of FBS
(Biotechnics research, INC. USA) equivalent to 10% of the initial reaction volume.
After digestion, testis cell suspension was filtered through 100 μm and 40 μm nylon
mesh (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min
at 4 °C. TECs were isolated by MACS with anti-CD31 antibody microbeads. To
separate TEC-negative population excluding germ cells, CD31− cells were then
used for MACS with anti-Thy-1 microbeads and Thy-1- testicular cells were col-
lected, resulting in CD31− Thy-1− testicular cells. The 2D co-cultures were gen-
erated by plating 3.0 × 105 cultured GFP+ SSCs on top of 200 μl of solid Matrigel
mixture containing TEC or TEC-negative testicular cells in serum-free medium.
Western blot analysis. Testes harvested from vehicle or busulfan-treated wild-
type mice were homogenized in RIPA buffer and protein concentration quantified
by the BioRad DC Protein Assay. Per sample, 25 µg of protein was separated by
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), probed
with anti-GDNF rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz, Cat: 13147) or anti-
cleaved Caspase 3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Cat: 9664)

 and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Blots were stripped and re-
probed with β-actin as a loading control. See Supplementary material for
uncropped blots.
Immunohistochemistry. Testes dissected from male mice were cryoprotected
overnight in 20% (wt vol−1) sucrose and then frozen in OCT (Tissue-Tek). Testis
sections (10 or 30 μM) were blocked (5% normal goat serum and 0.1% bovine
serum albumin in 0.1% phosphate-buffered saline with Tween-20 (PBS-T)) for 1 h
and washed in 0.1% PBS-T. Primary antibodies, anti-CD31 rat-pAb (1:50; BD
science, Cat: 550274), anti-PLZF rabbit polyclonal Ab (1:50; Santa Cruz, Cat:
22839), anti-DDX4 rabbit pAb (1:200; Abcam, Cat: 13840), anti-Sox9 rabbit pAb
(1:200; Millipore, Cat: ABE579), anti-GDNF rabbit polyclonal Ab (1:50; Santa
Cruz, Cat: SC328), were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h at room
temperature (RT), then incubated with either anti-mouse Alexa 594 (1:1000,
Thermo Fischer, Cat: A110323) or anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:1000, Thermo Fischer,
Cat: A32723) at RT for 30 min. Sections were stained for 1 min to detect nuclei.
Immunofluorescence images of testis regular sections were captured with Axio-
Vision software (Zeiss) mounted on a Zeiss Imager M2 microscope or 30 μM
thickness sections were captured Z-stack with Zeiss LSM 710 confocal, then all Z-
stack images were reconstructed as a projection images by ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health). Digital images were analyzed for the area and density of
endothelial cell markers, germline stem cell markers and GDNF by counting 5
random 20× fields per testis section.
Mice were killed 5–6 weeks after busulfan treatment and tissues were fixed in
paraformaldehyde overnight and then embedded in paraffin. Slides were cut in 5
μM sections. For antigen retrieval, the sections were baked at 60 °C for 60 min and
subjected to antigen retrieval using DAKO target antigen retrieval solution (Dako,
Carpinteria, CA) at 99 °C for 20 min. Sections were blocked in normal donkey
serum and then incubated with primary antibody overnight. Secondary antibody to
the appropriate species followed by amplification with streptavadin-horseradish
peroxidase was used. Slides were stained with AEC+ substrate. Bright-field images
were captured by Olympus BX51 (Olympus) with an AxioCam digital camera
(Zeiss). A random section of testis was examined under 200× and the field searched
for complete tubules seen in cross-section without evidence of obvious fixation
artifact. After all cross-sectional areas were counted, the field was randomly moved
and all cross-sectional tubules counted in that field. This was continuing until the
10–20 tubules were counted per slide.
GDNF ELISA and mRNA. Testis, lung, or liver ECs were plated (10,000 cells ml-1)
on 12 well dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin and cultured for 24 hours. Conditioned
media was harvested at 24 and 48 hours after FGF-2 (2 ng ml-1, 20 ng ml-1 and 50
ng ml-1) treatment and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
for GDNF (Promega GDNF Emax immunoassay system, #G7621) following the
manufacturer’s instruction. Statistics was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. For
quantification of Gdnf mRNA, total RNA was isolated from the cells using Direct-
zol RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research) and reverse transcribed using High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. All gene expression levels were normalized to Gapdh mRNA
levels.
Testicular cell proliferation. 1 × 104 total testicular cells were plated onto gelatin-
coated 8-well LabTek chamber slides and cultured overnight. TEC-derived GDNF
in the media was neutralized by the addition of 2 µg ml−1 of GDNF antibody or
IgG1 at 4 oC overnight followed by the addition of protein G at 4 oC. After GDNF
depletion was confirmed by GDNF ELISA, conditioned media were added to
testicular cells for 24 h. Testicular cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
followed by blocking in 5% normal goat serum and permeabilization in 0.1%
bovine serum albumin in 0.1% PBS-T. Proliferation was detected by immunos-
taining with anti-Ki67 rabbit polyclonal-FITC Ab (1:50; Abcam) or isotype-
matched control antibodies. Primary antibodies were added for 1 h. Cells were
washed with PBS-T before the addition of anti-mouse-Alexa 594 (1:1000; Mole-
cular Probes) for 30 min and protected from light. Nuclei were stained with 1%
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 1 min. Cells were washed with PBS,
mounted and imaged as described above. Ki67+ and SSC+ cells were counted in 10
random fields and the percent positive cells were analyzed by software prism
(GraphPad Prism).
Transplantation of GFP+ SSCs. Five to six -week-old male C57Bl/6 mice were
treated with one dose of busulfan (45 mg kg−1, Sigma) by intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injection to deplete SSCs. After 6 weeks, busulfan-treated C57Bl/6 mice were used
as recipients. Because of their lack of endogenous spermatogenesis, W/Wv mice
were used as recipients for transplantation experiments to produce offspring. To
quantify donor-derived spermatogenesis, donor cells were transplanted into
busulfan-treated C57Bl/6 mice. To determine whether donor cells were capable of
producing offspring, donor cells were transplanted into 4–6-week-old W mutant
mice. The recipients were anesthetized i.p. with 75 mg kg−1 ketamine and
0.5 mg kg−1 medetomidine and microinjected with either 10 μl of 3D Matrigel
cultured GFP+Thy-1.2+SSC or GFP+testicular or lung endothelial cells (5 × 108
cells per ml) isolated from C57Bl/6 GFP-ubiquitin transgenic mice into the testes of
recipient mice. Approximately 10 μl (2.5 × 106 cells per ml) of donor cells were
transplanted into busulfan-treated C57Bl/6, resulting in approximately 80% filling
of the seminiferous tubules. To conduct progeny generation transplantation,
approximately 2 μl (70 × 106 cells per ml) of donor cells were transplanted into W
mutant mice through efferent ducts and then 1.5 μl (50 × 106 cells per ml) of TECs
were directly injected into inner space of testis. At 3 months after transplantation,
recipient testes were analyzed for donor-derived spermatogenesis under fluorescent
microscope. All animal procedures were performed according to the approved
guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Chung-Ang University in
accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the
National Institutes of Health (IACUC assurance no. 11–0038) and the University
of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC protocol no. 804423).
Mice. C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. VE-cadherin-Cre-
ER mice were provided by Ralf Adams. Fgfr1fl/fl mice were generated as previously
described8. All mice were used at 5–6 weeks of age. All animal experiments were
performed under the guidelines set by the University of Pennsylvania IACUC and
approved by the same committee. WBB6F1-W/Wv mutant mice (W mutant mice),
obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), were used as
recipients for transplantation.
SSC-enriched cultures. The 2D co-cultures were generated by plating 2.7 × 105
cultured GFP+ SSCs on STO feeder cells28 or on top of 200 μl of solid matrigel
mixture containing TEC (BD Bioscience) in serum-free medium28 with exogenous
GDNF 10 ng ml−1 (R&D System), GFRα1 75 ng ml−1 (R&D system) and FGF-2 1
ng ml−1 (BD Biosciences). Average GFP+ SSC colony area was measured and
GFP+ SSC cell number were counted 8 days after plating. Each condition was
performed in triplicate.
The 3D spheroid colonies were generated by isolation of Thy-1.2+ GSCs from
the testes of 6–8-day-old mice. Next, 50,000 freshly isolated Thy-1.2+ germ stem
cells were mixed with 25,000 TECs or LuECs in a 2:1 mixture of Matrigel and
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Gibco) containing 10% FBS, 2 mmol l−1
L-glutamine, 100U L−1 penicillin–streptomycin and 1 ml of ITS universal (BD
Bioscience) and plated into 8-well LabTek chamber slides (Thermo Scientific).
Cultures were incubated at 37 oC for 40 min to solidify followed by the addition of
germ stem cell media to the top of the solid Matrigel mixture. Cultured Thy-1.2+
SSC spheroid colony numbers and the average diameter of colonies were measured
on the indicated days after plating.
Transplantation of TECs into Ts65Dn mice. Nine-week-old Ts65Dn male mice
were anesthetized with Avertin (250 mg kg−1) by i.p. injection for surgical cell
transplantation. At transplantation, 10 μl (0.5 × 108 cells per ml) of TECs from
C57BL/6 wild-type GFP-ubiquitin transgenic mice were microinjected into the
testis of Ts65Dn mice. After transplantation, the surface tubules of the testes were
filled about 50%, and Trypan blue was used to examine cell death.
iPSC differentiation. To generate iPSC lines, either human fibroblasts/stromal
cells were transduced with pMXs-based retroviral supernatant with human OCT4,
SOX2, KLF4, or MYC as previously described30, or mononuclear cells were infected
with pHage2-CMV-RTTA-W and pHage-Tet-hSTEMMCA-loxP virus as pre-
viously described31. All cells were cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes in human
endothelial cell medium (Lonza; EGM®-MV Bulletkit) with 50 ng ml−1 additional
VEGF. Then, 500,000 disaggregated single embryonic bodies from human iPSCs
were cultured for 48 h. Non-adherent cells were gently removed and adherent cells
were cultured for 1–2 passages. Cells at 80–90% confluence were dissociated with
enzyme free cell dissociation solution (Millipore) for 30 min and isolated with a
human CD34 microbead kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer’s
instruction. Isolated CD34+ cells were cultured until cells were confluent. CD34+
cells were selected with human CD31 microbead kit (Miltenyi Biotec) and
CD34+CD31+ cells were characterized by Ac-LDL uptake, immunostaining with
CD31, VEGFR2 and VE- cadherin, and matrigel tube formation assay.
ChIP. ECs were transfected with caNFATc155 and cultured in endothelial cell
growth medium. Cells were washed with PBS, crosslinked for 10 min in 1% for-
maldehyde, quenched with 0.125 M glycine, washed with PBS, then lysed (10 mM
Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, protease inhibitors, H2O) and cytoplasmic
contents removed. Nuclei were then lysed (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1%
SDS, protease inhibitors, H2O) and sonicated. Samples were precleared with pro-
tein G and 50 µg of mouse IgG for 2 h at 4 oC. Samples were centrifuged, pellets
discarded and supernatant incubated overnight with antibody bound beads (10 µg
antibody and protein G slurry). Antibodies used were anti-NFATc1 (Sc-7294; Santa
Cruz) and mouse IgG. Crosslinking was reversed, DNA eluted, and qPCR per-
formed for the region between −1000 and −830 on the Egr1 promoter, using
primers F: 5’-ACCTAGAACAATCAGGGTTCCGCA and R: 5’-AGTGTCCCAAG
AACCAGTAGCCAA. The negative control primers cover the region from −548 to
−420 on the Egr-1 promoter, and the sequences are primers F: 5’-AGACCT-
TATTTGGGCAGCGCCTTA and R: 5’-GCCACTGCTGCTGTTCCAATACTA.

 GFP+ Thy-1.2+ germline stem cell and TEC transplantation. The 5–6-week-old
male C57Bl/6 mice were treated with one dose of busulfan (45 mg kg−1, Sigma) by
i.p. injection to deplete SSC19. After 6 weeks, busulfan-treated mice were anes-
thetized with 2–4% isoflurane and microinjected with either 10 μl of 3D Matrigel
cultured GFP+Thy-1.2+ SSC (5 × 106 cells per ml) or GFP+ testicular or lung
endothelial cells (5 × 108 cells per ml) isolated from C57Bl/6 GFP-ubiquitin
transgenic mice into the testes of recipient mice. All animal procedures were
performed according to the approved guidelines of the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Chung-Ang University in accordance with the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (IACUC
assurance no. 11–0038) and the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA)
IACUC (IACUC protocol no. 804423).
Statistical analysis. Prism (GraphPad) was used for graphing and statistical
analysis of data. Statistical significance was determined by T-test (two-tailed
unpaired) and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test between two groups.
