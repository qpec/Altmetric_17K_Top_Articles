Although morphine remains the primary drug prescribed for alleviation of severe or persistent pain, both preclinical and clinical studies
have shown that females require two to three times more morphine than males to produce comparable levels of analgesia. In addition to

on microglia. Morphine action at TLR4 initiates a neuroinflammatory response that directly opposes the analgesic effects of morphine.
Here, we test the hypothesis that the attenuated response to morphine observed in females is the result of increased microglia activation
in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a central locus mediating the antinociceptive effects of morphine. We report that, whereas no overall
sex differences in the density of microglia were noted within the PAG of male or female rats, microglia exhibited a more “activated”
phenotype in females at baseline, with the degree of activation a significant predictor of morphine half-maximal antinociceptive dose
(ED50) values. Priming microglia with LPS induced greater microglia activation in the PAG of females compared with males and was

activation and contribute to the sexually dimorphic effects of morphine in the rat.

Introduction
Opioid therapy remains a primary strategy for severe and chronic
pain management, with 3–4% of adults in the United States re-
ceiving long-term opioid therapy (Dowell et al., 2016); however,
preclinical studies using a variety of acute and persistent pain
assays have repeatedly demonstrated that morphine is more ef-
fective in males than in females (Dawson-Basoa and Gintzler,
1993; Mogil et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2006; Craft et al., 2008; Loyd
et al., 2008b). Decreased analgesic efficacy is often countered with
dose escalation, leading to increased risk of negative side effects
associated with opiate consumption, including respiratory de-
pression, tolerance, and overdose (Trescot et al., 2006).
Several exogenous opioids, including morphine, bind to the my-
eloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) coreceptor of the innate im-
mune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (Hutchinson et al., 2010).
TLR4 is located primarily on microglia (Lehnardt et al., 2002;
Lehnardt et al., 2003; Jou et al., 2006; Marinelli et al., 2015) and
activation of the MD2–TLR4 complex promotes the expression of
pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory compounds including

 cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF�), interleukins
(IL-1�, IL-6, IL-10), chemokines (CXCL3), and prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) (Bonizzi and Karin, 2004; Doyle and O’Neill, 2006;
Hutchinson et al., 2008c; Hutchinson et al., 2010). Activation of
TLR4 and the release of proinflammatory signaling molecules in-
creases neuronal excitability via upregulation of the �-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor
(Ogoshi et al., 2005; Stellwagen et al., 2005), downregulation of glu-
tamate transporter (Yan et al., 2014; Eidson et al., 2017), and de-
creased �-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor expression that
togetherinducehyperalgesia.Therefore,morphineparadoxicallyre-
duces its analgesic efficacy through TLR4-mediated inflammation
(Song and Zhao, 2001; Hutchinson et al., 2007; Hutchinson et al.,
2010; Franchi et al., 2012; Li, 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Eidson and
Murphy, 2013a, 2013b; Eidson et al., 2017).
The ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is a
critical neural locus mediating the antinociceptive effects of mor-
phine (Morgan et al., 2005; Loyd et al., 2007). Direct PAG admin-
istration of morphine induces long-lasting analgesia, whereas
identical administration of the opioid antagonist (�)-naloxone
or lesions of PAG �-opioid receptor (MOR) completely abolish
the antinociceptive effects of systemic morphine (Loyd et al.,
2008b). The antinociceptive effects of intra-PAG morphine are
highly sex-dependent, such that in males, the half-maximal anti-
nociceptive dose (ED50) of morphine ranges from 1.2 to 1.6 �g/
�l, whereas in females, ED50 values range from 16 to �50 �g/�l
(Krzanowska and Bodnar, 1999; Loyd et al., 2008b; Bobeck et al.,
2009).
MD-2 is densely expressed within the PAG and administra-
tion of morphine activates PAG microglia, opposing the analgesic
effects of morphine and inducing tolerance in a TLR4-dependent
manner (Eidson and Murphy, 2013a, 2013b; Eidson et al., 2017).
Similarly, blockade of PAG microglial activation in male rats via
TLR4 inhibition potentiates morphine analgesia and suppres-
ses the development of tolerance (Eidson and Murphy, 2013a;
Eidson et al., 2017). Here, we test the hypothesis that the sexually
dimorphic effects of morphine are due to sex differences in mi-
croglia activation in the PAG.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Age-matched (60–90 d old) intact male and normally cycling female
Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) were used. Animals
were pair-housed with the same sex on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights
on at 08:00). Access to food and water was available ad libitum through-
out the experiments except during behavioral testing. All studies were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Geor-
gia State University and were performed in compliance with Ethical Is-
sues of the International Association for the Study of Pain and National
Institutes of Health. All efforts were made to reduce the number of ani-
mals used in these experiments and to minimize pain and suffering.
Vaginal cytology
Vaginal lavages were performed daily beginning 7 d before testing to
confirm that all female rats were cycling normally and to record cycle
stage at the time of testing. Proestrus was identified as a predominance of
nucleated epithelial cells and estrus was identified as a predominance of
cornified epithelial cells. Diestrus 1 was differentiated from Diestrus 2 by
the presence of leukocytes. Rats that appeared between phases were noted
as being in the more advanced stage (Loyd et al., 2007).
Experiment 1: influence of acute morphine administration on
PAG microglia expression and morphology
To determine whether morphine activation of microglia was sexually
dimorphic, male and female rats received a single ED50 injection of (�)-
morphine sulfate (5 mg/kg; National Institute on Drug Abuse, Bethesda,
MD) or saline (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously and were killed by transcardial
perfusion 15, 30, or 60 min after injection. An additional group of ani-
mals served as handled controls, resulting in a total of six to eight animals
per sex per group for a total of 54 males and 48 females.
Immunohistochemistry. At the end of the experiment, animals were
given a lethal dose of SomnaSol (0.5–1.0 ml/kg, i.p.) and transcardially
perfused with 200–250 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride containing 2%
sodium nitrite as a vasodilator, followed by 300 ml of 4% paraformalde-
hyde in 0.1 M potassium PBS (KPBS). Brains were postfixed in 4% para-
formaldehyde and KPBS for 48 h and then placed in a 30% sucrose
solution and stored at 4°C. Brains were sectioned coronally at 25 �m
with a Leica 2000R freezing microtome and stored free-floating in
cryoprotectant-antifreeze solution at �20°C. A 1:6 series through the
rostrocaudal axis of each brain was processed for ionized calcium bind-
ing adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) immunoreactivity using standard
immunhistochemical techniques as described previously (Loyd and
Murphy, 2006). Iba-1 was selected because it is specific to microglia and
is constitutively expressed across all stages of activation, allowing for both
qualitative and quantitative assessment in both healthy/uninjured ani-
mals as well as endotoxin- and morphine-treated animals. Briefly, sec-
tions were rinsed extensively in KPBS to remove cryoprotectant and then
incubated in a rabbit anti-Iba-1 (WAKO Chemicals; 1:10 K) primary
antibody solution in KPBS containing 1.0% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room
temperature, followed by 72 h at 4°C. After rinsing with KPBS, the tissue
was incubated for 1 h in biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson
Immunoresearch; 1:600), rinsed with KPBS, and incubated for 1 h in an
avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (1:10; ABC Elite Kit; Vector Labora-
tories). After rinsing in KPBS and sodium acetate (0.175 M, pH 6.5),
microglia immunoreactivity was visualized as a black or purple reaction
product using nickel sulfate intensified 3,3�-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
solution (2 mg/10 ml) containing 0.08% hydrogen peroxide in sodium
acetate buffer. After incubation in DAB, tissue was rinsed in sodium
acetate buffer followed by KPBS. Sections were then mounted out of
KPBS onto gelatin-subbed slides, air-dried, and dehydrated in a series of
graded alcohols. Tissue-mounted slides were then cleared in xylene and
glass coverslipped using Permount mounting medium.
Densitometry and presentation. Levels of Iba-1 immunoreactivity in the
vlPAG were compared across sex and treatment groups using semiquan-
titative densitometry as described previously (Loyd et al., 2008b; Laprai-
rie and Murphy, 2009; Eidson and Murphy, 2013a). Twelve-bit grayscale
images were captured using a QImaging Retiga EXi CCD camera at-
tached to a Nikon microscope and iVision Image analysis software
(BioVision Technologies). The region of interest included sections
through 6 representative levels of the rostrocaudal axis of the vlPAG
(bregma �6.72, �7.04, �7.64, �8.0, �8.30, �8.80), with 6–12 sections
per brain as described previously (Loyd et al., 2007). Because the distri-
bution of glial cells was bilaterally symmetrical in the vlPAG, sections
were sampled unilaterally.
Morphological analysis of microglia subtype. Microglia morphology is
highly representative of functional state (Karperien et al., 2013). Micro-
glia were sampled as described above (2–3 representative sections of the
caudal ventrolateral PAG (bregma �7.64 to �8.3) per animal) and
classified into one of three principle morphological subtypes: “nonrami-
fied” cells, “intermediate” cells, and “ramified” cells. Nonramified cells
were characterized as having a large circular or oval cell body that is either
completely amoeboid in shape or with one or two thick primary pro-
cesses and no secondary processes. Highly ramified “intermediate” cells
were characterized as having many stout, thick processes arranged in
bundles around a large cell body. “Intermediate” cells often have several
thick primary processes extending a relatively short distance from the
soma; each primary process often has many short secondary processes,
giving these cells a “bushy” appearance, and are very darkly stained with
Iba-1. In contrast to nonramified and intermediate cells, highly ramified
cells have small, round cell bodies with many (generally four to 10) long,
thin processes. The primary processes of highly ramified microglia have
few secondary processes, extend a large distance from the soma, and
are often lightly stained with Iba-1. Representative images of each cell
type are provided in Figure 1. Nonramified and intermediate microglia
are considered to be “active” or “reactive,” whereas highly ramified mi-

 croglia with thin processes are considered to be quiescent (Frank et al.,
2006; Bland et al., 2010; Colton and Wilcock, 2010; Kettenmann et al.,
2011; Karperien et al., 2013; Lenz et al., 2013). Iba1-positive cells were
counted only if the cell body and processes were completely visible within
the image. Ambiguous cells with processes extending beyond the borders
of the image, overlapping cells, and cells out of the plane of focus of the
image were not counted.
Data analysis. Morphological cell counts were conducted using the
ImageJ Cell Counter tool by three independent investigators blinded to
treatment and sex of the animal. Total numbers of microglia were also
determined to assess changes in microglia migration or proliferation.
Morphological cell counts and total microglia number are presented as
the mean � SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS soft-
ware (version 21); data were analyzed using an ANOVA to determine the
significant main effects of sex and treatment on microglia cell counts and
morphology. Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used to determine a priori
specified specific group differences when a significant main effect was
observed. p � 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Experiment 2: correlation between microglia activation and
morphine ED50
To determine whether there was a relationship between microglia mor-
phological subtype and morphine ED50 values, animals (n � 15 males, 8
females) were tested using our cumulative dosing paradigm (Morgan et
al., 2006; Loyd et al., 2008b; Eidson and Murphy, 2013a; Eidson et al.,
2017). Briefly, animals received an injection of morphine every 20 min,
resulting in cumulative doses of 1.8, 3.2, 5.6, 8.0, 10.0, and 18 mg/kg.
Control animals received repeated saline injections (1 ml/kg; s.c; n � 6
males, 7 females). Thermal nociception was assessed using the paw ther-
mal stimulator 15 min after each injection (Hargreaves et al., 1988; Wang
et al., 2006; Loyd et al., 2008a; Eidson and Murphy, 2013a). Briefly, for
this test, the rat is placed in a clear Plexiglas box resting on an elevated
glass plate maintained at 30°C. A radiant beam of light is positioned
under the hindpaw and the time for the rat to remove the paw from the
thermal stimulus is electronically recorded as the paw withdrawal latency
(PWL) in seconds. A maximal PWL of 20 s was used to prevent tissue
damage due to repeated application of the noxious thermal stimulus.
Animals were acclimated to the testing apparatus 30–60 min/d for 3
consecutive days before the start of the experiment and on the day of
testing. All behavioral testing took place between 12:00 and 17:00 (lights
on at 08:00). Temperature of the thermal stimulus was recorded before
and after each trial to maintain consistent recordings between groups
and did not exceed 64°C throughout the course of the experiments. All
testing was conducted blinded with respect to group assignment. To
calculate ED50, PWL data were normalized using GraphPad Prism soft-
ware such that each individual animal’s baseline PWL score � 0% and
20 s � 100%. The normalized data were then plotted and ED50 was
calculated as the point on the x-axis that corresponds to 50% maximal
PWL (Morgan et al., 2006; Eidson and Murphy, 2013a; Eidson et al.,
2017).
Immunohistochemistry. Within 60 min of the final morphine dose,
animals were perfused and tissue was collected for immunohistochemi-
cal analyses. Microglia were categorized in the vlPAG as described above.
To determine whether morphine’s impact on glia morphology was lim-
ited to the PAG or if it represented a more centralized effect, microglia
were also characterized by morphological type for the following brain
regions: rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM; bregma �11.2:�12.2; im-
plicated in pain modulation), superior colliculus (SC; bregma �6.9:
�8.2; high MOR density but not implicated in pain), and substantia
nigra (SN; bregma �5.0:�5.3; high levels of MOR and implicated in
reward and addiction). The medial amygdala (MeA: bregma �2.4:�3.0)
was also analyzed because this region has a high density of microglia, but
is not implicated in pain and is devoid of MOR.
Data analysis and presentation. Morphine ED50 values were compared
between males and females using Mann–Whitney U test to confirm rep-
lication of previously observed sex differences (Loyd et al., 2008a, 2008b).
Analysis of covariation between ED50 values and microglial morpholog-
ical subtype were assessed for each sex using SPSS statistical software;
p � 0.05 was considered significant.
Experiment 3: influence of peripheral endotoxin LPS on microglia
response in the vlPAG
To determine whether sex differences in microglia activation are driven
by morphine or reflected a global sex difference in activation, animals
received an injection of the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin
LPS; 1 mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma-Aldrich; n � 7 males, 6 females) or equivolume
saline (n � 7 males, 6 females). Comparable doses of peripheral LPS have
been shown in male rats to increase the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1�
mRNA in the brain (Buttini and Boddeke, 1995; Nguyen et al., 1998;
Quan et al., 1998; Quan et al., 1999) and alter microglia morphology
(Buttini et al., 1996). LPS-induced febrile responses were monitored
using Thermocron iButtons (Maxim Integrated; model DS1921G),
implanted into the abdominal cavity 7–10 d before testing. Body temper-
ature was recorded in 30 min intervals beginning 6 h before LPS. Animals
were killed and transcardially perfused 6 h after LPS administration,
when central cytokine mRNA levels peak (Nakamura et al., 1999; Turrin
et al., 2001; Qin et al., 2007; Czerniawski and Guzowski, 2014). Tissue
was collected and processed for visualization of microglia (Iba-1) as de-
scribed above. Iba-1 levels were analyzed for the PAG, RVM, SC, SN, and
MeA. A subset of animals were killed by decapitation and their brains
flash frozen for determination of cytokine levels using qPCR as described
previously (Eidson et al., 2017).
Examination and presentation of immunomodulatory cytokines using
qPCR. Flash-frozen brains were sectioned at 300 �m on a cryostat (Leica)
and mounted onto slides. One-millimeter bilateral micropunches were
taken from 6 levels of the vlPAG (bregma �6.72, �7.04, �7.64, �8.0,
�8.30, �8.80) and RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Life Technologies;
15596026) using standard procedures, followed by the addition of Gly-
coblue (Life Technologies; AM5916) for visualization. Concentrations of
RNA (ng/�l) were calculated using a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectropho-
tometer (Version 3.8, Thermo Fisher). After RNA extraction, RNA was
diluted to a standard concentration and converted to cDNA using an
AMV First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using
FastStart Essential DNA Green MasterMix (Roche) and analyzed using a
Roche LightCycler 96 and accompanying software (version 1.1.0.1320,
2011 Roche). Data are presented as the normalized ratio of the target
gene, with corrected amplification efficiency, relative to the GAPDH
control gene. Primer sequences can be found in Table 1.
Data analysis. The impact of sex and treatment on microglia morphol-
ogy and cytokine mRNA levels were analyzed using an ANOVA, with
Bonferroni post hoc analysis where appropriate. Differences between
males and females were compared using independent t tests when k � 2.
Body temperature data were analyzed for significant main effects of sex
and treatment across time using a mixed-model ANOVA with Green-
house–Geisser correction. Body temperature data are presented as the
difference between saline-treated groups at 1 h intervals after LPS. Den-
sity, morphology, and PCR data are presented as �Cq means � SEM;
p � 0.05 was considered significant.
Experiment 4: effect of TLR4 manipulation on morphine analgesia
Intra-vlPAG cannulae implantation. To determine whether PAG TLR4
activation or inhibition impacted morphine analgesia, animals were
anesthetized to a deep surgical plane with 5% isoflurane (maintained at
2–5% isoflurane throughout surgery; Henry Schein Animal Health) and
bilateral guide cannulae (22 gauge; Plastics One) aimed at the vlPAG
(anterior—posterior: 1.7 mm; mediolateral: �0.6 mm; dorsoventral:

 �5.0 mm from lambda) were implanted stereotaxically as described pre-
viously (Loyd et al., 2008b; Eidson and Murphy, 2013a). Animals were
allowed to recover a minimum of 10 d after cannula implantation before
behavioral testing. Injection cannulae were inserted into guide cannulae
once a day for 3 d before testing to acclimate the animals to the injection
procedure and to maintain cannulae patency. Animals with blocked can-
nula were retained as no-injection controls. No significant differences
were observed between noninjected animals (n � 2 males, 5 females) and
those animals receiving intra-PAG saline, so these groups were collapsed
(data not shown).
Experiment 4.1: effects of TLR4 agonism on morphine analgesia. On the
day of testing, male and female rats received a single intra-PAG injection
of LPS (5.0 �g/0.5 �l/side; Sigma-Aldrich) or saline (0.5 �l/side) into the
PAG. This dose has been shown previously to increase glial activation and
cytokine expression (Castan
˜o et al., 2002; Herna
´ndez-Romero et al.,
2008; Eidson and Murphy, 2013a). One hour later, morphine ED50 val-
ues were determined using the cumulative dosing paradigm described in
Experiment 2. A total of 4 treatment groups were generated: Saline �
Saline (n � 5 males, 5 females), LPS � Saline (n � 5 males, 5 females),
Saline � Morphine (n � 8 males, 11 females), and LPS � Morphine (n �
7 males, 8 females).
Experiment 4.2: effects of TLR4 antagonism on morphine analgesia. On
the day of testing, animals received a single intra-PAG injection of (�)-
naloxone (5.0 �g/0.5 �l/side; NIDA) or saline (0.5 �l/side) and, 1 h later,
morphine ED50 values were determined as described above. This dose
was chosen based on our previous experiments demonstrating inhibition
of PAG microglia (Eidson and Murphy, 2013a). A total of 4 treatment
groups were generated: Saline � Saline (n � 5 males, 5 females), Nalox-
one � Saline (n � 5 males, 5 females), Saline � Morphine (n � 8 males,
11 females), and Naloxone � Morphine (n � 7 males, 9 females).
Data analysis and presentation. At the end of the experiment, brains
were removed, flash frozen, and sectioned at 25 �m with a Leica
CM3050S cryostat. Sections from the injection site were mounted on to
slides, Nissl stained, coverslipped, and cannulae placement verified using
a Nikon microscope (10� magnification). Animals with bilateral cannu-
lae located outside of the vlPAG (e.g., in the aqueduct or deep mesen-
cephalic nucleus) were considered “cannulae misses” and were analyzed
for determination of site specificity.
Half-maximal antinociceptive effect (ED50) and 95% confidence in-
tervals were calculated from dose–response curves generated using
GraphPad Prism software as described above. Repeated-measures
ANOVA was used to assess for significant treatment effects, with Bonfer-
roni’s post hoc tests where appropriate. Cannula misses were compared
with “hits” using a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Values of
p � 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Experiment 1: sex, but not morphine treatment, affects
microglia activation in the vlPAG
Male and female rats were administered morphine or saline and
microglia were examined immunohistochemically within the
caudal vlPAG at 15, 30, and 60 min after injection. A separate
group of rats served as handled controls. No significant effect of
time postinjection was noted in microglia morphology for either
the saline- or morphine-treated groups, so these data are col-
lapsed across time. In addition, no significant differences were
observed in total microglia cell counts in the PAG regardless of
sex (F(1,68) � 0.013, p � 0.91) or treatment (F(1,68) � 0.13, p �
0.720) (Fig. 2a).
Overall, females had significantly more nonramified and in-
termediate type microglia in the vlPAG that was independent of
treatment (F(1,76) � 13.10, p � 0.01; Fig. 2b). We next determined
whether the observed sex difference in percentage of activated
microglia was specific for a morphological subtype (nonramified,
intermediate or ramified; Fig. 1). The percentage of both non-
ramified (t � 3.10, p � 0.001) and intermediate (t � 2.17, p �
0.03) microglia was significantly higher in females than in males
(Fig. 2c). Females also had significantly fewer ramified microglia
than males (t � 3.90, p � 0.001). Together, these data indicate
that, although there are no sex differences in the overall number
of vlPAG microglia, the ratio of nonramified and intermediate to
ramified microglia are significantly greater in females than males
regardless of treatment.
Experiment 2: microglial activation in the PAG correlates
with morphine ED50
PAG or spinal cord activation of microglia has been shown to
oppose morphine analgesia (Watkins et al., 2005; Hutchinson
et al., 2010; Eidson and Murphy, 2013a, 2013b); therefore, we
next examined the degree of association between morphine
ED50 values and PAG microglia morphology for males and
females. Animals were administered cumulative doses of
morphine and killed within 60 min of the final injection
of morphine; microglia morphology was determined im-
munohistochemically. Consistent with our previous studies
(Loyd et al., 2008a; Loyd et al., 2008b), ED50 values were sig-
nificantly higher in females than males (female, 8.69 vs male,
6.01 mg/kg; U � 30.5, p � 0.028) and no relationship was
observed between ED50 and female estrous cycle (r � 0.19, p �
0.19). Morphine ED50 values were significantly correlated
with the percentage of nonramified and intermediate micro-
glia, morphologies typical of “activated” microglia, in the vl-
PAG in both males (r � 0.58, p �0.02) and females (r � 0.68,
p �0.047; Fig. 3a). Further analysis by microglia morpholog-
ical subtype showed no significant correlation for nonramified

females (r � 0.32, p � 0.24). Intermediate microglia corre-
lated significantly with ED50 in females (r � 0.679, p � 0.047),
but not males (r � 0.316, p � 0.15), and ramified microglia
negatively correlated with ED50 in both males (r � �0.58, p �
0.02) and females (r � �0.68, p � 0.047; Fig. 3b). Together,
these data show sex-specific positive correlations between
morphine ED50 and percentage of activated microglia and
reciprocal negative correlations with morphine ED50 and
ramified microglia such that, as the percentage of ramified
microglia decreases, morphine ED50 increases (i.e., morphine
is less efficacious).
We next determined whether the relationship between mi-
croglia morphology and morphine ED50 values was specific to

 the PAG or if it extended to regions also implicated in pain
(RVM) and/or regions with high levels of MOR (SN, SC) or a
high density of microglia (MeA). For females, no significant
correlation between morphine ED50 and the percentage of
nonramified and intermediate microglia was observed in
RVM (r � 0.21, p � 0.32), MeA (r � 0.48, p � 0.12), SC (r �
�0.05, p � 0.46), or SN (r � 0.09, p � 0.44). Similarly, in
males, no significant correlations were observed in the RVM
(r � �0.13, p � 0.35), MeA (r � 0.23, p � 0.24), or SN (r �
0.32, p � 0.20). However, significant correlations between
morphine ED50 and percentage of nonramified and interme-
diate microglia were noted in SC of male rats (r � 0.53, p �
0.05; Fig. 3c–g).
Similar to what was observed for the PAG, no significant
differences were observed in the total number of microglia in
any of the brain regions examined (F(3,28) � 0.152, p � 0.93;
data not shown), indicating that the difference in the number
of activated cells between males and females is not due to
increased proliferation or migration of activated microglia.
Rather, these data indicate that morphine ED50 positively cor-
relates with the overall percentage of nonramified and inter-
mediate microglia, states typical of activation, in the PAG in

 males and females, with sex-specific differences in correlations
noted for the SC.
Experiment 3a: immune challenge activates vlPAG microglia
to a greater extent in females than in males
The results from the above experiment show that, although there
were significantly more microglia with a nonramified or interme-
diate morphology in females than males, these microglia were
unaffected by morphine treatment. Therefore, we next tested
whether administration of LPS, a TLR4 agonist, activated vlPAG
microglia in a sex-dependent manner. Peripheral administration
of LPS induced a significant increase in the percentage of non-
ramified and intermediate microglia in the vlPAG of females
(19%), but not males (12%; Fig. 4a); significant main effect of sex
(F(1,22) � 18.26, p � 0.001) and treatment (F(1,22) � 11.84, p �
0.001). Similar to what was noted in Experiment 1, females had
more nonramified and intermediate microglia in the PAG at
baseline (p � 0.03).
Analysis of microglia by morphological subtype showed a sig-
nificant main effect of both sex (F(2,44) � 13.14, p � 0.001) and
treatment (F(2,44) � 6.44, p � 0.001) on microglia morphology
and no interaction (F(2,44) � 0.55, p � 0.58). Specifically, saline-
treated females had significantly more intermediate (t � 2.43,
p � 0.05) and significantly fewer ramified (t � 2.83, p � 0.03)
microglia than saline males. Similarly, LPS-treated females had
significantly more intermediate (t � 2.95, p � 0.01) and signifi-
cantly fewer ramified (t � 3.10, p � 0.01) microglia than LPS
males (Fig. 4b), suggesting a more “activated” morphological
state in females. The observed sex difference in microglia mor-
phology in the PAG was not accompanied by differences in
sickness behaviors because no sex differences in core body tem-
perature were observed in animals treated with LPS (F(1,13) �
2.22, p � 0.16; Fig. 4d). These data suggest that, in females, PAG
microglia may be more responsive to TLR4 activation (i.e., lower
threshold) than their male counterpart.
No significant main effects of sex on total number of non-
ramified and intermediate microglia were observed in any other
brain region examined (Fig. 4e). In contrast to what was noted
with morphine, the main effects of LPS treatment were observed
in several brain regions, including the SC (F(1,20) � 10.862, p �
0.001) in males (p � 0.01), but not females (p � 0.08), and the
RVM (F(1,15) � 5.76, p � 0.03) in males (p � 0.03), but not
females (p � 0.32). No significant main effects of LPS treatment
were observed in the MeA or SN and no interaction effects were
observed in any brain region tested. Finally, no significant differ-
ences were observed in the total number of microglia in any brain
regions examined (data not shown).
Experiment 3b: immune challenge induces greater cytokine
expression in the vlPAG of females
To determine whether the observed sex differences in PAG mi-
croglia morphology was accompanied by sex-specific differences
in proinflammatory cytokine transcription, qPCR was used to
quantify PAG mRNA levels of proinflammatory TNF, IL-1�,
IL-6, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 (Fig. 5). LPS induced a signif-
icant increase in vlPAG TNF transcription in both males (p �
0.001) and females (p � 0.001) compared with saline controls
(F(1,42) � 50.72, p � 0.001). LPS treatment also induced in a
significant increase in IL-1� transcription in females (p � 0.001)
and males (p � 0.001); a significant main effect of treatment
(F(1,38) � 47.08, p � 0.00). Notably, IL-1� levels were signifi-
cantly higher in LPS-treated females than males (p � 0.03). LPS
did not change IL-6 significantly in either sex (F(1,34) � 0.19, p �
0.67). PAG transcription of the anti-inflammatory cytokine
IL-10 was significantly higher in males than in females (F(1,44) �
14.99, p � 0.001). LPS induced a significant decrease in IL-10
mRNA in females (t � 3.33, p � 0.001), but not males (t � �0.19,
p � 0.86; Fig. 5e). Together, these data demonstrate that PAG
TLR4 activation induces an exaggerated proinflammatory re-
sponse and a reduced anti-inflammatory response in females
compared with males. Furthermore, these data support our im-
munohistochemical studies demonstrating that changes in mi-
croglial morphology are accompanied by measurable changes in
proinflammatory cytokine mRNA.
We also examined LPS-induced changes in PAG TLR4 tran-
scription. LPS administration increased TLR4 transcription by
67% in females and 39% in males; however, these differences
were not statistically significant (treatment, F(1,40) � 2.37, p �
0.13; sex, F(1,40) � 2.37, p � 0.13).
Experiment 4: manipulation of PAG TLR4 signaling has
sex-dependent effects on morphine ED50 values
Our previous studies established a direct link between microglia
activation and morphine efficacy, such that site-specific admin-
istration of the TLR4 agonist LPS resulted in a significant reduc-
tion in morphine efficacy (as indicated by a rightward shift in the
morphine dose–response curve; Eidson and Murphy, 2013a).
Given the results of the present experiments demonstrating that
females show more nonramified and intermediate morphologies
than males, we next examined whether this sex difference in mi-
croglia morphology would result in a sexually dimorphic shift in
morphine ED50. In particular, we tested whether activation of
vlPAG TLR4 via site-specific administration of the endotoxin
LPS would result in a larger rightward shift in the morphine
dose–response curve in females compared with males. We fur-
ther examined whether blockade of TLR4 signaling with (�)-
naloxone would result in a greater leftward shift of the morphine
dose–response curve in females, which is indicative of potentia-
tion of morphine antinociception in females.
Intra-PAG administration of LPS resulted in a significant de-
crease in morphine antinociception in both males and females, as
indicated by a significant rightward shift in the morphine ED50
dose–response curve (F(5,30) � 18.01, p � 0.0001; Fig. 6a). LPS
increased male ED50 values from 3.04 to 10.69 mg/kg, a 3.5-fold
difference, p � 0.001; female ED50 values increased from 7.9 to
20.61 mg/kg, a 2.6-fold difference, p � 0.05. ED50 values were
approximately 2-fold higher in LPS � Morphine females than
males (20.61 in females vs 10.69 mg/kg in males; p � 0.05). Re-
markably, after LPS priming, 6/8 females continued to respond at
baseline levels following morphine administration at 10 mg/kg; 2
of those 6 females responded near baseline after the 18 mg/kg
dose. Indeed, females in the LPS � Morphine-treated groups were
not significantly different from saline control females that received
nomorphine(Saline�Salinefemales;p�0.05),indicatingthatLPS
pretreatment completely abolished the antinociceptive effects of
morphineinasubsetoffemales.Nodifferencesinresponselatencies
were observed between LPS � Morphine males and Saline � Mor-
phinefemales(p�0.05),indicatingthatLPSactivationofmicroglia
reduced males to “female-typical” levels of analgesia.
No sex differences were observed between Saline � Saline-
treated males and females (p � 0.05), and no significant differ-
ences were observed between LPS � Saline and Saline � Saline
males (p � 0.05) or females (p � 0.05), indicating that LPS
administration alone had no effect on basal PWL, consistent with
what we have observed previously (Eidson and Murphy, 2013a).
Together, these results indicate that microglia activation with
3208 • J. Neurosci., March 22, 2017 • 37(12):3202–3214
Doyle et al. • Sex Differences in Microglia Activity
 LPS significantly decreases or completely abolishes (in 33% of
females) the antinociceptive effects of morphine.
We next determined whether blocking microglia activation
with the TLR4-specific antagonist (�)-naloxone potentiated
morphine analgesia in a sex-dependent manner. In animals
treated with morphine, intra-PAG administration of (�)-
naloxone significantly increased antinociception in females, but
not males, as indicated by a leftward shift in the morphine dose–
response curve (F(3,18) � 13.67, p � 0.0001; Fig. 6b). Specifically,
ED50 values for females treated with (�)-naloxone decreased

 from 7.9 to 3.16 mg/kg (p � 0.001), a 2.5-fold reduction in ED50.
Importantly, ED50 values for (�)-Naloxone � Morphine-treated
females were not significantly different from Saline � Morphine-
treated males (p � 0.05), indicating that blocking microglia activa-
tion within the vlPAG completely abolishes sex differences in
morphine analgesia. A moderate, but significant, increase in mor-
phine ED50 was observed in males receiving (�)-Naloxone � Mor-
phine compared with Saline � Morphine males (ED50 increased
from 3.04 mg/kg vs 5.25 mg/kg; p � 0.05).
No sex differences between Saline � Saline-treated males and
females (p � 0.05) were observed. In addition, we observed no
significant differences between (�)-Naloxone � Saline and Sa-
line � Saline controls in males (p � 0.05) or females (p � 0.05),
indicating that (�)-naloxone administration had no effect on
basal nociceptive thresholds. The effects of (�)-naloxone on
morphine analgesia are site specific; male and female animals
receiving (�)-naloxone outside of the PAG showed signifi-
cantly lower morphine antinociception relative to animals
that received (�)-naloxone within the PAG (F(3,18) � 15.17,
p � 0.001; data not shown). Together, these data indicate
inhibition of vlPAG microglia activity with the TLR4-specific
antagonist (�)-naloxone is sufficient to reverse sex differ-
ences in morphine analgesia.
Discussion
Here, we test the hypothesis that sex differences in vlPAG micro-
glia contribute to the sexually dimorphic effects of morphine. We
report that, although no sex differences in overall number or
density of microglia were noted for the vlPAG at baseline, the
percentage of “nonramified” and “intermediate” versus “rami-
fied” microglia were significantly higher in females than males,
suggesting that females have a more “activated” microglial state
within the vlPAG. Consistent with our previous studies, mor-
phine ED50 values were significantly higher in females (Loyd et
al., 2008a; Loyd et al., 2008b) and a significant relationship was
observed between morphine potency and percentage of reactive
“intermediate” microglia in females, but not males. Although
acute morphine treatment did not change microglia morphology
in either sex, administration of the glial TLR4 agonist LPS in-
creased the percentage of nonramified and intermediate micro-
glia in the vlPAG of females to a greater degree than males, an
effect that was independent of febrile response. LPS-induced in-
creases in microglia activation in females were accompanied by
significantly increased proinflammatory IL-1� transcription and
decreased anti-inflammatory IL-10 transcription. We further
show that priming microglia with LPS significantly attenuates
morphine analgesia in both sexes and completely abolishes the
antinociceptive response to morphine in a subset of females. Sim-
ilarly, inhibition of vlPAG microglia with the TLR4 antagonist
(�)-naloxone significantly potentiates morphine analgesia in fe-
males, but not males, abolishing the sex difference in opiate re-
sponse. Together, these data indicate that vlPAG microglia are
innately different in males and females in terms of their morpho-
logical state (both basal and after immune activation with LPS)
and implicate TLR4 in the attenuated response to morphine ob-
served in females.
Sex differences in morphine analgesia and TLR4

assaystypicallyreportthatmorphineproducesasignificantlygreater
degree of analgesia in males versus females (Craft, 2003; Craft et al.,

with the present results, these studies also report morphine ED50

 values that are 2-fold higher in females than in males. The present
studies demonstrate that sex differences in PAG microglia, and in
particular TLR4 signaling, contribute to the dimorphic response to
morphine. TLR4 signaling has been shown previously to modulate
morphine action in males (Tanga et al., 2005; Hutchinson et al.,
2007; Hutchinson et al., 2008a; Hutchinson et al., 2008b) such that
TLR4 activation with LPS reduces morphine efficacy (Johnston and
Westbrook, 2005). The present studies confirm these previous find-
ingsinmalesandfurtherdemonstratethatinitiationofTLR4signal-
ing significantly, and almost completely, attenuates morphine
analgesia in females. In addition, blockade of vlPAG TLR4 increases
the analgesic efficacy of morphine in females (2.5-fold reduction in
morphine ED50), reversing the observed sex difference in morphine
response.
Several factors have been shown to contribute to the sexually
dimorphic response to morphine. Interestingly, these factors are
also heavily impacted by microglia. For
example, blockade of NMDA signaling in-
hibits microglia activation (Thomas and
Kuhn, 2005; Murugan et al., 2011) and
enhances the antinociceptive effects of
morphine to a greater degree in males
than females (Picker et al., 2011). Sex dif-
ferences in MOR expression and signaling
in the PAG (Bernal et al., 2007; Loyd et al.,
2008b), as well as spinal MOR:KOR
dimerization (Chakrabarti et al., 2010),
have also been shown to contribute to
the dimorphic effects of morphine. MOR
expression is rapidly upregulated after pe-
ripheral inflammation and cytokine re-
lease in male rats (Ji et al., 1995; Mousa,
2003; Puehler et al., 2004), likely a homeo-
static response that counteracts the excit-
atory effects of glial activation and thereby
increases opioid efficacy. Interestingly, no
change in MOR expression is noted in fe-
male rats after peripheral inflammation
(Zhang et al., 2014), which may also con-
tribute to the reduced antinociceptive ef-
fects of morphine observed in persistent
pain assays (Cook and Nickerson, 2005;
Loyd and Murphy, 2006; Wang et al.,
2006; Murphy et al., 2009). We speculate
that NMDAR and MOR activity represent
downstream or parallel targets of mi-
croglia activation and may explain the
existence of multiple mechanisms under-
lying the sexually dimorphic response to
morphine.
Sex-specific differences in TLR4 modu-
lationofpainhavebeenreportedpreviously
(Sorge et al., 2011; Sorge et al., 2015). For
example,inmice,inhibitionortransientde-
pletionofspinalmicrogliareversesmechan-
ical allodynia induced by spared nerve
injury in males, but not females, suggesting
that spinally mediated chronic pain in fe-
males is maintained in a non-TLR-depen-
dent manner (e.g., an adaptive immune-
dependent response; Sorge et al., 2015). In
the present study, chronic pain was not in-
duced;rather,LPSwasadministeredtoacti-
vate microglia in a TLR4-dependent manner. Sex-specific effects of
TLR4activityexemplifytheneedtoconsiderbothsexeswhenstudy-
ing immune responses and the development of drugs affecting im-
mune signaling. Because TLR4 has also been shown to mediate the
rewarding effects of morphine (Hutchinson et al., 2012) and the
developmentoftolerancetomorphine(EidsonandMurphy,2013b;
Eidson et al., 2017), sex differences in TLR4 signaling may have
broad implications for the treatment of chronic pain in men and
women.
Sex differences in innate immune function
In the present study, we show that female rats have significantly
more “activated” microglia in the PAG than males at baseline, a
difference that is potentiated after systemic LPS treatment. This
finding suggests that females have a lower threshold for activation
and/or launch a more robust proinflammatory response com-

 pared with males. Indeed, females of many species launch a more
robust immune response than males (Gaillard and Spinedi, 1998;
Klein, 2000; Schwarz and Bilbo, 2012). For example, in the
peripheral immune system, female mice have higher titers of
immunoglobulins (Klein, 2000) and splenocyte blastogenic re-
sponses to T- and B-cell mitogens than males (Schneider et al.,
2006). Centrally, females often present with greater levels of pro-
inflammatory markers after immune challenge (Tonelli et al.,
2008; Bollinger et al., 2016). Interestingly, despite increases in
PAG microglia activation and IL-1� release in response to LPS
immune challenge in females, we observed no sex differences in
LPS-induced febrile response. However, IL-6, which correlates
most closely with changes in body temperature (LeMay et al.,
1990; Roth et al., 1993; Roth and De Souza, 2001), was not dif-
ferent in males and females and may account for the lack of
observed sex difference in fever response.
The present experiments used normally cycling female rats.
Estrous cycle was monitored, but not controlled or manipulated,
to demonstrate physiologically relevant changes in microglia ac-
tivation as a function of estrous cycle. No significant effect of
estrous cycle was observed in any of the present experiments.
Immunomodulatory effects of sex hormones, specifically estra-
diol, have been shown to alter cytokine release and microglial
activation in a concentration-, age-, and duration-dependent
manner. For example, uterine TNF, IL-1�, and IL-6 levels in-
crease during proestrous and estrous in rats (De et al., 1992),
when estradiol is high. This coincides with our previous data
demonstrating that morphine is least effective in reducing noci-
ception during proestrous (Loyd et al., 2008b). Historically, es-
tradiol is thought to be neuroprotective, but these effects may be
biphasic (Whitacre et al., 1999) such that high levels of estradiol
decrease inflammatory markers and attenuate the inflammatory
response to LPS (Dimayuga et al., 2005), whereas low doses com-
parable to normal circulating levels increase concentrations of
proinflammatory cytokines (Correale et al., 1998). Furthermore,
chronic but not acute estradiol administration increases proin-
flammatory responses in peripheral immune cells of females
compared with males (Calippe et al., 2008; Calippe et al., 2010)
and potentiates LPS-evoked TLR4 immune responses in vitro
(Loram et al., 2012). Consistent with clinical research demon-
strating that women have a much higher incidence rate of auto-
immune disorders and chronic inflammatory conditions such as
migraine (Buse et al., 2013), osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid ar-
thritis (Whitacre, 2001) compared with men, these results sug-
gest that women may have increased susceptibility to immune
challenge and are at a greater risk for developing inflammatory
pathologies than men.
Summary
These studies are the first to implicate vlPAG microglial TLR4 in
sex differences in morphine analgesia and suggest that increased
activation of vlPAG microglia contribute to the attenuated re-
sponse to morphine observed in females. Importantly, these ex-
periments establish that inhibition of vlPAG TLR4 in females
reverses the observed sex differences in morphine analgesia. To-
gether, these data suggest novel methods to improve current
morphine-based pain management via inhibition of TLR4 and
illustrate the necessity for sex-specific research and individual-
ized treatment of pain in men and women.
