IMPORTANCE Procedural sedation for children undergoing painful procedures is standard
practice in emergency departments worldwide. Previous studies of emergency department
sedation are limited by their single-center design and are underpowered to identify risk
factors for serious adverse events (SAEs), thereby limiting their influence on sedation practice
and patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To examine the incidence and risk factors associated with sedation-related SAEs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective, multicenter, observational cohort
study was conducted in 6 pediatric emergency departments in Canada between July 10,
2010, and February 28, 2015. Children 18 years or younger who received sedation for a
painful emergency department procedure were enrolled in the study. Of the 9657 patients
eligible for inclusion, 6760 (70.0%) were enrolled and 6295 (65.1%) were included in the
final analysis.
EXPOSURES The primary risk factor was receipt of sedation medication. The secondary risk
factors were demographic characteristics, preprocedural medications and fasting status,
current or underlying health risks, and procedure type.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Four outcomes were examined: SAEs, significant
interventions performed in response to an adverse event, oxygen desaturation, and vomiting.
RESULTS Of the 6295 children included in this study, 4190 (66.6%) were male and the
mean (SD) age was 8.0 (4.6) years. Adverse events occurred in 736 patients (11.7%; 95% CI,
6.4%-16.9%). Oxygen desaturation (353 patients [5.6%]) and vomiting (328 [5.2%]) were
the most common of these adverse events. There were 69 SAEs (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.5%-1.7%),
and 86 patients (1.4%; 95% CI, 0.7%-2.1%) had a significant intervention. Use of ketamine
hydrochloride alone resulted in the lowest incidence of SAEs (17 [0.4%]) and significant
interventions (37 [0.9%]). The incidence of adverse sedation outcomes varied significantly
with the type of sedation medication. Compared with ketamine alone, propofol alone (3.7%;
odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95% CI, 2.3-13.1) and the combinations of ketamine and fentanyl citrate
(3.2%; OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.5-15.2) and ketamine and propofol (2.1%; OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.3-8.7)
had the highest incidence of SAEs. The combinations of ketamine and fentanyl (4.1%; OR,
4.0; 95% CI, 1.8-8.1) and ketamine and propofol (2.5%; OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-3.8) had the
highest incidence of significant interventions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The incidence of adverse sedation outcomes varied
significantly with type of sedation medication. Use of ketamine only was associated with the
best outcomes, resulting in significantly fewer SAEs and interventions than ketamine
combined with propofol or fentanyl.

 P
rocedural pain and anxiety relief is an ethical impera-
tiveinthetreatmentofchildrengiventhatchildrenhave
short- and long-term physical, physiological, and psy-
chological effects due to untreated pain.1-3 As such, proce-
dural sedation, defined as the administration of medications
to minimize pain and awareness, has become standard prac-
tice in pediatric emergency departments (EDs) worldwide to
facilitate procedures, such as orthopedic reduction and com-
plex laceration repairs.4-8 Although ED sedation is regarded as
safe, it has been associated with serious adverse events
(SAEs).6,9 The incidence of SAEs has been difficult to deter-
mine because of their infrequent occurrence and the lack of
large, multicenter surveillance studies focused on systematic
detectionofadverseevents.PreviousEDsedationstudies,lim-
ited by single-center design and small sample sizes, have not
been able to reliably associate their use with sedation-related
adverseevents,theirseverity,ortheiroutcomesforpatients.9-12
To improve understanding of the safety and comparative
effectiveness of ED procedural sedation, we conducted a large
multicenter cohort study using standardized outcome mea-
sures that are valid and relevant to clinical practice. Our pri-
mary objective was to examine the incidence of sedation-
related adverse events and identify risk factors associated with
these events. Our secondary objectives were (1) to examine the
association of ketamine hydrochloride dose with adverse
events and (2) to describe the variation in duration of seda-
tion and ED length of stay (LOS) across categories of sedation
medications.
Methods
We conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study in 6 ter-
tiary care pediatric EDs in Canada from July 10, 2010, to Feb-
ruary 28, 2015, in a staged roll-out. All sites are members of
the Sedation Safety Study Group of Pediatric Emergency Re-
searchCanada,anationalcollaborativeresearchnetwork.13This
study received approval from the research ethics board at each
participatinginstitution—specifically,IWKHealthCenter,Hali-
fax, Nova Scotia; Montreal Children’
s Hospital, Montreal, Que-
bec; Children’
s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario;
The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario; Stollery Chil-
dren’
sHospital,Edmonton,Alberta;andAlbertaChildren’
sHos-
pital, Calgary, Alberta. Verbal or written patient informed con-
sent, according to site-specific regulations, was obtained from
parents or guardians, and assent was obtained from children
7 years or older.
Study Setting and Population
Children 18 years or younger who underwent parenteral pro-
cedural sedation performed by ED physicians for painful pro-
cedures were eligible for enrollment. Children were excluded
if they received a drug purely for anxiolysis or analgesia with-
outtheintentofsedation,iftherewasalanguagebarrier,orboth.
Study Protocol
All procedural sedations were documented using a site-
specific electronic sedation form created for study purposes
as described in our published protocol.14 The electronic form
(created with Microsoft InfoPath 2007 software; Microsoft
Corp) contained all documentation for study and clinical pur-
poses and was completed by the health care professional car-
ing for the child. If a patient declined participation or was not
approached for enrollment, electronic sedation documenta-
tion continued but program logic prevented study informa-
tionfrombeingsavedtothedatabase.Documentationofstudy
data was standardized to increase efficiency and data quality.
A complete list of data fields collected is included in the pub-
lished protocol.14 All professionals documenting sedation
encounters received standardized training before study
initiation.14 The specifics related to each sedation, including
choice of sedation medication and dose, were left to the treat-
ing physician.
Estimation of Missed, Eligible Patients
To estimate the proportion of sedations not captured at each
site, surveillance for missed, eligible patients was performed
for 7 days during the third week of each month. We extrapo-
lated monthly numbers to estimate overall compliance or con-
sentratesbecausedailysurveillancewasnotfeasibleatallsites
for the study duration. A medical record review of missed pa-
tients was performed to determine their age, sex, sedation
medication, and adverse event occurrence. Methods to iden-
tify missed patients varied by site. Daily hand searching of ED
medical records, pharmacy record queries, and electronic
medication dispensing system queries were performed de-
pending on which method was available and proved to be the
most reliable at each institution. Clinical staff caring for pa-
tients were not aware of the surveillance schedule.
Definitions
Standardized definitions from the Quebec Guidelines, a con-
sensus-based document developed by North American ex-
perts in pediatric procedural sedation, were used for time
intervals and adverse events.15 These intervention-based
definitions represent standardized definitions for outcomes in
procedural sedation and outline uniform data collection for
clinically important events while minimizing the recording of

Key Points
Question What practices lead to the best outcomes in children
undergoing emergency department procedural sedation?
Findings In this multicenter cohort study of 6295 children
undergoing procedural sedation for painful procedures in
emergency departments, administration of ketamine
hydrochloride as a single agent for sedation had the best
outcomes. The addition of propofol or fentanyl citrate to ketamine
increased the rates of serious adverse events and significant
interventions.
Meaning In the hands of emergency department physicians,
procedural sedation for children is safe; sedation achieved using
ketamine only was associated with the fewest serious adverse
events and interventions.

 require both the specific clinical event to have occurred and
1 or more appropriate interventions to be performed with the
intention of treating or managing it. Specific definitions from
the Quebec Guidelines for adverse events measured in this
study are documented in eTable 1 in the Supplement. A suc-
cessful sedation was defined as sedation in which a procedure
(1) was completed and the patient did not have unpleasant re-
call of the procedure, did not resist or require active restraint
during the procedure, or did not experience a permanent com-
plication from the sedation or (2) was not abandoned be-
cause of a sedation-level adverse event.
Outcome Measures
Four outcomes were examined for our primary objective:
SAEs, significant interventions, oxygen desaturation, and
vomiting. An SAE was defined as the occurrence of apnea,
laryngospasm, hypotension, bradycardia, complete airway
obstruction, clinically apparent pulmonary aspiration, per-
manent neurologic injury, or death. Significant interventions
were defined as interventions performed in response to an
adverse event and included positive pressure ventilation,
endotracheal intubation, administration of vasoactive medi-
cations, and administration of neuromuscular blockade or
chest compressions. Oxygen desaturation was defined as the
occurrence of desaturation and the performance of 1 or more
appropriate interventions to improve saturation (eg, tactile
stimulation, airway repositioning, oxygen administration or
increased oxygen, and positive pressure ventilation). Vomit-
ing was defined as the expulsion of gastric contents through
the mouth or nose during sedation induction or mainte-
nance or during ED recovery. For our secondary objectives,
sedation medication dose was defined as the total dose
administered per kilogram of body weight. Duration of seda-
tion was defined as the time from first sedation medication
administration to physiologic recovery, and ED LOS was
defined as the time from first sedation medication adminis-
tration to ED discharge.
Risk Factors
Riskfactorsforadversesedationoutcomeswerechosenapriori
on the basis of clinical knowledge and literature review.14 The
primary risk factor of interest was sedation medication. Other
risk factors were age, sex, body mass index (calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared),
American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classi-
fication (ASA classification),17 underlying health risk (health
issues that may affect the efficacy of sedation or incidence of
adverse events), current respiratory illness, preprocedural opi-
oids (any opioid administered with the intent of treating pain
prior to the administration of the first sedation medication),
fasting status for solids (4 and 6 hours) and liquids (2 hours),
procedure type, number of personnel present during the se-
dation, and duration of procedure. For the outcomes of vom-
iting and oxygen desaturation, preprocedural antiemetic ad-
ministration and preoxygenation, respectively, were also
examined. Risk factors were determined by patient or paren-
tal report, review of the medical record, and physical exami-
nation findings.
Statistical Analysis
The incidence of sedation-related adverse events across all 6
sites was described using frequency and percentage with 95%
CI adjusted for clustering by site. Variances were estimated
using the Taylor series linearization method. Bivariable asso-
ciations between each risk factor and outcome were exam-
ined using the Pearson χ2 or Fisher exact test, as appropriate.
Logistic regression analysis was used to examine multivari-
able associations between risk factors and outcomes. To re-
duce the risk of bias due to small numbers of events, the lo-
gistic regression models were estimated using penalized
likelihood with the Firth adjustment.18,19 To preserve de-
grees of freedom, age was entered as a simple linear term af-
ter examining the assumption of linearity using empirical logit
plots. The estimated odds ratios (ORs) together with 95% pro-
file-likelihood CIs were reported; ORs for age were expressed
in units of 5 years. Two-sided P < .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. The goodness of fit of each model was evalu-
ated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and the discrimina-
tive ability of each model was assessed with the C statistic. To
examine the sensitivity of results to variation between sites,
logistic regression analyses were repeated and a random in-
tercept for study site was added. To prevent a complete or
quasi-completeseparationofpointsintherandomeffectsmod-
els for oxygen desaturation and vomiting, categories for some
risk factors were pooled before analysis.
Subgroup analyses of patients who received ketamine
alone (the largest patient subgroup) were conducted to exam-
ine the effect of total dose on outcomes by using multivari-
able logistic regression, as described for the primary analy-
ses. Ketamine dose was entered as a simple linear term after
examining the assumption of linearity using empirical logit
plots.
Sedation medication dose, duration of sedation, and ED
LOS across categories of sedation medications were de-
scribed using median and interquartile range (IQR). Statisti-
cal analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS In-
stitute Inc) and R, version 3.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing).

 Supplement. Missed patients (2897 [29.9%]) were similar to
included patients in age (mean [SD], 7.6 [4.4] years vs 8.0 [4.6]
years),malesex(57.2%vs66.6%),andadverseeventrate(11.2%
vs 11.7%), but they differed in choice of sedation medication.
Among missed patients, the prevalence of ketamine use was
7.5%, while use of the combination of propofol and fentanyl
citrate was 38.1%. In contrast, included patients used ket-
amine in 3916 (62.2%) sedations and used the combination of
propofol and fentanyl in 726 (11.5%) sedations. These differ-
ences resulted from lower enrolment rates in some sites with
unique practice patterns.
Incidence of Sedation-Related Adverse Events
Overall, there were 831 adverse events in 736 patients (11.7%;
95% CI, 6.4%-16.9%). Oxygen desaturation (353 [5.6%]; 95%
CI, 2.0%-9.2%) and vomiting (328 [5.2%]; 95% CI, 2.4%-
8.0%) were the most common events (Table 2). There were no
cases of complete airway obstruction, pulmonary aspiration,
neurologic injury, or death. There were 69 SAEs (1.1%; 95% CI,
0.5%-1.7%) SAEs, comprising apnea (55 [0.9%]), laryngo-
spasm (4 [0.1%]), hypotension (7 [0.1%]), and bradycardia
(3 [0.1%]). Significant interventions in response to an adverse
event occurred in 86 patients (1.4%; 95% CI, 0.7%-2.1%). Posi-
tive pressure ventilation was the only significant interven-
tion performed. Overall, 95% of sedations were successful; 58
procedures(0.9%)couldnotbecompletedundersedation,and
256patients(4%)showedactiveresistancetocompletingapro-
cedure. There were no unplanned admissions to hospital ow-
ing to a sedation-related adverse event.
Risk Factors of Adverse Events

 Results from the multivariable logistic regression analyses
ofSAEs,significantinterventions,oxygendesaturation,andvom-
itingaresummarizedinFigure2andeTable4intheSupplement.
Serious Adverse Events
Sedation medication was the only risk factor significantly as-
sociated with SAEs. Compared with ketamine alone, all cat-
egories of medications were associated with significantly in-
creased odds of an adverse event. The greatest associations
were for propofol alone (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.3-13.1) and for the
combinations of ketamine and fentanyl (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.5-
15.2) and ketamine and propofol (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.2-8.7).
Significant Interventions
Compared with ketamine alone, sedation with a combination
of ketamine and fentanyl (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.8-8.1) and of ket-
amine and propofol (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-3.8) were associated
with increased odds of significant intervention. Other signifi-
cant risk factors were preprocedural opioid administration
(OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5), laceration repair (OR, 2.4; 95% CI,
1.1-4.7), and age (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5).
Oxygen Desaturation
Comparedwithketaminealone,sedationachievedwithacom-
binationofketamineandfentanyl(OR,2.5;95%CI,1.5-3.8)and
of ketamine and propofol (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.0) were sig-
nificantly associated with oxygen desaturation. Preproce-
dural opioids (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.6), age (OR, 1.3; 95% CI,
1.1- 1.5), and laceration repair (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1- 2.3) or lum-
bar puncture (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.4- 5.1) were also significantly
associated with desaturation.
Vomiting
The only sedation medication significantly associated with
more emesis than ketamine alone was the combination of ket-
amine and fentanyl (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-2.8). Preprocedural
opioidsandlacerationrepairweresignificantlyassociatedwith
an increased odds of vomiting by 50% (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-
1.9) and 70% (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4), respectively, whereas
preprocedural antiemetics were significantly associated with
decreased odds (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7).
The sensitivity analyses accounting for between-center
variation using random effects models are presented in eTable
5intheSupplement.Resultsforsedationmedicationweresimi-
lar to those from the penalized logistic regression analyses.

nificantly associated with SAEs or significant interventions.
However,wefoundasignificantassociationofhigherdosewith
oxygendesaturation(OR,1.3;95%CI,1.1-1.6)andvomiting(OR,
1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5) (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Sedation Time Intervals
Descriptive summaries of sedation duration within categories
ofsedationmedicationsarepresentedineTable7intheSupple-
ment. Sedation with propofol alone was associated with the
shortest sedation duration (median [IQR], 51 [45-126] minutes)
and ED LOS (median [IQR], 67 [43-196] minutes), whereas the
combinationofketamineandfentanylhadthelongestsedation
duration (177 [84-145]) and ED LOS (132 [100-164] minutes).
Discussion
The overall incidence of adverse events in our population was
736 patients (11.7%; 95% CI, 6.4%-16.9%). Oxygen desatura-
tion(353[5.6%])andvomiting(328[5.2%])werethemostcom-
mon events. The low rate of SAEs (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.5%-1.7%)
reported supports the safety of procedural sedation in the
hands of emergency department physicians.
The incidence of SAEs and significant interventions was
lowest among patients sedated with ketamine alone and was
highest among patients sedated with combination drugs ket-
amine and propofol as well as ketamine and fentanyl. After ad-
justing for other risk factors, these combination medications
were associated, respectively, with a 4-fold and 6.5-fold in-
crease in the odds of SAEs, a 2-fold and 4-fold increase in sig-
nificant intervention, and a 2-fold increase in oxygen desatu-
ration. Although propofol alone and the combination of
propofol and fentanyl were associated with a 3-fold and 5-fold
increase in the odds of an SAE, significant interventions in re-
sponsetotheseeventswerenotincreased.Thisfindingislikely
because propofol-associated events are transient and are com-
monly resolved with only minor intervention.
Ourfindingsaboutthecombinationofketamineandpropo-
fol are important because “ketofol” use in ED sedation has in-
creased dramatically over the past decade.20,21 Some clinicians
believe the sedation experience is improved because combina-
tion use offsets each individual agent’
s limitations. Small case
series and randomized trials have not shown a difference in ad-
verse event rates between ketofol and ketamine or propofol

 iting. These findings are in opposition to the common belief
that “ketamine does not exhibit any dose-related adverse
events across the range of clinically administered doses,” as
reportedinthemostrecentketaminepracticeguideline.26(p454)
We found that preprocedural antiemetics were associ-
ated with a 50% reduction in the odds of vomiting. However,
published evidence has shown that their use in children
youngerthan5yearsmaynotbeasadvantageousbecausetheir
baseline risk is much lower.27,28
Preprocedural opioid administration was strongly associ-
ated with increased odds of all outcomes except SAEs, regard-
less of the sedation medication used. Although we do not rec-
ommend limiting opioid use to treat preprocedural pain, we
believe that awareness of this risk factor will help clinicians
prepare for sedation and anticipate potential adverse events.
Undergoingalacerationrepairwastheonlyprocedureasso-
ciatedwithincreasedoddsofalloutcomesexceptSAEs.Thecause
and significance of this association remains to be determined.
Many ED procedural sedation studies examine adverse
events, but most have not been able to comment on SAEs be-
cause of their infrequent occurrence. To our knowledge, only
1 ED study has a sample size that is larger than ours: Green et
al6,27aggregatedandreanalyzeddatafrom32EDstudiesofket-
amine sedation, creating a cohort of 8282 patients. Green and
colleagues’2011 study is limited by clinical and methodo-
logic heterogeneity,29 but we found a similar rate of SAEs and
low rates of adverse events overall.
The Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium is a large col-
laborative that gathers data on pediatric sedation outside the
operatingroom.8,30,31However,thatcohortcontainsfewEDpa-
tients,manypatientshaveseriouscomorbidities(17%ofwhom
are categorized under American Society of Anesthesiologists
class III or higher), and most patients undergo long, elective se-
dations (60% of which are diagnostic imaging).18 These differ-
ences prevent the generalizability of the consortium’
s results
to the ED setting, where generally healthy children are sedated
for short, emergent, and mostly painful procedures.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. It represents the largest, most
robustprospectiveEDproceduralsedationcohorttodate,using
standardized outcome definitions and a novel documenta-
tion process that helped ensure data integrity. The inclusion
ofchildrenfrom6EDswhoweresedatedwith6differentmedi-
cations or combinations of medications for a range of painful
procedures represents the breadth of ED sedation and sub-
stantially enhances the generalizability of our results. We have
been able to both support and refute expert opinion where
there was previously limited clinical evidence to guide prac-
tice. To our knowledge, this study is the first prospective ED
study to comprehensively examine risk factors for sedation-
related SAEs.
Our study also has several limitations. First, because it was
an observational study, direct causal conclusions should not
be drawn from our results. Furthermore, our results could be
confounded by indication. We attempted to adjust for all
knownriskfactorsinourmultivariablemodels,buttherecould
be other unmeasured factors for which we were unable to ac-
count.Second,wedidnotconductdailysurveillanceformissed
patients. There were no cases of sedation-related pulmonary
aspiration, neurologic injury, or death during the study pe-
riod at any of our study sites; however, it is possible that other
SAEs were missed during nonsurveillance weeks. Third, all of
the study sites were tertiary care academic children’
s hospi-
tals, which may limit the generalizability of our results to prac-
tice in general hospitals. Fourth, practice variation in re-
sponse to events is a potential limitation of the Quebec
Guidelines,15 from which our adverse event definitions were
derived.Finally,despiteourlargesamplesize,someevents(eg,
pulmonary aspiration) did not occur, allowing us to conclude
that the risk of these events was no more than 3.1 in 10 000
sedations.32
Conclusions
The large, multicenter cohort in this study shows that ED pro-
cedural sedation for children in this setting is safe, with a low
overall incidence of SAEs and interventions. Sedation with
ketamine alone was associated with the best outcomes, with
significantlyfewerSAEsandinterventionsthanketaminecom-
bined with either propofol or fentanyl.
