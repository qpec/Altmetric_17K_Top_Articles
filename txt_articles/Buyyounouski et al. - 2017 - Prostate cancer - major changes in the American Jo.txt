ABSTRACT: The eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) Staging Manual has been updated and improved to
ensure the highest degree of clinical relevance and to improve its utility for patient
evaluation and clinical research. Major changes include: 1) pathologically organ-
confined disease is now considered pT2 and is no longer subclassified by extent of
involvement or laterality, 2) tumor grading now includes both the Gleason score (as
in the seventh edition criteria) and the grade group (introduced in the eighth edition
criteria), 3) prognostic stage group III includes select, organ-confined disease based
on prostate-specific antigen and Gleason/grade group status, and 4) 2 statistical
prediction models are included in the staging manual. The AJCC will continue to criti-
cally analyze emerging prostate cancer biomarkers and tools for their ability to prog-
nosticate and guide treatment decision making with the highest level of accuracy
and confidence for patients and physicians. CA Cancer J Clin 2017;67:245–253.

Introduction
The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has been working closely with
all of its member organizations throughout the development of the recently pub-
lished eighth edition Cancer Staging Manual. The coordination of the implemen-
tation for a new staging system is critically important to ensure that all partners in
patient care and cancer data collection are working in synchrony.
To ensure that the cancer care community has the necessary infrastructure in
place for documenting eighth edition stage, the AJCC Executive Committee, in
dialogue with the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results program; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the College of
American Pathologists; the National Comprehensive Cancer Network; the
National Cancer Data Base; and the Commission on Cancer, made the decision to
delay implementation of the eighth edition cancer staging system to January 1,
2018.

Prostate Cancer–Major 8th Edition Changes
 Clinicians will continue to use the latest information for
patient care, including scientific content of the eighth edi-
tion manual. All newly diagnosed cases through December
31, 2017 should be staged with the seventh edition. The
time extension will allow all partners to develop and update
protocols and guidelines and for software vendors to devel-
op, test, and deploy their products in time for the data col-
lection and implementation of the eighth edition in 2018.
Prostate Cancer
The AJCC published the first edition of the Cancer Staging
Manual in 1977. Staging is important to: 1) categorize the
severity of disease, 2) estimate prognosis, 3) recommend
treatment, and 4) aid health care providers and researchers
in exchanging information about patients. The AJCC
methodology uses the T (tumor extent), N (lymph node
invasion), and M (presence or absence of metastasis) classi-
fications to group patients. The TNM staging, used in
combination with tumor grade and prostate-specific anti-
gen (PSA), is regarded as a well accepted practice standard
for prostate cancer and is used as the basis for guiding treat-
ment decision making.
According to the American Cancer Society, approxi-
mately 161,360 new cases of prostate cancer will be diag-
nosed, and 26,730 men will die of this disease during
2017.1 The vast majority of prostate cancer, approximately
95%, presents clinically localized to the prostate without
definite evidence of metastasis (ie, cN0M0). As a conse-
quence, the initial clinical assessment of the primary tumor
has been based on digital rectal examination (DRE) find-
ings and histologic confirmation of prostate cancer. Pros-
tate cancer screening with serum levels of PSA, a protein
produced by cells of the prostate gland, yields the majority
of patients who are diagnosed annually, as the majority
present with nonpalpable disease. As a result, many patients
with newly diagnosed prostate cancer present with non-
palpable disease and are classified in the cT1c-category. To
further enhance the value of clinical staging, the AJCC
introduced the addition of pretreatment serum PSA and
tumor grade to TNM classification in the seventh edition
of the manual to create prognostic stage groups. This major
change improved the prognostic value of the AJCC system,
enhanced its clinical relevance, and continues in the eighth
edition.
Summary of Major Changes Between the
Seventh and Eighth Editions
Table 1 lists the major changes between the seventh and
eighth editions of the manual. The first major change to
the staging involves the pathologic subclassification of
organ-confined disease. In the seventh edition, a 3-tier sys-
tem was used to subdivide pathologic T2 disease (pT2)
based on the extent and laterality of disease: pT2a, unilater-
al and confined to less than one-half of a lobe of the pros-
tate; pT2b, unilateral involving more than one-half of a
lobe of the prostate; and pT2c, bilateral involvement. How-
ever, several recent studies have failed to demonstrate the
prognostic value of this distinction.2 Without clear evi-
dence of clinical relevance for a 3-tier system, the current
eighth edition defines a single pT2 category, eliminating
the subcategories, for all organ-confined disease.
The second major change involves incorporation of a
new histopathologic classification of tumors. A new histo-
logic grading system is used. The histologic grade of pros-
tate cancer is an important factor, if not the most
important, for the prognosis of clinically localized prostate
cancer. For over 40 years, the Gleason system has been the
most commonly accepted practice standard for prostate
cancer grading. The Gleason system scores the primary and
secondary patterns of cancer from 1 to 5, and the Gleason
score is the sum of the 2 patterns (eg, 3 1 3 5 6). In recent
years, the World Health Organization and the Internation-
al Society for Urologic Pathology formalized changes to the
Gleason system and the adoption grade groups for prostate
cancer based on published data from several thousand pros-
tate cancers treated surgically and by radiation therapy. The
grade groups are now numbered from 1 to 5, where grade
group 1 is similar to �3 1 3 5 6 tumors, grade group 2 is
similar to 3 1 4 5 7 tumors, grade group 3 is similar to 4
1 3 5 7 tumors; grade group 4 is similar to Gleason sum
8 tumors, and grade group 5 is similar to Gleason sum 9
and 10 tumors.2,3 The current eighth edition uses group
grade given its superior prognostic value.
The third major change is a revision to the prognostic
stage grouping, in which stage III will now include select,
organ-confined disease based on PSA and Gleason/grade

 group status, albeit with minor modifications to be more
consistent with risk categorizations used in clinical treat-
ment guidelines, such as those of the National Comprehen-
sive
Cancer
Network
and
the
American
Urological
Association.
An interesting observation from a global staging princi-
ple perspective is that, with the inclusion of nonanatomic
factors in prostate cancer (grade groups and serum PSA),
the prognostic stage group III includes some organ-
confined prostate cancers. This is in contrast to stage
groupings in most other cancers, where AJCC prognostic
stage group III is invariably associated with nonorgan-
confined disease. However, there is precedence for the stage
III designation of organ-confined disease in other solid
tumor types that takes into account the established impact
of tumor grade (eg, mitotic rate in gastrointestinal stromal
tumor)
and
location/multifocality
(eg,
hepatocellular
carcinoma).
As the fourth major change, the eighth edition has
adopted a strategy to include statistical prediction models
for select cancers. Over time, more cancers will be evaluat-
ed; and, when satisfactory statistical prediction models are
identified, they will be provided and continually updated on
the AJCC Web site (cancerstaging.org). Prostate cancer
risk-assessment models, along with models for lung cancer,
breast cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, and soft
tissue sarcoma, were evaluated by the Precision Medicine
Core for the eighth edition of the AJCC Staging Manual.
Evaluations were based and recommendations were made
only if models met stringent inclusionary and exclusionary
criteria proposed by the Precision Medicine Core,4 which
performed a systematic search of published literature for
prognostic models in prostate cancer from January 2011 to
December 2015. Fifteen prognostic models in prostate can-
cer were identified, but only 2 of the 15 models met all pre-
defined AJCC inclusion and exclusion criteria and are
endorsed by the AJCC.5,6 Both of these models were based
on data from large phase 3 trials in the setting of castrate-
resistant, metastatic disease and were externally validated
(see Table 2).5,6 In the localized prostate cancer models,
the primary reason for exclusion of all 9 was the use of an
outcome other than overall survival. Although another end-
point in the localized disease setting may be appropriate,
the present AJCC guidelines focus on the use of overall
survival as the outcome of interest.
Pathological Considerations
Histologic examination of prostatic adenocarcinoma, most
commonly in a radical prostatectomy specimen, is required
for pathologic TNM stage classification. The major change
to pathologic evaluation in the eighth edition is the elimi-
nation of pT2 substaging, a decision based on both the
problems with practical application of laterality determina-
tion by pathologists and data on the relative prognostic pre-
dictive value of cancer volume versus pT2 substage.
Pathologists were often faced with delineation of an arbi-
trary midline for determining bilaterality of prostate cancer.
Because of this, by past criteria, a very small posterior
tumor that crossed the midline would be classified as higher
stage than a much larger tumor that was confined to one
side.7 Even more importantly, emerging data strongly sug-
gest that a true volume measurement is more prognostically
important than pT2 substage.8–10 pT3 substaging remains
the same as in the seventh edition, but pathologists were
provided with more guidance as to the histologic definition
of “extraprostatic” tissue in various anatomic regions. It is
also suggested that a method for the quantification of
extraprostatic extension be used, such as the classification as
“focal” or “established (nonfocal).”11 pN and pM category
assignment is also unchanged.
In the eighth edition, it is recommended that both the
Gleason grade and the grade group should be used to deter-
mine tumor grade. Although the group grade system is
unique and not directly relatable to Gleason score, the 2
can be generally related as follows: grade group 1 (�
Gleason score 6), grade group 2 (Gleason score 3 1 4 5 7),

 grade group 3 (Gleason score 4 1 3 5 7), grade group 4
(Gleason score 4 1 4 5 8, 3 1 5 5 8, 5 1 3 5 8), and
grade group 5 (Gleason score 9-10). This grade group sys-
tem has several notable advantages. First, in modern patho-
logic grading, Gleason score 6 (3 1 3) is the lowest grade
reported, although the scale historically was from 2 to 10.
A system that now begins with grade group 1 more accu-
rately and more clearly reflects the lowest grade and the
biologically
least aggressive cancers, perhaps assisting
patients and providers as they consider observational strate-
gies such as active surveillance. Second, Gleason sum 7 is
clearly not homogeneous in morphology or biologic behav-
ior, in that 3 1 4 5 7 (grade group 2) has a much better
prognosis than 4 1 3 5 7 (grade group 3); now, there is
division among the Gleason sum 7 cancers that may have
implications in treatment strategies, in particular with
patients who pursue radiation therapy. Finally, Gleason
8 to 10 tumors were often considered as one category of
high-grade disease; however, evidence also indicates that
Gleason score 8 (grade group 4) tumors should be separated
from Gleason 9 and 10 (grade group 5) tumors based on
substantially different prognostic value. The grade group
system
is
now
supported
by
validation
in
multiple
cohorts.12–15
Finally, there is a continued recommendation for consis-
tent processing and reporting of standard pathologic
parameters in prostate cancer according to the College of
American Pathologists’ prostate protocols.16 Specifically,
the importance of reporting margin status and histologic
subtype is emphasized.
Radiologic Considerations
Imaging tests can provide useful staging information in
prostate cancer. For clinical T categorization (cT), the most
valuable modality is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
using high-resolution T2 images. This method provides
the most accurate demarcation of the extent of the primary
tumor. Although MRI provides the best information
among all imaging methods regarding extraprostatic exten-
sion, it has proven insufficiently sensitive to justify routine
use in all but higher risk tumors.17,18 MRI has proven more
useful in evaluating for seminal vesicle invasion), and MRI-
guided biopsies can be obtained to confirm the presence of
seminal vesicle invasion.17,18
For N categorization, computed tomography (CT) or
MRI images of the pelvis are often obtained. However,
nodal staging with CT or MRI notoriously underesti-
mates the extent of nodal involvement because involved
lymph nodes are often smaller than the 0.8 to 1 cm short
axis size criteria for positivity.19 Thus, in high-risk can-
cers, CT or MRI may be more useful in identifying
enlarged lymph nodes because of a higher positive
predictive value; whereas, for intermediate-risk tumors in
which the positive lymph nodes are smaller, the positive
predictive value is lower.
For M categorization, technetium-99m bone scan-
ning continues to be a well accepted standard imaging
method given the propensity of prostate cancer to form
osteoblastic metastases in the bone. More recently,
sodium fluoride (NaF) positron emission tomography
(PET)-CT has been introduced as a more sensitive
method of detecting prostate cancer bone metastases;
however, there is also lower specificity (a higher risk of
false-positive results). This test is most useful when the
conventional bone scan is negative but the clinical sus-
picion of bone metastases is high. For instance, in men
with high-risk tumors who have negative conventional
imaging, the NaF PET-CT may reveal metastases, thus
modifying patient management. Confirmation of NaF-
imaged lesions by MRI is advised when the bone scan
and CT are negative and there is no other explanation
for the uptake (eg, trauma, degenerative disease). Oth-
erwise, in most cases, a bone scan is sufficient for
detecting bone metastases, and the increased sensitivity
of NaF PET-CT is not needed.20 For the detection of
visceral metastases, conventional CT and MRI have
proven satisfactory, although it is rare for visceral mani-
festations to present at initial staging.
TNM Evaluation
T
Prostate cancer does not occur uniformly throughout the
prostate. Although cancers of the prostate often are multi-
focal, from 80% to 85% arise from the peripheral zone, 10%
to 15% arise from the transition zone, and 5% to 10% arise
from the central zone. The peripheral zone is located poste-
riorly, abutting the rectum, and is amenable to DRE and
biopsy by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance. The
transition zone comprises the anteromedial prostate and is
not routinely sampled with a systematic TRUS-guided
biopsy. Patients who have suspected cancer involving the
anterior prostate, such as those with a negative TRUS
biopsy and persistently rising PSA, may be good candidates
for a saturation biopsy or MRI-guided biopsy. The central
zone comprises part of the base of the prostate and the area
surrounding the ejaculatory ducts and is seldom the source
of cancer but often is invaded by the extension of larger
cancers arising in the peripheral zone.
N
The regional lymph nodes are the nodes of the true pelvis,
which essentially are the pelvic lymph nodes below the
bifurcation of the common iliac arteries. They include the
CA CANCER J CLIN 2017;67:245–253
VOLUME 67 _ NUMBER 3 _ MAY/JUNE 2017
249
 following groups: pelvic, hypogastric, obturator, iliac, and
sacral (lateral, presacral, or promontory [ie, Gerota]).
M
Distant lymph nodes lie outside the confines of the true
pelvis. The distant lymph nodes include the following: aor-
tic, common iliac, deep inguinal, superficial inguinal (ie,
femoral), supraclavicular, cervical, scalene, and retroperito-
neal. Bones are the most common nonnodal sites of pros-
tate cancer metastasis; these lesions are usually osteoblastic
rather than osteolytic. Lung and liver metastases usually are
identified late in the course of the disease.
Classification
Table 3 shows the definitions for clinical and pathological
T, N, and M classifications.
Clinical
In healthy men suspected of having prostate cancer because of
either an abnormal DRE or an elevated PSA test, a transrectal
needle biopsy of the prostate gland usually is performed, with
ultrasound guidance, to obtain histologic confirmation of
prostate carcinoma. Much less commonly, prostate cancer
may be diagnosed because of a transurethral resection of pros-
tate performed to relieve obstructive symptoms.
Assigning the clinical T category (cT) is accomplished
using information from the DRE of the prostate and
should always reflect DRE findings only. Masses of the
peripheral zone may feel like distinct and solid nodularity.
Deeper lesions may require firm palpation to detect and
also can be associated with glandular asymmetry and/or
induration. Signs of extraprostatic extension on DRE
include an irregular, gritty texture of the overlying capsule
or flattening of the lateral sulcus. Apical extraprostatic
extension can be subtler. The seminal vesicles may not
always be palpable, but extension into the seminal vesicle
can be palpated as a firm protrusion from the prostate at
the base associated with a large mass. Imaging, such as
ultrasound or MRI, and biopsy information, such as the
laterality of involvement or estimates of tumor volume, are
not recommended for T categorization. To be recom-
mended in clinical staging, evaluations will need to be uni-
versally accessible and well standardized to avoid stage
migration without an associated change in prognostication.
Enlarged lymph nodes can occasionally be observed on
CT or MRI; however, fewer patients are initially discovered
with clinically evident metastatic disease. In patients with
small, low-grade tumors, imaging tests to detect metastatic
disease have not been proven to be helpful and are not
recommended.
The histologic grade of the prostate cancer is important
for prognosis. It is recommended that both the Gleason

 score and the grade group be reported together. The serum
PSA level completes the clinical assessment and, together
with TNM and group grade, an AJCC prognostic stage
group (see Table 4) can be defined.
Pathological
Assigning the pathological T (pT) category is accomplished
in radical prostatectomy specimens. The basic boundary of
the prostate is a condensed fibromuscular layer of prostatic
stroma, the “capsule,” that is best recognized in posterior
and posterolateral aspects of the gland, but not in the apex,
anterior, or bladder neck regions. Even in regions with a
well defined capsule, tumor-related or biopsy-related fibrous
change may cause difficulty in the evaluation of extrapro-
static extension. Microscopic bladder neck invasion (ie,
tumor detected in bladder neck/proximal margin sections) is
classified as pT3a.
Pelvic lymph node dissection is the standard means for
staging (pN) lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer.
Common Clinical Questions
A common question involving the clinical cT category is:
What is the most appropriate category for a tumor that is
found in one or both lobes by needle biopsy, but is not pal-
pable or visible by imaging? It is important to remember
that there is no laterality specification for cT1 tumors; and,
regardless of side or bilateral involvement, this situation is
classified as cT1c.
Another common question is: What is the appropriate
cN category if a patient does not have imaging? Consider a
patient with a PSA of 8 ng/mL and group grade 1 disease
who is found to have cT2a disease, in which the risk of
lymph node involvement is very low. The physician may
use judgment to assign cN0 based on the low probability of
nodal involvement without imaging to assign it. If the risk
of nodal involvement is high and imaging is not performed,
then cNX would be appropriate.
The most appropriate pathological staging for patients
who do not undergo radical prostatectomy is another com-
mon question. Without undergoing a prostatectomy or
additional biopsy procedures, there is insufficient tissue to
assess the pathological stage, and a pathological stage
should not be assigned. The pT, pN, pM and pathologic
stage groups are not completed. If however, a biopsy is per-
formed and confirms a regional lymph node metastasis,
then a pN1 category can be assigned, and the pathological
stage is cT pN1 cM stage IVA. Similarly, if the patient has
biopsy-proven distant metastasis, then pM1 is used, and
the pathological stage is assigned as cT cN pM1 stage IVB.
Another common question involves the assignment of
pN category when no lymph nodes are removed with the
prostatectomy. The assignment is pNX if no lymph nodes
are removed with the prostatectomy. The pT is assigned,
then pNX, and the cM is assigned, but the stage group is
unknown and cannot be assigned.
The diagnosis of a positive apical surgical margin com-
monly raises a question. If fat is not present in the apical

 section, but tumor is present at the surgical margins, then
the appropriate staging would be pT2.21 Some uropathology
experts designate such cases as pT3, the rationale being that,
if the urologist has gone as far wide and distal as possible
and only malignant glands are seen at the margins, then the
tumor should be considered extraprostatic. Rarely, fat may
be present at the apex of the prostatectomy specimen, and
the presence of tumor in adipose tissue at this site indicates
pT3 disease.22
Areas for Further Research
There are several promising imaging methods on the
horizon that may improve the staging of prostate cancer
in the near future. Prime among these is the prostate-
specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-CT. A series
of high-affinity gallium-68–labeled and fluorine-18 (F-
18)–labeled ligands have been developed that bind
PSMA, an antigen expressed in prostate cancers and
their metastases.23 Thus, PSMA PET-CT is a promis-
ing method for both lymph node and bony staging.
Other agents in the same category include F-18 choline
and anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carbox-
ylic acid (F-18-FACBC), both of which target prostate
cancer, although they do not appear to be as sensitive in
head-to-head trials as PSMA PET-CT.24 However,
because none of these are yet widely available, they can-
not be recommended as part of the current standard of
care. Similarly, progress has been made in imaging
lymph nodes with ultrasmall particles of iron oxide
combined with MRI, as normal lymph nodes will take
up the agent and turn dark, but abnormal lymph nodes
will not.25 However, this technique, termed magnetic
resonance lymphography, although able to depict lymph
nodes outside of the normal surgical template, is also
still investigational.25
The primary utility for more sensitive imaging is for
patients considering local therapy, such as surgery or
radiation; for those patients at high risk of failing local
therapy modalities, such as those with high-risk, localized
disease, who are seeking primary treatment; or for those
seeking salvage therapies. Under these circumstances, the
need for better imaging of metastatic disease is most acute.
It is notable that many of the patients imaged with the
newer technologies are diagnosed with oligometastatic dis-
ease. Although exact definitions of oligometastatic are vari-
able,
it
conceptually
represents
an intermediate
step
between localized disease and widespread metastases.26 It is
hypothesized that these patients with oligometastatic dis-
ease may benefit from local therapy.27 It is further hypothe-
sized that eradication of all sites of oligometastatic disease
could result in clinical benefits.28 Trials to investigate these
hypotheses in prostate cancer are ongoing.
Conclusions
The eighth edition of the AJCC TMN Staging Manual
has been updated and improved to ensure the highest
degree of clinical relevance. It no longer subcategorizes
pT2 and now includes grade group, in addition to retaining
the prognostic value of serum PSA and grade group in stag-
ing. The AJCC will continue to critically analyze emerging
prostate cancer biomarkers and tools for their ability to
prognosticate and guide treatment decision making with
the highest level of accuracy and confidence for patients
and physicians. �
