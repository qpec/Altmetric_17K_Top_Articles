Mutations in CHCHD2 have been identified in some Parkinson’s disease (PD) cases. To
understand the physiological and pathological roles of CHCHD2, we manipulated the
expression of CHCHD2 in Drosophila and mammalian cells. The loss of CHCHD2 in Drosophila
causes abnormal matrix structures and impaired oxygen respiration in mitochondria, leading
to oxidative stress, dopaminergic neuron loss and motor dysfunction with age. These
PD-associated phenotypes are rescued by the overexpression of the translation inhibitor
4E-BP and by the introduction of human CHCHD2 but not its PD-associated mutants.
CHCHD2 is upregulated by various mitochondrial stresses, including the destabilization of
mitochondrial genomes and unfolded protein stress, in Drosophila. CHCHD2 binds to
cytochrome c along with a member of the Bax inhibitor-1 superfamily, MICS1, and modulated
cell death signalling, suggesting that CHCHD2 dynamically regulates the functions of
cytochrome c in both oxidative phosphorylation and cell death in response to mitochondrial
stress.

 M
utations in the CHCHD2 gene cause an autosomal
dominant form of late-onset PD1. Several exonic
variants, which may affect the protein levels or
subcellular localization of CHCHD2, have been associated
with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies,
albeit in a study with a limited number of cases2.
The gene product CHCHD2 contains a mitochondrial targeting
sequence
in
the
N-terminus
and
two
cysteine-x9-cysteine
(twin Cx9C) motifs at the C-terminus and has been localized
to the intermembrane space of the mitochondria1,3. Although little
is
known
regarding
the
physiological
and
pathological
roles of CHCHD2, the close homologue CHCHD10 is believed
to regulate crista structure, maintaining the integrity of the
mitochondrial respiratory complexes, at the crista junction of
the intermembrane space4. A study of yeast CHCHD2 ortholog
Mic17 indicated that the loss of Mic17 decreased oxygen
consumption and altered activities in respiratory complexes III
(ubiquinol-cytochrome c [Cyt c] reductase) and IV (Cyt c oxidase)
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae5, whereas an oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) computational expression screen using mouse and
human microarray data revealed that CHCHD2 is required for the
OXPHOS function in mammalian cells6. Further functional
analysis has indicated that the loss of CHCHD2 destabilizes
complex IV, which reduces oxygen consumption and complex IV
activity but not complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase)
activity6. Another study suggested that CHCHD2 positively
regulates the function of complex IV through direct binding
and transcriptional regulation of the complex IV subunit-4
isoform COX4I2 (ref. 3). It has also been suggested that
CHCHD2 inhibits apoptosis through suppression of Cyt c release
by binding to Bcl-xL7.
Dysregulation of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes
generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to oxidative
stress and affects the survival and function of neurons8,9.
Insulin/IGF
signalling
is
a
key
signalling
pathway
that
maintains
mitochondrial
activity10,
and
the
downstream
components of insulin/IGF signalling, FoxO and the FoxO
target eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) regulate mitochondrial
functions and aging in Drosophila11,12. Indeed, 4E-BP, which
suppresses cap-dependent protein translation through binding
to eIF4E, has been shown to have neuroprotective roles against
various stresses in Drosophila PD models13–17.
To understand the physiological and pathological roles of
CHCHD2 in vivo, we established CHCHD2 mutant flies because
fly models harbouring PD genes associated with mitochondrial
functions exhibit pronounced mitochondrial phenotypes and
have greatly contributed to the understanding of PD gene
functions. Here, we report that the loss of CHCHD2 in flies
leads to mitochondrial and neuronal phenotypes associated with
PD pathology, including increased sensitivity to oxidative stress
and loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons with age. These
phenotypes are rescued by 4E-BP and human CHCHD2 but
not by CHCHD2 mutants found in PD cases. Our study suggests
that mutations of CHCHD2 have a loss-of-function aspect in PD,
exacerbating oxidative stress and cell death signalling.
Results
Generation of CHCHD2 loss-of-function
flies. CHCHD2
orthologs are present in various species, including worm, yeast,
and plants, and the affected amino acids found in PD cases are
mildly conserved among these species (Supplementary Fig. 1a)5.
We targeted Drosophila CHCHD2 (dCHCHD2) and generated
hypomorphic dCHCHD2H43 and revertant alleles by imprecise
and precise excision, respectively, using the artificial transposon
p{EPgy2}EY05234 (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). The expression of
dCHCHD2 transcripts in dCHCHD2H43 was reduced to B8.5% of
the level associated with the revertant allele (Supplementary
Fig. 1d). Western blot analysis revealed that expression of the
dCHCHD2 protein was almost abrogated in dCHCHD2H43
homozygous flies (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1e). We also
generated a dCHCHD2 null allele (dCHCHD2 � / �) mutant,
which lacks the coding region of dCHCHD2, using CRISPR/Cas9
technology
and
confirmed
that
the
protein
expression
disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1e–g). Although
dCHCHD2H43 and dCHCHD2 � / � flies were grossly normal,
emerging from pupae at the expected Mendelian ratio, the
mitochondrial morphology in the indirect flight muscles were
affected.
The
structure
of
mitochondrial
cristae
became
disordered in 14-day-old dCHCHD2H43 homozygous flies, and
a ‘swirling’ phenotype (white arrowheads) and dilatation of
matrix spaces were observed (Fig. 1b,d,e). Similar results were
obtained with 14-day-old dCHCHD2 � / � flies (Supplementary
Movies 1 and 2), and the disintegration of the mitochondrial
cristae progressed in 40-day-old flies (Fig. 1c–e). ATP levels in the
thorax muscles were mildly reduced with age in dCHCHD2H43
flies, and the phenotype was exacerbated in dCHCHD2 � / � flies
because ATP reduction was detected at an earlier stage (Fig. 1f).
Mild atrophy of muscles, irregular arrangement of nuclei
and an increase in TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling
(TUNEL)
-positive
nuclei
were
observed
in
30-day-old
dCHCHD2 � / �
flies (Fig. 1g), whereas an increase in the
number of TUNEL-/tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons
was not detected at a single point in time (Supplementary
Fig. 1h). However, the loss of dCHCHD2 led to a reduction
of TH signals, suggesting that the functions of dopaminergic
neurons declined (Supplementary Fig. 1h). Our histochemical
analyses of dCHCHD2 mutant flies indicate that loss of CHCHD2
affects the maintenance of the mitochondrial crista structure,
which is important for the activity of the mitochondrial
respiratory complex and for muscle cell survival.
CHCHD2 loss leads to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration.
Although dCHCHD2H43 adult flies emerged normally and
showed normal survival at a younger stage, they exhibited shorter
lifespans (Fig. 2a). Oxidative stress is considered a prominent
causal factor of PD, and mutations in PD-associated genes
that regulate mitochondrial functions have been reported to
lead to oxidative stress18–20. dCHCHD2H43 adult flies were
sensitive to oxidative stress from paraquat (Fig. 2b) and hydrogen
peroxide (Fig. 2c), and they exhibited mild sensitivity to
starvation (Fig. 2d). ROS production from mitochondria in
dCHCHD2 � / �
embryonic cells was elevated by 1.77-fold
(Fig. 2e,f). Consistent with the elevated ROS production from
mitochondria, the protein translation regulator 4E-BP was
upregulated at both the transcript and protein levels in the
thorax of dCHCHD2H43 flies (Fig. 2g,h), and upregulation of
4E-BP protein was observed in dCHCHD2 � / � flies (Fig. 2h).
Increased protein oxidation and a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio was
also detected in dCHCHD2 � / � flies (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b).
Conversely, the levels of the ROS scavengers SOD1 and DJ-1b
were not changed in dCHCHD2 � / �
flies (Supplementary
Fig. 2c)21,22. These results suggest that loss of dCHCHD2
causes chronic oxidative stress, overwhelming ROS scavenging
activity in flies13–17.
We next examined the effects of dCHCHD2 loss on the central
nervous system. Consistent with the above evidence that chronic
oxidative stress occurs following loss of dCHCHD2, a lipid
oxidation marker, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), was increased
in both whole brain and central DA neurons of dCHCHD2H43
flies (Fig. 2i). Immunoreactivity of 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine

 (8-OHdG), which is a product of oxidatively damaged DNA
formed by hydroxyl radicals, was also increased in the whole
brain and the PPL1 and PPM3 DA neuron clusters of
dCHCHD2H43 flies (Supplementary Fig. 2d). The age-dependent
loss of DA neurons was observed in the PPL1 cluster of
dCHCHD2H43 adult flies even though no changes were observed
in the TUNEL assay (Fig. 2j,k), and climbing ability, which is
regulated by DA neurons, also declined with age (Fig. 2l)23. Taken
together, these results indicate that loss of CHCHD2 produces
chronic
oxidative
stress,
which
causes
aging-dependent
neurodegeneration in DA neurons.
CHCHD2 is upregulated upon mitochondrial stresses. During
the stress assays using Drosophila, protein levels of dCHCHD2
were markedly changed following mitochondrial stresses (Fig. 3).

 Mitochondrial
genomic
stress
caused
by
mutations
or
overexpression of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase g subunits
and mitochondrial unfolded protein stress induced by truncated
mitochondrial
matrix
protein
ornithine
transcarbamylase
(DOTC) upregulated dCHCHD2 at both the transcript and
protein levels (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 3a)24,25.
Suppression of the mitochondrial respiratory complex subunits
by gene knockdown and loss of PINK1, parkin and DJ-1b also
increased or tended to increase dCHCHD2 protein levels
(Supplementary Fig. 3b,c), suggesting that CHCHD2 is a
mitochondrial stress-responsive protein.
Hyperoxia induces the mitochondrial swirl phenotype and
defects in the Cyt c oxidase complex, which is likely to be
accompanied by oxidative stress and/or dysregulation of the
cristae junctions26,27. We thus examined the effects of CHCHD2
loss on hyperoxia. The mitochondrial cristae of the indirect flight
muscle became disordered when normal flies were exposed to
hyperoxia for 4 days (Fig. 3c,d versus Fig. 1d,e). The phenotype
was further exacerbated in dCHCHD2 mutant flies. Consistent
with the idea that hyperoxia produces oxidative stress, 4E-BP was
upregulated in both normal and mutant flies after hyperoxia
exposure (Fig. 3e). Interestingly, dCHCHD2 expression was
suppressed by hyperoxia (Fig. 3e). These results suggest that
CHCHD2 expression is positively regulated by the reduction in
the metabolic status.
CHCHD2
regulates
mitochondrial
electron
transport.
CHCHD2 has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of
OXPHOS in human cultured cells and yeast6,28, which could be
due to the positive regulation of complex IV activity by the
binding of CHCHD2 (ref. 3). To determine respiratory ability in
the presence or absence of dCHCHD2, we measured the oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) of the mitochondria in combination
with respiratory complex inhibitors. Although we initially used
mitochondria isolated from the flight muscles of adult flies, they
did not work well, consistent with a previous report29. Then, we
employed embryonic cells prepared from dCHCHD2 þ / þ and
dCHCHD2 � / � flies. Consistent with the finding of lower ATP
production in dCHCHD2 mutant flies, a steady OCR was lower in
dCHCHD2 � / �cells without detectable changes in the OXPHOS
proteins (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Treatment with an
inhibitor of ATP synthase, oligomycin, suppressed both OCRs to
the same extent (Fig. 4a,b). Subsequent treatment with a proton
ionophore,
FCCP
(carbonyl
cyanide
4-[trifluoromethoxy]
phenylhydrazone), stimulated maximal OCR, which was lower
in dCHCHD2 � / �cells (Fig. 4a,b). OCR was largely inhibited by
rotenone and antimycin A, indicating that it was derived from
mitochondria (Fig. 4a,b). The extracellular acidification rate
(ECAR) was simultaneously measured as an indicator of
glycolytic activity, and the basal ECAR values of CHCHD2 � / �
flies were almost the same, but lower after FCCP treatment,
compared with a CHCHD2 þ / þ flies, which suggested that lower
OXPHOS activity did not result in activation of glycolysis, at
least in an early stage of embryogenesis (Fig. 4c,d). The results
from the mitochondrial stress tests imply that dCHCHD2 � / �
cells are comparable in proton leak to dCHCHD2 þ / þ cells,
whereas ATP production and spare respiratory capacity are
impaired by the loss of CHCHD2 (Fig. 4e).
The activities of mitochondrial complexes I–IV in mitochon-
dria isolated from the flight muscles of 14-day-old flies were
comparable between the two genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
In addition, we could not detect significant binding between
CHCHD2 and complex IV (Supplementary Fig. 4b). These
results suggest that CHCHD2 maintains a proper electron flow
rate from complexes I and II to complex IV, rather than
activating complex IV in Drosophila, although we cannot
completely exclude the possibility that a very small loss of
OXPHOS enzyme activities results in OCR reduction.
CHCHD2 maintains mitochondrial crista integrity. A close
homologue of CHCHD2, CHCHD10 (identity 58% by ClustalW),
is reported to be enriched at the crista junction4. We thus
searched for the binding partners of CHCHD2 that are involved
in the OXPHOS pathway by mass spectrometry analysis. Among
them, we focused on an inner mitochondrial membrane protein,
MICS1, which has been reported to maintain crista structure and
to negatively regulate Cyt c release by direct binding during
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 5a)30. Because MICS1 contains
several transmembrane domains, it can be solubilized only in
detergent-containing solutions. However, because it was difficult
to detect stable binding between human CHCHD2 (hCHCHD2)
or Cyt c and MICS1 in detergent-containing solutions, probably
due to the unfolding of MICS1 by the removal of the inner
mitochondrial membrane, we used a thiol-cleavable crosslinker
(dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate); DSP) to detect the binding
in their native conformations. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)
293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding
MICS1, hCHCHD2 or Cyt c. We first confirmed the interaction
between MICS1 and hCHCHD2 in mitochondria (Supplementary
Fig. 5b,c). We then examined whether these three proteins
form a tertiary complex in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5a). Cyt c with
a FLAG tag was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads, and
co-precipitated MICS1-HA and hCHCHD2-Myc were detected
in western blots. Under this condition, an unrelated inner
mitochondrial membrane protein, Tim23, was not present in this
complex, indicating that DSP specifically links protein complexes.

 Importantly,
the
amounts
of
co-precipitated
MICS1
with
Cyt c-FLAG were largely unchanged in the presence or
absence of hCHCHD2-Myc and vice versa, suggesting that
MICS1 and CHCHD2 form a tertiary complex with Cyt c rather
than compete for binding of Cyt c (Fig. 5a). Endogenous
interactions of three proteins were also detected (Fig. 5b).
CHCHD2 T61I mutation found in PD cases affected the
binding to MICS1 (Supplementary Fig. 5d)1. Interaction of
CHCHD2 with
Cyt
c
was
unchanged
by
PD mutations
(Supplementary Fig. 5e).
We stably introduced the genes for wild-type (WT) hCHCHD2
and PD mutants (T61I and R145Q) in CHCHD2 � / � mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). WT
hCHCHD2 but not mutants suppressed Cyt c release (Fig. 5c,d)
and caspase activation (Fig. 5e,f) by actinomycin D. More
prominent effects were observed regarding Cyt c release caused
by peroxide (Supplementary Fig. 6c).
Knockdown of the Drosophila MICS1 ortholog dMICS1, the
efficiency of which was B55%, had little effect on mitochondrial
morphology in the dCHCHD2Rev genetic background, whereas it
dramatically degenerated the mitochondrial matrices in the
dCHCHD2H43 background (Fig. 5g,i versus Fig. 1b,e and
Supplementary Fig. 7a). Ubiquitous overexpression of dMICS1
by Da-GAL4 at 25 �C results in death at the 1st instar larval
stage. Reduced expression levels (Da-GAL4 at 22 or 18 �C)
caused reduced hatching efficiency (B10%), slowed growth
and death at the second instar larval stage, whereas the loss of
dCHCHD2 did not affect its developmental phenotype and
hatching efficiency of dMICS1-overexpressing larvae (Suppleme-
ntary
Fig.
7b).
Muscle-specific
overexpression
of
dMICS1
was
viable
and
promoted
mitochondrial
fragmentation
in
both
genetic
backgrounds,
showing
mild
mitochondrial
defects to the same extent (Fig. 5h,i versus Fig. 1b,e). Consistent
with the morphological defects, knockdown of dMICS1 largely
reduced ATP production in dCHCHD2H43 flies (Fig. 5j).
Importantly,
overexpression
of
dMICS1
rescued
the
ATP
reduction and motor defects observed in dCHCHD2H43 flies,
which strongly suggested that MICS1 maintains OXPHOS
function in cooperation with CHCHD2 (Fig. 5j and Suppleme-
ntary Fig. 7c).

 Rescue of fly phenotypes by expression of human CHCHD2.
We next examined whether hCHCHD2 rescues the mitochon-
drial phenotypes observed in dCHCHD2H43 flies. We introduced
LacZ, dCHCHD2 or hCHCHD2, including WT and two mutants,
into dCHCHD2H43 flies; hCHCHD2 WT and mutant genes were
expressed at similar levels (Fig. 6a). Reintroduction of dCHCHD2
and hCHCHD2 WT almost completely rescued the morpholo-
gical defects of mitochondria in the indirect flight muscles,

 whereas the dilatation of matrix space, disordered cristae, and
‘swirl’ phenotype were still observed with a control LacZ,
hCHCHD2 T61I or R145Q (Fig. 6b,c and Supplementary Fig. 8).
Importantly, the age-dependent loss of PPL1 DA neurons
observed in dCHCHD2H43 flies was rescued by hCHCHD2 WT
but not by the mutants T61I or R145Q (Fig. 6d). Consistent with
the rescue of the mitochondrial morphology and the DA neuron
loss, impairment of ATP production, locomotor defects, short
lifespan,
and
sensitivity
to
oxidative
stress
observed
in
dCHCHD2H43 flies were suppressed by dCHCHD2 or hCHCHD2
WT, whereas rescue effects were generally weaker in hCHCHD2
mutants, raising the possibility that these two missense mutations
are loss-of-function mutations (Fig. 6e–g). To test this idea,
hCHCHD2 T61I and R145Q were expressed in dCHCHD2
heterozygous flies. dCHCHD2 heterozygous flies expressing LacZ
exhibited almost normal mitochondrial morphology and showed
slightly decreasing ATP levels compared to a normal control
(Fig. 7a–c). Overexpression of PD-associated mutants did not
produce morphological defects, and ATP levels were comparable
to the heterozygous mutant with LacZ (Fig. 7a–c). We found that
the T61I mutation, which occurs in a central conserved region
(Supplementary Fig. 1a), destabilized the CHCHD2 protein,
leading to its appearance in the insoluble fraction when expressed
in bacteria (Fig. 7d). CHCHD2 formed a homodimer (Fig. 7e).
R145Q, which is located adjacent to the second Cx9C motif
(Supplementary Fig. 1a), affected the dimer formation (Fig. 7e).
These
genetic
and
molecular
analyses
suggest
that
the
two mutations affect the normal functions of CHCHD2 showing
loss-of-function properties.
4E-BP rescues neurodegeneration by loss of CHCHD2. Our
data suggest that loss or mutation of CHCHD2 produces ROS
due to the incomplete OXPHOS activity, leading to oxidative
stress and subsequent neurodegeneration. Supporting this idea, a
compensatory upregulation of 4E-BP, which has a protective role
against oxidative stress maintaining mitochondrial integrity,
was observed in dCHCHD2-deficient flies (Fig. 2g,h)12,14,31.
Overexpressing CHCHD2 and LacZ with the GAL4-UAS system
caused 4E-BP expression to increase slightly, probably due to
GAL4,
LacZ
and/or
CHCHD2
overexpression.
However,
reintroduction of dCHCHD2 at a level similar to endogenous
levels suppressed 4E-BP induction in dCHCHD2-deficient flies
(Fig. 8a and Supplementary Fig. 9a). Under the same expression
conditions as the dCHCHD2 introduction, WT hCHCHD2
successfully suppressed 4E-BP induction in dCHCHD2-deficient
flies, whereas PD mutants failed to do so, suggesting that
mitochondrial stress was alleviated by intact CHCHD2 (Fig. 8a).
We then introduced 4E-BP into dCHCHD2 � / � flies because
4E-BP has multiple beneficial roles in mitochondria. Ubiquitous
expression of 4E-BP lessened the ATP decline in dCHCHD2 � / �
flies (Fig. 8b). A similar effect was obtained by treating
with rapamycin, which activates 4E-BP through inhibition of a
4E-BP kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) (Fig. 8b)17. Consistent
with the effect on ATP, mitochondrial morphology and protein
oxidization
were
also
improved
by
4E-BP
overexpression
(Fig. 8c–e). Dopaminergic and serotoninergic expression of 4E-
BP in dCHCHD2H43 flies extended the lifespan and improved the
motor activity and DA neuron loss to the extent of Rev expressing
LacZ or 4E-BP (Fig. 8f–h).
Although DJ-1 and SOD1 have anti-oxidative activity, we
could not detect an obvious genetic interaction between CHCHD2
and DJ-1 or between CHCHD2 and SOD1 in Drosophila18,22.
Loss of DJ-1 did not exacerbate mitochondrial morphology in
dCHCHD2-deficient flies (Supplementary Fig. 9b). DJ-1 or SOD1
overexpression did not extend the lifespan of dCHCHD2-deficient
flies (Supplementary Fig. 9c,d). In addition, SOD1 failed to
improve the climbing defect, TH neuron loss of dCHCHD2-
deficient flies (Supplementary Fig. 9e,f), suggesting that simple
redox control is not sufficient for mitochondrial protection. We
also tested the genetic association of CHCHD2 with PINK1 and
parkin, both of which are involved in mitochondrial quality
control in the same signalling pathway32. Although dCHCHD2 is
upregulated in PINK1- and parkin-deficient flies, there was no
evidence that loss of CHCHD2 exacerbates the mitochondrial
phenotypes caused by the loss of PINK1 or parkin (Fig. 9a)
or that CHCHD2 regulates mitochondrial size or dynamics, as
observed in PINK1 and Parkin signalling (Fig. 9b). However,
overexpression of PINK1 or Parkin led to much sharper
reductions in ATP and stronger changes in mitochondrial
morphology caused by the loss of dCHCHD2, whereas PINK1
or Parkin overexpression alone promoted the fragmentation of
mitochondria with normal crista integrity (Fig. 9c,d).
Discussion
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature of PD. The
newly identified PD-related gene CHCHD2, which encodes
a mitochondrial protein, could provide new insight into the
aetiology of PD. In this study, we characterized the physiological
and pathological roles of CHCHD2 using Drosophila and mouse
cultured cells. Although CHCHD2-deficient flies and mice
develop
normally,
age-dependent
mitochondrial
defects,
increased oxidative stress, and DA neuron loss were detected in
Drosophila. Previous studies suggest that CHCHD2 has a role in
OXPHOS function. During OXPHOS, electrons are extracted

 from substrates and are then transferred to molecular oxygen
through a chain of enzymatic complexes, I–IV. In the final step,
complex IV (Cyt c oxidase) ensures the reduction of molecular
oxygen to water, without formation of oxygen radicals. CHCHD2
binds to Cyt c in conjunction with MICS1. Cyt c, which transfers
electrons from complex III (ubiquinol-Cyt c reductase) to
complex IV, is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane
space. When apoptotic signalling is activated by proapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax or tBid, Cyt c is released
through the permeabilized mitochondrial outer membrane.
Knockdown of MICS1 and CHCHD2 facilitates Cyt c release
upon treatment with apoptosis-inducing reagents and UV
irradiation7,30. Considering our findings together with the
above studies, we hypothesize that CHCHD2 and MICS1
stabilize Cyt c to maintain normal electron flow during
OXPHOS (Fig. 10). When Cyt c function is compromised,
electron flow from complex III to complex IV is impaired, and
excess electrons from Cyt c may react with molecular oxygen,

 resulting in the production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide,
a
major
cause
of
oxidative
stress.
Supporting
this
idea,
dCHCHD2-deficient flies exhibit various phenotypes associated
with oxidative stress, including increased 4-HNE, 8-OHdG and
protein/GSH oxidization and upregulation of 4E-BP. In these
flies, aging is a key factor in mitochondrial degeneration and DA
neuron loss. An age-related decline in the activity of complex IV,
but not other respiratory complexes, has been reported without
detectable alteration of complex IV protein levels in Drosophila33.
This observation raises the possibility that the function of
complex IV, in addition to that of Cyt c, is compromised in
dCHCHD2-deficient flies as they aged, resulting in a high
incidence of ROS.
Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that chronic
oxidative stress occurs by CHCHD2 loss, overexpression of SOD1
and DJ-1 or removal of DJ-1 did not affect dCHCHD2
phenotypes, which strongly suggests that oxidative stress is only
part of the pathogenesis of PD that is linked to CHCHD2. The
functional difference between SOD1/DJ-1 and 4E-BP is that the
latter regulates mitochondrial functions and proteostasis in
addition to upregulation of anti-oxidative proteins such as
anti-oxidant
GST-S1
(refs
11,12,17,31).
For
mitochondrial
regulation by 4E-BP, it has been demonstrated that 4E-BP is
involved in translational upregulation of complexes I and IV
subunits under dietary restriction, which enhances OXPHOS12.
Another study has proposed that 4E-BP suppresses OXPHOS
proteins and mitochondrial respiration31. We favour the latter
idea because hypoxia improves the mitochondrial defects of
dCHCHD2 flies (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b).
In
sharp
contrast
to
4E-BP
overexpression,
PINK1
or
Parkin overexpression decreased the mitochondrial integrity of
dCHCHD2-deficient flies. According to the hypothesis that
PINK1-Parkin signalling is responsible for mitochondrial quality
control,
PINK1
or
Parkin
overexpression
might
activate
mitophagy. This effect would cause most of the mitochondria
in dCHCHD2-deficient flies to be recognized as damaged
mitochondria, leading to lysosomal degradation. Nevertheless,
given that CHCHD2 responds to a variety of mitochondrial
stresses, including PINK1, parkin and DJ-1 mutations, CHCHD2
could be a potential biomarker of PD associated with mitochon-
drial dysfunction.
Because the mitochondrial respiratory chains are localized at
the cristae, crista structure is closely associated with OXPHOS
activity. CHCHD10 has been reported to be enriched at the crista
junctions, and expression of a CHCHD10 mutant, which causes
frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, led to
fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and defects in crista
structures4. Although our electron microscopic study using
CHCHD2-deficient MEFs did not detect obvious abnormalities
in crista organization
due to a variety of mitochondrial
morphologies in the cytosol (Supplementary Fig. 11), the
lack of dCHCHD2 led to moderate crista deformation in the
indirect flight muscles of Drosophila. Because MICS1 has also
been reported to regulate crista organization30, CHCHD2 along
with MICS1 might maintain crista integrity to accommodate
Cyt c properly.
PD caused by missense mutations in CHCHD2 is inherited
as a dominant trait1. This suggests that neurodegeneration may
be caused by gain-of-function mutations. Our study indicates that
human pathogenic T61I and possible R145Q mutants do not
fully rescue the mitochondrial defects caused by the lack
of dCHCHD2, suggesting that these mutations compromise its
physiological functions. Supporting this idea, we found that
CHCHD2 harbouring PD mutations exhibits reduced solubility
or impaired homodimerization, although it should be determined
whether dimerization is important for its physiological function
in future research. Importantly, the expression of T61I and
R145Q in dCHCHD2 heterozygous flies did not produce
mitochondrial
defects,
which
strongly
suggests
that
the
aetiology of PD linked to CHCHD2 includes a loss-of-function
aspect. However, further studies should determine whether
gain-of-function events are also involved in neurodegeneration
by CHCHD2 mutations.
CHCHD2
levels
were
altered
by
various
mitochondrial
stresses. A previous study showed that CHCHD2 transactivates
COX4I2 and CHCHD2 itself in the nucleus3,34. Thus, the
upregulation of CHCHD2 due to mitochondrial stress might
contribute to the transcriptional regulation of these genes,
resulting in a more complex pathogenesis than we hypothesize
here. Hyperoxia suppressed dCHCHD2 levels in Drosophila,
which suggests that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is involved in
its regulation. However, we could not find the consensus
sequence of the hypoxia-responsive element upstream of the
dCHCHD2
gene.
In
addition,
hypoxia
or
knockdown
of
HIF-1a/Sima or HIF-1�/Tango did not change dCHCHD2
levels (Supplementary Fig. 12). Cyclic adenosine monopho-
sphate response element and a novel oxygen-responsive element
have been proposed as regulation sequences for CHCHD2 gene
expression in mammals3,35. Although we could not find putative
sequences for these elements in the 50-untranslated region of the
dCHCHD2 gene, further analysis is needed to clarify the
involvement of these elements in Drosophila.
In summary, we propose that CHCHD2 controls OXPHOS
through regulation of Cyt c and crista integrity. Loss or mutation
of
CHCHD2
leads
to
oxidative
stress
probably
through
dysregulation of electron flow in OXPHOS. Our study sheds
light on the aetiology of PD linked to CHCHD2 and potential
therapeutic targets in PD caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.

Figure 7 | Biochemical properties of hCHCHD2 are altered in PD mutants. (a) Mitochondrial defects in 14-day-old adult flies, defined as classes 1 and 2
defects, were counted as shown in Fig. 1e (mean±s.e.m.). Transgenes (LacZ, T61I and R145Q) were driven in dCHCHD2 heterozygous flies by Da-GAL4.

expressed hCHCHD2 T61I has difficulty in solubilizing. hCHCHD2 WTand PD mutants were expressed in SHuffle T7 Express Escherichia coli (New England
Biolabs), which promotes disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm. Total lysate (T), phosphate-buffered saline-soluble (S) and insoluble (I) protein
fractions solubilized in SDS sample buffer containing 2% SDS were separated on SDS–PAGE and were visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue staining.
An asterisk indicates insoluble hCHCHD2 T61I, whereas there were no insoluble hCHCHD2 bands in WT and R145Q. (e) hCHCHD2 forms a dimer.
hCHCHD2-expressing MEFs treated with or without 0.5 mg ml � 1 DSP in PBS for 20 min at RT were lysed and subjected to western blot analysis with
anti-CHCHD2. The ratio of monomer signals to total signals was graphed (mean±s.e.m., n ¼ 6 in each group). A monomer form of hCHCHD2 WT and
T61I accounts for less than 50% of total CHCHD2 signals under this experimental condition, whereas the R145Q monomer form was higher
(B60%, *P ¼ 0.027 by one-way ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer test). ANOVA, analysis of variance; TEM, transmission electron microscopy.

Drosophila genetics. Fly culture and crosses were performed on standard fly food
containing yeast, cornmeal, and molasses, and the flies were raised at 25 �C. The
w1118 (w–) or revertant line was used as a WT genetic background. Complementary
DNA (cDNA) for dCHCHD2 or hCHCHD2 was subcloned into the pUAST vector,
and transgenic lines were generated on the w– background (BestGene). For gene
targeting of dCHCHD2, we used conventional mutagenesis by transposon
mobilization of p{EPgy2}EY05234 (Bloomington stock 15790) and generated
a hypomorphic CHCHD2H43 allele and its revertant allele as a WT control. We also
employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a dCHCHD2 null allele using
tandem guide RNA plasmids (pCFD4) and a fly line expressing Cas9 during
oogenesis (Bloomington stock 54591)36. Two protospacers corresponding to
sequences of dCHCHD2 were cloned into pCFD4 digested with BbsI using an
In-fusion HD cloning kit (Takara Bio) with the following primer pairs:

GTCCAGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG-30, 50-ATTTTAACTTGCTATTT-
CTAGCTCTAAAACTCTACTGGAGATGGTGGCTCGACGTTAAATTGAAAA-
TAGGTC-30. To avoid potential off-target mutations generated by Cas9, the
dCHCHD2-deficient line was backcrossed to the w � background for six
generations, and w � was used as a WT allele.
All other fly stocks and GAL4 lines used in this study were obtained from the
Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, Vienna Drosophila Resource Center, Kyoto
Stock Center, NIG-fly (National Institute of Genetics, Japan), FlyORF and have
been previously described: UAS-PolGIII (ref. 24); UAS-OTC and UAS-DOTC25;

Whole-mount immunostaining and electron microscopy analysis. The
mitochondrial morphology of the indirect flight muscles and the number of
TH-positive neurons were analysed by whole-mount immunostaining as previously
described20. Transmission electron microscopy images were obtained at the
Laboratory of Ultrastructural Research of Juntendo University and Tokai Electron
Microscopy, Inc. Abnormal mitochondria were counted and graded in a blind
manner by C.Y. and H.M.
TUNEL assay and muscle histochemistry. The thorax samples embedded in
paraffin blocks were sectioned from the lateral side at a thickness of 3 mm, and the
serial sections were used for TUNEL assays, which made use of an in situ cell death
detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were also used for toluidine blue staining.
Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy tomography. The indirect
flight muscles of 14-day-old flies were subjected to focused ion beam scanning
electron microscopy analysis using a Helios 660 dual-beam microscope (FEI). Epon
blocks of tissue samples were repeatedly milled through focused ion beam in 20 nm
steps, and the block face was imaged via scanning electron microscopy at an
acceleration voltage of 3.0 kV using back-scatter electron signals. The acquired
images were processed using Photoshop (Adobe Systems) to adjust the contrast
and were converted to movies at 5 frames per second using ImageJ.
ATP measurements. The ATP content in the thorax muscles of Drosophila was
measured as previously described41. Briefly, the thoraxes homogenized in 20 ml of
homogenization buffer (6 M guanidine-HCl, 100 mM Tris and 4 mM EDTA
(pH 7.8)) were centrifuged at 16,000 g. The supernatants diluted 1:1,000 and
1:10 with water were subjected to measurements of ATP concentrations and
protein concentrations, respectively. ATP and protein concentrations were
determined using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega)
and the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), respectively.
Western blot analysis. Fly heads and thoraxes homogenized in 40 ml of 3 � SDS
sample buffer using a motor-driven pestle were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min
and the supernatants were subjected to western blotting. For gene induction by
Gene-Switch system, newly eclosing flies carrying the Da-GS driver were cultured
with normal fly food containing various concentrations of RU486 for 3 days, and
the gene induction was analysed in the thoraxes by western blot analysis as
previously described41. Uncropped images of the western blotting are displayed in
Supplementary Figs 13–15.
OxyBlot assay and GSH/GSSG measurement. For detection of protein
oxidation, an OxyBlot Protein Oxidation Detection Kit (Merck Millipore) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The band intensity was analysed
using ImageJ software. GSH/GSSG ratios from twenty male flies were measured
by using a glutathione assay kit (Cayman Chemical), following a protocol provided
by the manufacturer.
Plasmids and cell culture. Human CHCHD2 cDNAs were inserted in the
pcDNA3 vector containing FLAG or Myc-His tag and in the pMXs-puro vector,
followed by sequencing of the entire gene. Expression vectors for MICS1-HA and
Cyt c-FLAG were a kind gift from Dr T. Oka. MEFs were retrovirally transfected
with pMXs-puro harbouring hCHCHD2, and the transfected cells were then
selected with 1 mg ml � 1 puromycin. The source of HEK293T cells was described
elsewhere43 and HeLa cells were purchased from RIKEN cell bank. They are
maintained at 37 �C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco), GlutaMax
(Gibco), non-essential amino acids (Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The
plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (ThermoFisher
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total amount of
transfected cDNA was adjusted with vector DNA in every transfection experiment.
All the cells used here were tested and negative for mycoplasma contamination.
Identification of CHCHD2-binding proteins and binding assay. For
identification of CHCHD2-binding proteins, HEK293T cells expressing
C-terminally FLAG-tagged human CHCHD2 were homogenized in cell lysis buffer
(20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.5%
digitonin, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mg ml � 1 leupeptin, 5 mg ml � 1 aprotinin and 3 mg ml � 1
pepstatin A). CHCHD2-FLAG was purified from the cell lysate with anti-FLAG
M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) and eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich).
The elution fraction was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and
subsequent digestion with lysyl endopeptidase (Lys-C, Wako Chemicals USA).
Samples were analysed on a liquid chromatography system coupled to a
time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-STAR XL, AB Sciex)44.
For co-immunoprecipitation assay using chemical crosslinker, cells were
harvested and washed twice with PBS and then incubated with 0.5 mg ml � 1 DSP
(ThermoFisher Scientific) at 25 �C for 15–20 min. After washing with TBS, the cells
were solubilized at 4 �C for 30 min in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS) and then centrifuged to remove
insoluble precipitates. The resultant supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG or
anti-Myc beads (Medical & Biological Laboratories) for 3 h at 4 �C, washed twice
with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and then washed once with PBS alone.
The precipitates were subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE) and subsequent western blot analysis.
Preparation of MEFs from CHCHD2-deficient mice. CHCHD2 � / � mice were
generated by Unitech in Japan. In brief, the targeting vector was constructed to
replace exons 2 and 3 with the neomycin resistance gene. The targeting vector was
introduced into C57BL/6 embryonic stem (ES) cells by electroporation. After
selection with G418, ES clones were subject to PCR screening and Southern
blotting to identify homologous recombinant clones. Recombinant ES cells were

 microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to obtain chimeric mice, which were then
mated to generate heterozygous and homozygous mice. Animal protocols were
performed in accordance with the Juntendo University Animal Experiment
Committee. CHCHD2 � / � MEFs were prepared from embryos at 13.5–15.5 d.p.c.
and were cultured at 37 �C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM containing with
GlutaMax, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, gentamicin (50 mg ml � 1;
Gibco), and 1% non-essential amino acids.
Cyt c release and caspase assay. MEFs treated with 500 nM actinomycin D or
50 nM peroxide were suspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer (220 mM
mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA and protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche)), then homogenized by 20 passages through a 26-G
syringe (Terumo) on ice45. Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 g for 10 min at
4 �C to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant. The post-nuclear supernatant was
further centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min. Pellets were washed several times
with the mitochondrial isolation buffer. Caspase activity was estimated with a
Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit (Promega) or western blot with anti-cleaved caspase-3.
Coupling assay of mitochondria in Drosophila embryonic cells. Drosophila
embryos (B800 in each) at the blastoderm stage collected 2–3 h post laying at
25 �C were dechorionated with 40% bleach for 2 min. Embryos were then
homogenized in Schneider’s insect medium containing 5% FCS using a Dounce
tissue homogenizer by 10–12 up and down strokes with a loose pestle. Embryonic
cells filtered with a 40-mm cell strainer were plated onto 24-well XF cell culture
microplates (Seahorse Bioscience) pre-coated with Cell-Tak (Corning) at 80,000
cells per well and were subjected to a MitoStress test using the XF24 analyser
(Seahorse Bioscience) at 29 �C.
MitoSOX analysis in Drosophila embryonic cells. Drosophila embryonic cells
prepared as described above were stained with 20 mM MitoSOX (ThermoFisher
Scientific) and 1 mg ml � 1 Hoechst 33342 for 20 min at RT. Fluorescence intensities
of MitoSOX in cells (1 � 104) were measured using LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences),
and Hoechst 33342-positive cells were analysed using FlowJo version 9 (TreeStar).
Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activity assay. Mitochondria from the
thoracic muscles of 14-day-old adult flies were isolated by a reported protocol with
some modifications33. Briefly, isolated thoraces from 20 flies were gently crushed in
200 ml of ice-cold isolation buffer (320 mM sucrose, 10 mM EDTA and 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.3) using a plastic pestle homogenizer and then spun twice at 500 g
for 5 min at 4 �C to remove debris. After centrifugation for 10 min at 2,200 g,
the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of isolation buffer. The activities of
complexes I–IV were measured following a previously reported protocol, which
was adapted to the 96-well plate scale46,47. Briefly, for the measurement of the
complex I activity, NADH dehydrogenase assay buffer (50 mM potassium
phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 2.5 mg ml � 1 bovine serum albumin [BSA], 240 mM KCN,
70 mM decylubiquinone [dUb], 25 mM antimycin A) containing 2 mM rotenone or
ethanol was divided into 100 ml aliquots in a microplate and left at RT for 5 min.
Complex I activity was monitored by adding 0.4 mg of mitochondrial preparations
and 200 mM NADH (2 mM NADH stock) to the reaction mix and following
a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (with reference wavelength at 425 nm). For the
measurement of the complex II activity, succinate dehydrogenase assay buffer
(25 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 2 mg ml � 1 BSA, 20 mM potassium
succinate, 60 mM 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, 25 mM antimycin A, 2 mM KCN,
2 mM rotenone) with or without 10 mM malonic acid was divided into 100 ml
aliquots in a microplate and left at RT for 5 min. Complex II activity was
monitored by adding 0.4 mg of mitochondrial samples and 100 mM dUb to the
reaction mix and following a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. For the
measurement of the complex III activity, cytochrome c reductase assay buffer
(50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 1 mM n-dodecyl b-D-maltoside
[DDM], 1 mM KCN, 2 mM rotenone, 250 mM EDTA, and 1 mg ml � 1 BSA, 50 mM
oxidized cytochrome c) with or without 25 mM antimycin A was divided into 100 ml
aliquots in a microplate and left at RT for 5 min. The cytochrome c reductase
activity was monitored by adding 200 mM decylubiquinol, and 0.075 mg of
mitochondrial samples to the reaction mix and following an increase in absorbance
at 550 nm. For the measurement of the complex IV activity, cytochrome c oxidase
buffer (25 mM potassium phosphate pH7.0, 0.45 mM DDM and 100 mM reduced
cytochrome c) with or without 2 mM KCN was divided into 100 ml aliquots in a
microplate. The cytochrome c oxidase activity was monitored by adding 0.1 mg of
mitochondrial samples to the reaction mix and following a decrease in
absorbance at 550 nm. Each activity was evaluated by subtracting the activity
in the presence of specific complex inhibitors, including rotenone, malonic acid,
antimycin A and KCN.
Binding assay of CHCHD2 to complex IV. Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) were transfected with an expression plasmid for full-length human
CHCHD2 c-terminally tagged with a PA tag48 according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The cells from a 50 ml culture were lysed via sonication in lysis buffer
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton-X
and cOmplete Ultra protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), followed by centrifugation
at 27,216 g for 15 min. The supernatant (10 ml in total) was incubated with 100 ml
of anti-PA tag NZ-1-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 �C, and the beads were sequentially
washed with 1 ml of wash buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM
NaCl, 10% glycerol, followed by 1 ml of interaction buffer containing
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 0.2% n-decyl-b-D-
maltopyranoside (DM) (Anatrace, D322). The CHCHD2-bound beads were
incubated in the presence or absence of 306 mg of purified bovine heart complex IV
(provided by Dr Tsukihara) for 1.5 h at 4 �C and washed twice with 1 ml of the
interaction buffer. Co-precipitated proteins were eluted with SDS-containing
buffer and analysed via SDS–PAGE and subsequent Coomassie Brilliant Blue
(CBB) staining or western blotting with anti-complex IV subunit IV (Abcam,
20E8C12).
Quantitative PCR. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA content was performed by
quantitative PCR (qPCR) on a 7500 Fast real-time cycler (Applied Biosystems,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the EXPRESS SYBR GreenER qPCR Supermix kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Specific primers for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA;
Fw primer: 50-CAACCATTCATTCCAGCCTT-30; Rev primer: 50-GAAAATTT-
TAAATGGCCGCA-30) were designed as previously reported25. The relative levels
of mitochondrial DNA were normalized to nuclear DNA using primers for actin
(Dm_Act79B, QuantiTect Primer Assay, Qiagen). For reverse transcription
(RT)-qPCR analyses, the isolation of total RNA was performed using Sepasol-RNA
I Super G (Nacalai Tesque). RT was performed using a SuperScript VILO cDNA
Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific), and subsequent qPCR was performed
using the EXPRESS SYBR GreenER qPCR Supermix kit with the following primers
(dCHCHD2 Fw primer: 50-TCCACTCGTCGCACCGCACCTGTG-30; dCHCHD2
Rev primer: 50-ACGGCACTGGGAGGAGCGCTCATG-30; dMICS1 Fw primer:
50-GCTCAACATCTTTATCCGCATC-30; dMICS1 Rev primer: 50-CACCTTAA-
ACCAACTCAGTTCTTC-30; RP49 Fw primer: 50-ACTTCATCCGCCACCA-
GTCG-30; RP49 Rev primer: 50-CGGGTGCGCTTGTTCGATCC-30). The relative
transcript levels of the target genes were normalized against RP49 mRNA levels.
Quantification was performed using the comparative Ct method.
Survival assay and climbing assay. For the lifespan studies, B20 adult flies per
vial (25 mm diameter � 95 mm height) were maintained at 25 �C, transferred to
fresh fly food, and scored for survival every 4 days. To control for isogeny, we used
dCHCHD2H43 and its revertant for comparison or we crossed dCHCHD2H43
and the revertant with driver and transgenic lines that were backcrossed to the
w � background for six generations or generated in the w � background. For the
oxidative stress assays, the survival rate of 3-day-old male adult flies kept in a vial
containing tissue paper soaked with 0.5% H2O2 or 2 mM paraquat prepared in
Schneider’s insect medium was measured as described16. Starvation assay was
performed with distilled water instead of toxins. For a climbing assay, vials
(25 mm diameter � 180 mm height) containing 20–25 flies were tapped gently on
the table and left standing for 18 seconds. The number of flies that climbed at least
60 mm was recorded.
Exposure to hyperoxia. Adult males (1–2-day-old) in plastic vials (20–25 flies per
vial) containing laboratory-standard food were placed in an atmosphere chamber
at room temperature supplied with 90% O2 balanced by nitrogen. Each experiment
was conducted on at least 50 flies of a given genotype. Flies were removed after
4 days for EM studies and western blot analysis.
Statistical analysis. Two-tailed student’s t-test or a one-way repeated measures
analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences between two or
among multiple groups, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. If a significant
result was determined using analysis of variance (Po0.05), the mean values of the
control and the specific test group were analysed using a Tukey–Kramer test.
Dunnett’s test were used to determine significant differences between two specific
groups or among multiple groups of interests. Data distribution was assumed to be
normal, but this was not formally tested. With the exception of collecting data for
Drosophila mitochondrial phenotypes, data collection and analysis were not
performed blind to the conditions of the experiments and no randomization
was used.
