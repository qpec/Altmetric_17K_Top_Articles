Severe asthma is a discrete clinical entity characterised by recurrent exacerbations, reduced quality of life
and poor asthma control as ordinary treatment regimens remain inadequate. Difficulty in managing severe
asthma derives partly from the multiple existing phenotypes and our inability to recognise them. Though
the exact pathogenetic pathway of severe allergic asthma remains unclear, it is known that numerous
inflammatory cells and cytokines are involved, and eosinophils represent a key inflammatory cell mediator.
Anti-IgE (omalizumab) and anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) antibodies are biological agents that interfere in
different steps of the Th2 inflammatory cascade and are licensed in severe asthma. Both exhibit a favourable
clinical outcome as they reduce exacerbation rate and improve asthma control and quality of life, while
mepolizumab also induces an oral steroid sparing effect. Nevertheless, it is still questionable which agent is
more suitable in the management of severe allergic asthma since no comparable studies have been conducted.
Omalizumab’s established effectiveness in clinical practice over a long period is complemented by a beneficial
effect on airway remodelling process mediated mainly through its impact on eosinophils and other parameters
strongly related to eosinophilic inflammation. However, it is possible that mepolizumab through nearly
depleting eosinophils could have a similar effect on airway remodelling. Moreover, to date, markers indica-
tive of the patient population responding to each treatment are unavailable although baseline eosinophils
and exacerbation rate in the previous year demonstrate a predictive value regarding anti-IL-5 therapy
effectiveness. On the other hand, a better therapeutic response for omalizumab has been observed when low
forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and increased IgE concentrations are
present. Consequently, conclusions are not yet safe to be drawn based on existing knowledge, and additional
research is necessary to unravel the remaining issues for the severe asthmatic population.

A
sthma is a heterogeneous disease characterised
by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by
a history of symptoms including wheeze, short-
ness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over
time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory
airflow limitation (1). Nowadays, inhaled corticosteroids
(ICS) and bronchodilators constitute the mainstay of
asthma treatment. Despite the multifaceted effectiveness
of asthma pharmacotherapy in mild and moderate
forms of the disease, patients with severe asthma often
depend on oral steroids in order to adequately control
their asthma. This group of patients is at increased risk
of exacerbations that may require hospitalisation. They
also have a reduced quality of life not merely due to the
disease itself but also due to the side effects of the
required treatment. According to the recent european
respiratory society/american thoracic society (ERS/ATS)
consensus, severe asthma is defined as asthma that requires
treatment with high-dose ICS plus one more controller
(and/or oral corticosteroids) in order to be controlled or
remains uncontrolled despite the above treatment or
becomes uncontrolled with the reduction of high-dose ICS
or oral corticosteroids. Although this group accounts for
only around 5% of asthmatics, it contributes to approxi-
mately 50% of the economic costs of asthma; therefore, the
development of novel therapies is essential towards optimal
treatment of severe asthma (2, 3). To date, two monoclonal
antibodies, anti-IgE and anti-IL-5, are available but selec-
tion criteria between the two have not yet been established
(4, 5). The aim of the present review is to provide an

 overview of the evidence behind the use of anti-IgE and
anti-IL-5 in severe asthma and possibly to assess the
clinician’s judgment in choosing the right treatment for
the right patient.
Methods
We searched Medline with language restriction (only articles
published in English). The following search terms were used:
‘asthma’, ‘severe asthma’, ‘anti-IL-5’, ‘anti�IgE’ and ‘oma-
lizumab’. The studies selected were then further analysed for
data extraction, including searching the reference lists.
Particular attention was given to studies in severe asthma.
Anti-IgE
Introduction
It is estimated that more than 50% of people with poorly
controlled asthma have allergic immunoglobulin E (IgE)-
mediated asthma and, therefore, may benefit from treat-
ments targeted at IgE. In fact, several biological agents
that interfere either in the synthesis or in the signalling
pathway of IgE have emerged or are under investigation.
Omalizumab, the only biological anti-IgE agent currently
licensed for use in humans, is a recombinant DNA-
derived humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody. It was
originally constructed as a murine antibody selectively
binding to human IgE (6).
Mode of action-effect on inflammation
Omalizumab binds exclusively to circulating IgE in the
blood and interstitial space and consequently promotes
the depletion of circulating IgE. It also inhibits IgE
binding to high-affinity (FcoRI) or low-affinity receptors
(FcoRII) on basophils, mast cells and dendritic cells.
Omalizumab cannot bind to IgE that is already bound to
FcoRI, thus avoiding the FcoRI cross-linking that could
potentially lead to anaphylaxis. Although it does not have
a direct effect on FcoRI levels, downregulation on cells
bearing the receptor actually occurs, mediated through
the depletion of free IgE (7�12). Omalizumab interferes
with the inflammatory cascade by reducing serum IgE
levels and FcoRI receptor expression on key cells. This
results in the inhibition of the release of inflammatory
mediators from mast cells and diminished recruitment
of inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils, into the
airways (13�16).
Apart from the effect on blood and sputum eosinophil
count, a decrease in markers of eosinophilic airway in-
flammation such as serum eosinophil cationic protein,
endothelin-1(ET-1) in exhaled breath condensate and
fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has also been
observed (17, 18). It has been suggested that ET-1 plays
an important role in the development of severe bronchial
hyperreactivity and airway remodelling through enhan-
cing bronchial smooth muscle cells’ proliferation and
subepithelial fibrosis (19). Since omalizumab treatment
affects the inflammatory process in multiple ways, it is
possible that long-term therapy with omalizumab may
have a beneficial effect on airway remodelling either by
inhibiting its progress or by reversing changes already
present. Indeed, omalizumab in murine models and
in vitro experiments was capable of inducing a decrease in
markers of remodelling, such as peribronchial collagen
III/V deposition, hydroxyproline and a-smooth muscle
actin (20). Moreover, omalizumab treatment in patients
with severe persistent asthma was associated with a sig-
nificant reduction in reticular basement membrane (RBM)
thickness, bronchial smooth muscle proteins and other
indices of airway wall thickness compared to standard
care (21�23).
Indications
Omalizumab was approved by the United States (Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)) in 2003 and by the
European Union (European Medicines Agency) in 2005
as an add-on treatment for patients aged �12 years with
severe persistent allergic asthma. Serum total IgE levels
should be in the range 30�700 IU/mL in the USA. In
Europe, serum total IgE ranges are from �30 to B1,500
IU/mL in adults and children over 6 years old. The dose
(mg) and dose frequency of omalizumab are based on the
serum total IgE level (IU/mL) and the patient’s body
weight (kg). Based on a calculation, omalizumab is given
by a subcutaneous injection every 2 or 4 weeks. Initial
treatment response is evaluated at 16 weeks, and treat-
ment is continued in patients showing a response at
that time.
Clinical outcomes
Nowadays, a large body of evidence from randomised
controlled trials and real-life studies is available demon-
strating that anti-IgE treatment reduces exacerbation
rates and improves asthma control in patients with severe
allergic asthma (Table 1).
Evidence from randomised trials is not only confirmed
but also expanded from everyday clinical experience.
Lung function
Omalizumab treatment improves lung function, yet
modestly (26). In the INNOVATE trial, a moderate but
at the same time statistically significant improvement in
forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) and morning
peak expiratory flow (PEF) from baseline was observed
compared to that in placebo group (25). Moreover, in a
real-life setting, a significant improvement of FEV1 was
observed after 4 years of omalizumab treatment (31).
Asthma-related quality of life
Anti-IgE treatment promotes a better disease control,
and this is verified by improvement in quality of life.
Significantly greater improvement in the overall Asthma

 Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) occurred in
omalizumab group, and this remained during both
steroid stable and steroid reduction phases (26). In
another study, an excellent rate on the physician-rated
global evaluation of treatment effectiveness scale was
achieved for 74.6 and 81.6% of patients at 16 weeks and
2 years, respectively. Interestingly, this pattern was main-
tained for patients with ‘off-label’ IgE �700 IU/mL (32).
Safety and tolerability
As the numbers of patients in clinical trials increase and
clinical use has expanded, more data on the safety of the
short- and long-term use of omalizumab are available. An
analysis of over 7,500 patients participating in clinical
trials of omalizumab and of 57,300 patients included in
post-marketing safety follow-up monitoring presents a
more than adequate safety profile. The major adverse
effect recorded is anaphylaxis. The incidence of anaphy-
laxis reported in clinical trials is 0.14% in omalizumab-
treated patients, 0.07% in control patients in clinical
trials and 0.2% with omalizumab treatment from post-
marketing data (33). Adverse effects were generally of
mild-to-moderate severity and of short duration. How-
ever, injection site reactions were more frequent in
the omalizumab group (19.9% vs. 13.2%) (34). Based on
previous observations from clinical trials, concern arose
about the relationship between omalizumab treatment
and malignancies’development. A causal relationship seems
unlikely as the overall incidence of observed malignancy
is rare in omalizumab-treated patients and comparable to
that in the general population (35�37). Recently, con-
cerns about the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular safety
of omalizumab have been raised by the United States FDA,
based on preliminary data from the EXCELS study (38).
A retrospective pharmacovigilance analysis used reports
of arterial thrombotic events submitted to the US FDA’s
Adverse Event Reporting System between 2004 and 2011
to evaluate the association of omalizumab with arterial
thrombotic events. Omalizumab-treated patients reported
a higher than expected number of arterial thrombotic
events (OR 2.75). The majority of the arterial thrombotic
event reports concerned myocardial infarction and stroke.
Despite the large sample sizes, risk estimates from this

 study were not statistically significant. Given the clinical
importance and the impact of such adverse effects on
public health, as well as the fact that the causal relation-
ship between omalizumab and these results has not
yet been investigated, it is crucial to conduct additional
epidemiological studies to test this hypothesis. Mean-
while, FDA recently (9/2014) added information about
this potential risk to the drug label, and it is suggested
that prescribers should cautiously prescribe omalizumab
to asthmatic patients who have risk factors that con-
tribute to arteriothrombotic events (39).
There is a theoretical possibility that treatment with
omalizumab could increase susceptibility to helminth infec-
tion. A non-statistically significant increase in infection
incidence with omalizumab was observed in a 52-week,
randomised, placebo-controlled study in adults and adoles-
cents with allergic asthma or allergic rhinitis at high risk of
intestinal helminth infection (40). It is suggested that patients
at high risk should be warned, especially when travelling to
areas where these infections are endemic.
Recognising the responders
It is important to recognise that not all patients respond
to omalizumab treatment and that therapy cessation in
non-responders will protect them from unreasonable drug
exposure. Several studies have tried to identify clinical or
laboratory characteristics that predict a good therapeutic
response to omalizumab. In a pooled analysis of two
randomised placebo-controlled trials, factors indicative
of more severe asthma (history of emergency treatment,
low FEV1 and high-dose ICS) were predictive of a greater
relative response to add-on omalizumab (24, 41). It is
noteworthy that in one study the baseline total IgE could
be a predictor of response (42).
A potential arises through the observation that specific
cut-off values for Th2 biomarkers (blood eosinophils,
serum periostin and FeNO) could serve as predictors for
omalizumab response (43).
Duration of treatment
To date, guidelines concerning omalizumab’s treatment
duration do not exist. A clinical observation in a group of
18 patients, in which omalizumab treatment was stopped
after 6 years of therapy, reported at 3-year follow-up
improved or stable asthma control combined with lack
of necessity for concomitant medication step-up. The
reactivity of blood basophils to the leading perennial
allergens (cat dander and house dust mites) remained
low, at levels below those before the start of anti-IgE
treatment (44, 45).
Overall, omalizumab therapy is associated with a
distinct therapeutic impact on the full burden of severe
asthma. Exacerbation rate, health care resource utilisa-
tion, symptom frequency and quality of life are positively
affected. Possible effect on airway remodelling opens a
new horizon in asthma therapy although some aspects
still remain unclear regarding patients’ characteristics
who will mostly benefit, optimal duration of treatment
and long-term safety issues.
Anti-IL-5
Introduction
Eosinophils are a key inflammatory cell mediator in the
pathogenesis of asthma (46). Asthma is usually charac-
terised by eosinophilic airway inflammation and structur-
al changes in the airway wall termed ‘remodelling’ (47).
Remodelling may be the consequence of excessive repair
processes following repeated airway injury, and there is
increasing evidence that eosinophils may also be impor-
tant in the pathophysiology of remodelling. In severe
asthma, it has been shown that thickening of the sub-
epithelial basement membrane was associated with in-
creases in bronchial mucosal eosinophils (48). Eosinophil
is the source of several molecules involved in remodel-
ling processes such as TGF-a, TGF-b, VEGF, matrix
metalloperoxidase-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1
and IL-13. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is essential for eosinophil
terminal differentiation, maturation and migration into
the circulation and prolongs the survival of the cell in
tissues (49). Other cytokines and chemokines also play
a role in these processes (50, 51). The importance of IL-5
in asthma pathobiology has been elucidated by studies
on anti-IL-5. These studies provided evidence not only
for the possible role of anti-IL-5 as a therapy for asthma
but also in clarifying the role of airway eosinophils
in its pathobiology. Anti-IL-5 is a humanised mono-
clonal antibody that inhibits the bioactivity of IL-5. It
blocks the binding of IL-5 to the alpha chain of the
IL-5 receptor complex on the eosinophil cell surface.
This inhibits IL-5 signalling and reduces the growth,
differentiation, recruitment, activation and survival of
eosinophils (52, 53).
Early studies
The initial studies on IL-5 provided disappointing results.
Two studies evaluating mepolizumab (monoclonal anti-
body against IL-5) in asthmatics (54, 55) demonstrated
that the antibody effectively prevented the rise in blood
eosinophils but did not affect clinical outcomes. Thus, it
was concluded that IL-5 was important in the mobilisa-
tion and trafficking of eosinophils into the airways, but
questioned the role of eosinophils in asthmatic responses.
However, these conclusions were limited by issues raised
about the study design, such as sample size and metho-
dology (56). A larger study evaluated the efficacy of
mepolizumab at two different doses (250 and 750 mg)
on various asthma outcomes in a group of more than
300 patients with moderate to severe asthma with poor
asthma control. In keeping with the other studies,
the antibody caused an impressive reduction in blood

 eosinophils, but did not demonstrate any significant im-
provement in any of the clinical outcomes measured (57).
In the same study, mepolizumab had a significant effect
in reducing sputum eosinophil numbers, but in the low-
dose treatment group this effect was only partial. The
lack of ability of mepolizumab to completely abolish
airway eosinophils, while having marked effects in redu-
cing blood eosinophils, has previously been documented
(58). These results, therefore, were interpreted as the ‘final
nail in the coffin’ for anti-IL-5 as a treatment strategy for
asthma.
However, there are two very important issues when
evaluating the results of the initial anti-IL-5 studies that
yielded disappointing results on asthma outcomes. The
first is the study population, and the second is the pri-
mary outcome. The ideal study population for the
evaluation of anti-IL-5 treatment would be a population
of asthmatic patients with poorly controlled asthma, with
high numbers of airway eosinophils and who are already
under treatment with ICS.
The choice of the primary outcome in anti-IL-5 studies
that target eosinophils is equally important. The study by
Flood-Page and colleagues (57) showed a trend towards
reducing severe asthma exacerbations with the higher
dose of mepolizumab. However, it should be noted that
the study was not sufficiently powered to show a dif-
ference in exacerbations. Management strategies that aim
at reducing eosinophilic airway inflammation have been
associated with a reduction in the frequency of exacer-
bations (59, 60). Accordingly, these studies suggest that in
a subgroup of patients, eosinophils play an important
role to the pathophysiology of asthmatic exacerbations.
These patients are good candidates for targeted IL-5
therapy. Taking into consideration these two issues, two
studies were designed and published in 2009. In the first
study, asthmatic patients who had sputum eosinophilia
and airway symptoms despite continued treatment with
oral prednisone and high-dose ICS were stratified into
two groups according to their daily dose of prednisolone
(�10 or B10 mg), and then randomised to receive either
mepolizumab (750 mg intravenously, n�9) or placebo
(150 mL 0.9% saline, n�11) as five monthly infusions.
After a 6-week run-in period, prednisolone dose reduc-
tion was attempted according to a predefined protocol.
Mepolizumab reduced the number of blood and sputum
eosinophils and allowed prednisone sparing without the
development of asthma exacerbations. However, the
study was small including only 20 patients and, thus, it
could not be considered clinically directive (61). The
second study included 61 subjects with refractory eosi-
nophilic asthma despite maximum tolerated therapy,
which in many cases included regular use of oral corti-
costeroids and a history of recurrent severe exacerbations.
After a run-in period of 2 weeks prednisolone (1 mg/kg to
a maximum of 40 mg), asthmatics were randomised to
receive 12 infusions of either mepolizumab (750 mg in-
travenously, n�29) or placebo (150 mL 0.9% saline,
n�32) at monthly intervals. Mepolizumab was asso-
ciated with significantly fewer severe exacerbations and a
significant improvement in the AQLQ score. This effect
was accompanied by significantly lower eosinophil counts
in blood and sputum. On the other hand, there were
no significant differences in symptoms, lung function
and airway hyperresponsiveness (62). No serious adverse
events were recorded in either of the two studies. Although
both studies demonstrated a statistically significant reduc-
tion in the rate of asthma exacerbations accompanied by a
significant reduction in blood and sputum eosinophils,
none of them identified any clinically meaningful improve-
ment in symptoms, FEV1 or asthma control. The reduction
of exacerbations by mepolizumab adds support to the
role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of severe asthma
exacerbations in this particular asthmatic population.
A post hoc analysis of the study by Haldar et al. (62)
showed that those asthmatics who responded well to higher
dose oral prednisone tended to do better with mepolizumab
treatment. On the other hand, asthmatic patients with
marked bronchodilator reversibility showed a poorer re-
sponse to mepolizumab. The message than one can derive
from this observation is that mepolizumab works best in
patientswhohaveairflowlimitationandsymptomsasaresult
of corticosteroid-responsive airway inflammation rather
than airway smooth muscle contraction (63).
The new era for anti-IL-5
A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
(DREAM) conducted at 81 centres in 13 countries in-
cluded patients with a history of recurrent severe asthma
exacerbations and signs of eosinophilic inflammation. All
patients received 13 infusions of mepolizumab at 4-week
intervals, and the primary outcome was the rate of clini-
cally significant asthma exacerbations, defined as episodes
of acute asthma requiring treatment with oral corticos-
teroids, admission, or a visit to an emergency department.
Mepolizumab was effective and well tolerated in reducing
the risk of asthma exacerbations. Moreover, mepolizumab
lowered blood and sputum eosinophil counts. However,
a small effect on traditional markers of asthma control
such as FEV1, AQLQ and asthma control questionnaire
(ACQ) scores was noted. This could be partly explained
by the fact that measures of asthma control or quality of
life are not associated with improvements elicited by
reduced eosinophilic airway inflammation. Accordingly,
a dissociation between symptoms and risk of exacerba-
tions is probably evident in some patients with severe
asthma. This study also provided an important clue
regarding the efficacy of mepolizumab; a multivariate
analysis identified that baseline peripheral blood eosino-
phil count and exacerbation frequency in the previous
year were associated with efficacy while more traditional

 markers of asthma such as FEV1 and the acute
bronchodilator response were not. Moreover, IgE con-
centrations and atopic status at baseline were not
associated with a response to mepolizumab, potentially
addressing differences in the mechanism of action and
not excluding complementary effect if omalizumab and
mepolizumab were used in combination (64). In a post
hoc analyse including patients from the MENSA and
the SIRIUS study, it was shown that the response to
mepolizumab in reducing the rate of exacerbations was
the same in those who had or had not been previously
treated with omalizumab (65). Moreover, in the SIRIUS
study, the reductions in the use of oral corticosteroids
(OCS) were comparable regardless of prior omalizumab
use (65). Importantly, adverse events were also compar-
able irrespective of prior omalizumab use (65).
Using a specific hematologic and phenotyping ap-
proach, according to the findings of the DREAM study,
asthmatic patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations
and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation, treated with
high-dose ICS with or without maintenance oral gluco-
corticoids, were selected to receive mepolizumab as either
a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose,
or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The MENSA study
was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-
dummy, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial involving 576
patients. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations.
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or sub-
cutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations
by approximately one half and was associated with im-
provements in quality of life and asthma control. Both
intravenous and subcutaneous doses were effective and
had acceptable side effect profiles (66).
Another study by Bel et al. included asthmatics with a
higher rate of daily oral glucocorticoid use (100% vs. 25%
of the study group in the MENSA study). Many severe
asthmatics require regular treatment with oral corticos-
teroids resulting in serious and often irreversible adverse
effects. In this study, called the Steroid Reduction with
Mepolizumab Study (SIRIUS), the effect of mepolizu-
mab adjunctive subcutaneous therapy in reducing the use
of maintenance oral corticosteroids while maintaining
asthma control in 135 patients with severe eosinophilic
asthma was examined (67). An advantage of this study
was that an optimisation phase was incorporated for the
patients’ oral corticosteroid regimen. In this way, doses
of oral corticosteroids were reduced as much as possible
before starting mepolizumab treatment, thus providing
the assurance that asthmatics genuinely required oral
corticosteroids for control of their asthma. The primary
outcome was the percentage reduction in the corticoster-
oid dose (90 to 100% reduction, 75 to less than 90%
reduction, 50 to less than 75% reduction, more than 0 to
less than 50% reduction, no decrease in oral corticoster-
oid dose, a lack of asthma control during Weeks 20�24 or
withdrawal from treatment). Mepolizumab treatment led
to significantly greater reductions in the maintenance
oral corticosteroid dose than placebo. Moreover, despite
receiving a reduced corticosteroid dose, patients in the
mepolizumab group, as compared with those in the placebo
group, had a relative reduction of 32% in the annualised
rate of exacerbations. Mepolizumab also had a signifi-
cantly beneficial effect on asthma control, and quality
of life, even though patients had a clinically relevant
reduction in the dose of oral corticosteroids.
An unblinded, prospective, observational study was
performed as part of a follow-up, including subjects who
had completed a 12-month administration of mepolizu-
mab in refractory asthma to evaluate the kinetics of
blood and sputum eosinophil counts and assess the
possible relationship between such changes and the
clinical course of the disease. These subjects were observed
for 12 months with assessments every 3 months. Cessation
of mepolizumab was associated with a rise in the blood
eosinophil count soon after stopping therapy and con-
tinuing to baseline over 6 months. The frequency of
severe exacerbations also increased significantly after
stopping mepolizumab. The rise in exacerbations at 3�6
months after stopping mepolizumab was preceded by a
rise in sputum and blood eosinophils, supporting that
these events have different time courses (68).
Discussion
The options provided for treatment Step 5 (GINA) are
anti-IgE and oral corticosteroids. The latter are asso-
ciated with many and sometimes detrimental adverse
effects, and the lower possible dose is recommended
(ideallyB7.5 mg prednisolone/day) (1). Anti-IgE (omali-
zumab) is the recommended treatment for allergic asthma,
and this treatment has been associated with reduction
of exacerbations and improvement of quality of life (26).
New treatments are being tested and are becoming
available for severe asthmatics. The most recent one is
anti-IL-5 which was found to be particularly effective in
severe eosinophilic asthma.
New treatments for severe asthma are mainly mono-
clonal antibodies and constitute an expensive treat-
ment choice. However, their indication applies only to a
minority of asthmatics, those with severe refractory to
treatment disease. These patients comprise the majority
of asthma cost. If the adverse effects of systemic cor-
ticosteroids are taken under consideration, then such
treatments may prove cost-effective mainly because of the
significant reduction of exacerbations leading to fewer
hospital admissions, emergency visits and unscheduled
doctor visits (69).
A reasonable question is whether in a newly encoun-
tered case of severe asthma anti-IgE or anti-IL-5 should
be the first choice. Currently, no studies have been
performed to compare the effect difference of these two

 antibodies on severe asthma. It is conceivable that in non-
allergic eosinophilic asthma, there is no place for anti-IgE
treatment although occasionally omalizumab has been
administered in non-allergic asthmatics based on local
production of IgE (70, 71).
However, in case of allergic eosinophilic asthma, what
might be the first treatment? Mepolizumab almost
depletes eosinophils from peripheral blood and signifi-
cantly reduces them from the airways, and omalizumab
also reduces sputum and tissue eosinophils, as it has
been shown in lung biopsy studies (14, 58). In a pooled
analysis from five randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies including patients with moderate-
to-severe persistent allergic asthma, omalizumab was
associated
with
significantly
reduced
post-treatment
peripheral blood eosinophil counts (13). Moreover, the
greater reductions were observed in those patients with
lower post-treatment free IgE levels. In the EXTRA study
including 850 patients evaluating the peripheral blood
eosinophil count as predictor of treatment effect of
omalizumab, it was found that omalizumab was more
effective in reducing exacerbation frequency in the high
(�260 cells/mL) blood eosinophil group compared with
that in the low blood eosinophil group (43). In the same
study, high FeNO and high periostin were also predictors
of response to omalizumab treatment.
It is likely that some patients with severe asthma have
been treated with anti-IgE, and omalizumab was stopped
after 16 weeks because of an unfavourable effect. In that
case, mepolizumab may be the choice.
In the larger study regarding mepolizumab, the DREAM
study, it was demonstrated that only two variables were
associated with efficacy, and these were baseline periph-
eral blood eosinophil count and exacerbation frequency
in the previous year. The higher these were, the more
effective the treatment was (64). Accordingly, in a case
with very high blood eosinophil counts, mepolizumab
may be the first choice.
IgE has been shown to increase airway remodelling
in asthma through increased airway smooth muscle
proliferation and deposition of proinflammatory col-
lagens and fibronectin. Recent studies have shown that
long treatment with anti-IgE significantly reduced airway
wall
thickness
and
RBM
thickness
within
6
and
12 months, and this effect was independent of eosino-
philic infiltration (21, 22). Moreover, in another study, it
was demonstrated that 48 weeks of treatment with
omalizumab resulted in decrease in airway wall thickness
as assessed by computed tomography (72). Accordingly,
in a severe asthmatic with persistent airway obstruction
possibly associated with airway remodelling, omalizumab
may be the first choice. However, it should be stated that
in a study examining the effect of anti-IL-5 in bronchial
biopsies from 24 atopic asthmatics, it was demonstrated
that apart from the reduction in the numbers and the
percentage of airway eosinophils expressing mRNA for
TGF-b1 (which has been implicated in asthma remodel-
ling), anti-IL-5 was associated with reduction in the
expression of tenascin, lumican and procollagen III in
the bronchial mucosa RBM as well as with reduction of
TGF-b1 concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
(73). These findings indicate that the selective reduction
of eosinophils from the airways may have a reversing
effect on the remodelling process.
On the other hand, one might postulate that a combi-
nation of the two monoclonal antibodies may have a
significantly stronger effect on the control of asthma in
some severe asthmatics. We definitely need studies to
prove it, but in the DREAM study, IgE concentrations
and atopic status at baseline were not associated with the
response to mepolizumab, thus potentially differentiating
this treatment from omalizumab (64).
Moreover, in the study by Magnan et al. (65), it
was demonstrated that patients with severe eosinoph-
ilic asthma who had previously received omalizumab
responded positively to mepolizumab.
The future is linked with the need for direct compar-
isons of anti-IgE and anti-IL-5 against another along
with the search for new biomarkers that will have a better
ability to predict response to treatment either alone or in
combination with the existing ones.
