Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Motor Neuron Disease (MND) [? It is 
60 
synonymous.], is characterized by the degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to 
61 
muscle weakness and eventual paralysis. Until recently, ALS was classified primarily within the 
62 
  
 
3 
neuromuscular domain, although new imaging and neuropathological data have indicated the 
63 
involvement of the non-motor neuraxis in disease pathology. In most patients, the mechanisms 
64 
underlying development of ALS are poorly understood, although a subset of patients have familial 
65 
disease and carry mutations in genes that have various roles in neuronal function. Two disease 
66 
modifying therapies which can slow disease progression, are available for the treatment of ALS, but 
67 
patient management is largely mediated by the use of symptomatic therapies, such as the use of muscle 
68 
relaxants for spasticity and speech therapy for dysarthria.

[H1] Introduction 
72 
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative syndrome that is 
73 
characterized by the degeneration of both upper (that is, neurons that project from the cortex to the  
74 
brain stem and the spinal cord) and lower (that is, neurons that project from the brainstem or spinal 
75 
cord to the muscle) motor neurons leading to motor and extra-motor symptoms (Figure 1). The initial 
76 
presentation of ALS can vary between patients; some present with spinal-onset disease (that is, the 
77 
onset of muscle weakness of the limbs), but others can present with bulbar-onset disease (characterized 
78 
by dysarthria � difficulty with speech � and dysphagia � difficulty swallowing. In most patients, the cause 
79 
of ALS is unknown, although some individuals develop familial forms of the disease, which are 
80 
associated with mutations in genes that have a wide range of functions, including functions in non-
81 
motor cells. In the familial forms of the disease, some of the implicated genes are incompletely 
82 
penetrant, and with rare exceptions, genotype does not necessarily predict phenotype 1. Although the 
83 
primary symptoms of ALS are associated with motor dysfunction (such as muscle weakness, spasticity 
84 
and dysphagia), up to 50% of patients develop cognitive and/or behavioral impairment during the 
85 
course of disease and 13% of patients present with concomitant behavioral variant frontotemporal 
86 
dementia (bv-FTD)2-4. The high prevalence of cognitive and/or behavioural symptoms, coupled with the 
87 
finding of a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 as the major genetic cause of ALS and FTD 5, 6, 
88 
have contributed to the re-characterization of ALS as a neurodegenerative, rather than a neuromuscular 
89 
disorder, and have signposted the direction of research over the coming decade.  
90 
 
91 
 The classification of ALS can vary depending on the criteria used. The traditional definitions of ALS 
92 
subgroups are based on the extent of upper and lower motor neuron involvement, although other 
93 
classification systems include different parameters, such as the site of onset (that is, bulbar or spinal 
94 
  
 
4 
onset of disease), the level of certainty of diagnosis according to the revised El Escorial Criteria and 
95 
heritability (sporadic or familial disease)7. To date, none of these classification systems have 
96 
incorporated the cognitive or behavioural symptoms and within each classification system a range of 
97 
sub-phenotypes and clinical trajectories can be demonstrated.  
98 
 
99 
This Primer will review the aspects of ALS that contribute to disease heterogeneity, and will look to the 
100 
future of new therapeutic trials that incorporate recent advances in our understanding of this disease 
101 
spectrum. For new therapies, the challenge is to define mechanisms of disease amenable to drug 
102 
targeting, and to define sub-cohorts of patients that are likely to respond to these new therapeutic 
103 
agents.

106 
[H1] Epidemiology 
107 
 
108 
[H2] Descriptive epidemiology  
109 
The majority of population based epidemiological studies for ALS have come from high quality European  
110 
patient Registers 8. These European population based Registers have been combined to form the 
111 
European ALS Epidemiology Consortium (EURALS), which has provided data comparing the incidence of 
112 
ALS between European countries 9. In Europe, the incidence ranges from 2-3 cases per 100,000 
113 
individuals. Defined geographical areas are ideally suited to estimate the incidence and prevalence, and 
114 
to support more-detailed studies of risk, clinical trajectory, outcome and utilization of services for ALS8. 
115 
As ALS is a rare disease, a population-based approach with multiple sources of ascertainment is the best 
116 
way to describe the entire phenotypic spectrum 10 as population-based registers provide more complete 
117 
information about the disease than datasets from specialist clinics, which are often biased in favour of 
118 
younger patients and those with less severe disease [?OK] 10. Similarly, clinical trial cohorts such as those 
119 
collected within the US-based pooled resource open-access ALS clinical trials database (?OK ] ProACT) 
120 
dataset also select for patients with ALS who have better prognosis; survival within these cohorts is ~12 
121 
months longer than that of true population-based cohorts.  
122 
 [OK] [OK] Contrary to earlier assumptions, the incidence of ALS has been shown to differ based on 
123 
ancestral origin; studies in populations of European origin [] have shown a crude incidence of >3 cases 
124 
per 100,000 individuals 11, 12, but  incidence rates are lower in East Asia (around 0.8 per 100,00) and 
125 
  
 
5 
South Asia (0.7 per 100,000).   In some regions (such as Guam and the Kii peninsula of Japan) the 
126 
reported incidence was very high, but dropped substantially over the past 30 years for reasons that 
127 
remain unclear. In areas where different ancestral populations live in close proximity (as in Northern 
128 
America), the incidence rates of ALS in indigenous populations is particularly low (0.63 cases per 100,000 
129 
individuals)13, whereas reported incidences in regions of relatively homogeneous populations (such as 
130 
Ireland, Scotland and the Faroe Islands)  are high (2.6 cases per 100, 000 individuals) 9, 14. 
131 
 
132 
In addition, variations in the phenotype and natural history of ALS have been reported in different 
133 
ancestral populations; indeed reported survival of patients with ALS is much shorter in Europe (24 
134 
months) than in Central Asia (48 months) 15. [OK] In addition, admixed populations (that is, populations 
135 
of mixed ancestry OK] ) might have lower mortality rates of ALS.  In a population-based study in Cuba, 
136 
ALS mortality rate was 0.55 per 100,000 individuals in a mixed population,[ OK ]  but was about 0.9 per 
137 
100,000 individuals [Au:OK?OK] in white or black individuals 16, confirming the importance of ancestral 
138 
origin in disease risk. [ok ] In Europe, most men have spinal onset disease, and women have increased 
139 
propensity for bulbar onset disease 9. The percentage of individuals with bulbar onset disease is much 
140 
lower in Asia compared with Europe, but a North to South gradient has been described in Europe, with 
141 
higher percentage of individuals with spinal onset disease in Southern Europe 9. Based on available data, 
142 
the age of diagnosis and first symptoms is higher in Europe compared to Asia and South America. [OK ] 
143 
In Europe, the age of onset peaks at  65 9. []  The main limitation of global ALS epidemiology is that 
144 
almost 80% of studies have been conducted in Europe and the US, and mainly comprise patient cohorts 
145 
of Northern European ancestry. International consortia collecting data in areas with mixed populations 
146 
and in different continents will be required to fully elucidate the range of clinical presentations, and to 
147 
understand the roles of ancestry, genetics and environmental exposures in ALS causation.

151 
[H3] Genetics. ALS is considered a complex genetic disorder with a Mendelian pattern of inheritance in a 
152 
proportion of cases, but no discernible family history in the rest. Mathematical models developed using 
153 
population-based registers have suggested that individuals with ALS are likely to carry a number of �at 
154 
risk� variants that interact with environmental factors through a series of at least 6 notional steps 
155 
leading to disease manifestation. One of these steps is thought to be the genetic risk (from birth), but 
156 
the interplay of environmental factors that lead to the remaining steps have yet to be defined. In 
157 
  
 
6 
transgenic mice, the genetic background can alter the phenotypic presentation of ALS [OK ?] 17, 18, 
158 
suggesting that human disease phenotypes could also have a genetic  basis, and that genomic and

���������� ���������������� ����� ������ the clustering of different phenotypic manifestations into 
160 
discrete underlying causes that are amenable to therapeutic intervention.  
161 
 
162 
Large combined genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of apparently sporadic ALS suggest that the 
163 
genetic architecture is based primarily on rare variants, in contrast to other diseases, such as 
164 
schizophrenia, which are associated with large numbers of common variants. GWAS in ALS are also 
165 
complicated as the rare variants that confer risk might be specific to individuals, families and ancestral 
166 
populations 19, rendering GWAS less suited for study of ALS genetics than is schizophrenia. Initiatives 
167 
such as the Project MinE Consortium (www.projectmine.com), which aims to undertake whole genome 
168 
sequencing of >16,000 patients with ALS and 6,000 control individuals, are likely to provide greater 
169 
clarity of the genetic architecture of ALS.  
170 
 
171 
Of the known genes of major effect for the development of ALS (Table 1 [  OK), our current knowledge 
172 
comes primarily from the study of ancestral European (Europe, USA, Canada and Australia) and East 
173 
Asian populations; within these populations,  OKthe dichotomization of ALS into �familial� and �sporadic� 
174 
subtypes is an over-simplification. Although at least 30 genes are known to confer a major risk for ALS, 
175 
evidence suggests a role of oligogenic inheritance (in which a phenotypic trait is determined by more 
176 
than one gene? OK ] ) and of genetic pleiotropy (in which a single gene  [OK ] has multiple phenotypic 
177 
manifestations). Within populations of European extraction, up to 20% of people with ALS have a family 
178 
history of either ALS or FTD (Familial ALS) , and of these  4 genes account for up to 70% of all cases of 
179 
familial ALS , namely C9orf72, TARDBP (also known as TDP43), SOD1 and FUS [?OK] 20. However, even in 
180 
the case of these known Mendelian inherited genes, familial forms of ALS are often characterized by 
181 
lower than 50% penetrance [and genetic pleiotropy, with evidence of oligogenic and polygenic 
182 
inheritance in individuals with apparently sporadic disease 21, 22.

184 
[H3] Environmental and lifestyle factors. OK ]. Epidemiological case control studies have sought to 
185 
determine the environmental causes of ALS. Early epidemiological studies from regions with a high 
186 
incidence of ALS and dementia such as Guam and the Kii peninsula of Japan suggested a role for 
187 
neurotoxins [Would prefer to retain neurotoxins ] contained within cycad seeds, including �-
188 
methylamino-L-alanine OK] . Although the role of  �-methylamino-L-alanine23 has not been 
189 
  
 
7 
substantiated, a possible role for related cyanotoxins has been proposed, and exposure to water 
190 
harbouring cyanobacterial blooms has been suggested to contribute to risk of ALS in susceptible 
191 
individuals 24.  
192 
 
193 
ALS has been reported at a higher frequency among groups of athletes compared to the general 
194 
population although whether physical activity is a risk factor for ALS, or a marker of underlying athletic 
195 
prowess is unclear. Evidence from a UK study suggests that individuals with ALS had higher rates of pre-
196 
morbid [Pre-Morbid is ok � standard use PJS I AGREE] physical activity, but two other European studies 
197 
suggested either no effect, or a protective effect 22-24. Reasons for this discrepancy [might relate to study 
198 
design and true population-based differences. However, because ALS is a rare disease, smaller case 
199 
control studies are often underpowered and are subject to both bias and error in interpretation. To 
200 
address these problems in study design, a very large case control study  OK has been completed as part 
201 
of the EuroMOTOR project (www.euromotorproject.eu), which has collected >1,500 population-based 
202 
incident cases and 3,000 matched controls across 3 countries. Analysis is ongoing, although preliminary 
203 
data suggest that exposure to smoking might increase the risk of developing ALS, but type 2 diabetes 
204 
mellitus, high levels of circulating lipids and exposure to [EXPOSURE is more accurate female

[H2] Histopathology [?OK ]  
210 
Although the fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ALS are not well understood, the 
211 
neuropathological hallmark of disease is the aggregation and accumulation of ubiquitinated 
212 
proteinaceous inclusions in motor neurons [?YES ] . Protein inclusions occur in other neurodegenerative 
213 
disorders (such as amyloid plaques in Alzheimer Disease and synuclein-containing Lewy Bodies in 
214 
Parkinson Disease OK ]. The biological processes leading to formation of these inclusions OK] has been 
215 
the subject of intensive research, but is poorly understood 4.  
216 
In most subtypes of ALS the tar DNA-binding protein 43 OK ] (TDP-43) is the major constituent of these 
217 
inclusions, although mutations in TARDBP are a rare cause of ALS 27, 28 OK r] Indeed, approximately 97% 
218 
of patients with ALS have features of a TDP-43 proteinopathy, with depletion of TDP-43 in the nucleus, 
219 
but the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates with skein-like or compact morphology in residual motor

221

might be seen outside the motor system in patients with �ALS ���������� ���� C�ORF72 mutations OK ]

[H2] Overview of pathophysiology OK 
245 
Progress has been made in the identification of the genetic causes of ALS21, 22 and models in rat, mouse, 
246 
zebrafish, flies, worms and yeast have been developed to study the mechanisms by which gene 
247 
mutations cause motor neuron degeneration and to model particular biological processes thought to be 
248 
important in disease pathobiology. All of these models have limitations and none fully recapitulates 
249 
human disease, which is partly because most models are based on gene overexpression (with multiple 
250 
copies of the human variant inserted into the transgenic model) and because the human neuro-axis

OK ] can contribute to our understanding of the cell biology underlying neurodegeneration and can 
253 
open new avenues towards targeted drug development. In reality, the cellular disruption ?OK ] in ALS is 
254 
likely the result of many different interacting mechanisms that culminate in larger network disruption, 
255 
and the separation of different mechanisms is somewhat artificial. [OK ] This is exemplified by the 
256

258 
pathobiology of human disease cannot be fully ascertained, it would be erroneous to assume that  all of 
259 
these factors are involved in all cases of ALS, as human disease is heterogeneous. Notwithstanding, each 
260 
of the thematic areas should be considered in detail, as they represent our current knowledge base of 
261 
the pathophysiology of ALS, and are the drivers of current and future therapeutic initiatives (Figure 3).

265 
Mutations in some genes OK ] lead to the translation of proteins that are misfolded, have an abnormal 
266 
cellular localization or are aberrantly formed, and that can directly or indirectly impair the proteasome 
267 
or autophagy machinery of the cell, leading to impaired cellular protein turnover. Indeed, genes 
268 
associated with familial ALS encode proteins that can [OK ] promote dysfunction of the ubiquitin-
269 
proteasome system. For example, mutant SOD1 is associated with reduced expression of ubiquitin-
270 
proteasome system components 33, valosin-containing protein (VCP) and ubiquilin-2 are involved in 
271 
substrate delivery to the proteasome, and this function is disrupted in the presence of ALS-associated 
272 
mutations [n SENTENCE IS OK AS IT STANDS ] 34-36. In addition, dysregulation of chaperone proteins has 
273 
been identified in ALS associated with SOD1 and TARDBP mutations 37-40 . Mutations in VAPB (encoding 
274 
vesicle-associated membrane protein associated protein B [Au OK:] ) can cause defective activation of

[H2] Excitotoxicity 
399 
Motor neurons are very sensitive to toxicity induced by calcium entry following excessive glutamate 
400 
stimulation as they have a lower calcium buffering capacity than other neuronal subtypes and �-amino-
401 
3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors that are more calcium permeable (as 
402 
they contain less of the GluR2 subunit) 106. In addition, excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), an 
403 
astroglial [protein that is the main synaptic glutamate re-uptake transporter, is impaired in ALS, which is 
404 
likely to result in synaptic glutamate abundance and motor neuron toxicity. The loss of EAAT2 has been  
405 
observed in both rodent models and patients with  familial or sporadic ALS.  Excitotoxicity is thought to 
406 
be a mechanism common to all forms of ALS, although the evidence for this remains indirect. One 
407 
argument is that riluzole, which can attenuate disease progression and is an approved drug for 
408 
neuroprotection in ALS, can inhibit glutamate release 107, 108. However, whether this underlies the 
409 
therapeutic effect of riluzole remains unclear.

[H2] Oligodendrocyte degeneration  
412 
Oligodendrocyte degeneration has been observed in ALS. In the healthy CNS, oligodendrocytes are 
413 
replaced by the proliferation [Au: and presumably differentiation NOT FULLY DIFFERENTIATED, so BEST 
414 
TO LEAT TEXT AS IS ?] of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which are abundantly present 109, 110 . At least 
415 
in animal models of ALS, and for reasons that are now clear [Au: please expand on this in 1-2 sentences; 
416 
what causes this failure to differentiate?] CAUSES ARE NOT KNOWN  , oligodendrocyte precursor cells 
417 
�A�� I��� ��������� ��������� ����� ����� OK��OK  fail to go through the final stages of differentiation. 
418 
Oligodendrocytes provide vital metabolic support to axons through the shuttling of lactate through 
419 
monocarboxylate transporter 2 111, 112, and accordingly, dysfunction of oligodendrocytes contributes to 
420 
the motor axonal failure [YES ] in ALS. Restoring oligodendrocytic function by transgenically deleting 
421 
mutant SOD1 from these cells significantly slows disease progression and prolongs their life span 113. In 
422 
patients with ALS, abnormalities in oligodendrocytes can occur, but whether these changes contribute 
423 
to the disease remains to be demonstrated.  
424 
 
425 
[H2] Neuroinflammation  
426 
 [OK Neuroinflammation can be observed in imaging studies in patients with ALS, human postmortem 
427 
samples and rodent models of ALS 114, 115. [Au: cite fewer refs here? Refs removed]. Astrocytes and 
428 
microglial cells release a number of hazardous and possibly neuroprotective factors. Deleting mutant 
429 
Sod1 OK ] from these cells in a mouse model increases survival and slows disease progression 116, 
430 
indicating that inflammation is an important factor for amplifying neuronal injury and disease 
431 
progression in ALS. [OK Microglia have dual activation phenotypes, which can be neuroprotective (the 
432 
M2  phenotype) or toxic (also known as classically activated, or M1 phenotype); evidence from SOD1- 
433 
transgenic mice suggests the phenotype of microglia evolves with disease progression, from a 
434 
neuroprotective phenotype at disease onset to a neurotoxic phenotype, with an altered cytokine release 
435 
profile, at end-stage disease 117 OK  In addition, evidence highlights complex signalling between CNS 
436 
resident immune cells and peripheral cells, including monocytes and T-lymphocytes. 
437 
[H2] Mitochondrial dysfunction  
438 
Mitochondrial function is impaired in ALS and changes in mitochondrial morphology have been shown in 
439 
some patients, and in the SOD1 mouse model 118, 119. In the SOD1 model, vacuoles containing protein 
440 
aggregates containing mutant SOD1 can be observed in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space, 
441 
leading to impairment of protein import 120. In addition, oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins 
442 
leads to defects in respiratory chain function in patients with ALS and in SOD1 mouse models 121, and  
443 
  
 
15 
various  experimental models of ALS have defects in axonal transport of mitochondria, which could 
444 
contribute to the axonopathy at the neuromuscular junction 122, 123.  
445 
 
446 
Many of the functions disrupted in ALS are regulated by signalling between the endoplasmic reticulum 
447 
and mitochondria, underpinned by tight junction associations mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum 
448 
protein VAPB and the outer mitochondrial protein regulator of microtubule dynamics protein 124. These 
449 
associations are perturbed by TARDBP and FUS mutations125, 126. TDP-43 preferentially binds to mRNAs 
450 
encoding respiratory chain complex 1 subunits and causes complex 1 disassembly 127 and accumulates in 
451 
the mitochondria of patients with ALS and mutations in TARDBP increase the mitochondrial localization 
452 
of TDP-43. Suppression of TDP-43 localization to mitochondria improves mitochondrial dysfunction and 
453 
reduces neuronal loss in mTDP-43 cell based models. In C9orf72-related ALS models, the dipeptide 
454 
repeat protein poly(GR) appears to compromise mitochondrial function and causes oxidative stress and 
455 
DNA damage 128. CHCHD10 mutations, which are associated with familial ALS, can promote the loss of 
456 
mitochondrial cristae junctions, impair mitochondrial genome maintenance and interfere with apoptosis 
457 
by preventing of cytochrome-C release 129.  
458 
 
459 
[H2] Final common pathway 
460 
The main mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of ALS is probably dependent on the initial cause, 
461 
although multiple mechanisms appear to explain the toxicity of one mutation and these mechanisms are 
462 
likely highly interlinked. This is clearly the case for SOD1 mutations. In the case of C9orf72 repeat 
463 
expansions, multiple factors likely contribute to neuronal injury including toxic gains-of-function related 
464 
to RNA foci and the presence of dipeptide repeat proteins, but loss of the normal function of the 
465 
C9orf72 protein might also have a role.  
466 
 
467 
Whatever the mechanisms of ALS, the end result is that the motor neuron cannot maintain its axonal 
468 
projections, leading to axonal retraction and denervation of the target cell. For lower motor neurons, 
469 
this results in denervation of the muscle, but for upper motor neurons results in the loss of proper 
470 
control of lower motor neurons, hypertonicity and  weakness .. In addition, a loss of important neural 
471 
networks within motor and extra-motor domains is also apparent 130. []OK  As many of the proteins 
472 
encoded by genes that are implicated in ALS are ubiquitously expressed (Table 1), it is unclear why 
473 
motor neurons are the most susceptible to the hazardous effects of these mutations. The large size of 
474 
motor neurons, and in particular the need to maintain their long axonal projections, could make these 
475 
  
 
16 
cells more sensitive to metabolic abnormalities than others, but other neuronal subtypes, such as 
476 
sensory neurons, have even larger axonal projections.  Other factors that have been suggested to have a 
477 
role are the high expression of EphA4 and matrix metalloprotein 9  and the low expression of 
478 
osteopontin and insulin-like growth factor 2  by motor neurons, which might limit axonal sprouting and 
479 
repair. Of particular interest is that within the motor neuron pool, neurons that establish the fast 
480 
fatiguable motor units die first in ALS 131, 132 , but how this relates to the other vulnerability factors needs 
481 
to be clarified.

[H1] Diagnosis, screening and prevention 
484 
 
485 
[H2] Clinical presentations  
486 
 [OK The clinical hallmark of ALS is the involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons (Figure 1). 
487 
Patients can present with symptoms of an upper motor neuron predominant onset (that is, spasticity 
488 
and [Au: muscle] weakness) in whom lower motor neuron involvement only becomes evident at later 
489 
stages of disease. 7, 133-136 [Au: cite fewer refs here? Keep these refs if possible] . Conversely, patients 
490 
can present with symptoms of lower motor neuron dysfunction, which includes fasciculations, cramps 
491 
and muscle wasting. Approximately one third of patients with ALS present with bulbar-onset disease, 
492 
which is characterized by progressive dysarthria, followed by difficulty swallowing and often with 
493 
associated emotional lability. Limb onset disease accounts for 60% of cases, is usually asymmetrical in 
494 
presentation and can first develop in the upper or lower limb. [Up to 5% of patients present with 
495 
respiratory problems and are often seen first in cardiology and pulmonology clinics prior to their referral 
496 
to neurology clinics 137. In these cases, patients can also present with unexplained weight loss. Evidence 
497 
suggests that some patients with ALS are hypermetabolic; 138 although the pathophysiology 
498 
underpinning this is not well understood.  Cardiovascular risk factors (such as hyperlipidemia or obesity) 
499 
might attenuate risk 138, but do not alter clinical outcome 139 . Patients can present with a pure motor 
500 
phenotype of ALS, and have normal cognition and behaviour, but some patients can present with a 
501 
purely cognitive or behavioural phenotype consistent with frontotemporal dementia(FTD) ), or a mixed 
502 
phenotype with minor changes in executive impairment that progress over time. Frontotemporal 
503 
dementia is part of the presenting features of 13% of incident cases 2-4 and approximately 30% of all 
504 
incident patients have some evidence of executive dysfunction at the time of first presentation 3, 140. 
505 
Depending on the population and the extent of cognitive testing performed, most studies have 
506 
  
 
17 
suggested that up to 50% of patients can remain cognitively normal throughout the course of the 
507 
disease 3 Behavioural changes are common in patients with ALS, with apathy as the most prevalent 
508 
symptom. Detailed examination of behavioural changes in patients with ALS, using a disease specific 
509 
behavioural scale (that is, the Beaumont Behavioural Index) suggests that up to 40% of incident cases 
510 
have new behavioural changes that can be clustered into at least 5 different groups which roughly map 
511 
to known neuroanatomical networks and pathways 141. Substantial autonomic impairment (such as 
512 
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and bladder dysfunction) does not occur in the majority of patients with 
513 
ALS.  
514 
 
515 
[H2] Diagnostic criteria  
516 
No definitive test for the diagnosis of ALS is available, and diagnosis is a process of clinical investigation 
517 
to exclude other possible causes of the presenting symptoms, combined with evidence of disease 
518 
progression. However, the growing understanding of the extra-motor features of ALS, the presence of 
519 
phenotypic overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases and the identification of genetic and 
520 
pathological subtypes of ALS can confound accurate and timely diagnosis 7.  
521 
 
522 
Diagnosing ALS is based on the El Escorial criteria (Box 2) 142. Diagnosis according to these criteria 
523 
requires a history of progressive weakness spreading within a region or to other regions (such as bulbar 
524 
regions (speech and swallowing), cervical regions (upper limbs), thoracic regions (chest wall and 
525 
abdominal muscles) or lumbar regions (lower limbs), with evidence of lower motor neuron (through the 
526 
presence of specific symptoms or evidence of denervation on electromyography) and upper motor 
527 
neuron (through the presence of specific symptoms and brisk deep tendon reflexes) involvement  In the 
528 
original criteria, diagnostic certainty ranged from Suspected ALS, (although this is no longer included in 
529 
the revised criteria), to Definite ALS (in which three body regions with mixed upper and lower motor 
530 
neuron findings were observed), which relates to the burden of disease. Neurophysiological findings 
531 
have been classified using the Awaji Criteria, which can enhance diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity 143. 
532 
Variants of the El Escorial criteria are used in research settings and for the purposes of clinical trial 
533 
enrolment, but these criteria  should not be routinely used in clinical practice for routine patient 
534 
����������� �� ��������� AL“� ��������� �� ��� �������� �� ������ ������ AL“ clinically 144, 145. Genetic 
535 
testing can also be included in patients with a strong family history of ALS 146 and clinical evidence of 
536 
disease, although this is not uniformly applied across centres 147.  
537 
 
538 
  
 
18 
[H2] Cognitive and behavioural deficits  
539 
Standard diagnostic and stratification parameters for ALS do not yet include cognitive or behavioural 
540 
status, which is altered in up to 50% of cases (depending on the extent of cognitive and behavioural 
541 
assessment  2-4. Various screening tools have been designed to identify patients with ALS and cognitive 
542 
and behavioural changes in the clinic, such as the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen 
543 
(ECAS), which is validated in several languages and is widely used, as it has a high degree of sensitivity 
544 
with lower degrees of specificity 148. Individuals with abnormal ECAS scores (after adjustment to 
545 
population-based and educational norms) should be referred for a full neuropsychological evaluation 149. 
546 
The detection of cognitive and behavioural changes is important for patients with ALS and their 
547 
caregivers, as executive impairment is associated with a more-rapid disease trajectory and behavioural 
548 
changes are associated with higher caregiver burden 150.  
549 
 
550 
[H2] Biomarkers  
551 
As ALS is a clinical syndrome with a heterogeneous phenotypic manifestation [and clinical course, 
552 
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are urgently required for the purposes of stratification. Levels of 
553 
neurofilament light chain (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain in the cerebrospinal fluid 
554 
(CSF) can differentiate patients with  ALS from those with mimics including cervical myelopathy, 
555 
multifocal motor neuropathy and inclusion body myositis, with moderate sensitivity and specificity [Au: 
556 
could you quote some values ����� ���������� �� ����� �� ���������� �����, and levels have a 
557 
moderate correlation with disease progression [Au: how do they correlate? Do levels increase with 
558 
progression?] 151-153. However, CSF neurofilament levels are not integrated into standard clinical 
559 
practice. Levels of NfL in serum are sensitive and specific for separating patients with ALS from healthy 
560 
controls, but data on comparison with ALS mimics are not  available.  
561 
 
562 
MRI studies of patients with ALS have shown corticospinal tract degeneration, with extensive 
563 
involvement within the frontal and temporal regions and basal ganglia, compared with controls  
564 
Evidence suggests that selective network vulnerability of structural and functional �connectomes� could 
565 
drive the clinical manifestations of ALS, such as vulnerability of the corticospinal, orbitofrontal, 
566 
orbitotemporal and frontostriatal circuits 154-156. The presence of network disruption is also supported by 
567 
findings using spectral electroencephalogram 130, and that patients with different degrees of cognitive 
568 
impairment show significantly different patterns of frontal lobe metabolic impairment on 18F 
569 
fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging 157. However, neither imaging nor spectral electroencephalogram can 
570 
  
 
19 
provide individualised data that can be used as a reliable biomarker of upper motor neuron dysfunction 
571 
and of cognitive impairment in patients with ALS.  
572 
 
573 
[H2] Differential diagnosis  
574 
The differential diagnosis in patients with pure  bulbar pure upper motor neuron or pure lower motor 
575 
neuron presentations includes ALS variants, treatable ALS mimics and disorders with a more benign 
576 
prognosis 134, 158. Other forms of motor neuron disease include progressive muscular atrophy (that is, the 
577 
exclusive degeneration of lower motor neurons) and primary lateral sclerosis (that is, the exclusive 
578 
degeneration of upper motor neurons). Some patients with progressive muscular atrophy have 
579 
mutations in genes associated with ALS159. Similarly, patients with primary lateral sclerosis may have a 
580 
family member with ALS  and most autopsies of patients with primary lateral sclerosis show subtle signs 
581 
of ALS pathology in the lower motor neurons within the brain stem and  spinal cord 135, 158.  
582 
 
583 
Several conditions have similar initial clinical features as ALS and should be considered in the differential 
584 
diagnosis 145, including cervical myelopathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, Lambert 
585 
Eaton myasthenic syndrome and inclusion body myositis. Features that should alert the clinician to a 
586 
possible mimic syndrome include presentation with of symmetrical findings; prominent extensor plantar 
587 
responses (which should raise suspicion of a cervical myelopathy)  and the presence of sensory findings. 
588 
Although sensory symptoms are common in ALS, clinical evidence of sensory loss is atypical and should 
589 
trigger further investigations. In addition, the presence of substantial weakness in the absence of 
590 
wasting � which is common in multifocal motor neuropathy and myasthenia gravis � and the presence 
591 
of disproportionate involvement of quadriceps � which is common in inclusion body myositis � may 
592 
indicate the presence of an ALS mimic syndrome 160. As ALS is a progressive disease, failure of the 
593 
condition to progress over months should also trigger a re-investigation 161. 
594 
 
595 
[H2] Staging and prognosis [  
596 
Several different staging systems for ALS have been described (Figure 4) 162-165, including ��� K����� 
597 
system, which is based on the number of affected regions of the body, and the Milano-Torino system 
598 
(MITOS), which is based on a clinical scale The prognosis of ALS is highly variable and prognostic 
599 
algorithms have been generated from population-based and clinical trial-based datasets 166, 167. Negative 
600 
prognostic indicators include bulbar or respiratory onset disease, the presence of executive impairment 
601 
or frontotemporal dementia and weight loss.  Several biochemical markers of prognosis have been 
602 
  
 
20 
reported including serum urate, serum creatinine, serum chloride, and increased serum and CSF 
603 
neurofilament levels 153, 168-170 [Au: please cite fewer refs here. Keep if possible?]  Declining respiratory 
604 
function, measured by slow vital capacity, forced vital capacity and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure also 
605 
correlate with short survival 166, 167, 171, 172. [Au: please limit the number of references here to 1-2. Keep 
606 
if possible?]  
607 
 
608 
[H2] Clinical genetics and predictive testing  
609 
Consensus guidelines recommend genetic testing of probands with ALS who have a first or second 
610 
degree relative with ALS and/or frontotemporal dementia 19, 173. As the genetic risk for ALS depends on 
611 
ancestral origin, the genetic testing should be contextualized; for example, C9orf72 variants are rare in 
612 
Asia, whereas mutations in OPTN are more common in Asian than in European populations. Although 
613 
the potential benefits of genetic testing for patients are clear and could improve knowledge about their 
614 
disease, family planning and their possible inclusion in clinical trials, individuals also have a right not to 
615 
know their genetic status. Pre-symptomatic testing of family members of patients with ALS remains 
616 
controversial. Guidelines for genetic testing in research settings have been published 174, but most 
617 
centres do not advocate routine testing outside of specialist centres 147. 
618 
 [H1] Management 
619 
 
620 
ALS management is best achieved by a multidisciplinary approach to care, comprising a clinical team 
621 
with different specialities, including neurologists, psychologists, nutritionists, pulmonologists, physical 
622 
therapists, speech therapists and specialized nurses175, 176. Multidisciplinary care increases survival 177-179, 
623 
reduces the number of hospital admissions and shortens hospital stays 178 and increases quality of life of 
624 
patients with ALS 180. This is likely related to the optimization of pharmacological and non-
625 
pharmacological interventions   and enhanced adherence to treatment guidelines.  
626 
 
627 
[H2] Disease-modifying therapies  
628 
Although > 50 drugs with different mechanisms of action have been studied for the treatment of ALS, 
629 
only 2 compounds (riluzole and edaravone have come to market. The negative results of these trials 
630 
might include clinical and pathogenetic heterogeneity in disease, and faults in trial design 181.  
631 
Riluzole was the first FDA approved treatment for ALS, and, although the mechanism of action is poorly 
632 
understood, is speculated to reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission, by blocking voltage-gated sodium 
633 
  
 
21 
channels on presynaptic neurons. . In the original trial, Riluzole,  increased 18-month survival of patients 
634 
by 3 months compared with placebo , but had no significant effect on muscle strength 182. Riluzole is a 
635 
relatively safe drug, although the most common adverse effects are an increase in liver enzymes and 
636 
asthenia (that is, a lack of energy) and some cases of fatal hepatic failure and pancreatitis have been 
637 
reported. In addition to the traditional tablet form of the drug, an oral suspension has been produced 
638 
and marketed in some countries for patients who are unable to swallow solid forms of the drug, owing 
639 
to severe dysphagia 183. Edaravone, which is thought to act as an anti-oxidant agent  has a beneficial 
640 
effect on progression  in a highly selected cohort of patients with early onset and rapidly  progressive 
641 
disease  184, and accordingly, has been licensed by the US FDA but not by the European Medicines 
642 
Agency.   Whether edaravone should be provided to all patients of ALS regardless of clinical 
643 
presentation is a matter of debate 185  
644 
 
645 
 [H2] Symptomatic treatments  
646 
Other symptoms of ALS can be treated with pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. 
647 
Nuedexta may improve bulbar function 186 and is available in the US but not in Europe. However, most 
648 
of these therapies  for the symptoms of ALS have not been tested in randomized controlled trials and 
649 
are based on management  of other diseases.  
650 
 
651 
 [H3] Spasticity. Spasticity is present in most patients with ALS, but only a small proportion need 
652 
treatment. The most commonly used drugs are baclofen and tizanidine (both of which are muscle 
653 
relaxants) although no randomized controlled trials in patients with ALS have been conducted. When 
654 
patients have severe, disabling spasticity, baclofen can be administered through an intrathecal pump. . 
655 
Cannabinoids have been approved  for the treatment of spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis and 
656 
are also used off-label or as a self-prescribed medication in patients with ALS187.  
657 
 
658 
[H3] Sialorrhoea. Sialorrhoea (that is hypersalivation), causing drooling and the pooling of saliva within 
659 
the oral cavity is one of the most disturbing symptoms in patients with ALS, and is more commonly 
660 
observed in patients with bulbar-onset disease and during late-stages. Sialorrhoea can be treated [with 
661 
anticholinergic drugs, such as scopolamine, atropine, hyoscine, amitriptyline and glycopyrrolate. 
662 
Adverse effects associated with the use of anti-cholinergics include blurred vision, mouth dryness and 
663 
constipation, and these drugs are contraindicated in patients with heart conduction disturbances and 
664 
prostatic hypertrophy. In patients in whom pharmacological treatments are ineffective or are not 
665 
  
 
22 
indicated, botulinum toxin A or B injections into the salivary glands can used to treat sialorrhoea188, 189. 
666 
Salivary gland irradiation has been also proposed 190.  
667 
 
668 
[H3] Pain. Pain is reported in 15�85% of patients with ALS, depending on the duration of the disease  
669 
and the setting of the study, and is more frequently of nociceptive than of neuropathic origin. 191 
670 
Depending of the type of pain, pharmacological treatments include gabapentin, pregabalin and tricyclic 
671 
antidepressants (for neuropathic pain), and NSAIDs, opioids and cannabis for nociceptive pain), but no 
672 
randomized controlled trials evaluating treatment of pain in patients with ALS are available. Nociceptive 
673 
pain can be also treated with intra-joint injections of lidocaine or steroids, and physical therapy, 
674 
including assistive range-of-motion exercises.  
675 
 
676 
[H3] Muscle cramps. Muscle cramps are the main cause of pain in about one-quarter of patients with 
677 
ALS (mainly patients with the spinal onset disease) and are caused by the instability of motor units 192. 
678 
Commonly used treatments for muscle cramps include quinine sulphate, levetiracetam and mexiletine. 
679 
Indeed, mexiletine has been shown to induce a significant dose-dependent reduction in muscle cramps  
680 
in a phase 2 randomized controlled trial in patients with ALS 193. Of note, the FDA has advised against the 
681 
use of quinine sulphate for the treatment of cramps because it can cause cardiac arrhythmias, 
682 
bradycardia and prolongation of Q-T interval.  
683 
 
684 
[H3] Dysphagia 
685 
Dysphagia is reported by about 60% of patients with spinal onset ALS, within two years from onset and 
686 
100 % of patients with bulbar-onset disease 194. Several strategies can be implemented to reduce the 
687 
effects of dysphagia in patients, including dietary changes such as modification of the consistency of the 
688 
diet, the use of fluid thickeners and prescription of high-protein and high-caloric supplements, 
689 
swallowing facilitating manoeuvers and exercises (such as oral and pharyngeal range-of-motion 
690 
exercises, head postures and the technique of supraglottic swallow). An option for severe difficulties 
691 
with swallowing is to use enteral nutrition via the insertion of a gastrostomy tube. No established 
692 
criteria are available for the initiation of enteral nutrition in patients with ALS, but weight loss of >5% or 
693 
unsafe swallowing are generally considered to be red flags that should prompt intervention. 175. Several 
694 
techniques are available for minimally invasive tube insertion and open surgery is not recommended 195, 
695 
196. Parenteral nutrition provided through a central venous catheter is an alternative to enteral nutrition 
696 
  
 
23 
in patients with ALS who have severe respiratory insufficiency for whom PEG [Au: Percutaneous 
697 
endoscopic gastrostomy] or RIG [Au: Radiologically Inserted Gastrostomy? are contraindicated 197, 198.  
698 
 
699 
[H3] Dysarthria. Dysarthria is the presenting symptom in 30% of patients and is found in > 80% of 
700 
patients during the course of the disease, up to complete anarthria. Speech therapy can delay the 
701 
progression of dysarthria  and  augmentative-alternative communication  [techniques such as 
702 
customised  software are the treatment of choice and can enhance quality of life in the most advanced 
703 
phases of ALS 199. Communication techniques based on brain-computer interfaces (BEST LEAVE THIS IN 
704 
PLACE] have been developed, but their use in the clinical setting is still very limited as their effectiveness 
705 
has not been definitely demonstrated 200. Moreover, the use of brain-computer interfaces might be 
706 
hindered �� ��������� ��������� ����������� �� ��� ��� 201. 
707 
 
708 
[H3] Deep venous thrombosis. Patients with ALS have leg weakness and reduced mobility, which can 
709 
increase the risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The annual 
710 
incidence of DVT in patients with ALS ranges from 2.7 to 11.2% 202, 203. In the absence of specific studies 
711 
on the prevention and treatment of DVT in ALS general guidelines should be applied, including the use 
712 
of compression stockings and anticoagulation therapies  
713 
 
714 
[H3] Mood alterations. Depression is a relatively common symptom in patients with ALS and has been 
715 
found in up to 50% of patients. Depression is generally treated with selective serotonin reuptake 
716 
inhibitors (SSRI) or tricyclic antidepressants. Pseudobulbar affect (that is, episodes of uncontrollable 
717 
crying or laughing) is a distressing symptom that has been reported in up to 50% of patients with ALS 204 
718 
[and can be treated with  SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, although this is off-label. 
719 
Dextromethorphan (a sigma-1-receptor agonist and an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist) and 
720 
low-dose quinidine were effective in reducing symptoms  of pseudobulbar affect by 50% in patients with 
721 
ALS or those with multiple sclerosis 205.  
722 
 
723 
[H3] Cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment, in particular frontotemporal dementia, is one of the 
724 
most disabling symptoms in patients with ALS. No pharmacological therapy is effective for the treatment 
725 
of frontotemporal dementia, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which are used for Alzheimer disease, 
726 
are not effective. However, some symptoms of frontotemporal dementia can be pharmacologically 
727 
treated; evidence suggests SSRIs might help to control the loss of inhibition, overeating and compulsive 
728 
  
 
24 
behaviour, and antipsychotics can be used to reduce restlessness. Education of caregivers about the 
729 
symptoms of frontotemporal dementia can be useful to help the management of patients at home 206. 
730 
 
731 
[H3] Respiratory insufficiency.  
732 
The vast majority of patients with ALS die from respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilation is the 
733 
symptomatic treatment of choice for respiratory failure, and provides significantly longer survival 
734 
compared to those who do not use NIV (316 vs 229 days) and improves quality of life 207 208. Accepted 
735 
criteria for starting non-invasive ventilation are symptoms or signs related to respiratory muscle 
736 
weakness (such as, dyspnoea, orthopnoea or daytime fatigue), a vital capacity of < 80% of predicted 
737 
levels, PaCo2 > 45 mmHg, SaO2 < ��� ������ � 5% of sleep time  176. One distressing symptom that is 
738 
related to respiratory muscle weakness in patients with ALS is the inability to cough effectively. This can 
739 
be controlled by the use of cough-assist devices, such as the breath-stacking technique or a mechanical 
740 
insufflator-exsufflator 209.  
741 
 
742 
[H2] End of Life Management  
743 
The end of life phase for patients with ALS can be difficult to define, although recent staging systems 
744 
including KINGS and MITOS  [are useful in this regard. The end of life period can be particularly 
745 
challenging and is characterized by substantial mobility, communication and, in some cases, cognitive 
746 
difficulties. An early discussion of end of life issues will ensure that patients can communicate their 
747 
wishes before the onset of substantial communication and cognitive difficulties, can avoid unwanted 
748 
interventions or procedures, and can provide time for reflection and the integration of choices within 
749 
��� ��������� ���������� ��� ���� ������ I� ��������� ���� ����������� ��� ��������� ��������� �����, especially 
750 
around fatally choking. The attitudes, culture and personal values of patients, caregivers and health care 
751 
providers can influence the timing and content of end of life discussions, decision-making and the 
752 
��������� acceptance or refusal of interventions and treatment options. Some patients with ALS might 
753 
choose life-prolonging measures, but others might contemplate life-limiting procedures; the availability 
754 
and utilization of different interventions and technologies, such as assisted death and tracheostomy, 
755 
varies across centres and between countries. Advance care directives are recognized as important at 
756 
end of life in ALS, and provide patients with the option to exercise autonomy regarding preferred end of 
757 
life management strategies. Formal care at the end of life should aim to maximize quality of life of both 
758 
the patient and caregiver and, where possible, incorporate appropriate multidisciplinary care including 
759 
palliative care options.  
760 
  
 
25 
 
761 
[H1] Quality of Life 
762 
 
763 
Much of the effort of physicians and other health care providers is focused on optimizing the quality of 
764 
life (QOL) of patients with ALS. [Au: green text moved to here for flow. OK] The choice of a specific QOL 
765 
instrument is complex, and has been reviewed 210. The perception by individuals with ALS of their QOL 
766 
takes shape at the time of disclosing the diagnosis, and can be influenced by the manner in which they 
767 
are informed . Well-recognized systematic approaches are available, such as the SPIKES approach, that 
768 
can convey the diagnosis in a less distressing manner and can leave the patient feeling hopeful and 
769 
supported 211-213.  
770 
 
771 
 �A�� I��� ������� ��� ���� ������� ������� ����������� ����� ��� QOL �� �������� ���� �� ������� �� ������ 
772 
and that HRQOL is not the same as QOL� �� ���� ����� ������ ����� Health-related QOL (HRQOL) refers 
773 
�� �� ������������ ���������� of their QOL as a function of physical and mental well-being 214; measures 
774 
of HRQOL generally decline as ALS advances 210, 215. In contrast, OQOL [Au: overall QOL?] encompasses 
775 
medical factors and a wide variety of non-medical factors, such as family, friends, occupation, financial 
776 
well-being, spirituality or religion and existential concerns 216. Patients with ALS often view their OQOL 
777 
as good, which persists despite the progression of physical disability 217, 218. This might be explained by a 
778 
�response shift� �also called a frame shift or well-being paradox), whereby the individual recalibrates the 
779 
factors that are deemed meaningful to maintenance of their QOL. Most commonly, this centres around 
780 
the decreased importance of physical activities and the greater role of interactive and existential factors, 
781 
such as social relationships and spirituality 219-221. However, not all patients maintain a high QOL with 
782 
advancing illness. Many factors can negatively affect QOL in patients with ALS, identifying potential 
783 
areas for intervention, although other factors can improve QOL (Figure 5) 180, 207, 214, 222-228 [Au: please 
784 
restrict the number of references here to 1-2] .  
785 
 
786 
Despite good QOL of patients with ALS in aggregate �A�� ���� ���� QOL �� ���� �������� ���� ALS�� 
787 
edited for brevity] , psychological health is, on average, poorer than that of the population as a whole 
788 
229. This has substantial implications as depression, hopelessness and anxiety all associated with a poor 
789 
QOL. �A�� I��� ����� ��� ����� ���� to here from earlier on for flow] Psychological interventions have 
790 
  
 
26 
been less well studied [Au: than what? please add a comparator here] 230 and  this warrants further 
791 
attention.  
792 
 
793 
  
794 
QOL can affect the wishes for care of patients with ALS at the end of their lives. [Au: edited for flow] In a 
795 
study from the Netherlands, 16.8% of patients with ALS chose physician-assisted death, common 
796 
reasons for which were hopelessness, loss of dignity, dependency on others and fatigue 215. Similarly, 
797 
the decision for euthanasia in patients with ALS in Washington State was driven by loss of autonomy, 
798 
participation in enjoyable activities and dignity 216. These studies do not prove poor QOL in these 
799 
individuals, but they do raise this as a concern. The quality of death in patients with ALS has been 
800 
studied less comprehensively [Au: than QOL?] . Death was perceived as peaceful by 88% to 98% of 
801 
caregivers in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada 217, 231.However, caution must 
802 
be used in interpreting grouped statistics. Incompletely relieved symptoms such as coughing from [Au: 
803 
excess?] mucus, restlessness, anxiety and muscle [Au: added muscle here] cramps resulted in moderate 
804 
to severe suffering in the last 24 hours of life in 8 of 171 patients 217.  
805 
 
806 
 [H1] Outlook  
807 
 
808 
The knowledge of ALS and the care of patients with this condition have increased substantially in recent 
809 
years, and this trend is likely to continue. 25 years ago, riluzole had not been enrolled in a clinical trial, 
810 
non-invasive ventilation was not in routine use for patients, the pathological basis of ALS as a TDP-43 
811 
proteinopathy was unknown and no genetic causes for ALS had been identified. In addition, the El 
812 
Escorial criteria were not developed, no simple ALS functional scale existed, multidisciplinary care was in 
813 
its infancy and the recognition of cognitive change in patients with ALS was limited, and the link with 
814 
frontotemporal dementia was not made. What will be different in another 25 years, and how much of 
815 
what we regard as self-evident now, will be overturned, is tempting to consider. 
816 
 
817 
[H2] Epidemiology 
818 
We can expect that the numbers of patients with ALS will increase in the future 218, and that population 
819 
differences in incidence and phenotype will be recognized. Better multidisciplinary care and an 
820 
improved understanding of interventions means that a patient diagnosed with ALS can expect to live 
821 
  
 
27 
longer than previously. In addition, the development of new drugs to improve respiratory function or 
822 
directly affect the disease process are expected to improve survival.  
823 
 
824 
[H2] Pathophysiology 
825 
A big barrier to effective ALS treatments is due to our lack of knowledge of the pathological pathways 
826 
that lead to the disease, and how they affect the overall integrity of brain networks. Our understanding 
827 
of ALS is improving, including contextualizing the role of TDP-43, the importance of RNA processing for 
828 
motor neurons, the spread of disease and the molecular cascades that lead to neuronal death. The 
829 
development of new cellular and animal models of ALS is beginning to lead to improvements in our 
830 
understanding of the disease , both because the molecular pathways can be dissected more easily, and 
831 
because the models can be used to more effectively to identify drugs worth enrolling into human trials. 
832 
These insights are the result of genetic findings, which have led to experiments aiming to understand 
833 
how loss-of normal protein function and gain-of toxic function cause ALS. As the number of genes 
834 
implicated in ALS increases and laboratory models improve, we can expect to design new drugs to 
835 
intervene in those pathways.  
836 
 
837 
Indeed, our understanding of the genetics of ALS has transformed over the last 25 years, with the 
838 
finding that both familial and sporadic ALS have a genetic basis and the number of validated involved 
839 
genes steadily increasing. These findings are in large part due to the willingness of the ALS research 
840 
community to collaborate, which has generated the huge datasets required for credible gene discovery. 
841 
The finding that the genetic architecture of ALS includes an important role for rare genetic variation has 
842 
consequences for the likelihood that gene therapy could be effective in this disease. Indeed, as rare 
843 
variants are more likely to have a large effect on the risk of disease and can be directly manipulated by 
844 
gene therapy, we can expect to see precision medicine spearheaded by targeted gene therapies. 
845 
The relationship between ALS and cognitive, cerebellar, autonomic and other non-motor changes is an 
846 
area of research that is expected to grow. One consequence of this research is that ALS is probably 
847 
primarily a disease of neural networks, which is defined by the involvement of upper and lower motor 
848 
neurons, but that can also affect other cell populations and neuronal networks. We can also expect an 
849 
increased understanding of the role of inflammation in ALS, both in triggering disease and influencing 
850 
the rate of progression.  
851 
 
852 
[H2] Diagnosis and prognosis 
853 
  
 
28 
The use of biomarkers for ALS has been investigated for many years, although our understanding has 
854 
only recently matured for research to yield useful results.  Diagnostic biomarkers would be useful for 
855 
individuals with an atypical or complicated presentation, biomarkers for prognosis would be useful for 
856 
planning treatment options, and biomarkers of disease progression would be useful for monitoring 
857 
response to existing therapies or potential new therapies in a clinical trial. New signal analysis based 
858 
technologies will become available as biomarkers that can image the living human brain 139.

[H3] Clinical Trials  
863 
 The validity of pre-clinical studies should be evaluated rigorously by evidence-based analyses, and 
864 
translation of new therapies to humans should be undertaken only if findings are robust and 
865 
reproducible. Moreover, as ALS is a human disease, testing safe candidate compounds without prior 
866 
testing in animal models could be undertaken. In this instance, careful phase I and 2 studies including 
867 
detailed pharmacokinetic studies with extensive dose-finding and toxicity studies will be needed. As 
868 
some previous ALS clinical trials failed due to faulty trial design, a detailed correlative analysis of drug 
869 
levels in serum and CSF should be undertaken in early phases trials, and all trials should include a 
870 
biomarker readout to confirm that the drug is reaching its target. �A�� ���� �� ��� ���� �� ������� 
871 
������������ P����� �������� .  
872 
 
873 
 The failure of previous clinical trials for ALS could also result from disease heterogeneity. Methods to 
874 
stratify patients that have a shared pathobiology are urgently required, and in the absence of this, pre-
875 
specified, post-hoc analyses should be used to identify potential responder groups. This is exemplified 
876 
by a recent successful Phase 3 trial of edaravone 184, as recruitment to this trial was based on a post-hoc 
877 
analysis to identify possible responders, and stringent recruitment criteria were used to provide a 
878 
clinically homogeneous population that were likely to respond to treatment.  
879 
 
880 
[H3] New Drugs  
881 
An extensive pipeline of new therapeutics for ALS is available, and some of these drugs target known 
882 
mutations and pathogenetic pathways.  Symptomatic therapies including tirazemptiv based on 
883 
improving respiratory function in patients with ALS are currently in Phase 3 trials and exciting Phase I 
884 
trials  assessing the use of antisense oligonucleotides in SOD1 and C9orf72 [related ALS are underway. In 
885 
  
 
29 
the future, treatments are likely to be targeted at specific subgroups of patients and biomarkers that are 
886 
personalized to the individual disease subtype and have been developed from patient subcohorts that 
887 
have been extensively phenotyped and stratified using genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and 
888 
advanced imaging and signal analysis.

Transgenic mice with mutations in SOD1 (encoding superoxide dismutase, SOD1 �A�� I��� ����� ���

900 
over-express mutant SOD1 and many have an aggressive disease course over approximately 80-90 days. 
901 
However, they display quite well clinical and pathological features similar to human ALS.

917 
[Au: cell death of the motor neurons only, or also of astrocytes and oligos?] in healthy control motor 
918 
neurons. Glial toxicity is mediated through both contact (lactate independent) and soluble mechanisms 
919 
and is rescued by SOD1 knockdown using short hairpin RNA  in glia derived from patients with AOS1-
920 
related familial ALS, but also in glia derived from patients with sporadic ALS without SOD1 mutation 113.  
921 
Wild-type and mutant SOD1 proteins form insoluble  intraneuronal fibrils, which aggregate with 
922 
increased propensity in the mutant form. A prion-like transmission of mutant SOD1 fibrils can seed wild-

implicated in ALS and has been linked to the most pathophysiological mechanisms, although the effects 
960 
of mutations in  ALS3 and ALS7 are still unknown. Aberrant RNA metabolism and impaired protein

980 
incorporate cognitive or behavioural changes. The King�s staging system is sensitive to early changes in
