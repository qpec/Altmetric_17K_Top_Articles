ABSTRACT    
Objective:  To report 3-year outcomes of a prospective, multi-center, randomized, 
blinded control trial after treatment with convective radiofrequency (RF) water vapor 
thermal therapy for moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to 
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

months, thermal therapy subjects were followed annually for 3 years.   
Results:  Convective RF thermal therapy yielded IPSS improvements 160% when 
compared to control subjects at 3 months (p<0.0001).  Maximal symptom relief of at 
least 50% improvements in IPSS, quality of life, Qmax, and BPH Impact Index remained 
durable throughout 3 years (p<0.0001).  Subjects with a treated median lobe had similar 
responses.  No late related adverse events occurred and no de novo erectile 
dysfunction was reported.  The surgical retreatment rate was 4.4% over 3 years.   
Conclusion:  The minimally invasive convective RF thermal therapy is an office or 
ambulatory outpatient procedure with minimal transient perioperative side effects.  It 
provides early effective and durable relief of BPH symptoms with preservation of sexual

Introduction 
The emergence of minimally invasive treatment for bothersome LUTS/BPH adds to the 
armamentarium of available therapies before or after initial medical management.  This 
is particularly true in men who cannot tolerate side effects of medication, have 
unrealized expectations for symptom relief, may not be compliant with long-term use of 
costly drugs or wish to avoid potential complications of invasive surgical procedures.  
Traditional thermal therapies such as conductive transurethral needle ablation of the 
prostate (TUNA) and transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) as alternatives to 
surgical intervention have declined in use.1  A novel technology utilizing convective 
radiofrequency (RF) water vapor th r al th ra   (     ® System) received Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in 2015.  The principles of the technology and 
effective ablation of prostate adenomas were validated in histological and magnetic 
resonance imaging studies.2, 3   h  a vantag  o  th        S st   is th   s  o  
convective heat energy compared with tissue ablation using conductive heat transfer 
(TUNA or TUMT).  The latter induces molecular agitation within a tissue mass after 
direct contact between two surfaces at different temperatures; this causes a thermal 
gradient.  Consequently, higher temperatures and longer periods of heating are required 
to achieve a therapeutic temperature in the target tissue via conduction versus 
convection.  In the case of convective heating, there is instead a phase change of water 
vapor (steam) to liquid such that the energy moves through the tissue confined only by 
natural collagen barriers (adenoma pseudocapsule) inducing cell death without 
  si  ation, li it   to th    N al’s transitional   rostati   on ,4 and a temperature no 
more than 103° C.

     The convective RF thermal therapy has been shown to provide rapid and significant 
improvements in bothersome LUTS, preserve erectile and ejaculatory function, and 
enhance quality of life in patients with moderate to severe symptoms.5-7  The 
reproducibility of responses and sustained relief of LUTS with minimal side effects and 
no delayed adverse events was demonstrated over 2 years8,9 and also in 1-year 
outcomes from consecutive cases by community urologists following FDA clearance of 
the device.10  Continued scrutiny and assessment of durability is important to 
understand the role of the convective RF thermal therapy in management of patients 
with LUTS/BPH.  This report provides the 3-year results of the multicenter RCT of the 
thermal therapy, improvements based on initial severity of LUTS and demonstrates the 
ability to treat all zones of the prostate.  
 
Materials and Methods 
Study protocol 
The prospective, multi-center, double-blinded study of the safety and effectiveness of 
the       System convective RF thermal therapy was conducted in 15 centers in the 
United States (Clincaltrials.gov: NCT01912339) with intent to follow up annually for 5 
years.  The protocol was approved by Institutional Review Boards at each enrolling 
center and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.  Enrollment criteria 
included men with moderate to severe symptomatic BPH,  those at least 50 years of 
ag   ith an   nt rnational Prostat  S   to  S or  ( PSS) ≥ 13, a  rostat  vol    30 
   to 80   ,  a i     rinar   lo  rat  (Q a ) o  ≤15  l/s   an  a   as r    ost 
voiding residual (PVR) urine < 250 mL.  Exclusion criteria included a PSA >2.5 ng/ml 
Page 7 of 37
 8 
 
with a free PSA < 25% (unless prostate cancer was ruled out by biopsy) and any active 
urinary tract infection.  There were no morphological contraindications for use of this 
thermal therapy procedure in subjects with an intravesical median lobe or hyperplasia of 
the central zone.  A total of 197 subjects stratified by IPSS severity were randomized 
2 1 to th r al th ra    ith th          vi   (n=136) or sha /control procedure with 
rigid cystoscopy (n=61).  Participants were required to undergo a washout and 
discontinue use of any medications for LUTS/BPH prior to treatment.5  A second aspect 
of the RCT included a crossover design trial of the RF thermal therapy after the control 
procedure.  After unblinding at 3 months, control subjects who elected to proceed were 
re-qualified for the crossover study.9 
Statistical Methods 
Randomization was conducted prior to treatment with electronic programming using 
permuted blocks of various sizes chosen at random, stratified by investigational site.  
Subjects were allocated in a 2:1 ratio to thermal treatment and control arms 
respectively.  To ensure balance between the randomized arms at each study site, 
subjects were first stratified by severity of symptoms, with baseline IPSS 13 to 18 
( o  rat ) an   PSS ≥19 (s v r ) to  ns r   q al  istri  tion in  oth ar s.  The study 
was powered at 80% with 0.025 1-sided type I error for the primary end point of IPSS 
reduction at 3 months,  sing a St   nt’s t-test on the intent-to-treat populations to 
compare mean changes in treatment and control arms.  Descriptive statistics were used 
to describe baseline and follow-up values for all variables.  To evaluate longitudinal 
change from baseline a general estimation equation (GEE) model was fit to each 
outcome parameter using an exchangeable working correlation structure.11  The GEE 
Page 8 of 37
 9 
 
model takes into account the correlation within a subject over time and uses that 
information to adjust the estimates and confidence intervals.  Change from baseline is 
the dependent variable; visit and baseline score are used as independent variables.  
The model was used to calculate p-values for each follow-up evaluation compared to 
baseline.  
Procedures 
Descriptions of the convective RF thermal therapy technology, device and treatment 
procedural techniques have been reported in detail.5,7,10  Briefly, the system utilizes RF-
generated water vapor (~103° C) thermal energy based on the thermodynamic 
properties of convective versus conductive heat transfer to ablate prostate tissue.  The 
hand-held transurethral delivery device with a standard reusable 4 mm, 30° rigid lens 
allows placement of the retractable needle under direct cystoscopic visualization; a 
saline flush irrigation is used to enhance visualization and cool the urethra.  The 
treatment needle has a total of 12 small emitter holes spaced around its tip to allow 
circumferential dispersion of thermal energy to create an approximate 1.5 to 2.0-cm 
lesion which is confined within the prostate zone in which the treatment is delivered.  
For treatment, the needle tip is positioned and inserted starting approximately 1 cm 
distal to the bladder neck into the transition and central prostate adenoma.  Intravesical 
prostatic protrusions are injected starting 1 cm from the edge of the protrusion.  The 
total number of treatments in each lobe of the prostate is determined by the length of 
the prostatic urethra and can be customized to the configuration of the gland including 
the median lobe/enlarged central zone.  The treatment requires repositioning the 
retractable needle after each water vapor injection approximately 1 cm distal from the 
Page 9 of 37
 10 
 
previous site to the end of the prostatic urethra proximal to the verumontanum.  The 
thermal therapy creates contiguous, overlapping lesions running parallel to the natural 
slope of the urethra.  The control procedure involved rigid cystoscopy and activation of 
th  s st   g n rator o tsi   th  s  j  t’s  o   to  i i  th  so n  o  th  a tiv  
procedure.  A surgical barrier prevented subject visualization of the treating physician 
and device.   
Study Assessments 
The double blind was maintained through the 3-month comparison of the active and 
sham/ control groups for the primary efficacy endpoint, after which all subjects were 
unblinded.  Outcome assessments were performed by an assessor blinded to the 
procedures.  Control subjects who requalified by inclusion criteria were eligible to 
participate in a crossover study to receive thermal therapy.9  The RF thermal therapy 
subjects were followed for 3 years and assessed for symptom relief (IPSS), quality of 
life measures (IPSS-QOL, BH Impact Index [BPHII]), peak urinary flow rate (Qmax), 
incontinence (Over Active Bladder Questionnaire-Short Form [OAB-q SF], International 
Continence Society Male Incontinence Scale questionnaire-Short Form [ICS male IS-
SF]), sexual function (International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF-15], Male Sexual 
Health Questionnaire for Ejaculatory Dysfunction [MSHQ-EjD]) and acute and late 
occurring adverse events.  Any subject who received RF thermal therapy is included in 
annual follow-up evaluations for 5 years.  Independent data monitoring and clinical 
events committees reviewed safety and adjudicated adverse events.

Results 
Study enrollment between September 2013 and August 2014 included 197 subjects, of 
whom 136 were randomized to convective RF thermal therapy and 61 to the 
sham/control procedure (Fig. 1).  For the active treatment cohort, the mean age was 63 
± 7.1 years, mean prostate volume 45.8 ± 13 cc, and mean baseline IPSS of 22.0 ± 4.8.  
The control subjects had similar characteristics.5  After the 3-month blinded comparison, 
53 of 61 control subjects who again met IPSS and Qmax eligibility criteria elected to 
participate in a crossover active treatment study.  Results of the per protocol analysis 
with a 2-year follow-up and a crossover study were reported previously.5,9  RF thermal 
therapy treatments were performed on the median lobe/enlarged central zone of 58/188 
(30.9%) subjects in the original randomized and crossover studies.  The total number of 
RF water vapor treatments in each lobe of the prostate was determined by the length of 
the hyperplastic prostatic tissue and customized to the configuration of the gland.  The 
number of treatments to prostate zones was a mean 4.7 ± 1.7 and 1.6 ± 0.7 to the 
median lobe when present.  All procedures were performed in an office or ambulatory 
surgery center and successfully completed without perioperative device or procedure-
related adverse events.  Management of pain and anxiety was controlled at investigator 
discretion.  Anesthesia was variable; 69% received oral sedation only, 21% prostate 
block and 10% intravenous sedation.5 
     The IPSS improvements after thermal therapy at the primary endpoint analysis 
(intention-to-treat) at 3 months were significant (-11.2 ± 7.6 points reduction) compared 
Page 11 of 37
 12 
 
to the control group (-4.3 ± 6.9 points), p<0.0001.5  The early response of the 50% 
improvement in IPSS (baseline 22.0 ± 4.8) was consistently sustained at this level 
throughout 3 years of follow-up, Table 1.  The longitudinal profile of IPSS improvements 
is shown in Figure 2A; it is closely replicated in a cumulative total of 384 subjects 
treated with convective RF thermal therapy in this RCT and in previously published 
studies.8-10  Without exception, the seven individual domains of the IPSS for voiding and 
storage functions indicated significant relief of symptoms at 1 month to 2 years after 
convective RF thermal therapy9 and remained significant throughout 3 years, p<0.0001 
(Fig. 2B, 2C).  
     Corresponding and durable improvements in urinary flowrate (Qmax), quality of life 
and incontinence assessments were significant compared to baseline, p<0.0001 (Table 
1).  The increased urinary flow of >50% from 3 to 24 months fell off slightly to 39% at 36 
months. Symptomatic relief reflected in IPSS and Qmax outcomes was achieved in 
subjects with moderate and severe LUTS (Supplementary Fig. S1, Fig. S2).  The 
percentage of symptom improvement is commensurate with symptom severity at 
baseline, i.e., higher improvement with higher baseline scores, but not dependent on 
baseline Qmax.  S  j  ts  ho   r  not s   all  a tiv  (r  ort   “ i  not att   t 
int r o rs ”) on th    EF-15 prior to treatment were censored from sexual function 
analyses.6  The sexually active 90/135 (67%) subjects had no negative changes in IIEF-
EF and MSHQ-EjD function scores throughout 3-years of follow-up, however the 
ejaculatory bother score (MSHQ-EjD) improved over baseline from 12 to 36 months 
(p<0.03).  Further evaluation of the minimal clinically important differences in erectile 
function, perceptible as a benefit to the patient,12 showed improvements in 29/90 (32%) 
Page 12 of 37
 13 
 
subjects at 3 months and 21/77 (27%) at 12 months after treatment,5 that remained 
durable in 10/62 (16%) subjects at 36 months, Supplementary Table S1. 
     Of the 135 subjects, 42 (22%) had a median lobe/central zone enlargement identified 
and 30/42 (71%) received thermal therapy (Table 2).  Subjects with a treated median 
lobe and those without a median lobe (93/135) had similar significant improvements in 
IPSS and urinary flow rate throughout 36 months.  After ablation of the median lobe, 
these 30 subjects had significantly decreased PVR from 24 to 36 months (p <0.04, 
adjusted for baseline PVR).  At 36 months the decrease in PVR was to 54.8 mL (61% 
the baseline mean of 90.2 ± 57.2) compared with 14.2 mL (18% the baseline mean of 
77.7 ± 49.0) in subjects without a treated median lobe, p = 0.0109.       
     Adverse events reported were infrequent and of short duration.  The most common 
were dysuria (16.9%), hematuria (11.8%), frequency and urgency (5.9%), acute urinary 
retention (3.7%) and urinary tract infection suspected (3.7%); all were treated routinely 
or resolved without treatment within 3 weeks.9  There were no late occurring related 
adverse events.  No de novo erectile dysfunction was reported. 
      A total of 97/135 (72%) subjects treated with convective RF thermal therapy were 
available for the 3-year evaluations.  Of the 38 subjects excluded from analysis, 14 were 
lost to follow-up, 7 withdrew consent (1 with a cancer diagnosis), 5 were censored for 
use of BPH medications and 4 for use of testosterone at time of follow-up, 2 missed a 
clinic visit, and 6 underwent a secondary treatment for LUTS (one subject had open 
prostatectomy, three had a plasma-button transurethral vaporization of the prostate, and 
t o   r  r tr at    ith      ).   h s, th  r tr at  nt rat   ith a s rgi al or  ini all

six secondary interventions were related to presence of a median lobe, identified but not

Comment 
This report presents the longest-term follow up to date of a randomized trial for 
convective RF thermal therapy for treatment of bothersome LUTS.  The significant 
improvements in symptoms, both storage and voiding functions, quality of life 
measures, urinary flow rates and incontinence measures are durable throughout 3 
years.  Sexual function was preserved; erectile function remained improved and durable 
in the subset of sexually active subjects.  Notable is the reproducibility of symptom relief 
with profiles of improvements in IPSS that mirror results in published studies including a 
real-world experience with community urologists.8-10  This corroboration of nearly 
identical outcomes in a variety of patient cohorts and settings is significant in meeting 
expectations for care of a variety of patients beyond the realm of a randomized clinical 
trial involving strict enrollment criteria.  This tight correlation speaks to a strong sense 
generalizability of the technology as it transitions from experimental to standard 
treatment option.  Baseline severity of symptoms is known to influence treatment 
outcomes.13 As shown in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, IPSS outcomes based on 
severity of LUTS indicates that subjects with both moderate and severe LUTS had 
significant symptomatic relief.

     The convective RF thermal therapy is unique among other minimally invasive 
thermal therapies.  The procedure is a TUNA approach, but with considerably more 
efficient convective delivery of thermal energy to heat and ablate tissue compared to 
conductive delivery using currently available traditional TUNA and TUMT systems.  The 
convective RF thermal procedure has several advantages:  It is a very efficient 
procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting with use of oral sedation or 
local anesthesia in most cases.  Ablation can be targeted precisely to those zones of 
the prostate with obstructive tissue, and customized to the configuration of individual 
prostate glands including intravesical prostatic protrusions of either lateral or median 
lobes.  In this RCT, subjects with a median lobe or central zone hyperplasia achieved 
similar significant relief of symptoms as those without this anatomic hyperplasia.   
     The BPH surgical retreatment was low at 4.4% over 3 years and primarily related to 
the failure to initially treat the median lobe in 4/135 (3%) subjects.  This rate is 
considerably less than the variable re-operation rates for TUNA and TUMT followed for 
up to 5 years,14-18 however a direct temporal comparison cannot be made with 
convective RF thermal therapy.  The retreatment rate is similar to that reported in a 
study of over 6,000 transurethral surgical patients: rate of 4% after resection and 6% 
after laser vaporization patients at 3 years and new BPH oral medications were started 
among 22% of initial responders to surgery.19  A reoperation rate of 4% occurred up to 3 
years after plasma-button enucleation of the prostate.20  The surgical retreatment rate 
for LUTS/BPH after a mechanical procedure of a prostatic urethral lift was (15/140) 
10.7% at 3 years.21

     Symptomatic men with moderate to severe LUTS/BPH who wish to move beyond 
watchful waiting could consider convective RF water vapor thermal therapy as a low-risk 
treatment in the continuum between medical management and more invasive surgical 
approaches.  The one-time procedure provides rapid, significant and durable relief of 
LUTS/BPH in contrast to a lifetime commitment of pharmaceutical agents and their 
undesirable side effects and lower-than-desired symptom improvement. 
     As reimbursement for patient care moves from volume-based services to value-
based services, cost-effectiveness coupled with appreciable symptom relief for 
LUTS/BPH plays an important role.  For example, the TUNA procedure with conductive 
heat delivery system compared favorably with combination medical therapy when 
viewed over a 5-year period.22  Similarly the cost-effectiveness of convective RF heat 
  liv r  (      System) compares favorably within the spectrum of BPH treatment 
options including drugs, minimally invasive therapies, and invasive surgeries (TURP 
and photovaporization of prostate).23  Utilization of the convective RF thermal therapy 
procedure could lead to a reduction in inpatient hospitalization required with TURP.  
Furthermore, although generic combination drugs are the least expensive therapy for 
LUTS and branded combination drugs the most expensive, both are less effective than 
any minimally invasive therapy, including convective RF thermal therapy, over a 2-year 
period.  Surgical intervention provides slightly greater relief of LUTS than minimally 
invasive modalities, however, at nearly twice the cost over a 2-year horizon.  Typically 
these more invasive and aggressive surgeries are reserved for larger prostate glands 
and subjects with underactive bladder function.  With consideration of the profiles of 
safety, no reported occurrences of ED or erectile dysfunction, and durability of LUTS 
Page 16 of 37

relief as well as cost-effectiveness, convective RF water vapor thermal therapy warrants 
use as a first-line of treatment for moderate to severe LUTS/BPH, and within the 
armamentarium of available treatments, it also represents a legitimate alternative to 
transurethral removal of obstructed tissue in selected patients.   
 
Conclusion 
Convective RF water vapor thermal therapy of benign prostate adenomas represents a 
unique minimally invasive and durable modality for men with bothersome moderate to 
severe LUTS.  The thermal therapy warrants positioning as a procedure for LUTS relief, 
both as an initial therapy versus medications and as an alternative to transurethral 
surgery for selected patients.
