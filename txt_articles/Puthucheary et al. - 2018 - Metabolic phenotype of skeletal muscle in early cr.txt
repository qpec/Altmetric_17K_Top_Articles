Running Title: Skeletal muscle phenotype in early critical illness 
 
What is the key question? 
To investigate if adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioavailability and lipid metabolism 
are drivers of the early and rapidly acute skeletal muscle wasting that occurs during 
critical illness. 
 
What is the bottom line? 
Skeletal muscle wasting in critical care is associated with impaired lipid oxidation and 
reduced ATP bioavailability, driven by intramuscular inflammation and altered 
hypoxic signaling which may account for the inconsistent outcome observed in the 
nutrition and exercise clinical trials. 
 
Why read on? 
In this first study to investigate the relationship between bioenergetics changes and 
skeletal muscle muscle wasting during early critical illness, alterations in fat 
metabolism and ATP abundance are associated with the severity of inflammation 
and altered oxygen signaling, which could be considered as targets for future 
therapies.

 ABSTRACT 
Objectives: To characterise the sketetal muscle metabolic phenotype during early 
critical illness 
Methods: Vastus Lateralis muscle biopsies and serum samples (days 1 and 7) were 
obtained from 63 intensive care patients (59% male 54.7 ± 18.0 years APACHE II 
score 23.5 ± 6.5). 
Measurements and Main Results: From day 1 to 7, there was a reduction in 
mitochondrial beta-oxidation enzyme concentrations, mitochondrial biogenesis 
markers (PGC1α mRNA expression (-27.4CN (95%CI -123.9-14.3); n=23; p=0.025) and 
mitochondrial DNA copy number (-1859CN (IQR -5557-1325); n=35; p=0.032). 
Intramuscular ATP content was reduced compared to controls on day 1 
(17.7mmol/kg/dw (95%CI 15.3-20.0) vs. 21.7mmol/kg/dw (95%CI 20.4-22.9); 
p<0.001) and decreased over 7 days (-4.8 mmol/kg dw (IQR -8.0—1.2); n=33; 
p=0.001). In addition, the ratio of phosphorylated:total AMP-K (the bioenergetic 
sensor) increased (0.52 (IQR -0.09-2.6) n=31; p<0.001).  There was an increase in 
intramuscular phosphocholine  (847.2AU (IQR 232.5-1672); n=15; p=0.022), 
intramuscular TNFR1 (0.66 μg IQR-0.44-3.33 n=29; p=0.041) and IL-10 (13.6ng IQR 
3.4-39.0; n=29; p=0.004). Serum adiponectin (10.3μg (95%CI 6.8-13.7); p<0.001) and 
ghrelin (16.0ng/ml (IQR -7-100); p=0.028) increased. Network analysis revealed a 
close and direct relationship between bioenergetic impairment and reduction in 
muscle mass and between intramuscular inflammation and impaired anabolic 
signaling.  ATP content and muscle mass were unrelated to lipids delivery. 
Conclusions: Decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and dysregulated lipid oxidation 
contribute to compromised skeletal muscle bioenergetic status. In addition, 
intramuscular inflammation was associated with impaired anabolic recovery with 
lipid delivery observed as bioenergetically inert. Future clinical work will focus on 
these key areas to ameliorate acute skeletal muscle wasting.

 INTRODUCTION 
Acute skeletal muscle wasting occurs early and rapidly in critical illness1 and is 
reported to be a major driver of longterm disability2. Indeed, muscle wasting is 
associated with increased length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay1, hospital stay1 and 
mortality3. It is underpinned by a fall in muscle protein synthesis1, a process which, 
in healthy individuals, is responsive to exercise and amino acid loading 4. However, 
clinical trials of enhanced nutritional support5-8 and early exercise training 9-12 in 
acute critical illness have yielded inconsistent results in terms of amelerioration of 
muscle wasting and improvement in physical function. 
Muscle protein synthesis is ATP dependent13 14.  The observed reduction in early 
critical illness15 16 may be the result of decreased mitochondrial number or function, 
or both15 16.  These defects of metabolism may be the result of decreased substrate 
utilisation including glucose, a well-recognised complication of critical illness.  
Furthermore, the metabolic anomalies observed could be the consequence of the 
decreased utilisation of other energy substrates, such as fatty acids.  This may, in 
part, account for the failure to show benefit in the previous nutrition and exercise 
clinical trials 5-8 17 9-12. 
Systemic hypoxia and inflammation are part of the phenotype of critical illness18-20 
and both can impair mitochondrial function16 and muscle protein synthesis21 22.  
These interactions are complex23 and, as yet, incompletely elucidated with limited 
data available reporting  the relationship between loss in muscle mass and skeletal 
muscle hypoxia and inflammation. 
Whilst mitochondrial dysfunction has reported15 16 24, these data have not 
investigated the relationship with skeletal muscle wasting and muscle protein 
 turnover.  We investigated the relationships between loss in muscle mass in early 
critical illness and skeletal muscle inflammatory, hypoxic and protein homeostatic 
signaling together with the bioenergetic status. 
METHODS 
Patients were those enrolled in the previously-described MUSCLE study 
(NCT01106300, www.clinicaltrials.gov)1. Ethical approval was obtained from 
University College London Ethics Committee A. At enrolment,  written assent was 
obtained from the next-of-kin with retrospective patient consent obtained when full 
mental capacity was regained. 
 Patients were recruited within 24 hours of admission to a university hospital and a 
community hospital intensive care unit (ICU). All were anticipated to be invasively 
ventilated for >48 hours and to spend >7 days in, and survive, ICU. Patients were 
excluded if these criteria were not met and if they were pregnant or a lower limb 
amputee, or suffering primary neuromuscular disease or disseminated cancer. 
Vastus Lateralis biopsies (days 1 and 7) were performed and snap-frozen in under 10 
seconds. Serum samples (days 1, 3, 7 and 10) and physiological data were collected 
as described1.  
 
Mitochondrial components  
Electron transport chain component protein concentrations were determined, as 
were those of key enzymes of fatty acid transport (Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase-
1), beta-oxidation (Medium Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase) and oxidation of 
unsaturated fatty acids (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 1) using muscle homogenates 
(Luminex technology: Flexmap3d, Merck Millipore). The peroxisomal beta-oxidation 
 enzyme Multifunctional Enzyme-2 was quantified as was the electron transport 
system electron carrier Electron Transferring Flavoprotein (ETF) . 
 
Bioenergetic quantification 
Intramuscular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), free creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine 
(PCr) levels were fluorometrically-measured25. These were compared against 
unpublished data from  31 healthy subjects comprising  of  both those with and 
without stable chronic disease , as  per our patient cohort (Table S7). Intracellular 
energy sensor Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase (AMP-K) protein 
concentration was measured (Western Blotting). 
 
Muscle metabotyping  
Thawed muscle tissues underwent extraction and the organic phase used for ultra 
performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) 
optimised for lipid profiling as previously described26.  
 
Mitochondrial biogenesis  
Mitochondrial DNA copy number and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of 
members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 
family (PGC1α, PG1β and PPRC-1, central regulators of mitochondrial metabolism 
and biogenesis27) were independently quantified (Quantitative Polymerase Chain 
Reaction: qStandard, London UK) and reported as normalized copy number (CN). 
Expression of Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP-1; a marker of mitochondrial fission28) 
was determined.  
  
Adipokine and ghrelin response  
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA, Merck Millipore) of serum  ghrelin and 
adipokinin concentrations was performed.  
 
Intramuscular hypoxia and inflammation  
We measured intramuscular concentrations of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha 
(HIF1α, the primary hypoxia-induced transcription factor)  (Luminex technology; 
Flexmap3d, Merck Millipore) and pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines (high sensitivity 
Evidence Investigator chip array, Randox, Co Antrim). 
 
Statistical analysis 
Data were assessed for normality (D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus tests), and 
analyzed using Student’s t-test, Pearson’s coefficient, Mann-Whitney U test and 
Wilcoxon’s signed Rank Tests as appropriate.  Parametric data are reported as 
mean( confidence intervals) and non-parametric as median (Interquartile range). 
 
Metabotyping: Two forms of data reduction (principal components analysis and 
partial least squares discriminant analysis) were used for visualisation of untargeted 
profiling data. Principal component analysis (LCMS data) visualised inherent 
clustering and identified outliers. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was 
performed to maximise class differences between day 1 and day 7 samples while 
minimising variability unrelated to class. These were used to identify metabolites 
whose concentration was different between day 1 and day 3 and thus determine 
 metabolites of importance. These were then presented as raw data to confirm the 
changes identified in the multivariate methods. 
 
Network Analysis: Each variable was represented as a node, and edges weighted by 
pairwise  pearson correlation coefficient (threshold r > 0.4). Temporal changes 
(change from day 1 to day 7) in concentrations of active moieties of the 
anabolic/catabolic signaling pathways, physiological and nutritional data and muscle 
mass were included1. Clinical variables include were those that achieved statistial 
signifcance in our previously published multi-variate analysis1. MCLclust29 was 
implemented in Cytoscape (www.cytoscape.com)30 to reveal  complex relationships 
otherwise hidden. As in all network analyses, multiple comparison were not 
corrected for as p values were not determined31. 
(See Online Supplement for further methodological details). 
 
RESULTS 
 
The characteristics of the cohort have been previously described1. Of the 91 patients 
recruited, 63 fulfilled criteria for longitudinal analysis. Serial Vastus Lateralis biopsy 
samples were available from 33 patients and serum for 59, and metabotyping 
performed on a sub-cohort of 15 (figure S1). The characteristics of the whole cohort, 
patients biopsied and those metabotyped did not differ (all p>0.05), except that the 
proportion of males was higher amongst those metabotyped (80.0%, v 58.7%; 
p=0.047) (Table 1).

 Intramuscular ATP content on day 1 in critically ill patients was lower than that of 
healthy subjects (17.7mmol/kg dry weight (dw) (95%CI 15.3-20.0) vs. 21.7mmol/kg 
dw (95%CI 20.4-22.9); p=0.005) (figure 1A). Day 1 ATP content was lower in critically 
ill patients with chronic disease than in those without (13.61 mmol/kg dw (95%CI. 
9.9-17.4) vs. 21.26 mmol/kg dw (95%CI19.0-23.6); p=0.001, figure 1A). 
Correspondingly, ATP content on day 1 was similar in healthy individuals and 
critically ill patients without chronic diseases (22.17 mmol/kg dw (95%CI 20.7-23.7) 
vs. (21.26 mmol/kg dw (95%CI 18.9-23.6); p=0.383). However critically ill patients 
with pre-existing chronic disease had lower ATP content on day 1 than ambulant 
COPD controls (13.6 mmol/kg dw (95%CI 9.9-17.4) vs. 21.1 mmol/kg dw (95%CI 19.0-
23.2); p<0.001). 
ATP content declined from day 1 to day 7 in the whole cohort (-4.8 mmol/kg dw (IQR 
-8.0—1.2); n=33; p=0.001). The difference between those with and without pre-
existing chronic diseases persisted at day 7 (10.43 mmol/kg dw (95%CI 7.3-13.5) vs. 
16.47 mmol/kg dw (95%CI 14.2-18.8) respectively; p=0.002), although ATP content 
change over 7 days was no different between those with and without pre-existing 
chronic diseases (-3.18% (95%CI -8.1- 1.7) vs. -4.79% (95%CI-6.8- -2.8); p=0.503). The 
ratio of phosphorylated to total AMP-K rose from day 1 to day 7 in the critically ill 
cohort (0.88 (IQR 0.62-2.52) vs. 1.57 (IQR 0.68-3.99) n=31; p<0.001, figure 1B). 
Phosphocreatine concentration was also lower in patients than in healthy subjects 
on day 1 (41.7mmol/kg dw (95%CI 32.6-50.4) vs. 72.7mmol/kg dw (95%CI 69.0-76.4); 
p<0.001) and declined over the following 7 days (-14.7mmol/kg dw (95%CI -23.3—
6.1); n=33; p=0.039; figure 1C). Total creatine content was similar to that found in 
healthy subjects at day 1 (116.9mmol/kg dw (95%CI 105.7-128.0 vs.126.0mmol/kg 
 dw (95%CI 120.7-131.2); p=0.142; figure 1D) but declined over 7 days (-25.39 
mmol/kg dw (IQR -42.4-1.44); n=33; p<0.048). Phosphocreatine and total creatine 
content were independent of chronic disease status. 
 
Metabotyping 
A 2-component cross-validated model had an R2Y of 0.72 and Q2 of 0.41 and AUROC 
of 0.95 for predicting day of muscle sampling. Following correction for multiple 
comparisons, a decrease in intramuscular triglyceride (-1366AU (95%CI-2605--127); 
n=15; p=0.048) and an increase in intramuscular phosphocholine ((side chains 19:0, 
22:0); 847.2AU (IQR 232.5-1672); n=15; p=0.022) over 7 days retained statistical 
significance (Figure 2).  
 
Mitochondrial biogenesis 
PGC1α mRNA expression decreased (-27.4CN (95%CI -123.9-14.3); n=23; p=0.025)) 
between day 1 and 7 as did that of the marker of mitochondrial fission DRP-1 (-
42.7CN. (95%CI -77.2—8.2); n=23; p=0.018, figure S4, Table S6)). Mitochondrial DNA 
copy number also decreased over the first 7 days (-1859CN (IQR -5557-1325); n=35; 
p=0.032). No change was observed in PGC1β or PPRC1 expression over 7 days (both 
p>0.05). 
 
Adipokine and ghrelin response 
Serum adiponectin concentration increased from day 1 to day 7 (10.3μg (95%CI 6.8-
13.7); n=59; p<0.001), as did those of ghrelin (16.0ng/ml (IQR -7-100); n= 59; 
p=0.028, table S8). Both increases were sustained at day 10. Resistin concentration 
 was unchanged (-0.75μg (95%CI-1.6—0.1);n=59; p=0.918), as was leptin 
concentration (-0.01; n=59; p=0.113). In the obese subgroup (n = 16, body mass

Intramuscular HIF1α protein concentration increased from day 1 to 7 (-12.0AU (IQR

Integration of data: network analysis 
While simple linear regression analyses did not provide useful insight ( Tables S8,12,-
14), nine data clusters were delineated, comprising 91 different interactions 
between longitudinal data from clinical, protein homeostatic, inflammatory, 
mitochondrial, bioenergetic and nutritional data (Figure 4). Of these, 79 (87%) 
interactions have been observed previously in human tissue, and the remainder in 
animal tissue (Table S11), further validating of our approach. The network revealed 
the close relationship between bioenergetic impairment and reductions in both 
Rectus Femoris Cross Sectional Area and Protein/DNA ratio (Figure 4A), and between 
intramuscular inflammation and impaired anabolic signaling (Figure 4B). 
Bioenergetic impairment and fall in muscle mass appeared unrelated to the delivery 
 of phospholipids, or of saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
delivered (Figure 4C). 
 
Further results are available in the online supplement. 
 
DISCUSSION 
In this study of patients during early critical illness, we report novel data detailing 
the the relationships between skeletal muscle wasting and the inflammatory, 
hypoxic and protein homeostatic signaling together with the bioenergetic status of 
the muscle.  A network analysis has been used to describe these relationships in the 
context of clinical physiological data. Three important novel findings were observed: 
i) Decreased ATP, creatine and phosphocreatine availability are  closely and directly 
related to acute skeletal muscle wasting (protein/DNA ratio and Rectus Femoris 
Cross Sectional Area). ii) Activation of hypoxic and inflammatory signaling are closely 
and directly related to impairment of anabolic signaling pathways. iii) Changes in 
intramuscular ATP content and skeletal muscle mass are unrelated to the quantity of 
lipids delivered . 
 
Change in bioenergetic state during early critical illness 
Decreases in PGC1α, markers of mitochondrial fission (DRP-1) and mitochondrial 
DNA copy number reflect reduced mitochondrial biogenesis.  Mitochondrial complex 
concentrations did not change over the first week of critical illness, although 
mitochondrial beta-oxidation enzyme concentrations fell.  Although functional 
mitochondrial measurements could not be performed, decreases in beta-oxidation 
 and oxidative phosphorylation explain the finding that myocellular ATP content was 
lower in patients than in healthy controls on day 1, and decreased further over the 
first week.  The measured decrease in muscle ATP, along with phosphocreatine and 
creatine content was accompanied by an increase in AMP-K, implying a 
compromised bioenergetic state and potentially decreasing anabolism. Assimilating 
previously published data on muscle mass and protein homeostasis regulation1, 
network analysis confirmed the relationship between impaired bioenergetic status, 
bioenergetic sensing signal and loss in muscle mass. 
Neither muscle ATP content nor muscle mass were related to the quantity of fatty 
acids delivered as part of nutrition or sedative use. This was in keeping with both the 
measurements of lipid oxidation performed, and the increase in myocellular 
phosphocholine in a separate analysis.  These data suggest that current critical care 
nutrional management is unable to prevent development of an impaired 
bioenergetics status, which may be causal in regard to acute muscle wasting. 
Metabolo-inflammatory response during early critical illness 
The complex relationship between inflammation, anabolism and metabolism was 
demonstrated in the network analysis and may impact on both skeletal muscle mass 
and quality.  Intramuscular inflammatory mediators clustered with anabolic signaling 
proteins, suggesting a deleterious effect of inflammation. Previous work by 
Constantin et al32 demonstrated anabolic signaling transcription upregulation with 
no corresponding increase in protein expression. Inflammatory signalling  likely 
inhibits this translation of programmed anabolic restoration32 and therefore muscle 
mass maintenance and  has been demonstrated in animal models22 33. 
 Myonecrosis with an associated macrophagic infiltrate has also been reported34.  
Elevated intramuscular IL-10  as seen in these data may activate macrophages 35 and 
induce phagocytosis of myofibre debris, and represent another potential mechanism 
of switching in macrophage phenotype35. This may counteract the detrimental 
effects of the observed lipid accumulation, which may affect switching from the M1 
(pro-inflammatory) to M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophage phenotype36, impeding 
autophagy37 and recovery from myonecrosis.  In addition, IL-10 demonstrates a 
suppressive effect on the Th1 cytokine response in injured muscle i.e. decreasing the 
inflammatory effects of M1 associated effectors, such as Il-638 and TNFα 39. The final 
macrophage phenotype remains unclear but  is likely to be the result of a balance of 
these factors, which may be altered by interventions that either a) decrease 
inflammation or b) decrease lipid accumulation. 
The rise in HIF1α was unrelated to the presence of systemic hypoxia, although the 
presence of cellular dysoxia cannot be excluded.  Measuring the totality of the 
balance between tissue oxygen supply and demand in muscle beds is not technically 
possible in the clinical context.  Nor is it easy to separate the extent to which 
metabolic change is dependent or consequent to altered oxygen or substrate 
delivery.  However HIF activity can be stimulated via pro-inflammatory cytokines40, 
circulating lactate41 or insulin resistance42.  Thus the HIF1α signaling in muscle during 
critical illness appears to mirror the complex relationship between hypoxic signaling 
and inflammation seen in solid tumours23.  Regardless, this increase in HIF1α  
concentration may reflect alterations in glucose metabolism such as the Pasteur 
effect43, metabolic  reprogramming to allow GLUT-4 membrane translocation42 or 
 attempts to stimulate glycolysis43. Additonal examination of the complexity of 
glucose metabolism was beyond the scope of this manuscript. 
The rise in adiponectin could represent a homeostatic response to lipid 
accumulation and/or insulin resistance44, and increasing ghrelin concentrations may 
reflect the compromised bioenergetics state in skeletal muscle. However, 
adiponectin and ghrelin also play a role in the regulation of inflammation45 46, and 
cluster analysis suggests a close relationship with the inflammatory response. 
These data suggest that intramuscular inflammation is likely to prevent anabolic 
restoration, impedeing the effects of exercise or amino acid supplementation on 
muscle protein synthesis.  HIF1 α upregulation is associated with this inflammation 
and may modulate the metabolic response. 
Clinical relevance 
These data are the first to suggest that the lipid component of enteral and 
parenteral nutrition may be, in part, bioenergetically inert in the context of critical 
illness. This may be of substantial clinical importance, given that lipids contribute 29-
43%47 48 of the energy content in enteral, and 50% of parenteral, formulae49. These 
findings thus offer a plausible explanation for the apparent conflict between data 
from observational studies demonstrating a clinical benefit from increased nutrition 
over the entire ICU stay50  and the lack of benefit observed with early targeted 
nutrition5-7.  In early critical illness, ATP turnover may not respond to higher calorific 
feed content and therefore differ little between intervention and usual care groups 
in clinical trials, particularly when parenteral nutrition is used5 6 17.  
Likewise, a failure of ATP turnover may account for a limited response to (and thus 
the observed limited benefit from) exercise interventions9 10 12 with concomitant 
 hypoxic21 and/or inflammatory stimuli additionally impairing muscle protein 
synthesis resulting in an attenuated response to intervention.  However, as these 
adverse stimuli decrease with treatment and time, nutrition delivered may augment 
recovery. 
Altering the composition of feed delivered in critical illness to exclude the lipid 
component may, in part, address the observed bioenergetic impairment and is an 
area for further research. 
Future work 
We consider that future clinical studies should be directed towards addressing these 
three core important novel findings However, targeting a single molecule or other 
aspect of altered biology is unlikely to be successful. Interventions will likely need to 
target the whole, or multiple parts of the network (i.e. the molecular signature), in 
the same fashion perhaps as asthma51 or breast cancer52.   
From these data, we propose potential research to be targeted at: i)Skeletal muscle 
wasting as a consequence of a reduction in ATP, creatine and phosphocreatine 
availability e.g. non-invasive diagnostic techniques to measure mitochondrial 
function; development of treatments to ameliorate  mitochondrial dysfunction 
and/or skeletal muscle energy content including the use of supplemental creatine. Ii) 
Skeletal muscle anabolism which is negatively affected by hypoxia and inflammation 
e.g. targeted anti-inflammatory treatments, which may be pharmacologic, 
nutritional and exercise prescriptions; confirmation of timing for nutritional and 
exercise delivery to aid anabolic restoration. Iii) Lipid delivery which has limited 
impact of skeletal muscle energy status e.g. the use of alternative non-fat fuel 
sources and removal of fatty acid supplementation53  
 In addition, the low bioenergetic baseline of patients with pre-existing chronic 
diseases highlights the need for tailored interventions, including nutrition50, and 
stratification in trials54.  
Limitations 
We did not directly measure mitochondrial function in snap-frozen samples, due to 
limitations in the validity of this approach55 56. However, our focus was on the 
downstream effects of previously described alterations in mitochondrial function15 16 
24 and both the fall in ATP and increases in phospholipids are in keeping with the 
static measurements performed. Tissue was rapidly acquired (under 10 seconds) and 
snap-frozen allowing further confidence in these data57.  Limited tissue availability 
precluded more granular metabophenotyping, although sufficient to test the 
hypothesis. The consistent and marked declines in muscle ATP and the muscle 
creatine pool may be contributed to by muscle tissue necrosis that has been 
previously observed1. Total ghrelin was measured rather than active components 
such as acyl-ghrelin58 and may not reflect true activity. The network analysis allowed 
revelation of patterns of activity that would otherwise have been hidden by 
traditional analysis31 of a relatively small (albeit deeply phenotyped) cohort, which 
nevertheless represents the largest longitudinal serial muscle biopsy cohort in acute 
critical illness. Ideally these findings would be replicated in a second independent 
sample. Given the difficulties in performing  serial muscle biopsies in the critically ill, 
this was considered beyond the scope of the study. Our data may not be 
generailisable to all critically ill patients, as this cohort consisted of patients of high 
acuity (APACHE II score of 23.5 (95%CI21.9-25.2) who spent a minimum of 7 days in 
critical care. A validation cohort of lesser acuity may offer differing results. The 
 patient cohort is heterogeneous in many regards, as is typical of the critically ill. 
However we, and others, have demonstrated that similar of patterns exist in 
critically ill patients with respect to acute muscle wasting in terms of muscle mass1 59 
and function54 59 60, molecular biology1 and in this current application, metabolism, 
despite heterogeneity in presenting disease. Moreover, the statistical approach used 
would reveal such heterogeneity if it existed. These data strongly support the 
presence of metabolic homogeneity. Of clinical importance, the mechanisms 
identified were present across a mixed ICU population. It is, of course, possible that 
the balance of such elements may vary amongst individual patients (e.g. with 
differing levels of inflammation, hypoxaemia, corticosteroid and vasopressor agent 
exposure). 
 Only 5.3% of data entered into the network analysis was missing, which is within 
acceptable missing data threshold61.The convergence of data from separate 
laboratories and techniques also increases confidence in our conclusions. The first 
day of ICU admission does not necessarily reflect the first day of critical illness. 
Whilst unable to quantify physiological derangement prior to admission, the median 
time from hospital to ICU admission was only 24 hours. In addition 16/34 patients 
suffered major trauma or an intracranial bleed and were not exposed to antecedent 
decline. Due to the observational nature of our study, causal links in terms of 
mechanism cannot be made. While longitudinal studies remain the focus of this 
work, we acknowledge the need for future work accounting for alterations in 
inflammation and hypoxia signaling relative to healthy controls. 
All control muscle ATP, phosphocreatine and free creatine concentrations represent 
unpublished, archived, historical data that were generated prior to the analysis 
 performed on muscle from critically ill patients. However, all measurements were 
standardized as they were performed in the same laboratory, using the same 
techniques by the same research group. Further control muscle ATP, creatine and 
phospocreatine contents are noted to be within normal range25. 
Conclusions 
These data have shown that there is a relationship between an impaired 
bioenergetic status and acute muscle wasting during early critical illness.  This 
indeed may explain the reduced clinical effectiveness of the currently employed 
nutritional supplementation and exercise therapy interventions used in the ICU. 
Dysregulated lipid oxidation and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis contribute to 
this compromised skeletal muscle bioenergetic status.  In addition, intramuscular 
inflammation was associated with impaired anabolic recovery with lipid delivery 
during early critical illness observed as bioenergetically inert. Future clinical work will 
need to focus on these key areas to develop strategies to ameliorate acute acute 
skeletal muscle wasting during early critical illness.
