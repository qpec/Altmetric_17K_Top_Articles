Dopamine-dependent prefrontal reactivations
explain long-term benefit of fear extinction
A.M.V. Gerlicher1,2,4, O. Tüscher2,3 & R. Kalisch1,2
Fear extinction does not prevent post-traumatic stress or have long-term therapeutic benefits
in fear-related disorders unless extinction memories are easily retrieved at later encounters
with the once-threatening stimulus. Previous research in rodents has pointed towards a role
for spontaneous prefrontal activity occurring after extinction learning in stabilizing and
consolidating extinction memories. In other memory domains spontaneous post-learning
activity has been linked to dopamine. Here, we show that a neural activation pattern —
evoked in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) by the unexpected omission of the
feared outcome during extinction learning — spontaneously reappears during postextinction
rest. The number of spontaneous vmPFC pattern reactivations predicts extinction memory
retrieval and vmPFC activation at test 24 h later. Critically, pharmacologically enhancing
dopaminergic activity during extinction consolidation amplifies spontaneous vmPFC reacti-
vations and correspondingly improves extinction memory retrieval at test. Hence, a spon-
taneous dopamine-dependent memory consolidation-based mechanism may underlie the
long-term behavioral effects of fear extinction.

 F
ear extinction is believed to protect against the development
of stress-related pathology after trauma1. Furthermore,
exposure interventions based on the principles of extinction
learning are a cornerstone of cognitive-behavioral therapy of
anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder2. During fear
extinction, conditioned fear responses (CRs) are reduced through
repeated exposure to the fear-inducing stimulus (conditioned
stimulus, CS) in the absence of the aversive outcome (uncondi-
tioned stimulus, US) with which it had previously been paired.
Extinction learning establishes a “CS–noUS” association or
extinction memory that needs to be retrieved at later confronta-
tions with the CS in order to inhibit the expression of the original
“CS–US” association or fear memory and prevent the return of
CRs3. An important problem that plagues extinction research is
that the success of extinction learning is neither a strong nor
reliable predictor of the long-term retrieval of the extinction
memory4,5. Even complete abolishment of CRs in an extinction
session does not guarantee the absence of CRs at later test.
Conversely, no or incomplete extinction may still protect against
the return of CRs4,5. We here suggest that spontaneous, stimulus-
independent neural consolidation processes occurring in the
hours or days after learning6 can help to explain whether
extinction memories are successfully retrieved and prevent the
return of fear in the long-term.
There is increasing evidence that neural consolidation pro-
cesses may not simply be a deterministic prolongation of
encoding processes but may, instead, make an independent
contribution to memory formation7. In rodents, extinction
memory consolidation depends on the infralimbic part of the
medial prefrontal cortex (IL)8–10. The IL exhibits neural firing
activity in the form of spontaneous gamma-frequency bursts in
the hours after extinction8. The number of IL bursts predicts
extinction memory retrieval at test 24 h later, such that animals
with more bursts during consolidation show smaller CRs at test8.
IL bursts have also been observed in response to CS presentations
during extinction learning11, raising the possibility that stimulus-
evoked neural activity patterns established during extinction
learning may be reactivated in a stimulus-independent fashion
after learning. The first aim of the study was, thus, to examine
whether spontaneous reactivations of extinction-related activity
patterns in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (the
human homolog of the IL12) contribute to human extinction
consolidation and can predict the long-term expression of fear.
Furthermore, extinction memory consolidation depends on
dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex. Blocking dopa-
mine receptors before or after extinction in the IL impairs
extinction consolidation and leads to a return of CRs13,14, while
increasing dopaminergic receptor activity during or after extinc-
tion leads to improved extinction memory retrieval15–18. Two
studies suggest that extinction memory consolidation can also be
enhanced in humans by systemic postextinction administration of
the dopamine precursor levodopa17,19. Interestingly, dopamine
has been shown to amplify spontaneous burst firing in the pre-
frontal cortex in rodents20. In addition, dopamine was shown to
increase the reactivation of learning-related neural activity during
consolidation in the domain of spatial memory21. Based on these
findings, the second aim of the study was to test whether a
postextinction enhancement of dopaminergic activity increases
vmPFC reactivations of extinction-related activity patterns after
learning and thereby improves extinction memory retrieval.
We tested these hypotheses in n = 40 male human participants
(Supplementary Table 1) in a functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) experiment, with fear conditioning on day 1,
extinction training immediately followed by the oral adminis-
tration of either placebo or 150/37, 5 mg levodopa/benserazide
(L-DOPA) on day 2, and retrieval test on day 3 (Fig. 1). During
conditioning, one of two geometric symbols (CS+) was paired
with a painful stimulation (US) in 50% of trials, while the other
symbol (CS−) was never paired with the US. During extinction
and test, both symbols were presented in the absence of the US.
During all experimental phases, we recorded skin conductance
responses (SCRs) to both CSs as index of the CR. In addition, US-
expectancy ratings to both CSs were assessed before and after
each experimental phase to assess contingency awareness (Sup-
plementary
Fig.
1).
In
order
to
capture
spontaneous
consolidation-related neural activity, resting-state fMRI scans
were collected 10, 45, and 90 min after the end of the extinction
session (Fig. 1a).
Our results show that the number of postextinction reactiva-
tions of an extinction learning-related vmPFC pattern (day 2)
predicts extinction memory retrieval at test (day 3). As expected,
postextinction administration of L-DOPA enhances extinction
memory retrieval and reduces the expression of fear at test on day
3. Critically, L-DOPA also increases the number of vmPFC pat-
tern reactivations, and this effect mediates the effect of L-DOPA
on extinction memory retrieval. These results provide the first
evidence for a critical role of dopamine-dependent vmPFC
activity pattern reactivations in the consolidation of human
extinction memories. Lastly, we show that spontaneous vmPFC
pattern reactivations can explain long-term extinction memory
retrieval above and beyond a marker of extinction learning
success.
Results
Postextinction
L-DOPA administration enhances extinction
memory retrieval. On day 1, CRs were successfully acquired, as
indicated by greater SCRs to the CS+ than to the CS− in both
groups (repeated-measures ANOVA: stimulus: F1,35 = 57.95,
P < .001, partial η2 = 0.62, stimulus × group: P = 0.67; n = 37
participants with sufficient SCR data quality, see Methods). On
day 2, CRs were successfully retrieved at the beginning of
extinction in both groups (stimulus: F1,34 = 29.87, P < .001, partial
η2 = 0.47; stimulus × group: P = 0.36; n = 36). At the end of
extinction learning, there was still a significant CS+ > CS− dif-
ference on SCRs that did, however, not differ between groups
(stimulus: F1,34 = 14.49, P < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.30; stimulus ×
group:
P = 0.54;
n = 36).
As
predicted,
the
postextinction
administration of L-DOPA compared to placebo (see Fig. 1a)
enhanced extinction memory retrieval and reduced the expres-
sion of fear at test on day 3 (stimulus: F1,33 = 44.61, P < .001,
partial η2 = 0.58, stimulus × group: F1,33 = 6.58, P = 0.02, partial
η2 = 0.17; n = 35; Fig. 1b). Specifically, L-DOPA-treated partici-
pants showed significantly smaller SCRs to the formerly rein-
forced CS+ than placebo-treated participants (two-sample t test:
T33 = −2.25, P = 0.03, Cohen’s d = 0.74; n = 35; Fig. 1b). Thus,
in line with previous findings17,18, a postextinction administra-
tion of L-DOPA compared to placebo (see Fig. 1a) enhanced
extinction memory retrieval and reduced the long-term expres-
sion of conditioned fear.
Reactivations of a CS+ offset-related vmPFC pattern predict
extinction memory retrieval. Next, we tested the first hypothesis
of whether spontaneous reactivations of extinction learning-
related neural activity in the time after extinction learning predict
extinction memory retrieval. Due to its indispensable role in
extinction memory consolidation8–10, we focused our analyses on
the vmPFC and specifically on the possible reactivation of an
extinction learning-related vmPFC activity pattern during the
postlearning resting-state scans (R in Fig. 1a). We first deter-
mined the spatial distribution of fMRI activity within the vmPFC

 at the critical time point for learning in the extinction session: the
omission of the US at CS+ offset in early extinction trials.
Early in the extinction session, US omission is unexpected to
the participants and elicits a prediction error. Prediction errors
drive the correction of the US prediction associated with the CS
and induce extinction learning22. To capture this time point, we
extracted the average multivoxel vmPFC activity pattern evoked
by the first five offsets of the CS+ (the CS that had previously
been paired with the US during conditioning) during extinction.
We then correlated each participant’s CS+ offset-related vmPFC
pattern with his individual vmPFC pattern from each imaging
time point (volume) during the pre- and postextinction resting-
state scans (Fig. 1a). As in ref.
23, the individual Pearson
correlation values for each volume were z-transformed, using the
mean and standard deviation of correlations from the pre-
extinction scan as a baseline reference, to then threshold them at
a cut-off of Z = 2 (~P = 0.05)23. On this basis, the suprathreshold
correlations in the postextinction scans depicted in Fig. 2a can be
considered to reflect potential spontaneous reactivations of the
CS+ offset-related vmPFC activity pattern. Pattern reactivations
in the vmPFC were approximately uniformly distributed over the
time courses of each postextinction resting-state scan (Fig. 2a),
and only a minority of participants did not exhibit any potential
reactivation in a given resting-state scan (10 min: n = 1, 45 min:
n = 3, 90 min: n = 1).
Critically, the number of potential vmPFC pattern reactivations
during the 45-min postextinction scan negatively predicted CRs
at test on day 3 (multiple linear regression: β45 min = −0.13, SE =
0.03, T30 = −4.05, P = 0.0003; n = 35; Fig. 2b; for control
analyses, see Supplementary Figs. 2, 3). That is, more CS+
offset-related vmPFC reactivations were associated with improved
extinction memory retrieval (i.e., reduced CRs) at test. Reactiva-
tions during the scans 10 or 90 min after extinction did

Fig. 1 Experimental design and skin conductance responses. a Participants underwent a 3-day fMRI study with fear conditioning on day 1, extinction and
subsequent placebo or L-DOPA administration on day 2 and test on day 3. During fear conditioning one of two geometric symbols (CS+) was reinforced
with a painful electrical stimulation, while the other symbol (CS−) was never reinforced. Postextinction placebo or L-DOPA administration was randomized
and double-blinded (placebo: n = 20, L-DOPA n = 20, all male, for group characteristics, see Supplementary Table 1). Resting-state fMRI scans (R) were
acquired before and after fear conditioning, before and 10, 45, and 90 min after extinction, and before test. b During all experimental phases, we assessed
conditioned responses (CRs) as skin conductance responses (SCRs) to CS+ and CS−. Upper panel depicts mean SCR to CS+ and CS− for placebo-, lower
panel for L-DOPA-treated participants. The groups differed significantly on mean SCRs across the test phase on day 3 (marked by yellow line) due to
significantly smaller mean SCRs to the CS+ in L-DOPA compared to placebo-treated participants. Note, that the group difference stemmed from
significantly smaller CS+ evoked SCRs averaged across the whole test phase, but the speed of re-extinction did not differ significantly between drug groups

 The administration of L-DOPA did not affect the predictive
relationship between number of CS+ offset-related vmPFC
reactivations and CRs at test, but comparable relationships
between number of vmPFC reactivations and CRs at test were
found in each group (multiple linear regression: interaction
reactivations × group, P = 0.99; simple slope analysis placebo:
β = −0.09, P = 0.04,
L-DOPA: β = −0.09, P = 0.07; n = 35;
Fig. 2b).
In addition, number of reactivations 45 min after extinction
also predicted greater recruitment of the vmPFC during test on
day 3, as determined in a canonical mass-univariate fMRI analysis
(Fig. 2c). Activity in the vmPFC at test is an established neural
correlate of extinction memory retrieval24,25. In line with this
interpretation,
vmPFC
activity
at
test
showed
a
negative
relationship to CRs at test in the present data, with greater
vmPFC activity being associated with smaller differential CRs at
test (Fig. 2d).
The finding that postextinction reactivations of the unexpected
US omission pattern predict CRs at test was specific to resting-
state activity in the vmPFC as opposed to all control regions
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Importantly, the relationship was also
specific to the pattern elicited by the unexpected US omission at
early CS+ offset, as opposed to the expected US omission at early
CS− offset (Supplementary Fig. 5a), the US omissions at CS+
offset during later phases of extinction (middle and last five trials;
Supplementary Fig. 5b, c) at which the omission of the US was
not surprising to the participant anymore, or the CS+ onset early,
middle or late during extinction (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Even

 though the relationship was specific to the pattern elicited by the
unexpected US omission at CS+ offset early during extinction,
the exact number of trials used for estimating the early CS+
offset-related vmPFC activity pattern (here: first five CS+ offsets)
was not critical for the results (Supplementary Figure 6). Lastly,
the results are not dependent on cleaning or not-cleaning the
resting-state BOLD activity time courses from nuisance signals
(i.e., cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and head motion) before
identifying potential vmPFC reactivations (Supplementary Fig-
ure 7). Together, these findings suggest that spontaneous
reactivations of a CS+ offset-related vmPFC activity pattern in
the vmPFC after learning contribute to the consolidation of
extinction memories and promote their later retrieval.
The effect of L-DOPA on extinction memory retrieval can be
explained by its effect on vmPFC reactivations. Next, we turned
to the second hypothesis concerning the potential role of dopa-
mine in spontaneous pattern reactivations during consolidation
and asked whether L-DOPA exerts its consolidation-enhancing
effect by amplifying the frequency of postextinction vmPFC
reactivations. Indeed, postextinction
L-DOPA administration
significantly increased the number of potential CS+ offset-related
vmPFC pattern reactivations (time × group: F3,114 = 3.51, P =
0.02, partial η2 = 0.09; n = 40), particularly 45 min after extinc-
tion and there was still a near-significant trend 90 min after
extinction (post hoc two-sample t test; pre: P = 0.39; post: 10 min:
P = 0.09; 45 min: T38 = −3.05, P = 0.004, Cohen’s d = 0.97; 90
min: T38 = −1.95, P = 0.06, Cohen’s d = 0.62; n = 40; Fig. 2e).
This timing is consistent with the reported peak plasma levels of
dopamine after oral L-DOPA intake26.
This result cannot be explained by a potential diffuse effect of
L-DOPA on the detection rate of any kind of potential
reactivations, as
L-DOPA did not affect reactivations of any
control pattern such as the CS− offset-related patterns (Fig. 2f) or
CS+ offset-related patterns elicited later during extinction
learning (time × group: all Ps > 0.25). Intriguingly, the number
of reactivations of the CS+ offset-related vmPFC pattern at 45
min postextinction mediated the effect of L-DOPA on CRs at test
(Fig. 2g; mediation analysis—indirect mediator effect: β = −0.09,
95% CI: −0.13 to −0.02, P = 0.007; bootstrapping procedure with
10,000 simulations; n = 35). That is, L-DOPA affected fear at test
by increasing the number of vmPFC reactivations during
extinction memory consolidation.
Spontaneous
postextinction
vmPFC
reactivations
explain
extinction memory retrieval independent of extinction learn-
ing success. Lastly, we asked whether potential CS+ offset-related
vmPFC pattern reactivations explain extinction memory retrieval
over and above interindividual differences in extinction learning
itself, using hierarchical multiple linear regression. The best
behavioral predictor of extinction retrieval we could identify in
our extinction learning data (Supplementary Fig. 8) was the dif-
ferential CR at the end of extinction learning (SCR CS+ > CS−,
last three trials, β = 0.21, SE = 0.10, T30 = 2.19, P = 0.04), which
we henceforth used as an index for extinction success. The first
model set up to predict CRs at test on day 3 corrected for drug
group
(R2 = 0.17,
F1,33 = 6.58,
P = 0.02;
n = 33).
Including
extinction success into the model significantly improved the
prediction (ΔR2 = 0.11, ΔF1,30 = 5.52, P = 0.03). In the sub-
sequent analysis step, we further included potential CS+ offset-
related vmPFC reactivations. The combined model explained 40%
of the variance (F3,29 = 6.41, P = 0.002) and predicted CRs at test
significantly better than extinction success and drug group on
their own (ΔR2 = 0.11, ΔF1,29 = 5.49, P = 0.03). These results
confirm that vmPFC reactivations occurring spontaneously after
extinction
learning
make
an
independent
contribution
to
explaining long-term extinction memory retrieval, when con-
trolling for interindividual differences in extinction learning.
Discussion
In summary, our study shows that spontaneous postextinction
reactivations of an activity pattern evoked in the vmPFC by the
unexpected omission of the US during extinction learning (day 2)
predict long-term extinction memory retrieval (day 3), as assessed
by differential SCRs. The relationship between spontaneous CS+
offset-related postextinction reactivations and extinction memory
retrieval at test was specific to the vmPFC and could not be
detected in any other region of interest (ROI). Furthermore, a
higher number of spontaneous vmPFC reactivations was also
predictive of greater vmPFC activity at test. In line with previous
studies in rodents and humans24,25,27,28, greater vmPFC activity
at test was in turn associated with improved extinction memory
retrieval. In the present study, we further manipulated extinction
consolidation using
L-DOPA. In line with previous work in
rodents17,18 and humans17, we observed that a postextinction L-
DOPA administration enhanced extinction memory retrieval
relative to placebo administration. Our findings extend beyond

resting-state scans on day 2 (repeated-measures ANOVA: time × group: P = 0.63, group: P = 0.77; n = 40). g The postextinction administration of L-
DOPA had a significant positive effect on number of potential CS+ offset-related vmPFC reactivations (path a: ß = 0.97, SE = 0.30, T33 = 3.23, P = 0.003;
n = 35). The number of potential CS+ offset-related vmPFC reactivations 45 min after extinction was significantly negatively related to smaller differential
CRs at test on day 3 (path b: β = −0.10, SE = 0.03, T33 = −4.26, P = 0.0002; n = 35). After inclusion of number of potential CS+ offset-related vmPFC
reactivations into the latter model, the significant effect of drug on CRs at test (path c: ß = −0.15, SE = 0.06, T33 = −2.57, P = 0.02; n = 35) decreased
(path c’: β = −0.06, SE = 0.06, T32 = −0.98, P = 0.33; n = 35), indicating that the effect of L-DOPA on CRs at test on day 3 was significantly mediated

 those reported to date by showing that the effect of L-DOPA on
extinction memory retrieval was mediated by the
L-DOPA-
induced increase in spontaneous postextinction vmPFC reacti-
vations. Thus, pharmacologically elevated dopamine release
enhanced extinction consolidation by amplifying spontaneous
vmPFC reactivations after learning. This is the first evidence in
the human memory literature for a dopamine-dependent ampli-
fication of neural pattern reactivations during memory con-
solidation, as detected in fMRI. Furthermore, these results
corroborate that spontaneous postextinction vmPFC reactivations
make
an

to
extinction
memory
consolidation.
Fear extinction promotes resilience against the development
of post-traumatic stress orders1 and fear extinction principles
are employed during cognitive-behavioral therapy in order to
reduce pathological fears5. However, in order to prevent the
return of fear, the extinction memory has to successfully be
retrieved at later confrontations with the CS. Our results show
that the long-term retrieval of extinction memories can be
explained by interindividual differences in spontaneous post-
extinction reactivations in the vmPFC. The contribution of
spontaneous postlearning reactivations to memory consolida-
tion has intensively been studied in hippocampus-dependent
spatial memories29. However, in rodents, postlearning reacti-
vations of learning-related activity patterns are also observed in
the prefrontal cortex, during sleep as well as awake rest30–33.
Among others, such prefrontal reactivations were shown to
contribute to the memory consolidation of new rules acquired
in a rule-shift task30. Spontaneous activity in the infralimbic
cortex after extinction learning is indispensable for extinction
memory consolidation in rodents: when inhibiting NMDA
receptor activity in the vmPFC after extinction learning, ani-
mals exhibit impaired extinction memory retrieval at test 24 h
later8,9. Particularly, the number of spontaneous postextinction
neuronal bursts in the vmPFC, also observed during extinc-
tion11, predicts later extinction memory retrieval in rodents8.
Motivated by these findings we focused our analyses on the
human vmPFC and provide the first evidence that spontaneous
postextinction
reactivations
of
a
learning-related
vmPFC
activity pattern contribute to human extinction memory con-
solidation
and can
explain
interindividual differences
in
extinction memory retrieval and vmPFC activity at test.
Our results show that specifically reactivations of the vmPFC
activity pattern elicited at the time of the unexpected omission
of the US at CS+ offset early in extinction predict extinction
memory retrieval. Why may this specific vmPFC pattern be
important for extinction memory retrieval? The unexpected
omission of the aversive US early in extinction may elicit a
surprise, relief or prediction error (“outcome better than
expected”) signal. It is conceivable that upon such a signal the
vmPFC acquires and updates a representation of the expected
value of the new “CS–noUS” association, in line with the role of
the vmPFC in expected value representation34. A limitation of
our study is that we did not model the prediction error signal
explicitly (due to the limited reliability of model parameters
estimated based on noisy trial-by-trial SCR). Thus, future work
is necessary to elucidate the contribution of prediction error
signals to the formation of the CS+ offset-related vmPFC
activity pattern, whose postlearning reactivation supports
extinction memory consolidation.
Previous research in humans has revealed that stimulus-
specific postlearning reactivations can be identified in the
entorhinal and retrosplenial cortices23, the occipito-temporal
cortex35,36 and the hippocampus7 using multivoxel pattern ana-
lyses in fMRI. Across studies, stimulus-specific postlearning fMRI
pattern
reactivations
were
associated
with
later
memory
performance. Our results extend these findings by providing the
first evidence for a critical role of dopamine in fMRI pattern
reactivations during human memory consolidation. That is, when
enhancing extinction memory consolidation pharmacologically
by administering the dopamine precursor L-DOPA after learning,
we observed an increase in vmPFC reactivations. The L-DOPA
induced increase in vmPFC reactivations explained the effect of L-
DOPA on CRs at test. Importantly, this finding cannot be
explained by an unspecific effect of L-DOPA on detecting any
kind of reactivation, as L-DOPA did not affect the number of
reactivations of any other control pattern. Our findings are in line
with previous research in rodents showing that optogenetic sti-
mulation of dopaminergic projections to the hippocampus during
spatial learning amplifies postlearning hippocampal reactivations
and results in improved memory performance21. Similarly,
learning in a reward-context, presumably increasing dopami-
nergic activation during learning, enhanced fMRI pattern reac-
tivation in humans7. Here, we show that also postlearning
pharmacological enhancement of dopamine amplifies memory
reactivations. Such an amplification of postlearning reactivations
is suggested to stabilize synaptic connections37 and thereby,
eventually, result in better memory performance.
The relationship between spontaneous postextinction CS+ offset-
related pattern reactivations and extinction memory retrieval was
limited to the vmPFC. Control regions, among them the hippo-
campus, did not show any relation between CS+ offset-related
pattern reactivations and later extinction memory retrieval. We can,
however, not exclude that reactivations of other patterns than the
CS+ offset elicited pattern contribute to extinction memory con-
solidation in these regions. In light of the reported synchronization
of prefrontal activity pattern reactivations and hippocampal sharp
wave ripples in rodents30,38, future studies may also investigate
whether the here observed CS+ offset-related vmPFC reactivations
are concerted with hippocampal ripple activity.
An important question raised by our results is why vmPFC
reactivations specifically 45 min after extinction learning pre-
dicted CRs at test, whereas the effect was weaker and non-
significant 10 and 90 min after extinction learning. Studies on
molecular cascades contributing to synaptic plasticity have shown
that different molecular signaling cascades follow different time
courses after learning39, i.e., the disruption of a certain molecular
signal does only lead to a disruption in memory consolidation
when applied in a sensitive time window. Disruptions preceding
or succeeding this signal pathway’s specific time window do not
affect memory consolidation and performance. Given this tem-
poral specificity on the molecular level, it is possible that also
large-scale neural activity pattern reactivations may only be
functionally relevant during a specific time window after learning.
However, the exact time course of their contribution to memory
consolidation has not been investigated yet.
In the present study, we identified spontaneous postextinction
reactivations of an extinction learning-related neural pattern in
the vmPFC as a basal mechanism of human extinction memory
consolidation. By experimentally manipulating dopaminergic
activity after learning and observing increases in spontaneous
vmPFC reactivation frequency associated with improved extinc-
tion memory retrieval, the present study further provides the first
evidence for a critical role of dopamine in human memory
reactivations. These results open up a wide field of investigation
concerning the neurophysiological basis of extinction memory
consolidation and its enhancement with pharmacological, beha-
vioral or neurostimulation tools.
Methods
Participants. In total, we recruited 45 male participants. Five participants had to be
excluded prior to data analysis due to claustrophobia, leading to an early

 termination of the experiment on day 1 (n = 3), noncompliance with the
instructions (n = 1) and a congenital pendular nystagmus (n = 1). In total, 40
participants (age range: 26–36 years, mean ± SD: 28.1 ± 2.7) completed the study.
We restricted recruitment to male participants as the estrous cycle interacts with
extinction memory consolidation40 and dopamine can have opposing effects on
extinction depending on estrous cycle phase41. A board-certified physician
screened participants for contraindications of L-DOPA intake, current physiolo-
gical, neurological, or psychiatric disorders, excessive consumption of nicotine (>10
cigarettes/day), alcohol (>15 glasses of beer/wine per week) or cannabis (>1 joint/
month), participation in other pharmacological studies, tinnitus (as contra-
indication for startle probe exposure). Drug abuse was assessed via urine test (M-
10/3DT; Diagnostik Nord, Schwerin, Germany). During the screening session we
also tested whether participants showed normal skin conductance responding. To
this aim, we attached two electrodes of the eSense Skin response device (Mindfield®
Biosystems Ltd., Berlin, Germany) to the medial phalanges of the first and the third
finger. Participants were then asked to take several deep breaths. In addition, the
physician clapped his hands without announcement inducing a light acoustic
startle response. Both deep breathing and acoustic startle usually result in a
deflection of the skin conductance, not seen in skin conductance nonresponding
individuals. None of the participants screened for the present study had to be
excluded according to these criteria. The experiment was approved by the local
ethics committee (Ethikkommission der Landesärztekammer, Rhineland-Palati-
nate, Germany) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Drug treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to the L-DOPA or placebo
group, with the restriction that groups were matched on ASI42 and STAI-T43 ques-
tionnaire scores (for comparisons of placebo and L-DOPA group on questionnaire
scores, see Supplementary Table 1). Participants were either administered 150/37,
5 mg levodopa-benserazide (Levodopa-Benserazid-ratiopharm®, Germany; for dosage
see refs. 17,19) or an identically looking capsule filled with mannitol and aerosol
(i.e., placebo). Drug administration was double-blind. Drugs were prepared and
provided by the pharmacy of the University Medical Center Mainz. Participants were
asked to refrain from eating, consuming caffeinated drinks, and smoking 2 h prior to
drug intake. The short half-life of L-DOPA (~90 min)26 allowed us to test the effect of
L-DOPA on memory consolidation specifically, without risking potential confounding
effects of L-DOPA at test 24 h after drug intake.
Stimuli. Two black geometric symbols presented in the center of a computer screen
served as CS+ and CS− and were super-imposed on background pictures of either
a kitchen or a living room, which served as contexts A and B. Assignment of
symbols to CS+/CS− and rooms to contexts A/B was counter-balanced between
participants and groups. In order to diminish the risk of low visual feature dif-
ferences between stimuli potentially confounding fMRI BOLD multivoxel patterns,
we used a square and a rhombus (square turned by 90°) as CSs and adjusted mean
contrast and luminance between pictures using the SHINE toolbox44. In all
experiments, a painful electrical stimulation consisting of three square-wave pulses
of 2 ms (50 ms interstimulus interval) was employed as US. Pain stimuli were
generated by a DS7A electrical stimulator (Digitimer, Weybridge) and delivered on
the right dorsal hand through a surface electrode with platinum pin (Specialty
Developments, Bexley, UK).
Experimental procedure. Day 1—Conditioning: Upon arrival participants com-
pleted questionnaires on trait and state anxiety (STAIT-T/S)43, anxiety sensitivity
(ASI-3)42 and demographic data. Electrodes were attached and participants were
placed in the MRI scanner. A resting-state scan was conducted before the start of the
experiment (Fig. 1a). Subsequently, US-intensity was calibrated to a level rated as
“maximally painful, but still tolerable”. Familiarization consisted of two CS pre-
sentations in both contexts and a practical training of US-expectancy ratings. We
instructed participants that the experiment was distributed across 3 days, that one
symbol would never be followed by an electrical stimulation, and that their task was to
find out what rule applied to the other symbol. Each day, the paradigm started with
US-expectancy ratings for each CS (Supplementary Figure 1). Subsequently, the
context picture was on screen for 5 s before the first CS was presented. The context
remained on the screen continuously throughout the experiment. CSs were presented
for 4.5 s. US delivery terminated with CS presentation. Intertrial intervals lasted 17,
18, or 19 s (mean of 18.5 s). Trial order was randomized in such a way that not more
than two trials of the same type (i.e., CS +, CS−) succeeded each other. During
conditioning in context A participants were presented with ten CS+ and ten CS−
trials, and five out of ten CS+ presentations (i.e., 50%) were reinforced with a pain
stimulus. After conditioning, participants again rated their US-expectancy. Another
resting-state scan was conducted after the conditioning session. Subsequently, elec-
trodes were detached and participants filled out a contingency questionnaire. The
total duration of the session amounted to 1.5 h on day 1.
Day 2—Extinction: The extinction session took place approximately 24 h (±2 h)
after conditioning. Participants filled out the STAI-S. Before the start of the
extinction session electrodes were attached and one resting-state scan was collected.
We did not recalibrate the US, but informed participants that their individual US
strength from day 1 would be applied again and that the experiment would
continue. During the extinction session 15 CS+/CS− trials were presented in
context B. Subsequently, electrodes were detached and participants were
administered either a placebo or a L-DOPA pill. Directly after pill intake (~10 min)
and 45 and 90 min after pill intake, we conducted one resting-state scan. During
breaks participants remained under observation and were provided with
magazines. After the last resting-state scan, participants filled out a side-effects
questionnaire and the STAI-S. Total session duration amounted to 2.5 h.
Day 3—Test: Approximately 24 h (±2 h) later, participants filled out the side-
effects questionnaire and the STAI-S again. After electrode attachment and a resting-
state scan, participants were again only instructed that their US strength from day 1
would be applied and that the experiment would continue. During test ten CS+/10
CS− were presented in context B. Total session duration amounted to 1 h.
Resting-state scans. We collected 8 min blocks of resting-state fMRI data before
and after fear conditioning (day 1), before extinction learning, ~10, 45, and 90 min
after extinction learning and drug administration (day 2), and before the test (day 3).
During resting-state scans participants were instructed to remain awake, to keep their
eyes open and fixate a black cross presented in the center of a gray screen, to let their
mind wander freely and to avoid repetitive mental activity45. Compliance with the
instruction to remain awake was monitored using video recordings of the left eye.
Skin conductance responses (SCRs). As in previous work from our laboratory17,19,
differential SCRs to CS+ vs. CS− were used as outcome measures. Electrodermal
activity was recorded from the thenar and hypothenar of the nondominant hand using
self-adhesive Ag/AgACl electrodes (EL-509, BIOPAC® Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA)
filled with an isotonic electrolyte medium and the Biopac MP150 with EDA100C
device. The raw signal was amplified and low-pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of
1 Hz. Using a custom made analysis script, we manually scored the first local mini-
mum in the skin conductance time course in a window from 900 to 4000 ms after CS
onset as response onset. The following local maximum was scored as response peak
and SCRs as peak-to-onset difference. Importantly, the experimenter scoring the data
was blinded to the stimulus type (CS+/CS−) of each SCR and the group belong-
ingness (placebo/L-DOPA) of each participant. Responses smaller than 0.02 μs were
scored as zero and remained in the analysis. If more than 75% of trials had to be
scored as zero, data of that subject/day was considered invalid. This applied to n = 3/4/
5 (day 1/day 2/day 3) participants. For statistical analysis of each day’s SCR data we
included all available data, i.e., n = 37/36/35 on day 1/day 2/day 3, respectively. To
correct for interindividual variance, data were log-transformed (+1) and range-
corrected46 within each subject and day.
US-expectancy ratings. Before the start and after the end of each experimental
phase participants were asked to indicate their expectancy to receive an US for each
CS within a 15 s response time window by moving a cursor on a visual analog scale
from 0 (= no expectation) to 100 (= very high expectation) by pressing one button.
They were asked to confirm their rating with a second button. Button presses were
recorded using an MRI compatible response box (LUMItouch, Photon Control
Inc., Baxter, Canada). Despite two practice rating trials before the start of the
experiment some participants did not confirm their response within the 15 s
response time window. Thus, their data were not included into the statistical
analysis, resulting in n = 35/36/38 on day 1/day 2/day 3 rating data sets for sta-
tistical analysis, respectively.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed in R (https://www.r-
project.org/). For statistical analysis of SCR data, we conducted repeated-measures
ANOVA with stimulus (CS+/CS−) as within-subject, and group (L-DOPA/pla-
cebo) as between-subject factor (R package “car” implementing Type-III Sums of
Squares). As single-trial SCRs can easily be affected by factors other than the
stimulus-evoked response (e.g., concurrent breathing and a stimulus unrelated
movement), we averaged SCRs across several trials to achieve a more reliable
measure of the actual stimulus-evoked SCRs. In order to harmonize measures
across a series of experiments on the effect of L-DOPA on extinction memory
consolidation with varying trial numbers (Gerlicher et al., in preparation), we
standardized the operationalization of fear acquisition, fear memory recall, fear at
the end of extinction, and extinction memory retrieval a priori across studies.
Namely, we operationalized initial fear acquisition as SCRs to CSs averaged across
the last 20% of trials on day 1 (here: last two trials), fear memory recall as SCRs to
CSs averaged across the first 20% of trials on day 2 (here: first three trials), and fear
at the end of extinction as SCRs to CSs averaged across the last 20% of trials (here:
last three trials) on day 2. Note, that instead employing the first five and last five
trials during extinction, as in the fMRI analysis, does not change the results
(Supplementary Table 2). As in previous studies17,19, the effect of L-DOPA on
extinction memory retrieval was tested on SCRs to CS+ and CS−, averaged across
the whole test phase on day 3 (i.e., all ten trials). For statistical analysis of US-
expectancy rating data, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVA with stimulus
(CS+/CS−) as within-, and group (L-DOPA/placebo) as between-subject factor on
all pre- and postexperiment US-expectancy ratings. Results were considered sig-
nificant when below a threshold of P = 0.05 (two-sided tests).

Trio 3 Tesla MRI System using a 32-channel head-coil. Resting-state and task data

 for each experimental phase were recorded using gradient echo, echo planar
imaging (EPI) with a multiband sequence covering the whole brain (TR: 1000 ms,
TE: 29 ms, multiband acceleration factor: 4, voxel size: 2.5 mm isotropic, flip angle
56°, field of view: 210 mm; ref. 47). A high-resolution T1-weighted image was
acquired for anatomical visualization and normalization of the EPI data (TR: 1900
ms, TE: 2540 ms, voxel size: 0.8 mm isotropic, flip angle 9°, field of view: 260 mm).
Furthermore, T2-weighted images were collected for preventative neuroradiological
diagnostics conducted for all participants (39 slices, TR: 6100 ms, TE: 79 ms, voxel
size: 3 mm isotropic, flip angle: 120°). Lastly, we also collected multidimensional
diffusion weighted tensor images from each participant (72 slices, voxel size: 2 mm
isotropic, TR: 9100 ms, TE: 85 ms, number of directions: 64, diffusion weights: 2,
b value 1: 0 s/mm2, b value 2: 1000 s/mm2; data not shown).
Preprocessing of fMRI data. fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using
statistical parametric mapping (SPM12, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging,
London, UK, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/) running on Matlab 2015b (Math-
Works®, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). The first five volumes of each scan were
discarded due to equilibrium effects. Preprocessing included realignment and co-
registration of functional images to the T1-weighted anatomical image. Subse-
quently, the T1-weighted anatomical image was segmented and normalized to MNI
space based on SPM’s tissue probability maps. Normalization of the functional
images was achieved by applying the resulting deformation fields to the realigned
and co-registered functional images. Lastly, functional data were smoothed using a
6 mm full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian smoothing kernel.
Single-subject level analysis of fMRI data during extinction learning (day 2).
In order to investigate potential spontaneous reactivations of CS+ offset-related
vmPFC multivoxel patterns, we analyzed the extinction session data (day 2)
using a general linear model (GLM), including one regressor each for CS+
onsets, CS− onsets, pre- and postextinction US-expectancy ratings, and context
on-/offset. In addition, the model included one regressor for the first five CS+
offsets, at which the omission of the US is unexpected, and one for the first five
CS− offsets, at which US omission is expected by the participant. Further, one
regressor for the remaining ten CS+ and one regressor for the remaining ten
CS− offsets were included. For control analyses (Supplementary Fig. 5B, C) we
created an additional single-subject level model including CS+ onsets, CS−
onsets, US-expectancy ratings, context on-/offsets and one regressor each for the
first, middle, and last five CS+ and CS− offsets, respectively. Including three
(first, middle, and last five) instead of two CS offset (first five and last ten)
regressors for each CS did not change the results (data not shown). All regressors
were modeled as delta-functions and convolved with the canonical hemody-
namic response function (HRF). Even though CS onset- and CS offset-related
regressors succeeded each other by 4.5 s only, correlations between the HRF-
convolved regressors were low (Supplementary Fig. 9). FAST correction for
autocorrelation and a high-pass filter (128 s) were applied.
Multivariate fMRI analysis of postextinction pattern reactivation. The multi-
voxel patterns evoked by the first five US omissions at CS+ and CS− offset in the
vmPFC region of interest (ROI; Harvard-Oxford Atlas, Harvard Center for Mor-
phometric Analysis, thresholded at 50% tissue probability) were extracted from the
resulting beta-maps in the vmPFC. Resting-state data were analyzed in accordance
with a previous study examining associative memory reactivation23, i.e., GLMs for
each resting-state scan (pre- and 0, 45, and 90 min postextinction) included delta-
function regressors for each volume, thereby accounting for potential reactivations,
which may occur during any point of the resting-state scan. No high-pass filtering
was applied in the resting-state models, and AR(1) autocorrelation correction was
employed. Multivoxel patterns during the resting-state were extracted from the
resulting beta-image series in the vmPFC (TR: 1 s, i.e., 480 − 5 = 475 beta images).
Subsequently, we correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient) the patterns evoked by
the first 5 CS+ and CS− offsets with the resulting 475 patterns of all four resting-
state scans and Fisher Z-transformed the correlation coefficients. The 475 correla-
tions of the CS+/CS− offset patterns with the resting-state patterns recorded before
extinction learning were employed to create a baseline distribution. The mean and
standard deviation of this baseline distribution were used to transform each cor-
relation between the CS+ and CS− offset pattern and the postextinction resting-
state patterns into a Z-score (Zi = (ri – μ)/σ), following a previous study23. In line
with previous work23, correlations with a Z-score exceeding a value of 2 (Z > 2 ≈ P <
0.05) were considered potential spontaneous postextinction reactivations of the
CS+/CS− offset pattern. Note, however, that results do not depend on the exact
threshold employed for defining potential reactivations (see Supplementary Fig. 3
for results with more liberal or conservative thresholds). Reactivations were sum-
med per participant and resting-state scan. The resulting reactivation numbers were
log-transformed before analysis in order to account for non-normality of the dis-
tribution (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test before transformation: all Ds(40) ≥ 0.17, all
Ps ≤ 0.004; after transformation: all Ds(40) ≥ 0.13, all Ps ≤ 0.08; but see Supple-
mentary Fig. 2 for results with nontransformed data). Subsequently, multiple linear
regression analysis with the (log-transformed) number of potential CS+ and CS−
offset vmPFC pattern reactivations at all resting-states scans (day 2) as independent
and CRs (mean SCR CS+ > CS−) at test (day 3) as dependent variable was
performed (main text Fig. 2b). The effect of L-DOPA on the number of potential
vmPFC reactivations was assessed using repeated-measures ANOVA with time
(pre- and 10, 45, 90, postextinction) as within- and group (placebo/L-DOPA) as
between-subject factor (main text Fig. 2e, f). In addition to our a priori hypothesis
concerning the vmPFC, we also tested the relationship between CRs at test (mean
SCR CS+ > CS−, day 3) and postextinction number of reactivations in the vmPFC
and eight further anatomically defined control ROIs to assess regional specificity of
the vmPFC findings using multiple linear regression (Supplementary Fig. 4). Fol-
lowing previous work48, the following anatomical ROIs were employed due to their
involvement in fear and extinction learning based on the Harvard-Oxford Atlas
(Harvard Center for Morphometric Analysis, thresholded at 50% tissue probability):
bilateral amygdala, hippocampus and insula, as well as the superior frontal gyrus
(SFG) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Results were considered significant
when below P = 0.05 (two-sided tests).
Single-subject level analysis of fMRI data during test (day 3). In order to
investigate the effect of number of spontaneous postextinction vmPFC reactiva-
tions (day 2) on fear-related (CS+ > CS−) BOLD responses at test on day 3 (main
text Fig. 2c), we analyzed the preprocessed fMRI data using a GLM with one
regressor for CS+ and CS− presentations each, pre- and post-test US-expectancy
ratings and context on-/offsets. All regressors were modeled as delta-functions and
convolved with the HRF. FAST correction for autocorrelation and a high-pass filter
(128 s) were applied.
Group level analysis of univariate fMRI data. In order to test the effect of
number of spontaneous postextinction vmPFC reactivations (day 2) on fear-related
(CS+ > CS−) BOLD responses at test on day 3 on the group level (main text
Fig. 2c), we employed SPM’s multiple regression with the number of potential
vmPFC pattern reactivations, group and their interaction as regressors and the
CS+ > CS− contrast at test on day 3 as outcome measure. Results were considered
significant when exceeding a threshold of P = 0.05, small-volume and family-wise
error corrected in the ROIs specified for multivariate main- and control analyses48,
i.e., bilateral amygdala, hippocampus and insula, as well as SFG, ACC, and vmPFC.
Mediation analysis. To test whether the effect of L-DOPA on CRs at test on day 3
was potentially mediated by the number of potential CS+ offset-related vmPFC
reactivations (45 min postextinction), we conducted mediation analysis (R package
“mediation”). Results (main text Fig. 2g) were considered significant when below P =
0.05 (two-sided tests).
