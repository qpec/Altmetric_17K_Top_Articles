orbid obesity is an epidemic in affluent countries.1
Currently,approximately6%ofAmericanshavemor-
bidobesity2becauseconventionalmethodsofweight
control, such as diet, exercise, and behavioral counseling, are
often insufficient for treating morbid obesity.3 In contrast, bar-
iatric surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity, lead-
ing to an estimated 60% to 80% reduction in excess weight
within a year of surgery.4,5 These surgical procedures work by
restricting gastric capacity (eg, gastric banding or resection),
reducing absorption surface (eg, intestinal bypass), or a com-
bination of both (eg, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass).4,6 Previous
reviews5,7,8 confirm a safety profile of bariatric surgery with
surgical mortality rates that average less than 1%. The re-
cently demonstrated efficacy of this procedure in treating type
2 diabetes mellitus further increases the potential indication
of these operations in complicated obesity.8
Mental health problems are prevalent in morbidly obese
patientsandthoseundergoingbariatricsurgery.9,10Theseprob-
lems, including current substance misuse, major depression,
and eating disorders, can compromise the surgical outcomes
and success.11 Consequently, most bariatric care programs in
North America involve mental health professionals to evalu-
ate and prepare patients for maximum success.12-15 Most of
these professionals prefer conducting clinical interviews, and
many also use symptom inventories (eg, Beck Depression
Inventory).16 The American Society for Metabolic and Bariat-
ric Surgery acknowledges that there is no consensus among ex-
perts on the structure, content, and inclusion criteria for these
IMPORTANCE Self-harm behaviors, including suicidal ideation and past suicide attempts, are
frequent in bariatric surgery candidates. It is unclear, however, whether these behaviors are
mitigated or aggravated by surgery.
OBJECTIVE To compare the risk of self-harm behaviors before and after bariatric surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this population-based, self-matched, longitudinal
cohort analysis, we studied 8815 adults from Ontario, Canada, who underwent bariatric
surgery between April 1, 2006, and March 31, 2011. Follow-up for each patient was 3 years
prior to surgery and 3 years after surgery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-harm emergencies 3 years before and after surgery.
RESULTS The cohort included 8815 patients of whom 7176 (81.4%) were women, 7063
(80.1%) were 35 years or older, and 8681 (98.5%) were treated with gastric bypass. A total of
111 patients had 158 self-harm emergencies during follow-up. Overall, self-harm emergencies
significantly increased after surgery (3.63 per 1000 patient-years) compared with before
surgery (2.33 per 1000 patient-years), equaling a rate ratio (RR) of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.03-2.30;
P = .007). Self-harm emergencies after surgery were higher than before surgery among
patients older than 35 years (RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.05-2.94; P = .03), those with a low-income
status (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.20-3.65; P = .01), and those living in rural areas (RR, 6.49; 95%
CI, 1.42-29.63; P = .02). The most common self-harm mechanism was an intentional overdose
(115 [72.8%]). A total of 147 events (93.0%) occurred in patients diagnosed as having a
mental health disorder during the 5 years before the surgery.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, the risk of self-harm emergencies increased after
bariatric surgery, underscoring the need for screening for suicide risk during follow-up.

Studies have found that weight loss positively influences
mental health,9,18 but findings are mixed in patients under-
goingbariatricsurgery.11,19,20Intheory,thepermanentchanges
in body image, diet-related stress, and unmet expectations of
weight loss could increase mental health problems, such as
bingeeating,substancemisuse,andself-harmbehaviors.15,21,22
Conversely, neurohormonal mechanisms may underlie post-
operative mental health problems23,24; for example, gastric by-
pass surgery can reduce levels of peripherally released neu-
ropeptides that regulate the centrally acting neuropeptide Y,23
a neurohormone associated with depression, addiction, and
suicide.24-26 The nature of these conflicting theories is at best
exploratory and indicates substantial uncertainty about
whether bariatric surgery has positive or negative effects on
mental health.27
Previous work28 has increased concerns about the inci-
dence of self-harm in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. A
systematic review28 of 30 studies suggested that suicide risk
for patients undergoing bariatric surgery was 4 times higher
than the general population norm. The temporal proximity of
some suicides immediately after bariatric surgery also sug-
gested a causal relationship.28-30 To further evaluate this as-
sociation, we compared self-harm behaviors before and after
bariatric surgery using province-wide health registers.29
Methods
Study Design
We conducted a population-based, self-matched, longitudi-
nal cohort analysis of patients living in Ontario who under-
went bariatric surgery. We used an exposure crossover design
in which patients undergoing bariatric surgery served as their
owncontrols.31Themainstrengthofthisapproachwastoelimi-
nate confounding owing to genetics, personality, and all other
stable characteristics. The incidence of self-harm emergen-
cies in the 3 years after surgery was compared with the inci-
dence in the 3 years before surgery. The Ethics Review Board

Study Population
This study included all adults aged 18 to 65 years living in
Ontario, Canada, who underwent bariatric surgery between
April 1, 2006, and March 31, 2011. The data analyses were com-
pleted between October 2014 and March 2015. Follow-up for
each patient was 3 years prior to surgery and 3 years after sur-
gery. The last date of follow-up was March 31, 2014. In On-
tario, patients qualified for bariatric surgery if their body mass
index (calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared) exceeded 40 or exceeded 35 with any of the
following 4 conditions: coronary heart disease, type 2 diabe-
tes, sleep apnea, or medically refractory hypertension.32 Eli-
gible patients were evaluated for surgery by the multidisci-
plinary team, including psychologists and psychiatrists, at a
central intake and assessment center.33,34 In Ontario, the mini-
mum age for bariatric surgery is 18 years. We selected the up-
per age limit based on the statistics that few patients older than
65 years undergo bariatric surgery.35,36 Individuals lacking a
valid Ontario health card or who had multiple bariatric opera-
tions were excluded. All patients had at least 3 years of evalu-
ation before (eg, April 1, 2003) and 3 years after surgery (eg,
March 31, 2014) based on their use of health care services. The
sampling was comprehensive and population based, reflect-
ing the practice of approximately 200 surgeons.
Data Sources
Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery
Eligible patients were identified from the Ontario Health In-
surance Plan database, which tracks outpatient and inpatient
surgical procedures. By using fee codes for bariatric proce-
dures (S114, S120, and S189), we extracted patient informa-
tion about the date and type of procedure, namely, gastric
bypass, intestinal bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy. These op-
erations represent more than 70% to 80% of bariatric proce-
dures performed in North America37 and approximately 98%
of public funded procedures performed in Ontario in 2013.35
Self-harm Events
Dataonself-harmeventswereextractedfromtheNationalAm-
bulatory Care Reporting System and recorded using the Inter-
nationalClassificationofDiseases,10thRevision(ICD-10),codes.
This data set systematically records all the emergency visits
in Ontario.38 The data were recorded from all accredited emer-
gency departments, including those providing care for men-
tal health conditions. This data set has been previously used
to evaluate the risk of suicide after an emergency visit related
to a self-poisoning.39 In this study, we categorized 4 distinct
mechanismsofself-harmbehaviors,namely,medications(X61-
64), alcohol (X65), poisoning by toxic chemicals (X66-69), and
physical trauma (X70-84). Each emergency was considered as
a separate visit. Additional data on ambulance use and hospi-
talization were extracted from the National Ambulatory Care
Reporting System as binary variables (yes or no). Triage ur-
gency was coded according to Canadian Triage Acuity Scale by
grouping as higher (ie, resuscitation, emergency, and urgent)
or lower (all remaining).40,41

300 and 309), and alcohol misuse (ICD-10 code F10 and ICD-9
code 303) during the 5 years before surgery.
Statistical Analysis
We compared the rate of self-harm emergencies during the
3 years after surgery to the rate of self-harm emergencies
during the 3 years before surgery. Each interval was then di-
vided into segments of 13 weeks (91 days), hereafter termed
quarters.47Generalizedestimatingequationmodelingwasused
to compute rate ratios of self-harm emergencies in the post-
operative interval compared with the preoperative interval.
Rate ratios were computed for relevant patient subgroups and
after excluding patients with 4 or more emergencies in the fol-
low-up period. All the analyses were performed using SAS
statistical software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
A total of 8815 patients underwent bariatric surgery during the
5-year enrollment interval (Table 1). Of the patients, 7176
(81.4%)werewomen,themean(SD)agewas42(10)years,7386
(83.8%) lived in urban areas, and 4050 (45.9%) had a lower-
income status. A total of 8681 patients (98.5%) received Roux-
en-Y gastric bypass, 89 (1.0%) received an intestinal bypass,
and 45 (0.5%) received a sleeve gastrectomy. A total of 5635
patients (63.9%) had a history of anxiety disorders, 688 (7.8%)
had mental health disorders, and 54 (0.6%) had alcohol mis-
use. All-cause mortality at 3 years was 1%.
Self-harm Emergencies
A total of 111 patients (1.3%) had at least 1 self-harm emer-
gency before or after surgery, including 11 who experienced
emergencies in both intervals, 37 in the preoperative inter-
val, and 63 in the postoperative interval. A total of 62 sepa-
rate self-harm events occurred in the preoperative interval and
96 in the postoperative interval. The overall rate averaged ap-
proximately5eventsperquarterinthepreoperativeperiodand
8 events per quarter in the postoperative period (Figure). Most
events were reported in women (n = 144), those who were 35
years or older (n = 111), those living in urban areas (n = 143),
or those diagnosed as having mental health disorder in the last
4 years (n = 147). Six patients had 5 or more emergencies dur-
ing follow-up.
The mean rate of self-harm in the preoperative period was
2.33 events per 1000 patients annually, whereas the rate in the
postoperative period was 3.63 events per 1000 patients annu-
ally (Table 2). The observed increase yielded a rate ratio of 1.54
(95% CI, 1.03-2.30; P = .007). Significant increases were par-
ticularly evident in those 35 years or older, those with lower-
income status, and those living in rural areas. We evaluated for

Medication overdose accounted for 115 events (72.8%),
whereas physical trauma, including self-hanging, accounted
for 33 events (20.9%). Ambulance involvement occurred in ap-
proximately half of events. Almost all events were consid-
ered of high triage urgency and resulted in hospitalization
(Table 3). No emergency department deaths related to self-
harm were reported. Emergencies in the postoperative pe-
riod required more use of ambulance services and were more
likely to be high urgency.
Discussion
This study examined changes in self-harm emergencies
after bariatric surgery in a relatively large sample of
patients. The findings indicate that a few patients had self-
harm emergencies; however, the risk of these emergencies
increased significantly after surgery. Overall, the self-harm
risk increased from 2 per 1000 patient-years to 3 per 1000
patient-years after bariatric surgery and equals a mean
increase of approximately 50%. Stratified analysis revealed
increased, yet nonâ€“statistically significant, risks among
those with a lower-income status and living in rural areas.

Nearly all events occurred in patients who had a history of
mental health disorder. Intentional self-poisoning by medi-
cations was the most common mechanism of attempted sui-
cide. These events carried significant risk to the patient,
with 85 (53.8%) requiring ambulance transport to a hospital,
147 (93.0%) classified as urgent, and 85 (53.8%) leading to a
hospital admission.
Suicide is a recognized concern among patients
undergoing bariatric surgery.30 Several large studies and a
meta-analysis28,30,48 consistently indicate that suicide rates
were at least 4 times higher in patients undergoing bariatric
surgery compared with the general population. Suicide deaths
are an infrequent outcome when evaluating self-harm risks in
patients.49 This study suggests that the rate of self-harm emer-
gencies in patients undergoing bariatric surgery was approxi-
mately 3.6 per 1000 patients annually, which is 3 times as high
as the baseline population rate in Ontario of 1.2 per 1000
person-years.50 Because self-harm emergencies are a strong
predictor of suicide,51 these findings highlight the impor-
tance of screening for self-harm behaviors in patients under-
going bariatric surgery.
Our findings can be useful for planning postoperative
care in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The usual
practice involves multiple visits during the first postopera-
tive year with less frequent contact in subsequent years.16,52
This study found that the period for mental health support
may need to be longer for some patients. This study also
suggests that some patient factors may help identify
patients at higher risk of self-harm. Rates were specifically
distinctly accentuated in patients living in lower-income
and rural areas, a pattern potentially relevant to screening
and preparing patients for postoperative outcomes.53,54 One
possible strategy, for example, might include activating a
reliable support network to mitigate stress after postopera-
tive changes in diet and lifestyle.55 Patients with a history of
major depression similarly accounted for almost all events,
suggesting that such patients merit a comprehensive
risk assessment. Last, medication misuse is a frequent
mechanism,28 thereby potentially suggesting the need for
increased screening and monitoring for excessive drug or
alcohol use.
The study findings may also be useful for emergency
physicians indirectly involved in the care of patients under-
going bariatric surgery. Several past studies7,56-58 indicate
increases in emergencies of all types during the postopera-
tive period. This study found that patients undergoing bar-
iatric surgery tend to have higher ambulance use and hospi-
talizations compared with other patients.41 Emergency
medicine physicians often typically focus on acute compli-
cations rather than the long-term mental health problems
exacerbated after surgery.58 This study suggests that a post-
operative emergency visit could be an opportunity to screen
for mental health in patients that have undergone bariatric
surgery.59
The published literature provides differing reasons for
the association between bariatric surgery and the subse-
quent risk of self-harm. One hypothesis is that changes in
alcohol metabolism after surgery may increase the likeli-
hood of alcohol intoxication60 or alcohol-related disinhibi-
tion with impulsivity leading to self-harm after surgery.61
The eating behaviors that lead to morbid obesity are often
alternately considered as addictive behaviors,62 and surgery
might lead to the method of substitution from food to sub-
stance misuse. A different hypothesis relates to increased
stress and anxiety in postoperative patients,15,63 leading to
anxiolytic use12 or exacerbation of preexisting mental
health conditions.64 Last, the direct effects of surgery on
the levels of neurohormones (eg, neuropeptide Y) need to
be investigated as possible mediators of the likelihood of
depression and suicidal behaviors.23,25 Findings from this
study advocate a better understanding of these and other
theories through future research of potential mechanisms of
self-harm in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.23
This study has several limitations. In particular, the data
did not account for important surgery-related factors, such as
failure in weight reduction or increases in postoperative stress
contributing to self-harm behaviors after surgery.31 In addi-
tion, our database was not entirely comprehensive because
somepatientsmighthavehadbariatricsurgicalproceduresout-
side Ontario.65,66 The ICD-10 codes may overestimate or un-
derestimate self-harm behaviors because substance misuse or
intoxications may not have had a self-harming intent and be-
cause determining intent is often problematic.28 Further-
more, emergency visits as an outcome could be an underes-
timate of actual self-harm behaviors. Previous work67,68
indicates that only half of the patients with self-harmâ€“related
injuries, including deaths, reach an emergency department.
In addition, only ICD-10 codes for emergency visits were ex-
tractedinthisstudy.Becausecompletedsuicidesgenerallypre-
clude an emergency visit, these study methods do not pro-
vide a sensitive assay for suicide deaths. Moreover, the study
interpretationsmighthavebenefittedbyhavingacontrolgroup
matched for a comparable surgery, yet comparisons to hernia
surgerymaybebiasedbecauseofthelimitedinformationabout
associated suicide risk and the potential limits in interpreting
confounders.69 Last, this study may have selection bias be-
cause the Ontario Health Insurance Plan does not include gas-
tric banding procedures.70 Despite these limitations, the study
findings provide an impetus for exploring self-harm behav-
iors after bariatric surgery.
Conclusions
Patients undergoing bariatric surgery have an increased risk
for self-harm emergencies after the surgery. These adverse
events undermine the overall benefits of bariatric surgery. The
study findings could be useful for bariatric surgeons and emer-
gency physicians in postoperative follow-up. Additional clini-
calimplicationsincludeactivepostoperativescreeningforself-
harm risk among patients who have undergone bariatric
surgery and are presenting for follow up. Patient and surgery
factors could help identify vulnerable patients. Overall, these
findings imply that more work is needed to understand why
self-harm behaviors increase in the postoperative period and
how these risks might be reduced.
