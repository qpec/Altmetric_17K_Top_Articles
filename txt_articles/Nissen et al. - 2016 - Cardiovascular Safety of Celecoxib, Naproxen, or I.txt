Abstract: Background The cardiovascular safety of celecoxib, as compared with nonselective nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), remains uncertain. Methods Patients who required NSAIDs for os-
teoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and were at increased cardiovascular risk were randomly assigned
to receive celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen. The goal of the trial was to assess the noninferiority of
celecoxib with regard to the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death (including hemorrhagic
death), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Noninferiority required a hazard ratio of 1.12
or lower, as well as an upper 97.5% confidence limit of 1.33 or lower in the intention-to-treat population
and of 1.40 or lower in the on-treatment population. Gastrointestinal and renal outcomes were also adju-
dicated. Results A total of 24,081 patients were randomly assigned to the celecoxib group (mean [±SD]
daily dose, 209±37 mg), the naproxen group (852±103 mg), or the ibuprofen group (2045±246 mg) for a
mean treatment duration of 20.3±16.0 months and a mean follow-up period of 34.1±13.4 months. During
the trial, 68.8% of the patients stopped taking the study drug, and 27.4% of the patients discontinued
follow-up. In the intention-to-treat analyses, a primary outcome event occurred in 188 patients in the
celecoxib group (2.3%), 201 patients in the naproxen group (2.5%), and 218 patients in the ibuprofen
group (2.7%) (hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. naproxen, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.13;
hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. ibuprofen, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.04; P<0.001 for noninferiority in both
comparisons). In the on-treatment analysis, a primary outcome event occurred in 134 patients in the cele-
coxib group (1.7%), 144 patients in the naproxen group (1.8%), and 155 patients in the ibuprofen group
(1.9%) (hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. naproxen, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.15; hazard ratio for celecoxib
vs. ibuprofen, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.02; P<0.001 for noninferiority in both comparisons). The risk of
gastrointestinal events was significantly lower with celecoxib than with naproxen (P=0.01) or ibuprofen
(P=0.002); the risk of renal events was significantly lower with celecoxib than with ibuprofen (P=0.004)
but was not significantly lower with celecoxib than with naproxen (P=0.19). Conclusions At moderate
doses, celecoxib was found to be noninferior to ibuprofen or naproxen with regard to cardiovascular safety.

BACKGROUND
The cardiovascular safety of celecoxib, as compared with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), remains uncertain.
METHODS
Patients who required NSAIDs for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and were at in-
creased cardiovascular risk were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, ibuprofen, or 
naproxen. The goal of the trial was to assess the noninferiority of celecoxib with regard 
to the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death (including hemorrhagic 
death), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Noninferiority required a haz-
ard ratio of 1.12 or lower, as well as an upper 97.5% confidence limit of 1.33 or lower in 
the intention-to-treat population and of 1.40 or lower in the on-treatment population. 
Gastrointestinal and renal outcomes were also adjudicated.
RESULTS
A total of 24,081 patients were randomly assigned to the celecoxib group (mean [±SD] 
daily dose, 209±37 mg), the naproxen group (852±103 mg), or the ibuprofen group 
(2045±246 mg) for a mean treatment duration of 20.3±16.0 months and a mean follow-up 
period of 34.1±13.4 months. During the trial, 68.8% of the patients stopped taking the 
study drug, and 27.4% of the patients discontinued follow-up. In the intention-to-treat 
analyses, a primary outcome event occurred in 188 patients in the celecoxib group (2.3%), 
201 patients in the naproxen group (2.5%), and 218 patients in the ibuprofen group (2.7%) 
(hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. naproxen, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.13; 
hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. ibuprofen, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.04; P<0.001 for noninferior-
ity in both comparisons). In the on-treatment analysis, a primary outcome event occurred 
in 134 patients in the celecoxib group (1.7%), 144 patients in the naproxen group (1.8%), 
and 155 patients in the ibuprofen group (1.9%) (hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. naproxen, 
0.90; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.15; hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. ibuprofen, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65 to 
1.02; P<0.001 for noninferiority in both comparisons). The risk of gastrointestinal events 
was significantly lower with celecoxib than with naproxen (P 
= 
0.01) or ibuprofen (P 
= 
0.002); 
the risk of renal events was significantly lower with celecoxib than with ibuprofen 
(P 
= 
0.004) but was not significantly lower with celecoxib than with naproxen (P 
= 
0.19).
CONCLUSIONS
At moderate doses, celecoxib was found to be noninferior to ibuprofen or naproxen with 
regard to cardiovascular safety. (Funded by Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00346216.)

N
onsteroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) were introduced in the 
1960s and became the most widely pre-
scribed class of drugs in the world, with more 
than 100 million prescriptions issued annually 
in the United States alone.1 NSAIDs inhibit cyclo-
oxygenase (COX), which reduces pain and inflam-
mation through the inhibition of prostaglandins. 
However, the COX enzyme is also present in 
gastric mucosa, where it stimulates gastropro-
tective prostaglandins. The identification of two 
isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, and the recognition 
that antiinflammatory and analgesic effects are 
mediated through COX-2 inhibition — whereas 
the gastrointestinal toxic effects are linked to 
COX-1 inhibition — resulted in the development 
of selective COX-2 inhibitors that offered the po-
tential to retain efficacy while reducing gastro-
intestinal adverse effects.2
Evidence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes 
in a placebo-controlled trial resulted in the with-
drawal of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib 
in 2004.3 On the basis of a small number of events, 
the results of another trial suggested that cardio-
vascular harm may result from the use of higher-
than-approved doses of celecoxib.4 Subsequently, 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed 
continued marketing of celecoxib, the sole re-
maining selective COX-2 inhibitor, but mandated 
a cardiovascular safety trial. In the Prospective 
Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated 
Safety versus Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) 
trial, we sought to assess cardiovascular, gastro-
intestinal, renal, and other outcomes with cele-
coxib as compared with two nonselective NSAIDs.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
PRECISION was a randomized, multicenter, dou-
ble-blind, noninferiority trial involving patients 
who were at increased cardiovascular risk and 
had rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Ran-
domization was stratified according to the pri-
mary diagnosis (osteoarthritis or rheumatoid 
arthritis), aspirin use, and geographic region. 
Detailed methods for the trial have been pub-
lished previously,5 and both the protocol and the 
statistical analysis plan are available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org. At each center, 
either a central institutional review board (Schul-
man IRB) or the local institutional review board 
approved the trial, and the patients provided 
written informed consent. A multidisciplinary 
executive committee supervised the trial, and an 
independent data and safety monitoring com-
mittee reviewed unblinded data to assess safety. 
The members of the committees are listed in 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. 
The members of the executive committee agreed 
not to accept any financial payments from any 
maker of NSAIDs for the duration of the trial. 
The trial sponsor (Pfizer) participated in the de-
sign of the trial and in the writing of the proto-
col in collaboration with the executive committee 
and in consultation with the FDA; the sponsor 
also assisted with data collection and maintained 
the trial database. The sponsor shared opera-
tional roles with the Cleveland Clinic Coordinat-
ing Center for Clinical Research (C5Research) 
and several contract research organizations. Af-
ter the conclusion of the trial, the database was 
transferred to C5Research for statistical analy-
ses. The academic authors wrote the manuscript. 
The sponsor was allowed to review and comment 
on the manuscript, but the decision to publish 
and the final contents were determined by the 
academic authors, with no contractual limits on 
the right to publish. All the authors had access 
to the final results, approved the manuscript, 
and assume responsibility for its accuracy and 
completeness and for the adherence of the trial 
and this report to the protocol.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We enrolled patients who were 18 years of age or 
older and who, as determined by the patient and 
physician, required daily treatment with NSAIDs 
for arthritis pain; patients whose arthritis pain 
was managed adequately with acetaminophen 
were not eligible. A key inclusion criterion was 
established cardiovascular disease or an increased 
risk of the development of cardiovascular dis-
ease (defined in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Other inclusion criteria and the exclusion criteria 
are provided in the protocol and in a previous 
publication.5
Treatment
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, 
to receive celecoxib (100 mg twice a day), ibuprofen 
(600 mg three times a day), or naproxen (375 mg 
twice a day) with matching placebo. At subse-
quent visits, for patients with rheumatoid arthri-

tis, investigators could increase the dose of cele-
coxib to 200 mg twice a day, the dose of 
ibuprofen to 800 mg three times a day, or the 
dose of naproxen to 500 mg twice a day for the 
treatment of symptoms. For patients with osteo-
arthritis, increases in the doses of ibuprofen and 
naproxen were permitted; however, regulatory 
dosing restrictions precluded dose escalation for 
celecoxib in these patients. Esomeprazole (20 to 
40 mg) was provided to all patients for gastric 
protection. Investigators were encouraged to pro-
vide cardiovascular preventive management in ac-
cordance with local standards and guidelines. Pa-
tients who were taking low-dose aspirin (≤325 mg 
daily) were permitted to continue this therapy.
Adjudicated and Other Outcomes
The primary composite outcome, in a time-to-
event analysis, was the first occurrence of an 
adverse event that met Antiplatelet Trialists Col-
laboration (APTC) criteria (i.e., death from car-
diovascular causes, including hemorrhagic death; 
nonfatal myocardial infarction; or nonfatal stroke).6 
A secondary composite outcome, major adverse 
cardiovascular events, included the components 
of the primary outcome plus coronary revascu-
larization or hospitalization for unstable angina 
or transient ischemic attack. Secondary outcomes 
also included clinically significant gastrointesti-
nal events. Tertiary outcomes included clinically 
significant renal events, iron deficiency anemia 
of gastrointestinal origin, and hospitalization for 
heart failure or hypertension. (Definitions are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.) Al-
though it is not described in the protocol, the 
composite outcome of clinically significant gas-
trointestinal events or iron deficiency anemia of 
gastrointestinal origin was designated as the key 
gastrointestinal safety outcome before the trial 
data were unblinded. An independent committee 
of multidisciplinary specialists at C5Research who 
were unaware of the treatment assignments re-
viewed and adjudicated events. An assessment of 
the intensity of arthritis pain with the use of the 
Visual Analogue Scale for Pain (VAS) (scores range 
from 0 to 100 mm, with higher scores indicating 
worse pain) was a nonadjudicated secondary out-
come; differences greater than 13.7 mm are con-
sidered to be clinically meaningful.7 The incidence 
of death from any cause was a prespecified tertiary 
outcome. Other prespecified outcomes are listed 
in the protocol and statistical analysis plan.
Statistical Analysis
Naproxen was designated as the primary com-
parator for the assessment of the noninferiority 
of celecoxib. Noninferiority comparisons of cele-
coxib versus ibuprofen and of ibuprofen versus 
naproxen were also prespecified. Noninferiority 
required four criteria to be met; in the original 
design, a hazard ratio not exceeding 1.12 was 
required, with an upper limit of the one-sided 
97.5% confidence interval of less than 1.33 in 
both the intention-to-treat population and the 
on-treatment population. The assessment of the 
on-treatment population included events that 
occurred while patients were taking the study 
drug and during the 30 days after discontinuation. 
The trial was event-driven, requiring 762 events to 
provide 90% power to determine noninferiority. 
Under the assumption of an annual event rate of 
2% and a treatment discontinuation rate of 40%, 
the required sample size was estimated to be 
20,000 patients. The observed event rate was 
lower, the discontinuation rate higher, and the 
enrollment rate slower than anticipated. At the 
recommendation of the data and safety monitor-
ing committee and after consultation with the 
FDA, the protocol was amended to have the study 
provide 80% power, and the upper 97.5% confi-
dence limit for noninferiority in the on-treatment 
population was modified to 1.40, which required 
580 events in the intention-to-treat population 
and 420 events in the on-treatment population. 
The protocol prespecified a minimum follow-up 
time of 18 months, with censoring of data from 
event-free patients after 30 months in the inten-
tion-to-treat population and after 43 months in 
the on-treatment population.
A Cox proportional-hazards model with adjust-
ment for stratification factors was used to calcu-
late the hazard ratios and confidence intervals. 
A one-sided noninferiority P value of less than 
0.025 was considered to indicate statistical sig-
nificance for the primary end point, with no ad-
justment for multiple comparisons. P values for 
secondary analyses in the intention-to-treat popu-
lation are reported for descriptive purposes; a two-
sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered 
to indicate statistical significance, with no ad-
justment for multiple comparisons. For the on-
treatment analyses, P values for noninferiority 
are reported for the primary APTC outcome, but 
P values are not reported for superiority compari-
sons. Additional details regarding the statistical

Results
Patient Population
We screened 31,857 patients; a total of 24,222 
patients underwent randomization at 926 centers 
in 13 countries between October 23, 2006, and 
June 30, 2014, and 141 were excluded from the 
analysis (106 were determined to be fraudulently 
enrolled, and 35 enrolled more than once), leav-
ing 24,081 participants who could be included in 
the analysis. There were 8072 patients assigned 
to the celecoxib group (mean [±SD] daily dose, 
209±37 mg), 7969 assigned to the naproxen group 
(852±103 mg), and 8040 assigned to the ibupro-
fen group (2045±246 mg). The characteristics of 
the patients at baseline were similar among the 
treatment groups (Table 1). The mean durations 
of treatment and follow-up, respectively, were 
20.3±16.0 and 34.1±13.4 months for all patients: 
20.8±16.0 and 34.2±13.4 months in the celecoxib 
group, 20.5±15.9 and 34.2±13.3 months in the 
naproxen group, and 19.6±16.0 and 33.8±13.6 
months in the ibuprofen group. During this 10-
year trial, 68.8% of patients stopped taking the 
study drug, and 27.4% of patients discontinued 
follow-up; 2.5% of patients died, 8.3% withdrew 
consent in writing, 7.4% verbally expressed un-
willingness to continue participation, and 7.2% 
were lost to follow-up before a final follow-up 
visit. Details regarding patient disposition, time 
to study-drug discontinuation, and time to non-
retention in the trial are provided in Figures S1, 
S2, and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Primary APTC Outcome
In the intention-to-treat population (Table 2 and 
Fig. 1), the primary APTC outcome occurred in 
188 patients in the celecoxib group (2.3%), 201 
in the naproxen group (2.5%), and 218 in the 
ibuprofen group (2.7%). The hazard ratio for this 
outcome in the celecoxib group, as compared 
with the naproxen group, was 0.93 (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.13; P<0.001 for 
noninferiority). The hazard ratio for celecoxib 
versus ibuprofen was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.04; 
P<0.001 for noninferiority), and the hazard ratio 
for ibuprofen versus naproxen was 1.08 (95% CI, 
0.90 to 1.31; P 
= 
0.02 for noninferiority) (Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
In the on-treatment population (Table 3 and 
Fig. 1), the primary APTC outcome occurred in 
134 patients in the celecoxib group (1.7%), 144 
in the naproxen group (1.8%), and 155 in the 
ibuprofen group (1.9%). The hazard ratio in the 
celecoxib group, as compared with the naproxen 
group, was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.15; P<0.001 
for noninferiority); for celecoxib versus ibupro-
fen, the hazard ratio was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.65 to 
1.02; P<0.001 for noninferiority), and for ibupro-
fen versus naproxen, the hazard ratio was 1.12 
(95% CI, 0.89 to 1.40; P 
= 
0.025 for noninferior-
ity) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Celecoxib, as compared with either naproxen 
or ibuprofen, met all four prespecified noninfe-
riority requirements (P<0.001 for noninferiority 
in both comparisons). Ibuprofen, as compared 
with naproxen, just met the noninferiority crite-
ria (P 
= 
0.025).
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events  
and Mortality Outcomes
The results of the intention-to-treat analyses for 
the composite outcome of major adverse cardio-
vascular events and for the components of the 
outcome are reported in Table 2 and Figure 1. 
The hazard ratio for celecoxib versus naproxen 
was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.83 to 1.12; P 
= 
0.64), and the 
hazard ratio for celecoxib versus ibuprofen was 
0.87 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01; P 
= 
0.06). In pairwise 
comparisons for the components of the primary 
outcome, the differences between celecoxib and 
naproxen and between celecoxib and ibuprofen 
were not significant. The hazard ratio for death 
from any cause was 0.80 for celecoxib versus 
naproxen (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.00; P 
= 
0.052) (Table 2 
and Fig. 1). The rate of nonfatal myocardial in-
farction was higher in the ibuprofen group than 
in the naproxen group (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% 
CI, 1.01 to 1.91; P 
= 
0.04) (Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Gastrointestinal and Renal Outcomes
The results of the intention-to-treat analyses of 
gastrointestinal and renal outcomes are provided 
in Table 2 and Figure 1. The event rate for the 
composite outcome of serious gastrointestinal 
events was lower in the celecoxib group than in 
the naproxen group (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 
0.54 to 0.93; P 
= 
0.01) and was lower in the cele-
coxib group than in the ibuprofen group (hazard 
ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.85; P 
= 
0.002). The

Cardiovascular Safety of Celecoxib, Naproxen, or Ibuprofen
hazard ratio for gastrointestinal events in the 
ibuprofen group versus the naproxen group was 
1.08 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.39; P 
= 
0.53). Serious renal 
events occurred at a significantly lower rate in the 
celecoxib group than in the ibuprofen group (haz-
ard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.85; P 
= 
0.004), 
but the difference in the rate of this outcome in 
the celecoxib group versus the naproxen group 
was not significant (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 
0.56 to 1.12; P 
= 
0.19).
Other Outcomes
The rate of hospitalization for hypertension was 
significantly lower in the celecoxib group than 
in the ibuprofen group (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% 
CI, 0.36 to 0.99; P 
= 
0.04) but was not signifi-
cantly lower in the celecoxib group than in the 
naproxen group (Table 2). The results of analy-
ses of quality of life and efficacy for the relief of

The primary composite outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of an adverse event that met Antiplatelet Trialists Collaboration (APTC) criteria (death from car-
diovascular causes, including hemorrhagic death; nonfatal myocardial infarction; or nonfatal stroke). The P value for the noninferiority of celecoxib as compared with either naproxen or 
ibuprofen with regard to this outcome was <0.001.
‡  
The composite outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events included the components of the primary APTC outcome plus coronary revascularization or hospitalization for unstable 
angina or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Cardiovascular Safety of Celecoxib, Naproxen, or Ibuprofen
of pain with the use of the VAS scale, a sig-
nificant but small benefit was found for 
naproxen relative to celecoxib or ibuprofen; the 
change in VAS score from baseline was −9.3±0.26 
mm for celecoxib, −9.5±0.26 for ibuprofen, and 
−10.2±0.26 for naproxen (P<0.001 for naproxen 
versus celecoxib, P 
= 
0.01 for naproxen versus 
ibuprofen). The analyses of the primary compos-
ite outcome among prespecified subgroups showed 
no significant interactions for any pairwise com-
parison, including among the subgroups that were 
defined by aspirin use at baseline (Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Investigator-reported 
adverse effects that occurred in 3% or more of 
the patients in any treatment group are reported 
in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Discussion
The PRECISION trial was designed in the after-
math of the withdrawal of rofecoxib during a 
period of considerable scientific and public con-
troversy about the cardiovascular safety of selec-
tive COX-2 inhibitors. Previous knowledge about 
the relative safety of selective or nonselective COX 
inhibitors was limited, because NSAIDs received 
initial approval on the basis of relatively small, 
short-term studies that typically had been de-
signed to assess pain relief and general safety. 
The primary clinical concern was that celecoxib 
might be associated with adverse cardiovascular 
effects similar to those associated with rofecoxib. 
The PRECISION trial provides statistically strong 
evidence that the cardiovascular risk associated 
with moderate doses of celecoxib is not greater 
than that associated with nonselective NSAIDs. 
As compared with two widely used nonselective 
NSAIDs — naproxen and ibuprofen — celecoxib 
was associated with numerically fewer cardio-
vascular events, which resulted in noninferiority 
P values of less than 0.001. The trial results do 
not support the widely advocated belief that 
naproxen treatment, as compared with treatment 
with other NSAIDs, results in better cardiovas-
cular outcomes.8
To establish noninferiority, the trial design re-
quired that prespecified criteria be met in both the 
intention-to-treat population and the on-treatment 
population. We selected this approach because 
these two alternative analyses provide comple-
mentary insights into drug safety. The intention-
to-treat analysis is the only analysis that preserves 
the integrity of randomization, but it tends to 
dilute safety signals when patients do not adhere 
to the study treatment. The on-treatment analy-
sis considers events that occur only while patients 
are actually taking the study drug, which can 
strengthen safety signals. Although both the 
intention-to-treat and the on-treatment analyses 
were used to assess noninferiority, superiority 
comparisons were performed with the intention-
to-treat population. The on-treatment analyses 
are included to provide a complete accounting of 
outcomes, but the results in this population may 
have been influenced by between-group differ-
ences in rates of treatment discontinuation; there-
fore, these results are reported without P values 
and should be considered exploratory (Table 3).
We also included a broader outcome — major 
adverse cardiovascular events — as a secondary 
composite outcome to provide greater power to 
detect differences among the three treatments. 
Fewer major adverse cardiovascular events oc-
curred in the celecoxib group than in the ibuprofen 
group, but the difference did not reach signifi-
cance in the intention-to-treat population (P 
= 
0.06). 
The rate of death from any cause was lower in 
the celecoxib group than in the naproxen group, 
although the difference did not reach significance 
(P 
= 
0.052). We urge caution in interpreting these 
findings, because major adverse cardiovascular 
events was a secondary outcome and death from 
any cause a tertiary outcome, and these out-
comes were not adjusted for end-point multi-
plicity; in addition, major adverse cardiovascular 
events included more subjective components than 
did the APTC outcome.
Although the primary purpose of the trial 
was to assess cardiovascular outcomes, we also 
adjudicated gastrointestinal and renal outcomes 
to provide a comprehensive safety evaluation. To 
compare the three drugs, we constructed a two-
component composite of two adjudicated out-
comes — clinically significant gastrointestinal 
events and iron-deficiency anemia of gastrointes-
tinal origin. For this outcome, significantly fewer 
events occurred in the celecoxib group than in 
either the naproxen group or the ibuprofen group. 
These findings were expected on the basis of the 
theoretical gastrointestinal advantages of selec-
tive COX-2 inhibition. The differences were found 
despite esomeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor, 
being provided for all patients, although we do 
not have information on adherence to this ther-

lower in the celecoxib group than in the ibupro-
fen group, although they did not differ signifi-

in the ibuprofen group than in the celecoxib 
group and a higher incidence of hypertension in 
both the naproxen group and the ibuprofen group,

Hazard ratios were estimated with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model with adjustment for stratification factors.
†  
The primary composite outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of an adverse event that met APTC criteria (death from 
cardiovascular causes, including hemorrhagic death; nonfatal myocardial infarction; or nonfatal stroke). The P value for the noninferiority of 
celecoxib as compared with either naproxen or ibuprofen with regard to this outcome was <0.001.
‡  
The composite outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events included the components of the primary APTC outcome plus coronary re-
vascularization or hospitalization for unstable angina or TIA.

The primary composite outcome in the time-to-event 
analysis was the first occurrence of an adverse event 
that met Antiplatelet Trialists Collaboration (APTC) 
 
criteria (death from cardiovascular causes, including 
hemorrhagic death; nonfatal myocardial infarction; or 
nonfatal stroke). The definitions for all outcomes are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix. The cumula-
tive incidences were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier 
method, and the hazard ratios were calculated with  
the Cox proportional-hazards regression model with 
adjustment for stratification factors. The intention- 
to-treat data analyses were truncated at 30 months, 
and the on-treatment analyses were truncated at 43 
months. The insets show the same data on an en-
larged y axis.

than did patients treated with celecoxib or ibu-
profen, the differences were smaller than the 
13.7-mm difference that is considered to be clini-
cally meaningful.
The PRECISION trial had limitations. Adher-
ence and retention were lower than in most trials 
that assess cardiovascular outcomes, which re-
flects the challenges of long-term treatment of a 
painful condition in patients who frequently ex-
perience frustration with unrelieved symptoms 
and switch therapies or leave the trial. Low levels 
of adherence and retention have also been found 
in previous pain studies.9 Although the similar-
ity in the results for the intention-to-treat and 
on-treatment populations suggests that low ad-
herence was unlikely to have influenced the prin-
cipal conclusions, the high levels of nonretention 
make interpretation of the findings challenging. 
Although the rates of nonretention were similar 
for all three treatments, the possibility of infor-
mative censoring (i.e., the bias that is created 
when participants drop out of a study because of 
factors related to the study itself) cannot be 
ruled out. The large number of comparisons 
without adjustment for multiplicity increases the 
possibility of false positive findings.
The dose of celecoxib was limited by regula-
tory restrictions to 200 mg daily for most patients, 
which may have provided a potential safety ad-
vantage for celecoxib, although the mean doses 
for both nonselective NSAIDs were also sub-
maximal. Three previous trials assessed higher 
doses of celecoxib (400 to 800 mg per day),4,10,11 
one of which showed a significantly higher risk 
of cardiovascular events in association with the 
unapproved 800-mg dose than with placebo, al-
though the trial included only a small number of 
events. Our results provide reassurance regard-
ing the safety of moderate doses of celecoxib but 
not the safety of high doses of celecoxib. Al-
though ibuprofen and naproxen have been re-
ported to potentially interfere with the antiplatelet 
effects of aspirin,12 we found no statistical inter-
action for aspirin use (Fig. S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). However, the trial was not spe-
cifically designed to assess the effects of aspirin 
on the relative safety of NSAIDs. Although enroll-
ment was stratified according to aspirin use to 
ensure equal distribution of aspirin use among 
the treatment groups, patients were not randomly 
assigned to receive or not receive aspirin.
The current results reflect the relative safety 
of only these three drugs and cannot provide 
insight into the effects of the more than two 
dozen other marketed NSAIDs, particularly be-
cause each of these drugs may have a unique 
safety profile. No inferences are possible regard-
ing the effects of NSAIDs as compared with 
placebo or regarding the safety of intermittent 
treatment with low-dose over-the-counter prepa-
rations. For ethical reasons, a placebo compari-
son group was not feasible, since we required all 
patients and physicians to document that partici-
pants had required NSAID treatment for at least 
6 months for adequate symptom relief. Acetamin-
ophen was not selected as a comparator because 
previous studies had shown this drug to be inef-
fective for the treatment of patients with NSAID-
dependent arthritis.13
In summary, the PRECISION trial showed the 
noninferiority of moderate doses of celecoxib, as 
compared with naproxen or ibuprofen, with re-
gard to the primary APTC cardiovascular out-
come. Celecoxib treatment also resulted in lower 
rates of gastrointestinal events than did either 
comparator drug and in lower rates of renal 
adverse events than did ibuprofen.
