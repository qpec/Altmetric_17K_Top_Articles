Increased cancer cell motility constitutes a root cause of end organ destruction and mortality,
but its complex regulation represents a barrier to precision targeting. We use the unique
characteristics of small molecules to probe and selectively modulate cell motility. By coupling
efficient chemical synthesis routes to multiple upfront in parallel phenotypic screens, we
identify that KBU2046 inhibits cell motility and cell invasion in vitro. Across three different
murine models of human prostate and breast cancer, KBU2046 inhibits metastasis,
decreases bone destruction, and prolongs survival at nanomolar blood concentrations after
oral administration. Comprehensive molecular, cellular and systemic-level assays all support
a high level of selectivity. KBU2046 binds chaperone heterocomplexes, selectively alters
binding of client proteins that regulate motility, and lacks all the hallmarks of classical cha-
perone inhibitors, including toxicity. We identify a unique cell motility regulatory mechanism
and synthesize a targeted therapeutic, providing a platform to pursue studies in humans.

ncreased cell motility is a fundamental characteristic of cancer
cells1. It is required in order for cells to invade through the
basement membrane, represents an initial step in the meta-
static cascade, and is necessary for cells to move from their pri-
mary organ of origin to distant metastatic sites. The movement of
cancer cells out of their primary organ of origin greatly reduces
the chances of survival2. Movement of cells to distant organs, and
their resultant destruction, constitutes a primary cause of cancer-
associated morbidity and mortality3. Processes that drive the
development of increased cell motility represent high-value
therapeutic targets. However, comprehensive endeavors aimed
at selectively inhibiting cancer cell motility and resultant metas-
tasis have met with failure4,5. While many pathways have been
shown to regulate cell motility, they constitute pathways whose
regulatory effects are pleiotropic5. It has therefore not been
possible to identify regulators of cell motility possessing the
selective capacity to support targeted manipulation.
Recognizing the critical importance and intractable nature of
this problem, we reasoned that it needed to be approached in a
unique manner. We did so by considering that small chemicals
have potent biological properties, that single atom changes in
their structure can affect those properties, that chemical structure
can be modulated, and that as such they constitute highly refined
biological probes. We hypothesized that we could use them to
identify novel and selective sites that regulate cancer cell motility
and that such sites would constitute high-value therapeutic
targets.
Herein,
we
delineate
a
novel
and
selective
regulatory
mechanism for these processes using efficient synthesis routes
and resultant small chemicals as biological probes. We go on to
demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the resultant probe,
KBU2046. We do so by demonstrating selectivity across com-
prehensive molecular, cellular, and systemic assays. Efficacy of
KBU2046 is demonstrated across several different in vitro models
and across multiple murine models of human cancer metastasis,
which includes decreased metastasis, decreased bone destruction,
and prolonged survival. Also, comprehensive pharmacokinetic
and toxicity studies further support therapeutic potential. Finally,
we go on to characterize the molecular mechanism and its ability
to perturb the novel regulatory process.
Results
Identifying a selective inhibitor of cell motility. We selected
flavonoids as a chemical scaffold to advance probe synthesis
because they exert a wide range of biological effects6. We began
with 4′,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone (genistein) as our starting point
because of its known anti-motility properties. We previously
demonstrated that nanomolar concentrations of genistein inhibit
human prostate cancer (PCa) cell invasion in vitro7, metastasis in
a murine orthotopic model8, and in the context of a prospective
human trial that it downregulates matrix metalloproteinase 2
(MMP-2) expression in prostate tissue9. While its diverse spec-
trum of biological effects render it unusable as a selective and
potent biological probe, these same properties maximize its
potential to selectively probe a wide spectrum of bioactive sites
upon chemical diversification.
We developed a series of related molecular probes through
phenotypically driven structure activity relationship studies,
specifically through chemical modification of the genistein
structure (aromatic substitution and ring saturation). These
compounds were advanced by iterative selection for inhibition
of human PCa cell invasion (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Note 1
and Supplementary Fig. 1). A major parallel goal was deselection
for inhibition of cell growth (an indicator of off-target effects).
Knowing that genistein has estrogenic action, and guided by the
crystal structure of genistein bound to estrogen receptor (ER)10,
we also de-selected for ER-binding. Through this strategy, (±)-3(4-
fluorophenyl)chroman-4-one (KBU2046), a halogen-substituted
isoflavanone, was discovered (Fig. 1a).
KBU2046 inhibits cell invasion with efficacy equal-to-or-
greater-than that of genistein for human prostate cells, including
normal prostate epithelial cells, as well as primary and metastatic
PCa cells (Fig. 1b). Cell migration is a major determinant of cell
invasion11, and KBU2046 inhibited the migration of human
prostate, breast, colon, and lung cancer cells (Fig. 1c). Impor-
tantly, KBU2046 had high selectivity in cellular assays. It was not
toxic to human prostate cells (Table 1), to human bone marrow
stem cells (Fig. 1d), nor to cells in the NCI-60 cell line panel
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Bone marrow toxicity is induced by a
wide spectrum of therapeutic agents, and is frequently a dose-
limiting toxicity for anti-cancer agents. Furthermore, in estrogen-
responsive human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, KBU2046 did not
activate estrogen-responsive genes (Fig. 1e and Supplementary
Fig. 3).
KBU2046 inhibits metastasis and prolongs survival. Because
metastasis is a systemic process, effective small molecule probes
must operate at the systemic level. We designed the probe to
contain chemical properties known to be associated with sys-
temically
active
small
molecules
(Supplementary
Fig.
4).
Employing a murine orthotopic implantation model of human
PCa previously characterized by us8, KBU2046 was shown to
significantly decrease metastasis in a dose-dependent manner by
up to 92%, at plasma concentrations of 1.1–24 nM (Fig. 2a, b).
Comprehensive characterization of KBU2046 pharmacokinetics
demonstrated maintenance of plasma concentrations >24 nM for
9.3 h after a single oral dose, and allowed for characterization of
pharmacokinetic parameters (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5).
At the systemic level, KBU2046 was a highly selective inhibitor of
metastasis. Comprehensive analysis of primary tumor growth,
animal behavior, weight, histologic examination of multiple
organs,
and
serum
chemistry
profiling
failed
to
identify
KBU2046-associated off-target effects (Supplementary Figs. 6, 7).
Recognizing the established link between metastasis and
decreased survival in humans, we evaluated KBU2046’s impact
on survival. The orthotopic PCa model exhibits tumor growth
around the urogenital tract, inhibiting renal function and
precluding assessment of the impact of metastatic burden on
survival. However, orthotopic implantation of human breast
cancer cells, followed by surgical removal of the resultant primary
tumor, provides a murine model wherein survival is dictated by
metastatic
burden12.
KBU2046
significantly
prolonged
the
survival of mice treated in a post-surgery adjuvant setting
(Fig. 2d).
If KBU2046 were inhibiting metastasis through inhibition of
cell motility, then it should have little to no effect upon the
metastatic process once cells have implanted into distant organs.
Recognizing that skeletal metastases are a major clinical problem
with PCa, further assessment of this paradigm was pursued with
an established PCa bone metastasis model13. PC3 luciferase
tagged (PC3-luc) cells were delivered by ultrasound-guided
intracardiac (IC) injection and metastatic outgrowth monitored
weekly via IVIS imaging (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 8).
Compared to control mice, the pre-cohort of mice (KBU2046
treatment starts 3 days prior to IC injection and continuing
through the end of the experiment) experienced a significant
decrease in total metastatic burden, as well as decreased
metastasis to the mandible (for which this model is designed)
(Fig. 3b, c). In contrast, with the post-cohort of mice, metastasis
to the total body as well as to the jaw do not differ from control

 mice. With the post-cohort of mice, cells are given 3 days post IC
injection to invade into distant organ sites before treatment is
begun, with treatment then continuing through the end of the
experiment. In the Pre7Stop cohort of mice, treatment starts
3 days prior to IC injection, continues through day 7 post IC
injection and is not given for the remaining 3 weeks of the
experiment.

 cohort of mice, yet the average value is below that of post-mice
and is approaching that of the pre-cohort of mice. Degradation of
the mandible was quantified with computed tomography in pre-,
post-, and control cohorts, demonstrating decreased destruction
of bone in the pre-cohort of animals (Fig. 3d, e).
KBU2046 induces changes in HSP90β phosphorylation. With
the aforementioned positive phenotypic cellular and animal stu-
dies, we sought to identify the molecular basis for KBU2046’s
biological action. Our initial investigations were guided by our
prior demonstration that low nanomolar concentrations of gen-
istein inhibited the kinase activity of mitogen-activated protein
kinase 4 (MKK4/MAP2K4/MEK4)9, in turn inhibiting down-
stream phosphorylation of p38 MAPK7 and of heat-shock protein
27 (HSP27)14. This translated into inhibition of MMP-2 expres-
sion and cell invasion in vitro, inhibition of human PCa metas-
tasis in mice8 and decreased MMP-2 expression in human
prostate tissue9. In contrast to genistein, KBU2046 did not bind
to MKK4 nor inhibit its kinase activity in vitro, and it did not
inhibit downstream phosphorylation of p38 MAPK or of HSP27
in cells (Supplementary Fig. 9). This finding, while surprising,
demonstrates that our chemical probe strategy de-selected for
inhibition of the MKK4 signaling axis. Importantly, this provides
a measure of the unbiased nature of our chemical probe strategy.
Seeking to identify KBU2046’s biological target(s), we pursued
alternative methods. The KinomeView® panel of antibodies (Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc.) detect established protein phosphor-
ylation motifs, and were used to probe for KBU2046-induced
changes in protein phosphorylation (Fig. 4a and Supplementary
Fig. 10). We prioritized phosphoprotein changes that met the
following criteria: were induced in cells in vitro as well as in
tumors of treated mice (from Fig. 2a), that counteracted
transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced effects, and that
were reproducible. TGFβ is ubiquitous in vivo, is known to
increase PCa cell invasion7, and KBU2046’s anti-invasion efficacy
remains in spite of TGFβ-stimulated increases in cell invasion
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Genistein was evaluated under identical
treatment conditions for comparison. Genistein’s many pharma-
cologic effects induced widespread changes in protein phosphor-
ylation (Supplementary Fig. 10). In contrast, KBU2046 induced
only a single change that met our pre-specified criteria, i.e., a
decrease in intensity of an 83 kDa protein band (blue arrow in
Fig. 4a). In tumors of treated animals, KBU2046 had this same
effect on this 83 kDa protein band (green arrow in Supplementary
Fig. 10a). The high molecular selectivity of KBU2046 was further
supported by its failure to inhibit over 400 different protein
kinases and 20 phosphatases examined, in three different in vitro
assay systems (Supplementary Note 2).
The 83 kDa protein was identified by pretreating PC3 cells with
KBU2046 or vehicle control, treating with TGFβ and performing
LC-MS/MS analysis on proteins pulled down by the Kinome-
View® antibody used in Fig. 4a. Resultant data were analyzed with
the SEQUEST/Sorcerer data analysis suite, and proteins further
selected based upon predetermined parameters (Supplementary
Fig. 12). This approach yielded a single protein, HSP90β, and
indicated that KBU2046 decreased the abundance of phosphory-
lated Ser226 on HSP90β by 6.6-fold (Fig. 4b and Supplementary
Fig. 12).
The
(S226A)-HSP90β
construct
lacks
a
Ser226
residue,
precluding phosphorylation at that site, represents a constitutive
inactive mimic, and mimics the effect of KBU246 on that residue
(i.e., dephosphorylation). As expected, transfection of cells with
(S226A)-HSP90β inhibited cell invasion, compared to vector
control (VC) transfected cells (Fig. 4c). Further, if KBU2046 were
exerting efficacy by inhibiting phosphorylation of the Ser226
residue, then removal of that residue should, by definition,
preclude additional efficacy. This is exactly what is observed: in
(S226A)-HSP90β transfected cells, KBU2046 does not further
inhibit cell invasion, while it significantly inhibits invasion in VC
cells (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 13a). The selectivity of
HSP90β in mediating KBU2046 efficacy was further supported by
demonstrating that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated
HSP90β knockdown inhibited cell invasion and abrogated
KBU2046 efficacy (Supplementary Fig. 13b–d). HSP90β-specific
siRNA did not knockdown HSP90α (Supplementary Fig. 13b).

 Conversely, the pseudophosphorylated (S226D)-HSP90β con-
struct contains a residue that provides a biological mimic of
phosphorylated Ser226, and as such constitutes a constitutively
active mutant. As expected, cells transfected with (S226D)-
HSP90β were more invasive than VC cells (Fig. 4d). Recognizing
that pseudophosphorylated constructs only serve to mimic
activated wild-type protein, it was not surprising that (S226D)-
HSP90β cells were not as invasive as WT-HSP90β cells. More
importantly, if KBU2046 were exerting efficacy by inhibiting
phosphorylation of the Ser226 residue, then the presence of a
phospho-mimic residue should, by definition, decrease additional
efficacy. This is exactly what is observed: in (S226D)-HSP90β
transfected cells, KBU2046 did not significantly inhibit cell
invasion, while it significantly inhibited invasion in both VC and
WT-HSP90β cells (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 13). These
findings demonstrate that changes in the phosphorylation status
of Ser226 on HSP90β can be altered by a small molecule, and
appear to be associated with selective inhibition of cancer cell
motility by KBU2046.
KBU2046

function.
KBU2046’s effect upon HSP90β function is completely different
from that of classical HSP90 inhibitors. The latter induce cyto-
toxicity and work by binding directly to HSP90, thereby
inhibiting its enzyme activity, in turn affecting the function of
large numbers of cellular kinases and other client proteins15. In
contrast, KBU2046 was not cytotoxic and its effects on protein
phosphorylation were highly specific, demonstrating a lack of
effects on kinase function. HSP90β is part of a large multiprotein
chaperone complex whose function involves binding a large but
specific set of regulatory proteins. We reasoned that KBU2046
was changing the signature of bound client proteins, that the
change was highly selective in terms of number of affected pro-
teins, and that it was highly specific for proteins that regulate cell
motility.
CDC37 is a co-chaperone that mediates the binding of over 350
client proteins to HSP90β, including over 190 kinases16. CDC37
is a flexible arm-like structure (protein data bank (PDB) ID:
2WOG), is highly dynamic17, enables binding of large numbers of
kinases, defines their positioning and thereby their potential to
affect

status.
We
reasoned
that
KBU2046 was binding to either CDC37 or HSP90β, that this
altered the function of the CDC37/HSP90β heterocomplex
resulting in a change in the spectrum of bound client kinase
proteins, that changes were highly selective and that this altered
binding spectrum would in turn be responsible for KBU2046’s
effects upon cell motility.
There was no evidence of KBU2046 binding to either CDC37
or HSP90β by biophysical methods, inclusive of isothermal

associate to form a heterocomplex17, we went on to combine
CDC37 and HSP90β in a DARTS assay, demonstrating that
KBU2046 protected both proteins from digestion (Fig. 5a). The
intensity of the CDC37 band increased, that of the HSP90β
degradation product decreased, and both effects were statistically
significant, concentration-dependent, and were evident at 10 nM.
Further, the high selectivity of KBU2046 for protein binding was
additionally supported by synthesizing a biotin chemical linker to
KBU2046, demonstrating that it retained biological activity, that
it bound to intact cells (i.e., under physiological conditions of
CDC37/HSP90β heterocomplex formation), and that it failed to
bind to an array of over 9000 human proteins (Supplementary
Fig. 15). Together, these findings demonstrate that KBU2046 will
not bind to either CDC37 or HSP9Oβ, but that it will only bind
when both proteins are present and able to form heterocom-
plexes. Further, all findings also indicate that KBU2046 is not
acting as a classical HSP90 inhibitor. Classical HSP90 inhibitors
bind isolated HSP90, without the need for co-chaperones being
present,
are
characterized
by
their
cytotoxic
effects,
are
systemically toxic, particularly to the liver, and broadly inhibit
client kinase protein binding, thereby exerting widespread effects
upon cellular signaling and affecting a wide array of cellular
processes15. In contrast, KBU2046 exhibits a complete lack of
cellular cyctotoxicity and systemic toxicity, everts highly specific
effects in both molecular-based protein phosphorylation, and
cellular-based functional assays and will not bind HSP90 in
isolation.
These combined experiments indicate that KBU2046 only
binds to HSP90β and CDC37 when both proteins are present,
does not bind to either protein alone, and together support the

experimental
structural
information,
including X-ray crystallographic data (PDB IDs: 1uym, 3nmq,
3pry, 2cg9, and 1us7) and chemical cross-linker physical mapping
analysis19, supports the notion that CDC37/HSP90β heterocom-
plex formation results in the formation of a new pocket, that is
located at the interface of the two proteins. These modeling
studies also predict that KBU2046 binds without any high-energy
steric interactions, and with a favorable energy score (Fig. 5b–d
and Supplementary Fig. 16). In this computational arrangement,
Arg167 from CDC37 protrudes into a large cleft, engages in a
hydrogen bond with the carboxyl side chain of Glu33 from
HSP90β, which promotes the formation of a new pocket, into
which KBU2046 binds.
Together, these findings suggest that KBU2046 binds the
CDC37/HSP90β heterocomplex. To examine whether this is
associated with an altered signature of bound client kinase
proteins, we performed a modified LUMIER assay16 to detect
KBU2046-induced changes in client protein binding to CDC37/
HSP90β heterocomplexes in intact cells. Of 420 kinase proteins
screened, KBU2046 had highly selective effects, significantly
changing the binding of only 17 (4%): binding was increased in
10 and decreased in 7 (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 17a). These
findings are in contrast to classical inhibitors of HSP90 function,
which have been shown, through this same assay, to affect the
binding of the majority client kinase proteins16. Given that TGFβ
increases cell motility and that KBU2046 efficacy remains in the
face of TGFβ treatment (Supplementary Fig. 11), we repeated the
LUMIER assay in TGFβ-treated cells, identifying 3 kinases whose
binding to complexes was significantly affected by KBU2046:
RAF1
(decreased
binding),
RIPKI
(decreased),
and
SGK3
(increased) (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 17a). All three
proteins have been shown by others to regulate cell motility, and
we demonstrate that knockdown of any one of them decreases
motility (Fig. 6c, d and Supplementary Fig. 17b–d). However,
only knockdown of RAF1 or of RIPK1 (i.e., the two kinases whose
binding to the heterocomplex was decreased by KBU2046)
mitigated KBU2046 efficacy, while KBU2046 still retained efficacy
in the face of SGK3 knockdown.
DARTS assay findings (Fig. 5a) supported the notion of a
direct interaction. However, the LUMIER-based approach used
intact cells treated for 3 days and was unable to determine
whether KBU2046 was directly interacting with heterocomplexes.
Additional studies were therefore undertaken. Studies focused on
RAF1. RAF1 is known to regulate cell motility and metastasis in
several cancer types20, while KBU2046’s effect upon RIPK1-
complex binding was minor and not further enhanced by TGFβ.
KBU2046 did not alter RAF1 protein expression levels in cells
(Fig. 6c). This is significant in that HSP90 inhibitors broadly
inhibit chaperone activity, thereby decreasing client protein
expression. We next constructed an in vitro kinase assay of
purified recombinant RAF1, HSP90β, and CDC37, and demon-
strated that KBU2046 decreased phosphorylation of RAF1’s
Ser338 activation motif (Fig. 6e). In the absence of CDC37/
HSP90β heterocomplex, RAF1 activity was much lower, indicat-
ing that this effect is heterocomplex-dependent (Supplementary
Fig. 18).

 phosphorylation resulted from changes in the signature of bound
client kinases to the heterocomplex. We examined this by
considering that in intact cells KBU2046 increased SGK3 binding
to the heterocomplex (Fig. 6a), an effect we anticipated may in
turn phosphorylate HSP90β. Utilizing our in vitro kinase assay,
we demonstrated that SGK3 increased phosphorylation of
HSP90β, and that phosphorylation was further increased in the
presence of KBU2046 (Fig. 6f). Recognizing the complexity of the
system and the dynamic nature of the client-chaperone complex,
we suspected that KBU2046-mediated inhibition of HSP90β
phosphorylation was not an isolated event (i.e., not mediated by a
single kinase operating in isolation). We explored this possibility

 in our in vitro system by investigating the interplay of multiple
kinases. In intact cells, KBU2046 increases MAP3K6 binding to
complexes (Fig. 6a), but MAP3K6 is not predicted to phosphor-
ylate the Ser226 motif. We went on to demonstrate that when
MAP3K6 is added to the in vitro kinase assay system, SGK3-
mediated phosphorylation of HSP90β is not only inhibited, but in
fact decreases in the presence of KBU2046 (Fig. 6g), emulating
what is seen in intact cells.
Discussion
The knowledge that increased cancer cell motility drives devel-
opment of metastasis and that metastasis is responsible for the
majority of cancer-related mortality has pushed the research
community to identify regulators of these processes. A wide array
of pathways has been shown to affect these processes. However,
the identification of specific regulatory processes has been elusive,
which has served as a roadblock to therapeutic modulation4,5.
Our study deployed a natural product-inspired molecular
probe strategy to address this longstanding problem. That strat-
egy used efficient synthesis routes to generate small molecules,
which were then used as biological probes. We thereby went on to
demonstrate that precision modulation of cell motility could be
achieved by selectively changing the signature of client kinase
proteins bound to the HSP90β/CDC37 heterocomplex. Further,
we demonstrate enrichment for changes in bound client kinase
proteins that affect motility. We subsequently demonstrate that in
the context of this altered binding signature that one of the
affected client proteins, RAF1, plays an important role in med-
iating KBU2046 efficacy. These findings constitute a unique and
specific regulatory mechanism for human cancer cell motility,
and resultant downstream effects upon metastasis, end organ
destruction, and survival.
In parallel with our identification of this regulatory mechan-
ism, our studies provide for a small molecule, KBU2046, that can
both serve as a biological probe and as a systemically active
therapeutic. Activity is demonstrated across different cancer types
and across different clinically relevant systemic models. Further, a
comprehensive characterization of pharmacology and toxicity
support practical therapeutic application.
Coincident with affecting the bound signature of client pro-
teins, we also inhibit post-translational changes to HSP90β. They
include a decrease in its phosphorylation status, with several of
our findings pointing to phosphorylation of Ser226 as being
particularly important. We recognize that there are a relatively
high number of potential phosphorylation sites on HSP90β and
that the antibody used to probe phosphorylation cannot be
considered specific for the Ser226 motif. However, our investiga-
tions involving point mutations at that site and our phospo-
proteomics evaluation of proteins bound to the antibody do
provide supportive evidence to speculate that this site is of reg-
ulatory importance.
Of high importance, KBU2046 lacked all of the hallmarks of
classical HSP90 inhibitors. Specifically, KBU2046 was not cyto-
toxic, lacked systemic toxicity, did not decrease expression of
client proteins, and it did not broadly alter kinase function.
Further, KBU2046 only bound to HSP90β and CDC37 when both
proteins were present and able to form heterocomplexes, and
would not bind to HSP90β as an isolated protein nor to CDC37
as an isolated protein. This is in contrast to classical HSP90
inhibitors, which are characterized by their ability to bind HSP90
as an isolated protein.
We go on to present a structural model in which KBU2046
binds within a cleft that is created through the binding of HSP90
and CDC37, and exists at the interface between these two pro-
teins. While our model integrates information from physical
mapping, biochemical analysis, and crystallographic structure, its
final construct was in silico, and it should therefore be considered
speculative. Several other models also describe the structure of
HSP90/CDC37 interactions21,22. Those models differ from each
other, and from ours. For example, our model integrated infor-
mation from physical mapping (based on chemical cross linkers),
from structural information reported in the literature, from our
findings implicating KBU2046 interaction with HSP90/CDC37
heterocomplexes, and only took into consideration hetero-
complex structure (i.e., in the absence of bound client proteins).
In contrast, one recent model used cyroEM to evaluate HSP90/
CDC37 heterocomplex structure in the context of its binding to
the CDK4 client protein21. There are many other potential
explanations. It is likely that each model describes a particular
state, and different states are possible. Our model should there-
fore be considered a speculative framework from which future
studies can be launched. Future investigations will need to be
performed in order to determine the effects of bound vs. unbound
client protein, different client proteins, binding of small molecules
to the HSP90/CDC37 heterocomplex structure, and the ultimate
validity of each of these models.
From our findings, we propose an integrated structural and
functional model. KBU2046 binds to a cleft that is formed when
HSP90β and CDC37 bind to form a heterocomplex. This in turn
affects the ability of the hetercomplex to bind client kinase pro-
teins in a very precise manner, selectively affecting those that
regulate cell motility. Of these, RAF1 is of particular importance.
KBU2046 decreases RAF1 binding to the heterocomplex, result-
ing in decreased activation, and inhibition of cell motility.
KBU2046’s precision type of effect on chaperone function dif-
ferentiates it from classical HSP90 inhibitors, which broadly
disrupt client protein function, and underlie KBU2046’s lack of
toxicity and selective modulation of cell motility.
Together, the findings of this study provide a rational platform
to move investigations into humans. That platform includes
mechanistic strategy and the physical tools with which to affect it.
Also, this study provides proof of principle findings that through

 modulation of the signature of client protein binding to chaper-
one scaffold proteins, in turn resulting in highly selective func-
tional effects at the cellular and systemic level. In parallel, this
approach serves to inform us about novel pathways for regulating
critical biological processes. Finally, our approach that coupled
efficient chemical synthesis routes with a well-designed pheno-
typic screening strategy has the potential to be broadly applied as
a tool to interrogate other critical biological processes.

flavanone (KBU2046):
3-(dimethylamino)-1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one.
The starting materials 2′-hydroxyacetophenone (50 mmol, 6.02 mL) and N,N-
dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (50 mmol, 6.64 mL) were added to a 10–20 mL
microwave vial. The vial was capped and heated in a Biotage Initiator microwave
synthesizer at 150 °C and 11 bar for 10 min. The resulting dark orange liquid was
allowed to cool to 23 °C, at which time yellow–orange crystals crashed out of solution.
The crystals were collected and washed with hexanes (50 mL), then dried and weighed
to give 3-(dimethylamino)-1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (9.09 g, 95%) as

3-bromochromone.
3-bromochromone was prepared by a procedure taken from Gammill23. To a
flame-dried 250 mL round bottom flask, was added 3-(dimethylamino)-1-(2-
hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (36.6 mmol, 7.0 g), which was dissolved in CHCl3
(70 mL). The reaction flask was cooled to 0 °C in an ice bath, then Br2 (36.6 mmol,
1.87 mL) was added dropwise through an addition funnel. After all of the Br2 was
added, water (70 mL) was added slowly to the reaction and it was stirred at 23 °C
for 10 min. The dark orange–yellow organic layer was then separated from the
aqueous layer, which was back-extracted with 3 × 50 mL CHCl3. The combined
organic layers were then dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to give a dark orange
oil. This was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2, 10% EtOAc/hexanes)
to afford 3-bromochromone (5.26 g, 64%) as an off-white solid. Analytical data for
3-bromochromone: 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.31 (dd, J = 8.0, 1.7 Hz, 1 H),

UPLCMS: mass calculated for C9H5BrO2, [M + H]+, 226. Found 226.
Palladium tetrakis (triphenylphosphine) (Pd(PPh3)4). The catalyst for the
Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction to synthesize 4′-fluoroisoflavone was
made using a procedure by Coulson24. To a flame-dried 100 mL Schlenk flask was
added PdCl2 (5 mmol, 890 mg) and triphenylphosphine (25 mmol, 6.56 g). The
solids were dissolved in DMSO (60 mL), then the mixture was purged with N2 and
heated to 145 °C, at which time it turned a bright yellow–orange color. The reaction
was removed from heat and allowed to stir at room temperature for 15 min, then
hydrazine hydrate (20 mmol, 0.972 mL) was added via syringe, with a vent needle
in place to account for the formation of N2 gas. After the hydrazine hydrate had
been added, the reaction was cooled to 23 °C, during which time a yellow solid
crashed out of solution. The solid was washed under Schlenk filtration conditions
with 2 × 50 mL EtOH, then 2 × 50 mL ether to yield Pd(PPh3)4 (5.31 g, 94%) as a
canary yellow solid that was stored under N2 in the glovebox.
4′-fluoroisoflavone.
4′-fluoroisoflavone was prepared on large scale according to a procedure from
Suzuki and Miyaura25. To a flame-dried 500 mL round bottom flask was added 3-
bromochromone (50 mmol, 11.25 g), 4-fluorophenylboronic acid (55 mmol, 7.69
g), and Na2CO3 (100 mmol, 10.6 g). The solids were dissolved in a mixture of
benzene (100 mL) and water (50 mL), and the system was purged with N2 for 10-
15 min. The Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst (2.5 mmol, 2.89 g) was then added, at which time
the reaction turned a bright orange. The flask was equipped with a reflux condenser
and the reaction was heated to reflux (80 °C) overnight. After ~16 h, the reaction
was cooled to 23 °C and was diluted with EtOAc (250 mL), then the crude material
was passed through a plug of silica with EtOAc as the eluent. The organic material
was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to give a dark brown solid that was
adsorbed onto silica gel using DCM. Material purified by flash column
chromatography (SiO2, 20% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford 4′-fluoroisoflavone (8.14 g,
67% yield) as a yellow–orange solid that showed minor impurities by 1H NMR
spectroscopy. Slightly impure material was taken onto the next step of the synthesis
without further purification. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.35 (dd, J = 8.0, 1.6
Hz, 1 H), 8.05 (s, 1 H), 7.73 (ddd, J = 8.7, 7.1, 1.7 Hz, 1 H), 7.61–7.54 (m, 2 H), 7.53

[M + H]+, 241. Found 241.
4′-fluoroisoflavanone (KBU2046).
The reaction conditions to synthesize 4′-fluoroisoflavanone on large scale were
adapted from a procedure reported by Wähälä26. To a flame-dried 500 mL round
bottom flask was added 4′-fluoroisoflavone (25 mmol, 6.01 g), and the solid was
dissolved in dry THF (100 mL). The solution was cooled to −78 °C (dry ice/acetone
bath), monitored by a thermocouple. Once the solution had cooled to the desired
temperature, L-selectride (55 mmol, 55 mL, 1 M solution in THF) was added
dropwise over a period of 30–45 min. The reaction was then allowed to stir at −78 °
C for 2 h, after which time it was quenched with MeOH (55 mL) at −78 °C. The
mixture was then poured into 300 mL of water, and the aqueous layer was adjusted
to pH 7 with 2 M HCl. The aqueous layer was extracted 2 × 200 mL with EtOAc,
then the combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to give
a dark brown oily solid. This was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2,
1:1 hexanes:DCM) to give 4.5 g of crude material that was recrystallized in hexanes
to afford 4′-fluoroisoflavanone (3.4 g, 56%) as a fluffy white solid. It was checked for
purity by both 1H NMR and HPLC analysis, with material that was >98% pure
taken onto animal studies. Analytical data for isoflavanone 4′-fluoroisoflavanone:
1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.98 (dd, J = 7.9, 1.7 Hz, 1 H), 7.55 (ddd, J = 8.6, 7.1,
1.7 Hz, 1 H), 7.33–7.24 (m, 1 H), 7.14–6.99 (m, 4 H), 4.77–4.54 (m, 2 H), 4.02 (dd, J
= 9.0, 5.3 Hz, 1 H); 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3) δ 192.0, 163.3, 161.5, 136.2, 130.7,
130.2, 127.8, 121.8, 120.9, 117.9, 115.8, 71.4, 51.5; UPLCMS: mass calculated for
C15H11FO2, [M + H]+, 243. Found 243.
Synthesis of additional compounds. A series of related analog compounds was
synthesized in addition to the parent 4′-fluoroisoflavanone (KBU2046). These
compounds were prepared in the same general manner of KBU2046 and the
structures of each such compound are depicted in supplementary figures. The
structure and purity of the additional analogs were confirmed by NMR
spectroscopy (1H and 13 C) as well as by UPLCMS (minimal ion fragmentation).
All compounds were isolated and stored in powdered form (in the absence of light)
and were formulated into DSMO stock solutions just prior to use.
Cell culture and reagents. PCa (PC3, LNCaP, and DU145), breast cancer (MDA-
MB-231 and MCF-7), colon cancer (HCT110 and HT29), and lung cancer cells
(H226 and A549) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and not
further authenticated. The origin, characteristics, for PC3-M, as well as for human
papilloma virus (HPV) transformed primary 1532NPTX (normal), 1532CPTX
(cancer), 1542NPTX (normal), and 1542CP3TX (cancer) cell lines, have previously
been described by us27. The origin of the stable polyclonal HEK293T cell lines
expressing Renilla-HSP90β were previously described16. LM2-4H2N human breast
cancer metastatic variant cells were derived from MDA-MB-231 cells as descri-
bed28, and the tdTomato-Luc2-expressing cell line was established by transduction
of these cells with a lentiviral vector encoding fluorescent (tdTomato) and biolu-
minescent (Luc2) genes as described29. All cells were cultured as described27,28,
were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide with
biweekly media changes, were drawn from stored stock cells, and replenished on a
standardized periodic basis and were routinely monitored for Mycoplasma (Plas-
moTest™, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA), at least every 3 months. Cells were
authenticated by the following: they were acquired from the originator of that line,
grown under quarantine conditions, expanded and stored as primary stocks and
not used until following conditions were met: mycoplasma negative; through
morphologic examination; growth characteristics; hormone responsiveness or lack
thereof, when applicable; replenished from primary stocks at least every 3 months;
working with a single primary stock cell line at a time with hood sterilization in
between.

Millipore; #17-360), MAP3K6 (Abnova; #P5592), and SGK3 (Thermo Scientific;
#PV3859).
Cell invasion assays. Boyden chamber cell invasion assays were performed as
previously described by us30, using either denatured collagen (BD Biosciences) or
type IV human collagen (BD Biosciences), with all experiments repeated, each in N
= 4 replicates. In some experiments, as indicated, cells were transfected with an
expression plasmid, using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen), or with siRNA, using
DharmaFect Duo (Thermo Scientific) and co-transfected with β-Galactosidase
(Plasmid pCMV•SPORT-βgal; Life Technology).
Cell growth inhibition assays. Three-day MTT cell growth inhibition assays were
performed as described by us31. Assays were in replicates of N = 3, and were
repeated.
Western blots. Western blots were performed as described by us32. All western
blots were repeated at least once. Uncropped scans of the most important blots are
depicted in Supplementary Fig. 19.
Cell migration assays. Single-cell motility assays were conducted by adding 104
cells to 35 mm tissue culture dishes (BD Falcon) coated with collagen I (BD
Biosciences), incubating at 37 °C in 5% CO2, performing time-lapse imaging using
a Biostation (Nikon Instruments), tracking the path of N ≥ 35 cells using ImageJ
software and the Manual Tracker plug-in, and using Chemotaxis and Migration
Tool plug-in for data analysis.
Scratch wound assays. Cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA constructs
per manufacture protocol (GE-Dharmacon), cultured 48 h with 10 µM KBU2046
or vehicle, and scratch wound assay performed as described by us33. All experi-
ments were conducted in N = 4 replicates, and repeated.

gifts: constitutive active MEK4EE (MAP2K4-EE; residues 37-399; Addgene, plas-
mid 14813), pRL-TK-Renilla luciferase (Promega), pCMV-β-galactosidase (Agilent
Technologies), and pcDNA-GFP (Invitrogen), HSP90β was from Pawel Biega-
nowski (Mossakowski Medical Research Center PAS, Poland)34, estrogen-
responsive promoter-luciferase reporter construct, pERE-Luc, was from Craig
Jordan (Georgetown University)35, human CDC37 in pET15b plasmid was from
Avrom Caplan (City College of New York)36. siRNA used Dharmacon ON-
Targetplus SMARTpool™ siRNA directed against HSP90β (cat # L-005187-00-
0010) non-targeting siRNA (cat # D-001810-10-05) used TransIT-LT1 Transfec-
tion Reagent (Mirus Bio LLC), or with Dharmafect Duo (Thermo Scientific,
Lafayette, CO) for co-delivery of plasmid. Luciferase assays were performed as
described by us30.
Animal models of metastasis and of systemic effects. All animal studies
adhered to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, were
treated under institutional IACUC-approved protocols by Oregon Health and
Sciences University and Northwestern University, complied with all federal, state,
and local ethical regulations, housed in barrier (for immunocompromised mice) or
conventional facilities, with a 12-h light/dark cycle and given soy-free food and
water ad libitum. Animal study sample size determination: sample sizes were
determined using the samples size estimation formula for differences in means with
power set 80%, two-sided α = 0.05, and a pre-specified effect size of 30%.
Prostate cancer: orthotopic implantation: Orthotopic implantation of human
GFP-PC3-M PCa cells into 6–8 week male Balb/c athymic mice (Charles River
Laboratories) and quantification of distant metastasis was performed as described
by us37. Treatment with KBU2046, incorporated into Harlan Teklad 2016S® chow,
began 1 week prior to implantation. Animals were excluded from the analysis if
they died and/or met the criteria for killing in the 7 day post-operative period.
Experimental groups were randomly assigned to cages prior to the initiation of the
study. Metastasis were scored in a blinded fashion. Specifically, animals were
assigned an ID number, resultant histologic slides contained a separate pathological
ID number, slides were scored in a random fashion, after which the two numbers
were linked up.
Breast cancer: orthotopic implantation: Orthotopic implantation of 2 × 106
dTomato-LM2-4H2N cells in matrigel:PBS human breast cancer cells into
5–6 week old female SCID-Beige mice (Taconic), followed by resection of resultant
primary tumor, provides a model wherein survival is dictated by metastatic burden,
and was performed as described12. KBU2046 treatment by oral gavage 5 days per
week began 4 weeks after resection, with weekly IVIS imaging. Animals were
excluded from the analysis if they died and/or met the criteria for euthanasia in the
7 day post-operative period. Experimental groups were randomly assigned based
upon size of primary tumor before treatment, in and manner that ensured equal
distribution of tumor sizes across treatment groups.
Prostate cancer: intracardiac (IC) injection: IC injection of 4.0 × 105 PC3-Luc
cells into male 6–8 week old athymic mice with IVIS imaging was performed as
described13, and was done so under ultrasound guidance (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Mice were treated pre- and/or post-IC injection, as indicated. The pretreatment
cohort emulates a metastasis naive model wherein cell motility is required in order
for cells to invade into a distant organ, in this case, the jaw bone, for which this
model is widely used. If KBU2046 were inhibiting cell motility, then in this model it
would act to inhibit metastasis formation. In contrast, with the post-implantation
cohort, cells have already completed invasion into the jaw bone, and distant
metastasis have been established. If KBU2046 were only inhibiting cell motility,
then in this model, it should exhibit no efficacy. IVIS imaging was performed 30
min after IC injection to confirm systemic distribution of cells, and thereafter
weekly for 4 weeks starting 7 days post injection, allowing real-time tracking of
metastasis development and growth. Computed tomograpgy (CT) (Inveon,
Seimens) radiographic imaging was performed on some mice, as indicated, and
resultant images analyzed in a blinded fashion using Inveon Research Workplace
4.2 visualization/analysis software and ImageJ. Animals were excluded from the
analysis if 30 min post-injection IVIS imaging revealed a focal signal in the chest
indicating a failed injection where cells were not distributed into circulation.
Experimental groups were randomly assigned to cages prior to the initiation of the
study. CT images were analyzed in a blinded fashion to determine total bone loss
using both the Invenon Research Workplace 4.2 visualization/analysis software and
ImageJ. Specifically, to asses bone loss in an unbiased manner, an operator
randomly loaded images into the system and blocked out identifying information
prior to analysis by two separate blinded individuals.
Systemic effects: Off-target effects were sought by performing histologic
examination of tissue and by measuring organ function.
Histologic examination of tissue: Organs of athymic male mice stained with
hematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, or giemsa were microscopically examined by a
mouse pathologist (L.L.) in a blinded fashion, and toxicity scored using an
established semi-quantitative histological scoring system38 (Supplementary Fig. 8).
The following clinical chemistry parameters were measured in blood of CD1 male
and female mice by Charles River Research Animal Diagnostic Services:
cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase,
total bilirubin, glucose, phosphorus, total protein, calcium, blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), creatinine, albumin, Na, K, Cl, white blood cells (with differential), red
blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets.
Hematopoietic stem cell colony formation assay. Fourteen-day colony forma-
tion assays were conducted as described by us39, using human cord blood CD34+
stem cells (AllCells Inc.), using MethoCultExpress™ colony growth media (StemCell
Technologies Inc.), performed in replicates of N = 2.
KBU2046 quantification and pharmacokinetics. For determination of pharma-
cokinetic (PK) parameters, KBU2046 was administered by either intravenous
injection or oral gavage to groups of N = 3 CD1(ICR) mice at 0 (i.e., vehicle only),
25, or 100 mg/kg. Blood was collected into EDTA by terminal cardiac puncture
before drug administration (i.e., baseline) and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180,
240, 360, 480, 960, 1440 min after administration. In separate experiments, as
described above, Balb/c athymic mice were dosed with KBU2046 incorporated into
chow for 35 days, after which blood was collected by terminal cardiac puncture.
Resultant plasma (~250 μl/mouse) was stored at −80 °C.
Plasma KBU2046 concentrations were measured in duplicate by liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after sample preparation by solid-
phase extraction. Specifically, 0.1 mL of a sample, 10 μL of 0.1 μg/mL internal
standard solution (3-(2-chlorophenyl)-(4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, a chloride analog
of KBU2046), 3800 μL of water, and 10 μl of 85% phosphoric acid were added,
vortexed, and stored at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing a 96-well Strata-X 33 µm
polymeric reversed phase 30 mg/well solid-phase extraction plate (Phenomenex)
with methanol and water, sample was applied, washed with 20% methanol in water,
eluted with 70% acetonitrile/30% methanol, dried at 50 °C under N2, reconstituted
with 100 μL of mobile phase, and 20 µL was analyzed on an API 3000 liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system (Applied Biosystems) with an
Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies). Samples were eluted
isocratically from a Synergi 4-μm MAX-RP 100 Å column (2.0 × 50 mm;
Phenomenex) by a mobile phase consisting of 10 mM ammonium formate in water
and methanol (30:70 [vol/vol]) at a flow rate of 0.20 mL/min. The tandem mass
spectrometer was operated with its electrospray source in the positive ionization
mode. The mass-to-charge ratios of the precursor-to-product ion reactions
monitored were 243.5 → 125.1 for KBU2046 and 257.0 → 165.0 for the internal
standard. The retention time of KBU2046 was ~2.7 min while that of the internal
standard was ~2.3 min. The linear range for plasma KBU2046 standard curves was
0.1–25.0 ng/mL, with coefficients of variation of 10% or less throughout the entire
concentration range. Fresh plasma standard curves were prepared in blank plasma
and run on the day of analysis of plasma samples.
Plasma KBU2046 concentration vs. time relationships after both intravenous
and oral drug administration were modeled simultaneously using the SAAM II
software system (SAAM Institute), implemented on a WindowsTM-based PC (see
PK modeling schema). Plasma concentrations were modeled with a three-
compartment PK model using a naive pooled data approach40. Oral drug
absorption was characterized by a tanks-in-series delay element, to account for the
non-instantaneous appearance of drug in the body. Simultaneous estimation of PK

 model parameters for both routes of administration permitted estimation of the
bioavailability of the orally administered drug (F)41. The SAAM II objective
function used was the extended least-squares maximum likelihood function using
data weighted with the inverse of the model-based variance of the data at the
observation times42. Model misspecification was sought by visual inspection of the
measured and predicted marker concentrations vs. time relationships (Fig. 7)42.
Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. RNA was isolated and qRT-PCR was
performed as described by us43, analyzed by the 2−ΔΔCt method44, using primer/
probes sets (ABI), HSP90α (Hs00743767_sH), HSP90β (Hs00427665_g1), trefoil
factor 1 (TFF1; Hs00907239_m1), cathepsin D (CTSD; Hs00157205_m1), pro-
gesterone receptor (PGR; Hs01556702_m1), and GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1).
Assays were repeated, each in replicates of N = 2.
Biophysical and biochemical binding assays. Fluorescent thermal shift45, iso-
thermal titration calorimetry19, and biolayer interferometry assays46 were all per-
formed as described by us using MEK4EE (37-399, S257E, T261E) cloned into
pMCSG7 and KRX Competent E. coli cells (Promega Inc.) and above denoted full-
length HSP90B and CDC37 vectors and Rosetta BL-21 and BL-21 DE-3 competent
E. coli cells, respectively. DARTS assays were conducted as described18, using
equimolar amounts of CDC37 and HSP90β, thermolysin digestion, and silver stain
visualization (ProteoSilver Silver Stain Kit, Sigma-Aldrich).
In vitro kinase assays. MEK4/MKK4/MAP2K4 in vitro kinase assay was per-
formed as described by us45. HSP90β/CDC37 heterocomplex kinase assays with
RAF1, SGK3, and MAP3K6 assays incubated indicated proteins in 20 mM MOPS,
pH 7.2, 25 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate,
1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 mM ATP, and 37.5 mM MgCl2 at 30 °C for the indicated
times.
Phospho-proteomic analysis. The Kinoview™ and PhosphoScan™ assays were
performed by Cell Signaling Technology Inc.
Protein microarray binding assay. The ProtoArray® assay, using the Human
Protein Microarray platform, was performed by Invitrogen.
High-performance molecular modeling platform. Modeling and docking used
the APPLIED Pipeline (Analysis Pipeline for Protein Ligand Interactions and
Experimental Determination) at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility,
Argonne National Laboratory, tuned for the 786,432 core BlueGene/Q Mira47,
using a multi-stage pipeline that considers protein–protein/ligand interactions
through evolutionary protein surface analysis48–50, robust homology modeling51,
massively parallel docking simulations using mixed strategies52–56, and advanced,
physics-based rescoring methodologies56–58, all as described by us.
LUMIER assay. The LUMIER assay was performed as described, using reagents
generously provided by that group16.
Statistical analysis. All results were analyzed by a dedicated statistician (B.J.).
Unless otherwise stated, statistical significance was evaluated with the two-sided
Student’s t-test using a threshold of P < 0.05. All experiments, unless otherwise
stated, were conducted in replicates of at least N = 2–6 (with specific N values are
denoted for each experiment) and were repeated at a separate time, also in replicates
of N = 2–6. The relationship between dose and metastasis, and between drug con-
centration and effect on protein degradation, was evaluated by two-sided analysis of
variance. The survival of mice was evaluated by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.

Fig. 7 Pharmacokinetic model of the disposition of orally and intravenously
administered KBU2046. Schematic depiction of the three-compartment
pharmacokinetic (PK) model used determine plasma KBU2046
concentration versus time relationships after intravenous (IV) or oral
administration. The rate constants kin and kout determine the fraction of the
drug absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability, Foral). Drug enters
the central compartment (central volume, VC) from which it equilibrates
with the rapidly equilibrating (fast volume, VF) and slowly equilibrating
(slow volume, VS) peripheral compartments at rates dictated by their
respective intercompartmental clearances (CiF and ClS). Drug is eliminated
from VC by elimination clearance (ClE).
