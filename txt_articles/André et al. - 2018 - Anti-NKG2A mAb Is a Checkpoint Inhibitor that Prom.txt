SUMMARY
Checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer
treatment. However, only a minority of patients
respond to these immunotherapies. Here, we report
that blocking the inhibitory NKG2A receptorenhances
tumor immunity by promoting both natural killer (NK)
and CD8+ T cell effector functions in mice and hu-
mans. Monalizumab, a humanized anti-NKG2A anti-
body, enhanced NK cell activity against various tumor
cells and rescued CD8+ T cell function in combination
with PD-x axis blockade. Monalizumab also stimu-
lated NK cell activity against antibody-coated target
cells. Interim results of a phase II trial of monalizumab
plus cetuximab in previously treated squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck showed a 31% objec-
tive response rate. Most common adverse events
were fatigue (17%), pyrexia (13%), and headache
(10%). NKG2A targeting with monalizumab is thus a
novel checkpoint inhibitory mechanism promoting
anti-tumor immunity by enhancing the activity of
both T andNK cells, which maycomplement first-gen-
eration immunotherapies against cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Immuno-oncology has revolutionized cancer treatment (Okazaki
and Honjo, 2007; Okazaki et al., 2013; Baumeister et al., 2016;
Schumacher and Schreiber, 2015; Sharma and Allison, 2015a,
2015b). Unprecedented improvements in tumor control have
been achieved using therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
that block immune inhibitory ‘‘checkpoint’’ receptors. In partic-
ular, mAbs directed against the PD-1 (programmed-cell death
protein 1)/PD-L1 (programmed -cell death ligand 1) axis (PDx) in
monotherapy or combination therapy have been approved for
the treatment of several indications, including metastatic mela-
noma, non-small-cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer,
Hodgkin lymphoma, and solid tumors that are microsatellite insta-
bility-high or mismatched repair-deficient (Okazaki and Honjo,
2007; Okazaki et al., 2013; Baumeister et al., 2016; Schumacher
and Schreiber, 2015; Sharma and Allison, 2015a, 2015b). Such
treatment often yields durable benefits, and, in most patients,
toxicity can be controlled. However, only a subset of the patients
treated with antibodies specific for PD-1 or PD-L1 display a
strong response, and the cancers of a substantial fraction of pa-
tients are resistant to these immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI).
Therefore, one of the major challenges in immuno-oncology is
understanding the mechanisms of resistance to ICI, to increase
the proportion of patients benefiting from such treatment and to
control treatment toxicity. One approach that could be used is
to identify novel molecular targets, the modulation of which
boosts anti-tumor immunity. Blocking other inhibitory pathways
of effector lymphocytes, such as T cells and NK cells, is attracting
considerable research interest in this context.
Cell surface receptors harboring intracytoplasmic tyrosine-
based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) are particularly relevant in this
respect. These motifs are phosphorylated and recruit the phos-
phatases (SHP-1/2 or SHIP) responsible for transmitting the
inhibition signal to immune effector cells (Dae
¨ ron et al., 2008).
Bioinformatics analyses of the human genome have predicted
the presence of more than 300 type I and type II integral mem-
brane proteins containing at least one ITIM domain (Dae
¨ ron
et al., 2008), but only a few of these receptors are currently tar-
geted in therapeutic approaches.

 NKG2A is an ITIM-bearing receptor expressed on both T and
NK cells. Approximately half of peripheral blood NK cells express
NKG2A (Andre
´ et al., 1999; Mahapatra et al., 2017; Manser and
Uhrberg, 2016) and its expression on NK cells can be upregu-
lated upon stimulation with cytokines, such as interleukin-15
(IL-15) (Brady et al., 2004; Mori et al., 1998). In healthy individ-
uals, around 5% of human peripheral blood CD8+ T cells express
cell-surface NKG2A at steady state, but this expression can be
upregulated by chronic antigenic stimulation (Bertone et al.,
1999; McMahon et al., 2002; Mingari et al., 1998; Sheu et al.,
2005). NKG2A is expressed at the cell surface as a heterodimer
with CD94 in humans and mice and recognizes the non-classical
class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) molecules
human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-E in humans and Qa-1b in
mice. Binding of NKG2A/CD94 to its cognate ligand inhibits
T and NK cell effector functions (Le Dre
´ an et al., 1998; Rapaport
et al., 2015). This inhibition is dependent on the recruitment of the
SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase to the tyrosine-phosphorylated
form of the ITIM in NKG2A (Viant et al., 2014).
Here, we show that NKG2A blockade enhances the anti-tumor
immunity mediated by NK and CD8+ T cells. We developed a hu-

RESULTS
NKG2A Blockade Promotes Anti-
tumor Immunity
We assessed the impact of NKG2A on
cytotoxic lymphocyte activity by using
BALB/c B cell lymphoma A20 cells, which
express the non-classical MHC-I Qa-1b molecule, the mouse ho-
molog of HLA-E, and generating the corresponding Qa-1b-
knockout cells (Figure S1A). The growth rates of parental and
Qa-1b-deficient A20 cells were similar in vitro (data not shown).
As expected, the frequency of activated NKG2A+ NK cells—as-
sessed based on the expression of CD107a, a degranulation
marker—was higher in cocultures with Qa-1b-deficient A20 cells
than in cocultures with parental cells (data not shown). Following
their subcutaneous injection into syngeneic BALB/c mice, wild-
type A20 B cell lymphoma cells progressively grew in all mice
(Figure 1A, left panel). By contrast, 70% of the mice into which
genetically engineered Qa-1b-deficient A20 cells were injected
did not display tumor growth (Figure 1A, right panel). Both NK
cells and CD8+ T cells were required to control tumor growth,
because the administration of anti-asialo-GM1 and anti-CD8a
mAbs, respectively, into tumor-bearing mice abolished the con-
trol of parental and Qa-1b-deficient tumor growth and led to pre-
mature death (Figures 1B and 1C). These results validate Qa-1b
as a potentially useful target.
We then dissected the immune response to A20 in the tumor
bed by analyzing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). A20

 tumors were found to be infiltrated by NK and CD8+ T cells.
�60% of tumor-infiltrating NK cells expressed the NKG2A re-
ceptor (Figure 2A). We also monitored PD-1 expression,
because the immune control of A20 tumors has been reported
to be partially dependent on PD-1 (Sagiv-Barfi et al., 2015). The
expression of PD-1, either alone or together with NKG2A, was
barely detectable on the surface of tumor-infiltrating NK cells.
We did not observe NKG2A expression on the surface of
CD8+ T cells from the spleen, and few cells expressed PD-1
(�0.5%) (Figure 2A). However, PD-1+ CD8+ T cells accounted
for �45% of TILs. Importantly, NKG2A was also expressed on
the surface of around half the PD-1+ CD8+ TILs. In this model,
we also observed that double-positive PD-1+ NKG2A+ CD8+
TILs displayed higher levels of PD-1 and NKG2A expression
at their surface than cells positive only for PD-1 or for NKG2A
(Figure 2A). Very few CD8+ TILs (�2%) expressed NKG2A
without PD-1.
We then investigated whether NKG2A blockade could pro-
mote anti-tumor immunity. We generated a recombinant mouse
version of the rat anti-mouse NKG2A antibody 20d5 (Vance et al.,
1999). We confirmed that the blockade of NKG2A in vitro pro-
moted the expression of CD107a by NK cells cocultured with
Qa-1B+ A20 tumors, but not with Qa-1B� YAC-1 target cells (Fig-
ure S1B). When used as single agents in vitro, anti-NKG2A and
anti-PD-L1 mAbs only modestly improved ex vivo tumor-infil-
trating CD8+ T cell effector activities after restimulation with

 A20 cells (Figure S1C). By contrast, the use of anti-NKG2A and
anti-PD-L1 mAbs in combination increased the frequency of
CD107a-expressing NKG2A+ PD-1+ CD8+ TILs.
We further investigated the effects of immunotherapy with anti-
NKG2Aandanti-PD-L1mAbs by treating A20tumor-bearingmice
with anti-NKG2A mAb, anti-PD-L1 mAb, or a combination of both
blocking reagents (Figure 2B). In this experimental setting, anti-
NKG2A mAb did not rescue mice from death when used as a
single agent when compared to control group. By contrast, anti-
PD-L1 mAb rescued �40% of tumor-bearing mice from death,
as shown by comparison with untreated mice. Interestingly, a
combination of anti-NKG2A and anti-PD-L1mAbs hada synergis-
tic effect, improving the control of tumor growth and rescuing
�75% of the mice from death (Figure 2B). The results obtained
for mice treated with anti-asialo-GM1 or anti-CD8a antibodies
also demonstrated that the anti-tumor effect of the anti-NKG2A/
PD-L1 mAbs combination therapy was dependent on both NK
and CD8+ T cells (Figure 2C). Thus, the combination of a blocking
anti-NKG2A mAb withablockinganti-PD-L1 mAb had atherapeu-
tic anti-tumor effect, because it unleashed NK cells and CD8+
T cells in the A20 model. Similar results were obtained with a com-
bination of anti-NKG2A/PD-1 mAbs (Figure S2).
Combined Blockade of NKG2A and PD-L1 Promotes the
Generation of Protective Anti-tumor Memory
We investigated the anti-tumor therapeutic properties of the anti-
NKG2A mAb further by using this antibody to treat C57BL/6 mice
bearing another tumor, i.e., the subcutaneously injected RMA-
Rae-1b T lymphoma. Like A20 cells, RMA-Rae-1b tumor cells ex-
press Qa-1b and PD-L1 (Figure S3). The frequency of NKG2A+ NK
cells in the tumor was higher than that in the spleen, but tumor-
infiltrating NK cells did not express PD-1, as observed in the
A20 model (Figure 3A). We found that �20% of total CD8+ TILs
expressed NKG2A, but not PD-1; �15% expressed both these
molecules; and �20% expressed PD-1, but not NKG2A (Fig-
ure 3A). Neither anti-NKG2A mAb nor anti-PD-L1 monotherapy
was effective in RMA-Rae-1b tumor-bearing mice (Figure 3B).
However, treatment with a combination of mAbs against
NKG2A and PD-L1 resulted in tumor growth control in 45% of
the tumor-bearing mice, which were rescued from death. The
combination therapy acted through the release of a CD8+ T cell,
but not an NK cell inhibition, as the injection of a depleting anti-
CD8a mAb, but not anti-NK1.1 mAbs, abolished tumor growth
control and impaired mouse survival (Figure 3C).
We observed the generation of CD62L� CD44+ effector mem-
ory CD8+ T cells in the spleens of mice in which RMA-Rae-1b
tumors were implanted and then cured by immunotherapy, but
not in the spleens of untreated mice (Figure 3D). Accordingly,
RMA-Rae-1b tumor cells were completely rejected when
injected into mice that had already been injected with the tumor
and cured by treatment with anti-NKG2A and anti-PD-L1 mAbs,
whereas the injection of these cells led to unchecked tumor
growth in untreated mice (Figure 3D). Therefore, in addition to
curing mice of their implanted tumors, blocking NKG2A in com-
bination with another ICI can promote durable protective anti-tu-
mor CD8+ T cell memory response in a preclinical mouse model.
HLA-E and NKG2A Expression in Human Tumors
We then monitored the expression of NKG2A and HLA-E at the
surface of several human tumors, to identify the indications for
which anti-NKG2A therapeutic blocking mAbs might promote
anti-tumor immunity in cancer patients. HLA-E was found to be
widely expressed on the surfaces of several human tumors.
We observed HLA-E expression in lung, pancreas, stomach,
colon, head and neck, and liver tumor tissues (Figure 4;
Table S1). By contrast, PD-L1 expression was restricted to a
fraction of lung, stomach, and colon tumors (Figure S4). HLA-E
was strongly expressed by squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck (SCCHN) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) (Fig-
ures 4A–4C), in which we also detected NKG2A-positive cells.
NKG2A-positive cells and HLA-E expression were also found
in ovarian, endometrial, CRC, and cervical cancer (Figure 4C).
NKp46+ NK and CD8+ TILs were also present in all these tumors.
We investigated SCCHN more closely by flow cytometry and de-
tected high frequencies of CD8+ TILs expressing PD-1 and co-
expressing both PD-1 and NKG2A in the tumor (Figure 4D).
NKG2A-expressing NK cells were also present at high fre-
quency, and some of these cells had a PD-1+ NKG2A+ pheno-
type. Similar results were obtained for CRC and lung tumors
(data not shown). Thus, several tumors expressed HLA-E and
were infiltrated with NK and CD8+ TILs expressing NKG2A.
Therefore, we reasoned that NKG2A blockade, either alone or
together with the use of other checkpoint inhibitors, such as
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, might improve the anti-tumor effi-
cacy of NK and CD8+ TILs in cancer patients.
Generation and Characterization of a Chimeric Blocking
mAb Directed against Human NKG2A
A murine anti-human NKG2A IgG1 mAb clone, Z270, was gener-
ated in a previous study (Sivori et al., 1996). We humanized this
antibody by fusion with an IgG4 with a single point mutation in
the Fc heavy chain to prevent the formation of half-antibodies
and screened the selected humanized clones for binding to
CD94-NKG2A with an affinity similar to that of the original murine
mAb. The selected humanized clone was named monalizumab
(IPH2201/NNC141-0100). Importantly, unlike other anti-NKG2A
(D) Upper left panels: FACS profiles of CD44 and CD62L expression on CD8+ T cells in the spleen of naive (no tumor) mice, mice receiving their first injection of
RMA Rae-1b tumor cells (RMA Rae-1b), and mice previously injected with RMA Rae-1b tumors, cured by immunotherapy and rechallenged (RMA Rae-1b + mAbs
rechallenged). Percentages of naive (CD44�CD62L+), central memory (TCM, CD44+CD62L+), effector memory (TEM, CD44+CD62L�) and effector CD8+ T cells

immunotherapy (n = 13) were rechallenged subcutaneously with RMA-Rae-1b tumor cells after 70 days. Untreated C57BL/6J mice (n = 15) also received in-
jections of RMA-Rae-1b cells as a control. The graphs show tumor growth in each individual mouse. The data presented are the pooled results of two independent
experiments.

 mAbs described to date, monalizumab is specific for human
NKG2A, as it bound human NKG2A+ cells, but not Ba/F3-trans-
fected cells expressing human NKG2C, the activating isoform of
NKG2A (Figure S5A). The EC50 calculated by whole blood titration
was 4.5 ng/mL for NKG2A+ NK cells and 11.4 ng/mL for NKG2A+
CD8+ T cells (Figure S5B). Finally, another critical feature of mon-
alizumab resides in its capacity to inhibit the binding of HLA-E
tetramers to human NK cells expressing NKG2A (Figure S5C).
Monalizumab Promotes the Anti-tumor Cell Activities of
Human NK Cells and CD8+ T Cells
We then sought to assess the blocking activity of monalizumab
on effector cells by monitoring the cell surface expression of
CD107 by NKG2A+ NK cells cocultured with K562 tumor target
cells expressing HLA-E (Figures 5A and 5B). The prototypic
K562 cells, which lack HLA-E, activated NK cells, but forced
HLA-E expression on K562 cells decreased the frequency of
CD107+ NKG2A+ NK cells. The addition of monalizumab to the
assay restored the production of CD107 by NKG2A+ NK cells
to the levels observed with parental K562 targets (Figure 5A).
In addition, monalizumab treatment led to increased frequencies
of CD107 expression and IFN-g production when IL-2-activated
NK cells were co-cultured with K562-HLA-E+ targets (Figure 5B).
We then assessed the anti-tumor efficacy of monalizumab in co-
cultures of NK cells with tumor cell lines with different levels of
HLA-E expression (Figure S6). Monalizumab increased the
frequency of activated NKG2A+ NK cells, as assessed by
measuring the cell-surface induction of CD107 and CD137
(4-1BB), an activation-induced costimulatory molecule, in co-
cultures with three different SCCHN cell lines and three different
ovarian tumor cell lines, although this stimulation was weaker for
the CAL-27 and Caov-2 cell lines (Figure S6).
The anti-NKG2A mAb and the anti-PD-L1 mAb had synergistic
effects in our preclinical mouse tumor models. We therefore as-
sessed the effects of a combination of monalizumab and durva-
lumab on NK cell activity against K562 cells co-expressing HLA-
E and PD-L1 in vitro. NKG2A+ PD-1+ NK cells were generated
by chronically stimulating various donor PBMCs with IL-15

agent, increased the frequencies of CD107+ NKG2A+ PD-1- NK
cells in cocultures with K562-HLA-E or K562-HLA-E-PD-L1 cells
(Figure 5D). Addition of durvalumab did not improve NK cell reac-
tivity in this assay. When used as a single agent, monalizumab
also improved CD107 expression by NKG2A+ PD-1+ NK cells
cocultured with K562-HLA-E targets. The use of monalizumab
or durvalumab as single agents only modestly increased
the reactivity of NKG2A+ PD-1+ NK cells cocultured with
K562-HLA-E-PD-L1 cells, whereas these two antibodies had
additive effects when used in combination. Thus, monalizumab
efficiently released the inhibition conferred by the engagement
of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A. In combination with other
ICI, monalizumab has additive effects, promoting NK-cell
effector functions.

CD8+ TILs expressed NKG2A (Figures 2A and 3A). We aimed to
generate antigen-specific NKG2A+ CD8+ T cells in vitro through
chronic stimulation with IL-15, monocytes and antigenic peptides
derived from human influenza virus (Flu) (Figure 5E). The Flu-spe-
cific CD8+ T cells obtained after nine days of culture harbored
different phenotypes. In addition to PD-1+ NKG2A� Flu-specific
CD8+ T cells, a substantial fraction of the Flu-specific CD8+
T cells co-expressed PD-1 and NKG2A (Figure 5E). Cells were
then cocultured with Flu peptide-pulsed K562-HLA-A2 cells ex-
pressing or not expressing the inhibitory ligands HLA-E and PD-
L1. The addition of monalizumab or durvalumab modestly
increased the frequency of CD107+NKG2A+ Flu-specific-CD8+
T cells (Figure 5F). However, the combination of monalizumab

 with durvalumab improved CD8+ T cell activity as assessed by
CD107 expression and IFN-g production, and by the killing of
target cells in a chromium release assay (Figures 5F and 5G).
Thus, monalizumab can promote activation and effector functions
of both NK cells and CD8+ T cells, and this effect is more marked
when it is used in combination with durvalumab.
Monalizumab Promotes Human NK Cell Antibody-
Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity
We then evaluated the potential of monalizumab to promote
NK-cell effector functions when combined with other commonly
used anti-tumor reagents, such as those promoting antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The anti-EGFR
mAb cetuximab is used to treat advanced and recurrent and/
or metastatic SCCHN and metastatic CRC. Cetuximab mobi-
lizes adaptive and innate immunity against tumor cells, partly
by promoting ADCC (Ferris et al., 2018). HLA-E membrane
expression in CRC could inhibit cetuximab-mediated cellular
cytotoxicity (Levy et al., 2009). We used a combination of
monalizumab and cetuximab to stimulate NK cells against an
SCCHN cell line in vitro (Figure 6A, left panel), and monitored
the induction of CD137 as a marker of NK cell activation
including ADCC. This combination of mAbs amplified the acti-
vation of NK cells, as shown by the higher frequencies of
CD137+ NK cells. Monalizumab also enhanced the NK cell-
mediated ADCC by the anti-CD20 mAb obinutuzumab in
cocultures with B cell lines expressing MHC class I (Figure 6A,
right panel). Thus, the anti-NKG2A mAb monalizumab can
amplify the beneficial effects of other IO treatments, such as
those promoting ADCC.
Tumor Control by a Combination of Monalizumab and
Cetuximab in Patients with SCCHN
We found that combinations of NKG2A-blocking mAbs with
other IO treatments, such as anti-PD-1 mAbs, anti-PD-L1
mAbs or cetuximab, had additive effects on anti-tumor immunity
in preclinical experimental settings in vitro and in vivo. These re-
sults provide a scientific rationale for evaluations of the efficacy
and safety of monalizumab in cancer patients. SCCHN tumors
were strongly positive for HLA-E and were infiltrated with CD8+
T cells and NK cells, which may express NKG2A (Figures 4A,
4B, and 4D). Cetuximab is used in the standard care regimen
for SCCHN (Vermorken et al., 2007). We therefore assessed
the safety and efficacy of the combination of monalizumab and
cetuximab in patients with previously treated recurrent or meta-
static (R/M) SCCHN in a phase II clinical trial (NCT02643550). We
evaluated five doses of monalizumab (0.4, 1, 2, 4, 10 mg/kg
every 2 weeks) in combination with the approved dose of cetux-
imab (400 mg/m2 loading dose and then 250 mg/m2 weekly). The
maximum tolerated dose was not reached and the highest dose
of monalizumab tested (10 mg/kg) was used for expansion of the
phase II cohort. We used a one-stage Fleming design with futility
analysis after the first 11 patients; the overall phase II study will
include 40 patients. The characteristics of the patients are shown
in Table 1. As of March 9, 2018, 31 patients with R/M SCCHN
were treated and evaluable for safety, of which 26 patients
were evaluable for efficacy while the remaining patients were
studied too early for assessment. All 31 patients had been

 previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, and 24
patients received one or two systemic treatment regimens. Four-
teen patients had already received immunotherapies, and three
had been already treated with cetuximab for locally advanced
disease and had been free from progressive disease for at least
4 months. Safety was the primary endpoint of part I and objective
response rate (ORR) of part II. The combination was well toler-
ated. Most of the adverse events (AE) observed (93%) were of
grades 1–2 severity, rapidly reversible and easily manageable.
The most common monalizumab-related AEs were fatigue
(17%), pyrexia (13%), and headache (10%). Other monalizu-
mab-related AEs (interstitial lung disease, colitis and hypophos-
phatemia) were reported in 1 patient each. The most frequent
AEs reported for cetuximab in previous studies (Vermorken
et al., 2007) were skin disorders (rash, 49%; acne, 26%; nail dis-
orders, 16%; dry skin, 14%), and these effects were not exacer-
bated by monalizumab. No infusion-related reactions were
observed (patients received premedication for cetuximab as
specified on the label). No treatment-related death was reported.
No new or unusual signs suggestive of poor safety were
observed with the combination of monalizumab and cetuximab.
We thus concluded that the safety profile of the combination was
similar to that for the two single agents.
Interim treatment efficacy results for the phase II trial showed
that treatment with the monalizumab and cetuximab combina-
tion resulted in a confirmed RECIST partial response in 8 of 26
patients (31%), stable disease (SD) in 14 of 26 (54%) and pro-
gressive disease (PD) in 3 of 26 (11%) patients and one patient
died from progressive disease at week 8 without post-baseline
imaging (Figures 6B–6D). The lesion disappeared in one patient,
as shown in Figure 6D. Assuming an ORR of 25%, using 10% as
the cutoff for inactivity, a = 0.05, and a power of 0.76, the prede-
fined number of eight responses required to declare a positive
result for the trial already was reached. Two of the eight
patients with confirmed responses had previously received
immunotherapy. At the time of the analysis, the median response
duration was not reached; six responding patients were still on
treatment. Median follow-up time was 129 days: 17 patients
(55%) were still on treatment, 14 patients (45%) had stopped
treatment, because of progressive disease in 12 (38%), and
adverse event in one and on the decision of the investigator in
the final case. The activity of single agent cetuximab in recurrent
and/or metastatic SCCHN is limited with a 13% ORR, a median
duration of response (DoR) of 4 months, a median progression-
free survival (PFS) of 2.3 months, and a median overall survival
(OS) of 5.6 months (Vermorken et al., 2007, 2008). Even if no
formal comparison can be made, the activity of monalizumab
combined to cetuximab appears higher than historical data for
cetuximab alone, although cross-trial comparisons of this kind
should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of
patients involved and possible differences in patient population
and trial methodology. Overall, these data showed that the com-
bination therapy of monalizumab with cetuximab has promise for
the treatment of patients with SCCHN with expected toxicity
profile of either agent alone.
DISCUSSION
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have greatly improved the control
of several types of cancer, but the efficacy of these treatments
needs to be further improved, as does the ability to control their
toxicity. One way of achieving this goal would be to identify
critical immune checkpoints other than PD-1 and CTLA-4 for
targeting by therapeutic antibodies to promote effective immune
responses to cancers. Most immunomodulatory strategies to
date have focused on enhancing T cell responses, but there
has been a recent surge of interest in harnessing the relatively
underexplored NK cell compartment for therapeutic interven-
tions (Cerwenka and Lanier, 2018; Guillerey and Smyth, 2016;
Rautela et al., 2018; Vivier et al., 2012; Chiossone et al., 2018).
The manipulation of NK cells in cancer is designed to initiate a
multilayered immune response culminating in protective and
long-lasting immunity to tumors based on a number of different
cell types, including T cells.
Here, we focus on the NKG2A receptor, a well-known ITIM-
bearing inhibitory receptor expressed on both T and NK cells
(Lo
´ pez-Botet et al., 2000; Moretta et al., 2001), emitting inhib-
itory signals transduced via the protein tyrosine phosphatase
SHP-1 (Viant et al., 2014). The abundance of NKG2A+CD8+
T cells is low in human blood, but NKG2A expression can be
induced at the surface of CD8+ T cells upon activation (Braud
et al., 2003). The targeting of NKG2A with a blocking antibody
would therefore have the unique advantage of enhancing

 T and NK cell responses. Another advantage of targeting
NKG2A is the safety of this approach, as no abnormalities
have been reported in mouse strains lacking CD94 (Vance
et al., 1999; Orr et al., 2010), which forms a heterodimer
with NKG2A. These mice therefore lack cell-surface NKG2A
expression.
One critical point for such an approach is the expression of
NKG2A and HLA-E during cancer. We have shown that the
NKG2A receptor is expressed on NK and T cells in the tumor
bed in many human cancers and we have also shown that its
ligand, HLA-E, is frequently overexpressed in tumors. By
contrast, classical MHC-I expression is often weak on tumor
cells, and this downregulation has been recognized as a major
mechanism by which tumor cells escape T cell control (Garrido
et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2017). Unlike classical HLA class I
molecules, HLA-E continues to be expressed on the surface of
tumor cells, often even more strongly than on healthy cells, in pa-
tients with solid tumors or leukemia/lymphoma (Benson et al.,
2012; Mamessier et al., 2011; Platonova et al., 2011; Talebian
Yazdi et al., 2016). This conservation of expression likely results
from the dependence of cell-surface HLA-E expression on many
distinct peptides, including the leader peptides of HLA-A, -B, or
-C. Downregulation of HLA-E expression therefore would require
at least the elimination of three types of HLA molecules. Our data
for NKG2A expression are consistent with earlier reports on
tumor-infiltrating NK and T cells in melanoma and breast and
cervical cancers (Mamessier et al., 2011; Sheu et al., 2005). A
complementary study showed in several tumor mouse models
that expression of NKG2A is associated with worse clinical
outcome (van Montfoort et al., 2018).
One of the key findings of our studies is the demonstration that
NKG2A is often co-expressed with PD-1 on CD8+ T cells. PD-1
expression is a hallmark of exhausted CD8+ T cells (Hashimoto
et al., 2018). This result therefore suggested that NKG2A expres-
sion might constitute an additional brake to release for reversing
CD8+ T cell exhaustion. The regulation of NKG2A expression on
both NK and CD8+ T cells remains to be dissected in detail.
Nevertheless, unlike PD-1 expression, which can be observed
on the surface of CD8+ T cells from whole blood or lymph nodes
from cancer patients, the number of NKG2A-expressing CD8+
T cells was selectively increased at the tumor bed or adjacent tis-
sue. These results suggest that signals derived specifically from
the tumor would be required to induce, or to sustain NKG2A
expression.
We also found that HLA-E was more frequently expressed
than PD-L1 in several types of cancer. This finding is consistent
with previous suggestions that HLA-E expression may account
for some of the lack of responsiveness to anti-PD-x observed
in Merkel cell carcinoma (Paulson et al., 2018) and in an in vivo
CRISPR screening program that identified Qa-1b (the mouse
HLA-E ortholog) as a cancer immunotherapy target, because
Qa-1b loss-of-function increased the efficacy of immunotherapy
by PD-1 blockade (Manguso et al., 2017). These data support
the use of a combination of mAbs blocking the PD-x and
NKG2A/HLA-E inhibitory pathways. Our results in mice indicate
that NKG2A pathway blockade does indeed improve tumor
control when combined with a blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1
inhibitory pathway. We also demonstrated the generation of pro-
tective memory CD8+ T cells in mice into which RMA-Rae-1b
tumors were implanted and then cured by combined PD-L1
and NKG2A blockade. Thus, our preclinical results provide a
rationale for combining monalizumab and durvalumab into
a novel immunotherapy for cancer patients. Importantly, such
a clinical trial is ongoing (NCT02671435) and very recently pre-
liminary safety and efficacy data were reported (Segal et al.,
2018). Briefly, the dose escalation part of the study demon-
strated the feasibility of combining the two agents with no new
safety signals noted beyond the known safety profile for each in-
dividual agent. The initial clinical activity data from a cohort
expansion in pretreated (median of three previous lines of sys-
temic therapy) microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS
CRC; n = 39) demonstrated an ORR of 8% (median duration of
response of 16.1 weeks) and a disease control rate (DCR) at
16 weeks of 31% (Segal et al., 2018). Although these results
are very preliminary, they are an example of potential therapeutic
opportunities for immunotherapy in MSS CRC, a setting in which
immune checkpoint-based therapy has, so far, failed to demon-
strate any consistent and meaningful clinical benefit.
Combining a blockade of inhibitory signals with the delivery of
activating signals should improve the efficacy of immunother-
apies. Many possible approaches of this type are being tested,
including the triggering of innate immunity via the delivery of
TLR ligands (Du et al., 2016), activation of the STING pathway
at the tumor bed (Corrales et al., 2016), treatment with antibodies
targeting activating cell surface receptors (Callahan et al., 2016;
Muntasell et al., 2017), and the use of engineered forms of cyto-
kines, such pegylated IL-2 (Charych et al., 2017; Charych et al.,
2016) and IL-2 variants (Sockolosky et al., 2018). Antibodies
directed against tumor cells also could be used to stimulate
the immune response to tumor cells, thereby helping to eliminate
cancer. The mode of action of these treatments differs between
antibodies, but efficacy is partly dependent on ADCC, as for rit-
uximab, an anti–CD20 mAb used to treat non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Cartron and Watier,
2017). Other antibodies are also used to stimulate the immune
system via ADCC. One such antibody is cetuximab, which is
used in metastatic CRC and SCCHN. We showed in vitro
that NKG2A blockade with monalizumab boosts NK cell-medi-
ated ADCC against cetuximab-coated SCCHN tumor cells.
Consistent with these data, treatment with a combination of
monalizumab and cetuximab was found to be effective in the
NCT02643550 phase II clinical trial for SCCHN. Importantly, lit-
tle, if any, toxicity was associated with blocking NKG2A and
especially no signs of auto-immunity. The encouraging results
obtained for SCCHN in NCT02643550 and for MSS CRC in
NCT02671435 require consolidation in further clinical trials, but
they constitute a key step toward the use of monalizumab in
combination treatments against cancer. Once the samples
from all the patients enrolled in the monalizumab clinical trials
will be accessible, translational studies will be performed. In
particular, it will be addressed whether the expression of
HLA-E at the tumor bed is linked to the HLA types of the patients
(Horowitz et al., 2016; Ramsuran et al., 2018) and to the clinical
outcome.
In conclusion, we report here the full characterization of a
first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor, monalizumab. This
1740
Cell 175, 1731–1743, December 13, 2018
 therapeutic antibody has several key features. First, it enhances
the antitumor activities of both T and NK cells, by blocking
the inhibitory function of NKG2A. Second, the ligand of NKG2A
is the non-classical MHC class I molecule HLA-E, which is
frequently overexpressed on human tumors, providing a mecha-
nism of resistance to lymphocyte activation at the tumor bed.
Third, monalizumab is well tolerated in humans and has yielded
encouraging efficacy results in clinical trials assessing its use in
combination with cetuximab in SCCHN, and in combination with
durvalumab in MSS CRC, two clinical conditions with low ORRs,
for which therapeutic options are very limited. Therefore, anti-
NKG2A mAb is a promising checkpoint inhibitor that promotes
antitumor immunity by enhancing the activities of both T and
NK cells. Interestingly, NKG2A has been shown to contribute
to the inhibition HIV-infected target cell clearance by NK cells
(Ramsuran et al., 2018). Thus, beyond cancer, the therapeutic
blockade of NKG2A/HLA-E interaction by monalizumab may
be beneficial in patients with HIV disease, and in other conditions
that remain to be explored.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice were reared at Janvier Laboratories under specific pathogen-free conditions. Female mice were used at
eight to 12 weeks of age and were allowed to acclimate to the housing facility for at least one week. All animal experiments were
performed in accordance with the rules of the Innate Pharma ethics and animal welfare committees.
Cell lines
For A20 Qa-1b KO cell line, gene editing was used to introduce a targeted deletion in the H2-T23 gene in the A20 mouse cell line. To
control the targeted deletion of Qa-1b by flow cytometry, the A20 cell line were grown with 125 UI/mL mouse IFN-g during 24 hr to
induce the Qa-1b cell surface expression. The pool of A20 edited cells were stained with the anti-mouse-Qa-1b antibody and the
negative cells were sorted.
K562-HLA-E cell line was transduced with HLA-A2 lentivirus. Positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry and expanded in culture.
The human PD-L1 gene (AAI13735.1) was cloned into an expression vector. The K562-HLA-E and the K562 HLA-E/HLA-A2 cell lines
were transfected by nucleofection using the 4D-NucleofectorTM system from Lonza (Program FF-120, SF solution). The day after
transfection, the hygromycin selection was added to the nucleofected cells at 400mg/ml.
Human primary cells
Peripheral blood samples from healthy donors were obtained from Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS, Marseille) under a written
consent obtained from each volunteer.
Peripheral blood, metastatic and non-metastatic lymph node, tumors and juxta tumor tissues from SCCHN patients were obtained
at the time of surgical resection under Institut Curie approved protocol and written informed consent from each patient. Patients’
characteristics are summarized in Table S1.
Human trial information
Patients had to meet all of the following criteria for inclusion in the study: (i) age R 18 years; (ii) histologically or cytologically-
confirmed, HPV (+) or HPV (-) squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx (WHO type 1), oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx (supra-
glottis, glottis, subglottis) or oral cavity; (iii) recurrent or metastatic disease, documented by imaging (CT scan, MRI, X-ray) and/or
physical examination; (iv) no prior treatment by cetuximab except if given for primary treatment (locally advanced disease) with no
progressive disease for at least 4 months following the end of prior cetuximab treatment.
METHOD DETAILS
Monoclonal anti-mouse NKG2A antibody
The mouse version of 20D5 antibody was generated by a classical CDR grafting method. The variable domain sequences of the
heavy and light chains of the original rat antibody were first aligned with the mouse genome sequence. The CDR1, CDR2 and
CDR3 regions of the variable heavy chain and of the variable light chain domains of the rat antibody were then inserted into the closest

 matching mouse sequences identified. The variable domain of the mousified light chain was inserted in frame with a mouse Ck
domain into a eukaryotic expression vector to generate the light chain. The variable domain of the mousified heavy chain was inserted
in frame with the constant domains of a mouse IgG1 harboring the N297Q mutation. CHO cells were then transfected with both the
heavy- and light-chain constructs, to produce the antibody, which was then purified from the supernatant with Protein-A Sephar-
ose beads.
In vivo murine tumor experiments
For A20 tumor experiments, 5x106 cells in endotoxin-free PBS were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flank of BALB/c recipient
mice. For RMA-Rae-1b experiments, 5x105 cells were injected s.c. into the flank of C57BL/6J recipient mice. Tumor size was
monitored with a digital caliper (Mitutoyo) every three to four days and is expressed as a volume ((length x width2) /2). Mice were
sacrificed when the tumor reached a size of 2000 mm3. For the purposes of Kaplan-Meier curves, mice were considered dead
when tumor volume exceeded 1800 mm3.
For NK cell depletion, 100 mL of polyclonal anti-asialo-GM1 (Poly21460, Biolegend) antibody were injected i.p. into BALB/c mice
once weekly. Normal rabbit serum was administrated as control. For C57BL/6J mice, 100 mg of anti-NK1.1 (PK136 clone) antibody
were injected i.v. every 10 days. An isotype control was used as a control.
For the depletion of CD8+T cells in BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice, 400 mg of depleting anti-CD8a (YTS 169.4) mAb were administered
i.v. for the initial injection and then 200 mg once weekly for two subsequent injections. A rat IgG2b, k (Bio X cell) was used as control.
Immune cell depletions were initiated as indicated in the figure legends.
Treatments with checkpoint blockade antibodies were initiated when tumor volume was between 50 and 100 mm3. Anti-PD-L1
mAb (mouse IgG1) was administered by i.p. injection, at a dose of 50 mg for A20 tumors and 200 mg for RMA-Rae-1b tumors, twice
weekly for three weeks. Mice received 200 mg of anti-NKG2A mAb by i.v. injection three times, at three- to four-day intervals. Anti-
PD-1 mAb (rat IgG2a, RMP1-14 clone) was administered by three i.p. injections of 200 mg every 3-4 days.
Mice were killed for tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) analysis 19 days after tumor cell injection for A20 and 12 days after tumor cell
injection for RMA Rae-1b.
Flow cytometry analysis of splenic and tumor-infiltrating mouse lymphocytes (TILs)
Tumors were dissected into small pieces and digested with enzymes A and D from the Mouse Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec)
and program 37C_m_TDK_1 of the GentleMACS Octo Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec). Digested tumors were then filtered
through a 70 mm-pore size MACS SmartStrainer (Miltenyi Biotec) and washed with RPMI 1640 medium. For A20 tumors, this step was
followed by purification with mouse CD19 Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Spleens were mechanically dissociated with GentleMACS dissociator, in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% FBS. Disso-
ciated spleens were passed through 70 mm-pore size pre-separation filters (Miltenyi Biotec) and washed with RPMI 1640 medium.
Red blood cells were lysed after 5 min of incubation on ice with ammonium chloride solution (Stemcell) and then washed with RPMI
1640 medium.
We then incubated 1x106 or fewer cells per A20 tumor and 2-10 3 106 cells per RMA Rae-1b tumor or 10 3 106 splenocytes with
5 mg/mL blocking anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody (clone 2.4G2, BD PharMingen) at 4�C for 5 min before surface staining with an
antibody cocktail at 4�C for 30 min in 100 mL. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain
Kit (Molecular Probes) at 4�C for 15 min, and washed twice with staining buffer (0.2% BSA 2 mM EDTA 0.02% NaN3 in PBS). Finally,
cells were fixed by incubation in BD Cytofix Fixation Buffer (BD Biosciences) at 4�C for 30 min. Samples were then analyzed with a BD
LSR Fortessa X-20 cell analyzer and BD FACSDiva Software version 8.0.
Functional assays with BALB/c splenocytes and A20 TILs
Splenocytes from BALB/c mice stimulated i.p. with 50 mg of poly I:C and A20 TILs were prepared as previously described. They were
incubated with YAC-1 (Qa-1b-) or IFN-g-simulated A20 (Qa-1b+) tumor cells, with an effector/target ratio of 10:1 (for splenic effector
cells) or 1:1 (for A20 TILs), for 4 hr at 37�C, under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2, in the presence of monensin (Golgi Stop) and
5 mg/mL anti-NKG2A mAb or 5 mg/mL anti-PD-L1 mAb, or both. The frequencies of CD107a-producing NKG2A+ NK and NKG2A+PD-
1+ CD8+ T cells were assessed by flow cytometry.
Immunohistochemistry
OCT-embedded frozen human tissue blocks were cut into 5 to 7 mm-thick sections on Superfrost Plus glass slides. After tissue
rehydration with PBS, endogenous peroxidases were blocked by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 15-30 min at room
temperature. Tissue sections were blocked with 5% goat serum and stained for 1 h at room temperature with the following
unconjugated primary Abs: anti-NKG2A (clone Z270, Innate Pharma), anti-HLA-E (clone 3D12, Biolegend), anti-NKp46 (clone 9E2,
Becton Dickinson) or anti-CD8 (clone C8/144B, Dako). Anti-NKG2A, anti-HLA-E and anti-NKp46 Abs were used at a concentration
of 5 mg/mL and anti-CD8 mAb was used at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Matching control mAb (mouse IgG1 isotype control; clone
DAK-GO1, Dako) staining was performed in parallel. The signal was then amplified with the EnVision/HRP kit (K4001, Dako) for 30 min
at room temperature. Enzymatic activity was detected with 3,30-diaminobenzidine (SK-4100, Vector Laboratories) substrate. Tissue
sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin II followed by bluing reagent (Roche, Ventana). Finally, tissues were washed with

 tap water, dehydrated in ethanol and cleared in xylene. Slides were mounted in Pertex and scanned on a Nanozoomer 2.0-HT slide
scanner (Hamamatsu). Positive and negative controls (frozen cell pellets) were included in each run.
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) commercial human tissue microarrays (USBiomax) were stained on a Benchmark
automaton (Ventana). After pretreatment with Cell Conditioning 1 (Ventana), sections were incubated for 1 hr at 37�C with anti-
HLA-E (clone MEM-E/02, Exbio) or anti-PD-L1 (clone E1L3N, Cell Signaling Technology) mAbs at concentrations of 1 mg/mL and
10 mg/mL, respectively. An anti-mouse/rabbit IgG detection system (UltraView Universal DAB Detection Kit, Ventana) was used
for amplification and primary Ab detection. Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin, washed, dehydrated, cleared, mounted
and coverslipped. Slides were scanned on a Nanozoomer 2.0-HT slide scanner (Hamamatsu). Positive and negative controls (FFPE
cell pellets) were included in each run. When needed, and only for representation purpose, a color deconvolution algorithm was
applied to bright-field images using ImageJ color deconvolution plugin (Ruifrok AC, Johnston DA. Quantification of histochemical
staining by color deconvolution. Anal Quant Cytol Histol 23: 291-299, 2001) and resulting components images were inverted. Finally,
pseudocolors were attributed to hematoxylin counterstain and HLA-E or NKG2A markers.
Five different cohorts (frozen tissues): colorectal (n = 48), ovarian (n = 40), endometrial (n = 41) and cervical cancers (n = 17) and one
cohort of head and neck (n = 65) (FFPE tissues) were used. Staining was interpreted and scored by a trained pathologist. The
following scoring method was used: score 0 = no positive cells; score 1 = between 1 and 33% of positive cells; score 2 = between
34 and 66% of positive cells and score 3 R 67% of positive cells. HLA-E expression was assessed separately on tumor cells and
lymphocytes and CD8+, NKp46+ and NKG2A+ cells quantified separately in the tumor nest and the stroma. For FFPE tissues, tissue
microarrays of lung (n = 45), pancreas (n = 79), stomach (n = 76), colon (n = 109), head and neck (n = 70) and liver tumors (n = 106) were
stained. The cytonuclear and area quantification modules (Halo, Indica Labs) were used to quantify NKp46+ cell density (number of
positive cells/mm2) and the area stained for PD-L1 (area of positive tissue/total area of the tissue of interest, expressed as a
percentage).
Monocyte-CD8 T cell cocultures
Human PBMCs were thawed or freshly isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. Monocytes were purified by positive
selection with the CD14 microbeads kit. The CD14-negative fraction was retained for the isolation of CD8+ T cells with a CD8+ T cell
negative selection kit. Monocytes and CD8+ T cells were cocultured, in a 1:1 ratio, in IMDM supplemented with 1% penicillin-strep-
tomycin and 10% human AB serum, in 24-well plates. rhIL-15 (10 ng/mL) and flu peptide (5 mg/mL) were added to cultures. Cells were
cultured for 9 days at 37�C with replenishment with rhIL-15-supplemented medium every three days.
Long-term culture of PBMCs with IL-15 for the generation of PD-1+ NK cells
Human PBMCs were isolated from buffy coats by gradient density centrifugation in Pancoll Lymphocyte Separating Medium. PBMCs
were used to seed 24-well culture plates at a density of 2x106 cell/mL per well, in complete culture medium (IMDM + 1% penicillin-
streptomycin and 10% human AB serum), at a final volume of 1 mL per well containing IL-15 at a final concentration of 10 ng/mL. Cells
were cultured for 9 days at 37�C with replenishment with rhIL-15-supplemented medium every three days.
Flu-specific CD8+ T cell staining
The percentage of flu-specific CD8+ T cells was determined by staining on day 0 before coculture and on day 9 of monocyte-CD8+
T cell coculture. Cells were transferred to a 5 mL tube, centrifuged and incubated with MHC multimer conjugated with APC for 10 min,
in the dark, at room temperature. A mixture of antibodies was then added and incubated with the cells for 30 min at 4�C in the dark.
The antibodies used were: anti-CD3-PerCP, anti-CD8-APC, anti-PD-1 BV421, and anti-NKG2A-PE antibodies. Dead cells were
excluded with Live/Dead Fixable Aqua stain. After incubation, the cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Functional assay with CD8+ T cells (expression of CD107/IFN-g)
CD8+ T cells were recovered from co-cultures with monocytes after 9 days in the presence of rhIL-15 and flu peptide. Cells were
transferred to 96-well plates and incubated with target cell lines (K562 transfected to express HLA-A2, HLA-E and PD-L1). Target
cells were first pulsed with 1 mg/mL flu peptide for 1 h at 37�C and washed three times before incubation with CD8+ T cells and
antibodies, such as monalizumab (20 mg/mL), durvalumab (20 mg/mL) and anti-human CD64 antibody (10 mg/mL). Golgi Stop was
added. Plates were centrifuged and incubated for 4 hr at 37�C. The plates were then washed before re-staining with monalizumab
at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Cells were washed twice, incubated with anti-human IgG4 (Fc)-PE, washed twice and then stained
with a mixture of antibodies (anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD8-APC-Cy7, anti-PD1-BV421, anti-CD107a-APC, anti-CD107b-APC) and
Live/Dead Fixable Aqua stain. Cells were washed twice and incubated overnight with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm. The next day, cells
were washed twice and the intracellular staining was performed for 30 min at 4�C with anti-IFN-g-PercPCy5.5 antibody. Plates
were read on a flow cytometer to analyze the percentages of CD107+ and IFN-g-producing CD8+ T cells.
Preparation of human TILs
Tissues were mechanically dissociated before enzymatic digestion using collagenase I (2 mg/mL, Sigma C0130), DNase I (25mg/mL,
Roche 10104159001) and hyaluronidase (2mg/mL, SIGMA H3506). Red cells from dissociated tissues and whole blood were
lysed (eBioscience 00-4300-54) and dead cells stained with Live/Dead Aqua. Cells were stained with the antibodies detailed in
e5

 the Key Resources Table. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD LSR FORTESSA) using the BD FACS DIVA software 8.0.
Data were analyzed on FlowJo V10.02.
Functional assay with CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic assay)
Flu-specific CD8+ T cell lytic activity was assessed against K562 HLA-E HLA-A2 PD-L1 cells using a standard chromium release
assay. K562 cells co-expressing HLA-E HLA-A2 and PD-L1 were first pulsed with 1 mg/mL flu peptide for 1 h at 37�C and then washed
three times before loading with 51Cr for 1 h. After washing, cells were plated with CD8+ T cells at 2:1 effector-to-target (E:T) cell ratio in
presence of anti-human CD64 antibody (10 mg/mL) and in presence or absence of monalizumab (20 mg/mL), durvalumab (20 mg/mL)
or isotype control antibodies. After 4 h at 37�C, 50 mL of supernatant was harvested and counted in a Topcount microplate scintillation
gamma counter. Data were acquired in counts per minute. Specific lysis was calculated according to the formula [(test release �
spontaneous release)/(maximum release � spontaneous release)] 3 100. Spontaneous release represents 51Cr release from target
cells in medium alone, and maximum release is the 51Cr release from target cells lysed in medium 2% Triton X-100, each measured in
at least six replicate wells.
Phenotypic analysis of NK cells in day 9 cultures
The phenotype of NK cells in rhIL-15-supplemented cultures of PBMCs was analyzed on days 0 and 9 with the following panel of
antibodies:
anti-CD3-PercPCy5.5,
anti-CD56-PE-Vio770,
anti-CD8-APC-Cy7,
anti-PD1-BV421,
anti-NKG2A-APC
and
the
Live/Dead Fixable Aqua stain kit.
Functional assays with peripheral human NK cells
The effector cells used were total PBMCs, purified human NK cells, nine-day culture of PBMCs with rhIL-15 or seven-day culture with
rhIL-2 (PROLEUKIN) of enriched peripheral blood NK cells by CD3 depletion followed by CD56 positive selection. NK cells were incu-
bated at a ratio of 1:1 or 5:2 with target cell lines (SCCHN, ovarian cancer cell lines or K562 cells transfected to express HLA-E and/or
PDL-1). Cells were dispensed into 96-well plates with or without single antibodies or combinations of antibodies: monalizumab
(10 mg/mL), durvalumab (10 mg/mL), cetuximab (0.1 mg/mL), obinutuzumab (1 mg/mL). Anti-human CD64 antibody (10 mg/mL) was
added to saturate FcR. Plates were centrifuged and incubated for 4 hr (CD107) or 24 hr (CD137) at 37�C. The cells were incubated
with monalizumab (1 mg/mL) for 30 min at 4�C followed with anti-human IgG4 (Fc)-PE to detect total surface NKG2A. Cells were then
incubated with a mixture of antibodies (anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD56-PE- Vio770 and anti-PD1-BV421 antibodies or anti-CD3-AmCyan
and anti-CD56-V450) together with either anti-CD107a and anti-CD107b antibodies or anti-CD137 antibody and Live/Dead Fixable
stain. For IFN-g detection, cells were fixed and intracellular stained with anti-IFN-g-APC antibody. Cells were washed twice and
resuspended in BD CellFix for analysis on a FACSCanto II or a LSRII UV flow cytometer.
Inhibition of HLA-E tetramers binding
Solution of biotinylated-HLA-E monomers (5nM solution, kindly provided by Novo Nordisk) was slowly mixed with PE-conjugated
streptavidin (Southern Biotechnology) at a ratio 1/4 and then kept at 4�C until use. Competition of monalizumab and PE-conjugated
tetramers was performed on peripheral blood from healthy donors (EFS). 100mL of whole blood was incubated for 1 h at 37�C with
50mL PBS containing PE-HLA-E tetramers (0.1mL) and monalizumab (ranging from 30mg/mL to 0,001mg/mL, 1/3 dilution) and then
washed with PBS. Peripheral blood cells were then stained with anti-CD3-PercpCy5.5 (BD Biosciences), anti-CD45-APC (BD
Biosciences), anti-CD3-PC7 (BD Biosciences) and anti-human IgG4 Fc-FITC (HP6025, Southern Biotechnology). Red blood cells
were lyzed with Optilyse C solution (Beckman Coulter). Acquisition was performed on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer.
Trial design
Phase II study of monalizumab, a first-in-class NKG2A monoclonal antibody, in combination with cetuximab in previously treated
recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (NCT02643550) is a multicenter, international (US and
France), open label, single arm study to evaluate the antitumor activity of monalizumab in combination with cetuximab. Five dose
levels of monalizumab (0.4, 1, 2, 4, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) in combination with the approved dosage of cetuximab (400 mg/m2
load then 250 mg/m2 weekly) were explored. The highest dose tested (10 mg/kg) was used for the phase II cohort expansion; the
overall phase II study will include 40 patients. The trial consisted of 2 parts: a phase Ib dose escalation part of monalizumab combined
with cetuximab followed by a cohort expansion phase II part of cetuximab + monalizumab. The decision to conduct the phase II part
was made by the sponsor after Safety Committee review and was based on all the available data from phase I part (safety, efficacy,
PK and PD) and from the monalizumab overall program.
Phase Ib - Dose escalation part
This part was open to pre-treated patients (regardless of the number of previous treatment lines) with recurrent and/or metastatic
SCCHN. A 3+3 design was used and 5 escalating dose levels of monalizumab were explored with fixed doses of cetuximab. If
the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was not reached, monalizumab would be tested in the phase II part at a dose of 10 mg/kg.
Primary endpoint: DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) of monalizumab combined with cetuximab was assessed using National Cancer
Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03
Cell 175, 1731–1743.e1–e7, December 13, 2018
e6
 Phase II - Cohort expansion
The cohort was expanded with cetuximab and monalizumab given at the dose recommended in phase Ib. This part was restricted to
patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN who had received up to 2 prior systemic regimens for incurable SCCHN. A Gehan-
like stopping rule for futility was used after 11 evaluable patients. A maximum of 40 patients were included. Primary endpoint: Objec-
tive Response Rate (ORR) was estimated according to RECIST 1.1.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Details on statistics used can be found in figure legends. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software
version 7 (GraphPad). Kaplan Meier was used for survival representations. When sample size was large enough, normality of pop-
ulations was tested using d’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test. When normality was not reached, statistical significance be-
tween two paired samples populations was determined using Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank test, statistical analyses for three
or more groups. N represents the number of samples used in the experiments. Samples are shown with means or medians with or
without error bars showing the SD.
Significance was assumed with *p < 0.05; **p % 0.01; ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.

cells < 3.5%) were incubated with various concentrations of monalizumab (ranging from 0 to 10 mg/mL), washed and then incubated with PE-conjugated HLA-E
tetramers. NK cells were defined as CD56+ CD3- lymphocytes. The percentage inhibition was calculated as follows: inhibition (%) = 100 – 100*[(MFI PE (at
X mg/mL of monalizumab) – MFI PE FMO)/(MFI PE (at 0 mg/mL of monalizumab) - MFI FMO)]. MFI: mean fluorescence intensity; FMO: fluorescence minus one.

(A) FACS profiles showing HLA-E expression at the cell surface in SCCHN cell lines. White histograms: isotype control; gray histograms: anti-HLA-E mAb. NK
cells were co-cultured with the cell line indicated, in the presence or absence of monalizumab. The frequencies of CD107- and CD137-producing NKG2A+ NK
cells are shown. Each donor is represented by a single dot. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
(B) FACS profiles showing HLA-E expression at the cell surface in ovarian cancer cell lines. White histograms: isotype control; gray histograms: anti-HLA-E mAb.
NK cells were co-cultured with the cell line indicated (after overnight stimulation of the cell line with IFN-g) in the presence or absence of monalizumab. The
frequencies of CD107- and CD137-producing NKG2A+ NK cells are shown. Each donor is represented by a single dot. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test,
* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
