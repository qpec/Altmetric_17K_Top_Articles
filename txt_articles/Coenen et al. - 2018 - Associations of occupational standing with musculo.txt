ABSTRACT 
Objective: Given the high exposure to occupational standing in specific occupations, and 
recent initiatives to encourage intermittent standing among white-collar workers, a better 
understanding of the potential health consequences of occupational standing is required. 
We aimed to review and quantify the epidemiological evidence on associations of 
occupational standing with musculoskeletal symptoms.  
Design: A systematic review was performed. Data from included articles were extracted and 
described, and meta-analyses conducted when data were sufficiently homogenous. 
Data sources: Electronic databases were systematically searched (up to February 2015) 
Eligibility criteria: Peer-reviewed articles on occupational standing and musculoskeletal 
symptoms from epidemiological studies were identified.  
Results: Of the 11,750 articles screened, 50 articles reporting 49 studies were included (45 
cross-sectional and 5 longitudinal; n=88,158 participants) describing the associations of 
occupational standing with musculoskeletal symptoms, including low-back (39 articles), 
lower extremity (14 articles) and upper extremity (18 articles) symptoms. In the meta-
analysis, ‘excessive’ (>4 hours/workday) occupational standing was associated with the 
occurrence of low-back symptoms (pooled odds ratio [95% CI] 1.31[1.10 1.56]). Evidence on 
lower and upper extremity symptoms was too heterogeneous for meta-analyses. The 
majority of included studies reported statistically significant detrimental associations of 
occupational standing with lower extremity, but not with upper extremity symptoms.  
Conclusions: The evidence suggests that ‘excessive’ occupational standing is associated with 
the occurrence of low-back and (inconclusively) lower extremity symptoms, but there may 
not be such an association with upper extremity symptoms. Only limited evidence from high 
quality, longitudinal studies using objectively measured standing was found.

analysis 
 
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: 
 There are high exposures to occupational standing in specific occupations and recent 
initiatives encouraging intermittent standing among white-collar workers. 
 In light of these (shifting) working styles, some concerns have been expressed that 
occupational standing may expose workers to risks of health consequences such as  
musculoskeletal symptoms. 
 The association of occupational standing with musculoskeletal symptoms is yet 
unclear, with no current systematic review quantifying this association.  
 
WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS: 
 We systematically reviewed literature and identified substantial evidence (50 articles 
from n=88,158 participants) describing associations of occupational standing with 
low-back, lower extremity and upper extremity symptoms. 
 We found evidence (including pooled data from a meta-analysis) for associations 
between occupational standing and the occurrence of low-back and (inconclusively) 
lower extremity symptoms, however not for upper extremity symptoms. 
 We found only limited evidence from high quality, longitudinal studies using 
objectively measured standing was found.  
 Such information is needed to provide more definitive evidence to inform good work 
design for both blue- and white-collar workers.

INTRODUCTION 
Exposure to extended periods of occupational standing is traditionally common among 
specific occupational groups, such as in the retail, food, healthcare, education, and 
manufacturing industries. For example, in a population of Australian workers, 62% reported 
working in a job that usually involved standing[1]; a finding consistent with that observed in 
a study conducted with a Canadian working population[2]. In a study with objectively 
measured standing (using thigh and hip worn accelerometers), it was shown that Danish 
blue-collar workers stood on average 2.2 (SD 1.3) hours per workday with subgroups 
standing for up to 3.7 (0.7) hours per workday[3].  
A recent and growing body of evidence suggests that excessive sitting is associated 
with several adverse health outcomes including poor cardio-metabolic health and premature 
mortality[4-6]. Consequently, there is a growing interest in workplace initiatives to reduce 
the amount of sitting time for sedentary workers[7], with expert recomendations advising 
workers to replace some sitting periods with standing and light activity at work[8], 
specifically by advocating regular postural changes (i.e. shifting between sitting, standing 
and moving). Replacing sitting with alternatives such as standing has been shown to be 
feasible[8 9] and is rapidly being implemented in many workplaces, such as through the 
introduction of sit/stand office workstations[10]. However, some concerns have been 
expressed that alternatives to sitting, such as standing, may expose workers to new hazards 
and/or other health consequences[11].  
In light of shifting working styles, a sound understanding of the health consequences 
of occupational standing is urgently needed to inform healthy work practice for both blue- 
and white-collar workers. Adverse health outcomes of standing have been reported 
 5 
 
before[12], with standing being associated with venous disorders of the lower 
extremities[13 14], perinatal health complications such as pre-term delivery and pre-
eclampsia[15], and musculoskeletal symptoms such as low-back and lower limb 
symptoms[16 17]. Despite this body of evidence, the association of occupational standing 
with musculoskeletal symptoms (e.g. self-reported pain, discomfort or complaints in regions 
of the musculoskeletal system) is yet unclear, with no current systematic review quantifying 
this association. The aims of this study were to systematically review the epidemiological 
evidence on the associations of occupational standing with non-specific musculoskeletal 
symptoms, and to quantify this association by means of meta-analyses.  
 
METHODS  
Search strategy 
To identify relevant publications, we performed systematic searches of the literature in the 
following bibliographic databases: Health & Safety Science Abstracts (Proquest); CINAHL 
(EBSCO); EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid); Embase 
(Ovid); Medline (Ovid); PsycInfo (Ovid). Searches were performed from database inception 
to 10 February 2015 with search terms including controlled key terms as well as free text 
terms. Search terms expressing ‘standing’ were used in combination with search terms for 
‘work-related’ (Appendix 1-6). No specific terms for ‘health outcomes’ were used as this 
study is part of larger review aimed at assessing the association of occupational standing and 
multiple health outcomes.  
Two reviewers independently screened all potentially relevant titles and abstracts for 
eligibility. If necessary, full-text articles were checked for eligibility. Differences in judgment 
were resolved through a consensus procedure. Studies were included if they met the 
 6 
 
following criteria: the article was an original epidemiological study published in a peer-
reviewed journal (i.e., excluding reviews, editorials or letters, theses and conference 
proceedings); it was published in English; and it reported on the association between 
occupational standing and any health problem. Only articles that described a general adult 
working population were included (e.g., studies selecting workers with chronic disorders and 
non-adult populations were excluded). Only studies quantifying the association of 
occupational standing with health outcomes were included (thereby excluding qualitative 
research). Studies in which occupational standing was not a main exposure variable of 
interest (e.g., standing was only part of a certain condition/trial such as ‘lifting during 
standing’), or in which occupational standing was only used as a confounding variable, were 
excluded.  
All eligible full-text articles were classified on exposure (work-related vs non-work 
related), outcome (musculoskeletal or other outcomes) and study design (e.g., laboratory 
study, cross-sectional study or longitudinal study). For the current study, only articles 
describing epidemiological cross-sectional (case-control or cross-sectional observational 
studies) or longitudinal observational studies on occupational standing and their association 
with musculoskeletal symptoms (i.e., self-reported pain, discomfort and/or complaints in 
any region of the musculoskeletal system) were included. Full-text versions of the selected 
articles were obtained for data extraction and quality assessment. In cases where full-text 
articles could not be found through online and/or offline databases, authors were contacted. 
Reference lists of selected articles were screened to identify additional potentially eligible 
articles.  
 
Data extraction and quality assessment 
 7 
 
Two reviewers independently assessed all selected articles for methodological quality and 
data extraction. In cases of disagreement, consensus was reached during a meeting. 
Methodological quality was evaluated using an adapted version of a published scoring 
system[18], based on eleven criteria for the reporting of study methods (description of 
recruitment, participants, allocation, measures, sample size) and results (description of 
variance, confounding, detail of results), with answer categories being ‘yes’, ‘partial’, ‘no’ 
and ‘not applicable’ (Appendix 7). Summary scores (ranging from 0 to 1) were calculated 
with:  
Summary score = Σ[(number of ‘yes’ × 2) + (number of ‘partial’ × 1)]/ Σ[22 − (number 
of ‘N/A’) × 2] 
Studies with a summary score ≥0.75 were considered to be of high methodological 
quality[18].  
For data extraction, the following data from each included article were obtained: first 
author and year of publication, study name, study design, sample description (i.e., number 
of participants, age, gender, occupation and country), confounders, exposure (assessment 
and operationalisation of occupational standing), outcome (assessment and 
operationalisation of musculoskeletal symptoms) and exposure-outcome estimates (e.g., 
odds ratios [ORs], relative risks [RR]). 
 
Data-analysis 
All included studies were described according to their methodological quality and extracted 
data. Included articles were categorised into body areas regarding their outcomes; i.e., low-
back symptoms, lower extremity symptoms, upper extremity symptoms and symptoms in 
any body area.  
 8 
 
In each of the four body areas, quantitative analyses of homogenous studies (with 
sufficient overlap in definitions of exposure, outcome, study population and study design for 
which small differences in definition of exposure and outcome were accepted[19]) were 
performed if possible. To be able to combine information from different studies, 
occupational standing was treated as a dichotomous variable for which a cut-off value of 4 
hours/workday was adopted (i.e., durations of standing below this threshold were 
considered ‘not excessive’ while durations of standing above this threshold were considered 
‘excessive’ standing). In the absence of any known ‘threshold’ for excessive standing, we 
selected this cut-off value based on the data provided in the identified studies with 4 
hours/workday being the most often reported (with sensitivity analysis examining other 
thresholds). The cut-off is also consistent with the recent recommendations for those 
occupations which are predominately desk-based whereby the eventual progression to a 
total accumulation of up to 4 hours/workday is advocated to offset the health hazards 
associated with excessive sitting[8]. Model parameters (i.e., unadjusted ORs; or cross-
tabulations of participants exposed to not excessive and excessive standing, with and 
without musculoskeletal symptoms) were retrieved from the original studies. If needed, 
exposure categories from studies reporting multiple occupational standing categories were 
collated. In instances where data provided in the published articles were insufficient, 
corresponding authors were contacted and asked for additional information.  
Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 was used to conduct meta-analyses and 
generate forest plots, using a random-effects model due to the heterogeneity of the studies. 
We report on ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CI) depicting each individual study as well 
as pooled exposure-outcome associations of excessive occupational standing and 
musculoskeletal symptoms, unadjusted for confounders. P-values <0.05 (two-sided) were 
 9 
 
considered statistically significant. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics and visual 
inspection of the forest plots were performed, while subgroup analyses were conducted 
using χ2 statistics. Funnel plots were generated to assess publication bias (through visual 
inspection).  
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of pooled-exposure 
associations. The sensitivity of the cut-off value for excessive occupational standing (4 
hours/workday) was tested by comparing those studies for which we could estimate 
exposure-outcome associations with a 4 hours/workday cut-off value to those for which we 
could estimate exposure-outcome associations with a 2 hours/workday cut-off value 
(performing subgroup analysis). Due to a lack of sufficient homogeneous data, we were not 
able to test for the effect of other cut-off values. In a second sensitivity analysis, we 
compared exposure-outcome associations unadjusted for confounders to exposure-outcome 
associations adjusted for confounders (e.g., gender, age, other physical or mental work 
demands). We also tested for differences in exposure-outcome associations of studies 
reporting on generic samples of workers (i.e., random samples of a general working 
population or samples of mixed occupational groups) compared to studies on samples of 
specific occupational groups (e.g., only hospital staff, only construction workers). In a final 
sensitivity analysis we tested for differences in exposure-outcome associations of studies 
with low compared to high methodological quality.  
 
RESULTS 
Data-description 
The flow chart of the search and selection process is presented in Figure 1. Our search 
strategy yielded a total of 15,857 search hits. After removing duplicates, 11,750 individual 
 10 
 
articles remained that were screened on their titles for inclusion. After excluding 10,951 
records, a total of 799 abstracts were screened after which 356 abstracts did not meet the 
inclusion criteria. A total of 11 full-text articles could not be retrieved (even after contacting 
corresponding authors), providing a total of 432 full-text articles that were screened on 
eligibility, of which 218 met the criteria of describing outcomes of occupational standing. A 
total of 44 of these articles specifically addressed the association of occupational standing 
and musculoskeletal symptoms using an epidemiological study design. After screening the 
reference lists of these articles, six more articles were added, resulting in a final total of 50 
articles (reporting 49 studies) included in the current review and used for methodological 
quality assessment and data-extraction (see Table 1 for a summary of findings)[17 20-68].

The methodological quality of all included articles is shown in Appendix 8. The 
average methodological quality of the included articles was 0.79 (SD: 0.16) out of 1, ranging 
from 0.23 to 1.00, with 32 articles describing a study considered to have high (≥0.75) 
methodological quality. Data extracted from the selected articles are presented in Appendix 
9. Seven articles reported on a cross-sectional case-control study[20 29 31 32 44 45 52], 38 a 
cross-sectional observational study[21-28 30 34-36 38-43 46-51 53-57 59-66 68] and five 
articles a longitudinal observational study[17 33 37 58 67]. Forty-six articles reported 
occupational standing assessed by self-reports[17 20 22-31 33-46 48-55 57-68], two articles 
described occupational standing assessed by observations[47 56] and two other articles 
described objectively measured (using accelerometers) occupational standing[21 32]. A total 
of 46 articles reported on samples of workers recruited from a general (not exclusively 
worker) population and/or a work population[17 20-23 26-43 45-51 53-68], while four 
others reported on data from samples of workers that were recruited through a clinical 
setting[24 25 44 52]. A total of 21 articles reported about random samples of the general 
(working) population or samples of mixed occupational groups[17 24-26 29 32 33 37 43-45 
47 48 50 52 55 58-61 66] and 29 articles reported about specific occupational groups, 
including health care workers[21-23 27 31 34-36 39-41 46 49 53 63 64 67], factory and 
assembly workers[28 30 56 57], teachers[54 68], farmers[51 65] and construction 
workers[38].  
 
Low-back symptoms 
A total of 39 articles (n=82,229 participants in total) reported on the association of 
occupational standing with back symptoms, of which 33 focused on low-back symptoms[17 
21 23-27 29 33-35 38-40 44-46 49 50 54-62 64-68] and six on back symptoms in general[22 
 13 
 
28 30 31 43 63] (all referred to as low-back symptoms from here). Sixteen articles (13 cross-
sectional studies[28 38 39 44-46 50 59-62 64 66] and three longitudinal studies[33 58 67], 
n=54,392 participants in total) provided sufficiently homogenous information to conduct a 
meta-analysis, pooling exposure-outcome associations on excessive occupational standing 
and low-back symptoms. This resulted in a pooled OR (with 95% CI) of 1.31[1.10 1.56], with 
I2=90% heterogeneity (Figure 2; Table 2). Associations found in studies with longitudinal 
study designs (1.17[0.64 2.14]) were not statistically significant and the point estimate was 
slightly weaker compared to studies with cross-sectional study designs (1.32[1.09 1.59]).

Sensitivity analyses showed that the association of excessive occupational standing 
and low-back symptoms did not statistically differ when the threshold for excessive 
occupational standing was set at 2 hours/workday compared to 4 hours/workday (χ2=0.02, 
p=0.88; Table 2, Appendix 10). Exposure-outcome associations unadjusted for confounders 
showed apparently stronger associations (1.32[1.09 1.59]) than those adjusted for 
confounders (1.23[1.02 1.47]), (Table 2, Appendix 11). Exposure-outcome associations from 
 14 
 
studies on samples of workers in general appeared stronger (1.40[1.20 1.62]) than from 
those on samples of specific occupational groups (1.24[0.86 1.78]), (Table 2, Appendix 12). 
Exposure-outcome association from studies with high methodological quality showed 
apparently stronger associations (1.38[1.16 1.64]) than those from studies with low 
methodological quality (1.25[0.85 1.82]), (Table 2, Appendix 13). Regarding publication bias, 
visual inspection of the funnel plot (Appendix 14) suggested some degree of asymmetry with 
some larger studies reporting lower ORs than smaller studies. 
The remaining 23 studies (n=27,899 participants) that reported on the association 
between occupational standing and low-back symptoms could not be used in our meta-
analysis as insufficient homogeneous evidence was provided. Nine studies reported on 
significant positive (i.e., excessive standing being associated with the occurrence of low-back 
symptoms) associations[17 21 24 30 35 40 49 63 68], eight studies reported on comparable 
but non-significant associations[22 25 27 29 34 55 56 65] while in another six studies 
associations of occupational standing and low-back symptoms were assessed, but the 
outcomes of these associations were not reported (nor provided by the authors upon 
request)[23 26 54] [31 43 57]. These studies varied substantially in their definitions for 
exposure, outcome and exposure-outcome associations. Regarding variation in definitions of 
exposure for example, one study showed that there was a significantly higher prevalence of 
low-back symptoms for workers who reported that their ‘work was hampered by standing’ 
compared to workers who reported that their ‘work was hampered by sitting’ (OR with 95% 
CI; 3.07[1.88 5.01][31]. In comparison, Hill and colleagues showed that the prevalence of 
low-back symptoms was higher by every hour of occupational standing, though confidence 
intervals were wide (OR with 95% CI; 2.96[0.73 12.10])[34]. Substantial heterogeneity 
existed in the definitions of low-back symptoms (e.g., with studies reporting on pain, 
 15 
 
discomfort and complaints, acute and chronic and even low-back symptoms exacerbated by 
occupational standing)[24 25]. Finally, some studies reported on exposure-outcome 
associations using metrics other than ORs, such as correlations[40], prevalence rates 
(PRs)[29 56] and hazard ratios (HR)[17].  
 
 
Lower extremity symptoms 
A total of 14 articles (n=31,924 participants) reported on the association between 
occupational standing and lower extremity symptoms. Three articles were on lower 
extremity symptoms in general[29 31 43], one on hip/knee/feet symptoms combined[17], 
two on hip symptoms[52 65], six on knee symptoms[37 46 48 50 57 65], two on feet 
symptoms[47 48], two on upper leg symptoms[28 48] and three on lower leg symptoms[28 
35 48].  
Eight studies reported that excessive occupational standing was significantly 
associated with a higher prevalence of lower extremity symptoms (with point estimate ORs 
ranging from 1.23 to 3.95)[17 28 31 35 43 46-48]. Four studies reported comparable but 
non-statistically significant exposure-outcome associations (with point estimate ORs ranging 
from 1.10 to 1.70)[29 37 52 65]. One study found that excessive occupational standing was 
associated with a significantly lower prevalence of lower extremity symptoms [65]. There 
were an additional four studies in which the association of occupational standing and lower 
extremity symptoms was assessed, but the outcomes of these associations were not 
reported[47 50 57] [17]. 
 
Upper extremity symptoms 
 16 
 
A total of 18 articles (n=25,708 participants) reported on the association of occupational 
standing and upper extremity symptoms, of which three articles focused on upper extremity 
symptoms in general[29 31 43], five on neck/shoulder symptoms[17 27 32 56 68], 10 on 
neck symptoms[22 28 34 35 40 43 46 57 63 65], seven on shoulder symptoms[22 28 34 35 50 
57 63], seven on forearm/hand and/or finger symptoms[17 22 28 34 50 56 65] and one on 
arm-only symptoms[28].  
Four studies reported excessive occupational standing to be significantly associated 
with a higher prevalence of upper extremity symptoms[17 31 32 40], nine studies reported 
comparable but non statistically significant exposure-outcome associations[22 28 29 34 46 
56 57 63 68] while one study found that excessive occupational standing was associated with 
a lower prevalence of upper extremity symptoms[28]. There were another ten studies in 
which the association of occupational standing and upper extremity symptoms was 
assessed, but the outcomes of these associations were not reported[17 27 28 31 35 43 46 50 
57 65].  
 
Symptoms in any body area 
Eight articles (n=3,114 participants) reported on the association of occupational standing 
with musculoskeletal symptoms in any body area[17 20 36 41 42 46 51 53]. Three studies 
reported that excessive occupational standing was significantly associated with a higher 
prevalence of symptoms. For example, significant associations for excessive standing with 
symptoms were found for standing more compared to less than 30 minutes/hour (HR with 
95%CI) 1.6[1.2 2.3])[17] and for standing more or less than 4 hours/workday (OR with 95% 
CI) 3.67[1.88 7.17])[51]. One study reported excessive occupational standing to be 
associated with a reduced prevalence of symptoms compared to rarely standing (OR; 
 17 
 
0.56[0.34 0.94])[36]. Two studies reported on non-significant associations of occupational 
standing and symptoms in any body area[41 53]. Two studies in which the association of 
occupational standing and lower extremity symptoms was assessed reported no outcomes 
of these associations [46] [42].  
 
DISCUSSION 
Meta-analysis evidence from 16 articles with 54,392 participants suggested a statistically 
significant association between excessive occupational standing and the occurrence of low-
back symptoms with a pooled OR (with 95% CI) of 1.31[1.10 1.56]. The association remained 
whether the cut-off value for excessive occupational standing was 2 or 4 hours/workday, 
however due to insufficient data we could not explore other cut-off values (e.g., 6 
hours/workday). Therefore, at present we cannot draw conclusions on the dose-response 
association of excessive standing and low-back symptoms (i.e., how much standing should 
be considered excessive). Also evidence from studies not analysed in the meta-analysis (23 
articles with n=27,899 participants) indicated an association of excessive occupational 
standing with the occurrence of low-back symptoms. Our findings are broadly in line with 
what has been reported in a (non-systematic) review previously[12]. Further evidence (from 
high quality, longitudinal studies using objectively measured occupational standing) and data 
from laboratory studies is needed to help determine the exposure-outcome relationship, 
understand the mechanisms (e.g., muscle fatigue[69] and postural changes[70 71]), and 
provide evidence for thresholds of excessive standing.  
Although we were not able to perform a meta-analysis for the association of 
occupational standing and lower limb symptoms, the available evidence suggests (although 
inconclusively) an association between excessive occupational standing and the occurrence 
 18 
 
of lower extremity symptoms. These findings are in line with what has been reported 
before[16 66]. Similar to the associations for occupational standing with low-back 
symptoms, future epidemiological and laboratory research may help to explain the 
association between excessive occupational standing and lower extremity symptoms, may 
provide evidence for thresholds of excessive standing and should be explored to understand 
the mechanisms (e.g. muscle fatigue[72] and other non-musculoskeletal vascular 
mechanisms such as swelling[73] due to blood pooling in the lower limbs[69]). Evidence to 
date does not indicate a significant association of occupational standing and upper limb 
symptoms (either positive or negative).  
 
Methodological considerations  
Substantial evidence on the association of occupational standing with musculoskeletal 
symptoms was found (with data from n=88,158 participants). However due to the large 
heterogeneity between studies, data were difficult to synthesise. Sources of heterogeneity 
included: differences in the definitions of the exposure (i.e., occupational standing) and 
outcome (i.e., musculoskeletal symptoms); differences in study designs and study samples; 
and, the methodological quality of the identified studies.  
The majority of the articles described studies that were based on cross-sectional 
designs, and thus inferences in regards to causality – including the direction of the 
associations - cannot be determined. While the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms as 
a result of exposure to occupational standing is discussed in most of the identified evidence 
(taking a traditional ergonomics perspective), it could also be possible that participants with 
symptoms adopt different activity behaviours than participants without symptoms[74], with 
variation in posture often seen as a strategy for relief from pain[75]. In the subset of studies 
 19 
 
that used a longitudinal design a weaker and not statistically significant association was 
found, reinforcing the need for caution in interpreting the cross-sectional findings. 
The vast majority of the studies assessed occupational standing by self-report 
measures. Objective measures of occupational exposure are preferred[76], and are better 
able to detect true exposure-outcome associations[77]. Moreover, objective measures (e.g. 
using posture based monitors) allow for a more detailed assessment of activities (such as 
standing) that include not just the total amount of activities, but also patterns of activities. 
For example, a single four-hour period of static standing is likely to have different 
musculoskeletal consequences than four hours of standing accrued in short (e.g. <20 
minute) bouts throughout the workday. There was also substantial variation in the 
operationalisation of occupational standing (e.g., standing in hours/day, hours/week, 
minutes/hour or even years of exposure). Similarly, the variation in the definitions of 
musculoskeletal symptoms were substantial, with variation in period (e.g., symptoms in the 
last 7 days, last month or last year), operationalisation of the symptoms (e.g., defining the 
intensity of symptoms or the yes/no presence of symptoms), and body area of symptoms. 
Harmonizing certain definitions would enhance synthesis of the evidence. 
We found stronger associations in studies with high methodological quality 
compared to those with low methodological quality, supporting the value of high quality 
studies. It should be noted though that the methodological quality scale did not distinguish 
cross-sectional from longitudinal studies. One of the issues around methodological quality 
was the adjustment for confounders (or not). Heterogeneity in adjustments for confounding 
(i.e., in the variables -if any- used) was too great to allow meta-analysis on associations 
adjusted for confounders. However, sensitivity analysis showed weaker associations among 
evidence from studies that adjusted for confounders. This suggests the importance of 
 20 
 
considering confounding or mediating variables (including gender, age, other physical or 
mental work demands and previous musculoskeletal symptoms) that could explain or modify 
the association of occupational standing with musculoskeletal symptoms. These findings 
suggest that the current results (that are mainly based on unadjusted associations) should 
be interpreted with care, and that influencing variables should be considered in future 
research.  
Studies with samples that included various occupations (i.e., a combination of various 
occupations or random samples of a general working population) had stronger exposure-
outcome associations than those that were reported from specific occupational groups (e.g., 
health care, factory or construction workers), although no significant subgroup differences 
were observed. These specific occupational groups are likely to have a similar occupational 
exposure (i.e., either standing a lot, or sitting a lot) and a lack of within-group variation in 
occupational standing and symptoms may explain the weaker exposure-outcome 
associations found[78]. The ‘healthy-worker-effect’, in which workers without symptoms are 
more likely to remain in physically demanding jobs[79], may also play a role in these 
findings.  
With some level of asymmetry in the funnel plot from studies that were included in 
the meta-analysis and a number of studies not reporting on (potentially non-significant) 
associations, publication bias might be present. Current results should therefore be 
interpreted with caution.  
 
CONCLUSION 
This systematic review found evidence for associations between ‘excessive’ occupational 
standing and the occurrence of low-back symptoms (pooled OR of 1.31[1.10 1.56]) and 
 21 
 
(inconclusively) lower extremity symptoms. The evidence did not support a significant or 
meaningful association of occupational standing with upper extremity symptoms. More 
information from high quality, longitudinal studies using objectively measured occupational 
standing and well-characterised symptom outcomes is needed in order to provide more 
definitive evidence to inform good work design.
