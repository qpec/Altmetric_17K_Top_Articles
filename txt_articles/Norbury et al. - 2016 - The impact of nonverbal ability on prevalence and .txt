Background: Diagnosis of ‘specific’ language impairment traditionally required nonverbal IQ to be within normal
limits, often resulting in restricted access to clinical services for children with lower NVIQ. Changes to DSM-5 criteria
for language disorder removed this NVIQ requirement. This study sought to delineate the impact of varying NVIQ
criteria on prevalence, clinical presentation and functional impact of language disorder in the first UK population
study of language impairment at school entry. Methods: A population-based survey design with sample weighting
procedures was used to estimate population prevalence. We surveyed state-maintained reception classrooms
(n = 161 or 61% of eligible schools) in Surrey, England. From a total population of 12,398 children (ages 4–5 years),
7,267 (59%) were screened. A stratified subsample (n = 529) received comprehensive assessment of language, NVIQ,
social, emotional and behavioural problems, and academic attainment. Results: The total population prevalence
estimate of language disorder was 9.92% (95% CI 7.38, 13.20). The prevalence of language disorder of unknown
origin was estimated to be 7.58% (95% CI 5.33, 10.66), while the prevalence of language impairment associated with
intellectual disability and/or existing medical diagnosis was 2.34% (95% CI 1.40, 3.91). Children with language
disorder displayed elevated symptoms of social, emotional and behavioural problems relative to peers, F(1,
466) = 7.88, p = .05, and 88% did not make expected academic progress. There were no differences between those
with average and low-average NVIQ scores in severity of language deficit, social, emotional and behavioural
problems, or educational attainment. In contrast, children with language impairments associated with known
medical diagnosis and/or intellectual disability displayed more severe deficits on multiple measures. Conclusions:
At school entry, approximately two children in every class of 30 pupils will experience language disorder
severe enough to hinder academic progress. Access to specialist clinical services should not depend on NVIQ.
Keywords: Developmental language disorder; NVIQ discrepancy; prevalence; functional impairment.
Introduction
Developmental language disorder is a public health
concern (Law, Reilly, & Snow, 2013), associated with
increased risk of school failure (Tomblin, 2008), poor
employment outcomes (Conti-Ramsden & Durkin,
2012) and social, emotional, and behaviour prob-
lems (Yew & O’Kearney, 2013). Estimating preva-
lence
and
planning
services
for
children
with
language disorder is hampered by a lack of consen-
sus concerning key inclusion and exclusion criteria
(Bishop, 2014). There is little agreement regarding
the level of language deficit that results in functional
impairment and considerable debate about the role
of NVIQ in diagnosis and treatment. For example,
ICD-10 criteria for language disorders (World Health
Organisation, 1992) specify severe language deficits
(�2SD or more) in the context of average NVIQ,
yielding a significant discrepancy between verbal
and nonverbal abilities. Similarly, NVIQ below the
average range (below �1SD, equivalent to standard
scores below 85 and in some cases below 90) is the
most common exclusion criterion for admission to
specialist speech-language therapy services in Eng-
land (Dockrell, Lindsay, Letchford, & Mackie, 2006)
and Ireland (Dept for Education, Co. Westmeath,
2005), regardless of the severity of language impair-
ment. This creates a group of children with consid-
erable language needs who fall between diagnostic
categories because they do not meet criteria for
specific
language
intervention
services
(because
their nonverbal abilities are too impaired), nor do
they meet criteria for education provisions catering
for children with learning disabilities (because their
NVIQ deficits are not severe enough). The 5th revi-
sion of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental
Disorders
(DSM-5:
American
Psychiatric
Association, 2013) removed reference to NVIQ in
the criteria for developmental language disorder,
providing children do not meet the criteria for
intellectual disability. Such differences in diagnostic
criteria may yield substantially different prevalence

 estimates, and potentially identify children with
disparate clinical needs.
Existing language and NVIQ criteria are entirely
arbitrary, as the extent to which diagnostic criteria
are associated with functional impacts in education
or social, emotional and behavioural development
has not been systematically tested in the general
population. An investigation of children at increased
biological or psychosocial risk of language disorder
considered varying language and NVIQ criteria on
prevalence (Weindrich, Jennen-Steinmetz, Laucht,
Esser, & Schmidt, 2000). Strict application of ICD-
10 criteria yielded a prevalence estimate of 2.2% at
age 4, while broadening criteria to include children
with a language deficit of �1.5SD and low-average
NVIQ (scores between �2SD and �1SD) trebled the
prevalence estimate. Importantly, children meeting
ICD-10 criteria were most likely to spontaneously
resolve language deficits by age 8, while peers with
low-average NVIQ had persistent language disorders
and were more likely to develop literacy problems.
Poor prognosis in this study may have been con-
founded by the presence of additional risk factors.
Population studies are necessary to explore the
relationship between language, NVIQ and functional
impact in unbiased cohorts. To date, previous inves-
tigations have either excluded children with low-
average NVIQ, did not compare those with average
and low-average IQ, or failed to measure functional
impact (Beitchman, Nair, Clegg, & Patel, 1986; Eadie
et al., 2014; McLeod & Harrison, 2009; Silva, McGee,
& Williams, 2008; Stevenson & Richman, 1976;
Tomblin et al., 1997). In addition, the severity of
language deficit required to meet criteria for disor-
der varies widely, affecting prevalence estimates.
The most commonly cited prevalence estimate of
7.4% (Tomblin et al., 1997) required an overall
language deficit of �1.12SD in the context of average
(standard score > 87) NVIQ. However, these criteria
identified a large number of false positives, with
fewer than
50% of children meeting
the same
criteria for language disorder 1 year later (Tomblin,
Zhang, Buckwalter, & O’Brien, 2003), and only 29%
attracting
parent
or
clinical
concern
(Zhang
&
Tomblin, 2000).
The use of NVIQ as an exclusionary criterion for
language
disorder
has
been
questioned
(Reilly,
Bishop, & Tomblin, 2014). There are consistent
relationships between severity of language disorder
and lower NVIQ (Conti-Ramsden, St Clair, Pickles, &
Durkin, 2012; Gallinat & Spaulding, 2014), no
aetiological
differences
between
those
with
and
without discrepant abilities (Bishop, North, & Don-
lan, 1995), and no evidence that children with low-
average NVIQ cannot benefit from clinical interven-
tions (Reilly, Bishop, et al., 2014); such findings
have motivated the DSM-5 change in diagnostic
criteria for language disorder. This change has
raised concerns that higher prevalence rates will
increase burden on clinical and educational services
to accommodate children with more severe, persis-
tent and pervasive language disorder (Reilly, Tom-
blin, et al., 2014). Evidence concerning the influence
of NVIQ on quantitative or qualitative differences in
the clinical presentation of children with language
disorder is urgently needed. In addition, while clas-
sification systems such as DSM-5 specify a criterion
of functional impairment, none delineate how this
should be operationalized, and no previous epidemi-
ological study has implemented a measure of func-
tional impact.
Our study is the first UK population study of
language disorder at school entry and the first to
attempt to implement DSM-5 criteria. We consider
for the first time the functional impact of language
disorder with particular focus on academic achieve-
ment. In addition, we compare children with average
and low-average NVIQ scores to estimate the influ-
ence of NVIQ on severity of language deficit, associ-
ated social, emotional and behavioural problems,
and related functional disorder during the first
school years.
Methods
Study population
The Surrey Communication and Language in Education Study
(SCALES) used a two-phase design. In the first phase, all state-
maintained primary schools in Surrey, England were invited
(n = 263 schools) and data were obtained for 7,267 children
who began a reception class (similar to kindergarten or school
entry) in 2011 (response rate: 61% of all eligible schools and
59% of all eligible children, Figure 1). Participating schools
(n = 161) did not differ from those that opted out (n = 102) on
measures of socioeconomic disadvantage (percentage of chil-
dren receiving free school meals, t(261) = 1.38, p = .17); chil-
dren in receipt of a statement of special educational need (a
legal document stipulating the services the local education
authority is required to provide to support language, learning
or behavioural problems within school), t(261) = 0.19, p = .85;
or children speaking English as an additional language,
t(232) = 1.05, p = .29. All children were aged between 4 years;
9 months and 5 years; 10 months at the time of assessment,
in the summer (3rd) term. Although Surrey is a relatively
affluent county compared with the national average, children
were screened from across the social strata. Income Depriva-
tion Affecting Children Index scores obtained from home
postcodes
provided
a
measure
of
socioeconomic
status
reflecting
neighbourhood
deprivation
(McLennan,
Barnes,
Davies, Garratt, & Dibben, 2011). Index scores in England
range from 1 (most deprived) to 32,844 (mean for England
in 2010 = 16,241), and in this sample ranged from 731
(most deprived) to 32,474 (most affluent) (mean = 21,592,
SD = 7,830).
In the second phase, a subsample was selected for in-depth
assessment in Year 1 (first grade, ages 5;1 – 6;10) using
stratified random sampling. Initial strata identified children
who were reported as having ‘no phrase speech’ (NPS, n = 89,
1.2%), those attending special schools for severe and complex
learning disabilities (n = 31, including 19 NPS, 0.4%) and
those for whom English was an additional language (n = 782,
10.7%, including 27 NPS). Children in special schools were
excluded from further study; given their complex learning
disabilities school staff felt they would be unable to participate
in the assessments. Children with English as an additional
language were invited to a different study and not included

 here. All remaining children with NPS (n = 48) were invited for
in-depth assessment.
For remaining monolingual children, cut-off scores on the
teacher-rated
Children’s
Communication
Checklist-Short
(CCC-S; from CCC-2, Bishop, 2003a) were used for each of
three age-groups (autumn, spring and summer born) to
identify sex-specific strata of boys (13.9%) and girls (14.8%)
with likely poorer language for age and sex (roughly equivalent
to 1SD above expected range for sex and age group). At this
stage we used sex-specific cut-off scores, in part because of the
significant increase in summer-born boys rated by teachers as
having potential language deficits. In addition to the 48
children with NPS, a random sample of 588 were drawn from
the total 6411 with a higher sampling fraction for the high-risk
children (40.5% boys, 37.5% girls) versus low-risk children
(4.3% boys, 4.2% girls). Although boys were identified in Phase
1 as high-risk at a ratio of 2:1 (Norbury et al., 2016), we
oversampled girls to ensure sufficient numbers of both sex to
address potential sex differences in prevalence rates and/or
clinical
profile.
However,
our
weighting
procedures
take
account of this sampling design (i.e. boy scores carry greater
‘weight’) and therefore reported estimates reflect the entire
screened sample distribution.
Consent procedures
Opt-out consent was adopted for the first phase as data could
be provided anonymously to the research team; 20 families
opted out. In the second phase of direct assessment, written,
informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal
guardians of all participants. Consent procedures and study
protocol were developed in consultation with Surrey County
Council and approved by the Research Ethics Committee at
Royal Holloway, University of London.
Screening procedures
Screening data were obtained between May–July 2012. The
primary screen was the teacher-completed CCC-S, a brief
version of the CCC-2 (Bishop, 2003a), which contains 13 items
rated on a 4-point scale that best discriminated cases and
controls in a validation study (Norbury, Nash, Baird, & Bishop,
2004). Scores ranged from 0 to 39; higher scores reflect greater
disorder. Children with ‘no phrase speech’ (NPS), that is, not
yet combining words into phrases or sentences, received the
maximum score of 39 (1.2% of total population).

Language disorder: prevalence and clinical profile

 Teachers also completed the Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire (SDQ: Goodman, 1997), a well-validated ques-
tionnaire rating social, emotional and behavioural (SEB)
strengths and weakness. The Total Difficulties subscale con-
tains 20 items rated on a 3-point scale, with higher scores
reflecting increased difficulties (maximum score = 40), and a
cut-off score of 16 or greater indicative of clinically significant
SEB problems (most extreme 10% of validation sample,
Goodman, 1997). Functional impact was measured using the
Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (EYFSP: Department for
Education, 2013), a nationally applied measure of academic
attainment for children attending state-maintained reception
classes in England. Children achieving a ‘good level of devel-
opment’ made expected or exceeded progress on 12 key
curriculum targets (Cotzias & Whitehorn, 2013). Teachers also
reported existing clinical diagnoses (e.g. autism spectrum
disorder, Down syndrome) and receipt of extra educational
support, including school action (teachers provide additional
input and measure progress), involvement of external agencies
(referral to speech-language therapy or educational psychol-
ogy) and/or a statement of special educational need (a legally
binding document specifying educational support required).
In-depth assessment procedure
Assessment data were obtained from 39/48 children with NPS
(87.5% of girls, 78.0% of boys) and 490/588 children with
phrase speech (80.3% of girls and 80.6% of boys) whose
families gave consent for participation. This represents 3.6%
low-risk girls, 3.7% low-risk boys, 31.4% high-risk girls and
31.5% high-risk boys from the total population screened.
In-depth assessment closely followed procedures which
have informed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria (see supplementary
material for descriptions of all assessment measures). NVIQ
was estimated using a composite of block design and matrix
reasoning (Wechsler, 2003). Children were banded according
to IQ performance as ‘average’ (�1SD or better), ‘low-average’
(between �1SD and �2SD) and ‘intellectual disability’ (�2SD or
lower), reflecting previous research criteria and current edu-
cational practice. Speech intelligibility was assessed using a
single word speech sample and reported as per cent conso-
nants correct (Dodd, Zhu, Crosbie, Holm, & Ozanne, 2002).
Five language composites included expressive and receptive
vocabulary (Brownell, 2010); receptive and expressive gram-
mar (Bishop, 2003b, Marinis, Chiat, Armon-Lotem, Piper, &
Roy, 2011); narrative retelling and comprehension (Adams,
Cooke, Crutchley, Hesketh, & Reeves, 2001); and expressive
and receptive composites comprised of the relevant vocabu-
lary, grammar and narrative indices (see supporting informa-
tion). Language disorder was defined as scores of �1.5SD or
below on two of five language composites in the absence of
intellectual disability and/or existing medical diagnosis. This
cut-off is consistent with earlier population studies of language
disorder (Silva et al., 2008; Stevenson & Richman, 1976),
studies of language disorder in other clinical populations
(Loucas et al., 2008) and current clinical practice.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using svy procedures in
Stata-14 (Stata Corporation, 2015). Since the probability of
being included in the second stage depended on language-level
(we oversampled those with language deficits), sex (we over-
sampled girls), and school size (larger schools were more likely
to be selected), the data from the second stage participants
were weighted by the inverse of the probability of selection.
This weighted sample thus ‘looked like’ the first stage sample
giving proportions, percentages and means that were estimates
for the whole population of monolingual children starting
school in state-maintained schools. Confidence intervals and
test statistics were based on robust standard errors that
properly reflected sampling variability in weighted estimates.
Since several measures had no, out-of-date or inapplicable
published norms, the raw scores on these assessments were
adjusted for child age and were standardised using the current
weighted sample using the LMS procedure (Cole & Green,
1992) (similar to the procedures used to construct paediatric
height and weight charts). These are reported as z-scores with
a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Missing data
Household postcodes were unavailable for 148 children and
were replaced with the child’s school postcode. One child was
missing both SDQ and EYFSP scores and six were missing
EYFSP scores due to teachers exiting the on-line screen before
completion. The screen required a response to each individual
item before teachers could progress to the next item, thus there
were no further missing data.
Complete data sets on the language composites and non-
verbal cognitive ability composite were available for 506/529
children participating in in-depth assessment. Incomplete test
data were largely attributed to child unable/unwilling to
complete particular tasks (65.22% of incomplete test scores
were from children with ‘no phrase speech’ who were unable to
provide verbal responses to expressive language tasks), ren-
dering the total score unreliable. In these cases (n = 22), the
senior investigator (CN) used the completed test data to classify
children as language impaired or not. Missing scores for these
participants were not imputed, but the weights take account of
these missing data. The weighted frequencies are therefore
estimates for the whole mainstream school population in Year
1 (ages 5;1 – 6;10; excluding those with English as an
additional language).
Results
We present the estimated frequencies in the target-
screened population obtained after weighting for the
design and nonparticipation effects (raw frequency
counts are available in Table 1). The first analyses
(Tables S1 and S2) identified children with existing
medical diagnoses and/or intellectual disability. The
estimated frequency was 307 children, of whom 151
also met our criteria for language disorder (preva-
lence: 2.34%, 95% CI: 1.40, 3.91). Table 1 reports
prevalence estimates for language disorder of cur-
rently unknown origin, an estimated frequency of
488 (prevalence: 7.58% of population, 95% CI 5.33,
10.66). Of those children meeting criteria for lan-
guage disorder, 309 had NVIQ scores within the
average range (4.80%, 95% CI 3.06, 7.44), while 179
had low-average scores (2.78%, 95% CI 1.57, 4.86).
Note that our estimates do not include children
already attending special schools for children with
complex learning needs (less than 1% of the popu-
lation at school entry) and thus slightly underesti-
mate the total number of children with language
disorder in the population.
For comparison, Table 1 also reports prevalence
estimates using Tomblin et al. (1997) criteria (7.74%;
the same criteria including children with low-average
NVIQ increases this estimate to 11.11%), and chil-
dren meeting ICD-10 discrepancy criteria (1.07%).

Language disorder: prevalence and clinical profile

 relaxing the NVIQ cut-off score increases the preva-
lence estimate by approximately 50%. Most strik-
ingly, very few children meet strict ICD-10 criteria,
largely because so many children obtain intermedi-
ate discrepancy scores.
Tables 1 and 2 also document the functional
impairment
associated
with
language
disorder;
88% of children meeting SCALES criteria for lan-
guage disorder failed to achieve a ‘good level of
development’ on the EYFSP, compared with 30% of
typically
developing
peers,
F(1,
466) = 32.21,
p < .001. Children with language disorder also dis-
played increased levels of social, emotional and
behaviour
difficulties,
F(1,
466) = 7.78,
p = .05.
Table S2 compares these children to those for whom
language impairment occurs in the context of a
known diagnosis and/or intellectual disability. The
latter group has significantly more severe language
deficits and almost 50% have reported clinically
significant social, emotional and behavioural defi-
cits, yet the two groups did not differ significantly in
terms of academic attainment, at least during the
first year of school.
Figure 2 depicts the language profiles of children
with language disorder (of currently unknown origin)
by NVIQ band. In general, there were no differences
in overall severity of language impairment. Those
with lower NVIQ did have significantly more severe
expressive
language
deficits,
F(1,
90) = 4.01,
p = .05, a composite score which is comprised of
expressive vocabulary, sentence recall and narrative
recall. Both sentence recall and narrative tasks tap
memory skills as well as vocabulary and grammar
and
may
therefore
be
particularly
sensitive
to
broader cognitive deficits. There were, however, no
differences between those with average and low-
average NVIQ with regard to any other language
composite,
age,
socioeconomic
status,
symptom
severity on the SDQ-Total Difficulties scale or EYFSP
total raw scores (Table 3). Thus, for children with
language disorder, low-average NVIQ was not asso-
ciated with a more social disadvantage, a more
severe language impairment, more severe social,
emotional and behavioural problems or poorer aca-
demic attainment.
There
were
no
significant
sex
differences
in
prevalence estimates for language disorder (1.22:1
males:females), despite significant sex differences
at screening in which twice as many boys were
identified as ‘high-risk’. In contrast, the rate of
language disorder associated with existing medical
diagnosis and/or intellectual disability was much
higher in males, 3.31:1 (Table S2). In general, for
those with language disorder (in the absence of
known
diagnosis/intellectual
impairment)
there
were no differences between males and females in
severity of language composite scores, although
there was a small, but significant difference in the
grammar composite, in which girls obtained sco-
res
indicating
more
severe
grammatical
deficits
(Figure S1).
Despite early and significant impacts on academic
progress, fewer than half of those with language

 diagnoses and/or intellectual impairment were not
any more likely to be referred to speech-language
therapy services, but a significantly greater percent-
age of children in this category (31%) were in receipt
of a statement of special educational need relative to
those with language disorder (3%). The types of
support available vary considerably but most often
involve time with a learning support assistant in the
classroom.
Discussion
We estimated the prevalence of language disorder
using a population screening procedure followed
by a comprehensive assessment. Our prevalence
estimate of 7.58% suggests that approximately two
children in every Year 1 classroom of 30 children will
have a clinically significant language disorder of
currently unknown cause that adversely impacts
learning. We also estimated the prevalence of lan-
guage impairment associated with existing medical
diagnoses and/or intellectual disorder (2.34%), a
group with more severe language deficits and a high
proportion of children with clinically significant
social, emotional and behavioural difficulties. Our
estimates are based on a population of children in
mainstream classrooms and do not include children
in special schools for children with complex learning
needs or children with English as an additional
language. In addition, our cohort is taken from a
relatively affluent county in Southeast England. For
these reasons our prevalence estimates should be

Language disorder: prevalence and clinical profile
1253
 considered the minimum estimate of need and may
be higher in other areas.
Our study focused on prevalence, or the percent-
age of the target population experiencing language
disorder at a given time, and did not measure
incidence, which is the number of new cases of
language disorder per population at risk within a
given time period. Incidence rates are more difficult
to estimate, but are important in understanding time
trends and possible causes. However, it is notewor-
thy that despite more than 20 years between stud-
ies,
different
assessment
measures
and
school
environments, our prevalence estimate is broadly
similar to the most widely cited epidemiological
study (Tomblin et al., 1997), which used methods
and language constructs similar to our own and
which has informed DSM-5 criteria for language
disorder. A key difference between these two studies
is that SCALES criteria used a more severe cut-off
score for language severity (�1.5SD) and included
children with a broader range of nonverbal IQ scores,
whereas Tomblin et al. only included children with
NVIQ scores above 87. Employing the same language
cut-off as Tomblin et al., 1997, but increasing the
NVIQ range to include all children who did not meet
criteria
for
intellectual
disability
dramatically
increased the prevalence estimate to 11.11%. This
figure stands in stark contrast to the ICD-10 esti-
mate, in which children’s language is below both age
and cognitive ability, and a significant discrepancy
between verbal and nonverbal abilities is required.
Only 1.07% of children met these strict criteria; such
criteria appear to lack face validity as many children
with significant need would be excluded from such a
diagnosis.
This study is the first to measure explicitly, at a
population level, the impact of relaxing NVIQ criteria
in the DSM-5 on both prevalence and clinical profile
of language disorder. Children with ‘low-average’
NVIQ scores did not generally experience more
severe language deficits, educational difficulties, or
social, emotional and behavioural problems. Thus,
there is no a priori reason to exclude such children
from
specialist
clinical
or
educational
services
(Dockrell et al., 2006). Previous studies have high-
lighted low-average NVIQ as a marker of persistent
language
disorder
(Stothard,
Snowling,
Bishop,
Chipchase, & Kaplan, 1998), associated with more
severe academic challenges over time. We acknowl-
edge that the causes of language disorder associated
with concomitant low-average NVIQ may be distinct
and may warrant different treatment approaches.
Intervention studies that systematically test the
influence of NVIQ on response to treatment are
therefore needed to develop best practice guidelines.
This study is also the first to include a measure of
functional impact, a nationally applied measure of
academic attainment. There was a clear association
between SCALES criteria for language disorder and
academic disadvantage, with only 11% of affected
children achieving curriculum targets in the first
year of school (14% of those with language impair-
ment in the context of a known diagnosis and/or
intellectual impairment). Longitudinal investigations
have reported increased risk for literacy disorders
and continued scholastic underachievement, often
associated with higher rates of emotional, social and
behavioural deficit (Tomblin, Zhang, Buckwalter, &
Catts, 2000). Thus, developing language skills that
enable children to access the curriculum and sup-
port social, emotional and behavioural development
is a key priority for clinical services.
We
also
acknowledge
that
we
operationalized
DSM-5 criteria to require disorder in two of five
language composite scores and used a more severe,
but still arbitrary, cut-off for language disorder at
�1.5SD (or approximately the bottom 7th centile).
This cut-off score is consistent with identification of
language disorder in other clinical conditions (Lou-
cas et al., 2008) and in this sample is closely aligned
with functional impairment in school attainment. In
comparison, the more lenient cut-off employed by
Tomblin et al. (1997) identified a large number of
false positives, and in the current sample 2/3 of
children meeting these criteria exhibited associated
functional impacts. While none of the children
meeting ICD-10 diagnostic criteria achieved early
curriculum targets, the number of children who met
criteria was too low and excluded too many children
with language and learning needs to be clinically
meaningful. Nevertheless, longitudinal follow-up of
the current cohort will be essential to establishing

 the diagnostic framework with the most appropriate
criteria for identifying children with persistent lan-
guage disorders and associated functional impacts.
The sex ratio (1.22:1, male:female) for language
disorder
is
similar
to
previous
epidemiological
reports (Beitchman et al., 1986; Tomblin et al.,
1997), although the sex ratio for language impair-
ment associated with known medical diagnoses
and/or intellectual disorder is much higher, due in
part to the high percentage (33%) of children with
autism diagnoses within this group. Despite similar
rates and severity of language disorder between
sexes, there were differences in identification and
referral to clinical services. While more boys were
identified at screening as being at risk, girls were
more likely to be referred to clinical services. We did
take a sex-specific cut-off on the CCC-S, largely to
account for the confounds between sex, age group
and teacher ratings at screening. Had we not done
this, our intensively assessed cohort would have
included a large proportion of summer-born boys,
many of whom would likely have resolved early
language delays. Nevertheless, our sample weighting
procedures
take
account
of
this
and
thus
the
reported scores reflect gender distributions in the
screened population. Therefore, the differences in
assessed outcome (which did not use sex-specific
cut-offs) or referral patterns are not due to sampling
methods. The reasons for these discrepancies are
uncertain, but suggest the need for a more system-
atic approach and increased training of health and
education
professionals
regarding
the
symptom
profile of language disorder in both sexes.
Study limitations
Our study uniquely measured functional impact in a
representative sample, reducing potential influence
of referral bias (Berkson’s bias) that is evident in
clinically referred samples. Nevertheless, our study is
limited by the exclusion of children with English as an
additional language (10.7% of the screened popula-
tion). There were 64 different languages represented
in the cohort and it was not possible to obtain
estimates of language ability in both English and the
child’s home language. Our population is also more
affluent than the national average, although we
sampled from across the social strata. Approximately
10% of school-aged pupils in Surrey are privately
educated and are not represented in our sample,
largely because such schools are not obliged to report
national curriculum assessments and thus we would
be unable to map functional impact of language
disorder for these children. It is unknown what pro-
portion of those children in private schools experience
language disorder. At the opposite end of the spec-
trum, we had fewer children from impoverished
neighbourhoods than the national average. Our find-
ings suggest a small, but significant association
between lower socioeconomic status and language
disorder, thus prevalence rates are likely to be higher
in areas of the country with increased socioeconomic
disadvantage. Although we had direct measures of
language and NVIQ, our measures of social, emo-
tional and behavioural problems and educational
attainment relied exclusively on teacher report. Direct
observation in combination with parental report of
functional impact would provide a more holistic view
of the child’s strengths and clinical needs. We
obtained information about referral to speech-lan-
guage therapy, but it was not possible to obtain
accurate information about ongoing involvement of
specialist clinicians. Finally, we were only able to
directly assess language ability and functional impact
at one point in time, while some authorities have
advocated assessment at two points for reliable
identification (Reilly, Tomblin, et al., 2014). We note
that this recommendation refers primarily to pre-
school children and that stability of language disorder
is greater after school entry (Tomblin et al., 2003).
Conclusions
Current DSM-5 criteria for language disorder does not
require a minimum level of nonverbal cognitive ability
and yields a prevalence estimate that is at least seven
times
higher
than
the
ICD-10
estimate,
which
requires both NVIQ within the normal range and
significant discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal
ability. Importantly, our diagnostic criteria identify
children for whom the majority experience functional
impact on learning in the first year of formal schooling.
We found minimal differences in the language and
clinical profiles of those with average versus low-
average NVIQ, supporting the decision to remove
NVIQ, and particularly the discrepancy between ver-
bal and nonverbal abilities, as exclusion criteria for
developmental language disorder in DSM-5. Notably,
children who experience language impairment as part
of a known medical condition and/or intellectual
disorder tend to have more severe language disorders
and more pervasive developmental concerns. Never-
theless, these children would also likely benefit from
specialist clinical input in order to maximize commu-
nication and learning. It is now imperative that
children with varying nonverbal cognitive profiles
are included in intervention trials to provide much
needed evidence concerning response to treatment at
different levels of NVIQ. This study also emphasizes
the need to raise awareness among education and
health services regarding language disorder and its
functional impact on children’s daily lives.

Key points
• Language disorder is a common cause of referral to health services in childhood and significantly increases risk
for long-term learning, social, emotional and behavioural problems.
• NVIQ is frequently used as an exclusion criteria, preventing children from accessing specialist clinical services.
• We report the first population prevalence estimates and associated functional impacts of language disorder
using DSM-5 criteria.
• At school entry, 7.58% of children have clinically significant language disorder of unknown cause associated
with increased rates of social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, and academic underachievement.
• The profile and severity of language disorder and associated functional impacts are similar in children with
average and below average NVIQ scores.
• Access to specialist clinical and educational services (i.e. speech-language therapy) should not depend on level
of NVIQ.
