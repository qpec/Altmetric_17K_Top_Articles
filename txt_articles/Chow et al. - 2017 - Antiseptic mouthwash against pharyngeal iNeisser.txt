ABSTRACT
Background Gonorrhoea is increasing among men
who have sex with men (MSM). We aimed to determine
whether Listerine, a commercial mouthwash product, has
an inhibitory effect against Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a
randomised controlled trial (RCT) and an in vitro study,
and therefore may be a potentially useful agent for
gonorrhoea control.
Methods In vitro: a suspension of ∼108 colony
forming units per mL (CFU/mL) of N. gonorrhoeae was
added to a serial of dilutions (up to 1:32) of alcohol-
containing Listerine mouthwashes (Cool Mint and Total
Care) for 1 min. A 10 mL aliquot was spread over the
surface of a gonococcal agar plate and the number of
N. gonorrhoeae colonies present at each dilution was
calculated. The phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was
used as a control. RCT: we recruited MSM with
pharyngeal gonorrhoea who returned for treatment at
the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre between May 2015
and February 2016. Untreated men were randomised to
rinse and gargle either Listerine Cool Mint or saline for
1 min. Pharyngeal swabs were taken before and after
rinsing and gargling for culture of N. gonorrhoeae. The
analysis included only men who were culture positive for
N. gonorrhoeae before using the allocated solution on
the day of recruitment.
Results In vitro: Listerine mouthwashes at dilutions of
up to 1:4 for 1 min resulted in significant reduction of
total N. gonorrhoeae counts but PBS has no inhibitory
effect against N. gonorrhoeae. RCT: a total of 196 MSM
were recruited, 58 (30%) were culture positive before
using the solution. After gargling the allocated solution,
men in the Listerine group were significantly less likely to
be culture positive on the pharyngeal surface (52%)
compared with men in the saline group (84%)
(p=0.013).
Conclusions This data suggest Listerine, significantly
reduces the amount of N. gonorrhoeae on the
pharyngeal surface. With daily use it may increase
gonococcal clearance and have important implications
for prevention strategies.
Trial registration number ACTRN12615000716561.
INTRODUCTION
Gonorrhoea cases among men who have sex with
men (MSM) are increasing in many countries. In
Australia, annual gonorrhoea diagnoses among men
have doubled from 6892 to 11 508 over the last
5 years, and about 70% of cases are in MSM.1
These increases are occurring in the context of
control programmes that have focused on screening
and condom use. The implementation and scale up
of biomedical interventions for HIV such as pre-
exposure prophylaxis and ‘Treatment as Prevention’
has been associated with an increase in the number
of sex partners and a decrease in condom use sug-
gesting cases of gonorrhoea will continue to rise.2–4
Rising rates of gonorrhoea will also increase the
risk of emergence of resistant gonorrhoea.5
6 A
gonorrhoea control measure that does not rely on
condom use is urgently needed.
Listerine is a commercial brand of mouthwash
which is commonly used and available from super-
markets or chemists worldwide. The manufacturer
claimed in 1879 that Listerine could be used to
cure gonorrhoea in the preantibiotic era7; however,
there have been no published scientific studies to
assess this. The aim of these two studies was to
examine first whether Listerine could be used to
inhibit the growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in an in
vitro study and then second to assess this in a ran-
domised controlled trial (RCT). If Listerine has an
inhibitory effect against N. gonorrhoeae in the
pharynx, it could be a cheap, easy to use and
potentially effective intervention for gonorrhoea
prevention and control in MSM.
METHODS
This paper describes two studies; an in vitro pilot
experiment to determine the inhibitory effect of
Listerine products against N. gonorrhoeae in the
laboratory environment and a randomised control
trial.
In vitro experiment: pilot study
W
e
chose
to
evaluate
two
alcohol-containing
Listerine products (Cool Mint and Total Care;
21.6%
alcohol)
because we
hypothesised
they
would be most likely to have an inhibitory effect
against N. gonorrhoeae. A standard suspension of
∼108 colony forming units per mL (CFU/mL) of a
wild-type clinical pharyngeal isolate of N. gonor-
rhoeae was added to a series of dilutions of 1:2 to
1:32 of both mouthwashes. Phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) was used as a control. After 1 min
exposure, a 10 mL aliquot was removed and spread
over the surface of a gonococcal (GC) agar plate

 (Media Preparation Unit, University of Melbourne) which was
incubated at 35°C with 5% CO2 for 48 hours. The number of
N. gonorrhoeae colonies present on GC agar at each dilution for
each mouthwash and saline control was recorded and the corre-
sponding CFU/mL calculated using standard methods (limit of
detection 102 CFU/mL).8 Each experiment was replicated three
times, and the results presented represent the mean of these
three replicates.
Randomised controlled trial
Trial design and participants
The GONE (GONorrhoea Eradication) study was a parallel, open-
labelled RCT conducted at Melbourne Sexual Health Centre
(MSHC) between 22 May 2015 and 2 February 2016. This trial is
registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical T
rials
network (ANZCTR), number ACTRN12615000716561 and is
reported in accordance with the CONSORT (CONsolidated
Standards of Reporting T
rials) 2010 guidelines.9 Ethical approval
was obtained from the Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee (number
544/14).
MSHC is the major publicly funded sexual health service in
Victoria, Australia, providing about 40 000 clinical consultations
annually, and about 37% of the consultations are MSM.10
MSHC provides free clinical consultations including HIV/STI
screening and treatment in accordance with the Australian STI
screening guidelines. As part of routine STI screening, MSM
who attended MSHC were screened for pharyngeal gonorrhoea
by the Gen-Probe Aptimo Combo 2 nucleic acid amplification
test (NAAT), and those who tested positive for pharyngeal gon-
orrhoea by NAAT were contacted and asked to return for anti-
biotic
treatment.
The
standard
antibiotic
treatment
for
gonorrhoea was ceftriaxone 500 mg as a single intramuscular
injection and azithromycin 1 g as a single dose.
MSM returning MSHC for treatment were offered the oppor-
tunity to participate in the study if they were eligible. Eligibility
criteria included: (1) men who reported any sexual contact with
another man in the last 12 months; (2) aged 16 years or above
and (3) tested positive for pharyngeal gonorrhoea by NAAT on
the day of screening and returned for standard antibiotic treat-
ment within 14 days. Men with symptomatic urethral gonor-
rhoea or those reporting contact with gonorrhoea were treated
on the day of screening and were not eligible for this trial.
Randomisation and masking
The randomisation sequence was generated with Stata (V
.13.1,
Stata, College Station, T
exas, USA) by an independent biostatisti-
cian. In the first month of the trial, participants were rando-
mised in a 1:4 ratio with a randomised block size of 10 to
receive saline (0.9% sodium chloride) or Listerine Cool Mint to
encourage recruitment. However, after starting the trial we
noted a low rate of culture positivity for pharyngeal gonorrhoea
among men randomised into the study which meant that with a
1:4 randomisation ratio, the trial would require a larger number
of participants than initially estimated. This together with feed-
back from participants that entry into the trial was not influ-
enced
by
the
probability
of
receiving
Listerine
made
us
reconsidered our randomisation ratio. W
e therefore changed to
a 1:1 ratio with a randomised block size of 10 to receive saline
or Listerine Cool Mint for the remaining 8 months of the trial.
Procedure
Figure 1A illustrates the study procedure of the RCT
. After
informed consent was obtained by experienced sexual health
clinicians,
a
sequentially
sealed
and
numbered
envelope
containing the study group allocation was opened. For both
groups, two pharyngeal swabs from the participants were taken,
one from the tonsillar fossae and one from the posterior orophar-
ynx. Participants were instructed to use 20 mL of the allocated
solution (ie, either Listerine Cool Mint or saline) by rinsing the
oral cavity and gargling back to the oropharynx for 1 min. Five
minutes after rinsing and gargling the solution, pharyngeal swabs
were repeated from the tonsillar fossae and the posterior oro-
pharynx in both groups. All pharyngeal swabs were plated onto
GC agar at the point of collection for culture of N. gonorrhoeae.
All participants were required to complete a questionnaire about
the use of mouthwash, alcohol drinking habits and sexual history
in the last 3 months. They received standard antibiotic treatment
for gonorrhoea after completing the gargle, questionnaires and
specimens collection and no follow-up was required.
Sample size
W
e assume alcohol-containing mouthwash would have a moder-
ate effect and reduce the proportion of men who have a positive
pharyngeal culture by 50% (from 80% to 40%). W
e did not use
100% in the control group because of the limited sensitivity of
pharyngeal swabs. With these estimates we would need about
30 individuals in each arm or about 60 culture positive indivi-
duals in total at 80% power with a two-side significance level of
α=0.05.
Statistical methods
Of 196 men recruited in the study, only 58 men who were
culture positive for N. gonorrhoeae before using the solution
(Listerine Cool Mint or saline) were included in the data ana-
lysis (specified a priori in the ANZCTR) (figure 1B). This was
because the effect of Listerine or saline could not be assessed on
men who were culture negative for N. gonorrhoeae on the day
of recruitment. T
wo-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to
compare the detection of N. gonorrhoeae between the Listerine
and saline groups (1) on the pharyngeal surface (posterior oro-
pharynx and/or tonsillar fossae); (2) at the tonsillar fossae and
(3) at the posterior oropharynx. Other potential confounding
factors such as age, frequency of mouthwash use, use of spirits
and HIV serostatus were also compared between two groups.
All analyses were performed using Stata (V
.13.1, Stata, College
Station, T
exas, USA).
RESULTS
In vitro study
Using a 1-minute exposure, and three biological replicates, both
Listerine Total Care and Cool Mint were found to significantly
inhibit the growth of the tested strain of N. gonorrhoeae at dilu-
tions of 1:2 and 1:4, even with the high inoculum of 108 CFU
(table 1). The PBS control displayed no inhibitory effect against
N. gonorrhoeae.
Randomised controlled trial
Characteristics of participants
A total of 213 men were eligible and 196 men were enrolled in
the study, 104 were randomised to use Listerine and 92 were
randomised to use saline (figure 1B). There was no significant
difference in age, number of partners, use of spirits or mouth-
wash, HIV serostatus or the proportion of pharyngeal gonor-
rhoea culture positive on the day between the two groups at
enrolment (see online supplementary table S1).
Of 196 men, 58 men were culture positive at either the pos-
terior oropharynx and/or tonsillar fossae before using the solu-
tion (28 men were positive at both posterior oropharynx and

 tonsillar fossae, 15 were positive at posterior oropharynx only
and another 15 were positive at tonsillar fossae only) (table 2).
The median age of the 58 men was 27 (IQR 24–31). The
median number of male sexual partners in last 3 months was 6
(IQR 3–8). Five (9%) men were HIV positive (four in the
Listerine group and one in the saline group). There was no sig-
nificant difference in age, number of partners, use of spirits or
mouthwash, HIV serostatus and days of return for treatment
between two groups (table 3).
Effect on the pharyngeal surface (posterior oropharynx and/or
tonsillar fossae)
Of the 58 men included in the final analysis, 33 men were in
the Listerine group and 25 men were in the saline group. Men
in the saline group had a significantly higher gonorrhoea culture
positivity on the pharyngeal surface (84%; 95% CI 64% to
95%), compared with men in the Listerine group (52%; 95%
CI 34% to 69%) after rinsing and gargling for 1 min (p=0.013,
Fisher’s exact test) (table 3). Men in the Listerine group had a
lower odds of being culture positive for gonorrhoea on the pha-
ryngeal surface (OR=0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.72) compared
with those in the saline group 5 min after 1-minute rinse and
gargle.
Effect at the tonsillar fossae
Forty-three men were culture positive at the tonsillar fossae
before using the solution (table 3). Men in the saline group had a
higher gonorrhoea culture positivity at the tonsillar fossae (90%;

Forty-three men were culture positive at the posterior orophar-

orrhoea culture positivity at the posterior oropharynx among
men in the saline group was 70% (95% CI 46% to 88%); while
the gonorrhoea culture positivity among men in the Listerine
group was 57% (95% CI 34% to 77%) after rinsing and garg-
ling the allocated solution for 1 min, but the difference of effect
was not statistically significant (p=0.277, Fisher’s exact test).
Men in the Listerine group had a lower odds of (OR=0.56;
95% CI 0.16 to 1.97) having a positive culture result at the pos-
terior oropharynx compared with those in the saline group,
though the difference was not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
The two studies presented here are the first to demonstrate
Listerine can inhibit the growth of N. gonorrhoeae in vitro and
in a clinical study and raise the potential that it may be useful as
a control measure. If daily use of mouthwash was shown to
reduce the duration of untreated infection and/or reduce the
probability of acquisition of N. gonorrhoeae then this readily
available, condomless and low-cost intervention may have very
significant public health implications in the control of gonor-
rhoea in MSM. Interventions such as this are urgently needed in
the context of rising rates of gonorrhoea in MSM11 and the
likelihood that condom use may fall further as condom-free
HIV preventions are more widely adopted.2 3
The main limitation of our study is the short follow-up time
after mouthwash use. W
e did this because we considered more
evidence was required before undertaking either a prevention
study
involving
daily
use
(ACTRN12616000247471)
over
months or a large comparative treatment study. Both required
convincing preliminary clinical data showing efficacy in reducing
culture positivity for N. gonorrhoeae. The short follow-up
period means we cannot exclude the mouthwash having only a
short lived effect. However, the laboratory evidence showing a
strong inhibitory effect compared with saline would suggest a
longer effect. In addition, if the load of N. gonorrhoeae was
reduced by the mouthwash after a single dose then one might
expect that daily mouthwash over weeks would potentially
reduce the viable number of N. gonorrhoeae, and hence reduce
further transmission or reduce the mean duration of infection.

 This study has several limitations that should be noted. First,
this trial was not blinded to the research team or the partici-
pants. This could have led to a possible unconscious variation in
the way the clinicians obtained pharyngeal specimens although
they were not aware of the results of the in vitro laboratory
study until after the trial was completed. The observation that
there was no difference in the proportion of baseline swabs
positive by culture in both groups and that the effect of mouth-
wash was limited only to the tonsillar fossae and not posterior
oropharyngeal samples would argue against a systematic bias
from sampling. Second, although 196 men were enrolled in the
study, only 58 (30%) men with a culture positive for pharyngeal
gonorrhoea on the day of treatment were included in the ana-
lysis to assess the effectiveness of mouthwash. W
e included only
culture positive men in the analysis because we could not assess
the endpoint if baseline cultures were negative. Low proportion
of culture positive may due to self-limited colonisation within
days.12 13 Third, while the in vitro laboratory study demon-
strated consistent inhibition of N. gonorrhoeae at dilutions of
1:2 and 1:4, to date we have only used a single wild-type clin-
ical isolate of N. gonorrhoeae and further testing against add-
itional
clinical
and
reference
isolates
may
be
valuable.
Nonetheless, the results of the clinical study support the findings
of the in vitro study which involved many different isolates, and
further suggest that the inhibition demonstrated with a single
high inoculum experiment in the laboratory is clinically relevant
and important. Finally, we had a relatively small sample size that
was able to identify only a moderate effect size of Listerine.
W
e did this because it was the first study of its type and even
when the study was powered for a moderate effect size we
required over 200 NAAT positive cases. To assess an OR of
about 0.5 would require about 200 culture positive cases in
each group or nearly 600 positive pharyngeal gonorrhoea cases
by NAATwhich would be a much more substantial undertaking.
If future studies are specifically interested in assessing the effect
of mouthwash on the positivity of the posterior oropharynx
(OR 0.56) alone they will require a substantially larger study
than ours.
W
e found that the significant effect of the mouthwash was
limited to the tonsillar fossae (OR 0.14) and that the effect was
less marked at the posterior oropharynx (OR 0.56). Our study
was designed to detect an effect size of six or more and so was
not powered to detect an OR of 0.56 at the posterior orophar-
ynx. The evidence from our RCT suggests it will be effective
but it may be that more mouthwash reaches the tonsillar fossae
than the posterior oropharynx during use and highlight the
need to gargle and not just rinse. The different effect by site
does raise the issue of whether mouthwash use will translate to
a reduction in gonorrhoea carriage or prevent infection. To
address this question we are currently recruiting for a study to
determine if daily use of Listerine over months will reduce the
risk of reinfection and are sampling men at both the tonsillar
fossae and posterior oropharynx (ACTRN12616000247471).
There are some other characteristics of Listerine that suggest it
could become an effective intervention if it were shown to be
acceptable and effective. First, mouthwash in general is com-
monly available in supermarkets and most people use it, although
only a minority (∼20%) use it every day. A recent study has
shown that of the 10 men were asked to use Listerine at least
once every day, they used it 95% of days over a 2-week period.14
Furthermore, another MSM study in San Francisco has shown
that the majority of men (>90%) reporting it was easy to gargle a
mouthwash.15 However, information on how mouthwash is used
at a population and its’ acceptability are required.
Whether a pharyngeal intervention can reduce the overall
rates of gonorrhoea when it also infects the anus and urethra,
depends on the contribution that pharyngeal gonorrhoea makes
to the overall incidence in MSM. While theoretically gonor-
rhoea at asymptomatic sites has a greater opportunity to be
transmitted than short lived urethral infection, this has not yet
been determined. Urethral infection in any individual is mostly
symptomatic and in most settings infected individuals rapidly
seek healthcare.16 There is only one published model of gonor-
rhoea in MSM and this suggested pharyngeal transmission was
important in the persistence at a population level.17
A number of studies have implicated pharyngeal gonorrhoea
as an important source of both urethral and anal infection.18 19
A cross-sectional study has shown 34% of MSM with urethral
gonorrhoea had no insertive anal sex or no unprotected inser-
tive anal sex in the previous 3 months, suggests penile-anal sex
may not be the only driver for gonorrhoea.20 Very similar
results were reported from a case–control study from Seattle
where 34% of urethral gonorrhoea was attributable to oral
sex.21 These data are supported by a mathematical model
showing gonorrhoea in MSM cannot be eliminated even with
100% of condom use for penile-anal sex.17
Our data provide preliminary evidence to support the further
investigation of mouthwash as a non-condom based control
measure for gonorrhoea. Listerine mouthwash is a cheap, easy
to use and effective agent that inhibits gonorrhoea growth and
requires further careful consideration and study.
Key messages
▸ Dilutions of up to 1:4 resulted in significant declines in total
Neisseria gonorrhoeae counts.
▸ After rinsing and gargling men in the Listerine group were
significantly less likely to be culture positive on the
pharyngeal surface.
▸ Listerine significantly reduces the amount of N. gonorrhoeae
on the pharyngeal surface and therefore may be a
potentially useful for gonorrhoea control.

contributed to the conception and design of the randomisation controlled trial.
EPFC, BPH, GF and CKF contributed to the design of the in vitro laboratory study.
EPFC, SW and DL involved in data management of the randomisation controlled
trial. BPH involved in the laboratory testing, data analysis and interpretation of the
in vitro laboratory study. EPFC involved in data analysis and interpretation of the
randomisation controlled trial. CKF, MYC and CSB assisted with the data
interpretation of the randomisation controlled trial. DL, AS and SC involved in study
recruitment and acquisition of data. BPH provided the overall supervision of the in
vitro laboratory study, and CKF provided the overall supervision of the randomisation
controlled trial. EPFC wrote the first draft of the manuscript. All authors involved in
revising the manuscript critically for important intellectual content and approved the
final version.
