IMPORTANCE Little is known about the long-term yield of high-grade cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (CIN) and the influence on biopsy and treatment rates of human papillomavirus
(HPV) triage of cytology showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
(hereafter ASC-US cytology).
OBJECTIVE To examine 5-year outcomes after ASC-US cytology with vs without HPV testing.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this observational study, all cervical cytology and
HPV testing reports from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012, were obtained for women
throughout New Mexico and linked to pathology reports. The dates of the analysis were May
4, 2015, to January 13, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Influence of HPV testing on disease yield, time to
histologically confirmed disease, and biopsy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure rates.
RESULTS A total of 457 317 women (mean [SD] age, 39.8 [12.5] years) with a screening test
were recorded between 2008 and 2012, and 20 677 (4.5%) of the first cytology results per
woman were reported as ASC-US. CIN grade 3 or more severe (CIN3+) lesions were detected
in 2.49% of women with HPV testing vs 2.15% of women without HPV testing (P = .23). Time
to CIN3+ detection was much shorter in those with HPV testing vs those without testing
(median, 103 vs 393 days; P < .001). CIN grade 1 was detected in 11.6% of women with HPV
testing vs 6.6% without testing (relative risk, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.56-2.00; P < .001). Loop
electrosurgical excision procedure rates within 5 years were 20.0% higher in those who
underwent HPV testing, resulting in more CIN2+ and CIN3+ detection.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Human papillomavirus testing led to faster and more
complete diagnosis of cervical disease, but 55.8% more biopsies and 20.0% more loop
electrosurgical excision procedures were performed. In those tested, virtually all high-grade
disease occurred in the 43.1% of women who were HPV positive, allowing clinical resources
to be focused on women who need them most. These data provide essential information for
cervical screening guidelines and public health policy.

here has been much interest in the use of human pap-
illomavirus (HPV) testing to guide the management of
women with low-grade cervical cytology test results.
Manycountries,includingtheUnitedStates,recommendedre-
flexHPVtestingaftercytologyshowingatypicalsquamouscells
ofundeterminedsignificance(hereafterASC-UScytology).The
American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology rec-
ommended reflex HPV testing for ASC-US cytology in women
25 years and older and repeat cytology for those aged 21 to 24
years.1 Immediate HPV reflex testing or 12-month repeat cy-
tology was considered acceptable for both age groups. Al-
thoughwidelyusedforseveralyearsintheUnitedStates,where

sult for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more se-

the longer-term influence of routine HPV triage on disease de-
tection and clinical management.
Recently, our group documented the use of HPV testing
in New Mexico and its influence on subsequent biopsies and
repeat cytology and HPV tests.3 Briefly, that study found that
HPV testing was used for approximately 80% of women aged
30 to 64 years with ASC-US cytology. In contrast, the use of
HPV co-testing was still below 20% among women aged 30 to
64 years in 2012 but has recently been rapidly increasing. Hu-
man papillomavirus positivity in ASC-US was strongly age de-
pendent, ranging from 72% at age 15 to 20 years to 22% at age
50 to 64 years.
Herein, we extend that work by examining the influence
of HPV testing for women with ASC-US cytology on the detec-
tion of CIN2+ and CIN3+ in the 5 years after HPV testing. The
following issues are addressed: (1) the influence of HPV triage
on the 5-year rate of high-grade lesions, (2) how HPV testing
affects the interval between an ASC-US screening cytology and
the detection of histologically confirmed high-grade CIN, and
(3) the extent to which HPV leads to overdetection and over-
treatment of low-grade lesions destined to regress during the
subsequent 5-year period.
Methods
Study Design
The focus of this study was the histologic CIN outcome after
an ASC-US cytology screening result during 2008 to 2012
among women aged 21 to 64 years. A screening cytology was
defined as a cytology test that was not preceded by another
cytology test within 300 days. The New Mexico HPV Pap Reg-
istry obtained statewide cervical cytology and HPV testing rec-
ordsfrom9laboratoriesinNewMexicoand9out-of-statelabo-
ratories between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012.
Pathology records for biopsy outcomes were obtained for an
additional year (through December 31, 2013) to enable a mini-
mum follow-up of 1 year. The dates of the analysis were May
4, 2015, to January 13, 2017. Tests were linked to women using
probabilistic matching4 and augmented with manual re-
views when linkage was uncertain.5 Screening intervals have
increased over time and have been detailed previously.5 Any
HPV test for high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52,
56, 58, 59, and 68) within 28 days of a screening cytology test
was used to assign HPV test status (positive, negative, or not
performed). This test could have been a co-test with cytology
aspartofprimaryscreeningorareflextestasaresultofASC-US
cytology.AlmostallHPVtesting(95.3%)through2012wasper-
formedwithamodularsystem(HybridCapture2;Qiagen).His-
tology results from cervical and endocervical specimens were
used to assess the incidence of CIN1, CIN2, and CIN3 after
screening. Ongoing evaluations of cervical screening (cytol-
ogy and HPV testing), diagnosis, and treatment by the New
Mexico HPV Pap Registry have been reviewed and approved
under exempt status by the University of New Mexico Hu-
man Research Review Committee.
Statistical Analysis
Time from the first screening ASC-US cytology to histologi-
cally confirmed disease was assessed using (1 minus) Kaplan-
Meier methods to obtain cumulative incidence curves and in-
cidence rate estimates (with 95% CIs) at 1, 3, and 5 years for
CIN1, CIN1+, CIN2, CIN2+, and CIN3+ by age and HPV test sta-
tus (all, HPV tested, HPV not tested, HPV positive, and HPV
negative). If more than 1 lesion was detected within 6 months
of the initial histologic finding, only the highest-grade lesion
was counted, but the date of the first biopsy was used to de-
termine the interval from the first ASC-US screening cytol-
ogy, whereas if a subsequent higher-grade lesion was found
after6months,bothwerecounted.CIN1+andCIN2+werecom-
puted to allow estimates of CIN1 and CIN2 alone without sub-
sequent higher-grade lesions (eg, CIN1 alone is the difference
between CIN1+ and CIN2+ and similarly for CIN2 alone). Dif-
ferences between subgroups (eg, HPV tested vs not tested or
HPV positive vs negative) were based on relative risks (RRs)
calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates at years 1 and 5. The
95% CIs and significance levels for RRs were calculated using
the delta method and a normal approximation for the log-
transformed RR via a software program (R package “epit-
ools”; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Follow-up for
CIN1 was censored after the detection of CIN2+, and fol-
low-upforCIN2wascensoredafterthedetectionofCIN3+.Fol-
low-up was also censored after a loop electrosurgical exci-
sion procedure (LEEP) or hysterectomy (but not biopsy) and
Key Points
Question What are the long-term benefits and harms of human
papillomavirus (HPV) testing among women with cytology
showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance?
Findings In this study after an abnormal screening cytology,
16.0% more cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or more
severe (CIN3+) lesions were detected in women with HPV testing,
and time to CIN3+ detection was much shorter. Biopsy rates were
55% higher, and loop electrosurgical excision procedure rates
were 20% higher in those who underwent HPV testing, leading to
higher CIN2+ and CIN3+ detection rates.
Meaning Human papillomavirus testing after abnormal cytology
results in earlier and more complete detection of high-grade CIN
lesions but at the expense of more biopsies and loop
electrosurgical excision procedures.

Results
Atotalof457 317women(mean[SD]age,39.8[12.5]years)with
a screening test were recorded between 2008 and 2012, and
20 677 (4.5%) of the first cytology results per woman were re-
ported as ASC-US. For women with ASC-US, the median time
from the prior screening test was 28.3 months and was similar
acrossagegroups.Themedianpotentialfollow-uptimeafteran

cytologyhadaco-test,3indicatingthattheremaining64.9%over-
all (or 80.6% of those tested) had HPV for triage of their ASC-US
cytology. Although co-testing increased from 5.2% in 2007 to
19.1% in 2012 of all screens,3 no difference in HPV use for
ASC-US was seen across this period (range, 77.2%-82.5%; P for
trend = .70).Itwasnotpossibletodistinguishbetweenco-testing
andtriagetestsonanindividuallevel.Also,nodifferencesbyage
groupwereseen(range,79.1%-81.9%;Pfortrend = .50).Ofthose
that had an HPV test, 7179 (43.1%) were positive. Human papil-
lomavirus positivity and high-grade histologic findings were
strongly and inversely age dependent (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). Of those with an ASC-US screening result, within the
follow-up period, no abnormal histology was found in 17 551
(84.1%[5-yearKaplan-Meierestimate]),CIN1withoutsubsequent
CIN2+wasfoundin1969(9.9%),CIN2withoutsubsequentCIN3+
was found in 705 (3.6%), and CIN3+ was found in 452 (2.4%)
(Table 1). Further details by age, HPV status, and Kaplan-Meier
estimates at 1, 3, and 5 years are listed in Table 1 and eTable 1 in
the Supplement.
High-grade Lesions
The 5-year estimated cumulative rate of CIN3 or more
severe lesions (adenocarcinoma in situ or cancer) was 2.4%
in women with ASC-US screening cytology (in 2.5% of
women with HPV testing vs 2.2% of women without HPV
testing), indicating that HPV testing led to a 15.8% overall
increase in the detection of CIN3+ (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.92-
1.45; P = .23). Earlier detection was apparent when HPV
testing was used (Table 1 and Figure), with a median time of
103 vs 393 days (P < .001), and was especially apparent in
the first year of follow-up (Table 1, Table 2, and Figure),
where the difference was 1.49% vs 0.93% (absolute differ-
ence, 0.56%) (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.14-2.25; P = .004). How-
ever, the absolute and relative differences were smaller by
year 5 (absolute difference, 0.34%) (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.92-
1.45; P = .23). Therefore, most CIN3+ lesions are persistent
and are eventually detected even without HPV triage.
As with CIN3+, time to diagnosis of CIN2 was much shorter
inwomenwhohadanHPVtest(median,91daysinthosetested
vs 340 days in those not tested; P < .001) (Table 1 and Figure).
In particular, the rate after 1 year was 3.0% in those with HPV
testing vs 1.6% in those without HPV testing (RR, 1.82; 95% CI,
1.41-2.35;P < .001).Themajordifferencewasseenwithin1year
(6.87%vs0.05%)(absolutedifference,6.82%)(RR,128.52;95%

ferencecontinuedtodivergeforthewhole5-yearperiod(9.39%
vs 0.52%) (absolute difference, 7.87%) (eTable 1 and eFigure 1
in the Supplement).
Slightly larger differences in 5-year detection rates were
seen when the analysis was restricted to CIN2, where a 27.3%
increase (4.3% of women with HPV testing vs 3.4% of women
without HPV testing) in detection was seen in those tested (RR,
1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.53; P = .008) (Tables 1 and 2, Figure, and
eFigure 2 in the Supplement), which led to a relative increase
of 21.8% (6.3% of women with HPV testing vs 5.1% of women
without HPV testing) for the detection of CIN2+ (RR, 1.22; 95%
CI, 1.05-1.41; P = .007) (Table 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supple-
ment). The detection of CIN3+ and CIN2+ after an ASC-US
screeningcytologywasclearlyagedependent,withlowerrates
observedatolderagesbothoverallandinHPV-positivewomen
(eTable 1, eFigure 3, and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Differ-
ences were also observed between women aged 21 to 24 years
and those aged 25 to 29 years (eFigure 5 and eFigure 6 in the
Supplement).
Among women with HPV testing, the cases of CIN2 and
CIN3+ disease diagnosed within 5 years were almost exclu-
sively in HPV-positive women. The RRs were always above 10
except for CIN3+ in women aged 50 to 64 years, where it was
7.64 (eTable 2 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
CIN1
CIN1 was detected within the subsequent 5 years in 11.6% of
womenwithHPVtestingand6.6%ofwomenwithoutHPVtest-
ing,leadingtoa76.2%increaseinCIN1detection(RR,1.76;95%
CI, 1.56-2.00; P < .001) (Figure, Tables 1 and 2, and eFigure 1
in the Supplement). As summarized in Table 2, the increase
was similar across age groups (P = .32). In those tested for HPV,
CIN1 was much more common in women who were HPV posi-
tive (24.3% vs 2.7% after 5 years) (RR, 9.11; 95% CI, 8.01-
10.36; P < .001) and was detected earlier (19.8% vs 0.8% after
1 year) (RR, 23.52; 95% CI, 18.81-29.41; P < .001), with a me-
dian time to detection of 61 vs 582 days (P < .001). The rela-
tive difference between HPV positive vs negative after 5 years
was slightly smaller in women aged 21 to 29 years (RR, 6.54;
95% CI, 5.31-8.04; P < .001) but increased with age, and a test
for trend was statistically significant (P = .002) (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
LEEP and Biopsy Rates
Five-year LEEP rates ranged from 76.6% for CIN3+ to 10.2%
for CIN1 (Table 3). Five-year LEEP rates for CIN1 and CIN2 were
lower in those who had HPV testing and similar for CIN3+, but
the overall rate after 5 years was 20.0% higher in those who
had HPV testing (4.9% of women with HPV testing vs 4.0% of
womenwithoutHPVtesting,P = .03)becausemorediseasewas
found. Women who only had CIN1 that was not followed by a
higher-grade lesion had lower 5-year LEEP rates than all CIN1
(6.8% vs 10.2%), which was not statistically significantly dif-

 ferent across HPV groups. Women who were HPV tested had
a higher LEEP rate in year 1 (2.9% of women with HPV testing
vs 1.5% of women without HPV testing, P < .001) but had
slightly lower rates in years 2 through 5 (1.9% of women with
HPV testing vs 2.6% of women without HPV testing, P = .01).
The difference was primarily due to the higher initial CIN1 rate
in those tested for HPV (Table 1). Much of this increase fol-
lowed subsequent higher-grade repeat cytology (ie, 6.5%
ASC-US only, 9.2% low-grade squamous intraepithelial le-
sions, 15.7% atypical squamous cells [cannot exclude high-
grade squamous intraepithelial lesions], and 37.4% high-
grade squamous intraepithelial lesions). LEEP rates in women
with CIN1 only over 5 years were not statistically significantly
lower in those who were HPV tested vs those who were not
tested (6.7% vs 7.6%, P = .70), and most of these cases were
in women with more than 1 CIN1 biopsy. The ratio of LEEPs to
CIN3+ lesions detected after 5 years was similar and not sta-
tistically different between the 2 groups (1.95 for those tested
vs 1.88 for those not tested) (Tables 1 and 3). LEEP rates were
lower for each histologic grade of disease in younger women
compared with older women but were higher overall (5-year
estimated rate, 5.7% in women aged 21-29 years vs 4.0% in
women aged 30-64 years) due to more disease in younger
women (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The proportion of women with 1 or more procedures, in-
cludingabiopsyoranendocervicalcurettage(excludingLEEP),
was also higher for those with HPV testing. The estimated pro-
portion with 1 or more biopsies in the subsequent 5 years was
32.1% vs 20.6% (P < .001) for those without testing (a 55.8%
increase) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Of women with HPV
testing, the estimated biopsy proportions were 59.7% among
those who were HPV positive vs 11.2% among those who were

a The number of cases of CIN1+ can be less than CIN1 plus CIN2+ because
women who are diagnosed as having CIN1 and then CIN2+ more than 6
months later are counted twice; similarly, the number of cases of CIN2+ can be
less than CIN2 plus CIN3+ because women who are diagnosed as having CIN2
and then CIN3+ more than 6 months later are counted twice. Subtraction of
CIN2+ proportions from CIN1+ proportions gives the proportion with CIN1 and

 HPV negative (P < .001). These rates were similar across age
groups except for lower rates in those aged 50 to 64 years.
The extent to which differences in outcomes were
related to more follow-up and biopsies in women with HPV
testing is summarized in eTable 5 in the Supplement. Of
those with HPV testing, an estimated 15.9% had no evidence
of any further follow-up after the initial ASC-US screening
cytology and HPV test compared with 21.1% of those without
HPV testing (P < .001) so that more disease was probably
undetected in those without HPV testing, and there was
little difference across age groups. Of women with HPV test-
ing, the follow-up rate was strongly influenced by the out-
come (10.6% with no follow-up after an HPV-positive result
vs 20.0% with no follow-up after an HPV-negative result,
P < .001). Because follow-up was more complete for the
HPV-tested group, especially for those who were HPV posi-
tive with complete follow-up, the true difference in 5-year
CIN3+ rates between those tested vs not tested could have
been smaller than the 0.34% observed. Therefore, HPV test-
ing leads not only to earlier disease detection but also to
more disease CIN3+ detection due at least in part to more
complete follow-up of HPV-positive women.
Discussion
This study is the first comprehensive evaluation to date of the
influence of HPV testing on the long-term outcome associ-
ated with ASC-US cytology. Such analyses are only possible
when a system is in place to monitor cervical screening using
bothcytologyandHPVtestingwithfollow-upofhistologicout-
comes. The New Mexico HPV Pap Registry is the sole state-
wide program capable of providing this information in the
United States. Such surveillance systems are essential if popu-
lation screening for cervical cancer, as well as other cancers
and diseases, is to fulfill its prophecy as a cost-effective ap-
proach to disease prevention.
It is clear from this study and elsewhere6,7 that almost all
of the high-grade disease in women with ASC-US cytology is
associated with HPV positivity and that HPV testing leads to
earlierdetectionandtreatmentofdisease.Overa5-yearfollow-
up, more CIN lesions of all grades are detected if HPV testing
is used. The increase was small for CIN3+ and not statistically
significant but was statistically significant for CIN2 and CIN1.
A higher sensitivity of HPV triage for CIN2+ has also been re-
ported in an overview8 but did not account for follow-up time.
For CIN1, there is clearly overdiagnosis of lesions destined to
regress, and extra repeat cytology, colposcopy, and biopsy oc-
curred in these women in the present study. However, these
procedures led to the detection of more high-grade disease,
and the ratio of LEEPs to CIN3+ lesions was not increased by
HPV testing. Among HPV-tested women, virtually all of these
procedures were in HPV-positive women (10.4% vs 0.7%).
Newer triage algorithms with greater specificity based on
the use of HPV genotype,9 methylation status,10,11 and p16
expression12 may help to minimize these procedures, which
isespeciallyimportantforyoungerwomenofchildbearingage.
An excess of CIN2 and a small increase in CIN3+ were also ob-
served in women with HPV testing, indicating that some high-
grade lesions are detected, which may also be likely to re-
gress with this approach. However, some of this excess in

 detection of high-grade disease may represent undetected dis-
ease due to the lower sensitivity of cytology without HPV tri-
age, and these women may still harbor as yet undiagnosed
precancerous and invasive lesions.
Limitations
Because the use of HPV testing was not randomized in this ob-
servational study, it is possible that women not tested had a
different risk of disease or their clinicians used different fol-
low-up strategies after ASC-US. Although we could not detect
any secular trend in the use of HPV triage or variation in the
age distribution of those tested, it is possible that there are so-
cioeconomic or other relevant differences in aspects of the
health care facilities that have not been measured herein. In
preliminary geospatial analyses, we have observed that clin-
ics located in rural areas (vs urban) are less likely to use HPV
testing, either as a co-test for all or as ASC-US triage. We also
found that, even in urban areas, public health clinics and some
federally qualified health centers had almost no HPV testing
beingperformedduringthestudyperiod,suggestingthatsome
women with lower socioeconomic status may not be offered
HPV testing, which is an area of ongoing study.
However, even if the lack of HPV triage is only a measur-
able marker for other factors determining detection rates and
time to diagnosis, it still provides useful information that can
help to improve the management of ASC-US cytology. Never-
theless, the main findings herein of a shorter time to disease
detection, a higher detection rate of high-grade and low-
grade lesions, and increased biopsy and LEEP rates in women
who are HPV tested appear to be robust.

 Conclusions
Approximately 3.5% of screen-detected cancers are from the
initialfollow-upofASC-UScytology.13Presently,wedonothave
data on the influence of HPV triage on this rate, but the simi-
lar5-yeardetectionratesforstatisticallysignificantlesionssug-
gest that the effect will be small. While a model-based cost-
effectiveness analysis has been conducted and suggested that
HPV triage is more effective and less costly than repeat cytol-
ogy or immediate colposcopy,14 a full economic evaluation of
the costs and benefits of HPV triage based on a large cohort is
desirable. The present study also highlights the enormous pre-
dictive value of HPV testing for women with ASC-US cytology
because virtually all high-grade disease occurred in the 43.1%
of women who were HPV positive, which allows colposcopy
and related resources to be focused on women who need them
most.
