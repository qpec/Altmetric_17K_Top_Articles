Alien hand syndrome (AHS) is a neurological illness characterized by limb movements
which are carried out without being aware of it. Many patients describe these
movements as aggressive and some perceive a strong feeling of estrangement and
go so far as to deny ownership. The sense of body ownership is the perception
that parts of one’s body pertain to oneself, despite it is moving or not and if
movement is intentional or unintentional. These anomalous self-experiences may arise
in patients with focal brain lesions and provide unique opportunities to disclose
the neural components underlying self-body perception. The feeling of foreignness
described in AHS is often observed in post-central cortical lesions in the non-dominant
hemisphere and is typical of the “posterior alien hand variant”. We used Diffusion-
Tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) in an unusual case of posterior AHS
of the dominant hand in a professional pianist with corticobasal syndrome (CBS).
The patient showed uncontrolled levitation with the right arm while playing the piano
and perceived as if her hand had a “mind of its own” which prevented her from
playing. MRI-scans show asymmetric brain atrophy, mainly involving left post-central
regions and SPECT-Tc99m-ECD patterns of hypometabolism over the left parietal-
occipital cortices. DT-MRI revealed extensive damage which comprised left fronto-
temporal cortex and extends into the ipsilateral parietal cortex causing a disruption
of corpus callosum (CC) projections from the rostrum to the splenium. Our case
illustrates that posterior AHS may occur in the dominant hemisphere due to widespread
damage, which exceed parietal cortex. The parietal lobe has been recognized as a
multimodal association region that gets input from several networks and organizes
motor output. We suggest that the disturbance to this pathway could result in disruption
of motor output and associate an abnormal motor control and anomalous self-body
perception.

Atypical AHS in a Pianist
INTRODUCTION
Alien hand syndrome (AHS) is one of the most gripping
disconnection disorders in neurology. It could be described as
the perception that one limb ‘‘has its own volition’’ together
with recognizable uncontrolled motor activity which pries with
the voluntary movements of the unaffected limb (Doody and
Jankovic, 1992). It is fairly common that the affected arm holds
clothes, parts of the body, adjacent objects or even people
(Josephs and Rossor, 2004). Moreover, patients are usually
unaware of it, and could display signs of inattention of the
affected limb, perceiving that it is not theirs (Josephs and Rossor,
2004).
AHS is observed in post-stroke patients, secondary to
vascular malformations and brain tumors, neurosurgical lesions,
trauma and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in atypical
parkinsonian
syndromes
as
corticobasal
syndrome
(CBS)
and progressive supranuclear palsy (Scepkowski and Cronin-
Golomb, 2003; Chang et al., 2012; Alexander et al., 2014).
The presence of limb apraxia, visuospatial dysfunction and
AHS is suggestive of CBS, particularly when it develops in
a progressive way. In fact, alien hand phenomenon appears
in around 30% of compiled CBS cases (Armstrong et al.,
2013). Neural mechanisms of AHS have remained speculative
and the combination of lesions necessary to produce this
phenomenon is uncertain (Scepkowski and Cronin-Golomb,
2003). According to the anatomical lesions and clinical features,
three different categories: callosal, frontal and posterior AHS
have been described. The first two types are classified as
an anterior form of AHS whereas the third one is also
defined as a posterior form (Scepkowski and Cronin-Golomb,
2003). The more common ‘‘anterior or motor’’ AHS is
characterized by uncontrollable manipulation of objects and
involuntary grasping of the dominant hand. Posterior subtype
(pAHS) is uncommon and usually associated with involuntary
movements such as a position-dependent levitation of the
arm in addition to a sensation of strangeness in the limb
(Scepkowski and Cronin-Golomb, 2003). The etiology of
involuntary movements in pAHS is not elucidated yet and
remains unclear (Armstrong et al., 2013). It mostly, though
not exclusively, affects the non-dominant hand with lesions
involving the posterior right hemisphere (Kessler and Hathout,
2009). Shared mechanisms between AHS variants have been
described and the data seem to indicate that most cases
of AHS arise from lesions of interhemispheric networks or
between the frontal and the parietal lobes (Sarva et al., 2014).
However, the case-report descriptions of patients with damage
distant from the typical affected areas reflects our partial
knowledge of the processes producing AHS (Sarva et al.,
2014).
We describe a case of pAHS of the dominant right
hand secondary to CBS in a 65-year-old professional pianist
with unusually increased alien limb symptoms while playing.
Diffusion-Tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) and
fiber tractography could offer the opportunity to shed light on
the pathophysiology of AHS and other neurological disorders
affecting the perception of one’s own body.
CASE REPORT
Patient History
A 65-year-old woman, right-handed professional pianist suffered
from increasing awkwardness of her dominant arm during the
last 5 years. She was healthy until the age of 60, when she first
felt impairment of the voluntary movement of her right hand
while playing the piano. She experienced as whether her arm
‘‘didn’t do what it was ought to’’ and declined to play due to
it was ‘‘too clumsy to practice’’. Rarely, when she moved her
left hand, the right one raised involuntarily. She felt strange
and surprise with the behavior of her affected arm and believed
that ‘‘it had an entity of its own’’. After 2 years, she had severe
difficulties with playing and, although her right hand was not
paretic, her movement was significantly slowed down. The hand
carried on its odd compartment, which utterly hampered her
from playing. No history of any other illnesses, toxins or drugs
were reported. The patient underwent a detailed assessment by
a neurology specialist. Its main features on clinical examination
were asymmetric hand clumsiness, rigidity and bradykinesia with
reduced right arm swing, prominent right constructional and
ideomotor apraxia and feelings of estrangement of the right
limb coupled with non-purposeful movements such as levitation,
especially when attention decreased well distinguishable from
distal pseudo-athetosis which was not presented. She exhibited
other cortical sensory deficits such as decreased pain sensation in
the right side besides transcortical motor aphasia. Clinical criteria
for dementia were absent.
The patient was diagnosed as having probable CBS based on
recently published criteria (Armstrong et al., 2013; Alexander
et al., 2014) furthermore, she displayed the typical features of
pAHS. She was treated with levodopa (until 800 mg per day) and
clonazepam (1 mg per day). However, she had modest response
to it.
Methods
As part of the clinical assessment, MRI was performed in
a 3T MR scanner (Philips Achieva, Philips Medical Systems,
Nederlands) with a SENSE Neurovascular coil (16 elements). No
contrast agent or sedation was utilized. For the MRI protocol
a high-resolution T1-weighted gradient-echo scan: 212 slices,
0.8 mm isotropic voxels, FOV 250 × 250 mm, TR 11 ms and
TE 4.9 ms was acquired. DT Imaging (DTI) was acquired in
axial slice orientation, using a single-shot EPI sequence with
diffusion encoding in 32 directions (values 0 and 800 s/mm2,
voxel size was 2 × 2 × 2 mm3, 60 slices, SENSE factor 1.9).
The diffusion-weighted data were transferred to a workstation
for analysis and eddy current compensation was performed by
affine registration to B0 image. Tractography was carried out
using the PRIDE fiber-tracking tool (Philips Medical Systems) as
described previously (Alfaro et al., 2015; Bernabeu et al., 2016)
and was fulfilled based on the connection between two areas
of regions of interest (ROIs), the ROIs were drawn manually
based on the anatomical MRI and on published atlases (Wakana
et al., 2004). The fibers were computed automatically by the
software with the following parameters as stopping criteria:
minimum fractional anisotropy value (FA) of 0.3, maximum

Additionally,

with
SPECT-
Tc99m-ECD were performed with a Philips Forte Gamma
Camera System (Philips Medical Systems, US) using Tc-99m
radiopharmaceuticals. Imaging acquisition and reconstruction
was carried out with the usual specified protocols (Delrieu et al.,
2010).
The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. The
protocol was approved by the institutional review board
(Hospital Vega Baja Ethics Committee). The patient gave her
written informed consent before entering the study and for
publishing the information appearing in this case report.
Results
MR imaging of the brain revealed severe atrophy in the left
hemisphere, mainly in the left posterior post-central gyrus,
anterior and posterior parietal lobe and ipsilateral occipital
cortex (Figure 1A) consistent with the SPECT-Tc99m-ECD
result, which displayed deficient cerebral perfusion in all these
regions (Figure 1B). DTI-MRI showed right corpus callosum
(CC) fibers connected properly to frontal, temporal, parietal
and occipital cortex (Figure 2A). By contrast, left CC fibers
displayed serious and wide disruption, which affected left
premotor, supplementary motor and motor cortex connections

BACKGROUND
Studying the abnormalities of self-body perception due to brain
damage has a key role in addressing questions regarding the
structure and functional signature of body consciousness (Pia
et al., 2013). This is the case of patients with pAHS who
commonly manifest body schema distortions such as the strong
feeling of foreignness or strangeness of one limb and other
parietal sensory deficits (Doody and Jankovic, 1992; Scepkowski
and Cronin-Golomb, 2003; Josephs and Rossor, 2004).
In the last 20 years our understanding of AHS subtypes has
evolved to the three, well-defined variants: the two anterior
(frontal and callosal) variants and the relatively recent added
posterior one (Sarva et al., 2014). The ‘‘posterior form’’ of
AHS has been related with impairment to the thalamus, the
posterolateral parietal cortex and the occipital lobe (Scepkowski
and Cronin-Golomb, 2003; Prakash et al., 2011). This variant
usually, though not exclusively, involves the non-dominant limb
(Kessler and Hathout, 2009; Kloesel et al., 2010). The alien
limb movements appear non-purposeful and non-conflictual
and patients could experience involuntary levitation of the arm
which may be task specific (Rohde et al., 2002; Gondim et al.,
2005; Prakash et al., 2011). In some cases, the alien hand
also could exhibit a bizarre position, called ‘‘parietal hand’’
in which the palmar surface is withdrawn from approaching
tools and the fingers move into an extremely extended posture
(Prakash et al., 2011; Sarva et al., 2014). Additionally, pAHS
can be accompanied by hemianesthesia, hemianopia, visuospatial

neglect (Yuan et al., 2011) and optic ataxia (Levine and Rinn,
1986) and some patients may have significant sensory deficits
without weakness (Spector et al., 2009).
pAHS could be produced by different neurodegenerative
conditions for instance, Creutzfeld–Jacob disease (Rubin et al.,
2012), Alzheimer’s disease, CBS or progressive supranuclear
palsy (Chand et al., 2006) as well as cerebrovascular accidents in
the thalamus, parietal cortex or posterior cerebral artery (Marey-
Lopez et al., 2002; Rohde et al., 2002; Gondim et al., 2005; Hassan
and Josephs, 2016).
Due to the relative low prevalence of this syndrome and
the limited reports of pAHS described, our understanding
of underlying mechanisms remains incomplete. On the one
hand, some authors noted the necessary implication of
parietal lobe in pathophysiology of pAHS. The parietal lobe
is a multimodal association area required for formation of
proprioceptive schemes which assist in the integration of
body image (Perez-Velazquez, 2012). Additionally, it receives
inputs from primary somatosensory and prefrontal cortices
and coordinates motor output (Perez-Velazquez, 2012). Because
of this, damage to parietal lobe could produce inability to
combine sensory input and motor output and may induce
impaired volitional movement execution, involuntary arm
levitation and release a pronounced feeling of estrangement
of a limb (Graff-Radford et al., 2013). On the other hand,
a distortion of body representation due to an anomalous
cortico-striato-thalamic network without significant parietal
lobe injury has been recently described as a cause of pAHS
(Filevich et al., 2012). Moreover, it is known that a thalamic
stroke with no frontal and parietal involvement may result
in pAHS with slight sensory loss (Bartolo et al., 2011).
Likewise, posterior cerebral artery stroke may evoke sensation
of limb foreignness secondary to the damage to the medial
paralimbic fibers implicated in limb awareness (Groom et al.,
1999). According to this, we could say that nowadays, the
neuroanatomical circuitry involved in pAHS is diverse and yet
poorly understood.
DISCUSSION
Here we focused on an unusual patient affected by CBS who
exhibited a constellation of symptoms consistent with pAHS in
her dominant right limb. Nevertheless, our case differs from
other reported cases of pAHS.
First of all, pAHS is classically described in non-dominant
limb (Scepkowski and Cronin-Golomb, 2003) and there have
been very few reports of lesions in the left hemisphere causing
pAHS of the dominant right upper extremity (Carrilho et al.,
2001; Rohde et al., 2002; Kessler and Hathout, 2009; Kloesel
et al., 2010). Leiguarda et al. (1993) described a patient who
developed right AHS following neurosurgical removal of a
vascular malformation from the left parietal cortex and Gondim
et al. (2005) reported a position-dependent levitation of the
dominant limb afterward left parietal cerebrovascular accident.
Nevertheless, there is anecdotal evidence from dominant pAHS
with atrophy in the left dominant parietal lobe. Kessler and
Hathout (2009) propose a precise localization of AHS of the
dominant hand through the report of a patient with left parietal
stroke and suggests that Brodmann area 5, which coincides
with the tertiary somatosensory cortex and is required in
stereognosis and post-central circumvolution, which is entailed
in kinesthesia, could trigger the anomalous movements and
the sensations of strangeness of an alien arm, even in the
dominant limb (Sarva et al., 2014). In the light of these
observations and our reported findings, it seems that pAHS
variant could not be restricted to non-dominant hemispheric
lesions.
Otherwise,
although
clinically
our
patient
presented
symptoms that remind one of the posterior alien hand variant,
neuroimaging revealed extensive damage that exceeds the
posterior parietal cortex causing a widespread disruption of left
CC connections from the rostral body to the splenium. These
results suggest that the sense of ownership over the alien hand
could be established by a wide spectrum of lesions, ranging
from purely anterior to purely posterior forms and hinted that
disruption of the motor centers from the parietal cortex probably
cause misperception, and developing an abnormal integration
between afferent multisensory signals and pre-existing body
presentations and the loss of consciousness of movement
(Graff-Radford et al., 2013; Sarva et al., 2014).
Furthermore, our patient exhibited a previously unreported
feature:
apparently
her
posterior
alien
arm
symptoms
exacerbated while piano playing. Playing the piano requires
the activation of multisensory and motor networks located in
distant but functionally related brain regions such as frontal,
parietal, and temporo-occipital cortices besides subcortical
structures such as basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum
(Altenmüller and Schlaug, 2015). Indeed, parietal lobe and
temporo-occipital cortices play a critical role for conscious
perception of sensory information. These areas work together
in order to integrate inputs from the auditory, visual, and
somatosensory system into a combined sensory impression
(Altenmüller and Schlaug, 2015). The functional links between
all these brain regions make possible the coupling of perception
and action for playing. As we described before, our patient
suffered from a widespread disruption of brain networks
involved frontal, parietal and temporo-occipital cortices and
first perceived impairment of the conscious and voluntary
movements of her right arm while playing the piano. It
has been known that uncoordinated hand movements or
involuntary levitation in patients with pAHS may be task-
specific. Kloesel et al. (2010) described a patient with pAHS
secondary to CBS who had exaggerated arm elevation only while
walking (Prakash et al., 2011) and in other cases, involuntary
movements are triggered or worsened by tactile stimulation
(Gondim et al., 2005), sudden noises or coughing (Rohde
et al., 2002). Levitation in our patient appeared when attention
decreased and were not related to a specific position of the
arm. It is certain that levitation exacerbated while piano
playing. In addition, she first noticed impairment of the
controlled movement of her right hand during piano execution.
However, we consider that playing a musical instrument
demands the suitable perception of the limb position and
motion in space and requires a fine visual, proprioceptive

and motor integration (Pascual-Leone, 2001). Most of the
networks which take part in these processes are damaged in our
patient.
Regarding the differential aspects of our findings with
task-specific dystonia in pianists, our patient did not display
the typical cramps, hyperextensions and flexions of the hand
while playing the piano which is commonly described in
task-specific dystonia of musicians. It is known that the
posterior variant of AHS can be accompanied by other
features such as atypical hand posture sometimes referred
to as a ‘‘parietal hand’’ (Prakash et al., 2011) and other
cortical sensory deficits like hemianesthesia and hemineglect
which cause a poor proprioceptive awareness and could
restrict the skill for playing (Scepkowski and Cronin-Golomb,
2003).
CONCLUDING REMARKS
This case report shows that pAHS could appear in the
dominant limb from a widespread disruption of brain networks
which exceeds left posterolateral parietal and occipital cortices.
Moreover, these symptoms could get worse during a specific
task as playing the piano. Further imaging research is needed
in order to understand the neural pathways involved in pAHS.
A combination of neurological assessment and anatomical and
functional imaging may provide invaluable information about
relationship between clinical features and anatomic localization
of pAHS and contribute to further expand our knowledge about
this rare condition and anomalous self-body perception.
