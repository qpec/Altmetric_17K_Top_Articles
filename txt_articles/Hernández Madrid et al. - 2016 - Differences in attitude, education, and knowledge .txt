The purpose of this patient survey was to analyse the knowledge about blood thinning medications relative to gender, age, education, and region of
residence in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). A total of 1147 patients with AF [mean age 66+13 years, 529 (45%) women] from eight European
countries responded to this survey. Most patients understood that the indication for anticoagulation therapy was to ‘thin the blood’, but 8.1%
responded that the purpose of the medication was to treat the arrhythmia. Patients with college or university grades reported less frequent devia-
tions from their target INR range compared with those without schooling (2.8% vs. 5.1%, P , 0.05). The awareness of anticoagulation-related risk
of bleedings was lowest in patients without schooling (38.5%) and highest in those with college and university education (57.0%), P , 0.05. The
same pattern was also observed regarding patient’s awareness of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs): 56.5% of the patients
with university education and only 20.5% of those without schooling (P , 0.05) knew about NOACs, indicating that information about new antic-
oagulation therapies remains well below the target. Bleeding events were statistically less frequent in patients on NOACs compared with vitamin K
antagonists. The education level and patients’ knowledge have a direct influence on the global management of the anticoagulation.

Introduction
Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the most effective therapy for the
prevention of ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism related to at-
rial fibrillation (AF).1,2 The greatest clinical benefit of OAC is
achieved with active close collaboration between physicians and
AF patients at risk of stroke.1,2 Shared decision making regarding
the initiation of OAC, as well as long-term adherence to OAC ther-
apy are facilitated by informed patient participation in the process of
treatment.
Medical management of patients with AF is continuously improv-
ing due to the adoption to guidelines with better risk stratification,
and perhaps better adherence to therapy, including non-vitamin K
oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The way of transmitting the

 knowledge may have important implications for the adherence to
guidelines and treatment outcomes. There may be regional differ-
ences regarding OAC use, although less is known about the patient’s
education and knowledge in different countries.
The purpose of this European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA)
survey was to analyse the knowledge and attitude towards throm-
boprohylactic medications in relation to gender, age, education,
and region of residence among AF patients.
Methods
The survey was designed and approved by the members of the EHRA
Scientific Initiatives Committee in collaboration with the French Nation-
al College of Cardiologists (CNCH), as previously described.3 The un-
derstanding and ease of use of the survey questionnaire was tested in
advance in clinical practice to obviate misinterpretations by participating
patients. The questionnaire, consisting of 40 questions in patients’ native
language, was created on an online electronic platform, and the link was
sent to the EHRA Electrophysiology (EP) Research Network centres.
The countries invited to participate were France, Denmark, Sweden,
Spain, Norway, Germany, Italy, and the UK, all of which had country co-
ordinators in the Scientific Initiatives Committee. The EP Research Net-
work centres were instructed to approach hospitals, outpatient clinics,
and specific patient associations or organizations. In-hospital and outpa-
tients diagnosed with AF and taking OAC were eligible. Each patient was
asked to enter their individual data without any interference from med-
ical staff. All data were collected anonymously, and the study was con-
ducted during a 3-month period.
Statistical analysis
Values are expressed as mean +standard deviation for continuous data
and as numbers or percentages for categorical data. Distributions of cat-
egorical data were examined by the x2 test or Fisher’s exact test, as ap-
propriate. Continuous data were compared using Student’s t-test or the
Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. The normal distribution of data
was tested using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests.
The analyses were performed using SPSS software for windows, version
19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
Patient population
Of 1147 patients participating in the survey, 529 (46.1%) were wo-
men; mean age was 66+ 13 years. The patients were from France
(386 patients, 33.6%), Denmark, (305, 26.6%), Sweden, (240,
20.9%), Spain (88, 7.7%), Norway, (51, 4.5%), Germany (43, 3.7%),
UK, (25, 2.2%), and Italy (9 patients, 0.8%).
The survey contained the question whether a patient had an on-
going ‘blood thinning’ medication or not, and which of the listed
‘blood thinning’ agents the patient was currently taking, including
country-specific trade names of anticoagulants and antiplatelet
agents. There were no differences in NOAC use with respect to
age or gender. A total of 160 men (25.8%) and 123 woman
(23.9%) were treated with NOAC (P ¼ 0.42). The use of specific
anticoagulants differed across Europe. Among the vitamin K antago-
nists (VKA), warfarin was most frequently used in Denmark, Ger-
many, Norway, Sweden, and UK than in France or Spain (88% in
Norway vs. 4.7% in Spain), while acenocumarol was most frequently
used in Spain (91.2%); and fluindione in France (77.1%) (P , 0.05).
Aspirin as an antiplatelet agent was most commonly used in Norway
(22%) and lowest in France (7%) (Figure 1). The use of clopidogrel,
prasugrel, or ticagrelor was similar.
The use of VKAs, NOACs, and antiplatelet agents reported by pa-
tients differed across the countries. There were also regional differ-
ences regarding the preference of a certain NOAC or anticoagulant
as reported by patients participating in this survey. Dabigatran was
more frequently used in Denmark and Sweden, apixaban was more
frequently used in Germany, and rivaroxaban was preferred in
France, Spain, and Norway.

 for anticoagulation therapy was to ‘thin the blood’. However, a non-
negligible proportion of patients (6–9%) replied that the treatment
was to control the arrhythmia. Regarding adherence to therapy,
28.7% of men and 24.5% of women (P , 0.05) reported forgetting
to take their medication occasionally; younger patients were more
likely to forget their medication than patients over 65 years (31.3 vs.
24%, P , 0.05).
The frequency of blood tests for monitoring of OAC therapy did
not differ across countries, and monthly testing was most common.
When asked about their INR targets, 91% knew that the INR target
level should be kept between 2 and 3, while 3% believed it should
be , 2, and 6% believed that the target INR should be . 3.
Most of the patients state they can continue their normal daily life
activities, such as travelling by plane, participating in sport, driving a
car or having a job, being more frequently acknowledged by men
than by women (P , 0.05).
Discontinuation of anticoagulation was reported by 14.5% of par-
ticipants. The reason for the withdrawal of therapy was unknown in
25.8% of the younger patients and 21.1% of the older individuals
(P , 0.05), while the second most common reason was discontinu-
ation by their doctors (8.9% in younger and 11.8% in older patients,
P , 0.05), and the third most common cause was that the patient
did not want regular blood test.
Of the entire cohort, 40% of the patients were informed of the
availability of NOACs. However, many patients were not aware of
the fact that blood tests were not necessary for testing the efficacy
of NOACs, (29.6% men and 32.7% women). A minority of the pa-
tients (25.8% of men and 28.4% of women) recognized that NOACs
were at least as effective as warfarin (Table 1). The knowledge about
the need for regular kidney function tests and to a certain extent li-
ver function monitoring, and potentials interactions with other
drugs, which should be avoided, generally was low, ranging between
15 and 38%, particularly in patients who were not on NOACs.
Role of education
The use of aspirin was reported by 10.1–20% of the patients, most
frequently by those with some college credit and less commonly by
patients with college or university education and patients with nur-
sery school to 8th grade patients. The use of NOACs ranged from
29.5% in patients with some college credit to 17.9% in patients with-
out schooling (P , 0.05%).
The educational level did not differ between patients who were
aware of the purpose of the OAC therapy ‘to thin the blood’ and
those who believed that the drugs were used for the arrhythmia
per se. Patients with a high educational level (college or university
degree) more frequently managed their dosing themselves com-
pared with other groups (21.9 vs. 12.9% in patients without school-
ing; P , 0.05). Patients have also been asked whether INR ever go
higher than the upper limit of the target level. Patients without
schooling were more likely to report that INR exceeded the upper
limit several times a month (5.1 vs. 2.8% of college or university-
educated patients, P , 0.05).
The majority (80.2%) of patients with university education knew
that they could continue their normal daily activities such as travel-
ling by plane, sports, driving a car, or having a job, compared with
patients without schooling (51.8%, P , 0.05).
A higher proportion (56.5%) of patients with university education
have heard about NOACs as opposed to only 20.5% of patients
without schooling (P , 0.05); thus, this awareness remains relatively
low; 15.3% of the patients without schooling did not know that
blood tests were not necessary for NOACs, in contrast to what
was required for warfarin. The fact NOACs are at least as effective
as warfarin was recognized by 2.5% of patients without schooling
and 25% of patients with trade/technical education, and up to
42.4% of patients with university education (P , 0.05).
Patients without schooling reported the highest rate of bleeding
on anticoagulant, and the highest rate of previous stroke (2.6% as
compared with 0.71% in those with college and university educa-
tion, P , 0.05) (Table 2). These patients also had the lowest use
of VKAs or NOACs for prevention of stroke, even after correction
for other possible factors that may influence appropriate OAC ther-
apy. The use of NOACs was also less frequent, than the use of
VKAs, ranging from 17.9% in patients without schooling to the
25.8% in patients with college or university education and 29.1%
in patients with some college credit.
Bleeding events
History of bleeding was reported by 13% of patients. More than half
the patients (54%) declared that anticoagulation was associated with
increased risk of minor bleeding, while 26% believed that it increased
risk of all bleedings (including major bleeding). The perception of low
risk of anticoagulation, as well as the perception of no risk at all, was

 similar in all countries. The only statistically significant parameter was
the intake of NOAC, which was associated with a lower rate of bleed-
ing than that observed in patients taking VKA (P , 0.05).
Discussion
According to the results of our survey, there were no age-related
differences regarding the use of VKAs and NOACs. There was a sig-
nificant proportion of patients (around 8%) who did not understand
the purpose of anticoagulation correctly. Surprisingly, the number
of patients who were aware of NOACs was also quite small. A small
percentage of patients used ‘self-medication’, i.e. managing the dose
of VKAs themselves, both among the younger and older patients.
Gender-related differences in the clinical presentation and out-
come seem to relate to differences in platelet biology and coagulation
reactions, resulting in different rates of thromboembolic and bleeding
events, according to previous studies.4–6 However, the understand-
ing and management of anticoagulation could also be important. Simi-
lar proportions of men and women discontinued anticoagulation
therapy, which was most frequently related to the advice from their
doctors. In our survey, there were no significant differences in the
management of OAC treatment by gender, apart from the observa-
tion that men more frequently than women managed the dosing
themselves.
This survey provides some insights into the current patient’s
knowledge, education, and compliance regarding OAC therapy.
Despite the widespread guidelines on management of AF,4,5 there
are significant regional differences regarding age, gender, country,
and educational level among AF patients across Europe. The
EHRA Practical Guide for NOAC use6,7 recommends mandatory
regular monitoring of renal function on a yearly basis in patients
with normal or mild renal impairment and more frequently in pa-
tients with moderate renal impairment. Widespread education pro-
grammes on AF and anticoagulation are needed for physicians, as
well as user friendly patient educational material to overcome re-
gional differences in OAC therapy.
The prospective study by Poli et al. 8 found no differences regard-
ing the quality of anticoagulation or bleeding risk between the gen-
ders (P ¼ 0.5). The higher rate of embolic events in women
compared with men was confirmed using Cox regression analysis
after correction for age (P ¼ 0.009). Strokes occurring in women
were more disabling, and relative risk (RR) for severe and fatal
stroke, defined according to the modified Rankin scale, in women
vs. men was 3.1 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.3–6.5; P ¼
0.001], despite the similar quality of anticoagulation.
Medical management of patients with AF is continuously improving
because of better adherence to the guidelines, better risk stratification,
and perhaps a quick adoption of NOACs. The PREFER in AF (PREven-
tion oF thromboembolic events—European Registry in Atrial Fibrilla-
tion) registry analysed 7243 consecutive patients with AF in seven
European countries in 2012–13.9,10 Patients were older than in our
survey (mean age 71.5+10.7 years) and had a higher mean CHA2-
DS2–VASc score (3.4). The study showed important differences in
the use of anticoagulation across countries. Warfarin was used pre-
dominantly in the UK (74.9%), phenprocoumon in Germany (74.1%),
acenocoumarol in Spain (67.3%), and fluindione in France (61.8%).
The NOAC use ranged from 31.9% in Swedish patients to 8.2% in
Norway (P , 0.05%) in our survey. There were regional differences
regarding the preference for certain anticoagulants. Dabigatran was
more frequently used in Denmark and Sweden, apixaban in Ger-
many, and rivaroxaban was more frequently used in France, Spain,
and Norway. These differences may be difficult to interpret, but
could at least in part be related to problems in introducing a new
product into the market by each government and also due to differ-
ences in reimbursement among countries.
Temporary VKA discontinuation and bridging with other anticoa-
gulants was frequent, and time in the therapeutic range defined as at
least two of the last three available INR values between 2.0 and 3.0
prior to enrolment, ranged from 70.3% in Spain to 81.4% in Ger-
many. The global quality of anticoagulation management was rela-
tively homogenous across countries.
Educational differences
Patients with the highest educational level were more frequently
treated with NOACs [29.5% in patients with some college credit
to 17.9% in patients without schooling (P , 0.05%)]. The continu-
ation of OAC therapy may be affected by diet modifications, other
drugs, co-morbidities, compliance, and patient’s education.11 –14 In
our survey, there were important education-related differences re-
garding information given about anticoagulation, management, and
permitted patient activities. Even among university-educated pa-
tients not all knew about NOACs. The perception of risk imposed
by anticoagulants was also different.
The study on patient’s education with respect to OAC therapy
showed that a greater emphasis should be given to educational
courses for anticoagulated patients; administration of the question-
naire leads to a significant improvement in anticoagulation quality.15
Educational interventions significantly influence the patient’s knowl-
edge and perception of AF. Other surveys emphasized the need for
structured educational programs to improve the use of OAC. Re-
cently, an EHRA consensus document emphasized the need for
education of patients with AF.16
Conclusion
The differences in the educational level may compromise the safety
and efficacy of anticoagulants. The results of this survey show that
there is still a place for improvement of education and compliance
among patients on OAC. Education of AF patients should be
