IMPORTANCE Chinese American individuals are a fast-growing segment of people in the
United States, but the burden and effect of diabetic complications on this group of people is
not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE To determine the age- and sex-specific prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR)
overall and by severity, duration of diabetes, and treatment history in adult Chinese American
individuals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Chinese American Eye Study (CHES), a
population-based, cross-sectional study, was conducted from February 2010 to October 2013
for 10 census tracts in Monterey Park, California. This analysis, conducted between February
16, 2010, and October 9, 2013, included 4582 Chinese residents 50 years and older.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of nonproliferative DR, proliferative DR, and
macular edema, as well as stereoscopic fundus photography of 7 standard Early Treatment
Diabetic Retinopathy Study fields.
RESULTS Of the 4582 survey participants, most were first-generation immigrants from China
(68.7%) and female (63%). In total, 736 participants (16.1%) were identified as having type 2
diabetes. Fundus photographs were gradable for 665 (90.4%) of these participants. The
reproducibility of DR grading was evaluated throughout study and showed moderate to
excellent agreement (weighted κ = 0.78-0.97). Diabetic retinopathy was present in 35.8% of
people with diabetes (95% CI, 32.1%-39.6%). The estimated prevalence of severe
nonproliferative DR and proliferative DR was 1.7% (95% CI, 0.8%-2.9%) and 2.4% (95% CI,
1.4%-3.9%), respectively. Macular edema was observed among 4.5% of people with diabetes
(95% CI, 3.0%-6.4%), and clinically significant macular edema was observed among 2.0%
(95% CI, 1.1%-3.3%). The prevalence of DR was higher (56%) among participants with a
longer duration of diabetes (�15 years; P < .001). The prevalence of visual impairment
(best-corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye) among participants
with diabetes was higher than those without diabetes (6.7% vs 2.2% = difference of 4.5%;
95% CI, 3.9%-5.1%). The primary causes of visual impairment in participants with diabetes
were cataracts (38% of participants; 95% CI, 36.6%-39.4%) followed by macular edema (7%
of participants; 95% CI, 6.3%-7.7%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Data from CHES and this study indicate that the prevalence of
DR in the Chinese American Eye Study Group is relatively lower than studies of Chinese
individuals residing in rural northern China or Latino individuals from Los Angeles County,
California.

D
iabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common
complications of diabetes1 and is a leading cause of vi-
sual impairment and blindness among adults in the
United States.2,3 The growing number of older adults af-
fected by diabetes and complications of diabetes worldwide
underscores the importance of accurate assessment of the bur-
denofDR.4Population-baseddataontheprevalenceofDRsug-
gest that DR varies across racial/ethnic groups.5-11 In the United
States, studies have been completed on non-Hispanic white
and Hispanic populations5-11; however, population-based data
on the prevalence of DR in Chinese American individuals are
limited, despite the fact that they constitute one of the fastest-
growing populations in the United States.12,13 Between 2000
and 2010, the number of Chinese American individuals in the
United States increased by nearly 40%.14 Existing data from
Asian individuals living in Asia cannot be directly extrapo-
lated to Chinese American individuals owing to differences in
environmental and behavioral factors, including dietary dif-
ferences,reducedphysicalactivity,anddifferentaccesstocare.
Knowledge of the prevalence and characteristics of DR in Chi-
nese American individuals is needed to improve effective
disease prevention and treatment programs and to inform
health care policies. To our knowledge, the Chinese Ameri-
canEyeStudy(CHES)isthelargest,mostcomprehensivepopu-
lation-based study of eye disease among persons of Chinese
ancestry 50 years and older, and specifically Chinese Ameri-
can individuals, designed to provide precise estimates of the
overall and age- and sex-specific prevalence of DR.
Methods
Study Cohort
Participants for CHES were recruited from the city of Mon-
terey Park in Los Angeles County, California, and examined
from February 2010 to October 2013. The study protocol and
informed consent forms were reviewed and approved by the
institutional review board of the University of Southern Cali-
fornia, and all study procedures adhered to the recommenda-
tions of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from each participant. Data analysis was
performed between February 16, 2010, and October 9, 2013.
The study population consisted of 4582 noninstitutionalized
Chinese American individuals 50 years and older from cen-
sus tracts selected for their high proportion of Chinese Ameri-
can residents. Details of the study design and sampling plan
have been described previously.15
Inbrief,adoor-to-doorcensusofalldwellingunitswasper-
formed to identify eligible participants. Eligible adults were
invited to participate, and written informed consent was ob-
tained at the time of study enrollment. Interviews were con-
ducted at participants’homes to collect detailed data on so-
ciodemographic, behavioral, and health care access and use
factors.
Clinicvisitsincludedcomprehensiveeyeexaminationsper-
formed by trained and certified ophthalmologists using stan-
dardized protocols. Measurements of glycosylated hemoglo-
bin and random blood glucose levels were obtained from each
participant. Participants with diabetes underwent stereo-
scopic photography of 7 standard Early Treatment Diabetic
Retinopathy Study fields (field 1, the center of the optic disc;
field2,thecenterofthemacula;field3,temporaltothemacula;
field 4, temporal superior; field 5, temporal inferior; field 6,
nasal superior; and field 7, nasal inferior) of the fundus for each
eye with the Topcon TRC 50EX Retinal Camera (Topcon
Corporation of America) after maximal dilation.
Definitions of Diabetes
We defined diabetes in the following ways: (1) the participant
self-reported a history of diabetes and was undergoing treat-
ment with oral hypoglycemic medications, insulin, or diet or
with a combination of these treatments; or (2) the partici-
pant’
s hemoglobin A1c level was measured at 6.5% or higher.
Diabetes was considered to be type 1 if the participant was
treated with insulin therapy and aged 30 years or younger at
diabetes onset. Otherwise, diabetes was considered to be type
2. Diabetes was categorized as newly diagnosed if the partici-
pant did not report a history of diabetes and was not being
treated but the participant’
s hemoglobin A1c measurement was
6.5% or higher at clinic visit.
Definitions and Grading of DR
Diabeticretinopathywasdefinedasretinopathyinpersonswith
diabetes. Fundus photographs were graded in a masked man-
ner at the Ocular Epidemiology Grading Center at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin in Madison. Grading protocols for DR were
modifications of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy
Study adaptation of the modified Airlie House classification
of DR. For each eye, the maximum grade in any of the 7 stan-
dard photographic fields was determined for each of the
lesions. Eyes were classified according to the following
criteria: (1) no DR (levels 10-13) or (2) any DR (levels 14-85).
Diabetic retinopathy was further classified into different
severity levels: (1) mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR, levels 14-
20), moderate NPDR (levels 31-43), or severe NPDR (levels 47-
53); or (2) proliferative DR (PDR; levels 60-85). The reproduc-
ibility and reliability of DR grading were evaluated throughout
study data collection. The assessment consisted of grading 60
participants every 6 months, measured by weighted κ statis-
tics. The results showed moderate to excellent intergrader
agreement (weighted κ = 0.78-0.97) and intragrader agree-
ment (weighted κ = 0.84-0.99).
Key Points
Question What is the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in the
Chinese American Eye Study?
Findings In this population-based cross-sectional study of
Chinese-American individuals, diabetic retinopathy was present in
35.8% of participants with diabetes and in 56% of those with
diabetes for more than 15 years.
Meaning This study identified a lower prevalence of diabetic
retinopathy among Chinese American individuals than studies of
Chinese individuals residing in rural northern China or Latino
individuals from Los Angeles County, California.

Definition of Macular Edema
Macular edema (ME) was defined as a thickening of the retina
with or without partial loss of transparency within 1 disc di-
ameter of the center of the macula. Clinically significant ME
was defined as the presence of any one of the following crite-
ria: (1) retinal thickening at or within 500 μm of the center of
the macula, hard exudates at or within 500 μm of the center
ofthemaculaassociatedwiththickeningoftheadjacentretina,
or both; or (2) a zone or zones of retinal thickening 1 disc area
in size, at least part of which was within 1 disc diameter of the
center. Optical coherence tomography of the macula was not
used to determine the presence of macular edema.
Statistical Analysis
The prevalence of DR was calculated as the proportion of
participants with DR in 1 or both eyes to the total number
of participants with diabetes and with a gradable fundus
photograph. The prevalence by severity of DR, age, and sex
were calculated, and their 95% CIs were also reported. We used
χ2 tests to evaluate the age- and sex-specific differences in DR
prevalence and to evaluate the association of DR with dura-
tion of diabetes. All analyses were completed using SAS ver-
sion 9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc). All reported P values were
2-sided with a .05 significance level.
Results
Study Cohort
Of the 5782 residents identified as eligible, 4582 (79%) com-
pleted a home interview and clinical examination (eFigure in
the Supplement). Most of the participants (3149 [68.7%]) were
first-generation immigrants from China. Compared with Chi-
nese American individuals throughout the Unites States, CHES
participants were similar in age to those in the United States
as a whole (47% [n = 2180] were aged 50-59 years in CHES vs
44% [n = 1 070 000] in the United States), more likely to be fe-
male (63% [n = 2901] in CHES vs 52% [n = 1 260 000] in the
United States), and were less likely to have 12 or more years of
education (67% [n = 3090] in CHES vs 77% [n = 1 870 000] in
the United States).14
Comparedwithparticipantswhocompletedtheclinicalex-
amination,eligibleparticipantswhodidnotcompletetheclini-
cal examination were similar in age (mean age, 63 vs 61 years),
slightly more likely to be current smokers (12% [n = 103] vs 7%
[n = 304]),lesslikelytohave12ormoreyearsofeducation(58%
[n = 491] vs 67% [n = 3090]), and just as likely to speak Eng-
lish (59% [n = 2695] vs 52% [n = 445]). Among the 4582 par-
ticipants, 736 (16.1%) were identified as having diabetes, and
all were characterized as having type 2 diabetes. Gradable fun-
dus photographs were obtained from at least 1 eye for 665 par-
ticipants (90.4%); 71 participants with diabetes were ex-
cluded from the analysis because of missing (n = 35) or
ungradable fundus photographs owing to poor photograph
quality (n = 36).
Prevalence of DR and Macular Edema
Among the 665 Chinese American participants with diabe-
tes, 238 (35.8%) had DR (95% CI = 32.1%-39.6%). The preva-
lence of mild, moderate, and severe NPDR and PDR were 19.9%
(n = 132), 11.9% (n = 79), 1.7% (n = 11), and 2.4% (n = 16), re-
spectively.Thirtyparticipants(4.5%;95%CI = 3.0%-6.4%)had
ME,and13(2.0%;95%CI = 1.1%-3.3%)wereconsideredtohave
clinically significant ME (Table 1). The prevalence of DR and
ME were lowest in the oldest age group (≥80 years) and rela-
tively higher in younger age groups. However, there were no
trends in the prevalence of DR or ME with older age groups.
Males had a higher prevalence of moderate DR (15.0%
[n = 46] vs 9.2% [n = 33]; P = .02) and proliferative DR (3.6%
[n = 11] vs 1.4% [n = 5]; P = .049) than females, after adjust-
ing for age. However, no sex-specific differences were noted
for the prevalence of any DR or for ME.

Clinical Characteristics of DR
Among the 238 participants with any DR, 92 had DR in both
eyes and 132 had DR in only 1 eye (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). Most of the bilateral DR cases were moderate NPDR
(59.8% [n = 55]), while most of the unilateral DR cases were
mild NPDR (87.1% [n = 127]) (data not shown).
The most common clinical characteristic of DR was mi-
croaneurysms or retinal hemorrhages (95.8% [n = 228] in all
DR) (eTable 1 in the Supplement), which was in 93.2% (123) of
unilateral DR cases and in 98.9% (91) of bilateral DR cases.
Prevalence of DR by Duration of Diabetes
Among the 665 Chinese American participants with diabe-
tes, 205 participants (30.8%) were newly diagnosed as hav-
ing diabetes at the clinical examination. This group of partici-
pants was similar to those whose diabetes was diagnosed
previously with respect to sex (P = .51) and body mass index
(P = .05), but they were relatively younger than people previ-
ously diagnosed as having diabetes (mean [SD] age, 61.0 [8.1]
years vs 65.7 [9.7] years; P < .001) and had slightly higher
hemoglobin A1c levels (7.3% vs 7.0% of total hemoglobin [to
convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01];
P = .01).
The prevalence of any DR and ME was higher in partici-
pants with a longer duration of diabetes (Figure). The preva-
lence of any DR in persons with diabetes for 15 years or longer
(56.1% [n = 55]) was more than double in persons who were
newly diagnosed as having diabetes (28.8% [n = 57]). The
prevalence of PDR in persons with diabetes for 15 years or lon-
ger (10.2% [n = 10]) was 10-fold higher than those who were
newly diagnosed as having diabetes (1.0% [n = 2]).
Prevalence of DR in Type 2 Diabetes by Treatment
Of the 460 participants with previously diagnosed diabetes,
45 were prescribed insulin or insulin-combined treatments,
while 372 were prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents alone or
together with diet modification (Table 2). The prevalence of
DR, especially severe NPDR and PDR, was highest among par-
ticipants who were treated with insulin (any DR, 64.4%
[n = 29]; severe NPDR, 6.7% [n = 3]; and PDR, 13.3% [n = 6]).

withoutdiabetes(6.7%[n = 47]vs2.2%[n = 73];P < .001).The
prevalence of blindness (best-corrected visual acuity of 20/
200 or less in the worse-seeing eye) was also 3 times higher
among participants with diabetes compared with those
without diabetes (3.9% [n = 27] vs 1.3% [n = 43]; P < .001). The
primary diabetes-related causes for visual impairment were
cataracts(49%[n = 23];95%CI = 34%-64%)andME(7%[n = 3];
95% = CI 6.3%-7.7%) (data not shown).
Comparison With Other Studies
Detailed comparisons of the age-specific and age-adjusted
prevalence of DR between similar population-based studies
from the CHES population suggest a different pattern of DR
prevalence for those persons of Chinese ancestry in China and
Singapore (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Discussion
To our knowledge, CHES is the largest and most comprehen-
sive population-based study of eye disease among people of
Chinese ancestry 50 years and older, both within and outside
the United States. In this study, we present data on the preva-
lence and characteristics of DR in Chinese American adults re-
siding in Los Angeles County, California. Chinese American
populations are highly concentrated in this region of Califor-
nia, which provides a unique opportunity to characterize the
burden and severity of eye disease in the fastest-growing ra-
cial group of the US population.13 In this cohort of adults 50
yearsorolder,theprevalenceofDRwas35.8%(95%CI = 32.1%-
39.6%), and the prevalence of ME and clinically significant ME
was 4.5% (95% CI = 3.0%-6.4%) and 2.0% (95% CI = 1.1%-
3.3%), respectively.
Although there have been other studies of DR in Chinese
American individuals (such as the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis),16 the total number of Chinese American par-
ticipants in those studies was too small to provide accurate es-
timates, and the sample was selected to exclude participants
with evidence of cardiovascular disease. Population-based
studies of DR in China have also been conducted17,18; how-
ever, important environmental and lifestyle differences exist
for Chinese American individuals compared with rural and ur-
banpopulationslivinginChina.Ancestral,environmental,and
lifestyle differences between countries may result in impor-
tant variations in the prevalence of DR.
Differences in protocol used to collect and analyze data
from CHES and other population-based studies could result in
different estimates of DR prevalence. In CHES, each partici-
pant underwent stereoscopic retinal photography of 7 stan-
dardEarlyTreatmentDiabeticRetinopathyStudyfundusfields
to ascertain the presence of DR. Previous population-based
studies of Chinese participants did not perform the same stan-
dardized examinations used in CHES. Some studies (eg, the
Shihpai Eye Study in Taiwan,19 the Liwan Eye Study in urban
China,20 the Tajong Pagar Study in urban Singapore,21 and the
China Nine-Province Survey22) did not take fundus photo-
graphs for the diagnosis of DR, while other studies used
nonstereoscopic photography (Beijing Eye Study18) or stereo
photography of fewer fields (the Handan Eye Study in rural
China,17 which used 2 fundus fields). The use of nonstereo-
scopic photography in select studies may have resulted in
fewer cases of DR being detected than could have been
identified with stereoscopic retinal photography of 7 stan-
dard Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study fields.
Another challenge is that available data from studies of DR
based their diagnoses on different definitions of diabetes
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). For example, diabetes was
defined using hemoglobin A1c level, history of diabetes, and
treatment based on recent guidelines in CHES,23 whereas in
the Handan Eye Study, diabetes was diagnosed by fasting
glucose level.17 The higher prevalence of DR in the Handan
Eye Study compared with CHES could be influenced by the
use of fasting glucose alone to define diabetes, which may
result in overestimation of diabetes.
The age-standardized prevalence of DR in CHES partici-
pants in the United States (41.0%) was lower compared with
that in Chinese residents in rural northern China (Handan Eye
Study, 45.7%17) and that of Latino individuals from Los Ange-
les (Los Angeles Latino Eye Study [LALES], 48.1%11). The dif-
ferences were more pronounced among individuals who had
diabetesfor10ormoreyears(50.3%inCHESvs88%inHandan
EyeStudy,17and57.3%inCHES[usinghemoglobinA1ccutpoint
of 7%] vs 77.9% in LALES11). The same pattern was observed
for the prevalence of ME. The age-standardized prevalence of
ME in CHES was 4.7%, lower than the 5.7% observed in the
HandanEyeStudy17andthe10.5%inLALES11(datanotshown).
Differences between the prevalence of DR and ME in CHES and
the Handan Eye Study17 may be explained in part by the fact
that participants in CHES are from an urban population and
Handan is a rural population. While the reasons for these dif-
ferencesneedadditionalstudy,somecontributingfactorscould
be differences in dietary habits and potentially earlier screen-
ing and intervention for diabetes in urban environments ow-
ing to better access to health care. We also observed the preva-

than in Chinese American individuals in CHES, although the
2 studies shared identical study protocols and similar urban
environments. Future analyses will explore the biologic, oph-
thalmic, and lifestyle factors that may be associated with the
presence of DR in CHES participants.
The age-standardized DR prevalence was higher in CHES
than in African Caribbean individuals in the Barbados Eye
Study24 and in non-Hispanic white individuals in the Beaver
DamEyeStudy25(41.0%vs28.1%and36.7%,respectively).This
difference was mainly observed among patients with diabe-
teswhowerediagnosedrecently(withinthepast5years;31.8%
vs 11.9% and 22.9%, respectively), suggesting that cultural or
environmental differences in use of care may have contrib-
uted to these observed differences. In addition, recent im-
provements in the diagnosis and better management of dia-
betes and its complications23 may provide earlier detection of
retinopathy.

lation-based studies, including the Handan Eye Study17 and in
LALES.11 Within the CHES population, there was also a higher
prevalence of DR in people with diabetes treated with insulin
compared with those treated with oral hypoglycemic agents
or diet modification. The higher prevalence of DR in partici-
pants treated with insulin was also present in Latino individu-
als (LALES).11 One explanation for this is that insulin use may
be a marker for people with poor glycemic control compared
with those who only take oral hypoglycemic medications. The
lower prevalence of DR observed among people with diabe-
tes using both oral medications and modified diet compared
with those who were taking oral medications only (42.4% vs
29.7%; P = .01; data not shown) suggests an interesting asso-
ciation that needs further exploration.
One limitation of our study was the inability to obtain the
exactageatwhichparticipantsdevelopeddiabetes,whichmay
misclassify the exact time of diagnosis. In addition, while we
may have slightly underestimated the prevalence of DR be-
cause those who did not participate were slightly older, there
were no differences in vision coverage and self-reported his-
toryofdiabetesbetweenparticipantsandnonparticipants,thus
making the difference most likely small. Not including opti-
calcoherencetomographicdataforevaluatingdiabeticMEmay
have been a limitation, and future studies are needed to com-
pare clinically diagnosed diabetic ME and optical coherence
tomographic evaluation.
The CHES cohort is composed mostly of Mandarin-
speaking immigrants, 68.7% of whom were from mainland
China. While there are small differences between the Chinese
American individuals included in this study and those in the
United States, we believe these data are representative of Chi-
nese American individuals. However, caution is warranted
when extrapolating these estimates to Chinese populations of
different geographic or genetic heritage, as differences in these
characteristics may contribute to differences in the burden of
DR. Therefore, age-specific or age-standardized estimates
should be used to compare prevalence differences across Chi-
nese populations.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, CHES is the largest and most comprehen-
sivestudyofeyediseaseinpersonsofChineseancestry50years
andolderandprovidespreciseestimatesoftheoverallandage-
and sex-specific prevalence of DR. Further studies are needed
to explore why Chinese American individuals in CHES have a
lowerprevalenceofDRcomparedwithstudiesofChinesepeople
living in rural China or Latino individuals in the United States.
While these potential explanations include population differ-
ences in genetic susceptibility, environment, and lifestyle fac-
tors, a detailed, careful assessment seems warranted.

Invited Commentary
Observations From a Population-Based Study of Diabetic
Retinopathy in Chinese Americans
Ching-Yu Cheng, MD, PhD; Tien Yin Wong, MBBS, PhD, FRCS(Ed)
Population-based epidemiologic studies address 3 principal
questions:howmanypeopleareaffectedbythedisease(preva-
lence);whowilldevelopthisdiseaseovertime(incidence),and
who is at risk for the disease and why they are at risk (analy-
ses of risk factors). Over the
past few decades, findings
from population-based stud-
ies of ocular diseases have
provided such information that guides clinical care and allow
policy makers to design disease-screening programs and re-
latedpublichealthstrategiestominimizetheimpactofeyedis-
eases in different communities.
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss
in working-aged people globally. In the 1980s, classic epide-
miological studies, such as the Wisconsin Epidemiologic
Study of Diabetic Retinopathy, provided comprehensive data
on the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of DR.1 Since
then, several population-based studies on DR have been con-
ducted in the United States in both populations of European
ancestry (white individuals) and other racial/ethnic groups,
such as African American and Hispanic individuals.2,3
Likewise, estimates on DR prevalence have been reported
from other continents, including Europe, Australia, and Asia.
A pooled analysis of 23 000 patients with diabetes from 35
population-based studies worldwide showed that the overall
prevalence of DR was 35%, with 7% having vision-
threatening DR4 (severe nonproliferative DR, proliferative
DR, or diabetic macular edema).
Findings from such population-based studies across dif-
ferent racial/ethnic groups, geographic regions, and periods
provide important insight into how the risk for DR has been
influenced by increasing urbanization and globalization,
changes in demographics and lifestyle (such as changes in diet
that increase the risk for obesity), and population immigra-
tion and acculturation.
A major gap in the literature is the relative lack of popu-
lation-based data on DR in Chinese people, the largest ethnic
group in the world, constituting approximately 20% of the
global population. Data on epidemiology of DR in ethnic Chi-
nese populations living in China and among those who have
migrated to other countries are limited. Some of the ques-
tions that are unanswered include: is the prevalence of DR in
Chinesepeoplewhohaveimmigratedoverseashigherthanthat
of Chinese people living in China? Are the risk factors similar
ordifferent?Arethereuniquecharacteristics(eg,language,cul-
ture,accesstohealthcare,orbehavioralhabits)thatallownovel
approaches to prevent vision loss?
SomeofthesequestionsareaddressedinthisissueofJAMA
Ophthalmology. The Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) ex-
amined the prevalence and characteristics of DR among Chi-
nese American individuals residing in California.5 This large
population-based study on Chinese American individuals pro-
vides the first robust data on the epidemiology of DR in one
of the fastest-growing immigrant groups in the United States.
