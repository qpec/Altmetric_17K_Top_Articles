Abstract
On-demand relief of local pain would allow patients to control the timing, intensity and duration 
of nerve block in a safe and non-invasive manner. Ultrasound would be a suitable trigger for such a 
system, as it is in common clinical use and can penetrate deeply into the body. Here, we 
demonstrate that ultrasound-triggered delivery of an anaesthetic from liposomes allows the timing, 
intensity and duration of nerve block to be controlled by ultrasound parameters. On insonation, the 
encapsulated sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX produces reactive oxygen species that react with 
the liposomal membrane, leading to the release of the potent local anaesthetic tetrodotoxin. We 
also show repeatable ultrasound-triggered nerve blocks in vivo, with nerve-block duration 
depending on the extent and intensity of insonation. We did not detect any systemic toxicity, and

 tissue reaction was benign in all groups. On-demand, personalized local anaesthesia could be 
beneficial for the managing of relatively localized pain states, and potentially minimize opioid use.
Introduction
Current treatments of perioperative and other forms of relative acute pain are limited, relying 
heavily on opioids and local anesthetics. Opioids are a mainstay of pain treatments, but are 
systemic therapies associated with clouding of the sensorium and the potential for tolerance, 
addiction, diversion, and overdose. Local anesthetics are effective in perioperative and other 
forms of acute pain, and can be applied throughout a tissue (infiltration local anesthesia), or 
around a specific nerve or group of nerves (regional anesthesia); in the latter case, they can 
be effective even when applied at a distance from the injured area or surgical site. However, 
free local anesthetic solutions tend to be relatively brief in duration. Formulations have been 
developed that provide approximately one week of nerve block following a single 
administration1, 2. However, drug release from such systems cannot be adjusted in response 
to changes in the patient’s needs. Safe and on-demand local pain relief that allows patients to 
control the timing, intensity and duration of analgesia according to their changing needs and 
conditions would have a marked impact on the management of acute pain, and could reduce 
or obviate the use of opioids.
Remotely-triggered drug delivery systems have been developed that can address the need to 
modulate pharmacological effects in real time. We have developed injectable on-demand 
local anesthetic systems3, 4 that can be triggered by near-infrared light. The difficulty with 
light as a trigger is that its penetration of tissue may be limited5; that limitation may be 
overcome by increasing the irradiance, but at the risk of causing burns6, 7.
Ultrasound is non-invasive, can penetrate deep into tissues and it can be applied in a focused 
manner such that the energy applied in surrounding, non-targeted tissues can be 
minimized8, 9. Ultrasound is already common in clinical practice, for both diagnostic and 
therapeutic purposes. Nerve block injections are widely guided by ultrasound in the clinic, 
with an associated reduction in injection-related complications10 and an increase in success 
rate11. An on-demand nerve block system that could use readily available ultrasound clinical 
devices might ease clinical translation of on-demand drug delivery systems in pain 
management.
Many of the current ultrasound-triggerable drug delivery systems, such as micelles12, 
liposomes13, composites14 and hybrid15 materials, are responsive to the thermal and 
mechanical effects of ultrasound waves. Ultrasound can also induce sonochemistry, the use 
of ultrasound to carry out chemical reactions16. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has been 
proposed as an analogous strategy to photodynamic therapy (PDT), in which a 
sonosensitizer is activated by acoustic energy to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS)8. 
However, the generation of ROS by this effect remains largely unexplored for triggering the 
release of drugs17.
Here we developed a liposome-based system to provide ultrasound-triggered repeatable on-
demand local anesthesia (Scheme S1). Ultrasound energy encountering the liposomes will

 cause a sonosensitizer to release ROS, peroxidating unsaturated lipids in the bilayers, 
leading to release of local anesthetics which would induce nerve block. As the 
sonosensitizer18, we selected protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), a naturally- occurring intermediate 
of heme biosynthesis19 and the active component of the FDA-approved pro-drug 5-
aminolevulinic acid (ALA)20. The hydrophilic site 1 sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin 
(TTX), was chosen as the encapsulated local anesthetic due to its ultra-high potency and 
minimal myo-21 and neuro22-toxicity. Clinical trials of systemic TTX for cancer pain 
demonstrated the potential safety of this drug23, 24.
Results
Liposome preparation and in vitro evaluation
PPIX was encapsulated in liposomes consisting of unsaturated lipid (1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine; DLPC), saturated lipid (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphocholine; DSPC), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylglycerol (DSPG), and 
cholesterol. The mean size was 3.1 ± 0.9 µm (Figure S1). Ultrasound application did not 
induce statistically significant changes in liposome size (p=0.95, N=4), (Figure S1).
ROS production under insonation was measured by a fluorescent indicator, Carboxy-
H2DCFDA. Carboxy-H2DCFDA was added in the liposome solution and the production of 
ROS upon insonation was measured (Figure 1a); maximal ROS production occurred at a 
PPIX loading of 0.3% [mg PPIX/mg (PPIX+lipid) × 100 %]. This ROS production was 
associated with lipid peroxidation; the extent of peroxidation (see Methods) increased with 
increasing duration of insonation (Figure 1b). The effect of PPIX loading on ultrasound 
triggerability of drug release was evaluated in liposomes encapsulating the fluorescent dye 
sulforhodamine B (Lipo-PPIX-SRho; Figure 1) as reported4, 25. Sulforhodamine B (SRho) 
was loaded into liposomes by hydrating the liposomal lipid cake with a highly concentrated 
SRho aqueous solution, due to the hydrophilicity of SRho. The dye was encapsulated at a 
concentration where self-quenching resulted in low fluorescence; once SRho was released, 
its fluorescence increased, which was measured to determine SRho release. The greatest dye 
release under ultrasound application (3W/cm2, continuous application, 1 MHz, 10 min) 
occurred at 0.3 % loading (Figure 1c). In liposomes made with DSPC which is a saturated 
lipid, instead of the unsaturated and peroxidizable DLPC, dye release from insonation was 
greatly reduced (Figure 1c, DPLC negative group). Consequently, 0.3 % PPIX was used in 
all subsequent experiments.
The release of dye from Lipo-PPIX-SRho was dependent on the frequency, duration, 
intensity and duty cycle of insonation (Figure 1d–f). Based on these results, an ultrasound 
frequency of 1 MHz, intensity of 3 W/cm2, and 100% duty cycle were used for subsequent 
experiments in this study unless otherwise stated. Two durations of insonation were used: 10 
min to examine the effect of a single pulse on cargo release, and 5 min when assessing the 
effects of repeated pulses. (The shorter duration resulted in less release and therefore 
allowed more triggered events.) Dye release could be repeatedly triggered from liposomes 
by repeated insonation (3W/cm2, 1 MHz, 5 min; Figure 2a), with up to 4 triggerable events 
releasing 4.3 ± 0.8%, 4.5 ± 0.9%, 8.2 ± 2%, and 6.0 ± 0.9% respectively.

 To demonstrate that generation of ROS was the likely mechanism of triggered release, we 
irradiated Lipo-PPIX-SRho (PPIX 0.9 µg/mL, see Methods for details) with 400 nm light, 
which can cause PPIX to generate reactive oxygen species26. Lipo-PPIX-SRho irradiated at 
5 mW/cm2 for 10 min released 9.3% ± 1.8% of their dye payload (Figure S2). Lipo-SRho 
irradiated under the same conditions released very little dye (Figure S2).
The mechanical properties of blank liposomes (Lipo) and liposomes loaded with PPIX 
(Lipo-PPIX) were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Liposomes were 
immobilized on a 3-triethoxysilylpropylamine-functionalized Si wafer and their elastic 
moduli were measured (see Methods for details). The mean elastic modulus of Lipo was 
20.3 ± 6.2 kPa, and that of Lipo-PPIX was 217.3 ± 71.1 kPa (P value comparing the two = 
0.00079). These results demonstrate that the addition of PPIX to the liposomal formulation 
increased the elastic modulus of the liposomal bilayers, i.e. made them less susceptible to 
mechanical effects of insonation. These results suggest that the release of TTX from Lipo-
PPIX is more likely to have been attributable to ultrasound-induced sonochemistry than to 
the mechanical effects of ultrasound.
The dye-filled liposomes were injected subcutaneously to screen whether the ultrasound-
triggered response would function in vivo. Subcutaneous application (e.g. for infiltration 
anesthesia) is only one of many sites at which this system could be used to provide local 
anesthesia. Ultrasound-triggered release of dye from subcutaneously injected Lipo-PPIX-
SRho was demonstrated in vivo with an animal fluorescence imaging system (Figure 2b). 
Upon insonation (3W/cm2, 1 MHz, 10 min), the fluorescence in the injection area increased 
by 56 ± 9% (N=4; P < 0.001).
Ultrasound-triggered TTX release in vitro
TTX was encapsulated in PPIX-loaded liposomes (Lipo-PPIX-TTX; Figure 3a) with a mean 
size of 2.8 ± 0.5 µm. The loading efficiencies of TTX and PPIX were 22.2 ±0.2 % and 79.1 
±8.5 % respectively (Table S1), comparable to results from previous studies of TTX loaded 
liposomes3.
To confirm that TTX release was also triggerable from PPIX-loaded liposomes, in vitro TTX 
release was assessed by dialyzing 150 µL of Lipo-PPIX-TTX against 14 mL of PBS (Figure 
3b–c). 7.1 ±1.0 % of TTX was released within the first 4 h, followed by a slower release of 
approximately 0.4 %/h (Figure 3b). Ultrasound (3W/cm2, 1 MHz, 10 min) applied at the 5 h 
time point induced a release of 5.4 ± 2.6 % of TTX over the next 4 h (Figure 3b). Without 
ultrasound 1.4 ± 1.0 % was released over the same period. Liposomes loaded with TTX but 
without PPIX (Lipo-TTX) showed comparable TTX loading to Lipo-PPIX-TTX (Table S1), 
but TTX release was faster in the absence of PPIX: initial release was 19.6 ± 5.7 % in the 
first 4 h, after which release leveled off (Figure 3c). Ultrasound applied to Lipo-TTX at the 5 
h time point did not trigger TTX release. Comparing the release profile of Lipo-PPIX-TTX 
and Lipo-TTX, we find that in the first hour, release from Lipo-TTX (Figure 3c) was more 
than twice that from Lipo-PPIX-TTX (p = 0.02; Figure 3b); by 2 h the difference was almost 
three-fold (p < 0.01). These results show that PPIX was necessary for ultrasound-triggered 
TTX release.

 Lipo-PPIX-TTX and Lipo-TTX (TTX liposomes without PPIX) were insonated, and TTX 
was extracted as described42 and quantified by ELISA. Insonation, and the resulting 
production of ROS, did not affect the concentration of TTX in Lipo-PPIX-TTX (Figure S3).
Ultrasound-triggered sciatic nerve blockade in vivo
Liposomes were injected at the rat sciatic nerve, and nerve blockade was assessed by 
neurobehavioral testing with a modified hot-plate test (see Methods section). In these 
experiments, the principal metric of nerve block was the thermal latency (the length of time 
a rat would leave its hindpaw on a hotplate; 2 s was baseline and 12 s was maximal nerve 
block). In general, block was considered successful if latency was > 7 s. Duration of nerve 
block was defined as the time for thermal latency to return to 7 s, the mid-point between 
baseline and maximal block.
Lipo-PPIX-TTX induced an initial nerve block lasting 8.3 ± 4.7 h (N = 4; Table S2, Figure 
4a). Insonation (3W/cm2, 1 MHz, 10 min) after the thermal latency returned below 4 s 
resulted in a return of nerve block for 0.7 ± 0.2 h. A second application of ultrasound, 
applied after the thermal latency returned to ≤ 4 s again, caused a return of nerve block with 
a duration of 0.2 ± 0.2 h (Figure 4a). No nerve block was observed after a third ultrasound 
application. There was no animal mortality or increase in latency in the non-injected 
extremity (an established metric of systemic toxicity27). However, 50% of animals injected 
with Lipo-TTX (3 of 6) died 3–10 h after injection, and 4 out of 6 rats showed an increase in 
latency in the non-injected extremity, possibly a reflection of the more rapid TTX release in 
this group (Fig. 3c). In the 3 animals that survived (Figure 4b), Lipo-TTX induced an initial 
nerve block of 17.2 ± 11.3 h, but insonation after the thermal latency returned below 4 s did 
not induce renewed nerve block (Figure 4b, P = 0.001 between nerve block duration of Lipo-
PPIX-TTX and Lipo-TTX after insonation) or dye release (Figure S4), demonstrating that 
PPIX was necessary for insonation-induced nerve block and cargo release.
To assess the possibility that a formulation component other than TTX was causing nerve 
block, rats were injected at the sciatic nerve with PPIX-loaded liposomes without TTX 
(Lipo-PPIX, Figure S5). Initial injection did not induce nerve block, nor did insonation 8 h 
after injection, demonstrating that TTX was necessary for nerve block. Animals directly 
treated with ultrasound in the absence of formulation administration did not develop nerve 
block upon insonation (Figure S6).
To further demonstrate that the triggerablity of the Lipo-PPIX-TTX was due to ultrasound 
causing liposome lipid peroxidation, and not due to other effects of ultrasound, we injected 
rats at the sciatic nerve with TTX-containing liposomes (Lipo-DSPC-TTX) that did not 
contain PPIX or DLPC (which was replaced by DSPC, which cannot be peroxidated) and 
therefore could not be triggered in vitro (Figure S7a). Lipo-DSPC-TTX caused an initial 
nerve block of 6.1 ± 3.6 h, which was comparable to the duration of initial block from Lipo-
PPIX-TTX, but insonation did not induce nerve block (Figure S7).
To further enhance the number and duration of ultrasound-triggerable nerve blocks, we co-
administered dexmedetomidine-loaded liposomes (Lipo-DMED, see Figure S8 for cryo-
TEM image, see Methods for synthesis) with Lipo-PPIX-TTX at a 1:2 (Lipo-DMED: Lipo-

 PPIX-TTX) mass ratio. Dexmedetomidine, an α2-adrenergic agonists, prolongs the local 
anesthetic effects of TTX28 Lipo-PPIX-TTX + Lipo-DMED caused an initial nerve block of 
34.5 ± 5.0 h (Figure 5, Table S2). Repeated insonation (3 W/cm2, 1 MHz, 10 min) after the 
return to ≤ 4 s latency triggered three separate consecutive nerve blocks with durations of 1.8 
± 1.2 h, 0.9 ± 0.3 h, and 0.5 ± 0.3 h respectively (Figure 5a, Table S2). The fourth ultrasound 
application induced an increase in hind-paw thermal latency to a mean of 5.3 ± 1.6 s. These 
results demonstrate that the co-administration of Lipo-DMED and Lipo-PPIX-TTX 
enhanced the repeatability and duration of nerve block compared to Lipo-PPIX-TTX alone. 
Administration of free TTX and DMED caused an initial nerve block of 9.27 ± 2.86 h. 
Insonation after thermal latency returned to 4 s did not cause an increase in thermal latency 
(Figure S9). This results demonstrate that that the residual free drug was not sufficient to 
induce nerve block upon insonation. A corollary to that is that ultrasound was not able to 
change the effect of the drugs so as to achieve nerve block.
The intensity and duration of the ultrasound-triggered nerve blocks could be controlled by 
varying the intensity and duration of the applied insonation after the initial nerve block from 
the administration of Lipo-DMED + Lipo-PPIX-TTX wore off (Figure 5b–d, Table S3). 
Insonation pulses of 2, 5, and 10 -min induced nerve blocks with a mean duration of 0.2 
± 0.2 h, 0.5 ± 0.2 h and 2.3 ± 0.9 h respectively (Figure 5b). Up to five separate consecutive 
ultrasound-triggerable nerve blocks were achieved by 5-min insonation (Table S3). The 
mean peak thermal latency was 12 s for 10-min insonations, 9.9 ± 2.5 s for 5-min 
insonations, and 7.3 ± 1.4 s for 2-min insonations. The survival rate for all rats injected with 
Lipo-PPIX-TTX (with and without Lipo-DMED; 20 animals in total) was 100%, and no 
increase in contralateral latency was observed, suggesting no clinically significant systemic 
distribution of TTX. The duration of the ultrasound-triggered nerve block increased with 
increasing duration of insonation, with a plateau at 10 min (Figure 5c).
To examine the effect of insonation intensity on ultrasound-triggered nerve block, 
insonations of different ultrasound intensities (10 min, 1–3W/cm2) were applied after the 
initial nerve block wore off (Figure 5d). The intensity and duration of nerve block increased 
with the intensity of insonation (Figure 5d, Table S4). No effective nerve block occurred 
below insonation intensities of approximately 1 W/cm2, above which duration of nerve 
block increased with ultrasound intensity.
Tissue reaction
In all animals that underwent neurobehavioral testing, the sciatic nerve and surrounding 
tissues were collected 4 days after the last ultrasound application. Animals administered 
PPIX-loaded liposomes had reddish-brown (the color of PPIX) liposome deposits 
surrounding the sciatic nerve (Figure S10), demonstrating accurate liposome injection at the 
target site. Collected tissues were processed into hematoxylin & eosin-stained slides. All 
animals injected with liposomes showed mild inflammation at the injection site consistent 
with previous reports of perineural microparticle injection29, but minimal inflammation was 
seen in the adjacent muscle. Foamy macrophages were observed at the injection site, 
showing particle uptake (Figure S11). All slides were scored for inflammation (0–4) and 
myotoxicity (0–6; see details in Methods). All groups had median inflammation scores of 1

 (Figure S11, detailed scores in Table S5). The median myotoxicity score was 0 in all groups 
(Figure S11, Table S5). Insonation itself (in the absence of liposome administration) caused 
no significant inflammation (P=0.4 compared with normal tissue), myotoxicity (P=0.4 
compared with normal tissue), or signs of other tissue injury (Figure S12) 1h after 
application. These data indicated that the ultrasound conditions used in this work do not 
induce tissue injury, immediately after the application, nor in the following four days.
Sciatic nerves were stained with toluidine blue and sectioned. No significant neurotoxicity 
was observed in any animals (Figure S13).
Ultrasound-guided injection and sonography of liposomes
Ultrasound-guidance has become a standard of practice for peripheral nerve blockade30. It 
would be advantageous if ultrasound could be used both for procedural imaging and 
subsequent triggering. We assessed whether Lipo-PPIX could be visualized by ultrasound 
(Figure 6). PPIX-loaded liposomes (Lipo-PPIX) were placed within ultrasonic gel in vitro 
and were imaged with high frequency ultrasound (40 MHz, ISPTA < 0.08 W/cm2). The 
liposome layer was densely echogenic while the same volume of water was not (Figure 6a). 
Under the same experimental conditions, the echogenicity of Lipo was similar to that of 
(Figure S14) Lipo-PPIX. To show that Lipo-PPIX could be imaged at clinical imaging 
frequencies (2–20 MHz), Lipo-PPIX was successfully imaged with a 20 MHz transducer 
(Figure S16).
In anesthetized animals, the sciatic nerve was identified under sonography at a tissue depth 
of approximately 7 mm (Figure S15, Figure 6b). A 23G needle was then advanced beside 
the sciatic nerve, and Lipo-PPIX was injected. A bright liposome deposit was observed on 
the sonogram after injection (Figure 6b), showing successful injection and imaging of 
liposomes at the target site.
Discussion
On-demand local anesthesia would allow patients to control the timing, duration and 
intensity of pain relief at will, ideally with a safe and non-invasive triggering system. Here 
we demonstrated that ultrasound allowed on-demand local anesthesia and that the intensity 
and duration of local anesthesia could be controlled by adjusting the intensity and duration 
of insonation (Figures 4–5). The system described here with TTX and DMED would provide 
about 36 hours of continuous initial nerve block, a duration very suitable for many 
perioperative contexts. It would then allow an additional half-day of on-demand nerve 
blockade, allowing personalized narcotic-free pain management. It is possible that such 
systems would mitigate the need for opioid prescription. Further developments of this proof-
of-principle system could be designed to provide a shorter or longer initial nerve block, or a 
greater number of triggerable events, depending on the clinical context and anatomical site.
As ultrasound is commonly used in the clinics, and hand-held therapeutic ultrasound devices 
are commercially available, controlling pain relief by adjusting the duration of ultrasound 
provides a simple method for on-demand local anesthesia. Ultrasound has been used safely 
for therapy at tissue depths of 2.3 to 5 cm31. The device used in this study was a commercial

 ultrasound employed in physiotherapy under conditions approved for clinical use. No tissue 
injury was seen.
Ultrasound is a versatile energy source since it would allow image-guided injection, 
identification of the injectate in situ, confirmation of the appropriate site, and triggering of 
drug release. One could envision the use of a single ultrasound device by the clinician for 
pain treatments: using a diagnostic ultrasound setup (higher frequency, lower power) during 
injection, followed by formulation imaging, then using a therapeutic setup (lower frequency, 
higher power) to trigger further anesthetic events post-injection.
The hypothesis that sonochemistry and the production of ROS played a major role in 
ultrasound-triggered cargo release is supported by the observation that liposomes loaded 
with PPIX produced a higher amount of ROS compared with blank liposomes (Figure 1), 
and that the incorporation of PPIX was necessary for triggered release of cargo (Figure 1, 
Figure 3, Figure 4). Production of ROS upon insonation in the presence of sonosensitizers 
could be due to several mechanisms.32, 33 Ultrasound-induced cavitation can produce light 
(sonoluminescence)32, which could then activate the photosensitizer PPIX to produce ROS. 
Implosion of ultrasound-induced cavitation bubbles can also induce the formation of 
sonosensitizer-derived free radicals which generate ROS34. All these effects are dependent 
on inertial cavitation upon insonation33, which could be induced by the ultrasound 
conditions used here (3W/cm2, 1 MHz, continuous wave)35.
Another possible mechanism of the ultrasound-triggered cargo release may have been the 
mechanical effect of ultrasound. Liposome disruption by mechanical effects of ultrasound is 
known to be more efficient at frequencies much lower than those used in this study36–38. In 
this study, we found that PPIX-loaded liposomes (Lipo-PPIX) were more mechanically 
stable (higher elastic modulus) than liposomes without PPIX (Lipo). This is in agreement 
with previous studies, where the incorporation of photosensitizers reduced the fluidity 
(raised the elastic modulus) of lipid membranes39 perhaps by enhancing hydrophobic 
interactions in the lipid bilayer, thereby stabilizing the liposomes25. The higher mechanical 
stability of PPIX-loaded liposomes would make them more difficult to be activated by 
ultrasound-induced mechanical effects. These data suggest that sonochemical effects, not 
mechanical effects, may have been the major mechanism of ultrasound-triggered release of 
TTX.
The difference in elastic modulus between Lipo and Lipo-PPIX may also explain their 
release kinetics shown in Figure 3b and 3c. Decreasing in the fluidity of the lipid bilayer 
would decrease the rate of cargo release1. This is consistent with our observation in Figure 
3, where Lipo was found to release its cargo more rapidly than Lipo-PPIX due to the higher 
fluidity of its lipid bilayers.
The ultrasound triggerability of PPIX-loaded liposomes increased with PPIX loading at low 
PPIX concentrations, then decreased above a loading capacity of 0.3 % (Figure 1). This 
observation is consistent with previous reports25, where it was attributed to an increase in 
liposomal stability due to the hydrophobicity of the PPIX included in the lipid bilayer. It is 
also possible that above a certain concentration of PPIX, there is a self-quenching effect that

 diminishes the efficacy of PPIX in ROS generation (as has been described for aluminum and 
zinc phthalocyanines40, 41). The formulation that produced the highest amount of ROS was 
the same formulation that had the highest ultrasound-triggered dye release. These results 
indicate that the decrease in ultrasound triggerability of formulations with PPIX loadings 
higher than the optimal PPIX loading may be due to the increase in PPIX-induced liposomal 
bilayer stability and the decrease in ROS generation of the formulation due to the self-
quenching effect of sonosensitizers.
TTX and other compounds42 that block the sodium channel at a site (site 1) different from 
that for conventional local anesthetics, have generally been used as scientific tools. However, 
their potent local anesthetic properties have long been recognized43, particularly if their 
systemic toxicity can be curtailed with other drugs27 or sustained release1. Recently, site 1 
sodium channel blockers, including TTX and neosaxitoxin, have undergone clinical trials – 
the latter for peripheral nerve blockade44, 45.
Particles containing local anesthetics – including those described here – generally serve as a 
depot, with drugs diffusing from the site of injection to adjacent nerves46. The present 
system could be applied in the same general set of applications as most local anesthetics: 
throughout the body, either injected throughout tissue planes (infiltration anesthesia) or 
along specific nerves or groups of nerves (regional anesthesia). In the latter applications, the 
particle depot is remote from the painful site; analgesia is provided by interruption of nerve 
signal proceeding to the brain.
We hypothesized that ultrasound-induced TTX release was the main mechanism of 
ultrasound-triggered nerve block. Modulation of peripheral nerve activity by ultrasound 
(“neuromodulation”)47 was another potential contributing factor. In our experiments, 
insonation of animals injected with PPIX-loaded liposomes without TTX did not induce an 
increase in thermal latency (Figure S5), nor did insonation of uninjected animals (Figure 
S6). These experiments suggest that ultrasound itself did not cause nerve block in the 
absence of TTX. Ultrasound did not cause nerve block after recovery of analgesia from TTX 
+ DMED solution (Figure S9) although it did after recovery from Lipo-PPIX-TTX + Lipo-
DMED – indicating that the return of nerve block after insonation of Lipo-PPIX-TTX + 
Lipo-DMED was due to the release of TTX from the liposomes. Moreover, if the return of 
nerve block were due to a direct effect of ultrasound on free TTX or on nerve, one would 
have expected the return to occur in both cases since the local concentrations of TTX would 
be equal, nerve block having just worn off. We cannot exclude the possibility that ultrasound 
could affect nerve block, only that it did not do so here.
The eventual lack of effect after multiple triggering of PPIX-loaded liposomes in vitro could 
be attributable to a number of factors. The ultrasound-triggered peroxidation is irreversible, 
limiting the number of triggerable (peroxidation-dependent) events. Another potential 
contributing factor is the depletion of drug remaining in the liposomal reservoir due to basal 
release and repeated triggers. In vivo, it is possible that degradation and/or removal of 
particles could also play a role.

 We sought to improve the performance of the system by increasing the effect of each packet 
of TTX released. We did so by co-delivering dexmedetomidine (DMED), an α2-adrenergic 
agonist that prolongs the therapeutic effects of local anesthetics28, 48, 49. Since the DMED 
was contained in separate liposomes than the TTX, the effect of DMED was likely a 
pharmacological one rather than due to increased TTX release. DMED increased the 
duration of the initial nerve block, as well as the duration and number of triggered nerve 
blocks. (Figure 4–5, Table S2). One potential mechanism of such synergy by DMED’s 
inhibition of hyperpolarization-activated cation current48. Another contributing factor is 
local α2-adrenergic receptor mediated vasoconstriction49, 50, which inhibits redistribution of 
the local anesthetic, maintaining a high local concentration at the target tissue.
Many local anesthetic drug delivery systems continue to release drug after the local effect 
has ended58, 59. The resulting period of subclinical anesthetic release can be very useful: co-
delivery of drugs that potentiate the effect of the anesthetic can render the subclinical 
concentration effective1, 60, 61. This was seen here in the marked prolongation of initial 
block due to the addition of DMED to the formulation. All released drug will eventually 
enter the systemic circulation and be eliminated, renally in the case of TTX62. Of note, the 
second drug can also be beneficial in mitigating local toxicity of TTX, particularly if it is a 
local vasoconstrictor, as are α2-adrenergics agonists63 such as DMED.
The mild inflammation from liposomes injections is generally considered safe5152, and we 
saw no significant tissue toxicity from the liposomes or insonation (the ultrasound 
parameters used in this study are used for therapeutic ultrasound53). TTX has also been 
shown to have minimal myo- and neuro-toxicity21, 22. PPIX is the active agent of FDA 
approved drug ALA54. The main ROS that are involved in sonosensitization are hydroxyl 
radicals and singlet oxygen. The former has a half-life of 10−9 s and diffusion distance of 
0.06 nm55, 56, the latter has a half-life of 10−6 s and diffusion distance of 268 nm57. These 
distances are small compared to the length scales of tissue, suggesting a low likelihood of 
toxicity, consistent with the results of this study.
Sustained release local anesthetic systems act by continuously releasing doses high enough 
to be effective over an extended period. Consequently those that can achieve very long 
durations of effect commonly contain substantial quantities of drug1, 60. The sustained 
release also prevents systemic toxicity; the fact that the drug payload is contained in a vast 
number of separate particulate compartments is one safeguard against catastrophic dumping 
of drug with resulting toxicity. Another important safety consideration in translating such 
systems into humans lies in the difference in size between humans and rats. The dose 
required for a given local anesthetic endpoint tracks weakly with animal size64. In contrast, 
local anesthetic toxicity tracks fairly linearly with animal size, in proportion to the increased 
volume of distribution. Therefore the therapeutic index would be expected to increase in 
larger animals. This was seen in humans who were able to achieve safe prolonged local 
anesthesia with neosaxitoxin, a compound that acts by a mechanism similar to that of 
tetrodotoxin45, 65, 66. The doses used in those humans would have been uniformly fatal in 
rats.

 Finally, liposomes may have intrinsic echogenic properties that are dependent on their lipid 
composition, concentration and vesicle structure. Oligo- and multilamellar liposomes, like 
the ones used in this study, are more echogenic than unilamellar liposomes67, providing the 
ability to image them via ultrasound. Here, 40 MHz was used to provide higher resolution 
imaging to better target the rat sciatic nerve, which is much smaller than that of humans. 
This imaging frequency is often used in small animal imaging68. In the clinic, ultrasound 
frequencies of 2 – 20 MHz are used for sonography. Our liposomes can be imaged at those 
frequencies (Figure S16).
We have developed an ultrasound-triggerable, on-demand nerve block system that allows 
effective control of nerve block duration and intensity simply through the duration and 
intensity of insonation. Diagnostic ultrasound allowed guided injection and imaging of the 
formulation, whereas therapeutic ultrasound induced adjustable and repeatable nerve block.
Methods
Liposome preparation
Liposomes were prepared by the thin-film hydration method, as reported3. In brief, the lipid 
formulation [DSPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA), DLPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, 
Alabaster, AL, USA), DSPG (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA), and cholesterol (Sigma, St. 
Louis, MO, USA) at molar ratio 3:3:2:3], along with the indicated amount of the 
sonosensitizer PPIX, was dissolved in a solution of chloroform:methanol 9:1. The solvent 
was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the lipid was redissolved in t-butanol, followed 
by freeze-drying. The lipid cake was hydrated with PBS, TTX solution (0.375 mg/mL PBS; 
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), or sulforhodamine B solution (10 mg/mL PBS; Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MO, USA). After 10 freeze–thaw cycles, the solution was dialyzed against PBS for 
48 h in a dialysis tube with a molecular mass cut-off of 1000 kDa. The dialysis media were 
changed with fresh PBS at least twice a day. Lipo-DMED was made following the same 
procedure, but with PPIX not included in the formulation and with hydration in 1 mg/mL of 
DMED in PBS solution.
Liposome characterization
Liposome size was determined with a Beckman Coulter Multisizer 3 (Beckman Coulter, 
Indianapolis, IN, USA). Liposomal sulforhodamine B content was determined by UV-Vis 
absorption (λmax = 565 nm) after disrupting the liposomes with octyl β-D-glucopyranoside 
(OGP) (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA)3. Liposomal PPIX content was determined 
by UV-Vis absorption at 402 nm after disrupting the liposomes in ethanol69. Liposomal TTX 
content was determined by ELISA (Reagen, Moorestown, NJ, USA) after removing the lipid 
fraction using the Bligh and Dyer method70.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection
Carboxy-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes, OR, USA), is a non-fluorescent reagent 
commercially available for the detection of ROS71, 72. Upon exposure to ROS, it undergoes 
oxidation and forms the the highly fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), which can be 
detected upon fluorescence measurements (Scheme S2). Carboxy-H2DCFDA was dissolved

 in ethanol and diluted 100 fold in PBS, followed by the addition to liposome suspension to a 
final concentration of 10 µM. The fluorescence emission at 527 nm (excitation: 493 nm) was 
monitored after applying ultrasound to 1 mL of the solution at 3 W/cm2 for 10 min.
Lipid peroxidation
To determine the degree of lipid peroxidation in the system, we followed a reported Fe-
based colorimetric method73. Briefly, 0.9 mL of a methanolic solution of xylenol orange 
(100 µM), Fe2+ (250 µM), H2S04 (25 mM) and butylated hydroxytoluene (4 mM) were 
incubated with 100 µL of sample for 30 min at room temperature. The absorbance at 560 nm 
was measured.
In vitro release of fluorescent dye
Self-quenching sulforhodamine B was used as a hydrophilic model dye3. To measure 
ultrasound or 400 nm light-triggered release, sulforhodamine B liposomes were diluted 200-
fold in PBS. For ultrasound triggered experiments, 1 mL of the suspension was placed in a 
20-mL glass vial and sealed with a latex membrane. Ultrasonic gel was then placed between 
the latex membrane and the ultrasonic source. Ultrasound was applied at the reported power 
and duration. For light-triggered experiments, the diluted liposome solution was directed 
exposed under a 400-nm light source for 10 min, 5 mW/cm2. The fluorescent intensity 
(excitation/emission: 560/580 nm) was recorded. The release of dye from liposomes upon 
ultrasound or light exposure was quantified according to the following equation3:
F = Fluorescence of solution upon ultrasound exposure F0 = Fluorescence of liposome 
solution prior to ultrasound exposure Fbreak = Fluorescence of surfactant (octyl β-D-
glucopyranoside)-disrupted liposome solution.
Atomic force microscopy
Silicon wafer (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA, USA) was functionalized by 3-
Triethoxysilylpropylamine (APTES, Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using a 
previously reported method74. Liposomes were placed onto the wafer and left settled for 1 h 
under room temperature. The DNP-10 AFM tip (Bruker Nano Inc., Camarillo, CA, USA) 
was used. The AFM machine model was MFP-3D Bio (Asylum Research, Goleta, CA, 
USA). Force curves were measured and analyzed by the computational program Igor Pro 
(Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA). The Hertzian model was applied to obtain the 
elastic moduli as previously reported75.
In vivo imaging with dye-loaded liposomes (Lipo-PPIX-SRho)
Lipo-PPIX-SRho (150µL) was injected subcutaneously and the fluorescence intensity of the 
released fluorophore was detected and quantified using an in vivo imaging system4 (IVIS 
spectrum, Caliper Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) before and after ultrasound

 application (3W/cm2, 10 min, 1 MHz), at excitation and emission wavelengths of 535 nm 
and 580 nm.
In vitro TTX release
TTX release experiments were performed by placing 150 µL of TTX-loaded liposomes into 
a Slide-A-Lyzer MINI dialysis device (Thermo Scientific, Tewksbury, MA, USA) with a 
20,000 MW cut-off. The sample was dialyzed against 14 mL PBS and incubated at 37°C on 
a platform shaker at 150 rpm (New Brunswick Innova 40, Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, 
USA)3. At predetermined intervals, the dialysis solution was exchanged with fresh PBS. To 
measure the ultrasound-triggerability of the liposomes, ultrasound was applied (3 W/cm2, 1 
MHz) for 10 min at the 5-h time point. TTX concentration was determined by ELISA 
(Reagen LLC, Moorestown, NJ, USA).
Animal Studies
Animal studies were performed according to protocols approved by the Boston Children’s 
Hospital Animal Care and Use Committee following the guidelines of the International 
Association for the Study of Pain76. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (Charles River 
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing 300–400 g were housed in groups under a 
12-h/12-h light/dark cycle with lights on at 7:00 AM. Animals were randomly assigned to 
each group. Under brief isoflurane-oxygen anesthesia, the animals were injected with 200 
µL of liposomes with or without 100 µL of Lipo-DMED, using a 23G needle. The injection 
was performed at the sciatic nerve as described3 with the needle introduced posteromedial to 
the greater trochanter, then the animals underwent neurobehavioral testing (see following 
paragraph) at predetermined intervals. Once the initial nerve block wore off, animals were 
exposed to ultrasound (New Pocket Sonovit, New Age Italia Srl, Lugo, RA, Italy) under 
brief anesthesia, at the time points and durations described in Results. The process was 
repeated until there was no further nerve block. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed by 
injection SRho-loaded liposomes at a dosage of 1.5 mg/kg and constant volume of 200 µL. 
The blood was processed using a previously reported method77. In brief, at predetermined 
time points, blood was collected from the tail. After centrifugation, the supernatant was 
collected. Methanol was then added at a 1:1 vol ratio. Samples were settled overnight at 4°C. 
The supernatant was collected. The concentration of SRho was analyzed by fluorescence 
(excitation/emission: 560 /580 nm).
Sensory nerve block was examined at different time points by a modified hotplate test (hind-
paw thermal latency) as reported3, 78. The researcher who performed the neurobehavioral 
test was blinded to the sample group allocation. The rat’s hindpaw was placed on a 
preheated hot plate at 56 °C. The time until the animal withdrew its paw foot (the thermal 
latency) was recorded. Animals that did not retract the paw after 12 s were removed 
manually to prevent thermal injury. 2 s was considered baseline. Durations of sensory block 
were calculated as the time required for thermal latency to return to 7 s (the middle point 
between baseline and maximum possible thermal latency). Measurements were repeated 
three times at each time point, and the median was used for further data analysis.

 Histology
Rats were euthanized by carbon dioxide 4 d after the last ultrasound exposure. The sciatic 
nerve and surrounding tissue were harvested and underwent standard procedures to produce 
H&E-stained slides, following the same protocol as previously reported3. Inflammation and 
myotoxicity of the samples were scored as reported79. All scoring and other histological 
assessments were performed by an observer (A.Y.R.) blinded as to the nature of the 
individual samples. The inflammation score was a subjective quantification of severity in 
which 0 was normal and 4 was severe inflammation. The myotoxicity score was determined 
based on nuclear internalization and regeneration of myocytes, which are representative 
characteristics of local anesthetics’ myotoxicity. Nuclear internalization was characterized 
by myocytes having nuclei located away from their usual location at the periphery of the 
cell. Regeneration was characterized by the presence of shrunken myocytes with basophilic 
cytoplasm. The scoring scale was as follows: 0 = normal; 1 = perifascicular internalization; 
2 = deep internalization (more than five cell layers); 3 = perifascicular regeneration; 4 = 
deep tissue regeneration (more than five cell layers); 5 = hemifascicular regeneration; 6 = 
holofascicular regeneration.
Nerve tissue was processed with toluidine blue staining as previously reported3. In brief, the 
sciatic nerve tissues were fixed in Karnovsky’s KII Solution (2.5 % glutaraldehyde, 2.0 % 
paraformaldehyde, 0.025 % calcium chloride in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4), followed 
by postfixation with osmium tetroxide. Samples were then stained with uranyl acetate, 
dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, and infiltrated with propylene oxide/TAAB 812 
Resin (TAAB Laboratories, Aldermaston, Berks, United Kingdom) mixtures. Tissue sections 
were stained with toluidine blue.
Ultrasound imaging
The Visualsonics Vevo 2100 (VisualSonics Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) with an MS-550D 40 
MHz or an MS-250 20 MHz transducer at B-mode was used for sonography. In vitro 
imaging was achieved by applying 100 µL of liposome or water on top of a layer of 
ultrasonic gel, and covering it with another layer of gel. The top layer gel was in contact 
with the transducer.
Sprague–Dawley rats of 300 – 400 g were anesthetized with isoflurane-oxygen and 
positioned under the ultrasound transducer. Ultrasonic gel was applied between the 
transducer and the rat. A 23G needle was used to inject 200 µL of Lipo-PPIX. The needle 
was placed beside the sciatic nerve as shown from the real-time sonogram prior to liposome 
administration (Fig. S6).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical comparisons were performed using the Student t-test (one-sided) unless stated 
otherwise. The variance between the groups that were statistically compared was similar. 
Thermal latencies, inflammation and myotoxicity scores were reported by medians and 
quartiles due to its ordinal or non-Gaussian character. All other data were described by 
means and standard deviations.
