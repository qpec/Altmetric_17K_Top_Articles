Evolutionary pressures have made foraging behaviours highly efficient in
many species. Eye movements during search present a useful instance of
foraging behaviour in humans. We tested the efficiency of eye movements
during search using homogeneous and heterogeneous arrays of line seg-
ments. The search target is visible in the periphery on the homogeneous
array, but requires central vision to be detected on the heterogeneous
array. For a compound search array that is heterogeneous on one side and
homogeneous on the other, eye movements should be directed only to the
heterogeneous side. Instead, participants made many fixations on the homo-
geneous side. By comparing search of compound arrays to an estimate of
search performance based on uniform arrays, we isolate two contributions
to search inefficiency. First, participants make superfluous fixations, sacrifi-
cing speed for a perceived (but not actual) gain in response certainty.
Second, participants fixate the homogeneous side even more frequently
than predicted by inefficient search of uniform arrays, suggesting they also
fail to direct fixations to locations that yield the most new information.
1. Introduction
Imagine that you are searching for a red pen, and you know it could be on either of
two desks. The top of one desk is clean, while the other desk is cluttered with
papers, other pens, books and coffee cups. What is the most effective way to
find the red pen? Common sense suggests that a glance at the empty desk
should be enough to detect the target if it is present, and the observer should
spend the rest, or all, of their time searching the cluttered desk. An efficient
visual system would not waste any time on the clean desk.
Several models of efficient foraging behaviour (e.g. [1,2]) have been devel-
oped, against which actual foraging behaviour can be measured. In humans,
optimal models of search sample information efficiently by directing eye move-
ments to locations that yield the maximum possible information or reward
[3–5]. In their influential model of visual search, Najemnik & Geisler [6,7]
demonstrated that eye movements are well described by an optimal strategy,
in which each saccade during search is directed to the location that will maxi-
mize the probability of detecting a target. A few recent studies, however,
contradict key assumptions of the optimal search model. Notably, observers
appear to be unable to adapt their fixation strategies on a trial-by-trial basis
to changes in target frequency [8], or to changes in the expected difficulty of
detecting the target in the periphery [9–11].
Alternatives to optimal foraging have been proposed: for instance, selection
of eye movements during search have also been shown to be well described by
a stochastic process [12]. In the stochastic model, each eye movement during
search is randomly selected from the population of eye movement vectors
that tend to be executed from the region of the search array that is currently
fixated. The apparent contradiction with an optimal process can be resolved
by the possibility that a combination of experience and evolution has shaped
the population of eye movement vectors to produce relatively efficient search,

 without the need for complex calculations that must take into
account information that can be difficult to estimate under
most circumstances, such as expected target visibility across
the retina. Eye movements can thereby appear optimal, even
though the underlying process driving them is a far simpler
heuristic. Consistent with stochastic processes driving selec-
tion of eye movements, there is some evidence that eye
movements in reading follow a random walk [13], at least
partially [14]. However, models with a degree of guidance
in reading tend to be favoured (for a review, see [15,16]),
with an emphasis on the orthographic and phonetic features
that contribute to fixation selection processes.
In summary, the optimal and stochastic search models
present two very different, but similarly effective, ways of
explaining eye movements during search. To discriminate
between these two models, here we test a straightforward pre-
diction of an optimal search model: eye movements should be
directed to locations that yield the most information. When
faced with the search array depicted in figure 1, and instructed
to search for a line oriented 458 to the right, optimal observers
should only make fixations to the more heterogeneous half of
the array. If the target were on the more homogeneous side
of the array, it would be easily detected using peripheral
vision, making fixations to that side superfluous (details of a
pilot experiment checking the suitability of our stimuli are
given in the electronic supplementary materials). If search is
optimal, therefore, the proportion of fixations directed to the
heterogeneous side on any given trial should be 1, because
inspection of the homogeneous side will provide no additional
information about the target location.
In the first experiment, we find that most participants
over-fixate the homogeneous half of the display at the cost of
increased reaction times (RTs). There are two possible (non-
conflicting) explanations for this search inefficiency. First, it
could reflect a failure to direct fixations in a manner that maxi-
mizes information gain, which would present a direct challenge
to the optimal search model of Najemnik & Geisler [6]. Second,
participants may make unnecessary confirmatory fixations on
both sides of the display. To separate these two plausible contri-
butions to search inefficiency, we ran a second experiment
using a mix of uniform homogeneous, uniform heterogeneous
and compound arrays. Search in the compound display may
simply reflect an additive combination of how (in)efficiently
participants search uniform displays. To the extent that search
in compound displays is slower than predicted based on
performance in uniform displays, we can conclude a failure to
distribute fixations optimally across the two types of search
arrays also contributes to search inefficiency.
2. Material and methods
(a) Participants
Each experiment had 14 participants (28 total, with females ¼ 17;
age range ¼ 20–62; mean age ¼ 25.3). Previous seminal exper-
iments on this topic had a very small numbers of participants
(e.g. n ¼ 2 in [6]; n ¼ 4 in [9]) but report results from individuals
separately rather than averaging them. Our sample is larger, but
we maintain the approach of reporting individual differences (as
in [10]).
(b) Apparatus
The display was presented on a 17-inch CRT monitor with a
resolution of 1024 � 768. Stimulus generation, presentation and
data collection were controlled by MATLAB and psychophysics
toolbox [17,18] run on a Powermac. The position of the dominant
eye was recorded using a desktop-mounted EyeLink 1000 eye
tracker (SR Research, Canada) sampling eye position at 1000 Hz.
(c) Stimuli
The line segments were aligned in 22 columns and 16 rows on a
uniform grey background. The target line was always tilted 458
to the right. The mean distractor angle was perpendicular to the
target angle. Search difficulty was manipulated by sampling
from either a narrow 308 range of distractor line orientations
(homogeneous) or a wide 1068 range (heterogeneous). In a pilot
study reported in full in the electronic supplementary material,
we show that, when viewed while fixating screen centre, accuracy
to detect the target was close to ceiling for homogeneous distrac-
tors (96 (SD 5) for target present, 89 (SD 13) for target absent)
and close to chance for heterogeneous distractors (61 (SD 13) for
target present, 57 (SD 17) for target absent). In experiment 1, one
half of each search array consisted of line segments with a homo-
geneous orientation, while the other half was heterogeneous (e.g.
figure 1). Which side was heterogeneous was random on each
trial. There were 160 trials in total, half of which contained a
target. The side of the target relative to the search difficulty was
counterbalanced. The target could be located in any of the possible
locations apart from the middle four vertical columns.
Figure 1. Example of a compound search array. The target is a line oriented
458 to the right. The heterogeneous half of the array is shown on the left
side. Note that the target is present on both the heterogeneous and homo-
geneous side in this example to demonstrate how easy and hard the search
was on each side. The real arrays only contained one or zero targets.

 In experiment 2, the stimuli consisted of 80 homogeneous
arrays, 80 heterogeneous arrays and 80 compound arrays.
There were 240 trials in total, half of which contained a target.
All the stimuli were displayed until the participant made a
response (or timed out after 60 s).
(d) Procedure
On arrival at the laboratory each participant was asked to read
and sign a consent form, and was seated alone in a low-lit
room. Participants were told they would see line segments on
the screen, and their task was to determine whether a line
tilted 458 to the right was present among other lines. Participants
were asked to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
Each trial consisted of a black fixation point (letter x) subtending
1.5 � 2.5 cm (1.98 � 3.18), presented at the centre of the computer
screen. On the press of a space bar, the stimulus was displayed
until the participant made a response (or timed out after 60 s).
Participants had to press either the left (present) or right
(absent) arrow key. Auditory feedback in the form of a beep
immediately followed incorrect key presses. Before the start of
the experiment participants underwent a nine-point calibration
sequence and a block of 10 practice trials.
3. Results
(a) Experiment 1: search efficiency in compound arrays
RTs for targets on the homogeneous side of the search array
were faster than for targets on the heterogeneous side (mean
RT and s.d.: homogeneous, 1.75 (SD 0.13); heterogeneous,
3.94 (SD 2.19); absent, 7.0 (SD 4.5); figure 2). Mean accuracy
for target absent trials was �100%. For target present, partici-
pants were more accurate when the target was located
on the homogeneous side of the display (98.4%) than the
heterogeneous side (72.8%; t13 ¼ 6.7, p , 0.001).
Figure 3 shows the proportion of fixations each observer
made on the heterogeneous side of the display on target
absent trials only. The strictest criterion of optimal strategy
in this experiment is not to look to the homogeneous side
at all. (The pilot study in the electronic supplementary
material demonstrates that it can easily be ascertained
whether the target is present on this side or not from the cen-
tral fixation point.) Fixations on this side will provide no new
information on the target’s location, so participants should
direct all fixations to the heterogeneous side. As we can see
in figure 3, only participant 11 is close to executing the opti-
mal strategy. In aggregate, our participants spend more
time fixating the heterogeneous than the homogeneous side
(figure 4), but for the majority of participants a large
proportion of fixations are made to the homogeneous side.
Next we measured the effect of this fixation inefficiency on
the search performance of each participant. Inefficiency was
defined as the proportion of the first five fixations made
during target absent trials that were directed to the homo-
geneous side of the display. This measure was significantly
correlated (figure 5a) with the median reaction time on target
present trials, both when the target was located on the hetero-
geneous half of the display (r ¼ 0.93, p , 0.001) and on the

 homogeneous side (r ¼ 0.81, p ¼ 0.002). These correlations
are also significant when taking the proportion of the first
10 fixations (heterogeneous r ¼ 0.89, p , 0.001; homogeneous
r ¼ 0.71, p ¼ 0.01).
We also quantified the effect of fixation inefficiency on
search time using a linear mixed-effect model (using the lme4
[19]) package for R [20] with random intercepts and slopes.
We were specifically interested in the effect of the number of
homogeneous fixations on any given trial on the reaction
time to find the target (including participant as a random
factor). For target absent trials, we find an additional 357 ms
(bootstrapped 95% confidence interval: 196–516 ms) in RTs
for every fixation made to the homogeneous side of the array
(figure 5b). When the target is present on the heterogeneous
side, each fixation on the homogeneous side slows reaction
time by 547 ms. Homogeneous fixations even slow reaction
time to find the target when it is present on the homogeneous
side (by 159 ms), consistent with the conclusions from our pilot
study (see the electronic supplementary material) that these
fixations are not necessary to find the target.
(b) Experiment 2: predicting search performance on
compound arrays from performance on uniform arrays
In this experiment, participants searched uniform homo-
geneous, uniform heterogeneous and compound search
arrays. Summary of participants’ RTs and accuracy across
all the conditions can be seen in table 1.
When the target was absent, participants made, on average,
seven eye movements in the uniformly homogeneous display
before making a response. Each of these fixations can be con-
sidered unnecessary, given that participants in the pilot
experiment were close to 100% correct with no eye movements
at all. If search on compound trials is simply an (optimal) com-
bination of suboptimal search behaviour on the two types of
uniform trials, then RT on the compound trials should equal
the average of RT on the uniform homogeneous and uniform
heterogeneous trials. If equal, this would suggest our partici-
pants
simply
sacrifice
efficiency
to
satisfy
an
overly
conservative certainty criterion. To the extent that search is
slower on compound trials compared to the average of the
two types of uniform trials, an inflated certainty criterion
alone does not explain poor search behaviour.
Figure 6 shows predicted and actual RT for each participant
on the target absent trials. All participants lie above the red line
(although three are very close). This indicates that participants
are taking longer than predicted from the uniform trials. To
quantify the size of the difference, we calculated the ratio of
split versus predicted RT for each participant. If participants’
behaviour on the compound trials matches an average of the
behaviour they exhibit on the uniform trials, the ratio should
be around 1. The mean ratio was 1.21 (+0.15), significantly
higher than 1 (t13 ¼ 30.95, p , 0.001). This additional slowing
of reaction time in the compound trials can be attributed
specifically to an inefficiency in allocating fixations to locations
that yield the most information.

 4. General discussion
Our participants consistently failed to adopt an optimal strat-
egy when searching a compound array with easy search on
one side and difficult search on the other. In the first exper-
iment, a large number of saccades were directed to the easy
side of the display, even though the target would be clearly vis-
ible from the central fixation point if it were present on this side.
Each one of these unnecessary fixations slows search substan-
tially. In the second experiment, we demonstrated that
participants also search uniform displays inefficiently, gener-
ally making many more fixations than is necessary to find the
target. Although we demonstrated in the pilot experiment
that the peripheral information is sufficient to decide the
target is present or absent, observers may be driven to verify
their peripheral estimate based on the clearer, higher-resolution
visual information that can be obtained by bringing that image
onto the fovea, even though this verification comes at great cost
to speed. Indeed, previous results suggest participants tend to
make saccades even when theyare not necessary [21,22]. Impor-
tantly, the inefficiency of search in the compound display
reflects more than an additive combination of how inefficiently
participants search the two types of uniform displays. The
additional inefficiency associated with the more complex
array can be attributed to a failure to direct saccades to locations
that can easily be estimated to provide the most information.
Taken together, these experiments clearly demonstrate
that a large proportion of fixations made during visual
search are not guided by the principles behind the optimal
search model [6,7]. Not only do observers demonstrate a
preference for making far more fixations than is required—
presumably to increase their perceived certainty—but even
taking these suboptimal fixations into account, fixations in
the split-screen array are not directed to locations that yield
the most information. Participants were instructed to respond
as quickly as possible, and responses on target absent trials
were slowed by 360 ms for every fixation they made on
the homogeneous side of the array. Nonetheless, it is possible
that participants are capable of searching more efficiently but,
for reasons of motivation or distraction, fail to implement an
efficient strategy. Further research would be needed to deter-
mine the extent to which reward or greater pressure speed
(for example, by using response deadlines) would increase
efficiency. It is important to note, however, that our results
demonstrate an efficient strategy is not the dominant or
default mechanism for fixation selection.
What is the mechanism for fixation selection? A viable
alternative to the optimal search model, recently proposed by
Clarke et al. [12], is that a scan-paths during visual search can
be modelled using a random walk. This model is consistent
with the mean performance of our participants, which is
around 50% to each side. A largelystochastic model would pre-
dict this pattern. That said, this average performance masks a
large range of individual differences. Indeed, one of our partici-
pants does follow the predictions of the ideal search model,
and two others come quite close. Similarly, the stochastic
model can explain some, but not all, of our individual partici-
pants. It therefore seems likely that different models will be
required to fit different observers. An intriguing question is
the extent to which search and foraging strategies are stable
in individuals over time and across different contexts, shed-
ding light on the nature of the efficient foraging, as well as
the constraints on fixation selection mechanisms and how
these are imposed. It would also be interesting to test the
extent to which an individual’s (in)efficient foraging decisions
generalize to other kinds of decisions. For example, we have
recently reported profound inefficiencies in decisions about
how to allocate resources over multiple possible goals [10].
The wide range of individual differences observed in both
that study and the current one presents an intriguing parallel.
Individual differences aside, on the whole we can con-
clude that eye movements are not driven preferentially to
locations that produce the most information. These results
demonstrate that the processes underlying fixation selection
during visual search may be more random and less efficient
than current popular models suggest.
