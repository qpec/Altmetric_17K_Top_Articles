Since modern foods are unnaturally enriched in single metabolites, it is important to
understand which metabolites are sensed by the human body and which are not. We pre-
viously showed that the fatty acid stearic acid (C18:0) signals via a dedicated pathway to
regulate mitofusin activity and thereby mitochondrial morphology and function in cell culture.
Whether this pathway is poised to sense changes in dietary intake of C18:0 in humans is not
known. We show here that C18:0 ingestion rapidly and robustly causes mitochondrial fusion
in people within 3 h after ingestion. C18:0 intake also causes a drop in circulating long-chain
acylcarnitines, suggesting increased fatty acid beta-oxidation in vivo. This work thereby
identifies C18:0 as a dietary metabolite that is sensed by our bodies to control our mito-
chondria. This could explain part of the epidemiological differences between C16:0 and C18:0,
whereby C16:0 increases cardiovascular and cancer risk whereas C18:0 decreases both.

 T
he human diet is a complex mixture of metabolites, and the
composition of our diet impacts our health and the
development of diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular
complications, and cancer1,2. Whilst many different metabolites
influence human physiology and health when ingested, not all
metabolites within a given class are actively sensed by the body to
respond appropriately to changes in dietary intake and to
maintain homeostasis. For instance, glucose elicits a strong
insulin secretion response, systemically activating insulin and
PI3K signaling, thereby restoring blood sugar levels to “normal”,
whereas fructose only elicits a weak response3–5. Similarly, the
anabolic and oncogenic mTORC1 pathway is activated by the
presence of some amino acids such as leucine, arginine, and
methionine, but not by other amino acids6. Since it is likely
unfeasible for an organism to sense all metabolites in its diet, it
appears that evolution has selected certain metabolites within a
class to be sensed by the organism and to act as proxies for the
intake of the entire class. This sensing mechanism works in
nature because natural food sources usually do not contain only
single metabolites from a class, for instance leucine, but not other
amino acids. Hence sensing one metabolite from a class is suffi-
cient to indicate the presence of the entire class in the food.
Modernization has changed this, however, providing humans
with food sources particularly high in single metabolites such as
fructose or palmitic acid. This leads to mismatches between what
the body senses and what it is actually ingesting, especially when
the ingested metabolite is not the one being sensed. Hence it is
critical to understand which metabolites are being sensed by the
human body, and what physiological responses they elici
Within the metabolite class of fatty acids, epidemiological
studies have found that various fatty acids have different biolo-
gical consequences when ingested. Saturated fatty acids in gen-
eral, and palmitic acid (C16:0) in particular, are harmful in part
because they elevate LDL cholesterol and atherosclerosis risk7.
Dietary stearic acid (C18:0), however, does not increase athero-
sclerosis risk, and, if anything, actually reduces LDL cholesterol7–10.
Indeed, increased levels of circulating C18:0 lipids are associated
with reduced blood pressure, improved heart function, and reduced
cancer risk11–15. Hence unlike other saturated fatty acids, and
contrary to the general belief that saturated fatty acids are
harmful, C18:0 appears to have some beneficial effects on human
health. The molecular mechanisms of this, however, are not clear.
We recently reported that C18:0 regulates mitochondrial
morphology and function in Drosophila and in human cells via a
dedicated signaling pathway16. When C18:0 levels are low, the
Transferrin Receptor TfR1 activates JNK signaling, leading to
ubiquitination and inhibition of Mitofusin 2 and hence mito-
chondrial fragmentation and reduced oxygen consumption16. In
the presence of C18:0, the fatty acid molecule is covalently
attached to TfR1 via a thioester bond in a post-translational
modification called stearoylation, analogous to protein palmi-
toylation by C16:0. This leads to reduced JNK activation by TfR1,
to mitochondrial fusion, and to elevated oxygen consumption16.
Hence, in cell culture, cells sense the levels of C18:0 and respond
via a signaling pathway that ends in mitochondrial activation.
Unexpectedly, feeding C18:0 to Drosophila animals also regulated
mitochondrial fusion in vivo, and led to organismal con-
sequences: dietary supplementation with C18:0 was able to par-
tially rescue the impaired locomotion and reduced lifespan
resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutations in
the Parkinsons genes Pink1 or parkin16. This indicates that flies
can sense and respond to levels of C18:0 in their diets. Humans,
however, ingest more lipids than flies17,18. Furthermore, humans,
like flies, express Elovl6, which elongates C16:0 to C18:0 thereby
providing an endogenous source of C18:0. Hence it is unknown
whether in humans this C18:0 sensing mechanism is saturated
with dietary and/or endogenous lipids, or if it is poised to sense
changes in dietary C18:0 intake, responding by altering mito-
chondrial morphology and function. To test this, we undertook
here a clinical study, manipulating dietary C18:0 intake in both
healthy and diabetic subjects, and assayed mitochondrial mor-
phology and function in vivo. We found a surprisingly robust
response, with C18:0 ingestion causing fusion of mitochondria in
90% of all tested subjects. C18:0 intake also led to a drop in
circulating acylcarnitine levels, suggesting increased fatty acid
beta-oxidation in vivo. This identifies C18:0 as a lipid metabolite
sensed in humans, and raises the possibility that dietary C18:0
activates part of the physiological response through which the
human body handles lipids.
Results
C18:0 ingestion causes mitochondrial fusion. We aimed to
study whether acute changes in C18:0 intake in humans affect
mitochondrial morphology and function in vivo. C18:0 is enri-
ched in meat, in dairy products, and in certain seeds such as
cocoa beans. Hence we first asked subjects to eat for 2 days a low-
fat vegan diet which is low in C18:0, to bring everyone to a low-
C18:0 baseline regardless of their habitual diet (Fig. 1a). We then
asked the subjects to drink a banana milk shake containing 24 g of
C18:0, roughly equivalent to the amount of C18:0 present in 200 g
of milk chocolate19. To assay mitochondrial morphology, we
chose to study neutrophils because, unlike other tissues, blood
can be obtained in a minimally-invasive manner, and neutrophils
are the most abundant blood cell type that has mitochondria. We
took one “basal” blood sample prior to the 2-day low-C18:0 diet,
one blood sample directly prior to the C18:0 drink (“0 h”), and
then two blood samples at 3 and 6 h after C18:0 ingestion
(Fig. 1a). The 3 and 6 h timepoints were selected because a pre-
vious study found 13C-labeled C18:0 levels peak in blood 3 h after
ingestion20. For every blood sample, we scored neutrophil mito-
chondrial morphology by staining whole blood immediately after
collection with CD15 and CD16 to mark neutrophils, and
mitotracker to mark mitochondria (Fig. 1b). We then classified
neutrophils as having either “fragmented”, “intermediate”, or
“fused” mitochondria as shown in Fig. 1b. Our study was
designed as a cross-over study, with each subject repeating this
procedure twice, once with a C18:0 banana milk shake, and once
with a mock banana milk shake lacking the C18:0, in randomized
order (Fig. 1a). The entire study was double-blinded, so all data
collection and analysis was done without the knowledge of
sample identity. Both the basal and the 0 h blood samples were
collected in the morning without breakfast to obtain standardized
clinical blood parameters. We recruited 10 healthy volunteers and
11 type-2 diabetic patients (Supplementary Fig. 1), to test if
diabetic patients respond differently, given that diabetic patients
have altered lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function com-
pared to healthy subjects21,22. The baseline characteristics for all
subjects are presented in Supplementary Data 1–2.
After 2 days of a low-C18:0 diet, the mitochondria in
neutrophils are quite fragmented; 50% of all neutrophils had
fragmented mitochondria and fewer than 10% had fused
mitochondria prior to ingesting the C18:0 drink (“0 h”, Fig. 1c).
This was true in all 21 subjects combined (Fig. 1c), in the healthy
subjects (Fig. 1e) and in the type-2 diabetic patients (Fig. 1g).
Ingestion of the C18:0 drink caused mitochondria to fuse, both 3
and 6 h after ingestion: the fraction of neutrophils with
fragmented mitochondria dropped significantly from 50 to 25%
while the fraction of neutrophils with fused mitochondria
increased significantly from 7 to 27% (Fig. 1c). This occurred in
both healthy and diabetic subjects (Fig. 1e, g), and the response
was quite robust, with 19 of the 21 subjects (90% of subjects)

 having more fused mitochondria after ingestion of C18:0. In
contrast, the mock drink lacking C18:0 did not cause significant
mitochondrial fusion in the very same people (Fig. 1d, f, h and
Supplementary Fig. 2 for a statistical analysis comparing C18:0 to
mock, using simplex plots on the entire distribution). Although
not significant, the mock drink did cause a small but consistent
increase in mitochondrial fusion (Fig. 1d), perhaps because the
banana + milk used for the shake contain roughly 0.5 g of C18:0.
To display data for each individual subject, and to perform
subsequent regression analyses, a “mitochondrial fusion factor”
was calculated for each sample (Fig. 1i, for the calculation see
figure legend and Methods). Analysis of this factor confirmed that
mitochondria became more fused upon ingestion of the C18:0
drink, but not the mock drink, in both healthy and T2D groups

 (Fig. 1i). Together, these data indicate that dietary C18:0 rapidly
induces mitochondrial fusion in human neutrophils. Although we
did not assay mitochondrial morphology in other tissues, we
previously published that various different human and Drosophila
cell types respond to C18:0 in tissue culture16. Hence we believe it
is possible that other cells in the human body may also fuse their
mitochondria after a meal containing C18:0, although future
work will be required to test this.
Blood C18:0 levels correlate with mitochondrial morphology.
Since neutrophil mitochondria fuse after ingestion of C18:0, this
suggests serum levels of C18:0 increased after C18:0 feeding. To
this end, we quantified the fatty acids present in serum tria-
cylglycerides (TAG, Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 3). As
expected, the level of C18:0 in serum triglycerides (C18:0-TAG)
dropped significantly after 2 days of low-fat vegan diet (Fig. 2a),
and increased upon ingestion of the C18:0 drink, but not the
mock drink (Fig. 2b, c). Interestingly, C16:0-TAG levels did not
drop after 2 days of the diet, despite the diet being low-fat
(Fig. 2d), suggesting that levels of circulating C16:0 are more
buffered in our bodies. Circulating C16:0-TAG also did not
increase in response to C18:0 feeding (“3 h” vs “0 h”, Fig. 2d).
Together, these data indicate that circulating levels of C18:0 are
responsive to acute changes in diet, and that they are more
responsive than C16:0.
In agreement with our finding that C18:0 induces mitochon-
drial fusion in cell culture16, serum C18:0-TAG levels correlated
significantly with the mitochondrial fusion factor across all
subjects, diets, and timepoints (p < 0.0001, Fig. 2e–h). This
correlation was specific to C18:0, as there was no significant
correlation between C16:0-TAG and mitochondrial fusion factor
(Fig. 2i). We wanted to test if there are any additional factors
affecting mitochondrial morphology besides C18:0. Hence in
addition to fatty acids, we also measured other metabolites and
markers in the blood samples including cholesterol, glucose,
insulin, methylglyoxal (MG), iron, ferritin, transferrin, and
hepcidin. None of them showed C18:0-dependent changes in
levels (Supplementary Figs. 4–5). Interestingly, the low-fat vegan
diet increased hepcidin levels (Supplementary Fig. 5), but
additional work will be needed to understand the significance
of this. A multivariate regression analysis identified only C18:0-
TAG as significantly contributing to determine the mitochondrial
fusion factor (Supplementary Data 3). We noticed that the
mitochondria in some people fused particularly strongly in
response to C18:0 ingestion, whereas the mitochondria in 10% of
the people did not respond. Hence we correlated the mitochon-
drial response upon C18:0 ingestion (i.e., change in mitochondrial
fusion factor 3 h vs 0 h) to 44 different clinical parameters, but
there were no significant correlations with any of the measured
parameters after accounting for multiple testing (Supplementary
Data 4).
To make sure that the mitochondrial fusion elicited by the
C18:0 banana milk shake was due solely to the C18:0, and not to a
combined action of C18:0 with other components of the milk
shake, we asked one subject in a pilot study to ingest pure C18:0
emulsified in drinking water and scored the subject’s mitochon-
drial
morphology.
As
expected,
ingestion
of
pure
C18:0 significantly induced mitochondrial fusion in vivo (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6a).
Two lines of reasoning suggested this mitochondrial fusion
response should be specific for C18:0. Firstly, epidemiological
studies have shown that palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid
(C18:0) have very different effects on physiology and health7,11–15.
Secondly, our previous work in cell culture showed that
mitochondrial fusion is very specifically induced by C18:0 and
not by any other fatty acid such as C16:0, C18:1, or C20:0,
because there is a dedicated signaling pathway that senses
C18:016. To confirm the specificity of this response in vivo, we
first asked the same subject to ingest a banana milk shake
containing C16:0 (equimolar amount as in the C18:0 drink).
Unlike the C18:0 drink, the C16:0 drink did not induce
mitochondrial fusion (Supplementary Fig. 6b). C16:0 ingestion
also did not increase C16:0-TAG levels in blood (Supplementary
Fig. 6c). This suggests that serum C16:0-TAG levels are more
buffered than C18:0-TAG levels, in agreement with the fact that
C16:0-TAG levels also do not drop after 2 days of a low-fat diet
(Fig. 2d). To increase the statistical power of our C16:0 findings,
we re-recruited six healthy subjects from our main study, and
asked them to follow a low-fat vegan diet for 2 days. In a double-
blinded fashion, four of these subjects then received a banana
milk shake containing C16:0 (equimolar to the C18:0 drink). As a
positive control, one subject received a C18:0 drink, and as a
negative control one subject received a mock drink. We then
scored neutrophil mitochondrial morphology at 3 h post-inges-
tion, since this timepoint showed the largest effect in the main
study. This confirmed that all five subjects receiving a C16:0 drink
did not fuse their mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 6f), and the
positive and negative-control subjects responded as anticipated
(Supplementary Figs. 6g–h). Since 90% of all subjects in the main
study responded to C18:0 by fusing their mitochondria, this
means the lack of mitochondrial fusion in response to C16:0 in all
six tested subjects (Supplementary Figs. 6b and 6f) is highly
significant (p = 10−5). Thus the mitochondrial fusion caused by
C18:0 is specific to C18:0 and not caused by C16:0 ingestion.
C18:0 ingestion reduces circulating acyl-carnitines. We next
asked if there is a functional consequence of C18:0 ingestion. We
previously reported that reduced C18:0 levels lead to reduced
mitochondrial respiration in Drosophila16, possibly due to
reduced mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. To test if beta-
oxidation is affected, we measured long chain acylcarnitine levels
in the blood samples. Acylcarnitines are fatty acids coupled to
carnitine that are ready for mitochondrial import for beta-
oxidation. When beta-oxidation is impaired relative to the fatty
acid supply, these long chain acylcarnitines accumulate and are
released into the blood where they can be detected, forming the

 basis for screenings of newborn babies for beta-oxidation
defects23. Interestingly, we found that serum long chain acylcar-
nitine levels increase significantly after a 2-day low-fat vegan diet
(“0 h” vs “basal”, Fig. 3a, b). Conversely, long chain acylcarnitine
levels dropped significantly after ingesting the C18:0 drink but
not the mock drink (Fig. 3a, b), suggesting that C18:0 intake
increases fatty acid beta-oxidation in vivo. Particularly striking,
C18:0 ingestion leads to an increase in circulating C18:0-TAG
levels (Fig. 2), but causes a decrease in circulating C18:0 acyl-
carnitine levels (Fig. 3a), indicating that the acylcarnitine drop is
not due to reduced substrate availability but rather to increased
acylcarnitine usage. In the mock treatment, there was no drop in
acylcarnitine levels at 3 h, however at 6 h there was a non-
significant trend towards reduced levels. This could be due to the
fact that all subjects received a low-fat vegan lunch after the 3 h
timepoint to avoid hunger-induced artefacts. Furthermore, we
also found a significant, negative correlation between long chain
acylcarnitine levels and C18:0-TAG levels across all subjects,
diets, and timepoints (Fig. 3c, d). In contrast, C16:0 ingestion did
not lead to a drop in acylcarnitine levels (Supplementary
Fig. 6d–e), indicating that the effect of C18:0 on acylcarnitines is
specific. Together, these data indicate that C18:0 ingestion leads
to a physiological response in vivo.
C18:0 effects in the medium-term. The data thus far relate to the
main goal of this study, which was to determine whether an acute
increase in dietary C18:0 intake can induce mitochondrial fusion
in vivo in humans. This appears to be the case, indicating that this
signaling pathway in humans is indeed tuned to sense changes in
C18:0 intake. This raises the question whether people with different
dietary habits, and hence different long term C18:0 intake levels,
have long-term differences in their mitochondrial morphology and
function. To this end, we compared our “basal” data, prior to the 2-
day low-C18:0 diet, to the “0 h” data on both the days the subjects
received the C18:0 drink or the mock drink (Fig. 4a). Interestingly,
mitochondria were consistently more fragmented (lower mito-
chondrial fusion factor) after 2 days of low-C18:0 diet in all subject
groups—healthy volunteers, type-2 diabetics, vegetarians, and
omnivores (Fig. 4a). This is consistent with the reduced C18:0-TAG
levels in serum after 2 days of low-C18:0 diet (Fig. 2a) and suggests
that dietary C18:0 intake can affect circulating C18:0 levels and
mitochondrial morphology not only acutely but also within a
medium-term 2-day timeframe. This result is particularly striking
given that both the “basal” blood samples and the “0 h” blood
samples were collected after overnight fasting, indicating that the
C18:0 effect persists for hours. We had four vegetarians in our study
(Supplementary Data 1). Since vegetarians eat no meat, but still eat
dairy products, both of which are rich in C18:0, there is the pos-
sibility that vegetarians could have reduced serum C18:0 levels.
However, we did not see any differences between vegetarians and
omnivores in either basal C18:0-TAG levels (Fig. 4c, d) or mito-
chondrial fusion (Fig. 4b). This lack of an association could be due

 to the small sample size, however, it could also be due to com-
pensatory intake of C18:0 from dairy products in vegetarians, or
from increased endogenous biosynthesis. Hence it is possible that
long-term constitutive differences in dietary C18:0 intake might be
buffered by changes in endogenous biosynthesis. Important to note,
however, is that all our blood samples were taken after overnight
fasting and no breakfast in the morning, hence they represent
“baseline” levels of circulating C18:0 in the absence of recent food
ingestion. The data in Fig. 2 show that circulating C18:0 levels
increase after eating C18:0. Hence if people were sampled at ran-
dom times of the day, there would likely be a difference in vege-
tarians vs omnivores due to the different C18:0 content of the food
they consume. Future work will be required to address this
question.
Discussion
In this study, we identify stearic acid (C18:0) as a metabolite that
is sensed in our diets and regulates human physiology, in parti-
cular mitochondrial morphology and function. Intriguingly, our
data imply that when we eat, the C18:0 in our food causes our
mitochondria to fuse within a few hours of eating. This response
is impressively robust: we obtained statistically significant results
with only 10 healthy subjects. Unlike C18:0, C16:0 does not have
this effect. This could explain part of the difference between C16:0
and C18:0 observed epidemiologically, whereby C16:0 increases
the risk for cancer and cardiovascular risk whereas C18:0 reduces
both7,11–15: if dietary C18:0 signals the intake of lipids to the
human body, to activate a physiological response for lipid
handling which includes fatty acid beta-oxidation, whereas C16:0
does not, this would imply that C16:0 ingestion will lead to more
fat accumulation in the body than C18:0 ingestion. Fat accumu-
lation, in turn, is a risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and
cancer. Hence the balance of C16:0 to C18:0 in our diets may be
important. A diet rich in C16:0 could be particularly bad because
it provides lipids to the body without activating the mitochondrial
response that C18:0 does. We included both healthy subjects and
type-2 diabetic patients in our study, however we did not see
significant differences in the basal mitochondrial morphology
(Fig. 4a) or in the response to C18:0 ingestion in these two groups
(Fig. 1). If anything, C18:0 ingestion caused more robust mito-
chondrial fusion in diabetic patients than in controls. Further
work will be necessary to test whether longer-term dietary
interventions with C18:0 can affect baseline levels of C18:0 in the
serum, and hence mitochondrial morphology and function.

 Methods
Design of the cross-over clinical study. The study was conducted at the
Department of Endocrinology of Heidelberg University Hospital, and was
approved by the local ethics committee (Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty
of Heidelberg: Trial Code Number S-675/2015). The study was registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier NCT02957838. Study participants provided
written informed consent.
The study size was designed in consultation with a biometrician, Johannes
Krisam (in the Acknowledgements), based on data from a pilot study, and using
formulas for cross-over studies from ref. 24. These calculations showed that for
reaching a significance of 0.01 and a power of 95%, 10 participants per group are
required. We therefore screened 284 outpatients of the Department of
Endocrinology (see Supplementary Fig. 1), 108 of which were eligible and thus
were contacted. Assuming there would be roughly a 50% drop-out rate, we
recruited 20 subjects per group who gave oral consent. In the end 12 healthy
controls and 11 type-2-diabetics gave written consent. The recruited type-2 diabetic
patients did not require insulin treatment and did not have severe complications
yet. Neither the type-2-diabetics nor the control participants suffered from other
severe diseases such as cancer or anemia. The baseline characteristics of the groups
are provided in Supplementary Data 1–2. Two healthy controls preferred not to
repeat the second arm of the cross-over study, but did not withdraw consent
concerning data generated in the first round. Hence data from the remaining 10
healthy controls that completed both arms of the study were analyzed.
Basal blood samples were collected at 9 a.m. after subjects had been eating a
regular diet, followed by an overnight starvation and no breakfast. The subjects
were then asked to follow a low-fat, vegan diet (low C18:0 diet) for 2 days and to
maintain a diary of the food and drink they consumed, thereby allowing
participants to self-report violations of the diet rules. On the day of the first
timecourse, “0 h” blood samples were collected at 9 a.m. after an overnight fast and
no breakfast. Immediately afterwards the subjects received a banana milk shake
with or without 24 g C18:0 (see below for the recipe). At 12 p.m., the “3 h” blood
samples were collected and the subjects then received a standardized low-fat vegan
lunch. At 3 p.m., “6 h” blood samples were collected. Each subject underwent the
whole procedure twice for the cross-over timecourse, once with the C18:0 milk
shake and once with the mock milk shake lacking C18:0, in a randomized order
and with a wash-out phase of at least 3 days between experiments. The timecourse
intervals were determined based on ref. 20. The timecourse was performed with a
maximum of three subjects per day because the blood samples had to be processed
and imaged fresh and soon after collection. The blood samples were labeled with
codes and only the person who drew the blood samples knew the identity of the
samples. The whole study was performed in a double-blind fashion—i.e., the
people who processed the samples did not have any information about the samples.
After all data were collected and all analyses were performed, the data were
unblinded.
Preparation of the banana shakes. For the C18:0 drink, 24 g of C18:0 intended
for human consumption (stearic acid, Sigma-Aldrich W303518) were mixed with
100 ml of low-fat milk. This amount of C18:0 was selected by calculating the C18:0
content of a high fat meal19. The mixture was microwaved to emulsify the fatty
acid. One small banana was added and the whole mixture was homogenized with a
hand blender. The volume was completed to 250 ml with more low-fat milk. The
mock drink was prepared the same way without fatty acids. For the C16:0 drink,
21.56 g (an equal molar amount to 24 g of C18:0) of C16:0 intended for human
consumption (palmitic acid, Sigma-Aldrich W283207) was added instead. Milk-
shakes were prepared approximately 90 min before consumption.
Sample collection. Blood was drawn with butterfly needle sets at each timepoint
from a different location. Several tubes were filled with different blood amounts for
the following purposes: (1) one was filled with 4.5 ml to extract a leukocyte pellet
after erythrocyte lysis, which was stored at −80 °C, (2) a smaller EDTA tube
(Sarstedt S-Monovette® 2.7 ml K3E) was filled with 1 ml of blood for mitochondrial
morphology scoring via fluorescence microscopy, (3) to keep serum samples, 4 ml
of blood were drawn into a Sarstedt S-Monovette® 7.5 ml Z tube, then centrifuged
at 2500g for 10 min, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C, (4) for analysis of insulin, 2 ml
of blood were drawn into a Sarstedt S-Monovette® 7.5 ml Z-Gel tube, and (5) for
other serum parameters 2 ml of blood were put into a Sarstedt S-Monovette® 7.5 ml
LH-Gel. Both tubes #4 and #5 were submitted to the high-throughput analysis
facilities of the Heidelberg University Central Laboratory, which is accredited
according to DIN EN ISO 15189. On the “basal” day, an additional Sarstedt S-
Monovette® 2.7 ml K3E tube was filled with 2 ml for high throughput cell counting
via a Siemens ADVIA 120 Hematology system and measurement of HbA1c by a
Biorad Variant II Turbo.
Staining and imaging of neutrophil mitochondrial morphology. Blood was
collected into EDTA containing tubes (Sarstedt S-Monovette® 2.7 ml K3E). An
aliquot of 100 μL whole blood was put into a 1.7 ml tube and the following anti-
bodies and dyes were added: CD15-FITC (BD Pharmingen 555401, Lot: 5267530,
1:10 dilution), CD16-BV421 (BD Pharmingen 562878, Lot: 6007759, 1:20 dilution),
Mitotracker Red (Cell Signaling #9082, 200 nM final) and DRAQ5 (Abcam
ab108410, 10 μM final). CD15 and CD16 are neutrophil cell surface markers and
DRAQ5 is a nuclear stain. Mitotracker red was used to image mitochondria.
Staining was performed at room temperature for 15 min. Afterwards, 10 μL stained
blood was put on a glass slide and covered with a coverslip. The resulting smear
was immediately visualized with a fluorescence microscope. Importantly, this
method allowed us to score mitochondrial morphology within 30 min of blood
collection. Mitochondrial morphology of approximately 50 CD15, CD16+ neu-
trophils per subject per timepoint were scored. Cells containing a single large
interconnected network were scored as “fused”, cells containing individual dots
were score as “fragmented”, and all other cells were scored as “intermediate”. To
ensure consistency of scoring between samples, all blood samples in this paper were
scored in a blinded fashion by one person. Four samples were also scored inde-
pendently by a second person, arriving at qualitatively similar results (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7).
Calculation of mitochondrial fusion factor. The fraction of neutrophils with
fragmented, intermediate, and fused mitochondria were calculated and then the
following formula was used: mitochondrial fusion factor = 1 × fraction of neu-
trophils with intermediate mitochondria + 2 × fraction of neutrophils with fused
mitochondria.
Statistical analyses. Data sampling: Data from the two healthy subjects who did
not complete both arms of the study were not used. Otherwise, for all statistical
analyses, all available data were used and none were excluded.
Student t-tests were used to test significance in Figs. 1c–i, 2a–d, 3a, b, 4a–d,
Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 5, and
Supplementary Fig. 6f. For all these figures except Fig. 4b–d, this was done using a
2-tailed, paired t-test because the comparisons are between two timepoints for the
same subject (i.e., paired). For Fig. 4b–d, a 2-tailed unpaired student’s t-test was
used because the comparison is between subjects. For Fig. 1c–h, and
Supplementary Fig. 6f, 55–60 neutrophils were scored for mitochondrial
morphology per blood sample. These data were used to calculate the percentage of
neutrophils in that sample with fragmented, intermediate or fused morphology.
These percentages from the various samples were combined to generate the plots
shown in figures. For instance, in Fig. 1c at 0 h, the “fragmented” bar represents the
average of 21 datapoints, corresponding to the percentage of neutrophils with
fragmented mitochondria from the 21 subjects, and the error bars represent the
standard deviation of these 21 datapoints. Significance was tested by applying the
student t-test to the “fragmented” category, comparing the 3 h or the 6 h timepoints
to the 0 h timepoint (i.e., 21 datapoints for the 3 h or the 6 h timepoint, compared
to the 21 datapoints for the 0 h timepoint.) For Figs. 1i, 2a–d, and 4a, b, a
“mitochondrial fusion factor” was calculated per sample as described above,
thereby yielding a single datapoint per sample (shown as individual dots in the
figures). The t-tests were then applied to these datapoints.
The significance of the changes seen in Fig. 1c, e, g was confirmed by using
simplex plots (Supplementary Fig. 2). Simplex plots allow the depiction of data
with multiple variables which sum to a constant. In this case, the fractions of
neutrophils with fragmented, intermediate or fused mitochondria from one blood
sample sum to 1. In the plots, each individual is color coded with a particular color,
which is kept the same across timepoints (Supplementary Fig. 2). With an R
package that is described in refs. 25,26, centered planar transformations were
applied to map the data isometrically to a 1-dimensional Euclidian vector space,
and then a linear mixed effect model was fitted for each composite to test the effect
of the drinks (C18:0 vs mock). This method directly assesses the statistical
significance of the difference between the C18:0 and the mock drinks in terms of
changes in mitochondrial morphology across timepoints. (n = 21 subjects, of
which 10 healthy and 11 type-2 diabetic.)
The Mann–Whitney test was used to test for significance in Supplementary
Figures 6a,b,g,h and Supplementary Figure 7, since each of these figure panels
represents data from a single subject. For each blood sample, 60 neutrophils were
scored as follows: 1 (fragmented), 2 (intermediate), and 3 (fused). The non-
parametric Mann–Whitney test was then applied in Microsoft Excel to assess the
significance in the change in neutrophil score distribution between samples. Hence
in these panels only, the statistical test was applied on the distribution of scores of
individual neutrophils.
For Figs. 2e–i and 3c, d, correlations and their significance (two-tailed p) were
calculated with Pearson’s test in GraphPad Prism.
The significance of the lack of mitochondrial fusion caused by C16:0 was tested
as follows. The null-hypothesis to be rejected was that the effect of C16:0 ingestion
is non-inferior to that of C18:0 ingestion. C18:0 caused mitochondrial fusion in 19
of the 21 subjects. (Mitochondrial fusion was defined as an increase in the
mitochondrial fusion factor (mff) by at least 0.19, which is 1.64 standard deviations
of the mitochondrial fusion factors observed at 0 h, corresponding to a false-
discovery rate of 5%.) Since 90% of all subjects (19 out of 21) responded to C18:0
ingestion, there is a 10% probability of a subject not fusing their mitochondria
upon C18:0 ingestion. If C16:0 behaves like C18:0, we would expect 10% of subjects
to not fuse their mitochondria by chance upon C16:0 ingestion. Instead, 5 out of
5 subjects did not fuse their mitochondria after C16:0 ingestion, which has a
probability of happening of (10%)5 = 10−5. Hence we reject the null hypothesis
that C16:0 causes mitochondrial fusion like C18:0.

 Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed with SPSS statistical
analysis software with mitochondrial fusion factor as the dependent variable and all
parameters shown in Supplementary Data 3 as independent variables using default
parameters and confidence interval = 95%.
Quantification of lipids with GC/MS. Lipids were extracted from 400 μL of
serum by adding 600 μL of KH2PO4 followed by 1 ml of methanol (Sigma
646377) and finally 3 ml of chloroform (Sigma 650471) in a 7 ml screw top tube
(SLS TUB1202). Internal standards were added in the chloroform and were as
follows: FFAs, deuterated tridecanoic acid (C13D25O2H, Cambridge Isotopes
DLM1392), 20 μg; Triglycerides 1,2,3-Triheptadecanoylglycerol (Sigma), 40 μg;
Phospholipids, 1,2-diundecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti polar
lipids), 40 μg. Samples were vortexed for 2 min then centrifuged for 10 min at
720 g. The lower layer was collected and transferred to a new 7 ml glass tube and
dried under nitrogen.
Lipid classes were separated by solid phase extraction. To carry out the solid
phase extraction, the lipids were resuspended in 1 ml chloroform and transferred
to aminopropyl (NH2) BondElut solid-phase extract columns (Agilent,
12113014). The flowthrough was collected along with two washes of 1 ml
chloroform and dried under the nitrogen stream. The flowthrough contained the
neutral lipid fraction. Phospholipids were eluted from the column by addition of
2 ml of 60:40 chloroform methanol. Finally FFAs were eluted using 100:2:2
Chloroform:Methanol:Glacial acetic acid. All fractions were dried under
nitrogen.
To derivatize the samples into fatty acid methyl esters, 875 μL of a mixture of
chloroform (Sigma 650471): methanol (Sigma 646377): boron trifluoride-
methanol solution (Sigma 134821) (15:19:1 v/v/v) was added to the dried lipids
in 7 ml glass tubes. The tubes were then sealed and incubated in an oven at 80 °C
for 90 min. After cooling the samples, 1 ml of hexane (Sigma 34859) and 500 μL
of water (Sigma 34877) were added, and the samples were vortexed and
centrifuged at 720g at room temperature for 5 min. The upper organic layer was
transferred into glass autosampler vials and dried under a nitrogen stream. The
samples were reconstituted in 1 ml hexane prior to the gas chromatography
analysis.
Gas chromatography was performed on an Agilent 7890B GC using a Thermo
Scientific TR-FAME column (length: 30 m, internal diameter: 0.25 mm, film size:
0.25 µm) with helium as carrier gas (1.9 ml/min). FAMEs were detected using a
5977A MSD. Inlet and MSD temperature were set at 230 °C. The oven program
temperature steps used were as follows.
The column was held at 100 °C for 2 min, then the temperature was increased to
150 °C at a rate of 25 °C/min. The temperature was further increased to 162 °C at a
rate of 2.5 °C/min, with a hold time of 3.8 min. Subsequently, the temperature was
increased to 173 °C at a 4.5 °C/min rate, followed by a hold time of 5 min. The
column temperature was further increased to 210 °C with a 5 °C/min rate. Finally,
the temperature was increased to 230 °C with a 40°C/min rate, followed by a hold
time of 0.5 min. The transfer line temperature was set at 240 °C, and the ion source
was at 250 °C, operating at 70 eV for electron ionization (EI). The detector was
initiated after 240 s, and full scan spectra were collected over a range of 50–650 m/z.
To identify the FAME peaks, retention times of peaks in the samples were
compared with those in external standards (Restek 35077 Food industry FAME
mix and Supelco 46904 Vaccenic Methyl ester) using MS Quantitative Analysis
(Agilent). The areas of specific ions for each fatty acid were used for quantification,
with the background subtracted to the values of blank samples. The quantity of a
given fatty acid methyl ester was determined using a standard curve generated
using the external standard and normalized to the relevant internal standard for the
given fraction. Data is expressed as molar%, which was calculated by dividing any
individual fatty acid methyl ester by the all the detected fatty acids in a given
sample.
Quantification of acylcarnitines. Acylcarnitines were determined in serum by
electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) according to a
modified method as previously described27, using a Quattro Ultima triple quad-
rupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an elec-
trospray ion source and a Micromass MassLynx data system. In particular, 5 µl of
plasma were placed on a 4.7 mm filter paper punch, dried at room temperature
overnight and extracted with 100 µl of deuterium-labeled standard solution in
methanol27.
Other blood and serum measurements. Methylglyoxal was measured according
to ref. 28. Human serum hepcidin was measured using the “Bioactive hepcidin 25
ELISA kit” (DRG International) following manufacturer’s instructions. The hep-
cidin concentration was extrapolated against a standard curve by using the four
parameters logistic model of the Graphpad Prism v7 software. All other blood
parameters were measured by the clinical analysis facilities of the Heidelberg
University Hospital Central Laboratory, which is accredited according to DIN EN
ISO 15189.
