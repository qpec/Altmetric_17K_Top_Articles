Abstract
Background: Migraine has been recognized as one of the leading causes of disability in the 2013 Global Burden of
Disease Study and seriously affects the quality of patients’ life, current treatment options are not ideal. Monoclonal
antibodies to calcitonin gene-related peptide and its receptor (CGRP-mAbs) appear more promising for migraine
because of considerably better effect and safety profiles. The objective of this study is to systematically assess the
clinical efficacy and safety of CGRP-mAbs for migraine therapy.
Methods: A systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library and Baidu Scholar was performed to identify
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which compared the effect and safety of CGRP-mAbs with placebo on migraine.
Regarding the efficacy, the reduction of monthly migraine days from baseline to weeks 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12; responder
rates were extracted as the outcome measures of the effects of CGRP-mAbs. Regarding the safety, total adverse events,
the main adverse events, and other adverse events were evaluated.
Results: We found significant reduction of monthly migraine days in CGRP-mAbs vs. placebo (weeks 1–4: SMD −0.49,
95% CI −0.61 to −0.36; weeks 5–8: SMD −0.43, 95% CI −0.56 to −0.30; weeks 9–12: SMD −0.37, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.24).
50% and 75% responder rates (OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.99 to 3.37; and OR 2.91, 95% CI 2.06 to 4.10) were significantly
increased compared with placebo. There was no significant difference in total adverse events (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.91
to 1.51), and the main adverse events including upper respiratory tract infection (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.55),
nasopharyngitis (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.16), nausea (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.32), injection-site pain (OR 1.73, 95% CI
0.95 to 3.16) and back pain (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.90) were not obviously changed compared with placebo control,
but the results showed significant increase of dizziness in CGRP-mAbs vs. placebo (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 9.45).
Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that CGRP-mAbs are effective in anti-migraine therapy with few adverse
reactions, but more and larger sample-size RCTs are required to verify the current findings.

 Background
Migraine is a common, chronic neurovascular disorder
with a female prevalence of 17% and a male prevalence of
9%, typically characterized by disabling attacks of severe
headache and autonomic nervous system dysfunction
[1, 2]. Different pathological and genetic mechanisms
may be related to a variety of clinical manifestations.
The etiology and pathogenesis of migraine are not yet
completely understood.
Although studies on molecular players involved in the
disease are incomplete, recent preclinical and clinical
findings indicate that there is a clear correlation between
migraine and the release of the neurotransmitters and
vasoactive substances, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-HT) [3–5], calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)
[6–8], and dopamine (DA) [9–11]. Over the past de-
cades, ergotamine and the triptans, both of which are
serotonin 5-HT agonists, have been proved effective
for treating acute migraine, and are widely used in
clinical practice [12, 13]. However, a significant number of
migraine cases do not respond to these therapies. In
addition, adverse effects such as cardiovascular concerns
limit their use [14]. Calcitonin gene-related peptide
(CGRP), is recognized as a crucial peptide in the patho-
physiology of migraine, and has been increasingly investi-
gated. CGRP receptor antagonists (CGRP-RAs), including
olcegepant (BIBN4096BS), telcagepant, MK-3207 and
MK-0974, have shown considerable efficacy in the treat-
ment of migraine. However, several were discontinued
due to concerns for hepatotoxicity with daily use [15–20],
others were discontinued for other (or unknown) reasons.
Recently developed CGRP-mAbs were triggered much
interest in the migraine community [21–24]. LY2951742
(Arteus Therapeutics), ALD403 (Alder Biopharmaceuti-
cals), TEV-48125 (previously named as LBR-101) (Labrys
Biologics-TEVA) and AMG 334 (Amgen) have com-
pleted Phase II and are undergoing III clinical trials [24].
These drugs have show anti-migraine activity with few
adverse events. However, their clinical efficacy and safety
lack systematic evaluation. Therefore, we performed a
systematic review and meta-analysis on the overall
efficacy and safety of CGRP-mAbs for migraine based
on recent clinical findings.
Methods
Literature search and inclusion criteria
Two reviewers (MH and HYX) independently searched
PubMed,
Cochrane
Library
and
Baidu
Scholar
for
articles
by
entering
“headache”
or
“migraine”
and
“monoclonal anti-CGRP antibody” or “monoclonal anti-
body to calcitonin gene-related peptide” as search terms.
We then examined all articles and their reference lists to
expand potentially relevant articles. The searches were
limited to human studies published in English from
inception of the databases to Nov 1, 2016. The articles
were included in the meta-analysis if they met the fol-
lowing criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
evaluating the efficacy and safety of CGRP-mAbs for mi-
graine; (2) no restrictions on population characteristics,
blind and publication type; (3) participants diagnosed
with migraine by using the recognized criteria, such as
the International Classification of Headache Disorders,
third edition (ICHD-3, beta version) and the Inter-
national Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II)
[25–27] and (4) monotherapy with CGRP-mAbs and
placebo in any form or in any dose or in any administra-
tion methods as treatment group and control group
respectively. Studies were excluded when one of the fol-
lowing situations occurs: (1) subjects were animals; (2)
interventions were drug combinations; and (3) except
for RCTs, other types of trials such as cross-over
designs, healthy controlled trials and self-contrast trials.
Disagreement between two reviewers was settled by
consensus or consultation with a third author (JHC or
YQC).
Quality assessment
The quality we studies was assessed independently by
two investigators using the 7-item criteria in Review
Manager Software version 5.3 provided by the Cochrane
Collaboration [28]. The 7-item criteria mainly contained:
(1) random sequence generation; (2) allocation conceal-
ment; (3) blinding of participants and personnel; (4)
blinding of outcome assessment; (5) incomplete out-
come data; (6) selective reporting and (7) other bias.
Each item involved assigning a judgment of high, low, or
unclear risk of material bias. Detailed criteria for making
judgments about the risk of bias from each of the items
in the tool are available in the Cochrane Handbook [29].
Discrepancies were reconciled by discussing with corre-
sponding author.
Data extractions and syntheses
The data with regard to the reduction of monthly mi-
graine days was continuous, and presented as the
mean ± SD for the meta-analysis. The expression of
the mean ± SE was converted to the mean ± SD based
on the principles of the Cochrane Handbook for System-
atic Reviews of Interventions [30]. For the graphic, the ori-
ginal means and SDs were extracted with the aided
software GetData Graph Digitizer 2.25 (http://getdata-
graph-digitizer.com/) [31]. The data syntheses were per-
formed by RevMan 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford,
England). The reduction of monthly migraine days for
each trial was analyzed by calculating standardized mean
difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) with
a fixed- or random- effect model. Other data including re-
sponder rates and adverse events were dichotomous, and
Hou et al. The Journal of Headache and Pain  (2017) 18:42 
Page 2 of 12
 were calculated by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence
intervals (CI) with a fixed- or random-effect model.
Heterogeneity analysis
The extent of heterogeneity may influence the results
and conclusions. Therefore it is necessary to perform
meta-analysis using Chi-square test. I2 values smaller
than 50% indicate no significant heterogeneity, and are
acceptable. The fixed-effect model of analysis is then
appropriate. Otherwise, the random-effect model is
considered [32, 33].
Risk of publication bias
Some situations may result in publication bias of the
meta-analysis. On the one hand, studies with negative
effects might not be published, and left out of the litera-
ture. On the other hand, studies without sufficient data
might have been excluded based on the inclusion and
exclusion criteria. Therefore, funnel plots were used to
detect publication bias of the meta-analysis. When the
funnel plot was approximately symmetrical and a major-
ity of studies were located at its superior part, it was
considered that there was no significant publication bias
in the meta-analysis [31, 34].
Results
Study selection and inclusion
A total of five references were retrieved in our search
[35–39]. Based on the title and abstract, 16 relevant
articles were excluded due to their nature as case report
or review, or summary of clinical experiences, or not be-
ing clinical trials (Fig. 1). Among five selected articles,
two trials were TEV-48125 trials, and others were
ALD403, AMG 334, and LY2951742. The characteristics
of the five included studies were summarized in Table 1.
Quality of the included studies
The quality assessments of the included studies were
summarized in Figs. 2 and 3. As listed in Figs. 2 and 3,
all trials were randomized to receive CGRP-mAbs and
placebo; participants from multicentres in the USA were
randomly assigned by an interactive voice response or
interactive
web
response
system.
Site
investigators,
patients, and sponsors were masked from treatment
selection during the study. Only one study reported the
pharmacists were aware of group assignment. But they
had a sole responsibility was to drug accountability and
preparation at each site [37]. Another reported the spon-
sored study personnel did not have access to patient-
level clinical data apart from samples they were assaying
and analysing [39] Overall, the included studies were
suitable for the meta-analysis of the effect and safety of
CGRP-mAbs for migraine.
Effectiveness of CGRP-mAbs on migraine
The reduction of monthly migraine days
All five trials (1001 subjects) included in this meta-
analysis were evaluated for the change of monthly
migraine days [35–39]. The data showed a significant
decrease in the mean numbers of monthly migraine days
after therapy with CGRP-mAbs compared with placebo,
from a baseline to weeks 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12. As shown in
Fig. 4, CGRP-mAbs showed a significant overall effect at
weeks 1–4 (SMD −0.49, 95% CI −0.61 to −0.36) (Fig. 4a),
weeks 5–8 (SMD −0.43, 95% CI −0.56 to −0.30) (Fig. 4b),
and weeks 9–12 (SMD −0.37, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.24)
(Fig. 4c). The I2 value (χ2 = 0.47/0.91/1.53, P = 0.98/0.92/
0.82, I2 = 0%) revealed a non-significant heterogeneity
among the included trials. Risk of publication bias within
studies was shown in Fig. 5. The inverse funnel plot was
approximately symmetrical, thus there was no significant
publication bias in the meta-analysis of the reduction of
monthly migraine days.
Fifty and seventy five percent responder rate
Fifty percent responder rate was counted in the five
included studies with a total of 962 subjects [35–39], and
75% responder rate was counted in four included studies
with a total of 719 subjects [35–38]. 100% responder rate
was not analyzed due to the small sample size (only 2
trials), but the results with CGRP-mAbs were increased
compared with placebo [37, 38]. Figure 6 showed signifi-
cant decrease in 50 and 75% responder rates of CGRP-
mAbs for migraine compared with placebo (OR 2.59, 95%
CI 1.99 to 3.37; and OR 2.91, 95% CI 2.06 to 4.10). Further-
more, the meta-analysis results of the included tails found
a low level of heterogeneity (χ2 = 1.31 and 1.44, P = 0.86

(Fig. 7).
Safety assessments of CGRP-mAbs for migraine
All five trials reported adverse events to different de-
grees. The frequent adverse events in patients receiv-
ing ALD403 were upper respiratory tract infection,
urinary tract infection, fatigue, back pain, nausea and
vomiting,
and
arthralgia
[38].
Patients
receiving
LY2951742 reported upper respiratory infections and
viral infections [37]. The common adverse events in
migraine
patients
receiving
TEV-48125
were
mild
injection-site pain, pruritus and erythema [35, 36].
The most frequently reported adverse events were
nasopharyngitis, fatigue, and headache in migraine
receiving AMG334 [39].
Total adverse events
All five studies reported a total of 571 patients with
adverse
events
[35–39].
The
meta-analysis
results
showed total adverse events in migraine patient with
CGRP-mAbs therapy were not significantly different
from those observed in placebo groups (OR 1.17, 95%
CI 0.91 to 1.51) (Fig. 8). The findings suggest the safety
of CGRP-mAbs for migraine. The results of meta-
analysis showed that the included studies were highly
homogeneous (χ2 = 0.60, P = 0.96, I2 = 0%). No obvious
publication bias was found in the funnel plot (Fig. 9).
Main adverse events
The most frequent adverse events in migraine with
CGRP-mAbs were upper respiratory tract infection,
nasopharyngitis, nausea, dizziness, injection-site pain
and back pain [35–39]. As shown in Fig. 10, there was
no obvious difference between CGRP-mAbs and placebo
group in main adverse events (upper respiratory tract in-
fection: OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.55 (Fig. 10a); naso-
pharyngitis: OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.16 (Fig. 10b);
nausea: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.32 (Fig. 10c);
injection-site pain: OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.95 to 3.16
(Fig. 10e); back pain: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.90
(Fig. 10f), but the significant increase of dizziness in
CGRP-mAbs was found (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 9.45)
(Fig. 10d). All I2 value revealed a non-significant hetero-
geneity among the included studies. The funnel plot was
not created for the main adverse events due to the small
sample size.

 Other adverse events
Other adverse events in migraine treated with CGRP-
mAbs, such as sinusitis [35], headache [36, 39], and arth-
ralgia [37], were reported in included studies. However,
we did not conduct systematic analysis due to fewer
number samples. Furthermore, there was no evidence of
any effect of CGRP-mAbs on hepatotoxicity, only four
patients had transient increases in liver enzyme concen-
trations during the treatment phase, which was consid-
ered non-treatment related [36]. No clinically important
changes in cardio-cerebrovascular system or electrocar-
diograms (ECGs) or other vital signs were recorded.
Discussion
The role of CGRP in migraine
CGRP, a neuropeptide released from activated trigeminal
sensory nerves, may play an important role in the patho-
physiology of migraine. In preclinical studies, concentra-
tions of CGRP in trigeminal ganglion (TG), trigeminal
nucleus caudalis (TNC) and venous blood during mi-
graine onset are elevated in rat or cat models compared
with control [40–42]. Furthermore, relief of migraine
pain coincides with reduction or normalization of CGRP
concentrations in brain tissue and blood after treatment
with 5-HT1B/1D or CGRP receptor agonists or also
Botulinum toxin (BTX) [43, 44]. In clinical studies,
serum and plasma levels of CGRP are increased in pa-
tients with migraine onsets as compared with healthy sub-
jects [45–47]. In preclinical results, regulating disordered
CGRP production may reduce continued occurrence of
migraine after taking anti-migraine drug [48–51]. Based
on these studies, it is possible to prevent migraine by
blocking CGRP binding to its receptor.
Strengths of CGRP-mAbs for treating migraine
In recent years, CGRP-RAs have been considered as a
novel, approach to treating migraine because they showed
promising efficacy in several clinical trials [8, 18–20, 52–54].
However, liver toxicity with their daily administration was
found. Thus further developments of some CGRP-
RAs including telcagepant MK-0974 and MK-3207 were
terminated [18–20, 55], two CGRP-RAs, B144370A and
BMS-927711, showed a good clinical efficacy in the phase
II studies but their development status is not clear and it
is not known whether these drugs showed liver toxicity
[52, 54], and ubrogepant MK-1602, has been tested in two

 phase II trials, but the results have not been reported yet
[55]. CGRP-mAbs are macromolecules made of proteins
that directly target CGRP or its receptor. The mAbs
are behaved to bind and neutralize the excessive
CGRP release by perivascular trigeminal sensory nerve
fibers. Clinical studies showed a remarkable effect on
migraine with no abnormal liver side effect for in
subject receiving CGRP-mAbs [24]. The satisfactory
safety could be mostly because of its high target spe-
cificity with minimum off-target toxicity. Furthermore,
as summarized in the five included article in this
study [35–39], CGRP-mAbs were administered sub-
cutaneously or intravenously, allowing for monthly or
even quarterly dosing due to their long half-lives and
absence of liver toxicity. These strengths should en-
hance the long-term usage of this therapy compared
with oral drugs, which had to be taken once or twice
daily. Meanwhile, it may avoid hepatotoxicity and
drug-drug interactions, and become ideal candidates
for preventive treatment of migraine. In the next
years the potential advantages of CGRP-mAbs should
also be evaluated in direct comparative studies with
the available preventive treatments.
CGRP-mAbs are behaved to long half-lives for mi-
graine prevention, and not cross the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) due to a large particle size. The mechanisms
through which CGRP relieves migraine and the precise
site of action of CGRP-mAbs are not completely
understood. CGRP is expressed both centrally and
peripherally. Recently, the view that there is no clear
proof of breakdown or leakage in the BBB during mi-
graine attack has emerged [56–58], so macromolecu-
lar drugs may not cross the BBB. Another view is
that these macromolecular drugs act mostly peripher-
ally
for
prophylaxis
[55,
59,
60].
However,
these
hypotheses have not been verified. In the next years
the potential mechanisms of CGRP-mAbs should be
explored by pharmacological methods.
Clinical efficacy and safety of CGRP-mAbs for migraine in
the meta-analysis
This meta-analysis examined the efficacy and safety of
CGRP-mAbs in comparison with placebo for the treat-
ment of migraine, and validated CGRP as a therapeutic
target. In our study, five randomized controlled trials
involving 1001 participants were included. The results

 indicated CGRP-mAbs as effective in migraine preven-
tion. Furthermore, safety data from the five trials involv-
ing 1014 participants suggest that the main adverse
events including upper respiratory tract infection, naso-
pharyngitis, nausea, injection-site pain, back pain and
other adverse events were not different between treat-
ment and placebo group except for dizziness. Thus,
CGRP-mAbs had a favorable safety profile, and there
were no specific adverse events as seen in phaseI study
[61, 62]. The possibility of dizziness related to chronic
depletion of systemic levels of CGRP still needs to be
evaluated in long-term treatment studies. This meta-
analysis supports the importance of CGRP in the patho-
physiology of migraine.

 Limitations of the meta-analysis
This meta-analysis also has some limitations. First, nu-
merous phase III trials of CGRP-mAbs are undergoing
without conclusion and publication so far [24, 55]. Only
five studies were included in our analysis. Second,
some were completed by three lead authors between
the five studies [35–38], which may contribute to
publication bias. Third, the evaluation indexes are
relatively simple, and may have affected our meta-
analysis results. Especially the efficacy of CGRP-mAbs
for migraine, only two evaluation indexes, including
reduction of monthly migraine days and responder
rates, were included. In order to comprehensively
evaluate the effects of CGRP-mAbs, quality of life in
migraine should be assessed using the Role Function-
Restrictive (RFR), Role Function-Preventive (RFP), and
Emotional Function (EF) subscales of the Migraine-
Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ), Headache
Impact Test (HIT-6), Migraine Disability Assessment
(MIDAS), and Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement
Information System (PROMIS). Nevertheless, considering
that only two studies [37, 39] conducted the relative
indexes, meta-analysis was not performed. Furthermore,
there was no long-term follow-up of the participants, so
longer term safety and efficacy of CGRP-mAbs remains
unknown.
Conclusions
In conclusion, based on the results of 5 Phase II
trials, this review and meta-analysis revealed a signifi-
cant effect of CGRP-mAbs for migraine prevention
with few adverse reactions. Ongoing Phase III multi-
center RCTs will need to be analyzed for publication
for whether they reproduce these findings. Furthermore,
given that RCTs are designed to test a therapeutic hy-
pothesis under an optimal setting, several factors may
comprise their strict and controlled conditions and
thus restrict their application to real-world clinical
practice, the mathematical views provided by RCTs
should be tested in real-life studies that confirmed
the positive result of previous clinical trials, and
weighed against the flexibility of clinical practice and
real-world settings in the future.
