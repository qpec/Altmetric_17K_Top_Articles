Background. A previous meta-analysis of 3 zinc acetate lozenge trials estimated that colds were on average 40% shorter for 
the zinc groups. However, the duration of colds is a time outcome, and survival analysis may be a more informative approach. The 
objective of this individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was to estimate the effect of zinc acetate lozenges on the rate of recovery 
from colds.
Methods. We analyzed IPD for 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials in which 80–92 mg/day of elemental zinc were admin-
istered as zinc acetate lozenges to 199 common cold patients. We used mixed-effects Cox regression to estimate the effect of zinc.
Results. Patients administered zinc lozenges recovered faster by rate ratio 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.1–4.7). The effect 
was not modified by age, sex, race, allergy, smoking, or baseline common cold severity. On the 5th day, 70% of the zinc patients 
had recovered compared with 27% of the placebo patients. Accordingly, 2.6 times more patients were cured in the zinc group. The 
difference also corresponds to the number needed to treat of 2.3 on the 5th day. None of the studies observed serious adverse effects 
of zinc.
Conclusions. The 3-fold increase in the rate of recovery from the common cold is a clinically important effect. The optimal 
formulation of zinc lozenges and an ideal frequency of their administration should be examined. Given the evidence of efficacy, 
common cold patients may be instructed to try zinc acetate lozenges within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.

Five previous meta-analyses concluded that there is strong 
evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten the duration of colds 
[1–5], although there were shortcomings in the Cochrane 
review [5–7]. The benefit of zinc lozenges in the controlled 
trials has not been uniform; however, most of the negative tri-
als appear to have been the result of either too low a daily zinc 
dose or inappropriate excipients that bound the zinc ions [1, 
2, 8–10].
The 5 previous meta-analyses that supported zinc lozenges’ 
impact on colds investigated the effect on the duration of the 
common cold [1–5]. Two of them focused on the same set of 3 
trials as the current study: one used a t test [3] and another used 
a linear model of individual patient data (IPD) [4] to analyze 
common cold duration. However, duration is a time outcome, 
and survival analysis may be a more appropriate approach than 
a t test to analyze such data.
Survival analysis allows visual inspection of survival curves, 
which is more informative than comparing mean and stand-
ard deviation values of a t test. Furthermore, survival analysis is 
not hampered by censored data, ie, patients who were followed 
but dropped out before recovery; however, in a t test analysis, 
such observations need recovery day imputation. In addition, 
outlier patients with extended colds will increase the standard 
deviation estimates and decrease the statistical power of a t test. 
In contrast, a few patients who have extended colds minimally 
influence survival analysis.
Two zinc salts have been used in the zinc lozenge trials: zinc 
gluconate and zinc acetate. Because acetate binds zinc ions less 
strongly than gluconate, zinc acetate has been proposed as the 
optimal salt for lozenges [1, 10]. Three controlled trials exam-
ined the effect of >75 mg/day zinc as zinc acetate lozenges on the 
duration of the common cold [11–13]. For this IPD meta-analy-
sis, we used the data sets of the 3 trials.
The goal of this IPD analysis was (1) to analyze the effect of zinc 
acetate lozenges on the rate of recovery from the common cold 
and (2) to determine whether the effect of zinc is modified by age, 
sex, race, allergy, smoking, or by baseline common cold severity.

METHODS
Selection of the Trials
This IPD meta-analysis was restricted to placebo-controlled tri-
als on zinc acetate lozenges for patients with naturally acquired 
common cold infections in which the dosage of elemental zinc 
was >75 mg/day. We restricted our analysis to high-dose trials, 
because previous studies indicated lack of effect of low doses, 
<75 mg/day of zinc [1, 2, 5, 10]. Previous searches of the liter-
ature [1, 2, 5] identified 3 trials that meet these selection cri-
teria [11–13]. No additional zinc acetate lozenge trials were 
found by searching PubMed and Scopus using the free search 
terms “zinc” and “lozenge*” (February 13, 2017). The 3 sets of 
IPD were available with the collaboration of the authors of the 
studies with the first author. Details of the 3 included trials are 
shown in Supplementary File 1.
Outcomes and Extraction of the Data
The outcome in this meta-analysis was the day of recovery from 
the common cold. In the original trial report, Petrus et al [11] 
published both the mean duration of various cold symptoms 
and the duration of the longest cold symptom. We used the lat-
ter as the outcome in this study because it is consistent with the 
outcome definition in the Prasad et al [12, 13] studies. There 
were no censored observations in the 3 included trials.
Statistical Methods
We used the coxph procedure of the survival package of 
R-project, version 3.2.5 [14] to separately analyze the 3 individ-
ual studies to yield the rate ratio (RR) for the recovery from the 
common cold and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The cox.
zph procedure was used to confirm that the proportional haz-
ard assumption was satisfied for the 3 trials (see calculations in 
Supplementary File 2).
We pooled the data of the 3 trials using Cox mixed-effects 
modeling; the modeling was completed using the coxme pro-
cedure of the coxme package of R [14]. We used the study as a 
random variable for the zinc lozenge effect and also as an inde-
pendent explanatory variable [15, 16]. We also calculated the 
stratified Cox model that allows for a distinct baseline hazard in 
each study by using the strata statement in the coxph procedure. 
Finally, we calculated the pooled Cox model by consolidating 
the data from the 3 different studies with the coxph procedure, 
ignoring study as a clustering variable.
The interaction between the zinc lozenge effect and a sub-
group was calculated by first adding zinc and the subgroup to 
the Cox model; then the interaction term between zinc and the 
subgroup was added. The P value for the zinc and subgroup 
interaction was calculated from the Analysis of Deviance Table 
by the analysis of variance. The ratio of RRs for 2 subgroups was 
also calculated to compare the effectiveness of zinc in the com-
plementary subgroups. The Kaplan-Meier estimates were calcu-
lated using the survfit procedure of R. Two-tailed P values were 
used. Our calculations are described in detail in Supplementary 
File 2.
RESULTS
The 3 included trials were randomized, double-blind, place-
bo-controlled trials with few dropouts. Subgroup distributions 
of baseline variables are shown in Table 1. The 3 trials had a 
total of 199 common cold patients. The majority were white 
and women; 80% were in the age range 20 to 50 years old. One 
third of the patients had allergies. One quarter of patients were 
African Americans, and 10% reported “other” as their ethnic 
background. Although Petrus et al [11] did not collect infor-
mation about smoking, one quarter of the participants in the 
2 studies by Prasad et al [12, 13] were smokers. The daily dose 
of elemental zinc from the lozenges was 80 to 92 mg/day in the 
3 studies. Prasad et al [12, 13] included patients only if they 
had had colds for 24 hours or less; the delay between the onset 
of symptoms and treatment initiation is not available for the 
Petrus et al [11] trial. See further methodological and other 
details of the 3 trials in Supplementary File 1.
Petrus et al [11] instructed patients to dissolve 1 lozenge in 
the mouth every 1.5 hours while awake on the first day and then 
1 lozenge every 2 hours on the following days; lozenges dis-
solved in approximately 15 minutes [11]. Prasad et al instructed 
patients to dissolve in their mouth 1 lozenge every 2–3 hours

 Zinc Lozenges in Common Cold Treatment • OFID • 3
while awake; lozenges dissolved in approximately 30 minutes 
[12, 13]. The effect of zinc acetate lozenges in the studies and 
their pooled effects are shown in Table 2. When the study was 
used as the random effects variable for the zinc lozenge effect, 
the Cox mixed-effects model indicated that the rate of recovery 
from the common cold was improved by RR of 3.1 in the zinc 
group. The stratified Cox regression model was calculated as a 
sensitivity approach, and it provided a similar estimate of zinc 
lozenge effect (Table 2). Finally, if the results of the trials were 
combined ignoring the study as a clustering variable, then the 
rate of recovery was 2.6 times higher among the zinc partici-
pants. The latter estimate of effect is lowest, which is explained 
by the substantially greater zinc effect in the 2 small studies by 
Prasad et al [12, 13] (N = 48 and N = 50, respectively), com-
pared with the smaller effect in the larger study by Petrus et al 
[11] (N = 101) (see Table 2).
Table 3 shows the subgroup analyses of the zinc lozenge 
effects between the 2 complementary subgroups. The effect of 
zinc acetate lozenges was not modified by age, sex, race, allergy, 
smoking, or baseline severity of the common cold. Age was also 
analyzed as a continuous variable, and it did not interact with 
the zinc lozenge effect. In addition, because the age ranges of the 
3 trials were substantially different, the interaction between the 
zinc effect and age was also calculated within the 3 trials, and 
no substantial modification was seen (Supplementary File 2). 
Finally, we also calculated the ratios of the RRs in the comple-
mentary subgroups and their 95% CIs (Supplementary File 2).
Kaplan-Meier curves of the 3 studies and of the pooled 
observations are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1A shows the pooled 
observations for the zinc and placebo groups from the 3 tri-
als, ie, the combined data from the 3 separate trials. Ignoring 
study as a clustering variable led to a conservative estimation of 
the zinc effect (see above). Figure 1A is thus biased towards an 
underestimation of the zinc lozenge effect. Difference between 
the zinc and placebo groups in the Kaplan-Meier estimates 
gives the proportion of common cold patients who benefited 
from zinc. The greatest difference was on the 5th day: 70% of the 
zinc acetate lozenge patients had recovered from the common 
cold compared with 27% of the placebo patients (Figure 1A). 
The ratio of these proportions is 2.6, which is consistent with 
the Cox regression estimates (Table 2). The estimated difference 
in proportions equates to 43 percentage points more patients 
being cured by the zinc lozenges by day 5 compared with pla-
cebo. This corresponds to the number needed to treat to benefit 
1 patient (NNT) of 2.3. Thus, 1 of every 2.3 patients on average 
did not suffer from the cold on the 5th day because of the zinc 
acetate lozenge treatment. Table 4 shows the NNT values for 
days 2 to 8 of the common cold. On the 3rd to 7th days, the 
NNT values are less than 4, indicating that in this time range 
more than 1 of 4 patients benefited from zinc acetate lozenges. 
Figure 1B−D show the individual Kaplan-Meier curves for the 
3 trials.
DISCUSSION
When we combined the results of 3 zinc acetate lozenge trials, 
we found that zinc lozenges increased the rate of recovery from 
the common cold by 3-fold. There was no indication that the 
effect was modified by age, sex, race, allergy, smoking, or base-
line common cold severity. Therefore, the overall estimate of 
zinc acetate lozenges, the 3-fold increase in the recovery rate, 
seems to be a useful estimate irrespective of variations by these 
factors.
The 3 included studies were randomized, double-blind, 
and placebo-controlled trials with few dropouts. We had 
available IPD for the 3 trials that allowed effective analysis of 
possible subgroup differences in the zinc lozenge effect. The 
common cold infections in the 3 trials were natural common 
cold infections, and not infections generated by inocula-
tion of a specific virus. Therefore, the findings may be gen-
eralized to the community with diverse respiratory viruses 
causing the common cold. The 3 studies excluded common 
cold patients with serious or chronic illnesses, and thus the 
findings should not be extrapolated to such people. It is also 
worth noting that the Prasad et al [12, 13] trials included 
patients only if the cold had lasted 24 hour or less, but the 
delay in the Petrus et al [11] trial is not available. Thus, it 
is not evident that zinc lozenges have effects if the cold has 
lasted for a longer time.

An important benefit of survival analysis is that it allows 
visual inspection and formal analysis of treatment effects over 
time. In addition, survival analysis is not confounded by cen-
sored data or outlier patients who have particularly long colds. 
The 3 included trials had no censored observations; however, 2 
zinc gluconate lozenge trials had a number of censored obser-
vations and thus the benefit of survival analysis materializes in 
their analysis [17, 18] (see below).
In our current analysis, the mixed-effects Cox regression indi-
cated a 3.1-fold increase in the recovery rate by zinc acetate loz-
enges (Table 2). This estimate appears substantially greater than 
the estimated 36% to 40% reduction in the duration of colds 
in the same 3 trials [4]. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier curves 
allowed us to calculate NNT = 2.3 on the 5th day, indicating 
that, on average, 1 in 2.3 participants was cured by the 5th day 
because of zinc lozenges. Thus, the survival analysis gives use-
ful additional information on the effects of treatment compared 
with analyzing only the effects on common cold duration.
Our meta-analysis was restricted to 3 trials with zinc acetate 
lozenges with >75 mg of elemental zinc per day. Zinc gluconate 
has also been used as a constituent for zinc lozenges and has 
been examined in controlled trials. The acetate anion binds zinc 
cations less strongly than gluconate, ie, zinc acetate has a lower 
stability constant than zinc gluconate. Therefore, zinc acetate 
has been proposed as a more suitable salt for lozenges than 
zinc gluconate [1, 10]. Two zinc gluconate lozenge trials [17, 
18] published survival curves, and the effect of zinc gluconate 
on the rate of recovery can be calculated for those studies (see 
Supplementary File 2).
Eby et al [17] found that zinc gluconate increased the rate 
of recovery from the common cold with RR of 3.5 (95% CI, 
1.8–6.7; 207 mg/day zinc); Mossad et al [18] found that zinc 
gluconate increased the recovery rate with RR of 2.8 (95% CI, 
1.8–4.5; 80 mg/day zinc). Thus, the CIs of those 2 zinc gluco-
nate trials are consistent with the pooled estimate calculated for 
the 3 zinc acetate trials in the current IPD meta-analysis. On 
the 5th day of the treatment, NNT was 2.4 in the Eby et al [17] 
trial and 3.7 in the Mossad et al [18] trial, and these estimates 
are also quite consistent with the findings from the zinc acetate 
lozenge trials. A significant effect of zinc gluconate lozenges on 
common cold duration was also reported by Godfrey et al [19], 
but survival curves were not published. However, the number 
of patients cured by the 7th day was published yielding RR of 
1.55 (95% CI, 1.13–2.1; NNT = 3.3; 192 mg/day zinc). Thus, 
even though acetate binds zinc ions less strongly than gluco-
nate, the chemical difference between the 2 salts may not have 
much importance at the clinical level.
Subgroup analysis of the 2 above-mentioned zinc gluconate 
trials cannot be carried out because data on individual baseline 
variables are no longer available [17, 18]. Nevertheless, given 
that the mechanism of zinc lozenge effect seems to be based on 
the release of free zinc ions [1, 8–10], it seems unlikely that the 
anion of the salt might influence the effect of the released zinc 
ions. Thus, it seems probable that the lack of subgroup differ-
ences in the effects of zinc acetate lozenges (Table 3) also applies 
to the zinc gluconate lozenges.
A few zinc lozenge studies did not find effects on the com-
mon cold symptoms, but most of the negative studies used low 
doses of zinc, <75 mg/day, and/or the lozenges contained citric 
acid or other substances that bind zinc ions [1, 2, 8–10]. Thus, 
low availability of free zinc ions explains many negative findings 
of zinc lozenge trials.
Farr and Gwaltney [20] speculated that bad taste of zinc loz-
enges might explain their apparent benefit. However, bad taste 
was not a problem in any of the 3 zinc acetate lozenge trials 
included in this IPD meta-analysis. There was no substantial 
difference in the occurrence of adverse effects between the zinc 
and placebo groups, and only a few participants dropped out 
[11–13]. A few patients identified the lozenge in the most recent 
trial, but the efficacy of the zinc lozenges remained the same 
when the analysis was restricted to those who remained blinded 
at the end of the trial [13].
The 80 to 92 mg/day doses used in the zinc acetate lozenge 
trials are substantially higher than the recommended daily 
intakes of 11 mg/day for men and 8 mg/day for women in 
the United States [21]. However, zinc has been administered

and ≥8 points in the Prasad et al [13] study (see Supplementary File 1 for details).

in doses of 100 to 150 mg/day to certain patient groups for 
months with few adverse effects [22–27]. Furthermore, start-
ing from adolescence, 150 mg/day of zinc is currently one of 
the standard treatments for Wilson’s disease, which usually 
means taking such doses for the rest of the life [28–31]. In the 
treatment of Wilson’s disease, zinc has had an excellent safety 
profile, although it has caused gastric irritation in 5%–10% of 
the patients [29]. Therefore, it seems highly unlikely that the 
dosage used in the 3 included trials, 80–92 mg/day for 1–2 
weeks, might lead to long-term adverse effects. Furthermore, if 
a patient considers that some zinc lozenges taste bad, he or she 
can discontinue their usage.
Although there is strong evidence that properly composed 
zinc lozenges can increase the rate of recovery from the com-
mon cold, the majority of zinc lozenges on the market appear to 
have either too low doses of zinc or they contain substances that 
bind zinc ions, such as citric acid [1]. Thus, the results of this 
meta-analysis should not be directly extrapolated to the wide 
diversity of zinc lozenges on the current market.
CONCLUSIONS
Our IPD meta-analysis found that zinc acetate lozenges 
(>75 mg of zinc per day) may triple the rate of recovery from 
the common cold, and the effect is not modified by age, sex, 
race, allergy, smoking, or baseline common cold severity. The 
calculated 3-fold increase in the rate of recovery is a clinically 
important effect. The optimal formulation of zinc lozenges and 
the most efficacious frequency of their administration should

be further examined. Nevertheless, given the strong evidence 
of efficacy and the low risk of adverse effects, common cold 
patients may already be encouraged to try zinc acetate lozenges 
not exceeding 100 mg of elemental zinc per day for treating 
their colds within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.
