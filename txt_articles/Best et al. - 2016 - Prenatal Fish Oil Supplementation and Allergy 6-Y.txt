abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Evidence from randomized controlled trials in early infancy suggest 
that prenatal supplementation with Ω-3 (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 
(LCPUFA) reduces the incidence of allergic disease characterized by an immunoglobulin 
E (IgE) response. We aimed to determine whether protective effects were evident in the 
6-year-old offspring of women supplemented with n-3 rich fish oil during pregnancy.
METHODS: Six-year follow-up of children (n = 706) with a family history of allergic disease 
from the Docosahexaenoic Acid to Optimize Mother Infant Outcome (DOMInO) trial. 
Women were randomly allocated to receive n-3 LCPUFA-rich fish oil capsules (800 mg/d 
docosahexaenoic acid DHA and 100mg/d eicosapentaenoic acid) or vegetable oil capsules 
(without n-3 LCPUFA). Allergic disease symptoms including eczema, wheeze, rhinitis, and 
rhino-conjunctivitis, were assessed using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies 
in Childhood questionnaire and sensitization to allergens was measured by skin prick test.
RESULTS: There was no difference in the percentage of children with any IgE-associated 
allergic disease between the n-3 LCPUFA and control groups (116/367 [31.5%] vs 106/336 
[31.5%]; adjusted relative risk, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.33; P = .73). There was 
a reduction in the percentage of children sensitized to house dust mite Dermatophagoides 
farinae (49/367 [13.4%] vs 68/336 [20.3%]; adjusted relative risk, 0.67, 95% confidence 
interval, 0.44–1.00; P = .0495).
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal n-3 LCPUFA supplementation did not reduce IgE-associated allergic 
disease at 6 years of age. Secondary outcomes were suggestive of a protective effect of the 
intervention on the incidence of D. farinae sensitization.

The remarkable increase in allergic 
disease prevalence over the last 
30 years is a significant global 
health problem that contributes 
to deficits in quality of life and, in 
some cases, length of life.1 There is 
a growing body of evidence linking 
the modern diet, particularly the 
balance of dietary fatty acids, to an 
increased risk of allergic disease. 
In many industrialized countries, 
diets are low in Ω-3 (n-3) fatty acids 
and contain an overabundance of 
Ω-6 (n-6) fatty acids because of 
increased consumption of linoleic 
acid (18:2, n-6)-rich vegetable oils 
and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4, 
n-6) from meat. Diets high in n-6 
polyunsaturated fatty acids compete 
with n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (LCPUFA) for 
incorporation into cells, giving rise to 
a predominance of AA in tissues. AA 
is the substrate required to produce 
2-series prostaglandins and 4-series 
leukotrienes, both of which are highly 
active mediators of inflammation 
and play a major role in allergic 
inflammation.2 Conversely, diets high 
in n-3 LCPUFA (from fatty fish and 
fish oils) increase cell membrane 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 
n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA; 20:5 n-3), inhibiting synthesis 
of inflammatory AA, which results 
in a reduction in prostaglandin E 
synthesis and inhibition of cytokine 
and immunoglobulin E (IgE) 
production associated with allergies.3 
There is increasing evidence to 
describe the plausible biological 
mechanisms of prenatal n-3 LCPUFA 
supplementation and the potential 
modulation of the development 
of IgE-associated allergic disease 
in offspring with a genetic risk.4–8 
Several observational studies have 
reported protective associations 
between increased fish intake in 
pregnancy and allergic disease 
symptoms in offspring from infancy 
to 6 years of age.9–14 However, these 
observational studies are unable to 
establish causality because of the 
difficulty in adjusting for complex 
confounding factors.15 Randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) of n-3 
LCPUFA supplementation during 
pregnancy have reported protective 
effects; however, apart from 1 
16-year registry based follow-up, 
16 
all reported allergic disease outcomes 
are in early childhood (between 
1 and 3 years of age).7, 
8, 
17–20 In 
addition, the small sample size of a 
number of RCTs7, 
8, 
19, 
20 introduces 
bias and a degree of uncertainty 
regarding results. A recent systematic 
review evaluating the overall body 
of literature on the effects of n-3 
LCPUFA intake during pregnancy 
concludes that further evidence from 
well-powered, high-quality trials 
are essential to establish benefits.21 
Our study was specifically designed 
to assess the effect of prenatal n-3 
LCPUFA supplementation on the 
incidence of IgE-associated allergic 
disease at 6 years of age, when 
respiratory symptoms become more 
prevalent.
METHODS
This is a 6-year follow-up study 
of children born to mothers who 
participated in the double-blind DHA 
to Optimize Mother Infant Outcome 
(DOMInO) RCT (Australian New 
Zealand Clinical Trial Registration 
Number 12605000569606).22 Full 
details of the DOMInO trial and entry 
into the nested allergy cohort have 
been previously published.17, 
18 In 
brief, women <21 weeks’ gestation 
with a singleton pregnancy were 
enrolled during their antenatal 
clinic visit and randomly allocated 
to either treatment or control 
group through a computer-driven 
telephone randomization service, 
stratified by center and parity (first 
birth versus subsequent births).
Women were asked to consume 
capsules containing either 500 mg of 
fish oil concentrate, providing ∼800 
mg/day DHA and 100 mg/day EPA 
(Intervention), or 500 mg vegetable 
oil capsules from 21 weeks’ gestation 
until delivery (Incromega 500 TG, 
Croda Chemicals, East Yorkshire, 
England). The vegetable oil capsules 
contained a blend of 3 nongenetically 
modified oils (grapeseed, sunflower, 
and palm) in equal proportions. 
This blend of oils was designed 
to match the polyunsaturated, 
monounsaturated, and saturated 
fatty acid profile of the average 
Australian diet.23 All capsules were 
similar in size, shape, and color, and 
neither the women nor research 
staff was aware of the treatment 
allocated. Women were eligible to 
enroll in a nested childhood allergy 
follow-up if their unborn child had 
a family history of allergic disease 
(mother, father, or sibling with 
a history of medically diagnosed 
eczema, asthma, or hay fever). 
Before the child’s sixth birthday, 
families who had taken part in an 
early childhood allergy follow-up17, 
18 
were mailed an invitation to take 
part in a 6-year allergy assessment 
(Australian New Zealand Clinical 
Trial Registration Number 
12615000498594). Assessments 
were completed at 2 South Australian 
centers, the Women’s & Children’s 
Hospital and Flinders Medical Centre. 
Approval for this study was granted 
by the Women’s & Children’s Health 
Network and the Southern Adelaide 
Clinical Human Research Ethics 
Committees.
Allergic Disease Outcome 
Assessments and Defi
 nitions
The primary outcome of the 6-year 
allergy follow-up was the incidence of 
allergic disease symptoms (eczema, 
wheeze, rhinitis, rhino-conjunctivitis) 
with a positive skin prick test (SPT) 
to ≥1 allergen extracts (sensitization) 
at 6 years of age (referred to as 
atopic eczema, IgE-associated 
wheeze, allergic rhinitis, and allergic 
rhino-conjunctivitis from this point 
forward).24 Children attended a 
clinic appointment conducted by 1 
of 4 experienced research nurses 
specifically trained in pediatric 
SPT procedures. Quality assurance

reviews of the SPT technique were 
conducted every 6 months by 1 of the 
investigators (K.P.B.). Sensitization 
(IgE response) was defined as a 
positive SPT with a weal size ≥3 mm 
greater than the negative control 
to at least 1 allergen extract. The 
allergen extract panel consisted of 
3 common foods (hen’s egg, peanut, 
and cashew) and 7 common airborne 
allergens (ryegrass pollen, olive 
tree pollen, Alternaria tenuis, cat, 
dog, and 2 species of house dust 
mite [HDM], Dermatophagoides 
pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides 
farinae) (Laboratoire Stallergenes, 
de Tocqueville, France). Glycerol 
and histamine phosphate was 
used for the positive control and 
the negative control consisted of 
saline (Hollister-Stier, Spokane, 
WA). The same research nurses 
administered the International 
Study of Asthma and Allergies in 
Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire (for 
6–7 year olds) to record symptoms 
of allergic disease.25 The validated 
ISAAC questionnaire consists of 3 
modules containing symptom based 
“core” questions used to assess 
cardinal symptoms and severity of 
eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis/rhino-
conjunctivitis for a period covering 
the previous 12 months. ISAAC 
questionnaire modules also include 
parent-reported disease “labels” or 
diagnoses (eg, “Has your child ever 
had asthma?”; “Has your child ever 
had eczema?”; “Has your child ever 
had hay fever?”).26 Atopic eczema 
was defined as the presence of a 
chronic, itchy rash distributed to the 
facial, flexural, or extensor surface 
of the skin with sensitization to at 
least 1 of the allergens assessed. 
IgE-associated wheeze was defined 
as a history of wheezing and/or 
whistling in the chest within the 
past 12 months with sensitization 
to at least 1 of the aeroallergens 
tested. Allergic rhinitis was defined 
as a history of sneezing or a runny 
or blocked nose (in the absence of 
cold or flu) in the past 12 months 
along with sensitization to at least 
1 of the aeroallergens tested. If 
symptoms of itchy watery eyes 
were also present within the past 12 
months, this was defined as allergic 
rhino-conjunctivitis.
If a child was unable to attend a 
clinic appointment, questionnaires 
were either posted or e-mailed 
to the family or administered 
to the caregiver of the child by 
telephone. Data were collected on 
postrandomization characteristics 
of the child, including schooling, 
home environment, physical activity, 
environment, sociodemographic 
characteristics, and diet. Dietary 
information collected on the number 
of fish meals in the last month 
or the number of fortified foods 
in the last month was obtained 
via an interviewer-administered 
questionnaire.
Sample Size and Satistical Analysis
A total of 706 children were enrolled 
in the nested allergy follow-up of 
the DOMInO trial (368 in the n-3 
LCPUFA group and 338 in the control 
group). This sample size provided 
95% power to detect a 40% relative 
reduction in the symptoms of atopic 
disease at 6 years of age from 30% 
to 18% (α = 0.05, two-sided). It 
was estimated that 30% of children 
in the placebo group would have 
allergies, which was conservative 
given that this follow-up study 
includes children with both single 
and double familial risk. Similarly, 
the postulated effect size of a 
40% relative reduction in allergic 
disease was modest and realistic 
compared with the 67% and 59% 
relative reductions in child allergy 
outcomes reported by Furuhjelm 
et al8 and Olsen et al, 
16 respectively, 
in response to fish oil treatment 
during pregnancy. All analyses 
were performed according to the 
intention to treat principle. Multiple 
imputation, implemented under a 
missing-at-random assumption and 
performed separately by randomized 
group using chained equations, 
27 
was used to address missing 
outcome data. Imputation models 
included covariates prespecified for 
adjustment and auxiliary variables 
associated with the outcomes. 
Following analysis of the 100 
multiply imputed datasets, individual 
treatment effect estimates were 
combined using Rubin's rules.28 
The primary analysis was based 
on imputed data and included all 
families that consented to participate 
in the allergy follow-up, excluding 
missing data due to 2 deaths in the 
control group and 1 death in the n-3 
LCPUFA group. A range of sensitivity 
analyses were also performed for 
the primary outcome assuming that 
data were missing not at random 
(Supplemental Information). All 
analyses were adjusted for the 
stratification variables of center 
and parity, as well as the baseline 
characteristic variables of infant 
gender and maternal history of 
allergic disease. To address each 
hypothesis, both unadjusted and 
adjusted analyses were performed, 
with the adjusted analyses 
considered primary. Binary outcomes 
were analyzed using log binomial 
regression models, with treatment 
effects expressed as relative risks 
(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs). For each outcome variable, 
statistical significance was assessed 
at the 0.05 level using a two-sided 
comparative test of treatment effect. 
All analyses were performed by using 
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC) and Stata Release 13 (Stata 
Corp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
The trial profile of the 6-year allergy 
follow-up cohort is shown in Fig 1. 
Following the exclusion of deaths and 
withdrawals from the original early 
childhood allergy cohort (n = 706), 
a total of 668 children were eligible 
and invited to participate in the 
6-year follow up. Enrollment began 
on April 12, 2012, and data collection 
3

Downloaded from 
  
BEST et al 
was completed on August 29, 2014. 
A total of 603 of 668 (90.2%) of 
the available cohort completed a 
6-year allergy assessment (85.4% 
of early childhood allergy cohort), 
with 485 children undergoing SPT to 
determine sensitization status.
Participant Characteristics
Characteristics of the families 
consenting to childhood allergy 
follow-up were similar between the 
groups and have been previously 
reported.18 In brief, mean maternal 
age at trial entry was 29.6 years 
(SD, 5.7 years), and 13.0% of the 
participating mothers smoked during 
pregnancy. All unborn children had 
at least 1 first-degree relative with 
a history of medically diagnosed 
allergic disease; there was a history 
of maternal allergic disease for 70%, 
paternal disease for 54%, and allergic 
disease for both parents for 29% of 
the participants. A total of 39.8% 
were first-born children (parity 
0), and 47.7% were boys. Adverse 
events, defined as hospitalization 
>24 hours, were recorded, and there 
were no differences between the 
groups (6.4% vs 6.9%). As previously 
reported, 
18 compliance with the 
intervention was good with 77% of 
mothers in the n-3 LCPUFA group 
and 80% of mothers in the control 
group reporting that they had missed 
0 to 3 capsules per week (from a 
total of 21 capsules per week) at 28 
weeks’ gestation. DHA concentration 
in the plasma phospholipids of cord 
blood from women in the high-DHA 
group was greater than in the control 
(median, 7.22% vs 6.09% total 
phospholipid fatty acids, P < .001). 
Fewer than 2% of mothers in each 
group chose not to take any capsules. 
More mothers in the control group 
(15.2%) versus the n-3 LCPUFA 
group (9.9%) sought unblinding of 
their treatment allocation before 
the 6- year assessment (P = .03). 
Postrandomization characteristics 
at 6 years of age, including parental 
education, employment, and 
Socioeconomic Index for Area, 
29 were 
comparable between the groups 
(data not presented). Environmental, 
dietary, and anthropometric 
characteristics of the child at 6 years 
of age are shown in Table 1. There 
were no statistically significant 
differences between the groups.
Allergic Disease Outcomes
We found no difference in the 
composite primary outcome of 
incidence of IgE-associated allergic 
disease symptoms (eczema, wheeze, 
or rhinitis), with sensitization at 
6 years of age, between the n-3 
LCPUFA and control groups (31.48% 
[116/367] vs 31.46% [106/336]; 
adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.04; 
95% CI, 0.82–1.33, P = .73; Table 2). 
The overall incidence of “any eczema” 
at 6 years of age was 15.89%, 
with 10.27% cases identified as 
atopic (positive SPT). There was no 
difference between the n-3 LCPUFA 
and control groups in the percentage 
of children with atopic eczema 
symptoms (9.90% vs 10.64%; aRR, 
0.95; 95% CI, 0.59–1.53; P = .83) or 
parent-report of "Has your child ever 
had eczema?" (29.42% vs 34.24%; 
aRR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.69–1.10; P = 
0.25; Table 2). The overall incidence 
of wheeze with sensitization at 6 
years of age was 15.0%. There was no 
difference between the n-3 LCPUFA 
and control groups in the percentage 
of children with IgE-associated 
wheeze (16.36% vs 13.53%; aRR, 
1.24; 95% CI, 0.83–1.85; P = .30) or 
parent-report of "Has your child ever 
had asthma?" (21.41% vs 21.74%; 
aRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.75–1.37; 
P = .92; Table 2). The most common 
allergic disease symptom at 6 years 
of age was rhinitis, affecting a total of 
31.50% of the participating children. 
There was no difference in allergic

rhinitis (20.39% vs 21.29%; aRR, 
0.98; 95% CI, 0.72–1.35; P = 0.92) or 
allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (12.72% 
vs 11.49%; aRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 
0.72–1.73; P = .61) between the n-3 
LCPUFA and control groups. There 
was a nonsignificant 23% reduction 
in the incidence of parent-report of 
"Has your child ever had hay fever?" 
in the n-3 LCPUFA group (22.05% 
vs 29.05%; aRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 
0.59–1.01; P = 0.06; Table 2).
Sensitization Outcomes
Analysis of overall allergen 
sensitization showed no difference 
between the n-3 LCPUFA and control 
groups in the percentage of children 
sensitized to at least 1 allergen 
extract (50.49% vs 48.61%; aRR, 
1.04; 95% CI, 0.90–1.28; P = .43; 
Table 3). There was no difference 
between the n-3 LCPUFA and control 
groups on sensitization to individual 
allergen extracts: hen’s egg, peanut, 
cashew, ryegrass pollen, olive tree 
pollen, Alternaria tenuis, cat, dog, 
and D. pteronyssinus. There was, 
however, a significant reduction in 
the percentage of children sensitized 
to HDM (D. farina) in the n-3 LCPUFA 
group (13.42% vs 20.30%; aRR, 0.67; 
95% CI, 0.44–1.00; P = .0495; 
Table 3).
DISCUSSION
This 6-year allergy follow-up of 
children at hereditary risk of allergic 
disease was designed to determine 
the effect of prenatal n-3 LCPUFA 
supplementation on outcomes of 
IgE-associated allergic disease 
in the early school-age child. Our 
results show that a maternal dose 
of 900mg of n-3 LCPUFA per day 
during pregnancy had no effect on 
the composite primary outcome 
of eczema, wheeze, rhinitis, or 
rhino-conjunctivitis with allergen 
sensitization at 6 years of age. 
Analyses of secondary outcomes 
show a significant reduction in 
sensitization to HDM (D. farinae)

only. The overall incidence of IgE-
associated disease at 6 years of age 
was higher than that reported in this 
cohort of children at 1 and 3 years of 
age17, 
18 and other RCTs of prenatal 
n-3 LCPUFA supplementation for 
children at high hereditary risk of 
allergy7, 
8, 
20. This increased incidence 
is most likely due to the advancing 
age of the child when assessed and 
atopic march progression. A total 
of 31.5% children were identified 
as having at least 1 symptom of 
either atopic eczema, IgE-associated 
wheeze, or allergic rhinitis/
rhino-conjunctivitis. Although 
more children reported allergic 
disease symptoms, there appears 
to be a dilution of the protective 
effects on sensitization seen in 
RCTs that assessed symptoms of 
atopic disease in infancy.7, 
8, 
18 Our 
results did not support findings 
from cohort studies observing an 
association with increased maternal 
dietary n-3 LCPUFA (mainly from 
fish) intake during pregnancy and 
reduced incidence of asthma or 
wheeze9, 
11, 
12, 
30 at 5 to 7 years of age 
and hay fever at 5 years of age.31 
There was some comparability, 
however, with 2 studies reporting 
a reduction in sensitization to 
HDM at 6 years of age.9, 
12 We 
used 2 common species of HDM in 
our SPT allergen extract panel, D. 
farinae and D. pteronyssinus, yet 
there was a significant reduction 
in sensitization to D. farinae only. 
This inconsistency in results is 
unexplainable, and the possibility of 
a chance finding cannot be excluded. 
Although no significant effects of the 
intervention was seen in any of the 
other allergen extracts tested, there 
was a reduction in sensitization

to peanuts and cashews in the n-3 
LCPUFA group. Although numbers 
are low and these findings may be 
due to chance, this reduction in 
sensitization to food allergens at 6 
years of age is consistent with the 
reduced incidence of sensitization to 
food allergens seen at 1 year of age 
(egg) and may merit further targeted 
research.
The DOMInO Trial22 is the largest 
RCT of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation 
during pregnancy with high 
retention and completion of follow 
up at 6 years. As demonstrated 
by the equanimity in descriptive 
characteristics of participants at 
6 years of age, the integrity of the 
randomization was maintained. 
An unexpected finding in our 
study was the observation that 
more mothers in the control group 
versus the n-3 LCPUFA group 
had sought unblinding (15.2% vs 
9.9%) before the 6-year allergy 
follow-up assessment. Unblinding 
was performed by an independent 
data management center to 
ensure all research staff remained 
blinded. Because this was a 
postrandomization variable, it could 
not be adjusted for in the statistical 
analyses when estimating treatment 
effects; however, there was no 
relationship between blinded and 
unblinded families who attended 
assessments or between the 
postrandomization characteristics of 
blinded versus unblinded families. 
Another potential limitation of our 
study (previously reported18) was 
the observation of a difference 
between the groups in infant feeding 
postrandomization. More infants in 
the n-3 LCPUFA group were initially 
breastfed (348/362 [96%]) than in 
the control group (303/333 [91%]). 
However, three-quarters of the 
infants were fed cows’ milk–based 
formula before 6 months of age, 
with exploratory analyses showing 
no relation between the initiation of 
breast feeding and early outcomes 
of allergic disease at 12 months. 
Analysis of ISAAC environmental 
questionnaire diet variables32 at 6 
years (data not included) showed 
no difference between the groups 
in child diet. It is unlikely child diet, 
including the small imbalance in 
early infant feeding, would influence 
the outcomes of the trial.
CONCLUSIONS
This 6-year allergy follow-up 
study was designed to resolve 
uncertainties surrounding the 
use of maternal n-3 LCPUFA 
supplementation during pregnancy 
as an allergic disease preventative 
strategy. Although suggestive 
of a reduction in sensitization, 
our results conclude that there 
is no significant long-term 
benefit of prenatal n-3 LCPUFA 
supplementation for the incidence 
of allergy in offspring with a familial 
history of disease. One could 
question whether supplementation 
from conception (or preconception) 
and continuation throughout 
breastfeeding would augment 
effects, and this may warrant further 
investigation.
