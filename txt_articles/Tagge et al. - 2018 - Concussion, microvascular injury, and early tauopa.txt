The mechanisms underpinning concussion, traumatic brain injury, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and the relationships
between these disorders, are poorly understood. We examined post-mortem brains from teenage athletes in the acute-subacute
period after mild closed-head impact injury and found astrocytosis, myelinated axonopathy, microvascular injury, perivascular
neuroinflammation, and phosphorylated tau protein pathology. To investigate causal mechanisms, we developed a mouse model of
lateral closed-head impact injury that uses momentum transfer to induce traumatic head acceleration. Unanaesthetized mice
subjected to unilateral impact exhibited abrupt onset, transient course, and rapid resolution of a concussion-like syndrome
characterized by altered arousal, contralateral hemiparesis, truncal ataxia, locomotor and balance impairments, and neurobeha-
vioural deficits. Experimental impact injury was associated with axonopathy, blood–brain barrier disruption, astrocytosis, micro-
gliosis (with activation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells, TREM2), monocyte infiltration, and phosphorylated
tauopathy in cerebral cortex ipsilateral and subjacent to impact. Phosphorylated tauopathy was detected in ipsilateral axons by
24 h, bilateral axons and soma by 2 weeks, and distant cortex bilaterally at 5.5 months post-injury. Impact pathologies co-localized
with serum albumin extravasation in the brain that was diagnostically detectable in living mice by dynamic contrast-enhanced
MRI. These pathologies were also accompanied by early, persistent, and bilateral impairment in axonal conduction velocity in the
hippocampus and defective long-term potentiation of synaptic neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex, brain regions
distant from acute brain injury. Surprisingly, acute neurobehavioural deficits at the time of injury did not correlate with blood–
brain barrier disruption, microgliosis, neuroinflammation, phosphorylated tauopathy, or electrophysiological dysfunction.
Furthermore, concussion-like deficits were observed after impact injury, but not after blast exposure under experimental conditions
matched for head kinematics. Computational modelling showed that impact injury generated focal point loading on the head and
seven-fold greater peak shear stress in the brain compared to blast exposure. Moreover, intracerebral shear stress peaked before
onset of gross head motion. By comparison, blast induced distributed force loading on the head and diffuse, lower magnitude shear

 stress in the brain. We conclude that force loading mechanics at the time of injury shape acute neurobehavioural responses,
structural brain damage, and neuropathological sequelae triggered by neurotrauma. These results indicate that closed-head
impact injuries, independent of concussive signs, can induce traumatic brain injury as well as early pathologies and functional
sequelae associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. These results also shed light on the origins of concussion and rela-
tionship to traumatic brain injury and its aftermath.

Introduction
Closed-head impact injuries are a common cause of con-
cussion (Ropper and Gorson, 2007; Harmon et al., 2013;
McCrory et al., 2013; Sharp and Jenkins, 2015) and trau-
matic brain injury (TBI) (Langlois et al., 2006; Menon
et al., 2010; Jordan, 2013; Sharp et al., 2016). These inju-
ries
are
also
associated
with
post-traumatic
sequelae
(Guskiewicz et al., 2007a; Ropper and Gorson, 2007;
Blennow et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2013b), including late-
life cognitive decline, neurodegenerative disease, and de-
mentia (Guskiewicz et al., 2005; Gavett et al., 2010;
Lehman et al., 2012; Stamm et al., 2015; Stein et al.,
2015b; Montenigro et al., 2017). Emerging evidence impli-
cates
repetitive
neurotrauma,
including
sports-related
closed-head impact injuries, as a major risk factor for
later development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy
(CTE), a progressive tau protein neurodegenerative disease
(McKee et al., 2013, 2016; Mez et al., 2017).
An association between sports-related head injuries and
chronic neuropsychiatric disturbances was first described
by Martland as the ‘punch-drunk syndrome’ of pugilists
(Martland, 1928). Parker and later Millspauch variously
dubbed the same condition ‘traumatic encephalopathy’
(Parker,
1934)
and ‘dementia
pugilistica’
(Millspaugh,
1937). Critchley proposed the name ‘chronic traumatic en-
cephalopathy’ (Critchley, 1949, 1957) to capture the pro-
gressive long-term nature of the disorder. CTE is now
recognized as a distinct tau protein neurodegenerative dis-
ease that is neuropathologically defined by perivascular

 accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein in
the depths of cortical sulci (McKee et al., 2016). Based on
the presence of this distinctive lesion, CTE has been con-
firmed in post-mortem brains from individuals across a
wide age range, including teenagers and young adults
(McKee et al., 2013; Bieniek et al., 2015; Mez et al.,
2017). Modern case series have documented CTE neuro-
pathology in contact sport athletes with repetitive concus-
sive and subconcussive head injuries (Omalu et al., 2005;
McKee et al., 2009, 2013; Mez et al., 2017) as well as
military
veterans
with
combat-related
blast
exposure
(Omalu et al., 2011; Goldstein et al., 2012; Shively et al.,
2016). In addition, deep sulcal tau pathology has been re-
ported in long-term TBI survivors of single-episode neuro-
trauma (Johnson et al., 2012). While the preponderance of
reported CTE cases include a history of repeated mild TBI,
a subset (�20% of cases) is notable for absence of prior
concussion (McKee et al., 2014; Bieniek et al., 2015; Stein
et al., 2015a). This observation suggests that repeated head
injuries, even in the absence of frank concussion, may
induce brain pathologies associated with CTE.
Mild forms of TBI (Kay et al., 1993; Carroll et al., 2004;
Ruff et al., 2009; Menon et al., 2010; Katz et al., 2014;
Kristman et al., 2014) account for the majority of head
injuries worldwide (Roozenbeek et al., 2013; Bazarian
et al., 2014; Gardner and Yaffe, 2015). While the patho-
genesis of CTE is unknown, emerging evidence points to a
putative
causal
association
with
neurotrauma
(Omalu
et al., 2005, 2011; McKee et al., 2009, 2013; Goldstein
et al., 2014; Montenigro et al., 2017). Recent research
has shown that contact sport athletes with repetitive head
injuries and military veterans with blast exposure demon-
strate similar patterns of post-mortem CTE neuropathology
(Omalu et al., 2005, 2011; McKee et al., 2009, 2010,
2013; Goldstein et al., 2012; Shively et al., 2016). These
observations
support
the hypothesis
that
neurotrauma
induced by different injuries triggers common pathogenic
mechanisms that induce convergent CTE neuropathology.
This hypothesis is further supported by research showing
that laboratory mice exposed to experimental blast develop
progressive brain pathologies and functional sequelae that
resemble CTE in humans (Goldstein et al., 2012; Huber
et al., 2013; Kondo et al., 2015). This experimental work
implicates traumatic head motion as a plausible mechanism
underpinning the observed similarities in human CTE brain
pathology despite differences in the mechanisms of injury.
Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that biomechanical
and pathophysiological determinants underpinning blast
neurotrauma would also drive early CTE neuropathology
after closed-head impact injury (Goldstein et al., 2012;
Ghajari et al., 2017). Furthermore, emerging clinical evi-
dence (Guskiewicz et al., 2007b; Bazarian et al., 2014;
Davenport et al., 2014; Talavage et al., 2014) and clinico-
pathological correlation analysis (McKee et al., 2013,
2014, 2015; Stein et al., 2015a; Mez et al., 2017) suggest
that TBI and CTE pathobiology may be independent of the
mechanisms that trigger concussion. These observations
suggest that repeat head injuries, even in the absence of
concussion, may induce TBI and CTE brain pathologies.
Despite growing awareness of links between head injury
and CTE, the substrates and mechanisms underpinning this
association, and relationships to concussion and TBI,
remain largely unknown and matters of significant contro-
versy. Most notably, there is insufficient knowledge regard-
ing changes in brain structure and function during the
acute-subacute period after head injury that may represent
the earliest antecedent pathologies of CTE.
Here we developed a novel mouse model of lateral
closed-head concussive impact injury that produces head
kinematics matched to a companion blast neurotrauma
mouse
model (Goldstein
et al.,
2012; Kondo et
al.,
2015). We deployed both animal models to test the
hypothesis that neurotrauma induced by different injury
mechanisms
triggers
common
pathogenic
mechanisms
and
convergent
CTE
neuropathology.
We
used
non-
anaesthetized mice to facilitate comparative investigation
of acute neurobehavioural responses to different types of
neurotrauma.
We
conducted
biomechanical
modelling,
computational simulations, and human clinicopathological
correlation analysis to investigate mechanisms leading to
observed differences in acute neurobehavioural responses
and similarities in chronic brain pathologies induced by
neurotrauma.

Experimental closed-head concussive
impact injury
A compressed gas-driven closed-head impact injury system
(Supplementary Fig. 1A) was custom designed and fabricated
at the Boston University Neurotrauma Laboratory, Boston
University School of Medicine, for use in awake, unanaesthetized
(anaesthesia-naı
¨ve) young adult male C57BL/6 mice. The instru-
ment uses a momentum transfer mechanism to deliver a scalable
closed-head impact that results in traumatic head acceleration
without gross skull deformation. As implemented in this study,
left-lateral impact produced right-lateral flexion of the cervical
spine and rightward translation of the head in the horizontal
plane of motion (Fig. 2A and B). Mouse positioning and instru-
ment parameters were set such that head kinematics produced by
experimental impact were comparable to our blast neurotrauma
mouse model (Supplementary Table 2) (Goldstein et al., 2012;
Kondo et al., 2015). Instrument data were acquired and pro-
cessed in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Animal experi-
ments were conducted without anaesthesia to: maximize clinical
relevance and animal model fidelity with respect to human head
injuries and facilitate accurate assessment of acute neurobeha-
vioural responses post-injury (Huang et al., 2016); maintain
physiological responsivity of central receptors, channels, and
neurotransmitter systems; and prevent anaesthetic modulation
of neuroinflammation and tau protein phosphorylation (Planel
et al., 2007; Luh et al., 2011; Wojnarowicz et al., 2017).
Unanaesthetized mice were pretreated with a non-sedating dose
of the analgesic buprenorphine (0.2mg/kg, i.p.), placed in a mod-
ified DecapiCone (Braintree Scientific, Inc.), and secured in the
instrument in the prone position. The head and cervical spine
were not restrained during experimental exposure. The single-
repeat design incorporated two impacts separated by 15min to
mimic a minimal repeat head injury as commonly occurs during
a single session of contact sport play or practice (Crisco et al.,
2010). Experimental head injury was compatible with 100%
survival without evidence of skull fracture, spinal trauma, per-
sistent gross neurological impairment, or post-traumatic apnoea.
See Supplementary material for additional details.
High-speed videography kinematic
analysis
High-speed videography was conducted with a FASTCAM SA5
camera (Photron USA, Inc., Tech Imaging) operated at 10ms
frame capture rate (100000 fps; 100kHz). Videographic records
were reassembled and processed in MATLAB (MathWorks). A
2kHz second-order, zero-phase Butterworth filter was applied to
position-time data. First, second, and third derivatives (velocity,
acceleration, jerk) were calculated from the filtered position
versus time vectors using discrete differentiation.
Acute neurobehavioural response
test battery
The test battery is a quantitative multidimensional evaluation
protocol for objective assessment of transient neurobehavioural
responses to experimental neurotrauma in awake, unanaesthe-
tized (anaesthesia-naı
¨ve) mice (Supplementary Fig. 1B). A com-
posite score (0–15) was derived by summing component scores
on each of three subtests: open-field, inverted wire mesh, beam
walk. Each subtest was conducted over 30 s and scored on a
six-point scale (0–5) based on standardized metrics that capture
graded
neurobehavioural
deficits

for
each
test
(Supplementary Fig. 1B). A composite score of 15 indicated
unimpaired performance in all three subtests. Lower scores

 indicate increasing impairment (mild: 14–10; moderate: 9–5;
severe: 4–0). Testing was conducted before exposure (pre-
injury baseline), 2 min after exposure (post-injury), and after
3 h rest period (recovery). See Supplementary material for add-
itional details.
Tau protein immunoblot analysis
Quantitative phosphorylated and total tau protein immunoblot
analyses were conducted on homogenates of left and right
hemisected brains from perfused mice sacrificed 2 weeks
after impact injury or sham (no injury) control exposure.
Snap-frozen hemisected brains were thawed, resuspended in
0.7 ml of protease-phosphatase inhibitor buffer, and homoge-
nized. Protein concentrations were normalized and equal
sample volumes analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(Goldstein et al., 2012). Immunoblot detection was conducted
with monoclonal antibody CP-13 (courtesy of Peter Davies,
Albert Einstein College of Medicine) directed against phos-
phorylated tau protein (pS202) and rabbit polyclonal antibody
Tau 5 (Cell Signaling) directed against total tau protein
(bovine tau, aa210-241). Triplicate measurements were ana-
lysed with ImageJ software.
Blood–brain barrier functional
analysis
Mice were injected with Evans blue dye (4 ml/kg, i.p.) 1 h
before impact injury or sham (no-injury) control exposure.
Following sacrifice, mice were transcardially perfused with
saline. Gross pathology was documented by photomacroscopy
with a Nikon D5200 digital camera under cross-polarized
white light illumination. Brains were sectioned (2 mm) coron-
ally and imaged with an IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Imaging
System (PerkinElmer). Fluorescence images were acquired at
0.5 s exposure with a 535 nm excitation filter and the follow-
ing emission filters: 580, 600, 620, 640, 660, 680, 700, 720,
740, 760, 780, 800, 820, 840 nm. Non-specific autofluores-
cence was removed by spectral unmixing (Living Image soft-
ware, PerkinElmer). Calibrated images were masked in Adobe
Photoshop and analysed with a custom MATLAB script
(MathWorks, Natick, MA) was used to process pixel data.
Evans blue-specific fluorescence signal intensity was normal-
ized to pixel area for each masked region. Percentage of
pixels demonstrating Evans blue-specific fluorescence was cal-
culated by thresholding to the mean 95th percentile of all
counts in control sections. Total percentage of Evans blue ex-
travasation pixels for each mouse brain was calculated by
summation across all slices. Grouping by Evans blue extrava-
sation was performed using a Gaussian mixture model.
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
In vivo T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
were performed using a 11.7 T MRI (Bruker) at the Boston
University High-Field NMR Imaging Core Facility. Mice
were anaesthetized with 0.5–2.5% isoflurane during imaging
with respiration rate monitoring. For the dynamic sequence,
0.1
ml
gadofosveset
trisodium
(0.25 mmol/ml;
Lantheus
Medical Imaging) was administered by tail vein catheter.
Five baseline scans were obtained before injection. After
injection, 145 scans were acquired over 31 min. Post-acquisi-
tion image analysis was performed using customized MATLAB
scripts (MathWorks). See Supplementary material for add-
itional details.
Metallomic imaging mass spectro-
metry brain mapping
Ultra-trace elemental and isotopic analytical brain mapping for
gadolinium (Gd) was performed by laser ablation-assisted
metallomic imaging mass spectrometry (Gd-MIMS) at the
Boston University Center for Biometallomics. A quadrupole
inductively-coupled
plasma
mass
spectrometer
(iCAP-Q,
Thermo Scientific) was custom hyphenated to a Nd-YAG
laser with frequency quadrupling to attain 213 nm output.
Laser pulse duration was 5 ns with a pulse repetition rate of
20 Hz. Spot size was 20 mm and scan speed was 40 mm/s.
Laser-generated
aerosol was transported
from a custom-
designed laminar flow laser ablation cell to the mass spectro-
meter by carrier gas mixture at constant flow rates. Generated
ions were transported by mass flow into the mass spectrometer
and separated according to mass-to-charge ratio. Analytical
calibration was performed with a reference standard (SRM
612,
NIST).
Datasets
were
exported
to
a
customized
MATLAB program (Mathworks) for analytical processing,
quantitation, and 2D analytical mapping.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping
Flow cytometry was performed on single-cell suspensions pre-
pared from homogenized brains (Jay et al., 2015). Briefly, cells
were
separated
on
a
30–70%
Percoll�
gradient
(GE
Healthcare).
Single-cell
suspensions
were
stained
with
a
master mix composed of anti-CD45-APC (1:100; BioLegend),
anti-CD11b-Efluo450 (1:200; eBioscience), anti-Ly-6G-FITC
(1:1000; BioLegend), anti-Ly-6C-PE/Cy7 (1:200; BioLegend),
TREM2-PE (1:100; R&D Systems). Cell populations were
defined
as
inflammatory
cells,
CD45 +;
microglia,
CD45lowCD11b +; and monocytes, CD45highCD11b +Ly-6G–.
Ly-6 C was used to phenotype distinct monocyte subpopula-
tions (Ly-6Chigh, Ly-6Cmiddle, Ly-6Clow). Events were gated on
single cells and CD11b-positive events. Samples with 45000
CD11b-positive events were used for analysis. Fluorescence
Minus One (FMO) was used to assess cells expressing trigger-
ing receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein (TREM2 +).
The percentage of cells from each population was determined

 was mounted on a cutting stage and immediately submerged in
ice-cold cutting solution (200 mM sucrose, 10 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 mM
CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2).
Slices containing the hippocampus or medial prefrontal cortex
(Supplementary Figs. 5A–C) were cut by vibratome at 350 mm
thickness. Slices were transferred to an incubation chamber,
warmed to 32�C for 30 min, and equilibrated in a slice record-
ing chamber at 32�C with continuous perfusion (2 ml/min) of
artificial CSF (10 mM glucose, 126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl,
1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 26 mM
NaHCO3 saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Axonal con-
duction velocity was assessed with two recording electrodes
placed
in
CA1
stratum
alveus
spaced
�200 mm
(Supplementary Fig. 5A). Long-term potentiation (LTP) of syn-
aptic neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex was
assessed with a stimulating electrode placed in mixed inputs
in layer VI and extracellular recording electrode placed as
indicated in Supplementary Fig. 5C. See Supplementary mater-
ial for additional details.
Mouse headform pressure
measurements
Pressure film measurements were conducted with a mouse
headform consisting of a 15 ml polypropylene vial filled with
10% gelatin. Fuji Prescale� pressure sensitive film (Sensor
Products, Inc.) was fixed flush to the outer surface of the
vial and exposed to a single blast or impact under conditions
identical to the in vivo experiments. Control films were fixed
to identical headforms and placed in the experimental instru-
ments without impact or blast exposure. Exposed films were
digitally scanned, imported into MATLAB (MathWorks), and
converted to monochrome luminescence images (NTSC stand-
ard,
RGB
colour:
Y = 0.2989*R + 0.5870*G + 0.1140*B,
equivalent to rgb2gray MatLab). A 1000 � 500 pixel bound-
ary was applied to all images. Histogram analysis was used to
identify the lower threshold of pixel values attributable to
noise and subtracted from all images. The sum of noise-cor-
rected pixels in the bounded region was measured and
recorded.
Computational simulations
Computational simulations were conducted using ALE3D
(Noble et al., 2017) in explicit dynamics mode with the solid
regions held Lagrangian and the gas regions allowed to advect
and relax to prevent mesh entanglement. All elements for the
impact simulations were 3D linear reduced integration elem-
ents, whereas the blast simulations used 2D axisymmetric
reduced integration elements. In all simulations, materials
were initialized to 295 K, and 1 bar ambient pressure, except
gas pressure in the blast tube driver chamber. All materials
were initially at rest, except for the impact rod. Gases were
described by gamma-law gas equations of state (� = 1.4, air;
1.67, He). Predicted blast pressure histories were validated
against
analytic
solutions
for
shock
tube
dynamics
(Liepmann and Roshko, 1957). The skull was modelled as
an isotropic linear elastic hollow sphere with 1.08 cm outer
diameter,
0.02 cm
thickness,
four
radial
zones
and
2.5�
zoning. CSF was modelled as a water layer 0.02 cm thick
with four radial zones. The brain was modelled as a 0.5-cm
radius viscoelastic sphere, with 30 radial zones. Material prop-
erties for the skull and brain were incorporated as previously
described (Moss et al., 2009). The gas zones surrounding the
skull were ratio-zoned, increasing from 0.03 cm thickness at
the skull, to a fixed value of 0.2 cm thickness 4 cm from the
skull centre. The calculated Reynolds number for non-steady
airflow in the blast simulation was �105, indicating a turbu-
lent flow field, that was accounted for in the simulation. The
sled and impact rod were modelled as linear elastic solids. See
Supplementary material for additional details.
Statistical analyses
Linear mixed-effects regression analyses were used to evaluate
group differences and test for correlation with composite and
subtest scores on the acute neurobehavioural response test bat-
tery. Linear mixed-effects regression analyses were also used to
determine group differences of Evans blue extravasation (dye-
specific fluorescence signal intensity) in post-mortem brains. For
each linear mixed-effects regression analysis, we allowed for
outcome-specific fixed effects and subject-specific random ef-
fects. Outcomes were correlated using an unstructured covari-
ance
matrix
for
within-subject
correlation.
Mixed
effect
analyses represent more realistic outcome models than using
independent regression models for each outcome while remov-
ing
multiple
comparisons
and
providing
greater
power
(Goldstein, 2011; Gelman et al., 2012). Immunoblot densitom-
etry
and
biochemical
data
were
evaluated
by
two-tailed
Student’s t-test. Flow cytometry data were evaluated by one-
way ANOVA followed by post hoc Student’s t-tests using the
Bonferroni correction. Comparisons of axonal conduction vel-
ocity and LTP magnitude were made using three-way ANOVA.
Spearman’s rank-order coefficient was computed between lost
points on the test battery and end-point metrics (Supplementary
Table
3).
Levels
of
significance:
*P 5 0.05;
**P 5 0.01;
***P 5 0.001; NS = no significant difference. Statistical signifi-
cance was set at an alpha-level of P 5 0.05. Exact P-values are
reported for statistical significance except when P 5 0.0001.

We conducted neuropathological examinations of rare
post-mortem brains obtained from teenage athletes (four
males,
aged
17–18
years;
mean,
17.5
years;
Supplementary Table 1, Cases 1–4) who sustained sports-
related closed-head impact injuries and died in the acute-
subacute period 1 day to 4 months post-injury (Fig. 1A,
C–J, L, M and O–R). We compared these brains to post-
mortem control brains from comparably-aged athletes
(four
males;
aged
17–22
years;
mean,
19.2
years;
Supplementary Table 1, Cases 5–8) without recent head
injury (Fig. 1B, K and N). None of the cases showed

 evidence of skull fracture, subdural haematoma, subarach-
noid haemorrhage, or other evidence of moderate-to-
severe TBI.
We included four cases in the acute-subacute post-TBI
cohort. Case 1, an 18-year-old male high school athlete
(American
football,
baseball,
basketball,
weight-lifting)
who died by suicide from hanging 4.2 months after sustain-
ing a mild closed-head injury while snowboarding. The de-
cedent’s head injury exposure history was notable for
amateur participation in American football (9 years total).
He played fullback and middle linebacker, positions asso-
ciated with frequent high-magnitude head impacts (Crisco
et al., 2011). He sustained 10 concussions, none other than
the last with loss of consciousness. Four months before
death, he sustained a concussion while snowboarding and
briefly lost consciousness (�2 min). He was evaluated at a
local hospital and released without follow-up. After the
injury, he complained of frequent headaches and mental
fogginess. His parents noted increased frustration, emo-
tional lability, verbal hostility, physical aggression, and
school absences. He was clinically evaluated and diagnosed
with post-concussive syndrome. Due to school absences,
school officials did not allow him to participate in his
high school graduation ceremony. The next day, 4.2
months after the snowboarding injury, he hanged himself
in his bedroom. His past medical history was notable for
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that was diagnosed
in the third grade and treated for 1 year with methypheni-
date. He had no history of depression, anxiety, or prior
episodes of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts. The
intact brain (1460 g) was obtained as a fresh specimen
with a post-mortem interval of 1 day. Grossly, the brain
did not show evidence of atrophy, asymmetry, swelling,
cavum septum pellucidum, or contusions.
Case
2,
an
18-year-old
male
high
school
athlete
(American football, rugby, soccer, in-line hockey) who
died suddenly 10 days after the second of two sports-
related head injuries. The decendent’s head injury exposure
history was notable for four sports-related concussions. He
played American football at the amateur level starting at
age 11 and continued intermittently through high school
(3 years total). In his junior and senior year of high
school, he played rugby (amateur then semi-professional
level). One month before death, he sustained a severe con-
cussion during a rugby match that resulted in post-trau-
matic somnolence. Two weeks later he sustained a second
rugby-related head injury that resulted in sideline collapse
and a 2-day hospitalization for clinical observation and
recuperation.
Seven
days
after
hospital
discharge,
he
engaged in light weightlifting after which he collapsed sud-
denly while eating dinner with his family. He was taken to
the hospital where he died from acute cerebral oedema, the
recorded cause of death. Selected brain regions were ob-
tained as fixed sectioned specimens on microscope slides.
The brain weight was 1680 g. The post-mortem interval is
not known.
Case 3, a 17-year-old male high school American football
and lacrosse player who died by suicide from hanging. The
decedent was diagnosed with two sports-related concussions
during life, the last sustained 2 days before death. He was
evaluated in an emergency room after his last head injury (no
reported loss of consciousness) where he was noted to be
confused, could not recall events and circumstances sur-
rounding the injury, and was unable to recite the days of
the week in reverse order. He had no history of depression,
anxiety, mood disorder, impulsivity, suicidal ideation, or
prior suicide attempts. The intact whole brain (1600g) was
obtained as a fresh specimen with a post-mortem interval of
3 days. Grossly, the brain was diffusely swollen without evi-
dence of atrophy, asymmetry, or contusions. A small anterior
cavum septum pellucidum was noted.
Case 4, a 17-year-old male high school American football
player who sustained three sports-related concussions (26
days, 6 days, 1 day) before death from second impact syn-
drome. During the football game in which he sustained a
terminal head injury, he received a hard tackle, landed on
his helmet, and was rendered immobile and unresponsive. A
tonic-clonic seizure ensued. He was intubated and ventilated
on the field, then transferred to a hospital emergency ward.
A CT head scan showed global cerebral oedema without
evidence of haemorrhage. Despite surgical decompression,
cerebral swelling progressed to fatal brain herniation. He
died 1 day after the proximate head injury. The recorded
cause of death was second impact syndrome. The brain
(1450 g) was obtained as coronal tissue sections on glass
slides. The post-mortem interval is not known.
We included four cases in the control athlete cohort. Case
5, a 19-year-old male high school American football player
who died of multiple organ failure and cardiac arrest. The
intact brain (1430g) was obtained as a formalin-fixed tissue
specimen with an unknown post-mortem interval. Grossly,
the brain did not show evidence of atrophy, asymmetry,
herniation, or contusions. Case 6, a 19-year-old male college
hockey player with a history of six concussions who died of a
cardiac arrhythmia. The intact brain (1500g) was obtained as
a formalin-fixed tissue specimen with an unknown post-
mortem interval. Grossly, the brain did not show evidence
of atrophy, asymmetry, or contusions. Case 7, a 17-year-old
male high school American football player who died from
oxycodone overdose. The brain was obtained as formalin-
fixed coronal slabs of available tissue with an unknown
post-mortem interval. A 0.3-cm cavum septum pellucidum
was noted. Case 8, a 22-year-old male former high school
American football player who died by suicide (unknown
mechanism). The decedent’s head injury exposure history
was notable for three remote concussions, one with loss of
consciousness of indeterminate duration, all sustained more
than 7 years before death. He was diagnosed with bipolar
disorder and had two suicide attempts prior to the completed
suicide. The intact whole brain (1630g) was obtained as a
fresh tissue specimen with a 2-day post-mortem interval.
Grossly, the brain did not show evidence of atrophy, asym-
metry, or contusions.

 Microscopic examination of post-mortem brains from
young athletes in the acute-subacute period after sports-
related
head
injury
revealed
diffuse
astrocytosis
with
increased glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in
white matter (Fig. 1A) and surrounding small blood vessels
in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 1I and J); perivascular foci of
hemosiderin-laden
macrophages
indicative
of
resolved
microhaemorrhage (Fig. 1C and D); dystrophic axons with
swellings immunoreactive for amyloid precursor protein
(Fig. 1F–H); perivascular clusters of activated microglia
(Fig. 1L and M) in all four cases. Multifocal axonal
injury was observed diffusely in frontal, temporal, and sub-
cortical white matter. Axonal spheroids and retraction balls
with digestion chambers were noted in the dorsolateral mid-
brain and cerebellar white matter (Case 1) (McKee et al.,
2014). We detected focal phosphorylated tau protein in two
of the four cases, and early-stage CTE in one case. These
cases were notable for perivascular pretangles, neurofibril-
lary tangles, dot neurites, and dystrophic axons immunor-
eactive for phosphorylated tau protein (Fig. 1E and O–R).
Focal cortical lesions demonstrating perivascular accumula-
tion of serum immunoglobulin G (Fig. 1S–U) were detected
in proximity to neighbouring blood vessels of similar calibre
that did not show microvascular pathology (Fig. 1V). These
results are consistent with extravasation and intraparenchy-
mal accumulation of serum proteins secondary to localized
traumatic microvascular injury and focal blood–brain bar-
rier disruption. By contrast, none of the post-mortem brains
from the control group demonstrated evidence of micro-
vascular or axonal injury, astrocytosis, microgliosis, or
phosphorylated tauopathy indicative of CTE or other neu-
rodegenerative disease (Fig. 1B, K and N). None of the
cases, including those with early CTE pathology, showed
evidence of neuropathology associated with Alzheimer’s dis-
ease or other neurodegenerative diseases.
Mechanistic links between
experimental closed-head impact
injury, early CTE pathologies, and
functional sequelae
A novel mouse model of closed-head impact injury
Clinicopathological correlation suggested that impact injury
may, in some cases, trigger early pathologies associated
with CTE. However, causal mechanisms underpinning
this association cannot be established with certainty based
solely on post-mortem neuropathological examination. We
hypothesized that closed-head impact injury is mechanistic-
ally linked to, causally determinative of, and temporally
associated with early CTE brain pathologies.

consistent with the high degree of focality. Other smaller blood vessels (white arrows) are also devoid of perivascular IgG immunoreactivity,

 To test this hypothesis, we developed an experimental
instrument
that
uses
momentum
transfer
to
produce
traumatic head acceleration without gross skull deforma-
tion in awake (anaesthesia-naı
¨ve) mice. Experimental par-
ameters were optimized to match head kinematics in our
companion blast neurotrauma mouse model (Goldstein
et al., 2012; Kondo et al., 2015). The developed instrument
(Supplementary Fig. 1A) was designed for use in una-
naesthetized young adult male mice to model subject vari-
ables, injury conditions, and brain pathology as in the
human cases (Goldstein et al., 2014; Wojnarowicz et al.,
2017). The instrument incorporates a gas-driven momen-
tum transfer mechanism to deliver a lateral closed-head
impact that induces traumatic head acceleration without
gross skull deformation (Fig. 2A and B). The rationale
for this design was to enable evaluation of acute neurobe-
havioural responses and cellular-molecular effects without
confounding interference of systemic anaesthetics (Statler
et al., 2006; Planel et al., 2007, 2008; Fish et al., 2011;
Luh et al., 2011; Whittington et al., 2013; Gao et al.,
2016). Unanaesthetized mice were restrained across the
thorax in the prone position such that the inner pad of
the sled contacted the left temporal-zygomatic region of
the head. Linear translation of the sled resulted in left-lat-
eral closed-head impact, right lateral flexion at the cervical
spine, and traumatic acceleration of the head in the hori-
zontal plane of motion (Fig. 2A and B). Head motion was
assessed by high-speed videography (100 000 fps, 100 kHz).
Sled velocity of 5.1 � 0.2 m/s [mean � standard deviation
(SD)] produced the following head kinematics (mean �
SD,
n = 18):
swing
radius,
30.0 � 2.3 mm;
peak
X-
acceleration,
12.6 � 103 � 3.4 � 103 m/s2;
peak
angular
acceleration, 398.8 � 111.0 krad/s2; peak X-jerk, 5.3 �
107 � 2.5 � 107 m/s3
(Fig.
2C).
Impact-induced
head
kinematics
(n = 18)
were
statistically
indistinguishable
(Bonferroni-corrected two-tailed Student’s t-tests, P 4 0.05)
from head motion produced by experimental blast exposure
(n = 8) at a peak pressure of 72.3 � 2.8 kPag (Goldstein
et al., 2012; Kondo et al., 2015). These results justified
setting the impact instrument sled velocity at 5.0 m/s and
holding
operating
parameters
constant
(Supplementary
Table 2). Experimental impact head injury at this intensity
was compatible with 100% survival without evidence of
skull fracture or deformation; subdural, epidural, or sub-
arachnoid haemorrhage; cervical trauma or spinal cord
injury; post-traumatic apnoea; or persistent gross neuro-
logical impairment.
Closed-head impact injury induces acute
neurobehavioural deficits in unanaesthetized mice
Unanaesthetized mice subjected to unilateral closed-head
impact injury exhibited variable degrees of transient neuro-
behavioural
dysfunction
with
abrupt
onset,
transient
course, and spontaneous recovery (Supplementary Video
1). To objectively assess this transient concussion-like syn-
drome, we developed an acute neurobehavioural response
test
battery
and
standardized
scoring
criteria
(Supplementary Fig. 1B). The test battery consists of three
subtests: open-field, inverted wire mesh, and beam walk.
Each 30-s subtest is scored on a six-point scale (0–5) ac-
cording to graded criteria that capture neurobehavioural
deficits specific to each subtest (Supplementary Fig. 1B). A
composite score of 15 reflects unimpaired performance in
all three subtests. Lower composite scores indicate increas-
ing impairment (mild, 14–10; moderate, 9–5; severe, 4–0).
The test battery was used to assess neurocognitive function
before exposure (pre-injury baseline), after exposure (post-
injury), and following a 3-h rest period (recovery).
Awake, unanaesthetized (anaesthesia-naı
¨ve) adult male
mice, 10 weeks of age, were exposed to single-repeat
impact injury or sham (no injury) control condition. This
experimental protocol was designed to model a common
head injury scenario in contact sports (Crisco et al., 2010).
A total of 320 adult male mice were subjected to experimen-
tal closed-head impact injury (n = 203) or sham (no-injury)
control condition (n = 117). Impact-exposed mice demon-
strated significant post-injury decrements in composite and
subtest scores on the acute neurobehavioural response test
battery (Fig. 2D). Sled velocity (between 3.75m/s and
6.25 m/s) did not significantly correlate with test battery
composite scores (Spearman r = �0.16, P = 0.025, n = 203).
However, the significant decrement in composite scores de-
tected after second impact (Fig. 2D) showed significant posi-
tive correlation with composite scores after first impact
(Spearman r = 0.52, P 5 0.0001, n = 203). Post-traumatic
deficits were noted only in impact-injured mice, spanned
multiple
functional domains,
and
followed
a
transient
course with spontaneous recovery (Fig. 2D). Mean compos-
ite test battery scores showed a highly significant difference
between impact and control groups (linear mixed-effects re-
gression analysis, P 5 0.0001). Comparisons within the
impact group revealed a significant decrement in mean com-
posite score from baseline (pre-injury) to first post-injury
tests
[mean � standard
error
of
the
mean
(SEM):
14.9 � 0.0, 11.6 � 0.2; P 5 0.0001] and further significant
decrement after second impact (mean � SEM: 10.1 � 0.2;
P 5 0.0001). There were no significant differences in com-
posite or subtest scores in the control group at any time
point. Impact-injured mice demonstrated spontaneous recov-
ery with complete resolution of deficits and return to base-
line
(pre-injury)
performance
by
3 h
post-injury
(mean � SEM: 14.8 � 0.0).
Despite tight control of the experimental injury param-
eters, the spectrum of acute neurobehavioural responses
showed wide variation with skewing towards the milder
end of the spectrum (Fig. 2E and F). 81.8% (n = 166/
203) of all impact-injured mice exhibited minimal or no
acute
neurological
impairment
(composite
test
battery
score 510) post-injury (Supplementary Video 1, Mouse
P-238). Nearly two-thirds of these mice (66.5%; n = 135)
showed minimal or no acute neurological impairment after
a second head injury. 15.8% (n = 32/203) of all impact-
injured mice demonstrated transient unilateral acute neuro-
logical
impairment

Figure 2 Experimental closed-head impact injury in awake, unanaesthetized (anaesthesia-naı
¨ve) mice induces abrupt onset,
transient course, and rapid resolution of neurobehavioural impairments that resemble human concussion. (A and B) Schematic of
momentum transfer instrument before (A) and after (B) experimental closed-head impact injury. The developed instrument was designed for use
with unanaesthetized C57BL/6 mice and is compatible with 100% survival without evidence of skull fracture; subdural, epidural, or subarachnoid
haemorrhage; cervical trauma or spinal cord injury; commotio cordis or retinae; or post-traumatic apnoea. Animal subjects are secured across the
thorax and positioned prone such that the head is in physical contact with a helmet analogue composed of an inner foam pad (P) and an outer hard
shell (Sh) fixed to a mobile sled (S). Sled movement is constrained to linear translation by a low-friction monorail track (not shown). Sled motion
is initiated by an operator-triggered computer program that actuates a solenoid valve, releases a bolus of pressurized gas, and accelerates a
stainless-steel slug within the instrument barrel. Vent holes in the barrel convert slug motion to constant velocity. Sequential momentum transfer
from the slug to a captive stainless-steel rod (R; known mass, mr, empirically-determined velocity, vr) and finally to the sled (S; known mass, ms,
empirically-determined velocity, vs). Sled motion results in closure of the distal gap (G1), opening of the proximal gap (G2), and termination by the
backstop (B). A detailed schematic of the developed instrument is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A. (C) Head motion analysis (time-history plot)
during experimental closed-head impact injury reconstructed from high-speed videographic records (100 000 fps; 100 kHz). Head position,

within the first millisecond after impact. Experimental parameters were selected to kinematically match head motion in our blast neurotrauma
mouse model (Supplementary Table 2). Blue dashed line, mean peak X-acceleration (n = 18 mice). Red dashed line, mean peak X-jerk (n = 18

 (Supplementary Video 1, Mouse L-070). The observed
motor deficits in this group were exclusively ipsilateral
with respect to impact (i.e. left-lateral impact induced
right-sided
neurological
deficits).
Only
rarely
(2.5%,
n = 5/203) did we observe mice that demonstrated global
neurological impairment (sustained immobility or frank
seizure; composite test battery score 4 4) after the first
impact (Supplementary Video 1, Mouse P-199). Severe
global
responses
were
rare
(n = 13,
6.4%)
after
the
second impact. Head-injured mice recovered to neuro-
logical baseline, typically within minutes and always by
the end of the 3-h recovery period (Fig. 2E, F and
Supplementary Video 1).
Closed-head impact injury induces early CTE brain
pathologies in unanaesthetized mice
Previous research in our laboratory and others pointed to
the intensity of traumatic head motion, rather than the type
of insult, as the causally determinative mechanism that trig-
gers CTE brain pathologies (Goldstein et al., 2012; Huber
et al., 2013; Kondo et al., 2015). To test this hypothesis,
we set experimental parameters in our impact injury mouse
model such that head motion was kinematically compar-
able to our blast model (Supplementary Table 2). We
hypothesized that impact injury would initiate shearing
forces in the brain, thereby causing microvascular injury,
reactive neuroinflammation, and accumulation of patho-
genic species of phosphorylated tau protein similar to the
cascade triggered by blast exposure (Goldstein et al., 2012;
Huber et al., 2013; Kondo et al., 2015). To investigate this
hypothesis, we examined brains from mice sacrificed 24 h,
3 days, and 2 weeks after single-repeat left-lateral impact
injury (24 h post-injury: impact-injured mice, n = 7; unin-
jured sham control mice, n = 3; 3 days post-injury: impact,
n = 6; sham, n = 2; 2 weeks post-injury: impact, n = 7;
sham,
n = 3;
5.5
months
post-injury,
cis-p-tau
only:
impact, n = 3; sham, n = 1). In contrast to the diffuse
brain pathology noted after blast exposure (Goldstein
et al., 2012), the brain lesions observed after lateral
impact injury localized predominantly to ipsilateral cerebral
cortex subjacent to the impact contact zone (Fig. 3).
Affected brain regions included left perirhinal, insular,
entorhinal, and piriform cortices, as well as adjacent
regions of the left basolateral amygdala. Histopathological
examination of brains 24 h post-injury revealed shrunken
acidophilic
neurons
with
eosinophilic
cytoplasm
and
pyknotic basophilic nuclei at various stages of degeneration
(Fig. 3A). Dystrophic axons (Fig. 3D) containing hyperpho-
sphorylated neurofilaments were observed in proximity to
activated
astrocytes
(Fig.
3G)
and
reactive
microglia
(Fig. 3J). By 3 days post-injury, we observed decreased
neuronal density indicative of neuronal demise, brisk astro-
cytosis and reactive microgliosis in the ipsilateral perirhinal
cortex (Fig. 3B, E, H and K). By 2 weeks post-injury, we
noted regions of markedly decreased neuronal density,
resolving astrocytosis and microgliosis, and clusters of peri-
vascular hemosiderin-laden macrophages (Fig. 3C, F, I and
L). The contralateral perirhinal cortex was histopathologic-
ally normal at all three time points. We did not detect
trauma-related brain pathology in uninjured control mice
(Supplementary Fig. 2A–O). Neuropathological analysis of
post-mortem brains from mice subjected to a single expos-
ure closed-head impact (24 h post-injury: impact, n = 6;
sham, n = 3; 3 days post-injury: impact, n = 6; sham,
n = 3; 2 weeks post-injury: impact, n = 5; sham, n = 3)
under identical experimental conditions revealed a similar
pattern and time course of TBI-related brain pathologies
(Supplementary Fig. 3) as that observed in brains of mice
exposed to two impacts.
Analysis of phosphorylated tauopathy revealed a more
complex pattern. Post-mortem brains at 24 h, 3 days, and
2 weeks post-injury did not reveal evidence of neuronal or
astroglial phosphorylated tauopathy when probed with a
monoclonal antibody directed against a mature tau proteo-
form phosphorylated at serine residue 202 (CP13; pSer202;
Fig. 3M–O). However, we detected robust immunostaining
with the monoclonal antibody cis-p-tau directed against a
highly pathogenic phosphorylated tau proteoform with the
cis-Thr231-Pro motif, an early driver of tau-mediated
neurotoxicity in Alzheimer’s disease and TBI (Nakamura
et al., 2012; Kondo et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016). Cis-p-
tau
immunostaining
(Fig. 3P–W) revealed
pronounced
axonal pathology in ipsilateral perirhinal cortex as early
as 24 h post-injury. Importantly, cis-p-tau was not detected
elsewhere in the brain at this early time point nor in brains
from control mice at any time point (Supplementary Fig.
Figure 2 Continued
exposure to the sham (no injury) control condition (CON) (post-injury test); and (iii) after a 3-h rest period (recovery test). Mice subjected to
experimental impact injury showed significant decrements in composite scores and all three sub-test scores (open-field, inverted wire mesh, beam
walk). IMP, n = 203 mice. CON; n = 117. Values represent means � SEM. ***P 5 0.001. Transient neurobehavioural impairments spanned multiple
functional domains (including arousal, responsivity to environmental stimuli, locomotion, exploration, motor performance, habituation) that

 2P–W). By 3 days and 2 weeks post-injury, cis-p-tau immu-
noreactivity was present not only in axons but also as dot-
like puncta that were miscompartmentalized in the soma
and dendrites of neurons in the ipsilateral (left) perirhinal
cortex, and to a lesser degree, contralateral (right) peri-
rhinal cortex. Surprisingly, cis-p-tau immunoreactivity was
robustly present in perirhinal and primary motor cortices of
both hemispheres 5.5 months post-injury (Fig. 3S and W).
The presence of bilateral cis-p-tau immunoreactivity at this
remote post-injury time point, and in brain regions distant
from the primary locus of brain injury, suggests either ex-
treme persistence of incipient tauopathy, or alternatively,
progressive tauopathy involving spread beyond the origi-
nating injury (see ‘Discussion’ section). Neuropathological
analysis of post-mortem brains from mice subjected to a
single closed-head impact (Supplementary Fig. 3Y–HH) re-
vealed a similar pattern and time course of tau protein
pathologies as that observed in brains of mice exposed to
two impacts.
Perivascular accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein
in the depths of cortical sulci represents the defining patho-
logical hallmark of CTE (McKee et al., 2016) and points to
traumatic microvascular injury (Kenney et al., 2016) as a
likely contributor to CTE pathogenesis. To test the hypoth-
esis that experimental impact injury induces traumatic
microvascular injury, we conducted electron microscopic
analysis
of
brains
from
mice
2
weeks
post-injury.
Ultrastructural examination of these brains revealed evi-
dence of persistent, focal microvascular injury notable for
dysmorphic capillaries; abnormal endothelial cells with

macrophages (darts), representing microhaemorrhage residua, were scattered throughout the affected region. Scale bar = 50 mm. Contralateral
(right) perirhinal cortex was histopathologically normal by GFAP immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 2G–I). (J–L) Immunostaining for the
myeloid cell marker Iba1 (arrowheads) in ipsilateral (left) perirhinal cortex revealed minimal microgliosis at 24 h (J), brisk microgliosis at 3 days
(K), resolved microgliosis at 2 weeks (L) post-injury. Scale bars = 50 mm. (K) Peak microgliosis at 3 days post-injury revealed clusters of intensely
Iba1-immunoreactive, ramified myeloid cells (arrowheads) and less abundant amoeboid and rodlike Iba1-immunoreactive microglia (open and half-
filled arrowheads, respectively). Iba1-immunoreactive perivascular myeloid cells were associated with the parenchymal (abluminal) surface of a
small blood vessel (between dashed lines). Scale bar = 50 mm. (L) Microgliosis was largely resolved by 2 weeks post-injury. Haemosiderin-laden
macrophage (darts) were observed throughout the affected region. Scale bar = 50 mm. Contralateral (right) perirhinal cortex was histopatho-
logically normal by Iba1 immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 2J–L). (M–O) Phosphorylated tau protein immunostaining with monoclonal antibody
CP13 (pS202) was negative throughout the brain at 24 h (M), 3 days (N), and 2 weeks (O) post-injury. Haemosiderin-laden macrophage (darts)
were observed throughout the affected region by 2 weeks post-injury (O). Scale bars = 50 mm. The contralateral (right) perirhinal cortex did not
demonstrate CP13 immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 2M–O). (P–W) Immunohistofluorescence staining for cis-p-tau (cis-motif, pThr231-Pro),
a highly pathogenic early phosphorylated tau proteoform, was present at 24 h (P), 3 days (Q), 2 weeks (R), and 5.5 months (S) post-injury in
ipsilateral (left) perirhinal cortex. Faint cis-p-tau immunoreactivity was observed in axons (arrowheads) in the ipsilateral (left, P) but not
contralateral (right, T) perirhinal cortex 24 h post-injury. By 3 days post-injury, cis-p-tau immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral perirhinal cortex (Q)
was intense, not only in axons (arrowheads), but also as dot-like inclusions in neuronal soma and dendrites (arrow). Cis-p-tau immunoreactivity in
the contralateral perirhinal cortex (U) was present but faint at this time point. By 2 weeks post-injury, cis-p-tau immunoreactivity was observed in
axons (arrowheads) and as dot-like inclusions in neuronal soma and dendrites (arrow) in both hemispheres. Cis-p-tau immunoreactivity was more
pronounced in the ipsilateral (left, R) than contralateral (right, V) perirhinal cortex. Surprisingly, we detected cis-p-tau immunoreactivity 5.5
months post-injury (the longest time point measured) in axons (arrowheads) and as dot-like inclusions in neuronal soma and dendrites (arrow) in
perirhinal cortex of both hemispheres (left, S; right, W). Scale bars = 20 mm. Sham (no-injury) control mice did not show evidence of cis-p-tau
immunoreactivity in either hemisphere at any of the analysed time points (Supplementary Fig. 2P–W). (X–AA) Ultrastructural evidence of
persistent traumatic microvascular injury revealed by electron microscopy 2 weeks post-injury. (X) Low-power electron micrograph of CA1
region of the left hippocampus shows abnormal capillary (c) and nearby neuron (n). A capillary endothelial cell (e) and adjacent pericyte (p) are
encircled by hydropic astrocytic end-feet (ae). Perivascular astrocyte processes exhibit pale oedematous cytoplasm with few mitochondria (m),
subcellular organelles, or cytoskeletal elements. The capillary basal lamina is thickened, highly branched, and tortuous. Electron-dense inclusion
bodies (open arrowheads) and lipofuscin granules with lipid droplets (partially-filled arrowhead) are evident. These ultrastructural pathologies are
inconsistent with processing artefact. Magnification �1500. Scale bar = 2 mm. (Y) Low-power electron micrograph of left medial prefrontal
cortex 2 weeks after injury shows an abnormal capillary (c) and two nearby neurons, one with normal ultrastructure (n1) and the other
undergoing cellular involution (n2). Endothelial cell (e), perivascular pericyte (p), and hydropic astrocytic end-feet (ae) are present. Magnification
�1200. Scale bar = 2 mm. (Z) Electron micrograph of the CA1 region of the left hippocampus shows a hydropic astrocytic end-foot (ae) and
pericyte (p) of an involuting capillary. The basal laminae are thickened and tortuous (arrowheads). Electron-dense inclusion body (i), swollen

(Fig.

Perivascular astrocytes and pericytes in the perirhinal
cortex, hippocampus, and frontal cortex were also notable
for electron-dense inclusion bodies, lipofuscin granules,
myelin figures, and autophagosomic vesicles. Pericytes,
microglial cells, dystrophic nerve fibres, and dark neurons
were observed in proximity to small blood vessels in brains
from impact-injured mice but not uninjured controls. These
findings provide direct evidence that experimental closed-
head impact injury damages small blood vessels and in-
duces
persistent
focal
traumatic
microvascular
injury
(Goldstein et al., 2012; Huber et al., 2013; Hay et al.,
2015; Doherty et al., 2016; Kenney et al., 2016).
Closed-head impact injury triggers differential
expression of phosphorylated tau proteoforms
Given the effects of closed-head impact on the microvascu-
lature and induction of cis-p-tauopathy, we were surprised
by the absence of mature tau protein neuropathology in
impact-injured mice (Fig. 3M–O). We hypothesized that
epitopes detected by cis-p-tau (cis-pThr231) and CP13
(pSer202) antibodies represent earlier and later stage tauo-
pathy, respectively. To investigate the possible presence of
CP13-immunoreactive molecular pathology, we performed
quantitative tau protein immunoblot analysis of brains
from impact-injured mice (n = 16) compared to sham (un-
injured) control mice (n = 14) (Fig. 4). We detected a sig-
nificant increase in both the intensity and mobility range
of CP13-immunoreactive phosphorylated tau protein in
brains from impact-injured mice compared to controls
(Bonferroni-corrected
two-tailed
Student’s
t-test,
P = 0.006). This effect was accompanied by a significant
increase in total tau protein (Tau5) (P = 0.001), indicating
accumulation of both phosphorylated and non-phosphory-
lated tau protein species. Increased brain levels of tau pro-
tein were detected bilaterally. Also notable was the increase
in higher apparent molecular weight tau protein species in
the contralateral compared to ipsilateral hemispheres of
impact-injured mice. This finding may indicate differences
in tau protein phosphorylation or proteoform composition
at sites of traumatic injury compared to brain regions af-
fected by latent tau propagation or spread.
Relationship of traumatic microvascular injury to
early CTE tau pathology
Neuropathological examination of teenage athlete brains in
the acute-subacute period after closed-head impact injuries
(Fig. 1) and histopathological and ultrastructural analyses
of brains from impact-injured mice (Fig. 3) suggested trau-
matic microvascular injury and blood–brain barrier disrup-
tion as candidate mechanisms linking closed-head impact to
acute brain injury and chronic post-traumatic sequelae
(Martland, 1928; Hay et al., 2015; Doherty et al., 2016;
Kenney et al., 2016), including CTE (Goldstein et al., 2012;
McKee et al., 2013, 2016). To investigate this hypothesis,
we injected mice with Evans blue, an albumin-binding sul-
phonated diazo dye (960 Da) that is normally excluded
from the brain by an intact blood–brain barrier (Rawson,
1943; Povlishock, 1998). Examination of post-mortem
brains from Evans blue-injected mice sacrificed 24 h after
left-lateral impact injury (n = 12) or the uninjured sham
control condition (n = 7) revealed a spectrum of macro-
scopic
pathologies
(Fig.
5A).
Brains
from
�50%
of
impact-injured mice were grossly normal and showed no
evidence of Evans blue extravasation, contusion, necrosis,
haematoma, haemorrhage, or other gross brain pathologies
(Grade 0; Fig. 5A). Brains from �40% of impact-injured
mice demonstrated faint Evans blue extravasation without
evidence of frank haemorrhage, haematoma, or contusion
(Grade I; Fig. 5A). These focal lesions localized exclusively
to the lateral surface of the ipsilateral perirhinal cortex
subjacent to the impact contact zone. Together, these two
classes of normal or minor brain pathology (Grades 0 and
I, respectively) constituted �90% of the experimentally
head-injured mice. By contrast, brains from �10% of
impact-injured mice exhibited focal contusions with petech-
ial haemorrhages surrounded by a penumbra of extrava-
sated Evans blue dye (Grade II; Fig. 5A). These complex
lesions localized exclusively to surface cortex ipsilateral to
impact. Evidence of gross neuropathology (Grades I, II) in
�50% of impact-injured mice contrasts with the absence of
gross pathology in all mice exposed to experimental blast
under conditions of comparable head kinematics (Goldstein
et al., 2012).
We confirmed blood–brain barrier disruption by quanti-
tative Evans blue fluorescence brain imaging (Fig. 5B–D).
Evans blue-specific fluorescence signal intensity was deter-
mined after spectral unmixing to remove background
autofluorescence. Cluster analysis using a Gaussian mixture
model (Fig. 5D) identified three distinct injury classes based
on fluorescence signal intensity: Grade 0, intact blood–
brain
barrier
(411.4 � 83.3
counts/pixel,
2.9 � 1.7%
suprathreshold pixels); Grade I, minor blood–brain barrier
disruption
(707.5 � 191.2
counts/pixel,
18.8 � 6.2%
suprathreshold pixels); Grade II, severe blood–brain barrier
disruption
(1203.6 � 210.5
counts/pixel,
58.4 � 8.2%
suprathreshold pixels). In the control group (n = 7), six
mice (86%) were classified as Grade 0, one mouse (14%)
as Grade I, and none (0%) as Grade II. In the impact group
(n = 12), five mice were classified as Grade 0 (42%), five
mice (42%) as Grade I, and two mice (17%) as Grade II.
The three injury classes mirrored the groups identified by
gross pathology (Fig. 5A). Inclusion of all groups revealed a
statistically significant effect of impact on ipsilateral blood–
brain barrier disruption when compared to control (linear
mixed-effects regression analysis, P = 0.0004; Fig. 5C).
Consistent with the post-injury neuropathology (Fig. 3),
blood–brain barrier disruption was not detected in the
contralateral hemisphere of brains from impact-injured
mice.

closed-head
impact injury. Since impact injury was associated with ip-
silateral blood–brain barrier disruption, we investigated the
possibility that mild TBI may promote non-haemorrhagic
accumulation of extravasated serum albumin in the brain.
Mice subjected to unilateral impact demonstrated robust
evidence of ipsilateral serum albumin extravasation and
co-localizing reactive astrocytosis (Fig. 5H–P; cf. 5E–G).
Focal albumin deposition and co-localizing reactive astro-
cytosis were detected exclusively in ipsilateral (left) peri-
rhinal cortex in impact-injured mice (Fig. 5H–J) but not
in any brain region in control mice (Fig. 5E–G and
Supplementary
Fig.
2).
Peak
signals
for
extravasated
serum albumin and astrocytosis co-localized at 3 days
post-injury in impact-injured mice. Extravasated albumin
also co-localized with TGF-b1-associated astrocytosis and
downstream markers of transforming growth factor beta
signalling, in ipsilateral (Fig. 5K–P; Supplementary Fig.
4A and D) but not in contralateral perirhinal cortex of
impact-injured mice (Supplementary Fig. 4B and E) or in
any brain region of uninjured control mice (Supplementary
Fig. 4C and F).
In vivo detection of traumatic microvascular injury by
dynamic brain imaging
We reasoned that the blood–brain barrier disruption we
detected ex vivo (Fig. 5A–P) would be detectable in vivo
using a modified dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI strategy
(Weissberg et al., 2014) combined with systemically admin-
istered gadofosveset trisodium, a gadolinium-based contrast
agent that binds albumin (Lauffer et al., 1998). We per-
formed a proof-of-concept feasibility study to validate this
strategy for in vivo diagnostic evaluation of traumatic
microvascular injury. In vivo dynamic neuroimaging com-
bined with systemic administration of gadofosveset triso-
dium confirmed acute and persistent blood–brain barrier
disruption in left but not right perirhinal cortex (ipsilateral
and contralateral to impact, respectively) in impact-injured
mice but not control mice (Fig. 5S–T). The ipsilateral
blood–brain barrier permeability defect in impact-injured
mice co-localized with T1-weighted hyperintensities in the
affected cortical field (Fig. 5Q–R). Blood–brain barrier

Figure 5 Unilateral, closed-head impact injury induces focal blood–brain barrier disruption, serum albumin extravasation,
astrocytosis, myeloid inflammatory cell infiltration, and TREM2 + microglial activation in cerebral cortex ipsilateral and sub-
jacent to impact. (A) Gross pathology in representative brains from a control mouse (CON) exposed to sham (no injury) control condition
compared to brains from mice subjected to experimental closed-head impact injury (IMP) with varying degrees of gross brain pathology (Grade 0,
I, II, respectively) 24 h post-injury. Grade 0: absence of gross brain pathology with no evidence of macroscopic tissue damage (contusion, necrosis,
hematoma, haemorrhage, or extravasated Evans blue) was observed in 100% of brains from CON mice and �50% of brains from IMP mice. Grade
I: minimal brain pathology marked only by focal Evans blue extravasation (indicative of disruption of the blood–brain barrier, BBB) was observed in
�40% of IMP mice but none (0%) of the CON mice. Grade II: relatively rare brains marked by complex lesions that included Evans blue
extravasation and contusion observed in �10% of IMP mice but none (0%) in CON mice. (B) Evans blue-specific fluorescence imaging of
representative mouse brain sections showing blood–brain barrier disruption 24 h post-injury. Arrows, left-lateral fluorescence signal indicating
area of blood–brain barrier disruption (in Evans blue-specific fluorescence intensity counts) in cerebral cortex ipsilateral and subjacent to
experimental impact injury (IMP) but not sham (no-injury) control condition (CON). Serial brain sections (anterior to caudal, S1–S4, respectively)
and gross pathology injury grade (0, I, II) as indicated. (C) Quantitative analysis of blood–brain barrier disruption by coronal section Evans blue-
specific fluorescence brain imaging 24 h after IMP or CON exposure. Blood–brain barrier disruption localized to the perirhinal, insular, entorhinal,
and piriform cortices and basolateral amygdala of the left hemisphere ipsilateral and subjacent to the impact contact zone. Inset: rostral-to-caudal
brain sections, S1–S4. ***P 5 0.001; NS = not statistically different. (D) Gaussian mixed model analysis of Evans blue fluorescence brain imaging
yielded three groups that corresponded to gross pathology classification (Grades 0, I, II). (E–J) Anatomical localization of extravasated serum
albumin (SALB; E, G, H and J) and co-localizing reactive astrocytosis (GFAP; F, G, I and J) in left perirhinal cortex ipsilateral to impact 3 days post-

 permeability defects were not detected by neuroimaging in
the contralateral cortex of impact-injured mice or either
hemisphere in uninjured control mice. Post-mortem neuro-
pathological examination did not reveal evidence of haem-
orrhagic contusion, suggesting that the permeability defect
resulted from blood–brain barrier dysfunction rather than
intraparenchymal haemorrhage.
To confirm that the detected neuroimaging abnormalities
represented true blood–brain barrier permeability disrup-
tion, we used laser ablation-assisted metallomic imaging
mass spectrometry to map tissue concentrations and spatial
distribution of gadolinium in coronal sections of brains
harvested from impact-injured and control mice. Mice in
both groups received intravenous gadofosveset trisodium
during dynamic neuroimaging (Fig. 5Q–V). Metallomic
imaging mass spectrometry maps of brains obtained from
impact-injured mice revealed enhanced gadolinium accumu-
lation in left perirhinal cortex (Fig. 5V) that co-localized
with
the
neuroimaging
abnormalities
(Fig.
5Q–T).
Enhanced gadolinium accumulation was not detected in
contralateral perirhinal cortex of impact-injured mice or
control mice. These results confirm that impact injury
was associated with ipsilateral traumatic microvascular
injury and focal blood–brain barrier disruption in mice
exposed to unilateral closed-head impact injury. Our results
provide ‘proof of concept’ validation of dynamic brain ima-
ging with gadofosveset trisodium for diagnostic evaluation
of blood–brain barrier dysfunction in the acute-subacute
period after closed-head impact injury.
Relationship of neuroinflammation to traumatic
microvascular injury and early CTE tau pathology
Given the co-localization of three CTE-associated brain
pathologies—phosphorylated tauopathy, traumatic micro-
vascular injury, and blood–brain barrier disruption—after
impact neurotrauma and the known involvement of mye-
loid-derived cells in tau processing (Asai et al., 2015) and
association with CTE (Cherry et al., 2016), we hypothe-
sized that focal neuroinflammatory responses would be
triggered by impact injury. To test this hypothesis, we
used flow cytometry to characterize inflammatory cell
phenotypes
and
time
course
of
neuroinflammatory
responses triggered by experimental closed-head impact
injury
(Fig.
5W–BB;
Supplementary
Fig.
4G–I).
We observed a significant increase in the number of infil-
trating peripheral myeloid cells 3 days post-injury in brains
from impact-injured mice (n = 7) compared to controls

with peak astrocytosis and microgliosis detected by histo-
pathology (Fig. 3H and K). Immunophenotyping analysis
revealed co-expression of molecular markers that identify
these cells as presumptive inflammatory monocytes and
brain macrophage derived from inflammatory monocytes
(Fig. 5Y) (Murray and Wynn, 2011). Sub-phenotyping
based on monocyte surface antigen expression in impact-
injured mouse brains at Day 3 post-injury revealed a sig-
nificant increase in all three functional classes (Fig. 5Z):

(Q and R) co-localized with blood–brain barrier permeability defect detected by DCE-MRI (S and T) in the left perirhinal cortex (arrows) 3 h and
3 days after IMP but not CON exposure. Non-specific signal was observed in the ventricles and sagittal sinus. D = dorsal, V = ventral; L = left,

CON (U) exposure. Gadolinium accumulation detected by Gd-MIMS co-localized with T1-weighted hyperintensity and blood–brain barrier
permeability defect detected by DCE-MRI, thus confirming intracerebral blood–brain barrier disruption. (W–BB) Flow cytometry analysis
showed that IMP triggers increased number of CD45 + inflammatory cells and activation of TREM2 + microglia in the brain post-injury. CD45 +

ipsilateral and subjacent to experimental impact injury in Ccr2RFP/Cx3cr1GFP mice at 3 days post-injury (IMP: CC, DD, GG and HH) or control
(CON: EE and FF). Representative fluorescence microscopy images show red-labelled Ccr2RFP-expressing inflammatory cells (arrows, CC)
throughout the ipsilateral (left) perirhinal and adjacent cortex, basolateral amygdala, and overlying dura and leptomeninges (CC and HH) 3 days
post-injury. The affected cortex was also notable for large numbers of ameboid Cx3cr1GFP-expressing microglia (arrowheads; CC and GG) that
were also present, but to a lesser degree, in the contralateral (right) hemisphere (DD). Note clustering of Ccr2RFP-expressing inflammatory cells

expressing microglia were absent in brains from Ccr2RFP/Cx3cr1GFP mice 3 days after CON exposure (EE and FF). Bars (CC–FF), 40 microns;

(Fig. 5X).
We hypothesized that neuroinflammatory reactions to
closed-head
impact
injury
would
be
accompanied
by
trauma-stimulated
microglial
phenotype
transformation.
To evaluate this hypothesis, we investigated microglial ex-
pression of TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on mye-
loid cells 2 protein), an immunoglobulin superfamily cell
surface receptor and homeostatic regulator of cytokine pro-
duction, phagocytic clearance, innate immunity responses,
and tissue repair (Bhaskar et al., 2010; Kokiko-Cochran
et al., 2016; Ulrich and Holtzman, 2016). TREM2 expres-
sion is upregulated in activated microglia (Schmid et al.,
2002;
Kawabori
et
al.,
2015;
Wang
et
al.,
2015).
Moreover, TREM2 gene variants in human populations
are associated with increased risk of age-related neurode-
generative
diseases,
including
Alzheimer’s
disease
(Guerreiro et al., 2013; Jonsson et al., 2013; Phimister
and Tanzi, 2015; Ulrich and Holtzman, 2016). Flow cyto-
metry immunophenotyping revealed a significant increase
in the percentage of microglia expressing TREM2 [one-
way ANOVA, F(5,38) = 13.14, P 5 0.0001; Bonferroni-
corrected two-tailed Student’s t-tests: 24 h, P = 0.0072,
Impact n = 8, Control n = 8; 2 weeks, P = 0.0348, Impact
n = 7, Control n = 6] compared to controls (Fig. 5AA).
Notably, activation of microglial TREM2 expression tem-
porally preceded peripheral monocyte infiltration in brains
of impact-injured mice. By contrast, we did not detect a
significant change in TREM2-expressing infiltrating mye-
loid cells in brains from impact-injured mice compared to
controls at any of the three time points (Fig. 5BB).
To confirm cellular phenotype localization and trans-
formation of brain-resident microglia and presumptive
brain-infiltrating
monocytes,
we
crossed
genetically-
modified mice that produce red fluorescent protein-labelled
inflammatory monocytes (Ccr2RFP mice) with genetically-
modified mice that produce green fluorescent protein-
labelled
brain-resident
microglia
and
perivascular
macrophages (Cx3cr1GFP mice). F1 progeny expressed red
fluorescent protein-labelled monocytes (red cells) and green
fluorescent protein-labelled brain-resident microglia and
perivascular
macrophages
(green
cells).
We
subjected
crossed mice to impact injury under the same experimental
conditions used in the preceding experiments. Fluorescence
microscopic analysis of brain sections obtained from these
mice at Day 3 post-injury revealed large numbers of red-
labelled monocytes throughout the ipsilateral perirhinal, in-
sular, and piriform cortices and overlying leptomeninges
subjacent to impact (Fig. 5CC and HH). Presumptive infil-
trating monocytes co-localized with large ameboid-shaped
microglia and perivascular macrophages (Nayak et al.,
2014) (Fig. 5CC and GG). Presumptive red-labelled infil-
trating
monocytes
and
green-labelled
ameboid-shaped
microglia and macrophages were also present but far
more scarce in the contralateral (right) hemisphere at Day
3 post-injury (Fig. 5DD). By contrast, presumptive infiltrat-
ing monocytes were minimally present and co-localizing
ameboid-shaped microglia and macrophages were absent
in brains from uninjured control mice (Fig. 5EE–FF).
Unilateral impact injury induces bilateral
electrophysiological deficits in hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex
Given the known clinical association of mild TBI with cog-
nitive impairment and executive dysfunction (Evans, 2006;
Ropper and Gorson, 2007; Alosco et al., 2017), and recent
recognition of concordant abnormalities in early-stage CTE
(i.e.
traumatic
encephalopathy
syndrome;
Montenigro
et al., 2014, 2017), we hypothesized that experimental
head injury could disrupt neurophysiological function in
two
critical
brain
regions
subserving
these
functions,
namely, the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex
(McDonald et al., 2002; Sigurdsson and Duvarci, 2015;
Place et al., 2016). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated
axonal conduction velocity of hippocampal pyramidal cell
compound action potentials in the stratum alveus (Fig. 6A–
D and Supplementary Fig. 5A) and activity-dependent LTP
of synaptic transmission at excitatory inputs to pyramidal
neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (Fig. 6E–J and
Supplementary Fig. 5B–D). Analysis of hippocampal pyr-
amidal cell compound action potentials (Fig. 6A) revealed
significant and persistent decrements in axonal conduction
velocity in the ipsilateral (left) hippocampus at 24 h, 3 days,
and 2 weeks post-injury (Fig. 6B–D). Three-way ANOVA
[main factors: injury (levels: TBI and control), post-injury
interval (levels: 24 h, 3 days, and 2 weeks), and side (levels:
ipsilateral and contralateral to impact)] revealed a signifi-
cant effect for injury [F(1,119) = 71.431; P 5 0.0001] on
axonal conductance, with comparable decrements in hippo-
campus ipsilateral and contralateral to impact 24 h, 3 days,
and 2 weeks post-injury (Fig. 6B and C). There was no
significant
effect
for
either
post-TBI
interval
[F(2,119) = 0.212;
P = 0.8094]
or
brain
hemisphere
[F(1,119) = 0.033; P = 0.8554]. While axonal conduction
velocity in the right (contralateral) hippocampus returned
to baseline levels by 2 weeks post-injury, axonal conduc-
tion velocity in the left (ipsilateral) hippocampus remained
impaired at this time point (Fig. 6D).
Given the impact-induced functional impairments in hip-
pocampal axonal conduction velocity, we examined the
effect of impact injury on synaptic transmission and stimu-
lus-evoked LTP of synaptic strength at excitatory inputs to
pyramidal
neurons
in
the
medial
prefrontal
cortex
(Supplementary Fig. 5B and C). The rationale for this in-
vestigation is based on neuroanatomical and functional

 connections between the hippocampus and medial pre-
frontal cortex, and additionally, the prominence of execu-
tive
dysfunction
(mediated,
in
part,
by
the
medial
prefrontal cortex) that commonly accompanies closed-
head impact injuries in humans (see ‘Discussion’ section).
Analysis of white matter-evoked postsynaptic field potential
input-output relations indicated that impact injury did not
alter baseline synaptic transmission (Supplementary Fig.
5D). However, left-lateral impact induced significant and
persistent bilateral decrements in stimulus-evoked LTP in
the medial prefrontal cortex at 24 h, 3 days, and 2 weeks
post-injury (Figs. 6E–J). Three-way ANOVA (main factors
and levels as above) determined that only injury had a
significant effect on LTP in the medial prefrontal cortex
[F(1,60) = 60.227; P 5 0.0001], with no effect of either
post-TBI interval [F(2,60) = 0.029; P = 0.9761] or recording
side [F(1,60) = 0.949; P = 0.3340], and no interaction of
main factors. Moreover, the magnitude of post-tetanic po-
tentiation
immediately
after
application
of
theta-burst
stimulation was also reduced at all three time points.
Together, these results indicate that exposure to unilateral
closed-head impact injury induces acute, persistent, and
bilateral impairments in hippocampal axonal conduction
velocity and disruption of short- and long-term activity-
dependent synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal
cortex.
Acute neurobehavioural responses to closed-head
impact injury do not correlate with TBI and CTE
endpoints
Recent clinical findings suggest that cumulative concussion
exposure
correlates
poorly
with
post-traumatic
brain
pathologies and functional sequelae (Breedlove et al.,
2012; Davenport et al., 2014; Talavage et al., 2014;
Abbas et al., 2015; Montenigro et al., 2017). Moreover,
post-mortem studies have confirmed that a subset (�20%)
of former athletes with neuropathologically-verified CTE
did not have a history of concussion (Bieniek et al.,
2015;
Stein
et
al., 2015a). Our
experimental
results
allowed us to evaluate the putative relationship between
concussion and CTE brain pathology by testing for pos-
sible correlations between composite scores on the acute
neurobehavioural response test battery and quantitative
endpoints
associated
with
TBI
and
early
CTE
(Supplementary Table 3). Target metrics included blood–
brain barrier disruption by Evans blue-specific fluores-

et al., 2015; Montenigro et al., 2017) and pathological
findings in humans (Bieniek et al., 2015; Stein et al.,
2015a), we did not detect any statistically significant cor-
relation between test battery composite scores and quanti-
tative endpoints associated with TBI and early CTE
(Supplementary Table 3).
Based on these results, we hypothesized that the mechan-
isms underpinning concussion-like deficits after experimen-
tal impact injury may be independent of the mechanisms
that drive TBI and CTE brain pathologies. We investigated
the mechanistic underpinnings of this hypothesis in the fol-
lowing section.
Head impact and blast exposure
induce different force loading, shear
stress, and concussion-like deficits
The brain pathologies and functional sequelae observed
after experimental impact injury are generally consistent
with corresponding responses following blast exposure
(Goldstein et al., 2012; Huber et al., 2013; Kondo et al.,
2015). While the manner in which kinetic energy is trans-
ferred to the head is different in the two types of insult, the
brain pathologies associated with each are similar in la-
boratory
animals
and
humans
(Omalu
et
al.,
2011;
Goldstein et al., 2012; Huber et al., 2013; McKee et al.,
2013; Kondo et al., 2015; Shively et al., 2016; Mez et al.,
2017). Concordance of head motion in our impact and
blast mouse models enabled comparative evaluation of
acute neurobehavioural responses, structural brain pathol-
ogies, and functional sequelae produced by these two bio-
mechanically

We subjected awake, anaesthesia-naı
¨ve C57BL/6 male
mice to experimental closed-head impact injury (n = 203)
or blast exposure (n = 24) under conditions that produce
comparable head kinematics and evaluated mice after ex-
posure using the acute neurobehavioural responses test bat-
tery (Fig. 7A). Baseline (pre-injury) testing showed that
mice in both groups exhibited indistinguishable mean com-
posite test battery scores (mean � SEM: impact, 14.9 � 0.0;
blast, 14.8 � 0.1; linear mixed-effects regression analysis,
P 4 0.05). While impact-injured mice demonstrated the ex-
pected significant decrement in post-injury composite scores
(mean � SEM: 11.6 � 0.2; linear mixed-effects regression
analysis,

1),
blast-
exposed mice did not (mean � SEM: 14.5 � 0.1; linear
mixed-effects regression analysis, P 4 0.05; Supplementary
Video 1). This result was robust, reliable, and entirely un-
expected, especially given comparable head kinematics in
the two models. It is worth noting that the absence of
acute neurobehavioural deficits following blast exposure
comports with the low incidence of concussion after pure
blast exposure in the absence of concomitant contact injury
(Barrow and Rhoads, 1944; Luethcke et al., 2011). After 3-
h recovery, both experimental groups again demonstrated

(mean � SEM:

14.5 � 0.1;

that head motion in the two experimental models was kine-
matically comparable, our observation of decrements in test
battery composite scores after impact injury but not after
blast exposure argues against head motion per se as a pri-
mary causative mechanism that differentiates concussion-
like neurobehavioural responses after these insults.
To investigate the origins of this unexpected difference,
we constructed mouse headforms to which we attached
pressure-sensitive film on the lateral surface. Impact and
blast exposures were conducted as above. Force loading
was assessed by determining total pixel intensity registered
by the pressure-sensitive film (Fig. 7B). Total pixel intensity
on film exposed to impact was significantly greater than for
blast (mean � SEM, n = 5: impact, 6.49 � 0.43 � 106 a.u.;
blast,
0.28 � 0.04 � 106 a.u.;
Bonferroni-corrected
one-
tailed Student’s t-test, P = 0.0002) while both impact and
blast generated significantly greater pixel intensities than
respective controls (mean � SEM, n = 5: impact control,
1.58 � 0.66 � 104 a.u.;
blast
control,
2.67 � 0.51 �
104 a.u.; Bonferroni-corrected one-tailed Student’s t-tests:
impact versus impact control, P = 0.0002; blast versus
blast control, P = 0.0089). Moreover, impact produced
high pressure loading that was restricted to the contact
zone, whereas blast generated far lower pressure that was
evenly distributed within the measurement area (Fig. 7B).
These results point to fundamentally different energy load-
ing regimes at the moment of traumatic contact.
Experimental methods are not currently available to
measure stresses in discrete regions of the living mouse
brain at microsecond time resolution. Thus, we investigated
how these results relate to the observed differences in acute
neurobehavioural responses to impact injury and blast ex-
posure by using dynamic computational simulations of our
two experimental mouse models. We used the Arbitrary-
Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrostructural finite element code
ALE3D (Noble et al., 2017) developed at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory to simulate the experimen-
tal impact instrument described above and blast tube used
here and in previous studies (Goldstein et al., 2012; Kondo
et al., 2015). We simplified the computational analysis by
assuming a spherical mouse head consisting of a 0.2 mm
thick skull, 0.2 mm subdural layer (with CSF), and a
10 mm diameter brain (Fig. 7C). Initial conditions were
set such that the resulting centre-of-geometry motions
were similar to each other and representative of empiric-
ally-derived experimental data in both animal models. Since
the spherical mouse head model excluded mass external to
the skull, it was necessary to proportionally scale the
impact rod velocity to produce head motion that matched
peak head acceleration calculated for blast. Skull deflection
during impact was 19.8 mm (50.2% of the skull diameter)
consistent with an absence of skull fracture or significant
skull deformation in our closed-head impact injury mouse
model. The close agreement of the simulation results with
empirically-derived head kinematic data obtained in living
mice provided validation for the computational methods
used in the computational comparisons below. Peak accel-
erations and calculated head injury criterion (HIC) pro-
vided further confirmation of the kinematic similarity of
the impact and blast simulations (Fig. 7C and D).
While head accelerations were closely approximated in
the two simulations (Fig. 7D), calculated overpressures in
the
brain
were
larger

 for the observed differences in acute neurobehavioural re-
sponses to impact injury compared to blast exposure, then
we would expect blast-exposed mice to preferentially ex-
hibit greater impairment than impact-injured mice. Our ex-
perimental results indicated the opposite effect (Fig. 7A).
This result indicates that intracranial pressure is not likely
to be a primary physical driver of differential concussion-
like responses that occur after impact injury but not after
blast exposure. As an alternative hypothesis, we postulated
that
intraparenchymal
shear
stress
could
differentiate
impact and blast with respect to the observed differences
in acute neurobehavioural responses. Selected computa-
tional solutions at peak head acceleration are shown as
spatially-mapped numerical values of the von Mises stress
(a measure of shear stress) in the skull, CSF, and brain
along with coincident overpressure in the padding for
impact and overpressure in the air surrounding the head
for blast (Fig. 7E and F). The magnitude and temporal
evolution of shear stress in the head (skull, CSF, brain) is
shown at time of contact, at peak head acceleration, and
150 ms after peak head acceleration in both simulations
(Fig. 7G and H) and as time histories at each of the
three selected intracerebral Lagrangian tracer locations
(Fig. 7I and J). The temporal history of stress dynamics
in the impact and blast simulation models are shown in
Supplementary Video 2.
The impact simulation model revealed a large area of
relatively sustained high peak shear stress that localized
within a discrete brain region ipsilateral and subjacent to
the impact contact zone (Fig. 7E). By contrast, the blast
simulation demonstrated modest and relatively brief peak
shear stress that was limited to a small area in the contra-
lateral region of the brain on the leeward side of head
(Fig. 7F). The relatively minor shear stress resulting from
blast coalesced �25 ms after the blast reached the skull and
dissipated
�85 ms
later
(total
duration,
�60 ms).
Representative time histories of the von Mises stress at se-
lected tracer points in the model head showed that impact
produced 7-fold greater peak shear stress compared to blast
(Figs.
7I–J).
Moreover,
impact-induced
shear
stress
exhibited strong spatial dependence with peak magnitude
in the ipsilateral brain subjacent to the impact contact zone.
Importantly, peak shear stress triggered by impact occurred
�0.25 ms after contact (centre of mass motion 4 300 mm)
and before onset of gross head motion. These simulations
(Fig. 7E–J) show that spatially and temporally localized
shear stress in impact and absence in blast result from dif-
ferences in focal loading and the low shear modulus of the
brain.
These computational results are consistent with our ob-
servation of acute onset of transient neurobehavioural def-
icits across multiple functional domains in mice subjected
to experimental impact injury but not after blast exposure
under conditions matched for head kinematics (Fig. 7A).
The impact simulation results are also consistent with ex-
perimental observations of abrupt onset of right-sided
motor weakness and incoordination after left-sided impact
injury. These results are also concordant with neuropatho-
logical evidence demonstrating that unilateral closed-head
impact injury in our mouse model produces acute-subacute
brain pathology that localizes predominantly in cerebral
cortex and neighbouring brain regions (e.g. basolateral
amygdala) ipsilateral and subjacent to the head impact con-
tact zone.
Discussion
We examined post-mortem brains obtained from teenage con-
tact sport athletes who died in the acute-subacute period
(1 day–4 months) after closed-head impact injuries and com-
pared results to control brains from an age-matched control
cohort of contact sport athletes without recent head injuries.
Neuropathological analysis revealed a spectrum of post-trau-
matic pathologies, including astrocytosis, axonopathy, micro-
vasculopathy,
neuroinflammation,
and
phosphorylated
tauopathy.
The
presence
of
haemosiderin-laden
macro-
phage, reactive astrogliosis, and perivascular microgliosis is
consistent with traumatic microvascular injury, blood–brain
barrier
disruption,
and
secondary
neuroinflammation

shear stress in the brain that localizes to (and persists in) a discrete region of brain ipsilateral and subjacent to the impact contact zone. Sustained
asymmetric shear stress in the simulation recapitulates the ipsilateral locus of post-traumatic brain pathology observed in the animal experiments.
Note that impact produces peak shear stress in the brain before onset of gross motion of the head. By contrast, blast exposure under conditions
that induces comparable head kinematics results in distributed loading on the head and lower magnitude shear stress in the brain. (I and J) Time

 2016; McKee et al., 2016). Notably, two of four brains
showed evidence of phosphorylated tauopathy and one case
qualified for neuropathological diagnosis of early stage CTE
(McKee et al., 2016). Clinicopathological correlation sug-
gested mechanistically causal linkage between early CTE
brain pathologies, including phosphorylated tauopathy, and
antecedent closed-head impact injury (Goldstein et al., 2012;
McKee et al., 2013; Kondo et al., 2015; Kenney et al., 2016).
Few published case series have investigated brain path-
ology in individuals who have sustained mild forms of
closed-head impact injury and died in the acute-subacute
period post-injury (Oppenheimer, 1968; Blumbergs et al.,
1994; McKee et al., 2014). Limitations pertinent to these
studies and ours include: (i) small number of cases; (ii) vari-
ation in mechanics, severity, and timing of head injury; (iii)
potential confounds associated with comorbidities, history
of prior neurotrauma, and genetic and medical risk factors;
(iv) duration and circumstances of the agonal period and
post-mortem interval; (v) incomplete case information; (vi)
adequacy of control brains; (vii) methodological and tech-
nical issues; (viii) exclusive male sex bias (this study); and
(ix) inherent limitations of clinicopathological correlation
to establish mechanistic causality (Goldstein et al., 2014;
Wojnarowicz et al., 2017).
Caveats notwithstanding, these case reports are highly
informative. Oppenheimer (1968) observed perivascular
microglia and astrocytes in proximity to petechial and
capillary
haemorrhages
as
early
as
15 h
post-injury
(Oppenheimer, 1968). Blumbergs et al. (1994) reported
post-traumatic axonopathy 2–99 days after mild concussive
head injury. The neuropathologies that we observed in
young athletes in the acute-subacute period after closed-
head impact injury included axonopathy, microvascular
disruption, and perivascular neuroinflammation are consist-
ent with the earlier reports. To this triad we highlight a
fourth element, phosphorylated tauopathy (Goldstein et al.,
2012; McKee et al., 2014). In the cases reported here, we
detected pathogenic accumulation of phosphorylated tau
protein accumulation in brains of two of four acute-sub-
acute head injury cases, one of which met diagnostic cri-
teria for early-stage CTE.
Clearly, not every individual who sustains a head injury,
even if repeated, will develop CTE brain pathology. While
clinicopathological correlation in our case series suggests
that closed-head impact injury can trigger early brain
pathologies associated with CTE, the causal mechanisms,
temporal relationships, and contextual circumstances that
link specific brain pathology to a particular antemortem
insult are impossible to ascertain with certainty based
solely on post-mortem neuropathology. This point is ger-
mane to the findings reported here given the documented
head injury exposure histories of the decedents. Rather, the
critical question addressed in this study is whether or not
antecedent head injury per se is sufficient to causally induce
(mechanistically determine) early CTE brain pathologies.
To investigate hypothesized causal connections between
impact injury and early CTE pathology, we developed a
mouse model of closed-head impact injury that uses mo-
mentum transfer to produce traumatic head acceleration
without gross skull deformation. The developed impact
mouse model is notable for matching head kinematics in
our previously published blast neurotrauma mouse model
(Goldstein
et
al.,
2012;
Kondo
et
al.,
2015).
Unanaesthetized (anaesthesia-naı
¨ve) mice subjected to uni-
lateral closed-head impact, but not experimental blast
exposure, exhibited abrupt onset of transient neurobeha-
vioural deficits with rapid and complete spontaneous reso-
lution. The observed deficits, temporal course, and rapid
recovery constitute an experimental concussion-like syn-
drome with phenomenological resemblance to human con-
cussion (Supplementary Video 1). We used the acute
neurobehavioural response test battery to objectively evalu-
ate these transient neurobehavioural deficits. It is important
to note that test battery composite and subtest scores cap-
ture integrated neurobehavioural performance that includes
neuromotor function (strength and coordination of prox-
imal, distal, and axial muscle groups), gait and balance,
locomotion, exploratory drive, arousal level, responsivity
to environmental stimuli, orientation behaviour, thigmo-
taxis, anxiety-neophobia, and habituation, amongst others
(Walsh and Cummins, 1976; Brooks and Dunnett, 2009;
Sukoff
Rizzo
and
Crawley,
2017).
Interestingly,
we
noted variation in the sensitivity of the subtests to discrim-
inate neurobehavioural impairment post-injury (i.e. open
field � inverted
mesh 4 beam
walk).
This
finding
may
prove useful in teasing out specific substrates, mechanisms,
and pathways underpinning particular concussive signs. We
also noted that left-lateral impact invariably produced
transient right-sided (contralateral) neuromotor deficits,
a finding consistent with hemispheric cross-lateralization
of cortical motor control. Furthermore, abrupt onset of
deficits was invariably followed by rapid and complete
neurological recovery that began within minutes after
injury. We did not observe persistent gross neurological
impairment, post-traumatic apnoea, skull fracture, status
epilepticus, cervical trauma, or spinal cord injury in any
of the more than 200 impact-injured mice used in this
study.
Given the absence of correlation between composite
scores on the test battery and TBI and CTE endpoints,
our results point to a disturbance of brain function (as
opposed to structural lesions) as the aetiological origin of
the
concussion-like
neurobehavioural
deficits
that
we
observed after impact injury. Our findings indicate that,
while impact injury and blast exposure elicit similar long-
term neuropathology and sequelae, these insults starkly dif-
ferentiate the concussion-like syndrome produced by the
former (impact), but not the latter (blast).
Several points deserve emphasis. First, the test battery
provides gross assessment of integrated neurobehavioural
performance across functional domains, including arousal,
anxiety-neophobia,
stimulus
responsivity,
exploratory
drive, locomotion, gait and balance, muscle strength, and
neuromotor coordination (Walsh and Cummins, 1976;

 Suarez and Gallup, 1981; Crawley, 1999; Brooks and
Dunnett, 2009). When deployed with repeated testing as
here, the test battery reliably elicits habituation, a simple
learning response that relies on recent memory (Walsh and
Cummins, 1976; Crawley, 1999). Second, the neurological
deficits that we observed post-injury model clinical features
of concussion in humans (Supplementary Video 1). This
similarity was underscored by phenomenological similari-
ties with respect to the abrupt onset, temporal progression,
transient course, and rapid resolution of acute deficits fol-
lowing impact. Third, despite tight control of the experi-
mental injury (Supplementary Table 2), we observed wide
individual variation in test battery scores. Moreover, vari-
ation in the severity of acute responses did not correlate
with impact intensity. Thus, sled velocity (between 3.75 m/s
and 6.25 m/s) did not significantly correlate with test bat-
tery composite scores (Spearman r = �0.16, P = 0.025,
n = 203). This finding supports findings in human athletes
that show wide variation in acute neurological responses
following sports-related head injuries (McCaffrey et al.,
2007; Broglio et al., 2010; Guskiewicz and Mihalik,
2011; Post and Hoshizaki, 2012). Fourth, we observed fur-
ther significant decrement in composite scores after second
impact (Fig. 2D) that showed significant positive correl-
ation with composite scores after first impact (Spearman
r = 0.52, P 5 0.0001, n = 203). These results are consistent
with reports in human athletes that show increased injury
susceptibility, severity, and sequelae after an index head
injury (Laurer et al., 2001; Prins et al., 2013; Terwilliger
et al., 2016).
Microscopic examination of brains from impact-injured
mice revealed evidence of focal microvasculopathy, blood–
brain barrier disruption, serum albumin extravasation,
astrocytosis, and reactive microgliosis. Flow cytometry
showed that post-traumatic neuroinflammation featured ac-
tivation of TREM2 + expression in brain-resident microglia
and presumptive infiltration of monocytes consistent with
recent experimental evidence of similar TREM2 activation
after open-skull cavitating TBI (Saber et al., 2016). That we
detected a similar pattern of neuroinflammation stimulated
by far milder closed-head impact injury suggests that
common and persistent response pathways may be trig-
gered across the brain injury spectrum. This point is under-
scored by a recent case study of repetitive head injuries on
the mild end of the spectrum (Cherry et al., 2016) and
comparison to more severe brain injury cases reported by
Strich (1956, 1961, 1970) and others (Gentleman et al.,
2004; Johnson et al., 2013a; Smith et al., 2013a; Cherry
et al., 2016).
Our results point to possible involvement of TREM2-
mediated microglial activation. TREM2 binds apolipopro-
tein E (Atagi et al., 2015) and also membrane lipids (Wang
et al., 2015), suggesting that this microglial receptor may
act as a surface sensor of damaged cell membranes
(Kleinberger et al., 2014; Phimister and Tanzi, 2015;
Ulrich and Holtzman, 2016). Significantly, the R47H
mutant TREM2 protein shows reduced binding to both
ligands (Atagi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) and is asso-
ciated with elevated risk of Alzheimer’s disease (Guerreiro
et al., 2013; Jonsson et al., 2013). In our study, mice sub-
jected to experimental impact showed dramatic microglia
phenotypic transformation and co-localizing accumulation
of inflammatory cells in the ipsilateral perirhinal cortex and
adjacent brain regions subjacent to the impact contact zone
(cf. Russo and McGavern, 2016). Recent evidence indicates
that microglial activation and exosomal processing are crit-
ical for spreading tauopathy (Asai et al., 2015). Moreover,
activated microglia induce a subset of reactive astrocytes
that promote neurodegeneration (Liddelow et al., 2017).
Consistent with these findings, we observed early, persist-
ent, and progressive cis-p-tauopathy that was initially de-
tectable only in axons of the ipsilateral perirhinal cortex
and later in axons, soma, and dendrites in cerebral cortex
in both hemispheres, including sites distant from the pri-
mary injury.
Our results comport with recent experiments that point
to somatodendritic miscompartmentalization as a driver
of extracellular tau release and transynaptic propagation
(Wu
et
al.,
2016).
Remarkably,
we
detected
cis-p-
tauopathy bilaterally in cerebral cortex 5.5 months after
unilateral impact. Moreover, tau proteinopathy detected
at this remote time point was present not only at the
primary locus of acute brain injury, but also at distant
sites in both hemispheres of the brain. The origin and
evolution of this tau pathology and relationship to the
inciting injury are as yet undetermined, but may in-
clude nucleation-dependent aggregation, seed-dependent
aggregation,
and
prion-like
transcellular
spread
(Clavaguera et al., 2009; Jucker and Walker, 2013;
Goedert, 2015; Woerman et al., 2016; Goedert et al.,
2017).
It is notable that we did not observe mature neurofibril-
lary tangles in brains from impact-injured mice at any time
point post-injury. This finding is consistent with other stu-
dies conducted in non-transgenic mice that express murine
tau protein (Goldstein et al., 2012; Huber et al., 2013;
Mannix et al., 2013; Petraglia et al., 2014; Kondo et al.,
2015). This discordance may reflect incomplete phenotypic
expression (forme fruste) resulting from the high solubility
and aggregation resistance of native murine tau protein, or
alternatively, protracted time dependencies beyond the ex-
perimental design of the present studies. Nevertheless, phos-
phorylated tau proteoforms, especially cis-p-tau as reported
here, are potent drivers of microtubule disruption, mito-
chondrial dysfunction, spreading tauopathy, and neurode-
generation in laboratory animals and humans (Nakamura
et al., 2012; Kondo et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016). Early
accumulation,
somatodendritic
miscompartmentalization,
and persistence of cis-p-tau suggest that aberrant accumula-
tion of this (and likely other) pathogenic phosphorylated tau
species may represent the earliest antecedent pathology of
CTE.

lation of phosphorylated tau protein in the depths of

(Tomkins et al., 2007), reduced GABAergic inhibition,
and impaired neuronal plasticity (Lippmann et al., 2017).
That extravasated serum albumin co-localized with reactive
astrocytosis is consistent with activation of this injury re-
sponse pathway and suggests plausible targets for thera-
peutic intervention that are now under investigation.
This same pathway affords potential as a diagnostic neu-
roimaging marker for traumatic microvascular injury, an
understudied TBI endophenotype. We combined dynamic
contrast-enhanced brain imaging (Veksler et al., 2014;
Weissberg et al., 2014) with systemic administration of
gadofosveset trisodium, a gadolinium-containing contrast
agent that binds serum albumin (Richardson et al., 2015),
to detect blood–brain barrier disruption in living mice. TBI-
induced gadofosveset accumulated in ipsilateral perirhinal
cortex and co-localized with T1-weighted hyperintensities
and blood–brain barrier permeability defects that we con-
firmed by metallomic imaging mass spectrometry brain
mapping.
Collectively, our neuropathological and ultrastructural
findings are consistent with impact-induced microvascular
dysfunction rather than traumatic intraparenchymal haem-
orrhage. Blood–brain barrier disruption is associated with
neuronal glutamate release (Vazana et al., 2016), pericyte
degeneration (Bell et al., 2010), astrocytic end-feet swelling
and capillary retraction (Ito et al., 2011; Goldstein et al.,
2012). These factors promote blood–brain barrier com-
promise, local hypoxia, perivascular neuroinflammation,
synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration (Barkhou-
darian et al., 2016) (Fig. 8B). Our results not only provide
supportive evidence for blood–brain barrier disruption as a
clinically-relevant
post-traumatic
endophenotype
(Hay
et al., 2015; Doherty et al., 2016; Kenney et al., 2016),
but also serve as justification for clinical evaluation of dy-
namic neuroimaging with gadofosveset as a novel diagnos-
tic test for traumatic microvascular injury and presumptive
risk factor test for CTE.
We were surprised that unilateral impact was accompa-
nied by persistent bilateral impairments in hippocampal
axonal conduction and medial prefrontal cortical synaptic
plasticity. These findings represent post-traumatic func-
tional sequelae that comport with experimental and clinical
evidence indicating
neurophysiological
abnormalities
in
athletes and laboratory animals in the acute-subacute
period after closed-head impact injuries (Goldstein et al.,
2012; De Beaumont et al., 2013; Namjoshi et al., 2014;
Kondo et al., 2015; Major et al., 2015). Loss of white
matter structural and functional integrity has been reported
in patients following closed-head impact injury (Blennow
et al., 2012; Shenton et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2013a).
These effects may be mediated by direct axonal injury
(Strich, 1961; Adams et al., 1982; Gennarelli et al., 1982;
Povlishock and Christman, 1995), Wallerian degeneration,
axonal
transport
dysfunction,
post-traumatic
demyelin-
ation, microvascular injury, pathogenic phosphorylated
tau protein aggregation, or a combination of these and
other factors (Fig. 8B and C).
Our observation that closed-head impact injury also dis-
rupts prefrontal cortical projection neuron synaptic plasti-
city suggests that acute neurotrauma may interfere with
N-methyl D-aspartate glutamate receptor activation, intra-
cellular second messengers, gene expression, protein synthe-
sis,
and/or
post-translational
modifications
that
are
required for LTP-dependent memory mechanisms (Sweatt
et al., 2016). Aberrant neurophysiological responses in
the
hippocampal-prefrontal
cortex
network
(Xu
and
Su
¨dhof, 2013; Sigurdsson and Duvarci, 2015; Place et al.,
2016) are plausible substrates for cognitive, affective, atten-
tional, and executive disturbances associated with post-con-
cussive syndrome (Evans, 2006), traumatic encephalopathy
syndrome (Montenigro et al., 2014), and post-traumatic
stress disorder (Mahan and Ressler, 2012). Bilateral elec-
trophysiological deficits detected in our study are notable
for the anatomical distance of the hippocampus and medial
prefrontal cortex from the primary locus of injury path-
ology. In our previous blast TBI study (Goldstein et al.,
2012) we observed similar impairments in hippocampal
axonal
conduction
velocity
and
hippocampal
LTP.
Intriguingly, we detected ultrastructural evidence of persist-
ent microvascular injury in both the hippocampus and
medial prefrontal cortex. Recent evidence also indicates
that neurophysiological deficits, including impaired LTP
in vitro and memory dysfunction in vivo, may be precipi-
tated by pathogenic accumulation of phosphorylated tau
protein (Sydow et al., 2011; Kondo et al., 2015; Fa
´
et al., 2016). The relationship of tau proteinopathy to
post-traumatic neurophysiological sequelae awaits further
investigation.
Experimental closed-head impact injury in this study
involved contact with the temporomandibular region of
the head and force loading across the zygomatic arch of
the skull. In the mouse, the zygomatic process and squas-
mosal converge over the lateral perirhinal cortex. Gross
pathology observed in impact-injured mice comports with
classical coup injury biomechanics as documented in analo-
gous brain pathology after impact injuries in humans

Figure 8 Model of traumatic microvascular injury, blood–brain barrier disruption, microglial activation, perivascular neu-
roinflammation, myelinated axonopathy, and phosphorylated tauopathy after closed-head impact injury. (A) Brain capillary with
intact blood–brain barrier and neurovascular unit. The contents within the capillary lumen include blood plasma, blood proteins (including serum
albumin, salb) and formed elements (red blood cells, rbc; circulating monocytes, mono; other white blood cells and platelets, not shown). The
capillary luminal wall is a structurally continuous sheath formed by endothelial cell membranes that are joined at intercellular clefts by tight
junction complexes (tjc). The basal lamina separates endothelial cells from pericytes, multifunctional mural cells that support microvascular and
neurovascular unit function. Astrocyte endfeet ensheath the abluminal capillary wall. The neurovascular unit comprises endothelial cells, astro-
cytes, pericytes, neurons, and extracellular matrix components that regulate blood–brain barrier function, gas exchange, and bidirectional transit
of fluid, metabolites, nutrients, and signalling molecules between the blood and brain. (B) Injured brain capillary after neurotrauma. (1)
Intraparenchymal shearing forces initiated by focal mechanical injury disrupt local microvascular structure and blood–brain barrier functional
integrity. (2) Compensatory changes in the extracellular matrix, elaboration and expansion of the basal lamina, formation of stress granules,
inclusion bodies, and autophagosomic vacuoles are indicative of traumatic microvascular injury and post-traumatic repair and remodelling. (3)
Astrocytic endfoot engorgement (astrocytic hydrops), organelle degradation (autophagy, mitophagy), and vacuolization are prominent ultra-
structural features of capillaries damaged by neurotrauma. Perivascular astrocytes assume a reactive phenotype with concomitant loss of endfoot
organellar integrity and secondary fluid accumulation (presumably from vascular fluid transit and pump failure or endfoot membrane loss).
Together these processes lead to loss of cellular polarity and astrocyte endfoot retraction (involution) along the abluminal capillary wall. (4)
Post-traumatic alterations in microvascular structure further compromise blood–brain barrier integrity and promote extravasation of pro-
inflammatory plasma proteins (e.g. serum albumin, salb) into the brain parenchyma. Damaged capillaries may also facilitate inflammatory cell
diapedesis and red blood cell transit (microhaemorrhage) into the brain parenchymal. (5) Serum albumin and other blood proteins (e.g.
fibrinogen) are highly stimulatory to astrocytes, microglia, and CNS-resident macrophage and drive cellular transformation from resting to
reactive phenotypes. These and other molecular triggers induce local activation and phenotypic transformation of brain-resident microglia,
including increased expression of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), an innate immune receptor expressed on the
surface of activated microglia. Microglial TREM2 expression may be accompanied by endoproteolytic cleavage of the TREM2 ectodomain and
shedding of the resulting cleavage product (sTREM2). Our results indicate that post-traumatic microglial activation and phenotypic transformation
precede infiltration and accumulation of peripheral inflammatory cells at sites of focal brain injury. Localized clusters of hemosiderin-laden
macrophage represent chronic residua of prior microhaemorrhage. (6) Secondary changes in neurons triggered by neurotrauma lead to axo-
nopathy (e.g. demyelination, blebbing, axonal transport dysfunction, phosphorylated tau protein aggregation), dendritic denuding, hyperexcitability,
synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. (7) Tau protein dissociates from microtubules, undergoes pathogenic phosphorylation (p-tau),
aggregates abnormally within axons, and stimulates pathogenic transport to and miscompartmentalization within the soma and dendrites of

 2017). Virtually all mice subjected to experimental impact
in this study demonstrated transient neurobehavioural def-
icits that bear striking resemblance to the spectrum of con-
cussion-related responses in humans. By contrast, and to
our surprise, mice exposed to blast under conditions
matched for head kinematics did not exhibit acute neuro-
behavioural deficits post-injury (Goldstein et al., 2012).
This unexpected observation argues against the concept
that kinematic variables are primary determinants of con-
cussive
phenomena
(Denny-Brown
and
Russell,
1941;
Shaw, 2002). Rather, our experimental and computational
results suggest that the observed acute neurobehavioural
responses to closed-head impact injury are triggered by
force point loading and intraparenchymal shear stress foci
in the cerebral cortex that occur before onset of gross head
motion.
These observations are consistent with the following pos-
tulated mechanistic sequence based on reported experimen-
tal findings. Cortical shear stresses triggered by impact elicit
rapid neuronal membrane depolarization, massive glutam-
ate release, and metabolic dyshomeostasis (Faden et al.,
1989; Katayama et al., 1990; Yoshino et al., 1991) in cere-
bral cortex ipsilateral to injury. Released glutamate acti-
vates excitatory amino acids receptors that elicit further
depolarization by altering Na + and Ca2 + gating properties
and opening voltage-sensitive ion channels that amplify
transmembrane
cation fluxes (Hemphill
et al.,
2015).
These responses interfere with synaptic neurotransmission,
thereby inducing transient loss of contralateral motor
strength, tone, and coordination as well as impairing vege-
tative brain functions controlling attention, arousal, and
affect. Neurophysiological function is restored following
neurotransmitter reuptake and synaptic recovery, consistent
with our observations of abrupt onset and rapid recovery
of neurobehavioural deficits post-injury. Mechanical mem-
brane deformation can directly open stretch-sensitive chan-
nels that produce aberrant ion fluxes (Hemphill et al.,
2015) and intracellular Ca2 +
dyshomeostasis (Gurkoff
et al., 2012; Barkhoudarian et al., 2016). Sudden changes
in local ion concentrations can trigger spreading depolar-
ization (Dreier, 2011; Lippmann et al., 2017) and post-
traumatic seizure (Annegers et al., 1998). While post-trau-
matic seizure was rare in our animal experiments (51% of
impact-injured mice), when present these events invariably
evolved as a classical Jacksonian march noted first on the
right side contralateral to left-sided impact with progression
to generalized tonic-clonic seizure followed by post-ictal
immobility. This pattern is consistent with a left-sided
motor cortex seizure focus. Taken together, our results in-
dicate that the transient neurobehavioural impairments trig-
gered by impact result from disruption of cortical function
rather than damage to cortical structures, and as such,
agree with neuronal excitation theories of concussion
(Denny-Brown and Russell, 1941; Walker et al., 1944;
Shaw, 2002).
Interactions between the functional and structural effects
of neurotrauma are complex, dynamic, bidirectional, and
dependent on a variety of injury-related factors, including
type, rate, intensity, geometry, location, and biomechanics
of the inciting insult. Specifically, we found that different
types of neurotrauma produce varying levels of concussive
functional effects. Furthermore, we observed wide variation
in acute neurological responses within a single mode of
head injury (i.e. impact) (Fig. 2E and F). Moreover, we
found that variation in acute functional responses in our
experimental animal model did not correlate with any of
the measured quantitative indices that we used to assess
brain injury and CTE-related sequelae (Supplementary
Table 3). We interpret these findings as evidence supporting
interactive linkage rather than dissociation between func-
tional and structural consequences of neurotrauma. This
point is underscored by the fact that functional effects of
head injury, including neurophysiological responses under-
pinning concussion, are capable of potentiating structural
changes and secondary alterations that lead to further brain
injury and neurological sequelae. For example, sudden re-
lease of glutamate in the brain, intracellular calcium dysre-
gulation,
and
spreading
depolarization
triggered
by
neurotrauma are all known precipitants of metabolic dys-
homeostasis, neurotoxicity, neuronal dysfunction, and neu-
rodegeneration (Dreier et al., 2006; Lau and Tymianski,
2010; Dreier, 2011; Hartings et al., 2011; Prins et al.,
2013; Giza and Hovda, 2014; Pietrobon and Moskowitz,
2014; Lewerenz and Maher, 2015; Østergaard et al., 2015;
Barkhoudarian et al., 2016; Rogers et al., 2017). From this
perspective, concussion can be viewed as an observable
clinical manifestation that reflects a spectrum of altered
neurological functional states that may or may not be asso-
ciated with antecedent structural brain injury. Moreover, the
neurobiological conditions underpinning these concussive

spread may proceed via extracellular, paracellular, transcellular, and/or glympathic mechanisms. (C) Schematic representation of the axonal
compartment of a healthy neuron (left) and traumatized neuron (right). In healthy neurons, tau protein associates with and stabilizes microtubules
in axons and dendrites. In traumatized neurons, tau protein dissociates from microtubules and undergoes aberrant phosphorylation. P-tau is
prone to pathogenic oligomerization, aggregation, and accumulation within axons, terminals, dendrites, spines, and soma of affected neurons.
Miscompartmentalization of abnormally processed phosphorylated tau promotes release and transmission of p-tau species that contribute to
progressive neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. (D) Internal force lines (red) show increased stress concentration at structural dishomo-
geneities in the brain. Anatomical features such as capillaries (cap), depths of cortical sulci, and grey-white matter interfaces are subject to shear
stress amplification (stress concentration) and focal mechanical trauma (arrows). See text for details and discussion.

 states may, ipso facto, alter ongoing metabolic, homeostatic,
cellular, and electrophysiological responses, thereby modu-
lating
post-traumatic
brain
function
and
neurological
sequelae.
We note several unexpected findings pertinent to the ori-
gins of concussion and relationships to TBI and CTE. First,
we did not detect a correlation between impact intensity
(sled velocity) and acute neurobehavioural responses to
mild closed-head impact injury. Second, acute responses
to experimental impact injury did not correlate with TBI
and CTE endpoints. Specifically, composite scores on the
test battery did not correlate with quantitative endpoints of
blood–brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, neuro-
physiological defects, or phosphorylated tauopathy. Finally,
we observed dissociation between the mechanism of experi-
mental neurotrauma (impact versus blast) and induction of
acute neurobehavioural deficits. Mice subjected to impact
injury reliably demonstrated transient concussion-like im-
pairments, whereas mice exposed to blast with comparable
head motion did not.
Computational simulations revealed dramatic differences
in the evolution of shear stress in the head and brain during
impact compared to blast. Specifically, our results point to
differences in shear (von Mises) stress as the primary driver
of acute neurobehavioural impairments triggered by impact
injury. Indeed, we found 7-fold larger intracerebral shear
(von Mises) stress during impact compared to blast under
conditions matched for head kinematics. The differences in
intracerebral shear stress (and differential propensity for
acute impairments) derived from distinct loading conditions
in the two types of neurotrauma. For blast, airflow around
the skull produces relatively uniform pressure on the head
(Fig. 7F) that does not generate significant shear stress in
the brain. By contrast, impact produces focally-concen-
trated point loading at the impact site. Non-uniform
point loading on the head creates significant shear stress
in the brain that persists in a focal region of the brain
ipsilateral and subjacent to the impact contact zone. Focal
shear persistence results from extremely low shear wave
velocity in the brain (Fig. 7G). Intracerebral shear stresses
predicted by impact simulation is in the order of hundreds
of Pascals, a value well above reported thresholds for dis-
ruption of brain cell homeostasis (Ravin et al., 2012;
Maneshi et al., 2015). Our results suggest that trauma-
induced disturbances in brain function may occur in the
absence of overt structural brain pathology. While focal
shear stresses in the brain may be important for produc-
tion of concussion-like neurobehavioural responses in an
animal model of closed-head impact injury, the neuro-
logical consequences of this biomechanical perturbation
may not be limited to acute brain dysfunction. Rather,
our data suggest that exposure to focal shear stress may
also be associated with structural brain injury and its
aftermath.
The differential biomechanical effects of impact and blast
suggest possible substrates and mechanisms that underpin
and link concussion, TBI, and sequelae. While experimental
impact injury and blast exposure both trigger TBI and
early CTE brain pathologies, only impact induced acute
concussion-like neurobehavioural deficits. Computational
simulations showed that impact induced point loading on
the head and asymmetric shear stress in the brain, whereas
blast exposure, under conditions matched for head kine-
matics, led to diffuse loading with 7-fold lower intracereb-
ral shear stress. Our results indicate that the primary
biomechanical determinant driving impact-induced acute
neurological deficits is focally-concentrated shear stress
that arises in the cerebral cortex before onset of gross
head motion. By contrast, structural brain injury, focal
pathologies,
and
functional
sequelae
correlate
with
slower-acting inertial forces associated with head motion
(Holbourn, 1943; Goldstein et al., 2012; Ghajari et al.,
2017).
Shear stress within the brain is subject to localized
amplification (stress concentration) due to structural an-
isotropy and inhomogeneities (Ommaya and Gennarelli,
1974;
Gennarelli
et
al.,
1993;
Cloots
et
al.,
2008;
Ghajari et al., 2017). Specific anatomical features that
contribute to stress concentration (e.g. depths of cortical
sulci, grey–white matter interfaces, microvascular-brain
parenchyma junctures; Fig. 8D) also represent brain struc-
tures that exhibit the greatest burden of TBI- and CTE-
related neuropathology (McKee et al., 2016; Ghajari
et al., 2017; Holleran et al., 2017). These same structures
are also vulnerable to repeated injury, especially if subse-
quent neurotrauma is sustained during brain recovery
(Laurer et al., 2001; Prins et al., 2013). Prior brain
injury is well known to increase risk of subsequent
injury, slower recovery, poorer outcomes, and in rare
cases,

(Cantu,
1998;
Guskiewicz et al., 2003; Evans, 2006; Mannix et al.,

Limitations of the animal experiments include use of
young adult male C57BL/6 mice subjected to a single-
repeat unilateral impact at one injury intensity and evalu-
ated exclusively in the acute-subacute period post-injury
(with exception of cis-p-tauopathy that was evaluated 5.5
months post-injury). While comparing murine and human
ages is fraught with complications (Spear, 2004; Flurkey
et al., 2007), the selected age range represents an informed
choice
that
balances
age
as
a
function
of
longevity
(Hedrich,
2012),
maturational
comparability
to
the
human cases and previous studies (Goldstein et al., 2012;

ment, skull thickness, and brain development (Kobayashi
et al., 1963; Flurkey et al., 2007; Counotte et al., 2010;
Hedrich, 2012; Smith et al., 2017). Importantly, white
matter microglia reached adult distribution and phenotype
at the selected mouse age, a factor of particular significance
for the neuroinflammation analyses. The selected murine
age range is consistent with sexual maturity, attainment
of adult body weight and skull thickness, and completion
of major brain development milestones. By these metrics,
mice in this study were roughly comparable in age to the

 human cases. Interpretation and generalizability of our
animal experiments are constrained by animal subject
homogeneity (strain, genotype, age, and sex) as well as
species differences in physiology, metabolism, and anatomy
(skull
deformability,
spine
stability,
cervical
range
of
motion).
Another limitation of the animal model centres on the
definition of concussion (Angoa-Pe
´rez et al., 2014; Semple
et al., 2015; Giza et al., 2017; McCrory et al., 2017;
Wojnarowicz et al., 2017). Our working definition of con-
cussion is based on observable neurobehavioural signs that
are primarily, but not exclusively, related to neuromotor
function. Impaired balance and gait are considered part
of the constellation of signs associated with sports-related
concussion (McCrory et al., 2017), and accordingly, were
rigorously evaluated in this study. However, other promin-
ent clinical features of concussion—cognitive impairment,
amnestic
deficits,
disorientation,
slowed
reaction
time,
headache, emotional lability, alterations in consciousness,
somnolence and sleep disturbances—were not amenable
to experimental evaluation using the current version of
the acute neurobehavioural response test battery. These
limitations warrant caution with respect to generalizing ex-
perimental findings in laboratory animals to clinical condi-
tions in humans. Future studies will benefit from inclusion
of test battery components that are sensitive to specific al-
terations in cognitive, affective, and behavioural domains
that are affected by concussion in humans.
Additional limitations apply to the computational simu-
lations. We considered effects on and within a computa-
tionally simplified headform, while neglecting contributions
of neck and torso tethering to the body. However, with
respect to the calculated timescales of interest, we observed
pronounced shear stresses prior to onset of gross head
motion when tethering effects would not be significant.
We also assumed a simplified spherical head with concen-
tric material layers of skull and CSF without dura or soft
tissues, as well as isotropic brain composition without in-
ternal structure. We note that a more complex anatomical
description
would
not
have
changed
the
conclusions
deduced from the simulations. In addition, we only con-
sidered a single set of initial conditions for the impact
and blast simulations. Future studies in which the magni-
tude of shear forces within a single model is systematically
varied may yield additional information germane to estab-
lishing causal links between loading conditions during
injury and its aftermath. Moreover, the temporal relation-
ships between initiation and propagation of shear stress
foci in the brain and onset of acute neurological responses
remain to be empirically validated in vivo. Despite these
caveats, the computational simulations closely agreed with
experimental head kinematics and support mechanistic ex-
planations that comport with simple biomechanical prin-
ciples and clinical observations.
Based on this evidence, we conclude that the mechanisms
underpinning the transient concussion-like deficits observed
in mice after experimental closed-head impact are triggered
by fast-acting, high-amplitude shear stress fields that arise
in the cerebral cortex before onset of gross head motion.
Our results also suggest that concussion, TBI, and CTE
represent distinct nosological entities subserved by different
pathobiological mechanisms. Specifically, our findings indi-
cate that closed-head impact injury, independent of concus-
sion, represents a potent insult with potential to induce
enduring
neurophysiological
dysfunction
and
persistent
(and possibly progressive) sequelae, including CTE brain
pathology.
Furthermore,
our
findings
from
blast
and
impact support the concept that disparate types of neuro-
trauma with distinct injury mechanisms and differing po-
tential
for
concussion
can
trigger
convergent
brain
pathologies and functional sequelae.
Collectively, these results raise concern that repetitive
neurotrauma,
independent
of
concussion,
may
induce
early CTE brain pathologies, even in teenagers and young
adults. Cumulative exposure to such injuries may also in-
crease risk for other tau protein neurodegenerative diseases,
including Alzheimer’s disease (Stein et al., 2015b). These
considerations are important not only for understanding
and differentiating concussion, TBI, and CTE, but also to
inform
clinical
practice,
return-to-play
protocols,
and
public health policy.
This study also raises many questions. How much tau
pathology is clinically significant? What is the relationship
of specific tau species and other molecular and cellular
pathologies to latent brain disease and chronic sequelae
triggered by brain injury? How do pathogenic tau proteo-
forms propagate through the brain and can this process be
prevented or reversed? Which clinical biomarkers are best
suited for diagnostic detection, endophenotype differenti-
ation, prognostic stratification, and longitudinal monitoring
of TBI and CTE? Animal models that recapitulate clinical
features of concussion, TBI, and CTE provide a powerful
platform to address these issues. We anticipate that answers
to these questions will facilitate development of new diag-
nostics, therapeutics, protective equipment, and preventive
measures
for
acute
and
chronic
effects
of
impact
neurotrauma.
