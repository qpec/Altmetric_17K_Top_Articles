Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a major public health issue. The goal of this study was to assess the clin-
ical use of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) evaluated by supersonic shear imaging (SSI), FibroScan, and acoustic radiation
force impulse (ARFI) in a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent liver biopsy. A total of 291 NAFLD patients were pro-
spectively enrolled from November 2011 to February 2015 at 2 French university hospitals. LSM was assessed by SSI, Fibro-
Scan (M probe), and ARFI within two weeks prior to liver biopsy. Calculations of the area under the receiver operating curve
(AUROC) were performed and compared for the staging of liver fibrosis. AUROC for SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI were 0.86,
0.82, and 0.77 for diagnoses of �F2; 0.89, 0.86, and 0.84 for �F3; and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 for F4, respectively. SSI had a
higher accuracy than ARFI for diagnoses of significant fibrosis (�F2) (P 5 0.004). Clinical factors related to obesity such as
body mass index � 30 kg/m2, waist circumference �102 cm or increased parietal wall thickness were associated with LSM fail-
ures when using SSI or FibroScan and with unreliable results when using ARFI. In univariate analysis, FibroScan values were
slightly correlated with NAFLD activity score and steatosis (R 5 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), whereas SSI and ARFI were
not; however, these components of NAFLD did not affect LSM results in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values for SSI and
FibroScan for staging fibrosis with a sensitivity �90% were very close: 6.3/6.2 kPa for �F2, 8.3/8.2 kPa for �F3, and 10.5/9.5
kPa for F4. Conclusion: Although obesity is associated with an increase in LSM failure, the studied techniques and especially
SSI provide high value for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis in NAFLD patients. (HEPATOLOGY 2016;63:1817-1827)

s a result of the growing obesity epidemic,
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has
become a major public health issue. NAFLD
currently represents the leading cause of chronic liver
disease in Western countries and the second leading
etiology among adults awaiting liver transplantation in
the United States.(1-3) Liver-related morbidity and
mortality in NAFLD patients are linked to the devel-
opment
of
nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis
(NASH),
which can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis lesions.(4)
NASH is also associated with an increased risk of

increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and type 2
diabetes mellitus.(5) Liver biopsy is considered the gold

 standard for the evaluation and quantification of liver
fibrosis in NAFLD patients. However, this diagnostic
method is invasive and often painful and can be associ-
ated with rare but severe complications.(6)
The development of noninvasive diagnostic tools to
assess liver fibrosis has been an increasingly studied
area of research. In recent years, several noninvasive
diagnostic tools, based on liver stiffness measurement
(LSM) methods such as FibroScan (Echosens, Paris,
France), acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI, Sie-
mens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, CA) elas-
tography,
and
supersonic
shear
imaging
(SSI,
Supersonic Shear Imagine, Aix-en-Provence, France)
have been developed to quantify liver fibrosis through
the measurement of mechanical or ultrasound shear
wave propagation through the hepatic parenchyma.
Numerous studies have confirmed the efficiency and
reproducibility of these techniques in the diagnosis of
severe fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients affected by a
chronic viral hepatitis.(7-12) NAFLD is a challenge for
these noninvasive techniques based on a physical
approach, as the increased soft tissue/fat in obese
patients leads to a poorer transmission of the ultra-
sound or mechanical beam, leading to failures in
measurements or unreliable results. For FibroScan,
failures of measurement or noninterpretable results
occur in 5% and 15% of cases, respectively, with the
main limiting factor being obesity.(13) ARFI elastog-
raphy demonstrates a decrease in its diagnostic per-
formances
that
increases
with
the
extent
of
overweight.(14) Regarding the SSI technique, no study
has focused on the effects of overweight on its diag-
nostic performance for assessing liver fibrosis. Because
overweight and NAFLD are intimately linked, it is
important to question how this new technique behaves
in NAFLD/NASH patients. Moreover, the impact
on liver stiffness of major components of NAFLD
such as steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte bal-
looning remains unclear.
The aim of this study was to prospectively compare
the diagnostic accuracy of SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI
for the staging of fibrosis in NAFLD-related chronic
liver disease using liver histology as the reference
standard.
Patients and Methods
PATIENTS
We prospectively enrolled consecutive adult patients
with NAFLD who had undergone liver biopsy from
November 2011 to February 2015. Patients were
recruited from two French academic centers (the Uni-
versity Hospital of Angers and University Hospital of
Bordeaux) that act as tertiary centers for the manage-
ment of liver diseases (108 patients recruited from the
University Hospital of Bordeaux had been included in
a previous study comparing several noninvasive tests in
patients with chronic liver diseases of mixed etiolo-
gies).(12) Included were patients who had LSM per-
formed using SSI, ARFI, and FibroScan within the 2
weeks before liver biopsy. Exclusion criteria were high
alcohol consumption (i.e., >21 drinks, on average, per
week in men and >14 drinks, on average, per week in
women),(4,15) associated causes of liver disease (alco-
holic, viral, or other causes of liver injury), and a liver
biopsy length of <10 mm and/or fewer than six portal
spaces and/or more than two fragments, except in cases
of cirrhosis. All physicians who performed LSM
experiments were blinded to the results of other nonin-
vasive methods and liver biopsies. An ethics committee
approved the design of this cross-sectional study, and

patients.
LIVER HISTOLOGICAL
EXAMINATION
Histopathological staging for liver fibrosis served as
the reference standard. Liver biopsies were fixed in for-
malin and embedded in paraffin. All biopsy specimens
were analyzed by one of three pathologists who special-
ized in liver diseases and were blinded to the noninva-
sive test results. Fibrosis was staged according to the
NASH Clinical Research Network scoring system(16)
as follows: stage 0 (F0), absence of fibrosis; stage 1
(F1), perisinusoidal or portal; stage 2 (F2), perisinusoi-
dal and portal/periportal; stage 3 (F3), septal or bridg-
ing fibrosis; stage 4 (F4), cirrhosis. The grade of
steatosis
was
also
defined
according
to
Kleiner
et al.(16): S0, <5%; S1, 5%-33% (mild); S2, 34%-66%
(moderate); and S3, >67% (marked). Disease activity
was quantified using the NAFLD activity score
(NAS), which is based on the severity of steatosis (0-
3), inflammation (0-3), and hepatocellular ballooning
(0-2).
MORPHOLOGICAL AND
BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS
For all patients, the following parameters were
determined at the time of liver stiffness measurement.
Clinical parameters included age, sex, body mass index
(BMI), waist circumference, history of diabetes, and
hypertension. A blood sample was obtained to quantify
the platelet count, prothrombin time, total bilirubin
levels, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, aspartate
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline
phosphatase, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, and
HDL cholesterol levels. Intercostal wall thickness was
also measured in millimeters during liver ultrasound
examination.
SSI
SSI is integrated into a conventional ultrasound
device
(Aixplorer,
Supersonic
Imagine,
Aix-en-
Provence, France). Using radiation force and ultrafast
ultrasound imaging, the supersonic shear imaging
technique allows one to remotely generate and follow a
transient plane shear wave that is propagating in vivo
in real time. The radial forces that generate the shear
wave are focused at increasing depths, causing a shear
wave front that propagates in the area scanned. The
same emitting probe receives, at high frequency, the
propagation speed data from the shear waves, allowing
for the updating, in real time, of the received data.
Each sequence of three shear wave fronts lasts approxi-
mately one second. The tissue shear modulus, repre-
senting its stiffness, can be estimated from the shear
wave local velocity. The ultrasound system then gener-
ates a real-time color map of the elasticity encoded
pixel by pixel in an image superimposed on the stand-
ard B-mode.(17,18)
One of six experienced abdominal imaging radiolog-
ists performed SSI examinations in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions. LSM was performed
through intercostal spaces while the patient was lying
in dorsal decubitus with the right arm in maximal
abduction. The operator, who was assisted by a real-
time B-mode ultrasound image, targeted under apnea,
a region of the right lobe of the liver with good spatial
resolution for B-mode ultrasound imaging. Once a
color map with complete and homogeneous filling was
obtained in the zone, a region of interest 15 mm in
diameter was positioned in the center of the color map
in a zone free of large vascular structures and at least
15 mm below the capsule. As described in the litera-
ture and in accordance with the manufacturer’s recom-
mendations, fewer than 10 values were used for SSI
technique.(11,19) Five measurements were performed
on each patient. The median value of the five SSI
measurements
(with
their
interquartile
range)
expressed in kilopascals was used as the representative
measurement. Measurements were classified as failed
when no or little signal was obtained in the SSI box for
all acquisitions. Because no reliability criteria have
been validated for SSI or ARFI techniques, we applied
the reliability criteria of FibroScan for the three techni-
ques used in this study.(20) SSI results were then con-
sidered as unreliable when the interquartile range
(IQR)/LSM was >0.30 in patients with LSM � 7.1
kPa.
FIBROSCAN
Transient elastography was performed with Fibro-
Scan (Echosens, Paris, France) using the standard
probe (also named the M probe). Examinations were
performed by one of three trained nurses (with experi-
ence performing more than 5000 LSM) blinded to
SSI, ARFI, and biological results. The objective was to
obtain a total of 10 valid measurements (defined as a
successful liver stiffness measurement examination),
HEPATOLOGY, Vol. 63, No. 6, 2016
CASSINOTTO ET AL.
1819
 with the maximum number of attempts set at 20. Liver
stiffness evaluation was considered as unreliable when
IQR/LSM was >0.30 in patients with LSM � 7.1
kPa.(20)
ARFI
ARFI imaging was performed by one of the six radi-
ologists noted above who did not perform the SSI
examination. Each investigator had more than 2 years
of experience in ARFI elastography. Details of the
technique and the examination procedure have been
described in previous reports.(21) ARFI elastography is
integrated into a conventional ultrasound device (Acu-
son S2000, Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain
View, CA). ARFI was performed under the same con-
ditions as SSI but in patients with apnea or with quiet
breathing. Ten valid measurements were performed on
each patient. The median value was determined as the
representative measurement. In extension of the reli-
ability rules applied for FibroScan, unreliable results
were defined as an IQR/LSM > 30% in patients with
LSM � 1.54 m/s.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis was performed using NCSS 9
(NCSS software, Kaysville, UT). Data were expressed
as the mean 6 standard deviation or the median
(IQR) and compared using either the two-sample t
test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, according to
data distribution. Percentages were compared using
the v2 test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The
influence of different factors on LSM failures or unre-
liable results was analyzed using logistic regression.
The influence of clinical, biological and histological
factors on LSM was analyzed using stepwise forward
multiple regression. For independent variables, we
selected those that influenced each dependent variable
that was studied according to the univariate analysis
with P < 0.1. The diagnostic performances of nonin-
vasive tests were assessed in a per-protocol strategy
(i.e., with exclusion of failed measurements and unreli-
able results) by correlating tests results and histological
fibrosis stage using the nonparametric Spearman corre-
lation coefficient, the results of which were compared
with each other according to Guilford et al.,(22) and by
building receiver operating characteristics curves. Areas
under the receiver operating characteristics curves
(AUROCs) and the 95% confidence intervals of the
AUROC values were calculated for the detection of
histological fibrosis stage 2 or higher (F � 2), fibrosis
stage 3 or higher (F � 3), and cirrhosis (F4). Optimal
cutoff values were determined for SSI, FibroScan, and
ARFI to predict significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and
cirrhosis according to at least 90% sensitivity, at least
90% specificity, the Youden index (maximum sum of
sensitivity and specificity), and the best diagnostic
accuracy (i.e., the maximum sum of true positives and
true negatives over the total number of patients).
Finally, AUROC values for noninvasive tests were
compared using the paired method described by Zhou
et al.(23) Because multiple pairwise tests were per-
formed on a single set of data, Bonferroni correction
was used to reduce the risks of false-positive results. A
Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of 0.0167 was
calculated for the comparison of AUROC values for
SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI.
Results
From November 2011 to February 2015, 328
NAFLD patients underwent liver biopsy and LSM.
Fourteen patients were excluded due to a liver biopsy
length < 10 mm, and 23 patients were excluded
because one of the three elastographic methods was
not available at the time of the measurements due to
the unavailability of ultrasound devices (defective
device or maintenance). Finally, 291 patients having
had LSM with SSI, M probe of FibroScan, and ARFI
were included for analysis. Patient characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. The number of patients with
cirrhosis was lower in the Angers cohort than in the
Bordeaux cohort (6% versus 24%, respectively; P <
0.0001). Otherwise, both groups had similar rates of
obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic
syndrome. With the exception of the SSI median stiff-
ness value for diagnoses of F3 or greater disease, there
were no significant differences between both centers in
median levels of LSM using SSI, FibroScan, or ARFI,
adjusted for fibrosis stage, or for the correlation
between LSM and fibrosis stage (Supporting Table 1),
allowing results from both centers to be pooled
together.
FAILURES OF MEASUREMENTS
OR UNRELIABLE RESULTS
LSM failures occurred in 13% of cases (38 of
291) with SSI, 14.4% (42 of 291) with FibroScan
and 0.7% with ARFI (2 of 291) (Table 2 and
Figure 1). Unreliable results were observed in 7.2%
CASSINOTTO ET AL.
HEPATOLOGY, June 2016
1820
 of cases with SSI (21 of 291 patients), 8.9% of cases
with FibroScan (26 of 291), and 18.2% of cases with
ARFI (53 of 291 patients). Failure rates were lower
for ARFI than for SSI or FibroScan (both P <
0.0001), whereas unreliable results were higher for
ARFI than for SSI or FibroScan (P 5 0.0001 and P
5 0.001, respectively). Very reliable results (as
defined for FibroScan [i.e., IQR/LSM < 0.10])
were more frequent with SSI than for FibroScan or
ARFI (both P < 0.0001). Overall, there were no
differences in the reliability of results, with 79.7%
reliable results produced by SSI (232 of 291), 76.6%
by FibroScan (223 of 291), and 81% by ARFI (236
of 291) (P 5 0.4 for SSI versus FibroScan, P 5 0.7
for SSI versus ARFI, and P 5 0.2 for FibroScan
versus ARFI).
FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH
LSM FAILURES OR UNRELIABLE
RESULTS
Using logistic regression, we determined that the
variables associated with failure of measurement or
unreliable results with at least two of the three techni-
ques studied included: waist circumference (R2 5 0.19
for SSI, 0.16 for FibroScan, and 0.18 for ARFI), BMI
(R2 5 0.10 for SSI, 0.08 for FibroScan, and 0.16 for
ARFI), intercostal wall thickness (R2 5 0.08 for SSI,
0.05 for FibroScan, and 0.08 for ARFI), diabetes (R2
5 0.04 for SSI and 0.05 for FibroScan and ARFI),
presence of metabolic syndrome (R2 5 0.07 for Fibro-
Scan and 0.10 for ARFI), and ALT (R2 5 0.03 for
FibroScan and 0.02 for ARFI). For each of the three

were lower in patients with a waist circumference

phy techniques regarding the proportions of reliable
results among patients with a waist circumference
�102 cm or BMI � 30 kg/m2.
CONFOUNDING FACTORS OF
LIVER STIFFNESS IN NAFLD
PATIENTS
By univariate analysis, among many factors associated
with liver stiffness, those associated with all 3 techniques
were: fibrosis stage (Spearman’s correlation coefficient
from 0.55 to 0.68), aspartate aminotransferase (0.18 to
0.34), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (0.17 to 0.30),
albumin (20.22 to 20.31), age (0.16 to 0.25), platelet
count (20.20 to 20.29), diabetes (0.23 to 0.29), meta-
bolic score (0.23 to 0.28), waist circumference (0.18 to
0.26), hypertension (0.18 to 0.26), alkaline phosphatase
(0.13 to 0.26), prothrombin time (20.12 to 20.25),
and cholesterol (20.14 to 20.28) (Supporting Table 2).
In stepwise multiple regression, four independent varia-
bles were found to be associated with LSM results
when using any of the three techniques: fibrosis stage,

 alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and waist circumference.
It is notable that the presence of inflammation and
hepatocyte ballooning (assessed via the NAS score), and
steatosis were slightly correlated in the univariate analy-
sis with FibroScan results (Spearman’s correlation coef-
ficient of 0.28 and 0.22, respectively), but not with SSI
or ARFI results. However, neither NAS nor steatosis
affected the LSM results of FibroScan in the multivari-
ate analysis.
DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCES
OF ELASTOGRAPHY
TECHNIQUES
The median values of LSM for each stage of fibrosis
are presented in Table 3. SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI
results demonstrated a strong correlation with histo-
logical fibrosis stage (Supporting Fig. 1). However, the
correlation between SSI results and fibrosis stage was
significantly superior to the correlation between ARFI
results and fibrosis stage (r2 5 0.72 versus 0.59,
P 5 0.0003; respectively), whereas the difference
between SSI and FibroScan correlation coefficients
was not significant (r2 5 0.72 versus 0.67; P 5 0.1) as
well as the difference between FibroScan and ARFI
correlation coefficients (r2 5 0.67 versus 0.59; P 5
0.08). Measurements by SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI
correlated well with each other (r2 5 0.70 for SSI and
FibroScan, 0.70 for SSI and ARFI, and 0.56 for M
and ARFI). Diagnostic performance according to the
AUROC values for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis,
severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis was good for SSI, which
ranged from 0.86 to 0.89; good for FibroScan, which
ranged from 0.82 to 0.87; and fair or good for ARFI,
which ranged from 0.77 to 0.84 (Table 4). The
AUROC values for diagnosing severe fibrosis or cir-
rhosis were particularly good, between 0.86 and 0.89,
for SSI or FibroScan.

 PAIRWISE COMPARISON OF
DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCES
Pairwise comparisons of AUROC values between
SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI (Fig. 2) were performed on
231 patients (60 patients were excluded from the anal-
ysis due to failure of measurement either with SSI,
FibroScan, or ARFI). For the diagnosis of significant
fibrosis (�F2), SSI had a significantly better diagnostic
performance than ARFI (AUROC of 0.85, 0.83, and
0.76 for SSI, FibroScan and ARFI, respectively; P 5
0.5 for SSI versus FibroScan; P 5 0.004 for SSI versus
ARFI; and P 5 0.07 for FibroScan versus ARFI). For
the diagnosis of severe fibrosis (�F3), no significant
differences were observed between SSI, FibroScan,
and ARFI (AUROC of 0.87, 0.86, and 0.84, respec-
tively; P 5 0.5 for SSI versus FibroScan; P 5 0.2 for
SSI versus ARFI; and P 5 0.5 for FibroScan versus

 ARFI). Similarly, no significant differences were
observed for the diagnosis of cirrhosis (F4) between
SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI (AUROC of 0.88, 0.86,
and 0.84, respectively; P 5 0.5 for SSI versus Fibro-
Scan; P 5 0.07 for SSI versus ARFI; and P 5 0.5 for

OPTIMAL LIVER STIFFNESS
CUTOFF VALUES
The optimal LSM cutoff values, according to a sen-
sitivity of at least 90% and a specificity of at least 90%
for the diagnosis of F2 or greater, F3 or greater, and
F4 diseases, are described in Table 4. It is notable that
the cutoff values for SSI and FibroScan for ruling out
diseases with at least 90% sensitivity were very close:
6.3 kPa and 6.2 kPa for the diagnosis of F2 or greater,
8.3 kPa and 8.2 kPa for the diagnosis of severe fibrosis,
and 10.5 kPa and 9.5 kPa for the diagnosis of cirrhosis,
respectively (Fig. 3). The LSM cutoff values for SSI
and FibroScan, according to the Youden index and the
best diagnostic accuracy, were also very close (Support-
ing Table 3). However, SSI generated lower stiffness
values than FibroScan for ruling in diseases with a
specificity of at least 90%: 8.7 kPa and 9.8 kPa for the
diagnosis of F2 or greater, 10.7 kPa and 12.5 kPa for
the diagnosis of severe fibrosis, and 14.4 kPa and 16.1
kPa for the diagnosis of cirrhosis, respectively.
Discussion
In this prospective cohort of NAFLD patients who
received liver biopsies, SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI per-
formed well with regard to diagnosing different stages
of liver fibrosis. These techniques achieved good diag-
nostic performance, especially SSI with AUROC val-
ues ranging from 0.86 to 0.89 and FibroScan with
AUROC values from 0.82 to 0.87, whereas ARFI
AUROC values ranged from 0.77 to 0.84. The diag-
nostic accuracy of SSI was greater than that of ARFI
in the diagnosis of significant fibrosis or greater disease
(AUROC of 0.85 versus 0.76; P 5 0.004). Another
important finding of our study is that several cutoff
values for SSI and FibroScan were very close, which
can be of great use in routine daily practice.
Although several validation studies have previously
confirmed the accuracy of testing LSM using Fibro-
Scan or ARFI in NAFLD, our study is the first to
assess the accuracy of SSI and to compare these three
techniques in this field. The diagnostic performance of
the M probe for FibroScan in our patient population
was consistent with previous prospective studies.(24,25)
Conversely, our results concerning ARFI accuracy
were less striking than those in previous studies. In a
preliminary study by Yoneda et al.,(26) analysis was per-
formed on 54 NAFLD patients, including few patients
with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3, n 5 4; and F4, n
5 6). Palmeri et al.(27) found that the best accuracy for
ARFI in NAFLD patients occurred when distinguish-
ing between patients with no or moderate fibrosis (F0
to F2) and those with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3-
F4). Unfortunately, in our study, the improved accu-
racy of ARFI for diagnosing F2 or greater disease was
not confirmed.
Indeed, the major challenge when measuring LSM
in NAFLD patients is the lower success rate in obese
patients. Consistent with previous results,(28,29) obesity
was, in our study, the main feature associated with a
significant increase in the failure rate when using
FibroScan. We showed that failed, unreliable, and reli-
able LSM rates when using SSI were very close to
those of FibroScan, with a great impact of obesity on
LSM failure rates. Reliable results when using SSI
were obtained in approximately 90% of patients with a
BMI < 30 kg/m2 (�85% for FibroScan) but only in
nearly 73% of patients with a BMI � 30 kg/m2 (71%
for FibroScan). The interference by obesity on the
ARFI technique was less conspicuous, with a failure
rate that was not significantly increased in obese
patients. However, the impact of obesity on ARFI
diagnostic accuracy and reliability should not be under-
appreciated, as a much higher number of patients had
unreliable LSM in obese patients.
In a multivariate analysis, LSM was mainly associ-
ated with fibrotic stage. Multivariate analysis also
revealed that steatosis, inflammation, or hepatocyte
ballooning (indirectly assessed via the NAS score) did
not have a significant effect on LSM results. This
result can be considered as positive because the impact

 of different confounding factors is frequently a limita-
tion for most diagnostic techniques. However, the lack
of a link between these factors and LSM can also be
considered to be negative when diagnosing NAFLD
patients, because some NASH patients may have no
fibrosis but do present with liver injury lesions with
inflammation or hepatocyte ballooning. Therefore,
LSM may not aid in the diagnosis of early stage
NASH without fibrosis. Moreover, it is interesting to
note that in univariate analysis, FibroScan results had a
slight correlation with steatosis and NAFLD activity
score (R 5 0.22 and 0.28), whereas SSI and ARFI did
not (with close correlation coefficients: R 5 0.10 and
0.07 for NAS, and R 5 0.03 and 0.0002 for steatosis,
respectively). We can suppose that these differences
are due to technical differences between the technique
of FibroScan and those of SSI and ARFI, as the veloc-
ity of the mechanical wave generated by the probe of
FibroScan is recorded on about 4 cm into the liver,
whereas the shear wave propagation issued from the
focused ultrasonic beams of ARFI and SSI are
recorded at a very low amplitude.
Our study has several limitations. First, liver biopsy
was used as the reference standard to assess and quan-
tify liver fibrosis. The diagnostic efficiency of biopsy is
normally limited by the variability in the representa-
tiveness of the samples and by inter- and intraobserver
variability. To reduce these limitations, we excluded all
patients with biopsies that did not meet specific quality
criteria. Moreover, the main results of our study were
sustained when biopsies between 10 and 15 mm were
excluded (data not shown). A second limitation of our
study is the lack of use of the XL probe used for Fibro-
Scan. The XL probe, which is used for overweight
patients, has been shown to increase the rate of reliable
results significantly, especially in obese patients, with
an accuracy similar to that of the M probe.(30) It would
have been interesting to analyze the added value of the
XL probe when SSI and the M probe were also avail-
able; unfortunately, the XL probe was not available at
the time of LSM for a part of our study population.
Third, our study focused on LSM techniques and did
not analyze the impact or clinical value of the biological
fibrosis tests that are usually performed in the field of
NAFLD. Further studies are needed to assess the ways
in which LSM and biological tests could be used
together to provide the best diagnostic performance for
NAFLD patients.
In conclusion, this prospective study confirmed that
SSI, FibroScan, and ARFI are valuable diagnostic
tools for the staging of liver fibrosis in NAFLD
patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy of SSI was
superior to that of ARFI for the diagnosis of F2 or
greater disease states. Most of the cutoff values for SSI
for the diagnosis of different stages of liver disease
were quite close to those for FibroScan, which could
be of great importance for the applicability of this tech-
nique and its wide dissemination among radiologists
and hepatologists in their daily practice. However, as
for the M probe of FibroScan, the SSI technique
remains limited by a significant increase in its failure
rate in cases of obesity, whereas ARFI presents with a
great increase of unreliable results.
