Abstract
Background: Although recent short-term cross-sectional studies have revealed that chronic periodontitis (CP) may
be a risk factor for increased cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), systematic reviews and
long-term longitudinal studies have provided less clear evidence regarding the relationship between CP and AD.
Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance Research Database
(NHIRD) of Taiwan to determine whether patients with CP are at increased risk of developing AD.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective matched-cohort study using the NHIRD of Taiwan. We identified 9291 patients
newly diagnosed with CP between 1997 and 2004. A total of 18,672 patients without CP were matched to the patient
cohort according to sex, age, index year, co-morbidity and urbanisation level. Cox proportional hazards regression
analyses were performed to evaluate the subsequent risk of AD.
Results: Patients with CP had a higher prevalence of hyperlipidaemia, depression, traumatic brain injury and
co-morbidities, as well as higher urbanisation levels, than those in the unexposed cohort (all p < 0.01). At the
final follow-up, totals of 115 (1.24%) and 208 (1.11%) individuals in the CP exposed and unexposed groups,
respectively, had developed AD. Patients with 10 years of CP exposure exhibited a higher risk of developing
AD than unexposed groups (adjusted HR 1.707, 95% CI 1.152–2.528, p = 0.0077).
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that 10-year CP exposure was associated with a 1.707-fold increase in
the risk of developing AD. These findings highlight the need to prevent progression of periodontal disease
and promote healthcare service at the national level.

Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease
characterised by progressive cognitive decline and mem-
ory loss, inevitably leading to complete loss of mental
faculties and death [1]. AD is the most common cause
of dementia in older adults [2–5]. Furthermore, due to
increasing life expectancy and lifestyle changes, recent
projections have indicated that 1 in 85 individuals will
be diagnosed with AD by 2050 [6].
Recent evidence indicates that peripheral infections,
blood vessel damage and oxidative stress may aggravate
inflammation in the brain and play an important role in
the pathogenesis of dementia and AD [7, 8]. Indeed, pre-
vious reports have revealed that diabetes mellitus [9],
hypertension [10], hyperlipidaemia [11], chronic kidney
disease [12], depression [13], stroke [14], traumatic brain
injury [15] and periodontal problems [16, 17] are associ-
ated with cognitive impairment. Chronic periodontitis
(CP) is a peripheral infectious/inflammatory condition
that is among the leading risk factors for tooth loss [18].

 CP has been associated with increases in serum levels of
C-reactive protein (CRP) [19] and pro-inflammatory
cytokines (e.g., tumour necrosis factor-α), as well as de-
creases in anti-inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-10)
[20]. Studies have further revealed that CP is linked to
numerous inflammatory diseases, including cardiovascular
disease [21] and diabetes mellitus [22], as well as to other
neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease
[23]. Researchers have speculated that this association is
due to the increases in systemic inflammation that accom-
pany the growth of periodontal pathogenic microorgan-
isms. In other mechanism by which CP contributes to AD,
systemic inflammation caused by periodontal pathogens
may also play a role in vascular disease and endothelial
dysfunction. With accumulating studies supporting vascu-
lar factors in the development of AD, vascular factors
could be a mediator in the development of AD [24–26].
Although recent short-term cross-sectional studies have
revealed that CP may be a risk factor for increased cogni-
tive impairment in patients with AD [5, 27], systematic
reviews and long-term longitudinal studies have provided
less clear evidence regarding the relationship between CP
and AD [1, 26, 28]. Therefore, we conducted a retrospect-
ive cohort study using the National Health Insurance
Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to determine
whether patients with CP are at increased risk of develop-
ing AD.
Methods
Data sources
Developed in 1995, the National Health Insurance Pro-
gram provides universal and comprehensive healthcare
for approximately 99% of residents in Taiwan [29]. In
the present study, we used 1996–2013 data from the
NHIRD in Taiwan. One million individuals included in
the NHIRD were selected at random, representing about
4.5% of all enrolees [30]. There was no significant differ-
ence in age or sex between participants included in the
study sample and all NHIRD enrolees. We extracted
data regarding demographic characteristics, including
encrypted identification numbers, sex, dates of birth and
death, and diagnostic information. The diagnostic data
included the dates of dental procedures, as well as Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clin-
ical Modification (ICD-9-CM), diagnostic and procedure
codes [31]. Approval for the present study was obtained
from the institutional review board (IRB) of Chung Shan
Medical University (CS2-15071). The requirement for
informed consent was waived by the IRB because all
NHIRD data had been de-identified.
Study design and sampled participants
The present retrospective, matched-cohort study included
patients aged ≥50 years who had been newly diagnosed
with CP (between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2004)
on the basis of ICD-9-CM diagnostic criteria: code 523.4
(CP) [32]. In addition, each enrolled patient had been
diagnosed with CP following at least two outpatient clinic
visits during the 1-year study period [33]. Exclusion
criteria were as follows: (1) unknown age and/or sex, (2)
diagnosis of CP prior to 1997 and (3) diagnosis of AD
(ICD-9-CM code 331.0) prior to 1997 or prior to the first
visit for CP [33]. To ensure the accuracy of our findings,
we also excluded patients with unknown vital status and
those who had not used health services in the past 12
months, because the NHIRD does not include death re-
cords. The sample included a total of 9291 patients with
CP and 18,672 patients without CP matched according to
sex, age and index years (1:2 ratio).
Both cohorts were followed from the index date until
the diagnosis of AD, death or 31 December 2013 (Fig. 1).
The covariates included sex and age group (50–59,
60–69 and ≥70 years). According to the definition of
urbanisation issued by the National Institutes of Health in
Taiwan, all 365 townships in Taiwan are divided into 7
clusters according to the following variables: population
density (people per square kilometre), proportion of the
population with a college-level education or higher, pro-
portion of individuals over 65 years old, number of agri-
cultural workers, and number of physicians per 100,000
people. In the present study, townships of one or two clus-
ters, three or four clusters, and five to seven clusters were
categorised as levels 1, 2 and 3, respectively [34].
We also analysed AD-related co-morbidities, including
hypertension (ICD-9-CM codes 401.1, 401.9, 402.10,
402.90, 404.10, 404.90, 405.1 and 405.9) [10], hyperlipid-
aemia (ICD-9-CM codes 272.0–272.9) [11], chronic kid-
ney disease (ICD-9-CM codes 580, 581–589, 753, 403,
404, 250.4, 274.1, 440.1, 442.1, 447.3, 572.4, 642.1 and
646.2) [12], depression (ICD-9-CM code 311) [13], stroke
(ICD-9-CM codes 433, 434 and 436) [14], diabetes melli-
tus (ICD-9-CM codes 250–250.3, 250.7) [22] and trau-
matic brain injury (ICD-9-CM codes 800–804, 850–854,
905.0, 950.1, 950.3, 907.0, 959.01, 959.9, 310.2 and V15.52)
[15]. The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), which con-
tains 17 weighted co-morbidities, was also calculated for
each participant [35].
Statistical analysis
We used t tests and chi-square tests to compare the
demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with
CP with those of patients without CP. Univariate and
multivariate stratified Cox regression models were then
used to calculate HRs and 95% CIs. Multivariable
models were adjusted for AD-related co-morbidities,
CCI score, and urbanisation level. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to assess the AD survival probability be-
tween the exposed and unexposed cohorts. The log-rank

 test was used to compare differences between these two
cohorts.
Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify patients
diagnosed with CP ≥1 year following the diagnosis of
AD, as well as the incidence of AD occurring ≥10 years
following the diagnosis of CP [4]. To ensure the stability
and accuracy of the statistical model, we excluded from
the sensitivity analysis patients diagnosed with AD <1
and <10 years after the diagnosis of CP [36]. We used a
mediation model to identify and explain the other path-
ways or processes underlying an observed relationship
between CP (independent variable) and AD (dependent
variable) via the hypothetical mediator of cerebrovascular
disease (ICD-9 codes 430–438) [26]. All statistical analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA) and IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA) software. The level of statistical
significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
The baseline characteristics of the study sample are pre-
sented in Table 1. Patients with CP had a higher preva-
lence of hyperlipidaemia, depression and traumatic brain
injury, as well as a CCI score and urbanisation level,
than the unexposed cohort (all p < 0.01). The mean ages
and follow-up times for the exposed and unexposed co-
horts were 54.1 ± 10.5 vs. 54.2 ± 10.5 years and 11.9 ± 2.6
vs.12.2 ± 2.6 years, respectively.
Totals of 115 (1.24%) and 208 (1.11%) patients were di-
agnosed with AD in the exposed and unexposed cohorts,
respectively (Fig. 1). Table 2 shows the Cox regression
analysis of risk factors associated with the development of
AD. Although patients with CP exhibited higher crude
HRs (1.301, 95% CI 1.012–1.673, p = 0.0404) for the devel-
opment of AD than those without CP, the adjusted HR
was 1.297, indicating a lack of statistical significance
(95% CI 0.995–1.692, p = 0.0547) (Table 2). Patients
with depression, stroke and traumatic brain injury
tended to have a higher risk for the development of
AD (all p < 0.05). Moreover, the risk of AD was lower
in patients with urbanisation level 2 and level 3 (both
p < 0.05). Figure 2 depicts the Kaplan-Meier curve for
the cumulative risk of AD in the exposed and unex-
posed groups. A significant difference was observed
between the two groups once 10 years of CP expos-
ure had been reached (p = 0.0264 by log-rank test).
The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in
Table 2. We performed sensitivity analysis after excluding
patients diagnosed with AD <1 year and <10 years after
the diagnosis of CP. The association between CP and AD
was significant after 10 years of CP exposure (adjusted HR
1.707, p = 0.0077). In statistics, a mediation model explains
and underlies an observed relationship between an inde-
pendent variable (IV) and dependent variable (DV) via the
inclusion of a mediator (M). They have significance of a
mediation model (IV → M, p < 0.001, 95% CI 3.292–3.763;
M → DV, p = 0.0118, 95% CI 1.121–2.506; and IV → D,
p = 0.0077, 95% CI 1.152–2.528). This result shows
that cerebrovascular disease is a partial mediator be-
tween CP and AD. CP can also cause AD directly.

 Discussion
The present study is the first nationwide population-based
matched-cohort study to demonstrate that patients with
10-year CP exposure exhibit an increased risk of develop-
ing AD (adjusted HR 1.707), regardless of co-morbidities,
CCI score or urbanisation level. The prevalence of AD
significantly increases with age, although AD in general is
more common in women than in men [3]. AD is charac-
terised by salient inflammatory features, microglial activa-
tion and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
which contribute to the inflammatory status of the central
nervous system [37]. As a low-grade systemic disease, CP
may involve the slow release of pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines and CRP into the systemic circulation. This low-
grade inflammation is thought to impact general systemic
health and exacerbate other systemic disorders [38].
Therefore, CP may be a significant source of covert
peripheral inflammation within the general popula-
tion. Periodontitis has a tendency to infiltrate the systemic
circulation with inflammatory mediators, thereby resulting
in systemic disease. Researchers have proposed that peri-
odontitis can lead to progression of AD by further increas-
ing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and can lead to
the invasion of micro-organisms from the dental plaque
biofilm
into
the
brain
[28].
Moreover,
these
pro-
inflammatory cytokines may penetrate the blood-brain
barrier and induce neurodegenerative changes that ultim-
ately influence the development of AD [26]. In the present
study, we observed a significant correlation between CP
and AD only after the 10-year follow-up for the initial
diagnosis of CP. This finding supports the notion that
pro-inflammatory factors due to CP may slowly and pro-
gressively induce neurodegenerative changes that lead to
the development of AD. However, further study is re-
quired to verify this hypothesis.
In previous small and/or short-term cross-sectional
studies, the authors examined only the associations be-
tween periodontal inflammation and AD [5, 27], without
investigating the potential cause-and-effect relationship
between the two. However, in a previous study, re-
searchers reported that periodontitis is associated with an
increased risk of developing dementia [33]. Moreover, a
10-year clinical observational study conducted by Tzeng
et al. revealed that patients with at least 8 years of peri-
odontal problems exhibited a significantly higher risk of
developing dementia and neurodegenerative diseases than
healthy unexposed groups [4]. Despite these crucial find-
ings, neither of the aforementioned studies identified the
role of periodontitis in AD development. The present
population-based study is the first to demonstrate a sig-
nificantly increased risk of AD after 10-year CP exposure.
Our findings support the notion that infectious diseases
associated with low-grade inflammation, such as CP, may
play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of AD [39]. In

 mediation analysis, the role of cerebrovascular disease is
as a partial mediator, and CP can also cause AD directly.
Systemic inflammation caused by periodontal pathogens,
such
as
Porphyromonas
gingivalis
and
Streptococcus
sanguinis, may be a factor in endothelial dysfunction and
vascular disease [26]. The mediator model facilitates a bet-
ter understanding of the relationship between CP and AD.
However, it needs more relevant and further investigation
to confirm and clarify the pathway.
Co-morbidities including depression, stroke and trau-
matic brain injury were directly associated with the risk of
developing AD in the present study, in accordance with
the findings of previous studies. Burke et al. reported that
depression was associated with AD in a group of partici-
pants who were initially cognitively asymptomatic [13],
whereas additional studies have revealed a significant
association between stroke/brain damage and dementia
[14, 15]. Our findings also indicate that urbanisation level
1 was a significant risk factor for AD. This finding may be
explained by differences between urban and rural life-
styles, availability of medical resources and convenience of
medical access [3, 40]. Patients with AD also exhibit
impairments in chewing function due to progressive
neurodegeneration, increasing the risk of periodontal
problems [41, 42]. Hence, proper dental care and oral
rehabilitation are necessary to improve masticatory
function in this patient population.
The present study possesses several advantages over
previous work. Firstly, we used a nationwide database,
which allowed us to examine a large sample of patients
over a 16-year follow-up period. Secondly, because the
Taiwanese NHIRD provides continued coverage for the
whole population of Taiwan and randomises recruits, in
the present study, we were able to minimise the influ-
ence of bias associated with data collection, region and
institution. Thirdly, the use of the NHIRD eliminated
the need to minimise patients in the cohort who were
lost to follow-up and enabled us to obtain large, geograph-
ically dispersed samples of patients with varying socio-
demographic characteristics [34]. Lastly, we defined AD
using strict criteria (ICD-9-CM code 331.0) to ensure the
accuracy of our statistical analysis.
However, the present study also possesses some limita-
tions of note. Firstly, we could not clarify the medical
records of all missing recruited CP and AD subjects,
because all the medical records from the NHIRD were
de-identified due to ethical considerations. It is possible
that the incidence of CP or AD was underestimated in
our study because patients who had not received medical
records during the study period were excluded. Although
this would result in fewer patients with less severe forms
of CP or AD in our sample, the exposed-unexposed

 matched design would also diminish this bias. Secondly,
the nationwide database used in the present study did not
allow us to obtain data regarding the severity of AD. Fur-
thermore, AD and dementia may overlap in this study
because we were not able to clarify the medical records of
all defined AD, owing to all the medical records from the
NHIRD being de-identified due to ethical considerations.
Thirdly, the broad age categories are important variable
indexes. However, because of this limitation, there may be
residual confounding by age [4]. Finally, in detailed dem-
ography concerning smoking habits, the NHIRD did not
provide personal information regarding certain and defin-
ite variables relevant to our research [43]. Moreover,
although education is an important variable index of AD,
the education level of individuals in the NHIRD is not
available. Further research is needed to explain the com-
plex relationship between urbanisation and education.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate that 10-year CP exposure was
associated with a 1.707-fold increase in the risk of devel-
oping AD. These findings highlight the need to prevent
progression of periodontal disease and promote health-
care services at the national level.
