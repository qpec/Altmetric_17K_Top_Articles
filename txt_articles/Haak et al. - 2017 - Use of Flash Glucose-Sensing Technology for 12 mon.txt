ABSTRACT
Introduction: Published evaluations of sensor
glucose monitoring use in insulin treated type 2
diabetes are limited. The aim of this study was
to assess the impact of flash glucose-sensing
technology as a replacement for self-monitoring
of blood glucose (SMBG) over a 12-month per-
iod in participants with type 2 diabetes who
were on intensive insulin therapy.
Methods: An
open-label,
randomized,
con-
trolled study in adults with type 2 diabetes on
intensive insulin therapy from 26 European
diabetes centers aimed at assessing flash glucose
sensing technology was conducted. Participants
(N = 224) were randomized (1:2 respectively) to
a control group (n = 75) that used SMBG (Free-
Style
LiteTM)
or
to
an
intervention
group
(n = 149)
which
used
sensor
glucose
data
(FreeStyle LibreTM Flash Glucose Monitoring
System) for self-management over 6 months. All
intervention group participants who completed
the 6-month treatment phase continued into an
additional 6-month open-access phase.
Results: A total of 139 intervention partici-
pants completed the 6-month treatment phase
and continued into the open-access phase. At
12 months (end of open-access period), time in
hypoglycemia
[sensor
glucose \
3.9 mmol/L
(70 mg/dL)] was reduced by 50% compared to
baseline [-0.70 ± 1.85/24 h (mean ± standard
deviation);
p = 0.0002].

 (70 mg/dL)] was reduced by 52%; p = 0.0002.
There was no change in time in range [sensor
glucose
3.9–10.0 mmol/L
(70–180 mg/dL)].
SMBG testing fell from a mean of 3.9 (median
3.9) times/day at baseline to 0.2 (0.0), with an
average frequency of sensor scanning of 7.1
(5.7) times/day at 12 months, and mean sensor
utilization was 83.6 ± 13.8% (median 88.3%)
during the open-access phase. During this 6-
month extension period no device-related seri-
ous adverse events were reported. Nine partici-
pants reported 16 instances of device-related
adverse events (e.g. infection, allergy) and 28
participants (20.1%) experienced 134 occur-
rences of anticipated skin symptoms/sensor-in-
sertion events expected with device use (e.g.
erythema, itching and rash).
Conclusion: The use of flash glucose-sensing
technology for glycemic management in indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes treated by intensive
insulin therapy over 12 months was associated
with a sustained reduction in hypoglycemia and
safely and effectively replaced SMBG.

INTRODUCTION
The management of hyperglycemia remains a
primary
focus
of
diabetes
management
in
patients with type 2 diabetes. Current manage-
ment strategies balance optimization of glucose
control with potential risks from the therapy,
especially hypoglycemia [1]. In both type 1 and
type 2 diabetes, increased hypoglycemic risk is
associated with the duration of diabetes and
insulin use [2, 3] and not with glycated hemo-
globin (HbA1c) level [3]. Prandial insulin carries
a higher risk for non-severe hypoglycemia than
treatment with basal insulin alone [4], and
intensive insulin treatment for the manage-
ment of type 2 diabetes further increases the risk
for
severe
hypoglycemia
[5].
Therefore,
enhanced detection of dysglycemia for patients
with type 2 diabetes managed with multiple
daily injections or continuous subcutaneous
insulin infusion (CSII) is essential and can be
challenging with self-monitoring of blood glu-
cose
(SMBG)
as
neither
hypo-
nor
hyper-
glycemia are easily detected [6]. Continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM) can offer enhanced
assessment of glycemic issues; however, current
guidance for CGM use and benefit in the patient
population with type 2 diabetes excludes the
use of intensive insulin therapy [7] due to the
scarcity of published data in this population [8].
Our results from the randomized controlled
trial ‘‘Novel Glucose-sensing Technology as a
Replacement for Blood Glucose Monitoring for
the Management of Insulin-treated Type 2
Diabetes
(REPLACE)’’,
which
compared
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
the
new
flash
glu-
cose-sensing technology to SMBG over a 6-
month period have been published [9]. This
study
included
an
additional
6-month
open-access phase for all participants in the
intervention group. The aim of the open-access
phase was twofold: to evaluate (1) the safety of
the new device in day-to-day use over an
extended time period by assessing changes in
glycemic
measures
between
baseline
and
12 months
and
(2)
device-related
adverse
events.
The flash glucose-sensing technology used
was FreeStyle LibreTM, a sensor-based flash glu-
cose monitoring system (Abbott Diabetes Care,
Witney,
UK).
This
small,
single-use,
fac-
tory-calibrated, on-body sensor utilizes wired
enzyme
technology
(osmium
mediator
and
glucose oxidase enzyme co-immobilized on
electrochemical sensor) to continuously moni-
tor interstitial glucose levels. The sensor is worn
on the back of the arm for up to 14 days and
automatically stores glucose data every 15 min.
A real-time glucose level may be obtained as
often as each minute by scanning the sensor
with the reader. A glucose trend arrow (indi-
cating rate and direction of change in glucose
levels) and a graphical trace of glucose values for
the previous 8-h period is also displayed on the
screen. Data are transferred wirelessly by radio
frequency identification from the sensor to the
reader memory which stores historical sensor
data for 90 days. Data can be uploaded using the
device software to generate summary glucose
reports
(including
an
ambulatory
glucose
574
Diabetes Ther (2017) 8:573–586
 profile) for review by the patient at home or in
the clinic with their healthcare professional
[10].
METHODS
Details on the rationale, methodology and
results of the treatment phase (6 months) of the
REPLACE study have been described previously
[9]. Briefly, this was a 6-month, prospective,
open-label, non-masked, two-arm, randomized
controlled study that was conducted at 26
European diabetes centers (8 in France, 10 in
Germany, 8 in the UK). The treatment phase of
the study was designed to compare the use of
novel flash glucose sensing technology with
SMBG in participants with type 2 diabetes
treated with multi-dose insulin therapy. Fol-
lowing completion of the 6-month treatment
phase, intervention group participants contin-
ued using flash sensing technology for a further
6 months during the open-access period.
At each study center, any potentially eligible
patient from the general diabetes population
was invited to participate in the study if they
were C18 years of age with type 2 diabetes
treated with insulin for at least 6 months and
on their current regimen (prandial only or
prandial and basal multi-dose-insulin therapy
or CSII therapy) for C3 months; had an HbA1c
level of 58–108 mmol/mol (7.5–12.0%); had
self-reported regular blood glucose testing data
(more than 10/week for at least 2 months prior
to study entry); were considered by the inves-
tigator to be technically capable of using the
flash sensor-based glucose monitoring system.
Participants were not included for the fol-
lowing reasons: if they had any other insulin
regimen to that described above; had a total daily
dose of insulin C1.75 U/kg on study entry; had
severe
hypoglycemia
(requiring
third-party
assistance) [8], diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperos-
molar–hyperglycemic state in the preceding
6 months; had a known allergy to medical-grade
adhesives; used continuous glucose monitoring
within the previous 4 months; were pregnant or
planning
pregnancy;
were
receiving
steroid
therapy for any condition; were considered by
the investigator to be unsuitable to participate.
Approval
was
given
by
the
appropriate
competent authorities in each country. All
procedures were in accordance with the ethical
standards of the responsible committee on
human
experimentation
(institutional
and
national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of
1964, as revised in 2013. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients for participation in
the study.
Following 2 weeks of blinded sensor wear,
the subjects were randomized (centrally, using
biased-coin minimization dependent on study
center and insulin administration) to the con-
trol group (SMBG) or to the intervention group
(glucose-sensing technology). For the 6-month
treatment
phase
(post-randomization),
the
sensor-based glucose monitoring system was
un-blinded for the participants in the inter-
vention group so that they could continuously
use sensor glucose data for self-management,
including insulin dose decisions, in accordance
with the product labeling. No training was
provided to these participants for interpretation
of glucose sensor data. Their historical data was
uploaded at subsequent study visits, and glu-
cose
reports
[including
ambulatory
profile
reports (AGP)] were generated for review by the
healthcare professional with the participant,
using the device software [10].
At 6 months (day 208), all control partici-
pants concluded their involvement in the study
while
intervention
participants
entered
an
open-label, open-access study phase for a fur-
ther 6 months. For the open-access phase par-
ticipants continued to use the sensor-based
glucose monitoring system for their day-to-day
glucose management and also to record any
events in their event diary. These participants
had a review of their glucose reports with the
clinician at 3-month intervals; at the beginning
of the open-access phase and after a further
3 months (day 284). Similar to the visits during
the intervention phase, at these visits the effect
of life-style/diet on glucose levels and insulin
doses were discussed and any management
changes agreed upon. In order to continue to
reflect ‘‘real world’’ conditions there was no
pre-set algorithm for insulin adjustments man-
dated
by
the
protocol.
However,
common
principles continued to be applied, including
Diabetes Ther (2017) 8:573–586
575
 avoidance of hypoglycemia, optimization of
fasting glucose and reduction of postprandial
glucose excursions.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were changes in sen-
sor-derived glycemic measures between baseline
and
12 months
post-baseline.
The
sen-
sor-derived glycemic measures were number
and duration of hypoglycemic events [glucose
\
3.9 mmol/L
(70 mg/dL)]
and
number
and
duration of hyperglycemic events [glucose
[
13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dL)].
Pre-specified secondary endpoints included
sensor-derived
glycemic
measures
between
baseline and 12 months post-baseline; frequency
of glucose finger-sticks and sensor scans per day
during the study period; and total daily dose of
insulin.
Sensor-derived
glycemic
measures
included number and duration of hypoglycemic
events [glucose \
3.1 mmol/L (55 mg/dL)]; time
in glucose range 3.9–10.0 mmol/L (70–180 mg/
dL), number and duration of hyperglycemic
events
[glucose [
10.0 mmol/L
(180 mg/dL)];
mean and standard deviation (SD) glucose. An
event was defined as at least two consecutive
readings, at 15-min intervals, outside the prede-
fined glucose range (the end of an episode was 1
reading at or inside the predefined range).
Safety endpoints incorporated all adverse
events, including severe hypoglycemia (requir-
ing third-party assistance [2]), hypoglycemic
events and sensor insertion or sensor wear-re-
lated
symptoms,
diabetic
ketoacidosis
or
hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state episodes and
cardiac events.
Statistical Analysis
Differences between post-baseline and baseline
measurements were evaluated using a paired
t test. Sensor-derived glycemic endpoint values
were excluded from the analysis if \
72 h of
sensor results were available from the final
14-day sensor wear (days 374–388). Confidence
intervals were calculated for the mean differ-
ence from baseline.
The results presented here are for the full
analysis set. Data analysis was performed by a
contract
research
organization
(ICON
PLC;
Dublin, Ireland, managed by Abbott Diabetes
Care) and by Abbott Diabetes Care. We used SAS
version 9.2 or higher for all analyses (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
number NCT02082184.
RESULTS
All 139 (100%) intervention participants com-
pleting the treatment phase continued into the
open-access phase, of whom 125 completed the
open-access phase (Fig. 1). The primary reason
for discontinuation was skin reaction at the
sensor site. Participants’ baseline characteristics
are summarized in Table 1. Sensor-derived gly-
cemic endpoint values were included for 108
participants who had C72 h of sensor results

Safety
The flash sensor-based system was used for an
overall duration of 12 months by participants.
During the open-access phase three cardiac
events were reported, none of which were rela-
ted to the study device or study procedure as the
three participants had a previous history of
cardiovascular disease prior to study entry.
There were no reports of diabetic ketoacidosis or
hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
In total, serious adverse or adverse events
(n = 135) were experienced by 60 (43%) of 139
participants. There were nine occurrences of a
serious adverse event, none of which were
related to the device, study procedure, or to
hypoglycemia. Nine mild hypoglycemia adverse
events were experienced by two participants
and were reported by the clinician as not related
to the study device at all or to the study pro-
cedure. Five participants experienced an adverse
event in the open-access phase, leading to
withdrawal from the study; two due to death
(not associated with the device or study) and

participants reported 16 device-related adverse

reactions, primarily treated with topical prepa-
rations and all were resolved.

symptoms observed for 28 (20%) participants.
These symptoms were primarily (n = 117; 87%)
due to the sensor wear (erythema, itching and
rash) and most were resolved without medical
intervention; 63 were mild in nature, 67 were
moderate and four were severe. Adverse events
and anticipated symptoms associated with the
insertion of the sensor and sensor wear are
summarized in Table 3 and Table S1 in the
supplementary material.
DISCUSSION
The REPLACE study was the first to publish data
investigating the use of flash sensor-based glu-
cose technology as a replacement for standard
SMBG in individuals with type 2 diabetes trea-
ted with multi-dose insulin therapy. The find-
ings from the treatment phase of the study have
demonstrated that flash glucose monitoring
technology is a safe replacement for blood glu-
cose monitoring and that the use of the tech-
nology is associated with reduced time in
hypoglycemia,
particularly
nocturnal
hypo-
glycemia [9]. During the additional 6 month
open-access phase, reductions in time in hypo-
glycemia were maintained across all age groups,
with sustained benefit continued during night-
time. Our findings from a further 6 months of
using flash glucose sensing technology reinforce
those from the 6 months of use in the REPLACE
study [9], demonstrating that the device is safe
with repetitive, consecutive use over an exten-
ded period of 12 month for adults, irrespective
of age, and that the benefit of reduced hypo-
glycemia is sustained. In addition, our data
reinforce the significant reductions in hypo-
glycemia shown by Bolinder et al. in the
IMPACT study for adults with well-controlled
type 1 diabetes using flash technology [11].

 potentially harmful [2, 12]. However, both the
ADA and the European Association for the
Study of Diabetes (EASD) consider glucose levels
below 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) as serious and
clinically important [13] due to the associated
risks of cardiac arrhythmias [14, 15] and mor-
tality in type 2 diabetes [16, 17]. Notably, our
findings of significantly less time in overall
hypoglycemia included time at the lower glu-
cose thresholds, and this benefit was main-
tained over 12 months. Furthermore, a 30%
reduction in hypoglycemia is considered to be
clinically significant [2], and the use of flash
technology
reduced
time
in
hypoglycemia
[3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)] by 50% at 12 months
compared to baseline.
Time in hypoglycemia began to decrease as
soon as participants were able to utilize sensor
glucose readings for self-management (day 15 of
the treatment phase; Fig. 6) and was signifi-
cantly reduced at 12 months.

 No change in insulin doses was observed, sug-
gesting that the trend arrow with numerical and
graphical sensor glucose information displayed
on the reader is of value to support self-manage-
ment of hypoglycemia detection, prevention and
avoidance. The value of continuous monitoring
data for self-care modification rather than therapy
adjustments has been noted previously for indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes treated with oral
therapies [18] and basal insulin [19].
High deployment of the device continued
with a utility rate of 84%, and sensor scanning
frequency averaged seven times daily with vir-
tually no recourse to blood glucose testing.
There was no difference in device use or scan-
ning rate for those younger or older than
65 years, demonstrating confident use of the
technology across all adult age groups, which
supports current recommendations that those
over 65 years should have access to continuous
monitoring technology [1].
At the end of the treatment phase, all of the
intervention subjects opted to continue into the
open-access phase and highly concordant use of
the sensor continued. This suggests that flash
glucose technology is acceptable as a method of
glucose monitoring and that it does not appear
to have the same nuisance [20, 21] and variable
concordance issues that can be experienced
with longer term CGM use [1].
There was no difference in change for time
in hyperglycemia compared to baseline at the
end of the open-access phase. Of interest, time
in hyperglycemia had risen during the treat-
ment phase and subsequently dropped back to
baseline values at 12 months. Mean glucose
had also risen during the treatment phase and
dropped
back
towards
baseline
values
at
12 months. These apparent rises during the
treatment phase were not statistically signifi-
cantly different to the control group at 6
months. Highly speculative reasoning for this
is that previously undetected hypoglycemia,
particularly nocturnal, may affect a retrospec-
tive
fear
of
hypoglycemia
reoccurrence,
prompting a resistance to treatment intensifi-
cation
to
address
hyperglycemia.
Although
there was no significant change in fear of
hypoglycemia in the intervention group com-
pared
to
the
control
group
[9],
any
hypoglycemia
and
especially
nocturnal
is
feared by those with type 2 diabetes [3] and
this may partially explain why there was no
change in time in hyperglycemia as it was not
actively addressed with therapy adjustments.
Similar to the treatment phase, there were no
safety
concerns
during
the
12-month-long
open-access phase. Skin reactions were reported
for nine (6.5%) participants during the open-ac-
cess phase and six participants (4.0%) in the
treatment phase (preceding 6 months). With any
medical device that is attached to the body, skin
reactions will be experienced by some individu-
als. Longer duration of sensor wear likely con-
tributes to this [22]. There is little published data
on using a device attached to the body with
medical grade adhesive; the type of events in our
study are similar to those reported for use of flash
technology in adults with type 1 diabetes over
6 months [11] and for other systems with
on-body sensor use [20, 21].
The original randomized, controlled trial
conducted over 6 months included interven-
tion and control participants; only interven-
tion
participants
continued
into
the
open-access phase for a further 6 months. This
is a limitation to our study; however, the
primary endpoint of the open-access phase
was to assess safety over an extended period of
use. A final HbA1c measurement, although of
clinical interest, has little value when evalu-
ating safety or the overall effectiveness of
flash technology. Similarly, quality of life and
patient-reported
outcome
questionnaires
could also have been completed at 12 months.
In all phases of the study, our aim was to test
the new technology in ‘‘real world’’ condi-
tions. Having restrictive protocols for treat-
ment
changes
would
have
made
general
applicability of our data uncertain. Therefore,
this work is limited by the modification of
insulin therapy according to local practice
rather than using a treatment algorithm. Our
inclusion of only adults with type 2 diabetes
treated with intensive insulin therapy who
performed
regular
glucose
testing
means
future studies are needed to assess the effec-
tiveness of flash glucose-sensing technology
in younger, less concordant, individuals for
modifying insulin therapy.

 CONCLUSION
In summary, the use of sensor glucose readings
over a 12- month period for glucose self-man-
agement by individuals with type 2 diabetes
treated
with
intensive
insulin
therapy
was
associated
with
significant
and
sustained
reductions in hypoglycemic measures across all
age groups with no safety concerns. Our find-
ings confirm that longer term use of the con-
venient flash glucose sensing technology is safe
and effective and eliminates the need for stan-
dard SMBG for glycemic management of type 2
diabetes treated by intensive insulin therapy
with multiple daily injections or CSII.
