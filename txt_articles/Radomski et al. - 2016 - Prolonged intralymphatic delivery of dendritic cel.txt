Abstract
Background: The currently-used modes of administration of immunotherapeutic agents result in their limited
delivery to the lymph nodes and/or require repetitive ultrasound-guided nodal injections or microsurgical
lymphatic injections, limiting their feasibility. Here, we report on the feasibility and safety of a new method of long-
term repetitive intralymphatic (IL) infusion of immune cells, using implantable delivery ports.
Methods: Nine patients with stage IV recurrent colorectal cancer underwent complete resection and received
autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with killed autologous tumor cells, KLH and PADRE, for up to four monthly
cycles. Leg lymphatic vessels were cannulated, connected to 6.6Fr low-profile implantable subcutaneous delivery
ports, and used to infuse 12 doses of DC over each 72 h-long cycle (every 6 h), followed by heparin flushes of the
cannula-port system (one 72 h-long cycle per month). The patients who opted for alternative route of vaccine
administration (2 patients) or whose ports became non-functional between cycles, continued treatment via intranodal
(one injection/cycle) or intradermal (four injections/cycle) routes.
Results: A total of nine lymphatic cannulations and implantations of subcutaneous delivery ports were attempted in
seven patients, with a success rate of eight out of nine (89 %). The average patency of the IL delivery system was 7.5
(±3.2) weeks. All six patients with IL ports successfully completed at least one complete 72 h-long DC infusion cycle (12
injections). Five patients (56 %) completed two full IL cycles (24 IL injections). No patients received more than two IL
cycles without replacement of the IL port, due to catheter occlusion and/or local side effects: cellulitis and hematoma.
Intranodal and intradermal backup options were used in, respectively, one and two patients. Overall cohort survival
was >28 (±25) months. One patient with aggressive recurrent carcinomatosis, who received DC vaccines by intranodal
route is alive at > 90 months, without evidence of disease.
Conclusions: We conclude that an intermediate-duration IL delivery of multiple doses of immunotherapeutic factors
using implantable delivery ports is feasible, highly-tolerable and can be reproducibly performed in cancer patients to
administer immune cells, or potentially, other immune factors. However, long-term IL port placement (>7.5 weeks), is
not a currently-feasible option.

 Background
Several forms of immunotherapy have recently proven
their clinical effectiveness in different forms of cancer,
but the preferred mode of delivery of immunotherapeu-
tic agents, including cellular products, allowing their op-
timal anti-cancer effects and minimal systemic toxicity
remains unknown. In particular, systemic delivery of cel-
lular therapeutic agents, such as Provenge, or adoptively
transferred T cells results in preferential retention of
such cells in liver, and lungs with very rapid loss of cells
over time, which requires systemic cytokine support
and/or myeloablation regimens. Similar, the delivery of
therapeutic dendritic cell (DC) vaccines [1, 2] via sub-
cutaneous or intradermal routes allows only very modest
fraction of DCs (0.1–2 %) to enter the lymph nodes
(LN). Moreover, the relatively long transit times of sub-
cutaneously injected DCs [3, 4] can result in reduced
ability of DCs to produce desirable type-1 cytokines and
chemokines by long-term activated DC [5, 6].
In an attempt to overcome these problems, early pro-
tocols involved the injection of very high numbers of
DCs (107–108 cells) presenting challenges with generat-
ing adequate numbers of cells, high costs and logistic
challenges. Direct intranodal injection under ultrasound
guidance has been utilized to deliver vaccine to the sec-
ondary lymphoid organs, but such method is technically
challenging, often leads to the counterproductive DC ac-
cumulation in perinodal fat tissue and lymph node dam-
age [7]. Direct intralymphatic (IL) injection of DCs using
repeated temporary cannulations, similar to the method
traditionally used in lymph-node mapping, has been suc-
cessfully tested in a small number of patients [8, 9].
However, intermittent dosing with large “pulse” doses of
DCs via the IL route does not mirror a physiological re-
sponse nor is it feasible to perform repetitively, due to
scar formation, high amount of personnel time and lo-
gistic challenges.
To increase the feasibility of repeated intralymphatic
delivery of DCs (and potentially other factors such as T
cells, stimulatory cytokines or checkpoint blockers) over
multiple treatment courses, we tested the feasibility of
using implantable ports, such as those used for intra-
venous access, to avoid the need for related lymphatic
cannulations. We developed a modification of the method
originally used to collect the outflowing lymph over
periods of up to 10 days [10–13]. The key modifications
involved a semi-permanent implantable subcutaneous
delivery port to allow multiple injections and limit the
infection risk, and heparinization of the port/catheter
system to preserve its long-term patency in the absence of
continuous lymph outflow. Herein, we report on the feasi-
bility and limitations of implanting such lymphatic access
ports in advanced cancer patients undergoing experimental
DC therapy.
Results
Feasibility of intralymphatic port placement and duration
of port patency
A total of nine patients with stage IV CRC underwent
R0 resection (Table 1). The average age of the cohort
was 51 (± 11.25) years. The cannulation was not
attempted in two patients, who, for logistic reasons,
started the experimental treatment using intranodal or
intradermal delivery routes.
Six of the remaining seven patients successfully re-
ceived IL ports. Only one patient’s lymphatic system
could not be cannulated. Two patients were successfully
re-cannulated following the occlusion of the initially
functional ports. A total of nine IL ports were attempted
to be placed in a total of seven patients (including re-
placement ports in 2 patients) and a total of eight of
nine attempted cannulations and port implantations
were successful, corresponding to 89 % success rate
(Figs. 1a-1c, and Fig. 2).
Port patency was confirmed at the time of implantation
via lymphangiogram (Fig. 1d). Ports were flushed weekly
with heparinized saline to prevent occlusion and confirm
patency. Average port patency was 7.5 (± 3.2) weeks
(Table 2). All patients who received a port had at least 1
course of IL vaccine. Five patients (56 %) successfully re-
ceived at least 2 concurrent courses of IL vaccine (patients
1, 2, 4, 5, 6). No patients received more than 2 concurrent
courses of IL vaccine without having the port replaced
due to catheter occlusion or study withdrawal secondary
to disease progression (patient 6). Three of the six patients
(50 %) who received IL catheters received only IL admin-
istered vaccine (patients 1, 5, and 6). The most common
complications encountered were loss of catheter patency,
which occurred in 6 of 7 instances (patients 1-twice, 2, 3,
4, and 5, 86 %) followed by cellulitis occurring in 3 (43 %)
of 7 instances (Table 2). One patient, #2, had recurrent
cellulitis diagnosed at 1, 5, and 10 weeks and treated on
an outpatient basis with oral antibiotics. Two patients (5
& 6, 33.3 %) had symptoms of flushing at the time of vac-
cine infusion which resolved after cessation of the infu-
sion. One patient (16.6 %) had a small infected hematoma
that was treated with oral antibiotics (patient 1). Other
self-limited side effects reported were erythema at the
injection site, fatigue, and diarrhea.
DTH
No patients had an initial positive DTH reaction to
tumor lysate, KLH, or PADRE peptide. Patient 5 had a
minimal positive DTH reaction to KLH at 6 weeks
measuring 3 x 4 mm while patient 6 had the strongest
positive DTH reaction to KLH at weeks 6 and 14 meas-
uring 33 x 40 mm and 48 x 45 mm, respectively
(Table 3).

 Survival
The average time to progression from the administration
of vaccine was 3.4 (± 2.1) months. The average survival
for the cohort after the initiation of vaccine was 28 (± 25)
months. Of the 9 patients, 1 patient (7.5 %) is still alive
(greater than 90 months after the initial DC treatment
date, 128 months after initial diagnosis of Stage IV dis-
ease). Of interest, that patient had a history of recurrent
carcinomatosis and four prior resections due to recurrent
disease, but is still alive without evidence of disease at
>90 months after the fourth surgery and intranodal DC
administration (Fig. 3). She received a total of 4.9x106 cells
via 3 intranodal injections.
No correlation was observed between amount of vac-
cine given and time to progression or survival in the
overall treated cohort.
Discussion
We
evaluated
the
feasibility
and
safety
of
semi-
continuous intralymphatic infusions as a means of con-
tinued delivery of human cells, and potentially other
factors to the lymph nodes of cancer patients. Short-
term intralymphatic cannulation has been routinely used
in imaging studies (regional lymph node mapping) and
has been previously used for dendritic cell delivery.
However, repeated cannulations are not feasible in rou-
tine clinical practice due to logistic and cost consider-
ations, as well as increased risk of infections, fibrosis,
and damage to neurovascular structures and as well as
patient discomfort. While prolonged cannulation of
lymphatic vessels to collect human lymph and associated
cells has been successfully used in several studies, the
feasibility of repeated access of lymphatic vessels in the
absence of continued lymph flow has not been tested.
Our current results demonstrate that even one month-
long lymphatic cannulations (up to 7.5 weeks) are feas-
ible and can be reliably performed to deliver multiple
doses of human immune cells, using implantable sub-
cutaneous delivery ports. While our current data does
not support immunologic or clinical advantage of using
this route to deliver dendritic cell vaccines (our longest-
surviving patient received exclusively intranodal DC

 injections), it remains to be tested if the method de-
scribed can be used to administer other types of immune
cells, checkpoint blockers or immunostimulatory cyto-
kines, to increase their effectiveness and limit systemic
toxicities. One potential application is the adoptive
transfer of tumor-specific T cells, which are typically
retained in lung and liver and show very short half-life
following intravenous administration [14] to promote
immune memory and sustained therapeutic effects.
Despite our initial concerns that the patency of the
intralymphatic ports in the absence of lymph flow will
require maintaining the catheter flow using low-rate
saline infusion (which was also effective, clinicaltrials.gov
NCT00390339) due to the presence of fibrin and the
documented ability of lymph for form clots [15]. We
observed that it can also be maintained by weekly
heparin flushes, or an overage period of 7.5 weeks. In
contrast, in none of the patients we managed to

 maintain the patency of the system for longer than
8 weeks, due to recurrent complications and port occlu-
sion. The most frequent complication was port occlu-
sions.
These
complications
may
be
prospectively
alleviated by designing a T-tube type catheter which
would cannulate the lymphatic vessel both proximally
and distally and thus allow flow through the device.
We also observed a high rate of cellulitis in the areas
of intralymphatic port implantation, which phenomenon
might have been promoted by the presence of a foreign
body in an area of inhibited lymphatic flow, thus causing
a localized inflammatory reaction. Additionally, ports
were placed in the groin which may have facilitated a
high infectious risk, as it is known that femoral central
venous catheters have a high infectious risk over central
venous catheters placed in other areas of the body [16].
However, all cases of cellulitis were controlled with oral
antibiotic therapy and we did not observe formation of
abscesses, positive cultures, or blood born infections.
To date, no studies have examined the long-term use
of intralymphatic ports as a delivery mechanism. A study
by Juillard et al. showed the feasibility of repeated
monthly intralymphatic injections of irradiated tumor
cells at a concentration (1x107 cells per mL) in 21 pa-
tients with various advanced malignancies [17]. Another
study performed by Lesimple et al. evaluated 14 patients
with metastatic melanoma who received ex vivo matured
dendritic cells pulsed with tumor peptides on a monthly
basis. Study participants received the initial dose of vac-
cine via a single intralymphatic injection in the foot,
followed by intranodal injections at 4 and 8 weeks [18].
Grover et al. delivered high doses (2x108) autologous
dendritic cells loaded with melanoma associated peptide
antigens in 6 patients, using repeated lymphatic cannula-
tion [19].
While our study demonstrates the feasibility of pro-
longed cannulation of human lymphatic vessels, it does
not provide an indication of an advantage of this route
to deliver DC vaccines. The two long-term survivors in
our study had either intranodal or intradermal delivery
of vaccine and all but one patient in the study cohort
had progression of their underlying disease. Even with
aggressive disease (three prior resections of the repeti-
tively recurring intraperitoneal tumor), patient 7 in our
study had no recurrence after administration of the vac-
cine. Interestingly, this patient had a high level of micro-
satellite instability that may be uniquely responsive to
immunotherapy [20]. Despite a good clinical outcome,
contrary to our expectations, this patient had a negative
DTH response to all antigens tested.
Conclusions
Our data demonstrate that prolonged intralymphatic
port placement (up to 7.5 weeks) is a feasible option to
repetitive (re)cannulations of lymphatic vessels to repeti-
tively administer DCs or other factors. In contrast, but
long-term intralymphatic port placement is not a cur-
rently feasible option due to port complications (occlu-
sion and cellulitis). Although the current study did not
provide us with any indications of a potential advantage
of using this route to administer DC vaccines, the feasi-
bility of cannulating lymphatic vessels over multiple days
and weeks may provide an alternative to the current
routes of delivery of other types of immune cells or im-
munotherapeutic drugs.
Methods
Patient population and study design
A total of 9 patients were enrolled in the study under
the University of Pittsburgh IRB-approved protocol
UPCI 05–063 (NCT00558051), following informed con-
sent. Inclusion criteria consisted of ECOG performance
status of 0 through 2, age greater than 18, platelet count
greater than 100000 per μL, hematocrit greater than 27,
white blood cell count greater than 2000 per μL, creatin-
ine and bilirubin levels less than or equal to two-times
Fig. 3 Clinical course of the disease and previous treatments of Patient # 7, the remaining long-term survivor without evidence of recurrent disease. That
patient with high-level of microsatellite instability had three prior resections of the repetitively recurring intraperitoneal tumor, but remains without any
sign of disease recurrence >90 months following the fourth resection, which was combined with intranodal DC vaccine administration

 the upper limit of normal, adequate recovery from all
side effects of their previous therapy, no chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, major surgery, or biologic therapy for their
malignancy in the 2 weeks prior to the vaccine adminis-
tration, and patients must undergo surgical resection of
metastatic colorectal cancer to minimal evidence of dis-
ease (R0 or R1 status). Exclusion criteria included recent
(less than 2 weeks) immunosuppressive treatment, in-
cluding steroids, uncontrolled pain, active autoimmune
disease, positive serology for hepatitis B, C, or HIV, al-
lergy to heparin or local anesthetic, concurrent addition-
ally malignancy, and pregnancy.
Patients received DCs by one of three routes: intralym-
phatic, intradermal or intranodal. The intralymphatic
route was prioritized, with the intradermal or intranodal
adminstration serving as backup options for patients
who could not be cannulated, either due to the failure of
(attempted) catheter implantation or due to logistics
(without attempted cannulation), such as a patient’s re-
luctance to undergo inpatient treatment over 4 nights
per course (needed for intralymphatic infusions).
All patients underwent an R0 resection and tumor
cells were prepared and cryopreserved by the University
of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Immunologic Monitoring
and Cellular Products Laboratory (IMCPL) until gener-
ation of the DC product. Patients in each group were
considered evaluable if they have received 2 cycles of
vaccine by any route. Patients whose intralymphatic de-
livery system lost patency could either be re-cannulated
or continue to receive the DCs by alternative routes. Fol-
lowing the accrual of the three patients who each suc-
cessfully completed at least two intralymphatic courses,
the remaining patients got the option of starting the
treatment using the backup routes. Therapy could be
discontinued at any time under the following conditions:
disease progression, intercurrent illness that prevents ad-
ministration of vaccine, unacceptable adverse event(s),
severe reaction to delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH)
testing, patient withdrawal, dosing delays greater than
4 weeks, and negative changes in the patient’s general
condition. Patients with remaining vaccine could receive
additional courses of vaccination by any route.
Leukapheresis and preparation of autologous tumor-loaded
DCs
After recovery from surgery, each patient underwent
limited 90 min leukopheresis. Monocytes were isolated
from the pheresis product by the IMCPL, using the Elutra
Cell Separation System, washed, and plated at a concen-
tration of 0.5-1x106 cells/mL in tissue culture flasks in
therapeutic grade antibiotic free CellGro® Serum-free
Media (CellGenix GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) with 1000
U/mL GM-CSF (UPCI Pharmacy, Pittsburgh, PA) and
1000 U/mL IL-4 (CellGenix GmbH, Freiburg, Germany)
followed by incubation at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 [21]. After
by 5–7 day cultures and were matured for 42–48 h in
alpha-type-1 polarizing cytokine cocktail [21] consisting of
IL-1β (25 ng/mL, CellGenix GmbH, Freiburg, Germany),
TNF-α (50 ng/mL, CellGenix GmbH, Freiburg, Germany),
IFNα (3000 U/mL, Merck Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ),
poly-I:C (20 mg/mL, EMD Millipore, Philadelphia, PA) and
IFNγ (1000 U/mL, InterMune Inc, Brisbane, CA) [21].
Fresh tumor tissues were minced and incubated with
collagenase and DNAse, washed thrice with normal saline,
UVB- and γ-irradiated with 20,000 Rads to induce apop-
tosis. Apoptotic tumor cells and either KLH protein
(50 mg/mL, Biosyn Corp, Carlsbad, CA) or PADRE
peptide (20 mg/mL, University of Pittsburgh Peptide
Synthesis Facility, Pittsburgh, PA) were added to the
autologous DCs (KLH- or PADRE-supplemented DC
product was used in every second cycle of vaccination) at
the time of the induction of maturation. Mature antigen-
loaded DCs were harvested after 42–48 h, washed three
times with sterile pH 7.2 PBS, and tested for sterility and
other release criteria (endotoxin less than 5.0 EU/kg of
body weight, DC viability > 70 %, CD83 > 70 % on CCR7 >
50 % on live DCs, less than 10 % contaminating CD3+,
CD19+ or CD14+ cells. The ability of DCs to produce
IL-12p70 following stimulation with CD40L-transfected
J558 cells has been evaluated, as described before [5, 22].
DC vaccine administration
Patients receiving intralymphatic infusions had a low
profile implantable access port placed by cut down and
cannulation of the femoral lymphatic vessel of either the
right or left leg. In brief, a minimal volume of Isosulfan
Blue (Covidien Inc, Mansfield, MA) was injected into
the intradermal space 15 cm distally from the inguinal
crease and massaged to facilitate lymphatic drainage. An
incision was made 5 cm proximally to the dye injection
site and dissection was carried down to the femoral
lymphatic vessel which was isolated and encircled with
vessel ties to obtain proximal and distal control. Using
an operative microscope, the femoral lymphatic vessel
was incised with a scalpel and cannulated with a 6.6 Fr
BardPort MRI Low Profile Implanted Port (Bard Access
Systems, Salt Lake City, UT) under direct vision. The
catheter was secured with absorbable suture. Blunt
dissection was used to make a subcutaneous pocket for
the port at an easily accessible area of the thigh. A
lymphangiogram was obtained to confirm placement
and patency of the port. On days of administration of
the IL vaccine, patients were admitted to the Clinical &
Translational
Research
Center
(CTRC)
at
UPMC
Montefiore Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA. Ports were accessed
in a sterile fashion and vaccine was delivered via slow
infusion (0.5 mL over 1 min) followed by albumin

Page 7 of 9
 injection (0.2–0.5 mL over 1 min) and a heparin flush
(0.5 mL over 1 min). Vaccine, albumin, and heparin
flushes were carried out every 6 h for a total of 96 h
within each treatment course. Each course of intralym-
phatic treatment consisted of 16 divided doses of autolo-
gous tumor-loaded DCs totaling 2x106 cells/course.
Treatment courses were administered every 4 weeks.
Patients that had port complications or were unable to
have a port placed could receive the remaining DC
product by either intranodal or intradermal injections.
Intradermal vaccinations were administered as 4 daily
injections of autologous tumor loaded DCs (1 mL)
administered over 4 days per course (2x106 cells/course)
on an outpatient basis. A single course of vaccine was
administered every 4 weeks. Injections were in the vicin-
ity of the major nodal basin of the thigh.
Intranodal
vaccines
were
administered
as
single
ultrasound-guided intranodal injections (1 mL) of autolo-
gous tumor loaded vaccine per course (2x106 cells/course),
in either the inguinal or axillary lymph node basins. A sin-
gle course of vaccine was administered every 4 weeks.
Delivery sites were rotated to avoid excessive lymph node
damage and scar formation. Injected lymph nodes were
between 5 and 20 mm in size.
Patient- and port evaluation and surveillance
During the treatment period, patients had a complete phys-
ical examination with performance status on each day of
vaccination. Attempted blood collections for in vitro
analysis occurred at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 22, and 24. One
patient had a repeat blood draw at 2 years. Patients with
intralymphatic ports were followed by weekly evaluations
and port flushes for up to 12 weeks, in addition to their
routine follow-up for their underlying disease. The absence
of occlusion of the port/intralymphatic delivery system was
confirmed at each point by port flushes. All patients were
evaluated 2 weeks after the last course of vaccination and
then monthly for 5 months total. Lifelong follow-up con-
sisted of patients being contacted every 3 months within
the first 3 years post-treatment, every 6 months until year
5, then annually afterwards. Patients without evidence of
disease progression were eligible for re-vaccination on a
monthly basis starting at least 4 weeks after the previous
vaccination.
Delayed Type Hypersensitivity Testing (DTH)
Baseline DTH testing against the autologous tumor cell
lysate and to the heterologous helper antigens KLH
protein and PADRE peptides occurred on the first day of
vaccine administration followed by subsequent tests at 6
and 14 weeks. Testing consisted of 100 μL intradermal
injections of the autologous tumor cell lysate used in the
vaccine, whole vaccine (both the PADRE and KLH con-
taining variants), PADRE peptide (100 μg), and KLH
protein (100 μg) at different sites. Skin tests were read at
48 h. A positive DTH response against antigen was de-
fined as an increase of 3 mm of induration post den-
dritic cell vaccine over pre-dendritic cell vaccine. Vehicle
(PBS at pH 7.4) was used as the negative control in both
pre and post- dendritic cell vaccine evaluations.
Abbreviations
