Abstract 
Background: The majority of research examining the barriers to breastfeeding focuses on the 
physical challenges faced by mothers rather than the risks of encountering negative emotional 
and practical feeding experiences. 
Objective: To quantify the emotional and practical experiences of the overall sample of  
breastfeeding mothers and identify the differences in the emotional and practical experiences 
of  exclusively breastfeeding mothers (EBF) and combination feeding mothers (Combi), by 
feeding type and intention. 
Design, Setting and Participants: 845 mothers with infants up to 26 weeks of age and who 
had initiated breastfeeding were recruited through relevant social media via advertisements 
providing a link to an online survey.  
Variables studied: Predictors of emotional experiences included guilt, stigma, satisfaction 
with feeding method, and the need to defend themselves due to infant feeding choices. 
Practical predictors included perceived support from health professionals, main sources of 
infant feeding information, and respect from their everyday environment, workplace, and 
when breastfeeding in public.   
Outcome measures: Current feeding type and prenatal feeding intention.  
Results: In the overall sample 15% of the mothers reported feeling guilty, 38% stigmatised 
and 55% felt the need to defend their feeding choice. Binary logit models revealed that guilt 
and dissatisfaction were directly associated with feeding type, being higher when 
supplementing with formula. No associations with feeding intention were identified. 
Discussion and conclusions: This study demonstrates a link between current breastfeeding 
promotion strategies and the emotional state of breastfeeding mothers who supplement with 
 3 
 
formula to any extent. To minimise the negative impact on maternal wellbeing it is important 
that future recommendations recognise the challenges that exclusive breastfeeding brings and 
provide a more balanced and realistic target for mothers. 
Key messages: 
1.       Mothers who supplement their breastfeeding with formula are almost six times more 
likely to feel guilty and three times more likely to feed dissatisfied with their infant feeding 
choice than mothers who exclusively breastfeed, with the guilt being internally sourced. 
2.       Mothers who exclusively breastfeed often face externally induced guilt, with family 
being the most frequently reported source. 
3.       While nursing in public may be anticipated to be the most popular source of 
stigmatisation experienced by breastfeeding mothers, the vast majority of participants 
reported that the public response was moderately to very respectful. 
4.       Despite current legislation and policy regarding working rights of mothers, a need to 
defend feeding choices in the workplace was reported by exclusively breastfeeding mothers. 
Introduction 
Although breastfeeding initiation rates have steadily increased in the UK over the past two 
decades; 62% in 1990 to 81% in 2010 (Bolling et al., 2007; McAndrew, F., Thompson, J., 
Fellows, L., Large, A., Speed and Renfrew, 2012), the number of mothers who breastfeed 
their infant exclusively has failed to rise. In 2010, just 1% of women were exclusively 
breastfeeding up until the nationally recommended six month juncture (McAndrew et al., 
2012). It appears that despite virtually all mothers and healthy term babies possessing the 
physiological capacity to successfully breastfeed, the majority (88%) use formula in some 
quantity in the first six months (McAndrew et al., 2012). This indicates the presence of 
 4 
 
factors creating barriers to the most health promoting infant feeding outcomes (Neifert and 
Bunik, 2013). 
Quantitative literature examining the barriers to breastfeeding has been orientated towards the 
physical challenges encountered by breastfeeding mothers. On the other hand, a large body of 
qualitative literature has previously highlighted the negative emotional and practical 
experiences of exclusively breastfeeding and combination feeding mothers (Burns et al., 
2010; Hauck et al., 2002; Hegney et al., 2008; Lee, 2007; Leeming et al., 2013; Nelson, 2006; 
Thomson et al., 2015; Wray, 2013). Moreover, in a number of studies these experiences are 
looked at through the lens of postnatal depression and its association with breastfeeding 
initiation, duration, exclusivity, or related difficulties (Brown et al., 2016; Dennis and 
McQueen, 2007, 2009; Henderson et al., 2003; McCarter-Spaulding and Horowitz, 2007; 
Shakespeare et al., 2004). However, breastfeeding mothers without a postnatal mood disorder 
are also susceptible to negative emotional responses. Whilst many consider breastfeeding as a 
cornerstone of their maternal experience, a body of qualitative work highlights an array of 
potential negative emotions. These include shame about breastfeeding in public (Davis, 2004; 
Taylor and Wallace, 2012), embarrassment about breastfeeding in front of family and friends 
(Smyth, 2008), and stigmatisation for breastfeeding in a “bottle feeding culture” (Scott & 
Mostyn, 2003; Dykes & Moran, 2003).   
Current breastfeeding promotion may inadvertently contribute to negative feeding 
experiences. Although designed to convey the health benefits of this approach to infant 
feeding it may instead situate breastfeeding as the “moral” and “responsible” mothering 
choice (K. Williams et al., 2012b). As a result, failure to breastfeed becomes a major source 
of both internal and external guilt and stigma (Knaak, 2010; Marshall et al., 2007). 
Breastfeeding mothers may feel direct and indirect external pressure to supplement or 
substitute breastfeeding with formula (Arora et al., 2000; Baranowski et al., 1983; Tanner and 
 5 
 
Cockerill, 1996). With the decision to introduce formula considered suboptimal, qualitative 
studies often report that mothers also feel the need to internally justify this choice. (Stewart-
Knox et al., 2003; Tanner and Cockerill, 1996; K. Williams et al., 2012a, 2012b). 
Mothers who exclusively breastfeed for the first six months of their infant’s life are acting in 
accordance with current guidelines. Yet, this moralistic approach still renders them 
susceptible to negative emotional responses to the feeding process. The source of these 
emotions can be different from those who formula feed their baby (K. Williams et al., 2012b) 
and may reflect a perceived internal conflict between their sense of duty as a mother and a 
desire to attend to their own personal needs (Hauck and Irurita, 2003). Exclusively 
breastfeeding mothers can also find themselves facing conflicting and incompatible 
expectations from their close external environment, with family, work and social obligations 
proving unavoidable burdens to breastfeeding (Wray, 2013).  
This large-scale internet study is the first to quantify the emotional and practical experiences 
of an overall sample of breastfeeding mothers and identify the differences in the emotional 
and practical experiences of exclusively breastfeeding mothers (EBF) and combination 
feeding mothers (Combi), by feeding type and intention. It was hypothesised that mothers 
who chose to supplement with formula (Combi) would be more susceptible to negative 
experiences as opposed to those who chose to exclusively breastfeed (EBF). Furthermore, it 
was proposed that the source of negative feelings would differ according to feeding type with 
negative emotions in EBF mothers arising from external sources and in combi mothers from 
internal sources. Finally, with a related survey of formula feeding mothers (Fallon et al, in 
submission) reporting a strong association between feeding intentions in pregnancy and 
negative feeding experiences, a further aim was to examine whether the experiences of 
breastfeeding mothers would also differ according to feeding intention in pregnancy.

Method 
Ethical approval 
The study gained ethical approval from the University of Liverpool Institute of Psychology, 
Health and Society Ethics Committee in March 2015. All aspects of the study were 
performed in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were provided 
with an information sheet and informed consent was gained with a tick box. The online 
survey was accessible from 30/3/2015 to 12/4/2015.  
Participants and Demographics 
A total of 845 mothers of infants up to 26 weeks of age, who were currently breastfeeding in 
any quantity, were recruited through relevant social media sites and mailing lists via 
advertisements providing a link to the Qualtrics survey software. The 26 weeks cut off point 
applied reflects the current WHO exclusive breastfeeding recommendations (WHO, 2015).  
The advertisements stated that participants were invited to take part in a short study which 
would examine the opinions and experiences of breastfeeding mothers. Women who were 
exclusively formula feeding, younger than 16 years of age, or non-English-speaking, were 
not eligible to participate. Of the 845 participants, 151 (17.9%) were excluded from final 
analyses as they did not complete the study. A further 7 participants, who reported the 
intention to exclusively formula feed, were also excluded due to statistical issues introduced 
by the small group size. 
Maternal age, marital status, and country of residence were initially asked. To assess socio-
economic status mothers were asked to report their current occupation (or if currently on 
maternity leave, previous occupation). The simplified National Statistics Socio-economic 
Classification, which contains 8 occupation classifications was then applied (ONS, 2010). 
 7 
 
Only mothers who reported previous occupation were asked questions related to their return 
to their previous employment.  Information relating to the infant such as birth order and age 
in weeks was also obtained. 
Exposure Variables 
The survey had a similar study design with previous work examining the emotional and 
practical experiences of formula feeding mothers (Fallon et al., under review). The first part 
of the survey assessed the practical experiences of breastfeeding mothers.  Questions 
included the perceived level of infant feeding support that mothers received from health 
professionals, the perceived level of respect displayed by their everyday environment with 
regards to their feeding choices, and the perceived level of satisfaction experienced as a result 
of their feeding choices.  In addition, mothers were asked whether they had breastfed in 
public, and if so the perceived level of respect at the time of this event. Where applicable, 
mothers were also asked about perceived respect for their feeding choices at the workplace 
(displayed or expected). All answers were provided via a 5-point likert scale (higher 
responses indicated higher levels of support, respect, and satisfaction). Finally, mothers were 
also asked about their main source of information about infant feeding. Potential responses 
included the media, health professionals, family members, other mothers, or previous 
experiences/own accord.   
The second part of the survey examined the emotional experiences of breastfeeding mothers.  
Respondents were asked to provide a binary (yes/ no) response to indicate the presence of 
feelings of guilt, stigma and the need to defend as a result their infant feeding choices. 
Positive responses were followed up to identify the source of the feelings (see table 1).  
Participants were able to choose more than one source if applicable.  A positive response to 
the presence of guilt was also followed up to ascertain whether the feelings were experienced 
 8 
 
internally, as a result of other’s opinions, or both. For stigma, two additional choices were 
added relating to the working environment and when breastfeeding in public. The structure 
and content of the questionnaire is presented in table 1.  
Outcome Variables  
The outcome variables were current feeding type and feeding intention in pregnancy. 
Available answers were based on WHO-defined categories (WHO, 2002). At the time of 
completion, five different categories were available to the mothers (exclusively breast feeding 
from birth; breastfeeding to start with but now a little formula; breastfeeding to start with but 
now some formula; breastfeeding to start with but now mostly formula, and combination 
feeding from birth).  
Feeding intention was asked retrospectively, at the end of the study, to avoid response bias on 
answers relating to the emotional experiences 
Statistical analysis 
All analyses were conducted using the IBM SPSS 22 software package. Descriptive statistics 
were generated for demographic and exposure variables of interest (Tables 2 and 3).  
Independent samples t-test and 2 tests were used to examine bivariate associations between 
study variables and both feeding type, and feeding intention.  Relative risk ratio’s (RRRs) for 
the association between exposure and outcome variables were then calculated using binary 
logit models. Separate models were built for feeding type and feeding intention. Backward 
elimination was used to build the adjusted models and demographic variables were kept as 
confounders in the model if they changed the beta coefficients of the exposure categories by 
more than 10%. Feeding intention and feeding type were also included as potential 
confounders in the opposing models. Exposure categories were collapsed to a 3 point scale 
 9 
 
during the analysis (See tables 4 and 5) to meet the requirements of the statistical test and 
overcome complete separation issues within the sample. Moreover, due to unexpected 
singularities occurring during statistical analysis, the initial feeding type categories (N=5) 
were collapsed into two categories: exclusively breast feeding (EBF) from birth, and all other 
types of combination feeding (combi).  Concurrent with feeding type, the initial feeding 
intention categories were collapsed into two (exclusively breastfeeding, EBF; and any type of 
combination feeding, combi), for the same reason (see Table 4).  Those who intended to 
exclusively formula feed were excluded from the analysis due to statistical issues arising 
from the small number of cases identified (7 cases). For the respect of mothers’ workplace 
and the respect when breastfeeding in public separate binary logit regression models were run 
in order to include only participants who reported paid employment and public breastfeeding 
respectively. 
Results 
Demographics  
The age of the final sample of 679 (80% of the original sample) mothers ranged from 19 to 
45 years (M = 31.21; SD = 4.59).  Their baby’s age ranged from 1 to 26 weeks (M = 16.49; 
SD = 7.62).  The majority of the sample was married or living with their partner (95.8% 
cumulatively) and from the United Kingdom (88.1%).  See Table 2 for full demographic 
details. 
Overall Sample 
From the total sample of 679 mothers, 14.9% experienced feelings of guilt about their choice 
of feeding method. The guilt was motivated from both internal and external sources in equal 
proportions among both feeding type groups (Table 3). Approximately one in three mothers 
 10 
 
(38%) also reported experiencing feelings of stigma about the way they chose to feed their 
baby while more than half of the mothers in the sample (54.5%) reported that they felt the 
need to defend their feeding choices. Interestingly, in all cases where these feelings were 
present, they arise primarily from family members (58.7%, 40.7% and 62.7% respectively), 
with other mothers and peers also making a notable contribution (31.7%, 38.4% and 42.7% 
respectively). However, regardless of the presence of negative experiences, the vast majority 
of the mothers in the sample were satisfied with their choice of feeding method (93.8%) and 
they reported high rates of respect from their everyday environment (80.6%) and when 
breastfeeding in public (71.9%). By contrast, when they were asked about the respect in their 
working environment (or the respect expected upon returning to their employment) mothers 
reported lower levels of respect (56.8%) and higher levels of disrespect (12.8%) than when 
they were asked about the respect from their everyday environment or when breastfeeding in 
public.  
From the whole sample, only 56.6% of the mothers felt well supported by health 
professionals with infant feeding issues. The remainder (43.4%) of the sample reported 
feeling moderately to not at all supported. This finding was congruent with descriptive 
statistics relating to sources of infant feeding information with 42.1% of mothers using the 
internet as their primary resource of information around infant feeding. Here independently 
sourced online forums, social media and scientific evidence were preferred more popular to 
information gained from health professionals.  
Differences in experience by Feeding Type  
Demographic characteristics did not statistically differ between EBF and Combi feeding 
mothers (Table 2). The risk for Combi feeding mothers to experience guilt was almost six 
times higher than EBF mothers (RRR: 0.17 CI: 0.10, 0.27) and largely unaffected after 
 11 
 
adjustments for confounders (RRR: 0.16 CI: 0.09, 0.27) (Table 4). Interestingly, in the two 
groups, the guilt was motivated from different sources [χ2 (2, Ν=101) = 21.30 p<.001] (Table 
3). For EBF mothers feelings of guilt originated more often from the external environment 
(56.8%) than internal feelings (20.5%). However, for half of the Combi feeding mothers 
feelings of guilt could be traced from internal factors rather than external (50.9%). Key 
differences between feeding type were also identified when examining the nature of external 
sources of guilt with EBF mothers reporting they arose from family members more often than 
combi mothers [χ2 (2, Ν=101) = 13.68, p<.001] (Table 2). Internet and social media sources 
display a trend [χ2 (2, N=101) = 3.34, p=.068] for between group differences, with Combi 
feeding mothers reporting these sources of guilt more frequently (Table 3). 
No associations between infant feeding type were observed with regard to stigma (RRR:1.36 
CI:0.82, 2.24) (Table 4). However, when stigma was reported, mothers who EBF were more 
likely to do so as result of breastfeeding in public in comparison to combination feeding 
mothers [χ2 (2, Ν=258)=5.25, p=.022] (Table 3).  
Whilst no associations between infant feeding type and feeling the need to defend feeding 
choices were observed (Table 4, the proportion of mothers reporting defence was high, (51% 
for EBF mothers and 68.1% for combi feeding mothers). When the need for defence was 
reported, only EBF mothers identified the workplace as the source of the feelings. 
Additionally, combi mothers reported a need to defend their feeding choices to themselves 
(question 10.2 table 1) significantly more often than EBF mothers [χ2 (2, Ν=370)=32.56, 
p<.001] (Table 3).  
With regard to the practical experiences of infant feeding, EBF mothers were more likely to 
turn to the internet and social media for advice on infant feeding than combi mothers (RRR: 
0.52 CI:0.29, 0.95), however this association just failed to reach significance in the adjusted 
 12 
 
model (RRR: 0.54 CI:0.29, 1.01) (Table 4). There were also no differences in the perceived 
level of support or respect between groups. However, the sources of support were found to 
differ. EBF mothers reported higher rates of support from health professionals significantly 
more often than their combi peers [χ2 (2, N=679)=8.03, p=.018] (Table 3). A similar pattern 
with even stronger predictive value was identified with regard to satisfaction with the milk 
feeding method ratings. Even though the reported level of satisfaction were quite high in both 
groups, combi mothers  were more frequently dissatisfied or neutral with regard to their 
feeing choice, than their EBF peers (RRR: 3.18 CI:1.17, 8.68) (Table 4). 
Feeding Intention 
For feeding intention, although in the crude model mothers who were planning to combi feed 
were at higher risk of experiencing guilt (RRR: 0.49 CI: 0.26, 0.89), after adjustment for 
feeding type the comparison was no longer significant (RRR: 0.90 CI: 0.47, 1.74) (Table 3). 
Nevertheless, for those who actually reported the presence of guilt, mothers who intended to 
EBF more frequently reported family members as a source of the guilt [χ2 (2, Ν=101)=4.13, 
p=.048] (Table 3).  
Neither of the remaining negative emotions (stigma and need to defend their feeding choices) 
nor any of the practical experiences (sources of information, satisfaction and perceived 
support and respect) examined were found to differ significantly according to feeding 
intention (Table 3 and 4). 
Discussion 
To our knowledge, this large-scale internet study is the first to examine the risk of 
encountering negative emotional and practical feeding experiences in different cohorts of 
breastfeeding mothers. Descriptive findings from the whole sample indicated that mothers 
 13 
 
reported feeling satisfied with their chosen feeding method, respected by their everyday 
environment including when breastfeeding in public and well supported by health 
professionals.  Despite this, overall amongst breastfeeding mothers, 15% reported feeling 
guilty, 38% stigmatised and 54.5% felt the need to defend their feeding choice, with the 
family environment being the most frequent source of those feelings. These findings suggest 
that at surface level, breastfeeding mothers appear to be satisfied, respected and supported but 
on a deeper level, they are still susceptible to negative emotional experiences, particularly 
stigma and defence. Being aware that these emotions occur presents an opportunity to support 
breastfeeding women both emotionally and practically and limit postnatal mood issues, which 
bring potentially deleterious outcomes for both mother and infant. 
Regression analyses identified that mothers supplementing breastfeeding with formula 
(combi) were far more likely to experience guilt, with these associations remaining strong 
after adjustment for confounders. Previous qualitative literature (Knaak, 2010; Marshall et 
al., 2007; K. Williams et al., 2012a) identifies the moralistic nature of the messages currently 
used to promote breastfeeding. The “breast is best” mantra  accompanies the promotion of 
breastfeeding as something that should come natural, is tailored to the baby’s needs and 
provides the best opportunity for bonding and attachment between the mother-infant dyad 
(Williams, Kurz, et al., 2012; Fenwick, Barclay, & Schmied, 2008; Larsen, Hall, & Aagaard, 
2008; Mozingo, Davis, Droppleman, & Merideth, 2000; Murphy, 2000; Williams, Donaghue, 
et al., 2012). Feelings of guilt associated with formula supplementation could therefore arise 
from a sense of inadequacy or failing when compared to this socially constructed ideal 
mother. 
Looking more specifically at the sources of guilt, half of the mothers who use a combination 
feeding method faced internally induced guilt. This is consistent with qualitative research, 
which reports that mothers who decide to offer formula either because their child is not 
 14 
 
thriving, or as an aid for themselves to recover from the physical and emotional challenges of 
breastfeeding, internalize the blame (Tanner and Cockerill, 1996; K. Williams et al., 2012a, 
2012b). On the other hand, with breastfeeding being demanding, meeting maternal 
commitments with other children and managing domestic responsibilities in conjunction with 
social and public life, could produce an array of incompatible expectations from 
breastfeeding mothers. For working mothers, return to their workplace can also contribute to 
the incompatibility of their roles (Stewart-Knox, Gardiner, & Wright, 2003). Those 
expectations, often conflicting by not nature conducive to the establishment of successful 
breastfeeding, could potentially give rise to a source of externally derived guilt when entered 
into the daily life equation. (Hauck & Irurita, 2010).   
Regression analysis also revealed that combi feeding mothers were at a higher risk of 
dissatisfaction from their infant feeding method. With breastfeeding promotion creating a 
perception of formula as an inferior and unsafe substitute of breastmilk that introduces a 
higher health risk for the babies, this is not a surprising finding. Such factors have also been 
linked with greater dissatisfaction with the milk feeding method in qualitative literature 
(Knaak, 2010; Lee, 2007; Murphy, 1999)  and can lead to broader dissatisfaction with the 
mothers’ postnatal experience (Symon et al., 2013). Interestingly, this finding is consistent 
with outcomes from a recent study looking at the emotional and practical experiences of 
exclusively formula feeding mothers (Fallon et al., in submission). This suggests that the 
effect is independent of the amount of formula supplementation and is linked directly to the 
act of formula provision itself. 
In contrast to the initial predictions, neither of these experiences varied according to prenatal 
feeding intention after adjustment for confounders. It is possible that responding to a study 
recruiting breastfeeding mothers fostered internally positive opinions with regard to current 
feeding method and masked any discourse from pre-natal feeding intentions.  However, 
 15 
 
breastfeeding intention is a complex concept and as the present study was not designed to 
assess individual components, such as the strength of feeding intention and plans for feeding 
duration, a complete feeding intention profile could not be generated. 
Although not directly related to the main hypothesis, responses relating to managing 
breastfeeding in public settings and the workplace were included in this study as additional 
variables of importance. While nursing in public may be anticipated to be the most popular 
source of stigmatization in breastfeeding mothers, the vast majority reported that the public 
was moderately to very respectful when they nursed in public. This difference between the 
expected public response, which is expressed as perceived stigmatization, and the actual 
respect by the public has also been reported in a previous study (Sheeshka et al., 2001).  
Negative media reports about public breastfeeding could be contributing to this discourse 
(Boyer, 2011; Taylor and Wallace, 2012). In contrast, stigmatization due to public breast-
feeding was not an issue raised by only a minority of Combi feeding mothers. Mothers who 
are supplementing with formula milk may be less likely to breastfeed in situations where they 
could feel concerned about negative reactions to public breastfeeding, as they have allowed 
the option to offer formula. The working environment was also examined as a specific source 
of negative experiences. Only mothers who EBF indicated they felt the need to defend their 
infant feeding choices in this location. This is to be expected, as EBF mothers are more likely 
to require additional facilities (such as a private room and a fridge to store expressed milk) 
and time in the workplace than Combi feeding mothers (Brown, 2016; Wyatt, 2002). The 
importance of support from employers and co-workers towards the breastfeeding mothers in 
order to successfully continue breastfeeding is highlighted in the literature (Brown, Poag, & 
Kasprzycki, 2001; Johnston & Esposito, 2007; Meek, 2001). More recently the rights of 
breastfeeding mothers were officially established by law (“Equality Act,” 2010, “Pregnancy 
and maternity discrimination,” 2014; Murtagh & Moulton, 2011). However, there are no 
 16 
 
contemporary studies in the UK to demonstrate the efficacy of those provisions, or the 
change of employers’ mind-set or practice towards breastfeeding mothers in the workplace. 
This finding could indicate a less flexible approach by employees when it comes to exclusive 
breastfeeding, however, direct examination of employers’ attitudes towards continuation of 
breastfeeding, when mothers return to work, was beyond the scope of this study. 
This survey is not without its limitations. It was completed by a self-selected sample of 
breastfeeding mothers whose willingness to participate may represent a desire to voice more 
extreme views than those with more neutral experiences who have no perceived benefit from 
taking part. Although efforts were made to advertise the study to the widest possible 
audience, this sample included participants from higher socio-economic status and as such 
cannot be generalised to women from different socio-economic backgrounds.  In addition, the 
retrospective nature of questions relating to feeding intentions may have introduced biases. 
However, the high anonymity that an online study design offers is likely to balance the 
possible biases. Furthermore, the sample size of the study is large enough to engender 
confidence in the accuracy of the resulting summary of emotional and practical experience of 
breastfeeding mothers during the first 6 months postnatally. In addition, the design of the 
survey allowed differentiation of feelings from EBF and combi feeders in terms of both 
feeding intention and feeding type as well as adjustment for established confounders. The 
differences in the proportions between the groups are, in many cases, striking.  
Breastfeeding mothers who did not initially intend to breastfeed were not included in the 
analysis because the sample size was too small, thus creating problems in the logit regression 
analysis. However, looking at the decision making process of these mothers in more detail 
may provide useful insights to motivate mothers who were not planning to breastfeed to 
initiate it in the  postpartum and may help to identify effective support mechanisms that can 
help counteract prior negative beliefs and experiences about breastfeeding.   
 17 
 
In light of the present findings, several recommendations of future research directions can be 
given. While in the present study indications of the sources of guilt undoubtedly arise, future 
research should focus on qualitative identifying the exact reasons mothers feel guilty. This 
cannot only help contextualizing the present findings but can inform health professional 
practices that eliminate the emotional impact on mothers. Of equal importance is a qualitative 
examination of the decision making process and the support network of mothers who were 
intending to formula feed, but exclusively breastfed postnatally. Those mothers were present 
in the initial sample, however they had to be excluded from the analysis due to very low 
numbers (<1% of the sample). This examination can inform effective strategies that can aid 
towards breastfeeding initiation rates among mothers who have not considered breastfeeding 
as an option pre-natally. Additionally, replication of the present study to a targeted sample of 
mothers of lower socioeconomic status is critical to be able to confidently generalize the 
findings to the general population. Finally, as managing EBF continuation upon return to 
workplace was highlighted by EBF mothers as an issue, despite the protective policies in 
place. An evaluation of the implementation of those policies in both privet and public sector 
workplace settings is crucial.  
Future recommendations on breastfeeding promotion policies and campaigns should take into 
account the diverse and multi-factorial needs of different cohorts of breastfeeding mothers in 
order to provide an evidence-based framework of action. Milk feeding practices should not be 
guided by a moral prism or viewed as a moral obligation of the mother to her child. While 
breastfeeding has undoubted health benefits for both mother and child (Kramer, 2008; 
Rosser, 2002), the importance of maternal mental health and wellbeing should not be 
overlooked in promotional efforts as this can have profound implications for maternal and 
infant health and wellbeing (Milgrom et al., 2004; Murray, 1992).

To conclude, this study demonstrates that when breastfeeding mothers fail to adhere to 
exclusive breastfeeding guidelines, they are at risk of encountering negative emotions, 
particularly guilt. Such emotions are likely precursors to more serious postnatal disorders 
with the potential for damaging outcomes for both mother and child. Given that exclusive 
breastfeeding rates are very low in some countries, including the UK, this points to a large 
population whose emotional needs are not represented by current breast-feeding promotion 
practices and infant feeding policies. It is crucial that information provided to mothers is 
balanced and realistically reflects the challenges that exclusive breastfeeding brings. 
Moreover, to enhance the breast-feeding experience and empower mothers with confidence in 
their abilities, promotion and advice must be tailored to individual situations and respect the 
decisions of mothers who choose to supplement with formula.
