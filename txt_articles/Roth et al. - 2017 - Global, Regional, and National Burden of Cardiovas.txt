 ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND The burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains unclear in many regions of the world.
OBJECTIVES The GBD (Global Burden of Disease) 2015 study integrated data on disease incidence, preva-
lence, and mortality to produce consistent, up-to-date estimates for cardiovascular burden.
METHODS CVD mortality was estimated from vital registration and verbal autopsy data. CVD prevalence was
estimated using modeling software and data from health surveys, prospective cohorts, health system admin-
istrative data, and registries. Years lived with disability (YLD) were estimated by multiplying prevalence by
disability weights. Years of life lost (YLL) were estimated by multiplying age-specific CVD deaths by a reference
life expectancy. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita,
educational attainment, and fertility.
RESULTS In 2015, there were an estimated 422.7 million cases of CVD (95% uncertainty interval: 415.53 to
427.87 million cases) and 17.92 million CVD deaths (95% uncertainty interval: 17.59 to 18.28 million CVD
deaths). Declines in the age-standardized CVD death rate occurred between 1990 and 2015 in all high-income
and some middle-income countries. Ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of CVD health lost globally, as
well as in each world region, followed by stroke. As SDI increased beyond 0.25, the highest CVD mortality
shifted from women to men. CVD mortality decreased sharply for both sexes in countries with an SDI >0.75.
CONCLUSIONS CVDs remain a major cause of health loss for all regions of the world. Sociodemographic
change over the past 25 years has been associated with dramatic declines in CVD in regions with very high SDI,
but only a gradual decrease or no change in most regions. Future updates of the GBD study can be used to guide
policymakers who are focused on reducing the overall burden of noncommunicable disease and achieving
specific global health targets for CVD. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;70:1–25) © 2017 The Authors. Published

C
ardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading
cause of death in the world and a major bar-
rier to sustainable human development (1).
In 2011, the United Nations formally recognized non-
communicable diseases, including CVDs, as a major
concern for global health and set out an ambitious
plan to dramatically reduce the effect of these dis-
eases in all regions (2). An increased awareness of
these global noncommunicable disease goals has
expanded attempts to track and benchmark national
efforts at reducing CVD and other noncommunicable
diseases (3,4).
The third Sustainable Development Goal recog-
nized the importance of CVD by targeting a one-third
reduction
in
premature
mortality
due
to
non-
communicable diseases (5). Countries that take the
SDG goals seriously will have to contend with a wide
range of barriers limiting their ability to improve
health care and reduce CVD risks. In many regions of
the world, the relative position of CVD as a health
problem remains unclear or is based on limited data.
Many
low-
and
middle-income
countries
have
implemented health examination surveys that have
improved measurement of CVD and its associated risk
factors (6).
Systematic evaluation of data collected in death
certificates, verbal autopsy, health surveys, prospec-
tive cohort studies, health system administrative
data, and disease registries is needed to appropriately
guide efforts to reduce the health burden of CVD. The
GBD (Global Burden of Disease) study is an effort to
continuously
improve
our
understanding
of
the
burden of diseases by integrating the available data
on disease incidence, prevalence, and mortality to
produce
consistent,
transparent,
and
up-to-date
global, regional, and national estimates (7).
The global number of CVD deaths and regional
patterns of total CVD mortality were previously re-
ported from the GBD 2013 study (8). The GBD 2015
study results provide a completely new mortality
time-series estimated from 1990 forward and updated
through 2015. We now also report national estimates of
mortality to provide results relevant to specific coun-
tries at the level of each underlying CVD condition. In
addition, the study addresses the nonfatal burden of
CVD
by
reporting
global,
regional,
and
national

 estimates of prevalence, years lived with

METHODS
GBD ESTIMATION FRAMEWORK. The Global
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
2015 study is a multinational collaborative
research project with the goal of producing
consistent estimates of health loss due to
over 310 diseases and injuries. A wide range
of data sources and methods were used to
produce age-, sex-, and country-specific re-
sults for the years 1990 to 2015. Results are
updated annually for the entire time series,
and these results supersede previous versions of the
GBD study. Methods have been reported in detail
previously and are summarized here and in the
Online Appendix (9–11).
CHANGES SINCE THE GBD 2013 STUDY. There have
been
numerous
changes
to
data
collection
and
methods in the current study to update and improve
upon the results of the GBD 2013 study. Mortality data
has
been
updated
through
2014
using
newly-
identified data sources released or collected since
GBD 2013. Because of their available vital registration
data, 7 territories have been added: American Samoa,
Bermuda, Greenland, Guam, the Northern Mariana
Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Disease
burden from these territories are now included in the
national totals for the United States, United Kingdom,
and Denmark. A new approach to estimating uncer-
tainty for countries with long (>95% complete) time
series of vital registration data has been used uni-
formly for all CVD causes so that results are not
affected by uncertainty in regions with less complete
vital registration. Models of disease incidence and
prevalence now uniformly include estimates of excess
mortality and, for stroke, cause-specific mortality, so
that they are better informed by the available mor-
tality data. For each incidence or prevalence data
point, we matched the age-sex-location-year-cause–
specific mortality rate to produce a ratio conceptually
equivalent to an excess mortality rate. Because of
implausibly rapid increases in deaths reported due to
atrial fibrillation, we have developed a unified model
of atrial fibrillation that makes use of prevalence, case
fatality, and mortality data to estimate both the
nonfatal and fatal burden due to this condition.
DEFINING
DISEASE
CATEGORIES. CVD
was
esti-
mated overall and separately for the 10 most common
global causes of CVD-related death. These causes
were ischemic heart disease (IHD), ischemic stroke,
hemorrhagic and other stroke, atrial fibrillation, pe-
ripheral arterial disease (PAD), aortic aneurysm, car-
diomyopathy and myocarditis, hypertensive heart
disease, endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease (RHD),
and a category for other CVD conditions. The GBD
cause list is a hierarchical, mutually-exclusive, and
collectively exhaustive list of causes of death. The 3
level
1
GBD
causes
consist
of
communicable,
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders; non-
communicable diseases; and injuries. Level 2 causes
consist of 21 cause groups, such as neoplasms and
CVD. Levels 3 and 4 consist of disaggregated sub-
causes (Online Methods Appendix Table 1).
Cause of death was defined by international stan-
dards governing the reporting of death certificates, in
which a single underlying cause is assigned by a
physician. For
example, IHD
was defined as an
underlying cause of death across International Clas-
sification of Diseases (ICD) revisions (most recently
ICD-10 I20 to I25, ICD-9 410 to 414) (12). The leading
causes included as “other cardiovascular and circu-
latory diseases” were nonrheumatic valvular disor-
ders
and
pulmonary
embolism.
A
proportion
of
deaths that were assigned on death certificates to
nonfatal, undefined, or intermediate causes (e.g.,
cardiac arrest, heart failure, or hypertension) were
redistributed using statistical regression methods or
fixed proportions (9). Redistribution of deaths coded
to heart failure was accomplished using a regression
model that accounted for the variable use of these
codes by age, sex, and location. This approach im-
proves upon methods that either exclude deaths
coded to an intermediate cause or reassign them us-
ing a fixed proportion that ignores variation by age,
sex, or location. Deaths due to unspecified types of
stroke (ICD-10 I64) were distributed using the ratio of
ischemic to hemorrhagic stroke deaths in a country’s
region or, for South Asia, the global ratio, stratified by
age.
A
Bayesian
noise
reduction
algorithm
was
applied to death data to improve estimation of the
underlying mortality rate (see the Online Appendix
for
details).
This
noise
reduction
algorithm
was
adopted to improve upon prior methods in which
0 counts were excluded, an approach that leads to an
upward bias in estimates. Verbal autopsy, a method
in which a standardized interview collects informa-
tion from household members on symptoms preced-
ing death, was included as a data input only for total
CVD, ischemic heart disease, and stroke deaths, and
was excluded for other CVD causes of death.
Disease prevalence was estimated at a more gran-
ular level of specific disease sequelae, using input data
from systematic reviews of the published scientific

 reports, unpublished registry data, and health system
administrative data. A regression equation was used to
adjust data in the direction of the gold-standard case
definition. Detailed nonfatal modeling methods are
included in the Online Appendix. IHD was the sum-
mation of 4 distinct disease sequelae: acute myocar-
dial infarction, chronic stable angina, chronic IHD, and
heart failure due to IHD. Myocardial infarction was
defined according to the Third Universal Definition of
Myocardial Infarction and the case-finding approach
from the MONICA (Multinational MONItoring of trends
and determinants in CArdiovascular disease) studies,
which accounts for out-of-hospital sudden cardiac
death (13,14). Adjustments were made for the advent
of troponin-testing technology for diagnosis of acute
coronary syndromes during the years covered by the
study using meta-analysis of its increased sensitivity
(compared with prior markers) to adjust pre-2000
incidence rates upward by 56%. Stable angina was
defined according to the Rose Angina Questionnaire,
which was adjusted to account for the observed dif-
ferences in survey and administrative data found in
the United States. Cerebrovascular disease relied on
a case definition developed by the World Health
Organization and was estimated separately for 2
subcategories: 1) ischemic stroke; and 2) hemorrhagic
or other nonischemic stroke (15). Stroke data was
adjusted to match our case definition of subtype-
specific first-ever incident events, and was used to
separately estimate acute and chronic stroke. PAD was
defined by an ankle brachial index (ABI) <0.9, and
symptomatic PAD was defined as self-report of clau-
dicatory symptoms among those with ABI <0.9 (16).
Atrial fibrillation was defined by electrocardiogram
and included atrial flutter. The prevalence of symp-
tomatic heart failure was estimated using both health
system administrative and population-based registry
data, and was then attributed to specific underlying
heart failure etiologies (some of which were not CVD).
Hypertensive heart disease was defined as symptom-
atic heart failure due to the direct and long-term ef-
fects of hypertension, with its nonfatal burden derived
from the model of heart failure. Cardiomyopathy was
defined as symptomatic heart failure due to primary
myocardial disease or toxic exposures, such as alcohol,
with its nonfatal burden derived from the model of
heart failure (17). Acute myocarditis was estimated as
an acute and time-limited condition due to myocardial
inflammation
using
health
system
administrative
data. Endocarditis and RHD were defined by their
clinical diagnosis. Estimates of RHD include cases
identified by clinical history and physical examina-
tion, including auscultation or standard echocardio-
graphic criteria for definite disease.
DATA SOURCES AND ANALYTIC METHODS. A map of
data availability for each country are included in
Online Figures 1A and 1B (9). The GBD 2015 study
used country-level surveillance data, verbal autopsy,
vital registration, published and unpublished disease
registries, and published scientific reports. Table 1
summarizes
data
sources
used
to
estimate
CVD
burden. Table 1 also shows the data representative-
ness index for nonfatal estimates, which is the pro-
portion of age-sex-location strata with available data
for nonfatal modeling shown by cause and over time.
Online Methods Appendix Tables 2 and 3 are tables of
all data sources. Data sources for models are also
available online from the Global Health Data Ex-
change (18). National income, metabolic and nutri-
tional risk factors, and other country-level covariates
were estimated from surveys and published system-
atic reviews. Analysis of mortality used Cause of
Death Ensemble modeling (CODEm), an approach that
incorporates country-level covariates, including age-
sex-country-year–specific estimates of CVD risk fac-
tors,
national
income,
and
other
causal
factors
(Online Appendix). CODEm borrows strength across
space, time, and age groups using a variety of geo-
spatial model types, and weighs the results using
tests of out-of-sample predictive validity. Analysis of
disease prevalence used epidemiological state-tran-
sition–based disease modeling software, DisMod-MR,
which accounts for study-level differences in mea-
surement
method
(9).

 integrated to produce consistent estimates of preva-
lence of all geographies in the study (19). Estimates
were considered significantly different if there was no
overlap in their 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). The
cause-specific mortality rate for atrial fibrillation was
also estimated using DisMod because of implausible
increases in the rate when derived only from death
certificates.
Prevalent
cases
of
each
disease’s
sequelae are assigned specific levels of severity based
on the U.S. Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2000 to
2011, a population-based survey with data on func-
tional health that also provides linkage to respondent
medical records. DisMod-MR models were run sepa-
rately by sex, country, and year.
DISABILITY-ADJUSTED
LIFE
YEARS. Disability-
adjusted
life-years
(DALYs)
combine
information
regarding premature death (years of life lost [YLL])
and disability caused by the condition (years lived
with disability [YLD]) to provide a summary mea-
sure of health lost due to that condition. YLL was
calculated
by
multiplying
observed
deaths
for
a
specific age in the year of interest by the age-
specific reference life expectancy estimated using

methods.
The
normative
standard
life
expectancy at birth is 86.59 years, based on the
lowest observed death rates for each 5-year age
group in populations larger than 5 million. YLD was
calculated
by
multiplying
disease
prevalence
(in
number of cases) by a health-state–specific disability
weight
representing
a
degree
of
lost
functional
capacity. A detailed explanation of the process of
disability
weight
estimation
has
been
reported
separately (10,11). Briefly, disability weights were
developed
using
household
surveys
in
multiple
countries that asked members of the general public
to choose between lay descriptions of health states
(20,21). Adjustment was made for comorbidity by
simulating
40,000
individuals
in
each
age-sex-
country-year stratum exposed to the independent
probability of acquiring each condition based on
disease prevalence.
The 95% UIs reported for each estimate used 1,000
samples from the posterior distribution from the
respective step in the modeling process, reported as
the 2.5th and 97.5th values of the distribution. Age
standardization was via the direct method, applying a
global age structure.

 SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC INDEX. Instead of using the
categories of national socioeconomic status developed
for the GBD 2013 study, we have produced a new
continuous measure of sociodemographic status. The
sociodemographic
index
(SDI)
was
estimated
to
examine changes in CVD burden as a function of the
global epidemiological transition (9). Similar to the
method used to compute the human development
index, SDI was calculated for each country or territory
in each year from 1990 to 2015. SDI was the equally-
weighted
geometric
mean
of
income
per
capita,
educational
attainment,
and
total
fertility
rate.
Least
squares
regression
of
death
rates
on
SDI
was
used
with
a
smoothing
spline
and
dummy
variables for outlier regions that skewed fit to capture
the average relationship for each age-sex-cause group.

REGIONAL VARIATION IN CVD. Prevalence. Globally,
there were an estimated 422.7 million prevalent cases
of CVD (95% UI: 415.53 to 427.87 million cases) in 2015
(Table 2). The age-standardized prevalence of CVD
varied significantly by country (Figure 1). Countries
with the lowest age-standardized prevalence in 2015,
all
with

individuals,
included
Singapore,
Japan,

Many countries had no significant change in the
estimated age-standardized prevalence of CVD from
1990 to 2015, often reflecting low data availability
(Online Figures 1B and 2A). A number of countries
showed a significant decline in the age-standardized
prevalence
of
CVD, including the
United
States,
Canada, Western Europe, Brazil, Australia, New Zea-
land, Japan, South Korea, Kenya, Cambodia, Laos,
and India. There was a significant but small (<1%)
increase in the age-standardized prevalence of CVD in
Mexico, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Mongolia.
Deaths. There were 12.59 million deaths (95% UI:
12.38 to 12.80 million deaths) due to CVD in 1990,
increasing to 17.92 million deaths (95% UI: 17.59 to
18.28 million deaths) in 2015. There was broad varia-
tion
in
the
age-standardized
CVD
mortality
rate
among
countries
(Central
Illustration).
Significant
declines in the age-standardized death rate
due
to
CVD
occurred
between
1990
and
2015
in
all
high-income and some middle-income countries, but
no significant changes were detected over this time
period for most of sub-Saharan Africa and multiple
countries in Oceania and Southeast Asia, as well as
Pakistan,
Afghanistan,
Kyrgyzstan,
and
Mongolia
(Online Figure 2B). Bangladesh and the Philippines
had significant increases in the age-standardized
death rate due to CVD.
CVD DEATHS AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION.
When each world region’s age-standardized CVD
death rate for each year from 1990 to 2015 is plotted
against an index of that region’s sociodemographic
status in the same year, distinct patterns of epide-
miological change are observed (Figure 2). Both an
increase in SDI and a decline in cardiovascular mor-
tality occurred in many regions. Despite marked
improvement in SDI, CVD mortality did not decrease
for men in South Asia and for both sexes in much of

 sub-Saharan Africa. A smaller rise and fall were seen
for women in Oceania and men in East Asia. CVD
mortality declined among high-income regions, but
has plateaued in recent years. The lack of further
decline in CVD mortality is particularly notable in
high-income North America, Australasia, Western
Europe, and the Caribbean. The maximum likelihood
estimate relationship between SDI and CVD mortality,
shown as a black line in Figure 2, is a gradual decline
for women as SDI increases, with a more rapid decline
at the highest levels of SDI. For men, CVD mortality
increases as regions move from the lowest to middle
levels of the SDI, with a significant decrease in mor-
tality only observed for Central and Eastern Europe,
high-income regions, and in Central Asia during the
past decade.
The
relationship
between
SDI
and
the
age-
standardized CVD death rate at the global level is
shown in Figure 3. As SDI increases beyond 0.25, the
highest CVD mortality rates shift from women to men.
Cerebrovascular
mortality
rates
begin
to
decline
among women above an SDI of 0.3, although still
increasing for men. IHD and cerebrovascular mortal-
ity rates continue to increase with greater SDI among
men, peaking at an SDI of 0.5 to 0.75 (compared with
0.25 among women). CVD mortality decreases sharply
for both sexes in countries with an SDI >0.75.

 40 years of age, and the prevalence rose steeply with
older age categories (Online Figure 4A). There were
an estimated 10.88 million prevalent cases of IHD
(95% UI: 8.82 to 13.25 million cases) among persons
50 to 54 years of age, which is more than 3-fold the
number of cases for persons 40 to 44 years of age.
The IHD prevalence rose from an estimated 290
cases per 100,000 (95% UI: 255 to 328 cases per
100,000) for those 40 to 44 years of age to 11,203
cases per 100,000 (95% UI: 9,610 to 13,178 cases per
100,000) for those 75 to 79 years of age, declining
slightly for those 80 years of age and over to a rate
of 9,700 cases per 100,000 (95% UI: 8,773 to 10,738
cases per 100,000).
Eastern Europe had the highest estimated age-
standardized prevalence of IHD in 2015 (4,140 cases
per
100,000;
95%
UI:
3,811
to
4,499
cases
per
100,000), followed by Central Asia and then Central
Europe (Online Figure 5A). IHD accounted for almost
one-half of all CVD cases in Central Asia and Eastern
Europe, but a smaller proportion in Central Europe,
where other cardiovascular and circulatory diseases
made up a larger proportion of total cases (Figure 4).

 Africa region, and South Asia all had similar esti-
mated rates of just over 2,000 prevalent cases per
100,000. More than one-quarter of cases in sub-
Saharan Africa were due to other cardiovascular
and circulatory diseases. The lowest estimated age-
standardized prevalence of IHD was in Central sub-
Saharan Africa (622 per 100,000; 95% UI: 578 to 677
per 100,000), with similar low rates estimated in the
southern Latin America and high-income Asia Pacific
regions.
There were an estimated 8.92 million deaths (95%
UI: 8.75 to 9.12 million deaths) due to IHD in 2015,
making IHD the leading cause of death in the world.
The death rate due to IHD rose steeply above age 40

 years, increasing from an estimated 33 deaths per
100,000 (95% UI: 32 to 35 per 100,000) for those 40 to
44 years of age to 1,050 per 100,000 (95% UI: 1,025 to
1,076 per 100,000) by ages 75 to 79 years (Online
Figure 4B). Above 80 years of age, the IHD death rate
was estimated to be more than twice that rate (2,671
per 100,000; 95% UI: 2,600 to 2,738 per 100,000) and
was by far the leading global cause of death.
The estimated age-standardized IHD death rate
was highest in Central Asia (336 per 100,000; 95% UI:
326 to 347 per 100,000) and Eastern Europe (326 per
100,000; 95% UI: 319 to 333 per 100,000), followed by
Oceania, South Asia, and the Middle East/North Africa
(Table 3). These regions, as well as high-income North
America and Latin America, had particularly high
proportions of total CVD deaths that were due to IHD
(Figure 5). The estimated age-standardized IHD death
rate was similar, from 100 to 150 deaths per 100,000,
across a wide range of regions including high-income
North America, Southeast and East Asia, and the
Caribbean. The high-income Asia Pacific region had a
much lower estimated age-standardized IHD death
rate than any other region (45 per 100,000; 95% UI: 44
to 46 per 100,000) (Online Figure 6A).
Stroke. Globally, hemorrhagic and other strokes, and
ischemic strokes were the second- and third-largest
CVD causes of DALYs in 2015, and the 4th- and 13th-
largest overall, respectively. Ischemic stroke DALY
outranked hemorrhagic and other strokes only in
Central and Eastern Europe and high-income North
America. There were an estimated 5.39 million acute
first-ever ischemic strokes (95% UI: 5.02 to 5.73
million), 3.58 million acute first-ever hemorrhagic
and other strokes (95% UI: 3.34 to 3.82 million), and
42.43 million prevalent cases of cerebrovascular dis-
ease (95% UI: 42.07 to 42.77 million) overall in 2015.
The prevalence of stroke began increasing above 40
years of age, reaching the highest rate for any 5-year
age group for those 74 to 79 years of age (4,201
cases
per
100,000;
95%
UI:
4,140
to
4,258
per
100,000), with the rate declining by one-half this
amount among those over 80 years of age.
Oceania was the region with the highest prevalence
of stroke (1,003 per 100,000; 95% UI: 985 to 1,025 per
100,000), followed by Eastern Europe, Central Asia,
and Southeast Asia. The lowest stroke prevalence in
the world, less than one-fifth that of the highest re-
gions, was in Central Latin America (177 per 100,000;
95% UI: 174 to 180 per 100,000). The estimated age-
standardized
prevalence
of
ischemic
stroke
was
greater than that of hemorrhagic stroke in most re-
gions, but was the same for Andean Latin America.
There were 6.33 million deaths due to stroke in
2015 (95% UI: 6.18 to 6.49 million deaths), with 57% of
these stroke deaths due to ischemic stroke. The stroke
mortality rate began rising above 50 years of age,
increasing for each older age group until it reached
1,812 per 100,000 (95% UI: 1,764 to 1,864 per 100,000)
among those over age 80 years.
The estimated stroke age-standardized mortality
rate in 2015 was also greatest in Oceania (191 per
100,000; 95% UI: 148 to 248 per 100,000), followed by
Central sub-Saharan Africa. The lowest estimated
rates were in high-income North America, Austral-
asia, Western Europe, Andean Latin America, high-
income
Asia
Pacific,
Central
Latin
America,
and
southern Latin America. The ischemic stroke death
rate dominated the hemorrhagic stroke death rate in
Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East/North Af-
rica, the Caribbean, and Southern Latin America, with
similar rates found in Western sub-Saharan Africa,
high-income North America, Australasia, South Asia,
and Western Europe.
Hypertensive heart
disease. Hypertensive heart
disease was the fourth-highest ranked CVD cause for
DALYs in 2015 globally; however, it ranked lower in
high-income regions such as Australasia, high-income
Asia Pacific, and Western Europe. There were 6.09
million (95% UI: 5.73 to 6.43 million) prevalent cases
of hypertensive heart disease in 2015. The prevalence
rose continuously for each age group, from 2.0 per
100,000 (95% UI: 1.7 to 2.1 per 100,000) at ages 20 to
24 years until reaching 1,360 per 100,000 (95% UI:
1,248 to 1,502 per 100,000) for those >80 years of age.
The prevalence was highest in Western sub-Saharan
Africa, followed by Central and Eastern sub-Saharan
Africa, tropical Latin America, and the Caribbean.
The lowest rates were estimated for Western and
Eastern Europe.
There were 962,400 deaths (95% UI: 873,600 to
1,024,500 deaths) due to hypertensive heart disease
in 2015. The mortality rate rose for ages >60 years,
peaking at 296 per 100,000 (95% UI: 257 to 315 per
100,000) for age >80 years. Death rates due to hy-
pertensive heart disease followed a similar pattern as
the condition’s prevalence.
Cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathies
and
acute
myocarditis were a higher-ranked cause of CVD DALYs
in the regions of Central and Eastern Europe than in
other world regions. There were an estimated 2.54
million (95% UI: 2.41 to 2.66 million) prevalent cases of
cardiomyopathy and myocarditis in 2015. There was a
slightly higher prevalence among children 1 to 4 years
of age (29 per 100,000; 95% UI: 26 to 32 per 100,000),
which then decreased for older children, increasing
slowly throughout adulthood. A very large increase in
cases of cardiomyopathy and acute myocarditis was
estimated above 80 years of age (628 per 100,000;

 95% UI: 569 to 692 per 100,000), more than 6-fold
higher than for the next youngest age group of 75 to
79 years of age. This condition accounted for a rela-
tively small proportion of CVD cases overall, with the
greatest age-standardized prevalence estimated for
Southern sub-Saharan Africa, followed by tropical
Latin America, high-income North America, and other
regions of sub-Saharan Africa.
There were 353,700 (95% UI: 339,500 to 370,600)
deaths due to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis in
2015. The mortality rate was as high as 47 per 100,000
persons (95% UI: 33 to 59 per 100,000) within the first
week of life. The mortality rate decreased by 5 years
of
age,
and
then
increased
steadily
throughout
adulthood before increasing more than 300% after 80
years of age, to a peak rate of 90 per 100,000 (95% UI:
85 to 94 per 100,000). CVD deaths due to cardiomy-
opathy
and
myocarditis
were
most
common
in
regions with high prevalence, including Southern
sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Latin America.
Aortic
aneurysm. Aortic aneurysm was the fifth
leading cause of CVD DALYs in the high-income Asia
Pacific region, but ranked lower in other world re-
gions. Globally, there were an estimated 168,200
deaths (95% UI: 163,500 to 172,800 deaths) due to
aortic aneurysm in 2015. The age-specific mortality

 rate due to aortic aneurysm rose most quickly after
60 years of age, reaching a peak of 50 per 100,000
(95% UI: 48 to 53 per 100,000) above 80 years of age.
Tropical Latin America had the highest death rate due
to
aortic
aneurysm,
followed
by
Southern
Latin
America, high-income Asia Pacific, Australasia, and
Oceania. Death rates due to aortic aneurysm were
lowest in Western sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia.
Atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation ranked higher
as a CVD cause of DALYs for Western Europe (fifth),
Australasia (sixth), and South Asia (sixth). Globally
there were an estimated 33.3 million (95% UI: 30.0 to
37.2 million) prevalent cases of atrial fibrillation in
2015. The age-specific prevalence of atrial fibrillation
increased steadily for each 5-year age group above 30
years of age, reaching a rate of 5,544 per 100,000
(95% UI: 4,863 to 6,307 per 100,000) above 80 years
of age. Age-standardized prevalence was highest
in high-income North America (1,224 per 100,000;
95% UI: 1,157 to 1,297 per 100,000), followed by
Western and Central Europe.
There were an estimated 195,300 (95% UI: 159,519
to 236,176) deaths due to atrial fibrillation in 2015.
This death rate was almost 5� higher, 116 per 100,000
(95% UI: 90 to 145 per 100,000) above 80 years of age
than below that age. Atrial fibrillation mortality rates

Saharan Africa.
Rheumatic
heart
disease. RHD
was
the
fifth
highest-ranked CVD cause of DALYs for South Asia
and Central Asia and the sixth highest-ranked glob-
ally, although it was among the lowest-ranked causes
in high-income regions. It accounted for substantially
larger proportions of prevalent CVD and mortality in
Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the Carib-
bean, and Central Asia compared with other regions.
Endocarditis. Although
a
relatively
less-common
cause of CVD, endocarditis DALYs were greater in
sub-Saharan Africa compared with other regions.
There were an estimated 115,700 prevalent cases of
endocarditis in 2015 (95% UI: 108,000 to 125,000
cases). There was an increase and then decline in the
mortality rate among children, which peaked among
children 28 days to 1 year of age (0.22 cases per
100,000; 95% UI: 0.18 to 0.26 per 100,000). The
prevalence
rose
quickly
above
60
years
of
age,
reaching 28 per 100,000 (95% UI: 24 to 34 per
100,000) above 80 years of age. The highest preva-
lence of endocarditis was estimated for Oceania, 14
per 100,000 (95% UI: 13 to 15 per 100,000), which was
twice the rate of the next-highest region, Southern

 Latin America. The lowest rates were estimated for
East Asia and Andean Latin America.
There were 84,900 deaths due to endocarditis in
2015. Mortality rates were highest at the extremes of
the age range: 7 per 100,000 (95% UI: 4 to 9 per
100,000) among those in the first week of life; 8 per
100,000 (95% UI: 7 to 9 per 100,000) among those
75 to 79 years of age; and 22 per 100,000 (95% UI 21
to 24 per 100,000) older than 80 years of age.
Age-standardized mortality rates were greatest in
Oceania, 6 per 100,000 (95% UI: 4 to 8 per 100,000),
more than twice that of the next 2 regions, Central
sub-Saharan Africa and Middle East/North Africa.
Peripheral arterial disease. PAD was among the
lowest-ranked CVD cause of DALYs in most world
regions, but accounted for the largest proportion of
cases
of

95% UI: 22 to 26 per 100,000). The Southern sub-

and the Caribbean, whereas the lowest mortality rates
were estimated for Western sub-Saharan Africa, An-
dean Latin America, and Southeast Asia.
DISCUSSION
CVD accounted for one-third of all deaths in 2015, and
there were an estimated 422 million prevalent cases.
The prevalence of CVD varied widely among coun-
tries, and when age-standardized, was declining in
many high-income countries. Our analysis of mor-
tality and sociodemographic change demonstrates a
global disease gradient dominated by atherosclerotic
vascular diseases, such as IHD and stroke, and with
the most rapid decline occurring only at the highest
levels of development. An alarming finding is that
trends in CVD mortality have plateaued and are no
longer declining for high-income regions. Overall,
these
results
demonstrate
the
importance
of
increased investment in prevention and treatment of
CVD for all regions of the world.
It is notable that very high age-standardized death
rates due to CVD were not limited to any single region
of the world, occurring among a subset of countries
throughout Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle
East, South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Oce-
ania. There were also extremely large differences in
estimated country-level age-standardized prevalence
of CVD, ranging from <4,000 to >11,000 prevalent
cases per 100,000 persons in 2015.
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC
TRANSITION. Our
regional
analysis of SDI over time shows that Oceania, Central
and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and high-income
North America have experienced levels of CVD far
higher than would be expected given global patterns of
disease. Over the same time period, tropical Latin
America and the Middle East/North Africa have expe-
rienced steady declines during periods of continuous
socioeconomic development. Western sub-Saharan
Africa and other areas of Latin America have main-
tained levels well below regions with similar SDI
levels. No decline at all is estimated for South and
Southeast Asia. Recent continuous and rapid decline
in CVD mortality remains a phenomenon limited to
only a subset of high-SDI regions. Regional differences
in CVD are likely a result of variation in exposure to
modifiable risk factors, as well as access to effective
health care interventions (24–28).
CHANGES IN THE DECLINE OF CVD MORTALITY. Of
particular
concern
is
that
CVD
age-standardized
mortality shows less decline in the past 5 years than
over the past 25 years. This trend, which is most
obvious for IHD and aortic aneurysm, is observed not
only in high-income countries, but also in Central
Latin America for men. Regions with very high rates
of CVD that have declined rapidly, such as Central
Asia and Eastern Europe, also see moderation in that
decline. Our use of the most recently available mor-
tality data (through 2013 in many high-income coun-
tries) may explain why our findings differ from a
recent analysis of CVD trends (29). Although an
explanation of stagnation in declining CVD mortality
is beyond the scope of this analysis, several possi-
bilities can be considered. Rising rates of obesity may
be increasing CVD risk over a short period of time
(30). Interventions that reduce CVD mortality rates
may have maximally diffused to the population able
to access them, whereas interventions to address
obesity are more challenging to implement. Some
CVD risk factors, in particular air pollution or changes
in average temperature, may account for larger in-
creases of CVD mortality than previously suspected
(31,32). Improving methods for estimating the most
likely future trajectories for CVD is an important area
for further research.
DISCONTINUITIES IN CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY. Any
broad conclusions on the global influence of socio-
economic development must be tempered by the fact
that rapid increases in CVD burden have occurred due
to a diverse and evolving set of health risks. Eco-
nomic crises in Eastern Europe in the 1990s and the
resulting rapid changes in CVD mortality rates have
only
been
partially
described
and
require
more
investigation. There is strong evidence that the haz-
ardous use of alcohol was a major contributor to this
pattern (33,34). South Africa experienced a similar
mortality crisis, peaking around the year 2000 due to
“colliding” epidemics of human immunodeficiency
virus/acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome
and
noncommunicable diseases (35). These striking ex-
amples of abrupt discontinuities in the number of
deaths due to CVD (“fatal discontinuities”) demon-
strate how political and social unrest may lead not
only to outbreaks of communicable disease, but also
to dramatic changes in cardiovascular health. Further
attention is needed to understand how CVD is influ-
enced by and would be best treated during rapid
changes in material living conditions caused by war,
natural disasters, and mass migration from lower to
higher SDI regions. Patterns of CVD during times of
large-scale migration require particular attention,

21
 due to the potential unfavorable effects of immigra-
tion on atherosclerotic risk factors (when moving to
higher-SDI regions) as well as in reducing access to
basic health care (36).
CAUSE-SPECIFIC VARIATION IN THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL
TRANSITION. IHD and stroke mortality rates increase
and then fall as SDI increases, supporting the theory
of an epidemiological transition for CVD (37,38). The
initial increases in IHD and stroke mortality at low
levels of SDI reflect the particularly high mortality
rates estimated for Oceania, tropical Latin America,
and the Middle East/North Africa region in the 1990s.
Almost all other CVD burdens decrease continuously
at higher levels of SDI. Declines in IHD and stroke
mortality lag for men compared with women as SDI
increases. Differences in CVD risk exposures may
explain this differential by sex, such as exposure to
tobacco smoking (39). The decline in stroke mortality
among women at lower levels of SDI ranging from 0.3
to 0.6, driven by trends in South Asia, North Africa/
Middle East, and Oceania, suggests that countries
need not achieve the highest levels of development to
reduce the burden of stroke. Results of the Prospec-
tive Urban Rural Epidemiological study show that
women have lower use of the most common medi-
cations used to treat CVD compared with men, sug-
gesting that this differential outcome is not the result
of
higher
use
of
secondary
medications
among
women (40).
PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE. We estimated that
PAD is the most prevalent cardiovascular condition
globally, although low estimated rates of claudication
and mortality made it a minor contributor to DALYs.
The high prevalence of PAD in comparison to IHD is a
notable finding that may reflect the ease of its diag-
nosis using ABI, compared with more complex diag-
nostic testing required for IHD. Further attention
should be paid to the use of ABI or palpation of foot
pulses as a screening tool for overall vascular risk in
low-income settings (41,42). There is some evidence
that
even
those
with
asymptomatic
PAD
would
benefit significantly from inexpensive medications,
such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
or antiplatelet agents (43,44).
STROKE. We estimated that hemorrhagic and other
stroke accounted for more CVD DALYs than ischemic
stroke globally and for almost all regions. Although
the predominance of hemorrhagic and other strokes
over ischemic subtypes may reflect variable use of
unspecified stroke ICD-10 codes in some regions, this
ranking also results from the predominance of hem-
orrhagic
and
other
stroke
deaths
over
ischemic
stroke deaths for all ages <75 years, even among
high-income countries. Both stroke subtypes share a
common set of modifiable risk factors, suggesting
that public health and health system investments in
their shared risks could reduce overall burden due to
all stroke (45).
The GBD 2015 study offers improved access to its
data sources, research methods, and results. Citations
for all data used in the study can be found via the
publicly available Global Health Data Exchange (18).
The
new
GATHER
(Guidelines
for
Accurate
and
Transparent Health Estimates Reporting) guidelines
for reporting estimates of public health have been
fully implemented (Online Appendix). Intermediate
model results from DisMod and all final results have
been made publicly available using web-based data
visualization tools (46). Finally, software code and
data tables have been posted online and are freely
available for download (47).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. CVD estimates of the GBD 2015
study have several important limitations. Misclassi-
fication bias due to miscoding of death certificates
remains likely (48,49). The GBD study takes several
steps to improve the reliability and comparability of
vital registration data, including redistribution of
garbage codes, but some systematic bias due to
regional patterns in the use of diagnosis codes may
remain. For example, the relatively large number of
deaths coded to cardiomyopathy in Balkan countries
may lead to an underestimate of the true number of
IHD deaths. Many stroke deaths are coded to non–
subtype-specific stroke codes, which, when combined
with lack of access to computed tomography scanners
to aid in the acute management of stroke, adds
additional uncertainty to the breakdown of stroke
into ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes. Uncertainty
regarding stroke subtype is of particular concern in
South Asia, where no subtype-specific mortality data
were found, and the global proportion of ischemic
and hemorrhagic stroke was used instead. The rapid
rise, globally, in death certificates coded to atrial
fibrillation is implausible in the face of cohort data
showing
stable
age-standardized
prevalence
and
case-fatality rates, and led to our adopting a new
natural
history
method
for
estimating
its
global
burden that incorporates this cohort data. Estimation
of the burden of atrial fibrillation is limited by vari-
able coding of this condition as an underlying cause
of death, especially in the setting of stroke, and very
little data on its prevalence in low- and middle-
income countries. Similar increases in PAD may also
reflect changes in coding practice among physicians.
Health data on CVD remains extremely limited for
some regions of the world, such as India and sub-
Roth et al.

 Saharan Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, a much larger
proportion of prevalent cases of CVD were estimated
to come from other cardiovascular and circulatory
diseases. This category
of other
causes includes
pericardial disease, nonrheumatic valvular diseases,
unspecified lymphatic and vascular conditions, and
pulmonary embolism, as well as deaths coded to left
and right heart failure and other nonunderlying or
nonspecific causes of death. Lack of data is 1 reason
why no significant change in prevalence could be
detected in many regions, for example, Western sub-
Saharan Africa. There is only limited data available in
some countries with both high all-cause mortality and
high estimated CVD mortality. For example, esti-
mates of CVD mortality in Afghanistan are based on a
single verbal autopsy survey performed in 2008 that
reported CVD as the cause of 14.4% of all male deaths
and 20.7% of female deaths.
Data on the severity distribution of CVD is also
particularly limited, and future iterations of GBD will
benefit from additional sources from more regions.
Limited data presents a special challenge in India,
where GBD 2015 relied on 3 major sample vital regis-
tration
sources
for
estimating
mortality:
Medical
Certification of Causes of Death, primarily an urban-
area program; the Survey of Causes of Death and
Survey of Causes of Death-Rural; and the Sample
Registration System. The latter source, in particular,
has not been released in detail for specific causes of
CVD. Expanded access to this kind of data in India
and other countries that have invested in sample
death
registration
systems
could
significantly
improve our ability to forecast trends in atheroscle-
rotic vascular diseases.
The GBD study has reported subnational estimates
for a growing number of countries; however, the
current report is limited to country-level estimates
(50–52). There is substantial small-area variation in
CVD burden within countries, and our national esti-
mates represent only an average level for an entire
country. Even these national estimates are important
starting points for improving evidence available to
policymakers.
The GBD study accounts for comorbidity using a
simulation method that assumes an independent
probability of having any disease state. A sensitivity
analysis found that taking dependent and indepen-
dent comorbidity into account changed overall esti-
mated YLDs by a small amount that increased with
age, ranging from 0.6% to 3.4%. Because CVD is more
common at older ages, the assumption of indepen-
dence may have a larger effect on this group of causes.
Unfortunately, data on the full correlation structure of
prevalent CVD conditions remains limited.
GBD includes an estimate of measurement error,
reported as a 95% UI, for each result. Our ability to
detect significant trends over time is limited for those
regions where UIs are wide, as seen on our global map
of change in prevalence over time. Some countries
may have experienced a rise or fall in CVD burden
that we cannot detect because of limited data.
Although inclusion of measurement error is a
strength of the GBD study, nonsampling error has not
been quantified. GBD uses a wide range of validation
methods, but relies on in-sample and out-of-sample
validity testing to guide model selection. Additional
sources of error in the GBD study may include
regional patterns of clinical diagnosis, death code
redistribution, selection of data sources, covariate
selection for selected models, and measurement of
the SDI. For example, measures of wealth, rather
than income per capita, could potentially capture
additional aspects of the epidemiological transition
for
some
countries.
Limited
data
on
PAD
with
increased ABI due to noncompressible arteries may
lead to underestimates of its true burden. The burden
due
to
Chagas
cardiomyopathy
has
not
been
included, but is estimated by the GBD study as a
sequelae of Chagas disease. Chronic kidney disease
and congenital heart disease are also estimated by
the GBD study and have been reported separately.
Overall, the GBD study is most likely to underesti-
mate uncertainty for those geographies where few
data sources are available.
CONCLUSIONS
CVD remain a major cause of premature death and
chronic disability for all regions of the world. IHD and
stroke account for the majority of health lost to CVD.
Sociodemographic change over the past 25 years has
been
associated
with
dramatic
declines
in
age-
standardized rates of CVD mortality in regions with
very high SDI, but only a gradual decrease or no
change at all in most regions. It is concerning that
large reductions in atherosclerotic vascular disease
mortality, a crowning achievement for public health,
are no longer apparent in many world regions, despite
impressive advances in technical capacity for pre-
venting and treating CVD.
The
GBD
study
offers
a
unique
platform
for
tracking rapidly evolving patterns in CVD epidemi-
ology and their relationship to demographic and so-
cioeconomic change. Specific causes of CVD can be
examined
within
the
broader
context
of
global
health. Countries should consider further investment
in CVD surveillance and population-based registries
to
benchmark
their
efforts
toward

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE:
Ischemic heart disease and stroke account for most of
the global burden of cardiovascular disease, but there
is wide regional variation. Improvements in mortality
related to cardiovascular disease appear to be slowing
for regions of the world characterized by a high
sociodemographic index based on per capita income,
educational attainment, and fertility.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Development of
evidence-based public health policies requires
incorporation of comparative health status and
burden of disease estimates between and within
countries.
