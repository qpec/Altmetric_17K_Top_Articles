Abstract
Historical, environmental, and cultural contexts intersect with aging, sexuality, and gender across communities and genera-
tions. My scholarship investigates health and well-being over the life course across marginalized communities, including 
LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) midlife and older adults, native communities experiencing car-
diovascular risk, and families in China living with HIV, in order to balance the realities of unique lives in contemporary 
society. By probing the intersection of age, sexuality, and gender, my analysis is informed by both personal and professional 
experiences. With the death of my partner occurring at a time of profound invisibility and silence before HIV/AIDS, I found 
my life out of sync, experiencing a loss without a name. My life was thrust into a paradox: My relationship was defined by 
a world that refused to recognize it. This essay provides an opportunity for me to weave together how such critical turn-
ing points in my own life helped shape my approach to gerontology and how gerontology has informed my work and life. 
Reflecting on this journey, I illustrate the ways in which historical, structural, environmental, psychosocial, and biological 
factors affect equity, and the health-promoting and adverse pathways to health and well-being across marginalized com-
munities. Although gerontology as a discipline has historically silenced the lives of marginalized older adults, it has much 
to learn from these communities. The growing and increasingly diverse older adult population provides us with unique 
opportunities to better understand both cultural variations and shared experiences in aging over the life course.
Keywords:  Life course, Equity, Gerontology, Sexuality, Gender, History
As a gerontologist, my scholarship focuses on understand-
ing life and aging across differing historical, social, and 
cultural contexts; how marginalization intersects with age, 
sexuality, and gender; and what approaches are most effec-
tive to promote the well-being of people of all ages and 
cultures. Of the many joys and concerns in the lives of older 
adults and the field of aging, I ask myself how these priori-
ties, and the dilemmas they present, have surfaced as my 
primary substantive interests. Over the past 25 years, I have 
investigated health risk and health-promoting pathways in 
aging and well-being across diverse communities, for exam-
ple, working in LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
and queer) aging (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Cook-Daniels, et al., 
2014; Fredriksen-Goldsen, Emlet, et al., 2013), reducing 
cardiovascular risk in native communities (Walters et al., 
2012), and supporting caregiving of older adults and their 
families living with HIV in China (Fredriksen-Goldsen, 
Shiu, et al., 2011; Simoni et al., 2011), a highly stigmatized 
disease within a global context.
This essay provides an opportunity for me to reflect on 
the turning points in my life and how these have informed 
my work over time, especially now that I’m old enough 
to complete my own aging-related surveys. My goal is to 
reflect on the intersection of how gerontology as a flour-
ishing field has influenced my life and how my life has 
informed my work in the field. As a university professor,

 I have a bulging folder, in which over the past several dec-
ades I’ve tucked away reflections, saving tattered clippings 
and thoughts jotted on scraps of paper or a corner torn 
from a napkin; I pulled a few to share here.
Change in Perspective
Life’s turning points unfold within historical and environ-
mental contexts, having the capacity to profoundly alter 
life trajectories. In early gerontological work, Neugarten, 
Moore, and Lowe (1965) theorized social clocks and age-
appropriate expectations, norms, and behaviors related to 
the timing of transitions, as “on-time” or “off-time,” such 
as marriage, childbearing, and widowhood. The off-time 
non-normative life transitions, as unusual occurrences out 
of sequence, have potential to influence life choices. My 
childhood and early adult life was relatively on-time—in 
my early 20s, for example, I worked part-time to pay full-
time college tuition preparing to attend law school.
I had been living with my partner, Diane, for 3 years. 
I was committed, yet there were larger societal constraints 
imposed on our relationship. I will never forget dancing at 
a women’s nightclub, which, typical of the era, had no win-
dows, when a man raised himself from a veiled corner seat, 
crashing a beer bottle across the table edge, swinging the 
remaining ragged shards of glass, threatening our existence. 
This for me reflected the double-bind nature of marginal-
ized lives: visibility and openness creates opportunities, yet 
can result in exposure and vulnerability. Although my life 
was shrouded in a cloak of vulnerability, I resisted in vari-
ous personal and collective ways.
One early morning when I was 24 years, Diane, 27 years, 
woke me in the middle of the night with an excruciating 
headache. By the time the medics arrived, she could no 
longer talk and her breathing was deeply labored; the med-
ics splayed her on the living room floor assessing her for 
signs of life. She was immediately rushed alone to the hos-
pital; I was told to wait patiently at home for their call and 
to not worry, that my “friend” would be fine. Instinctively, 
I knew I needed to be at her side so I made my way to the 
hospital and crept my way through the corridors, despite 
the triage nurse’s poignant instructions to remain in the 
waiting room. I found her in an emergency room, uncon-
scious, half of her head shaven, tubes and electrodes con-
nected. The nurse informed me they were waiting for her 
father, her legally, biologically, and geographically closest 
“relative,” to make a decision about ending life support. 
Stunned by the impending realities, I did not leave her side. 
With her one last breath, I found myself alone, a life out of 
sync—a loss without a name. Within a time of profound 
invisibility and silence, before HIV and AIDS, I immedi-
ately plunged into a tumultuous storm, without guidance, 
cues or models. Suddenly, I had more in common with wid-
ows, most of whom were old, than my peers. Some of those 
closest to me lamented that I was not a widow because 
I had not married; they, too, were trying to make meaning 
of Diane’s death. My life was thrust into a paradox: The 
loss of my closest relationship, defined by a world that 
refused to recognize it.
Reaching Out: Serving 
Those in the Margins
As I grieved Diane’s death, I became acutely aware I had 
been relegated to the margins and rendered invisible; at the 
time, there were no services or supports for lesbians and 
gay men grieving the death of a partner. As a result, my life 
shifted course, and I embarked on a new career and pursued 
a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree at the University 
of Washington. I and three others started Shanti/Seattle in 
1982. The agency was mirrored after the original Shanti, 
meaning “inner peace” in Sanskrit, started in Berkeley in 
1974 by Dr. Charles Garfield (Garfield, Spring, & Ober, 
1995). Shanti/Seattle provided peer support to meet the 
emotional and sociocultural needs of persons with life-
threatening illnesses and those grieving the death of loved 
ones; it was designed to be responsive and serve everyone, 
regardless of age, sexuality, gender, or culture.
One of my first phone calls was from an old woman 
whose life partner, or “liaison” as she termed it, of 50 years 
had just died. She was adamant in her yearning to end her 
life because not another living being knew about their out-
lawed love. I came to understand her profound social iso-
lation; how very alone she could be but never should be. 
Each day we talked; she refused to share her phone number 
or address, just a promise to call back. After a week of shar-
ing her loss with complete desperation, she failed to call. 
I witnessed a history I had not fully understood; still today, 
I have no way of knowing if she took her own life or sur-
vived the intense isolating grief. Through this experience, 
I started to wonder about those much older in our commu-
nities, about the countless yet unseen LGBTQ people my 
grandparent’s age whose lives were laced with invisibility 
and social stigma. These were memorable reflections as a 
budding gerontologist.
Soon death and dying became all too familiar in our 
communities. Shanti was facing a burgeoning threat as 
an impending pandemic was unfolding. Very quickly we 
became overwhelmed trying to meet the mounting needs 
of people with AIDS, and those grieving the loss of part-
ners, multiple friends, and family members. In the early 
80s, I remember going to visit a Shanti client in a large 
public hospital. Suited with sterile medical gown and mask, 
I walked down the endless corridor, room after room full 
of dying men young and old, and every age in between. We 
didn’t know the cause of “gay-related immune deficiency,” 
but I did know countless members of our community were 
dying and desperately needed support. A major public 
health epidemic yet no public response. It became evident 
that the isolating events in my own personal life with the 
death of Diane reflected much broader societal conditions 
of LGBTQ people everywhere. The demise of our com-
munity seemed inevitable without action, so we started

 the AIDS Funding Coalition, which I co-chaired, advocat-
ing for public health resources. Another advocacy group 
of the time, ACT UP, brought the demands to the street. 
I was soon appointed by the Mayor of Seattle to the first 
city-sponsored Gay and Lesbian Task Force. This stretch 
of collective activism taught me that action in the face of 
inhumane isolation can change lives.
Gaining a Foothold in Gerontology
As a cofounder of Shanti/Seattle, I gave my first talk on 
sexual minority aging in the mid-1980s, within the context 
of the AIDS pandemic. The timing of the talk was fitting 
because President Reagan’s administration had proclaimed 
the homosexual party was over. I’m still mad about that 
because I don’t know who had the party and why I wasn’t 
invited. During my studies, when I told a sociology profes-
sor I wanted to study lesbian and gay people who were ill 
or bereaved, I was quietly yet tersely warned not to—that 
such work would harm my career. When I asked other aca-
demics—a few of whom were gay—I was told to avoid this 
work because it was too controversial and impossible to 
receive research support. These early academic experiences 
helped me to understand how fear and repression maintain 
as well as reinforce silence in science and gerontology. Yet, 
these overt warnings did not discourage me, rather they 
framed tremendous possibilities for change.
During this time, the courageous work of several early 
pioneers in the field were questioning commonplace mis-
conceptions of lesbian and gay aging (Fredriksen-Goldsen 
& Muraco, 2010). The prevailing stereotypes portrayed 
“old gays” as depressed and undesirable. The early work 
in the field countered these stereotypes (Berger, 1984; 
Berger & Kelly, 1986, 2002; Gray & Dressel, 1985; 
Quam & Whitford, 1992); through “crisis competence,” 
(Friend, 1980; Kimmel, 1980) and “mastery of crisis” 
(Berger, 1980), it was hypothesized that the management 
of a stigmatized identity (e.g., gay) could result in the posi-
tive management of another identity (e.g., old age), with 
sexual minorities better prepared for aging compared to 
older adults in general (Adelman, 1990; Butler & Hope, 
1999; Kehoe, 1986, 1988; Sharp, 1997). Following the 
early research, more studies also began to explore the criti-
cal support provided by “families-of-choice” in the lives 
of older sexual minorities (Adelman, 1990; Beeler, Rawls, 
Herdt, & Cohler, 1999; de Vries, 2007; Orel, 2004) as well 
as the need for increased access to formal services and legal 
protections (Brotman, Ryan, & Cormier, 2003; Cahill & 
South, 2002; Quam & Whitford, 1992). During this time, 
colleagues and I conducted an agency-based case study of 
Shanti/Seattle, integrating a feminist analysis that under-
scored the pivotal nature of community engagement and 
resistance in creating organizational and cultural change to 
support marginalized communities (Hooyman, Fredriksen, 
& Perlmutter, 1988). I became increasingly interested in 
how historical forces and earlier life experiences influence 
the life span, given the dynamic nature of social interac-
tion and structural location intersecting with time, period, 
and cohort effects over the life course (Bengtson & Allen, 
1993; Elder, 1994, 1998).
At the same time, invisibility reigned as the primary 
barrier to applying such concepts to those living in the 
margins. During my doctoral studies at the University of 
California Berkeley (1989–1993), I worked closely with my 
exceptional mentor, gerontologist Dr. Andrew Scharlach, 
investigating family caregiving over the life span, which 
resulted in my first book Families and work: New direc-
tions in the twenty-first century (Fredriksen & Scharlach, 
2001, Oxford University Press). We examined how care-
giving distress was differentiated by age (Scharlach & 
Fredriksen, 1994), gender (Fredriksen, 1996), employment 
status (Fredriksen & Scharlach, 1997), and race/ethnicity 
(Fredriksen-Goldsen & Farwell, 2004). Yet, when I sought 
to add a question on sexual orientation to a large work-
place survey, I was prohibited at an institutional level 
because some feared it would breach the privacy rights of 
participants. Despite obstacles, I ascertained relationship 
status as well as the gender of both partners and completed 
one of the first caregiving studies of same-sex couples. 
Based on this and other studies, we documented extensive 
care responsibilities among lesbians and gay men, despite 
limited support and access to family caregiving services 
(Fredriksen, 1999). Increasingly, the “B” for bisexual, “T” 
for transgender, and “Q” for queer and questioning were 
added to our community’s awareness and lexicon, which 
expanded the dimensions of my own work addressing ineq-
uities by age, sexuality, and gender.
As my scholarship on the intersection of aging and 
marginalization across social groups intensified, O’Rand’s 
(1996) work, in particular, was illustrative for me in terms 
of the application of a life-course analysis to better under-
stand how heterogeneity and inequality within and across 
social groups and aging cohorts result in cumulative dis-
advantage. The University of Washington, School of Social 
Work, hired me as an Assistant Professor in 1993, and 
I became the first openly identified faculty member in the 
school.
I was soon to receive my first federally funded grant, from 
the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute 
of Mental Health (NIH/NIMH) in 1999, to investigate the 
role of informal and formal supports on the dyadic nature 
of HIV/AIDS caregiving. Based on a resilience framework, 
this study identified several key risk and protective factors 
predictive of mental health among chronically ill sexual 
minorities (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, Muraco, & Mincer, 
2009), laying the groundwork for several future studies. 
During these times, I was cautioned by many to not use 
the words “lesbian, gay, or bisexual” in articles, grant titles, 
or abstracts. From the time I entered my MSW program in 
1984, when I was told I shouldn’t, couldn’t, and wouldn’t 
study LGBTQ aging and health to the time I became an 
Associate Professor in 1999, I was surprised to find, despite

 all the prevailing stereotypes, LGBTQ older adults were 
excited to join our research efforts.
In Sync and On-Time: Growing National 
Interest in LGBTQ Health Disparities
When I asked one of our oldest participants, a 95-year-old 
gay man: “How old were you when you first considered 
yourself gay?” He responded, “15 years old.” When asked, 
“How old were you when you first told someone that you 
were gay?” his answer was, “90 years old.” Social norms 
were changing rapidly with growing interest in sexual ori-
entation and gender identity and in 2009 Aging with Pride: 
National Health, Aging, Sexuality and Gender Study (K. 
I. Fredriksen-Goldsen, Principal Investigator [PI]) was the 
first national study of LGBTQ aging, health, and well-being 
of midlife and older adults, federally funded (R01) by the 
National Institutes of Health and the National Institute 
on Aging (NIH/NIA). In conducting this landmark study, 
we collaborated with 11 community agencies and reached 
2,560 LGBTQ midlife and older adults, enabling us to 
investigate how age, sexuality, and gender intersect with 
risk and protective factors in aging, health, and well-being.
The Institute of Medicine and the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services both released reports in 2011 
recognizing health disparities among LGBTQ people. Yet, 
still today, most public health- and aging-related surveys 
do not include sexual orientation or gender identity meas-
ures. Even when a sexuality question is included, it is often 
only asked of young- and middle-aged adults. Older adults 
have often been excluded from these questions, likely 
anchored in several outdated assumptions, including older 
adults are not sexual, will not understand the questions, 
will not respond, or the questions are “too sensitive.” Yet, 
when we analyzed some of the earliest population-based 
data available, we found more than 2% of older adults 
self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual in a random digit-
dialed telephone survey (Fredriksen-Goldsen & Kim, 2015; 
Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, & Barkan, 2012); in fact, the 
sexual identity question had a higher response rate than 
income. These findings paved the way for us to advocate 
for the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity 
questions in large-scale population-based surveys, includ-
ing the National Health and Retirement Study. Our on-
going work on best practices for measurement of sexuality 
and gender reveals the dynamic, evolving nature of sexual-
ity, gender, and age.
When investigating health disparities, we found that 
lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults, age 50 and older, com-
pared to heterosexuals of similar age, are at an elevated risk 
of functional limitations and mental distress, even when 
controlling for age, income, and education (Fredriksen-
Goldsen, Kim, Barkan, Muraco, & Hoy-Ellis, 2013). We 
also found substantial differences within subgroups in 
these communities. Analyzing national probability-based 
data, we recently documented higher incidence of 9 out 
of 12 common chronic conditions, with disability among 
lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults having earlier onset com-
pared to heterosexual adults (Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2016). 
Transgender older adults report even higher rates of dis-
ability, poor physical health, depression, victimization, and 
discrimination (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Cook-Daniels, et al., 
2014) than nontransgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual older 
adults. Despite using LGBTQ for short hand, this work 
illuminates the heterogeneity within these communities and 
distinct aging and health risks of unique groups, includ-
ing transgender (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Cook-Daniels, et al., 
2014) and bisexual older adults (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Shiu, 
Bryan, Goldsen, & Kim, in press), LGBTQ older adults of 
color (Kim & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2012), those of lower 
socioeconomic status (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, Bryan, 
Shiu, & Emlet, in press), and those who define themselves 
as queer or something else (Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2016).
Health Equity
As the PI of Aging with Pride, we are now conducting the 
first longitudinal study of 2,450 LGBTQ adults 50 and older, 
investigating trajectories in health and aging. Interestingly, as 
we assess disparities, we also find that most LGBTQ older 
adults are enjoying good health, with high satisfaction and 
good quality of life. In fact, LGBTQ older adults’ resilience, 
likely forged from adversity, seems to strengthen their fortitude 
and enhance their well-being (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, Shiu, 
Goldsen, & Emlet, 2015). We also found that among lesbian, 
gay, and bisexual older adults, most report higher levels of 
education and yet comparable or lower incomes (Fredriksen-
Goldsen, Kim, et al. 2013), associated with discrimination in 
the workplace. In addition, nearly 70% experienced verbal 
assault and nearly half were threatened with physical violence 
(Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, et al., 2011). Yet, despite the adver-
sity, or perhaps because of it, we’ve documented countless 
demonstrations of individual and collective agency.
As I continued to unpeel the layers of how marginaliza-
tion intersects with aging and health, neither a resilience 
nor stress framework was sufficiently comprehensive to 
capture the range of positive and negative experiences that 
I encountered. As a result, colleagues and I developed the 
Health Equity Promotion Model (Fredriksen-Goldsen, 
Simoni, et al., 2014), illuminating the importance of reach-
ing full health potential for all ages, generations, and 
backgrounds. This perspective illustrates how the intersec-
tionality of social positions intersects with the larger his-
torical, structural, and cultural context as well as health 
risk and health-promoting psychological, social, behavio-
ral, and biological processes to influence aging, quality of 
life, and both positive and negative health outcomes.
From a generational perspective, the LGBTQ midlife and 
older adults in our longitudinal study include three genera-
tions: the Invisible Generation, the Silenced Generation, and 
the Pride Generation. The Invisible Generation came of age 
during the Great Depression and many fought during World

 War II—a period wherein LGBTQ identities were largely 
absent from public discourse. The Silenced Generation came 
of age during a time when same-sex behavior was severely 
stigmatized and criminalized; the American Psychiatric 
Association’s first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders in 1952 listed homosexuality as 
a sociopathic personality disturbance. LGBTQ older adults 
have shared with me how they were involuntarily commit-
ted to mental institutions and subjected to brutal procedures, 
including castration and lobotomy. Many came of age dur-
ing the backdrop of the McCarthy’s “lavender scare,” when 
a new era was ushered in and sexual and gender minority 
identities not only entered into the popular public discourse 
but also were cast as a threat to the security of the nation 
(Canaday, 2009). LGBTQ midlife adults, like myself, as part 
of the Pride Generation, came of age at a time of transforma-
tive social change reflected in the Stonewall riots in 1969, 
the catalyst for the gay liberation movement. Along with 
the civil rights and women’s movements, and the changing 
landscape as a result of the AIDS pandemic, we witnessed 
the beginning of the decriminalization of same-sex sexual 
behavior and in 1973 the removal of homosexuality as a 
sociopathic personality disturbance from the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Silverstein, 2009).
Although many resisted and profound strengths were 
evident across the generations, we observed unique con-
figurations of risks and resilience within each cohort. I also 
began observing a “breaking point” when too much adver-
sity seemed to result in vulnerability and deleterious conse-
quences across the generations of LGBTQ older adults. We 
are using these findings to promote early identification of 
those most at-risk. Across several studies, we found some 
of the greatest strengths of LGBTQ older adults include 
their fierce independence and reliance on deep personal 
relationships built on commitment and care. Most LGBTQ 
older adults rely heavily on their friends and age-based 
peers for support, which is an important source of strength 
in these communities (Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2016). Yet, the 
availability of such support may have limits, particularly 
in advanced age when peers may experience their own 
potential health and mobility problems. The heightened 
probability of premature mortality looms over these his-
torically disadvantaged communities (Fredriksen-Goldsen, 
2016; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014). For these reasons, I’m 
especially concerned about LGBTQ older adults who are 
most frail and vulnerable, and the long-term survivors, who 
outlive their peers. These older adults, I believe, have few 
opportunities to feel safe and to be themselves and are at 
elevated risk of social isolation and suicide. LGBTQ older 
adults themselves fear having to return to the closet at the 
time they are most vulnerable and need the most support.
Where Do We Go From Here?
Although my professional life seems to be relatively on-
time, at least for now, some key transitions in my personal 
life remain somewhat off-time, to which I have become well 
accustomed. With Neugarten and colleagues’ (1965) social 
clocks and the timing of transitions—marriage, child-
bearing, then widowhood—my social clock was reversed: 
widowhood, childbearing, then marriage. After a 31-year 
engagement and the birth of two children, my partner and 
I were legally married 3 years ago. Up until the time of fed-
erally recognized legal marriage across the nation, I punned 
that it wasn’t if we could get married, but how many times 
we had to get married. We acquired differing legal docu-
ments given our changing geographic locations and shift-
ing legal statuses, including domestic partnerships in 1989 
and 1994, and marriage licenses in 2005 and 2012. That’s 
a change in legal status, accompanied by one more reason 
to celebrate, each and every decade. Our two children (now 
young adults attending college) and their friends always 
considered us married like the other coupled parents around 
the soccer fields. Our research shows the same positive 
social and health benefits of partnership status for same-sex 
couples (Goldsen, Bryan, Muraco, Kim, Jen, & Fredriksen-
Goldsen, in press; Williams & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2014) 
as compared to those in different-sex couples. Yet, as a con-
firmation of the double bind nature of marginalized lives, 
the legally married same-sex partners are more likely to 
openly disclose and experience higher levels of everyday 
bias than the unmarried same-sex partners.
About half of the study participants are partnered; 
among those that are partnered, only half are legally mar-
ried. Furthermore, many experienced the death of a partner 
when legal marriage and access to federal benefits did not 
exist. We now have a chasm dividing experiences by gen-
erations: those with access to spousal benefits and those 
that never did nor never will have access to such support. 
It is important to consider the consequences of prior social 
and legal exclusion as they relate to life events (i.e., mar-
riage) and acquisition of social roles (i.e., legally recognized 
spouse).
I am often asked, “Don’t LGBTQ people age like every-
one else?” I respond from both personal and professional 
perspectives, “Yes—in countless ways we do age the same, 
but at the same time we must understand the historical, 
social and cultural realities in contemporary society on real 
lives.” When working in any marginalized community, I feel 
a distinct responsibility to surface, and be responsive to, 
the real issues and problems that exist in communities and 
yet at the same time to ensure that existing strengths and 
resources are considered. When working in marginalized 
communities, how can we raise tough issues without sim-
ply reinforcing stereotypes—interpreted as representative 
of a community? How can we, as gerontologists, under-
stand common trends yet simultaneously attend to the vast 
range of experiences in any community?
My goal in this work has always been to surface and 
understand both the commonalities and distinct strengths 
and challenges facing these communities and to consider 
how individual choices and individual agency as well as

 collective action influence the ways in which people live 
and age. The longitudinal study Aging with Pride allows us 
to distinguish LGBTQ older adults at most risk of adverse 
health outcomes and to better understand those aging well. 
The next step is to ensure the use of the information to 
generate new solutions to old problems through evidence-
based interventions and programs as well as prevention 
(Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2016). For example, Generations 
with Pride (http://caringandaging.org/wordpress/genera-
tions-with-pride-about/) is a nonprofit organization we 
initiated to develop and test evidence-based interventions 
to reduce isolation and enhance optimal aging as LGBTQ 
older adults age-in-community.
As I ponder where this field is headed, both locally and 
globally—I reflect upon the countless lives I have witnessed 
and the symbols of differing histories and cultures as they 
unfold. A participant in one of our studies lamented “labels 
are for cans,” whereas others cling to the comfort of lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer or homosexual or their 
“liaisons.” And there is the next generation who poignantly 
remind me that “LGBTQ” is becoming outdated so we 
must continue to investigate ways to incorporate a greater 
range of emerging identities and experiences into research. 
I’ve been told by some that increasing acceptance will alle-
viate the need for such terms. Yet, there are the emerging 
scholars who still share with me that they have been told 
by mentors to not risk their careers by conducting research 
with sexual and gender minorities or other marginalized 
communities. Many of our participants have never iden-
tified as LGBTQ to anyone yet have taken a risk to par-
ticipate in our studies. When asked in interviews why they 
participated, they most often responded that they want to 
create a legacy—a better world now and for future genera-
tions. They, like so many others, want their lives to have 
meaning by making a difference.
Conclusion
If I leave a legacy, I hope my work, and that of others, will 
shed light on the diverse and unique life experiences and 
aging of those who have been relegated to the margins. To 
retain diversity of experience is to move the field of aging 
forward. Recently, I found myself pondering, how can his-
torically disadvantaged groups shift from the margins but 
not to the mainstream? Indebted to the richness of the field 
of gerontology, I do contemplate my own aging. When 
I embarked on my career, my parents and grandparents 
were engaged in my life, and now, I, as the oldest genera-
tion, share past stories and create new ones for the two new 
generations of my family. Today is tomorrow—I believe 
what we do today creates the conditions of tomorrow.
Although gerontology as a discipline has historically 
silenced the lives of LGBTQ older adults and the intersec-
tion of age, sexuality, and gender, as a field, it has much 
to learn from these older adults and their kin as well as 
those in other historically disadvantaged communities. 
Interestingly, the lives of LGBTQ older adults mirror many 
of the changing and growing societal and demographic 
trends, including smaller families, and increasing numbers 
of older adults cohabitating, never marrying, not having 
children, and living at a distance from family members. The 
margins provide critical lessons such as these for the field of 
gerontology. The diverse older adult populations in which 
I work provide me with rich opportunities to better under-
stand how my own personal experiences intersect with the 
historical, cultural, and social context as they contribute 
to cultural variations and shared experiences of aging. 
Gerontology, as a dynamic area of scholarship, has always 
demanded of me an openness to new realities and possibili-
ties. A cornerstone of life, to me, as a human being, mother, 
spouse, friend, and gerontologist, is to have the courage to 
uncover what others fear to encounter.
