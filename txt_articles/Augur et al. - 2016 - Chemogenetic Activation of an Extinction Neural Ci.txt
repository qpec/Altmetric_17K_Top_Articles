The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been shown to negatively regulate cocaine-seeking behavior, but the precise conditions
by which vmPFC activity can be exploited to reduce cocaine relapse are currently unknown. We used viral-mediated gene transfer of

to the medial nucleus accumbens shell, confirming that these neurons are responsible for the decreased cue-induced reinstatement of

Introduction
Cocaine addiction is characterized by episodes of recurrent re-
lapse, which is often triggered by environmental reminder cues
associated with the drug experience (Pickens et al., 2011; Sinha,
2013). Animal models have implicated the medial prefrontal cor-
tex (mPFC) as a critical structure for regulating relapse (Kalivas,
2008). A dorsal-ventral distinction exists within the mPFC
wherein dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) regions pro-
mote relapse and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) re-
gions promote extinction-like reductions in cocaine seeking
(Peters et al., 2009; Moorman et al., 2015). These bidirectional
effects on cocaine-seeking behavior are mediated, at least in part,
via anatomically distinct projections to the nucleus accumbens,
which integrates information from limbic structures to regulate
motivated behaviors (Sesack et al., 1989; Berendse et al., 1992).
Thus, treatments that alter activity in these neural pathways may
disrupt the propensity to relapse.
Most of the evidence supporting this dichotomy of function
within mPFC stems from deactivation studies, wherein mPFC
activity is reduced or eliminated, for example, through local
pharmacology or focal lesions (Weissenborn et al., 1997; McFar-
land and Kalivas, 2001; McLaughlin and See, 2003; Peters et al.,
2008). In these studies, deactivation of dmPFC reduces relapse
triggered by both conditioned stimuli (CS, e.g., cocaine-
associated cues) and unconditioned stimuli (US, e.g., cocaine)

Significance Statement
The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) projection to the nucleus accumbens shell is important for extinction of cocaine
seeking, but its anatomical proximity to the relapse-promoting projection from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex to the nucleus
accumbens core makes it difficult to selectively enhance neuronal activity in one pathway or the other using traditional pharma-
cotherapy (e.g., systemically administered drugs). Viral-mediated gene delivery of an activating Gq-DREADD to vmPFC and/or
vmPFCprojectionstothenucleusaccumbensshellallowsthechemogeneticexploitationofthisextinctionneuralcircuittoreduce
cocaine seeking and was particularly effective against relapse triggered by cocaine reminder cues.

 et al., 2008). By contrast, deactivating vmPFC under the same
circumstances elicits no effect (McFarland and Kalivas, 2001;
Capriles et al., 2003). Rather, deactivation of vmPFC is sufficient
to induce relapse to cocaine seeking (for heroin seeking, see Pe-
ters et al., 2008; Bossert et al., 2011, 2012; for drug differences, see
review by Peters et al., 2013). Some evidence suggests that these
roles are established over the course of protracted withdrawal
from cocaine, in part through neuroadaptations at mPFC syn-
apses onto nucleus accumbens neurons (Ma et al., 2014). An-
other factor that may be critical in establishing the vmPFC as an
inhibitor of cocaine seeking is extinction training, as at least one
study suggests that the vmPFC may drive the incubation of co-
caine seeking after abstinence (Koya et al., 2009).
Extinction refers to a process whereby CS are learned to no
longer be associated with the US. This may partly involve degra-
dation of the original associative memory but also involves new
learning about the changing contingency between the CS and the
US (Bouton, 2002, 2006; Dunsmoor et al., 2015). The vmPFC in
particular has been noted for its involvement in extinction mem-
ory, not just for cocaine-associated memories, but also for con-
ditioned fear (Peters et al., 2009). Optogenetic activation of
vmPFC neurons during extinction training facilitates subsequent
extinction memory retrieval for both cocaine and fear memories
(Van den Oever et al., 2013; Do-Monte et al., 2015). Local phar-
macological activation of vmPFC (with AMPA receptor agonists)
also enhances extinction memory consolidation and reduces re-
instatement (i.e., relapse) of cocaine seeking (Peters et al., 2008;
LaLumiere et al., 2010, 2012). Extinction training has had limited
clinical success in substance abusers (Nic Dhonnchadha and
Kantak, 2011), but when successful, has been associated with
memory mechanisms in vmPFC (Xue et al., 2012). Treatments
that enhance vmPFC activity may thus be useful pharmacological
adjuncts to behavioral therapy.
The present studies were designed to examine the therapeutic
potential of vmPFC-designer receptors exclusively activated by
designer drugs (DREADDs) on cocaine seeking in an animal
model of cocaine self-administration and relapse. We focused on
the Gq-DREADD (hM3Dq) as a means of activating vmPFC neu-
rons to promote extinction and reduce reinstatement. The Gq-
DREADD has been shown to depolarize neurons through Gq
signaling and subsequent release of calcium from internal stores
(Armbruster et al., 2007; Alexander et al., 2009). This in turn
promotes neuronal burst firing, and vmPFC-neuron bursting is
associated with enhanced extinction memory retrieval (Burgos-
Robles et al., 2007). Thus, we hypothesized that the vmPFC-Gq-
DREADD would promote extinction memory retrieval and
reduce cocaine seeking.
Materials and Methods
Subjects. Male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories; #Crl:
CD(SD), RRID:RGD_734476) weighing 250–300 g on arrival were indi-
vidually housed in a temperature and humidity controlled environment
with a 12 h light/dark cycle (6:00 A.M. lights off). Experiments were
conducted during the rats’ dark cycle. Rats were mildly food-restricted to
20–25 g of food per day to promote behavioral performance. Water was
available ad libitum in the home cage.
Drugs. Cocaine hydrochloride and clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) were
obtained through the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Supply
Program. Cocaine was dissolved in saline, and CNO was dissolved in 5%
DMSO � 95% saline. CNO was administered at a dose of 10 mg/ml/kg
(i.p.) based on reports indicating that this may be a minimal effective
dose in some systems (Li et al., 2013; Chiarlone et al., 2014; Mahler et al.,
2014). A pretreatment interval of 1 h was used based on the prolonged
pharmacokinetics of CNO-induced behavioral and neurophysiological
effects (Alexander et al., 2009).
Surgery. Surgery was performed under ketamine/xylazine (100/6.7
mg/kg) anesthesia, and ketorolac (15 mg/kg) was administered for anal-
gesia. Rats were implanted with intravenous catheters and bilateral intra-
cranial cannula directed at the vmPFC or the vmPFC and nucleus
accumbens shell (NAshell). Cannulae were used to guide subsequent
microinjections of DREADD vectors into these targets. Stereotaxic coor-
dinates for the vmPFC were 2.9 mm anterior–posterior, �0.6 mm me-
diolateral, and �2.5 mm dorsoventral. Stereotaxic coordinates for the
NAshell were 1.4 mm anterior–posterior, �0.8 mm mediolateral, and
�6.0 mm dorsoventral. Injectors extended 3 mm beyond cannula for
vmPFC and 2 mm for NAshell. Rats recovered for 5–10 d before initiating
behavioral procedures.
Cocaine self-administration. All rats were trained to self-administer
cocaine by pressing the active lever, which delivered a cocaine infusion
(0.31 mg/86 �l/5 s) on an FR1–20 s schedule of reinforcement (20 s
timeout). A cue light (5 s) above the active lever and tone (4 kHz, 78 dB,
5 s) was paired with each cocaine infusion. This cue was used as a re-
minder to trigger reinstatement at a later stage. Pressing on the inactive
lever never produced any consequences. Self-administration sessions
lasted 2 h and were conducted 5–6 d/week for a total of 12–14 sessions. At
the start of the study, we conducted a single food-training session before
cocaine training to facilitate acquisition and maintain consistency with
our previous work (Peters et al., 2008). We also found that withholding
the inactive lever for the first two or three sessions of self-administration
similarly accelerated acquisition; thus, we adopted the latter procedure
for the remainder of the study.
Virus microinjection. The Gq-DREADD (AAV2-hSyn-HA-hM3D(Gq)-
IRES mCitrine, Bryan Roth, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC)
was microinjected into vmPFC (5.1–6.1 � 1012 viral genomes, vg/ml; 0.5
�l/side at 0.1 �l/min) 2 d after the last cocaine self-administration session.
We allowed 26 d for Gq-DREADD expression to accumulate before CNO

versity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC; 6.2 � 1012 vg/ml; 0.5 �l/side at
0.1 �l/min). All viral microinfusions were administered under brief isoflu-
rane anesthesia through chronic indwelling cannula. This entailed �5 min
of anesthesia induction in a vapor chamber, followed by 5–10 min of micro-
infusionandanadditional10mintoallowtheinjectedvirustodiffusebefore
removal of the microinjectors.
Abstinence versus extinction. During abstinence, rats remained in the
home cage, and no behavior sessions or cocaine exposure occurred. Rats
were weighed and handled every few days. Extinction training, wherein
responding on both levers was without consequence, was conducted over
10 sessions each weekday in 1 h sessions.
Cue-induced reinstatement testing. After extinction or abstinence, rats
were pretreated with vehicle or CNO and placed in behavioral chambers
for a cue-induced reinstatement test (28 d after the last cocaine self-
administration session). A single noncontingent presentation of the
light-tone cue (paired with cocaine during self-administration) was de-
livered at the start of the session as a reminder to trigger reinstatement.
During this 1 h test session, responding on the active lever resulted in the
light-tone cue (FR1–20 s), but not cocaine.
Cocaine-primed reinstatement test. Rats continued running on the
same program used for cue-induced reinstatement in daily 1 h sessions
until they extinguished the cocaine cues (�30 active lever presses over 2
consecutive sessions). On the test day, rats were pretreated with vehicle
or CNO and administered a noncontingent injection of cocaine (10 mg/
ml/kg, i.p.) immediately before placement in the test chamber. The
session parameters were otherwise the same as the cue-induced reinstate-
ment test. Testing was conducted in a within-subjects fashion over 2 tests

 with at least 2 d of intermittent cue extinction
sessions to reestablish a baseline.
Immunohistochemistry and Fos quantifica-
tion. At the end of the experiment, rats were
transcardially perfused with 10% buffered for-
malin, and brains were removed for subse-
quent immunohistochemistry on free-floating
(40 �m) sections. Tissue was treated with per-
oxidase, then blocked with 2% normal donkey
serum in PBS. Sections were incubated over-
night at 4°C in primary antibody: mouse anti-

Millipore #ABE457). Secondary antibodies
were biotin-SP conjugated donkey anti-mouse
IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, or anti-chicken IgY (all
1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The signal was amplified
with an avidin-biotin complex (1:500), then reacted with diaminobenzi-
dine (in 5% nickel). Tissue was mounted onto slides, dehydrated, cover-
slipped, and examined under a microscope to visualize Gq-DREADD,
ChR2, or Fos expression. Subjects were eliminated from the final dataset
if no DREADD expression was visible in vmPFC, or if there was substan-
tial spread into dmPFC, as specified in Results. For Fos quantification,
vmPFC sections were imaged under a 10� objective on an Olympus
BX61 microscope using a DVC camera and Stereo Investigator software
(MBF Bioscience). Fos-positive (Fos �) nuclei were counted in 3 or 4
sections bilaterally from vmPFC of each animal. Counting was auto-
mated using a set threshold for detection in ImageJ software (National
Institutes of Health).
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using t tests, paired or unpaired
as appropriate. A Welch’s correction was used if the variances in the two
groups were unequal. Statistical significance was set at an � level of 0.05.
Subjects were eliminated from the final dataset if their data deviated from
the average by �2 SDs, as specified below in Results.

Chemogenetic activation of vmPFC reduces cue-induced
reinstatement of cocaine seeking after extinction
Rats (n � 24) underwent cocaine self-administration and re-
ceived infusions of AAV-hSyn-hM3Dq into vmPFC 2 d after
their last session. Extinction training began after 14 d of absti-
nence, and rats gradually reduced responding on the active lever
over 10 daily sessions. The next day, they were tested for cue-
induced reinstatement after pretreatment with vehicle (n � 11)
or CNO (n � 9; 10 mg/kg, i.p.; 1 h prior). CNO significantly
reduced cue-induced reinstatement of active lever responding
(t(18) � 2.168, p � 0.044) (Fig. 1A). No effects were observed on
the inactive lever (t(18) � 0.812, p � 0.427, vehicle � 8 � 2,
CNO � 11 � 3). One rat in the CNO group was a statistical
outlier and was eliminated. Importantly, treatment groups did
not differ in their average lever pressing at the end of self-
administration (Active lever: t(18) � 0.333, p � 0.743, vehicle �
42 � 9, CNO � 38 � 8; Inactive lever: t(18) � 0.917, p � 0.371,
vehicle � 2 � 2, CNO � 1 � 0) or their total cocaine intake over
the course of self-administration (t(18) � 0.360, p � 0.723, vehi-
cle � 328 � 49 mg/kg, CNO � 301 � 57 mg/kg).
After extinguishing responding for the cocaine-associated
cues, a subset of these rats (n � 16) was tested for cocaine-primed
reinstatement after pretreatment with vehicle or CNO. Each rat
received one test with vehicle, and one with CNO, in a random-
ized order. CNO did not alter cocaine-primed reinstatement (Ac-
tive lever: t(12) � 0.624, p � 0.545, Inactive lever: t(12) � 1.000,
p � 0.337) (Fig. 1A). Histological analysis revealed expression of
the hM3Dq DREADD was centralized in the infralimbic cortex
for most animals (Fig. 1B). Three rats were eliminated: two were
lacking DREADD expression, and one had substantial expres-
sion in dmPFC. In sum, DREADD activation of vmPFC spe-
cifically reduced cocaine seeking triggered by cocaine cues.
We next asked whether extinction training was required for
vmPFC activation to effectively reduce cocaine seeking. Hence,
we repeated the previous experiment but eliminated the extinc-
tion phase. Instead, animals (n � 16) remained in their home
cage during the equivalent time frame. Chemogenetic activation
of vmPFC did not reduce cocaine seeking in these animals (Active
lever: t(12) � 0.180, p � 0.860; Inactive lever: t(12) � 0.156, p �
0.879) (Fig. 2A), even though expression of the Gq-DREADD in
vmPFC (Fig. 2B) was similar to the previous cohort. One animal
was eliminated due to a lack of DREADD expression, as well as
one statistical outlier in the vehicle group. Treatment groups did
not differ in their average lever pressing at the end of self-
administration (Active lever: t(12) � 0.564, p � 0.583, vehicle �
37 � 5, CNO � 33 � 4; Inactive lever: t(12) � 0.745, p � 0.471,
vehicle � 1 � 1, CNO � 2 � 1) or their total cocaine intake over
the course of self-administration (t(12) � 0.389, p � 0.704, vehi-
cle � 260 � 16 mg/kg, CNO � 249 � 23 mg/kg). The relapse-
reducing effects of vmPFC activation thus may depend on

 extinction-induced plasticity, either within vmPFC or in down-
stream structures (e.g., the NAshell).
Selective activation of vmPFC projections to the NAshell
reduces cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking
As previous data implicated the NAshell as an important vmPFC
efferent target responsible for extinction expression, we sought to
determine whether NAshell-projecting vmPFC neurons mediate
the effects of the Gq-DREADD on cue-induced cocaine seeking.
We chose a retro-DREADD approach to selectively express the
Gq-DREADD in these neurons (Fig. 3A) (Boender et al., 2014;
Kerstetter et al., 2016; Marchant et al., 2016). The retrograde-
traveling CAV2-Cre virus was infused into NAshell, and a
Cre-dependent AAV-DIO-hM3Dq into vmPFC. Experimental
parameters were otherwise similar to our initial experiment with
extinction-trained animals for this cohort (n � 19). One rat failed
to acquire cocaine self-administration and was eliminated before
testing. One vehicle rat was eliminated as a statistical outlier on
the test. CNO pretreatment before cue-induced reinstatement
testing significantly reduced cocaine seeking on the active (t(13) �
2.902, p � 0.012), but not inactive (t(13) � 0.030, p � 0.976), lever
(Fig. 3B). An additional control group (n � 8) received a Cre-
dependent channel rhodopsin (AAV-DIO-ChR2) into vmPFC
instead of the DIO-hM3Dq, and CNO pretreatment did not alter
cue-induced reinstatement in these animals (t(12) � 0.061,
p � 0.952, 88 � 15 active lever presses compared with vehicle �
89 � 14; t(12) � 0.036, p � 0.972, 10 � 2 inactive lever presses
compared with vehicle � 10 � 4). Average lever pressing at the
end of self-administration was equivalent between groups (Ac-
tive lever: t(13) � 0.199, p � 0.845, vehicle � 27 � 2, CNO � 26 �
2, t(13) � 0.677, p � 0.510; Inactive lever: vehicle � 0 � 0, CNO �
0 � 0), as was total cocaine intake over the course of self-
administration (t(13) � 0.417, p � 0.683, vehicle � 213 � 19
mg/kg, CNO � 225 � 20 mg/kg).
As before, cocaine-primed reinstatement was not affected by
CNO pretreatment (Active lever: t(14) � 1.631, p � 0.125; Inac-
tive lever: t(14) � 1.708, p � 0.110) (Fig. 3B). Histological analysis
confirmed that expression of the floxed Gq-DREADD was ex-
pressed in the vmPFC-NAshell pathway (Fig. 3A). Three rats
were eliminated from the final dataset: one lacking DREADD
expression and two with off-target expression. At the end of this
experiment, we administered a final dose of CNO (or vehicle) to
verify CNO’s ability to activate vmPFC-NAshell projection neu-
rons. As expected, CNO induced Fos expression within vmPFC
(Welch’s corrected t(8.63) � 2.024, p � 0.038) (Fig. 3C). Thus,
chemogenetic vmPFC activation reduces cue-induced reinstate-
ment of cocaine seeking via neurons that project to the NAshell.
As the effects of vmPFC-NAshell activation with the Gq-
DREADD appeared relatively more efficacious compared with
the global activation of vmPFC outputs with the non-Cre-
dependent DREADD, we asked whether activation of NAshell-
projecting vmPFC neurons would reduce cocaine seeking
after abstinence. Thus, we repeated this experiment, replacing
extinction with home cage abstinence (n � 16). Chemogenetic
activation of NAshell-projecting vmPFC neurons did not reduce
cocaine seeking under these conditions (Active lever: t(12) �
0.195, p � 0.849; Inactive lever: t(12) � 1.051, p � 0.314)
(Fig. 4A). As with previous cohorts, expression of the Gq-
DREADD was primarily localized to vmPFC (Fig. 4B). Two rats
were eliminated: one for lack of DREADD expression and an-

of self-administration was equivalent between groups (Active le-

(t(12) � 0.410, p � 0.690, vehicle � 337 � 31 mg/kg, CNO �

tion also depend on extinction training and its associated
neuroplasticity.
Discussion
ThepresentfindingssupportthefeasibilityofDREADD-basedther-
apyforthetreatmentofcocaineaddiction.Chemogeneticactivation
of the vmPFC using the Gq-DREADD effectively reduced reinstate-
ment of cocaine seeking triggered by cocaine-associated cues. This
effect was only present when prior extinction training was con-
ducted, indicating that extinction-induced plasticity is required for
vmPFC activation to reduce cocaine seeking. Restricting the Gq-
DREADD to NAshell-projecting vmPFC neurons was sufficient to
recapitulate the reduction in relapse. These data underscore the
importance of the vmPFC-NAshell circuit for extinction-induced
behavioral inhibition, particularly in the presence of cocaine-
associated cues that trigger relapse.
There are many factors that may explain the apparent inability
of vmPFC chemogenetic activation to reduce cocaine seeking
after abstinence. The neural circuitry regulating cocaine seeking
after abstinence may not require the prefrontal cortex; rather, the
dorsolateral caudate-putamen appears to be a critical regulator of
this form of relapse (Fuchs et al., 2006). Indeed, the prefrontal
cortex may be recruited to the neural circuitry regulating rein-
statement only after extinction, to resolve the conflict created by
these opposing memories “to seek” or “not to seek,” depending
on current conditions (Quirk et al., 2006; Sharpe and Killcross,
2015). Cocaine craving has been proposed to “incubate” over the
course of protracted withdrawal periods like those used in the
present study (Tran-Nguyen et al., 1998; Grimm et al., 2001); and
although we made no statistical comparisons between our absti-
nent versus extinction cohorts, cocaine seeking after abstinence
was consistently higher than that after extinction (�15–45 more
active lever presses/h). Thus, extinction-induced plasticity may
oppose some of the neuroadaptations driving incubation.
However, our data indicate that vmPFC activation, even when
restricted to NAshell-projecting neurons, relies on additional
extinction-induced plasticity to reduce cocaine seeking, and the
unmasking of silent synapses in the NAshell during protracted
abstinence may be permissive to such extinction-related neuro-
adaptations (Ma et al., 2014).
Interestingly, the effects of vmPFC activation did not extend
to relapse triggered by exposure to cocaine. This may result from
a cocaine-induced increase in dopamine tone in the NAshell,
which has been shown to override the effect of vmPFC activation
(LaLumiere et al., 2012). This increase in dopamine would be
expected to shift accumbens output from a dopamine D2 to D1
receptor-mediated state (Luo et al., 2011), consistent with reports
that D2 signaling reduces, whereas D1 promotes, cocaine see-
king (Lobo et al., 2010; Ortinski et al., 2015). Although specula-
tive, this hypothesis predicts that the extinction-like effects of
vmPFC activation could be mediated through projections to D2-
expressing NAshell medium spiny neurons (Berendse et al.,
1992). Future studies in D2 knock-out or transgenic lines will be
necessary to address this hypothetical anatomy.
The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a critical component of
the neural circuitry mediating cue-induced reinstatement
(McLaughlin and See, 2003), but not cocaine-primed reinstate-
ment (McFarland and Kalivas, 2001). One alternative explana-
tion for the selective effect on cue-induced reinstatement may
involve a relay through the BLA. Approximately 7% of vmPFC
projections to the NAshell collateralize to the BLA (Pinto and
Sesack, 2000). The retro-DREADD approach used to target the
vmPFC-NAshell pathway does not rule out the potential involve-
ment of collateralized targets. Activation of these neurons with
the Gq-DREADD would be expected to result in glutamate re-
lease in the BLA and activation of BLA output, which theoreti-
cally promotes cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking.
However, glutamatergic mechanisms within the BLA have also
been implicated in extinction of cocaine-associated cues (Felten-
stein and See, 2007). Thus, it is possible that coordinate activation
of vmPFC inputs to the BLA may contribute to the extinction-
like reductions in cocaine seeking observed with chemogenetic
activation of the vmPFC-NAshell pathway here.
Another important consideration is the role of contextual
conditioned cues on extinction and relapse in the present study.
The hippocampus sends glutamatergic projections to both the
vmPFC and the medial NAshell (Berendse et al., 1992; Brog et al.,
1993; Hoover and Vertes, 2007), and these projections likely con-
vey important information about the context in which behavior
occurs (Bouton, 2002, 2006). Hippocampal input to the vmPFC
is known to be important for extinction memory consolidation
and retrieval (Kalisch et al., 2006; Peters et al., 2010), which may
reflect the importance of the conditioned context in gating re-
sponses to discrete conditioned cues (O’Donnell and Grace,
1995; Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012). In the present study, contextual
cues were extinguished before testing the ability of discrete co-
caine cues to trigger reinstatement. Thus, it is possible that
vmPFC activation promotes retrieval of a context extinction
memory that opposes cocaine seeking triggered by the unextin-
guished, discrete cocaine cues. Given that prefrontal and hip-
pocampal inputs converge onto the same accumbens neurons
(French and Totterdell, 2002), coordinated plasticity in these sys-
tems may be required for chemogenetic vmPFC activation to
alter accumbens output.
It is important to note that, in the present study, we eliminated
animals where DREADD expression was absent, as well as those
where expression was not restricted to vmPFC. However, we did
not eliminate animals based on terminal fiber expression at the
level of the nucleus accumbens (in the retro-DREADD cohorts).
DREADD expression was evident in fibers within the NAshell,

 but also frequently in more medial regions, such as the horizontal
limb of the diagonal band. Indeed, the vmPFC projects to this
area (Vertes, 2004), which is highly interconnected with the hip-
pocampus (Swanson, 1977). Thus, this pathway may also inte-
grate contextual information from the hippocampus with
behavioral action and contribute to the extinction-promoting
effects of CNO observed in the present study. Unlike the NAshell,
however, neurons in the diagonal band project back to the pre-
frontal cortex (Bloem et al., 2014). It will be imperative to deter-
mine whether this feedback loop is important for extinction, or
whether projections from the NAshell to the ventral pallidum,
hypothalamus, or ventral tegmental area are key outputs (Groe-
newegen et al., 1999; Otake and Nakamura, 2000; Marchant et al.,
2010).
In this study, we were able to promote extinction-like reduc-
tions in cocaine seeking in the presence of cocaine cues by che-
mogenetically activating a discrete projection from vmPFC to
NAshell. Approximately 23% of layer 5 neurons in vmPFC proj-
ect to the ventral striatum (Gabbott et al., 2005); and although we
did not quantify this in the present study, the expression levels
observed in vmPFC after CAV-Cre injections in the NAshell
are consistent with this estimate. However, functional neuronal
ensembles responsible for encoding specific memories are esti-
mated to be on the order of 3%–6% of the total neuronal popu-
lation, which is a much more restricted population than the one
targeted with our retro-DREADD approach. It will be important
to determine the relevant efferent targets of extinction memory
ensembles in vmPFC, for example, using a Tet-tagged DREADD
approach (Garner et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015). Given that
these ensembles appear to be separate from those encoding re-
ward (Warren et al., 2016), diverse functional ensembles within
vmPFC may explain the apparent lack of a vmPFC-mediated
inhibition of heroin-seeking animals (Bossert et al., 2011, 2012;
Peters et al., 2013).
Future studies should also address the ability of chemogenetic
vmPFC activation to reduce cocaine seeking in models that use
prolonged access to cocaine and models that focus on individual
differences in addiction vulnerability (Ahmed and Koob, 1998;
Deroche-Gamonet et al., 2004). Nonetheless, the present data
denote the first use of DREADD-based therapies to exploit
known extinction circuits to reduce cocaine relapse. Activation of
the Gq-DREADD within the vmPFC-NAshell pathway promoted
extinction-like reductions in relapse in the face of reminder cues.
Selective targeting of extinction neural circuits in this manner
may provide effective treatment with reduced side effects through
other systems.
