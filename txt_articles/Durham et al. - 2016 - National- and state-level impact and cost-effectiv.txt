Every year in the United States more than 12,000 women are
diagnosed with cervical cancer, a disease principally caused by human
papillomavirus (HPV). Bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines protect
against 66% of HPV-associated cervical cancers, and a new nonavalent
vaccine protects against an additional 15% of cervical cancers.
However, vaccination policy varies across states, and migration be-
tween states interdependently dilutes state-specific vaccination
policies. To quantify the economic and epidemiological impacts of
switching to the nonavalent vaccine both for individual states and for
the nation as a whole, we developed a model of HPV transmission and
cervical cancer incidence that incorporates state-specific demographic
dynamics, sexual behavior, and migratory patterns. At the national
level, the nonavalent vaccine was shown to be cost-effective compared
with the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines at any coverage
despite the greater per-dose cost of the new vaccine. Furthermore,
the nonavalent vaccine remains cost-effective with up to an additional
40% coverage of the adolescent population, representing 80% of girls
and 62% of boys. We find that expansion of coverage would have the
greatest health impact in states with the lowest coverage because of
the decreasing marginal returns of herd immunity. Our results show
that if policies promoting nonavalent vaccine implementation and
expansion of coverage are coordinated across multiple states, all states
benefit both in health and in economic terms.

H
uman papillomavirus (HPV) is the most prevalent sexually
transmitted infection in the United States (1). Although
more than 100 types of HPV have been identified, HPV-16 and
HPV-18 are responsible for 66% of cervical cancers (2). Two
vaccines, Gardasil (4vHPV) and Cervarix (2vHPV), were ap-
proved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 and 2009,
respectively. Both of these vaccines are highly efficacious against
HPV-16 and HPV-18 and are partially efficacious against other
non–vaccine-targeted oncogenic serotypes (2, 3). Licensed in
2014, Gardasil-9 (9vHPV) is a new vaccine that elicits immunity to
five additional oncogenic serotypes, extending protection to 80%
of cervical cancers (2, 4). In 2007, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) recommended HPV vaccination for all
girls and women aged 9–26 y (5). In 2011, this recommendation
was extended to males to reduce transmission (3). In 2015, the
CDC recommended that females aged 11–26 y be vaccinated with
any of the three available vaccines and that males aged 11–21 y
receive either 4vHPV or 9vHPV (2). Although CDC contract and
private sector prices vary, the new vaccine, at a per-dose cost of
$126, is approximately $13 more costly than 4vHPV and $18 more
costly than 2vHPV (SI Appendix).
HPV vaccination has been recommended nationwide with
funding to enhance coverage provided by the CDC Prevention and
Public Health Fund (PPHF) (6). Vaccine cost, the availability of
subsidies, and the supplementing of federal support with state and
local funds have been shown to increase coverage significantly (7).
Although some states have taken no action to promote HPV
vaccination, others have adopted measures that range from
mandating HPV vaccination as a prerequisite for school atten-
dance to permitting vaccination in pharmacies (8–10).
Migration among states generates complex interdependency
among state-specific policies, but the impact of the variation in
policy implementation and resulting vaccination coverage on HPV
epidemiology has not been previously evaluated. To project the
long-term impact of these dynamics, we developed a geographically
explicit model of HPV transmission and cervical cancer progres-
sion, incorporating 10 oncogenic serotypes, demographics, age and
gender-specific sexual behavior, and interstate and international
migration. We found that switching to 9vHPV dominates 2vHPV/
4vHPV, producing greater health benefits at the same or lower
societal cost. Furthermore, because of the decreasing marginal
returns of vaccination that arise through herd immunity, expan-
sions in coverage are predicted to avert up to 66% more cervical
cancers and deaths if targeted in states with the lowest coverage as
compared with those states with the greatest coverage. However, as
a result of migration between states, 29–84% of the long-term
health benefit of a state’s vaccination will be realized beyond its
borders. We find that all states will achieve greater reductions in
both the incidence of and expenditure for cervical cancer if vac-
cination policies are coordinated among states.
Results
Accounting for interstate migration and current heterogeneous
state vaccination rates that range from 20–57% full-series cover-
age for girls (Fig. 1) and 9–43% full-series coverage for boys (6),
we quantified the public health impact of switching from 2vHPV/
4vHPV to 9vHPV nationwide. From the national perspective, we
Significance
Vaccination protects against human papilloma virus (HPV)-
induced cervical cancer, but coverage varies markedly across the
United States. The nonavalent vaccine produces greater health
benefits than the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines at a lower
societal cost. Because of the impact of herd immunity, any ex-
pansion in coverage will be much more effective in reducing
cancer incidence and healthcare costs if targeted in those states
with the lowest coverage. Because of interstate migration and
the long duration between HPV infection and resultant cervical
cancer, much of the benefit of vaccination will be realized be-
yond a state’s borders. Therefore, both cervical cancer incidence
and expenditure can be substantially reduced if the states co-
ordinate policies to promote expansion of coverage, particularly
for the new nonavalent vaccine.

 found that 9vHPV would avert more cervical cancer cases and
deaths than 2vHPV/4vHPV through 2050 for any coverage (Fig.
2). In particular, vaccination with 2vHPV/4vHPV sustained at
current state-specific coverages was projected to reduce cervical
cancer incidence by 63% [95% confidence interval (CI) 50–73%]
and mortality by 43% (95% CI 22–58%). Switching to 9vHPV
while maintaining current coverage would achieve more sub-
stantial reductions, decreasing incidence by 73% (95% CI 62–
81%) and mortality by 49% (95% CI 30–62%) (Table 1).
We quantified the cost-effectiveness both of expanded coverage
and of switching to 9vHPV. Specifically, we calculated the quality-
adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, vaccination costs, and total
societal costs across a range of scenarios. We found that 9vHPV
dominates 2vHPV/4vHPV, producing greater health benefits for
the same or lower societal cost. For example, completely switching
to 9vHPV at current coverages would yield 65,000 QALYS. To
gain 65,000 QALYs using 2vHPV/4vHPV, in contrast, would re-
quire vaccination of an additional 11% of the population—an
increase from 39.7% to 50.7% for girls and from 21.6% to 32.6%
for boys. This expansion in 2vHPV/4vHPV coverage would cost
$2.7 billion more, from a societal perspective, than using 9vHPV
at current coverage, to achieve the same benefit (Fig. 3 A and B).
To quantify the robustness of the cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV to
parameter uncertainty, we conducted a probabilistic sensitivity anal-
ysis across a range of societal willingness-to-pay (WTP) per QALY
gained parameters (11). Switching completely to 9vHPV and
expanding coverage to an additional 20% of the adolescent pop-
ulation in each state would be very cost-effective at a WTP of
$53,000 [the 2015 US per capita gross domestic product (GDP)].
Switching to 9vHPV and vaccinating an additional 40% of the ad-
olescent population would be cost-effective at a WTP of $106,000
per QALY, whereas universal coverage with 9vHPV would be cost-
effective at a WTP of $159,000 per QALY (three times the 2015 US
per capita GDP) (Fig. 3C). Strategies that did not include switching
to 9vHPV would not be cost-effective at any WTP.
Increases in coverage between 2013 and 2014 were observed in
several jurisdictions that received resources from the CDC PPHF to
provide educational outreach to physicians, parents, and adolescents
and for other measures (6). This experience suggests that additional
resources may be necessary to increase uptake further as coverage
rises (12). To quantify the impact of increasing investment on the
cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV, we considered three scenarios (concave,
convex, and linear) of rising marginal vaccination costs. We calibrated
these scenarios to the observed improvements in HPV coverage
among jurisdictions receiving support from the PPHF (6, 12). We
found that the cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV was robust for all these
scenarios of increasing marginal vaccination costs (SI Appendix).
We evaluated the impact from the national perspective of het-
erogeneity in state-specific coverage on vaccination outcomes and
cost-effectiveness. Specifically, we calculated the HPV-associated
cervical cancer incidence, mortality, and incremental cost-effec-
tiveness ratio (ICER) of national and state-specific expansions in
coverage. We focused on 9vHPV, given its favorability compared
with 2vHPV/4vHPV (Fig. 3). We compared a coordinated national
increase in coverage of 10% for all states with a unilateral increase
of 10% for each state individually (including Washington, DC)
while every other state remained unchanged (Fig. 4). A coordinated
national increase of 10% was projected to avert 12 cancers and 1.8
deaths per 10,000 vaccines administered, at an ICER of $40,000 per
QALY. In contrast, for states with low coverage such as Mississippi,
Kansas, Arkansas, and Tennessee, 10% increases in vaccination
were projected to avert up to 20 cancers and three deaths per
10,000 vaccines administered at an ICER of $13,500 per QALY.
For states with high coverage, such as California, Pennsylvania, and
Rhode Island, a 10% expansion in vaccination would avert as few as
9.3 cancers and 1.4 deaths per 10,000 vaccines at an ICER of
$56,400 per QALY (Fig. 4 A–C). Thus, the effectiveness of ex-
panded coverage in any one state is inversely proportional to the
adolescent female coverage that already has been achieved in that
state. This result indicates that, because of herd immunity, the
marginal benefit of vaccination decreases as coverage increases.
Consequently, the United States as a whole will achieve the greatest
improvements in health outcomes if expansions to coverage are
targeted first toward states with the lowest coverage.
Because of the lengthy duration between the average age of
vaccination and the onset of cervical cancer, a substantial number
of women will have moved to another state before the health
benefits of vaccination are realized. Consequently, 16–71% of the
cervical cancers averted by expansion of coverage within an indi-
vidual state will occur within that state’s borders, and the remainder
of cases will be averted in other states (Fig. 4D). As a result, states
with low emigration rates such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio,
Texas, and Alabama exercise much greater control over health
outcomes within their borders, whereas states with high emi-
gration rates such as Hawaii, Wyoming, and Alaska are effec-
tively subsidizing health outcomes in other states.
We found that for each state the per capita cost of switching to
9vHPV ranges from −$1.84 (cost-saving) to $4.40 (Fig. 5A). If all
states switch to 9vHPV, the cost per state would fall to between
−$4.65 and $2.16 (Fig. 5B), yielding a savings of between $0.55
and $4.42 per capita (Fig. 5C). Likewise, for a unilateral switch the
corresponding health improvements would range from 0.54 to 3.1
QALYs per 10,000 population (Fig. 5D). If all states switched to
9vHPV, the health outcome for each state would rise to 1.2–4.1
QALYs per 10,000 population (Fig. 5E), a gain of 0.3–1.9 QALYs
per 10,000 (Fig. 5F). These results indicate that, although all states
benefit from cooperation, states with high emigration rates benefit
the most (Fig. 5 C and F).

 Discussion
Our results indicate that switching to 9vHPV is cost-effective for any
coverage. 9vHPV vaccination at current state-specific coverages
yields the same health benefit as does covering an additional 11% of
adolescents with 2vHPV/4vHPV at a cost that is $2.7 billion less.
Because of nonlinearities of transmission dynamics, expanding
coverage in states with the lowest coverage will be much more ef-
fective in reducing nationwide cervical cancer than expanding cov-
erage in states with the highest coverage. Thus, our results suggest
that, to have the greatest impact, resources provided to improve
HPV coverage, such as those made available by the CDC PPHF,
should be targeted at the states with the lowest coverage.
Nationally funded but locally targeted programs to promote vac-
cination are particularly appropriate, given that considerable in-
terstate migration is likely to occur between the average age of
vaccination and the average age of onset of cervical cancer that
vaccination is averting. Consequently, much of the health and eco-
nomic benefits of an HPV vaccination program within a state will
be realized beyond that state’s borders. From both national and
state-specific perspectives, these dynamics generate strong public
health and economic incentives for coordinated vaccination efforts.

 In practice, actions taken to promote vaccination involve
multiple stakeholders at a combination of the national, state, and
local levels as well as private insurance markets that cover
multiple states. Although vaccination uptake has been stymied by
factors such as vaccine price, concerns that immunization might
encourage adolescent sexual behavior, and physician reluctance
to recommend the vaccine (8, 13), lessons can be learned from
the significant increases in coverage that have been observed in
Georgia, Illinois, Montana, North Carolina, and Washington,
DC (6). These successes have been attributed to resources pro-
vided by the CDC PPHF and to multipronged strategies com-
bining cancer and vaccination initiatives, public outreach, and
physician training (6). Complementary approaches to increase
coverage include allowing pharmacists to immunize children and
implementing reminder systems to prompt physicians to offer the
vaccine (13–15). In addition, states that supplement federal and
private sector measures with local funding have been able to
achieve significantly greater HPV coverage (7).
All HPV models are limited by epidemiological and clinical
uncertainty, particularly with respect to HPV and vaccine-induced
immunity. We assumed no interactions among HPV types. Cohort
studies have found some evidence of interactions among types for
women with abnormal cytology but not for the general population
(16, 17), although models have shown that type interactions may
exist in the general population at levels that are difficult to detect
(18, 19). However, type interactions and postvaccination type
replacement is of less concern for the nonavalent vaccine that
targets most oncogenic types than for the bivalent or quadrivalent
vaccines (20).
Recent studies have indicated that fewer than three doses may
be sufficient to confer protection against HPV, although the du-
ration of such protection is unknown (21–24). Because the pos-
sibility of one- or two-dose vaccination schedules is promising but
inconclusive, we conservatively assumed that the full three doses
are necessary to achieve lasting protection against any serotype.
Should future clinical trials of lower dose schedules demonstrate
enduring protection comparable to that achieved by a three-dose
schedule (25), vaccination would be even more effective and cost-
effective than shown in our projections. In addition, our findings
that a vaccine dose has the greatest impact in states with lower
coverage and that every state benefits from cooperative vaccina-
tion policies are direct consequences of interstate migration and
therefore are robust to assumptions of dose efficacy.
Despite ongoing research, considerable empirical uncertainty
remains regarding the natural history of HPV infection and the
factors that affect the progression to cervical intraepithelial neo-
plasia (CIN). For our model we parameterized the rates of HPV
progression, cross-protection, and clearance from the control arm of
the PATRICIA clinical trial (26, 27). Although these data are
currently the most detailed estimates available, they are potentially
biased by not representing a random sample of the US population
and by having been collected from clinical observations at regular
follow-up appointments. However, any such biases do not affect our
projections significantly, as demonstrated by our model validation.
Finally, because of limited data, our model does not differentiate
between the sexual behavior and vaccination decision-making of
individuals who move to another state and individuals who do not
leave their home state. Some migrants may, after moving, maintain
sexual relationships in their previous state which would introduce
cross-state transmission. Individual-based models may be used to
incorporate heterogeneity in sexual risk behavior and vaccination
decision-making explicitly (12, 28, 29). Such individual-level het-
erogeneity may interact dynamically with heterogeneities in state-
specific screening or vaccination. Our differential-equation model,
although accounting for variance in the number of sexual partners,
does not explicitly model individual heterogeneity in sexual risk
behavior. However, any such effect will be minor relative to the
magnitude of within-state transmission.

 Considerable public health improvements and cost savings can be
achieved by switching to 9vHPV. Because of these cost savings and
the difficulty of achieving high coverage among adolescents, health
agencies may consider prioritizing switching to 9vHPV while ex-
panding coverage. Moreover, any increases in coverage would
produce the greatest benefits if these increases occur in states that
presently have low coverage. If vaccination coverage and switches to
the nonavalent vaccine are coordinated across states, every state will
reduce cervical cancer incidence and deaths as well as expenditure.
Methods
Overview. We developed an age-structured compartmental model of HPV
infection, cervical cancer, vaccination, and interstate migration for 50 states
as well as Washington, DC. We specified 24 age groups: 11 y and younger,
each year of age from 12 through 26 y, 5-y increments for ages 27 y through
46 y, 10-year increments for ages 47 y through 76 y, and 77 y and older. We
parameterized state-specific birth and age-specific death rates from the US
National Vital Statistics Reports (30, 31) and initialized the population based
upon age, gender, and state profiles from the American Community Survey
(32). The annual number of international immigrants to each state was
parameterized by combining estimates of age, gender, and state-specific
legal immigration as well as illegal immigration (Dataset S1).
To calculate the probability that an individual will emigrate between states,
we extracted the age- and state-specific 5-y migration rates from the 2000 US
Census (33). These 5-y migration rates are less sensitive than single-year mi-
gration rates to return migration, in which an individual returns to a state
within a few years, and to onwards migration, in which an individual moves
among several states over a brief period (34). We obtained the interstate
migration matrix from the American Community Survey, combining data from
2005–2013 to compensate for short-term migratory trends (32) (Dataset S1).
Sexual Mixing. We represented sexual partnerships through direct contact
mixing, based upon age- and gender-specific rates of partnership formation
estimated from the National Survey for Family Growth (35). To estimate age-
specific mixing between men and women, we combined data from adolescent
behavior surveys (36), young adult surveys (37), and marriage trends (38)
(Dataset S1). We modeled frequency-dependent heterosexual HPV transmission
as the product of the per partner transmission rate, the age- and gender-spe-
cific rate of partnership formation, the age distribution of sexual partners, and
the age-specific proportion of partners who are infected (SI Appendix).
Epidemiology. We represented men and women as susceptible, infected, re-
covered, or vaccinated against HPV, distinguishing between 2vHPV, 4vHPV, and
9vHPV. Equations and detailed parameter tables are provided (SI Appendix,
Table S1). We parameterized the type-specific HPV clearance rate in women
and the type-specific antibody protection against reinfection from the control
arm of the PATRICIA clinical trial (26, 39), the type-specific clearance rate in
men from the HIM cohort study (40), the type-specific probability of de-
veloping antibodies from the Slovenian HPV prevalence survey (41), and the
type-specific rate of antibody decay from the Finnish Family HPV study (42).
Building on previous cervical cancer progression models (43, 44), we as-
sumed that HPV infection leads to CIN grades 2 (CIN-2) or 3 (CIN-3) at
serotype-specific rates (39). CIN-2 and CIN-3 are detected at state- and age-
specific rates of cervical screening, estimated from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System, incorporating test sensitivity (45, 46). If untreated, CIN-2
may progress to CIN-3, and either CIN-2 or CIN-3 may progress to local cer-
vical cancer (LCC) (45–47). In addition, CIN-2 and CIN-3 may regress sponta-
neously (47, 48). Undiagnosed LCC progresses to regional cervical cancer
(RCC), and undiagnosed RCC progresses to distant cervical cancer (DCC) with
mortality increasing at each stage (44). LCC, RCC, and DCC may be detected
at incrementally higher rates, with diagnosed cancers subject to treatment
and cure at progressively lower rates. We assumed the risk of developing
CIN-2, CIN-3, or cervical cancer to be independent of age (47, 49).
We independently modeled HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, and
58. We assumed that HPV types do not interact. Because concurrent HPV
infections increase the cervical cancer risk approximately linearly (39, 50), we
summed cervical cancer incidence and mortality across the 10 types.
Calibration. We defined uncertainty distributions for each model parameter from
the epidemiological and clinical literature. We then used Markov Chain Monte
Carlo simulation to calibrate our model without the vaccination component to
prevaccine era serotype-specific female-age seroprevalence, male seroprevalence,
cervical cancer incidence, and ratio of female–male transmission to male–female
transmission. To obtain serotype-specific parameter estimates and posterior
distributions for the female–male and the male–female transmission rates, we
conducted this calibration procedure for each of the 10 HPV types (SI Appendix).
Validation. To validate our model, we compared model-predicted cervical
cancer incidence with the state-specific estimates over the period 2003–2006.
We found close agreement between our model and the data, with the
empirical estimate falling within the 95% CI of our model predictions for 48
of 51 states (SI Appendix).
Vaccine Efficacy. We parameterized type-specific and cross-protective effi-
cacies for 2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV from the corresponding phase III clinical
trials (4, 51–55). Because 9vHPV has been shown to be immunogenic in males
(56) but efficacy estimates of 9vHPV in males are not yet available, we used
the same efficacy for both males and females. Clinical trials and statistical
projections have demonstrated sustained efficacy with no detectable wan-
ing for both 2vHPV and 4vHPV (57–59). Although recent studies suggest that
protective efficacy may be conferred by incomplete vaccine regimens, the
long-term efficacy for a subdose vaccine regimen is presently inconclusive
(21–24). Therefore, we conservatively assumed that the full three-dose
regimen is required to protect against HPV.
To model vaccination coverage, we initialized age- and state-specific rates
of vaccination among men and women. We conservatively assumed no
further catch-up vaccination among adults and modeled adolescent vacci-
nation before sexual debut at state-, age-, and gender-specific rates. We
incorporated a scale-up period in adolescent vaccination from 2008 to 2014,
the most recent year for which data were available (6, 10, 60–64). State-
specific coverage and series completion among girls ranged from 20% to
57%, with a median of 40% full-series coverage in New Mexico (Fig. 1). For
our base case, we assumed that adolescent vaccination continued at 2014
coverage (6, 60–62). Before the availability of 9vHPV in 2015, we assumed
that all vaccinated males received 4vHPV and that 50% of vaccinated fe-
males received 2vHPV and the others received 4vHPV (3).
Cost-Effectiveness. We calculated the net present value costs and effective-
ness associated with each vaccination strategy from the societal perspective
at both the national and at the state level, assuming an annual 3% discount
rate, from 2015 to 2050 (65). To calculate costs, we summed the cost of
vaccination with administration, assuming $129 per dose for 2vHPV, $135
per dose for 4vHPV, and $148 per dose of 9vHPV (SI Appendix, Table S1), as
well as treatment costs for CIN-2, CIN-3, LCC, RCC, and DCC (66, 67). To
quantify effectiveness, we considered the total QALYs under each scenario,
assigning established weights to CIN-2, CIN-3, LCC, RCC, and DCC (66, 67).
We compared the health and economic impact of varying adolescent cov-
erage and the degree to which vaccine providers switch from 2vHPV/4vHPV to
9vHPV. We considered six coverages: (i) current state-specific rates; increases of
(ii) 10%, (iii) 20%, (iv) 30%, and (v) 40% in the fraction of the population
covered; and (vi) 100% adolescent coverage. For each coverage, we also
considered the proportion switching to 9vHPV as (i) none, (ii) 0.25, (iii) 0.5, and
(iv) complete switching. We computed the QALYs gained, vaccination costs,
and total societal costs for each of the 24 scenarios (SI Appendix).
Data analysis and visualization were aided by Daniel’s XL Toolbox (68).
