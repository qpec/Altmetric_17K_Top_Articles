abstract
OBJECTIVES: This study analyzes and compares exposures to prescription opioids among 
children and adolescents younger than 20 years old in the United States.
METHODS: Data from the National Poison Data System for 2000 through 2015 were analyzed.
RESULTS: Poison control centers received reports of 188 468 prescription opioid exposures 
among children aged <20 years old from 2000 through 2015. The annual number and 
rate of exposures increased early in the study period, but declined after 2009, except for 
buprenorphine exposures, which increased during the last 3 study years. Hydrocodone 
accounted for the largest proportion of exposures (28.7%), and 47.1% of children exposed 
to buprenorphine were admitted to a health care facility (HCF). The odds of being admitted 
to an HCF were higher for teenagers than for children aged 0 to 5 years (odds ratio [OR]: 
2.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.78–2.94) or children aged 6 to 12 years (OR: 6.62; 
95% CI: 6.06–7.02). Teenagers also had greater odds of serious medical outcomes than did 
children aged 0 to 5 years (OR: 3.03; 95% CI: 2.92–3.15) or children aged 6 to 12 years (OR: 
4.59; 95% CI: 4.21–5.00). The rate of prescription opioid–related suspected suicides among 
teenagers increased by 52.7% during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Prescription opioid–related HCF admissions and serious medical outcomes 
were higher among teenagers. Contrary to trends for other prescription opioids, exposures 
to buprenorphine have increased in recent years; children aged 0 to 5 years accounted for 
almost 90% of buprenorphine exposures. These findings indicate that additional prevention 
efforts are needed.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Previous reports 
have shown that opioids are heavily prescribed to 
the general population in the United States and have 
the highest overdose rate among all prescription 
drugs. Analgesics are the third most commonly 
implicated substances in poison center pediatric 
exposures.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: From 2000 through 2015, 
188 468 pediatric opioid exposures were reported 
to US poison control centers. Health care facility 
admission occurred in 8.7% and 21.5% of exposures 
among 0- to 5-year-olds and teenagers, respectively. 
Serious outcomes were more frequent among 
teenagers.

Pain is one of the most common 
reasons individuals in the United 
States seek health care, and of 
those, 20% are prescribed opioid 
analgesics. 
1, 
 
2 Eighty percent of 
opioid prescriptions worldwide are 
distributed in the United States. 
3 
From 1999 to 2010, opioid sales in 
the United States quadrupled, and 
in 2012, an estimated 259 million 
prescriptions for opioid medications 
were written. 
2 This rapid increase 
stemmed from concerns raised in 
the 1990s that physicians were not 
adequately treating patient pain.4 As 
a result, pain management guidelines 
were revised to favor more liberal 
prescribing of opioid medications. As 
opioid use became more prevalent, 
pediatric exposures to these drugs 
increased. From 2006 to 2012, 
>22 000 children were treated in US 
emergency departments for opioid 
poisoning. 
5 The annual rate of opioid 
poisoning–related hospitalization 
increased by 165% from 1997 to 
2012. 
6 Opioid exposures at even 
relatively low doses can result in 
life-threatening effects in children. 
7 
In September 2016, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics recommended 
halting codeine use among children 
because of the risk of breathing 
complications. 
8
Currently, there is an opioid epidemic 
in the United States, with the rate of 
opioid overdose deaths, including 
deaths from opioid medications and 
heroin, doubling since 2000. 
9 
 
– 
12 
Unintentional poisonings are now 
the leading cause of injury-related 
mortality in the United States.13 
Among teenagers aged 15 to 19 
years, there was a 91% increase in 
fatal poisoning from 2000 to 2009, 
which was mostly attributable to 
an increase in prescription drug 
overdoses. 
14 Nearly 1 in 4 high 
school seniors in the United States 
has had some lifetime exposure to 
prescription opioids, either medically 
or nonmedically. 
15 These exposures 
can lead to future use of illegal 
substances; almost 80% of new 
heroin users have previously used 
opioid pain medications. 
16 
–18
Although multiple studies have 
described the epidemiology 
of opioid overdose 
10 
– 
12, 
 
19 and 
misuse12, 
 
14 in the United States, 
little research has been published 
examining opioid poisoning among 
children, particularly those aged 
<6 years old. Three studies on 
opioid poisoning among children 
included only individuals treated 
in emergency departments 
5, 
 
20 or 
those who were hospitalized. 
6 Other 
research has focused on pediatric 
poisoning fatalities.21 The current 
study analyzes National Poison Data 
System (NPDS) data to define the 
epidemiology of opioid exposures 
among US children aged <20 years 
old.
METHODS
Data Sources and Study Design
Opioid exposure data were obtained 
from the NPDS, a poison surveillance 
database maintained by the American 
Association of Poison Control 
Centers (AAPCC). NPDS data are 
collected by regional poison control 
centers (PCCs) covering the entire 
population of the United States and 
its territories. PCC specialists receive 
telephone calls reporting poison 
exposures, provide medical advice on 
exposure management, and record 
details about each exposure. 
22
Case Selection Criteria
The AAPCC uses generic codes to 
group broad categories of related 
substances. Generic codes were used 
to query the NPDS for all single-
substance exposure calls involving 
opioids among children aged <20 
years old from 2000 through 2015. 
The search identified 195 813 cases, 
of which 188 468 met study inclusion 
criteria. Cases were excluded if 
the exposure reason was “adverse 
reaction–food, 
” “adverse reaction–
other, 
” “other–contamination/
tampering, 
” “unintentional–bite/
sting, 
” “unintentional-environmental, 
” 
or “unintentional–food poisoning.” 
Cases were also excluded if the 
medical outcome was “confirmed 
nonexposure” or if the PCC specialist 
did not believe the exposure was 
responsible for the observed clinical 
effect(s).
Variables
Opioid medications were categorized 
as hydrocodone, codeine, oxycodone, 
propoxyphene, tramadol, morphine, 
methadone, buprenorphine, 
meperidine, hydromorphone, 
fentanyl, oxymorphone, and 
as “other” (see Supplemental 
Information). The level of care 
received was used to describe 
whether individuals were admitted 
to a health care facility (HCF; critical 
care unit, non–critical care unit, or 
psychiatric care unit) or not admitted 
(treated/evaluated and released, 
no HCF treatment received, lost to 
follow-up or left against medical 
advice, or refused referral/did not 
arrive at HCF). Medical outcomes 
were grouped into serious outcome 
(death, major effect, or moderate 
effect), minor effect, no effect, and 
not followed/unable to follow. 
The NPDS defines major effects as 
symptoms that are life-threatening 
or result in significant disability or 
disfigurement. 
23 Moderate effects 
are more pronounced, prolonged, 
or systemic than minor symptoms 
and typically require treatment. 
23 
Patients displaying minor effects 
have minimal symptoms that resolve 
quickly. 
23
Reason for exposure was 
categorized as unintentional-general 
(including exploratory behaviors), 
unintentional–therapeutic error, 
intentional (abuse, misuse, 
suspected suicide, unknown), 
other (adverse reaction, malicious 
intent, withdrawal, occupational 
exposure, unintentional misuse), and 
unknown. Substance formulations 
were grouped into solid (tablets/
capsules/caplets), liquid, other

(aerosol/mist/spray/gas, cream/
lotion/gel, patch, powder/granules, 
or other), and unknown. Exposure 
site was classified as residence (own 
or other), other (HCF, public area, 
restaurant/food service, school, 
workplace, or other), or unknown. 
Children were divided into 3 age 
groups: 0 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, 
and teenagers (13–19 years). Other 
analyzed variables included the 
following: sex, chronicity of exposure, 
exposure management site, type of 
therapeutic error, route of exposure, 
and scenario of access to medication.
Statistical Analysis and Ethical 
Concerns
NPDS data were analyzed by using 
SPSS 21.0 for Windows (IBM 
Corporation) and SAS Enterprise 
Guide 7.11 HF3 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC) software. Exposure rates 
were calculated by using US Census 
Bureau July 1st intercensal and 
postcensal population estimates for 
children aged <20 years old from 
2000 through 2015. 
24, 
 
25 Piecewise 
linear regression was used to analyze 
exposure trends with the use of 2009 
as a breakpoint. The estimated slope 
from the regression model (m) is 
reported along with the associated 
P value. Logistic regression was used 
to analyze serious medical outcomes 
and HCF admissions by type of opioid 
exposure and age group. Odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were calculated. Statistical 
significance was determined at 
α = 0.05. NPDS data did not include 
patient identifiers. This study was 
judged exempt by the institutional 
review board at the Research Institute 
at Nationwide Children's Hospital. 
RESULTS
General Characteristics
From 2000 through 2015, PCCs 
reported 188 468 opioid exposures 
among children aged <20 years old, 
averaging 11 779 exposures annually 
or 14.34 exposures per 100 000 
children. Most opioid exposures 
occurred at a residence (95.8%; 
 
Table 1) and resulted from ingestion 
(98.4%). Exposures were most 
common among children aged 0 to 5 
years (59.7%), followed by teenagers 
(29.9%). Examining the data by 
single years of age, opioid exposure 
frequency and rate increased sharply 
at 1 and 2 years and then declined 
before increasing modestly among 
teenagers ( 
Fig 1). The mean and 
median ages of exposure were 7.1 
(SD: 6.6) years and 3 (interquartile 
range: 2–14) years, respectively. Boys 
accounted for 50.9% of exposures to 
opioids overall, 53.2% of exposures 
among children aged 0 to 5 years, and 
57.9% of exposures among children 
aged 6 to 12 years of age ( 
Table 1). 
Among teenagers, more exposures 
occurred among girls (55.7%). The 
opioid medications most commonly 
implicated in exposure were 
hydrocodone (28.7%), oxycodone 
(17.6%), and codeine (16.5%).
Unintentional-general was the 
most common reason for opioid 
exposure overall (56.1%), but 
there were variations by age ( 
Table 
1). Among children aged 6 to 12 
years, more than one-half of all 
exposures (54.5%) were therapeutic 
errors. Among teenagers, 71.5% of 
exposures were intentional, including 
the following: suspected suicide 
(34.2%), abuse (20.8%), and misuse 
(11.2%). Overall, 93.8% of exposures 
were acute. Therapeutic errors 
accounted for 18.1% of all exposures; 
of these, inadvertently took/given 
someone else’s medication (25.3%), 
wrong medication taken/given 
(24.7%), and other incorrect dose 
(13.7%) were the most common 
types of errors ( 
Table 2). Scenarios 
of access to the medication were 
recorded for 6286 exposures (3.3%), 
and 94.6% of these were for children 
aged 0 to 5 years. Among this age 
group, product stored within sight 
of the child (34.8%), product stored 
inappropriately (13.6%), and child 
accessed medication from purse 
(13.3%) were the most commonly 
documented scenarios.
Trends
From 2000 to 2009, the overall 
annual number of opioid exposures 
increased significantly by 86.0% 
(m = 745.8, P < .001) and the rate 
per 100 000 children increased 
significantly by 79.9% (m = 0.86, 
P < .001), followed by a significant 
decline in the number (−31.4%; 
m = −712.5, P < .001) and rate 
(−30.5%; m = −0.82, P < .001) from 
2009 through 2015 ( 
Fig 2). The 
annual rate of opioid exposures per 
100 000 children aged 0 to 5 years 
old increased significantly by 93.2% 
(m = 2.02, P < .001) from 2000 to 
2009, followed by a 29.4% (m = 
−1.47, P < .001) decrease from 2009 
through 2015 ( 
Fig 2). Similarly, 
the rate increased significantly 
among children aged 6 to 12 years 
old (53.4%; m = 0.14, P < .001) and 
teenagers (56.8%; m = 0.53, P < .001) 
during 2000–2009, before declining 
by 31.7% (m = −0.25, P < .001) 
and 30.9% (m = −0.79, P < .001), 
respectively, from 2009 through 
2015 ( 
Fig 2). Notable exceptions 
to these trends are buprenorphine 
exposures, which declined from 
2011 to 2013 before increasing in 
2014–2015, and tramadol exposures, 
which decreased from 2000 to 2003 
and then increased steadily before 
plateauing after 2012. In addition, 
propoxyphene exposures declined 
slowly from 2005 to 2009 and more 
sharply from 2010 through 2015. 
Another exception to the overall 
trend was the rate of suspected 
suicide among teenagers, which 
increased by 52.7% (m = 0.10, 
P < .001) from 2000 through 2015.
Management Site, Level of Health 
Care Received, and Medical Outcome
Overall, more than half of exposed 
children were either referred to an 
HCF by a PCC (28.1%) or already in 
(or en route to) an HCF when the 
PCC was called (27.5%;  
Table 2).

children were treated/evaluated and 
released and 12.0% were admitted 
for care. Overall, 6.6% of exposed 
children experienced serious medical 
outcomes, including 175 fatalities 
(0.1%). Of the children who died, 
54.9% were teenagers, 71.4% 
were boys, 49.1% had intentional 
exposures, and most were exposed 
to either methadone (40.0%) or 
oxycodone (22.9%). Children 
intentionally exposed to prescription 
opioids had 4.56 (95% CI: 4.43–4.70) 
times higher odds of being admitted 
than children exposed to prescription 
opioids for other reasons. The odds 
of being admitted to an HCF were 
higher for teenagers than for children 
aged 0 to 5 years (OR: 2.86; 95% CI: 
2.78–2.94) or children aged 6 to 12 
years (OR: 6.52; 95% CI: 6.06–7.02) 
( 
Table 3). Teenagers also had greater 
odds of experiencing serious medical 
outcomes than children aged 0 to 5 
years (OR: 3.03; 95% CI: 2.92–3.15) or 
children aged 6 to 12 years (OR: 4.59; 
95% CI: 4.21–5.00). Compared with 
children aged 6 to 12 years, children 
aged 0 to 5 years old had greater odds 
of being admitted to an HCF (OR: 2.28; 
95% CI: 2.12–2.47) or experiencing 
serious medical outcomes (OR: 1.51; 
95% CI: 1.39–1.65).
Children exposed to buprenorphine 
had greater odds of HCF admission

serious medical outcomes. Children

88.1% of buprenorphine exposures, 
and of these, 51.0% were admitted to 
an HCF ( 
Table 3). Among teenagers, 
the proportion of exposures resulting 
in HCF admission was highest among 
those exposed to fentanyl (35.0%), 
oxymorphone (33.3%), methadone 
(32.3%), and tramadol (31.5%).
Clinical Effects and Therapies
More than one-fourth of children 
(28.6%) experienced at least 
1 exposure-related symptom. 
Drowsiness/lethargy (17.6%) 
and vomiting (6.0%) were most 
frequent overall and also within 
each age group. Duration of clinical 
effects was reported for 21.7% of 
exposures; the majority (91.6%) 
lasted ≤24 hours. Although relatively 
uncommon, serious clinical effects 
were observed, including respiratory 
depression (1.8%; n = 3386), coma 
(0.8%; n = 1479), hypotension 
(0.4%; n = 757), respiratory arrest 
(0.2%; n = 463), and cardiac arrest/
asystole (0.1%; n = 195). One or more 
therapies were performed for 37.7% 
of exposures; the most common 
therapies were dilute/irrigate/wash 
(15.1%) and charcoal–single dose 
(9.6%). Naloxone was administered 
to 8751 children (4.6%).
DISCUSSION
General
During the 16-year study period, 
there were 188 468 opioid exposures 
among children aged <20 years 
reported to PCCs in the United States. 
The majority of exposures occurred 
among children aged 0 to 5 years 
and were managed on site without 
serious medical outcomes. There was 
a steady increase in the frequency 
and rate of opioid exposures from 
2000 until 2009, after which both 
decreased. The observed increase 
in exposures was likely driven by 
increased opioid prescribing in the 
United States, with the number of 
opioid prescriptions dispensed by 
US retail pharmacies increasing from 
126 million in 2000 to 219 million in 
2011 before declining to 207 million 
in 2013. 
19 It is unclear why the 
decline in exposures began 2 years 
before the decline in the number 
of prescriptions. Possible factors 
contributing to the observed decline 
in exposures after 2009 include the 
9.2% reduction in the number of US 
patients filling opioid prescriptions 
from 2009 to 2013, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) implementation of the 
PROTECT initiative, and the US Drug 
Enforcement Administration's 2014 
decision to designate hydrocodone 
combination products as schedule II 
drugs. 
26 
 
–29
Overall, male and female exposure 
trends were similar. Consistent 
with previous studies, reasons for 
exposure varied by age, with children 
aged 0 to 5 years experiencing 
unintentional exposures attributable 
to exploratory behaviors and 
teenagers exhibiting risk-taking 
behaviors by using opioids 
intentionally. 
18, 
 
30 
 
–33 Combined, 
children aged 0 to 5 years old and 
teenagers accounted for nearly 90% 
of all prescription opioid exposures. 
Hydrocodone was the most common 
medication implicated in exposures. 
Methadone and buprenorphine were 
associated with a large percentage of 
HCF admissions and serious medical 
outcomes, including fatalities, despite 
having fewer exposures overall. HCF 
admission was likely more common 
for these medications because of 
concerns about prolonged or delayed 
respiratory depression seen with 
their long half-lives. 
34
Exposures Among Children 0 to 5 
Years of Age
Children aged 0 to 5 years old 
experienced the largest number of 
exposures. Most were unintentional-
general (nontherapeutic) exposures 
(85.5%) attributable to exploratory 
behaviors common among young 
children. 
30, 
 
35 The toxicity of an 
opioid exposure can be greater for 
children than adults due to their 
smaller body mass. Nearly 90% of 
buprenorphine exposures in this 
study were among children aged 0 to 
5

5 years old. Ingesting even a partial 
buprenorphine tablet (0.07–0.40 
mg/kg body weight) can harm a 
child. 
36 Although the high rate of 
HCF admission for buprenorphine 
exposure may reflect clinical 
decisions to monitor patients or 
allow for investigation into the 
home environment, the frequency 
of these exposures has remained 
elevated, whereas most other opioid 
medication exposures in this age 
group have declined. Buprenorphine 
is almost exclusively prescribed for 
adults, so exposures among children 
represent a failure to safeguard the 
medication. 
36
Opioids can cause severe central 
nervous system impairment and 
respiratory depression; therefore, 
preventing exposures among young 
children is imperative. Unit-dose 
packaging is 1 strategy that has 
been shown to prevent unintentional 
medication exposure deaths. 
37, 
 
38 
Alternate drug formulations 
and delivery systems, such as 
subcutaneous implants, also should 
be considered as a means of 
reducing pediatric exposures. In 
2008, the CDC established the 
PROTECT initiative to prevent 
unintentional pediatric medication 
exposures by bringing together key 
stakeholders to develop prevention

strategies. 
29 For example, the “Up 
and Away and Out of Sight” campaign 
educates parents on how to safely 
store medications. 
39 Patient-
provider agreements are another 
recommended intervention strategy. 
It should be noted, however, that not 
all opioid users obtain their drugs 
legally. Buprenorphine, for example, 
is frequently purchased illegally by 
individuals with opioid addiction, 
who are seeking to self-medicate or 
cope with withdrawal.40 Addressing 
this and other examples of opioid 
diversion requires additional 
prevention strategies.
Exposures Among Teenagers
Teenagers represented the age group 
with the second highest number of 
opioid exposures and more than two-
thirds were intentional exposures. 
This finding agrees with previous 
research indicating that this is the 
only age group in which intentional 
poisonings are more common than 
unintentional ones. 
22 Also consistent 
with previous research, boys 
accounted for a larger proportion 
of intentional opioid exposures 
than girls. 
41 The majority of teenage 
fatalities resulting from intentional 
opioid exposures were among 
boys, but girls comprised a greater 
proportion of suspected suicide 
exposures. Previous studies indicate 
that girls tend to use less violent 
suicide methods, such as medication 
ingestion, than males. 
31, 
 
32 
It is especially concerning that the 
rate of opioid exposure attributable 
to suspected suicide increased by 
52.7% among teenagers during 
the study period. This finding is 
consistent with results from another 
study that showed that the rate of 
opioid-related hospitalization among 
adolescents aged 15 to 19 years 
attributed to suicide or self-inflicted 
injury increased by 140% from 1997 
to 2012.6 Teenagers had greater 
odds of being admitted to an HCF 
and experiencing serious outcomes 
than the younger age groups in 
this study. The higher rate of HCF 
admission may partially reflect 
the need to thoroughly evaluate 
incidents of suspected self-harm. 
Intentional opioid exposures among 
teenagers may also result from risk-
taking behaviors or attempts to self-
medicate psychological problems. 
33, 
 
41 
In addition, prescription opioid 
misuse may increase the likelihood 
of an individual using heroin or other 
illicit drugs in the future. 
16, 
 
17
Restricting access to opioids by 
teenagers is an important prevention

strategy. Seventy percent of 
teenagers who use prescription 
medications without a physician’s 
order obtain the drugs from friends 
or relatives. 
42 Physicians can help 
reduce the availability of opioids by 
using correct dosing (not prescribing 
a higher dose or greater supply than 
necessary), reminding parents to 
safeguard prescription medications 
(including from teenagers), and 
encouraging prompt and proper 
disposal of unused medications. 
The National Institute on Drug 
Abuse offers online training to teach 
physicians techniques for managing 
patients prescribed opioids. 
43 
The CDC encourages states to use 
prescription drug–monitoring 
programs and supports insurance 
policies and legal strategies to reduce 
abuse, diversion, and overdose. 
44 
The provision of naloxone kits to 
laypersons who might witness a 
prescription opioid overdose is 
another promising intervention. 
45
An estimated 22% of teenagers 
in the United States have mental 
health disorders that result in severe 
impairment or distress. 
46 Increasing 
access to mental health screening 
and treatment of adolescents may 
reduce the abuse of opioids for 
self-medication and self-harm. The 
National Institute on Drug Abuse 
recommends several research-based 
programs to prevent adolescent 
drug abuse, including the Life 
Skills Training Program and the 
Strengthening Families Program. 
47 
For teenagers with opioid use 
disorders, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics recommends medication-
assisted treatment. 
48 This method 
requires precautions to avoid 
increased exposure among young 
children.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. 
The number of pediatric exposures 
to prescription opioids is 
underestimated because not all 
exposures are reported to PCCs. 
The NPDS does not collect patient 
identifiers and therefore cannot 
determine repeat exposures to 
individuals. The NPDS relies on 
self-reports, which cannot be 
completely verified by PCCs or 
the AAPCC. Reported exposures 
do not necessarily represent a 
poisoning or overdose. In addition, 
some reporting fields are optional, 
such as the scenario associated 
with opioid exposure, which may 
limit interpretation. Despite these 
limitations, data in the NPDS 
national database are entered by 
highly qualified poison experts 
who use strict quality controls 
and case follow-up methods. The 
NPDS offers the most inclusive and 
comprehensive database available 
for research on prescription opioid 
exposures among US children.
Conclusions
Children are frequently overlooked 
in efforts to prevent prescription 
opioid exposures; however, these 
exposures can be life-threatening. 
Particular attention should be paid 
to buprenorphine exposures among 
young children, which frequently 
result in HCF admission and are 
not declining in frequency such as 
exposures to most other opioids. 
Teenagers are more likely to be 
intentionally exposed to opioids as a 
result of risk-taking or self-harm and 
have greater odds of HCF admission 
or serious medical outcomes than 
younger children. Greater efforts are 
needed to prevent opioid exposure to 
children of all ages.
