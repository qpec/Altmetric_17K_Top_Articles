AbstrAct
background Methamphetamine use and stroke are 
significant public health problems. Strokes among people 
aged below 45 years are much less common than in 
older age groups but have significant mortality and 
morbidity. Methamphetamine is a putative cause of 
strokes among younger people.
Methods A review of methamphetamine-related 
strokes was conducted. Bibliographic databases were 
searched until February 2017 for articles related to 
methamphetamine and stroke. Both haemorrhagic and 
ischaemic strokes were considered.
results Of 370 articles screened, 77 were selected for 
inclusion. There were 81 haemorrhagic and 17 ischaemic 
strokes reported in case reports and series. Both types 
were approximately twice as common in males. Route 
of administration associated with haemorrhagic stroke 
was typically oral or injecting, but for ischaemic stroke 
inhalation was most common. Haemorrhagic stroke 
was associated with vascular abnormalities in a third of 
cases. One quarter of individuals completely recovered, 
and a third died following haemorrhagic stroke. One-
fifth completely recovered, and one-fifth died following 
ischaemic stroke.
conclusions There is a preponderance of haemorrhagic 
strokes associated with methamphetamine use 
in young people, and methamphetamine-related 
stroke is associated with poor clinical outcomes. 
Mechanisms of methamphetamine-associated 
stroke include hypertension, vasculitis, direct 
vascular toxicity and vasospasm. In a period of rising 
worldwide methamphetamine use, the incidence of 
methamphetamine-related stroke will increase, with a 
consequent increase in the burden of disease contributed 
by such events.
IntroductIon
Methamphetamine use is a significant public 
health problem, particularly in countries around 
the Pacific rim (North America, East/Southeast 
Asia and Oceania), with an estimated 35 
million 
stimulant users worldwide, predominantly of meth-
amphetamine.1–3 Harmful physical and mental 
health consequences are common, including 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular pathology, 
psychosis, suicide and premature mortality.4–8 The 
stimulants methamphetamine and amphetamine 
have been available in various forms since the 
middle of last century.7 Methamphetamine use has 
changed over years: in 1950s and 1960s, it was 
popular as benzedrine, later amphetamine became 
the preferred form, while most recently there has 
been a substantial global increase in the availability 
and use of high potency, crystalline methamphet-
amine.1 3 9 Routes of methamphetamine administra-
tion include oral, inhalation (smoking), intranasal 
and intravenous use.7
Stroke too is a major public health problem, with 
high mortality rates and high levels of subsequent 
disability.10 11 Between 1990 and 2010, stroke 
has risen from the fifth to the third leading cause 
of disability-adjusted life years, with increase of 
19%.10 Moreover, the incidence of stroke has been 
rising among younger persons.12 While stroke inci-
dence rises with age and is less common in people 
aged below 45 years, stroke among young people 
has significant health sequelae and societal costs.12
stroke in young people
In all-age stroke populations, ischaemic strokes 
(cerebral infarction) are more common.13 In 
younger people (<45 years), this remains the case, 
but a greater proportion are haemorrhagic (eg, 
33.5% in those 20–44 years vs 23.1% in those 
45–54 years).13 Haemorrhagic strokes in those aged 
20–44 years are subarachnoid or intracerebral in 
approximately equal proportion.13 In young people, 
subarachnoid haemorrhages are most frequently 
due to an underlying cerebral aneurysm or arte-
riovenous malformation (AVM).14 Non-traumatic 
intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is associated with 
hypertension in 70% of all-age stroke, but in young 
people it may account for as little as 20%, with a 
high preponderance of other causes such as AVM, 
ruptured saccular aneurysm and sympathomimetic 
drug use.15
Risk factors for ischaemic stroke include dyslip-
idaemia, smoking and hypertension.16 17 As is the 
case for haemorrhagic stroke causation differs in 
young people (<45 years), with a higher prepon-
derance of females, recent illicit substance use and 
use of the contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives 
than in those even slightly older (45–49 years).17
substance use and stroke in young people
The prevalence of illicit drug use is highest among 
younger people.9 18 19 There is increased relative risk 
for both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke asso-
ciated with all drug use20 and drug use as a cause 
of stroke is significantly more common among 
young people.17 Intravenous use of any illicit drug 
increases the risk of ischaemic stroke through 
thromboembolic mechanisms.21 Stroke risk factors 
are different among users of illicit substances, 
with higher rates of smoking and lower rates of

cerebrovascular disease
hypertension and diabetes compared with those with ischaemic 
stroke in the absence of substance use.21 Alcohol has also been 
demonstrated to increase risk of stroke.17
One class of drugs that has been associated with stroke inci-
dence is the psychostimulants.11 Cocaine, in particular, has been 
associated with a substantially increased risk of haemorrhagic 
stroke.11 Methamphetamine shares pharmacological charac-
teristics and physiological effects in common with cocaine, 
and both are associated with hypertension and coronary 
disease.5 7 22 23 Methamphetamine, however, has a longer half-
life than cocaine,7 and there is subsequently a longer exposure 
to systemic hypertension. Moreover, methamphetamine also 
substantially increases the risk of stroke.24–26 It is important to 
note that methamphetamine is also strongly associated with the 
development of ischaemic heart disease and accelerated athero-
sclerotic coronary artery disease.7
Despite its widespread use and potential clinical significance, 
however, the features and pathogenesis of methamphetamine-re-
lated stroke are poorly understood. This is of particular relevance 
in a period of large increases in worldwide methamphetamine 
use, when the incidence of methamphetamine-related stroke, 
particularly among young people, would be expected to increase 
in conjunction with use. In the context of increased use of meth-
amphetamine, and thus of increased stroke risk, the current 
study aimed to review the literature on methamphetamine-re-
lated stroke among young people (defined as <45 years). Specif-
ically, the study aimed to:
1. summarise the features of stroke in young amphetamine 
users; and
2. determine 
the 
evidence 
for 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
methamphetamine-related stroke.
Methods
The EMBASE (Embase Classic+Embase), MedLine (Ovid 
MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-In-
dexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid MEDLINE and 
Versions) and PsycINFO (PsycINFO) bibliographic databases 
were searched until 10 February 2017 for articles on the asso-
ciation between meth/amphetamine use and strokes in young 
people (figure 1). Search terms included: methamphetamine, 
amphetamine and common variants, stroke, cerebrovascular 
disorders and cerebral haemorrhage. Hand-searching of refer-
ence lists of included studies was also conducted. The search 
was restricted to English-language publications or to those 
with a comprehensive abstract in English that was sufficiently 
detailed. There was no restriction on year of publication. The 
search strategy is provided in detail in the online supplementary 
figure s1.
Inclusion criteria
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published in a 
peer-reviewed journal or referenced in a relevant journal article. 
Studies that focused on the relationship between methamphet-
amine use and incident stroke were included. Where putative 
additional or alternative risk factors for stroke were reported, 
these were detailed (table 1). Consistent with literature on strokes 
in young people,13 17 studies were included if they reported cases 
of methamphetamine/amphetamine-associated stroke in people 
aged 44 years or below. Both ischaemic and haemorrhagic 
strokes were considered. Studies were included only where the 
drug was used for abuse purposes, excluding studies reporting 
effects of prescribed amphetamines and related compounds. 
Where polydrug use was recorded, this was documented where 
relevant. Dextroamphetamine was included only where it was 
used for abuse purposes.
results
A total of 77 papers met search criteria (figure 1). These 
comprised three postmortem studies, 11 case control and epide-
miological studies and 63 case series/case reports.
Methamphetamine-related stroke in young people: 
postmortem studies
Several large postmortem series report that between 1% and 5% 
of all-age methamphetamine-related deaths are caused by intra-
cranial haemorrhage, with cases of both subarachnoid and ICH 
reported27–29 (table 2).
Methamphetamine-related stroke in young people: 
epidemiological studies
Case series conducted over the past four decades identify amphet-
amines as a cause of stroke in 6%–13% of haemorrhagic15 20 30–32 
and 2%–6% of ischaemic stroke16 21 (table 3). These differences 
reflect rates of use in the area the study was undertaken, and 
change in use patterns over time. It is noteworthy that higher 
rates of stroke associated with methamphetamine were recorded 
in the past decade, with three studies of haemorrhagic stroke32–34 
reporting rates of methamphetamine use between 7% and 13%, 
despite these series being in all-age populations. Because meth-
amphetamine use is predominantly associated with younger age, 
the proportion of methamphetamine-associated strokes in these 
series among those <45 
years (though unreported) is likely to 
be even higher. Similarly, Phillips and coworkers’16 case series 
of ischaemic stroke among individuals aged 15–50 
years reports 
a higher rate due to amphetamine (6%) than the 2% identified 
in a study conducted a decade earlier.21 In addition, it is likely 
that drug use as a contributory cause may often be underesti-
mated, as suitable investigations or testing for drug use may not 
be conducted or recorded.

cerebrovascular disease
Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated a signifi-
cantly increased risk of stroke among young meth/amphetamine 
users.24 25 Westover and coworkers25 conducted separate anal-
yses for haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke. Amphetamine 
use was significantly associated with a 4.95 increased risk of 
haemorrhagic stroke, a risk more than twice that conferred by 
either cocaine or tobacco use. The authors also noted a dramatic 
increase in the rate of amphetamine-associated stroke over 
the 3-year timeframe of their study, which was greater than 
the rate of increase in strokes associated with any other illicit 
drug. Consistent with these findings, Huang and coworkers26 
compared stroke events in a large cohort of methamphet-
amine users of all ages and found significantly increased risk of 
haemorrhagic stroke among methamphetamine users, but not of 
ischaemic stroke.

administration, with an oral to injection to inhalation ratio of 
3:3:1. Methamphetamine-related stroke was thus not solely 
associated with a particular route of administration. Headache 
was a prominent early clinical feature, with vomiting, one-sided 
weakness and seizures often developing over time. ICHs were 
present in 60 cases, predominantly in the temporal, parietal 
and occipital cortices. Less common sites were the cerebellum 
(two) and brainstem (three). There were 32 cases of subarach-
noid haemorrhage (SAH), among whom 13 had both ICH and 
SAH. Intraventricular haemorrhage was present in five cases, but 
only in one case in the absence of ICH. Aneurysms and AVMs 
were present in 17% and 8%, 
respectively. Other vasculature 
abnormalities were reported in a third of cases, most commonly 
beading of vessel wall or cerebral arteritis with or without occlu-
sive changes in the small arteries. Irregularities of the vessel 
lumen were present in a minority of cases. No abnormality of 
vasculature was found in less than half of cases (47%).
Haemorrhagic stroke resulted in death in a third of cases. 
Complete recovery was reported in one quarter and the 
remainder (approximately 40%) had residual symptoms ranging 
from mild weakness and memory difficulties, to permanent 
hemiparesis, speech and language difficulties and visual defects.
Ischaemic stroke
Of the 17 ischaemic strokes, the male to female ratio was 12:5. 
The route of administration differed notably from haemorrhagic 
stroke with a higher preponderance of inhalational use (the 
oral:injection:inhalation ratio was 1:1:4). Again, these strokes 
occurred across all routes of administration. Headache was 
again the predominant early presenting feature, with hyperten-
sion frequently reported. Ischaemic strokes were predominantly 
located in regions whose blood supply derives from the ante-
rior circulation: the frontal and parietal lobes and/or the basal 
ganglia. A minority were located in the occipital lobe or caudal 
thalamus indicating a posterior circulation infarction. One case 
extended from frontal to occipital lobes, suggestive of involve-
ment of both anterior and posterior circulations. Of note, Philips 
and coworkers16 found that methamphetamine use was signifi-
cantly more common among individuals aged 15–50 years with 
stroke involving both vascular territories compared with their 
whole study population. Angiography was less commonly 
conducted in ischaemic stroke cases. Where performed, beading 
suggestive of arteritis was present in three cases and intimal wall 
thickening in one. No abnormality was detected in four cases, 
which was interpreted by some authors as suggestive that vaso-
spasm may have been the cause, due to absence of any permanent 
vessel occlusion.33 Other causes of infarction included bacterial 
embolus (one case) and thrombus from carotid artery dissection 
(two cases).
The outcome was death in approximately 20% of cases. 
Complete recovery was achieved in a further 20%. The majority 
of cases (approximately 60%), however, experienced residual 
impairments such as hemiparesis, speech and visual deficits.
dIscussIon
This review highlights the preponderance of haemorrhagic 
rather than ischaemic strokes associated with methamphetamine 
use in young people. In case reports and series, 80% of metham-
phetamine-related strokes reported were haemorrhagic. This is 
strikingly high compared with reported rates of haemorrhagic 
stroke in stroke populations below 45 
years (40%–55%) and 
higher again than in the general stroke population (15%–20%).12 
Thus it is possible that this may to some extent reflect reporting 
bias. Thus, it is possible that instances of young individuals expe-
riencing haemorrhagic stroke associated with methamphetamine 
use may be more likely to be reported, and the resultant case 
study published, than is the case for ischaemic stroke. Both isch-
aemic and haemorrhagic strokes occur in young people. While 
haemorrhagic strokes are relatively more common than in older 
stroke populations, ischaemic strokes remain more common 
than haemorrhagic even in young people.13 Alternatively, it may 
be that the cases reported reflect the number of cases occur-
ring. Moreover, the finding is in keeping with population-based 
evidence that methamphetamine use is associated with a highly 
increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke among individuals aged 
18–44 
years.25 A significantly increased preponderance of haem-
orrhagic compared with ischaemic strokes was found in several 
stroke case series.26 35 While the ratios were less stark than the 
4:1 reported here, both studies considered all-age populations 
(in which ischaemia would be expected to be more prominent), 
rather than young adults. Furthermore, the cerebrovascular 
pathology reported here must be viewed within the context 
of a range of known methamphetamine-related cardiovascular 
pathologies, including accelerated atherosclerosis, ischaemic 
heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, various cardiomyop-
athies, arrhythmias, cardiomegaly and aortic dissection.7 8 22 23 26
Individual and use-related characteristics
In keeping with previous reports,34 this review highlights that 
strokes can occur following any route of methamphetamine 
administration. Haemorrhagic strokes occurred following 
oral or intravenous use in similar numbers. Stroke may result 
following injection of any drug due to increased risk of bacterial 
endocarditis and embolism, or due to the use of fillers such as 
talc, which may contribute to both ischaemic and haemorrhagic 
stroke.36 Injecting alone, however, does not explain all strokes. 
In these cases, it is use of methamphetamine that confers the 
risk. The proportions of strokes due to oral, injecting or inha-
lational routes may reflect general use prevalence of the drug, 
but it is noteworthy that starkly different use patterns exist 
between ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes, with a relatively 
higher proportion of ischaemic strokes associated with inhala-
tion. Methamphetamine-associated stroke was less common in 
women than men, which may reflect the 3:1 ratio of use patterns 
in the general population, and/or other risk factors for stroke in 
this age population.15 17 Many studies did not report additional 
risk factors for stroke in the affected individuals, suggesting that 
in this young population haemorrhagic strokes in particular were 
related primarily to methamphetamine use. However, the pres-
ence of other undetected or unreported risk factors cannot be 
excluded. In the ischaemic stroke literature, other risk factors 
for stroke were detailed in some cases (table 1). It is notable 
that several young people were reported to have resting hyper-
tension, which may or may not been a consequence of chronic 
methamphetamine use.
Where methamphetamine use has directly led to a stroke, 
headache, nausea, vomiting and confusion (and sometimes 
motor and sensory neurological signs) are early symptoms of 
stroke that will typically onset within minutes to hours of taking 
the drug.37 Hypertension is more often detected when medical 
support is sought quickly, presumably due to the effects of the 
drug still being present. The time from most recent use to onset 
of symptoms (or help-seeking for these) varied widely between 
studies from hours to weeks. It is likely that this range of use 
histories and use-to-stroke intervals is explained by different 
mechanisms of action of methamphetamine-associated stroke

cerebrovascular disease
that include hypertension, vasculitis, direct vascular toxicity and 
vasospasm.38
Pathogenesis of haemorrhagic stroke
Intracranial haemorrhage may occur secondary to methamphet-
amine-induced hypertension and tachycardia, even in the absence 
of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease.39 Transient increases in 
blood pressure caused by methamphetamine through its direct 
action as a sympathomimetic agent may lead to ICH. Repeated 
use can raise blood pressure, increasing the risk for stroke, even 
in those without baseline hypertension.40 As is the case in essen-
tial hypertension, intracranial haemorrhage risk is increased by 
vessel wall damage that increases the likelihood of subsequent 
rupture and haemorrhage, particularly during an acute stress 
such as methamphetamine use.35
Chronic use can cause long-term systemic hypertension,5 7 a 
major risk factor for stroke. Both methamphetamine and cocaine 
contribute to physiological vascular fatigue by their pharmaco-
logical actions of hypertension and tachycardia.41 The more 
prolonged cardiovascular effect of methamphetamine compared 
with cocaine41 is a possible explanation for increased rates of 
ICH in methamphetamine abuse compared with cocaine.25 
Vascular fatigue in a berry aneurysm leads to rupture and, often, 
to death. Furthermore, because vascular fatigue is cumulative, 
chronic previous methamphetamine use may be a significant 
factor in the development of berry aneurysms.41 McEvoy and 
coworkers42 suggest that cerebral aneurysms may form acutely 
in response to hypertensive crisis and or vasculitis induced by 
methamphetamine use.
Methamphetamine-induced subarachnoid haemorrhage in 
the absence of berry aneurysm or AVM can occur associated 
with necrotising angiitis.43–47 Methamphetamine is believed to 
directly affect the integrity of vasculature, giving rise to fibri-
noid necrosis of the intima and media of blood vessel walls 
and destruction of their vascular smooth muscle predisposing 
to vessel rupture.46 47 Affected vessels are described to have a 
‘beaded’ appearance with segmental narrowing and aneurysm 
formation46 also referred to as cerebral arteritis. Angiography 
and tissue microscopic examination have identified these abnor-
malities following intravenous,43 44 48 oral45 49 and inhalational 
use.50 In some cases, where angiography was repeated several 
weeks later, these appearances were no longer present51 52 
suggesting that these may be transient abnormalities that remit 
on drug discontinuation or following corticosteroid treatment.53 
Cerebral vasculitis is not specific to meth/amphetamine and is 
associated with the abuse of other illicit drugs, including cocaine 
and heroin.54 The possibility that methamphetamine may induce 
these changes is supported by animal models that show microan-
eurysm formation, spasm and perivascular cuffing in brains of 
adult Rhesus monkeys following intravenous injection of meth-
amphetamine over 2 
weeks.55
Pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke
Methamphetamine-associated ischaemic strokes may occur by 
various mechanisms. Vasculitis has been demonstrated in several 
young people with cerebral infarction secondary to metham-
phetamine use.50 56 57 Methamphetamine-associated cerebral 
vasculitis and its characteristic arterial narrowing, cerebral artery 
beading and pronounced irregularity of flow50 51 may increase 
the potential for a vessel to become occluded, such as in acute 
vascular spasm, with consequent ischaemia and infarction in the 
brain region supplied by the affected vessel.50 58 59 Vasospasm 
or cerebral vasoconstriction may follow a rapid rise in blood 
pressure60 and/or direct stimulation by methamphetamine of 
sympathomimetic α-adrenergic and β-adrenergic receptors, with 
resultant ischaemia.61
In a large case series of 30 all-age methamphetamine related 
stroke, however, Ho and coworkers35 found no evidence of an 
inflammatory vasculitic process underlying ischaemic stroke. 
Rather, they concluded that methamphetamine-associated vessel 
damage may occur as a result of accelerated atherosclerosis. 
Methamphetamine increases both systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures. Repeated exposure to transient use-related hyper-
tension or the development of chronic hypertension in habitual 
methamphetamine users exposes individuals to heightened risk 
of arteriosclerosis pathogenesis, and associated arterial weak-
ness, many years prematurely compared with the general popu-
lation. Methamphetamine may also increase the risk of stroke 
through the highly increased risk of cardiomyopathy, and with 
that an increased risk of arrhythmias and thrombosis, leading to 
thromboembolic strokes.
As is the case for haemorrhagic stroke, methamphetamine-in-
duced ischaemic stroke may occur in the absence of evidence 
of cerebral vascular abnormalities, chronic hypertension62 or 
other stroke risk factors.63 Other reports, however, indicate 
that patients with methamphetamine-associated stroke do carry 
additional risk factors for stroke including smoking, alcohol, 
hyperlipidaemia and AVM.62 64 65 Lifestyle factors associated 
with methamphetamine use including smoking and alcohol are 
likely to increase risk of stroke development as may additional 
common risk factors such as stroke history in either parent,66 
dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus.17
Prognosis and outcomes
This review demonstrated that complete recovery was achieved 
in less than a quarter of cases. One-third of haemorrhagic 
strokes and one quarter of ischaemic strokes resulted in death. 
The remainder of individuals suffered a range of disability. It is 
likely that minor transient cerebrovascular events that resolve 
spontaneously would not result in help-seeking in this popula-
tion, so the cases reported in the literature may reflect the more 
severe end of the spectrum. Nonetheless, these results compare 
unfavourably with evidence from a recent case series of all-cause 
stroke patients aged 16–45 years in whom an outcome of 
absence of symptoms is achieved by approximately two-thirds 
with a much lower death rate (3%).67 It is well known that 
among young people strokes associated with substance use carry 
a higher mortality.20 There is evidence for methamphetamine-as-
sociated aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage that clinical 
outcomes are worse than age-matched controls at discharge30 
and at 1-year and 3-year follow-up.31
clinical implications
This review highlights the heightened risk of haemorrhagic 
stroke associated with methamphetamine use. With the use of 
methamphetamine increasing, particularly more potent forms, 
there is a growing burden of methamphetamine-related disease 
and harms, particularly among young people, in whom the 
majority of methamphetamine use occurs. Indeed, it is likely that 
methamphetamine abuse is making a disproportionate contribu-
tion to the increased incidence of stroke among young people 
observed over recent years.12 25
Clinicians treating methamphetamine users, and users them-
selves, need to be aware of the elevated risk of stroke in young 
methamphetamine users and to be aware of early signs and 
symptoms. Of note, symptoms such as paraesthesiae, headache,

cerebrovascular disease
speech and language difficulties and visual defects, may be 
experienced transiently as a result of vasospasm, for example, 
and may herald later experience of a catastrophic stroke event. 
Conversely, young people presenting with signs and symptoms 
of stoke may well be methamphetamine users, highlighting the 
need for illicit drug use to be investigated as a contributory 
cause. A thorough substance use history should be sought and 
toxicological screening of urine and serum performed in young 
people presenting with stroke. This review focused on illicit 
amphetamine use and the data relating to stroke associated with 
prescribed amphetamines is beyond its scope. The possibility 
of increased stroke risk related to prescribed amphetamines 
for conditions such as attention deficit disorder is important 
and has been reviewed elsewhere.68 Similarly, the therapeutic 
use of amphetamines in stroke recovery has been systemati-
cally reviewed and found to be associated with increased death 
compared with control groups.69 Due consideration should be 
given to these risks when contemplating treatment options in 
young people.
The increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke in particular should 
be highlighted to young people who may use methamphetamine 
and to their communities in order to ensure appropriate help 
seeking, detection and intervention. Increasing the number of 
methamphetamine users in treatment appears to be a priority. 
There are no proven pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine 
dependence,70 but long-term residential rehabilitation has been 
shown to reduce methamphetamine use and harm.71
conclusIons
There is a preponderance of haemorrhagic strokes associated 
with methamphetamine use in young people, and methamphet-
amine-related stroke is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. 
Mechanisms of methamphetamine-associated stroke include 
hypertension, vasculitis, direct vascular toxicity and vasospasm. 
In a period of rising worldwide methamphetamine use, the inci-
dence of methamphetamine-related stroke will increase, with a 
consequent increase in the burden of disease contributed by such 
events.
