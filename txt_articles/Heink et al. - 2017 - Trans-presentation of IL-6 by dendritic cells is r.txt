Abstract
The cellular sources of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that are relevant for the differentiation of TH17 cells 
remain unclear. Here, we used a novel strategy of IL-6 conditional deletion of distinct IL-6-
producing cell types to show that Sirpα+ dendritic cells (DC) were essential for the generation of 
pathogenic TH17 cells. During the process of cognate interaction, Sirpα+ DCs trans-presented 
IL-6 to T cells using their own IL-6Rα. While ambient IL-6 was sufficient to suppress the 
induction of the transcription factor Foxp3 in T cells, IL-6 trans-presentation by DC-bound 
IL-6Rα (here defined as IL-6 cluster signaling) was required to prevent premature induction of 
IFN-γ in T cells and to generate pathogenic TH17 cells in vivo. These findings will guide 
therapeutic approaches for TH17-mediated autoimmune diseases.
During antigen-specific priming, CD4+ T helper (TH) cells differentiate into distinct subsets 
characterized by specific master transcription factors and signature cytokines. The 
differentiation process is controlled by various cytokines present in the micro-environment, 
in which CD4+ T cells cognately interact with antigen presenting cells. Because T cell 
receptor (TCR) stimulation in the presence of the ubiquitously expressed cytokine TGF-β 
results in induction of the transcription factor Foxp3, productive effector T cell responses 
require efficient ways to suppress Foxp3 induction in T cells during priming. Although 
interleukin 27 (IL-27) has additional regulatory functions 1, IL-27 and IL-4 are strong 
inhibitors of Foxp3 induction during the development of TH1 cells and TH2 cells, 
respectively 2–4. During TH17 cell development, IL-6 prevents the transcription of Foxp3 
and at the same time induces IL-17 5,6. However, it is unclear whether these functions of 
IL-6 are connected with each other or are independent events.
TH17 cells are categorized into pathogenic vs non-pathogenic depending on whether or not 
they have sensed IL-23 7,8. However, single cell analysis of TH17 cells isolated from the 
inflamed CNS reveals that individual TH17 cells can exibit a non-pathogenic gene signature 
including transcription factors (Eomes, Irf8, c-Maf), cytokines (Il24, Il9) and surface 
receptors (Cxcr6 and Cd96) although they express Il23r 9. Thus, the decision of whether a 
TH17 cell will become pathogenic can be taken independently of IL-23 and might be 
installed early during priming.
Because IL-6 is the dominant factor to initiate the transcriptional program of TH17 cells, we 
speculated that intrinsic properties of IL-6 might be a major determinant of priming 
pathogenic T cells. In order to signal into target cells, IL-6 first binds to the IL-6Rα subunit. 
This complex then associates with gp130, the signaling subunit of the IL-6 receptor, 
resulting in a heterohexameric signaling complex (IL-6, IL-6Rα, gp130 in a 2:2:2 
stoichiometry) that triggers productive IL-6 signaling into the target cell 10,11. In addition to 
the membrane form, IL-6Rα can be shed and bind IL-6 as a soluble receptor. The IL-6-
sIL-6Rα soluble complex associates with gp130 and initiates IL-6 signaling in gp130+ cells. 
This type of IL-6 signaling is termed IL-6 trans-signaling 12,13. In contrast to classic IL-6

 signaling, IL-6 trans-signaling can be blocked by soluble gp130 which acts as a decoy 
receptor for the soluble IL-6-IL-6Ra complex 14.
Here, in order to investigate whether the cellular source of IL-6 was a determinant of TH17 
cell fate, we developed a novel IL-6 reporter strategy that allowed for the IL-6 conditional 
deletion of distinct cell types. We show that a subset of CD11b+ DCs that are Sirpα+ are 
indispensable for priming of myelin peptide specific encephalitogenic T cells. Our data 
indicate that CD11b+Sirpα+ DCs are able to trans-present IL-6 through a complex 
containing DC-expressed IL-6Rα bound to IL-6 that can interact with gp130 expressed on T 
cells. We define this mode of IL-6 signaling as ‘cluster signaling’ and propose that 
imprinting of encephalitogenic properties in effector T cells is dependent on IL-6 cluster 
signaling, while classic IL-6 signaling through its membrane bound receptor complex is 
sufficient to suppress the TGF-β-induced expression of Foxp3, but fails to prime pathogenic 
TH17 cells.
Results
DCs are the relevant source of IL-6 for priming pathogenic TH17 cells
Because IL-6 is produced by different hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, we sought 
to define the relevant cellular source of IL-6 for the differentiation of pathogenic TH17 cells. 
We generated an IL-6 reporter knock-in allele (Il6RD), in which IL-6 expression is reported 
by cerulean and Thy1.1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, the reporter contains 
a floxed stop cassette that allows a cell type-specific expression of the reporter cassette 
depending on the Cre driver used in various mouse strains. First, we crossed Il6RD/wt mice 
with a CMV-Cre deleter strain to allow for unrestricted expression of the IL-6 reporter 
cassette and immunized these mice with MOG35-55 in CFA. On day 7 after immunization, 
Thy1.1 (IL-6) was exclusively produced by CD45+ hematopoietic cells in draining lymph 
node cells and spleen of CMV-Cre x Il6RD/wt mice. CD11c+ cells contained the largest 
frequencies of Thy1.1 (IL-6)+ cells (Fig. 1a). Subgroup analysis revealed that Thy1.1 (IL-6) 
expression was restricted to CD11b+Sirpα+CD103-SiglecH- DCs (Supplementary Fig. 2). In 
draining lymph nodes, some DCs were Thy1.1+ already on the first day after immunization 
with MOG35-55 in CFA. The subset of Thy1.1+ DCs was maintained at least through day 6 
after immunization (Fig. 1b). At the peak of EAE (day 16 post immunization), Thy1.1+ cells 
in the CNS were mainly CD45+CD11b+ myeloid cells (Fig. 1c). Nevertheless, and in 
contrast to the peripheral immune compartment, a substantial fraction of IL-6 in the CNS 
appeared to be produced by non-hematopoietic cells. Importantly, specific ablation of IL-6-
producing DCs in CD11c-Cre x Il6RD/wt mice using an anti-Thy1.1 antibody 
(Supplementary Fig. 2) resulted in the priming of MOG35-55-specific T cells with reduced 
IL-17 and increased IFN-γ production (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 3) and abrogated the 
development of EAE (Fig. 1e). These data suggested that either IL-6 production by DCs or 
the physical presence of IL-6-producing DCs were required for the induction of EAE. In 
order to discriminate between these possibilities, we conditionally deleted Il6 in DCs using 
CD11c-Cre and Il6flox alleles. Loss of Il6 in dendritic cells in CD11c-Cre x Il6flox/flox mice, 
herein called Il6ΔDC, resulted in complete resistance to EAE, despite the continued presence 
of CD11b+Sirpα+ DCs in these mice (Fig. 1f). Indeed, Il6ΔDC mice phenocopied Il6-/- mice

 in their resistance to EAE. Apart from DCs, some Thy1.1 (IL-6) was expressed by T cells, B 
cells and macrophages (Fig. 1a). Conditional deletion of Il6 in these cells modulated disease 
severity, but did not abrogate EAE development (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, DC-derived 
IL-6 is essential for priming pathogenic T cell responses in EAE.
DC derived IL-6 is sensed by interacting T cells in a specific manner
Our data would be consistent with the idea that DC-derived IL-6 acted back on DCs in an 
autocrine manner to boost their ability to prime pathogenic TH17 cells. However, no major 
differences in the induction of Il1b, Il12 or Il23 were observed between wild-type and 
IL-6Rα-deficient BMDCs, which cannot respond to soluble IL-6, upon exposure to 
exogenous IL-6 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, we explored alternative modes of action of 
DC-derived IL-6 during cognate interaction with T cells. Naive (Foxp3-) CD4+ T cells from 
2D2 x Foxp3gfp.KI mice , which express a MOG35-55-specific transgenic TCR and in which 
Foxp3 expression is reported by GFP, were transferred into Il6flox/flox control, Il6-/- or 
Il6ΔDC mice followed by subcutaneous immunization with MOG35-55 in CFA. As previously 
reported 15, priming of transgenic T cells in an IL-6-deficient environment in the Il6-/- mice 
resulted in the conversion of about 20% 2D2 T cells into GFP (Foxp3)+ Treg cells (Fig. 2a). 
In contrast, we did not observe conversion of GFP- 2D2 T cells into GFP+ 2D2 T cells 
during priming of naive 2D2 T cells in the Il6ΔDC mice, indicating that IL-6 from sources 
other than DCs was sufficient to suppress the conversion of conventional T cells into Foxp3+ 
Treg cells during antigen specific priming. Indeed, the systemic amount of IL-6 measured in 
the serum after subcutaneous immunization with MOG35-55 peptide in CFA was similar in 
Il6flox/flox and Il6ΔDC animals (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Although the emergence of Foxp3+ Treg cells was equally suppressed in Il6ΔDC as in IL-6-
sufficient (Il6flox/flox) mice, Il6flox/flox mice developed EAE following immunization with 
MOG35-55 in CFA, while Il6ΔDC mice did not (Fig. 1f). Thus, to search for effector T cell-
intrinsic features that would explain the inability of Il6ΔDC primed T cells to induce EAE, 
we performed RNA sequencing analysis of GFP (Foxp3)- 2D2 T cells that were re-isolated 
from the draining lymph nodes of Il6flox/flox, Il6-/- or Il6ΔDC mice on day 6 after 
immunization with MOG35-55 in CFA. The set of genes differentially expressed in 2D2 T 
cells isolated from Il6-/- vs Il6flox/flox control mice was defined as IL-6 target genes 
(Supplementary Table 1). Within this set, we identified those genes enriched in 2D2 T cells 
primed in Il6ΔDC vs Il6flox/flox mice (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) and analyzed 
upstream pathways compatible with this enrichment by ingenuity pathway analysis 
(Supplementary Fig. 6). We found that differential activation of Stat3 was the major 
predictor of the distinct gene enrichment profiles of 2D2 T cells primed in Il6ΔDC vs 
Il6flox/flox (Supplementary Fig. 6). Moreover, when we directly tested a published Stat3 
dependent gene set 16, Stat3 target genes were enriched in 2D2 T cells primed in Il6flox/flox 
over Il6ΔDC mice (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 4). Thus, we tested the 
activation of Stat3 in T cells in Il6flox/flox, Il6-/- or Il6ΔDC mice. Naive 2D2 T cells were co-
cultured with Il6flox/flox, Il6-/- or Il6ΔDC splenocytes in the presence of cognate antigen 
(MOG35-55). After LPS stimulation, Stat3 activation was negligible in T cells cultured with 
Il6-/- APCs. Stat3 activation was delayed in T cells primed with Il6ΔDC APCs compared to 
wild-type APC-primed T cells (Fig. 2c) despite similar amounts of soluble IL-6 in the

 supernatant of wild-type APC-T cell and Il6ΔDC APC-T cell co-cultures (Fig. 2d). Thus, 
IL-6 induced an early and robust activation of Stat3 in antigen-specific 2D2 T cells only 
when provided by DCs.
In addition, because the in vivo priming of 2D2 T cells in Il6ΔDC mice resulted in a highly 
efficient suppression of Foxp3 induction (Fig. 2a), we investigated whether activation of 
Stat3 had differential effects on the IL-6-mediated suppression of Foxp3 expression and the 
induction of effector properties in conventional T cells. Naive CD44-CD25-CD4+ T cells 
from Stat3flox/flox control mice or CD4-Cre x Stat3flox/flox mice (Stat3ΔT) were activated in 
vitro with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of TGF-β without and with IL-6 
followed by assessment of Foxp3 induction and effector cytokines. As expected, Stat3 was 
indispensable for the induction of IL-17 (Fig. 2e). However, Stat3 deficient T cells produced 
high amounts of IFN-γ when differentiated under TH17 conditions (Fig. 2e, f). The TGF-β-
induced expression of Foxp3 was (at least in part) suppressed by IL-6 in Stat3 deficient T 
cells (Fig. 2e, f), indicating that lack of Stat3 in T cells resulted in a TH1-like phenotype 
under TH17 differentiation conditions. In summary, these data suggest that T cells can 
distinguish between DC-derived IL-6 and IL-6 from other sources due to different Stat3 
activation kinetics translating into different T cell phenotypes.
IL-6 cluster signaling is an efficient signaling mode
Besides classic IL-6 signaling through soluble IL-6 (sIL-6) binding to its membrane-bound 
receptor, soluble IL-6Rα-IL-6 complexes engage gp130 on target cells that lack IL-6Rα, a 
process called IL-6 trans-signaling 13. We tested whether during a cognate DC-T cell 
encounter, DC-bound IL-6Rα trans-presents DC-derived IL-6 to T cells through a distinct 
IL-6 trans-presentation process, which requires the clustering of donating and receiving cell 
- hence named here IL-6 cluster signaling. First, we established the functionality of IL-6 
cluster signaling by retrovirally expressing either IL-6Rα (without eGFP) or gp130-eGFP in 
Ba/F3 cells, an IL-3-dependent murine pro-B-cell line that lacks both endogenous IL-6Rα 
and gp130 expression 17,18, followed by testing their proliferative response to IL-6 
signaling (Fig. 3a). While in separate cultures, Ba/F3-IL-6Rα cells, which lacked gp130, did 
not proliferate in response to either sIL-6 or a sIL-6-soluble IL-6Rα complex (hereafter 
hyper-IL-6 19) (Fig. 3a), Ba/F3-gp130-eGFP cells, which lacked IL-6Rα, proliferated in 
response to hyper-IL-6, but not sIL-6 (Fig. 3a), suggesting that hyper-IL-6 formed a 
functional signaling complex with membrane bound gp130-eGFP in Ba/F3-gp130-eGFP 
cells. Notably, when Ba/F3-gp130-eGFP cells were co-cultured with Ba/F3-IL-6Rα cells, 
sIL-6 alone induced the proliferation of Ba/F3-gp130-eGFP cells (Fig. 3b, c), suggesting 
that Ba/F3-IL-6Rα cells trans-presented IL-6 to Ba/F3-gp130-eGFP cells, inducing the 
proliferation of the latter cells. This IL-6 cluster signaling requires the clustering of Ba/F3-
IL-6Rα cells and Ba/F3-gp130-eGFP cells in the same co-culture. Exogenous IL-6Rα Abs, 
but not soluble gp130 (sgp130-Fc), a strong inhibitor of IL-6 trans-signaling by hyper-IL-6, 
neutralized IL-6 cluster signaling (Fig. 3b), indicating that IL-6 trans-signaling and IL-6 
cluster signaling are functionally different. Together, these results suggest that IL-6 bound to 
IL-6Rα on the surface of IL-6Rα-expressing cells signals through membrane-bound gp130 
in cells that do not express IL-6Rα when both cell types are in physical proximity.

 DCs present IL-6 in trans and induce IL-6 cluster signaling
Next, we tested the ability of DCs to present IL-6 in trans during a cognate interaction with 
T cells (Supplementary Fig. 7). Naive (CD4+CD44-GFP (Foxp3)-) 2D2 T cells were co-
cultured with BMDCs in the presence of cognate antigen (MOG35-55) and LPS to induce 
IL-6 production in BMDCs. GFP (Foxp3)- effector 2D2 T cells showed robust Stat3 
activation assessed by flow cytometry when they were co-cultured with wild-type BMDCs, 
but not after culture with Il6ra-/- BMDCs, although the amount of soluble IL-6 produced by 
wild-type and Il6ra-/- BMDCs was similar (Fig. 4a, b). To test if IL-6 cluster signaling 
occurred during cognate DC-T cell interactions, we co-cultured wild-type BMDCs with 
naive T cells isolated either from wild-type or CD4-Cre x Il6raflox/flox (Il6raΔT) mice, and 
used Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), a superantigen that activates TCR-Vβ8+ T cells in 
an MHC class II dependent manner 20. TCR-Vβ8+ T cells exhibited an increased p-Stat3 
signal compared to TCR-Vβ8- T cells present in the same culture (Fig. 4c). In addition, 
Stat3 activation occurred in both wild-type and Il6raΔT TCR-Vβ8+ T cells. In contrast, 
exogenous soluble IL-6 induced p-Stat3 in wild-type, but not by Il6raΔT T cells (Fig. 4c). In 
addition, when MOG35-55-specific transgenic 2D2 T cells and OVA323-339-specific 
transgenic OT II T cells where co-cultured with wild-type BMDCs in a triple culture, early 
Stat3 phosphorylation was exclusively observed in T cells whose cognate antigen was 
present in the culture but not in co-cultured T cells with irrelevant specificity (Fig. 4d, e), 
suggesting that IL-6 cluster signaling did not result in bystander activation of T cells that did 
not interact with DCs in a cognate manner.
In order to further characterize IL-6 cluster signaling during a DC-T cell interaction, we 
used a variety of IL-6 blocking reagents at the time of LPS activation of BMDCs co-cultured 
with 2D2 T cells in the presence of MOG35-55. The monoclonal antibody MR16-1, which 
binds IL-6Rα, completely abolished the p-Stat3 signal in 2D2 T cells (Fig. 4f). In contrast, 
sgp130-Fc did not inhibit p-Stat3 in 2D2 T cells (Fig. 4f), indicating that sgp130-Fc cannot 
engage the membrane bound IL-6-IL-6Rα complex interacting with gp130 in trans. In 
addition, antibodies to IL-6, and in particular mAb #8, a monoclonal IL-6 antibody that 
binds the interaction site between IL-6 and IL-6Rα 10, failed to block Stat3 activation in T 
cells in response to LPS activated co-cultured BMDCs (Fig. 4f). Because IL-6 bound in a 
complex with IL-6Rα would be less easily neutralized by IL-6 antibodies, we tested whether 
IL-6 was loaded onto the IL-6Rα in the intracellular compartment and transported to the cell 
membrane of DCs as a complex. We incubated equal mixtures of Il6ra-/- and wild-type 
BMDCs or Il6ra-/- and Il6-/- BMDCs with naive (CD44-GFP (Foxp3)-) 2D2 T cells in the 
presence of MOG35-55 and stimulated the cultures with LPS. Within 120 min after LPS 
stimulation, Il6ra-/- + wild-type BMDCs elicited Stat3 activation in GFP (Foxp3)- effector T 
cells comparable to wild-type BMDCs alone, while Il6ra-/- + Il6-/- BMDCs failed to induce 
p-STAT3, similar to Il6ra-/- BMDCs alone (Fig. 4g), indicating that Il6-/- BMDCs, which 
express IL-6Rα, do not pick up ambient IL-6 supplied by Il6ra-/- BMDCs and do not trans-
present ambient IL-6 to T cells. Notably, there was no clustered IL-6 feedback Stat3 signal 
into any of the BMDCs present in the co-cultures but only a smoldering Stat3 activation in 
BMDCs beyond 120 min of LPS stimulation (Fig. 4h). The late p-Stat3 activation in 
BMDCs was higher in the Il6ra-/- + wild-type BMDC co-cultures than in the Il6ra-/- + Il6-/- 
BMDC co-cultures (Fig. 4h), suggesting that higher amounts of soluble IL-6 in the Il6ra-/- +

 wild-type BMDC co-cultures (data not shown) were responsible for classic IL-6 signaling 
into BMDCs. Taken together, DCs load IL-6 onto IL-6Rα in their intracellular compartment 
and use the IL-6-IL-6Rα complex to perform IL-6 cluster signaling when cognately 
interacting with T cells. IL-6 cluster signaling then leads to the targeted activation of Stat3 in 
antigen specific T cells but not in bystander T cells.
IL-6 and IL-6Rα co-localize in DCs
Next, we used confocal microscopy to visualize IL-6-IL-6Rα complexes in BMDCs that 
interacted with 2D2 T cells in a cognate manner. BMDCs were co-cultured with 2D2 T cells 
in the presence of MOG35-55 and stimulated with LPS in the absence of exogenous IL-6. We 
detected "clustered" IL-6 on the surface of LPS-stimulated BMDCs interacting with 2D2 T 
cells, with some IL-6 locating at the BMDC-T cell interaction interface (Fig. 5a). To test 
whether IL-6 and IL-6Rα interact on the surface of BMDCs, we performed a proximity 
ligation assay (PLA) 21. IL-6 deficient, IL-6Rα deficient, or wild-type BMDCs were co-
cultured with 2D2 T cells in the presence of MOG35-55 and stimulated with LPS. IL-6 and 
IL-6Rα were simultaneously labeled by antibodies followed by a proximity ligation assay to 
visualize IL-6-IL-6Rα complexes. Positive PLA signals indicating colocalisation of IL-6 
and IL-6Rα at a distance of less than 40 nm were detected in wild-type BMDC-T cell co-
cultures (Fig. 5b) while we observed only few PLA signals in Il6-/- or Il6ra-/- BMDC-T cell 
co-cultures (Fig. 5b, c), suggesting that the background by unspecific PLA amplification 
reactions was low. Co-localization of IL-6 and IL-6Rα occurred in the cytoplasm and at the 
membrane surface of wild-type BMDCs, with some signal localized at the DC-T cell 
interaction zone (see xz-projections in Fig. 5b). Thus, DC-associated IL-6-IL-6Rα 
complexes can be visualized in DCs.
IL-6 cluster signaling during antigen-specific T cell priming in vivo
Next, we analyzed whether lack of DC-mediated IL-6 cluster signaling explained the lack of 
EAE development in Il6ΔDC mice. CD11b+ DCs isolated from the draining lymph nodes of 
MOG35-55-CFA-immunized wild-type mice showed surface and intracellular expression of 
IL-6Rα (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7). In MOG35-55-CFA-immunized CD11c-Cre x 
Il6RD/wt mice, the surface expression of IL-6Rα in Thy1.1+ DCs isolated from the draining 
lymph nodes was higher than in Thy1.1- DCs (Fig. 6b), indicating that DCs that expressed 
IL-6Rα and IL-6 simultaneously can be detected in the draining lymph nodes of immunized 
mice. In order to investigate the requirement for DC mediated IL-6 cluster signaling in the 
priming of pathogenic T cells in vivo, we immunized CD11c-Cre x Il6raflox/flox mice 
(termed Il6raΔDC), which lack IL-6Rα specifically in DCs, and are thus unable to trans-
present IL-6 during antigen specific priming, with MOG35-55 in CFA. Compared to 
Il6raflox/flox control mice, Il6raΔDC mice were resistant to EAE (Fig. 6c). Thus, IL-6 cluster 
signaling is required to promote the differentiation of pathogenic T cells during antigen-
specific priming in a DC proximal manner.
In vivo, sorted naive (CD44-GFP (Foxp3)-) 2D2 T cells, which had been transferred into 
congenic CD45.1 host mice followed by immunization with MOG35-55 in CFA, showed a 
down-regulation of the surface expression of IL-6Rα in the draining lymph nodes as of day 
1 after immunization through at least day 5 when engaged in an antigen specific encounter

 as defined by upregulation of CD69 or CD25, respectively (Fig. 6d). In addition, sgp130-Fc, 
which blocks IL-6 trans-signaling22, did not ameliorate EAE in sgp130-Fc transgenic mice 
as compared to wild-type control animals (Supplementary Fig. 8), indicating that soluble 
IL-6-IL-6Rα complexes are irrelevant in EAE. We next tested whether IL-6Rα-deficient T 
cells could respond to IL-6 cluster signaling by DCs and become pathogenic effector T cells 
by using T cell conditional IL-6Rα-deficient mice (Il6raΔT). We found higher frequencies of 
Foxp3+ Treg cells in the draining lymph node CD4+ T cell compartment of Il6raΔT mice 
immunized with MOG35-55 in CFA compared to Il6raflox/flox control animals while 
MOG35-55 immunized Il6raΔDC mice harbored similar Foxp3+ Treg cell frequencies as 
Il6raflox/flox control mice (Fig. 6e), consistent with the observation that ambient IL-6, and 
thus classic IL-6 signaling, significantly contributes to suppressing the induction of Foxp3+ 
Treg cells from conventional T cells in a polyclonal repertoire. Depletion of Treg cells with 
an anti-CD25 antibody prior to MOG35-55-CFA immunization in Il6raΔT mice lead to an 
increase in the severity of EAE compared to non-Treg cell depleted Il6raΔT mice (Fig. 6f and 
Supplementary Fig. 9), indicating that Il6raΔT TH17 cells could be primed to become 
pathogenic.
Pathogenic TH17 cells can be differentiated with IL-21 in vivo, in the absence of IL-6 15,23. 
To evaluate the contribution of IL-21 in the pathogenic priming of T cells in Il6raΔT mice, 
we adoptively transferred naive polyclonal CD4+ T cells from Il21r-/- x Il6raΔT mice, in 
which T cells are deficient in the expression of both IL-6Rα and IL-21R, into Rag1-/- host 
mice, followed by subcutaneous immunization with MOG35-55 in CFA. Rag1-/- mice 
transferred with Il21r-/- x Il6raΔT T cells mounted a TH17 response in response to MOG35-55 
immunization and developed EAE (Supplementary Fig. 10). Thus, T cells lacking IL-21 
responsiveness and IL-6Rα expression that mediates classic IL-6 signaling can still become 
pathogenic TH17 cells.
Pathogenic TH17 cells are dependent on IL-6 cluster signaling
Il6-/- mice develop an exaggerated Treg cell response upon antigen specific priming with 
adjuvant 15. Because Il6ΔDC mice show normal Foxp3+ Treg responses, but do not develop 
EAE we tested whether effector T cell response in Il6ΔDC mice were intrinsically inefficient. 
Il6flox/flox control mice, Il6-/- and Il6ΔDC mice were sensitized with MOG35-55 in CFA and 
CD4+Foxp3- T cells were isolated from draining lymph nodes for transcriptome analysis. 
Because EAE is essentially a TH17 cell mediated model of CNS autoimmunity, we further 
tested a transcriptional module previously associated with “non-pathogenic” TH17 cells 8 in 
Foxp3- T cells primed in the Il6ΔDC mice. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that 
conventional Foxp3- T cells primed in Il6ΔDC mice had a significantly higher expression of 
Il6st (gp130), Cd96, and Eomes as compared to effector T cells primed in a Il6flox/flox 
control environment (Fig. 7a, b). Notably, CD40L+Foxp3- T cells primed in the Il6ΔDC mice 
and re-stimulated with MOG35-55 in vitro exhibited significantly higher fractions of IFN-γ 
single producers compared to CD40L+ effector T cells primed in Il6flox/flox control mice 
(Fig. 7c), indicating that naïve T cells primed by IL-6 deficient DCs differentiated 
preferentially into CD96+IFN-γ+ T cells, which were incapable of inducing EAE.

 In vitro, hyper-IL-6 suppressed the upregulation of CD96 in IL-6Rα-deficient T cells during 
TH17 differentiation (Fig. 7d), indicating that IL-6 presented in trans was efficient in 
preventing the TGF-β mediated induction of CD96. We used hyper-IL-6 as a surrogate for 
IL-6 presented in trans and compared its effect to soluble IL-6 (and thus classic IL-6 
signaling) during APC free differentiation of naive sorted (CD4+CD44-CD25-) T cells into 
TH17 cells. When using equimolar amounts of soluble IL-6 or hyper-IL-6, the induction of 
IL-17 in T cells was similar with both reagents (Fig. 7e). However, the suppression of IFN-γ 
expression during TH17 differentiation was significantly more efficient with hyper-IL-6 than 
with soluble IL-6 (Fig. 7e). Because under certain conditions, Eomes is an inducer of IFN-γ 
in CD4+ T cells 24,25, we tested whether the increased fraction of IFN-γ+ T cells induced 
by TGF-β plus soluble IL-6 was due to high Eomes expression. During TH17 differentiation, 
Tbx21 and in particular Eomes mRNA were less efficiently suppressed by IL-6 than by 
hyper-IL-6, with no modulation of Rorc (Fig. 7f). Conversely, hyper-IL-6 was significantly 
more potent than soluble IL-6 in inducing robust GFP (IL-23R) expression during in vitro 
TH17 cell differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells isolated from Il23rgfp/+ mice 26 (Fig. 7g, h), 
indicating that the higher IFN-γ expression in T cells primed in Il6ΔDC mice was linked to 
lack of IL-6 trans-presentation in these mice.
Because high IFN-γ expression in myelin-specific-T cells is associated with protection from 
EAE 27, we tested whether the high IFN-γ expression observed in Foxp3- effector T cells in 
the Il6ΔDC mice might determine the resistance of Il6ΔDC mice to EAE. As measured by dye 
dilution, 2D2 T cells primed in Il6ΔDC mice proliferated as well as 2D2 T cells primed in 
Il6flox/flox control mice but showed higher production of IFN-γ (Fig. 8a, b). Neutralization 
of IFN-γ in Il6ΔDC mice with a monoclonal antibody to IFN-γ fully restored EAE severity 
in Il6ΔDC mice compared to Il6ΔDC mice treated with a control antibody (Fig. 8c). In 
summary, these data imply that priming of TH17 cells in Il6ΔDC mice in the absence of DC-
mediated IL-6 cluster signaling results in the exaggerated expression of IFN-γ in CD4+ T 
cells, most likely due to aberrant Stat3 activation in these cells.
Discussion
Here, we show that T cells respond to IL-6 in the absence of IL-6Rα expression through a 
process that we call IL-6 cluster signaling, in which DC-membrane bound IL-6Rα 
complexed with IL-6 is presented in trans and sensed by gp130 molecules expressed on T 
cells. IL-6 cluster signaling not only substitutes for classic IL-6 signaling, but leads to 
qualitatively different T cell responses. The prototypic cytokine to be trans-presented by 
auxiliary cells via its high affinity receptor is IL-15 28. It is likely that similar to IL-15, IL-6 
is loaded onto IL-6Rα in endosomal compartments. Trans-presentation has also been 
proposed for another IL-6 family member, cardiotrophin-like cytokine, through binding to 
the CNTF receptor 29. Although IL-6 forms a stable complex with soluble IL-6Rα, the 
affinity of IL-6 for IL-6Rα is only about 0.5 to 1 nM 13, and thus two orders of magnitude 
lower than the affinity of IL-15 for IL-15Rα. However, membrane bound cytokine trans-
presentation was also reported for IL-2, whose affinity for IL-2Rα is in the same range as 
the affinity of IL-6 for IL-6Rα 13,30.

 When interacting with T cells, DC mediated IL-6 cluster signaling can restrict the IL-6 
signal to cognate T cells, with high temporal synchronization with the TCR signal. Such 
coordination of signals leads to the imprinting of pathologic properties in recipient T cells. 
Notably, Foxp3 suppression is induced in T cells with reduced or even absent Stat3 
signaling, and can be fully supported by classic IL-6 signaling. Therefore, the IL-6 that 
prevents the upregulation of Foxp3 in T cells does not have to be derived from the priming 
DC, and can be derived in soluble form from the micro-milieu. Hence, it is possible that the 
suppression of Foxp3 induction in T cells occurs as a "bystander" effect of ambient IL-6. 
However, the IL-6-dependent induction of inflammatory properties in Foxp3- T cells is only 
efficient in the context of antigen-presentation, and likely does not occur as a bystander 
effect of ambient IL-6. This suggests that IL-6-mediated pathogenic T cell differentiation 
passes through two checkpoints: the suppression of Foxp3 induction via classic IL-6 
signaling and the initiation of a pathogenic effector T cell transcriptional program via IL-6 
cluster signaling. Therefore, the ability to induce pathogenic TH17 cells is dependent on 
antigen presenting cells that can co-present IL-6 in trans.
Here, we show that IL-6+IL-6Rα+ DCs that are able to perform cluster signaling are CD103- 
and belong to the subset of CD11b+Sirpα+ DCs that were recently classified as cDC2 31 and 
were previously associated with pathogenic TH17 responses 32. Because no mechanistic 
underpinning of the unique instructive capacity of this DC subset to instruct TH17 responses 
has been identified, IL-6 cluster signaling in the context of synchronized antigen 
presentation might be an intriguing hypothesis. In contrast to classic IL-6 signaling, IL-6 
cluster signaling leads to an earlier and more robust expression of IL-23R in antigen-
activated T cells. Therefore, facilitated sensing of IL-23 further supports their pathogenic 
phenotype 33. Vice versa, in the absence of IL-6 cluster signaling, IL-23 is unable to 
compensate for the impaired initiation of a pathogenic transcriptional program in antigen 
specific T cells, suggesting that the synchronization of antigen-specific priming and IL-6-
mediated Stat3 signaling is fundamental for the pro-inflammatory phenotype of T cells. 
Because T cell blasts extensively downregulate cell surface expression of IL-6Rα, it is 
plausible that IL-6 cluster signaling is a means to combine a “pathogenic” IL-6 signal with 
cognate re-activation. The APC type and the anatomical compartment of this process have 
not been exactly defined.
We provide evidence that lack of IL-6 cluster signaling during TH17 priming deviates the 
cytokine phenotype into IFN-γ production, which is in part dependent on Eomes expression. 
Although there has been some controversy 34, IL-6 has been shown to suppress the 
development of Th1 cells via direct and indirect mechanisms 35. Here we demonstrate that 
IL-6 cluster signaling in particular is an efficient means to prevent the induction of IFN-γ 
during TH cell differentiation. In our model, in the absence of IL-6 cluster signaling, 
insufficient Stat 3 activation, and thus a Stat1-Stat3 imbalance, allows for the expression of 
Eomes and IFN-γ in TH17 priming conditions and results in impaired encephalitogenicity.
Finally, the possibility of IL-6 cluster signaling has implications for therapeutic 
interventions. Anti-IL-6 antibodies fail to inhibit IL-6 cluster signaling. The IL-6-IL-6Rα 
complex formation occurs within DCs, most likely followed by targeted shuttling to plasma 
membrane regions involved in the cognate interaction with T cells, with immediate

 accessibility to gp130 molecules on the T cell side. Therefore, site I of the IL-6 molecule 10, 
which mediates IL-6 binding to IL-6Rα and is targeted by most anti-IL-6 antibodies, is 
already buried in the IL-6-IL-6Rα complex when it appears at the plasma membrane. 
Although sgp130-Fc suppresses IL-6 trans-signaling 14, IL-6 cluster signaling is not 
inhibited by sgp130-Fc, and we hypothesize that sgp130-Fc cannot access the IL-6-IL-6Rα 
complex at the DC-T cell interaction zone. However, similar to classic IL-6 signaling and 
IL-6 trans-signaling, IL-6 cluster signaling remains amenable to neutralization via anti-
IL-6Rα antibodies. Thus, IL-6 targeting strategies have to be carefully re-evaluated for the 
differential signaling modalities when designing therapeutic strategies for autoimmunity, 
chronic inflammation, and cancer.

Generation of Il6RD mice
To generate a new conditional IL-6 reporter/depleter strain [Il6RD; 
Il6tm3307(Cerulean-P2A-CD90.1)Arte] allowing for detection and specific depletion of IL-6 
producing cells, we targeted Exon 2 of the Il6 locus on chromosome 5 by insertion of a 
loxP-flanked transcription termination cassette (STOP) followed by a reporter cassette. The 
reporter expression cassette comprised (i) fluorescent reporter Cerulean, PCR-amplified 
from the cloning vector pDH51-GW-CFP; (ii) 2A peptide from Porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A), 
the aa sequence GSGATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPGP 36 was synthetically attached to the 
adjacent sequences using oligonucleotides; (iii) Thy1.1 (CD90.1) surface protein, that is in 
C57BL/6 mice (endogenously expressing allele Thy1.2 [CD90.2]) exclusively expressed on 
Il6 reporter positive cells. The sequence was provided by M. Schmidt-Supprian and is 
identical to the GenBank # AAR17087.1; (iv) a polyadenylation signal BGH pA, derived 
from the plasmid pcDNA3.1(+). A targeting vector MW21214 containing the floxed STOP 
cassette and the reporter expression cassette was generated. To target this construct to the Il6 
locus, homologous arms were amplified from BAC clone C57BL/6J RPCIB-731. The SHA 
(short homologous arm) encompassed ~4kb upstream of Il6, Exon1, Intron 1 and 31 
nucleotides of Exon 2. The natural Exon 1 contains the 5´UTR and the translation initiation 
codon (START) which was mutated in the targeting vector (noSTART) by site directed 
mutagenesis (from ATG into AAG) in order to prevent transcription of the remaining mouse 
Il6 gene. Downstream of the expression cassette, a positive selection marker (CAGGS 
promoter driven puromycin resistance) was inserted, that was flanked by FRT sites allowing 
for Flp-mediated deletion of the selection marker. The downstream LHA (long homologous 
arm) consisting of 5.7 kb of the Il6 gene encompassed the remaining 153 nucleotides of 
exon 2, the complete intron 2, exon 3, intron 3, exon 4, and a partial intron 4. With the 
exception of the mutated start codon in exon 1, the genomic sequence was left intact, in 
order to preserve all potential regulatory elements of Il6. For negative selection, a PGK 
promoter driven HSV TK was inserted. The targeting vector MW21214 was approved by 
complete sequencing, linearized by NotI and transfected into the C57BL/6N ES cell line Art 
B6 3.6 by electroporation to generate heterozygous targeted ES cells. Homologous 
recombinant clones were isolated using positive (PuroR) and negative (TK) selections. 
Clones were screened by PCR, resulting in 22% targeting frequency. The majority of the 
clones analyzed carried the inserted point mutation of the start codon. Four clones were

 expanded and validated by Southern Blot and PCR analyses. Targeted ES cells were injected 
into blastocysts (isolated at dpc 3.5 from superovulated, mated BALB/c females). Injected 
blastocysts were transferred into pseudopregnant NMRI females (2.5 days post coitum). 
Chimerism was evaluated by coat color and highly chimeric mice were bred to Flp-Deleter 
mice (C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-Flpe)2Arte), allowing for (i) identification of germline transmission 
and (ii) Flp-mediated deletion of the positive selection marker. Il6RD mice were crossed with 
CMV-Cre [Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn] for ubiquitous expression or with CD11c-Cre [Tg(Itgax-
cre)1-1Reiz] mice for DC-specific, conditional expression of the reporter cassette after Cre-
mediated removal of the STOP cassette. Under control of the endogenous Il6 promoter, a 
chimeric transcript harboring the Cerulean ORF fused to the P2A sequence and the CD90.1 
ORF is expressed. The P2A provides effective co-translational cleavage in vitro and in vivo, 
resulting in strict stoichiometric co-expression of individual Cerulean and CD90.1 proteins 
with correct subcellular localization (cytoplasm or cell surface, respectively).
Mice
Il6flox/flox [Il6tm1.1Jho] 8,37, Foxp3.gpf KI [Foxp3tm1Kuch] 5,36,38, Il23r.gfp KI 
[Il23rtm1Kuch] 26 and MOG35-55 specific TCR transgenic 2D2 mice 
[Tg(Tcra2D2,Tcrb2D2)1Kuch] 39 were described previously. Il6-/- [Il6tm1Kopf] were obtained 
from Jackson Laboratory. Il6raflox/flox mice were kindly provided by Thomas Wunderlich 
40. OVA323-339 specific TCR transgenic OT II mice [Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn] with the congenic 
marker CD45.1 were kindly provided by D. Busch (Institute for Medical Microbiology, 
Immunology and Hygiene, TU Munich). Stat3flox/flox mice [Stat3tm2Aki] were received from 
F. Greten (Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer Haus, 
Frankfurt). sgp130-Fc transgenic mice were previously described 41. For the EAE 
experiments reported in supplementary Fig. 10, opt_sgp130-Fc mice were used. To generate 
mice with cell-type specific excision of floxed cassettes, floxed mice were bred with CD11c 
Cre [Tg(Itgax-cre)1-1Reiz], CD4 Cre [Tg(Cd4-cre)1Cwi], CD19 Cre [Cd19tm1(cre)Cgn] or 
LysM Cre [Lyz2tm1(cre)Ifo], respectively (all from Jackson Laboratory). To visualize Cre-
expressing cells, for some experiments a Cre reporter allele Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos 
was crossed in. All mouse strains were on pure C57BL/6 background. Animals were kept in 
a specific pathogen-free facility at the TU Munich or Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. 
All experimental protocols were approved by the standing committee for experimentation 
with laboratory animals of the Bavarian or Rhine Palatinate state authorities and carried out 
in accordance with the corresponding guidelines (AZ 55.2-1-54-2532-29-13, AZ 
55.2-1-54-2532-95-14 and 23 177-07/G 13-1-099).
Induction of EAE
To induce EAE, mice were immunized s.c. (base of tail) with 200 µl of an emulsion 
containing 200 µg MOG35-55 (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK; Auspep, Tullamarine, 
Australia) and 500 µg M. tuberculosis H37Ra (BD Difco) in CFA and received 200 ng PTx 
(Sigma) i.v. on the same day and 2 d after the immunization. Clinical signs of disease were 
monitored as described previously 42. To ablate Il6 reporter (Thy1.1) expressing cells, mice 
were treated with i.p. injections of anti-Thy1.1 antibodies (19E12) or isotype control 
antibodies (mouse IgG2a; C1.18.4). For in vivo neutralization of IFN-γ, mice received anti-
IFN-γ antibodies (R4-6A2) or isotype control antibodies (rat IgG1; HRPN). Antibodies

 were obtained from BioXCell and were injected at a dose of 200 µg starting one day after 
immunization followed by injections every other day until the development of first signs of 
disease. For adoptive transfer experiments, mice of the indicated genotypes received 2.5 x 
106 naïve GFP (Foxp3)- 2D2 cells i.v. one day prior to immunization.
Preparation of CNS mononuclear cells
At the peak of disease, CNS-infiltrating cells were isolated after perfusion through the left 
cardiac ventricle with PBS. Brain and spinal cord were dissected and digested with 
collagenase D (2.5 mg/ml) and DNase I (1 mg/ml) at 37°C for 45 min. After passing the 
tissue through a 70 µm cell strainer, cells were separated by discontinuous Percoll gradient 
(70%/37%) centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the interphase.
Preparation of naïve T cells and differentiation of T helper cell subsets
Naïve T helper cells were isolated from peripheral lymph nodes and spleens. Naïve T cells 
were isolated using magnetic beads (Naïve CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit, Miltenyi Biotec) or 
subsequent to enrichment of T helper cells (CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit, untouched, Miltenyi 
Biotec) by FACS (CD4+CD44lowGFP (Foxp3)-). For T helper cell differentiation, naïve T 
cells were stimulated for 3 days with plate-bound antibody to CD3 (145-2C11, 4 μg/ml) and 
soluble antibody to CD28 (PV-1, 2 μg/ml). Recombinant cytokines were added to the 
differentiation cultures as indicated: human TGF-β1 (0.25 to 2 ng/ml) and/or mouse IL-6 (50 
ng/ml), all R&D Systems. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium 
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol, nonessential amino acids 
(MEM-NEAA), MEM Vitamins, Folic Acid, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin and 
0.1 mg/ml Gentamicin. In some experiments, we compared the capacity of soluble IL-6 vs 
hyper-IL-6 19. Here, we differentiated naïve T cells of the indicated genotypes in the 
presence of TGF-β (0.1 to 0.5 ng/ml) and equimolar amounts of hyper-IL-6 and human 
IL-6.
Isolation of DCs
Peripheral lymph nodes and spleens were injected with digestion mix (1mg/ml Collagenase 
D and 20 μg/ml DNase I [Roche], 2% FCS in HEPES-buffered RPMI-1640). Organs were 
fragmented and incubated at 37°C for 45 min. To disrupt cell complexes, 10 mM EDTA was 
added for additional 5 min. Cell suspensions were passed through 100 µm cell strainers.
Generation and culture of BMDCs
Bone marrow derived DCs were generated by flushing out femora and tibiae. Viable cells 
were cultured in clone medium supplemented with GM-CSF and IL-4 (both 20 ng/ml, R&D 
Systems) for 6 days with splitting every other day. DCs were removed by vigorous pipetting 
and cultured in the presence of TLR ligands CpG [ODN 1826] from InVivoGen or LPS 
[E.coli 0111:B4 Lipopolysaccharide], Sigma-Aldrich.
BMDC / T cell co-culture
Naïve 2D2 T cells were pre-cultured overnight (at a ratio of 1:4) with splenocytes or 
BMDCs from Il6flox/flox mice, Il6-/- mice, or Il6ΔDC mice in the presence of 50 µg/ml

 MOG35-55. For some experiments naïve 2D2 and OT II T cells were pre-cultured with 
BMDCs of the indicated genotypes in the presence of either MOG35-55 or OVA323-339 
(ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR; Auspep, Tullamarine, Australia). LPS (0.5 µg/ml) was added 
and cells were harvested at the indicated time points for analysis. In some experiments, 
Marimastat (3 μM, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to block IL-6Rα shedding. To analyze 
different IL-6 signaling modes, blocking agents were added in equimolar concentrations: 
anti-IL6 (Polyclonal Goat IgG, R&D or monoclonal mAb#8, Ref. 43), anti-IL6R (MR16-1), 
and sgp130-Fc 14.
Flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining
Cells were stained with live/dead fixable dyes (Aqua [405 nm exc] or Near-IR [633 nm exc], 
Invitrogen) and antibodies to surface markers: CD3 (clone 145-2C11), CD4 (GK1.5 or 
RM4-5), CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (HL3), CD19 (6D5), CD25 (PC61), CD44 (IM7), CD45.1 
(A20), CD45.2 (104), CD69 (H1.2F3), Thy1.1 (CD90.1, Ox-7), CD96 (3.3), CD103 (2E7), 
CD126 (IL-6Rα, D7715A7), CD130 (gp130, KGP130), CD172 (SIRPα, P84), 2D2 TCR 
Vα3.2 (RR3-16) Vβ11 (RR3-15), Ly6G (1A8 ), MHC II (M5/114.15.2), NK1.1 (PK136), 
SiglecH (eBio440c); all BD Biosciences, eBioscience or BioLegend. For intracellular 
cytokine staining, cells were re-stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 μg/ml 
ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and monensin (1 μl/ml BD GolgiStop) at 37 °C for 2.5 h. 
Subsequent to live/dead and surface staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized (Cytofix/
Cytoperm and Perm/Wash Buffer; BD Biosciences), and stained for cytokines IL-17A 
(TC11-18H10.1; BioLegend), IFN-γ (XMG1.2, eBioscience), IL-10 (JES5-16E3, BD 
Biosciences), and GM-CSF (MP1-22E9, BD Biosciences). For intracellular staining of IL-6 
in BMDCs, cells were stimulated with TLR ligands for 3 h before adding 5 μg/ml Brefeldin 
A (Sigma-Aldrich) for further 2 h. Subsequent to live/dead and surface staining, fixation and 
permeabilization, cells were stained for IL-6 (MP5-20F3, BD). For intranuclear staining of 
Foxp3 (FJK-16s, eBioscience), cells were stained for live/dead discrimination and surface 
markers. Fixation, permeabilization, and intranuclear staining were performed according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions (Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set, eBioscience). To 
analyze Stat3 activation, cells were fixed with Phosflow Lyse/Fix Buffer (BD) for 10 min at 
37 °C, permeabilized with PhosFlow Perm Buffer III (BD) for 30 min on ice and stained 
simultaneously for surface markers and Tyrosine 705 phosphorylated Stat3 (4/P-STAT3, 
BD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were analyzed using a CyAn ADP 9 
flow cytometer (Beckmann/Coulter) and FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Detection of antigen specific T cells ex vivo
MOG specific cytokine producing T helper cells were analyzed around day 7 to 8 after 
immunization. Single cell suspensions from draining lymph nodes or spleens were 
restimulated with 30 μg/ml MOG35-55 for 6 h in the presence of 5 μg/ml Brefeldin A during 
the last 3 h of incubation followed by surface and intracellular cytokine staining as described 
above. MOG specific T cells were detected via staining of fixed and permeabilized cells 
with biotinylated anti-CD40L (CD154, clone MR1, eBioscience) and fluorochrome-coupled 
Streptavidin.

 ELISA
IL-6 amounts in cell culture supernatant and in the serum of immunized mice were 
quantified using standard sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems, DuoSet). Standard curves and 
sample concentrations were calculated based on the mean of triplicates for each dilution or 
sample.
Quantitative PCR analysis
For quantitative PCR, RNA was extracted using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). cDNA was 
transcribed using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents as recommended (Applied 
Biosystems) and used as template for quantitative PCR. Primer plus FAM-labelled probe 
mixtures were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Il1b: Mm00434228_m1; Il6: 
Mm99999064_m1; Il12a (p35): Mm00434165_m1; Il12b (p40): Mm01288989_m1; Il23a 
(p19): Mm00518984_m1; Eomes: Mm01351985_m1; Rorc: Mm00441144_g1; Tbx21: 
Mm00450960_m1). The gene expression was normalized to the expression of β-actin 
(ACTB, VIC-labelled probe).
RNA Seq
Total RNA was isolated from FACS sorted 2D2 GFP (Foxp3)- T cells re-isolated from 
draining lymph nodes after priming in Il6flox/flox host mice, Il6-/- host mice, or Il6ΔDC host 
mice. Three biological replicates were prepared for each condition. Total RNA was further 
purified with AmpureXP beads to remove impurities detected by UVvis spectrometry. This 
RNA was used to construct sequencing libraries using the Encore Complete RNA-Seq 
library system (NuGen Inc. Santa Clara, USA) according to the instructions of the 
manufacturer. In brief 125 ng of total RNA were treated with heat-labile ds DNAse (Thermo 
Scientific Inc., MA, USA) to remove residual DNA and used for mixed random-/polyA-
primed first-strand cDNA synthesis. After second strand synthesis the double-stranded 
cDNA was fragmented by sonication (Covaris M220; power 50 W, duty factor 20, 200 
cycles p. burst, 115 s treatment time). The fragmented cDNA was end repaired and ligated 
with sample-specific barcoded adaptors. After strand selection, the library was amplified (4 
cycles, 94 °C 30 sec, 55 °C 30 sec, 72 °C 60 sec and 12 cycles 94 °C 30 sec, 63 °C 30 sec, 
72 °C 60 sec) and purified and size-selected with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, CA, 
USA). Resulting libraries were quantified on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, 
USA). The barcoded libraries were pooled at 10 nM concentration for multiplexed 
sequencing. All libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 1500 as 100 b single reads to a depth 
of 25-30 Mio raw reads per sample. After demultiplexing of sequence data, adaptor 
sequences and polyA tails were removed and each library was mapped to the murine 
reference genome mm10 with the spliced-read aligner STAR 44. Based on the mapping 
results, sequence reads for annotated genes were counted with HTSeq 45. Comparative 
analyses of gene expression were performed with the DEseq2 package 46 as pairwise 
comparison of two groups for each combination of interest. The false discovery rate for 
detection of differentially abundant transcripts was set to 5 %.
For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) a ranked list of the fold change of RNA Seq read 
values or nanostring signals between wild primed and Il6ΔDC primed effector T cells isolated 
from draining lymph nodes was calculated. The java GSEA Desktop Application v2.2.1, was

 used in conjunction with the Molecular Signatures Database v45.1 to run the analysis. Data 
analysis of differentially enriched genes in wild type-primed and Il6ΔDC primed Foxp3- 2D2 
T cells was performed through the use of QIAGEN’s Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®, 
QIAGEN Redwood City,www.qiagen.com/ingenuity). The Molecule Activity Predictor 
(MAP) tool was used to investigate the effect of IL-6 signaling pathways on identified IL-6 
target genes.
Immunofluorescence, proximity ligation assay (PLA), and confocal microscopy
Naïve 2D2 T cells were cultured at a ratio of approximately 4:1 with CellTracker Deep Red 
(Molecular Probes) labeled BMDCs in chamber slides in the presence of MOG35-55 to form 
immunological synapses. Subsequent to LPS stimulation for 80 min, cells were fixed with 
ice-cold methanol, blocked and permeabilized in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 
1% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100. Incubation with primary antibody specific for IL-6 
(polyclonal goat IgG, R&D) diluted in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 
was carried out overnight at room temperature. Secondary Antibody (chicken anti-goat 
IgG_AF 488 conjugate; Invitrogen) was diluted in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 
0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for one hour at room temperature. Samples were mounted 
with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Molecular Probes) for nuclear 
counterstaining.
To visualize IL-6-IL-6Rα complexes, a proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Duolink In Situ Red Kit Goat/Rabbit, Sigma-
Aldrich) using primary antibodies specific for IL-6 (polyclonal goat IgG, R&D) and IL-6Rα 
(polyclonal rabbit IgG M-20, Santa Cruz).
Confocal image stacks were recorded on a confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000) 
equipped with x60/1.42 N.A. oil-immersion objective. All images were acquired 
sequentially. Maximum intensity projections and xz representations were generated using 
the open-source image analysis software Fiji 47. Gamma was adjusted nonlinearly to 
enhance visibility of morphological details.
Statistical analysis
Statistical evaluations of cell frequency measurements, cell numbers, mRNA amounts, and 
protein levels were performed with the unpaired Student’s t test when two populations were 
compared. Two-tailed p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Multiple comparisons 
were performed with one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc multiple comparisons tests as 
indicated in the legends to the figures. EAE scores between groups were analyzed as disease 
burden per individual day with one-way-ANOVA and post-hoc test as indicated.

post test. Representative of four experiments. (d) Naive T cells (CD4+CD44-GFP (Foxp3)-; 
left column) from 2D2 x Foxp3gfp.KI mice were transferred into WT congenic (CD45.1) 
mice followed by MOG35-55 immunization. At the indicated time points, 2D2 T cells were 
re-isolated from dLN and surface IL-6Rα expression was measured in activated (CD69+or 
CD25+) effector (GFP (Foxp3)-) 2D2 T cells vs non-activated 2D2 T cells (black). (e) 
Frequencies of Foxp3+ Tregs in dLN CD4+ T cells of control mice (Il6raflox/flox) vs 
Il6raΔDC, and Il6raΔT animals. Mean + SD, n≥4, *P<0.003 (ANOVA plus Tukey's multiple 
comparisons test). (f) Course of EAE in Il6raflox/flox control mice vs isotype treated and 
Treg-depleted Il6raΔT mice. To deplete Tregs, 0.5 mg of anti-CD25 (PC61) were injected i.p. 
on days -5 and -3 prior to immunization. Mean EAE scores + SEM, n≥9. *P<0.05, ANOVA

 Figure 7. T cell priming is aberrant in an Il6ΔDC environment and results in non-pathogenic T 
cells.
CD4+Foxp3- effector T cells were purified from dLN of MOG35-55 immunized control 
(Il6flox/flox), Il6-/-, or Il6ΔDC mice and analyzed by nanostring. (a) GSEA for a non-
pathogenic TH17 gene set 8 was performed. Il6st (encoding gp130), Eomes, and Cd96 were 
highly enriched in effector T cells primed in Il6ΔDC mice. (b, c) Control mice or Il6ΔDC 
mice were immunized with MOG35-55 and after 7 days, the expression of CD96 (b) and 
intracellular cytokines (c) were assessed on CD40L+ T cells upon restimulation with
