Background-—Asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome with different clinical subtypes that is associated with an increased risk for
cardiovascular disease (CVD). We hypothesized that the late-onset subtype of asthma is associated with a higher risk of incident
CVD.
Methods and Results-—Participants from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort free of CVD at baseline were followed for a mean (SD) of 13.9
(5.9) years for development of CVD (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, coronary revascularization, heart failure, or CVD death).
Late-onset asthma was defined as physician-diagnosed asthma at age ≥18 years. Multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for
age, sex, and CVD risk factors were used to assess associations of late-onset asthma and incident CVD. The 1269 participants were
47.3 (8.0) years old; 166 participants had asthma (111 late-onset, 55 early-onset). Participants with late-onset asthma compared to
nonasthmatics were more likely to be female (67% versus 44%) and to have a higher body-mass index (32.2 versus 29.4 kg/m2)
(P<0.05). Mean age of asthma diagnosis in the late-onset group was 39.5 (9.6) years versus 8.9 (5.7) years in the early-onset group
(P<0.0001). Late-onset asthmatics had a higher adjusted risk of incident CVD than nonasthmatics (hazard ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.01–
2.45, P=0.045). There was no interaction between body-mass index and age of asthma diagnosis on incident CVD (P=0.83).
Conclusions-—In a large cohort study of adults followed prospectively for over a decade, late-onset asthmatics had an increased
risk of incident CVD events that persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and CVD risk factors. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:

A
sthma is an inflammatory disorder that poses a signif-
icant public health burden.1 In the United States over
25 million individuals have asthma and the prevalence of
asthma continues to rise.1 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) also
poses a significant public health burden and remains the
leading cause of death among adults in the United States.2
Asthma and CVD share an underlying inflammatory patho-
physiology.3–5 An increased risk of CVD events has been
found in individuals with other chronic inflammatory diseases,
including those with higher levels of subclinical systemic
inflammation.3,6–14
We and others have demonstrated an increased risk of CVD
events in asthmatics.15–22 However,asthma is a heterogeneous
clinical syndrome that can be divided into distinct phenotypes,
each possessing a unique pathophysiology.23 One classifica-
tion of asthma phenotypes is by the age of disease onset. Late-
onset asthma commences at older ages and often is more
severe and refractory to standard pharmacotherapeutic regi-
mens than early-onset asthma.23 In many of these prior
investigations, however, CVD risk within a specific asthma
subtype was not investigated.15–18,22,24 We hypothesized that
the late-onset phenotype of asthma is associated with a higher
CVD risk in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC).

 The design of the WSC has been described previously.25 Study
protocols and informed consent documents were approved by
the University of Wisconsin Health Sciences Institutional
Review Board. Participants were selected from a random
sample from payroll records of State of Wisconsin employees
aged 30 to 60 years. Of the 2940 individuals invited to
undergo a baseline overnight in-laboratory protocol, 1546
(53%) participated. Compared to the entire sampling frame,
cohort participants had a slightly healthier profile and lower
death rate.25–27
The participants in the current analysis (n=1267) were
those who, at the time of the baseline polysomnography
study, had not experienced a CVD event, had complete
baseline covariate data, and had at least 1 polysomnogra-
phy study to assess CVD outcomes and asthma diagnosis
(Figure 1). Baseline visits were completed between July
1989 and April 2003; follow-up was observed through
December 2013. Incident CVD information was obtained
from self-reported detailed health history questionnaires
regarding specific types of physician-diagnosed CVD with

CVD
outcomes; and/or death records searches. Health surveys
were mailed to all participants in 2008 and during 2010–
2013. Deaths were assessed in 2013, as described in the
following paragraphs.
Asthma Definitions
To account for the heterogeneity of asthma phenotypes, we
stratified asthma into 2 subgroups: those with early-onset
asthma and those with late-onset asthma at the baseline visit.
The definition of asthma in the WSC has been described
previously.28 Similar to previous reports, asthma in the
current study was defined as a self-reported history of
physician-diagnosed
asthma.28
Late-onset
asthma
was
defined as asthma diagnosed at age 18 years or older,
whereas early-onset asthma was defined as asthma diag-
nosed prior to 18 years of age. Further adjudication of the
asthma diagnosis was performed by a WSC physician on any
participant
indicating
a
history
of
physician-diagnosed
asthma. Participants had to indicate they had physician-
diagnosed asthma on at least 2 interviews and have provided
the year of the asthma diagnosis to be classified as asthmatic
in the current study. If a participant indicated a diagnosis of
asthma on 1 interview, but was never treated and did not
indicate asthma on subsequent interviews, they were not
considered to have asthma.28
CVD Event Assessment
The outcome measure was occurrence of a CVD event during
follow-up (through December 2013). CVD events were
defined as the occurrence of coronary death, myocardial
infarction, angina, stroke, coronary revascularization, heart
failure, or CVD death. CVD events were identified through 2
methods: health history questionnaires performed at the time
of follow-up visits and mailed health surveys. Any inconsis-
tencies
in
CVD
events
between
serial
sampling
were
adjudicated by a WSC study physician. Identification of
CVD deaths in the cohort occurring up to May 2013 was
performed as reported previously.29 Deaths were identified
by matching Social Security numbers with 2 death record
sources: the National Death Index and the Wisconsin State
Bureau of Health Information and Policy, Vital Records
Section. Matches on Social Security numbers were verified
with participants’ age and sex. All deaths in Wisconsin,
reported by the vital records of Wisconsin, also were
identified in the National Death Index; in addition, deaths
occurring outside of Wisconsin were identified by the
National Death Index. Date of death was available for all
decedents. Underlying and contributory causes of deaths
were available from Wisconsin Vital Statistics. Wisconsin
Vital Statistics and the National Death Index supplied files
with data on each individual death, including the cause of
death and corresponding description as abstracted from
individual death certificates. For all deaths, cause of death
was further ascertained and adjudicated by examining each
death certificate for primary cause, secondary cause, and
underlying conditions by a WSC study physician.

 CVD Risk Factors
Biologic confounders were assessed at the baseline visit in
the WSC through standardized interviews and objective
clinical assessments. Hypertension status was defined as
baseline systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg or diastolic
pressure >90 mm Hg or the use of antihypertensive medica-
tions. Smoking status was defined as never, past, or current
smoking. Diabetes mellitus was defined as self-reported
diabetes or use of diabetic medications. Body-mass index was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared.
Polysomnography
Polysomnograms (Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA) were
performed at the University of Wisconsin Hospital. Sleep
state was determined by electroencephalography, electroocu-
lography,
and
electromyography.
Arterial
oxyhemoglobin
saturation, oral and nasal airflow, nasal air pressure, and
thoracic cage and abdominal respiratory motion were used to
detect obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) events. Sleep state and
respiratory event scoring were performed by trained sleep
technicians. The polysomnograms used in this analysis were
obtained between 1989 and 2004; each 30-s epoch of the
each polysomnographic record was scored for breathing
events and for sleep stage using criteria described by
Rechtschaffen and Kales.30 Cessation of airflow lasting
≥10 s defined an apnea event. A discernible reduction in
the sum of thoracic plus abdomen respiratory inductance
plethysmography amplitude that lasted at least 10 s and that
was associated with a ≥4% reduction in oxyhemoglobin
saturation defined a hypopnea event. The average number of
apnea plus hypopnea events/hour of sleep defined the
apnea–hypopnea index.
Statistical Methods
Baseline descriptive statistics are reported as means (SD) for
continuous variables and percentages for categorical vari-
ables. Incident CVD was analyzed as time-to-event by asthma
categories (early-onset, late-onset, no asthma) and by age of
asthma diagnosis. Censoring time was defined as the years
from the baseline visit date to the date of the first occurrence
of the CVD event or CVD death, if more than 1 event was
reported. For participants who did not experience a CVD
event, lost-to-follow-up time was defined as the years
between the baseline visit and the participant’s last in-
laboratory polysomnography study. Unadjusted CVD-free
survival rates comparing participants with late-onset asthma,
early-onset asthma, and those without asthma were calcu-
lated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Unadjusted incident
CVD rates were calculated for those with late-onset asthma,
early-onset asthma, and those without asthma. Cox propor-
tional hazard models were utilized to compare the survival
distribution of the 3 groups while adjusting for potential
confounders. The proportional
hazards assumption was
evaluated using Schoenfield’s test. A series of models were
created by adding potential known confounders into each
model. Model 0 was unadjusted. Model 1 adjusted for age and
sex. Model 2 adjusted additionally for smoking history, lipid
medication use, and diabetes mellitus. Model 3 included the
confounders in model 2 and hypertensive status. Model 4, the
primary prespecified analysis, included the covariates in
model 3 and body-mass index. Effect modification by sex and
by body-mass index (eg, interaction models with age of
asthma diagnosis) was tested using Cox proportional hazard
models on the final model with all potential confounders
included. Secondary analysis of baseline OSA25 interacting
with age of asthma diagnosis was also tested using Cox
proportional hazard models on the final model with all
potential confounders included. Statistical significance was
set at a 2-sided P<0.05 for the main analyses and at 2-sided
P<0.01 for interactions. Analyses were performed in SAS
(Version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
Descriptive Characteristics
The 1269 participants were followed for 13.9 (5.9) years. At
baseline, participants were 47.3 (8.0) years old; 46% were
female and 166 participants had asthma. The 111 participants
with late-onset asthma and the 55 participants with early-
onset asthma were compared to the 1103 participants
without asthma. The distribution of CVD risk factors between
those with late-onset and early-onset asthma differed slightly
compared to those without asthma (Table 1). Those with late-
onset asthma were more likely to be female (67% versus 44%),
had higher body-mass index (BMI, 32.2 versus 29.4 kg/m2),
and were more likely to be taking antihypertensive medica-
tions (22% versus 13%).
Asthma and CVD Events
A total of 223 CVD events (179 in the nonasthma group, 22 in
the late-onset asthma group, and 7 in the early-onset asthma
group) occurred during the observation period. The incidence
rate for CVD events was highest in late-onset asthmatics. The
10-year CVD-event rates were 12.7% (95% CI 5.9–19.6) for
those with late-onset asthma, 3.8% (0.1–9.0%) for those with
early-onset asthma, and 8.9% (7.1–10.7%) for nonasthmatics
(P=0.16). In multivariate models adjusted for potential
confounders, having late-onset asthma was associated with
a significantly higher risk of CVD events (Table 2). In models

 adjusted for age and sex (Table 2, Model 1), participants with
late-asthma had a higher risk of CVD events (hazard ratio [HR]
1.62 [1.04–2.51], P=0.029). This association persisted in
models fully adjusted for potential confounders as partici-
pants with late-onset asthma had a higher risk of CVD events
compared to nonasthmatics (HR 1.57 [1.01–2.45], P=0.045)
(Table 2, Model 4; Figure 2). Participants with early-onset
asthma had no difference in CVD events compared to
nonasthmatics in models adjusted for age and sex (HR 0.81
[0.40–1.65], P=0.56) and fully adjusted models (HR 0.94
[0.46–1.92], P=0.873) (Table 2, Model 4, Figure 2).
Interaction effects of sex9age of asthma diagnosis
and BMI9age of asthma diagnosis were not significant
(Pinteraction=0.93 and 0.83, respectively). In separate instances
of Model 4, the HR for late-onset asthma and future CVD
events was 1.46 (95% CI 0.78–2.75, P=0.24) in men (N=689)
and 1.65 (0.85–3.19, P=0.14) in women (N=578), values that
are similar to each other and the overall effect we observed.
Considering years postmenopause as an independent variable
(in women only) did not appreciably change the effect of late-
onset asthma in Model 4 (HR 1.79 [0.93–3.48], P=0.08). For
participants with BMI <30 kg/m2 (N=759), the HR for late-
onset asthma was 1.90 (95% CI 0.98–3.71, P=0.06) without
BMI in the model and it was 1.92 (95% CI 0.99–3.75,
P=0.055) with BMI in the model. For BMI >30 kg/m2
(N=508), the HR for late-onset asthma was 1.37 (95% CI
0.75–2.48, P=0.31) without BMI in the model and it was 1.34
(95% CI 0.74–2.45, P=0.34) with BMI in the model. In the
latter model, the effect of BMI on future CVD events was
statistically significant and in the expected direction (HR 1.06,
95% CI 1.03–1.08, P<0.0001).
Because OSA plausibly could confound or mediate an
association between asthma and CVD, we added a measure
of OSA severity (the logarithm10 of the apnea–hypopnea
index +1, due to the high prevalence of zero values) to the
final models for early- and late-onset asthma predicting CVD.
In both cases, there was minimal (<4%) change in the
magnitude of the asthma coefficient when OSA severity was
added to the model. Furthermore, in an exploratory analysis

 of 731 participants with recorded nocturnal oxygen desat-
uration, percent of time with oxygen saturation <90% and
minimum nocturnal oxygen saturation were not significant
predictors of CVD events and had similar beta coefficients
for asthma as did the logarithm10 of the apnea–hypopnea
index +1. Oxygen desaturation parameters also did not
interact with asthma to predict CVD events. Thus, we found
little evidence of either substantial confounding or mediation
by OSA. In exploratory analyses, we added the 13 positive
airway pressure therapy users excluded from the models
above to them; however, their inclusion did not substantially
alter the reported HRs for asthma predicting later CVD
events (data not shown).
In an exploratory analysis, we also looked for an associ-
ation between a participant report of physician-diagnosed
gastroesophageal reflux disease and CVD events among 997
individuals in our cohort but did not identify one, nor did we
identify significant interactions between gastroesophageal
reflux disease and asthma or sex. Neither hours/week of
physical activity nor year of study entry was associated with
future CVD events or substantively altered the HR for the
relationship between late-onset asthma and CVD events.
Discussion
After over a decade of prospective observation, participants
with late-onset asthma but not early-onset asthma had a 1.6-
fold higher rate of CVD events than nonasthmatics in models
adjusted for potential confounders. Prior studies investigating
the associations of asthma and CVD yielded varying associ-
ations, with some finding no significant association with CVD,
others finding limited associations with specific end points,
and others finding consistent associations with CVD.15–22
Many reports have described an association of asthma and
CVD; however, few have investigated a possible association
between asthma subtype and CVD.19,20 The heterogeneity of
associations between asthma and CVD observed in the prior
reports may be due, in part, to the treatment of asthma as a
homogeneous condition, when in fact asthma is a heteroge-
neous condition with unique pathophysiology that describes
specific subtypes.23
Two previous reports have investigated the association of
age of asthma onset and CVD risk. Onufrak et al investigated
adult-onset asthma and coronary heart disease and stroke in
the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and
found that only women with adult-onset asthma had a higher
risk of coronary heart disease or stroke.19 Lee et al
performed a cross-sectional analysis in the 1999–2006
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
investigating the association of adult-onset asthma and CVD
and found increased risk of CVD with adult-onset asthma and
effect modification by sex.20
Our investigation supports these findings, though it differs
in both design and the specificity of certain results. First, as
opposed to the cross-sectional nature of the NHANES
investigation, ours is a prospective longitudinal cohort study
with over a decade of follow-up allowing for observation of the
natural course of the disease. Second, in both prior investi-
gations there was significant effect modification by sex in the
association of late-onset asthma and CVD. We did not find
significant effect modification by sex; however, our study is
smaller and may not have adequate power to detect effect
modification. Despite the study size, we saw a similar
magnitude of association in fully adjusted models, further
strengthening the support for the association of late-onset
asthma and CVD. Third, we used the definition of late-onset
asthma as asthma diagnosed at age 18 years or older, but the
ARIC study defined late-onset asthma with an age of diagnosis
of 21 years or older. The NHANES investigation used the
same age threshold that we used. The age definition of late-
onset asthma varies significantly in the literature, with some
reports defining late-onset asthma with an onset as young as
the age of 12 years while others defining onset at age
21 years or even older ages. We performed sensitivity
analyses that varied the age threshold for a diagnosis of
onset of adult-onset asthma to age 12 years or greater or age
21 years or greater and found a similar magnitude of
association.
Early-onset and late-onset asthma are 2 substantially
different disease processes and differ in their risk factors,
pathophysiology, and responses to treatment, though they
often are lumped together. The common risk factors for early-
onset asthma include family history of atopic disease, viral
and bacterial infections, and tobacco exposure.31 Early-onset
asthma is generally responsive to treatment with inhaled
corticosteroids.32 Late-onset asthma has myriad different risk
factors including environmental irritants, obesity, female sex
hormones, respiratory infections, stressful life events, and
aspirin use.33 Late-onset asthma often is more severe and, as
opposed to early-onset asthma, refractory to standard
treatments.23 Previous investigations have hypothesized the
increased risk of CVD may stem from an effect of estrogen-
modulated inflammation in adult-onset asthmatic women.19
This remains a plausible explanation for this specific pheno-
type of late-onset asthma; however, there is significant
phenotypic variation within late-onset asthma. Different
phenotypes of late-onset asthma that have been identified
include the following: late-onset obese female phenotype,
late-onset nonatopic inflammation predominant phenotype,
late-onset
mild
asthma,
and
smoking-related
late-onset
asthma.33 The effect of estrogens on asthma and CVD risk
provides a hypothesis for the increased CVD risk in the late-
onset obese female phenotype; however, the other subtypes
of late-onset asthma such as the late-onset inflammation

 predominant phenotype with fixed airway obstruction may
have unique features that increase CVD risk. Eosinophils,
which are increased in the late-onset nonatopic inflammation
phenotype, also may play a role in the increased CVD risk.
Elevated levels of eosinophils have been associated with
an increased risk of atherosclerosis and in 1 study, levels of
eotaxin, an eosinophilic specific chemoattractant directly
correlated
with
the
extent
of
angiographic
epicardial
atherosclerotic disease.34–36 In addition, as opposed to
early-onset asthma, risk factors for late-onset asthma include
many exogenous environmental triggers; the triggers that
serve as risk factors for lung disease also serve as risk factors
for CVD.33 There are many prior investigations that well
document the associations of levels of particulate matter with
lung and CVD disease.37–39 Finally, a feature more commonly
observed in the late-onset asthma phenotype is more severe
and refractory lung disease with a more precipitous decline in
lung function.40 Previous investigations have well character-
ized lung function as an independent predictor of CVD
events.41–43
Limitations
Despite the numerous strengths of this study, there are some
limitations. Asthma was a self-reported physician diagnosis
and therefore may be prone to misclassification bias.
However, previous studies have demonstrated a high sensi-
tivity (91%) and specificity (97%) for self-reported prevalent
asthma in epidemiologic studies.44 The very strict definition of
asthma used in the current study, which included participants
indicating asthma on 2 separate interviews with the date of
diagnosis, considering use of medications, and physician
adjudication, further strengthens the specificity of our asthma
diagnosis. Furthermore, a misclassification bias would bias
the results of our analyses toward the null. Age at asthma
diagnosis also was self-reported and may also be prone to
misclassification bias; however, self-reported age of asthma
onset has been used in many prior epidemiological investi-
gations and has been found to be an accurate assessment of
age of onset of the disease.45 We do not have objective
measures of asthma severity.
The number of CVD events, especially in individuals with
early-onset asthma, was small, so some associations may
have been missed. As an observational study, the described
associations do not confirm causation. Regression models
were adjusted for measured known confounders; however,
unmeasured confounders, including exposure to air pollution,
stressful life events, or regular aspirin use may affect both
asthma and CVD risk and could thus result in residual
confounding biasing away (pollution, stress) or toward
(aspirin) the null. Finally, the WSC is a predominantly white,
Wisconsin-based cohort so the generalizability of these
findings to populations with different characteristics may be
limited.
Conclusions
Late-onset, but not early-onset asthma was associated with
an increased risk of CVD events in this prospective observa-
tional study with over a decade of follow-up. Given the public
health burden of asthma, further investigations into the
mechanisms of this association in specific asthma pheno-
types are needed.
