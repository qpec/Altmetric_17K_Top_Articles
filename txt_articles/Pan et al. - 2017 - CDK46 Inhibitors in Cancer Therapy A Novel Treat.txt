Abstract. Patients with metastatic bladder cancer (mBC) treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy have a limited median
survival of only around 14 months [1]. Despite over 30 years of basic and clinical research, until recently no therapeutic
options beyond cisplatin-based therapy had entered clinical routine and, at least in the US, none of the tested agents had been
approved for second-line treatment. This has changed with the advent of immune checkpoint blockade, including especially
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The high response rates of 24% over a 14.4 month follow up led to the first US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval for a second line therapy for these patients, and it is likely that this marks the beginning of a
new era in the systemic treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer [2–4].
The strong clinical need to improve the medical management of this disease for those patients, not responding to current
therapy has led to an increased molecular understanding of bladder cancer and has forstered the development of many poten-
tial molecular manipulations and targeted strategies beyond the new immune-oncologic approaches. Among the molecular
alterations indentified in bladder cancer, cell cycle deregulation appears to be a key driver of disease progression. Target-
directed therapy against CDK4/6 is an emerging strategy to regain control of cell cycle deregulation. Here, we provide an
overview of the current status of CDK4/6 inhibitors in cancer therapy, their potential use in mBC and the challenges for their
clinical use.

REGULATION OF THE CELL CYCLE
PROGRESSION BY CDK4/6
The cell cycle progresses sequentially through the
gap 1 (G1), synthesis (S), gap 2 (G2) and mitosis
(M) stages. This progression is regulated via a com-
plex signaling network. The CDK proteins, CDK1,

CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, are major regulators of
cell cycle progression when complexed with spe-
cific cyclin proteins [5, 6]. Constitutive expression of
CDKsandtemporalcontrolofvariouscyclinsenables
the regulation of specific cell cycle phases by distinct
cyclin-CDK complexes [7]. CDK activity is nega-
tively regulated by several inhibitory proteins. The
various aspects of CDK biology and function have
been previously reviewed comprehensively [5, 6].
CDK4 and CDK6, which show structural and func-
tional homology, regulate the transition of quiescent
cells in the G1 phase into the S phase when com-
plexed with cyclin D proteins (Fig. 1). Cyclin D
proteins have three subtypes, cyclin D1-3, and accu-
mulate in the presence of mitogenic stimuli [6–8].
Negative regulators of CDK4/6 include the inhibitor
of CDK4 (INK4) proteins, p16INK4A, p15INK4B,
p18INK4C and p19INK4D, which inhibit CDK4/6
activity either by reducing their binding with
cyclin D1 or by directly occupying their catalytic
domains [9].
The kinase activity of CDK4/6 leads to the phos-
phorylation of members of the retinoblastoma (Rb)
protein family including Rb, p107 and p130, which
results in their functional inactivation [5, 8, 10]. In
quiescent cells, active hypophosphorylated Rb binds
to members of the E2F transcription factor fam-
ily together with other co-repressors, and suppresses
E2F function. Upon phosphorylation, Rb dissociates
from this complex and allows the transcription of E2F
target genes including cyclin A, cyclin E and DHFR,
among others, which are required for the transition of
the cell cycle into the S phase [10]. Hence, inhibition
of CDK4/6 activity leads to Rb dephosphorylation
and repression of E2F activity, which promotes a
G0/G1 arrest. This has fueled the development of
CDK4/6 inhibitors as target therapy in cancer cells.
Beside the CDK4/6-RB pathway, the p53 mediated
cell cycle checkpoint is also responsible for arresting
cells in G1/S. Cell cycle checkpoints are surveillance
mechanisms that detect DNA damage in cells, arrest
their cell cycle to allow time for repair and thus ensure
genome integrity in the next generation of daughter
cells [11]. The kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated
(ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related
(ATR) function as DNA damage sensors and directly
or indirectly phosphorylate p53. This phosphoryla-
tion interrupts the interaction between MDM2, a
ubiquitin ligase, and p53, thereby preventing protea-
somal degradation of p53 [11, 12]. Accumulation of
p53 increases the transcription of p21kip1, a CDK2
inhibitor, and thereby blocks cell cycle progression
into S phase [9, 13]. p53 stabilization also occurs via
p14ARF that can induce MDM2 degradation [14].
p14ARF is encoded by the CDKN2A gene that also
encodes for p16INK4A. Hence, the CDKN2A gene
locus can negatively regulate the cell cycle via both
p53- and Rb-dependent mechanisms.
THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF CDK4/6
INHIBITION IN BLADDER CANCER
Cell cycle deregulation is a common feature
of mBC and includes molecular alterations in the
CDK4/6-Rb pathway. CDKN2A and CDKN2B are
candidate tumor suppressors to be affected by chro-
mosome 9 deletions, which occur in over 50% of
mBC tumors [15, 16]. Inactivating mutations of RB1
are found in 11–20% of tumor specimens, which indi-
cates that up to 80% of bladder cancer patients that
still maintain functional RB1 might be eligible for
this therapy since the presence of RB1 is necessary
for the response to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Alterations in
CDKN2A and RB1 are also mutually exclusive [17].
These molecular alterations or changes in expres-
sion also correlate with the molecular subtypes of
mBC that have been described recently by multiple
groups. FGFR3 mutations together with CDKN2A
loss were observed in the UroB Lund subtype and
the TCGA cluster 2 subtype [17, 18]. Meanwhile,
the Lund GU subtype, basal tumors from the UNC
classification and TCGA cluster 3 were charac-
terized by RB1 mutations/deletions, and CCND1,
E2F3 or cyclin E1 (CCNE1) amplifications. These
basal tumors had a poorer prognosis as compared to
luminal tumors [17–19]. The Lund group also iden-
tified two distinct transcriptional circuits operating
in the various molecular subtypes. These were the
FGFR3/CCDN1 transcriptional circuit in UroA and
UroB tumors, partly characterized by high FGFR3
and CCDN1 expression together with CDKN2A
deletions, and the E2F3/RB1 circuit with deletions
of RB1, high CDKN2A and reduced FGFR3 in
GU tumors. Patients with tumors enriched for the
FGFR3/CCDN1 transcriptional circuit had a better
prognosis as compared to those with the E2F3/RB1
circuit [20]. Based upon the current knowledge on
response to CDK4/6 inhibitors, it is thus likely that
the subtype featuring FGFR3 mutations together with
CDKN2A loss is probably a responsive subtype.
Alterations in either p53, Rb, p16INK4A, cyclin
D1 or p21 expression have been identified as mark-
ers of disease progression, decreased disease-specific

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the CDK4/6-Rb pathway: CDK4/6 phosphorylate Rb upon complexing with cyclin D proteins. This
leads to the dissociation of Rb from the E2F family of transcription factors and allows transcription of E2F target genes that enable cell
cycle progression from the G1 to the S phase. Small molecule inhibitors of CDK4/6 inhibit Rb phosphorylation, S phase progression and
cell proliferation. CDK4/6 activity is also influenced by upstream mitogenic signaling pathways, inhibitor of CDK4 (INK4) proteins, as well
as checkpoint mechanims including the p53 pathway.

survival or poorer 5-year overall survival in vari-
ous studies. A worse prognosis was also observed
when patients had a combination of these molecular
alterations [21–23]. While inactivation of RB1 alone
does not result in tumor formation in vivo, loss of
all Rb family members results in the development
of bladder tumors. Moreover, invasive disease has
been observed in mice deficient in both p53 and
Rb upon exposure to carcinogens [24, 25]. These
studies demonstrate that the CDK4/6-Rb pathway is
frequently altered in mBC and can influence both
pathogenesis and prognosis. It is thus likely that tar-
geting the G1-S cell cycle transition has therapeutic
potential in mBC.
TARGETING THE CDK4/6-RB PATHWAY
IN CANCER
The disruption of the CDK4/6-Rb signaling path-
way and an uncontrolled G1-S transition of the
cell cycle is a common feature of cancer cells.
This can occur due to various molecular alterations
including loss of function mutations or deletions
of the RB1 gene (encoding for Rb), CDKN2A
(encoding for p16INK4A and p14ARF) or CDKN2B
(encoding for p15INK4B). Such deregulation can
also result from amplification or activating muta-
tions in CCND1 (encoding for cyclin D1), E2F1-3,
CDK4, CDK6 or components of various mitogenic
signaling pathways such as the PI3K or MAPK
pathways [26].
Several ATP-competitive small molecule CDK
inhibitors have been developed. However, first gener-
ation inhibitors such as flavopiridol are non-selective
and can inhibit multiple CDKs which might result
in limited efficacy and high toxicity [8]. Next
generation CDK4/6 inhibitors display high selec-
tivity and include palbociclib (PD-0332991 from
Pfizer), abemaciclib (LY-2835219 from Eli Lilly)
and ribociclib (LEE011 from Novartis) [27–29]
(Table 1). These CDK4/6 inhibitors have been
tested pre-clinically in in vitro and in vivo mod-
els of several cancer entities including leukemia,
breast cancer, melanoma, glioma, pancreatic can-
cer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma,
sarcoma, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, prostate can-
cer and mBC [8, 30]. In most studies they have
demonstrated a consistent molecular and functional
phenotype with a dose-dependent reduction in Rb
phosphorylation, protein expression and transcrip-
tion of E2F target genes, which correlates with a

G0/G1 arrest and inhibition of cell proliferation.
Additionally, all these reports demonstrate that Rb
expression is a pre-requisite for sensitivity to these
inhibitors.
Our group has recently investigated the effects of
CDK4/6 inhibitors in mBC. In our study, palboci-
clib (PD-0332991) was tested on a panel of 10 mBC
cell lines [30]. In Rb positive cell lines, we observed
a dose dependent reduction in total Rb protein that
correlated with a decrease in phosphorylated Rb.
This decrease in total Rb correlated partially with a
reduction in RB1 transcript levels and was associated
with a reduction in the transcription of E2F target
genes CCNA2 and CCNE2. A significant G0/G1 cell
cycle arrest and reduction in tumor proliferation and
growth was observed only in Rb positive cells, which
was also confirmed in a three-dimensional tumor
xenograft model using the chicken chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM).
CDK4/6 inhibitors are presently being tested in
over 80 clinical trials in oncology among them one
in bladder cancer (https://clinicaltrials.gov, clinical
trial identifier NCT02334527). Results from trials in
advanced hormone positive, HER2-negative breast
cancer have demonstrated a significant improvement
in progression free survival (PFS) using a combi-
nation of CDK4/6 inhibitors and hormone therapy
as compared to hormone therapy alone [31–34].
Based on these data, palbociclib and ribociclib have
been approved or designated as breakthrough ther-
apy, respectively, by the US FDA in this clinical
setting [32, 34] The efficiency and toxicity between
palbociclib and ribociclib are very similar. The prin-
cipal grade 3/4 adverse events are neutropenia and
leucopenia. Early results from trials in other solid
or hematological tumors have also demonstrated
acceptable safety and preliminary clinical benefit of
CDK4/6 inhibitors [35–37].
CHALLENGES TO THE CLINICAL USE
OF CDK4/6 INHIBITORS
Results from our group suggest that CDK4/6
inhibition has the potential to be an effective

therapeutic strategy in mBC. However, several
aspects of understanding the molecular mechanisms
of treatment response need further investigation.
Here, we discuss the challenges to enable an
effective transition from experimental models to clin-
ical implementation of CDK4/6 inhibitors in mBC
based on a critical review of published literature
to date.
Identification of the molecular mechanism of
CDK4/6 inhibitors
The mechanism by which CDK4/6 inhibitors are
proposed to act is the inhibition of kinase activ-
ity of CDK4/6. Preclinical studies have consistently
demonstrated that CDK4/6 inhibitors reduce the level
of phosphorylated Rb. However, with very few excep-
tions, this is accompanied by a synchronous decrease
in total Rb protein level as demonstrated in leukemia,
breast cancer, myeloma, glioma, pancreatic cancer,
ovarian cancer and mBC models [30, 38–48]. Despite
being a central aspect for the biochemical response
to CDK4/6 inhibition, this observation and the possi-
ble underlying mechanisms have not been adressed.
Since CDK4/6 inhibitors display anti-tumor activ-
ity only in Rb positive cells, the understanding
of the contribution of Rb protein level and/or its
phosphorylated form to this effect can improve our
understanding of the molecular determinants of ther-
apy response.
We have demonstrated that the transcript level of
Rb is down regulated upon CDK4/6 inhibition. More-
over, levels of exogenous Rb under the control of
a CMV promoter were not affected upon treatment
indicating that CDK4/6 inhibitors influence the RB1
promoter activity to result in transcription reduction
[30]. Molecules such as members of the Rb family
(Rb, p107 and 130) or E2F proteins, which can bind
to the RB1 promoter, could potentially be involved in
this mechanism [49–51].
We also tested if this effect depends on the protea-
somal degradation of Rb. The addition of MG-132,
a proteasomal inhibitor, did not rescue Rb from
degradation after CDK4/6 inhibition, indicating that
the decrease in total Rb protein level might not be
predominantly regulated by the proteasome. Most
proteasome inhibitors exhibit very high cytotoxic
activity. We used MG-132 at a concentration of 100
nM where it did not exhibit cytotoxic activity in
cell viability assays but should specifically inacti-
vate proteasome activity according to the literature
[52]. However, a comprehensive examination of the
proteasome as part of the biochemical response to
CDK4/6 inhibitors needs to be performed.
Functional effects of CDK4/6 inhibition on cell
cycle arrest and senescence
All published reports have demonstrated that
CDK4/6 inhibitors are capable of arresting cells in the
G0/G1 phase. However, it is important to investigate
whether these agents are capable of inducing senes-
cence, which represents a state of permanent and
irreversible cell cycle arrest [53]. It has been reported
that CDK4/6 inhibition for 3 days or longer, can
initiate senescence in vitro and in vivo in a subpop-
ulation of examined tumor cells [54–60]. However,
since the induction of senescence is incomplete, the
senescence-resistantsubclonesareabletore-enterthe
cell cycle upon the removal of CDK4/6 inhibition.
In vivo, chronic CDK4/6 inhibition failed to confer a
permanent cell cycle arrest of tumor cells even after
initial stable disease control [58, 61].
Early adaption to CDK4/6 inhibition was also
observed in leukemia, breast cancer and liposarcoma
cells [61–63]. Upon acute CDK4/6 inhibition repre-
sentative cell lines of these tumor entities (MCF-7,
U937, THP1) showed 24 hours after treatment a bet-
ter inhibition of Rb phosphorylation and cell cycle
arrest than at later time points where a partial recov-
ery could be observed. This has been demonstrated to
result from a compensatory activation of the CDK2
pathway, probably due to increased adaptive PI3K
signaling or down regulation of p27Kip1 [61, 63].
Cells can also acquire Rb mutations during long term
treatment which correlates with therapy resistance,
indicating that an appropriate combination or sequen-
tial therapy design is necessary to overcome such
resistance mechanims [61].
Some studies have also reported functional effects
of CDK4/6 inhibition on inducing apoptosis and
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [41, 42,
44, 46, 64]. Abemaciclib (LY2835219) could induce
massive apoptosis in a tumor-derived vemurafenib-
resistant melanoma cell line, while no apoptosis was
observed in its parental cell line [64]. Prolonged treat-
ment with PD-0332991 for 5 days induced apoptosis
in a proportion of ovarian cancer cells [44]. CDK4/6
inhibition could induce EMT and enhanced the inva-
sion of SMAD-4 wild-type pancreatic cancer cells
through activation of the TGF-beta pathway [42].
Additional investigations are warranted into these
phenotypes to understand how they impact the overall
anti-tumor effect of these agents.

Potential predictive and stratifying biomarkers
for personalizing CDK4/6 target therapy
It is likely that various molecular mechanisms
regulate the sensitivity or resistance to CDK4/6
inhibitors.
Their
identification
can
enable
the
development of stratifying molecular biomarkers
according to tumor genetics. Preclinical studies have
unanimously demonstrated that only Rb expressing
cells respond to CDK4/6 inhibitors based mainly
on correlation studies in Rb positive or negative
cell lines [29, 30, 39, 44, 57, 65, 66]. Our group
demonstrated that reconstitution of recombinant Rb
protein in Rb negative cells fails to sensitize them
to CDK4/6 inhibition [30]. RNAi-mediated silenc-
ing of Rb in Rb-expressing cells induces resistance
to CDK4/6 inhibition [62]. One study also demon-
strated by using a retrovirus that stably expresses
microRNAs against Rb that CDK4/6 inhibitors medi-
ate their effects independent of Rb expression [45,
67]. These seemingly contradictory findings might
be explained by differences in cell cycle regula-
tion in Rb positive and negative cells. For instance,
Rb deficient cells can regulate the G1/S transition
independent of the CDK4/6-Rb pathway and these
inhibitors might be ineffective despite Rb reconsti-
tution [26, 68, 69]. Conversely, acute Rb loss using
RNAi might not mirror the molecular pathways that
are active in intrinsically Rb negative cells and could
also be compensated by p107 or p130 Rb family
members [45, 67]. Hence, the direct assessment of
the contribution of Rb expression to the response to
CDK4/6 inhibitors remains challenging.
Apart from Rb expression, correlation studies sug-
gest that loss of p16INK4A, overexpression of cyclin
D1, amplification of CDK4 and down regulation of
MDM2 are associated with sensitivity to CDK4/6
inhibitors in different cancer models [39, 41, 44, 47,
54, 56, 65, 70]. Increased expression of E2F1, com-
pensatory activation of the CDK2 pathway via up
regulation of cyclin D1, E or A, as well as increased
PI3K and MAPK signaling have all been associated
with resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors [5, 40, 44, 45,
63, 67, 71–74].
Preliminary genetic analyses from tumors under-
going treatment in clinical trials also provide
information about potential biomarkers. CDK4/6
inhibitors showed significant clinical benefit in tri-
als of advanced estrogen receptor (ER) positive
breast cancer, which is commonly Rb positive, and
well differentiated or de-differentiated liposarcoma,
which is commonly Rb positive and CDK4 ampli-
fied [31–35, 75]. However, since some patients did
not show clinical benefit, it is likely that other
molecular alterations also play a role in determining
response to treatment. While ER expression was sig-
nificantly associated with response to palbociclib in
combination with hormone therapy in breast cancer,
additional biomarkers such as CCND1 amplification
or CDKN2A loss were not predictive of response [32,
75]. No obvious association was seen between alter-
ations in cell cycle genes such as CCND1, CDKN2A,
CDKN2B or CCNE1 and treatment response in early
exploratory analyses in phase 1 studies in various
solid tumors [36, 37]. These data also indicate cor-
relations between alterations in TP53, KRAS, EGFR
and treatment response, which also vary in different
tumor entities [37]. The benefit of these alterations as
stratifying biomarkers needs to be explored in larger
patient cohorts.
Hence, the genetic determinants of response to
CDK4/6 inhibitors are likely to be highly com-
plex and not restricted to obvious molecules that
regulate Rb function, namely CDKN2A, CDKN2B,
CCND1. Future investigations applying advanced
technologies such as functional genomics in preclin-
ical studies and genomic analyses of clinical samples
can potentially lead to the development of a person-
alized medicine strategy for their clinical use. For
mBC, it will also be interesting to analyze if specific
molecularsubtypesinfluencetheresponsetoCDK4/6
inhibition given their distinct association with cell
cycle deregulation.
Combination therapies that might improve the
response to CDK4/6 inhibitors
Stable disease characterized a large proportion of
clinical benefit seen in trials with different CDK4/6
inhibitors, possibly reflecting its cytostatic effect.
Combination therapy with other agents thus has the
potential to improve efficacy by promoting tumor
eradication.Suchstrategiescanalsohelptoovercome
resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Moreover, syner-
gistic combinations can allow for a dose reduction
of individual drugs and have the potential to reduce
toxicity.
This strategy can be used to improve responses
seen with standard chemotherapy regimens. How-
ever, the efficacy of various chemotherapy agents is
dependenet on growth arrest in specific cell cycle
stages. This can lead to either antagonistic, additive
or synergistic effects in combination with CDK4/6
inhibitors, which may also depend on the relative

timing of combination or sequential therapy. We have
observed that the combination of PD-0332991 and
cisplatin have a synergistic effect in mBC cell lines
[30]. Interestingly, this combination has antagonis-
tic effects on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell
growth [40]. Combination of CDK4/6 inhibition with
carboplatin or paclitaxel chemotherapy in ovarian
cancer cells showed additive or synergistic interac-
tions when used concomitantly, while treating cells
with CDK4/6 inhibitors 24 hours before chemother-
apy caused an antagonistic effect [44].
CDK4/6 inhibitors have also been combined with
different targeted therapies. Their combination with
hormone therapy has clearly demonstrated benefit in
preclinical studies and clinical trials in hormone pos-
itive breast cancer. This benefit might stem from the
association between cyclin D1 and Rb phosphoryla-
tion in the pathogenesis and treatment response of
hormone positive breast cancer [76]. Multiple stud-
ies have demonstrated that increased signaling in
the PI3K-mTOR pathway contributes to resistance
to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combinations of CDK4/6
and PI3K pathway inhibitors have shown synergis-
tic effects in reducing proliferation and increasing
senescence [55, 58]. Early data from clinical tri-
als combining CDK4/6 inhibitors, endocrine therapy
and PI3K or mTOR inhibitors has also demonstrated
an acceptable safety profile and preliminary clinical
activity[77,78].Table2showsanoverviewofcurrent
clinical trials that are ongoing to explore the effects
of combination therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors in a
variety of different tumor entities.
CONCLUSIONS
CDK4/6 inhibitors have recently been approved
for clinical use in breast cancer and have an estab-
lished safety profile. Frequent cell cycle deregulation
makes CDK4/6 a compelling target in mBC. We have
demonstrated that CDK4/6 inhibition is a promising
strategy in mBC to limit cellular proliferation and
tumor growth. Palbociclib is also being investigated
in a clinical trial for patients with mBC (clinical trial
identifier NCT02334527). Although CDK4/6 is a
promising target in mBC, further research is required
to improve its adoption in the clinic. We antici-
pate that a thorough understanding of the molecular
mechanismsandfunctionalconsequencesof CDK4/6
inhibition can guide the identification of genetic
determinants of response to these inhibitors. This
can also aid in the development of a personalized
medicine strategy by using stratifying biomarkers. It
should also provide the rationale for the development
of effective combination therapy strategies. Since
alterations in the CDK4/6-Rb pathway correlate with
distinct subtypes of mBC, an intriguing hypothesis
that deserves additional investigation is that CDK4/6
inhibitors might be beneficial in particular molecular
subtypes.
