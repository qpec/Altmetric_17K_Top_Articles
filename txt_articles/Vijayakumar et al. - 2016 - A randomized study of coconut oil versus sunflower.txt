Background and rationale: Coronary artery disease (CAD) and its pathological atherosclerotic
process are closely related to lipids. Lipids levels are in turn influenced by dietary oils and
fats. Saturated fatty acids increase the risk for atherosclerosis by increasing the cholesterol
level. This study was conducted to investigate the impact of cooking oil media (coconut oil
and sunflower oil) on lipid profile, antioxidant mechanism, and endothelial function in
patients with established CAD.
Design and methods: In a single center randomized study in India, patients with stable CAD on
standard medical care were assigned to receive coconut oil (Group I) or sunflower oil (Group
II) as cooking media for 2 years. Anthropometric measurements, serum, lipids, Lipoprotein a,
apo B/A-1 ratio, antioxidants, flow-mediated vasodilation, and cardiovascular events were
assessed at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.
Results: Hundred patients in each arm completed 2 years with 98% follow-up. There was no
statistically significant difference in the anthropometric, biochemical, vascular function,
and in cardiovascular events after 2 years.
Conclusion: Coconut oil even though rich in saturated fatty acids in comparison to sunflower
oil when used as cooking oil media over a period of 2 years did not change the lipid-related
cardiovascular risk factors and events in those receiving standard medical care.

Introduction
Coronary artery disease (CAD) resulting from atherosclerosis is
closely associated with serum lipids.1–3 Dietary fats and oils
influence the metabolism of lipids and increase the chance of
CAD if the hyperlipidemic state persists for a long time.
Atherogenic dyslipidemia is constituted by increased low-
density lipoproteins (LDL), reduced high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) and elevated triglycerides. In a recent study of (Md-CCC)
by principle component analysis, it is shown that this type of
metabolic abnormality is predictive of atherosclerosis and
cardiovascular disesae.4 Since 1963 after the Framing harm
heart trial, the fats and oils containing saturated fatty acids are
considered one of the important causes for CAD.5 Aggressive
lipid lowering strategies have shown reduced morbidity and
mortality from CAD.6 Though the management of dyslipide-
mia by lipid lowering drugs is very effective,7–10 modulating
HDL to therapeutically significant level is not yet achieved.11
Genetic factors, life style, and dietary habits are responsible for
the geographical variations in serum lipids. Most of the time,
the concern regarding the dietary oil begins after the occurrence
of a cardiac event or being diagnosed as having CAD.
1.1. 
Cooking oil media
CAD prevalence and risk factors are significantly high in the
state of Kerala among the Indian states due to various
reasons.12,13 One of the contributing factors is proposed to
be the saturated fatty acids contained in coconut oil which is
the most commonly used cooking oil media. Sunflower oil rich
in polyunsaturated fatty acids have become the second
preferred cooking oil media over last few years. Polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids in sunflower oil affect the lipid metabolism in
a favorable manner. The oil and fat usage in a given population
is influenced by the tradition, availability, and socioeconomic
status and to certain extent the awareness.
1.2. 
The medium chain fatty acids and CAD
The medium chain fatty acids metabolism is different from the
long chain fatty acids present in other fats and oil.14,15 There
are only epidemiological data and small short-term interven-
tions with the coconut oil and its association with CAD.16–18
Previous work from our institution showed that there were no
differences in lipid profile (serum total cholesterol, triacylgly-
cerols, and cholesterol in lipoprotein fractions) between
persons taking coconut oil or sunflower oil.19 Higher intake
of coconut oil did not cause any significant increase in the
concentration of lauric acid in blood among coconut oil
consumers. Moreover, serum lipid values did not show
significant variation between animals fed with coconut oil or
sunflower oil. Coconut oil intake did not cause hypercholester-
olemia or oxidative stress in rabbits.20In another study, the fatty
acid content of the coronary plaque (endarterectomy specimen)
did not show any difference between coconut oil consumers
versus sunflower oil consumers.21 Since these studies were
done in free living subjects, many compounding factors like
eating outside, quantity of oil, duration of consumption, and
physical activity could not be assessed correctly.
In this context, a study evaluating the impact of coconut oil
on cardiovascular events and risk factors as a cooking oil
media in the community is warranted. In this study, we
evaluated the impact of coconut oil and sunflower oil as a
cooking medium on the cardiovascular events and risk factors
in patients with stable coronary heart disease receiving the
standard medical care.
2. 
Materials and method
2.1. 
Design
Randomized single blinded clinical trial.
2.2. 
Sample size
Since this is the first of this kind of study with cooking oil
media, no publications could be located in the existing
literature and hence this was taken as a pilot study. A total
of 200 patients satisfying the criteria for recruitment were
randomly allocated to two groups. Block randomization was
done with 5 blocks each having 40 cases for allocation. This
was done just to avoid the non-availability of required sample
size and to keep randomization live with the available number
of patients. However, 200 patients were available at the end
of study.
2.3. 
Subjects
The subjects were selected from the patients attending the
outpatient department of our hospital as per the selection
criteria. CAD was diagnosed by various methods like coronary
angiogram, Echocardiography, ECG evidence of myocardial
infarction, stress perfusion scan, and multidetector coronary
angiogram. Subjects were included in the study if they achieve
optimal control of diabetes and lipid levels. Patients with
uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal failure creatinine >2 mg/dl
and liver failure, and other illness limiting the life expectancy
<2 years were excluded.
Approval from scientific committee and institutional ethic
committee was obtained as per guidelines. All subjects signed
informed consent before randomization.
The funding agencies were (1) Coconut development board
– India and (2) Amrita Institute of Medical Science and
Research Center. None of the sponsors had any role in the
study design and data analysis.
2.4. 
Anthropometric measurements
2.4.1. 
Body mass index
Height was measured with subjects in bare foot using
standardized extendable measuring rod. Weight was mea-
sured with an electronic Dura weighing machine during empty
stomach.
2.4.2. 
Percentage body fat
Skin fold thickness was measured with a Harpenden skin fold
caliper by using a three-site system in this study. For men it
was triceps, subscapular and chest whereas in women triceps,
i n d i a n h e a r t j o u r n a l 6 8 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 4 9 8 – 5 0 6 
499
 abdomen, and suprailiac sites were used. These measure-
ments were then used in the Siri equation to derive the
percentage body fat.
2.4.3. 
Waist hip ratio
Waist circumference was measured with the patient in the
held expiration position midway between the twelfth rib and
anterior superior iliac spine. The hip measurement was taken
at the level of greater trochanter.
2.5. 
Dietary intervention
Each arm containing 100 patients was assigned to branded
commercial coconut oil or sunflower oil as per block randomi-
zation. The oils were given to subjects as well as to the family
members so as to ensure the compliance. The subjects were
asked to use the assigned oil for cooking. A 24 h dietary recall
was applied to all subjects before the commencement of the
study to test their dietary pattern. The total energy require-
ments and the amount of oil required to meet 15% of daily
calories were calculated on the basis of 24 h recall. During the
study, 7 day recall and a diet diary were used to monitor the
adherence of study subjects to the assigned oil and food pattern.
2.6. 
Flow-mediated vasodilatation
Noninvasive endothelial function assessment was carried out
with flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) of brachial artery.
Ischemia 
was 
induced 
by 
inflating 
sphygmomanometer
pressure cuff for 5 min over forearm (distal occlusion) by
50 mmHg above the systolic pressure in a fasting state.
Imaging of brachial artery was done using a 7–12 MHz linear
array transducer fixed to a custom-made probe holder. ECG
Gated images of the brachial artery were acquired with Sonos
5000 (Philips) prior to inflation and 15 s before deflation to
1 min after deflation. Offline analysis was carried out to find
out maximum post-deflation diameter and from these values
absolute increase and the percentage increase in diameter
were calculated.
2.7. 
Biochemical parameters
Lipid profile was estimated after 12 h of overnight fasting as
per hospital protocol. Total cholesterol was estimated by
cholesterol oxidase, esterase, peroxidase method. HDL cho-
lesterol was by direct measurement using immune-inhibition.
LDL cholesterol estimation was done by cholesterol oxidase,
esterase, peroxidase method and the VLDL cholesterol was
calculated. In our study, triglycerides were estimated by
enzymatic end point method. Colorimetric method was used
to estimate non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA).
Lipoprotein a (Lpa), apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A, and
ultrasensitive reactive protein were estimated by immuno-
turbidometry.
Glycosylated hemoglobin was measured by HPLC.
2.8. 
Antioxidants-hemolysate preparation
Five clinically important antioxidants were estimated at
different time intervals. After separation of the plasma, the
blood cells were washed with 3 ml of cold normal saline (0.9%
NaCl), centrifuged, and supernatant discarded. This was
repeated for 2 more times. The cells were made up to 30 ml
with ice cold distilled water and stored in refrigerator. All 5
parameters were estimated by photo metrical method from
this hemolysate by allowing to react with corresponding
reagents.

Results
From August 2009 to April 2014, 200 patients were recruited
(Fig. 1). Group I – Coconut oil, Group II – Sunflower oil.
As in any other CAD study, the male population was
predominant. Among the conventional risk factors, the most
common one was dyslipidemia (Table 2). Most of the patients
in each group were asymptomatic and were leading active life
style. Significant number of patients in each group 61.6% and
56.2% had undergone percutaneous revascularization while
more than 20% were post-coronary artery bypass graft
patients. Even though the two groups appear very much
heterogeneous, statistically they are comparable.
The body mass index in both groups were comparable at
the end of 2 years. The percentage body fat calculated by
substituting the skin fold thickness into Siri equation in both
groups was not different statistically (Table 3).
Traditional lipid profile estimation (Table 4) carried out in
both groups at baseline, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years did not
show statistically significant differences in both the groups.
Lpa levels were 21.81 � 21.89 and 25.13 � 28.73 at the
beginning of the study and at the end of the study, the values
were 22.46 � 20.24 and 30.64 � 31.13 in Group I and in Group II,
respectively. Even though statistically not significant, Lpa was
slightly high in Group II (Table 5).
The ratio of atherogenic and non-atherogenic lipoprotein in
both study groups at baseline was in low risk group and did not
show difference at 2 years.
FMD as surrogate marker of endothelial function was
comparable at the end of the study in both groups (Table 6).
Five important antioxidants enzymes estimated in our
study, which are related to the oxidative stress, remain
comparable at baseline, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years (Table 7).
One of the inflammatory markers assessed in atheroscle-
rotic CAD is ultra-sensitive C reactive. The anti-inflammatory
response assessed by evaluating hCRP at the baseline and end
of the study remains statistically comparable even though
there is reduction in Group I which is statistically not
significant (Table 8).
Glycosylated hemoglobin as the marker for diabetic control
was not influenced by either oil during 2-year study period
(Table 9).
Out of 200 patients on standard medical treatment, 2 in
each group underwent revascularization. Deaths in Group I
were due to road traffic accidents (Table 10).
All of our patients were on different types statins as
prescribed at the time of CAD diagnosis. Those patients with
lipid levels at ATP III level were only included in the study.
Atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin were the three
major groups of lipid lowering drugs and a small fraction of
patients were on fibrates and nicotinic acid (Table 11).

Discussion
Nothing has been discussed as much as role of ideal oil media
in primary and secondary prevention of CAD.22–24 Concern
regarding the oil media for cooking starts growing in those
sustaining a cardiovascular event or after CAD diagnosis. This
particular study was designed to address the effect of coconut
oil and sunflower on cardiovascular risk factors in those
diagnosed to have CAD. Atherosclerotic CAD prevalence is
quite high in this densely populated state where coconut oil is
used for cooking traditionally. Prescreening survey shows that
>65% of these patients were using coconut oil. Even though it
appears that the population is very heterogeneous in respect
to the profile of CAD, treatment, and medications, statistically
they are comparable (Table 1). About 90% of the population
was on mixed diet. Dietary intervention in atherosclerosis is
difficult for reasons such as longer duration for the impact to
be evident, marinating the compliance till end of the study,
and to balance other contributing factors. Reasons for the
delay in the recruitment were due to: (1) patients decision to
change over to a particular oil; (2) family acceptance to the
need for special cooking; and (3) behavioral modification to
ensure home eating. In dietary interventions, adherence to the
particular diet and monitoring of the same is very important.
In this study, the following effective and widely used tools25–27
were used to assess the compliance to the oil assigned: (a) 24 h
recall, (b) 7 day recall, and (c) a diet dairy.
Anthropometric measurements like BMI, waist hip ratio,
and percentage body fat reflect the risk for atherosclerosis.28,29
Abdominal obesity is quite common in this community that
seems to be determined genetically but influenced by diet and

 exercise. In our study, these parameters remained comparable
throughout the study (Table 3).
Lipids assessed at various intervals (baseline, 3 months, 12
months, and 24 months) show no statistically significant
difference between both groups. Median chain saturated fatty
acids in coconut oil do not seem to increase the lipids when
compared with polyunsaturated fatty acids of sunflower oil
when consumed along medication including statins. This is
the real world scenario in this community with majority of
patients continuing to use coconut oil even after being
diagnosed to have atherosclerotic CAD. The primary objective
of our study was to assess whether this traditional cooking oil
media influence the CAD risk factors unfavorably in spite of
medication. As the traditional lipid profile reflects only a part
of atherogenic burden30 to assess the atherogenic versus non-
atherogenic lipids, apolipoprotein B and A were evaluated in
the study population. Even though apo B/A-1 ratio showed a
progressive increase throughout the study, there was no
statistically significant difference between both the arms
throughout the study. As the apo B/A ratio is between 0.5 and
0.7 in this study, our population can be categorized into a
moderate risk group as per the risk line based on the results
from AMORIS and INTERHEART studies.31,32 NEFA is an
independent cardiovascular risk factor which predict cardio-
vascular events including sudden death.33 In these study
groups at the end of 2 years, there was no statistically
significant 
difference 
in 
NEFA 
indicating 
that 
the 
free
circulating free fatty acids are not influenced by either oil.
Lpa estimated in this study remains below the lower limit of

 the established levels of risk stratification.33 Even though
determined genetically, there are reports indicating that the
dietary and pharmacological intervention changes the profile
of this pro-atherogenic component.34,35 The present study did
not show any effect on Lpa either by sunflower oil or coconut
oil.
Oxidized LDL cholesterol promotes atherosclerosis in many
ways.36 Free radicals are generated during the metabolism of
substance like fatty acids. Antioxidants of clinical importance
in cardiovascular diseases, which are scavengers37 of free
radicals estimated at different time points in both arms,
remained statistically comparable. The normal values of these
enzymes are not well established in this particular population
but we compared baseline level with enzymes levels at
different time intervals to assess the status of redox potential.
Atherosclerosis is closely related to systemic inflammation.
Various epidemiological studies have shown the association of
increased CRP and cardiovascular disease.38,39 One of the best
indicators of systemic inflammations used in cardiovascular
risk assessment is high-sensitive C-reactive protein.40 The
baselines CRP in our study group indicates that this population
is having an average risk as per AHA and CDC and none of the
oil seems to influence it on long-term use.
Diabetic control seems to be one of the measures to arrest
the progression of atherosclerosis.41 Our study patients seem
to have tight control of diabetes as the baseline glycosylated
hemoglobin levels were <7, probably due to regular follow-up
and strict adherence to medication since being diagnosed to
have CAD. Virgin coconut oil has shown to have beneficial
effect in diabetes mellitus patients.42 Ordinary coconut oil and
sunflower oil used for 2 years did not show any influence on
the glycemic levels of the study subjects.
FMD is the surrogate indicator of endothelial functions
which depends on many factors including the oxidative
stress.43,44 Ischemia-induced vasodilatation of brachial artery
in our study utilized the compression of arm by sphygmoma-
nometer. The absolute and percentage increase in diameter of
brachial artery did not show statistically significant difference
in both these groups. As there are no established normal
values for this response in this population, we compared
values at different time intervals with the baseline value.
In any dietary intervention of atherosclerosis, the hard end
points like myocardial infarction, death, and stroke are of
paramount importance. Two deaths in Group I were due to
road traffic accidents. There was no myocardial infarction in
either group during the study period. Repeat revascularization

revascularization rate in other trials.
Statin is prescribed for all patients with established CAD,
probably due to its pleomorphic effect irrespective of the level
of cholesterol level. For the same reason, lipid modulating
dietary interventions are possible only along with the statin
therapy in CAD patients. Monitoring the level of lipids and the
dose of statins to maintain the lipid level at the recommended
level is only alternative in this real world scenario. The statin
dose and the type of statin required to maintain the lipid level
did not change during the 2 years of study period.
5. 
Statistical analysis
Mean and the standard deviation of all the measurable
variables were calculated for patients in the two groups. To
test the statistical significance of difference in mean values of
all variables, Student's t-test was done. In case the sample size
was comparatively smaller for certain variables, Wilcoxon
rank sum test was done. For categorical variables to study their
association with type of oil (Group I and Group II), statistical
test done was chi-square test.

Conclusion
Coconut oil even though rich in saturated fatty acids in
comparison to sunflower oil when used as cooking oil media
over a period of 2 years did not change the lipid-related
cardiovascular risk factors and events in those receiving
standard medical care.
7. 
Limitations
(1) This dietary intervention population is very small to assess
a community issue. (2) The outcome is likely to be influenced
by medication. (3) 2 Years duration of dietary intervention may
not be sufficient enough to commend on major cardiac events.
8. 
Future prospective
A 
long-term 
community-based/family-based 
prospective
study in normal free living population is necessary to answer
the cardiovascular effect of coconut oil, as there are no such
data available. Also, it is necessary to evaluate the same in
different ethnic population in Asia Pacific region where
coconut oil is produced and used in large scale.
