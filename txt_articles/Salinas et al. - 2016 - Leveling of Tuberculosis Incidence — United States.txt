After 2 decades of progress toward tuberculosis (TB) elimina-
tion with annual decreases of ≥0.2 cases per 100,000 persons 
(1), TB incidence in the United States remained approximately 
3.0 cases per 100,000 persons during 2013–2015. Preliminary 
data reported to the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System 
indicate that TB incidence among foreign-born persons in 
the United States (15.1 cases per 100,000) has remained 
approximately 13 times the incidence among U.S.-born per-
sons (1.2 cases per 100,000). Resuming progress toward TB 
elimination in the United States will require intensification 
of efforts both in the United States and globally, including 
increasing U.S. efforts to detect and treat latent TB infection,

World TB Day — March 24, 2016
World TB Day is recognized each year on 
March 24, which commemorates the date in 1882 
when Dr. Robert Koch announced his discovery of 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacillus that causes 
tuberculosis (TB). World TB Day is an opportunity 
to raise awareness about TB and support worldwide 
TB prevention and control efforts. The U.S. theme 
for World TB Day, “Unite to End TB,” highlights 
how much more needs to be done to eliminate TB in 
the United States.
After 2 decades of annual declines, TB incidence in 
the United States has leveled at approximately 3.0 new 
cases per 100,000 persons. (1,2). The determinants of 
this leveling in TB incidence are not yet clear; further 
evaluation of available data is required to understand 
the causes of this trend.
CDC is committed to eliminating TB in the United 
States. Staying on the path toward TB elimination 
will require more intensive efforts, both in the United 
States and globally. These efforts will not only focus 
on strengthening existing systems for interrupting TB 
transmission, but also on increasing testing and treat-
ment of persons with latent TB infection. Additional 
information about World TB Day and CDC’s TB 
elimination activities is available on CDC’s website 
(http://www.cdc.gov/tb/worldtbday).

strengthening systems to interrupt TB transmission in the 
United States and globally, accelerating reductions in TB glob-
ally, particularly in the countries of origin for most U.S. cases.
Health departments in the 50 states and District of Columbia 
(DC) electronically report verified TB cases that meet the CDC 
and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case defi-
nition to the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (2). 
Reports include the patient’s demographic information, medi-
cal and social risk factors for TB, and clinical information about 
the TB case. U.S.-born persons are defined as persons born 
in the United States, American Samoa, the Federated States 
of Micronesia, Guam, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto 
Rico, the Republic of Palau, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and U.S. 
minor outlying islands, or persons born elsewhere to a U.S. 
citizen (3). Race/ethnicity is self-identified. Persons of Hispanic 
ethnicity might be of any race or multiple races; non-Hispanic 
persons are categorized by race. CDC calculates state and 
overall national TB incidence by using July 1 midyear popula-
tion estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau (3). The Current 
Population Survey provides the population denominators for 
incidence according to national origin and race/ethnicity (4). 
TB case counts and incidence per 100,000 population during 
2015 and percent change from 2014 were calculated for the 
50 states and DC and for each census division.
As they did during the previous 7 years, four states 
(California, Florida, New York, and Texas) reported >500 cases 
each in 2015 (Table 1). Together, these four states accounted 
for 4,839 TB cases, or approximately half (50.6%) of all 
reported cases. State-specific incidence ranged from 0.5 cases 
per 100,000 persons (West Virginia) to 9.1 TB cases per 
100,000 persons (Alaska) (median state incidence = 2.0). By 
census division, the highest TB incidence was reported in the 
Middle Atlantic, West South Central, and Pacific divisions. The 
largest increases in TB incidence from 2014 to 2015 occurred 
in the East North Central, New England, Mountain, and West 
South Central divisions.
Among the 9,563 TB cases reported during 2015, 3,201 
(33.5%) occurred among U.S.-born persons, corresponding to 
an annual TB incidence of 1.2 per 100,000 persons. The 6,335 
TB cases among foreign-born persons in the United States 
(66.2% of the total U.S. cases) corresponded to an annual 
TB incidence of 15.1 per 100,000 persons (Table 2). Overall 
national TB incidence remained approximately 3.0 cases per 
100,000 persons during 2013–2015 (Figure).
In 2015, most U.S.-born persons reported with TB were 
either non-Hispanic blacks (1,144 cases) or non-Hispanic 
whites (991 cases) (Table 2). Among U.S.-born non-Hispanic 
blacks, TB incidence was at an all-time low (3.3 cases per 
100,000 persons). Incidence among U.S.-born non-His-
panic whites remained the lowest (0.5 cases per 100,000). 
Although U.S.-born Hispanics had the third highest case 
count (661 cases), they had the second lowest incidence 
(1.8 cases per 100,000). U.S.-born Native Hawaiians/other 
Pacific Islanders had the highest incidence (12.7 cases per 
100,000), followed by U.S.-born American Indians/Alaska

Natives (6.8 cases per 100,000). A total of 344 TB cases 
occurred among U.S.-born persons aged <15 years (0.6 cases 
per 100,000), representing 10.7% of all U.S.-born persons 
reported as having incident TB in 2015.
In 2015, among foreign-born persons with reported TB 
in the United States, Asians had both the highest case count 
(3,007 cases) and highest incidence (28.2 cases per 100,000 
persons). The top five countries of origin for foreign-born per-
sons with TB were Mexico (n = 1,250; 19.7%), the Philippines 
(n = 819; 12.9%), India (n = 578; 9.1%), Vietnam (n = 513; 
8.1%), and China (n = 424; 6.7%). Together, these countries 
represent 45.2% of the foreign-born population in the United 
States (4), but accounted for 56.6% (3,584 cases) of all TB 
cases among foreign-born persons. Although Mexico-born 
persons accounted for the largest proportion of foreign-born 
persons reported with TB, their TB incidence in the United 
States (10.4 cases per 100,000) was lower than that among 
persons born in China (24.9 cases per 100,000), India (23.9 
cases per 100,000), the Philippines (46.9 cases per 100,000), 
and Vietnam (47.8 cases per 100,000). From 2014 to 2015, 
the number of TB cases among Philippines-born persons 
grew from 755 to 819 (8.5% increase), and the number of 
TB cases among India-born persons grew from 479 to 578 
(20.7% increase). The Philippines-born population in the 
United States grew from 1,639,286 to 1,747,287 (population 
growth of 6.6%), and the India-born population grew from 
2,166,930 to 2,421,795 (population growth of 11.8%) (4).

 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 
276 
MMWR / March 25, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 11
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Ninety-six TB cases occurred among foreign-born persons 
aged <15 years (6.0 cases per 100,000), representing 1.5% of 
all foreign-born persons reported as having incident TB in the 
United States in 2015.
Discussion
After 2 decades of annual declines (1), TB incidence in the 
United States has leveled at approximately 3.0 new cases per 
100,000 persons. Epidemiologic modeling suggests that even 
if the previously observed annual declines in the United States 
had been sustained, TB elimination, defined as <1 TB case per 
one million persons annually (5), would not occur by the end 
of this century (6). The determinants of this leveling in TB 
incidence are not yet clear; further evaluation of available data 
is required to understand the causes of this trend.
The 1985–1992 TB resurgence was attributed to the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome epidemic, immigration from countries with higher 
TB incidence, and increased TB transmission within the 
United States (7). However, the proportion of TB patients 
coinfected with HIV has declined substantially in the United 
States (5.6% of TB patients in 2015 with known HIV status 
were coinfected, including 7.8% of the U.S.-born), and TB 
incidence among U.S. foreign-born persons has continued 
to decline (1). In contrast, the stabilization of TB incidence 
among U.S.-born persons (Table 2), together with evidence 
provided by molecular genotyping of TB cases (1,8), demon-
strates that TB transmission within the United States continues 
to occur. The continued occurrence of TB cases among U.S.-
born children is further corroboration, because TB disease in 
a young child is a sentinel event representing recent infection 
(5,7). Substance abuse, incarceration, and homelessness asso-
ciated with TB outbreaks highlight some of the complicated 
case management work required on the health department 
frontlines of TB control (9).

to 1.36 cases), declined 8.8% in 2013 (to 1.24 cases), declined 6.0% in 2014 (to 1.16 cases), and increased 0.3% in 2015 (to 1.17 cases). TB incidence per 100,000 
foreign-born population declined 5.9% from 2011 to 2012 (from 16.91 to 15.90), declined 1.8% in 2013 (to 15.61 cases), declined 1.1% in 2014 (to 15.43 cases), and 
declined 2.3% in 2015 (to 15.08 cases).
 ** Other includes a total of four persons reported as American Indians/Alaska Natives (one in 2012, two in 2013, zero in 2014, one in 2015) and a total of 51 as Native 
Hawaiians/other Pacific Islanders (12 in 2012, 17 in 2013, eight in 2014, 14 in 2015).
 †† The provisional number of TB cases for 2014 was 9,412, which corresponded to an incidence of 2.951 per 100,000 persons (i.e., rounded up to 3.0); the updated 
number of TB cases for 2014 is 9,406, which corresponds to an incidence of 2.949 cases per 100,000 persons (i.e., rounds down to 2.9).

Effective TB control requires diagnosing cases as early as 
possible during the illness, thus allowing earlier airborne 
precautions and curative treatment to interrupt transmission 
(5,9). An early diagnosis for a patient with infectious TB also 
permits a timely contact investigation, which is essential to 
detect and prevent additional TB cases. Recently infected 
contacts, particularly children, benefit greatly from treatment 
to avert progression to active TB disease (5,7). TB prevention, 
timely diagnosis, and treatment completion are necessary for all 
groups, but especially for groups disproportionally affected by 
TB. Since 2003, TB incidence among Native Hawaiians/other 
Pacific Islanders and American Indians/Alaska Natives has 
remained high despite declining incidence among Hispanics 
and non-Hispanic Asians, whites, and blacks (1).
Two thirds of all U.S. TB cases occur among foreign-born 
persons, often years after arrival (10), which is consistent with 
disease progression following years of untreated latent TB 
infection. Epidemiologic modeling indicates that eliminating 
the threat of TB in the United States will require additional 
strategies to reduce TB in the countries of origin and expand 
treatment of latent TB infection among the foreign-born 
persons (6). Despite recent declines in TB incidence among 
foreign-born persons, these persons continue to have a higher 
risk for TB, reflecting the importance of further intensifying the 
global battle against TB and underscoring the importance of 
interventions to screen and treat U.S.-bound permanent immi-
grants and refugees for TB disease. TB elimination will require 
both global interventions and a substantial improvement in 
larger scale identification and treatment of latent TB infection 
among foreign-born persons living in the United States (6), 
consistent with CDC’s strategic plan for the national elimina-
tion of TB (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/about/strategicplan.htm).
TB is preventable and curable, and its elimination would 
have widespread health, economic, and social benefits. 
Resuming declines in TB incidence will require more compre-
hensive public health approaches, both globally and domesti-
cally. These include increasing case detection and cure rates 
globally, reducing TB transmission in institutional settings such 
as health care settings and correctional facilities, and increas-
ing detection and treatment of preexisting latent TB infection 
among the U.S. populations most affected by TB. Finally, 
more emphasis should be placed on interrupting the relatively 
limited, but persistent, ongoing TB transmission (e.g., among 
persons experiencing homelessness) in the United States, as well

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Uniform national reporting of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the 
United States began in 1953. During 1993–2012, the annual 
incidence of reported TB cases has always been ≥0.2 cases per 
100,000 persons lower than the previous year.
What is added by this report?
Preliminary data for 2015 indicate an incidence of 3.0 cases 
per 100,000 persons, approximately the same incidence as 
during 2013 and 2014. After 2 decades of declining incidence, 
progress toward TB elimination in the United States appears to 
have stalled.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Resuming declines in TB incidence in the United States will 
require intensification of efforts both domestically and 
globally. More emphasis should be placed on strengthening 
U.S. systems for detecting and treating latent TB infection and 
interrupting TB transmission, as well as accelerating reduc-
tions in TB globally.
