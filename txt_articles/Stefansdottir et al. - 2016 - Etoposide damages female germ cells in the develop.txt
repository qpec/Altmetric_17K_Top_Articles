Abstract
Background: As with many anti-cancer drugs, the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide is considered safe for
administration to women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, but assessment of effects on the developing
fetus have been limited. The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of etoposide on germ cells in the
developing ovary. Mouse ovary tissue culture was used as the experimental model, thus allowing us to examine effects of
etoposide on all stages of germ cell development in the same way, in vitro.
Results: Fetal ovaries from embryonic day 13.5 CD1 mice or neonatal ovaries from postnatal day 0 CD1 mice were
cultured with 50–150 ng ml−1 or 50–200 ng ml−1 etoposide respectively, concentrations that are low relative to that in
patient serum. When fetal ovaries were treated prior to follicle formation, etoposide resulted in dose-dependent damage,
with 150 ng ml−1 inducing a near-complete absence of healthy follicles. In contrast, treatment of neonatal ovaries, after
follicle formation, had no effect on follicle numbers and only a minor effect on follicle health, even at 200 ng ml−1. The
sensitivity of female germ cells to etoposide coincided with topoisomerase IIα expression: in the developing ovary of
both mouse and human, topoisomerase IIα was expressed in germ cells only prior to follicle formation.
Conclusions: Exposure of pre-follicular ovaries, in which topoisomerase IIα expression was germ cell-specific, resulted
in a near-complete elimination of germ cells prior to follicle formation, with the remaining germ cells going on to form
unhealthy follicles by the end of culture. In contrast, exposure to follicle-enclosed oocytes, which no longer expressed
topoisomerase IIα in the germ cells, had no effect on total follicle numbers or health, the only effect seen specific to
transitional follicles. Results indicate the potential for adverse effects on fetal ovarian development if etoposide is
administered to pregnant women when germ cells are not yet enclosed within ovarian follicles, a process that starts at
approximately 17 weeks gestation and is only complete towards the end of pregnancy.

Background
Cancer is diagnosed in approximately one out of every
1000
pregnancies,
often
requiring
consideration
of
chemotherapy administration to the pregnant woman
[1–4]. Chemotherapy administration during the first tri-
mester is now largely avoided, as it is associated with in-
creased risk of congenital malformations and high risk
of spontaneous abortion [5]. However, it is now widely
considered that chemotherapy treatment during the sec-
ond and third trimesters of pregnancy is relatively safe
for the developing fetus (for example, [6–8]), with
several studies showing no congenital malformations in
infants born to women receiving chemotherapy at that
time [1, 3, 5, 6]. Associations have however been made
between chemotherapy treatment during pregnancy and
increased risk of intrauterine growth restriction, miscar-
riage, preeclampsia and stillbirth [4, 9].
Effects of chemotherapy agents on ovarian function
and fertility in girls and young women treated for cancer
are well recognised and may result in infertility and pre-
mature ovarian insufficiency (POI) [10, 11]. In contrast,
there is a distinct lack of information on the long-term
effects of chemotherapy treatment on the future fertility
of female fetuses when exposure occurs during the par-
ticularly vulnerable window of female germ cell develop-
ment during fetal life [12], although cyclophosphamide

 exposure in utero results in markedly reduced follicle
numbers in neonatal mice [13]. Drug exposure to the
developing ovary could have toxic effects on germ and/
or ovarian somatic cells, with the consequences of such
effects unlikely to manifest themselves until at least after
puberty. Additionally, any genetic damage to germ cells
during fetal development could then be passed on to
subsequent generations, the ‘grand-maternal’ effect [14].
Formation of the gonadal ridge begins around week 7
of human gestation, embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) in the
mouse fetus. Shortly after this, proliferating primordial
germ cells invade the developing ovary. After a further
short proliferative phase, the germ cells initiate meiosis,
which subsequently arrests at the diplotene stage of pro-
phase I. Around that time, the germ cells, now termed
oocytes, interact with surrounding somatic pregranulosa
cells to form primordial follicles (PFs): meiotic arrest
and follicle formation start between weeks 17 to 20 of
human gestation, although follicle formation can con-
tinue until late in pregnancy [15]; in the mouse, oocytes
have entered meiotic arrest by the end of gestation, with
follicle formation occurring around the time of birth. PF
formation, therefore, takes place throughout the second
and into the third trimester of human fetal development,
compared with peri-natal formation in the mouse (Fig. 1).
Once PFs have formed, there is continual ‘release’ of PFs
from that resting follicle pool, follicles then undergoing
growth initiation, with the potential to develop through
to the preovulatory stage. The number of PFs formed
during fetal life is crucial for future fertility, with the size
of the PF pool directly related to a female’s reproductive
lifespan [16].
Etoposide is commonly used in the treatment of ovar-
ian and lung cancers, leukemias and lymphomas. It may
be administered during pregnancy [1, 17, 18], and has
been considered safe for the fetus if given during the
second or third trimester, with births of healthy babies
reported (e.g. [19–21]. However, no data have been re-
ported on possible detrimental effects of etoposide on
the reproductive systems of these children, with none
having yet reached puberty. Etoposide acts by inhibiting
the enzyme type II Topoisomerase (Topo II). Topo II ca-
talyses topological transitions in double-stranded DNA,
and thus influences transcription, DNA replication,
chromosome condensation and the separation of sister
chromatids during mitosis. It creates transient double
strand breaks in DNA, relieving the torsional stress cre-
ated when DNA strands become supercoiled and allow-
ing the passage of the intact DNA segment through the
cleaved strand, after which it re-seals the double strand
break [22–24]. Etoposide acts by interfering with the
ability of Topo II to re-ligate the nick in the DNA
Fig. 1 Timing of ovary development in mouse and human. The gonadal ridge forms during fetal development (i), after which it is invaded by
proliferating primordial germ cells (ii). Meiosis is then initiated, prior to ovarian follicle formation (iii). After entering Prophase I of meiosis, germ cells,
now termed oocytes, become arrested at the dictyate stage of prophase I (iv), at which point they interact with surrounding somatic pregranulosa
cells to form primordial follicles (v). From this point on, follicles gradually leave the resting primordial phase and initiate growth (vi)

 strand, consequently increasing DNA fragmentation and
inducing tumour cell death [25–28]. Mammals express
two functionally distinct Topo II paralogues: Topo IIα
and Topo IIβ. Topo IIα has a widespread role in resolv-
ing replication-induced DNA catenanes in proliferating
cells, whereas Topo IIβ has a more restricted role, at
least in neuronal development, and cannot efficiently
provide the essential function of Topo IIα in proliferat-
ing cells [reviewed in 28]. In the mouse ovary, Topo IIβ
is expressed in oocytes at all developmental stages, with
a low expression in granulosa cells of PFs and a more
pronounced expression in the granulosa cells of growing
follicles [29]. Mice with Topo IIβ conditionally deleted
from their granulosa cells, contain increased cell DNA
damage within the granulosa cells, leading to increased
follicle atresia [29]. In male germ cells, Topo II is re-
quired during prophase I of meiosis [24, 30, 31], with
high levels of chromosomal aberrations present in sper-
matocytes treated with therapeutic doses of etoposide
[32]. These spermatocytes had increased levels of acen-
tric fragments and deletions that are associated with em-
bryonic lethality [32]. In the female, Topo II is required
for chromosome separation during oocyte meiotic mat-
uration, but is dispensable for resumption of meiosis
[31]. However, its role in early stages of female meiosis,
prior to meiotic arrest, remains unclear, as does any ef-
fect of etoposide. If a similar effect on meiosis occurring
in female germ cells to that which occurs in the male
would affect human ovarian development during the
second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
We report here on the effects of etoposide on female
germ cell development. In the mouse, our experimental
model, follicle formation occurs around the time of
birth, thus requiring manipulation of both fetal and neo-
natal ovaries. An initial objective of the work described
here was the development of a mouse fetal ovary culture
system that traverses both fetal and neonatal stages of
germ cell development, thus allowing us to examine ef-
fects of etoposide on all stages of germ cell development
in a consistent manner, in vitro. This novel fetal ovary
culture technique supports survival of pre-meiotic germ
cells, progression through prophase I of meiosis up to
meiotic arrest, followed by follicle formation and subse-
quent growth initiation, and has been used here along-
side an established neonatal ovary culture system in
which oocytes have already entered meiotic arrest prior
to culture [33, 34]. In vitro models are a growing area in
reproductive toxicology research, allowing pragmatic
and mechanistic studies of action of chemicals. The ro-
dent ovary is an excellent model for in vitro studies,
partly due to its small size, short time-course, high ma-
terial availability, and similarities in many key develop-
mental and functional aspects with the human ovary. A
second aim was to determine the expression pattern of
mammalian Topo IIα in the ovary, which has not yet
been reported: it has been examined here, in mouse and
human. The main goal of this work was to use ovarian
tissue culture methods to investigate the effect of etopo-
side on germ cells prior to and following follicle forma-
tion. Our results show that germ cells are particularly
sensitive to etoposide damage prior to follicle formation,
the only stage at which both Topo IIα and TopoIIβ are
expressed in the oocyte in the developing mouse and hu-
man ovary.
Results
Tissue culture supports physiological development of
fetal mouse ovaries
A culture technique to support development of fetal
mouse ovaries from E13.5 was developed, to allow ef-
fects of etoposide to be examined both before and after
follicle formation in a consistent manner, in vitro, with
neonatal mouse ovary culture already an established
method. Over the 12 days of culture, germ cells pro-
gressed through prophase I of meiosis, followed by for-
mation of PFs, with some follicles subsequently initiating
follicle growth to the transitional and primary follicle
stage (Fig. 2Ai,ii). Cultured follicles were morphologic-
ally healthy, similar to that observed in uncultured post-
natal day 4 (P4) in vivo ovaries (Fig. 2Aiii). Although
there was a significant reduction in follicle numbers
within cultured ovaries compared to in vivo P4 ovaries
(Fig. 2Bi; p < 0.01, n = 5, from 3 independent cultures),
health and follicle developmental stage were both com-
parable to that found in vivo (Fig. 2Bii,iii). Progression of
cultured oocytes through prophase I of meiosis to diplo-
tene was analysed through visualisation of Sycp3. Sycp3
is a component of the axial/lateral element of the syn-
aptonemal complex (SC) that assembles during meiotic
prophase I [35, 36]. In the female mouse embryo, germ
cells enter meiosis at E13.5 and progress through pro-
phase I to diplotene over the next 6–7 days [37]. Images
here show that meiosis progressed in vitro as in vivo: oo-
cytes progressed through leptotene/zygotene, pachytene,
and diplotene, as assessed by SC assembly and disassem-
bly (Fig. 3Ai-iii). In vitro oocytes were observed in all
stages of prophase I, with 57.1 % still leptotene/zygotene
and 42.3 % having reached pachytene by Day 2 of cul-
ture. By Day 4 of culture, the vast majority (99.2 %) had
reached pachytene, and by Day 6 of culture, the majority
(82.5 %) of oocytes had progressed through to the diplo-
tene stage of prophase I (Fig. 3B, upper panel): by Day 6
of culture, no leptene/zygotene oocytes remained, as
would be expected at the equivalent E19.5 point in vivo
[37]. Together, these results validate the use of this fetal
ovary culture system for investigations into meiotic pro-
gression and follicle formation.

 Germ cells are more vulnerable to etoposide exposure
prior to follicle formation
We first tested whether etoposide might be impairing
the ability of fetal oocytes to progress through meiotic
prophase. Fetal mouse ovaries were immunostained for
Sycp3 after culture in control medium, or in the pres-
ence of etoposide (150 ng ml−1) for 2, 4 or 6 days to as-
sess progression through early prophase I. There was a
difference between etoposide-treated and control oo-
cytes at Day 2 of culture (p < 0.01), but the effect was no
longer observed by Days 4 or 6 of culture (Fig. 3B; p =
0.4 at Days 4 and 6). The effect at Day 2 could be due to
an initial ‘acceleration’ in meiosis in germ cells exposed
to etoposide, or because the germ cells are more sensi-
tive to etoposide at mitotic and/or pre-leptotene stages:
increased sensitivity is perhaps more likely given the re-
duction in follicle number after etoposide exposure (see
results below). Overall, results show that female germ
cells are able to progress through meiosis to the diplo-
tene stage of prophase I in the presence of etoposide.
E13.5 fetal mouse ovaries were then cultured for
twelve days either in control medium throughout (Days
0–12), or exposed to a range of etoposide doses (50, 100
or 150 ng ml−1) for the first six days of culture (Days 0–
6), followed by a further six days in control medium
(Days 6–12): Day 7 of culture, when follicles have begun
to form in the cultured fetal mouse ovaries, was consid-
ered as equivalent to the day of birth in vivo. Etoposide
exposure occurred, therefore, prior to follicle formation,
spanning entry into meiotic prophase and progression
through to diplotene stage.
Over the twelve days of culture, oocytes entered meiotic
prophase and formed follicles, with some follicles then ini-
tiating growth to the primary stage. At the end of culture,
histological sections of cultured ovaries were examined
(Fig 4Ai-iii), follicles counted and assessed for health. Eto-
poside had a markedly detrimental effect on total follicle
numbers, with a dose-dependent loss of follicles of 72.5 %
and 89.7 % at the medium and high doses respectively
(Fig. 4Bi, p < 0.01 at 100 ng ml −1, p < 0.001 at 150 ng ml
−1; n = 6, 2 independent cultures). The observed follicle re-
duction was due to a loss in PF and transitional follicles
within these ovaries (Fig. 5Ai, p < 0.01; n = 6). The loss
was particularly marked for PFs, which constitute over
75 % of the follicles in control ovaries, with numbers re-
duced to 3.7 % of controls after exposure to 150 ng ml−1,
compared to 25 % of transitional follicles remaining. The
percentage of follicles assessed as unhealthy also increased
in a dose dependent manner with increasing etoposide
dose, reaching significance at the highest dose of etoposide
(Fig. 4Ci, p < 0.05; n = 6). Again, when each follicle stage
was examined, this was seen to be due to a significant

equivalently aged mice (P4) (Aiii). Despite a smaller number of follicles in cultured ovaries (Bi), very few follicles were unhealthy, with no difference
compared to the percentage of unhealthy follicles found in in vivo ovaries (Bii), and with follicles present at developmental stages in ratios comparable to
those present in P4 in vivo ovaries (Biii). Scale bars: 50 μm. Histogram bars denote mean ± SEM; n = 5 for all groups. Stars denote significant differences

 increase in the percentage of PF and transitional follicles
assessed as unhealthy (Fig. 5Bi, p < 0.05; n = 6). Ovaries
were then examined histologically at day 6 of culture, con-
sidered as equivalent to the last day of gestation, a time
point at which germ cells are beginning to form follicles
(Fig. 6Ai,ii). Ovaries cultured in the presence of the high-
est dose of etoposide (150 ng ml−1) had markedly and sig-
nificantly fewer germ cells than controls, indicating that
the reduced number of follicles observed at the end of
culture (Figs. 4Bi and 5Ai) was due to germ cell loss prior
to follicle formation (Fig. 6B, p < 0.0001, n = 5 for controls,
n = 6 for treatment group).
To investigate the effects of etoposide on folliculogen-
esis after germ cells are already enclosed in follicles, neo-
natal mouse ovaries were cultured for six days in control
medium or exposed to etoposide (50, 100, 150 or
200 ng ml−1) for the duration of culture. Over the six
days of culture, some PFs initiated growth to the transi-
tional or primary stage, with a few reaching the second-
ary
stage.
In
contrast
to
the
fetal
ovary
culture
experiments, when oocytes were exposed to etoposide
after follicle formation, no effect was seen on total fol-
licle number (Fig. 4Bii, p = 0.092; n = 6, 4 independent
cultures),

Fig. 3 Oocytes from cultured fetal ovaries progress through prophase I of meiosis in the presence or absence of etoposide. Fetal ovaries cultured
for 2, 4 or 6 days were stained for Sycp3 in order to assess the synaptonemal complex (SC). Oocytes were categorised into leptotene/zygotene,
(SC assembling but not fully formed) by the presence of extensive networks of fine Sycp3 threads, often with large nuclear aggregates of Sycp3
that has not yet assembled into SC (Ai); pachytene, (fully synapsed SC) by the presence of a thicker well-spaced long Sycp3 threads (Aii); or
diplotene, (SC disassembling but still present) by the presence of short thick fragments of Sycp3 threads (Aiii). B: Meiotic progression was
examined in germ cells from control ovaries and from ovaries exposed to 150 ng ml−1 etoposide during culture. Control oocytes progressed
through the early stages of prophase I in a normal manner during the first 6 days of culture, with the majority at leptotene/zygotene at Day 2 of culture,
pachytene at Day 4 and diplotene by Day 6 of culture, immediately prior to follicle formation. Oocytes exposed to 150 ng ml−1 etoposide during culture
were able to progress through to diplotene. At Day 2 of culture only, oocytes from etoposide-treated ovaries were at more advanced meiotic stages than
those from control ovaries, but there was no difference at Days 4 or 6. Scale bars: 10 μm, n = 961 control oocytes and n = 994 treatment oocytes. Stars

 (Fig. 4Cii, p = 0.082), despite exposing neonatal ovaries
to a higher concentration of etoposide (200 ng ml−1,
compared with the highest dose of 150 ng ml−1 for fetal
ovary cultures). When each follicle stage was examined
individually, the only effect seen was at the transitional
stage, which accounts for 15 % of follicles in control
ovaries. Here, etoposide significantly decreased transi-
tional follicle numbers at 100, 150 and 200 ng ml−1
doses (Fig. 5Aii, p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 respect-
ively; n = 6) with a corresponding increase in the per-
centage of transitional follicles assessed as unhealthy
only at the highest dose (Fig. 5Bii, p < 0.01; n = 6). There
was no significant effect on the number or health of PFs
(p = 0.101, p = 0.173 respectively) or primary follicles (p
= 0.604, p = 0.129 respectively).
Overall, results show a marked effect of etoposide on
follicle number only when ovaries are exposed prior to
follicle formation (fetal ovary culture), with significantly
fewer follicles remaining even when exposed to doses as
low as 100 ng ml−1. In contrast, exposure of ovaries to
etoposide only after follicle formation (neonatal ovary
culture), has no effect on overall follicle number or
health even up to the highest dose of 200 ng ml−1, with
the only significant effect found specifically on transi-
tional stage follicles.
Etoposide affects different follicular cell types depending
on the time of exposure

posed to etoposide only prior to follicle formation

 etoposide only after follicle formation (Fig 4Avi: yel-
low arrows). In order to examine this in more detail,
all histological sections were assessed further, with
each unhealthy follicle classified as having: (i) an un-
healthy oocyte only; (ii) unhealthy granulosa cells
only; or (iii) unhealthy oocyte and granulosa cells. Ex-
posure of fetal ovaries to etoposide resulted in a sig-
nificant increase in the proportion of follicles with
morphologically unhealthy oocytes (Fig. 7Ai, p < 0.05),
with no effect observed either on the proportion of
follicles with unhealthy granulosa cells only or un-
healthy oocyte and granulosa cells (Fig. 7Aii,iii, p =
0.429 and 0.470 respectively). In contrast, neonatal
cultured ovaries exposed to etoposide only after fol-
licle formation, exhibited a significant increase in the
proportion of follicles assessed as unhealthy due to
unhealthy granulosa cells, or where both the oocyte
and granulosa cells were unhealthy (Fig. 7Bii, Biii, p <
0.05; n = 6), with no significant effect on the propor-
tion of follicles assessed as unhealthy due to an un-
healthy oocyte (Fig. 7Bi, p = 0.069; n = 6).
Topo IIα is expressed in the female germ cell only prior
to follicle formation
Lastly, we sought to investigate why etoposide was hav-
ing more pronounced effects on oocyte rather than
granulosa health in fetal ovaries, but less predominantly
affecting the somatic granulosa cells rather than the oo-
cyte in neonatal ovaries. Etoposide functions by inhibit-
ing Topo II, preventing it from re-ligating the double-
stranded DNA breaks that Topo II introduces [22, 24,
25].
TopoIIβ
has
been
previously
reported
to
be
expressed in oocytes at all developmental stages, and is
also expressed in granulosa cells of PF and growing folli-
cles [29]. TopoIIα plays a more widespread role in re-
solving replication-induced topological structures than
TopoIIβ [revieved in Refs 24 and 28] and could also be
contributing to etoposide sensitivity in the developing
ovary. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess Topo
IIα expression within the developing mouse ovary, both
in vivo from E13.5 through to P6 and in vitro through-
out the course of the fetal ovary culture. It was also in-
vestigated in a second trimester fetal human ovary, a

 developmental stage at which the ovary contains female
germ cells both prior to and subsequent to follicle for-
mation. In the mouse, both in vivo and in vitro, Topo
IIα expression changed from a germ cell-only location
prior to follicle formation, to a somatic cell-only location
after follicle formation, primarily in granulosa but also
expressed in some stromal cells (Fig. 8a, b). Similarly, in
the developing human ovary, Topo IIα was expressed in
germ cells only prior to follicle formation, although here
Topo IIα was no longer expressed after follicle forma-
tion (Fig. 8c). The damaging effect of etoposide on ovar-
ian
germ
cells
(Figs.
4,
5
and
6)
is,
therefore,
pronounced only when etoposide exposure is coincident
with Topo IIα germ cell-specific expression. Thus the
developmental regulation of Topo IIα expression could
be one of the factors contributing to the more pro-
nounced effect of etoposide on fetal ovaries, when germ
cells express Topo IIα.
Discussion
The Topo II inhibitor etoposide has been administered
to women during pregnancy, with healthy babies born,
although there are no data on the side-effects of etopo-
side on the reproductive system of these children, as
none have yet reached puberty. Our results, using in
vitro systems to assess the effects of etoposide, show that
exposure of pre-follicular ovaries to etoposide results in
a near-complete elimination of healthy follicles by the
end of culture. This observed lack of follicles is a direct
result of etoposide-treated pre-follicular germ cells fail-
ing to survive, with only a small proportion capable of
forming follicles. Etoposide was used in concentrations
considerably lower than those measured in the serum of
patients, concentrations of 50–150 ng ml−1 being used,
compared with 5–60 μg ml−1 in patient serum [38]. In
contrast, exposure to oocytes once they were enclosed in
follicles had no effect on total follicle numbers or health,
the only effect seen on transitional follicles, and only
when
ovaries
were
exposed
to
a
higher
dose
of
200 ng ml−1. Thus once follicles have formed, the oo-
cytes are less susceptible to etoposide-induced damage.
One possible explanation for this change is that Topo
IIα was found to be expressed in female germ cells only
prior to follicle formation, in both mouse and human.
Despite the obvious differences between the mouse
ovary cultures described here and the real-life situation
of exposure to a human fetus, the results obtained do in-
dicate a cause for concern, especially since etoposide has
already been prescribed to pregnant women. Setting
aside inter-species differences, it is possible that since
etoposide targets mouse germ cells in our culture sys-
tem, that a similar effect might be observed in a human
fetal ovary exposed in vivo. This is especially true if eto-
poside inhibits Topo IIα in the human ovary, the

 expression pattern of which is the same in both the hu-
man and mouse ovary. Reassuringly, results here showed
little evidence of an effect of etoposide on the ability of
oocytes to progress through early prophase I of meiosis.
Etoposide-treated oocytes were able to reach the diplo-
tene stages of meiosis by the end of culture, although
there was an effect of etoposide treatment at Day 2 of
culture only, at which point a higher proportion of
etoposide-treated oocytes had progressed through lepto-
tene and zygotene to reach the pachytene stage, perhaps
indicating that the female germ cells are sensitive to eto-
poside at mitotic and/or pre-leptotene stages. However,
the ability of cultured oocytes in this study to progress
through early meiosis without delay does not rule out the
possibility that they may have developed DNA damage-
induced mutations or chromosomal re-arrangements fol-
lowing etoposide treatment. There may therefore be
underlying genetic or chromosomal abnormalities present
within these oocytes, which would only become evident
much later in oogenesis during meiotic chromosome seg-
regation, or even in a resulting embryo.
Etoposide has previously been shown to directly in-
hibit the action of Topo II [25–28, 39], and our results
here are consistent with this, in particular indicating that
the effect of etoposide is most noticeable in cells
expressing both Topo IIα and β. When etoposide was
administered prior to follicle formation, during the time-
frame that both Topo IIα and β are expressed in female
germ cells, follicle loss along with a rise in the number
of follicles with unhealthy oocytes was observed. In con-
trast, when etoposide was administered after follicle for-
mation, when Topo IIα is no longer expressed in germ
cells, although expression of Topo IIβ continues [29],
only subtle germ cell effects were found. Our finding
that the oocyte’s sensitivity to etoposide correlates with
developmental stages when both Topo IIα and β are
expressed, rather than expression of Topo IIβ alone, is
consistent with findings in proliferating cell types that
Topo IIα provides essential functions that cannot always
be efficiently complemented by Topo II β [reviewed in
28]. On the other hand, after follicle formation, when
Topo IIα and β are both expressed in granulosa cells,
there is a corresponding increase in the proportion of
follicles with unhealthy granulosa cells. The sensitivity of
fetal oocytes and post-natal granulosa cells to etoposide
presumably reflects Topo II activity in these cells, but
Fig. 7 Etoposide primarily targets oocytes prior to follicle formation and granulosa cells after follicle formation. Follicles were categorised as unhealthy due
to: unhealthy oocyte (OOC) only (i); unhealthy granulosa cells (GCs) only (ii); or unhealthy oocyte and granulosa cells (OOC + GCs) (iii), in fetal (a) or neonatal
(b) mouse ovaries exposed to etoposide. Bars denote mean ± SEM; n = 6 for all groups. Stars denote significant differences relative to control (*p < 0.05)

 further work will be required to determine whether the
effects of etoposide on oocytes and granulosa cells are
caused by DNA double strand breaks generated by
etoposide-mediated inhibition of Topo II [25, 26, 28], or
by defects in transcription, chromosome structure or
chromosome segregation which are all influenced by
Topo II activity [24].
In vitro organ and cell culture has become a widely
used tool within the field of reproductive toxicology,
providing a pragmatic and mechanistic method to study
the actions of reproductive toxicants. There are, how-
ever, limitations to this method, in that it is difficult to
account for any indirect action of a compound that can
modulate hormone-signalling pathways. Furthermore, in
vitro methods are unable to take into consideration me-
tabolism of the compound, with an effect observed in
vivo not necessarily being replicated in vitro. Despite
this, in vitro systems have become an invaluable prelim-
inary screening method to discover and investigate po-
tentially
harmful
compounds
on
the
reproductive
system. In vitro systems also have the added advantage
that they can reduce the number of animals required for
in vivo studies. Work here uses a novel fetal ovary cul-
ture system. The method supports female germ cell
entry into meiosis, nest breakdown, entry into meiotic
arrest, follicle formation and initiation of follicle growth,
and allows formation of healthy follicles in ratios com-
parable to that observed in the neonatal mouse ovary in
Fig. 8 Topo IIα is expressed in the germ cell only prior to follicle formation in the mouse and human ovary. a, b Topo IIα was localised within
the germ cells during pre-natal mouse ovary development (Ai,ii), and during the equivalent time in vitro, for the first 5 days of culture (Bi,ii). After
follicles formed, Topo IIα expression was no longer found within germ cells, instead localised to surrounding somatic cells, both in vivo (Aiii) and
in vitro (Biii). c Topo IIα expression was localised to germ cells not yet enclosed in follicles, in ovaries from week 19 human embryos (Ci, Cii). Cii:

 vivo. Relatively few previous culture systems have been
attempted that cover progression into prophase I of mei-
osis [40–46], and these have not supported subsequent
development to the physiological end point of ovarian
follicles without the use of invasive techniques [47]. As
such, although we have not developed this novel culture
system to support follicle growth beyond the primary
follicle stage, it could provide an important tool for in-
vestigations into early ovary development, including
toxicological studies.
Conclusions
Overall, our results show that early stage female germ
cells, prior to follicle formation, are particularly suscep-
tible to levels of etoposide that are low relative to patient
serum levels. This effect of etoposide was shown to coin-
cide with a change in Topo IIα expression, with Topo
IIα expressed only within female germ cells prior to fol-
licle formation, in the developing ovary of both mouse
and human. Our findings indicate the potential for ad-
verse effects on fetal ovarian development when etopo-
side is used as a chemotherapeutic agent in pregnant
mothers during the second or third trimesters, at which
point pre-follicular female germ cells are sensitive to the
detrimental effects of this compound: effects at this stage
of ovary development may well not become apparent
until many years later.
Methods
Animals
All experiments were approved by the University of
Edinburgh’s Local Ethical Review Committee and carried
out in accordance with UK Home Office regulations
under the ASPA 1986 act. Wild-type CD-1 mice were
maintained and bred in an environmentally-controlled
room on a 14-h light:10-h dark photoperiod. To obtain
fetuses for fetal ovary culture experiments, mouse breed-
ing harems were set up and females checked for the
presence of a copulation plug, then designated as E0.5.
Ovary culture
Fetal ovary culture
Pregnant timed-mated females were obtained at E13.5
and culled by cervical dislocation. Genital ridges con-
taining the developing fetal ovaries with mesonephros
attached were dissected from female embryos and placed
in 1x PBS at 4 °C (day of dissection: Day 0). Ovary-
mesonephros complexes were cultured for a total of
12 days on a 2 % agar block (Sigma Aldrich Ltd, Dorset
UK) in a 33 mm petri dish, incubated at 37 °C, 5 % CO2:
see Additional file 1 for further detail. During the first
three days of culture (Days 0–3), culture medium con-
tained Dulbecco’s Minimal Essential medium (Life Tech-
nologies, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf
serum (Thermo Fisher, Loughborough UK), 2 mM L-
glutamine (Invitrogen), 10 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Life
Technologies), 1 % sodium pyruvate (Sigma Aldrich),
1 % penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Paisley UK) and
1 % amphotericin B (Sigma Aldrich). For the subsequent
9 days of culture (Days 3–12), culture medium was re-
placed with a simpler culture medium composed of α-
MEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented solely with
3 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich).
Medium was topped up with approximately 200 μl of
fresh medium daily, and replaced totally with fresh
medium every 72 h.
The effect of etoposide on ovary development was
assessed by adding varying doses of etoposide (Sigma
Aldrich) to the medium for the first 6 days of culture
(Days 0–6). Etoposide was dissolved in DMSO (Sigma
Aldrich), therefore DMSO was also added to control
medium, with all media containing 0.1 % DMSO. Etopo-
side was added to produce final concentrations of 50,
100 or 150 ng ml−1 (highest concentration of etoposide
used was determined from preliminary experiments to
find the lowest dose that resulted in the death of the ma-
jority of follicles: data not shown). Ovaries were then
moved to drug-free culture medium for a further six
days (Days 6–12). At the end of culture (Day 12), ovaries
were fixed and processed for immunohistochemical or
histological analysis. All treatments were n = 6, based on
initial unpublished work examining ovary development
over the time-course of this culture method.
Neonatal ovary culture
P0 female mice were culled by decapitation and ovaries
dissected out into Leibovitz L-15 dissection medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 3 mg ml−1 bovine serum
albumin (Sigma Aldrich); day of dissection: Day 0. Ovar-
ies were cultured for 6 days in a 24-well culture plate
(Greiner
Bio-one,
Stonehouse
UK),
on
Whatman
nucleopore
polycarbonate
membranes
(Camlab
Ltd,
Cambridge UK, 13 mm, 8.0 μm) floating on α-MEM
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 3 mg ml−1 bo-
vine serum albumin, incubated at 37 °C, 5 % CO2. Cul-
ture medium was supplemented with varying doses of
etoposide to produce final concentrations of 50, 100,
150 or 200 ng ml−1 for the duration of the culture (Days
0–6). As with the fetal ovary cultures, etoposide was dis-
solved in DMSO, which was therefore also added to
control medium, all media containing 0.1 % DMSO. All
treatments were n = 6, with previously published work
showing this to be sufficient group size [34].
Histological follicle assessment
At the end of culture, ovaries were placed in 10 % buff-
ered
formalin

Aldrich)
for

 and stained with haemotoxylin and eosin. Every sixth
section was photomicrographed and follicle counts along
with assessment of follicle stage and health was carried
out, with the observer blind as to treatment. A follicle
was included in analysis only where the analysed section
contained an oocyte with a visible germinal vesicle. A
follicle was considered to be at the PF stage if it con-
tained only flattened pre-granulosa cells, at the transi-
tional stage if it contained both flattened and cuboidal
granulosa cells, or at the primary or secondary stage
where there was one or two complete layer(s) of cu-
boidal granulosa cells respectively. Follicle health was re-
corded
onto
a
separate
sheet,
with
follicles
only
considered healthy if there was a round oocyte contain-
ing a central nucleus and evenly stained cytoplasm, and
in the absence of pyknotic granulosa cells. Oocytes were
considered unhealthy if they contained a shrunken and
pyknotic nucleus or granulosa cells, identified by a dark
eosin stain. The Abercrombie correction factor was ap-
plied to raw counts to estimate total follicle number per
ovary [48].
Immunohistochemistry
Sycp3 immunohistochemistry: meiotic progression in mouse
oocytes
Progression through meiotic prophase I was monitored
by assessing SC assembly, using antibodies to Sycp3.
E13.5 ovaries were cultured in the presence or absence
of etoposide (150 ng ml−1) for 2, 4 or 6 days. Ovaries
were
fixed
in
10
%
buffered
formalin,
sectioned,
dewaxed, rehydrated and antigen retrieval carried out
(0.01 M citrate buffer, pH 6). Endogenous peroxidase ac-
tivity was blocked with 3 % hydrogen peroxide (H2O2;
Sigma Aldrich) in methanol for 30 mins. Slides were
washed (1x phosphate buffered saline [PBS], 0.1 % Tri-
ton X-100, Sigma Aldrich) and then incubated for 1 h
with 20 % normal goat serum (1x PBS, 5 % bovine serum
albumin [BSA]) to block non-specific binding. Sections
were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary mouse
anti-Sycp3 antibody (Abcam, 97672), diluted 1:200 in
20 % goat serum (1x PBS, 5 % BSA), washed (1x PBS,
0.1 % Triton X-100) and then incubated for 60 mins
with Alexa Fluor 568 secondary anti-mouse antibody
(Invitrogen, A21124) diluted 1:200. For visualisation,
slides were incubated in DAPI counterstain (Invitrogen,
D3571) diluted 1:10000 for 20 mins, washed, mounted
using Vectashield (Vector, H-1400) and coverslipped.
Photomicrographs (Leica A6000 fluorescent microscope)
were obtained for the largest cross section of each cul-
tured ovary. For analysis, counts were made of all oocyte
nuclei in leptotene, zygotene, pachytene or diplotene
stage of meiotic prophase, with an average of 160 oo-
cytes counted per ovary (n = 961 control oocytes, n = 994
etoposide oocytes).
Localisation of Topo IIα
CD1 mouse ovaries were collected each day from E13.5
embryos through to P6 pups, along with ovaries col-
lected from the fetal ovary culture (Days 1–12). Human
ovarian tissue was obtained following elective termin-
ation of pregnancy, with informed written consent and
approval from the SE Scotland Ethics Committee (refer-
ence number 06/S1102/4). Immunohistochemistry was
carried out as above with changes as detailed. Antibodies
used were: primary – rabbit anti-Topo II α antibody
(Abcam, ab52934), diluted 1:100; secondary - biotinyl-
ated
goat
anti
rabbit
antibody
(Dako
UK
Ltd,
Cambridgeshire, UK), diluted 1:200. For visualisation,
slides were incubated 30 mins using ABC kit (Vector
labs, Peterborough, UK), washed and incubated in Dako-
Cytomation
EnVision + DualLink
System,
Peroxidase
(DAB+) solution (Vector labs). Reaction was quenched
in H2O, slides washed, counterstained for 30 s in haema-
toxylin, dehydrated and mounted with DPX and glass
coverslips.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using Graphpad
prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
Proportions of germ cells in different stages of meiosis
were compared using chi squared analysis. For all other
studies involving more than one dose group, data were
analysed as follows. Data normality was assessed using
Kolmogorov Smirnoff tests. Where data were normally
distributed, one way ANOVA was used to detect statisti-
cally significant differences across treatments, followed
by Bonferroni post-hoc test where ANOVA showed stat-
istical significance. Where data were not normally dis-
tributed, Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used,
followed by Dunns post-hoc test where Kruskal-Wallis
showed statistical significance. Unpaired two-tailed t-
tests were used when analyses compared only two
groups. Raw data are provided in Additional file 2.
