Organophosphate-based pesticides inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which plays a pivotal role in neuromuscular
function. While spraying in the field, farmworkers get exposed to pesticides through the dermal route. Internalized
pesticide inhibits AChE, which leads to neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, cognitive dysfunction, loss of endurance, and
death in severe cases. Here, we present a nucleophilic pyridine-2-aldoxime–functionalized chitosan-based topical
gel (poly-Oxime gel) that rapidly deactivates organophosphates, methyl parathion (MPT), on the skin of rats, which
leads to reduced AChE inhibition in the blood and tissues. Testing the robustness of poly-Oxime gel, we report reduc-
tion in AChE inhibition following repeated dermal administration of MPT in the presence of poly-Oxime gel. Further-
more, poly-Oxime gel prevented MPT-induced neuromuscular dysfunction, loss of endurance, and locomotor
coordination. We observe a 100% survival in rats following topical MPT administration in the presence of poly-Oxime
gel. This prophylactic gel may therefore help farmworkers by limiting pesticide-induced toxicity and mortality.
INTRODUCTION
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is abundant in both central and peripheral
nervous system (1, 2). In addition to chemical warfare agents (CWAs),
organophosphate pesticides [such as methyl parathion (MPT), malathi-
on, paraoxon, and chlorpyrifos] are AChE inhibitors. Inhibition of
AChE leads to the accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine,
resulting in neurological disorders, suffocation, paralysis, and death in
severe cases (3, 4). India is one of the prime countries in pesticide usage
in the world, with a vast majority of agricultural workers being repeat-
edly exposed to pesticides in the field (5, 6). In addition to neurotoxic
effects, AChE inhibition leads to cardiotoxicity, reduced immunity, in-
fertility, and delayed sexual maturation (7). Cohort studies reveal that
pre- and postnatal exposures to pesticides impede neurodevelopment in
children living in agricultural communities and increase susceptibility
to neuropsychiatric disorders (8, 9).
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Recom-
mended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard, organophosphate pesti-
cides oxydemeton-methyl and methamedophos belong to class I
(extremely/highly hazardous); dimethoate, fenthion, quinalphos, chlor-
pyrifos, prothiofos, and diazinon belong to class II (moderately hazard-
ous); and malathion and pirimifos-methyl belong to class III (slightly
hazardous) (10, 11). It is clear that systemic exposure to pesticides
through the dermal route is a health hazard. Preventive strategies to
eliminate or minimize dermal exposure to reduce pesticide-induced
toxicity are a less attended clinical need. Although the personal protec-
tive equipment (PPE) such as suits, gloves, face masks, headgear, and
boots are available, they are scarcely used, mainly because of high cost
and discomfort under tropical conditions (12–14). The most effective
way to prevent pesticide exposure is chemical deactivation of pesticides,
andexisting PPElackthisability. Therehavebeen attempts to formulate
physical barrier creams in the past to attenuate exposure to pesticides or
CWAs (15–17). This design comes with an inherent limitation of expo-
sure, as the pesticide that is arrested on the surface can still enter the
system through the oral or ocular route via hand contact. In addition,
each pesticide brand has different additive formulations, and these for-
mulations have variable penetrance through physical barrier creams.
The noncatalytic nature of this approach also limits the amount of pes-
ticide the barrier creams can arrest. Therefore, physical barrier creams
are not effective in preventing exposure. The metal nanoparticles, like
CeO2, are studied as potential chemical deactivators of pesticides/
CWAs (18, 19). However, CeO2 nanoparticles are known to cause
DNA damage in dermal fibroblasts, an effect that necessarily limits their
use in dermal protectants (20, 21).
To understand the awareness of agricultural workers about the
pesticide-induced toxicity, we interacted with several farmers and
their families in the field. All of them were aware of pesticide-induced
toxicity, as they experience pain right after they spray pesticides in the
field. However, because of the lack of any protective technologies, they
suffer, and they expressed their willingness to adopt any topical tech-
nologies that can prevent pesticide exposure. Because of the low pur-
chasing power of this sector, the affordable cost would be a key
differentiating factor to have compliance to adopt these technologies
by the end user—the farmer. This unmet need inspired us to develop
prophylactic technologies to prevent pesticide exposure during spray-
ing in the field. An ideal user-compliant solution would be a low-cost,
easy-to-use, nonobstructive biocompatible material, which could in-
activate pesticides on the skin and prevent their penetration. A topical
gel with catalytic activityto cleave/hydrolyze pesticides before entering
into the skin may serve as a prophylactic strategy to reduce chronic
exposure (Fig. 1A). The aim/objective of this study was to determine
whether a nucleophilic pyridine-2-aldoxime–functionalized chitosan-
based topical gel (poly-Oxime gel) could be used as a prophylactic gel
to deactivate pesticides on the skin before they enter the body. How-
ever, multiple technical hurdles exist in designing this catalytically
robust prophylactic topical gel. The first is the identification of a reac-
tive nucleophile that can act by rapidly hydrolyzing organophosphate
ester on the skin before it enters. Also, it should catalytically, not stoi-
chiometrically, cleave organophosphates. Second, the topical gel
should be chemically active in different climate conditions to be effec-
tive in tropical and cold countries.

 Fig. 1. Nucleophilic poly-Oxime gel to deactivate pesticides to limit toxicity. (A) Dermal penetration of pesticide (MPT) leads to the inhibition of AChE, which plays a
pivotal role in biological functions including neuronal signaling and neuromuscular coordination (NMC). MPT-mediated inhibition of AChE leads to severe toxicity
including neuromuscular dysfunction, loss of endurance, and locomotor function. In our approach, the presence of a-nucleophile (an oxime) attached polymer
(poly-Oxime) formulated as a topical gel could deactivate organophosphorus ester, MPT, through hydrolysis. This limits MPT penetration into the skin, which leads
to the reduction of pesticide-induced toxicity. (B) Synthesis of poly-Oxime using pyridine-2-aldoxime connected to chitosan through acetamide linker. With humectants

 Here, we present a nucleophilic topical gel (poly-Oxime) that is
capable of catalytically deactivating organophosphates efficiently on
the skin, thereby reducing inhibition of AChE quantitatively and
limiting pesticide-induced toxicity and mortality. The N-hydroxy
a-nucleophile–containing poly-Oxime was converted into a gel by ad-
dition of excipients like carbopol 940, glycerin, and propylene glycol
(Fig. 1B). This a-nucleophile–based topical gel solves the aforemen-
tioned challenges. A direct dermal exposure of a widely used pesticide,
MPT, in rats significantly inhibited the activity of AChE in blood,
brain, lung, liver, and heart. A single-dose dermal exposure of MPT
(150 mg/kg) in rats dampened the locomotor coordination function,
altered neuromuscular signaling, and led to death with a median sur-
vival time of 4 days. The same dose of MPT in the presence of poly-
Oxime topical gel did not induce any adverse effects, and a 100%
survival was observed.
RESULTS
Synthesis of poly-Oxime gel and deactivation of pesticides
in vitro and ex vivo
Most pesticides are organophosphate esters. Thus, a nucleophile-
mediated ester hydrolysis is an efficient way to deactivate pesticides.
a-Nucleophiles are known as efficient groups for hydrolytic cleavage
of organophosphates (22–24). Oxime (N-hydroxy compound) is a
potent a-effect O-nucleophile (25, 26). Therefore, we reasoned that
pyridine-2-aldoxime would be a powerful a-nucleophile, which can be
functionalized on a biopolymer, chitosan (Fig. 1B). Chitosan, a bio-
compatible polymer, has been extensively used to develop a wide
range of biomaterials (27, 28). Conjugation of pyridine-2-aldoxime
to chitosan through an acetamide linker in solution phase generated
poly-Oxime (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Methods). The degree of
functionalization was 40%. A detailed characterization of poly-Oxime
is given in the Supplementary Materials. The kinetics of MPT hydrol-
ysis was obtained by monitoring the appearance of p-nitrophenoxide
spectrophotometrically at 400 nm (Fig. 1A and see Materials and
Methods). The soluble poly-Oxime polymer was used to study the cat-
alytic activity toward decontamination of different pesticides. The ob-
served pseudo–first-order (kobs) values for the cleavage of MPT,
paraoxon, and chlorpyrifos were 4.59 × 10−4, 2.28 × 10−4, and 5.55 ×
10−4 s−1, respectively. Data in table S1 show that poly-Oxime is an ef-
fective catalyst for the hydrolytical deactivation of multiple organophos-
phates, in that they afford more than two orders of magnitude rate
enhancement over the background reaction. Poly-Oxime also showed
activity at different temperatures (at 20°C, kobs = 3.37 × 10−4 s−1; at 30°C,
kobs = 7.18 × 10−4 s−1; at 40°C, kobs = 17.57 × 10−4 s−1).
To evaluate the ability of poly-Oxime gel to prevent pesticide pene-
tration into the skin, we formulated the poly-Oxime (2%, w/w) into a
topicalgel using the following additives: glycerin (6.8%, w/w), propylene
glycol (3.74%, w/w), and carbopol 940 (1.8%, w/w; see Materials and
Methods). Sham gel, as a control, was prepared using the same
composition, with unmodified chitosan replacing the poly-Oxime. Both
gels have shown standard gel-like behavior in rheology studies (fig. S1)
and could be applied to the skin. A temperature-dependent rheology
studies at 25°, 35°, and 45°C with poly-Oxime gel revealed that at higher
temperatures, it maintains its gel-like behavior but becomes softer as
seen in the reduction in G′ values (fig. S1, C to E). The fact that, in linear
viscoelastic range, all the gels showed G′ > G″ suggests that they behave
like viscoelastic solids or gels. Carbopol 940 is a hydrophilic colloidal
gum that offers a high thickening gel property due to water absorption,
leading to the formation of macroscopic swollen particles. This forma-
tion is attributed to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic groups of the
polymer and water molecules. The observed softening of gel upon ad-
dition of the poly-Oxime polymer could be explained because of charges
in quaternary N and deprotonated oxime groups that promote
electrostatic interaction with solvent, rather than hydrogen bonding.
This might result in reduced solvent interaction in terms of hydrogen
bonding and thus formation of softer gels. Franz diffusion apparatus
was used to mimic the transdermal penetration (Fig. 2A). The uncoated
dialysis membrane [molecular weight cutoff (MWCO), 3.5 kDa] or the
membrane coated with a thin layer of sham gel or poly-Oxime gel was
placed between donor and acceptor chambers. Subsequently, MPT was
added into the donor chamber and the acceptor chamber was filled with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The chamber’s temperature was
maintained at 37°C. At different time points (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5 hours), the concentration of MPT and its hydrolytically degraded
product p-nitrophenol (pNP) was quantified in both donor and accep-
tor chambers using ultrafast liquid chromatography (UFLC; Fig. 2, B to
E). In the presence of the uncoated membrane or sham gel–coated
membrane, MPT was quantitatively penetrated into the acceptor cham-
ber within 3hours, whereas poly-Oxime gelpreventedMPT penetration
(Fig. 2, B and C). It suggests that sham gel does not act as a physical
barrier and MPT can easily pass through the gel. Data in Fig. 2
(D and E) show that poly-Oxime gel was able to degrade MPT into
pNP, which was quantified in both donor and acceptor chambers. After
3 hours, the deactivation was nearly complete and the pNP that
formed in the donor compartment started to diffuse into the acceptor
compartment. pNP was not generated in any of those chambers in the
absence of poly-Oxime gel. These results suggest that poly-Oxime gel
prevents the penetration of MPT, not as a physical barrier but through
chemically hydrolyzing MPT.
Organophosphates are known to inhibit AChE in blood (29). An
ex vivo assay was carried out using rat blood in Franz diffusion cell to
evaluate the ability of poly-Oxime gel to limit MPT-induced AChE
inhibition (Fig. 2F). Akin to the previous experiment, three groups
were taken (uncoated, sham gel, and poly-Oxime gel–coated mem-
branes between both chambers) along with the no MPT group,
1000× diluted rat blood was taken in the acceptor chamber, and the
percentage of the AChE activity was quantified using modified color-
imetric Ellman’s assay (see Materials and Methods) (30). In the ab-
sence of MPT, no change was observed in the activity of AChE after
3 hours (Fig. 2G). The addition of MPT (1 mM) in the donor chamber
led to a significant inhibition of AChE activity in blood. The presence of
native membrane or sham gel–coated membrane did not limit MPT-
mediated AChE inhibition (Fig. 2G). On the contrary, poly-Oxime gel
deactivated MPT before entering into the acceptor chamber, thereby
completely reducing MPT-induced inhibition of blood AChE activity.
Poly-Oxime gel could hydrolytically cleave a wide range of commercial
organophosphate formulations (fig. S2). Under similar reaction
conditions, sham gel, which was made with native chitosan without ox-
ime groups, did not deactivate pesticides, suggesting that poly-Oxime
a-nucleophile isessentialforthereactivity(fig.S2).These results suggest
that poly-Oxime gel could limit pesticide-induced AChE inhibition by
chemically deactivating organophosphates.
To validate the role of the oxime group in imparting the ability to
limit pesticide exposure, we blocked the active oxime group with methyl
ether. O-methoxy pyridine-2-aldoxime (methoxyOxime) was covalent-
ly attached to chitosan (poly-methoxyOxime) using the same process
that was used for the poly-Oxime polymer (a detailed synthesis protocol

 and characterization is given in Supplementary Methods). Akin to
poly-Oxime gel, the poly-methoxyOxime gel was prepared and its abil-
ity to reduce MPT-induced AChE inhibition in the blood was evaluated
using Franz diffusion cell ex vivo. While poly-Oxime gel completely de-
creased the MPT-induced AChE inhibition, blocking of oxime nucleo-
phile with methoxy ether (poly-methoxyOxime gel) led to the loss of its
activity (fig. S3). The inability of poly-methoxyOxime gel to prevent
AChE inhibition validates the importance of oxime nucleophile to de-
activate MPT.
Poly-Oxime gel prevents pesticide-induced AChE inhibition
in blood and tissue in vivo
To evaluate the ability of poly-Oxime gel to prevent MPT-induced
AChE inhibition, 18 Sprague-Dawley rats (10 to 13 weeks) were ran-
domly divided into three groups (n = 6 per group). The dorsal coat
was clipped, and the 10-cm2 area was exposed to MPT directly or in
the presence of the sham gel or poly-Oxime gel layer (see Materials
and Methods). According to the WHO, pesticides that have LD50
(median lethal dose) of 10 to 100 mg/kg of body weights in rats (dermal
exposure) are considered as “highly hazardous” (class Ib) (10, 11). To
test the robustness of poly-Oxime gel, we dermally exposed all groups to
MPT (150 mg/kg) (Fig. 3A). Quantification of active AChE in the blood
at pre-exposure (0 hours) and post-exposure (96 hours) revealed that
dermal exposure of MPT alone or in the presence of sham gel signifi-
cantly decreased the active AChE, whereas in the presence of poly-
Oxime gel no such decrease was seen (Fig. 3B). Animals that were
exposed to MPT alone or in the presence of sham gel lost ~20% of their
initial body weight by day 4, while animals that were exposed to MPT in
the presence of poly-Oxime gel did not lose their weight and showed
normalweight gain(fig.S4).Inaddition,on day4,animalsweresacrificed,
and tissues like brain, heart, liver, and lung were isolated and quantified
for active AChE in comparison with the naïve rat tissues. Data in Fig. 3
(C to F) suggest that the MPT exposure leads to a decrease in active
AChE levels, while sham gel could not protect from the MPT exposure.
On the contrary, the presence of poly-Oxime gellimited the reduction of
active AChE. These results demonstrate that poly-Oxime gel does not act
likeatypicalbarriergel,butithydrolyticallydeactivatesorganophosphate,
leading to limiting AChE inhibition.
Poly-Oxime gel prevents pesticide-induced mortality in vivo
As multiple exposures of MPT could cause mortality, we investigated
the ability of poly-Oxime gel to prevent MPT-induced mortality in rats.

was applied on a dialysismembrane, which was placed between donor and acceptor chambers. (B to E) Concentration of MPT and pNP(hydrolytic degradation product of MPT) in
donor and acceptor chambers was measured using UFLC. The presence of sham gel did not prevent the diffusion of MPT into the acceptor chamber and could not hydrolyze MPT
to generate pNP, whereas poly-Oxime actively hydrolyzed to limit the penetration of toxic MPT into the acceptor chamber. (F and G) An ex vivo assay to demonstrate the ability of
poly-Oxime to limit MPT-induced assay AChE inhibition using rat blood. AChE containing rat blood was placed in the acceptor chamber, and MPT was added in the donor chamber

into an acceptor chamber and significantly inhibited AChE activity. However, poly-Oxime gel could hydrolyze MPT before diffusion, therefore limiting the MPT-induced inhibition
of AChE. Data are means ± SD (n = 3, performed at least twice); P values were determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). ****P < 0.0001. ns, not significant.

 A single dose of 150 mg/kg leads to 100% mortality in a direct exposure
group with a mean survival time (MST) of 4 days. Therefore, for sur-
vival experiments, the dose was brought down to 100 mg/kg to under-
stand response to multiple exposures and thus partly mimic the field
scenario of multiple exposures. First, 18 Sprague-Dawley rats were
randomized into three groups (n = 6), and all groups received MPT
(100 mg/kg per day) once a day until >50% mortality was observed in
one of the groups. Group 1 animals received MPT without any gel, sham
gel was applied daily on group 2 animals, and poly-Oxime gel was applied
daily on group 3 animals, 30 min before the MPT exposure (Fig. 4A).
Animals in groups 1 and 2 showed the characteristics of organo-
phosphate pesticide poisoning in the rats (31); symptoms include sali-
vation, muscular fibrillation, diarrhea, lacrimation, respiratory distress,
gasping, decreased body temperature, and tremors. On the contrary,
group 3 animals that received MPT after the application of prophylactic
poly-Oxime gel did not show any signs of toxicity. All animals directly
exposed to the MPT group died in 5 days, while all the animals in the
sham gel group died within 7 days, with an MST of 4 and 6 days, re-
spectively, and all animals that received MPT after the poly-Oxime gel
application survived (Fig. 4B). A 100% survival rate was observed in the
presence of poly-Oxime gel (n = 6; P = 0.0001, Mantel-Cox test). The
blood was collected before exposing to MPT (day 0) and at the terminal
stage (on day 3 for groups 1 and 2 and on day 30 for group 3). Animals
in group 3 were tested for any delayed signs of toxicity for 30 days, and
the study was terminated on day 30. No visible delayed signs of toxicity
like muscular fibrillation, diarrhea, lacrimation, and respiratory distress
were observed. Quantification of active AChE in the blood revealed that
direct exposure of MPT and the sham gel group showed a decrease in
active AChE, while poly-Oxime gel limited the inhibition of AChE ac-
tivity (Fig. 4C). In addition, brain tissue was collected from group 1 and
2 animals immediately after they died. Because not even a single animal
died in group 3, they were sacrificed on day 30 and their brain tissue was
harvested. The active AChE in tissues was quantified. Exposure of MPT
either directly or in the presence of sham gel significantly decreased the
active AChE, while poly-Oxime gel prevented reduction of active AChE
in the brain (fig. S5A). In addition, while animals in groups 1 and 2 that

of MPT (150 mg/kg) was applied on the skin either directly or in the presence of the sham gel (220 mg per animal) or poly-Oxime gel (220 mg per animal) layer. (B) Active AChE in
the blood was quantified using Ellman’s assay. Direct exposure of MPT significantly reduced the active AChE in the blood. Sham gel could not limit MPT-induced AChE inhibition,
while poly-Oxime gel deactivated MPT before entering into the skin, therefore reducing the MPT-induced AChE inhibition. (C to F) On day 5, rats were sacrificed, tissue was
collected, and the amount of active AChE was quantified. Dermal exposure of MPT either directly on the skin or in the presence of sham gel led to the decrease in the active AChE
in all tissues such as brain, heart, liver, and lung, while poly-Oxime gel significantly reduced this MPT-mediated deactivation of AChE. Data in (B) to (F) are means ± SD (n = 6 rats per
group); P values were determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001.

 received MPT lost their body weight, group 3 animals that were exposed
to MPT in the presence of poly-Oxime gel continue to gain weight nor-
mally until the end of the study (fig. S5B).
An oxime could hydrolyze multiple organophosphate molecules in a
truly catalytic manner. After cleaving one molecule of organophos-
phate, an oxime nucleophile could regenerate and cleave more organo-
phosphate molecules (Fig. 1A). To test the robust nature of poly-Oxime
gel in vivo, we randomized 12 Sprague-Dawley rats into two groups
(n = 6). On day 0, we applied 220 mg of sham gel or poly-Oxime gel on
group 1 and 2 animals, respectively. In one-time post-application of the
gel, both groups received MPT (100 mg/kg per day) for 4 days (Fig. 4D).
All the animals in the sham gel group died within 7 days with an
MST of 5 days, whereas a 100% survival was observed in one-time
poly-Oxime gel–treated group (n = 6; P = 0.0006, Mantel-Cox test;
Fig. 4E). Analysis of active AChE in the blood revealed that sham gel
could not reduce MPT-mediated inhibition of AChE in the blood and
Fig. 4. Either daily or a single application of poly-Oxime gel prevented mortality during repeated exposure of MPT in vivo. (A) Sprague-Dawley rats (10 weeks,
males) were randomized in three groups (n = 6 rats per group): (i) direct exposure of MPT, (ii) sham gel + MPT, and (iii) poly-Oxime gel + MPT. Either sham gel or poly-
Oxime gel (220 mg per rat per day) was applied every day before the MPT exposure (100 mg/kg per day for 4 days). Organs were collected either immediately after
mortality or on day 30. AChE activity in blood and organs was quantified using modified Ellman’s assay. (B) MST for direct exposure of MPT and MPT received in the
presence of sham gel was 4 and 6 days, respectively, while poly-Oxime gel–applied group did not show mortality. (C) Blood AChE activity dropped markedly in direct
MPT and sham gel groups, while inhibition was reduced in poly-Oxime gel–applied animals. (D) Rats were divided into two groups (n = 6 rats per group). On day 0, 220 mg of
sham gel and poly-Oxime gel was applied dermally on group 1 and 2 animals, respectively. Without further applying any gel, MPT (100 mg/kg per day) was given daily
for 4 days. Organs were collected either immediately after mortality or on day 21. (E) MST for sham gel was 5 days, while poly-Oxime gel–applied group did not show

 brain tissue compared to the presence of prophylactic poly-Oxime gel
(Fig. 4F and fig. S6A). In addition, animals in the poly-Oxime gel group
did not lose their body weight compared to the sham gel group (fig.
S6B). When poly-Oxime gel was applied before the MPT exposure, in
addition to providing 100% survival, there were no visible signs such
as shivering and stress-induced porphyrin discharge, which are hall-
marks of pesticide-induced toxicity and stress. Cumulatively, these
results suggest that poly-Oxime gel can deactivate organophosphate
pesticides in a robust manner to prevent pesticide-induced toxicity
and mortality. We propose that this property of poly-Oxime gel could
be protective for farmers and workers who are exposed to high doses
of pesticides repeatedly.
Poly-Oxime gel prevents pesticide-induced loss of motor
coordination and altered neuromuscular signaling
Organophosphate pesticides bind and subsequently inhibit the AChE in
synaptic clefts of the neuromuscular junction (32–34). Lethal effects are
cardiovascular collapse and respiratory failure. Signaling at motor end
plate gets impaired because of AChE inhibition. Therefore, pesticide ex-
posure leads to the reduction in motor coordination and altered neuro-
muscular signaling (35–37). Pesticide-induced stress reduces the
endurance (38, 39). The endurance and motor coordination of rats ex-
posed to MPT with and without poly-Oxime gel were tested using the
rotarod experiment. Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 4
in each group) were trained on a rotarod for 4 days (Fig. 5A), and while
training, animals in all the groups showed similar latency to fall (Lf; time
to fall from rotating rod with 2 to 20 rpm). Lf on day 4 was considered as
100%. After recording Lf on day 4, group 1 animals were left unexposed,
group 2 animals were directly exposed to MPT, and group 3 animals
received MPT in the presence of poly-Oxime gel. After the MPT expo-
sure, group 2 animals showed a significant drop in the latency to fall,
thus indicating an MPT-induced reduction in endurance (Fig. 5B). On
the contrary, group 3 animals that received MPT in the presence of pro-
phylactic poly-Oxime gel did not show a reduction in latency to fall and
continued improvement in the performance like unexposed group 1,
which suggests that poly-Oxime gel prevents the pesticide-induced re-
duction in endurance. We used acceleration in rotation speed from 2 to
60 rpm, with a step size of 4 rpm to study the neuromuscular coordi-
nation (NMC) of rats under constant need to readjust the muscle re-
cruitment. After training for 6 days, animals were similarly divided
into three groups (n = 5 per group) and tested for NMC. Animals in
group 2 showed a significant drop in NMC, while poly-Oxime gel could
prevent this drop of NMC and showed performance similar to that of
unexposed animals (Fig. 5C).
Gait analysis is a conventionally used noninvasive method to study
sciatic nerve injury and recovery. The pattern of walking is decided by
the posture of the foot, angle formed with the ground, and the force
exerted. These things combined will establish a particular print length,
toe spread, and intertoe spread of an animal, and it gets affected if there
is any impairment of nerve function (Fig. 5D) (40, 41). When analyzed
for sciatic functional index (SFI), which is an empirically derived
formula to evaluate nerve function (see Materials and Methods), the direct
exposure group showed values decreasing to −30 to −60, which indicates
partial impairment of sciatic nerve function. However, the poly-Oxime
gel–protected animals showed no significant reduction in SFI, suggest-
ing complete prevention of nerve function impairment (Fig. 5E).
Visible muscular spasms were observed in the animals directly ex-
posed to MPT. We recorded electromyogram (EMG) for biceps femoris
of the left hind limb under 2.5% isoflurane anesthesia and between
spinotrapezius and gluteus maximus when the animal was awake. In
either case, EMG showed frequent muscle activity. This involuntary
muscle activity was completely absent in the animals protected with
poly-Oxime gel before the application of MPT (Fig. 5, F and G).
DISCUSSION
Increasing resistance in pest is forcing agriculture farmers to use a
cocktail of potent organophosphates in the field. However, the lack of
any protective measure during spraying in the field is causing a direct
exposure to pesticides. High dermal penetration of pesticides leads to
acute toxicity, including neural dysfunction, muscle dysfunction, and
respiratory arrest. Currently, adverse toxic effects of pesticides are a
major concern for farmworkers. Although the use of PPE could be
an alternative route, the lack of compliance due to uncomforted use in
developing countries is a major hurdle. In developing countries, the
manual spray of pesticides is still the primary practice, as compared
to developed countries where the machine spray or aerial spray is be-
ing practiced. A manual spray of pesticides leads to direct dermal ex-
posure. Human studies reveal that pre- and postnatal exposure to
pesticides delays neuronal development in children who are living
in agricultural communities. In addition, it increases susceptibility
to neuropsychiatric disorders (8, 9). Therefore, a few attempts were
made to develop physical barrier creams (15, 16). Because of the high
skin penetration of pesticides, commercial physical barrier creams
were not sufficient to prevent pesticide entry into the body (fig. S7).
This prompted us to devise a new strategy, which is a chemical de-
activation of pesticides on the skin to prevent their entry into the body.
We have designed a polymeric super-nucleophile (a-nucleophile)–
mediated hydrolysis of pesticides on the skin.
Poly-Oxime could be formulated into the dermal gel using excipi-
ents. Our data suggest that a thin layer of poly-Oxime gel can hydrolyze
organophosphates on the skin; therefore, it can prevent AChE inhibi-
tion quantitatively in blood and in all internal organs such as brain,
lung, liver, and heart. Previously, there were no examples that demon-
strated prevention of AChE inhibition in vivo. Our data demonstrate
that poly-Oxime gel does not act as a physical barrier. Instead, it hydro-
lyzes organophosphate ester, MPT, into nonharmful hydrolytic
products such as dimethyl phosphate and pNP, which cannot inhibit
AChE. Poly-Oxime gel can hydrolytically cleave a wide range of pesti-
cides, including commercial organophosphate formulations such as
chlorpyriphos, prophenophos, and monocrotophos, and therefore
can prevent pesticide-induced AChE inhibition. The activity of poly-
Oxime gel against a broader range of pesticides shows its robustness.
As farmers spray pesticides in all seasons including cold winters and
hot summers, the prophylactic gel should be active at a wide range of
temperature. The fact that the poly-Oxime showed an efficient catalytic
activity at temperatures ranging from 20° to 40°C and retained its ac-
tivity even after prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light shows sta-
bility and ability to function in varying weather conditions (fig. S8).
Farming in developing countries is labor-intensive and demands
strenuous physical activity from agriculture workers. As pesticide expo-
sure is known to affect endurance and NMC, farmers lose their ability to
work with full capacity. In rat models, we recapitulated the loss of en-
durance and NMC due to pesticide exposure. Our data demonstrate
that the presence of poly-Oxime gel completely prevented pesticide-
induced loss of endurance and NMC. In addition, pesticide exposure
can severely damage nerves such as the sciatic nerve. Using Gait anal-
ysis, we demonstrated that direct exposure to pesticide significantly

 damaged the sciatic nerve, while the presence of poly-Oxime gel pre-
vented this damage.
Todemonstrate the efficiencyof poly-Oxime geltopreventpesticide-
induced mortality, we used two sets of experiments. In the first set,
rats were repeatedly exposed to a pesticide, while every day a thin
layer of poly-Oxime gel was applied before pesticide exposure. While
rats died in the absence of poly-Oxime gel (MST, 4 days), the presence
of poly-Oxime gel prevented mortality and a 100% survival was ob-
served. In the second set, poly-Oxime gel was applied only once on
day 0 and repeatedly exposed to pesticide for 4 days. Even a single
application of poly-Oxime gel completely prevented mortality with a
100% survival. A daily or single application of sham gel led to 100%
mortality with an MST of 7 and 6 days, respectively. This demonstrates
the stability, robustness, and true catalytic nature of poly-Oxime gel.

endurance and NMC in MPT animals either directly or in the presence of poly-Oxime gel. (B) Latency to fall was measured by measuring the time the animal stayed on
rotarod at a constant speed of 20 rpm, and it was normalized to the day of exposure. Directly exposed MPT animals showed significant reduction endurance that was
prevented by poly-Oxime cream. (C) When animals were subjected to increasing speed from 2 to 60 rpm, the rpm reached before falling was taken as a measurement
to assign NMC score, and data were normalized to the day of exposure. Poly-Oxime cream showed complete rescue of loss of NMC, which was observed with direct
exposure MPT animals. (D and E) Paw prints of animals were exposed either directly or in the presence of poly-Oxime gel before and after exposure. Prints were used to

 In conclusion, we have developed a prophylactic topical gel (poly-
Oxime) that can limit pesticide-induced systemic AChE inhibition
and therefore can prevent loss of motor coordination, loss of endurance,
altered neuromuscular function, and mortality. Thus, in addition to
bringing awareness to agriculture workers, this technology may offer
a great promise for farmers and workers who use pesticides. The ability
of poly-Oxime gel to deactivate organophosphate in a catalytic manner
also has a potential to be used for protection against organophosphate-
based CWAs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The goal of this study was to design a nucleophilic topical gel to chem-
ically deactivate pesticides on the skin to prevent pesticide-induced
neuronal dysfunction and mortality. We hypothesized that nucleophile-
mediated hydrolysis of pesticides into nonharmful products could pre-
vent systemic AChE inhibition.
In vitro
We initially examined the hydrolytic cleavage of pesticides using a nu-
cleophilic topical gel, thereby preventing inhibition of AChE using
Franz diffusion cells.
In vivo
A series of experiments were designed to recapitulate pesticide-induced
systemic AChE inhibition, loss of endurance, loss of NMC, sciatic nerve
damage, and lethality in rats upon dermal exposure of pesticide, MPT.
We tested the hypothesis of the presence of nucleophilic poly-Oxime gel
that can deactivate pesticides on the skin and prevent pesticide-induced
toxicity and mortality.
Rats
For all experiments, 10- to 14-week-old Sprague-Dawley albino rats
were used for experiments. Animals were provided by the animal house
at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru. Animals were
caged (maximum, fourpercage) before the experiment and individually
after starting the experiment. Food and water were offered ad libitum.
All rat studies were performed according to institutional and national
guidelines for humane animal use. Experimental protocols were ap-
proved by the Institute Animal Ethical Committee at the Institute for
Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine (INS-IAE-2016/09).
Materials
Pyridine-2-aldoxime, bromoacetic acid, chitosan (medium molecu-
lar weight), dimethyl formamide, potassium carbonate, O-(benzotriazol-
1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU),
parathion methyl (PESTANAL), methyl paraoxon (PESTANAL), chlor-
pyrifos (PESTANAL), carbopol 940, glycerin, propylene glycol, tri-
ethanolamine (TEA; S. D. Fine-Chem Limited, Bangalore), snake skin
dialysis membrane (MWCO, 3.5 kDa; Thermo Fisher Scientific), tri-
fluoroacetic acid, pNP (Alfa Aesar), isoflurane (Isotroy), Triton X-
100, EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB), acetylthiocholine iodide (ASChI), and deionized water
were used. Unless mentioned otherwise, all chemicals were procured
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Synthesis of poly-Oxime and poly-methoxyOxime
A detailed stepwise synthesis procedure and a detailed characterization
of intermediate compounds and final polymers are described in Supple-
mentary Methods.
Catalytic efficiency of poly-Oxime
A solution of poly-Oxime (2 mg/ml) in 1% acetic acid was used to study
its catalytic ability to cleave pesticides. The reactions were studied spec-
trophotometrically by monitoring the hydrolysis of pesticides (MPT,
methyl paraoxon, or chlorpyrifos) at 25 ± 0.1°C and pH 8.2 by
measuring the absorbance at 400 nm as a function of time. Pseudo–
first-order rate constants were obtained by using an excess of nucleo-
phile (2.5 × 10−4 M) over the substrate (2.5 × 10−5 M). For all the
kinetic runs, the absorbance/time result fits very well to the first-order
rate equation. To study temperature stability, the same reactions were
carried out at 20°, 30°, and 40°C.
Preparation of poly-Oxime gel
The dermal gel was formulated by using carbopol 940 (1.8%), glycerin
(6.81%), propylene glycol (3.74%), and poly-Oxime polymer (2%)
mixed in water (85.6%). The pH of the gel was maintained at 8 by
TEA. For sham gel, the unfunctionalized chitosan polymer, instead of
the poly-Oxime polymer, was used, serving as a control gel with all in-
gredients but no catalytic activity.
In vitro and ex vivo efficacy of poly-Oxime dermal gel to
reduce permeation of pesticide
The dialysis membrane (MWCO, 3.5 kDa) was hydrated overnight in
the deionized water at room temperature. It was then placed between
the donor and acceptor compartments of the Franz diffusion cells (DBK
Diffusion apparatus) and clamped to avoid any leakage. The acceptor
compartment was filled with PBS (pH 7.4), making uniform contact
with a dialysis membrane. The experiment was performed in three
groups (only membrane, sham gel, and poly-Oxime gel) comprising
three diffusion cells in each set. Poly-Oxime or sham gel (220 mg)
was applied uniformly on 10-cm2 area on the donor compartment side
of the dialysis membrane. On the gel, 1 mg of MPT was added in 500 ml
of PBS, and in the direct exposure, MPT was added directly on the di-
alysis membrane. The temperature of the acceptor chamber was main-
tained at 37 ± 0.5°C using a thermostatic water bath under constant
stirring. Samples were withdrawn from acceptor (1 ml) and donor
chambers (20 ml) at a regular interval of 1 hour, and an equal amount
of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was replaced. The amount of MPT that
permeated through the membrane and the amount of pNP that formed
at each time interval were analyzed using UFLC (photodiode array: SPD-
M20A, C18reverse-phase column: LC-20ADProminence Chromatograph,
Shimadzu).MPT wasdetected using 60% acetonitrile in double-distilled
water (DDW) as mobile phase at 1 ml/min, with a retention time of 5.5
min at 280 nm while maintaining the column at 40°C. For detection of
pNP, we used 22% acetonitrile, 0.5% triethylamine, and 1% trifluoroa-
cetic acid in DDW as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min through
a column maintained at 40°C with a retention time of 3.6 min.
Similarly, in another set of experiment, we replaced the solution in
the acceptor chamber with rat blood 1000× diluted in phosphate buffer
(pH 8.0). The entire diffusion apparatus was maintained at 5°C to main-
tain the blood AChE activity. Samples were collected at regular intervals
and analyzed using Ellman’s method (as mentioned elsewhere) for
AChE activity as a proxy for the MPT exposure.
Protection from acute exposure to MPT
Rats were randomized to one of four experimental groups (n = 6 in each
group): (i) no exposure (no MPT was given), (ii) direct exposure (MPT,
150 mg/kg), (iii) sham gel (220 mg of gel; MPT, 150 mg/kg), and (iv)
poly-Oxime gel (220 mg of gel; MPT, 150 mg/kg). Polymer concentration

 in the gel was 2% (w/w). The dorsal coat was clipped using a hair clipper
under mild anesthesia (2.5% isoflurane) 24 hours before the dermal pes-
ticide application, taking care not to damage the integrity of the skin.
Unless specified otherwise, the total area of 10 cm2 was marked and used
for dermal exposure experiments. In gel treatment groups, 220 mg of gel
was uniformly applied 1 hour before the pesticide exposure (Fig. 3).
Before exposure, 200 ml of blood was collected using retro-orbital punc-
ture and evaluated for various parameters as an internal control. After
96 hours of post-exposure, blood was collected using cardiac puncture
under anesthesia. After sacrificing the animals, organs such as brain,
heart, lungs, and liver were harvested. Organ tissue was homogenized
(Polytron PT-MR 2100, 15,000 rpm) in nine volumes of solution D
[1 M NaCl, 1% TritonX-100, 0.01 M tris-HCl, 0.01 M EDTA(pH 7.4)]
andincubatedonicefor1hour, followedbycentrifugation at13,300rpm
for 45 min. The supernatant was used to quantitate active AChE. Whole
blood diluted 1:1000 in phosphate buffer was used for AChE quantifica-
tion. The activity of AChE in blood and organs was quantified by mod-
ified Ellman’s assay. In this assay, we used DTNB and ASChI, which is
specific for AChE. For the colorimetric assay, according to Ellman’s
method, reaction mixtures were made up in 0.1 mM phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mM DTNB and ASChI at a final concentration
of20mM.Thereactionwasperformedat25°Candmonitoredat405nm.
Survival and AChE inhibition study in rats exposed to MPT
multiple times
Rats were randomized to three groups (n = 6 rats per group): (i) direct
exposure (no gel, MPT given dermally, 100 mg/kg per day for 4 days),
(ii) sham gel (220 mg of sham gel applied daily dermally 30 min before
the MPT exposure), and (iii) poly-Oxime gel [220 mg of gel applied dai-
ly dermally before applying MPT (100 mg/kg per day) daily for 4 days]
(Fig. 4A). In all animals before exposure, 200 ml of blood was collected
using retro-orbital puncture and evaluated for AChE activity as an in-
ternal control. Immediately after mortality or on day 30, animals were
sacrificed, and their organs were collected to quantify the AChE level as
described above. Similarly, another set of a single application of gel
experiments was performed (n = 6 rats per group). In this experiment,
220mgofshamgelorpoly-Oximegelwasappliedonlyonce,i.e.,onday0,
and on the same gels, these animals received MPT (100 mg/kg per day)
for 4 days (Fig. 4D).
Rotarod test
A total of 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats (10 weeks) were used to study
the loss of endurance in MPT-exposed animals and the ability of poly-
Oxime gel to prevent the same. Animals were placed on a Rotarod
treadmill (Rotamex-5 1.4, Columbus Instruments; lane width, 9.3 cm;
diameter of rod, 7 cm; fall distance, 48.3 cm), subjected to a uniform
increase in acceleration between 0 and 20 rpm, and allowed to run at
20 rpm until the animal got tired and fell off the rod, and the time of fall
was recorded. Rats were trained for 3 days before the exposure, where
animals were randomly grouped into three groups: (i) direct exposure,
(ii) poly-Oxime gel–treated, and (iii) control. On day 4, animals of the
direct exposure group were exposed to a dosage of 150 mg/kg, and the
animals of treatment group were given poly-Oxime gel and then ex-
posed to the same dosage of MPT. Latency to fall was calculated as
the time taken to fall on any day with respect to day 4 (before exposure)
and was converted to percentage.
Similarly, to study NMC, 15 animals were trained on an increasing
rotarod acceleration between 2 and 60 rpm, with an acceleration step of
4 rpm every 8 s. On day 5 of training, animals were divided into three
groups: (i) direct exposure, (ii) poly-Oxime gel–treated, and (iii) naïve
control. On day 5, animals of the direct exposure group were exposed to
a dosage of 150 mg/kg, and the animals of treatment group were given
poly-Oxime gel and then exposed to the same dosage of MPT. Animals
were given a score of +1 for each step up in the acceleration (increase by
4 rpm) before the fall, and the percentage of NMC was calculated with
respect to day 5 (before exposure).
Gait analysis and EMG
Gait analysis was performed on 15 male rats (10 weeks old) to evaluate
their walking pattern. To obtain footprints, four paws were colored with
different nontoxic water colors and animal was trained to walk through
an ally (width, 8 cm; length, 120 cm; height, 10 cm), leading to its home
cage. After training, animals were divided randomly into three groups:
(i) direct exposure, (ii) poly-Oxime gel–treated, and (iii) naïve control.
Footprints were analyzed manually, and SFI was calculated using
following formula (40, 41)

where N indicates normal/before exposure, E indicates after exposure,
TOF is the distance to the opposite foot, PL is the distance from the heel
to the third toe (the print length), TS is the distance from the first toe to
the fifth toe (the toe spread), and IT is the distance from the second toe
to the fourth toe (the intermediate toe spread).
EMG of animals from these three groups was recorded using
Muscle SpikerBox (Backyard Brains). Skin surface electrodes were
used with adhesive pads and conductive gel to facilitate the record-
ings. To track the muscle spasms under anesthesia (2.5% isoflurane
in carbogen), EMG from biceps femoris of left hind limb was re-
corded. To avoid animal from disturbing the electrodes, we recorded
EMG between spinotrapezius and gluteus maximus when the animal
was awake.
Statistical analysis
The two-tailed Student’s t test was used to compare differences be-
tween two experimental groups. In experiments with multiple groups,
one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test was used. In survival
experiments, Mantel-Cox test was used. P < 0.05 was considered as a
statistically significant difference. Statistical analysis and graphing were
performed with Prism 6 (GraphPad Software).
