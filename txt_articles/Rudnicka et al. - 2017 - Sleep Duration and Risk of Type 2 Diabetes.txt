BACKGROUND: Associations between sleep duration and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk markers in 
childhood have been little studied. We examined associations between self-reported sleep 
duration and T2D risk markers in children.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 4525 multiethnic UK children aged 9 to 10 years. Sleep 
time was calculated from self-reported usual time of going to bed and getting up on a 
school day, validated in a subset using accelerometers. Fasting blood samples provided 
levels of serum lipids and insulin, plasma glucose, and HbA1c. Physical measures included 
height, weight, bioimpedance, and blood pressure. Multilevel linear regression models of 
anthropometric, T2D, and cardiovascular risk markers with sleep duration were adjusted 
for sex, age, month, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, observer (physical measures only), 
and random effect of school.
RESULTS: On average, children slept 10.5 hours per night (95% range 8.0–12.0 hours). There 
were strong inverse graded relationships between sleep duration, adiposity, and diabetes 
risk markers. In adjusted models, a 1-hour-longer sleep duration was associated with 0.19 
lower BMI (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09 to 0.28), 0.03 kg/m5 lower fat mass index 
(95% CI 0.00 to 0.05 kg/m5), 2.9% lower homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance 
(95% CI 1.2% to 4.4%), and 0.24% lower fasting glucose (95% CI 0.03% to 0.44%); there 
was no association with HbA1c or cardiovascular risk. Associations with insulin and 
glucose remained after an additional adjustment for adiposity markers.
CONCLUSIONS: The finding of an inverse association between sleep duration and T2D risk 
markers in childhood is novel. Intervention studies are needed to establish the causality of 
these associations, which could provide a simple strategy for early T2D prevention.

WhAt’S KNOWN ON thIS SUbjECt: Shorter sleep 
duration has been associated with type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) in adults and with obesity in both adults and 
children. However, associations between sleep 
duration and T2D risk markers in childhood have 
been little studied.
WhAt thIS StUDy ADDS: This study demonstrates 
a novel graded association between short sleep 
duration and elevated T2D risk markers in a large, 
multiethnic population of 9- to 10-year-old children. 
The report confirms the association between short 
sleep duration and body fatness.

 The prevalence of type 2 diabetes 
(T2D), overweight, and obesity has 
been rising in the United Kingdom 
and in many other countries, 
1, 
 
2 not 
only in adults but also in adolescents 
and children.3 Understanding the 
early determinants of adiposity and 
T2D risk in young people could be 
particularly important for reducing 
the risks of T2D and obesity across 
the life course.
There has been particular interest 
in the importance of sleep for T2D 
and adiposity risks. Sleep duration 
has complex prospective relations 
with adiposity and T2D in adults, and 
both short and long sleep durations 
are associated with higher risk.4 
– 
6 In 
contrast, studies in childhood have 
shown graded inverse associations 
between sleep duration and levels 
of adiposity, with increased sleep 
duration associated with lower 
levels of obesity; there has been little 
evidence that longer sleep duration is 
associated with increased adiposity.5, 
7  
However, little is known about the 
effects of sleep on other T2D risk 
markers in childhood, particularly 
glycemic blood markers and insulin 
resistance. Such associations could be 
of public health importance; whereas 
sleep durations have appeared 
relatively stable in adulthood, 
8 recent 
evidence suggests that average sleep 
duration has declined in children and 
adolescents over time (particularly 
over the last 15 years, during which 
actual sleep duration has declined 
by 0.73 minutes per year).9 The 
ramifications of this reduced sleep 
duration on future health are yet 
to be established. However, if 
shorter sleep duration is related 
to emerging T2D risk in childhood, 
evidence on optimal sleep duration 
for protecting against T2D risk could 
underpin efforts to prevent T2D risk 
at an early stage.10 Moreover, early 
ethnic differences in T2D precursors 
(particularly in South Asian children, 
who have a worse metabolic profile 
compared with children of white 
European ancestry11) might be 
partially explained by differences in 
sleep duration. If so, this may offer an 
additional strategy to reduce ethnic 
differences in T2D risk in early life.
We therefore examined the 
associations between self-
reported sleep duration, T2D, and 
cardiovascular risk factors in a large-
scale, multiethnic population-based 
study of 9- to 10-year-old children.
MEthODS
The Child Heart and Health 
Study in England (CHASE) was a 
cross-sectional investigation of 
the cardiovascular and T2D risk 
profiles of UK primary school 
children aged 9 to 10 years of white 
European, South Asian, and black 
African-Caribbean origins. Ethical 
approval was obtained from the 
relevant multicenter research ethics 
committee. Full details of study 
methods have been published.11 The 
study was based in 200 state primary 
schools in London, Birmingham, and 
Leicester, half with a high prevalence 
of UK South Asian children 
(stratified by Indian, Pakistani, and 
Bangladeshi origin) and half with a 
high prevalence of UK black African-
Caribbean children (stratified by 
black African and black Caribbean 
origin). Informed parental consent 
and child assent were obtained.
Measurements of body Composition
A single survey team of 3 trained 
research nurses made all the 
measurements between October 
2004 and February 2007; to limit 
ethnic differences in observer 
bias, each observer measured 
approximately one-third of the 
children in each ethnic group. Height 
and weight were measured, and 
BMI was calculated as kilograms 
per meter squared. To provide an 
objective measure of adiposity, fat 
mass was determined from arm-
to-leg bioelectrical impedance and 
measured on the right side using 
the Bodystat 1500 bioelectrical 
impedance monitor (Bodystat Ltd, 
Douglas, Isle of Man, UK). Fat mass 
was derived by using equations 
derived specifically for UK children 
of this age group, which were specific 
to sex and ethnic group.12 Fat mass 
was height standardized (fat mass 
index = fat mass [kilograms]/height 
[in meters]5). Skinfold thicknesses 
were also measured to provide a 
subcutaneous measure of adiposity at 
the biceps, triceps, and subcapsular 
and suprailiac locations. Skinfold 
thickness provides a better predictor 
of body fatness compared with 
weight-for-height measures. Seated 
blood pressure (BP) was measured 
twice in the right arm after a 
5-minute rest using an Omron HEM-
907 (Omron Electronics Ltd, Milton 
Keynes, UK) with the appropriate cuff 
size; the mean of the 2 values was 
used in analysis after an adjustment 
for cuff size.13
blood Measurements
Blood samples were obtained after an 
overnight fast; children were asked 
not to eat on the morning of the 
examination, and those who reported 
having eaten breakfast were excluded 
from analysis. Serum for insulin assay 
was separated and frozen on dry ice 
immediately after collection. All other 
samples were shipped to a central 
laboratory within 48 hours. Insulin, 
glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 
and blood lipids were measured as 
described previously. Homeostasis 
model assessment equations were 
used to provide an estimate of 
insulin resistance.14 Serum urate 
was assayed by using an enzymatic 
method.15
Questionnaire Data
Children were asked the following 
2 questions about sleeping habits 
on a school day: “What time do you 
usually go to bed on schooldays?” 
and “What time do you usually get 
up in the morning on schooldays?” 
The difference between these 2 
times was used to define sleep

 duration. The ethnic origin of a child 
was based on self-defined parental 
ethnicity (which was coded using 
a classification similar to the 2001 
UK census), if this was not available, 
parental report of the ethnic origin 
of the child (if self-defined parental 
ethnicity was not available), parental 
and grandparental places of birth as 
previously described.11 In the  
present analyses, “white European” 
includes children whose ethnic origin 
was defined as “white British, 
”  
“white Irish, 
” “white European, 
”  
or a combination of these and 
excludes “white other.” “South 
Asian” includes “Indian, 
” “Pakistani, 
”  
“Bangladeshi, 
” “Sri Lankan, 
” or a 
combination of these. Remaining 
Asian children were classified as 
“Asian other” and included Asian 
mixed ethnicities, Chinese, and 
Middle Eastern ethnic groups.  
“Black African-Caribbean” includes 
“black African, 
” “black Caribbean, 
”  
“black British, 
” “black other, 
”  
or combination of these. Children 
of other ethnic groups and mixed 
ethnic origins (except Asian) were 
allocated to a separate “other” group. 
Parental socioeconomic position 
was based on self-reported parental 
occupation and coded by using UK 
National Statistics Socioeconomic 
Classification for the parent with the 
highest grade.16 The 3-class version 
was used in all analyses (professional 
and managerial, intermediate, 
routine and manual) as previously 
described.17 Self-reported pubertal 
status was measured in girls only 
by using the Tanner development 
score.18
Physical Activity Assessment
In a subset of children recruited 
from 79 schools in the latter phase of 
the study (January 2006–February 
2007), objective assessment of 
physical activity was conducted by 
using a waist-worn accelerometer 
(ActiGraph GT1M; ActiGraph, LLC, 
Pensacola, FL). Details of the physical 
activity assessment have been 
published previously.19 In brief, 
children were asked to wear the 
monitors (worn at the waist above 
the left hip using an elasticated belt) 
during waking hours for 7 whole 
days. On return of the instruments, 
a dedicated software program was 
used to determine activity outcomes 
(including steps by hour of the 
day), allowing activities before 
and after self-reported bedtimes 
to be examined. It also allowed a 
comparison of monitor nonwear time 
with reported sleep duration.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted 
by using Stata/SE software (Stata 
13 for Windows; Stata Corp LP, 
College Station, TX). All diabetes 
and cardiovascular risk markers 
and body composition variables 
were examined for normality and 
log transformed when necessary. 
Multilevel linear regression models 
adjusted for age in quartiles, sex, 
month, ethnicity, social position, 
and random effect for school were 
used to calculate adjusted means 
for measures of body composition 
and diabetes and/or cardiovascular 
risk markers by 5 categories of 
sleep duration (<9, 9–9.9, 10–10.9, 
11–11.9, and ≥12 hours). Continuous 
linear associations with sleep 
duration in hours were determined 
by using the same adjustments; for 
outcomes that were log transformed, 
associations were quantified as the 
percentage difference per extra hour 
of sleep. Associations with sleep 
duration were also examined in boys 
and girls separately and by ethnicity. 
Effects of adjustment for pubertal 
status (girls only) were also explored. 
Linear associations between sleep 
duration, T2D, and cardiovascular 
risk markers that were statistically 
significant were further adjusted 
for measures of adiposity, including 
fat mass index and fat-free mass 
index. The contribution of sleep 
duration to previously reported 
ethnic differences in diabetes and 
cardiovascular risk markers11, 
 
20 was 
also examined.
RESULtS
Of 8641 children invited to 
participate in CHASE, 5887 (68%) 
took part. Among 5681 singleton 
children, 4525 (80%) provided 
a fasting blood sample, had 
complete data for measures of body 
composition, and self-reported data 
for bedtime and getting up time on 
a school day. On average, children 
were 10.0 years old (SD 0.4 years, 
reference range 9.2–10.7 years). 
Sleep duration was on average 10.5 
hours per night on a school day 
(95% central range 8.0–12.0 hours; 
 
Fig 1). In a subset of 1766 children 
who wore an accelerometer during 
waking hours, a mean of 600 steps 
per hour were recorded during the 
hours of 8 am to 7 pm on a school 
day but only 54 steps in the hour 
after reported bedtime, compared 
with 234 steps in the hour before 
bedtime. One hour before wake-up 
time, the number of steps recorded 
was 0 compared with an average 
of 435 steps 1 hour after wake 
time. In the subset that wore an 
accelerometer, daily nonwear time 
was 10.2 hours, and reported sleep 
duration was 10.3 hours (equivalent 
to a mean difference of 7 minutes, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 4 to 10 
minutes).
 
Table 1 shows demographic 
characteristics of the children in 
relation to sleep duration on a school 
day. Children who had longer sleep 
durations were on average slightly 
younger and more likely to be girls 
(Table 1). Sleep duration differed 
marginally by ethnicity; white 
European children had the longest 
mean sleep duration, and black 
African-Caribbean children had the 
shortest. There was no clear evidence 
of any trend in sleep duration by 
parental social position.
There were strong inverse linear 
relationships between sleep

 duration and all measures of body 
size and fatness (Fig 2, Table 2, and 
Supplemental Fig 3). Children who 
slept longer were on average shorter 
and had lower body weight, fat-free 
mass, levels of fat mass index, and 
skinfold thickness; effect sizes for 
adiposity measures (including BMI, 
sum of skinfolds, and leptin) were 
statistically significant and between 
1% and 3% per extra hour of sleep. 
Sleep duration was also inversely 
related to insulin, insulin resistance, 
and glucose. Per extra hour of sleep, 
insulin levels were lower by nearly 
3% (95% CI 1.2% to 4.5% reduction), 
and a similar association was seen 
for insulin resistance (Table 2). 
The size of the association with 
glucose was smaller, and there was 
no clear evidence of an association 
with HbA1c (Table 2). There was 
no evidence of associations with 
lipids or BP. Similar strengths of 
associations were found in analyses 
stratified by ethnicity and sex 
(Supplemental Table 4). There was 
no consistent evidence of effect 
modification by sex (likelihood 
ratio test for interaction with sex 
had a P value >.1 for all measures of 
body size and cardiometabolic risk 
markers) or ethnicity (likelihood 
ratio test had a P value >.2 for 
interaction in all instances).
In addition to the factors adjusted 
for in Table 2, Table 3 shows that 
associations with insulin and 
insulin resistance were slightly 
attenuated, with further adjustment 
for height (Table 3; model 1). 
Additional adjustments for fat 
mass index (model 2), fat-free mass 
index (model 3), or both (model 4) 
attenuated the associations further 
for insulin and insulin resistance 
and were no longer statistically 
significant after an adjustment for 
fat-free mass index. In the fully 
adjusted model 4, coefficients 
were approximately halved when 
compared with coefficients in Table 2

 We examined ethnic differences in 
T2D precursors before and after 
adjusting for sleep duration. Compared 
with white Europeans, black African-
Caribbean children had 8.5% higher 
levels of insulin (95% CI 3.2% to 
14.0%) after adjustment for age 
quartiles, sex, height, month, and social 
position; this difference reduced to 
7.6% higher (95% CI 2.3% to 13.3%)

 DISCUSSION
Main Findings
The current study is novel in showing 
inverse associations between 
reported sleep duration and T2D 
risk factors in early life, which 
are independent of adiposity and 
observed in different ethnicities. 
It also shows strong inverse 
associations between reported sleep 
duration and adiposity (including 
detailed measures of body fatness), 
confirming findings from earlier 
studies. Given the rising prevalence 
of diabetes worldwide and especially 
in low- to middle-income countries, 
we believe our findings will help 
motivate further simple, pragmatic 
trials in this area.
Relation to Earlier Studies
Both short and long sleep durations 
have been linked to adiposity and 
T2D in adulthood.4 
– 
6 Previous cross-
sectional observations in childhood 
have shown an inverse association 
between sleep duration, levels of 
BMI, and obesity (with 0.75 lower 
BMI for every additional hour of 
sleep21), and pooled estimates 
suggest short durations of sleep are 
associated with a near doubling of 
obesity prevalence compared with 
long durations.5, 
 
22 These associations 
have also been confirmed in an 
analysis of prospective studies 
in childhood, which have shown 
slightly smaller associations, with 
0.5 lower BMI per hour of sleep.23 
These observations concur with 
adult observations, in which pooled 
findings suggest inverse associations 
between sleep duration, BMI, and 
obesity.5 The current study confirms 
the inverse association with BMI 
and extends these observations by 
demonstrating strong graded inverse 
associations with more detailed 
measures of adiposity, including 
sum of skinfolds and bioelectrical 
impedance-derived measures of fat 
mass. Inverse associations between 
height and sleep duration may well 
be explained by maturation, with 
more mature children tending to 
have later weekday bedtimes. The 
inverse association with leptin is of 
particular interest because this may 
allude to a biological mechanism of 
effect by which increased sleep may 
alter appetite by downregulation 
of leptin production, 
24 although we 
accept that circulating leptin levels 
generally reflect fat mass in stable-
weight individuals. This agrees with 
earlier work suggesting that short 
sleep durations in childhood are 
associated with a higher intake of 
energy-dense and sugary foods.25
The current study is also novel in 
demonstrating inverse associations 
between reported sleep duration and 
T2D risk markers, including insulin, 
insulin resistance, and blood glucose 
(although associations with HbA1c 
were marginal). These associations 
appear to be partially independent 
of the detailed adiposity measures. 
In one previous, small study (with 
a sample size of 245 participants), 
Matthews et al26 showed an inverse 
association between sleep duration 
and homeostasis model assessment 
measures of insulin resistance in 
adolescence. However, we are not 
aware of any other population-
based studies that have reported 
similar associations earlier in 
childhood except among high-risk 
obese children.27 Sleep duration did 
not appear to explain early ethnic 
differences in T2D risk that were 
previously reported, particularly the 
higher levels of insulin resistance 
and glycemia among South Asian 
children.11
The current study also provided 
the opportunity to examine sleep 
durations and cardiovascular risk 
factors (including blood lipids and 
BP) when there was no consistent 
evidence of an association. These 
null findings are in agreement 
with a limited number of earlier 
observations in childhood, 
28, 
 
29 
suggesting that sleep duration does 
not alter other cardiovascular risks 
in early life other than by increasing 
obesity and metabolic risks, which, if 
sustained or accentuated, take time 
to accelerate cardiovascular risks.
Strengths and Limitations
The current study has a number of 
strengths and limitations that require 
further consideration. The study 
was large and included a multiethnic 
child population. Although ethnic 
differences in sleep duration were 
observed (white European children 
slept the longest and black African 
children the shortest), associations 
with adiposity measures and T2D 
risk were consistent across ethnic 
groups. Moreover, associations were

 not materially altered by adjustments 
for socioeconomic position and 
pubertal status (in girls only), and 
they remained after adjustments 
for other potential confounders (ie, 
sleep-T2D associations remained 
after an adjustment for measures 
of adiposity). The study was cross 
sectional, which should not be judged 
as a disadvantage given the plausible 
short-term effects of sleep duration on 
cardiometabolic risk. The possibility of 
reverse causality, in which metabolic 
dysregulation alters sleep patterns, 
seems unlikely given the child 
population.30 Reassuringly, findings 
were consistent with observations 
from longitudinal studies as outlined 
above. One potential weakness was 
that sleep duration was derived from 
weekday self-reported bedtimes and 
not weekend reported bedtimes, which 
may underestimate total weekly sleep 
durations.31 However, the reported 
mean and distribution of sleep time 
were in keeping with other studies of 
similarly aged children (ie, mean 10.3, 
SD 1.1 hours versus mean 10.5, SD 0.7 
hours in a large cohort of children aged 
9 years).32 Accelerometer assessment 
in a subset19 provided further 
validation of sleep time by showing 
similar monitor nonwear time and 
reported sleep duration and that, on 
average, children recorded few steps 
1 hour before compared with 1 hour 
after reported wake time and far fewer 
steps 1 hour after compared with 1 
before reported bedtime. However, a 
reduction or absence of steps may not 
fully reflect sleep, only rest, because 
other sedentary activities could 
be taking place. Moreover, waking 
time accelerometry (as opposed to 
sleep-time accelerometry) does not 
allow sleep quality to be assessed, 
which could plausibly exert metabolic 
effects.33
Biological mechanisms by which 
sleep may alter T2D risk have been 
proposed, including the dysregulation 
of neuroendocrine control of 
appetite.24, 
 
34 This lends weight to a 
potentially causal association. If the 
association is indeed causal, it would 
be important to establish evidence-
based sleep-time recommendations, 
which would be particularly relevant 
given trends toward decreasing sleep 
time in contemporary children.9 
However, robust experimental 
evidence (ie, trials) of the association 
between sleep duration and T2D 
risk is needed before causality can 
be inferred. Unfortunately, evidence 
from a small number of experimental 
studies in childhood and adulthood 
examining the effects of changing 
sleep duration on adiposity has so 
far been inconclusive largely because 
the effects of interventions on sleep 
duration have been modest.35, 
36 
Hence, interventions that are more 
effective in altering sleep duration 
are needed. Establishing causality 
is a priority because increasing 
sleep duration could offer a simple, 
cost-effective approach to reducing 
adiposity and T2D risk from early life.
CONCLUSIONS
In the current study, increasing the 
mean weekday sleep duration (10.5 
hours) by half an hour could be 
associated with 0.1 lower BMI and a 
0.5% reduction in insulin resistance. 
These differences should be considered 
in relation to the following, which is 
the largest observed ethnic difference 
in BMI and insulin resistance within 
this study population: children of 
South Asian origin had 30% higher 
insulin resistance11 and 0.4 lower 
BMI compared with children of white 
European ancestry.37 If experimental 
evidence were to corroborate the 
associations observed between 
sleep duration and T2D precursors 
(allowing a causal association to be 
inferred), these effects could plausibly 
persist into later life. Levels of insulin 
resistance in childhood have been 
shown to impact T2D risk over a 
10-year period and may magnify with 
increasing age.38 Hence, reducing 
levels even by modest amounts in 
childhood may have longer-term 
implications for reduced T2D in later 
life.39 Furthermore, greater weight gain 
trajectories in childhood are associated 
with greater risks for adolescent 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 
which is a well-accepted precursor to 
diabetes risks.40
