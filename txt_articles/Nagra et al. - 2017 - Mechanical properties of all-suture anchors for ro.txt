Mechanical properties of all-suture 
anchors for rotator cuff repair
Objectives
All-suture anchors are increasingly used in rotator cuff repair procedures. potential ben-
efits include decreased bone damage. However, there is limited published evidence for 
the relative strength of fixation for all-suture anchors compared with traditional anchors.
Materials and Methods
A total of four commercially available all-suture anchors, the ‘Y-Knot’ (conMed), Q-FIX 
(smith & nephew), IconIX (stryker) and JuggerKnot (Zimmer Biomet) and a traditional 
anchor control TWInFIX Ultra pK suture Anchor (smith & nephew) were tested in cadaveric 
human humeral head rotator cuff repair models (n = 24). This construct underwent cyclic 
loading applied by a mechanical testing rig (Zwick/Roell). Ultimate load to failure, gap for-
mation at 50, 100, 150 and 200 cycles, and failure mechanism were recorded. significance 
was set at p < 0.05.
Results
overall, mean maximum tensile strength values were significantly higher for the traditional 
anchor (181.0 n, standard error (se) 17.6) compared with the all-suture anchors (mean 
133.1 n se 16.7) (p = 0.04). The JuggerKnot anchor had greatest displacement at 50, 100 
and 150 cycles, and at failure, reaching statistical significance over the control at 100 and 
150 cycles (22.6 mm se 2.5 versus 12.5 mm se 0.3; and 29.6 mm se 4.8 versus 17.0 mm se 
0.7). every all-suture anchor tested showed substantial (> 5 mm) displacement between 
50 and 100 cycles (6.2 to 14.3).
All-suture anchors predominantly failed due to anchor pull-out (95% versus 25% of tra-
ditional anchors), whereas a higher proportion of traditional anchors failed secondary to 
suture breakage.
Conclusion
We demonstrate decreased failure load, increased total displacement, and variable failure 
mechanisms in all-suture anchors, compared with traditional anchors designed for rotator 
cuff repair. These findings will aid the surgeon’s choice of implant, in the context of the 
clinical scenario.

Introduction
anchorage of sutures in the repair of rotator cuff (rC) 
tears has traditionally made use of large, screw-shaped 
anchors consisting of either metal or plastic polymer 
materials to secure sutures into bone. However, over the 
last decade, a novel fixation technique has emerged. 
Initially designed for labral and capsular tear repairs, ‘all-
suture’ anchors are increasingly being used in rC tear 
repair surgery. Placement of all-suture anchors generally 
involves drilling a small pilot hole into the bone, and sub-
sequently placing suture material in a latent configura-
tion attached to a catheter device, which allows the 
suture to expand in the cancellous bone under the cortex 
as the catheter is removed.
rC repair is a procedure which has a reported failure 
rate of between 13%1 and 94% (as defined by re-rupture 
post repair).2 Some authors have claimed that all-suture 
anchors facilitate easier revision after surgical failure 
because they are designed to preserve bone stock and 
improve post-operative imaging after surgery.3
Previous studies have endeavoured to look into the 
mechanical properties of all-suture anchors and compare 
these with traditional bone anchors.4-9 However, such 
studies have been incomplete: studying only one all-
suture anchor at a time;7 studying only mechanical prop-
erties such as maximum tensile strength;4 or using less 
relevant canine,9 bovine,6 porcine,4,5 and human tibial8 
models to demonstrate the mechanical properties of all-
suture anchors in the human humeral head. Furthermore, 
studies have shown the maximum tensile strength of 
anchors to range from 49 N to 66 N in one paper,8 to 760 
N in another,5 highlighting the need for a comprehensive 
evaluation of all commercially available all-suture anchors 
in comparison with traditional anchors.
The aim of this study was to compare the mechanical 
properties (failure load and cyclic displacement) and fail-
ure mechanisms of all-suture anchors with those of a tra-
ditional suture anchor in cadaveric human humeral 
heads. The null hypothesis of the study was that the 
mechanical properties and failure mode of novel com-
mercial all-suture anchors would be the same as those of 
a traditional bone anchor.
Materials and Methods
Cadaveric sample acquisition. a total of 24 cadav-
eric samples were obtained from the Department of 
Physiology, anatomy and Genetics, university of oxford 
(oxford, united Kingdom). The humeral heads were dis-
sected from cadaveric donors and overlying soft-tissue 
was debrided to expose the bone surface over the greater 
tuberosity. The humerus was isolated from the distal 
upper limb 10 cm below its surgical neck. Macroscopic 
examination was used to exclude obvious deformity and 
bony defects within samples by two authors (NSN, rDJS). 
all samples were kept hydrated in 0.9% saline prior to 
transfer for anchor insertion and subsequent mechanical 
testing (n = 24, 12 matched pairs, age range 58 to 96, 4:2 
ratio of men:women).
Anchors tested. a review of the literature and a search 
through the procurement department of our tertiary 
referral centre hospital was conducted to determine cur-
rent commercially available all-suture anchors (accurate 
as of april 2016), of which four were found. all four 
types of commercially available all-suture anchors and 
one traditional plastic anchor were obtained from the 
manufacturers. all-suture anchors tested included the 
y-Knot (ConMed, New york, New york), Q-FIX (Smith & 
Nephew, london, united Kingdom), ICoNIX (Stryker, 
Kalamazoo, Michigan) and JuggerKnot (Zimmer biomet, 
Warsaw, Indiana). a commonly used traditional plas-
tic anchor (TWINFIX ultra PK Suture anchors, Smith & 
Nephew) was used as a comparator and control. all 
tested anchors had polyethylene (flat braided ultra-high 
molecular weight polyethylene (uHMWPe); y-Knot) or 
braided polyester #2 sutures for tendon interfaces.
all described anchors are indicated for both open and 
arthroscopic rC repair. variations in size and suture type 
are available for other procedures including repair of 
bankart and SlaP (superior labral tears from anterior to 
posterior) lesions, biceps tenodesis, acromioclavicular 
joint dislocation reconstruction, deltoid repair and cap-
sulolabral repair. However, these sizes were not tested.
ICoNIX 3 anchors are composed of three strands of 
‘Force Fiber’ suture (uHMWPe, polypropylene and nylon) 
enclosed in a sheath structure, which bunches under ten-
sion to form a suture-anchor (uHMWPe). The ICoNIX is 
designed to deploy under tension applied by the sur-
geon, with a minimum of 10 N of force. Initially, a guide 
is placed over the greater tuberosity before a self-tapping 
2.3 mm awl is engaged through the guide and advanced 
to break through the cortex and displace underlying 
bone until a positive stop is achieved. The awl is removed 
and the anchor is placed through the guide and, using a 
mallet, advanced until a positive stop is achieved. The 
suture ends are untethered from the anchor inserter, and 
both the inserter and guide are removed. It should be 
noted that other sizes of ICoNIX anchor are available and 
indicated for rC repair surgery, however, literature pub-
lished by the manufacturer states that the ICoNIX 3 is the 
strongest (defined by maximum tensile strength) anchor 
within the range.10
Q-FIX anchors consist of a braided polyester anchor 
implant encompassing two #2 ‘MagnumWire’ sutures 
(uHMWPe). The implant is placed by pushing a drill 
guide and associated obturator through soft tissues until 
 84

they approximate cortex. once the soft tissue has been 
navigated, the obturator is removed, leaving the drill 
guide overlying the cortex. a 3 mm drill bit is placed 
through the drill guide to breach the cortex and create a 
bone hole – this is terminated when the drill bottoms 
onto the guide and no further progress can be made. The 
drill is subsequently removed and replaced with the 
Q-FIX implant inserter which goes into the guide. once 
the implant inserter is fully engaged (meaning the distal 
end of the inserter is within the newly formed bone tun-
nel), the ‘activation knob’ of the implant inserter is then 
rotated clockwise about its axis to deploy the spherical 
suture-anchor to a reported internal force of 140 N.11 
Suture ends are separated from the inserter and the 
inserter and guide are removed.
y-Knot anchors are made of three ‘HiFi’ sutures 
(uHMWPe, polypropylene and nylon), contained within 
a ‘HiFi’ flat braided suture tape (uHMWPe). There are two 
possible insertion techniques for placement of the y-Knot. 
The first, a self-tapping technique, involves placing the 
tip of the inserter on to the cortex and subsequently 
using a mallet to impact the inserter with suture attached 
into the bone. Circumferential laser-marks indicate the 
range of the depth to which the inserter can be pressed. 
a second option, for harder bone, is to create a 2.8 mm 
pilot hole before insertion of the suture in a manner simi-
lar to that already described. Thereafter, sutures are 
unwound from the inserter and the construct is removed. 
all suture strands are then pulled and the anchor is com-
pressed against the cortical bone.  
JuggerKnot anchors are formed from two #2 
‘Maxbraid’ (uHMWPe) sutures engaged on an insertion 
device within a braided polyester anchor implant. after 
initially boring through the cortex with a 2.9 mm drill, the 
anchor is inserted and deployed under tension to cause 
the braided polyester to gather under the cortex and 
secure the anchor.
Loading protocol. all suture anchors were placed into the 
anterior and proximal aspect of the greater tuberosity, 1 
cm posterior to the bicipital groove, in accordance with 
the manufacturer’s instructions using suggested inser-
tion tools and techniques after instruction from a manu-
facturer’s representative. The humeral shaft was pierced 
along its length and secured within a custom-designed 
platform with screws. The suture threads emerging from 
the humeral head were secured within the upper clamps 
of the rig, with no recorded failure in any repeats at the 
suture-vice interface (Fig. 1).
Cyclical loading using a previously published protocol 
to simulate the rehabilitation phase of post-rotator cuff 
tendon repair12 was used (see supplementary material). 
Tensile testing to failure was then performed using a 
Zwick/roell tensile testing machine (Zwick roell Group, 
ulm, Germany) and a 10 kN load cell, with a clamp-to-
clamp distance of 100 mm. an initial 10 N tension was 
placed on the anchors to ensure proper deployment of 
the subcortical segment of the all-suture anchors and to 
prevent loading artefacts.6 Maximum tensile strength 
and displacement of the construct were measured by 
means of the experimental configuration demonstrated 
(Fig. 1), using the intrinsic force and distance calculators 
of the tensile testing machine (testXpert II; Zwick roell 
Group) which calculates tensile force deployed by the 
load cell, and change in distance between the two 
clamps. Mechanism of failure (suture or interface) was 
also recorded. a minimum of four repeats were con-
ducted for each implant (n ≥ 4).
Cadaveric samples were distributed such that a combi-
nation of left and right humeral heads from the same 
patient were used with different anchors, and different 
anchors were used with different cadaver ages to ensure 
matched ages and distribution amongst samples.
Statistical analysis. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analyses were 
performed to compare the tensile mechanical properties 
of the different commercial suture anchors and traditional 
bone anchor to determine initial variance. Post hoc analy-
sis was performed using the Dunn test. Comparisons of

Mechanical properties of all-suture anchors for rotator cuff repair
Bone & Joint research
all-suture anchors against the traditional bone anchor 
were made using Student’s t-test. all statistical tests had 
a significance level of p < 0.05 (and are reported to one 
significant figure below 0.05) and were performed using 
GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software Inc., la 
Jolla, California).
Results
Tensile strength. Statistically significant variance was 
noted between anchor types and between all-suture 
anchors with regard to maximum failure and displace-
ment (Tables I13,14 and II).
Maximum tensile strength was significantly greater in 
the control anchor (mean and standard error: 181.0 N, 
 
se 17.6) and Q-FIX (144.9 N, se 13.4) over the ICoNIX 
(103.9 N, se 10.1) anchors (p = 0.02, p = 0.04 and p = 
0.03, respectively) (Table I, Fig. 2). JuggerKnot and 
y-Knot anchors (137.8 se 20.3 N and 145.8 se 23.1 N, 
respectively) did not have significantly different tensile 
strength values when compared with other anchors.
The mean maximum tensile strength value was signifi-
cantly higher for the traditional anchor (181.0 N, se 17.6) 
compared with the all-suture anchors (mean 133.1 N, 
 
se 16.7; p = 0.04).
Gap formation of construct. Displacement, after initial 
application of load, was recorded during cyclic loading. 
Comparisons were not made at 200 cycles as the majority 
of anchors failed before this point (88.2% of all-suture 
anchors). The JuggerKnot anchor had the greatest dis-
placement at 50, 100 and 150 cycles and also at failure, 
though this did not reach statistical significance over any 
other all-suture anchors (Table II) apart from the Q-FIX 
anchor at failure (Fig. 3). The JuggerKnot anchor did have 
significantly greater displacement over control anchors at 
100 and 150 cycles (22.6 mm, se 2.5 versus 12.5 mm, 
 
se 0.3, p = 0.01; and 29.6 mm, se 4.8 versus 17.0 mm, 
 
se 0.7, p = 0.03, respectively).

With the exception of the Q-FIX (4.9 mm, se 1.2), all-
suture anchors showed significant displacement between 
50 and 100 cycles (defined as > 5 mm during loading, 
range 6.2 to 14.3)15,16 (Table II, Fig. 3).
Moreover, all anchors demonstrated significant dis-
placement between 0 and 50 cycles (range 6.9 to 9.2) and 
also between 100 and 150 cycles (range 5.8 to 6.7), except 
the ICoNIX, which did not reach this cycle number.
The JuggerKnot implant had the greatest increase in 
displacement between 50 and 100 cycles, with mean dis-
placement of 14.3 mm (se 2.2), which was significantly 
greater than that of the Q-FIX implant (p = 0.03). 
otherwise, there was no significant variation between 
displacement values of the anchors.
additional analysis of displacement was performed 
to determine changes in displacement (differentials) 
after the first 50 cycles to accommodate initial anchor 
settling. Displacement between 50 and 100 cycles, 50 
and 150 cycles, and 50 cycles to failure were determined 
(Table III).
between 50 and 100 cycles, the JuggerKnot demon-
strated the greatest mean displacement (12.3 mm, se 2.6),

Mechanical properties of all-suture anchors for rotator cuff repair
Bone & Joint research
which reached statistical significance against the control 
and Q-Fix anchors (5.1 mm, se 0.4 and 4.9 mm, se 1.2; p = 
0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). a similar pattern was 
found between cycles 50 and 150, whereby the JuggerKnot 
anchor had the greatest displacement (21.0 mm, se 3.8), 
which was statistically significant against the control 
anchor (9.6 mm, se 1.1; p = 0.02). However, when com-
paring displacement between 50 cycles and failure, there 
was no statistically significant variation between anchors.
Failure mechanism. experimental constructs failed by 
a variety of mechanisms, with the majority of all-suture 
anchors failing by anchor pull-out, whereby anchor integ-
rity was maintained. However, cortical failure occurred in 
95% of all-suture anchors and 25% of traditional bone 
anchors. a higher proportion of traditional bone anchors 
failed due to the suture itself breaking, suggesting greater 
strength of anchor fixation (5% of all-suture anchors ver-
sus 50% of traditional bone anchors).
Discussion
This study compared the mechanical properties of cur-
rently marketed commercial all-suture anchors, using a 
biologically representative ex vivo model, with a tradi-
tional bone anchor comparator. The study found that the 
load-to-failure was lower and displacement was signifi-
cantly greater in some all-suture anchors compared with 
a control traditional anchor. These findings are consistent 
with previously published literature in non-human speci-
mens.4,6,9 The mechanical properties of bone vary accord-
ing to structure (particularly the thickness of the cortex), 
species of animal and site tested, thus adding weight to 
the argument that tests to determine strength of implants 
should be standardised in an anatomically and biologi-
cally representative model.5 This study is representative 
of the environment into which these anchor types are 
being placed, more so than previous work, which has 
looked at retention strength in animal, polyurethane and 
human diaphyseal bone.4,5,6,17
although we discuss here load-to-failure and displace-
ment as important mechanical characteristics to define 
the properties of anchors, these in themselves may be too 
simplistic to determine the value of implants for rC 
repair. Due to their smaller size, a greater number of all-
suture anchors can be placed in the same area of bone, 
allowing for greater strength of fixation and decreased 
gap formation.6,12 Indeed, one study showed that no 
demonstrable difference was detected between the 
 
pull-out strengths of two all-suture anchors (JuggerKnot 
1.4 mm) and one traditional anchor (PeeK Zip 5.5 mm, 
Stryker).6 It should also be noted that the surface area to 
volume ratio of all-suture anchors is greater than tradi-
tional anchors because of their smaller size.12 Previous 
work has shown that the smaller all-suture anchors have 
greater fixation ‘per unit area’ of soft tissue, and therefore 
have a relatively greater fixation per unit of volume.12
Despite this, recent work from Pfeiffer et al9 suggests 
that, within a canine model, an all-suture anchors pro-
mote cavity formation secondary to foreign-body reac-
tion, with resulting expansion of the initial drill tunnel. 
on the other hand, traditional anchors were found to 
maintain the initial drill tunnel size. The relative bio-
incompatibility of all-suture anchors could predicate 
weaker load-to-failure values after long-term implanta-
tion. However, this concept requires further study.
Generally speaking, the findings reported in this study 
are consistent with those reported in the literature. 
ultimately, all anchors aim for minimum gap formation 
and maximum tensile strength. The maximum pull-out 
strength values reported are comparable with those of 
previous studies which have performed similar tests using 
all-suture anchors, with slight variations in materials and 
methodology.6,18,19
In a bovine humeral model, Galland et al6 found that 
although traditional anchors had higher mean tensile 
strength and lower elongation values at failure, there was 
no statistical difference between those and all-suture 
anchors. These findings are echoed by Mazzocca et al18 
who found, in a glenoid labral repair model in human 
bone, that no difference could be demonstrated in ulti-
mate load to failure and displacement at ultimate failure 
(anchor pull-out) between the all-suture and traditional 
anchors, despite greater mean values in the former group 
(171.9 N versus 146.0 N, respectively). They also found 
that traditional anchors required significantly higher 
loads to achieve 2 mm of labral displacement than did 
all-suture anchors (84.1 N versus 39.2 N).
of note, the anchors in the current study had a vari-
ety of failure mechanisms, typifying the difference in 
Table III. Mean displacement differential values and standard error (se) (mm) of tested anchors between 50 cycles and: 100 cycles, 150 cycles, and failure. 
ICoNIX anchors did not reach 150 cycles, therefore these data are not included

construction between all-suture and traditional anchors 
(Table I). all-suture anchors failed predominantly by 
anchor pull-out (95%) which can be attributed to con-
struct failure. This is in contrast to the traditional 
anchors, which failed by a combination of suture failure, 
anchor pull-out or eyelet breaking, consistent with what 
has been previously reported.by others.20
With regard to gap formation of the construct, we 
found that the plastic control anchor had a mean total 
displacement of 19.7 mm which is in keeping with work 
by rossouw et al,19 who demonstrated a mean displace-
ment of 18 mm in a similar model, but with a metal 
anchor rC repair. Furthermore, in a complete human 
cadaveric rC repair model, a standard single-row metal 
anchor repair demonstrated up to 7.64 mm (standard 
deviation 3.74) gap formation after 200 cycles, suggest-
ing the value attained for a simple one-anchor placement 
is accurate.21
although translation to clinical performance should 
be managed cautiously, displacement is considered a 
surrogate for in vivo gap formation post-implant and this 
could indicate greater instability in the post-operative 
patient rehabilitation process compared with traditional 
anchors. our study showed greater than previously 
reported gap formation, and this is likely to be due to the 
specific experimental set up, though it should be noted 
that the consistency of the construct design and experi-
mental procedures facilitated comparisons of gap forma-
tion in implants tested.
reported displacement in our paper, as in previous 
studies, is not constrained to movement of the anchor 
underneath the cortex, but of the whole construct, 
including the suture material, slippage in the suture grip, 
and the movement of the bone within the platform 
(although this was minimal).9 of these, the greatest 
potential source for artefact came from the suture mate-
rial itself. Hurwit et al22 showed variation within uHMWPe 
suture material mechanical properties. The group found 
that by studying initial extension and creep (static and 
dynamic) as surrogates for initial and time-dependent 
gap formation, in addition to other mechanical parame-
ters such as stiffness of the sutures, more appropriate 
determinants of suture performance could be meas-
ured.22 a mean of up to 4.74 mm of initial extension was 
observed in one suture and up to 1.52 mm of extension 
was observed during static creep in varying uHMWPe 
sutures. In another study, an in vivo canine model devel-
oped by Pfeiffer et al9 compared all-suture with tradi-
tional anchors and their findings corroborated with those 
of this study, reporting that all-suture anchors undergo 
greater displacement during cyclical loading at ultimate 
load (mean 13.7 mm versus 3.2 mm).
We argue that displacement as measured within 
 
the whole system is a relevant measure because it is 
representative of gap formation, which is observed in 
the tissue-anchor construct in vivo, despite the fact 
that the displacement value does not solely reflect 
subcortical displacement.
There are limitations to this study. It was performed on 
cadaveric human humeral heads and was not representa-
tive of in vivo conditions with regard to temperature and 
the proximal suture-tendon interface. Intra- and inter-
donor variation was not determined by bone density, 
although reasonable attempts, such as utilising a variety 
of laterality of humeral heads of different aged cadavers 
in combination with separate anchor brands to ensure 
matched sample distributions, to control for this were 
employed.
variation in number of uHMWPe sutures could affect 
the tensile strength of suture anchors, and not all anchors 
contained the same number of sutures. This limitation of 
the methodology is somewhat imposed by variations in 
product design. Furthermore, variations in suture braid-
ing could also affect the tensile strength of anchors, how-
ever, with the majority of all-suture anchors failing by 
anchor pull-out rather than suture failure (95%), this limi-
tation has minimal influence on the results obtained.
The methodology employed for this study aimed to 
take the most relevant aspects of previous studies, high-
lighted by the cyclical loading regime. unlike previous 
studies which applied load in line with angle of insertion 
of the anchor, this study aimed to replicate the direction 
of force of the rC, which is applied in vivo. However, a 
unidirectional tensile force through multiple sutures 
remains incompletely representative of multi-suture cuff 
repairs in which sutures exert multidirectional tension on 
the anchor. as a result, findings from this study cannot 
be directly compared with other work, especially where 
direct axial loading was performed.
although this test is not wholly representative of 
implant performance, the findings can guide clinicians 
as to implant choice with regard to the mechanical 
properties of all-suture anchors. The number of anchors 
tested was consistent with previous work and ade-
quate to determine statistically significant variance; 
however, a strict left/right pair-wise analysis could not 
be conducted.7,9,18,20
Future work should involve representative repair mod-
els comparing all types of all-suture anchors, and add evi-
dence to the suggestion that there are differences 
between all-suture and traditional anchors. It could be 
shown that all currently marketed anchors produce an 
acceptable amount of strength in repair to withstand 
forces required in the post-operative period (there is cur-
rently no published literature on the minimum strength 
of fixation required for appropriate repair),6 although fail-
ure is typically by cheese-wiring or gap formation in the 
longer term.
In the context of traditional anchors, early post- 
operative 
anchor movement is a relatively rare complication, reported

Mechanical properties of all-suture anchors for rotator cuff repair
Bone & Joint research
as 0.1% in one study.23 as there has been greater sug-
gested displacement in all-suture anchors in this and 
other studies, there is cause to consider large-scale fol-
low-up studies of patients with all-suture anchors, espe-
cially in the immediate post-operative period.
In conclusion, this study showed that failure load, 
total displacement, and failure mechanism vary signifi-
cantly between some all-suture anchors used for rC tear 
repair. all-suture anchors were found to have lower fail-
ure loads compared with a commonly used, traditional 
anchor. as anchors were not tested in a representative 
repair model, it is not possible to directly translate find-
ings to a clinical setting. However, intrinsic comparisons 
in this work give further information to the surgeon as 
they consider which is the most appropriate implant for 
a rotator cuff repair procedure in addition to factors such 
as volume of bone stock removed, likely activity levels of 
the patient and probability of revision.
