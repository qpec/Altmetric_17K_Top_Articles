In Brief
Previously, the only known triggers of
apical dendritic spikes were ‘‘bottom-up’’
events, such as appropriate sensory
stimuli or an animal’s location in space.
Lacefield et al. show that reinforced
associations are powerful triggers of
apical dendrite activity and that reward
can manipulate perceptions at their
earliest stages of cortical processing.

SUMMARY
The mammalian brain can form associations be-
tween behaviorally relevant stimuli in an animal’s
environment. While such learning is thought to pri-
marily involve high-order association cortex, even
primary sensory areas receive long-range connec-
tions carrying information that could contribute to
high-level representations. Here, we imaged layer 1
apical dendrites in the barrel cortex of mice perform-
ing a whisker-based operant behavior. In addition to
sensory-motor events, calcium signals in apical den-
drites of layers 2/3 and 5 neurons and in layer 2/3
somata track the delivery of rewards, both choice
related and randomly administered. Reward-related
tuft-wide dendritic spikes emerge gradually with
training and are task specific. Learning recruits cells
whose intrinsic activity coincides with the time of
reinforcement. Layer 4 largely lacked reward-related
signals, suggesting a source other than the primary
thalamus. Our results demonstrate that a sensory
cortex can acquire a set of associations outside its
immediate sensory modality and linked to salient
behavioral events.
INTRODUCTION
Apical dendrites are a common feature of pyramidal neurons
throughout the mammalian neocortex, suggesting a general
function in cortical computation. Pyramidal neurons in cortical
layers 2/3 and 5 send apical dendrites to the surface of the
cortex, where they arborize in layer 1. Layer 1 is composed
almost entirely of these apical dendrites and axons from both
local and distant sources. Being devoid of somata except
for a sparse population of inhibitory cells, layer 1 has been
largely inaccessible by electrophysiology during behavior.
Consequently, the role of apical dendrites in cortical processing
remains mysterious.
In the whisker representation of rodent primary somatosen-
sory cortex (‘‘barrel cortex’’), long-range axons from diverse
areas, including motor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex,
and secondary somatosensory thalamus, synapse extensively
onto these apical tufts (Petreanu et al., 2009; Wimmer et al.,
2010), potentially modulating sensory processing in this region.
Distal synapses onto tufts can engage potent active conduc-
tances that generate dendritic calcium spikes, which can boost
the response of a pyramidal cell to ascending sensory input
onto its basal dendrites, as well as potentiate synaptic connec-
tions onto the tuft (Cichon and Gan, 2015; Gambino et al.,
2014; Larkum, 2013; Waters et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2012). The api-
cal tuft may therefore be a key site for learning associations
among multiple sensory and behavioral representations in the
brain.
The only previously identified triggers of global apical tuft
dendritic spikes are the same events that drive strong somatic
spiking. Sensory stimuli are effective triggers of apical den-
drites in primary sensory cortex, limb movement in the case
of primary motor cortex, and location within an environment
in the case of the hippocampus (Cichon and Gan, 2015; Mur-
ayama et al., 2009; Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015; Xu et al.,
2012). Here, we demonstrate that learned associations rein-
forced by reward can become potent additional drivers of api-
cal dendrite activity, suggesting that apical dendrites could
be a major conduit for assimilating disparate non-modality-
specific, contextual information into a sensory representation.
We recorded calcium signals in apical dendrites and somata
of cortical neurons using 2-photon imaging of sensors genet-
ically targeted to specific layers of the barrel cortex while mice
performed a tactile detection task. Reward-related signals
were prominent in the apicals of layers 2/3 and 5 pyramidal
neurons within layer 1 but not in the somata of layer 4 neu-
rons, indicative of a non-afferent origin. These reward-rein-
forced associations emerged with learning and were task spe-
cific, in that such signals in the barrel cortex required training
on a whisker-based task. Our results suggest that modality-
specific reinforcement recruits layer 1 apical dendrites of pri-
mary sensory cortex into new representations that extend
beyond their normal repertoire of environmental sensory
stimuli.

 RESULTS
To examine the activity of apical dendrites within layer 1 during
behavior, we first combined a transgenic mouse line expressing
Cre recombinase specifically in layer 5 pyramidal neurons
(Rbp4-Cre) with viral expression of the genetically encoded
calcium indicator GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013). This technique
labeled �45% of layer 5 neurons (37/82 GCaMP6f+/NeuN+
cells), including their apical tuft dendrites in layer 1, without
expression in the pyramidal cells of other layers (Figure 1A).
This population includes diverse subtypes of layer 5 pyramidal
neurons, including corticocortical and corticofugal cells (Gerfen
et al., 2013). Water-restricted mice were trained on a head-
fixed whisker-based pole detection task (Figure 1B). Mice were
required to release a lever, when presented with a pole, to obtain
a water reward (pole/‘‘Go’’ trials) and withhold responses when
the pole moved in the opposite direction and beyond the reach
of the animal’s whiskers (catch/‘‘NoGo’’ trials), which addition-
ally controls for auditory stimuli. After mapping the somatotopy
of the barrel cortex by intrinsic signal imaging (Figure 1C), we
used 2-photon microscopy during the behavior to monitor the
calcium activity in numerous single apical tuft dendrites in
cortical locations corresponding to whiskers contacting the
pole (Figure 1D). We observed calcium events in the dendritic
structures of substantial spatial extent, consistent with global,
tuft-wide voltage-gated calcium spikes rather than localized
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated spikes. These
calcium events could additionally reflect backpropagating so-
matic action potentials.
We first averaged fluorescence over the imaged region to
assess overall population activity in apical tufts of layer 5 pyrami-
dal neurons (44 sessions in 4 mice). Within a behavioral session,
single-trial fluorescence showed a prominent short-latency peak
(950 ± 37 ms after trial start, 580 ± 42 ms after first whisker con-
tact) immediately following the presentation of the pole (Fig-
ure 1E), which previous studies have demonstrated is due to
active contacts of the whisker against the pole (Manita et al.,
2015; Xu et al., 2012). We also noticed a second peak at a longer
latency, both in single correct Go trials and the group averages
(Figures 1F, blue, and S1). Neither peak was present in correct
NoGo trials, in which the pole was absent (Figure 1F, red).
Neurons in the primary visual cortex are sensitive to reward
timing (Shuler and Bear, 2006), and we suspected that the
long-latency peaks in apical tufts may be driven by behavioral
feedback, such as rewards. Randomly varying the delay
between correct responses to Go trials and water reward
administration by 0, 250, or 500 ms shifted the second peak
correspondingly, whereas the initial short-latency peak was
invariant (single session in Figure 1G, group average in Fig-
ure 1H). Seventy-five percent of sessions (33/44) exhibited a
discernible second peak, but noise and variability may have
masked second peaks in the other sessions. Therefore, we
analyzed sessions by calculating second peak latencies for
each reward delay within each session. Second peak latency
followed the reward delay times (Figure 2A). We regressed sec-
ond peak latency against reward delay, which was significantly
related across all of the sessions (p < 10�4, n = 33 sessions in
4 mice).
To further examine the effects of reward on apical dendritic ac-
tivity in the absence of active contacts, we randomly adminis-
tered water rewards during a small percentage of the inter-trial
intervals (ITIs). Unexpected random rewards during inter-trial
intervals elicited a calcium influx of qualitatively similar timing
and amplitude to the long-latency peak during trials (Figure 2B).
These data indicate that rewards can influence the activity of
apical tufts in the primary sensory cortex in diverse behavioral
epochs. In addition, dendritic activity during this ITI period
when the pole is absent indicates that these calcium events
can occur independently of whisker contacts.
Apical activity during rewards could result from motor inputs
into layer 1 (Petreanu et al., 2012). Reward consumption inher-
ently involves licking, but isolated spontaneous licking bouts
during inter-trial intervals in the absence of water did not in-
crease calcium to the level seen with random rewards (Figure 2C;
p < 0.001, n = 44 sessions from 4 mice). Another possibility is that
reward delivery could arouse a mouse and induce additional
whisking. Whisking did not appear to consistently drive calcium
influx (Figure S2), but a detailed analysis revealed a weak corre-
lation of whisking and calcium (Figure S3). This correlation, how-
ever, fell to nearly 0 in those epochs in which rewards were
administered (Figures S3B and S3D). As with licking, calcium
responses to the onset of isolated whisking bouts differed mark-
edly from responses to unexpected isolated rewards in the same
sessions (Figure 2D; p = 0.0193, n = 6 sessions from 2 mice),
suggesting that motor input cannot explain our results.
Before they were trained on pole detection, the mice were pre-
trained for 1 week to press a lever for a water reward while freely
moving and then for 2 to 3 additional weeks while head fixed.
Mice were imaged during the last 2 days of head-fixed pre-
training and were therefore highly habituated at the time of imag-
ing. Water rewards given to mice that were proficient at the
lever-pressing task did not elicit dendritic calcium (Figure 2E),
in contrast to random rewards given during the detection task
(p = 0.0035, n = 11 lever-task sessions from 3 of the 4 mice
used in the 44 detection task sessions). This difference in cal-
cium influx cannot be explained by a difference in licking, as
both tasks cause licking to begin to increase 300–400 ms after
the lever response and to peak at �5.5 licks per second at
�1 s after the response. Again, long-latency dendritic activity
cannot be explained by reward-triggering simple motor patterns,
such as licking and swallowing, or sensations, such as tactile
and gustatory stimulation of the tongue. In addition, this result
indicates that reward-associated activity in apical dendrites
does not reflect a global reward signal but rather task specificity,
such that the behavior must engage the specific cortical region
in question. Dendritic responses to isolated rewards during
the pole detection task slowly increased during learning (Fig-
ure 2F; linear regression, p = 0.0055, n = 4 animals). Similarly,
the long-latency peak during task trials grew with training
(Figure S4). These results point to the emergence of a learned
association between whisker-related neural activity and synaptic
inputs linked to reward receipt.
Since average responses to trial and random rewards are
similar in amplitude, they could represent the activity of a single
population of reward-sensitive dendrites or, alternatively, activity
in distinct populations. To assess the activity of individual apical

must lift its paw from the lever to indicate the
presence of the pole (Go trials) or withhold lever
lifting for the 3-s duration of the trial (NoGo trials).
Correct Go responses are rewarded with a drop of
water and a 3-s drinking period, while incorrect

 dendrites activated at distinct times during the task, we
segmented movies using a sparse non-negative matrix factor-
ization method that forms an overlapping clustering of pixels
according to their temporal covariance (Pnevmatikakis et al.,
2016). Thus, while pixels within a factor (segmented dendrite)
necessarily have correlated activity, different factors (different
segmented dendrites) may be active at different times. This
method yielded 18–72 (mean of 38) putative single dendritic
arbors for each movie. Some dendrites were active selectively
during trials (Figure 3A, bottom) while others were active during
inter-trial intervals and silent during trials (Figure 3A, top). Individ-
ual segmented dendrites were substantial in their spatial extent
(>100 mm), which is consistent with global voltage-gated calcium
spikes and backpropagating action potentials.
As a population, individual dendritic arbors had peak activity
times that tiled both pre-trial and trial epochs (Figure 3B;
n = 22 sessions in 3 Rbp4 mice). We observed a wide continuum
of dendrites preferentially active in the pre-trial versus trial
epochs (Figure 3C). A subset of dendrites (48/530, 9% of total)
were activated by random rewards during inter-trial intervals
(Figure 3C, red), and these were more likely to be the dendrites
that were suppressed during the trial (25/167 versus 23/363,
p < 0.001; Figures 3C and 3D). In contrast, dendrites with

enhanced activity during trial epochs
were more likely to track reward timing,
as in Figures 1G and 1H (Figures 3C
and 3D, green; 52/363 versus 11/167,
p = 0.01). Furthermore, reward-tracking dendrites tended to
respond to the initial contact of the whiskers against the pole
(Figure 3E), unlike random reward-selective dendrites (Figures
3F and 3H). The large subset of dendrites that were not reward
selective appeared to have contact activity like reward-tracking
dendrites (Figure 3G). None of these subsets of dendrites ex-
hibited strong lick modulation (Figure 3I). Thus, the effects of
reward within trials and unanticipated rewards on the population
of apical dendrites in the barrel cortex (Figures 1 and 2) are not
found in every neuron, but in fact reflect different subsets of cells.
Furthermore, these subsets of cells are natively active during the
behavioral epoch in which the reward is given.
Like layer 5 cells, layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons also extend
their apical dendrites into layer 1. To examine whether reward
similarly influenced layer 2/3 neurons, we used another trans-
genic mouse line to selectively express GCaMP6f in this layer
(Cux2-Cre; Figure 4A, center). We imaged calcium activity in
the somata of both neurons in layer 2/3 (left) and their apical
dendrite tufts in layer 1 (right) in the same mice in paired ses-
sions on the same day. Similar to layer 5 apical dendrites,
average calcium signals in the apical tufts of layer 2/3 neurons
exhibited a 2-peak structure (Figure 4B, blue), indicating that
reward-associated dendritic activity is not unique to layer 5

 and the relative magnitudes of these transients were similar to
long-latency peaks during trials.
Excitatory layer 4 cells (labeled byNr5a1-Cre), whichlack apical
dendrites reaching layer 1, showed average activity only during
the initial whisker contact period, at a time corresponding to the
first peak in the layer 2/3 and layer 5 responses (Figures 4D and
4E). Similarly, unexpected isolated rewards did not increase cal-
cium activity in layer 4 (Figure 4F). Analysis of individual somata
and dendrites showed that most layer 4 somata respond more
strongly to contacts than trial rewards (Figure 5, left). However,
a subset of layer 4 somata exhibited trial reward period activity,
albeit more weakly and in smaller number than for contacts,
possibly reflecting signals entering from pyramidal cell layers
onto the short layer 4 star pyramid apicals, potential misclassifica-
tion of some deep layer 2/3 cells as layer 4 when using this trans-
genicline,and/orpossibleexaggerationofthesecondpeakbyour
segmentation method (non-negative matrix factorization), which
can underestimate strong negativity, like that in Figure 4E.
Activity in individual layer 2/3 apical dendrites and somata (Fig-
ure 5, center and right) was consistent with populationsignals (Fig-
ure 4). Reward periods engender progressively stronger activity
relative to contacts in individual layer 2/3 somata (Figure 5,
center), then layer 2/3 dendrites (right), and finally layer 5 dendrites
(Figure 3B). Moreover, any reward period activity in layer 4 somata
followedratherthanprecededrewardperiodactivityinlayer5den-
drites and layer 2/3 somata and dendrites (Figure 5). Thus, the
long-latency reward-associated peak is unlikely to be explained
bysensoryafference(whiskercontactsignals)transmitted through
layer 4 and suggests another pathway, potentially involving apical
dendrites, where the signals are more pronounced.

DISCUSSION
Using mouse transgenic lines to target
calcium indicators to specific layers, we
demonstrated
that
apical
dendrites
can incorporate non-modality-specific in-
formation into sensory representations.
For mice experienced at an operant
whisker-based task, an event involving
no immediate whisker contact whatso-
ever (delivery of a reward water droplet)
elicited pronounced long-latency den-
dritic spiking (and somatic output) in the
barrel cortex. In retrospect, such a sec-
ondary peak is visible in previous imaging of layer 5 apical den-
drites during a similar task (Xu et al., 2012). Our stochastic
manipulation of reward administration allowed us to dissociate
the coupling of sensory input, response, and reinforcement
and reveals a unique relationship of rewarded events to apical
activity.
Any of the many areas synapsing on apical dendrites of barrel
cortex neurons—for example, motor cortex, secondary somato-
sensory cortex, secondary somatosensory thalamus (POm)—
could be a trigger for these apical dendritic events. Even the
apical dendrites that were not locked to an obvious behavioral
event (e.g., whisker contact, lever press, reward) appeared to
have a preferred time of activity within or around a trial (Figure 3),
perhaps reflecting phasic locking to the activity of an ensemble
elsewhere in the brain. These ensembles may therefore encode
information other than whisker contacts, such as other sensory
modalities or internal knowledge (e.g., motor efference copy,
task structure, expectations, object identity) that may be impor-
tant in predictive coding and appropriate responses with respect
to modality-specific sensory input for salient stimuli. Potentiation
of these synapses through reinforcement may solidify their ability
to elicit a global dendritic spike, thereby simultaneously altering
somatic spiking in the barrel cortex and the synapse’s potential
for future plasticity. Additional studies are needed to investigate
the degree to which apical recruitment may also reflect the
enhanced generation and backpropagation of somatic spikes.
Although dopamine is often implicated in reinforcement effects
on neural circuits, dopaminergic terminals are relatively sparse in
primary sensory areas. Neurons in rodent primary visual cortex,
however, have been found to be sensitive to reward timing during
2006

 operant tasks, an effect that is mediated by a cholinergic-depen-
dent mechanism (Chubykin et al., 2013; Shuler and Bear, 2006).
Acetylcholine disinhibits apical dendrites by suppressing partic-
ular subpopulations of layer 1 interneurons (Brombas et al.,
2014). Furthermore, similar layer 1 interneurons in auditory and
prefrontal cortices, as well as cholinergic basal forebrain neu-
rons, are activated by whisking, rewards, and punishments, lead-
ing to the inhibition of apical dendrite-targeting interneurons (Eg-
germann et al., 2014; Hangya et al., 2015; Letzkus et al., 2011; Pi
et al., 2013). Thus, salient events such as behavioral reinforce-
ment during active sensing could lead to the disinhibition of apical
dendrites, which may promote the generation of tuft calcium
spikes when they coincide with apical synaptic inputs. This sug-
gests that cortical pyramidal neurons with dendrites in layer 1
could learn new associations through the plasticity of apical
inputs, which is modulated by the cholinergic disinhibition of api-
cal dendrites. Norepinephrine is another important candidate
needing further study in this context (Labarrera et al., 2018).
In the motor cortex, reward is able to potentiate the somatic
discharges of weakly active cells when paired with the firing of
the cell (Hira et al., 2014). Similarly, our findings that dendrites
active during inter-trial intervals are preferentially triggered by
unexpected isolated rewards and that dendrites active during tri-
als track reward timing suggest a mechanism by which subsets
of cells could come to be recruited into ensembles encoding
temporally specific contextual information through reinforce-
ment. Learning has been shown to enhance the responses of vi-
sual cortex neurons to non-sensory factors such as task
outcome, in addition to sensory features such as stimulus orien-
tation (Poort et al., 2015). Recent imaging work in the auditory
system has concluded that the cholinergic modulation of inhibi-
tion may play a role in the processing of contextual information
(Kuchibhotla et al., 2017).
Our method for segmenting individual dendrites based on
spatiotemporal covariance (Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016) does not
discount the possibility that two putative dendritic trees belong
to the same neuron. In addition, it is possible that some putative
dendritic trees are in fact two highly synchronized neurons. Even
if this were true, our study demonstrates phenomena related to
reward-learned associations in a primary sensory cortex and a
higher level of neuronal specificity than expected from a purely
global neuromodulatory signal. Further studies are needed to
assess the degree to which learned responses to unexpected re-
wards and trial-related rewards are cell type specific versus
branch specific.
Our study suggests that salient behavioral events, such
as rewards, can modify the occurrence of apical tuft spikes, pre-
sumably through the plasticity of long-range connections
encoding context. This could afford a powerful generalized
mechanism for encoding task-relevant information to any given
cortical area, including associations with multiple sensory mo-
dalities and motor behaviors, as well as predictions about up-
coming inputs.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
To label specific cortical layers, we utilized several mouse transgenic Cre lines: Rbp4-Cre (GENSAT), Cux2-Cre (Franco et al., 2012)
(MMRC), and Nr5a1-Cre (Jackson Laboratories). All mice were > 8 wks old and bred as F1 hybrids on a C57B6/129svev background.
Both male and females were used. Animals were group housed without enrichment. All procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care & Use Committee at Columbia University.
METHOD DETAILS
Behavior
Behavioral experiments were performed with the Arduino-based OpenMaze open-source behavioral system, whose designs are fully
described at www.openmaze.org. Prior to training on the tactile detection task, mice were trained to press a lever for a water reward
for one week prior to headpost implantation and > 1 week while head-fixed. Lever-trained mice were then either injected with virus
(below) or trained to a criterion of 70% correct responses on the tactile detection task before injection. Two weeks after injection,
animals were implanted with a chronic cranial window and imaged during the detection task.
The tactile detection task requires that the mouse hold a lever down for > 1 s to initiate a trial, in which a stepper motor moved a
small pole (2.15-mm diameter, �3-4-cm long wooden applicator stick), which started from a position 3-4 cm below the animal. The
stepper motor rotated the pole to �2 mm anterior of the nose and �10 mm lateral of the nose (pole/Go trials) or in the opposite
direction even further away from the whiskers (catch/NoGo trials). Whiskers were not hit passively by the pole during stimulus move-
ment, except in a minority (a few percent) of trials where mice whisked or held their whiskers in a protracted position during pole
presentation. Typically, mice initiated whisking after they heard the motor begin to move at the start of the trial. During each trial,
the mouse had to lift its paw from the lever within 3 s to indicate the presence of the pole, or keep the lever depressed if the pole
was absent. Correct pole/Go trials (‘‘Hits’’) were rewarded with a small droplet of water (�8 ml) from a water port, whereas incorrect
lever lifts during the catch/NoGo trials (‘‘false alarms’’) were punished by an 8-10 s timeout before another trial could be initiated as
well as a white noise sound. Imaging during the detection task was from animals that had achieved > 70% correct responses during a
previous session. Animals performed 100-200 trials during a behavioral session, which typically lasted 20-30 minutes.
Licks were detected with a capacitance-based touch sensor (Sparkfun). Whisking was monitored with a high-speed imaging
camera (at 300 fps with a PhotonFocus CCD camera or at 187 fps with Sony PS3eye camera) and automatically measured offline
using published software (Clack et al., 2012). For experiments aimed at dissecting the effect of reward on apical tuft dendrites,

 random rewards were given during the inter-trial interval with 2%–5% probability, and pole/Go trial reward administrations were
delayed by 0, 250, or 500 ms randomly each trial (0, 250 ms for Cux2-Cre mice).
The overall reward rate, which varied across sessions and mice, was approximately 5-10 rewards/min for the pole task and 10-15
rewards/min for the lever task.
Surgery
Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and implanted with a light-weight stainless steel headpost embedded in dental acrylic
affixed to the mouse’s skull after application of a thin layer of Vetbond (3M). Mice recovered for one week before habituation to
head fixation. For virus injections, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected with adeno-associated virus (serotypes 1
or 9) encoding the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6f in a Cre recombinase-specific manner. The human synapsin promoter
(AAV-hSyn-FLEX-GCaMP6f; Penn Vector Core, GECI consortium) was used for Rbp4 and Cux2 lines, and the CAG promoter for
the Nr5a1 line (titers �2x1013 cfu/mL). 100 nL of virus was injected at 1:2-8 dilution in ACSF using a pulled pipette (20-30 mm ID)
at a depth appropriate for the cortical layer of interest (L5: 800 mm, L2/3: 200 mm, L4: 500 mm), 1.6 mm posterior to bregma and
3.2 mm lateral of the midline. Two-photon imaging was performed �2 weeks after viral infection. For cranial window implantation
(a few days prior to imaging), animals were injected with dexamethasone 1 h prior to surgery, at which time they were anesthetized
with isoflurane. A 3-mm hole was drilled in the skull overlying the barrel cortex, and the dura removed from the region of the
craniotomy. A 3-mm glass coverslip was inserted into the craniotomy and cemented into place with Vetbond.
Imaging
Cortical regions corresponding to particular whiskers were identified using intrinsic optical signal imaging. Single whiskers in isoflur-
ane anesthetized mice were stimulated at 5 Hz using a piezoelectric bimorph while recording the reflectance of 700-nm incandescent
light with a Rolera CCD camera (QImaging) using software custom-written in Labview (National Instruments).
Two-photon imaging was performed using a Sutter movable objective microscope under the control of the ScanImage software
package (V. Iyer, Janelia Farms). Scanning was performed at 4 fps using a Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent), tuned to 940 nm, and
focused through a 16x/0.8NA water immersion lens (Nikon). Emitted light was collected with an HQ535/50 filter (Chroma) and GaAsP
photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu). Images were acquired at a resolution of 128 3 128 or 256 3 256 pixels. Apical tuft dendrites
in layer 1 were imaged at depths of 40-80 mm from the pial surface, and Layer 2/3 and 4 somata were imaged at 200-300 mm and
400-600 mm, respectively.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Movies were motion corrected using the SIMA image processing package (Kaifosh et al., 2014). Spatial and temporal components for
individual dendrites were extracted using large-scale sparse non-negative matrix factorization (Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016). This
method inherently corrects for background signal. Data were analyzed using custom-written routines implemented in MATLAB.
Comparisons of frame-averaged calcium signals were performed based upon the average peak amplitude from each session for
the time period of 2 s following each behavioral event type. Whisker angle was computed over 150-ms windows and isolated whisk-
ing bouts were classified as whisker angle change greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean, with a 1 s lockout. Random
reward responsive dendrites were determined based upon proportions of calcium events following random inter-trial interval rewards
versus calcium events during inter-trial intervals without random rewards. Dendrites were categorized as reward tracking if the slope
of the latency of the second peak in calcium response after the lever lift was significantly related to reward delay time (linear regres-
sion). Proportions were compared using a normal approximation to a binomial distribution, and means were compared using t tests.
