Abstract: 
Objective: To examine the effect of maternal gestational weight gain 
(GWG) on adult offspring mortality and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
morbidity.  
Methods: The Aberdeen Children of the 1950s is a population-based cohort 
of adults born in Aberdeen, Scotland between 1950 and 1956. GWG of the 
mothers of cohort members was extracted from original birth records and 
linked to data on offspring morbidity and mortality up to 2011 obtained 
from Scottish national records. Hazard ratios for cardiovascular events and 
mortality in offspring according to maternal weight gain in pregnancy were 
estimated adjusting for maternal and offspring confounders using a 
restricted cubic spline model.  
Results: After exclusions, 3781 members of the original ACONF cohort 
were analysed. Of these, 103 (2.7%) had died, 169 (4.5%) had suffered at 
least one cardiovascular event and 73(1.9%) had had a hospital admission 
for cerebrovascular disease.  Maternal weight gain of 1 kg/ week or more 
was associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular event in the offspring 
{adjusted HR 2.70 (95% CI 1.19 to 6.12)}. There was no association seen 
between GWG and offspring all-cause mortality or cardiovascular 
event.  Adult offspring characteristics (smoking, BMI and diabetes) were 
strongly associated with each outcome.    
Conclusion: Maternal gestational weight gain above 0.9 kg/ week may 
increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease in the adult offspring, but not 
all cause mortality or cardiovascular disease. Health and lifestyle factors

such as smoking, BMI and diabetes in the adult offspring had a stronger 
influence than maternal and birth characteristics on their mortality and 
morbidity.

the adult offspring had a stronger influence than maternal and birth characteristics on 
their mortality and morbidity. 
Key words: pregnancy, gestational weight gain, cardiovascular disease, mortality 
Word count 250 
Key Messages: 
What is already known: 
Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and total gestational weight gain has been shown to affect 
cardiovascular parameters such as blood pressure in the young adult offspring. None of the 
published studies had adequate follow up time to assess the effects on cardiovascular events 
and mortality. 
What this paper adds: 
In a cohort follow up study spanning 60 years, rate of gestational weight gain (GWG) was not 
found to be associated with offspring’s risk of mortality or cardiovascular events. GWG of 
0.9Kg/week or more was associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular events in the 
offspring. Adult health and lifestyle factors such as smoking, diabetes and obesity were strongly 
associated with offspring’s risk of mortality and morbidity. 
How might this impact on clinical practice? 
For the first time, this large scale cohort study was able to show that adult health and lifestyle 
factors and not early life risk factors played the most important role in determining 
cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Modifying these risk factors (obesity, smoking, diabetes) 
would constitute effective preventive strategy irrespective of early life risk factors.

Introduction 
Excessive weight has established health risks for both the mother and baby not only 
during pregnancy1, but also in the longer term, including premature mortality2,3. 
Proposed mechanisms for this long-term risk include genetic predisposition, shared 
environment and fetal programming of adult disease4. 
The effect of maternal weight gain during pregnancy (gestational weight gain or GWG) 
on adult offspring health is less clear. Many of the cohorts designed to study the effects 
of maternal nutrition in pregnancy on offspring health are currently relatively young and 
therefore can only report adverse outcomes at the time of birth, childhood or young 
adulthood. Most of these have focussed on offspring BMI, with high correlations found 
with maternal GWG.  Morrison et al5 found that maternal GWG was positively 
associated with insulin levels and birthweight, length and body fat in the newborn. The 
Jerusalem Perinatal Family Follow-up Study found that the offspring of mothers within 
the upper pre-pregnancy BMI quartile (BMI> 26.4 kg/m2) had a higher BMI, and 
cardiometabolic traits compared to those born to mothers in the lower quartile (BMI< 
21.0 kg/m2) at 32 years of age6. These associations were independent of maternal GWG 
and other confounders.  
Record linkage of a mature cohort – Aberdeen Children of the Nineteen Fifties (ACONF) 
to local obstetric and national vital statistics and hospital clinical datasets available in 
Scotland, enabled us to test the hypothesis that maternal GWG is associated with 
subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and premature mortality in the adult offspring,

independent of any effects of high maternal BMI early in pregnancy and offspring 
characteristics.  
Methods: 
Ethical approval: Ethical approval for the Aberdeen Children of the 1950s study was 
obtained from the North of Scotland Research Ethics Service. Approval to access and link 
relevant data for this analysis were obtained from the Aberdeen Maternity and 
Neonatal Databank steering committee, the steering committee of the Aberdeen 
Children of the 1950s study and the Privacy Advisory Committee of the NHS National 
Services Scotland. 
Data sources: Data were obtained from four sources –  
1. The ACONF study contains data on children born between 1950 and 1956 who 
attended school in Aberdeen city7 and formed the basis of the current investigation. 
The ACONF database contains socio-demographic variables about the children, as 
well as their height and weight measurements taken between 1962 and 1964 as part 
of a school survey. Information about adult height, weight, socio-economic status 
and self- reported history of diabetes was obtained from a questionnaire follow-up 
of the cohort conducted in 2001.  
2. The Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank (AMND) is an obstetric database 
that records all pregnancy related events occurring in Aberdeen since 1950 
(www.abdn.ac.uk/amnd). From this database we obtained pregnancy and delivery

details of the mothers of children in ACONF, including their age at delivery, height 
and ante-natal weights recorded during each antenatal clinic visit.  
3. The Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR) database contains details of all hospital 
admissions and discharges in Scotland since 1981 with the discharge diagnosis coded 
using International Classification of Diseases version 9 (ICD-9) to April 1996 and 
version 10 (ICD-10) thereafter.  
4. The General Register Office provided date and cause of death information for the 
ACONF cohort.   
 Record linkage: The Community Health Index number, a unique identifier attributed to 
all individuals registered with a general practice in Scotland was utilised for 
deterministic linkage. In addition, probabilistic matching using surname, date of birth, 
gender and post code of residence, was utilised in cases where CHI number was missing. 
All linkages were carried out by the Data Management Team of the University of 
Aberdeen and the Information and Services Division of NHS Scotland. After linkage, 
identifying variables were removed to generate a pseudononymised dataset before 
transfer to the researchers for analysis. 
Data cleaning and exclusions:  We excluded ACONF members who did not complete the 
questionnaire survey in 2001, emigrated out of Scotland or did not report one or more 
of the adult characteristics. We also excluded all participants whose mother, did not 
have more than one weight recorded in pregnancy, or who had only 2 weights recorded 
less than 2 weeks apart (figure 1).

Study design: This was a cohort study in which the exposure was maternal GWG 
obtained by subtracting the first from the last recorded antenatal weight and dividing 
the difference by the number of weeks elapsed between the two recordings.  
We considered three outcomes in the offspring: i) all-cause mortality, ii) any 
cardiovascular disease- mainly identified by a hospital admission due to cardiovascular 
disease {(ICD 10 codes I20 – I25), arterial disease (I73 – I74), other cardiovascular 
disease}- as recorded in the SMR database or death from cardiovascular disease without 
any previous hospital admission for this condition, and iii) any hospital admission or 
death for cerebrovascular disease {(ICD 10 codes I60 – I69)}.  
Covariates were adjusted for in a stepwise manner. Maternal level variables (age at 
delivery, maternal early pregnancy BMI calculated from the height and weight recorded 
at the first antenatal clinic visit, social class  according to the Registrar General’s 
Classification of Occupations based social class of the father) were included in the 
adjusted model (model 2).   In model 3, offspring level variables at the time of birth and 
childhood (gender, standardized birth weight score8, childhood BMI Standard Deviation 
Score (SDS) or z-score calculated using the LMS (Lambda- Mu-Sigma) method9 from the 
height and weight recorded as part of the ACONF Reading Survey were included in 
addition to the covariates in model 2. Offspring’s adult social class (based on the 
participant’s employment socioeconomic group)10, adult smoking habits, adult BMI and 
self-reported history of diabetes mellitus, information collected as part of the ACONF

follow up survey in 2001 when participants were aged between  43 and 49 years of age, 
were included in the fourth and final model in addition. 
The underlying time variable for the analysis was the age of the offspring at death, date 
of hospital discharge for the outcomes of interest or end of follow up (31st January 
2012), whichever occurred earliest.  
Statistical analysis: Data were analysed using Stata (StataCorp, Version 13 MP, Texas, 
USA).  Descriptive univariate analyses of the data were done initially. Cox’s proportional 
hazards model was used to assess the relationship between maternal GWG and the pre-
specified health outcomes in their adult offspring. To allow for some children having 
siblings in the dataset, we adjusted for clustering on the mother using multilevel 
modelling. We estimated robust standard errors after adjusting for multiple offspring 
clustered within mothers11 
Rate of GWG was treated as a continuous variable in order not to lose information and 
to model any non-linear relationships. Unadjusted Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the pre-specified outcomes by the rate of weight gain 
(kg/week) were calculated (Model 1), followed by three adjusted models as described 
above.  The proportional hazard assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals12 and 
no violations were detected. To model the non-linear relationship between rate of 
weight gain and offspring outcomes, a restricted cubic spline (RCS) procedure was 
adopted.13,14 This uses multiple polynomial line segments within the range of rate of 
weight gain, the boundaries of which are called knots. Knots were placed at equally

spaced centiles of the distribution of rate of weight gain. In our analyses, five knots were 
considered, placed at the 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 100th percentiles; corresponding 
rates of weight gain  values were 0.01, 0.32, 0.41, 0.50 and 1.35 kg/week respectively. 
The spline function was assumed to be significant if the p-value for the model chi-square 
was less than 5% and the association was assumed to be non-linear if the spline 
coefficients differed significantly from each other on the Wald test for linearity. A rate of 
weight gain of 0.4 kg/week was used as the reference value in these RCS Cox analyses as 
this corresponded to the 50th centile. 
Missing values: Complete case analysis was done for missing data on exposure variables. 
Where data were missing in categorical covariates, a separate category was created for 
missing observations in each of the covariates and included in the relevant analyses. 
Missing in continuous variables was treated as missing in the analysis. 
In the modelling diagnostic, any outliers and influential data points were checked using 
likelihood displacement values and LMAS values15 for the final model. A scatter plot 
between predicted likelihood displacement values and time to event for each of the 
outcomes was used to identify any observations with disproportionate influence.  
Similarly, predicted LMAX was used instead of likelihood displacement measure. Four 
observations appeared to be somewhat influential relative to others. Those four 
observations were excluded and the analyses were repeated for all the outcomes in the 
final model. The estimates of the covariates were almost same as the estimates with the 
observations included in the modelling.

Multiple imputation was carried out using RealcomImpute, a software for multilevel 
multiple imputation. The multilevel multiple imputations were carried out for variables 
with missing observations using complete information on other covariates for all cases 
and outcome.   The results were compared between complete case analysis and 
complete + imputed dataset.   
Results: 
Figure 1 shows cohort follow up with exclusions. After applying all of the exclusion 
criteria described above, there were 3781 members of the original ACONF cohort 
(n=12,151) included in the analysis. Of these, 103 (2.7%) had died, 169 (4.5%) had 
suffered at least one cardiovascular event and 73(1.9%) had had a hospital admission or 
death from cerebrovascular disease.  The major causes of death were neoplasms 
(31.5%), diseases of the circulatory system (26.0%), diseases of the digestive system 
(10.0%), metabolic diseases (8.3%) and injury or trauma (6.2%). 
Table 1 compares the baseline characteristics of those who did and did not experience 
the outcomes of all-cause mortality, or cardiac or cerebrovascular event. Members of 
the ACONF cohort who had died, were more likely to have mothers with a higher BMI 
during pregnancy {mean 23.64 (SD3.64) versus 22.85 (SD 3.12), p=0.01}; higher BMI in 
childhood expressed as SDS {mean 0.67 (0.84) versus 0.47 (0.88), p=0.03}. As adults they 
were more likely to belong to a more deprived socio-economic status group (p for trend

(4.9% versus 1.7%, p<0.01). 
Compared to those who did not have a cardiovascular event, those who did were more 
likely to be male (64.5% versus 47.0%, p<0.01), and as adults belong to a more deprived 
socio-economic status group (p for trend <0.01), currently smoke (47.3% versus 24.1%, 
p<0.01), have a higher BMI (p for trend <0.01) and report diabetes (7.7% versus 1.5%, 
p<0.01).  
Those who had had a cerebrovascular event were more likely to have mothers with a 
higher BMI in pregnancy {mean 23.66 (SD 3.32) Kg/m2 versus 22.86 (SD 3.13) Kg/ m2, 
p=0.03}. As adults, they were more likely to be current smokers (57.5% versus 24.5%, 
p<0.01) and diabetic (8.2% versus 1.6%, p<0.01). 
Of note, rate of maternal GWG was not associated with any of the outcomes of interest 
in the offspring on univariate analysis. 
Figures 2, 3 and 4 show respectively the relationship between maternal GWG and the 
offspring’s risk of all-cause mortality, hospital admission for any cardiovascular disease 
and hospital admission for any cerebrovascular condition, from the fully adjusted model. 
The HRs with 95% CIs for these outcomes at each node of GWG are presented in Table 
2, with results from each model shown separately in a stepwise fashion.

 Neither the unadjusted nor any of the adjusted models showed a statistically significant 
association between maternal GWG and offspring risk of all-cause mortality (Table 2). 
Figure 2 is the visual representation of the fully adjusted HRs with 95% CIs for offspring 
mortality by maternal GWG. According to this figure, there appears to be a reduction in 
offspring mortality risk with increased GWG, although the association was not 
statistically significant. 
Association between GWG and offspring cardiovascular event : 
The adjusted and unadjusted HR with 95% confidence intervals of any hospital 
admission or death from cardiovascular disease in the offspring by maternal GWG are 
presented in table 2. Cardiovascular disease in the offspring did not show  statistically 
significant association with maternal GWG in any of the unadjusted or adjusted models. 
Figure 3 demonstrates the relationship between maternal GWG and hospital admission 
for any cardiovascular event in the offspring adjusted for confounding factors. Although 
not statistically significant, this figure shows a U shaped relationship with higher risk of 
cardiovascular events at both extremes of maternal GWG. 
Association between GWG and offspring  cerebrovascular event: 
Table 2 and figure 4 present the relationship between maternal GWG and offspring risk 
of any cerebrovascular event. As table 2 shows, a weight gain of 1 Kg/ week or more was 
associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular event in the offspring in the 
unadjusted model {HR 3.19 (95% CI 1.43, 7.09)}, the model adjusted for maternal factors 
only {adj. HR 2.83 (95% CI 1.31, 6.12)}, the model adjusted for maternal and offspring’s

birth and childhood level factors {adj. HR 3.55 (95% CI 1.60, 7.92)}, and the fully adjusted 
model  additionally adjusting for  adult offspring level factors {adj.HR 2.70 (95% CI 1.19, 
6.12)}. 
Table3 presents the Hazard Ratios with 95% confidence intervals for each of the 
variables included in the fully adjusted models, which shows that the characteristics of 
offspring as adults are the main drivers of risk of all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular 
and cerebrovascular disease. Being a current smoker when surveyed in 2001 was 
strongly associated with mortality {adj HR 4.10(95% CI 2.50, 6.74)}, cardiovascular 
disease {adj HR 3.32(95% CI 2.29, 4.81)} and cerebrovascular disease {adj HR 5.45(95% 
CI 2.71, 10.93)}. Being diabetic also carried a higher risk of all-cause mortality {adj HR 
2.79(95% CI 1.09, 7.11)}, cardiovascular disease {adj HR 4.05(95% CI 2.23, 7.33)} and 
cerebrovascular disease {adj HR 6.41(95% CI 2.85, 14.42)}. Adult offspring BMI showed 
inconsistent associations with the outcomes of interest – while being underweight was 
associated with mortality {adj HR 4.16(95% CI 1.28, 13.49)}, overweight {adj HR 
1.63(95% CI 1.11, 2.39)} and obesity {adj HR 2.65(95% CI 1.71, 4.11)} were associated 
with increased risk of cardiovascular disease but not cerebrovascular disease. 
In the secondary analysis using dataset with multiple imputations, the results were 
comparable to the analysis with complete cases.  Only for the outcome of 
cerebrovascular disease in the offspring, widening confidence intervals of effect 
estimates with increasing GWG meant there was no longer a statistically significant 
association seen.

Discussion: 
  We did not find a statistically significant relationship between maternal GWG and 
offspring all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events. Being overweight or obese as 
adults conferred a higher risk of cardiovascular events, whereas higher maternal BMI 
during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular but not 
cardiovascular events on univariate analysis. 
A key strength of this study was the well-defined cohort with adequate length of follow 
up to detect outcomes of interest.  Even so the relatively small number of outcomes 
may have limited our power to detect associations that really exist, especially at the 
extremes of maternal GWG.  Another strength of the study was the high quality data 
used for the analysis16. Linkage with ISD and GRO in Scotland by first deterministic 
(where possible) and then probabilistic matching maximised linkages and ensured a high 
proportion of true linkages17. The availability of data at various time points during the 
lifecourse of the offspring allowed the examination of risk factors at the time of delivery, 
offspring’s childhood and middle-age adulthood.  We were able to take account of 
clustering and co-linearity within and between variables by using multilevel modelling. 
The cubic spline analysis enabled us to model the non-linear relationship between GWG 
and offspring morbidity and mortality without losing information through 
categorisation.  
The main limitation of this study is the exclusion of a large proportion of the original 
cohort because of missing information on GWG (mostly due to a single weight being

recorded during pregnancy), or non-response to the ACONF follow up questionnaire.  A 
comparison of cohort members with and without complete information showed that 
they differed in terms of gender, parents’ marital status, social class at birth or in 
childhood but not in maternal GWG18. As the SMR database was only initiated in 1981, 
left truncation of the outcome data will have occurred, although the oldest cohort 
members would have been 31 years old in 1981, an age when cardiovascular risk is low 
and mainly confined to congenital or rheumatic heart diseases.  Fewer women were 
obese in pregnancy in the 1950s, reducing generalisability of the findings to 
contemporary situations.  As with all observational studies, residual confounding from 
unmeasured or poorly measured covariates may have affected our results.   
It is difficult to tease out the effects of genetic predisposition, fetal programming and 
shared environment when studying the effects of maternal GWG on offspring morbidity 
and mortality later in life. Lawlor et al showed that neither maternal nor fetal adiposity-
related genetic variants were associated with higher GWG19. Nevertheless, higher GWG 
signifies higher birth weight which in turn is associated with higher risk of childhood and 
adult obesity.20-24  
Far less is known about the impact of maternal GWG on offspring cardiovascular health.  
Some studies report a modest increase in blood pressure in children25 and young 
adults26-28 associated with high GWG. The synergistic mechanisms and the differences 
between maternal pre-pregnancy weight per se and GWG on the offspring’s 
cardiovascular health warrant further discussion. GWG may be about nutritional content

of the food consumed – particularly those gaining a lot of weight. The availability of 
adipose stores versus available fuel from food is likely to have differing effects on fetal 
growth and ultimately on future health in adulthood. 
There is currently no agreement on whether mothers who are overweight or obese at 
the start of their pregnancy should limit their weight gain. In 2009 the US Institute of 
Medicine recommended that mothers with BMI in the range 25-30 kg/m2should gain 7-
11.5kg over the whole of pregnancy and 0.23-0.33 kg/wk in the second and third 
trimester, with corresponding figures of 5-9kg total gain and 0.17-0.27 kg/wk in the 2nd 
and 3rd trimester in those with a pre-pregnancy BMI of 30 or more29.  In the UK, the 
National Institute of Clinical Excellence concluded in 2010 that maternal weight should 
not be routinely monitored during pregnancy30. Our findings are broadly reassuring 
since maternal GWG per se was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause 
mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in the offspring. In comparison, risk factors 
measured in the offspring as adults had a stronger relationship with the outcomes.  This 
indicates that being healthy as an adult (ie being a non-smoker, having a healthy weight 
and being non-diabetic) is more important than any risks acquired in utero and in 
childhood.  Longer-term follow-up of this cohort to accumulate cardiovascular events 
will allow subgroup analysis of mothers with high pre-pregnancy BMI to contribute to 
the debate on benefits of GWG restriction in overweight and obese women.

Conclusion:  
In this population-based cohort, gestational weight gain of 1 kg/ week or more was 
associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease in the adult offspring, an 
effect independent of maternal and offspring BMI as a child and adult. Maternal GWG 
was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality 
in the adult offspring. Health and lifestyle factors in the adult offspring were the 
strongest determinants of their morbidity and mortality.
