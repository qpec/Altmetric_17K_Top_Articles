  E. coli Infections in Patients with Pyelonephritis
For 2013–2014, we prospectively identified US adults with 
flank pain, temperature >38.0°C, and a diagnosis of acute py-
elonephritis, confirmed by culture. Cultures from 453 (86.9%) 
of 521 patients grew Escherichia coli. Among E. coli isolates 
from 272 patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis and 181 
with complicated pyelonephritis, prevalence of fluoroquinolone 
resistance across study sites was 6.3% (range by site 0.0%–
23.1%) and 19.9% (0.0%–50.0%), respectively; prevalence 
of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production was 
2.6% (0.0%–8.3%) and 12.2% (0.0%–17.2%), respectively. 
Ten (34.5%) of 29 patients with ESBL infection reported no 
exposure to antimicrobial drugs, healthcare, or travel. Of the 
29 patients with ESBL infection and 53 with fluoroquinolone-
resistant infection, 22 (75.9%) and 24 (45.3%), respectively, 
were initially treated with in vitro inactive antimicrobial drugs. 
Prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance exceeds treatment 
guideline thresholds for alternative antimicrobial drug strate-
gies, and community-acquired ESBL-producing E. coli infec-
tion has emerged in some US communities.
E
scherichia coli, the predominant cause of community-
acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) worldwide, is in-
creasingly resistant to available antimicrobial drugs. In the 
United States, in vitro resistance of E. coli to trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) became prevalent in the 
1990s (1). Over the past decade, fluoroquinolone resistance 
rates have increased to >10% in some surveys (2,3).
In many parts of the world, E. coli fluoroquinolone re-
sistance rates are >20% among patients with community-
acquired uncomplicated UTI and >50% among patients 
with complicated infections (4). In addition, infections re-
sulting from extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–pro-
ducing E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae are becoming 
increasingly common in these same areas and are associ-
ated with sequence type (ST) 131, a globally disseminated, 
multidrug-resistant clone that frequently produces CTX-
M-15 ESBL. These E. coli isolates are generally resistant 
to cephalosporins and often to other antimicrobial drug 
classes. In North America, ESBL-producing E. coli infec-
tions have occurred predominantly in patients with health-
care exposure and have not become prevalent as a cause of 
community-acquired infections (5–8).
The 2010 international treatment guidelines of the Infec-
tious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommend for acute 
uncomplicated pyelonephritis a fluoroquinolone and an initial 
dose of an agent from another antimicrobial drug class (e.g., 
ceftriaxone or gentamicin) if the fluoroquinolone resistance 
rate is >10% (9). For uncomplicated cystitis, the guidelines 
discourage use of an antimicrobial drug if its resistance rate 
is >20%. The guidelines do not address a scenario in which 
ESBL-producing uropathogens have become prevalent among 
patients with community-acquired infections. Use of antimi-
crobial drugs for which the uropathogen shows in vitro resis-
tance has been associated with substantially reduced response 
rates (1,10,11), which can lead to serious consequences, par-
ticularly for patients with pyelonephritis. Given rapid changes 
in global resistance patterns and a lack of recent active and 
prospective surveillance of community-acquired UTI in the 
United States, the extent to which the prevalence of fluoroqui-
nolone resistance has increased and multidrug-resistant ESBL-
producing strains have emerged in the community is unknown.
We sought to determine the prevalence of E. coli an-
timicrobial resistance among patients with acute pyelo-
nephritis who sought care at a US emergency department 
(ED)–based sentinel research network. We focused on flu-
oroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing isolates from 
these patients and examined risk factors for antimicrobial 
drug resistance.
Methods
Participants
We recruited adults seeking care in EMERGEncy ID NET, 
a network of 10 university-affiliated urban US EDs (12). 
All 10 study sites (online Technical Appendix, http://ww-
wnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/22/9/16-0148-Techapp1.pdf) pro-
vided institutional review board approval. 
We enrolled patients >18 years of age who sought care 
during July 2013–December 2014 and had flank pain or 
costovertebral tenderness; temperature >38.0°C (100.4°F) 
measured by any method (i.e., oral, rectal, or axillary); and 
a presumptive diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (i.e., pa-
tient received treatment for this infection during ED visit or 
was prescribed treatment at discharge). All sites conducted 
an audit to compare characteristics of enrolled and nonen-
rolled eligible patients to estimate case-finding sensitivity 
and detect enrollment biases (online Technical Appendix). 
Design and Measurements
We conducted a cross-sectional study by using a convenience 
sample of prospectively identified patients. ED physicians or 
study coordinators who used standardized forms at the time 
of care collected the following: demographic characteristics 
(i.e., age, sex, race, ethnicity); symptom duration; urinary 
tract abnormalities; UTI within the previous year; concurrent 
and immunocompromising conditions; antimicrobial drug 
use within the previous 2 and 60 days; a fluoroquinolone- or

ceftriaxone-resistant UTI within the previous 90 days and 1 
year; long-term care residence; hospitalization; travel outside 
North America within the previous 90 days; illness severity; 
disposition; and treatments provided. The study population 
consisted of patients with urine specimens that grew a single 
uropathogen at >104 CFU/mL. We defined a uropathogen as 
an organism known to be associated with UTI; among pos-
sible pathogens, we found E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseu-
domonas, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Salmonella species; 
Staphylococcus aureus or S. saprophyticus; and Enterococcus 
and Aerococcus species. If a urine specimen grew >1 organ-
ism, we considered it to be contaminated and excluded it. We 
also excluded specimens that grew Lactobacillus, non-sapro-
phyticus coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, or Corynebacte-
ria species; or α- or g-hemolytic streptococci. 
Patients’ urine specimens were collected in sterile 
containers by mid-stream clean-catch technique (91.4%), 
urethral catheterization (5.8%), and other techniques (e.g., 
sample from collection bag [2.7%] or suprapubic aspirate 
[0.2%]). Laboratories determined MICs by using automated 
susceptibility testing with VITEK commercial panels (bio-
Mérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) at 7 sites; Microscan (Dade 
Behring, Inc., Sacramento, CA, USA) at 2 sites; and Phoenix 
Instrument System (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, 
USA) at 1 site, according to manufacturer instructions.
Each site used E. coli antimicrobial drug resistance 
breakpoints based on MIC breakpoints (µg/mL) of the 
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (Wayne, PA, 
USA) as follows: ampicillin >32; TMP/SMX >4/76; ce-
fazolin >8; ceftriaxone >4; cefotaxime >4; ciprofloxacin 
>4; levofloxacin >8; ertapenem >2; and imipenem >4 (13). 
We report resistance rates for antimicrobial drugs included 
in the study site laboratories’ standard susceptibility testing 
panel. In 2010, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards In-
stitute changed breakpoints for cephalosporins, aztreonam, 
and carbapenems. We provided Etests (bioMérieux) for 
ceftriaxone and imipenem to sites that had not yet updated 
automated susceptibility testing systems to enable these 
sites to use the new breakpoints. We considered Enterobac-
teriaceae isolates that were nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone 
(i.e., MIC >1 µg/mL) to be potentially ESBL producing 
(13). The sites shipped these isolates to a reference labora-
tory to confirm speciation, ESBL production, and molecu-
lar characterization (online Technical Appendix).
We classified patients as having complicated pyelone-
phritis if they were pregnant or male or had a current or pre-
existing functional or anatomic urinary tract abnormality or 
current immunocompromising condition. Possible preexist-
ing urinary tract abnormalities were history of kidney stones, 
genitourinary procedures within the past 30 days, prostatic pa-
thology, bladder catheter within the past 30 days, neurogenic 
urinary retention, ureteral stricture, duplicated collecting 
system, renal or bladder cancer, renal transplant, ureteral 
diversion, vesico-ureteral reflux, single kidney, and nephros-
tomy tubes. Immunocompromising conditions were diabe-
tes, active cancer, systemic corticosteroid use, current use of 
other immunosuppressants, chronic debilitating condition, 
chronic renal insufficiency or failure, and HIV infection. 
We identified current complicating features on the basis of 
clinical findings or laboratory studies in the ED; possible 
complications were pregnancy, diabetes, bladder catheter, 
ureteral stent, percutaneous nephrostomy tube, prostatitis, 
nephrolithiasis, renal or perirenal abscess, and urinary re-
tention. We recorded history of chronic debilitating illness, 
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart or he-
patic failure, but did not assign such illness as a criterion for 
complicated infection. We classified patients without criteria 
for complicated pyelonephritis as having uncomplicated py-
elonephritis. We defined healthcare-associated infections as 
those in patients hospitalized or residing in a long-term care 
facility within the previous 90 days; other patients were clas-
sified as having community-acquired infections.
Statistical Analysis
To manage the study data, we used REDCap electronic-
data capture tools hosted by the University of California, 
Los Angeles, CA, USA (14). We used SAS Version 9.3 
(Cary, NC, USA) and Microsoft Excel 2013 (Redmond, 
WA, USA) to analyze data and used descriptive statis-
tics to summarize patient characteristics and resistance 
prevalence. We calculated relative risks and 95% CIs to 
determine associations between epidemiologic and clinical 
characteristics and presence or absence of fluoroquinolone-
resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli infections.
Results
Of 817 enrolled patients with acute pyelonephritis, 793 
(97.1%) submitted a urine culture. Of those 793 patients, 
272 (34.3%) were excluded from analysis: 149 (18.8%) 
had no culture growth; 74 (9.3%) grew >1 contaminant; 17 
(2.1%) grew >1 isolate at <104 CFU/mL; 25 (3.2%) grew 
>1 organism at 104 CFU/mL; and 7 (0.9%) had no fever. 
The study population consisted of 521 patients who grew 
1 uropathogen at >104 CFU/mL. The case finding audit re-
vealed a 66% enrollment of eligible patients. Enrolled and 
nonenrolled patients were similar for most characteristics, 
including E. coli susceptibility rates to TMP/SMX, ceftri-
axone, and fluoroquinolones (online Technical Appendix).
Among the 521 study patients, median age was 37 
(range 18–88, interquartile range 26–52) years; 455 (87.3%) 
were female (Table 1). Most (446 [85.6%]) patients had a 
community-acquired infection; 74 (14.2%) had a healthcare-
associated infection (70 with hospitalization and 9 with nurs-
ing home residence in the previous 90 days). A total of 286 
(54.9%) patients had uncomplicated pyelonephritis; 235 
(45.1%) had complicated pyelonephritis.

  E. coli Infections in Patients with Pyelonephritis
Of types of uropathogens in patients with uncompli-
cated and complicated pyelonephritis (Table 2), E. coli ac-
counted for infections in 453 (86.9%) patients; 272 (60.0%) 
of the infections were uncomplicated, and 181 (40.0%) 
were complicated. Among the 286 patients with uncompli-
cated infections, E. coli accounted for 95.1%; among the 
235 patients with complicated infections, E. coli accounted 
for 77.0% (Table 2).
E. coli antimicrobial drug resistance rates among patients 
with complicated pyelonephritis tended to be higher than 
rates for patients with uncomplicated cases, except for TMP/
SMX (Table 3). Among all patients, E. coli resistance rates 
varied by drug: ampicillin, 57.2% (259/453); TMP/SMX, 
36.4% (165/453); gentamicin, 9.9% (43/436); cefazolin, 
 
14.2% (52/367); ceftriaxone, 7.7% (35/453); levofloxacin, 
10.2% (33/325); and ciprofloxacin, 12.1% (48/397). Among

 RESEARCH
53 fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, 8 (15.1%) were sus-
ceptible to ampicillin, 34 (64.2%) to gentamicin, and 27 
(50.9%) to ceftriaxone. Of 46 isolates tested for susceptibil-
ity to cefazolin, 19 (41.3%) were susceptible; all 48 (100%) 
isolates tested were susceptible to a carbapenem. E. coli 
antimicrobial drug resistance rates for patients with uncom-
plicated and complicated pyelonephritis varied by study site 
(online Technical Appendix Tables 2, 3).
Among patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, 17 
(6.3%) of 272 E. coli isolates were resistant to fluoroquino-
lone. The range of prevalence by site was 0.0%–23.1%; for 
2 sites, prevalence was >10% (Figure 1; online Technical 
Appendix Tables 2, 3). Among patients with complicated 
pyelonephritis, 36 (19.9%) of 181 E. coli isolates showed 
fluoroquinolone resistance. The range of prevalence by 
site was 0.0%–50.0%; 8 sites had a prevalence >10%, 4 of 
which had a prevalence >20%. We found fluoroquinolone 
resistance associated with complicated E. coli infection, 
prior use of antimicrobial drugs and fluoroquinolone, hos-
pital admission, and prior UTI resulting from a fluoroqui-
nolone- or ceftriaxone-resistant organism (Table 4).
Among patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, 
ESBL production was found in 7 (2.6%) of 272 E. coli iso-
lates; range by study site was 0.0%–8.3% (Figure 2; online 
Technical Appendix Tables 2, 3). Among patients with 
complicated pyelonephritis, ESBL production was found in 
22 (12.2%) of 181 E. coli isolates; range by site was 0.0%–
17.2% (Figure 2; online Technical Appendix Tables 2, 3). 
Frequencies of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were higher 
among patients with antimicrobial drug resistance risk fac-
tors than among those without these factors (Table 5). Nine-
teen (65.5%) of 29 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli 
infection had a recognized risk factor for antimicrobial drug 
resistance (Figure 2; online Technical Appendix Tables 2, 
3). Sixteen (55.2%) had antimicrobial drug exposure within 
the previous 60 days. During the previous 90 days, 6 (20.7%) 
had healthcare-setting exposure and 4 (13.8%) had travel 
outside North America. We found ESBL-producing E. coli 
infection associated with complicated infection, prior anti-
microbial drug use, travel outside North America, and prior 
UTI resulting from a fluoroquinolone- or ceftriaxone-resis-
tant organism. Among 37 isolates that grew other Entero-
bacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 (2.7%) 
was ESBL producing. Among 29 ESBL-producing E. coli 
isolates, susceptibility rates to other antimicrobial drugs 
were 41.4% to TMP/SMX, 18.5% to ciprofloxacin, 21.7% 
to levofloxacin, 41.4% to gentamicin, and 100% to carbape-
nem. The prevalence of E. coli fluoroquinolone resistance 
correlated with the prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli by 
site (Figure 3). 
We further characterized 26 ESBL-producing E. coli 
isolates and 1 K. pneumoniae isolate. Among E. coli isolates,

PCR identified multiple ESBL types: 22 (84.6%) produced 
CTX-M-15 (16 [61.5%] produced only CTX-M-15; 6 [23.1%] 
produced CTX-M-15 and TEM-1); 2 (7.7%) produced CTX-
M-27; 1 (3.8%) produced CTX-M-14; and 1 (3.8%) produced 
CTX-M-14 and TEM-1. The K. pneumoniae isolate produced 
SHV-1 and CTX-M-15 ESBL types. Sixteen (61.5%) of the 
E. coli isolates were clonal type O25b-ST131.
Among patients with an E. coli infection, 223 (49.2%) 
were discharged from the ED and 229 (50.6%) were admit-
ted to the hospital; of these, 13 (5.8%) and 18 (7.9%), respec-
tively, were treated with an antimicrobial drug that lacked 
in vitro activity against their infection. Of 53 patients with 
a fluoroquinolone-resistant and 29 with an ESBL-producing 
infection, 24 (45.3%) and 22 (75.0%), respectively, were 
initially treated with in vitro–inactive antimicrobial drugs. 
Among 29 patients with an ESBL infection, 9 (31.0%) were 
discharged from the ED; an in vitro–inactive antimicro-
bial drug was initially prescribed to 7 (77.8%). Among 20 
(69.0%) hospitalized patients with an ESBL infection, 15 
(75.0%) were initially given an in vitro–inactive antimicro-
bial drug; 1 of those 15 patients was given gentamicin, 13 
were given cephalosporin, and 1 was given both.
Discussion
For 2013–2014, we found that prevalence of E. coli fluoro-
quinolone resistance was >10% for patients with uncompli-
cated pyelonephritis at 2 of 10 sites and >20% for patients 
with complicated infections at 4 of 10 sentinel sites surveyed 
in the United States. E. coli fluoroquinolone resistance was 
particularly prevalent in groups with antimicrobial drug resis-
tance risk. These rates exceed thresholds for the 2010 IDSA 
treatment guidelines, which recommend consideration of an

 RESEARCH
additional antimicrobial drug of a different class and other 
agents (9). Data from a similar study we conducted during 
2000–2004 (15) indicate that, among all healthcare-seeking 
ED patients with acute pyelonephritis, the prevalence of flu-
oroquinolone-resistant E. coli increased from 3.9% during 
2000–2004 to 11.7% during 2013–2014. During 2000–2004, 
we found no infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria. 
As in other parts of the world, ESBL-producing Enterobac-
teriaceae are emerging among patients with community-ac-
quired UTI in the United States. For patients with uncompli-
cated and complicated pyelonephritis caused by E. coli, we 
found that 2.6% and 12.2%, respectively, had infection caused 
by an ESBL-producing organism; rates were even higher for 
patients with risk factors. The globally disseminated, mul-
tidrug-resistant clone ST131, which produces CTX-M-15 
 
β-lactamase, accounted for 85.2% of these infections. Of 
ESBL-infected patients, about one third lacked traditional 
antimicrobial resistance risk factors (i.e., antimicrobial drug 
or healthcare-setting exposure or international travel), sug-
gesting that these isolates are now endemic in some US com-
munities. Among ESBL-infected patients, about three quar-
ters were initially treated with an antimicrobial drug lacking 
in vitro activity, including the sickest patients who required 
hospitalization. We did not collect outcome data, but lack 
of in vitro activity of the antimicrobial drug used for treat-
ment has been associated with relatively poor response rates 
among patients with pyelonephritis (1,10,11).
Previous surveys have suggested that E. coli fluoroqui-
nolone resistance rates are increasing in the United States. 
Among outpatients seeking care at 30 US centers during 
2003–2004, 59 (6.8%) of 862 E. coli isolates were resistant 
to ciprofloxacin (2). Another analysis of >12 million urine 
specimens from US outpatient centers found that the E. coli 
fluoroquinolone resistance rate increased from 3.0% in 2000 
to 17.1% in 2010 (3). Such laboratory-based resistance sur-
veillance data may exaggerate the prevalence of resistance 
because patients for whom cultures are performed would 
be expected to have received prior therapy and to have had 
healthcare exposure more frequently than patients without 
cultures. Isolate-driven studies require retrospective review 
of records, which have missing and inaccurate data; also, un-
certainty may exist regarding whether a specimen is from 
a patient with an actual clinical infection, rather than being 
a colonized or contaminated specimen. In routine practice, 
providers typically estimate local resistance rates on the ba-
sis of an antibiogram published by the local hospital labo-
ratory. Resistance rates determined from antibiograms are 
prone to bias and indicate only whether the specimen was 
obtained from an outpatient or inpatient location.
In contrast, we conducted syndromic surveillance of pa-
tients who sought care at a geographically diverse network

of US EDs. We studied acute pyelonephritis because it is a 
distinct clinical syndrome for which cultures are routinely 
obtained and because isolates grown are less likely to be con-
taminants or colonizers, compared with those from patients 
with suspected cystitis. Historical data were obtained by 
real-time patient interviews, enabling accurate classification 
of complicated and uncomplicated pyelonephritis and as-
certainment of antimicrobial drug resistance risk factors. To 
identify biases, we compared characteristics of enrolled and 
nonenrolled qualifying patients and found their characteris-
tics to be similar, suggesting the validity of our sampling. 
Consequently, our data and that of other studies indicate 
that, in some parts of the United States, the rate of E. coli 
fluoroquinolone resistance among uropathogens is >10% 
among patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis and 
>20% among those with complicated infections. However, 
variability exists; among patients with uncomplicated pyelo-
nephritis, 3 of 10 sites had fluoroquinolone resistance rates 
<5%. Consistent with findings of previous investigations, 
we found E. coli fluoroquinolone resistance associated with 
complicated infection, prior use of antimicrobial drugs and 
fluoroquinolone, hospitalization, and prior UTI caused by a 
fluoroquinolone- or ceftriaxone-resistant organism (16,17).
By using active, prospective surveillance, we found 
that ESBL-producing E. coli infections have now emerged 
to a considerable degree among patients with clinically con-
firmed community-acquired infections in parts of the United 
States, including among persons lacking commonly recog-
nized antimicrobial drug resistance risk factors. This new 
observation is not unexpected, given the reported epidemi-
ology of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections 
in communities outside North America. CTX-M enzymes 
are currently the most prevalent ESBL types worldwide. 
The ST131 clone is largely responsible for the international 
 
epidemic caused by CTX-M-15–producing E. coli, includ-
ing infections seen in the United States (7,18,19).
A few US laboratory-based surveillance studies have 
reported community-acquired ESBL infections. Peirano et 
al. (19) described ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from 30 
community-dwelling patients at 5 Chicago-area hospitals 
during 2008. These ESBL-producing strains represented 
2%–8% of E. coli isolates at each hospital. Khawcharoen-
porn et al. (20) reported that ≈5% of Enterobacteriaceae iso-
lates from ED patients with presumed UTI during 2008–2009 
were ESBL-producing, although specific risk data were not 
provided. Doi et al. (7) reviewed records of patients with cul-
tures that grew ESBL-producing E. coli isolates at 1 hospi-
tal in each of 5 US cities during 2009–2010. Among 13,270 
E. coli isolates, 523 (3.9%) were ESBL producing. Of the 
291 patients infected or colonized with ESBL-producing E. 
coli as outpatients, infections of 107 (36.8%) were thought 
to be community associated. Community ESBL-producing 
E. coli isolates were resistant to multiple agents: 87.5% to 
ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin and 39.4% to gentamicin. All 
isolates from that study were susceptible to a carbapenem; 
we also found that all ESBL-producing isolates in our inves-
tigation were susceptible to a carbapenem.
Studies from outside North America have identified 
several characteristics associated with ESBL infection, such 
as recurrent and complicated UTI; advanced age; recent 
hospitalization; use of a β-lactam or fluoroquinolone; travel 
to Asia, Middle East, or Africa; and fresh water swimming 
(5,21–23). Banerjee et al. (23) conducted a case–control 
study among adults with E. coli clinical isolates cultured in 
the Chicago area and found that ESBL infection was asso-
ciated with travel to India, ciprofloxacin use, and age. We 
found ESBL-producing E. coli infection associated with 
complicated infection, prior antimicrobial drug use, travel

outside North America, and prior UTI resulting from fluo-
roquinolone- or ceftriaxone-resistant infection. The impor-
tance of investigating past susceptibility data when consid-
ering empirical treatment is highlighted by our observation 
that both fluoroquinolone resistance and ESBL-production 
were associated with previous resistant infections.
Our study has limitations. We were unsuccessful in en-
rolling all consecutive patients, which may have introduced 
bias in our selection of patients. However, our audit of eli-
gible case-patients showed similarity of enrolled and non-
enrolled patients, including their E. coli antimicrobial drug 
susceptibility rates; furthermore, most (>97%) enrolled pa-
tients had urine cultures collected, reducing potential bias. 
The prevalence of ESBL-producing strains may have been 
underestimated because we did not use ESBL-selective me-
dia and used only ceftriaxone instead of several advanced-
generation cephalosporins to screen for presence of ESBL-
producing strains. However, this method enabled us to have 
greater site participation; furthermore, screening isolates 
with a ceftriaxone MIC >1 µg/mL has been reported to have 
a sensitivity >98% on the basis of phenotypic testing (24). 
In addition, some patients may not have had pyelonephritis 
if a contaminated specimen was misinterpreted as noncon-
taminated, although >97% of patients had urine collected by 
a technique that minimizes contamination (i.e., clean catch, 
urethral catheterization, or suprapubic aspiration), and the 
diagnosis of pyelonephritis was further supported by clinical 
assessment. Our definition of confirmed infection as growth 
of 1 uropathogen at >104 CFU/mL may have missed some 
cases of pyelonephritis, although only ≈5% grew a single 
uropathogen at <104 CFU/mL or grew >1 uropathogen at 
>104 CFU/mL. Our hospitals were large US urban centers 
and may not represent patients in other settings, emphasizing 
the importance of local surveillance.
IDSA treatment guidelines for acute uncomplicated 
pyelonephritis recommend that, if the fluoroquinolone-resis-
tance rate is >10%, then in addition to a fluoroquinolone, an 
agent of another class (i.e., ceftriaxone or gentamicin) should 
be administered (9). Our findings indicate that fluoroquino-
lone resistance rates for E. coli are approaching or exceed 
this threshold for patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis 
in many parts of the United States. For uncomplicated cys-
titis, the guidelines recommend alternative agents if the re-
sistance rate is >20%, which is the current situation for fluo-
roquinolones in many settings for patients with complicated 
pyelonephritis. Unfortunately, we found that only one half to 
two thirds of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates were 
susceptible to ceftriaxone or gentamicin. Rates of fluoroqui-
nolone-resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli infections cor-
relate to geographic location. Prior exposure to antimicrobial 
drugs or a healthcare setting, travel outside the United States, 
and a history of an antimicrobial drug–resistant infection 
substantially increases the chance that a person will have a 
current fluoroquinolone-resistant or ESBL-producing E. coli 
infection. Therefore, in settings with high fluoroquinolone 
resistance rates, in settings where ESBL-producing Entero-
bacteriaceae infections have emerged, or among persons 
with antimicrobial drug resistance risk factors (especially 
patients with or at risk for severe sepsis), healthcare provid-
ers should consider empirical treatment with a carbapenem 
or another agent found to be consistently active on the basis 
of the local antibiogram. In this study, ≈50% of patients with 
pyelonephritis were managed as outpatients. Currently, no 
oral antimicrobial drugs with consistent in vitro activity are 
available for empirical treatment of pyelonephritis caused 
by ESBL-producing E. coli uropathogens. Our findings, in-
cluding the variability in the prevalence of resistance by site, 
show that increased local efforts to enhance surveillance for 
antimicrobial drug resistance are necessary to best inform 
treatment decisions. Furthermore, availability of new anti-
microbial drugs must be expedited.
