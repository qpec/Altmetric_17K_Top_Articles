BACKGROUND: Sleep difficulties are commonly reported by patients with asthma; however, the
prevalence of insomnia and its association with disease burden and well-being is unknown.
We aimed to determine the prevalence of insomnia, defined as combined sleep-specific
complaints with associated daytime symptoms, among a large sample of adults with
asthma, and to compare well-being, asthma control, and asthma-related health care utili-
zation in individuals with asthma and insomnia and those without insomnia.
METHODS: Baseline data from adults with physician-confirmed asthma enrolled in the Severe
Asthma Research Program III was used for analyses (N ¼ 714). Participants completed the
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Asthma Control Test, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire,
and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
RESULTS: Insomnia (ISI $ 10) was identified in 263 participants (37%). Presence of insomnia
was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms and poorer quality of
life. Those with insomnia had a 2.4-fold increased risk for having not well-controlled asthma
and a 1.5-fold increased risk for asthma-related health care utilization in the past year
compared with those without insomnia.
CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia is highly prevalent in asthma and is associated with adverse out-
comes. Further studies are needed to gain a better understanding of the interaction between
insomnia and asthma control.

 Asthma exacerbations are exceedingly common and
result in nearly one-half million hospitalizations and
roughly 2 million ED visits yearly.1,2 Health care
utilization and reductions in quality of life are greatest
among those with poorly controlled asthma.3-5 With
> 50% of patients failing to achieve disease control,6
identifying additional approaches for optimizing asthma
control is critical for the prevention of serious asthma
exacerbations and the consequent reduction in
hospitalizations and ED visits.
Sleep difficulties are commonly reported among
persons with asthma, with 22% to 47% reporting
difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and
> 75% reporting poor sleep quality.7-12 Sleep difficulties
are often considered a consequence of nocturnal
awakenings resulting from nighttime asthma symptoms
and/or the need for rescue inhaler medication, which
will resolve with adequate control of asthma symptoms.
Previous studies suggest that sleep difficulties persist
even in those without asthma-related nocturnal
awakenings, with 20% to 46% reporting moderate to
severe difficulty staying asleep.7,10,12 These data suggest
that poor sleep may not solely be due to nighttime
asthma awakenings, but may represent comorbid
insomnia. Insomnia disorder is characterized by self-
reported difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or poor
quality sleep and accompanying daytime symptoms
such as fatigue, irritability, and impaired concentration.
The prevalence of insomnia in asthma is unknown,
because previous studies have only examined sleep-
specific complaints without assessment of associated
daytime symptoms.7-12
The impact of insomnia on asthma control and asthma-
related health care utilization has not been examined.
Limited studies have shown associations between
difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings at night
and nighttime asthma symptoms and rescue inhaler use,
both of which are indications of poor asthma
control.7-9,12,13 The aims of the present study were to
determine the prevalence of insomnia, defined as
combined sleep-specific complaints with associated
daytime symptoms, among a large sample of adults with
physician-diagnosed asthma, and to compare asthma
control, well-being, and asthma-related health care
utilization in those with asthma and insomnia and those
without insomnia.
Methods
Study Participants
Participants were part of the longitudinal phase (III) of the ongoing
multicenter Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). Details of
SARP I-II have been previously described.14 Participants were
current nonsmokers or had less than 5 pack years of smoking and
were classified according to the European Respiratory Society/
American Thoracic Society’s definition of severe asthma.15 Each
institutional review board approved the study and informed consent
was obtained from all participants (e-Table 1).
Of the 957 participants who met eligibility criteria and were enrolled in
SARP III, 228 were excluded because they were < 18 years of age. An
additional 15 were excluded because of missing data on the Insomnia
Severity Index (ISI); thus, our final sample included a total of 714
participants.
Measures
All questionnaires and pulmonary function testing were conducted at
the baseline visit. SARP-specific questionnaires were administered to
gather
data
on
demographics,
smoking,
medical
history
and
comorbidities (gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD] and sleep
apnea),
medication
history,
and
asthma-related
health
care
utilization, including unscheduled doctor visits, ED visits, hospital
admissions, and ICU admissions. In addition to analyzing each
health care use separately, an overall asthma-related health care
utilization variable was created to represent any of the previously
mentioned health care use in the prior year.
The ISI is a seven-item scale assessing current (past 2 weeks) perceived
severity of symptoms (difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep,
and early morning awakenings), satisfaction with current sleep pattern,
interference with daytime functioning, noticeability of impairment
resulting from the sleep problem, and degree of concern caused by
the sleep problem.16 A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item
(0 ¼ not at all, 4 ¼ extremely), with scores ranging from 0 to 28. A
cutoff of $ 10 has been shown to optimize sensitivity (86.1%) and
specificity (87.7%) in community samples.17 The ISI has good
psychometric properties.16,17
The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses
interference with activity, shortness of breath, nocturnal symptoms,
rescue medication use, and self-rating of asthma control.18,19 Each
item is scored using a scale of 1 to 5. Total scores range from 5 to
25, with higher scores indicating better asthma control. Cutoff scores
for well-controlled asthma (ACT $ 20), not well-controlled asthma
(ACT 16-19), and uncontrolled asthma (ACT # 15) have been
established.18,19
Asthma
control
was
categorized
as
not
well-
controlled defined as an ACT score # 19.
The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) is a 32-item
measure assessing condition-specific health-related quality of life
within four life domains: activity limitations, symptoms, emotional
distress, and environmental stimuli.20 Each item is rated from 1
(totally impaired) to 7 (not at all impaired). An overall AQLQ score
is computed by averaging the four domains. The AQLQ has
demonstrated excellent psychometric properties.21
The Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS) is a 14-item self-
report questionnaire designed to assess the occurrence of depression
and anxiety symptoms in the past week.22 Items on both subscales
(HADS-D for depression and HADS-A for anxiety) are rated on a
4-point response scale (0-3). Scores for each subscale range from
0 to 21. The HADS-D and HADS-A have acceptable internal
journal.publications.chestnet.org
1243
 consistency with Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.67 to 0.93.23
Probable depression and anxiety was defined as a HADS-D and
HADS-A scores $ 8.23
Pulmonary function testing was performed according to American
Thoracic Society guidelines.24 FEV1 percent predicted and FVC
percent predicted were recorded.25
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages,
and continuous variables as mean � SD. Comparisons of variables
between those with and those without insomnia were performed
using Student t test or c2 test. African Americans were compared
with Caucasians and all other races combined. Logistic regression
was used to test the associations of insomnia with dichotomous
dependent
variables
(asthma
control,
depression,
anxiety,
and
asthma-related health care utilization) in both univariate and
multivariate analyses. For continuous dependent variables, linear
regression was performed. The following covariates were included
in all regression analyses: age, sex, BMI, oral corticosteroid use in
the past 3 months, GERD, and sleep apnea. Removal of the sleep
items from the calculation of the ACT and AQLQ total scores did
not yield differing results in analyses so these items were retained.
A two-sided P value < .05 was set for statistical significance. SPSS
23 for Windows (SPSS Inc) was used to conduct the statistical
analyses.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of
participants. No differences in age, sex, race, smoking
status, or asthma duration were found between the
participants with and without insomnia. Those with
insomnia had a higher BMI, worse lung functions, and
lower annual household income than those without
insomnia. Participants with insomnia had more frequent
self-reported GERD and sleep apnea compared with
those without insomnia. Among those without insomnia
and self-reported sleep apnea (n ¼ 71), 42 (59%) were
being treated with CPAP or BiPAP. Among those with
insomnia and self-reported sleep apnea (n ¼ 76), 50
(66%) were being treated with CPAP or BiPAP.
Insomnia Symptoms
The mean ISI score in the overall sample was 8.3 (6.3).
Using a cutoff of $ 10 on the ISI, clinically significant
insomnia was present in 37% (283 of 714) of
participants with asthma, with 34% reporting severe to
very severe difficulty falling asleep, 36% reporting severe
to very severe difficulty staying asleep, 31% reporting
severe to very severe problems with waking up too early,
and 33% reporting much to very much interference with
daily functioning. Greater insomnia severity was
associated with more frequent nighttime asthma
symptoms that disturbed sleep (ie, ACT item, “During
the past 4 weeks, how often did your asthma symptoms
[wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, chest tightness
or pain) wake you up at night or earlier than usual in the
morning?”] (r ¼ -0.42, P < .001). To distinguish
insomnia from nocturnal awakenings resulting from
nighttime asthma symptoms, the previously mentioned
item from the ACT was used to identify participants
who did not have nighttime asthma symptoms that
disturbed their sleep (n ¼ 267 within the total sample).
Of these individuals, 23% (n ¼ 62) had clinically
significant insomnia.
Insomnia and Asthma Control and Well-being
As shown in Table 2, participants with insomnia had
worse asthma control and asthma-specific quality of life
and higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms.
More than 75% of participants with insomnia had
asthma that was not well-controlled defined by an ACT
score of # 19, whereas roughly one-half of those without
insomnia had not well-controlled asthma (c2 ¼ 41.19,
P < .001). Of the participants with not well-controlled
asthma (n ¼ 204), those with insomnia had worse
asthma control than those without insomnia (mean
ACT score ¼ 15.12 � 3.18 and 12.77 � 4.01,
respectively) (t ¼ 6.82, P < .001). Using a cutoff score
of $ 8 on the HADS to indicate probable depression and
anxiety, those with insomnia had higher proportions
with probable depression and anxiety compared with
participants without insomnia (23% vs 6% and
51% vs 19%, respectively) (c ¼ 42.39, p <0.001;
c ¼ 81.84, p <0.001).
Insomnia and Asthma-Related Health Care
Utilization
Compared to those without insomnia, analyses of asthma-
related health care utilization showed participants with
insomnia reported more frequent health care use in the
past 12 months, including unscheduled doctor visit
(53% vs 39%), emergency room visit (37% vs 19%), and
hospital admission (15% vs 9%) (all P < .01) (Fig 1). ICU
admissions in the past 12 months were similar between
the two groups. Overall, 60% of participants with
insomnia reported having any asthma-related health care
utilization (including unscheduled doctor visit,
emergency room visit, hospital admission, and/or ICU
admission) in the past year compared with 45% of those
without insomnia (c2 ¼ 15.21, P < .001). Among
1244
Original Research

 participants with controlled asthma (ACT score > 19)
(n ¼ 269), those with insomnia more frequently
reported having an unscheduled doctor visit (44% vs 28%)
and any asthma-related health care use (48% vs 31%)
in the past 12 months than those without insomnia
(P values ¼ 0.02) (Fig 2). Emergency room visits, hospital
admissions, and ICU admissions were similar between the
two groups with controlled asthma. Among participants
with not well-controlled asthma (ACT score # 19), those
with insomnia had a higher frequency of emergency room
visits in the past year (42% vs 28%) than those without
insomnia (P ¼ .002). No differences were found in the
other asthma-related health care utilization variables
between the two groups with not well-controlled asthma.

 Univariate and Multivariable Analyses
Analyses were performed with presence of insomnia as
the independent factor and asthma control, quality of
life, depression, anxiety, and health care utilization as
dependent variables. In univariate analyses, having
insomnia was associated with increased odds for having
not well-controlled asthma, probable depression and
anxiety, and asthma-related health care utilization in the
past year (Table 3). Having insomnia was associated
with worse asthma-specific quality of life. With
adjustment for age, sex, BMI, oral corticosteroid use,
GERD, and sleep apnea, all relationships remained
statistically significant (Table 3), although the magnitude
of the estimates was slightly reduced. More specifically,
those with insomnia had a 2.4-fold greater odds of
having not well-controlled asthma (95% CI, 1.7-3.4;
P < .001), 3.5-fold greater odds of having probable
depression (95% CI, 2.1-5.8; P < .001), 4.6-fold odds
of having probable anxiety (95% CI, 3.2-6.6; P < .001),
and 1.5-fold odds of having asthma-related health care
utilization (95% CI, 1.0-2.0; P ¼ .03) compared with
those without insomnia.

 Discussion
In this study, we examined the prevalence of insomnia
disorder in a large sample of adults with physician-
diagnosed asthma and its associations with asthma
control and disease-specific health care utilization. The
prevalence of insomnia disorder was found to be
approximately three times higher than rates reported in
the general population.26 Presence of insomnia was
associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety
symptoms, worse asthma control, poorer quality of
life, and more frequent asthma-related health care
utilization. These results suggest that adults with asthma
who have insomnia disorder may be at increased risk for
adverse outcomes.

 The high prevalence of insomnia in patients with asthma
(37%) confirms prior reports of disturbed sleep in
asthma.7-12 A key strength of our study is that it assessed
the prevalence of insomnia symptoms and associated
daytime consequences that encapsulate the diagnostic
criteria presented in the International Classification of
Sleep Disorders-Third Edition.27 Our findings indicate
that poor sleep may not be entirely related to nocturnal
awakenings resulting from asthma symptoms.7,10,12
Despite reporting no nighttime asthma symptoms that
disturbed their sleep, almost 25% of participants met
criteria for clinically significant insomnia.
Our results strengthen previous findings in patients with
asthma in which disturbed sleep was associated with
greater depression and anxiety and lower disease-
specific quality of life.10,11,28,29 Studies in patients with
asthma, including severe asthma, that used the HADS,
found rates of depression and anxiety to be 9% to
14% and 11% to 37%, respectively,29,30-32 which are
lower than the prevalence rates found in participants
with asthma and insomnia. The AQLQ score in
participants with asthma and no insomnia were similar
to the score found in a population-based study of 864
adults with asthma.33 The presence of insomnia in
patients with asthma may lead to more severe
depression and anxiety symptoms and further
reductions in quality of life.
The current study provides further evidence for an
association between sleep difficulties and asthma control
and builds upon this evidence by also examining
asthma-related health care utilization. We found a 2.4-
fold increased risk for having not well-controlled asthma
and a 1.5-fold increased risk for asthma-related health
care utilization in the past year in participants with
insomnia relative to those without insomnia.
Furthermore, participants with well-controlled asthma
and insomnia had more frequent unscheduled doctor
visits and overall disease-specific health care use than
those with well-controlled asthma without insomnia.
This suggests that comorbid insomnia may play an
important role in asthma outcomes. Although the
potential mechanisms whereby insomnia may aggravate
asthma have not been explored, sleep loss and sleep
difficulties (similar to insomnia) have been shown to
decrease lung function and increase systemic
inflammation.34-37 We found worse lung function (FEV1
percent predicted and FVC percent predicted predicted)
among those with insomnia compared with those
without insomnia.
The study has several limitations. First, the cross-
sectional nature of the data precludes causal inferences.
The interaction between insomnia and asthma is likely
to be bidirectional; however, intervention studies, such
as implementing cognitive-behavioral treatment for
insomnia, are needed to provide more insight into the
likely complex relationship between insomnia and
asthma control. Second, the assessment of GERD and
sleep apnea were based on self-report rather than gold
standards to diagnose GERD and sleep apnea; thus, we
may not have captured all individuals with GERD or
sleep apnea. Third, we did not have a matched control
group free of respiratory disease, which would have
allowed for comparison of insomnia prevalence between
those with asthma and those without respiratory disease.
Finally, other potential contributing factors to asthma
control and asthma-related health care utilization,
including recurrent respiratory infections, could have
influenced the results.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that insomnia is highly prevalent
in adults with asthma and is associated with worse
asthma control, higher prevalence of depression and
anxiety symptoms and worse disease-specific quality of
life, and more frequent asthma-related health care
utilization independent of oral corticosteroid use and
relevant comorbidities, including sleep apnea and
GERD. Prospective and intervention studies are needed
gain a deeper understanding of the interaction between
insomnia and asthma control and the possible
underlying mechanisms. Our study demonstrated a
significant impact of comorbid insomnia on disease
burden and well-being; therefore, evaluation and
treatment of insomnia should be considered among
patients with asthma.
