Outcomes Associated With Early Preventive Dental Care
Among Medicaid-Enrolled Children in Alabama
Justin Blackburn, PhD; Michael A. Morrisey, PhD; Bisakha Sen, PhD
IMPORTANCE There is a recommendation for children to have a dental home by 6 months of
age, but there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of early preventive dental care
or whether primary care providers (PCPs) can deliver it.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effectiveness of preventive dental care in reducing
caries-related treatment visits among Medicaid enrollees.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS High-dimensional propensity scores were used to
address selection bias for a retrospective cohort study of children continuously enrolled in
coverage from the Alabama Medicaid Agency from birth between 2008 and 2012, adjusting
for demographics, access to care, and general health service use.
EXPOSURES Children receiving preventive dental care prior to age 2 years from PCPs or
dentists vs no preventive dental care.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Two-part models estimated caries-related treatment and
expenditures.
RESULTS Among 19 658 eligible children, 25.8% (n = 3658) received early preventive dental
care, of whom 44% were black, 37.6% were white, and 16.3% were Hispanic. Compared
with matched children without early preventive dental care, children with dentist-delivered
preventive dental care more frequently had a subsequent caries-related treatment (20.6% vs
11.3%, P < .001), higher rate of visits (0.29 vs 0.15 per child-year, P < .001), and greater dental
expenditures ($168 vs $87 per year, P < .001). Dentist-delivered preventive dental care was
associated with an increase in the expected number of caries-related treatment visits by 0.14
per child per year (95% CI, 0.11-0.16) and caries-related treatment expenditures by $40.77
per child per year (95% CI, $30.48-$51.07). Primary care provider–delivered preventive
dental care did not significantly affect caries-related treatment use or expenditures.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children with early preventive care visits from dentists were
more likely to have subsequent dental care, including caries-related treatment, and greater
expenditures than children without preventive dental care. There was no association with
subsequent caries-related treatment and preventive dental care from PCPs. We observed no
evidence of a benefit of early preventive dental care, regardless of the provider. Additional
research beyond administrative data may be necessary to elucidate any benefits of early
preventive dental care.

T
ooth decay, otherwise known as dental caries, is cited
as the most common chronic disease among children.1
It disproportionately affects minority and low–
socioeconomic status children2 and is associated with many
poor outcomes including loss of teeth,1 impaired growth,3 de-
creasedweightgain,3poorschoolperformance,4andpoorqual-
ity of life.5 Contributing factors include lack of access to den-
tal care,2 low community water fluoride levels,6 and a lack of
parental knowledge about prevention.7
The landmark report1 by the US Surgeon General in 2000
helped shape oral health policy in the subsequent 15 years.8
In addition to emphasizing the importance of oral health on
general health and well-being, the report called for improved
oral health through prevention. A greater emphasis on early
preventive dental care resulted, prompting recommenda-
tions that children have a dental home “within 6 months of
the first tooth eruption and no later than 12 months of age.
”9,10
Pediatricians have been increasingly encouraged to pro-
vide oral care.11 In addition to dental coverage under Early Pe-
riodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, many Medicaid
agencieshaveinitiativesforprimarycareproviders(PCPs)toin-
corporate preventive dental care into well-child visits. For ex-
ample,Alabamainitiatedthe1stLookprograminJanuary2009,
expanding coverage to allow PCPs reimbursement for an oral
examinationand3fluoridevarnishesperyearforchildrenathigh
riskofcaries.12Before1stLook,preventivedentalserviceswere
delivered by health care professionals other than dentists at
Federally Qualified Health Centers in Alabama. 1st Look and
similar programs in other states are designed to increase ac-
cess, particularly in locations underserved by dentists.13-15
Despite the emphasis on prevention, dental caries among
children younger than 5 years has been increasing.16 To our
knowledge, evidence that early preventive dental care re-
duces caries is lacking, nor is there any convincing evidence
supporting PCP oral health screenings, referrals to dentists, or
fluoride services reducing caries. A recent review17 concluded
that the evidence for early preventive dental care recommen-
dations reducing caries was “weak.
” A widely cited study rec-
ommended the benefits of early preventive dental care be-
cause children with a visit by 1 year of age were “more likely to
have subsequent preventive visits but were not more likely
to have a subsequent restorative or emergency visits.
”18 This
finding resulted from data on 23 Medicaid-enrolled children in
North Carolina. Much of the existing literature comes from
North Carolina’
s Medicaid program, with mixed results. Ex-
amples include reduced caries-related treatment only when
children received multiple fluoride applications annually19,20
or preventive and restorative care simultaneously.21 Other
evaluations observed no difference in subsequent restorative
costs,18,22 while some observed increased caries-related treat-
mentforchildrenwithatleast1preventivevisit.23Multiplestud-
ieshaveobservedthatchildrenwithearlypreventivedentalcare
had worse outcomes than children initiating later.21,24,25 In
Alabama, preventive dental care among Children’
s Health In-
surance Program enrollees was associated with small reduc-
tions in subsequent restorative care.26,27
Our objective was to investigate the effectiveness of early
preventive dental care in reducing early childhood caries
among Medicaid enrollees. One limitation of previous stud-
ies is selection bias—namely that children receiving preven-
tive dental care may differ on unmeasured characteristics from
their counterparts, including preventive health behaviors or
familyhistoriesofdentalproblems.Weusedanempiricalstrat-
egy to minimize the effect of selection bias. Furthermore, we
investigated how the effectiveness of early preventive dental
care differed by provider type. Finally, we considered an analy-
sis among children receiving early preventive dental care
comparing whether the frequency of care was associated with
subsequent caries-related treatment.
Methods
Sample and Design
This study was approved by Alabama Medicaid and the insti-
tutional review board at the University of Alabama at Birming-
ham, which waived informed consent because of the retro-
spective nature of the study. We conducted a retrospective
cohort study using administrative data of children continu-
ously enrolled in Medicaid from birth for 3 or more years be-
ginning September 2007 through October 2012. We consid-
ered enrollment at birth if the child was enrolled by 180 days
after birth. We used Medicaid enrollment data to construct an-
nual observation files and medical claims data to identify pre-
ventive dental visits and expenditures within the first 2 years
of life. We calculated annual caries-related visits and expen-
dituresalongwithtotaldentalexpendituresforchildrenintheir
third through sixth year of enrollment or when they were no
longer enrolled in Medicaid. To ensure that children were ac-
tually using Medicaid, we restricted the analysis to enrollees
with at least 1 paid claim. We also excluded children in the top
1% of total expenditures (more than $38 682, 203 partici-
pants) because they may have had profound health condi-
tions contraindicating or restricting their access to dental care.

Key Points
Question Does early preventive dental care reduce caries-related
treatment and does the provider matter?
Findings A retrospective cohort study of 19 658 children
continuously enrolled in Medicaid from birth estimated the effect
of early preventive dental care on caries-related visits and
expenditures. Dentist-delivered care was associated with an
increase of 0.14 caries-related visits per child-year and a $40.77
increase in expenditures per child-year compared with primary
care providers, who had no statistically significant effect.
Meaning There was no evidence that early preventive dental care
reduced caries-related visits regardless of provider; however,
dentist-delivered care was associated with increased caries-related
use and expenditures.

ered high-frequency preventive dental care to be 4 or more vis-
its during the first 2 years of life, which is consistent with other
studies reporting effects at this threshold.19,20,23
Outcome Measures
The main outcome measure was annual caries-related visits
andexpendituresbeginninginthechild’
sthirdyearoflife.Con-
sistent with prior studies, we defined caries-related visits as
containing at least 1 Current Dental Terminology code be-
tween D2000 and D9999 on a single date of service.19,20,23
We considered caries-related expenditures as the amount paid
by Medicaid for visits providing these procedures. We consid-
ered total expenditures as all paid expenditures to dental pro-
viders (including subsequent preventive visits after the first
2 years of life). All expenditures were adjusted for inflation to
2012 using the Consumer Price Index.
Covariates
We used high-dimensional propensity score matching to ac-
count for biases related to differences between children re-
ceiving and not receiving early preventive dental care during
their first 2 years of life.28 This enabled us to derive up to 50
variables on health care use and comorbid conditions from
claims data based on the association with the treatment and
outcome.29 Thus, the technique matches children on the pre-
dicted likelihood of receiving preventive dental care based on
demographics, procedures, medications, and diagnoses to re-
duce bias introduced by parental preferences for health ser-
vice use, including the use of preventive services and exist-
ing health conditions that influence receiving dental care.
The propensity score included all inpatient primary diag-
nosis codes, outpatient diagnosis and procedure codes, and
pharmacy claims for children from birth through their second
birthday. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion (ICD-9) diagnosis codes were grouped using the Clinical
Classification Software single-level definitions. Pharmacy use
was grouped by American Hospital Formulary System thera-
peutic class. We excluded all dental-related diagnoses and pro-
cedures. Furthermore, because we included a specific variable
forwell-childvisits,weexcludedtheseclaimsasdescribedlater.
Previous studies indicate that socioeconomic status is
associated with the low use of dental care and tooth decay.2,7
Socioeconomic status within the Medicaid population is ho-
mogenous, but other potential confounders included in pro-
pensity scores were sex, race/ethnicity, and birth year. Race/
ethnicity was classified as white, black, Hispanic, and all other
races based on the available enrollment information. We used
4-level zip code approximation rural-urban commuting area
codes as a marker of rural-urban status.
To indicate access to dentists, we estimated dentist supply
using all Medicaid dental claims for children, regardless of age
andeligibilityinthecurrentstudy,from2007through2012.Using
uniqueNationalProviderIdentifiernumbersfromdentalclaims,
we aggregated to the county level. Because of county variabil-
ity,thismeasurewasrankedanddividedintooctiles,thefirsthav-
ingthefewestMedicaid-servingdentistsandtheeighththegreat-
est.Sensitivityanalysesdeterminedthatdifferentspecifications
of this variable did not change the final model estimation.
We considered the number of well-child visits as a mea-
sure of preventive-care seeking behavior. We used procedure
and diagnostic codes consistent with the National Committee
for Quality Assurance measure of well-child visits in the first
15 months of life.30 This measure was ranked and divided into
quartiles, the first quartile having the fewest and the fourth
the greatest. Because of ties, quartiles were not evenly distrib-
uted. Sensitivity analyses determined different specifications
did not change the final model estimation.
We could not obtain reliable information on water fluori-
dation for the entire study period. We included county fixed
effects to control for variations in dental care-seeking behav-
ior related to community water fluoridation or other unob-
served heterogeneities.
We separately estimated propensity scores and matched
children who received preventive care from dentists and PCPs.
Childrenwhoreceivedcarefrombothtypesofproviderswithin
the first 2 years of life were few (n=362) and were excluded.
In each analysis, propensity scores matched children who re-
ceived preventive dental care with children who did not using
the nearest neighbor technique with a caliper of 0.05 of the
propensity score. Follow-up duration for a pair was deter-
mined by the longest common follow-up duration, dropping
unmatched years. Among children who received preventive
dental care, we estimated and matched unique propensity
scores to compare children who received high frequency care
(4 or more visits) vs 1 to 3 visits.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were stratified by the type of provider: dentists or
PCPs. We compared matched descriptive characteristics for
children receiving preventive dental care compared with
those who were not, using standardized differences more
than 10 as a measure of imbalance. Dental care use and
expenditures were compared using tests of proportions or
ttests when appropriate. We estimated 2-part models to pro-
vide the combined effect of preventive dental care on any
caries-related visits, the annual number of caries-related vis-
its, and associated expenditures. We estimated the first part,
any caries-related visit, using logit regression. The second
part, the annual number of caries-related visits, was esti-
mated by generalized linear models with a log-link negative
binomial distribution because of the outcome’
s skewed
nature. Expenditure outcomes were estimated by log-linked
γ distribution. Both models included a robust variance esti-
mator to account for longitudinal matched-child correlation.
Our main effect measure was the combined marginal effects,
which represented the absolute difference in caries-related
visits or expenditures if an untreated child had received

Table 3 lists the 2-part regression test results for caries-
related outcomes among children receiving preventive den-
tal care from dentists. The first column represents the unad-
justed predicted value for each outcome, interpreted as the
proportion of caries-related visits (or expenditures) per child
per year. Columns 2 and 3 display coefficients from logit and
generalized linear models, respectively. The predicted value
of caries-related visits was 0.22 per child per year. Dentist-
delivered preventive care increased the predicted number of
caries-related visits by 0.14 per child per year (95% CI, 0.11-
0.16). Likewise, predicted caries-related expenditures were
$70.50 per child per year, with preventive dental care adding
$40.77 per child per year (95% CI, $30.48-$51.07). Total den-
tal expenditures increased by $84.96 per child per year (95%
CI, $72.76-$97.17) for those with preventive dental care. None
of the equivalent models for PCP-delivered preventive dental
care shown in Table 3 yielded statistically significant effects
at the conventional levels.
Among 3878 children with dentist-delivered preventive
dental care, 1061 (27.4%) received 4 or more visits before their
second birthday (ie, high frequency). Similarly, 180 of the 1217

recommendhavingestablishedadentalhomeforchildrenbyage
6 months, but this lacks conclusive evidence of improved out-
comes. We evaluated the effectiveness of early preventive den-
tal care in preventing caries-related visits among Medicaid-
enrolledchildren,usinghigh-dimensional-propensityscoresto
reduce selection bias. We have 3 principal findings. First, chil-
drenwhoreceivedearlypreventivedentalcarefromdentistswere
morelikelytohavecaries-relatedvisitsandgreatercaries-related
expendituresthanchildrenwithoutpreventivedentalcare.Sec-
ond, children receiving preventive dental care from PCPs had
similarcaries-relatedvisitsandexpenditurescomparedwithchil-
dren without preventive dental care. Finally, the frequency of
preventive dental care did not modify this effect.
Our observations are consistent with previous findings
demonstrating an association between early preventive dental
care and increased caries-related treatments.21,23-25 One expla-
nationisthatparentsandguardiansmayrecognizesignsoftooth
decay and are more likely to use dental services. At the popu-
lationlevel,thiswouldresultinagreateruseofpreventiveden-
tal care by children with existing problems, and would in-
crease subsequent caries-related visits and expenditures
comparedwithuntreatedcounterparts.Underthisscenario,our
analysiscoulddemonstrateaspuriousassociation.Ourempiri-
calstrategyattemptedtominimizethisbyaccountingforhealth
service use, health status, and access to dentists. Much of the
restorative dental paradigm is early detection and treatment to
prevent worse future outcomes.1 This too could explain subse-
quent increases in caries-related visits and expenditures fol-
lowingpreventivedentalcare.Analternativeexplanationisthat
dentists have an incentive to perform restorative procedures,
a phenomenon of supplier-induced demand previously ob-
served when the supply of dentists exceeds demand.31
Declining numbers of dentists accepting Medicaid or other
barriers to dental care have increased the involvement of PCPs
inoralhealth.1,13Incorporatingpreventivedentalcareintowell-
childvisitsandallowingadditionalreimbursementfortheseser-
vices has been proposed as an efficient way to increase the pro-
vision of this care.13-15 Primary care provider–delivered
preventive dental care has been associated with fewer caries-
related visits and decayed, missing, and filled teeth.15,23 We did
not observe any association between caries-related visits or ex-
penditures from PCP-delivered preventive dental care. How-
ever, caries may be underdiagnosed among this group. For ex-
ample, Kranz et al32 observed that PCP-delivered preventive
dental care appeared to result in fewer decayed, missing, and
filledteeth,butthosechildrenwerelaterobservedtohavemore
untreated decayed teeth compared with those treated by
dentists.32
Previous studies have observed the benefits of preven-
tivedentalcareonlywhenchildrenreceive4ormorevisits,19,20
suggesting that consistency is key. However, randomized clini-
caltrialshaveobservedcaries-relatedreductionsfromanyfluo-
ride application, suggesting that a single application is
beneficial.33Mostofourstudypopulationreceivedfluorideap-
plications; therefore. we tested whether high-frequency pre-
ventive dental care had an additive effect. Our findings were
not sensitive to this threshold and were consistent with the
main analysis for both provider types.
Limitations
Our findings must be interpreted with some limitations. First,
claims data cannot capture any indirect benefits of preventive
dental care, such as reductions in missed school days or an im-
proved quality of life. Nor is it possible to evaluate the clinical
need for caries-related visits, the presence of caries and tooth
decay, or variations in the quality of care provided. Likewise,
we do not have information regarding behaviors related to oral
health, such as teeth brushing. Despite our efforts to minimize
selection bias through restrictions and the use of high-
dimensional propensity scores, residual unmeasured parental
orchildcharacteristicsmaypredisposesomechildrentousepre-
ventive dental care. We controlled for county effects, but wa-
ter supplies in Alabama do not conform to county boundaries
and there is a noticeable variation over time in Alabama’
s wa-
ter fluoridation. This lack of precise data on water fluoridation
mayresultinconfounding.Finally,ourstudypopulationofcon-
tinuously-enrolledMedicaidenrolleesfrombirthinasinglestate
may not generalize to other populations.

Conclusions
Adding to a limited body of literature on early preventive den-
tal care, we observed little evidence of the benefits of this care,
regardless of the provider. In fact, preventive dental care from
dentists appears to increase caries-related treatment, which
issurprising.Additionalresearchamongotherpopulationsand
beyond administrative data may be necessary to elucidate the
true effects of early preventive dental care.
