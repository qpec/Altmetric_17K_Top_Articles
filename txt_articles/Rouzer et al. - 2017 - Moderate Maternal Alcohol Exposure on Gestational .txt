Among the numerous consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is an increase in
anxiety-like behavior that can prove debilitating to daily functioning. A significant body of
literature has linked gestational day 12 (G12) heavy ethanol exposure with social anxiety,
evident in adolescent males and females. However, the association between non-social
anxiety-like behavior and moderate alcohol exposure, a more common pattern of
drinking in pregnant women, is yet unidentified. To model moderate PAE (mPAE), we
exposed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats to either room air or vaporized ethanol for 6 h
on G12. Adolescent offspring were then tested on postnatal days (P) 41–47 in one
of the following four anxiety assays: novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH), elevated plus
maze (EPM), light-dark box (LDB) and open-field (OF). Our findings revealed significant
increases in measures of anxiety-like behavior in male PAE offspring in the NIH, LDB and
OF, with no differences observed in females on any test. Additionally, male offspring who
demonstrated heightened anxiety-like behavior as adolescents demonstrated decreased
anxiety-like behavior in adulthood, as measured by a marble-burying test (MBT), while
females continued to be unaffected in adulthood. These results suggest that mPAE leads
to dynamic changes in anxiety-like behavior exclusively in male offspring.

INTRODUCTION
Maternal alcohol consumption can contribute to a variety of deficits which can be broadly
defined as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs). In-school assessments of FASDs in the
United States place conservative estimates of prevalence at 1% of the population, with these
numbers doubling in Italy and sextupling in South Africa (May et al., 2009). However, the
Institute of Medicine’s diagnostic criteria suggests this rate may be closer to 2%–5% in the US
and Europe, a likely under-estimated rate due to the stigma associated with maternal ethanol
consumption (Corrigan et al., 2017). FASDs can manifest through physical, behavioral, cognitive
and psychological impairments that range in classification from mild to severe (Autti-Rämö
and Granström, 1991; Hamilton et al., 2003; Roebuck-Spencer et al., 2004; Kodituwakku,
2007; Simmons et al., 2010; Riley et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2013; Williams et al., 2014).
Physical abnormalities include stunted growth and facial dysmorphia, while cognitive tests have
found that children diagnosed with FASD show below-average IQs, and poor performance
in complex language and arithmetic tests. Behavioral and psychological impairments include
an inability to adapt socially, hyperactivity, poor focus and attention, and numerous mental
health issues, including depression and anxiety. Strikingly, a considerable 21% of children

diagnosed with an FASD meet the criteria for anxiety disorders
(O’Connor and Paley, 2009), compared with the median
prevalence rate of 8% in normal youth populations (Merikangas
et al., 2009).
In humans, the severity of prenatal alcohol exposure
(PAE)-induced deficits are associated with the timing and
amount of alcohol exposure during gestation (O’Leary et al.,
2010). Similarly, studies using animal models of PAE have
recapitulated this concept by demonstrating differential patterns
of anxiety-like behaviors dependent on the timing of ethanol
exposure
during
fetal
development
(trimester-equivalents)
and/or the dosage of alcohol administered/consumed within
an exposure period (Marquardt and Brigman, 2016). Although
becoming increasingly more common, the number of empirical
studies utilizing lower levels of ethanol exposure are far
fewer than those which model heavy drinking behavior
(Valenzuela et al., 2012). This is problematic, as epidemiological
data suggests that moderate alcohol consumption is the
predominant drinking pattern observed in pregnant women
(Ethen et al., 2009). Research incorporating low to moderate
levels of PAE have repeatedly reported results which mirror
findings from studies of high level-PAE, including impaired
glutamatergic and GABAergic plasticity in the hippocampus,
altered neurogenesis in adulthood, downregulation of retinoic
acid levels during embryonic development, impaired motor
coordination,
increased
vulnerability
to
and
preference
for
abused
substances,
and
alterations
to
serotonergic
influence on the HPA axis (see review: Valenzuela et al.,
2012).
Despite the high prevalence of moderate drinking in pregnant
women, and the substantial proportion of the FASD population
that meets the criteria for an anxiety disorder, studies examining
the impact of moderate PAE (mPAE) on the development of
anxiety are unclear. Animal models of heavy PAE demonstrate
inconsistent effects on anxiety-like behavior (Osborn et al.,
1998a,b; Carneiro et al., 2005; Kleiber et al., 2011; He, 2014; Liang
et al., 2014), with some studies demonstrating sex-dependent
changes in anxiety-like behavior in PAE offspring (Hofmann
et al., 2002, 2005; Hellemans et al., 2010a; Mooney and
Varlinskaya, 2011; Diaz et al., 2016). Interestingly, recent studies
have identified gestational day (G) 12 as a stage in fetal
development vulnerable to high-level ethanol-induced social
anxiety-like alterations, regardless of rat strain (Mooney and
Varlinskaya, 2011; Middleton et al., 2012; Diaz et al., 2016).
Importantly, G12 corresponds with an epoch during which
the amygdala, a brain region associated with the expression of
anxiety, is undergoing significant development (Soma et al., 2009;
Charil et al., 2010).
Based on these observations, the objective of the present
study was to assess the impact of G12 mPAE on anxiety-like
behavior in exposed offspring. The appearance of anxiety
disorders is often observable in humans by adolescence in
the general population (Beesdo et al., 2009), in individuals
with FASD (O’Connor and Paley, 2009), and similarly in rats
on postnatal (P)42 following G12 heavy PAE (Mooney and
Varlinskaya, 2011; Diaz et al., 2016). Therefore, we focused
our assessment for anxiety-like behaviors during an equivalent
period of mid-to-late adolescence, in addition to one behavioral
measure in adulthood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats (P60+) were
obtained from Envigo/Harlan (Indianapolis, IN, USA) to be
bred in-house. With the exception of pregnant dams and male
breeders, who were singly housed, all animals were group-
housed. Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled
(22◦C) vivarium, and maintained on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle
(lights on at 07:00 h) with ad libitum access to food (Purina
rat chow) and water. All animal procedures were approved by
the Binghamton University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Breeding
All animals were group-housed by sex until breeding began, at
which point two viable nulliparous female rats were placed in
a cage with a single male breeder, and females were checked
daily for pregnancy for up to four total days. Vaginal smears
were collected every morning, with the first day of detectable
sperm designated as G1 (Mooney and Varlinskaya, 2011).
Once pregnancy was confirmed, females were single-housed and
continued to receive food and water ad libitum. Females were
weighed on G1, G10 and G20. After giving birth, dams were left
with their pups for 2 days, at which time pups were counted,
weighed and culled to a ratio of 5:5 males and females. Pups
were then returned to their mother until weaning at P23, at
which point they were separated by sex and group-housed with
littermates until further testing. Additional pup weights were
collected at P7 and P12; otherwise, cages were undisturbed until
weaning.
Vapor Ethanol Exposure
On G12, pregnant dams in their home cages were transferred
to vapor inhalation chambers as previously described (Morton
et al., 2014). Depending upon the experimental group, dams
were exposed to either room air (control group) or vaporized
ethanol (mPAE group) for 6 h (09:00–15:00). Dams had usual
access to food and water throughout the exposure. Dams were
not removed from their cages or handled at any time during
this procedure. At the end of the exposure, cages were removed
from vapor chambers and returned to the colony room. Food was
replaced immediately after the exposure in the ethanol-exposed
cages to avoid additional exposure to ethanol absorbed by the
food.
In order to avoid additional stress on experimental animals, a
different subset of pregnant dams was used for determination of
blood ethanol concentrations (BECs), with tail-bloods collected
every 2 h over a 12-h period. Dams were euthanized following
the last blood collection time point.
Behavior Testing
Beginning on P35, each animal was handled daily until the
behavioral testing began, in order to reduce handling stress

on day of testing. A battery of behavioral tests was performed
from P41–P47, with one male and one female from a given
litter randomly assigned to one of the following tests to avoid
litter effects. No animal performed more than one behavioral
test to avoid carryover effects from repeated testing (Doremus-
Fitzwater et al., 2009). Since the experimenter was not present in
the room during testing, all tests were video recorded for later
scoring by an experimenter blind to the assigned conditions of
each experimental animal.
Novelty-Induced Hypophagia (NIH)
Novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) is a validated test for
anxiety-like behavior induced by changes in environmental
contexts (Hunsberger and Duman, 2007; Dulawa, 2009). Rats
underwent NIH testing from P41–P47, with the training period
occurring from P41–P46, and a novelty-testing day occurring
on P47.
Training Phase
On P41, rats were removed from their home-cages and isolated
in a new standard cage (‘‘training cage’’) for 1 h, lined with
fresh bedding and access to food and water, to acclimate to the
novel environment (animals were not food or water restricted at
any point during NIH testing). After the 1-h isolation period,
a peanut butter cracker was placed in the cage. The animal’s
interactions with the cracker were video-recorded for 15 min.
After 15 min, rats were returned to their home-cages. Peanut
butter crackers were weighed before and after the experiment to
determine how much of the cracker had been consumed by the
rat (in grams). This process was repeated for the next 5 days using
the same ‘‘training cage’’ introduced on the first day.
Novelty Test
On the seventh day, rats were allowed to acclimate to their
‘‘training cage’’ for 1 h, as previously done within the training
phase. Following this acclimation period, the animal was
transferred to a novel plastic tub (58.42 cm (L) × 43.18 cm
(H) × 31.75 cm (W) with no bedding/water/food) and a peanut
butter cracker was immediately placed in the novel tub. The
animal’s interactions with the cracker in the novel environment
were video-recorded for 15 min. After 15 min, rats were returned
to their home-cages. Peanut butter crackers were weighed before
and after experimentation to determine consumption quantities,
as the amount of cracker consumed has also previously been
reported as a measure of anxiety-like behavior (Dulawa et al.,
2004; Bechtholt et al., 2007; Ueda et al., 2017).
Experimental videos were later analyzed for the time taken
by the animal to approach and begin consuming the cracker
(latency), as well as the amount of cracker consumed.
Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM)
In a different subset of animals, the EPM was performed on
P41 as a measure of anxiety-like behavior (Hunsberger and
Duman, 2007; Walf and Frye, 2007). The EPM apparatus was
elevated 50.0 cm above the floor and consisted of two open and
two closed arms, with each arm running 48.3 cm in length and
12.7 cm wide. Plastic edges (1.3 cm high) ran along each side of
the open arms to reduce the likelihood an animal would fall off
the edge. Walls surrounding the closed arms measured 29.2 cm
tall. Illumination at the entrance into the open arms was set
to ∼90 lux. On testing day, animals were socially isolated in
an unfamiliar holding cage for 1 h in a novel room in order
to increase exploration in the open arms, as previous literature
has demonstrated (Pellow et al., 1985; Doremus-Fitzwater et al.,
2009). At the beginning of testing, each subject was placed at the
center of the crossing arms, facing either open arm and permitted
to freely move within the maze for 5 min. Immediately following
placement of the rat in the maze, the experimenter left the
room for the length of the trial. Between animals, the apparatus
was cleaned with 3% hydrogen peroxide and thoroughly dried.
Measures analyzed included: % of time spent in the open and
closed arms, entries into the open and closed arms, as well as
head dips and stretch attend postures. An animal was qualified
as entering an arm when all four paws were placed in that arm.
Light-Dark Box (LDB)
In another subset of P42 animals, the light-dark box (LDB)
was performed to assess anxiety-like behaviors (Shimada et al.,
1995; Bourin and Hascoët, 2003). The apparatus consisted of
two adjoined chambers (34 × 24 × 24 cm), with a circular
aperture (8 cm diameter) between the two chambers permitting
voluntary movement between the chambers. Chambers were
divided by appearance, with white and black opaque Plexiglas.
The white section was deemed ‘‘the light box’’ and the black
section was deemed ‘‘the dark box’’. A black, non-translucent
lid covered the dark box to prevent ambient room light from
streaming in. The light box was covered by a transparent
plastic lid, which allowed room light into the apparatus. Prior
to testing, and between trials, the boxes were cleaned with
3% hydrogen peroxide and dried thoroughly. All testing was
conducted under ambient room lighting. To begin testing, an
animal was placed in the light box, facing away from the
aperture between the chambers. At this time, the researcher
left the room, and the animal was permitted to investigate the
chambers for 5 min. This 5-min period was video recorded,
and later assessed for the following measurements: time spent
in each chamber, latency to enter the dark side for the first
time (egress), latency to return to the light side for the
first time (re-entry) and the number of transitions between
chambers.
Open-Field Test (OF)
In a different subset of P43 animals, anxiety-like behaviors were
assessed using the open-field (OF; Prut and Belzung, 2003;
Hunsberger and Duman, 2007). The apparatus consisted of a
square box with a base (46-cm diameter) and walls (32-cm) made
of black plastic. Inside the box, a center square (25-cm diameter)
was outlined in red tape, providing a 10.5-cm wide space outside
the center square, adjacent to the walls. The apparatus was placed
on the floor and lit by ambient room lighting. Before and between
trials, the box was cleaned with 3% hydrogen peroxide and dried
off. To begin the trial, the subject was placed in the center square
of the OF and permitted to freely roam throughout the box
for 5 min. Video recordings were later scored for time spent

in the center square, time spent moving throughout the box
(locomotor time) and the number of entrances into the center
compartment.
Marble-Burying Test (MBT)
This test was performed on adult rats, with ages ranging
from P80–90, as a means of assessing whether demonstration
of anxiety-like behavior persisted into adulthood. Rats who
underwent the marble-burying test (MBT) were the same
rats tested in the LDB or OF as adolescents. MBT was
conducted according to established protocols (Deacon, 2006),
where 15 smooth marbles were placed in a small cage lined with
5 cm of bedding. Marbles were placed in a 3 × 5 grid design,
with 4–5 cm spacing between each marble. A subject was placed
in this cage and video-recorded for 15 min, during which time
the experimenter was absent from the room. Videos were later
scored by counting, in 5-min increments, the number of marbles
fully buried.
Statistics
Statistical analyses was performed using GraphPad 6 Software
(Prism). Based on previous reports of G12 high-dose ethanol
exposure affecting social anxiety-like behavior differently in
adolescent males and females (Diaz et al., 2016), our a priori
hypothesis was that mPAE would also differentially alter
anxiety-like behavior in males and females. Therefore, we tested
for sex differences, but also analyzed data from males and
females separately. All measures of the EPM, LDB and OF
tests were analyzed using 2 (exposure: air, ethanol) × 2 (sex:
male, female) analysis of variance (ANOVA). NIH data for
training days was analyzed using 2 (exposure) × 2 (sex) ×
2 (day) ANOVAs, with day treated as a repeated measure.
When comparing the last day of training and novelty day
for NIH, latency to consume the cracker and quantity of
cracker consumed were analyzed in a 2 × 2 ANOVA.
In the event of significant main effects or interactions,
post hoc Fishers LSD tests were used. Marble burying data
was analyzed using a 2 (exposure) × 2 (sex) ANOVA.
Significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. All data are presented
as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). A chi-square
goodness of fit test determined that the distribution of
sexes within behavioral testing was not significantly different
(X2
(3) = 11.76, p < 0.01).
RESULTS
Blood Ethanol Concentration
BECs were determined at 2-h intervals for a period of 12 h,
with exposure beginning at the 0-h mark and ending at 6 h
(Figure 1A). This exposure resulted in a peak BEC level of
87.8 ± 11.8 mg/dL (n = 3), which occurred at the 4-h mark
of exposure. These levels are consistent with previous literature
determinations of ‘‘moderate’’ PAE (Valenzuela et al., 2012).
Following termination of vapor ethanol exposure, BECs dropped
to baseline levels within 6 h.

G12 mPAE Paradigm Characterization
Several parameters were compared between exposure conditions
(control/air and mPAE/ethanol), including dam weight on G1,
G10 and G20 (Figure 1B), number of pups per litter, sex ratio
per litter, length of gestation and pup weight on P2, P7 and
P12 (Table 1). No significant differences were found between the
exposure conditions at any measure.
Novelty-Induced Hypophagia (NIH)
The NIH test began with a training/acclimation phase over
six consecutive days. Latency to approach the cracker over
successive training days was measured during the 15-min testing
period. Both air and ethanol exposed offspring demonstrated a
similar and significant decrease in latency across training days
by repeated measures ANOVA (Figures 2A,B: F(5,135) = 26.21,
p < 0.0001). However, latency to approach the cracker on
training days did not differ as a function of exposure in

FIGURE 2 | Novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH): latency to approach the cracker. Latency to approach cracker in NIH test. (A) Males and (B) females showed similar
decreases in latencies to approach cracker during training days. (C) EtOH males demonstrated significantly increased latency on novelty day relative to day 6 of
training, a difference absent in Air males; ∗p < 0.005 compared to EtOH males on day 6. (D) Air and EtOH females similarly showed increased latency on novelty day

either males (Figure 2A: F(1,28) = 2.445, p = 0.129) or females
(Figure 2B: F(1,26) = 0.127, p = 0.725).
To measure anxiety-like behavior induced by a novel
environment, we compared the latency to consume a peanut
butter cracker on novelty day to that on the previous and last
acclimation day (Day 6). Using a 2 (exposure) × 2 (testing day)
ANOVA (Figure 2C), we found that there was no significant
effect of exposure (F(1,28) = 2.445, p = 0.129) or interaction
(F(1,28) = 1.237, p = 0.276). However, there was a significant
effect of testing day (F(1,28) = 10.34, p = 0.003). Fisher’s LSD tests
revealed a significant delay in approach to the cracker in mPAE
males from Day 6 to novelty day (n = 7, p < 0.005), where no
significant delay was seen in control males (n = 8, p = 0.148).
Similar to males, a 2 (exposure) × 2 (testing day) ANOVA
from latencies in females showed that there was no significant
effect of exposure (F(1,26) = 0.127, p = 0.725) or an interaction
(F(1,26) = 0.002, p = 0.966). There was a significant effect of
testing day for latency (F(1,26) = 15.86, p = 0.0005); however,
both groups were found to similarly increase from Day 6 to
novelty day (Figure 2D). Fisher’s LSD tests revealed significant
increases in approach latency between control females from Day
6 to novelty day (n = 8, p = 0.011) as well as in mPAE females
(n = 8, p = 0.008).
Since amount of food eaten can also indicate changes in
anxiety-like behavior, we also analyzed amount of cracker
consumption during this test. We found that quantity of cracker

eaten significantly increased across training days similarly in
both males and females using a repeated measures ANOVA,
regardless of prenatal exposure (Figures 3A,B: F(5,135) = 63.65,
p < 0.0001). There was also a main effect of exposure on cracker
consumption on training days with EtOH animals consuming
significantly less than air animals (F(1,27) = 5.165, p = 0.031).
As with latency, based on our a priori hypothesis, when
examining the difference in cracker consumption between the
last training day and the novelty day, we found no effect of
exposure (F(1,28) = 1.613, p = 0.214), day (F(1,28) = 0.988,
p = 0.328), or interaction (F(1,28) = 0.473, p = 0.497) in males
(Figure 3C). In females (Figure 3D), while we found no effect
of exposure (F(1,26) = 1.585, p = 0.219) or an interaction
(F(1,26) = 0.297, p = 0.591), there was a significant effect of day
(F(1,26) = 14.71, p = 0.0007). Fisher LSD tests showed a significant
decrease in cracker consumption from Day 6 to novelty day in
both controls (p = 0.006) and mPAE females (p = 0.023).
Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM)
Evaluation of anxiety-like responses using the EPM revealed no
significant main effects of exposure (F(1,32) = 0.053, p = 0.819)
or sex (F(1,32) = 2.585, p = 0.118), nor a significant interaction
of these effects (F(1,32) = 0.446, p = 0.509) for % of time spent
in the open and closed arms. In regard to open arm entries, no
significant effect of exposure was found (F(1,32) = 0.015, p = 0.904)
nor an interaction between treatment and sex (F(1,32) = 0.730,
p = 0.400). However, a significant effect of sex was found
F(1,32) = 5.373, p = 0.027), and post hoc comparisons revealed
this effect was significant only between males and females in
the ethanol group (t = 2.243, n = 9, p = 0.032), but not the
control group (t = 1.035, n = 9, p = 0.308). Additionally, no
significant differences were found within any other measure of
this test: closed arm entries (Exposure: F(1,32) = 0.290, p = 0.594;
Sex: F(1,32) = 0.185, p = 0.670, Interaction: F(1,32) = 1.159,
p = 0.290), stretch attends (Exposure: F(1,27) = 0.274, p = 0.605;
Sex: F(1,27) = 0.001, p = 0.972, Interaction: F(1,27) = 0.023,
p = 0.881) and head dips (Exposure: F(1,27) = 1.01, p = 0.324; Sex:
F(1,27) = 2.706, p = 0.112, Interaction: F(1,27) = 1.390, p = 0.247;

Light-Dark Box (LDB)
In the LDB test, there were no main effects of exposure
(F(1,30) = 0.245, p = 0.624) or sex (F(1,30) = 1.463, p = 0.236) on
time spent in the light side of the chamber. However, there was a
significant interaction between the two variables (F(1,30) = 5.184,
p = 0.030; Figure 4B). Post hoc LSD tests revealed the only

comparison which differed significantly was between ethanol-
exposed males and females (n = 7–9, p = 0.024). Neither males
(n = 7–8, p > 0.232) nor females (n = 9, p = 0.051) differed across
exposure, although there was a trend in females, with ethanol-
exposed females spending more time in the light side of the
chamber than air-exposed females. In measures of egress latency,
there was a significant interaction (F(1,30) = 7.019, p = 0.013) with
no main effects of treatment (F(1,30) = 0.110, p = 0.743) or sex
(F(1,30) = 0.088, p = 0.769; Figure 4A). Post hoc comparisons
revealed that the only groups which varied significantly were
air and ethanol-exposed males, with ethanol exposed males
demonstrating significantly lower egress latencies than controls
(n = 7–9, p = 0.050). Although not statistically significant, there
was a trend toward a difference between ethanol-exposed males
and females at p = 0.0527 (n = 7–9). In regard to re-entry latency,
no significant effects of exposure (F(1,30) = 0.017, p = 0.897) or sex
(F(1,30) = 0.679, p = 0.417) were found, nor an interaction between
the two variables (F(1,30) = 1.638, p = 0.210; Figure 4C). Similarly,
there was no significant effect of exposure (F(1,30) = 0.220,
p = 0.643), sex (F(1,30) = 3.895, p = 0.058) or an interaction of the
independent variables (F(1,30) = 1.465, p = 0.236) in transitions
(Figure 4D).

there was a significant effect of sex (F(1,31) = 4.453, p = 0.043),
with no interaction between the variables (F(1,31) = 0.072,
p = 0.791; Figure 5A). However, post hoc LSD revealed
no significant differences in comparisons across exposures
in either males (n = 9, p = 0.646) or females (n = 8–9,
p = 0.939). In center entries, there was a significant sex
effect (F(1,31) = 6.14, p = 0.019), with no effect of exposure
(F(1,31) = 0.683, p = 0.415) or an interaction (F(1,31) = 3.526,
p = 0.070; Figure 5B). While post hoc tests revealed no significant
differences across exposure in females (n = 8–9, p = 0.469),
ethanol-exposed males demonstrated fewer entrances into the
center than controls, although this did not reach significance
(n = 9, p = 0.061). Additionally, ethanol-exposed animals did
differ significantly as a function of sex (n = 9, p = 0.003).
As a separate measure, we assessed locomotor activity by
analyzing the amount of time spent moving throughout the
OF apparatus (including both time moving in the periphery
and in the center). Surprisingly, we found a significant effect
of exposure in this measure (F(1,31) = 7.497, p = 0.010), with
no effect of sex (F(1,31) = 0.010, p = 0.919) or an interaction
(F(1,31) = 0.246, p = 0.624). Post hoc tests revealed that ethanol-
exposed males spent significantly less time moving throughout
the OF than control males (n = 9, p = 0.027), a difference
absent in females across exposure (n = 8–9, p = 0.128;
Figure 5C).
Marble Burying Test (MBT)
To assess persistent changes in anxiety-like behavior into
adulthood, we tested offspring who had previously undergone
LDB or OF tests in in the MBT. Since we utilized animals that had
undergone LDB and OF testing for the MBT, in order to continue
using a litter as the unit of determination (n = 1), we averaged
data from same-sex siblings. A 2 (sex) × 2 (exposure) ANOVA
revealed a significant sex effect (F(1,12) = 7.638, p = 0.017), with
no significant effect of exposure (F(1,12) = 2.750, p = 0.123) or
an interaction (F(1,12) = 2.453, p = 0.143). However, Fishers LSD
test found a significant difference in # of marbles buried in males
(p = 0.041), indicating that mPAE males buried significantly
fewer marbles than controls (Figure 6). There was no difference
in females (p = 0.949).
DISCUSSION
Our study aimed to investigate the influence of G12 mPAE
on expression of anxiety-like behaviors in adolescent offspring.
Under a model of mPAE utilizing vaporized ethanol exposure
on G12, in which BECs gradually increased, male adolescent
offspring demonstrated increased anxiety-like behavior in three
out of four behavioral assays, whereas females did not show
mPAE-associated anxiety-like alterations across any test. In
adulthood, mPAE male offspring demonstrated a decrease in

anxiety-like responses in the MBT, a difference absent in adult
females.
Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either room
air or vaporized ethanol for 6 h, resulting in average peak
BECs of ∼87 mg/dL, consistent with a model of moderate
exposure (Valenzuela et al., 2012). One important factor of
using this route of administration is that the rise in BECs
is gradual, indicated by the peak BECs following 4 h of
vapor ethanol exposure. This is representative of individuals
who pace themselves while drinking alcohol. Importantly,
this gradual rise in BECs is unattainable through a single
instance of intraperitoneal injection, intragastric administration
of ethanol, voluntary ethanol drinking, or forced liquid ethanol
diet. Unlike high-level ethanol exposure studies, which have
found underdevelopment in ethanol-exposed pups (Dursun
et al., 2006; Brocardo et al., 2012; Ávila et al., 2016; Huebner
et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016), G12 mPAE did not produce
significant phenotypic differences in litter characteristics and
pup weights. This is consistent with previous studies of acute
heavy PAE on G12, which also found no effect of exposure
on litter characteristics (Diaz et al., 2016). However, it is
worth noting that alterations in litter characteristics and pup
weight are suggested to be dose- and exposure time-dependent
(Abel, 1996; Marquardt and Brigman, 2016). Additionally,
although it is unknown whether this vapor exposure alters
caloric intake in the pregnant dams, dam weight gain was
not significantly affected by the exposure at the end of
gestation (G20).
Another important consideration regarding our mPAE
model is the presence of sex differences. Many studies
have shown that PAE can result in sex-related impairments,
but many variables must be considered, including dose of
ethanol, timing of exposure, age of testing and the measured
outcome. Specifically, with ethanol exposure on G12, sex-specific
anxiogenic social deficits have been reported in offspring
following high level-exposure (Diaz et al., 2016), with both
sexes demonstrating significantly reduced social behaviors as
a result of PAE in Sprague-Dawley rats. However, this effect
differed between sexes depending upon the age at which
subjects were tested, with males showing increased social
anxiety as early-adolescents, while females exhibiting social
anxiety as late-adolescents and adults. In contrast, although
Mooney and Varlinskaya (2011) found increases in social
anxiety-like alterations following G12 exposure in both sexes
in Long Evans rats, these alterations were more pronounced in
males than females. Interestingly, only females showed social
anxiety-like alterations as adults when exposure occurred on G15
(Varlinskaya and Mooney, 2014), whereas both adolescent males
and females showed decreased levels of social anxiety relative
to controls, indexed via increased social investigation, when
ethanol exposure occurred on G7 (Mooney and Varlinskaya,
2011).
In the present study, however, we found that anxiogenic
effects of G12 mPAE were predominantly expressed in male
offspring when tested as mid-to-late adolescents. This suggests
that females may be more resilient to the effects of ethanol
exposure during the beginning of the 2nd trimester-equivalent,
although this resiliency may be overcome by higher doses
of ethanol (Diaz et al., 2016). Interestingly, although not
anticipated, under three different behavioral tests, we observed
a sex difference in ethanol-exposed animals that was not present
in air-exposed groups. Although direct comparisons to control
animals within sex did not reach significance, egress latency and
light time in the LDB, as well as center entries in the OF revealed a
pattern of behavior in which males showed increased anxiety-like
behavior following mPAE, and mPAE females demonstrate the
opposite effect, inclining toward reduced anxiety-like behavior.
This significant difference between ethanol males and females
was further seen in open arm entries of the EPM. Together,
this data appends research suggestive of differential effects of
alcohol on sexes, and highlights the importance of looking
at both sexes in research involving prenatal exposure to
ethanol.
Males demonstrated increased anxiety-like behavior on the
NIH test following mPAE. Specifically, when comparing latency
to approach cracker on the last day of training and the
novelty testing day, mPAE males exhibited a significantly longer
delay in approaching the cracker in a novel environment
relative to the final training day, and this was not observed in
control animals. In female offspring, both control and mPAE
groups showed significant increases in latency to approach
the cracker. These findings suggest that in mPAE males,
the unfamiliar environment is anxiety-provoking, even after
becoming familiarized to the stimulus. Conversely, in females,
exposure to a novel environment equally induces anxiety
regardless of prenatal treatment. Based on these findings,
it is possible that there was a ceiling effect in females,
however, this will have to be further assessed in the future.
Nevertheless, these data suggest that anxiety-like behavior across
sexes may vary depending upon the task/event that induces
anxiety.
Behavioral deficits in mPAE males were also observed in
the LDB through egress latency (the first transition from the
light to dark compartment), but in no other LDB measure.
These data suggest that in the presence of an aversive, high-lit
environment, mPAE males were much quicker to leave the

G12 mPAE and Anxiety
anxiety-inducing environment than controls. Surprisingly we
did not find a difference in time spent in the light, which is
the more typically reported measure of anxiety-like behavior
in the LDB. It is possible that our test was too anxiogenic
as control animals spent only ∼10% of the time in the light
side, which is significantly lower than control animals seen in
other studies utilizing the LDB as a measure of anxiety-like
behavior (Slawecki, 2005; Kupferschmidt et al., 2010; Arrant
et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2016). Nevertheless, although not
significant, mPAE males did show a reduction in light time. One
potential reason for why this effect was not more dramatic is
because animals did not undergo a habituation period for this
test as compared to the training phase of the NIH. However,
animals were handled for a week prior to testing to avoid
additional handling stress that could have influenced behavior
in this test. Interestingly, in another subset of animals that
were unhandled prior to LDB testing, we found much higher
variability in all measures (data not shown), suggesting that
handling profoundly influences behavior in this task. Regardless,
the difference in egress latency in mPAE males was significant,
consistent with the observed anxiety-like behavior seen in
the NIH.
Increased anxiety-like behavior was evident in mPAE males
when tested in the OF. The OF is an established test of
anxiety-like behavior that relies on the assumption that anxious
animals spend significantly less time in the center square
and more time near the walls in the outer compartment
(Carter and Shieh, 2015). Furthermore, anxious animals
demonstrate less exploratory behavior, including transitioning
between and moving throughout compartments. Although
we observed no differences in time spent in the center
across groups, mPAE males showed reduced center entries
relative to controls (although this did not reach statistical
significance). One factor that must be considered with this
OF test is locomotor behavior, which has been shown to
be altered by PAE (Brys et al., 2014; Skorput et al., 2015;
Muñoz-Villegas et al., 2017). Analysis of the time each
group spent moving throughout the OF apparatus (locomotor
time) revealed a significant decrease in locomotor activity in
mPAE males relative to control males. This effect was not
seen nor expected in females, as prenatal exposure did not
produce differences in either center-time or center entries
for females. While these results are consistent with previous
observations associating hypolocomotion with an anxiogenic
phenotype (Bagdy et al., 2001), it is difficult to fully attribute
the reduced center entries to hypolocomotion, as we did
not examine distance moved. Additional assessment should
include distance moved to determine the extent of the observed
hypolocomotor activity. Interestingly, although most studies
indicate that PAE increases locomotor activity (Brys et al.,
2014; Skorput et al., 2015; Muñoz-Villegas et al., 2017),
there is research that has demonstrated decreased locomotor
activity following PAE as well (Elibol-Can et al., 2014). Future
studies should better examine the influence of G12 mPAE
on locomotor activity and the relationship between locomotor
activity and anxiety-like behaviors, particularly in the context
of PAE.
In contrast to the previous tests of anxiety-like behavior,
we found no differences in anxiety-like behavior across
exposure conditions in the EPM. Previous research of heavy
PAE has produced conflicting results within this test: one
study in adolescent mice failed to find an anxiety-altering
effect of high level-ethanol exposure throughout gestation on
EPM performance (Boehm et al., 2008). In a study utilizing
Sprague-Dawley rats, an effect of prenatal exposure was only
observed in the presence of PAE combined with chronic
mild stress, but not in PAE alone (Hellemans et al., 2010b).
Two studies which assessed prolonged mPAE throughout
gestation uncovered contradictory results in the EPM: an
anxiogenic effect in Sprague-Dawley rats (Cullen et al.,
2013) and no effect in offspring of Wistar rats (Barbaccia
et al., 2007). Furthermore, when ethanol exposure occurred
during the 3rd trimester-equivalent, anxiety-like behavior of
adolescents in the EPM was only observed following brief
high level-exposure (P3–5; Baculis et al., 2015), but not
prolonged and moderate exposure (P2–12; Diaz et al., 2014).
Together, these findings imply that the efficiency of the
EPM as a measure of PAE-induced anxiety-like behavior is
complex. Another interpretation of our results, whereupon
the expression of anxiogenic behavior appears in only three
of four behavioral assays, is that mPAE-induced anxiety
may express itself in a context-dependent manner. It is
worth mentioning that the limits of the EPM as a measure
of anxiety-like behavior may be attributable to the form
of anxiety it empirically measures: a situation-dependent
anxiety/fear, as opposed to generalized anxiety behaviors
(Falter et al., 1992). Therefore, our findings may suggest that
G12 mPAE is somewhat specific in the forms of anxiety it can
induce.
In addition to the effects observed in adolescent animals,
we were also interested in determining whether anxiogenic
behavior persevered into adulthood, as it has been suggested
that PAE also increases the likelihood for development of
anxiety symptomology in adults (Steinhausen and Spohr, 1998;
Hellemans et al., 2010b; He, 2014). Surprisingly, we discovered
a reversal of anxiety in mPAE male animals in adulthood
wherein adult males (who as adolescents demonstrated increased
anxiety in the LDB and OF) now showed significantly less
anxiety (burying of less marbles) than their control counterparts.
This was unexpected, as previous research into the effects of
PAE on generalized anxiety in adult animals has repeatedly
revealed significant increases in anxiety-like behavior (Zhou
et al., 2010; Cullen et al., 2013; Elibol-Can et al., 2014). However,
there are some studies which have contradicted these reports,
finding either a complete lack of an effect (Sanchez Vega
et al., 2013) or a very mild behavioral effect (Dursun et al.,
2006). Overall, there seems to be a great deal of uncertainty
within this body of literature as to the long-term impact
of PAE. However, we previously found that G12 high level-
exposure produces similar decreases in anxiety-like behavior
in the EPM of adults that show increased social anxiety-like
behavior at that same age (Diaz et al., 2016). Within our
own results, one potential explanation for this shift is that
compensatory adaptations may be engaged from adolescence

G12 mPAE and Anxiety
into adulthood, which over-correct for anxiety and results in
an opposite, yet inappropriate anxiety-like response. It is also
important to note that the MBT may not directly measure
anxiety-like behaviors, as some have defined it more as a
measure of obsessive-compulsive and perseverative behavior
than anxiety-like behavior (Takeuchi et al., 2002; Thomas et al.,
2009).
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that G12 mPAE
produces
anxiogenic
responses
in
male
offspring
during
adolescence, but not in adulthood. Surprisingly, this exposure
produces no effect in female offspring at either age. Studies
are warranted to identify neurobiological mechanisms associated
with the age-dependent expression of anxiety-like behaviors in
males and resilience in females which may be altered by exposure
during this gestational period.
