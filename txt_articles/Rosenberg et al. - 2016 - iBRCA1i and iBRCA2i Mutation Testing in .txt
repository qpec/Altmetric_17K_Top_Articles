IMPORTANCE BRCA testing is recommended for young women diagnosed as having breast
cancer, but little is known about decisions surrounding testing and how results may influence
treatment decisions in young patients.
OBJECTIVES To describe the use of BRCA testing and to evaluate how concerns about genetic
risk and use of genetic information affect subsequent treatment decisions in young women
with breast cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional analysis of data collected following the
opening of the study to accrual from October 10, 2006, through December 31, 2014, as part
of the Helping Ourselves, Helping Others: Young Women’s Breast Cancer Study, an ongoing
prospective cohort study. Study participants included 897 women aged 40 years and
younger at breast cancer diagnosis from 11 academic and community medical centers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency and trends in the use of BRCA testing and how
genetic information is used to make treatment decisions among women who test positive vs
negative for a BRCA mutation.
RESULTS A total of 780 (87.0%) of 897 women reported BRCA testing by 1 year after breast
cancer diagnosis (mean age at diagnosis, 35.3 vs 36.9 years for untested women; P < .001),
with the frequency of testing increasing among women diagnosed from August 1, 2006,
through December 31, 2013. Of 39 women who were diagnosed as having breast cancer in
2006, 30 (76.9%) reported testing. In 2007, a slightly lower percentage of women (87 of 124
[70.2%]) reported testing; however, the proportion tested increased each subsequent year,
with 141 (96.6%) of 146 and 123 (95.3%) of 129 women diagnosed as having breast cancer in
2012 and 2013, respectively, reporting BRCA testing (P < .001). Among untested women, 37
(31.6%) of 117 did not report discussion of the possibility that they might have a mutation with
a physician and/or genetic counselor, and 43 (36.8%) of 117 were thinking of testing in the
future. A total of 248 (29.8%) of 831 women said that knowledge or concern about genetic
risk influenced treatment decisions; among these women, 76 (86.4%) of 88 mutation carriers
and 82 (51.2%) of 160 noncarriers chose bilateral mastectomy (P < .001). Fewer women
reported that systemic treatment decisions were influenced by genetic risk concern.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Rates of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing are increasing in
young women with breast cancer. Given that knowledge and concern about genetic risk
influence surgical decisions and may affect systemic therapy trial eligibility, all young women
with breast cancer should be counseled and offered genetic testing, consistent with the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

reast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in
women younger than 40 years in the United States.1 Be-
causeBRCA1(OMIM113705)andBRCA2(OMIM600185)
mutation carriers are at increased risk for developing early-
onset breast cancer, the National Comprehensive Cancer Net-
work (NCCN) guidelines recommend that women diagnosed
as having breast cancer at 50 years or younger undergo ge-
netic testing.2
Assessment of genetic risk in young women after a breast
cancer diagnosis can have implications for subsequent clinical
treatment decisions. In 1 study,3 the 10-year cumulative risk of
developing a new cancer in BRCA carriers first diagnosed with
breast cancer at 30 to 34 years of age was 30.7% and in women
35 to 39 years of age was 23.7%. In addition to consideration of
prophylactic mastectomy, breast cancer survivors with a BRCA
mutation can be presented with information about other risk-
reducing strategies, including bilateral salpingo-oophorec-
tomy, which reduces the risk of new primary breast cancer and
ovarian cancer, and chemoprevention. Breast cancer survi-
vors are also candidates for increased surveillance options for
breast and ovarian cancer, including annual breast magnetic
resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasonography.2 Ge-
netic findings can also have implications for family members

Prior studies4-6 have documented underuse of BRCA test-
ing among younger women with breast cancer, although the
figures have improved with time. In 1 study4 that surveyed
women diagnosed as having breast cancer at 45 years and
younger between 1993 and 2002, less than 20% had under-
gone BRCA testing. In an analysis5 of 701 women who had been

of more than 300 women with breast cancer at 50 years and
younger who were treated at NCCN institutions, 34.1% were

In an effort to characterize experiences surrounding ge-
netic testing among young women with breast cancer, we

CancerStudy(YWS)isanongoing,multicenter,prospectiveco-
hort study established to examine biological, medical, and
quality-of-life issues in young women diagnosed as having
breast cancer at 40 years and younger. Women are identified
through review of pathology reports or staff review of clinic
lists depending on the study site. Eligible patients are mailed
a recruitment package that includes a letter introducing the
study, 2 copies of the consent form, and a decline form. Pa-
tients who have not returned their consent or decline form are
contacted by telephone within 3 weeks to inquire about their
interest in study participation and are re-sent recruitment ma-
terials as needed. Patients who send in their signed informed
consent forms are officially enrolled in the study. After writ-
ten informed consent and enrollment, women are mailed a
baseline survey (median, 4.8 months after diagnosis), addi-
tional surveys twice a year for the first 3 years after diagnosis,
and annually thereafter. The YWS sites include 9 academic and
community hospitals in Massachusetts and academic sites in
Denver, Colorado, Rochester, Minnesota, and Toronto, On-
tario, Canada, although Toronto participants received a modi-
fied version of all the surveys and were not included in this
analysis. Women who enrolled in the YWS after the opening
of the study to accrual on October 10, 2006, and completed
the survey mailed to study participants at 1 year after diagno-
sis (n = 911), which includes a series of questions about BRCA
testing through December 31, 2014, were eligible for inclu-
sion in this analysis (Figure 1). The YWS is approved by the in-
stitutional review board at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer

Key Points
Question: How does BRCA testing affect treatment decisions of
women diagnosed as having breast cancer at 40 years and
younger?
Findings: This BRCA testing frequency increased among women
diagnosed between 2006 and 2013; 248 (29.8%) of 831 women
said that knowledge or concern about genetic risk influenced
treatment decisions.
Meaning: BRCA testing has been increasing in young women with
breast cancer, with concern about genetic risk, even in women
who tested negative, influencing surgical decisions.

Center and other participating sites (Newton-Wellesley Hos-
pital, Mayo Clinic, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, and
University of Colorado Cancer Center).
Outcome Measures
Study population characteristics included age at diagnosis,
race/ethnicity (assessed with 2 survey items that ask respon-
dentswhethertheyconsiderthemselvesHispanicorLatinaand
what race they consider themselves, with the option to choose
1 or more prespecified racial groups, including American In-
dian or Alaskan Native, Asian, black, Haitian or African Ameri-
can, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or white), mari-
tal status, educational level, and insurance status. Pathology
reports and medical records were reviewed for stage of dis-
ease, hormone receptor status, and ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or
HER2/neu) status. A single item on the baseline survey asks
women whether any grandparent was of Ashkenazi descent.
Family history of breast and ovarian cancer is collected on the
survey administered 1 year after diagnosis.
AseriesofitemsassessingpracticessurroundingBRCAtest-
ing were developed and included in the 1-year survey. Women
were asked whether they had their blood sent to be tested for
a genetic change (a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene) that
increases risk of breast cancer. Women who said that they had
undergone testing were asked for the results, and response op-
tionsincludedthefollowing:noabnormalitydetectedinBRCA1
or BRCA2/no mutation detected; deleterious gene alteration/
mutation was detected in BRCA1; deleterious gene alteration/
mutation was detected in BRCA2; deleterious gene alteration/
mutation was detected, but I am not sure whether it was in
BRCA1 or BRCA2; an indeterminate or unknown variant was
detected (an abnormality that is not known to contribute to
breast cancer risk); results not yet available; or I am not sure
what genetic testing showed. Women were also asked to ap-
proximate how long after diagnosis they received their re-
sults (<1 month, 1-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, or >12
months).
Women who said they had not undergone testing or were
unsure whether they were tested were asked a series of ques-
tions, including whether they discussed the possibility of hav-
ing a genetic mutation with their physician(s), whether they
were counseled about the likelihood of having a genetic pre-
dispositiontodevelopbreastcancerandtheimplicationsofpo-
tentially having one of these gene mutations on future health
and treatment, and reasons why they have not been tested.
All women (tested and untested) were asked whether
knowledge or concern about genetic risk of breast cancer (in-
cluding whether testing revealed a deleterious BRCA muta-
tion) influenced treatment decisions. Multiple responses were
allowed, and response options included the following: no; yes,
I chose to have the breast where I have developed cancer re-
moved (mastectomy) rather than have a lumpectomy; yes, I
chose to have both breasts removed (bilateral mastectomy);
yes, I chose to have my ovaries removed; yes, I chose to have
1 or more of the following treatments that I might not have oth-
erwise taken: tamoxifen citrate; aromatase inhibitor (eg, an-
astrozole, letrozole, exemestane); ovarian suppression with
medication (eg, leuprolide acetate, triptorelin pamoate, or gos-
erelin acetate); chemotherapy; or other (this option was open-
ended, and women could write in other ways in which knowl-
edge or concern about genetic risk had influenced their
treatment decisions).
Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to characterize the study popu-
lation, BRCA testing use, and timing of receipt of testing re-
sults and, among untested women, to describe whether
genetic risk was discussed with a physician and/or genetic
counselor and the reasons for not undergoing testing. To check
for changes in BRCA testing over time, we used the Cochran-
Armitage test for trend. We used unpaired, 2-tailed t tests and
Fisher exact tests to assess differences in study population
characteristics among women who were and were not tested
and to evaluate how genetic information was used to make
treatment decisions among women who tested positive for
a BRCA mutation and women who tested negative. The re-
sponses of women who answered “other” to how genetic in-
formation was used in treatment decisions were examined
qualitatively, and the most frequently cited reasons (chose
lumpectomy, chose mastectomy, and chose not to have bilat-
eral mastectomy) were collapsed and summarized. Women
who responded that they were unsure about testing or did not
respond to this question but answered the question asking for
their test results were recoded as being tested; those who did
not subsequently answer the question about their results
(n = 14) were excluded, leaving 897 women in the analytic
sample. Sample sizes vary somewhat across analyses owing
to nonresponse or discordant responses on specific items. A
2-sided P ≤ .05 was used as the threshold for statistical signifi-
cance. Analyses were conducted with SAS statistical soft-
ware, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Study population characteristics are detailed in eTable 1 in the
Supplement. Mean age at diagnosis among women who were
tested was younger than that of untested women (35.3 vs 36.9
years, P < .001). Among women for whom stage of disease was
available,mosthadstageI(294[35.0%])orstageII(339[40.3%])
disease. Most women had at least a college education (726
[84.5%]) and were insured (851 [99.8%]). Among the women
whoweretested,ahigherproportionofwomenreportedatleast
1 second- or third-degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer
(404 [52.2%]) compared with women who were not tested (45
[38.5%]); other study population characteristics were similar
between tested and untested women.
A total of 780 women (87.0%) reported being tested for a
BRCA mutation, and only 117 (13.0%) of 897 had not under-
gone testing for a BRCA mutation when surveyed 1 year after
diagnosis. Figure 2 details BRCA test use by year of diagnosis.
Of the 39 women who were diagnosed as having breast can-
cer in 2006, 30 (76.9%) reported testing. In 2007, a slightly
lower percentage of women (87 of 124 [70.2%]) reported test-
ing; however, the proportion tested increased each subse-
quent year (Cochran-Armitage test for trend, P < .001), with

141 (96.6%) of 146 and 123 (95.3%) of 129 women diagnosed
as having breast cancer in 2012 and 2013, respectively, report-
ing BRCA testing.
Among the 780 women who had undergone BRCA testing,
59 (7.6%) reported a BRCA1 mutation, 35 (4.5%) reported a
BRCA2mutation,35(4.6%)reportedanindeterminateresultor
variant of unknown clinical significance, and 634 (81.3%) re-
ported a negative test result (Table 1). Among the 754 women
who responded regarding timing of return of BRCA results af-
ter diagnosis, 277 (36.7%) said they had received their results
less than 1 month after diagnosis, 339 (45.0%) 1 to 3 months
after diagnosis, and 78 (10.3%) 3 to 6 months after diagnosis.
Among the 117 women who were not tested, 80 (68.4%)
said they had discussed or were counseled about the possibil-
ity of having a BRCA mutation or genetic predisposition to
breast cancer with their physician and/or genetic counselor.
Of the 37 women who did not report discussion of these is-
sues with a physician and/or genetic counselor, 7 (18.9%) said
they were planning to discuss this in the future, 8 (21.6%) were
considering a future discussion, 11 (29.7%) were not sure
whether they wanted to discuss this in the future, 1 person re-
sponded that she was considering but also was not sure she
wanted to discuss this in the future, 5 (13.5%) were not inter-
ested in discussing these issues, and 5 (13.5%) did not re-
spond to this question.
The reasons women cited for not undergoing testing are
included in eTable2 in the Supplement. A total of 28 (23.9%)
women said they did not think they were at risk for having a
mutation, with a similar proportion reporting that they were
not tested because their physician thought it was unlikely they
had a mutation. Other common reasons for not undergoing
testingincludednotbeingapriority(21[17.9%]),concernsabout
potential insurance or work issues related to a positive test re-
sult (15 [12.8%]), and inability to afford to undergo testing (13
[11.1%]). A total of 43 untested women (36.8%) said they were
thinking about getting tested in the future.
A total of 248 (29.8%) of 831 patients who were tested and
reported a positive or negative result responded that knowl-
edge or concern about genetic risk of breast cancer influ-
enced their treatment in some way. Among these women, 76
(86.4%) mutation carriers and 82 (51.2%) noncarriers chose a
bilateral mastectomy (P < .001) (Table 2). Mutation carriers
were also more likely (P < .001) to have undergone a salpingo-
oophorectomy (47 [53.4%]) compared with noncarriers
(4 [2.5%]).
Fewer women reported that systemic treatment decisions
were influenced by genetic risk concern, and no significant dif-
ferences were found between carriers and noncarriers regard-
ing the effect of genetic concerns on choosing chemotherapy,
ovarian suppression, or endocrine treatment. Of the 65 women
who cited other as the reason for how knowledge or concern
about genetic risk influenced their treatment, 40 (61.5%) re-
sponded that they chose lumpectomy or mastectomy or chose
not to undergo a bilateral mastectomy.
Discussion
With 780 women (87.0%) having been tested for a BRCA mu-
tation, the use of testing in our cohort of young women far ex-
ceeds the prevalence of testing reported in several other
studies4,5,7 of women with early-onset breast cancer. Since the
YWSbeganenrollingwomenin2006,theproportionofwomen
who underwent testing increased, with almost all women di-
agnosed as having breast cancer in 2012 and 2013 reporting
BRCA testing when surveyed at 1 year after diagnosis. The high
frequency of BRCA testing likely reflects the fact that most
women enrolled in our cohort were insured, educated, and
treated at cancer centers where comprehensive genetic coun-
seling and testing services are widely available. Secular trends
in genetic testing are one explanation of the increase in BRCA
testing we detected. Of the women who did not undergo test-
ing,37saidthattheyhadnotdiscussedthepossibilitythatthey
might have a mutation with their physician and/or genetic
counselor. Media attention to hereditary breast cancer risk (eg,
theAngelinaJolieeffect)8mighthavemadewomenmorelikely
to bring up the issue of genetic risk with their physician and/or
genetic counselor, possibly leading to more testing of women

who were diagnosed as having breast cancer in 2012 and 2013
relative to earlier years (2006-2011). In an analysis of referral
patterns to a group of high-risk hereditary cancer clinics in En-
gland, Evans et al9 reported that referrals for genetic counsel-
ingandBRCAtestingincreasedsubstantiallybetween2012and
2013. A Canadian study10 described a similar notable in-
crease in counseling and testing when comparing referral pat-
terns in the 6 months before the Jolie article8 was published
to the 6-month period after publication.
Amongthewomeninourstudywhowerenottested,some
might not have initially chosen testing because of more im-
mediate concerns or prioritization of other decisions related
to treatment. It is important to consider that the decision to
undergo testing and process information about genetic risk in
women with a recent breast cancer diagnosis occurs when
women are already under stress about the decisions they need
to make pertaining to treatment. In a prior study by Weitzel
et al,11 3 women who were candidates chose not to be tested
because of distress related to their recent diagnosis. In a small
study12 of 26 patients with breast cancer from the Nether-
lands who had undergone rapid genetic counseling and (op-
tional) testing, more than half of women responded that rapid
genetic counseling and testing were associated with added dis-
tress, separate from the distress they experienced as a result
of their diagnosis. In a qualitative study conducted by Zillia-
cusetal,13interviewswithwomenwhowerediagnosedashav-
ing breast cancer at 50 years and younger revealed that, al-
thoughsomewomenacknowledgethatanxietyassociatedwith
not knowing what their test results were during a challenging
time was a downside, many women also viewed handling “all
bad news” at once and negotiating the emotions of these mul-
tiple challenges at a single time point as a positive. Further-
more, women also valued the potential for genetic testing to
inform surgical choice. Conveying the importance of testing
in the context of the decisions they are making regarding their
primary treatment, while ensuring that women are sup-
ported and concerns about genetic risk and testing are ad-
equately addressed, is essential.
Many women who were tested knew the results of their
BRCA test within 1 month of diagnosis and therefore likely had
this information before making their decision about surgery.
Of the women in our study who said concern about genetic risk
influenced their treatment decisions, those with a BRCA mu-
tation were more likely to choose bilateral mastectomy com-
pared with women who tested negative. Other studies of the
effect of BRCA testing on treatment decisions have similarly
found that women who test positive are more likely to un-
dergo bilateral surgery compared with women who test
negative.11,14-17 Notably, bilateral mastectomy was still rela-
tively common in our study even among noncarriers, suggest-
ing that many women might choose to remove both breasts be-
cause of worries about developing another breast cancer and
for peace of mind despite knowing they do not carry a known
BRCA mutation.18 It might also suggest a need for better com-
municationoftherelativelylowriskofcontralateralbreastcan-
cer among women who are noncarriers,3 that this risk has been
decreasing in recent years,19 and that bilateral mastectomy is
not associated with improved survival.20 Most women in our
cohort received chemotherapy; therefore, most women were
unlikely to perceive receipt of adjuvant treatment as being af-
fected by their genetic testing results. However, a previous
review21 reports that several clinical trials have used BRCA sta-
tus as a potentially prognostic factor in the neoadjuvant and
adjuvant settings. In addition, BRCA status can influence sys-
temic therapy trial eligibility. For example, poly(adenosine di-
phosphate–ribose) polymerase inhibitors are a new category
of targeted therapy that have demonstrated preliminary effi-
cacy almost exclusively in BRCA-mutated cancers.21 Regard-
ing endocrine treatment, similar proportions of women said
that concern about genetic risk influenced this treatment de-
cision. Although some data suggest a potential benefit of en-
docrine treatment in preventing contralateral breast cancer in

likely be minimal.
It is important to consider our findings in the context of
some limitations. Most women included in this analysis would

sults, there was no response option corresponding to prediag-
nosistesting.However,wewouldexpectthenumberofwomen
whowouldhaveundergonetestingbeforediagnosistobefairly
low, given our clinical experience with this population.
Given that the purpose of this analysis was to evaluate
patient perception of the experience surrounding BRCA test-
ing, we chose to use self-report of genetic test results. In a prior
analysis of a subset of the YWS cohort,18 we reviewed medi-
calrecordstoconfirmself-reportsofmutationstatusandfound
the 2 ascertainment methods to be highly concordant. Al-
thoughitisreassuringthatmostwomeninourcohortaretested
as recommended, a large proportion of these women are
treated in academic cancer center settings and almost every-
one is insured. Therefore generalizability of our findings, in-
cluding reasons for not undergoing testing and the degree to
which concerns about genetic risk affect treatment deci-
sions, might be limited.
Conclusions
Our findings highlight recent trends, experiences, and per-
spectives surrounding BRCA testing in women diagnosed as
having breast cancer at 40 years and younger. Because women
in our cohort are asked about BRCA testing in future surveys,
we will be able to assess whether those women who said they
were thinking about getting tested subsequently got tested at
a later time. Furthermore, it is possible that mutation carriers
who initially did not choose risk-reducing operations might
decide to undergo these procedures later in the survivorship
period. Longer-term follow-up may provide additional infor-
mation about the effect of testing on treatment decisions and,
ultimately, outcomes over time.
