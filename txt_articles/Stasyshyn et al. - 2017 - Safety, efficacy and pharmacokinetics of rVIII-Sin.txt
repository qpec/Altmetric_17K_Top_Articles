Essentials
• rVIII-SingleChain is a novel recombinant factor VIII
with covalently bonded heavy and light chains.
• Efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics were studied in
pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A.
• Across all prophylaxis regimens, the median annualized
spontaneous bleeding rate was 0.00.
• rVIII-SingleChain showed excellent hemostatic efficacy
and a favorable safety profile.
Summary. Background: rVIII-SingleChain
is
a
novel
B-domain truncated recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII)
comprised of covalently bonded FVIII heavy and light
chains, demonstrating a high binding affinity to von
Willebrand factor. Objectives: This phase III study inves-
tigated the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of rVIII-
SingleChain
in
previously
treated
pediatric
patients
< 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients/
Methods: Patients could be assigned to prophylaxis or on-
demand therapy by the investigator. For patients assigned
to prophylaxis, the treatment regimen and dose were
based on the bleeding phenotype. For patients receiving
on-demand therapy, dosing was guided by World Federa-
tion of Hemophilia recommendations. The primary end-
point was treatment success, defined as a rating of
‘excellent’ or ‘good’ on the investigator’s clinical assess-
ment of hemostatic efficacy for all treated bleeding
events. Results: The study enrolled 84 patients (0 to
< 6 years, n = 35; ≥ 6 to < 12 years, n = 49); 81 were
assigned to prophylaxis and three to an on-demand regi-
men. Patients accumulated a total of 5239 exposure days
(EDs), with 65 participants reaching > 50 EDs. In the 347
bleeds treated and evaluated by the investigator, hemo-
static efficacy was rated as excellent or good in 96.3%.
The median annualized spontaneous bleeding rate was
0.00 (Q1, Q3: 0.00, 2.20), and the median annualized
bleeding rate was 3.69 (Q1, Q3: 0.00, 7.20) across all pro-
phylaxis
regimens.
No
participant
developed
an
inhibitor. Conclusions: rVIII-SingleChain is a novel rFVIII
molecule showing excellent hemostatic efficacy and a favor-
able safety profile in a clinical study in children < 12 years
of age with severe hemophilia A.

Introduction
rVIII-SingleChain is a novel recombinant factor VIII
(rFVIII) in which the heavy and light chains are cova-
lently fused to achieve a single polypeptide protein. Upon
activation by thrombin, rVIII-SingleChain is indistin-
guishable from endogenous activated FVIII [1,2]. The sin-
gle-chain design results in a stable and homogenous drug

 product with an increased binding to von Willebrand fac-
tor (VWF), an attribute shown to be a key determinant
in FVIII half-life as well as a mechanism to mitigate the
risk of inhibitor development [2,3].
The increased affinity of rVIII-SingleChain to VWF
improved the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the molecule, as
shown in previous investigations in adults and adolescents
with severe hemophilia A, in which rVIII-SingleChain
demonstrated superior PK properties when compared
with those of full-length rFVIII [4]. A large study investi-
gating rVIII-SingleChain in 175 adult and adolescent
patients with 14 306 exposure days (EDs) demonstrated
excellent efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in the control of
bleeding events and in routine and surgical prophylaxis.
No patient developed an inhibitor while in the study [5].
Here, we report on the efficacy, safety and PK results
of a prospective phase III study investigating rVIII-Sin-
gleChain in children < 12 years of age with severe hemo-
philia A (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02093897).
Patients and methods
Patients
This study recruited patients with severe hemophilia A
(FVIII activity < 1%), with > 50 previous EDs to FVIII
prior to enrollment and aged between 0 and < 12 years.
Patients with a history (personal or first-grade relatives)
of FVIII inhibitors or a detectable inhibitor titer at
screening were excluded. Following the European Medici-
nes Agency guidance on the development of novel FVIII
products [6], the study aimed to recruit a minimum of 75
patients to ensure that at least 25 subjects in each age
group (0 to < 6 years and ≥ 6 to < 12 years) received 50
EDs of rVIII-SingleChain. The study was conducted in
accordance with the International Conference on Harmo-
nization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the
ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki
2008 [7]. Approval by the Institutional Review Boards
and
the
relevant
national
authorities
and
individual
written informed consent/assent were obtained prior to
enrollment.
Dosing
Patients were assigned to either
prophylaxis or
on-
demand therapy by the investigator; switching therapies
was not permitted during the study. At the investigator’s
discretion, for prophylaxis treatment, subjects received
rVIII-SingleChain at a dose of 15 to 50 IU kg�1 every
second day or two to three times per week or at a dose
and frequency determined by the investigator based on
historical FVIII dosing and available PK data. For the
treatment of breakthrough bleeds in patients on routine
prophylaxis and for the treatment of bleeds in patients
assigned to an on-demand regimen, dosing of rVIII-
SingleChain was guided by World Federation of Hemo-
philia recommendations [8]. The dose and frequency
could be adjusted during the study if necessary.
Efficacy assessments
All bleeding events in the study treated with rVIII-Single-
Chain were rated by the investigator on a 4-point rating
scale for hemostatic efficacy during the patients’ monthly
visits at the study site (every 3 months after the first
6 months on study), based on his or her clinical judgment
and informed by information provided by the patient and
documentation available in the eDiary on the number of
doses needed to control the bleed (Table 1). Ratings of
excellent or good were considered as treatment success.
The bleeding rate was calculated for all bleeds (annual-
ized bleeding rate
[ABR]), for spontaneous bleeding
events (annualized spontaneous bleeding rate [AsBR])
and for joint bleeds.
Safety assessments
Safety was assessed on the basis of the following variables:
number, type and severity of adverse events (AEs), develop-
ment of inhibitors against FVIII, development of non-inhi-
bitory
anti-drug-antibodies
(ADA)
and
anti-Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) host cell protein antibodies, vital
signs and physical examination, laboratory safety parame-
ters (hematology and biochemistry), and local tolerability at
the site of infusion assessed by the investigator and patient.
Inhibitor testing
Inhibitor tests were performed at screening, after 10–15
EDs and after 50–75 EDs (at the subsequent monthly

 visit). In addition, any subject that had an end of study
visit had a test for inhibitors at that visit, independent of
EDs. Additional tests could be triggered by the investiga-
tor at any time. All samples were assessed with the Nij-
megen assay in the central laboratory. A subject was
considered to have developed a positive inhibitor if a
sample assayed at the central laboratory using the Nijme-
gen assay yielded a result of ≥ 0.6 BU mL�1 and that
finding was confirmed in a second, independent sample.
PK assessment
A non-compartmental PK analysis of FVIII activity in
plasma was performed with and without baseline correc-
tion for the individual participant plasma FVIII activity-
vs.-time data using Model 202 for constant infusion in
WinNonlin� 6.3.0 (Phoenix Build 6.3.0.395, Pharsight
Corp., St Louis, MO, USA). Following a 4-day washout
period, blood samples for PK assessments were collected
immediately before injection and 1, 5, 10, 24 and 48 h
after injection, following the International Society of
Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommendations. FVIII
activity was measured in the blood samples using both
the chromogenic substrate (ChS) and one-stage clotting
(OS) assays. Baseline correction of FVIII activity was per-
formed by subtracting the participant’s pre-dose activity
level from the activity level obtained at each time-point
after dosing. The FVIII activity level before rVIII-Single-
Chain dosing was used as the baseline for PK assessment
of rVIII-SingleChain. Actual sampling times, doses (ac-
cording to the corresponding potency of the specific lot
numbers and the injection volumes) and duration of injec-
tion were used for calculation of PK parameters.
The potency of rVIII-SingleChain was assigned using the
ChS assay calibrated against the World Health Organiza-
tion FVIII standard. In line with other B-domain altered
FVIII products, there is a discrepancy between results of
the OS assay and the ChS assay for rVIII-SingleChain. Pre-
clinical studies and in vitro characterization confirmed the
ChS assay is most representative of the expected clinical
effectiveness, whereas the one-stage assay underestimates
the
FVIII
plasma
activity
in
patients
treated
with
rVIII-SingleChain by approximately 45–50% [9]. The PK
analysis was based on FVIII activity in plasma samples
determined with the ChS assay as described previously [4].
Statistics
Efficacy analyses were conducted in patients who received
at least one dose of rVIII-SingleChain as part of either on-
demand treatment or routine prophylaxis. The ABR was
calculated according to the following formula: (number of
treated
bleeds/efficacy
evaluation
period) 9 365.25.
Descriptive statistics for the individual ABR/AsBR included
the mean, standard deviation (SD), median and interquar-
tile range. In addition, the number of bleeds per year and
the 95% confidence interval were estimated based on a Pois-
son model to account for variations in the follow-up period.
Safety was assessed in all patients exposed to rVIII-Sin-
gleChain. The primary safety endpoint was the cumulative
incidence of inhibitor development. An exact two-sided
95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval (or one-sided
97.5% upper confidence limit) was used for estimating the
cumulative incidence of inhibitor formation.
Results
Study population
Of the 88 patients screened, 84 met the study eligibility crite-
ria (Fig. 1). Patients were enrolled at 37 sites in 19 countries
in Europe, the USA and the rest of the world. Countries
contributing > 10% of subjects per age group were Thai-
land (in both age groups), France, the Philippines (0 to
< 6 years group) and Turkey (≥ 6 to < 12 years group).
Characteristics and demographics of the 84 patients
who received rVIII-SingleChain are displayed in Table 2.
Thirty-nine study participants (0 to < 6 years, n = 20; ≥ 6
to < 12 years, n = 19) underwent a PK investigation.
Investigators assigned patients to either a prophylaxis reg-
imen (81 of 84) or to an on-demand regimen with rVIII-
SingleChain (3 of 84, Fig. 1).
Overall,
65
of
the
84 (77.4%)
patients
achieved
≥ 50 EDs to rVIII-SingleChain, with a similar proportion
in each age group achieving ≥ 50 EDs (27 out of 35
[77.1%] in the 0 to < 6 years age group and 38 out of 49
[77.6%] in the ≥ 6 to < 12 years age group). Eight (9.5%)
patients, all of whom were in the ≥ 6 to < 12 years age
group, achieved ≥ 100 EDs. Study participants accumu-
lated a total of 5239 EDs with rVIII-SingleChain, with a
median follow-up period of 5.6 months.
PK of rVIII-SingleChain
PK parameters are summarized in Table 3. The analysis of
the PK of a single intravenous (IV) dose of 50 IU kg�1
rVIII-SingleChain included 39 patients aged 1 to 11 years.
The FVIII activity profiles and the mean PK parameters
were similar between the two age groups. Clearance was
similar between age groups, with a mean clearance of
4.63 mL h�1 kg�1 in the ≥ 6 to < 12 years age group and
5.07 mL h�1 kg�1 in the 0 to < 6 years age group. Half-life
was also consistent between the two age groups, with a
mean half-life of 10.4 and 10.2 h for the 0 to < 6 years and
≥ 6 to < 12 years age groups, respectively.
rVIII-SingleChain in the control of bleeding events
A total of 347 bleeding events were treated with rVIII-
SingleChain and assessed by the investigator. Of these
347 events, 132 occurred in the on-demand arm and 215
occurred in the 80 patients in the prophylaxis arm.

 Hemostatic efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain was rated as
excellent in 296 bleeds (85.3%), good in 38 bleeds (11%)
and moderate in 12 bleeds (3.5%). One bleed was
reported as poor or no response. Thus, treatment success
(i.e. ratings of excellent or good) was 96.3% of all
assessed bleeding events (Table 4). A total of 85.9% of
the bleeding events were controlled with a single dose of
rVIII-SingleChain, 9.8% with two doses and 4.3% with
three or more doses. The median total dose used to treat
a
bleeding
event
was
27.6 IU kg�1
(range
16–
282 IU kg�1) and the median dose per injection to treat a
bleeding event was 27.3 IU kg�1 (range 16–76 IU kg�1).
rVIII-SingleChain in routine prophylaxis
Prior to enrollment in this study, 60 patients were treated
with prophylaxis and 24 received on-demand therapy. A
comparison of previous and end-of-study treatment regi-
mens for prophylaxis patients is displayed in Table 5. In
the study, 43 (53%) of the 81 patients on prophylaxis were
assigned to a two times weekly regimen (0 to < 6 years,
n = 16; ≥ 6 to < 12 years, n = 27) and 25 (31%) to a three
times weekly regimen (0 to < 6 years, n = 10; ≥ 6 to
< 12 years, n = 15) (Fig. 1).
One patient (assigned to a three times weekly regimen)
was excluded from the efficacy population because of a
pre-existing low titer inhibitor that was not correctly
reported at screening. Of the remaining 24 subjects in the
three times weekly regimen, one was assigned a dose
< 20 IU kg�1 (19 IU kg�1) and no subject was assigned a
dose > 50 IU kg�1. Of the 43 subjects in the two times
weekly regimen, no one was assigned a dose < 20 IU kg�1
and 40 subjects were assigned a dose between 20 and
50 IU kg�1.

rVIII-SingleChain efficacy, safety and PK 639
 The median initially assigned rVIII-SingleChain dose
was 32 IU kg�1 on the three times weekly prophylaxis
regimen and 35 IU kg�1 on the two times weekly regi-
men.
The
median
assigned
dose
at
study
end
was
32 IU kg�1
on
the
three
times
weekly
prophylaxis
regimen and 35.5 IU kg�1 on the two times weekly regi-
men. The percentage of prophylaxis subjects receiving at
least one dose adjustment was similar between the two
times weekly regimen (39.5%) and the three times weekly
regimen (41.7%). The median annual consumption of
rVIII-SingleChain on individualized prophylaxis across all
prophylaxis regimens was 4109 IU kg�1 (mean � SD;
4312 IU kg�1 � 1491).
A
small
number
of
patients
shifted from the two times weekly (n = 6), every other
day (n = 1) or once weekly (n = 1) regimens to a three
times weekly regimen.
Across all prophylaxis regimens (n = 80), the observed
median ABR was 3.69 (Q1, Q3: 0.00, 7.20) and the
observed median AsBR was 0.00 (Q1, Q3: 0.00, 2.20).
For joint bleeds, the observed median ABR was 1.62 (Q1,
Q3: 0.0, 4.87). All ABRs (total, AsBR and joint bleed
ABR) by regimen are listed in Table 6; ABRs by age
group are displayed in Table 7 (total, AsBR and joint
bleed ABR).
Investigators were allowed to adjust doses based on
clinical
bleeding
phenotypes.

 prophylaxis did not receive a dose adjustment during the
study; these patients had an ABR of 2.73. Within this
population, five children had ≥ 2 spontaneous bleeds
within a 14-day period but the dose was not adjusted;
these children had a median observed ABR of 6.94. In
comparison, the 44 prophylaxis patients with no dose
adjustment who did not have ≥ 2 spontaneous bleeds
within a 14-day period had an ABR of 2.58. Patients with
at least one dose adjustment had an ABR of 2.48 after
dose adjustment compared with an ABR of 7.83 prior to
dose adjustment.
Safety of rVIII-SingleChain
Immunogenicity
Immunogenicity was assessed in all 84
patients exposed to rVIII-SingleChain. No patients devel-
oped an inhibitor during exposure to rVIII-SingleChain,
including the 65 participants with ≥ 50 EDs, resulting in
an inhibitor cumulative incidence of 0% (95% CI, 0.0–
5.6%). One patient entered the study with a pre-existing
low titer inhibitor (3.46 BU mL�1) that was not correctly
reported at screening. Under an intensified prophylaxis
regimen with rVIII-SingleChain (50 IU kg�1 three times
weekly)
the
patient
became
inhibitor
negative
after
approximately 3 months and remained negative at the
end of the study.
Ten participants entered the study with a positive test
for non-inhibitory ADAs (i.e. anti-FVIII IgG and/or IgM
antibodies) prior to dosing with rVIII-SingleChain. Ten
other participants became positive for non-inhibitory
ADAs during the study. In the 19 prophylaxis patients in
the efficacy population (excluding the subject with the
pre-existing inhibitor) who had a positive test for non-
inhibitory ADAs at any time during the study, the med-
ian observed ABR (2.73) and the percentage of subjects
with no bleeding episodes (31.6%) were similar to the val-
ues in the 80 subjects on prophylaxis overall. Four of the
10 subjects who tested positive for ADAs at screening
participated in the initial PK investigation. The subjects
with ADAs demonstrated similar PK parameters to the
overall population in this study.
No patient had pre-existing anti-CHO antibodies or
developed these during the study.

rVIII-SingleChain was well tolerated.
In the investigator assessment of local tolerability, 99.4%
(307 of 309) of rVIII-SingleChain injections were assessed
as ‘none’ (i.e. without erythema) and two patients had a
total of two events of erythema categorized as ‘well
defined’. With regards to itching, pain and heat severity,
no reactions were reported except reactions assessed as
‘very slight’ in three patients. In the patient assessment of
local tolerability, 99.4% (4747 of 4774) of injections were
assessed as having no reaction. Of the 27 (0.56%) reac-
tions that were reported, none were severe. No relevant
differences were observed between age groups in either
the investigator’s or the subject’s assessment of local tol-
erability.
Adverse events
rVIII-SingleChain had an AE/serious
AE (SAE) profile in line with the expected background

rVIII-SingleChain efficacy, safety and PK 641
 pathology for pediatric patients with severe hemophilia
A, and as described for other products of the same class.
In this study, 64 patients experienced a total of 183 treat-
ment-emergent AEs, the majority (n = 137) being mild, 42
moderate and four severe in intensity. The most common
AEs were nasopharyngitis, cough, headache and arthral-
gia. Only one AE (hypersensitivity) was considered by the
investigator to be related to rVIII-SingleChain. The event
was mild in intensity, non-serious and did not require a
change in study medication. One AE resulted in with-
drawal from the study (unrelated event of hip arthralgia,
mild in intensity). Nine study participants experienced a
total of 11 treatment-emergent SAEs: four patients in the
0 to < 6 years age group and five patients in the ≥ 6 to
< 12 years age group (SAEs: hand fracture, laceration,
traumatic rupture of the spleen, device occlusion, systemic
inflammatory response syndrome, bacteremia, pneumonia,
anemia and dyspepsia). No SAEs were considered by the
investigator to be related to administration of rVIII-Sin-
gleChain. No thromboembolic events were observed.
Discussion
In this phase III pivotal study, a novel rFVIII in a single
polypeptide chain configuration was evaluated in a large
number of pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A.
PK, efficacy and safety of rVIII-SingleChain for the treat-
ment of bleeds and for routine prophylaxis were investi-
gated. Hemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent or good
in the vast majority (96.3%) of all bleeding episodes
assessed by the investigator. In the children on prophy-
laxis, the median AsBR was 0.00 and the median ABR was
3.69, with more than 80% of children receiving rVIII-Sin-
gleChain either two or three times weekly at doses between
20 and 50 IU kg�1. There were no cases of inhibitor devel-
opment during the study and the nature and frequency of
AEs were as expected for the study population.
Although rVIII-SingleChain demonstrated an improve-
ment in PK parameters compared with a full-length non-
modified rFVIII in adults and adolescents [4], the PK
investigation in this pediatric study did not include a com-
parator to minimize blood draws. Comparing PK results
across different studies, however, is problematic because
most PK parameters are highly dependent on the method
of analysis. In line with the observation that the clearance
of FVIII generally decreases and t1/2 increases from
infancy to adulthood [10–13], the PK investigation of
rVIII-SingleChain revealed that clearance was higher and
t1/2 was shorter in the pediatric population compared with
adolescents and adults [4]. Based on these observed PK
differences, almost all clinical trials mandate higher start-
ing doses [14–16]. Recognizing that clearance varies signif-
icantly between individuals within the same age range [17],
this study did not mandate specific pediatric dosing
recommendations, but instead allowed for higher dosing
and
frequency
depending
on
investigator
discretion.
Recommended doses and schedules mirrored those of the
rVIII-SingleChain adult and adolescent study [5].
The rVIII-SingleChain doses used to control bleeding
episodes (median dose of 27.6 IU kg�1) were within
expectations for a rFVIII product [8]. Eighty-six per cent
of all bleeds were effectively treated with just one infu-
sion, and 96% with one or two infusions. rVIII-Single-
Chain in children showed similar or better efficacy in
treating
bleeds
when
compared
with
other
recently
approved rFVIII concentrates. Klukowska et al. reported
efficacy ratings for on-demand treatment of breakthrough
bleeding episodes with simoctocog alfa (Nuwiq�) as excel-
lent or good for 82.4% of all bleeding episodes [18]. In a
study in 71 children < 12 years of age treated with
efmoroctocog alfa (Eloctate�), the reported treatment
success was 89.4% of bleeding events, of which 93% were
resolved with one or two injections [19]. Published data
in children < 6 years of age treated with octocog alfa
(Advate�) and children 0 to 11 years of age treated with
turoctocog alfa (Novoeight�) reported treatment success
rates of 93.8% and 92.1%, respectively [12,20].
As observed in the adult and adolescent study [5], the
majority of subjects were assigned to a two times weekly
(54%) or three times weekly regimen (30%) although a
higher percentage of pediatric subjects as compared with
the adult/adolescent study were assigned to a two times
weekly regimen, possibly reflecting the desire for parents
and children to minimize the number of injections per
week. Children assigned to a two times weekly prophy-
laxis regimen were not prescribed higher doses per injec-
tion (median dose, 35 IU kg�1) than subjects on a three
times weekly regimen (median dose, 32 IU kg�1) and
rVIII-SingleChain consumption in pediatrics was nearly
identical to that documented in the adults and adolescent
study [5]. The median ABR and AsBR in patients treated
three or two times weekly was low (2.30 and 0.00 / 4.37
and 0.00, respectively). Octocog alfa (Advate�) resulted in
an ABR of 4.0 in subjects aged 0 to < 6 years and 5.3 in
subjects aged > 7 to < 12 years on a three to four times
weekly regimen [12,21], and turoctocog alfa (Novoeight�)
resulted in an ABR of 3.02 in subjects on a three times
weekly or every second day regimen [20]. Overall con-
sumption was higher in both studies when compared with
the consumption observed in this study; the Advate�
study
reported
a
median
weekly
consumption
of
104 IU kg�1 vs. 79 IU kg�1 for rVIII-SingleChain and
the Novoeight� study reported a mean monthly consump-
tion of 462 IU kg�1 vs. 359 IU kg�1 for rVIII-Single-
Chain. Because the ABR for children on a three times
weekly regimen with rVIII-SingleChain was lower than,
and for children on a two times weekly regimen was simi-
lar to, those reported for Advate� and Novoeight�, chil-
dren treated with rVIII-SingleChain could achieve either
comparable ABRs with fewer injections or a reduction in
ABRs
by
nearly
half
with
an
unchanged
infusion
frequency.

642 O. Stasyshyn et al
 Today, children with severe hemophilia are encouraged
to exercise and take part in physical activities because
good muscle strength supports joints and may reduce the
frequency of bleeds, and studies have shown that partici-
pation in sports will have a direct impact on their overall
health-related quality of life [22]. Prevention of bleeds in
these active boys is challenging and requires meticulous
attention from the prescribing physician and highly indi-
vidualized therapeutic approaches. Although children in
both the 0 to < 6 years and 6 to < 12 years age groups
achieved AsBRs of 0.00, an increased ABR of 5.11 was
observed in children aged 6 to < 12 years when compared
with the ABR of 2.12 observed in children aged 0 to
< 6 years. The increase in ABR was driven primarily by
traumatic bleeds and thus is most likely to occur in a
more active population. Therefore, in line with other
recently approved products [19], more aggressive individu-
alized doses and regimens should be considered for very
active children who are more likely to experience trau-
matic bleeds. As such, this study demonstrates that indi-
vidualized dosing can result in very low ABRs when
investigators choose doses based on clinical bleeding phe-
notypes. The median ABR for subjects who did not have
their dose or dosing schedule adjusted was low (2.58),
although a subset of those subjects who had more than
two spontaneous bleeding episodes in any 2-week interval
but no dose adjustment had a significantly higher ABR
(6.94). Similarly, the median ABR for subjects who had a
dose adjustment was significantly higher (ABR = 7.83)
prior to the dose adjustment when compared with the
time post-adjustment (ABR = 2.48), highlighting the need
for active monitoring of prophylaxis success in children
with severe hemophilia A.
A low number of SAEs were documented in this study,
none of which was considered related to rVIII-Single-
Chain. No clinically relevant findings or safety concerns
were observed in the vital signs and clinical laboratory
data, and 99% of all injections were administered without
any documented local reactions. The use of rVIII-Single-
Chain for treatment of children with hemophilia A is also
supported by the observation that there were no anaphy-
lactic reactions, there was no inhibitor development under
exposure to rVIII-SingleChain and no antibodies against
CHO host cell proteins. As in studies of other recently
approved rFVIII products, some children developed non-
inhibitory ADAs (n = 10) during the study and 10 others
entered the study with pre-existing non-inhibitory ADAs.
It is important to mention that the ABR in patients with
non-inhibitory ADAs was not higher than the overall
ABR (2.73 vs. 3.69).
Overall, rVIII-SingleChain was highly effective in treat-
ing bleeding episodes in both age groups, and prophylactic
treatment with rVIII-SingleChain resulted in a low ABR.
rVIII-SingleChain offers many previously treated children
the benefit of twice weekly prophylaxis with excellent
tolerability and without the need to use a glyco-pegylated
or Fc fused product. Ongoing studies in previously
untreated children will show if the increased binding to
VWF will translate into a lower immunogenicity of rVIII-
SingleChain compared with other rFVIII products. The
differences in PK between adults and children should not
necessarily mandate the use of higher doses on a popula-
tion level. However, individualized doses and regimens
should be considered for very active children who are more
predisposed to traumatic bleeds. No inhibitor development
was documented in the study and rVIII-SingleChain
demonstrated a favorable safety profile.
