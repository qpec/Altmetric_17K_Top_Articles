IMPORTANCE Evidence from preclinical models indicates that xenon gas can prevent the
development of cerebral damage after acute global hypoxic-ischemic brain injury but, thus
far, these putative neuroprotective properties have not been reported in human studies.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of inhaled xenon on ischemic white matter damage
assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized single-blind phase 2 clinical drug trial
conducted between August 2009 and March 2015 at 2 multipurpose intensive care units in
Finland. One hundred ten comatose patients (aged 24-76 years) who had experienced
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomized.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive either inhaled xenon combined
with hypothermia (33°C) for 24 hours (n = 55 in the xenon group) or hypothermia treatment
alone (n = 55 in the control group).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was cerebral white matter damage
as evaluated by fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor MRI scheduled to be performed
between 36 and 52 hours after cardiac arrest. Secondary end points included neurological
outcome assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (score 0 [no symptoms] through 6
[death]) and mortality at 6 months.
RESULTS Among the 110 randomized patients (mean age, 61.5 years; 80 men [72.7%]), all
completed the study. There were MRI data from 97 patients (88.2%) a median of 53 hours
(interquartile range [IQR], 47-64 hours) after cardiac arrest. The mean global fractional
anisotropy values were 0.433 (SD, 0.028) in the xenon group and 0.419 (SD, 0.033) in the
control group. The age-, sex-, and site-adjusted mean global fractional anisotropy value was
3.8% higher (95% CI, 1.1%-6.4%) in the xenon group (adjusted mean difference, 0.016 [95%
CI, 0.005-0.027], P = .006). At 6 months, 75 patients (68.2%) were alive. Secondary end
points at 6 months did not reveal statistically significant differences between the groups. In
ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale, the median (IQR) value was 1 (1-6) in the xenon
group and 1 (0-6) in the control group (median difference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0]; P = .68). The
6-month mortality rate was 27.3% (15/55) in the xenon group and 34.5% (19/55) in the
control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.23-1.01]; P = .053).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,
inhaled xenon combined with hypothermia compared with hypothermia alone resulted in
less white matter damage as measured by fractional anisotropy of diffusion tensor MRI.
However, there was no statistically significant difference in neurological outcomes or
mortality at 6 months. These preliminary findings require further evaluation in an adequately
powered clinical trial designed to assess clinical outcomes associated with inhaled xenon
among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

S
urvivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have a poor
prognosis with high rates of death and the likelihood of
having severe neurological problems.1-5 International
guidelines recommend the provision of therapeutic hypother-
mia for comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;
theseguidelinesarebasedon2studies2,3inwhichpatientswith
an initial shockable rhythm who had been cooled to 33°C
achieved a better clinical outcome. However, a recent study4
suggestedthatpreventinghyperthermiathroughtargetedtem-
perature management to 36°C could be as neuroprotective as
33°C regardless of the initial rhythm at the time of the out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest. The optimal temperature for targeted
temperature management has yet to be defined and the effi-
cacy of the treatment is modest at best.2,3
In animal studies, the neuroprotective properties of the in-
haled noble gas xenon have been established; these effects are
mediated through multiple putative molecular targets in the
pathways involved in postresuscitation brain injury.6-12 Neu-
roprotection associated with xenon has been especially evi-
dentwhencombinedwithhypothermia(33°Cto35°C)andboth
additiveandsynergisticinteractionshavebeenreportedonthe
basis of histopathological and functional outcomes.9-12 A re-
cent study13 demonstrated that xenon inhalation is well tol-
erated and has favorable cardiovascular properties when ad-
ministered to patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia
after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
In this study, we investigated the effect of xenon on the
extent of cerebral white matter brain damage as assessed by
diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in coma-
tose survivors from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who have
hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.
Methods
Study Design
Weconductedarandomized2-groupsingle-blindphase2clini-
cal drug trial at 2 multipurpose intensive care units in Finland.
The study was approved by the ethics committee of the
Hospital District of Southwest Finland and the institutional
review boards of the Helsinki University Hospital and the
Finnish Medicines Agency. An independent data and safety
monitoring committee reviewed data after enrollment of ev-
ery 4 patients and after each 6-month interval.
Thestudywasconductedaccordingtogoodclinicalpractice
andthecurrentrevisionoftheDeclarationofHelsinki14guiding
clinical drug research in human subjects. Written informed as-
sent was obtained from the next of kin or from the legal repre-
sentativeofthepatientwithin4hoursafterhospitalarrival.The
patient’
sfamilywasinformedabouttherighttowithdrawfrom
the study at any point but that the data collected until possible
withdrawalcouldbeusedintheanalysesaspredefinedinthetrial
protocol (Supplement 1). Patients were informed accordingly if
they regained consciousness. The mode of death was classified
asneurological,cardiological,ormultiorganasdescribedearlier.1
The patients were allocated in 1:1 ratio with random block
sizes of 4, 6, and 8 to receive either therapeutic hypothermia
treatment alone for 24 hours (defined as the control group) or
inhaled xenon (LENOXe, Air Liquide Medical GmbH) in com-
bination with hypothermia for 24 hours (defined as the xenon
group). The treatment assignments were randomly generated
by a computer. Sequentially numbered sealed envelopes were
used separately in the 2 centers for randomization, which was
performed after the assent was granted. Clinical investigators
performed the patient enrollment, randomization, and inter-
ventionassignment.Personnelinvolvedinthetreatmentofthe
patient could not be blinded due to practical and safety consid-
erations; however, the MRI analysis of white matter injury was
operator-independent, and the neurological end point evalu-
ators as well as the patients were blinded to the treatment.
The diffusion tensor MRI results were not made available
to the clinicians treating the patients to avoid bias. For pa-
tients in whom there was premature termination of the hypo-
thermia treatment, xenon administration also was discontin-
ued. A local neurological prognostication consensus was used
in decisions to withdraw life-sustaining treatment (eMethods
in Supplement 2).
Patients
Comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest consecu-
tively admitted to the Turku and Helsinki University hospi-
tals were screened for eligibility. The main criteria for inclu-
sion were witnessed cardiac arrest from an initial rhythm
amenable to defibrillation (ie, ventricular fibrillation or non-
perfusing ventricular tachycardia and return of spontaneous
circulation within ≤45 minutes). Details of inclusion and
exclusion criteria appear in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
Treatment Protocol
The patients underwent coronary angiographic interventions
whenclinicallyindicated.Integratedcareaftercardiacarrestand
patient monitoring adhered to recent recommendations.2,15
Therewasadherencetothedetailedtreatmentprotocolregard-
ing cooling treatment and xenon intervention (eMethods in
Supplement 2). Inhaled xenon was initiated immediately after
randomizationthroughaclosed-systemventilator(PhysioFlex,
Dräger). Oxygen and air were delivered to achieve an end-tidal
xenon concentration of at least 40% (measured continuously
by the thermoconductive monitor on the ventilator).
Outcome
The primary end point was the severity of ischemic white mat-
ter brain injury as evaluated by fractional anisotropy from dif-
fusion tensor MRI. Although the study was not powered to de-
tect statistical differences in clinical efficacy, the following
variables were collected as exploratory secondary end points:
neurological outcome using the Cerebral Performance Cat-
egory (CPC) score (from 1 [conscious, alert, able to work, might
have mild cognitive deficit] to 5 [death]) and the modified
Rankin Scale (mRS) score (from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]),
mortality at 6 months, and the complication (eg, severe bleed-
ing, pneumonia, sepsis, acute kidney injury,16 pulmonary
edema, ventricular arrhythmias, and epileptic status17) rate
within 7 days after cardiac arrest.

ploratory neurocognitive outcome. The minimally clinically
important differences for CPC and NIHSS have not been es-
tablished; changes in MMSE of 4 or more points have been in-
terpreted as clinically significant.18 Differences in mRS score
as low as 0.46 have been considered clinically meaningful by
practice guidelines.19,20

MRI Protocol and Image Processing
Patients were scheduled to undergo brain MRI within 16 hours
after rewarming; ranging from 36 to 52 hours after out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest. Magnetic resonance imaging was per-
formed with a Verio 3T scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions)
atbothcenters,withidenticalimagingprotocols.Diffusionten-
sor MRI data was preprocessed using DTIprep quality control
software (eMethods in Supplement 2). Version 5.0 of the FSL
software package (FMRIB) was used for the tract-based spa-
tial statistical analysis.25-29 This observer-independent and
hypothesis-freemethodhastheabilitytospatiallylocategroup
differences in the diffusion tensor MRI data.
Fractional anisotropy and diffusivity maps were calcu-
lated for each patient and these images were projected on a
mean skeleton with a voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm (ie, 119 013 vox-
els per patient), which represents the centers of all major white
matter structures. These skeletonized images were then used
for voxel-wise statistics to identify all tracts with voxels re-
vealing statistically significant differences in diffusion para-
meters. Localization and labeling of the major white matter
tracts were confirmed according to the Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity white matter tractography atlas.30 Additional details of the
MRIprotocol,qualitycontrolofimaging,imageprocessing,and
tract-based spatial statistics appear in the eMethods, eTable
2, and eTable3 in Supplement 2.
Statistical Analyses
The sample size was based on a power analysis of fractional
anisotropy values. However, a clinically relevant difference in
the effect size had not been established. Therefore, this dif-
ference was arbitrarily set at 15%, which proved to be unreal-
istically large given that the difference in the mean fractional
anisotropy values between those patients who survived and
those who died was only 6.4% (eTable 7 in Supplement 2). The
number of patients was predetermined based on the result ob-
tained from the power analysis. Accordingly, it was esti-
mated that 55 patients per group would be needed to reveal
an absolute median difference of 15% in fractional anisotropy
between the groups (85% power and a 2-sided α level of .05).
The Shapiro-Wilk W test was used to test for normality of
all continuous variables. The 2-sample t test and the Mann-
Whitney test were used to compare continuous variables be-
tweenthegroups.Categoricalvariableswereanalyzedwiththe
χ2 test or the Fisher exact test. The Mann-Whitney test and the
Hodges-Lehmann estimate were used for the ordinal vari-
ables of mRS and CPC to calculate median differences be-
tween the groups. Between-group differences in global frac-
tionalanisotropyanddiffusivityvalues(radial,axial,andmean)
were analyzed using the 2-sample t test and analysis of cova-
riancewithadjustmentforage,sex,andsiteasrecommended.31
Permutation-based voxel-wise statistical analysis of frac-
tional anisotropy values was performed with tract-based spa-
tial statistics in conjunction with family-wise error correc-
tion for multiple comparisons across space.29
The follow-up time for survival analysis was calculated
from the time of cardiac arrest until death or 6 months. A com-
plete case analysis was applied to the primary end point due
to missing MRI data for 6 patients in the control group and 7
patients in the xenon group. Multiple imputation was not per-
formed due to lack of a good prognostic model to predict valid
imputed values for missing data. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
and a Cox proportional hazards model were used to compare
mortality at 6 months between the groups in the intention-
to-treat population. The proportional hazards assumptions
were evaluated with the log-cumulative hazard plot and
martingale-based residuals; the assumptions were met. The
observation was censored in the survival analysis if the pa-
tient was withdrawn from the study or was still alive at the end
of the 6-month follow-up. Analyses were adjusted with the fol-
lowing prognostic factors: age, sex, time to return of sponta-
neouscirculation,coolingrate,andsite.32Inaddition,theglobal
fractional anisotropy and diffusivity values were used as fac-
tors associated with 6-month mortality after adjustment for
age, sex, group, and site.
A 2-sided P value of less than .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. Secondary end points were not adjusted for
multiplicity and were therefore described as exploratory.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc).

September 2014; and the 6-month follow-up was completed
during March 2015. A total of 224 patients were screened for
eligibility and of these, 110 (aged 24 to 76 years) were en-
rolled with 55 randomly assigned to the xenon group and 55
to the control group (Figure 1). The patient characteristics of
the 2 randomized groups were similar (Table 1). One patient
in the xenon group was withdrawn from the study 6 days af-
ter the index event by the next of kin.
Treatment
Themeanend-tidalxenonconcentrationwas48.2%(SD,3.8%)
and the range was 41.4% to 56.9%. Neither core temperatures
on admission to the intensive care unit nor during treatment
and intervention differed between the groups; time from car-
diac arrest to hypothermia target was also similar (Table 1 and
eTable 4 in Supplement 2). There were no differences in the
routinely measured laboratory parameters (eTable 4). Deci-
sions to withdraw life-sustaining treatment were based on a
consensus agreement that there was a poor neurological
outcome (eTable 5). Of the 34 patients who died, 29 (85.3%)
had a neurological mode of death (eTable 6).
Primary End Point
Diffusion tensor MRI data for the tract-based spatial statistics
analysis were obtained from 48 patients in the xenon group
and 49 patients in the control group a median of 53 hours
(interquartile range [IQR], 47-64 hours) after cardiac arrest. At
6 months, 75 patients (68.2%) were alive and able to provide
data for follow-up. The reasons for missing MRI data appear
in Figure 1. Using tract-based spatial statistics analysis, a

statistical parametric map containing 119 013 voxels was cre-
ated to visualize the spatial distribution of areas with signifi-
cantly lower fractional anisotropy in the control group
(Figure 2). The fractional anisotropy was significantly lower
in 41.7% of the voxels in the control group than in the xenon
group (ie, 58.3% of the voxels did not differ between the
groups). The tract-wise distribution of the percentages ap-
pears in Figure 2. None of the voxels revealed significantly
lower fractional anisotropy values in the xenon group.
The mean global fractional anisotropy values of all voxels
presentedinFigure2were0.433(SD,0.028)inthexenongroup
and 0.419 (SD, 0.033) in the control group (P = .03; Table 2).
The age-, sex-, and site-adjusted mean global fractional anisot-
ropy value was 3.8% higher (95% CI, 1.1% to 6.4%) in the
xenon group (adjusted mean difference, 0.016 [95% CI, 0.005
to 0.027], P = .006). The mean radial diffusivity value was
0.598 (SD, 0.051) for the xenon group and 0.619 (SD, 0.062)
for the control group. The adjusted radial diffusivity value was
3.9% lower (95% CI, 0.5%-7.4%) in the xenon group than in the
control group (adjusted mean difference, −0.024 [95% CI,
−0.046 to −0.003], P = .03; Table 2). Collectively, these quan-
titativedifferencesindiffusiontensorMRIvaluesindicatedthat
there had been more severe disruption of white matter in the
control group.
Of the diffusion tensor MRI measures, global fractional
anisotropy exhibited the best independent predictive value for
mortality during the 6-month follow-up period (mean [SD] of
0.433[0.026]inthesurvivingpatientsvs0.407[0.035]inthose
who died per 0.01-unit increase in fractional anisotropy); the
age-, sex-, group-, and site-adjusted hazard ratio was 0.81 (95%
CI, 0.69-0.94; P = .006) (eTable 7 in Supplement 2). The mean
global fractional anisotropy was 6.4% higher (95% CI, 3.3%-
9.5%) in the surviving patients than in those who died.
Secondary End Points
In the intention-to-treat population, the Kaplan-Meier sur-
vival estimate after 6-month follow-up was 27.3% (15/55) in the
xenon group and 34.5% (19/55) in the control group (adjusted
hazard ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.23-1.01], P = .053; eFigure 1 in
Supplement 2).
At 6 months, neurological outcome was not significantly
different between the groups as assessed with the CPC
(median score of 1 [IQR, 1-5] for the xenon group and 1 [IQR,
1-5] for the control group; median difference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0],
P = .93) or the mRS (median score of 1 [IQR, 0-6] for the xe-
non group and 1 [IQR, 0-6] for the control group; median dif-
ference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0], P = .68).
Similarly, the rates of serious adverse events were not sig-
nificantly different between the groups at 6 months (Table 3
and eTable 8 in Supplement 2). In addition, there was not any
difference in neurocognitive outcome measures of MMSE
(median of 29 [IQR, 27-30] for the xenon group and median
of 29 [IQR, 28-30] for the control group) and NIHSS (median
of 0 [IQR, 0-0] for the xenon and control groups).

White matter damage leads to a loss of microstructural organization that can be
quantified by the loss of directionality in the diffusion of water molecules in the
white matter tracts. Fractional anisotropy is a scalar value representing this
directionality of water diffusion; lower fractional anisotropy values are
indicative of less organized diffusion and are an index of more extensive white
matter damage. The visualization presents the results of the voxel-wise
tract-based spatial statistics analysis of fractional anisotropy values between
the xenon group and the control group. Voxels with significantly (P < .05,
family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons) lower fractional
anisotropy values in the control group were identified and are shown in red in
the statistical visualization (ie, 41.7% of all 119 013 analyzed voxels), whereas the
areas in which there was no significant difference in fractional anisotropy values
between the groups are shown in green (ie, 58.3% of all analyzed voxels).
According to the Johns Hopkins University white matter tractography atlas, the
tract-wise distribution of the voxels (percentages in parentheses below) with
significantly (P < .05; family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons)
lower fractional anisotropy in the control group (marked red in the figure) were
as follows: cingulum (cingulate gyrus) (54.6%), cingulum (hippocampal region)
(1.4%), forceps minor (49.4%) and major (35.5%), superior longitudinal
fasciculus (49.3%), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (34.8%), anterior thalamic
radiation (45.1%), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (41.0%), corticospinal tract
(28.7%), uncinate fasciculus (36.4%), and the body of corpus callosum (72.3%).

neurological outcome.33 We analyzed the discriminating value
of the global fractional anisotropy for survival to estimate
whetheraclinicalbenefitcouldaccruefromthehigherfractional
anisotropy values in the xenon group. We found that the mean
globalfractionalanisotropyvaluewassignificantlyhigheramong
survivorsandinthexenongroupcomparedwiththosewhodied
and those in the control group. In addition, of all the diffusion
tensorMRImeasures,lowerfractionalanisotropywasassociated
with mortality during the 6-month follow-up.
With regard to the other diffusion tensor MRI para-
meters, each of the diffusivity values was lower in the xenon
group; however, the reductions only achieved statistical sig-
nificance for radial diffusivity (Table 2). In an earlier study in
which patients with severe brain injury were scanned at times
varying from 5 days to 7 weeks after cardiac arrest, the radial
diffusivity values were significantly higher than the corre-
sponding values from healthy volunteers.34 The mean diffu-
sivity data from 14 patients treated with hypothermia and who
received an MRI scan within 3 days of their cardiac arrest did
not predict outcome.35 In this study, higher unadjusted ra-
dial and mean diffusivity values were independent predic-
torsofmortalityduringthe6-monthfollow-up.However,none
oftheadjusteddiffusivityvaluescouldclearlydiscriminatebe-
tween survivors and nonsurvivors and hence the clinical value
of these metrics remains unproven.
Althoughthestatisticallysignificantdifference(P = .006)be-
tween patients treated with xenon and those untreated for ad-
justed mean global fractional anisotropy values was only 3.8%
(adjusted mean difference of 0.016), this magnitude of change
needs to be considered in the context of the statistically signifi-
cant difference between survivors and those who died of
6.4% (eTable 7 in Supplement 2). In addition, a diluting effect
of voxels, without significant difference between the groups
(displayed in green in Figure 2) in the final tract-based spatial
statistical analysis, resulted in reduced absolute mean differ-
ence in the global fractional anisotropy values (Table 2).
Thus, the treatment effect size of xenon on global fractional
anisotropy was more than 50% of the difference in this pri-
mary outcome measure observed between survivors and those
whodied.Furthermore,theseverityofobservedwidespreadin-
jury was demonstrated by the finding that 41.7% of the white
matter tracts on average, including major commissural, asso-
ciative, and projection fibers, were significantly more severely
injured in the control group than in the xenon group. These fi-
bersareinvolvedinmultipleimportantcognitivefunctions,such
asattention,memory,language,emotions,auditory,visualand
executive processing, and motor functions of the body.
The volume of white matter constitutes 50% of total brain
volume in humans and is highly vulnerable to even brief
ischemia.36 The present results indicate that the higher radial
diffusivity (demyelination) was mainly responsible for the
lower fractional anisotropy in patients in the control group.24
An earlier study revealed that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors
are expressed in myelin of white matter oligodendrocytes and
become activated during ischemia37; xenon is a N-methyl-D-
aspartatereceptorantagonistandacompetitiveinhibitoratthe
glycine coactivation site of that receptor.7,8 Although not dem-
onstrated here, it is possible that sensitive tests of neurocogni-
tivefunctioninanappropriatelypoweredclinicaltrialmaytrans-
latetheimprovementinwhitematterintoclinicalbenefits.This
hypothesis warrants further investigation.
Although a benefit of xenon on white matter damage was
observed, there were no significant differences in the explor-
atoryanalysisineitherneurological(CPCormRSscore;Table3)
or cognitive outcomes (NHISS or MMSE score) between the 2
treatmentgroups.Thestudywasunderpoweredtodetectasta-
tistically significant difference in clinical outcome due to the
rarity of severe neurological impairment in long-term survi-
vors after cardiac arrest; about 90% of patients who experi-
ence cardiac arrest and are alive at the 6-month follow-up have

experienced a good neurological outcome (CPC score of 1
or 2).38-41 In both groups, the MMSE score was 29 of a maxi-
mum score of 30; this was very similar to the score of 28 that
was reported in a large targeted temperature management
study comparing comatose cardiac arrest survivors treated at
33°C and 36°C, and may reflect the small effect size that this
test is capable of eliciting.40 Therefore, in subsequent stud-
ies, more sensitive methods will be needed for assessing func-
tional neurocognitive disorders.
The study had several limitations. First, the secondary end
points were not adjusted for multiplicity and therefore were
described as exploratory. Second, in the analysis of secondary
end points, we did not have sensitive enough neurocognitive
tests to measure subtle degrees of functional disability in the
small number of patients that could be assessed. Third, our pri-
mary end point was based on a single time point in the early
stage of evolving brain injury; it remains to be determined
whether the improvement in the diffusion tensor MRI metrics
persists and can contribute to a long-term clinical benefit.
Fourth, all patients received delayed xenon intervention and
therefore it is possible that the observed effect on white mat-
ter may have been different if the xenon intervention had been
initiated earlier after the ischemic event. Fifth, although more
than 80% of the deaths in this study were due to severe ische-
micbraininjury,underlyingcardiacdiseasealsomayhavecon-
tributed to poor outcomes, therefore, it is unknown whether
some patients might have benefitted from the improved car-
diovascularstabilityassociatedwithxenon.13Sixth,thesample
size calculation of the present study was based on an unreal-
istic assumption of the absolute difference of fractional anisot-
ropyvaluesbetweenthegroups.Nonetheless,becausethevari-
ance of the variable was proportionally smaller, there was a
statistically significant difference between the groups; how-
ever,theabsolutedifferenceinfractionalanisotropywassmall.
Seventh,thepredictivevalueofglobalfractionalanisotropyfor
survival needs to be prospectively validated before designat-
ing the improvement in white matter injury seen in the xenon
group as a marker for improved survival.
Conclusions
Among comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,
inhaledxenoncombinedwithhypothermiacomparedwithhy-
pothermia alone resulted in less white matter damage as mea-
sured by fractional anisotropy of diffusion tensor MRI. How-
ever, there was no statistically significant difference in
neurological outcomes or mortality at 6 months. These pre-
liminary findings require further evaluation in an adequately
powered clinical trial designed to assess clinical outcomes
associated with inhaled xenon among survivors of out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest.
