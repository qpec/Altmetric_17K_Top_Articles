There is mounting evidence that aerobic exercise has a positive effect on cognitive functions in older adults. To date, little is known
about the neurometabolic and molecular mechanisms underlying this positive effect. The present study used magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and quantitative MRI to systematically explore the effects of physical activity on human brain metabolism and grey
matter (GM) volume in healthy aging. This is a randomised controlled assessor-blinded two-armed trial (n = 53) to explore exercise-
induced neuroprotective and metabolic effects on the brain in cognitively healthy older adults. Participants (age 465) were
allocated to a 12-week individualised aerobic exercise programme intervention (n = 29) or a 12-week waiting control group (n = 24).
The main outcomes were the change in cerebral metabolism and its association to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels
as well as changes in GM volume. We found that cerebral choline concentrations remained stable after 12 weeks of aerobic exercise
in the intervention group, whereas they increased in the waiting control group. No effect of training was seen on cerebral N-acetyl-
aspartate concentrations, nor on markers of neuronal energy reserve or BDNF levels. Further, we observed no change in cortical GM
volume in response to aerobic exercise. The finding of stable choline concentrations in the intervention group over the 3 month
period might indicate a neuroprotective effect of aerobic exercise. Choline might constitute a valid marker for an effect of aerobic
exercise on cerebral metabolism in healthy aging.

INTRODUCTION
Physical activity seems beneficial in the prevention of cognitive
impairment
and
dementia
in
the
elderly.1–3
The
potential
mechanisms behind the protective effects of physical activity on
cognitive function are assumed to be multidimensional. It has
been suggested that aerobic exercise renders the brain more
efficient, plastic and adaptive, which leads to improved memory
and executive function.2,4 In brief, mechanisms comprise positive
functional changes in hemodynamic activity, synaptic plasticity,
neurogenesis and neural cell proliferation with newly formed
neurons being integrated functionally into neural networks.4–6
The influence of physical activity on neural plasticity is closely
linked or even dependent on various aspects of brain metabolism,
for example, exercise upregulates multiple proteins in the
hippocampus that have a defined role in energy metabolism,
comprising enzymes involved in glucose catabolism, adenosin-tri-
phosphate (ATP) synthesis and glutamate turnover.7 Magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive, convenient and
rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that is
sensitive to metabolic changes in the brain.8 Several biomolecules
that are relevant to cerebral energy metabolism, neural plasticity
and brain aging can be detected and quantified using proton MRS
(1H MRS) and/or phosphorus MRS (31P MRS), including myo-
inositol,
glutamate,
total
choline
(tCho),
creatine
(Cr),
phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP and N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Myo-
inositol and glutamate are both astrocyte markers.9 Total choline
(the sum of phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine) has
been proposed as a marker of pathological membrane turnover
and inflammation.10 Neurodegeneration is commonly associated
with decreased glutamate levels, while myo-inositol and total
choline levels are typically elevated.10 Creatine is commonly used
as an internal standard to scale other metabolites, as it is generally
constant in the normal brain spectrum.11 Phosphocreatine has an
important role in adenosine-tri-phosphate synthesis and is there-
fore considered as the central energy marker for neurons and
astrocytes.11 NAA in particular has been proposed as a marker of
neuronal health, viability and number.12 Prior studies have shown
that levels of NAA and NAA/Cr ratios are lower in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) compared to healthy aging, and that decreased NAA/
Cr levels can predict future conversion from mild cognitive
impairment (MCI)
to AD.13,14
Further,
the
NAA/Cr
ratio
is
considered to be reflective of neuronal density, functional
integrity, loss of synapses and higher pTau burden.15
Preservation or increase of regional grey matter (GM) volume is
another non-invasive MRI marker that has been widely applied to
study healthy or pathological brain aging. Accordingly, regional
GM volume (for example, hippocampal volume) has been used as
an outcome measure in studies on the favourable effects of

 exercise on the brain structure in older people.4,16 We know of
only two previous studies that have investigated the effects of a
controlled aerobic exercise intervention on brain metabolism and
GM volume; one in healthy young men17 and one in schizophrenic
male patients.18 To the best of our knowledge, no randomised
controlled trial has been conducted so far to systematically
investigate the effects of an individualised aerobic exercise
programme on GM volume and brain metabolism in cognitively
healthy older adults.
The effects of exercise on brain metabolism and brain structure
may be associated with an increase of the neurotrophin brain-
derived
neurotrophic
factor
(BDNF).19
Exercise
differentially
regulates synaptic proteins associated with the function of
BDNF.15 Erickson et al.4 have shown an association between
BDNF levels and exercise-related changes in memory and
hippocampal volumes in older adults.4 However, other studies
failed to show an association between hippocampal volume and
an increase in BDNF following exercise.20
In sum, it can be hypothesised that an enhancement in
neuronal plasticity following aerobic exercise might be associated
with increased NAA levels and an increase of cortical GM volume,
accompanied by increased serum BDNF levels. Furthermore, we
assumed that aerobic exercise leads to an increase of markers of
neuronal energy reserve, in particular, the ratios of phosphocrea-
tine or adenosine-tri-phosphate to inorganic phosphate (Pi).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design of the study
This is a randomised controlled partially blinded two-armed trial,
evaluating the effects of a 12-week individualised aerobic exercise
programme on cerebral metabolism and GM volume in cognitively
healthy older adults, in comparison to a waiting control group. The study
had previously been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Goethe
University of Frankfurt am Main, Germany (reference 107/13) and is in
agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki (Version Fortaleza 2012). Trial
registration is NCT02343029 (clinicaltrials.gov). The study protocol has
been published previously.21
Setting
Participants (cognitive healthy, 465 years) were recruited in three assisted
living facilities in Frankfurt am Main, Germany and via local print media
informed by the university press agency.
Written informed consent was obtained from participants fulfilling the
inclusion criteria and willing to participate: for details please refer to
Fleckenstein et al.21 At baseline participants passed three incoming visits
to assess cognitive performance (visit 1a), movement-related parameters
and cardiopulmonary fitness (visit 1b). Furthermore, brain scans compris-
ing MRS and quantitative MRI (qMRI) (visit 1c) were conducted. Following
the baseline assessments, participants were randomised to the interven-
tion group or to the waiting control group (for details of the randomisation
procedure see ref. 21). Participants in the intervention group started the
individualised 12-week aerobic exercise intervention in the integrated gym
hall of one of the participating assisted living facilities 6 days after the MRI
scans. Participants in the waiting control group waited 12 weeks before
starting the exercise intervention. All participants were asked not to
change their habitual physical activity during the following 3 months,
except for the intervention. Twelve weeks after allocation, all participants
were scheduled for visits 2a–c adhering to fixed inter-assessment intervals.
Exercise intervention started at this point for participants in the waiting
control group. This is part of a secondary study protocol, which is beyond
the scope of the present manuscript.
Type of participants
Only cognitive healthy participants (465 years—no upper age limit)
fulfilling the inclusion criteria (see ref. 21) were included in the study.
Cognitive healthy was defined as presenting no signs of dementia or mild
cognitive impairment in cognitive performance during neuropsychological
assessment and no impairment in activities of daily living.
Intervention
The intervention group participated in a 12-week supervised cycle
ergometer training (optibike med, ergoline, Bitz, Germany) with three
sessions (each session 30 min) per week. Workload in watts (W) at first
ventilatory threshold (VT1) (equivalent to 64 ± 9% VO2max) was applied as
individual aerobic exercise intensity.22 After 4 weeks, all participants’
physical performance was reassessed, and exercise intensity was read-
justed, if necessary.
Outcome measures
Main outcome measures were the change in cerebral metabolism, as
assessed by MRS and changes in GM volume, as assessed with qMRI. The
metabolites investigated in this study included NAA, Cr, Cho, ATP,
glycerophosphocholine (GPC), phosphocholine (PCho) and PCr.
The MRI scans took place at the Brain Imaging Center, Frankfurt am
Main, Germany. Data were acquired using a 3 Tesla whole-body scanner
(Magnetom Trio, Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany) optimised for
examinations of the cranium. The MRI and MRS protocols have been
reported elsewhere.21 In contrast to conventional MRI techniques for the
acquisition of data sets with different weightings, the goal of qMRI is the
measurement of parameter maps, where the local intensity directly
represents the value of a certain tissue parameter. Thus, these maps are
not biased by any other parameters. Apart from the investigation of diffuse
pathologies, parameter maps allow for the construction of synthetic
anatomical data sets that are free from inhomogeneities of the radio
frequency (RF) coils used and provide improved contrasts. In the present
case, qMRI methods were employed to obtain maps of the longitudinal
relaxation time (T1) and the proton density (PD) for the construction of T1-
weighted, bias-free synthetic anatomies.
Venous blood samples for quantification of the neurotrophin BDNF were
drawn between 0900 hours and 1300 hours. When possible, time of
sampling was held consistent for each participant at baseline and follow-
up. Quantification of serum BDNF was performed in the Laboratory for
Clinical Pharmacology, Psychiatric University Hospital Charité in Berlin
using a modified fluorometric ELISA method, as described elsewhere.23
Secondary outcome measures included maximal and submaximal out-
come measures from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), resting
heart rate (HR rest) and measures of cognitive performance: verbal
declarative memory, frontal executive control, working memory, semantic
and phonematic fluency as well as nonverbal declarative memory (refer to
ref. 21 for the respective assessment instruments that were used).
To determine the ventilatory thresholds, we adhered to the V‐slope
method. We strictly followed the instructions as given by Karlman
Wassermann in regard of his 9-panels.
First ventilatory threshold (VT1) and respiratory compensation point
(RCP) were independently determined by two investigators and differ-
ences were reviewed by a third person. First, ventilatory threshold was
defined as (1) non-linear increase in VCO2 vs VO2, (2) first non-linear
increase of ventilation vs workload (VE/WL), (3) first increase of expiratory
partial pressure of oxygen vs workload (PETO2/WL), (4) first non-linear
increase of ventilatory equivalent of oxygen (VE/VO2) vs workload with no
concomitant increase of equivalent of carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2).24
Respiratory compensation point was identified by (1) second non-linear
increase in minute ventilation vs workload (VE/WL), (2) first non-linear
increase of VE vs VCO2 accompanied by a concomitant non-linear increase
in VE/VCO2 vs workload, (3) non-linear decrease of expiratory partial
pressure of carbon dioxide vs workload (PETCO2/WL).24
Further outcomes were physical performance parameters (for a detailed
description please refer to ref. 21), but the respective results are beyond
the scope of this manuscript.
Data analysis and power calculations
Power calculations had been estimated on data published by Pajonk
et al.18 A group size of 30 participants was deemed to be adequate. The
risks of data losses due to poor data quality or subject drop-out were
estimated to be about 25% in each case. Thus, the total sample size was 60.
For full power calculations please refer to the study protocol.21
Data analysis was performed by blinded evaluators. Statistical analysis
adhered to current standards in reporting clinical trials, differentiating for
parametric and non-parametric data, first using the Kolgomorov–Smirnov
test and applying the respective tests thereafter. Changes over time were
analysed by applying repeated-measures methods. Mulitvariate analyses of
variance with a repeated-measures design (MANOVAsRM) with group

 (target vs control intervention) as between-subject factor and time (pre,
post) as within subject factor were performed for MRS data analysis and
qMRI data analysis. Repeated measure ANOVAS with group as between-
subject factor and time as within subject factor were performed for BDNF
concentrations and cognitive performance scores. Furthermore, correla-
tional analyses were performed for changes in fitness levels and changes in
those variables that showed a significant time × group interaction to
analyse whether changes in the outcome measures could be attributed to
the effects of aerobic exercise. For all analyses, SPSS 22 (IBM SPSS Statistics
for Windows, Version 22, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used.
MRS data analysis
The 1H MRS spectra were fitted with the software tool LCModel, using the
downloadable test version at: http://s-provencher.com;25 which simulates
the spectra with a linear combination of model spectra and is considered
to be the most suitable tool for the analysis of short-TE spectra.26 Baseline
correction included macromolecules. The 31P MRS data were analysed with
the tool jMRUI,27 which was found to be more appropriate for these types
of spectra. Concentration changes of 1H MRS metabolites were quantified
as ratios to either total creatine (tCr: the sum of PCr and Cr) or total choline
(tCho: the sum of GPC and PC), whereas concentrations of 31P MRS
metabolites were quantified as ratios to either PCr or Pi. Metabolite signal
intensities depend on coil loading and local B1, thus, absolute quantifica-
tion of metabolite concentrations requires corrections, which take into
account the interindividual changes of these parameters. As those
parameters affect all metabolites evenly, their effect is cancelled when
using metabolite ratios.
Figure 1 depicts the target regions and representative spectra.
qMRI data analysis
From the quantitative maps of PD and T1, synthetic MPRAGE28 data sets
were
derived,
using
a
mathematical
formalism
described
in
the
literature,29,30 assuming the parameters: TR = 2420 ms, TI = 960 ms, excita-
tion angle 9°, echo spacing 10.2 ms and isotropic spatial resolution: 1 mm.
Changes in GM volume following the intervention were analysed with
voxel-based morphometry31 in SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive
Neurology, London, UK) running under Matlab 8 (Mathworks, Sherborn,
MA, USA). Data preprocessing and statistical analyses were performed by
applying a longitudinal data processing batch implemented in the vbm8
toolbox (http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm). For a detailed description of
the processing chain see ref. 17. Smoothing of GM segments was
performed using a 6 mm Gaussian Kernel. A two way ANOVA with group
(target vs control intervention) as first factor and time (pre, post) as second
factor was calculated for the smoothed GM segments. The whole-brain
analysis was followed by a region of Interest (ROI) analysis. For the ROI
analysis, a hippocampus ROI in MNI space was used that was provided by
the Wake Forest University (WFU) PickAtlas Toolbox (http://fmri.wfubmc.
edu/software/pickatlas). All analyses were thresholded with a family-wise
error (FWE)-corrected voxel significance level of Po0.05. In addition,
volumes of bilateral hippocampi (in cm3) were determined for each subject
and time point and then included in the repeated-measures MANOVAs in
SPSS 22.
RESULTS
Population characteristics
Of the 74 subjects screened, 62 subjects meeting the criteria of
eligibility were scheduled for visit 1 and 60 participants were
randomised into the study. At 3 month, seven participants had
dropped out (6 in the control group, reasons: health issues n = 3,
group allocation n = 1, non-compliance with schedule n = 1, non-
compliance with MRI scan n = 2). Of these 53 participants (25
female and 28 male, age 75.3 ± 7.2 years, 74.2 ± 13.5 kg, 168.3 ± 10
cm), 31 participants were recruited in three assisted living facilities
and 22 participants were recruited by local print media. Twenty-
nine of the participants were part of the intervention group,
receiving individualised training sessions of 40 min. On average,
they performed 34.6 ± 3.3 (range: 27–44) training sessions with a
total of 1384 ± 133.7 min. All 53 participants completed the
assessments at baseline and after 3 month, and were subject of
the statistical analyses (see Table 1 for demographic data of the
sample).
The study flow chart is depicted in Figure 2.
Physical performance
Repeated measures ANOVA (group × time) revealed significant
effects (Po0.05) of ergometer training on resting heart rate (HR
rest) and maximal heart rate during CPET (HR max) (Table 2).
Furthermore, there was a trend towards an effect of training on
workload at respiratory compensation point (RCP), but no effects
on maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), first ventilatory threshold
(VT1) or maximal workload.
MRS results
Repeated measures MANOVA with group as between-subject
factor and time (pre, post) as within subject factor revealed a trend
towards
an
effect
of
training
on
NAA/tCr
and
NAA/tCho
concentrations (group × time: F(2,
50) = 2.2, P = 0.12, η2
p = 0.091).
Contrast analysis revealed a significant effect (P = 0.04, η2
p = 0.083)
for cerebral NAA/tCho for the training group as compared to the
control group, whereas there was no significant effect of training
on cerebral NAA/tCr concentrations (P = 0.40, η2
p = 0.004) (Table 3;
Figure 3). The significant group × time interaction of cerebral NAA/
tCho concentrations was mainly driven by a significant increase in
tCho/Cr in the waiting control group (P = 0.017, paired t-test),
whereas changes in the training group were not significant
(P = 0.52). However, no significant effect was observed for the
group × time interaction for the ratio of
31P MRS detectable
choline metabolites (GPC and PCho) to phosphocreatine (PCr) and
no increase of these ratios was observed for both groups.
Potential changes in energy metabolism may lead to concen-
tration changes in the high-energy phosphate compounds PCr
and ATP. To detect these changes, we calculated the signal
intensity ratio of both compounds to the Pi signal intensity. No
significant changes (Po0.05) were observed, either for the
group × time interaction nor for the concentration in any of the
groups.
qMRI results
Repeated measures ANOVA with time as within subject factor and
group as between-subject factor did not reveal an effect of
training on GM volume (group × time interaction, P40.05, FWE-
corrected). The longitudinal ROI analysis of left and right
hippocampus did not reveal an effect of training on grey matter
volume at the significance level of Po0.05, FWE-corrected either.
A subsequent repeated-measures MANOVA in SPSS 22 of the
extracted hippocampi volumes with group as between-subject
factor and time as within subject factor did not show an effect of
training on left and right hippocampal GM volume (group × time:
F = 1.33, P = 0.27). Follow-up univariate analysis (repeated-mea-
sures ANOVAs) neither showed an effect of training on left
hippocampal GM volume (group × time: F(1, 52) = 0.01, P = 0.92), nor
on right hippocampal GM volume (group × time: F (1, 52) = 1.75,
P = 0.192) (Table 3).
BDNF
Repeated measures ANOVA (group × time) did not show a
significant effect (P40.05) of aerobic exercise on serum BDNF
concentrations (Table 3).
Cognitive performance
Repeated measures ANOVA (group × time) did not reveal a
significant effect (P40.05) of aerobic exercise on any of the
cognitive domains that were assessed in this study (Table 2).

 Correlation of changes
Changes in VT1 were positively associated with changes in NAA/
tCho concentrations (r = 0.43, P = 0.021) in the exercise group, but
not in the waiting control group (P40.05).
DISCUSSION
Extending the findings of previous studies on young healthy
subjects,17 and a mixed population of healthy subjects and
schizophrenic patients,18 the present study shows effects of
aerobic exercise on markers of brain metabolism in healthy older
adults. We focused on a moderate-to-vigorous ergometer training
to
clearly
differentiate
physical
activity
from
other
brain-
stimulating factors and therefore chose an intervention that was
not very high on coordinative or cognitive demands. The
significant effect of aerobic exercise on physical fitness, shown
by increased cardiac efficiency in the intervention group during
exercise and at rest underlines the cardiovascular benefit of the
applied intervention. Our training regime aimed at high com-
pliance and feasibility for elderly subjects. Similar to other studies,
investigating the effect of a comparable amount and intensity of
aerobic exercise on cerebral metabolism,17,18 the change in
physical fitness in the exercise group was not reflected in
significantly increased VO2max (which is often used as a primary
outcome for exercise effects on fitness), but rather in physiological
parameters measuring cardiac efficiency. Our results therefore
suggest that exercise effects seem to be mediated not only by
increased maximal aerobic capacity. The lack of an increase in
VO2max in the training group indicate, that 12 weeks of threshold-
based endurance training is not sufficient to increase VO2max in
elderly subjects.
Although there was no significant increase in VO2max, there
was an overall change in fitness level reflected in improved
cardiac efficiency in the training group. Moreover, changes in

 fitness level (VT1) were positively associated with changes in
metabolite concentrations (NAA/tCho) in the training group, thus
suggesting that fitness is closely linked to cerebral brain
metabolism. Overall, the currently available data indicate that
aerobic training interventions with moderate intensity may
improve both, brain metabolism and cardiopulmonary function.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that
regular aerobic exercise over 3 months leads to increased cerebral
NAA/tCho concentrations compared to a waiting control condi-
tion. The significant time × group interaction regarding the NAA/
tCho concentration can be mainly accounted for by the significant
increase in total choline (tCho/Cr) in the waiting control group.
Elevated tCho/Cr levels have been commonly found in patients
suffering from dementia, especially Alzheimer’s dementia and
dementia with Lewy bodies, which are characterised by choliner-
gic dysfunction.32–35 The elevation of tCho/Cr has been inter-
preted as a sign of increased membrane turnover due to
degeneration and a marker of cholinergic dysfunction.33,35 Thus,
our finding of increased tCho/Cr in the waiting control group but
not in the training group could be interpreted as a neuroprotec-
tive effect of regular aerobic exercise by possibly slowing down
neurodegeneration. Contrary to our hypothesis, the increase of
NAA/tCho in the training group was not paralleled by plasma
BDNF levels. Also, there was no training-associated increase in
NAA/Cr levels. Cross-sectional studies have shown that higher
aerobic fitness is associated with higher NAA/Cr levels.5,36
However, longitudinal studies on the effect of training on cerebral
NAA/Cr levels have produced different results. Pajonk et al.18
found an increase of NAA/Cr in schizophrenic patients after
3 months of aerobic exercise, but not in healthy subjects. Similarly,
and in line with our results, Wagner et al.17 found no increase of
NAA/Cr in young healthy adults after 6 weeks of aerobic exercise.
Overall, the lack of increase in NAA/Cr levels does not suggest
enhanced neuronal viability following aerobic exercise.
Contrary to our hypothesis, markers of neuronal energy reserve
did not increase. This may be due to the fact that potential
concentration changes are too small for detection with 31P MRS,
especially, as an improved energy metabolism may rather increase
turnover rate of the respective metabolites, whereas concentra-
tions are kept at the regular values.
Similar to the study by Erickson et al.4 and Mass et al.,20 we did
not find an increase in BDNF in the exercise group compared to
the control group. Overall, studies have shown heterogeneous
results with regard to the effect of exercise on serum BDNF
levels.37 A recent meta-analysis of Dinoff et al.37 examined the
effect of exercise training on resting concentrations of peripheral
BDNF. Of the 29 studies that were included into the meta-analysis,
only 9 studies reported a significant exercise-induced increase in
resting peripheral BDNF concentrations, whereas 20 studies
reported no significant change. Thus, there are no consistent
findings regarding the effect of exercise on resting peripheral
BDNF concentrations.
Structural results
In the present study, aerobic exercise did not lead to increased
total grey matter volume, nor increases in grey matter volume in
left or right hippocampus. In contrast to our study, a number of
trials have reported increases in hippocampal grey matter volume
following aerobic exercise (for example, refs 4,38). A possible

Effects of exercise on brain metabolism and volume

 explanation for the contradictory findings might be the overall
duration of the intervention period. Although the training load per
week was almost comparable, participants in the Erickson4 study
exercised for 1 year. Therefore, the slight changes in hippocampal
volume (~1.4% decrease in the control group, and ~ 2% increase
in the intervention group) found by Erickson et al.4 might be
attributable to the longer training interval. In other words, a
3 month intervention as in our study might not be sufficient to
enhance neurogenesis and promote angiogenesis in the hippo-
campus to an extent that can be measured with common analyses
methods such as voxel-based morphometry. This assumption is
supported by studies with shorter intervention periods (for
example, 6 weeks) that also failed to show effects of aerobic
exercise on hippocampal morphology.17
Another difference of our study compared to the study by
Erickson et al. lies in the age of the participants: 67.6 vs 73.3 years
in our study. Increasing age seems to be negatively related to
perfusion changes in the hippocampus following exercise.20 More
specifically, a study by Mass et al.38 could show that individuals
between 60 and 70 years tended towards perfusion increases as a
result of exercise, whereas older participants tended toward
decreases. As participants in our study were on average older than
70 years, they might have responded with decreased perfusion in
the hippocampus following exercise. As hippocampal perfusion is

concentrations. The figure depicts box-and-whisker plots with
maximum, minimum and median. There was a significant group ×
time interaction (P = 0.04) for cerebral NAA/tCho. The significant
interaction of cerebral NAA/tCho concentrations was mainly driven
by an increase of tCho/Cr in the waiting control group (P = 0.017,
paired t-test), whereas changes in the training group were not
significant (P = 0.52).

 closely linked to hippocampal volume,20 decreased perfusion rates
might explain why exercise did not lead to an increase in
hippocampal grey matter volume. Lastly, the method used in our
study to quantify hippocampal volume might not have been
refined enough to detect subtle alterations. Manual segmentation
(instead of automated segmentation as in our study) of the
hippocampus combined with a high resolution (7 Tesla in the
Maass et al.38 study as compared to 3 Tesla in our study) is more
likely to allow the detection of subtle, region-specific changes in
hippocampal volume. This assumption is supported by the
findings of Erickson et al.4 and Mass et al.38 that have shown
most pronounced changes of hippocampal volume in anterior
hippocampus and hippocampal head. As we did not analyse
specific subregions of the hippocampus, we might have missed
region-specific subtle changes.
Cognitive performance
There was no significant effect of the aerobic exercise intervention
on any of the cognitive domains (verbal declarative memory,
frontal executive control, working memory, semantic and phone-
matic fluency as well as nonverbal declarative memory) assessed
in this study. This finding is in line with other studies that did not
find an immediate specific effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive
performance.4,38 Thus, it appears that the protective effects of
physical activity on cognitive health that have been shown by
numerous studies39,40 are rather explained by a slowdown of age-
related cognitive decline than by an improvement of cognition
after a relatively short intervention period.
Limitations
Limitations of our study include the relatively short intervention
period of only 3 months and the rather small sample size.
Negative findings for cerebral energy metabolism, brain structure
and cognitive performance could relate to the duration of the
training period. Furthermore, the sample size might have been too
small to reach sufficient statistical power, in particular, to detect
significant group × time interactions. Future studies involving
larger sample sizes and long-term interventions are needed to
reassess the effect of exercise on cerebral energy metabolism,
brain structure and cognitive performance.
Finally, one can question the rationale of an incremental step
CPET
protocol
instead of
a ramp
protocol
to
assess
the
cardiopulmonary endpoints. Both protocol types adequately
determine the peak physiologic responses, so that the choice of
protocol for the measurement of maximal exercise capacity
remains one of laboratory preference.41 We used 25 W steps to
attenuate sudden alterations in metabolism and motor unit
recruitment, and to strengthen the relationship between VO2 and
work rate.42 There is considerable inter‐ and intraobserver
variability in the visual detection of the onset of anaerobic
metabolism from the breath‐by‐breath data.43 Therefore, visual
detection was performed by two researchers independently and
differences were reviewed by a third person.
CONCLUSION
A 12-week aerobic exercise training in cognitively healthy older
adults resulted in stable concentrations of cerebral tCho, whereas
tCho levels increased in waiting controls. As choline is a marker of
neurodegeneration, this finding suggests a neuroprotective effect
of aerobic exercise. Overall, our findings indicate that cerebral
tCho might constitute a valid marker for an effect of aerobic
exercise on the brain in healthy aging.
