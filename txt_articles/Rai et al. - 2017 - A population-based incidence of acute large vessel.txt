ABSTRACT
Background Data on large vessel strokes are
important for resource allocation and infrastructure
development.
Objective To determine an annual incidence of large
vessel occlusions (LVOs) and a thrombectomy eligible
patient population.
Methods All patients with acute ischemic stroke
discharged over 3 years from a tertiary-level hospital
serving a large geographic area were evaluated for an
LVO (M1, internal carotid artery terminus, basilar artery).
The incidence of LVO was determined for the hospital’s
4-county primary service area (PSA, population 210 000)
based on each county’s discharges and extrapolated to
the US population. ‘Thrombectomy eligibility’ for anterior
circulation LVOs was based on time (onset <6 hours)
and imaging (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score
(ASPECTS) ≥6). The number of annual thrombectomy
procedures was calculated for Medicare and private
payer patients using federally available databases.
Results 1157 patients were discharged from the
hospital’s PSA, of whom 129 (11.1%, 95% CI 9.5%
to 13.1%) had an LVO. This translated into an LVO
incidence of 24 per 100 000 people per year (95% CI
20 to 28). 20 per 100 000 people per year had anterior
circulation LVOs (95% CI 19 to 22), of whom
10/100 000/year (95% CI 8 to 11) were ‘thrombectomy
eligible’. An additional 5/100 000/year (95% CI 3 to 6)
presented with favorable ASPECTS after 6 hours of
symptom onset. Basilar occlusion incidence was
estimated at 4/100 000/year (95% CI 2 to 5). These
rates yield 77 569 (95% CI 65 835 to 91 091) new
LVOs per year in the USA. An estimated 10 284
mechanical thrombectomy procedures were performed in
2015.
Conclusions This study estimates an LVO incidence
of 24 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 20 to 28).
A current estimated annual thrombectomy rate of three
procedures per 100 000 people indicates significant
potential increase in the volume of endovascular
procedures and the need to develop systems of care.
INTRODUCTION
The current emphasis in stroke treatment is on
developing systems of care which disseminate endo-
vascular therapy. An accurate assessment of the size
of the patient population who might benefit from
endovascular care is an important initial step in
defining the scope of the problem. The oft-quoted
statistic of ∼795 000 acute strokes with an esti-
mated 87% ischemic, or 691 650 patients, is extra-
polated
from
regional
population
studies
and
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke projections.1 Although important as an indi-
cator of the total disease burden, these numbers are
less relevant for determining the incidence of large
vessel strokes, which are probably responsible for
the bulk of morbidity, mortality, and cost associated
with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Information about
this target population that has been shown to
benefit from endovascular therapy is limited.2–5
This paper aimed to estimate the number of
patients with stroke presenting with large vessel
occlusions (LVOs). W
e initially determined the
acute LVO rate among all patients presenting with
AIS to a large tertiary level hospital in northern
W
est Virginia, which receives almost all the patients
with stroke from its primary catchment population.
W
e used these results to estimate the rate of acute
LVO for the primary population and stratified it
based on time from symptom onset and favorable
versus unfavorable imaging. The population-based
incidence calculated from the hospital’s service area
was used to estimate the national incidence of LVO.
The estimated rate of LVO and the current thromb-
ectomy volume suggest the potential opportunity
for endovascular stroke therapy and can serve as a
marker
for
assessing
dissemination
of
these
services.
METHODS
Determining the incidence of large vessel
strokes among all AIS discharges from the
tertiary hospital
All
patients
discharged
from
hospital
with
a
primary or secondary diagnosis of AIS based on
ICD-9 diagnosis codes 433.xx (Occlusion and sten-
osis of precerebral arteries), 434.xx (Occlusion of
cerebral arteries), and 435.xx (Transient cerebral
ischemia) from an academic tertiary-level hospital
in a rural setting over a 3-year period (March
2012–March 2015) were evaluated for the pres-
ence of an LVO. W
e used a 3-year cycle to smooth
out year-to-year variations. The ≈700 bed hospital
has a four-county primary service area (PSA) in
northern W
est Virginia, with a 2013 population of
almost 210 000 in an area of 1492 square miles.

 The total number of patients discharged from each county is
reported to the W
est Virginia Healthcare Authority. The hospital
received about 85% of patients with stroke discharged from the
PSA in 2013, representing a fair estimation of the ischemic
stroke burden in its catchment population. The hospital also
received about 50% of patients with stroke discharged from its
11-county secondary service area (SSA), with a population of
almost 213 000 in an area of 5233 square miles. Additionally,
the hospital receives patients with stroke from adjacent counties
in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio.
A total of 2798 patients with a primary or secondary diagno-
sis of ischemic stroke were discharged from hospital over the
3-year period. A baseline vascular imaging study was available
in 2739 (98%) patients, who formed the cohort for this ana-
lysis. An emergent CT angiogram was performed in 2490
(90.9%) and an emergent MR angiogram in 249 (9.1%)
patients. An LVO was defined as middle cerebral artery main
stem (M1) with or without involvement of the bifurcation
branches, internal carotid artery terminus arteries (ICA-T), or
basilar artery (BA). T
wo experienced neuroradiologists inde-
pendently assessed a baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT
Score (ASPECTS) for all patients with anterior circulation LVO
on the corresponding non-contrast CT or MRI diffusion-
weighted images. The results were dichotomized into favorable
(ASPECTS ≥6) or unfavorable (ASPECTS <6) for intervention
and any discrepant results between the two reviewers were
resolved by consensus. Thus we estimated the percentage of
LVOs among all discharged patients with ischemic stroke and
stratified the results based on the service area, presentation time
from
symptom
onset,
and
treatment
eligibility
based
on
ASPECTS.
Estimating the incidence of large vessel strokes among
the primary service population
As previously mentioned, total hospital discharges from each
county are reported to the W
est Virginia Healthcare Authority
(http://www.hca.wv.gov/). In 2013, the hospital received 85% of
all patients with stroke from its PSA and, by accounting for the
remaining 15%, we estimated an annual rate of large vessel
strokes per 100 000 people. Using the 2015 US population of
∼322 000 000, we extrapolated our results to generate rates and
ranges of annual LVO incidence nationally and stratified these
rates based on time of presentation and imaging.
Estimating the numbers of mechanical thrombectomy
cases for 2015
The mechanical thrombectomy numbers for 2015 were esti-
mated based on counts calculated from the Medicare Provider
Analysis and Review (MedPAR) fiscal year (FY) 2015 data (FY
2017 proposed rule file) and adjusted to national counts using
the 2013 National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) of the
Agency for Healthcare Research, Quality Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project (HCUP), Rockville, Maryland, USA (http://
www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/nisoverview.jsp). Mechanical thrombec-
tomy cases were defined based on ischemic stroke diagnosis
(ICD-9 433.xx, 434.xx, 435.xx) and ICD-9-CM procedure
code 39.74 (Endovascular removal of obstruction from head
and neck vessel(s)). The count of traditional Medicare dis-
charges from MedPAR was inflated to total including Medicare
Advantage Part C using an estimate of 30% enrollment in Part
C. In the 2013 NIS, Medicare represented 58.7% of all mech-
anical
thrombectomy
cases.
W
e
estimated
the
total
2015
thrombectomy cases by inflating the FY2015 Medicare cases
using this ratio of Medicare to private payer cases from HCUP
.
The NIS is approximately a 20% stratified sample of patients
discharged from US hospitals, excluding rehabilitation and long-
term acute care hospitals, and contains all-payer data on hospital
inpatient stays from states participating in HCUP
. The hospitals
are stratified based on bed size, geographical region, teaching
status, urban versus rural location, and profit versus non-profit
ownership. The NIS covers more than 95% of the US popula-
tion, with each year including over 7 million inpatient stays.
The self-weighting design of the newest NIS version (2013 and
later) delivers more stable and precise estimates than previous
versions (2012 and earlier).
Statistical analysis
The patient demographics, occlusion site, and stratification
based on time and imaging are descriptively presented and com-
pared. All data analysis was performed using JMP statistical soft-
ware, V
.11 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The
significance of simple bivariate associations was assessed using
Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, Student’s t-test for
continuous variables, or logistic regression, as appropriate.
RESULTS
Rate of LVO among AIS discharges from all geographic
locations
A total of 2739 patients with AIS were discharged from hospital
over the 3-year period. Of the 2691 patients for whom ethnicity
information was available, the majority were white/Caucasian
(n=2555, 94.9%). There were 1157 (42.2%) patients from the
PSA, 798 (29.1%) from the SSA, and 784 (28.6%) patients
from the rest of the state, neighboring counties from the sur-
rounding states, or patients traveling through from more distant
states. The mean age was 67.3 (±15.6) years and 1420 (51.8%)
were female. An LVO was present in 324 (11.8%, 95% CI
10.7% to 13.1%) patients of whom 232 (71.6%, 95% CI
66.5% to 77.2%) had an M1, 37 (11.4%, 95% CI 8.4% to
15.3%) had an ICA-T and 55 (17%, 95% CI 13.3% to 21.4%)
had a BA occlusion. The median National Institutes of Health
Stroke Scale score was 17 (IQR 9–21) for M1 occlusion, 21
(IQR 15–25) for ICA-T occlusion, and 16 (IQR 4–26) for a BA
occlusion (p=0.1). The majority of patients with LVO (174
(53.7%, 95% CI 48.3% to 59.1%)) presented within 6 hours of
symptom onset. Forty-four (13.6%, 95% CI 10.3% to 17.8%)
patients presented within 6–12 hours, 87 (26.9%, 95% CI
22.3% to 31.9%) after 12 hours, and 19 (5.9%, 95% CI 3.8%
to 9%) patients presented with an unknown time of symptom
onset. Of the 269 patients with an anterior circulation LVO,
150 (55.8%, 95% CI 49.8% to 61.2%) presented within
6 hours of symptom onset and 184 (68.4%, 95% CI 62.6 to
73.7) patients presented with an ASPECTS ≥6. Among the 184
patients with favorable ASPECTS ≥6, 121 (65.8%, 95% CI
58.6% to 72.2%) presented within 6 hours of symptom onset
and 63 (34.2%, 95% CI 27.8% to 41.4%) after 6 hours
(p<0.0001, OR=0.27, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.46).
There was no difference in the rate of LVO based on the
geographic location: an LVO was confirmed in 129 (11.1%)
patients from the PSA, 97 (12.2%) from the SSA, and 98
(12.5%) patients from other regions (p=0.12). A comparison
of the presenting time from symptom onset and ASPECTS
based on region (table 1) demonstrated that more patients
from the PSA, SSA, or immediately adjacent counties of
Pennsylvania presented within 6 hours symptom onset and
had favorable ASPECTS than those presenting from more
distant regions.

 Incidence of LVOs based on the PSA
Of the 1157 patients with AIS discharged from the PSA over
the 3 years, 129 had an LVO (11.1%, 95% CI 9.5% to 13.1%).
The distribution of clot location was M1 in 102 patients
(79.1%, 95% CI 71.3% to 85.2%), ICA-T in seven patients
(5.4%, 95% CI 2.7% to 10.8%), and BA in 20 patients (15.5%,
95% CI 10.3% to 22.7%). Based on time, 75 patients (58.1%,
95% CI 49.5% to 66.3%) presented within 6 hours and
54 patients (41.9%, 95% CI 33.7% to 50.5%) presented after
6 hours of symptom onset. Of the 109 patients with an anterior
circulation occlusion, 80 (73.4%, 95% CI 64.4% to 80.8%)
presented with an ASPECTS ≥6 and 29 (26.6%, 95% CI 19.2%
to 35.6%) with an ASPECTS <6.
As mentioned all counties in the service areas report their
annual discharges to the W
est Virginia Healthcare Authority.
Thus based on the PSA population of 210 000, from the hospi-
tal’s 85% share of patients with stroke from the PSA and by
accounting for the remaining 15%, we estimated an incidence
of 24 (95% CI 20 to 28) LVOs per 100 000 people per year.
A breakup of the rate per 100 000 person-years based on time,
clot location and ASPECTS is presented in table 2 together with
an estimation of total numbers in each category for the US
population for 2015. The results yield an estimated 695 712
total cases of AIS for the USA, of which potentially 77 569
(95% CI 65 835 to 91 091) are LVOs (ICA-T
, M1, BA). W
e
estimated that 10 284 mechanical thrombectomy procedures
were performed in 2015 based on the previously described
methodology.
DISCUSSION
This analysis yields an annual incidence of 24 LVOs (ICA-T
, M1,
BA) per 100 000 people (95% CI 9.5 to 13.1) based on the
study’s population, which is within a geographic region that has
one of the highest stroke rates in the country.1 The extrapolated
national incidence of 77 569 (95% CI 65 835 to 91 091) new
LVOs per year thus probably represents the upper bounds of
annual large vessel stroke estimates in the country. Since the
total AIS estimate of 695 712 patients in this study (table 2) is
close to the 691 650 estimate of patients with AIS generated
from previous statistics,1 the estimated annual LVO burden is
likely to be realistic. The 11% rate of LVO strokes in this cohort
was based on all hospital discharges for AIS using the same
ICD-9 codes that are typically used to determine the rate of
ischemic stroke admissions—that is, ICD-9 433, 434, and 435.
One previous study6 determined a higher rate of LVO among
patients admitted with suspected stroke. However, since the esti-
mates were based on clinically suspected strokes at admission
and not all AIS discharges based on ICD-9 codes, the denomin-
ator might be smaller. That study also did not include a
population analysis. The 11% rate in this study is based on the
primary service population of 210 000 people spread over 1492
square miles and living within 40 miles of the tertiary referral
hospital. This may be a useful number for hospitals of similar
size and rural geography to gauge their potential LVO popula-
tion; however, application of the results to smaller or urban hos-
pitals may not be accurate owing to different referral pathways.
An
population
eligible
for
endovascular
treatment
for
anterior circulation LVOs based on the recent randomized clin-
ical trials2–5 criteria of early presentation from symptom onset
(<6 hours) and favorable imaging (ASPECTS ≥6) yielded poten-
tially 10 treatment eligible LVO cases per 100 000 person-years
(95% CI 8 to 11). However, in the study population there were
an additional five patients per 100 000 (95% CI 3 to 6) with an
ASPECTS ≥6 presenting after 6 hours who might benefit from
an intervention. Five patients per 100 000 had a BA occlusion
that could also be treated but their eligibility based on imaging
was not assessed and so the true number is likely to be lower
since some would present with completed infarcts incompatible
with survival or a good outcome. Our assessment of these
potential patients is very similar to a recent publication from
Australia that estimated potential endovascular thrombectomy
to range from 11 (95% CI 4 to 18) to 22 (95% CI 13 to 31)
patients per 100 000 person-years based on the restrictiveness
of the inclusion criteria.7
T
rue treatment eligibility could be lower than these estimates
because patients with significant comorbidities, poor baseline
functional status, or unfavorable vascular anatomy are not
accounted for and can lower the target population. On the
other hand, inclusion of patients with dominant M2 division
occlusion can increase the target population. Additionally, mea-
sures that improve early detection of large vessel strokes, such as
mobile CT scanners or portable devices that detect cerebral
blood flow (or lack of it), may allow for early diversion of
patients to a comprehensive treatment center. Similarly, consist-
ently efficient interfacility transfer mechanisms may enable
patients to reach a hospital delivering endovascular care earlier.
Such division of labor among hospital systems can allow for
appropriate and targeted allocation of resources. Within the
comprehensive hospital, reducing door-to-needle times by fol-
lowing protocol-driven processes8 may further increase treat-
ment effectiveness. W
e had a higher percentage of patients from
the closer proximity PSA presenting within 6 hours of symptom
onset with favorable imaging than patients coming from further
away. Other studies have also shown a decay in ASPECTS
during patient interfacility transfer.9 The hospital system in this
study is constantly developing resources and capacity to stay
ahead of the projected demand based on its referral network. In
the future, elements of neuroprotection10

The study yielded an estimated 10 284 mechanical thrombec-
tomy procedures for 2015. This is based on Medicare data and
private payer estimates generated from MedPAR and HCUP that
include the NIS. Medicare data are fairly accurate because they
are obtained from patient files submitted to Medicare by the
hospitals. This is similar to an estimate based on informal sam-
pling of busy stroke centers and their catchment population of
about 10 000 annual procedures.14 Nevertheless, this probably
represents an underestimation of the real procedure volume as it
does not account for any coding errors. Industry projections
could be higher based on device sales and proprietary third
party appraisals but might also overestimate the market based
on inflated assumptions. Our estimate of 10 284 mechanical
thrombectomy procedures would translate into three thrombec-
tomy procedures per 100 000 people for 2015. A hypothetical
estimate of 15 000 and 20 000 thrombectomy procedures for
2015 is equivalent to 4.6 and 6 procedures per 100 000 people,
respectively. A range of 3–6 annual thrombectomy procedures
per 100 000 person-years is still less than the potential stroke
interventions that can be performed just for the ‘thrombectomy
eligible’
population
proved
to
benefit
from
endovascular
therapy. By eliminating time from patient selection and focusing
only on favorable imaging there could be as many as 15 thromb-
ectomy eligible patients per 100 000 person-years in those with
an anterior circulation occlusion alone. Including treatment eli-
gible posterior circulation strokes and M2 occlusions further
increases this number. Thus a current annual rate of 3–6
thrombectomy procedures per 100 000 people suggests a two-
to fivefold increase in the potential volume of endovascular
stroke interventions.
Patients with large vessel stroke are thus currently under-
served. This is not necessarily due to the lack of a trained phys-
ician workforce15–17 but perhaps more due to prehospital and
intrahospital systems of care that need further development.
The strong evidence in favor of intervening in patients with
LVOs will probably enhance these care pathways, increase
patient awareness, and increase acceptance of these procedures
as the standard of care. An initial goal could be to reach 10
stroke interventions per 100 000 people per year to at least
treat those patients who have been shown to benefit the most.
Some centers could be meeting or exceeding this target for their
catchment population now, whereas others could use this goal
as a marker to measure progress in disseminating this care.
Perhaps parallel progress in emergency medical services, early
diagnosis and neuroprotection could accelerate these next steps
in evolution of stroke care.
One important point to keep in mind as this care evolves is
the realistic and perhaps cautionary trend observed in similar
stages of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) develop-
ment.
In
the
Global
Registry of
Acute
Coronary
Events
(GRACE) about 30% of patients with acute coronary syndrome
admitted within 12 hours of symptom onset underwent PCIs.18
Other studies have reported a rate of 46–75% rate of coronary
interventions for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarc-
tion (STEMI).18–21 The GRACE registry also showed that
between 1999 and 2006, primary PCIs for patients admitted
with STEMI grew at about 30% for the first 2 years, 19% for
the next 2 years, and dropped to an average of 9% for the last
2 years22 and has declined further since then.23 24 It is also
important to note that even the steepest upslope of the acute
coronary intervention era did not reach an annual 30% growth
rate and that too only for the initial years. This is despite

The first row represents the cumulative 3-year rate of acute ischemic strokes (AIS) and LVO strokes in the hospital’s four-county primary service area (PSA) with a population of 210 000. Results are stratified based on clot location and time from symptom
onset for the entire cohort. Patients with anterior circulation LVO are separately stratified based on time from symptom onset (T) and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) (A). The thrombectomy eligible population is defined by patients
presenting within 6 hours of symptoms onset with an ASPECTS ≥6.
The second row represents estimates of the annual LVO incidence per 100 000 people and is similarly stratified based on clot location, time from symptom onset, and ASPECTS.
In the third row, these results are extended to the US population for 2015 to generate the total number of possible patients with LVO and estimates for each subgroup.

 significant efforts by the American Heart Association to develop
systems of care, raise public awareness, and set treatment guide-
lines. Thus it is prudent to recognize that we will never treat
every eligible patient with LVO and account for the inherent
limitations
within
any
healthcare
system
when
projecting
volumes and developing infrastructure.
Limitations
The 11% LVO rate among all AIS admissions represents data
from a large, academic tertiary-level hospital in a rural geo-
graphic area. This rate may be different for smaller hospitals or
those in an urban environment. Thus universal application of
this LVO rate could be misleading unless other variables are
taken into account. The general incidence and prevalence of AIS
also varies from region to region and the LVO rate estimated in
our primary population may be different from that in another.
However, based on the above average stroke incidence in our
state, the calculated LVO incidence based on our population
probably constitutes the upper limits of these estimates.
Treatment eligibility based on time from symptom onset can
also vary according to regional resources and patient transfer
mechanisms. A rural area such as ours with one large tertiary
center receiving the bulk of patients with AIS may have a differ-
ent stratification of patients than centers in large urban environ-
ments or centers receiving a large amount of transfers from
more distant smaller hospitals.
A limitation of our methodology in estimating numbers of
mechanical thrombectomy procedures is that the HCUP data we
used are from 2013 since the 2014 data are not available until
the fall of 2016 according to the NIS. HCUP data always lag
behind Medicare data and therefore our calculated numbers
probably underestimate the true procedure volume. For this
reason, in our discussion we include a range up to twice the
volume of our estimation to compare the LVO incidence with
treated patients and to assess the potential growth in thrombec-
tomy procedures.
CONCLUSIONS
The incidence of acute LVO confirmed by imaging was esti-
mated to be 24 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 20 to 28),
which is in keeping with a similar recent publication.7 This
translates into 77 569 (95% CI 65 835 to 91 091) potential new
patients with LVO per year in the USA, based on the 2015
population. This estimate may be reasonable as the total cases of
AIS estimated in this population-based study of 695 712 is very
similar to the 691 650 AIS estimate from the American Heart
Association publication.1 Thrombectomy eligible patients with
an anterior circulation occlusion were estimated at 10 per
100 000 person-years with an additional treatment eligible five
patients per 100 000 person-years presenting with favorable
imaging after 6 hours of symptom onset and four patients per
100 000
person-years
presenting
with
BA
occlusion.
This
number does not include potentially treatable M2 occlusions.
Thus the total number of thrombectomy eligible patients could
range from 10 to 20 patients per 100 000 person-years. An esti-
mated range of 10 000–20 000 annual thrombectomy proce-
dures yields 3–6 mechanical thrombectomies per 100 000
person-years, indicating a significant potential for growth. The
history of coronary interventions illustrates that it will be impos-
sible to treat every eligible patient despite all possible efforts;
however, developing systems of care can steadily increase the
proportion of eligible patients who are treated and these esti-
mates can serve as markers for gauging progress.
