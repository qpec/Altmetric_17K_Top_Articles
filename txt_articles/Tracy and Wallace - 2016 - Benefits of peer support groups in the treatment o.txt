Objective: Peer support can be defined as the process of giving and receiving nonprofessional, 
nonclinical assistance from individuals with similar conditions or circumstances to achieve 
long-term recovery from psychiatric, alcohol, and/or other drug-related problems. Recently, 
there has been a dramatic rise in the adoption of alternative forms of peer support services to 
assist recovery from substance use disorders; however, often peer support has not been sepa-
rated out as a formalized intervention component and rigorously empirically tested, making it 
difficult to determine its effects. This article reports the results of a literature review that was 
undertaken to assess the effects of peer support groups, one aspect of peer support services, in 
the treatment of addiction.
Methods: The authors of this article searched electronic databases of relevant peer-reviewed 
research literature including PubMed and MedLINE.
Results: Ten studies met our minimum inclusion criteria, including randomized controlled trials 
or pre-/post-data studies, adult participants, inclusion of group format, substance use-related, 
and US-conducted studies published in 1999 or later. Studies demonstrated associated benefits 
in the following areas: 1) substance use, 2) treatment engagement, 3) human immunodeficiency 
virus/hepatitis C virus risk behaviors, and 4) secondary substance-related behaviors such as crav-
ing and self-efficacy. Limitations were noted on the relative lack of rigorously tested empirical 
studies within the literature and inability to disentangle the effects of the group treatment that 
is often included as a component of other services.
Conclusion: Peer support groups included in addiction treatment shows much promise; however, 
the limited data relevant to this topic diminish the ability to draw definitive conclusions. More 
rigorous research is needed in this area to further expand on this important line of research.
Keywords: behavioral treatment, mentorship, substance use, alcohol, drugs, recovery
Introduction
Peer support can be defined as the process of giving and receiving nonprofessional, 
nonclinical assistance from individuals with similar conditions or circumstances to 
achieve long-term recovery from psychiatric, alcohol, and/or other drug-related prob-
lems. Historically, peer support has been shown to be a key component of many existing 
addiction treatment and recovery approaches such as the community reinforcement 
approach,1–11 therapeutic communities,12,13 and 12-step programs;14,15 the community 
reinforcement approach has demonstrated the importance of valued social roles in 
maintaining abstinence, which is the foundation of the peer support relationship.16–18
Varying approaches that include a mixture of services such as peer support groups, 
individual counseling, and case management have emerged as a highly effective and

empowering method to manage the social context of health 
issues and are particularly popular in the substance abuse and 
mental health fields.19 As it relates to substance abuse recovery 
for individuals and families, addiction peer support services 
have emerged across time due to the shift from a biopsycho-
social approach to a sustained recovery  
management approach 
to treat addictions.20 While in many cases, peer support groups 
do not replace the need for formal treatments or supervisory 
clinical guidance due to peers not having sufficient training 
to manage psychiatric conditions or high-risk situations, they 
still offer an augmentation to treatment that provides many 
benefits to individuals with substance use disorders.21
Terminology
Various terminologies are used interchangeably within the 
literature to describe peer-related support and contexts. For 
the purposes of this article, we attempted to utilize consistent 
language wherever possible. However, in certain instances, 
a term may be part of a broader term such as mentorship is 
a type of peer support, but mentorship is specific to an indi-
vidual in later recovery providing peer support to someone in 
earlier recovery, which requires additional specification.21 We 
adapted and built upon White’s20 definition of peer support to 
include individuals with similar conditions or circumstances 
and inclusion of recovery from psychiatric problems in 
addition to substance use disorders. We also included this 
broadened scope in our definition of peer mentorship. Table 1 
provides key peer support terms used throughout this review 
article and definitions.22–24
Residential and sober living
Since the 1960s, a variety of residential options have emerged 
to help people with alcohol and drug addictions. These pro-
grams based on the social model of recovery provide support 
for people in recovery from alcohol addiction in a residential 
environment that focuses on Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) 
philosophy and practices.25 AA practice follows the 12-step 
guidelines based on spiritual principles and the assumption 
that addiction is a disease.26 Prior work utilizing social model 
programs can be found as early as the 1940s.27–29 The types 
of social model programs available include social setting 
detoxification, residential social model recovery programs, 
neighborhood recovery centers, and sober living houses.27
Sober living houses are alcohol- and drug-free living 
environments for a group of peers in recovery. Utilizing a 
peer-oriented social model modality, sober living houses 
rely on mutual sobriety support, self-efficacy, and resident 
participation. California Sober Living Houses and Oxford 
Houses are two variations of sober living houses.30–32  
Previous 
studies have shown sober living houses to be beneficial33 and 
effective34,35 in assisting in the reduction of substance use. 
For example, Jason et al35 conducted a randomized study to 
test the efficacy of an Oxford House intervention compared 
to usual care (ie, outpatient treatment or self-help groups) 
following discharge from inpatient substance abuse treat-
ment. Results demonstrated a significant increase in monthly 
income with a significant decrease in substance use and 
incarceration rates among those in the Oxford House condi-
tion compared with the usual-care condition.
12-step
Some of the most popular peer support groups held outside 
the formal treatment settings for addiction nationwide include 
12-step programs such as AA, Narcotics Anonymous, and 
Cocaine Anonymous. Twelve-step is an intervention for drug 
abuse and addiction and can include dual recovery from 
substance abuse problems and co-occurring mental health 
disorders. Humphreys36 found 12-step groups to be the most 
referred adjunct support for professionally treated substance 
abuse patients. Other studies have demonstrated the effective-
ness of 12-step groups for the treatment of substance abuse 
following treatment,37–39 and prior research of 12-step groups 
has shown reductions in alcohol and drug use.40–42

Benefits of peer support groups in the treatment of addiction
AA has been shown to be a highly utilized interven-
tion for individuals with alcohol problems.43–45 Positive 
outcomes such as self-efficacy and healthy coping have 
been  
associated with AA affiliation, which has been linked 
to better outcomes.37,46 For those with drinking problems 
seen in treatment, certain AA activities such as having a 
sponsor and doing service might be key components of 
abstinence.47
In a focused review of the literature on AA effective-
ness, six criteria were required for establishing causation: 1) 
magnitude of effect; 2) dose–response effect; 3) consistent 
effect; 4) temporally accurate effects; 5) specific effects, and 
6) plausibility. The evidence for all criteria except specific 
effects was very strong. For magnitude, rates of abstinence 
within AA were approximately twice as high. For dose–
response, higher rates of abstinence were related to higher 
levels of attendance. For consistency, the effects were found 
for different follow-up periods and different samples. For 
temporal, prior AA attendance is predictive of subsequent 
abstinence. For plausibility, mechanisms of action predicted 
by behavioral change theories were present in AA. However, 
for specificity of an effect for 12-step facilitation or AA, 
experimental evidence was mixed, with evidence for both 
positive and negative effects in addition to no effect.48
Although the peer support groups within 12-step 
approaches have provided benefits to select populations, some 
individuals with substance use disorders find the religious 
nature of 12-step approaches and often lack of integration 
in the treatment setting to be a deterrent.49–51 Alternatives 
to 12-step approaches are needed to more closely integrate 
peer support services within treatment and to provide more 
options to benefit from peer support groups.
Treatment and community settings
Recently, there has been a dramatic rise in the adoption of 
alternative forms of peer support services within treatment 
and community settings to assist recovery from substance 
use disorders, because of the potential benefits offered to 
patients.52 However, often peer support has not been sepa-
rated out as a formalized intervention component and rigor-
ously empirically tested, making it difficult to determine its 
effects.53
Peer support is delivered in a variety of modalities, 
including, but not limited to, in-person self-help groups, 
Internet support groups, peer run or operated services, peer 
partnerships, peers in health care settings who serve as peer 
advocates, peer specialists, and peer case managers.54 Among 
peer support services available today, peer support groups 
are considered an important aspect of the addiction recovery 
process.55–58
Previous studies have shown positive outcomes from 
participating in peer support groups. Active engagement 
in peer support groups has shown to be a key predictor 
of recovery,56,59,60 and sustaining recovery.61–63 In addition, 
evidence demonstrates that one’s belief in their own abil-
ity can increase and influence one’s behavior by watching 
other peoples’ behaviors (ie, performing activities).64 There 
is a mutual benefit between the members and facilitators of 
peer support groups. Oftentimes, peer support groups are 
facilitated by peer workers who themselves are in recovery 
and benefit positively from peer support groups.21 Benefits 
for the peer worker include increased self-esteem, confidence, 
positive feelings of accomplishment, and an increase in their 
own ability to cope with their challenges.
Existing systematic peer support reviews
Bassuk et al65 conducted a systematic review of the evi-
dence on the effectiveness of peer support services for 
people in recovery from alcohol and drug addiction, which 
resulted in nine studies meeting the criteria for inclusion 
in the review. Despite methodological limitations found 
in the studies, the body of evidence suggested beneficial 
effects on participants. In another systematic review, Reif 
et al66 evaluated peer support services for individuals with 
substance use disorders resulting in ten studies. The stud-
ies demonstrated increased treatment retention, improved 
relationships with treatment providers and social supports, 
increased satisfaction, and reduced relapse rates. Similar 
to the other reviews, there were methodological limitations 
that included inability to distinguish the effects of peer 
recovery support from other recovery support activities, 
small sample sizes and heterogeneous populations, unclear 
or inconsistent outcomes, and lack of any or appropriate 
comparison groups. Both of these reviews included peer 
support services in general without a specific focus on peer 
support groups and excluded studies with substance-using 
populations with a primary focus on human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) risk behavior 
outcomes. In addition, 12-step peer support studies were 
excluded.
This article reports the results of a literature review that 
was undertaken to assess the use of peer support groups, one 
aspect of peer recovery support services, in the treatment of 
addiction. In reporting the outcomes related to this review, the 
authors intend to: 1) encourage the field to generate further 
research to more rigorously investigate the effectiveness of

peer support groups and explore the multitude of other spe-
cific types of peer recovery support services and 2) provide 
greater awareness to the advantages of peer support integra-
tion within the substance use treatment continuum for adults 
with addiction problems.
Methods
To effectively complete the review, the authors used a 
combination of searches on electronic scientific databases 
and screening results cross-checking the eligibility criteria 
to reduce the number of studies included in this article. At 
certain points, the authors independently cross-checked 
the results. If there was a discrepancy, further information 
was gathered to make an accurate determination of how to 
proceed. The process is described later and summarized in 
Figure 1.
Study identification and screening: Phase I
The authors of this article searched the electronic databases 
of relevant peer-reviewed research literature including 
PubMed and MedLINE. Because addiction is a broad term 
that can be applied to varying types of addiction beyond 
alcohol- and nonalcohol-related substances (eg, gambling, 
Internet, sex, and eating) that are unrelated to the scope 
of this article, “substance use disorders” was the primary 
terminology used in searches to yield records pertaining 
to alcohol and drug problems. The initial database search 
used keywords “substance use disorders and peer support”. 
We also cross-checked our inclusion list by running similar 
searches containing specific substance names as keywords 
(eg, cocaine, alcohol, and heroin) to ensure comprehensive-
ness. This resulted in 2,291 records.
Study identification and screening: Phase II
The following keywords were used to identify all articles 
associated with several domains: substance use disorders, 
peer support or peer mentorship, and intervention. Including 
the keyword “intervention” allowed for higher yielding of 
treatment studies. While critiquing and critically reviewing 
results within an article that included a systematic review of 
studies,66 we found three additional studies that met our inclu-
sion criteria, which were included.67–69 Using the keywords 
“substance use disorders and peer support and intervention”, 
461 records were found. Using the keyword “substance

Benefits of peer support groups in the treatment of addiction
use disorder and peer mentorship”, 24 records were found. 
Including three studies previously mentioned, a total of 488 
articles were screened for eligibility.
Initial eligibility
By design, this discussion is limited to studies that included a 
peer support group component that: 1) had adult participants; 
2) focused on addiction-related substance use (ie, alcohol, 
tobacco, legal/illicit drugs, and prescription drugs); 3) held 
in any group format; 4) included randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) or studies with pre- and post-data results, and 5) US-
conducted studies published in 1999 or later. Since certain 
groups (eg, HIV
, HCV
, and mental health) are at greater risk 
of having a substance use disorder, we did not exclude these 
populations.
As previously noted, the authors used keywords peer sup-
port or mentorship and substance use disorders to generate 
articles on the use of peer support groups within substance 
use disorder treatment to generate the initial pool of articles. 
We further narrowed our initial results in the current article 
to include only studies that focused on peer support group 
treatments. However, initially, we found that empirical stud-
ies assessing peer support groups solely were very limited 
and that our literature search would be much improved if 
we included not only peer support groups independently but 
also studies that integrated peer support groups as a compo-
nent of a larger spectrum of peer services offered. We also 
included traditional forms of peer support services such as 
12-step in addition to including any recent advancements 
within the field.
All study types that were not RCTs or quasi-experiments 
were excluded, including case reports, case series, cross-
sectional surveys, and other qualitative studies. Adoles-
cents-focused studies were excluded, because they focused 
generally on social support and social norms and peers may 
not have self-identified as having substance use problems. 
Cost-effectiveness studies were excluded. Article types such 
as books, editorials, guidelines, commentaries, dissertations, 
discussions, policy analyses, and newspaper or magazine 
articles were excluded. Of the 488 records that underwent 
review to meet the authors’ inclusion/exclusion criteria noted 
earlier, 16 articles met the initial eligibility.
Final selection
Of the 16 records, ten articles were selected to be included in 
the article. Of the six excluded, three studies had a primary 
focus of peer support groups to train the peer support staff, 
two studies did not have consistent or adequately structured 
peer support groups in the design, and one study’s substance 
use inclusion criteria were too minimal.
Results
The literature search revealed articles that support the use 
of peer support services that include peer support groups 
within addiction treatment to address: 1) substance use, 2) 
treatment engagement, 3) HIV/HCV risk behaviors, and 4) 
secondary substance-related behaviors. It should be noted, 
however, that data were limited in finding peer support groups 
that were a standalone treatment as these groups were largely 
incorporated into a full array of peer support services being 
delivered, thereby posing challenges in disentangling the 
effects. Table 2 provides summaries of each study selected.
Substance use
Armitage et al67 discussed and evaluated Recovery Associa-
tion Project’
s (RAP) Recovery Community Services Program, 
a funded peer recovery service from 2003 to 2007. Recovery 
Community Services Program provided a wide range of peer 
recovery services, which included numerous self-help meet-
ings at the RAP center that became a popular location for 
self-help meetings (eg, AA, Narcotics Anonymous, Cocaine 
Anonymous, and Smart Recovery) with several scheduled 
meetings daily. The outcomes measured were substance use, 
consumer satisfaction, and progress toward RAP’s goals. 
RAP received participant feedback from the Government 
Performance Reporting Act survey and a satisfaction ques-
tionnaire. There were 152 survey participants included in 
this outcome evaluation. At 6-month follow-up, most (86%) 
participants receiving RAP services indicated on the Gov-
ernment Performance Reporting Act survey abstinence from 
using alcohol or drugs in the past 30 days, which is much 
higher than typically noted abstinence levels in this popula-
tion. These results help to demonstrate that RAP services are 
associated with sustained recovery from substance use. Data 
from the satisfaction questions administered at 6 months were 
also high, indicating RAP’s services are effectively meeting 
the needs of participants.
Boisvert et al70 established and evaluated the effective-
ness of a peer support community program. The primary 
purpose was to determine whether rates of relapse would 
decrease among addicts in recovery living in permanent 
supportive housing and increase their perceptions of com-
munity  
affiliation, supportive behaviors, self-determination 
(ie, proactive steps self-initiated to recovery), and quality 
of life. The peer support program was implemented by an 
occupational therapist and addiction professional following

facilitated the first 10 weeks and then withdrew to a support-
ive background as the community became self-facilitating. 
Meetings involved discussions on principles of a peer support 
recovery or peer-driven community between the therapist and 
residents. Documents such as handouts and readings were 
provided to the community members who had interest in 
being a leader within the community, and supportive meetings 
were scheduled. The peer support group focused on training 
in leadership, group communication, and group facilitation 
with community-elected officers and conducted biweekly 
meetings and social events, all being organized by members.
Using previous year relapse data to provide a comparison 
rate, Boisvert et al70 found significant reductions in relapse 
rates among participants in the peer support community pro-
grams. In addition, return to homelessness was dramatically 
reduced by assisting participants in managing their recov-
ery. These results imply that peer and community support 
groups are important in the process of relapse reduction, in 
particular, groups that focus on self-determination, as it can 
have a positive impact on recovery from substance abuse and 
homelessness. As for the main objectives, quantitative findings 
showed that three subscales (ie, emotional support, tangible 
support, and affectionate support) on the  
Medical Outcomes 
Study–Social Support Survey demonstrated significant differ-
ences, although there were no significant differences regarding 
quality of life from the Quality of Life Rating.70 In addition, 
qualitative findings showed that residents’ perceptions of 
community affiliation and supportive behaviors improved.
Another study conducted by Tracy et al21 investigated a 
new intervention, mentorship for alcohol problems (MAPs), 
that included peer support groups and one-to-one mentor-
ship services for individuals with alcohol-use disorders in 
community-treatment programs. Mentors participated for 
6 months until multiple mentees received MAP for 12 weeks. 
Behavioral and biological measures were conducted in addi-
tion to fidelity measures. Feasibility and acceptance data in 
the domains of patient interest, safety, and satisfaction were 
promising. In addition, mentees significantly reduced their 
alcohol and drug use from baseline to termination and the 
majority of mentors sustained abstinence. Fidelity measures 
indicated that mentors adhered to the delivery of treatment.
Velasquez et al71 evaluated the efficacy of a theory-based 
behavioral intervention that included both individual coun-
seling and peer group education/support to reduce alcohol 
use among HIV-positive men who have sex with men when 
compared to a control condition where participants received 
resource materials. Reported treatment effects occurred in 
reduction in the number of drinks per 30-day period and 
number of days drank heavily per 30-day period.
Engagement to treatment
Beyond associated reductions in alcohol and drug use, 
services that have included peer support groups have been 
utilized to engage substance-using populations in treat-
ment. Often high recidivism substance-using patients have 
 
difficulty connecting to outpatient treatment, contributing to 
greater functioning disturbances.72 Approaches to address this 
problem frequently are staff extensive. Tracy et al72 evaluated

the impact of peer mentorship, which included, in addition 
to other peer support services, peer support groups and/or 
enhanced dual recovery treatment (DRT) on individuals who 
were inpatients, substance abusing, and had a history of high 
recidivism. The primary outcome was post-discharge treat-
ment attendance. Within an inpatient Veterans Administration 
hospital setting, 96 patients with a history of high recidivism 
and current and/or past diagnosis of substance use disorders 
were randomized to either: 1) treatment as usual (TAU), 2) 
TAU + DRT + mentorship for addiction problems to enhance 
engagement to treatment (MAP-engage), or 3) TAU + MAP-
engage. The investigators found that overall MAP-engage 
was comparable to the DRT + MAP-engage, and both of 
these conditions were significantly better than TAU alone at 
increasing adherence to post-discharge substance abuse, and 
medical and mental health outpatient appointments with par-
ticipants in MAP-engage being three times as likely to attend 
their outpatient substance abuse treatment appointments 
than those in TAU 1 year post discharge. MAP-engage that 
included peer support groups offered an alternative approach 
to address lack of attendance to outpatient treatment appoint-
ments post discharge that is relatively low in staff reliance.
Similarly, in a large study, Mangrum68  compared access to 
recovery + substance use treatment to substance use treatment 
alone for consumers involved in the criminal justice system 
who had substance use disorders and were referred from drug 
courts, probation, or child protective services. Individuals 
who completed the program were significantly more likely to 
have received recovery support groups. However, it should be 
noted that only a relatively small portion of the sample within 
the completers group, 12%, utilized the support groups as 
there were multiple treatment options, but this was still over 
twice as much as in the non-completers group, 5%.
HIV/HCV risk behavior
Intervention for Seropositive Injectors–Research and Evalu-
ation study, an RCT of a peer support intervention designed 
to assess the reduction in sexual and injecting-related risk 
behaviors, increased use of HIV care, and increased HIV 
medication adherence as primary outcomes, was discussed 
by Purcell et al.73 The peer support intervention was ten 
sessions over a 12-month time period, with seven sessions 
being specifically devoted to peer support groups. The control 
condition was eight sessions of a video intervention. One out 
of the ten sessions was a peer volunteer activity during which 
participants went to a local service organization for 2–4 hours 
to observe, participate, and practice peer support skills. The 
topics from the group sessions included setting group rules 
and the power of peer mentoring, utilization of HIV primary 
care and adherence, and sex and drug risk behaviors.
Of the participants randomized, 486 were assigned to the 
peer support condition and 480 were assigned to the video 
discussion condition, totaling a sample of 966 HIV injection 
drug users (IDUs). Purcell et al73 found that randomized par-
ticipants in both conditions had retention rates of 87%, 83%, 
and 85% at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months, respectively. 
Significant reductions were noted in both groups for reduc-
tions from baseline in injection and sexual transmission risk 
behaviors, but there were no significant differences between 
conditions. Participants in both conditions reported no change 
in medical care and adherence.73
An RCT with a time-equivalent attention-control group 
was conducted by Latka et al74 among 418 HCV IDUs to 
examine a peer-mentoring behavioral intervention to reduce 
the distribution of injection practices and equipment among 
HCV IDUs. Each intervention consisted of six sessions, 
2 hours each twice a week. For the peer-mentoring group 
intervention, participants received information regarding 
HCV and learned risk reduction skills. By the fifth session, 
training participants were involved in outreach and delivered 
information about reducing HCV transmission risk. The 
control group watched a docudrama TV series about IDUs 
and participated in a facilitated group discussion focusing 
on family, education, self-respect, relationships, violence, 
parenting, and employment. Compared to the control group, 
participants in the peer support condition had significantly 
greater reductions in injection practices that could transmit 
HCV to other IDUs. Self-efficacy was significantly increased 
in the experimental condition, and post-intervention self-
efficacy was a positive mediator between the intervention 
and distributive risk behaviors.
In the study previously discussed in the substance use 
section, Velasquez et al71 also found a reduction in the number 
of days on which both heavy drinking and unprotected sex 
occurred among HIV-positive men who have sex with men.
Secondary substance-related outcomes
Craving has been associated with use of substances.75–78 The 
authors’ search also revealed a recently published pilot study 
that evaluated a peer support program for formerly incarcer-
ated adults who transitioned back into the community that 
included investigations of craving among other varriables.79 
This population experiences high rates of substance use. One 
of the main objectives of this study was to assess program 
feasibility using a community-based participatory research 
approach. Participants were 20 men on parole who were

Benefits of peer support groups in the treatment of addiction
released from prison within the past 30 days, with only 13 
completing the 60-day peer mentor intervention. Marlow 
et al78 measured 12-step meeting participation using a 13-item 
questionnaire that assessed participation in 12-step programs, 
belief in the 12-step framework, and investigated relation-
ships with craving and negative affect. Questions assessing 
belief in 12-step framework included: I am powerless over my 
drug and alcohol problem, I believe a higher power plays a 
role in my recovery, I am not alone with my drug and alcohol 
problem, I believe in the 12-step faith and spirituality, and I 
am member of 12-step. Twelve-step meetings were attended 
by participants on an average of 17 days out of 30 days and 
participants contacted their sponsor on average ten times. 
All participants’ belief in the 12-step framework was high. 
Pre- and posttest results on two abstinence subscales, negative 
affect and habitual craving, showed significant improvement, 
indicating an improved confidence level in the ability to 
abstain from substance use.
Andreas et al69 sought to examine Peers Reach Out 
Supporting Peers to Embrace Recovery (PROSPER), a 
peer-driven recovery community that provides a number of 
peer-driven supports for members to be able to recover from 
drug use and criminality as they transition back into the com-
munity and to provide support to their family members and 
loved ones. PROSPER provided a strategic mix of services, 
all planned, implemented, and delivered by peers including 
peer-run groups and group activities that take place in a 
light-hearted social environment away from traditional treat-
ment settings. The aims of the program were to: 1) provide 
peer support environment, 2) build positive self-concept and 
achievement motivation, 3) reinforce family/significant oth-
ers’ relationships and support, and 4) amplify the treatment 
continuum.77 The study outcome measures were self-efficacy, 
perceived social support, personal feeling, perceived stress, 
and quality of life. Program effects were evaluated and dem-
onstrated at 12  months from baseline with significant and 
positive changes in participants’ self-efficacy, social support 
perceptions, quality of life, and feelings of guilt and shame 
over a 12-month period. The result of this study suggests the 
importance of peer support among people who are reentering 
the community, which can promote positive outcomes such 
as reduced substance use and recidivism.
Discussion
Despite the recent surge in the adoption of peer support 
services within addiction treatment systems, there are rela-
tively limited data rigorously evaluating outcomes.21 These 
data become even more limited when considering one form 
of peer support services, such as peer support groups as in 
the case of this review, due to the nature of peer support 
services being delivered often in a multitude of combined 
modalities. Thus, we included studies of peer support groups 
that were delivered often in an array of other peer support 
treatments, which diminished our ability to disentangle the 
results. However, this review still provides a useful platform 
to begin to explore the inclusion of these peer support groups 
as a component of other peer services and associated benefits 
thus far to guide the field in the future researching of this area.
Although methodological limitations existed in studies 
that resulted from previous existing systematic reviews of 
peer support services, beneficial effects were noted.65,66 
This article builds upon these reviews by the specificity on 
peer support groups, which is a common platform in treat-
ment. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first article to 
date to take such an approach reviewing controlled studies. 
The previous reviews examined a range of peer support 
services. Moreover, we expanded beyond existing reviews 
to include substance-related HIV/HCV risk behavior stud-
ies due to the high prevalence of substance use disorders 
in this population. Drug abuse is inextricably linked with 
HIV due to heightened risk both of contracting HIV and of 
worsening its consequences, and HCV is one of the most 
common viral hepatitis infections transmitted through 
drug-using high-risk behaviors, making reduction of risk 
behaviors one of the priorities in substance abuse treatment 
at the National Institute on Drug Abuse.80 Finally, we also 
expanded our review to include 12-step studies due to their 
focus on peer support groups and contributions to the peer 
support movement.
Our review revealed articles that demonstrated peer 
support services that include groups delivered to those with 
substance use problems showing associated benefits in the 
following areas: 1) substance use, 2) treatment engagement, 
3) HIV/HCV risk behaviors, and 4) secondary substance-
related behaviors such as craving and self-efficacy.
Those who participated in treatments, including peer sup-
port groups, showed higher rates of abstinence than common 
in substance-abusing populations while also being more satis-
fied with the treatment.67 Furthermore, significant reductions 
in relapse rates were shown in addition to significant reduc-
tions in return to homelessness in a challenging population 
to treat.70 Reported benefits extended beyond those being the 
recipient of the peer support groups to those also delivering 
the services, where significant reductions in alcohol and drug 
use were shown not only for mentees but also for sustained 
abstinence in the majority of mentors.21

Beyond substance use, peer support groups offer unique 
advantages to engaging our historically difficult-to-engage 
populations. Services that included peer support groups 
were found to be equally comparable to the additive of exten-
sive DRT, and both were significantly better than standard 
 
treatment at increasing adherence to post-discharge substance 
abuse and medical and mental health outpatient appointments 
for high recidivism individuals with substance use disorders.72 
Moreover, consumers involved in the criminal justice system 
who had substance use disorders and were referred from drug 
courts, probation, or child protective services, who completed 
the program, were significantly more likely to have received 
recovery support groups.68 However, it should be noted that 
only a relatively small sample completed, thus diminishing 
the impact of these results.
Peer support services that include groups have also been 
associated with reductions in HIV and HCV risk behaviors 
in IDUs. One study demonstrated a reduction in injection and 
sexually transmitted risk behaviors in both conditions, but 
there was no significant difference between the peer condition 
and the control condition, which was also an intervention.73 
However, another study showed not just a reduction but sig-
nificantly greater reductions in injection practices that could 
transmit HCV to other IDUs when comparing the peer sup-
port condition to the control group.74 Consistent with previous 
research, the study suggests that this enhanced behavioral 
intervention of education and counseling was associated with 
safer injection practices. Thus, providing implications that 
these components (ie, skill building and education) of peer 
mentoring provided to HCV-injecting drug users can lead 
to safer practices of injection drug use and may contribute 
to reducing the risk in IDUs and the transmission of HCV to 
other IDUs. Another study demonstrated significant reduc-
tions not only in risk behaviors but also in heavy drinking 
while accomplishing this.71
One of the key elements that peer support services sig-
nificantly positively impact is improvement in participants’ 
self-efficacy, which was also found to be a positive media-
tor between interventions and distributive risk behaviors 
in one study.69 Associated positive changes have also been 
demonstrated such as improvements in negative affect, social 
support perceptions, reductions in habitual craving, and feel-
ings of guilt or shame.69,79 All of these areas play important 
roles in one’s ability to achieve and sustain abstinence from 
substances. There were conflicting results from studies on 
whether or not quality-of-life improvements were associ-
ated with peer support groups being included in services.69,70
Peer support groups included in addiction treatment show 
much promise in potentially reducing substance use, improv-
ing engagement, reducing HIV/HCV risk behaviors, and 
improving substance-related outcomes. However, even given 
their widespread use, there are relatively limited empirical 
data relevant to this topic, which may diminish the ability 
to draw definitive conclusions, with resulting studies being 
ten. Although this is similar in number to other reviews in 
related peer support topics, it is relatively low. We included 
only US studies due to not having access to other non-English 
search engines in addition to ruling out language barriers, 
but this also limits the data. Finally, some investigators note 
that  
self-selection into peer support groups and residential 
recovery homes is important in the process in treatment,33,81 
which then may confound outcomes and limit generalizabil-
ity in RCTs for those select participants who may be solely 
interested in gains outside of participation such as partici-
pant payment. More rigorous research is needed, including 
meta-analytic studies as more data surface in this area, to 
substantiate the results of the studies included in this review 
and further expand on this important line of research.
