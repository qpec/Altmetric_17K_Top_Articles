ABSTRACT
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) represents a major unmet clinical need arising from
the progressive weakness and atrophy of skeletal muscles. The dearth of adequate experimental
models has severely hampered our understanding of the disease. To date, no treatment is available
for FSHD. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) potentially represent a renewable source of skeletal
muscle cells (SkMCs) and provide an alternative to invasive patient biopsies. We developed a scalable
monolayer system to differentiate hESCs into mature SkMCs within 26 days, without cell sorting or
genetic manipulation. Here we show that SkMCs derived from FSHD1-affected hESC lines exclusively
express the FSHD pathogenic marker double homeobox 4 and exhibit some of the defects reported in
FSHD. FSHD1 myotubes are thinner when compared with unaffected and Becker muscular dystrophy
myotubes, and differentially regulate genes involved in cell cycle control, oxidative stress response,
andcelladhesion.ThiscellularmodelwillbeapowerfultoolforstudyingFSHDandwillultimatelyassistin

SIGNIFICANCE
This work describes an efficient and highly scalable monolayer system to differentiate human plurip-
otent stem cells (hPSCs) into skeletal muscle cells (SkMCs) and demonstrates disease-specific pheno-
types in SkMCs derived from both embryonic and induced hPSCs affected with facioscapulohumeral
musculardystrophy.Thisstudyrepresentsthefirsthuman stem cell-basedcellular model foramuscular
dystrophy that is suitable for high-throughput screening and drug development.
INTRODUCTION
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)
isoneofthemostcommonanddevastating forms
ofmusculardystrophy, affecting1in8,000people
[1]. The pathology is initially and often asymmet-
rically limited to a small set of skeletal muscles
and is characterized by progressive weakness
and atrophy of facial, shoulder, and upper arm
muscles, eventually affecting the trunk and lower
extremities [2, 3].
FSHD is caused by complex genetic and epige-
netic defects [2, 4]. In the vast majority of cases
(95%), referred to as FSHD1, the disease is associ-
ated with an autosomal dominant contraction of
the D4Z4 repeat array in the 4q35 subtelomeric
region. In nonaffected individuals, this array com-
prises 11–100 tandem copies of the 3.3-kb D4Z4
element, whereas patients with FSHD1 only have
1–10 D4Z4 copies. However, in approximately 5%
of patients, termed FSHD2, the contraction of the
D4Z4arrayisnotobserved.AlthoughFSHD1and2
appear to be clinically indistinguishable, FSHD2
patientsaregeneticallydistinct,withamorecom-
plex digenic inheritance pattern [5]. The D4Z4
contraction is thought to alter chromatin struc-
ture and subsequently lead to the aberrant de-
repression of several 4q35 genes, among which
the retrogene double homeobox 4 (DUX4) is be-
lieved to be the main pathogenic candidate [6–8].
Althoughkeyprogressinunderstandingthedisease
has been made in the last decade and a generally
accepted model has emerged [9], the molecular
mechanisms underlying FSHD are not fully under-
stood and often debated. To date, no treatment
is available specifically for FSHD.
One of the most challenging aspects of studying
FSHD and a major limitation in drug development

PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS
 is the ability to model the disease in cultured cells or animal mod-
els.BecauseonlyprimateshavetheretrogeneDUX4embeddedin
the D4Z4 region, the generation of animal models that recapitu-
late the disease has proven difficult. Several approaches have
been developed to establish FSHD mouse models, mostly based
on overexpression of FSHD candidate genes [10–13]. Although
thesemiceexhibitsomeaspectsofFSHD,noneofthemaccurately
portrays the human condition [14]. Primary myoblasts from hu-
man biopsies and ectopic DUX4 expression in mouse myogenic
cells have served as cellular models for FSHD [15–18]. Although
these cells have been useful for demonstrating the regulation
of DUX4 and its implication in FSHD, such models are not suitable
for intensive studies or high-throughput screening required for
drug development. Genetically affected human embryonic stem
cells (hESCs) offer a major advantage for modeling human muscu-
lar diseases. In addition to their unmodified genome, hESCs have
proliferationanddifferentiationpropertiesthatmakethemanex-
cellent source of skeletal muscle cells (SkMCs). Furthermore,
hESCs provide the opportunity to investigate the early stages of
pathogenesis and allow the identification of primary causes of
genetic disease rather than downstream physiological effects.
Until very recently, SkMC derivation from hESCs remained a chal-
lenge and often required the forced expression of myogenic fac-
tors [19–21], the generation of three-dimensional (3D) embryoid
bodies/spheres [22–24], or extensive cell sorting [25]—three
techniques limiting the quantity or consistency of SkMCs pro-
duced and their applications such as drug screening [26]. Differ-
entiation methodologies have subsequently improved, and
recent protocols were derived by recapitulating skeletal muscle
embryonic development using small molecules [27–29]. Gener-
ally, previously published protocols necessitate a prolonged
time in culture and generate SkMCs with variable efficiency.
We have developed a monolayer protocol for the differenti-
ation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into 70% skeletal
myosin heavy chain (SkMHC)-positive skeletal muscle cells within
26 days without cell sorting or genetic manipulation. In this study,
we generated mature SkMCs from three FSHD1-affected hESC
lines and compared them to three unaffected hESC lines for their
capacitytodifferentiateandcellularphenotype.OneBeckermus-
cular dystrophy (BMD)-affected hESC line was used as a disease
control. We demonstrated FSHD-specific changes in FSHD1-
affected hESC-SkMCs, including DUX4 expression, thinner myo-
tubes, and genetic dysregulation. We confirmed FSHD1-specific
phenotypes in SkMCs derived from two FSHD1-affected induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. This study reveals a novel and
renewable method for the study of muscular diseases and un-
coversphenotypes ofFSHD1-affectedmyotubessuitableforther-
apeutic screening applications.

and skMHC (1/200; DSHBA4.1025).In order to validate our anal-
ysis method, two myosin heavy chain (MHC) antibodies were
used to ensure that similar results were obtained from the im-
age analysis based on either stain. Ki67 antibody (1/400; D3B5,
Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, http://www.cellsignal.com) was
used to detect proliferating cells. For pluripotency markers,
Oct4 (1/200; BD Biosciences, catalog no. 560217), TRA-1-60
(1/150; BD Bioscience, catalog no. 560121), and Nanog (1/150;
BD Biosciences, catalog no. 560483) antibodies were used. Ap-
propriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Life Sciences; 1:500) were used, and nuclei were visu-
alized with Hoechst 33342 (1/5,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific
Life Sciences catalog no. H3570). For reactive oxygen species
(ROS) detection, CellROX Oxidative Stress Reagents (Thermo

Cells were incubated for 30 minutes with CellROX Green Re-
agent, a probe that upon oxidation binds to DNA and exhibits
fluorogenic signal in the nucleus and mitochondria of live cells.
For 5-ethynyl-29-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, cells were treated
with 1:1,000 EdU (10 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide) in differenti-
ation medium for 1 hour at37°C.Cells werefixed with 10% formalin
and then treated with Click-iT Plus EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences catalog no. 10640) as per
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were imaged by using an

Myotube Morphology Analysis
Myotubes were stained by immunofluorescence with MF20 anti-
body as described above. Cells were imaged with the IN Cell An-
alyzer 6000, and myotube morphology was analyzed with
Developer Toolbox Version 1.9. Briefly, myotubes were identified
by drawing a circular mask determined by MF20 staining that
could be analyzed to define the fiber length and the average,
median, and maximal diameters. For the number of nuclei per
myotube, nuclei were identified by drawing a circular mask deter-
mined by Hoechst staining. Developer Toolbox Version 1.9 soft-
ware was used to define when an identified nucleus was present
within a MF20 stained cell. Myotubes were counted from at least
12 random fields in three independent experiments, and the data
were collated. The results are expressed as mean values 6 99%
confidence. Myotubes with a width ,5 mm were considered “thin
myotubes.” The ratio of thin versus total myotubes is expressed in
percent as mean 6 SEM.
siRNA Transfections
DUX4 siRNA (siDUX4: 59-r[GAUGAUUAGUUCAGAGA UA]d[TT]-39)
used in this study were custom synthesized (Silencer Select,
Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences) by using previously pub-
lished sequences [16]. For a nontargeting control, we used the
nontargeting Silencer Select Negative Control 1 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Life Sciences). For 1 well of a 12-well plate, 2 ml of
10 mM stock was resuspended in 100 ml of Opti-Mem (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Life Sciences) and incubated for 5 min with
3 ml of Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sci-
ences). The same conditions were scaled down for transfection in
96-well plates. The mixture was added to myoblasts at day 18,
when the cells were switched to myotube medium version 1.0
for terminal differentiation. Medium was changed every 2 days,
and 7 days later, RNA was harvested to assess DUX4 expression
by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and myotubes
were fixed with formalin to assess their morphology.
Total RNA Extraction and Quantitative Reverse-
Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis
TotalRNAwasharvestedfrommyotubeculturesbyusingtheAxy-
prep Multisource total RNA kit (Corning, Corning, NY, http://
www.corning.com). Quality and quantity of RNA were assessed
by absorbance spectroscopy (Nanodrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Life Sciences). For DUX4 quantitative reverse-transcription poly-
merase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), RNA was treated with DNase in
solution using Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sci-
ences). After quantification, 1 mg of RNA was retrotranscribed
with Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences). A total of 2 ml of cDNA
was used for qPCR using the SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix Uni-
versal kit. Real-Time PCR was run on a CFX96 Bio-Rad Real-Time
PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, http://www.bio-
rad.com). Details of the reactions, cycle program, and primer se-
quences are described in the supplemental online data.
Whole Transcriptome Gene Expression Analysis
TotalRNAsamples werecollected fromthree biologicalreplicates
of unaffected-, FSHD1-, and BMD-hESC-derived myotubes as de-
scribed above. The total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA
and in vitro-transcribed to biotin-labeled cRNA by using the Illu-
mina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Ambion, Thermo Fisher
Scientific Life Sciences). The cRNA was hybridized to Illumina
HumanHT-12v4 Expression BeadChiptranscriptome-wide arrays.
Probe intensities were background subtracted by using Beadstu-
dio (Illumina, San Diego, CA, http://www.illumina.com) and nor-
malized by using the cross-correlation method [31] on MATLAB.
Gene probe sets with minimum 1.5-fold change (on a log 2 scale)
and t test significance p , .05 on the average of FSHD1 or BMD
samples over the average of the unaffected controls were iso-
lated. Heatmaps of normalized fold change in gene expression
on a log 2 scale were generated by using Cluster and Treeview
[32], and while diagrams were produced by using Venny (http://
bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html). Gene ontology was
performed by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany, http://www.qiagen.com), and significant disease func-
tions were identified with p , .05 by using Fisher’s exact test. The
microarray data were deposited into the National Center for Bio-
technology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database with accession no. GSE64003. For comparison against
other FSHD1 datasets, raw RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data were
obtained for FSHD1/control biopsies and myotube samples from
the NCBI GEO dataset GSE56787 [6], and sequence counts were
normalized by using the total numbers of mappable reads across
all samples. Affymetrix microarray data analysis [33] was con-
ducted on of FSHD1/control myotube samples from the dataset
GSE26145 and normalized by using the Cross-Correlation method

tween the average of the FSHD1 versus control samples in the
RNA-Seq and/or Affymetrix datasets in agreement with the Illu-

RESULTS
Efficient Generation of Mature Skeletal Muscle Cells
From hESCs
The generation of SkMCs from hPSCs in high yields and within a
reasonable time frame has been challenging. In order to develop
an efficient protocol for the differentiation of hPSCs into SkMCs,
we used high-throughput screening and tested combinations of
small molecules and growth factors for their potential to initiate
and promote myogenic differentiation. To demonstrate the effi-
ciency of our newly established monolayer system, three hESC
lines were initially tested. The workflow of skeletal muscle differ-
entiation highlighting the key factors used is shown in Figure 1A.
The detailed protocol is described in Materials and Methods.
Briefly, hESCs (GENEA002, GENEA019, and GENEA020) were
plated at low density and with no cell-cell contact onto collagen
I-coatedplates,andtheywereexposedtoaseriesofskeletalmus-
cle media following a three-step process. To confirm their muscle
identity, differentiating cells were stained with stage-specific
muscle markers at the three steps of the differentiation process.
ResultsfromthebestexperimentsarepresentedinFigure1.After
10 days in skeletal muscle induction medium, immunofluores-
cence experiments with myogenic progenitor markers revealed
that 80% of the cells were PAX3+, 20% were PAX7+, and
30%–40% were CD56+, indicating muscle lineage commitment
(Fig. 1B, 1E). At day 18, after the second step of differentiation,
50%–60% of the cells stained positive for MYOD1, a key regulator
of myogenesis, and 20% were Desmin+ (DES; muscle-specific in-
termediate filament), showing that the myogenic precursors de-
veloped into skeletal myoblasts (Fig. 1C, 1F). At day 26, after the
third and final stage of the process, the cells differentiated fur-
ther, and 50%–80% formed elongated and multinucleated myo-
tubes that stained positive for the skeletal muscle markers
myogenin, MF20 (sarcomeric myosin), dystrophin, and a-Actinin
(Fig. 1D, 1G). Time-lapse recording showed hESC myoblast prolif-
eration and differentiation into myotubes (supplemental online
Movie 1). Mature myotubes were generated reproducibly and
consistently from 20 different hESC lines, indicating that this
method of SkMC derivation is fast, efficient, and robust. In fact,
all cell lines (hESC and human induced pluripotent stem cell
[hiPSC]) tested by us as well as collaborators (C.P. Emerson, Jr.,
personal communication) could be efficiently differentiated by
thismethod.Anotherkeyadvantageisthe highyieldofSkMCpro-
duction. On average, from 13 experiments across 10 lines, 1 hESC
resulted in approximately 2,000 myoblasts at day 18. During the
fusion process, increased cell death was observed, and approxi-
mately 70% of the final population formed myotubes. This
translates to 1,000–1,200 mature SkMCs arising from 1 hESC.
Furthermore, cells can be passaged at the myogenic progenitor
or myoblast stages, which could increase the number of myo-
tubes generated from each hESC. However, the number of
passages is limited, or cells stop proliferating. Myogenic pro-
genitors and myoblasts can be banked, and this does not affect
their differentiation capacities. HESC myotubes were also ma-
ture and functional. Twitching fibers could be observed in cul-
ture and are shown in supplemental online Movie 2.
Derivation of FSHD1 and BMD Affected hESC Lines
In order to develop a cellular model for FSHD, three FSHD1-
affected hESC lines, (siblings GENEA049 and 050 and GENEA096)
were derived from independent embryos after preimplantation
genetic diagnosis. These lines carry the deletion responsible for
FSHD and contain a D4Z4 array size of 22.6 kb (GENEA049 and
GENEA050) and 24 kb (GENEA096), corresponding to 5 and 6 cop-
ies of the D4Z4 unit, respectively. The size of the D4Z4 repeats
remained stable during culture (data not shown). In addition,
we derived one hESC line affected by BMD that was used as a dis-
ease control. Three nonaffected hESC lines were also used as con-
trols (GENEA002, GENEA015, and GENEA019). There is no familial
relationship between the control and diseased lines. Their details
are shown in supplemental online Table 1.
FSHD1-hESCs Efficiently Differentiate Into Skeletal
Muscle Cells
ToassesswhetherFSHD1orBMDmutationsaffectthegeneration
of SkMCs, we tested the ability of three independent FSHD1 hESC
lines to differentiate into mature SkMCs and compared the out-
comestounaffectedandoneBMD-affectedcontrollines.After10
days in induction medium, no significant difference in PAX3 or
PAX7 expression was observed between unaffected and FSHD1
myogenic precursor (Fig. 2A). However, a consistent 40% de-
crease in the number of myoblasts expressing MYOD1 was ob-
served in FSHD myoblasts at day 18 of the differentiation (Fig.
2B). This suggests that DUX4 expression repressed MYOD1 ex-
pression in the early stage of skeletal muscle differentiation
and is in agreement with numerous studies [15, 34, 35]. However,
inourmodel,thisdoesnot affectthecapacityofFSHD1myoblasts
to differentiate. After 26 days of in vitro differentiation, FSHD1-
hESCs formed a well-organized network of multinucleated
myotubes staining positive for MF20, dystrophin, and SkMHC
(50%–70%), similarly to unaffected control cells (Fig. 2C–2F).
Identical to the unaffected SkMCs, 40% of the nuclei within
FSHD1 myotubes expressed myogenin (Fig. 2C–2F). Interest-
ingly, BMD-affected hESCs showed impaired skeletal muscle
differentiation, with only 30% of MF20- and SkMHC-expressing
myotubes (Fig. 2D, 2E). As expected, only a small number (15%)
of BMD-affected myotubes stained positive for dystrophin (Fig.
2D, 2E), consistent with the BMD-associated mutation/deletion in
the dystrophin gene, causing a reduced expression of the protein
[36]. These results demonstrate that FSHD1 hESCs can differentiate
into skeletal muscle cells with the same efficiency as unaffected
cell lines. Unlike a previous report on myotubes derived from pri-
maryFSHD1myoblasts[37],weneverobservedadisorganizedmyo-
tube morphology from FSHD1- hESC lines.

 Despite variability between cell lines, FSHD1-affected and un-
affected lines did not show significant differences in patterns of
proliferation, as demonstrated by the resulting cell numbersafter
each proliferative stage, in myogenic progenitors and myoblasts
(supplemental online Fig. 2A). Cell-cycle kinetics were also
analyzed by immunostaining against the proliferation-specific
proteins Ki67 in day 10 (d10) myogenic precursors and d18
myoblasts. The vast majority of healthy and FSHD1-affected cells
(90%) were positive for Ki67 and therefore actively proliferating
at both stages (supplemental online Fig. 2B).
hESC-SkMCs Show Characteristics of Functional Fetal
Skeletal Muscle Cells
To further validate our differentiation protocol and assess the ex-
pression profile of a larger panel of skeletal muscle markers, we
performed DNA microarray analysis on undifferentiated hESCs
and myotubes derived from the seven hESC lines, using Illumina
HumanHT-12v4 arrays. Normalized microarray expression data
are shown in Figure 2G and supplemental online Figure 1. All
affected and unaffected hESC-SkMCs expressed high and com-
parable levels of skeletal muscle-specific genes, including
the myogenesis differentiation factor myogenin (supplemental
online Fig. 1), the skeletal muscle contractility genes (Fig. 2G), NEB
(nebulin),TTNN2A(titin),TNNT(TroponinT),TNNI(troponinI),TNNC
(troponinC), MYOM1 (myomesin; supplemental online Fig. 1), and
the skeletal muscle-specific enzyme CKM (muscle specific creatine
kinase; supplemental online Fig. 1). In accordance with our dy-
strophin immunofluorescence data (Fig. 2D, 2E), the microarray
confirmed reduced expression of dystrophin in BMD myotubes
(supplemental online Fig. 1). The presence of both fast-twitch
(TNNI2, TNNT3, and TNNC2) and slow-twitch (TNNC1 and TNNT1)
fiber-specific genes was also detected (Fig. 2C and supplemental
online Fig. 1). MYH3 and MYH8 (myosin heavy chain isoforms),
which are typical of fetal development and muscle regeneration,
were highly expressed in all hESC-SkMC samples (supplemental
online Fig. 1), suggesting that, in our system, hESCs generate early
stage fetal-like muscle cells. As expected, TTN N2B (a cardiac-
specific isoform of TTN) was not expressed in our skeletal muscle
cells (data not shown), demonstrating the specificity of our system.
To ensure that no residual pluripotent cells remained in culture
upon differentiation, we analyzed the expression of pluripotency
markersNanog,Oct4,andTRA-1-60byimmunofluorescenceinhESC
myoblasts, at d17 of the differentiation process before fusion into
myotubes.Although thethreemarkers were presentin thevast ma-
jority of pluripotent hESCs, they were not detected in differentiating
myoblasts from healthy and FSHD1 cell lines (supplemental online
Fig. 3A). This was further confirmed by the microarray data in hESC
myotubes. Pluripotency markers Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 were
highly expressed in all undifferentiated hESCs and completely
downregulated in hESC-SkMC cultures, regardless of disease sta-
tus (supplemental online Fig. 3B).
FSHD Myotubes Are Thinner and Shorter Than Controls
The morphology of both FSHD and unaffected myotubes dis-
played a broad range of lengths and diameters, and no obvious
defects were initially observed in FSHD1 myotubes. Because
several studies reported reduced diameters in FSHD muscle
cells [37–39], we performed a detailed morphological analysis of
hESC-SkMCs. Myotubes were stained with a MF20-specific anti-
body, and the width, length, and number of nuclei per myotube
were analyzed by using automated high-content analysis technol-
ogy. To prevent bias from any one particular experiment, we show
here the mean value of the pooled data from three independent
experiments.Highlyconsistentresultsfromindividualexperiments
are also presented in supplemental online Fig. 4. FSHD1 myotubes
were generally thinner than the control and BMD-affected lines,
with an average and median diameter of 5.5–5.8 and 5.2–5.4 mm,
respectively, versus 6–6.2 and 5.6–5.8 mm for control myotubes
(Fig. 3A, 3B). The maximal diameter showed a greater difference,
with 10.8–12.7 mm for FSHD myotubes and 13.3–13.4 mm
for control myotubes (Fig. 3C). To quantify the reduced thickness
in our FSHD-SkMCs, we counted the number of myotubes with an
average diameter of ,5 mm that we defined as thin myotubes.
Reanalysis of our data with this diameter threshold showed that
12%–23%of the FSHDmyotubes werethinas compared with only
5%–8% in unaffected and 3% in BMD-affected SkMC cultures (Fig.
3D). Like BMD myotubes (324 mm), FSHD myotubes were shorter
(183–377 mm) than unaffected controls (438–536 mm) (Fig. 3E).
Counting the number of nuclei per myotube also showed that FSHD
and BMD myotubes contained a lower number of nuclei (Fig. 3F).
These data suggest thatour FSHD myotubes already demonstrate
cell-autonomous thin phenotypes at the fetal-like stage.
Microarray Analysis Demonstrates FSHD-Specific
Regulation of the D4Z4 Locus
Many expression arrays and some protein expression studies
have been performed on control and FSHD muscle biopsies,
but a strong molecular signature for FSHD remains to be deter-
mined[33,40–42].Inordertoidentifygenesand/orpathwaysdif-

 hESC lines. By using the criteria described in Materials and Meth-
ods (minimum 1.5-fold change and statistically significant at
p , .05), a total of 746 genes were dysregulated in FSHD myo-
tubes, representing 1.6% of the transcripts arrayed. As shown
on the Venn diagram and the heatmap (supplemental online
Fig. 5A, 5B), the majority of genes with altered expression in FSHD
are not dysregulated in BMD. We observed 215 upregulated
probes and 531 downregulated probes specifically in FSHD. We
saw very little evidence (less than 10 genes up and down) of over-
lapping patterns of altered expression between the two diseases.
Only 59 genes were coregulated and moving in the same direc-
tions in both FSHD1 and BMD, demonstrating that these two
muscle pathologies are fundamentally different. The full list of
FSHD-associated dysregulated genes is available in supplemental
online Table 2.
Several studies support the position-effect hypothesis in
FSHD, by claiming that several genes located close to the D4Z4 lo-
cus on 4q35 are upregulated in FSHD muscle [8, 10, 43]. In our
microarray study, we found that two of the genes in the 4q35 re-
gion, SLC25A4 (ANT1) and PDLIM3 (ALP), are significantly upregu-
lated in FSHD1 myotubes (Table 1). DUX4 mRNA expression was
not detected in any of the skeletal muscle samples (data not
shown). This may be because of its low level of expression below
the detection limit of the method [30]. However, the first identi-
fied DUX4 target, PITX1, was downregulated, as observed in one
type of muscle biopsy [44]. A summary of the changes in gene ex-
pression reported to be dysregulated in FSHD is shown in Table 2.
Dysregulation of the D4Z4 locus and its downstream targets is a
hallmark of FSHD and validates the use of our hESC-SkMC model
for the study of FSHD.
DUX4 Is Exclusively Expressed in FSHD1-Affected SkMCs
In healthy individuals, DUX4 expression is epigenetically sup-
pressed in differentiated tissues [30]. Although DUX4 mechanisms
of action and downstream targets are not entirely elucidated,
aberrant upregulation of DUX4 in muscle is believed to be the
main molecular signature of FSHD [6]. Detection of the DUX4
protein proved technically challenging because of its particularly
low abundance in only a very small number of nuclei in FSHD
myoblasts (1 in 1,000) and myotubes (1 in 200) [45]. We have
analyzed DUX4 expression by RT-qPCR at the different stages
of hESC differentiation into SkMCs (myogenic precursors, myo-
blasts, and myotubes). Results confirmed exclusive DUX4 ex-
pression in the three FSHD lines, with higher DUX4 expression
levels in myotubes than in myoblasts, consistent with a study
by Tassin et al. [45]. Interestingly, we also found a high level of
DUX4 expression in FSHD1 myogenic precursors (Fig. 3G). DUX4
qPCR product was sequenced to confirm that the correct DUX4
sequence was amplified (data not shown). We also analyzed
theexpression ofzinc fingerandSCANdomain-containing protein
4 (ZSCAN4) and methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3-like 2
(MBD3L2) in hESC myotubes, two previously identified DUX4
targets [6] that were not detected in our microarray because of
their low level of expression (Table 2). We confirmed the expres-
sion of ZSCAN4 and MBD3L2 exclusively in FSHD1-affected myo-
tubes (Fig. 3H). These findings are consistent with a recent study
showing that, although FSHD clinical manifestations are generally
not present until midlife, molecular markers of FSHD are already
expressed at the fetal stages [18]. These data further validate our
hESC-SkMC system as a cellular model for FSHD.
DUX4 Expression Is Responsible for the Thin Diameters
of FSHD1 Myotubes
To demonstrate that the morphological changes we observed in
FSHD1 myotubes are caused by DUX4 expression, we attempted
a rescue by DUX4 knockdown in FSHD1 myotubes. Myoblasts de-
rived from two FSHD-hESC lines (GENEA049 and GENEA050) and
two control lines (GENEA015 and GENEA019) were transfected
with DUX4 siRNA at d18 and further differentiated into myotubes
until d26. Although siRNA transfections did not affect skeletal
muscle differentiation of any cell lines (Fig. 3J), a clear reduction
of DUX4 transcript levels was observed in FSHD myotubes trans-
fectedwith siDUX4, but not with the scrambled control (Fig. 3I).
Interestingly, after differentiation, thin diameters observed in
FSHD myotubes were rescued in siDUX4-transfected cells (Fig.
3K), demonstrating a correlation between DUX4 expression
level and myotube diameter in the FSHD1 lines. In contrast,
we did not observe a rescue of the FSHD myotube length (data
not shown).
BiologicalPathwaysDisruptedinFSHD1-hESCMyotubes
To explore which biological pathways are disrupted in FSHD1, we
performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the genes that are
differentially expressed by more than 1.5-fold (p , .05) between
affected and unaffected myotubes. A summary of the most signif-
icantly altered biological functions and examples of dysregulated
genesarerepresentedinTable1.OftheFSHD-specificdysregulated
genes,manyplayacriticalroleincellcycle(Cdc42,CDKN1B,CDKN2B,
CDC8, and Cyclin D1) and cell proliferation/differentiation (MYOD1),
with only a small minority being implicated in myogenesis. As
shown in Table 1, the components of three canonical signaling
pathways involved in proliferation and/or differentiation of
many cell types (Notch1/Dll1, Wnt2/Wnt5A, and TGFb2/
BMP4) were also found to be dysregulated in FSHD1 muscles.
Several studies have demonstrated the hypersensitivity of
FSHD myoblasts to oxidative stress [38, 46]. Interestingly,
our microarray data showed that four genes involved in oxida-
tive stress response were dysregulated in FSHD myotubes. The
expression of the antioxidant enzymes CAT (catalase) and
GSTT1 (Glutathione S Transferase 1), which has been shown
to be upregulated by oxidative stress [47] and induced by
DUX4 expression [6], were found to be highly increased in FSHD
versus control myotubes. Finally, a large number of the signif-
icantly altered genes in FSHD muscle are components of the

volved in cell adhesion/migration. The list is summarized in
Table 1 and includes genes encoding for collagen, laminin
(LAMA2, LAMC3, and LAMB1), fibrinillin, and other ECM pro-
teins, integrins, and cadherins. Interestingly, gene pathways
involved in cell adhesion, cell migration, and ECM signaling
have recently been shown to be downregulated in DUX4-
expressing cells [48].
FSHD1-hESC Myotubes Have Common and Distinct
Gene Dysregulation Profiles With FSHD1-Muscle
Biopsy-Derived Myotubes
We compared the list of FSHD1-dysregulated genes identified in
our microarray study with those previously reported to be dysre-
gulated in FSHD1 biopsy-derived myotubes in the RNA-seq anal-
ysis performed by Yao et al. [6] and in the microarray analysis
from Tsumagari et al. [33]. The latter was chosen over other
FSHD1 microarray datasets because only isolated cells (myoblasts/
differentiated myotubes) were analyzed and are more reflective
of our cellular model than full skeletal muscle biopsies containing
amixtureofnonmusclecells.TheChelietal.microarraystudywas
omitted because the majority of FSHD1 dysregulated genes were
found to be in myoblasts and only a small number were in myo-
tubes [40]. Of the 746 FSHD1-dysregulated probes in our micro-
array data, 137 genes were also found to be dysregulated in
FSHD1-biopsy-derived myotubesfromthe Tsumagarietal.micro-
array and/or Yao et al. RNA-seq datasets (supplemental online
Fig. 6). Among them, GSTT1 is common to all three studies,

 indicating that it is a canonical target of FSHD1. PKP2 (Plakophilin 2),
encoding for a protein that links cadherins to intermediate fil-
aments in the cytoskeleton, is also common to all three studies
and could suggest a dysregulation of cell adhesion/migration in
FSHD1. In total, 85 genes identified in our microarray study were
in agreement with the FSHD1 myotube samples of Yao et al., in-
cluding 2 of the myogenesis factors (NFIX and MSTN) and 3 of the
ECM genes (COL19A1, ECM1, and DKK1), whereas a smaller num-
ber of genes [21] showed agreement with the FSHD1 muscle bi-
opsy samples. The smaller number of reproducible targets in the
biopsy samples compared with the myotubes may be because of
the presence of nonmuscle cells in the biopsies. A total of 49
genes from our microarray dataset were found to be in common
with the microarray targets of Tsumagari et al. The remaining 609
probes identified in our study, but not reflected in the Yao et al.
and Tsumagari et al. datasets, may be due to differences between
the cellular models used. Although the skeletal muscle biopsies/
myotubes used in the other two studies consisted of adult cells,
the hESC-myotube model we developed is embryonic in nature.
Consequently, the dysregulated genes identified here are distinct
from those previously reported in biopsies or primary myoblast
derivatives. Our stem cell-based model may better recapitulate
the early stages of the disease and could be more useful in iden-
tifying consistent gene dysregulations that are important for
the onset or predisposition of the disease. In adult biopsies/
myotubes, the original FSHD1 phenotypes may be obscured by
adaptive or epigenetic changes that occur over time in the
later-stage development of the disease. Some of the lack of con-
sistency between our data and the RNA-seq study from Yao et al.
may be further explained by the comparison of our microarray
data to the more sensitive RNA-seq method that can detect lower
levels of gene expression and dysregulation (e.g., in the case of
ZSCAN4 and MBD3L2).
Validation of FSHD1 Microarray Target Genes
ToconfirmtheFSHD1microarraydata,weperformedRT-qPCRon
myotubes derived from two FSHD1 hESC lines (GENEA049 and
GENEA050) and compared them against two unaffected control
lines (GENEA015 and GENEA019). We focused on the 4q35 locus
genes ANT1 and PDLIM3, DUX4 target PITX1, and genes repre-
sentative of three biological functions and signaling pathways
identified by IPA: GSTT1, Notch1, Dll1, and MSTN. Using only
independent cDNAs not subjected to the microarray experi-
ments, we validated seven sets of microarray-determined
FSHD1-associated differences in gene expression. As shown
in Figure 4A, all genes tested by RT-qPCR showed reproducible
upregulation and downregulation consistent with the microarray
findings.
Because several genes involved in oxidative stress response
were dysregulated in our model, we performed a ROS detection
assayonhealthyandFSHD1myotubesusingaspecificfluorogenic
probe (Materials and Methods). Under the same imaging condi-
tions, we detected a higher level of endogenous ROS in FSHD1
myotubes (27%–40% fluorescence-positive cells) than in control
cells(16%–18%;Fig.4B)thatcouldbecorrelatedwiththeincrease
of ROS detoxification enzymes GSTT1 and CAT and is consistent
with the higher level of oxidative stress observed in skeletal mus-
cles of FSHD patients [49]. The specificity of the staining was con-
firmed by the increased number of fluorescence-positive cells
observed in both healthy and FSHD1 myotubes after 30 min-
utes of exposure to 25 mM pyocyanin (supplemental online
Fig. 7A).
ToinvestigatethebiologicalrelevanceoftheFSHD-associated
dysregulation of cell-cycle genes observed on the microarray,
we performed a cell proliferation assay on myotube cultures, us-
ing EdU staining. As shown in Figure 4C and supplemental online
Figure 7B, only 3%–6% of cells stained positive for EdU in non-
affected and BMD control myotube cultures. However, FSHD
myotube cultures presented a higher number of proliferating
cells, with 10%–12% EdU-positive nuclei. Although DUX4 siRNA
knockdown had no effect on cell proliferation in unaffected
SkMC, the number of proliferating cells was reduced in FSHD1-
SkMCs transfected with siDUX4 (supplemental online Fig. 7C),
demonstrating a correlation between DUX4 expression level
and cell proliferation in the FSHD1 lines. This result is consistent
with increased expression of Notch signaling components (Notch1
and DLL1) observed in FSHD1-SkMCs (Table 1) and suggests
the dysregulation of cell proliferation as an early phenotype
in FSHD.
Inordertoidentifythe nature ofthe proliferativecellsinmyo-
tube cultures, we investigated the identity of the unfused cells in
culture at d26. Because myotubes are usually surrounded by un-
differentiated myogenic cells in culture, we analyzed the expres-
sion of the early myogenic markers PAX3, PAX 7, and MYOD1 in
two controls and two FSHD1 lines. Results showed that in unaf-
fected cell lines, 15% of the nuclei were MYOD1+, whereas
5%–20% were PAX3+ and only 4%–10% were PAX7+. In FSHD1
myotube cultures, 27%–35% of the nuclei were MYOD1+,
whereas only 8% were PAX3+ and 5%–7% were PAX7+ (Fig. 4D,

 4F). These results show that, although differentiation efficiency is
similar in all cell lines (65%–70% MHC+ nuclei), the number of
MYOD1-expressing cells is increased in FSHD1 myotube cultures
and correlates with the FSHD1-specific upregulation of MYOD1
mRNA detected in our microarray analysis (Table 1). PAX3 and
PAX7 were exclusively detected in the nuclei of mononucleated
unfused cells (Fig. 4D). However, as indicated by the white arrow
in Figure 4D, a small proportion of MYOD1+ nuclei were found
withinmyotubesandarenot exclusiveto theunfused population.
To identify and determine the proportion of proliferating cells in
each population (MYOD1+, PAX3+, and PAX7+), we performed
coimmunostaining with a Ki67 antibody. As expected, Ki67+ nu-
clei were only detected in unfused cells, and not in MHC+ myo-
tubes (Fig. 4E). The number of Ki67+ cells was increased in
the two FSHD1 myotube cultures, with 3%–6% of the cells being
proliferative in control lines versus 11%–13% in FSHD1 lines, con-
firming the EdU results (Fig. 4G). Quantification of the coimmu-
nostaining revealed that in healthy lines, 5% of MYOD1+ cells,
2%–5% of PAX3+, and 2%–5% of PAX7+ cells were Ki67+, indicat-
ing that only a small proportion of the myogenic undifferentiated
cells were proliferating. In FSHD1-myotube cultures, the percent-
ages of Ki67+ cells were increased to 10%–12% for MYOD1+, 7%
for PAX3+, and 10%–13% for PAX7+ cells, demonstrating an in-
crease of proliferation in each population of unfused cells (Fig.
4H; supplemental online Fig. 7D). A fraction of proliferative cells
remains unidentified in our study, but they are in all likelihood
myogenic cells at an intermediate stage and expressing myogenic
markers that we have not tested.
FSHD-hiPSC-SkMCs Share Similar Phenotypes
With FSHD-hESC-SkMCs
Induced pluripotent stem cells represent an alternative patient-
specific source of SkMCs that share common characteristics with
hESCs and may be exploited for clinical applications. We assessed
whether three independent patient-specific iPSC lines, including
one control (HFF) and two affected with FSHD1 (FSHD-43.1 and
FSHD-83.6) [30], could be differentiated into SkMCs using
our established skeletal muscle differentiation protocol. As for
hESC lines, there is no familial relationship between the control
and the disease lines. Details of the hiPSC lines are presented
supplemental online Table 1. Cells were exposed to the series
of skeletal muscle media as described in Materials and Methods.
After 26 days of differentiation, we found 40%–60% MF20+, Dys-
trophin+, and SkMHC+ multinucleated myotubes in differenti-
ated cultures derived from the three hiPSC lines (Fig. 5A). As in
hESC, FSHD-hiPSCs differentiated into SkMCs with the same effi-
ciencyastheunaffectedcontrolline(Fig.5A),andFSHDmyotubes
exclusively expressed DUX4, ZSCAN4, and MBD3L2 mRNAs
(supplemental online Fig. 8A). The two 4q35 genes ANT1 and ALP
were also upregulated in FSHD1-hiPSC myotubes (supplemental
online Fig. 8B). In order to characterize the FSHD-hiPSC-derived
SkMCs and determine whether they exhibit the same FSHD-specific
changes as FSHD-hESC-derived SkMCs, we performed a detailed
analysis of hiPSC myotube morphology, as described above. As
observed in hESCs, FSHD-hiPSC myotubes were thinner than un-
affected myotubes, with smaller average, median, and maximal
diameters (Fig. 5B). Our data showed that 8%–12% of FSHD-
hiPSC myotubes appeared thin (,5 mm), compared with only
4% of control myotubes (Fig. 5C). FSHD-hiPSC myotubes were
also shorter than unaffected ones, with an average length of
415–421 mm versus 566 mm, respectively (Fig. 5D), and showed a
smallernumberofnucleipermyotube(Fig.5E).Resultsofindividual
experiments are also shown in supplemental online Figure 7C.
Lastly, to assess the cell-cycle dysregulation in FSHD-hiPSC lines,
we performed a cell proliferation assay on hiPSC-SkMCs. As ob-
served in hESCs, EdU staining revealed a higher number of pro-
liferating cells in FSHD-hiPSC-SkMCs (18%) than unaffected
hiPSC-SkMCs (8%) (Fig. 5F, 5G). Together, these results show that
hiPSCs can be efficiently differentiated into SkMCs by using our
monolayer culture system. Reassuringly, FSHD-hiPSC-SkMCs also
share similar disease-specific phenotypes with FSHD-hESC-SkMCs.
DISCUSSION
Inthe lastdecade, therehas been remarkableprogress inthe field
ofhPSCresearch.Theirunlimitedself-renewalanddifferentiation
capacity has brought considerable attention and opportunities to
use hPSCs as a cellular source for regenerative medicine, disease
modeling, and drug screening platforms. Although patient-
specific hiPSCs have been prepared from FSHD patients, skeletal
muscle differentiation has not been reported [30]. Although
disease-specific iPSCs and hESCs should have very similar proper-
ties, a recent publication indicates that hESCs are superior to
hiPSCs and represent the “gold standard” [50]. Furthermore,
FSHD is modulated by epigenetic changes. It is not clear yet
whether FSHD-related epigenetic signatures are effectively
erased during cellular reprogramming and how that might affect
disease phenotypes during development. Therefore, hESCs seem
abetterchoicetomodelFSHDandshouldatleastbeusedside-by-
side with hiPSCs. Here we report a hESC-based cellular model for
FSHD. Weshow, for the first time, that SkMCs derived from FSHD-
affectedhESCsundergochangesreflectiveofFSHDpathologyand
therefore constitute useful tools in both basic research and novel
drug discovery. We further demonstrate similar disease-specific
phenotypes in two FSHD-affected hiPSC lines.
Although some insights into FSHD have been generated in
murinemodels,itisbecomingincreasingly clearthatthereareim-
portant differences between the two species in regard to princi-
ples and pathways of myogenesis, and that no mouse model
accurately reflects the human condition [14]. The development

FSHD Stem Cell Model

STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
 ofa human stem cellmodel offers a newapproach for the primary
studyofFSHDandhumanmusculardisordersingeneralandcould
have an important impact on the development of new therapies.
Efforts to generate human cellular models for FSHD havesuffered
from an absence of a renewable source of SkMCs and an inability
to generate SkMCs in vitro. Although a number of protocols are
now available for the generation of SkMCs from hPSCs, most of
these methods involve an intermediate stage of a 3D embryoid
bodyorsphereformation[22–24]and/orcellsorting[25],twoap-
proaches that are labor-intensive and offer limited scalability. Al-
though each of these methods represents a significant advance in
the field, none are easily scalable to the extent required for dis-
ease modeling, high-throughput screening, or cell therapy. Here
we report a simple, but highly efficient, three-step process for the
differentiation of hPSCs into mature SkMCs. One major advan-
tage of our monolayer system is that a large quantity of SkMCs
can beprepared without additionalmanipulations, such as forced
expression of myogenic genes or cell sorting. Because they are
highly proliferative, myogenic progenitors and myoblasts can
be expanded on a large scale through commonly used passaging
methods and provide a large amount of differentiated myotubes.
The simplicity and high efficiency of our method lends itself to au-
tomation and large-scale production. We typically produce more
than 75 million SkMCs, starting from 6 3 104 hPSCs, demonstrat-
ing the efficiency and scalability of our system. Skerjanc and col-
leagues first published an embryoid body (EB)-based protocol
that demonstrated the capacity of hESCs to differentiate into
SkMCs in vitro, but resulted in a poor myogenic induction and
low numbers of myogenic precursors (7%) and SkMCs (4%)
[24]. A promising chemically defined monolayer approach was
later reported by Borchin et al., but still produced a low yield
of myogenic cells and required the purification of PAX3+/PAX7+
myogenic precursors (18%) or AchR+ myocytes (8%) from a het-
erogeneous cell population [25]. As an alternative to EB forma-
tion, Hosoyama et al. presented a new suspension-culture
technique, called “EZ sphere,” to direct skeletal myogenesis in
hESCs. Although this technique improvedthe myogenic induction
and differentiation (30% MHC+ cells after 8 weeks), it also re-
sultedinamixedpopulation ofmyogenic (20%)andneuronalpre-
cursors (30%) in the EZ sphere [23]. A different method was
established by Maffioletti et al. for the derivation and inducible
differentiation of myogenic cells from hPSCs. Despite its high ef-
ficiency (up to 90%MHC+ cells), this lengthyprotocol requires the
use of an integrating lentiviral vector encoding for MyoD1 to in-
duce myogenic differentiation, which represents a major limita-
tion for SkM production [21]. Recently, Shelton et al. reported
a scalable protocol that generates 50% SkMCs without EB forma-
tion, cell sorting, or genetic manipulations. Nonetheless, myo-
tubes appear only after 50 days of differentiation [28, 29],s
whereas mature myotubes are formed within less than 26 days
in our system. Besides, it is not clear whether this method is
adaptable to all hPSCs because others have failed to reproduce
theirresultsusinghiPSCs[27].Whilewewerepreparingthisstudy
for publication, a monolayer and serum-free skeletal muscle dif-
ferentiation protocol for mouse and human PSC was published by
Chal et al. [27]. Although their method seems highly efficient in
terms of percentage of muscle fibers produced, it is not scalable
because a yield of only 50,000–70,000 SkMCs can be obtained
from seeding 75,000 hPSCs. At present, we can only speculate
on the reasons for this because the two methods share some sim-
ilarities. However, we do find the use of Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium with knockout serum replacement (as used by
Chal et al.) to be antagonistic to high yields of SkMCs in our pro-
tocol (unpublished data). Furthermore, the authors report differ-
entiation to human myotubes from only three iPSC lines [27]. In
contrast, we and other groups have successfully differentiated
more than 20 hPSC lines using our method. The relatively short
time of our skeletal muscle differentiation process and its high
yield of SkMC production represent a significant advance in the
field. Furthermore, our system is robust, applicable to a variety
ofhESCsandhiPSCs.Itishighlyreproducible,withsmallvariability
between cell lines and experiments, as demonstrated by the con-
sistencyofmarkerexpressionandmicroarrayresults.Ourskeletal
muscle differentiation protocol is therefore suitable for high-
throughput screening and drug development.
Using our system, we have developed a cellular model for
FSHD and show, for the first time, disease-specific phenotypes
in hPSC-SkMCs affected with FSHD. Many studies have addressed
the dysregulation of 4q35 genes, proximally located to the D4Z4
region, with inconclusive results. In our study, three of the 4q35
FSHD locus genes (DUX4, ANT1, and PDLIM3) were dysregulated.
Interestingly, upregulation of PDLIM3 was observed in fetal FSHD
biopsies [51], but no noticeable changes were reported in adults
[52, 53], correlating with the embryonic nature of our model.
Consistent with other studies [42, 44, 52], no significant elevation
of FRG1, FRG2, and LRP2BP expression was detected in FSHD
myotubes. However, we cannot exclude low levels of dysregula-
tion that are beyond the sensitivity of our microarrays. Also,
we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the 4q35 genes
(i.e., FRG1) may be transiently dysregulated during intermediate
steps of the differentiation process that we have not tested [54].
It has been previously claimed that in FSHD muscles, DUX4
initiates a gene dysregulation cascade, causing muscle atrophy
and oxidative stress [38, 39], and in some cases, differentiation
defects [52]. In our FSHD model, despite a clear reduction of
MYOD1-expressing cells at the myoblast stage, we did not ob-
serve any differentiation defect, but noticed an alteration of
the fusion process, resulting in shorter myotubes and a smaller
number of nuclei per myotube. We confirmed FSHD-specific
DUX4 expression, thinner myotubes, and dysregulation of genes
related to oxidative stress response, three key FSHD features. A
higher level of endogenous ROS was also detected in FSHD1 myo-
tubes, supporting the idea thatoxidative stress causedby ROS im-
balancemight play a role inFSHDpathophysiological mechanisms
[34, 49, 55]. Although we did not detect any significant cell pro-
liferationchangesduringtheFSHD1-hESCdifferentiationprocess,
we did find a higher number of proliferative cells in FSHD1-hESC
myotube cultures. This finding appear to be in contradiction with
the blockage of cell cycle progression observed in FSHD1 pa-
tient myoblasts [40]. The different cellular models (adult vs. em-
bryonic)and/ormyogenicstages(myoblastsvs.myotubes)tested
could explain this discrepancy. Nonetheless, our study supports
the growing idea of cell cycle dysregulation in FSHD1 [40, 56].
Also, the lower number of MYOD1+ cells at the myoblast stage
followed by the higher number of MYOD+ cells observed at a
later stage in FSHD1-myotube cultures could suggest a slight
delayinthedifferentiationprocessofFSHD1-hESCs.Thishypoth-
esis should be investigated in future studies. Lastly, in a recent
publication, Banerji et al. identified Wnt signaling, via b-catenin,
as one of the key pathways disturbed in FSH, as well as actin cy-
toskeleton signaling and ROS. Our study revealed the same im-
portant pathways, although a direct side-by-side comparison of

 the data is not possible because of the different methodology
[57]. Together, our results recapitulate some of the previously
reported defects of FSHD1 and could provide new insights into
the early events of the disease.
We noted similar effects in our three FSHD hESC lines and two
hiPSC lines, although GEN096 showed a milder phenotype. The
five FSHD-hPSC lines reported here have low D4Z4 copy number
(5–6 repeats). It has been suggested that patients with high copy
number (7–10 repeats) show much greater clinical variability in
severity of phenotype. It would be interesting to see whether cell
lineswithhigherD4Z4copynumberdisplayagreatervariabilityof
phenotypes.Unfortunately,suchcelllineswerenotavailableand,
toourknowledge,havenotbeenreportedintheliterature.More-
over, an isogenic correction of one of the FSHD-hPSC lines would
bethebestcontroltodemonstratethecorrelationbetweenDUX4
expression and morphological changes in FSHD myotubes. How-
ever, in the case of FSHD, gene editing to modulate the number of
D4Z4repeats would bedifficult because ofthe presence ofrepeat
sequences inthe D4Z4array chromosome 4 and its duplication on
chromosome 10.
CONCLUSION
We have developed an efficient and robust monolayer culture
system that enables the scalable production of skeletal muscle
cells from hPSCs in a reasonable time frame and without genetic
manipulation. This method, when combined with our bank of
disease-affected hESC lines (http://www.geneastemcells.com.au),
allows us to produce disease-specific human SkMCs with broad ap-
plications in modeling muscular diseases. Using this strategy, we
have demonstrated, for the first time, FSHD-specific molecular
and morphological phenotypes in hPSC-derived SkMCs. Those
data are the basis for the development of high-content pheno-
typic assays and promise great potential for cell-based drug
screening. This unique cellular model will be a useful resource
for FSHD research, help to better understand the disease
mechanism, and ultimately assist in the development of effec-
tive treatments.
