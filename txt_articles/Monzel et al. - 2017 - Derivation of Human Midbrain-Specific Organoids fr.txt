SUMMARY
Research on human brain development and neurological diseases is limited by the lack of advanced experimental in vitro models that
truly recapitulate the complexity of the human brain. Here, we describe a robust human brain organoid system that is highly specific
to the midbrain derived from regionally patterned neuroepithelial stem cells. These human midbrain organoids contain spatially orga-
nized groups of dopaminergic neurons, which make them an attractive model for the study of Parkinson’s disease. Midbrain organoids are
characterized in detail for neuronal, astroglial, and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, we show the presence of synaptic
connections and electrophysiological activity. The complexity of this model is further highlighted by the myelination of neurites.
The present midbrain organoid system has the potential to be used for advanced in vitro disease modeling and therapy development.
INTRODUCTION
With the development of methods to generate induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells (Takahashi
and Yamanaka, 2006; Yu et al., 2007), human cells with the
potential to generate all body cell types in vitro became
available. This advance led to tremendous progress in the
development of protocols for the differentiation of iPSCs
into various human cell types. In addition, disease-specific
human iPSCs and their derived cell types are now widely
used for in vitro disease modeling. However, particularly
with regard to neuronal diseases, it is of importance to
consider that the human brain is an extremely complex,
three-dimensional (3D) structure. Consequently, the inves-
tigation of its development and modeling of disease pro-
cesses in traditional, two-dimensional cultures has strong
limitations. It has been demonstrated that the presence
of a 3D matrix promotes many biologically relevant func-
tions, such as differentiation capability (Baharvand et al.,
2006; Greiner et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2004; Tian et al.,
2008), cellular signaling, and lineage specification (Engler
et al., 2006; Greiner et al., 2013; McBeath et al., 2004). In
addition, 3D culture systems are more physiological con-
cerning cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (Lee et al.,
2007). These observations have, in recent years, prompted
the use of human iPSCs for the generation of 3D in vitro
models of complete organs, the so-called organoids.
These organoid technologies have been pioneered for
the small intestine (Sato et al., 2009) and later extended
also to other organs or parts of organs (Nakano et al.,
2012). Recently, protocols for the generation of human
brain-like organoids have been developed, including pro-
tocols for cerebral (Lancaster et al., 2013), cerebellar (Mu-
guruma et al., 2015), midbrain-like (Jo et al., 2016), and
forebrain organoids (Qian et al., 2016). These organoids
provide a proof of concept that human iPSCs can indeed
differentiate into various cell types and even self-organize
with a specific spatial orientation, which recapitulates key
features of the human brain. These brain organoids have
been used successfully to model a genetic form of micro-
cephaly (Lancaster et al., 2013) as well as Zika virus-
induced microcephaly (Qian et al., 2016). Importantly,
thus far all brain organoids have been generated directly
from iPSCs; however, evidence suggesting that these orga-
noids could also be derived from more fate-restricted neu-
ral stem cells is lacking. The utilization of neural stem cells
as the starting population has the advantage that already
patterned cells might differentiate into the desired struc-
tures more efficiently (cheaper, faster cell doublings, ease
of handling, and so forth). Furthermore, while the gener-
ation of certain brain structures, such as the cerebral
cortex or cerebellum, is meanwhile well described, a
higher degree of prepatterning seems to be required for
the generation of other highly specialized structures.
This is particularly true for brain regions severely affected
by neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (hippocampus) or Parkinson’s disease (PD; substantia
nigra).

 To address these challenges, we used our previously
described human neuroepithelial stem cell (NESC) culture
system (Reinhardt et al., 2013) and differentiated these
NESCs under dynamic conditions into human midbrain-
specific organoids.
RESULTS
Generation of Human Midbrain-Specific Organoids
Previously described NESCs (Reinhardt et al., 2013) were
used as the starting population for the generation of hu-
man midbrain organoids (hMOs). Compared with iPSCs
as a starting population, NESCs are already patterned to-
ward midbrain/hindbrain identity. Therefore, an efficient
differentiation into hMOs was expected.
Typically, NESCs express the neural progenitor markers
SOX1, SOX2, PAX6, and Nestin prior to organoid genera-
tion (Figure S1A). Cells were seeded on round-bottomed
ultra-low-adhesion 96-well plates, enabling the cells to
form 3D colonies. They were cultured in the presence of
the GSK3b inhibitor CHIR99021 to stimulate the canonical
WNT signaling pathway, and the SHH pathway was acti-
vated using purmorphamine (PMA). The 3D NESC colonies
were embedded into droplets of Matrigel for structural sup-
port, and 2 days later differentiation into hMOs was initi-
ated. We kept the organoids on an orbital shaker rotating
at 80 rpm (Figure 1A). All experiments were conducted
with four different and independent NESC lines, individu-
ally derived from four different and independent human
iPSC lines (Table S1).
During the first 12 days of culture, the hMOs rapidly
increased in size and reached a mean core size of
1.26 mm (±0.06 mm, n = 4) in diameter after 20 days (Fig-
ure 1B). Consistent with the finding that organoids
increased in size after starting the differentiation, we
observed expression of the cell proliferation marker Ki67
at day 27 (referred to as early-stage hMOs), which signifi-
cantly decreased upon maturation until day 61 (late-stage
hMOs) from 2.32% (±0.7%, n = 4) to 0.13% (±0.08%,
n = 4) (Figures 1C, 1E, and 1G). Furthermore, young
hMOs expressed the neural progenitor marker SOX2,
which also significantly decreased during maturation
from 35% (±3%, n = 4, day 27) to 18.4% (±1.7%, n = 4,
day 61). Interestingly, the localization of SOX2-positive
cells became more regionally restricted by day 61, resem-
bling the formation of a stem cell niche (Figures 1D, 1F,
and 1G). Although consistent with previous findings (Lan-
caster and Knoblich, 2014; Lancaster et al., 2013), we found
substantial cell death in the core of the hMOs, which re-
sulted from the lack of nutrient support in the center of
the organoid. In general we did not observe high levels of
apoptotic cell death, revealed by staining of the marker
cleaved caspase-3. The basic level of apoptosis that was
detectable did not change during the course of differentia-
tion (Figure S1B). Importantly, we were able to reproduce
the generation of hMOs from NESCs, which were previ-
ously derived from four independent iPSC lines.
Neuronal Differentiation and Self-Organization of
NESC-Derived hMOs
After showing a decrease of proliferation and stem cell
identity, we assessed neuronal differentiation. Because we
are particularly interested in the future utilization of
hMOs for in vitro modeling of PD, we also investigated
the differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons
(mDNs). We were able to see robust differentiation into
TUJ1-positive neurons and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) pos-
itive mDNs. These stainings revealed the formation of a
complex neuronal network (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B).
We further examined whether the organoids undergo
differentiation into mDNs with midbrain identity. We
observed a large population of TH-, LMX1A-, and FOXA2-
positive neurons in late-stage hMOs (Figure 2C). Flow-cy-
tometry analysis of late-stage hMOs revealed that 64%
(±2.4%, n = 4) of the cells were triple-positive for TH,
LMX1A, and FOXA2 (Figure 2D). To further confirm the
regional identity of the hMOs, we stained for the orphan
nuclear receptor NURR1, which is widely expressed in
mDNs. NURR1 expression was observed in early- and
late-stage hMOs. We identified cells that co-expressed
NURR1 with the midbrain-specific transcription factor
OTX2 (Figure 2E) and the mDN marker TH (Figure S2C).
We further found cells that co-expressed NURR1 with the
ventral marker NKX6-1 (Figures 2F and S2D). We next
examined the expression of PITX3, an important transcrip-
tion factor for the differentiation and maintenance of
mDN during development. We found cells co-expressing
PITX3 with TH in the late-stage hMOs (Figure S2E) as well
as a small population of cells co-expressing PITX3 with
NKX6-1 (Figure S2F). Taken together, these results indicate
a differentiation toward ventral midbrain identity in the
hMOs described here.
To further address the identity of mDNs in these organo-
ids, we stained for the dopamine transporter (DAT), which
is a defining marker for mDNs. In late-stage hMOs we iden-
tified cells co-expressing TH and DAT (Figure 1G), as well as
cells positive for FOXA2/DAT (Figure S2G) and TH/dopa-
mine decarboxylase (DDC) (Figure S2H). qRT-PCR further
confirmed the upregulation of the three mDN differentia-
tion markers TH, DAT, and DDC in late-stage hMOs (Fig-
ure 2H). Previously, expression of PAX6 in the midbrain
but not in mDNs has been shown (Duan et al., 2013;
Schwarz et al., 1999). To further confirm the identity of
the mDNs, we stained for PAX6 and TH. We could not
identify TH-positive mDNs co-expressing PAX6, further

 supporting that the hMOs contain authentic mDNs (Fig-
ure S2I). Intriguingly, we observed robust co-expression
of GIRK2 with TH in late-stage hMOs, revealing the pres-
ence of the A9 subtype mDNs (Figure 2I), but we also
observed cells double-positive for CALBINDIN (CALB)
and TH in late-stage hMOs, indicating the presence of
A10 subtype mDNs (Figure 2J). These data confirm that
our hMOs contain A9 and A10 subtype mDNs.
In previous studies it has been repeatedly shown that
stem cells exhibit an enormous potential to self-organize
into complex heterogeneous brain organoids (Eiraku and
Sasai, 2012; Eiraku et al., 2008; Lancaster et al., 2013; Mu-
guruma et al., 2015). To examine the degree of spatial orga-
nization in hMOs, we evaluated the distribution pattern of
the mDN markers TUJ1/TH and depicted the results using
surface plots. Strikingly, we found that mDNs formed
clearly specified clusters within hMOs (Figures 2K and
2L). To further demonstrate the identity of TH-positive
neurons as dopaminergic, we analyzed their ability to pro-
duce the neurotransmitter dopamine. Immunostaining of
mature hMOs demonstrated the presence of dopamine,
TH, and MAP2 triple-positive cells (Figure 2M). Intrigu-
ingly, we occasionally even observed the formation of
Fontana-Masson staining-positive neuromelanin granules
in the hMO cultures (Figure S2J).
Altogether these results indicate that mDNs of NESC-
derived organoids self-organize into a complex, spatially
patterned neuronal tissue.
Glial Differentiation in hMOs
During the development of the fetal human brain, neural
tube-derived cells not only differentiate into neurons but
also into glia cells, including astrocytes and oligodendro-
cytes. Therefore, we investigated the presence of these
glia cells in the hMOs. In good agreement with brain
development, where glia differentiation temporally follows
neuronal differentiation, we were unable to detect sig-
nificant amounts of glia cells in young hMOs (day 27).
However, in more mature organoids (day 61), we observed
a significant increase of S100B-positive astrocytes (up to
4%) (Figure 3A). We confirmed astrocyte identity by co-
staining of S100B with the astrocyte markers Aquaporin
(AQP4) and Vimentin (VIM) (Figure 3B). Moreover, we de-
tected a fraction of cells that differentiated into O4-positive
oligodendrocytes (Figure S3A). In the CNS, mature oligo-
dendrocytes form myelin sheaths that enwrap axons to
accelerate the transmission of action potentials along
axons. To analyze whether the oligodendrocytes within
the hMOs are able to execute their actual function, i.e., for-
mation of myelin sheets, we performed IF staining against
CNPase, a myelin-associated enzyme, together with the
neuronal marker TUJ1. A 3D surface reconstruction of
these stainings revealed numerous TUJ1-positive neurites
that were ensheathed by myelin sheets of CNPase-positive
oligodendrocytes (Figures 3C, S3B, and S3C). Interestingly,
these neurites often showed gaps of ensheathment, resem-
bling the formation of nodes of Ranvier (Figure 3C) that
allow for saltatory fast neuronal transmission. Moreover,
CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes that ensheath TUJ1-pos-
itive neurites were also positive for the mature oligoden-
drocyte marker myelin basic protein (MBP) (Figure 3D).
Quantification revealed that 29.6% (±2.4%, n = 4) of
TUJ1-positive neurites were ensheathed by oligodendro-
cytes as confirmed by image analysis using MBP and TUJ1
masks.
Functionality of hMOs
One important requirement for neuronal transmission is
the development of a mature neuronal network via the
formation of synaptic connections. Therefore, synaptic

 connectivity was investigated using IF staining against the
presynaptic marker Synaptophysin (SYP) and the postsyn-
aptic marker PSD95 at day 61. To assess the presynaptic and
postsynaptic density in hMOs, we quantified the number
of presynaptic and postsynaptic counts per mm2 to an
amount of 0.031 (±0.003; n = 4) and 0.016 (±0.004;
n = 4), respectively. A subsequent 3D surface reconstruction
demonstrated not only the formation of numerous pre-
and postsynaptic puncta but also multiple synaptic con-
nections (Figures 3E and S3D). Synaptic connections have
been developed between different neurites, indicated
by the direct contact of SYP-positive presynapses with
PSD95-positive postsynapses (Figure 3F). Accordingly,
hMOs fulfill the prerequisite to forward signals via synaptic
connections and thus for being electrophysiologically
functional.
To further address functionality and neuronal network
activity, we performed Fluo-4AM calcium imaging on
whole organoids. We measured the spontaneous neuronal
activity of six hMOs based on calcium transients evoked by
action potentials (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4; Movie S1).
Notably, some of the fluorescent traces showed regular
firing patterns, which were indicative of tonic electrophys-
iological activity and resembled the pacemaker activity of
mDNs (Hartfield et al., 2014; Moreno et al., 2015). We
quantified that 64% (±18%, n = 3) of the cells were actively
firing. In addition to calcium imaging, a multielectrode
array (MEA) system was used to examine the electrophysi-
ological activity. This methodology allows non-invasive
recordings of extracellular field potentials generated by
action potentials. At days 82–84, the hMOs were placed
on a grid of 16 electrodes in a 48-well tissue culture plate
(Figure 4C). Spontaneous activity was detected over several
days by individual electrodes in the form of mono- and
biphasic spikes (96.13 ± 66.8 spikes/active electrode/mea-
surement [n R 4], Figures 4D and 4E). Furthermore,
spikes occurred close in time on multiple electrodes, which
represents neuronal network synchronicity (Figure 4F). To
further address functionality, we treated the hMOs with
the dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist quinpirole (5 mM).
Indeed, after this treatment neuronal activity was reduced
(Figure 4G), confirming the presence of functional dopa-
mine receptors in the described hMOs. Together, these
findings indicate that hMOs develop functional synaptic
connections and show spontaneous neuronal activity.
DISCUSSION
One of the main limitations in neuroscience and the
modeling of neurological diseases is the lack of advanced
experimental in vitro models that truly recapitulate the
complexity of the human brain. Here we have presented
a human brain organoid system that is highly specific to
the midbrain. These hMOs contain spatially patterned
groups of dopaminergic neurons, which make them an
attractive model for the study of PD. hMOs are character-
ized in detail with regard to neuronal differentiation and
activity as well as for astroglia and oligodendrocyte
differentiation.
The presence of astrocytes is crucial for the formation of
synapses and regular neuronal activity (Chung et al., 2015).
Astrocytes are specified later than neurons during develop-
ment (Chaboub and Deneen, 2013; Molofsky et al., 2012).
Accordingly, hMOs show robust astrocyte immunoreac-
tivity only after 61 days of differentiation. Furthermore,
synaptic connections, consisting of a direct contact
between pre- and postsynapses, are detectable in the
hMOs. These synaptic contacts are the prerequisite for elec-
trophysiological
and
neuronal
network
functionality,
which we indeed detected in the hMOs by Ca2+ imaging
and MEA measurements. In addition, fast information
transmission between neurons depends on axonal myeli-
nation, which is achieved by oligodendrocytes. In most

 stem cell-based differentiation protocols, the differentia-
tion into oligodendrocytes is extremely inefficient (Bunk
et al., 2016; Jablonska et al., 2010). However, in the present
approach we achieved a robust differentiation into oligo-
dendrocytes and a high degree of neurite myelination.
Neurites in these hMOs are ensheathed by oligodendro-
cytes and even structures such as the nodes of Ranvier,
which are of critical importance for saltatory transmission
of signals in axons (Faivre-Sarrailh and Devaux, 2013),
become apparent.
Compared with other pioneering human brain organoid
systems, we are able to generate organoids of a remarkable
size (up to 2 mm in diameter) with high reproducibility.
Importantly, it was possible to reproducibly generate
hMOs based on iPSC lines that come from different origins
such as cord blood and fibroblasts. Additionally these
fibroblasts have been sampled from individuals at ages
from 53 years to 81 years (Table S1). Importantly, in
contrast to all other human brain organoid systems, our
starting population of cells are not iPSCs but NESCs (Rein-
hardt et al., 2013), which allows us to achieve an efficient
directed differentiation. Our approach is fully focused on
the midbrain, as shown by the abundant presence of neu-
rons with mDN identity. These neurons are asymmetrically

 distributed in a discrete cluster. This asymmetry mirrors a
unique feature of the human brain, where the soma of
mDNs reside in the substantia nigra. Furthermore, the pres-
ence of neuromelanin, which is a unique feature of the
primate brain, is an interesting finding.
The presented hMOs have a great potential to be used for
in vitro modeling of diseases that strongly affect the
human midbrain, particularly PD (Michel et al., 2016).
Patient-specific hMOs might reveal specific phenotypes
that are not abundant in 2D cultures and therefore may
be used for mechanistic studies and drug testing. Impor-
tantly,
such
a
pipeline would
be
fully suitable
for
approaches in personalized medicine (Bu et al., 2016; Hillje
and Schwamborn, 2016).
Neurodegenerative disorders, such as PD, are typically
considered to be age-associated diseases (Sepe et al., 2016;
Xu et al., 2016). However, there is accumulating evidence
that PD has a strong neurodevelopmental component
that probably defines the susceptibility to develop the dis-
ease (Garcia-Reitboeck et al., 2013; Le Grand et al., 2014).
This finding supports the importance of human brain
development models to investigate the disease’s under-
lying mechanisms.
Major limitations of the hMOs presented here, as well as
other published brain organoid systems, is the absence of
immune cells (microglia) and vasculature. The absence of
vasculature might limit the growth of organoids beyond a
certain size and the appearance of dead cells in the center
of the organoids. While the absence of microglia is a major
disadvantage for disease modeling, another option to reduce
the problem of the dead cells in the center of organoids
might be to produce smaller organoids. However, it seems
likely that there is a minimal size of an organoid required
to achieve key characteristics such as spatial asymmetry.
Despite these limitations, the hMO system presented here
along with other models may be a first step toward a more
human patient-specific, probably even personalized, era of
advanced disease modeling and therapy development.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Authorization from the National Ethics Committee for the work
with human iPSCs (CNER No. 201305/04; PDiPS from the Ethic
Review Panel of the University of Luxembourg) is in place.
For hMO generation, 9,000 human NESCs were plated in each
well of an ultra-low-attachment 96-well round-bottomed plate
(Corning) and cultured in N2B27 medium (DMEM-F12 [Invitro-
gen]/Neurobasal [Invitrogen] 50:50 with 1:200 N2 supplement
[Invitrogen], 1:100 B27 supplement lacking vitamin A [Invitro-
gen], 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin [Invitro-
gen]) containing 3 mM CHIR-99021 (Axon Medchem), 0.75 mM
purmorphamine (Enzo Life Science), and 150 mM ascorbic acid
(Sigma) (referred to as N2B27 maintenance medium). After
6 days, the colonies were transferred to ultra-low-attachment
24-well plates (Corning) and cultured in N2B27 maintenance me-
dium. On day 8, the 3D colonies were transferred to droplets of
hESC-qualified Matrigel (BD Bioscience) as previously described
(Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014). Droplets were cultured in N2B27
maintenance medium for 2 more days. On day 10, differentiation
was initiated with N2B27 medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL
human brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 10 ng/mL human
glial-derived neurotrophic factor, 500 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP
(Peprotech), 200 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma), and 1 ng/mL transform-
ing growth factor b3 (Peprotech). In addition, 1 mM purmorph-
amine (Enzo Life Science) was added to this medium for an
additional 6 days. On day 14 of the organoid culture, the plates
were placed on an orbital shaker (IKA), rotating at 80 rpm, in an
incubator and the organoids were kept in culture with media
changes every second or third day. A detailed description is pro-
vided in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
