During 1975–2012, CDC surveillance identified 1,680 trichi-
nellosis cases in the United States with implicated food items; 
among these cases, 1,219 were attributed to consumption of raw 
or pork products, and 461 were attributed to nonpork products. 
Although trichinellosis in the United States has historically been 
associated with consumption of pork, multiple nonporcine spe-
cies of wild game also are competent hosts for Trichinella spp. 
and have been collectively implicated in the majority of trichi-
nellosis cases since the late 1990s (1–4) (Figure 1). During 
July 2016–May 2017, the Alaska Division of Public Health 
(ADPH) investigated two outbreaks of trichinellosis in the Norton 
Sound region associated with consumption of raw or undercooked 
walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) meat; five cases were identified in each 
of the two outbreaks. These were the first multiple-case outbreaks 
of walrus-associated trichinellosis in Alaska since 1992 (Figure 2). 
Health care providers should inquire about consumption of 
commercially prepared and personally harvested meats when 
evaluating suspected trichinellosis cases, especially in areas where 
consumption of wild game is commonplace.
First Outbreak
The index patient (patient A) was an adolescent female who 
reported severe lower extremity edema and pain, difficulty walk-
ing, a pruritic rash, weakness, fever, and myalgia beginning on 
August 15, 2016 (Table). She was evaluated at a village health clinic 
on August 31, 2016, and referred to the Alaska Native Medical 
Center in Anchorage, where she was admitted on September 8. 
Her adolescent brother (patient B) and father (patient C) accom-
panied her to the medical center, where they were also evaluated 
for symptoms of illness (Table). Blood tests indicated that all three 
patients had eosinophilia, a commonly observed sign of parasitic 
infection; two patients also had elevated creatine kinase levels, 
indicative of muscle inflammation (Table). All three patients 
reported having consumed raw or pan-fried (to “medium” done-
ness) walrus meat on approximately July 17. Serologic tests from 
both patients A and C were positive for Trichinella immunoglobu-
lin G (IgG) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
The three patients received diagnoses of laboratory-confirmed 
(patients A and C) or probable (patient B) trichinellosis and were 
prescribed albendazole, an antiparasitic drug recommended for 
treatment of trichinellosis*; patient A also received prednisone.
On September 19, staff members of Norton Sound Regional 
Hospital in Nome reported two additional suspected trichi-
nellosis cases from the same community, in the adult aunt 
(patient D) and uncle (patient E) of patient A. Both patients 
reported myalgia and fatigue beginning on approximately 
August 7, about 1 week after consuming raw walrus meat 
(Table). Blood tests confirmed that both patients had eosino-
philia and elevated creatine kinase levels. ELISA testing identi-
fied IgG antibodies to Trichinella in patient D. Patients D and 
E received diagnoses of laboratory-confirmed and probable 
trichinellosis, respectively, and were treated with albendazole; 
patient E also received prednisone. Leftover walrus meat was 
not available to test for Trichinella larvae, and investigators 
could not determine when the walrus had been harvested, how 
widely associated meat had been shared, or whether all five 
patients had consumed meat from the same animal.
Interviews with patients and potentially exposed persons 
conducted by community health aides and staff members of 
the Nome Public Health Center did not identify any additional 
cases. Information regarding the health risks of consuming raw 
and undercooked meats was provided directly to the five patients. 
The risk reduction benefits of fully cooking meat according to 
U.S. Department of Agriculture recommendations for wild game 
(160°F [71°C], measured with a meat thermometer)† before 
consumption, as well as trichinellosis symptoms, health effects, 
and methods of treatment were explained. The facts that the 
parasite cannot be reliably killed by smoking, drying, or ferment-
ing meat, and that the arctic species T. nativa is freeze tolerant, 
were clarified. All five patients fully recovered. At the conclu-
sion of the investigation, ADPH began developing a related 
public service announcement in collaboration with regional and 
village-based partners, with planned dissemination in multiple 
communities throughout northern and western Alaska during 
the 2017 spring walrus harvest.
Second Outbreak
On May 12, 2017, as circulation of the public service 
announcement was beginning, ADPH was notified of 
another suspected case of walrus-related trichinellosis in a 
second Norton Sound coastal community, located <100 miles 
(<161 km) from the community where the first outbreak

occurred (Table). Residents of both communities harvest 
walrus from the same hunting grounds in the northern Bering 
Sea. The index patient in the second outbreak (patient F) was 
an adult male who had been transported to Norton Sound 
Regional Hospital on May 12, 2017, after reporting severe 
muscle and joint pain. Blood tests revealed eosinophilia and 
elevated creatine kinase levels, but Trichinella IgG results by 
ELISA were negative; he received a diagnosis of probable 
trichinellosis and was prescribed albendazole and prednisone.
Interviews conducted by staff members of ADPH and the 
Nome Public Health Center identified four other suspected 
cases based on reported illness or likely exposure via a shared 
meal of undercooked walrus meat on approximately April 25, 
2017. These patients were from two neighboring households that 
included members who hunted walrus together and shared the 
harvested meat. In the first household, the adult sister (patient G) 
and mother (patient H) of the index patient both had eosinoph-
ila, elevated creatine kinase levels, and positive Trichinella IgG 
results by ELISA; both patients were classified as having con-
firmed cases of trichinellosis. In the second household, an adult 
male friend and hunting partner of the index patient (patient I) 
and his adult sister (patient J) had eosinophilia and elevated 
creatine kinase levels, but negative results for Trichinella IgG by 
ELISA; both were classified as having probable cases. All four 
patients received treatment with albendazole. Given the high 
eosinophil counts and creatine kinase levels measured for the 
three patients with probable trichinellosis, it seems likely that 
these persons were infected but tested negative for Trichinella IgG 
by ELISA because the time elapsed between infection and testing 
was insufficient for a measurable humoral response.
The walrus consumed during the implicated meal in the sec-
ond outbreak had been harvested and butchered by patients F 
and I during the previous 1–3 months, and the meat had been 
stored frozen in unlabeled bags in their respective household 
chest freezers. The meat was prepared by patient H, who reported 
that she boiled it for approximately 1 hour, after which the exte-
rior was fully cooked, but the interior remained undercooked or 
raw, which was the desired result; interviewed persons reported 
that many community members prefer the taste and texture of 
undercooked or raw walrus meat to that of fully cooked meat.
No meat from the implicated meal was available for testing. 
Because of concern that some of the meat used to prepare the 
implicated meal (or from the same source animal) might still 
be present in bags in household chest freezers, a convenience

sample of meat from 11 bags was collected. It was not possible to 
determine the number and identity of source animals represented 
in this sample, or whether the sample contained meat from the 
same animal consumed as part of the implicated meal. Samples 
were sent to CDC’s Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria’s 
service for laboratory testing. One sample was positive for larvae 
of Trichinella spp. using differential interference contrast micros-
copy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers specific 
to internally transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2. The parasite was 
determined to be T. nativa by sequencing PCR products.
All patients from the second outbreak made a full recovery, 
and no additional cases were identified. Information associated 
with the public service announcement, including risk reduction 
benefits of cooking meat fully and trichinellosis symptoms, 
health effects, and methods of treatment, was shared with the 
patients and the community at large through meetings with 
multiple groups.
Discussion
Trichinellosis is a parasitic disease that results from consump-
tion of raw or undercooked meat infected by roundworm species 
in the genus Trichinella (5). Early signs and symptoms occur 
1–2 days after ingestion and include diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Systemic signs and symptoms, 
which typically occur 1–2 weeks after ingestion and last for 
1–8 weeks, include facial and periorbital edema, fatigue, fever 
(remittent) and chills, headache, muscle soreness, pruritus (with 
or without a rash), nausea, difficulty coordinating movement, 
neurologic complications, and cardiopulmonary impairment.§
The significance of wild game species in the epidemiology 
of trichinellosis is apparent in Alaska. Among 241 trichinel-
losis cases reported in the state since 1975, 227 (94%) were 
attributed to consumption of nonporcine wild game, includ-
ing ursid species (black bear [Ursus americanus], grizzly bear

[Ursus arctos], and polar bear [Ursus maritimus]) and pinniped 
species (walrus and sea ice–associated seal species). Under the 
Marine Mammal Protection Act,¶ Alaska Natives may harvest 
marine mammals for subsistence purposes. Walruses, polar 
bears, and several sea ice–associated seal species are important 
for the nutritional, cultural, and economic well-being of many 
coastal communities in northern and western Alaska.
Since 1975, 100 (41%) of the 241 trichinellosis cases reported 
in Alaska have been associated with walrus meat and another 
24 (10%) with walrus or seal meat. However, the frequency of 
walrus-associated trichinellosis in Alaska has declined sharply 
in recent years from an average of 6.3 cases per year (113 cases 
over 18 years) during 1975–1992, to an average of 0.5 cases 
per year (11 cases over 24.5 years) during 1993–2017 (as of 
July 1, 2017). Before the outbreaks described here, only one 
walrus-associated trichinellosis case had been reported in Alaska 
in the preceding 23 years. Reasons for this decline in incidence 
are unknown and might involve changes in parasite burden in 
walruses; the timing or location of walrus hunting; methods 
used to store, collect, handle, or prepare walrus meat for con-
sumption; reporting practices among ill persons; and clinical 
testing methods or practices. These outbreaks underscore the 
importance of inquiring about consumption of commercially 
prepared and personally harvested meats, and about methods 
of meat preparation, when evaluating suspected trichinellosis 
cases, especially in areas where consumption of wild game in 
association with recreational or subsistence hunting is common.
These outbreaks also highlight the importance of culturally 
sensitive public health messaging. In areas where wild game 
species are harvested for subsistence, traditional methods of col-
lecting, handling, preparing, storing, and consuming meat often 
have great cultural significance; however, some of these methods 
can be inconsistent with public health best practices. Rather 
than promoting or proscribing specific methods, public health 
messages that focus on communicating risks and explaining the 
manner and magnitude of risk reduction that can be achieved 
using different approaches (e.g., alternative methods of preparing 
meat for consumption) enable members of the target popula-
tion to make informed decisions that integrate their traditional 
practices with their awareness and tolerance of risks.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Trichinellosis has historically been a disease most frequently 
associated with consumption of raw or undercooked pork 
products; however, nonporcine wild game species are now 
collectively implicated in the majority of trichinellosis cases in 
the United States.
What is added by this report?
During July 2016–May 2017, two outbreaks of trichinellosis 
(five cases each) associated with consumption of raw or 
undercooked walrus meat occurred in Alaska. Walrus meat has 
been implicated in half of all trichinellosis cases reported in 
Alaska since 1975, yet the frequency of walrus-associated 
trichinellosis in the state has declined in recent years for 
unknown reasons. The two recent outbreaks were the first 
associated with consumption of walrus meat since 2002 and the 
first multiple-case outbreaks since 1992.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Wild game consumption should be considered when evaluating 
suspected trichinellosis cases. Related public health messaging 
should be culturally sensitive to traditional methods of food 
handling and preparation.
