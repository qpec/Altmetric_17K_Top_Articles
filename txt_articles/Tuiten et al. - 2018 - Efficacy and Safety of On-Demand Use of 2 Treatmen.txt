ABSTRACT
Background: In women, low sexual desire and/or sexual arousal can lead to sexual dissatisfaction and emotional
distress, collectively defined as female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD). Few pharmaceutical treatment
options are currently available.
Aim: To investigate the efficacy and safety of 2 novel on-demand pharmacologic treatments that have been
designed to treat 2 FSIAD subgroups (women with low sensitivity for sexual cues and women with dysfunctional
over-activation of sexual inhibition) using a personalized medicine approach using an allocation formula based on
genetic, hormonal, and psychological variables developed to predict drug efficacy in the subgroups.
Methods: 497 women (21e70 years old) with FSIAD were randomized to 1 of 12 8-week treatment regimens
in 3 double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding studies conducted at 16 research sites in the
United States. Efficacy and safety of the following on-demand treatments was tested: placebo, testosterone
(T; 0.5 mg), sildenafil (S; 50 mg), buspirone (B; 10 mg) and combination therapies (T 0.25 mg þ S 25 mg, T
0.25 mg þ S 50 mg, T 0.5 mg þ S 25 mg, T 0.5 mg þ S 50 mg, and T 0.25 mg þ B 5 mg, T 0.25 mg þ B 10
mg, T 0.5 mg þ B 5 mg, T 0.5 mg þ B 10 mg).
Outcomes: The primary efficacy measure was the change in satisfying sexual events (SSEs) from the 4-week baseline
to the 4-week average of the 8-week active treatment period after medication intake. For the primary end points, the
combination treatments were compared with placebo and the respective monotherapies on this measure.

inhibition, 0.5 mg T þ 10 mg B increased the number of SSEs from baseline compared with placebo (D ¼ 0.99, 95%
CI ¼ 0.17e1.82, P ¼ .019) and monotherapies (B: D ¼ 1.52, 95% CI ¼ 0.57e2.46, P ¼ .002; T: D ¼ 0.98, 95%
CI ¼ 0.17e1.78, P ¼ .018). Secondary end points followed this pattern of results. The most common drug-related side
effects were flushing (T þ S treatment, 3%; T þ B treatment, 2%), headache (placebo treatment, 2%; T þ S treatment,
9%), dizziness (T þ B treatment, 3%), and nausea (T þ S treatment, 3%; T þ B treatment, 2%).
Clinical Implications: T þ S and T þ B are promising treatments for women with FSIAD.
Strengths and Limitations: The data were collected in 3 well-designed randomized clinical trials that tested
multiple doses in a substantial number of women. The influence of T þ S and T þ B on distress and the
potentially sustained improvements after medication cessation were not investigated.
Conclusions: T þ S and T þ B are well tolerated and safe and significantly increase the number of SSEs in
different FSIAD subgroups. Tuiten A, van Rooij K, Bloemers J, et al. Efficacy and Safety of On-Demand Use

INTRODUCTION
Low sexual desire and/or arousal are the most common
sex-related complaints reported by women.1,2 This often results in
sexual dissatisfaction, which in turn affects psychological well-
being and can result in severe personal distress.3 These com-
plaints are classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) as female sexual interest/
arousal disorder (FSIAD).4 Although effective pharmacologic
treatments for erectile dysfunction have been available for 2 de-
cades,5 there are limited treatment options for women with
FSIAD. There is a clear need for pharmacologic treatment op-
tions, which is evident from the large number of off-label testos-
terone prescriptions for women with sexual dysfunction in the
United States (w4.1 million annually).6 Attempts to develop a
drug treatment for FSIAD have been guided by the principle of “1
size fits all” but have failed to acknowledge the complexity of fe-
male sexuality. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
recently approved flibanserin (Addyi; Sprout Pharmaceuticals,
Raleigh, NC, USA) for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire
disorder (HSDD; the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR] classification
of low sexual desire problems) in premenopausal women, making
it the first drug for this indication. However, this was not without
controversy.7 The average treatment effects were small, with only
approximately 10% more patients on flibanserin reporting clini-
cally meaningful improvement compared with placebo. Moreover,
there were major safety concerns.8 Another drug candidate for
HSDD is the injectable bremelanotide, which has recently suc-
cessfully completed 2 phase 3 trials,9 albeit with a high incidence
of adverse events. Such 1-size-fits-all approaches inherently leave
many women untreated, which is the reason we have taken a
different approach.
We describe the development of 2 on-demand products for
the treatment of FSIAD that use a novel personalized approach
to sexual medicine.10 This approach to treatment is guided by
known neurobiological mechanisms that are critically important
in sexual excitation and inhibition.11e14 In 1 subgroup of
patients, low sexual desire or arousal results from a central ner-
vous system that is relatively insensitive to sexual cues. In these
individuals, exposure to sexual stimuli (internal or external) fails
to trigger activation of the brain’s sexual excitatory mechanisms.
In another subgroup of patients, FSIAD symptoms result from
dysfunctional high levels of sexual inhibition elicited by sexual
stimulation.10,15e17
The 2 drug treatments described in this article are based on a
delay in the effect of sublingual testosterone (T) on sexual moti-
vation or desire. The administration of a single dose of 0.5 mg
sublingual T produces a short-duration peak in the plasma level of
T within 15 minutes, with a return to baseline within 2 to 3
hours.18,19 However, during a period of 3 to 6 hours after peak
plasma levels, sublingual T produces an increase in vaginal arousal
and
in
subjective
sexual
responses
in
sexually
functional
women.18,20 This delay in the effect of T has been observed in
other emotional and cognitive functions21,22 and likely involves
protein synthetic events caused by T in the hypothalamus and
elsewhere. Interestingly, the exogenously induced peak in T mimics
the endogenous peak that occurs naturally during ovulation, and it
is during this phase of the menstrual cycle that women typically
experience increased sexual motivation and desire.23e25
For men and women, an increase in sexual motivation is
required for phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors to increase
genital vasocongestion. Conversely, sublingual T increases the
brain’s responses to sexual cues, which in turn increases sexual
motivation

 desire.10,15,26 Accordingly, the treatment developed for women
with low sensitivity to sexual stimuli consists of a novel (dual-
route, dual-release, fixed-dose) combination tablet consisting of a
T coating for sublingual administration and an inner-core
component containing the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor
sildenafil (S). The inner-core component is coated with a
delayed-release matrix to ensure that the peak plasma concen-
tration of the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor coincides with
the window of increased sexual motivation induced by the sub-
lingual T.27 Thus, this combination enables an increase in genital
arousal through an increase in responsivity to sexual stimuli. The
treatment developed for women with high levels of sexual
inhibition also is a combination tablet coated with T and
combined with an inner-core component28 containing the
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor agonist buspirone (B).
The inner core of B also is coated with a delayed release matrix,
which ensures that the pharmacologic effects of B coincide with
the sexual motivational window induced by T. The requisite
serotoninergic effect of B is based on studies in which acute
treatments with 5-HT1A receptor agonists were found to decrease
extracellular concentrations of 5-HT.29,30 This in turn dampens
5-HT’s phasic inhibitory control in the prefrontal cortex.30,31
Thus, during exposure to sexual stimuli, female participants
who are prone to sexual inhibition respond to this combined
treatment with an increase in physiologic and subjective sexual
responses.17 These 2 combination tablets are designed to be
taken “on demand” (ie, only when desired, rather than contin-
uous daily, like flibanserin).
The personalized approach was further enhanced by the
invention of a novel demarcation formula based on a combina-
tion of genetic, hormonal, and psychological variables that
predict decreased sexual excitation or increased sexual inhibition.
Accordingly, before the start of treatment, the demarcation
formula was used to classify patients with FSIAD into 1 of the 2
subgroups: participants with low levels of sensitivity and partic-
ipants with high levels of inhibition. In each identified subgroup,
we tested the efficacy of placebo, the monotherapies, and 4
different dose combinations of the tablet (see Methods) associ-
ated with the right treatment group in randomized controlled
trials. The primary end point was the change in the number of
sexually satisfying events (SSEs) from the 4-week baseline to the
4-week mean of the 8-week active treatment period (ATP). This
change in the primary end point was recorded for various control
conditions (ie, placebo, monotherapies, and active treatments
[T þ S and T þ B]). It was anticipated based on earlier proof-of-
concept studies that the 2 combination drugs (especially at the
highest doses) would show the highest level of efficacy compared
with the control conditions.16,17
METHODS
Ethics Statement
The study protocol was approved by the central institutional
review board Chesapeake IRB (Columbia, MD, USA). The
study was carried out in compliance with the Declaration of
Helsinki (2008) and with the International Conference on
Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines for clinical
research (1996).
Study Design and Oversight
Double-blinded,
randomized,
placebo-controlled,
dose-
finding phase 2 studies (identical in study design) were con-
ducted at 16 sites in the United States. Data were collected,
managed, and analyzed under the supervision of the sponsor,
which was monitored by Rasmussen Biotech and Pharma
Consulting LLC (Princeton, NJ, USA). The participants,
investigators, and site personnel were blinded to study treatment
until database lock, as were the sponsor and those members of
the vendors’ staff who were involved (eg, site monitors). The first
study started on September 27, 2011 (first screening visit) and
the final study ended on September 26, 2014 (database lock).
The PSR-Group (Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) was responsible
for data management. The trials are registered under identifiers
NCT01432665,
NCT01743235,
and
NCT02101203
(ClinicalTrials.gov).
Study Population
The requisite sample size was determined by a power analysis,
which took account of the effect sizes found in previous
studies.16,17 The female participants included in this study were
21 to 70 years old and had been diagnosed with HSDD (based
on DSM-IV-TR criteria),32 with or without FSAD, but were
otherwise healthy. Our inclusion criteria also were consistent
with the current DSM-5 diagnosis of FSIAD. All diagnoses were
performed by a trained professional. A demarcation formula was
used to assign participants to 1 of the 2 FSIAD subgroups (see
text and eTables 1e3 and eFigures 1 and 2 of the supporting
information for a description of the formula and its develop-
ment). Participants who had been diagnosed with any psychiatric
disorder other than FSIAD were excluded. Those scheduled for
any other treatment for female sexual dysfunction during the
study period also were excluded. Potential participants were
excluded if they were using oral contraceptives containing anti-
androgens, estrogen more than 50 mg, potent cytochrome P450
3A4 inhibitors or inducers, nitrates, monoamine oxidase in-
hibitors, antidepressants, and/or T compounds. The cardiovas-
cular exclusion criteria included a history of myocardial
infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia in the previous
6 months. Other criteria were uncontrolled hypertension,
hypotension, atrial fibrillation or flutter, or any other significant
abnormality observed on an electrocardiogram. The gynecologic
exclusion criteria included pelvic inflammatory disease, vaginal
infection, previous prolapse and incontinence surgery affecting
the vaginal wall, abnormal uterine bleeding patterns, pregnancy,
and breastfeeding in the past 6 months. Perimenopausal women
were excluded, which was defined as cycle shortening or irregular
menstrual bleeding in the past 12 consecutive months and/or

 occurrence of vasomotor symptoms (eg, hot flashes, nocturnal
sweats) in combination with increased follicle-stimulating hor-
mone levels (>40 IU/L) for women at least 40 years old; for
women with a history of hysterectomy, perimenopausal status
was determined by assessing follicle-stimulating hormone levels
(>40 IU/L) and/or vasomotor symptoms. Women with clini-
cally relevant endocrine disease, neurologic disease, severe or
acute liver disease, or a history of severe hepatic impairment were
excluded. Participants were excluded if they had free and/or total
T levels that were beyond the upper limit of the central labo-
ratory’s reference range. All participants provided written
informed consent.
497 women were randomized to 1 of the 12 treatment regi-
mens (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials [CONSORT]
diagram, Figure 1): placebo, the monotherapies (T 0.5 mg, S 50
mg, and B 10 mg), and 4 types of combination tablets (con-
taining different dose combinations). In participants with low
levels of sensitivity, the doses of T þ S (milligrams) were T
0.25 þ S 25, T 0.25 þ S 50, T 0.5 þ S 25, and T 0.5 þ S 50.
The corresponding doses of T þ B (milligrams) for participants
with high levels of inhibition were T 0.25 þ B 5, T 0.25 þ B 10,
T 0.50 þ B 5, and T 0.50 þ B 10 (Figure 2).
Study Objective
The objectives of the clinical research program were to
investigate efficacy and safety and to perform dose selection of
T þ S and of T þ B. The goal was to include 210 women in
each FSIAD subgroup using the demarcation formula according
to the decision tree depicted in Figure 2.
Study Procedures
After a baseline period of 4 weeks, participants underwent an
8-week, single-blinded, placebo run-in (PRI) period, which was
intended to stabilize placebo responses before active treatment.
The PRI period was followed by an 8-week, double-blinded
ATP. Those participants who according to the demarcation
formula had low sensitivity (and therefore allocated to T þ S
treatments) were randomly assigned to 1 of the following
treatment arms: (i) placebo, (ii) S 50 mg, (iii) T 0.50 mg,
Figure 1. Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram shows the number of participants screened, randomized,
completed, and analyzed (intention-to-treat group). The number of participants randomized (n ¼ 497) differs from the total number
allocated (n ¼ 469) because 1 placebo arm was disqualified (see below). Imputation was used for missing data of participants who had
been discontinued but who had yielded data in at least 2 4-week periods (during the PRI period and the ATP, an observation corresponds to
�1 reported SED with medication intake). ATP ¼ active treatment period; CAG ¼ cytosine, adenine, guanine; PRI ¼ placebo run-in; SED ¼

participants who showed a high degree of sexual inhibition (and
therefore allocated to T þ B treatments) were assigned to 1 of the
following treatment arms: (i) placebo, (ii) B 10 mg, (iii) T 0.50
mg, (iv) T 0.25 mg þ B 5 mg, (v) T 0.25 mg þ B 10 mg, (vi) T
0.50 mg þ B 5 mg, or (vii) T 0.50 mg þ B 10 mg (Figure 2). All
dose combinations, including the placebo, were contained in
combination tablets that were identical in size, taste, texture, and
odor. The participants were instructed to take the study medi-
cation approximately 3 to 6 hours before they anticipated
engaging in sexual activity (ie, on-demand use). Each participant
was issued with 28 U of medication during each 8-week treat-
ment period. They were instructed to allow a minimum period
of at least 48 hours between individual doses.
The participants were interviewed every 4 weeks, at which
time they also completed questionnaires designed to assess sexual
function and mood. In addition, their vital signs were measured,
any signs of hyperandrogenism were evaluated, a pregnancy test
was administered, and any adverse events were monitored. A
psychological interview was conducted at weeks 8 and 16 to
evaluate each 8-week treatment period, at which time blood
samples were collected to assess each participant’s chemistry,
hematology, lipids, and hormones.
Demarcation Formula
The demarcation formula consisted of 5 biological and 5
psychological variables that are involved in sensitivity to sexual
stimuli and sexual inhibition. 4 biological variables are markers of
androgenic activity, known to influence sensitivity to sexual
stimuli. The 2nd digit to 4th digit ratio (2D:4D) is a marker for
prenatal T exposure, which has a critical influence on brain or-
ganization during the fetal period.33e35 High digit ratios are
assumed to have a relatively low sensitivity to sexual cues. The
trinucleotide cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansion
of the 1st exon of the androgen receptor polymorph is variable.
Longer CAG repeats result in weaker receptor transactivation,
resulting in less effective function of the androgen system.36,37
Figure 2. Study design and group demarcation procedure using the demarcation formula. The variables in the demarcation formula were
assessed while individuals were being screened for the 2 subgroups. The demarcation formula was calculated for all participants who had
been found to be eligible according to all other inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results obtained with this formula were used to allocate
the subject to 1 of the 2 subgroups. If the demarcation formula indicated a subject had low sensitivity, then she was allocated to 1 of the T þ
S study arms. Those with overactive inhibition were allocated to 1 of the T þ B study arms. Because studies for the 2 subgroups
were identical, the placebo and Tarms of the active treatment period (highlighted) could be pooled for comparisons with active treatment
periods. Pooled trial data and un-pooled data analyses over the 3 separate trials are described. B ¼ buspirone; S ¼ sildenafil;
T ¼ testosterone.

205
 Women with longer CAG repeats might be relatively insensitive
to sexual stimuli. The physiologic effects of androgens in women
are determined not only by serum testosterone but also by the
peripheral conversion of its precursors. The levels of the 2 main
metabolites of androgens—androsterone glucuronide and 3-a-
androstanediol glucuronide—could be better markers for andro-
genicity in women.38 Higher levels of these metabolites would be
reflective of higher sensitivity to sexual stimuli. The 5th biological
variable is the 5-HT1A receptor genotype. There are 3 genotypes:
CC, CG and GG. The GG genotype is believed to increase the
expression of the presynaptic somato-dendritic 5-HT1A auto-
receptor, which indicates enhanced “braking” of the presynaptic
serotonergic neuron, decreasing the activity of the serotonin sys-
tem. The serotonin system with a G allele is characterized by
relatively low basal (tonic) activity, a feature that is associated with
disinhibition.39,40 In these women, stimuli (including threatening
stimuli) more easily evoke an emotional response. Women who
have had adverse sexual experiences might initially desire sex but,
when exposed to actual stimuli, might experience a relatively high
phasic serotonin response that leads to sexual inhibition.
Conversely, women with the CC genotype might have a serotonin
system that is characterized by relatively high basal (tonic) activity,
which might be associated with a system that is less sensitive to
threatening and rewarding stimuli.
The 5 psychological variables consisted of 5 5-point Likert
scale items that assessed mental arousal and excitement, orgasmic
function, masturbation frequency, sensitivity to socio-sexual
stimuli (“I enjoy watching sexually attractive people”), and
repulsion to sexual arousal (“I am repulsed by sexual feelings”).
See the supporting information for an elaborate description of
the demarcation formula and its components.
Medication, Dosing, and Instructions
Sublingual Testosterone þ Sildenafil (T þ S)
This drug is a dual-route, dual-release, fixed-dose combination
of T and S citrate.27 The drug product is a 9-mm, round,
biconvex, white, menthol-flavored tablet for sublingual admin-
istration. The outer coating (a polymeric film) contains T (0.5
mg) that is released immediately at sublingual administration.
The inner core of the tablet, which contains S (50 mg), has a
polymeric coating designed to delay the release of that drug for
approximately 2.5 hours. When that period elapses, S is released
immediately (ie, there is no sustained release).
Sublingual Testosterone þ Buspirone (T þ B)
This drug is a dual-route, dual-release, fixed-dose combination
of T and B hydrochloride.28 The drug product is a 9-mm, round,
biconvex, white, menthol-flavored tablet for sublingual and oral
administration. The appearance, method of administration, and
flavor of T þ B are identical to those of T þ S. The outer
polymeric-film coating contains T (0.5 mg) that is released
immediately at sublingual administration. The inner core of the
tablet contains B hydrochloride (10 mg). This inner core has a
polymeric coating designed to delay the release of B for
approximately 2.5 hours. When that period elapses, B is released
immediately (ie, there is no sustained release).
The placebo tablets were identical in appearance and flavor to
the fixed-dose combination T þ S and T þ B tablets containing
the active pharmaceutical ingredients. All study medication was
manufactured
and
packaged
at
Piramal
Healthcare
UK
(Morpeth, UK).
Participants were instructed to keep the tablet under their
tongues for 90 seconds and then to swallow it whole, without
chewing it or otherwise disrupting the dosage form. They were
permitted to take the tablet with a little water. The partici-
pants were instructed to engage in sexual activity 3 to 6 hours
after ingestion. The dosing instructions were the same for all
regimes.
28 doses were provided in the 8-week treatment period. The
participants were asked to endeavor to take a minimum of 1 dose
per week. They were informed that they could take the
remaining doses as required (ie, on demand) throughout the
8-week treatment period. The minimum period between
individual doses was 2 days (ie, on alternate days).
Randomization and Masking
Participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were
randomized and allocated to a treatment sequence. The
randomization list was designed by an independent statistician at
Pharma Consulting Group (Uppsala, Sweden). Randomization
was performed using an interactive web response system (Viedoc;
Pharma Consulting Group), with a unique numeric medication
code from the randomization list being assigned to each ran-
domized subject. The corresponding medication kit (bearing the
same unique number) was sent to the site by the warehouse
where the study medication was stored (Sentry BioPharma
Services Inc, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The factors body mass
index and menopausal status (pre- or postmenopausal) were
balanced across treatment arms. A unique subject identification
code was used to ensure that the data were anonymous. Access to
the key to this identification code was restricted. An 8-week,
single-blinded PRI period was used to dampen the usual placebo
effect during active treatments. Investigators were aware that all
participants received placebo during the PRI period, but the
participants were not. The investigators and site personnel
involved were given appropriate instruction and training to
minimize potential effects of this knowledge. The blinding could
be broken only under exceptional circumstances, for example, if
the investigator believed that it was vital for the medical
management of the participant in question. In such cases,

 Outcomes and Assessments
Primary and secondary outcome variables were measured
using the validated Sexual Event Diary (SED).41 The SED is a
secure web-based diary that participants were required to com-
plete within a period of 24 hours after each sexual event. This
information was used to assess each participant’s satisfaction and
sexual functioning during that event. Participants were asked to
indicate whether the event was satisfactory and whether they
experienced an orgasm (dichotomous items). They also were
asked to indicate the associated levels of sexual desire, pleasure,
bodily arousal, and subjective arousal (using 5-point Likert scale
items). In addition, they were asked for details of the type and
duration of the sexual event in question and whether they used
the study medication before that event.
The primary end point was the change in the number of SSEs
(as recorded by the SED) in the interval from the 4-week baseline
to the 4-week mean of the 8-week ATP. This end point is one of
the FDA’s accepted primary end points for clinical trials in
HSDD and FSIAD. The following formula was used to calculate
change in the number of SSEs from baseline (DSSE) for each
participant:
DSSE ¼ ðPSSEATP1�4 þ PSSEATP5�8Þ
2
�
�X
SSEBLE1�4
�
where ATP1e4 represents ATP weeks 1 through 4, ATP5e8
represents ATP weeks 5 through 8, and BLE1e4 represents
baseline establishment at weeks 1 through 4. The key secondary
end point was the change (during the same interval) in the
cumulative level of subjective sexual satisfaction (4-item mean of
desire, pleasure, bodily arousal, and subjective arousal) during the
SSEs produced by the treatments. Another secondary end point
was the change in the number of orgasms (as recorded by the
SED) from the 4-week baseline to the 4-week mean of the
8-week ATP. The PRI period was not used in the analyses
because it was intended only to stabilize placebo responses.
Additional secondary outcome variables were assessed using
the Weekly Diary (WD). Each week, participants filled out the
WD at home using the same secure web-based platform as the
SED. The WD assessed how often participants experienced
sexual desire and arousal during the preceding week, ranging
from “not at all” to “more than a couple of times a day” on a
6-point scale. Also, subjects were asked whether the perceived
change was caused by the study medication.
For a description of the hormone and biomarker assays, see the
supporting information.
Statistical Analyses
To assess the primary end point, interaction effects were
calculated among the highest-dose combinations, the placebo
condition, and the monotherapies (S or B and T alone). This
allowed the comparison of the change in the number of SSEs
from the 4-week baseline establishment period to the 4-week
mean of the 8-week ATP. The primary end point and the
method of analysis were agreed upon with the regulatory agencies
(FDA and European Medicines Agency [EMA]). A similar
approach was used to assess the key secondary end point and the
other secondary end points. The interaction effects were derived
by using regression analyses on each imputed dataset (see
supporting information for a description of the imputation
methods). The difference between baseline and active treatment
was used as the dependent variable and the treatment group
indicator was used as the independent variable. The regression
coefficient of the treatment group indicator represents the
difference in change from baseline between the 2 treatment
groups. Regression coefficient estimates and standard errors were
combined according to Rubin’s Rules.42,43
The a value was set at 0.05 (2-sided). Statistical analyses were
performed in line with the statistical analysis plan as described in
the clinical study protocols (see supporting information; note
that the SED was formerly named SSEQ) using IBM SPSS
Statistics 21.0 for Windows (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA)
and R 3.2 (The R Project for Statistical Computing, The R
Foundation, Vienna, Austria).
The safety analysis population consisted of all those partici-
pants who received at least 1 dose of study medication.
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all safety data. All
adverse events were listed, as were the number of participants in
each treatment group involved and details of the incidence of
these events. For the incidence assessment, cases in which a single
participant experienced adverse events on more than 1 occasion
were counted as single incidents.
RESULTS
Of 1,126 women who were screened, 497 were randomized to
1 of the 12 treatment regimens. Data from 397 participants were
analyzed (CONSORT diagram, Figure 1). Baseline characteris-
tics and demographics are presented in Table 1. Baseline
hormonal values were in the normal female reproductive and/or
postmenopausal range. None of the dependent variables were
influenced by menopausal status or hormonal contraception.
Safety
Treatments with T þ S and T þ B were well tolerated. No
serious adverse events related to treatment were reported, and no
safety concerns with respect to vital signs, signs of hyper-
androgenism, or laboratory values were detected. Sublingual
T administration did not show a treatment-related increase on
endogenous T levels when comparing the start of the ATP with
follow-up (Table S4). The most common drug-related side
effects were flushing (1 participant reported this during T þ S
treatment [3%] and 1 during T þ B treatment [2%]), headache
(1 participant reported this during placebo treatment [2%] and
3 during T þ S treatment [9%]), dizziness (2 participants
reported this during T þ B treatment [3%]), and nausea
(1 participant reported this during T þ S treatment [3%] and 1
during T þ B treatment [2%]).

Primary End Point
Figure 3 (upper panel) shows the results in changes in SSEs
between baseline measurement and the T þ S treatment arms
(ie, ATP minus baseline) and between the control conditions
(placebo and T and S monotherapies) and the active treatments
(T þ S). Because the T þ S and T þ B studies were identical,
and because the samples were relatively small, with a substantial
amount of patient attrition, we chose an integrative data analysis
approach and pooled the results of placebo and T of the 2 studies
for the comparison with the responses of the different dosages of
T þ S and T þ B. Omission of an anomalous placebo arm (see
below) inflated the attrition rates. Attrition was equally distrib-
uted over the PRI period and ATP and over treatment arms.
Table 3 presents the results over the 3 trials separately (un-pooled
data).
Results are presented for the placebo, S 50 mg, T 0.5 mg, and
the 4 dose combinations of T (0.25 and 0.5 mg) þ S (25 and 50
mg) compared with the baseline measurement for each of these
conditions. The change in the number of SSEs from baseline was
significantly higher in the T 0.5 þ S 50 condition than for the
(i) placebo (difference in change [D] ¼ 1.70 SSEs, 95% CI ¼
0.57e2.84, P ¼ .004), (ii) S (D ¼ 1.95, 95% CI ¼ 0.44e3.45,
P ¼ .012), and (iii) T (D ¼ 1.69, 95% CI ¼ 0.58e2.80, P ¼
.003; Figure 3) conditions. The effect sizes (Cohen d) showed
large effects (approximately 0.7) for the comparison between the
0.5 T þ 50 S group and the placebo, S, and T groups (Table 2).
Figure 3 (lower panel) presents the results for the placebo, B
10 mg, T 0.5 mg, and the 4 dose combinations of T (0.25 and
0.5 mg) þ B (0.50 and 10 mg). There was an anomalous placebo
effect in the study investigating T þ B. Although the increase in
SSEs between baseline and ATP was statistically significant for
the highest dosage of T þ B and in the expected direction, this
effect was diluted by an enormous increase in SSEs in the placebo
condition. All analyses indicated that this observation was an
anomaly and a statistical outlier condition. See supporting in-
formation eFigure 3 and text for a description of the anomalous
result and all investigations and analyses performed. In consul-
tation with the regulatory authorities (EMA and FDA), we
conducted an additional 2-arm study comparing placebo with
the highest dose of T þ B. The results of this additional study,
which were used to replace those of the anomalous condition,
were included in the present analysis. The results for T þ B
showed that the change in the number of SSEs from baseline was
significantly higher than the values associated with the placebo
(D ¼ 0.99, 95% CI ¼ 0.17e1.82, P ¼ 0.019), B (D ¼ 1.52,
95% CI ¼ 0.57e2.46, P ¼ .002) and T (D ¼ 0.98, 95% CI ¼
0.17e1.78, P ¼ .018; Figure 3) conditions. For the effect sizes,
the comparison between the 0.5 T þ 10 B condition and the
placebo (0.47) and T (0.46) indicated medium effects. A large
effect size was found for the comparison with B (0.78; Table 2).

The change in subjective sexual satisfaction from baseline was
significantly larger in the 0.5 T þ 50 S condition compared with
the placebo (D ¼ 6.01, 95% CI ¼ 1.64e10.39, P ¼ .008),
S (D ¼ 6.35, 95% CI ¼ 0.71e12.00, P ¼ .028), and T
(D ¼ 5.75, 95% CI ¼ 1.72e9.79, P ¼ .006; Figure 4A)
conditions. The effect sizes (Cohen d) showed medium to large
effects for the comparison between the 0.5 T þ 50 S group and
the placebo (0.66), S (0.62), and T (0.67; Table 2) groups. The
change in the number of orgasms from baseline was significantly
larger in the 0.5 T þ 50 S condition compared with placebo
(D ¼ 1.10, CI ¼ 0.09e2.11, P ¼ .033; Figure 4C), with a
medium effect size of 0.53 (Table 2). Although the increase in
the number of orgasms did not show a significant difference
between 0.5 T þ 50 S and T, Cohen d showed a medium effect
in the difference in the increase in orgasms (0.41; Table 2 and
Figure 4C).
The change in subjective sexual satisfaction from baseline was
significantly larger in the 0.5 T þ 10 B condition compared with
the placebo (D ¼ 3.54, 95% CI ¼ 0.43e6.66, P ¼ .026), B
(D ¼ 5.12, 95% CI ¼ 1.62e8.63, P ¼ .005), and T (D ¼ 3.29,
95% CI ¼ 0.41e6.16, P ¼ .026; Figure 4B) conditions. The
effect sizes (Cohen d) showed medium effects for the 0.5 T þ 10
B group compared with placebo (0.44) and T (0.44) and a large
effect for the 0.5 T þ 10 B condition compared with B (0.70;

 Table 2). The change in the number of orgasms from baseline
was significantly larger in the 0.5 T þ 10 B condition compared
with placebo (D ¼ 0.78, 95% CI ¼ 0.07e1.49, P ¼ .032) and
B (D ¼ 1.09, 95% CI ¼ 0.23e1.96, P ¼ .014; Figure 4D). The

compared with placebo (0.43) and a medium to large effect for
the comparison with B (0.61; Table 2). Table 3 presents sec-
ondary end-point results over the 3 trials separately (un-pooled
data).
Figure S4 shows the analyses of the secondary end points
desire, arousal, and perceived drug-related improvement as
assessed by the WD. The 2 highest-dose combinations out-
performed the placebo condition and the monotherapies. Our
analysis also showed significant interaction effects, with medium
to large effect sizes (eTable 5).
DISCUSSION
This report describes a personalized medicine approach to
differentiate and treat 2 possible etiologies in FSIAD: women
with low sensitivity to the central processing of sexual cues vs
high levels of inhibition to such processing. This approach differs
from the traditional 1-size-fits-all approach, which assumes that a
drug works for everyone with the same complaint. However, in
general, a significant percentage of patients do not respond at all
and some respond even counterproductively. We started a
research program with the assumption that apparently different
underlying mechanisms are responsible for the same symptoms
and complaints (in our case, low sexual desire) in patients. The
present results demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach.
The highest-dose combinations of T þ S and T þ B produced
statistically significant increases in the number of SSEs and
outperformed the placebo and monotherapies over an 8-week
period for subjective sexual satisfaction. Thus, the combination
of T þ S appears to be very promising as a potential personalized,
on-demand treatment option for individuals with FSIAD who
have low sensitivity to sexual cues. The same is true of the
combination of T þ B for individuals with FSIAD resulting from
the over-activation of sexual inhibitory mechanisms. An increase
of 1 to 2 SSEs was reported to be clinically relevant in a sample of
450 pre- and postmenopausal women with self-described low
sexual desire and related distress.44 The increases reported in the
present studies range from 1 to 2 SSEs per 4 weeks. Moreover,
this number is substantially larger than the pooled mean differ-
ences for SSE change from baseline of flibanserin vs placebo,
which was 0.49.7 Therefore, it is anticipated that the increases
induced by T þ S and T þ B are clinically relevant. Treatments
with T þ S and T þ B were well tolerated, there were few
adverse events, no serious treatment-related adverse events were
reported, and there were no safety concerns with respect to vital
signs, signs of hyperandrogenism, or laboratory values.
Despite approving flibanserin for the treatment of HSDD, the
FDA has the opinion that there is still “a medical need for
development of drugs with a favorable benefit-risk profile to treat

 women with sexual dysfunction.”45 However, there has been
much discussion about the pros and cons of pharmacologic and
psychological treatments of HSDD and FSIAD. A recent review
article describing pharmacologic and psychological approaches
for the treatment of HSDD and FSIAD showed that progress has
been made on both sides.46 Psychological treatments and phar-
macologic treatments have shown promising effects, but com-
parisons between the 2 remain difficult. In psychological studies,
the end points are multidimensional (eg, quality of relationship,
self-esteem) and differ from the pharmacologic end points (eg,
SSE, sexual desire). Moreover, trials investigating psychological
treatments face methodologic challenges that pharmacologic
trials do not have (eg, the inability to blind subjects for
treatment), making them prone to bias.46 However, the 2
treatment approaches and innovative studies thereof remain vital
to our field.
A leading idea in our research is that disorders such as FSIAD
result from an interplay among biological (genetic) influences,
experiences, and current circumstances. For example, high sexual
inhibition might result from, on the one hand, the combination
of genes, hormones, and neurotransmitters that increase the
brain’s sensitivity to sexual cues (biological level) and, on the
other hand, a negative attitude toward sex, which could be
caused by different influences, such as upbringing, (first) sexual
and romantic experiences, peer relationships, and so one. A
system sensitive to sexual stimuli combined with positive sexual

 experiences can lead to a pleasant and enjoyable sexual life.
However, adverse sexual experiences can have a greater impact on
those whose brains are more sensitive to sexual cues. A combi-
nation of a highly sensitive brain and adverse experiences can lead
to a learned and automatic sexual inhibitory response in which
sexual events and adverse associations are automatically linked.
Our view reflects the possibility that biological mechanisms elicit
a sexual inhibitory response that opens the window for a phar-
macologic intervention. In this example, underlying biological
mechanisms determine the rationale for one kind of treatment in
favor of the other. However, our solution does not exclude
psychological interventions as a possible treatment option, for
example, those aimed at unlearning of negative sexual associa-
tions and to replace them with positive associations.
On the other side of the sexual sensitivity coin, if a patient has
a brain that is relatively insensitive to sexual stimuli (eg, because
of genetically or biologically determined constraints), it will be
difficult or even impossible to increase sexual desire by psycho-
logical interventions alone. That said, HSDD or FSIAD is not
the only result of a brain that is relatively insensitive to sexual
stimuli. Experiences and circumstances are just as important or
might even be decisive. A person with a relatively insensitive
brain for sexual stimuli could have fewer sexual problems than
someone in the same circumstances who, because of a genetic
fate, has a more sensitive system. For HSDD or FSIAD, psy-
chological interventions can help to accept these nature-given
boundaries or to learn to be sexually satisfied within the
context of lower level of sexual excitability.
We encourage investigating pharmacologic and psychological
approaches, or combinations thereof, from a personalized
perspective of this disorder, which has been described in the
literature in one form or other for at least 100 years.47 For the
moment, we argue that the on-demand treatments discussed in
this study clearly benefit 2 differentiated subgroups of women
with FSIAD.
Strengths and Limitations
The data were collected in 3 well-designed randomized clinical
trials that tested multiple doses in a substantial number of
women. However, there are a number of limitations that deserve
discussion.
Safety issues associated with the use of T in the treatment of
sexual dysfunctions, particularly in women, have generated a
great deal of debate. Most studies on the influence of T on fe-
male sexual behavior involve the regular administration of T (as
does hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women).48e50
The regular administration of T and associated steady-state
plasma levels have been associated with significant safety con-
cerns. In contrast, on-demand sublingual T causes a steep in-
crease in total and free T levels, which then return to baseline
within approximately 2 hours.18,19 Thus, the safe, convenient,
and well-tolerated sublingual dosing of T does not result in a
sustained increase in T levels, which decreases untoward adverse
events. Furthermore, it is unlikely that increasing the dose of T
in T þ S or T þ B would increase their efficacy. The increase in
the free fraction of T has been hypothesized to underlie the in-
fluence of sublingual T on sexual stimulus sensitivity. Investi-
gating 3 doses of sublingual T showed that the free fraction does
not differ between doses of 0.5 and 0.75 mg but does differ
between 0.25 and 0.5 mg.19
Increasing the doses of S in T þ S or B in T þ B could have a
beneficial influence on sexual functioning in the respective
subgroups. However, it is also likely that higher doses would
increase the frequency and severity of adverse events related to
these doses, so there would be a tradeoff with efficacy on the one
hand and safety on the other, with the latter potentially inhib-
iting the former. We currently believe this is the optimal dose
combination for this population.
Another important aspect of FSIAD that needs to be assessed
is the distress experienced by patients. The finding that the 2
combination products have more robust effects on measurements
of individual sexual events than they do on regular weekly
measurements reflects the intrinsic on-demand nature of these
products. Producing increased satisfaction in response to indi-
vidual sexual events during a relatively short period of treatment
has no direct effect on a patient’s level of distress. Such distress
can be expected to wane after a more protracted series of SSEs.
The primary focus of our phase 3 program involves changes in
distress coupled with changes in SSEs. It also should be noted
that the beneficial sexual effects of on-demand medications are
expected to produce a sustained improvement in psychological
and social well-being, and it was a limitation of the present trial
that we could not test this. Also, the number of subjects per arm
was relatively small. This led to some analyses not being statis-
tically significant, although the effect sizes were substantial.
The trials were designed in accordance with regulatory guid-
ance. The single-blinded PRI periods were incorporated solely to
decrease the placebo effect over time by habituation and thus
increase the power of the study. Decreasing the participants’
placebo responses over time makes their subsequent responses to
an active treatment more valid and produces lower placebo
comparator responses during the ATP. Phase 3 trials will not
make use of the PRI period to mimic actual clinical practice, and
by applying longer treatment periods and larger samples potential
power issues will be circumvented.
The demarcation formula that was used to differentiate the 2
FSIAD subgroups appears to be valid because of the positive
effects T þ S and T þ B had on women with low sensitivity and
those with and high inhibition, respectively. However, these
studies were not designed to test the efficacy of the drugs in the
expected non-responder groups, so these data cannot definitively
answer that question. However, previous studies have shown that
women with low sensitivity do not or only minimally respond to
T þ B and that women with high inhibition do not or only
minimally respond to T þ S,16,17 so it is to be expected that the
formula is valid.

Efficacy and Safety of On-Demand Treatment for FSIAD

 CONCLUSIONS
The focus of the present program was to improve sexual func-
tioning and satisfaction during sexual events. This involved the use
of a personalized medicine approach to develop separate treatments
for the identified patient subtypes. We have developed study
medication that specifically targets underlying central and pe-
ripheral mechanisms. For these separate combination therapies to
be most effective, we have applied a demarcation formula to a
combination of biological and psychological variables to allocate
individuals to distinct FSIAD subtypes. This personalized treat-
ment method has proved to be successful and is very promising not
only for the treatment of FSIAD but also for further investigation
of novel approaches to personalized medicine in general.
