BACKGROUND
The inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) could potentially over-
come or delay resistance to endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer that is 
positive for hormone receptor (HR) and negative for human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2).
METHODS
In this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we evaluated the efficacy and 
safety of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib combined with letrozole for first-
line treatment in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative re-
current or metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous systemic therapy 
for advanced disease. We randomly assigned the patients to receive either ribociclib 
(600 mg per day on a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-off schedule) plus letrozole (2.5 mg per 
day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was investigator-assessed 
progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, overall 
response rate, and safety. A preplanned interim analysis was performed on January 
29, 2016, after 243 patients had disease progression or died. Prespecified criteria 
for superiority required a hazard ratio of 0.56 or less with P<1.29×10−5.
RESULTS
The duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ribociclib 
group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.72; P=3.29×10−6 
for superiority). The median duration of follow-up was 15.3 months. After 18 months, 
the progression-free survival rate was 63.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6 to 
70.3) in the ribociclib group and 42.2% (95% CI, 34.8 to 49.5) in the placebo group. 
In patients with measurable disease at baseline, the overall response rate was 
52.7% and 37.1%, respectively (P<0.001). Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events that 
were reported in more than 10% of the patients in either group were neutropenia 
(59.3% in the ribociclib group vs. 0.9% in the placebo group) and leukopenia (21.0% 
vs. 0.6%); the rates of discontinuation because of adverse events were 7.5% and 2.1%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients receiving initial systemic treatment for HR-positive, HER2-negative 
advanced breast cancer, the duration of progression-free survival was significantly 
longer among those receiving ribociclib plus letrozole than among those receiving 
placebo plus letrozole, with a higher rate of myelosuppression in the ribociclib group.

U
p to 75% of breast cancers express 
the estrogen receptor or progesterone 
receptor (hormone-receptor [HR]–posi-
tive).1,2 Endocrine therapy is the standard of care 
for postmenopausal women with advanced breast 
cancer that is HR-positive and human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative, with 
aromatase inhibitors being the preferred first-line 
treatment option.3,4 However, in the majority of 
patients, resistance to currently available options 
eventually develops, which requires the adminis-
tration of sequential therapy with alternative en-
docrine regimens.4-8 Thus, the identification of 
effective treatment options that prolong or restore 
sensitivity to endocrine therapies is important.
Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) in 
conjunction with their protein regulator, cyclin 
D1 (encoded by CCND1), a direct transcriptional 
target of estrogen-receptor signaling, regulate 
cell-cycle progression.9 CDK4/6 overexpression 
and CCND1 amplification are frequently encoun-
tered in HR-positive breast cancers10 and are key 
mediators of endocrine resistance.11 The inhibi-
tion of the pathway consisting of cyclin D, CDK4/6, 
inhibitor of CDK4 (INK4), and retinoblastoma 
protein is an effective therapeutic strategy for 
HR-positive advanced breast cancer, both as a first-
line option12,13 and in patients in whom disease has 
progressed while they were receiving endocrine 
therapy.14,15
Ribociclib (LEE011) is an orally bioavailable, 
selective, small-molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 that 
blocks the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma pro-
tein, thereby preventing cell-cycle progression 
and inducing G1 phase arrest.16 Ribociclib has 
previously been shown to have antitumor activity 
in xenograft models of estrogen-receptor–posi-
tive breast cancer as a single agent and in com-
bination with letrozole and phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors.17 In a phase 1b study 
involving postmenopausal women with estrogen-
receptor–positive, HER2-negative advanced breast 
cancer, ribociclib had an acceptable safety pro-
file and showed signs of clinical activity in com-
bination with letrozole, particularly in patients 
who had received no previous systemic treatment 
for advanced disease, with an overall response rate 
of 46% and a clinical benefit rate of 79% among 
patients with measurable disease.18
Here, we present the results of the preplanned 
interim analysis of the Mammary Oncology As-
sessment of LEE011’s (Ribociclib’s) Efficacy and 
Safety (MONALEESA-2) trial, which evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of the combination of riboci-
clib and letrozole as initial therapy in patients 
with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast 
cancer.
Methods
Study Design
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, phase 3 trial conducted in 29 countries, 
patients at 223 trial centers were randomly as-
signed to receive either oral ribociclib (600 mg 
per day on a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-off schedule in 
28-day treatment cycles) plus letrozole (2.5 mg per 
day on a continuous schedule) or placebo plus le-
trozole. We selected the ribociclib dose of 600 mg 
per day on the basis of the results of a phase 1 
study involving patients with advanced cancer.19 
Ribociclib was administered with or without food.20 
Randomization was stratified according to the 
presence or absence of liver or lung metastases. 
Patients received treatment until disease progres-
sion, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinua-
tion of ribociclib or letrozole for any other reason. 
Dose reductions for ribociclib (from 600 mg to 
400 mg to 200 mg per day) were permitted to 
manage treatment-related adverse events; no dose 
reductions were allowed for letrozole. Patients 
who discontinued either ribociclib or placebo were 
permitted to continue receiving letrozole. No treat-
ment crossover was allowed.
Patients
Postmenopausal women with locally confirmed, 
HR-positive, HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic 
breast cancer who had not received previous sys-
temic therapy for advanced disease were eligible. 
Patients had either measurable disease (accord-
ing to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tu-
mors [RECIST], version 1.1)21 or at least one pre-
dominantly lytic bone lesion, along with an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status22 
of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale on which a higher 
score indicates greater disability) and adequate 
bone marrow and organ function.
Patients were excluded if they had received a 
previous CDK4/6 inhibitor or any previous sys-
temic chemotherapy or endocrine therapy for ad-
vanced disease. Previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor 
was not allowed, unless the disease-free interval

Ribociclib in HR-Positive, Advanced Breast Cancer
was more than 12 months. Also excluded were 
patients with inflammatory breast cancer, central 
nervous system metastases, a history of cardiac 
disease or dysfunction (including a QT interval 
corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’s 
formula [QTcF] of >450 msec at screening), or 
impaired gastrointestinal function that altered 
drug absorption. The use of concomitant medi-
cations with a known risk of prolonging the QT 
interval or inducing torsades de pointes was not 
permitted.
End Points
The primary end point was locally assessed pro-
gression-free survival, according to RECIST, ver-
sion 1.1. The key secondary end point was over-
all survival. Other secondary end points included 
the overall response rate (complete or partial re-
sponse), the clinical benefit rate (overall response 
plus stable disease lasting 24 weeks or more), 
safety, and quality-of-life assessments. Exploratory 
end points included pharmacokinetics and bio-
markers of response or resistance. The results of 
quality-of-life assessments and exploratory analy-
ses are not reported here.
Assessments
Tumor assessments (computed tomography or 
magnetic resonance imaging) were performed 
at screening, every 8 weeks during the first 
 
18 months, every 12 weeks thereafter until dis-
ease progression (including in patients who dis-
continued treatment for reasons other than pro-
gressive disease), and at the end of treatment. An 
independent review committee whose members 
were unaware of treatment assignments pro-
spectively reviewed all imaging data.
Adverse events were characterized and graded 
throughout the study according to National Can-
cer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, version 4.03.23 Biochemical and 
hematologic laboratory tests were performed at 
screening, on day 15 of cycle 1, and on day 1 of 
subsequent cycles until the end of treatment. 
Electrocardiographic assessments were performed 
at screening, on day 15 of cycle 1, and on day 1 
of cycles 2 and 3 in all patients; after a protocol 
amendment, additional electrocardiographic as-
sessments were performed on day 1 of cycles 4 
through 9 in all patients and on day 1 of subse-
quent cycles in patients with a mean QTcF inter-
val of 481 msec or more at any time before cycle 
10. On-study electrocardiograms were reviewed 
by a central panel in a blinded fashion.
Representative tumor samples (obtained on 
fresh biopsy or from archival tissue) were obtained 
for biomarker analyses when available at screen-
ing, with an optional tumor sample collected at 
the time of disease progression. Blood samples 
were collected for analysis of estradiol levels and 
molecular alterations in circulating tumor DNA.
Study Oversight
The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan 
are available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. Any modifications were approved by 
an independent ethics committee and institutional 
review board at each site. A steering committee 
oversaw the conduct of the trial in conformation 
with the approved protocol. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all the patients.
The trial was conducted in accordance with 
the Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the pro-
visions of the Declaration of Helsinki. An indepen-
dent data and safety monitoring committee re-
viewed 
the 
efficacy 
and 
safety 
data. 
Representatives 
of the trial sponsor, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 
collected and analyzed the data. All the authors 
had full access to the data, were involved in the 
development and approval of the manuscript, 
and had final responsibility for the decision to 
submit the manuscript for publication. The man-
uscript was prepared by the authors with assis-
tance from a medical writer funded by the sponsor. 
The authors assume responsibility for the accuracy 
and completeness of the data and vouch for the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
Statistical Analysis
For the primary efficacy analysis, we compared 
progression-free survival in the two groups using 
a log-rank test stratified according to the presence 
or absence of liver or lung metastases. A determi-
nation that 302 patients had disease progression 
or died was required to detect a hazard ratio of 
0.67 with a power of 93.5% at a one-sided alpha 
level of 0.025 with the use of a two-look Haybit-
tle–Peto efficacy stopping boundary.24,25 A strati-
fied Cox regression analysis was performed to 
estimate the hazard ratio and 95% confidence 
intervals of progression-free survival.
A prespecified interim analysis was planned 
after disease progression or death was reported 
in 211 of 302 patients (70%). The superiority of

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
ribociclib plus letrozole versus placebo plus letro-
zole would be defined as a hazard ratio of 0.56 or 
less with P<1.29×10−5.
Efficacy analyses were performed in the inten-
tion-to-treat population. Safety analyses were per-
formed in patients who received at least one dose 
of a study regimen and had at least one safety 
assessment after baseline.
Results
Patient Characteristics
From January 24, 2014, to March 24, 2015, a total 
of 668 patients underwent randomization, with 
334 assigned to receive ribociclib plus letrozole 
and 334 assigned to receive placebo plus letro-
zole (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org). The characteristics of the 
patients at baseline were well balanced between 
the two groups (Table 1). The median age was 
62 years; all the patients had HR-positive disease, 
and all but 1 patient in each group had HER2-
negative disease. A total of 227 patients (34.0%) 
had newly diagnosed advanced or metastatic dis-
ease (34.1% in the ribociclib group and 33.8% in 
the placebo group). The disease-free interval at 
baseline was more than 24 months in 397 patients 
(59.4%). Visceral disease (including liver, lung, and 
other visceral metastases) was present in 393 pa-
tients (58.8%), and 147 (22.0%) had bone-only 
disease.
Treatment
At the cutoff date (January 29, 2016), treatment 
was still being administered in 195 patients in 
the ribociclib group and in 154 in the placebo 
group. The median duration of exposure to treat-
ment (i.e., from the first dose to the last does of 
either ribociclib or placebo) was 13.0 months and 
12.4 months, respectively. The most common rea-
sons for discontinuation were progressive disease 
in 87 patients (26.0%) in the ribociclib group and 
in 146 (43.7%) in the placebo group; a decision by 
the patient or physician in 22 (6.6%) and in 26 
(7.8%), respectively; and adverse events in 25 (7.5%) 
and 7 (2.1%), respectively. The median duration of 
follow-up from randomization to data cutoff was 
15.3 months. The median relative dose intensity 
was 100% for letrozole in the two groups, 100% 
for placebo, and 87.5% for ribociclib. Interrup-
tions in the dose of ribociclib occurred in 257 
patients (76.9%), and letrozole was interrupted 
in 132 patients (39.5%) in the ribociclib group. 
Among the 330 patients in the placebo safety 
population, placebo was interrupted in 134 (40.6%), 
and letrozole was interrupted in 107 (32.4%). Dose 
reductions occurred in 53.9% of the patients in the 
ribociclib group and in 7.0% of those in the pla-
cebo group, most commonly for adverse events 
(in 169 patients [50.6%] and 14 [4.2%], respective-
ly). The most frequent adverse event leading to 
dose reduction was neutropenia (in 104 patients 
receiving ribociclib and in no patients receiving 
placebo).
Efficacy of Ribociclib plus Letrozole
The interim analysis was triggered after at least 
211 patients had disease progression or died. 
Because of a delay in reporting from local trial 
centers, at the time of the data cutoff, 243 pa-
tients had disease progression or died and were 
included in the interim analysis. The trial met its 
primary end point: the median duration of pro-
gression-free survival was not reached in the ri-
bociclib group (95% CI, 19.3 to not reached) 
versus 14.7 months (95% CI, 13.0 to 16.5) in the 
placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43 
to 0.72; P = 3.29×10−6 for superiority) (Fig. 1). 
The rate of locally assessed progression-free sur-
vival was significantly higher in the ribociclib 
group than in the placebo group. After 12 months, 
the progression-free survival rate was 72.8% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 67.3 to 77.6) in 
the ribociclib group and 60.9% (95% CI, 55.1 to 
66.2) in the placebo group; after 18 months, the 
progression-free survival rate was 63.0% (95% 
CI, 54.6 to 70.3) and 42.2% (95% CI, 34.8 to 
49.5), respectively.
The blinded central analysis of progression-
free survival by an independent review commit-
tee supported the results of the primary efficacy 
analysis, with a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 
0.41 to 0.85; P 
= 
0.002). The progression-free sur-
vival benefit in the ribociclib group (as assessed 
by investigators) was observed across all pre-
defined subgroups (Fig. 2). The overall response 
rates were 40.7% in the ribociclib group and 
27.5% in the placebo group in the intention-to-
treat population and 52.7% and 37.1%, respec-
tively, among patients with measurable disease 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Table 2). The 
clinical benefit rates were 79.6% in the ribociclib 
group and 72.8% in the placebo group in the 
intention-to-treat population and 80.1% and 71.8%, 
respectively, among patients with measurable 
disease (P 
= 
0.02 for both comparisons).

Overall survival results were not mature at the 
time of the interim analysis, with 43 deaths (23 in 
the ribociclib group and 20 in the placebo group) 
at the time of data cutoff. The study remains 
blinded for follow-up of overall survival.
Safety
In the safety population (334 patients in the ri-
bociclib group and 330 in the placebo group), 
adverse events of any grade that occurred in at 
least 35% of the patients in either group were 
neutropenia (74.3% in the ribociclib group and 
5.2% in the placebo group), nausea (51.5% and 
28.5%, respectively), infections (50.3% and 42.4%), 
fatigue (36.5% and 30.0%), and diarrhea (35.0% 
and 22.1%) (Table 3). Nausea, infections, fatigue, 
and diarrhea were mostly grade 1 or 2. The most 
common grade 3 or 4 adverse events (≥5% of the 
patients in either group) were neutropenia (59.3% 
in the ribociclib group and 0.9% in the placebo 
group), leukopenia (21.0% and 0.6%, respectively), 
hypertension (9.9% and 10.9%), increased alanine 
aminotransferase level (9.3% and 1.2%), lympho-
penia (6.9% and 0.9%), and increased aspartate 
aminotransferase level (5.7% and 1.2%). Febrile 
neutropenia occurred in 5 patients (1.5%) in the 
ribociclib group and in none in the placebo 
group.
Four patients (1.2%) in the ribociclib group 
were confirmed as having met the biochemical 
definition of Hy’s law (concomitant increases in 
aminotransferase and bilirubin levels in the ab-
sence of cholestasis). Three of the four cases in 
the ribociclib group were suspected by the inves-
tigator to be related to the study treatment. 
None of these cases resulted in death, and ami-
notransferase and bilirubin levels returned to 
normal in all four patients after the discontinu-
ation of ribociclib.
Infections were reported in 168 patients (50.3%) 
in the ribociclib group and in 140 (42.4%) in the 
placebo group; of these infections, the most com-
mon were urinary tract infections (10.8% and 
8.2%, respectively) and upper respiratory tract 
infections (10.5% and 10.6%), predominantly of 
grade 1 or 2. The only grade 3 infections were 
reported in the ribociclib group, with grade 3 
urinary tract infection in 2 patients (0.6%); there 
were no grade 4 infections in either group.
An increase of more than 60 msec from base-
line in the QTcF interval occurred in 9 patients 
(2.7%) in the ribociclib group and in no patients 
in the placebo group. In the ribociclib group, 11 
patients (3.3%) had at least one average QTcF 
interval of more than 480 msec after baseline, 
including 1 patient who presented with cardiac 
abnormalities at baseline and 6 who had an in-
crease of more than 60 msec from baseline. Of 
these patients, most were able to continue treat-
ment at the 600-mg dose of ribociclib without 
interruption. One patient (0.3%) in the placebo 
group had an average post-baseline QTcF inter-
val of more than 480 msec.
Serious adverse events occurred in 71 patients 
(21.3%) in the ribociclib group and in 39 (11.8%) 
in the placebo group (Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Of these events, 25 (7.5%) in 
the ribociclib group and 5 (1.5%) in the placebo 
group were deemed to be related to the study 
regimen. There were 4 deaths (3 [0.9%] in the ri-
bociclib group and 1 (0.3%) in the placebo group) 
during treatment. One patient in each group 
died from the progression of underlying breast 
cancer. The remaining 2 deaths in the ribociclib 
group were due to sudden death and death from 
an unknown cause. The case of sudden death 
was considered to be related to ribociclib and 
occurred on day 11 in cycle 2 in association with 
grade 3 hypokalemia (treated with oral potassi-
um supplements) and a grade 2 prolongation in 
the QTcF interval on day 1 of cycle 2; the patient

placebo group. The median duration of progression-free survival was not 
reached in the ribociclib group and was 14.7 months in the placebo group.

Ribociclib in HR-Positive, Advanced Breast Cancer
had taken a prohibited concomitant medication 
with a known risk for QT prolongation (metha-
done) during cycle 1. The patient who died from 
an unknown cause received ribociclib for 4 days 
before withdrawing consent and discontinuing 
the study treatment; her death was reported 19 
days later and was not considered to be related 
to ribociclib by the investigator.
Discussion
At the prospectively planned interim analysis, we 
found that postmenopausal women with HR-posi-
tive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who 
were receiving first-line treatment with ribociclib 
plus letrozole had a significantly longer duration 
of progression-free survival than did those re-
ceiving placebo plus letrozole, with a 44% lower 
relative risk of progression. The trial population 
included a high proportion of patients who had 
disease that was expected to be sensitive to en-
docrine therapy (i.e., those with newly diagnosed 
advanced breast cancer or with a disease-free in-
terval of >24 months). However, the duration of 
progression-free survival was longer in all pre-
planned patient subgroups receiving ribociclib, 
including those with newly diagnosed or pretreat-
ed metastatic disease and those with or without 
Figure 2. Subgroup Analysis of Progression-free Survival.
The progression-free survival benefit in the ribociclib group (as assessed by investigators) was observed across all 
predefined subgroups (overall hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.72; P<3.29×10−6 for superiority) (dashed line). 
Among the patients who had received previous endocrine therapy, those taking nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors 
(NSAIs) or other therapies not listed here had not received tamoxifen. Previous endocrine therapy and chemothera-
py include neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment. The size of the data points is proportional to the number of pa-
tients included in the subgroup analysis. ECOG denotes Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.

subgroups are ongoing. Ribociclib plus letrozole 
was also associated with significantly higher rates 
of overall response and clinical benefit than was 
placebo plus letrozole, a finding that was consis-
tent with observations from an earlier phase 1 
trial.18
Most patients had an acceptable adverse-event 
profile with long-term administration of ribociclib 
plus letrozole, with 7.5% of patients requiring 
permanent discontinuation of both ribociclib and 
letrozole because of adverse events and similar

Ribociclib in HR-Positive, Advanced Breast Cancer
jority of nonhematologic adverse events in the ri-
bociclib group were of grade 1 or 2, and grade 3 
or 4 events were reversible by dose interruptions 
and reductions, which allowed most patients to 
remain on treatment. Hematologic adverse events 
in the ribociclib group reflected on-target CDK4/6 
inhibition, which resulted in reversible bone mar-
row stem-cell quiescence.26 Neutropenia occurred 
mainly within the first 4 weeks of treatment and 
resulted in five cases (1.5%) of febrile neutrope-
nia in the ribociclib group. Grade 3 or 4 elevations 
in alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels 
were reported in 9.3% and 5.7%, respectively, of 
patients receiving ribociclib in this study and have 
also been observed with other CDK4/6 inhibitors 
in combination with aromatase inhibitors.27-29 
The majority of cases of liver-enzyme elevation 
were isolated and asymptomatic and were revers-
ible with dose adjustment. Prolongation of the 
QTcF interval to more than 480 msec occurred in 
3.3% of patients treated at the 600-mg dose of 
ribociclib, with changes mostly occurring within 
the first 4 weeks of treatment. Our protocol ex-
cluded patients who were deemed to be at high 
risk for prolongation of the QTc interval; during 
treatment, such prolongation was limited by pro-
active dose interruption or reduction, since this 
side effect is dose-dependent. In routine practice,

careful monitoring should be implemented to 
limit the incidence of these events to the levels 
observed during this study.
In conclusion, this phase 3 trial showed sig-
nificant prolongation of progression-free survival 
and higher rates of overall response with the ad-
dition of ribociclib to letrozole than with the ad-
dition of placebo to letrozole for first-line treat-
ment in postmenopausal women with HR-positive, 
HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The im-
provement in the duration of progression-free 
survival was associated with a higher rate of 
myelosuppression among patients in the riboci-
clib group.
