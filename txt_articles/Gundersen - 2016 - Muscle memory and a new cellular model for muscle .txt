 REVIEW
Muscle memory and a new cellular model for muscle atrophy and
hypertrophy
Kristian Gundersen*
ABSTRACT
Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and
retrieved. For vertebrates, the modern view has been that it occurs
only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in skeletal
muscle in which hypertrophy is ‘remembered’ such that a fibre that
has previously been large, but subsequently lost its mass, can regain
mass faster than naive fibres. A new cell biological model based on
the literature, with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei,
can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously
untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before
hypertrophic growth. Even if subsequently subjected to grave atrophy,
the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem
to be protected against the elevated apoptotic activity observed in
atrophying muscle tissue. Fibres that have acquired a higher number
of myonuclei grow faster when subjected to overload exercise, thus
the nuclei represent a functionally important ‘memory’ of previous
strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as
myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be
permanent. However, myonuclei are harder to recruit in the elderly,
and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one
should consider early strength training as a public health advice. In
addition, myonuclei are recruited during steroid use and encode a
muscle memory, at least in rodents. Thus, extending the exclusion
time for doping offenders should be considered.

Introduction
A memory process entails encoding, storing and retrieving
information. For vertebrates, the modern view has been that this
process only occurs in the brain, where it is probably related to long-
lasting changes in synaptic efficiency. There has been a notion that
other organs or the body as a whole might also have a form of ‘body
memory’. For example, in popular culture it has been envisioned that
transplanted organs might confer some form of personality transfer.
The concept has also been used in more serious psychological
literature on child abuse, where the bodies of the victims supposedly
remember the traumatic incidence (Koch et al., 2012). It has been
unclear whether the term is used literally or metaphorically, but in
any case, the notion has been largely discredited and body memory
has been considered to be a pseudoscientific concept (Smith, 1993).
More credible is the use of the term memory in the immune
system to describe the fact that on the second encounter of an
antigen, the immune response is stronger and more rapid. This
memory is stored in memory immune cells; for example, memory T
cells exposed to a specific antigen have a different molecular
makeup compared with naive T cells (Mackay, 1999).
The term cell memory has also been used to describe irreversible
programming of cells such as stem cells, and is attributed to
epigenetic mechanisms such as histone and DNA modifications
other than changes in base sequence (e.g. Alvarez and Margulies,
2014; Li and Zhang, 2014). For example, it has been demonstrated
that fibroblasts in culture maintain a specific gene expression pattern
depending on where in the body they are taken from, and this has
been dubbed a positional memory (Chang et al., 2002). The more
traditional term for such phenomena is cell differentiation.
Although some forms of cell differentiation might fill the formal
criteria for memory as defined in the first paragraph above, perhaps
the term should be reserved for latent, lasting, adaptive changes that
are caused by environmental factors.
In relation to skeletal muscle, René Descartes (1596-1650) wrote:
‘The lute players have part of their memory in their hands, because
the facility to move and bend their fingers in various ways which they
have acquired by habit, helps them to remember passages that require
them to move their fingers in a way in order to play them’ (Koch et al.,
2012). In this statement, Descartes seems to believe that there is a
memory in the fingers themselves, and such ideas have probably led
to the term muscle memory. Used this way, it is an unfortunate term,
because our current understanding is that learning to play the lute and
similar tasks is a form of motor learning in the central nervous system
(CNS), and not the muscles. Thus, what has scientifically been called
muscle memory so far is really synonymous to motor learning. Motor
learning has been treated in a recent review (Diedrichsen and
Kornysheva, 2015) and is outside the scope of this paper.
The term muscle memory has also been used for the ability to
rebuild muscle mass and strength, as previous strength exercise seems
to make it easier to regain muscle mass later in life even after long
intervening periods of inactivity and mass loss (Staron et al., 1991;
Taaffe and Marcus, 1997). This phenomenon has hereto, however,
also been solely attributed to motor learning in the CNS (Rutherford
and Jones, 1986). There is clearly a CNS component to the muscle
memory of strength training, as the increase in force may precede the
increase in muscle mass, possibly by altering spinal motor neuron
excitability, and induce synaptogenesis within the spinal cord (Adkins
et al., 2006). For strength, however, the build-up of muscle protein is
crucial, and a purely neural mechanism has not seemed satisfactory.
Results from recent experiments suggest that there is a form of
cellular memory in the muscle cells themselves explaining the
phenomenon that muscle mass previously obtained is easily
regained, and that the cellular mechanism for this ‘memory’ is
related to the number of myonuclei (Bruusgaard et al., 2010; Egner
et al., 2013; Gundersen, 2011).
The largest cells of the body
Muscle cells are peculiar in being by far the largest cells of the
mammalian body. In mice, limb muscle fibres have a typical volume

 of 5 nl (Utvik et al., 1999). In larger mammals, volumes can be
much higher; e.g. a cylinder with a diameter of 50 µm and a length
of 0.5 m has a volume of ∼103 nl (Bruusgaard et al., 2003). Most
other mammalian cells are more spherical, with diameters in the
range of 5–20 µm and volumes ranging from 10−5 to 10−3 nl, i.e.
many orders of magnitude smaller than a muscle fibre. The muscle
cells have multiple nuclei, however, and constitute one of the few
syncytia in the mammalian body.
It has been suggested since the 19th century that a nucleus can serve
onlyacertain volume ofcytoplasm (e.g.Strassburger,1893),and itwas
recently argued that the link between DNA content and cell volume is a
fundamental principle in biology (Gregory, 2001). In muscle it is
believed that each nucleus serves a certain domain, and it has been
shown that some proteins are localized to the site of expression both
in vitro (Hall and Ralston, 1989; Pavlath et al., 1989; Ralston and Hall,
1992) and in vivo (Gundersen et al., 1993; Merlie and Sanes, 1985;
Sanes et al., 1991). Each nucleus is surrounded by a synthetic
machinery that seems to remain localized (Pavlath et al., 1989).
In its strictest version, this nuclear domain theory has implied that
a nucleus supports a constant volume of cytoplasm. We have studied
the naturally occurring range of fibre sizes of limb muscles of the
mouse using in vivo imaging. In the slow/oxidative soleus muscle of
young adult animals (2 months), the strict nuclear domain theory
was largely confirmed as the number of nuclei was reasonably
proportional to the cytoplasmic volume, but in the fast/glycolytic
extensor digitorum longus, the number of nuclei varied proportional
to fibre surface, and thus large fibres had systematically larger
cytoplasmic volume domains than smaller fibres (Bruusgaard et al.,
2003). Similarly, various degrees of correlation between fibre size
and number of myonuclei have been found in fixed and isolated
fibres from young animals (Brack et al., 2005; Mantilla et al., 2008;
Wada et al., 2003).
Notably, the common observation that there is at least some
correlation between size and number of nuclei is not universal.
Thus, in older mice (14–18 months) there was no correlation
between fibre size and the number of nuclei, in spite of a fourfold
variability in size (Bruusgaard et al., 2006; Wada et al., 2003). We
speculate that the number of nuclei displayed in these older mice
reflects not only the acute size of the fibre, but also its history, as a
form of memory.
The syncytial nature of muscle fibres might be related to the lack
of a long-distance transport system for proteins within these large
cells. Thus, the myonuclei are optimally positioned as to minimize
transport distances within each fibre (Bruusgaard et al., 2003,
2006), and perturbation in the positioning of nuclei leads to
impaired muscle function (Metzger et al., 2012).
The syncytial nature and the correlation between nucleic number
and cell volume, observed at least under some circumstances, suggest
that there is a rate-limiting step related to each nucleus’ capacity for
protein synthesis. In particular, during hypertrophic growth it does
not seem plausible that, for example, one nucleus could provide all
the RNA required to support the vast cytoplasmic volume of muscle
fibres, but the nature of the bottleneck is not known.
Interestingly, it was recently suggested that ribosome biogenesis
plays a central role during muscle hypertrophy (Chaillou et al.,
2014). For example, the 47S pre rRNA transcribed by Pol I is
increased during overload hypertrophy (von Walden et al., 2012).
rRNA accounts for 70% of all transcription, and most steps in the
assembly of the ribosomal subunits take place in the nucleolus,
where rRNAs are transcribed as large precursors, which undergo
extensive nucleotide modification. In addition, more than 200
non-ribosomal, resident nucleolar proteins are required to process
and modify the rRNAs and to aid their assembly with the ∼80
ribosomal proteins (Granneman and Tollervey, 2007). These
processes
require
efficient
trafficking
across
the
nuclear
membrane. In growing yeast, each nuclear pore is believed to
import 1000 ribosomal protein molecules per minute, and export
∼25 ribosomal subunits per minute (Warner, 1999). Although the
numbers are probably less dramatic in mammalian cells, such high-
throughput processes in the nucleus provide many good candidates
for steps that might be limiting hypertrophic growth and act as a
bottleneck if the number of nuclei is not sufficiently high.
The textbook model for muscle size regulation
Changes in muscle fibre size are accomplished by altering the
balance between protein synthesis and proteolysis (Fig. 1). The
molecular signalling mechanisms regulating these processes have
been the subject of several recent reviews (e.g. Cohen et al., 2015;
Egerman and Glass, 2014; Gundersen, 2011; Schiaffino et al.,
2013), and the focus has mainly been on regulating protein
degradation and synthesis per nucleus.
A corollary to the idea of constant myonuclear domains is that the
number of nuclei should change in proportion to size during atrophy
and hypertrophy. This is reflected in the current textbook model for
the regulation of muscle mass, which is illustrated in Fig. 2. The
model implies that during hypertrophic growth, myonuclei are
recruited from muscle stem cells residing inside the fibre basal
lamina (hence called satellite cells), resulting in a large fibre with
many myonuclei. The higher number of nuclei should contribute to
the increase in protein synthesis because total protein synthesis is the
product of synthesis per nucleus and the number of nuclei (Fig. 1).
During atrophy, the model suggests that myonuclei are eliminated
by apoptosis (Fig. 2). This would have to be a selective nuclear
apoptosis of some of the nuclei within the intact muscle fibre.
Notably, according to this model, a fibre undergoing hypertrophic
growth, e.g. during strength exercise, and then returning to initial
size will appear identical to a fibre that had never undergone growth.
It ends up where it started, as a small fibre with few nuclei. There is
no apparent hysteresis or memory according to this model.
However, both the ascending and the descending limbs of the
model have now become controversial.

 The controversies
Is recruitment of myonuclei obligatory for hypertrophy?
It seems generally accepted that myonuclei are added under many
hypertrophic conditions (Allen et al., 1995, 1999; Bruusgaard et al.,
2010; Cabric et al., 1987; Cabric and James, 1983; Cheek et al.,
1971; Enesco and Puddy, 1964; Giddings and Gonyea, 1992; Kadi
et al., 1999; Lipton and Schultz, 1979; McCall et al., 1998; Moss,
1968; Moss and Leblond, 1970; Roy et al., 1999; Schiaffino et al.,
1976; Seiden, 1976; Winchester and Gonyea, 1992). However, the
growth differs from the model shown in Fig. 2 in that the increase in
number of myonuclei precedes the radial growth rather than lagging
it, as has been demonstrated both with 3H-thymidine labelling
(Aloisi et al., 1973) and in vivo imaging (Bruusgaard et al., 2010).
Thus, the myonuclear domain is temporarily decreased during the
growth phase.
Although thistime course might suggest that the increasednumber
of myonuclei is causally related to the build-up of muscle mass, it has
been debated whether the addition of myonuclei is obligatory for
hypertrophic growth. According to literature from the early 1990s
and onwards, hypertrophy is abolished or attenuated when satellite
cells are ablated by X-ray irradiation (Adams et al., 2002; Barton-
Davis et al., 1999; Phelan and Gonyea, 1997; Rosenblatt and Parry,
1992; Rosenblatt et al., 1994; but see also Lowe and Alway, 1999;
Rosenblatt and Parry, 1993). However, this approach was criticized,
as it was suggested that the irradiation might have affected other
growth mechanisms in addition to ablating satellite cells.
After a comprehensive debate in the Journal of Applied
Physiology in 2007 (Bodine, 2007; Hikida, 2007), it was
concluded that limitations in current methodology made it difficult
to reach final conclusions on whether an increase in the number of
myonuclei is required for hypertrophy (O’Connor et al., 2007).
More recently, the debate was rejuvenated by several transgenic
models displaying large fibres without a corresponding increase in
the number of myonuclei, such as mice overexpressing the proteins
Ski (Bruusgaard et al., 2005), Akt (Blaauw et al., 2009) or junB
(Raffaello et al., 2010), as well as myostatin-null mice (Amthor
et al., 2009). However, for Ski and myostatin the hypertrophy is not
fully functional, as the specific force is reduced (Amthor et al.,
2007; Charge et al., 2002; Mendias et al., 2011). Although it was not
measured, the same is probably true for junB, as it might also act by
inhibiting myostatin (Raffaello et al., 2010).
Akt mice seemed to have normal specific force after 3 weeks of
overexpression (Blaauw et al., 2009), but it is unclear whether this
condition is sustainable over longer periods (Blaauw and Reggiani,
2014). Similarly, specific force appeared normal after 2 weeks of
overload hypertrophy in mice where 90% of satellite cells were
ablated using an inducible Pax7–diphtheria toxin transgene
(McCarthy et al., 2011). However, the latter study is problematic
because 30% of the fibres in the control material were regenerating,
questioning the validity of the observations for pre-existing fibres.
Also, I have calculated the average hypertrophy both in the control
group and the group without satellite cells to be only 10% in the
study, so the paper has little relevance to hypertrophy in excess of
that. Even though the authors more recently published a long-term
study (Fry et al., 2014), the interpretations for hypertrophy in pre-
existing fibres are confounded by the high incidence of regenerative
growth in the model used.
In conclusion, myonuclei are recruited before growth under many
hypertrophic conditions, but it is still unclear whether one can also
have a functional and sustainable hypertrophy without recruiting new
myonuclei. As discussed in the next paragraph, nuclei are not lost
during detraining or other atrophy conditions (the descending part of
the model shown in Fig. 2). This is the core of the mechanism for
muscle memory, and it allows for hypertrophic growth without
recruitment of myonuclei during re-training, not because more nuclei
are not needed in large fibres (as discussed above), but because the
nuclei are already there.
Are myonuclei lost during atrophy?
Most of the focus on atrophy and atrophy prevention has been
on satellite cells and their activation, i.e. multiplication and
differentiation into myoblasts. Based on the model shown in Fig. 2,
atrophy was interpreted as a degenerative disease where myonuclei
need to be replenished, for example, by stem cell treatment. Some
authors have even blurred the conceptual distinction between
myonuclei proper and satellite cells, and are talking about muscle
nuclei. This is unfortunate, because the functionally important nuclei
for synthesis of muscle proteins are the myonuclei, not the satellite
cells. Thus, the ability to distinguish the myonuclei both conceptually
and physically becomes crucial. Precise identification of myonuclei is
not trivial because at least half of the nuclei of muscle tissue are in
other cell types. The descending limb of the model in Fig. 2 has
become highly controversial, and previous misconception is likely to
be largely due to difficulties in identifying myonuclei.
Using in vivo time-lapse imaging where myonuclei in specific
segments of the same muscle fibre could be followed over time
(Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008), we observed that the number of
myonuclei remained constant when fibres were followed for up to
28 days after denervation, resulting in a volume loss of more than
50%. One example is shown in Fig. 3. Similar observations were
made for both fast and slow muscle, and in several different atrophy
models such as nerve impulse block with tetrodotoxin, antagonist
ablation (Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008), hind limb suspension
(Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008) and detraining (Bruusgaard
et al., 2010).
Although in vivo imaging represents direct observation of
myonuclei, several papers (e.g. Alway et al., 2003a; Ferreira et al.,
2006; Pierce et al., 2008; Siu and Alway, 2005; Siu et al., 2005; Tang
et al., 2000) have found markers for apoptosis in atrophying muscle
homogenates and have interpreted this as apoptosis of myonuclei, but
clearly this could reflect apoptosis of non-myonuclei.

larger cytoplasmic volume. During atrophy, the ‘excess’ nuclei are removed
from the syncytium by selective nuclear apoptosis. In its strictest interpretation,
the number of myonuclei are regulated such that the myonuclear domain
volume is the same for the fibre in its atrophic and hypertrophic states. Note that
the model is completely reversible; there is no apparent hysteresis or memory.

 There is also a large literature based on histological analysis using
conventional staining techniques stating that nuclei are lost by
apoptosis during atrophy (e.g. Adhihetty et al., 2007; Allen et al.,
1997; Alway et al., 2003b; Meneses et al., 2014; Tews et al., 1997;
Yoshimura and Harii, 1999). However, with such a technique it is
difficult to distinguish between nuclei of different cell types, in
particular satellite cells, which are located under the basal lamina of
the muscle fibres.
Newer studies have used antibodies against the myofibre
cytoskeleton protein dystrophin to outline the fibre surface as a way
to separate myonuclei from the nuclei of satellite and stroma cells.
Even this literature has yielded conflicting results, and the precise rules
for deeming a nucleus to be inside or outside the dystrophin ‘ring’ on
cross-sections seems to be crucial for the result. Unfortunately, these
rules are generally poorly described in the literature.
In our studies we have defined myonuclei as nuclei with their
geometrical centre inside the inner rim of the dystrophin ring
(Bruusgaard et al., 2012, 2010; Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008;
Gundersen and Bruusgaard, 2008). Using this definition, the
averages are all below 1.7 mynuclei per fibre on 8–10 µm cross-
sections. When the same operator in our laboratory evaluated the
same sections, but also included nuclei with their geometrical centre
on the dystrophin ring, the number of ‘myonuclei’ increased by 85%
(Bruusgaard et al., 2012), and it is questionable whether these were
all myonuclei. Using the strict definition, however, we have
essentially never observed apoptotic myonuclei under atrophy
conditions (Bruusgaard et al., 2012, 2010; Bruusgaard and
Gundersen, 2008; Gundersen and Bruusgaard, 2008).
Others using dytrophin staining have also described myonuclear
apoptosis and/or loss of myonuclei during atrophy (Dupont-
Versteegden et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2012; Leeuwenburgh et al.,
2005; Oishi et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2013). However, they reported a
>30% higher number of defined myonuclei (>2.2 myonuclei per
fibre) on 6–10 µm cross-sections (Dupont-Versteegden et al., 2006;
Leeuwenburgh et al., 2005; Oishi et al., 2008), suggesting that the
population of nuclei included was considerably less selective than in
our studies.
In addition to the problem of identifying myonuclei, the terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end (TUNEL) staining used
to label apoptotic nuclei is prone to false positives (Garrity et al.,
2003; Pulkkanen et al., 2000). With a labelling incidence of 1.5 nuclei
per section in normal control material from rat limb (Gundersen and
Bruusgaard, 2008), virtually no apoptotic myonuclei appeared upon
denervation, while many apoptotic nuclei appeared in mononuclear
cells (Gundersen and Bruusgaard, 2008). In contrast, a report
displaying seven-times higher incidences of TUNEL-positive nuclei
in comparable control material reported a loss of myonuclei by
apoptosis (Dupont-Versteegden et al., 2006).
Several studies based on fibres isolated ex vivo after denervation
have also concluded that myonuclei are not lost during atrophy
(Aravamudan et al., 2006; Bruusgaard et al., 2012, 2010; Duddy
et al., 2011; Wada et al., 2002). Duddy et al. (2011) used cultured,
live fibres and identified myonuclei very precisely using a muscle-
specific reporter gene. Wada et al. (2002) and Bruusgaard et al.
(2010, 2012) isolated fibres by alkaline maceration. When Wada
et al. (2002) compared this method with mechanical isolation, they
found that mechanical isolation was unreliable because of both
adhering non-myonuclei and loss of myonuclei from the fibres. This
might explain why a loss of myonuclei has been reported after
mechanical isolation (Viguie et al., 1997). Similarly, Kawano et al.
(2008) reported a loss of myonuclei after collagenase digestion, but
their myonuclear counts were three to four times higher than those
observed by in vivo imaging, suggesting that adherent cells were
also a problem with this technique.
In conclusion, by direct observation with in vivo imaging one
observes no loss of myonuclei during atrophy, and this is confirmed
by observations of isolated single fibres ex vivo when contamination
of non-myonuclei adhering to the fibres is minimized. These
observations are also confirmed by the histological studies with the
most conservative inclusion criteria for myonuclei. Similarly, the
studies with the least risk of false positive TUNEL-labelling have
failed to demonstrate apoptotic myonuclei. Thus, there is currently
no compelling reason to believe that myonuclear apoptosis occurs
under atrophy conditions. One might question whether a selective
apoptosis of some nuclei within an intact syncytium ever takes place
or is even possible. This does not exclude the possibility that whole
fibres or fibre segments could be eliminated by apoptosis, but this is
not relevant for the atrophy of pre-existing fibres.
What determines the number of myonuclei?
The conclusion that myonuclei are recruited during hypertrophy and
not lost during subsequent atrophy seems to suggest that by going
through repeated hypertrophy/atrophy cycles one could ‘pump up’
the number of nuclei indefinitely. This seemed implausible, and we
(Bruusgaard et al., 2012) therefore reinvestigated the fate of
myonuclei in the hind limb suspension model where atrophy is
induced by lifting up the hind part of rats by the tail and thereby
unloading the hind legs. Using in vivo imaging, we observed that
myonuclei were not lost during the resulting atrophy. When the
muscles were reloaded by letting the animal back down again, the
fibres displayed a 60% radial growth, and this growth was not
accompanied by any increase in the number of myonuclei. Such
growth also does not seem to require the presence of satellite cells
(Jackson et al., 2012). Thus, we suggest that hypertrophy can occur
without new myonuclei, provided the myonuclear number is
already high.
Based on data from human studies, the so-called ‘ceiling
hypothesis’ has been put forward. It states that until a certain limit
of hypertrophy is reached, hypertrophy can occur without recruiting
new myonuclei (Kadi et al., 2005). The limit has been defined as
hypertrophy above a certain per cent (e.g. 17–36%) (Kadi et al.,
2005) or as an absolute myonuclear cytoplasmic domain volume
that, when exceeded, triggers recruitment of myonuclei (Petrella
et al., 2006, 2008).
We suggest that the number of myonuclei not only reflects the
current size of the fibre as implied by the ceiling hypothesis, but also
the history of the fibre. Current data might fit a ‘peak pegging’
Fig. 3. Myonuclei are not lost during atrophy. Time-lapse in vivo imaging of
the same fibre segment before (day 0) and after 21 days of denervation. Note
that the number of nuclei in the segment left of the neuromuscular endplate

 hypothesis, where the number of myonuclei found in a fibre
represents the largest size the fibre has had in its history, and new
myonuclei are only added if the fibre grows beyond that size. This
would be analogous to a conventional minimum/maximum
thermometer, where the mercury column pushes a peg upwards
and leaves it at the highest temperature measured.
A new model for muscle size regulation
As concluded above, myonuclei seem to be recruited during
overload hypertrophy, and not lost during subsequent atrophy (see
particularly Egner et al., 2013). Thus, a previously hypertrophied
fibre would differ from a naive fibre in having more nuclei as a
‘memory of its past’. Technically, the fibre displays hysteresis: the
cyto-architecture depends on previous exposure. This observation
led us (Bruusgaard et al., 2010) to propose the model for the cell
biology of muscle size regulation illustrated in Fig. 4. In this model,
previously untrained fibres are small with few nuclei; when
subjected to a hypertrophic stimulus they acquire new nuclei
through a ‘first training route’. These new nuclei precede the growth
in time and might be causally related to the subsequent fibre
enlargement. The end product is a large fibre with many nuclei.
Upon subsequent detraining, the fibres maintain the elevated
number of nuclei, but lose protein resulting in a small fibre with a
high number of nuclei. If the fibre is re-trained from this state we
suggest that a different re-training route can be followed, skipping
the step of recruiting myonuclei. The next questions we asked were
whether this re-training route is beneficial, and whether it is easier or
faster than the first training route.
Muscle memory
The re-training route is faster
To investigate whether there is a beneficial muscle memory, Egner
et al. (2013) treated female mice with testosterone for 2 weeks. As
illustrated in Fig. 5, this led to an increase in both fibre size and the
number of nuclei. Three weeks after drug withdrawal, the fibre size
was back to normal, but the number of nuclei remained constant and
high. Three months later (>10% of the mouse lifespan), the number
of nuclei was still essentially maintained. When at this time the
muscles were subjected to overload, the high-nuclei muscles grew
by 36%, while the control group grew insignificantly by only 6%.
After that, the groups grew in parallel, but the high-nuclei group
remained larger for the duration of the 2-week overload experiment.
Egner et al. (2013) concluded that the re-training route seems to
allow faster growth than the first training route, and suggest that the
memory storage mechanism is the number of nuclei.
How lasting is the muscle memory?
We have demonstrated that in mice, the memory effect lasts for
>10% of the animal’s lifespan. In humans, the turnover of cells has
been studied by utilizing the peak in 14C availability after the post-
war atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs (Spalding et al., 2005).
Intercostal muscle tissue was harvested from two individuals (age
37–38 years) and the 14C content in genomic DNA indicated an
average age of the nuclei of 15.1 years. For several reasons this is a
low-end estimate of the possible lifespan of human myonuclei. First,
approximately half of the nuclei in the tissue are in other cell types,
mostly with a higher turnover. By comparison, in gut approximately

Fig. 4. A new model for the cell biology of hypertrophy and atrophy. For
naive fibres and preceding hypertrophic growth, myonuclei are recruited
from satellite cells, temporarily reducing the myonuclear domain volume,
leading to a large fibre with many myonuclei. Upon subsequent atrophy the
myonuclei are maintained, leading to a small fibre with a high myonuclear
density and small myonuclear domains. Such fibres can hypertrophy without
recruiting new nuclei, and this re-training route seems to be faster than the first
training route. The permanently higher number of myonuclei represents the
muscle memory. Adapted from Bruusgaard et al. (2010).

Fig. 5. Demonstration of beneficial muscle memory in
mice. Schematic representation of an experiment (Egner
et al., 2013) demonstrating the encoding, storage and
retrieval of muscle memory. The encoding occurred
during a brief exposure of the animals to testosterone,
which led to an increase in fibre size and the number of
myonuclei. When the drug was removed, fibre size
reverted to control levels of sham-treated animals, but the
high number of myonuclei was retained (storage). When
both the testosterone and the sham groups were
subjected to overload 3 months later, the former group
grew much faster than the latter group (retrieval).

Journal of Experimental Biology
 40% of the cells are epithelial with a turnover rate measured in days;
when these were excluded the average lifetime of nuclei was
increased by 50% in that tissue. Second, the measurement was from
young individuals that had been growing for a significant part of
their life and thus creating new myonuclei. Third, new myonuclei
might have been created during relatively recent strength exercise.
It is possible that myonuclei are more or less permanent once
created; for example, human brain cortical neurons appeared to be as
old as the individual (Spalding et al., 2005). For cardiomyocytes,
1% turn over annually at an age of 25 years, gradually decreasing to
0.45% at an age of 75 years. It was calculated that fewer than 50% of
cardiomyocytes are exchanged during a normal lifespan (Bergmann
et al., 2009). In contrast to the brain and heart, however, muscle
tissue is subjected to repair after damage with new nuclei from
satellite cells. How much damage and repair normally accumulates
over decades is, however, unknown. Thus, with current knowledge
it is hard to be more precise than estimating the lifespan of
myonuclei, and hence the muscle memory span, to somewhere
between 15 years and a human lifetime.
Evolutionary considerations
One might speculate as to the evolutionary origin of muscle
memory. Based on the original model (Fig. 2), it was speculated that
nuclei were lost during atrophy because they might be expensive to
maintain. ‘Cost’ might be energy or space; muscle fibres are
optimized with respect to packing contractile proteins. However, the
cost of keeping a high number of nuclei in a small fibre has never
been quantified, nor compared with the cost of eliminating and
recreating myonuclei with ever-changing demands for muscle
strength.
In the new model (Fig. 4), the muscle memory might represent an
adaptive mechanism to allow individuals from whom strength has
been demanded in the past to more quickly rebuild muscle mass in
the future, as an individual adaption or specialization. In this way,
maintaining a constant high muscle mass is avoided, for example,
during less labour-intensive seasons. As for the classical learning
and memory of the brain, ‘experience’ becomes useful if the same
task arises again.
Implications for sport and public health
Healthy ageing
Decline in muscle strength is a major health problem in the ageing
western population (Dutta and Hadley, 1995; Hughes and
Schiaffino, 1999), and more than 50% of individuals currently fill
the clinical criteria for frailty at ages >80 years (Matthews et al.,
2011). Hypertrophy induced by overload is greatly attenuated in
older animals (Alway et al., 2002; Carson et al., 1995), and the
ability to generate new myonuclei is impaired (Schultz and Lipton,
1982), possibly because of reduced notch signalling in the elderly
(Conboy et al., 2003; Conboy and Rando, 2005). The role of a
similar nuclei-related muscle memory in humans should be
investigated. Such knowledge might lead to public health advice
for strength training to recruit new myonuclei in younger
individuals, as these myonuclei might aid in maintaining muscle
mass more easily in senescence.
Doping
Muscle memory was induced in mice by testosterone, and it was
demonstrated that brief exposure to this hormone aided hypertrophy
induced by overload long after the drug was removed (Egner et al.,
2013). If this is applicable to humans, it must have consequences
for doping rules. According to Anti-Doping Norway, animal
experiments
on
the
permanency
of
recruited
myonuclei
(Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008) have already contributed to
increasing the exclusion time for doping offences from 2 to 4 years.
Given the longevity of human myonuclei, this would not be
sufficient to ensure that previous steroid use does not still give a
competitive advantage when the exclusion time is over. The
position of the World Anti-Doping Agency has been that no
regulatory action should be taken before the muscle memory
phenomenon is confirmed in humans. This raises interesting
questions about the burden of proof for convicted cheaters.
Nonetheless, if confirmed in humans, the possibility of a long-
term muscle memory induced by a brief steroid exposure raises
serious questions about the possibility of policing a drug-free sport.
Future perspectives
Although there is evidence for the new model shown in Fig. 4 and
for muscle memory induced by testosterone in rodents (Fig. 5), it
should also be demonstrated that muscle memory could be encoded
by strength exercise without steroids. As for humans, although
anecdotal evidence suggests the existence of training-induced
muscle memory, this needs to be confirmed in controlled exercise
studies.
Although the demonstrated long-lasting increase in the number of
myonuclei is a logical epigenetic substrate for the memory
phenomenon, it does by no means exclude other mechanisms.
DNA and histone modifications are now widely accepted for
gametogenesis and early cell differentiations. There is also
emerging evidence that such mechanisms occur in somatic, fully
differentiated cells such as muscle cells, and that they might play a
role in the malleability of muscle phenotype in response to exercise
(Rasmussen et al., 2014).
