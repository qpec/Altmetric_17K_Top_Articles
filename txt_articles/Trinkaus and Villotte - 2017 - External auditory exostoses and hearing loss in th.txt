Abstract
The Late Pleistocene Shanidar 1 older adult male Neandertal is known for the crushing frac-
ture of his left orbit with a probable reduction in vision, the loss of his right forearm and hand,
and evidence of an abnormal gait, as well as probable diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperosto-
sis. He also exhibits advanced external auditory exostoses in his left auditory meatus and
larger ones with complete bridging across the porus in the right meatus (both Grade 3).
These growths indicate at least unilateral conductive hearing (CHL) loss, a serious sensory
deprivation for a Pleistocene hunter-gatherer. This condition joins the meatal atresia of the
Middle Pleistocene Atapuerca-SH Cr.4 in providing evidence of survival with conductive
hearing loss (and hence serious sensory deprivation) among these Pleistocene humans.
The presence of CHL in these fossils thereby reinforces the paleobiological and archeologi-
cal evidence for supporting social matrices among these Pleistocene foraging peoples.
Introduction
Paleopathological assessments of Pleistocene human remains have increasingly identified a
suite of substantial and/or systemic developmental and degenerative abnormalities among the
remains, in addition to an abundance of minor traumatic and oral lesions [1–5]. In addition,
several abnormalities have been identified which would have impaired the normal functioning
of the individuals, especially in the context of mobile Pleistocene foraging populations [6–10].
These alterations have suggested that the levels of social support present among recent humans
(beyond the mother-child dyad) were present since the Early Pleistocene [6,9–11]. These infer-
ences have implications for the levels of social integration and complexity among these non-
modern members of the genus Homo.
In these assessments and inferences, however, there has been little consideration of impair-
ments of the basic senses, ones which would have limited the abilities of the individuals to
effectively perceive and respond appropriately to their natural and social environments. The
only possible examples are post-traumatic unilateral ocular alterations in the Shanidar 1 Nean-
dertal [6] and reduced conductive hearing in the Middle Pleistocene Atapuerca-SH Cr.4 from
auditory exostoses [12]. The presence and degree of development of external auditory

 exostoses in the Shanidar 1 cranium may provide an additional, and substantial, case of such
sensory impairment among these Pleistocene hunting-gathering populations.
External auditory exostoses (EAE) are bony growths into the auditory canal from the tym-
panic and/or squamous walls of the external auditory meatus and the margins of the auditory
porus [13,14]. They vary from small rounded protrusions to processes that largely fill the mea-
tus, are usually limited to the lateral opening of the canal (the porus), but may extend medially
to the area of the tympanic membrane. They normally do not involve or develop from the tym-
panosquamous or tympanomastoid sutures; such sutural protrusions are osteomata, or benign
neoplasms, which normally occur laterally within the meatus, are less frequent and are often
solitary [14,15] (S3 Text). Either one can reduce the lumen of the auditory meatus.
EAE have been extensively documented in clinical settings and Holocene skeletal samples
(see reviews in [13,16,17]). Their etiology in individual cases is not always apparent, but in
general they are associated with prolonged exposure of the auditory canal to cold water (for a
review, see [16]). They occur in elevated frequencies among modern participants in cold water
sports (hence references to “swimmer’s/surfer’s ear”) (e.g. [18–24]). EAE have also been exten-
sively recorded in Holocene skeletal samples, with particular attention focused on samples of
people frequently engaged in aquatic resource exploitation (e.g. [17,25–34]).
EAE presence has been noted in a couple of Middle Pleistocene humans [12,35], several
Late Pleistocene archaic humans [36–39], and a few early modern humans [40], and their
absence has been noted in a few other Pleistocene humans [41–43]. Yet, the only discussion of
the effects of such changes in the auditory canals among these Pleistocene humans has been
the mention of deafness in the Atapuerca-SH Cr.4 [12]. The pronounced ones of the Shanidar
1 Neandertal, however, may provide further insight into these aspects of Pleistocene humans.
Materials and methods
The �50 ka BP Shanidar 1 Neandertal cranium [6,44] (S1 Text) was analyzed visually with low
magnification assessment of the intact right and left external auditory meatus in the Iraq
Museum, Baghdad in 1976–78. It is part of the largely complete skeleton of an adult (40–50
years old, based on his pubic symphysis and dental wear comparisons to the histologically
aged Shanidar 2 to 6) male (pelvically sexed based on the greater sciatic notch) [6,45]. Cranial
radiography was not available in the Iraq Museum, and reanalysis since then has not been fea-
sible. Observations are therefore based on the externally visible configurations of the auditory
pori and lateral meatus (Fig 1).
The degree of development of the EAE is scored using an ordinal scale of Grade 0 (absence
of EAE) to Grade 3 (large EAE that largely block the meatus) (Grade 1: <1/3; Grade 2: 1/3–2/3;
Grade 3: >2/3) [19,25,26] (see also [13]). Similar observations are provided for four other Nean-
dertals with EAE, the younger adult Spy 1 and Tabun 1 and the modestly older La Chapelle-
aux-Saints 1 partial skeletons, plus the Krapina 39.1 isolated mature temporal bone (S2 Text).
The Shanidar 1 external auditory meatus
Both of the external auditory meatus (EAM) of Shanidar 1 are well preserved; inferiorly the
tympanic and adjacent portions of the temporal bone present little of note (Fig 1, S1 Text).
The tympanic bones are complete, fully fused to the squamous and petrous portions, with
complete closure of the foramina of Huschke.
The left porus (Fig 1A) has a normal anterior portion of the tympanic bone, that leads into
a thick and inferiorly protruding tympanic bone against the mastoid process. There are no
alterations of the adjacent squamous and mastoid bone. There is a large growth protruding lat-
erally and anteriorly into the porus along all of the posterior side of the porus. It is on the

 lateral surface of the posterosuperior tympanic bone, but it extends anterosuperiorly into the
porus and more medially into the meatus. Superiorly, this exostosis is very close to a small
exostosis within the meatus, one which grew posteroinferiorly from the superior portion of the
tympanic bone, immediately below the tympanosquamous suture. In addition, deeper within
the meatus but laterally visible, there is a rounded protrusion extending close to the middle of
the canal from the posteroinferior tympanic bone and a smaller one deep on the anterior tym-
panic bone. Together these growths provide the Shanidar 1 left EAM with a Grade 3 score.
The lateral opening of the canal was reduced to a very small one in the middle of its anterior
portion.
The right external auditory meatus and porus of Shanidar 1 (Fig 1B) has a more pronounced
EAE development than the left one. The inferolateral margin of the tympanic bone is normal, as
are the surrounding squamous and mastoid portions. Protruding laterally and especially anteri-
orly from the mid-posterior tympanic bone is a large and bulbous exostosis, the major portion
of which extends to the middle of the meatus. Its posterior portion continues superiorly to
where it approaches the superior extent of the anterior tympanic bone. But across the middle of
the opening, the large exostosis narrows and then connects to a pair of more modest exostoses,
which extend laterally and posteriorly from the mid-anterior tympanic bone.
This combination of right meatal growths completely blocks the middle of the porus, leav-
ing only small openings anterosuperiorly and posteroinferiorly. They are then joined by a
small protuberance within the meatus projecting inferiorly from the superior-most anterior
tympanic bone. These large EAE, and especially the bridging of them across the middle of the
porus, provide the Shanidar 1 right auditory canal with a serious Grade 3 score.
Data on the shapes of the more medial canal are not fully available; the visible EAE may
extend medially along the auditory canals, as is indicated by the small ones within each meatus.

 The medial canals adjacent to the area of the tympanic membrane are nonetheless conserva-
tively assumed to be normal.
The external auditory meatus of this moderately older Neandertal therefore present slightly
different patterns of abnormalities. The left one approximates the marked patterns occasion-
ally encountered in recent humans. The right one extends to the upper end of the four-part
ordinal scale.
Discussion
Shanidar 1
The degree of development of the Shanidar 1 EAE is associated with conductive hearing loss
(CHL) in extant humans [19,21,23,24,46–49]. Most EAE are located laterally in the auditory
canal; as a result, usually they do not impinge directly on the tympanic membrane. Yet, they
may extend medially, causing stenosis of the canal and associated CHL [50]. Even though indi-
viduals vary in their rates of production of cerumen and responses to irritation of the auditory
canal, large (Grade 3) EAE would make it extremely difficult for the normal irrigation of the
ear canal to cleanse the cerumen and exogenous debris from the canal [14,47,51]. The accumu-
lated material, in combination with the exostoses, would then reduce both the sound transmis-
sion through the ear canal and the ability of the tympanic membrane to transmit the sound
waves to the middle ear [52,53]. Impacted cerumen and exogenous material in the canal is
therefore a common cause of CHL in recent humans.
The left meatus of Shanidar 1 is likely to have accumulated sufficient material to produce
CHL, given its large posterior exostoses across at least half of the lateral opening. The right
one, however, would have led to the presence of cerumen and other debris behind the bony
bridging that connects the anterior and posterior exostoses. It would have been essentially
impossible for Shanidar 1 to maintain a sufficiently clear canal for adequate sound transmis-
sion. He would therefore have been effectively deaf in his right ear, and he likely had at least
partial CHL in the left ear.
Consequently, Shanidar 1 appears to have had an advanced degree of unilateral conductive
hearing loss and reduced hearing acuity on both sides. In addition to a general reduction in
hearing acuity, unilateral CHL limits one’s ability to discern the signal from background noise
and to locate sounds in space. Among modern urban children it is associated with varying
degrees of reduced academic progress [53], and hearing loss in living adults is associated with
difficulties in communication, information exchange and social interactions, decreased mental
and physical function, isolation, and psychological disorders [54–56].
In addition to a reduced effectiveness in communication and coordinated social activities
(among these fully linguistic Paleolithic foragers [57–59]), it would have had more direct con-
sequences. Hearing acuity is related to hunting effectiveness among recent human foragers
[60]. Hearing is an important component of learning lithic technology [61]. Well developed
auditory acuity is especially important in providing feedback during multistep lithic reduction
that requires the fashioning of both sequential striking platforms and the desired tool [61]; this
requirement applies to Acheulian bifaces and subsequent lithic procedures. CHL would also
have made the individual vulnerable to medium to large carnivores, predators that were ubiq-
uitous in Late Pleistocene Eurasia [62], the Zagros Mountains [63] and at Shanidar Cave [64].
Shanidar 1 also experienced a suite of other degenerative difficulties [6,44,65] (S1 Text). He
is best known for his withered right shoulder and arm, that was little more than a weakened
stump extending to just proximal of the elbow; it was most likely amputated above the elbow,
possibly after a non-union fracture and associated atrophy. He had a laterally crushing fracture
of the left orbit (probably altering and/or reducing vision). He experienced right genual and

 pedal trauma and osteoarthritis producing an abnormal gait (reflected in right talar remodel-
ing and left tibiofibular posterior bowing), thereby impairing his landscape mobility and agil-
ity. And there is evidence of probable hyperostotic disease (DISH), which is associated with
muscular tendinosis and reduced back and appendicular ranges of motion. It is therefore in
addition to these degenerative conditions that any degree of hearing loss would have com-
pounded the limited abilities of this individual to function.
Other Pleistocene human external auditory exostoses
As noted above, external auditory exostoses have been observed in other Pleistocene humans,
but most of them are modest in size. Four other Neandertals, La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1, Kra-
pina 39.1, Spy 1 and Tabun 1, exhibit large EAE, ones which would be scored as Grade 2 [S2
Text]. Their bony growths are less likely by themselves to have produced advanced CHL, but
they probably reduced the abilities of those individuals to cleanse their auditory canals and
hence maintain auditory acuity.
In addition, the Middle Pleistocene (�430 ka) Atapuerca–SH Cr.4 [66] developed bilateral
Grade 2 EAE, but it resulted in atresia of the auditory canal [12]. This narrowing of the canal is
usually a rare congenital condition, occurring in 1 out of 10,000–20,000 individuals, most
often unilaterally [14,67,68]. The condition in Atapuerca-SH Cr.4 appears to be the result of
the EAE extending medially and almost entirely blocking the canals. The degree of CHL asso-
ciated with this degree of aural atresia would be moderate to severe [53], and it would therefore
have had consequences similar to those for Shanidar 1.
Pleistocene human social support
The advanced EAE of Shanidar 1, as well as that of Atapuerca-SH Cr.4, and the consequent
CHL raise the question of social assistance among Pleistocene archaic Homo. The presence of
social support among non-modern Pleistocene humans, as noted above, has been inferred for
a number of Pleistocene individuals with substantial abnormalities and varying degrees of loss
of function (e.g. [6,7,9–11,44] (see [69]). Comparisons with non-captive non-human primates,
however, have questioned whether some of these abnormalities would have been sufficient to
require social support in order for the individual to survive [70–72] (note, however, that the
survival of macaques with congenital limb deformities documented by Turner et al. [72] is not
relevant, because they were provisioned and hence had “social support”). For example, apes
born with congenital disorders are sometimes maintained by their mothers for extended peri-
ods of time through infancy [73]. Apes lacking one eye appear to manage effectively in the
wild [74]. Apes who have lost a hand or a foot (as in a snare) are able to climb and forage,
although less effectively than their conspecifics [75,76]. And wild-shot primates are known (if
rare) with up to two thirds of the dentition lost antemortem [10,77].
The non-human primate examples provided here are relevant for inferences regarding sev-
eral Neandertals with partial loss of function. For example, the survival of the developmentally
abnormal of the Pech-de-l’Aze
´ 1 Neandertal child [78] should represent maternal support of
an affected offspring. The apparent unilateral impaired vision of Shanidar 1, by itself, may not
have limited his abilities. The upper limb fractures of Feldhofer 1 and Krapina 180 and 188.8
[79,80], as well as the right arm and shoulder of Shanidar 1, limited or severely reduced the
utilities of the affected arms; yet, by themselves they would have implied only partial loss of for-
aging ability. The extensive antemortem tooth loss of La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1, and the less
pronounced losses of Shanidar 4 and 5 [6,81], need not have limited their abilities to ingest
food. However, the Aubesier 11 Neandertal and the Early Pleistocene Dmanisi D3444/D3900
experienced extensive antemortem tooth loss and (more importantly) pervasive infectious

 alteration of the maxilla and/or mandible [9,10]; they are joined by the Guattari 1 edentulous
cranium with palatomaxillary inflammation [82]. Considerations of these fossils that only
addressed the tooth loss [70,71] missed the point; these individuals had severely impaired oral
tissues and not merely a loss of teeth. In addition, as emphasized by Hublin [69], the long term
persistence of the Middle Pleistocene Atapuerca-SH Cr.14 and Sale
´ 1 with substantial congeni-
tal abnormalities (cranial synostosis and torticollis, respectively) [7,11] imply care beyond the
infantile maternal support evident among non-human primates.
In this context, the conductive hearing loss (CHL) of Shanidar 1 and Atapuerca-SH Cr.4
join several other Pleistocene archaic Homo individuals (if not all of the ones that have been
invoked in the past) in indicating some level of social support. Moreover, although one could
discuss the degrees to which support would have been necessary for the survival of those indi-
viduals with degenerating mastication or cranial developmental defects, an individual with
advanced CHL would have been highly vulnerable alone in a Pleistocene foraging context (see
above). For Shanidar 1, the CHL was associated with loss of function in other aspects of his
biology, all of which would have compounded his need for support, even if some of the indi-
vidual deficiencies by themselves would not have required such assistance.
The inferred presence of social support among at least the Neandertals should not be sur-
prising. There is abundant evidence of intentional burial of the dead [83], even if not all of the
known remains derive from such burials. Explicit mortuary practice reflects, ultimately, the
presence of social cohesion, social roles, and hence mutual support [84,85], such as would have
led to the caring of the impaired. There are items of personal decoration [86–88] and the use
of pigments [89,90], which are modifications of one’s visual persona and hence a reflection of
social identity manipulation and social cohesion. A number of Neandertal sites exhibit distinct
spatial organization (e.g. [91–94]), reflecting coordinated use of the occupied space. There is
evidence for division of labor by age and sex among them [95,96], reflecting the social integra-
tion of different roles. Moreover, whatever the Late Pleistocene human population dynamics
might have been [97,98], it is increasingly apparent that the behavioral differences between the
Neandertals and their modern human contemporaries and successors were modest [99–101].
Conclusion
The Shanidar 1 Neandertal, in addition to his other traumatic and degenerative lesions, devel-
oped advanced external auditory exostoses, largely blocking the meatus on the left side and
bridging across the auditory porus on the right side. Although a normal bony growth in the
context of irritation of the external auditory canal, the extent of exostosis development in Sha-
nidar 1 indicates a marked degree of conductive hearing loss. It joins the Middle Pleistocene
Atapuerca-SH Cr.4, with its auditory atresia and associated deafness, in indicating survival of
these sensorily impaired archaic humans despite the rigors and dangers of a Middle-to-Late
Pleistocene foraging existence. A substantial degree of social support, especially given Shanidar
1’s plethora of other impairments, is indicated.
