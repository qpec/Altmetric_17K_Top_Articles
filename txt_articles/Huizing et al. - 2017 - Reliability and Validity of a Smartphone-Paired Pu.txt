Introduction 
 
There is overwhelming evidence that pulse oximetry 
screening increases early detection of critical congenital 
heart defects (CCHD) in newborns  
[1–5] 
. Consequently, 
many programs and groups around the world have rec-
ommended and adopted this type of screening  
[4, 6–10] 
. 
However, barriers to widespread implementation of pulse 
oximetry screening of CCHD include increasing trends 
of out-of-hospital births, cost of implementation (equip-
ment and staff costs), and management of test positives 
(neonatal admissions and echocardiography)  
[11] 
.

Abstract 
 
Background: Barriers to widespread implementation of 
pulse oximetry screening of critical congenital heart defects 
(CCHD) in newborns include increasing trends of out-of-hos-
pital births and cost of equipment. In recent years, smart-
phone-compatible pulse oximeters have appeared on the 
market, but the validity of such devices in the setting of 
CCHD screening has not been evaluated.  
Objectives: To 
compare the performance in CCHD screening of a smart-
phone-paired pulse oximeter (Masimo iSpO 
2 
-Rx 
TM 
) and a 
hospital-grade pulse oximeter (Masimo Radical-7 
TM 
).  
Meth-
ods: Preductal (right hand) and postductal (either foot) satu-
rations were determined in a population of 201 term new-
borns by 2 independent teams, one using the Radical-7 and 
the other using the iSpO 
2 
-Rx. Bland-Altman analysis was ap-
plied to calculate mean bias and 95% limits of agreement 
between the 2 pulse oximeters.  
Results: For the preductal 
oxygen saturation, the mean bias (Radical-7 minus iSpO 
2 
-Rx) 
was –0.08 (SD 1.76) and the lower and upper limits of agree-
ment were –3.52 and 3.36, respectively. For the postductal

When selecting a pulse oximeter for CCHD screening, 
it is recommended that the monitor should be approved 
for use in neonates, be motion tolerant, and be able to read 
through low perfusion  
[10, 12] 
. Therefore 
,  
hospital-grade 
pulse oximeters are used in all screening programs  
[2, 5–9, 
13, 14] 
. Nevertheless, the price of such devices is a limita-
tion for the extension of the CCHD pulse oximetry screen-
ing to home births and low-resource settings. In recent 
years, several manufacturers have developed low-cost 
pulse oximeters devices that can be paired to a smart-
phone or a tablet  
[15–17] 
. The inherent computing power 
of the mobile phone or tablet and its everyday availability 
offer the opportunity to create a low-cost stand-alone de-
vice which may extend pulse oximetry from hospital into 
nonhospital settings  
[16, 17] 
. However, to the best of our 
knowledge, none of these devices has been tested in the 
setting of CCHD screening. In this investigator-initiated 
study, we compared the performance in CCHD screening 
of a smartphone-paired pulse oximeter (Masimo iSpO 
2 
-
Rx 
TM 
) and a hospital-grade pulse oximeter (Masimo Rad-
ical-7 
TM 
) from the same manufacturer. 
 
Methods 
 
Study Subjects and Protocol 
 
The study was approved by the local ethics committee and in-
formed consent of the parents was obtained. All healthy term (>37 
weeks) infants born at the Maastricht University Medical Center 
(MUMC) were potentially eligible for the study. 
 
The equipment and supplies used in the study were acquired at 
market price by the purchasing department of MUMC. Pulse ox-
imetry screening of CCHD was introduced in MUMC in January 
2016 as part of the routine care of healthy newborns. The screening 
is performed by trained nurses using the Masimo Radical-7 (Ma-
simo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA; price in the Netherlands: EUR 1,800) 
equipped with disposable Masimo LNCS sensors. Screening is per-
formed 12–24 h after birth and involves preductal (right-hand) 
and postductal (either foot) measurements. Screenings before
12 h or after 24 h are also allowed. Whenever possible, it is at-
tempted to screen infants awake, quiet, and without pacifier, bot-
tle, or concurrent feeding. 
 
The infants included in the study were subjected to a second 
screening with a Masimo iSpO 
2 
-Rx pulse oximeter (price in the 
Netherlands: EUR 300) equipped with a reusable Masimo M-
LNCS YI sensor and connected to a tablet (Apple iPad mini). The 
iSpO 
2 
-Rx is a CE-marked, dual-wave pulse oximeter equipped 
with signal extraction technology (SET 
TM 
) that, according to the 
manufacturer, provides reliable readings even in low-perfusion 
states and with patient movements  
[18, 19] 
. The companion soft-
ware application (app) provides the oxygen saturation, the pulse 
rate, and the perfusion index  
[17, 19] 
. The screening with the 
iSpO 
2 
-Rx took place either before or after the routine screening 
with the Radical-7 and was performed by one of the investigators 
(M.J.H., I.A.C., or E.V.). The Radical-7 and the iSpO 
2 
-Rx screen-
ing teams proceeded independently and were unaware of each 
other’
s results. 
 
A screening result was labeled as “fail” if any oxygen saturation 
measure was  
≤ 
89%. Any screening that was  
≥ 
95% in either ex-
tremity with  
≤ 
3% absolute difference in oxygen saturation be-
tween the upper and lower extremity was considered a “pass” re-
sult, and screening was ended. When saturation in both extremi-
ties was  
≥ 
90% but  
≤ 
94% or one of the saturations was  
≥ 
95 but 
there was a  
≥ 
4% absolute difference in oxygen saturation between 
the right hand and foot, the screening result was labeled as “repeat” 
and repeated after 1 h. Two consecutive “repeat” results were con-
sidered as a positive screening. For the purpose of the study, only 
the result of the first measurement was taken into account.
 
 
In order to evaluate the performance of the iSpO 
2 
-Rx pulse ox-
imeter in detecting low oxygen saturations, a group of 12 infants 
admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the MUMC 
and showing a stable saturation <95% were also included in the 
study. These infants were continuously monitored with an Intel-
liVue MP70 patient monitor (Philips Medical Systems, The Neth-
erlands) equipped with a Masimo SET 
TM OEM board pulse oxim-
eter. This pulse oximeter was maintained in one foot and the
iSpO 
2 
-Rx was connected to the other foot. Oxygen saturation was 
simultaneously measured in both feet during 10 min and recorded 
every minute.
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
Results are expressed as counts and percentages, median and 
interquartile range (IQR, Q1–Q3), or means and standard devia-
tion (SD). For agreement between the two pulse oximeters, a 
Bland-Altman analysis was applied calculating bias as the mean 
difference between both pulse oximeters and limits of agreement 
(bias ±1.96 SD) as the range in which 95% of the differences be-
tween the two measurements are expected to lie  
[20, 21] 
. Sample 
size was determined based on Bland’
s recommendation of using a 
sample size of 200 subjects to accurately estimate the limits of 
agreement between 2 devices or methods of measurement  
[20] 
.
 
Results 
 
Duplicated screening with the Radical-7 and the
iSpO 
2 
-Rx was performed in 201 term infants (51% fe-
male) born between July 12, 2016 and February 7, 2017. 
Screening with the Radical-7 took place at a median time 
of 21.2 h (IQR 16.4–24.6) and screening with the iSpO 
2 
-
Rx took place at a median time of 22.2 h (IQR 18.0–27.0). 
The median difference between the measurements with 
the Radical-7 and the iSpO 
2 
-Rx was 1.2 h (IQR 0.3–6.1).
 
For the preductal oxygen saturation, the mean bias 
(Radical-7 minus iSpO 
2 
-Rx) was –0.08 (SD 1.76) and the 
lower and upper limits of agreement (bias ± 1.96 SD) were 
–3.52 and 3.36, respectively ( 
Fig. 1 
). For the postductal 
oxygen saturation, the mean bias (Radical-7 minus
iSpO 
2 
-Rx) was –0.11 (SD 1.68) and the lower and upper 
limits of agreement (bias ± 1.96 SD) were –3.41 and 3.18, 
respectively ( 
Fig. 2 
).

In 196 of the 201 infants (97.6%), the screening was 
labeled as “pass” with both devices after the first measure-
ment. In 5 cases the results of the first measurement were 
discrepant between the two pulse oximeters. Two cases 
were labeled as “repeat” with the Radical-7 (preductal-
postductal saturations: 94–94 and 92–94) but as “pass” 
with the iSpO 
2 
-Rx (preductal-postductal saturations: 94–
96 and 96–99, respectively). Two cases were labeled as 
“pass” with the Radical-7 (preductal-postductal satura-
tions: 98–97 and 98–99), but as “repeat” with the iSpO 
2 
-
Rx (preductal-postductal saturations: 97–93 and 100–94, 
respectively). Finally, in one case the infant failed the

screening with the Radical-7 (preductal-postductal satu-
ration: 91–88) but the result with the iSpO 
2 
-Rx was la-
beled as “repeat” (preductal-postductal saturation: 92–
90). This infant showed a mild respiratory distress and 
was immediately admitted to the neonatal unit where sat-
urations around 90% were confirmed. No heart murmur 
or other abnormalities were detected by physical exami-
nation. Treatment with antibiotics was started under the 
diagnosis of suspected sepsis. Saturations and the clinical 
condition of the infant improved in the following hours 
and echocardiography was not considered necessary.
 
As mentioned in the methods section, in 12 NICU pa-
tients (8 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 2 with pul-
monary hypertension, 1 with hypoplastic left ventricle 
and 1 with tetralogy of Fallot) under continuous monitor-
ing with a Masimo SET pulse oximeter and showing post-
ductal (foot) saturations <95%, we performed a simulta-
neous measurement of the saturation with the iSpO 
2 
-Rx 
in the contralateral foot. Ten measurements per infant 
were recorded showing a mean bias (Masimo SET minus 
iSpO 
2 
-Rx) of 0.01 (SD 1.74) with lower and upper limits 
of agreement (bias ± 1.96 SD) of –3.42 and 3.43, respec-
tively ( 
Fig. 3 
). Visual inspection of the Bland-Altman 
scatterplots ( 
Fig. 1–3 
) revealed no distinct patterns or 
funneling that would indicate important heteroscedastic-
ity (i.e., larger variability for higher saturation values) 
 
[22] 
.
 
Discussion 
 
We examined the performance of the Masimo iSpO 
2 
-
Rx, a smartphone-paired pulse oximeter, in the setting of 
CCHD screening in 201 newborn infants. The iSpO 
2 
-Rx 
demonstrated a high degree of agreement with the Ma-
simo Radical-7, a hospital-grade pulse oximeter. More-
over, the iSpO 
2 
-Rx provided reliable measurements of 
saturations below 95% in a group of NICU patients. We 
did not observe any systematic bias and the differences 
between the two pulse oximeters can be attributed to the 
inherent bias that all saturation monitors have when they 
function according to their specifications  
[18] 
. Unfortu-
nately, we can only speculate on this point because we did 
not perform repeated measurements with any of the two 
devices in order to estimate the inherent bias in our set-
ting. Nevertheless, it should be noted that current indus-
try data report neonatal-based pulse oximetry algorithms 
to have a precision (SD of the bias) that can be as low as 
2% on some monitors but as high as 5% on others  
[18] 
. 
Interestingly, the SD of the bias that we observed between 
the Radical-7 and the iSpO 
2 
-Rx was less than 2%. There-
fore, altogether, our data suggest that CCHD screening 
with the iSpO 
2 
-Rx is feasible and accurate.
 
In the Netherlands, pulse oximetry screening of CCHD 
has not been included in the universal screening pro-
gram, but an implementation performing trial aiming to

screen 20,000 infants in the Amsterdam-Haarlem-Leiden 
region is currently underway  
[13] 
. As analyzed by Nara-
yen et al. 
 [13, 14] 
, the perinatal health care system in the 
Netherlands is unique due to its high incidence of home 
births and early discharge after uncomplicated deliveries. 
In total, 33% of all low-risk deliveries are supervised by a 
community midwife, of which 55% occur at home and 
45% at a birthing facility or policlinic  
[13, 14] 
. Therefore, 
it has been estimated that implementation of a universal 
pulse oximetry screening of CCHD in the Netherlands 
would require the provision of pulse oximeters and ade-
quate training to all 1,800 community midwives  
[13] 
. A 
reliable smartphone-paired pulse oximeter would offer a 
reduction of the cost and, simultaneously, an improve-
ment in the quality of the screening. The latter can be 
achieved through the development of smartphone apps 
that guide the user in performing and interpreting the 
pulse oximetry screening. 
 
Earlier studies have shown the feasibility of home-
birth screening of CCHD with hospital-grade portable 
pulse oximeters  
[13, 14, 23] 
. Besides the Netherlands, 
rates of planned out-of-hospital birth (i.e., births intend-
ed to occur at home or at a freestanding birth center) have 
increased in high- and middle-income countries  
[24–26] 
. 
In addition, there is an increasing tendency toward early 
discharge after uncomplicated deliveries in hospital  
[13] 
. 
This may increase the necessity of performing domicili-
ary CCHD screening in high- and middle-income coun-
tries and good quality smartphone pulse oximeters could 
be applied for these settings. 
 
 
CCHD screening has less priority in low-income coun-
tries because treatment options are limited  
[27] 
. Howev-
er, since CCHD screening is based on the detection of 
hypoxemia, infants with a positive screen may have an-
other potentially serious and treatable condition, such as 
neonatal sepsis  
[1–5] 
. Simple procedures for identifying 
infants with infection that need referral for treatment are 
of major public health importance  
[28] 
. Providing a more 
extensive access to pulse oximetry in the first hours of life 
may reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity by early 
detection of hypoxemia in conditions such as sepsis, 
pneumonia, or other infections  
[2, 27] 
. 
 
As claimed by several CCHD-screening advocates, the 
question is not whether we should implement an inex-
pensive, quick, painless screen with the potential to save 
lives, but how it should be implemented  
[4, 29] 
. Smart-
phones are powerful tools that offer both computational 
and communication opportunities which can be lever-
aged for the benefit of health care  
[17, 30] 
. Our study sug-
gests that one of these benefits could be the extension of 
the screening of CCHD, as well as other forms of clini-
cally undetectable hypoxemia, to a larger neonatal popu-
lation.
