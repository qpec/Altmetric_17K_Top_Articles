Continuity of Primary Care and Emergency Hospital 
Admissions Among Older Patients in England
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Secondary health care services have been under considerable pres-
sure in England as attendance rates increase, resulting in longer waiting times 
and greater demands on staff. This study’s aim was to examine the association 
between continuity of care and risk of emergency hospital admission among 
older adults.
METHODS We analyzed records from 10,000 patients aged 65 years and older 
in 2012 within 297 English general practices obtained from the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink and linked with Hospital Episode Statistics. We used the Bice 
and Boxerman (BB) index and the appointed general practitioner index (last gen-
eral practitioner consulted before hospitalization) to quantify patient-physician 
continuity. The BB index was used in a prospective cohort approach to assess 
impact of continuity on risk of admission. Both indices were used in a separate 
retrospective nested case-control approach to test the effect of changing physi-
cian on the odds of hospital admission in the following 30 days.
RESULTS In the prospective cohort analysis, the BB index showed a graded, non-
significant inverse relationship of continuity of care with risk of emergency hospi-
tal admission, although the hazard ratio for patients experiencing least continuity 
was 2.27 (95% CI, 1.37-3.76) compared with those having complete continuity. 
In the retrospective nested case-control analysis, we found a graded inverse rela-
tionship between continuity of care and emergency hospital admission for both 
BB and appointed general practitioner indices: for the latter, the odds ratio for 
those experiencing least continuity was 2.32 (95% CI, 1.48-3.63) relative to those 
experiencing most continuity.
CONCLUSIONS Marked discontinuity of care might contribute to increased 
unplanned hospital admissions among patients aged 65 years and older. 
Schemes to enhance continuity of care have the potential to reduce hospital 
admissions.

INTRODUCTION
A
cute hospital services in England have been under increasing pres-
sure. Evidence suggests that many patients presenting for unsched-
uled secondary care could be managed in primary care.1,2 Aspects 
of general practice therefore might be associated with emergency depart-
ment attendance and unplanned hospital admission.
Two systematic reviews have concluded that better clinician continu-
ity of care (seeing the same clinician over time) reduces hospitalization.3,4 
Recent analyses of the Taiwanese Longitudinal health Insurance Database 
produced similar findings.5-7
Studies investigating the impact of continuity of care using individual-
patient UK data for acute presentations are scarce, however. Salisbury 
et al8 focused on multimorbidity and continuity of care, while Ridd et 
al9 focused on continuity and diagnosis of cancer, but neither included 
acute care. Barker et al10 found an association between higher continuity 
of care and fewer admissions for ambulatory care–sensitive conditions.

Other UK-based studies have used information from 
the General Practitioner Patient Survey, providing 
information at the practice level such as the propor-
tion of patients able to consult their preferred general 
practitioner.11-15 These ecological studies differ in their 
findings regarding the impact of continuity of care on 
(unplanned) hospital admission, however.
In the United Kingdom, patients are registered at 
one general practice but might see different physicians 
within that practice. On the basis of the assumption 
that the general practitioner regularly seen by the 
patient knows that patient well, we hypothesized that 
better continuity of care specifically with that physi-
cian would be associated with a lower risk of emer-
gency hospital admission at the individual patient level. 
We focused on older adults as they are seen more fre-
quently in primary care than younger adults16 and are 
at greater risk for acute hospital admission.17
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
We obtained data from the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink (CPRD), which contains current data on 4.4 
million anonymized patients (6.9% of the UK popula-
tion) and is nationally representative in terms of age, 
sex, and ethnicity.18 A practice-level deprivation score, 
Index of Multiple Deprivation 2010 quintile, was cal-
culated after practice postcodes were mapped to geo-
graphic regions termed lower-layer super output areas, 
and practices were categorized as conurbation, urban, 
or rural. Staff roles of the clinician at each consulta-
tion were recorded, and data were obtained on each 
patient’s date of consultations, sex, and year of birth.18 
The CPRD can be linked with Hospital Episode Statis-
tics and Office for National Statistics mortality data in 
England,19 and we studied patients in CPRD who could 
be linked by their National Health Service number to 
Hospital Episode Statistics data, which showed emer-
gency hospital admissions in the fiscal years 2012-2014. 
We drew a random sample of 10,000 patients aged 
65 years and older in 2012 within 297 English practices 
from all patients in the CPRD source population, strat-
ified by general practitioner practice, and also sampling 
so that the proportions of patients in each practice in 
the sample matched the proportions among eligible 
patients. When undertaking this study, previous evi-
dence for the effect of continuity of care4 consisted of 
4 relevant studies: the only one using individual data 
among older adults reported an odds ratio of 0.67 for 
ambulatory care–sensitive hospitalizations.20 We had 
anticipated an emergency admission incidence of 125 
per 1,000: when dividing patients equally into “high-
continuity” and “low-continuity” groups, an odds ratio 
of 0.67 would be detectable with 90% power at the 
P = .05 level with only 3,000 patients. As other evi-
dence4 suggested that this effect size was optimistic, 
we selected 10,000 patients (the maximum possible 
given the project budget), which allowed 90% power 
to detect a risk ratio of 0.83 (approximately one-half 
the effect size initially estimated).
We tested our hypothesis using 2 approaches: a 
prospective cohort approach to assess the general 
impact of continuity of care on emergency admissions 
and a nested case-control approach to assess whether 
seeing general practitioners other than the usual one 
increases the risk or odds of emergency admission dur-
ing the following 30 days.
Prospective Cohort Approach
For the prospective cohort approach, the observation 
period for patients’ general practitioner consultation 
history ran from April 1, 2010, to March 30, 2014, 
or earlier if patients left their current practice, for 
example, moving or dying (censored observation), or 
if they were admitted to the hospital between April 
2012 and March 2014. Patients were selected if they 
made at least 2 general practitioner consultations after 
March 2012; in total 8,248 patients in our sample 
were included in the prospective cohort analysis. The 
observation period during which those patients were 
at risk for an emergency hospital admission started on 
the date of the second general practitioner consulta-
tion after March 2012 and ended on March 30, 2014, 
or earlier if they left the practice (Supplementary Fig-
ure 1, http://www.annfammed.org/content/15/6/515/
suppl/DC1). In total, 1,828 of the 8,248 patients had an 
emergency hospital admission within that time period.
Nested Case-Control Approach
For the nested case-control approach, we identi-
fied patients with an emergency hospital admission 
between April 1, 2012, and March 30, 2014. Patients 
were included as cases only if they had at least 2 gen-
eral practitioner consultations in the 2 years before 
hospital admission, of which the last was within 30 
days before that admission (Supplementary Figure 2, 
http://www.annfammed.org/content/15/6/515/suppl/
DC1). We chose a period of 30 days to capture a time 
span over which the general practitioner’s care might 
affect the chance of an emergency admission. In total, 
1,215 patients were selected as potential case patients. 
Control patients were defined as those not experi-
encing an emergency hospital admission, and were 
matched with case patients on the following charac-
teristics: general practitioner practice, age-group, and 
occurrence of last general practitioner consultation 
30 days before hospitalization of the matched case

patient, with at least 1 other consultation made in the 
previous 2 years. We did not limit the number of con-
trols per case. In total, 769 (63.3%) of the case patients 
could be matched, and 2,123 patients qualified to be 
control patients (Supplementary Figure 3, http://www.
annfammed.org/content/15/6/515/suppl/DC1).
Outcome Measure
Our main outcome measure was the first emergency 
hospital admission between April 2012 and March 
2014. We did not make any distinction between admis-
sions by specific routes, that is, admission through the 
emergency department or admission via direct general 
practitioner referral to a hospital specialty.
Measures of Continuity of Care
We measured longitudinal continuity of care (con-
sultations over time with as few different doctors as 
possible).21 Practice staff identified as senior partners, 
partners, or salaried partners were classified as general 
practitioners. Labels such as associate and assistant, 
which might or might not indicate a general practi-
tioner, made up very few consultations (each less than 
0.4%) and were excluded. Locum consultations were 
also excluded as numbers were small (approximately 
2%). Consultation locations included clinics, home 
visits, out-of-hours visits, telephone consultations, and 
third-party consultations; multiple consultations occur-
ring on the same day for an individual patient were 
counted as separate consultations.
We used 2 indices to measure longitudinal conti-
nuity of care: one that requires an assigned clinician 
and one that does not.22 The Bice and Boxerman (BB) 
index,23 which does not need an assigned general prac-
titioner, is also known as the Continuity of Care index. 
We divided BB index scores into 6 categories; patients 
with a score of 0 (complete absence of continuity of 
care) and of 1 (complete continuity of care), and 4 
quartiles of those with scores falling between 0 and 1. 
In a sensitivity analysis, the BB index score was divided 
into tertiles, not separating patients with scores of 0 and 
of 1.24 The provider identification index25 (see Supple-
mentary Textbox 1, http://www.annfammed.org/con-
tent/15/6/515/suppl/DC1) requires an assigned clinician. 
The score for this index, which we termed appointed 
general practitioner index, is the proportion of visits 
during the study period to the general practitioner most 
recently visited before the index event of hospitalization 
for the case patients; we divided scores into quartiles.
Measures of Confounding Variables
Our choice of confounding variables was guided by 
the QAdmissions score,26 previously developed using 
data from a similar routine general practitioner data-
base to predict hospital admissions. We included age, 
sex, number of general practitioner consultations, 
and having had a previous emergency hospital admis-
sion in 2010-2012. We also included the following 
morbidities measured before April 2012 (presence of 
each diagnosis was ascertained using published clini-
cal code lists as collected in the Manchester Clinical 
Codes repository27): epilepsy,28 chronic renal disease,29 
cancer,30 asthma,29 stroke,31 coronary heart disease,31 
diabetes,31 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,28 
depression,32 and schizophrenia.32 Furthermore, we 
took into account clustering at the practice level33: we 
included practice-level information including depriva-
tion, location (conurbation, urban, rural), and estimated 
the number of general practitioners in a practice ascer-
tained from consultations and staff role information.
Statistical Methods
In the prospective cohort analysis, we applied mixed-
effects Weibull regression analysis to model the rela-
tive hazard of the first emergency admission in relation 
to the level of continuity of care a patient experienced 
during follow-up, adjusting for the clustering due to 
the different practices wherein patients were regis-
tered. In the retrospective nested case-control analysis, 
we applied conditional logistic regression analysis to 
obtain odds ratios for having had an emergency hos-
pital admission in relation to the level of continuity of 
care a patient experienced.
RESULTS
Prospective Cohort Analysis 
Figure 1 shows that the distribution of BB index scores 
varied widely among the 8,248 patients in the prospec-
tive cohort analysis. Overall, 95 (1.1%) and 575 (6.9%) 
of patients never and always, respectively, saw the 
same general practitioner when visiting that physician’s 
practice, corresponding to continuity of care scores of 
0 and 1. As these patients consulted a general practi-
tioner less frequently (Supplementary Table 1, http://
www.annfammed.org/content/15/6/515/suppl/DC1), we 
adjusted for the number of general practitioner consul-
tations in analyses.
Table 1 shows the results of the mixed-effects 
Weibull regression model for unadjusted and adjusted 
associations between patients’ BB index score and risk 
of emergency hospital admission. In the unadjusted 
model, patients with less than perfect continuity of 
care (BB index score <1) experienced a higher inci-
dence of emergency hospital admission. A similar pat-
tern was seen after adjustment, although the higher 
incidence was statistically significant only for those 
with a BB index score of 0. When examining the trend

across the 6 categories of scores (1 = highest, 6 = low-
est) as discrete categories, the hazard ratio per each 
increasing category was 1.042 (95% CI, 0.997-1.090; 
P = .07). The practice average BB index score was not 
associated with a patient’s risk of 
an emergency hospital admission 
in either the unadjusted models 
or the adjusted models.
A sensitivity analysis with 
BB index scores divided into 
tertiles showed no significant 
association (Supplementary Table 
3, http://www.annfammed.org/
content/15/6/515/suppl/DC1).
Nested Case-Control Analysis
BB Index
Scores on the BB index varied 
widely among the 2,892 patients 
in the retrospective nested case-
control analysis (Supplementary 
Figure 4, http://www.annfammed.
org/content/15/6/515/suppl/
DC1). Almost 300 (9.8%) of the 
patients always saw the same 
general practitioner when visiting 
the practice, corresponding to a 
score of 1. Again, patients with 
a BB index score of 0 or 1 con-
sulted a general practitioner less 
frequently (Supplementary Table 
4, http://www.annfammed.org/
content/15/6/515/suppl/DC1).
Table 2 shows the results of 
the conditional regression model 
for unadjusted and adjusted asso-
ciations between the BB index 
score and risk of emergency hos-
pital admission. In the unadjusted 
model, there was an association 
between less than perfect con-
tinuity of care and higher odds 
of emergency hospital admis-
sion. A similar result was seen in 
the adjusted model, particularly 
showing higher odds among those 
with an index score of less than 
0.4. When analyzing the 6 BB 
index score categories as discrete 
scores (1 = highest, 6 = lowest), 
the associated odds ratio per each 
increase in category was 1.162 
(95% CI, 1.067-1.265; P = .001).
A sensitivity analysis with BB 
index scores divided into ter-
tiles showed that patients whose

scores were in the low and middle tertiles had odds 
ratios of 1.589 (95% CI, 1.212-2.084; P = .001) and 
1.304 (95% CI, 1.013-1.678; P = .04), respectively, when 
compared with counterparts whose index scores were 
in the high tertile (highest continuity), showing a gra-
dient of increasing risk of emergency hospital admis-
sion (Supplementary Table 6, http://www.annfammed.
org/content/15/6/515/suppl/DC1).
Appointed General Practitioner Index
Figure 2 shows that the distribution of the appointed 
general practitioner index scores also varied widely 
among patients included in the nested case-control 
analysis. Again, almost 300 patients always saw their 
appointed general practitioner (before admission or at 
the respective time point for control patients) when 
visiting the practice, corresponding to a score of 1. 
Patients with a low (first-quartile) index score had con-
sulted a general practitioner more often (Table 3). In 
the analysis, we therefore adjusted for number of gen-
eral practitioner consultations.
Table 4 shows the results of the conditional regres-
sion model for unadjusted and adjusted associations 
between the appointed general practitioner index score 
and odds of emergency hospital admission. The odds 
ratios for emergency hospital admission were higher 
for patients who did not see their appointed general 
practitioner every time they consulted the practice. 
This association was especially 
marked for those who saw their 
appointed general practitioner 
fewer than 4 out of 10 times 
in the adjusted model. When 
regarding the 5 categories of 
general practitioner index score 
as discrete categories (1 = highest, 
5 = lowest), the associated odds 
ratio per each increase in cat-
egory was 1.266 (95% CI, 1.161-
1.372; P <.001).
DISCUSSION
Principal Findings
Our results show that older 
patients who experienced more 
discontinuity of care in general 
practice had a higher risk of an 
emergency hospital admission.

continuity of care in general practice, whether assessed 
with the BB index score or the appointed general prac-
titioner index score, had significantly higher odds of 
this adverse outcome. Additionally, results obtained 
using the appointed general practitioner index suggest 
that an encounter with a general practitioner other 
than the appointed one was associated with increased 
risk of admission within 30 days. In the prospective 
cohort analysis and using the BB index score, the trend 
was in the same direction, although only patients with 
a score of 0 had a significantly higher risk of emer-
gency hospital admission.
Strengths and Limitations
Within the United Kingdom, patients are registered at 
a single general practice but may see different physi-
cians within that practice; therefore, this setting is ideal 
for studying the impact of continuity of care at the 
individual patient level. Our study used longitudinal 
individual-level data from older patients in the CPRD 
to assess continuity of care and its relationship with the 
incidence of unplanned admission, filling a methodo-
logic gap.34 We computed 2 commonly used types of 
longitudinal continuity of care 
measures for patients who had 
consulted a general practitio-
ner at least twice: the BB index 
score and the appointed general 
practitioner index score (in 
this study taken to be the last 
general practitioner seen before 
admission). Both indices showed 
high frequencies of 0 (worst 
possible continuity) and 1 (best 
possible continuity), partly 
attributable to low numbers of 
consultations by these patients, 
so we accordingly defined them 
as separate categories. We repeated analysis, instead 
dividing the whole distribution of scores by tertiles 
(Supplementary Tables 3 and 6), but saw essentially 
similar trends. By selecting the most recent general 
practitioner seen before hospitalization within the 
nested case-control analysis, we could have introduced 
potential for confounding by indication, as seeing a 
general practitioner other than the usual one may indi-
cate need for an urgent examination because of clinical 
deterioration rather than being causal. Furthermore, 
a longer observation period might have increased the 
number of patients with sufficient consultations to esti-
mate continuity of care, and might have reduced the 
number of patients having perfect continuity of care.
An advantage of this database, however, was that 
it allowed us to apply 2 study designs: a prospective 
cohort approach and a nested case-control approach. 
For this study, the nested case-control approach might 
be more appropriate for testing the impact of continu-
ity of care on emergency hospitalization as the last 
consultation with the general practitioner was within 
30 days of hospital admission. Furthermore, within the 
nested case-control analysis, we matched patients on

 CONTINUIT Y OF PRIMARY CARE

both individual factors, including age and time period 
of last general practitioner visit, and system-level fac-
tors (as we matched on general practitioner practice), 
thereby controlling for general practitioner staff 
composition, deprivation level, and alternative service 
availability such as out-of-hours care. By controlling 
for system-level factors, we eliminated the effect of 
local alternative primary care facilities.
Comparison With Existing Literature
Most previous UK studies of continuity have been 
ecological in nature, involving aggregated data at the 
practice level,11-15 meaning that associations cannot 
necessarily be applied to individual patients. The study 
of Barker et al10 was one of the first in the United King-
dom to link continuity of care and number of hospital 
admissions using individual-level data. Our study used 
individual-level longitudinal data, allowing a stronger 
basis for inferring a causal relationship between con-
tinuity of care and first emergency hospital admission 
between April 2012 and March 2014. Other recent 
individual-based studies investigating the relationship 
between continuity of care and hospitalization have 
come from Taiwan5-7 and have shown similar findings, 
although that country’s health care system is not com-
pletely comparable: Taiwan implemented compulsory 
health insurance in 1995 and has a health care system 
with less focus on the gatekeeper role of general prac-
titioners.35 These studies used measures of continuity 
of care similar to those we used, but excluded patients 
with only a few general practitioner consultations, 
which could introduce bias; additionally, 2 of the stud-
ies focused on diabetic patients alone. Furthermore, the 
outcomes in the Taiwanese studies included emergency 
department visits, avoidable hospitalizations, and hospi-
tal admissions in general. Those differences might limit 
comparability of their findings with ours, although they 
show the value of our work for the United Kingdom 
and considerations for future research.
Implications for General Practices and Future 
Research
We have assumed that avoiding hospitalization is ben-
eficial, consistent with results from the Dutch cohort 
study.36 As our study shows, older adults who experi-
enced marked discontinuity of care had an increased 
risk of emergency hospital admission. This finding 
might be highly relevant for policy makers because of 
increasing size of elderly populations.37 Discontinuity 
of care reduces the opportunity for building trust and 
mutual responsibility between patients and physicians, 
which might underlie the increased risk of emergency 
hospital admission.37 More qualitative and quantita-
tive research is needed, therefore, to understand the 
relationship between continuity of care and reasons for 
admission, and to understand patients’ values and expe-
riences of continuity of care.38 Distinguishing between 
general practitioner–referred emergency hospital admis-
sions and admissions through an emergency department 
requires a larger data set. Qualitative research might 
help us understand how, when, and why continuity of 
care influences health care use, shedding light on factors 
such as consultation skills of the general practitioner, 
physician knowledge of patients, patient trust in the 
physician and his/her abilities, and patient feelings of 
loyalty toward the physician.39-41 The introduction in 
2014 of a “named general practitioner” who is respon-
sible for the health care for each patient aged 75 and 
older offers the opportunity to investigate whether this 
intervention indeed has resulted in better longitudinal 
continuity of care and in reduced hospital admission.42
