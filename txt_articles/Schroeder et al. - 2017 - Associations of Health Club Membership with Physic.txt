Abstract
Introduction
This study evaluates whether a health club membership is associated with meeting the US
physical activity (PA) guidelines and/or favorable cardiovascular health.
Methods
Using cross-sectional data of health club members (n = 204) and non-members (n = 201)
from April to August 2013, this is the first study to our knowledge to examine a health club
membership in relation to objectively measured cardiovascular health indicators including
resting blood pressure, resting heart rate, body mass index, waist circumference, and
cardiorespiratory fitness based on a non-exercise test algorithm. To determine the total PA
and sedentary time, this study used a comprehensive PA questionnaire about both aerobic
and resistance activities at the health club, as well as lifestyle activities in other settings,
which was developed based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).
Results
The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of meeting either the aerobic, resistance, or both
aerobic and resistance PA guidelines for members compared to non-members were 16.5
(9.8–27.6), 10.1 (6.2–16.3), and 13.8 (8.5–22.4), respectively. Significant associations of
health club membership with more favorable cardiovascular health outcomes and sedentary
behavior were observed for resting heart rate (B: -4.8 b/min, p<0.001), cardiorespiratory fit-
ness (B: 2.1 ml/kg/min, p<0.001), and sedentary time (B: -1.4 hours, p<0.001). Participants
with a health club membership of >1 year had more favorable health outcomes, with a
smaller waist circumference (men, B: -4.0 cm, p = 0.04; women, B: -3.4 cm, p = 0.06), com-
pared to non-members.
Conclusions
Health club membership is associated with significantly increased aerobic and resistance
physical activity levels and more favorable cardiovascular health outcomes compared to
non-members. However, longitudinal, randomized controlled trials would be clearly war-
ranted as cross-sectional data prohibits causal inferences.

 Introduction
The United States Department of Health and Human Services has established specific goals to
increase the number of individuals who meet the current physical activity (PA) guidelines [1].
Current evidence-based physical activity guidelines (PAG) recommend at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, or an equiva-
lent combination of both [2]. The PAG also recommend participation in muscle-strengthening
activities on 2 or more days per week for additional health benefits not found with aerobic
activity [2]. However, most studies have focused on aerobic activity and more data are needed
regarding the distribution and determinants of muscle-strengthening activities such as resis-
tance exercise [3].
Despite the clear evidence of health benefits, approximately only half of Americans reported
meeting the aerobic PAG, and only 30% reported meeting the muscle-strengthening PAG in
2013 [4]. The prevalence of meeting aerobic PAG is even lower (<10%) when assessed with
objective measures of accelerometry [5]. These findings document the need for more effective
population based strategies for promoting PA. Many worksite wellness programs in developed
countries offer activity related programming with on-site exercise facilities [6]. Insurance cov-
erage for a health club membership has also become more common in the US, and many com-
panies even cover or subsidize the cost of health club memberships for their employees [6]. In
addition, there are numerous commercial programs and health club facilities positioned to
provide opportunities for PA promotion [7]. However, little is actually known about the
impact of these facilities on health as most previous research has focused on other determi-
nants of physical activity and sport [8–10]. One previous cross-sectional study has also simply
compared the exercise levels of individuals with and without a health club membership [11],
but no current literature has explored cardiovascular health in relation to health club member-
ship. Further, there is very limited data about the associations of health club membership status
and duration with the prevalence of meeting the current PAG (aerobic and/or muscle-
strengthening PAG) and sedentary time.
A specific and practical question that needs to be addressed is whether, and to what extent,
having a health club membership is associated with increased PA, higher fitness, and favorable
cardiovascular health. In addition, there is little evidence about whether having a health club
membership is associated with lifestyle PA outside health clubs or whether the duration of a
health club membership is associated with PA levels, fitness, and health. Therefore, the pur-
pose of this study was to determine the strength (magnitude) of the associations of the status
and duration of a health club membership with the likelihood of meeting the aerobic and/or
muscle-strengthening PAG, lifestyle PA levels, sedentary time, and cardiovascular health
outcomes.
Methods
Study Participants
This study included 424 participants in which 19 were excluded due to incomplete data. After
exclusions, 405 participants aged 30–64 years, who are expected to gain the most cardiovascu-
lar benefits from PA, remained for analyses. All participants were employed or residing in a
college town (Ames, IA) with a population of approximately 63,000 [12]. The sample consisted
of volunteer participants, who were predominantly white (85%), well-educated college faculty
and staff members. Recruitment occurred using various methods, including flyers, e-mail,
word of mouth, and in-person at the local college and 4 different commercial health clubs.
Most health club members were recruited using the college faculty and staff email list and local

 health clubs, and non-members were recruited from the college faculty and staff without a
health club membership. Participants were not on blood pressure medication (e.g., beta block-
ers) to minimize its effect on blood pressure and resting heart rate (main cardiovascular out-
comes); did not have a history of heart attack, stroke, or cancer; and were not currently
pregnant. We also collected personal history of physician-diagnosed diabetes, arthritis (rheu-
matoid or osteoarthritis), hypercholesterolemia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD), and depression. We adjusted for these common medical conditions that may
affect PA and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes in our analyses. However, we did not
exclude participants with these common, but less serious, medical conditions to increase gen-
eralizability of our study. Participants completed an evaluation including resting blood pres-
sure, resting heart rate, waist circumference, weight and height measurement, as well as a PA
and medical history questionnaire. Health club members were defined as those who reported
that they had at least 1 month of health/fitness club membership at the time of study participa-
tion. Non-members were defined as those who reported they had no health/fitness club mem-
bership over the last 3 months. Iowa State University Institutional Review Board approved the
study and all participants gave written informed consent.
Cardiovascular Health Outcomes
Resting blood pressure and heart rate were measured using an Omron automated digital mon-
itor (Omron BP760, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Lake Forest, IL) after at least a 10-minute seated
rest period, with measurements on the upper left, bared arm. A minimum of two measure-
ments were taken at intervals of at least 2 minutes, with additional measurements taken if a >5
mmHg difference occurred between the first and second reading in either systolic and/or dia-
stolic blood pressure. Hypertension was defined as systolic or diastolic blood pressure �140/
90 mmHg [13]. Increased resting heart rate was defined as a heart rate �80 b/min based on
studies indicating increased risks of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality [14,15]. Participants
recruited in the local health clubs completed resting blood pressure and heart rate measures
before their exercise in the health club.
Body mass index (BMI) was determined from measured weight and height (kg/m2) using a
standard stadiometer, and classified into 4 groups: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight
(18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2), or obese (�30 kg/m2) [16]. Waist circumfer-
ence (cm) was measured at the level of the umbilicus after exhalation. Abdominal obesity was
defined as a waist circumference of >102 cm for men and >88 cm for women [17].
Cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen consumption in mL/kg/min) was estimated
with a non-exercise algorithm incorporating age, BMI, waist circumference, resting heart rate,
PA, and smoking status, based on a large longitudinal study in over 11,000 middle-aged adults
[18]. This algorithm used to estimate a non-exercise testing cardiorespiratory fitness provides
a valid indication of CVD and disease-specific mortality [19]. Low fitness was defined as <10
and <8 METs for 30–39 year old men and women, <9 and <7 METs for 40–49 years, <8 and
<6 METs for 50–59 years, and <7 and <5 METs for �60 years, respectively, based on earlier
studies indicating higher risks of CVD and mortality in people with the corresponding fitness
levels [20,21]. Demographic variables, smoking status, alcohol consumption, dieting for weight
loss, and personal history of common chronic diseases were obtained from the medical history
question.
Physical Activity Measurement
Self-reported PA was assessed using a questionnaire developed based on the International
Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [22]. Using the basic IPAQ format, separate questions

 were developed to capture both the frequency and duration of moderate aerobic PA, vigorous
aerobic PA, and muscle-strengthening PA. Because the goal was to capture the association
between health club membership and activity patterns, distinctions were made about whether
the activity was performed in a health club setting or as part of their lifestyle using two separate
PA sections: 1) PA performed only in the health club and 2) lifestyle PA performed outside the
health club. Participants with a health club membership answered both health club and life-
style PA questions (including occupation, housework, transportation, and leisure-time activi-
ties) over the past 30 days. Participants without a health club membership answered only
lifestyle PA questions. Examples of health club aerobic activities included treadmill running or
cycling, and muscle-strengthening activities included weight lifting using free weights, weight
machines, or body weight (e.g., chin-ups or sit-ups). Examples of lifestyle aerobic activities
included outdoor running, sport activities, or house cleaning, and muscle-strengthening activ-
ities included push-ups, sit-ups, or carrying heavy loads. Additionally, two questions asked
about total sitting time on a typical week day and weekend day for all participants. Participants
who spent �6 hours sitting per day, on average, were defined as sedentary, which has been
identified as a CVD risk factor [23,24].
The items were scored, as follows, to compute overall activity levels and to determine com-
pliance with the PAG. To calculate the total minutes of aerobic activities, the frequency was
multiplied by the duration for each moderate and vigorous intensity activity, and summed
over all activities. The duration of vigorous aerobic activity was multiplied by two based on the
PAG, indicating that one minute of vigorous activity equals two minutes of moderate activity
[2]. Muscle-strengthening activity was calculated as sessions per week. Participants were classi-
fied as meeting or not meeting the aerobic and/or muscle-strengthening PAG based on their
total minutes of aerobic activities (�150 minutes/week) and frequency (�2 days/week) of
muscle-strengthening activities. The adaptations and scoring of the items are consistent with
IPAQ applications. There were significant Spearman correlation coefficients between total
minutes of PA from our questionnaire and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (r = 0.43,
p<0.001) and resting heart rate (r = -0.32, p<0.001). Significant relationships between PA lev-
els and these variables are generally expected, thus provide some potential support for validity
of our PA questionnaire.
Statistical Analyses
This was a cross-sectional study conducted between April and August 2013. All statistical anal-
yses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.3, SAS Institute Inc; Cary, NC). Descriptive
statistics for the two groups were compared using χ2 tests or t tests. Multivariable logistic and
linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the associations of health club membership
with PA and cardiovascular health outcomes, and are reported as odds ratio or beta coeffi-
cients (95% confidence intervals). Cardiovascular health outcome analyses were adjusted for
age, sex, dieting for weight loss, BMI, disease presence (COPD, asthma, arthritis, diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, or depression), smoking status (current or non-smoker), and heavy
alcohol consumption (>14 drinks/week for men, >7 drinks/week for women) [25]. All statisti-
cal tests were two-sided, and p<0.05 was accepted to indicate statistical significance.
Results
There were 204 participants with a health club membership and 201 participants without a
health club membership. Those with a health club membership were significantly more active
and less sedentary (Table 1). Regarding total PA, including both health club and lifestyle activi-
ties, 87% and 84% of members compared to 30% and 36% of non-members met the aerobic

 PAG and resistance PAG, respectively. The prevalence of meeting both aerobic and resistance
PAG was 75% in members and 18% in non-members in additional analysis. Those with a
health club membership were also more fit and had a lower resting heart rate (Table 2).
In logistic regression analyses (Table 3), the odds ratios (OR) (95% confidence interval
[CI]) of meeting PAG in health club members compared to non-members were 16.5 (9.8–

 27.6) for aerobic, 10.1 (6.2–16.3) for resistance, and 13.8 (8.5–22.4) for both PAG using total
PA (health club PA plus lifestyle PA) after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. However, there
were no significant differences in the odds of meeting the PAG when comparing only lifestyle
PA outside the health club between members and non-members (p>0.05). This result suggests
that health club members have similar, but not lower, PA levels outside their health clubs com-
pared to non-members. A significant linear trend (p<0.001) was observed for increasing dura-
tion of health club membership and meeting the PAG (Fig 1).
Table 4 shows the odds ratio of cardiovascular health outcomes in health club members
compared to non-members. Health club membership was associated with significantly lower
odds (OR, 95% CI) of elevated resting heart rate (0.5, 0.3–0.9) and obesity (0.6, 0.4–0.97) after
adjusting for potential confounders. Although not significant, individuals with a health club
membership also had lower odds of hypertension (0.7, 0.3–1.4) and abdominal obesity (men:
0.7, 0.3–1.4; women: 0.8, 0.5–1.5). Due to the small number of unfit participants (n = 4 in
members and n = 6 in non-members), cardiorespiratory fitness was not included in this analy-
sis. After further adjustment for total PA in additional analyses, the associations for all out-
comes were no longer significant, indicating the potential cardiovascular benefits of having a
health club membership are most possibly from increased PA, especially at the health club
(p>0.05). We further analyzed the data by removing individuals with a health club member-
ship for 1 year or less, under the assumption that they may not yet fully display the benefits of
PA. This analysis resulted in more robust relationships with lower odds (OR, 95% CI) of an

 elevated resting heart rate (0.4, 0.2–0.8), obesity (0.5, 0.3–0.9), and abdominal obesity (men:
0.5, 0.2–1.1; women: 0.7, 0.4–1.3).
In multivariable linear regression analysis, significant health benefits were found for indi-
viduals with a health club membership on resting heart rate, cardiorespiratory fitness, and
waist circumference (Table 5). Individuals with a health club membership had a 4.8 b/min
lower resting heart rate (B: -4.8, p<0.001) and 2.1 mL/kg/min higher cardiorespiratory fitness
(B: 2.1, p<0.001), after adjusting for the potential confounders. Removal of individuals with a
health club membership of 1 year or less resulted in more favorable findings in most outcomes,
especially waist circumference (men, B: -4.0 cm, p = 0.04; women, B: -3.4 cm, p = 0.06). How-
ever, statistical significance was lost after further adjustment for total PA in all outcomes
(p>0.05). Although not significant, individuals with a health club membership had lower sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure and lower BMI. In regards to PA, members spent approxi-
mately 5.8 hours/week (B: 5.8, p<0.001) being more aerobically active, 2.3 times/week (B: 2.3,
p<0.001) doing more muscle-strengthening PA, and 1.4 hours/day (B: -1.4, p<0.001) being
less sedentary, compared to non-members.
Discussion
The primary finding of this study is the significant associations of health club membership
with increased aerobic and resistance PA levels as well as favorable cardiovascular health

 outcomes including resting heart rate, cardiorespiratory fitness, and obesity measures. Addi-
tionally, an increased length of membership was more strongly associated with increased phys-
ical activity and favorable cardiovascular health outcomes.
Our findings are consistent with a previous cross-sectional study comparing fitness center
members and non-members in which fitness center members exercised more regularly (88%
of members compared to 54% of non-members), at higher intensities, and for longer periods
of time (64 minutes vs. 54 minutes per session, p<0.001) [11]. In our study, the number of
minutes of additional aerobic PA in the health club members (484 minutes/week) is drastically
larger than those without memberships (137 minutes/week) (Table 1). The difference between
the previous study and the current study may be related to differences in PA questionnaires
(e.g., more comprehensive questionnaire in our study vs. a simple 5-question Health-Promot-
ing Lifestyle Profile without information about muscle-strengthening activity and separate
comparison of health club and lifestyle PA), population (e.g., higher education levels in our
study), and study design (e.g., in-person data collection in our study vs. mailed
questionnaires).
Our study also investigated the association of health club membership with resistance PA.
In community-dwelling adults, meeting the resistance PAG is more challenging without access
to a health club, where various weight training equipment is typically available. Our study sug-
gests positive associations of a health club membership with meeting the resistance PAG, and
both aerobic and resistance PAG. Only 36% and 18% of non-members met resistance PAG
and both aerobic and resistance PAG, respectively, which greatly differs from the 84% and
75% of members meeting the respective guidelines. This results in 10 and 14 times higher odds
of meeting resistance PAG and both PAG, respectively, in members compared to non-mem-
bers (Table 3). However, due to the cross-sectional study design, it is also possible that active

 people may be more inclined to join a health club. Therefore, further prospective studies are
needed to investigate a causal relationship between health club membership and PA.
It may be expected that health club members would have lower amounts of other PA per-
formed at home, work, or during leisure-time outside their health club because they may feel
satisfied with their health club activities. However, our results show that health club members
had similar activity levels outside the health club compared to non-members. Thus, having a
health club membership does not appear to be associated with reduced lifestyle PA levels, but
only increased total PA.
In this study, favorable CVD health markers were observed in those with health club mem-
berships, such as lower resting heart rate, lower odds of being obese, increased cardiorespira-
tory fitness, and reduced sedentary time compared to non-members. However, we found that
these positive associations between health club memberships and favorable CVD markers
were no longer significant after further adjustment for total PA, which possibly indicates the
potential benefits of PA as a mediator between health club membership and favorable CVD
markers. This finding is supported by the current PAG, indicating health benefits of PA, such
as reduced risk of CVD, metabolic syndrome, high cholesterol, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and
functional impairment [20,26–28]. Our findings suggest that having a health club membership
may be an effective way to increase PA for cardiovascular health benefits. Unfortunately, only
18.2% of Americans have a health club membership [29]. Ideally more people with active
memberships would result in increased PA and more favorable health and fitness, as well as
reduced sedentary time, which is an important and independent emerging risk factor for car-
diovascular health and premature mortality [24,30,31]. Recent meta-analyses have suggested
that increased sedentary time (e.g., sitting, watching TV) is associated with increased risks of
type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hospitalization, and all-cause mortality regardless of
PA levels [23,31–33].
In this study, more favorable cardiovascular health outcomes were generally noted in health
club members, compared to non-members, after excluding health club members with �1 year
of health club membership (Tables 4 and 5). These findings possibly suggest that retaining a
health club membership is associated with accomplishing health goals, such as to lose weight or
lower blood pressure, as individuals who may have recently purchased a health club member-
ship may not have been physically active for an adequate duration to see the health benefits yet.
It is also possible that the PA performed at the health club is quite different from the lifestyle
PA outside the health club, which could contribute to the positive outcomes, although specific
activities were not collected in the current study. Many health clubs offer organized classes,
such as yoga, spinning, Pilates, etc., which have gained popularity. For instance, in 2013, one
in five health club members participated in yoga classes, followed in popularity by aerobics
and group cycling [29]. It is possible that this group exercise approach may create a synergy
about the class, bringing motivation and encouragement from other members, ultimately
resulting in greater PA in health club members. However, future studies and data are clearly
needed on this topic.
Limitations
The results should be interpreted with caution as cross-sectional data prohibits causal infer-
ences, thus it is also possible that more active individuals purchase health club memberships.
However, to examine more long term prospective associations between health club member-
ship and PA, fitness, and cardiovascular health, we included health club members with at least
1 month of membership, and investigated whether a longer duration of membership is associ-
ated with those outcome variables. The majority of study participants were white (85%), well-

 educated university faculty and staff, recruited from Ames, Iowa from April to August, and
unfortunately markers of socioeconomic status such as annual income were not collected.
Therefore, results may vary in other populations in different places during different seasons of
the year, and may be affected by socioeconomic status. Additionally, the use of self-reported
PA may introduce measurement error. However, people generally over report their PA, and
this over-reporting underestimates the true health effects of PA. Therefore, future studies
using an objective measure of PA in the health club would strengthen the associations between
health club membership and cardiovascular health outcomes. In addition, further studies are
needed to investigate the effects of the patterns of change in health club membership status on
PA and cardiovascular health outcomes using multiple assessments for those variables over
time. Another limitation is that we measured waist circumference at the umbilicus level instead
of midway between the lowest ribs and the iliac crest, which is clinically more recommended.
Therefore, the result on waist circumference should be carefully interpreted and applied.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study suggests that health club membership was associated with increased
PA and more favorable CVD health markers, especially with longer duration of membership.
With the declining average monthly fee for health club membership [29] and the increasing
support from employers and insurance companies, this study supports that promoting PA at a
health club could be an effective public health strategy for health promotion and potentially
health care cost reduction. However, large longitudinal, randomized controlled trials are
clearly warranted to confirm our findings.
