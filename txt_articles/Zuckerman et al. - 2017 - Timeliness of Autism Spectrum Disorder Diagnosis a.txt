Abstract
Objective—This study assessed the relationship of timeliness of ASD diagnosis with current use 
of ASD-related services in a nationally-representative sample of U.S. children.
Methods—The CDC’s Survey of Pathways to Diagnosis and Services was used to assess 
experiences of 722 children age 6–11 with ASD. Bivariate and multivariate associations between 
age and delay in ASD diagnosis and use of health services were explored. Older age of diagnosis 
was defined as diagnosis at age 4 years or older. Delay in diagnosis was defined as time ≥2 years 
between first discussion of concerns with provider and ASD diagnosis. Health services included 
current use of behavioral intervention therapy (BI), school-based therapy, complementary/
alternative medicine (CAM), and psychotropic medications.
Results—Mean age of ASD diagnosis was 4.4 years, and mean diagnostic delay was 2.2 years. 
On adjusted analysis, diagnosis at ≥4 years old was associated with lower likelihood of current BI 
or school-based therapy use. Diagnosis at ≥4 years old was also associated with higher likelihood 
of current psychotropic medication use. Likelihood of current psychotropic medication use 
increased with older age of ASD diagnosis. A ≥2 year delay in diagnosis was associated with 
higher likelihood of current CAM use. Likelihood of current CAM use increased as delay in 
diagnosis got longer.
Conclusions—Both older age of diagnosis and longer delay in diagnosis were associated with 
different health services utilization patterns among younger children with ASD. Prompt and early 
diagnosis may be associated with increased use of evidence-based therapies for ASD.

 Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by 
atypical social communication and interaction, coupled with restricted and/or repetitive 
behaviors and interests (1). ASD is common, affecting one in 68 U.S. children (2). Signs of 
ASD usually develop in the first two years of life (3, 4). Though diagnosis can usually be 
made by age two, average U.S. age of diagnosis is over four years (2). Delay between 
emergence of signs and ASD diagnosis is noteworthy because early intensive treatments 
may have long-term benefits for child functioning and family life (5–8).
Primary care providers (PCPs) are essential to early ASD detection, since they are in 
frequent contact with parents during a child’s first years. Nonetheless, some PCPs give false 
reassurance (9) or fail to direct families to diagnostic resources when valid parental concerns 
exist (10, 11). Although major pediatric organizations recommend routine ASD screening 
(12, 13), only around half of PCPs screen for ASD (14–16). Even when screening occurs, 
delays between initial conversations with providers and ASD diagnosis are common. Delays 
may relate to lack of family knowledge about ASD and the healthcare system, disability 
stigma, health- and educational-system communication or authorization difficulties, long 
waiting periods for evaluations, and geographic or transportation barriers (17–19).
When concerns for ASD exist, a child can be referred for treatment services. Some services 
target core ASD features (e.g., promoting social skills, reducing inflexible behaviors). Other 
services address ASD comorbidities (e.g., attentional problems, anxiety) (20). ASD-related 
service use varies by type (e.g., occupational therapy, prescribed medication) and amount 
(e.g., hours of services per week, medication dose) (21). There is no “best” combination of 
therapy for ASD in early childhood; however, behavioral intervention (BI) therapy directed 
at core ASD symptoms has strongest evidence of effectiveness (6–8). Other therapies, such 
as sensory integration therapy, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches 
and/or psychopharmacological treatments for ASD are more controversial (8, 22, 23).
Service use may correspond with timeliness of ASD diagnosis. For instance, it is possible 
that families experiencing long ASD diagnostic delays are more likely to use CAM, 
especially CAM that is easily purchased (e.g., supplements). Families may experience 
delays due to misdiagnosis (24), and therefore may use therapy or pharmacological 
treatments for other conditions (e.g., ADHD). Timeliness of diagnosis may affect families’ 
use of government-funded services (e.g., Part C Early Intervention) that depend on the 
child’s age (25). As pediatric organizations press for early ASD identification (12) it is 
important to determine whether timely diagnosis is associated with subsequent ASD-related 
service use. Thus, this study aimed to assess the relationship between ASD diagnostic age 
and delay with current health services use in a nationally-representative sample.

 Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) (26), a nationally-
representative, parent-reported telephone survey of CSHCN according to the CSHCN 
Screener (27, 28). NS-CSHCN’s response rate was 25.5% (29). Parents whose children had 
ASD, intellectual disability (ID) and/or developmental delay (DD) in the NS-CSHCN and 
were age 6–17 in 2011 were re-contacted to participate in Pathways. Pathways had a 
telephone and written component; this analysis only concerns the telephone component. 
71% of eligible families were successfully re-contacted, and 87% of those agreed to 
participate in Pathways (N=4,032) (30). Methodology of NS-CSHCN and Pathways has 
been described and is available on the National Center for Health Statistics’ website (27, 29, 
30).
In Pathways, we assessed experiences of elementary school-aged children (6–11 years) with 
current ASD. Children with ID and/or DD but not ASD, and children with past but not 
current ASD were excluded (N=2,098). Children age ≥12 (N=698) were excluded due to 
fewer ASD treatment guidelines in this group and recall bias concerns (e.g., parents of 
adolescents with ASD may not remember child’s diagnosis age). The survey was approved 
by the National Center for Health Statistics’ Institutional Review Board.
Variables
This study used two measures of timely ASD diagnosis. The first (“Age of ASD Diagnosis”) 
was based on responses to: “How old was your child when you were first told [s/he] had 
autism or autism spectrum disorder [by a healthcare provider]?” The second measure 
(“Delay in ASD Diagnosis”) was calculated as the difference in child age between when a 
parent “first talked with a doctor or healthcare provider about [developmental] concerns” 
and the age of ASD diagnosis. Since Pathways recorded age in months up to 36 months and 
in years thereafter, we standardized Age of ASD Diagnosis and Delay in ASD Diagnosis 
values to years by rounding to whole completed years (e.g., 6 months or 11 months=0 years; 
15 months or 23 months=1 year). We rounded for three reasons: first, most parents of 
children >36-months would likely also do so (e.g., parents would report a child who is three 
years and 10 months old as age 3, not age 4). Rounding also kept age measurements uniform 
across ages, which is critical since many time intervals we examined spanned the 36-month 
time-point. Finally, rounding accounted for parents having difficulty remembering the exact 
month of events that occurred years prior.
Analyses treated age and delay outcomes as both dichotomous and continuous variables. In 
dichotomous analyses, older ASD diagnosis age was defined as ≥4 years based on mean 
sample diagnosis age (4.4 years). Also, clinically it would be possible to diagnose most 
children with ASD by age four (2). We similarly defined longer ASD diagnostic delay as ≥2 
years between age of first provider conversation and diagnosis. We dichotomized delay at 
two years based on mean sample delay (2.2 years). Also, clinically this would be a long 
delay regardless of when parents initially expressed concerns: in most cases early signs of 
ASD are present by age two (31–33). In analyses where age or delay was treated as 
continuous, the variable was considered in whole years only.
Child and family factors previously associated with age of ASD diagnosis and ASD-related 
health services utilization served as covariates (34, 35). Factors included child age, gender,

 race/ethnicity, health insurance type, functional limitations status, household income relative 
to federal poverty level (FPL), parent education, census region, and family structure. FPL 
was defined in 2011 as $22,350 per family of four (36). Insurance was categorized as “any 
private insurance” or “public only or uninsured,” as many children had both private and 
public insurance and only 16 were uninsured. Functional limitations status, a sensitive 
indicator of elevated health services use, was used as a severity marker (37), and was defined 
as an affirmative response to the CSHCN Screener functional limitations items (e.g., “child 
is limited in any way in his/her ability to do things most children of the same age can do” 
due to “any medical, behavioral, or other health condition that is expected to has lasted or is 
expected to last 12 months or longer”) (28).
We studied four measures of ASD-related health services use; each has previously varied 
among children with ASD (35, 38, 39) and/or related conditions (40). Psychotropic 
medication use was identified if the child was taking any psychotropic medication “to meet 
his/her developmental needs” currently on a regular basis, including stimulants, 
antidepressants, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, anti-seizure medications, antipsychotics, and 
sleep medications. BI use was defined as whether the child was using “behavioral 
intervention or modification services to meet his/her developmental needs” at least once per 
week currently on a regular basis. CAM use was defined as whether the child currently used 
“any type of alternative healthcare or treatment to meet his/her developmental needs” on a 
regular basis. School-based therapy use was defined as whether the child used social skills 
training, occupational, physical or speech/language therapy at school, currently on a regular 
basis.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were computed, assessing sample socio-demographic characteristics. 
Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions of children receiving the four ASD health 
services (psychotropic medications, BI, CAM, and school-based therapy) by socio-
demographic characteristics.
To examine primary outcomes, chi-square tests were computed, comparing proportions of 
children receiving each of the health services, in children with older (≥4 years) versus 
younger (<4 years) diagnostic age, as well as longer (≥2 years) versus shorter (<2 years) 
diagnostic delay (Table 2). Logistic regression models were fit to examine unadjusted and 
adjusted associations between diagnostic age and delay with use of the four health services, 
controlling for all child and family covariates. Logit models were fit to examine ASD 
diagnostic age and delays as continuous variables in association with the four health 
services, controlling for the same covariates (Table 4). Sensitivity analyses tested if the 
interaction between diagnostic age and delay modified associations with health services use. 
Analyses additionally examined if the relationship of ASD diagnostic age and delay with 
services use was modified by length of ASD diagnosis (i.e., difference between child age of 
ASD diagnosis and child age when surveyed), by functional limitations status, or by 
comorbid ID diagnosis. Analyses were performed in Stata 13.1 (College Station, Texas), 
using survey weights to account for Pathways’ complex sampling design.

 Results
Of 722 households meeting inclusion criteria, mean child age was 8.9 years. Most children 
(73%) were White non-Hispanic, privately insured (69%), and above 200% FPL (65%). 63% 
of children had functional limitations (Table 1). On average, parents first discussed 
developmental concerns with a provider when the child was 2.1 years old. Mean ASD 
diagnosis age was 4.4 years, leading to a mean diagnostic delay of 2.2 years (Figure 1). 
School-based therapy was the most frequently used health service (79%). 49% of children 
used psychotropic medications, 32% used BI, and 16% used CAM (Table 2).
When ASD diagnosis age was dichotomized at four years, bivariate and multivariable 
analyses showed significant associations with psychotropic medication, BI, and school-
based therapy use. The strongest association was with school-based therapy use: children 
with older ASD diagnosis age had lower odds of current school-based therapy use versus 
children with younger diagnosis age (72% of children diagnosed at ≥4 versus 90% of 
children diagnosed at <4 years; adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=.38, 95% confidence interval 
[CI]=.18–.83). BI use was also less likely among children diagnosed at older ages (25% 
versus 44%, aOR=.55, CI=.31–.97). Psychotropic medication use was more likely among 
children diagnosed at older ages (60% versus 31%; aOR=3.09, CI=1.77–5.39; Tables 2 and 
3).
When ASD diagnosis age was treated as continuous in multivariable models, there was a 
positive association between increasing age of diagnosis and psychotropic medication use 
(p=.001). There was a marginal negative association between diagnosis age and BI use (p=.
07), and no significant associations with CAM or school-based therapy use (Table 4).
ASD diagnostic delay had a different effect on services use than did ASD diagnosis age. 
CAM use, which had no significant associations with diagnosis age, was nearly twice as 
common among children with longer versus shorter delays (21% versus 11%; aOR=2.81, 
CI=1.50–5.73). When diagnostic delay was treated as continuous, there was a significant 
association with CAM use: as diagnostic delay increased, the likelihood of current CAM use 
increased (p=.009). Psychotropic medication use had a significant positive bivariate 
association with diagnostic delay, but was of borderline significance (p=.063) in 
multivariable results, and was non-significant when delay was treated as continuous.
We considered whether the relationship between diagnostic delay and services receipt was 
affected by functional limitations status and found that as diagnostic delay increased, 
children with functional limitations became significantly less likely than children without 
functional limitations to receive school-based therapy (p=.04) (Supplemental Figure 1).
Interaction between diagnosis age and delay did not modify services use; that is, the 
relationship between diagnosis age and services use was not significantly different among 
those with shorter versus longer diagnostic delays. There was a significant negative 
interaction between diagnostic delay and ASD diagnosis length according to BI use: as both 
length of ASD diagnosis and diagnostic delay increased, likelihood of current BI use 
decreased among children. There were no significant interactions between diagnosis age and

 functional limitations, comorbid ID and diagnosis age, or comorbid ID and diagnostic delay 
in terms of subsequent services use.
Discussion
This study’s goal was to investigate whether timeliness of ASD diagnosis was associated 
with subsequent ASD-related health services use. Since both early and prompt ASD 
diagnosis are important public health goals (36), we considered timeliness of ASD diagnosis 
in two ways: if the child was diagnosed at a younger (versus older) age, and if the child 
experienced a longer (versus shorter) diagnostic delay. Results suggested children diagnosed 
at older ages were less likely to currently use ASD-related therapy services and were more 
likely to take psychotropic medication, compared to children diagnosed at younger ages. 
Results also suggested children experiencing longer diagnostic delays were more likely to 
use CAM compared to children experiencing shorter delays. Since analyses controlled for 
current age and functional limitations status, differences are unlikely to be related to age 
cohort effects or lower ASD severity among children with late or delayed diagnoses. In fact, 
results revealed children with ASD and functional limitations may be especially likely to 
receive no therapy services when diagnosis is delayed.
Though the optimal type and amount of ASD therapy remains unclear, there is growing 
consensus that early therapy benefits children and families (41). It is therefore concerning 
that nearly a quarter of the elementary school-aged children studied were receiving no 
school-based therapy, and over half were not receiving BI. When we considered the 
approximately 50% of children who were ≥4 years at diagnosis, current therapy use was 
even lower. Instead, children diagnosed at older ages were more likely to receive 
psychotropic medications, which generally do not treat core ASD features. Similarly, 
children with long diagnostic delays were more likely to use CAM. Children with long 
delays and functional limitations (who may have the greatest therapy needs) had some of the 
lowest rates of school-based therapies. Together, these results suggest families who receive 
later ASD diagnoses are less likely use evidence-based therapy directed at core ASD 
symptoms and more likely to use alternative treatments, especially when a child is 
significantly impaired.
These findings should interest providers and policymakers. Previous research has indicated 
most parents delay only a few months before talking to providers about developmental 
concerns; however, substantial delays occur after initial provider conversations (10). This 
study adds to the literature by suggesting ASD diagnostic delays are also associated with 
long-term treatment differences. Results suggest that if long-term ASD therapy use is a 
priority, payers and policymakers may need to proactively accelerate diagnosis by 
incentivizing screening or enhancing case management of children at high risk for diagnostic 
delays. From a population standpoint, as children receive earlier ASD diagnoses, payers may 
expect changes in service use patterns toward more therapy use and less pharmacology.
Though ASD diagnostic delays may play a causal role in subsequent services use, alternative 
explanations of study findings are plausible. For instance, families who receive a delayed 
diagnosis may be less connected to the healthcare system for a number of reasons (e.g., 
Zuckerman et al.

 skepticism about effectiveness of conventional care, financial or geographic barriers to 
accessing care), making them less likely to seek conventional services and more likely to 
pursue CAM. Even if one were to assume later diagnosis causes subsequent decreased 
conventional service use, the mechanism whereby that occurs is unclear. Pathways did not 
collect information about what therapy services parents were offered, why parents chose or 
rejected any particular services, or whether current services were specifically for ASD 
versus some other developmental/behavioral problem. Parents’ beliefs about ASD may play 
a role in subsequent treatment decisions (35, 42); research exploring parents’ beliefs 
regarding treatment or longitudinal studies following families’ treatment decisions may 
elucidate these findings. Future research should explore why children were using certain 
therapies at high rates (e.g., psychotropic medications which are not generally indicated for 
ASD).
The study has other limitations. Pathways is based on parent report; consequently, ASD 
diagnoses were not verified. Few data exist regarding validity of parent-reported ASD 
diagnoses; however, national parent-reported surveys have produced prevalence estimates 
similar to studies that used more rigorous methods of ASD verification (2). There was no 
way to validate type or frequency of service use, although studies have revealed parents to be 
reliable sources of medication and health service use in typically-developing children (43–
46). Recall bias may also limit findings: parents may have had difficulty recalling the timing 
of their first conversation with a provider about developmental concerns or timing ASD 
diagnosis. To limit recall bias and account for imprecise date reporting, this study reported 
age in years and assessed only elementary school-aged children. Nonetheless, correlations 
found in the data may be due to biases in parent reporting rather than true associations (e.g., 
perhaps parents who report earlier ASD diagnoses also more often report certain details 
about their child’s current therapy compared to other parents). Also, since the study rounded 
age and delay to whole completed years, findings may underestimate diagnosis age and 
diagnostic delay for some children.
This study focused on children with ASD, regardless of comorbid ID and/or DD. Children 
with ASD and comorbid ID and DD may have use different services than other children with 
ASD (21). Sensitivity analyses did not suggest these were salient to the studied outcomes. 
We used child current functional status as a covariate in models to adjust for confounding by 
severity; however, current functional status may have differed from functional status at time 
of initial provider conversation and/or ASD diagnosis. Finally, the sample from Pathways 
and the NS-CSHCN could be subject to non-response bias from either survey.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study indicating that children diagnosed with ASD at 
older ages or after longer delays use different health services than other children with ASD. 
Results suggest children with diagnostic delays or older diagnosis age were least likely to 
use conventional ASD therapy and were most likely to use alternate treatments such as 
medication or CAM. Results also suggest efforts to increase early ASD diagnosis may result 
in greater ASD-related therapy use and improved functional outcomes for children with 
ASD.
