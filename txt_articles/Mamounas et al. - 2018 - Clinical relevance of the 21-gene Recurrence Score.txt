Clinical relevance of the 21-gene Recurrence Score® assay in
treatment decisions for patients with node-positive breast
cancer in the genomic era

In contemporary management of early-stage breast cancer, clinical decisions regarding adjuvant systemic therapy are increasingly
made after considering both genomic assay results and clinico-pathologic features. Genomic information augments the prognostic
information gleaned from clinico-pathologic features by providing risk estimates for distant recurrence and/or breast cancer-
specific survival based on individual tumor biology. The 21-gene Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score® (RS) assay is validated to be
prognostic and predictive of chemotherapy benefit in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative early-stage
breast cancer, regardless of nodal status. Because patients frequently are recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy based
on the perceived poor prognosis related to a positive nodal status, inconsistent use of any prognostic genomic assay in the node-
positive (N+) setting likely results in overtreatment of some patients, particularly those with a low genomic risk as defined by the RS
test. This comprehensive review of the evidence for the RS assay in patients with N+, HR+, HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer
focuses on outcomes of patients with low RS results treated with hormonal therapy alone. Aggregate findings show that the RS
assay consistently identifies patients with low genomic risk N+ breast cancer, in whom adjuvant chemotherapy can be avoided
without adversely affecting outcomes. This evidence suggests that HR+ patients with limited nodal involvement and low RS results
should discuss with their physicians the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy at the time their treatment plans are being
decided.

INTRODUCTION
Whether to use adjuvant chemotherapy is an important decision
that clinicians and patients face following diagnosis of invasive
breast cancer and the completion of primary surgical treatment. In
the absence of tumor-specific genomic information, systemic
adjuvant treatment decisions largely rely on prognostic informa-
tion gleaned from clinical and pathologic features of the patient
and tumor. Younger patient age, larger tumor size, higher tumor
grade, and positive nodal status are each associated with poorer
prognosis, including the higher risk of distant recurrence, with
lymph node status being the strongest contributor.1–3 In addition,
positive hormone receptor status and HER2 status are both
prognostic and predictive of treatment response.4,5 Patients with
high-risk clinico-pathologic features—such as positive nodal
status—are
generally
recommended
to
receive
adjuvant
chemotherapy.
Previous clinical trials in hormone receptor-positive (HR+),
HER2-negative, node-positive (N+) breast cancer showed that
chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy yielded better outcomes
than hormonal therapy alone.6–8 In a meta-analysis, the Early
Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) showed that
this benefit of chemotherapy is largely independent of age, nodal
status, tumor differentiation, or estrogen receptor (ER) level. The
meta-analysis, however, was unable to demonstrate the propor-
tional benefit of chemotherapy in those patients with ER+, HER2-
negative invasive breast cancer.7 With these findings, one cannot
assign an even proportional risk reduction for chemotherapy
across all prognostic groups. These observations indicate that the
prognostic power of nodal status has a limit in the capacity to
predict chemotherapy benefit, and that population-level prog-
nostication and treatment benefit will not relate to the prognosis
and treatment benefit expected for an individual patient. There-
fore, universal treatment of patients with HR+, HER2-negative, N
+breast cancer with adjuvant chemotherapy may represent
overtreatment for many.
The advent of genomic assays for use in ER+ early breast cancer
has accelerated a functional understanding of the disease. Results
of assays providing prognostic genomic information have been
accepted as complementary to other prognostic information, as
evidenced by the incorporation of genomic assays into clinical
practice

Importantly, the risk of distant recurrence and/or breast cancer-
specific mortality (BCSM) estimated by genomic assays is based on
tumor biology, thereby individualizing prognostication to the level
of the patient.
The 21-gene Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score® (RS) test
(Genomic Health, Inc.; Redwood City, CA) is an RT-PCR-based test
that measures the activity of 21 genes (16 cancer-related; 5
reference).15 The test generates a Recurrence Score® result that
represents an individualized estimate of risk of distant recurrence

adjuvant chemotherapy benefit.18–20 The cumulative findings of
the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)
B-20, the Trial Assigning IndividuaLized Options for Treatment
(TAILORx), and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S8814 trials
have shown that there is a clear interaction between chemother-
apy benefit and the 21-gene test.18–20 These findings have
demonstrated a lack of benefit of chemotherapy when added to
endocrine therapy for patients with low RS results and a
substantial benefit for those women with high RS results.18–20
Although the 21-gene test is considered the standard-of-care in
the HR+, HER2-negative, node-negative setting to guide adjuvant
chemotherapy decisions,9–14 it is not as uniformly utilized in the N
+ setting.11,21 There exists a discordance in practice guidelines in
N+ breast cancer that stems from a differing emphasis on levels of
evidence and timing of the guideline group publications. This has
resulted in a lack of uniform acceptance of the available genomic
assays in the US by insurance companies and internationally by
health policies in different countries. The lack of access to
genomic assays, and specifically the 21-gene test will likely result
in the overtreatment of many patients, namely, those with tumors
that are biologically unlikely to respond to chemotherapy. Here,
we present a summary of the large body of evidence supporting
the clinical value of the 21-gene test to guide systemic adjuvant
treatment decisions in patients with HR+, HER2-negative, N+
breast cancer. We focus on studies that included at least one
cohort that received hormonal therapy only in order to assess
outcomes of patients with low RS results who received no
adjuvant chemotherapy.
SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE FOR THE RS TEST IN HR+, HER2-
NEGATIVE, N+ BREAST CANCER
Five studies are considered in this review. Two are validation
studies that used a prospective-retrospective design,16,18,22 one is
an outcomes-based, prospectively designed clinical trial,23–26 and
two are population-based registries that followed patient out-
comes in a prospective manner.27–29 Descriptions of the studies
included in the review are shown in Table 1.
The distribution of patients across RS groups in each study is
shown in Fig. 1. Among the four studies that used standard RS cut-
offs (RS <18, 18–30, ≥31), the single largest RS group was the RS
<18 group. The PlanB study used non-standard RS cut-offs (RS
<12, 12–25, >25), and the largest group in this study was the RS
12–25 group. The RS result distribution shows that a considerable
proportion of patients have low-risk genomic signature breast
cancer despite positive nodal status.
Validation of prognostic utility of the RS test in HR+, HER2-
negative, N+ breast cancer
The transATAC was a prospectively planned translational study of
archival samples from the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in
Combination (ATAC) trial, in which postmenopausal patients with
invasive breast cancer were randomized to anastrozole, tamoxifen,
or the combination.16,30 The purpose of the transATAC study was
to determine whether the RS result provided independent
information on the risk of distant recurrence in the two
monotherapy arms of ATAC. Of 9366 patients enrolled in the
parent ATAC trial, 1231 tumor samples from the two monotherapy
arms were evaluable in the transATAC study, including 306 sam-
ples from patients with HR+, HER2-negative, N+ breast cancer (N
= 243 with 1–3N+; N = 63 with ≥4N+). The risk of distant
recurrence among patients with N+ breast cancer (N = 306)
differed significantly by RS group: mean 9-year risk of distant
recurrence was 17% with RS <18, 28% with RS 18–30, and 49%
with RS ≥31 (p < 0.001; Table 2) (unfortunately, the 9-year risk of
distant recurrence was not provided in numerical form for those
with 1–3N+ vs. ≥4N+). For any RS result, the risk of distant
recurrence was found to be higher for patients with ≥4N+ than
with 1–3N+. Notably, patients with 1–3N+ breast cancer and low
RS results had estimates of 9-year risk of distant recurrence that
were comparable to those of patients with node-negative breast
cancer.16
The prospective West German Study Group (WSG) PlanB trial
was designed to assess the difference in disease-free survival (DFS)
for women with HER2-negative, high-risk lymph node-negative, or
lymph node-positive breast cancer using an anthracycline or a
non-anthracycline adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. A total of
3198 women were enrolled in the trial. An early amendment
resulted in the testing of all patients with ER+ breast cancer who
had node-negative or 1–3N+ disease.26,31 Those with ER+, pN0 or
pN1 disease, and RS <12 received endocrine therapy only (after a
protocol amendment) and those with RS ≥12 were randomized to
one of two chemotherapy regimens. Of 404 patients with RS <12,
348 (86%) received hormonal therapy only. Of the 348 women
who received endocrine therapy alone, 110 had HR+, HER2-
negative, pN1 breast cancer (Table 2). The endpoints of the trial
included the prospective evaluation of the prognostic impact of
RS results at a follow-up target of 5 years. The clinical outcomes
included DFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with RS <12

 treated with endocrine therapy alone. The 5-year DFS in those
patients treated with endocrine therapy alone was 94.2% for
patients with pN0 and 94.4% in patients with pN1 breast cancer. In
a multivariable analysis, fractionally ranked RS result was a
significant independent predictor of poorer DFS (p = 0.001), along
with ≥4N+ breast cancer, tumor grade 3, and tumor size >2 cm. A
more recent analysis of the PlanB study showed that 5-year distant
disease-free survival (DDFS) was 97.9% for patients with 1–3N+
breast cancer and RS <12 who had endocrine therapy alone.24
Nodal status, grade, and RS results were independently prognostic
of DDFS in multivariable analysis. Results of the PlanB study
confirm the prognostic utility of the RS test among patients with
HR+, HER2-negative, N+ breast cancer, although this study used
non-standard RS cut-offs of 12 and 25.23,24,26,31 (These non-
standard cut-offs are similar those used in other prospective
clinical studies of the 21-gene test, including TAILORx and
RxPONDER; see below.)32,33
Validation of predictive utility of the 21-gene test in HR+, HER2-
negative, N+ breast cancer
Prediction of treatment benefit is demonstrated if an interaction
exists between the magnitude of treatment effect and the value/
level of a biological variable or gene (or a combination thereof).
Testing for such an interaction requires that at least two groups
(e.g., two arms of a randomized trial) be available for compar-
ison.34 This type of analysis was done in a prospectively planned
retrospective translational study of tumor samples from the SWOG
S8814 trial to test whether a difference in outcome from
randomized treatment (tamoxifen alone vs. chemotherapy fol-
lowed by tamoxifen) depended on the RS result.18 The benefit of
chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen was found to depend on
the RS result: patients with RS ≥31 had significantly better DFS
with chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen than with tamoxifen
alone (hazard ratio = 0.59; stratified log rank p = 0.03; Table 2).
DFS was not significantly different for patients with RS <18 who
did or did not have chemotherapy. Interaction of chemotherapy
benefit with linear RS result was tested, adjusting for number of
positive nodes, and was significant over the first 5 years of follow-
up (interaction p = 0.03). The benefit of chemotherapy (cyclopho-
sphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF)) was maintained
over the entire follow-up period. The test for interaction remained

 significant after adjustment for age, ethnic origin, tumor size,
progesterone receptor status, grade, and TP53 and HER2 levels by
immunohistochemistry. A similar significant interaction of treat-
ment with RS results was also found for both the breast cancer-
specific survival (BCSS) and OS endpoints.18 For BCSS, there was
no benefit to CAF in the low or intermediate RS groups; however,
for high RS results, 10-year point estimates were 73% for CAF
followed by tamoxifen vs. 54% for tamoxifen alone (stratified log-
rank p = 0.03). Of note, similar to the findings in NSABP B-20 in
node-negative disease,19 patients with the lowest RS results had
numerically worse outcomes with CAF followed by tamoxifen than
with tamoxifen alone.
The SWOG S8814 analysis showed that the RS result identifies a
group significantly more likely to benefit from chemotherapy.
These data represent the strongest evidence available thus far that
a genomic assay, namely, the 21-gene test, predicts chemotherapy
benefit in HR+, HER2-negative, N+ patients, because the study
was prospectively planned to examine this association and was
applied to a randomized phase 3 trial with an endocrine therapy-
alone arm. The finding of no benefit to chemotherapy in the low
RS group was true regardless of the number of positive nodes. In
other words, although increasing numbers of positive nodes
indeed portend a worse prognosis, the biology predicted by low
RS
results
mandates
that
endocrine
therapy
plus
non-
chemotherapy-based approaches should be pursued in this group
of patients to optimize survival.
Population-based registry reports of outcomes among patients
with HR+, HER2-negative, N+ breast cancer treated in routine
practice according to RS results
The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of
the National Cancer Institute is an authoritative source of cancer
incidence and survival statistics that covers about 30% of the
United States population.35 In an initial SEER analysis that included
4691 patients with HR+, HER2-negative, N+ breast cancer
(defined as micrometastases and 1–3N+) who had RS results,
the 5-year estimates of BCSM were significantly different by RS
group (p < 0.001): 1.0% with RS <18, 2.3% with RS 18–30, and
14.3% with RS ≥31 (Table 3). Adjuvant chemotherapy was
reportedly used by 23, 47, and 75% of patients with RS <18, RS
18–30, and RS ≥31, respectively.27 A later analysis that included an
additional year of follow-up in the SEER registries (N = 6768
patients with micrometastastic, 1–3N+, or ≥4N+ breast cancer)
confirmed initial findings in the N+ SEER patient population. In
particular, 5-year BCSS was 99.1% for patients with RS <18 and
micrometastases or 1N+, for whom reported chemotherapy use
ranged from 18 to 23%.28
Findings from a registry of the Clalit Health Services (CHS), the
largest health maintenance organization in Israel, corroborate
those of the SEER registry in the US. A CHS registry study
examined the relationship between RS results, adjuvant treatment,
and outcomes among 709 patients with HR+, HER2-negative, N+
breast cancer (micrometastases and 1–3N+). Among the subset
with RS <18 who received no adjuvant chemotherapy (N = 342), 5-
year distant recurrence was 2.7% and 5-year BCSM was 0.6%.
Among all patients with RS <18 (N = 379), of whom 7% had
adjuvant chemotherapy, 5-year distant recurrence was 1.2% for
those with micrometastases and 4.4% with 1N+. In a multivariable
analysis that included age, tumor size, tumor grade, nodal status,
and RS group, only tumor size (p = 0.02) and RS group (p = 0.003)
were significantly associated with distant recurrence risk.29
Together, the SEER and CHS registries represent the largest
record of outcomes of patients with HR+, HER2-negative, N+
breast cancer who were treated in routine practice based on RS
results. Although neither analysis used a randomized design, both
were national-level registries that did not exclude patients based
on age, sex, comorbidities, or socioeconomic status. The findings
of each registry consistently show that patients with RS <18 and N
+ breast cancer, particularly micrometastases and 1N+, treated
largely without adjuvant chemotherapy had favorable 5-year
outcomes. Although the 5-year outcomes of the SEER and CHS
registries, as well as the PlanB trial, are relatively short, the meta-
analysis
by
the
EBCTCG
has
shown
that
the
benefit
of
chemotherapy is seen within the first 5 years after treatment.
Importantly, outcomes at 5 years are maintained at 10-year follow-
up.7
DISCUSSION
Most clinical practice guidelines recommend that patients with HR
+, HER2-negative, N+ breast cancer be considered for adjuvant
chemotherapy, because positive nodal status is associated with
increased risk of recurrence compared with negative nodal status.
Theoretically, if the risk of metastatic recurrence is high enough,
very small relative benefits from chemotherapy could translate
into meaningful clinical benefits. Evidence suggests, however, that
not all patients with N+ breast cancer have poor prognosis nor do
all respond equally to chemotherapy. Thus, chemotherapy for all
would represent considerable overtreatment for some.
The 21-gene Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test is
clinically validated as a prognostic tool that also uniquely predicts
chemotherapy benefit in patients with node-negative or N+, HR+,
HER2-negative breast cancer.16–19,26,33 We have summarized here
the body of evidence supporting use of the 21-gene test in the HR
+, HER2-negative, N+ setting. RS results provide prognostic
insight that augments the information from clinico-pathologic
features, including extent of nodal involvement, and further refine
risk estimates of distant recurrence. Even in patients with HR+,
HER2-negative,
N+
breast
cancer,
who
as
a
cohort
were
considered at high risk of distant recurrence, the 21-gene test
further stratified risk of recurrence based on tumor biology. In
multivariable analyses that include clinico-pathologic features, the
RS result remained an independent, significant predictor of risk.23
Importantly, RS results are calculated based on patient’s tumor
biology, thereby sharpening risk estimation to the level of the
individual patient.

 The idea that prediction of treatment benefit can be inferred
from prognosis is flawed. A prognostic factor is one that is
associated with clinical outcomes, irrespective of treatment (i.e.,
either without treatment or with standard treatment).36 By
contrast, a predictive factor is one that is associated with clinical
outcomes in a treatment-dependent manner.36 A formal statistical
test for an interaction between a biomarker and treatment is
necessary to determine the predictive utility of that biomarker.34
RS results have allowed prediction of chemotherapy benefit in
individual patients. The SWOG S8814 analysis showed that
patients with RS <18 did not benefit from chemotherapy, in an
analysis that was prespecified and therefore designed to address
the question of chemotherapy benefit.18 Similarly, an NSABP B-20
analysis demonstrated that RS results can predict chemotherapy
benefit in patients with node-negative, ER+ breast cancer.19 As
such, the 21-gene test is the only genomic assay with level 1
evidence of chemotherapy benefit prediction in HR+, HER2-
negative breast cancer in both the N+ and node-negative
settings.18,19
An ongoing study, Treatment for Positive Node, Endocrine
Responsive Breast Cancer (RxPONDER; SWOG S1007),32,37 should
provide further insight into the RS cut-off at which a chemother-
apy benefit can be detected in patients with N+ breast cancer.
RxPONDER is a phase 3 study in which patients with 1–3N+ breast
cancer and RS ≤25 are randomized to hormonal therapy with or
without chemotherapy. The primary objective of the RxPONDER
study is to measure the interaction between the RS result (as a
continuous variable) and chemotherapy. Secondary objectives are
to measure time to events (distant recurrence, local/regional
recurrence, new invasive primary cancer, or death from any cause).
Results of the TAILORx study suggest little-to-no benefit of
adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with HR+, HER2-negative,
node-negative breast cancer and RS ≤25: excellent outcomes were
documented for those with RS <11 assigned to endocrine therapy
alone and comparable outcomes for those with RS 11–25
randomized to endocrine therapy ± chemotherapy.20,33 In an
exploratory analysis, however, some chemotherapy benefit was
shown in women ≤50 years with RS 16–25, with the greatest
impact on distant recurrence in those with RS 21–25. As a result,
RS 25 is now considered the key RS cut-off for node-negative
women >50 years and RS 15 for those ≤50 years.
Whether the same holds true in the HR+, HER2-negative, N+
setting remains to be seen. The RS test reveals underlying tumor
biology,
and
as
RS-defined
risk
increases,
the
degree
of
chemotherapy
benefit
also
increases.
Until
results
of
the
RxPONDER study report, the clinical validation studies—SWOG
S8814, transATAC, and the prospectively designed PlanB—are
supported by the real-world experience of the SEER and CHS
registries. Although neither registry was a randomized study, they
together showed that thousands of patients with micrometastatic
and 1–3N+ breast cancer and RS <18 treated largely or entirely
without
adjuvant
chemotherapy
had
remarkably
favorable
outcomes.
In conclusion, the evidence we have summarized is consistent
across retrospective-prospective, prospective, and registry studies
and shows that patients with N+ breast cancer and a low number
of positive nodes who received hormonal therapy but no adjuvant
chemotherapy have highly favorable outcomes if they also have
low RS results. The data are also consistent across geography, time
period of study enrollment, and routine clinical practice, suggest-
ing that the utility of the RS result and its association with
outcomes is independent of the treatment practices, time period,
or geographic location. This evidence suggests that patients with
limited nodal involvement (1–3N+) and low RS results should
discuss with their physicians the pros and cons of adjuvant
chemotherapy at the time their treatment plans are being
decided. Over the last decade or so, clinical guidelines groups
worldwide have recognized the value that tumor-specific genomic
data bring to treatment decision-making in node-negative early
breast cancer. With the steady accumulation of evidence, a role for
genomic assays in guidelines for all HR+, HER2-negative early
breast cancer, regardless of nodal status, should come into focus.
