ABSTRACT
Reactive immunization with a single-dose cholera vaccine that could
rapidly (within days) protect immunologically naive individuals during virgin soil epi-
demics, when cholera reaches immunologically naive populations that have not ex-
perienced cholera for decades, would facilitate cholera control. One dose of attenu-
ated Vibrio cholerae O1 classical Inaba vaccine CVD 103-HgR (Vaxchora) containing
�2 � 108 CFU induces vibriocidal antibody seroconversion (a correlate of protec-
tion) in �90% of U.S. adults. A previous CVD 103-HgR commercial formulation re-
quired �2 � 109 CFU to elicit high levels of seroconversion in populations in devel-
oping countries. We compared the vibriocidal responses of Malians (individuals 18 to
45 years old) randomized to ingest a single �2 � 108-CFU standard dose (n � 50)
or a �2 � 109-CFU high dose (n � 50) of PaxVax CVD 103-HgR with buffer or two
doses (n � 50) of Shanchol inactivated cholera vaccine (the immunologic compara-
tor). To maintain blinding, participants were dosed twice 2 weeks apart; CVD 103-
HgR recipients ingested placebo 2 weeks before or after ingesting vaccine. Serocon-
version (a �4-fold vibriocidal titer rise) between the baseline and 14 days after CVD
103-HgR ingestion and following the first and second doses of Shanchol were the
main outcomes measured. By day 14 postvaccination, the rates of seroconversion af-
ter ingestion of a single standard dose and a high dose of CVD 103-HgR were 71.7%
(33/46 participants) and 83.3% (40/48 participants), respectively. The rate of serocon-
version following the first dose of Shanchol, 56.0% (28/50 participants), was signifi-
cantly lower than that following the high dose of CVD 103-HgR (P � 0.003). The
vibriocidal geometric mean titer (GMT) of the high dose of CVD 103-HgR exceeded
the GMT of the standard dose at day 14 (214 versus 95, P � 0.045) and was �2-fold
higher than the GMT on day 7 and day 14 following the first Shanchol dose (P �
0.05). High-dose CVD 103-HgR is recommended for accelerated evaluation in devel-
oping countries to assess its efficacy and practicality in field situations. (This study

C
holera, a public health problem that persists among the least privileged popula-
tions of many developing countries and can rapidly dehydrate stricken individuals,
leading to hypovolemic shock and death without prompt rehydration, is particularly
devastating during virgin soil epidemics that reach immunologically naive populations,
as seen in Peru in 1991 and Haiti in 2010 (1, 2). In such epidemics, the case fatality rate
is often unacceptably high, as the familiarity with cholera and the infrastructure
required to treat cholera are typically lacking. Public health authorities have long
sought as an adjunct preventive tool a practical formulation of a single-dose cholera
vaccine that can rapidly (within days) protect highly susceptible populations harboring
no background immunity to Vibrio cholerae O1, to help control epidemic cholera and
diminish mortality (3). The oral cholera vaccine Shanchol, which contains a mix of
inactivated V. cholerae O1 and O139 strains and is administered as two doses 2 weeks
apart, is currently used to control seasonal epidemics of cholera in populations in some
developing countries where cholera is endemic.
CVD 103-HgR is a live attenuated Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, serotype Inaba,
classical biotype recombinant strain that harbors deletion of the A (ADP-ribosylating)
subunit of classical cholera toxin (CT) but expresses the immunogenic B (binding)
subunit, carries an Hg2� resistance marker gene inserted in hlyA (thereby inactivating
hemolysin A), and expresses the classical toxin-coregulated pilus colonization factor
(4–6). A single �2 � 108-CFU oral dose of CVD 103-HgR elicits �90% seroconversion
to serum vibriocidal antibody (7–9), a correlate of protection (9–14).
A CVD 103-HgR formulation containing �5 � 108 CFU was originally licensed and
commercialized as Orochol and Mutacol by the Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute (a
Berna product) for protection of travelers from industrialized countries (15), while an
�5 � 109-CFU formulation (Orochol E) was used in developing countries (3). The
1-log-higher dose level was needed to achieve adequate immunogenicity in individuals
residing in underprivileged conditions in developing countries (16–19). In 2009, PaxVax,
Inc., acquired licensure rights to CVD 103-HgR and is commercializing it as Vaxchora,
initially as a cholera vaccine for U.S. travelers (6, 9). A single dose of Vaxchora containing
�2 � 108 CFU manufactured from the PXVX0200 master cell bank of CVD 103-HgR is
highly immunogenic in stimulating serum vibriocidal antibody (a �90% seroconversion
rate) and has significantly protected U.S. volunteers against experimental challenge 10
days and 3 months after vaccination (9).
The demonstration in experimental challenge studies in U.S. volunteers that a single
�2 � 108-CFU dose of Vaxchora provides 91% efficacy against challenge at 10 days
after vaccination (9) and documentation by a World Health Organization (WHO) team
of the logistical practicality of single-dose use of the previous high-dose formulation of
the CVD 103-HgR vaccine (Orochol E) in reactive vaccination to control an explosive
cholera epidemic in Micronesia (3) elicited enthusiasm to evaluate a high-dose PaxVax
formulation of CVD 103-HgR as a potential future tool for reactive vaccination in
explosive virgin soil cholera epidemics in developing countries.
The current study was designed to assess preliminarily in a developing country
setting the clinical acceptability and immunogenicity of �2 � 109-CFU high-dose
versus �2 � 108-CFU standard-dose (identical to Vaxchora) PaxVax formulations of CVD
103-HgR and to compare these results with the immune responses following the first
and second doses of Shanchol vaccine, which served as an immunologic comparator to
give context to the serologic responses to CVD 103-HgR.
RESULTS
Participants. From 25 August 2014 to 16 September 2014, after informed consent
was obtained, 150 adult Malian volunteers were randomly allocated 1:1:1:1:2 to ingest
the �2 � 108-CFU standard dose of CVD 103-HgR followed 14 days later by ingestion

 of placebo (group A1, n � 25), placebo followed 14 days later by the �2 � 108-CFU
standard dose of CVD 103-HgR (group A2, n � 25), the �2 � 109-CFU high dose of CVD
103-HgR followed 14 days later by placebo (group B1, n � 25), placebo followed 14
days later by the �2 � 109-CFU high dose of CVD 103-HgR (group B2, n � 25), or two
doses of Shanchol 14 days apart (group C, n � 50) (Fig. 1).
Two participants, one each in groups A2 and B2, received placebo on day 0 but did
not complete the day 14 visit and did not receive vaccine; one was unavailable due to
travel, and the other was lost to follow-up. A third participant, who received �2 � 108
CFU of CVD 103-HgR on day 0, was subsequently diagnosed with tuberculosis and
excluded from receiving the second scheduled vaccination (placebo). All other study
participants received the vaccine (or placebo) to which they were assigned according
to the randomization list. There were slightly more females, and group mean ages were
23.9 to 25.0 years (Table 1).
Vaccine safety. Both CVD 103-HgR dose levels and Shanchol were well tolerated.
The only occurrence of diarrhea during the 7 days following ingestion of the study
product was in a placebo recipient. Solicited adverse reactions following a dose of CVD
103-HgR at either dose level or following placebo are shown in Table 2. There was no
dose-response effect.
There were 31 and 20 unsolicited adverse events reported by 19 standard-dose and
18 high-dose CVD 103-HgR recipients, respectively. All reactions were self-limited,
resolving within several days. There were no deaths, but two serious adverse events,
one for tuberculosis and one for acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, were reported,
and both were deemed to be not vaccine related.
Vaccine immunogenicity. (i) Direct analyses. Two participants, one each from
groups A and B, were excluded from the immunogenicity analyses because they
received no active vaccine. In addition, data for 3, 1, and 0 recipients of standard-dose
CVD 103-HgR, high-dose CVD 103-HgR, and Shanchol, respectively, were absent from
the calculation of day 14 seroconversion rates because of missing values. Seroconver-
sion was observed in 33 of 46 (71.7%) recipients of the standard dose versus 40 of 48
(83.3%) recipients of the high dose of CVD 103-HgR at 14 days after vaccination (P �
0.18) (Table 3) (absolute difference, 11.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], �5.2% to
28.3%). For comparison, the vibriocidal seroconversion rate 14 days after the first dose
of Shanchol was 56.0% (28 of 50 recipients; P � 0.003 versus high-dose CVD 103-HgR;
absolute difference, 27.3%; 95% CI, 9.3% to 43.8%). The seroconversion rate at 28 days
after a single high dose of CVD 103-HgR (89.4%) was not significantly different from
that at 28 days after initiation of the 2-dose Shanchol regimen (76.1%) (P � 0.090)
(Table 3). However, at 7 days after the first dose and after the second dose of Shanchol
(day 21), the vibriocidal antibody seroconversion rate was also significantly lower than
that at 7 and 21 days after the single high dose of CVD 103-HgR (P � 0.021 and P �
0.018, respectively) (Table 3).
There was virtually no difference in the baseline vibriocidal antibody geometric mean
titers (GMTs) for participants in the groups receiving the �2 � 108-CFU and �2 � 109-CFU
CVD 103-HgR dose levels, but the baseline vibriocidal GMTs in those groups were
significantly lower than the baseline vibriocidal GMT of the Shanchol group (Table 3).
In total, 27 of the 150 randomly allocated subjects had moderately elevated baseline
reciprocal titers, including 14 with a titer of 160, 9 with a titer of 320, 3 with a titer of
640, and 1 with a titer of 1,280. Fourteen of these 27 individuals were randomly
allocated to the Shanchol group, including 7 with a titer of 160, 4 with a titer of 320,
and 3 with a titer of 640. The group receiving the standard dose of CVD 103-HgR had
7 individuals with moderately elevated titers (including the subject with a titer of 1,280),
while the group receiving the high dose of CVD 103-HgR had 6 subjects with moder-
ately elevated titers.
The peak GMT in the recipients of the standard dose of CVD 103-HgR (GMT, 99; 95%
CI, 57 to 171) was observed 7 days after vaccination, while the GMT among the
recipients of the high dose of CVD 103-HgR (GMT, 214; 95% CI, 117 to 394) occurred on

 day 14 and was significantly higher than the GMT at day 14 in the standard-dose group
(P � 0.045). The Shanchol group manifested their peak GMT of 135 (95% CI, 81 to 226)
14 days after ingesting their second dose (28 days after the first dose); this GMT was
comparable to the GMT at day 28 for high-dose CVD 103-HgR (Table 3 and Fig. 2).

 Because the baseline GMTs of the CVD 103-HgR groups were unexpectedly lower
than the baseline GMT of the Shanchol group, despite the random allocation of the
participants to groups, a logistic regression analysis that adjusted for the baseline titer
was performed. In this analysis, the group receiving the single high dose of CVD
103-HgR still exhibited significantly higher rates of seroconversion by day 14 than the
Shanchol recipients 14 days after their first dose of vaccine. Linear regression on the
log-transformed vibriocidal titer by use of the log(baseline titer) as a covariate also gave
results similar to those obtained by comparison of the unadjusted GMTs. In linear
regression on the log(fold rise) with adjustment for log(baseline titer), the geometric
mean fold rise (GMFR) over the baseline for high-dose CVD 103-HgR remained higher
than the GMFR over the baseline for Shanchol, albeit not significantly (P � 0.11). A

Downloaded from 
 stratified (Mantel-Haenszel) analysis of seroconversion rates by day 14 in which each
observed value of the baseline titer (10, 20, etc.) defined a separate stratum also gave
results similar to those in Table 3; the rate of seroconversion for high-dose CVD
103-HgR was higher than that for Shanchol (odds ratio, 4.6; P � 0.005).
To perform a survival analysis of seroconversion rates for standard-dose versus
high-dose CVD 103-HgR, we compared the seroconversion rates for the entire period
through day 28 after vaccination for the primary comparison, standard-dose versus
high-dose CVD 103-HgR, using a log-rank test. Though there was a trend during the
entire 28-day period toward higher seroconversion rates in the recipients of high-dose
CVD 103-HgR, it was not statistically significant (P � 0.17).
(ii) Analysis with imputation for missing values. The results of the identical
analyses summarized in Table 3 but determined using statistical imputation to provide
values for the few missing data points (20) are shown in Table S1 in the supplemental
material. The results are almost identical to those in Table 3. Table S1 also shows the
results of analyses of the effect size comparing the three groups at each time point.
Vaccine shedding. The 1,483 stool specimens collected were analyzed for shedding
of vaccine organisms; none were positive.
DISCUSSION
Like other live oral bacterial vaccines, CVD 103-HgR exhibits lower immunogenicity
in developing country populations than industrialized country populations (16). To
overcome this, a 1-log-higher-CFU dose of the previous commercial formulation (Oro-
chol E) was utilized to achieve high rates of seroconversion with a single dose among
serosusceptible individuals of all ages (6, 16–19, 21–23). Expecting that this would also
be true with a high-dose PaxVax reformulation of CVD 103-HgR, we conducted a
double-blind study of two different CVD 103-HgR dose levels (�2 � 108 versus �2 �
109 CFU) in adults in Mali, West Africa, one of the world’
s least developed countries. We
used the two-dose regimen of Shanchol as an immunologic comparator and assessed
vibriocidal antibody titers 7 and 14 days after the first dose and after the second dose
of Shanchol.
Extensive evidence shows that the presence of serum vibriocidal antibodies follow-
ing receipt of a cholera vaccine or after wild-type infection is a correlate of protection
against cholera (10, 11, 13, 24). The targets of vibriocidal antibodies are epitopes
located on the O1 polysaccharide, which covers vibrios (6, 25). Almost all vibriocidal
antibodies can be absorbed with purified O1 polysaccharide, and the initial vibriocidal
antibody response resides in the IgM fraction of serum immunoglobulin, but some
long-lived IgG antibody also occurs. With repetitive exposure like that which occurs in
persons living in areas of endemicity, the proportion of IgG among the vibriocidal
antibodies increases. In areas of endemicity, a particular serum vibriocidal antibody titer

 at the time of presumed exposure correlates with protection (10, 11, 13). More recently,
in U.S. volunteers experimentally challenged with wild-type V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba
following receipt of Vaxchora or placebo, vibriocidal antibody seroconversion, in addi-
tion to the peak titer, was a strong correlate of protection (6, 9, 12). Importantly, a
precedent to use the noninferiority of vibriocidal antibody seroconversion as the basis
for both national regulatory licensure and WHO prequalification of a new inactivated
oral cholera vaccine, Euvichol (which has the same composition as Shanchol), has been
established (26).
Both dose levels of CVD 103-HgR were well tolerated, and the seroconversion rate
among high-dose recipients was higher at all time points postvaccination than among
standard-dose recipients, although the differences were not significant. However, the
GMT was significantly higher among high-dose CVD 103-HgR recipients than among
standard-dose recipients at 14, 21, and 28 days postvaccination. These results are
analogous to the findings of studies performed in Peru and Thailand, where the
strengths of the standard dose (Orochol) and high dose (Orochol E) of the previous CVD
103-HgR commercial formulations were compared (18, 19).
One limitation of our current study was an overestimation of the likely difference in
seroconversion rates between the two CVD 103-HgR dose levels. We had estimated a
29% difference at 14 days after vaccination, based on a Peruvian study of Orochol E
versus Orochol (18). Thus, the sample size in the current study was too small and the
study was underpowered to find the observed difference in the seroconversion rate
(14.4%) to be statistically significant.
Nonliving cholera vaccines, like Shanchol, that require a two-dose regimen have
proven effective in dampening seasonal increases in rates of disease in areas where
cholera is endemic and where known seasonality and high-risk foci allow targeting of
populations (27–29). However, the nonliving vaccines have not performed well when
administered as a single dose (27, 30), particularly in immunologically naive persons,
such as children �5 years of age in areas of endemicity (who suffer the highest
age-specific incidence of cholera). This recognized limitation is most relevant during
explosive virgin soil outbreaks, when cholera reaches immunologically naive popula-
tions that have not experienced cholera for decades (1, 2). In such instances, the
immunologic susceptibility of the population, the suboptimal treatment of cholera due
to inexperience, and a lack of infrastructure to transport cholera gravis patients rapidly
to treatment centers to receive intravenous and oral rehydration and antibiotics
conspire initially to cause unacceptably high case fatality rates and social disruption.
Such epidemics can be enormous, as occurred in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia in 1991
(1) and Haiti in 2010 (2). Other epidemics affecting Pacific Island states have generated
fewer cases but have stricken a notable portion of the entire population (3). A
single-dose vaccine that confers protection within 8 to 10 days after vaccination would
be logistically more practical for reactive mass vaccination to control explosive virgin
soil epidemics and diminish mortality than vaccines that require a two-dose regimen
with 2 weeks of spacing between doses. There is a similar need for a single-dose, rapidly
acting, effective vaccine when cholera reappears unexpectedly after years without
disease in a previously affected country, often striking different geographic regions.
Immunogenicity studies with Shanchol in populations in Kolkata, India, and Dhaka,
Bangladesh, where cholera is endemic, demonstrated moderate rates of seroconversion
7 to 14 days following the first dose of the two-dose Shanchol immunization regimen
(31, 32), generating interest to answer directly the question of whether significant
protection might be manifest after a single dose, at least among primed persons in
areas of endemicity. Accordingly, an enormous individual-randomized, placebo-
controlled trial among 204,700 poor urban residents of Dhaka, Bangladesh, assessed
the efficacy of a single dose of Shanchol in preventing cholera in residents of this
community, where cholera is hyperendemic. The overall efficacy was modest, 40% (95%
CI, 11% to 60%), but statistically significant (30). However, among children 1 to 4 years
of age, who are less immunologically primed than older subjects, vaccine efficacy was
only 16% (95% CI, �49% to 53%) (30). Similarly, a test-negative case-control study

 nested within a mass vaccination in Odisha, India, showed that single-dose Shanchol
had an effectiveness of 32.5% (95% CI, �318% to 89.5%) overall for individuals of all
ages (27).
Herein we report that the high-dose CVD 103-HgR live vaccine formulation gave
significantly higher rates of vibriocidal antibody seroconversion and higher GMTs at 7
and 14 days after a single dose than one dose of Shanchol. The significantly stronger
immunogenicity of the live vaccine is expected to be accompanied by an enhanced
capacity to protect subjects after a single oral dose in developing country settings, and
it is important for field studies to investigate this.
Two efficacy studies assessed the ability of Orochol E (109 CFU), the previous
commercial high-dose formulation of CVD 103-HgR, to prevent cholera in developing
country populations. First, a double-blind, individual-randomized, placebo-controlled
trial conducted in North Jakarta, Indonesia (33,696 vaccinees, 33,812 placebo recipi-
ents), where cholera is hyperendemic, failed to show significant protection over 4 years
of follow-up (33). However, following vaccination there was a precipitous fall in the
number of cholera cases in the population overall compared to that in the 4 years
before the trial, suggesting that powerful indirect protection diminished the overall risk
of cholera in controls as well as vaccinees. Second, during a cholera epidemic on
Pohnpei Island, Micronesia, WHO undertook a reactive mass immunization campaign
using single-dose Orochol E and calculated 79% vaccine effectiveness (95% CI, 72 to
85%) in preventing cholera under field conditions (3).
In the current study, no CVD 103-HgR vaccinees shed vaccine organisms in their
stool, but this was an expected result. From the regulatory authority perspective, an
attractive property of CVD 103-HgR identified early in its clinical development is that it
elicits high rates of seroconversion to vibriocidal antibody with high GMTs accompa-
nied by only modest excretion, even in North Americans (18 to 25% of subjects) (4, 7,
8). Among vaccinees in developing countries, excretion is minimal or absent, despite
ingestion of 1-log more organisms and strong immune responses (16–18, 21, 23, 34).
This is believed to be the consequence of the environmental enteropathy present in
most children and adults living in poverty in developing countries (16, 35). Indeed, in
Peru, where both standard-dose and high-dose CVD 103-HgR were compared, the
excretion of CVD 103-HgR was observed in a few percentage of high-socioeconomic-
level subjects who received the high dose, while no excretion was seen in low-
socioeconomic-level vaccinees who got the high dose (18). Lastly, in a previous trial in
Mali, even HIV-positive recipients of the high dose failed to show positive coprocul-
tures, while they exhibited good seroconversion rates (36). This phenomenon of
minimal or no shedding in developing country participants has also been described for
Peru-15, another single-dose live oral cholera vaccine (37).
Future studies will also include measurements of IgG B memory cells (38, 39) and
antitoxin antibodies. Based on the highly encouraging results obtained with high-dose
CVD 103-HgR, we will undertake additional clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa and other
less developed regions with a high-dose CVD 103-HgR formulation having nonstringent
cold chain requirements and a presentation suitable for practical administration to
young children. Evaluations of a single high dose of CVD 103-HgR will aim to gauge its
future suitability for use in reactive vaccination campaigns during explosive outbreaks
(particularly in cholera-naive populations) (2), for preemptive vaccination to diminish
the burden of seasonal endemic cholera, and for protection of high-risk populations in
which cholera epidemics have previously posed serious threats (e.g., refugee camps).

 Study design and participants. This single-site trial was conducted at l’
Unité Clinique of the Centre
pour le Développement des Vaccins, Mali (CVD-Mali), in Bamako, Mali, a country with one intermittent
focus of cholera (the Mopti Region). Bamako is free of endemic cholera. Over 3 years there were no
isolations of V. cholerae O1 among children �5 years of age with moderate to severe diarrhea in the
Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), whereas repetitive isolations were made from cases in three
South Asian sites and Mozambique (40). The trial was conducted from 25 August 2014 to 15 March 2015.
Interested persons presenting to the study site from 25 August 2014 to 16 September 2014 were
screened for eligibility. Eligible participants were healthy adults ages 18 to 45 years (inclusive) without
a notable medical history who could understand the study and provide informed consent. Women of
childbearing potential had negative urine pregnancy tests prevaccination and agreed to employ birth
control. Ineligible were persons in direct contact with immunodeficient patients; HIV-positive individuals;
persons with unstable medical conditions, a clinically relevant history of immunodeficiency, endocrine
disorder, cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, or gastrointestinal disease, neurologic illness, a
psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization, current drug or alcohol abuse, a history of abnormal stool
pattern or regular laxative use, previous cholera vaccination, cholera illness, or residence of �6 months
in the Mopti Region or travel there during a cholera outbreak; persons who received or planned to
receive another licensed vaccine from 14 days prior to the study vaccination until day 42; persons who
received or planned to receive antibiotics within 10 days prior to the study vaccination through to day
28; persons who received systemic chemotherapy within 5 years prior to the study; persons who received
or were to receive immunosuppressive therapy, radiation therapy, or high-dose inhaled steroids within
30 days prior to the study vaccination through to day 28; pregnant or breast-feeding women; persons
positive by a previous serologic test for hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus; and persons with other conditions
that investigators opined might affect participant safety or the ability to evaluate the study product.
Randomization and masking. An independent statistician produced a computer-generated list of
random allocations in blocks of alternating size of 6 or 12 participants. From 25 August to 16 September
2014, after providing stool and blood samples and in order of arrival into the vaccination room, eligible
volunteers were randomly allocated to receive one of three possible treatments: �2 � 108 CFU CVD
103-HgR (groups A1 and A2), �2 � 109 CFU CVD 103-HgR (groups B1 and B2), or Shanchol (group C).
Study products were prepared in a separate room by research pharmacy personnel not blind to the
treatment and then brought to the participant for administration. Participants in all three treatment
groups received two oral doses spaced 14 days apart. CVD 103-HgR was administered either at day 0
followed by placebo 14 days later (groups A1 and B1) or at day 14 following placebo at day 0 (groups
A2 and B2). Thus, there were 4 different randomized allocations of CVD 103-HgR when order was
considered; treatment allocations were in the ratio of 1:1:1:1:2. Persons allocated to Shanchol received
two oral doses in an open-label fashion. Study personnel who were not blind to the treatment and who
administered the study vaccines had no contact with the participants after vaccination and maintained
concealment of the product allocation from personnel blind to the product allocation.
Vaccine. Formulations of live attenuated vaccine were prepared from a PXVX0200 working cell bank
of CVD 103-HgR according to current good manufacturing practices by PaxVax, Inc., Redwood City, CA,
and packaged as a lyophilized powder within single-use sachets containing �2 � 108 CFU (identical to
Vaxchora) or �2 � 109 CFU of vaccine organisms and small amounts of stabilizer-filler. An accompanying
buffer powder sachet contained 2.5 g NaHCO3, 1.6 g ascorbic acid, and 0.2 g lactose. A vaccine dose was
prepared by suspending the contents of the vaccine and buffer sachets in a cup containing 100 ml of
bottled water. Placebo consisted of 100 ml of bicarbonate buffer. Shanchol, provided by Shantha
Biotechnics, a Sanofi Company, Hyderabad, India, was prepared per the instructions in the package
insert. After the vial was shaken, the vial contents (1.5 ml) were loaded into a needleless syringe and
deposited per os.
Procedures. Study participants were observed for 30 min after ingesting the study products. The
participants were visited at home on days 1, 2, 3, and 7 by clinical team members blind to the product
allocation to assess reactogenicity (diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, lethargy, anorexia) for
7 days following each vaccination. Diarrhea was defined as �4 loose stools in a 24-h period. Additional
clinic visits were completed on days 35 and 42, and a final visit was completed on day 180 (in the clinic
or via telephone). The occurrence of adverse events (AE) was recorded through 28 days postvaccination,
and information on serious adverse events (SAE) was collected through day 180. A safety monitoring
committee reviewed the safety data during the study.
Bacteriology. To detect excreted vaccine organisms, stool specimens were inoculated onto
thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar plates (Eiken, Tokyo, Japan) (41). Suspicious colonies were
confirmed to be Vibrio cholerae O1 Inaba (putatively the organism in the CVD 103-HgR vaccine) by
verifying that the subcultures were oxidase positive and agglutinated by anti-O1 and anti-Inaba antisera.
Immunology. Coded serum specimens were tested for Inaba vibriocidal antibody by technicians
blind to the product allocation using previously described methods with slight modifications (8, 42). V.
cholerae Inaba 89 was plated overnight at 37°
C on tryptic soy agar plates containing 5% sheep blood
(Becton, Dickinson [BD], NJ). Colonies were transferred to brain heart infusion (BHI; BD) plates and
incubated overnight at 37°
C. Single colonies were streaked onto duplicate BHI plates and incubated for
4 h at 37°
C, after which harvested bacteria were suspended in 0.85% saline to achieve �5 � 106 CFU/ml.
Serum samples (and controls) were serially diluted in 0.85% saline solution across 96-well plates,
whereupon 25 �l of a V. cholerae Inaba suspension containing 5 � 106 CFU/ml and 10% (vol/vol) guinea
pig complement was added, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°
C. BHI broth (0.15 ml) was added

 antibody titers of experimental samples were calculated on the basis of the OD620 values as the reciprocal of
the highest serum dilution that inhibited at least 75% of bacterial growth, determined through the viability
curve. Seroconversion was defined as a �4-fold rise in the postimmunization titer over the baseline titer.
Outcomes, statistical analyses, and sample size calculations. The study compared the rate of
seroconversion to serum Inaba vibriocidal antibody following ingestion of one of two different dose
levels of CVD 103-HgR with the rates of seroconversion elicited by one or two doses of Shanchol.
Seroconversion was defined as a �4-fold rise in titer by 14 days after the last dose (compared to that at
the baseline). Secondary aims were (i) to compare the mean fold rise in the serum Inaba vibriocidal
antibody titer (compared to the baseline titer) and the GMT by 14 days after vaccination with a single
�2 � 108-CFU standard dose or a �2 � 109-CFU high dose of CVD 103-HgR with those achieved with
Shanchol, (ii) to plot the kinetics of the serum Inaba vibriocidal antibody response achieved after ingestion of
a single oral dose of CVD 103-HgR containing �2 � 108 CFU or �2 � 109 CFU against those achieved after
ingestion of Shanchol, (iii) to assess the fecal shedding of CVD 103-HgR by vaccine recipients, and (iv) to
compare the rate of diarrhea (defined as �4 loose stools within 24 h) following administration of each vaccine
regimen with that following administration of placebo over 7 days of follow-up.
Immunogenicity analyses included all subjects contributing data for both vaccine and placebo
treatments. For calculation of the rate of seroconversion to vibriocidal antibody by 14 days after
ingestion of a dose of CVD 103-HgR or Shanchol, subjects with missing values at day 7 or 14 were not
included unless there was seroconversion based on the nonmissing values. Missing values were handled
similarly in the calculation of seroconversion rates at 21 and 28 days after vaccination. Vibriocidal
antibody responses were also summarized by GMT and GMFR, along with the corresponding two-sided
95% confidence intervals (CIs), from the baseline to day 14. Two-sided 95% CIs for differences between
seroconversion rates were calculated by a likelihood score method. CIs for ratios of GMTs and ratios of
GMFRs were calculated by exponentiating the confidence limits for differences between the means of
the log-transformed titers and the fold rises, based on t distributions. Seroconversion rates were
compared by chi-square tests, and GMTs and GMFRs were compared by two-sided t tests on log-
transformed titers.
Since some participants failed to appear for a follow-up visit, there were missing values because
some specimens had not been obtained. In addition to analyses of the data as collected, seroconversion
rates, GMTs, and GMFRs were estimated using multiple imputations of missing titer values. We did 100
imputations by fully conditional specification (20), which requires no specification of distributions, using
the PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE procedures in SAS (version 9.4) software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for
point estimates and effect sizes, two-sided 95% CIs, and pairwise comparisons. CIs on the imputed data
were based on t distributions, and comparisons were done using ti tests.
Adjustment for the baseline titer was made by logistic regression on seroconversion (yes/no) or linear
regression on the log-transformed titer or the log-transformed fold rise, with the baseline vibriocidal titer
or its logarithm being used as a covariate. In addition, pairwise comparisons of seroconversion rates by
day 14 were done in a stratified (Mantel-Haenszel) test in which each observed value of the baseline titer
(10, 20, etc.) was considered a separate stratum.
Safety results were summarized for the recipients of CVD 103-HgR, Shanchol, and placebo by the
percentage of study participants experiencing various reactions by day 7 after vaccination. Safety
endpoints were compared using a two-sided Fisher’
s exact test, with the P value being calculated by
doubling of the lower of the two one-sided P values, to account for unequal sample sizes. We combined
the placebo groups in order to maximize the power to find a statistically significant increase in a reaction
with any vaccine, ignoring any correlation induced by some participants contributing data for both
vaccine and placebo.
Comparisons of age and gender distributions among the groups were done by analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and the chi-square test, respectively. All comparisons were done according to original treat-
ment assignment. Statistical significance was indicated by a P value (two-sided, where appropriate) of
�0.05. P values were not adjusted for multiplicity.
The true underlying vibriocidal seroconversion rates were anticipated to be �72% after a �2 �
109-CFU dose and �43% after a �2 � 108-CFU dose, on the basis of results of a study of Orochol E versus
Orochol in Peruvians (18). For these estimated seroconversion rates, 46 subjects per group with analyzable
data would provide an �81% power to detect a significant difference (two-sided z test, alpha � 0.05). We
proposed enrolling 50 subjects per group to mitigate against the loss to follow-up of up to 4 subjects per
group. If data for all 50 subjects were available for analysis, we would have an �86% power to detect a
significant difference between groups.
The rate of diarrhea (4 or more watery stools in a 24-h period) in the placebo group was expected
to be �2%. The diarrhea rate in recipients of a �2 � 108-CFU dose or a �2 � 109-CFU dose of CVD
103-HgR was expected to be only slightly higher (�4%). Should the rate of diarrhea in a vaccine
group be unexpectedly high (�15%) and the rate in placebo recipients be 2%, with 100 postplacebo
follow-ups and 50 postvaccine follow-ups for each vaccine dose and vaccine group, we would have
an �86% power to detect a difference between vaccine and placebo (two-sided z test, alpha � 0.05).
