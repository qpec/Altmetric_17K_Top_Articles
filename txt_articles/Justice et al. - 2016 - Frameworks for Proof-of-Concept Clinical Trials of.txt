Abstract
Therapies targeted at fundamental processes of aging may hold great promise for enhancing the health of a wide population by delaying or 
preventing a range of age-related diseases and conditions—a concept dubbed the “geroscience hypothesis.” Early, proof-of-concept clinical 
trials will be a key step in the translation of therapies emerging from model organism and preclinical studies into clinical practice. This article 
summarizes the outcomes of an international meeting partly funded through the NIH R24 Geroscience Network, whose purpose was to 
generate concepts and frameworks for early, proof-of-concept clinical trials for therapeutic interventions that target fundamental processes of 
aging. The goals of proof-of-concept trials include generating preliminary signals of efficacy in an aging-related disease or outcome that will 
reduce the risk of conducting larger trials, contributing data and biological samples to support larger-scale research by strategic networks, and 
furthering a dialogue with regulatory agencies on appropriate registration indications. We describe three frameworks for proof-of-concept 
trials that target age-related chronic diseases, geriatric syndromes, or resilience to stressors. We propose strategic infrastructure and shared 
resources that could accelerate development of therapies that target fundamental aging processes.
Keywords: Aging—Geroscience Network—Clinical trials
In October 2015, global experts in the field of aging gathered at the 
“6th Annual Alliance for Healthy Aging Conference” in Newcastle, 
United Kingdom, which was followed by a retreat focused on how 
to conceptualize and facilitate early, proof-of-concept clinical trials 
that target fundamental aging mechanisms. The retreat was funded 
and organized through the National Institute on Aging (NIA) R24 
Geroscience Network, a consortium of 18 aging centers and aca-
demic groups across the United States (see Table 1), in partnership 
with separately supported centers in the European Union (EU). 
The experts present at the retreat included both basic scientists 
and clinicians with areas of expertise ranging from biogerontology, 
molecular biology, geriatrics, physiatry, oncology/stem cell transplan-
tation, and epidemiology as well as members of US and EU research 
funding and drug regulatory agencies. This article summarizes the 
outcomes of this retreat, including outlining the goals of proof-of-
concept clinical trials involving fundamental biological processes 
that contribute to aging, developing three consensus frameworks 
(targeting age-related chronic diseases, geriatric syndromes, and 
impaired resilience) for such trials, and proposing opportunities for 
accelerating progress toward translational therapies.

 Approach
Clinical 
Trials of Interventions 
That 
Target 
Fundamental Aging Processes: Proof-of-Concept
The “geroscience hypothesis” is that targeting fundamental aging 
processes might delay, prevent, alleviate, or reverse a wide range of 
diseases and conditions for which age is the primary non-modifiable 
risk factor. In recent years, preclinical studies targeting fundamen-
tal aging processes have shown promising results in delaying aging-
related biological parameters, as well as in demonstrating beneficial 
effects on measures related to frailty, age-related chronic disease, 
and overall health (1–7). Some of these approaches involve cellular 
and molecular mechanisms that may be readily testable in humans 
through drug repurposing. Examples of this include reducing the 
burden of senescent cells in human tissues using senolytic drugs (anti-
cancer drugs, high-dose flavonoids, or Bcl-2 family member inhibi-
tors) (5,8,9), inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
signaling with rapamycin (10), or enhancing AMP-activated pro-
tein kinase activity and inhibiting mTOR with 17α-estradiol (11). 
Advancing these studies “beyond the bench” and into proof-of-con-
cept clinical trials is a key step in the translational continuum to take 
these interventions toward clinical practice (Figure 1). 
For the purposes of this meeting and paper, proof-of-concept tri-
als are envisioned as small, short, relatively inexpensive studies that 
provide initial evaluation of safety and dosing, test efficacy toward 
biological outcomes, and provide supportive data on clinical out-
comes to help design and justify larger clinical trials (Figure 2). One 
goal of a proof-of-concept trial is to “de-risk” an intervention by 
providing a signal of efficacy in an outcome that is relevant to the 
ultimate clinical indication as well as data on intervention safety in 
the target population (12). The key difference between most tra-
ditional disease-targeting Phase 2 studies (which target pathways 
typically identified within the affected tissue) and proof-of-concept 
studies testing the geroscience hypothesis is that the molecular target 
in geroscience-oriented studies should be identified from the field 
of aging, and should not directly act on risk factors specific to a 
disease process of interest (eg, cholesterol in atherosclerosis studies) 
(13–15). In order to help test the geroscience hypothesis, some tri-
als might explicitly target a non-traditional primary outcome that 
is broadly representative of aging, such as a geriatric syndrome (eg, 
sarcopenia or mild confusion). Other studies with a more traditional 
primary outcome involving a specific disease might instead incor-
porate secondary outcomes that help determine if the intervention 
has broader effects on aging phenotypes. Successive trials would 
iteratively refine the most effective interventions, doses, timing of 
interventions, and populations to target in subsequent larger studies.
Proof-of-concept trials will also help to refine a framework for 
translational research and advance dialogue with regulatory agencies 
(16). Standardization of approaches across multiple studies and col-
lection of an array of aging-related molecular and physiological meas-
ures would streamline efforts to initiate clinical trials, lend insights 
into the role of fundamental aging processes across a broad range of 
diseases, and inspire new basic research directions. Some of the out-
comes most representative of the effects of aging on the health of indi-
viduals and populations, such as geriatric syndromes, multimorbidity, 
or dependence in activities of daily living, are not currently recognized 
as end points for registration by regulatory agencies. Completion of a 
critical mass of trials testing geroscience-derived compounds will cru-
cially advance discussions with regulatory agencies to expand the defi-
nitions of registration end points for therapies that may have broad 
effects not limited to a single disease process.
Below, we present three related conceptual frameworks for proof-
of-concept studies of interventions that target fundamental aging 
mechanisms, guided by the ultimate goals of reducing disease burden, 
reducing morbidity/disability, and maintaining or improving daily 
function and independence in aging populations. The three frame-
works involve targeting age-related diseases, geriatric syndromes, and 
resilience to stressors. Following detailed descriptions of these three 
frameworks, we present elements common to each, as well as a table 
highlighting commonalities, differences, strengths, and weaknesses 
related to each framework (Tables 2 and Supplementary Table S1).
Frameworks for Proof-of-Concept 
Trials 
Targeting 
Fundamental Aging Processes
Trials Targeting Age-Related Diseases
Age-related diseases are defined as conditions in which age is leading 
risk factor and the dysfunction of an organ system occurs in the absence 
of a single inciting event. For example, arteriosclerotic vascular disease, 
osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, type II diabetes mellitus, most cancers, and 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias could all be considered to be 
“age-related” diseases (17). Proof-of-concept trials would evaluate 
interventions that affect these diseases ultimately through effects on

Figure 1. Pipeline of drug development for interventions that target 
fundamental aging processes. As in other fields, numerous potential 
interventions will be winnowed in the preclinical phase, with those showing 
the most promise for targeting the biology of aging progressing to initial 
safety studies in humans. Small proof-of-concept clinical trials might then 
“de-risk” these candidate interventions by providing signals of efficacy and 
further safety data to better predict success in large clinical trials designed to 
support Food and Drug Administration approval.

 fundamental aging processes, rather than proximately through a single 
disease-specific pathophysiology. The geroscience hypothesis predicts 
that interventions targeting basic aging mechanisms would show effi-
cacy in multiple disease states whose proximate pathophysiology is not 
directly related. For example, a series of proof-of-concept trials might 
test if an intervention demonstrates a beneficial molecular effect in sep-
arate cohorts of subjects with arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and non-
vascular dementia. Demonstrating such pleiotropic effects is important 
to show that geroscience-related interventions targeting fundamental 
aging processes might be a viable approach to manage or prevent an 
array of age-related conditions, rather than a single disease.
Population
Age-related diseases are often slowly progressive over years, yet choos-
ing the optimal time to intervene is critical both for the success of proof-
of-concept trials and for identification of treatment windows that will 
provide maximum health benefit to patients. Collaborations between 
clinicians and researchers are essential to predict key time points for 
intervention, as the “sweet spot” for maximizing molecular and clinical 
evidence of benefit is likely to be different for different diseases.
Outcomes
Measurements that provide an index of interactions between a drug 
and the relevant pathophysiological processes are the ultimate driver 
of go/no-go decisions when advancing to larger clinical trials. The 
short duration of proof-of-concept trials suggests that molecular out-
comes may provide a stronger signal than more heterogeneous clini-
cal outcomes. When possible, these outcomes should provide evidence 
that a drug intervention attenuates deleterious molecular changes in 
the tissue of interest (eg, insulin sensitivity in muscle biopsies from 
subjects with diabetes). When tissue is not available, biomarkers 
specifically related to a disease process can be used (eg, circulating 
markers of bone turnover specific to osteoporosis), and evaluation 
of phenotypic changes with disease progression can be examined (eg, 
progression of valve calcification in subjects with aortic valve stenosis 
using computerized tomography scanning). Finally, outcomes more 
generally related to aging could be incorporated as practical, using 
standardized toolkits that can be shared across trials. These aging out-
comes ought not to detract from the primary disease-specific proof-
of-concept outcome, but would be “value-multipliers” that would 
provide additional data to help discern between “responders” and 
“nonresponders” and how geroscience-derived interventions affect 
fundamental aging mechanisms in different patient populations.
Many of these trials may be designed with the strategy of con-
ducting a short-term trial (eg, weeks to a month) with a prospective 
plan for longer-term follow-up (eg, months to a year). One year is 
long for an initial proof-of-concept study, but significant outcomes 
might become evident within one or a few months. If so, it would be

Figure 2. Frameworks and goals for proof-of-concept clinical trials of interventions that target fundamental aging processes. 
These interventions are hypothesized 
to affect multiple age-related diseases and conditions: the “geroscience hypothesis.” Three frameworks are presented for the design of clinical trials to test 
these interventions for effects on outcomes related to age-related diseases, geriatric syndromes, and resiliency. Proof-of-concept clinical trials would test the 
geroscience hypothesis, but also provide evidence of efficacy in the outcome being targeted, as well as data and samples for further research. Ultimately, proof-
of-concept trials will help justify and in the design of larger clinical trials and support new regulatory indications for interventions that target fundamental aging 
processes.

 feasible to publish effects detected at early time-points, but also wise 
to plan for longer-term follow-up in order to (1) increase likelihood 
of definitively testing the impact of the intervention, rather than con-
cluding the trial at an early point but with an indeterminate out-
come, (b) ascertain the durability of any beneficial effects detected 
soon after the intervention, (c) detect late-appearing side effects, and 
(d) test if the intervention can be administered over a short time, 
but have a long-term impact. The latter point would be particularly 
relevant in the case of interventions that alter tissue composition, 
such as senolytics, which may prove effective if used intermittently.
Example
Rapamycin for osteoporosis. The geroscience-derived hypothesis 
is that rapamycin will protect against age-associated bone loss via 
activation of autophagy (18) in osteocytes (19). In this example, 
a concept trial would focus on improvement in plasma markers 
of bone turnover. A reasonable proof-of-concept trial size could 
be enrollment of 100 patients or less who are 65 years and older 
with a new diagnosis of age-related osteoporosis and femoral neck 
T-score ≤2.5 who are also independent in activities of daily living 
and instrumental activities of daily living. Patients would continue 
to receive current standard of care treatments for osteoporosis and 
would be randomized to rapamycin or placebo. The primary out-
come measure would be changes in urinary and plasma biomarkers 
of bone turnover/osteocyte function/osteoclast function at 1, 6, and 
12 months of treatment (compared to baseline) and could include 
alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, collagen type 1 cross-linked 
N-telopeptide, or Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23). A second-
ary outcome could be the change in femoral neck T-score at 1 year 
compared to enrollment baseline. Clinical outcomes related to oste-
oporosis (eg, new fractures, falls) within the 12-month treatment 
period could be tertiary outcomes, although the study would not 
be powered for these. Importantly, investigators could also obtain 
a number of standardized measures of physiological aging (eg, grip 
strength and gait speed) and additional blood samples for future 
molecular studies.
Trials Targeting Geriatric Syndromes
“Geriatric syndromes” are common conditions in the elderly that 
have multifactorial causes, usually including several diseases as 
well as other age-related physiological changes. Examples include 
frailty, falls, cognitive decline, major mobility disability, delirium, 
pressure ulcers, and incontinence (20). They can be debilitat-
ing, with a major impact on quality of life, independence, and 
longevity. Geriatric syndromes do not have a single underlying 
pathophysiology but represent the integration of dysfunction in 
multiple organ systems. Due to these multifactorial causes, the 
best evidence-based treatments are multicomponent interventions 
(21). Critically, this characteristic may make them particularly 
responsive to interventions that target fundamental processes 
of aging, which have pleiotropic effects on multiple organ sys-
tems. Preclinical studies suggest this may indeed be feasible (22). 
Senolytic agents delay multiple frailty-associated phenotypes in 
progeroid mice (8) and Janus kinase (JAK1/2) inhibitors, which 
attenuate the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, alleviate 
frailty in older mice (6).
Population
For prevention studies, investigators could select for higher-risk 
group by enrolling individuals who already meet some clinical 
criteria for a syndrome (eg, “prefrail”), have elevated biomarker 
risk profiles, or have multiple chronic diseases that increase risk 
for developing geriatric syndromes. Alternatively, certain younger 
populations exhibit accelerated aging and early onset of geriat-
ric syndromes: cancer survivors who underwent chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy, or individuals with HIV (23–26). For studies aiming 
to slow progression or reverse geriatric syndromes, individuals with 
mild to moderate symptoms would provide a robust signal-to-noise 
ratio for clinical outcomes while not presenting the challenging task 
of needing to alleviate advanced or severe disease. As with other out-
comes related to aging, a goal of initial small trials may be to char-
acterize optimal windows for intervention.
Outcomes
Known molecular pathways contributing to certain syndromes can 
be used to design intermediate biological and physiological out-
comes. For example, frailty and immobility are often closely related 
to sarcopenia, which has well-characterized physiological mark-
ers (eg, grip strength (27)) and emerging molecular markers (eg, 
senescent cell density or mTOR activity in skeletal muscle (28)). 
Cognitive tests such as processing speed or executive functioning 
might be an early physiological marker for cognitive decline (29). 
Some geriatric syndromes, such as pressure ulcers or incontinence, 
may not have intermediate outcomes identified so far that are as 
tractable.
Example
Dasatinib plus quercetin for frailty. The geroscience-derived 
hypothesis is that reducing senescent cell burden would improve 
markers of patient frailty. In this example, a concept trial would 
focus on confirming efficacy of the drug in clearing senescent cells. 
The study would enroll 10–20 adults 60–80 years old who undergo 
skin biopsies before and after a single course of dasatinib plus 
quercetin. The primary outcome would be the degree of senescent 
cell clearance, measured by senescent markers in biopsy tissue (eg, 
p16, p21, senescence associated β-galactosidase, telomere associ-
ated foci, etc.). A secondary outcome could be evaluation of blood 
samples for changes in circulating markers of inflammation and 
cellular senescence following treatment with dasatinib and querce-
tin. The inclusion of a frailty assessment at enrollment (including 
standardized tests of grip strength and gait speed) would permit 
correlations between frailty measures and senescent cell burden, 
with an optional extension to examine change in frailty measures 
at 3 months.
Trials targeting resilience
A key aspect of aging is a loss of resilience or a decrease in the 
capacity to maintain homeostasis and return to baseline function 
following exposure to stressors, because of decreased physiologic 
reserve (30). Such stressors can include elective or nonelective 
surgery, chemotherapy, periods of immobility, and numerous age-
associated acute pathophysiologic events (ischemic cardiovascular 
events, fall-related fractures, infections, etc.). In older adults, 50%–
80% of all new disability (defined as new inability to perform 
activities of daily living) begins suddenly after a hospitalization for 
injury or illness (31). Preventing even some of this disability could 
save tens of billions of dollars in medical and long-term care costs 
every year (32). Aside from the human and financial imperatives, 
targeting resilience could aid in testing the geroscience hypoth-
esis by providing a more sensitive and specific assay for testing

 therapeutic interventions compared to measurement of general 
health under static conditions.
If the stressors can be planned in advance, the investigational 
agent can be provided beforehand (ie, prehabilitation). Trials of ger-
oscience-derived interventions might be modeled on trials of lifestyle 
prehabilitation interventions that have proven effective at improv-
ing molecular markers and clinical outcomes following surgery (33) 
or antineoplastic therapies (34,35). Unlike a prehabilitation study 
design, treatment administration at or immediately following an 
unplanned event such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or fracture 
(ie, “opportunistic” patient recruitment) depends on incidence of the 
unplanned events. Furthermore, time elapsed between the unplanned 
event and initiation of treatment may be critical. These points make 
study design and data interpretation challenging—although ulti-
mately the goal must be to apply these interventions to the unplanned 
stressors that cause most disability in older adults (31).
Population
The population of older adults undergoing significant medical stress-
ors is both readily available for study and unusually amenable to 
improvements in short-term clinically significant outcomes. Age is 
an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes from interventions 
such as cardiac surgical procedures (36), which are commonly pur-
sued in older adults (37). However, this population is confounded by 
the necessary presence of the disease being treated, and often other 
comorbid health problems that could act as confounding variables. 
Thus, an alternative approach for proof-of-concept studies might be 
to test “artificial” stressors in healthier middle-aged or older adults, 
such as a skin biopsy to assess wound healing or vaccination to test 
immune responses. This strategy also provides the advantage of 
greater scientific control, from study population and initial condi-
tions to selected intervention and outcomes.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes would be specific to the subject population 
and stressor, and focused on restoration of baseline function follow-
ing the applied challenge or stressor. Depending on the study design, 
this could mean, for example, time to healing from a skin biopsy, 
or proportion of subjects discharged home versus to skilled nursing 
facilities after surgery. Outcomes could also include more general 
outcomes, such as grip strength, gait speed, or levels of circulat-
ing inflammatory mediators, as well as subjective measures such as 
patient-reported pain and perceived disability.
Example
Cardiac surgery “prehabilitation” with myostatin inhibitor. The ger-
oscience-derived hypothesis would be that myostatin inhibition begun 
prior to elective coronary artery bypass surgery will reduce postsurgical 
muscle atrophy via enhanced satellite cell activation (38). A blocked-
randomized design could be employed at a hospital with high surgical 
volume to enroll ~40 adults aged 70–80 years over several months. 
Along with usual preoperative care, patients would be randomized to 
2 weeks of myostatin inhibitor treatment immediately preoperatively. 
The primary outcome could be change in quadriceps muscle power 
and stair-climbing power at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively (39). 
Secondary outcomes could include biological markers of myostatin 
activation in skeletal muscle biopsies obtained pre- and postoperatively 
(eg, Pax7 and MyoD protein levels), as well as clinical measures, such 
as time to discharge and gait speed at discharge. Tertiary outcomes, 
which the study would not be powered for, could include proportion 
discharged home versus to skilled nursing facilities, time to return 
home, and new disability in activities of daily living at 1 month.
Common Elements of Proof-of-Concept 
Trials 
Targeting Fundamental Aging Processes
There are themes that cut across proof-of-concept clinical trials 
under any of the three frameworks: age-related diseases, geriatric 
syndromes, and resilience to stressors.
Populations
As noted above, many trials of interventions that target fundamental 
aging processes would include older subjects, who would make up 
by far the largest group in which such interventions will ultimately 
be used. The rationale for selecting specific study populations var-
ies among the frameworks, but a common theme is to balance the 
risk of expected outcomes against magnitude of expected benefits in 
order to find an adequate signal-to-noise ratio. In general, subjects 
who are older or more frail are at higher risk for poor outcomes from 
usual care—such as new disability and loss of independence after a 
hospitalization. Enrolling older or frailer subjects could therefore 
provide higher power to detect improved outcomes in a small trial, 
and any improvement in outcomes is likely to be highly meaningful 
to the health of the subjects. However, older and more frail subjects 
are also more susceptible to clinically significant adverse effects from 
most treatments, and there may be a point of diminishing benefits 
from interventions targeting aging. In certain circumstances, there 
may be a benefit to pursuing proof-of-concept studies in popula-
tions with accelerated aging-like states, as described above. Genetic 
progeroid syndromes are a special group that might be considered, 
but the established research infrastructure and relative ease of regu-
latory approval would need to be balanced against the limitations of 
a small population size and restricted generalizability.
Outcomes
Although all trials include efficacy and safety outcomes that are spe-
cific to the particular intervention or indication (disease, syndrome, or 
stress) under study, it would also be important to study biomarkers 
that broadly reflect fundamental aging processes. Along a spectrum 
from more basic to more clinical, such biomarkers might include those 
of phenomena associated with aging (eg, telomere length, mTOR activ-
ity, or senescent cell abundance), physiological measures that are gener-
ally impaired in many older people (eg, grip strength or gait speed), and 
incident diagnosis of a new age-related disease or syndrome during the 
defined treatment/follow-up period (eg, dementia or metabolic disease). 
Furthermore, biomarkers that provide an index of drug activity/target 
activation would be of great utility in early proof-of-concept clinical 
studies (such as S6 kinase activity in trials of mTOR modulators or 
senescent cell burden following senolytic treatment), particularly when 
combined with biomarkers and/or outcomes that provide an index of 
off-target or unwanted effects of the drug (eg, reductions in muscle 
protein synthesis with mTOR inhibition). If such efforts were coalesced 
in the form of a Geroscience Network, this would also allow multiple 
research groups to evaluate pleiotropic effects of various interventions 
(eg, possible reductions in senescent cell burden with mTOR inhibition, 
etc.) across studies in a broad variety of populations.
Interventions
These frameworks can apply broadly to behavioral, dietary, nutra-
ceutical, or pharmacological interventions (40,41). However, the

 present discussion applies most specifically to either repurposing of 
existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to 
new indications related to aging, or to new drugs on the pathway to 
an initial indication. Approved drugs with strong evidence as thera-
pies that target fundamental processes of aging from human and ani-
mal studies are reviewed in Newman and colleagues (42) in this issue 
and include metformin, rapamycin, acarbose, and 17α-estradiol. 
Other promising compounds with varying degrees of evidence 
include the senolytic drugs (dasatinib and quercetin in isolation or in 
combination, navitoclax (9)), mitochondrial-targeted peptides, novel 
analogues of rapamycin, NAD therapies (nicotinamide riboside 
and nicotinamide mononucleoside), myostatin, and sirtuin activa-
tors. Demonstration of efficacy in preclinical models that accurately 
recapture clinical scenarios can be challenging, but are essential to 
increasing the probability of success in proof-of-concept trials [see 
Huffman and colleagues (43) in this issue].
Pairing an intervention with a study outcome should be informed 
whenever possible by hypotheses developed from preclinical, trans-
lational, or epidemiological data, because targeting a single path-
way is not likely to be beneficial in all circumstances. For example, 
senescent fibroblasts and endothelial cells are essential in the early 
response to cutaneous insult and subsequent wound healing (44), 
making perioperative senolytic treatment unadvisable. Similarly, 
mTOR inhibition suppresses skeletal muscle hypertrophy (45), and 
so might exacerbate muscle atrophy from immobilization, such as 
following major surgery.
Interventions will often be tested against standard-of-care, which 
in many cases will include some form of non-pharmacological (often 
intensive) intervention, such as cardiac rehabilitation following car-
diac surgery. Exercise may be a common comparator and is some-
thing of a special case, having evidence of benefit in many diseases 
and geriatric syndromes but with large variability in subject response 
(46–49). Along with being compared to the effect of exercise, drug 
interventions might be evaluated for adding to its effect or providing 
a greater uniformity of response.
Size, length, and cost
Proof-of-concept studies should be lean and focused and be powered 
to detect a signal in the primary outcome that would justify further 
study. Ideally, they might be funded by NIH R01 grants or other 
relatively small funding mechanisms, and initiated at a single site 
leveraging shared resources as below and an existing clinical care 
infrastructure (eg, prehabilitation clinic). They would usually enroll 
10 to less than 100 people and run from a month to a year. Multiple, 
coordinated, smaller studies have a variety of advantages over fewer, 
larger, monolithic studies for proof-of-concept. Many smaller trials 
can explore a wider range of concepts, timing of interventions, char-
acteristics of participants most likely to respond, doses, and drug-
condition pairs. As early trials suggest areas of focus, conducting 
multiple, small follow-on trials in parallel will speed iterative refine-
ments. Proof-of-concept can spiral from brief, low-cost trials focus-
ing on biomarker outcomes to larger, longer trials with outcomes 
ever-further on the clinical spectrum, with each phase providing jus-
tification and design information for the next.
Safety
Some proposed interventions are FDA-approved with extensive 
clinical experience regarding safety and adverse effects (eg, met-
formin), whereas others will be new chemical entities. The latter 
will require Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic studies, preferably 
in a population relevant to aging trials, before proceeding to the 
proof-of-concept trials described here. FDA-approved compounds 
may also require additional studies to confirm tolerability and phar-
macokinetics in the populations targeted by studies testing inter-
ventions that target fundamental aging mechanisms, especially if 
prior data in older people are limited. As with efficacy outcomes, 
safety outcomes should be designed to capture expected side effects 
of the specific intervention (eg, nausea for metformin, oral ulcers 
for rapamycin) as well as nonspecific symptoms and global adverse 
outcomes, both self-reported and objective where appropriate. 
Elderly subjects are more susceptible to side effects that would be 
minor in younger individuals, with serious health problems ensuing 
as the side effect interacts with underlying organ dysfunction and 
age-related changes. Study design should therefore pay particular 
attention to significant secondary adverse outcomes that could be 
related to more minor side effects, such as weight loss associated 
with nausea or oral ulcers, falls associated with dizziness, or delir-
ium associated with sedation. Standardization of safety outcomes 
can help increase the power of multiple closely related proof-of-
concept studies of an intervention to detect important safety issues 
before a decision is made to proceed to larger studies. Ultimately, 
the decision as to whether any safety risks or adverse effects are tol-
erable must be made in the context of the risks of the usual course 
of events and the expected benefit of an intervention, and with input 
from regulatory bodies and the broader community. For some inter-
ventions and trial designs, this decision might be conceptually simi-
lar to that for chemotherapy of advanced cancers; for others, more 
as for primary prevention interventions.
Regulatory issues
Demonstrating safety is a necessary prerequisite to proof-of-con-
cept trials. Institutional Review Board and FDA applications can 
cross-reference the investigational new drug approval for existing 
compounds, although safety may need to be separately confirmed 
in frail, multimorbid, or elderly populations. Proof-of-concept tri-
als will usually not be powered to support registration, or thorough 
analysis of safety and adverse events. However, they should still be

infrastructure to accelerate progress through early clinical trials of 
interventions targeting fundamental aging processes. Many of these shared 
resources might be coordinated by new Geroscience Translational Network 
Centers, which would specialize in particular aspects of preclinical basic 
research, clinical trial support, and training.

 designed with the goal of justifying larger trials targeting an existing 
registration end point, or supporting the creation of new registration 
end points that reflect the targeting of fundamental aging processes. 
The three frameworks might form the foundations of such new end 
points: composite end points of multiple age-related diseases (mul-
timorbidity), geriatric syndromes with clear clinical definitions, or 
as adjuvant or preventative therapies for other medical treatments 
(resilience).
Accelerating Progress 
The workshop developed a number of concepts that could help 
accelerate and sustain progress in translating interventions into 
and through clinical trials (Figure 3). These suggestions for com-
mon resources or strategic infrastructure span the full breadth 
of the translational pipeline, and are in some cases inspired by 
similar efforts in fields such as oncology, whereas others leverage 
existing common infrastructure to assist translational geroscience 
(14,50,51).
Many of the most promising drugs in the geroscience pipeline 
are in fact repurposed FDA-approved drugs that have been found 
to regulate fundamental processes related to aging (eg, metformin, 
rapamycin, and others). Many other promising drugs may exist, 
with unrecognized potential. An expert panel might review all 
FDA-approved drugs for their potential in targeting fundamental 
processes of aging. Candidate drugs could be rapidly screened in pre-
clinical studies and would be likely to proceed more rapidly to early 
clinical trials than novel compounds, and the geroscience community 
could engage existing resources for identifying new indications for 
repurposed drugs (eg, National Center for Advancing Translational 
Sciences Drug Repurposing Program).
Beyond “lead compound” identification, however, there are 
steps that can be taken to accelerate progress in testing gerosci-
ence-derived interventions. First, common templates can be devel-
oped for clinical trial designs utilizing the frameworks described 
here, for investigational new drug applications to the FDA, for 
establishment of data safety monitoring boards, and for applica-
tions to Institutional Review Boards. These templates could be 
developed by trialists within a Geroscience Network, updated 
regularly to reflect new data and experience gained through early 
trials, and shared freely with participating investigators and insti-
tutions. The NIA’s Clinical Research Study Investigator’s Toolbox 
(52) might provide a starting point that can be adapted for gero-
science trials.
Second, a national network could develop a standardized 
“toolkit” of aging-related outcomes that can be modularly incorpo-
rated into a variety of study designs, as has been developed in other 
fields (53). The toolkit might include a set of specified biochemical 
markers with detailed protocols for collection and measurement, 
and sets of physiological measures or functional outcomes, all of 
which would be directly comparable across many trials. The toolkit 
would provide a common data set for assessing how any interven-
tion affects fundamental aging processes, as well as building a data-
base to guide the mechanistic pairing of interventions with different 
outcomes. A similar standardized toolkit of safety outcomes and 
adverse events could help ensure that safety concerns are identified 
early. Network centers could serve as core facilities for efficiently 
running assays from submitted biological specimens.
Third, biological specimens generated in these trials can 
be collected into a new national geroscience biobank. Such a 
biobank could facilitate wide access for the entire scientific 
community to the diversity of biological specimens that will be 
generated (54), uniquely enriched in samples from multimorbid, 
frail, and older individuals. Distribution would be mediated by a 
scientific review process for vetting and prioritizing their use. The 
biobank would be a resource invaluable not only for the gerosci-
ence community but also for all biomedical researchers studying 
a disease process that is related to aging. Critically, the value of 
such a resource would not depend on the success of any or all of 
the morbidity-specific trials described herein, but instead would 
allow investigators in multiple fields to understand the interplay 
between mechanisms thought to contribute to the complex con-
text of organismal aging.
Fourth, the institutions in a Geroscience Network could develop 
as centers specializing in specific types of clinical trials, facilitat-
ing the high-throughput performance of trials that test different 
interventions, target populations, timing, etc. in a common clinical 
trial framework, maintaining shared templates for a trial frame-
work, and training investigators from other sites. One center might 
develop expert basic science and clinical personnel, and physical 
infrastructure, dedicated to trials targeting frailty, for example, 
whereas another center might develop equivalent infrastructure 
for trials involving prehabilitation prior to elective cardiac surgery. 
Outside investigators would find an open pathway to test their 
new interventions at centers, and launching trials at noncenter 
sites would be aided by the standardization and shared resources 
promoted by centers. Centers would facilitate the rapid and repro-
ducible completion of the iterative trials necessary to bring inter-
ventions into effective clinical practice as quickly as possible.
These four concepts are inspired by the remarkable success of 
cooperative research networks in other biomedical fields, such as the 
Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology and ECOG-ACRIN Cancer 
Research Group. A further developed Geroscience Translational 
Network would not duplicate the efforts of such disease-specific 
cooperatives, but would seek collaborations with them. Existing 
research infrastructure at Geroscience Network institutions, such as 
the Clinical and Translational Science Award programs, could be lev-
eraged to reduce startup costs and provide additional shared efficien-
cies. Importantly, individual investigators outside the Geroscience 
Network could benefit from engagement at any level with the net-
work resources, making it possible for researchers with diverse inter-
ests beyond aging to participate.
Summary
The successful translation of therapies that target fundamental aging 
processes into routine clinical interventions could transform the 
practice of medicine and human health (55). A number of candi-
date drugs (many already FDA-approved for other indications) have 
shown promise in preclinical studies. This Geroscience Network 
retreat developed ideas for proof-of-concept clinical trials that could 
be the next step in translating interventions that target fundamen-
tal aging processes into clinical practice. We described three frame-
works for proof-of-concept trials, targeted at age-related diseases, 
geriatric syndromes, and resilience to acute stressors. Some aspects 
of clinical trial design are common to all three, whereas some require 
unique consideration in each framework. Importantly, proof-of-
concept clinical trials would serve to test and advance the “gerosci-
ence hypothesis” that targeting the fundamental biology of aging 
will affect a range of age-related outcomes. Trial outcomes would 
be multidimensional and include outcomes related to the mechanism

 of action of the intervention; specific to the disease, syndrome, or 
stress under study; related to off-target effects of the intervention; 
and broadly relevant to the mechanisms and physiology of aging. 
Finally, several concrete steps could greatly accelerate the progress 
of clinical trials of interventions that target basic aging processes, 
including the development of standardized templates for trial design, 
toolkits for standardized outcome measurements, the establishment 
of a national geroscience biobank, and the development of specialist 
trial and training centers in the Geroscience Network.
