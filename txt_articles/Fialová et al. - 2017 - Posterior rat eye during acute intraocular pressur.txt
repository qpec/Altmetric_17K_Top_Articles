Abstract: Polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) operating at 840 
nm with axial resolution of 3.8 µm in tissue was used for investigating the posterior rat eye 
during an acute intraocular pressure (IOP) increase experiment. IOP was elevated in the eyes 
of anesthetized Sprague Dawley rats by cannulation of the anterior chamber. Three 
dimensional PS-OCT data sets were acquired at IOP levels between 14 mmHg and 105 
mmHg. Maps of scleral birefringence, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) retardation and 
relative RNFL/retina reflectivity were generated in the peripapillary area and quantitatively 
analyzed. All investigated parameters showed a substantial correlation with IOP. In the low 
IOP range of 14-45 mmHg only scleral birefringence showed statistically significant 
correlation. The polarization changes observed in the PS-OCT imaging study presented in this 
work suggest that birefringence of the sclera may be a promising IOP-related parameter to 
investigate.

1. Introduction 
Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies characterized by progressive loss of axons and 
retinal ganglion cells associated with visual field loss. The disease can be divided into several 
types: open-angle glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma, normal-tension glaucoma, congenital 
glaucoma and another variants [1]. Common to all of them is the damage of retinal ganglion 
cells and the fact that lowering of the intraocular pressure (IOP) slows the progress of the 
disease [1]. Therefore, there is evidence that IOP is important in this disease, although its 
contribution to the pathogenesis of glaucoma still requires more investigation [1]. The sclera, 
as protective shield of the eye, was hypothesized to play a key role in optic nerve head (ONH) 
damage [2]. At increased IOP, the biomechanical and structural properties of the sclera are 
altered as was shown in previous studies [3,4]. Biomechanical properties of the sclera and the 
lamina cribrosa may to a certain degree explain why some patients are more sensitive to 
increased IOP than others [5]. As such, there is considerable interest to study alterations of the 
sclera associated with increased IOP and understand their role in the pathogenesis of 
glaucoma. 
Anterior and posterior segment sclera were previously imaged in vivo in humans using 
polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT). PS-OCT enables the 
measurement of optical tissue properties, such as the birefringence caused by collagen fibers 
in the sclera or by axons in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) [3,6–9]. While in-vivo 
clinical studies allow the diagnosis and monitoring of physiological and pathological states, 
only limited interventions can be done in humans. Hence, to deepen the understanding on the 
effects of the IOP level on the posterior eye, animal studies are beneficial. 
Studies investigating the sclera ex vivo and in animal models were performed by various 
groups [3,10–16]. Main target of these investigations was the change of structural properties, 
e.g. collagen organization of the sclera as a response to different stress levels. This allows 
studying the elasticity and thus the mechanical properties of the sclera. In vivo animal studies 
were mainly performed during an artificially induced increase of the IOP (e.g. by cannulation 
of the eye). OCT and its functional extensions hereby enable the determination of various 
structural and functional parameters in vivo. Retinal perfusion at various IOP levels was 
studied using OCT-based optical microangiography [17–19]. The ONH and the optic nerve 
itself were studied under physiological conditions [20] and after IOP elevation using 
conventional OCT [21,22]. Reflectivity and thickness changes of retinal layers were reported 
[23,24]. 
We recently developed a high resolution PS-OCT system for small animal imaging [25]. 
With our prototype we can assess a threefold image contrast: morphological information 
based on reflectivity, polarization information resulting from polarization properties of the 
tissue structure and motion contrast based on the movement of the blood cells in vessels. The 
system was previously used to investigate healthy pigmented and non-pigmented rodents [25] 
as well as longitudinal retinal changes in a mutant mouse model of retinal and choroidal 
neovascularization [26]. In this article, the system was used for investigating the retina and 
the sclera during experiments with acutely increased IOP in non-pigmented Sprague Dawley 
rats. Hereby, quantitative parameters were determined and comprise information about 
changes in the morphology, e.g. deformation of the ONH, together with polarization 
properties such as scleral birefringence. Since earlier studies [17–19] already investigated the 
                                                                           Vol. 8, No. 1 | 1 Jan 2017 | BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS 301 
 microvascular response to an acute IOP increase, we exclusively focus on changes of tissue 
morphology and polarization properties in this article. Furthermore, ex vivo micro-computed 
tomography (µCT) was performed to identify anatomical relations in and around the eye ball. 
This work demonstrates the potential of OCT and its functional extensions to study tissue 
microstructures with intrinsic contrast in preclinical studies through quantitative evaluation of 
optical tissue properties. The experiment extends the aforementioned in vivo studies 
addressing IOP elevation and underscores the promising role that PS-OCT might play for 
further deepening the understanding of the causal relationship of distinct ocular structures in 
the pathogenesis of ophthalmic diseases. 
2. Methodology 
2.1 High resolution polarization sensitive OCT 
For this study, a spectral domain PS-OCT with high axial resolution was used, as depicted in 
Fig. 1. The system is described in detail elsewhere [25], here we provide just a brief 
description. The central wavelength of the system was 840 nm, the spectral bandwidth was 
100 nm and the A-scan rate was 83 kHz. Axial resolution in tissue (n = 1.35) was measured as 
~3.8 µm. All the cross-sectional images (B-scans), if not stated differently, were calculated as 
an average of 15 frames (5 frames repeated at one position, three consecutive positions 
separated by a distance of ~4 µm) for speckle reduction and signal to noise ratio 
improvement. The field of view was 30° × 30° which corresponds to approximately 1.5 mm × 
1.5 mm on the retina. 
2.2 Animals 
Five male Sprague Dawley rats (albino, age range: 9 – 10 weeks) were purchased from the 
Medical University of Vienna breeding facility, Himberg, Austria. The average weight of the 
animals was 366 ± 34 g. Animals were kept under controlled lighting conditions (12 hours 
dark, 12 hours light) with food and water ad libitum. For the experiments, the animals were 
anesthetized using midazolam (Dormicum, Roche, Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria, 1.0 ml/kg 
body weight), medetomidine (Domitor, Bayer Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria, 0.2 ml/kg 
body weight), fentanyl (Fentanyl, Hameln Pharma Plus GmbH, Hameln, Germany, 0.3 ml/kg 
body weight) and ketamine (Ketasol; aniMedica GmbH, Senden, Germany, 0.1 ml/kg body 
weight). Eye drops (Oculotect, Novartis Pharma; Vienna, Austria) were applied to the rodent 
cornea during the measurements. Tropicamide (Mydriaticum; Agepha Pharmaceuticals, 
Vienna, Austria; topical) and phenylephrine (2.5%, topical) were used for pupil dilation. The 
animals were sacrificed by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Release, Richter Pharma 
AG, Wels, Austria) at the endpoint of the experiment. All experiments were performed in 
accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the 
Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the ethics 
committee of the Medical University of Vienna and the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science 
and Research (protocol number GZ 66.009/0005-WF/V/3b/2016).

2.3 IOP experiment 
In order to ensure the integrity of the eyes to be investigated, anesthetized animals were first 
imaged at their physiologic IOP prior to cannulation. Subsequently, the IOP was elevated in 
the right eye by cannulation of the anterior chamber with a needle (31 G) connected to a 
reservoir filled with 0.9% NaCl solution. A pressure transducer was connected between the 
needle and the reservoir as is illustrated in Fig. 1(A). In order to elevate the IOP, the reservoir 
was placed at different heights (ranging from 20 cm to 140 cm in respect to the eye) with 
increments of 5 mmHg (until 45 mmHg) and 10 mmHg (after 45 mmHg). The IOP level was 
hereby altered in a range of 14 to 105 mmHg and determined by the transducer connected 
between the reservoir and the rat eye. Denser sampling for the range until 45 mmHg was 
chosen since this range is usually used in longitudinal studies [27–30]. The time interval 
between the measurements at different IOP levels was approximately 4 minutes. Two 
additional measurements were performed 4 and 14 minutes after the IOP was lowered back to 
14 mmHg at the end of the experiment. 
2.4 Depression of the ONH 
The internal limiting membrane (ILM) was automatically segmented in all data sets and its 
position was aligned according to the initial data set at 14 mmHg. Then, the difference 
between the average position of the ILM in an annulus (300 µm inner diameter, 700 µm outer 
diameter) centered at the ONH was calculated between the first measurement and successive 
measurements (i.e. 14 mmHg – 20 mmHg, 14 mmHg – 25 mmHg, and so on). The size of the 
annulus was chosen such that it contained only a confined peripapillary area, where the 
depression was present for every data set. Finally, the average of these values over 5 animals 
at each pressure was calculated. 
2.5 Reflectivity changes of the RNFL 
Relative reflectivity changes in the RNFL were evaluated as a ratio of the linear intensity in 
the RNFL and the linear intensity in the posterior retina (RNFL border until retinal pigment 
epithelium - RPE) [31], henceforth denoted as relative RNFL/retina reflectivity. Since the 
                                                                           Vol. 8, No. 1 | 1 Jan 2017 | BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS 303 
 segmentation of the posterior border of the RNFL was error-prone at high IOP levels 
(decrease of RNFL contrast in the reflectivity, see Fig. 2(I), 2(J), 2(M), 2(N) pink arrows), the 
ratio was calculated between a slab of tissue starting at the ILM with a thickness of 20 pixels 
(38 µm) and a slab of tissue starting 20 pixels (38 µm) posterior to the ILM and the RPE. The 
average reflectivity ratio was determined in an annulus with 550 µm inner diameter and 870 
µm outer diameter centered at the ONH. The size of the annulus was defined in a way that it 
did not contain the ONH and that it fit in every data set (small variations in the eye position 
led to a slight shift of the field of view between measurements). 
2.6 Retardation of the RNFL 
RNFL retardation was calculated as described earlier [25] and thus is just described briefly as 
follows. In averaged reflectivity images, the ILM was segmented and its polarization state 
was used for corneal birefringence compensation [32]. After that, the segmented ILM position 
was moved by 20 pixels (38 µm) in posterior direction and average phase retardation was 
calculated in the slab 75 pixels (143 µm) below the segmentation line. Only pixels above an 
empirically chosen threshold (3 dB above the average noise level) were used for the 
calculation. Some data sets were excluded from the analysis, since not enough pixels met this 
criterion. Average retardation was then calculated in an annulus (550 µm inner diameter, 870 
µm outer diameter). Since with increasing pressure, the reflectivity of the RNFL with respect 
to the retinal layers was changing (low contrast to adjacent layers, see Fig. 2(I), 2(J), 2(M), 
2(N), pink arrows), it was not possible to reliably evaluate neither thickness nor birefringence 
of the RNFL. 
2.7 Birefringence of the sclera 
Scleral retardation was evaluated in a slab with an upper border 20 pixels (38 µm) posterior to 
the RPE (thereby excluding the choroid) and a thickness of 40 pixels (76 µm) indicated by red 
lines in Fig. 2. The thickness of the slab did not include the full depth of the sclera, but rather 
its anterior half. This was because the unambiguous range for retardation measurements is 
restricted to 0° - 90° due to the algorithm used [33]. Since the sclera is strongly birefringent, 
retardation values may exceed 90° at deeper locations and may then be wrapped below 90° 
again, see Fig. 2(O). In order to avoid such regions in the cumulative retardation 
measurements, only the aforesaid shallow slab of 40 pixels was used for birefringence 
calculations. For scleral birefringence measurements, corneal birefringence was compensated 
as for the RNFL retardation measurements described in section 2.6 (no additional RNFL 
birefringence compensation was performed). Similar to previous investigations, we assumed 
that retardation was linearly increasing with depth in the sclera and hence effective 
birefringence was calculated as the slope of a linear fit of phase retardation along each A-scan 
in this slab [34]. The birefringence values from all A-scans in the 3D data set were then 
displayed as en face birefringence map, see Fig. 2(C), 2(D). The average birefringence was 
finally calculated in the same annulus as described above (550 µm inner diameter, 870 µm 
outer diameter). 
                                                                           Vol. 8, No. 1 | 1 Jan 2017 | BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS 304

2.8 Ex vivo µCT imaging 
Ex vivo µCT imaging was performed using a microXCT-400 (Carl Zeiss X-ray Microscopy, 
Pleasanton, CA) and a 0.4 × lens. The complete separated rat head was fixed in 
paraformaldehyde for 72 hours and washed in distilled water. To assess skull morphology, the 
unstained sample was scanned at 40 kV source voltage and 200 µA intensity. Projections 
were recorded at 3 s exposure time (camera binning = 4) and an angular increment of 0.25°. 
Reconstructed slices measured 512 × 512 pixel. Isotropic voxel resolution of reconstructed 
volumes was ~68 µm. 
To assess morphology of soft tissues, the specimen was cut along the median sagittal 
plane using a band saw. The left half of the head was dehydrated in absolute ethanol and 
stained using 1% elemental iodine in absolute ethanol [35] for 14 days. Before scanning, the 
specimen was washed in absolute ethanol for 24 hours to remove unbound iodine from the 
tissues. The specimen was scanned at 130 kV source voltage and 60 µA intensity. Projections 
were recorded at 5 s exposure time (camera binning = 2) and an angular increment of 0.17°. 
Reconstructed slices measured 1024 × 1024 pixel. Isotropic voxel resolution of reconstructed 
volume was 18 µm. 
The two µCT image stacks were exported in DICOM format and imported into Amira 6.1 
(FEI Visualization Sciences Group, Mérignac Cédex, France) where they were co-registered 
based on normalized mutual information using the RegisterImages tool. Image segmentation 
of external eye muscles, the optic nerve, and the optic nerve sheath was done using manual 
segmentation tools. Based on image segmentation, models were created using the 
                                                                           Vol. 8, No. 1 | 1 Jan 2017 | BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS 305 
 GenerateSurface tool and visualized by combined volume rendering of the skull (based on the 
µCT scan of the unstained specimen) and surface rendering of muscle models. 
2.9 Statistical evaluation 
To evaluate the correlation between measured parameters and the IOP, Spearman's correlation 
coefficient ρ was used which is applicable for monotonic relations. If the absolute value of ρ 
was in the range 1.00 – 0.70 it was considered as strong correlation, in the range 0.70 – 0.50 
as moderate correlation and in the range 0.50 – 0.30 as weak correlation, respectively [36]. To 
evaluate statistical difference between superior and inferior halves of the sclera, Wilcoxon 
rank sum test was used (Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox in Matlab R2014b). P-
values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
3. Results 
3.1 Cupping of the ONH 
Cupping of the ONH is depicted in Fig. 3 in 3D fashion together with en face depression 
maps and the average depression difference (difference of the ILM position between baseline 
and set pressure after the alignment for axial motions) plotted against IOP for 5 animals. 
Exemplary depression maps for one animal are shown in Fig. 3(B) as a response to an 
increase in IOP from 14 to 95 mmHg. An apparent ONH extrusion is visible as a color change 
from yellow to green for pressures higher than 45 mmHg. The average depression difference 
evaluated in a circular annulus around the ONH for all evaluated animals is shown in the 
graph of Fig. 3(C) and individual values in Fig. 3(D). The average depression difference, in 
relation to the initial measurement at 14 mmHg, at the highest IOP of 105 mmHg was 15 µm 
± 11 µm. After setting the IOP back to 14 mmHg, ONH cupping was diminished already after 
4 minutes and was even more reduced in the second measurement at 14 mmHg after 10 
additional minutes. 
3.2 Identification of the scleral sling at severely elevated IOP 
As the IOP increased, the reflectivity of retinal layers was changing. RNFL intensity 
decreased such that sometimes it was not possible to distinguish between RNFL and inner 
plexiform layer (IPL) due to a reduced contrast, see Fig. 2(J), 2(N). 
Under physiologic IOP, the retinal and scleral parts of the ONH were not visible very well 
due to shadowing by the retinal vessels. However, when IOP increased, blood perfusion was 
reduced and vessel diameters decreased. Thus less blood blocked the light beam which 
resulted in improved visibility of the scleral part of the ONH, see Fig. 2(I)-2(J). Also, the 
scleral rim around the ONH became more visible, and we were able to distinguish the sclera 
between the central retinal artery and optic nerve, see Fig. 4(C). The so-called scleral sling, 
which was previously reported in a histological study [20], can clearly be identified in the PS-
OCT phase retardation images.

3.3 Changes of the scleral birefringence 
Exemplary phase retardation B-scans are depicted in Fig. 2(G), 2(H), 2(K), 2(L), 2(O), 2(P). 
From such phase retardation images, scleral birefringence was calculated as described in 
section 2.7. Figure 5(A) shows rendered reflectivity data sets at various IOP levels together 
with scleral birefringence maps. Figure 5(B) shows exemplary scleral birefringence maps as a 
response to IOP changes from 14 to 95 mmHg and the annulus used for the calculation of 
average circumpapillary scleral birefringence. The average circumpapillary birefringence 
values from 5 animals are plotted in Fig. 5(C). Scleral birefringence was increasing as IOP 
was elevated and reached a plateau like phase at ~45 mmHg, see Fig. 6(A), where an average 
birefringence of 1.16 ± 0.04 °/µm was observed. After lowering IOP back to 14 mmHg, 
scleral birefringence did not promptly return to the initial values, not even at the second 
measurement after 10 additional minutes, except for one data set. This data set suffered from 
decreased image quality due to ocular deformations induced by the experiment for the last 
two measurements which could have affected quantitative birefringence measurements. In 
Fig. 6(A), scatter plots of all measured values (except for the final two measurements taken 
after reducing IOP back to 14 mmHg again) are shown together with plots of measurements 
where the pressure was lowered back to 14 mmHg. Each colored dot represents the 
birefringence value retrieved from one 3D data set. Scleral birefringence exhibits a moderate 
                                                                           Vol. 8, No. 1 | 1 Jan 2017 | BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS 307 
 positive correlation with IOP (ρ = 0.66; p = 2.82 × 10−9). Scleral birefringence also showed a 
positive correlation in the range of 14 – 45 mmHg (ρ = 0.75; p = 2.33 × 10−7). This IOP range 
was investigated separately since it has been frequently used in longitudinal glaucoma model 
experiments [27–30]. The average birefringence increase in this range was 2.75 × 10−2 
°/µm/mmHg, corresponding to a dimensionless birefringence increase of 6.42 × 10−5 mmHg−1 
at 840 nm wavelength. There was no significant difference in birefringence between the 
superior and inferior halves of the annulus (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.4418).

vessels (scleral sling). 
3.4 Changes of the RNFL retardation and reflectivity 
The RNFL retardation was evaluated in a slab of the posterior retina as depicted in Fig. 6(B). 
Retardation changes as a response to IOP elevation are shown as the mean for 4 animals as 
well as in the scatter plot of Fig. 6(B). The correlation analysis revealed a weak correlation 
between RNFL retardation and IOP (ρ = 0.39; p = 7.48 × 10−3). In the range of 14 – 45 
mmHg, we did not find any statistically significant correlation (ρ = −0.16, p = 0.42). 
In contrast, the reflectivity of the RNFL was changing substantially when IOP was 
elevated, see Fig. 2. The relative RNFL/retina reflectivity was evaluated as depicted in Fig. 
6(C) where the red slab corresponds to the RNFL region and the blueish slab to the posterior 
retina region. The reflectivity ratio showed a moderate negative correlation with IOP (ρ = 
−0.51; p = 1.79 × 10−5), see Fig. 6(C). No statistically significant correlation was found in the 
range of 14 – 45 mmHg, (ρ = −0.32; p = 0.06). The quantitative parameters as a response to 
IOP elevation are summarized in Table 1. 
                                                                           Vol. 8, No. 1 | 1 Jan 2017 | BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS 308

just one animal.

column, the mean quantities ( ± standard deviation - STDEV) are plotted. All data points are 
plotted in the right column, where each dot represents the respective quantity for one animal at 
a given IOP. Measurements after lowering the IOP back to 14 mmHg are excluded from these 
plots. Linear regressions are shown for the lower IOP range of 14 – 45 mmHg. Value marked 
by asterisk was retrieved just from one data set. 
3.5 Ex vivo µCT imaging of the rat eye and head 
Due to the absence of pigmentation in the Sprague Dawley rat, OCT can deeply penetrate into 
the posterior parts of the rat eye and thus the sclera was nicely visualized in all experiments. 
Sometimes, the deep penetration also revealed structures even beyond the sclera (see, for 
instance, Fig. 2(F)). To investigate the anatomical structure and validate the scleral structure 
visualized by PS-OCT in vivo, ex-vivo µCT imaging was performed for one rat after the 
endpoint of the experiment. 
A transverse slice through the rat eye imaged using µCT is shown in Fig. 7(A). Posterior 
to the eye, orbital muscles and the Harderian gland are visible. The nerve sheath which is 
surrounding the optic nerve is noticeable. These structures are in direct contact with the outer 
sclera. A 3D rendering of the rat skull is shown in Fig. 7(B)-7(D). The orbital muscles are 
segmented (red; dark red) together with the optic nerve (white) as well as the nerve sheath 
(grey). The interconnection of nerve sheath and sclera corresponds to the location of high 
scleral birefringence as shown in Fig. 7(E).

4. Discussion 
In this article, a rat model of short term IOP elevation was investigated using high resolution 
PS-OCT. This imaging method was demonstrated by our group to be capable of investigating 
the peripapillary sclera of healthy albino rats [34] and the retina of healthy albino and 
pigmented rats and mice [25] in the past. There, it was shown that PS-OCT can access 
birefringence of sclera and RNFL in rodents. 
Ex vivo measurements of scleral birefringence and in vivo measurements of various 
parameters in rat models of increased IOP were performed by several groups previously. 
Reflectivity and thickness changes of retinal layers (such as the ganglion cell layer) [24,37,38] 
were reported as well as perfusion changes [19] and functional changes [39]. With this article, 
we strived to extend the knowledge with in vivo measurements of polarization properties of 
posterior eye structures at elevated IOP. 
In this study, we performed a quantitative evaluation of the ONH depression as a 
difference between average ONH position in the measurement at 14 mmHg and of elevated 
IOP up to 105 mmHg. When plotted against the IOP, above ~45 mmHg the change is more 
apparent, depression rises and finally goes back when the IOP is lowered to 14 mmHg again, 
see Fig. 3. Below 45 mmHg, the change oscillates around zero, which can be accounted to the 
small imperfections in co-registration of the data sets. Detectable displacement of the ONH 
surface was also noticed by Fortune et al. [40] and recently published in a detailed study of 
neural rim tissue compression in nonhuman primates [41]. In addition, the result of the latter 
study showed that the thinning of the ONH neuroretinal rim is more pronounced than the 
thinning of the peripapillary RNFL tissue. In another study in rodents [21], where retinal 
thickness around ONH was evaluated at IOP 15 mmHg, 50 mmHg and 70 mmHg, decreased 
                                                                           Vol. 8, No. 1 | 1 Jan 2017 | BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS 311 
 retinal thickness in the area around Bruch’s membrane opening was reported. However, 
displacement of the ONH itself was not quantified. Our findings are in strong agreement with 
results of Zhi et al. [18]. They described ONH contour change qualitatively at various IOP 
levels (10 mmHg – 100 mmHg) in rats and reported that contour change was not apparent 
until ~50 mmHg. Above 60 mmHg, they reported retinal compression, distortion of retina and 
choroid and compaction of the ONH. Choh et al. [39] quantitatively evaluated Bruch’s 
membrane opening displacement (similar method used as in reference [18]) at IOP elevated to 
35 mmHg in rats. They reported significant displacement even at this comparatively low 
pressure. 
We investigated scleral birefringence as well as reflectivity changes and RNFL retardation 
simultaneously and evaluated their dependence on IOP. RNFL reflectance was observed to 
change before its thickness [42], and the most stable way to assess this change reliably was 
reported to be the ratio of RNFL/retina posterior to the RNFL [31]. Therefore, we used this 
parameter for the evaluation of reflectivity changes. We found that this parameter had 
moderate (negative) correlation with IOP (ρ = −0.51; p = 1.79 × 10−5). This correlation is in 
agreement with previous findings, where it was shown that reflectance of the RNFL has a 
strong directional nature [43]. 
Since birefringence is connected to the biomechanical properties of the sclera [11], the 
changes during the experiment most likely reflect changes in structural stiffness. Scleral 
birefringence showed moderate, positive correlation (ρ = 0.66; p = 2.82 × 10−9). The positive 
correlation of the scleral birefringence with increasing IOP differs from the finding reported 
by Yamanari et al. [3]. They observed a moderate negative correlation (Pearson's correlation 
coefficient = −0.63; p = 0.002) in the anterior segment of human sclera in vivo and no 
significant correlation in an ex vivo experiment with porcine eyes [3]. This difference 
between their results and those reported here could have several reasons. The mentioned study 
was performed on human eyes in vivo (physiologic range of IOP) and on ex vivo porcine eyes 
(controlled IOP). As such, birefringence was investigated in the anterior segment of the 
sclera. In contrast, in the study presented here, the posterior part of the sclera was investigated 
in vivo in rats. The scleral fiber alignment, which is responsible for the birefringence, in rat 
eyes depends on location [44], with a higher degree of orientation at the limbus than in 
peripapillary area. Around the ONH, the preferential orientation of the fibers is circular with 
its birefringence depending on the eccentricity [34]. In the anterior segment of the sclera, 
there is no surrounding structure acting against the expansion of the sclera when the pressure 
is increased. The expansion of the eye wall would account for the birefringence decrease, 
since the highly organized collagen fibers in the anterior eye are not only compressed in z 
direction, but also spread in the x-y plane. As the posterior sclera is less organized than its 
anterior part, tissue compression could result in higher organization of the fibers which would 
result in a birefringence increase. Also, posterior to the eye, structures such as muscles, 
Harderian gland, fatty tissue and optic nerve are densely packed (see Fig. 7) and therefore 
stiffness and compressibility of the surrounding are likely to influence the expansion of the 
eye. In an ex vivo µCT image of a rat head in Fig. 7, the relation between eye ball, ocular 
muscles and optic nerve is visualized. An interconnection of the optic nerve sheath with sclera 
can be identified in the posterior peripapillary region, see Fig. 7(D). Yamanari et al. [3] used a 
different wavelength in their experiment (1310 nm compared to 840 nm used in this study). 
But since the ultrastructure creating the form birefringence is much smaller than the used 
wavelengths, the outcome should not differ qualitatively. Therefore, the difference in our and 
their results should not be due to different wavelengths. It would be useful to investigate also 
the functional state of the retina [39] together with scleral birefringence in order to find out 
whether scleral birefringence correlates with functional damage of the retina and in particular 
of the ONH. Threshold for functional damage is around 30 mmHg [45]. 
Findings that the optic nerve is damaged focally in the superior area [46], that there is a 
greater loss of axons in superior retina [47] and that retinal thickness is reduced in the 
                                                                           Vol. 8, No. 1 | 1 Jan 2017 | BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS 312 
 superior quadrant [21] in rats were published in the past. Morrison et al. [48] suggested that 
the reason for these pathological alterations could be the central retinal vessels entering 
inferior to the optic nerve. This way, only the superior part of the ONH is in contact with 
sclera and scleral stress can be transmitted to the optic nerve. We did, however, not find any 
significant difference in birefringence between the superior and inferior half (Wilcoxon rank 
sum test, p = 0.4418). 
A weak correlation was found between RNFL retardation and IOP (ρ = 0.39, p = 7.48 × 
10−3), although the range of measured values (minimal value 8.3°, maximal value 9.5°) was 
rather small compared to the standard deviation inside the annulus volume of 5°. Since RNFL 
thickness could not be accessed reliably at increased IOP, it was not possible to tell if an IOP 
increase was accompanied by RNFL birefringence changes. Also, RNFL retardation values 
could be influenced by noise, since the values could not be thresholded according to the 
RNFL thickness as in our earlier work [25]. In that work, only retardation values in areas of 
RNFL thickness above 26 µm were mapped. It was, however, reported that RNFL retardation 
is changed in a non-human model of glaucoma [49,50] and in glaucoma patients [51–55]. 
This change was believed to be due to the progressive loss of retinal nerve fibers and/or 
changes in the injured axons. The short-term nature of our experiment was probably not 
sufficient to produce enough damage to the retinal nerve fibers even at highest IOP levels. 
In addition to the correlation of scleral birefringence, RNFL retardation and relative 
RNFL/retina reflectivity with IOP over the entire range of data points spanning from 14 to 
105 mmHg, we separately investigated the correlation for the IOP range from 14 mmHg to 45 
mmHg. In this range, scleral birefringence showed a stronger correlation with IOP than for 
the whole range of measurements. This suggests that the sclera does not produce a gradual 
change under increasing IOP, but the response rather has two phases: First a dynamic phase, 
where the birefringence changes rapidly with IOP and after that, a less dynamic, or plateau 
like phase, where birefringence stays rather constant or changes slowly. This is also visible in 
Fig. 6(A) and suggests that at IOP ~45 mmHg, the sclera reached the point where the 
biomechanical response to the increased IOP is slower or even stable and resembling the 
stress-strain hysteresis reported by Curtin [56]. The fact that scleral birefringence did not 
return to its baseline value after lowering the IOP back to 14 mmHg could mean that our 
waiting time was not sufficient for scleral recovery or even that the scleral microstructure 
might have been irreversibly damaged. To test this hypothesis, it would be interesting to 
investigate the scleral microstructure ex vivo in normal rats and in rats that have undergone 
acute IOP increase. RNFL retardation and relative RNFL/retina reflectivity exhibited no 
statistically significant correlation with IOP in this lower range of IOP values. 
In summary, the polarization changes observed in the PS-OCT imaging study presented in 
this work suggest that birefringence of the sclera may be a promising IOP-related parameter 
to investigate. As a next step, an animal study will investigate the effect of longitudinally 
increased IOP on the polarization properties of the retina and sclera. Finally, the results from 
this preclinical study may provide a basis for defining PS-OCT parameters for clinical 
imaging studies focusing on the peripapillary sclera in human glaucoma patients. 
5. Conclusion 
In this article, PS-OCT was used to study the impact of IOP on scleral birefringence, RNFL 
retardation and reflectivity changes in the retina. Both scleral birefringence and relative 
RNFL/retina reflectivity showed a similar correlation with IOP for the range of 14 mmHg – 
105 mmHg. RNFL retardation exhibited only a weak correlation with IOP in the same range. 
In the IOP range of 14 mmHg – 45 mmHg, RNFL retardation and relative RNFL/retina 
reflectivity did not exhibit a statistically significant correlation, whereas scleral birefringence 
showed moderate correlation with IOP. In contrast to the rather monotonous change of ONH 
cupping and the RNFL/retina reflectivity ratio, the response of scleral birefringence to the 
IOP increase could be split into two phases: a dynamic phase and a plateau-like phase.
