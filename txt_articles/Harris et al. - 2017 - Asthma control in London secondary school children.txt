ABSTRACT
Objective: The asthma control test (ACT) is a validated tool for assessing control in asthmatic children
aged 12 years and older. Using the ACT, we sought to assess asthma control and knowledge in London
secondary school children. Methods: Secondary schools in London, UK, participated in this study. Chil-
dren with doctor-diagnosed asthma were invited to complete an online questionnaire that included
the ACT and questions about asthma. Suboptimal asthma control was defined as an ACT score of �
19 out of a maximum score of 25. Data are summarised as median and interquartile range (IQR), and
were analysed by either Mann-Whitney test, or chi-square test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered
significant. Results: A total of 799 children completed the questionnaire; 689 (86.2%) were included
for analysis. Suboptimal asthma control was reported by 49.6% of students. Over a third (42.4%) of
students prescribed a short-acting β2-agonist inhaler felt uncomfortable using it at school, and 29.2%
(n = 173) reported not using this inhaler when wheezy. 56.4% (n = 220) of those with regular inhaled
corticosteroids did not take them as prescribed, and 41.7% did not know what this inhaler was for.
Suboptimal control was associated with a greater proportion of students reporting that they were
‘
somewhat’
, ‘
hardly’or ‘
not at all’comfortable using inhalers at school (52.7% vs 29.1%, p < 0.01) and
outside school (22.8% vs. 14.8%, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Suboptimal asthma control and poor asthma
knowledge are common in London schoolchildren.
Introduction
The aim of asthma therapy is to reduce morbidity and
mortality by achieving good control of asthma symptoms
[1]. However, the disproportionally high rate of asthma
deaths in UK children compared with other European
countries [2] indirectly suggests a high prevalence of poor
asthma control in the UK paediatric population. In order
to address this, an identification of children with sub-
optimal control is required, and in this subgroup, either
adjust therapy, or improve adherence, or a combination of
both [3]. One method suited to assessing asthma control
in large numbers of secondary school-age children is the
Asthma Control Test (ACT). The ACT consists of five
questions asking about the frequency of asthma symp-
toms, use of ‘
reliever’short-acting β2-agonists (SABA)
and the individual’
s own rating of their control over the
previous month [4]. The ACT is a reliable method for
assessing control [5], and is validated in adults and chil-
dren aged 12 years and above [4]. An ACT score of below
or equal to 19 reflects the cut-off with the best sensitivity
and specificity for predicting suboptimal asthma control

[5]. This cut-off is also associated with an increased risk
of urgent health care use for asthma over a subsequent six
months (adjusted odds ratio; 2.29 (95% CI 1.45 to 3.62))
[6]. Indeed, a recent European Respiratory Society Task
Force recommends that an ACT score of �19 in a child
should trigger more intense clinical monitoring [7].
To date, one community-based study has assessed
asthma control in UK children. This international study
administered, by telephone, the childhood asthma control
test (C-ACT; a 7-item questionnaire validated in children
of 4 to 11 years [8]) to families of asthmatic children aged
4 to 15 years. Overall, 40% of the 1284 children surveyed,
including 200 from the UK, had either parent-reported
(for children aged 4 to 15 years), or child-reported (for
children and young people aged 8 to 15 years) suboptimal
control by the C-ACT [9].
Current data on asthma knowledge in teenagers, and
its impact on asthma outcomes, are limited, due to
an absence of a validated measure to assess knowledge
in asthmatic patients. To date, there are no published
UK studies, which report asthma knowledge in children
and/or caregivers.

In the present study, we sought to assess asthma con-
trol in London schoolchildren, aged 11 to 18 years, using
an online questionnaire that included the ACT. We also
sought to assess knowledge of asthma therapies, adher-
ence to asthma therapies and the impact of asthma on
school life.
Methods
Secondary schools in 32 London boroughs were con-
tacted and were invited to participate. Contact was made
by email and letter, followed by a telephone call and an
email to a named science teacher if available. The Cen-
tre of the Cell at Queen Mary University of London and
University College London Partners provided additional
recruitment. All participants were required to be attend-
ing secondary school and have doctor-diagnosed asthma.
Of the 585 schools contacted, the majority (n = 541)
did not respond to the initial email or phone call. The
remaining non-participating schools (n = 19) expressed
an interest in participating, but could not accommodate
the research due to teacher workload, timetabling diffi-
culties or a lack of school resources.
The study was conducted between October 2014 and
October 2015. The online questionnaire (Online Supple-
ment) was delivered to students aged 11 to 18 years, who
were identified either by the school by formal register,
or by form teachers. Those students who were identi-
fied using the formal school register, the parents/carers
had informed the school of their child’
s asthma diagno-
sis when they started the school aged eleven. The ques-
tionnaire, with exception to the ACT, was not validated.
However, four focus groups were initially used to ensure
that the questionnaire was both user-friendly, and suit-
able for the target population. The first two focus groups
consisted of two young people and four young people,
respectively, without asthma, to test the website design
and accessibility. The final two workshops consisted of fif-
teen young people aged 13 to 17 years with asthma, and
fourteen young people with asthma aged 11 to 13 years to
test the content of the questionnaire.
The questionnaire was administered in schools in the
presence of the research team and a member of school
staff. Students were encouraged to clarify questions that
they did not understand. The questionnaire consisted
of five compulsory sections (i.e. each question had to be
completed before the website moved to the next ques-
tion) and one optional section. The compulsory sections
included the 5-item ACT (4), which assessed symptom
frequency, use of short-acting β2-agonists (SABA), night-
time symptoms and their perception of overall asthma
control over the previous month. An ACT score of 19
or less (from a lowest possible score of 5 to a highest
score of 25) indicates suboptimal asthma control [5]. The
online questionnaire also included self-report questions
about medication adherence, unplanned use of health-
care facilities, school attendance, smoking behaviour
and knowledge of the role of the spacer and preventer
inhaler. Throughout the questionnaire, the term ‘
reliever’
and ‘
preventer’inhaler was used instead of SABA and
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) ± long acting β2-agonists
(LABA) (Online Supplement). To help students identify
their medications, the questionnaire contained a list of
all possible medications and colour pictures of these
inhalers and oral tablets (both generic and branded). In
order to assist the students during the questionnaire, they
were encouraged to perform an internet search to assist
them in identifying their asthma treatments, or ask a
member of the research team for clarification. The ques-
tionnaire took approximately 15 minutes to complete,
and included multiple-choice knowledge questions about
the role of a spacer and the ICS ± LABA inhaler (called
‘
preventer’in the questionnaire). Five possible answers
about ICS ± LABA therapy and the role of spacers were
provided – only one of which was correct. How ‘
com-
fortable’students felt taking inhalers was measured on a
Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all comfortable) to 5
(completely comfortable).
The hypothesis tested by this study is that students
with suboptimal asthma control have increased school
absences due to asthma, greater unplanned medical atten-
tion and a reduced quality of life. In addition, we hypoth-
esised that students with suboptimal asthma control feel
less comfortable about using inhalers, both at school and
away from school, and that knowledge regarding preven-
ter medications is low in all students with asthma.
The study was approved by the Exeter Research Ethics
Committee (14/SW/0120), and required both parental
opt-out consent and student written assent.
Statistical analysis
This was an observational study; therefore, a power cal-
culation was not required. There was no upper limit
of schools; however, the sampling was limited by a
timeframe of one year. Since data were not normally
distributed, non-parametric analyses are used through-
out; quantitative questionnaire data are summarised as
median (IQR), unless indicated, and were analysed by
Spearman’
s correlation co-efficient, Mann-Whitney, or
chi-square test using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 23), A
p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Of the 585 London schools contacted, 24 agreed to
participate, and the questionnaire was administered in
all 24 schools (Figure 1). In six schools, a temporary

lack of internet connectivity prevented use of the online
questionnaire, and an identical paper version was used
instead. Since this paper version allowed students to
omit questions, 33 students omitted to answer one or
more of the questions needed for an ACT score, and
were therefore excluded. One hundred and six students
(8.5%) with complete ACT scores by paper questionnaire,
had missing data for other questions, but missing data
never exceeded 7% of the total responses for compulsory
questions (Table 1, and Online Supplement). Seventy-
seven students were excluded from the analysis as they
self-reported not taking any medication. The final sample
for analysis comprised 689 students (i.e. a response rate
of 51.5%).
In total, an ACT score was generated from 401 male
and 283 female students (median age; 13 years (IQR; 12
to 15 years, Table 1)). Five students chose to provide no
gender information (Table 1, and Online Supplement).
Twenty of the participating schools were comprehensives
(non-selective); thus, there were no entry requirements
or examinations (Table 2, and Online Supplement).
There were no missing data for ACT scores. Thirteen

participate were also comprehensive (Table 3, and Online
Supplement).
The majority of students (91.7%) were able to identify
their medication (s). However, 8.3% of students could not
identify what their medication was from the colour pic-
tures of inhalers provided and an internet search.
Suboptimal asthma control was reported by 342 stu-
dents (49.6%; Figure 2), and the overall median ACT score
was 20 (IQR; 16 to 22). Thirty-nine students (5.7%) scored
a maximum of 25 on the ACT (i.e. consistent with no
symptoms of asthma). Six hundred and thirty-four stu-

Twenty-four students reported that they did not have a
preventer inhaler, despite stating that they had one ear-
lier in the questionnaire; therefore, these students were
removed from the analysis. For those students who self-
reported being prescribed an ICS ± LABA (n = 390),
56.4% (n = 220) reported that they did not use this inhaler
as prescribed ‘
at least some of the time’
. Further, 19.2%
did not use ICS ± LABA ‘

, and 9.5% did
not use prescribed ICS ± LABA ‘

Data for this variable were missing from nine students.
The most frequent reason given for non-adherence to the
ICS ± LABA inhaler, reported by 92 students, was ‘
for-
getfulness’
, with students reporting that it was sometimes
difficult to remember to take their ICS± LABA due to dis-
tractions including getting ready for school in the morn-
ings, homework and extracurricular activities (Table 4).
When asked what an ICS ± LABA inhaler does, 41.7%
of children prescribed an ICS ± LABA gave an incor-
rect answer, out of five options (individual data in Online

these students, 52.5% used a spacer with all of their med-
ications. When asked about what the spacer does, 16.4%
could not identify the correct response.
At least one unplanned general practitioner (GP) /pri-

At least one whole school day absence was reported by
21.9% of students (n = 145). One or more lesson absence
was reported by 21.1% of students (n = 140). At least part

In questions regarding lifestyle and smoking, 34 stu-
dents reported that they smoked (23 of these with sub-
optimal control), and 24.8% of all students stated that
their parents, or someone living in their house, currently
smoked. Thirty-one students chose not to report their
smoking status, and twenty-nine students did not report
on whether their parents/carers currently smoked.
Suboptimal asthma control was associated with a
greater proportion of students reporting that they were
‘
somewhat’
, ‘
hardly’or ‘
not at all’comfortable using their
reliever inhaler at school (52.7% vs 29.1%, p < 0.01) or
outside school (22.8% vs. 14.8%, p < 0.01), and more stu-
dents with suboptimal control forgot their ICS ± LABA
preventer (57.0% vs. 55.5% p < 0.01). This is compared
with students with optimal asthma control. By contrast,
students with suboptimal control more often correctly
identified the correct answer about spacers (86.0% vs.
80.3% p < 0.01). Asthma control was not associated with
identification of the correct answer about the ICS ± LABA
inhaler. Gender and ethnicity were not associated with
suboptimal asthma control. A weak correlation was found
between age and ACT (r = .147, p < 0.01).
In students with suboptimal control, 42.4% judged
their asthma to be either ‘
well’or ‘
completely controlled’
.
The proportion of asthmatics with suboptimal control
was higher in non-selective (comprehensive) schools,
compared with selective (grammar and independent)
schools (52.3% vs. 41.7%, p < 0.05 (Table 2, and Online
Supplement)).
Discussion
In this study, we assessed asthma control in London sec-
ondary schools and found that over a third of children,
identified by their school as having doctor-diagnosed
asthma, had suboptimal control, and that more than 50%
of students self-reported that they did not use their ICS
± LABA ‘
preventer’inhaler correctly, at least some of the
time. There are no previous studies using the ACT in
schools in the UK. However, these results are compati-
ble with an international telephone-survey done in 2009
in a different population of children, which found 40%
of children (aged 4 to 15 years) with suboptimal asthma
control by the C-ACT [9]. To date, two studies have
recruited UK schoolchildren with asthma, but neither has
assessed asthma control. In one, McWhirter et al. [10]
assessed in primary schools, quality of life, spirometry and
inhaler technique [11]. In the other, Patterson et al. [11]
assessed in primary schools, asthma knowledge, school
attendance, daily well-being, perceived self-efficacy and
quality of life [10]. Patterson et al. [11] found that 57%
of parents claimed their children used preventers regu-
larly, and 54% of these claims were verified by the children
themselves during their assessments in school [11].
A strength of the present study is that, by assess-
ing asthma control in the school environment, we have
reduced the potential for students to be influenced by
overoptimistic parental expectations of control, as previ-
ously reported [9]. Children with asthma who do not have
a usual source of care, or who do not routinely visit their
physician could also be captured by recruiting through
schools. By including questions on knowledge of medica-
tions and allowing space for free text responses, our ques-
tionnaire provides insights into some of the drivers of sub-
optimal asthma control. First, overall knowledge about
ICS ± LABA and recognition of asthma symptoms was
poor, and knowledge was lower amongst students with
suboptimal control. This finding is compatible with previ-
ous reports of poor levels of knowledge amongst teenagers
with uncontrolled asthma [12]. Since we did not obtain
dose of ICS ± LABA, and the clinical reasoning for inhaler
therapy, we cannot determine whether suboptimal con-
trol is due to either inadequate prescribed treatment, or
poor adherence, or a combination of both. Some children
prescribed only a SABA and with a maximum ACT score
(i.e. no symptoms) may well have outgrown their asthma,
or have been mislabelled. However, this potential ‘
over-
treated’group represented, at most, 4% of students with
asthma.
A putative role of non-adherence in suboptimal con-
trol is suggested by the increased proportion of students
with suboptimal control who either forgot to take their
ICS ± LABA, or were uncomfortable in using inhalers –
or a combination of both. Over a third of students with
suboptimal control felt uncomfortable using their SABA
while at school. However, there is no evidence that knowl-
edge about asthma treatments is a driver of suboptimal
 1038

control, since students with an ACT �19 exhibited better
knowledge about both ICS ± LABA preventer inhalers
and the role of spacers. Indeed, free text responses sug-
gested that poor adherence, as previously reported [13], is
predominantly due to embarrassment regarding not con-
forming to social norms, forgetfulness and perceived bar-
riers due to extracurricular activities, such as homework.
These findings support the qualitative study of Naimi
et al. [14], who collected data on medication adherence
from 40 young people aged 15 to 18 years. Compatible
with the present study, Naimi et al. [14] reported that
‘
forgetfulness’and ‘
ambivalence’to use of their inhaled
medication were frequent in this age group, and that
many young people remained ‘
unconvinced on the effec-
tiveness’of their inhalers. A further possible reason for
non-adherence is over-estimation of control. Mammen
et al. [15] reported that teenagers with uncontrolled
asthma tend to normalise their symptoms and have
higher treatment thresholds. Similarly, we found that in
students with suboptimal control, 42.3% considered that
their asthma was either ‘
well’or ‘
completely controlled’
.
Similarly, the ‘
Asthma Insights and Reality in Europe’
survey [16] found that 32% to 49% of patients with severe
asthma symptoms, and 39% to 70% of patients with
moderate asthma symptoms believed that their asthma
was either ‘
well’
, or ‘
completely’ controlled. Overopti-
mistic assessment of asthma control and of outcomes is
of concern since the 2014 UK National Review of Asthma
Deaths [17] reported that deaths in children and young
people were associated with poor perception of the risk of
adverse outcome. Although parent-reported control was
not assessed in the present study, the ‘
Room to Breathe
Survey’[9] suggests that parents’perception of control is
even more optimistic than their own child’
s, since 73% of
parents described their child’
s asthma as mild or intermit-
tent, despite only 40% of children scoring 19 or less on the
C-ACT.
There are limitations to the present study. First, it
is unclear whether our data are generalizable to the
London/UK population since only 24 schools agreed to
participate, and these schools may have better asthma
support structures than non-participating schools. Gen-
eralizability is also limited by the increased proportion
of black and ethnic minority children compared with
the London population [18], albeit, this does reflect the
ethnic mix in some areas of London. Second, we did not
screen all children for asthma since ethics approval lim-
ited recruitment to doctor-diagnosed asthmatics either
on an official school register, or on an unofficial list. It
is therefore likely that some asthmatics did not receive
the invitation to participate. To date, there are no data on
asthma prevalence in London secondary school children,
but in Scottish primary schools, asthma prevalence is
14% [19]. The lower asthma prevalence of 4.6% in the
present study (with one school reporting only 12 asth-
matics out of 1256 students) suggests an under-reporting
of asthmatics in schools, and highlights a need for more
complete registration of asthmatics by schools. It may also
indicate a reluctance for children in secondary schools
to identify themselves as asthmatic. Third, responses
given by students may not have always been accurate
because the data is self-reported; thus, the reliability of
the findings may be limited. We reduced the risk of peer
pressure by ensuring that students were aware that all
responses were anonymous, and that peers could not see
their answers. However, it is also possible that inaccu-
rate responses were due to students not understanding
questions. To reduce this, we did extensive piloting of the
questionnaire with asthmatic children, and ensured that
research team members were available to assist students
throughout data collection sessions. However, free text
responses suggest that at least some students found the
term ‘
on purpose’ in the adherence questions (i.e. ‘
do
you sometimes miss your regular preventer inhaler on
purpose?’
) somewhat ambiguous. However, the majority
of free text responses suggest that students who recorded
‘
forgetting’to use their inhaler were making a conscious
decision to do so. Fourth, the total number of students
with asthma, as reported by schools was 1339; however,
799 students completed the questionnaire and 689 were
included for analysis (Figure 1). The discrepancy seen
between the total number of students and actual number
of students is due to parents opting out, student absence
on the day of the data collection and students opting out.
Some students were also working towards exams; there-
fore, they were unable to be excused from their lesson.
Finally, we did not link student’
s responses about asthma
morbidity with objective data such as unscheduled medi-
cal attendances for asthma recorded by schools. Although
we planned to do this, absences recorded by schools were
not accompanied by information about whether this was
due to asthma or due to other reasons.
Despite these limitations, we found that administering
the online questionnaire in schools, when combined with
opt-out consent, was an effective and acceptable way of
accessing asthmatic children. We therefore speculate that
schools are an important ‘
third space’for delivering inter-
ventions aimed at improving asthma control, and that any
school-based intervention should address asthma knowl-
edge, perceived peer pressure about inhaler use and the
establishment of a regular ICS ± LABA preventer inhaler
habit. Indeed, previous US studies suggest that targeting
knowledge of asthma in schools reduces unscheduled
primary care and hospital visits [20, 21]. In one of these
studies, Liptzin et al. [20] recently reported the results
of the ‘
Step-Up’Asthma programme, a multidisciplinary
 JOURNAL OF ASTHMA
1039
school-centred asthma program providing asthma coun-
sellors as a bridge between subspecialty asthma care,
primary care providers, school nurses and children with
asthma. Although not a randomized control trial, in
the 252 participants enrolled into the programme over
2 years, there were improvements in asthma knowl-
edge scores, inhaler techniques and a sustained drop in
exacerbations.
Conclusions
In summary, using an online questionnaire in schools,
we found a high prevalence of poor asthma control, poor
asthma knowledge and a high morbidity in London chil-
dren with doctor-diagnosed asthma. Since suboptimal
control by ACT is a risk factor for future severe exac-
erbations [6], and should prompt more intense clinical
monitoring [7], our results suggest a need for interven-
tions aimed at addressing poor asthma control in UK
schoolchildren.
