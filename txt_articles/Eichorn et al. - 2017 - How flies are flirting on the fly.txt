Abstract
Background: Flies have some of the most elaborate visual systems in the Insecta, often featuring large, sexually
dimorphic eyes with specialized “bright zones” that may have a functional role during mate-seeking behavior.
The fast visual system of flies is considered to be an adaptation in support of their advanced flight abilities. Here,
we show that the immense processing speed of the flies’ photoreceptors plays a crucial role in mate recognition.
Results: Video-recording wing movements of abdomen-mounted common green bottle flies, Lucilia sericata, under
direct light at 15,000 frames per second revealed that wing movements produce a single, reflected light flash per
wing beat. Such light flashes were not evident when we video-recorded wing movements under diffuse light.
Males of L. sericata are strongly attracted to wing flash frequencies of 178 Hz, which are characteristic of free-flying
young females (prospective mates), significantly more than to 212, 235, or 266 Hz, characteristic of young males,
old females, and old males, respectively. In the absence of phenotypic traits of female flies, and when given a
choice between light emitting diodes that emitted either constant light or light pulsed at a frequency of 110, 178,
250, or 290 Hz, males show a strong preference for the 178-Hz pulsed light, which most closely approximates the
wing beat frequency of prospective mates.
Conclusions: We describe a previously unrecognized visual mate recognition system in L. sericata. The system
depends upon the sex- and age-specific frequencies of light flashes reflecting off moving wings, and the ability
of male flies to distinguish between the frequency of light flashes produced by rival males and prospective mates.
Our findings imply that insect photoreceptors with fast processing speed may not only support agile flight with
advanced maneuverability but may also play a supreme role in mate recognition. The low mating propensity of
L. sericata males on cloudy days, when light flashes from the wings of flying females are absent, seems to indicate
that these flies synchronize sexual communication with environmental conditions that optimize the conspicuousness
of their communication signals, as predicted by sensory drive theory.

Background
Mate-seeking animals typically rely on sexual communi-
cation signals that facilitate mate encounters [1]. While
these signals can be diverse (olfactory, visual, acoustic,
vibratory, tactile) and may involve multiple sensory
modalities [2], certain taxonomic groups use specific
primary modalities of communication. Flies (Diptera)
have some of the most advanced visual systems in the
Insecta [3], often featuring large, sexually dimorphic eyes
with specialized “bright zones” [4–6] that may have a
functional role during mate-seeking behavior. The fast
visual system of flies [7] is considered an adaptation that
evolved in support of their advanced flight abilities [3], de-
manding superb visual acuity to gauge distance traveled
and to avoid collisions [3]. Blow flies (Calliphoridae) ex-
ploit visual cues when they forage [8], seek oviposition re-
sources [9], or pursue prospective mates [10]. Males have
larger eyes than females [6], suggesting that females send
and males perceive the visual signals or cues. Occupying
vantage points in their territories, males survey rapid fly-
bys of females and males, and then decide whether to fend
off rival males or pursue prospective female mates.
The design and processing speed of the flies’ com-
pound eyes allow us to infer functional linkage [11] of
the visual communication signals that females send and
males perceive. Blow flies possess rapid temporal visual
discrimination; the flicker fusion threshold (the fre-
quency at which blinking lights are perceived to be

 constant [12]) of the common green bottle fly Lucilia
sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae) exceeds 180 Hz [13],
and may double at temperatures above 30 °C, as shown
for the blue bottle fly Calliphora vicina [14], enabling
these flies to resolve extremely fast or brief visual stim-
uli. This ability has been interpreted as an adaptation to
support the flies’ advanced flight and collision-avoidance
capabilities [3]. If this adaptation were to function also
in mate recognition, one would expect an extremely fast
and specific visual signal produced by females. We show
that L. sericata males distinguish between the rates of
light flashes reflected off the moving wings of female
and male flies, and are most strongly attracted to flash
frequencies characteristic of young females that are pro-
spective mates.
Results
Our search for visual mate recognition cues took into
account that mate-seeking males pursue flying females.
To test whether wing movement of females affects mate
recognition by males, we mounted two live females side
by side (Fig. 1a), immobilized the wings of one randomly
assigned female and recorded the number of alighting
responses by males on or near each female. Significantly
more alighting responses by males on or near females
that could move their wings than on females that could
not (mean ± SE: 34.10 ± 3.76 vs. 20.60 ± 3.79; n = 10,
t = –4.43, t crit. two-tail = 2.26, P = 0.002; Fig. 2a;
Additional file 1: Data S1) revealed that wing movements
by females contribute to mate selection by males.
To visualize optic effects associated with moving wings
of L. sericata females, we video-recorded the wing
movement of abdomen-mounted flies under direct light
at 15,000 frames per second (Fig. 1b), and found that
wing movements produce a single, reflected, light flash
per wing beat (Fig. 3a–d). Such light flashes (strong light
reflections) were not evident (Fig. 3e–h) when we video-
recorded wing movements under diffuse light (Fig. 1c),
or when we took photographs of L. sericata wings out-
doors under a cloudy sky (Fig. 4a). Butterflies and blow
flies ([15], this study) exhibit low mating propensity on
overcast days when otherwise direct illumination from
the sun becomes diffuse [11, 16], and thus reduces flash
effects [17]. These observations support the hypothesis
that light reflected from the wings produces beacons
that contribute to mate recognition.

 We tested this hypothesis using two approaches. First,
we mounted two live female flies on an aluminum T-bar
(Fig. 1d), immobilized their wings, and illuminated each
female by a light emitting diode (LED) (Additional file 2:
Figure S1a), one that produced light pulses at 190 Hz
approximating the wing flash frequency of a flying fe-
male, and the other that produced constant light at the
same intensity. Second, we isolated the pulsed-light ef-
fects from phenotypic traits of female flies by mounting
one live female fly and one live male fly side by side
(Fig. 1d), immobilizing their wings and illuminating the
wings of the male by the 190-Hz light pulses while
keeping the wings of the paired female under constant
illumination. In both experiments, we placed the T-bar
with the two mounted flies into a bioassay cage contain-
ing 50 male flies and recorded the numbers of alighting
responses on either fly in each pair. In both experiments,
the female or male fly exposed to pulsed light (190 Hz)
received many more alighting responses (mean ± SE) by
males than did the fly illuminated by constant light (Exp.

 While these results support the hypothesis that light
pulses contribute to mate recognition, such signals or
cues can be functional in mate recognition only if they
differ in frequency by sex and age of free-flying individ-
uals. Only then would a male fly be able to distinguish
between rival males and prospective mates traversing his
territory. We tested this hypothesis by filming young
and old male and female flies in free flight, using a Phan-
tom Miro 3 high-speed camera at a rate of 15,325 frames
per sec. For each recording event, we placed 50 young
or 50 old male or female flies into a wire mesh cage fit-
ted with a cool-white LED. Following each recording,
which typically captured 1–6 flies in free flight, we pro-
ceeded to the next recording with a new set of flies in
another cage. Analyzing the video-recorded data files
(e.g.; Additional file 3: Video S1; Additional file 4: Video
S2), we found differences in the frequency of light
flashes reflected off the wings of free-flying young and
old females and young and old males (one-way ANOVA;
F3,46 = 96.22, P < 0.001; Additional file 1: Data S1). Young
females had a mean (± SE) flash frequency of 178.72 Hz
(±2.86 Hz), which was significantly lower than that of
young males (212.0 ± 4.18 Hz), old females (235.08 ±
2.58 Hz), and old males (265.78 ± 4.53 Hz) (Fig. 5a). Be-
cause L. sericata males seek young (2- to 4-day-old) fe-
males as prospective mates [18], the slower wing flash
frequency from young females than from young males,
or older individuals of either sex, could be a phenotypic
trait of reproductively capable females.
If the lower wing flash frequency of young females is
the key signal or cue for mate recognition by mate-
seeking males, one would expect males to respond to
this frequency even in the absence of live females and to
distinguish between flash frequencies that are true mate
cues (178 Hz; see above) and those that are not. By elim-
inating females from the experimental design, we iso-
lated the light flash effect as the test variable. We ran
four experiments in parallel and recorded alighting re-
sponses by males on paired black acrylic spheres (Fig. 1e)
instead of paired mounted female flies. Each sphere in
each pair held a white-light LED, one emitting constant
light, the other emitting light pulses at a frequency of

 290, 250, 178, or 110 Hz. The 250-Hz pulses represent
light flashes produced by flying old females and males
(see above). We selected 290- and 110-Hz pulses to test
the response of males to pulse frequencies that are well
above or below the wing flash frequencies produced by
flying conspecifics.
Males did not respond to light pulsed at 290 or
110 Hz in greater numbers than to constant light
(Fig. 5b). Spheres holding an LED emitting 250-Hz light
pulses received twice as many alighting responses by
males than did the spheres with an LED emitting con-
stant light (Exp. 6: 37.5 ± 4.97 vs. 19.37 ± 2.54; n = 8, t
crit. two-tail = 2.37, t = 4.59, P = 0.003; Fig. 5b). Spheres
with an LED emitting the 178-Hz pulses indicative of
prospective mates received not only 4.2 times more
alighting responses by males than did the paired
spheres with an LED emitting constant light (Exp. 7:
70.3 ± 8.93 vs. 15.67 ± 3.08; n = 9, t crit. two-tail = 2.31,
t = 7.21, P < 0.001) (Fig. 5b), but they also received sig-
nificantly more alighting responses than any of the
other light-pulsing LEDs (one-way ANOVA; F3,31 =
13.55, P < 0.001; Additional file 1: Data S1). Together,
these results reveal that L. sericata males do not simply
prefer pulsed light to a constant light, but also prefer
pulsed light that occurs at frequencies corresponding to
the wing flash frequency of young females that are pro-
spective mates.
To ascertain that L. sericata wing flashes are clearly
visible even in diverse natural habitats and thus can in-
deed function in mate recognition, we took photographs
of L. sericata wings exposed to direct sunlight in out-
door settings, and video-recorded at high speed free fly-
ing L. sericata exposed to direct sunlight. Sunlight-
reflecting stationary (mounted) wings produced bright
visible cues (Fig. 4b–f), appearing 2–3 times brighter
than the paired wing positioned at an angle not condu-
cive to reflecting the sunlight (Additional file 2: Figure
S1b). In laboratory measurements, the spectral power
distribution of light reflected by L. sericata wings closely
resembled that of the incident light (Additional file 2:
Figure S1c). Moreover, wings of L. sericata females free
flying in an outdoor setting produced repeated flashes of
light that contrasted well even against a complex back-
ground of plant foliage (Additional file 5: Video S3;
Additional file 6: Video S4).
Discussion
Moving wings are thought to mediate long-range detec-
tion of potential mates in some butterflies and damsel-
flies [17, 19, 20]. In these insects, light flash effects
coupled with other visual effects of moving wings such
as iridescence, UV, and polarized light reflections are hy-
pothesized to contribute to mate recognition. In our
study, we have decoupled light flash effects from other
effects of moving wings, demonstrating that male flies
respond to the light flashes per se when they seek pro-
spective mates. By showing that L. sericata males re-
spond to LED light pulses in the absence of females, we
provide evidence that the frequency of pulsed light is the
key mate recognition cue in L. sericata and that this cue
is independent of structural and color characteristics of
female wings.
Unlike static signals or cues, flashing signals affect im-
proved visibility [19, 21]. This is evident, for example, in
Morpho butterflies whose wings produce light flashes
that are reported to be visible from low-flying aircraft
[22] and in Heliconius butterflies whose wings produce
polarized light flashes that stand out in complex forest
habitats [20]. Compared to these butterfly light flashes,
the light flashes produced by L. sericata wings are not
only highly visible in direct sunlight (Fig. 4; Additional
file 5: Video S3; Additional file 6: Video S4), they are
also very rich in information content. Divergent flash
rates produced by young and old females (Fig. 5a), and
the males’ ability to “read” these rates (Fig. 5b), allow for
the conveyance of information that enables informed
mate assessment. Exploitation of “rate-based” signals or
cues may, in fact, be commonplace in the Insecta. For
example, rates of flashing light signals produced by bio-
luminescent fireflies likely convey important information
about mate suitability [12, 23].
Sensory perception of light flashes produced by mov-
ing wings seems to be facilitated by the functional de-
sign, neural circuitry, and processing speed found in the
sexually dimorphic compound eyes of several species of
flies. For example, males but not females of the blow fly
Chrysomya megacephala and the hover fly Eristalis
tenax have large ommatidial facets in their dorsal frontal
eye region [4, 5] that form a “bright zone” believed to be
capable of increased light capture. This bright zone is
not linked to enhanced resolution [24], but is deemed to
allow males to search for females at low light or from
great distances in bright light [24]. We hypothesize that
this bright zone may also help males detect the flashing
lights of prospective mates. Moreover, the fast photore-
ceptors of calliphorid flies [25] may not only underlie
adaptations of a visual system that has evolved to sup-
port advanced flight and collision-avoidance capabilities
[3], but also may enable a superior function in mate rec-
ognition. The temporal encoding ability of L. sericata
males was amply sufficient to distinguish between light
flash frequencies of prospective mates (178 Hz) and rival
males (250 Hz) (Fig. 5b). While numerical competence
is known for mammals [26, 27], amphibians [28], birds
[29], fish [25], and some invertebrates such as ants [30],
the numerical recognition and signal-processing speed
exhibited by L. sericata males seem to top currently
known records.

 The logical framework offered by the sensory drive
theory [11] predicts functional links between signal de-
sign and presentation such that signal conspicuousness
is maximized relative to background noise or environ-
mental conditions. Our data on L. sericata are in
complete agreement with this prediction. Unlike the iri-
descent light flashes produced by Hypolimnas bolina
butterfly wings [17] that are most conspicuous only from
a narrow perspective [17], the wing flashes produced by
flying L. sericata females are visible beacons (Fig. 4;
Additional file 5: Video S3; Additional file 6: Video S4)
that are detectable from all directions, allowing a terri-
torial male fly to rapidly notice a female irrespective of
her flight trajectory, particularly when he is perching at
a vantage point that optimizes contrast between fly flash
signals and background. Remarkably, the flash frequency
is so informative that it allows the territorial male to dis-
tinguish between old and young females, and to pursue
primarily young females that are preferred mates. Fur-
thermore, the low mating propensity of L. sericata on
overcast days, when diffuse sunlight renders light reflec-
tions off wings inconspicuous (Fig. 4a), appears to show
that these flies time their sexual communication and
mating activities in accordance with environmental con-
ditions that optimize the conspicuousness of their sexual
communication signals.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we describe a previously unidentified vis-
ual mate recognition system in the common green bottle
fly. The system depends upon both the sex- and age-
specific frequencies of light flashes reflecting off moving
wings, and the ability of male flies to distinguish be-
tween the frequency of light flashes produced by rival
males and prospective mates. Our findings imply that in-
sect photoreceptors with fast processing speed may not
only support agile flight with advanced maneuverability
but may also play a supreme role in mate recognition.
With emerging evidence that light flash mate cues also
occur in other insects (unpublished data), there may be
an opportunity for optimizing light traps for capture of
specific nuisance insects in urban and industrial settings.
Methods
Experimental insects
We reared L. sericata in the insectary at Simon Fraser
University, starting a new colony with field-collected
wild flies every 12 months. We cold-sedated flies within
24 h following eclosion, separated them by sex, and kept
them in groups of 50 males or 50 females in separate
wire mesh cages (45 × 45 × 45 cm; BioQuip®, Compton,
CA, USA) under a L16:D8 photoperiod, 30–40% relative
humidity, and 23–25 °C. We provisioned flies with water,
milk powder, sugar, and liver ad libitum and used 2- to
7-day-old flies in bioassays.
Responses by males to mounted females, one able to
wing-fan, the other with wings glued to her body
For each replicate of Experiment 1 (n = 10), we CO2-se-
dated two live female flies for 30 s, and then mounted
them with cyanoacrylate adhesive on their abdominal
ventrum, at opposite ends of a 7.5-cm-long aluminum
T-bar (Fig. 1a). We applied a small amount of cyano-
acrylate to the wing base of one randomly assigned fe-
male to immobilize her wings, and applied the same
amount of adhesive to the abdomen of the other female,
allowing her wings to move freely. We placed the T-bar
with the two females in a wire mesh bioassay cage (45 ×
45 × 45 cm; BioQuip®) containing 50 male flies. The cage
was illuminated from above with a full spectrum light
source (two horizontal fluorescent bulbs: Philips, plant
& aquarium (40 W); Sylvania, Daylight Deluxe (40 W))
(Additional file 2: Figure S1a). To minimize light reflec-
tion, we covered the metal cage floor and T-bar stand
with SunWorks® black construction paper and black
velvet (Suzhou Joytex International Co. Ltd., Jiangsu,
China), respectively. During each 40-min bioassay, we
recorded the number of alighting events by males on or
near a female followed by physical contact with her. We
analyzed the mean numbers of alighting responses by
males on females with wings either mobile or immobi-
lized by a paired two sample for means t-test.
Do moving wings produce flashes of reflected light under
point source illumination?
We recorded the wing movement of abdomen-mounted
male and female flies (Fig. 1b) in slow motion using a
Phantom Miro 4 camera (Vision Research, Wayne, NJ,
USA), recording at 15,000 frames per second, a 512 ×
512 pixel resolution, and a 20-μs exposure time. To illu-
minate the mounted fly, we used a white 100-watt LED
(6500 K; Zongshan Ltd., Guangdong, China) mounted to
a computer CPU heat sink for cooling (Thermaltake
Heatpipe, Thermaltake Technology
Co.
Ltd, Taipei,
Taiwan), and powered via a 32 V 5A stabilized, adjust-
able DC power supply (Gopher Technologies, Yantian,
Fenggang, Dongguan, Guangdong, China).
Do moving wings produce flashes of reflected light under
diffuse illumination?
We used the same high-speed video technology as de-
scribed above, except that we exposed the mounted fly
to diffuse instead of point source light. We placed the fly
inside a ping pong ball “diffuser” (Fig. 1c) and illumi-
nated it by four cool white 100-watt LEDs (see above).

 Responses by males to paired mounted females, both
with their wings immobilized but one with pulsed light
reflecting off her wings
For each replicate (n = 13) of Experiment 2, we mounted
two live female flies on an aluminum T-bar (Fig. 1d) and
immobilized the wings of each female with cyanoacrylate
adhesive. We illuminated one randomly assigned female
from above by a light emitting diode (LED, Optek Tech-
nology Inc., Carrollton, Texas 75006, USA) (Additional file
2: Figure S1a) mounted 3 cm above the female (Fig. 1d)
and which produced 5-Volt, white-light pulses at a fre-
quency of 190 Hz and a duty cycle of 3%. The pulse fre-
quency of 190 Hz was approximately mid-way between
the light-flash frequencies of flying 2-day-old female and
male flies. We illuminated the control female by a second
LED of the same type that produced constant light.
We considered two alternative approaches to the
illumination design of this experiment. We could have
set the pulsed-light LED and the constant-light LED to
deliver either equal total light intensity (root mean
squared) or equal maximum light intensity (peak volt-
age). We chose the latter (conservative) approach be-
cause, at a 3% duty cycle (“on” vs. “off” ratio), the
pulsed-light LED delivers only about 3% of the total light
that the constant-light LED delivers. Thus, to the human
eye, the pulsed-light LED appears as a constant dim
light, whereas the constant-light LED appears as a con-
stant bright light; to fly photoreceptors, in contrast, the
pulsed-light LED appears as an intermittent (pulsing)
light with a light intensity matching that of the constant-
light LED.
For each replicate, we placed the T-bar with the two
females into a wire mesh bioassay cage containing 50
male flies. During 40 min in each replicate, we recorded
the numbers of alighting responses by these 50 male flies
on each female, and analyzed the mean numbers of
alighting responses by a paired two sample for means
t-test.
Responses by males to paired male and female flies, both
with their wings immobilized, and pulsed light reflecting
off the male’s wings
In each replicate of Experiment 3 (n = 10), we mounted
one live female fly and one live male fly 7 cm apart on
an aluminum T-bar (Fig. 1d), and immobilized the wings
of each fly with cyanoacrylate adhesive. We illuminated
the male from above by an LED (Fig. 1d) that produced
5-Volt, white-light pulses at a frequency of 190 Hz and a
duty cycle of 3%. We illuminated the female by a second
LED of the same type that produced constant light at
equal maximum intensity as the first LED. During
40 min in each replicate, we recorded the number of
alighting responses by 50 males on the mounted male
and female fly, analyzing the mean number of alighting
responses on the male and female by a t-test.
Light flash frequencies associated with age and sex of
flying individuals
The objective of Experiment 4 was to determine whether
the numbers of light flashes reflected off the wings of
free-flying flies differ in accordance with age or sex. We
filmed 2-day-old (young) and 7-day-old (old) male and
female flies in free flight using a Phantom Miro 3 high-
speed camera (Vision Research) at a rate of 15,325
frames per second and a 34-μs exposure time imaged
through a Canon 100-mm f2.8 L macro lens (Canon
Canada Inc., Vancouver, BC V6C-3 J1, Canada) fitted to
a 36-mm extension tube. For each recording event, we
placed 50 young or 50 old male or female flies into a
wire mesh cage (45 × 45 × 45 cm) housing a 100-Watt
(approximately 9000 Lumen), cool-white (5000–6000
Kelvin) LED, which was driven by a 32-Volt switching-
power supply (model CPS-3010, Gopher Technologies,
Yantian,
Fenggang
Town,
Dongguan,
Guangdong,
China). Once the camera and light were turned on, we
lightly tapped the cage to induce take-off and flight by
resting flies. In video-recorded data files, we counted the
number of light flashes reflected within one second off
the wings of free-flying young females (n = 11), young
males (n = 12), old females (n = 18), and old males (n = 9),
and analyzed light-flash frequencies of young and old
females and of young and old males by one-way
ANOVA followed by the Tukey test for comparisons of
means.
Ability of males to discriminate between LED-pulsed light
of varying frequencies
To determine whether mate-seeking males can distin-
guish between different frequencies of pulsed light,
parallel-run behavioral Experiments 5–8 (n = 9, 8, 9, and
9, respectively) tested alighting responses by males on
paired black acrylic spheres (1.77 cm diameter; supplier
unknown; Fig. 1e). We mounted the spheres on clamps
12 cm apart and 12 cm above the floor of the bioassay
cage containing 50 male flies. A central hole (0.52 cm)
in each sphere accommodated an upward pointing LED
(Fig. 1e), the rounded lens of which was sanded down to
be flush with the sphere’s surface. Sanding the lens en-
sured that the emitted light was visible to flies from
many viewing angles rather than from the narrow view-
ing angle that the lens otherwise creates. By random as-
signment, one LED in each pair emitted constant light;
the other emitted light pulsed at 290 Hz (Experiment 5),
250 Hz (Experiment 6), 178 Hz (Experiment 7), or
110 Hz (Experiment 8). We selected the frequencies of
290 Hz and 110 Hz to test the response of males to
pulse frequencies that are well above or below the wing

 flash frequencies produced by flying common green bot-
tle flies. In each of Experiments 5–8, we analyzed the
mean numbers of alighting responses by males on paired
spheres holding LEDs emitting constant light or pulsing
light by a paired two sample for means t-test. We ana-
lyzed differences in alighting responses based on the fre-
quency of pulsed light by one-way ANOVA followed by
the Tukey test for comparisons of means.
Visibility of light flashes reflected off the wings of free-
flying flies video recorded outdoors under direct sunlight
To document the effect of sunlight reflecting off the
wings of a free flying L. sericata, we took high-speed
video recordings of flies traversing a south-facing slope
with plant cover under direct, mid-day sun under a par-
tially cloudy sky. For these recordings, we used a FAS-
TCAM Mini AX200 type 900 K-M camera (Photron
USA Inc., San Diego, CA 92126, USA) fitted with a
Canon macro lens (100 mm; f2.8 L) at f5.6, capturing
images at 15,000 frames per second, a 1/15000 exposure
time, and a 768 × 512 pixel resolution.
Effect of natural sunlight reflecting, or not, off L. sericata
wings
We carefully removed wings from a 1-day-old female fly,
mounted them on hemostatic clamps positioned by ar-
ticulated holders (Noga Engineering Ltd., Shlomi 22832,
Israel), and angled the wings such that the right wing,
but not the left wing, reflected sunlight back toward the
camera. We photographed the wings under cloudy con-
ditions (Fig. 4a) and under sunny conditions (Fig. 4b–f),
keeping the wings near minimum focus from the lens,
with various distances to background foliage. We took
the photographs with a Canon EOS 5D Mark II Full
Frame DSLR camera fitted with a Canon EF 100 mm
f2.8 L macro lens, using the following parameters: (1) 1/
50 sec exposure, f29; (2) 1/160 sec exposure, f18; (3) 1/
160 sec exposure, f22; (4) 1/80 sec exposure, f29; (5) 1/
125 sec exposure, f29; and (6) 1/60 sec exposure, f 29.
We converted RAW images to 16-bit uncompressed
TIFF files using open-source RAW image-decoding soft-
ware (DCRAW; [31]) in a manner that maintained pixel
linearity. We then examined the images in ImageJ [32],
separated the green color channel, manually selected
wings, and graphed histograms of pixel values.
Relative spectral power of light reflected off the wings of
immobilized female flies exposed to a 100-watt white-
light LED
We narrowed the field of view of a spectrometer
(HR4000, Ocean Optics, USA) attached to a cosine cor-
rector (CC-3-UV-S, Ocean Optics, USA), using a Ger-
shun tube constructed of matte black construction
paper. The tube extended 5 cm beyond the tip of the
cosine corrector and had a 6-mm opening. We posi-
tioned decoupled female L. sericata wings as described
above, keeping the wing and the aperture of the Gershun
tube 2 cm apart. At this distance, the spectrometer’s
field of view is limited to an 8-mm radius circle.
Through this approach, we could maximize the field of
view occupied by the wing. We took radiance spectra of
(1) the illuminating 100-watt white-light LED, (2) the re-
flection from the matt black velvet background behind
the wings, and (3) the reflectance of the wing oriented
to reflect or (4) to not reflect, light towards the opening
of the tube.
