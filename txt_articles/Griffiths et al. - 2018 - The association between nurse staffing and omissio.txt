Abstract
Aims: To identify nursing care most frequently missed in acute adult inpatient wards
and to determine evidence for the association of missed care with nurse staffing.
Background: Research has established associations between nurse staffing levels
and adverse patient outcomes including in-hospital mortality. However, the causal
nature of this relationship is uncertain and omissions of nursing care (referred as
missed care, care left undone or rationed care) have been proposed as a factor
which may provide a more direct indicator of nurse staffing adequacy.
Design: Systematic review.
Data Sources: We searched the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase and Medline
for quantitative studies of associations between staffing and missed care. We
searched key journals, personal libraries and reference lists of articles.
Review Methods: Two reviewers independently selected studies. Quality appraisal was
based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence quality appraisal checklist
for studies reporting correlations and associations. Data were abstracted on study
design, missed care prevalence and measures of association. Synthesis was narrative.
Results: Eighteen studies gave subjective reports of missed care. Seventy-five per
cent or more nurses reported omitting some care. Fourteen studies found low nurse
staffing levels were significantly associated with higher reports of missed care. There
was little evidence that adding support workers to the team reduced missed care.
Conclusions: Low Registered Nurse staffing is associated with reports of missed
nursing care in hospitals. Missed care is a promising indicator of nurse staffing ade-
quacy. The extent to which the relationships observed represent actual failures, is
yet to be investigated.

INTRODUCTION
The evidence of nurse staffing levels in hospitals and its association
with patient outcomes is extensive. However, several other factors
may affect outcomes throughout the period a patient stays in hospi-
tal. More recently, research has begun to explore missed nursing
care as a key factor leading to adverse patient outcomes. Missed
care has also been identified as a plausible indicator of hospital nurs-
ing care quality (Griffiths, Ball, et al., 2014; Griffiths, Dall’Ora, et al.,
2014). Worldwide predictions of a shortage of nurses by 2025, dri-
ven by retiring workforce and an ageing population, increases the
need to develop a deep understanding of the impact of nurse staff-
ing on patient safety. Furthermore, identifying the mechanisms and
all possible outcomes that can be affected by unsafe staffing in hos-
pital raises international interest.
1.1
|
Background
Low nurse staffing levels are associated with adverse outcomes in
hospitals, most notably mortality (Griffiths et al., 2016; Kane, Sham-
liyan, Mueller, Duval, & Wilt, 2007; Shekelle, 2013). While this evi-
dence has had significant impact and has been used to advocate for
increased nurse staffing levels, including mandatory minimums, the
causal link between nurse staffing levels and outcomes remains dis-
puted (Griffiths, et al., 2016). Certainly for most patient outcomes
the causal association can only be partial and indirect.
More recently, missed nursing care, defined as any aspect of care
that is omitted or delayed, in part or in whole (Kalisch, Landstrom, &
Hinshaw, 2009), has captured attention, with some evidence that it
may be associated with adverse patient outcomes (Carthon, Lasater,
Sloane, & Kutney-Lee, 2015; Lucero, Lake, & Aiken, 2010). Enquiries
into potentially avoidable deaths in hospital demonstrate how omis-
sions by nursing staff can lead to serious adverse outcomes. For
example, reports into avoidable deaths in hospital identify that a fail-
ure to measure patients’ vital signs, recognize the early signs of
deterioration, communicate abnormal observations and/or provide
an adequate response are frequently associated with avoidable
deaths (Dagmar, Kate, & Frances, 2007).
Consequently, omission in essential care, in particular surveillance
to identify and prevent deterioration, has been hypothesized as the
mechanism through which mortality rates are influenced by nurse
staffing levels (Clarke & Aiken, 2003). In the face of excessive work-
loads, nurses may be unable to complete all necessary care activities
and must, in effect, engage in what is described as “implicit ration-
ing” (Schubert, Glass, Clarke, Schaffert-Witvliet, & De Geest, 2007).
Missed nursing care has also been suggested as a potential quality
measure linked to the adequacy of nursing staffing (National Insti-
tute for Clinical Excellence, 2012; VanFosson et al., 2016), acting as
a leading indicator which could more sensitively indicate problems
arising from low staffing before they could be detected through
adverse outcomes (Ball, Murrells, Rafferty, Morrow, & Griffiths,
2014).
However, while evidence for the association between nurse staff-
ing levels and patient outcomes is considerable and has been exten-
sively reviewed, research on missed nursing care is more limited, in
part because nursing activities can be difficult to measure and are
often not routinely collected by healthcare providers (Lucero et al.,
2010). However, there is now a growing number of studies exploring
the link between nurse staffing and missed care. Previous reviews
have considered factors related to missed care but have not systemati-
cally explored the link with staffing (Jones, Hamilton, & Murry, 2015).

THE REVIEW
2.1
|
Aims
The aim of this review was to identify nursing care tasks most fre-
quently missed in acute hospitals’ adult inpatient wards and to deter-
mine evidence for the association of missed care with nurse staffing.
Two questions guided the review to reach the aims:
1. What are the nursing care tasks most frequently missed in acute
hospitals adult inpatient wards, as reported by staff or patients
or captured in administrative data?
2. What are the associations between missed care and nurse staff-
ing levels or skill mix in acute hospitals adult inpatient wards?
Why is this research/review needed?
� The role of nurse staffing to maintain patient safety was
recognized in the safe staffing guidelines for adult hospi-
tal wards produced by the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence.
� The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
has highlighted the need for more evidence on indicators
that more directly reflect the impact of nurse staffing on
patient outcomes.
What are the key findings?
� Low Registered Nurse staffing is associated with omis-
sion of essential care.
� Missed care is a promising indicator of nurse staffing
adequacy.
How should the findings be used to influence
policy/practice/research/education?
� Given the potential consequences of missed care, its
incidence/prevalence may serve as an indicator of care
quality.
� Maintaining adequate staffing levels is a mechanism to
avoid missed care.

Design
This was a systematic review of quantitative studies exploring asso-
ciations between nurse staffing levels and skill mix with missed care
in general medical/surgical wards in acute hospitals.
The review was conducted according to the review methods out-
lined in the guidance for the development of public health described
by NICE (2012). This approach was selected because we anticipated
that most research would be observational.
2.3
|
Search methods
Our search strategy was based on a comprehensive examination and
review of literature on nurse staffing (Griffiths, Ball, et al., 2014;
Griffiths, Dall’Ora, et al., 2014), supplemented by additional searches
for specific terms related to missed care (missed care, unfinished
care, implicit rationing, care left undone, task left undone) [see Sup-
porting Information for full search strategy]. Searches were per-
formed on CEA registry, CDSR, CENTRAL, CINAHL, DARE, Econlit,
Embase, HTA database, Medline including In-Process, NHS EED,
HEED and databases of grey literature (including the HMIC database
and those held by the National Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence [NICE]). Search dates were limited to studies published from
2006 when the term missed care was used in a study by Kalisch
(2006). Manual journal searches, literature from personal libraries
and reference lists were reviewed. Initial searches were undertaken
to June 2016. Additional searching during the final drafting of the
paper suggested no major new studies had been published subse-
quently, although we can only be confident of comprehensive cover-
age up to June 2016.
2.4
|
Search outcome
We included primary studies exploring the association between a
measure of nurse staffing (e.g. RN Hours per patient day or nurse
patient ratio) or skill mix (e.g. ratio of RN to all hands on carers) and
missed care (measured as scores or frequencies of nursing tasks, pro-
cedures or aspects of care missed or substantially delayed) in acute
care hospital wards. Studies undertaken exclusively in highly special-
ist units with atypical staffing (e.g. ICU) were excluded. Studies
reporting composite error rates that might include omissions (e.g.
medication errors) were excluded if the rate of omissions could not
be separated from other errors. We considered quantitative random-
ized or non-randomized controlled trials, prospective or retrospective
observational studies, and cross-sectional or longitudinal studies.
A single reviewer (AR) undertook initial screening of titles and
abstracts for relevance. Two reviewers independently scrutinized the
list of potentially relevant studies and identified studies for inclusion.
Disagreements were resolved by discussion; initial discrepancy on
decisions of the studies finally included was low (1 study in 18
required any discussion).
Our searches identified 11,269 references. After deleting dupli-
cates and rapid screening for relevance (title only), 127 studies were
identified requiring further consideration. Further abstract screening
resulted in 57 studies kept for full text review. Following review, 40
papers were excluded due to: type of article (e.g. discussion, review)
(N = 7); not measuring associations with nurse staffing (N = 25); not
adult medical/surgical wards (N = 1); reporting medication errors
without discriminating errors due to delayed or omitted administra-
tion from those due to administering wrong drug or dosage (N = 7)
(see Figure 1).
2.5

Quality appraisal
To assess the risk of bias in studies, we adapted the NICE quality
appraisal checklist for quantitative studies reporting correlations and
associations (National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2012). Risk of
bias was expressed in terms of internal and external validity. Internal
validity included information on reliability and completeness of the
measurements and ability of the study to control for potential con-
founding factors. External validity was assessed primarily by consid-
ering representative sampling of centres for a large region/country
(e.g. random sample of hospital) and statistical power. The complete
appraisal checklist is available in Supporting Information. Assess-
ments were completed by one reviewer and corroborated indepen-
dently by a second reviewer.
2.6
|
Data abstraction
Data were abstracted on study design, setting, sample characteristics
(sample size of both staff and patients), staffing measures, preva-
lence of nursing tasks missed and measures of association/effect.
Where possible we extracted full details of the association including
point estimate, confidence interval and exact p value. Where report-
ing was incomplete, we included the detail provided by authors (e.g.
the author’s report that an association was statistically significant).
2.7

Synthesis
Assessment of missed care differed between instruments both in
terms of aspects of missed care assessed and wording of questions.
BERNCA assessed, “number of necessary nursing tasks for patients
withheld or otherwise not performed in the last seven working
days”, the MISSCARE survey asked, “frequency of care missed on
unit by all of the staff (including yourself)” while the RN4Cast/IHOC,
survey asked, “on your most recent shift, which of the following
activities [13-item list] were necessary but left undone because you
lacked the time to complete them?”. Details of the items are given in
Table 2. The QTDS asked patients to rate whether any of the six
elements of discharge information were needed but not received.
Because of the varying approaches to measuring missed care (i.e.
number of items in each instrument and reference to time period
when missed care occurred), to analyse the relative frequency of
missed care across studies, we rank-ordered the frequency with
which items of care were reported as missed. Where studies had
reported missed care using the same instrument we then calculated
1476 |
GRIFFITHS ET AL.
 the average rank of each item. Where items were rated on a scale,
we considered ratings of “always” or “often” to be “missed” care. To
avoid overweighting items from instruments used in only a single
study we only included results from instruments if they had been
used in multiple studies and/or studies with a large sample of hospi-
tals (10+) and nurses (1,000+). This meant that results would not be
unduly influenced by any studies that had been undertaken using a
unique instrument using only a small sample. We coded missed care
items as clinical, planning and communication or unclassified, based
on the factor analysis of the RN4Cast survey (Bruyneel et al., 2015).
Items were classified into one of the two factors where three of four
independent raters agreed on the classification. Because different
scales had different numbers of items, rankings were converted to
centiles to create a comparable metric so the most scored item
always scored 100 and the least scored item scored 0. Rankings
were compared using Kruskall–Wallis (non-parametric) Analysis of
variance (Minitab v 17.3).
For associations between staffing/skill mix, we adopted a narra-
tive approach to synthesis because of the diversity of settings, mea-
sures of staffing and missed care, and approaches to analysis
reported, which rendered statistical meta-analysis meaningless. Our
narrative synthesis was guided by a “vote counting” approach based
on significant results and weighted towards larger and higher quality
studies.

Included studies
In total, eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria for this review.
The external validity of seven studies was assessed as strong
(Ausserhofer et al., 2014; Ball et al., 2014; Ball et al., 2016; Bruyneel
et al., 2015; Griffiths, Dall’Ora, et al., 2014; Schubert et al., 2013;
Zander, Dobler, Baumler, & Busse, 2014), largely because of large
nationally representative samples of hospitals and nurses, all part of
the multinational RN4Cast study. All studies had at least moderate
risk of bias (internal validity). Table 1 presents a summary of the
included studies.
All the studies were cross-sectional. Sample sizes ranged from
232-31,627 nurses, most including only Registered Nurses (RNs)

 although some included healthcare support workers (HCSW) such as
nursing assistants or licensed vocational nurses in the nursing work-
force. Staffing levels were reported as patient:nurse ratio (12 stud-
ies), nursing hours per patient day (NHPPD or RNHPPD) (three
studies) or number of patients cared for in last shift (three studies).
Four studies explored aspects of skill mix (Ball et al., 2014; Ball
et al., 2016; Dabney & Kalisch, 2015; Palese et al., 2015). Seven
studies used data derived from the RN4Cast study, with four single
country analyses from England (Ball, et al., 2014), Germany (Zander
et al., 2014), Sweden (Ball, et al., 2016) and Switzerland (Schubert
et al., 2013) plus three multi-country analyses (Ausserhofer et al.,
2014;
Bruyneel,
et al.,
2015;
Griffiths,
Dall’Ora,
et
al.,
2014).
Although these papers report on separate aspects, there is consider-
able overlap and single country data are nested in the multi-country
analyses and so these seven studies are not fully independent.
In all studies missed care was assessed by a survey completed by
nurses or, for two studies, patients (Dabney & Kalisch, 2015; Weiss,
Yakusheva, & Bobay, 2011). Eight studies (Cho, Kim, Yeon, You, &
Lee, 2015; Dabney & Kalisch, 2015; Friese, Kalisch, & Lee, 2013;
Kalisch, Tschannen, & Lee, 2011; Kalisch, Tschannen, Lee, & Friese,
2011; Kalisch et al., 2013; Orique et al., 2015; Palese et al., 2015)
reported using a version of the MISSCARE survey (Kalisch & Wil-
liams, 2009); seven studies (Al-Kandari & Thomas, 2009; Ausser-
hofer, et al., 2014; Ball, et al., 2016; Ball, et al., 2014; Bruyneel,
et al., 2015; Griffiths, Dall’Ora, et al., 2014; Zander et al., 2014) used
a survey developed for the Registered Nurse Forecasting (RN4Cast)
study (Sermeus et al., 2011). One used the Basel Extent of Rationing
Nursing Care Assessment (BERNCA) revised (Schubert et al., 2007),
a version of the International Hospital Outcomes Survey (IHOS) (Al-
Kandari & Thomas, 2009) and one the Quality of Discharge Teaching
Scale (QTDS) content delivered sub-scale (Weiss et al., 2011). All
these measures cover a broad range of clinical and psychosocial
nursing care with the exception of the QTDS which focuses on con-
tent of discharge teaching. All these studies relied on recall and sub-
jective judgement of quantities and frequency of missed care. We
found no studies where objectively recorded aspects of missed care,
for example, records of completed assessments of vital signs, were
used.

Prevalence of missed care
An overall estimate of the frequency with which care was missed
could be made from seven studies (Al-Kandari & Thomas, 2009; Ball,
et al., 2016; Ball, et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2016; Griffiths, Ball, et al.,
2014; Griffiths, Dall’Ora, et al., 2014; Schubert, et al., 2013; Zander,

mates of the frequency with which some care was left undone on
the last shift ranged from 75% in England (Ball, et al., 2014) to 93%
in Germany (Zander, et al., 2014) with an overall estimate of 88%
across 12 European countries (Griffiths, Ball, et al., 2014; Griffiths,
Dall’Ora, et al., 2014). Using the same instrument, a rate of 81% was
reported from Korea (Cho et al., 2016). Fifty-five per cent of nurses
in Kuwait identified that they were unable to complete all required
procedures on their last shift (Al-Kandari & Thomas, 2009). Schubert
et al. reported that 98% of Swiss nurses had omitted at least one
item from the BERNCA survey in the last 7 days (Schubert, et al.,
2013).
Several studies explored specific aspects of missed care, with
each instrument addressing different aspects of care against differing
denominators and with different levels of specificity, making direct
comparison difficult. Table 2 presents a summary of the care missed
and the relative frequency (ranked average frequency) using the
three most widely used instruments. Care classified as “planning and
communication” (median rank 20th centile) was reported as missed
more often than clinical care (median rank 65th centile df = 2;
p = .001).
Using the BERNCA instrument (one study), emotional and psy-
chological support was reported as most often missed (rank 1/32
items). Forty-one per cent of nurses in Switzerland identified this as
a task that was sometimes or often “withheld” due to inadequate
staffing in the past 7 days (Schubert, et al., 2013). Comforting/talk-
ing to patients was the item most often reported as left undone on
the last shift in studies using the RN4CAST survey (rank 1/13 across
five studies). Frequency of reports ranged between 46% in England
(Ball, et al., 2016) and 82% in Germany (Zander, et al., 2014). Con-
versation (4/32 BERNCA) and education/counselling patients and
family
(2/13
RN4cast)
were
also
among
the
most
frequently
reported aspects of care missed in these studies. The most fre-
quently missed aspect of care reported on the MISSCARE survey
was patient ambulation (ranked 1/24). This was reported as always,
frequently or occasionally missed by between 76% of nurses in the
USA (Kalisch, Tschannen, Lee, Friese, 2011) and 91% of nurses in
Italy (Palese, et al., 2015). Other commonly missed elements of care
included assessment of newly admitted patients (2/32) and set up of
care plans (3/34) [BERNCA], mouth care (2/24) and attending inter-
disciplinary care conferences (3/24) [MISSCARE] and documenting
nursing care (3/13) [RN4CAST]. In general, where equivalent or simi-
lar items appeared on other instruments these items also ranked in
the top half of care most frequently missed.
While clinical care was less often reported as missed, the rates
of omission were still substantial. Monitoring of vital signs was one
of the least likely aspects to be reported as missed in studies using
MISSCARE (rank average 23/24), however, omissions of care in this
area were still relatively frequent, ranging between 16% (Palese,
et al., 2015) and 35% (Palese, et al., 2015). Studies using the
RN4CAST measure found up to 37% of nurses reporting some care
missed on the last shift (Zander, et al., 2014) while “patient monitor-
ing as prescribed by the physician” was reported as often/sometimes
missed by 17% of nurses using BERNCA (Schubert, et al., 2013).

Associations with staffing levels
Of the 18 studies, 14 found that lower nurse staffing levels were
significantly associated with higher levels of missed nursing care.
Two studies (Kalisch et al., 2013; Schubert, et al., 2013) showed no
significant effects (Table 1 for a summary of significant effects and

 direction of association) and two showed mixed effects. Across all
studies only two showed any association in the opposite direction—
in one case non-significant and in the other cases, results showed
associations in different directions for different aspects of missed
care.
In the RN4CAST study of 31,627 RNs from 488 hospitals in 12
European countries, the odds of nurses leaving care undone were
increased by 26% when nurses were caring for >11.5 patients, com-
pared with nurses caring for ≤6 patients (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.23–
1.29) (Griffiths, Ball, et al., 2014; Griffiths, Dall’Ora, et al., 2014).
Two further multi-country analyses from the same study using the
number of care items missed as the outcome confirmed this signifi-
cant association (Ausserhofer, et al., 2014; Bruyneel, et al., 2015). Of
the four single country analyses based on these data, statistically sig-
nificant associations between lower staffing and higher levels of
missed care were found in England (Ball, et al., 2014) and Sweden
(Ball, et al., 2016), but results from Germany (Zander, et al., 2014)
and Switzerland (Schubert, et al., 2013) were more equivocal. In Eng-
land, odds of missing care were 66% lower when RNs were caring
for 6.1 patients or fewer, compared with nurses caring for 11.7 or
more patients (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.22–0.53). In Sweden, shifts with
≤6 patients per RN were associated with a 53% reduction in the
odds of care left undone, compared with shifts on which there were
≥10 patients per RN (OR = 0.47, p < .001). In Germany, reports of
missing patient surveillance, skincare and medication given on time
were each increased by 3% for each additional patient per nurse
(OR = 1.03 p < .01) although for some aspects of care there were
smaller but significant associations in the opposite direction, suggest-
ing no overall relationship. However, in Switzerland the patient:nurse
ratio was significantly associated with missed care only when using
an unadjusted model. When analysis was adjusted for possible con-
founders, the association was no longer significant although there
was a significant association with nurse-perceived staffing adequacy.
Similar results were found in other countries. In South Korea, a
cross-sectional survey with 3,037 RNs, found that every one addi-
tional patient per RN was associated with a 3% increase in the odds
of care left undone using the RN4CAST measure (OR = 1.03;
p < .001) (Cho, et al., 2016), high staffed units (1:7, nurse:patient
ratio) were associated with less missed nursing care than low staffed
units (1:17, nurse:patient ratio) (b = 0.136; p = .02) (Cho et al.,
2015) and a study in 12 Italian hospital units, found that a lower
number of patients cared for by each RN was associated with less
missed care (OR = 0.91; p < .05) (Palese, et al., 2015). Weak nega-
tive correlations between completion of most nursing tasks and
staffing levels were observed in Kuwait, with the strongest correla-
tion (r = �.12) between the total workload and completion of teach-
ing patient/family (p < .005) (Al-Kandari & Thomas, 2009). All these
studies rated as moderate or high risk of bias.
In the USA, a study of 4,086 nursing staff in 10 hospitals found
that staff that cared for more patients reported more missed care
(b = 0.015; p < .001). (Kalisch, Tschannen, Lee, and Friese, 2011). A
second found that higher nursing hours per patient day were associ-
ated with lower level of missed care (b = �0.45; p = .002). (Kalisch,
Tschannen, Lee, 2011). These studies were rated as having moderate
risk of bias, but we could not ascertain if these were fully indepen-
dent studies. Smaller and lower quality studies provided a similar but
more mixed picture. A study in oncology units in nine hospitals
found a 1-patient increase in the number of patients cared for by
RNs and HCSW was associated with a 2.1% increase in the total
missed nursing care score (p < .05) (Friese et al., 2013), and a single
hospital study found a weak positive correlation between the num-
ber of patients per nurse and missed care (r = .246, p < .001).
(Palese, et al., 2015). However, a study in two hospitals in the USA
and Lebanon (Beirut) found the number of patients cared for was
not a significant predictor of missed care (Kalisch, Doumit, Lee, and
Zein, 2013).
Mixed results were found in studies using patient reports,
although these studies had a high or moderate risk of bias. A study
of 729 patients in two US hospitals found that patients’ reports of
not receiving timely care was weakly correlated with RN hours per
patient day (r = �.14, p = .002) (Dabney & Kalisch, 2015) but found
no correlation with overall patient reports of missed care. A study
focussing on discharge planning in four US hospitals found no signifi-
cant
association
between
non-overtime
RNHPPD
and
patient-
reported delivery of necessary discharge information (b = �0.05,
p = .74) (Weiss et al., 2011).

Skill mix and missed care
Four studies (Ball, et al., 2014; Ball, et al., 2016; Dabney & Kalisch,
2015; Palese, et al., 2015) explored associations between skill mix
and missed care either directly or indirectly. The results suggest that
adding support workers to the workforce does not generally reduce
the level of missed nursing care and may even increase it where skill
mix is diluted. Patient-reported timeliness of care was significantly
correlated with increased RN skill
mix in
one study (r = .13,
p < .001) (Dabney & Kalisch, 2015). Another study found that more
daily
care
provided
by
support
workers
was
associated
with
increased nurse-reported frequency of missed care (OR = 1.04; 95%
CI = 1.01–1.07) (Palese, et al., 2015), while two studies found that
higher numbers of support workers were not associated with reduc-
tions in the rate of care left undone except with very high levels of
support worker staffing in one study (<4 patients per support worker
OR = 0.71, p = .021) (Ball, et al., 2014; Ball, et al., 2016).

DISCUSSION
Our review found that the relationship between “missed care” and
nurse staffing levels in hospitals has been widely studied in many
countries. However, all of the research that we identified used sub-
jective measures of missed care, with most relying on retrospective
reports by nurses. Overall reported levels of missed care were high.
Aspects of planning and communication were more likely to be
reported as missed than clinical care, although reports of missing
essential clinical
procedures and
patient monitoring/observation
1484 |
GRIFFITHS ET AL.
 were still common. Almost all studies found that low nurse staffing
levels were related to higher reports of missed care. The findings
from most studies related to RN staffing levels. Evidence related to
the skill mix of the nursing team pointed to either no benefit or a
negative effect from higher levels of support workers although a sin-
gle study found that when HCSW staffing levels were very high
there was a reduced level of missed care.
Interest in missed care nursing has often been based on its role
as a potential mechanism explaining the association between patient
safety outcomes and nurse staffing levels. The hypothesis that low
staffing contributes to high mortality through missed opportunities
to identify and prevent deterioration is an important part of the
argument that these associations between staffing and outcomes are
causal (Clarke & Aiken, 2003; Griffiths, et al., 2016). The evidence in
this review does lend some support to this claim although the cur-
rent subjective measures, based on intermittent survey, do not read-
ily lend themselves to routine quality monitoring despite recent
interest in using missed care as a leading quality indicator.
The care most frequently reported as missed, such as talking to
and comforting patients, is of intrinsic importance to patients but it
is unlikely to directly explain how staffing levels influence adverse
outcomes such as mortality. The relative neglect of these aspects of
care may indeed reflect prioritisation of clinical care in the face of
staff shortages for sound clinical reasons although less positive moti-
vations, including deference to medicine, have also been suggested
(Papastavrou et al., 2014). Nonetheless, the levels of omission of
clinical care reported are still substantial. Broad measures of missed
care make no distinction between the relative importance of the
care that is missed. Not all missed care is of equal significance and
impact on patient outcomes will vary (Recio-Saucedo et al., 2017).
While there is some evidence that missed care mediates the rela-
tionship between staffing levels and measures of patient satisfaction
(Bruyneel, et al., 2015) and falls (Kalisch et al., 2012), direct evidence
of omitted clinical care mediating the relationship between staffing
and mortality is absent (Jones et al., 2015).
Furthermore, while the studies reviewed here generally support
the association between staffing levels and missed care, none tested
an association between staffing levels and any objective measure of
care. Although nurse reports of missed care are associated with
adverse patient outcomes (Recio-Saucedo, et al. 2017), it remains
unclear to what extent these reports correlate with actual omissions
of care. While studies that failed to show significant associations
were typically smaller and had a higher risk of bias, those which used
patient reports did not clearly confirm the results of studies which
used nurse reports. The differences in measures and approaches to
analyses used make comparison across studies difficult. Extrapolating
from the results of one of the studies with the most “dramatic”
appearing effect size, (Ball, et al., 2016) the reported 66% reduction
in the odds of reporting missed care in the best staffed wards com-
pared with the worst equates to a reduction from 89-75%. It seems
that although staffing levels may have an association with the rate
of reported missed care, most missed care cannot be attributed to
low staffing.

Limitations
While our review was based on an extensive search strategy it is
possible that we could have missed studies that focussed on omis-
sions of very specific aspects of care. However, this literature would
have to be extensive to change our broad conclusions. There may
have been publication bias in relation to staffing outcome associa-
tions. However, because the associations were supported by very
large studies, again unpublished evidence would have to be exten-
sive to substantially alter our results. While we have relied on the
conclusions from some studies where the reporting of results was
incomplete, our conclusions would only be changed if the reporting
of results by authors was systematically wrong in several studies.
Our conclusions are based exclusively on cross-sectional studies.
While the link to nursing work is direct, making a causal interpreta-
tion plausible, associations in these studies cannot establish causa-
tion. Our quality appraisal instrument was designed to assess relative
quality of cross-sectional studies following the methodology of NICE
(National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2012) and therefore
assigning a low risk of bias to a study does not assure a causal inter-
pretation.

CONCLUSION
While reported missed care is associated with nurse staffing levels
and such reports may indeed be indicators of inadequate nurse
staffing,
there
is
no
research
demonstrating
associations
with
objective measures of care. The extent to which the relationships
observed in these studies represent actual omissions of care and
the consequences of such failures, remains largely uninvestigated.
Given the potential consequences of missed care, its incidence/
prevalence may serve as an indicator of care quality and maintain-
ing adequate staffing levels is a mechanism to avoid missed care.
While the association between staffing and missed care is sub-
stantial it is unlikely that most care omissions are directly linked
to staffing levels only. Reports of missed care cannot in them-
selves be used to track nurse staffing adequacy, although changes
in the rate or frequency or reports could indicate nurse staffing
problems. Future research should focus on objective measures of
missed care on patient outcomes.
