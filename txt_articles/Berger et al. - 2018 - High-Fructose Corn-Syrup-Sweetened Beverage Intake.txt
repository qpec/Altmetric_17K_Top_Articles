Abstract: This study determined the effects of consuming a high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)-sweetened
beverage on breast milk fructose, glucose, and lactose concentrations in lactating women. At six
weeks postpartum, lactating mothers (n = 41) were randomized to a crossover study to consume
a commercially available HFCS-sweetened beverage or artificially sweetened control beverage.
At each session, mothers pumped a complete breast milk expression every hour for six consecutive
hours.
The baseline fasting concentrations of breast milk fructose, glucose, and lactose were
5.0 ± 1.3 µg/mL, 0.6 ± 0.3 mg/mL, and 6.8 ± 1.6 g/dL, respectively. The changes over time in breast
milk sugars were significant only for fructose (treatment × time, p < 0.01). Post hoc comparisons
showed the HFCS-sweetened beverage vs. control beverage increased breast milk fructose at 120 min
(8.8 ± 2.1 vs. 5.3 ± 1.9 µg/mL), 180 min (9.4 ± 1.9 vs. 5.2 ± 2.2 µg/mL), 240 min (7.8 ± 1.7 vs.
5.1 ± 1.9 µg/mL), and 300 min (6.9 ± 1.4 vs. 4.9 ± 1.9 µg/mL) (all p < 0.05). The mean incremental
area under the curve for breast milk fructose was also different between treatments (14.7 ± 1.2 vs.
−2.60 ± 1.2 µg/mL × 360 min, p < 0.01). There was no treatment × time interaction for breast milk
glucose or lactose. Our data suggest that the consumption of an HFCS-sweetened beverage increased
breast milk fructose concentrations, which remained elevated up to five hours post-consumption.

1. Introduction
Breastfeeding is the optimal source of infant nutrition [1–4], however, there is a significant
variation in breast milk both over time and between mothers because of a myriad of factors that affect
its composition [5–8]. These compositional differences may be related to the maternal diet during
lactation [7,8]. Because the current food environment affords the widespread availability of palatable,
energy-dense, and inexpensive foods [9,10], and because there is limited research on the consequences
of a “junk food” diet during lactation [11,12], there is a renewed interest in the effects of maternal
intake on the properties of breast milk [13]. The modification of breast milk composition by maternal
diet during lactation has the potential to impact infant growth and development [5,13,14].

Of particular interest to our group is the transmission of sugars from the mother’s diet to her
breast milk, which can then be transmitted to the infant. We are specifically concerned with the
effects of fructose. Early exposure to fructose has been shown to negatively affect appetite regulation,
increase risk for obesity, and may set the foundation for the development of metabolic disease [15,16].
Our recent study was the first to report that fructose is present in breast milk at concentrations ranging
from 4 to 8 µg/mL [13]. Despite these low concentrations, we showed that breast milk fructose was
positively associated with infant body weight and body composition at age six months [13]. To our
knowledge, no study has yet examined whether maternal intake of sugars during lactation alters the
sugar content of breast milk, which, if documented, would indicate an additional avenue by which
maternal intake affects infant nutritional status [17].
The primary aim of this randomized crossover study was to determine the acute effects of
consuming a sugar-sweetened beverage that contained high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS; a mixture of
free fructose and free glucose) on changes in breast milk fructose, glucose, and lactose concentrations
in lactating women over 360 min (six hours) after consumption. An artificially sweetened beverage,
which contained no caloric sugar, was used as a control. A secondary aim was to test moderation by
pre-pregnancy obesity status.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Subjects
Exclusively lactating women were enrolled at approximately six weeks postpartum. They were
included in the study if they were 18 to 45 years old, had a pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI)
< 25.0 kg/m2 or >29.9 kg/m2 based on medical chart abstraction, had a singleton birth, and had
a newborn ≥ 37 weeks gestational age. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) any tobacco use during
gestation; (2) alcohol consumption defined as >1 drink per week containing 14 grams of ethanol;
(3) diabetes; or (4) presumed or known congenital birth defects. All demographic information was
collected by medical chart abstraction when possible. The University of Oklahoma Institutional Review
Board approved all study procedures (clinicaltrials.gov registration #NCT02940795). Mothers provided
informed consent for their participation in the study before the initiation of data collection.
2.2. Study Design
Of the 59 women screened for eligibility, 18 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion
criteria (n = 13), refused to participate (n = 2), and could not pump sufficient breast milk to be able
to provide a sample at baseline (≥1 mL) (n = 3). In total, 41 mothers were randomized to the study.
Nineteen were classified as normal weight (BMI < 25.0 kg/m2) and 22 were classified as obese
(BMI > 29.9 kg/m2).
The enrolled participants were assigned sequentially to a computer-generated randomization
list by the principal investigator (D.A.F.) to receive either the HFCS-sweetened beverage (Coca-Cola:
Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, GA, USA) or a control beverage (Diet Rite Cola: Dr. Pepper Snapple
Group, Inc., Plano, TX, USA). Beverages were consumed on two separate days with a minimum of
three days apart. The study participants and study personnel were not blinded to treatment order.
Participants were provided with a hospital-grade breast pump (Symphony Breast Pump, Medela
Inc., McHenry, IL, USA) and labeled bottles. Breast milk collection was conducted in the participants’
homes. To help ensure compliance with the protocol, participants visited the laboratory and received
in-person instructions from trained study personnel. On the day prior to testing, participants were
instructed to refrain from eating any candy, cookies, “junk food,” fruit, fruit juice, and soft drinks.
After an overnight fast, participants pumped one complete breast milk expression as the baseline
sample starting at 6:00 am. The HFCS-sweetened beverage (20 fluid ounces or 592 mL) contained
240 calories, 0 grams total fat, 75 mg sodium, 65 grams total carbohydrate (65 grams of sugar as
HFCS-55), and 0 grams protein. The control beverage (12 fluid ounces or 355 mL) was artificially
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 669
3 of 9
sweetened with acesulfame potassium and had no calories, total fat, sodium, total carbohydrate,
and protein. The HFCS-sweetened beverage and the control beverage were consumed with a standard
meal (Jimmy Dean Delights Turkey Sausage Breakfast Bowl: Tyson Foods, Inc., Springdale, AR, USA)
provided by the study team. Participants were instructed to finish the contents of the beverage and
meal within a 20-minute time frame.
Upon consuming the beverage and the contents of the standard meal, participants pumped one
complete breast milk expression every hour for 6 consecutive hours. Per testing protocol, participants
were instructed to immediately freeze each sample in accordance with proper handling procedures [18].
While participants were encouraged to pump from the right breast to standardize the testing protocol,
they were allowed to use their discretion regarding which breast to pump from. Trained study
personnel arranged to pick up frozen samples within two days of collection. The breast milk samples
were placed on ice to take back to the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Oklahoma City campus,
where they were immediately frozen until batch analysis.
2.3. Breast Milk Analysis
2.3.1. Preparation of Fructose Quantification Sample
The protein was removed by precipitating from the breast milk (50 µL) with addition of 200 µL of
acetonitrile containing 10 µg of carbon-13 labeled (13C6)-fructose as the internal standard for natural
fructose quantification in the breast milk. The supernatant, which contained natural fructose as well
as 13C6-fructose, was collected after centrifugation of the protein precipitated breast milk for mass
spectrometry analysis. The 5-point calibration samples were prepared for the absolute quantification
of fructose in the breast milk. Quality control (QC) samples were also prepared by pooling some of the
individual supernatants for the monitoring of analytical performance throughout the fructose analysis.
2.3.2. Preparation of Glucose Quantification Sample
The serum protein was removed by precipitating from the breast milk (50 µL) with addition of
200 µL of acetonitrile containing 20 µg of deuterium labeled (D2)-glucose as the internal standard for
natural glucose quantification in the breast milk. The supernatant, which contained natural glucose as
well as glucose- D2, was collected after centrifugation of the protein precipitated breast milk for MS
analysis. The 4- or 5-point calibration samples were prepared for the absolute quantification (mg/mL)
of glucose in the breast milk. QC samples were also prepared by pooling some of the individual
supernatants for the monitoring of analytical performance throughout the glucose analysis.
2.3.3. Preparation of Lactose Quantification Sample
The original breast milk was initially diluted 100-fold with water. Then, 5 µL of the diluted breast
milk was again diluted by 200-fold with 995 µL of water containing 5 µg of 13C12-lactulose as the
internal standard. The 4-point calibration samples were prepared for the absolute quantification of
lactose in the breast milk. QC samples were prepared for lactose analysis.
2.3.4. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis
The fructose, glucose, and lactose analyses were performed with a Shimadzu 20AD HPLC system
and a Leap PAL autosampler coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API-4000: Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) operated in MRM mode, as described by Goran et al. [13].
2.4. Statistical Analyses
2.4.1. Sample Size Calculation
Power calculations were computed based on the primary outcome breast milk fructose, glucose,
and lactose. Assumptions are required concerning the difference in mean changes in the response

4 of 9
(i.e., differences in the mean breast milk fructose, glucose, and lactose values) across treatment groups,
and the variance of the gain score, from which effect size can be computed. Using data previously
collected in our laboratory [13], we pooled estimates of the standard deviation (SD) of change for breast
milk fructose (SD = 0.2 µg/mL), glucose (SD = 0.1 mg/mL), and lactose (SD = 0.2 mg/mL), and we
estimated effect sizes (i.e., Cohen’s d) for these outcomes (fructose, d = 0.57; glucose, d = 0.48; and
lactose, d = 0.76) based on the assumption that the HFCS-sweetened beverage would elicit at least a 10%
mean change difference relative to the control beverage. We determined that 18 to 37 subjects/group
would provide 80 to 85% power (α = 0.05) to detect a difference in the mean change of the outcome
variable between treatments. With a given sample size of 37 subjects/group (α level set at 0.05),
the proposed study had a power of 0.80. Assuming a 10% sample size loss due to either attrition or the
insufficient quality of measurements, a starting sample size of 41 subjects per treatments preserved the
power of the study design.
2.4.2. Analyses
Group differences in the baseline characteristics between normal weight and obese participants
were determined by unpaired t-tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables.
Differences in the concentrations of breast milk fructose, glucose, and lactose by treatment over
the 6-hour testing period were determined using a 2-factor repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with the main effects of treatment and time and treatment × time interaction with repeated
measures for the participants after the HFCS-sweetened beverage and control beverage challenges,
respectively. If the treatment × time interaction was significant at p < 0.05, multiple comparisons at
each time point were performed using the Bonferroni method. Covariance structures were compared
using the Akaike information criterion; the autoregressive structure and the compound symmetry
structure had similar Akaike information criterion values, so the compound symmetry structure was
chosen. To test moderation by pre-pregnancy obesity status, a 3-factor repeated measures ANOVA was
performed for each outcome measure in separate models. In addition, calculations for the incremental
area under the curve (iAUC) were performed for breast milk fructose, glucose, and lactose using the
trapezoidal method. To assess differences in iAUC for breast milk fructose, glucose, and lactose in
response to the beverages, independent sample t tests were conducted. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS software (version 22.0, 2013: IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA). A p-value
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all analyses.
3. Results
The flow diagram of the participants is presented in Figure 1. Of the 59 women screened for
eligibility, 69% (41 women) met the inclusion criteria. The baseline characteristics of the participants
by pre-pregnancy obesity status are presented in Table 1. By design, the normal weight group had
a lower BMI compared to the obese group (23.1 ± 1.7 kg/m2 vs. 33.7 ± 4.2 kg/m2, p < 0.01). However,
the fasting baseline concentrations of breast milk fructose, glucose, and lactose did not differ between
pre-pregnancy obesity status groups.

Figure 2a shows the breast milk fructose response to each beverage.
The fasting baseline
fructose concentration was 5.0 ± 1.3 µg/mL. There was a significant increase in the baseline
concentrations of breast milk fructose in response to the HFCS-sweetened beverage, but not the
control beverage (treatment × time interaction, p < 0.01). For the HFCS-sweetened beverage arm,
the time to peak breast milk fructose was 180 min (three hours) and the peak concentration was
9.4 ± 1.9 µg/mL. Concentrations remained significantly higher than the baseline up to 300 min
(five hours) after consumption (p < 0.01). The mean iAUC was also significantly higher in response to
the HFCS-sweetened beverage than the control beverage (14.7 ± 1.2 vs. −2.60 ± 1.2 µg/mL × 360 min,
p < 0.01). There was no moderation by pre-pregnancy obesity status.

0.6 ± 0.3 mg/mL. There was no change in the baseline concentrations of breast milk glucose in response
to the HFCS-sweetened beverage compared to the control beverage (treatment × time interaction,
p = 0.19), and there were no differences in mean iAUC between groups (p = 0.18). Figure 2c reveals
the findings for breast milk lactose. The fasting baseline lactose concentration was 6.8 ± 1.6 g/dL.
There was no treatment × time interaction for concentrations of breast milk lactose (p = 0.28), and there
were no differences in the mean iAUC between groups (p = 0.91). In addition, there was no moderation
by pre-pregnancy obesity status for glucose or lactose responses.

4. Discussion
This is the first study that we are aware of a report that consuming an HFCS-sweetened
beverage during lactation leads to an increase in fructose concentrations, but not glucose or lactose
concentrations, in breast milk. Studies to date have found that variability in maternal diet and weight
status both contribute to heterogeneity in breast milk composition [7,8,19]. Our objective was to test
whether the consumption of an HFCS-sweetened beverage had any impact on breast milk sugar
composition. In a group of 41 lactating women, we found that consuming 20 fluid ounces (592 mL) of
an HFCS-sweetened beverage (65 grams of sugar as HFCS-55) compared to an artificially sweetened
beverage (zero grams of sugar) doubled the concentration of fructose in breast milk within three
hours, regardless of pre-pregnancy BMI, and remained elevated for five hours. Though the fructose
concentrations were much lower than those of glucose and lactose, our work to date suggests that this
may still be biologically relevant for infants and warrants further investigation [13,20].
Our findings confirmed those of our previous work on a separate cohort of women, that fructose
is detectable in breast milk and was apparent at a “basal” concentration of approximately 5 µg/mL [13].
To build on this, we provide new evidence in the current study that fructose in breast milk can be
derived from fructose in the maternal diet. When normal weight and obese mothers consumed 20 fluid
ounces (592 mL) of an HFCS-sweetened beverage, which may contain 36 to 40 grams of fructose,
depending on the HFCS formulation [21], the concentration of breast milk fructose increased by 92%
within three hours relative to the control beverage. Concentrations were still significantly higher than
baseline for five hours after consumption. This suggests the potential for the elevation of fructose if
mothers regularly consume HFCS-sweetened products in the hours before and during breastfeeding.
Because infants tend to feed every two to three hours in the first month, they could be well within the
window for multiple exposures to fructose.
During the HFCS-sweetened beverage challenge, concentrations of breast milk fructose peaked
at 9.4 µg/mL. We recognize that this amount of fructose is quite low and may not even exert any
biological effects on infants due to the underdeveloped fructose transporter, GLUT5 [22]. On the other
hand, there is evidence to suggest that it might be clinically relevant during this critical window of
development. For example, data have shown that a dose similar to our peak fructose concentration
(i.e., 10 µg/mL) primed pre-adipocyte precursor cells for fat tissue growth [23]. Moreover, we recently
reported that a mean of 7 µg/mL of breast milk fructose was associated with greater infant body
weight and body composition (fat mass, lean mass, and bone mass) at age six months [13]. Because
fructose from the maternal diet is metabolized by the liver, repackaged into triglycerides, and may
be released into circulation [24,25], one potential hypothesis is that triglycerides spill over into breast
milk and affect infant growth [26,27]. However, more work is needed to examine how fructose is
metabolized in lactating women and the potential mechanisms that may underlie our findings.
In contrast, there was no significant effect of either beverage on the concentrations of glucose or
lactose in breast milk. This is in agreement with findings from other studies, namely that changes in
maternal diet are thought to elicit no changes in the principal sugars in breast milk [7,8]. The differential
effects of an HFCS-sweetened beverage on the concentrations of breast milk fructose vs. glucose could
be attributed to the distinct ways in which they are used in the body. While fructose is metabolized
exclusively in the liver and is not well regulated [28], glucose is metabolized in all organs and is
tightly controlled by insulin. Insulin may regulate blood glucose concentrations before there is an
opportunity for them to enter the mammary epithelial cells via a passive, facilitated process driven by
the downward glucose concentration gradient [29–31]. Circulating fructose concentrations, however,
are not subject to the same regulated process to enter breast milk [31,32]. Accordingly, the amount of
breast milk fructose would be directly related to the amount of fructose consumed in the diet.
This study is not without limitations. First, the sample was relatively small and racially and
demographically homogenous, which limits the generalizability of our findings. Another potential
limitation was that breast milk collection was conducted in the participants’ homes, and information
regarding the adherence to study protocol (e.g., refraining from sugar-laden products) was not obtained.

We did not have dietary information to describe the habitual consumption of sugar. It is also important
to note that we did not assess biochemical parameters indicative of metabolic abnormalities in breast
milk (i.e., insulin) or blood (i.e., glucose). Lastly, our study was not statistically powered to detect
a moderation effect by pre-pregnancy obesity status. It would be worthwhile to explore this further in
appropriately powered trials due to the metabolic implications of obesity [30].
5. Conclusions
Overall, the findings from this study revealed that mothers’ consumption of an HFCS-sweetened
beverage significantly increased concentrations of breast milk fructose, which persisted for five hours,
with no effect on breast milk glucose or lactose. The consequences of the habitual elevation of breast
milk fructose for infants require further investigation [13,15,20]. This should be explored with a larger
sample size that collects additional data on maternal diet as well as metabolic outcomes to better
understand the potential implications of foods and beverages sweetened with fructose-containing
sugars in early life.
