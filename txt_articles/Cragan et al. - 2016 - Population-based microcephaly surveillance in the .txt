Abstract
Background—Congenital microcephaly has been linked to maternal Zika virus infection. 
However, ascertaining infants diagnosed with microcephaly can be challenging.
Methods—Thirty birth defects surveillance programs provided data on infants diagnosed with 
microcephaly born 2009 to 2013. The pooled prevalence of microcephaly per 10,000 live births 
was estimated overall and by maternal/infant characteristics. Variation in prevalence was examined 
across case finding methods. Nine programs provided data on head circumference and conditions 
potentially contributing to microcephaly.
Results—The pooled prevalence of microcephaly was 8.7 per 10,000 live births. Median 
prevalence (per 10,000 live births) was similar among programs using active (6.7) and passive 
(6.6) methods; the interdecile range of prevalence estimates was wider among programs using 
passive methods for all race/ethnicity categories except Hispanic. Prevalence (per 10,000 live 
births) was lowest among non-Hispanic Whites (6.5) and highest among non-Hispanic Blacks and 
Hispanics (11.2 and 11.9, respectively); estimates followed a U-shaped distribution by maternal 
age with the highest prevalence among mothers <20 years (11.5) and ≥40 years (13.2). For 
gestational age and birth weight, the highest prevalence was among infants <32 weeks gestation 
and infants <1500 gm. Case definitions varied; 41.8% of cases had an HC ≥ the 10th percentile for 
sex and gestational age.
Conclusion—Differences in methods, population distribution of maternal/infant characteristics, 
and case definitions for microcephaly can contribute to the wide range of observed prevalence 
estimates across individual birth defects surveillance programs. Addressing these factors in the 
setting of Zika virus infection can improve the quality of prevalence estimates.

Introduction
Since the first reports of an increased number of infants born with microcephaly in Brazil in 
September 2015, great strides have been made in characterizing the causal relationship 
between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and congenital microcephaly, as well as other 
serious brain abnormalities (Rasmussen et al., 2016; Schuler-Faccini et al., 2016). This work 
emphasized the value of comprehensive population-based surveillance data on these defects. 
The National Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN) was established in 1997 with the 
mission of improving population-based surveillance of birth defects in the United States 
(http://www.nbdpn.org). Since 2000, the NBDPN has released annual reports containing 
state-specific, population-based data on the prevalence of major birth defects; however,

 ascertaining infants with microcephaly can present challenges for birth defects surveillance 
programs.
To illustrate, the prevalence of microcephaly for the years 2006 to 2010 estimated by 
surveillance programs included in the NBDPN Annual Report 2013 ranged from 0.5 to 19.0 
per 10,000 live births (Mai et al., 2013). Differences in the clinical definition of 
microcephaly, the timing and setting of diagnosis, case ascertainment methods, and other 
factors may have contributed to this wide variation in observed prevalence. For these 
reasons, microcephaly was dropped from the list of defects requested in the NBDPN Annual 
Report in 2014 (Mai et al., 2014), but many programs have continued to monitor its 
prevalence.
The purpose of this report is to describe the estimated prevalence of microcephaly in the 
United States from 2009 to 2013 using data from thirty population-based birth defects 
surveillance programs and to explore potential reasons for some of the observed variation in 
prevalence.
BACKGROUND ON MICROCEPHALY
Microcephaly is the clinical finding of a small head when compared with infants of the same 
sex and age, or gestational age if measured at birth. The head circumference (HC), also 
known as the occipitofrontal circumference, is used to assess the volume of the underlying 
brain (Bray et al., 1969; Cooke et al., 1977). Measurements of HC are compared with 
standard references and described in terms of percentiles or SDs above or below the mean 
for the reference population. Clinicians can differ in the reference value they use as the 
threshold for defining microcephaly or as a trigger for evaluation of an infant for an 
underlying abnormality. Commonly used thresholds are less than 3rd percentile or more than 
2 SD below the mean. Other thresholds used are less than the 5th or 10th percentiles, or more 
than 3 SDs below the mean (Opitz and Holt, 1990; Raymond and Holmes, 1994; Ashwal et 
al., 2009). Complicating classification further is that measurement of HC in the newborn or 
young infant can be inaccurate due to molding of the head following vaginal birth, infant 
movement, use of tapes that measure only to the nearest half centimeter, and other factors. It 
is critical to assess head growth, and thus growth of the brain, routinely throughout 
childhood (Holden, 2014). Microcephaly is confirmed when repeated HC measurements 
over time remain smaller than expected, or become progressively smaller, compared with 
infants of the same sex and age.
While the finding of a small HC may suggest an abnormality in the underlying brain, it does 
not confirm an abnormality or define its nature. Some infants who are constitutionally small 
overall will have an HC below a given threshold without any underlying brain abnormality. 
Others may have a small HC due to limitations on growth in utero that are unrelated to brain 
structure or function. Microcephaly is disproportionate when the HC is small in proportion 
to infant length and weight, which may be normal for sex and age; or proportionate when the 
HC, length, and weight are all small for the infant’s sex and age, but proportional to each 
other (Leviton et al., 2002). In congenital microcephaly, the decreased HC is present 
prenatally or at the time of delivery. However, microcephaly can be acquired postnatally due 
to a delivery complication or a subsequent insult, such as infection or trauma (Baxter et al., 
Cragan et al.

 2009; von der Hagen et al., 2014). In addition, microcephaly that is due to a genetic 
syndrome may not be present at birth but develop postnatally.
Although most cases of congenital microcephaly have unknown etiology, some causes of 
congenital microcephaly have been identified (Ashwal et al., 2009). Microcephaly is a 
known component of some chromosomal abnormalities and single gene disorders (Opitz and 
Holt, 1990). It is a component of fetal alcohol syndrome and a manifestation of several 
congenital infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and rubella). Congenital 
microcephaly has been associated with other exposures or conditions including placental 
insufficiency in utero, poorly controlled maternal diabetes, high levels of radiation exposure, 
and in utero exposure to the medication hydantoin. The clinical implications, natural history, 
and developmental potential for infants with microcephaly vary depending on the cause and 
severity.
Taken together, variations in how microcephaly is defined, the existence of different types, 
the timing of diagnosis, and the accuracy of gestational age estimates at birth can contribute 
to variation in the reported prevalence of microcephaly. Microcephaly surveillance is 
particularly challenging when programs use different methods in terms of the settings where 
cases are identified (e.g., birth hospitals only, birth and pediatric hospitals, out-patient 
specialty clinics) and the maximum age at which affected children are ascertained (e.g., 
newborn only, up to 1 year, up to 3 years). For many programs, limitations on types of data 
sources and time period for case ascertainment and follow-up are critical. However, the 
recent increased focus on microcephaly as a consequence of congenital Zika virus infection 
has led to heightened interest in re-examining the epidemiologic characteristics of 
microcephaly and improving case ascertainment of this condition.
Materials and Methods
The NBDPN issued a call to state and territorial birth defects surveillance programs for data 
on infants born from 2009 to 2013 who have a diagnosis of microcephaly (see 
Supplementary Materials, which are avaiable online). A total of thirty programs provided 
data. Typically, cases were identified by the presence of an ICD-9-CM hospital discharge 
code for microcephaly or mention of microcephaly in the medical record regardless of the 
HC size. One program was known to have required that the HC measurement be less than 
the 3rd percentile by sex and gestational age for inclusion in the surveillance. Data provided 
for each case included the year of birth, maternal race/ethnicity and age at delivery, infant 
sex, gestational age, birth weight, and plurality. Eight programs also provided information 
on the specific HC measurement or value of the HC percentile for each case; a ninth 
provided the number of cases within categories of HC percentiles. These nine programs also 
included data on the infant’s age at the time of the first HC measurement ascertained by the 
surveillance program, whether the certainty of the microcephaly diagnosis was considered 
confirmed (definite) or questionable (possible/probable), and the presence of additional 
conditions that might contribute to microcephaly.
Participating programs were divided into those with active case finding methods and those 
with passive case finding methods. Generally, in active case finding, children with birth

 defects are identified through review and abstraction of medical records at data sources, 
which may include birth and pediatric hospitals, prenatal diagnostic offices, subspecialty 
offices and other sources; in passive case finding, children with birth defects are identified 
and reported to the program from administrative datasets at the sources. Some passive 
programs verify reported diagnoses through subsequent medical record review. Maternal 
race/ethnicity was categorized as: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-
Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native, 
other, and unknown. Infants identified as being of more than one race were bridged to a 
single race category using data from the National Center for Health Statistics, when 
available.
When these bridged data were not available, infants of more than one race were assigned to 
the category of other and unknown race. Maternal age at delivery was categorized as less 
than 20 years, 20 to 24 years, 25 to 29 years, 30 to 34 years, 35 to 39 years, 40 or more 
years, and unknown. Gestational age was categorized as term (37 weeks or greater), preterm 
(32–36 weeks), very preterm (less than 32 weeks), and unknown. Birth weight was 
categorized as normal (2500 gm or more), low (1500–2499 gm), very low (less than 1500 
gm), and unknown. Plurality was categorized as singleton, twin, triplet or higher multiple, 
and unknown.
The percentile for each newborn HC value from the eight programs that provided these data 
was calculated using the INTERGROWTH-21st international standards for newborn weight, 
length, and head circumference by gestational age and sex (available at: https://
intergrowth21.tghn.org/articles/international-standards-newborn-weight-length-and-head-
circumference-gestational-age-and-sex-newborn-cross-sectional-study-inte/). The 
INTERGROWTH-21st standards include reference values for term, preterm, and very 
preterm newborns. The percentile for each HC value taken beyond the birth hospitalization 
from the programs that provided these data was calculated using the World Health 
Organization Child Growth Standards (available at: http://www.who.int/childgrowth/
standards/hc_for_age/en/). For those cases where HC measurements were not available (less 
than 1% of cases), the percentile values provided by the state programs were used. 
Percentiles for HC were categorized as less than 3rd percentile, 3rd to less than 5th percentile, 
5th to less than 10th percentile, and greater or equal to 10th percentile. Percentiles for HC 
were not calculated for infants less than 24 weeks gestation or greater than 42 weeks 
gestation because reference standards for these infants were not available through 
INTERGROWTH-21.
Additional conditions that might contribute to microcephaly included other birth defects 
(neural tube defects, holoprosencephaly, craniosynostosis, and conjoined twins), 
chromosomal abnormalities and/or clinical syndromes (including fetal alcohol syndrome), 
and non-Zika in utero infections. All chromosomal abnormalities, clinical syndromes, and in 
utero infections were included as possibly contributing regardless of whether they were 
known to be associated with microcephaly. Cases with more than one additional contributing 
condition were included in each category for which they had a condition.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data were pooled across thirty programs and the unadjusted prevalence of microcephaly was 
estimated as the number of reported cases divided by the total live birth population from the 
corresponding time period overall and by maternal and infant characteristics (Mason et al., 
2005). The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around all prevalence estimates were calculated 
using the Clopper-Pearson method (Clopper and Pearson, 1934). Prevalence estimates for 
microcephaly by plurality and gestational age categories (estimates by gestational age 
category were restricted to singleton infants only) were also stratified by maternal race/
ethnicity. To assess variability in the prevalence of microcephaly across programs, the mean, 
median, interquartile (25th to 75th percentile) and interdecile (10th to 90th percentile) ranges 
were calculated overall, by case finding methodology (active, passive), and by race/ethnicity. 
A similar analysis was performed for HC percentiles with the mean, median, interquartile 
and interdecile ranges calculated by gestational age category.
Results
In Table 1, the counts, unadjusted prevalence estimates, and 95% CIs for microcephaly are 
presented using pooled data for 2009 to 2013 from all 30 participating birth defects 
surveillance programs. The total surveillance population covered over 11 million live births 
during this time period. The pooled unadjusted prevalence for microcephaly was 8.7 per 
10,000 live births (95% CI, 8.5–8.9), or approximately 1 in 1150 births.
MATERNAL AND INFANT CHARACTERISTICS
Prevalence estimates for microcephaly (per 10,000 live births) were lowest among non-
Hispanic Whites (6.5) and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islanders (7.6), and highest among 
non-Hispanic Blacks (11.2) and Hispanics (11.9). Prevalence estimates (per 10,000 live 
births) by maternal age followed a U-shaped pattern with the highest estimates observed in 
the youngest (less than 20 years) and oldest (40 years or greater) age categories (11.5 and 
13.2, respectively). This U-shaped pattern was generally consistent across all race/ethnicity 
groups (data not shown).
The estimated prevalence of microcephaly increased with decreasing gestational age and 
with decreasing birth weight. For gestational age, the estimated prevalence (per 10,000 live 
births) was highest among very preterm births at less than 32 weeks gestation (58.0) and 
lowest among term births at 37 weeks or more gestation (6.2). For birth weight, the 
estimated prevalence (per 10,000 live births) was highest among infants with very low birth 
weight of less than 1500 gm (74.1) and lowest among infants with normal birth weight of 
2500 gm or greater (5.0). The estimated prevalence of microcephaly (per 10,000 live births) 
also was higher among twins (12.0) and triplets or higher multiples (17.3) compared with 
that for singletons (8.5).
Because race/ethnicity can be associated with the distribution of preterm and multiple births 
in a population, microcephaly prevalence estimates for these characteristics were stratified 
by maternal race/ethnicity (Table 2). Prevalence estimates of microcephaly increased with 
decreasing gestational age among singleton births within every maternal race/ethnicity

 category, although the CIs were particularly wide for non-Hispanic American Indians and 
Alaska Natives due to the small number of affected infants. Similarly, prevalence estimates 
for twins and triplets or higher multiples were generally greater compared with singletons 
across maternal racial/ethnic categories.
CASE FINDING METHODOLOGY
In Table 3, the mean with standard deviation, median (P50), interquartile interval range 
(P25–P75) and interdecile range (P10–P90) for the prevalence estimates of microcephaly are 
presented for birth defects surveillance programs by type of case finding methodology 
(active, passive) stratified by maternal race/ethnicity. In this analysis, each program carried 
an equal weight regardless of population size. The accompanying figure displays the mean 
(circle), median (middle vertical bar), interquartile range (outer vertical bars), and interdecile 
interval (horizontal lines). The vertical width of each box represents the percent of total 
cases contributed by each race/ethnicity group. Non-Hispanic Whites are shown in green, 
non-Hispanic Blacks in pink, Hispanics in blue, and total for all race/ethnicities in white. 
Race/ethnicity categories that provided less than 10% of the total cases are not shown. A 
visual explanation of a similar figure was presented in the 2015 NBDPN Annual Report 
(Mai et al., 2015).
Among programs with active case finding, the mean estimated prevalence of microcephaly 
(per 10,000 live births) was 7.3 and the median was 6.7, with 80% of programs reporting a 
prevalence between 3.4 and 12.1 (Table 3). Among programs with passive case finding, the 
mean estimated prevalence of microcephaly (per 10,000 live births) was 7.7 and the median 
was 6.6, with 80% of programs reporting a prevalence between 1.9 and 18.7. The variability 
in prevalence estimates, as indicated by the width of the interdecile range, was greater for 
birth defects surveillance programs with passive compared with active case finding for all 
race/ethnicity categories except Hispanic ethnicity. Programs that used active case finding 
methods reported the highest mean prevalence (per 10,000 live births) among Hispanics 
(9.9). Hispanics also accounted for the largest proportion of total cases among programs 
with active case finding. The next highest mean prevalence (per 10,000 live births) among 
programs with active case finding was for non-Hispanic Blacks (8.6) followed by non-
Hispanic Whites (5.6).
Programs that used passive case finding methods reported the highest mean prevalence (per 
10,000 live births) among non-Hispanic Blacks (11.5), followed by Hispanics (7.1) and non-
Hispanic Whites (6.2). Non-Hispanic Whites accounted for the largest proportion of total 
cases among these programs. The median estimated prevalence of microcephaly among 
programs with active and those with passive case finding were similar for all race/ethnicity 
categories except non-Hispanic Black. Non-Hispanic Black was also the race/ethnicity 
category that contributed the lowest proportion of cases regardless of case finding 
methodology. For both types of programs, the median prevalence estimates were lower than 
the mean estimates, presumably because the median value is less influenced by outliers and 
less subject to skewing by data from programs with very high prevalence estimates.

 ADDITIONAL DATA ON MICROCEPHALY DIAGNOSES
Additional data on microcephaly diagnoses provided by nine birth defects surveillance 
programs are presented in Table 4. Six of the nine programs provided information on the 
certainty of the microcephaly diagnosis. Almost 95% of the cases reported by these six 
programs were considered to have a definite microcephaly diagnosis; 5.3% (205/3851) were 
considered to have a possible/probable diagnosis. Seven programs were able to provide data 
on additional conditions that might contribute to microcephaly. Almost 30% of cases from 
these programs had at least one additional contributing condition; 22.9% had a chromosomal 
abnormality or syndrome, 2.2% had documentation of a non-Zika in utero infection, and 
6.7% had other birth defects (neural tube defects, holoprosencephaly, craniosynostosis, or 
conjoined twins).
One of the nine programs was dropped from the analysis of HC percentiles because their 
case definition required that cases have an HC less than the 3rd percentile for gestational age 
and sex to be included in the surveillance. Among the remaining eight programs, 27.8% of 
cases had a HC measurement less than 3rd percentile; 41.8% had a HC measurement greater 
than or equal to the 10th percentile. Head circumference percentiles could not be calculated 
for 14.7% of cases from these eight programs due to missing HC measurements, sex, or 
gestational age values, or because the infants were less than 24 weeks or greater than 42 
weeks gestation at birth. Slightly more than 98% of the HC measurements provided were 
taken during the birth hospitalization.
Analysis of the variability of HC percentiles by gestational age category is presented for 
seven programs in Table 5. The figure accompanying Table 5 displays the mean (circle), 
median (middle vertical bar), interquartile range (outer vertical bars), and interdecile range 
(horizontal lines) for HC percentiles. The one program that provided only the number of 
cases within each HC percentile category was dropped from this analysis. In general, the 
mean HC percentile increased with decreasing gestational age (22.2 among term births, 23.4 
among preterm births and 37.6 among very pretem births). The median HC percentile was 
the same for term and preterm births (8.7) but much higher for very preterm births (29.0). 
While the interdecile ranges were similar for all three groups, the interquartile range for very 
preterm births was much wider (7.4–65.2) than for term or preterm births (1.4–34.5 and 1.6–
36.1, respectively).
Discussion
The pooled estimated prevalence of microcephaly from 2009 to 2013 among 30 population-
based birth defects surveillance programs in the United States was 8.7 per 10,000 live births 
(95% CI, 8.5–8.9). Worldwide, the reported prevalence of microcephaly varies widely. The 
European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) reported an overall prevalence 
of microcephaly of 2.85 per 10,000 live births (95% CI, 2.69–3.02) among full member 
registries for birth years 2008 to 2012 (http://www.eurocat-network.eu/
ACCESSPREVALENCEDATA/PrevalenceTables). Among population-based programs 
included in the 2014 annual report of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects, the 
prevalence estimates for microcephaly for the most recent available birth year (2011, 2012, 
Cragan et al.

 or 2013) varied widely from 0.42 to 21.24 per 10,000 live births (http://www.icbdsr.org/
filebank/documents/ar2005/Report2014.pdf).
The data in this report demonstrate several factors that could contribute to the observed 
variation in the prevalence of microcephaly across U.S. birth defects surveillance programs. 
While there was little difference in the median prevalence estimates of microcephaly among 
programs with active versus passive surveillance methods, the estimates among programs 
with active case finding generally showed less variability. This may be due to a combination 
of more rigorous case finding and confirmation of suspected cases. A higher estimated 
prevalence of defects other than microcephaly by programs with active compared with 
passive case finding has been demonstrated, presumably reflecting more complete case 
ascertainment (Parker et al., 2010; Mai et al., 2015).
In this issue of the journal, investigators with the Utah Birth Defect Network (UBDN) 
evaluated their ascertainment of microcephaly (Steele et al., 2016). Their results 
demonstrated the variability of ascertainment depending on the source and method of case 
finding. The UBDN uses a combination of active and passive case finding methods. They 
found that 53% of all potential cases of microcephaly reported to the UBDN were 
subsequently confirmed as true cases. The sources of case ascertainment with the highest 
positive predictive value for confirmed microcephaly included tertiary neonatal intensive 
care units and pediatric specialty clinics including genetics and ophthalmology. 
Approximately 50% of reports from vital records and hospital discharge data were 
subsequently confirmed to have microcephaly. Cases reported by multiple sources were 
more likely to be true cases of microcephaly.
The distribution of HC percentiles among birth defects surveillance programs that were able 
to submit these data demonstrates wide variation in the clinical definition of microcephaly. 
Almost 42% of the cases had an HC greater than or equal to the 10th percentile for age and 
sex. Such differences in the definition of microcephaly may account for much of the 
variation in prevalence estimates across surveillance programs, and is one reason that 
surveillance for microcephaly is considered particularly problematic. Identification of 
children with mention of microcephaly in the medical record, the approach taken by many 
birth defects surveillance programs, will include children with a wide range of HC 
percentiles. In contrast, identification of all children with an HC below a certain percentile 
value would inevitably include some children who are constitutionally small but otherwise 
clinically normal, and currently is not logistically practical on a population basis.
The data in this report show a striking increase in the prevalence of microcephaly with 
decreasing gestational age and birth weight. Reference data for growth parameters at birth 
for very preterm infants tend to be based on smaller samples than for term infants, which 
may affect the precision of the reference values. The small size of these infants overall also 
might lead to increased mention of small head size in the medical record relative to that for 
larger preterm or term infants. Regardless of the accuracy of the measurement or diagnosis, 
variations in the proportion of preterm infants and low birth weight infants in populations 
could contribute to differences in the resulting estimates of the prevalence of microcephaly.

 The estimated prevalence of microcephaly in these data also varied by maternal race/
ethnicity, maternal age, and plurality. Children of Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black mothers 
had a substantially higher estimated prevalence of microcephaly compared with children of 
non-Hispanic White mothers and a moderately higher prevalence compared with children of 
non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Island mothers. The increased variability among prevalence 
estimates for Hispanics from programs using active case finding methods may partly be 
driven by the high proportion of this ethnic group in the active program that contributed the 
largest number of microcephaly cases. The fact that the median prevalence estimate among 
non-Hispanic Blacks was the highest regardless of ascertainment method supports the 
finding of a true higher prevalence of microcephaly in non-Hispanic Blacks.
As a result, the racial/ethnic distribution of mothers giving birth in different populations 
could contribute to differences in observed prevalence estimates for microcephaly. A U-
shaped distribution of microcephaly prevalence by maternal age was apparent for all racial/
ethnic groups examined, indicating that the age distribution of mothers in different 
populations also could contribute to differences in observed prevalence estimates. Similarly, 
the proportion of mothers giving birth to twin or higher multiple infants in different 
populations also could affect the estimated prevalence of microcephaly. While these 
deliveries generally constitute a small proportion of most populations, the increasing use of 
artificial reproductive technology and resultant increase in multiple births may vary across

CONCLUSIONS
The recent spread of Zika virus highlights the critical role that birth defects surveillance 
programs can play in response to an emerging epidemic or other public health threat 
affecting mothers and infants. This includes characterizing the public health impact of an 
exposure and monitoring the effects of prevention efforts. High quality population-based 
birth defects surveillance data can support a timely response to these threats. However, few 
birth defects surveillance programs in the United States currently have the infrastructure, 
resources, and personnel in place to conduct “rapid” surveillance for birth defects while 
simultaneously ensuring accuracy and completeness. Timeliness of reporting, case 
ascertainment, and data collection are all areas of potential improvement. The NBDPN 
continues to develop standards and tools to support programs to achieve this goal. In the 
absence of a nationwide population-based registry for birth defects, the data collected from 
state and territorial birth defects surveillance programs through the NBDPN provides the 
largest source of data regarding the prevalence of birth defects, including microcephaly, in 
the United States
