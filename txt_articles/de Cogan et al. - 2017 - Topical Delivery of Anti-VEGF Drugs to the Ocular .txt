PURPOSE. To evaluate the efficacy of anti-VEGF agents for treating choroidal neovascularization
(CNV) when delivered topically using novel cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) compared with
delivery by intravitreal (ivit) injection.
METHODS. CPP toxicity was investigated in cell cultures. Ivit concentrations of ranibizumab
and bevacizumab after topical administration were measured using ELISA. The biological
efficacy of topical anti-VEGF þ CPP complexes was compared with ivit anti-VEGF injections
using an established model of CNV
.
RESULTS. CPPs were nontoxic in vitro. In vivo, after topical eye drop delivery, CPPs were
present in the rat anterior chamber within 6 minutes. A single application of CPP þ
bevacizumab eye drop delivered clinically relevant concentrations of bevacizumab to the
posterior chamber of the rat eye in vivo. Similarly, clinically relevant levels of CPP þ
ranibizumab and CPP þ bevacizumab were detected in the porcine vitreous and retina ex
vivo. In an established model of CNV
, mice treated with either a single ivit injection of anti-
VEGF
, twice daily CPP þ anti-VEGF eye drops or daily dexamethasone gavage for 10 days all
had significantly reduced areas of CNV when compared with lasered eyes without treatment.
CONCLUSIONS. CPPs are nontoxic to ocular cells and can be used to deliver therapeutically
relevant doses of ranibizumab and bevacizumab by eye drop to the posterior segment of
mouse, rat, and pig eyes. The CPP þ anti-VEGF drug complexes were cleared from the retina
within 24 hours, suggesting a daily eye drop dosing regimen. Daily, topically delivered anti-
VEGF with CPP was as efficacious as a single ivit injection of anti-VEGF in reducing areas of
CNV in vivo.

n neovascular AMD (nAMD), VEGF stimulates growth of
blood vessels from the choroidal vasculature through
damaged Bruch’s membrane and into the retina. This leads to
compromised retinal function and ultimately retinal damage, a
condition for which anti-VEGF treatments are well estab-
lished.1,2 To attenuate the progressive visual loss, anti-VEGF
drugs are injected directly into the posterior segment of the
eye, which arrests the dysregulated vascularization process.3
Although anti-VEGF drugs are extremely successful treatments
for these vascular diseases, their repeated delivery by intravit-
real (ivit) injection is very stressful to patients, costly to
administer, and associated with significant complications,
including retinal detachment, subconjunctival hemorrhage,
uveitis, and endophthalmitis,3,4 all of which lead to poor
patient compliance.3 Therefore, there is an urgent and unmet
need for an alternative and less invasive drug-delivery route.5,6
Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been investigated as a
potential method of drug delivery since the discovery of the
protein transduction domain in the HIV-1 tat peptide in
1988.7–9 The internalization mechanism of these transduction
peptide-containing proteins into cells has not been fully
elucidated, with conflicting evidence for both active and
passive processes.10–13 Although short-sequence peptides have
been effectively used as chaperone agents to enhance the
delivery of small molecule therapeutics to retina cells following
subretinal injection,14 there is little evidence demonstrating
their utility as chaperones for large drug molecules aiding their
delivery to posterior segment tissues following topical applica-
tion to the cornea. Once proven, this route of drug delivery
would provide an alternative to the ivit injections used in
nAMD clinics.
Delivery of large and small drug molecules into the eye by
topical administration is a major challenge due to the unique
anatomy and physiology of the eye.15 The various layers of the
cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, and retina, along with the vascular
blood-aqueous and blood-retinal barriers, create formidable
static obstacles to drug penetration.16 Dynamic impediments to
drug delivery include the choroidal and conjunctival blood
flow, lymphatic clearance, efflux pumps, and tear dilution.17
These barriers combine to resist ocular drug delivery, especially
to tissues in the posterior segment. Virtually all currently used
eye drop formulations deliver their active agent (usually a small

 molecule drug) through the cornea, sclera, and conjunctiva
tissues by passive diffusion down the concentration gradient,
thereby accessing the anterior segment, with a small minority
of drugs also reaching the posterior segment in therapeutically
relevant concentrations.18,19
The therapeutic half-life of a drug is determined by its
potency, local titers, and bioavailability. Once inside the eye,
drugs are eliminated anteriorly via the aqueous outflow portals
or posteriorly through permeation of the blood-retinal barri-
er.20 Retinal delivery of clinically relevant quantities of large
drugs, like antibodies, by repeated topical administration to the
cornea has not yet been achieved. Large, negatively charged
biopharmaceutical macromolecules, such as ranibizumab
(Lucentis; Pharmaceuticals UK, Camberley, UK) (48 kD) and
bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA)
(149 kD), are administered as repeated ivit injections to access
retinal tissues.1,21 However, drug administration through this
route is invasive and carries the risk of significant complica-
tions, giving a relatively high cost-to-benefit ratio.22
Oligoarginine CPPs of varying lengths have previously been
used to aid drug delivery. For example, protein-peptide
complexes have been formed from intermolecular interactions
between oligoarginine and insulin proteins. These complexes
have cell-penetrating properties and are bioactive so that, for
example, peptides such as HWSYILRPRRRRRRK deliver
functional insulin across the gut epithelium both in vitro and
in vivo.23 Similarly, oligoarginine CPPs (RRRRRRR), covalently
linked to the topical anti-inflammatory drug cyclosporine A,
have enhanced drug penetration of the stratum cornea of the
skin to access the underlying epidermis.24
The aim of this study was to assess the potential for CPPs as
chaperones within a topical ocular drug-delivery platform for
the passage of therapeutic titers of high molecular weight
VEGF antagonists to the posterior segment of the eye.
Utilization of novel CPPs as ocular drug-delivery agents would
facilitate clinical administration of large biopharmaceuticals,
such as ranibizumab or bevacizumab, in the form of an eye
drop. The development of this eye drop delivery platform will
have wide-reaching implications for improved patient care, by
reducing the side effects and treatment costs associated with
both current clinically effective drugs and novel candidate
drugs. Here, we have evaluated CPP-mediated eye drop
delivery of anti-VEGF antibodies in rodent and porcine models
to determine dose delivery and pharmacokinetics. We also
have used an established in vivo rodent model of choroidal
neovascularization (CNV) to compare the efficacy of anti-VEGF
drugs when delivered topically with CPPs or by intravitreal
injection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Experiments
All animal procedures were performed under license in
accordance with the UK Home Office Animals Scientific
Procedures Act 1986 and the ARVO Statement for the Use of
Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.
Synthesis of CPPs
CPP (5[6]-carboxyfluorescein-RRRRRR-COOH) synthesis was
performed on a 1-mmol scale on preloaded Fmoc-Nw-
(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl)-L-arginine
Wang resin (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) (loading rate 0.62 mmol
g�1) using standard Fmoc–amino acid solid-state peptide
synthesis protocols. The initial Fmoc group was removed by
deprotection with 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) (3 3 20 minutes), followed by coupling with Fmoc-Nw-
(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl)-L-arginine
in the presence of O-(6-chlorobenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N0,N0-
tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HCTU), N,N-diiso-
propylethylamine (DIPEA), and DMF in a 1:5:5:10 molar ratio.
The reaction was agitated at room temperature for 8 hours, and
some of the resin was tested for reaction completion using the
ninhydrin test following standard protocols.25 The coupling
and deprotection steps were repeated until the peptide
sequence reached a total of six arginine residues. The final
Fmoc group was removed, the resin washed with DMF and
dichloromethane (DCM), and the free N-terminus was coupled
with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein in the presence of HCTU and
DIPEA in a 1:5:5:10 molar ratio in DMF for 8 hours, to give an
inbuilt fluorescent tag. After washes with DMF
, DCM, and
diethyl ether, the resin was air dried for 1 hour. The peptide
was cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (27
mL), thioanisole (1.5 mL), 1,2-ethanedithiol (0.9 mL), and
anisole (0.6 mL) under N2 with agitation in the dark for 3
hours, with simultaneous removal of side-chain protecting
groups. Resin was removed by filtration and the crude peptide
precipitated out of solution in cold diethyl ether and storage at
�208C for 8 hours. The precipitate was isolated by centrifuga-
tion at 2164g for 10 minutes and removal of the diethyl ether.
The peptide was purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC
on a Phenomenex Luna C12 column (250 3 21.2 C12 [2] 10-
lm Jupiter Proteo 90-˚
A Axia Packed [Phenomenex, Maccles-
field, UK]) with a solvent mixture altered with a linear gradient
from 0.1% TFA in water to 0.1% TFA in CH3CN over 40
minutes. The isolated peptide was lyophilized to yield a yellow
solid (258 mg, 19.6% yield at 97% purity), which was identified
by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Stock solutions
of the peptide were prepared in sterile PBS and stored at 48C
until use.
CPP-Therapeutic Complex Formation
CPPs (5 mg) were dissolved in stock solutions of bevacizumab
(25 mg/mL; Roche Pharmaceuticals, Welwyn Garden City, UK)
or ranibizumab (10 mg/mL; Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK). The
solution was vortexed for 10 seconds and stored at 48C until
use.
Circular Dichroism Analysis of CPP þ Drug
Complexes
Circular dichroism (CD) was used to characterize the effect of
concentration on CPP þ bevacizumab complex formation. CD
spectra were recorded in 1-mm pathlength quartz cuvettes on
a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco UK, Great Dunmow,
UK).26 The stock solution of bevacizumab (125 lg/mL) was
read at 200 to 300 nm. A stock solution of CPP was prepared at
1000 lg and diluted into the bevacizumab solution. The
observed ellipticity was converted to molar ellipticity.
In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assays
Primary Adult Rat Retinal Cell Cultures. Adult rats
(Sprague-Dawley; Charles River, Kent, UK) were killed by CO2
overdose and their eyes removed and the neural retinae
dissociated into single cells by using a papain dissociation kit,
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Wor-
thington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ, USA). Mixed retinal
cells, containing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), were seeded at
a density of 125,000 cells/well in 8-well chamber slides (BD
Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium), precoated with poly-d-
lysine and laminin (20 lg/mL) in 300-lL/well Neurobasal-A
supplemented with B27 supplement and gentamicin (all from

 Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).27 Retinal cell cultures were incubated
overnight at 378C and 5% CO2 and were treated the following
day with CPPs prepared from lyophilized stocks that were
made up in sterile PBS (1 mg, 6.9 lM) and diluted to final
concentrations of 100 lg/mL, 10 lg/mL, 1 lg/mL, and 0.1 lg/
mL in 500 lL culture medium/well. After 3 days of incubation
at 378C and 5% CO2, culture medium was removed and the
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Taab,
Reading, UK) for 10 minutes before being processed for
immunocytochemistry. Retinal cells were washed with rinsing
buffer (0.1% Triton-X 100 in PBS) for 3 3 5 minutes and
blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum [Vector Laboratories,
Peterborough, UK] and 3% BSA in rinsing buffer) was added at
150 lL/well for 30 minutes to block nonspecific protein
binding. Primary antibody against the RGC phenotypic marker
bIII-tubulin was added (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer, 150
lL/well) and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The
primary antibody solution was removed; the cells were
washed 3 3 5 minutes and then incubated with secondary
antibody (Alexa 488 anti-mouse IgG, 1:400 dilution in blocking
buffer; Invitrogen) at 150 lL/well for 1 hour in the dark. After
further washes as described, the chamber wells were removed
and the slides were mounted with Vectashield with 2-(4-
amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamideine dihydrochloride (DAPI)
(Vector Laboratories). The stained slides were viewed with an
Axioplan-2 fluorescence microscope and images were ob-
tained with Axiovision software (both Carl Zeiss, Ltd.,
Hertfordshire, UK). Each well was divided into a grid of nine
squares and two photomicrographs were taken within each
square (total 18 images/well). Surviving bIII-tubulinþ RGCs
were counted from these images and cell numbers per well
determined from two wells per condition in three indepen-
dent biological replicates.
Adult Human RPE (ARPE-19) Cell Cultures. Stock
human ARPE-19 cells28 (CRL-2032; ATCC, Middlesex, UK)
were cultured in T75 flasks (Sarstedt, Leicester, UK) in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with fetal bovine serum
(10%, vol/vol) (both from Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The
cells were passaged at 70% confluency by the addition of
trypsin-EDTA (2.5 mL) with a 5-minute incubation at 378C,
followed by replating. Cells were used between passage 4 and
passage 10. Cells for experiments were seeded into 24-well
cell culture plates (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) at a
cell density of 25,000 cells per well. A CPP solution was made
from lyophilized stock in sterile PBS (1 mg, 6.9 lM) and
diluted to 100 lg/mL, 10 lg/mL, 1 lg/mL, 0.1 lg/mL in the
cell culture media. The ARPE-19 cells were incubated at 378C
for 3 days, after which the media was removed and the cell
monolayer washed with PBS (1 mL). Fresh media (1 mL) was
added to each well with alamar blue salt (Sigma-Aldrich)
diluted in sterile PBS (10 lL, 150 lM).29 Wells with no cells
present were run as a technical control. The cells were
incubated for 2 hours at 378C for the alamar blue to be
metabolized, after which the alamar blue–containing media
was transferred to wells in a 96-well plate and the absorbance
read at 570 nm (kmax alamar blue) using a Glomax multi-
detection system (Promega, Southampton, UK). Cell number
was calculated by comparing the measured absorbance
against a standard curve of absorbance against known cell
number.30
Primary Adult Human Corneal Fibroblast Cultures.
Primary human corneal fibroblast (hCF) cells were cultured in
T75 flasks (Sarstedt) RPMI 1640 media supplemented with
fetal bovine serum (10% vol/vol) and 1% penicillin/streptomy-
cin (Invitrogen). Stock cell cultures were passaged at 70%
confluency using trypsin-EDTA. Experimental cells were
seeded in the same medium into 24-well cell culture plates
(Fisher Scientific) at a cell density of 50,000 cells per well. A
CPP solution was prepared as described previously in sterile
PBS (1 mg, 6.9 lM) and diluted to 100 lg/mL, 10 lg/mL, 1 lg/
mL, and 0.1 lg/mL in the cell culture media and the cells were
incubated with the various concentrations at 378C for 3 days.
The medium was removed and the hCF monolayers washed
three times by the addition and removal of PBS (1 mL). Fresh
media (1 mL) was added to each well together with alamar blue
salt in sterile PBS (10 lL, 150 lM). The cells were incubated for
2 hours at 378C for the alamar blue to be metabolized, after
which the alamar blue–containing media was transferred to
wells in a 96-well plate and the absorbance read on a Glomax
multidetection system at 570 nm (kmax alamar blue). Control
samples containing media and alamar blue without cells were
also run as an assay control. hCF number was calculated by
comparing with a standard curve of absorbance (measure of
metabolism rate) obtained from a known range of cell number.
In Vivo Anterior Segment Imaging of CPP Passage
Into the Rat Eye
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) (Charles River) were
anesthetized bu using 5% isoflurane (National Vet Supplies,
Stoke, UK) under Home Office Licence 30/2720. The rats had a
20-lL CPP eye drop applied to the cornea and the eyes were
imaged using a Spectralis Anterior Segment Module on the
Heidelberg Spectralis optical coherence tomography (OCT)
system (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) every
30 seconds for 10 minutes.
In Vivo CPP Delivery of Anti-VEGF Into the
Vitreous of Rat Eyes and the Time Course of Anti-
VEGF Clearance From the Vitreous and Retina
Under Home Office Licence 30/2720, adult male Sprague-
Dawley rats (200 g) (Charles River) had a single 20-lL eye drop
containing CPP (5 lg/lL), CPP (5 lg/lL) þ bevacizumab (25
lg/lL), bevacizumab (25 lg/lL), or PBS applied topically to
the corneal surface. The rats were rehoused and observed for
well-being for 30 minutes before killing by using rising levels of
CO2 and dissection of the ocular tissues. In a second study,
groups of rats were killed by rising levels of CO2 at 20, 40, and
60 minutes plus 2, 4, and 24 hours after anti-VEGF drug
delivery (n ¼ four rats per group), eyes were removed, and the
vitreous and retinae were harvested together. The combined
tissues were freeze-thawed and homogenized together in 110
lL sterile PBS. The level of bevacizumab in the retinal
homogenate was measured by using a Protein Detection ELISA
kit (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) with an anti-human antibody
(309-001-003; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratory, West
Grove, PA, USA). Briefly, high-affinity plates (Sigma-Aldrich)
were coated with 0.1 lg/mL anti-human antibody for 1 hour
and the ELISA was then carried out according to manufactur-
er’s instructions.
Ex Vivo Anti-VEGF Drug Delivery Into Porcine Eyes
Adult porcine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse,
stored on ice, and used within 3 hours of animal death. The
eyes were irrigated with PBS and then had a 60-lL eye drop
with and without drug applied to the cornea. After 45 minutes’
incubation period at room temperature, eyes were washed
three times with PBS and the vitreous and retina were
removed. Vitreous was freeze-thawed and homogenized,
retinal tissues were freeze-thawed and homogenized in 100
lL sterile PBS, the tissues were analyzed for ranibizumab and/
or bevacizumab levels by ELISA, as described previously.

 In Vivo Efficacy of Anti-VEGF Agent in a Mouse
Model of CNV
Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice (Harlan Laboratories, Derby,
UK) were maintained within the Biological Research Unit at
Queen’s University Belfast and the CNV study was performed at
this site in accordance with UK Home Office (Animals
[Scientific Procedures] Act, 1986) guidelines and the experi-
mental protocols were approved by the University Ethics
Committee. To create CNV
, mice were anesthetized by injection
of Rompun (xylazine) (2% wt/vol; Bayer, Newbury, UK) and
Ketaset (100 mg/mL; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Ltd., Hamp-
shire, UK) and rupture of Bruch’s membrane–choroid was
achieved by laser photocoagulation (Haag Streit BM 900 Slit
Lamp and Argon laser; Haag Streit, Harlow, UK) using CNV laser
burns of 100-lm spot size (0.05-second duration, 250 mW)
approximately two disc-diameters away from the optic disc.
Mice were randomly allocated into seven groups (Fig. 1): (1) (n
¼ 6) received CVN laser burn only; (2) (n ¼ 4) received CNV
laser burn and treatment with 0.5 mg/kg/d for 10 days of
dexamethasone delivered systemically through gavaging; (3) (n
¼ 6) received CNV laser burn and treatment with a single 2-lL
intravitreal injection of 200 ng/lL of anti-VEGF (R&D Systems,
Abingdon, UK; this is an established literature treatment of
murine angiogenesis31–34); (4) (n ¼ 6) received CNV laser burn
and treatment with a single 5-lL eye drop containing CPP 25
lg/5 lLþ anti-VEGF 1.8 lg/5 lL administered twice daily for 10
days; (5) (n ¼ 6) received CNV laser burn and treatment with a
single 5-lL eye drop containing PBS þ 1.8 lg/5 lL anti-VEGF
administered twice daily for 10 days; (6) (n ¼ 6) received CNV
laser burn and treatment with a single 5-lL eye drop containing
CPP 25 lg/5 lL, only administered twice daily for 10 days; and
(7) (n ¼ 6) received CNV laser burn and treatment with a single
5-lL PBS eye drop administered twice daily for 10 days. Just
before killing the mice on day 10, confocal scanning laser
ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg Engineering) was carried out
under anesthesia to obtain retinal angiography data immediately
after intravenous injection of 100 lL 10% sodium fluorescein.
Mice were killed by cervical dislocation and the eyes were
immediately dissected and placed in 2% PFA (Sigma-Aldrich) in
PBS for 2 hours. Following this, the PFA was removed and eyes
were stored in PBS at 48C for 5 days before being dissected. For
dissections, the RPE/choroid/sclera was removed in its entirety
and placed in PBS as a floating structure. The RPE/choroid/
sclera was washed again in PBS before permeabilization in 1%
Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1.5 hours at room tempera-
ture. After 3 washes in PBS, the floating tissue was immersed in
1/100 primary antibody against collagen (BioRad, Hertford-
shire, UK) and Isolectin B4 (Vector Laboratories) diluted in
0.5% Triton X-100 and 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in
PBS and left overnight at 48C. The following day, the tissue was
washed three times in PBS, before incubation with secondary
antibody (Alexa-594 for collagen and Fluorescent Strep 488 for
isolectin B4; Life Technology, Warrington, UK) at dilutions of 1/
200 and 1/100 in PBS þ 0.2% Triton, respectively for 1.5 hours
at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the tissue was
flatmounted and covered with Vectashield mounting medium
(Vector Laboratories).
The CNV lesion area in the flatmounted tissue was
visualized with a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope and the
collagen and isolectin-positive lesion area measured to identify
lesion size and new blood vessel formation and lesion size
using NIS Elements (Nikon, Amsterdam, UK). All images of
CNV lesions were analyzed using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.
gov/ij/; provided in the public domain by the National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Images were assigned
randomized numbers to ensure blinding of treatment groups
during quantification by the assessor. The number of pixels per
100 lm was set and used to determine area (lm2) of the CNV
lesion size shown by collagen IV and isolectin immunoreactiv-
ity. The area for each group was averaged and presented as
mean 6 SEM.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 17.0 (IBM
SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and data were presented as mean
6 SEM. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to ensure all data were
normally distributed before parametric testing by using a 1-way
ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test or a Mann-Whitney U test.
The homogeneity of variance was analyzed for all data; where
this was found to be statistically different, Games-Howell
analysis was used to determine statistical significance. The
statistical significance threshold was P < 0.05 (2-tailed).

 deg-cm2/dmol. This peak was enhanced to �2694.9 deg-cm2/
dmol when 150 lg CPP was added to bevacizumab (1 mL), to
�2689.4 deg-cm2/dmol with 300 lg CPP and to 2704.7 deg-
cm2/dmol with 500 lg CPP
. This indicates that CPPs form a
complex with bevacizumab, and that increasing the relative
concentration of CPP above 150 lg does not significantly alter
the complex structure.
CPPs Are Nontoxic for Rat Retinal, Human ARPE-19
Cells, and Human Corneal Fibroblasts
The CPPs were tested for cytotoxicity against a range of ocular
cells before in vivo testing via continuous exposure to CPP for
3 days in culture. In primary mixed retinal cultures from adult
rats, the numbers of bIII-tubulin þ RGC surviving after
treatment with CPP at concentrations of 0.1 lg/mL, 1 lg/mL,
10 lg/mL, and 100 lg/mL were not significantly different from
that in the PBS control (Fig. 3a). Similarly, in human ARPE-19
cells (Fig. 3b) cell numbers at the concentrations of 0.1 lg/mL,
1 lg/mL, 10 lg/mL, and 100 lg/mL CPP were not significantly
different from that in the PBS control. There was also no effect
on numbers of primary human corneal fibroblasts (Fig. 3c)
surviving after 3 days of treatment with CPP at any
concentration tested compared to the PBS control. These
results indicate that the CPPs were not cytotoxic to ocular cells
at the concentrations tested after 3 days in culture.
Eye Drop Formulations of CPP-Drug Complexes
Deliver Drugs Rapidly Across the Cornea to the
Anterior and Posterior Segments of the Rat Eye
Fluorescently tagged CPPs (20 lL of 5 lg/lL) were applied
topically to the cornea of an anesthetized rat and OCT images
were taken every 30 seconds. Fluorescent CPPs were observed
in solution on the surface of the cornea at 0 minutes and were
present within the anterior chamber by 6 minutes (Fig. 4A).
Further eye drop studies quantified the amount of anti-VEGF
antibody the CPP delivered across the cornea, to the anterior
and posterior segments, and into retinal tissue (Fig. 4B). When
a 20-lL eye drop of bevacizumab (25 lg/lL) complexed with
CPP (5 lg/lL) was applied to the cornea, 1.06 6 0.35 lg/mL of
bevacizumab was detected by ELISA within tissue homoge-
nates after 30 minutes. This represented 0.2% of the delivered
pay load. This level was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than
that seen in all controls. Clearance of bevacizumab from the
retina following delivery by topical application was then
established by examining retinal levels of bevacizumab over
time (Fig. 4C). This showed that 0.68 6 0.26 lg/mL
bevacizumab was detected within the tissue homogenates at
20 minutes after topical administration, with levels increasing
to 1.65 6 0.26 lg/mL at 40 minutes, followed by decreasing
levels, with 0.4 6 0.22 lg/mL detectable at 4 hours and 0.007
6 0.22 lg/mL at 24 hours after topical application. This shows
a clearance of bevacizumab from the rodent retina by 24 hours,
suggesting a daily dosing regimen would be required to sustain
therapeutic levels by eye drop drug delivery in disease model
studies and also implies the need for daily dosing in humans.
CPP-Drug Complexes Access Retinal Tissues After
Eye Drop Delivery to the Pig Eye
Eye drops of 20 lL, containing ranibizumab (10 lg/lL)
complexed with CPP or bevacizumab (25 lg/lL) complexed
with CPP
, or appropriate controls, were applied topically to
porcine cornea, and after 45 minutes vitreous and retinae were
dissected and the levels of human IgG measured by ELISA (Figs.
5a, 5b). The levels of human IgG measured indicate that, when
drugs were complexed with CPP
, topical delivery achieved 17.09
6 4.68 lg/mL of ranibizumab and of 10.68 6 3.57 lg/mL of
bevacizumab in the total vitreous. This represented significantly
higher (P < 0.001) levels than those seen in control animals,
treated with eye drops containing either uncomplexed ranibizu-
mab, uncomplexed bevacizumab eye, CPP-alone, or PBS-alone.
Similarly, 0.10 6 0.03 lg per retina of bevacizumab was detected
in the retina after application of CPPþbevacizumab complex eye
drops. This was also significantly higher than levels in the control
groups (P < 0.005).

induce a change in the CPP þ bevacizumab reflecting complex formation, but increasing the amount of the CPP does not induce further change.

 Eye Drop CPP–Anti-VEGF Complexes Attenuate
Neovascularization in a Mouse Model of CNV
The bioefficacy of anti-VEGF when delivered topically
complexed to CPP was determined in a mouse model of
CNV
. Fluorescein angiography (FA) and infrared imaging (IR)
at 10 days in all groups demonstrated that eye drop delivery of
CPP þ anti-VEGF complexes considerably reduced the size of
the laser-induced CNV lesion, characterized by an area of
hyperfluorescence surrounding a core of hypofluorescence
(Fig. 6). This lesion denotes an area of high neovascularization
that leads to fluorescein leakage and, therefore, the increased
fluorescence levels observed. When the size of the untreated
CNV fluorescent halos were compared with those in the
lasered treatment group receiving eye drops containing
uncomplexed anti-VEGF or the three negative control groups,
no differences were apparent. By contrast, smaller CNV
fluorescent halos were measured in the two positive control
groups receiving daily systemic dexamethasone by gavage or a
single anti-VEGF ivit injection. RPE/choroidal flatmount

 immunohistochemistry of collagen IV and isolectin B4 (as

 all three treatment groups were significantly lower than those
in CNV eyes that received no treatment (P < 0.001), with no
significant difference among the three treatment groups.
Lesion areas in the negative control groups of CPP-only eye
drops (89,540 6 14,706 lm2), anti-VEGF–only drops (112,802
6 18,855 lm2), and PBS eye drops (105,714 6 25,149 lm2)
were all significantly higher than those in animals that
received CPP delivered anti-VEGF (P < 0.001), with no
significant difference between these negative controls and
those animals that received no treatment. These data show
that daily topical administration of the CPP complexed with
anti-VEGF was as efficacious as the standard single ivit
injection of anti-VEGF
.
DISCUSSION
Anti-VEGF agents are a well-established treatment for nAMD1,2;
however, the side effects from delivery by ivit injection
represent a significant problem.3,4 Accordingly, this study
investigated the use of CPP as a novel topical delivery vehicle
for anti-VEGF agents to the posterior segment, negating the
need for invasive ivit injections. This study demonstrates that
CPP can successfully deliver topically applied anti-VEGF drugs
into mouse, rat, and pig eyes, and showed bioactivity of the
topically delivered drug in a relevant disease model that was
equivalent to other AMD drug-delivery methods.30
The use of CPPs as drug-penetration enhancers is well
described in the literature. For example, CPPs can be
covalently coupled to psoriasis drugs to enhance transdermal
delivery.35 Although this study further illustrates the clinical
potential of penetration enhancers, CPP platform technologies
have not previously been established, as each drug has been
delivered using a novel CPP attachment method. For example,
previous work by Johnson et al.36 reports the delivery of green
fluorescent protein to the cornea after topical application and
to the retina after ivit injection. However, this work relied on
FIGURE 5.

CPP þ anti-VEGF eye drops resulted in significantly higher microgram titers of bevacizumab and ranibizumab measured in the vitreous compared
with PBS-alone (control group), CPP-alone, bevacizumab-alone, and ranibizumab-alone eye drop application. (b) Titers of bevacizumab delivered to
the porcine retina using eye drops. ELISA data demonstrated that CPP þ bevacizumab complexes delivered significantly higher levels of
bevacizumab compared with PBS (control group), CPP-alone, and bevacizumab-alone. This demonstrates the effectiveness of CPP to carry clinically
relevant titers of both drugs to the posterior segment in an eye of comparable size to the human eye (n ¼ 3, ***P < 0.01).

 grafting the CPP to the therapeutic load and (for posterior
segment delivery) an injection either intravitreally or subreti-
nally.32
In contrast, here we have exploited simple charge-based
interactions between the CPP and the therapeutic to formulate
drug complexes that are decorated by the CPP
. This enhances
drug passage across tissue barriers, both into cells and between
cells, and also ensures that drug bioefficacy is not compro-
mised by the permanent attachment of the CPP unit onto the
drug molecule. Accordingly, current drug stockpiles and
methods of manufacture can be used in preparing the CPP-
drug complexes.
The CPP concentration estimated in different anatomical
compartments through the eye after eye drop delivery
informed the in vitro investigations into CPP toxicity for
ocular cells after 3 days in culture. Examination of the literature
shows that poly-arginine–based CPPs have been tested
extensively against many cell types, with reports conflicting
whether CPPs inflict toxic effects on cells.37–39 Here, topical
delivery by eye drop delivered 5 mg/mL CPP onto the cornea,

vessels, with light areas of hyperfluorescence surrounding a central dark hypofluorescent core (scale bar: 200 lm). Using SLO to perform both FA
and IR together allows the identification of potential areas of damage in both retina and choroid.

 with 85 lg/mL calculated to be present in the posterior
segment after 30 minutes, based on the detected presence of
the anti-VEGF
. These values were then used to provide the
concentration range to test toxicity on cultured rodent and
human ocular cells. The CPPs used in this study showed no
apparent toxicity to any ocular cell type tested between 0.1
and 100 lg/mL.
The speed of drug penetration and delivery to the retina
after application to the corneal surface of the eye is vital,18 as
drugs in aqueous solution are cleared from the tear film in 15
to 30 seconds, so it was important to measure the rate of
transfer of CPP þ bevacizumab and CPP þ ranibizumab
complexes across the cornea. OCT of the rat eye over 10
minutes showed that fluorescent CPP complexes were

 observed in the anterior chamber by 6 minutes. ELISA at later
time points showed that levels of bevacizumab delivered by a
CPP complex to retinal tissue increased over the first hour, to
reach a maximum of 1 lg, representing 0.2% of the topically
applied pay load. Retinal levels decreased over the following 24
hours as the drug was cleared from the tissue, although the
drug was still detectable in retinal tissues at very low levels
after 24 hours. These results demonstrate the ability of CPP to
form complexes with humanized antibody drugs and aid
delivery across tissue barriers to access posterior segment
target tissues in the physiologically relevant lg/mL concentra-
tion range indicated in literature data.17,18 These studies were
carried out in rodent eyes in which the ocular volume and
delivery path length do not allow comparisons with the human
eye. For example, the average thickness of the human cornea
measures 535 6 20 lm in the center compared with 118 6 8
lm of the central mouse cornea.40 Therefore, ex vivo studies
were carried out in porcine eyes that have a corneal thickness
of 666 6 123 lm, making them more comparable to a human
eye.41 Similar titers of antibody were delivered to the porcine
posterior segment, suggesting relevance of the delivery
strategy to the human eye.
The in vivo rat and ex vivo porcine observations prompt
two conclusions. First, that, after topical delivery complexed to
CPPs, ranibizumab and bevacizumab can access retinal tissues
from the vitreous in a similar manner to that after direct ivit
injection. Second, a dosing regimen that is comparable to
current clinical practice is relevant to this delivery route. The
current ‘‘gold standard’’ dosing regimen in patients is monthly
injections of 300 to 500 lg/eye ranibizumab or 100 to 300 lg/
eye bevacizumab. Preclinical studies have shown that 0.5 days
after a 500 lg/eye injection, detectable levels in the vitreous
are approximately 200 lg/mL.42 Ranibizumab has a relatively
short half-life in the vitreous of 4 days, with no detectable
levels seen in preclinical trials 10 days after a single ivit
injection.34 Our rat study also showed that the drug cleared
from the vitreous over 24 hours, allowing inferences to be
made for human vitreal clearance patterns.36 Clinical trials
have demonstrated that, after ivit injection of 1500 lg/eye of
bevacizumab, clearance from the aqueous humor leaves 33 lg/
mL of drug at 1 day postinjection, dropping to less than 10 lg/
mL by day 18.43 Human intravitreal concentrations of
bevacizumab have been shown at 166 lg/mL at 2 days
postinjection and 0.5 lg/mL at 4 weeks postinjection.44 This
indicates a target delivery level to the human retina of between
1 and 200 lg/eye over 4 weeks. Therefore, in the porcine study
reported here, the CPP þ anti-VEGF ratio was optimized to
effect drug delivery in this therapeutic range. The delivery of
10 to 20 lg/mL to the posterior segment achieved in the ex
vivo porcine study is within the established therapeutic range
for humans (10–200 lg/mL). Although low levels of IgG were
detected in the control groups, this was observed due to low
levels of cross reactivity of the antibody with porcine IgG,
already observed by Davis et al.45 The topical CPP-mediated
drug delivery showed drug clearance over 24 hours, with most
of the anti-VEGF cleared from the ocular tissues by 4 hours.
This indicates the potential for twice/thrice daily eye drops to
give a repeated, sustained dose that would maintain therapeu-
tic levels of drug in the eye for sustained periods. Future
studies will determine systemic levels of the delivered anti-
VEGF reflecting systemic clearance of the drug from the eye.
Once the dosing regimen and therapeutic levels achievable
were determined, the CPP þ anti-VEGF eye drop was tested in
an established murine model of CNV to determine bioefficacy
of the drug delivered using this route. It should be noted that
the absence of a defined macula in mice and the laser trauma
model used does not accurately mimic the complexity of the
human pathology. This model is effectively a wound-healing
reaction that follows an insult at the level of Bruch’s membrane
and relies heavily on inflammation. In contrast in AMD, genetic
susceptibility plays a major role in disease progression; hence,
why steroids can be used for treatment in the mouse model but
are ineffective in humans.46 However, the mouse laser model
does allow assessment of the effects of anti-VEGF on
neovascularization, an important component of AMD patho-
physiology.
RPE/choroid flatmount immunohistochemistry of collagen
IV and isolectin B4 (as markers of neovascularization and
endothelial cells, respectively, that revealed the lesion area)
supported the conclusions derived from in vivo imaging of
fluorescein leakage from vessels. Animals that received daily
dexamethasone gavage, a single ivit anti-VEGF injection, or
twice-daily eye drops for 10 days containing CPP þ anti-VEGF
complexes all had significantly smaller areas of collagen and
isolectin B4 staining, indicative of smaller CNV lesions when
compared with the three negative control groups of PBS, CPP-
alone, and anti-VEGF–alone eye drops. These results obtained
with eye drop delivery of CPP–anti-VEGF accord well with the
results of other published studies using the CNV model to
demonstrate the efficacy of a range of anti-VEGF drugs that
significantly reduce the area of choroidal neovasculariza-
tion.47–50
In summary, these data indicate the utility of a novel
noninvasive eye drop delivery mechanism for nAMD drugs.
The CPP-drug eye drops have potential to significantly impact
the treatment of nAMD by revolutionizing drug-delivery
options. Efficacious self-administered drug application by eye
drop would lead to a significant reduction in adverse outcomes
and health care costs compared with current treatments. The
CPP þ drug complex also has potential application to other
chronic ocular diseases that require drug delivery to the
posterior chamber of the eye.
CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated a novel platform eye drop technology
for ocular drug delivery that is broadly applicable because it
does not require chemical conjugation of the drug chaperone.
Specifically, we have shown that CPPs have high penetrating
capabilities for biological barriers in the eye with low toxicity
and can deliver clinically relevant concentrations of anti-VEGF
drugs, such as ranibizumab and bevacizumab, to the posterior
segment of the eye. In particular, these CPPs have the capacity
to noninvasively deliver therapeutics in bioactive form to
anterior and posterior ocular segments to give outcomes
comparable to intravitreally injected drugs. If the results were
translated to human eyes, it would allow the topical delivery of
a wide range of ocular drugs that currently can be delivered
only by ivit or subconjunctival injections. This would reduce
treatment costs, time in clinic, and harmful side effects, while
allowing patient self-administration, so that new drug-delivery
regimens can be better tolerated.
