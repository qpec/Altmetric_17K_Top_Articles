RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
What is the role of dual antiplatelet therapy after high 
risk transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke? Specifi-
cally, does dual antiplatelet therapy with a combination 
of aspirin and clopidogrel lead to a greater reduction in 
recurrent stroke and death over the use of aspirin alone 
when given in the first 24 hours after a high risk transient 
ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke? An expert 
panel produced a strong recommendation for initiating 
dual antiplatelet therapy within 24 hours of the onset of 
symptoms, and for continuing it for 10-21 days. Current 
practice is typically to use a single drug.
The recommendations in this clinical practice guide-
line are based on a linked systematic review1 triggered by 
a randomised controlled trial published in the New Eng-
land Journal of Medicine in August 2018.2 This trial and 
the linked review found that dual antiplatelet therapy 
(DAPT) with clopidogrel and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) 
during the first 21 days after the index event reduced the 
risk of recurrent major ischaemic events compared with 
aspirin monotherapy.
This Rapid Recommendation aims to quickly and 
transparently translate evidence for working clinicians 
and their patients in adherence with standards for trust-
worthy guidelines and the GRADE system.3-5 A panel free 
of financial conflicts of interest, and including patients, 
drafted the recommendations. We have managed intel-
lectual interests.
Box 1 shows all of the articles and evidence linked 
in this Rapid Recommendation package. The core info-
graphic provides an overview of the absolute benefits 
and harms for DAPT compared with aspirin monotherapy.
Current practice
Single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel 
is an effective intervention for both short and long term 
secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischaemic 
attack after an index event. Clinicians sometimes use 
alternatives of cilostazole or a combination of dipyrida-
mole and aspirin, both referred to for this recommenda-
tion as single agent therapy.6-9
Aspirin and clopidogrel have synergistic action to 
inhibit platelet aggregation. So it is plausible that the two 
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
•   
People with high risk transient ischaemic 
attack or minor ischaemic stroke are at an 
increased risk of recurrent stroke and death
•   
Aspirin and clopidogrel decrease this risk, 
even more so when used in combination
•   
We make a strong recommendation for dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel 
and aspirin to be started within 24 hours in 
patients who have had a high risk transient 
ischaemic attack or minor stroke
•   
We make a strong recommendation for DAPT 
to be continued for 10-21 days, at which 
point patients should continue with single 
antiplatelet therapy
•   
DAPT is not to be used for major stroke 
because of the increased risk of intracranial 
bleeding in these patients

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1: Dual vs single antiplatelet therapy (continued)
Two different tablets taken once daily at same time
Aspirin tablet should be swallowed whole, but clopidogrel tablet can be crushed or split
A single aspirin tablet once daily 
Although dosing varied slightly in the included trials, for 
clopidogrel, most physicians and patients would probably 
prefer a loading dose of 300 mg rather than a higher 
dose. For aspirin, a daily dose between 75 mg and 81 mg 
represents a reasonable choice.
Dosing
The panel believes almost all patients place a high value on 
avoiding a recurrent stroke and a lower value on avoiding 
moderate or major bleeding.

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
drugs together may provide better secondary prevention 
of stroke than one. However, they are not in widespread 
use for various reasons:
•   
They are not useful in the long term after stroke—
Several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
have examined if DAPT (aspirin and clopidogrel) 
is better at preventing recurrent stroke than single 
agent antiplatelet therapy. However, DAPT was no 
better than single agent therapy.10 11
•   
They are considered too risky after major stroke—
Major strokes, as opposed to minor ones, are treated 
with single agent only because of the higher risk of 
haemorrhagic transformation.
•   
The balance of benefit and harm is uncertain for 
short term use after minor stroke or high risk transient 
ischaemic attack—In the days and weeks after such 
an event there is an increased risk of a second 
ischaemic event. This uncertainty in the setting of 
acute transient ischaemic attacks and minor stroke 
could have been reduced by the recent RCT.
Table 1 outlines how international guidelines vary. A 
minority make a weak recommendation or suggestion for 
short term DAPT. It also shows some international vari-
ation in the single agents that are recommended in the 
long term. The NICE guideline favours clopidogrel over 
others, and combined aspirin and dipyridamole over 
aspirin, whereas most guidelines consider all three as 
equivalent options. 
The ABCD2 score and NIHSS score are typically used 
to help assess the severity of a transient ischaemic attack 
or stroke and can help to guide future care. Around 1 in 
10 people go on to have a stroke after high risk transient 
ischaemic attack (box 2). The chance of a further stroke 
soon after minor stroke is less clear but is likely to be 
around 10-12% range.
The evidence
The linked systematic review1 found three RCTs exam-
ining DAPT versus aspirin alone reporting on a total of 
10 447 patients.2-16 Figure 2 provides an overview of the 
RCTs and RCT participants. Overall, patients included 
in these trials were similar to those seen in everyday 
practice. Mean age varied from 62 to 68.1 years. In the 
FASTER trial 1/6 of the patients were older than 81 years; 
in CHANCE 1/4 of patients were over 72; and in POINT 
1/4 were over 85. Just over half of participants (52.8-
66.2%) were male.
Compared with single antiplatelet therapy, 
•   
DAPT decreased all (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) 
non-fatal recurrent stroke (risk ratio 0.70 (95% 
confidence interval 0.61 to 0.80), high certainty)
Table 1 | Current recommendations for antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of stroke
Guideline
Antiplatelet to be used
Statement
AHA/ASA 20186
• Aspirin  
• DAPT 
Aspirin (50 to 325mg) monotherapy, combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, and clopidogrel 
monotherapy are all acceptable options for initial therapy for patients with non-cardioembolic stroke or TIA.  
For patients with minor stroke, treatment for 21 days with DAPT begun within 24 hours can be beneficial for early 
secondary stroke prevention for up to 90 days from symptom onset
Canadian Stroke Best Practice 
guideline 20177
• Aspirin  
• Combined aspirin and dipyridamole  
• Clopidogrel
Aspirin 80-325 mg daily, combined aspirin 25 mg and extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg twice daily, or 
clopidogrel 75 mg daily are appropriate options and selection should depend on clinical circumstances
Australian Clinical Guidelines 
for Stroke Management 201712
• Low dose aspirin  
• Clopidogrel 
• Combined low dose aspirin and modified 
release dipyridamole 
• DAPT
Long term antiplatelet therapy (low dose aspirin, clopidogrel, or combined low dose aspirin and modified release 
dipyridamole) should be prescribed to all people with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack who are not 
prescribed anticoagulation therapy, taking into consideration patient comorbidities.  
For high risk patients with minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, DAPT may be used in the first three 
weeks to prevent stroke recurrence.  
DAPT should not be used for long term secondary prevention of cerebrovascular disease in people who do not 
have acute coronary disease or recent coronary stent
NICE 201613
• Clopidogrel 
• Aspirin with modified release dipyridamole 
• Modified release dipyridamole
For long term vascular prevention in people with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack without 
paroxysmal or permanent atrial fibrillation, clopidogrel 75 mg daily should be standard antithrombotic treatment.  
Aspirin 75 mg daily with modified-release dipyridamole 200 mg twice daily should be used for those who are 
unable to tolerate clopidogrel. 
Aspirin 75 mg daily should be used if both clopidogrel and modified release dipyridamole are contraindicated or 
not tolerated. 
Modified release dipyridamole 200 mg twice daily should be used if both clopidogrel and aspirin are 
contraindicated or not tolerated. 
The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is not recommended unless there is another indication (such as acute 
coronary syndrome, recent coronary stent)
AHA/ASA = American Heart Association/American Stroke Association. NICE = National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. DAPT = dual antiplatelet therapy of clopidogrel plus aspirin.
Box 2 | Assessment of severity of transient ischaemic 
attack and minor stroke and subsequent risk of stroke
Transient ischaemic attack
• Severity assessed by ABCD2 score:
 
– Age—1 point if ≥60 years 
 
– Blood pressure—1 point if ≥140/90 mm Hg
 
– Clinically—1 point if speech disturbance only, 2 points if 
unilateral weakness
 
– Duration—1 point if 10 minutes to 1 hour, 2 points if 
≥1 hour
 
– Diabetes—1 point if present
• Subsequent risk of stroke based on ABCD2 score:
 
– Score 1-3 (low)=1.2% at 7 days
 
– Score 4-5 (moderate)=5.9% at 7 days
 
– Score 6-7 (high)=11.7% at 7 days
Minor stroke
• Severity defined as NIHSS score ≤3
• Subsequent risk of stroke not well characterised but likely 
equal to that of a high risk transient ischaemic attack
NIHSS = National Institute of Health Stroke Scale.14 Scale ranges from 0 to 42, 
based on assessment of 15 measures of motor and sensory function, language and 
speech production, vision, level of consciousness and attention, and neglect. The 
elements are summed to provide an overall assessment of stroke severity. A score 
of 0 to 3 or 4 indicates mild stroke, 5-14 moderate, 15-24 moderately severe, and 
≥25 severe.

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
•   
DAPT led to small improvements in functional 
disability (moderate certainty) and quality of life 
(moderate certainty)
•   
DAPT led to a small, possibly important increase in 
moderate or major extracranial bleeding (moderate 
certainty) (see main infographic).
The RCTs varied from 396 participants to 5170; the 
two largest trials contributed 10 051 patients. One trial 
was conducted in China,15 one in North America,16 and 
one, the POINT trial,2 in 269 study sites from 10 countries 
worldwide. The POINT trial2 included a diverse popula-
tion and may therefore be more generalisable than the 
CHANCE trial, which included only Chinese patients.15 
All trials defined minor stroke as a National Institutes of 
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≤3 at the time of ran-
domisation (scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores 
indicating greater deficits). The two large trials defined 
high risk transient ischaemic attacks as an ABCD2 score 
of ≥4 (see box 2 for details) at the time of randomisation.17 
In all trials, patients had undergone computed tomog-
raphy (CT) scan or magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) to 
exclude the presence of cerebral haemorrhage or alter-
native explanations for their symptoms. Enrolment had 
to take place within 12-24 hours of onset of symptoms.

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
from the control arm of the POINT trial because it was 
a mu 
ltinational study and so the population was more 
diverse.
Overall, the panel was confident that DAPT, when 
started within 24 hours of symptom onset and used 
for 10-21 days:
   
– Reduces non-fatal recurrent stroke (ischaemic and 
haemorrhagic) in the first 90 days by 1.9% (high 
quality evidence)
   
– Reduces the incidence of moderate or severe 
functional disability by 1.4% (moderate quality 
evidence)
   
– Reduces the incidence of poor quality of life by 
1.3% (moderate quality evidence).
However, DAPT has little or no impact on:
   
– All-cause mortality (moderate quality evidence).
   
– Incidence of myocardial infarction or recurrent 
transient ischaemic attack (moderate quality 
evidence).
Furthermore, DAPT also has some harms:
   
– A small (0.2%), possibly important increase in 
moderate to major extracranial bleeding events 
(moderate quality evidence)
   
– A small increase in the risk of minor extracranial 
bleeding events by 0.7% (high quality evidence).
Patient-important functional disability was defined as 
modified Rankin scale score of ≥2 as defined by the panel 
(see table 2).
Duration of DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin
The panel was confident that DAPT given for 10-21 days 
compared with 22-90 days results in:
•   
Absolute risk decrease of 0.4% in recurrent 
ischaemic stroke (moderate quality evidence of 
no benefit on stroke reduction with prolonged 
clopidogrel)
•   
Absolute risk decrease of 0.3% in moderate to major 
bleeding events (high quality evidence).
The maximum benefit occurred in the first 10 days. 
Values and preferences
The panel discussed how patients might weigh the benefit 
of reduced stroke with DAPT against its harm of increased 
bleeding. The panel believed that most patients would 
consider a stroke considerably worse than a bleed and 
so would choose DAPT over single agent therapy. There 
was no published evidence to support this from patients 
considering DAPT, but this view is consistent with a sys-
tematic review of values and preferences in decision mak-
ing for antithrombotic therapy.18 In that scenario patients 
considered non-fatal stroke (thrombotic or haemorrhagic) 
to be two to three times worse than serious gastrointes-
tinal bleeding.
The panel believed that all or almost all patients would 
choose 10-21 days of therapy rather than 22-90 days as 
shorter therapy is associated with equivalent benefit and 
less harm.
Practical issues
Figure 3 outlines the key practical considerations.
When should patients begin their DAPT?
If brain imaging is done within 24 hours of onset of symp-
toms, patients should begin DAPT as soon as the imaging 
results exclude intracranial haemorrhage or stroke-mim-
icking lesions. If a delay of 24 hours or more in imaging is 
suspected, then patients should begin DAPT as soon as a 
clinician makes a diagnosis of minor ischaemic stroke or 
transient ischaemic attack, be the clinician a primary care 
doctor or stroke neurologist, and be the setting inpatient 
or outpatient. Such patients should have imaging as soon 
as possible.
How should patients respond if experiencing adverse 
effects of DAPT?
We are most confident of the stroke reduction with clopi-
dogrel in the first seven days after commencement. If 
adverse effects are minor, patients may be well advised 
to continue until at least seven days.
Dosing of antiplatelets
There were no head to head comparisons in the studies 
to give clear guidance on what loading and maintenance 
dose to offer. However, the following considerations may 
be useful:
•   
For clopidogrel—A loading dose of 300 mg and a 
dose of 75 mg thereafter seem reasonable because 
bleeding was marginally greater in the POINT trial,2 
which used a higher loading dose (table 3)
•   
For aspirin—A dose between 75 mg and 345 mg 
seems reasonable. The results of the trials do not 
offer particular insights. Some clinicians may 
prefer to prescribe at the low end of this range to 
minimise harm. However, other clinicians may 
wish to take into account recent evidence of dosing 
based on weight from studies in primary prevention 
of cardiovascular events and long term secondary 
prevention of stroke.19
The addition of a second agent, likely clopidogrel, adds 
to the immediate cost of treatment. This drug is, however, 
widely available and relatively inexpensive, and the dura-
tion of use is short. Moreover, the cost savings related to 
stroke reduction are likely to be as much or more than the 
costs of clopidogrel administration.
Uncertainties
The following remains uncertain for clinicians and 
patients:
•   
What is the optimal starting dose of clopidogrel or 
aspirin? What is the optimal maintenance dose of 
both agents?

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
•   
What are the benefits and risks of DAPT with 
clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with low risk 
transient ischaemic attack compared with aspirin 
alone?
•   
What are the risks and benefits of DAPT in patients 
with moderate strokes (NIHSS score 3-10) with or 
without thrombolysis treatment?
•   
What are the benefits and risks of DAPT with 
clopidogrel and aspirin compared with clopidogrel 
alone in this population?
Updates to this article
Table 4 shows evidence that has emerged since the publi-
cation of this article. As new evidence is published, a group 
will assess the new evidence and make a judgment on to 
what extent it is expected to alter the recommendation.

HOW THIS RECOMMENDATION WAS CREATED
This guideline was triggered by a randomised controlled trial that compared dual antiplatelet 
therapy (DAPT, clopidogrel plus aspirin) with aspirin monotherapy given within 12-24 hours 
of symptom onset in patients with high-risk transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke.2 
This added to a previous DAPT trial published in 2013.15 The Rapid Recommendations team 
thought that the results had the potential to change practice.
The scope of the recommendation and the patient-important outcomes were defined 
by an international guideline panel consisting of three patients with lived experience of 
stroke, one adult who cared for someone with a stroke, five stroke neurologists, one vascular 
surgeon, one health research methodologist, five general internists (four who are also 
methodologists), one nurse, one physiotherapist, and one critical care physician (who is 
also a methodologist) (see appendix 1 on bmj.com for details of panel members). The panel 
judged death, non-fatal stroke, major extracranial bleeding, functional ability, and quality 
of life as critical outcomes. Myocardial infarction, recurrent transient ischaemic attack, and 
minor extracranial bleeding were judged less important.
The panel requested a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs examining the 
benefits and harms of DAPT versus single agent antiplatelet in order to inform the 
recommendation. The panel then met online to discuss the evidence and to formulate 
recommendations. In our judgment no panel member had relevant financial conflicts 
of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and transparently 
described (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).
The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy 
recommendation,20 21 including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence 
and translate it to recommendations (see appendix 2 on bmj.com).4 The panel considered the 
benefits, harms and burdens of DAPT versus single antiplatelet therapy, the quality (certainty) 
of the evidence for each outcome, variations in patient values and preferences, as well as 
acceptability and feasibility.22 Following the GRADE based approach, recommendations can 
be strong or weak for or against a specific course of action.23 The recommendations take a 
patient-centred perspective that de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer 
points of view. Healthcare systems can adapt these recommendations by including costs and 
other key issues of relevance, contextualised to national and local circumstances.
HOW PATIENTS WERE INVOLVED IN THE CREATION 
OF THIS ARTICLE
Three people with lived experience of stroke, and 
one person with lived experience as a carer for a patient 
with stroke, were full panel members. They identified 
and rated outcomes, and led the discussion on values 
and preferences. The patient partners rated all included 
outcomes as important to them. Although these values may 
not be shared by all patients for all outcomes considered, 
the panel expected little variation in how much importance 
other patients would place on the critical outcomes of 
recurrent non-fatal stroke, moderate to major bleeding 
events, all-cause mortality, functional disability and quality 
of life. 
Patients and carers were instrumental to this guideline 
in weighing the benefits and harms of DAPT. They clearly 
articulated the consistent view that avoiding recurrent 
stroke is paramount in those with transient ischaemic 
attack and minor stroke and that most would be willing to 
risk extracranial bleeding to achieve this.
We thank them for their time and valuable input.
P
EDUCATION INTO PRACTICE
• For prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with recent 
transient ischaemic attacks or minor stroke, which 
antiplatelet or combination of antiplatelets do you prescribe?
• How do you identify patients with transient ischaemic 
attacks as high risk or low risk?
• How do you classify stroke as minor or major?
• Based on this article, how do you think your personal 
practice might change? Is there anything that you 
would do differently for patients with high risk transient 
ischaemic attack or minor stroke?
