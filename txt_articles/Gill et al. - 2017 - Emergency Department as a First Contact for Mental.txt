Objective: To characterize youth who use the emergency
department (ED) as a “first contact” for mental health
(MH) problems.
Method: This was a population-based cross-sectional
cohort
study
using
linked
health
and
demographic
administrative datasets of youth 10 to 24 years of age with
an incident MH ED visit from April 1, 2010, to March 31,
2014, in Ontario, Canada. We modeled the association of
demographic, clinical, and health service use characteris-
tics with having no prior outpatient MH care in the pre-
ceding 2-year period (“first contact”) using modified
Poisson models.
Results: Among 118,851 youth with an incident mental
health ED visit, 14.0% were admitted. More than half
(53.5%) had no prior outpatient MH care, and this was
associated with younger age (14�17 versus 22�24 years
old: risk ratio [RR] ¼ 1.09, 95% CI ¼ 1.07�1.10), rural
residence (RR ¼ 1.16, 95% CI ¼ 1.14�1.18), lowest versus
highest income quintile (RR ¼ 1.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.03�1.06),
and refugee immigrants (RR ¼ 1.17, 95% CI ¼ 1.13�1.21)
and other immigrants (RR ¼ 1.10, 95% CI ¼ 1.08�1.13)
versus nonimmigrants. The 5.1% of the cohort without a
usual provider of primary care had the highest risk of first
contact (RR ¼ 1.78, 95% CI ¼ 1.77�1.80). A history of low-
acuity ED use and individuals whose primary care phy-
sicians were in the lowest tertile for mental health visit
volumes were associated with higher risk.
Conclusion: More than half of youth requiring ED care
had not previously sought outpatient MH care. Associa-
tions with multiple markers of primary care access char-
acteristics suggest that timely primary care could prevent
some of these visits.

ental health (MH) conditions are an important
cause of morbidity in children and youth.1,2 One in
five children have an MH condition, yet less than
20% of affected children receive adequate services.3,4 In North
America, up to 3% of all pediatric emergency department (ED)
visits5-7 and 10% of all hospital admissions are MH related.8
While the overall prevalence of MH conditions in youth has
remained relatively stable,9 the rates of health service use, ED
visits, and hospital admissions are increasing.6,10,11
Up to half of children and youth who present to the ED
have no previous psychiatric history or contact with the MH
care system.12,13 These ED visits for MH-related concerns
without prior MH care contact have been described as “first
contact” ED visits.14 First contact ED visits have been used as
a health system performance indicator measuring access to
MH care.14 Although emergency services are important for
managing MH crises, the rise in ED visits observed in children
and youth and the high rate of first contact suggests that ac-
cess to timely outpatient MH care is an important issue.10,14 In
adults, individuals with first-contact ED visits for psychosis
have poor clinical outcomes, such as more severe disease at
presentation and higher future use of acute-care services,15 but
less is known about the phenomenon of first contact ED visits
in youth and for other MH problems. First contact may be due
to a failure by families to recognize MH conditions before
crisis,12,16 parental request for urgent or timely diagnostic
evaluation,12 lack of access or knowledge about how to access
services, reluctance to discuss concerns with a primary care
physician,17 or reduced proficiency in English.18 Ethnicity and
socioeconomic status are associated with increased use of ED
services for MH conditions,4,5,19-21 but it is unclear whether
these are also risk factors for first contact. Finally, certain MH
conditions may present acutely (e.g., alcohol intoxication), and
first contact may be unavoidable.
Elucidating risk factors for first contact ED visits in
children and youth is important to understand whether EDs
are being used for MH problems due to
outpatient access issues and to better align
emergency services with need. Therefore,
the aims of this study are to describe
demographic, clinical, and primary care
provider characteristics of children and
youth with first-time ED visits for MH

 problems, and to test the associations of these characteristics
with whether there was previous outpatient care for MH
problems in a population-based cross-sectional study from
Ontario, whose population of 13 million represents 40% of the
Canadian population.
METHOD
Study Design and Setting
This was a population-based, cross-sectional study of a cohort of
youth presenting to an ED in Ontario, Canada, using data available
through a research agreement with the Ontario Ministry of Health
and Long-Term Care and the Institute for Clinical Evaluative
Sciences (ICES). In Ontario, most hospital and physician services are
funded through the single payer Ontario Health Insurance Plan
(OHIP). Research ethics board approval was obtained from The
Hospital for Sick Children and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre
in Toronto, Ontario.
Data Sources
A number of linked health administrative and demographic datasets
available at ICES were used for study data. ICES data holdings link
individual patient records from health care services including ED
visits, inpatient hospitalizations, and outpatient visits using encoded
identifiers. The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System
(NACRS) was used to identify MH-related ED visits according to
discharge diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] 10th
Revision codes).22 The Canadian Institute for Health Information
Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI–DAD) and the Ontario Mental
Health Reporting System (for designated mental health hospital
beds) were used to evaluate clinical information for patients with
MH-related hospital admissions.23 The OHIP claims database con-
tains information on outpatient billings by physicians in Ontario and
was used to determine MH-related outpatient visits, primary care
use, and provider characteristics. The Client Agency Program
Enrolment (CAPE) database was used to describe patient enrollment
with primary care groups and patient enrollment models. The ICES
Physician Database (IPDB) provided information about physician
characteristics.
The Ontario Registered Persons Database (RPDB) was used to
identify postal code of residence, which was linked to 2006 Cana-
dian Census data to obtain neighborhood income quintile data at the
level of a dissemination area (400�700 persons). The Ontario portion
of the federally maintained Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship
Canada’s Permanent Resident Data System (PRDS) was used to
characterize those who were immigrants and refugees up until
March 31, 2012. All patient data are deterministically linked by an
encoded health insurance number. Probabilistic linkage of the
immigrant dataset and the RPDB is 86% and has been described in
detail elsewhere.24
Study Population
The study included all youth 10 to 24 years of age who were living
in Ontario and who had an unscheduled incident ED visit for an
MH condition (ICD-10 codes F04-F99, X60-84, Y10-Y19 or Y28)
from April 1, 2010, to March 31, 2014. An incident ED visit was
defined as an ED visit for an MH disorder without a prior MH-
related ED visit or hospitalization in the 2 preceding years. This
exclusion was made to restrict our population to those with a first
or new emergency MH crisis. Duplicated, overlapping, and trans-
ferred ED visits were excluded. Records of non-Ontario residents,
or those with a missing or invalid health card number, age, or sex
were excluded. Children and youth whose primary care is deliv-
ered in a community health centre for which there are no admin-
istrative records of visits available, those with less than 2 years of
OHIP eligibility prior to the index event, and those whose usual
provider of primary care (UPC) speciality was missing were also
excluded.
Outcome
The primary outcome was a mental health ED visit without prior
outpatient physician care for MH problems (“first contact visit”),
operationalized as one or more outpatient visits for an MH-related
disorder to a primary care provider (i.e., general practitioner/
family physician [GP/FP], or pediatrician) or any visit to a psy-
chiatrist in the 2 years preceding the incident ED visit. We used an
algorithm to define MH visits that was validated in adults and
modified for children.25 The algorithm uses physician billing data
to define an MH visit as an outpatient visit claim with an MH
diagnostic code.
Predictors
A number of variables that, based on the literature or clinical
plausibility, are potentially associated with MH disorders or access
to MH care were included. Age, sex, socioeconomic status (neigh-
borhood income quintiles), and rural residence were included as
covariates, given their known association with access to MH care.1,11
The Rurality Index of Ontario (RIO) score was used to determine
whether patients lived in urban (RIO <39) or rural (RIO �40)
areas.26 Mental health morbidity and service use vary by immigra-
tion status1,27 and were assessed using two main variables: immi-
gration
status
(nonimmigrant,
immigrant
nonrefugee,
and
immigrant refugee); and time since arriving in Canada, defined as
number of years from landing in Canada to incident ED visit
(recent ¼ 0 to �5 years, intermediate ¼ >5 years and �10 years, and
long-term ¼ >10 years).28,29
All-cause ED visits has been used as a marker of overall adult
health needs,30 whereas all low-acuity ED visits, or the tendency to
use emergency services for less urgent causes, has been shown to
reflect primary care access.31 Both all-cause ED visits and all low-
acuity ED visits for children and youth in the 2 years prior to the
incident ED visit were measured and categorized as none, 1, 2, or �3
ED visits. To determine the frequency of outpatient primary care
health service use before first contact, visits to a primary care pro-
vider in the 2 years before the ED visit were assessed and divided
into tertiles. For youth with a prior outpatient MH visit, the number
of visits to a psychiatrist in the 2 years before the ED visit was
described.
In Ontario, significant reform to primary care delivery has
occurred with the creation of several primary care models32 to
improve patient access with financial incentives to provide after-
hours care.33 Those GP/FPs who are not enrolled in a model are
remunerated by fee-for-service (FFS). Pediatricians provide some
primary care but have not been included in primary care reform;
they are remunerated by FFS and have no requirement to provide
after-hours care. The primary care reform did not include behavioral
health integration or specific MH-focused initiatives, although some
practices may have chosen to use additional available funding to
invest in MH services such as those from a social worker. UPC was
assigned, as in previous work,34 in the following manner. Those
rostered in a primary care model were assigned to that provider. For
nonrostered individuals, an algorithm using all primary care billings
for the preceding 2 years was used to assign the physician with the
highest dollar value of primary care billings for each patient. For

 nonrostered youth, those with no primary care use were considered
to have no UPC. We categorized each assigned UPC as GP/FP
model, GP/FP no model, pediatrician, or no UPC. We hypothesized
that patients rostered in primary care models would have better
access to MH care.
Characteristics of the assigned UPC, including age, sex, type of
physician (GP/FP or pediatrician), years in practice, foreign-trained,
full-time/part-time designation, rurality of practice, and practice-
level MH volume were included. Mental health volume was
determined based on the average annualized volume of distinct
outpatient MH-related visits per calendar year for youth 10 to 24
years of age for the number of years that the physician has been in
practice; tertiles were used to create categories. We hypothesized
that physicians with more activity in MH might be more experi-
enced at identifying MH problems.
Based on the ED record, MH disorders were categorized as fol-
lows: 1) acute stress disorder; 2) anxiety; 3) eating disorders;
4) mood/affective disorder; 5) substance-related disorders; 6) self-
harm; 7) schizophrenia, delusional, and nonorganic psychotic
disorders; 8) selected childhood disorders (e.g., autism spectrum
disorder); 9) selected personality and behavior disorders; and 10)
other MH-related disorders (see Supplement 1 and Table S1, avail-
able online, for mutually exclusive ICD-10 codes used). All visits
were assigned a Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) score, a
standardized measure assigned when ED patients are triaged,
categorized as low (CTAS score 4 or 5) or high acuity (CTAS score 1,
2, or 3).35
The ED visit time and day of the week were used to explore the
impact of availability of outpatient services (e.g., after-hours clinic).
Visits were categorized based on multiple services likely available
(08:01�16:00 Monday�Friday), few services available (16:01�24:00
Monday�Friday, or 08:01�16:00 Saturday/Sunday), or ED as main
place to seek care (00:01�08:00 Tuesday�Saturday, or 16:01�08:00
Saturday/Sunday). Similarly, ED visits were categorized by week-
day or weekend/statutory holiday (defined by the Ontario Ministry
of Labour).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the study cohort,
using proportions for categorical data and median or mean
with standard deviation for continuous data. Differences between
groups were assessed using the c2 test for categorical data and
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous data.
Poisson modeling using robust error variances and a priori-selected
covariates variables were used to determine predictors of first con-
tact ED visits. Table S2, available online, summarizes how missing
data were handled. To explore characteristics of primary care pro-
viders associated with first contact, we performed a subgroup
analysis including only those patients with a usual provider of
primary care. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by stratifying the
results by only those children and youth admitted to the hospital, to
ensure robustness of findings and relevance to more acutely ill
youth. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs are reported. All analyses were
conducted in SAS Enterprise guide version 6.1 (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Following exclusions (Figure 1), we included 118,851 youth
with a first-time ED visit for an MH problem between 2010
and 2014, of whom 16,666 (14.0%) were hospitalized and 40
died in the ED. Most visits were due to substance-related
disorders
(26.6%),
anxiety
(20.4%),
mood/affective
disorders (18.2%), and acute stress disorder (14.4%). We
present the overall cohort by admission status in Table S3,
available online, for descriptive purposes only, as those
individuals who were admitted may represent a somewhat
different clinical population. Only a small proportion of
youth with an ED visit for substance-related disorders
(2.7%) and anxiety (2.4%) were admitted to hospital,
whereas 70.1% of youth who presented with schizophrenia,
delusional
disorders,
and
psychotic
disorders
were
hospitalized.
More than half (53.5%) of youth had no prior outpatient
MH care (Table 1). The ED visits for those with no prior MH
care were more likely to be for substance-related disorders
(34.3% vs 17.8%) but less likely for mood/affective (13.5% vs
23.6%) and selected childhood disorders (0.9% vs 3.4%). In
the 2 years preceding first contact, youth had an average of
4.2 primary care visits compared to 10.4 visits in those with
prior MH care; 30.9% of youth with prior outpatient MH
care had one or more visits to a psychiatrist. Of patients
admitted from the ED for MH care, 41.2% had never pre-
viously seen an outpatient provider.
The adjusted RRs of first contact ED visits for MH-related
disorders are shown in Table 2. Compared with non-
immigrants,
refugee
immigrants
(RR
¼
1.17,
95%
CI ¼ 1.13�1.21) and nonrefugee immigrants (RR ¼ 1.10, 95%
CI ¼ 1.08�1.13) had a greater risk of first contact. As
neighborhood income quintile decreased, the risk of first
contact increased (lowest versus highest income quintile;
RR ¼ 1.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.03�1.06). Children and youth without
a UPC were significantly more likely to have a first contact
ED visit (no UPC versus GP/FP model; RR ¼ 1.78, 95%
CI ¼ 1.77�1.80).

 increased risk of first contact, including foreign training,
rurality, male sex, and working full-time (Table 3). Provider
MH practice volume had a dose�response effect, with lower
MH volume associated with higher risk of first contact.
Youth with a UPC remunerated by FFS, in other words, not
part of a primary care reform model, had a 10% greater risk
of first contact ED visits.
When the analysis was stratified by age group, most
findings were similar to the overall cohort (Table S4, avail-
able online). In the 10- to 17-year age group, males had a
lower risk of first contact, whereas in the 18- to 24-year age
group, the risk was elevated. Neighborhood income quintile
was not associated with increased risk of first contact in the
10- to 17-year age group, whereas it was significant in older
youth. When the analysis was restricted to youth admitted
to hospital, most findings were similar to those discharged
from ED. The risk of no prior outpatient MH care for youth
from the lowest neighborhood income quintile was even
greater.
DISCUSSION
In this large, population-based study, we report that more
than half of children and youth who presented to the ED
with a new MH condition had not previously sought MH
care in an outpatient setting. Although there was a diverse
range of MH diagnoses, 81% of visits were due to anxiety,
adjustment, mood/affective, and substance-related disor-
ders. Given that most first contact literature on MH condi-
tions focuses on adults with psychotic disorders15,36 or
children and youth referred to mental health services,37 our
study fills an important gap.
We identified several risk factors for first contact mental
health ED visits. Consistent with prior research on poverty
and poor access to MH care,20 youth from the most
deprived neighborhoods were more likely to have first
contact in an ED. Youth living in rural regions were also
less likely to receive outpatient care before first ED contact.
These data support qualitative research that reported that
rural adolescents may delay seeking help for MH problems
due to concerns of gossip, perceived social proximity, and
limited availability of resources.38 Youth with prior low-
acuity ED visits were more likely to have first contact ED
visits potentially due to a tendency to use emergency ser-
vices for less urgent causes,31,39 or this may reflect primary
care access issues. Refugees and nonrefugee immigrants
were also more likely to have first contact visits compared
to nonimmigrants. First contact may be due to poor (actual
or perceived) primary care access, reduced proficiency in
English, stigma, inability to navigate the health care
system, or a higher acuity of illness.12,16,18 Given that
immigrants make up 20% of the population,40 our findings
highlight a high-risk group that may require targeted
interventions.
It is not surprising that most youth with substance-
related disorders (some of which may be a first-time
acute intoxication) have no prior outpatient MH care, yet
43% of visits for schizophrenia, delusional, and psychotic
disorders were also first contact. Although some ED visits
are likely unavoidable and are related to the speed of onset
(i.e.,
episode
of
severe
intoxication),
others
are
not
(e.g., newly diagnosed schizophrenia, adjustment, and
anxiety disorders), and treatment should be initiated early
in ambulatory settings. Indeed, two-thirds of children with
substance-related
disorders
were
first
contact
visits,
whereas less than one-fourth of more slowly developing
disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, were first
contact.
Most first contact ED visits were triaged as high acuity
and likely appropriate for an emergency care venue, but
mild MH problems in some youth may have evolved into
severe crises due to poor primary care access or clinician
difficulty in recognizing MH symptoms.41 Indeed, we
found that youth with a primary care physician whose
practice had a relatively higher volume of MH visits and
who participate in a capitation-based primary care model

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AS A FIRST CONTACT FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS
 that required after-hours access to primary care33 had lower
first contact ED visits. The clear temporal pattern of first-
contact ED use (76% of visits occur after 16:00 on week-
days and on weekends/holidays), similar to findings in
other studies,21 also suggests that access to primary care
may play a role.
One striking finding in our study was the large number of
primary care visits for any reason in youth with prior
outpatient MH care (10.4 compared with 4.2 visits in the
2 years before the ED visit). Given that only 31% of children
were seeing a psychiatrist, this highlights the major and
underrecognized role of primary care in managing MH
problems. The key role of primary care in the pathway to first
diagnosis was also found in an Australian study in adults in
which 53% of patients saw a GP before receiving specialist
MH care.36 However, children and youth with first contact ED
visits are accessing primary care for non�MH-related prob-
lems, which may represent a missed opportunity. Further
research is needed on potential screening mechanisms42 to
identify specific MH problems earlier.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate
children and youth who first present to the ED with any
MH-related condition. Unlike other studies,12,13,43,44 we
minimized selection bias by including all MH diagnoses
across a range of hospitals in a universal access health care
system. Although administrative datasets provide insights
into a large population of patients, they have inherent limi-
tations, including potential coding errors and a lack of data
on contributing factors (e.g., substance use), education
levels, and use of nonphysician community MH services
(e.g., psychologists and social workers). We did not deter-
mine whether the prior outpatient visit was for the same MH
condition as the first contact ED visit, nor did we determine
the timing of the prior outpatient visit in relation to the
incident ED visit.
Using the ED as a first point of contact for MH services is
increasingly being identified as a health system quality
indicator.1 Our study suggests that high rates of first contact
reflect poor access to timely MH care, much of which would
be delivered by primary care providers. Although the ED
plays an important role in crisis management, the priority is
stabilization rather than rehabilitation, and referrals to
community resources are often deferred to primary care.12
We identified several risk factors associated with first con-
tact that have important implications for clinicians and
policy makers. For more than half of youth who present to
the ED, emergency clinicians should ensure that appropriate
follow-up is arranged. However, health care system strate-
gies to improve access to appropriate primary care and

Clinical Guidance
� More than half of children and youth who present to the
emergency department (ED) with a mental health (MH)
condition have not previously received outpatient
physician care for MH problems.
� Many of these ED visits occur after hours, but ED staff need
to have systems to ensure timely and adequate follow-up,
especially given how many are the first presentation for
MH problems.
� Children and youth at greatest risk for no previous MH
care include those from rural areas, low-income neigh-
borhoods, or immigrant families.
� Children and youth whose primary care providers have
more of a focus on MH or who are mandated to provide
after-hours access are more likely to have previously sought
outpatient care for MH problems before presenting to
the ED.
