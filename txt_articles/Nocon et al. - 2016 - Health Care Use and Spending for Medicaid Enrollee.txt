Abstract
Objectives—To compare health care use and spending of Medicaid enrollees seen at federally 
qualified health centers versus non–health center settings in a context of significant growth.
Methods—Using fee-for-service Medicaid claims from 13 states in 2009, we compared patients 
receiving the majority of their primary care in federally qualified health centers with propensity 
score–matched comparison groups receiving primary care in other settings.
Results—We found that health center patients had lower use and spending than did non–health 
center patients across all services, with 22% fewer visits and 33% lower spending on specialty 
care and 25% fewer admissions and 27% lower spending on inpatient care. Total spending was 
24% lower for health center patients.

 Conclusions—Our analysis of 2009 Medicaid claims, which includes the largest sample of 
states and more recent data than do previous multistate claims studies, demonstrates that the health 
center program has provided a cost-efficient setting for primary care for Medicaid enrollees.
A central pillar of the Affordable Care Act (ACA; Pub L No. 111–148) is the expansion of 
the Medicaid program to include adults younger than 65 years with incomes up to 133% of 
the federal poverty level. Roughly half of states have formally expanded their Medicaid 
programs, and even nonexpansion states have seen increased enrollment stemming from 
greater public awareness and streamlined enrollment processes.1 Medicaid expansion has 
raised concerns about the financial sustainability of the program and the availability of 
health care providers to see the newly insured.2 To improve access to care for the medically 
underserved, including the newly insured, the ACA also called for $11 billion in funding for 
federally qualified health centers.3,4
Federally qualified health centers receive grants under Section 330 of the US Public Health 
Service Act and currently provide comprehensive primary care to roughly 23 million 
patients5 in medically needy areas and roughly 1 out of 7 Medicaid enrollees.6 For brevity, 
we will use the term “health center” throughout this article to refer to these federally 
qualified health centers. Health centers are required to provide nonclinical enabling services 
that support access to primary care, such as case management and transportation. Health 
centers are required to be located in, or provide services to, medically underserved 
communities, and they are required to have more than half of their governing board be health 
center patients that represent the population served. Because of the likelihood of an 
expanded role for health centers in the Medicaid program and ongoing concerns regarding 
the costs of the program, it is critical to understand whether the setting of primary care for 
Medicaid recipients has any association with health service utilization and spending.
The design and requirements of the health center program may be particularly well suited to 
the complex social and primary care needs of Medicaid patients. For example, the enabling 
services provided by health centers may result in physical and mental health issues being 
addressed earlier and in a more coordinated manner, resulting in lower health care use and 
spending for other services. Although the conceptual underpinnings of the program are clear, 
the empirical evidence regarding the impact of health center care on use and spending has 
been conflicting. Previous studies of Medicaid enrollees receiving primary care in health 
centers have found some associations with lower health care use. A study of 2008 Colorado 
Medicaid data found health center use to be associated with lower likelihoods of emergency 
department (ED) visit, inpatient hospitalization, 90-day readmission, and preventable 
hospitalization.7
Two multistate Medicaid claims studies (a 4-state study using 1994–1995 data and a 5-state 
study of 1992 data) found health center use to be associated with fewer preventable ED 
visits and hospitalizations.8,9 By contrast, other studies have found that health center care 
was associated with higher use and spending. A 3-state study of 2003–2004 Medicaid claims 
found greater outpatient and total spending for health center patients compared with 
physician office care,10 and a study of 2004–2008 data from a national survey of adults 
included a subgroup analysis of Medicaid patients that found health center care to be

 associated with more ED visits than is non–health center care.11 Overall, the literature on 
this topic is limited by analyses that capture varying or incomplete utilization and spending 
outcomes, study a small number of states, use older data that may not reflect current practice 
patterns, or use limited methods for adjusting for differences in health center and non–health 
center patient populations.
We compared utilization and spending between health center and non–health center 
Medicaid enrollees using data from a large number of US states, which can provide 
important insight because of the variability in Medicaid programs across states. We also 
examined a broader set of health care services than have previous studies, including primary 
care, other outpatient care, prescription drugs, ED use, and inpatient care. Finally, we 
compared health center and non–health center patients with a propensity score–matching 
approach, which can provide a more robust adjustment for observed differences between 
health center and non–health center patients.
Although our use of 2009 data does not allow us to analyze the effect of ACA Medicaid 
expansions that began in 2014, post-ACA claims are not yet available for this data set. Our 
data year allows us to examine a larger number of Medicaid patients and states than do more 
recent years. In more recent years of Medicaid claims, the increasing prevalence of Medicaid 
managed care inhibits cross-plan and cross-state comparison, because these claims do not 
contain service-level expenditures and vary in data quality across states.
METHODS
We examined the cross-sectional association between primary care setting and a set of 
utilization and spending outcomes among fee-for-service Medicaid enrollees in 13 states in 
2009. The 13 states in our analysis were Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, 
Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Vermont, Texas, and West 
Virginia (Table 1). We emphasized the following factors when choosing states to include in 
the analysis: geographic diversity, variation in size, presence of a large number of health 
centers and health center Medicaid patients, likelihood of claims data being available in a 
timely manner, and high prevalence of fee-for-service Medicaid claims. The number of 
states we included was limited by our funds available for data purchase.
Data Collection
We obtained claims from the Medicaid Analytic eXtract files. We constructed an analytic 
data set from Medicaid Analytic eXtract files that focused on adult, nonelderly (aged 18–65 
years), fee-for-service users of ambulatory primary care services. We excluded all dental, 
transportation, and long-term care claims from our analysis. Because claims data for 
utilization and spending data may not be reliable for Medicaid managed care patients, we 
excluded all claims in months of data when an enrollee was in a medical managed care 
program. We also excluded single months of fee-for-service data that fell between 2 months 
of managed care enrollment. Other notable exclusions were patients with restricted benefits 
anytime during the year, those who delivered a baby during the year, and those who had 
changing eligibility over the year. (A full listing and description of exclusions are available 
as a supplement to the online version of this article at http://www. ajph.org.)

 We examined use or spending for primary care, other (nonprimary) outpatient care, 
prescription drugs, ED care, inpatient care, and total health care spending, which represents 
the sum of the previously listed spending categories. Spending for each type of utilization 
represented the sum of total payments from Medicaid and third-party payers. Our spending 
variable did not include federal support to health centers that occurs outside the context of 
the Medicaid fee-for-service visit, such as federally backed loan guarantees for capital 
improvement projects and the ability to forgo purchase of private malpractice insurance 
because the federal government assumes responsibility for malpractice settlement and 
judgment costs.12
Our main independent variable of interest was the type of primary care setting. We 
categorized patients as either health center or non–health center patients on the basis of 
whether more than half of their primary care visits occurred in a health center. We also 
conducted analyses dividing non–health center patients into 3 subgroups: physician office 
patients, hospital outpatients, and mixed use patients, where the mixed use category 
comprised those who did not have a majority of primary care visits in any 1 setting. To 
determine primary care setting, we used the national provider identifier, claim type, and 
place of service in each claim. We created a listing of health center identifiers from Health 
Resources and Services Administration databases and Medicare and Medicaid cost reports 
and linked that information to the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System.13
Our adjusted analyses included covariates to account for factors that influenced health care 
utilization and spending. Covariates were patient demographics (age, race/ethnicity, gender), 
insurance characteristics (eligibility category, months of eligibility, Temporary Aid for 
Needy Families program indicator), disease burden, and US state. For disease burden, we 
used the Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System for Medicaid with the Medicaid Rx 
model and created binary variables for each category of diagnosis (e.g., cardiovascular, low) 
and medication group (e.g., diabetes) included in sufficient volume in our study sample.14,15
One barrier to adjustment in health center analyses is that Medicaid generally pays health 
centers on a per-visit (vs fee-for-service) basis. Although health centers are required to use 
diagnosis codes for billing and quality reporting, the lack of service-level (as opposed to 
encounter-level) claims may lead to health centers applying a lower volume of diagnosis 
codes and the potential for underdetection of disease burden for health center patients when 
using claims-based risk adjustment. Our adjustment claims across all service types 
(inpatient, nonprimary care outpatient, and prescription drugs) to characterize disease 
severity. We also controlled for 2 geographic variables: residing in a metropolitan statistical 
area16 and the distance from where the patient lived (using the centroid of the residence zip 
code)17 to the closest health center delivery site.
Statistical Analyses
We conducted basic descriptive analyses of patient characteristics, utilization, and spending 
by assigned primary care setting. Because the characteristics of health center patients are 
unlike those of patients seen in other settings, we used propensity score methods to balance 
potential observed confounders. 18 The propensity score–matching method is a technique for 
selecting non–health center users who are matched with health center users on potentially

 confounding covariates. This matching approach results in groups that are comparable on 
the basis of the covariates, regardless of correct model specification of outcomes and 
covariates, which is required in the standard generalized linear model.
We estimated propensity scores using a logistic regression model in which receiving 
treatment in a health center is predicted by the covariates we have described. We matched 
health center patients and non–health center patients with replacement using the nearest 
neighbor matching method. We then developed a series of generalized linear models to 
assess the effect of primary care setting on utilization and expense outcomes on the matched 
sample. We used a log link, assuming negative binomial distribution for utilization and γ-
distribution for expenses. (Further details on the propensity score match and statistical 
models are available as a supplement to the online version of this article at http://
www.ajph.org.)
We expressed our results in terms of the estimated mean of utilization or spending for each 
primary care setting and percentage difference in utilization or spending associated with the 
health center primary care setting relative to the non–health center comparison group. We 
conducted a main analysis with all states pooled, comparing health center to non–health 
center patients. In secondary analyses, we compared health center patients to physician 
office, hospital outpatients, and mixed use patients separately. Because Medicaid programs 
may vary significantly by state, we also performed separate state-by-state analyses. We 
conducted sensitivity analysis of a range of subgroup populations, including disabled 
beneficiaries and recipients of Temporary Aid for Needy Families benefits (not shown). We 
considered results to be statistically significant using a threshold of P <.005 on the basis of 
the Bonferroni method of correction for multiple comparisons.19 We carried out all analyses 
with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All reported P values are 2-sided.
RESULTS
Our final analyses included 144 076 health center Medicaid patients and 894 898 non–health 
center patients (Table 1). Roughly two thirds of patients were female, and they had an 
average age of 41 years. Most patients were from racial/ethnic minority groups. On an 
unadjusted basis, health center patients had lower levels of utilization and expense across all 
service types.
Before propensity score matching, health center and non–health center users differed 
substantially across several covariates, including state, Medicaid eligibility category, 
distance from the nearest health center site, and disease burden. After matching, observed 
confounders were balanced (data available as a supplement to the online version of this 
article at http://www.ajph.org).
When compared with non–health center patients, patients receiving most of their primary 
care in health centers experienced lower utilization and spending for all services examined 
(Table 2). The largest differences were in other outpatient visits (15.7 vs 12.2; −22% 
difference; CI= −21%, −24%) and spending ($2948 vs $1964; −33% difference; CI = −32%, 
−35%) as well as inpatient admissions (0.25 vs 0.19; −25% difference; CI = −22%, −27%)

 and spending ($2047 vs $1496; −27% difference; CI = −24%, −30%). Total spending was 
lower for health center patients ($9889 vs $7518; −24% difference; CI = −23%, −25%). 
Differences in ED services were smaller in magnitude, although health center patients still 
had lower ED use (1.3 vs 1.2 visits; −11% difference; CI= −10%, −13%) and spending 
($244 vs $216; −11% difference; CI = −10%, −13%).
When compared with the physician office, hospital outpatient, and mixed use groups (Table 
3), the pattern of consistently lower use and spending for all services held for health center 
patients in comparison with hospital outpatients and mixed use patients. When compared 
with physician office patients, there was no difference in primary care use for health center 
patients, and health center patients had higher primary care spending ($1184 vs $1430; 21% 
difference; CI= 18%, 24%), more ED visits (1.0 vs 1.2; 16% difference; CI = 14%, 18%), 
and more ED spending ($186 vs $216; 16% difference; CI = 13%, 18%). Health center 
patients had lower use and spending across other services and lower total spending.
When comparing health center patients to non–health center patients in each of the 13 study 
states, we found trends in findings that were generally consistent across states (Table 4). 
Total spending was lower for health center patients across all 13 states. In 3 states 
(Connecticut, Illinois, and Texas), health center patients had higher primary care use or 
spending, and in Illinois, health center patients had higher ED use.
DISCUSSION
In this study of fee-for-service adult Medicaid enrollees across 13 states, we found that 
patients who received the majority of their primary care in health centers had lower total 
health care use and spending than did matched patients who receive primary care in other 
settings. The finding of lower total spending for health center patients was robust across all 
primary care comparison settings and states that we examined.
When comparing the full range of outcomes across states, we found that most states had the 
same patterns as our main analyses that pooled all states. The general consistency of these 
findings suggests that there may be a distinct association between health center primary care 
setting and health care use and spending because each state administers the Medicaid 
program independently, with variation in financing, management, and care programs. Some 
individual states did have results that varied from the trend observed when all states were 
pooled. Connecticut, Illinois, and Texas had higher primary care use or spending for health 
center patients, and Illinois had higher ED use for non–health center patients.
When examining different forms of non–health center primary care settings (physician 
office, hospital outpatient, and mixed use), we found that most of our main findings held, 
except that health center patients had more primary care spending and ED use and spending 
than did physician office patients.
One potential interpretation of our results is that if health centers provide comparable or 
higher levels of quality, lower spending may mean that they are an efficient form of primary 
care. Two other recent studies of health center primary care have used data from the Medical 
Expenditure Panel Survey11 and Medicare claims,20 and they similarly found lower overall

 health care use or spending for health center patients. With respect to quality of care, short-
term studies (most often 1–2 years) using administrative or survey data have generally found 
process-based measures of quality to be comparable or higher among health centers for 
similar patient populations. 11,21,22 Studies using ecologic designs have also demonstrated 
that the establishment or expansion of health centers in an area is associated with long-term 
declines in mortality. 23,24 Recent high-profile studies of Medicaid have brought intense 
controversy over the cost of the program.25 States that are considering expansion of their 
Medicaid programs are engaged in discussions of how to manage health care spending for 
newly insured patients. If our observation of lower use and cost among health center patients 
is owing to health centers providing a more efficient form of primary care, then health center 
program growth may provide an avenue for expanding Medicaid in a cost-efficient manner.
A second interpretation is that the patterns of utilization and cost reflect characteristics of 
the health care network accessed by health center patients—as opposed to aspects of care 
within the health center. If health center providers tend to refer patients to other care settings 
that have lower use rates or lower spending (because of access or practice patterns), the 
nature of those referral networks may lead to the observed differences in use and spending. 
Although utilization of lower cost specialty and inpatient care networks may be a desirable 
outcome, policymakers and Medicaid administrators must ensure that it does not limit access 
to high-quality care. For example, in a recent national survey of health centers conducted in 
2009 and 2013, health center leaders reported increasing difficulty obtaining specialty or 
subspecialty appointments for their Medicaid patients.26
A third interpretation is that health center patients may be different from those in physician 
offices and hospital outpatient practices in ways that we are unable to account for with our 
data. Our propensity score–matching techniques adjust for confounding stemming from 
factors such as patient demographics, type of Medicaid insurance, and the disease burden 
observed in our data. However, we are unable to control for potential confounding because 
of factors that are not observed in our data set, and we are unaware of any studies that 
identify factors that drive Medicaid patients’ choice of health centers for primary care. In 
particular, administrative claims data provide limited insight into important patient 
characteristics that may influence utilization and spending, such as healthy behaviors and 
lifestyle.
If our findings are driven by health center Medicaid patients being systematically healthier 
in ways not observable in claims data, this would highlight the importance of ongoing work 
to improve measurements of health and incorporate them into risk adjustment and payment 
schemes.27,28 Health centers have long been known for serving vulnerable populations with 
high chronic disease burdens and health care needs. As health centers increasingly 
participate in accountable care organizations and shared savings arrangements with payers, it 
will be important for health centers and other providers to thoroughly document the health 
needs of their patients and communicate that information in a clear and compelling manner 
to payers and policymakers.
Other limitations in the scope of our analysis are also important to note. Our cross-sectional 
study cannot provide evidence of a causal relationship between health center care and health

 care use and spending. Although our study includes a large number of patients across several 
states, our study sample excludes important groups of enrollees (e.g., Medicaid managed 
care enrollees, Medicaid–Medicare dual eligible enrollees, long-term care recipients, and 
children), which limits the generalizability of findings across the Medicaid program. In 
particular, because Medicaid managed care has grown to become the dominant mode of 
administration for the Medicaid programs, ongoing study of the association between primary 
care setting and health care spending in the context of managed care is important.
We examined only Medicaid utilization and spending; we did not assess quality of care and 
cannot make conclusions about cost effectiveness or overall costs from a societal 
perspective. For example, health centers receive some federal financial support outside the 
scope of Medicaid fee-for-service payment, and some programs (such as the 340b drug 
pricing program, which is prevalent among health centers)29 may lower Medicaid spending 
for health center patients. Health centers also receive federally supported technical 
assistance on quality improvement as well as federal grant funding outside Medicaid 
payments that we are unable to account for in our analyses. In addition, we cannot account 
for the unobserved heterogeneity across patients of different settings that is not captured 
with propensity score adjustment. Finally, although we classified settings of primary care 
into health center, hospital outpatient, and physician offices, it is important to acknowledge 
the wide variation in organizational structure and practices within these settings. Future 
work should analyze the role of organizational characteristics in the relationship between 
primary care setting and utilization, cost, and quality of care.
Cost reduction will continue to play an important role in ongoing efforts to improve the US 
health care system. Our analyses showed that Medicaid patients who obtain primary care at 
health centers had lower use and spending than did similar patients in other primary care 
settings. Although we hypothesize several potential causes for this association, future studies 
should work to empirically identify the mechanisms at work that lead to the compelling 
utilization and cost differences found in this study. As more Medicaid data become available 
for the years after the implementation of the ACA, it will also be critical to examine whether 
the associations we observed differ for more recent cohorts.

which was estimated using a logistic regression adjusting for patient demographics (age, race/ethnicity, gender), insurance characteristics 
(Medicaid eligibility category, months of eligibility, Temporary Aid for Needy Families program beneficiary indicator), disease burden (on the 
basis of binary disease diagnosis variables from the Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System), state, residence in a metropolitan statistical

Note. CI = confidence interval. “No estimate” means that models for that outcome did not converge and no estimate was reached. Primary care setting was determined by where >50% of primary care visits occur. Use and spending is expressed in annual values per patient. Each 
health center patient was matched with 1 non–health center patient on the basis of the logit of propensity score, which was estimated using a logistic regression adjusting for patient demographics (age, race/ethnicity, gender), insurance characteristics (Medicaid eligibility 
category, months of eligibility, Temporary Aid for Needy Families program beneficiary indicator), disease burden (determined by binary disease diagnosis variables from the Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System), state, residence in a metropolitan statistical area, and 
distance from the closest health center delivery site. The negative percentage difference reflects lower health center utilization or spending.
aOther outpatient care is defined as all nonprimary care, nontransportation, and nondental outpatient claims activity.
