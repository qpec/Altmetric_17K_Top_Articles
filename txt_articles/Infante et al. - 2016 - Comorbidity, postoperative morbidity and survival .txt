 Comorbidity, postoperative morbidity and survival in patients
undergoing radical surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma†
Abstract
OBJECTIVES: We examined a series of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) patients who underwent radical surgery to explore
relationships among comorbidity, postoperative morbidity and survival.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out of all MPM patients operated on in a single centre from 2000 to 2015. The Charlson
Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to classify patients according to their underlying condition. Postoperative complications were scored
according to WHO-derived criteria. Survival comparisons were performed by Cox analysis.
RESULTS: Ninety-one patients underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP), 47 underwent pleurectomy decortication (PD) and 25
underwent palliative pleurectomy. The mean CCI of PD patients was significantly higher compared with that of EPP patients (P = 0.044).
The frequency of grade 3+ complications was similar between EPP and PD (27 vs 26%). However, EPP patients had a 6-fold higher
frequency of pleural sepsis (24 vs 4%, P = 0.002) occurring up to 695 days postoperatively. Median overall survival was 19 months (95%
CI 13–25) after EPP, 30 months (95% CI 20–35) after PD and 13 months (95% CI 5–32) after palliative pleurectomy. At multivariate analysis,
CCI (P < 0.001), histology (P = 0.014) and pleural sepsis (P = 0.001), but not complete resection, were significantly associated with survival.
There was a trend in favour of PD over palliative resection after adjusting for histology and CCI.
CONCLUSIONS: The CCI is an independent predictor of survival in MPM patients undergoing radical surgery. Owing to its significant
frequency and adverse impact, pleural sepsis may contribute to a reduced life expectancy after EPP. Surgical treatment of MPM remains
debatable.

INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly lethal disease
for which effective therapeutic options are lacking.
In theory, surgery when applicable is the only treatment modal-
ity capable of achieving tumour clearance, but unfortunately the
diffuse nature of MPM and unsurmountable anatomical limits
make removal of all cancer with microscopically clear margins
virtually unattainable even with such an extensive procedure as
extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP). In fact, upon careful examin-
ation, microscopically positive margins can be found in 70–100%
of EPP specimens [1, 2].
Trimodality regimens including induction chemotherapy with
platinum and pemetrexed (PEM), radical surgery by EPP and post-
operative radiotherapy (PORT) have been explored to improve
therapeutic results [3–5]. Several reports [6–8] and a recent
meta-analysis [9] suggested equivalent survival outcomes with EPP

 and pleurectomy decortication (PD) that is now gaining wider ac-
ceptance despite being considered less of a ‘radical’ operation.
Reported median survival ranges from 12 to 22 months after
EPP, from 9 to 32 months after PD, and from 7 to 14 months after
a so-called palliative pleurectomy [9, 10], i.e. partial removal of the
parietal pleura with the aim of preventing—or at least delaying—
recurrence of massive pleural effusion [11].
Actually, however, all evidence suggesting a modest benefit of
radical surgery over medical therapy comes from retrospective
studies only, where the effect of case selection may be substantial
[6, 7, 12, 13].
Besides, morbidity and mortality associated with radical surgery
for MPM are considerable even in experienced hands [1, 9, 14, 15],
and recent evidence showed that the quality of residual life may
be severely affected in long-term survivors, especially after EPP.
Sugarbaker et al. [14] reported an overall complication rate of
60.4% in 328 consecutive EPP patients, and complications defined
as severe were observed in at least 22% of them. Rena and
Casadio [16] have measured quality-of-life indexes before and
after surgery and have shown them to be substantially reduced up
to 1 year after EPP; on the contrary, the same indexes had
returned to baseline levels after PD.
For all the reasons mentioned above, debate as to whether any
form of radical surgery can actually benefit MPM patients is still
ongoing, and the therapeutic attitudes of medical professionals
vary from nihilistic to highly aggressive.
In the absence of a proven treatment standard, shared clinical
decision-making regarding whether or not to proceed to radical
surgery should be based on a careful appraisal of each available
option, and of its potential benefits and hazards.
In this study, we have examined in detail a series of mesotheli-
oma patients selected for radical surgery in a high-volume centre,
to assess the relationships among comorbidity burden, post-
operative morbidity and survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
A retrospective review was carried out of all consecutive patients
with MPM referred to the Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy
from 2000 to June 2014 in whom radical surgery was attempted.
This work was carried out with the approval of the Humanitas
Research Hospital Internal Review Board and informed consent
was obtained from every patient.
Pretreatment evaluation included assessment of the patient’s
general status and cardiopulmonary reserve, contrast-enhanced CT
of the chest and abdomen, and FDG-PET scan. Histological diagnosis
was routinely obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.
All cases were reviewed during multidisciplinary team meetings.
Broadly, patients with no evidence of chest wall invasion, medi-
astinal involvement or distant metastasis, epithelial histology, WHO
performance status 0–1 and adequate cardiorespiratory reserve
were considered suitable surgical candidates. Functional selection
criteria for surgery were: predicted postoperative FEV1 >1L or
>40%, and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 45%.
Prior to 2007, induction chemotherapy was rarely administered;
however, since 2007 an induction regimen consisting of cis-platinum
75 mg/m2 and PEM 500 mg/m2 × 3/4 cycles has been consistently
offered to all potential surgical candidates.
Evaluation of response to induction chemotherapy was based
on repeat imaging studies, FDG-PET and ad hoc investigation
by MRI, endosonography or mediastinoscopy according to
m-RECIST criteria [17].
Patients were excluded from surgery if their condition had
deteriorated or disease progression beyond clinical stage III had
occurred after induction.
EPP was the procedure of choice until 2007; it was gradually
replaced by PD over the following 2 years and virtually abandoned
thereafter.
The standard surgical approach was through a posterolateral
thoracotomy in the VI intercostal space.
PD and extended PD always required complete removal of the
visceral pleura from the entire lung surface, including macroscop-
ically normal portions in the fissures down to the pulmonary
artery. Extended PD was carried out in the case of macroscopic
involvement of the pericardium or diaphragm. In such a case,
Gore-Tex or bovine pericardium patch was used for reconstruc-
tion. Macroscopically, normal parts of the diaphragm were spared
as much as possible to facilitate primary reconstruction whenever
possible.
Only mediastinal sampling was carried out after EPP and PD in
the hope of reducing postoperative morbidity. Intrapulmonary
hilar lymph nodes were removed with the EPP specimen, but
were not extensively harvested during PD for the same reason.
Radical surgery was followed by adjuvant PORT by intensity
modulated radiotherapy until 2010 and by volumetric modulated
arc therapy technology thereafter.
Postoperative follow-up was carried out by 3–6 monthly clinical
assessment, CT scans of the chest and ad hoc further testing.
Follow-up data were also obtained by contact with families and
general practitioners, from hospital charts and health registries.
Follow-up closing date was 1 February 2015.
The age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was retro-
spectively calculated from hospital records and used to classify
patients according to their underlying general condition [18], and
postoperative complications were scored according to WHO-
derived criteria [19].
The definition of pleural sepsis included simple pleural empyema
and empyema secondary to a bronchopleural fistula. It was defined
as early -or late occurring sepsis depending on whether it had
manifest within 30 days postoperatively or later on (Supplementary
Table 2).
Statistical methods
Categorical data were described as number and percentage; for
quantitative data median and interquartile range (IQR), median and
range, or mean and standard deviation was used as appropriate.
Proportions between groups were compared by the χ² or Fisher’s
exact test. If necessary, 95% confidence intervals were added.
Owing to low numbers in each IMIG p-stage subcategory, a
group including p-stage 0–I–II was built, and p-stage III and IV
were left as categorical variables. Age and CCI were analysed as
continuous variables.
Time to progression was calculated from the date of surgery to
the date of relapse, and deaths due to treatment complications
were regarded as deaths due to mesothelioma. Survival analysis
was performed by the method of Kaplan–Meier, with observation
times censored to the date of last contact for patients who were
still alive.
Survival comparisons between groups were performed by the
Cox regression method, including in the multivariate model only

 those parameters reaching a value of P ≤ 0.1 in the univariate ana-
lysis. A significance level of 5% (P < 0.05) was adopted for
comparisons. For all analyses, the Stata software (V.13) was used.
RESULTS
From January 2000 to September 2014, 582 MPM patients were
referred to our centre, and 163 (28%) were considered suitable
candidates for surgical management with radical intent (Table 1).
Pretreatment FDG-PET scan was used with 97 patients.
Ninety-one patients underwent EPP, 47 underwent PD (14 PD
and 33 extended PD) and 25 underwent palliative pleurectomy. In
the latter group, the decision to resort only to palliative surgery
was based on intraoperative findings. No macroscopically incom-
plete EPPs and only one macroscopically incomplete PD were
carried out, due to superior vena cava invasion. In only one case
EPP was intentionally performed instead of PD to achieve macro-
scopically complete resection.
The mean age-adjusted CCI of PD patients was significantly
higher compared with that of EPP patients (2.32 ± 1.02 vs
1.90 ± 1.34, P = 0.044).
Any kind of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (either in a
neoadjuvant setting or as an adjuvant therapy) was administered
to 70 (77%) EPP patients, to 45 (96%) PD patients and to 22 (88%)
palliative pleurectomy patients (P = 0.009). A complete trimodality
treatment including induction with platinum agents and PEM,
radical surgery and PORT could be administered more frequently
after PD than after EPP (P < 0.001)
There were 7 cases of grade 2 radiation pneumonia (15%) but
no grade 3 or higher complications after PD-PORT.
Only 20% of the patients had pathologically confirmed stage
I MPM after EPP, and 38% after PD. Five patients (6%) in the EPP
group had stage IV disease due to multiple foci of chest wall inva-
sion that were nonetheless resected, compared with 9 patients
(19%) in the PD group. The number of resected lymph nodes
was higher after EPP (median 17, range 1–51) than after PD 19
(median 7, range 1–20, P < 0.001).
Biphasic histology was found in 10 EPP patients (11%), in 1 PD
patient (2%) and in 5 palliative pleurectomy patients (20%,
P = 0.030). One patient in the EPP group and 1 in the PD group
had no evidence of residual disease after induction treatment.
The frequency of major complications and 30- and 90-day
mortality rates were not significantly different between EPP and
PD; the only relevant difference was in the occurrence of pleural
sepsis (Supplementary Table 1). As in the EPP group, 9 patients
(10%) developed such a complication within 30 days postopera-
tively and in 13 additional cases (14%), it occurred 32–695 days
postoperatively.
The overall rates of pleural sepsis (early + late) were thus 24%
after EPP (22 of 91 patients), 4% after PD (2 of 47) and 4% (1 of 25)
after palliative pleurectomy (P = 0.002). The risk of pleural sepsis
was significantly higher for right-sided EPP (18 cases) than for
left-sided EPP (4 cases, P = 0.001); duration of surgery, use of pros-
thetic material for reconstruction and number of removed lymph
nodes were not significantly associated with pleural sepsis.
Postoperative complications and mortality rates were significantly
lower after palliative pleurectomy (P = 0.004): no postoperative
mortality was observed in the latter group.
The CCI (P = 0.006) and platinum–PEM induction chemother-
apy (P = 0.039) significantly correlated with the risk of severe
(grade 3+) complications.

 As of February 2015, median follow-up for the whole series was
13.1 months (range 0.1–119).
At that time, 26 patients (16.0%) were still alive and disease-free,
13 (8.0%) were alive with disease, 9 (5.5%) were alive, but no infor-
mation was available on their disease status and 115 (70.6%) had
died. Mesothelioma recurrence or progression was the cause of
death in 102 patients (62.6%), 12 (7.4%) patients had died of other
causes and the cause of death was unknown in 1 patient (0.6%).
Median disease-free survival was 11 months (95% CI 9–15) after
EPP and 12 months (95% CI 8–17) after PD. Median overall
survival (OS) was 19 months (95% CI 13–25) for EPP patients,
30 months (95% CI 20–35) for PD patients and 13 months (95% CI
5–32) for palliative pleurectomy patients (Table 2 and Fig. 1B).
At univariate analysis, no prognostic factor was significantly
associated with disease-free survival (Supplementary Table 2).
Age, CCI, grade 3+ complications and pleural sepsis were instead
significantly associated with OS.
At multivariate analysis, only the CCI, histology and pleural
sepsis retained a significant association with OS (Table 3).
Complete resection was not significant in the model. There was a
trend in favour of PD versus palliative pleurectomy (P = 0.050)
after adjusting for histology and comorbidity burden (Fig. 1B),
whereas for EPP there was no significant correlation (P = 0.186).
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to assess comorbidity, postoperative
morbidity and survival in patients undergoing radical surgery for
MPM in a high-volume centre. To classify our patients according
to their baseline status, we used the age-adjusted CCI as this
metric has already been extensively validated in oncology, it can
be obtained in retrospect from clinical charts with sufficient accur-
acy and reproducibility [20], and was previously shown to be an in-
dependent prognostic factor in elderly MPM patients receiving
chemotherapy [21].
To
describe
postoperative
complications,
we
used
the
WHO-based criteria proposed by Seely et al. [19] for thoracic
surgery, and followed our patients for long after discharge to
document delayed treatment-related morbidity.
Our data show the age-adjusted CCI to be an independent
prognostic factor for OS in MPM patients selected for radical
surgery. As expected, the CCI was also a significant risk factor for
postoperative complications. Our data also confirm the already
known independent prognostic value of epithelioid histology.
In the great majority of published series, the postoperative mor-
bidity of MPM surgery has been assessed according to variable cri-
teria, resulting in wide variations of reported complication rates.

 However, in general, lower complication rates and lower mortality
are reported for PD than for EPP, as recently summarized [11].
In our series, postoperative complications and mortality are in
the low range compared with other series, but severe (grade 3+)
complications and treatment-related death occurred with similar
frequency after EPP and PD (Supplementary Table 1). The only
notable exception was pleural sepsis that occurred in 24% of
EPP patients up to 2 years after surgery—a 6-fold higher risk than
after PD.
The frequency of pleural sepsis after EPP varies considerably in
the literature. In several trimodality trials [3–5] and in the STS
mesothelioma database [22], it was only 3–7%. On the other hand,
Lang-Lazdunski [7] observed pleural sepsis in 23% of EPP patients;
in a recent pooled analysis of three high-volume centres [15], the
incidence was 22% (55 of 251 patients) and in a series from the
Mayo clinic [23], it was 30% (22 of 73 patients).
The reasons for these remarkable differences in the literature
may possibly be related to missing information on late-occurring
pleural sepsis, at least in some of those series.
Despite similar overall postoperative morbidity and mortality
rates of EPP and PD, the impact of PD on patients’ general condi-
tion was apparently less severe, as suggested by the fact that 72%
of PD patients were able to complete trimodality treatment,
whereas only 42% of EPP patients were ultimately able to proceed
to radiotherapy after surgery. The lower percentage of induction
chemotherapy in the EPP group is instead mainly due to historical
reasons, as prior to 2007 when EPP was the only accepted proced-
ure, induction chemotherapy was not standard.
Although 7 cases of grade 2 radiation pneumonia were
observed, severe pulmonary complications were not observed
after PD-PORT. A progressive decline of lung function after
PD-PORT has been recently documented [24], but because lung
function loss occurs slowly over time, it is likely to be better toler-
ated than the acute loss of one entire lung that occurs with EPP.
The assessment of lung function was not systematically carried out
in our patients during the follow-up.
PD in our study was associated with marginally better OS than
palliative pleurectomy, despite the mean age-adjusted CCI being
higher, whereas in the EPP group survival not was significantly
different from that in the palliative pleurectomy group (Fig. 1B).
Available evidence in favour of radical surgery for MPM is
currently derived from observational cohort studies or on pooled
retrospective analyses, and this study is not an exception.
However, large randomized trials of radical surgery for MPM
are extremely difficult to conduct due to the rarity of this disease,
to the high level of expertise that is needed to manage these
patients, and to lack of equipoise among medical professionals
that substantially hinders accrual.
In the MARS (Mesothelioma And Radical Surgery) trial [25], the
only published randomized study of EPP versus chemotherapy,
no survival advantage was observed with EPP. Median survival
time of the chemotherapy-arm patients—who were fit for EPP but
randomly assigned not to have surgery—was 19 months, similar to
survival time after EPP in many observational trials. Although
the MARS trial was in fact a feasibility study that enrolled only
50 patients overall, these data inevitably raise doubt about the
capacity of EPP to change the clinical course of MPM patients for
the better.
As stated, the main limitation of this study is that it is not a ran-
domized trial. Subgroup analyses unavoidably resulted in small
numbers and important prognostic factors may have been distrib-
uted in an unbalanced fashion. A slightly higher percentage of
biphasic histology was in fact observed in the palliative pleurect-
omy subgroup (Table 1); and potential prognostic factors such as
haemoglobin levels, white blood cell counts and tumour volume
were not analysed. Besides, accrual over a long time-span resulted
in a mixed population, receiving different management modalities
over time.
Strengths of this study are that all patients were treated and
followed in a single centre; selection criteria for surgery were con-
sistent over time, a validated comorbidity measure was used to
classify all patients according to their baseline status, postoperative

 complications were described according to WHO-based criteria
and information about delayed treatment-related morbidity was
collected.
In conclusion, our data show that postoperative morbidity and
mortality of radical surgery are not negligible even where ad-
equate expertise is available, and that significant complications of
EPP, pleural sepsis in particular, may still occur a long time after
discharge.
Owing to its high frequency and significant adverse impact on
patients’ general condition, pleural sepsis may independently con-
tribute to a reduced life expectancy after EPP.
The CCI is a strong independent predictor of postoperative
complications and survival in MPM and we propose that it should
be collected and evaluated together with other known prognostic
factors in all trials involving MPM patients.
Whether a multimodality approach that includes PD can
benefit MPM patients and confer a survival advantage over
chemotherapy alone still needs to be defined, despite all foresee-
able difficulties, in a randomized setting.
