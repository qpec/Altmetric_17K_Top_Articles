Abstract
Background: The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the relationships between sedentary behaviour
(SB) and health indicators in children aged 0 to 4 years, and to determine what doses of SB (i.e., duration, patterns
[frequency, interruptions], and type) were associated with health indicators.
Methods: Online databases were searched for peer-reviewed studies that met the a priori inclusion criteria:
population (apparently healthy, 1 month to 4.99 years), intervention/exposure and comparator (durations, patterns,
and types of SB), and outcome/health indicator (critical: adiposity, motor development, psychosocial health,
cognitive development; important: bone and skeletal health, cardiometabolic health, fitness, risks/harm). The quality
of the evidence was assessed by study design and outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.
Results: Due to heterogeneity, meta-analyses were not possible; instead, narrative syntheses were conducted,
structured around the health indicator and type of SB. A total of 96 studies were included (195,430 participants
from 33 countries). Study designs were: randomized controlled trial (n = 1), case-control (n = 3), longitudinal (n = 25),
longitudinal with additional cross-sectional analyses (n = 5), and cross-sectional (n = 62). Evidence quality ranged
from “very low” to “moderate”. Associations between objectively measured total sedentary time and indicators of
adiposity and motor development were predominantly null. Associations between screen time and indicators of
adiposity, motor or cognitive development, and psychosocial health were primarily unfavourable or null.
Associations between reading/storytelling and indicators of cognitive development were favourable or null.
Associations between time spent seated (e.g., in car seats or strollers) or in the supine position, and indicators of
adiposity and motor development, were primarily unfavourable or null. Data were scarce for other outcomes.
Conclusions: These findings continue to support the importance of minimizing screen time for disease prevention
and health promotion in the early years, but also highlight the potential cognitive benefits of interactive non-
screen-based sedentary behaviours such as reading and storytelling. Additional high-quality research using valid
and reliable measures is needed to more definitively establish the relationships between durations, patterns, and
types of SB and health indicators, and to provide insight into the appropriate dose of SB for optimal health in the
early years.

 Background
Sedentary behaviour is defined as any waking behaviour
with an energy expenditure of ≤1.5 metabolic equiva-
lents (METs) while in a sitting or reclining posture [1].
It is increasingly recognized that too much sedentary
behaviour can have negative health effects across the
lifespan [2–4], which are distinct from those that result
from low physical activity [5]. This may be of particular
importance in the early years of life, given that these
years are critical for growth and development, and that
lifestyle behaviours established early in life tend to track
over time [6–8].
In this regard, the Canadian Sedentary Behaviour
Guidelines for the Early Years (ages 0–4 years) [9], and
guidelines in other countries around the world (e.g.,
Australia [10] and USA [11]), recommend that children
<2 years of age have no exposure to screens, and that
those aged 2 to 4 years have <1 h/day of screen time. In
addition, guidelines (e.g., in Canada [9], Australia [10],
and the United Kingdom [12]) recommend that parents
and caregivers minimize the time that children spend
sitting or being restrained (e.g., in a stroller or high
chair) while awake.
In contrast to these recommendations, ≥ 80% of young
children are exposed to screens before the age of 2 years
[13, 14], only 22% of Canadian children aged 3 to 4 years
are meeting the screen time guidelines of <1 h/day, and
on average parent-reported screen time for this age
group is 2.0 h/day [15]. Moreover, young children are
spending a substantial proportion of their time seden-
tary,
and
no
guidance
regarding
an
“appropriate”
amount of total sedentary time exists. This is a notable
gap, given that a recent review including data from 10
countries reported that children aged 2 to 5 years were
sedentary for 34% to 94% of the day [16]. For instance,
objectively measured data from a large, nationally repre-
sentative sample of Canadian children showed that, on
average, 3- to 4-year-olds were sedentary for 436 min/
day (7 h, 16 min), which was roughly equivalent to 60%
of their waking time [15].
The Canadian Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines were
informed by a systematic review of the evidence that
found that high levels of television (TV) time were
associated with increased adiposity and reduced psy-
chosocial health and cognitive development [2]. How-
ever, there was no evidence of benefits or harms for
any other type of sedentary behaviour, for total seden-
tary time, or for patterns (e.g., frequency, interrup-
tions) of sedentary time. This may be in part because
only
intervention
and
longitudinal
studies
were
included in this earlier review [2]. This is a critical
limitation because in recent years there has been a
dramatic shift in the media landscape (e.g., evolving
technologies including smartphones and tablets) [17],
and because different types of sedentary behaviour
(e.g., reading, sitting, playing video games) [18, 19]
and different patterns of sedentary behaviour [20]
may have different health effects. Evidence from large
cross-sectional studies (with samples representative of
the general population), together with new studies
published
since
the
original
review,
may
provide
additional insight.
In the intervening years, new systematic reviews have
been conducted to investigate the relationships between
sedentary behaviour and particular health indicators. For
instance, Hinkley et al. found that too little evidence
existed
to
draw
conclusions
regarding
associations
between sedentary behaviours and psychosocial well-
being [21], and Carson et al. identified that different
types of sedentary behaviour may have different effects
on cognitive development in the early years of life (e.g.,
screen time may be detrimental, and reading beneficial)
[18]. These recent reviews present focused summaries;
however, no previous review has provided a balanced
consideration of different types of sedentary behaviour
and a range of holistic health indicators across study
designs. Accordingly, a comprehensive review of the lit-
erature was needed in order to: 1) understand the health
effects of sedentary behaviour in the early years, 2)
inform and update population-level recommendations,
and 3) identify research gaps and guide the design of
future research and/or assist in the translation of current
research to practice.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a
systematic
review
that
examined
the
relationships
between sedentary behaviour and health indicators in
children in their early years (0 to 4 years). An additional
aim was to determine what doses of sedentary behaviour
(i.e., duration, patterns [frequency, interruptions], and
type) were associated with health indicators.
Methods
Protocol and registration
This systematic review was registered with the Inter-
national
Prospective
Register
of
Systematic
Reviews
(PROSPERO; Registration no. CRD42016035270; available
from
http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_re-
cord.asp?ID=CRD42016035270), and was conducted and
reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic
Reviews
and
Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA)
statement [22].
Eligibility criteria
The Population, Interventions, Comparisons, Outcomes,
and Study design (PICOS) framework [23] was used to
identify key study concepts in the research question, and
to facilitate the search process.

 Population
The population of interest was apparently healthy chil-
dren (i.e., general populations, including those with over-
weight and obesity; samples of clinical populations were
ineligible) with a mean age of 1 month to 4.99 years (or,
if no mean age was reported, samples described as:
infants, toddlers, preschoolers, pre-elementary or pre-
primary school age) for at least one sedentary behaviour
measurement point. Subgroups were defined as follows:
infants, 1 month to 1 year; toddlers, 1.1 to 3.0 years; and
preschoolers, 3.1 to 4.99 years.
Intervention (exposure)
The intervention/exposure was a specific measure of seden-
tary behaviour (e.g., TV viewing, video gaming, iPad/tablet/
touch-screen, smart phone, reading, puzzles, bouts, breaks,
sedentary time, and “screen time” – defined as composite
measures of screen use) obtained via objective (e.g., accel-
erometry) or subjective (e.g., proxy-report) methods. For
infants, sedentary behaviour was operationally defined as
any waking behaviour characterized by low energy expend-
iture (i.e., non-purposefully active) while restrained (e.g., in
a stroller/pram, high chair, car seat/capsule), or when sedate
(e.g., lying/sitting in a chair with little movement but not re-
strained). Time spent in the prone position (“tummy time”)
was not considered sedentary behaviour because this is
deemed “physical activity” in this age group. For toddlers
and preschoolers, sedentary behaviour was defined as any
waking behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure
of ≤1.5 METs while in a sitting or reclining posture [1].
Studies defining sedentary behaviour as “physical inactivity”
or “failing to meet physical activity guidelines” were
excluded, because these definitions do not differentiate
between sedentary behaviour and light-intensity physical
activity. Studies of active video gaming exposures (e.g., Nin-
tendo Wii™, Microsoft Kinect™, Sony’s Playstation Move™)
were excluded because these games may elicit energy
expenditure > 1.5 METs [24], as were studies reporting
background TV or screen access (e.g., TV is turned on, but
not necessarily being watched by the child) because the
child could be engaged in a non-sedentary behaviour. For
experimental studies, interventions had to target sedentary
behaviour exclusively and not multiple health behaviours
(e.g., both sedentary behaviour and diet).
Comparison
Various durations, patterns (frequencies, interruptions),
and types of sedentary behavior were used for compari-
son where available. A comparison or control group was
not required.
Outcomes (health indicators)
Eight health indicators were chosen by expert consensus
among a 22-member group with expertise in movement
behaviours in children. The health indicators were
selected given consideration of the literature (previous
reviews; e.g., [2]) and of the importance of including a
range of holistic health indicators (i.e., physical, psycho-
logical/social, and cognitive health). Four health indica-
tors were identified as critical (primary) by expert
consensus: (1) adiposity (e.g., % body fat, weight status,
waist circumference); (2) motor development (e.g., devel-
opmental milestones, gross/fine motor skills, locomotor-
object control); (3) psychosocial health (e.g., depressive/
anxiety symptoms, prosocial behaviour, aggression, self-
regulation); and (4) cognitive development (e.g., lan-
guage development, attention, executive function). Four
health indicators were identified as important (second-
ary) by expert consensus: (1) bone and skeletal health
(e.g.,
bone
mineral
density,
bone
mineral
content,
skeletal area); (2) cardiometabolic health (e.g., blood
pressure, insulin resistance, blood lipids); (3) fitness
(cardiovascular, musculoskeletal); and (4) risks (injury)/
harm (e.g., plagiocephaly, torticollis).
Study designs
All study designs were considered. For longitudinal stud-
ies, any follow-up length was allowed as long as there
was
at
least
one
measure
of
sedentary
behaviour
between the ages of 1 month to 4.99 years. For logistic
reasons, and to maximize generalizability, minimum
sample size requirements were imposed [25]; random-
ized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized inter-
vention studies were required to have at least 15
participants in at least one intervention group, and
observational studies were required to have a minimum
sample size of 100 participants. Published peer-reviewed
original
manuscripts
and
in-press
manuscripts,
in
English or French, were eligible for inclusion. Grey
literature (except for registered clinical trials) and con-
ference abstracts were excluded.
Information sources and search strategy
The following databases were searched using the Ovid
interface: MEDLINE (1946 to April 13, 2016), EMBASE
(1980 to 2016 week 15), PsycINFO (1806 to April Week
1 2016), and CENTRAL (February 2016). PubMed was
searched for any additional studies not yet indexed in
MEDLINE (April 11, 2016). SPORTdiscus (1949 to April
14, 2016) and Communication Source (April 12, 2016)
were searched using the EBSCOhost interface, and the
Communications
and
Mass
Media
Collection
was
searched using Gale. The MEDLINE search strategy was
created by a research librarian with expertise in system-
atic review searching and peer-reviewed by a second
research librarian. The search was then adapted for
other databases. No study design limits were applied,
and
searches
were
limited
to
English
and
French

 publications. Updates to all search strategies, limited to
randomized controlled trials for logistical reasons, were
performed
on
November
1,
2016,
to
capture
any
additional studies that had been published in the interim
between the initial searches and the data synthesis. The
search strategies are presented in Additional file 1. Trial
registries were also searched (https://clinicaltrials.gov/
and http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/; October 11, 2016) for
ongoing clinical trials, using search terms for the seden-
tary behaviour concept and age group of interest. The
International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction was
hand-searched, because this journal was not yet indexed
in any of these databases.
Bibliographic records were extracted as text files from the
Ovid, EBSCOHost, and Gale interfaces and imported into
Reference Manager Software (Version 11; Thompson
Reuters, San Francisco, CA, USA), where duplicate records
were removed. Titles and abstracts of the remaining
records were uploaded to DistillerSR (Evidence Partners,
Ottawa, ON, Canada), a secure internet-based software,
where they were screened against inclusion criteria inde-
pendently by two reviewers. Exclusion by both reviewers
was required for a study to be excluded at the title and
abstract stage; all other studies passed to full-text article
screening. Two independent reviewers examined all full-
text articles, and consensus was required for article inclu-
sion in the review. Discrepancies between reviewers were
resolved by discussion between themselves, or with the
larger review team if needed. Relevant review articles
identified during screening were also procured, and their
reference lists manually checked for studies potentially
missed by the search.
Data extraction
Data extraction forms were created by the study coordi-
nators, and reviewed and piloted by the review team.
Extraction was completed in Microsoft Excel by one
reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer.
Reviewers were not blinded to the authors or journals
when extracting data. Information was extracted regard-
ing important study characteristics (e.g., citation, study
design, country, sample size, age, and sex of partici-
pants); exposure (i.e., sedentary behaviour characteristics
[e.g., type, volume, duration, frequency, pattern, and
measurement and/or description of sedentary behaviour
intervention]); outcome/health indicators (e.g., measure-
ment type); results (e.g., odds ratio, difference in means);
and covariates included in the analyses (if applicable;
e.g., diet, physical activity). If data were unavailable for
extraction (e.g., reported only in a graph, or described as
“data not shown”), the authors were contacted. If data
were
presented
subdivided
by
sex,
the
data
were
extracted independently for each sex only if data pooled
across sex were unavailable. If analyses were reported for
any other subsets of data, results were extracted for only
the analyses using the full sample. The results from
finally adjusted models were extracted when studies pre-
sented multiple models. Study findings were considered
statistically significant at p < 0.05.
Risk of bias and study quality assessment
The risk of bias was systematically evaluated in each pri-
mary research study using the methods described in the
Cochrane Handbook [26]. All individual studies were
assessed for the following potential sources of bias:
selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition
bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias (see
Poitras et al. [25] for details).
The quality of evidence for each health indicator by
each type of study design was assessed using the
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Develop-
ment and Evaluation (GRADE) framework [27]. The
“quality of evidence” is the level of confidence in the
estimate of effect. As such, the higher the quality of the
evidence, the greater the confidence in the findings, and
the lower the quality, the more likely it is that future
research will change the level of confidence in the esti-
mates and change the estimates themselves. According
to GRADE, there are four levels of quality (“high”, “mod-
erate”, “low”, and “very low”); evidence quality ratings
start at “high” for randomized studies and at “low” for
all other studies. The quality of evidence is downgraded
if there are limitations across studies due to serious risk
of bias, inconsistency (e.g., unexplained heterogeneity in
the direction of the effect), indirectness (e.g., differences
between the population, intervention and/or outcomes
in included studies and those of interest, such as a sur-
rogate measure instead of a direct measure of an out-
come), or imprecision (e.g., wide confidence intervals
that lead to uncertainty about the true magnitude of the
effect) [28]. If there is no reason to downgrade, the qual-
ity of evidence can be upgraded if there is a large effect
size, there is a dose-response gradient, or an effect is
detected in the presence of plausible confounders or
other biases that would decrease an apparent treatment
effect [29].
In the present review, the overall quality of evidence
for each study design within each health indicator was
evaluated by two independent reviewers and verified by
the larger review team. The review team decided a priori
not to downgrade for risk of bias if the only potential
sources of bias identified were use of a convenience
sample or lack of exposure/outcome blinding, as in pre-
vious movement behaviour systematic reviews [25, 30].
Synthesis of results

 methodological characteristics. If meta-analyses were not
possible, qualitative syntheses structured around the
health indicator and type of sedentary behaviour were
conducted, with all studies weighted equally, and the
results presented narratively. Results were presented in
“evidence profile” tables by outcome (health indicator)
as per the GRADE framework (see Guyatt et al. [27] for
details). For the purposes of this review, sedentary
behaviours were grouped into three categories: 1) object-
ively measured sedentary time, 2) screen-based sedentary
behaviours, and 3) other sedentary behaviours (e.g.,
reading, storytelling).
Results
Description of studies
A total of 10,830 records were identified in the initial
searches, and an additional 11 were identified by check-
ing the reference lists of review articles (Fig. 1). After
de-duplication, 8915 records remained. In the search
update, an additional 106 records were identified (mak-
ing a total of 10,936), and 101 of these remained after
de-duplication. No relevant records were identified in
the Trial Registry searches. After screening the 9016
titles
and
abstracts
(from
the
initial
and
updated
searches), 334 full-text articles were obtained for further
review. Reasons for exclusion were: not in English or
French language (n = 1), review paper (n = 2), sedentary
behaviour included only as a covariate or outcome and
not as the exposure (n = 2), sedentary behaviour defined
as “failing to meet physical activity guidelines” (n = 2),

between sedentary behaviour and a relevant health indi-
cator (n = 77), participants were not within appropriate

 was the same “dose” of sedentary behaviour with differ-
ent content, predatory publisher and problems with data
such as incongruent values in text and tables). Some
studies were excluded for multiple reasons. A total of 96
studies (from 73 unique samples) met the inclusion cri-
teria (Fig. 1).
Detailed findings for the individual 96 studies are
presented in Additional file 2: Tables S1-S7 and summa-
rized in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Data across studies
involved 195,430 participants (147,752 from 73 unique
samples), ranging from 103 [31] to 50,589 [32] participants.
Participants from one study were not included in this sam-
ple size calculation because the sample size for the age
group of interest was not reported [33]. Studies were con-
ducted in 33 different countries, but were most commonly
conducted in the United States (n = 44), Belgium (n = 7),
Canada (n = 7), Australia (n = 6), Germany (n = 5), and the
Netherlands (n = 5), with four or fewer studies from all
other countries (Additional file 2: Tables S1-S7). The
approximate baseline age ranged from 0.3 to 4.95 years.
One study used an experimental design (randomized
controlled trial); the remaining 95 studies used observa-
tional designs, including case-control (n = 3), longitudinal
(n = 25), longitudinal with additional cross-sectional ana-
lyses (n = 5), and cross-sectional (n = 62).
Quality of evidence
Overall, the quality of evidence ranged from “very low”
to “moderate” across study designs and health indicators.
The most common reason for downgrading the quality
of evidence was because of a serious risk of bias that
reduced the level of confidence in the observed effects.
Common sources of bias included: not accounting for
potentially important confounders or mediating factors
(e.g., diet); the use of potentially inappropriate measure-
ment tools (e.g., exposure or outcome measures with
unknown reliability and/or validity); and an unknown
amount of, or reasons for, missing data. The quality of
evidence was not upgraded in any instance. For specific
details regarding the quality of evidence by study design
and health indicator, see Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
Data synthesis
Meta-analyses
could
not
be
performed
because
of
heterogeneity in the sedentary behaviour exposure and
health
indicators
(statistical,
clinical,
and
methodo-
logical).
Instead,
narrative
syntheses
are
presented.
Unless otherwise stated, results did not differ by sex,
age, or specific sub-indicator within the eight health
indicator categories. Within each health indicator, results
are presented first by study design, then by type of sed-
entary behaviour exposure (objectively measured seden-
tary time, screen-based sedentary behaviours, and other
sedentary behaviours), and finally by sub-indicator (i.e.,
specific measures of the eight health indicators). The
reader is referred to the Additional file 2: Tables S1-S7
for statistic values and additional details.
Critical (primary) health indicators
Adiposity
The relationships between sedentary behaviour and adipos-
ity were examined in 60 studies (see Table 1 and
Additional file 2: Table S1) [31–90]. Study designs were:
randomized controlled trial (n = 1) [34], longitudinal (n =
13) [33, 45, 54, 81–90], case-control (n = 2) [35, 36], and
cross-sectional design or also reported cross-sectional find-
ings (n = 47) [31–33, 37–80]. Indicators of adiposity (e.g.,
body mass index [BMI]) were measured objectively (e.g.,
measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) or assessed
subjectively (e.g., parent-reported height and weight; see
Table 1 for summary of measures). The quality of evidence
ranged from “very low” to “moderate” across study designs
(Table 1).
In the randomized controlled trial of an intervention
to reduce screen time, screen time was significantly
lower for preschoolers in the intervention versus control
group at 2, 6, and 9 months post-intervention [34]. BMI
z-scores were not different between the intervention and
control groups at baseline or 9-month follow-up, but
BMI
z-scores
increased
in
both
groups
[34]
(Additional file 2: Table S1).
Among the 13 longitudinal studies, sedentary behaviour
was assessed from age ~9 months to 4.95 years as screen-
based (i.e., computer time, frequency of playing computer
games, time watching DVDs, TV time, and total screen
time) or other sedentary behaviours (i.e., time spent in the
car or in baby seats). Adiposity indicators were assessed
between ~1.25 and 12 years follow-up.
For screen-based sedentary behaviours, computer time
[85], and frequency of playing computer games [82] at age
4.8 years were not associated with total fat mass or lean
mass, or weight status, at ~6 and 12 years of follow-up
respectively. Time watching DVDs at ages ~3–4 years was
unfavourably associated with weight status at kindergarten
entry [83]. Total screen time in toddlers was unfavourably
associated with weight status at preschool or school age in
2/3 studies [33, 84]. In the third study, total screen time
was not associated with weight status [87].
Ten longitudinal studies examined the relationships
between TV time (at ages ranging from ~6 months to
4.8 years) and adiposity indicators at ~1.5 to 12 years of
follow-up. Of these, unfavourable associations were
reported in 6/10 studies [33, 54, 81, 83, 88, 90], null
associations in 1/10 studies [86], and mixed unfavour-
able and null associations in 3/10 studies [82, 85, 89].
Specifically, TV time was prospectively unfavourably
associated with these adiposity indicators: BMI z-score
in 1/1 studies [88], BMI in 2/3 studies [54, 90], % change

The range of mean ages at time of exposure measurement was ~0.75 to 4.95 years; the oldest mean age at follow-up was 15.5 years. Data were collected by randomized trial, case-control, cross-sectionally, and up to 12 years of
follow-up. Adiposity measures were: BMI (absolute, z-score, SD score, percentile); fat mass index, lean mass index, trunk fat mass index; % body fat (measured using DXA); skinfold ratio (triceps skinfold thickness to subscapular
skinfold thickness); sum of skinfolds; waist-to-height ratio; waist-to-hip ratio; weight-for-height (z-score); weight-for-age (z-score); waist circumference (absolute, z-score for age); weight status (CDC, IOTF, or WHO cut-points;
Flemish reference data; French reference standards; Rolland Cachera reference curves; United Kingdom reference standards in 1999); total fat mass (SD score); lean mass (SD score).

variables or mediating factors: sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and sleep were assessed but not accounted for [33]; diet was not measured or included in the analysis [45]; adjusted for physical activity [89]; of
the potential child and family confounders that were assessed, potential confounders were included or omitted from analyses based on the authors’ determination of what was “likely to be linked to our predictor or
outcome variables,” without providing a basis for that determination [89]. Data were pooled from the control and experimental groups of a messaging-based obesity prevention intervention study [33]

mSerious risk of bias. Potentially inappropriate sampling technique: participants were a non-representative convenience sample [66]; sampling deviated from protocol and specific deviations were not documented [57].
Potentially inappropriate measurement tools were used: questionable validity and reliability of the exposure measure [31–33, 41, 43–46, 49–51, 54–62, 64–76] and outcome measure [65]; questionable validity of exposure
measure [42, 52, 63, 79]; poor reliability of exposure measure [42]; height and weight were obtained by parent-report [44, 70]; options for 2–3 h and 4–5 h were missing from the Likert-type scale used to assess screen time
[74]; applied accelerometry cut-points were not validated for the age group of interest [47]. Potential attrition bias: amount of unexplained missing exposure or outcome data is unknown [42, 50] or ranged from 14% to 67%
[39, 40, 42, 43, 59, 60, 69, 71, 73, 74, 76], and reason may be related to the true outcome of interest [40, 43, 66, 71]. Potential selective reporting bias: statistics for non-significant relationships were not reported [48, 64]; authors
decided post-hoc not to report analyses with continuous exposure variables [59]; only final model was reported [44]; results for correlations described in the methods section were not reported [62]; composite outcomes were
presented without individual components; results for categorical screen time and total screen time described in the methods section were not reported [32]; outcomes from pooled hierarchical linear regression and variance
information of included results were not reported [70]. Did not account for potentially important confounding variables or mediating factors: diet [43, 45, 46, 50, 58, 60, 63, 64, 67, 71, 72, 77, 80]; sugar-sweetened beverage
consumption; and sleep [33]. Controlled for physical activity [59, 61, 66, 78]. Sleep during the day was considered sedentary time [40]

 in BMI and % change in waist-to-height ratio in 1/1
studies [33], fat mass in 1/1 studies [82], and weight sta-
tus in 2/2 studies [81, 83] (Additional file 2: Table S1).
TV time at age ~3 years was not associated with the rate
of weight gain from ages 3 to 5 years [86]. TV time at
age 2.4 years was not associated with waist circumfer-
ence at age 10.15 years, but the change in TV time from
ages 2.4 to 4.4 years was unfavourably associated with
waist circumference at age 10.15 years [89]. TV time at
age 3.2 years was unfavourably associated with fat mass
at age 15 years.
Regarding other sedentary behaviours, types of sitting
were examined in three longitudinal studies. Among
preschoolers, time in the car was not prospectively asso-
ciated with adiposity indicators in 2/2 studies [82, 85];
however, among infants there were mixed unfavourable,
null, and favourable associations between time in baby
seats and adiposity indicators [45]. Specifically, time in
baby seats at age ~9 months was unfavourably associ-
ated with a change in weight-for-height and change in
weight-for-age from ~9 months to 2 years, was not asso-
ciated with weight-for-height or weight-for-age at age
~2 years, and was favourably associated with waist
circumference-for-age at age ~2 years and change in
waist circumference-for-age from ~9 months to 2 years
[45] (Additional file 2: Table S1).
In the two case-control studies, TV time [35, 36] and
total sedentary time (assessed by one-day parent-recall)
[36]
were
not
significantly
different
between
pre-
schoolers with overweight/obese (case group) or normal-
weight (control group) status, but watching TV for ≥1 h/
day was unfavourably associated with having overweight
status [35] (Additional file 2: Table S1).
Among
the
47
cross-sectional
studies,
sedentary
behaviour was assessed as accelerometer-derived seden-
tary time, screen-based (i.e., computer time, time playing
inactive
video
games, using the
internet,
watching
DVDs/videos, TV time, and total screen time), or other
sedentary behaviours (i.e., sedentary quiet play, and time
in the car or in baby seats).
The relationships between accelerometer-derived seden-
tary time and adiposity indicators in toddlers and pre-
schoolers were examined in 11 cross-sectional studies; null
associations were reported in 10/11 studies [37–40, 47, 53,
60, 75, 78, 80] and mixed unfavourable and null associa-
tions in 1/11 studies [77] (Additional file 2: Table S1).
Specifically, total sedentary time was not associated with: %
body fat, fat mass index, trunk fat mass index, or lean mass
index in 1/1 studies [78]; BMI in 1/1 studies [75]; BMI z-
score in 4/4 studies [37–39, 47]; and weight status in 4/4
studies [40, 53, 60, 80] (Additional file 2: Table S1). Total
sedentary time was not associated with BMI z-score

waist circumference percentile in girls (not boys) in 1/1
studies [77]. Accelerometer-derived sedentary time in 30-
min bouts was not associated with weight status [40].
For screen-based sedentary behaviours, time playing
inactive video games was unfavourably associated with
preschoolers’ BMI percentile, but using the internet and
watching DVDs/videos were not cross-sectionally associ-
ated with BMI percentile [69] (Additional file 2: Table S1).
Computer time was not associated with preschoolers’
weight status in 4/4 studies [63, 67, 71, 79], but was
unfavourably associated with sum of skinfold thicknesses
in 1/1 studies [71].
The relationships between total screen time and adi-
posity indicators were examined in 18 cross-sectional
studies; unfavourable associations were reported in 6/18
studies [32, 33, 46, 50, 59, 73], null associations in 10/18
studies [44, 52, 57, 58, 62, 64, 65, 71, 72, 79], and mixed
unfavourable and null associations in 2/18 studies [41,
61] (Additional file 2: Table S1). Of these, screen time
was unfavourably associated with: sum of skinfold thick-
nesses in 0/1 studies, waist-to-height ratio in 1/1 studies
[33], BMI in 2/2 studies [46, 50], and at least one meas-
ure of weight status in 6/16 studies [32, 33, 41, 59, 61,
73]. Only one of these studies was in infants (no associ-
ation between screen time and weight status [58]); the
rest were in toddlers and preschoolers.
The relationships between TV time and adiposity indi-
cators in toddlers and preschoolers were examined in 23
cross-sectional studies; unfavourable associations were
reported in 5/23 studies [33, 55, 66, 67, 71], null associa-
tions in 11/23 studies [31, 42, 43, 49, 50, 56, 60, 63, 69,
75, 76], mixed unfavourable and null associations in 5/
23 studies [48, 51, 54, 68, 79], mixed null and favourable
associations in 1/23 studies [74], and mixed unfavour-
able, null, and favourable associations in 1/23 studies
[70] (Additional file 2: Table S1). Of these, TV time was
unfavourably associated with: waist-to-hip ratio in 0/1
studies, waist-to-height ratio in 1/1 studies [33], triceps
skinfold thickness in 0/1 studies, waist circumference in
0/2 studies, sum of skinfolds in 1/3 studies [71], BMI
percentile in 0/1 studies, BMI in 2/11 studies [51, 54],
and at least one measure of weight status in 9/13 studies
[33, 48, 55, 66–68, 70, 71, 79]. Weekday (but not week-
end) TV time was favourably associated with the ratio of
triceps to subscapular skinfold thickness (representing
limb-to-trunk adiposity ratio) in girls but not boys in 1/1
studies [74]. TV time was favourably associated with
BMI z-score in boys but not girls in 1/1 studies [70]
(Additional file 2: Table S1).
Regarding other sedentary behaviours, infants’ time in
baby seats was not cross-sectionally associated with
weight-for-height/age
or
waist
circumference-for-age
[45]. Among preschoolers, time using books [69] was
not associated with BMI percentile [69]. Sedentary quiet
play (defined as “e.g., looking into books, playing with
blocks, playing with dolls, drawing, construction”) on
weekdays or weekend days was not associated with
weight status in boys [79]. In girls, sedentary quiet play
on weekend days (but not weekdays) was unfavourably
associated with weight status [79].
Motor development
The relationships between sedentary behaviour and motor
development were examined in seven studies (see Table 2
and Additional file 2: Table S2) [37, 40, 88, 91–94]. Study

 designs were: longitudinal (n = 3) [88, 91, 92], and cross-
sectional (n = 4) [37, 40, 93, 94]. Indicators of motor
development were measured objectively (e.g., visual-motor
abilities measured using the Wide-Range Assessment of
Visual Motor Ability) or assessed subjectively by parent-
report (e.g., age at first sitting; see Table 2 for summary of
measures). The quality of evidence was “very low” across
study designs (Table 2).
Among
the
three
longitudinal
studies,
sedentary
behaviour was assessed from age 3.9 months to 2.4 years as
screen-based (i.e., TV time) or other sedentary behaviours
(i.e., time in a baby carrier/sling, car seat, high chair/other
chair, playpen, or stroller). Motor development indicators
were assessed after 1.3 to 3 years of follow-up. For screen-
based sedentary behaviours, TV time was not prospectively
associated with age at first sitting, crawling, or walking [91],
visual-motor abilities [88], or object control [92], but was
unfavourably associated with locomotion skills [92].
Regarding other sedentary behaviours, infants’ time in
a baby carrier/sling, stroller, high chair or other chair, or
playpen was not associated with age at first sitting,
crawling, or walking [91] (Additional file 2: Table S2).
Greater time in a car seat at age ~9 months was associ-
ated with earlier (i.e., favourable) age at first sitting and
age at first crawling, but was not associated with age at
first walking; time spent in a car seat at ages ~4 months
and 1.7 years was not associated with age at first sitting,
crawling, or walking [91].
In the 4 cross-sectional studies, sedentary behaviour
was assessed as accelerometer-derived sedentary time,
screen-based (i.e., TV time), or other sedentary behav-
iours (i.e., time in the supine position). The relationships
between
accelerometer-derived
sedentary
time
and
motor development were examined in two of the cross-
sectional studies. Total sedentary time was not associ-
ated with motor skills at age ~2 years [40] or ~3 to
4 years [37], or with object control skills at age ~3 to
4 years [37], but % sedentary time was unfavourably
associated with locomotor skills at age ~3 to 4 years
[37]. The number of 30-min bouts of sedentary behav-
iour was not associated with motor skills [40].
For screen-based sedentary behaviours, TV time was
unfavourably associated with motor skill development;
children with delayed motor skill development spent
more time watching TV compared to children with typ-
ical motor skill development, and children who were fre-
quently exposed to TV (>0 h/day for children <2 years
and >2 h/day for children ≥2 years) were more likely to
have delayed motor skill development than those who
were infrequently exposed [94].
For other sedentary behaviours, time in the supine
position before 6 months of age was not associated with
gross motor performance, but time in the supine pos-
ition after age 6 months was unfavourably associated
with gross motor performance [93].
Psychosocial health
The relationships between sedentary behaviour and psy-
chosocial health in toddlers and preschoolers were
examined in 15 studies (no studies in infants; see Table 3
and Additional file 2: Table S3) [34, 90, 92, 95–106].
Study designs were: randomized controlled trial (n = 1)
[34], longitudinal (n = 9) [90, 92, 95–97, 99, 100, 102,
103], and cross-sectional design or additionally reported
cross-sectional findings (n = 7) [98, 100, 101, 103–106].

jectively by parent-, teacher-, or self-report using ques-
tionnaires (see Table 3 for summary of measures). The
quality of evidence ranged from “very low” to “moderate”
across study designs (Table 3).
In the randomized controlled trial of an intervention
to reduce screen time, preschoolers’ screen time was sig-
nificantly lower in the intervention versus control group
at 2, 6, and 9 months post-intervention [34]. Aggressive
and delinquent behaviours were not significantly differ-
ent between the intervention and control groups at base-
line, but were significantly lower in the intervention
versus control group at 9-months post-intervention [34]
(Additional file 2: Table S3).
Among the nine longitudinal studies, screen-based
sedentary behaviour (i.e., time e-gaming or on a com-
puter, or TV time) was assessed from age ~1.5 to 5 years.
Psychosocial health indicators were assessed after ~1 to
9.5 years of follow-up.
Time spent e-gaming or on a computer (on weekdays
or weekend days) at age 4.3 years was not associated
with being at risk for the following at age 6.3 years: peer
problems, self-esteem problems, social well-being prob-
lems, social functioning problems, or family functioning
problems [96]. Time spent e-gaming or on a computer
on weekdays (but not weekend days) at age 4.3 years
was unfavourably associated with being at risk for emo-
tional problems at age 6.3 years in girls but not boys
[96] (Additional file 2: Table S3).
The relationships between TV time among toddlers/
preschoolers
and
psychosocial
health
indicators
at
follow-up were examined in nine longitudinal studies;
unfavourable associations were reported in 2/9 studies
[95, 103], null associations in 1/9 studies [100], mixed
unfavourable and null associations in 5/9 studies [90, 92,
96, 97, 99], and mixed null and favourable associations
in 1/9 studies [102] (Additional file 2: Table S3). Specif-
ically, TV time was prospectively unfavourably associ-
ated with the following psychosocial health indicators:
victimization [90, 95], victimization by classmates [92],
being a victim of bullying [97], being a bully [103], exter-
nalizing problems [99], and being at risk for family func-
tioning problems [96] (Additional file 2: Table S3). Null
associations were reported between TV time and emo-
tional symptoms [100]; conduct problems [100]; peer-
problems
[100];
prosocial
behaviour
[92,
100];
externalizing problems [99, 102]; anxiety or depressive
symptoms [92, 102]; physical aggression [100] or aggres-
sive behaviour [102]; being a bully, being a victim of bully-
ing, or being a bully-victim [97]; being at risk for
emotional problems, peer problems, self-esteem problems,
emotional well-being problems, or social functioning
problems [96]; and co-operation, self-control, assertion,
responsibility, or total social skills [102]. TV time at age
~2.5 years was favourably associated with emotional
reactivity scores after ~3 years of follow-up [102].
In the 7 cross-sectional studies, sedentary behaviour
was assessed as accelerometer-derived total sedentary
time or screen-based (i.e., TV time) sedentary behaviour.
Total sedentary time (accelerometer-derived) was not
cross-sectionally associated with preschoolers’ psycho-
social health indicators (soothability, sociability, or emo-
tionality) [104].
The relationships between TV time and psychosocial
health indicators in toddlers and preschoolers were
examined in six cross-sectional studies; unfavourable as-
sociations were reported in 2/6 studies [101, 103], null
associations in 2/6 studies [100, 106], mixed unfavour-
able and null associations in 1/6 studies [105], and
mixed unfavourable and favourable associations in 1/6
studies [98]. Specifically, TV time was unfavourably
associated with aggression [101], bullying [103], total
externalizing behaviour problems [105], and total be-
haviour problems [105]. Null associations were re-
ported between TV time and emotional symptoms,
conduct problems, peer problems, and prosocial be-
haviour [100], aggression toward a sibling [106], and
internalizing behaviour problems [105]. TV time was
favourably associated with social-emotional compe-
tence in one study [98].
Cognitive development
The relationships between sedentary behaviour and
cognitive development were examined in 25 studies (see
Table 4 and Additional file 2: Table S4) [88, 90, 92, 94,
100, 102, 104, 107–124]. Study designs were: longitu-
dinal (n = 11) [88, 90, 92, 100, 102, 112, 113, 119–122],
case-control (n = 1) [116], and cross-sectional design or
additionally reported cross-sectional findings (n = 16)
[90, 94, 100, 104, 107–111, 114, 115, 117, 118, 121, 123,
124]. Indicators of cognitive development were mea-
sured
objectively
(e.g.,
working
memory
capacity
measured using the Memory for Digit Span test) or
assessed subjectively by parent-report interview or ques-
tionnaire (e.g., receptive vocabulary; see Table 4 for
summary of measures). The quality of evidence was
“very low” across study designs (Table 4).
Among the 11 longitudinal studies, sedentary behav-
iour was assessed from age ~6 months to 5 years as
screen-based (i.e., electronic media exposure and TV
time) or other sedentary behaviours (i.e., frequency of
parents reading). Cognitive development indicators were
assessed after ~8 months to 8 years of follow-up.
For
screen-based
sedentary
behaviours,
electronic
media exposure at age ~6 months was unfavourably
associated with the following at age 14 months: cognitive
development,

inattention [100] (Additional file 2: Table S4).
Regarding other sedentary behaviours, the frequency
of parents reading to their child from ages ~8 months to
4 years was favourably associated with both language
development at age 4 years and the rate of change in
language development between ages 5 to 7 years [121]
(Additional file 2: Table S4).
In the case-control study, toddlers with language delay
(cases) had significantly greater TV time than those with
normal language development (controls) [116]. Com-
pared with toddlers who viewed ≤2 h/day TV time, those
with >2 h/day TV time had increased odds of language
delay [116].
In the 16 cross-sectional studies, sedentary behaviour
was assessed as accelerometer-derived sedentary time,
screen-based (i.e., computer use, mobile phone use, time
playing inactive video games, TV time, total media expos-
ure, and total screen time), or other sedentary behaviours
(i.e., reading or storytelling with parents). Only one cross-
sectional
study
examined
the
association
between
accelerometer-derived total sedentary time and cognitive
development indicators; total sedentary time was not asso-
ciated with attention span in preschoolers [104].
For screen-based sedentary behaviours, computer use
was not associated with the prevalence of speech disor-
ders, but mobile phone use (any versus none) was
unfavourably associated with speech disorders in tod-
dlers and preschoolers [109]. Time playing inactive video
games was not associated with hyperactivity or attention
problems in preschoolers [107]. Total screen time was
unfavourably associated with communication develop-
ment in toddlers [111], and total media exposure was
unfavourably associated with receptive language devel-
opment and expressive language development in infants
and toddlers aged ~6 months to 1.3 years, but not with
total language development in toddlers aged ~1.4 to
2.3 years [124].
The relationships between TV time and cognitive
development in toddlers and preschoolers were exam-
ined in nine cross-sectional studies; unfavourable associ-
ations were reported in 3/9 studies [94, 108, 123], null
associations in 5/9 studies [90, 100, 114, 115, 121], and
mixed unfavourable and null associations in 1/9 studies
[118] (see Additional file 2: Table S4 for statistics). Spe-
cifically, TV time was unfavourably associated with lan-
guage development or capacity in 2/5 studies [94, 108]
(Additional file 2: Table S4). TV time was unfavourably
associated with delayed executive function [123] and
cognitive development [94], but was not associated with
cognitive ability [90] (Additional file 2: Table S4). TV
time was not associated with hyperactivity-inattention in
toddlers [100], and was unfavourably associated with
teacher-reported, but not parent-reported, attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in pre-
schoolers [118] (Additional file 2: Table S4).
Regarding other sedentary behaviours, the relation-
ships between reading with parents and cognitive devel-
opment indicators in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers
were examined in three cross-sectional studies [110, 117,
124], two of which analyzed the same dataset in different
ways [117, 124]; reading with parents was favourably
associated with language development percentile in both
infants and toddlers [117], but was not associated with
absolute language development in toddlers (not analyzed
in infants) [124]. Reading with parents was favourably
associated with absolute receptive language develop-
ment, but not expressive language development, in in-
fants [124]. In the third study, reading with parents was
not associated with executive function in preschoolers
[110]. Storytelling with parents was favourably associated
with language development percentile in infants [117].
In toddlers, storytelling was favourably associated with
absolute language development [124], but not language
development percentile [117]. Storytelling with parents
was favourably associated with absolute receptive lan-
guage development, but not expressive language devel-
opment, in infants [124] (Additional file 2: Table S4).
Important (secondary) health indicators
Bone and skeletal health
The relationship between sedentary behaviour and bone
and skeletal health in preschoolers was examined in one
cross-sectional study (see Table 5 and Additional file 2:
Table S5) [125]. The quality of evidence was rated as
“very low”. As summarized in Table 5, parent-reported
screen time and accelerometer-derived total sedentary
time were not associated with bone stiffness index in
preschool children [125]. No other indices of bone and
skeletal health were examined.
Cardiometabolic health
The relationship between sedentary behaviour and car-
diometabolic health in preschoolers was examined in
one
cross-sectional
study
(see
Table
6
and
Add-
itional file 2: Table S6) [126]. The quality of evidence
was rated as “very low”. Watching TV for ≥2 h/day was
The Author(s) BMC Public Health 2017, 17(Suppl 5):868
Page 82 of 215
 not associated with high blood pressure in preschool
children [126]. No other cardiometabolic biomarkers
were examined.
Fitness
The relationship between sedentary behaviour and fit-
ness in toddlers and preschoolers was examined in two
longitudinal studies (no studies in infants; see Table 7
and Additional file 2: Table S7) [89, 90]. The quality of
evidence was rated as “very low”.
As summarized in Table 7, greater TV time at age
~2.4 years was unfavourably associated with standing
long-jump performance at age ~8.2 years [89] and phys-
ical fitness level (assessed as “relative to other children”
via parent-report) in Grade 4 (age ~10 years) [90]. A
greater increase in TV time between age ~2.4 and
~4.4 years was unfavourably associated with standing
long-jump performance at age 8.2 years [89] and phys-
ical fitness level in Grade 4 [90].
Risks/harm
No studies examined harms associated with sedentary
behaviour.
Discussion
The objective of this study was to perform a systematic
review that examined the relationships between seden-
tary behaviours and health indicators in children 0 to
4 years, and to determine what doses of sedentary
behaviours (i.e., duration, patterns [frequency, interrup-
tions], and type) were associated with health indicators.
The main findings are the following: 1) associations
between objectively measured total sedentary time and
health indicators (adiposity and motor development)
were
predominantly
null;
2)
associations
between
screen-based sedentary behaviours and health indicators
(adiposity, motor or cognitive development, and psycho-
social health) were largely unfavourable or null; 3) asso-
ciations between reading or storytelling and cognitive
development were favourable or null; and 4) associations
between time spent seated (e.g., in baby seats, car seats,
high chairs or strollers) or in the supine position and
health indicators (adiposity, motor development) were
primarily unfavourable or null. Few studies examined
indicators of bone and skeletal health, cardiometabolic
health, or fitness, and no studies reported on risks or
harms (e.g., torticollis, injuries) associated with sedentary
behaviours. These findings suggest that, in the early
years, total sedentary time may have a negligible impact
on health, but the way that time is spent is important,
with screen-based and seated/supine sedentary behav-
iours likely to have unfavourable or null health effects
(unlikely to have favourable effects), and interactive non-
screen-based activities such as reading and storytelling
likely to have favourable health effects. A summary of
the findings is presented in Table 8.
The finding that there are no associations between
objectively measured total sedentary time and health
indicators in the early years (0 to 4 years) is in contrast
to the relationships in older age groups, in particular
adults [4, 127]. While this suggests that in the early years
a certain amount of sedentary behaviour may be innocu-
ous and perhaps even necessary for healthy growth and
development, these findings should be interpreted with
caution. First, objectively measured total sedentary time
was examined only in cross-sectional studies, and a
plausible explanation for the perceived lack of associ-
ation between total sedentary time and health indicators
is that there had simply been insufficient time for those
effects to manifest, rather than there being no effect.
This hypothesis is supported by comparison of findings
from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies for subsets
of total sedentary behaviour. For instance, 9/10 (90%)
longitudinal studies reported at least one unfavourable
association between TV time and adiposity indicators,
compared to only 11/22 (50%) cross-sectional studies.
However, total sedentary time was examined only in re-
lation to adiposity and motor development (and in
one study each for indicators of psychosocial health,
cognitive development, and bone and skeletal health);
it remains possible that total sedentary time is associ-
ated with other health indicators, particularly those
likely to be acutely affected in the early years, such as
cognitive
development.
More
well-designed
studies
with objective measures of sedentary behaviour are
needed.
Second, in the present review, studies that utilized
accelerometry measures applied a range of sampling
intervals (epochs) and cut-points. Given that these meas-
urement parameters influence the amount of sedentary
behaviour captured [128, 129], individual studies may
have under- or overestimated the total amount of seden-
tary time and may therefore have resulted in an under-
estimation or overestimation of true effects. However,
Byun et al. applied three different accelerometry cut-
points in two cross-sectional datasets to test whether
this would influence the findings, and found no associ-
ation between total sedentary time and BMI z-score,
regardless of the cut-points used [38]. Nonetheless, the
most appropriate way to objectively measure sedentary
behaviour in the early years is still unknown and remains
an important area for future work.
Lastly,
total
sedentary
time
was
not
objectively
assessed in any studies in the infant age group; however,
such
measures
may
not
be
meaningful
in
non-
ambulatory infants. Although the associations between
total sedentary time and health indicators were primarily
null, the present data do not allow for recommendations
The Author(s) BMC Public Health 2017, 17(Suppl 5):868
Page 83 of 215
 regarding “appropriate” amounts or patterning (e.g.,
breaks) of total sedentary time.
Regarding
screen-based
sedentary
behaviours,
the
present findings support and extend those of the earlier
systematic review [2]; overall, screen time (namely TV
time) was unfavourably associated with a range of health
indicators. Notably, TV time was the predominant meas-
ure of screen-based behaviour, followed by total screen
time, with only eight studies reporting relationships
between computer use and any health indicator; two
studies for each of DVDs/videos, electronic/total media
exposure, and inactive video games; and one study for
mobile phone and internet use. Findings for these other
screen exposures were mixed (unfavourable or null), and
suggest no benefits and some potential for harm.
Although it seems intuitive that different types of
screens may exert different effects (e.g., interacting on
video-chat versus passive screen use), research on chil-
dren’s use of such technologies lags behind their adop-
tion [130]; this is a substantial research gap. Importantly,
screen-based behaviours are used as a proxy for seden-
tary behaviour; however, it is uncertain whether children
in this age group are actually sedentary while using
screens, and there may be screen-related health effects
that are independent of the “lack of movement” [131,
132]. Notwithstanding these limitations, the present
findings indicate that less screen-based sedentary behav-
iour is better for optimal health in the early years of life.
Other sedentary behaviour exposures were less fre-
quently examined, and findings were mixed. In general,
reading [110, 117, 121, 124] and storytelling [117, 124]
were favourably associated with cognitive development,
while various types of time spent seated (e.g., in a car
seat, high chair, or stroller) had mixed unfavourable and
null associations with indicators of adiposity and motor
development [45, 81, 82, 91]. An age-dependent effect
was observed in the only study that assessed time in the
supine position; time spent supine before 6 months of
age was not associated with gross motor performance,
but greater time in the supine position after age
6 months was associated with worse gross motor per-
formance [93]. Overall, there was a paucity of data
regarding the relationships between other types of sed-
entary behaviours and health indicators. Research shows
that children are spending ~7 h of the day in sedentary
pursuits [15], and ~2 h of these are occupied by screen
time [15]; this leaves an additional 5 h that are
unaccounted for. Other types of sedentary behaviours
are thus highly understudied, and this is an important
research gap.
Most studies examined the duration of sedentary
behaviours in relation to health indicators, with only
three studies specifically examining the impact of pat-
terns of behaviour (i.e., breaks, frequency). Specifically,
there was no association between accelerometer-derived
sedentary time in 30-min bouts and indicators of adipos-
ity and motor development [40], or between the fre-
quency
of
playing
computer
games
and
adiposity
indicators [82], but there were favourable associations
between the frequency of parents reading or storytelling
and child cognitive development [121]. These findings
are consistent with those of studies that examined sed-
entary behaviour duration; however, it remains difficult
to draw conclusions regarding patterns of sedentary
behaviour for optimal health in the early years.
Strengths, limitations, and future directions
Strengths of this review include the use of a comprehen-
sive search strategy that was developed and peer-
reviewed by librarians with expertise in systematic
reviews, as well as inclusion of all study designs and a
broad range of health indicators that represent various
dimensions of health. Rigorous methodological stan-
dards were used in this review, including application of
the GRADE framework to guide the review process and
assess the quality of the evidence [27]. To our know-
ledge, this systematic review is the first to synthesize the
evidence regarding the relationships between objectively
and subjectively measured sedentary behaviour across
the most comprehensive range of health indicators in
children in the early years of life.
In terms of limitations, sample size restrictions were
imposed
for
feasibility
reasons
and
to
maximize
generalizability, but it is possible that studies with
smaller sample sizes might have provided additional
insight. Further, because of heterogeneity in the meas-
urement of sedentary behaviour and health indicators,
meta-analyses were not possible and all studies were
weighted equally in the narrative synthesis. The direc-
tion of associations (i.e., unfavourable, null, favourable)
was based on statistical significance; clinical significance
was not considered.
Although an abundance of evidence was synthesized
in this review, several limitations of this area of research
were identified that remain to be addressed. As men-
tioned, data were limited regarding the relationships
between sedentary behaviour and four relevant health
indicators (two or fewer studies for each of bone and
skeletal health, cardiometabolic health, fitness, and risks/
harms); TV time was the primary sedentary exposure,
with few studies examining “other” types of screens (e.g.,
tablets, mobile phones) or sedentary behaviours (e.g.,
reading, puzzles); and objective measures of total seden-
tary time were employed only in cross-sectional studies.
Although adiposity was the most commonly measured
health indicator (60 studies), direct measures of adipos-
ity were used in only two studies [78, 82] while the
remainder used surrogate measures such as BMI. Only
The Author(s) BMC Public Health 2017, 17(Suppl 5):868
Page 84 of 215
 one randomized controlled study was included in the
present review, and the quality of the evidence ranged
from “very low” to “moderate” across the study designs
and health indicators. There is a need for high-quality
studies with strong designs to better establish the magni-
tude of effects and the nature of dose-response gradients
(if applicable), to assess cause-and-effect relationships,
and to examine potential subgroup differences (e.g.,
based on age, sex, or socio-economic status). When
RCTs are not possible because of the inherent challenges
of research in this age group, quasi-experimental or lon-
gitudinal designs that use validated sedentary behaviour
measures and outcome measures that are sensitive
enough to detect changes are recommended.
Across the health indicators, the most common reason
for downgrading the quality of evidence was the serious risk
of bias associated with sedentary behaviour measures with
no known psychometric properties. Consequently, develop-
ment and use of reliable and valid subjective measures of
sedentary behaviour are needed. Defining and measuring
sedentary behaviour in young children, particularly in non-
ambulatory infants, remains a challenge. For instance,
infants in the supine position may be vigorously moving
arms and legs, and thus being “active”, but existing
questionnaire-based measures do not capture this. Future
research using inclinometers, which can more accurately
capture postures [133], as well as limb-worn devices, will
help to address the challenges associated with quantifying
sedentary behaviours in the early years. Finally, the question
of whether different types of sedentary behaviour “content”
(e.g., educational versus recreational TV programming)
exert different health effects was beyond the scope of this
review, and remains an important area for future work.
Conclusions
This systematic review synthesized findings from 96 studies
with ~200,000 participants in 33 countries around the
world; the quality of the evidence ranged from “very low”
to “moderate”. In summary, the findings demonstrate that
in the early years (0 to 4 years), total sedentary time may
have a negligible impact on health, but the quality of that
time is important, with screen-based and seated/supine
sedentary behaviours likely to have no benefit and a poten-
tial for harm, and interactive non-screen-based activities
such as reading with caregivers having favourable health
effects. These findings continue to support the importance
of minimizing screen time for disease prevention and
health promotion in the early years [2, 9], and also highlight
the potential benefits of interactive non-screen-based sed-
entary behaviours such as reading and storytelling. There is
a need for additional research using valid and reliable mea-
sures and high-quality study designs, to more definitively
establish the relationships between sedentary behaviours
and health indicators, and to provide insight into the
appropriate dose (durations, patterns, type) of sedentary be-
haviour for optimal health in the early years.
