Abstract As the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa is now contained,
attention is turning from control to future outbreak prediction and prevention. Building on a
previously published zoonotic niche map (Pigott et al., 2014), this study incorporates new human
and animal occurrence data and expands upon the way in which potential bat EVD reservoir
species are incorporated. This update demonstrates the potential for incorporating and updating
data used to generate the predicted suitability map. A new data portal for sharing such maps is
discussed. This output represents the most up-to-date estimate of the extent of EVD zoonotic risk
in Africa. These maps can assist in strengthening surveillance and response capacity to contain viral
haemorrhagic fevers.

Introduction
Since the index case in 2013, the West African Ebola epidemic has killed more than 11,000 people
(World Heath Organization, 2016) and exposed national and international inadequacies in pan-
demic preparedness and response (Moon et al., 2015). In 2014 a zoonotic niche map for Ebola virus
disease (EVD) was produced (Pigott et al., 2014) in part to assess the expected geographical extent
of spillover risk. This research was then expanded to explore how changes in demography and inter-
national connectivity may have facilitated the establishment and rapid subsequent spread of the epi-
demic (Bogoch et al., 2015). The West African outbreak of EVD has again highlighted key
information gaps that exist with respect to the broader epidemiology of Ebola virus, particularly con-
cerning viral persistence in reservoirs (Funk and Piot, 2014; Mari Saez et al., 2015; Leen-
dertz, 2016), and prompted a variety of questions concerning the role bats play in transmission
(Leendertz et al., 2016). Identifying reservoirs of zoonotic disease is a complex process
(Viana et al., 2014; Haydon et al., 2002) and whilst considerable sampling effort has been under-
taken over the years (Kuhn, 2008; Leirs et al., 1999), isolation of Ebolavirus from living animals has
been rare (Leroy et al., 2005). The original eLife study only incorporated the three bat species
found to be RNA-positive (Leroy et al., 2005). Whilst this remains currently the best evidence for an
animal reservoir species, it is important to consider that other sampling efforts may by chance repre-
sent false negatives, particularly if infection is rare.

RESEARCH ADVANCE
 Consequently, to contribute to these broader discussions, the original paper (Pigott et al., 2014)
was updated with new occurrence data and expanded to consider a wider range of potential bat
reservoir species. Bats remained the priority mammalian order given the previous viral isolation and
the repeated anecdotal implications in previous outbreaks (Leroy et al., 2009; Mari Saez et al.,
2015). Since there are a large number of bat species found in Africa, we defined three groupings,
based upon the strength of evidence supporting their potential Ebola reservoir status. As a result,
not only were the original three RNA-positive bats included (Leroy et al., 2005), but also those spe-
cies with serological evidence of EVD infection (Olival and Hayman, 2014) and those identified
through trait-based machine learning approaches as being similar to species already reporting filovi-
ral infection (Han et al., 2016).
Results
Six additional records of EVD were incorporated into the disease occurrence database: one human
outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Maganga et al., 2014); two reports of infections in
animals in Zambia (Ogawa et al., 2015); and three animal infections in Central African Republic
(Morvan et al., 1999) (Figure 1). Of these new occurrences, two in southern Central African Repub-
lic are found in areas predicted to be at-risk by the previous model (Pigott et al., 2014), with the
index case from the Democratic Republic of Congo located in close proximity (<10 km) to at-risk
areas. The occurrences in Zambia and northern Central African Republic lie, respectively, to the
south and north of previously predicted at-risk regions.
Figure 2 depicts the three new consolidated bat distributions. The revised distribution of the
Group 1 bats (i.e. those found to have been Ebolavirus RNA positive) is broadly consistent with that
published in the original paper except that the peripheries of Central Africa are now predicted to be
environmentally suitable for these bats, as well as some parts of East Africa, particularly Tanzania,
Mozambique and Madagascar. The Group 2 and Group 3 bat species are predicted to be distrib-
uted across much of Africa stretching from West to East Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as much of the
coastline of the continent.
The revised niche map, incorporating the updated bat covariates and disease occurrence data-
base, is presented in Figure 3. The map shows the predicted areas of environmental suitability for
zoonotic Ebola virus transmission to be consistent with previous attempts, but the relative environ-
mental suitability within this distribution differs from the previous estimates. Figure 3—figure sup-
plement 1 demonstrates that Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo and mainland Equatorial
Guinea are now predicted to be more environmentally suitable than in the previous analysis. The
regions of Central Africa (particularly Gabon and the Republic of Congo) identified as being most
environmentally suitable for zoonotic EVD transmission in the previous analysis remain so in this anal-
ysis. The revised number of predicted at-risk countries, determined by thresholding the map by a
probability that captures 95% of the occurrence dataset, is 23 (Table 1).
The similar AUC values (0.85 ± 0.04 compared to 0.8236 ± 0.080) between the previous and cur-
rent iterations suggest that the updated model fits the new occurrence dataset as well as the previ-
ous model fitted the older dataset. Mean enhanced vegetation index (EVI) remains the highest
relative predictor covariate for zoonotic EVD transmission while the relative importance of Group 1
bat distributions moved from being the fifth most important to the second. Mean night-time land
surface temperature (LST), elevation and mean daytime LST complete the top five predictors
(Table 2).
When separate bat layers were used in the model, as opposed to the consolidated covariates,
the predictions were geographically similar (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) however, four bat spe-
cies were identified as explaining more of the variation than the rest; Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epo-
mops franqueti (from both of which Ebolavirus RNA has been isolated), Otomops martiensseni and
Epomophorus labiatus (both from Group 3). The explanatory power of this model (evaluated using
AUC) was comparable to the model results described above (AUC = 0.819 ± 0.080).
Discussion
This research advance integrates new data as well as a more thorough consideration of the bat spe-
cies that act as a reservoir for the virus in order to update our modelled estimate of the zoonotic

 niche of EVD. The area estimated to be at potential risk of zoonotic EVD transmission has now
expanded to include Kenya and the influence of additional bat species demonstrates that continued
focus should be placed on rigorously identifying reservoir species and the role they play in sustaining
viral transmission (Leendertz, 2016). The fact that O. martiensseni and E. labiatus contribute explan-
atory power to the model, in comparison with their distributions on the eastern and southern periph-
ery of reported cases of EVD (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) suggests that different regions of the
continent may support transmission cycles with differing reservoir species. This, coupled with the
potential for each of the pathogenic species of Ebolavirus potentially having differing distributions
(Peterson et al., 2004), cannot currently be explored more rigorously due to insufficient data.

 As with the original publication, it must be reiterated that environmental suitability does not inevi-
tably lead to spillover events. Currently absolute human population residing in at-risk pixels is used
as a proxy for spillover likelihood, however, a variety of factors will influence the outbreak risk within
each location (Plowright et al., 2015) and only by including covariates that consider human behav-
iour (Woldehanna and Zimicki, 2015), patterns of susceptibility in other animals (Walsh et al.,

dynamics (Amman et al., 2012; Hayman, 2015) can an approximation of spillover risk be defined.
These updates demonstrate the ease and speed with which new data and covariate considera-
tions can be incorporated within existing empirical models (Kraemer et al., 2016). As the wider dis-
cussion on EVD turns to focus on strategies to prevent or contain future spillover events as well as
developing long-term in-country containment capacities (Currie et al., 2016), it is hoped that maps

 such as these convey the heterogeneities in spillover risk that exist within Africa. To better enable
researchers and policymakers to consider EVD preparedness and necessary contingencies, a new
online tool has been developed which allows users to interrogate the revised maps in more detail, in
areas of specific interest (http://vizhub.healthdata.org/ebola). As part of this tool, the zoonotic niche
output and Group 1 bat layers are now available, along with filters for identifying at-risk countries
and locations of previous index cases from outbreaks.
Geographic datasets such as these provide context to broader discussions as our aspirations tran-
sition from controlling outbreaks to mitigating the risk of future spillover events prioritised by their
potential for more widespread epidemics. Such data are particularly important for determining
where best to investigate the frequency of potentially transmissible contacts between reservoir and
susceptible species and humans. Previous niche maps served as an important impetus in the search
for potential reservoirs (Peterson et al., 2004) and these iterations can continue to inform such
work. As researchers and policy makers seek to resolve outstanding questions about EVD epidemiol-
ogy, it is hoped that the continued updating and dissemination of this information can contribute to
this discussion.
Materials and methods
Updating the occurrence database
Since the previous publication, an outbreak of EVD occurred in humans in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (Maganga et al., 2014). The outbreak is thought to have originated in Inkanamongo,
a village near Boende, E
´ quateur province and resulted in 66 probable and confirmed cases and 49
probable and confirmed deaths (Rosello et al., 2015). A polygon of radius 10 km centered on the
town of Boende was included to capture the location of the index case, increasing the database of
assumed independent animal-to-human spillover events to 31 as part of 24 distinct reported out-
breaks (Mylne et al., 2014).
In addition, a re-analysis of the literature available on infections in animal species was completed
on 7th October 2015. Due to the poor differential capacity of immunological tests to discriminate
Ebola virus from other viruses we retained the following inclusion criteria for the database; for sus-
ceptible species mortality events linked to Ebolavirus by any diagnostic methodology or PCR-posi-
tive diagnosis of Ebolavirus were included. Inclusion criteria for potential bat reservoir species were
either PCR-positivity or serological evidence suggesting Ebolavirus infection. Serological studies
were included without fatal outcomes (unlike with susceptible species) due to the hypothesised
asymptomatic nature of infection in the reservoir hosts. As a result of these inclusion criteria, studies
with serological detection of Ebolavirus in healthy non-Chiropteran species were excluded, such as
surveys in dogs (Allela et al., 2005).
In total six new records of EVD occurrence in animals were identified and included within the
database to increase the total to 57. These records were obtained from two research articles. The
first of these assessed Ebolavirus load in a variety of mammal species and identified PCR-positivity in
a number of small mammals across three sites in Central African Republic (Morvan et al., 1999). In
total, four separate occurrences, consisting of three different species, were identified as being PCR
positive: a member of the Praomys complex, Peter’s mouse (Mus setulosus) and the greater forest
shrew (Sylvisorex ollula). The second study investigated serological responses in straw-coloured fruit
bats (Eidolon helvum) caught in two districts in Zambia (Ogawa et al., 2015). Specific latitudes and
longitudes of the study sites were supplied for the Central African Republic study and were used to
generate point occurrences. For the Zambian study it was necessary to use administrative data rep-
resenting the two districts where the bats were caught (Serenje and Ndola districts).
Expanding potential bat reservoir species
Potential bat reservoir species were stratified into three groupings based upon the strength of evi-
dence suggesting their reservoir status (Table 3). Group 1 contained the three species of bat from
which Ebolavirus RNA has been detected and therefore have the strongest evidence to support
potential reservoir status (Leroy et al., 2005). Group 2 species are those that, using a variety of
serological tests, have been reported to be Ebolavirus seropositive, suggesting potential reservoir
status. A previous review (Olival and Hayman, 2014), identified nine species as seropositive for

 Ebolavirus. This was reduced to five species after the removal of the three species already categor-
ised in Group 1 and Leschenault’s Rousette, Rousettus leschenaultii, which is not found in Africa.
Finally, Group 3 species were identified via generalized boosted regression analysis, which dis-
criminates the bats reported to be filovirus-positive by learning trait patterns that distinguish them
from all other bat species (Han et al., 2016). Generalized boosted regression (Elith et al., 2008)
was applied to traits describing all bat species, including life history, physiological, ecological, mor-
phological and demographic variables collected from numerous published sources. In addition to
traits, the filovirus status of each bat species was assigned as a binary score (0 – not currently known
to be positive for any filoviruses; 1 – published evidence). This analysis produces a rank list of all bat
species according to their probability of being a filovirus carrier on the basis of their trait similarities
with known filovirus-positive bat species. Bats found in the 90th percentile of likely filovirus carriers
were initially considered, and then filtered to include only those which have home ranges in Africa
(Schipper et al., 2008). As per the original publication, occurrence records were extracted from the
Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Species for which there were fewer than 20 unique
GBIF records in Africa were dropped from the analysis due to data paucity. Table 3 reports the bat
species and corresponding numbers of occurrences included in the analysis.
For Group 1 species, occurrence records were supplemented by searching PubMed and Web of
Knowledge for additional reports. A literature review was completed on the 8th September 2015
using the following sets of keywords:

A total of 34 articles were identified for inclusion, from which 564 additional occurrences were
sourced.
All bat species were modelled separately using boosted regression trees (Elith et al., 2008) utilis-
ing the same modelling procedure as outlined in the original article except that 100, rather than 50,
bootstrap models were fitted. This resulted in 15 individual environmental suitability maps for bat
species (see Figure 2—figure supplements 1, 2 and 3), as well as three consolidated bat layers
combining the environmental suitability maps for the bats within each of the three groupings
(Figure 2).
Revising the predicted zoonotic niche map
A species distribution model, specifically a boosted regression trees approach (Elith et al., 2008),
was implemented. The model generates regression trees based upon binary splits of linked covari-
ates, which are iteratively improved upon by boosting. The regression trees are capable of charac-
terising complex environmental interactions and correlations since each tree is built from a hierarchy
of multiple nodes, each based upon different successive binary splits of the covariates. The model
extracts environmental information for each reported occurrence of Ebolavirus to define an optimal
relationship between presence of the disease and environmental factors. Predictive performance is
improved by including a comparison background dataset that acts as a hypothesised environmental
negative control (Phillips et al., 2009). As per the previous analysis, this dataset was generated by
randomly sampling across Africa biased towards areas of high population density. By including
human population density in this way, some potential sampling biases present in human index case
reporting can be mitigated as cases are more likely to be reported in more populous areas. The
boosted regression trees were re-run using the same parameters and covariates (elevation, mean
evapotranspiration rate, and mean and range measures of enhanced vegetation index, daytime land
surface temperature (LST), and night-time LST) as the previous publication except for the inclusion
of the new occurrence data outlined above and the new bat layers. Two model iterations were run:
one with the three consolidated bat layers (i.e. Groups 1, 2 and 3) and the other with all the bat spe-
cies layers considered separately.
Estimating populations at risk
The continuous suitability surface was converted into a binary at-risk versus not-at-risk surface by
determining a threshold value that included 95% of the estimated suitability values of pixels with
reported human index cases (Pigott et al., 2015). For sites represented by a specific latitude and
longitude the suitability score was taken from the corresponding pixel; for polygon estimates cover-
ing a number of cells, the mean suitability was taken across all pixels covered by the polygon.
Whilst not included directly as a covariate in the modelling process, human population layers
were assessed in at-risk locations as a potential proxy for spillover frequency. The populations living
within the gridded cells thought to be at-risk of potential Ebolavirus transmission from zoonotic sour-
ces
were
