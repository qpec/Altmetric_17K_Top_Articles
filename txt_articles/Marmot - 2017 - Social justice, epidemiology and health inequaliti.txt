Abstract A lifetime spent studying how social determi-
nants of health lead to health inequalities has clarified
many issues. First is that social stratification is an appro-
priate topic of study for epidemiologists. To ignore it
would be to ignore a major source of variation in health in
society. Not only is the social gradient in health appropriate
to study but we have made progress both in understanding
its causes and what can be done to address them. Post-
modern ‘critical theory’ raises questions about the social
construction of science. Given the attack on science by
politicians of bad faith, it is important to recognise that
epidemiology and public health have a crucial role to play
in providing evidence to improve health of society and
reduce inequalities. Evidence gives grounds for optimism
that progress can be made both in improving the health of
the worst-off in society and narrowing health inequalities.
Theoretical debates about ‘inequality of what’ have been
helpful in clarifying theories that drive further gathering of
evidence. While it is important to consider alternative
explanations of the social gradient in health—principal
among them reverse causation—evidence strongly supports
social causation. Social action is by its nature political. It
is, though, a vital function to provide the evidence that
underpins action.

I was walking in the Mall in Washington DC. For Euro-
peans, that is the area of DC that was sparsely populated
during Donald Trump’s inauguration as US President—
much to his chagrin and child-like attempts to lie about
what was evident in plain view. In the section devoted to
Martin Luther King Jr., I found this quote of his, King’s not
Trump’s:
I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love
will have the final word in reality. This is why right,
temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.
As chair, I had been telling members of the Commission on
Equity and Health Inequalities in the Americas, sponsored
by the Pan American Health Organisation, that we needed
‘evidence-based policies presented in a spirit of social
justice’. ‘Unarmed truth and unconditional love’, perhaps,
is a more eloquent way of saying the same thing.
Parenthetically, the Commissioners include distinguished
lawyers, specialists in health diplomacy, health care
administration, women’s health, the rights of indigenous
people and a former US Surgeon-General, David Satcher.
Apart from me, probably only one member of the
Commission, would answer to the call: epidemiologist.
What, you might ask, is an epidemiologist doing with such
activities and in such company. You might ask, too, if the
evidence in my ‘evidence-based policies’ would pass the
epidemiology quality test.

 Burns, and me. One Scottish MP, having listened to my
evidence, asked me:
‘What would you do if you were Chancellor of the
Exchequer (UK Minister of Finance)?’
My response: ‘I know how lucky I am, but the people of
Britain don’t know how lucky they are, that I am not the
Chancellor. But what I would say to the Chancellor is that
he should take no action that is likely to make health
inequalities worse. Predictably, his changes to the tax and
benefit system will increase the number of children grow-
ing up in poverty. Other things equal, that will have an
adverse impact on health inequalities.’
I claim that I have the evidence to support such a statement
but it bears little resemblance to what we teach students in
epidemiology method classes. The argument runs like this.
Evidence shows there is a gradient in the quality of early
child development—the lower the socioeconomic position
the worse do children perform on standard tests of cognitive,
linguistic, social, emotional and behavioural development
[1]. Much of this can be accounted for statistically by par-
enting activities [2]. The social gradient in early child
development can be reduced by two strategies: reducing child
poverty and by providing support for parents and families.
Readiness for school predicts school performance [3].
Achieved educational level is strongly correlated with adult
health and hence is a potent predictor of health inequalities.
Such effects may be a direct consequence of education or
may arise because education is associated with income, type
of work, living conditions and psychological processes which
are associated with health. Further, adverse child experiences
are more frequent the lower the socio-economic position of
parents. And adverse child experiences are linked with many
predictors of adverse health outcomes: smoking, drug use,
under-age sex and teenage pregnancy, domestic violence,
mental illness and possibly physical illness.
What I do not have is a randomised controlled trial that
shows that a reduction in child poverty now will reduce
health inequalities when today’s children are older adults,
sixty plus years from now. Such is not the nature of the
evidence on health inequalities.
I have been concerned, nay obsessed, with social
inequalities in health: how we understand the causes of the
social gradient in health; and how action on the social
determinants of health could improve population health
and reduce avoidable health inequalities.
I have toiled happily in this vineyard for more than four
decades. In the early years it was ‘‘pure’’ research. But
yesterday’s pure research became today’s applied research
and, increasingly, research aimed at understanding became
enmeshed with efforts aimed at policy and practice. In this
essay, I want to deal with issues with which I have wrestled
along the way.
Should ‘‘social class’’ be a proper concern
of epidemiologists?
The answer for some is a clear no. Too vague and ill-defined,
too freighted with political baggage, not an area for scientific
enquiry. In this view, epidemiology, in investigating causa-
tion, should be about establishing exposure-disease rela-
tionships, not lamenting the ills of society. Poverty is
lamentable and may be bad for health but let’s stick with
more proximate causes that can be defined and measured.
PM 2.5 can be measured, so can smoking and drinking and,
with somewhat less precision, dietary intake; better still are
biomarkers or SNPs. But poverty? It will mean something
different in Zambia than it will in Glasgow; something dif-
ferent in 1950 from what it means in 2020. What does it
mean, then, to be studying poverty and health? Or, when
studying the social gradient in health, as I do, being in the
middle of the socioeconomic hierarchy will have different
implications in Kolkata than it will in Berlin.
Further, if the chain of reasoning that I laid out in the
Introduction is the best I can do, it falls so far short of
establishing causation, it gives the whole enterprise a bad
name.
My response: look at the data. Figure 1 is an updated
version of Fig. 1 from Fair Society Healthy Lives, the
Marmot Review of Health Inequalities in England (1), that
I reproduced at the beginning of my book, The Health Gap
[4]. It plots life expectancy and disability-free life expec-
tancy for neighbourhoods in England classified by neigh-
bourhood
deprivation.
There
is
a
remarkable
social
gradient: the more deprived the neighbourhood the worse
the health. The gradient is steeper for healthy life than it is
for expected length of life. Much of the scatter around the
line is reduced if we produce a family of plots such as that
in Fig. 1, one for each region of England. It is worse for
your health to be socially disadvantaged in the North of
England than it is in the South-East.
For the Marmot Review, we calculated that if everyone
in England had the same death rates as the most advan-
taged, a total of between 1.3 and 2.5 million extra life years
would be enjoyed by those dying prematurely each year.
They would in addition have had a further 2.8 million years
free of disability. Or, to put it slightly differently, if
everyone in England had a mortality rate as low as those
with university education, there would be 202,000 fewer
deaths each year of people aged 30 and above.
We see gradients such as this in most countries for
which data are available. And where the data are not
available for adult health, we see gradients for under five
mortality by household wealth [5].
To ignore the social gradient in health because you think
that socioeconomic position, or degrees of deprivation, are
538

 vague round the edges, or because concern with health
inequalities is politically motivated, is to ignore a major
problem in health for all societies. Ah, might my critic
respond, but is the link between education, or deprivation,
and health causal, and, if so, what can we do about it.
Answering those two questions is what I have been doing
these last 40 years. The WHO Commission on Social
Determinants of Health was, for me as chair, an important
weigh station [6], and our European Review of Social
Determinants and the Health Divide another [7]. Particu-
larly with the surge in interest in many countries in the last
few years [8] I have little doubt that we are making pro-
gress on both fronts—research and action.
Note that investigating health inequalities does not
ignore research investigating whether exposure a is cau-
sally linked to health outcome b. In part, work on health
inequalities depends on demonstration of such causes. I
adopted Geoffrey Rose’s simple phrase, the causes of the
causes [9]. Smoking is a cause of ill-health but why do
smoking and other unhealthy behaviours follow the social
gradient—what is the cause of the cause. Exposure to high
levels of PM2.5 is a cause of ill-health, but why are people
lower in the social hierarchy more likely to be exposed—
the cause of the cause.
If looking for causal intermediaries between position on
the hierarchy and ill-health takes us downstream, then
looking for the causes of the causes needs to take us
upstream into the nature of society that leads to, and toler-
ates, stark inequalities in conditions of daily life; and
inequities in power, money and resources that give rise to
these inequalities in conditions in which people are born,
grow, live, work and age—language that we used in the
report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health.
A further word on language is necessary. For good or ill,
those of us concerned with social inequalities in health
have stopped using the term ‘‘social class’’. It has baggage
and multiple meanings. Do we mean Marx’s two great
classes, bourgeoisie and proletariat—where ownership, or
not, of the means of production is key? Or perhaps the
linked Weberian concept of a category of men who have in
common a component of their life chances? Or an Erikson-
Goldthorpe notion of span of control at work? People using
the term ‘‘social class’’ might mean or all or some of these.
It is unclear.
We’ve also stopped using the term SES, socioeconomic
status, because it implies that differences in health between
social groups can all be attributed to differences in status.
Full disclosure, I contributed a little to the confusion by
writing a book with the title, Status Syndrome [10] which
actually said little about ‘status’ and health. It said much
more about how lower social position was linked to low
control over life and less opportunity for social participa-
tion than it did about perceived status. That said, there is
evidence that perceived status may be important [11].

 More common now is to use the neutral-sounding term,
socioeconomic position. It makes no judgement as to the
theoretical basis of the classification—a mixed blessing.
No doubt, in time, it too will take on baggage. But for the
moment it serves to classify individuals along a social
gradient and allows investigation both of how they got
there, and the health consequences of being there: causes of
the causes of the causes.
Positivist?
As always, discussions about language are really discus-
sions
about
ideas.
When
I
first
started
researching
socioeconomic differences in health, two common terms
of abuse from social scientists were ‘positivist’, and
‘atheoretical’. If positivism means focussing purely on
empirical observations and ignoring the ideology and
structures of knowledge that we bring to our studies then
such critique surely has merit. But beware. If so-called
‘critical theory’ leads to a post-modern questioning of the
very possibility of objective truth, then in an age of
Donald Trump where there are facts and ‘alternative
facts’, where ‘truth’ is whatever feels convenient and best
serves political advantage, where global warming is a
hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, we are in grave danger
[12]. For example, destitution is bad for health. Post-
modern critical theorists may call both ‘destitution’ and
‘health’ social constructions, and question the methods we
use to establish a link between the two. But if men in a
deprived part of London have life expectancy 18 years
shorter than men in a rich part, that is a fact that should
claim our attention, stimulate research, and inspire calls
for action.
To put it more plainly, scholars and political activists
with good motivation—critiquing the very nature of our
knowledge, and showing how science is part of power
structures—play into the hands of political charlatans,
whose motivation is much more sinister. When Trump
says that the murder rate in the US is at an all-time high,
he is not being post-modern, he is lying. The murder rate
is near to an all-time low. He is lying to make a political
point—in his inaugural address he spoke of ‘carnage’.
During the 2016 US election campaign, when official
figures said that unemployment under the last year of the
Obama Presidency was around 5%, Trump said it was
fake and claimed that the real figure was five, six, eight
times that. When Trump was President, and the unem-
ployment was still at around 5% he took credit for
reducing it. His spokesman quoted the President as say-
ing, the figures were fake then; they are real now.
Hahaha! That laugh sent shivers up and down many
spines. Golly, how funny that you can mess around with
official figures at will. The planet warming? Nah. A
conspiracy of left-wing scientists.
Facts matter.
Atheoretical?
As for being ‘atheoretical’, initially I was somewhat defi-
ant. I said I didn’t care much whether the social gradient
was predicted by education, deprivation of the area or, in
the case of my Whitehall studies, grade of employment
[13, 14]. The fact was that each of them showed health to
follow a social gradient. The question was why.
The theories that I find useful now perhaps are not very
grand or high level, but they are indispensable. First, Max
Weber thought of social stratification not so much as a
characteristic of a person, their status for example, but a
characteristic of society. We can measure individuals’
social position but that should not blind us to the fact that
societies differ in their degrees of inequality.
Second, and related, in the Commission on Social
Determinants of Health we explicitly drew attention to
what we called the structural drivers of health inequalities:
inequities in power, money and resources. These are fea-
tures of societies not simply of individuals within those
societies. It draws heavily on Weber. Drawing on an old,
but still fresh text of Mervyn Susser [15], we need to get
the level of analysis right. We measure individual socioe-
conomic position and examine the extent to which its link
with health can be ‘explained’ statistically by smoking, or
other risk factors. But that won’t tell us whether democ-
racy, respect for human rights and socially inclusive soci-
eties are good for health. We need, at least conceptually, a
different level of causal thinking for that.
Third, I have spent decades wondering which is more
important: relative or absolute poverty. I am not alone.
Peter Townsend and Amartya Sen tussled with this and
each other three decades ago [16, 17]. In a low-income
country, there is little difficulty in seeing how absolute
poverty damages health. Even in a high-income country, if
people low in the hierarchy have insufficient money to buy
food and pay rent, absolute poverty must be important. But
the social gradient surely implies relative poverty. Even
here it could be questioned. The gradient shown in Fig. 1
could arise if richer areas simply had fewer people in
absolute poverty. That could not, however, readily account
for the gradient in health by level of education. The latter
implies relative disadvantage.
Amartya Sen solved it by arguing that relative depri-
vation with respect to income corresponded to absolute
deprivation with respect to capabilities [18]. My way of
putting this is that it is not so much what you have that is
important for health, but what you can do with what you
540

 have [4]. A family in a low income area of Baltimore
Maryland has a median household income of $17,000. By
US standards, this is poverty. Yet, on a global scale they
are fantastically rich. Gross National Income per capita,
adjusting for purchasing power, in Costa Rica is $14,000.
Life expectancy for men in Costa Rica is 77; in the poor
part of Baltimore 62. The poor of Baltimore may be rich
compared to the Costa Rican average but they are poor
relative to the US and that translates into absolute disad-
vantage. In the poor part of Baltimore life chances are
sorely diminished: single parent families, low levels of
education, high probability of arrest by the age of 17, high
probability of being shot. It is not so much what they have
but what they can do with what they have; and that will
depend on the nature of society.
Sen’s ‘capabilities’ are linked to his basic notion of
freedom to lead a life one has reason to value [19]. Before I
knew of Amartya Sen, building on the work of Karasek and
Theorell [20], I had shown in the Whitehall II study that
low control at work provided a partial explanation of the
social gradient in health [21]. Sen’s freedom and capabil-
ities gave me the impetus to generalise. In the Commission
on Social Determinants of Health we put empowerment at
the heart of what we were trying to achieve: material,
psychosocial and political.
If theory is a way of organising one’s thoughts, an
explanation of how the world works, and thus an aid to
understanding and a guide to action, then the charge of
being atheoretical is one to take seriously. If not a theory,
then at least a model. Figure 2 was developed for the
Commission on Social Determinants of Health [22]. It
illustrates the multi-level nature of our thinking. Assem-
bling the evidence to support this model is, of course, a
major challenge.
Parenthetically, I have never described myself as a
‘social epidemiologist’, although others might. I am con-
cerned at the health of populations and inequalities in
health. The evidence takes me in the direction of looking at
how society impacts on health. That said, I feel a sense of
kinship and shared orientation with those who have carved
out the discipline of social epidemiology [23].
But why do you need to look at inequalities? Take
action on the causes and everyone’s health
improves
This argument, too, has merit. Dirty water leads to pre-
ventable illness. Clean up the water supply and everyone
benefits. You don’t need to lament that poor people were
less likely to have access to improved water supply, and
that this contributed to inequality. Simply do it for
everybody.
Similarly with non-communicable diseases. If smoking
rates decline everyone benefits. There may even be a
reduction in inequality because smoking-related diseases
follow the social gradient, more common lower down.
Look again at Fig. 1, however. It plots the gradient for

 decade, a welcome societal achievement. When I protest,
but what about inequalities, the response has been: What
are you? Some kind of naı
¨ve egalitarian? Go home, lie
down and get over it.
As Fig. 1 shows, at the same time health improved for
everyone, the gradient did not change. We need to have
two societal goals: improve health for everyone and reduce
inequalities.
One way of thinking about this is the trade-off between
efficiency
and
equity.
For
example,
when
Manolis
Kogevinas worked with me years ago, he showed that for
many cancer sites, people of low socioeconomic position
had worse survival than those of high position [24]. One
possibility is that the poor have less favourable response to
treatment. There are other explanations—later presenta-
tion, worse access to treatment, less compliance—but let’s
stay with biological differences for the moment. For effi-
ciency, greatest health gain for a given quantum of effort
and expenditure, focus on the more advantaged group.
Forget the poor. Equity, of course, directs one in a different
direction. But then, it is crucial to make sure that inter-
ventions achieve the desired health improvements. If the
intervention is ineffective, equity is little served. The
challenge is not to withhold benefits from the rich, but to
reduce inequalities at the same time as benefitting the
whole population.
The poor are always with us
In all societies there will be the poor, relatively and
absolutely. More accurately, all societies have social and
economic inequalities. If the health gradient arises because
of these inequalities won’t there always be health inequi-
ties? In which case shouldn’t we stick with the one goal,
improving health for everybody, and forget the second one
of reducing inequalities.
I have two answers. First, look again at the two curves
showing the gradient in life expectancy in Fig. 1, and focus
not on the extremes but on people towards the top and
those below the middle. In the earlier period, 1999–2003,
life expectancy of men in affluent areas, at the 80th centile,
was around 78, and for men in more deprived areas, the
30th centile, was 74. Ten years later life expectancy in the
somewhat deprived areas at the 30th centile had increased
to 78. The health of the poorly off in 2010 is as good as that
of the well-off ten years earlier.
In 2000 if, contemplating the social gradient in health,
we had said that we could get the health of people near the
bottom of the social gradient up to that of people near the
top, it would be hailed as a major boon to the disadvantaged
members of society. It was done. It just took ten years. The
hitch, of course, was that in that time health for those near
the top had improved, too. The lesson I take from this is that
if the health of the poor can be improved quickly, then there
is nothing fixed about inequalities in health. The fact that
the slope of the health gradient did not change despite
overall improvements in health suggests we need to look
upstream to social determinants of health inequity.
My second answer to ‘‘the poor are always with us’’
argument is that all societies do have social gradients in
health but the slope varies. In the context of a European
Review of health inequalities [25], we looked at life
expectancy at age 25 by education in 15 different countries
[26]. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe had low
average life expectancy and big inequalities. Sweden,
Norway, and Mediterranean countries had long average life
expectancy and smaller inequalities. We need to move
from an Estonian and Hungarian level of health inequity to
a Nordic or Mediterranean level.
In the English Review we coined the term proportionate
universalism. We were, I am, convinced by the evidence
that one of the secrets to good health in Nordic countries is
a commitment to universalism [27]. In Anglo-Saxon
countries the default position in social policy is to focus on
the worst-off. Proportionate universalism is our effort at
combining these two approaches. We want universalist
policies that include everyone, but effort has to be pro-
portionate to need.
Inequality of what?
A much-used measure of income inequality in economics
is the Gini coefficient. It measures how far the income
distribution of individuals strays from the line of equality:
1% of the population having 1% of the total income; 20%
of the population having 20%; 90% having 90%. Inequal-
ity, here, applies to individuals. It turns out that when
economists use the term ‘inequality’ they do mean the
variability among individuals, the total variance. When we
refer to inequality in public health, certainly in the UK, we
mean variability among social groups. The first thing, then,
is to get the language straight so that we can communicate.
But, as above, a linguistic issue is commonly an ideo-
logical issue. When we published the report of the Com-
mission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) in 2008,
I was asked to make a presentation about it at the London
School of Economics (LSE)—one of the jewels in the
crown of British Universities. A distinguished economist,
invited to comment on the report, observed that for every
mention of individual differences in health, there were
n mentions of social inequalities, where n was a large
number. Well, of course, the name was on the cover. The
causes of individual differences in health may be different
542
M. Marmot
123
 from the causes of group differences. There may be over-
lap, but differences, too.
In the CSDH, we adopted the WHO usage that flows
from Dahlgren and Whitehead [28], and used ‘health
equity’ to refer to those systematic inequalities in health
between social groups that are judged to be avoidable by
reasonable means. If not avoided they are inequitable.
Hence our phrase that graced the cover of the CSDH
Report: ‘‘Social injustice is killing on a grand scale’’.
My own particular concern has been the social gradient
in health, defined by socioeconomic position, and the
importance of social determinants in leading to these health
inequities. A persistent question is what about racial/ethnic
differences in health. My starting position is that the same
set of social determinants are likely to account for the
differences in health between indigenous and non-indige-
nous people in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US
and elsewhere. Racism, discrimination and stigma will be
causes of unequal distributions of these social determinants
both between and within ethnic groups.
There is, of course, another crucial question when it
comes to ‘inequality of what?’ which I will touch on briefly:
equality of opportunity or equality of outcome [29]. If
politicians or social commentators are going to endorse any
principle of equality, equality of opportunity is the easiest.
It appeals to natural justice. In theory, every mother’s son
can be US President—harder for a daughter. In practice, the
conditions in which people are born and grow are so dra-
matically different that equality of opportunity is a chimera.
That said, politicians love to endorse equality of opportu-
nity to establish their commitment to fairness.
Health, though, is an outcome. As Fig. 2 shows it is the
outcome of a chain of social processes. Gaining commit-
ment to equality of outcomes is a different, and much more
difficult proposition. It will require a focus on outcomes
along the causal chain. For example, making sure there are
school places for all is a step towards equality of oppor-
tunity. But we should not stop there. We need to look at
outcomes. In all countries, there are social gradients in
performance on standard tests. They are shallow in Fin-
land, steep in the US. As a social goal, with health equity in
view, we should be seeking to reduce the social gradient in
school performance.
The mind is an important gateway by which
the social environment influences health and health
inequalities
In the beginning were Farr, Stevenson and Florence
Nightingale—statisticians who pioneered the study of
social determinants of health and health inequalities in
England. They begat Black [30]. Black begat Acheson
[31]. Acheson begat Marmot [1]. I am, of course, referring
to successive reports, commissioned by governments, on
health inequalities in England. In between was Whitehead
[32]. Her report was commissioned by the Health Educa-
tion Authority, but a Conservative government wanted to
refuse publication, and Penguin happily stepped in.
As a member of the Acheson Inquiry, I pushed strongly
that we should consider not just poverty and health, but the
gradient. Sir Donald Acheson said: but if we consider the
gradient, we will have to consider psychosocial influences
on health. Correct. And we did.
In my Marmot Review, psychosocial influences ran all
the way through our six domains of recommendations:
early child development, education, employment and
working conditions, having enough money to live on,
healthy environments in which to live and work, a social
determinants approach to prevention.
Briefly, there had been a vogue to contrast neo-material
influences on health with psychosocial influences and
belittle the latter [33]. I was never convinced [34]. Take,
for example, the fourth recommendation from Fair Society
Healthy Lives [1], everyone should have the minimum
income necessary for a health life. If one were contrasting
material or neo-material influences with psychosocial,
having insufficient money sounds rather ‘‘material’’. But
why does it damage health? Living in a cold home, for
example, is bad for respiratory health; it also has an
adverse effect on children’s mental health and school
performance. Parents in poverty are less likely to engage
in nurturing activities with their children. Mental illness
and alcohol problems are more frequent with poverty.
Why would you want to make such a sharp distinction
between material and psychosocial influences? There is
now much interesting work on the psychology of poverty
[35, 36].
In fact, psychosocial influences are important in social
determinants of health and health equity in at least four
ways. First, early child development and education set the
context for what happens through the rest of the life course;
they influence opportunities and choices, work and social
relationships. What are these if not processes in the mind.
Second, behaviours influence health: drug use, alcohol,
smoking, diet, exercises. Third, stress pathways to physical
disease are crucial. Fourth, mental illness is an important
consequence of social disadvantage.
A paper by Case and Deaton drew attention to the rise in
mortality in non-Hispanic whites, aged 45–54 in the
USA—the fewer the years of education the steeper the rise
[37]. The causes of death constituting this rise were: poi-
sonings due to drugs and alcohol, suicide and alcoholic
liver disease—all psychosocial. I would not stop there, but
ask what are the structural (neo-material) causes of this
epidemic of disempowerment.

 Causal arrows
Which way do the causal arrows go: from wealth to health,
or from health to wealth? I am slow to anger and with the
self-delusion that I am considerate of the opinions of oth-
ers. But my tolerance has been exercised by this debate. At
times, I have gone overboard and said: ALL the evidence
points to social conditions causing ill-health not ill-health
causing social conditions. That has to be an overstatement.
If ill-health stops someone working and family income
falls, the arrow is running from health to wealth. But we
should not stop there and ignore the evidence of social
causation, of the arrow running from wealth to health.
I once asked a senior economist, President of a
University, why it is that, as a group, economists have as a
starting point that the causal arrow goes from health to
wealth. The President said: because the equations are easier
to solve if you put income on the left-had side of the
equation and health on the right-hand side. Really?
Certainly, an economist that I collaborate with happily
told me that one of the effects of our collaboration is that
his students who formerly were taught that health is an
input to income and wealth are now taught that the arrow
can run both ways. I suppose that even a modest achieve-
ment is an achievement.
The implications of these views of the direction of the
arrows for policy are profound. The Journal Social Science
and Medicine commissioned 8 groups of authors to write
commentaries on the Marmot Review, Fair Society Heal-
thy Lives [1]. My colleagues and I were invited to respond
to these 8 commentaries. What follows, in this section, is
from our response in Social Science and Medicine [38].
Six of the commentaries are in little doubt that we have
enough evidence to take action on social determinants of
health; although all, like us, want a stronger evidence base.
The other two commentaries thought we had the model
wrong [39, 40]. Their starting position, like that of many
economists involved in the social determinants debate, is
that peoples’ health determines what happens to them. The
Review’s starting position was that what happens to people
has a cumulative effect throughout their life course, pro-
gressively affecting their health.
At the time, I had been reading Dickens’s, Hard Times. I
took a page on housing:
In the hardest working part of Coketown,… where
Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and
gases were bricked in… where the chimneys, for
want of air to make a draft, were built in an immense
variety of stunted and crooked shapes (pp. 65–66).
And then a description of working conditions in a northern
mill town:
all the melancholy-mad elephants, polished and oiled
up for the day’s monotony, were at their heavy
exercise again…. Every man was in the forest of
looms
where
Stephen
worked
to
the
crashing,
smashing, tearing piece of mechanism at which he
laboured.
Should we really assume, that these dark satanic mills and
airless places, rather than causing terrible illness and
shortened lives, selectively employed sick people and those
whose backgrounds accounted for all their subsequent
illness? That subsequent improvement in living and
working conditions, thus abating Victorian squalor, and
associated improvements in health were correlation not
causation? That while medical care improved health,
housing also got better, and the public health profession
mistook the improvement in housing and working condi-
tions for causes of improved health?
If proponents of this set of assumptions dropped their
guard for a moment and accepted the evidence that air
pollution, crowded living conditions, ghastly working
conditions were causes of ill-health in Victorian times why,
a priori, do they start from the position that living and
working conditions are not a cause of ill-health in the
twenty-first century? Why do they appear to assume that
Fig. 1 in the Review, reproduced above, linking neigh-
bourhood deprivation to disability-free life expectancy
could all be due to a remarkable ability of people to choose
places to live depending on their level of health—ill health
leads to neighbourhood income, in other words? Which of
their many coefficients proves that? At a regional level, it is
equally difficult to see how selection explains why the
social gradient is widest in the North East and narrowest in
the South West, as both regions have a history of out-
migration of those needing to find employment.
This disagreement between commentators is not just
about evidence. It is also about ideology. We think that the
health gradient in Fig. 1 is a powerful demonstration of the
graded relation between social and economic conditions
and health. We are chastised, by Canning and Bower, for
wanting a fairer society to put it right. Instead, they offer
the following:
The health gradient should be seen as a flashing alarm
that our health systems are failing to deliver cost
effective health care and a call to allocate health
sector resources more effectively.
Why should it? Where is the evidence for their counter
assertion? They are not being more rigorous about
causation than we are, as they claim. They simply have a
different starting position. This is ideology dressed up,
condescendingly, as methodological rigour. We would go
further. Given the vast research resources that have gone

 into evaluating medical interventions, the lack of clear
evidence that the main cause of the social gradient in health
is differential access to health care, may mean that, indeed,
it is not lack of health care that is the cause of the problem.
Not political enough…
The economists’ criticisms seem to be that, in part, our
science is clouded by political motivation. A different kind
of criticism is that I have not been political enough; that
indeed politics can be studied as a determinant of social
determinants of health. When we published the report of
the CSDH with ‘‘Social Injustice is Killing on a Grand
Scale’’ on the cover, Vicente Navarro praised the report
[41]. He then went on to chide us for not going far enough.
His view was that we know who the killers are. My
response was that we had reviewed the evidence on social
determinants of health. I was perfectly content if others
wanted to take it to a more overtly political level. We went
so far as to say that health inequalities resulted from a toxic
combination of poor quality social programmes, unfair
economic arrangements and poor governance—and gave
the evidence to support those contentions.
A related challenge to us was: ‘‘Isn’t the problem really
capitalism’’. My response to this, too, is likely to disap-
point. I point out that the countries with the best health,
longest life expectancy, are Japan, Iceland, Sweden, and
now Hong Kong—all capitalist countries. Evidence would
suggest that it is not so much capitalism, per se, that is the
problem but how particular capitalist societies are oper-
ated. Runaway inequalities may be a feature of the US and
UK; much less so, Germany and France, let alone the
Nordic countries.
… but social enough
I have spent the majority of my academic life as a
researcher, much of it on the social determinants of health.
But something happened. I started wagging my finger.
With growth in the quantity and quality of evidence on
social determinants of health, I became more strongly of
the view that failure to take action on avoidable health
inequalities was unjust. If we know what to do, and we
don’t do it, society is at fault. Hence my wandering in the
Mall and being entranced by quotes from Martin Luther
King Jr. I know the argument. The more we become
committed to a position the less objective becomes our
science.
I was once asked by a BBC Radio Interviewer: Why
should I believe you? Perhaps you are cherry-picking the
evidence to support your view point.
It was an astute question. I responded that, as with
every
scientist,
I
was
committed
to
my
theories,
hypotheses and evidence. But the nature of science is that
if we are wrong, we are shown to be wrong. If a scientist
doesn’t modify his views in response to counter-evidence
he becomes irrelevant. Sometimes it may take a while, but
it happens.
I began this essay in the Washington Mall with Martin
Luther King. On the way, I indulged in a diatribe about the
importance of facts. When we published my English
Review, Fair Society Healthy Lives, in my note from the
chair, I referred to the fact that the CSDH had been criti-
cised by one country representative as ‘ideology with
evidence’. I said that we do have an ideology. Health
inequalities that are avoidable and are not avoided are
unjust. Putting them right is a matter of social justice. But
the evidence really matters.

justice.
