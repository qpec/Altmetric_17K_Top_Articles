BACKGROUND
After a single-center trial and observational studies suggesting that early, goal-
directed therapy (EGDT) reduced mortality from septic shock, three multicenter 
trials (ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe) showed no benefit. This meta-analysis of 
individual patient data from the three recent trials was designed prospectively to 
improve statistical power and explore heterogeneity of treatment effect of EGDT.
METHODS
We harmonized entry criteria, intervention protocols, outcomes, resource-use 
measures, and data collection across the trials and specified all analyses before 
unblinding. After completion of the trials, we pooled data, excluding the protocol-
based standard-therapy group from the ProCESS trial, and resolved residual differ-
ences. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included 
1-year survival, organ support, and hospitalization costs. We tested for treatment-
by-subgroup interactions for 16 patient characteristics and 6 care-delivery charac-
teristics.
RESULTS
We studied 3723 patients at 138 hospitals in seven countries. Mortality at 90 days 
was similar for EGDT (462 of 1852 patients [24.9%]) and usual care (475 of 1871 
patients [25.4%]); the adjusted odds ratio was 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.82 
to 1.14; P 
= 
0.68). EGDT was associated with greater mean (±SD) use of intensive 
care (5.3±7.1 vs. 4.9±7.0 days, P 
= 
0.04) and cardiovascular support (1.9±3.7 vs. 
1.6±2.9 days, P 
= 
0.01) than was usual care; other outcomes did not differ signifi-
cantly, although average costs were higher with EGDT. Subgroup analyses showed 
no benefit from EGDT for patients with worse shock (higher serum lactate level, 
combined hypotension and hyperlactatemia, or higher predicted risk of death) or 
for hospitals with a lower propensity to use vasopressors or fluids during usual 
resuscitation.
CONCLUSIONS
In this meta-analysis of individual patient data, EGDT did not result in better 
outcomes than usual care and was associated with higher hospitalization costs 
across a broad range of patient and hospital characteristics. (Funded by the Na-
tional Institute of General Medical Sciences and others; PRISM ClinicalTrials.gov

I
n 2001, Rivers and colleagues report-
ed on a 263-patient, single-center, random-
ized, controlled trial of early, goal-directed 
therapy (EGDT) versus usual care in patients 
presenting with septic shock to an urban emer-
gency department in the United States.1 EGDT is 
a 6-hour resuscitation protocol for the adminis-
tration of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, ino-
tropes, and red-cell transfusion to achieve pre-
specified targets for arterial blood pressure, 
central venous pressure, central venous oxygen 
saturation, and hemoglobin level. EGDT reduced 
hospital mortality from 46.5% to 30.5%,1 prompt-
ing many institutions worldwide to adopt EGDT.2 
Three subsequent, government-funded, multi-
center, randomized, controlled trials from the 
United States (Protocolized Care for Early Septic 
Shock [ProCESS]),3 Australasia (Australasian Re-
suscitation in Sepsis Evaluation [ARISE]),4 and 
the United Kingdom (Protocolised Management 
in Sepsis [ProMISe])5 failed to show lower mor-
tality with EGDT than with usual care.
A meta-analysis combining the average re-
sults of the trials also indicated no overall bene-
fit from EGDT.6 There is considerable heteroge-
neity, however, in patients in whom septic shock 
develops and in usual care across hospitals; con-
sequently, important treatment effects in patient 
subgroups or particular settings may have been 
missed.7
A prospective meta-analysis of individual pa-
tient data would provide greater statistical power 
to identify subgroup effects. The ProCESS, ARISE, 
and ProMISe investigators therefore planned this 
prospective meta-analysis of individual patient 
data (called the Protocolized Resuscitation in 
Sepsis Meta-Analysis [PRISM] study) before en-
rollment of the first patient into the first trial 
and harmonized entry criteria, intervention pro-
tocols, outcomes, major resource-use measures, 
and data collection across the three trials.8 The 
goals of the current study were to use pooled 
data from the three trials to determine the effect 
of EGDT versus usual care on 90-day mortality 
and secondary clinical and economic outcomes 
and to compare the effects of EGDT across pre-
specified patient and care-delivery subgroups.
Methods
Study Design
All three trials evaluated the EGDT protocol, as 
described in the article by Rivers et al.1 Core 
aspects of best care, including early recognition 
of sepsis and prompt delivery of intravenous 
fluids and antimicrobial agents, were promoted 
in the EGDT groups and the usual-care groups 
and reinforced through trial eligibility criteria.
We published the statistical analysis plan and 
a priori hypotheses for the current study before 
unblinding of any results from the three trials 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02030158); the 
protocol is also available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org. Each trial supplied in-
dividual patient data after publication3-5 and after 
the trial-level meta-analysis.6 Before pooling data, 
we compared trial protocols, case-report forms, 
and data dictionaries to identify any recoding 
needed. We then provided a detailed data-set 
specification to each trial team to prepare the 
data file for pooling. After receipt of the data, 
we checked for missing or duplicate values and 
for consistency and plausibility, resolving data 
queries through direct consultation with each 
trial team before analysis. We did not reassess 
risk of bias because that had been performed for 
the trial-level meta-analysis.6
The final data-set specification is shown in 
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able at NEJM.org. The primary outcome measure 
was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary 
outcome measures were in-hospital and 28-day 
mortality; duration of survival to 1 year; dura-
tion of stay in the emergency department, inten-
sive care unit, and hospital; receipt and duration 
of invasive mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, 
and renal-replacement therapy; and costs and 
cost-effectiveness at 90 days.
Prespecified subgroups according to baseline 
patient characteristics were age, sex, severe co-
existing conditions (liver, respiratory, cardiovas-
cular, and renal conditions and immunocom-
promised state, all defined according to Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
[APACHE] II criteria), site of infection, and sever-
ity of illness. Severity of illness was operational-
ized in eight ways, according to eligibility crite-
ria met (refractory hypotension, hyperlactatemia, 
or both), serum lactate level, illness-severity score 
(APACHE II Acute Physiology Score [range, 0 to 
60, with higher scores indicating greater severity 
of illness] and APACHE II score [range, 0 to 71, 
with higher scores indicating greater severity of 
illness]), organ dysfunction (Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment score), treatment (invasive 
mechanical ventilation [yes or no] and vasopres-

sors [yes or no]), and risk of death (derived from 
a customized model; see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Prespecified subgroups according to 
care-delivery characteristics were time from 
emergency department presentation to random-
ization, time of randomization (weekday or week-
end and day or night), time from emergency 
department presentation to first administration 
of intravenous antimicrobial agents (available for 
the ProCESS and ARISE trials), and underlying 
intensity of care (derived from propensity mod-
els for the use of vasopressors or fluids during 
usual care; see the Supplementary Appendix).
The funders had no role in the design or con-
duct of the study, in the collection, analysis, or 
interpretation of the data, or in the writing of 
the manuscript or the decision to submit it for 
publication.
Statistical Analysis
The individual trials each had 80 to 90% power 
to detect an absolute difference in mortality of 
6.5 to 8.0 percentage points between the EGDT 
group and the usual-care group, under the as-
sumption of a baseline mortality of 24 to 40%, 
depending on the trial. Because this was a pro-
spective meta-analysis of individual patient data, 
the sample-size calculation was undertaken be-
fore the results of the individual trials were 
available. On the basis of a control event rate of 
25 to 35%, a statistical power of 80%, and a 
two-sided P value of 0.05 (with no allowance for 
heterogeneity of treatment effect or clustering of 
outcomes across trials), this study could detect 
an absolute between-group difference in 90-day 
mortality of 4 to 5 percentage points and an 
interaction effect (odds ratio) of approximately 
1.5 or 1.6 for a subgroup representing one half 
or one quarter of the total sample, respectively.
We conducted all analyses on an intention-to-
treat basis. We used one-stage, hierarchical re-
gression modeling (patients nested in sites nested 
in trials), with site as a random effect and trial 
as a fixed effect. We determined heterogeneity 
among trials by fitting a fixed interaction be-
tween treatment and trial. We analyzed binomial 
outcomes using hierarchical logistic regression, 
reported as odds ratios and 95% confidence in-
tervals; survival time (censored at 1 year) using 
hierarchical (shared frailty) Cox proportional-
hazards regression, reported as hazard ratios 
and 95% confidence intervals; and continuous 
outcomes using hierarchical linear regression, 
reported as differences in means and 95% con-
fidence intervals. We presented survival to 1 year 
using a Kaplan–Meier survival curve.
We performed a secondary analysis of the 
primary outcome using the same hierarchical 
regression structure with adjustment for pre-
specified baseline covariates of age, sex, last 
systolic blood pressure before randomization 
(<90 or ≥90 mm Hg), APACHE II score, and in-
vasive mechanical ventilation at randomization 
(yes or no). Analyses of binomial secondary out-
comes were adjusted for the same covariates. To 
determine heterogeneity between prespecified 
subgroups, we added fixed interaction terms 
between treatment and subgroup to the adjusted 
model for the primary outcome. To ascertain 
whether any variation in treatment effect across 
subgroups was consistent among the trials, we 
fitted three-way fixed interactions among trial, 
treatment, and subgroup. We analyzed continu-
ous subgroup variables by dividing the cohort 
into thirds.
Our cost-effectiveness analysis compared the 
outcomes and costs, from the health-services 
perspective, up to 90 days after randomization. 
We used the combined mortality but reported 
cost and cost-effectiveness estimates separately 
for each trial because the interpretation of pooled 
cost-effectiveness estimates is unclear when 
drawn from health care systems with different 
cost structures.9 The resource use for each pa-
tient was combined with trial-specific unit costs 
to report the incremental costs of EGDT versus 
usual care. We calculated quality-adjusted life-
years (QALYs) up to 90 days by combining sur-
vival time with quality-of-life scores from the 
EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) administered 
at 90 days in the ProMISe trial, using the area-
under-the-curve approach.10 We estimated incre-
mental costs and QALYs of EGDT versus usual 
care with a seemingly unrelated regression 
model,11 with trial as a fixed effect for costs. We 
report results for each trial overall and for the 
same prespecified subgroups as for the clinical 
outcomes. We report incremental net monetary 
benefits by valuing QALYs at recommended 
thresholds for a QALY gain and performed sen-
sitivity analyses to test the robustness of our 
results to alternative assumptions (see the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
All analyses were performed with the use of 
SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), or Stata 
software, version 11.2 (StataCorp), and a two-

was used for clinical outcomes because data 
were missing for less than 0.5% for all out-
comes; multiple imputation was used for miss-
ing quality-of-life scores. We did not adjust for 
multiple comparisons; with 22 planned subgroup

Results
Study Patients
From March 2008 through July 2014, the three 
trials enrolled 4211 patients at 138 hospitals in 
the United States (ProCESS); Australia, New Zea-
land, Finland, Hong Kong, and the Republic of 
Ireland (ARISE); and England (ProMISe). The 
448 patients randomly assigned to receive proto-
col-based standard therapy in the ProCESS trial 
were excluded from the current study, resulting 
in 3763 patients randomly assigned to either 
usual care (1892 patients) or EGDT (1871 patients). 
After the exclusion of patients who withdrew 
consent, underwent randomization in error, or 
were lost to follow-up at 90 days, 3723 patients 
(98.9%) were included in the primary analysis 
and 3511 (93.3%) were followed up to 1 year 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patient 
and care-delivery characteristics were well bal-
anced at baseline (Table 1, and Tables S2 and S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary Outcome
Mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly 
between the two groups. Death occurred in 462 
of 1852 patients (24.9%) in the EGDT group and 
in 475 of 1871 (25.4%) in the usual-care group 
(Table 2). The adjusted odds ratio was 0.97 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.14; P 
= 
0.68).

The incremental effect (difference in means) according to trial was as follows: ProCESS, 0.3 (95% CI, −0.1 to 0.7); ARISE, −0.6 (95% CI, −0.9 to −0.3); and ProMISe, 0.2 (95% CI, 0.0 to 0.4).

The incremental effect (adjusted odds ratio) according to trial was as follows: ProCESS, 1.51 (95% CI, 1.12 to 2.04); ARISE, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.23); and ProMISe, 0.98 (95% CI, 
0.76 to 1.26).
††  
Missing data were multiply imputed.
‡‡  
Quality of life was assessed with the use of the EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L; a score of 0 indicates death and 1 perfect quality of life), which was administered to eligible patients 
in the ProMISe trial at 90 days after randomization. For all patients in the ProCESS and ARISE trials and those in the ProMISe trial who did not complete an EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, 
we used all available covariate information to estimate each patient’s quality-of-life score with multiple imputation.
§§  
The incremental net benefit was calculated by multiplying the QALY gain (or loss) by $100,000 and subtracting from this the incremental cost.

There was no interaction with respect to treat-
ment effect among the trials.
Secondary Outcomes
Duration of stay in the intensive care unit (first 
admission and total days) and receipt of cardio-
vascular support (both percentage of patients 
and duration) were greater in the EGDT group 
than the usual-care group (Table 2). No other 
secondary outcomes differed significantly. Du-
ration of stay in the emergency department was 
shorter in the EGDT group than in the usual-
care group in the ARISE trial but not in the 
ProCESS or ProMISe trials. There was no sig-
nificant difference in the duration of survival to 
1 year between the two groups (hazard ratio, 
0.98; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.11; P 
= 
0.75) (Fig. 1).
Subgroup Analyses
Of the 16 a priori patient characteristics evalu-
ated in subgroup analyses (Fig. 2), only 2 had 
significant interactions. In particular, there was 
no evidence of benefit associated with EGDT in 
the subgroups with the most severe septic 
shock, including those with a serum lactate level 
of 4.1 mmol per liter or more (1796 of 3258 pa-
tients [55.1%]; mean, 6.7 mmol per liter), those 
who presented with both hypotension and hyper-
lactatemia (628 of 3720 patients [16.9%]; mean 
systolic blood pressure, 89 mm Hg; mean serum 
lactate level, 6.7 mmol per liter), those in the 
upper third of APACHE II scores (1217 of 3723 
patients [32.7%]; mean score, 24.6), and those in 
the upper third of predicted risk of death (1227 
of 3715 patients [33.0%]; 90-day mortality, 
46.2%). EGDT was associated with higher mor-
tality among patients with severe chronic liver 
disease (117 of 3720 patients [3.1%]) than 
among those without such disease and lower 
mortality among those with severe chronic re-
spiratory disease (370 of 3720 patients [9.9%]) 
than among those without such disease.
Among the six a priori care-delivery charac-
teristics evaluated, we found no treatment-by-
subgroup interactions (Fig. 3). In particular, 
analyses of treatment effects according to differ-
ences in usual care showed no interaction and 
no evidence of benefit at sites providing less 
aggressive resuscitation, despite considerable vari-
ation among sites in the propensity to adminis-
Figure 1. Patient Survival over a Period of 1 Year.
There was no significant difference in the duration of survival to 1 year be-
tween the group that received early, goal-directed therapy (EGDT) and the 
group that received usual care. Data with respect to survival were censored 
at the actual date that the patient was last known to be alive or at 365 days.

Figure 2 (facing page). 90-Day Mortality According to 
Patient Subgroup.
For details on data harmonization, see Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. Odds ratios were adjusted 
for age, sex, last systolic blood pressure before random-
ization (<90 or ≥90 mm Hg), Acute Physiology and Chron-
ic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (range, 0 to 71, 
with higher scores indicating greater severity of illness), 
and receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (yes or 
no). The size of the square corresponds to the number 
of patients in each subgroup. Age was estimated for 
seven patients in the Protocolised Management in Sep-
sis (ProMISe) trial. The odds ratios according to trial 
for immunocompromised state versus no immunocom-
promised state were as follows: Protocolized Care for 
Early Septic Shock (ProCESS), 1.26 (95% CI, 0.72 to 
2.20) versus 0.82 (95% CI, 0.58 to 1.17); Australasian 
Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE), 1.23 (95% 
CI, 0.60 to 2.50) versus 0.96 (95% CI, 0.73 to 1.26); 
and ProMISe, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.33 to 1.29) versus 1.08 
(95% CI, 0.83 to 1.40). For site of infection, patients 
with other or unknown site include those with an infec-
tion in the central nervous system and those who were 
determined ultimately to have no infection. Three pa-
tients did not meet the eligibility criteria for refractory 
hypotension or hyperlactatemia. APACHE II Acute Phy-
siology Scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores 
indicating greater severity of illness. Scores on the Se-
quential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) range from 
0 to 24, with higher scores indicating a greater degree 
of organ failure.

third, 23.2%, 44.2%, and 65.3%) or intravenous 
fluids (mean volume according to third, 1.3, 2.0, 
and 3.4 liters) in the usual-care group.
In the total of 22 analyses, there were 2 sig-
nificant interaction tests. This finding is consis-
tent with the 1 or 2 such tests that would be 
expected by chance alone.
Costs and Cost-Effectiveness
In each of the three trials, the average cost up to 
90 days was higher with EGDT than with usual 
care (Table 2, and Fig. S2 and Table S13 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Average quality-of-life 
scores and QALYs were similar in the two groups; 
thus, for each trial, the average incremental net 
monetary benefit for EGDT versus usual care 
was negative, and the probability that EGDT is 
cost-effective was less than 0.25 across all realis-
tic willingness-to-pay thresholds (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The sensitivity analy-
sis showed that these base case results were ro-
bust to alternative assumptions (Fig. S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Although the esti-
mated incremental net benefit of EGDT was 
positive for a few of the prespecified subgroups, 
these results had wide 95% confidence intervals 
that included zero (Table S14 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Discussion
The results of our prospective meta-analysis of 
individual patient data provide a more granular 
Figure 3. 90-Day Mortality According to Care-Delivery Subgroup.
For details on data harmonization, see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. Odds ratio were adjusted for age, sex, last systolic 
blood pressure before randomization (<90 or ≥90 mm Hg), APACHE II score, and receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (yes or no). 
The size of the square corresponds to the number of patients in each subgroup. Data for time from emergency department (ED) presen-
tation to first intravenous (IV) antimicrobial agents are only for patients who received IV antimicrobial agents before randomization in 
the ProCESS and ARISE trials; all patients in the ProMISe trial received antimicrobial agents before randomization (time not recorded). 
Results for intensity of underlying care were reported for 115 (83%) of the 138 participating sites with at least three patients who re-
ceived usual care.

Early, Goal-Directed Therapy for Septic Shock
and robust insight than the results of the indi-
vidual trials and of our trial-level meta-analysis 
into the overall effectiveness of EGDT versus 
usual care in patients presenting to the emer-
gency department with septic shock. We found 
no evidence that EGDT resulted in lower mortal-
ity than usual care, a finding that is consistent 
with the results of our trial-level meta-analysis.6 
We also found that, although the three trials 
occurred in geographically distinct health care 
systems, there was no evidence of any trial-spe-
cific effect.
Concerns exist that the divergent findings 
between the trial by Rivers et al.1 and the three 
large, multicenter, randomized, controlled trials 
are because the patients included in the trial by 
Rivers et al. were sicker.13 We found no evidence 
of treatment benefit with EGDT in patients with 
greater severity of illness, despite using several 
approaches to identify subgroups of very sick 
patients that were considerably larger than the 
entire population in the trial by Rivers et al. For 
example, the cohort in the upper third of pre-
dicted risk of death, which was more than four 
times as large as the entire population in the 
trial by Rivers et al., had similar mortality in the 
EGDT group and the usual-care group (approxi-
mately 45%); mortality was also similar to that 
in the control group in the trial by Rivers et al. 
We do not believe, therefore, that differences in 
severity explain the differences in findings. There 
were treatment interactions between EGDT and 
the presence of either severe preexisting respira-
tory or liver disease, but these effects were in-
consistent and probably spurious, given the small 
number of patients with these coexisting condi-
tions and the large number of subgroup analyses.
Another important concern raised about the 
recent trials was that usual care may have been 
superior to that reported in positive studies, ex-
plaining the failure to show a benefit with 
EGDT. Our subgroup analyses explored whether 
the effect of EGDT depended on the usual resus-
citation practice in an emergency department; 
despite wide variation in practice, even in those 
emergency departments with the least aggres-
sive practice, there was no evidence of benefit. 
As noted previously, all three trials are more 
recent than the trial by Rivers et al., and early 
recognition of sepsis and prompt delivery of in-
travenous fluids and antimicrobial agents were 
promoted in all treatment groups. It remains 
possible that general advances in the provision 
of care for sepsis and septic shock, to the benefit 
of all patients, explain part or all of the differ-
ence in findings between the trial by Rivers et al. 
and the more recent trials.
Unlike the results of observational studies,14,15 
which were proposed as evidence supporting the 
ongoing use of EGDT,2,13 this prospectively de-
fined analysis of individual patient data relies 
exclusively on random assignment, avoiding 
biases related to confounding by indication, re-
gression to the mean, or secular trends in sepsis-
related mortality.16,17 This collaboration among 
trial groups also shows that key methodologic 
aspects of independently conducted research can 
be harmonized in advance, facilitating the gen-
eration of a richer evidence base to guide clini-
cians dealing with complex conditions such as 
septic shock. The return on investment for the 
patient, investigator, and funding agency is en-
hanced by our model of early collaboration 
among research groups, aligning key measure-
ments and using a prespecified plan to perform 
a prospective meta-analysis of individual patient 
data to answer questions beyond the scope of 
each individual trial.
Nonetheless, there are important limitations 
to this analysis. Although the overall sample size 
is large, some clinically important subgroups are 
small, which limits statistical power. The analy-
sis is also limited by the underlying internal and 
external validity of the three trials. None were 
blinded, which may introduce bias. Patients were 
enrolled in both academic and nonacademic 
metropolitan and rural hospitals across several 
regions of the world. However, the control 
groups may not be representative of usual care 
in all settings, especially those in low-income 
and middle-income countries.
Although our analysis confirms that EGDT as 
a packaged protocol of care is not superior to 
usual care, there are still unresolved questions 
regarding the most effective fluid and vasopres-
sor regimens, the role of hemodynamic monitor-
ing, and appropriate targets in the resuscitation 
of patients with sepsis and septic shock. Even 
though a policy that mandates routine measure-
ment of central venous pressure and central ve-
nous oxygen saturation in all patients with sep-
sis did not improve outcomes, clinical judgment 
should always be applied because, in specific 
circumstances, there may be a role for these
