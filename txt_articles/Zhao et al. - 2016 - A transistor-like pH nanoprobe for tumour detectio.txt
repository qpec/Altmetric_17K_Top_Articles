Abstract
Because of profound genetic and histological differences in cancerous tissue, it is challenging to 
detect a broad range of malignant tumours at high resolution. Here, we report the design and 
performance of a fluorescent nanoprobe with transistor-like responses (transition pH = 6.9) for the 
detection of the deregulated pH that drives many of the invasive properties of cancer. The 
nanoprobe amplifies fluorescence signal in the tumour over that in the surrounding normal tissues, 
resulting in a discretized, binary output signal with spatial resolution smaller than 1 mm. The

 nanoprobe allowed us to image a broad range of tumours in mouse models using a variety of 
clinical cameras, and to perform real-time tumour-acidosis-guided detection and surgery of occult 
nodules (< 1 mm3) in mice bearing head-and-neck or breast tumours, significantly lengthening 
mice survivability. We also show that the pH nanoprobe can be used as a reporter in a fast, 
quantitative assay to screen for tumour-acidosis inhibitors. The binary delineation of pH achieved 
by the nanoprobe promises to improve the accuracy of cancer detection, surveillance and therapy.
Cancer is a heterogeneous disease that displays diverse inter- as well as intra-tumoural 
genetic and phenotypic variations from non-transformed cells.1 Molecular imaging of 
cancer-specific biomarkers offers the exciting opportunity for tumour detection at the 
earliest onset of disease and has rapidly advanced the preclinical and clinical development of 
a variety of imaging probes. Most common strategies have focused on cell-surface receptors 
such as folate receptor-α (FR-α),2 chlorotoxin,3 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),4 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu),5 and tumour associated antigens (e.g. 
prostate-specific membrane antigen, PSMA).6 Although molecular diagnosis of these 
differences is useful to stratify patients towards personalized therapy, their ability to 
diagnose a wide range of cancers is often not possible because of genetic or phenotypic 
heterogeneity (for example, <25% of breast cancer patients have Her2/neu expression).7, 8 In 
contrast to the diverse genotypes/phenotypes, deregulated energetics is a hallmark of cancer 
and represents a common pathway that is found in many types of cancer.9 The best 
characterized alteration of energy metabolism in cancer cells is aerobic glycolysis (aka the 
Warburg effect), where cancer cells preferentially take up glucose and convert it into lactic 
acid.10 The clinical significance of the Warburg effect has been shown by the wide use of 2-
deoxy-2-[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in positron emission tomography (PET, >1.5 
million annual procedures in the United States alone), which leverages the high glucose 
uptake of cancer cells.11
Dysregulated pH is emerging as another ubiquitous characteristics of cancer as a result of 
deregulated tumour metabolism.12 Cancer cells display a reversed pH gradient with a 
constitutively increased cytosolic pH and decreased extracellular pH (pHe) compared to 
normal tissues regardless of their tissue origin and genetic background. The decreased 
pHe,13, 14 or tumour acidosis in the microenvironment, promotes extracellular matrix 
remodeling and stimulates acid-activated proteases for increased cancer local invasion and 
metastasis. Previously, we have reported the development of a cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-
Lys) (cRGDfK)-encoded, Cy5.5-conjugated pH-activatable nanoprobe to image solid 
tumours.15 In this study, we simplified the previous nanoprobe design by removing the 
cRGDfK ligand and replacing the Cy5.5 dye with indocyanine green (ICG), a fluorophore 
approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. 
The resulting pH-activatable indocyanine green-encoded nanosensor (PINS) improved the 
sharpness of pH response (e.g., ΔpH10–90% decreased from 0.26 to 0.15) while allowing 
deeper fluorescence penetration in tissues due to the longer wavelength of the ICG. PINS 
serves as a self-contained polymeric nanoprobe that acts as a “chemical transistor” with 
sharp on and off response that is analogous to the gating of electronic transistors (Fig. 1a). 
PINS was able to detect a variety of tumours using existing clinical cameras. Real-time, 
image-guided resection of established tumours as well as occult nodules (<1 mm3) in mouse

 models resulted in significantly improved long-term survival after cancer surgery. The ability 
of pH transistor nanoprobes to transform pH from an analog biologic signal to discrete 
exponentially amplified output radically alters the current imaging paradigm for cancer 
diagnosis, surveillance and therapy.
Design and synthesis of PINS
We synthesized the PINS nanoprobe consisting of poly(ethylene glycol)-b-
poly(ethylpropylaminoethyl methacrylate) copolymers (PEG-b-(PEPAx-r-ICGy), x and y 
indicate the number of repeating units of EPA monomer and ICG dye, respectively; 
Supplementary Fig. 1). We systematically investigated the effect of polymer chain length 
and ICG density on the transition pH, sharpness of response, fluorescence activation ratio 
and diameter of the nanoprobes (Supplementary Tables 1–2). Increasing the repeating units 
of PEPA from 40 to 120 resulted in sharper pH transitions (e.g., ΔpHON/OFF decreased from 
0.30 to 0.13, respectively) and slightly lower pH transitions (from 6.96 to 6.91, respectively). 
The particle diameter increased (20 to 30 nm) with the increase of PEPA length. ICG dye 
(λex/λem=780/820 nm) was conjugated to the PEPA segment at different densities (0.5, 1 
and 2 average ICGs per polymer chain). Higher ICG conjugation number resulted in sharper 
pH transitions and higher fluorescence activation ratios. Meanwhile, 2 ICGs per polymer 
chain also reduced the fluorescence intensity at pH 6.5 (on state) due to the increased 
formation of H-dimers as indicated by larger shoulder peak at 750 nm (Supplementary 
Figure 1i). Based on these results, we chose PEG-b-P(EPA100-r-ICG1) as the optimal PINS 
composition (hydrodynamic diameter 26.0±1.1 nm) for subsequent animal studies. A 3D 
plot of fluorescence intensity as a function of pH and nanoprobe concentration illustrates the 
orthogonal pH-modulated fluorescence activation where ICG signal is abolished at blood pH 
(7.4) but dramatically activated at lower pH (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Above pH 6.9, 
hydrophobic micellization and homo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (homoFRET)-
induced quenching16 result in annihilation of fluorescence. Below pH 6.9, PINS is 
dramatically activated due to micelle dissociation into individual unimers as supported by 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The divergent 
protonated unimer and neutral micelle states17 resemble the phase separation behaviors as in 
the P- and N-type semiconductors in the electronic transistors (Supplementary Fig. 3).18 
This binary (off/on) pH threshold sensor design is crucial to amplify the persistent but 
variable acidic tumour pHe (6.5–6.9, avg. 6.84)14 with signal suppression in blood (pH 7.4).
PINS achieves broad tumour detection accuracy
Initial dose-response study using a clinical SPY Elite® camera established 2.5 mg/kg as the 
optimal dose of PINS with large tumour/muscle contrast (CNR=27) and a persistent time 
window (12–24 h) for detection in mice bearing human head/neck HN5 orthotopic tumours 
(Supplementary Fig. 4, Table 3). Besides HN5 tumours, we imaged additional orthotopic 
head/neck tumours (FaDu and HCC4034, the latter from a patient of B.D.S), a subcutaneous 
breast tumour (MDA-MB-231), an intramammary orthotopic breast tumour (triple negative 
4T1), a peritoneal metastasis model from HCT116 colorectal cancer, a patient derived 
xenograft (PDX) of kidney cancer, an orthotopic brain tumour from U87 glioma and two 
transgenic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models (KIC and KPC). All non-transgenic

 tumours were established in non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-
SCID) mice except 4T1 tumours in BalB/C mice. We observed bright tumour illumination 
across all the tumour types (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 5). Ex vivo imaging revealed 
high contrast ratios of tumour over muscle (20–50 fold, Supplementary Fig. 6). Using HN5 
tumour model, we also demonstrated the compatibility of PINS with multiple clinical 
cameras (Supplementary Fig. 7). Comparison of PINS with other commercially available 
near infrared (NIR) probes (800CW-conjugated 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), cRGD, EGF) at 
equivalent dye dose showed superior imaging efficacy with PINS (Fig. 2). ICG-loaded PEG-
b-poly(lactic acid) (PEG-PLA) micelles and free ICG didn’t show observable tumour 
contrast.
To investigate whether PINS can enhance the outcome of FDG-PET, we performed FDG-
PET imaging in head and neck tumour bearing mice followed by PINS imaging. In FDG-
PET, brain, brown adipose tissues and other hypermetabolic tissues are known to avidly take 
up glucose resulting in false positives, a common problem with clinical PET (Supplementary 
Fig. 8).19, 20 For tumour detection, although FDG-PET detected large HN5 tumours (~200 
mm3), it was not successful at detecting small tumour nodules (~10 mm3, Supplementary 
Fig. 8b and Supplementary Tables 4). In contrast, all tumour sizes were clearly visible by 
PINS with high tumour to muscle contrast (CNR>20). Ex vivo signals for brain, brown 
adipose tissues, kidney or other FDG-PET-positive tissues were low (Supplementary Fig. 6). 
Furthermore, PINS was able to delineate tumour margins at submillimeter spatial resolutions 
(Fig. 3). These data suggest that PINS can be used as an adjuvant tool to improve the 
accuracy of tumour staging following FDG-PET. Due to the limitation of light penetration in 
tissues, PINS will be particularly useful in the imaging of superficial tumours such as skin 
cancer or peritoneal metastasis (through a laparoscope).
We investigated the colocalization of PINS signals with tumour boundaries at the 
microscopic level (Supplementary Fig. 9a). HN5 tumour with green fluorescent protein 
(GFP)-labelled cancer cells and surrounding muscle tissues were collected for frozen 
sections (8 μm in thickness) 24 h after intravenous PINS injection. ICG fluorescence from 
PINS illustrates excellent overlap with GFP signals from HN5 cancer cells, which was 
further validated by H&E histology. To evaluate the contribution of dose accumulation on 
tumour contrast, we synthesized 3H-labelled PINS through acetylation (-COCT3) of the free 
amino groups in the copolymer.15 At 24 h after 3H-labelled PINS injection, tumour and 
normal muscle tissues were collected. Nanoprobe accumulation in tumour over normal 
tissues was highly variable between animals (2 to 10-fold) as measured by 3H radioactivity. 
In contrast, PINS fluorescence signals were able to discretize tumour vs. normal tissues due 
to signal amplification through pH activation (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Cellular imaging of 
activated PINS in HN5 tumour frozen sections further showed punctate signals inside cancer 
cells (Supplementary Fig. 9c), which indicate nanoprobe internalization inside acidic 
subcellular organelles (e.g., lysosomes) for sustained tumour contrast.
Tumour acidosis guided surgery by PINS improves survival
We performed real-time tumour acidosis guided surgery (TAGS) using the SPY camera in 
mice bearing HN5 head and neck or 4T1 breast cancers (Movies 1–2). PINS (2.5 mg/kg)

 was injected intravenously 12–24 h before surgery. In a representative operation in HN5 
tumour-bearing mice, after resection of the primary tumour, the residual tumour was clearly 
visible by the SPY camera (Movie 1, also middle left panel in Fig. 4a) but not under white 
light (top left panel). To validate the accuracy of margin delineation in a surgical setting, we 
performed non-survival surgery in 9 mice bearing HN5 head and neck tumours using a 
double blind protocol. The surgeon (B.D.S.) resected the tumours under PINS illumination 
and marked the tissue specimen (2–3 mm in size) as either primary tumour (fluorescence 
positive), tumour margin, or tumour-negative muscle tissue (fluorescence negative) in the 
tumour bed. Frozen sections were made from all specimens, followed by hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) staining. Histological evaluation was performed independently by a surgical 
pathologist (J.T.) (Supplementary Fig. 10). PINS assessment accuracy was validated on all 
of the 27 tissue specimens by histologic interpretation. This observed 100% confirmation 
rate (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, Supplementary Table 5) represents a 95% 
confidence with a lower bound of 89.5%. Long-term survival surgery outcomes show 
improved loco-regional control and overall survival with TAGS over white light surgery 
(WLS), debulking surgery and untreated controls (Fig. 4b). Debulking surgery with 
macroscopically positive margins typically provides no survival benefit for head and neck 
cancer and served as a control for the adequacy of WLS. WLS was superior to the debulking 
and untreated controls (P<0.0001), indicating good unbiased technique. TAGS led to the best 
outcome, with 13 out of 18 animals (72%) showing cures 150 days post-operatively 
(P<0.0001 vs. WLS, Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 6).
To mimic clinical scenarios where identifying occult cancerous nodules is critical, we 
established small orthotopic breast tumours in immunocompetent female BalB/C mice. We 
injected 5×104 triple negative 4T1 breast cancer cells in the inguinal mammary pad. With an 
estimated doubling time of 24 h, the nodule size represents <1 million 4T1 cells in the foci 
on day 4. PINS under SPY camera was able to identify the subcutaneous 4T1 foci through 
the skin, which was confirmed by histology (Fig. 5a–c). Tumour could not be detected with 
visual inspection or palpation. For the white light control, we allowed the tumour to grow to 
~25 mm3 to be visible, and carefully resected the primary tumour and surrounding margin. 
TAGS (Movie 3) resulted in superior visualization, improving survival after resection over 
the untreated control and WLS (P<0.05, Fig. 5d, Supplementary Table 6), demonstrating 
superb imaging sensitivity with PINS.
PINS facilitates screening of acidosis inhibitors
Tumour response to small molecular inhibitors targeting different tumour acidosis pathways 
was evaluated by PINS (Fig. 6). We selected four inhibitors: acetazolamide for carbonic 
anhydrase IX (CAIX),21 α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC) for monocarboxylate 
transporter (MCT),22 cariporide for sodium proton exchanger 1 (NHE1)23 and pantoprazole 
as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)24. PINS was injected intravenously to SCID mice bearing 
HN5, 4T1 or A549 tumours following inhibitor administration. NIR imaging 24 h after 
PINS injection showed greatest inhibition (50–80%) by CAIX inhibitor acetazolamide over 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control in all three models. Other inhibitors showed less 
pronounced and more variable inhibitions in these tumour models. The PINS response is 
consistent with previously reported antitumour efficacy of CAIX inhibitors in tumour

 bearing mice.25, 26 Compared to 1H/31P27 or hyperpolarization 13C magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) methods28, PINS imaging offers a simple and quantitative assay for the rapid 
screening of small molecular drugs targeting tumour acidosis pathways.21, 29
Pharmacokinetic and safety evaluations
To determine the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profiles of PINS, we injected 3H-
labelled PINS at the same dose (2.5 mg/kg) as the imaging dose. The plasma concentration–
time curve showed a two-phase behavior over 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 12a). The α-phase 
half-lives (t1/2,α) was 2.0 ± 1.6 h. The β-phase half-life (t1/2,β) was 8.6 ± 2.7 h (n=4). 
Biodistribution studies show that tumour accumulation was 2.7 ± 1.9 % of injected dose per 
gram (ID/g) of tissue. Liver and spleen were the main organs for PINS uptake.
Safety evaluation of PINS in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice showed temporary body 
weight loss and acute toxicity response at high dose (Supplementary Fig. 13a and 
Supplementary Table 7). The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 250 mg/kg, 
100-fold higher than the optimal imaging dose. Mice were sacrificed on day 1, 7 and 28 at 
200 and 250 mg/kg. Liver and kidney functions were analyzed (Supplementary Fig. 13b–e). 
Liver enzyme levels alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (GOT) 
increased on day 1 after PINS injection and returned to normal after 7 days. Histologic 
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 14) showed microsteatosis in the liver in the 250 mg/kg group 
at day 1 and returned to normal by day 28. Other major organs (e.g., kidney, heart, spleen) 
were normal.
Discussion
Most cancer molecular imaging agents (e.g., mAb-dye conjugates) rely on their bindings to 
intended cancer targets to increase dose accumulation for observed tumour contrast. Such 
strategies translate the target concentration into a linearly proportional imaging signal. This 
analog signal is subject to signal degradation and decreased signal to noise ratio (SNR) 
when amplified by increasing the dose or detector sensitivity, and can show great inter-test 
variability because cancer target expressions are highly variable (e.g., EGFR varies widely in 
head and neck tumours from 0.3 to 97-fold30) with spatial and temporal fluctuations. To 
overcome these limitations, we have previously reported a signal amplification strategy that 
is orthogonal to dose accumulation through pH activation in response to angiogenic tumour 
vasculature and acidic extracellular pH.15 In this study, we further clarified a pH transistor 
concept with binary off/on response at a threshold pH (i.e., 6.9) analogous to the electronic 
transistors with a threshold voltage gating (Supplementary Fig. 3). This transistor concept 
simplified the understanding of PINS function to switch and amplify variable biological 
signals into discretized, binary output (Supplementary Fig. 9a). The significance of this 
conceptual realization became apparent when we performed numerous animal surgeries and 
were able to appreciate the consistency and robustness of the tumour signal. This level of 
consistency is rare in biology and was further confirmed when the current PINS had a 
simplified design without the need to introduce any targeting ligands (e.g., cRGD as in the 
previous study) to achieve broad tumour imaging efficacy.

 Our initial design of PINS with a threshold pH transition at 6.9 was to maximally discretize 
the analog acidic extracellular pHe in tumours (6.5–6.9, avg. 6.84)14 and normal tissue pH 
(7.4). Studies by 3H-labelled PINS and fluorescence microscopy suggest additional factors 
also contribute to the tumour contrast. For example, increased dose accumulation of PINS in 
HN5 tumours was found over muscle tissues (Supplementary Fig. 9b), which may be due to 
the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumours.31 It is worth noting 
pH activation was able to further amplify the variable dose accumulation signal into discrete 
fluorescence signal between tumour and muscle tissues. In addition, fluorescence 
microscopy of tumour sections showed activated PINS in subcellular organelles, which may 
result from increased rates of macropinocytosis of cancer cells as a strategy to catabolize 
proteins for tumour growth and survival.32 Internalization of PINS (either activated or intact) 
in acidic organelles such as lysosomes would keep the signal in the on state and also within 
the tumour cells rather than blurring the surrounding tissue through diffusion. This may 
explain the sustained imaging contrast over 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 4) as well as the sharp 
delineation of tumour boundary over the surrounding muscle tissue (Supplementary Fig. 9a). 
While specific contribution from each input is unclear and may depend on oncogenotypes of 
tumours, the transistor-like behavior of PINS is able to combine the above contributions into 
an emergent and persistent tumour vs. normal tissue signal. This ability of PINS to use pH 
as a trigger to switch and amply tumour signals is unique from conventional pH sensors 
(e.g., cell-impermeable 2-imidazole-1-yl-3-ethoxycarbonyl propanic acid (IEPA) and 3-
aminopropylphosphonate (3-APP))27 designed to measure extracellular pH of solid tumours. 
Compared to these small molecular pH tracers, although PINS loses fine gradations of 
information (e.g., ability to differentiate 6.5 vs. 6.8), its tradeoff is in the maximization of 
detection sensitivity by turning on and integrating all the pH signals below 6.9. This signal 
dichotomization strategy proves essential in achieving real-time image-guided surgery of 
solid tumours (Movies 1–3) as well as detection of small occult diseases (Fig. 5).
Surgical resection is a cornerstone of therapy for patients with solid cancers. For head and 
neck cancer, the complex mechanisms involved with speech and swallowing, the prevention 
of aspiration, and maintenance of the airway place a premium on surgical margins.33 Breast 
conserving lumpectomies are increasingly performed in 60–70% of patients. Repeat surgery 
rates due to inadequate tumour removal though are quite high (20–25%) especially in 
patients with larger tumours, positive axillary nodes, tumours with a lobular histology or 
with an extensive intraductal component.34–37 A variety of exogenous fluorophores have 
been developed for intra-operative margin assessment. Many of these agents are restricted to 
specific receptor expression profiles thereby lack broad detection capability. Receptor-
targeted imaging strategies are effective at stratifying patients toward therapy, but do not 
allow for broad detection of tumours due to the large inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity 
of solid tumours. By targeting a ubiquitous signal cancer hallmark in dysregulated pH, PINS 
has shown broad tumour specificity in a variety of cancer types (head/neck, breast, kidney, 
pancreatic, brain, peritoneal metastasis) and various mouse tumour models (transgenic, 
patient derived xenograft, and orthotopic xenograft). The high spatio-temporal sensitivity 
allowed real-time, image-guided surgery of head/neck and breast cancers (Movies 1–3), 
which significantly improved accuracy in pathological validation of tumour margins (Fig. 
4a). Achieving a tumour-free surgical margin with functional preservation of normal tissues

 is becoming an important objective during surgery. Based on the high resolution capability 
of PINS in delineation of tumour margins, we performed TAGS resection with >70% cures 
in a head and neck tumour models and demonstrated the ability to remove small occult 
nodules in a triple negative breast cancer model. Accurate tumour margin delineation is a 
prerequisite for precise image-guided resection of tumour. Although most cancer surgeries 
do not require submillimeter resolution, real-time, high resolution visualization of tumours 
can still help decision making in the operating room. This is particularly useful in the 
visualization of infiltrating lesions that were indeed detected in our experiments (Movie 1), 
where this additional detection was responsible for at least part of the observed survival 
differences of TAGS over white light surgery (Fig. 4b).
In summary, results from this study establish pH transistor nanoprobes as a broadly 
applicable strategy to allow highly sensitive, cancer-specific detection of malignant tumours. 
The ability of PINS to detect a range of tumours offers a broad image-guided strategy to 
improve tumour surgery. High resolution, real-time delineation of tumours using clinical 
cameras have led to improved cancer detection and eradication in selected head/neck and 
breast cancers. Key to this robust detection is the dichotomization of the output signal in 
response to a predetermined threshold in the input variable. This chemical digitization 
process removes ambiguity related to fluctuations or variability in the input biologic signal 
because of gating, which in turn minimizes noise. Potential challenges that may limit 
universal applicability of the nanoprobes in the clinics include lack of fluorescence in 
benign, slow growing, or necrotic tumours and physical limitation of light penetration in 
biological tissues. Nevertheless, we anticipate this imaging paradigm will deliver broad 
impact in cancer staging, image-guided biopsy or surgery, and will be used as a reporter 
assay for monitoring response of drugs targeting tumour acidosis.
Methods
Synthesis and characterization of PINS
EPA monomer was synthesized following the reported procedure38: 2-
(ethylpropylamino)ethanol (26.2 g, 0.2 mol) and trimethylamine (27.9 mL, 0.2 mol) were 
dissolved in 200 mL dichloromethane and then methacryloyl chloride (19.4 mL, 0.2 mol) 
was added dropwise at 0 °C. The reaction was left overnight at room temperature. The 
solvent was then removed by rotovap and the resulting residue was distilled in vacuo as a 
colorless liquid. PEG-b-(PEPAx-r-ICGy) copolymer was synthesized using the atom transfer 
radical polymerization method.39 In a typical procedure, EPA monomer (797.2 mg, 4 
mmol), 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (50.0 mg, 0.3 mmol), N,N,N′,N″,N″-
pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) (8.4 μL, 0.04 mmol), and MeO-PEG114-Br 
(200.0 mg, 0.04 mmol) were charged into a polymerization tube. Then a mixture of 2-
propanol (1 mL) and DMF (1 mL) was added to dissolve the monomer and initiator. After 
three cycles of freeze-pump-thaw to remove oxygen, CuBr (5.8 mg, 0.04 mmol) was added 
into the reaction tube under nitrogen atmosphere, and the tube was sealed in vacuo. The 
polymerization was carried out at 40 °C for 12 h. After polymerization, the reaction mixture 
was diluted with 10 mL tetrahydrofuran (THF), and passed through an Al2O3 column to 
remove the catalyst. The THF solvent was removed by rotovap. The residue was dialyzed in

 distilled water and lyophilized to obtain a white powder. ICG was conjugated to the primary 
amino groups on the polymer via N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-ester chemistry.40 The 
PINS nanoprobes were produced by a solvent evaporation method.15 The final product was 
either concentrated to a 2.5 mg/mL aqueous stock solution for further usage or lyophilized 
for storage. Transmission electron microscopy analysis was carried out on a JEOL 1200EX 
electron microscope. A Shimadzu UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-1800 model) was used to 
determine the dye content in ICG-conjugated polymer.
FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging
Animal protocol related to this study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee and Radiation Safety Committee. Mouse FDG-PET/CT imaging 
was performed using a Siemens Inveon PET/CT Multi-Modality System (Siemens Medical 
Solutions, Knoxville, TN). All animals were fasted for 12 h prior to FDG-PET imaging. 
Each mouse received 5.55MBq of FDG in 150 μL saline intravenously via tail vein injection. 
The mice were placed on a heat pad before and during image acquisition. PET images were 
acquired 1 h post-injection, for 15 mins, with animals under 2.5% isoflurane. PET images 
were reconstructed into a single frame using the 3D Ordered Subsets Expectation 
Maximization (OSEM3D/MAP) algorithm. CT images were acquired immediately after 
PET. CT projections (360 steps/rotation) were acquired with a power of 80 kVp, current of 
500 μA, exposure time of 145 ms, binning of 4, and effective pixel size of 102 μm. PET and 
CT images were co-registered by the manufacturer’s software. Regions of interest (ROI) 
were drawn manually over the tumour guided by the corresponding CT images. The target 
activity was calculated as %ID/g and standardized uptake value (SUV) (Supplementary 
Table 1).
Fluorescence and tumour margin evaluation
Tumour as well as surrounding tissues was collected 24 h after probe injection. The 
collected samples were frozen in optimum cutting temperature (O.C.T.) medium and 8 μm 
frozen section slides were prepared. The PINS fluorescence was imaged using a 
fluorescence flatbed scanner for 800 nm excitation (Odyssey, LI-COR Biosciences). GFP in 
the cancer cells were imaged with a Deltavision Deconvolution Microscope and images were 
stitched afterwards. H&E staining were performed after all fluorescent images were 
collected. The margins of the tumours were determined by a clinical pathologist (J.T.) from 
H&E staining. PINS fluorescent intensity and surrounding normal tissue fluorescence 
intensity were measured based on five areas of interest (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm) for each sample.
Margin validation
Tissue specimens for margin validation were collected using a double blind protocol. Non-
survival surgeries were performed with fluorescence guidance under a SPY Elite® camera 
on nine head and neck tumour-bearing mice following a similar procedure for survival 
surgery except the mice were sacrificed after the surgery. The surgeon resected the tumours 
under PINS illumination and marked the tissue specimen (2–3 mm in size) as either primary 
tumour, tumour margin or negative muscle tissue based on fluorescence readings. For each 
tumour bearing mouse, one tumour specimen, one tumour margin specimen and one 
negative tumour bed specimen were collected. Frozen sections were prepared from the

 specimens for H&E staining and histology validation. Histological evaluation was 
performed independently by a surgical pathologist without knowing the fluorescence 
assignment for each sample.
Survival surgery
Survival surgeries were performed in orthotopic HN5 head and neck cancer or 4T1 breast 
cancer models. All mice were injected with 2.0 mg/kg PINS 12–24 h prior to the surgery. 
For head and neck cancer surgery, the tumours were allowed to grow to 50 mm3. Before 
surgery, all mice were randomized by an independent technician: each mouse was randomly 
picked up from the cage and assigned to control, debulking, WLS or TAGS group in 
sequence, and the assignment was repeated until all groups reached the designated number 
of animals. Mice were then anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane. Hairs were removed with 
depilatory cream. Mice were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. For the debulking 
surgery group, the tumours were partially removed. For the WLS group, surgery was 
performed under white light illumination with the entire ascertainable tumour removed 
based on the surgeon’s best judgement. For the TAGS group, the surgery was performed 
with fluorescence guidance via a SPY Elite® camera. White light illumination was left on 
for the TAGS group with no interference with ICG imaging. After surgery all animals 
received analgesic and antibiotics. Body weights were monitored before and after the 
surgery. Animals were examined for tumour recurrence three times a week. The animal was 
considered dead if the weight loss was more than 20% of the original body weight or the 
tumour volume exceeded 1500 mm3. For breast cancer surgery, 5×104 of 4T1 cells were 
injected into either left or right inguinal mammary pad for tumour inoculation. For the 
TAGS group the tumours were allowed to grow for 4 days after cancer cell injection. For the 
WLS the tumours were allowed to grow to a palpable size (25 mm3). All animals were 
sacrificed on day 150 after surgery without obvious signs of tumour recurrence.
Tumour acidosis inhibition study
SCID mice bearing HN5 tumours of similar sizes were used to evaluate tumour responses to 
acidosis inhibitors. The mice were injected intravenously with PBS, acetazolamide (40 mg/
kg), α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (200 mg/kg), cariporide (25 mg/kg) and pantoprazole (50 
mg/kg) 1 h before PINS (2.5 mg/kg) injection. Inhibitors except CHC were administrated 
again 6 h after PINS injection. Mice were imaged with Hamamastu PDE 24h after probe 
injection. Tumour fluorescence intensities were measured by Image J and normalized to PBS 
control.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± s.d. where n ≥ 5 and plotted or tabulated as individual data 
points when n < 5. Sample sizes were chosen to ensure adequate power (>85%, at 
significance of 0.05) to detect predicted effect sizes, which were estimated based on either 
preliminary data or previous experiences with similar experiments. The confidence interval 
of PINS detection accuracy was calculated using the exact method (one-sided). Differences 
between groups were assessed using the unpaired, two-sided Student t-test for the 
calculation of p-values. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival function plot and p-
values comparing different survival groups were based on Logrank test. Due to the very
