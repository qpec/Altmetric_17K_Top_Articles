Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by adult-onset 
 
degeneration of motor neurons. The resulting paresis begins 
focally, spreads contiguously, and causes death from respiratory 
failure when the breathing muscles become involved (1). A major 
known cause of the disease is mutations in the gene encoding 
superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (ref. 2; ref. 3 and http:/
/alsod.iop.
kcl.ac.uk/) that confer a cytotoxic gain of function on the enzyme 
that is still poorly understood. Cytosolic inclusions containing 
aggregated SOD1 are hallmarks of ALS in both patients and Tg 
animal models expressing mutant human SOD1 species (hSOD1) 
(4). It is, however, currently unknown whether hSOD1 aggregation 
drives ALS pathogenesis or is a harmless collateral event.
Another unresolved question is the nature of the spreading 
characteristic of the disease. Recent studies have shown that 
SOD1 aggregation can spread from cell to cell in culture systems 
(5, 6). Moreover, whole extracts from end-stage hSOD1-Tg mice 
have been found to transmit disease to mice that express a yellow 
fluorescent protein–conjugated (YFP-conjugated) mutant hSOD1 
(7, 8). Taken together, these findings suggest that hSOD1 aggre-
gates may spread disease in a prion-like fashion in the CNS.
Using a binary epitope–mapping method, we have found 
that 2 different strains of hSOD1 aggregates, A and B, can arise 
in mice that express hSOD1 variants (9). They were structurally 
different from hSOD1 aggregates generated under a variety of 
conditions in vitro, suggesting that the CNS shapes the aggrega-
tion process. Here, to test the spreading hypothesis, we inocu-
lated strain A and B hSOD1 aggregates into lumbar spinal cords 
of mice that express a hSOD1 Tg. We found that the aggregates 
initiated a templated, spreading aggregation of hSOD1 and, in 
parallel, fatal motor neuron disease.
Results and Discusson
Preparation and characterization of the hSOD1 aggregate seeds. The strain 
A and B aggregates were prepared from terminally ill mice expressing 
G85R-mutant hSOD1 (hSOD1G85R) and hSOD1D90A, respectively. Spinal 
cords were homogenized in PBS, to which guanidinium chloride and 
a detergent had been added to dislodge components adhering to the 
aggregates and to dissolve membranes. To separate aggregates from 
soluble hSOD1 species, aggregates in the homogenates were centri-
fuged through a density cushion. The washed pellets were suspended 
by sonication in PBS for use as seeds. Similarly extracted spinal cords 
from non-Tg C57BL/6 mice were used as control seeds.
The hSOD1 aggregates in the seeds displayed typical strain A 
and B structures (Figure 1, A and B). Virtually all of the hSOD1 in 
strain A were full-length monomers (Supplemental Figure 1A; sup-
plemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI84360DS1), whereas 11% of the hSOD1 in strain B was trun-
cated and 4% was present in high-molecular-weight complexes 
(Supplemental Figure 1D). Differential centrifugation and size-
exclusion chromatography showed that over 99% and 95%, 
respectively, of hSOD1 in the A and B seeds was present in aggre-
gates and fibrils (Supplemental Figure 1, B, C, E, and F). The rest 
consisted of folded dimers and monomers, and there was no evi-
dence for the presence of any oligomeric species. For additional 
characterization, see Supplemental Figure 2.
Inoculation of hSOD1 aggregates into spinal cord initiates pre-
mature fatal motor neuron disease. Since human and murine 
SOD1 species lack the ability to coaggregate (refs. 9, 10, and 
Supplemental Figure 3), mice expressing hSOD1 were used 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset degeneration of motor neurons that is commonly caused by mutations 
in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Both patients and Tg mice expressing mutant human SOD1 (hSOD1) 
develop aggregates of unknown importance. In Tg mice, 2 different strains of hSOD1 aggregates (denoted A and B) can arise; 
however, the role of these aggregates in disease pathogenesis has not been fully characterized. Here, minute amounts of 
strain A and B hSOD1 aggregate seeds that were prepared by centrifugation through a density cushion were inoculated into 
lumbar spinal cords of 100-day-old mice carrying a human SOD1 Tg. Mice seeded with A or B aggregates developed premature 
signs of ALS and became terminally ill after approximately 100 days, which is 200 days earlier than for mice that had not 
been inoculated or were given a control preparation. Concomitantly, exponentially growing strain A and B hSOD1 aggregations 
propagated rostrally throughout the spinal cord and brainstem. The phenotypes provoked by the A and B strains differed 
regarding progression rates, distribution, end-stage aggregate levels, and histopathology. Together, our data indicate that the 
aggregate strains are prions that transmit a templated, spreading aggregation of hSOD1, resulting in a fatal ALS-like disease.

We started with the strain A seed. Guided stereotactically, 1 
μl seed suspension was inoculated into the lumbar ventral horn 
on the left side at the L2–L3 levels in mice that were approxi-
mately 100 days old (Figure 1C). The amount of inoculated strain 
A aggregates, 5 ng, was minute, which is 15-fold less than the 
amount of hSOD1G85R present in 1 μl (mg) spinal cord (12). After 
69 days, the mice showed the first signs of disease, with paresis 
in the left hind leg, and after 99 days, they reached the end stage 
as recipients. The hSOD1G85R-Tg model was chosen, as it offers 
several advantages. The level of mutant hSOD1 is as low as the 
background level of murine SOD1 (11, 12). These mice have a 
long symptom-free period, followed by a late middle-age onset 
of paresis and then a rapid disease course (Figure 2A). Most 
important, this is paralleled by a long period during which no 
hSOD1 aggregates can be detected (Figure 2B). Seeding effects 
are therefore easy to discern.

siderable amounts of aggregates were found. At the end stage, 
the levels were roughly 3-fold higher than those detected at 
disease onset (Figure 2, B and C). The growth of aggregation 
was broadly exponential, with doubling times of 10 and 15 days, 
respectively, in the strain A– and strain B–inoculated mice (Sup-
plemental Figure 7).
The spinal cords of strain A–inoculated mice with end-stage 
disease contained half as much detergent-resistant hSOD1 aggre-
gates as did those inoculated with strain B, which in turn were 
comparable to the amounts detected in control-inoculated mice 
(Table 1). The final amounts of A and B aggregates were approx-
imately 300-fold larger than the amounts that were inoculated.
In the presymptomatic mice, the highest levels of aggre-
gates were seen in lumbar spinal cord, and there was signifi-
cantly more on the inoculated left side (Figure 3, A and D). No 
distinct left-right differences appeared in the rostral segments, 
nor in any segment at the later disease stages (Wilcoxon signed-
rank test). Thus, the largely extracellular deposition of the seeds 
in the left side resulted in the aggregation spreading along the 
neuraxis, with essentially even left-right distributions. At the 
end stage, the aggregate distribution along the spinal cord 
had become comparatively even in strain A–inoculated mice, 
whereas the lumbar predominance remained in the strain B–
inoculated group (Figure 3, B, and F). This difference was highly 
significant (Supplemental Figure 8 and Supplemental Table 1). 
The distribution patterns in the control-inoculated and nonin-
oculated groups varied considerably among individual mice, but 
there were overall no significant differences when compared 
with the strain A–inoculated mice. Distinct cervical preponder-
ances, however, only appeared in the former groups. In accord 
with the aggregate distributions, all strain A– and B–inoculated 
mice showed hind leg onsets, mostly on the left side. In contrast, 
7 of the control-inoculated mice showed hind leg onsets and 3 
showed foreleg onsets. All 3 of the latter displayed cervical pre-
ponderances at the end stage of disease (Supplemental Figure 
8). Approximately 40% of the noninoculated mice showed fore-
leg onsets. The distribution patterns and onset sites in the latter 
of disease (Table 1). Human noninoculated hSOD1G85R-Tg mice 
reached the terminal stage approximately 200 days later, as did 
mice inoculated with the control seed (Figure 2A and Table 1).
As further controls, 6 non-Tg C57BL/6 mice were inoculated 
with the strain A seed. Two mice had to be sacrificed after 31 and 
176 days for reasons unrelated to SOD1 aggregation and ALS (Sup-
plemental Figure 5). The remaining mice are currently 546, 546, 
599, and 772 days old and healthy.
We next inoculated the strain B seed. The 1-μl inoculate con-
tained 10 ng strain B hSOD1 aggregates. Unlike strain A, strain B 
aggregates never arise spontaneously in hSOD1G85R-Tg mice (9). 
The first symptoms appeared after 75 days, but the progression 
was slower than in strain A–inoculated mice, and end-stage dis-
ease was reached after 124 days (Figure 2A and Table 1).
There were major losses of motor neurons in the spinal cords 
of end-stage strain A– and strain B–inoculated mice (Table 1). 
Around the time of symptom onset, the mice started losing body 
weight, and at the end stage, fiber-type grouping was seen in skel-
etal muscle, both signs indicating denervation-induced muscle 
atrophy (Supplemental Figure 6). The time from peak weights to 
the end stage was significantly longer in the strain B–inoculated 
mice than in the strain A–inoculated mice.
Spread of templated aggregation along the neuraxis. Spinal cords 
from strain A–inoculated hSOD1G85R-Tg mice with end-stage dis-
ease contained large amounts of aggregates with typical strain A 
patterns that were similar to those that arose in the noninoculated 
mice and that corresponded to the seed used (Figure 1A). The 
strain B–inoculated mice contained similarly large amounts of 
aggregates, but fulfilled the criteria for the B strain: the N-termi-
nal one-third of the sequence recruited to the fibril core, with the 
rest apparently looping in a disordered manner into the solvent 
(Figure 1B and ref. 9).
The 57–72 and 111–127 Abs were used to analyze time courses 
of the strain A and strain B aggregations, respectively (Figure 1, 
A and B). Following the inoculations (Figure 2, B and C), aggre-
gate levels were close to the detection limits. In early symptom-
atic mice, approximately 10 weeks after the inoculations, con-

Data represent the mean ± SD. Symbols denote significant differences between inoculated mouse groups: Astrain A and strain B; Bcontrol and both strain 
A and strain B; Ccontrol and strain A (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, with a Bonferroni-corrected 2-sided Mann-Whitney U test for post-hoc testing); Dremaining 
motor neurons in the spinal cords of end-stage strain A– and strain B–inoculated mice presented as percentages of the number in 200-day-old control-
inoculated mice. Remaining motor neurons did not differ significantly between strain A– and strain B–inoculated mice (P = 0.195). Thirty-two hSOD1G85R-Tg 
mice inoculated with the strain A hSOD1 seed were followed until terminal disease. Four of these appeared to be outliers, i.e., lived longer than 300 days 
(see Figure 2A) and were omitted from the calculations in the Table. Their long survivals may have resulted from technical issues in the complex inoculation 
protocol. The strain B inoculations were carried out after the strain A inoculations, and all 16 mice reached the end stage within a short time interval.

cantly more abundant in the strain B–inoculated mice than in 
the strain A–inoculated and noninoculated mice (Supplemental 
Figure 9, M, N, P, Q, S, T, V, and X, and Supplemental Table 2). 
There were also increased numbers of cells with cytoplasmic 
granular aggregates at the spinal level, although these numbers 
did not differ significantly between the A and B groups. The 
histopathological findings in the brain stem in the end stage 
of disease were more similar to those at the spinal level than 
to the findings at symptom onset in the mice. Histopathology, 
although a poor technique for quantifying aggregate amounts, 
thus suggests differences in tissue distribution between strain A 
and B aggregates.
Conclusions. The results suggest that the 2 hSOD1 aggregate 
strains that arise in the CNS are ALS-inducing prions (15). Their 
structures are widely different, and they are found to provoke phe-
notypes that differ in terms of aggregation and disease progres-
sion rates, neuraxis distributions, terminal levels of aggregates, 
and histopathological findings. However, both cause fatal neu-
rodegenerative conditions bearing the hallmarks of human ALS. 
We believe that these insights are important for the development 
of rational interventions against the relentlessly progressive ALS 
(1) for which no effective treatment exists.
groups suggest that the hSOD1 aggregations initiated at random 
positions along the neuraxis.
Brain showed 10-fold lower levels of aggregates than did spi-
nal cord in strain A–inoculated mice, and the difference was even 
larger in strain B–inoculated mice (Figure 3, B and F, and Sup-
plemental Figure 8, A and B). The hSOD1 aggregates were still 
sparser in cerebellum. These markedly lower levels are hardly 
explained only by the distance from the inoculation sites and sug-
gest that brain and cerebellum, overall, have lower susceptibilities 
to hSOD1 aggregation. Factors contributing to the differences 
could be an enrichment of misfolded hSOD1 monomers in spinal 
cord (13) and the low inherent autophagic capacity of the spinal 
motor system (14).
Histopathology. At symptom onset, the strain A– and B–inoc-
ulated mice showed cytoplasmic granular SOD1–immunoreactive 
aggregates in many neurons and glial cells as well as occasional 
SOD1-immunoreactive threads in the neuropil at all levels of the 
spinal cord (Supplemental Figure 9, A, B, D, E, G, H, J, and K). The 
changes were less advanced in the brainstem. Time-matched, 
control-inoculated mice showed less of these features.
In the end stage, the most obvious change was a vast 
increase in the numbers of neuropil threads. They were signifi-
