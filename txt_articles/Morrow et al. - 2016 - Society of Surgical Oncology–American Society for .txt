Background
Controversy exists regarding the optimal negative margin width for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
treated with breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation (WBRT).
Methods
A multidisciplinary consensus panel used a meta-analysis of margin width and ipsilateral breast
tumor recurrence (IBTR) from a systematic review of 20 studies including 7883 patients and other
published literature as the evidence base for consensus.
Results
Negative margins halve the risk of IBTR compared with positive margins defined as ink on DCIS.
A 2 mm margin minimizes the risk of IBTR compared with smaller negative margins. More widely
clear margins do not significantly decrease IBTR compared with 2 mm margins. Negative margins
less than 2 mm alone are not an indication for mastectomy, and factors known to impact rates of
IBTR should be considered in determining the need for re-excision.
Conclusion
The use of a 2 mm margin as the standard for an adequate margin in DCIS treated with WBRT is
associated with low rates of IBTR and has the potential to decrease re-excision rates, improve
cosmetic outcome, and decrease health care costs. Clinical judgment should be used in determining
the need for further surgery in patients with negative margins , 2 mm.

INTRODUCTION
Breast-conserving therapy (BCT), defined as sur-
gical excision of the primary tumor with a margin of
surrounding normal tissue followed by whole-breast
radiation therapy (WBRT), results in long-term
cause-specific survival rates of greater than 95%
for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as
demonstrated in both randomized trials1 and ob-
servational studies.2,3 Although the addition of
WBRT to surgical excision does not improve
survival, it substantially reduces rates of ipsi-
lateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), even among
patients with small, non-high–grade DCIS.1,4 In the
four early randomized trials of WBRT for DCIS,
microscopically clear margins defined as no ink on
tumor were required in three studies,5-7 but not in
the fourth.8 These studies provide no information on
whether more widely clear margins than no ink on
tumor reduce rates of IBTR in patients having BCT.
Retrospective single-institution studies have
suggested that a negative margin width of 1 cm or
more may eliminate the reduction in IBTR seen
with WBRT,9 leading some to conclude that larger
margins are also beneficial in patients receiving
WBRT. Despite the widespread use of BCT for DCIS,
there is still no consensus on what constitutes an
optimal negative margin width.10 As a consequence,
approximately one in three women attempting BCT
for DCIS undergo a re-excision.11 Re-excisions have
the potential for added discomfort, surgical com-
plications, compromise in cosmetic outcome, ad-
ditional stress for patients and families, and increased
health care costs, and have been associated with
conversion to bilateral mastectomy.12

 Since BCTwas established, the landscape of DCIS management
has evolved with advances in imaging and pathologic evaluation, and
the availability of adjuvant endocrine therapy, resulting in a decline
in IBTR rates.13 In view of these changes and the lack of consensus
on what represents adequate negative margins in DCIS, the Society
of Surgical Oncology (SSO), American Society for Radiation On-
cology (ASTRO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) convened a multidisciplinary margins panel (MP) to evaluate
IBTR in relation to margin width. The primary question addressed
was “what margin width minimizes the risk of IBTR in patients with
DCIS receiving breast-conserving surgery?” The guideline developed
from this consensus panel is intended to assist treating physicians and
patients in the clinical decision-making process based on the best
available evidence. The key findings of the guideline are summarized
in Table 1.
METHODS
The guideline development process was funded by a Susan G. Komen grant.
Committee members were chosen by their respective organizations based
upon interest and expertise in DCIS management (Table 2). Processes rec-
ommended in the Institute of Medicine report “Clinical Practice Guidelines We
Can Trust”14 which were followed as part of the guideline development process
included: (1) the development of a systematic review/study-level meta-analysis
based on questions to be addressed by the MP to serve as the primary evidence
base, with additional topic-specific literature reviews conducted by participants
for questions not addressed in the meta-analysis; (2) the provision for each
recommendation of a rating of the strength of the evidence and the strength of
the recommendation; (3) the ascertainment of the level of agreement of panel
members with each recommendation by vote, and the revision of recom-
mendations to achieve greater than 90% consensus; and (4) the declaration
by MP candidates of potential conflicts of interest before convening, and the
obtaining of written disclosures at the consensus meeting. (The co-chairs
deemed no MP members had conflicts that could influence the process/
development of specific recommendations.)
The MP convened in November 2015; the resulting manuscript was
approved by all panel members and externally reviewed, and feedback was
incorporated. The final manuscript was approved by the SSO Executive Council,
the ASTRO Board of Directors, and the ASCO Board of Directors, and endorsed
by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Breast Surgeons. Patient-
related materials will be available on the Susan G. Komen website (komen.org).
Meta-Analysis
The methodology for the systematic review/meta-analysis has been pub-
lishedelsewhere.15Briefly,usingPreferredReportingItemsforSystematicReviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Institute of Medicine guidelines, EMBASE,
MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, and evidence-based medicine databases were
searched in October 2014 for eligible studies. A summary providing details of the
methodology and statistical approaches is provided in the Appendix. Analysis was
performed using two different statistical approaches. In the frequentist approach,
multiple margin cut points within studies, if reported, were condensed into
a single cut point, while the Bayesian approach allowed for the use of multiple cut
points.16 All reported odds ratio (ORs) were adjusted for study-specific median
follow up time (to account for the inherent increased risk of IBTR with longer
follow up) and are reported relative to positive (or positive/close) margins, or to
a minimal negative margin (no ink on tumor or margin . 1 mm).15
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Studies that included a minimum of 50 patients with DCIS treated
with local excision and reported IBTR in relation to microscopic margin
widths with a minimum median follow up of 4 years were eligible.15
Study Quality/Literature Limitations
All publications in the meta-analysis (except for two) were retro-
spective and provided observational data at the study level. The charac-
teristics of these studies have been reported elsewhere.15
RESULTS
The meta-analysis included 20 studies, 7883 DCIS patients with
known margin status, and 865 IBTRs.15 The median proportion of
patients receiving WBRT was 100% (interquartile range [IQR]
53.3%-100.0%), and the median proportion receiving endocrine
therapy was 20.8% (IQR 0.0%-31.4%). The median follow up was
78.3 months, and the median incidence of IBTR was 8.3% (IQR
5.0%-11.9%). Due to heterogeneity in classification and reporting of
margins data, both a frequentist analysis and a Bayesian network
meta-analysis were conducted with sensitivity analyses. Character-
istics of patients included in the studies are summarized in Table 3.15
GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS
Positive Margins
A positive margin, defined as ink on DCIS, is associated with
a significant increase in IBTR. This increased risk is not nullified by
the use of WBRT.
There is no debate that a positive margin, defined as the
presence of ink from the specimen surface on ducts containing
DCIS, implies a potentially incomplete resection and is associated
with a higher rate of IBTR. In the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’
Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis of randomized
DCIS trials,1 patients with positive margins had a twofold higher
IBTR risk compared with patients with negative margins despite
receiving WBRT (10-year IBTR rate 24% vs 12%), and approxi-
mately 50% were invasive recurrences. The relationship between
margin status and WBRT was examined in a subset analysis of the
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-17
trial by central pathology review of 573 of 818 participants.17 The
annual hazard rate for IBTR after lumpectomy alone was 8.1% for
those with positive margins compared with 3.3% for patients
with negative margins, reduced by WBRT to 2.7% and 1.2%,
respectively. Positive margins were significantly associated with
IBTR in a multivariate analysis of the long-term results of the
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) 10853 trial.18 In the meta-analysis of Marinovich et al
using the Bayesian analytic approach, similar results were ob-
tained.15 After adjustment for study-level follow up, patients with
negative margins were significantly less likely to experience IBTR
than patients with positive margins (OR 0.45, 95% credible interval
[CrI] 0.30-0.62). Similar findings were observed in the frequentist
analysis which necessitated combining positive and close margins
(OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.45-0.62; P , .001). This result persisted after
study-level adjustment for age, median recruitment year, grade of
DCIS, use of WBRT, and use of endocrine therapy.
Negative Margin Widths
Margins of at least 2 mm are associated with a reduced risk of
IBTR relative to narrower negative margin widths in patients receiving

 WBRT. The routine practice of obtaining negative margin widths wider
than 2 mm is not supported by the evidence.
To address the question of optimal negative margin width, the
MP considered data on the distribution of DCIS in the breast.
Studies of mastectomy specimens using whole organ sectioning
and radiologic-pathologic correlation have demonstrated that
while most cases of DCIS are unicentric, the involvement of the
segment may be multifocal, with “gaps” of uninvolved tissue
between foci of DCIS.19 Given this, a “negative margin” does not
guarantee the absence of residual DCIS in the breast.
There are also technical limitations to margin assessment
which impact the relationship between margin width and IBTR.
For example, margins are artifactually narrower ex-vivo when
specimens become flattened from lack of surrounding supportive
tissue, a phenomenon exaggerated by compression for specimen
radiography. Additionally, surface ink can track into deeper

 portions of the specimen, posing significant challenges in de-
termining true margin location. Finally, tumor-to-ink distance on
any single slide may not be representative of the entire specimen; an
“adequate” margin on one section may become positive if addi-
tional or deeper sections are examined. Two common methods
for margin evaluation include sectioning perpendicular to ink (to
determine tumor-to-ink width) or en-face examination of shaved
margins (where any residual tumor in the shaved specimen is
considered a positive margin). While an advantage of the shaved
method is greater surface-area examination, a known disadvantage is
the higher frequency of margins categorized as positive that are, in
comparison, negative by the perpendicular method, which may in
turn result in unnecessary re-excision or even mastectomy.20 Specimen
sampling is also highly variable, and even total sequential embedding
results in only a small proportion (, 1%) of the specimen margins
being examined.21 Together, these studies highlight the substantial
variability in margin assessment irrespective of the technique used.
Despite variability in margin assessment, great emphasis has
been placed on achieving specific negative margin widths. In the
Marinovich frequentist meta-analysis, comparison of specific margin
width thresholds (2 mm, 3 or 5 mm, and 10 mm) relative to negative
margins defined as . 0 mm or 1 mm included 7883 patients with
a median follow up of 6.5 years. The ORs for 2 mm (0.51 [95% CI
0.31-0.85], P 5 .01), 3 or 5 mm (0.42 [95% CI 0.18-0.97], P 5 .04),
and 10 mm (0.60 [0.33-1.08], P 5.09) showed comparable reductions
in the odds of IBTR compared with . 0 mm or 1 mm, and pairwise
comparisons found no significant differences in the odds of IBTR
between the 2 mm, 3 or 5 mm, and 10 mm margin thresholds (all
P . 0.40). In this model, the predicted 10-year IBTR probability for
2 mm negative margins was 10.1% (95% CI 6.3%-16.0%) compared
with 8.5% for 3 or 5 mm (95% CI 3.6%-18.9%) and 11.7% (95%
CI 6.7%-19.4%) for 10 mm margins. In the Bayesian network meta-
analysis (Table 4),15 the ORs of incrementally wider negative margins
relative to the positive margin category were 0.45 (95% CrI 0.32-0.61)
for . 0 or 1 mm, 0.32 (95% CrI 0.21-0.48) for 2 mm, 0.30 (95% CrI
0.12-0.76) for 3 mm, and 0.32 (95% CrI 0.19-0.49) for 10 mm.
Adjustments for clinically relevant covariates, including sensitivity
analysis limited to studies using radiation therapy (RT), did not alter
these mean OR estimates (Table 4). In this analysis, the relative odds
ratio (ROR) of IBTR between the 10 mm and 2 mm threshold groups
compared with positive margins was 0.99 (95% CrI 0.61-1.64), in-
dicating no statistically meaningful difference.
The choice of the 2 mm threshold rather than . 0 (no ink on
tumor) or 1 mm was based upon evidence of a statistically sig-
nificant decrease in IBTR for 2 mm compared with 0 or 1 mm in
the frequentist analysis (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.85; P 5.01) coupled
with weak evidence in the Bayesian model of a reduction in IBTR with
the 2 mm distance compared with smaller distances (ROR 0.72, 95%
CrI 0.47-1.08). However, while the MP felt that there was evidence
that the 2 mm margin optimized local control, clinical judgment must
be used in determining whether patients with smaller negative margin
widths (. 0 or 1 mm) require re-excision. Factors felt to be important
to consider include assessment of IBTR risk (residual calcifications on
postexcision mammography, extent of DCIS in proximity to margin,
which margin is close [i.e., anterior excised to skin or posterior excised
to pectoral fascia v margins associated with residual breast tissue]),
cosmetic impact of re-excision, and overall life expectancy. The
conclusion that re-excision could be selectively used with margins
smaller than 2 mm was influenced by the high long-term rates of local
control reported in the NSABP DCIS trials which required a margin of

 no ink on tumor7 as well as the study of Van Zee et al which, after
adjusting for multiple covariates, found no difference in risk between
margins of # 2 mm and more widely clear margins in patients re-
ceiving WBRT.22
Treatment With Excision Alone
Treatment with excision alone, regardless of margin width, is
associated with substantially higher rates of IBTR than treatment with
excision and WBRT, even in predefined low-risk patients. The optimal
margin width for treatment with excision alone is unknown, but
should be at least 2 mm. Some evidence suggests lower rates of IBTR
with margin widths wider than 2 mm.
The EBCTCG DCIS meta-analysis showed that the 10-year
IBTR rate for patients treated with excision alone was higher than
with excision and WBRT, both for those with negative margins
(26.0% vs 12.0%, P , .00001) and positive margins (48.3% vs
24.2%; P 5 .00004).1 The same proportional benefit for WBRT
was seen in women treated with local excision and those having
large sector resections. In the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) 9804 trial where patients with small, mammographically
detected low-to-intermediate grade DCIS and margins $ 3 mm
were randomized to excision alone or excision plus WBRT, 7-year
IBTR rates were 6.7% and 0.9% (P 5 .0003), respectively.4 The
prospective, multi-institutional Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) E5194 study of patients with low-risk DCIS treated
with excision alone (negative margin width $ 3 mm) reported
12-year rates of IBTR of 14.4% for nonhigh grade DCIS # 2.5 cm
in size and 24.6% for high-grade DCIS # 1 cm in size. However,
IBTR rates did not differ significantly for margins , 5 mm, 5-9 mm,
or $ 10 mm (P 5.85).23 A prospective single-arm study of patients
with mammographically detected DCIS # 2.5 cm in size reported
a 10-year IBTR rate of 15.6%24 despite requiring margins of $ 1 cm.4
In contrast, Van Zee et al found in 1266 patients treated with exci-
sion alone that 10-year IBTR rates were 16% for margins . 10 mm,
and increased to 23% for margins between 2.1 and 10 mm, 27%
for . 0-2 mm, and 41% for positive margins. After adjustment
for multiple factors, margin width was a more highly significant
predictor of IBTR (P , .0001).22 The MP felt that, overall, the
heterogeneity of the evidence between the above-reported studies
did not allow for a definitive recommendation for margin widths
greater than 2 mm in patients foregoing RT.
Endocrine Therapy
Rates of IBTR are reduced with endocrine therapy, but there is no
evidence of an association between endocrine therapy and negative
margin width.
Tamoxifen reduces the incidence of both IBTR and contra-
lateral breast cancer, but the absolute benefit is relatively small.7,25
In the NSABP B-24 trial, patients treated with lumpectomy and WBRT
were randomized to tamoxifen or placebo; 25% of the population had
positive or unknown margins. The 15-year IBTR rate for the placebo
group was 17.4% in those with positive margins compared with 7.4%
for clear margins. Adjuvant tamoxifen lowered IBTR rates among those
with positive margins to levels similar to those in the negative margin
cohort (17.4% placebo, 11.5% tamoxifen); conversely, there was little
impact of tamoxifen in the negative margin cohort (IBTR 7.4%
placebo, 7.5% tamoxifen).7 Hence, the MP felt that while tamoxifen
decreases IBTR in patients with positive margins, there was no evidence
to suggest an association between negative margin width and the
benefit of endocrine therapy.
Patient and Tumor Features
Multiple factors have been shown to be associated with the risk of
IBTR in patients treated with and without WBRT, but there are no

NOTE. Data from Marinovich et al.15
Abbreviations: CrI, credible interval; DCIS, ductal carcinoma in situ; OR, odds ratio; RT, radiation therapy.
*These studies were ineligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis from Marinovich et al because of lack of summary age data (see eligibility criteria); hence sensitivity
analysis reports estimates if these were included in models.
†Two studies using a 5 mm threshold were included with the 3 mm threshold group.
‡95% CrI for relative odds ratio of 10 mm versus . 0 or 1 mm did not cross 1 (see meta-analysis methods).
§Due to missing covariate information, these analyses were undertaken in a reduced number of studies (19 for endocrine therapy; 16 for high-grade DCIS).

 data addressing whether margin widths should be influenced by these
factors.
Young patient age has consistently been associated with IBTR,
and tumor factors such as histologic pattern, comedo necrosis, and
nuclear grade and size of DCIS also modify the risk of IBTR.17,26,27
More recently, unfavorable gene profile scores have also been asso-
ciated with IBTR.28,29 However, there are no data addressing whether
margin widths should be influenced by these factors, and this rep-
resents an appropriate area for further study.
Radiation Delivery
Choice of WBRT delivery technique, fractionation, and boost
dose should not be dependent upon negative margin width. There is
insufficient evidence to address optimal margin widths for accelerated
partial breast irradiation (APBI).
The vast majority of patients treated in the five prospective
randomized DCIS trials of excision with or without WBRTreceived
conventionally fractionated WBRT without a boost. Only one of
the trials allowed the option of hypofractionated whole-breast RT
(HWBRT) in addition to standard WBRT,4 and # 10% of the
patients in three of the trials received a boost.6-8 None of the
randomized trials varied RT technique according to margin
status, and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) and accelerated
partial breast irradiation (APBI) were not used.
There is no direct evidence from randomized trials to
support the use of a boost to the primary tumor site for patients
with DCIS, although in patients with invasive breast carci-
noma, the long-term value of a boost in reducing IBTR has been
demonstrated.30
Two ASTRO consensus guidelines have addressed technical
issues in the setting of BCT. While largely focusing on invasive breast
carcinoma, the ASTRO statement on HWBRT concluded there was
insufficient evidence to recommend for or against HWBRT in the
setting of DCIS.31 In the ASTRO statement on APBI, DCIS was
placed into the “cautionary” group based on the lack of evidence
from randomized trials, while noting that DCIS patients have been
included in some retrospective cohort studies.32
Therefore, there is no evidence that margin width, in isolation,
should determine radiation delivery technique, fractionation of
WBRT, or use/dose of a boost. The MP considered the evidence
base insufficient to address optimal margin width in APBI.
DCIS in the Presence of Invasive Breast Cancer
DCIS with microinvasion, defined as no invasive focus . 1 mm
in size, should be considered as DCIS when considering the optimal
margin width.
There are two diagnoses for which there is overlap between the
DCIS Margin Guideline and the Invasive Cancer Margin Guide-
line33: DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M) and invasive carci-
noma associated with DCIS (extensive intraductal component
[EIC] or lesser amounts of scattered DCIS). In DCIS-M, defined by
the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) as the extension
of cancer cells beyond the basement membrane with no focus more
than 0.1 cm in greatest dimension,34 small retrospective studies
suggest that rates of IBTR are similar to those seen with pure
DCIS.35,36 In the absence of specific data to address margin width
in DCIS-M, the MP, based on expert opinion, felt that DCIS-M
should be considered as DCIS when considering the optimal
margin width, given that the majority of the lesion is comprised of
DCIS and that systemic therapy utilization for DCIS-M more
closely reflects the treatment pattern for DCIS than for invasive
carcinoma.
In contrast, when considering margin width for an invasive
cancer with a DCIS component, regardless of extent, the MP felt
that the invasive cancer guideline33 was applicable, primarily be-
cause the natural history and treatment of these lesions is more
similar to invasive cancer than DCIS, even when the close margin
contains DCIS. In particular, the vast majorityof patients with invasive
cancer receive systemic therapy, which remains less common for
pure DCIS. The invasive cancer guideline33 did note that an EIC
is a marker for a potential heavy burden of residual DCIS and
that postexcision mammography, the presence of multiple close
margins, and young patient age can be used to select patients
who will benefit from re-excision. These statements echo the
discussion of the MP regarding the use of re-excision in pure
DCIS with margins , 2 mm discussed previously, and thus we
believe that the guidelines are compatible.
DISCUSSION
There are limitations to this guideline. It applies to patients with
DCIS and DCIS-M treated with WBRT. The findings should not be
extrapolated to DCIS patients treated with APBI or those with
invasive carcinoma for whom a separate guideline has been de-
veloped.33 While studies including patients treated with and without
WBRTwere included in the meta-analysis, a meta-analysis of studies of
treatment with excision alone was not conducted. Additionally, all of
the studies included in the meta-analysis were retrospective. However,
in the absence of any planned prospective randomized trials addressing
the question of margin width and local recurrence, these studies
represent the best available evidence for clinical decision making.

 Appendix
Summary of Methodology for the Margins Meta-Analysis
The methods for the meta-analysis are described in full in Marinovich et al,15 and are summarized briefly below.
Study Eligibility Criteria
Eligible studies enrolled $ 50 women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) undergoing breast conserving surgery (BCS); allowed
calculation of the crude local recurrence (LR) rate by microscopic margin status; defined negative margins by a numeric threshold;
reported mean or median age; and presented mean or median follow up of $ 48 months.
Literature Search and Data Extraction
MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, and ALL EBM REVIEWS were searched in October 2014. One investigator screened
citations, with a sample independently screened by a second. Two investigators independently extracted data; disagreements were
arbitrated by a third investigator.
Statistical Analysis
Frequentist models (random effects logistic meta-regression). Margins were dichotomised into positive/close versus negative
margin status using one distance threshold per study (. 0 or 1 mm; 2 mm; 3 or 5 mm; 10 mm). The association between LR and
margin status and distance was modeled using random effects logistic meta-regression. Odds ratios (ORs) are presented for negative
relative to positive/close margins, and threshold distances relative to . 0 or 1 mm.
Bayesian models (network meta-analysis). Network meta-analysis using Mixed Treatment Comparisons used data from single
or multiple thresholds within studies (when presented) to compare directly (within study) and indirectly (between studies) the
probability of LR between margins categories (positive; . 0 or 1 mm; 2 mm; 3 mm; 10 mm). ORs compare negative versus positive
margins, and distance categories relative to positive margins.
Assessment of covariates. All models were adjusted for study-level follow up time. Other covariates were assessed for their effect
on model estimates (age; median year of recruitment; proportion of patients who received endocrine therapy; proportion with
high-grade DCIS; proportion of patients receiving whole breast radiation).
