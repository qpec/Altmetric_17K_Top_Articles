cannabidiol prevents pain and nerve damage in
rat osteoarthritis

Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial joint disease, which includes joint degeneration, intermittent inflammation, and peripheral
neuropathy. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a noneuphoria producing constituent of cannabis that has the potential to relieve pain. The aim of
this study was to determine whether CBD is anti-nociceptive in OA, and whether inhibition of inflammation by CBD could prevent the
development of OA pain and joint neuropathy. Osteoarthritis was induced in male Wistar rats (150-175 g) by intra-articular injection
of sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA; 3 mg). On day 14 (end-stage OA), joint afferent mechanosensitivity was assessed using in vivo
electrophysiology, whereas pain behaviour was measured by von Frey hair algesiometry and dynamic incapacitance. To investigate
acute joint inflammation, blood flow and leukocyte trafficking were measured on day 1 after MIA. Joint nerve myelination was
calculated by G-ratio analysis. The therapeutic and prophylactic effects of peripheral CBD (100-300 mg) were assessed. In
end-stage OA, CBD dose-dependently decreased joint afferent firing rate, and increased withdrawal threshold and weight bearing
(P , 0.0001; n 5 8). Acute, transient joint inflammation was reduced by local CBD treatment (P , 0.0001; n 5 6). Prophylactic
administration of CBD prevented the development of MIA-induced joint pain at later time points (P , 0.0001; n 5 8), and was also
found to be neuroprotective (P , 0.05; n 5 6-8). The data presented here indicate that local administration of CBD blocked OA pain.
Prophylactic CBD treatment prevented the later development of pain and nerve damage in these OA joints. These findings suggest
that CBD may be a safe, useful therapeutic for treating OA joint neuropathic pain.

1. Introduction
The most prominent form of synovial joint disease, osteoarthritis
(OA), is characterised by joint degeneration, pain, and in some
patients, articular neuropathy.21 Chronic pain associated with OA
is a major concern for which there are few viable treatments. The
first-line therapy used to treat OA pain is nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs; however, with long-term use their efficacy
declines and they can lead to major adverse gastrointestinal and
cardiovascular events. Historically, OA has been classified as
noninflammatory arthritis; however, there is now overwhelming
evidence
that
synovitis
can
occur
in
response
to
pro-
inflammatory mediators being released into the joint.10,11,13,29,32
It is believed that this low-level inflammation contributes to
degenerative changes that affect the entire joint leading to the
development
of
peripheral
sensitisation
and
nociceptive
pain.18,22,37 In addition to structural defects, there is growing
evidence to suggest that approximately 30% of patients with OA
have neuropathic pain.1,34 Thus, a therapeutic which can block
inflammation, neuropathy, and pain is sorely needed.
The endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays an important
physiological role in the regulation of tissue inflammation and
pain.23,38 A functional ECS has been demonstrated in the joints of
animals36 and humans,31 which acts tonically to maintain joint
homeostasis. Immunohistological and pharmacological evidence
confirm that cannabinoid 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid 2 (CB2)
receptors are expressed on the neurones and microvasculature
that supply rat knee joints.23,24,36 In addition, CB2 receptors are
colocalized with pronociceptive transient receptor potential
vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels where, through common intra-
cellular pathways, they act together to modulate joint pain.23,24,36
This suggests that drugs which target the ECS have the potential
to regulate painful arthritis and inflammatory joint disease.
Cannabidiol is the main noneuphoria producing component of
the cannabis plant.26 Pharmacologically, CBD has a complex
signalling mechanism whereby it can both activate and silence
classical cannabinoid receptors as well as modulate noncanon-
ical cannabinoid receptor pathways. In in vitro studies, CBD has
been shown to be an inverse agonist at CB2 receptors,40 and a full
antagonist at CB1 receptors40 and G protein-coupled receptor-
55 (GPR55).33 In vitro, CBD was found to be an agonist at TRPV13
and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1),9 which play

 a central role in the development of OA.27 In musculoskeletal
disease models, systemic administration of CBD suppressed the
progression of collagen-induced arthritis by reducing inflamma-
tory cytokine production.20 Although these preliminary findings
indicate a possible role for CBD in relieving joint inflammation, the
local effect of articularly applied CBD on OA and joint pain has not
been investigated.
The initial aim of this study was to assess the effect of locally
administered CBD on joint pain in animals with end-stage OA.
Since acute inflammation can contribute to the long-term de-
velopment of OA joint pain,32 the ability of CBD to reduce acute OA
synovitis and prevent the subsequent progression of persistent OA
pain was also investigated. Finally, the effect of prophylactic CBD
treatment on OA joint neuropathy was assessed.
2. Methods
2.1. Animals
Male Wistar rats (150-175 g; Charles River Laboratories, Senne-
ville, QC, Canada) were housed in ventilated racks at 22˚C 62˚C on
a 12:12 hours light:dark cycle (light-on from 7:00 to 19:00). After
arrival at the animal care facility, all rats were permitted at least 1
week to acclimate to their environment. Animals were housed in
pairs, cages were lined with woodchip bedding, and animals were
provided with environmental enrichment. Standard laboratory
chow and water were provided ad libitum. All experimental
protocols were approved by the Dalhousie University Committee
on the Use of Laboratory Animals, which acts in accordance with
Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) and
the standards put forth by the Canadian Council for Animal Care.
2.2. Sodium monoiodoacetate model of osteoarthritis
Animals were deeply anaesthetised (2%-4% isoflurane; 100%
oxygen at 1 L/min) until cessation of all sensory reflexes. The right
knee joint was shaved, swabbed with 100% ethanol and 50 mL of
sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA) (3 mg in saline) was injected into
the joint space (intra-articular; i.artic.). The knee was then
manually extended and flexed for 30 seconds to disperse the
solution throughout the joint.
2.3. Electrophysiological recording of joint afferents
After OA development (14-19 days after MIA), animals were deeply
anaesthetised using urethane (25% solution; 2 g/kg i.p.). Core
body temperature was measured by a rectally inserted thermom-
eter and maintained at 37˚C 6 1˚C by a thermostatically controlled
heating blanket (CWE Inc, Ardmore, PA). After loss of the pedal
withdrawal reflex, the trachea was cannulated to allow for artificial
ventilation with a Harvard rodent respiratory pump (Harvard
Apparatus, Holliston, MA) with 100% O2 (stroke volume: 2.5 mL;
breath frequency: 52 breaths/min). The left carotid artery was
cannulated to allow for continuous measurement of the mean
arterial blood pressure. The cannula was attached to an in-line
pressure
transducer
(Kent Scientific Corp, Torrington,
CT)
attached to a differentially amplified blood pressure monitor (World
Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The jugular vein was
cannulated for administration of the muscle relaxant gallamine
triethiodide (50 mg/kg), which eliminated neural interference from
hind limb musculature, and the distal saphenous artery was
cannulated for close intra-arterial (i.a.) administration of CBD or
vehicle to the knee joint (100 mL injection volume). A specialised
clamp was fixed to the mid-shaft of the isolated right femur and
attached to a stereotaxic frame to prevent movement of the
proximal aspect of the rat hind limb. The right hind paw was then
placed in a shoe-like holder that was connected to a force
transducer and torque meter (Data Track 244-1-R; Intertechnol-
ogy, ON, Canada) to standardise the amount of rotational force
being applied to the knee joint. A longitudinal skin incision was
made along the medial aspect of the hind limb and the reflected
skin was sutured to a metal “O” ring to create a pool which was
filled withwarm mineral oil to prevent tissue desiccation.The medial
articular branch of the saphenous nerve was isolated and
transected in the inguinal region to prevent spinal reflexes. The
epineurium was removed and the nerve teased to isolate fine
neurofilaments which were then placed on a platinum recording
electrode to measure single-unit activity. To identify a joint afferent
fibre and its receptive field, the knee joint was gently probed with
a blunt glass rod. The mechanical threshold of each recorded joint
afferent was determined by gradually increasing the torque applied
to the joint until the fiber elicited an action potential. The conduction
velocity of the fibres were determined by electrically stimulating the
receptive field with a pair of silver bipolar stimulating electrodes (0.6
Hz, 2 ms pulse width, 1-15 V). The mechanosensitivity of the joint
fibre was assessed by applying noxious outward rotations to the
knee and counting the number of action potentials elicited during
the rotation. Noxious rotation refers to torque occurring outside the
normal range but not severe enough to cause soft tissue injury.
2.3.1. Experimental timeline
On day 14 post-MIA induction, 3 sets of noxious rotations, each
lasting 5 seconds, were applied 5 minutes apart as a baseline
measurement of afferent activity. After close i.a. infusion of CBD
(100, 200, or 300 mg in 100 mL) or vehicle (100 mL), joint
mechanosensitivity was assessed for an additional 15 minutes.
To minimise the use of animals, multiple doses of CBD or vehicle
were assessed in each fibre. A washout period of at least 50
minutes was observed between the administration of varying
doses of CBD or vehicle to allow afferent firing to return to
baseline levels. The percentage change in afferent activity before
and after administration of CBD or vehicle was calculated offline
using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cam-
bridge, United Kingdom). All recorded fibres fired in response to
close i.a. administration of potassium chloride (KCl; 1 mM,
0.1 mL) at the conclusion of the experiment, confirming that
administered drugs had reached the mechanosensory nerve
endings and that the recorded fibre was still viable.
2.4. Behavioural pain measurements
2.4.1. Von Frey hair mechanosensitivity
Von Frey hair mechanosensitivity was used as a measure of
secondary allodynia. Alert, unanaesthetised animals were placed
in a Plexiglas chamber with a metal mesh flooring which allowed
access to the plantar surface of each hind paw. After allowing the
animal to acclimate until exploratory behaviour ceased (approx-
imately 10 minutes), ipsilateral hind paw mechanosensitivity was
assessed using a modification of the Dixon up–down method.5 A
von Frey hair was applied perpendicular to the plantar surface of
the ipsilateral hind paw (avoiding the toe pads) until the hair flexed;
the filament was then held in place for 3 seconds. If there was
a positive response (ie, withdrawal, shaking, or licking of the hind
paw), the next lower strength hair was applied; if there was a lack
of response, the next higher strength hair was applied up to a cut-
off of 15 g bending force. The 50% withdrawal threshold was

 determined using the following formula: 10(Xf 1 kd)/10,000; where
Xf 5 value (in log units) of the final von Frey hair used, k 5 tabular
value for the pattern of the last 6 positive and/or negative
responses, and d 5 mean difference (in log units) between stimuli.
2.4.2. Hind limb incapacitance
To perform dynamic weight bearing (DWB) measurements,
animals were placed in a Perspex chamber (model BIO-DWB-
AUTO-R; Bioseb, Boulogne, France) with a pressure-sensitive
floor and allowed to move freely. Hind limb weight bearing was
tracked and recorded over a 3-minute period. Weight borne on
the ipsilateral hind paw was calculated as a percentage of the
total weight borne on the hind limbs.
2.4.3. Experimental timeline
Animals underwent baseline von Frey hair mechanosensitivity
and DWB testing. Separate cohorts were treated on day 14 post-
MIA with an i.artic. injection of either vehicle (50 mL) or CBD (100-
300 mg/50 mL). In other experimental cohorts, day 14 OA rats
were treated with the highest dose of CBD (300 mg/50 mL) and
either the CB1 receptor antagonist, AM281 (75 mg/50 mL), the
CB2 receptor antagonist, AM630 (75 mg/50 mL), or the TRPV1
receptor antagonist, SB-366791 (30 mg/50 mL) administered
locally (subcutaneously; s.c.) over the joint 10 minutes before
i.artic. CBD administration. Behavioural pain measurements for
these experiments were conducted at 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240
minutes after drug administration. To investigate the prophylactic
effects of CBD on OA pain and peripheral neuropathy, a separate
cohort of rats was treated with CBD (300 mg/50 mL) or vehicle
(50 mL) s.c. over the knee joint 30 minutes before i.artic. injection
of MIA (3 mg/50 mL) and once daily on each of the subsequent 3
days; behavioural pain measurements were conducted on days
0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14.
2.5. Inflammation measures
Animals were deeply anaesthetised by an intraperitoneal injection
of urethane (25% solution; 2g/kg i.p.). A longitudinal incision was
made along the ventral skin of the neck to expose the trachea
which was cannulated with PE-200 tubing to permit unrestricted
breathing. The right carotid artery was also cannulated with
PE-30 tubing filled with heparinised saline (1 U/mL) to allow for
continuous monitoring of the mean arterial pressure (MAP).
2.5.1. Intravital microscopy
Both hind limbs were immobilised and the capsule of the
ipsilateral knee was exposed by surgically removing a small
ellipse of the overlying skin and superficial fascia. Physiological
buffer (37˚C 6 1˚C) was immediately and continuously perfused
over the exposed joint.
Intravital
microscopy
was
used
to
assess
leukocyte-
endothelial interactions within the microcirculation of the knee
joint, as described previously.2 The synovial microcirculation was
visualised under incident fluorescent light using a Leica DM2500
microscope with a HCX APO L 20X objective and an HC Plan 10X
eyepiece giving a final magnification of 3200. In vivo leukocyte
staining was achieved by intravenous administration of 0.05%
rhodamine 6G (in saline). Straight, unbranched postcapillary
venules (15-50 mm in diameter) were chosen for visualisation and
3 fluorescent videos (per time point) were captured for 1 minute
each by a Leica DFC 3000 camera (Leica Microsystems Canada
Inc, Richmond Hill, ON, Canada). Two measures of leukocyte-
endothelial interactions were used to assess articular inflamma-
tion: (1) the number of rolling leukocytes to pass an arbitrary line
perpendicular to the venule in 1 minute were counted and (2) the
number of adherent leukocytes within a 100-mm portion of the
venule. Rolling leukocytes were defined as positively stained
blood cells travelling slower than the surrounding blood flow, and
adherent leukocytes were defined as positively stained cells that
remained stationary for a minimum of 30 seconds.
2.5.2. Laser speckle contrast analysis
In the same animals, knee joint blood flow was measured by laser
speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) using a PeriCam PSI System
(Perimed Inc, Ardmore, PA). At each time point, 1-minute
recordings of the exposed knee joint were taken at a working
distance of 10 cm with a frame capture rate of 25 images per
second. Using dedicated software (PIMSoft, Version 1.5.4.8078),
images were averaged to generate 1 perfusion image per second.
At the end of the experiment, rats were euthanised and a dead
scan of the knee was taken. This “biological zero” value was
subtracted from all measurements to account for any Brownian
motion in the tissue. Images were analysed offline where mean
blood perfusion (perfusion units) in a defined region of interest
approximating the knee joint was calculated.
2.5.3. Experimental timeline
Inflammation measures were conducted on day 1 post-MIA
induction, which corresponds to the peak of inflammation in this
OA model. After baseline intravital microscopy and LASCA
recordings (1 minute) a 50-mL bolus of CBD (300 mg) or vehicle
(separate cohort) was applied topically over the exposed knee joint.
Subsequent recordings were taken at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180
minutes after drug administration. In separate cohorts, day 1 MIA
rats were treated with the highest dose of CBD (300 mg/50 mL) and
either the CB1 receptor antagonist, AM281 (75 mg/50 mL), the CB2
receptor antagonist, AM630 (75 mg/50 mL), or the TRPV1 receptor
antagonist, SB-366791 (30 mg/50 mL) administered topically over
the joint 10 minutes before CBD administration.
2.6. G-ratio analysis of the saphenous nerve
A segment of the saphenous nerve was isolated proximal to the
ipsilateral knee joint and placed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (diluted
with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer), and stored at 4˚C for at least
1 week. The nerve samples were then removed from the fixative
and rinsed 3 times with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. The
samples were fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 hours, rinsed with
distilled water, and then placed in 0.25% uranyl acetate (4˚C)
overnight. The samples were then dehydrated in a graduated
series of acetone (50%, 70%, 95%, and finally 100%). The samples
were then dried in 100% acetone for 10 minutes. Epon–araldite
resin was used to mount the samples. The samples were placed in
a 3:1 ratio of dried 100% acetone to resin for 3 hours, followed by
a 1:3 ratio of dried 100% acetone to resin overnight. Next the
samples were placed in 100% Epon–araldite resin for 3 hours and
cured in an oven at 60˚C for 48 hours. Finally, using an LKB Huxley
ultramicrotome with a diamond knife, the samples were sectioned
into 100 nm thick slices. Cross-sectional slices of nerves were
placed onto a copper wire grid consisting of 300 individual squares
per inch (each square measuring 83 3 58 mm) and then stained
with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 10 minutes and finally lead
citrate for 4 minutes.

 The copper wire grids containing the saphenous nerve sections
were inserted into a JEOL JEM 1230 transmission electron
microscope (JEOL Corp Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The microscope
was set at a voltage of 80.0 kV, and images were captured at
32500 using a Hamamatsu ORCA-HR digital camera (Hamamatsu
Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). One nerve cross-section
image was visually partitioned into 9 quadrants and 3 images were
captured (from quadrants 1, 5, and 9). All fibres were assessed
using the G-ratio plugin in ImageJ processing software. The G-ratio
was calculated using the equation G 5

Cannabidiol
(2-[(1R,6R)-3-methyl-6-(1-methylethenyl)-2-cycloh
exen-1-yl]-5-pentyl-1,3-benzenediol) was obtained from Tocris
Bioscience (Bio-Techne, Abingdon, United Kingdom). AM281
(CB1 receptor antagonist; 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-
4-methyl-N-4-morpholinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide) and
AM630 (CB2 receptor antagonist; 6-iodo-2-methyl-1-(2-morph
olin-4-ylethyl)indol-3-yl]-(4-methoxyphenyl)methanone) were
obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). SB-366791
(N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamide), rhodamine 6G, cre-
mophor, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), urethane, and MIA were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Solutions of CBD,
AM281, AM630, and SB-366791 were prepared in vehicle (1:1:
18; DMSO:cremophor:saline) on the day of use. Rhodamine 6G
(0.05%) and MIA were dissolved in saline. Physiological buffer

2.8. Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as mean 6 SEM. Data were tested for
Gaussian distribution by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. All data were
normally distributed and were therefore analysed using parametric
statistics (2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), 1-way ANOVA,
unpaired 2-tailed Student t test, and paired 2-tailed Student t test). A
P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Effect of acute administration of cannabidiol on joint
afferent mechanosensitivity
A total of 17 afferent fibres were recorded in this study. Fibres
were characterised based on mechanical and electrical thresh-
old, and conduction velocity (summarised in Table 1).
On days 14 to 19 post-MIA induction, close i.a. administration
of CBD rapidly reduced noxious movement-evoked firing of
knee afferent fibres (Fig. 1A) in a dose-dependent manner
(P , 0.0001; n 5 8, Fig. 1B). The desensitising effect of 300 mg
CBD during noxious joint rotation was significant at 3 minutes
after drug application and reached a maximum anti-nociceptive

 effect at 7 minutes (29.3% 6 7.4% change compared with
baseline). Although all doses of CBD significantly decreased the
mean afferent firing over the course of the 15 minutes assessed,
the 300 mg dose was the most effective, decreasing firing by
22.8% 6 1.2% overall (P , 0.0001, n 5 8, Fig. 1C).
3.2. Effect of acute administration of cannabidiol on sodium
monoiodoacetate–induced pain
Intra-articular injection of MIA produced secondary allodynia and
weight-bearing deficits in the ipsilateral hind paw and hind limb,
respectively, 14 days after injection (P , 0.0001; n 5 24; Fig. 2A
and P , 0.0001; n 5 24; Fig. 2B).
When compared with vehicle control, low dose CBD (100,
200 mg) had no effect on withdrawal threshold or hind limb weight
bearing (P . 0.05; n 5 8; Figs. 2A and B). The 300 mg dose of
CBD, however, significantly increased hind paw withdrawal
threshold and hind limb weight bearing over the time course
tested (P , 0.0001; n 5 8; Figs. 2A and B). All subsequent
experiments used the 300 mg dose of CBD.
To determine whether CBD was acting locally, 300 mg of the
drug was injected into the contralateral knee and the withdrawal
threshold was assessed in the ipsilateral joint 1 hour later and hind
limb weight bearing was assessed in the ipsilateral joint 3 hour later.
It was found that the high dose of CBD administered to the
contralateral knee had no effect on ipsilateral hind paw withdrawal
thresholds indicating that CBD was not acting centrally in this pain
test (P , 0.01; n 5 8-10; Fig. 3A). However, in the hind limb
weight-bearingtest, contralateral CBD was not statistically different
from the ipsilateral CBD group (P . 0.05; n 5 8-22; Fig. 3B).
The cannabinoid receptor antagonists AM281 and AM630 had
no effect on CBD-induced analgesia (P . 0.05; n 5 6-8; Figs. 4A
and B). Conversely, the TRPV1 antagonist, SB-366791, signif-
icantly inhibited the analgesic effect of CBD (P , 0.05; n 5 6-8;
Fig. 4A) with respect to the hind paw withdrawal threshold, but
did not have a significant effect on hind limb weight bearing at 3
hours after injection (P . 0.05; n 5 6-22; Fig. 4B).
3.3. Effect of acute administration of cannabidiol on sodium
monoiodoacetate–induced inflammation
One day after i.artic. injection of MIA, rolling leukocytes (P , 0.0001;
n 5 6-12; Fig. 5A), adherent leukocytes (P , 0.0001; n 5 6-12;
Fig. 5B), and knee joint perfusion were all significantly increased
compared with na¨
ıve animals (P . 0.05; n 5 6-12; Fig. 5C).
After baseline recordings were completed on day 1 post-MIA
induction, topical administration of CBD (300 mg) significantly
decreased rolling and adherent leukocytes when compared with
vehicle over the 3-hour time course (P , 0.0001; n 5 6; Figs. 5A
and B). Cannabidiol had a moderate inhibitory effect on synovial
hyperaemia (P , 0.05; n 5 6; Fig. 5C). The MAP was
unaffected by CBD treatment over the 3-hour time course
Figure 2. Dose-dependent effect of CBD on pain-related measures in established OA. Intra-articular injection of MIA produced secondary allodynia and weight-
bearing deficits in the ipsilateral hind paw and hind limb, respectively, 14 days after MIA injection (****P , 0.0001, 1-way ANOVA with Dunnett post hoc test; n 5
24). Cannabidiol (100, 200, or 300 mg i.artic. at BL]) improved hind paw withdrawal threshold (A) and hind limb weight bearing dose-dependently, over 4 hours.

 (VEH: 70.7 6 2.33 mm Hg; CBD: 68.8 6 2.38 mm Hg),
confirming a lack of any systemic effect on blood pressure.
The anti-rolling effect of CBD at 30 minutes was blocked by
AM630 and SB-366791 (P , 0.0001, n 5 6; Fig. 6A), but not
AM281. The anti-adherence effect of CBD on day 1 MIA joints
was blocked only by SB-366791(P , 0.001 n 5 6; Fig. 6B).
3.4. Prophylactic effect of cannabidiol on sodium
monoiodoacetate–induced osteoarthritis pain
Prophylactic treatment of MIA-injected knee joints with CBD (on
days 0–3 of MIA) significantly attenuated the development of
MIA-induced tactile allodynia during both the acute and late
phase of OA development (P , 0.0001; n 5 8; Fig. 7A).
Conversely, early treatment with CBD had no effect on hind limb
weight bearing, when compared with vehicle-treated animals
(P . 0.05; n 5 8; Fig. 7A).
3.5. Cannabidiol prophylaxis and sodium
monoiodoacetate–induced peripheral nerve damage
Treatment of OA knees with CBD during the acute inflammatory
phase of the MIA model (days 0–3 of MIA) inhibited saphenous
nerve demyelination on day 14 compared with vehicle-treated
knees (P , 0.05; n 5 6-8; Fig. 8B).
4. Discussion
Pain and disease progression are poorly managed in many
patients with OA because of the multifactorial nature of the
disease. Intra-articular injection of MIA produces monoarthritis
with several features that resemble human OA, including joint
pain, intermittent inflammation, and joint nerve damage. This
study aimed to address, for the first time, whether the
inflammatory and neuropathic pain associated with MIA could
be blocked by local administration of the noneuphoria producing
phytocannabinoid CBD.
It has previously been shown that the pain associated with the
MIA model of OA is mediated in part by the sensitisation of joint
afferent fibres.35,37 Peripheral administration of CBD dose-
dependently decreased joint afferent firing on day 14 after MIA
injection. These electrophysiology data confirm that CBD has
a peripheral site of action in knee joints. Because all recordings
were made from Ad or C fibres during noxious movement of the
knee, this suggests that CBD can inhibit the mechanosensitivity
of joint nociceptors.
In end-stage OA, intra-articular injection of 300 mg of CBD
improved unrestrained hind limb weight bearing and hind paw
withdrawal threshold (Fig. 2). These observations, along with
our electrophysiology data, assert that CBD acts locally in the
joint to reduce joint mechanical pain as revealed by improved
weight bearing as well as a reduction in centrally mediated
secondary allodynia as determined by hind paw withdrawal
threshold. Contralateral injection of CBD had no discernible
effect on ipsilateral secondary allodynia confirming that the
analgesic effect of intra-articular CBD was localised to the site of
administration for this pain test. The anti-nociceptive effect of
low dose CBD (100 and 200 mg) observed with electrophysi-
ology was not seen in the behavioural pain assessments. This
may be because electrophysiology is a highly sensitive
technique that detects subtle response to test agents in the
periphery, whereas pain behaviours are more complex and
encompass the entire pain pathway. The rationale for using two
pain behavioural tests in this study was to interrogate different
aspects of the pain pathway. Dynamic incapacitance is
a measure of spontaneous pain that is associated with joint
degeneration or inflammation arising from peripheral sensitisa-
tion.4,28 In contrast, von Frey hairs were used to investigate
evoked, reflexive responses (ie, paw withdrawal, shake, and
lick) at a site distal to the injured joint.28 This secondary allodynia
is a consequence of central sensitisation in late stages of the
MIA model,16 and can be indicative of nerve injury. Thus, it
seems that local injection of CBD is effective at reducing direct
nociceptive and inflammatory pain in the joint as well as
ameliorating neuropathic features of OA pain.
Both CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists failed to block the
CBD-mediated improvements in hind paw withdrawal threshold
and weight bearing. Although CBD has been shown to act as an
inverse agonist at CB2 receptors and a full antagonist at CB1
receptors,40 it has also been shown to act through GPR55,
serotonin receptors (eg, 5-HT1A), and various transient receptor
potential ion channels. Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 is
known to be involved in MIA-induced peripheral sensitisation,17
therefore, antagonist experiments were performed to test the
involvement of this ion channel in CBD-mediated analgesia. Here,
the TRPV1 antagonist SB-366791 attenuated the secondary
allodynia imparted by CBD in established OA. This mechanism of
action has been previously reported in in vitro studies using
human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells and using cell
membranes from mouse and rat brains.3 In vivo, TRPV1
antagonism has also been shown to block the pain-relieving
effect of CBD in a model of carrageenan-induced paw oedema7
Figure 4. Contribution of cannabinoid and noncannabinoid receptors to the analgesic effects of CBD. Both hind paw withdrawal threshold (A) and hind limb weight
bearing (B) were unaltered compared with control after local administration of the CB1 receptor antagonist AM281 (75 mg) or CB2 receptor antagonist AM630 (75
mg). Hind paw withdrawal threshold (A) was reduced compared with control after local administration of the TRPV1 antagonist SB-366791 (30 mg), but hind limb
weight bearing (B) was unaffected. (*P , 0.05, **P , 0.01 1-way ANOVA with Fisher post hoc test; n 5 6-8). Data are mean values 6 SEM. ANOVA, analysis of

 and in the chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain.6
Although these data show that the action of CBD is mediated in
part by TRPV1, it remains unclear if CBD is acting directly on
TRPV1 or if there is an indirect mechanism occurring in the joint.
Cannabidiol has been shown to inhibit fatty acid amide hydrolase
(FAAH) and the uptake of anandamide.3 Inhibition of FAAH and
anandamide reuptake would elevate anandamide levels in the
joint which if high enough could ultimately lead to the activation of
TRPV1.3
Intra-articular injection of MIA produced an acute inflammatory
response on day 1 after injection. This acute phase of
inflammation was evinced by an increase in leukocyte trafficking
and a moderate increase in joint blood flow. Local application of
CBD significantly reduced these acute, inflammatory changes
corroborating what has previously been reported in other
inflammatory models.8,12,20 Oral administration of CBD, for
example, has been shown to be anti-inflammatory and anti-
hyperalgesic in the carrageenan model of plantar oedema.8
Malfait et al., showed that systemic administration of CBD, both
intraperitoneally and orally, suppressed disease severity and
decreased serum inflammatory cytokine levels in the collagen
model of rheumatoid arthritis.20 Moreover, CBD administered by
a transdermal gel reduced joint swelling, immune cell infiltration,
synovial membrane thickening, and the synthesis of pro-
inflammatory biomarkers in the Freund complete adjuvant model
of inflammatory arthritis.12 The data presented here demonstrate
for the first time that CBD has the capacity to reduce the
inflammatory flares associated with OA.
The inhibitory effect of CBD on leukocyte trafficking was blocked
by the TRPV1 antagonist SB-366791. Opening of TRPV1 ion
channels causes the peripheral release of inflammatory neuro-
peptides which promote neurogenic inflammation and enhanced
leukocyte trafficking in joints.19,41 Thus, the anti-inflammatory
effects of CBD observed here could be due to desensitisation of
TRPV1 ion channels as has been shown elsewhere.14 The anti-
rolling effect of CBD on joint leukocytes was also blocked by
AM630 suggesting that CB2 receptors may be involved in
opposing leukocyte capture in day 1 MIA joints. Zhao et al. showed
that activation of CB2 receptors can inhibit the expression of P-
selectin which is the adhesion molecule responsible for leukocyte
rolling.43 Whether CBD inhibits joint P-selectin activity by a CB2
receptor mechanism requires further investigation.
A central hypothesis of this study was that early inhibition of OA-
related inflammation with CBD would reduce the development of
persistent joint pain. Prophylactic treatment of OA joints with CBD
on days 1 to 3 after MIA induction prevented secondary allodynia at
day 14, but had no effect on hind limb weight bearing. Inflammation
associated with MIA diminishes by day 7,4 therefore the pain
associated with end-stage OA in this model is largely due to joint
degeneration and peripheral neuropathy. Thus, by abolishing early
inflammation with prophylactic treatment, CBD attenuates central
sensitisation and neuropathic pain development in OA.
Previous studies have shown that MIA-induced OA causes
peripheral nerve damage.25,39 Demyelination of the ipsilateral
saphenous nerve was confirmed by an increase in G-ratio,
purporting MIA-induced peripheral neuropathy compared with
saline control animals.25 This study showed that prophylactic
treatment with CBD during the early inflammatory phase of MIA
prevented this loss of nerve myelin 14 days later, suggesting that
blockade of inflammatory flares during OA could protect against
joint nerve damage. The G-ratio data would benefit from future
studies examining the expression of a biomarker for peripheral
nerve damage to further support this finding.
The findings presented here and elsewhere support the concept
that MIA recapitulates the neuropathic aspect of OA pain, which is
found in approximately 30% of patients.1,34 CBD treatment may be
a beneficial therapeutic for the population of patients who
experience neuropathic arthritis, and are refractory to currently
used first- and second-line analgesics. Several cannabis com-
pounds, including CBD, have been shown to be neuroprotective in
other musculoskeletal disorders. In a preclinical model of multiple
sclerosis, CBD was shown to improve clinical recovery and rotarod
scores in animals, correlating with and indicative of a neuro-
protective effect.30 In addition, CBD and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
have both been implicated in slowing the progression and
promoting the survival of neurones in a preclinical model of

 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.15,42 These studies, in addition to the
results presented here, highlight the potential utility of CBD as an
analgesic and neuroprotective agent in OA.
Cannabidiol is a noneuphoria producing compound and has
a more desirable side effect profile compared with other
cannabinoid compounds and commonly prescribed analgesics.
Animal studies where CBD was administered systemically
showed that the animals had no signs of adverse side effects.12,20
For example, exploratory behaviour in rats was not altered by
systemic CBD, indicating limited central effects of treatment.12
Our study shows for the first time that CBD is an effective anti-
nociceptive and anti-inflammatory agent when administered
locally around the joint. Successful relief of OA symptoms by
peripherally administered CBD suggests a therapeutic option that
has a low chance of adverse effects which is more desirable for
patients.

 5. Conclusions
This study showed for the first time that local CBD administration
inhibited pain and peripheral sensitisation in established OA. Topical
treatment with CBD reduced leukocyte trafficking and joint hyper-
aemia during the early stages of MIA. By attenuating this initial
inflammatory response with CBD, end-stage OA pain and
peripheral neuropathy were abrogated. Thus, CBD may be a safe
therapeutic to treat OA pain locally as well as block the acute
inflammatory flares that drive disease progression and joint
neuropathy.
