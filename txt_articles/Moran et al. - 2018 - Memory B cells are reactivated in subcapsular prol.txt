Vaccine-induced immunity depends on the generation of memory B cells (MBC). However,
where and how MBCs are reactivated to make neutralising antibodies remain unknown. Here
we show that MBCs are prepositioned in a subcapsular niche in lymph nodes where, upon
reactivation by antigen, they rapidly proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting
plasma cells in the subcapsular proliferative foci (SPF). This novel structure is enriched for
signals provided by T follicular helper cells and antigen-presenting subcapsular sinus mac-
rophages. Compared with contemporaneous secondary germinal centres, SPF have distinct
single-cell molecular signature, cell migration pattern and plasma cell output. Moreover, SPF
are found both in human and mouse lymph nodes, suggesting that they are conserved
throughout mammalian evolution. Our data thus reveal that SPF is a seat of immunological
memory that may be exploited to rapidly mobilise secondary antibody responses and improve
vaccine efficacy.

he concept of immunity dates back to Ancient Greece, with
the description by Thucydides in 430BC of the protection
afforded to survivors of the Plague of Athens from sub-
sequent reinfection. Since then, vaccines have been empirically
developed to harness this power of the immune system to
remember past exposures to infectious organisms, and humoral
immunity against common viral and vaccine antigens have been
shown to provide life-long protection against reinfection1. This
protection is mediated by neutralising antibodies secreted by
long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and by memory B cells (MBCs)
that proliferate and differentiate more rapidly than naive B cells
into antibody-secreting plasma cells upon re-exposure to the
antigen2. However, despite recent advances in our understanding
of MBC heterogeneity, location and functional specialisation3, the
precise question of where they are localised in lymph nodes and
how they are reactivated to secrete neutralising antibodies is
unknown.
MBCs are strategically positioned outside the B cell follicle at
potential sites of antigen drainage, such as the lung following viral
infection, the marginal zone in the spleen, the bone marrow and
the mucosal epithelium in tonsils (reviewed in ref.3). In addition,
MBCs accumulate in draining lymph nodes following sub-
cutaneous immunisation4,
where IgG1+ MBCs have been
reported to localise adjacent to contracted GCs, whereas IgM+
MBCs are scattered throughout the follicle5. The relationship
between these tissue resident MBCs and those recirculating in the
peripheral blood are still unclear, although a recent study suggests
that they are distinct cell types6.
In the lymph node, the immune response pathways for naive B
cell activation in the primary antibody response have been
extensively studied. CD169+ subcapsular sinus (SCS) macro-
phages sample the lymph and present captured antigen on their
surface to activate naive B cells7–10. Activated B cells migrate to
the T-B border11–13 or interfollicular zone14 to acquire T cell
help, undergo CD40L-dependent proliferation15 and differentiate
into either extrafollicular short-lived plasma cells, or follicular
germinal centre (GC) B cells.
Here, we use intravital two-photon microscopy and single-cell
RNA sequencing to deconvolute the secondary antibody response
and show that the seat of B cell memory lies in a novel
structure we have termed the subcapsular proliferative foci (SPF).
Reactivated MBCs are shown to proliferate and differentiate into
short-lived plasma cells in the SPF, which is anatomically and
functionally distinct from the GC. SPF cells differ from GC B cells
in terms of their motility, migratory behaviour, single-cell
molecular signatures and dependence on BCR signalling for
survival. Importantly,
we describe similar microanatomical
structures in lymph nodes from patients, demonstrating that this
is an evolutionarily conserved immune response pathway.
Results
Resting MBCs reside in a subcapsular niche. To determine the
immune response pathways involved in MBC reactivation, we
adoptively transferred SWHEL B cells16 expressing the optical
highlighter Kaede17 and OT2 T cells18, and immunised reci-
pient mice with the cognate antigen hen egg lysozyme (HEL)
conjugated to ovalbumin (OVA). Mice were analysed >28 days
later when the primary antibody response has resolved and
antigen-specific cells are no longer proliferating (Supplemen-
tary Figure 1). After this time point, there are no persisting
GCs, as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis (Supplementary Figure 1). MBCs are able to
survive independent of antigen-derived BCR signals19 and T
cell help20,21, unlike GC B cells which are dependent on
both22,23. T cell depletion experiments and inducible deletion of
MHCII in responding B cells had no impact on the survival of
these cells >28 days after primary immunisation (Supplemen-
tary Figure 1). Furthermore, inhibition of BCR signalling with
the small molecule ibrutinib also did not impact on their sur-
vival (Supplementary Figure 1). Finally, these cells consisted of
IgM+ and IgG+ cells that expressed Fas, CD80, CD86, PD-L2,
CCR6, CD69, CD62L, EBI2 and CXCR3, but not S1PR1 (Sup-
plementary Figure 2), consistent with the phenotype of murine
MBCs24. Taken together, these data confirm that antigen-
specific cells persisting >28 days after primary immunisation
were bona fide MBCs and not GC B cells.
Analysis
of
whole-mount
lymph
nodes
by
two-photon
microscopy (TPM) 70 days later revealed that while B cells were
detectable in the follicle as deep as 300 μm below the surface of
the capsule (Supplementary Figure 3), antigen-specific SWHEL
donor-derived B cells were preferentially positioned in the outer B
cell follicle, where they were closely associated with CD169+ SCS
macrophages (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Movie 1). This
localisation of MBCs near sites of antigen drainage is similar to
the positioning of follicular memory T cells that also patrol the
subcapsular region25.
To analyse the migration and behaviour of these MBCs by
intravital imaging, we set up recipient mice in which SWHEL
MBCs expressed tdTomato and adoptively transferred naive B
cells the day before imaging. This showed that MBCs, compared
to naive B cells, were largely confined to the subcapsular region
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Movie 2). Analysis of the cell tracks
and positions relative to CD169-labelled SCS macrophages
showed that at any particular point in time ~80% of MBCs were
located in proximity (<20 μm) to SCS macrophages (Fig. 1c). In
contrast, <50% of naive B cells in the imaging volume were
located in proximity to SCS macrophages. Time-lapse images
showed that MBCs made frequent serial contacts with SCS
macrophages, consistent with antigen surveillance behaviour
(Fig. 1d and Supplementary Movie 3). In addition, MBCs in close
proximity (<20 μm) to SCS macrophages had a decreased average
speed compared to MBCs further away (>20 μm) from SCS
macrophages (Fig. 1e) and MBCs had an increased arrest
coefficient compared to naive B cells (Fig. 1f). These findings
further support the conclusion that MBCs in the subcapsular
region are scanning SCS macrophages in search of antigen.
We next enumerated the number of MBCs and found that
there were twice as many MBCs in draining compared to non-
draining lymph nodes (Fig. 1g). To determine the residence time,
we photoconverted MBCs expressing the optical highlighter
Kaede and tracked the ratio of resident photoconverted to newly
arrived non-photoconverted cells in the lymph node (Fig. 1h).
This cell tracking showed that MBCs resided in the lymph node
with a half-life of 48 h (Fig. 1i), which equates to a lymph node
residence time of 69 h, compared to <24 h for naive B cells26.
These data show that MBCs preferentially accumulate in the
draining lymph node where they reside in a subcapsular niche
and interact with SCS macrophages.
MBCs and naive B cells present similar migratory behaviours.
Both naive and MBCs must search the lymph node for scarce
antigen to be able to respond efficiently. We therefore next
analysed the motility and migratory patterns of naive and MBCs
to determine if they employed similar search strategies. Inter-
estingly, cell tracking and image analysis showed that both cell
populations migrated with a similar median speed (Fig. 2a),
displacement (Fig. 2b) and meandering index (Fig. 2c). It should
be noted that we detected very small differences in these para-
meters (as measured by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov D statistic)
which were statistically significant because of the large number of

 cells that were tracked; however, these differences are unlikely to
be of biological significance (for details see Methods). Analysis of
the mean squared displacement (MSD) plot of the cell trajectories
(Fig. 2d) showed that both naive and MBCs migrated with an α
slope >1, consistent with a superdiffusive migration pattern.
Model fitting of the cell trajectories using multi-objective opti-
misation27 showed that the motility of MBCs and naive B cells
was best captured as heterogeneous correlated random walks
(CRWs) (Supplementary Figure 4 and Methods). Accordingly,
both had very similar representative track profiles (Fig. 2e). Thus,
naive and MBCs patrol the subcapsular region of the lymph node
using similar search strategies.
MBCs cluster in the subcapsular region. To determine if the
subcapsular region was also the site of MBC reactivation, we next
imaged the in situ immune responses to antigen recall. In this
instance, we adoptively transferred tdTomato SWHEL B cells and
cyan OT2 T cells and immunised with HEL-OVA to establish
fluorescent MBCs that can be tracked. Mice were re-immunised
>28 days later in the memory phase. On day 5 post-recall,

 populations were spatially confined to their respective micro-
anatomical compartments, and only rarely migrated into the
follicular mantle zone (Fig. 3b).
MBCs interact with Tfh cells in the subcapsular region. Inter-
estingly, the subcapsular region and follicular mantle zone also
contained a large number of secondary Tfh cells that migrated in
a pattern that was also best captured as a superdiffusive CRW
(Supplementary Figure 5). We have previously described the
presence of secondary Tfh cells in the subcapsular region where
they interacted with SCS macrophages25. However, in those
studies we did not image the B cell compartment. In the current
study, we show that these secondary Tfh cells also interacted with
B cells in this region, as evidenced by the frequent short-lived
contacts between cyan OT2 Tfh cells and SWHEL MBCs (Fig. 3c
and Supplementary Movie 5). These interactions are reminiscent
of the brief T-B entanglements described inside GCs during
primary antibody responses28,29, and suggest that these are pro-
ductive T-B collaborations. To further characterise these T-B
interactions, we also imaged the primary antibody response on
day 5, when both T and B cells have colonised the follicle25. These
data showed that the T-B interactions were similar in number
(Fig. 3d) and duration (Fig. 3e) between the primary and sec-
ondary responses. These data confirm that the subcapsular region
is a previously unappreciated site of T cell–B cell interaction.
MBCs proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells in SPF. To
further characterise the B cell cluster in the subcapsular region,
we harvested lymph nodes on days 3 to 5 post-recall for histo-
logical analysis. This revealed that cells in the subcapsular cluster
were cycling as demonstrated by staining for the proliferation
marker Ki67, a property they shared with cells in the GC (Fig. 4a,
b). We have therefore named this novel structure the subcapsular
proliferative foci (SPF). However, in contrast to the GC, there was
no staining for CD35+ follicular dendritic cells in the SPF. We
also noted that a large fraction of SPF cells demonstrated more
intense cytoplasmic staining for antibodies to HEL than GC B
cells (Fig. 4c), suggesting that they were antibody-secreting
plasma cells. To confirm this, we set up secondary antibody
responses with SWHEL B cells carrying the Blimp-1egfp/+ reporter
to identify plasma cells in vivo30. As early as day 3 post-recall,
analysis revealed large clusters of GFP expressing cells in the
subcapsular region (Fig. 4d). We also performed histological
analysis for Bcl-6 and showed that HEL-binding cells in the SPF
did not express this transcription factor, further highlighting their
differences from GC B cells (Fig. 4e, f). Thus, MBCs proliferate
and differentiate into plasma cells in the SPF.
Two distinct subpopulations of SPF cells. Close examination of
the migratory behaviour of B cells in the SPF (Supplementary
Movie 4) suggested that they were heterogeneous in terms of their
motility. Therefore we set up tdTomato SWHEL MBCs carrying
the Blimp-1egfp/+ reporter and re-immunised mice to determine
if there were differences in cell migration and if this tracked with
Blimp-1 expression. Indeed, we observed two patterns of B cell
migration in the SPF based on Blimp-1 expression (Fig. 5a, b, and
Supplementary Movie 6). Blimp-1+ cells were shown to be
rounded, largely immotile and arrested on the surface of SCS
macrophages, while Blimp-1neg cells were highly motile and
migrated with much greater speeds (Fig. 5c), displacement
(Fig. 5d) and meandering indices (Fig. 5e). Notably, the differ-
ences
in
these
parameters
were
both
biologically
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov
D
statistic)
and
statistically
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov p value) significant. Analysis of the MSD
plot of the cell trajectories showed that Blimp-1+ cells migrated
with an α slope <1, consistent with an anomalous subdiffusive
migration pattern (Fig. 5f). This search strategy has been sug-
gested to increase the probability of finding nearby targets, par-
ticularly in areas where the target is abundant31, as might occur
for antigen trapped by SCS macrophages. In contrast, Blimp-1neg
cells migrated with an α slope >1, consistent with a superdiffusive
migration pattern, similar to that for naive and MBCs in the
steady state (Fig. 2d). This difference in motility is apparent in the
xy displacement patterns of representative tracks from both
subpopulations (Fig. 5g). Nevertheless, model fitting of the cell
trajectories using multi-objective optimisation showed that the
motility of Blimp-1+ and Blimp-1neg cells could both be modelled
as inverse heterogeneous CRWs (Supplementary Figure 6 and
Methods). These data show that SPF cells could be separated into
two distinct populations based on their motility and Blimp-1
expression.
Single-cell RNA sequencing of the memory response. To further
delineate the composition of the secondary antibody response, we
performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 142 FACS-sorted
donor-derived SWHEL B cells on day 5 post-recall (Supplemen-
tary Figure 7). Of these, 122 cells passed sequence and cell QC.
Bayesian analysis of single-cell gene expression data revealed 8190
differentially expressed genes (Fig. 6a), and non-negative matrix
factorisation (NMF) established that responding B cells could be

 most robustly and reproducibly deconvoluted into three discrete
subpopulations (cophenetic coefficient = 0.999) (Fig. 6b). Popu-
lation 1 was characterised by expression of genes related to
somatic hypermutation, cell division and mitosis that are typically
associated with GC B cells such as Aicda, Mki67 and Ccnb1
(Fig. 6c, Supplementary Figure 8 and Supplementary Data 1).
Population 2 was characterised by expression of genes typically
associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress and antibody
secretion by plasma cells32 such as J chain, Spcs3 and Xbp1
(Fig. 6c, Supplementary Figure 8 and Supplementary Data 2).
Population 3 was characterised by expression of genes typically
associated with MBC trafficking and cell positioning in the outer
follicle such as Sell, Ccr6 and Gpr183 (Fig. 6c, Supplementary
Figure 8 and Supplementary Data 3). We next performed gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) to confirm the identity of these three
populations. This showed that population 1 was highly enriched
for genes associated with GC (Fig. 6d and ref.33), population 2 for
genes associated with plasma cell (Fig. 6e and ref.34) and popu-
lation 3 for MBC signature genes (Fig. 6f and ref.34). Thus, in
agreement with the intravital imaging, the SPF can be readily
resolved into plasma cells and a second population of SPF B cells
with features of MBCs by single-cell RNA sequencing.
Using differentially expressed genes from the single-cell
transcriptomic analysis, we were able to resolve these same three
cell populations by both surface and intracellular FACS analysis,
thereby enabling precise tracking of the SPF. Hence, population 1
were CD38lo cells that expressed low levels of immunoglobulin
and were Bcl-6 positive; population 2 were CD38int cells that
expressed intermediate levels of immunoglobulin and were Bcl-6
negative; and population 3 were CD38hi cells that expressed high
levels of intracellular immunoglobulin and were Bcl-6 negative
(Fig. 6g). Alternatively, population 1 could be identified by
surface staining as CD38loCD138negB220hiCCR6neg GC B cells;
population 2 as CD38loCD138+B220loCCR6neg plasma cells; and
population 3 as CD38hiCD138negB220hiCCR6+ MBCs (Supple-
mentary Figure 9). Notably, both population 2 and 3 expressed
CXCR3 and Sca-1 (Supplementary Figure 9) indicating that these
surface markers can also be used to discriminate between SPF and
GC B cells.
Pseudotime analysis of lineage trajectories. To further char-
acterise the relationship between these three cell populations, we
performed pseudotime analysis to infer their lineage trajec-
tories35. This showed that a large distance separated population 1
from population 2 and 3, which were closely spaced in pseudo-
time (Fig. 6h). Thus, in accordance with the imaging data,
responding B cells can be separated into GC and SPF cells, and
the latter separated again into plasma cell and SPF cells with
MBC-like properties. As plasma cells are terminally differ-
entiated, this pseudotemporal ordering also suggests the popu-
lation 2 plasma cells can arise from a subset of population 3 SPF B
cells. To further determine the origin of population 2 plasma cells,
we compared the secondary antibody response on day 5 and 7.
This showed that, consistent with their expression of CXCR3, the
plasma cells were short-lived and decreased between day 5 and 7
(Fig. 6i). At the same time there was an increase in the proportion
of population 1 GC B cells and no change in the proportion of
population 3 SPF B cells. This suggests that the plasma cells in the
SPF are unlikely to be derived from secondary GCs, as one would
expect a concomitant increase in plasma cells as the GC expands
and matures36. Thus, the imaging and single-cell RNA sequen-
cing confirm that short-lived plasma cells are generated from
MBCs in the SPF.

 vehicle control, this lead to significant reductions in all three cell
populations, indicating that SPF B cells and plasma cells, similar to
GC B cells, required T cell help for their development.
To delineate the role of BCR signalling in the maintenance of
the SPF response, we re-immunised mice and 2 days later, when
the SPF is established, administered the Btk small molecule
inhibitor ibrutinib (Fig. 7b). This resulted in a significant
reduction in the number of GC B cells, but had no effect on
the number of SPF B cells or plasma cells, suggesting that cells in
the SPF were not dependent on Btk-mediated BCR signals for
their survival. Since ibrutinib treatment had no effect on survival
of MBCs (Supplementary Figure 1), this suggests that Btk-
mediated BCR signalling is required for initial activation of MBCs
but not for the survival of MBCs in the SPF, whereas it is required
for survival of GC B cells. This is consistent with clinical data
showing that ibrutinib depletes pre-germinal centre B cells but
not isotype-switched memory B cells in patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia37. Since ibrutinib may affect the initial
activation of MBCs, we also administered ibrutinib before and
during activation of the secondary response (Supplementary
Figure 10). As expected, this resulted in a significant reduction in
the number of GC B cells as well as SPF B cells and a statistically
non-significant reduction in the number of plasma cells. Thus,
Btk-mediated BCR signalling is required for MBC reactivation
and the survival of GC B cells, but not the survival of SPF B cells
and plasma cells.
Finally, we asked if this novel structure was unique to the
mouse or if it is also present in human lymph nodes. Analysis of

 serial sections from inflamed lymph nodes revealed clusters of
CD138+ plasma cells in the subcapsular region in contact with
CD169+ SCS macrophages in 3/3 patients (Fig. 7c). This
distribution of plasma cells in the lymph node follicle of patients
with ongoing immune responses was strikingly similar to the
images of the SPF in murine lymph nodes (Fig. 4a).
Discussion
Long-lived humoral immunity is initially dependent on the
secretion of neutralising antibodies by LLPCs. In the event of
inadequate antibody titres, MBCs provide a critical second line of
defence by rapidly proliferating and differentiating into plasma
cells. It was previously noted that MBCs often localised to
extrafollicular sites that are exposed to antigen, such as the splenic
marginal zone, and that this efficient access to antigen was pro-
posed to contribute to the rapid kinetics of the secondary anti-
body response38. However, it is unclear what supporting cells and
structures are available in these sites to capture and present
antigen and also provide T cell help. Here, we have focussed on
the localisation and reactivation of MBCs in skin draining lymph
nodes following subcutaneous immunisation. Our data show that
resting MBCs preferentially accumulate in the draining lymph
node where they reside in close proximity to CD169+ SCS
macrophages that are specialised to capture and present antigen
to B cells39–41. This same niche is also occupied by follicular
memory T cells25, innate-like lymphocytes42 and NKT cells43 that
are similarly well-adapted to provide the co-stimulatory signals,
such as CD40L, and cytokines, such as IL-444, that are needed to
expedite the secondary antibody response. Notably, we show that,
upon antigen recall, MBCs cluster and organise into a novel
structure, the SPF, where antigen and T cell help is concentrated
to facilitate plasma cell differentiation.
To study the dynamics of MBC localisation and reactivation
in situ, we have established an experimental system in which,
after 28 days, the primary antibody response has resolved and
there are no persisting GCs. This was confirmed by the absence of
Ki67 staining, the CD38hi phenotype of the MBCs and their
survival independent of Btk-derived BCR signals and T cell help.
The survival of MBCs in our system following ibrutinib treatment
is in agreement with their antigen-independence19, but contrasts
with recent data showing MBC survival is dependent on Syk.
However, Btk only mediates active antigen-derived BCR signals,
whereas Syk mediates both active and ‘tonic’ BCR signals inde-
pendent of antigen, possibly downstream of its activation by Fc
receptors, integrins or C-type lectins45, and this may account for
the discrepancy. Consistent with this, Btk has recently been
shown to be dispensable for mature B cell survival46 and ibrutinib
treatment has been shown to deplete pre-GC B cells but not
MBCs in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia37.
Intravital imaging of resting MBC dynamics show that they
adopt a CRW and superdiffusive migration pattern, similar to
that for naive B cells. In a CRW, cells migrate with a directional
persistence or bias that may reflect the influence of chemokine
gradients. In this regard, it is notable that MBCs in the lymph
node express the chemokine receptors CXCR3, which is asso-
ciated with the positioning of cells in the periphery of the lymph
node47, EBI2, which is associated with positioning of cells in the
outer follicle48,49, and CCR6, which is associated with the posi-
tioning of cells near the SCS50. By using a superdiffusive search
strategy, MBCs are able to migrate over large distances and cover
large areas in short periods of time, and this optimises the

 efficiency of their search for rare cognate antigens51,52. Our data
also indicate that MBCs reside in the lymph node with a residence
time of 69 h; this lymph node retention is probably mediated, in
part, by their CD69 expression, S1PR1 downregulation and
desensitisation to S1P gradients53.
We show that upon re-exposure to antigen, MBCs clustered
and organised themselves around two transient structures, the
GC and the SPF. The SPF is a large surface that extends along the
floor of the SCS and consists of B cells, Tfh cells and CD169+ SCS
macrophages. Intravital imaging showed that B cells were spa-
tially confined to these two microanatomical compartments and
did not cross over from one to the other. Specifically, we did not
observe migration of cells from the GC into the SPF, suggesting
that SPF cells do not originate from the GC. Within the SPF,
secondary Tfh cells were observed to interact with B cells, indi-
cating that this is an important site for productive T cell–B cell
interaction. We have previously shown that follicular memory
T cells are activated by SCS macrophages and undergo rapid
intrafollicular expansion in the subcapsular region to generate
secondary Tfh cells25. Our new data suggest that these secondary
Tfh cells localise in the SPF to provide T cell help to SPF B cells.
While proliferation of B cells at the perimeter of the follicles in
the spleen had been previously described in the primary antibody
response54, under these circumstances naive B cells are still
required to migrate to the T-B border to acquire T cell help. Thus,
this efficient engineering of the secondary response, whereby
antigen and T cell help is concentrated in one site, contrasts with
the primary response, where naive B cells must first be activated
by antigen in the subcapsular region8–10 before they are permitted
to migrate to the T cell–B cell border15 and interfollicular
regions14 to acquire T cell help.
While both the GC and SPF were sites of proliferation, there
are several key differences between the SPF and the GC in terms
of location, structural organisation and function. Firstly, the GC is
located deeper in the B cell follicle, whereas the SPF is periph-
erally located just beneath the SCS. Secondly, unlike the GC, the
SPF is Bcl-6 negative and is not organised into light zones con-
taining FDCs and dark zones containing proliferating cells.
Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the SPF is a site of high
plasma cell output where up to 60% of the cells are plasma cells.

 In contrast, plasma cell output from the GC is very low due to
stringent quality controls that limit plasma cell differentiation to
<3% of the high affinity GC B cells55. These data suggest that the
function of the SPF is to rapidly generate large numbers of
antibody-secreting plasma cells in order to swiftly neutralise the
offending pathogen. On the other hand, the function of secondary
GCs is to further mature the BCR and generate high affinity
plasma cells, a process that may be too slow to prevent over-
whelming infection. Interestingly, SPF plasma cells express
CXCR3, suggesting that they are short-lived plasma cells32. This
was confirmed by the decline in plasma cells from day 5 to 7 of
the secondary antibody response.
Intravital imaging of cellular dynamics in the SPF revealed two
distinct cell migration patterns which correlated with Blimp-1

 expression. Blimp-1+ SPF cells were rounded and immotile and
migrated slowly over small search areas in a subdiffusive pattern.
In terms of search strategy, this behaviour has been suggested to
increase the probability of finding nearby targets, particularly in
areas where the target is abundant31, as might occur for antigen
trapped by SCS macrophages in the SPF. In contrast, a second
population of Blimp-1neg cells were highly motile and migrated in
a superdiffusive search pattern similar to that observed for naive
and MBCs in the resting lymph node. Deconvolution of the
secondary antibody response by single-cell RNA sequencing
showed that this population expresed Sell, Ccr6 and Cd38 and
shared gene expression signatures with MBCs. Thus, in addition
to plasma cells, our studies reveal that the SPF is also a site for
further MBC differentiation. It is interesting to speculate what
‘targets’ these MBCs are searching for in the SPF, whether it is
antigen or T cell help or other signals required to complete their
differentiation programme. These ‘secondary’ MBCs may be
similar to ‘early’ MBCs generated outside the GC in primary
antibody responses56 and it remains to be seen how they con-
tribute to B cell memory and humoral immunity.
A key question arising from our study is what determines the
MBC fate decision to enter the SPF or GC. Recent studies have
documented heterogeneity in the MBC pool in terms of immu-
noglobulin isotype and propensity to differentiate into GC B cells
or plasma cells. In particular, it has been shown that IgM+ MBCs
preferentially re-enter GCs and IgG1+ MBCs preferentially dif-
ferentiate into plasma cells57,58. This imprinting of the MBC
response also tracks with CD80 and PD-L2 expression59, and may
relate to increase expression of FOXP1 in IgM+ MBCs, which has
been shown to repress PRDM1, IRF4 and XBP1 to restrain plasma
cell differentiation60. However, these are generalisations and
indeed class-switched MBCs have also been shown to recycle
through the GC and further mutate their BCR61. Nevertheless, it
will be interesting to determine if immunoglobulin isotype also
dictates the SPF versus GC cell fate in future studies. Our data
from inducible deletion of MHCII on MBCs before antigen recall
indicate that development of the SPF, similar to the GC, is
dependent on T cell help. Interestingly, inhibition of BCR sig-
nalling with the small molecule Btk inhibitor ibrutinib selectively
decreased the number of GC B cells without affecting the number
of SPF cells. This suggests that, once established, the survival of B
cells in the SPF is independent of Btk-mediated BCR signalling.
Moreover, these data provide further support for the notion from
the intravital imaging that SPF cells do not originate from the GC.
This is confirmed by analysis of the single-cell gene expression
trajectories by pseudotime and changes in the cellular composi-
tion of the response on day 5 and day 7.
In summary, we have identified the SPF as a novel immune
response pathway for the reactivation of MBCs in immune ani-
mals. The efficient intrafollicular expansion and plasma cell dif-
ferentiation of antigen-specific MBCs in SPF, where antigen and
T cell help is concentrated, provides a previously unappreciated
mechanism for the rapid kinetics of the secondary antibody
response. Importantly, it is this rapid secretion of antibodies that
protects the host from reinfection, well before LLPCs derived
from secondary GCs are generated. These data establish the SPF
as the seat of B cell memory, and as an evolutionarily conserved
immune response pathway that may be targeted to improve
human vaccine efficacy.
Methods
Mice. SWHEL mice expressing a knock-in BCR against hen egg lysozyme (HEL)16
were maintained on a C57BL/6J or C57BL/6-SJL.Ptprca/a congenic background.
Mice expressing tdTomato were generated by crossing floxed tdTomato reporter
(007914; B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J)62 with ROSA26-Cre mice
that ubiquitously expresses Cre recombinase (003474; B6.129S4-Gt(ROSA)
26Sortm1Sor/J)63. Kaede (KD) transgenic mice (Tg(CAG-Kaede)#Kgwa)17, Blimp-
1gfp reporter mice30 and tdTomato mice were crossed to SWHEL mice to obtain
fluorescent SWHEL B cells on a C57BL/6J background. MHCIIfl/fl mice (013181;
B6.129 × 1-H2-Ab1tm1Koni/J)64 were bred with Cd79a.CreERT265 and SWHEL mice,
and maintained on C57BL/6-SJL.Ptprca/a congenic background. KD transgenic
mice, CFP transgenic mice expressing cyan fluorescent protein under the β–actin
promoter (Tg(ACTB-ECFP)1Nagy/J)66 and Thy1.1 congenic mice (000406; B6.PL-
Thy1a/CyJ)67 were crossed to OT2 TCR transgenic mice (B6.Cg-Tg
(TcraTcrb425Cbn/J))18, and maintained on a C57BL/6 background. C57BL/6 and
C57BL/6-SJL.Ptprca/a congenic mice were purchased from Australian BioResources
(Moss Vale, Australia). SAP-deficient mice (B6.129S6-Sh2d1atm1Pls/J)68 were
maintained on a C57BL/6J background. All mice were bred and maintained in
specific pathogen-free conditions at Australian BioResources. Animal experiments
were approved by the Garvan Institute of Medical Research/St Vincent’s Hospital
Animal Ethics Committee and complied with all relevant regulations.
Adoptive cell transfer and immunisations. OT2 T cells were enriched by
negative depletion with biotinylated antibodies for anti-B220 clone RA3-6B2, anti-
CD11b clone M1/70, anti-CD11c clone HL3, anti-CD8 clone 53-6.7, and SWHEL B
cells were enriched by negative depletion with biotinylated antibodies for anti-
CD11b, anti-CD11c, anti-CD4 clone GK1.5, anti-CD43 clone S7 (all from BD
Bisociences) and MACs anti-biotin magnetic beads (Miltenyi). Purity of CD4+ Vα2
+ OT2 T cells was typically 70–80% and B220+ HEL-binding SWHEL B cells >99%
as determined by FACs analysis. 2.5 × 105 CD4+Vα2+ OT2 T cells and B220+
HEL-binding SWHEL B cells were adoptively transferred into age and sex matched
6–9-week-old C57BL/6 or SAP-deficient recipient mice. Recipient mice were
immunised the next day by subcutaneous injection with 20 μg HEL-OVA in Sigma
Adjuvant System (SAS, Sigma) in the lower flank and base of tail. For memory
responses, mice that had been immunised were rested for at least 28 days and then
re-challenged with 40 μg HEL-OVA in SAS injected subcutaneously in the lower
flank and base of tail. HEL was conjugated to OVA323–339 peptide (CGGISQAV-
HAAHAEINEAGR) (Mimotopes/Genscript) using the SMPH cross-linking agent
Succinimidyl-6-([ß-maleimidopropionamido] hexanoate) (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) to generate HEL-OVA48.
Ibrutinib treatment. Ibrutinib (Chemietek) was dissolved in Captex 355 (ABITEC)
at 1.56 mg/ml. Greater than 28 days after primary immunisation, mice were
injected intraperitoneally twice each day with ibrutinib at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg, or
vehicle control. Draining inguinal lymph nodes were harvested 0.5 day after last
injection and analysed. In addition, mice were injected with ibrutinib or vehicle
control as described above twice each day for 5 days, and re-immunised as
described above on the third day of treatment. Draining inguinal lymph nodes were
analysed 0.5 day after last injection, 3 days after re-immunisation. In addition, mice
were re-immunised as described above and then, starting 2d after re-immunisation
were administered ibrutinib or vehicle control as described twice each day for
2 days. Draining inguinal lymph nodes were then harvested on day 4 after re-
immunisation, 0.5 day after last injection.
Tamoxifen treatment. Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100% ethanol
at 20 mg/ml then diluted 1/10 in sunflower oil to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml.
More than 28 days after primary immunisation, tamoxifen at 0.5 mg/mouse (250 μl)
or vehicle control was injected intraperitoneally once daily for 5 days. Mice were
rested for 1 week then draining inguinal lymph nodes were analysed or mice re-
immunised as described above. If re-immunised, draining inguinal lymph nodes
were then analysed at 4–5 days after re-immunisation.
CD4+ T cell depletion. More than 28 days after primary immunisation, 200 μg
anti-CD4 (GK1.5, BioXcell) or isotype control (Rat IgG2b, BioXcell) was admi-

draining inguinal lymph nodes were analysed.
Fiducial labelling for intravital two-photon microscopy. CD169+ SCS macro-
phages were marked in vivo by subcutaneous injection of fluorescently labelled
anti-CD169 clone SER-4 (UCSF Hybridoma Core) 14–20 h before imaging. GCs
were marked by by subcutaneous injection of fluorescently labelled anti-CD157
clone BP-3 (UCSF Hybridoma Core) 3–4 days before imaging25. Antibodies were
labelled with either Alexa Fluor 555 or Alexa Fluor 680 protein labelling kit
(Invitrogen), or CF680R protein labelling kit (Biotium) according to the manu-
facturers protocol.
Intravital two-photon microscopy. Intravital two-photon microscopy was per-
formed as follows69. Briefly, anaesthesia was induced in the mouse with 100 mg/kg
ketamine/5 mg/kg xylazine and maintained on anaesthesia on 1–2% isoflurane
supplemented with 100% oxygen via a nose cone. The anesthetised mouse was kept
warm on a customised heated SmartStage (Biotherm) set to 37 °C. The inguinal
lymph node and intact inguinal ligament was mobilised in a skin flap and fixed on
a base of thermal conductive T-putty (LairdTech) and PDMS polymer (Dow
Corning). The cortical surface of the lymph node was exposed by microdisecction
of the overlying fat and fascia layers under a stereomicroscope with low-level
illumination. A small rubber O-ring was used to stabilise the meniscus and in some
cases Immersol (Carl Zeiss) was also used. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss 7MP
two-photon microscope (Carl Zeiss) powered by a Chameleon Vision II ultrafast
Ti:Sa laser (Coherent Scientific). Images were acquired with a W Plan-Apochromat
×20/1.0 DIC (UV)Vis–IR water immersion objective. Excitation wavelengths used
were 810, 870 and 920 nm. Fluorescent images were acquired with a LBF 760 and
BSMP 760 to enable detection of far-red signals. Non-descanned detectors were SP
485 (blue; SHG and CFP), BP 500–550 (green; KD, GFP and CFP), BP 565–610
(red; PE and Alexa Fluor 555) and BP 640–710 (far-red; Alexa Fluor 680 or
CF680R). Typically, 150μm z-stacks were acquired in 3 μm steps. Image stacks
were acquired at 30 s time intervals for 30 min or 60 cycles. Tiles of the whole
lymph node were acquired with z-stacks of between 150 and 300 μm.
Two-photon image analysis and mathematical modelling. Raw image files were
imported into Imaris (Bitplane) software package. The image intensities and
thresholds were adjusted and a Guassian filter used to optimise signal to noise.
Non-motile SCS macrophages were detected by the spot detection function and
drift correction applied to correct for motion artefacts. Colocalisation between cells
of interest was calculated by creating a COLOC channel and the COLOC intensity
sum quantitated over the course of the movie. Cells were detected using the spot
detection function and automatically generated tracks were manually verified. The
proportion of cells in proximity (<20 μm) to SCS macrophages at each time point
over the course of a movie was calculated using the Spots close to Surface XTension
plugin (BitPlane). The distance of cells to the SCS macrophage surface was cal-
culated using the Immune Atlas Imaris plugin (http://www.matebiro.com/software/
immuneatlas). The speed of cells was extracted from the Imaris Statistics function.
The arrest coefficient was calculated as the proportion of time a cell slowed down
to less than 3 μm/min. The number and duration of interactions between T cells
and B cells in the primary and secondary response was quantified and verified
manually, and normalised for the length of the T cell track. In some experiments,
surfaces of SCS macrophages (based on CD169 labelling), SPF (based on CD169
and B cells clustering around them in the subcapsular region) or GCs (based on B
cells clustering deep in the follicle) were calculated and applied using the Imaris
Surface function. The follicular mantle (FM) was defined as the region in between
the GC and SPF, and individual tracks were then assigned in relation to the SPF,
FM and GC boundaries. Cell track spatiotemporal position data were extracted
from the Imaris Statistics function and motility parameters calculated and motility
models fitted27. Briefly, data from replicate experiments were pooled together.
Instantaneous velocities for time points within cell tracks of a given population
were pooled together and then plotted as empirical cumulative distribution func-
tions (the speed graphs). These show the proportion of the distribution lying at or
below a given speed; a proportion of 0.5 represents the distribution’s median. Net
displacement was calculated as the spatial Euclidean distance between first and last
observations of each track. A cell’s meandering index is its net displacement as a
proportion of total length travelled; a value of 1 indicates a straight line, zero
indicates identical starting and ending positions. MSD for a given time interval was
calculated, and the slope ascertained through linear regression. Time intervals up to
25% of the population’s longest duration track were investigated, to avoid biasing
towards slow, un-directional tracks that persist in the imaging volume. Displace-
ment data for a given time interval were extracted from anywhere in the track time-
series, i.e. time intervals are not absolute from time zero or first observation. Track
movements in the x and y axes were plotted for a representative sample of each
population’s cells. Track movements are shown relative to their starting positions,
centred on the origin. Each plot shows up to 40 tracks, representing a uniform
sampling of track displacements.
We make inferences of cell population motility dynamics by reproducing these
processes in silico through agent-based simulation. Six putative models of cell
motility were fitted to our in situ data, fully described in ref.27: Brownian motion, a
Lévy walk where agent speeds and durations are both drawn from Lévy
distributions, and four correlated random walks (CRW). The CRWs differ in their
treatment of all agents as statistically identical (homogeneous) or heterogeneous in
their individual speed and turn dynamics (allowing agents to differ in their
inherent speeds and directionalities), and either selecting translational and turn
speeds independently of one another or imposing an inverse correlation between
the two (inverse). Each motility model was realised in a 3D agent-based simulation
representing cells as non-overlapping spheres. Simulated space is boundless, but
spatiotemporal data are only recorded for agents residing within an artificial
imaging volume of identical dimensions to that in situ. All random walk models,
except Lévy walk, were simulated with a discretised time step of 30 s. Lévy walk
employed a 3 s time step to better accommodate this model’s variable walk
durations. Simulated cell spatiotemporal locations were recorded every 30 s for all
models, as with in situ imaging. Random walk model parameters best aligning
model and in situ motility are obtained using multi-objective optimisation, i.e.
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II)70. NSGA-II aligns
simulated with in situ cell motility by minimising differences in (1) distributions of
pooled cell instantaneous velocities (speeds), (2) distributions of pooled turn
speeds, extracted similarly to instantaneous velocity, and (3) MSD slopes. No single
set of model parameters perfectly aligns all three of these metrics, and NSGA-II
maintains parameter value sets representing optimal tradeoffs. Each parameter
value set is assigned a Λ value27 quantifying its quality in terms of delivering
equally good alignments across all metrics; low Λ values indicate superior
reproduction of in situ motility. Standard model selection techniques such as the
Akaike information criterion are inapplicable in this multi-objective, multi-metric
context. Instead, we balance goodness of fit against model complexity by
constraining the computational resource available for fitting; more complex models
must offer tangible and readily realised improvement of capture over simple
models within the computation available. NSGA-II parameters for model fitting
employ a population size of 50 executed for at most 40 generations (fitting is
terminated early if model overfitting is detected, see ref.27). Supplementary figures
show model parameters Λ distributions and report Kolmogorov–Smirnov
differences therein.
Time-lapse images were exported, compiled and annotated in Adobe
AfterEffects (Adobe), and movies converted using HandBrake (https://handbrake.
fr).
FACS analysis and single-cell FACS sorting. Draining inguinal lymph nodes
were harvested, dissected free of fat and fascia, teased apart with microforceps and
mashed through a 70 μm filter. Single-cell suspensions were then washed and Fc
receptors blocked with unlabelled anti-CD16/32 clone 2.4G2 before staining. To
detect HEL-binding B cells, cells were stained with saturating levels of HEL at 200
ng/ml, followed by HyHEL9 Alexa Fluor 647. For detection of HEL-binding IgG1+
B cells, anti-IgG1 staining was performed first and followed by blocking with 5%
mouse serum before subsequent staining for HEL-binding with HyHEL9, a mouse
IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Antibodies used for staining are shown in Supple-
mentary Table 1. For intracellular staining, cells were fixed with Fixation/Per-
meabilization buffer and antibodies stained in Permeabilization buffer
(eBioscience). Antibodies used for intracellular staining were: Bcl6-PE (K112-91,
BD Biosciences). Cells were filtered using 35 μm filter round-bottom FACS tubes
(BD Biosciences) immediately before data acquisition on either an LSR II SORP or
Fortessa (BD) and data analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Single-cell
FACS sorting was performed on a FACS Aria III into a 384 well plate (Biorad)
containing 3 μl of cell deposition buffer (0.05% 10× GeneAmp PCR buffer without
MgCl (Life technologies); 0.9% Superase-In RNase Inhibitor (20 U/μl), (Life
technologies); 0.9% RNasin® Plus RNase Inhibitor (40 U/μl), (Promega); Nuclease-
free water (Qiagen)).
Single-cell RNA sequencing. Single-cell cDNA was generated and amplified using
SMART-Seq® v4 Ultra® Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (SMARTer kit)
(Scientifix) at half reaction volumes. For each sample, 0.5 μl of 1:2,500,000 Sequin
RNA spike-in mixes71 were incorporated in the master mix before RNA dena-
turation step and cDNA was amplified for 23 cycles. NexteraXT kit (Illumina) was
used to generate libraries that were sequenced at 2×125 bp on the HiSeq2500 at the
Kinghorn Center for Clinical Genomics (New South Wales, Australia).
Bioinformatic analysis. Raw sequence reads were quality control assessed using
FastQC, and trimmed using Cutadapt. An index reference genome was created
by concatenating the GRCm38 assembly of the Mus musculus genome and the
RNA Sequins spike-in nucleotide sequence. Reads were pseudoaligned to this
index and transcript abundance was quantified using kallisto72. Pre-processing,
quality control and normalisation was performed using the scater package73 in
the R/Bioconductor statistical programming framework. Counts were converted
to log2 (counts per million + 1). Genes with zero counts in all libraries were
filtered from downstream analysis. Library size normalisation was performed
using scran74. Three populations within the 122 single-cell dataset were iden-
tified using the unsupervised consensus-clustering package SC375. Differential
gene expression between the three clusters was determined using an integrated
Bayesian hierarchical model, BASiCS76 with a FDR cutoff of 0.1. A matrix of all
the differentially expressed genes was then deconvoluted by NMF to identify

 metagenes for each population77. Pseudotemporal ordering and single-cell tra-
jectory analysis35 was performed in Monocle278.
Epifluorescence microscopy and quantification. Lymph nodes were snap frozen
in cryomolds with OCT (Tissue Tek). Overall, 7 μm sections were cut using a
CM3050S cryostat (Leica), transferred to PolySine glass slides and air-dried. Cut
sections were fixed in ice-cold acetone, dried and blocked with 30% horse serum
(Invitrogen), 3% BSA in PBS. Antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Sections were incubated with 200 ng/ml of HEL and detected with polyclonal rabbit
anti-HEL IgG (Rockland Immunochemical Inc) followed by goat anti-rabbit FITC
(Southern Biotech). Slides were visualised on a Leica DM5500 microscope. Images
were compiled and brightness and contrast adjusted in Adobe Photoshop. For
quantification, raw single channel image files were imported into Imaris software
and manual surfaces created corresponding to the SPF region (directly underneath
the capsule in the B220 + B cell follicle), the GC region (containing the CD35 + LZ
and Ki67 + DZ), and the FM in between the SPF and GC. These surfaces were
masked for channels of interest and spots on either total B cells (B220+) or HEL-
binding cells (HEL+) were then detected using the spot detection function and
staining intensity for HEL, Ki67 or Bcl6 calculated.
Human immunohistochemistry. Archived paraffin-embedded human cervical
lymph nodes from patients with head and neck cancer who had undergone lymph
node dissection as part of their routine patient care were stained for anti-human
CD169 (clone HSn 7D2, In Vitro Technologies) and CD138 (clone B-A38, Cell
Marque) according to the manufacturers protocols.
Quantification and statistical analysis. Data were analysed with Prism software
(GraphPad). For comparison between two normally distributed groups a one-tailed
unpaired Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction was used, and for more than two
groups we used one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple compar-
isons. Non-parametric data were analysed by Mann–Whitney U test. Differences
between multiple paired measurements were analysed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001. The scientific (D) and
statistical (p value) significance of differences in motility parameter distributions
(speed, displacement and meandering indexes) was assessed through the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic. This non-parametric test quantifies the maximum
distance between two empirical cumulative distribution functions, and is thus
sensitive to differences in distributions’ locations and shapes. D is the maximum
difference in the proportions of the two distributions lying at or below a given
value, and ranges from 0 (distributions are identical) to 1 (distributions do not
overlap).
Data availability. The single-cell RNA sequencing data are publicly available from
the GEO, accession number GSE 109984. Relevant data are available from TGP
upon request.
