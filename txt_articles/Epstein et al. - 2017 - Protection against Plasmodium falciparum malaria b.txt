Introduction
In 2014 approximately $2.5 billion was invested in malaria control, and there were at least 214 million 
clinical cases and 438,000 deaths caused by malaria, with infants and children in Africa bearing the 
greatest burden (1). Malaria is also a threat to travelers; the US Department of Defense has ranked 
malaria as its number one infectious threat. A highly effective malaria vaccine would be an ideal tool to 
BACKGROUND: A radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ) malaria 
vaccine, PfSPZ Vaccine, protected 6 of 6 subjects (100%) against homologous Pf (same strain as 
in the vaccine) controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) 3 weeks after 5 doses administered 
intravenously. The next step was to assess protective efficacy against heterologous Pf (different 
from Pf in the vaccine), after fewer doses, and at 24 weeks.
METHODS: The trial assessed tolerability, safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of direct 
venous inoculation (DVI) of 3 or 5 doses of PfSPZ Vaccine in non-immune subjects.
RESULTS: Three weeks after final immunization, 5 doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ protected 12 of 13 
recipients (92.3% [95% CI: 48.0, 99.8]) against homologous CHMI and 4 of 5 (80.0% [10.4, 99.5]) 
against heterologous CHMI; 3 doses of 4.5 × 105 PfSPZ protected 13 of 15 (86.7% [35.9, 98.3]) 
against homologous CHMI. Twenty-four weeks after final immunization, the 5-dose regimen 
protected 7 of 10 (70.0% [17.3, 93.3]) against homologous and 1 of 10 (10.0% [–35.8, 45.6]) against 
heterologous CHMI; the 3-dose regimen protected 8 of 14 (57.1% [21.5, 76.6]) against homologous 
CHMI. All 22 controls developed Pf parasitemia. PfSPZ Vaccine was well tolerated, safe, and easy to 
administer. No antibody or T cell responses correlated with protection.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated for the first time to our knowledge that PfSPZ Vaccine can 
protect against a 3-week heterologous CHMI in a limited group of malaria-naive adult subjects. A 
3-dose regimen protected against both 3-week and 24-week homologous CHMI (87% and 57%, 
respectively) in this population. These results provide a foundation for developing an optimized 
immunization regimen for preventing malaria.

prevent malaria in travelers and deployed 
military, reduce morbidity and mortality in 
infants and children, and eliminate malar-
ia from defined geographic areas through 
mass vaccine administration campaigns.
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites 
(SPZ) are the only immunogens ever shown 
to induce >90%, sterile protective immu-
nity against malaria (2–4). Until recently, 
this had only been accomplished by immu-
nization by mosquito bite. Manufacturing 
processes have now been developed for 
the production of aseptic, purified, vialed 
PfSPZ Vaccine (5). In the first clinical trial 
Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine administered sub-
cutaneously or intradermally was well tol-
erated and safe, but poorly protective (6). 
Studies in non-human primates indicated 
the vaccine would be protective if adminis-
tered by intravenous (i.v.) injection (6). In 
the second clinical trial, 5 doses of PfSPZ 
Vaccine administered by i.v. injection pro-
tected 6 of 6 (100%) subjects against con-
trolled human malaria infection (CHMI) with homologous (same as in vaccine) Pf parasites 3 weeks 
after final immunization (4). In a third trial, 55% protection was achieved at 14 months after a 4-dose 
immunization regimen (7).
The WHO Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap (2013 update) set a goal for the year 2030 of a 
malaria vaccine with protective efficacy of at least 75% against clinical malaria, and development of 
malaria vaccines that reduce transmission of the parasite (8). We have focused on establishment of a 
regimen that would protect at least 80% of individuals against all Pf infections and could be adminis-
tered with a maximum of 3 doses. Such a vaccine would meet all WHO objectives. To address these 
objectives, and to assess the efficiency and tolerability of administering the vaccine by direct venous 
inoculation (DVI), we designed a study in which numbers of PfSPZ/dose, numbers of doses, and inter-
vals between doses were altered. Protection was assessed at 3 and 24 weeks after the last immunization 
against homologous Pf parasite challenge and, for the first time to our knowledge, heterologous (differ-
ent genetically from parasites in vaccine) Pf parasite challenge. Furthermore, we assessed the efficiency 
and tolerability of DVI administration of PfSPZ.
Results
Genetic differences between P. falciparum isolates
Pf7G8 had been used in the 1990s to establish heterologous protection in volunteers immunized 
by the bite of irradiated mosquitoes carrying Pf sporozoites (9). To establish that Pf7G8 was rep-
resentative of a heterologous strain, we utilized whole genome sequencing data to estimate genetic 
distance between the vaccine strain, PfNF54, and Pf7G8, and between these and 19 clinical iso-
lates from Africa (Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material avail-
able online with this article; http://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.89154DS1). Comparison of 3D7 (a 
proxy for its parent PfN54) and 7G8 revealed 22,056 SNPs genome-wide, an average of 0.95 SNPs/
kb. 4,925 SNPs fall within a panel of ~106 validated, protein-coding SNPs. This number of SNPs 
relative to 3D7 is comparable to that from African Pf clinical isolates (Supplemental Figure 1). For 
13 selected pre-erythrocytic Pf antigens and vaccine candidates, non-synonomous SNPs in 7G8 
relative to NF54 were common in all genes, including 8 in the PfCSP gene (Supplemental Table 2), 
confirming the genetic differentiation between the two strains.

Study population
Forty-five immunized and 24 infectivity control subjects were enrolled. Subjects were recruited from the 
Baltimore–Washington, DC, area. Baseline demographics were balanced. Study volunteer demographics 
and baseline characteristics are presented by group for all enrolled subjects (Table 1). Both civilian and 
military personnel were included. Ten of the 30 subjects in groups 1 and 2 (33%) and 7 of the 15 subjects in 
group 3 (47%) were military members.
Forty-one of 45 subjects (91%) completed all scheduled vaccinations. In the 4.5 × 105 PfSPZ group (group 
3), all 15 subjects received all immunizations and proceeded to CHMI #1. In the 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ group 
(groups 1 and 2), 26 of 30 subjects received all 5 doses (were “fully immunized”) and were available for 
CHMI. Two additional subjects in the 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ group who did not receive all 5 scheduled immuni-
zations proceeded to CHMI. Of the 28 subjects immunized in the 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ groups who were avail-
able for CHMI, 14 were randomized to group 1 (homologous CHMI) and 14 were randomized to group 2 
(heterologous CHMI). Two subjects randomized to heterologous CHMI did not receive CHMI. Of the two 
remaining subjects who received 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ immunizations, one subject missed the last immunization 
and both CHMIs due to deployment overseas, and one subject discontinued from the study after receiving 4 
doses (Figure 1).
Randomization was performed using a random generator program (simple randomization). Subjects 
were informed by a study investigator of their CHMI group approximately 3 weeks prior to first CHMI. 
Infectivity controls, who did not receive vaccine or placebo, were not recruited and enrolled until the time 
of each CHMI; thus they were not randomized.
CHMI #1 at 3 weeks after last vaccine dose. Fourteen subjects in group 1 (13 of whom who were fully 
immunized) and 15 subjects in group 3 (all fully immunized) underwent Pf3D7 CHMI. There were 6 
Pf3D7 CHMI infectivity controls. A total of 5 fully immunized subjects in group 2 underwent Pf7G8 
CHMI. There were 4 Pf7G8 CHMI infectivity controls. One of the 5 vaccinees in the analysis population 
was bitten by only 3 Pf7G8-infected mosquitoes, and 1 of the 4 infectivity controls was bitten by only 4 
Pf7G8-infected mosquitoes. Six of 11 fully immunized subjects in group 2 and 2 of 6 infectivity controls 
did not undergo Pf7G8 CHMI due to poor mosquito feeding.
CHMI #2 at 24 weeks after last dose of  vaccine. Eleven subjects in group 1 (10 of whom who were fully 
immunized), 14 subjects in group 3 (all fully immunized), and 6 infectivity controls underwent Pf3D7 
CHMI. Twelve subjects in group 2 (11 of whom who were fully immunized) and 6 infectivity controls 
underwent Pf7G8 CHMI. One subject in group 2 was dropped from the analysis population because of 
non-compliance.
Protective efficacy
CHMI #1. Participants underwent CHMI #1 3 weeks after treatment with the final dose of vaccine (Figure 
2, Table 2, Supplemental Table 3, and Supplemental Table 4).
Group 1: Subjects received 5 doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ (homologous Pf3D7 CHMI). All 6 controls devel-
oped parasitemia with a median prepatent period of 11.6 days. Twelve of 13 fully immunized subjects did 
not develop parasitemia, providing a protective efficacy of 92.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 48.0, 99.8, 
P = 0.0003). The prepatent period in the one immunized subject who developed parasitemia was 13.9 days.
Group 2: Subjects received 5 doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ (heterologous Pf7G8 CHMI). All 4 controls 
exposed to the bites of 5 (n = 3) or 4 (n = 1) PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes developed parasitemia, with a 
median prepatent period of 11.9 days. Four of 5 fully immunized subjects exposed to the bite of 5 (n = 4) or 
3 (n = 1) infected mosquitoes did not develop parasitemia. The protective efficacy of this cohort was 80.0% 
(95% CI: 10.4, 99.5, P = 0.048). The prepatent period in the one fully immunized subject who developed 
parasitemia was 11.9 days. A fully immunized subject who was exposed to only 3 PfSPZ-infected mosqui-
toes was one of the 4 subjects counted as protected. One fully immunized subject was excluded from the 
analysis population due to non-compliance.
Group 3: Subjects received 3 doses of 4.5 × 105 PfSPZ (homologous Pf3D7 CHMI). Controls were the 
same as those in group 1. Thirteen of 15 fully immunized subjects did not develop parasitemia, providing 
a protective efficacy of 86.7% (95% CI: 35.9, 98.3, P = 0.0005). The prepatent periods in the 2 immunized 
subjects who developed parasitemia were 13.9 and 16.9 days.
CHMI #2. Participants underwent CHMI #2 24 weeks after treatment with the final dose of vaccine 
(Figure 3, Table 2, Supplemental Table 3, and Supplemental Table 4).

PfSPZ/dose at weeks 0, 8, and 16 with homologous CHMIs (group 3, which began immunizations 1 month after groups 1 and 2). Twenty-four subjects were 
enrolled as infectivity controls for the total of 4 CHMIs (2 homologous CHMIs and 2 heterologous CHMIs); each CHMI included 6 infectivity controls, except 
heterologous CHMI #1, for which only 4 infectivity controls were challenged. CHMI, controlled human malaria infection.

Group 1: All 6 controls developed parasitemia, with 
a median prepatent period of 11.6 days. Seven of 10 ful-
ly immunized subjects who underwent CHMI #2 did 
not develop parasitemia, providing a protective efficacy 
of 70% (95% CI: 17.3, 93.3, P = 0.011). The median 
prepatent period in the 3 fully immunized subjects who 
developed parasitemia was 15.4 days.
Group 2: All 6 controls developed parasitemia, with 
a median prepatent period of 10.9 days. One of 10 fully 
immunized subjects did not develop parasitemia, provid-
ing a protective efficacy of 10.0% (95% CI: –35.8, 45.6, 
P = 1.00). The subject who did not develop parasitemia 
was the subject who did not develop parasitemia in the 
first CHMI when exposed to the bites of 3 PfSPZ-infect-
ed mosquitoes. The median prepatent period in the 9 fully immunized subjects who developed parasitemia 
was 11.9 days. When comparing the prepatent period in the group 2 subjects who developed parasitemia 
with the controls, there was a statistically significant delay of 1 day (Wilcoxon rank-sum exact test 2-sided P 
= 0.005). One fully immunized subject was excluded from the analysis population due to non-compliance.
Group 3: Controls were the same as those in group 1. Eight of 14 fully immunized subjects did not 
develop parasitemia, providing a protective efficacy of 57.1% (95% CI: 21.5, 76.6, P = 0.042). The median 
prepatent period in the 6 immunized subjects who developed parasitemia was 14.0 days.
Results for the challenged population, including subjects who missed one or more immunizations, are 
presented in Supplemental Table 3. All protected individuals were negative for Pf parasites by real-time 
quantitative PCR (qPCR) on their visits 11, 18, and 28 days after CHMI. All individuals positive by thick 
blood smear (TBS) were positive by qPCR.
Antibody responses
PfCSP and PfSPZ. Antibodies against PfCSP by ELISA, PfSPZ by automated immunofluorescence assay 
(aIFA), and PfSPZ by inhibition of sporozoite invasion (ISI) assay in sera taken 2 weeks after the last dose 
of vaccine and just prior to the second CHMI (~24 weeks after last dose of vaccine) for the 3 groups are 
shown in Figure 4, A–C. The median response (bar with number) and those protected (filled symbols) 
and not protected (open symbols) are shown. The numbers not protected after CHMI #1 were so low that 
meaningful associations with protection could not be done. However, in group 3 the unprotected subjects 
had the lowest levels of antibodies to PfCSP, both less than 3,500 (Figure 4A and Supplemental Table 4). 
Since there were only 2 unprotected subjects, meaningful statistical analysis could not be done. Antibodies 
diminished between the last dose and the 24-week CHMI. The geometric mean (GM) half-life of PfCSP 
antibodies in groups 1 and 2 was 17.81 weeks (n = 21, range 9.61 to 61.76 weeks), and in group 3 was 19.93 
weeks (n = 14, range 7.78 to 180.88 weeks). There was no significant association between antibodies by any 
assay (ELISA, aIFA, or ISI) prior to CHMI #2 and protection.
Approximately 77% of the antibodies to the rPfCSP in the ELISA were directed against the NANP 
repeat region of the PfCSP (Supplemental Table 5). By aIFA against PfSPZ, median IgG antibodies were 
11.2-fold higher than median IgM antibodies (Supplemental Figure 2). For all 33 subjects in groups 1–3 
who underwent CHMI 3 weeks after last dose of vaccine, median IgG antibodies to NF54 PfSPZ were 1.7-
fold higher than to 7G8 PfSPZ by aIFA in sera taken 2 weeks after the last dose of vaccine (2,668 arbitrary

Pf 3D7 parasites was analyzed in two immunized groups (group 
1 [2.7 × 105 PfSPZ]: n = 13; group 3 [4.5 × 105 PfSPZ]: n = 15) and 
one control group (n = 6) (A). Heterologous CHMI with Pf 7G8

Other antigens. Two weeks after the fifth dose in groups 1 and 2 and after the third dose in group 3, there 
were no antibodies to PfMSP1, PfEBA175, PfCelTOS, PfEXP1, or PfLSA1 (Supplemental Table 6). At the 
same time points, there were antibodies to, (a) PfMSP5 in 9 of 26 (35%) subjects in groups 1 and 2, and 12 
of 15 (80%) in group 3 (P = 0.009, Fisher’s exact test, 2-tailed); (b) PfAMA1 in 12 of 26 (46%) subjects in 
groups 1 and 2, and 1 of 15 (6.7%) in group 3 (P = 0.014); and (c) PfSSP2/TRAP in 6 of 26 (23%) subjects 
in groups 1 and 2, and 2 of 15 (13%) in group 3 (P = 0.687). Because of the low numbers of unprotected 
vaccinees, we could not establish whether any antibody responses were associated with protection.
Cellular immune responses
Cellular immune responses to stimulation with irradiated PfSPZ were assessed in PBMCs from fresh blood 
by FluoroSpot 2 (IL-2 and IFN-γ) 2 weeks after the first dose of PfSPZ Vaccine, 2 weeks after the last dose 
of vaccine (1 week before CHMI#1), and 23 weeks after the last dose of vaccine (1 week before CHMI #2). 
Responses were in general 1.5–3 times higher after the first dose than 2 weeks after the last dose of vaccine, 
but there were no significant differences between these time points. There were essentially no measurable 
responses 1 week prior to CHMI #2, 23 weeks after the last dose of vaccine; all of these responses were 
significantly lower than prior to CHMI #1 (Kruskal-Wallis test, all P < 0.0002). There was no clear asso-
ciation between these cellular immune responses to PfSPZ or Pf-derived synthetic peptides and protection 
(Figure 4, D–F, Supplemental Figure 3, and Supplemental Table 4).
Ease of administration, tolerability, and safety
DVI was rapid, required a single stick 96% (182 of 190) of the time, and was well tolerated. Subjects report-
ed no pain 73% of the time and mild pain 24% of the time (Supplemental Table 7).
Details of adverse events (AEs) are presented in Tables 3 and 4 and Supplemental Tables 8–10. Briefly, 
of the 66 solicited AEs reported within 7 days of immunization considered related, 61 (92%) were grade 
1 and 5 (8%) grade 2. No subject experienced a grade 3 or 4 solicited AE. All unsolicited AEs reported 
within 7 days of immunization were grade 1. The incidence of AEs was not increased in subjects who 
received 4.5 × 105 PfSPZ as compared to 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ (Supplemental Table 8). The incidence of AEs

P values less than 0.05. DStatistical tests for group 2 were performed hierarchically, with the test for CHMI at 3 weeks tested first and the test at 24 weeks 
tested second. The test for 3 weeks was statistically significant (P = 0.048). CHMI, controlled human malaria infection.

did not increase as subjects received additional doses of 
the vaccine (Supplemental Tables 9 and 10). 31 of the 
45 immunized subjects (75%) had at least one abnormal 
laboratory value within 7 days of an immunization, but 
there was no association with dosing schedule, size, or 
sequence (Table 4). Details on laboratory abnormalities 
are provided in Supplemental Table 11.
Discussion
An important first step in our development program is 
to optimize the immunization regimen for non-immune 
individuals who travel to malarious areas. Their risk was 
underscored by the recent deaths from malaria of two 
airline flight attendants after exposure of as little as 1 
day (10, 11). For this population we are aiming for a vaccine that is easy to administer, extremely well toler-
ated, and safe and at a minimum prevents all Pf erythrocytic-stage parasitemia in at least 80% of recipients 
for 3 months (short-term travel) and ideally 6 months or longer.
Our trial designs have been based on the hypothesis (Figure 5) that increasing the number of PfSPZ/
dose and altering intervals between doses will lead to moving from no or minimal protection to high-level 
(>80%) short-term protection against homologous parasites (threshold 1); high-level short-term protection 
against heterologous parasites (threshold 2); high-level long-term protection against homologous parasites 
(threshold 3); and eventually high-level long-term protection against heterologous parasites (threshold 4). 
In the first successful trial we reached threshold 1, but did not assess for thresholds 2 and 3 (4).
In this trial, short-term protection against homologous and heterologous CHMI was ≥80%. At 3 weeks 
after the last dose of vaccine, 92% of 13 subjects immunized with a total of 1.35 × 106 PfSPZ in a 5-dose 
regimen, and 87% of 15 subjects immunized with 1.35 × 106 PfSPZ in a 3-dose regimen were protected 
against homologous CHMI, reaching threshold 1. Furthermore, this trial gave us an indication that there 
was short-term protection (threshold 2) against heterologous CHMI. All 4 controls developed parasitemia, 
and 4 of the 5 vaccinees did not develop parasitemia (protective efficacy of 80%, 95% CI: 10.4, 99.5).
At 24 weeks after the last dose of vaccine, 70% of 10 subjects immunized with the 5-dose regimen and 
57% of 14 subjects immunized with the 3-dose regimen were protected against homologous CHMI, nearly 
reaching the 80% level required to achieve threshold 3. Furthermore, recent data indicate that if protected 
at 6 months, vaccinees will be protected at ~14 months (7).
However, only 10% of 10 subjects immunized with the 5-dose regimen were protected against heter-
ologous CHMI. Nonetheless, there was a significant difference in time to onset of parasitemia in immu-
nized versus control subjects (Figure 3), suggesting vaccine-induced immunity had prevented infection of 
or eliminated most liver-stage parasites (12, 13). Based on our hypothesis (Figure 5), in the next trial we will 
immunize with higher doses of PfSPZ in 3-dose regimens. If this is not as effective as expected, we may 
move to a vaccine containing a mixture of strains of Pf.
PfSPZ Vaccine was well tolerated and safe. A study done in Mali with the same dosage regimen with a 
blinded control group had the same incidence rates of AEs in vaccine and normal saline placebo recipients 
(Mahamadou S. Sissoko, Malaria Research and Training Center, Mali-NIAID ICER, University of Science, 
Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Mali; and Sara A. Healy, Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and 
Vaccinology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH; personal communication). In our

3D7 parasites was analyzed in two immunized groups (group 1

trolled human malaria infection; Pf = Plasmodium falciparum.

study injection by DVI took only 10–15 seconds after the injection site was prepared and caused no pain in 
73% of immunizations administered, mild pain in 24%, and moderate pain in 3% (Supplemental Table 7). 
Administration of PfSPZ Vaccine by DVI appears to be much better tolerated than vaccines administered by 
traditional routes, likely because all vaccine leaves the site of administration rapidly and there are no inflam-
matory components in the vaccine. In traditional administration, the most discomfort is experienced when the 
vaccine is injected and for several hours afterward. Most subjects who received PfSPZ Vaccine by DVI did not 
sense injection. This will be an advantage in mass vaccine administration campaigns, and in acceptability by 
infants, children, and travelers.
Through the mid-1980s it was thought that antibodies to PfSPZ, particularly to the PfCSP, that blocked 
sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes were responsible for irradiated SPZ-induced protection (14, 15). How-
ever, when it was shown that treatment of fully immune mice (6, 16–18) and non-human primates (19) 
with anti-CD8 antibodies eliminated the protective immunity, it was hypothesized that cellular immune 
responses against the developing liver stages were responsible for protection (16, 17, 20–23). We could not 
use statistics to assess correlations between antibodies and protection for CHMI #1, and there was no sig-
nificant correlation between antibodies and protection for CHMI #2 (Figure 4). This is consistent with our

Figure 4. Antibody and T cell responses in all immunized participants. For all assays, protected subjects are shown as filled (black) circles and unpro-
tected subjects as open circles. For each of the 3 immunization groups, the interquartile ranges and the median values of responses of subjects in each 
group are shown. Assessment of antibodies (A–C) was performed in sera from subjects before immunization and 2 and 23 weeks after the last dose of 
PfSPZ Vaccine, time points that were ~1 week before CHMI #1 and CHMI #2, respectively. Number of samples assessed in A–C for CHMI #1: group 1 (n = 
13), group 2 (n = 5), group 3 (n = 15); CHMI #2: group 1 (n = 10), group 2 (n = 10), group 3 (n = 14). (A) Antibodies to PfCSP by ELISA are reported as net OD 
1.0 (the difference in OD 1.0 between post- and pre-immunization sera). (B) Antibodies to PfSPZ by aIFA are reported as the reciprocal serum dilution 
at which the fluorescence units were 2 × 105 (AFU 2 × 105). (C) Percent inhibition of PfSPZ invasion is reported as the percent reduction of the numbers 
of PfSPZ that invaded a human hepatocyte line (HC-04) in the presence of post-immunization as compared with pre-immunization serum from the 
same volunteer, both at a dilution of 1:5. At both CHMI #1 and CHMI #2, all 3 assays correlated with each other (CHMI #1: PfCSP ELISA vs. aIFA, P < 
0.001, r2 = 0.61; PfCSP ELISA vs. ISI, P = 0.0002, r2 = 0.30; aIFA vs. ISI, P = 0.004, r2 = 0.19. CHMI #2: PfCSP ELISA vs. aIFA, P < 0.0001, r2 = 0.54; PfCSP 
ELISA vs. ISI, P < 0.0001, r2 = 0.56; aIFA vs. ISI, P = 0.0002, r2 = 0.34). Assessment of T cell responses by FlouroSpot assay was performed using PBMCs 
from subjects prior to immunization, 2 weeks after the first dose of PfSPZ Vaccine, and just prior to CHMI #1 and CHMI #2 (D–F). Number of samples 
assessed in D–F — 2 weeks after dose 1: group 1 (n = 8), group 2 (n = 5), group 3 (n = 15); pre-CHMI #1: group 1 (n = 13), group 2 (n = 5), group 3 (n = 15); 
pre-CHMI #2: group 1 (n = 10), group 2 (n = 10), group 3 (n = 13). Results are reported as spot-forming cells (SFCs) per 106 PBMCs secreting (D–F) IFN-γ 
only, (E) IL-2 only, or (F) IFN-γ and IL-2. Individual data points have the pre-immunization SFCs/106 PBMCs subtracted from the post-immunization

hypothesis that antibodies can reduce the numbers of PfSPZ that reach or successfully invade hepatocytes, 
but cellular immune responses directed against perhaps hundreds of antigens expressed in developing liver 
stages are required for the sterile protective immunity induced by PfSPZ Vaccine (4, 6).
The cellular immune responses delineated by the FluoroSpot assays peaked after the first dose, were 
lower after the last dose, and essentially absent at the time of CHMI #2. There was no significant asso-
ciation with protection. This may be because, as in non-human primates, the majority of PfSPZ-specific 
CD8+ cells are in the liver, where they can attack the Pf-infected hepatocyte, not in the blood, where we 
can measure them (6). Given that there has been association between T cell responses and protection as 
assessed by flow cytometry (4, 7), we are proceeding with such an analysis. The low levels of antibodies 
(Supplemental Table 6) and T cell responses (Supplemental Figure 3) against well-known antigens suggest 
that as-yet-undefined antigens may be critically important targets of this strong protective immunity, and 
these may be revealed by flow cytometry studies.
We believe CHMI with heterologous Pf strains will be adequate to predict protective efficacy in the field 
against heterogeneous Pf populations. This is supported by our study in malaria-exposed Malian adults 
immunized with the same regimen as groups 1 and 2 in this study, which conferred 28.5% sterile protection 
against highly heterogeneous naturally transmitted Pf for up to 6 months (M.S. Sissoko and S.A. Healy, per-
sonal communication) — several fold better protection than the 10% protective efficacy against Pf7G8 at 24 
weeks in the present study. Recent evidence has suggested that the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine induces strain-spe-
cific protection in the field (24). Only homologous CHMI has been used in the development and testing of 
RTS,S/AS01. It is likely that heterologous CHMI would have identified this deficiency early on. It is for this 
reason we have conducted the first heterologous CHMI, and will continue to use heterologous CHMI in the 
development of PfSPZ Vaccine.
Whole genome sequencing revealed that the genetic distance between the vaccine strain (Pf3D7, a proxy 
for its parent strain PfNF54) and Pf7G8, the two strains used for CHMI, was substantial (22,056 SNPs). Fur-
thermore, a targeted analysis of 13 known pre-erythrocytic antigens revealed that they all contain non-syn-
onymous SNPs between Pf3D7 and Pf7G8. Thus, we conclude that Pf7G8 is an appropriate parasite for 
heterologous CHMI.
By increasing the dose (Figure 5), we anticipate we will increase the magnitude of protective immune 
responses against all target antigens, and will expand the immune responses to be direct against subdominant 
protective and conserved epitopes. They are conserved because there is no immune pressure against these sub-
dominant epitopes, and this should allow for protection against all strains of Pf. We anticipate finalization of

a long-term protective regimen in the next trial, allowing us to move to 
phase 3 trials and licensure. The information from CHMI studies of 
PfSPZ Vaccine lays a foundation that supports trials designed to finalize 
a vaccine regimen for mass vaccination program campaigns in Africa.
Methods
Study oversight
The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and standards of Good Clinical Practice 
defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation of 
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.
The NMRC, WRAIR, and Sanaria (sponsor) collaborated on design. There was an independent safety 
monitoring committee (SMC).
Study subjects
Malaria-naive, 18- to 45-year-olds were enrolled during 2014–2015 after providing informed consent. Sub-
jects were excluded if they had a history of malaria infection, travel to a malaria endemic region within 
6 months of first immunization, or long-term residence (>5 years) in an area known to have transmission 
of P. falciparum. Subjects were also excluded if they had previously participated in a malaria vaccine trial. 
All subjects underwent a screening evaluation consisting of a medical history, physical examination, elec-
trocardiogram, complete blood count, clinical biochemistries, urinalysis, sickle cell testing, and serological 
studies for previous exposure to or infection with HIV
, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Subjects were excluded 
if they had hepatic, renal, or autoimmune diseases, allergy to any study component, splenectomy, or evi-
dence of increased cardiovascular disease risk (defined as >10%, 5-year risk) as determined by the method 
of Gaziano (25). All females had urine pregnancy test at screening, immediately before each immunization 
and before CHMI; they were to be excluded from further immunization or CHMI if this was positive. All 
female subjects agreed to use effective means of birth control for the duration of the trial.
PfSPZ Vaccine
Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine is a live attenuated whole parasite vaccine (26) stabilized in liquid nitrogen vapor 
phase (LNVP), and manufactured and characterized (Supplemental Table 12) as described previously (4–
6). Vaccine in 0.5 ml was rapidly (seconds) injected in an arm vein by DVI through a 25-gauge needle.
Study design
The study was open label and designed to assess the tolerability, safety, immunogenicity, and protective 
efficacy of DVI-administered PfSPZ Vaccine in 3 groups of 15 immunized subjects each. Thirty subjects 
were to receive 5 doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ/dose at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 20 and then were to be random-
ized equally to group 1 (homologous CHMIs) or group 2 (heterologous CHMIs). Fifteen subjects in group 
3 were to receive 3 doses of 4.5 × 105 PfSPZ/dose at weeks 0, 8, and 16, followed by homologous CHMIs.
Tolerability of DVI was assessed immediately after injection by the subjects using a pain scale (none, 
mild, moderate, or severe). Subjects were followed up in the clinic on days 2, 7, and 14 after each immuni-
zation. Solicited and unsolicited AEs were monitored for 7 and 28 days after each immunization, respec-
tively. Safety laboratories were assessed 2 and 7 days after each immunization. A TBS was assessed 14 ± 2 
days after the first immunization to rule out breakthrough infection. See supplemental material for details 
of AE recording and grading.
Figure 5. Threshold hypothesis regarding achieving >80% protective
efficacy with PfSPZ Vaccine. To move from minimal to no protection (6),
past Threshold 1 to short-term homologous protection (4), past Thresh-
old 2 to short-term heterologous protection (this trial), past Threshold 
3 to long-term homologous protection, past Threshold 4 to long-term, 
heterologous protection, all at >80% sterile protective efficacy, one must 
progressively increase the dosage of PfSPZ and optimize the number of 
doses and intervals between doses.

CHMI was conducted 3 and 24 weeks after the final immunization. Groups 1 and 3 underwent 
CHMI by bites of 5 Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes infected with Pf3D7 parasites (27), which are a 
clone of the NF54 parasites in the vaccine (presumed African origin) (homologous CHMI). Group 2 
underwent CHMI by bites of 5 A. stephensi infected with Pf7G8 parasites (South American) (heterol-
ogous CHMI) (28). As is standard for malaria vaccine trials in malaria-naive subjects with CHMI, for 
each CHMI there were non-immunized infectivity controls. From day 7 to day 18 after exposure to 
the bites of PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes, subjects spent evenings and nights in a hotel. AEs and TBSs 
were assessed at least daily from day 7 to day 18 after CHMI, and then again on days 20, 22, 25, and 
28 after initiation of CHMI or until detection of parasitemia as previously described (13). qPCR was 
done retrospectively (see supplemental materials for specifics) (29, 30). Clinical laboratory tests were 
also monitored. Upon detection of parasites, subjects were treated with a 3-day course of atovaquone/
proguanil (Malarone).
Assessment of immunological responses
Antibody assays. Sera were assessed for antibodies to selected Pf proteins by ELISA, and to Pf sporozoites 
by aIFA. Functional activity of sera was assessed by the ISI assay. See supplemental materials for specifics.
Cellular immunology assays. PBMCs were assessed for activity against PfSPZ and Pf peptides by Fluo-
roSpot assay (Mabtech). See supplemental material for specifics.
Assessment of genetic differences between P. falciparum isolates
SNP calling utilizing previously generated whole-genome short-read sequencing data was used to estimate 
genetic distance between the vaccine strain PfNF54 and Pf7G8, as well as between these and 19 clinical 
isolates from Africa (Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 1), with details described in the sup-
plemental material. Given the negligible difference (55 detectable SNPs) between the Pf3D7 clone and its 
parent, PfNF54, 3D7 (27) was used as a proxy for NF54 (31).
Statistics
Sample sizes for the groups were selected based on comparison of the number of immunized subjects 
per group versus 6 infectivity controls for each CHMI. Accounting for a dropout rate of immunized 
subjects of 20% (from 15 to 12 subjects), a sample size of 6 in the control group and 12 in the vaccinated 
group was selected to be able to show with a power of 80% without a continuity correction that if 5 of 
6 become infected in the control group and 2 of 12 become infected in the immunized group, the pro-
portion of subjects infected in the control group would be significantly different from the proportion of 
subjects infected in the immunized group (α < 0.05, 2-sided Fisher’s exact test).
Immunological analyses, differences in responses were analyzed by nonparametric tests.
Protective efficacy was calculated as 1 – (relative risk of parasitemia infection). Exact CIs for pro-
tective efficacy were calculated by inverting two 1-sided tests for the score statistic in StatXact 9 (Cytel 
2010, Cytel Studio 9). Statistical comparison tests of protective efficacy were performed using 2-sid-
ed Fisher’s exact tests comparing vaccinated subjects with controls within similar CHMI strains. The 
Hochberg procedure was applied to the comparisons of the 3D7 strain CHMIs (group 1 versus control 
and group 3 versus control for both CHMIs), for a total of 4 comparisons to preserve the overall type 
I error rate at 0.05 (32). A hierarchical testing procedure was applied to the comparison for the 7G8 
strain CHMIs (group 2 versus controls). Because a priori we believed that protection was more likely at 
3 weeks than at 24 (see Discussion and Figure 5), we planned to perform the 3-week comparison first 
at a type I error rate of 0.05 and, only if that was significant, use 0.05 for the 24-week CHMI. Analyses 
were performed on two populations: (a) the analysis population and (b) the challenged population. The 
analysis population consisted of fully immunized subjects who participated in the respective CHMI. 
The text of this article reports results for the analysis population. The challenged population consisted 
of all subjects who received the respective CHMI, regardless of the number of vaccinations received or 
compliance status. Results for the challenged population are shown in Supplemental Table 3.
Study approval
The IRB of WRAIR approved the protocol in compliance with applicable federal regulations. Written 
informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to inclusion in the study.
