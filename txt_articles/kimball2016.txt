Abstract: Trans-epithelial delivery of medication across the vagina has proven successful for 
administration of small, lipophilic molecules such as sex steroids. However, little information is 
available regarding the vaginal delivery of larger and more polar molecules that currently require 
parenteral administration reflecting the bias that vaginal epithelium is a barrier to absorption of larger 
molecular weight (MW) molecules. Six healthy women underwent administration of 18 or 36 mg of 
leuprolide, a GnRH agonist and a larger MW peptide, via a novel ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) ring 
transvaginal drug delivery system (TVDS). Serum levels rose within eight hours following insertion: 
low dose at 310 pg/ml and high dose at 1,220 pg/ml, i.e. levels typically following parenteral injections 
of leuprolide. GnRHa biological activity was validated by secretion of gonadotropins and sex steroids. 
These results demonstrate that the non-keratinized vaginal epithelium permits a rapid absorption of a 
biologically active peptide and that there is significant potential for a novel TVDS to deliver peptides 
and possibly other macromolecules therapeutically.

Significance Statement: Current routes of administration of medications can include oral, 
subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, transcutaneous, etc. Many of these approaches have 
limitations, including pain, poor tolerability, lack of adherence, and inadequate delivery. Peptides, in 
particular, cannot typically be given orally because they are broken down in the intestinal tract before 
they are absorbed. While the skin is an attractive way to deliver medications, its superb intrinsic 
barrier function often makes this route untenable at times. The vaginal epithelium, in contrast, is not 
keratinized and can allow absorption of other molecules. In this study, we demonstrate that a novel 
transvaginal drug delivery system (TVDS) is capable of delivering peptide therapeutics to women in a 
non-parenteral fashion as demonstrated by both blood levels and biologic effects of its delivery.  
Introduction:  
A major therapeutic limitation of peptide and protein treatments has been their requirement for 
intramuscular or parenteral administration. Consequently, transepithelial delivery of medications has 
been an area of substantial interest and research. Among the various cutaneous sites for such 
medication delivery, the vagina is a potentially favorable one not only for local but also for 
systemically acting drugs for several reasons. These include: a) dense vasculature; b) lack of 
squamous keratinization (a property shared only with the buccal mucosa, which is a site incapable of 
supporting long term administration); c) direct access to the systemic circulation; d) ability to 
circumvent the ‘hepatic first pass phenomenon’ inherent in oral administration; e) demonstrated 
permeability to sex steroids [1]; f) potential for high drug absorption capacity in a sustained release 
fashion for weeks to months [1]; g) minimization of daily medication administration compliance issues; 
and h) ease of use [2, 3].  
Despite these advantages, conventional wisdom is that vaginal administration is limited by the 
molecular size of the therapeutic agent(s) and their polarity due to size barriers inherent in skin 
epithelium [4].  Additionally, physiological variations of the vaginal epithelium throughout the 
menstrual cycle can affect both drug solubility and vaginal membrane penetration [1,5].  Despite 
these largely theoretical limitations, vaginal rings have proven quite successful in delivering small 
lipophilic molecules such as the naturally occurring sex steroids estradiol and progesterone for 
hormone replacement therapy and synthetic estrogens and progestins for contraception with

substantial market success in these two areas [6, 7].   
The normal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis critically depends upon the pulsatile 
secretion of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus [8]. In contrast, 
continuous GnRH administration or long acting Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone agonists (GnRHa) 
pharmacologically desensitize pituitary gonadotropin secretion and silence all downstream gonadal 
function in both sexes [9, 10, 11]. Thus, parenteral administration of a wide variety of GnRH 
analogues have been used in women and men to induce a biochemical castration over the past thirty-
five years with therapeutic indications including the treatment of precocious puberty, endometriosis, 
uterine fibroids, and prostate cancer [12].  As restoration of normal reproductive function in women 
promptly ensues following the discontinuation of  GnRHa administration, this biochemically-induced 
‘medical castration’ has provided a remarkably safe and reversible suppression of reproductive 
function in all of these medical conditions over the past three decades and now accounts for a several 
billion dollar annual pharmaceutical market. However, all of these indications require periodic 
injections since administration of a peptide is required.  
In comparison with sex steroids, all GnRHa are peptides, larger and more polar molecules. Systemic 
vaginal drug delivery of leuprolide, the prototypical GnRHa, has been possible in experimental studies 
in the rat as evidenced by their ability to stimulate luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle secreting 
hormone (FSH) levels following transvaginal administration [13]. However, current vaginal ring 
technologies are incapable of continuously releasing molecules over a few hundred molecular weight 
including peptides and proteins.  To our knowledge, transvaginal delivery of GnRHa, or for that matter 
any macromolecule, has never been shown in higher animals or humans.  
The present study was thus undertaken to design, develop, and test a novel transvaginal delivery 
polymer system that could release larger molecular weight substances such as a peptide in the form 
of a prototypical GnRHa, leuprolide (synthetic, man-made 9 amino acid sequence: p-Glu-His-Trp-Ser-
Tyr-D-Leu-Leu-Arg-Pro-NHEt) hormone that is similar to the natural hormone, GnRH, that is 
produced in the brain. Importantly, these tests were conducted in humans and measured both serum 
GnRHa levels and physiologic responses of gonadotropin and sex steroid responses. Leuprolide was 
selected as it is representative of the class of GnRHa; is approximately 40X more potent than the 
natural sequence GnRH; is commercially available; is much less polar that natural sequence GnRH; 
and is capable of inducing pituitary gonadotropin desensitization at far lower doses than the natural 
sequence GnRH.   
All of the five commercially available transvaginal rings designed to release small steroidal molecules 
(NuvaRing®, Femring®, Estring®, Fertiring®, and Progering®) utilize a rate controlling membrane.  
However, these particular constructs enable the controlled release of only low molecular weight 
molecules capable of passive diffusion through the outer membrane.  This particular design has the 
potential risk of ‘dumping,’ or rapid increases in serum levels of their contents, if a break in the ring 
and/or the membrane occurs, as there is not a matrix system underneath.  Consequently, in order to 
release a larger peptide such as leuprolide acetate via this route, a new intravaginal ring design 
without a membrane, i.e. a homogenous cross-section ring, was developed.  This vaginal ring system 
went through several critical design steps in order to create formulation parameters that achieved 
desired release kinetics for peptides. These included iterative optimization for the appropriate size, 
mechanical properties, and stiffness that provided desired release kinetics for a peptide alone or in 
combination with sex steroids. This included a careful selection of the appropriate mixture of medical 
grade ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) polymers and excipients to control for stiffness/rigidity of the ring, 
minimization of the knit-line formation, and to effectively control the release kinetics of the ring. 
Finally, a scaled-up manufacturing approach to create rings that could be approved for use in humans 
was developed.

Selection of polymers for the ring was limited to medical grade EVA (Evatane® by Arkema, France). 
This provides superior biocompatibility over silicone-based polymers and also exhibits good 
mechanical properties. Evatane is a random copolymer of Ethylene and Vinyl Acetate made by a 
high-pressure radical polymerization process1.  These specialty thermoplastic copolymers are 
inherently flexible, resilient, tough, and show excellent resistance to environmental stress cracking2. 
Although Evatane is available in various grades (varying ratio of ethylene to vinyl acetate), they all 
possess similar general properties. The following table (Table 1) demonstrates typical physical 
properties of three Evatane polymers that were used:3

EVA copolymer granules were cryogenically milled to reduce the EVA bead size to a fine powder.   
Initial attempts to use Evatane showed that the some of the lots had a high amount of vinyl acetate 
residues.  In order to reduce the level of monomeric vinyl acetate in EVA copolymer, the beads were 
washed with water.4 
150 g of Evatane 40-55 was weighed into a weighing pan. One liter of de-ionized water was placed in 
a 2-L beaker and stirred using an Arrow Engineering Mixer with a setting of 2.5. The polymer was 
charged into the beaker while mixing. The copolymeric beads were stirred in water for 20 minutes. 
After stirring, the material was filtered and collected. Evatane beads were washed nine times by 
repeating the washing and filtration cycle. Following the wash-filter cycle the washed-filtered beads 
were collected and further drained by passing the copolymeric material through a 1700-microns 
sieve. Finally, Evatane, along with the sieve, was placed in a vacuum oven for 48-72 hours.5

The presence of residual (unreacted) monomeric vinyl acetate present in EVA beads was determined 
using head-space gas chromatography (HS-GC). The remaining vinyl acetate monomer of the raw 
and the washed EVA beads were determined to be 1458 ppm and 0.9 ppm, respectively.5   
The intravaginal leuprolide acetate rings were prepared from the washed polymer (EVA).  18 mg, 36 
mg, or 54 mg leuprolide acetate was dissolved or dispersed in approximately 10 mL of ethanol in 
scintillation vials, followed by the addition of 1400 mg of Evatane to the ethanolic solution while 
mixing using a rotary shaker. The resulting mixtures were solvent-casted in dry ice using ethanol as 
the solvent (Pharmco; Cat. No. 111 USP 200 CSGL; Lot No. M8241). The solvent was allowed to 
evaporate overnight, and the dry EVA/drug mixtures were then ground into powders.6 
The milled EVA polymers were combined with the initial blend or granulation of leuprolide acetate 
(PolyPeptide Laboratories Inc.), PEG4000 (Union Carbide Corp / Dow Chemical Co.), and 
Polysorbate 80 (Uniqema / Croda PLC) to produce leuprolide acetate/EVA granulation that was fed to 
the extruder, after which the extrudate was pelletized and rings were formed by injection molding.  
The resulting rings were individually wrapped in moisture- and light- protective packaging to protect 
the GnRHa peptide.   
The EVA/drug powders were placed in an injection molding unit (DSM, Geleen, Holland). The injector 
was heated to approximately 80° C. The molten EVA/drug compositions were extruded into stainless 
steel mold at 10˚ C, creating a ring with an outer diameter of 50 mm and a cross section of 4 mm.7  
The formed intravaginal EVA rings were tested for their properties (Physical Appearance, 
Identification, Potency, Related Substances / Impurities, Leuprolide Acetate Release Rate, see Table 
2) and supplied to the clinic.

Further optimization of the ring manufacturing process took place while clinical trials were being 
conducted.  The goal was to create a scalable process that will form intravaginal rings that meet the 
performance criteria as it was set out above.   
A typical process was conducted as follows: 
A 750 gram batch of leuprolide acetate extruded pellets, 2.4% w/w, was manufactured using the 
components described in Table 3 below8:

*The listed components were dispensed according to the mass listed in the far right column. 7.575 
grams of Polysorbate 80, National Formulary (USP-NF) (NF) was dispensed into a 60mL syringe. A 
1% excess of the Polysorbate 80, NF over the theoretical amount of 7.5 grams was dispensed to 
allow for residual losses in the syringe. 
PRIMARY MIXING: 
30 grams of polyethylene glycol, NF was placed in the bowl of a GMX-Lab Micro High Shear Mixing 
System with a 1 liter bowl and 1 liter blades. The GMX-Lab Micro was closed with the chopper set to 
OFF. The polyethylene glycol, NF was then mixed with a plow speed of 155 RPM for approximately 
30 seconds. 18 grams of the leuprolide acetate was then added into the 1 liter bowl of the GMX-Lab 
Micro. The remaining 30 grams of the polyethylene glycol, NF was used to rinse the liner from the 
leuprolide acetate into the 1 liter bowl of the GMX-Lab Micro. The GMX-Lab Micro was then closed 
with the chopper set to OFF and the Polysorbate 80, NF was slowly charged from the syringe into the 
GMX-Lab Micro bowl while mixing with a plow speed of 155 RPM. The combination was mixed for 
approximately 3 minutes. 
SECONDARY MIXING: 
332.25 grams of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, milled (Evatane EVA 18-150, milled) was then 
added into the bowl of a GMX-Lab Micro High Shear Mixing System with a 4 liter bowl and 4 liter 
blades (1st Layer). The polyethylene glycol, NF, leuprolide acetate, and Polysorbate 80, NF mixture 
was then collected from the GMX-Lab Micro 1 liter bowl and transferred to the 4 liter bowl of the 
GMX-Lab Micro (2nd Layer). 332.25 grams of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, milled (Evatane EVA 
28-40, milled) was then added into the 4 liter bowl of the GMX-Lab Micro (3rd Layer). The GMX-Lab 
Micro was closed and the combination was mixed for approximately 5 minutes at 425 rpm with the 
chopper set to ON, low speed range. The blend was then transferred into a container double lined 
with poly bags with 2 desiccant, 4 unit silica gel between the inner and outer liner. 
HOT MELT EXTRUSION PROCEDURE: 
A Leistritz ZSE 18 HP Extruder System with a 25:1 extruder barrel was arranged with the following 
barrel configuration: Open Barrel (Feed); Closed Barrel; Closed Barrel; Open Barrel (Vent); Closed 
Barrel; Final Melt Plate. The 25:1 length/diameter ratio twin screws were assembled as shown in 
Figure 2 and installed into the extruder. A 3.0 mm single bore round die and spacer was installed onto 
the final melt plate. Supply and return connections were made between a Tempered Water Generator

(TWG) and the extruder. In particular, tempered water lines were connected to the extrusion barrel 
manifold, one set of cooling water lines was connected to the feeding barrel, one set of cooling lines 
was connected to the gear box, and all supply and return valves were placed in the open position.

The TWG and pump were turned on, the chilled water set point was adjusted to 13.0° C, and the 
tempered water set point was adjusted to 30.0° C.  A K-Tron KCL24T20 Feeder w/ 12 mm diameter 
20 pitch screws was connected to, and positioned behind the extruder. The K-Tron was bonded / 
grounded to the extruder and the impeller inside of the feeder hopper was installed so as not to touch 
the wall of the hopper. The extruder was turned on and the temperature set points for each heating

A 30-minute wait time was observed to allow the extruder to reach thermal equilibrium. The K-Tron 
feeding method was set to normal and the K-Tron feeder hopper was filled with the blend from the 
GMX-Lab Micro described above. The feed rate was set to 0.75 kg/hr and the K- Tron was run until 
the material began to flow to prime the feed screws. The K-Tron's auto calibration routine was then 
executed and the K-Tron was aligned with the extruder feed opening. The K-Tron feeder was set to 
Gravimetric Dosing mode and the feed rate set point for the extruder was set at 100% for feeder 1 
and 0.0% for feeder 2. A Dorner Cooling Conveyer was aligned with the extruder die with cooling fan 
1 OFF and fans 2, 3, and 4 ON.  
The feed opening of a Scheer Bay BT-25 Pelletizer was aligned at the end of the cooling conveyor. A 
container double lined with poly bags with 2 desiccant, 4 unit silica gel between the inner and outer 
liner was placed beneath the pelletizer discharge chute to collect the pelletized material. 
The screw drive was started at a rate of 10.0 rpm and the screws were allowed to turn a few 
revolutions to ensure proper installation. The screw speed was then increased to 50 rpm (+ 10 rpm) 
and feeder 1 was started at 100% of the feed rate total for an effective feed rate of 0.75 kg/hr (+ 0.2) 
kg/hr. The cooling conveyer was bypassed and the extruder was run into a waste container for 5 
minutes, or until the extrudate was translucent with no dark spots. The conveyer and pelletizer 
speeds were adjusted to draw the extrudate in such a way as to produce pellets approximately 5 mm 
or smaller. The product funnel on the extruder was monitored to ensure buildup of material did not 
occur. If excessive build-up was observed, excess material was vacuumed from the product funnel 
area. During the batch, the heated zone set points were adjusted within the ranges noted in Table 4 
above to maintain the target temperature. 
The extrudate was visually examined to verify that the extrudate was translucent with no dark spots. If 
extrudate appearance became opaque or output decreased, the melt plate was heated to 80°C to 
90°C using a torch. The K-Tron feeder hopper was refilled as necessary and set to the Gravimetric 
Dosing mode after each re-fill. The pelletized extrudate was added into an 8 quart V-Shell blender 
and blended for 5 minutes (± 1 minute). The blended extrudate was then transferred into a container 
double lined with poly bags with 2 desiccant, 4 unit silica gel between the inner and outer liners. 
INJECTION MOLDING PROCEDURE 
The pelletized and blended extrudate was then transferred to the hopper of a Sesame Nano-Molder 
Injection Molding Machine configured with the mold plates of Figure 3, which defined a mold cavity 
with a 4 mm minor ring diameter and a 54 mm major ring diameter. A ring-shaped drug delivery 
device was injection molded using a 2.0 mm circular nozzle, a molding pressure of 1550 bar, a speed 
setting of 100 mm per second, a mold temperature of 55° C, and a barrel temperature of 85° C. The 
finished drug delivery device was then allowed to cool and removed from the mold.

To determine the ring’s mechanical performance, a model was developed which mimics the 
intravaginal mechanical forces that a TVDS may typically experience due to increased intra-
abdominal pressure (e.g. coughing, running, or defecating) [15]. This method measures the ring 
compressibility (elastic modulus) by determining the mechanical force required to reach a fixed 
distance at four compression points: 10, 20, 30 and 33 mm. NuvaRing® was used as a standard 
comparator due to its high level of patient acceptability [16]. A summary of the different formulations, 
including the different EVA weights and excipients that were tested for their mechanical properties is 
shown in Tables 5 and 6.

Higher molecular weight blends of EVA (e.g. Batch A) provided higher ring rigidity similar to the 
rigidity of NuvaRing®.  It was found that a composition of EVA Copolymer with 28% vinyl acetate (VA) 
content, (Evatane® 28-40) blended with EVA Copolymer with 18% VA content (Evatane® 18-150) 
provided the optimum mechanical properties balancing rigidity and flexibility.  
The ring had an acceptable compression force that supported easy insertion by the woman, yet once 
in place allowed it to re-expand to its original round shape and resist the mechanical stress inside the 
vaginal cavity, thus increasing the intravaginal retention of the rings. The addition of vaginally-
accepted excipients [14] allowed us to modify the release kinetics iteratively while acting as 
plasticizers to reduce the mechanical stiffness of the neat polymers to an acceptable compression 
force. 
Subjects   
This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Partners Healthcare 
system and conducted at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.  Written informed consent was obtained 
and documented in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Healthy normal volunteers were 
recruited to participate in a three-day outpatient study beginning between days 1-7 of their menstrual 
cycle (i.e., the early follicular phase), during which there is a nadir of their endogenous sex steroid 
hormone levels.  A negative urinary human gonadotropin test was obtained prior to study initiation to 
assure their non-gravid state. Twenty-two female subjects aged 18-40 years were screened for the 
study; ten screen-failed and the remainder were lost to follow-up. Reasons for screen failure included 
laboratory abnormalities, such as mildly elevated baseline LFTs and prolactin levels, increased BMI, 
and irregular menstruation. Six subjects were lost to follow up before their baseline visit, and six 
subjects participated. The demographics of the six participants are included in Table 7.

Trial Design  
On the first study day, four baseline blood samples of 5 mL were drawn at 20-minute intervals over an 
hour (Time = 0, +20, +40, +60) and pooled to determine pretreatment levels of leuprolide, 
gonadotropins, and sex steroids. The vaginal rings were then inserted on the morning of Day 1. The 
first cohort of three women received vaginal rings containing 18 mg of leuprolide acetate, and the 
second cohort of three subjects received 36 mg.  Subsequent labs were drawn at noon and 4-5 pm 
on Day 1, and at 8-9 am, noon, and 4-5 pm on the two following days. The rings were withdrawn on 
Day 3. Serum levels of leuprolide, LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone were determined on all 
samples.   
Safety and Tolerability  
A visual examination of the vaginal epithelium was conducted at baseline and daily thereafter and 
findings recorded in a standard manner. A colposcopy was conducted at baseline before ring 
insertion and on Day 3 after ring removal to ensure no changes (e.g. evidence of inflammation) in the 
vaginal epithelium occurred.  
Assay Methodologies   
All reproductive hormone levels were determined by the Reproductive Endocrine Unit Reference 
Core Assay Laboratory of the Massachusetts General Hospital, which is both a GLP-compliant and 
CLIA-certified site. All serum samples were coded and blinded by the clinical research team prior to 
submission to the laboratory. The hormone levels from the experimental subjects were compared to 
normative data from 120 normal ovulatory menstrual cycles in which daily levels of gonadotropins and 
sex steroids were determined [19].  
 
Serum leuprolide levels were measured by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) method using a commercial kit (Catalog # S-1144, Peninsula Laboratories, LLC). This 
immuno-assay is widely used for pharmacokinetic research studies of leuprolide, but it does not 
distinguish between intact leuprolide and its breakdown fragments. Results therefore represent a 
combination of intact and metabolic products and thus serve as a composite index of the changes in 
relative drug concentrations.  All specimens from each participant’s study were tested in the same 
assay whose minimum detectable concentration was <50 pg/ml with a reportable range of 50-2,000 
pg/ml. Seven of the total of 53 specimens from all study subjects contained <50 pg/ml, i.e. the limit of 
assay sensitivity. These seven samples were constituted of mostly baseline and early sampling 
determinations from the low dose group.

Controlling Release Kinetics  
The in vitro release of leuprolide over time was determined in pH4 buffer media. This is 
representative of the local pH of a normal healthy vagina, and is also a pH that is typically employed 
to measure the in vitro drug release characteristics from intra-vaginal rings. The pKa of leuprolide 
acetate is reported as 9.6.10 Leuprolide acetate has three ionizable sites: the imidazaloyl nitrogen of 
histadine (pKa=6), the phenolic hydroxyl of tyrosine (pKa=10), and the guanidine nitrogen of arginine

(pKa=13). The resultant pKa value is attributed to both the tyrosine moiety and the extremely basic 
guanidine nitrogen. In consequence, leuprolide is predominantly ionized over the pH range that is of 
physiological relevance, so these test conditions were considered to be appropriate. Similarly, in vivo, 
we could also expect only minor differences in vaginal absorption of the drug to occur within the 
known pH variations that exist between different ethnicities and population age groups and also in 
women with lowered vaginal lactobacillus levels where the pH also increases towards neutrality.  
We previously demonstrated that the drug particle size affects the release kinetics from a 
homogenous matrix with larger particles increasing the contact area between adjacent particles to 
create a less tortuous path resulting in faster release kinetics [17, 18]. Thus, incorporating drugs with 
different drug particle sizes and loading could be used to adjust the desired release kinetics.  Batches 
B and C had the same formulations (Table 5), but Batch C was processed at a lower extruding rate 
(0.1 vs 0.5 Kg/h). The extruding rate did not affect the mechanical properties of the formed rings. 
Similarly, adding various excipients to the EVA mixture did not noticeably affect the mechanical 
properties of the rings. However, Batch A was made with EVA that had a lower melt flow index (i.e. 
higher MW), and as a result the mechanical properties of Batch A in comparison to Batches B and C 
(Table 5) displayed ca. 50% higher compression force of 400 g at 33mm (Figure 4).

To enable the release of larger molecular weight molecules such as leuprolide acetate, which require 
low drug loading, excipients needed to be added to allow continuous zero order kinetic drug release 
to be achieved. This pattern of drug release was one of our goals in designing this system. These 
excipients could be porosigens, i.e. excipients added to the drug to create the physical contact 
between the different particles that allow the drug to continue to be released from the matrix. As the 
excipients diffuse out of the ring matrix, the porosigens create tortuous paths for diffusion of the 
entrapped drugs should the drug particles be too small and not in contact with each other. 
Alternatively, some excipients can act as plasticizers that affect the diffusion of the drug through the 
EVA matrix for drugs that are soluble in this matrix, such as estradiol. The effect of different 
plasticizing excipients (such as polysorbate or polyethylene glycols) on the release kinetics is 
presented in Figure 5.

Formulation 1 includes only estradiol with no excipients, while Formulation 2 has additional 
plasticizers that accelerate the release kinetics by improving the diffusion of the estradiol through the 
EVA.  Considering all these variables, we investigated different formulations that would allow us to 
create an intravaginal ring containing leuprolide acetate (Table 6).  
The preparation of the rings in Figure 6 employed similar conditions. However, formulation NF1, with 
less vinyl acetate (without EVA 28-40), provided prolonged release with slower drug release rates.

Ultimately, EVA rings were loaded with either 18 mg of leuprolide acetate, which was anticipated to 
release ~50ug/day, or 36mg which was estimated to release ~100ug/day. These levels were 
calculated to be sufficiently high to induce a relatively complete desensitization of pituitary 
gonadotropin secretion and consequent ovarian quiescence given good vaginal absorption.  
  
Human Studies  
Six women met the eligibility criteria that included: normal healthy females aged 18-40, a BMI 
between 19-29, normal prolactin levels and a negative pregnancy test at the time of enrollment. Their 
average age was 26 years (range 18-40 years) and no leuprolide was detected in their baseline 
bloods.  There were nine patients screened who did not meet exclusion criteria and the reasons were 
as follows: abnormal laboratory results, Body Mass Indexes (BMIs) greater than allowed in the study, 
and irregular menses. Following insertion of the GnRHa rings, serum leuprolide concentrations rose 
in all six females to a mean of 310 pg/ml in the low dose and 1,220 pg/ml in the high dose group that 
peaked on Day 1. Figure 7 demonstrates these results graphically along with known published data 
on expected serum levels of leuprolide parenteral depot injection.

Mean serum leuprolide levels rose from 100 pg/mL levels to a peaks of 310 pg/ml in the 18 mg dose 
group and from 90 pg/mL to a peak of 1,220 ng/ml in the 36 mg group within 8 hours of vaginal ring 
insertion and remained elevated compared to baseline over the full three day course of study in the 
36 mg group. By Day 3, mean leuprolide levels remained detectable with a mean of 160 pg/ml in the 
18 mg group and 310pg/ml in the 36mg group.    
Parallel increases of serum FSH (Figure 8a), LH (Figure 8b), and estradiol (Figure 8c) occurred, 
confirming the biological activity of the leuprolide detected by ELISA.  Serum FSH levels peaked at 
11.2 mIU/ml in the 18 mg group and 24.4 mIU/ml in the high dose group. Similarly, LH levels peaked 
at 20.8 mIU/ml in the low dose group and at 46.2 mIU/ml in the high dose group relative to mean of 
the normative early follicular phase values of anticipated for this stage of the menstrual cycle (5.4 
mIU/mL).  These elevations of LH and FSH levels were rapid, with the most dramatic increase 
observed eight hours post ring insertion for both gonadotropins. Compared to the daily normative 
data from 120 normal female early follicular phases indicating an average FSH (7.3 mIU/mL), these 
FSH levels were also clearly elevated in the study subjects. Although the sample size was small, all 
subjects in the high dose group exhibited peak serum levels of LH and FSH greater than one 
standard deviation outside of the maximal reference value.  Two of the three subjects in the low dose 
group also demonstrated peak LH and FSH levels greater than one standard deviation outside of this 
reference range.

Consistent with the biologic activity representative of the leuprolide entering the circulation, elevated 
estradiol and progesterone levels occurred, lagging behind the gonadotropin secretion in a typical 
fashion. While FSH and LH secretion peaked on Day 1, subsequent increases in estradiol were 
observed on Day 2 with the time to peak estradiol concentrations varying between subjects. The low 
dose group peaked at 122pg/ml (56-239pg/mL), whereas the high dose peaked at 138 pg/ml (88-
208pg/mL) relative to the normative early follicular phase values anticipated of 61pg/ml.  One subject 
in the low dose group had a dramatic increase in her serum progesterone, suggesting some residual 
functioning of her corpus luteum from the previous cycle that is often seen during GnRHa 
administration during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. However, serum progesterone 
levels in all the remaining subjects demonstrated only mild increases in progesterone secretion in 
both low and high dose GnRHa groups.   
 
One subject in the high dose GnRHa group had peak levels of serum leuprolide of 2,000 pg/mL. This 
same subject also demonstrated the most dramatic increases in peak FSH (37 mIU/ml) and peak LH 
(60.6 mIU/ml). By three days post GnRHa administration, elevation in her serum concentrations of 
leuprolide (430 pg/mL), FSH (8.3mIU/mL), and LH (10.2 mIU/mL) persisted. This elevated serum LH 
remained >1SD above the maximal reference value at three days post insertion.

2 and 3, the ring dislodged overnight between Day 1 and Day 2 associated with Valsalva maneuvers 
but was easily replaced by the subjects themselves and validated as to their location by the primary 
investigator on Day 2.  The rings that were tested in this study were designed primarily for their drug 
elution and delivery properties. They were not optimized for their 'fit and feel' and patient comfort. As 
a result the rings were, at times, ejected from the vagina when a few individuals exhibited any internal 
pressure, through defecating, coughing etc.  Interestingly, these temporary dislocations did not 
appear to affect absorption of leuprolide significantly in subject 2 but may have in subject 3.  
Discussion:  
This study demonstrates that effective, non-parenteral absorption of a polar peptide of considerably 
larger size than sex steroids could be achieved via delivery from a novel vaginal ring delivery system 
with resulting therapeutic serum levels of GnRHa. The agonist biological activity of the circulating 
GnRHa was confirmed by subsequent elevations of serum LH and FSH and ovarian sex steroid 
secretion. To provide some context for these results, a single intramuscular injection of the three 
month Leuprolide® Depot injection containing 11.25 mg produces a mean plasma leuprolide 
concentration 36.3ng/mL four hours post intramuscular injection. After reaching steady state by 
weeks 3-12, however, mean circulating leuprolide concentrations subsequently plateau to levels of 
230 =/- 90 pg/ml (SS) at 12 weeks, i.e. levels sufficient to maintain the desired therapeutic 
suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis for 3 months with these levels. Although the present study 
was limited to a 56 hour period per FDA requirements, the resulting serum levels of leuprolide 
achieved in both the low and high dose groups achieved this target range within hours of vaginal 
application of our ring.  
 
Vaginal rings are well established to deliver relatively physiological levels of natural estradiol and 
progesterone systemically for hormone replacement treatment in menopausal women, as well as 
pharmacologic levels of synthetic steroids for contraception in reproductively active women, to 
circumvent the known hepatic first pass phenomenon of synthetic sex steroids that occurs when 
administered orally. The current studies now demonstrate the potential feasibility of developing a 
vaginal ring drug delivery system that could extend the therapeutic window of transvaginal delivery to 
combine the established systemic delivery of sex steroids with that of a larger peptide such as a 
GnRHa.  Such a combined ‘GnRHa + sex steroid’ TVDS ring could potentially be used to administer 
GnRHa to induce a complete quiescence of the pituitary-ovarian axis that would completely block 
ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis but also permit coincidental administration of physiologic 
levels of natural estradiol and progesterone (i.e. ‘add back’ regimens). The advantage of this 
combination would be to maintain physiologic levels of sex steroid to support responsive target 
organs of bone, vaginal epithelium, and abolish the CNS effects of GnRHa-induced biochemical 
castration with hot flashes. 
Such combination rings containing GnRHa + natural sex steroids would be useful in two clinical 
settings. In women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), one therapeutic goal is to suppress 
ovarian androgen secretion that drives their hirsutism and potentially contributes to their insulin 
resistance while avoiding the castrational side effects of GnRHa administration alone [20]. In addition, 
it would also be possible to add insulin-sensitizing agents to these rings to treat their insulin 
resistance in theory. Similarly, GnRHa’s ability to completely suppress gonadotropins and hence 
ovulation to provide contraception has traditionally been limited by the side effect of leaving women 
with hot flashes, decreased bone density, and vaginal atrophy. Combining physiologic ‘add-back’ of 
natural sex steroids with GnRHa administration would thus open the possibility of using such a 
combined vaginal ring in a contraceptive mode.  
In addition, a current standard therapy for women with endometriosis is to combine intramuscular 
leuprolide injections with oral norethindrone acetate to control the castrational symptoms that typically 
accompany isolated GnRHa therapy. However, oral norethindrone acetate is subject to both first

hepatic first pass metabolism and the vagaries of patient compliance. A transvaginal drug delivery 
system that could co-administer controlled release of a GnRHa and simultaneously add back sex 
steroid hormones would thus open a considerably wider range of more convenient methods of drug 
delivery in several important clinical settings. It could also support the co-administration of other 
medications such as anti-HIV treatments that have been shown to reduce infectivity when 
administered transvaginally but which often become limited by compliance [21].  
Several limitations of this study exist. The number of subjects and duration relate to FDA imposed 
IND restrictions.  Also the population size was too small to detect statistically significant differences 
between the low and high dose groups; however, the trends are consistent with a dose-response 
relationship between ring leuprolide concentrations in addition to their physiologic effects. The low 
dose ring was inserted immediately at the end of subject 1’s menses as opposed to subjects 2 and 3 
in whom the ring was inserted at the beginning of their menses. Insertion of the ring at the end of their 
menses, i.e. in the middle of the follicular phase, likely explains the more exuberant rise in estradiol 
seen in subject 1.   
Future research should examine longer time courses in larger numbers of subjects to induce 
complete reproductive quiescence investigate and titrating GnRHa dosing to achieve target serum 
concentrations. Longer-term studies will also help to determine the stability of hormone release 
which, according to our in vitro studies, follow near zero order kinetics and are stable for weeks.  The 
results of this study suggest that the use of a vaginal ring for controlled and constant delivery of a 
large peptide, such as GnRH agonists, is not only feasible but represents a potentially novel 
therapeutic platform that will enable several potentially interesting treatments or combinations of 
treatments in a variety of clinical settings. Currently, there are other FDA-approved combinations of a 
contraceptive vaginal ring containing two synthetic steroids, etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol 
(NuvaRing®). Although delivery of proteins has been previously demonstrated from vaginal rings, 
such studies have employed IVR’s of more complex designs which comprise a ring body into which a 
drug-loaded inserts is placed [22]. Our study utilizes a simple matrix design IVR without incorporating 
a rate controlling membrane.  The biological and therapeutic implications of this study extend beyond 
the clinical applications of leuprolide, and this study opens the door for broader investigations into the 
transvaginal delivery of peptides and proteins. Future research will determine what other larger 
molecules can be absorbed transvaginally in addition to refining the dosing and formulations of our 
current delivery systems.
