Association Between Long-term
Exposure to Air Pollution and
Biomarkers Related to Insulin
Resistance, Subclinical Inflammation,
and Adipokines
Diabetes 2016;65:3314–3326 | DOI: 10.2337/db15-1567
Insulin resistance (IR) is present long before the onset of
type 2 diabetes and results not only from inherited and
lifestyle factors but also likely from environmental con-
ditions. We investigated the association between mod-
eled long-term exposure to air pollution at residence
and biomarkers related to IR, subclinical inflammation,
and adipokines. Data were based on 2,944 participants
of the KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region
Augsburg) F4 study conducted in southern Germany
(2006–2008). We analyzed associations between individ-
ual air pollution concentration estimated by land use
regression and HOMA-IR, glucose, insulin, HbA1c, leptin,
and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels from
fasting samples using multivariable linear regression
models. Effect estimates were calculated for the
whole study population and subgroups of individuals
who did not have diabetes, had prediabetes, or had
diabetes. Among all participants, a 7.9 mg/m3 increment
in particulate matter of <10 mm was associated with
higher HOMA-IR (15.6% [95% CI 4.0; 28.6]) and insulin
(14.5% [3.6; 26.5]). Nitrogen dioxide was associated with
HOMA-IR, glucose, insulin, and leptin. Effect estimates
for individuals with prediabetes were much larger and
highly statistically significant, whereas individuals who
did not have diabetes or had diabetes showed rather
weak associations. No association was seen for HbA1c
level. Our results suggested an association between
long-term exposure to air pollution and IR in the general
population that was attributable mainly to individuals with
prediabetes.
Insulin resistance (IR) is a condition that is characterized
by decreased tissue sensitivity to the action of insulin.
After an initial compensatory stage when increased insu-
lin secretion compensates for the low insulin action, the
following stage indicates rapidly rising glucose levels. At
this stage, IR can be diagnosed as isolated impaired
fasting glucose (i-IFG), isolated impaired glucose tolerance
(i-IGT), or both IFG and IGT. IR has been shown to be
associated with a high risk of the development of type 2
diabetes in later life (1,2) and is considered to be an in-
dependent predictor for type 2 diabetes and therefore is

METABOLISM
 often referred to as a prediabetic state (3–5). However,
diabetes will not develop in all insulin-resistant people.
In 2013, the International Diabetes Federation esti-
mated a diabetes prevalence of ;8.3% (382 million peo-
ple) worldwide, with type 2 diabetes accounting for
;85–95% of all cases of diabetes (6). Obesity (7,8) and
certain gene variants (9) were associated with diabetes
and may cause the disease. Further critical factors deter-
mining the susceptibility for diabetes may be poor nutri-
tion and sedentary lifestyle (10). In recent years, air
pollution has also been discussed as a potential risk factor
for the onset of type 2 diabetes (11–15). Several reviews
and a meta-analysis combined the epidemiological find-
ings and quantified the risk increases for type 2 diabetes
per 10 mg/m3 increase in exposure between 5% and 27%
for particulate matter (PM) #2.5mm in diameter (PM2.5),
1–15% for PM #10mm in diameter (PM10), and 1–11%
for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (14,16–20), depending on the
studies included. Still, the underlying mechanisms are
not fully understood, although a number of plausible
pathways have been suggested, including systemic in-
flammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal mechanisms
(12,14,15,21). Recent studies (10,22–27) investigating
air pollution and IR as a precursor state of type 2 diabetes
showed positive associations. However, these studies were
experimental, investigated short-term effects, or were fo-
cused on children.
With this cross-sectional analysis, we aimed to assess
the associations between long-term exposure to air pol-
lution at residence and biomarkers related to IR, sub-
clinical inflammation, and adipokines 1) in the general
population and 2) in individuals without diabetes, those
with prediabetes, and individuals with diabetes. For
all markers investigated, we hypothesized incremented
levels in association with incremented air pollutant
concentrations. We evaluated HOMA-IR, fasting glu-
cose, fasting insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, as
well as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)
levels as established markers of inflammation. In addi-
tion, leptin was examined as adipokine, which has been
suggested to be associated with IR (28). In terms of
environmental stressors, we evaluated modeled long-
term exposures to PM (PM10, PM between 2.5 and
10 mm in diameter [PMcoarse], PM2.5, and PM2.5 absor-
bance), and nitrogen oxides based on measurements con-
ducted in 2008/2009 as well as two traffic indicators.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Population
The current analysis is based on data collected within the
Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg
(KORA) F4 study conducted in the city of Augsburg and
two adjacent rural counties (southern Germany) during 2006–
2008.
Altogether, 3,080 participants of the KORA F4 study
were invited to the study center in Augsburg, where
they answered a computer-assisted personal interview
and completed a self-administered questionnaire. All
individuals were physically examined, and fasting blood
samples were taken. Individuals without diabetes un-
derwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (29).
In the KORA F4 study, data on glucose metabolism
were gathered as follows: previously diagnosed diabetes
was defined as a validated physician diagnosis or current
use of glucose-lowering agents; and newly diagnosed dia-
betes, i-IGT, i-IFG, and normal glucose tolerance were
defined according to World Health Organization (WHO)
1999 diagnostic criteria (30) based on fasting and post-
OGTT values. For definition, diagnosis, and classification
of glucose metabolism, see Supplementary Table 1.
Because of missing address information (n = 20), miss-
ing information on glucose metabolism (n = 94), the non-
fasting status of some individuals (n = 10), or missing
information on the main confounders (n = 12), 136 par-
ticipants had to be excluded. For subgroup analysis, we
stratified the remaining number of 2,944 study partici-
pants into the following subgroups: 1) people having no
diabetes (nondiabetes group n = 2,125) with normal glu-
cose tolerance; 2) people representing a group without
diabetes with conditions that are associated with IR (pre-
diabetes group n = 496) with i-IFG, i-IGT, or IFG and IGT;
and 3) people who already have type 2 diabetes (diabetes
group n = 323). Although diabetes will not develop in all
individuals in whom IR has been diagnosed, for reasons of
brevity and simplicity we named all individuals with di-
agnosable IR as the prediabetes group. More details on
study design, sampling method, and data collection are
provided elsewhere (31).
Outcome Definition
Blood was collected with minimal stasis, refrigerated at
4–8°C, and shipped in refrigerant packaging within 2–4 h
to the laboratory of Augsburg Central Hospital. Fasting
venous blood glucose was sampled in the morning (7:00 A.M.
to 11:00 A.M.). All participants without diabetes were given a
75-g dose of anhydrous glucose (Dextro OGT; Boehringer
Mannheim, Ingelheim, Germany), and another blood sam-
ple was collected after 2 h. Serum glucose was measured
using a hexokinase method (GLU Flex; Dade Behring Mar-
burg, Marburg, Germany). Insulin was determined using
ELISA kits from Invitrogen (Camarillo, CA). As a surrogate
of IR, the homeostatic model assessment was used and de-
fined as HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin [mU/mL]) 3 (fasting
glucose [mmol/L])/22.5 (32).
HbA1c was measured with a reverse-phase, cation-
exchange, high-performance liquid chromotography method
(analyzer HA 8160; Menarini Group). Leptin concentra-
tions were assessed using ELISA kits from Mercodia
(Uppsala, Sweden). The measurement of hs-CRP was in
anticoagulated plasma samples using a high-sensitivity
latex-enhanced nephelometric assay on a BN II analyzer
(Dade Behring), with intra-assay and interassay coeffi-
cients of variation of 2.7% and 6.3%, respectively.

 Air Pollution Exposure
Residential exposure to ambient air pollution assessed as
mean annual levels was estimated within the ESCAPE
study (European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects
[www.escapeproject.eu]). Air pollution measurements of
PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and the sum of NO2 and nitrogen
monoxides (NOx) were collected at 20 (PM) and 40
(NOx) monitoring sites for three periods of 2 weeks in
the cold, warm, and one intermediate season during the
period from October 2008 to July 2009. Land use re-
gression (LUR) models were developed on the basis of
annual average measurements and predictor variables
like traffic, land use, industry, and population density
derived from geographic information systems (33,34).
These regression models were then applied to the resi-
dence addresses of study participants to assess individ-
ual long-term concentrations.
In addition to the modeled air pollution concentration,
we considered two traffic indicators: 1) traffic intensity on
the nearest road (number of vehicles/day) and 2) traffic
load on major roads within 100 m of the residence (num-
ber of vehicles*meter/day), defined as the sum of traffic
intensity on roads with .5,000 vehicles/day multiplied
by the length of those roads in a 100 m buffer around the
home addresses.
Covariates
As potential confounding factors might affect the different
outcomes in different ways, we hierarchically optimized
our confounder models for each outcome separately. First,
we specified a minimum set of a priori defined covariates
for all outcome variables, including age, sex, smoking
status, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (Spearman correlation
coefficient with BMI was 0.52), and month of blood
withdrawal. Second, we selected from several socioeco-
nomic variables, as follows: occupational status, years of
education, per capita income, and socioeconomic status
(categorical variable combining education and income). In
a third step, we offered further lifestyle-related variables:
years and pack-years of smoking, physical activity, and
alcohol intake. The selection in steps 2 and 3 was based
on minimizing the Bayesian information criterion as it
deals with the trade-off between the goodness-of-fit and
the complexity of the model. For a detailed description
of the covariates and the final confounder models, see
Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2.
Statistical Analyses
We performed Pearson x2 tests for categorical variables
and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables to test
for differences between the subgroups. Correlations be-
tween air pollutants and residential proximity to traffic
were examined using Spearman correlation coefficients.
To assess the association between long-term resi-
dential exposure to air pollution and the biomarkers,
we performed multivariable linear regression analyses.
All outcomes were log transformed since residuals deviated
from normality. We included the annual mean concentration
of each air pollutant separately as a linear term in addition
to the chosen covariates. Traffic variables were additionally
adjusted for background NO2 levels to investigate traffic
effects independent of the background air pollution concen-
trations. To investigate potential effect modification by sex,
we included an interaction term in the model. Results are
presented as the percentage change of the geometric mean
value per 5th 2 95th percentile difference of the exposure
concentrations and corresponding 95% CIs. Effect estimates
were calculated separately for all participants, and for the
nondiabetes, prediabetes, and diabetes subgroups. Tests
of interaction were calculated for differences between
subgroups (35).
As a sensitivity analysis, we applied a very basic con-
founder model including only sex, age, and BMI to verify
whether the level of covariate adjustment was proba-
bly too high to detect an association. We used additive
models incorporating separately each exposure variable
as a cubic regression spline with 3 df to check the linearity
of the dose-response function. In addition, we categorized
the exposure variables into quartiles and alternatively ran
quantile regression. Since an underlying systemic inflam-
mation due to an acute infection might change markers
of IR, we excluded study participants with an hs-CRP
value .10 mg/L. To investigate the influence of glucose-
and lipid-lowering medication, we excluded persons tak-
ing antidiabetic medications or statins. We also excluded
persons who reported an intake of diuretics and/or
b-blockers, as this type of medication may promote sus-
ceptibility for IR (36,37). To assess the sensitivity of our
results to the influence of the degree of impaired glucose
regulation, we stratified the prediabetes group into i-IFG
(n = 113), i-IGT (n = 307), and IFG-IGT (n = 76) groups.
Moreover, we stratified the diabetes group into persons
with newly diagnosed diabetes (n = 113) and individuals
with known type 2 diabetes (n = 210).
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS version
9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R version 3.1.0 (The R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
Study Population
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 2,944
study participants. The mean age was 56.2 years, the
mean BMI was 27.6 kg/m2, and marginally more women
participated. Participants with prediabetes and participants
with diabetes, on average, were older, BMI was higher, and
more usually male than participants without diabetes. In
addition, they showed a lower prevalence of current smok-
ers, but a higher prevalence of ex-smokers. Also, socioeco-
nomic status and physical activity were in general lower
for individuals with prediabetes and individuals with di-
abetes. The prevalence of hypertension, myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, and medication intake were higher with
worsened insulin sensitivity.

 Plasma concentrations of the six selected biomarkers
are described in Table 2 by the arithmetic mean and SD as
well as the geometric mean. Significant differences were
found for all markers between study groups. All consid-
ered blood markers showed higher concentrations with
deteriorating glucose metabolism.
Long-term Air Pollution
The distribution of modeled annual average concentra-
tions of air pollutants and traffic indicators at partici-
pants’ residences can be found in Table 3. Air pollution
concentrations were below European Union limits (Euro-
pean Union Directive 2008/50/EC) but exceeded WHO
recommendations (38). Correlations between air pollution
and traffic indicators were only low to moderate. There
were no significant differences in the exposure levels be-
tween the three subgroups (Supplementary Table 3).
Association Between Long-term Air Pollution and
Biomarkers Related to IR
Tables 4 and 5 show the associations between long-term
residential exposure to air pollutants, traffic indicators,
and biomarkers related to IR. Among all study partici-
pants, exposure to NO2 was significantly positively asso-
ciated with HOMA-IR, glucose, insulin, and leptin levels.
Also, PM10, PMcoarse, PM2.5 absorbance, and NOx showed
a positive association with HOMA-IR and insulin, whereas
PM2.5 was borderline significant for glucose. Both traffic
indicators were not significantly associated with any of
the blood markers.
For individuals without diabetes, exposure to NOx was
associated with HOMA-IR, glucose, and insulin, whereas
NO2 was associated with leptin. Among people with di-
abetes, the only significant association was seen between
traffic load on major roads within 100 m from the resi-
dence and glucose levels.
The group of individuals with prediabetes yielded the
strongest association with highest effect estimates. In
this group, HOMA-IR was associated with all air pollut-
ants except PM2.5 and traffic load on major roads within
100 m. With HOMA-IR being the product of fasting glu-
cose and insulin, regression results between air pollutants
and insulin mainly replicated the associations found for
HOMA-IR, whereas glucose was associated only with traf-
fic load on major roads. Further associations were seen for
leptin with all air pollutants (Table 5). Results in the pre-
diabetes subgroup may indicate some underlying systemic
inflammatory processes. Our effect estimates for hs-CRP
pointed in this direction because most air pollutants were
significantly associated with higher percentage changes in
hs-CRP in individuals with prediabetes (Table 5).
The investigation of sex as effect modifier did not reveal
any significant differences between men and women (data
not shown).
Sensitivity Analyses
The reduction of covariate adjustment led to similar
results (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We checked the

 linearity of the dose-response function by including the
air pollutants as cubic regression splines exemplarily for
HOMA-IR in the prediabetes group. All air pollutants in-
dicated no clear deviation from linearity when incorpo-
rated as a smooth function in the model (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Also, the categorical analyses comparing the quar-
tiles of exposure generally confirmed the linear trend ex-
cept for PMcoarse and PM2.5 in the prediabetes group, and
the diabetes group that showed no clear pattern, poten-
tially due to the reduced power (Supplementary Fig. 2).
The alternative quantile regression indicated no clear het-
erogeneity across the deciles (Supplementary Fig. 3A–D).
When excluding participants with hs-CRP .10 mg/L (n =
97), results were robust for all participants (data not
shown). In the prediabetes group, effect estimates were
slightly attenuated for HOMA-IR, insulin, and leptin. For
the latter, the association with PM10, PMcoarse, and PM2.5
was not significant anymore. For HOMA-IR, the PM2.5
estimate was slightly higher and significant for individuals
with prediabetes and individuals with diabetes (data not
shown).
The exclusion of 155 participants who reported an
intake of antidiabetic medication showed quite robust
estimates for all participants (Fig. 1, exemplarily shown
for NO2). Estimates for the diabetes group changed con-
siderably because the exclusion affected almost half of the
participants, resulting in lower estimates for glucose and
HbA1c levels, but higher estimates for HOMA-IR, insulin,
leptin, and hs-CRP levels. The exclusion of 352 partici-
pants taking statins slightly attenuated the estimates for
HOMA-IR, glucose, and insulin levels (Supplementary Fig.
4, exemplarily shown for NO2). Leptin and hs-CRP esti-
mates were generally robust but were higher for the di-
abetes group, resulting in significant estimates for NO2.
The exclusion of 762 study participants taking di-
uretics and/or b-blockers (with 306 who reported an in-
take of both) showed robust effect estimates for all
participants, but showed attenuated estimates for glucose
as well as for glucose and insulin in individuals without
diabetes. In the prediabetes group, effect estimates for
leptin and hs-CRP were not significant anymore (data not
shown). The stratification of the prediabetes subgroup into
individuals with i-IFG, i-IGT, or IFG-IGT showed in general
higher percentage changes for persons with i-IFG and i-IGT,
especially for HOMA-IR, insulin, and hs-CRP (Fig. 2, exem-
plarily shown for HOMA-IR). For leptin, only participants
with i-IGT showed an association (data not shown). The
stratification of the diabetes subgroup into participants
with newly diagnosed diabetes and individuals with known
type 2 diabetes for HOMA-IR showed significant associa-
tions for almost all exposures for the first strata but no
association for the second strata (Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
We examined the association between residential long-
term exposure to air pollutants and traffic indicators on
biomarkers related to IR, subclinical inflammation, and

 adipokines in a cross-sectional study conducted in the
region of Augsburg, in southern Germany. Among all study
participants, we found a positive association between PM10,
PMcoarse, PM2.5 absorbance, NOx, and NO2, and HOMA-IR
and insulin levels. Furthermore, NO2 was significantly asso-
ciated with glucose and leptin. When stratifying by glucose
tolerance, most pollutants were statistically significant in
association with HOMA-IR, insulin, leptin, and hs-CRP in
the prediabetes subgroup. Individuals with or without di-
abetes showed, rather, no or only weak associations between
air pollution and blood markers.
Sensitivity analyses suggested in general robust results
for all participants and for most of the subgroup analyses.
However, medication intake seemed to play a complex
role, especially for the diabetes subgroup. Thus, the exclu-
sion of participants taking glucose-lowering medication
(diabetes group only) led to higher air pollution estimates
for HOMA-IR, insulin, leptin, and hs-CRP levels, but lower
estimates for glucose and HbA1c levels. Estimates in this
group were also higher for leptin and hs-CRP levels when
excluding persons taking statins, whereas results were
robust for the group without diabetes and the prediabetes
group. This might indicate a mitigating or inhibiting role
of this medication type with regard to inflammatory ef-
fects of air pollution in patients with diabetes, whereas
healthy individuals may not be as susceptible to inflam-
mation as individuals with metabolic disorders. Also, the
stratification into participants with newly diagnosed di-
abetes and those with known type 2 diabetes pointed in
this direction, suggesting an increased susceptibility of
the first subgroup to air pollution exposure that has not
been properly medicated. The exclusion of individuals
with diuretic and/or b-blocker intake mainly affected
the results of the prediabetes group, leading to nonsignif-
icant estimates for all air pollutants in association with
leptin and hs-CRP levels.
The first studies on adverse the health effects of ambient
air pollution mainly looked at respiratory outcomes and
somewhat later on cardiovascular outcomes (39,40). Re-
cent research also suggested a link between air pollution
and type 2 diabetes involving multiple pathophysiological
pathways (11,12,15). Several reviews and meta-analyses
(14–20) have been published since, mainly referring to
the same studies. However, the pooled effect estimates
varied to some extent, depending on the inclusion and
exclusion criteria. As the number of eligible studies is
quite sparse, the meta-analyses usually combined preva-
lent and incident diabetes and could not distinguish be-
tween type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Thus, clear evidence
is still limited because of differences in outcome defini-
tion, exposure metrics, population characteristics, and the
covariates that were considered (14). As IR is a powerful
predictor of the future development of type 2 diabetes, it
came into focus in several recent epidemiological studies
on air pollution (10,24–27,41). However, these studies
either investigated short-term effects or focused on chil-
dren, and, thus, are not directly comparable to our study.
Short- and long-term effects of air pollution are hypoth-
esized to arise partly from different biological pathways,
and recent epidemiological evidence showed that the ad-
verse health effects of long-term exposure are generally
larger than those observed for short-term exposure (42).
In addition, studies among children might be more pro-
nounced due to the children being more vulnerable to
environmental stressors. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study investigating the long-term effects
of air pollution in association with biomarkers of IR in the
general population.
A German study by Teichert et al. (41) used data that
were partly comparable to ours; however, they applied a
different approach to assess the association between long-
term exposure to air pollution, subclinical inflammation,
and impaired glucose metabolism in 363 women. The
authors stratified the women by impaired (defined as
i-IFG or previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by a physi-
cian) versus normal glucose metabolism and compared

 the risk differences in association with air pollution, 14
proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune media-
tors, and fasting glucose and insulin levels. The authors
reported higher odds ratios for NO2 and NOx, but not for
the PM fractions. Among all exposures investigated in our
study, NO2 and NOx effect estimates were the most con-
sistent and most pronounced, although we also observed
an association for the coarse PM fraction. Similar to our
analysis, the study by Thiering et al. (26) was based on
long-term exposure estimates from the ESCAPE project.
The authors looked at HOMA-IR in 397 10-year-old chil-
dren in two prospective German birth cohort studies and
observed increments of 17.0% (95% CI 5.0; 30.3) and
18.7% (95% CI 2.9; 36.9) for increments of 10.6 mg/m3 in
ambient NO2 and 6.0 mg/m3 in PM10. Calderón-Garcidueñas
et al. (27) matched 54 children living in the metropolitan
area of Mexico City, who were thus chronically exposed to
PM2.5 and O3 concentrations above the standards, with
26 control children and found significantly higher leptin
and glucose levels in the first group, but no differences for
insulin and HOMA-IR. Three studies on the short-term ef-
fects of air pollution conducted in highly selected popula-
tions reported higher levels of HOMA-IR in association with
NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 (10,24,25).
Regarding long-term air pollution and the incidence of
type 2 diabetes, only five articles have been published so
far (43–47). Although two studies from the U.S. (43,44)
did not observe an association between diabetes incidence
and long-term air pollution, Coogan et al. (47) reported a
significant risk increase in association with NOx, but not
with PM2.5, in a cohort of black women living in Los Angeles.
A similar pattern was seen in our study, with rather signif-
icant estimates for NOx, but rarely for PM2.5. Also, a pro-
spective study among women from the highly industrialized
Ruhr district (western Germany) observed stronger associa-
tions with NO2 than with PM10 (45). In addition, significant
associations were seen for PM2.5 absorbance and prox-
imity to major roads, which were also associated with
elevated levels of markers related to IR in our analysis.
A further study from the Ruhr area (46) reported higher
effect estimates for PM10 compared with PM2.5, which was
similar to our results.
Biological Mechanism
Potential pathways between air pollution and adverse
cardiometabolic changes may occur through a multitude
of mechanisms. Liu et al. (11) compiled a comprehensive
evaluation of potentially underlying biological mechanisms

 linking air pollution and IR/type 2 diabetes, including pul-
monary and systemic inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum
stress, alterations in glucose and lipid metabolism, and
activation of the central nervous system, among others.
Alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells are ini-
tial cellular sensors of PM. These sensors do not react on
PM per se but more on biological components intrinsic to
PM, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which has a lower
concentration in PM2.5 than in PM10 (11). LPS-binding
protein, a soluble acute-phase protein that binds to bacterial
LPS, has been found to be associated with obesity, metabolic
syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (48). This might be a possible
explanation for the higher effect estimates we and others
observed for PM10 and PMcoarse compared with PM2.5.
Strengths and Limitations
The major strengths of this study are the well-character-
ized nature of the KORA F4 cohort, the standardized and

 comprehensive estimation of residential air pollution
exposure, and the availability of OGTT measurements to
allow for stratification by impaired glucose regulation.
Thus, the study delivered a high degree of representative-
ness in terms of a large number of study participants to
conduct subgroup analyses and a large scale of informa-
tion on patient characteristics for the examination of
potential confounding.
The cross-sectional study design limits our study find-
ings in a way that we have one-time measurements giving
no indication of the sequence of events. The observed ele-
vation of IR-related biomarkers at one time point may
have occurred before the onset of adverse health effects
due to air pollution. Since biomarkers were determined
up to 3 years before the air pollution measurements, it is
not possible to infer causation based on our associations.
However, we are investigating the spatial contrasts of air
pollution. Several studies could show that spatial con-
trasts remained stable for periods of up to 10 years and
longer, even with decreases in concentrations over time
(49,50). Thus, we believe that our LUR models based on
measurements from the years 2008/2009 are not neces-
sarily restricted to this period but may be also valid pre-
dictors of the historic spatial contrasts. With the application
of LUR models to estimate the residential long-term con-
centrations, we cannot rule out the possibility of exposure
misclassification. However, we assume that the measure-
ment error biases our effect estimates toward the null.
Furthermore, disparities in the inferences that can be
drawn from IR measures in people with or without b-cell
failure might have limited the comparability of the results.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our results point to an association between
traffic-related air pollution and biomarkers related to IR,
subclinical inflammation, and adipokines in the general
population. The effect estimates were remarkably high for
individuals with i-IFG, i-IGT, or both, suggesting that this
subgroup is particularly susceptible to adverse health
effects due to air pollution exposure.
