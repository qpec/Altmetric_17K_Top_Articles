Abstract 
Myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a common and severe disease with a consider‑
able social and economic impact. So far, the etiology is not known, and neither a diagnostic marker nor licensed treat‑
ments are available yet. The EUROMENE network of European researchers and clinicians aims to promote cooperation 
and advance research on ME/CFS. To improve diagnosis and facilitate the analysis of clinical trials surrogate markers 
are urgently needed. As a first step for developing such biomarkers for clinical use a database of active biomarker 
research in Europe was established called the ME/CFS EUROMENE Biomarker Landscape project and the results are 
presented in this review. Further we suggest strategies to improve biomarker development and encourage research‑
ers to take these into consideration for designing and reporting biomarker studies.

Biomarker in ME/CFS
Although the exact pathogenesis of myalgic encephalo-
myelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is still 
unknown, the most plausible hypothesis is that it is a 
complex multifactorial syndrome in which immunologi-
cal and environmental factors play a crucial role. In addi-
tion, the severe fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive 
impairment, and autonomic dysfunction that delineate 
the disease point to the involvement of both the nerv-
ous system as well as metabolic disturbances [1]. Infec-
tion by various pathogens, including herpes viruses and 
enteroviruses, but also intracellular bacteria, are known 
as triggers of disease. The complex clinical picture and 
the disagreement on potential pathomechanisms make 
ME/CFS a controversial entity and compel the research 
for disease biomarkers that could aid in the diagnostic 
and clinical management. Biomarker per definition may 
include both markers with a certain sensitivity and speci-
ficity for diagnosing ME/CFS as well as those which may 
allow to classify subtypes of the disease, be of value as 
indicators of prognosis, and to be predictive for response 
to treatment [2].
The EUROMENE ME/CFS Biomarker Landscape 
project
EUROMENE is a network of researchers and clinicians 
from 17 European countries and one COST (Coopera-
tion in Science and Technology) near neighbor coun-
try on ME/CFS supported by the European COST 
program within Horizon 2020 (http://www.cost.eu/
COST_Actions/ca/CA15111).
The aims of EUROMENE are to foster strategies for col-
laboration and harmonization of diagnosis and research, 
and to compile an inventory of clinical and scientific data 
in ME/CFS. The Biomarker working group will also try to

develop guidelines for the usage of biomarkers and syn-
chronization of biomarker research.
As a first step, a database for active biomarker research 
in Europe was established called the EUROMENE 
ME/CFS Biomarker Landscape project. To achieve 
this, EUROMENE members performed a search for 
publications on biomarkers within their countries. 
The search strategy used the medical subject headings 
(MeSH) term “chronic fatigue syndrome”
, which includes 
myalgic encephalomyelitis, and the respective country, 
and selected all publications from the last 5 years (2012–
2016). The searches were reviewed by members of the 
Fig. 1 Biomarker studies were categorized as metabolic, immunological, neurological or infection‑associated. The data was visualized as total 
numbers of studies (size of cake) per category (piece of cake) from each country, and the numbers of active biomarker research groups is indicated 
in the countries. EUROMENE countries are indicated by grey (dark grey countries with published studies, light grey those without studies) and non‑
EUROMENE by white

biomarker working group. Studies not involving patients 
with ME/CFS, non-biomarker, and sole treatment studies 
were excluded, only one review article was included.
A total number of 39 studies were identified. Stud-
ies were categorized as being immunological, infection-
related, metabolic or neurological. We summarize the 
findings in Fig. 1, which shows the number and type of 
studies identified in each country, represented by pie 
charts—their sizes being proportional to the number of 
identified studies, and their pieces representing the dis-
tinct categories of the studies. The number of research 
groups working on ME/CFS biomarkers in the EU coun-
tries is also illustrated in Fig. 1. Countries from which no 
publications on ME/CFS biomarker could be retrieved 
are shown in light green/grey, and European countries 
not participating in the EUROMENE are shown in white. 
The references listed per countries are shown in Table 1.
Studies on immune markers (n = 15) in ME/CFS 
explored immunoglobulins, autoantibodies, cytokines, 
and immune cell phenotype and function (summarized 
in Table 2) [3–17]. Four of 5 of the studies on ME/CFS-
associated infection markers were focused on XMRV and 
confirmed the absence of this virus in European ME/CFS 
cohorts [18–22]. Neurological biomarker studies (n = 4) 
focused on neurotransmitter regulation, but excluded 
imaging and functional studies [23–26]. The papers 
which could be retrieved for potential metabolic mark-
ers (n = 15) studied mitochondrial dysfunction, oxida-
tive stress, cortisol regulation, and more comprehensive 
metabolic pathways [27–41].
Discussion
So far there is no single biomarker available for diagnos-
tic use in ME/CFS. Most studies identified here were 
exploratory in design and lack sex and age-matched con-
trol groups or validation cohorts thus having a low evi-
dence level as summarized for the immune marker studies 
in Table 2 [42]. Some studies report inconsistent data, too. 
For example an expansion of transitional and naïve B cells 
and reduced plasmablast levels was reported in one study 
[14], but could not be confirmed in two other studies [4, 
12]. Immune cell phenotype and function analyses are, of 
course, hampered by variations in sampling and meth-
odological differences between laboratories as most flow 
cytometric assays are not standardized. Further, immu-
nological biomarkers reported mostly show alterations in 
subgroups only or with wide overlap to healthy control 
groups. Such heterogeneous results may be related to the 
fact that subgroups of ME/CFS patients exist with different 
immunological pathomechanisms. This concept is sup-
ported by the existence of clinical subgroups with hetero-
geneity in disease onset (infection- versus non-infection 
triggered), the variability of immune-associated symp-
toms, and the divergent response to B cell depletion ther-
apy [43]. Research activity in infection markers on ME/
CFS across Europe is sparse; however, there is currently no 
evidence from the available literature that there is a spe-
cific serological signature aiding in diagnosis of ME/CFS.
Similar to immunological markers, there is no single 
neurological or metabolic marker with sufficient speci-
ficity and sensitivity as a tool in ME/CFS diagnosis yet. 
However, recent studies analyzing multiple metabolites 
could show specific alterations in the majority of ME/CFS 
patients [37, 44–46] pointing to a probably common and 
specific metabolic profile. Further, metabolic studies con-
sistently revealed different gender-related patterns [37, 
44, 46]. Thus, instead of searching single markers fitting 
for diagnosing all patients, multiplexed determinations 
of biomarkers analyzing pathways together with patient 
stratification, may be necessary to develop diagnostic 
assays with sufficient sensitivity and specificity [47].
Conclusions
Heterogeneity of biomarker studies with different case 
definitions, low number of patients, lack of matched con-
trol groups, missing validation studies and potentially 
subgroup heterogeneity are possible reasons why no

diagnostic biomarkers are available yet. Further, as result 
of the low amount of funding in CFS/ME research few 
and often small studies were performed so far. Therefore, 
strategies to improve the quality and to facilitate the com-
parability of biomarker studies are needed (summarized 
in Table 3). This starts with well-defined patient cohorts

using strict case definitions [47], standardized and quan-
titative symptom assessment for subgroup analyses, 
well-defined age- and sex-matched controls, and large 
enough cohort size and a predefined hypothesis to power 
the statistical analysis. Detailed description of cohorts, 
assays performed and results achieved are important 
to facilitate confirmation studies. Reproducing results 
in cohorts from different countries, developing Stand-
ard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for assays, and multi-
center studies are important steps for evaluating the 
suitability of biomarkers of interest as diagnostic mark-
ers. The building of translational networks of clinical and 
basic research groups like promoted in EUROMENE is 
an important first step to achieve such goals. Finally, to 
promote research it is crucial to increase funding for ME/
CFS which is currently still far below the budget funds 
for most other serious diseases in both the EU and the 
US funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) [48].
