background  Exercise programmes aimed at reducing 
injury have been shown to be efficacious for some 
non-collision sports, but evidence in adult men’s collision 
sports such as rugby union is lacking.
Objective To evaluate the efficacy of a movement 
control injury prevention exercise programme for 
reducing match injuries in adult men’s community rugby 
union players.
Methods 856 clubs were invited to participate in this 
prospective cluster randomised (single-blind) controlled 
trial where clubs were the unit of randomisation. 81 
volunteered and were randomly assigned (intervention/
control). A 42-week exercise programme was followed 
throughout the season. The control programme reflected 
’normal practice’ exercises, whereas the intervention 
focused on proprioception, balance, cutting, landing and 
resistance exercises.  Outcome measures were match 
injury incidence and burden for: (1) all ≥8 days time-loss 
injuries and (2) targeted (lower limb, shoulder, head and 
neck, excluding fractures and lacerations) ≥8 days time-
loss injuries. 
results Poisson regression identified no clear effects on 
overall injury outcomes. A likely beneficial difference in 
targeted injury incidence (rate ratio (RR), 90% CI=0.6, 0.4 
to 1.0) was identified, with a 40% reduction in lower-
limb incidence (RR, 90% CI=0.6, 0.4 to 1.0) and a 60% 
reduction in concussion incidence (RR, 90% CI=0.4, 0.2 to 
0.7) in the intervention group. Comparison between arms 
for clubs with highest compliance (≥median compliance) 
demonstrated very likely beneficial 60% reductions in 
targeted injury incidence (RR, 90% CI=0.4, 0.2 to 0.8) and 
targeted injury burden (RR, 90% CI=0.4, 0.2 to 0.7).
Conclusions The movement control injury prevention 
programme resulted in likely beneficial reductions in 
lower-limb injuries and concussion. Higher intervention 
compliance was associated with reduced targeted injury 
incidence and burden.

influence 
team 
success1 2 and may lead to withdrawal from sports 
participation.3 4 Injuries are also associated with 
secondary degenerative disease including osteoar-
thritis,5 6 which can impact on long-term quality of 
life.7 There has not been a large-scale movement 
control-informed injury prevention randomised 
controlled trial in adult men’s community rugby 
union, despite a need to minimise injury rates to 
maximise sports participation and maintain players’ 
long-term health.
Exercise-based injury prevention interventions 
including FIFA 11+8 focus on reducing lower-limb 
injuries by means of exercises targeting balance, 
coordination, strength and power. In soccer, FIFA 
11+ has been reported to reduce injury incidence 
rates by between 32%9 and 72%.10 However, in addi-
tion to the injury mechanisms common in soccer, 
rugby union (rugby) has additional contact/collision 
events. In community rugby, 80% of match inju-
ries are associated with contact events11 compared 
with 44% in community soccer.12 The high-impact 
collision nature of the rugby tackle13 can result in 
blunt force trauma injuries. For example, fractures 
and lacerations account for 27% of all head inju-
ries.14 Similarly, acromioclavicular joint dislocation 
is the most common rugby shoulder injury,15 where 
the injury mechanism is commonly a direct impact 
of the player’s shoulder with the ground during a 
tackle.16 Such injuries are likely to be difficult to 
prevent through movement control programmes.
Knee and ankle ligament injuries combined with 
hamstring injuries account for 33% of injuries 
overall and are the most common non-contact rugby 
injury diagnoses.11 Importantly, injury prevention 
programmes have reduced knee (70% reduction) 
and ankle sprains (62% reduction)17 as well as 
hamstring strains (70% reduction).18 Although FIFA 
11+ was designed to reduce lower-limb injuries in 
soccer, implementing the programme in basketball 
reduced lower-limb injury by 32%.19 This indicates 
that the type of exercises included in FIFA 11+ may 
be appropriate across sports where lower-limb inju-
ries predominate. Lower-limb injuries are common 
in rugby, but upper-limb and head and neck injuries 
account for 41% of all injuries11 compared with 6% 
in soccer.20 The profile of injuries in community 
rugby therefore warrants a new movement control 
exercise programme.
The aim of this study was to investigate the 
efficacy of a rugby-specific movement control 
programme to reduce injury risk in adult men’s 
community rugby union players.
MeThOds
Trial design and randomisation
This prospective cluster randomised control trial 
was designed in accordance with the CONSORT 
framework for cluster randomised trials.21 The 
playing population from which the study sample 
was recruited has been described previously as 
semi-professional (Rugby Football Union (RFU) 
levels 3–4; highest level of English community

rugby), amateur (RFU levels 5–6) and recreational (RFU levels 
7–9).11 Injury incidence varies across these playing categories,11 
and therefore, recruited clubs were stratified by playing level 
before being randomly allocated to the intervention or control 
group.
ethical approval
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Approval 
Committee for Health, University of Bath, UK (Reference: 
EP14/15142).
sample size
The required sample size was estimated22 at club level, indicating 
54 clubs (27 clubs per trial arm, intervention/control) for a mini-
mally important (α=0.05) injury burden rate ratio (RR) of 0.70 
or less based on expected injury burden of 899 
days/1000 player 
match-hours23 in the control group and anticipated exposure of 
480 player match-hours per club (cluster). This allowed for an 
anticipated 50% drop-out rate and was adjusted for cluster coef-
ficient (k=0.26).23
study setting and recruitment
Between March and June 2015, before the 2015/2016 preseason, 
856 adult men’s community rugby clubs competing in RFU 
league levels 3–9 in England were invited to participate in this 
study (figure 1). Inclusion criteria were that clubs must have 
access to a registered healthcare practitioner for injury diagnoses 
(sports therapists, osteopaths, chiropractors, physiotherapists or 
physicians).
Programme design
Before the 2014/2015 preseason, a review of successful 
injury prevention exercises from different sports settings was 
conducted alongside a review of adult men’s community rugby 
injury epidemiology. An evidence-informed injury prevention 
exercise programme reflecting the injury profile of community 
rugby players was developed following discussion with an expert 
‘Technical Group’ of sports medicine researchers, physiothera-
pists and strength and conditioning specialists that specialised in 
human movement, injury prevention, epidemiology and rehabil-
itation and a rugby coach. The intervention programme included 
proprioceptive, mobility and strengthening exercises within a 
progressive structure targeting the lower limb, shoulder, head and 
neck. The control programme included dynamic stretching and 
non-targeted resistance exercises presented in a similar progres-
sive format to the intervention. A pilot trial was conducted 
during the 2014–2015 season in 16 clubs. Delivery agents (typi-
cally coaches) from pilot study clubs were interviewed at the end 
of this season to determine factors that affected implementa-
tion, following which the exercise programmes were modified. 
Revised programmes were examined by a second expert ‘Tech-
nical Group’ including strength and conditioning coaches, sports 
physiotherapists and sports medicine researchers.
exercise programmes
The final exercise programmes included seven 6-week progres-
sive phases spanning the 2015/2016 rugby preseason and 
inseason period to be used at training sessions (twice weekly) and 
prematch (once weekly). Programmes recommended 5–10 
min 
of small-sided games after which the main content lasted 15 
min. 
The control programme followed a raise, activate, mobilise 
and potentiate format24 incorporating whole-body dynamic 
stretching and resistance exercises, such as partner grappling, 
front planks, press-ups and sprint drills, before finishing with 
high-intensity running exercises. The intervention warm-up 
incorporated balance/proprioceptive exercises, resistance and 
perturbation exercises and sport-related landing, cutting and 
plyometric exercises. Proprioception and balance exercises 
progressed through alterations including the use of upper-limb 
movement, performing the exercises with eyes closed and thus

removing the visual component to balance and by perturba-
tions in frontal and sagittal planes. Dynamic stability exercises 
targeting upper and lower limbs progressed in load by altering 
the number of sets and reps, intensity and by variations in the 
directions of movement. Resistance exercises progressed in dura-
tion or intensity as well as by altering the type of muscle contrac-
tion to include isometric, concentric and eccentric muscle 
activity. Landing, cutting and plyometric exercises varied phase 
to phase but reflected sport-specific skills such as jumping to 
catch a high ball and progressed in difficulty. Variations included 
progressing from a single cutting manoeuvre to a cut, spin and 
accelerate movement pattern. Plyometric exercises progressed 
through each of the phases beginning with lower-load double-
legged tasks to high-load single-legged tasks. Throughout the 
intervention warm-up, there was a consistent theme of quality 
of movement control and body alignment for delivery agents 
to feedback to the players (see online supplementary file for an 
example of one intervention phase). The intervention finished 
with the same high-intensity shuttle running exercises as the 
control programme.
blinding of clubs
Club members were blind to which programme they received. 
Clubs were informed that they were involved in a study eval-
uating the efficacy of different combinations of exercises for 
injury risk reduction and that clubs throughout the country were 
using different exercise combinations. This was deemed a prag-
matic approach to limit contamination due to clubs who, due to 
being randomly assigned, could be situated in close geographical 
proximity to other participating clubs.
Programme delivery
Each club was visited by a ‘programme trainer’ from the 
research group to train each club’s nominated ‘delivery agent’ 
(commonly the strength and conditioning coach) in how to 
deliver the programme to their players. Seventy-four per cent of 
clubs (n=60) received training before the start of preseason and 
26% (n=21) received training before the start of the competitive 
season. T
wo clubs received training less than 5 weeks before the 
start of the season.
data collection
Data were collected during the 2015–2016 English rugby 
union season from July 2015 to May 2016. Clubs nominated 
a programme coordinator to report first team match exposure, 
exercise programme compliance and match injuries on a weekly 
basis using standardised forms. Data collection forms were avail-
able in paper and electronic formats.
Injury definitions
All first-team match injuries that resulted in absence from match 
play for ≥8 days were defined as a ‘time-loss’ injury, including 
both acute and overuse injuries. Injuries were recorded using 
the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (V
.8)25 detailing 
injury type and location. The date a player was fit to play was 
recorded as the return to play date. Overall injury incidence 
refers to injuries with a ≥8 days time-loss. Severe injuries were 
defined as injuries with >28 days time-loss.26 Injury burden 
was defined as the total number of days lost from training or 
match play. Targeted injuries were defined as injuries to the 
lower limb (buttock, hip, upper leg, knee, lower leg, ankle and 
foot), head and neck, or shoulder (glenohumoral joint), with 
diagnoses limited to muscle strains, ligamentous sprains, joint 
and neurological injury that resulted in ≥8 days time-loss. 
Diagnoses including haematoma, laceration/contusion, fracture 
and undiagnosed pain at any body site were excluded from the 
targeted injury analysis.
Outcomes
Injury burden was the primary outcome between trial arms for 
all injuries. Secondary outcomes included overall injury inci-
dence, targeted injury incidence and targeted injury burden.
statistical methods
Data analysis, computed using SPSS (V
.22 for Windows, IBM) 
was performed on an intention-to-treat (last observation carried 
forward) basis with the control clubs as the reference group.
Injury burden (number of days absence per 1000 player 
match-hours) and 90% CIs were estimated vis-à-vis for primary 
and secondary outcome measures of this study. Injury inci-
dence was estimated as the number of injuries per 1000 player 
match-hours. The General Estimating Equation was used to 
conduct Poisson regression analysis and explore the effects of 
the intervention on injury outcomes. Club (cluster) and playing 
level (semiprofessional; amateur; recreational) were included as 
random effects, and analysis was offset for club match exposure. 
Overdispersion was controlled for using a Pearson χ2 scaling 
parameter.27 Club programme compliance was defined by two 
measures: overall club compliance (proportion of all possible 
sessions where the programme was delivered) and the number 
of club programme sessions/week. Overall compliance, adjusted 
for varying lengths of clubs’ participation in the study and the 
proportion of compliant sessions, was measured as the number 
of compliant sessions/total potential compliant sessions. Results 
are presented as RR with 90% 
CI and interpreted using Clini-
cal-Magnitude Based Inferences.28 Ten per cent was considered 
the minimum effect, and threshold values for unlikely/harmful 
(25) and most/very unlikely (0.5)28 were used to derive the OR 
for making clinical inference.
resulTs
Overview
Eighty-one clubs were randomised to the intervention (n=41) 
or control (n=40) arm, of which forty clubs (intervention=19, 
control=21) dropped out or otherwise returned incomplete 
data. Forty-one clubs (intervention=22, control=19) returned 
complete data detailing 255 injuries averaging 5.5±5.7 injuries 
per intervention club and 7.0±5.1 injuries per control club. Total 
player match exposure was 19 
560 
hours (intervention=9900, 
control=9660 
player match-hours), averaging 477±121 
player 
match-hours per club. Across the 41 clubs, 222 different players 
sustained ≥1 
injury. All injuries were reported as acute inju-
ries, and the majority were associated with contact mechanisms 
(contact=199 (78%), non-contact=56 (22%)). Player demo-
graphic information is displayed in table 1.

Overall injuries
Overall injury burden was 649 (90% CI 570 to 740) days/1000 
player match-hours where the incidence (≥8 days time-loss) for 
both trial arms combined was 13.0 (90% CI 11.8 to 14.4) inju-
ries/1000 player match-hours. There were 135 severe injuries 
(>28 
days time-loss) with an incidence of 6.9 (90% CI 6.0 to 7.9) 
injuries/1000 player match-hours. Intention-to-treat analysis indi-
cated no clear difference in overall injury burden (RR, 0.8; 90% 
CI 0.5–1.4), overall injury incidence (RR, 0.9; 90% CI 0.6–1.3) or 
severe injury incidence (RR, 0.8; 90% CI 0.6–1.3) for the interven-
tion compared with control group (table 2 and figure 2).
Targeted injuries
One hundred and fifty-eight injuries (62% of all injuries) across 
both trial arms met the ‘targeted injury’ definition with a burden 
of 448 (90% CI 393 to 510) 
days/1000 player match-hours and 
an incidence of 8.1 (90% CI 7.1 to 9.2) injuries/1000 player 
match-hours. There were 89 severe targeted injuries with an 
incidence of 4.6 (90% CI 3.8 to 5.4) injuries/1000 player match-
hours. Poisson regression analysis indicated no clear difference 
(RR, 0.6; 90% CI 0.3–1.3) in targeted injury burden for the 
intervention (table 3 and figure 3) compared with the control 
group. A likely beneficial 40% (RR, 0.6; 90% CI 0.4–1.0) reduc-
tion in both overall targeted injury incidence and severe targeted 
injury incidence (RR, 0.6; 90% CI 0.3–1.0) was identified for 
the intervention compared with control group.
specific body locations
There was a likely beneficial 70% reduction in both burden (RR, 
0.3; 90% CI 0.2–0.7) and incidence (RR, 0.3; 90% CI 0.2–0.6)

(RR, 0.6; 90% CI 0.4–1.0) reduction in lower-limb injury inci-
dence for the intervention compared with the control group.
Programme compliance
Programme compliance was high and was similar in both inter-
vention (2.1±0.7 
sessions/week, median=85%, IQR=62–90) 
and control (2.2±0.6 
sessions/week, median=83%, IQR=65–
92) study arms. Four clubs (intervention n=3, control n=1) 
completed their programme less than once weekly, 8 clubs 
(intervention n=3, control n=5) completed their programme at 
least once but less than twice weekly and 29 clubs (intervention 
n=16, control n=13) completed their programme at least twice 
weekly.
For clubs that completed the exercise programmes at least 
once weekly (n=37), no clear difference in targeted injury 
burden (RR, 0.7; 90% CI 0.3–2.0) and likely beneficial 40% 
reduction (RR,0.6; 90% CI 0.4–1.0) in targeted injury incidence 
was found for the intervention compared with the control group.
Median compliance was used to divide clubs into higher 
(≥median) and lower (<median) compliance groups. Inter-
vention clubs (n=11) with higher compliance displayed a very 
likely beneficial 60% reduction in both targeted injury burden 
(RR, 0.4; 90% CI 0.2–0.7) and targeted injury incidence 
(RR, 0.4; 90% CI 0.2–0.8) compared with the control clubs with 
higher compliance (n=9).
Within the intervention arm, comparison of clubs with higher 
compliance (n=11) to lower compliance (n=11) indicated 
a likely beneficial 50% reduction (RR, 0.5; 90% CI 0.2–1.2) 
in targeted injury burden with no clear difference (RR, 0.7; 
90% CI 0.4–1.4) in targeted injury incidence for higher compli-
ance clubs.
dIsCussIOn
This is the first cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the 
efficacy of an injury prevention exercise programme to reduce 
injuries in adult men’s community rugby players. No clear differ-
ences were found between intervention and control arms using 
intention-to-treat analysis and established clinical inference 
thresholds for overall injury burden, overall injury incidence or 
severe injury incidence. However, for injuries targeted by the 
intervention, overall injury incidence and severe injury incidence 
were both reduced by 40% in the intervention group compared 
with control, which were clear beneficial effects. Of particular 
note is that the intervention group benefited from a 60% reduc-
tion in concussion and a 40% reduction in lower-limb incidence 
compared with the control group.
Targeted injuries
Concussion was 60% lower for both incidence (1.2 vs 3.4 inju-
ries/1000 player match-hours) and burden (38 vs 102 
days/1000 
player match-hours) in the intervention compared with the 
control group. This reduction is possibly a result of the isometric 
neck conditioning exercises included in every phase of the inter-
vention programme. These exercises were included based on 
existing evidence that isometric neck exercises increase neck 
strength in male rugby players29 and that higher neck strength 
is suggested to decrease head accelerations during rugby colli-
sion events associated with concussion.30 For amateur rugby, this 
finding is very encouraging in the context of a proposed link 
between concussion sustained during a playing career and defi-
cits in cognitive functioning in later life.31 Given the magnitude 
of the difference in concussion incidence between the interven-
tion and control groups in this study, this is evidence to suggest 
that all adult men’s community rugby players should engage in 
weekly neck conditioning exercises.
A likely beneficial reduction of 40% was found for targeted 
lower-limb injury incidence for the intervention group over 
control group (3.3 vs 5.2 injuries/1000 player match-hours). 
The intervention programme incorporated lower-limb balance, 
proprioception and movement control exercises similar in nature 
to exercises in FIFA 11+,32 indicating that this approach is also 
efficacious for reducing injury in rugby, despite the high propor-
tion of contact-related injuries. Intention-to-treat analysis from 
a neuromuscular-control intervention study in community adult 
men’s Australian Rules Football,33 another sport with a high 
level of physical person-to-person contact, displayed a likely 
beneficial 20% reduction (RR, 0.8; 90% CI 0.6–1.0) in lower-
limb injury incidence and a likely beneficial 50% reduction (RR, 
0.5; 90% CI 0.3–1.0) in knee injuries. Given that ~50% of all 
community rugby injuries are lower-limb injuries,11 our findings 
support the completion of these lower-limb exercises as part of a 
warm-up before training and matches.
Shoulder injury incidence (1.7 vs 1.0 injuries/1000 player 
match-hours, respectively) and injury burden (68 vs 45 
days/1000 
player match-hours, respectively) was higher for the 
intervention group over control. Despite the higher rate of 
shoulder injuries, the intervention group had fewer shoulder 
dislocations (1 vs 5 dislocations) but  more muscle/tendon 
injuries (15 vs 4 injuries) than the control group. There is no 
obvious explanation for the higher injury rate in the intervention 
group, though this trial was not powered to detect differences 
in shoulder injury rates as specific outcome. Reduced head and 
neck and lower-limb injuries likely resulted in greater individual 
player match exposure for players in the intervention arm. 
Greater player match exposure may have led to more shoulder 
contact events including tackles, thus increasing the risk for 
shoulder injury. All shoulder injuries were contact injuries and 
therefore may be harder to reduce via conditioning exercises 
alone. As reductions in both shoulder and head injury are likely 
achieved via good tackling technique,34 35 it may be prudent that 
tackle education is recommended alongside implementation of 
this study’s intervention.
Compliance and injury risk
Clubs’ compliance rates were high, reflected by median compli-
ance of 85% for the intervention group and 83% for the control 
group, where on average clubs implemented the programmes 
at least twice/week. Between-group comparison for clubs that 
completed the programme at least once/week during the season 
indicated a 40% reduction in targeted injury incidence for the 
intervention group over the control group. As some clubs only 
train once/week, it is encouraging to find that injury incidence 
was reduced provided clubs implemented the intervention once 
weekly. In soccer, higher FIFA 11+ compliance produced a 
very likely beneficial 35% reduction in injury rates compared 
with intermediate FIFA 11+ compliance.8 In the present study, 
comparison between intervention clubs with higher compliance 
to lower compliance (≥85% 
to <85% of possible sessions) indi-
cated a likely beneficial 50% reduction in targeted injury burden. 
This indicates that additional benefit can be achieved when the 
intervention is implemented in the majority of training sessions 
and before matches.
The control exercises reflected normal ‘good practice’ for this 
level of rugby and consisted of dynamic stretching and non-targeted

resistance exercises. Overall injury incidence in the control group 
was 13.8 (90% CI 11.9 to 15.9) injuries/1000 player match-hours, 
which is 18% lower than the incidence previously reported for 
similar populations of adult men’s community rugby players 
(16.9 injuries/1000 player match-hours; 90% CI 14.9–16.5).11 
Control exercises may have offered better physical preparation for 
players than current ‘normal practice’, which is supported by feed-
back from pilot study delivery agents (unpublished data; Attwood, 
2017). Results may indicate that there is a need to improve 
warm-up practices in this population.
Implementation in the ‘real-world’ setting is needed before 
intervention effectiveness can be determined.36 The full poten-
tial of this intervention programme will only be realised if it is 
adopted, executed correctly and maintained36 37 by community 
rugby clubs. The RFU has identified player welfare as a stra-
tegic priority and is ideally placed to disseminate the interven-
tion to community rugby clubs in England with its employed, 
field-based workforce. However, this will not be without its 
challenges and following nationwide dissemination, interven-
tion programme effectiveness will need to be evaluated using the 
RE-AIM framework.38
strengths and limitations
Random checks of club compliance through unannounced visits 
were not made, which would have increased the validity of 
the compliance results. Regarding compliance, it was assumed 
participants must ‘do as they are told’39 and thus completed their 
programme in full as was designed. The efficacy of the inter-
vention reflects reductions in musculoskeletal injury and concus-
sion found in schoolboy rugby40 using a similar intervention.41 A 
cluster randomised controlled trial reduces biases associated with 
the results and the pragmatic, coach (delivery agent)-led delivery 
approach increased the generalisability of the study results. This 
coach-led, club-based warm-up intervention programme, which 
included balance and proprioception exercises, resistance and 
perturbation exercises and sport-related landing, cutting and 
plyometric exercises, is efficacious in reducing overall targeted 
injury and severe injury in adult men’s community rugby and 
should be implemented nationwide.
COnClusIOn
This is the first cluster randomised controlled trial to examine 
the efficacy of a movement control injury prevention programme 
in adult men’s community rugby players. The intervention 
programme demonstrated clear beneficial effects by reducing 
concussion incidence by 60% and lower-limb injury incidence 
by 40% compared with control. It is recommended that adult 
men’s rugby players complete the intervention programme exer-
cises prior to training and match play.

What are the findings?
 
► This study is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of an injury 
prevention exercise programme in adult men’s community 
rugby.
 
► Performing at least one movement control session per week 
led to reduced injury rates.
 
► Lower-limb injury, head and neck injury and concussion 
were reduced, but shoulder injuries were increased in the 
intervention group undertaking exercises during warm-ups at 
training and before matches.
 
► Higher compliance with the intervention programme was 
associated with the greatest injury reduction.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the near 
future?
 
► The injury prevention exercise programme should be 
performed prior to training and matches in all adult men’s 
rugby union.
 
► Given the evidence for the efficacy of this and similar 
injury prevention exercise programmes, practitioners 
should consider the content of the ‘warm-up’ and consider 
employing the principles of these exercise programmes 
regardless of which sport they are working in.
