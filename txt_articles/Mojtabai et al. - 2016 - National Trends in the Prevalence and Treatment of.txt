abstract
OBJECTIVES: This study examined national trends in 12-month prevalence of major depressive 
episodes (MDEs) in adolescents and young adults overall and in different sociodemographic 
groups, as well as trends in depression treatment between 2005 and 2014.
METHODS: Data were drawn from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health for 2005 to 
2014, which are annual cross-sectional surveys of the US general population. Participants 
included 172 495 adolescents aged 12 to 17 and 178 755 adults aged 18 to 25. Time trends 
in 12-month prevalence of MDEs were examined overall and in different subgroups, as were 
time trends in the use of treatment services.
RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence of MDEs increased from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014 
in adolescents and from 8.8% to 9.6% in young adults (both P < .001). The increase was 
larger and statistically significant only in the age range of 12 to 20 years. The trends 
remained significant after adjustment for substance use disorders and sociodemographic 
factors. Mental health care contacts overall did not change over time; however, the use of 
specialty mental health providers increased in adolescents and young adults, and the use of 
prescription medications and inpatient hospitalizations increased in adolescents.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression in adolescents and young adults has increased 
in recent years. In the context of little change in mental health treatments, trends in 
prevalence translate into a growing number of young people with untreated depression. 
The findings call for renewed efforts to expand service capacity to best meet the mental 
health care needs of this age group.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: There is evidence 
of increased prevalence of depressive symptoms 
in adolescents in industrialized countries in past 3 
decades. Recent suicide trends in the United States 
suggest that depression in adolescents and young 
adults may have continued to increase.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study provides data 
on recent trends in major depressive episodes 
in adolescents and young adults overall and in 
sociodemographic subgroups, as well as trends 
in depression treatment seeking and types of 
treatment.

The risk of depression sharply 
rises as children transition to 
adolescence. 
1 In the US National 
Comorbidity Survey (NCS)-
Adolescent Supplement of 2001 to 
2004, 11.7% of adolescents 13 to 
18 years of age met criteria for a 
lifetime major depressive disorder 
or dysthymia. 
1 Reports of increasing 
antidepressant medication use by 
adolescents before the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) 2003 black-
box warning 
2, 
 
3 and indirect evidence 
of increased lifetime prevalence 
of major depressive disorder in 
successive birth cohorts4 have raised 
concerns about increasing prevalence 
of depression among adolescents. 
Yet, there is little direct information 
from the United States on national 
trends in prevalence of depression in 
adolescents and young adults.
Studies of trends in depression from 
other industrialized countries have 
produced mixed results. 
5 Although 
studies based on rating scales of 
depressive symptoms showed an 
increasing trend over the past 3 
decades, 
 
6 
 
 
 
 
– 
13 a 2006 meta-analysis of 
26 epidemiologic studies on rates of 
current depressive disorder among 
adolescents found no significant 
change between the mid-1960s 
and mid-1990s.14 A more recent 
study 
15 found a declining prevalence 
of severe impairment among US 
adolescents from 1996–1998 to 
2010–2012. 
15 However, this study 
did not assess trends in specific 
disorders and was based on parent 
reports.
Examining temporal trends in 
prevalence of depression among 
young people has implications 
for evaluating whether they have 
benefited from increasing use 
of mental health treatments. 
16 
Characterization of national trends 
in depressive disorders and their 
treatment could also inform 
community efforts to improve access 
to mental health services for young 
people. In the current study, we used 
data from the 2005 to 2014 National 
Surveys on Drug Use and Health 
(NSDUH) on adolescents and young 
adults to examine trends in 12-month 
major depressive episodes (MDEs), 
controlling for sociodemographic 
characteristics and substance use 
disorders. We further examined 
trends in prevalence of MDEs in 
different sociodemographic groups 
and trends in mental health service 
use among adolescents and young 
adults with MDEs. The study 
period covers years following the 
FDA black-box warning regarding 
antidepressant use in youth. 
Stratified regression analyses are 
examined for trends in prevalence 
according to sex, race/ethnicity, age, 
income group, and substance use 
disorders. Trends in service use also 
are evaluated by type of provider, 
type of setting, use of psychiatric 
medications, continuation of 
treatment, and perceived helpfulness 
of treatments.
METHODS
Sample
The NSDUH is a cross-sectional 
annual survey of the US population 
in all 50 states and the District of 
Columbia sponsored by Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration. It provides 
nationally representative data 
on MDE and its treatment among 
the civilian noninstitutionalized 
population aged 12 or older. Persons 
without a household address (eg, 
homeless persons not living in 
shelters), active-duty military, and 
institutional residents are excluded. 
Interviews are conducted by using 
computer-assisted interviewing. 
The NSDUH data collection protocol 
was approved by the institutional 
review board at RTI International 
(Research Triangle Park, NC). NSDUH 
oversamples adolescents and young 
adults.
Overall, 176 245 adolescents aged 
12 to 17 and 180 459 adults aged 
18 to 25 were interviewed in the 
NSDUH 2005 to 2014 and their data 
are available in public use files. The 
annual mean weighted response 
rate of the 2005 to 2014 NSDUH 
was 65.2% 
17 according to Response 
Rate 2 of the American Association 
for Public Opinion Research. 
18 Of 
those interviewed, 172 495 (98.9%) 
adolescents and 178 755 (99.1%) 
young adults responded to structured 
interview questions for 12-month 
MDE and comprised the study 
samples.
Assessments
Lifetime and 12-month MDE 
were assessed using a structured 
interview based on the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. 
Participants were next asked 
whether they had experienced an 
episode in the past year. Questions 
were adapted from the depression 
section of the NCS-Replication. 
4 
Although the validity of the 
NSDUH major depressive disorder 
instrument has not been assessed, 
the validity of the NCS-Replication 
in adults and adolescents has been 
assessed. 
1, 
 
16 In a test-retest reliability 
study of NSDUH interviews, the 
κ values for the of past-year MDE 
ranged from 0.52 in adults to 0.72 
in adolescents, 
 
19 representing 
“moderate” to “substantial 
agreement, 
” respectively.20
Treatments for depression were 
assessed by asking whether during 
the past 12 months participants 
had seen or talked to a medical 
doctor or other professional about 
their depressive symptoms. Types 
of professionals were aggregated 
into mental health providers 
(psychologist, psychiatrist, or 
psychotherapist; social worker; 
counselor, other mental health 
professional), general medical 
providers (general practitioner or 
family doctor; other medical doctor; 
a nurse, occupational therapist, 
or other health professional), and 
complementary/alternative medicine

(CAM) providers (eg, a religious or 
spiritual advisor; alternative healers, 
such as an herbalist). Participants 
were next asked if they were 
currently receiving treatment or 
counseling. In addition, participants 
were asked if during the past 12 
months they had taken medication 
that was prescribed for their 
depression and whether they were 
taking such medication at the time 
of interview. Two further questions 
assessed how much treatment or 
counseling had helped and how 
much prescription medication had 
helped, with responses ranging from 
“not at all” to “extremely.” Questions 
regarding treatment of depression 
were asked only among participants 
with positive responses to the MDE 
questions.
Treatment setting was assessed 
only in adolescents by a series of 
questions concerning where they 
received “treatment or counseling 
in the past 12 months for emotional 
or behavioral problems that were 
not caused by alcohol or drugs.” 
Participants were further asked 
about the reason for their service 
use. Although these questions were 
not limited to participants with MDE, 
in our analyses we examined only 
settings in which adolescents had 
sought care because they had “felt 
depressed.” The settings included 
“a private therapist, psychologist, 
psychiatrist, social worker, or 
counselor, 
” “a mental health clinic 
or center, 
” “a partial day hospital 
or day treatment program, 
” and 
staying overnight in “any type 
of hospital” or in “a residential 
treatment center.” Participants were 
also asked about treatment from 
“an in-home therapist, counselor, 
or family preservation worker” and 
from “a school social worker, a school 
psychologist, or a school counselor.” 
The wording of questions regarding 
school services changed in 2009. 
Therefore, we examined this question 
using the 2009 to 2014 NSDUH data.
Treatment seeking for any mental 
health problems was assessed 
differently in adolescents and young 
adults. All adolescent participants 
were asked if they had received 
care for “emotional or behavioral 
problems that were not caused by 
alcohol or drugs.” Similarly, all adult 
participants were asked if they had 
received treatment or counseling for 
“problems with emotions, nerves or 
mental health, 
” excluding treatment 
of alcohol or drug use. We limited 
the analyses of these questions to 
participants with 12-month MDE.
Substance use disorder ratings 
were based on individual diagnostic 
criteria from the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fourth Edition on past 
12-month abuse and dependence of 
alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs 
(including cocaine, hallucinogens, 
heroin, inhalants, non–medically 
used prescription pain relievers, 
sedatives, tranquilizers, or 
stimulants). Substance use disorders 
were categorized into alcohol use 
disorder only, cannabis use disorder 
(without alcohol use disorder), other 
drug use disorder (without alcohol 
use disorder), and any drug use 
disorder with alcohol use disorder.
Information also was collected on 
participant age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
annual family income, student 
status, parents in the household (for 
adolescents), employment status (for 
those aged 14+) and marital status 
(adults).
Statistical Analyses
Analyses were conducted in 3 stages. 
First, trends in the prevalence of 
12-month MDE across the 10 years 
of NSDUH were assessed by using 
adjusted binary logistic regression 
models. The adjusted model included 
sociodemographic variables and 
substance use disorders in addition 
to the survey year variable. Because 
the association between survey year 
and 12-month MDE did not appear to 
be linear in preliminary analyses, the 
mvrs routine of Stata 14 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX) for regression 
spline was used to fit the data (see 
Supplemental Information). 
21
Second, we conducted stratified 
analyses and interaction tests to 
examine whether the observed 
trends in 12-month MDE 
were consistent across major 
sociodemographic groups. The 
transformed predictor variables 
obtained in the first stage of the 
analyses were used as predictors in 
the stratified analyses.
In the third stage, we examined 
trends in depression treatment 
overall and by provider type and 
setting by using binary logistic 
models. Trends in perceived 
helpfulness of treatments were 
similarly assessed. These analyses 
were limited to respondents with 
12-month MDE. In addition to 
sociodemographics and substance 
use disorders, these models adjusted 
for health insurance coverage and 
receipt of substance use disorder 
treatment.
All analyses were conducted by using 
Stata 14, taking into account the 
complex survey design and sampling 
weights of NSDUH; α was set at 
P < .01.
RESULTS
Of the 172 495 adolescents 
and 178 755 young adults who 
responded to 12-month MDE 
questions, 15 529 (8.7%) and 15 603 
(8.6%), respectively, met criteria 
for 12-month MDE. Background 
characteristics by MDE are 
presented in Supplemental Table 4. 
In comparison with adolescents 
without MDE, those with MDE 
included a disproportionate number 
of older adolescents, nonstudents, 
unemployed individuals, adolescents 
from households with no parents or 
with single parents, and adolescents 
with substance use disorders. 
Adolescents with MDE also were less

MOJTABAI et al 
likely to be boys than girls and non-
Hispanic black than non-Hispanic 
white (Supplemental Table 4). The 
sociodemographic correlates of MDE 
in young adults were somewhat 
similar to those in adolescents. 
Compared with young adults without 
MDE, those with 12-month MDE were 
proportionately less likely to be men 
and non-Hispanic black compared to 
non-Hispanic white and more likely 
to have a substance use disorder. 
Young adults with 12-month 
MDE were also more likely to be 
unemployed or employed part-time, 
compared to employed full-time; 
widowed, divorced or separated, or 
never married, compared to married 
or living as married; and less likely 
to have an annual family income of 
$20 000 to $75 000, compared to 
<$20, 
000 (Supplemental Table 4).
In adolescents, the prevalence of 
12-month MDE was stable over the 
2005 to 2011 period; however, it 
gradually increased in later years 
( 
Fig 1), growing from 8.7% (2005) 
to 11.3% (2014) corresponding 
to a 37% increase in odds (odds 
ratio [OR] 1.37, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.27–1.48, P < .001). 
These proportions translate into 
an increase of more than a half 
million adolescents with 12-month 
MDE between 2005 (approximately 
2 200 000) and 2014 (approximately 
2 700 000). The change was more 
modest for the young adult group: 
from 8.8% to 9.6% (OR 1.13, 95% CI 
1.05–1.22, P = .001).
A spline regression model with 2 
basis functions provided the best-
fitting model for both adolescents 
and young adults (see Supplemental 
Information). These transformed 
predictors were used in the 
regression models, the results of 
which are presented in  
Table 1.
For adolescents, a similar increasing 
trend was observed across age, 
income, and substance use disorder 
strata ( 
Table 1); however, the trend 
was somewhat stronger among 
girls than boys, with the interaction 
test approaching significance (P = 
.020). Among girls, the prevalence 
of 12-month MDE increased from 
13.1% (2004) to 17.3% (2014); 
whereas, among boys the prevalence 
increased from 4.5% (2004) to 5.7% 
(2014) ( 
Table 1). Furthermore, the 
increasing trend was smaller and 
statistically nonsignificant in non-
Hispanic black adolescents, although 
the interaction test for race/ethnicity 
was not statistically significant 
( 
Table 1).
Among young adults, the increasing 
trend in prevalence of 12-month MDE 
was limited to those in the 18 to 20 
age range ( 
Table 1). The prevalence 
did not appreciably change in the 
21 to 25 age range. The interaction 
test with age group was statistically 
significant (P < .01). Furthermore, 
the trend was statistically significant 
only among the non-Hispanic whites. 
However, the interaction test with 
race/ethnicity only approached a 
trend-level statistical significance 
(P = .012).
The proportion of adolescents with 
12-month MDE who received mental 
health counseling or treatment in the 
past 12 months for their depression 
from any type of provider did not 
significantly change over the 2005 
to 2014 period ( 
Table 2). However, a 
larger proportion of adolescents with 
12-month MDE reported care from 
specialty mental health providers, in 
private mental health care settings, 
in inpatient or day treatment 
settings, and in multiple settings. 
Furthermore, adolescents with 
12-month MDE who had received 
any treatment or counseling in the 
past year were more likely in recent 
years to report being currently in 
treatment. A larger proportion of 
adolescents with 12-month MDE 
also reported receiving prescription 
medication for their depression 
in recent years. There was no 
significant trend in the percentage of 
adolescents who perceived treatment 
overall or medication treatment as 
helpful ( 
Table 2).
There were fewer statistically 
significant changes in treatment 
seeking over time among young 
adults ( 
Table 3). Only the proportion 
of young adults with 12-month 
MDE who received depression care 
from specialty mental health care 
providers increased significantly over 
the study period.
DISCUSSION
Each year almost 1 in 11 adolescents 
and young adults have an MDE. 
The prevalence of these episodes 
increased between 2005 and 2014. 
The trend was limited to those in 
the 12 to 20 age range, and was 
somewhat more prominent among 
non-Hispanic whites than minority 
groups and among adolescent girls 
than boys.
Adjusting the analyses for 
sociodemographic and household 
factors that have been previously 
found to be associated with 
adverse mental health outcomes in

adolescents, such as single parent 
homes or income, did not account for 
the increasing trend in depression. 
Furthermore, the trends could 
not be explained by any changes 
in prevalence of substance use 
disorders as the analyses adjusted for 
alcohol and nonalcohol drug abuse 
and dependence. Analyses of NSDUH 
and other US surveys have not 
identified any meaningful increase 
in prevalence of substance use or 
misuse among adolescents over the 
period covered by this study. 
17, 
 
22
The trends in adolescents were 
different among boys and girls. This 
aligns with past studies that also 
found a larger increase in depressive 
symptoms in girls than boys in more 
recent years, 
 
5 and recent data on 
trends in suicide in the United States 
that identified a greater increase 
among adolescent girls and young 
women. 
23 Adolescent girls may have 
been exposed to a greater degree 
to depression risk factors in recent 
years. For example, cyberbullying 
may have increased more 
dramatically among girls than boys. 
24 
As compared with adolescent boys, 
adolescent girls also now use mobile 
phones with texting applications 
more frequently and intensively 
25 
and problematic mobile phone use 
among young people has been linked 
to depressed mood.26 Interestingly, 
the sex differences in trends were not 
consistent across age groups, as the 
prevalence of depression followed 
similar temporal trends in young 
men and women.
The differences in trends may also 
represent an increase in prevalence 
of stressful reactions and behaviors 
that have similar features to 
depression. For example, there is 
some evidence that the prevalence 
of nonsuicidal self-injury, 
 
27 
– 
29 
which has some similar features to 
MDEs and may be comorbid with 
depressive episodes, has increased in 
recent years, especially in adolescent 
girls. 
30 However, the extent to which 
the observed temporal trends in 
MDEs are confounded by such stress 
reactions is difficult to ascertain in 
NSDUH, as the survey only assessed 
MDEs.
The causes of the observed 
trends remain elusive. These 
trends coincided with a major 
economic downturn that affected 
the mental health of all ages in 
many communities. 
31 
 
 
–35 However, 
consistent with a previous report 
of no change in the prevalence of 
adult MDE in the United States over 
a similar time period, 
 
36 no change in 
the prevalence of MDE was noted in 
the 21 to 25 age range.
We did not observe many 
significant changes in mental health 
treatment among adolescents and 
young adults with 12-month MDE 
over the 2005 to 2014 period. 
The use of specialty mental health 
providers increased in both age 
groups and the use of inpatient 
and day treatment settings, as 
well as medication, increased in 
adolescents. Most of the increases 
in the use of these services were 
limited to the years after 2011. This 
is broadly consistent with previous 
evidence indicating that clinician 
diagnoses of mental disorders, use 
of psychotherapy, and visits to 
psychiatrists did not appreciably 
change between 2003 and 2010. 
37 
In view of the growing prevalence 
of MDE in these age groups, stable 
treatment rates translate into 
a growing number of untreated 
depressed adolescents. These 
trends suggest that little progress 
has been made in narrowing the 
mental health treatment gap for 
adolescent depression. This lack 
of progress may reflect lingering 
reluctance on the part of providers 
to diagnose and treat depression 
in the wake of the FDA’s black-
box warning regarding the use of 
antidepressants. 
2, 
 
3
Most adolescents receive routine 
primary care in pediatric settings, 
providing opportunities to detect 
and treat depression. There also

have been efforts by a number of 
professional bodies, most notably 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
Task Force on Mental Health, to 
promote diagnosis and management 
of depression and other common 
mental disorders in pediatric 
settings and to provide resources 
for practice enhancements, such as 
diagnostic guidelines. 
38 
– 
40 With the 
wider adoption of the medical home 
model under the Affordable Care Act, 
integrative approaches to depression 
treatment in pediatric primary care 
will likely increase. 
41
The increasing use of inpatient and 
day treatment settings over the 
2005 to 2014 period may reflect 
greater intensity of treatment of 
adolescents. These trends may be 
related to enhanced mental health 
coverage in recent years after parity 
legislation, which may also explain 
greater continuity in treatment in 
more recent years. 
42 However, these 
findings need to be corroborated in 
future studies, especially with regard 
to increased inpatient treatment that 
was most prominent in 2014.
The findings should be interpreted 
in the context of several limitations. 
Most notably, the study was based 
on self-reports by adolescents and 
may not correspond with parent, 
teacher, or clinical assessments. 
15 
Variations in sources of information 
would likely affect estimates of 
prevalence of disorders, but are 
unlikely to affect temporal trends. 
Furthermore, self-reports may 
be more sensitive than parental 
reports for capturing internalizing 
disorders, such as depression. 
43, 
 
44 
A second limitation is that NSDUH 
assessed only MDE. Temporal trends 
in prevalence of other common 
mental disorders in these age groups 
may be different.

In the context of these limitations, 
this study provides useful

information on temporal trends 
in 12-month MDE and treatment 
of depression based on large and 
nationally representative samples 
of adolescents and young adults. 
Prevention, early detection, and 
treatment of depression and 
other common mental disorders 
in these age groups are major 
goals of public mental health 
initiatives. Yet adaptation and 
broad implementation of effective 
treatment and prevention 
programs remains a challenge. 
45, 
 
46 
The growing number of 
depressed adolescents and young 
adults who do not receive any 
mental health treatment for their 
MDE calls for renewed outreach 
efforts, especially in school and 
college health and counseling 
services and pediatric practices 
where many of the untreated 
adolescents and young adults with 
depression may be detected and 
managed.
