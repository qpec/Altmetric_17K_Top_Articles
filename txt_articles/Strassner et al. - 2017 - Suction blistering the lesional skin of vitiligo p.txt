Abstract
Background—Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease of the skin with limited treatment options; 
there is an urgent need to identify and validate biomarkers of disease activity to support vitiligo 
clinical studies.
Objective—To investigate potential markers of disease activity directly in the skin of vitiligo 
subjects and healthy subjects.
Methods—Patient skin was sampled via a modified suction blister technique allowing for 
minimally invasive, objective assessment of cytokines and T cell infiltrates in interstitial skin fluid. 
Potential biomarkers were first defined and later validated in separate study groups.
Results—In screening and validation, CD8+ T cell number and CXCL9 protein concentration 
were significantly elevated in active lesional compared to non-lesional skin. CXCL9 protein 
concentration achieved greater sensitivity and specificity by ROC analysis. Suction blistering also 
allowed for phenotyping of the T cell infiltrate, which overwhelmingly expresses CXCR3.
Limitations—A small number of patients were enrolled for the study, including a single patient 
to define the treatment response.
Conclusion—Measuring CXCL9 directly in the skin may be effective in clinical trials as an 
early marker of treatment response. Additionally, use of the modified suction blister technique 
supports investigation of inflammatory skin diseases using powerful tools like flow cytometry and 
protein quantification.

 Introduction
Vitiligo is a common autoimmune disease of the skin that causes disfiguring depigmented 
macules and patches1. Depigmentation is the result of CD8+ T cell-mediated killing of 
melanocytes, the pigment producing cells in the skin2. Phototherapy and topical 
immunosuppressants are used off label, with moderate results that require long treatment 
courses. Based on studies in our mouse model and human tissues3,4, we hypothesized that 
targeting the IFN-γ/CXCL10 axis could be an effective new treatment strategy for vitiligo5. 
Recent case reports revealed that JAK inhibitors, which block IFN-γ signaling, are effective 
at reversing vitiligo6,7, supporting our hypothesis. Clinical trials to test new, targeted 
treatments for vitiligo are on the horizon.
When conducting clinical trials in vitiligo, monitoring disease activity will be critical for 
measuring the treatment response. A common misconception is that biomarkers of treatment 
response are unnecessary, since the skin can be observed clinically; however, even the 
earliest clinical changes in vitiligo take 2-3 months to become apparent due to the time 
required for melanocyte precursors to proliferate, migrate, differentiate, and produce 
pigment. Measurable responses require 6 months or more, and current outcome measures are 
largely subjective and insensitive to small changes 8,9. Thus, relying only on observable 
changes in skin pigmentation is problematic.
Recent studies reported that serum levels of IFN-y-induced chemokines are elevated in 
patients with active vitiligo4,10 and correlate with treatment responses10. Serum chemokine 
levels, while reflecting general trends of disease activity in large cohorts, are likely too 
variable to serve as sensitive and specific markers of disease activity in a single patient. 
Moreover, patients with other autoimmune diseases exhibit increased inflammatory markers 
in the serum as well11,12, precluding their use as specific markers in vitiligo. Measuring 
markers directly in the skin could be a more sensitive and specific approach, however 
conventional analysis of skin through immunohistochemistry is problematic because lesions 
have low numbers of infiltrating T cells that are difficult to detect and quantify, unlike more 
inflammatory diseases. Thus, a more efficient method to sample vitiligo lesional skin and 
reliably measure treatment responses is needed.
We adapted a minimally invasive, non-scarring skin biopsy technique13-17 to reliably and 
accurately sample vitiligo lesions by inducing suction blisters, which provide blister fluid 
(consisting of interstitial skin fluid18) for analysis. Lesional blister fluid revealed an infiltrate 
of CD8+ T cells and CXCL9 protein that was both sensitive and specific for disease activity, 
in contrast to analysis of patient blood and serum. Suction blistering provides an opportunity 
to sample lesional skin in patients in a minimally invasive way, while yielding highly useful 
material to study markers of disease activity for translational studies and treatment responses 
in clinical trials.

 Materials and Methods
Study design
Subjects were recruited into two sequential groups for this study: The first to define markers 
of disease activity in vitiligo, and the second to independently validate these markers in a 
separate, non-overlapping group of subjects (Table 1). Inclusion/exclusion criteria were as 
follows: subjects with a diagnosis of vitiligo by clinical exam performed by a dermatologist 
and who were off treatment for at least 6 weeks were included in screening and validation 
groups. Subjects with recent onset of new lesions and objective clinical signs of activity, 
specifically confetti-like macules and/or trichrome lesions, were recruited to represent the 
“active” subgroup. Subjects with stable disease were selected based on their report of no 
recent change in their lesions and no objective clinical signs of disease activity (no confetti, 
trichrome, or inflammatory lesions and no koebner phenomenon). Those on treatment, with 
other inflammatory skin diseases, or presenting with the segmental subtype of vitiligo were 
excluded from the study. One subject was blistered repeatedly before and after starting 
treatment to define the treatment response.
Suction blister skin biopsy and fluid aspiration was performed under IRB-approved 
protocols at UMMS and all samples were de-identified before use in experiments. Active 
vitiligo lesions were chosen based on a one-month history of new lesions and the presence 
of confetti-like depigmentation or trichrome lesions19,20. In stable subjects, selected sites 
were along the lesional edge with overlap between normal and depigmented skin. Non-
lesional sites were selected as normal-appearing, non-depigmented skin when examined by 
Wood’s lamp, at least 5 cm from the nearest depigmented macule.
Blister Induction and Processing
Suction blisters (1 cm in diameter) were induced on the skin using the Negative Pressure 
Instrument Model NP-4 (Electronic Diversities, Finksburg MD). The suction chambers were 
applied to the skin with 10-15 mm Hg of negative pressure and a constant temperature of 
40°C; blisters formed between 30-60 minutes after initiation of the procedure. After blister 
formation, the blister fluid was aspirated through the roof using a 1 mL insulin syringe (Fig 
1). Cells within the blister fluid were pelleted at 330×g for 10 minutes for cell staining and 
the supernatant was collected and frozen for future analysis by ELISA. Occasionally (9% of 
blisters) hemorrhage occurred in the blister, and these were excluded from analysis because 
the infiltrate more closely reflected that of the blood than the interstitial skin (data not 
shown).
ELISA and Flow Cytometry

Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software. Dual comparisons were 
made with the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test for nonparametric data. Groups of 
three or more were analyzed by Kruskall-Wallis with Dunn’s post-tests for nonparametric 
data. Multiplicity adjusted p values from the Dunn’s post-tests are reported as post-test p

 values. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine 
the sensitivity and specificity of tests performed on blister samples. P values < 0.05 were 
considered significant.
Results
T cell infiltrates are elevated in active vitiligo lesions
As CD8+ T recruitment to the skin is required for depigmentation4, we examined the T cell 
number in the skin as a potential biomarker for active disease. Flow cytometry of blister 
fluid in the screening group initially revealed that active lesional sites had a larger infiltrate 
of CD8+ T cells than non-lesional sites, or when compared to the skin of healthy individuals 
(Fig 2A and Supplementary Figure 1). We and others reported that skin-infiltrating CD8+ T 
cells express CXCR3, their receptor, when analyzed by IHC4,10,21. Here we found that 
CD8+ T cells uniformly express CXCR3 in the skin by flow cytometry (Fig 2B), supporting 
previous results.
We then sought to quantify the number of T cells in each blister. Lesional sites on average 
had a 2-fold increased infiltrate of CD8+ T cells with a mean of 2727 normalized cells to 
1305 normalized cells in non-lesional skin (ANOVA all sites, p = 0.0009; t test lesional to 
non-lesional, post-test p = 0.0185; t test lesional to healthy, post-test p = 0.0015). There were 
no appreciable differences in infiltrates between non-lesional sites of active patients and 
healthy control skin (Fig 2C). We also found that total CD3+ T cell number is significantly 
higher in active lesional skin with an average difference of 1.4 fold (7651 Lesional, 5491 
Non-Lesional p = 0.0015). Although CD4+ number in the skin was elevated in the defining 
group, comparisons did not reach statistical significance in the validation group or when the 
total data was compiled (Supplementary Figure 2). We then used a ROC analysis to test 
whether CD8+ T cell number could be used to predict disease activity and found it had 
reasonable predictive value (Fig 2D): a threshold of 1175 normalized CD8+ T cells achieved 
a sensitivity of 70% with specificity of 64%.
We next completed the same analyses in a second group of subjects to validate our 
observations and found similar results: lesional infiltrates contained significantly higher 
CD8+ T cells than in non-lesional sites (post-test p = 0.0494). This group also included four 
subjects with stable vitiligo, and T cell number in active vitiligo lesions was greater than that 
of stable lesional and stable non-lesional skin (post-test p < 0.0001 and post-test p < 0.0001, 
respectively) (Fig 2E). ROC analysis of this group revealed that a threshold of 2766 
normalized CD8+ T cells yields 83% sensitivity and 92% specificity (Fig 2F).
Skin CXCL9 protein is a more sensitive and specific marker of disease activity than 
CXCL10
We previously reported that CXCL9 and CXCL10 RNA transcripts were elevated in lesional 
skin of vitiligo patients4. CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells use CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 to 
traffic towards sites of inflammation22 and CXCL10 is functionally required for the 
progression and maintenance of vitiligo4. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 
(ELISA), we found that CXCL9 was significantly elevated in lesional blister fluid compared

 to non-lesional skin and healthy controls and predicted disease activity better than CD8+ T 
cell numbers (Fig 3A). When we examined CXCL10 in the skin of vitiligo patients, we 
discovered it was not significantly higher in the active lesional skin and did not have good 
predictive value for disease activity (Fig 3B). When we evaluated CXCL9 as a candidate 
biomarker in the second validation group, we detected an average 5.5 fold difference 
between active lesional site and non-lesional skin (post-test p = 0.0492). ROC analysis 
suggests CXCL9 is a more sensitive and specific marker of disease activity than T cell 
number, achieving a threshold value of 1177 pg/mL with 100% sensitivity and 93% 
specificity (Fig 3C). We also evaluated CXCL10 in the skin of patients in the validation 
group and found similar results as the first group, although this time CXCL10 was 3.5 fold 
higher in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin (post-test p = 0.0243). Despite 
detecting elevated levels of CXCL10 in active disease, these differences did not significantly 
increase the predictive value of CXCL10 (Fig 3D). In initial subjects, CXCL11 and IFN-γ 
were only detected at low levels if at all, and lesional levels of these chemokines were not 
elevated compared to non-lesional sites or healthy control skin despite having elevated 
CXCL9 and CXCL10 (Supplementary Fig 3). Thus, we did not measure these cytokines in 
the remaining subjects.
It was previously reported that serum CXCL9 and CXCL10 were significantly elevated in a 
large cohort of vitiligo patients compared to healthy controls and that upon intervention, the 
levels of CXCL10, but not CXCL9, experience a significant drop10. However we did not see 
a correlation between serum chemokines and disease activity in either cohort or in the total 
group when both cohorts were combined (Fig 4A-C), perhaps due to low sample size or our 
selection of patients with active disease phenotypes. Serum levels of CXCL11 and IFN-γ 
were either undetectable or not significantly different in sampled patients (Fig 4D).
Case Study: CXCL9 protein is most responsive to multimodal treatment at an early time 
point
We followed one patient who was undergoing treatment for vitiligo using NB-UVB 
phototherapy and alternating topical tacrolimus and clobetasol. We sampled the same 
locations where the patient exhibited confetti on the first visit and at each subsequent visit. 
After the first four months, the patient reported inconsistent use of treatment, and no 
treatment for the previous 4 weeks. At this time, her T cell number remained largely 
unchanged, yet after an additional four months of consistent phototherapy and tacrolimus 
use, CD8+ T number declined 2-fold. However the non-lesional CD8+ T cell count also 
decreased, such that the lesional to non-lesional ratio remained unchanged (Fig 5A). 
Interestingly, lesional CXCL9 was decreased at the 2nd visit and undetectable at the 3rd visit 
(Fig 5B). Serum CXCL9 was undetectable at the final visit as well (Fig 5C). Lesional and 
serum CXCL10 was decreased at both visits (Fig 5C and 5D).
Discussion
We adapted a modified suction blister protocol to sample lesional skin from vitiligo patients 
and address the need for markers of disease activity and early treatment response. Our 
testing of potential biomarkers was founded upon observations made in our mouse model of

 vitiligo and in vitiligo patients. Thus, this work was hypothesis directed rather than a screen 
of multiple unrelated parameters. While both CD8+ T cell number and CXCL9 in the blister 
fluid demonstrated good predictive value in identifying those with active disease, CXCL9 
had better sensitivity and specificity, and CXCL10 correlated only weakly.
In contrast to previous studies4,10, we could not use serum chemokine levels to distinguish 
those with active disease from those with stable disease or even healthy controls. This may 
be due to the small number of subjects enrolled in this study compared to other studies, or 
may be due to patient selection for this study (highly active confetti or trichrome patterns). 
Either way, it highlights the limitations of using serum markers to reliably measure disease 
activity in individual patients, and the advantage of skin-specific analyses.
Our results also indicate that blister fluid CD8+ T cell infiltration and CXCL9 protein are not 
induced by the blistering process itself, since non-lesional sites showed minimal levels of 
both. CXCL10 was elevated in the non-lesional skin of some subjects, which could be 
partially from blister trauma and might explain why it is a less specific marker using this 
method. Alternatively, CXCL9 protein may be more bioavailable for detection by ELISA 
than CXCL10 in blister fluid based on their different spatial and temporal expression in the 
skin23, binding affinities to structural elements24,25, and/or oligomerization within tissues26. 
We previously reported that both CXCL9 and CXCL10 had functional roles in our mouse 
model of vitiligo, however only CXCL10-deficient mice were protected from clinical 
disease4. Although both chemokines are expressed in active disease, they are produced by 
different cell types and with different kinetics during vitiligo progression23. CXCL9 is 
expressed earliest in murine vitiligo lesions and may be a more specific marker of disease 
activity23.
These markers may provide important information to support clinical trials: 1) to efficiently 
identify and enroll subjects with active IFN-γ-specific inflammation; 2) to reveal early 
treatment responses and drug efficacy; and 3) to improve the sensitivity of current, 
subjective outcomes measures. Future studies will further characterize these markers and 
their sensitivity to change following treatment in a larger patient cohort, where subgroup 
analysis based on disease variants or subject demographics could provide additional clues 
for categorizing vitiligo. Future studies could assess the effects of sun exposure on these 
parameters; our data was gathered primarily in the colder months in the Northeast, where 
sun exposure is less intense. Finally, this modified suction blister technique provides an 
unparalleled opportunity to sample lesions in patients with other inflammatory skin diseases 
to study the natural history of these diseases and their treatment responses.
