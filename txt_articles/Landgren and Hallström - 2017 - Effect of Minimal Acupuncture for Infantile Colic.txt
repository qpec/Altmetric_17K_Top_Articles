 Effect of minimal acupuncture
for infantile colic: a multicentre,
three-armed, single-blind,
randomised controlled trial
(ACU-COL)
Kajsa Landgren, Inger Hallström
ABSTRACT
Background Evidence for treating infantile colic
with acupuncture is contradictory.
Aim To evaluate and compare the effect of two
types of acupuncture versus no acupuncture in
infants with colic in public child health centres
(CHCs).
Methods A multicentre, randomised controlled,
single-blind, three-armed trial (ACU-COL)
comparing two styles of acupuncture with no
acupuncture, as an adjunct to standard care,
was conducted. Among 426 infants whose
parents sought help for colic and registered their
child’s fussing/crying in a diary, 157 fulfilled the
criteria for colic and 147 started the
intervention. All infants received usual care plus
four extra visits to CHCs with advice/support
(twice a week for 2 weeks), comprising gold
standard care. The infants were randomly
allocated to three groups: (A) standardised
minimal acupuncture at LI4; (B) semi-
standardised individual acupuncture inspired by
Traditional Chinese Medicine; and (C) no
acupuncture. The CHC nurses and parents were
blinded. Acupuncture was given by nurses with
extensive experience of acupuncture.
Results The effect of the two types of
acupuncture was similar and both were superior
to gold standard care alone. Relative to baseline,
there was a greater relative reduction in time
spent crying and colicky crying by the second
intervention week (p=0.050) and follow-up
period (p=0.031), respectively, in infants
receiving either type of acupuncture. More
infants receiving acupuncture cried <3 hours/day,
and thereby no longer fulfilled criteria for colic,
in the first (p=0.040) and second (p=0.006)
intervention weeks. No serious adverse events
were reported.
Conclusions Acupuncture appears to reduce
crying in infants with colic safely.

INTRODUCTION
Excessive crying in infants is a problem
for 10–20% of families, causing pain in
the infant and stress in the family.1 2 If
crying and/or fussing exceeds 3 hours/day
for >3 days/week, it is defined as infant-
ile colic.3 The colic may be resolved if
cow’s
milk
protein
is
eliminated.4
Nutritional supplements of Lactobacillus
reuteri might also be effective.5 However,
the effectiveness and safety of other con-
ventional treatments remains unproven.
Standardised acupuncture grounded in
neurophysiology is a W
estern approach,
while
the
hypothesis
in
Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM) is that the
effect of acupuncture depends on which
points are used. While some argue that
needling sensation (de qi) is necessary,
others
have
demonstrated
beneficial
effects with minimal stimulation. There is
a need for further research to compare
standardised
and
individualised
treat-
ment, as well as to determine the optimal
stimulation
parameters
and
treatment
intervals.6
It is plausible that acupuncture may
have positive effects in infantile colic as it
is
recognised
to reduce
pain,
restore
gastrointestinal
function
and
have
a
calming effect.7 No serious side effects
have been reported to date.8–11
Acupuncture is sometimes used to treat
infantile
colic,
despite
sparse
and

 conflicting evidence.12 Until now, only three rando-
mised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for
infantile colic have been published.8 10 11 Of these,
the first two trials8 11 reported a significant reduction
in crying following minimal acupuncture (MA) at LI4
compared to no acupuncture. The first trial8 involved
bilateral needling at LI4 for 20 s, while the second11
applied unilateral needling at LI4 for only 2 s. By con-
trast, the third trial10 evaluated the effect of 30 s of
acupuncture at ST36 bilaterally, and found no signifi-
cant difference between the groups at the end of the
follow-up (FU) period. In all three studies, the treat-
ment was short in duration and standardised in nature
(using a single point) and, therefore, arguably does
not
reflect
clinical
practice.
Most
acupuncturists
sharing
their experiences
in
a
previous
survey12
reported using more than one point when treating
infantile colic, tailoring each treatment to match the
infant’s current symptoms as reported by the parents.
LI4 and ST36, both considered important in the treat-
ment of gastrointestinal symptoms7 13 and infantile
colic,12 were among the most commonly used trad-
itional acupuncture points. In addition, Sifeng is clas-
sically indicated for impaired digestion in childhood13
and is considered to provide a stronger stimulus while
also being more painful.12
Furthermore, the three previous studies8 10 11 were
conducted in private clinics where parents may have
relied strongly on the intervention. W
e believe that, if
acupuncture is found to be safe and effective in
infants with colic, it should be offered as standard
treatment. In Sweden, this means that acupuncture
would need to be implemented as a part of the public
health care system at child health centres (CHCs), as
only healthcare professionals (such as nurses and phy-
sicians authorised by the National Board of Health
and W
elfare) are allowed to treat children by law.
Therefore, the original aims of this trial were: (1) to
test if acupuncture is effective as a treatment for
infantile colic in a CHC setting; and (2) to compare
the effect of two types of acupuncture against no acu-
puncture in infants with colic at CHCs.
METHODS
Design
W
e
performed
a
multicentre
three-armed
RCT
(ACU-COL) to compare two styles of acupuncture as
an adjunct to gold standard care with gold standard
care alone (no acupuncture) in infants with colic. The
study was conducted at four CHCs in Sweden, which
comprised two centres located close to the second
and third biggest cities in Sweden, and two in smaller
cities. Alongside usual care at their regular CHCs,
recruited infants visited a study CHC twice a week
for 2 weeks. Infants were randomly allocated to one
of three groups: group A received standardised MA at
LI4; group B received semi-standardised individua-
lised acupuncture inspired by TCM; and group C
received no acupuncture. The CHC nurse and the
parents were blinded to group allocation.
Participants
Eligible infants were those who, according to their
parents’
records
in
a
diary,
cried
and/or
fussed
>3 hours/day for >3 days during the baseline week
(BL). In addition to fulfilling these criteria for colic,
infants needed to be between 2 and 8 weeks of age and
otherwise healthy with appropriate weight gain. Before
inclusion they also needed to have tried a diet exclud-
ing cow’s milk protein from breastfeeding mothers
and/or appropriate formula for at least 5 days. The
exclusion
criteria
included
being
born
before
37 weeks’ gestation, taking any kind of prescribed
medication or having previously tried acupuncture.
Acupuncturists’ backgrounds
In total 10 acupuncturists participated in this study,
five of whom performed the absolute majority of the
treatments; the rest were sporadic stand-ins. Nine
were registered nurses and midwives, and one stand-in
was a medical doctor. Nine had undergone extensive
acupuncture training including TCM, while one had
relatively less training. They had been in private acu-
puncture practice for a mean duration of 20 years
(range 1–30 years). Each acupuncturist attended an
education day on acupuncture for colic and study
procedures.
Participant enrolment
Parents seeking help for colic were informed of the
trial by nurses at their ordinary CHC and through a
website. Parents were informed that the trial com-
pared two types of acupuncture versus no acupunc-
ture. Those who wanted to participate contacted the
project leader (KL) and started to register their
infant’s crying in a diary. If the infant fulfilled the cri-
teria for colic (as above), he/she was included.
Data collection
Parents registered the infant’s fussing and crying daily
in a detailed diary during the BL, the first intervention
week (IW1), the second IW (IW2) and the FU period
that concluded with a phone interview 3 days after
completion of IW2 (6 days after the final visit). At the
first visit, the nurse collected informed consent and
background data. At each of the following visits (and
by phone for FU), parents were asked questions about
changes in their infant’s crying, stooling and sleep,
and any side effects they associated with acupuncture.
A more detailed description of the methods is pro-
vided in the study protocol.14 Data were collected
between January 2013 and May 2015.
Usual care
Parallel to the intervention, all infants followed the
national, free-of-charge programme at their regular
172

Original paper
 CHC, which included seven visits during the first
3 months. At these visits, parents received routine
childcare
advice
and
infants
were
weighed
and
measured.
Interventions
Parallel to usual care, study participants visited the
study CHC twice a week for 2 weeks. Thus, all
infants received usual care plus four extra visits to a
CHC,
during
which
parents
met
a
nurse
for
20–30 min and were able to discuss their infant’s
symptoms. Together these were considered to repre-
sent gold standard care. The nurse listened, and gave
evidence-based
advice
and
calming
reassurance.
Breastfeeding mothers were encouraged to continue
breastfeeding. At each visit, the study nurse carried
the infant to a separate treatment room where they
were left alone with the acupuncturist for 5 min. The
acupuncturist treated the baby according to group
allocation and recorded the treatment procedures and
any
adverse
events.
Disposable
stainless
steel
0.20×13 mm Vinco needles (Helio, Jiangsu Province,
China) were used.
Infants allocated to group A received standardised
MA at LI4. One needle was inserted to a depth of
approximately 3 mm unilaterally for 2–5 s and then
withdrawn without stimulation. Infants allocated to
group B received semi-standardised individualised acu-
puncture,
mimicking
clinical
TCM
practice.12
Following a manual, the acupuncturists were able to
choose one point, or any combination of Sifeng, LI4
and ST36, depending on the infant’s symptoms, as
reported in the diary. A maximum of five insertions
were allowed per treatment. Needling at Sifeng con-
sisted of four insertions, each to a depth of approxi-
mately 1 mm for 1 s. At LI4 and ST36, needles were
inserted to a depth of approximately 3 mm, uni- or
bilaterally. Needles could be retained for 30 s. De qi
was not sought, therefore stimulation was similarly
minimal in groups A and B. Infants in group C spent
5 min alone with the acupuncturist without receiving
acupuncture.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the relative difference in
mean values of total crying (TC) time, that is, the
sum of the times spent fussing, crying and colicky
crying, between BL and IW2, recorded in minutes.
The secondary outcome was the number of infants in
each group who continued to fulfil the criteria for
colic at the end of each IW
. Adverse events and the
success
of
parental
blinding
were
additionally
reported.
Sample size
According to a power analysis based on the results of
an earlier trial,11 it was estimated that 192 infants
would be needed to detect a clinically relevant
difference in crying of 30 min/day between the two
acupuncture groups (11% reduction in IW1/IW2 rela-
tive to the BL week). Unfortunately, recruitment to
the trial unexpectedly stopped when acupuncture
became available without randomisation, before such
time as a sufficient number of infants had been
recruited to test the original hypothesis. Accordingly,
a further power calculation was conducted in order to
determine whether a sufficient number of participants
had been recruited to be able to detect a significant
difference between those infants receiving (any) acu-
puncture (groups A and B combined) and those not
receiving acupuncture (group C); the sample size
required was 144 infants (for 80% power) equally dis-
tributed across the groups.
Randomisation
Participants were randomly allocated into one of the
three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio, according to randomisa-
tion lists generated by R&D, Region Skane. As infants
were randomised into two strata (ages 2–5 and
6–9 weeks, respectively), two randomisation lists were
created
for
each
study
centre.
Participants
were
assigned to the three different groups by sampling
without replacement. When the project leader had
included an infant, the project coordinator in charge
of the randomisation was informed. She sent the
study number to the nurse at the study CHC via
email, and also revealed the study number and alloca-
tion to the acupuncturist.
Blinding
Only the project coordinator (who had no contact
with the CHC) and the acupuncturists knew which
group each infant had been randomised to. The nurse
was blinded to group allocation, as were the parents
until they had answered the questions at the end of
the FU period. The acupuncturists had no contact at
all with the parents, and no contact with the nurses
except for a short report when the baby and the diary
were transferred to and from the treatment room.
Blinding was measured by asking the parents four
times if they believed their infant had received acu-
puncture or not.14 If both parents were present and
had differing opinions, the option ‘don’t know’ was
marked.
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were conducted using the data col-
lected in forms and records. Descriptive statistics are
presented as n (%), median [IQR] or median (range).
Differences between groups were assessed by the
Fisher’s exact test, Mann-Whitney U test or the
Kruskal-W
allis H test as appropriate. All data analyses
were performed using the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS) V
.22 for Windows (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Illinois, USA). A two-sided p value ≤0.05
was considered statistically significant.

 Ethical considerations
Conducting research with children always requires
careful ethical reflection, as discussed in the study
protocol.14 All parents received verbal and written
information before signing informed consent. The
Regional Ethical Review Board approved this study
(Dnr 2012/620).
RESULTS
Of 426 infants screened for eligibility, 157 infants ful-
filled the inclusion criteria and were randomised
(figure 1). Of these, 147 infants started the interven-
tion and were treated according to the randomisation
schedule. One hundred and forty-four infants com-
pleted the study period. There were no differences
between groups for background data. Background
data for the included infants are reported in table 1.
There
were
no
significant
differences
between
groups A and B for any of the study’s outcome mea-
sures, consistent with the relative lack of power due to
recruitment
ending
prematurely.
Accordingly,
all
outcome
data
are
additionally
presented
as two
groups (groups A and B combined vs group C) to
reflect the overall effects of acupuncture.
Crying
The effect of the two types of acupuncture was similar
and both groups receiving acupuncture (A and B)
showed improvements over gold standard care alone
(group C). Compared with infants not receiving acu-
puncture, those in the acupuncture groups exhibited a
significant relative reduction in the time spent crying
between BL and IW2 (p=0.05), and in the time spent
colicky crying between BL and FU (p=0.031; table 2).
When the acupuncture groups were merged the same
end points were significant (p=0.021 and 0.031,
respectively). As shown in table 3, when comparing
the absolute differences between the merged groups,
duration
of
colicky
crying
was
reduced
at
FU
(p=0.028) for infants receiving any acupuncture and
TC was reduced at both IW1 and IW2 (p=0.032 and
p=0.020,
respectively).
It
should
be
noted
that
parents of seven infants (four in group A, two in
group B, and one in group C) had recorded all crying
Figure 1
Flow chart of the ACU-COL study. Group A received standardised minimal acupuncture at LI4. Group B received
semi-standardised individualised acupuncture at LI4, ST36 and/or Sifeng. Group C received no acupuncture. All groups also received
gold standard care, which comprised seven routine visits and four extra visits to a community health centre.

 as ‘crying’ without differentiating between ‘fussing’,
‘crying’ or ‘colicky crying’ in the diaries during BL.
After clarification of the instructions, these parents
began to classify crying into those three subcategories
from IW1 onwards. In the absence of baseline data for
these infants, time spent fussing and colicky crying
were considered to represent missing data at IW1,
IW2 and FU (tables 2 and 3).
Table 4 shows the main secondary outcome, namely
the number of infants in each group who continued
to fulfil the criteria for colic at the end of each IW
.
Significantly fewer infants who received acupuncture
continued to cry/fuss excessively at the end of IW1
(p=0.040) and IW2 (p=0.006).
Blinding
On four occasions the parents answered the question
‘Do you think your infant received acupuncture?’ with
‘yes’, ‘no’ or ‘don’t know’. In group C, 21–29% of
the parents guessed correctly (no acupuncture) on all

 four
occasions,
while
the
rest
(71–79%)
either
thought that their infant had received acupuncture or
didn’t know (table 5). The percentage of parents in
merged group A+B who correctly guessed that their
infant had received acupuncture increased from 45%
to 72% between the first and last occasions, while
28–55% were incorrect or didn’t know.
Adverse events
In total, 388 treatments were given. On 200 occasions
the infant did not cry at all, on 157 occasions the
infant cried up to 1 min, and on 31 occasions the
infant cried for >1 min (mean 2.7 min). The acupunc-
turists reported bleeding (a single drop of blood) on
15 occasions. One parent reported seeing a drop of
blood on the infant’s clothes, and one reported seeing
a mark on the infant’s hand. No other adverse events
were reported.
DISCUSSION
In this present study of two types of acupuncture
versus
no
acupuncture,
crying
and
fussing
were
reduced in all groups. This was to be expected, as
colic is a spontaneously healing condition. However,

Original paper
 the magnitude of the reduction in crying was greater,
suggesting a faster recovery, in infants who received
either type of acupuncture compared to gold standard
care alone. Fussing and crying are normal communica-
tions for a baby, therefore a reduction to normal
levels (rather than silence) is the goal of treatment.
Even though the reduction in minutes may seem
modest, significantly more infants who received acu-
puncture cried for <3 hours/day, with significantly
less time spent colicky crying, which is the most
intense form of crying. This reduction in crying is
arguably the difference between having a baby with
colic versus one without, and therefore is clinically
relevant for parents. Thus acupuncture might have a
role in shortening the strenuous period of colic. It
also appeared to be a safe treatment, in the setting of
this RCT
.
Another clinically relevant finding is that, out of
the 426 infants screened for ACU-COL, only 157
were actually found to have persistence of colic after
a 5-day period without cow’s milk. During this time,
a diary was used to measure the duration and inten-
sity of crying, and parents were offered advice and
support by telephone. Thus, the majority of infants
in this cohort did not have colic, even though their
parents
sought
help
for
excessive
crying.
These
cheap, safe and effective interventions may have
helped stressed parents assess the situation in a more
objective way, and thereby have avoided unnecessary
treatment.
Meeting a supportive professional may relieve the
burden of colic for parents.1 Besides usual care, each
family in the ACU-COL study had four extra visits to
a CHC where they met a nurse specialised in paediat-
ric care who asked questions, listened, and gave com-
mendations, advice and hope. Thus we had no
placebo group; group C received gold standard care
only, while groups A and B additionally received acu-
puncture. Acupuncture therapy led to a further reduc-
tion in crying, commensurate with the results of
Reinthal et al8 and Landgren et al.11 The negative
finding of Skjeie et al10 seems to be the outlier, and
may be due to the use of a different acupuncture
point, different treatment interval and/or a non-
validated symptom diary.
It is unknown whether an optimal or adequate dose
of acupuncture was used. In adults, the patient’s own
perception of the needle stimulation, for example, the
de qi sensation, affects the outcome of treatment.15 In
ACU-COL, the acupuncture stimulation was so mild it
could be defined as minimal in both acupuncture
groups; de qi was not sought. Many infants did not
cry or show any motor response to the stimulus, and
sleeping infants rarely woke up. Thus there was prob-
ably a lack of sensory, affective and cognitive percep-
tion, and infants may not therefore have received an
adequate treatment.
Compared
to
TCM
acupuncture
treatments
in
adults, in ACU-COL fewer needles were used, the
treatment time was shorter, and the needle stimulation
followed recommendations to be very mild.12 Yet acu-
puncture showed a significant effect on some vari-
ables, suggesting that MA can have a therapeutic
effect. This finding lends further support to the rec-
ommendation that MA should not be used as a
placebo for research.
Although the numbers are still relatively small,
ACU-COL adds further to our current body of knowl-
edge regarding the safety of treating infants with acu-
puncture. The low frequency of reported adverse
events is in line with earlier reports.16 W
e consider
that any risks were minimised by the use of well-
educated acupuncturists and sterile needles, as well as
the avoidance of acupuncture points on the thorax.
Infants tolerated the treatment fairly well. In 52% of

Original paper
 the treatments (200/388) the infant did not cry at all,
and only 8% of the treatments (31 of 388) triggered
crying that lasted ≥ 1 min. Thus, if the treatment
reduces excessive crying, it may be considered ethic-
ally acceptable.
Strengths and limitations
To increase the internal validity, we used a study
protocol and adhered to the Standards for Reporting
Interventions
in
Clinical
Trials
of
Acupuncture
(STRICTA) guidelines for RCTs of acupuncture.17 W
e
used definitive inclusion criteria, a detailed diary,
adequate randomisation, an appropriate control, suffi-
cient FU, appropriate statistical methods and well-
trained acupuncturists. Furthermore, we had a low
dropout rate. The nurse who met the parents was
blinded and consistently gave the same advice, instil-
ling the same amount of hope for all families.
As the intervention for group B was only semi-
standardised, we have not offered a true TCM treat-
ment. However, the points used are adequate accord-
ing to clinical practice and textbooks.12 A guideline
was developed after consultation with experienced
acupuncturists, following the STRICTA recommenda-
tions.17 It was based on a survey including 23 paediat-
ric acupuncture teachers and experienced practitioners
representing both traditional and W
estern acupuncture
from nine countries.12 As the difference between
sham and verum acupuncture remains unclear, and
acupuncture points and stimulation methods consid-
ered to constitute ‘sham’ might in fact be effective,18
no sham acupuncture group was included.
A definite limitation was our design comparing two
types of MA. Recent studies19 have shown that very
large numbers of patients are needed to detect differ-
ences between two active acupuncture interventions,
which was confirmed by ACU-COL wherein both acu-
puncture groups had a similar effect. An advantage is
that this three-armed study included a group that did
not get acupuncture. Unfortunately we could not
reach the desired number of infants as recruitment
ceased when acupuncture for colic became available at
several clinics without the need for randomisation
during the second year of data collection. To increase
the statistical power, the two acupuncture groups were
merged to evaluate the difference between (any) acu-
puncture and no acupuncture. These calculations,
although post hoc, lend support to a potential thera-
peutic effect for acupuncture in colic.
When doing research on children, the results may
be affected by parents’ expectations, as the parents
interpret and evaluate the child’s symptoms.20 As
parents in ACU-COL were blinded, the research strat-
egy was not to explore the effect of acupuncture prag-
matically as an adjunct to usual care, but rather to
investigate whether acupuncture had an effect when
parental expectancy was controlled for. Thus blinding
was crucial and measured. Parents were unable to
detect marks on their infant’s skin after receiving acu-
puncture in an earlier study11 as well as in the present
trial. Nonetheless, among parents of infants who
received acupuncture, the percentage of those who
believed that the infant had received acupuncture
increased at the later visits. This probably reflects the
fact that infants receiving acupuncture were deriving
greater benefit from treatment.
Infants were not aware of the therapeutic relation-
ship or possible benefits of acupuncture, both import-
ant components of the therapy that may be synergistic
to the needle effect.15 As infants in ACU-COL were
less
influenced
by
the
widely
discussed
placebo
response, the positive results are even more interesting
and add to our knowledge base, since the parents
who carefully documented the infants’ behaviour
24 hours/day were blinded to allocation.
CONCLUSION
Among those initially experiencing excessive infant
crying, the majority of parents reported normal values
once the infant’s crying had been evaluated in a diary
and a diet free of cow’s milk had been introduced.
Therefore,
objective
measurement
of
crying
and
exclusion of cow’s milk protein are recommended as
first steps, to avoid unnecessary treatment. For those
infants that continue to cry >3 hours/day, acupunc-
ture may be an effective treatment option. The two
styles of MA tested in ACU-COL had similar effects;
both reduced crying in infants with colic and had no
serious side effects. However, there is a need for
further research to find the optimal needling loca-
tions, stimulation and treatment intervals.
