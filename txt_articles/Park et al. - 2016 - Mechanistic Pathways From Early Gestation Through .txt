abstract
OBJECTIVE: To identify pathways through which pre- and postnatal factors directly or 
indirectly affect infant neurodevelopment at 12 months of age among Filipino infants.
METHODS: The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, third edition was used to assess the 
development of 314 infants of mothers enrolled in a trial examining the safety and efficacy 
of praziquantel during pregnancy. Maternal covariates included socioeconomic status, 
iron and nutritional status, cognitive performance, and alcohol intake. Infant covariates 
included birth weight and feeding practices, longitudinal growth and nutritional status, 
hemoglobin and iron status captured at birth, and 6 and 12 months of age. Multivariable 
regression and structural equation modeling were used to identify significant factors 
associated with infant development.
RESULTS: In regression models, maternal education, cognition, and iron status as well as 
infant weight-for-age z-score (WAZ), weight-for-length z-score, and WAZ gains were 
significantly associated with infant development at 12 months of age. Structural equation 
modeling demonstrated a direct effect of maternal cognition on most subscales of infant 
development and indirect effects on expressive language through effects on infant WAZ. 
Maternal iron status was a stronger predictor of infant cognition subscale scores than was 
infant iron status. Exclusive breastfeeding had a direct influence on expressive language 
rather than acting through improved infant iron or nutritional status.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified key modifiable risk factors for impaired neurodevelopment, 
including prenatal risk factors such as maternal iron status. Integrated nutritional 
interventions that impact both maternal and infant nutritional status are likely to positively 
affect infant neurodevelopment through identified pathways.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: A longitudinal examination 
of risk factors from early gestation to 12 months of 
age identifi
 ed mechanistic pathways through which 
known (maternal cognition, infant nutrition) and 
newly identifi

By 2005, the World Bank had 
financed $1.7 billion in loans 
to 52 low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) to design early 
child development programs. 
1 
Nevertheless, more than 200 million 
children <5 years of age in LMICs, 
representing approximately one-
third of children living in this context, 
fail to achieve their developmental 
potential. 
2 In separate studies 
that included a broader age range, 
developmental disabilities among 
children aged 2 to 9 years were 
identified in 3% to 48% (median, 
23%) of children in 18 LMICs 
assessed. 
3 Cognitive and behavioral 
development during infancy and 
childhood affects general and 
mental health and well-being in 
adulthood. 
4, 
5 Therefore, identifying 
risk factors, which may begin in 
utero, and understanding pathways 
through which they contribute to 
neurodevelopmental deficits are 
key steps to inform the timing and 
content of interventions.
Cognitive, language, and motor 
development of children at different 
stages can be affected by numerous 
and varying factors. 
6 As these factors 
are often complexly interdependent, 
the use of independent regression 
models is cumbersome. In addition, 
these models may not elucidate 
mechanisms through which early 
factors influence other more 
proximate risk factors, which may 
underestimate their contribution. 
This has important implications for 
the development of interventions, 
as more distal causes and their 
contribution to both proximate 
causes and neurodevelopmental 
outcomes may otherwise be 
underestimated, thus missing 
potential opportunities to intervene. 
Structural equation modeling (SEM) 
is a powerful statistical approach to 
address interdependent relationships 
among multiple variables 
simultaneously, and thus may be 
useful to investigate causal pathways 
associated with infant development 
beginning in early pregnancy.
Although studies have investigated 
postnatal factors influencing infant 
development, few have captured 
key prenatal factors and used SEM 
to understand the mechanistic 
pathways through which these 
factors affect development. 
Further, no studies using SEM 
have been conducted in the LMIC 
context, where iron deficiency, 
undernutrition, decreased 
educational opportunity, and poverty 
are likely to have a profound effect 
on neurodevelopment. The objective 
of this study was to identify risk 
or protective factors that directly 
or indirectly influence infant 
neurodevelopment as captured 
by the Bayley Scales of Infant 
Development, third edition (BSID-
III). We addressed this objective by 
constructing SEM models to examine 
potential mechanisms through which 
measured predictors influence BSID-
III subscale and composite scores.
METHODS
Study Participants
Study subjects were infants of pregnant 
women living in Leyte, the Philippines, 
who were enrolled in a phase 2 
randomized placebo-controlled trial 
to examine the effects of praziquantel 
given at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation 
on pregnancy outcomes. Details of 
the trial are described elsewhere. 
7 
Briefly, 370 pregnant women were 
recruited in their villages or municipal 
health centers by trained midwives. 
To be eligible to participate, women 
had to be infected with Schistosoma 
japonicum; be otherwise healthy 
as determined by history, physical 
examination, and laboratory studies; 
and have a viable, singleton gestation. 
Women were enrolled and randomly 
assigned to the praziquantel or placebo 
groups. The trial captured birth weight 
and health status of 361 newborns. 
Of these, 314 infants had BSID-III 
administered between 332 and 430 
days after birth, and are included 
in this study. Of note, treatment 
with praziquantel did not affect the 
primary outcome, birth weight.
Primary Determinants
Demographic Covariates
Household socioeconomic status (SES) 
was captured in 4 domains determined 
a priori as previously developed 
and validated in this study area: 
educational status, social class position, 
material wealth, and a composite SES 
score by using all questionnaire items. 
8 
Scores for each of these 4 domains 
reflect numeric weights assigned to 
SES questionnaire items, as described 
by Filmer and Pritchett, 
 
9 by using the 
FACTOR procedure in SAS 9.3 (SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary, NC). The primary 
determinant used was the derived 
summary SES variable, a weighted 
combination of all items, which was 
dichotomized. Maternal education 
was also evaluated separately and 
dichotomized as having completed 
high school or not.
Nutritional Covariates
At 12 to 16 weeks of gestation, 
maternal height and weight (model 
BD-585 portable scale; Tanita, 
Arlington Heights, MD) were measured 
to 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg, respectively. 
At 32 weeks’ gestation, maternal 
complete blood count was captured as 
well as iron status by using a multiplex 
bead-based platform (Bio-Rad, 
Hercules, CA) as described previously. 
7 
Iron status was determined by 
quantifying serum Transferrin 
Receptor (sTfR), a receptor 
predominantly expressed by red 
blood cells when they are iron thirsty, 
and ferritin, indicative of stored iron. 
The sTfR: 
log10(ferritin) ratio (sTfR-F 
index) at 32 weeks’ gestation was used 
as the primary measure of maternal 
iron status, as it is thought to be more 
robust in the setting of inflammation 
and has been validated against a gold 
standard of bone marrow iron in a 
setting with high rates of infection 
and inflammation.

Newborn birth weight was measured 
to within 0.01 kg within 48 hours 
of delivery by using a portable 
Tanita digital infant scale. Small-for-
gestational age (SGA), used as an 
indicator for possible intrauterine 
growth restriction, was defined 
based on gestational age determined 
at the 12- to 16-week ultrasound. 
SGA was defined as a birth weight 
below the 10th percentile for 
gestational age based on the sex-
specific curves generated for close to 
1 million healthy Chinese newborns, 
to attenuate genetic contribution 
to SGA. 
11 Prematurity was defined 
as gestation <37 weeks. Low birth 
weight (LBW) was defined as birth 
weight <2.5 kg. Length was measured 
in a recumbent position by using a 
length board stadiometer (Ellard 
Instrumentation Ltd, Monroe, WA). 
Weight-for-age (WAZ), length-for-
age (LAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ) 
z-scores were calculated by using 
the 2006 World Health Organization 
Anthro Growth Standards (www. 
who. 
int/ 
childgrowth/ 
software/ 
en/ 
).
At 1, 6, and 12 months of age, the 
infant was again weighed and 
measured and WAZ, LAZ, and WLZ 
were derived. In addition, sTfR, 
ferritin levels, and sTfR-F index were 
quantified at birth, and 6 and 12 
months of age as described. To assess 
change in nutritional status and linear 
growth, we additionally calculated 
WAZ, LAZ, and WLZ gains per month 
between birth and 12 months.
Maternal Cognitive Function.
Maternal cognition was captured with 
the Philippine Nonverbal Intelligence 
Test (PNIT), which measures concept 
recognition and abstract thinking. 
12 
In our previous studies in the same 
study area, interrater and test-
retest reliability for this test were 
found to be excellent (0.99 and 0.89, 
respectively). 
9 Participants are asked 
to choose which 1 of 5 drawings is 
conceptually different from the other 
4. The score (range, 0–100) was the 
total number of correct responses.
Primary Outcome
Infant cognitive function was assessed 
at 12 months of age with the BSID-III. 
The BSID-III consists of 3 primary 
developmental scales: cognitive, 
language (composed of receptive and 
expressive communication subscales), 
and motor (composed of fine and 
gross motor subscales). The social/
adaptive scales were not evaluated, as 
they were too difficult to adapt to this 
cultural setting. The 5 raw subscales 
were converted to scaled scores by 
age grouping (30-day windows). 
13 
Scaled scores were then used to 
derive the 3 composite BSID scores. 
13
Statistical Analysis
sTfR and ferritin levels and sTfR-F 
index were natural log-transformed 
before regression modeling. If sTfR 
or ferritin were below detection, the 
level of those was recorded as the 
detection limit. As some ferritin levels 
produce negative levels in sTfR-F 
index, integer 1 was added to ferritin 
values before producing sTfR-F index.
Associations between predictors 
and BSID-III subscale scores were 
first evaluated by univariable linear 
regression models. All variables 
listed in  
Table 1, except for BSID-
III test age, were analyzed in the 
statistical modeling. Predictors with 
a P < .2 in the univariable model 
were considered for inclusion 
in multivariable modeling. If >1 
predictor capturing a related 
construct had a P < .2 (eg, ferritin 
levels and sTfR-F index), we 
selected a representative predictor 
that was the most significant. Five 
multivariable linear regression 
models were built, 1 for each of the 
BSID-III subscales, by using forward 
stepwise selection; predictors 
that were significant at P < .05 
were retained. In multivariable 
modeling, the expanded model 
included predictors whose addition 
significantly decreased residual 
deviance. Significant differences of 
model deviance between 2 nested 
models were evaluated based on the 
likelihood ratio test (P < .05). With 
the exception of SEM, all statistical 
analyses were performed by using 
SAS 9.4 software.
SEM was used to examine explanatory 
models for BSID-III subscale scores 
suggested by results of multivariable 
models by using Stata SEM Builder 
(Stata 14.0; StataCorp, College Station, 
TX). SEM provides simultaneous 
estimation of associations among 
variables as well as the estimation of 
individual associations. Therefore, 
SEM may be useful in confirming 
or refuting a theoretical framework 
suggested by multivariable 
modeling and mechanistic pathways 
culminating in a specific outcome.
A simple SEM was initially constructed 
based on the multivariable models 
for 5 BSID-III subscale scores. The 
language and motor subscales 
were evaluated in distinct models 
as we hypothesized that specific 
predictors might differently influence 
these subscales. Each variable in 
multivariable models was iteratively 
considered alone and in combination, 
because many predictors were 
correlated. Predictors that were 
not retained in the multivariable 
models, but were correlated with 
other predictors in the multivariable 
models (Supplemental Table 4) were 
also considered for inclusion in the 
SEM. Finally, BSID-III subscale scores 
were connected to 3 composite scores 
to evaluate the indirect effects of 
predictors on those 3 summary scores. 
The model with appropriate measure 
of fit and theoretical validity was then 
chosen. A good model was considered 
to have relative χ2 (χ2/df) <3 with P > 
.05 of χ2, the root mean square error of 
approximation <0.07, the comparative 
fit index >0.95, and the standardized 
root mean squared residual <0.08.

completed the BSID-III (n = 314) 
were not significantly different from 
noncompleters (n = 47) with respect 
to maternal, delivery, and infant 
characteristics, including maternal 
treatment status, age, parity, education, 
SES, and infants’ sex, birth weight, and 
feeding practices (data not shown). 
The mean maternal age was 26.0 years 
and the mean age at which the BSID-III 
was completed was 369.9 days. A total 
of 88.6% infants were exclusively 
fed breast milk at 12 months of age; 
33.8% and 13.1% of infants were SGA 
and LBW, respectively.
In univariable models for 5 
subscale scores, maternal education 
and PNIT scores were the most 
significant predictors across the 
subscales (Supplemental Table 5). In 
multivariable models, higher maternal 
PNIT score significantly increased all 
subscale scores with the exception 
of receptive language ( 
Table 2). The 
cognitive subscale was additionally 
associated with maternal sTfR-F 
index; expressive language with 
exclusive breastfeeding and WAZ at 
12 months; fine motor with maternal 
randomization to the praziquantel 
arm; and gross motor with WLZ at 12 
months. Higher receptive language 
scores were associated with maternal 
education and higher infant WLZ at 12 
months of age.
Our SEM model represents a set of 
theoretical causal pathways based 
on regression modeling by using 
observed predictors ( 
Fig 1). Direct, 
indirect, and total relationships may 
be inferred from SEM models ( 
Fig 1). 
For example, a higher maternal PNIT 
score directly increased the gross 
motor score (β = 0.013, P = .006), and 
the higher PNIT score increased the 
gross motor score through indirect 
effects on maternal and infant 
nutritional status. Accordingly, the 
gross motor subscale score increased 
by approximately 0.013 for every 
1-point increase in maternal PNIT 
score (β = 0.013, P = .005;  
Table 3). 
Of note, in SEM models without the 
PNIT score, maternal education was

significantly and directly related 
to both language subscales, as well 
as the cognitive and fine motor 
subscales (data not shown).
Interestingly, maternal iron status at 
32 weeks (sTfR-F index) was more 
strongly related to the cognitive 
subscale than was the infant’s own 
measures of iron status. With respect 
to exclusive breastfeeding, there was 
a strong direct effect on expressive 
language, but not other subscales. 
Importantly, this was a direct 
effect rather than an indirect effect 
through improved infant iron status 
or nutritional status, as has been 
hypothesized. The effect of WAZ at 
birth acted indirectly through WAZ at 
12 months of age to affect expressive 
language, implying that catch-up 
growth may allow improvement in 
expressive language that might not 
occur among smaller newborns who 
do not experience catch-up growth, 
as is the case in many resource-
poor settings. 
15 
 
– 
18 This was further 
supported by the indirect effect of 
monthly WAZ gains on both language 
and gross motor subscales.
DISCUSSION
Our study examined the roles of pre- 
and postnatal maternal and infant 
determinants of neurodevelopment, 
including pathways through which 
these may act in the LMIC context. 
Importantly, developmental subscales 
were differentially affected by a variety 
of pre- and postnatal factors, which one 
would expect based on the importance 
of both the timing of specific insults 
and mechanisms through which they 
act on different cognitive processes. 
SEMs allowed us to explain the 
contributions of those predictors on 
neurodevelopment, while elucidating 
potential mechanisms through which 
pre- and postnatal predictors may 
affect a range of cognitive domains. 
Importantly, this allows identification 
of potentially modifiable pre- and 
postnatal risk factors that may 
continue to place infants at risk for 
cognitive impairment.
Our study identified maternal PNIT 
score as one of the most important

“intelligence” test, this covariate likely 
also captures educational experience. 
This is supported by education’s direct 
effect on PNIT scores. Also of note, we 
identified indirect effects of maternal 
PNIT scores on expressive language and 
motor development subscales through 
both maternal and infant nutritional 
status. A few studies in industrialized 
nations have attempted to identify 
both pre- and postnatal factors, 
including maternal education and IQ, 
influencing neurodevelopment. 
19 
– 
21 
In an Italian birth cohort using SEM, 
both SES and home environment were 
key mediators of the effect of maternal 
IQ on BSID-III cognition and language 
scores, with the effect of IQ “lost” after 
considering these covariates. 
19 In 
many studies not using SEM, maternal 
IQ was a strong independent predictor 
of neurodevelopment.20, 
 
21 Some of 
these studies also note the correlation 
between maternal IQ and other key 
predictors of neurodevelopment, 
such as home environment. 
19, 
 
21, 
 
22 
Importantly, evaluation of many 
potential distal and proximal risk 
factors and the use of SEM allowed us 
to identify both the direct and indirect 
pathways through which maternal 
cognition affects neurodevelopment.
We further found that infant 
nutritional status most significantly 
affected BSID-III language and motor 
subscales. Specifically, there was a 
direct effect of WAZ at 12 months 
of age on expressive language and 
a direct effect of WLZ, a measure of 
wasting, on gross motor development. 
This is in agreement with cross-
sectional studies that have found an 
adjusted relationship between WLZ 
and gross motor development. 
23 
– 
25 
In addition, we specifically examined 
gains in nutritional z-scores given 
the importance of linear growth and 
improved WLZ in modifying risk 
for neurodevelopmental delays. 
23 
Greater gains in WAZ culminating in 
higher WAZ and WLZ, directly affected 
the aforementioned subscales,

highlighting the importance of infant 
catch-up growth as a potential buffer. 
Longitudinal data and SEM allowed 
us to identify the indirect effect of 
maternal BMI on these subscales 
through its impact of WAZ at birth, 
highlighting the distal, yet persistent, 
role that maternal nutritional status 
has on infant neurodevelopment.
Interestingly, our results found 
that infants who were exclusively 
breastfed at 12 months demonstrated 
higher BSID-III score for only the 
expressive language subscale. Although 
we evaluated indirect effects through 
which breastfeeding might affect 
neurodevelopment, such as infant 
nutritional status and iron nutriture, 
the effect was better explained as 
direct in SEMs. Similarly, in a group 
of Asian toddlers, increased exposure 
to breastfeeding was associated 
with higher scores on tests of both 
expressive and receptive language, 
 
26 
and higher BSID-III scores on all 
subscales except gross motor among 
Greek toddlers. 
27 Differences in 
affected subscales by feeding practices 
among studies may be due to the 
differences in defining practices, timing 
of neurodevelopmental testing, as 
well as analytic approach. Specifically, 
many studies have failed to adjust 
for potential confounders, such as 
SES, which may overattribute the 
effect of feeding practices. 
28 An SEM 
approach both allows adjustment for 
confounders, which may explain lack 
of effect on nonlanguage subscales 
in this study, as well as capture of 
mechanistic pathways, which may 
lead to “dropping” out of covariates. 
The direct effect of breastfeeding on 
expressive language may be attributed 
to the shared network of brain regions 
controlling speech and swallowing, 
 
29 
as well as a hypothesized effect of 
emotional bonding and greater physical 
proximity during breastfeeding.
In our SEM model, we found a direct 
effect of maternal iron status at 32 
weeks’ gestation on the BSID-III 
cognition subscale. Interestingly, we 
did not observe direct or indirect 
effects of the infant’s own iron 
status at 6 or 12 months of age on 
cognition. During human pregnancy, 
maternal iron deficiency poses a 
significant threat to fetal iron, which 
may decrease the iron concentration 
of the rapidly growing fetal and 
neonatal brain. 
30 In rodent models, 
this culminates in iron-dependent 
changes in neurometabolism and 
neuroanatomy during late gestation 
and the neonatal period, many of which 
are not reversible. 
31 
– 
33 A recent study 
conducted in China demonstrated 
that iron deficiency anemia in 
the third trimester significantly 
reduced neurodevelopment at 12, 
18, and 24 months of age and this 
could be corrected by adequate 
supplementation even if the woman’s 
anemia was not fully resolved.34
This study has some limitations that 
should be noted. First, our measure 
of maternal cognitive function, the 
PNIT score, likely captures both IQ and 
aspects of educational opportunity. 
It is therefore difficult to assess how 
modifiable this construct is, although 
the direct effect of educational status 
on PNIT score and neurodevelopment 
suggests this may be a modifiable risk 
factor. Another limitation relates to 
the selection of primary predictors 
in SEM; when conducting the same 
analyses (n = 314) without PNIT 
score, some maternal characteristics, 
such as maternal education and SES, 
were additionally included in the 
multivariable and SEM models, again 
suggesting this covariate may be a proxy 
for the broader context of poverty. 
With respect to the generalizability 
of our findings, we would expect that 
the relationships among risk factors, 
pathways, and neurodevelopment 
would be generalizable to other 
populations, although the attributable 
risk due to exposures such as maternal 
iron deficiency that occur at higher 
frequency in LMICs, may differ from 
industrialized nations. Finally, the PNIT 
was originally developed to measure the 
intelligence of Filipino children; lack of a 
“ceiling effect” during testing, however, 
suggests that we were able to capture 
a full range of cognitive function.

CONCLUSIONS
The longitudinal design of this study 
beginning in early gestation allowed 
the evaluation of both distal and 
proximal risk factors contributing to 
neurodevelopment. We identified key 
risk factors and pathways influencing 
this construct. Importantly, many of 
these are at least partially modifiable, 
including maternal cognitive function, 
which was strongly influenced 
by educational status, exclusive 
breastfeeding, infant nutritional 
status at 12 months of age, and 
maternal iron status. The influence 
of key maternal factors, such as iron 
status, and maternal BMI acting 
through infant WAZ, highlights the 
importance of maternal health and 
nutritional status on the longitudinal 
development of their infants. The 
protective effect of infant catch-up 
growth as well as the direct effect 
of exclusive breastfeeding provides 
further support for continued efforts 
to improve infant nutritional status 
and promote exclusive breastfeeding.
