Abstract
Background: Integrated molecular pathology (IMP) approaches based on DNA mutational profiling accurately
determine pancreatic cyst malignancy risk in patients lacking definitive diagnoses following endoscopic ultrasound
imaging with fine-needle aspiration of fluid for cytology. In such cases, IMP ‘low-risk’ and ‘high-risk’ diagnoses reliably
predict benign and malignant disease, respectively, and provide improved risk stratification for malignancy than a
model of the 2012 International Consensus Guideline (ICG) recommendations. Our objective was to determine if initial
adjunctive IMP testing influenced future real-world pancreatic cyst management decisions for intervention or
surveillance relative to ICG recommendations, and if this benefitted patient outcomes.
Methods: Analysis of data from the previously described National Pancreatic Cyst Registry. Associations between
real-world decisions (intervention vs. surveillance), ICG model recommendations (surgery vs. surveillance) and IMP
diagnoses (high-risk vs. low-risk) were evaluated using 2 × 2 tables. Kaplan Meier and hazard ratio analyses were used
to assess time to malignancy. Odds ratios (OR) for surgery decision were determined using logistic regression.
Results: Of 491 patients, 206 received clinical intervention at follow-up (183 surgery, 4 chemotherapy, 19 presumed
by malignant cytology). Overall, 13 % (66/491) of patients had a malignant outcome and 87 % (425/491) had a benign
outcome at 2.9 years’ follow-up. When ICG and IMP were concordant for surveillance/surgery recommendations, 83 %
and 88 % actually underwent surveillance or surgery, respectively. However, when discordant, IMP diagnoses were
predictive of real-world decisions, with 88 % of patients having an intervention when ICG recommended surveillance
but IMP indicated high risk, and 55 % undergoing surveillance when ICG recommended surgery but IMP indicated low
risk. These IMP-associated management decisions benefitted patient outcomes in these subgroups, as 57 % had
malignant and 99 % had benign outcomes at a median 2.9 years’ follow-up. IMP was also more predictive of real-world
decisions than ICG by multivariate analysis: OR 11.4 (95 % CI 6.0 − 23.7) versus 3.7 (2.4 − 5.8), respectively.
Conclusions: DNA-based IMP diagnoses were predictive of real-world management decisions. Importantly, when ICG
and IMP were discordant, IMP influence benefitted patients by increasing confidence in surveillance and surgery
decisions and reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries in patients with benign disease.

 Background
Although pancreatic cystic lesions carry an increased over-
all risk for malignancy, the majority have a benign course,
with an estimated malignant transformation rate of 0.4 %
per year in cysts that are non-malignant at diagnosis [1, 2].
International and European groups have published consen-
sus recommendations for pancreatic cyst management
based on first-line test results (cytology, imaging, fluid
chemistry) [3, 4], although recommendations are based
mainly on specific cyst histology, which is frequently indis-
cernible without surgery [5]. An evidence-based approach
was recently proposed by the American Gastroenterological
Association, although the authors noted that the available
evidence was of very low quality [5, 6]. Cytological analysis
of samples collected by endoscopic ultrasound with fine-
needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has a high true positive rate
for presence of malignancy (specificity 90–100 %) but a low
true negative rate (sensitivity < ~40 %), and is often indeter-
minate [3, 7–10]. Given the poor survival rate for pancre-
atic carcinoma [11], management is often cautious, with
many patients undergoing surgery, although only a minor-
ity have malignant cysts on surgical pathology [12–16]. A
recent estimate derived from a pooled analysis of published
literature indicated an invasive adenocarcinoma frequency
of 15 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 12–18 %) in patients
with any type of pancreatic cyst undergoing surgery
[5]. Thus, there is a need for a diagnostic approach
that can reliably distinguish cysts that are malignant
or likely to become malignant from those that will
remain benign, in order to better ascertain which pa-
tients require surgery.
The widely-used Sendai 2012 International Consensus
Guideline (ICG) recommendations [3] are based on
traditional imaging, cytology and fluid chemistry criteria.
Studies based on actual patient outcomes show that the
ICG criteria for surgery versus surveillance have high
sensitivity for malignancy but a high false positive rate;
thus a substantial number of patients undergo unneces-
sary surgery [17–19]. Recent estimates of mortality and
morbidity
associated
with
pancreatic
cyst
resection
based on a pooled literature analysis indicate that sur-
gery is not without harm, even when conducted in spe-
cialized centers; the overall morbidity rate was 30 %
(95 % CI, 25–35 %) and the mortality rate of 2.1 % (95 %
CI, 1.5–2.7 %) was noted as a likely underestimation [5].
DNA mutational analysis of cyst fluid has identified
features that correlate with malignancy, although they
do not reliably predict malignancy risk when assessed
individually [20]. Integrated molecular pathology (IMP)
interrogates a panel of mutational changes in DNA
(loss of heterozygosity mutations at 10 genomic loci,
oncogene point mutation, DNA quantity) in the con-
text of traditional first-line test results (cytology, fluid
chemistry, imaging) to determine risk of malignancy
[17, 21], and is intended to be used as an adjunct to
first-line testing in patients who are indeterminate for
malignancy following EUS imaging and FNA of pancre-
atic cyst/duct fluid for cytology. The performance of
IMP in determining malignancy risk was assessed in
the National Pancreatic Cyst Registry study, which
reviewed follow-up medical records of patients who
had an IMP test as a component of their real-world
care, and showed that the IMP diagnostic categories of
‘benign (BEN)’ and ‘statistically indolent (SI)’ reliably
predicted benign outcomes and ‘statistically higher risk
(SHR)’ and ‘aggressive (AGG)’ reliably predicted malig-
nant outcomes [17]. Compared with a model of the
ICG criteria, IMP diagnoses increased the accuracy of
surgery versus surveillance recommendations. IMP cor-
rectly recommended surveillance in 84 % of patients
with benign outcomes for whom surgery was recom-
mended based on ICG criteria, and also confirmed that
ICG recommendations for surveillance were appropri-
ate in 98 % of patients (benign outcomes) [17]. IMP
recommended surgery in four of six patients with ma-
lignancies that were missed by ICG criteria (i.e. lacking
‘worrisome’ features) [17]. The use of IMP testing as an
adjunct to guideline-recommended criteria may help
limit false negatives and increase confidence that sur-
veillance at longer intervals is appropriate in most pa-
tients [17, 22].
Because IMP is associated with a per-patient cost that
is greater than that of first-line tests alone, the economic
utility of IMP has been assessed in order to determine
its overall cost effectiveness. Using a Markov decision
model with a third-party-payer perspective to compare
management strategies, which included resecting only
mucinous cysts based on guideline-recommended first-
line testing alone or resecting only cysts with an AGG
IMP diagnosis, Das et al. found that an IMP-guided
management strategy was the most cost-effective ap-
proach that provided the greatest increase in quality-
adjusted life years to patients by limiting the number of
surgeries on patients with benign disease course while
accurately diagnosing malignant disease [23].
The objective of this analysis was to determine if the
adjunctive use of DNA-based IMP testing in the initial
clinical diagnosis of cystic lesions influenced real-world
pancreatic cyst management decisions at follow-up rela-
tive to the initial ICG recommendations alone, and if so,
whether the changes were of benefit to patients with re-
spect to their outcome (i.e. reduction in unnecessary
surgery). We analyzed data from the National Pancreatic
Cyst Registry cohort to determine the association be-
tween real-world physician decision for clinical interven-
tion (i.e. surgery or chemotherapy), or surveillance and
recommendations based on initial IMP diagnoses or a
model of the traditional ICG criteria.

 Methods
Study design and patient population
This was an analysis of data from the previously
described National Pancreatic Cyst Registry, which in-
cluded adults who underwent EUS-FNA of a pancreatic
cyst and had negative, non-diagnostic, indeterminate or
acellular EUS-FNA cytology results. In these patients,
IMP was performed as a part of clinical testing per the
prescribing physician’s standard of care [17]. After initial
IMP testing, all available clinical data pertaining to the
pancreatic lesion were abstracted from medical records
into a database in a standardized manner, without
additional interpretation. Ethical approval was obtained
at each site as previously described with approval for
continued data analysis described here maintained by
the central IRB (Quorum Review IRB) [17].
IMP diagnosis (PancraGen™ using PathFinder®, Interpace
Diagnostics Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was made
according to standard operating procedures at Interpace
prior to inclusion of patient information into the registry,
and thus without knowledge of the patient’s actual clinical
outcome. Molecular analysis was performed as described
previously [17, 20, 21]. In brief, quantitative molecular
pathology parameters included DNA quantity/quality,
presence of oncogene (KRAS) point mutation and extent
of clonal expansion, and presence of tumor suppressor
gene loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and extent of clonal ex-
pansion, as determined by allelic imbalance. The following
chromosomal loci were examined for LOH (associated
genes in parentheses): 1p (CMM1, L-myc), 3p (VHL,
HoGG1), 5q (MCC, APC), 9p (CDKN2A), 10q (PTEN,
MXI1), 17p (TP53), 17q (NME1), 18q (DCC), 21q (TFF1
and PSEN2), and 22q (NF2). The method for determining
the presence and clonal expansion of oncogene point mu-
tations and LOH mutations has been described previously
[20, 24]. IMP integration of first-line test results (cytology,
fluid chemistry, imaging) with these molecular parameters
has been described elsewhere [17].
Patient outcomes at follow-up were determined as de-
scribed previously [17]. Benign outcomes included benign
or low/intermediate-grade dysplasia on surgical pathology,
cyst resolution on repeat imaging, or follow-up of more
than 23 months without evidence of malignancy. Malig-
nant outcomes were malignant cytology results (unknown
during IMP diagnosis), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), or
clinically confirmed pancreatic cancer.
Definitions of clinical intervention and surveillance
decisions
Real-world decisions were defined as clinical ‘intervention’
if
any
of
the
following
outcomes
occurred
within
12 months of the index EUS-FNA: surgical report and/or
surgical pathology, chemotherapy, or positive cytology. If
none of the above ‘intervention’ conditions were met, the
real-world decision was determined to be ‘surveillance’.
For IMP, diagnoses of SHR and AGG were categorized as
‘high-risk’
, with BEN and SI being categorized as ‘low-risk’.
The ICG criteria model has been described in detail previ-
ously [17]: if there were no high-risk stigmata or worri-
some features then cases were classed as a ‘surveillance
recommendation’; all other cases were classed a ‘surgery
recommendation’.
Statistical analysis
Associations of IMP diagnoses (high-risk vs. low-risk)
and ICG recommendations (surgery vs. surveillance)
with real-world decisions (intervention vs. surveillance)
and actual patient outcomes (benign vs. malignant) were
evaluated using 2 × 2 tables. Univariate and multivariate
logistic regression models were used to determine the
odds ratio (OR) for surgery decision and for malignancy;
the 95 % CI was estimated using the profile-likelihood
method. Kaplan − Meier analysis was used to determine
time to malignant event, with probability of benign out-
come after IMP test shown, and the hazard ratio (HR)
for risk of malignancy calculated using a multivariate
Cox proportional hazards model.
Results and Discussion
This cohort comprised 492 patients who had cystic lesions
indeterminate for malignancy, for whom further informa-
tion has been reported previously [17]. Overall, 491
patients were included in this analysis; one patient whose
outcome was death due to pancreatic cancer was excluded
from the analysis due to lack of clear evidence for surveil-
lance or surgical intervention at follow-up. Overall 19 %
(66/491) of patients had malignant outcome and 87 %
(425/491) of patients had benign outcome at follow-up.
Median follow-up time for patients who underwent
surveillance post initial EUS-FNA (n = 285) was 2.9 years
(range, 1.9 − 7.7 years).
In total, 42 % (206/491) of patients received a clinical
intervention less than 1 year after initial EUS-FNA
(Table 1). Although we refer here to real-world ‘interven-
tion’ decisions, the majority of these were surgery deci-
sions, as 183 patients (89 %) had definitive reports of
surgery in their records. Of the remaining cases, four
(2 %) received chemotherapy and 19 (9 %) had presumed
intervention (e.g. surgery or chemotherapy) due to frankly

 malignant cytology results recorded at follow-up. Thus,
up to 98 % of patients in this cohort had surgery, depend-
ing on the proportion of patients with malignant cytology
undergoing surgery. It seems logical to suppose that sur-
gery would be the goal in all of these ‘intervention’ cases
but may not proceed in patients who are unfit for or de-
cline surgery, and thus receive chemotherapy instead.
A comparison of real-world decisions with IMP and
ICG model recommendations is shown in Table 1. The
real-world decisions at follow-up were approximately
half-way between the initial ICG recommendations and
IMP diagnoses, with IMP recommending the lowest pro-
portion of patients for intervention.
Ideally, there should be a close correlation between cases
with malignant outcomes at follow-up and cases recom-
mended for intervention because they are initially deemed
high risk by diagnostic testing. Similarly, there should be a
close correlation between cases with benign outcomes and
cases recommended for surveillance because they are ini-
tially deemed low risk by diagnostic testing. The actual
proportions of patients in this cohort with malignant and
benign outcomes were 13 % (66/491) and 87 % (425/491),
respectively, which closely reflect those with initial IMP
high-risk diagnoses who were recommended for interven-
tion (19 %) and those with initial low-risk IMP diagnoses
who were recommended for surveillance (81 %), respect-
ively (Table 1).
When surveillance was indicated by both ICG recom-
mendations and IMP low-risk diagnoses, 83 % of patients
actually underwent surveillance, which was the appropri-
ate decision in the large majority as 99 % of this group
(161/162) had benign outcomes (Table 2). Kaplan − Meier
analysis confirmed high probability of benign disease at
follow-up in these patients (Fig. 1; black line). When
intervention was indicated by both ICG and IMP, 88 % of
patients actually underwent intervention within 1 year of
IMP testing, with the majority of patients benefiting as
66 % (50/76) had malignant outcomes (Table 2). Kaplan −
Meier analysis confirmed low probability of benign disease
at follow-up in these patients (Fig. 1; red line).
However, when ICG diagnoses and IMP recommenda-
tions were discordant, real-world clinical intervention
and surveillance decisions at follow-up were more
reflective of initial IMP diagnoses than initial ICG cri-
teria recommendations. Patients were more likely to
undergo intervention when IMP diagnoses indicated
high risk and more likely to undergo surveillance when
IMP diagnoses indicated low risk. When the ICG recom-
mendation was surveillance but IMP diagnosis indicated
high risk, 88 % of patients actually had an intervention
within 1 year of IMP testing, suggesting that IMP influ-
enced the decision for intervention (Table 2). This deci-
sion was of benefit to the majority of these patients, as
57 % had malignant outcomes (Table 2). Kaplan − Meier
analysis confirmed that IMP high-risk diagnoses reliably
predicted the need for intervention even when ICG
criteria recommended surveillance: conditional HR for
malignancy = 29.5; p < 0.0001 (Fig. 1; green vs. black
line). IMP can therefore provide evidence for interven-
tion need in cases where ICG criteria falsely indicate
that surveillance is appropriate. Furthermore, when ICG
recommended surgery but IMP diagnosis indicated low
risk, 55 % of patients underwent surveillance in real-life,
suggesting that IMP facilitated more liberal surveillance
decisions, which was of benefit to the vast majority of
these patients as 99 % had benign outcomes at a median
of ~3 years’ follow-up (Table 2). ICG did not predict the
need for intervention in cases where IMP indicated low
risk; conditional HR for malignancy = 2.3; p = 0.08 (Fig. 1;
blue vs. black line).
When applied to management decisions for pancreatic
cysts, IMP increases the confidence in surveillance deci-
sions where ICG criteria frequently incorrectly indicate a
need for intervention. A reduction in the number of
unnecessary surgeries is a key aim of improving pancre-
atic cyst management, given the surgical morbidity risk,
and particularly the mortality risk of ~2 % at even the
most specialized academic institutions [5]. Thus, the
information provided by the adjunctive use of IMP
allows physicians to make better-informed decisions that
ultimately benefit the health of their patients by more
accurately balancing the mortality of pancreatic cancer
with the risks of surgical resection.
While it is clear that adjuvant IMP diagnoses can pro-
vide a more complete picture of risk for malignancy than
guideline criteria alone, and that the test can influence

 follow-up surveillance and intervention decisions for pa-
tients, the real-world intervention rate was higher than
that recommended by IMP in this cohort, although it
remained lower than that recommended by ICG (Table 1).
Physician clinical judgment and patient preferences play a
critical role in decision making, and these factors could
account for the discrepancy between the objective data
derived from IMP or ICG and the decision to proceed to
surgery. Additional clinical circumstances of the patient
(e.g. suspicious clinical history or comorbidities, or pres-
ence of known risk factors for pancreatic cancer) are likely
to influence this judgment and preference, as patients with
pancreatic cysts in the real world are managed on a case-
by-case basis.
Univariate analysis confirmed that initial IMP diagnoses
were more predictive of actual decisions for intervention
and surveillance than ICG recommendations (OR = 16.8
[95 % CI 9.0 − 34.4] for IMP vs. 5.6 [3.7 − 8.5] for ICG),
and this remained so after adjusting for ICG criteria in a
multivariate analysis (Table 3), showing that initial IMP
diagnoses were significantly predictive of real-world deci-
sions at follow-up. IMP diagnoses were also highly
predictive of actual benign and malignant patient out-
comes by univariate analysis, more than traditional clinical
criteria (OR = 47.4 for IMP vs. 8.5 for ICG; both p <
0.0001), an association that remained highly significant for
IMP after controlling for ICG recommendations in a
multivariate analysis (adjusted OR = 35.8, p < 0.0001 for
IMP vs. 2.5, p = 0.066 for ICG).
We also performed an analysis to determine if the mo-
lecular criteria that are unique to the IMP test (KRAS
mutation, DNA quantity, loss of heterozygosity muta-
tions) [17] were associated with real-world decisions for
intervention and surveillance. There was a clear trend
towards an association between real-world decisions for
intervention in patients and high levels of each of these
molecular parameters. Univariate logistic regression in-
dicated that a combination of any 2 of these high risk
molecular criteria incorporated into an IMP high-risk
diagnosis was associated with real-world decisions for
intervention in patients (p = 0.048). These findings sug-
gest that it is this molecular component of IMP that
produces the strong association between future real-
world decisions and initial IMP diagnoses.

 As discussed elsewhere, a limitation of this analysis is
that the outcomes data were obtained via review of medical
records from patients previously tested by IMP [17]. How-
ever, due to the benign nature of the majority of pancreatic
cysts, this approach is currently the only practical method
of conducting studies to assess pancreatic cyst outcomes in
clinical practice. There are some minor differences be-
tween our ICG model and the published criteria, reflecting
the patient cohort (those who have undergone EUS-FNA
and have been prescribed IMP testing for indeterminate
cystic lesions) and the study design (real-world medical
record review); however, accounting for these differences
were shown to have minimal impact on the performance
of the ICG model in our study and no impact on the
overall conclusions of the study [25].
Conclusion
In this cohort of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions
indeterminate for malignancy by EUS-FNA, real-world
intervention and surveillance decisions were highly associ-
ated with the initial DNA-based IMP diagnostic recom-
mendations. Initial IMP diagnoses were more predictive of
future, real-world patient management decisions and more
beneficial to overall patient outcomes than solely relying on
traditional EUS-FNA criteria recommended by ICG. When
used as an adjuvant to traditional EUS-FNA testing, IMP
increases physician confidence in the decision to proceed
with surgery and reduces the number of unnecessary sur-
geries performed for benign disease.
