Introduction
Psilocybin is a naturally occurring plant alkaloid 
found in the Psilocybe genus of mushrooms. Psilocybe 
mushrooms have been used for millennia for healing 
purposes, but were only discovered by modern science 
in the late 1950s.1,2 Psilocybin is a prodrug of psilocin 
(4-hydroxy-dimethyltryptamine), a serotonin receptor 
agonist and classic psychedelic drug whose principal 
psychoactive eff
 ects are mediated by serotonin 2A 
(5-HT2A) receptor agonism.3 Psilocybin therefore has a 
novel pharmacology in the context of currently available 
antidepressant medications, because selective serotonin-
reuptake inhibitors are not direct 5-HT2A receptor 
agonists.
Enhanced cognitive fl
 exibility,4 associative learning,5 
cortical neural plasticity,6 and antidepressant responses 
have been reported with 5-HT2A receptor agonism in 
animals,7 and increased and sustained improvements in 
wellbeing8 and optimism9 have been observed after 
psychedelic experiences in human beings. Findings 
from human imaging studies with psilocybin have 
supplemented these discoveries, showing changes in 
brain activity suggestive of antidepressant potential; for 
example, a range of eff
 ective antidepressant treatments 
have been found to normalise hyperactivity in the 
medial prefrontal cortex and we found reduced blood 
fl
 ow in this region with intravenous psilocybin.10 
Moreover, data obtained from large-scale population 
studies have recently challenged the view that 
psychedelics negatively aff
 ect mental health,11–13 with one 
study’s fi
 ndings showing lower rates of psychological 
distress and suicidality among people who had used 
Psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant 
depression: an open-label feasibility study

Summary
Background Psilocybin is a serotonin receptor agonist that occurs naturally in some mushroom species. Recent 
studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for various conditions, including end-of-life anxiety, 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and smoking and alcohol dependence, with promising preliminary results. Here, we 
aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and effi
  cacy of psilocybin in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant 
depression.
Methods In this open-label feasibility trial, 12 patients (six men, six women) with moderate-to-severe, unipolar, 
treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a 
supportive setting. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after each 
session. The primary outcome measure for feasibility was patient-reported intensity of psilocybin’s eff
 ects. Patients 
were monitored for adverse reactions during the dosing sessions and subsequent clinic and remote follow-up. 
Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 
16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary effi
  cacy outcome. This trial is 
registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14426797.
Findings Psilocybin’s acute psychedelic eff
 ects typically became detectable 30–60 min after dosing, peaked 2–3 h 
after dosing, and subsided to negligible levels at least 6 h after dosing. Mean self-rated intensity (on a 0–1 scale) 
was 0·51 (SD 0·36) for the low-dose session and 0·75 (SD 0·27) for the high-dose session. Psilocybin was well 
tolerated by all of the patients, and no serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The adverse reactions we 
noted were transient anxiety during drug onset (all patients), transient confusion or thought disorder (nine patients), 
mild and transient nausea (four patients), and transient headache (four patients). Relative to baseline, depressive 
symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS diff
 erence –11·8, 95% CI –9·15 to –14·35, p=0·002, Hedges’ 
g=3·1) and 3 months (–9·2, 95% CI –5·69 to –12·71, p=0·003, Hedges’ g=2) after high-dose treatment. Marked and 
sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also noted.
Interpretation This study provides preliminary support for the safety and effi
  cacy of psilocybin for treatment-resistant 
depression and motivates further trials, with more rigorous designs, to better examine the therapeutic potential of 
this approach.

psychedelics within their lifetime than among those 
who used no psychedelics but an equivalent amount of 
other drugs.11 In modern trials, psychedelics have been 
found to reduce anxious,14,15 depressive,15,16 and obsessive-
compulsive 
symptoms,17 
as 
well 
as 
addictive 
behaviours,18,19 often for several months after just one or 
two exposures. Extensive historical and modern 
evidence now supports the view that, administered in a 
controlled environment with appropriate support, 
psychedelics have a favourable safety profi
 le.20
Depression is a major public health problem; it is a 
leading contributor to the global burden of disease, 
aff
 ecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and 
costing the USA alone more than US$200 billion each 
year.21 Antidepressant medications and cognitive behav-
ioural therapy can be eff
 ective for some patients, but 
around 20% do not respond to any intervention, and many 
of those who do respond, eventually relapse.22 We aimed to 
investigate the safety and feasibility of psilocybin in 
patients with treatment-resistant depression, and to 
establish an initial impression of its effi
  cacy. We postulated 
that the treatment would be well tolerated and depressive 
symptoms would be substantially reduced from baseline at 
all assessment points, for up to 3 months after treatment.
Methods
Study design and participants
This was an open-label feasibility study in patients with 
treatment-resistant depression; there was no control 
group. Patients, invest 
igators, raters, and statisticians 
were not masked to treatment assignment, and all 
participants received the study intervention (psilocybin 
administered in two dosing sessions; an initial safety 
[low] dose and a subsequent treatment [high] dose). The 
inclusion criteria were major depression of a moderate to 
severe degree (17+ on the 21-item Hamilton Depression 
Rating scale [HAM-D]), and no improvement despite two 
adequate courses of antidepressant treatment of diff
 erent 
pharmacological classes lasting at least 6 weeks within 
the current depressive episode.23 Exclusion criteria were: 
current or previously diagnosed psychotic disorder; 
immediate family member with a diagnosed psychotic 
disorder; medically signifi
 cant condition rendering 
unsuitability for the study; history of serious suicide 
attempts (requiring hospitalisation); history of mania; 
blood or needle phobia; positive pregnancy test at 
screening or during the study; and current drug or 
alcohol dependence.
Information about the study’s recruitment was sent to 
general practitioners via the North West London Clinical 
Research Network. However, patients were also allowed 
to self-refer to the study if they were UK residents. In 
every case, patients initiated contact with the research 
team (via email, letter, or telephone), were sent a study 
information sheet, and a subsequent telephone screening 
was arranged, during which the lead psychiatrist on the 
trial (MBo) obtained information about the patient’s 
demographics, medical and psychiatric history, and other 
key inclusion or exclusion criteria. The patient’s 
general practitioner or psychiatrist provided written 
documentation of the patient’s diagnosis and mental 
health background in every case.
This trial received a favourable opinion from the 
National Research Ethics Service London—West London, 
was sponsored and approved by Imperial College London’s 
Joint Research and Compliance Offi
  ce (JRCO), and was 
adopted by the National Institute for Health Research 
Clinical Research Network. The National Institute for 
Health Research/Wellcome Trust Imperial Clinical 
Research Facility gave site-specifi
 c approval for the study. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed up to Jan 30, 2016, using the terms 
“psilocybin”, “hallucinogens”, “psychedelics”, and 
“depression”. We did not fi
 nd any clinical trials assessing 
psilocybin as a treatment for depression, but we did fi
 nd 
population analyses, review articles, and imaging studies 
lending support to this approach. We also found one report 
documenting enduring decreases in depressive symptoms 
after a single dose of psilocybin in a randomised controlled 
trial of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for end-of-life 
anxiety, one report on an open-label trial showing rapid 
decreases in depressive symptoms that endured for up to 
21 days after a single dose of ayahuasca, and two early reports 
or case studies on the eff
 ects of lysergic acid diethylamide on 
“neurotic” and depressive symptoms describing 
“improvements”, albeit without validated measures of 
symptom severity.
Added value of this research
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst investigation of the safety and 
effi
  cacy of psilocybin as a treatment for major depression. 
Our fi
 ndings imply that psilocybin might have value as a treatment 
option in the management of treatment-resistant depression. 
Single oral administrations of 10 mg (safety dose) and 25 mg 
(treatment dose) psilocybin were well tolerated and led to 
enduring reductions in symptom severity after the two sessions.
Implications of all the available evidence
The results of this small-scale feasibility study should help to 
motivate further research into the effi
  cacy of psilocybin with 
psychological support for major depression. Larger-scale 
randomised controlled trials are warranted to better examine the 
potential of psilocybin as a treatment option for this highly 
prevalent, disabling, costly, and diffi
  cult-to-treat disorder. 
More broadly, the present study should help to catalyse the 
re-emergence of a promising research area in psychiatry.

The study was reviewed and approved by the Medicines 
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). All 
participants provided written informed consent. Study 
and data monitoring was carried out independently by the 
Imperial Clinical Research Facility and JRCO.
Procedures
Psilocybin was obtained from THC-pharm (Frankfurt, 
Germany) and formulated into the investigational 
medicinal product (5 mg psilocybin in size 0 capsules) 
by Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals’ Pharmacy 
Manufacturing Unit (London, UK). A Home Offi
  ce 
Licence for storage and dispensing of Schedule One 
drugs was obtained.
Screening consisted of written informed consent, a 
thorough evaluation of the patient’s physical and mental 
health background, a psychiatric interview (Mini-
International Neuropsychiatric Interview), clinician 
assessments of depression severity (the 21-item HAM-D 
and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 
[MADRS], and Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF]; 
all assessed by MBo), and additional patient-rated scales 
(16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms 
[QIDS], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI—original 
version], Spielberger’s State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 
[form 2, trait version only; STAI-T], and the Snaith-
Hamilton Pleasure Scale [SHAPS]). Patients also received 
a thorough physical health check, consisting of an 
electrocardiogram, routine blood tests, blood pressure, 
heart rate, and physical examination. At the end of 
screening, eligible patients were given an opportunity to 
meet with the two clinical psychiatrists who would 
support them through the remainder of the trial.
Eligible patients attended a subsequent visit involving a 
baseline functional MRI (fMRI) scanning session lasting 
60 min, followed by an extensive preparatory session 
with their allocated psychiatrists; fMRI data will be 
reported elsewhere. This preparatory session involved 
inviting the patient to talk openly about their personal 
history (including thoughts on the origins of their 
depression), a discussion of psilocybin’s psychological 
eff
 ects, and simulation of aspects of the dosing session 
itself, such as listening to a sample of the session music 
while wearing eyeshades. The preparatory session 
typically lasted for 4 h, with lunch and breaks provided.
Patients enrolled in the study attended two subsequent 
dosing sessions that were separated by 7 days. No more 
than one patient was dosed on any given day. Patients 
arrived at the research facility (Imperial Clinical Research 
Facility) at 0900 h, gave a urine sample for drugs of abuse 
(including amphetamines, benzodiazapines, opiates, 
and cannabinoids), performed a breathalyser test for 
alcohol use, and completed interim QIDS, BDI, and 
STAI-T assessments to ensure no substantial deviation 
from baseline measures. They were then taken to a 
dosing room that was pre-decorated (eg, with low 
lighting). Patients were invited to relax on a ward bed in a 
supine or reclined position and music was played 
through high-quality stereo speakers and earphones. The 
two psychiatrists sat on either side of the bed. Patients 
were supervised at all times by at least two staff
  members.
Dosing commenced at 1030 h in every case. Patients 
received a low oral dose of psilocybin 10 mg (two 5 mg 
capsules) on a fi
 rst dosing day and a high oral dose of 
psilocybin 25 mg (fi
 ve 5 mg capsules) on a second dosing 
day, separated by 1 week. Blood pressure, heart rate, and 
observer ratings of the intensity of psilocybin’s acute 
psychoactive eff
 ects (0–4, with 0 signifying no eff
 ects and 
4 signifying extreme eff
 ects8) were measured at baseline 
(typically 5 min before dosing) and 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 
300, and 360 min after dosing. Subjective ratings of the 
acute altered state of consciousness using the revised

11 dimension altered states of consciousness questionnaire 
(11D ASC)24 were completed 6–7 h after dosing.
Psychiatrists adopted a non-directive, supportive 
approach, allowing the patient to experience a mostly 
uninterrupted inner “journey”. Check-ins (ie, asking the 
patient how they are feeling) occurred at the same 
timepoints as the physiological recordings. Tranquilising 
medications (oral lorazepam and risperidone) were 
available if necessary. The phenomenology of the acute 
experience, including accounts of the nature of the 
therapeutic support provided before, during, and after 
the experience, and considerations related to the music 
selection and other aspects of the clinical setting, will be 
discussed in separate publications.
Return transport from the research facility was 
organised ahead of dosing sessions. Patients were taken 
to and from the sessions accompanied by a close friend 
or relative, and had the option of staying overnight in 
accommodation adjacent to the hospital. Emergency 
contact details were provided, and patients confi
 rmed 
their safe return from the research facility.
Patients were contacted via telephone 1 day after their 
low-dose session to check on their wellbeing and monitor 
for any adverse events. Patients returned to the research 
facility 1 day after their high-dose session for a post-
treatment fMRI scan lasting 60 min. After the fMRI 
scan, patients completed interim questionnaires (QIDS, 
STAI-T, and HAM-D), and were invited back to the 
research facility where they were met by their 
psychiatrists to discuss their experience the previous day.
Patients attended one further study visit to the research 
facility 1 week after their high-dose session, during which 
all baseline questionnaires and assessments were repeated 
and an opportunity was provided for further psychological 
debriefi
 ng (the 1 week follow-up visit). Assessments of 
HAM-D, MADRS, and GAF were again done by MBo. 
Subsequent assessments of clinical progress were done via 
email 2, 3, and 5 weeks after the high-dose session; we 
assessed only QIDS during subsequent follow-up, so as 
not to overload the patient. Final follow-up was done 
remotely at 3 months after the high-dose session, and 
included QIDS, BDI, STAI-T, and SHAPS. Patients were 
made aware that they could contact the study psychiatrists 
at any time if their depression deteriorated. Figure 1 
summarises the screening, intervention, and follow-up 
procedures in this study.
Outcomes
The main objective of this study is to optimise the protocol 
for the administration of oral psilocybin in this patient 
group, while gaining an initial impression of treatment 
effi
  cacy. The primary outcome measure to assess feasibility 
was patient-rated subjective intensity of psilocybin’s 
eff
 ects, which we report on a 0–1 scale. We assessed the 
safety of the intervention through clinical monitoring 
during and after dosing sessions, and during 3 months of 
face-to-face and remote follow-up. We also aimed to assess 
the preliminary effi
  cacy of psilocybin in patients with 
treatment-resistant depression; the primary outcome 
measure for this endpoint was mean change in the severity 
of self-reported depressive symptoms (with the 16 item 
QIDS) from baseline to 1 week after the high-dose 
psilocybin session. The QIDS was chosen as the primary 
outcome measure due to its brevity, increasingly 
widespread use, and validity at 1 week intervals.25 We chose 
to assess the primary effi
  cacy endpoint at 1 week after the 
high-dose session to allow comparison with previous 
studies of ketamine infusion for treatment-resistant 
depression;26 the low-dose session was conceived a priori 
as a safety session rather than a treatment session. We also 
assessed change in BDI, STAI-T, and SHAPS between 
baseline and 1 week and 3 months of follow-up, and 
change in HAM-D, MADRS, and GAF between baseline 
and 1 week of follow-up.
Statistical analysis
In this feasibility study, we did not perform a formal 
power calculation. We planned to recruit 12 patients to 
provide an initial impression of the tolerability and 
effi
  cacy of this novel treatment approach. A subsequent 
protocol amendment (Oct 6, 2015) increased the 
recruitment to 20 patients to provide statistical power 
for fMRI imaging. Here, we report fi
 ndings for the 
12 patients initially enrolled; outcome and fMRI data 
for all 20 patients will be reported separately.
Due to the small population, two-tailed Wilcoxon 
signed ranks tests were performed for non-parametric 
data. Two-tailed t tests were also performed and the 
relevant t values are provided in the appendix. We provide 
95% CIs around the mean diff
 erences. We calculated

This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 
number ISRCTN14426797
. The registration was initiated 
on March 30, 2015, and fi
 nalised on July 7, 2015 (delay 
caused by administrative issues); recruitment started on 
April 21, 2015, after initiation of public registration.
Role of the funding source
The study funder had no role in the design, data collection, 
analysis, interpretation, or writing of the report. The 
corresponding author had full access to all of the data in 
the study and had fi

submit for publication.
Results
Enrolment started on May 1, 2015, and fi
 nished on Aug 25, 
2015. 72 people were initially considered for the study, 
most of whom self-referred after hearing about this trial 
through public outreach work (eg, public presentations by 
the investigators and media reports). 38 were considered 
appropriate for a telephone screen, from which 18 were 
invited for a formal screening visit, and 12 were ultimately 
recruited for the trial (fi
 gure 2), of whom ten were self-
referrals. Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics 
are shown in table 1. Nine of the 12 patients met criteria 
for severe or very severe depression at baseline 
(BDI score ≥30), with the remaining three patients meet-
ing criteria for moderate depression (BDI score 19 to <30). 
11 patients had received some form of psychotherapy 
before participation in the study.
The acute effects of psilocybin were well tolerated by 
all of the patients and no serious or unexpected 
adverse events occurred. Mean self-rated intensity of 
psilocybin experience was 0·51 (SD 0·36) for the low-
dose session and 0·75 (0·27) for the high-dose session 
(difference 0·24 [95% CI 0·06–0·41], Z –2·4, p=0·019).

Table 2: Adverse events by patient

The most common adverse events were transient 
anxiety (mostly mild) during drug onset (n=12), 
transient confusion or thought disorder (n=9), mild and 
transient nausea (n=4), and transient headache (n=4; 
table 2). These adverse events were expected psycho-
logical eff
 ects of psilocybin. Subacute headache typically 
presented 1 day after the psilocybin session, and 
subsided after 1–2 days. Paranoia presented in only one 
patient, but this was mild and transient. No prolonged 
psychotic symptoms were observed in any of the 
patients. One patient contacted the study psychiatrists 
during the 3 months of follow-up due to deterioration of 
their depression, and was referred to their general 
practitioner.
QIDS depression scores were signifi
 cantly reduced 
from baseline to 1 week and 3 months post-treatment, 
with the maximum eff
 ect at 2 weeks (fi
 gure 3, table 3). 
BDI and clinician-administered ratings confi
 rmed 
these results (fi
 gure 4, table 3). All patients showed 
some reduction in depression severity at 1 week that 
was sustained in the majority for 3 months (appendix). 
According to standard criteria for determining 
remission (eg, a score of ≤9 on the BDI), eight (67%) of 
the 12 patients achieved complete remission at 1 week 
and seven patients (58%) continued to meet criteria for 
response (50% reduction in BDI score relative to 
baseline) at 3 months, with fi
 ve of these (42%) still in 
complete remission (fi
 gure 4, table 3). STAI-T anxiety 
scores were also signifi
 cantly reduced at 1 week and 
3 months post-treatment, as were SHAPS anhedonia 
scores for 1 week and 3 months post-treatment (table 3).
Discussion
In this open-label, single-arm pilot study, we sought to 
examine the feasibility of administering psilocybin to 
patients with treatment-resistant depression as a prelude 
to a larger randomised controlled trial. Our results support 
Figure 3: Mean depression severity (QIDS) over time
Depression severity determined by self-rated 16-item QIDS. QIDS scores of 
16–20 are considered to refl
 ect severe depression, scores of 11–15 are considered 
moderate depression, scores of 6–10 are considered mild depression, and scores 
of 5 and less are considered absent depression. All post-treatment assessments 
were obtained after the high-dose session (ie, 1 week post-treatment refers to 
1 week after the high-dose session). Hedges’ g values versus baseline are shown.

the view that, done with appropriate safeguards (eg, careful 
screening and adequate therapeutic support), psilocybin 
can be safely administered to this patient group.
Because this was a small-scale feasibility study with an 
open-label design, strong inferences cannot be made 
about the treatment’s therapeutic effi
  cacy. However, the 
data do suggest that further research is warranted. The 
response rate to psilocybin was 67% (n=8) at 1 week 
after treatment (HAM-D and BDI), and seven of these 
eight patients also met criteria for remission. Moreover, 
58% (n=7) of the patients maintained their response for 
3 months, and 42% (n=5) remained in remission. It is 
also worth noting that psilocybin has a favourable 
toxicity profi
 le and is not associated with compulsive 
drug-seeking behaviours in animals or human beings. 
The side-eff
 ects that we noted were minor, and expected 
in light of previous studies of psilocybin.27
Spontaneous recovery in refractory depression is rare, 
and many of the patients in the present study reported 
having depression for much of their adult lives 
(mean estimated illness duration 17·8 years [SD 8]). Key 
questions for future research therefore should address why 
the therapeutic eff
 ect observed in the present study is so 
large, and if it can be replicated when tighter experimental 
controls are introduced. Because the treatment in our study 
consisted of not just two psilocybin administrations but 
also psychological support before, during, and after these 
sessions, as well as a positive therapeutic environment for 
the sessions, the relative eff
 ects of these factors need to be 
determined, which can only be done by conducting further 
trials with appropriate control conditions.
A logical next step would be to carry out a placebo-
controlled randomised trial in which the level of therapist 
contact is consistent between conditions. This would 
enable any between-group diff
 erences in clinical 
outcomes to be attributed to psilocybin rather than the 
psychological support provided. However, a positive 
interaction between these variables seems likely, and 
inert placebo-based blinds are known to be ineff
 ective 
in studies involving conspicuous experimental inter-
ventions, because patients can easily discern whether 
they are in the active condition or not. Use of an active 
placebo for the control condition might therefore be 
worth considering. Additionally, randomised comparative 
effi
  cacy trials (eg, with an optional crossover component) 
incorporating another treatment for refractory depression 
(eg, ketamine infusion) could also be explored.
The magnitude and persistence of the antidepressant 
eff
 ects observed here are not incongruent with what has 
been observed previously with psilocybin in chronic 
psychiatric conditions. For example, 80% of long-term 
heavy tobacco smokers demonstrated abstinence from 
smoking 6 months after two treatment sessions with 
psilocybin.18 Alcohol-dependent patients demonstrated 
signifi
 cantly reduced drinking behaviours over 8 months 
after one or two psilocybin sessions.19 Signifi
 cantly 
decreased anxiety and depression scores were observed 
3 and 6 months after a single dose of psilocybin in 
patients with anxiety related to end-stage cancer,15 and 
improve 
ments in wellbeing lasting for more than 1 year 
were observed in healthy individuals given a single dose 
of psilocybin.8 Rapid and enduring decreases in depressive 
symptoms were also recently found in a small-scale 
feasibility trial involving the psychedelic brew, ayahuasca.16
It is important to consider the limitations of this pilot 
study; for example, although all patients showed some 
clinical improvements for at least 3 weeks after treatment, 
and no serious or unexpected adverse reactions were 
observed, enduring improvements beyond 3 weeks were 
not observed universally, and fi
 ve of the 12 patients 
showed a degree of relapse at 3 months.
One should be cautious of the potential for infl
 ated 
eff
 ect sizes in early trials, particularly when the sample 
size is small. That all patients showed some improvement 
in their depressive symptoms for up to 3 weeks after 
treatment could be suggestive of an expectancy bias. 
It may also be relevant that most patients in this trial were 
self-referring and, thus, actively sought this treatment. 
Psychedelics are known to promote suggestibility,28 which 
might have further enhanced positive outcomes. Future 
double-blind randomised controlled trials could address 
the role of expectancy and suggestibility by measuring and 
controlling these variables. For example, patients could be 
asked about their pre-treatment expectations, suggestions 
could be controlled between conditions, and outcomes 
from self-referred patients could be compared with those 
from patients referred via clinicians. From a more 
pragmatic perspective, if expectancy or suggestibility are 
found to be infl
 uential in the context of psychedelic 
therapy, they could be treated as exploitable components 
of the treatment model rather than confounding variables.

Serotonergic antidepressants have been found to down-
regulate the primary receptor target of psilocybin (the 
5-HT2A receptor) and attenuated subjective responses to 
psychedelics have previously been reported in individuals 
chronically medicated with serotonergic antidepressants.29 
Thus, patients may be required to withdraw from 
concurrent antidepressant medication before receiving 
psilocybin and this should only ever be done with care.
In conclusion, we sought to assess the safety and 
tolerability of psilocybin plus psychological support in 
patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. 
Our fi
 ndings support the feasibility of this approach and 
the magnitude and duration of the post-treatment 
reductions in symptom severity motivate further 
controlled research. Psilocybin has a novel pharma-
cological action in comparison with currently available 
treatments for depression (ie, 5-HT2A receptor agonism) 
and thus could constitute a useful addition to available 
therapies for the treatment of depression.
