IntroductIon
Pediatric drowning1–3 is treated with normobaric 100% 
oxygen to maintain adequate systemic oxygenation.1 Serious 
cases cause angiosomic-based4 deep gray matter and cortical5 
injury with resultant atrophy/ventricular dilatation.5,6 To our 
knowledge and investigation reversal of gray matter (cortical 
volume loss) and white matter atrophy (ventricular dilatation) 
are unreported with any therapy. We report subacute treatment 
of a severe pediatric drowning case with repetitive short-
duration normobaric oxygen and then hyperbaric oxygen that 
resulted in visually apparent and/or physical examination-
documented neurological improvement with each therapy and 
near-complete reversal of cortical and white matter atrophy 
on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Medical Center, Fayetteville, AR, USA, from a Glasgow 
Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, fixed dilated pupils, and body tem-
perature of 85.1°F (28.9°C) after a 15-minute submersion in 
41°F (5°C) water. After 100 minutes of cardio-pulmonary 
resuscitation, the arterial pH was 6.53. Following hypo-
thermia, vasopressors, ventilator support (10 days), and 
critical care at Arkansas Children’s Hospital, Little Rock, 
AR, USA, the patient was discharged home 35 days post 
drowning unresponsive to all stimuli, immobile with legs 
drawn to chest, and with constant squirming and head 
shaking. MRIs at 3 (Figure 1) and 31 (Figure 2) days post 
drowning showed thalamic injury then generalized atrophy 
with evolving gray and white matter injury.

A 2-year-old girl experienced cardiac arrest after cold water drowning. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed deep gray mat-
ter injury on day 4 and cerebral atrophy with gray and white matter loss on day 32. Patient had no speech, gait, or responsiveness to 
commands on day 48 at hospital discharge. She received normobaric 100% oxygen treatment (2 L/minute for 45 minutes by nasal 
cannula, twice/day) since day 56 and then hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) at 1.3 atmosphere absolute (131.7 kPa) air/45 minutes, 
5 days/week for 40 sessions since day 79; visually apparent and/or physical examination-documented neurological improvement oc-
curred upon initiating each therapy. After HBOT, the patient had normal speech and cognition, assisted gait, residual fine motor and 
temperament deficits. MRI at 5 months after injury and 27 days after HBOT showed near-normalization of ventricles and reversal of 
atrophy. Subacute normobaric oxygen and HBOT were able to restore drowning-induced cortical gray matter and white matter loss, as 
documented by sequential MRI, and simultaneous neurological function, as documented by video and physical examinations.

and post-normobaric oxygen therapy, shown at 7 minutes 
40 seconds mark and then 9 minutes mark). Neurological 
improvement rate increased over the ensuing 23 days with 
laughing, increased movement of arms, hands, grasp with 
the left hand, partial oral feeding, eye tracking, and short 
sentence speech (pre-drowning speech level, but with di-
minished vocabulary).  Physical (PT), occupational (OT), 
and speech therapy (ST) were added on the 10th day for 2 
weeks.
Seventy-eight days post-drowning, hyperbaric oxygen 
treatment (HBOT) commenced with compressed air at 1.3 
atmosphere absolute (1 ATA = 131.7 kPa) for 45 minutes 
total treatment time, once daily. Within hours the patient 
experienced decreased tone, increased gross motor ac-
tivity, vocabulary, and alertness. After 10 sessions of 
HBOT, the patient’s mother reported that the patient 
was “near normal, except for gross motor function;” 
PT was then reinstituted. After 39 sessions of HBOT, 
the patient exhibited: assisted gait, speech level greater 
than pre-drowning, near normal motor function, normal 
cognition, improvement on nearly all neurological exam 
abnormalities, discontinuance of all medications (buspar, 
propranolol, baclofen), and residual emotional, gait, and 
temperament deficits (Additional Video 1). Gait improve-
ment was documented immediately upon return home at

and 162 days post-drowning demonstrated mild residual 
injury and near-complete reversal of cortical and white 
matter atrophy (Figures 3–6), while further improved 
gait was documented at: https://www.youtube.com/watc

dIscussIon
Due to concern for oxygen toxicity,7,8 continuous nor-
mobaric oxygen in acute cerebral injury is only used for 
normalization of systemic oxygenation.1 Short duration 
normobaric oxygen has been applied to acute focal stroke9 
and traumatic brain injury,10 yet is unexplored in subacute 
hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Short duration 
hyperoxia at or slightly above the equivalent level of 
normobaric oxygen in our case, in the form of hyperbaric 
oxygen or air, has been achieved in chronic toxic brain 
injury,11 traumatic brain injury,12,13 autism,14 and cerebral 
palsy15,16 where it is used for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
signal transduction17,18 in combination with increased baro-
metric pressure.19,20 Intermittent hyperoxia and increased 
atmospheric pressure up- or down-regulate 8,101 genes in 
human endothelial cells.21 Sequential application of normo-
baric oxygen and hyperbaric oxygen in our patient caused 
visually apparent and/or physical examination-documented 
neurological improvements consistent with gene signaling 
effects of oxygen and then pressure20 as well as the clinical 
effects demonstrated in chronic neurological disorders.11-16 
Eight weeks post-drowning, our patient exhibited severe 
predictable1,2 neurological deficits and MRI findings4-6,22 that 
were reversed by short-duration normobaric oxygen and hy-
perbaric oxygen therapy. The decision to apply normobaric 
100% oxygen was dictated by author PGH’s inability to obtain 
HBOT in the patient’s location and PGH’s experience using 
normobaric 100% oxygen in unpublished cases of chronic 
multi-infarct dementia, traumatic brain injury and extremity 
ulcers. Cortical cystic lesion and cortical atrophy regression 
has been reported in a 2-year-old post-neonatal HIE, but 
white matter loss was unchanged.23 Spontaneous regression

it is impossible to conclude from this single case if the 
sequential application of normobaric oxygen then HBOT 
would be more effective than HBOT alone.  
conclusIon
Short duration normobaric oxygen and hyperbaric oxygen 
therapy in the subacute phase of drowning recovery resulted 
in video-documented near-complete resolution of severe 
neurological deficits and near-complete reversal of gray and 
white matter atrophy on MRI. Hyperoxic and hyperbaric 
gene signaling-induced growth of both gray and white mat-
ter is the most likely explanation.

of both cortical and white matter atrophy is contrary to the 
natural evolution of non-neonatal HIE.24 T2 signal changes 
on days 4 and 32 indicated permanent brain tissue injury or 
loss (increased fluid spaces) and limited tissue salvage/future 
neurological improvement. The diffuse regrowth of tissue 
was validated by visual inspection and multiple calculations. 
A minimum 12.3% volume loss (86 cm3, underestimated due 
to inclusion of enlarged ventricles) was restored to the normal 
volume of a 24–36-month-old child.
Functional imaging has been used since 1990 in chronic 
neurological disorders,25-43 to document HBOT-induced neu-
rological improvements. These improvements have evaded 
anatomical imaging due to the paucity of subacute pediatric 
cases, treatment of severe cases with large tissue loss, and the 
inability to capture metabolic25,29,30  and microscopic chang-
es,31,35,42,44 including microscopic neurogenesis.42,45 The star-
tling macroscopic regrowth of tissue in this case is explicable 
by early intervention prior to long-term tissue degeneration 
(e.g., Wallerian degeneration, apoptosis) in a growing child. 
The synergy of increased oxygen and increased oxygen with 
pressure in the hormone-rich childhood cerebral milieu is con-
sistent with the synergy of growth hormones and hyperbaric 
oxygen17,18 caused by normobaric and hyperbaric oxygen-
induced gene signaling trophic,21,46 anti-inflammatory,21,46 and 
anti-apoptotic effects21,46 on brain tissue.47 Trophism is the 
basis of oxygen and hyperbaric oxygen based wound-healing 
in animals and humans,48 including central nervous system 
injuries48 and is underscored in this patient by the concomitant 
rapid neurological improvements.
Substantial animal and human literature has demonstrated 
beneficial effects of hyperacute HBOT for resuscitation 
and post-resuscitation recovery from global ischemia/an-
oxia.49 Late application to drowning patients32,36 and other 
global ischemia patients28,49,50 produces more modest effects. 
When hyperacute HBOT is precluded by availability or 
other non-medical factors bridging short-duration repetitive 
normobaric oxygen therapy may be an option until HBOT 
is available. Such low-risk medical treatment may have a 
profound effect on recovery of function in similar patients 
who are neurologically devastated by drowning; however
