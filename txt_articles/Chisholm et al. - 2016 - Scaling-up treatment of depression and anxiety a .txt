Scaling-up treatment of depression and anxiety: a global 
return on investment analysis
Dan Chisholm, Kim Sweeny, Peter Sheehan, Bruce Rasmussen, Filip Smit, Pim Cuijpers, Shekhar Saxena
Summary
Background Depression and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and disabling disorders, which result not only in 
an enormous amount of human misery and lost health, but also lost economic output. Here we propose a global 
investment case for a scaled-up response to the public health and economic burden of depression and anxiety 
disorders.
Methods In this global return on investment analysis, we used the mental health module of the OneHealth tool to 
calculate treatment costs and health outcomes in 36 countries between 2016 and 2030. We assumed a linear increase 
in treatment coverage. We factored in a modest improvement of 5% in both the ability to work and productivity at 
work as a result of treatment, subsequently mapped to the prevailing rates of labour participation and gross domestic 
product (GDP) per worker in each country.
Findings The net present value of investment needed over the period 2016–30 to substantially scale up eff
 ective 
treatment coverage for depression and anxiety disorders is estimated to be US$147 billion. The expected returns to 
this investment are also substantial. In terms of health impact, scaled-up treatment leads to 43 million extra years of 
healthy life over the scale-up period. Placing an economic value on these healthy life-years produces a net present 
value of $310 billion. As well as these intrinsic benefi
 ts associated with improved health, scaled-up treatment of 
common mental disorders also leads to large economic productivity gains (a net present value of $230 billion for 
scaled-up depression treatment and $169 billion for anxiety disorders). Across country income groups, resulting 
benefi
 t to cost ratios amount to 2·3–3·0 to 1 when economic benefi
 ts only are considered, and 3·3–5·7 to 1 when the 
value of health returns is also included.
Interpretation Return on investment analysis of the kind reported here can contribute strongly to a balanced 
investment case for enhanced action to address the large and growing burden of common mental disorders worldwide.

Introduction
Worldwide, investments in mental health are very 
meagre. Data from WHO’s Mental Health Atlas 2014 
survey1 suggest that most low-income and middle-income 
countries spend less than US$2 per year per person on 
the treatment and prevention of mental disorders 
compared with an average of more than $50 in high-
income countries. As a result of this limited investment 
in public mental health, a substantial gap exists between 
the need for treatment and its availability. This large 
treatment gap aff
 ects not just the health and wellbeing of 
people with mental disorders and their families, but also 
has 
inevitable 
consequences 
for 
employers 
and 
governments as a result of diminished productivity at 
work, reduced rates of labour participation, foregone tax 
receipts, and increased health and other welfare 
expenditures. 
Findings 
of 
several 
national 
and 
international studies2–5 have shown the enormous 
economic challenge these disorders pose to communities 
and society at large as a result of foregone production 
and consumption opportunities as well as health and 
social care expenditures. In 2010, worldwide, an 
estimated US$2·5–8·5 trillion in lost output was 
attributed to mental, neurological and substance use 
disorders, depending on the method of assessment 
used.2 This sum is expected to nearly double by 2030 if a 
concerted response is not mounted.2 In view of this 
concern, the promotion of mental health and wellbeing 
have been explicitly included in the United Nations’ 
2015–30 Sustainable Development Goals.6
Cost-eff
 ectiveness studies have largely restricted 
themselves 
to 
a 
consideration 
of 
the 
specifi
 c 
implementation costs and health outcomes of an 
intervention, and have typically not extended to a full 
estimation of the wider socioeconomic value of 
investment in mental health innovation and service 
scale-up. As shown in the Lancet’s Commission on 
Investing in Health, elucidation and enumeration of 
these wider economic and social benefi
 ts provides a 
more comprehensive assessment of the returns on 
investment.7 In particular, increasing attention and 
emphasis is being given to extending valuation to also 
include the intrinsic value of improved health (a so-called 
full income approach to national accounting).7

Here we did a global return on investment analysis for 
mental health in people aged 15 years and older focusing 
on depression and anxiety disorders, which are the most 
prevalent mental disorders. These disorders lead to large 
losses in work participation and productivity, and yet 
lend themselves to eff
 ective and accessible treatment as 
part of an integrated programme of chronic disease 
management.8–10
Methods
Analytical framework
Because depression and anxiety disorders represent a 
public health challenge worldwide, we did a global 
investment appraisal in low-income, middle-income, and 
high-income countries. The 36 countries for which we 
modelled costs and benefi
 ts of scaled-up treatment, 
which span all six of WHO’s major regions, account for 
80% of the world’s population and 80% of the global 
burden of depression and anxiety disorders (appendix p 1). 
Results for these countries were aggregated and reported 
by income level (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, high). 
We set the scale-up period at 2016–30, in line with the 
timeline of the post-2015 Sustainable Development 
Goals.
The economic and social benefi
 ts of good mental 
health include both its intrinsic value (improved mental 
health and wellbeing) and also its instrumental value, in 
terms of being able to form and maintain relationships, 
to work or pursue leisure interests, and to make decisions 
in everyday life. To assess the value of these benefi
 ts, fi
 rst 
we estimated the population in need in each country, 
then established the health eff
 ects of scaled-up coverage 
of eff
 ective intervention, and fi
 nally calculated the 
economic eff
 ect of improved mental health outcomes in 
terms of enhanced labour participation and productivity. 
Panel 1 provides more detail on the health and economic 
benefi
 ts captured in, and omitted from, the analysis. The 
key outputs of the model are year-on-year estimates of 
the total costs of treatment scale-up and system 
strengthening (ie, the investment), increased healthy 
life-years gained as a result of treatment (ie, health 
return), the value associated with better health (ie, the 
value of health returns), and enhanced levels of 
productivity (ie, economic return). The stream of costs 
incurred and benefi
 ts obtained between 2016 and 2030 
were discounted at a rate of 3%, to give a net present 
value. All costs and monetised benefi
 ts were expressed in 
constant US$ for the year 2013.
Population and disease modelling
We used the mental health module of the inter-UN 
agency OneHealth tool to estimate the number of people 
with depression and anxiety disorders living in the 
36 large countries until 2030. Estimates are based on UN 
population projections and Global Burden of Disease 
prevalence estimates for 2010.11,12 The global point 
prevalence rate for anxiety disorders is 7·3%;13 for 
depression it is 3·2% for men, and 5·5% for women.14 
The OneHealth tool also links the epidemiology of 
depression and anxiety disorders (prevalence, incidence, 
remission, excess mortality, and disability weight)12–14 to 
country-specifi
 c life tables, so that cases averted and 
Research in context
Systematic review
We did a systematic review of studies published until Jan 1, 
2015, of the eff
 ect of treatment of depression and anxiety 
disorders on economic outcomes (return to work, absenteeism, 
and presenteeism rates). We searched an existing database on 
psychological treatments of depression, which has been 
described in detail by Cuijpers and colleagues, and has been 
used in a series of earlier published meta-analyses. We 
identifi
 ed abstracts by combining terms indicative of 
psychological treatment and depression (both medical subject 
headings terms and text words; search terms listed in appendix 
p 4). For this database, we examined 17 061 abstracts from 
PubMed (4007 abstracts), PsycINFO (3147 abstracts), Embase 
(5912 abstracts), and the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (3995 abstracts). We included all randomised 
trials comparing a psychological treatment with a control 
condition (waiting list, care as usual, placebo), another 
psychological treatment, pharmacotherapy, or combined 
treatment. We excluded studies in adolescents, children, and 
inpatients, and maintenance trials. We scrutinised all 
440 studies identifi
 ed in this database for economic outcome 
data. Although four studies had data for functioning at work, 
they did not report suffi
  cient detail. Accordingly, we did an 
additional search on May 21, 2105, to widen our search to 
include anxiety disorders with greater emphasis on economic 
outcomes in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane 
Library (search terms listed in appendix p 5). We found few 
useful data and these could not be synthesised 
meta-analytically. The same conclusion was made in a similar 
review of the scientifi
 c literature.
Interpretation
This analysis sets out a model linking the prevalence of 
depression and anxiety disorders with expected health and 
economic benefi
 ts of scaled-up treatment, including restored 
labour participation and productivity. Results from the analysis 
suggest that monetised benefi
 ts of better health and labour 
force outcomes outweigh the costs of achieving them by 
2·3–3·0 to 1 when economic benefi
 ts only are considered, and 
3·3–5·7 to 1 when the value of health returns is also included.
Treatment of common mental disorders leads to improvements 
in economic production and health outcomes. Clinicians should 
increase the detection and management of people with 
depression and anxiety disorders.

healthy life-years gained over time at the population level 
can be estimated. Healthy life-years refl
 ect time spent by 
the population in a particular state of health with a 
known degree of disability. Estimation of healthy life-
years for depression took into account its association 
with excess mortality (due to suicide and other causes of 
death).14
Intervention eff
 ects, costs, and coverage
Intervention eff
 ects
We restricted the analysis of interventions within the 
OneHealth tool to treatment because the evidence on 
prevention of depression and anxiety is quite weak and of 
uncertain generalisability to low-income and middle-
income country settings.15 In line with WHO’s Mental 
Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) intervention 
guide, modelled interventions included basic psycho-
social treatment for mild cases, and either basic or more 
intensive psychosocial treatment plus anti 
depressant 
drug for moderate to severe cases.16 Moderate to severe 
cases of depression were split into fi
 rst-episode and 
recurrent episode cases. We calculated the health eff
 ect 
of treatment in terms of a proportionate improvement in 
the rate of remission, equivalent to a shortening of the 
duration of an episode of illness, and also, up to the point 
of recovery, an improvement in the average level of 
functioning as refl
 ected in the disability weight for the 
disorder.8,10 The appendix shows the eff
 ect size estimates 
and their derivation (appendix p 2); these take into 
account partial response, the lag time between onset of 
the disorder and treatment, and expected levels of non-
adherence in treated populations.
Intervention costs
We worked out total costs in a given year for a country 
by multiplying resource use needs by their respective 
unit costs to give a cost per case, which was then 
multiplied by the total number of cases expected to 
receive a particular intervention. Country-specifi
 c unit 
costs of inpatient and outpatient care were taken from a 
WHO database, adjusted to 2013 price levels.17 Treatment 
costs relied on previous cost-eff
 ectiveness studies and 
resource need profi
 les garnered from existing treatment 
guidelines and costing studies.10,16,18,19 Key categories of 
resource use were: medication: 6 months continual 
antidepressant drug (generically produced fl
 uoxetine) 
was included for moderate to severe cases; outpatient 
and primary care: regular visits were needed for all 
cases, ranging from four per case per year for basic 
psychosocial treatment, up to 14–18 visits for moderate 
to severe cases receiving antidepressant drug and 
intensive psychosocial treatment (half of whom are 
assumed to receive this on an individual basis, the other 
half in groups); in line with the mhGAP intervention 
guide, it is envisaged that this care and follow-up would 
largely be undertaken in non-specialist health care 
settings by doctors, nurses and psychosocial care 
providers trained in the identifi
 cation, assessment, and 
management of depression and anxiety disorders; and 
inpatient care: few cases are expected to be admitted to 
hospital (2–3% of moderate to severe cases only, for an 
average length of stay of 14 days).
Additionally, we included an estimate of the expected 
level of programme costs and shared health system 
resources needed to deliver interventions as part of an 
Panel 1: Health, economic, and social benefi
 ts of scaled-up treatment for depression 
and anxiety disorders
Health eff
 ects
To establish the eff
 ect of treatment, we used rates of improved recovery or remission and 
levels of functioning. Improved functioning translates into fewer life-years spent by the 
population in a state of diminished health, whereas an increased rate of remission leads 
to a decrease in the prevalence of these disorders over time. Depression is also associated 
with an excess risk of premature mortality because of suicide and other causes of death. 
We projected a reduction in excess mortality, amounting to an increase in healthy life 
expectancy, as a result of averting cases of depression in the population. Although 
depression and anxiety disorders are often comorbid with each other, and with a range of 
other health disorders (eg, substance use disorder, other non-communicable diseases and, 
in certain populations, in people with HIV/AIDS) we were not able to account for these 
comorbidities in the analysis. Additionally, we were unable to capture the positive eff
 ect 
of treatment on the mental and physical health of close family members, including 
infants of mothers with perinatal depression, despite robust evidence that depression can 
adversely aff
 ect infant attachment and subsequent child growth and cognitive 
development.
Economic eff
 ects
A direct potential benefi
 t of successfully treating common mental disorders is a decrease in 
overall health-care costs. Although interventions have their own costs, these can be more 
than off
 set by a reduction in other services, notably hospital-based inpatient episodes or 
outpatient visits. Reduced use of informal and indigenous health-care providers, such as 
faith healers or traditional healers, is a further expected source of cost savings in many 
countries. Estimation of the predicted extent of these cost off
 sets is very challenging at the 
international level because it requires detailed information about both the varying level of 
comorbidity across diverse populations and the typical use of non-intervention related 
services. Accordingly, we did not explicitly consider such eff
 ects in our analysis. Similarly, we 
did not have suffi
  cient information across countries to model the reduced need for other 
welfare-related services potentially available to people with depression and anxiety 
disorders, including unemployment benefi
 t or income support and social or disability 
assistance. In the mainly high-income countries where such welfare support is widely 
available, depression and other common mental disorders account for a signifi
 cant 
proportion of overall payments.5 Instead, the analysis focused on the fi
 nancial benefi
 ts 
fl
 owing from increased rates of workforce participation and productivity. The analysis only 
considers the contribution to the economy as a whole through increased economic output; 
it does not estimate the various income shares of this output.
Social eff
 ects
Conceptually distinct from improvements in clinical functioning (health eff
 ect) and the 
restored ability to do paid work (economic eff
 ect), the successful treatment of depression 
and anxiety disorders leads to improved opportunities for individuals and households to 
pursue their leisure interests, participate more in social and community activities, and 
carry out household production roles. The economic worth of these non-market 
production and welfare gains is incorporated into our estimate of the intrinsic value of 
mental health.

integrated model of chronic disease management. These 
include programme management and administration, 
training and supervision, drug safety monitoring, health 
promotion and awareness campaigns, and strengthened 
logistics and information systems. We expressed 
estimates as an on-cost to the estimated direct health-
care costs. The baseline value for this on-cost was 10% 
(and therefore grows in absolute terms during scale-up).
Intervention coverage
The appendix provides coverage rates used for each 
individual intervention at diff
 erent levels of national 
income (appendix p 3). Summing across all interventions 
and their respective populations in need, it is estimated 
that—depending on the income level of the country—
between 7% and 28% of all people with depression 
currently receive treatment, equivalent to a treatment gap 
of 72–93% (table 1). A gradual, linear increase in treat-
ment coverage to a third of all cases in low-income 
countries and to more than half of cases in high-income 
countries would close the current gap by 29–39%; the use 
of separate target coverage rates for low-income, middle-
income, and high-income countries refl
 ects diff
 erences 
in which they stand now with respect to treatment 
coverage, and are intended to refl
 ect what has been 
achieved through programme scale-up eff
 orts in countries 
such as Chile and the UK.20 Because of even lower starting 
coverage levels, the modelled gap reduction for anxiety 
disorders is lower than for depression (16–25%).
Eff
 ect of labour force on treatment
We modelled the economic eff
 ect of decreased morbidity 
in terms of increased participation in and increased 
productivity of the workforce. With regards to labour 
force participation, very few studies have assessed the 
extent to which eff
 ective depression treatments get 
people back into work, and when measured, estimates 
have been subject to local factors such as prevailing levels 
of unemployment in the economy (panel 2).21–24 For our 
base case, we conservatively modelled a 5% restored 
ability to work as a result of treatment, with half and 
double that rate used under pessimistic and optimistic 
scenario analyses. Impaired productivity was assessed 
both with respect to whole days off
  work (absenteeism) 
and also partial days of impaired activity while an 
individual is at work (presenteeism). Compared with 
adults without common mental disorders in a range of 
low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries 
participating in the World Mental Health Survey, 
4–15 more days out of role per year were recorded 
because of depression and 8–24 days because of 
generalised anxiety disorders; additional time lost per 
year due to presenteeism was 11–25 partial disability days 
for depression and 12–26 for generalised anxiety 
disorders.25,26 Again, there are few empirical studies upon 
which to base estimates of the eff
 ect of eff
 ective treatment 
of depression and anxiety on productivity, and these 
point towards small diff
 erences between intervention 
and control groups (panel 2).27–33 Expressed as a proportion 
of total working days per year (220 days), and allowing 
for both the onset of eff
 ect as well as the time lag between 
improved health and return to work, we modelled a 5% 
increase in working days as a result of reduced 
absenteeism, and a 5% increase through reduced 
presenteeism. Again, these baseline values were varied 
up and down by a factor of 2 and 0·5, respectively, in an 
uncertainty analysis. These losses in and returns to 
productivity were linked to the prevailing rates of labour 
participation in the working age population (age 
15–65 years) and gross domestic product (GDP) per 
worker in each of the 36 assessed countries34,35 to calculate 
productivity losses at current levels of treatment coverage 
and productivity gains after scaled-up treatment. The 
model does not account for potential changes in 
retirement age or working patterns over time, although 
an increase in retirement age and more fl
 exible working 
patterns might enhance the overall productivity gains by 
people with depression and anxiety with treatment.
Economic value of health benefi
 ts
Improvements in labour force outcomes represent the 
instrumental value of improved mental health after 
eff
 ective treatment of common mental disorders. 
Independent of this instrumental value, being alive and 
healthy is also valuable in itself. For this analysis, we 
followed the approach adopted by Stenberg and 
colleagues,36 who divided the overall value of a life-year 
into its economic (instrumental) and health (intrinsic) 
elements. For the Lancet Commission on Investing in 
health, the value of a 1 year increase in life expectancy in 
low-income and middle-income countries was estimated 
to be 2·3 times per person national income, and 
1·6 times per person national income worldwide (using a 
discount rate of 3%).7 Stenberg and colleagues36 attributed 
two-thirds of that derived value to the instrumental 
components, which are measured here directly via the

labour force outcomes, leaving the remaining third for 
the intrinsic benefi
 ts of health, which is equivalent to 
0·5 times per person income.
Uncertainty analysis
We assessed the sensitivity of results to plausible 
variations around these and other key input parameters 
by constructing optimistic and pessimistic scale-up 
scenarios. For the upper estimate: total investment costs 
were assumed to be 20% lower than baseline, as a result 
of lower than expected use of expensive hospital 
outpatient and inpatient care or the development of more 
effi
  cient interventions, including internet-based treat-
ments; and productivity eff
 ects were set at double their 
baseline rate (10% rather than 5%); the intrinsic value of 
a year of health life was set at 0·7 times GDP per person 
(rather than 0·5). For the lower estimate: total investment 
costs were assumed to be 20% higher than baseline, as a 
result of higher than expected drug prices, service use 
and programme management; productivity eff
 ects were 
set at half their baseline rate (2·5% rather than 5%); and 
the intrinsic value of a year of health life was set at 
0·3 times GDP per person (rather than 0·5).
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. The corresponding author had full 
access to all the data in the study and had fi
 nal 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Across the 36 largest countries in the world, in the absence 
of scaled-up treatment, it is projected that more than 
12 billion days of lost productivity (equivalent to more than 
50 million years of work) are attributable to depression and 
anxiety disorders every year, at an estimated cost of 
US$925 billion. Assuming the same distribution of costs 
across lower-income and higher-income countries holds 
for all other countries (representing 20% of the world’s 
population), the global cost per year is $1·15 trillion. 
Compared with people without these disorders, 4·7 billion 
extra days are lost, at a cost of $592 billion (36% of the total 
cost); this fi
 gure can be termed the excess productivity loss 
of these disorders (fi
 gure 1).
Table 2 shows the estimated cost of scaling up treatment 
for depression and anxiety, expressed as the net present 
value of the total expenditure required over the scaling-up 
period between 2016 and 2030 (ie, the cumulative cost 
over 15 years of steady scale-up, but discounted at a rate of 
3%). These costs relate to incremental treatment coverage 
in the population over and above current levels of 
coverage. For all 36 countries, the total cost amounts to 
US$91 billion for depression and $56 billion for anxiety 
disorders. Treatment of mild cases accounts for less than 
10% of total costs for depression and 20% for anxiety 
Panel 2: Labour force eff
 ects of treatment
Labour force participation
There are very few studies showing the extent to which eff
 ective 
depression treatments get people back into work. Two studies 
undertaken in the USA reported a 6% increase in employment 
retention in patients with depression whose care was monitored 
and managed closely.20,21 Findings of another US study22 of patients 
in primary care showed that, at 6 months, employment rates were 
52·5% for patients with no care versus 72·2% for patients with care. 
For low-income and middle-income countries, programme 
evaluation data for livelihoods from four countries—China, India, 
Ghana, and Pakistan—were made available by BasicNeeds, which 
showed that the proportion of people with depression undertaking 
income-generating activities increased by more than 50%, and in 
those with anxiety by more than 30% (Chris Underhill, BasicNeeds, 
personal communication). These estimates are in line with the 
assessment of the BasicNeeds programme in Kenya, which for a 
more mixed caseload showed an 43% improvement in the 
proportion of enrollees in income generation or productive work.23 
Because these data are based on observation rather than under 
controlled trial conditions, we can infer only a clear association 
between exposure to treatment and subsequent earnings rather 
than a defi
 nitive eff
 ect of intervention. For our base case, we 
therefore conservatively modelled a 5% restored ability to work as 
a result of treatment, with half and double that rate used under 
pessimistic and optimistic scenario analyses.
Labour force productivity
A comprehensive review of 440 published trials in an existing 
database of psychological and pharmaceutical interventions in 
depression24 was specifi
 cally undertaken for this project (by 
researchers at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, 
Netherlands, and the Trimbos Institute, Utrecht, Netherlands) 
to identify the eff
 ect of eff
 ective treatment on productivity; 
unfortunately, very few trials reported these eff
 ects. However, 
some treatment trials done in the USA, Korea, and India have 
estimated the eff
 ect of intervention on productivity loss. The 
decrease in absenteeism reported in these studies was close to 
1 day per month.20,29–32 Only two studies reported the fi
 ndings 
for presenteeism separately from days lost because of 
absenteeism: in the Korean study, treated patients had 24 more 
productive hours per month,29 whereas in the Indian study, 
patients receiving the collaborative care had 4 fewer partial 
days lost than controls.30 By conservatively assuming that 
1 partial day is equivalent to a third of a whole day, we estimate 
that almost 1 complete day of unimpaired work is restored per 
month through reduced presenteeism. Expressed as a 
proportion of total working days per year (220 days), and 
allowing for both the onset of eff
 ect and the time lag between 
improved health and return to work, a 5% increase in working 
days is gained through reduced absenteeism, and a 5% increase 
through reduced presenteeism.

disorders. After standardising for population size, the 
cost is actually quite low; for depression treatment, the 
average annual cost during 15 years of scaled-up 
investment is $0·08 per person in low-income countries, 
$0·34 in lower middle-income countries, $1·12 in upper 
middle-income countries and $3·89 in high-income 
countries (table 2). Per person costs for anxiety disorders 
are nearly half that of depression.
Table 2 shows results for two key health outcomes: cases 
averted (reduced prevalence) and healthy life-years gained 
(equivalent to disability-adjusted life-years averted). Across 
the 36 countries represented in the analysis, we recorded a 
small decrease in the estimated prevalence of depression 
and anxiety disorders as a result of treated cases recovering 
from illness more quickly; in the next 15 years, this gradual 
decrease in prevalence translates into millions of averted 
cases (73 million fewer cases of depression, and 45 million 
fewer cases of anxiety disorder). Weighting these averted 
prevalent cases by the average level of improved 
functioning or reduced disability provides a measure of 
healthy life-years gained. For depression and anxiety 
disorders combined, the cumulative number of healthy 
life-years gained over 15 years is 43 million.
Table 2 also shows the diff
 erence in aggregate GDP 
between a continued current coverage scenario and one 
refl
 ecting scaled-up treatment and enhanced productivity; 
again, this and the total economic return for the entire 
period of scale-up has been discounted at 3% to give a net 
present value. For all 36 countries combined, the net 
present value is $399 billion ($230 billion for depression 
and $169 billion for anxiety disorders). The intrinsic 
value of health returns show a net present value of more 
than $250 billion for scaled-up depression treatment and 
more than $50 billion for anxiety disorders (table 2).

By summing the discounted costs and benefi
 ts for all 
countries in an income group, we derived a summary 
measure of the relationship between the benefi
 ts of 
scaled-up treatment and the associated costs of 
investment (table 2, fi
 gure 2). Restricting assessment to 
the economic returns to investment, benefi
 t to cost 
ratios for scaled-up depression treatment across 
country income groupings were in the range of 
2·3 to 2·6. For anxiety disorders the ratios were slightly 
higher (range 2·7–3·0). Extension of the benefi
 t–cost 
analysis to include the estimated value of health returns 
increased the ratio of benefi
 t to cost, especially for 
depression because of the higher health returns for this 
disorder compared with anxiety disorders. Benefi
 t to 
cost ratios for depression now exceed those for anxiety 
disorders (range 4·2–5·7), and were more than double 
the ratio when only economic benefi
 ts of depression 
treatment scale-up were considered. Benefi
 t to cost 
ratios for anxiety disorders increased by a third 
(range 3·3–4·0).
We did uncertainty analysis to ascertain the sensitivity 
of results to plausible changes in key study parameters. 
Benefi
 t to cost ratios fell to or almost reached parity 
under the more pessimistic scenario when only economic 
benefi
 ts were considered, and did not exceed 3 even 
when the value of health benefi
 ts was included (fi
 gure 2). 
By contrast, the more optimistic scenario produces 
benefi
 t to cost ratios of 5·5–7·2 (economic benefi
 ts only) 
and 7·5–11·3 when the value of health benefi
 ts was 
added in. As expected, results were quite sensitive to the 
estimated rate of enhanced labour participation and 
productivity. We also assessed the eff
 ect of changing the 
rate used to discount future costs and benefi
 ts to the 
present time. At a discount rate of 6%, the net present 
value of total investments and returns would be 25% 
less; with no discounting, they would be 35% higher in 
absolute terms. Because such a change in discount rate 
was applied to both costs and benefi
 ts, the ratio of benefi
 t 
to cost, our summary return on investment metric, is not 
aff
 ected.
Discussion
This analysis sets out, for the fi
 rst time, a global 
investment case for a scaled-up response to the massive 
public health and economic burden of depression and 
anxiety disorders. Previous international economic 
studies of mental health have assessed the economic 
eff
 ect of these disorders,2,3 the cost-eff
 ectiveness of 
diff
 erent intervention strategies,8,10 and the cost of scaling 
up care,18,19 but not the value of both economic and health 
benefi
 ts of intervention scale up.
Notwithstanding the general limitations of any 
projection modelling study, the analysis suggests that the 
investment needed to substantially scale up eff
 ective 
treatment coverage for depression and anxiety disorders 
in the 36 countries included in this analysis is substantial; 
the net present value of all investments between 2016 
and 2030 is $147 billion, equivalent to less than $10 billion 
per year on average. Extending the scope to the 20% of 
the world’s population not living in the 36 countries 
represented in the study would increase the cost by about 
25% to $184 billion. However, the returns to this

investment are also substantial, with benefi
 t to cost ratios 
of 2·3–3·0 when economic benefi
 ts only are considered, 
and 3·3–5·7 when the value of health returns are also 
included. To put these fi
 ndings into context, any benefi
 t 
to cost ratio exceeding 1 provides a rationale for 
investment. Compared with some other potential 
investments in health, ratios of the order reported here 
can be deemed relatively modest. For example, a return 
on investment analysis for malaria, also for 2016–30, but 
using the full value of a statistical life-year, estimated 
benefi
 t to cost ratios in the range of 28:1 to 40:1.37 An 
investment case done for maternal, reproductive, 
neonatal, and child health obtained a benefi
 t to cost ratio 
of less than 10:1 for 2013–35,36 which is closer to the 
results obtained in this study. Inclusion of other benefi
 ts 
arising from scaled-up treatment of common mental 
disorders that could not be captured though the present 
modelling exercise, notably reduced welfare support 
payments, and improved outcomes for other aff
 ected 
people (eg, partners and children of women with 
perinatal depression) would generate higher ratios of 
benefi
 t to cost. Set against that, treatment programmes 
might cost more or achieve less than anticipated, as 
highlighted by the uncertainty analysis.
One limitation of our study is that although the 
projected level of overall prevalence of depression and 
anxiety disorders is quite well-established,12-14 the same 
cannot be said for treated prevalence. The analysis done 
here allows for a gradual linear increase in eff
 ective 
service coverage for depression and anxiety disorders in 
all parts of the world in the next 15 years. However, for 
this to happen, not only will a new level of political 
commitment and resource mobilisation be required, but 
also a signifi
 cant reorientation of public health systems 
towards chronic disease identifi
 cation and management.9 
Partial or weak implementation of envisaged treatment 
programmes, including appropriate management of 
recurrent cases of depression or insuffi
  cient promotion 
and awareness programmes, will inevitably reduce the 
number of cases eff
 ectively reached and therefore the 
health and other benefi
 ts obtained. It is also possible that 
as treatment coverage in the population increases 
substantially, the average cost per case might go up, for 
example as a result of reaching out to more remote or 
less well-served parts of a country. Target coverage rates 
were accordingly set at a modest level in this analysis (an 
upper value of 56% of depression cases in high-income 
countries). Aside from projected treatment coverage and 
eff
 ectiveness, a further crucial parameter for this analysis 
concerns the eff
 ect of treatment on labour force 
participation and productivity, for which there remains a 
paucity of evidence. As concluded by a systematic review, 
such data are not hard to collect alongside clinical trials 
and other studies, and need to be uniformly measured 
more often.27 More generally, population health models 
(eg, the OneHealth tool) rely on many input parameters, 
data sources, and assumptions regarding expected rates 
of disease, demographic change, and intervention eff
 ects 
in the future, which limits their precision.
Several eff
 ects were not included in the analysis. One 
was the negative eff
 ect of maternal depression on early 
child development, for which there is clear evidence;38 
the health, social, and economic benefi
 ts of eff
 ective 
treatment of maternal depression on the cognitive and 
physical development of newly born babies was not 
assessed, but there is some evidence that this could be 
substantial over the longer term.39 Likewise, the monetary 
and non-monetary impact of eff
 ective treatment on 
family and other caregivers has not been factored in. 
Additionally, no account has been taken of the substantial 
eff
 ect of depression and its treatment on physical health 
outcomes; depression is a risk factor for disorders such 
as hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, and 
substance use disorders (just as these conditions are risk 
factors for depression), and adversely aff
 ects outcomes 
through reduced help-seeking and adherence.40 Inclusion 
of these additional eff
 ects of treatment would bolster 
identifi
 ed economic returns. Taking appropriate account 
of the regular co-occurrence of depression and anxiety in 
individuals would be expected to lead to strong synergies 
on the treatment side, leading to potentially reduced 
investment costs, but health and economic outcomes for 
these comorbid cases might be slower or harder to 
achieve.
Although the analysis accounted for age and sex (eg, in 
terms of disease prevalence, labour force participation 
and treatment eligibility), it was not possible to consider 
the eff
 ect of socioeconomic status as a mediator and 
predictor of good health and economic outcomes. 
Poverty has an adverse eff
 ect on the risk of depression 
and anxiety disorders through higher levels of stress, 
social exclusion, violence and trauma, but the evidence 
base for the mental health eff
 ect of interventions 
targeted at the poor remains insubstantial.41 In many 
countries, poor people face signifi
 cant barriers to 
accessing services, including the fi
 nancial cost of 
seeking and paying towards health care. Finally, it should 
be acknowledged that the workplace itself can be a 
source of stress for many people, and that there is a 
consequent need to integrate mental health and 
wellbeing into new or existing employee support 
programmes.
A crucial issue related to but outside the scope of this 
return on investment analysis is the source of fi
 nancing 
for investments required to scale-up services for 
depression and anxiety disorders. As previously noted, 
the absolute amount needed for investment (eg, on a per 
person basis) is modest, but because existing service 
coverage level is so low in most countries, the gap 
between current and required spending can be large.18,19 
Accordingly, both rich and poor countries need to 
carefully consider the merits of diff
 erent health fi
 nancing 
mechanisms. For many countries, the fi
 rst question to 
address concerns the extent to which domestic fi
 nancing 
 Articles

423
represents a feasible and suffi
  cient method for fi
 nancing 
mental health services, perhaps as part of a package of 
measures to be paid for from enhanced revenue 
generation. For low-income countries eligible for offi
  cial 
development assistance, a second question might be to 
what 
extent 
external 
funding 
can 
complement 
domestically generated resources to catalyse service 
development. In countries where domestic or external 
funding mechanisms are expected to fall short of 
requirements or pose a risk to fi
 scal stability, a further 
question relates to the extent to which market-based 
fi
 nancing options such as bonds off
 er a suitable and 
feasible approach to generating and providing funds for 
outcomes-based scale-up for mental health services.
The pursuit of any of these methods of fi
 nancing will 
be aff
 ected by other factors, including the amount of 
investment needed, the level of political will and also 
fi
 scal space for raising new resources for health, and 
eligibility of the country for bilateral or multilateral 
funding. Faced with a new and broad development 
agenda,6 governments need to assure themselves that 
investment in the mental health of their populations 
represents a sound and equitable investment of society’s 
resources that leads to clear and defi
 nable health, 
economic, and social benefi
 ts. Our return on investment 
analysis, coupled with an assessment of health-system 
needs and priorities, and the broader macro-fi
 scal 
situation, can contribute to a balanced investment case 
for common mental disorders and the health sector more 
generally.
