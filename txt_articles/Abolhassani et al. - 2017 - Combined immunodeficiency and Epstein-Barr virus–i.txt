In this study, we describe four patients from two unrelated families of different ethnicities with a primary immunodeficiency, 
predominantly manifesting as susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–related diseases. Three patients presented with EBV- 
associated Hodgkin’s lymphoma and hypogammaglobulinemia; one also had severe varicella infection. The fourth had viral en-
cephalitis during infancy. Homozygous frameshift or in-frame deletions in CD70 in these patients abolished either CD70 surface 
expression or binding to its cognate receptor CD27. Blood lymphocyte numbers were normal, but the proportions of memory B 
cells and EBV-specific effector memory CD8+ T cells were reduced. Furthermore, although T cell proliferation was normal, in 
vitro–generated EBV-specific cytotoxic T cell activity was reduced because of CD70 deficiency. This reflected impaired activation 
by, rather than effects during killing of, EBV-transformed B cells. Notably, expression of 2B4 and NKG2D, receptors implicated in 
controlling EBV infection, on memory CD8+ T cells from CD70-deficient individuals was reduced, consistent with their impaired 
killing of EBV-infected cells. Thus, autosomal recessive CD70 deficiency is a novel cause of combined immunodeficiency and 
EBV-associated diseases, reminiscent of inherited CD27 deficiency. Overall, human CD70–CD27 interactions therefore play a 
nonredundant role in T and B cell–mediated immunity, especially for protection against EBV and humoral immunity.

INTrODuCTION
Nearly 300 types of inborn errors of immunity, mainly caused 
by mutations in single genes, have been recognized to date 
(Picard et al., 2015). These primary immunodeficiencies 
(PIDs) predispose affected individuals to infections, autoin‑
flammation, autoimmunity, allergy, and malignancy. The se‑
verity of PIDs ranges from life‑threatening manifestations in 
early childhood to milder defects with later onset. Prototypic 
PIDs are typically monogenic but do not necessarily display 
complete clinical penetrance, as genetically affected relatives 
of index cases may be asymptomatic. In addition, several phe‑
notypes can be allelic at the same locus, allowing the clinical 
presentation of any given inborn error to vary greatly between 
individuals. Although the first‑described PIDs were associated 
with multiple, recurrent, opportunistic infections, not all PIDs 
are characterized by severe infectious diseases. Among those 
associated with severe infections, susceptibility can be global 
(i.e., to a wide variety of pathogens) or restricted to a small 
number of microorganisms, sometimes even a single patho‑
gen, for instance EBV (Casanova, 2015a,b).
Primary infection with EBV
, one of eight known 
human herpes viruses, typically occurs in childhood and is 
usually asymptomatic but can cause self‑limiting infectious 
mononucleosis during adolescence or adulthood (Taylor et 
al., 2015). Severe EBV‑associated diseases are seen in patients 
with three nonmutually exclusive groups of PIDs: those with 
broad defects in T cell immunity, familial forms of lympho‑
histiocytosis, and disorders of DNA repair (Faitelson and 
Grunebaum, 2014; Palendira and Rickinson, 2015; Taylor et 
al., 2015). In most of these conditions, EBV is only one of 
many microbial threats. However, selective susceptibility to 
EBV‑induced diseases is the main characteristic of patients 
suffering from X‑linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syn‑
drome caused by mutations in SH2D1A (Tangye, 2014) or 
BIRC4 (Aguilar and Latour, 2015). Affected males develop 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, hypogammaglobulin‑
emia, and/or lymphoid malignancy. Patients with mutations 
in ITK, MAGT1, CORO1A, FCGR3A, or CD27 are also 
vulnerable to EBV and occasionally other herpes viruses 
(Cohen, 2015; Taylor et al., 2015).
CD27, a TNF receptor superfamily member, is ex‑
pressed on human naive and some memory T cells, germinal 
center and memory B cells, plasma cells, and a subset of NK 
cells (Tangye et al., 1998; Jung et al., 2000; Borst et al., 2005; 
Silva et al., 2008; 
Vossen et al., 2008). Its specific ligand, CD70, 
a cytokine structurally related to TNF
, is only transiently ex‑
pressed on activated dendritic, 
T, and B cells (Lens et al., 1996; 
Tesselaar et al., 2003; Borst et al., 2005). Studies of mouse and 
human immune cells have implicated CD70–CD27 interac‑
tion in T cell expansion and survival, germinal center forma‑
tion, B cell activation and antibody production, and NK cell 
function (Hintzen et al., 1995; Jacquot et al., 1997; Agematsu 
et al., 1998; Borst et al., 2005; Nolte et al., 2009; De Colven‑
aer et al., 2011). Currently, 16 individuals with confirmed and 
one patient with potential biallelic‑null mutations in CD27 
have been reported (van Montfrans et al., 2012; Salzer et al., 
2013; Alkhairy et al., 2015a). They display EBV‑associated 
lymphoproliferative disease, lymphoma, and/or hypogamma‑
globulinemia. Here, we describe four patients from two unre‑
lated and ethnically distinct families with autosomal recessive 
CD70 deficiency causing a similar clinical phenotype.
rEsulTs
Four affected individuals from two unrelated 
consanguineous families with viral infections and 
EBV-associated malignancy
The proband from family 1 (P1) is a female born to Persian 
consanguineous parents. 
At 5 yr of age, she had severe chicken‑
pox infection with varicella pneumonia. At age 8, she suffered 
from Behçet’s‑like syndrome, with nonerosive oligoarthritis, 
oral aphthous ulcers, and posterior uveitis. At age 9, she had 
recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, hypogammaglob‑
ulinemia, and poor antibody responses to tetanus and diph‑
theria vaccinations but normal 
T and B cell numbers (Table 1 
and Fig. S1). Intravenous IgG (IVIG) replacement and pro‑
phylactic treatment with antibiotics reduced the frequency 
and severity of infections. She subsequently developed finger 
clubbing, mild restrictive and obstructive pulmonary func‑
tion, alopecia areata, peptic ulcer and gastritis, splenomegaly, 
and lymphadenopathy. At age 17, a gastric biopsy from an 
ulcerated lesion revealed mixed cellularity–type Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (HL) with strong expression of EBV nuclear anti‑
gen 1 (EBNA1). She achieved clinical remission after four cy‑
cles of chemotherapy. P1 has three healthy siblings; however, 
a fourth sibling (P2, IV
.3; Fig. 1 A) had encephalitis during 
infancy caused by an undefined central nervous system viral 
infection. Normal lymphocyte counts (Fig. S1) and serum Ig 
levels but low postvaccination antibody titers against tetanus 
and diphtheria were observed (Table S1). Anti‑EBV
, CMV
, 
HSV‑1, and varicella‑zoster IgG were present at high titers 
in P1 and P2 (Table 1 and Table S1), but neither EBV nor 
CMV were detected in plasma by PCR, suggesting disease 
remission. At the most recent follow up, P1 (age 29) was clin‑
ically stable on monthly IVIG and prophylactic antimicrobial 
therapy; P2 (age 33) was intellectually disabled but did not 
present with other clinical manifestations. The parents have 
no signs of immunodeficiency, but the father developed pros‑
tate cancer at the age of 53, and the mother was diagnosed 
with uterine cancer and astrocytoma at 53 and 60 yr of age, 
respectively (Fig. 1 A). The mother also had two unexplained 
miscarriages. Both maternal and paternal grandparents died 
from malignancies (II.1‑II.4; Fig. 1 A).
The proband from family 2 (P3), of 
Turkish consanguin‑
eous origin, had recurrent otitis media, frequent fever, and 
diarrhea starting at 1 yr of age. At 2.5 yr of age, he developed 
diffuse cervical lymphadenopathy. Excisional biopsy revealed 
mixed cellularity–type HL that was positive for EBV‑latent 
membrane protein 1. EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG 
was positive, and EBV DNA was detected in the blood. Ig

levels were reduced, but specific antibody responses were 
present (Table 1). Peripheral lymphocyte immunophenotyp‑
ing was normal except for a transient CD4+ T cell lymph‑
openia (Fig. S1). Although remission was achieved with six 
cycles of chemotherapy, relapse of HL occurred in the same 
region. Additional chemo/radiotherapy resulted in complete 
remission. As Ig levels remained low, IVIG and antimicrobial 
prophylaxis were started. After 9 yr of an uneventful clinical 
course, he had elevated EBV PCR copy numbers, which were 
responsive to rituximab treatment. He currently remains in 
complete remission at age 16. P3 has a brother (P4; Fig. 1 B) 
who was almost 3 yr old when he developed chronic cervical 
lymphadenopathy with an EBV‑associated mixed cellular HL. 
Serum EBV VCA IgG was positive, and EBV was also de‑
tected by PCR in his cerebrospinal fluid. He showed normal 
lymphocyte immunophenotyping but a history of recurrent 
upper respiratory tract infections and hypogammaglobulin‑
emia (Table 1 and Fig. S1), for which IVIG and antimicrobial 
prophylaxis were given. Although he entered remission after 
six cycles of chemotherapy, HL relapsed 2 yr later. Chemo‑
therapy was followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. Although he had an episode of posttransplant 
EBV flare up, he currently remains in complete remission 
(at age 8). The parents have no immunodeficiency, but the 
mother had breast cancer at the age of 35.
Homozygous frameshift or in-frame deletions in CD70 in 
the four affected individuals
In family 1, whole‑exome sequencing (WES) was performed 
for the index patient P1. As she was born to consanguine‑
ous parents, an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance was 
expected; nonsynonymous rare variations (minor allele fre‑
quency <1%) in a homozygous status were thus prioritized. 
Mutations in known PID genes (Picard et al., 2015) were 
not observed. However, a novel homozygous 1‑bp deletion in 
exon 3 of CD70 (c.250delT), predicted to change the reading 
frame at amino acid 84 and create a premature stop codon 
27 amino acids downstream of the mutation (p.S84Pfs27X), 
was detected. WES was also performed for P2, and the CD70 
mutation was the only candidate among the shared homozy‑
gous variants that could explain the immunodeficiency ob‑
served in both siblings. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the 
two siblings were homozygous and the parents and healthy 
siblings were heterozygous for this mutation (Fig. 1 C). This 
mutation was not found in the 1000 Genomes, National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute exome sequencing project, 
and Exome Aggregation Consortium databases or in 251 Ira‑
nian blood donors and our recent study of the Middle East‑
ern 
Variome (Scott et al., 2016). The mutation is predicted to 
be deleterious (for details, see the Genetic analysis section of 
Materials and methods).
In family 2, whole‑genome sequencing (WGS) was 
performed on the affected sibling (P4) and both parents. We 
used a similar strategy to family 1 for filtering and prioritiz‑
ing variants and identified a novel homozygous 3‑bp dele‑
tion (c.555_557delCTT), also located in exon 3 of CD70, 
predicted to be deleterious and cause an in‑frame deletion 
at position 186 (p.F186del). Sanger sequencing identified the 
same homozygous CD70 mutation in the proband (P3) and 
confirmed the homozygous mutation status in P4 and the 
heterozygous status of both parents (Fig. 1 D).
lack of expression or altered binding of 
the mutant CD70 protein
Quantitative PCR demonstrated normal CD70 mRNA 
levels in PBMCs from the two affected siblings in family 1, 
indicating minimal nonsense‑mediated mRNA decay (not 
depicted). Flow cytometric analysis showed that CD70 was 
absent from B cells from P1 or P2, and expression was re‑
duced to ∼50% of the normal value in the heterozygous fa‑
ther (Fig. 2 A). Western blotting of HEK293 cells transfected 
with WT or mutant (p.S84Pfs27X) CD70 was performed

using two different antibodies recognizing distinct epitopes 
of CD70 (Ab1 and Ab2; Fig. 1 E and Fig. 2 B). Neither full‑
length nor truncated forms of mutant CD70 were detected, 
confirming that the patients’ CD70 allele is a loss‑of‑expres‑
sion variant (Fig. 2 B).
In family 2, the CD70 mutation caused the loss of the 
first of two phenylalanines, nine amino acids distant from 
the C terminus. This residue is predicted to contribute to a 
β‑strand conserved among the TNF superfamily to which 
CD70 belongs (Goodwin et al., 1993; T
esselaar et al., 1997). 
T
o test the effect of this mutation on the structure and func‑
tion of CD70, we first assessed CD70 expression. Using a 
mAb against the extracellular C‑terminal portion of CD70, 
we could detect expression on activated CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells from healthy controls and heterozygous parents, but 
this mAb did not readily detect expression from P3 and P4 
(Fig. 2, C and D; and not depicted). In contrast, the same pa‑
tients’ cells showed normal levels of CD70 proteins by West‑
ern blotting using a polyclonal antibody encompassing and 
extending upstream from the C terminus (Ab3; Fig. 1 E and 
Fig. 2 E). Next, we tested whether the mutation altered the 
structure of CD70 sufficiently to impair receptor–ligand in‑
teractions. Besides altered epitope binding by Abs, we found 
no binding of soluble recombinant CD27‑Fc to HEK293T 
cells overexpressing mutant versus WT CD70 (Fig. 2 F). This 
signal was specific for CD27 as shown by lack of binding to 
anti‑CD5 in WT CD70‑transfected cells. The mutant CD70 
was expressed to near‑equal levels as WT CD70 on trans‑

(A) Expression of CD70 by peripheral blood B cells from 
the CD70-deficient patients (P1 and P2), compared with

CD70 expression was analyzed on CD19+-gated, live, 
single B cells. (B) Immunoblotting analysis of CD70 WT 
and mutant (identified in family 1) transfected HEK 293 
cells. CD70 expression was probed with two different Abs

served as a loading control. (C–E) Expression of CD70 by 
activated peripheral blood T cells from the two homozy-
gous CD70-mutant patients (P3 and P4), compared with 
heterozygous parents (n = 2) and normal controls (n =

CD3+ gated, live, single T cells using a mAb raised against 
CD70-transfected L cells (C and D) or by immunoblotting 
using polyclonal Abs (Ab3) raised against an extended 
C-terminal portion of CD70 (E). HSP90 was used to as-
sess protein loading. (F) Binding of overexpressed WT or 
mutant CD70 to recombinant human CD27 was evaluated 
by flow cytometry. Shaded areas represent nontransfected

fected cells (Fig. 2, G and H; and not depicted). T
ogether, 
these data indicate that the mutant CD70 identified in P3 and 
P4, though expressed, is a loss‑of‑function variant because of 
impaired binding to its natural receptor CD27.
reduced memory B and T cells in CD70-deficient individuals
Although frequencies of B cells and CD8+ 
T cells were largely 
normal in CD70‑deficient patients, there were mild reduc‑
tions in proportions of CD4+ T cells (Table 2). Further analy‑
sis revealed increased frequencies of naive CD4+ and CD8+ 
T and B cells and corresponding decreases in memory T cell 
subsets and total and switched memory B cells (Table 2). Ex‑
pression of activation and differentiation molecules such as 
CD27, CD57, CD95, and KLRG1 on memory CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells, as well as proportions of regulatory T cells and 
circulating T follicular helper cells, were comparable between 
patients and controls (Table 2 and not depicted). In contrast, 
relative expression levels of 2B4 (CD244) or NKG2D, two 
activating receptors implicated in CD8+ T cell–mediated 
control of EBV‑infected B cells (Hislop et al., 2010; Palendira 
et al., 2011; Chaigne‑Delalande et al., 2013), were reduced 
or absent, respectively, on central memory T (TCM; CCR7+ 
CD45RA−), effector memory T (TEM; CCR7−CD45RA−), 
and terminally differentiated effector memory T (TEMRA; 
CCR7−CD45RA+) cell subsets of CD8+ T cells from all 
CD70‑deficient patients compared with healthy controls 
(Fig. 3, A and B). Partial defects in 2B4 and NKG2D ex‑
pression were also observed for heterozygous carriers (Fig. 3, 
A and B). Proportions of NK cells and NK subsets in the 
CD70‑deficient patients were variable but largely compa‑
rable with healthy controls (Table 2). Thus, although global 
lymphocyte differentiation in vivo was relatively unaffected 
by the absence of functional CD70, the maintenance or per‑
sistence of memory T and B cells and acquisition of 2B4 and 
NKG2D by memory CD8+ T cells were compromised.
Altered phenotype of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells in 
CD70-deficient individuals
Next, we investigated whether EBV‑specific CD8+ T cells 
were present in the CD70‑deficient individuals. PBMCs 
from P1 and P2 (family 1; both HLA‑A*24+) and HLA‑
matched and ‑mismatched controls were stained ex vivo with 
HLA‑A*2402–RYS 
IFF 
DY tetramers (EBNA3A, residues 
246–253). Comparable frequencies of EBV‑specific CD8+ T 
cells were identified in CD70‑deficient individuals, hetero‑
zygous family members, and healthy HLA‑matched controls 
(0.2–0.5% of CD8+ T cells; Fig. 3 C). The proportions of 
EBV‑specific CD8+ T cells detected in P3 and P4 (family 2;

tetramer (EBNA3B, residues 399–408) approximated those 
in HLA‑mismatched controls (∼0.2% vs. 0.5–1.0% of CD8+ 
T cells in healthy HLA‑matched controls and heterozygous 
family members), suggesting a negligible EBV‑specific re‑
sponse in these individuals (Fig. 3 C). Next, we determined 
the differentiation status of EBV‑specific CD8+ T cells in 
family 1. As previously described (Callan et al., 1998; His‑
lop et al., 2002), most EBV‑specific CD8+ T cells in healthy 
donors are TEM cells, with the remainder corresponding to 
TCM and TEMRA subsets. Intriguingly, most EBV‑specific 
CD8+ 
T cells in CD70‑deficient individuals exhibited a naive 
(CCR7+CD45RA+) or TCM cell–like phenotype. Although 
EBV‑specific TEM cells were detected in these patients, they 
persisted at lower frequencies than controls (Fig. 3 D). Sim‑
ilar to total memory CD8+ T cells, CD27, CD57, KLRG1, 
CD95, and PD‑1 were expressed to comparable levels on 
EBV‑specific CD8+ T cells from CD70‑deficient individ‑
uals and controls. Importantly, proportions of EBV‑specific 
CD8+ T cells expressing 2B4 or NKG2D were reduced in 
the CD70‑deficient individuals (Fig. 3 E). Moreover, coex‑
pression patterns differed among CD70‑deficient individu‑
als, heterozygous relatives, and controls. Most T cells in P1 
did not coexpress any of these markers, whereas T cells from 
P2 predominantly expressed PD‑1 (Fig. 3, F and G). Overall, 
these results suggested that though there is no indication of 
T cell exhaustion in CD70 deficiency, the phenotype and 
function of EBV‑specific CD8+ T cells is nonetheless al‑
tered, with reduced frequencies of TEM cells and reduced ex‑
pression of 2B4 and NKG2D.
CD70 deficiency impairs cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells 
against EBV–B cell targets
Next, we addressed the consequences of CD70 deficiency 
on lymphocyte function. Proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells induced by in vitro stimulation of PBMCs with 
PHA/IL‑2, PMA/ionomycin, or immobilized mAbs specific 
for CD2, CD3, and CD28 was unaffected by CD70 defi‑
ciency (Fig. 4 A). Lysis of K562 or 721.211 target cells by 
IL‑2–stimulated NK cells from CD70‑deficient patients was 
normal (P1 and P2) or only modestly reduced (P3 and P4) 
compared with those from healthy controls (not depicted). 
Thus, CD70 deficiency has minimal if any effect on the de‑
velopment, differentiation, and function of human NK cells. 
However, EBV‑specific CD8+ T cells from CD70‑deficient 
patients, expanded by co‑culturing with irradiated autologous 
EBV‑transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), exhib‑
ited defective cytotoxic activity against EBV‑LCL (Fig. 4 B). 
T
o determine at which stage of CD8+ T cell activation and 
differentiation the CD27–CD70 interaction was critical, we 
tested the effect of CD70 blockade on responses of T cells 
or clones from healthy donors to autologous EBV‑LCL. 
Up‑regulation of CD25 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells by co‑culture with EBV‑LCL was reduced in the pres‑
ence of a blocking anti‑CD70 mAb (Fig. 4 C). Although the 
proportion of CD8+ T cells induced to express NKG2D was 
not affected by CD70 blockade, its level of expression was 
significantly reduced (Fig. 4 C). Consistent with these find‑
ings, up‑regulation of CD25 on T cells from CD70‑deficient 
patients was impaired after a 4‑d culture with autologous 
EBV‑LCL cells (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, blocking CD27–CD70 
interactions did not affect the cytotoxicity of antigen‑specific 
 97
JEM Vol. 214, No. 1
CD8+ T cell clones against autologous EBV‑LCL presenting 
specific peptides (Fig. 4 E). Thus, CD27–CD70 interactions 
are required for the initial priming of antigen‑specific T cells 
but not for their subsequent effector function.
DIsCussION
We have identified four patients from two unrelated kindreds 
with autosomal recessive CD70 deficiency. Their clinical and 
immunological features bear similarities to CD27‑deficient 
patients (Table 3). Both groups are prone to hypogamma‑
globulinemia, EBV‑induced disease including lymphoprolif‑
eration and lymphoma, and additional viral infections. One 
of the four CD70‑deficient patients had alopecia areata and 
features of Behçet’s syndrome. Interestingly, Behçet’s syn‑
drome can be mimicked by EBV‑induced uveitis and oral/
perianal ulcers, as previously reported for CD27‑deficient 
patients (Alkhairy et al., 2015a). The immunological pheno‑
type of CD27‑ or CD70‑deficient patients includes largely 
normal counts of T, B, and NK cells but reduced proportions 
of memory B cells. Although some patients with CD27 (van 
Montfrans et al., 2012; Salzer et al., 2013) or CD70 mutations 
may generate EBV‑specific CD8+ T cells, the nature of the 
EBV‑specific CD8+ T cells was aberrant, indicated by im‑
paired cytotoxic responses to EBV
, poor expression of 2B4 
and NKG2D (CD70 deficiency), or reduced production of 
IL‑2 (CD27 deficiency; van Montfrans et al., 2012). Likewise, 
a subset of CD27‑ or CD70‑deficient patients exhibited vari‑
ably reduced NK cell function. These experiments of nature 
indicate that CD27 and CD70 serve as each other’s essen‑
tial counter structures.
All CD70‑deficient individuals are clinically stable 
(range in age from 8 to 33 yr), whereas CD27 deficiency 
showed a high rate of mortality (29%; death reported between 
2 and 25 yr of age, mainly related to malignancies and infec‑

The proportions and phenotype of the indicated lymphocyte subsets were determined as detailed in the B, T, and NK cell phenotyping section of Materials and methods. Subsets of 
cells were defined as follows: naive (CD45RA+CCR7+CD95−), stem cell memory (CD45RA+CCR7+CD95+), central memory (CD45RA−CCR7+), effector memory (CD45RA−CCR7−), and TEMRA 
(CD45RA+CCR7−) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25hiCD127lo); T follicular cells (Tfh; CD4+CD45RA−CXCR5+); transitional (CD20+CD10+CD27−), naive (CD20+CD10−CD27−), 
and memory (CD20+CD10−CD27+) B cells; and class switched memory B cells (CD20+CD10−CD27+IgM−IgD−). Values from patients that are above or below two SDs of average value of 
controls are in bold.

text of the primary viral infection—time, location, type, and 
initial viral load—influences the onset and severity of other 
clinical/immunological phenotypes. Other genetic modifiers 
could also interact with environmental factors and, together, 
account for incomplete penetrance of each viral phenotype 
and variable expressivity of both conditions.
The CD27–CD70 interaction has been shown to be 
important for B cell activation, plasma cell generation, and 
Ig production in vitro (Agematsu et al., 1995, 1999; Jacquot 
et al., 1997; Borst et al., 2005). Consistent with this notion, 
all CD70‑deficient and 70% of CD27‑deficient patients had 
hypogammaglobulinemia, poor Ab responses to vaccinations, 
and/or a reduced percentage of switched memory B cells. 
Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the antibody defect 
in CD27 or CD70 deficiency results from defective terminal 
B cell differentiation and/or lack of T cell help or is caused 
by EBV or other viral infections. In several CD27‑deficient 
patients, serum Ig levels were normal or high initially but 
declined dramatically in the months after documented EBV 
infection. 
This suggests that hypogammaglobulinemia in these 
patients may be secondary or facilitated by the underlying 
genetic defect, as seen in some cases of XLP syndrome (van 
Montfrans et al., 2012; Salzer et al., 2013; Tangye, 2014).
CD27–CD70 co‑stimulation is not critical for T cell 
development but is involved in peripheral T cell priming and 
effector functions (Hintzen et al., 1995; Borst et al., 2005). 
CD27−/− mice show impaired CD4+ and CD8+ T cell prim‑
ing and T cell memory generation against influenza (Hen‑
driks et al., 2000, 2003). CD70−/− mice have robust cytokine 
responses during early stages of mouse CMV infection, lead‑
ing to initial control of viral load; however, they fail to gener‑
ate an optimal virus‑specific cytotoxic T cell response (Allam 
et al., 2014). The establishment of memory CD8+ T cells and 
the ability to mount a recall response to LCMV are, however, 
normal in these mice (Munitic et al., 2013). Furthermore, 
CD4+ T cell responses are essentially intact in CD70−/− mice 
(Munitic et al., 2013). IL‑2–producing EBV‑specific CD8+ 
T cells were shown to be reduced in one CD27‑deficient 
patient (van Montfrans et al., 2012), whereas EBV‑specific 
CD8+ T cells from CD70‑deficient patients exhibited a naive 
phenotype or were below the limit of detection. Moreover, 
expression of 2B4 and NKG2D on memory and EBV‑ 
specific CD8+ T cells was reduced in CD70‑deficient indi‑
viduals. Impaired signaling through 2B4, a SLAM (signaling 
lymphocytic activation molecule) family member that re‑
cruits SAP (SLAM‑associated protein), underlies defective 
cytolytic responses to EBV infection in SAP‑deficient XLP 
patients (Hislop et al., 2010; Palendira et al., 2011; Waggoner 
and Kumar, 2012). Similarly, mutations in MAGT1, causing 
X‑linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, EBV 
infection, and neoplasia disease, abrogate up‑regulation of 
NKG2D on NK and CD8+ T cells, thereby compromis‑

ing their ability to lyse EBV‑infected target cells (Chaigne‑
Delalande et al., 2013). As these studies revealed critical roles 
for 2B4 and NKG2D in cytotoxic lymphocyte‑mediated 
control of EBV infection, impaired expression of these re‑
ceptors on memory CD8+ T cells in CD70‑deficient pa‑
tients is consistent with the compromised cytotoxic T cell 
responses against EBV‑infected cells that were also observed. 
These findings provide a mechanistic explanation of how 
pathogenic mutations in distinct signaling pathways converge 
to yield a common clinical phenotype. As co‑engagement 
of 2B4 and NKG2D on human NK cells synergize to yield 
greater cytotoxicity than engagement of either receptor alone 
(Bryceson et al., 2009; Kwon et al., 2016), it is possible that 
the combinatorial effect of concomitant signaling via both of 
these receptors on CD8+ T cells will also be affected by their 
diminished expression in the absence of CD70. It is highly 
likely that parallel defects underlie susceptibility to EBV‑ 
induced disease in individuals with biallelic mutations in CD27.
In conclusion, we have defined a novel PID resulting 
from CD70 deficiency characterized by increased susceptibil‑
ity to EBV‑induced disease as well as impairments in T and 
B cell differentiation, culminating in reduced immunologi‑
cal memory. These findings complement the clinical features 
of CD27 deficiency and underscore the critical function of 
CD27/CD70 signaling in regulating humoral and cell‑me‑
diated immunity in humans, especially for control of EBV
. 
Overexpression of CD70 has been observed in several au‑
toimmune disorders (Han et al., 2016) and various tumors 
(Jacobs et al., 2015). Immunotherapy targeting the CD27–
CD70 axis has therefore been developed and tested in clini‑
cal trials (Jacobs et al., 2015). However, frequently occurring 
deleterious somatic mutations or large deletions in the CD70 
gene have recently been described in diffuse large B cell or 
Burkitt’s lymphomas (Scholtysik et al., 2012; de Miranda et al., 
2014). Our discovery and characterization of CD70‑deficient 
individuals provide further insight into the role of CD27/
CD70 in autoimmunity and antitumor response and will re‑
fine the targeted therapies to the corresponding diseases. In 
addition, patients receiving Abs blocking CD27–CD70 inter‑
action should be monitored for EBV‑induced malignancies.
MATErIAls AND METHODs
Case studies
The proband from the first family (P1) is a female born to 
Persian consanguineous parents living in Iran. She was ad‑
mitted to the hospital at the age of 5 yr because of severe 
chicken pox infection, which led to varicella pneumonia. At 
the age of 8 yr, she was seen as an outpatient with symptoms 
suggestive of Behçet’s syndrome, including arthralgia of the 
knee caused by nonerosive oligoarthritis, oral aphthous ulcers, 
and posterior uveitis. Administration of oral prednisolone im‑
proved her condition. At age 9, the patient was hospitalized 
for immunological evaluation because of recurrent upper 
respiratory tract infections including otitis media and sinus‑
itis. Hypogammaglobulinemia and poor antibody responses 
to tetanus and diphtheria vaccinations, but normal T and B 
lymphocyte counts, were documented. IVIG replacement 
and prophylactic treatment with antibiotics reduced the fre‑
quency and severity of the infectious episodes. Despite regu‑
lar follow‑up, she developed finger clubbing, mild restrictive 
and obstructive pulmonary function (assessed by spirometry 
at age 10), alopecia areata (at age 11), peptic ulcer and gas‑
tritis, and splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy (at age 17). A 
diagnosis of mixed cellularity–type HL was made, compatible 
with stage IIIE,S. Gastric biopsies from an ulcerated lesion in 
the lesser gastric curve were also taken during this admission, 
revealing HL‑associated lymphohistiocytic infiltration. DNA 
prepared from a gastric HL biopsy showed a strong EBV+ sig‑
nal, as determined by EBNA1 gene amplification, suggestive 
of EBV‑driven lymphomagenesis. She responded well to four 
cycles of chemotherapy (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, 
and dacarbazine) and achieved clinical remission. Antibodies 
(IgG) against EBV (EBNA), CMV
, HSV‑1, and varicella zos‑
ter virus were present at high titers, but no EBV or CMV 
genes were detected by PCR in the plasma, suggesting remis‑
sion of the disease. At her most recent clinical follow‑up at 
age 29 yr, her clinical condition was stable on monthly IVIG 
and prophylactic antimicrobial therapy.
P1 has four siblings, three of whom are healthy. The 
fourth sibling (P2) had encephalitis during infancy, which led 
to mental retardation. The encephalitis was likely caused by 
an undefined central nervous system viral infection, as bacte‑
rial infections and other causes of acute encephalopathy were 
excluded. Normal lymphocyte counts and normal serum 
Ig levels but low antibody titers against tetanus and diph‑
theria in spite of vaccination were observed. His antibody 
(IgG) titers against EBV
, CMV
, HSV‑1, and varicella zoster 
virus were also high, but no active infections were detected 
by PCR. At the most recent follow up at age 33 yr, he was 
intellectually disabled (IQ‑based score 64) but did not present 
with other clinical manifestations. Both maternal and pater‑
nal grandparents died from malignancies. 
The parents have no 
signs of immunodeficiency, but the father developed prostate 
cancer at the age of 53 and the mother had uterine cancer 
(mixed serous‑endometrial carcinoma) and astrocytoma at 
53 and 60 yr of age, respectively. The mother also had two 
unexplained miscarriages.
The proband from the second consanguineous family 
(P3), of Turkish origin, had recurrent otitis media, frequent 
fever, and diarrhea episodes starting at 1 yr of age. He was 
2.5 yr old when he developed diffuse cervical lymphade‑
nopathy. Excisional biopsy revealed mixed cellularity–type 
HL that was EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) an‑
tigen positive. EBV VCA IgG was positive, and EBV PCR 
detected 5,726 copies/ml in blood. Reduced Ig levels were 
detected at the HL diagnosis, but specific antibody responses 
were present. Peripheral lymphocyte immunophenotyping 
was normal except for CD4+ T cell lymphopenia that later 
resolved. Although remission was achieved with two cycles 
of OPPA (vincristine [Oncovin], procarbazine, prednisone, 
 Human CD70 deficiency | Abolhassani et al.
102
and doxorubicin [Adriamycin]) and four cycles of COPP 
(cyclophosphamide, vincristine [Oncovin], procarbazine, 
and prednisone), relapse of HL occurred in the same region. 
Three cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin [Adriamycin], bleomy‑
cin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and 2,000‑cGy radiotherapy 
resulted in complete remission. Ig levels were still low; thus, 
IVIG and antimicrobial prophylaxis were started. After 9 yr 
of an uneventful clinical course, he had elevated EBV PCR 
copy numbers, which were unresponsive to acyclovir treat‑
ment but became negative after two doses of rituximab. He 
currently remains in complete remission at age 16 years with‑
out PCR‑detectable EBV or CMV in blood.
P3 has a brother (P4) who was almost 3 yr old when 
he also developed chronic cervical lymphadenopathy with 
EBV‑associated mixed cellular HL. EBV 
VCA IgG was posi‑
tive in blood; EBV was also detected by PCR in his cerebro‑
spinal fluid. He had a history of recurrent upper respiratory 
infections. Similar to his brother, he had normal lympho‑
cyte immunophenotyping but hypogammaglobulinemia, for 
which IVIG and antimicrobial prophylaxis were given. Al‑
though he entered remission after six cycles of ABVD, relapse 
of the tumor occurred 2 yr later. Histopathologic examination 
showed positive EBV LMP1 and CD30 consistent with HL. 
Six cycles of gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and brentuximab were 
followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplanta‑
tion. Although he had an episode of posttransplant EBV flare 
up, he currently also remains in complete remission, without 
PCR‑detectable EBV or CMV in blood.
Clinical evaluation
Written informed consent was obtained from the patients and 
their relatives or the healthy normal donors. Approvals for this 
study were obtained from human research ethics committees 
at St. Vincent’s Hospital and Sydney South West Area Health 
Service, the ethics committees or the Institutional Review 
Boards of the Karolinska Institutet, the T
ehran University of 
Medical Sciences, Ankara University, and the National Insti‑
tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of 
Health. An evaluation sheet was used to summarize demo‑
graphic information of patients including gender, ethnicity, 
place and date of birth, medical history including the date of 
PID diagnosis and record of other diseases, clinical manifesta‑
tions, relevant laboratory tests, and family history.
Genetic analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using the 
DNeasy Tissue and Blood kit or from formalin‑fixed par‑
affin‑embedded tissue using the GeneRead DNA for‑
malin‑fixed paraffin‑embedded kit (QIA 
GEN). WES was 
performed for P1 and P2 on a HiSeq2000 platform (Illu‑
mina), and the process of library preparation, read mapping, 
and variant analysis has been previously described (Abolhas‑
sani et al., 2014; Alkhairy et al., 2015b). For family 2, WGS 
were performed for P4 (60× mean coverage) and both 
parents (30× mean coverage) using 300 ng genomic DNA 
(Broad Institute). Single‑nucleotide variant and insertion/
deletion calling were performed using the Genome Analy‑
sis T
oolkit (3.4). Existing databases including 1000 Genome, 
Exome Aggregation Consortium, National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute exome variant server, and Greater Middle 
East Variome were used for filtering based on the popula‑
tion frequency for any given variant for both families. CD70 
has a gene damage index of 1.78 and a mutation significance 
cut‑off of 6.208 (Itan et al., 2015, 2016). The combined an‑
notation‑dependent depletion scores (Kircher et al., 2014) for 
the CD70 variants identified in the two families are 23.7 and 
8.053 (both above the gene‑specific mutation significance 
cut‑off) and are thus predicted to be deleterious. WES and 
WGS data have been deposited in the Database of Genotypes 
and Phenotypes under accession no. phs001245.v1.p1.
Sanger sequencing was conducted to confirm the pres‑
ence of the CD70 mutation in the affected siblings and for 
carrier detection in family 1. Exon 3 of the CD70 gene was 
PCR amplified (forward, 5′‑CCT

at Macrogen Inc. Sequence analysis was performed using the 
Lasergene software package (DNAStar). The same method 
was applied to investigate the mutation prevalence in this 
exon in 251 Iranian blood donors. A nested PCR approach 
was used to amplify EBNA1 from DNA from tumor biopsy 
(Cinque et al., 1993; Chan et al., 2001). For variants from 
family 2, genomic DNA from both affected siblings and par‑
ents was PCR amplified (forward primer, 5′‑GGC

rNA isolation and quantitative PCr
PBMCs were isolated from whole blood by a standard 
method (Hypaque‑Ficoll; GE Healthcare). T
otal RNA was 
isolated from PBMCs using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIA 
GEN). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 
0.5 µg of total RNA using a First‑strand cDNA synthesis 
kit (GE Healthcare). Expression level of CD70 was measured 
by quantitative PCR (forward, 5′‑GTG

Protein expression analysis of the CD70 
mutant identified in family 1
T
otal RNA was extracted from PBMCs from a healthy vol‑
unteer, transcribed into cDNA, and used to amplify the cod‑
ing region of WT CD70 (forward, 5′‑TGC

3′). The amplified region was ligated into a pcDNA 3.1B 
mammalian expression vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
The 
CD70 mutation identified in family 1 was generated using 
 103
JEM Vol. 214, No. 1
the CHA 
NGE‑IT site‑directed mutagenesis kit (Affymetrix). 
HEK293 cells were transfected with 3 µg of the CD70 WT 
or mutant plasmids or 3 µg of empty pcDNA vector (mock 
control) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scien‑
tific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 µg of a 
GFP construct was cotransfected to estimate the transfection 
efficiency. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection.
Expression of CD70 on B and T cells was evaluated by 
flow cytometry (anti‑CD70, clone 113‑16, BioLegend; anti‑ 
CD19 BV711, clone SJ25C1, BD; and anti‑CD3 FITC, 
clone HIT3a, BioLegend). T cells were activated with beads 
coated with anti‑CD3, anti‑CD28, and anti‑CD2 antibodies 
(Miltenyi Biotec) for 3 d and cultured with 100 U/ml recom‑
binant human IL‑2 (rhIL‑2) for up to 22 d before analysis. 
Protein expression in transfected HEK293 cells was analyzed 
by Western blotting. CD70 expression was detected with two 
different antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing 
amino acids 61–75 of the WT protein (Sigma‑Aldrich) and 
a mouse mAb recognizing amino acids 45–193 (R&D Sys‑
tems). Successful transfection was monitored by GFP expres‑
sion (Cell Signaling T
echnology), and expression of β‑actin 
(Cell Signaling T
echnology) served as a loading control.
Expression and functional analysis of the CD70 
mutant identified in family 2
Endogenous protein expression in proliferating T cells was 
analyzed by immunoblotting. CD70 expression was detected 
using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab96323) raised against 
amino acids 129–193 (Abcam). Expression of HSP90 (BD) 
served as a loading control. Human CD70 cDNA cloned in 
the pCMV6 entry vector was purchased from OriGene (no. 
RC200410). The c.555‑557delCTT mutant was generated 
by site‑directed mutagenesis. Full‑length CD70 plasmid was 
PCR amplified using AccuPrime Pfx SuperMix (Invitrogen) 
with the primer pair containing the CTT deletion (forward,

HEK293T cells (ATCC) were transfected with 4 µg 
WT 
or mutant CD70 plasmids using Turbofect reagent (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed 
with PBS, incubated with 10 mM EDTA/PBS to make a 
single‑cell suspension, and resuspended at 0.5 × 106/ml in 
staining buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mM 
potassium chloride, 150 mM sodium chloride, 5% glycerol, 
0.2% BSA, and 0.04% sodium azide). Cells were preincubated 
with 6 µg of human IgG (Grifols) for 15 min at 4°C to block 
nonspecific binding, followed by addition of 1 µg of either 
biotinylated CD27‑μIg (Ancell) or biotinylated anti–human 
CD5 mAb (PharMingen) for 30 min at 4°C; bound CD27‑Fc/
mAb was detected with PE‑conjugated streptavidin (Ancell). 
Flow cytometric analysis was performed using FlowJo soft‑
ware (Tree Star). For evaluation of cell surface expression of 
WT or mutant CD70 in transfected cells, single‑cell suspen‑
sions were incubated with PE–anti‑CD70 (clone 113‑16; Bi‑
oLegend) or anti‑flag M2 antibody (Sigma‑Aldrich) followed 
by PE–anti–mouse IgG1 secondary antibody (BioLegend). 
CD70 expression was also evaluated by immunoblotting as 
mentioned in the previous paragraph, with the following 
modifications. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation 
assay lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris‑HCl, pH 8, 
1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Nonidet‑P40) supplemented with 
complete protease inhibitor (Roche), with 20 µg of total pro‑
tein run per lane. CD70 expression was detected using rabbit 
polyclonal anti‑CD70 (C2745; Sigma‑Aldrich) or anti‑myc 
(C3956; Sigma‑Aldrich) antibodies.
Cell proliferation assay
PBMCs were thawed and resuspended in sterile PBS/0.1% 
BSA containing CFSE (eBioscience) at a final concentration 
of 2.5 µM. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 10 min and 
then washed with five volumes of ice‑cold sterile PBS/0.1% 
BSA and subsequently plated at ∼1.8 × 105 per well in 96‑
well U‑bottom plates containing either RPMI medium/10% 
FCS alone or 5 µg/ml PHA (Sigma‑Aldrich) plus 50 U/ml 
IL‑2 (PeproT
ech), 20 ng/ml PMA plus ionomycin (Sigma‑ 
Aldrich), or T cell activation and expansion beads (one bead 
to two cells; Miltenyi Biotec) for 4–5 d. Cells were harvested, 
stained with Zombie aqua fixable viability dye, anti‑CD3 Pa‑
cific blue, anti‑CD8 APC Cy7 (BioLegend), and anti‑CD4 
BUV395 (BD), fixed, and run on a cell analyzer (LSR 
II SORP; 
BD). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
B, T, and NK cell phenotyping
PBMCs from healthy controls (n = 5–11), heterozygous car‑
riers (n = 2–5), and homozygous CD70‑deficient patients 
were labeled with mAb against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, and 
CD16/56 to determine the proportions of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, 
B, and NK cells within the total lymphocyte population. Sub‑
sets of these cells were further enumerated by labeling with 
respective mAbs. The Abs used were: BUV395–anti‑CD20, 
APC–anti‑CD10, PECy7–anti‑CD27, PE–anti‑IgM, PerCP 
Cy5.5‑streptavidin (BD), and biotinylated anti‑IgD mAbs 
(SouthernBiotech) or APC Cy7–anti‑CD4, Alexa Fluor 647–
anti‑CXCR5, PerCP Cy5.5–anti‑CD127, PE Cy7–anti‑ 
CD25 (BD), and FITC–anti‑CD45RA mAbs (BioLegend), 
anti‑CD3 BV421, anti‑CD57 FITC, anti‑CD94 APC, anti‑ 
CD27 BV786, anti‑NKp30 PE, anti‑NKp44 Alexa Fluor 647, 
anti‑NKp46 (BD), anti‑CD56 BV605, anti‑CD16 APC Cy7 
(BioLegend), anti‑2B4 PE, anti–PD‑1 biotin, anti‑NKG2D 
PerCP eFluor 710, anti‑CD3 biotin, streptavidin‑PE Cy7 
(eBioscience), anti‑KLRG1 APC (Miltenyi Biotec), and anti–
NK‑T
‑B antigen (R&D Systems).
The typing for HLA‑A, ‑B, and ‑C was performed 
using the low‑resolution kits from Olerup SSP
. One million 
PBMCs from CD70‑deficient individuals and HLA‑matched 
and ‑mismatched controls were stained with 20 µg/ml 
BV421‑conjugated tetramer for 20 min at 37°C as previously 
described (Price et al., 2005). The EBV epitopes used were 
HLA‑A*1101–AVF 
DRK 
SDAK (EBNA3B, residues 399–
 Human CD70 deficiency | Abolhassani et al.
104
408) and HLA‑A*2402–RYS 
IFF 
DY (EBNA3A, residues 
246–253). Cells were subsequently stained with APC Cy7–
anti‑CD8α, PE Cy7–anti‑CCR7 (BioLegend), BUV395–
anti‑CD4, BV605–anti‑CD45RA, PE CF594–anti‑CD95, 
BV711‑streptavidin, 
PE–anti‑CD160, 
FITC–anti‑CD57 
(BD), PE–anti‑2B4, PerCP eFluor 710–anti‑NKG2D, and bi‑
otinylated anti–PD‑1 mAbs (eBioscience). Data were acquired 
on a cell analyzer (LSR II SORP) and analyzed using FlowJo 
software. Based on Boolean gating analysis, coexpression was 
determined using SPI 
CE software (Roederer et al., 2011).
Cytotoxic T and NK cell killing assay
For the generation of EBV‑transformed LCLs, PBMCs were 
infected with EBV‑containing supernatant from the B95‑8 
cell line (a gift from J. Cohen, National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, 
MD) in RPMI medium containing 20% FBS (Hyclone), 
2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (In‑
vitrogen), 55 µM 2‑mercaptoethanol (2‑ME; Sigma‑Aldrich), 
and 0.2 µg/ml cyclosporine A. Cells were cultured at 37°C 
for 3–4 wk for emergence of transformed B cells.
EBV‑specific CTLs were generated from PBMCs 
of patients or controls as previously described (Chaigne‑
Delalande et al., 2013). In brief, PBMCs were cultured in 
RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% 
FBS (Hyclone), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 
streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 55 µM 2‑ME with 40‑Gy 
γ‑irradiated autologous EBV‑LCLs, in the presence of 10 
ng/ml rhIL‑7 (PeproTech) and 10 pg/ml rhIL‑12 (R&D 
Systems; PeproTech). In some cases, PBMCs were first de‑
pleted of NK cells by CD56 microbead selection (Miltenyi 
Biotec). An effector to stimulator ratio of 20:1 or 40:1 was 
used. After 10 d, 20 U/ml of rhIL‑2 (Proleukin) was added 
to the medium. Repeated stimulations of EBV‑specific 
CTLs were performed every 7–10 d using γ‑irradiated au‑
tologous EBV‑LCL cells at a ratio of 4:1. CTLs after the 
third restimulation cycle were used in cytotoxicity assays 
against autologous EBV‑LCLs.
NK cells were isolated from PBMCs using CD56+‑ 
positive selection (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were stimulated 
with 100 U/ml rhIL‑2 (Proleukin) in IMDM containing 
10% human AB serum (CellGenix), 2 mM glutamine, 100 
U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 55 µM 
2‑ME. NK cells for up to 10 d of culture were used in cyto‑
toxicity assays against either the K562 or 721.221 cell lines.
NK cell and CTL cytotoxicity were measured using 
the GranToxilux Plus kit (OncoImmunin, Inc.) according 
to the manufacturer instructions. Target cells were loaded 
with 1:3,000 or 1:4,000 TFL4 dye for 1–20 min at 37°C, 
washed twice in PBS, and plated with effector cells. NK 
cells and CTLs were plated at an effector/target ratio 
from 0.5:1 to 5:1 and 2:1 to 20:1, respectively, in the pres‑
ence of the granzyme B substrate. After 1 h of incuba‑
tion, cytotoxicity was measured using FAC 
SVerse or FAC 
SCanto flow cytometers (BD).
CD70 blockade of EBV-specific CTl activation
PBMCs from normal healthy donors were cultured with 
irradiated autologous EBV‑LCLs (as described in the Cy‑
totoxic T and NK cell killing assay section). Anti–human 
CD70 antibody (clone 113‑16; BioLegend) or mouse IgG1 
isotype control antibody (clone MOPC‑21; BioLegend) was 
added to the culture medium (2.5–10 µg/ml). After 4–5 d 
of culture, cells were stained with anti–human CD3 (clone 
HIT3a), CD4 (clone A161A1), CD8 (clone HIT8a), CD25 
(clone BC96), and NKG2D (clone 1D11; BioLegend). Cell‑ 
surface expression was detected using FAC 
SCanto or Fortessa 
flow cytometers (BD). CD8+ T cell clones specific for ei‑
ther EBV or influenza were generated from healthy donors 
as previously described (Palendira et al., 2011), expanded 
on feeder cells (irradiated allogeneic PBMCs plus autolo‑
gous EBV‑transformed B cell lines presenting specific pep‑
tides) for 7–10 d, and then used in cytotoxicity assays. In 
brief, CD8+ T cell clones were incubated with EBV‑LCLs 
that were either unpulsed or pulsed with 1 µg/ml of spe‑
cific antigenic peptides in the absence or presence of blocking 
 
anti‑CD70 mAb. After 6 h, expression of CD107a by the 
CD8+ T cells was determined.
statistical analyses
Prism 7 (GraphPad Software) was used with the indicated 
tests. For comparison of cytotoxicity curves, areas under the 
curve for each sample in each experiment were used with 
one‑way ANO 
VA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons.
