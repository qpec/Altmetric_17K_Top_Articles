We read spam a lot: prospective cohort study of unsolicited 
and unwanted academic invitations
Andrew Grey,1 Mark J Bolland,1 Nicola Dalbeth,1 Greg Gamble,1 Lynn Sadler2 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To assess the amount, relevance, content, and 
suppressibility of academic electronic spam invitations 
to attend conferences or submit manuscripts.
Design
Prospective cohort study.
setting
Email accounts of participating academics.
PartiCiPants
Five intrepid academics and a great many publishers, 
editors, and conference organisers.
interventiOn
Unsubscribing from sender’s distribution lists.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Number of spam invitations received before, 
immediately after, and one year after unsubscribing 
from senders’ distribution lists. The proportion of 
duplicate invitations was also assessed and the 
relevance of each invitation graded to the recipient’s 
research interests. A qualitative assessment of the 
content of spam invitations was conducted.
results
At baseline, recipients received an average of 312 spam 
invitations each month. Unsubscribing reduced the 
frequency of the invitations by 39% after one month 
but by only 19% after one year. Overall, 16% of spam 
invitations were duplicates and 83% had little or no 
relevance to the recipients’ research interests. Spam 
invitations were characterised by inventive language, 
flattery, and exuberance, and they were sometimes 
baffling and amusing.
COnClusiOns
Academic spam is common, repetitive, often 
irrelevant, and difficult to avoid or prevent.
Introduction
Unsolicited and unwanted (spam) electronic invitations to 
speak at or attend conferences, or to write for or edit jour-
nals are a burgeoning aspect of academic life. Colleagues 
regard such invitations with wry amusement, intense 
 
frustration, or resignation. Two of us (AG, ND) have 
reviewed travel grant applications from colleagues who 
received spam invitations to give conference presentations.
Few studies have focused on academic spam. In the 
 
Academic Spam Study we investigated the amount, rele-
vance, content, and suppressibility of academic spam emails.
Methods
academic participants
In a deftly ironic twist, AG emailed five prospective collab-
orators to invite them to participate in the study. Invitations 
addressed the recipient as “Eminent Professor,” included 
five or more exclamation marks, and lacked an option to 
unsubscribe. Non-response to an invitation prompted a 
flurry of follow-up emails. Inclusion criteria were personal 
acquaintance with the first author, a sense of humour, a 
relentless wish to conduct leading edge research, despera-
tion for academic outputs, and an inability to say “no.” The 
exclusion criterion was application of a personal email 
spam filter. Four of the invited academics agreed to partici-
pate; one invitee lacked the inability to say “no.”
Collation and analysis of spam and non-spam emails
We defined academic spam as unsolicited and unwanted 
email invitations to attend or present at a conference or 
to write or edit for a journal. We included all emails the 
recipients considered to be spam. The investigators col-
lected spam emails received between 1 February 2014 
and 30 April 2014. During May 2014, the investigators 
unsubscribed from the mailing lists of organisations dis-
tributing spam. During June 2014 and April 2015, the 
investigators again collected spam emails.
We assessed the number of spam emails received in 
each collection phase. Detailed analysis was under-
taken of spam received in April 2014, June 2014, and 
April 2015. The investigators rated their spam invitations 
as being of no, low, medium, or high relevance to their 
academic careers. We determined the number of dupli-
cate spam invitations. When possible, we recorded the 
publisher for journal invitations and organising body for 
conference invitations. Finally, we conducted a qualita-
tive analysis, focusing on memorable spam.
Between 1 February 2014 and 30 April 2014, the investi-
gators collated invitations to speak at academic meetings 
or write for journals that they did not regard as spam.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved 
in developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study 
participants or the relevant patient community.

Results
The Academic Spam Study investigators are mid-career, 
modestly productive, and conduct research across sev-
eral disciplines (table 1). On the basis of salutations con-
tained in emails received during the study period, each 
investigator is highly esteemed. Modesty precludes a 
systematic description of the height of the esteem but 
according to these emails each investigator has “made 
important contributions,” is a “distinguished expert,” 
and has “great expertise,” sometimes in disciplines sur-
prisingly remote from the primary academic focus.
bulk spam
Unsurprisingly, therefore, we received many spam invita-
tions. Between 1 February 2014 and 30 April 2014, 936 spam 
invitations were received: an average of 312 for each calendar 
month (fig 1). Spam invitations outnumbered non-spam 
invitations (n=11) during this period by more than 80-fold. 
After unsubscribing from the mailing lists of organisations 
distributing spam during May 2014, the number of invita-
tions received in June 2014 decreased by 39%, to 190. In April 
2015, the number of spam invitations had increased to 253.
The proportions of spam invitations to write manu-
scripts and attend conferences were similar before and 
after unsubscribing (fig 2 ). Consistently, more than 75% 
of spam invitations were of no or low relevance to the 
recipient (fig 2).
reheated spam
In April 2014, June 2014, and April 2015, 74 of 356 (21%), 
30 of 190 (16%), and 27 of 253 (11%) of spam emails, 
respectively, were duplicates. The higher proportion in 
April 2014 was attributable to the receipt by one investi-
gator of 29 duplicate messages from the Korean Society 
for Bone and Mineral Research, 19 of which arrived 
within 72 seconds on one frenetic evening and the other 
10 within 57 seconds on a different evening.
spam distributors
During April 2014, four publishers each distributed 
more than 10 spam invitations to write a manuscript or 
edit a journal (table 2 ). These publishers have 
 
previously been labelled “predatory.”1 Three—Bentham 
Science, Herbert Publications, and Science Domain—
provided an option to unsubscribe. Spam emails from 
Bentham Science and Herbert Publications almost com-
pletely ceased after the month of unsubscribing. For 
Science Domain, the number of spam emails changed 
little in the month after unsubscribing, but by April 
2015 they had ceased. One publisher, OMICS Group, did 
not provide an option to unsubscribe and spam email 
remained substantial in subsequent months. Jacobs 
Publishers and Open Access Publications sent few 
spam messages in 2014 but each was a prominent 
source in April 2015. Eighteen sources of journal related 
spam were noted in April 2015 that had not featured in 
April 2014.
Three spam sources sent more than 10 conference 
invitations in April 2014. Two, BIT Life Sciences and 
OMICS Group, did not offer unsubscription and 
remained prominent sources of spam related to confer-
ences a year later.

spam dressed as lamb
We identified some eye catching subject lines. We 
learnt that good times happen at oral health confer-
ences (“Learn and Have Fun at the International Con-
ference on Orthognathic Surgery and Orthodontics”). 
We were tempted by “Cracking the Mysterious Psychi-
atric Disorders at Euro Psychiatry 2015,” and to 
“Unleash (y)our research ideas at Orthopedics and 
Rheumatology 2014.” We were interested in “Biologi-
cally signifying the  
clinical molecule,” and extremely 
interested in “Special Issue on Wine Health”—sadly, no 
offers to recruit mid-career academics to studies of 
wine were apparent. If we had a Startup, we would 
 
certainly want to know the answer to the question, 
“Think your Startup has the WOW factor?”
tasty spam
We found several memorable examples of tasty aca-
demic spam (box 1). We were impressed by the great 
enthusiasm of the invitations, featuring up to six excla-
mation marks! Flattery and inventive turns of phrase 
were prominent. Some invitations were unrestrainedly 
aspirational, and some conferences sported intriguing 
themes. We barely resisted the lure of an “Honorable 
certificate from MedCrave Editorial Office for publica-
tion of your eminent research in the inaugural issue.”
stir fried spam
Sometimes we found scrambled spam. We were unsure 
what to make of the session at the 3rd Annual World Con-
gress of Geriatrics and Gerontology 2015 that “can provide 
you with a best promotion channels in partner seeking, 
investor relation retreatment and talent search.” Or of the 
message from the International Journal of Applied Biology 
and Pharmaceutical Technology that invited contribution 
of a manuscript for publication in the International Jour-
nal of Plant Animal and Environmental Science. We were 
bemused that “the Jacobs Journal of Experimental Derma-
tology (JJED), invites experts in addiction research to sub-
mit original . . .” Rather too many invitations were 
disrespectful of our eminent selves—for example,

Premium spam
Some spam was almost too delicious to ignore. Box 2 
lists journals and conferences that we found especially 
intriguing.
discussion
The Academic Spam Study shows that mid-career aca-
demics in New Zealand receive on average 2.1 spam invi-
tations each day to publish papers and attend 
conferences. Unsubscribing had a modest and short 
lived effect on the quantity of received spam. Sixteen 
per cent of spam invitations were duplicates, and 83% 
were of little or no relevance to the recipient. Some 
organisations send spam invitations without an unsub-
scribe option, or persist despite recipients requesting 
unsubscription.
strengths and weaknesses of this study
Our study has limitations. Some invitations were removed 
by the institutional spam filter, so we might have underes-
timated the amount of spam. Our sample of researchers 
was too small to be representative of the academic commu-
nity. New Zealand is a small, remote country that might not 
be targeted by academic spam distributors, even though 
we have held the Rugby World Cup since 2011, and the Lord 
of the Rings movies were filmed here. We received a similar 
number of spam  
invitations to colleagues in Poland and 
Canada who assessed journal invitations, however.2

Comparison with other studies
Published research on academic spam is limited. Some 
senders of spam journal invitations are bad eggs,4  who 
misrepresent their locations and are usually open access 
publishers.2 
5  Spam invitations are often issued by preda-
tory organisations,2 
3 the modus operandi of which threat-
ens academic integrity.5 
6  Vigorous responses to spam 
invitations might generate humorous outcomes but not 
stop the invitations.7  Attempts to unsubscribe from spam 
invitations are only moderately successful, but stringent 
email filtering3  or threatening recidivist organisations 
with legal action8 might stop further communications.
implications and future research
We suggest further research on academic spam:
“Nobel and prestigious colleagues,
We are enthralled by prospect of novel research focus 
of academic spam so we make a proposition to improve 
enlightenment of evidence. We wish greatly to start 
journal and convene scientific meeting that focus on 
academic spam, so illustrious colleagues can form 
interdisciplinary web of scientific rigour to advance 
knowledge. Maybe we will christen soon Journal of 
Advances in Interdisciplinary Academic Spam and 
launch with alacrity the First Annual International 
Symposium on Academic Spam (Spam-2017). Once we 
identify publisher and conference organiser we will 
email academics to join this exciting novel venture! 
Honourable colleagues, stay tuned!!!!!!”

no financial relationships with any organisations that might have an 
interest in the submitted work in the previous three years. Relevant 
non-financial interests include: AG recently helped his son study 
persuasive language techniques for a high school term test. MJB uses 
exclamation marks in emails to indicate disbelief or for ironic 
emphasis, with the number of exclamation marks proportional to the 
lack of credibility of the statement. He dislikes exclamation marks used 
for other reasons. ND almost joined the editorial board of Hair: Therapy
