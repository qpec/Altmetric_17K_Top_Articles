Evaluating the Impact of Florida’s “Stand Your Ground”
Self-defense Law on Homicide and Suicide by Firearm
An Interrupted Time Series Study
David K. Humphreys, PhD; Antonio Gasparrini, PhD; Douglas J. Wiebe, PhD
IMPORTANCE In 2005, Florida amended its self-defense laws to provide legal immunity to
individuals using lethal force in self-defense. The enactment of “
stand your ground”laws in
the United States has been controversial and their effect on rates of homicide and homicide
by firearm is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the impact of Florida’
s stand your ground law on rates of homicide
and homicide by firearm.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using an interrupted time series design, we analyzed
monthly rates of homicide and homicide by firearm in Florida between 1999 and 2014. Data
were collected from the Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER)
web portal at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We used seasonally adjusted
segmented Poisson regression models to assess whether the onset of the law was associated
with changes in the underlying trends for homicide and homicide by firearm in Florida. We
also assessed the association using comparison states without stand your ground laws
(New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Virginia) and control outcomes (all suicides and suicides by
firearm in Florida). October 1, 2005, the effective date of the law, was used to define
homicides before and after the change.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Monthly rates of homicide, firearm-related homicide,
suicide, and suicide by firearm in Florida and the 4 comparison states.
RESULTS Prior to the stand your ground law, the mean monthly homicide rate in Florida was
0.49 deaths per 100 000 (mean monthly count, 81.93), and the rate of homicide by firearm
was 0.29 deaths per 100 000 (mean monthly count, 49.06). Both rates had an underlying
trend of 0.1% decrease per month. After accounting for underlying trends, these results
estimate that after the law took effect there was an abrupt and sustained increase in the
monthly homicide rate of 24.4% (relative risk [RR], 1.24; 95%CI, 1.16-1.33) and in the rate of
homicide by firearm of 31.6% (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.44). No evidence of change was found
in the analyses of comparison states for either homicide (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98-1.13) or
homicide by firearm (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.99-1.17). Furthermore, no changes were observed in
control outcomes such as suicide (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94-1.05) and suicide by firearm (RR,
0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.06) in Florida between 2005 and 2014.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The implementation of Florida’
s stand your ground
self-defense law was associated with a significant increase in homicides and homicides by
firearm but no change in rates of suicide or suicide by firearm.

T
hroughout the United States the application of lethal
force as a means of self-defense is governed by crimi-
nal law.1 Since the colonial era, it has been an individu-
al’
s “duty to retreat” from perceived threats before resorting
to any use of force. When force is unavoidable for self-
defense, one must demonstrate that steps were taken to re-
treat first. The “castle doctrine” is an exception, granting in-
dividuals who encounter threats in their own home (ie, their
castle) immunity when using lethal force.2 Since 2005, states
across the United States have made changes to their self-
defenselaws,removingthedutytoretreatandallowingtheuse
oflethalforceinsituations(insideandoutsidethehome)where
an individual perceives a threat of harm.3
“Stand your ground” laws have been implemented in 23
states to date, with considerable debate about their potential
impact on public health (Box).4-6 Advocates of the laws sug-
gest that the increased threat of retaliatory violence deters
would-be burglars, resulting in fewer intruder encounters.4
Critics are concerned that weakening the punitive conse-
quences of using force may serve to escalate aggressive
encounters.7 They also argue that these laws may exacerbate
racial disparities in homicide where threats motivated by ra-
cial stereotypes produce unnecessary fatalities.2,7
Few evaluations of the impact of stand your ground laws
on homicide have been conducted. Evaluations of Arizona’
s
and Texas’stand your ground laws found no statistically sig-
nificant impact on homicide.8,9 Several observational studies
have assessed whether homicide rates are higher in states
with stand your ground laws compared with states without.
Using uniform crime reports from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), 1 study that used a difference in differ-
ences design to examine changes in 20 states that enacted
stand your ground laws between 2000 and 2010 compared
with all nonparticipating states found an associated 8%
increase in homicide.10 A study using US vital statistics data
for the same time period, using comparable methods for the
same states, found that the enactment was associated, on
average, with a 7.1% increase in homicides.11 In 2016 a study
by Gius,12 using uniform crime reports (FBI data) between
1995 and 2010, found no relationship between the enactment
of stand your ground laws and either homicide or firearm
homicide.
On April 26, 2005, Governor Jeb Bush signed Florida State
Bill 436, enacting Florida’
s stand your ground law.3,13 The law
increased the scope of self-defense claims by creating a “no
duty to retreat” rule when individuals “reasonably believed”
that force was necessary to prevent harm to themselves or
others.2 The Florida law extended the no duty to retreat clause
of the castle doctrine to public places. In addition, the law cre-
ated a series of conditions to strengthen the rights of indivi-
duals claiming self defense, including extending no duty to
retreat to situations where the defendant initiated a confron-
tation, extending the use of lethal force as a legitimate de-
fense for the protection of private property (eg, to deter ve-
hicle theft), entitling defendants to pretrial immunity hearings
allowing judges to sanction immunity prior to jury trial, and
providing defendants with immunity from any ensuing civil
lawsuits.1,7
As the first state to implement a stand your ground law,
Florida is an important test case about the removal of the
duty to retreat principle. We used the years that have elapsed
since the enactment of the Florida law as a natural experi-
ment to assess its impact on rates of homicide and homicide
by firearm.

Key Points
Question Did the implementation of Florida’
s “
stand your ground”
self-defense law have an impact on homicide and homicide by
firearm between 2005 and 2014?
Findings This study used an interrupted time series design to
analyze changes in rates of homicide and firearm-related
homicide. We found that the implementation of Florida’
s stand
your ground law was associated with a 24.4% increase in homicide
and a 31.6% increase in firearm-related homicide.
Meaning The removal of restrictions on when and where
individuals can use lethal force was associated with a significant
increase in homicide and homicide by firearm in Florida.

Methods
Study Design
We used an interrupted time series design to compare monthly
rates of homicide in Florida before and after the stand your
ground law came into effect on October 1, 2005. Interrupted
time series designs use data that are collected over time, usu-
ally recorded at regular intervals (eg, months).14-17 These data
are used to identify an underlying trend and when an inter-
vention (eg, new law) occurs at a known time, postinterven-
tion trends can be examined for distinct changes from preex-
isting trends—thus serving as the counterfactual.18 This study
design can be valuable in situations where retrospective evalu-
ations of population level interventions are required.19,20
A potential limitation of interrupted time series designs is
thepossibilitythatotherfactorsthatoccursimultaneouslymay
distort estimates of intervention effects. Such factors might in-
clude national changes in social or economic variables (eg, a
recession) or events that have a profound and lasting impact
on society (eg, natural disasters). Additional design elements
can be added to interrupted time series designs to assess
whether such factors are influencing statistical estimates.14,15
Weemployed2suchdesignfeatures:analysisofhomiciderates
in 4 comparison states (New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Vir-
ginia), and analysis of control outcomes (suicide and suicide
by firearm).
These analyses help to rule out the possibility of misat-
tributing any changes to causal factors unrelated to the inter-
vention in question. From the 27 states that had not imple-
mented stand your ground laws as of September 2016 only 4
had consistent monthly homicide data that could be used for
analysis. The analyses of suicide and suicide by firearm tested
for comparable intervention effects in variables that may be
equally sensitive to social and economic trends, but that we
did not hypothesize to be affected by the stand your ground
law. If patterns in these analyses showed changes similar to
those found in our analyses of homicide and homicide by fire-
arm, it may be reasonable to assume that any estimated inter-
vention effect was not attributable to the stand your ground
law.14,15,20-22
Data Sources
We collected monthly totals of homicides and suicides (in
total and for firearm-related cases) for Florida between Janu-
ary 1999 and December 2014. The data were accessed through
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’
s (CDC) Wide-
ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER)
web portal.23 We classified cases by place of occurrence
(within or outside the State of Florida), cause of death (homi-
cide or suicide), mechanism (firearms or other means), and
month of occurrence. We classified causes of death using the
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision
(ICD-10).24
Outcome Measures
We extracted 4 monthly time series: (a) all homicide (ICD-10,
X85 to Y09); (b) all suicide (ICD-10, X60 to X84); (c) homi-
cide by firearm (ICD-10, X93-X95); and (d) suicide by firearm
(ICD-10, X72-X74). Additional analyses were disaggregated
by racial and ethnic grouping (white or African American), age
group (0-19 years, 20-34 years, and ≥35 years), and sex (male
or female) for all outcomes. Population denominators were
calculated separately for each series using annual population
estimates from the US Census Bureau.25 In total, each of these
time series spanned 192 months (82 preintervention and 110
postintervention).
Data Analysis
Weevaluatedwhetherpostinterventiontrendsinhomicideand
homicide by firearm in Florida differed significantly from pre-
intervention trends. We used segmented quasi-Poisson re-
gression analysis to analyze trends in both periods and esti-
mate an effect size taking underlying trends into account.
Recent technical tutorials provide a detailed explanation of
these models.18,26 Time series analyses may be confounded by
seasonal effects that generate stable highs and lows in data
trends. To account for this we applied seasonal models, using
harmonictermsthatcontrolforseasonalinfluences.18,19,27Ow-
ing to the time sequencing of data points used in time series
analysis, residual autocorrelation can lead to the violation of
regression assumptions. Where significant residual autocor-
relation was detected (P < .10) and the assumptions of the gen-
eral linear models became problematic, robust standard er-
rors were generated (using a sandwich estimator) to produce
more conservative estimates of uncertainty.28
Owing to the nature of the intervention—a legal change
fixed at 1 point in time—we hypothesized the potential im-
pact of Florida’
s stand your ground law as an immediate and
permanent change.18 Analysis was repeated for comparison
states without stand your ground laws to test the validity of
any effects observed for Florida. The comparison between
Florida and other states was tested statistically by including
an interaction term in a single model including intervention
andcomparisonstates.Inaddition,sensitivityanalysiswasper-
formed using rates of suicide and firearm suicide as a control
outcomeforbothFloridaandcomparisonstates.Thiswasdone
to assess specific biases that may have resulted from the on-
set of the 2008 economic crisis in the United States, which
could potentially effect homicide rates indirectly.29 We chose
suicide because recent research shows a significant associa-
tion between suicide and the onset of the 2008 financial cri-
ses and subsequent austerity policies.19,30,31
Stratified analysis was conducted to investigate whether
the stand your ground law may have had a distributional im-
pactonraceandethnicity,agegroup,andsexinFlorida.Where
large numbers of data points were missing or suppressed ow-
ing to small cell counts (eg, <10 cases per month), we could not
analyze certain population groups separately. This included:
Hispanic populations (all analyses); children and adolescents
(≤19 years); African American populations (suicide and sui-
cide by firearm); and females (homicide). Thus, analyses for
these groups are not reported. All data analysis was con-
ducted in R statistical software (version 3.1.2; RStudio, Inc)
using RStudio (version 0.99.486; RStudio Inc). Statistical sig-
nificance was taken as P < .05.

Results
Between 1999 and October 2005, Florida had a mean monthly
homicide count of 81.93, a homicide rate of 0.49 deaths per
100 000 population and a mean monthly homicide by fire-
arm count of 49.06, a homicide by firearm rate of 0.29 deaths
per 100 000 population, with 59.1% of all homicides result-
ing from firearm injuries. There was a slight decline in monthly
rates of homicide and homicide by firearm over this period.
In the 9 years following the implementation of the stand your
ground law, both rates increased with a mean monthly count
of 99.22 and 69.29, respectively (homicide, 0.53 deaths per
100 000 population; homicide by firearm, 0.37 deaths per
100 000 population; 69.8% of homicides by firearm) (Table 1).
After accounting for underlying trends, we estimated a 24.4%
(RR, 1.24; 95% CI; 1.16-1.33; P < .001) increase in the postinter-
vention monthly homicide rate when compared with prein-
tervention trends. For homicide by firearm the findings were
similar, with an estimated 31.6% (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.44;
P < .001) increase in postintervention monthly homicides by
firearmwhencomparedwithpreinterventiontrends.Figure1A
displays the magnitude of these effects for homicide and
Figure 1B shows homicide by firearm in relation to trends in
the comparison states.
Wecomparedthesefindingswithcomparisonstatestotest
whether such increases in patterns of homicide and homi-
cide by firearm were present in states unexposed to changes
in self-defense laws. We found no significant changes in post-
intervention homicide rates in the comparison states when

Stratified analyses for Florida found that the increases in
homicide affected all demographic groups, but that the mag-
nitude of effects was distributed unevenly across the popula-
tion (Table 2). Comparing preintervention and postinterven-
tion trends, the onset of the stand your ground law was
associated with significant increases in homicide for whites
(28.7%) (Figure 2B); African Americans (20.4%); those aged 20
to 34 years (31.7%) (Figure 2A); those 35 years or older (13.8%);
males (28.1%); and females (13.5%). Similar patterns were ob-
served when comparing preintervention and postinterven-
tion trends for homicide by firearm in Florida (Table 2). These
findings suggested a statistically significant increase in homi-
cide by firearm for whites (45.1%) (Figure 2B); African Ameri-
cans (22.9%); those 20 to 34 years (35.8%) (Figure 2A); those
35 years and older (21.5%); and males (31.8%). For suicide and
suicide by firearm, we found no significant differences be-
fore and after the law took effect.
Discussion
Since Florida’
s stand your ground law took effect in October
2005, rates of homicide and homicide by firearm in the state
havesignificantlyincreased;through2014,monthlyratesofho-
micide increased by 24.4% and monthly rates of homicide by
firearm by 31.6%. These increases appear to have occurred de-
spiteageneraldeclineinhomicideintheUnitedStatessincethe
early1990s.32Incontrast,ratesofhomicideandhomicidebyfire-
arm did not increase in states without a stand your ground law
(NewYork,NewJersey,Ohio,andVirginia),orforeithersuicide
or suicide by firearm. Our findings support the hypothesis that
increases in the homicide and homicide by firearm rates in
Florida are related to the stand your ground law. We found in-
creasesinhomicideandhomicidebyfirearminFloridainallthe
demographic groupings we examined; the largest proportional
increases were in those aged 20 to 34 years and among whites.
The increases in homicide and firearm homicide we re-
port are greater than those reported elsewhere—where in-
creases in homicide were estimated to be less than 10%.10,11
These differences may reflect differences in the stand your
groundlawsbetweenstates(theotherstudieswerenotofFlori-
da’
slaw),anddifferencesinsociodemographicandculturalfac-
tors, as well as firearm and other laws.
Limitations
Ourstudyhaslimitations.CircumstancesuniquetoFloridamay
have contributed to our findings, including those that we could
not identify. We did not compare the impact of stand your
ground laws across states; such analyses are susceptible to bi-
ases owing to differences in regulatory contexts and events or
other factors that influence homicide and firearm homicide
rates but that are unique to a particular state. Finally, there has
been considerable debate over the potential of the Florida law
to deter crime and improve public safety.30,31 Our study exam-
ined the effect of the Florida law on homicide and homicide
byfirearm,notoncrimeandpublicsafety.Wealsodidnotstudy
the effects on firearm injuries other than homicide or suicide.
Conclusions
The enactment of Florida’
s stand your ground law in 2005 has
been associated with abrupt and sustained increases in homi-
cide and homicide by firearm in the state.
