IntroductIon
Osteocalcin (OCN) is a multipurpose bone-derived hor-
mone (Karsenty and Olson, 2016). In particular, OCN crosses 
the blood–brain barrier, binds to neurons in specific brain 
regions, prevents neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus, fa-
vors the synthesis of all monoamine neurotransmitters, and 
inhibits that of gamma-aminobutyric acid. These cellular 
and molecular functions may explain why OCN is neces-
sary for hippocampal-dependent memory and to reduce 
anxiety-like behaviors (Oury et al., 2013). The severity of 
the cognitive deficit noted in any mouse model lacking a 
hormone synthesized in a peripheral organ, such as OCN, 
brings up several questions.
One question raised by the cognitive defects seen in 
Ocn−/− mice, and by the fact that circulating levels of OCN 
plummet early in the life of all species (Chiappe et al., 1999; 
Mera et al., 2016), is to determine whether pathological con-
ditions developing over time in adult animals that also affect 
physiological processes regulated by OCN could be sec-
ondary, in part, to this plummet in circulating OCN levels. 
Hippocampal-dependent memory is one such physiological 
process. The ability of plasma from young mice to improve 
cognitive function when injected into older mice (Villeda et 
al., 2014) and the availability of Ocn−/− mice provide neces-
sary tools to begin addressing this question. A complementary 
approach to answering this question is to assess whether pe-
ripheral delivery of exogenous OCN is sufficient to improve 
the deficit in cognitive functions seen in older WT mice. A 
second question, of mechanistic and translational nature, is to 
elucidate OCN’s mode of action in the brain. This requires 
identifying a receptor that transduces OCN signal in the 
brain regions where it binds.
Addressing the first question, we show here that injec-
tions of plasma from young mice into older mice can improve 
their cognitive function only if the plasma contains OCN 
and that exogenous OCN is sufficient to correct the decline 
in cognitive function observed in older mice. Addressing the 
that osteocalcin (ocn) is necessary for hippocampal-dependent memory and to prevent anxiety-like behaviors raises novel 
questions. one question is to determine whether ocn is also sufficient to improve these behaviors in wild-type mice, when 
circulating levels of ocn decline as they do with age. Here we show that the presence of ocn is necessary for the beneficial 
influence of plasma from young mice when injected into older mice on memory and that peripheral delivery of ocn is suffi-
cient to improve memory and decrease anxiety-like behaviors in 16-mo-old mice. A second question is to identify a receptor 
transducing ocn signal in neurons. Genetic, electrophysiological, molecular, and behavioral assays identify Gpr158, an orphan 
G protein–coupled receptor expressed in neurons of the cA3 region of the hippocampus, as transducing ocn’s regulation of 
hippocampal-dependent memory in part through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. these 
results indicate that exogenous ocn can improve hippocampal-dependent memory in mice and identify molecular tools to 
harness this pathway for therapeutic purposes.

iological, molecular, and functional evidence that the orphan 
class C G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr158 medi-
ates OCN’s regulation of cognitive function. T

could be harnessed to combat cognitive decline.
results And dIscussIon
To determine whether OCN is a necessary component of 
plasma from young mice, contributing to its beneficial ef-
fect on cognition in older mice, we relied on the novel 
object recognition (NOR) test, which evaluates hippo-
campal-dependent memory because this task is altered in 
Ocn−/− mice (Oury et al., 2013). 16-mo-old WT mice 
had a significant defect in hippocampal-dependent memory 
compared with 3-mo-old (young) WT mice. This cognitive 
defect was significantly improved when plasma from young 
mice was injected into 16-mo-old mice but not when plasma 
from other 16-mo-old WT mice was injected in 16-mo-old 
WT littermates (Fig. 1 A). Because OCN limits anxiety-like 
behavior (Oury et al., 2013), we also subjected young and 
16-mo-old mice to the elevated plus maze test (EPMT), 
which assesses anxiety-like behavior as a shorter time spent 
in the open arms and fewer number of entries in the open 
arms (Crawley, 1985). 
We found that plasma from young mice, 
when injected into 16-mo-old mice, significantly reduced 
anxiety-like behaviors (Fig. 1 B).
In contrast, when plasma from young Ocn−/− mice 
was injected into 16-mo-old WT mice, there was no im-
provement of hippocampal-dependent memory or anxi-
ety-like behaviors in the recipient mice (Fig. 1, A and B; and 
Fig. S1 A). The inability of the plasma from young Ocn−/− 
mice to improve cognition in older mice was not explained 
by an increase in β2 microglobulin accumulation, a progeronic 
molecule in this plasma (Smith et al., 2015; Fig. S1 B). T
o 
further demonstrate that the presence of OCN is necessary 
for the beneficial effect of plasma from young mice on cogni-
tion when injected into 16-mo-old WT mice, we performed 
two experiments. First, we used plasma obtained from young 
Ocn−/− mice that had been supplemented with mouse re-
combinant uncarboxylated OCN (spiked plasma). We first 
verified that injections of spiked plasma increased circulating 
OCN levels in 16-mo-old 
WT mice (Fig. S1 C). Remarkably, 
injections of spiked plasma in 16-mo-old WT mice resulted 
in the same improvement in hippocampal-dependent mem-
ory that is achieved by injections of plasma from 3-mo-old 
WT mice (Fig. 1, A and B). 
This beneficial effect of the spiked 
plasma on cognitive function was not explained by a change 
in the accumulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 
2 (TIMP2) in the hippocampus, a molecule implicated in 
the beneficial effect of young plasma on cognition (Castel-
lano et al., 2017; Fig. 1 C). Consistent with the beneficial 
effect of young plasma injections into older mice, injections 
of spiked plasma significantly reduced anxiety-like behaviors 
in 16-mo-old WT mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Second, we used 
an anti-OCN antibody to deplete OCN from the plasma 
of young WT mice. We verified before injection of this im-
mune-depleted plasma that OCN content was decreased by 
90% (Fig. S1 D). In a mirror image of what was observed 
when using spiked plasma, immune-depleted plasma from 
WT mice failed to increase hippocampal memory and to re-
duce anxiety to the same extent as control plasma (Fig. 1, D 
and E). T
ogether, these experiments indicate that OCN is a 
necessary contributor to the beneficial effect of plasma from 
young WT mice on hippocampal-dependent memory and 
anxiety-like behaviors in older WT mice.
The steep decrease in circulating OCN levels before 1 
yr of age (Fig. S1 E), and the crucial contribution of OCN 
to the beneficial effect of plasma from young mice on cog-
nitive function of older mice, prompted us to test whether 
exogenous OCN would be sufficient to improve cognition 
in older mice. This was addressed by delivering OCN pe-
ripherally and continuously through minipumps for 2 mo 
in 14-mo-old WT mice because this hormone crosses the 
blood–brain barrier (Oury et al., 2013). This mode of ad-
ministration substantially increased circulating OCN levels 
(Fig. S1 F). When tested for NOR, 16-mo-old WT mice 
that had received OCN continuously for 2 mo displayed a 
hippocampal-dependent memory that was similar to that of 
3-mo-old WT mice (Fig. 1 F). The same improvement was 
observed when memory was analyzed through the Morris 
water maze test, which assesses spatial learning and memory 
in rodents (Nakazawa et al., 2002; Fig. 1 G). Similar results 
were observed in 12-mo-old WT mice (Fig. S1, G and H). In 
agreement with the notion that OCN regulates anxiety-like 
behaviors, chronic delivery of OCN improved anxiety-like 
behaviors as assayed by the EPMT in 12- and 16-mo-old 
WT 
mice (Oury et al., 2013; Fig. 1 H and Fig. S1 I).
The fact that OCN is necessary for the maintenance, 
and sufficient for the restoration, of cognitive function in 
older mice underscored the importance of identifying a re-
ceptor for this hormone in the brain because Gprc6a, OCN’s 
receptor in peripheral organs (Karsenty and Olson, 2016), 
does not mediate OCN’s functions in the brain (Oury et al., 
2013). The bell-shaped curve of OCN signaling in brain-
stem explants (Oury et al., 2013) suggested that, as in the 
case of Gprc6a, the receptor for OCN in the brain might be 
a GPCR. 
We used three criteria to identify an orphan GPCR 
capable of transducing OCN signal in the brain.
The first criterion was that this orphan GPCR should 
belong to the same subfamily of GPCRs as Gprc6a, the class 
C subfamily. Second, this Gpcr should be expressed in the 
CA3 region of the hippocampus where OCN binds (Oury 
et al., 2013), and third, this Gpcr should not be expressed in 
cell types where OCN’s signal is transduced through Gprc6a 
(Fig. 2 A). Using this approach, we identified one orphan 
class C GPCR, Gpr158, as being robustly expressed in neu-
rons of the CA3 region of the hippocampus but not in any 
 
Gprc6a-expressing cells in peripheral tissues (Fig. 2, B and D; 
and Fig. S2, A and C). Gpr158 is present in Map2-expressing

pyramidal neurons from the CA3 region of the hippocam-
pus but not in Gfap-expressing astrocytes in vivo (Fig. 2 F 
and Fig. S2 D). Similar results were obtained in cultured 
hippocampal cells using a specific antibody against Gpr158 
(Fig. 2 G and Fig. S2 E). Adding credence to the notion 
that Gpr158 may be an OCN receptor, its accumulation 
was higher in Ocn−/− than in WT hippocampi, circulating 
OCN levels were twofold higher in Gpr158−/− compared 
with WT littermates, and local delivery of OCN in the ante-
rior hippocampus induced c-Fos accumulation in neurons of 
the CA3 region in WT but not in Gpr158−/− mice (Fig. 2, 
H–J; and Fig. S2 F). A systematic analysis of its expression by 
in situ hybridization showed that Gpr158 is also expressed 
in the somatosensory, motor, and auditory areas of the cor-
tex, the piriform cortex, the retro-splenial area, and the ven-
tral tegmental area (Fig. 2 E). A signaling pathway recruited 
by GPR158 was identified by a pull-down assay performed 
on solubilized membranes obtained from Ocn−/− hippo-
campi. In the conditions of this assay, biotin-labeled OCN 
bound a complex containing Gpr158 and Gαq (Fig. 2 K). 
The amount of Gαq pulled down was greatly reduced when 
membranes from Gpr158−/− hippocampi were used to per-
form this assay (Fig. 2 K). Consistent with the presence of 
Gαq in this complex, OCN increased the production of ino-
sitol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) significantly more in WT than 
Gpr158−/− hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2 L) and failed to 
increase in cAMP production (Fig. S2 H).
We used behavioral and electrophysiological assays to as-
sess whether Gpr158 mediates OCN’s regulation of cognitive 
function. Using NOR, we observed that mice lacking Gpr158 
in the forebrain only had a deficit in hippocampal-dependent 
memory, as Gpr158−/− mice did. This deficit, however, was 
less severe in Gpr158CamkIIa−/− than in Gpr158−/− mice 
(Fig. 3 A and Fig. S3, A–D), most likely because of the low 
efficiency of Gpr158 deletion using CamkIIa-Cre mice (Fig. 
S3 D). Hence, we used Gpr158−/− mice for the rest of 
the experiments. Because the deficit observed in the Mor-
ris water maze test was less severe in Gpr158−/− mice than 
what was reported in Ocn−/− mice (Fig. 3 B), we performed 
three additional experiments to establish that Gpr158 medi-
ates OCN’s ability to favor hippocampal-dependent mem-
ory. First, we delivered OCN peripherally and continuously 
through minipumps for 1 mo in Gpr158−/− mice before 
testing. This delivery of OCN failed to rescue the cognitive 
defect observed in Gpr158−/− mice (Fig. 3 C and Fig. S3 E). 
Second, we injected lentivirus expressing either shRNA tar-
geting Gpr158, which resulted in a >60% decrease in Gpr158 
protein levels, or scrambled shRNA as a control, in the dorsal 
hippocampus of 3-mo-old WT male mice (Fig. S3 F). T
en 
days later, OCN was injected at the same stereotaxic coor-
dinates. We found that local delivery of OCN significantly 
improved hippocampal-dependent memory in control mice 
but not in mice in which Gpr158 accumulation had been 
efficiently down-regulated (Fig. 3 D). A similar result was 
observed when mice were subjected to contextual fear con-
ditioning, which measures associative memory and requires 
the integrity of the hippocampus (Saxe et al., 2006; Denny 
et al., 2012; Fig. 3 E). Third, we analyzed compound hetero-
zygous mice (Gpr158+/−;Ocn+/−). Whereas single hetero-
zygous mice did not display any measurable abnormalities in 
the NOR, Gpr158+/−;Ocn+/− mice behaved similarly to 
Gpr158−/− or Ocn−/− mice (Fig. 3 F).
T
o add support to the notion that Gpr158 mediates 
OCN’s regulation of cognitive functions, we performed 
electrophysiological studies in WT and Gpr158−/− cells. In 
whole-cell current-clamp recordings, we found that OCN 
enhanced action potential (AP) frequency in pyramidal cells 
of the CA3 region of WT but not Gpr158−/− hippocampi 
(Fig. 3 G and Fig. S3 G). Consistent with the observation that 
Gpr158 forms a complex with Gαq, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl 
borate, an IP3 receptor antagonist (Maruyama et al., 1997), 
nearly abolished OCN’s ability to enhance AP frequency 
in pyramidal cells of the CA3 region (Fig. 3 H). Next, we 
examined long-term potentiation (LTP) expression in syn-
apses from the mossy fiber (MF) to CA3 neurons using hip-
pocampal slices from WT and Gpr158−/− mice. The field 
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) recorded in the 
CA3 region by stimulating the MF cells could be blocked by 
the application of DCG-IV (Fig. S3 H). T
o verify LTP at the 
MF-CA3 pyramidal synapses (Kamiya et al., 1996), two trains 
of tetanic stimulation were applied to the MF-CA3 synapses 
after a stable baseline of fEPSPs were recorded. The tetanic 
stimulation induced a brief post-tetanic potentiation and LTP 
in WT (baseline, 106.5 ± 3.4%; 50 min after tetanus, 126.7 ± 
10.1%; P < 0.05) but not in Gpr158−/− hippocampal slices 
(baseline, 100.9 ± 1.5%; 50 min after tetanus, 104.9 ± 6.8%; P 
> 0.05; Fig. 3 I). Of note, tetanic stimulation induced a brief 
depression but no potentiation right after the completion of 
the tetanus in Gpr158−/− slices.
Because OCN regulates anxiety-like behaviors, we sub-
jected Gpr158−/− and WT littermates to the EPMT and 
the dark-to-light transition test, which measures anxiety-like 
behaviors on the basis of the innate aversion of rodents to 
brightly illuminated areas (Crawley, 1985). As in the case 
of Ocn+/− and Ocn−/− mice, anxiety-like behavior was 
increased in 3-mo-old Gpr158+/− and Gpr158−/− mice 
(Student’s t test). (F–H) NOR (F), Morris water maze test (MWMT; G), and EPMT (H) performed in 3-mo-old (n = 10–15) and older WT mice treated with saline 
(n = 12–14) or OCN (n = 13–14; 90 ng/h) for 2 mo. For NOR, discrimination index was measured (one-way ANO 
VA followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test 
compared with WT young). For MWMT, the graph shows the time to localize a submerged platform in the swimming area (two-way repeated-measures 
ANO 
VA followed by a Fisher’s least significantly different post hoc test compared with 3 mo old). For EPMT, time spent in the open arms was measured 
(one-way ANO 
VA followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test compared with WT young). Results are given as mean ± SEM. *, P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001.

(Fig. 3, J and K). In a third test, the open field test (OFT), 
which measures anxiety as a decrease in total ambulation 
and time spent in the center of the box, Gpr158+/− and 
Gpr158−/− mice displayed anxiety-like behaviors similar to 
Ocn+/− and Ocn−/− mice (Oury et al., 2013; Fig. 3, L 
and M). Additionally, the month-long peripheral delivery of 
OCN to Gpr158−/− did not reduce anxiety-like behavior in 
these mice (Fig. S3 I).
In trying to identify molecular events triggered by OCN 
through Gpr158, we asked whether OCN may act through 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, a mo-
lecular pathway critical for hippocampal-dependent memory, 
whose regulation by bone-derived signals has not yet been 
reported (Hall et al., 2000; Yamada and Nabeshima, 2003). 
For that purpose, we monitored the transport of BDNF- 
containing dense-core vesicles in embryonic rat neurons 
seeded in microchambers, and transduced with lentivirus, al-
lowing the expression of BDNF-mCherry (Fig. 4 A). These 
neurons were left to differentiate for 9 to 11 d. Axons were 
imaged every 200 ms in microchannels to quantify kinetics of 
anterograde (from soma to synapse) and retrograde (from syn-
apse to axon) transport of BDNF vesicles under control con-
ditions or after 4 h of OCN treatment. OCN thus stimulates 
the global trafficking of BDNF vesicles and its specific trans-
port to synapses, as shown by the increase in transport veloc-
ity of both anterograde and retrograde BDNF vesicles and 
the decrease in time spent in pause (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, the 
number of motile anterograde vesicles was larger (Fig. 4 B).
Several lines of evidence obtained using WT or 
Gpr158-null cells support the notion that BDNF is a media-
tor of OCN’s functions in the brain. First, Bdnf expression was 
decreased in hippocampi and midbrains of Gpr158−/− mice 
(Fig. 4 C and Fig. S3 J) and OCN increased Bdnf expression 
significantly more in WT than in Gpr158−/− cultured hip-
pocampal neurons (Fig. 4 D). Second, delivery of OCN in-
creased the accumulation of BDNF in mice that had received 
scrambled shRNA but not in those in which Gpr158 abun-
dance had been efficiently decreased by shRNA targeting 
Gpr158 (Fig. 4, E and F). Third, peripheral delivery of OCN 
increased Bdnf expression in hippocampi of 16-mo-old WT 
mice (Fig. 4 G). Fourth, BDNF accumulation was increased 
in hippocampi of older WT mice receiving plasma from 
young WT mice but not in hippocampi of older mice re-
ceiving plasma from young Ocn−/− or from older WT mice 
(Fig. 4 H). Last, BDNF accumulation in the hippocampus was 
higher in 16-mo-old 
WT mice that had received plasma from 
Ocn−/− mice supplemented with OCN (Fig. 4 H).
The identification of extracellular cues favoring hip-
pocampal-dependent memory, and the elucidation of their 
mechanism of action, is of utmost importance to understand 
how cognition is regulated and can be altered under patho-
logical circumstances. At the same time, the identification of 
such molecules raises questions regarding their signaling in 
the brain. By showing that the bone-derived hormone OCN 
is sufficient to improve hippocampal-dependent memory in 
16-mo-old mice, the results presented here underscore the 
importance of OCN in modulating these functions through-
out life. That these effects of OCN signaling in the brain are 
independent of β2 microglobulin and TIMP2 indicates that 
multiple circulating molecules, some of which are hormones, 
affect cognitive function (Villeda et al., 2014; Castellano et 
al., 2017). As a critically important molecular extension of 
this work, we show through several types of assays that OCN 
mediates its influence on cognitive function through its inter-
action with an orphan class C GPCR, Gpr158. The identifi-
cation of a receptor, expressed in neurons of the hippocampal 
CA3 region that transduces OCN signal, paves the way to po-
tentially use this pathway for therapeutic purposes. As import-
ant, because Gpr158 is expressed in other regions of the brain 
besides the hippocampus, its identification as a receptor for 
OCN provides a much-needed tool to embark on a more ex-
tensive analysis of the functions OCN may have in the brain.

Animals
For all experiments, we used females and littermates as con-
trols unless otherwise stated. Ocn−/− (oscm1/oscm1) mice 
were generated by our laboratory and previously described 
(Ducy et al., 1996). Gpr158−/− (Gpr158tm1(KOMP)Vlcg) mice 
were purchased from the KOMP repository (VG10108). This 
mouse line was made by the insertion of a LacZ cassette with 
a stop codon in the first two exons of Gpr158 (Orlandi et al., 
2015). Gpr158 conditional allele generation strategy is de-
scribed in Fig. S3 A. Gpr158f/f were generated using 129/Sv 
 
embryonic stem cells. Chimeric mice harboring a mutant 
allele of Gpr158 were crossed with C57BL/6J WT, and 
Gpr158f/+ mice were then crossed with CamkIIa-Cre (T29-
1; Jax: B6.Cg-Tg[Camk2a-cre]T29-1Stl/J) to obtain F2 gen-
eration. Analyses of Gpr158CamkIIa-Cre were performed with

SvEvTac mice were purchased from Taconic Biosciences. 
Eighteen-mo-old C57BL/6J were obtained from the Na-
tional Institute on Aging. Upon arrival at the animal facility, 
mice were housed at least 2 wk before experiments were per-
formed. Gpr158+/−, Ocn+/−, and Gpr158+/−;Ocn+/− 
and Gpr158−/− were maintained on a 129-Sv/C57BL/6J 
mixed genetic background. Ocn−/− mice were maintained 
on a 129-Sv background. Mice were housed five animals per 
cage (polycarbonate cages, 35.5 × 18 × 12.5 cm), under a 12-h 
light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water be-
fore experimentation. All experiments involving animals were 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee of Columbia University Medical Center and by the 
European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/UE).
Primary hippocampal culture
Hippocampal neurons were isolated from mouse embryos 
(embryonic day 16.5). After dissection, hippocampi were di-
gested with trypsin 0.05% and EDTA 0.02% for 15 min at 
37°C. After three washes with DMEM (containing high glu-
cose and sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 
U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 1× GlutaMAX, cells were 
dissociated by pipetting up and down, and then plated. After 
the culture was established, culture medium (Neurobasal me-
dium [21103-049; Thermo Fisher Scientific] supplemented 
with B-27 supplement [17504044; Thermo Fisher Scientific] 
and 1× GlutaMAX [35050061; Thermo Fisher Scientific]) 
was changed two times per week. Experiments were per-
formed on cells after 15 d of culture.
Plasma collection
Pooled mouse plasma was collected from 3-mo-old WT or 
Ocn−/− mice or 16-mo-old 
WT mice by intracardial bleed 
at time of euthanasia. Plasma was prepared from blood col-
lected with EDTA into Capiject (T-MQK; Terumo) tubes 
followed by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min. All plasma 
aliquots were stored at −80°C until use. Before adminis-
tration, plasma was dialyzed using 3.5-kD D-tube dialyz-
ers (71508-3; EMD Millipore) in PBS to remove EDTA. 
Mice were systemically treated with plasma (100 µl per 
injection) by injections into the tail vein eight times over 
24 d before behavioral analysis. For Western blot analy-
sis, mice were sacrificed to collect hippocampi 4 h after a 
single plasma injection.
Immunodepletion of ocn from plasma
T
o remove OCN from plasma derived from 6–12-wk-old 
mice, anti-C-terminal OCN antibody (Ferron et al., 2010b) 
or goat control IgG (R&D Systems) was conjugated to 2.8-µm 
 
superparamagnetic M-270 Epoxy Dynabeads according to 
 
the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 
 
with a coupling ratio of 7 µg of antibody per 1 mg of beads. 
Covalent conjugation was done at 37°C for 24 h with end-
over-end rotation. Coupled beads were washed with PBS 
before incubation with plasma to prevent detergent contam-
ination. Plasma pooled from 6–12-wk-old female C57BL/6J 
mice was incubated with beads coupled either to anti-C- 
terminal OCN antibody or goat control IgG at 4°C over-
night with end-over-end rotation, after which the plasma 
was dialyzed, aliquoted, and kept frozen at −80°C until use. 
An aliquot of plasma treated with either anti-C-terminal 
OCN antibody or goat control IgG was analyzed using an 
OCN ELI 
SA to confirm significant reduction of OCN in 
the immunodepleted plasma.
osmotic pumps
Alzet micro-osmotic pumps (model 1002) were loaded with 
saline or uncarboxylated OCN (30 ng/hr for 12-mo-old and 
90 ng/hr for 16-mo-old mice). Mice were anesthetized with 
isoflurane, and osmotic pumps were surgically installed sub-
cutaneously in the backs of the mice for 28 d.
Gene expression analysis by quantitative Pcr
All dissections were performed in ice-cold PBS 1× under a 
Leica MZ8 dissecting light microscope. All parts of the brain 
isolated were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80°C 
until use. T
otal RNA was isolated from brain tissue and hip-
pocampal cells using TRI 
ZOL (Invitrogen). T

Two trains of tetanic stimulation (arrow) were applied to the MF-CA3 synapse (100 Hz, 1-s duration, and 10-s interval) once a stable baseline of fEPSC was 
recorded. Representative traces of fEPSPs recorded from WT (i) and Gpr158−/− slices (ii). Traces recorded before (1) and 50 min after (2) two trains of tetanic

13–15) littermates. For EPMT, time spent in the open arms was scored; for DLT, time spent in the lit compartment was measured; for OFT, total ambulation 
and time spent in the center of the arena were measured (one-way ANO 
VA compared with WT followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test). Results are given as

In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed on cryosections from tis-
sue fixed with 4% PFA and using 35S-labeled riboprobe as 
previously described (Ducy et al., 1997). The sequence of Th, 
Gpr158, Gprc6a, Gpr156, Gpr179, Gprc5a, Gprc5b, Gprc5c, 
and Gprc5d probe are 500-bp to 1-kb fragments of each 
gene’s 3′ UTR. Hybridizations were performed overnight at 
58°C, and washes were performed at 63°C.
Hormonal and second messenger measurement
Circulating levels of OCN in mouse serum were determined 
with a specific ELI 
SA previously described (Ferron et al., 
2010a,b). Total levels of OCN and carboxylated OCN were 
estimated using two different specific antibodies. Bioactive 
OCN was determined by subtracting the carboxylated OCN 
levels from total OCN levels (Ferron et al., 2010a,b). cAMP 
accumulation was measured by using the cAMP Parameter 
Assay kit (50-900-648; R&D Systems) and performed in 
primary hippocampal neurons following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. IP1 accumulation was determined in primary 
hippocampal neurons by using the IP-One ELI 
SA assay kit 
(KGE002B; Cisbio) following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Results are calculated by dividing the optical density 
of the treated cells by that of the untreated cells and ex-
pressed as a percentage of stimulation according the manufac-
turer’s recommendations.
recombinant ocn
Mouse uncarboxylated OCN was purified from BL21 trans-
formed with pGEX2TK-mOCN as previously described 
(Lee et al., 2007; Ferron et al., 2010a; Oury et al., 2011, 2013; 
Mera et al., 2016). In brief, GST
-OCN fusion protein was 
bacterially produced in BL21 pLyS transformed with pGEX-
2TK-mOCN after induction with IPTG. Cells were col-
lected in lysis buffer (PBS 1×, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 2 mM 
EDTA, 1% Triton, and 1× protease and phosphatase inhibitor 
cocktail; 78443; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following four 
freeze-thaw cycles and sonication, lysates were cleared by 
centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with glutathi-
one-Sepharose 4B (17075601; GE) for 4 h at 4°C. Following 
six washes with washing buffer (PBS 1× and 1% Triton) and 
with PBS 1×, OCN was then cleaved out from the GST 
moiety by using thrombin (27-0846-01; GE). Four fractions 
were collected, and each of them was incubated with ben-
zamidine Sepharose (17-5123-10; GE) for 30 min at room 
temperature to remove thrombin.
Immunoblotting
Frozen hippocampi were pulverized in lysis buffer (20 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 7.65, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 
EGTA, and 1% Triton) supplemented with 1× protease and 
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (78443; Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and protein 
concentration was determined using a Bradford assay. Clar-
ified samples were heated at 65°C in Laemmli buffer for 5 
min. Proteins were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred 
to nitrocellulose membrane (1620112; Bio-Rad). Membranes 
were blocked with 
TBST
-5% BSA for 1 h, incubated with pri-
mary antibody overnight at 4°C, and probed with HRP-con-
jugated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. 
The following 
antibodies were used in these studies: anti-TIMP2 (1:1,000; 
D18B7; Cell Signaling), anti–α-tubulin (1:5,000; T6199; 
Sigma-Aldrich), anti-b2 microglobulin (1:1,000; ab75853;

Immunohistochemistry
Primary cultured neurons were fixed with 4% PFA and 4% 
sucrose for 20 min and blocked in PBS containing 3% BSA 
and 0.2% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. Primary 
antibodies, anti-MAP2 (MAB364; EMD Millipore), anti–
glial fibrillary acidic protein (SAB2500462; Sigma-Aldrich), 
and anti-Gpr158 (ABIN486340; Antibodies-online) were 
diluted (1:400) in blocking solution and incubated overnight 
at 4°C. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS 1× 
containing Triton 0.2%, and secondary antibodies (1:200; 
Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in blocking solution 
were incubated for 1 h 30 min at room temperature. After 
three washes, coverslips were mounted with ProLong anti-
fade mountant (Life Technologies). Images were obtained 
with an inverted Zeiss ApoTome2 microscope. Immunoflu-
orescence of adult brains was performed on 35-µm coronal 
vibratome slices of tissue fixed with 4% PFA in 0.1 M phos-
phate buffer. Sections were permeabilized and blocked with 
0.5% Triton in TBS, pH 7.4, and 10% normal donkey serum. 
After blocking, sections were incubated with primary anti-
bodies overnight at 4°C. The following antibodies were used 
for this assay: anti-c-Fos (1:400; 2250; Cell Signaling), anti-β 
galactosidase (1:400; ab4761; Abcam), anti-MAP2 (1:1,000; 
ab5392; Abcam), and anti–glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(1:400; SAB2500462; Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were washed 
three times in 0.3% Triton in TBS, pH 7.4, followed by an 
incubation with secondary antibodies (1:200; Invitrogen) di-
luted in blocking solution and incubated for 1 h at room 
temperature. After three washes, sections were mounted with 
Fluorogel (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and visualized 
using a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope. Images were analyzed 
using ImageJ version 2.0
Pull-down assay
Pulldown of Gpr158 was performed in solubilized mem-
branes from Ocn−/− or Gpr158−/− hippocampi. Hippo-
campi were dissected on ice and homogenized in buffer A 
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 320 mM sucrose, 1× protease, and 
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail [78443; Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific]) with a Glass/T
eflon Potter Elvehjem homogenizer 
(20 strokes). Homogenized hippocampi were centrifuged 
at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Then, supernatants were ul-
tracentrifuged at 40,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Pellets were 
resuspended in buffer A supplemented with 150 mM NaCl 
and 1% n-Octyl β-D-thioglucopyranoside (28310; Thermo 
Fisher Scientific). Solubilized membranes were diluted in 
buffer A supplemented with 150 mM NaCl and 0.2% n-Oc-
tyl β-D-thioglucopyranoside. Recombinant uncarboxylated 
OCN was biotynalated using the EZ-Link NHS-PEO4 bio-
tynalation kit (21455; Thermo Fisher Scientific) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the pulldown, bioti-
nylated OCN (7 μg) was incubated for 2 h at 4°C. 
Thirty mi-
croliters of Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (11205D; 
Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) were added for 30 min at room tempera-
ture followed by three PBS 1× washes. Purified proteins were 
eluted from the beads by adding Laemmli protein buffer and 
heated at 65°C for 15 min and analyzed by Western blot.
Behavioral tests
All animals of the same batch were born within an interval 
of 2 wk and were kept in mixed genotype or groups of two 
to five females in the same cage, at standard laboratory condi-
tions (12-h dark/light cycle, constant room temperature and 
humidity, and standard laboratory chow and water ad libi-
tum). For each test, mice were transported a short distance 
from the holding mouse facility to the testing room in their 
home cages. Behavioral testing was performed between 3 and 
16 mo of age, and mouse weight was between 22 and 32 g. 
The tests were performed by an experimentalist blind to the 
genotypes or treatment of the mice under study.
ePMt. 
 This test takes advantage of the aversion of rodents to 
open spaces. The elevated plus maze apparatus comprises two 
open and two enclosed arms, each with an open roof, ele-
vated 60 cm from the floor (Holmes et al., 2000; Lira et al., 
2003). T
esting takes place in dim ambient light conditions. 
Animals are placed into the central area facing one closed arm 
and allowed to explore the elevated plus maz for 6 min. The 
total number of arm entries and time spent in open arms is 
recorded. An increase in anxiety is indicated by a decrease in 
the proportion of time spent in the open arms (time in open 
arms/total time in open or closed arms) and a decrease in the 
proportion of entries into the open arms.
light-to-dark transition test. 
 This test is based on the innate 
aversion of rodents to brightly illuminated areas and on their 
spontaneous exploratory behavior in response to the stressor 
that light represents. The test apparatus consists of a dark, safe 
compartment and an illuminated, aversive one. Mice were 
tested for 6 min, and two parameters were recorded: time 
spent in the lit compartment and the number of transitions 
between compartments, indices of anxiety-related behavior 
and exploratory activity.
oFt. 
 This test takes advantage of the aversion of rodents to 
brightly lit areas (David et al., 2009). Each mouse is placed in 
the center of the OFT chamber (a white 43 × 43 cm cham-
ber) and allowed to explore for 30 min. Mice were monitored 
throughout each test session by video recording and analyzed 
using autotyping (Patel et al., 2014). The overall motor activ-
ity was quantified as the total distance traveled (ambulation). 
Anxiety was quantified by measuring the time spent in the 
center of the OFT chamber.
Morris water maze test. 
 Animals were transported to the test-
ing room in their home cages and left undisturbed for at least 
30 min before the first trial. The maze was comprised of a 
large swimming pool (150 cm in diameter) filled with water 
(23°C) made opaque with nontoxic white paint. The pool 
was located in a brightly lit room filled with visual cues, in-

cluding geometric figures on the walls of the maze demark-
ing the four fixed starting positions of the trials, at 12 o’clock, 
3 o’clock, 6 o’clock, and 9 o’clock. A 15-cm round platform 
was hidden 1 cm beneath the surface of the water at a fixed 
position. Each daily trial block consisted of four swimming 
trials, with each mouse starting from the same randomly cho-
sen starting position. 
The starting position was varied between 
days. On day 1, mice that failed to find the platform within 2 
min were guided to the platform. They were required to re-
main on the platform for 15 s before they were returned to 
their home cages. Mice were not guided to the platform after 
day 1, and the time it took them to reach the platform over 
repeated trials (three trials each day for the next 10 d) was 
recorded as a measure of spatial learning.
nor test. 
 The NOR paradigm assesses a rodent’s ability to 
recognize a novel object in the environment. The NOR task 
was conducted, as previously described (Broadbent et al., 
2010), in an opaque plastic box using two different objects: (a) 
a clear plastic funnel (diameter 8.5 cm, maximal height 8.5 
cm) and (b) a black plastic box (9.5 cm3). These objects elicit 
equal levels of exploration as determined in pilot experiments 
(Denny et al., 2012; Oury et al., 2013). The NOR paradigm 
consists of three exposures over the course of 3 d. On day 1, 
the habituation phase, mice are given 5 min to explore the 
empty arena, without any objects. On day 2, the familiariza-
tion phase, mice are given 10 min to explore two identical 
objects, placed at opposite ends of the box. On day 3, the test 
phase, mice are given 15 min to explore two objects, one 
novel object and a copy of the object from the familiarization 
phase. The object that serves as the novel object (either the 
funnel or the box) as well as the left/right starting position of 
the objects is counterbalanced within each group. Mice are 
placed in the center of the arena at the start of each exposure. 
Between exposures, mice are held individually in standard 
cages, the objects and arenas are cleaned, and the bedding is 
replaced. Preference for the novel object is assessed on the 
basis of the fraction of time that a mouse spends exploring the 
novel object compared with the familiar object. Exploration 
is scored from video recordings of each exposure and scored 
using the Stopwatch program. Climbing or sitting adjacent to 
the object were not counted as exploration. An equal explo-
ration time for the two objects, or a decreased percentage of 
time spent with the novel object compared with 
WT controls 
indicates impairment in hippocampal memory. For this test, 
discrimination index ([time spent with novel object − time 
spent with old object]/total exploration time) and preference 
index (time spent with novel object/total exploration time) 
 
were measured.
contextual fear conditioning. 
 The conditioning apparatus 
consisted of sound-attenuating conditioning boxes (Bioseb), 
and mice were run individually in the conditioning boxes. 
The floor of the chamber consisted of stainless steel bars 
wired to a shock generator with a scrambler for the delivery 
of foot shock. Signal generated by mouse movement was re-
corded and analyzed by a high-sensitivity weight transducer 
system. The fear-conditioning procedure took place over two 
consecutive days. On day 1, mice were placed in the condi-
tioning chamber and received three foot shocks (1 s, 0.5 mA), 
which were administered at time points of 60, 120, and 180 s 
after the animals were placed in the chamber. They were re-
turned to their home cage 60 s after the final shock. Contex-
tual fear memory was assessed 24 h after conditioning by 
returning the mice to the conditioning chamber and measur-
ing freezing behavior during a 4-min retention test. Freezing 
was scored and analyzed automatically using Packwin soft-
ware version 2.0 (Bioseb). Freezing behavior was considered 
to occur if the animals froze for a period of at least 2 s.
electrophysiology
Coronal brain slices containing the hippocampus were pre-
pared from WT and Gpr158−/− mice (males, 3–4 wk old), 
as previously reported (Rao et al., 2007). In brief, mice were 
anesthetized with isoflurane and then decapitated to har-
vest brains, which were rapidly removed and immersed in 
an oxygenated cutting solution at 4°C containing 220 mM 
sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 6 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM 
NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM glucose and ad-
justed to pH 7.3 with NaOH. Coronal slices containing the 
hippocampus (350 µm thick) were cut with a vibratome and 
trimmed to contain just the hippocampus. After preparation, 
slices were stored in a holding chamber at room temperature 
(22–25°C) with oxygenated (5% CO2 and 95% O2) artifi-
cial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 124 mM NaCl, 
3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 1.23 mM NaH2PO4, 
26 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. 
The slices were eventually transferred to a recording chamber 
continuously perfused with ACSF at 33°C at a rate of 2 ml/
min for at least a 1 h to allow recovery before the start of 
patch-clamp recording. Whole-cell current clamp was per-
formed to observe spontaneous APs in visually identified 
pyramidal neurons in the CA3 area of the hippocampus, as re-
ported by Kim and Connors (2012), with a Multiclamp 700 A 
 
amplifier (Molecular Devices). The patch pipettes with a tip 
resistance of 4–6 MΩ were made of borosilicate glass (World 
Precision Instruments) with a pipette puller (Sutter P-97) 
and back filled with a pipette solution containing 135 mM 
K-gluconate, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 1.1 mM EGTA, 
2 mM Mg-ATP
, 10 mM Na2-phosphocreatine, and 0.3 mM 
Na2-GTP
, pH 7.3, with KOH. After a stable base of APs were 
recorded for 10 min, OCN was applied to the recorded cells 
through bath application at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for 
10 min and then washed out with ACSF
. Both input resis-
tance and series resistance were monitored throughout the 
experiments. Only recordings with stable series resistance 
were accepted (the change in series resistance was less than 
20%). In LTP experiments, fEPSPs were recorded in the CA3 
area with a glass pipette filled with ACSF (with a tip resistance 
of 2–4 MΩ) by stimulating the MF in the dentate gyrus area 
 2871
JEM Vol. 214, No. 10
with a bipolar electrode. The amplitude of fEPSPs was always 
adjusted to 40% of the maximum value before the starting of 
LTP experiments. T
wo trains of high-frequency stimuli (100 
Hz, 1-s duration, 10-s interval) were delivered to the MF after 
a stable baseline recording of fEPSPs was achieved, as rou-
tinely reported by others (Spillane et al., 1995). 
The amplitude 
of fEPSPs was normalized to the mean amplitude of fEPSPs 
recorded before high-frequency stimulations, as reported by 
others (Spillane et al., 1995). All data were sampled at 10 kHz 
and filtered at 6 kHz with an Apple Macintosh computer 
using Axograph X (AxoGraph Scientific). APs were detected 
and analyzed with AxoGraph X and plotted with Igor Pro 
software (WaveMetrics), as described previously (Rao et al., 
2007). 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (1224; T
ocris Biosci-
ence) was used to inhibit IP3 receptor.
lentivirus production and shrnA sequences
The shRNA sequence 5′-GAG 
CCG 
CTC 
CAC 
TGA 
CGG 
CAC

CTT 
GG-3′ targeting mouse Gpr158 was pur-
chased from Origene (TL509693B). shRNA was cloned into 
pGFP-C-Lentivector (Origene). For virus production, human 
embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with VSVG, 
helper, and pGFP-C-shLentiVector (containing Gpr158 or 
scramble shRNA) plasmids. After 2 d, viral particles were pu-
rified and concentrated.
stereotaxic injection
Stereotaxic surgery was performed in 3-mo-old C57BL/6J 
male mice obtained from the Janvier Laboratory stock. 
Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 
a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg of body 
weight [BW]; 1000; Virbac) and 100 mg/ml BW xylazine 
(10 mg/kg of BW; Rompun 2%; Bayer) and placed in a 
stereotaxic frame (900SL-KOPF). Ophthalmic eye oint-
ment was applied to the cornea to prevent desiccation 
during surgery. The fur in the area surrounding the inci-
sion was trimmed, and Vetedine solution (Vétoquinol) was 
applied. Lentiviruses expressing shRNA targeting Gpr158 
or noneffective scramble shRNA in pGFP-C-shLentiVec-
tor were injected bilaterally into the anterior hippocampi 
([from bregma] anteroposterior = −2.0 mm, dorsal ven-
tral = ±1.4 mm, and medial lateral = −1.33 mm) using 
a 10-µl Hamilton syringe (1701RN) over either 12 or 4 
min (injection speed 0.25 µl/min). Three microliters of 
lentivirus expressing shRNA against Gpr158 (titer: 3.4 
× 109 GC/ml) or scramble shRNA (1.4 × 109 GC/ml) 
were injected. To limit reflux along the injection track, the 
needle was maintained in place for 4 min between each 
1-µl injection. Then, the skin was closed using silk suture 
and the mice were injected locally with surgical analgesic 
(ketoprofen). Two weeks after the lentivirus injection, bi-
lateral stereotaxic injections of OCN (10 ng/µl) or NaCl 
was performed into the anterior hippocampi at the same 
stereotaxic coordinate. Twelve hours after the stereotaxic 
injections of OCN, mice were subjected to the training 
phase (NOR and contextual fear conditioning) and to the 
testing phase 24 h following the habituation phase.
live-cell imaging of BdnF axonal trafficking 
in microfluidic devices
Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from E17.5 
WT rats. Dissociated neurons were resuspended in grow-
ing medium (Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% 
B27, 2 mM Glutamax, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) 
and seeded in the upper chamber of microchambers pre-
pared according to Zala et al. (2013) at a final density of 
7,000 cells/mm2. Three hours after seeding, neurons were 
infected with 3.105 UI of lentivirus carrying pCMV- 
BDNF-mCherry constructs and cultured for 9 to 11 d at 
37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Neurons were treated or not 
for 4 h with 10 ng/ml OCN added in the upper cham-
ber and imaged. Videomicroscopy acquisitions of 100-µm 
axon length were done on the lower part of channels, far 
enough from dendrites, at 5 Hz for 30 s with an inverted 
microscope (AxioObserver Z1; Zeiss) coupled to a spin-
ning-disk confocal system (CSU-W1-T3; Yokogawa) con-
nected to an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device 
camera (ProEM+1024; Princeton Instrument) at 37°C and 
5% CO2. BDNF-mCherry positive mean vesicle velocity 
per axon, vesicle number per 100 µm length axon over 
30 s, percentage of vesicle pausing time, and directional 
net flux (mean velocity × number of anterograde vesicles 
per axon − mean velocity × number of retrograde vesicles 
per axon) were extracted from kymographs (x axis, 100 
µm; y axis, 30 s) using the KymoTool Box ImageJ plugin 
as previously described (Zala et al., 2013). Each condition 
was tested using 3 microchambers per culture and three in-
dependent cultures. In each chamber, three fields contain-
ing at least four axons were analyzed to reach a minimum 
number of 100 axons (1,400 vesicles).
Quantification and statistical analysis
All values are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical param-
eters including the exact sample size (n), post hoc tests, and 
statistical significance are reported in every figure and figure 
legend. Number of mice were estimated to be sufficient on 
the basis of pilot experiments and previously published work 
(Oury et al., 2013). Data were estimated to be statistically sig-
nificant when P ≤ 0.05 by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U 
test, Student’s t test, one-way ANO 
VA, or two-way ANO 
VA. 
In every figure, an asterisk denotes statistical significance (*, 
P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001). Data were analyzed 
using GraphPad Prism 6.
