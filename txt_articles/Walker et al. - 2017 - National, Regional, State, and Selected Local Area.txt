The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommends that adolescents routinely receive tetanus, diph-
theria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), and human papillomavirus 
(HPV) vaccine (1) at age 11–12 years. ACIP also recom-
mends catch-up vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, measles, 
mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and varicella vaccine for 
adolescents who are not up to date with childhood vaccina-
tions. ACIP recommends a booster dose of MenACWY at age 
16 years (1). In December 2016, ACIP updated HPV vaccine 
recommendations to include a 2-dose schedule for immuno-
competent adolescents initiating the vaccination series before 
their 15th birthday (2). To estimate adolescent vaccination cov-
erage in the United States, CDC analyzed data from the 2016 
National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen) for 20,475 
adolescents aged 13–17 years.* During 2015–2016, coverage 
increased for ≥1 dose of Tdap (from 86.4% to 88.0%) and for 
each HPV vaccine dose (from 56.1% to 60.4% for ≥1 dose). 
Among adolescents aged 17 years, coverage with ≥2 doses of 
MenACWY increased from 33.3% to 39.1%. In 2016, 43.4% 
of adolescents (49.5% of females; 37.5% of males) were up to 
date with the HPV vaccination series, applying the updated 
HPV vaccine recommendations retrospectively.† Coverage with 
* Eligible participants were born during January 1998–February 2004. Tetanus, 
diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) represents coverage with ≥1 Tdap 
dose at age ≥10 years. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) represents 
coverage with the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine or 
meningococcal-unknown type vaccine. Coverage with meningococcal type B 
vaccine is not included in 2016 National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen) 
vaccination coverage estimates. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination 
coverage includes receipt of any HPV vaccine and does not distinguish between 
nine-valent (9vHPV), quadrivalent (4vHPV), or bivalent (2vHPV) vaccines. 
Some adolescents might have received more than the 2 or 3 recommended HPV 
vaccine doses. Estimates for hepatitis B and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines 
represent coverage based on the catch-up schedule for adolescents who are not 
up to date with these vaccinations. Except as noted, coverage estimates for ≥1 
and ≥2 varicella vaccine doses were obtained among adolescents with no history 
of varicella disease. Influenza vaccination coverage data are not included in this 
report but are available online at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/index.htm.
† Most of the vaccination data for adolescents surveyed in the 2016 NIS-Teen 
were collected before publication of the 2-dose HPV schedule. However, the 
HPV up-to-date status of these adolescents was assessed to estimate what 
proportion would not need further HPV vaccination doses under the updated 
schedule. Adolescents were considered to be up to date with HPV vaccination 
if they had received ≥3 doses, or if each of the following applied: 1) they had 
received 2 doses; 2) the first dose was received before their 15th birthday; and 
3) the difference between dates of first and second doses was ≥5 months minus 
4 days, the absolute minimum interval between the first and second doses 
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/cdsi.html).
≥1 HPV vaccine dose varied by metropolitan statistical area 
(MSA) status and was lowest (50.4%) among adolescents living 
in non-MSA areas and highest (65.9%) among those living in 
MSA central cities.§ Adolescent vaccination coverage continues 
to improve overall; however, substantial opportunities exist to 
further increase HPV-associated cancer prevention.
NIS-Teen is an annual survey that collects data on vaccines 
received by adolescents aged 13–17 years in the 50 states, the 
District of Columbia, selected local areas, and territories.¶ 
NIS-Teen is conducted among parents and guardians of eligible 
adolescents identified using a random-digit–dialed sample of 
landline and cellular telephone numbers.** Parents and guard-
ians are interviewed for information on the sociodemographic 
characteristics of the adolescent and household, and contact 
information for the child’s vaccination providers. If more than 
one age-eligible adolescent lives in the household, one ado-
lescent is randomly selected for participation. With parental/
guardian consent, health care providers identified during the 
interview are mailed a questionnaire requesting the vaccination 
history from the adolescent’s medical record.†† This report 
 § Metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status was determined based on household-
reported county of residence, and was grouped into three categories: MSA 
central city, MSA non-central city, and non-MSA. MSA and central city were 
as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/
gtc/gtc_cbsa.html). Non-MSA areas include urban populations not located 
within an MSA as well as completely rural areas.
 ¶ Local areas that received federal Section 317 immunization funds were sampled 
separately: Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Philadelphia County, 
Pennsylvania; Bexar County, Texas; and Houston, Texas. Two local areas were 
oversampled: El Paso County, Texas and Dallas County, Texas. Three territories 
were sampled separately in 2016: Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
** All identified cellular-telephone households were eligible for interview. 
Sampling weights were adjusted for dual-frame (landline and cellular 
telephone), nonresponse, noncoverage, and overlapping samples of mixed 
telephone users. A description of NIS-Teen dual-frame survey methodology 
and its effect on reported vaccination estimates is available at https://www.
cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/nis/child/dual-frame-sampling.html.
 
†† For the telephone samples for the states and local areas, the overall Council of 
American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) response rate was 32.7% (55.5% 
for the landline sample and 29.5% for the cellular telephone sample). For adolescents 
with completed interviews, 48.4% had adequate provider data (53.9% landline 
sample, 47.4% cell sample). Among completed interviews with adequate provider 
data, 23% (4,684) were from the landline sample and 77% (15,791) were from the 
cellular telephone sample. For territories, the overall CASRO response rates were 
31.5% for Guam, 33.2% for Puerto Rico, and 44.4% for the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
The CASRO response rate is the product of three other rates: 1) the resolution rate 
(the proportion of telephone numbers that can be identified as either for business 
or residence); 2) the screening rate (the proportion of qualified households that 
complete the screening process); and 3) the cooperation rate (the proportion of 
contacted eligible households for which a completed interview is obtained).

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
presents vaccination coverage estimates for 20,475 adolescents 
(9,661 females and 10,814 males) aged 13–17 years with 
adequate provider data.§§ NIS-Teen methodology, including 
methods for weighting and synthesizing provider-reported vac-
cination histories, has been described (https://www.cdc.gov/
vaccines/imz-managers/nis/downloads/NIS-PUF15-DUG.
pdf). T-tests were used for statistical comparison of weighted 
data to account for the complex survey design. Weighted linear 
regression by survey year was used to estimate annual percent-
age point increases. Differences were considered statistically 
significant for p-values <0.05.
National Vaccination Coverage
In 2016, ≥1-dose HPV vaccination coverage among teens 
was 60.4% (65.1% for females; 56.0% for males), and 43.4% 
were up to date with the recommended HPV vaccination 
series (49.5% for females; 37.5% for males) (Table 1). During 
2015–2016, HPV vaccination coverage increased for ≥1 dose 
by 4.3 percentage points overall (6.2 for males), for ≥2 doses 
by 3.8 percentage points (2.8 for females; 4.6 for males), and 
for ≥3 doses by 2.2 percentage points (3.4 for males) (Table 1) 
(Figure 1). Also during 2015–2016, coverage with ≥1 Tdap 
dose increased by 1.6 percentage points to 88.0%; among 
adolescents without a history of varicella disease, coverage with 
≥2 varicella vaccine doses increased by 2.5 percentage points 
to 85.6%; and among persons aged 17 years, coverage with 
≥2 MenACWY doses increased by 5.8 percentage points to 
39.1% (Table 1) (Figure 1).
Vaccination Coverage by Selected Characteristics
Tdap and MenACWY coverage was similar for each age 
group. For HPV vaccination (≥1-dose, ≥2-dose, and ≥3-dose 
coverage, and up-to-date status) coverage was higher overall 
and by sex, for persons aged 17 years (e.g., ≥1-dose cover-
age was 65.4% versus 53.5% at age 13 years), except for HPV 
up-to-date status among males, which was highest among males 
aged 16 years (Table 1). Among adolescents aged 13 years, 
HPV vaccination coverage was similar for females and males; 
among adolescents aged 17 years, HPV vaccination coverage 
was 14–23 percentage points higher among females than 
among males (Table 1).
Differences in vaccination coverage by race/ethnic-
ity in 2016 were similar to patterns observed in previous 
years (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/47510) (3). Coverage with Tdap, MenACWY, MMR vac-
cine, hepatitis B vaccine, and ≥2 doses of varicella vaccine did 
 
§§ Adolescents from Guam (242 females and 293 males), Puerto Rico (197 
females and 208 males), and the U.S. Virgin Islands (201 females and 227 
males) were excluded from the national estimates.
not differ by poverty status¶¶ (Table 2); however, HPV cover-
age, overall and by sex, was higher among adolescents living 
below the federal poverty level than among those living at or 
above the poverty level (e.g., overall, 12.9 percentage points 
and 8.4 percentage points higher for ≥1-dose coverage and up-
to-date status, respectively). HPV coverage, overall and by sex, 
was 13–17 percentage points lower for adolescents living in 
non-MSA areas and 5–8 percentage points lower among those 
living in MSA non-central city areas than among those living 
in MSA central cities (Table 2). Coverage with ≥1 MenACWY 
dose and ≥2 varicella vaccine doses were 9.5 percentage points 
and 4.5 percentage points, respectively, lower among adoles-
cents living in non-MSA areas than among those living in MSA 
central cities. Adolescents living in non-MSA areas were more 
likely to have all reported vaccination providers from public 
facilities (30.4%) than were those living in MSA non-central 
cities (10.3%) or MSA central cities (14.4%) (Supplementary 
Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/47510).
State, Local, and Territorial Vaccination Coverage
Vaccination coverage varied by state (Table 3). For 
example, coverage with ≥1 Tdap dose ranged from 77.5% 
in South Carolina to 96.7% in Massachusetts, and ≥1-dose 
MenACWY coverage ranged from 54.2% in Wyoming to 
96.4% in Rhode Island. Among females, ≥1-dose HPV vac-
cination coverage ranged from 47.8% in Mississippi to 90.1% 
in Rhode Island (Table 3) (Figure 2); among males, ≥1-dose 
HPV coverage ranged from 36.9% in Indiana and Wyoming to 
87.8% in Rhode Island (Table 3) (Figure 3). HPV up-to-date 
estimates among females ranged from 30.8% in South Carolina 
to 73.0% in Rhode Island, and among males, from 19.9% in 
Wyoming to 68.7% in Rhode Island. During 2013–2016, 
≥1-dose HPV vaccination coverage increased an average of 
5.0 percentage points per year nationally; among states, local 
areas, and territories, the greatest statistically significant aver-
age annual increases were in New York City (7.7 percentage 
points), Nevada (7.6), Maryland (7.4), Guam (7.3), New York 
(7.2), and Alaska (7.1) (Supplementary Table 3, https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/47510).
Discussion
In 2016, adolescent vaccination coverage in the United 
States was sustained and continued to improve in several areas: 
compared with 2015, coverage with Tdap, ≥2 doses of varicella 
 
¶¶ Adolescents were classified as below the federal poverty level if their total 
family income was less than the federal poverty level specified for the applicable 
family size and number of children aged <18 years. All others were classified 
as at or above the poverty level. Poverty status was unknown for 724 
adolescents. https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-

of MenACWY at or after age 16 years; HPV vaccine, nine-valent (9vHPV), quadrivalent (4vHPV) or bivalent (2vHPV).  ACIP recommends 9vHPV, 4vHPV or 2vHPV for 
females and 9vHPV or 4vHPV for males.  The routine ACIP recommendation was made for females in 2006 and for males in 2011.
† NIS-Teen implemented a revised APD definition in 2014, and retrospectively applied the revised APD definition to 2013 data.  Estimates using different APD definitions 
might not be directly comparable.  
vaccination initiation (receipt of ≥1 HPV vaccine dose) con-
tinues to increase, coverage remains 22–28 percentage points 
lower than those for Tdap and ≥1-dose MenACWY. These 
gaps indicate substantial opportunity for improving HPV 
vaccination practices.
Disparities in adolescent vaccination coverage were found 
by MSA status: HPV vaccination initiation among adolescents 
living outside MSA central cities was 16 percentage points 
lower than among those living in MSA central cities. Although 
adolescents living in non-MSA areas had substantially lower 
HPV and MenACWY vaccination coverage compared with 
those living in MSA central cities, Tdap coverage in these 
groups was similar. Reasons for these disparities are not well 
understood. Potential contributing factors might include dif-
ferences in parental acceptance of certain vaccines and provider 
participation in, and adolescents’ eligibility for, the Vaccines for 
Children program.*** The disproportionately lower number 
of pediatric primary care providers found in non-MSA areas 
than in MSA central city areas (4,5) might partially explain 
 *** Children aged ≤18 years who are Medicaid-eligible, uninsured, or American 
Indian/Alaska Native (as defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement 
Act) are eligible to receive vaccines from providers through the Vaccines for 
Children (VFC) program. Children categorized as “underinsured” (because 
their health plans do not include coverage for recommended vaccinations) are 
eligible to receive VFC vaccines if they are served by a rural health clinic or 
federally qualified health center or under an approved deputization agreement.

 * Adolescents (N = 20,475) in the 2016 NIS-Teen were born during January 1998–February 2004.
 
† Adolescents were classified as below poverty level if their total family income was less than the federal poverty level specified for the applicable family size and 
number of children aged <18 years. All others were classified as at or above the poverty level (https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-
poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html). Poverty status was unknown for 724 adolescents.
 
§ MSA status was determined based on household-reported county of residence, and was grouped into three categories: MSA central city, MSA non-central city, 
and non-MSA. MSA and central city were as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_cbsa.html). Non-MSA areas include 
urban populations not located within an MSA as well as completely rural areas.
 
¶ Estimates with 95% CI half-widths >10 might not be reliable.
 ** Includes percentages receiving Tdap vaccine at age ≥10 years.
 †† Includes percentages receiving MenACWY and meningococcal-unknown type vaccine.
 §§ Statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in estimated vaccination coverage by poverty level or metropolitan statistical area; referent groups were adolescents 
living at or above poverty level and MSA central city, respectively.
 ¶¶ ≥2 doses of MenACWY or meningococcal-unknown type vaccine. Calculated only among adolescents aged 17 years at time of interview. Does not include 
adolescents who received 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at age ≥16 years.
 
*** HPV vaccine, nine-valent (9vHPV), quadrivalent (4vHPV), or bivalent (2vHPV). For ≥1-, ≥2-, and ≥3-dose measures, percentages are reported among females and 
males combined (n = 20,475) and for females only (n = 9,661) and males only (n = 10,814).

this difference in vaccination coverage, because nonpediatric 
providers might be less familiar with adolescent vaccination rec-
ommendations. Because Tdap coverage is substantially higher 
than ≥1-dose HPV coverage, even in non-MSA areas, lack of 
access to any vaccination services is unlikely the underlying 
cause of lower HPV vaccine initiation. A better understanding 
of reasons for variations in HPV vaccine initiation by MSA 
status is needed to identify appropriate, targeted strategies to 
improve HPV vaccination coverage. CDC has published a 
series of reports in an effort to better understand health dis-
parities between rural and urban areas (https://www.cdc.gov/
ruralhealth/caseforruralhealth.html).
Variation in adolescent vaccination coverage among state 
and local areas might reflect differences in adolescent health 
care delivery, the prevalence of factors associated with lower 
vaccination coverage, and immunization program emphasis 
on, and effectiveness of, adolescent vaccination activities. 
Immunization programs in several state and local jurisdic-
tions (e.g., Alaska, Maryland, Nevada, New York, and New 
York City), although not necessarily having the highest HPV 
vaccination coverage in the nation, have experienced annual 
increases in coverage that exceed the national average over 
a 4-year period. Activities contributing to this success, as 
reported by these immunization programs, include enhanc-
ing provider education, assessing vaccination coverage lev-
els in health care provider offices and providing feedback 
to the practices, conducting media campaigns, engaging 
community partners, and experiencing a “spillover” effect 
from middle school vaccination requirements for Tdap and 
MenACWY vaccines.

At the end of 2016, the recommended HPV vaccination

immunocompetent adolescents initiating the series before 
their 15th birthday. Three doses are recommended for per-
sons initiating the series at ages 15 through 26 years and for 
immunocompromised persons (2). The recommendation 
allows for 1 fewer dose and one fewer visit to a health care 
provider, which might encourage providers to promote, 
and parents to accept, vaccination at the recommended 
age of 11–12 years. Although it is too early to assess the 
direct impact of the revised recommendation on vaccination 
practices, when applied retrospectively, the HPV up-to-date 
coverage was 6.3 percentage points higher than the ≥3-dose 
HPV coverage.

Each year in the United States, an estimated 31,500 newly 
diagnosed cancers in men and women are attributable to HPV; 
approximately 90% of these could be prevented by receipt of 
the nine-valent HPV vaccine (https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/
hpv/statistics/cases.htm). Although it is too early to observe 
the impact of HPV vaccination on HPV-associated cancers, 
impact on infection with HPV types targeted by the vaccine 
and other endpoints have been reported (6–8). Data from 
the 2007–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Surveys indicate that, compared with 2003–2006 (before HPV 
vaccine introduction), prevalence of HPV types targeted by the 
quadrivalent HPV vaccine††† in cervicovaginal specimens had 
decreased 56% (from 11.5% to 5.0%) among females aged 
14–19 years (6). By 2011–2014, prevalence had declined 71% 
(from 11.5% to 3.3%) among females aged 14–19 years and 
61% (from 18.5% to 7.2%) among females aged 20–24 years 
(7). Evidence of vaccine impact among males also exists (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five 
limitations. First, the overall household response rate was 
32.7% (55.5% for the landline and 29.5% for the cell phone 
samples), and only 53.9% of landline-completed and 47.4% 
of cell phone–completed interviews had adequate provider 
 ††† Most HPV vaccine used in the United States before licensure of the nine-
valent vaccine at the end of 2014 was quadrivalent HPV vaccine.

data. Second, bias in estimates might remain even after adjust-
ment for household and provider nonresponse and phoneless 
households.¶¶¶ Weights have been adjusted for the increasing 
number of cell phone–only households over time. Nonresponse 
bias might change, which could affect comparisons of estimates 
between survey years. Third, estimates stratified by state/local 
area might be unreliable because of small sample sizes. Fourth, 
multiple statistical tests were conducted, and a small number 
might be significant because of chance alone. Finally, ≥2-dose 
MenACWY coverage likely underestimates the proportion of 
adolescents who receive ≥2 MenACWY doses. Adolescents 
might receive a booster dose of MenACWY after age 17 years 
(1); because NIS-Teen includes adolescents aged 13–17 years, 
receipt of MenACWY at age ≥18 years cannot be captured in 
coverage estimates.
Adolescent vaccination coverage can be increased, and the 
gap between HPV vaccination coverage and coverage with 
Tdap and ≥1-dose MenACWY can be closed with increased 
implementation of effective strategies. Providers should use 
every visit to review vaccination histories, provide strong

incomplete sample frame, nonresponse bias, and incomplete ascertainment 
of vaccination status, estimates of Tdap, ≥1-dose meningococcal conjugate, 
and ≥1-dose HPV vaccination coverage were estimated to be lower than 
actual values by 1–3 percentage points. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
To protect against vaccine-preventable diseases, including 
human papillomavirus (HPV)–associated cancers, diphtheria, 
pertussis, tetanus, and meningococcal disease, routine 
immunization of adolescents aged 11–12 years is recom-
mended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
(ACIP). Since HPV vaccine introduction in 2006 for females and 
2011 for males, coverage has increased gradually for females 
and more rapidly for males, although coverage has not reached 
the tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) 
and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine 
(MenACWY) coverage.
What is added by this report?
In December 2016, ACIP updated HPV vaccination recommenda-
tions to include a 2-dose schedule for immunocompetent 
adolescents initiating the vaccine series before their 15th 
birthday; 3 doses are recommended for persons who initiate the 
series at age 15–26 years and for immunocompromised persons. 
A new HPV up-to-date measure was added to the 2016 National 
Immunization Survey–Teen to account for the revised HPV 
vaccination schedule. HPV up-to-date estimates were 49.5% for 
females and 37.5% for males and 6.0–6.5 percentage points 
higher than ≥3-dose adolescent HPV coverage. HPV up-to-date 
vaccination coverage was 15 percentage points lower among 
adolescents living in nonmetropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) 
than among adolescents living in MSA central cities.
What are the implications for public health care?
Adolescent vaccination coverage continues to improve, but 
opportunity remains to increase HPV-associated cancer 
prevention. A better understanding of reasons for differences in 
HPV vaccination by MSA status might identify appropriate 
strategies to improve coverage. Protection against vaccine-
preventable diseases will be increased if clinicians consistently 
recommend and simultaneously administer Tdap, MenACWY, 
and HPV vaccines at age 11–12 years.
clinical recommendations for HPV and other recommended 
vaccines, and implement systems to eliminate or minimize 
missed opportunities (e.g., standing orders, provider reminders, 
patient reminder or recall, and use of immunization informa-
tion systems) (https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/
vaccination). Resources for clinicians to facilitate effective 
communication with parents and adolescents regarding HPV 
and other recommended vaccines are available at https://www.
cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/index.html. Provider-based performance 
measurement could also facilitate increased adolescent vaccina-
tion coverage, including the Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, 
and eXchange program implemented by state and local 
immunization programs with individual providers (https://
www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/afix/index.html), and the 
2018 updated Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information 
Set composite measure for health plans, assessing receipt of 
Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV vaccines by age 13 years (http://
www.ncqa.org/hedis-quality-measurement/hedis-measures/
hedis-2018). Protection against vaccine-preventable diseases 
will be increased if clinicians consistently recommend and 
simultaneously administer Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV vac-
cines at age 11–12 years.
