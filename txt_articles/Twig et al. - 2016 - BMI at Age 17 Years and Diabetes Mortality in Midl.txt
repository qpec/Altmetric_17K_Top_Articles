Mortality in Midlife: A Nationwide
Cohort of 2.3 Million Adolescents
Diabetes Care 2016;39:1996–2003 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-1203
OBJECTIVE
The sequelae of increasing childhood obesity are of major concern. We as-
sessed the association of BMI in late adolescence with diabetes mortality in
midlife.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The BMI values of 2,294,139 Israeli adolescents (age 17.4 6 0.3 years), measured
between 1967 and 2010, were grouped by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention age/sex percentiles and by ordinary BMI values. The outcome,
obtained by linkage with official national records, was death attributed to
diabetes mellitus (DM) as the underlying cause. Cox proportional hazards models
were applied.
RESULTS
During 42,297,007 person-years of follow-up (median, 18.4 years; range <1–44
years) there were 481 deaths from DM (mean age at death, 50.6 6 6.6 years).
There was a graded increase in DM mortality evident from the 25th to the 49th
BMI percentile group onward and from a BMI of 20.0–22.4 kg/m2 onward. Over-
weight (85th to 94th percentiles) and obesity (the 95th percentile or higher),
compared with the 5th to 24th percentiles, were associated with hazard ratios
(HRs) of 8.0 (95% CI 5.7–11.3) and 17.2 (11.9–24.8) for DM mortality, respectively,
after adjusting for sex, age, birth year, height, and sociodemographic variables.
The HR for the 50th through 74th percentiles was 1.6 (95% CI 1.1–2.3). Findings
persisted in a series of sensitivity analyses. The estimated population-attributable
fraction for DM mortality, 31.2% (95% CI 26.6–36.1%) for the 1967–1977 preva-
lence of overweight and obesity at age 17, rose to a projected 52.1% (95% CI 46.4–
57.4%) for the 2012–2014 prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS
Adolescent BMI, including values within the currently accepted “normal” range,
strongly predicts DM mortality up to the seventh decade. The increasing preva-
lence of childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity points to a substan-
tially increased future adult DM burden.
The increasing global prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) (1) has been accompanied
by a substantial increase in the burden of mortality. It is estimated that between
1990 and 2010, the total number of deaths attributable to coronary heart disease in-
creased by 25%, whereas DM mortality nearly doubled (2), with predictions for a further
increase (3).

EPIDEMIOLOGY/HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
 The most important modifiable risk
factor for diabetes morbidity and mor-
tality is excessive weight (4,5). While
there is increasingly compelling evi-
dence for the contribution of obesity
during childhood and adolescence to fu-
ture cardiometabolic morbidity (6–9)
and mortality (10–13), less is known
about the contribution of BMI in the
so-called normal range to diabetes mor-
tality. This question is of importance,
particularly given the global increase in
BMI (13,14) and recent evidence from
this cohort showing that adolescent
BMI already at the 50th percentile
(and $20 kg/m2) is associated with
substantially increased risk for future
cardiovascular mortality, excess non-
cardiovascular mortality, and total
mortality (15,16). In light of the increase
in childhood and adolescent obesity and
the growing contribution of DM to total
mortality (2), determining the fraction of
DM mortality attributable to excessive
weight in adolescence is a public health
interest.
The goals of this study were to deter-
mine the association across the full
range of adolescent BMI with the risk
for DM mortality in midlife and to esti-
mate the population burden of DM mor-
tality attributable to adolescent BMI
and its secular increase.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Population
At the age of 17, service-eligible Israeli
citizens are called up for a medical ex-
amination to assess their suitability for
military service. Figure 1 portrays the
examination process and study design.
The study sample included all Israeli ad-
olescents (n = 2,454,693) who were
evaluated at ages 16–19 years between
1 January 1967 and 31 December 2010.
Excluded from this cohort were 64,186
examinees with missing BMI data and
92,377 examinees from non-Jewish mi-
norities who were nonrepresentative of
their source population (all Israeli Arabs
and Druze women are exempt from
military service), leaving 2,294,139 for
analysis. Orthodox and ultraorthodox
Jewish women are not obligated to serve,
may not be examined, and are under-
represented in this cohort, whereas the
sample of Jewish men can be regarded as
nationally representative. The institutional
review board of the Israel Defense Forces
Medical Corps approved this study.
Study Outcome and Documentation
of the Cause of Death
The primary outcome was death attrib-
uted to DM (see Fig. 1 for International
Classification of Diseases [ICD] codes).
Using the participants’ national identifi-
cation numbers, we linked the under-
lying cause of death, officially coded
from death notifications by the Israel
Central Bureau of Statistics according
to the ICD-9 (1981–1997) and ICD-10
(1998–2011) classifications, to the da-
tabase. Because cause of death was
available to us only from 1981 onward,
the follow-up of the main analysis com-
menced in 1981 and ceased on the date
of death from any cause or 30 June 2011,
whichever came first.
Data Collection and Study Variables
Trained medical personnel measured
height using a stadiometer and weight
using a beam balance at baseline. Exam-
inees wore only underwear. BMI was
calculated (weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared). Military
physicians who reviewed the participants’
medical records and provided diagnostic
codes where applicable conducted the
medical examination. Data regarding
education, residential socioeconomic
status (SES), and country of origin are
routinely recorded.
Age at examination, year of birth, and
height were treated as continuous vari-
ables. Education was divided into four
groups: #9, 10, 11, or 12 years of formal
schooling. Residential SES, based on local-
ity of residence at the time ofexamination,
was coded on a 1 to 10 scale (17) and was
grouped into high (8–10), medium (5–7)
and low (1–4) categories. Country of origin
(classifiedbytheexaminee’sfather’scoun-
try of birth [or the grandfather’s if the fa-
ther was born in Israel]) and country of
birthwereclassifiedaspreviouslyreported
(16). BMI was classified according to the
sex-specific U.S. Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) percentiles for
age (by month) (18), as shown in Table 1,
and in kilograms per meters squared by
World Health Organization groupings. Ta-
ble 1 displays the following subgroups:
BMI , 5th (underweight), 5th # BMI ,
25th, 25th # BMI , 50th, 50th # BMI ,
75th, 75th # BMI , 85th, 85th #
BMI , 95th (overweight), and BMI $ 95th
(obese).

among the 512,699 participants who were assessed between 1967 and 1980 and for which underlying

military trauma. MOH, Israel Ministry of Health.

 Statistical Analysis
Person-year mortality rates were calcu-
lated. We computed Kaplan-Meier sur-
vival curves for the BMI percentile study
groups, commencing in 1967. We used
Cox proportional hazard models to esti-
mate the unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs)
and 95% CIs for the association of BMI
and DM mortality, then we adjusted for
birth year, age at examination, and sex
(model 1). Covariates considered as pos-
sible confounders were added singly to
model 1. All variables selected as poten-
tial confounders and included in the
multivariable models showed signifi-
cant associations (P # 0.005) with DM
mortality (Supplementary Table 1) and
with BMI (except for height). The as-
sumption of the proportionality of the
hazards was confirmed for all variables.
We further analyzed the BMI-DM mor-
tality association using BMI classified in
kilograms per meters squared, given
that more than 98% of growth is com-
pleted by age 17 (19). Cox regression
spline models (SmoothHR and survival
packages, R software version 3.2.2) were
fit to estimate the BMI value associated
with minimum DM mortality risk. We ac-
countedforcompetingrisks(PROCPHREG,
SAS software version 9.4). Multiple impu-
tation algorithms were applied for missing
data on origin, education, and SES (1.4% of
the cohort) (SAS Miner version 13.1).
We calculated the population-attributable
risk percentage or fraction (PAF) of DM
mortality for being overweight or obese
($85th percentile), assuming a causal
relation between adolescent obesity
and DM mortality in adulthood: PAF =
Pe 3 (HR-1)/[Pe 3 (HR 2 1) + 1], where
HR is the adjusted HR of the relationship
between being overweight or obese
($85th percentile) and DM-related
death, and Pe is the prevalence of ado-
lescent overweight or obesity ($85th
CDC percentile) in the cohort. PAF was
calculated for the 1967–1977 period of
examination (which produced 86.7% of
the DM-related deaths) using the aver-
age Pe for that period. We applied the
average Pe for the 2012–2014 period of
examination to the HRs derived for the
1967–1977 examinees to obtain a pro-
jection of the PAF of future DM mortality
that would reflect the increased adoles-
cent obesity.
We performed a series of sensitivity
analyses (see details in RESULTS). Between
1967 and 1980, 3,991 deaths were re-
corded. Data on the underlying cause
of death for this period were not avail-
able to us, except for deaths that were
classified as military-related trauma, to
which 79.9% of deaths (n = 3,188) were
attributed. In addition, the underlying
cause was missing for 1,662 deaths
(5.2%) between 1981 and 2011. Of these
deaths, 60% occurred before the age of
40 years (n = 990), whereas only 6.7%
(n = 32) of all DM-related deaths oc-
curred before this age. We used SPSS
version 21.0 to analyze the data, unless
stated otherwise.
RESULTS
Table 1 displays the baseline character-
istics of the study cohort. The majority
of participants (86%) were examined at
age 17 years (mean age was similar for
both sexes, 17.3 6 0.4 years). Most par-
ticipants (85%) were born in Israel.
There is considerable diversity in their
countries of origin. Of the cohort, 75%
completed a high school education,
with the lowest prevalence evident
among the underweight group. Lower
residential SES was more prevalent
among both the underweight and obese
groups. Examinees of North African and
former U.S.S.R. origins tended to be
more overweight and obese, whereas
those of Asian origin (mostly from Iraq,
Iran, Syria, and Yemen) tended to have
lower BMIs.
Table 2 presents the follow-up char-
acteristics across the BMI percentile
groups. The median follow-up (18.4
years [interquartile range 9.9–29.3])
was lower for those with a higher BMI, a
consequence of the onset of increasing
overweight and obesity in our cohort in
the 1980s (16). During 42,297,007 person-
years of follow-up there were 481 deaths
attributed to DM from among all 32,127
deaths that were recorded in the co-
hort between 1981 and 2011. The pro-
portion of all deaths attributed to DM

1999
 (1.50%), as well as the leading causes of
death in our cohort, were similar to those
of comparable age-stratified groups in the
general Israeli population (Supplementary
Table 2). The vast majority of DM-related
deaths in the cohort (93.1%; n = 448) oc-
curred after 1997 and predominantly
among participants who were initially ex-
amined between 1967 and 1977 (86.7%;
n = 417).
DM mortality rates increased steeply
with age (Supplementary Table 3). The
mean age at death from DM (50.5 6 6.6
years) reflects the relatively young ages
ofthe cohort at termination ofthe follow-
up. Male sex, lower SES, lower education,
North African and former U.S.S.R. origin,
and shorter stature were associated with
higher risk (Supplementary Table 1).
There was a graded increase in the un-
adjusted person–time rate of DM mor-
tality evident in the midnormal (25th–
49th) BMI percentile onward, with a
12-fold higher mortality among the
obese ($95th BMI percentile) than the
5th–24th percentile group (0.618 vs.
0.052/105 person-years). Unadjusted
Cox proportional hazards modeling (Ta-
ble 2) closely followed the Kaplan-Meier
survival curves (Supplementary Fig. 1)
and reflected the same graded pattern:
the higher HRs associated with increas-
ing BMI became evident in the 25th–
49th percentiles. The association per-
sisted in minimally adjusted analyses
(that included age, birth year, and sex;
model 1) and upon further multivariable
adjustment (also adjusted for years of
education, SES, country of origin, and
height; model 2). In the full multivari-
able analysis, overweight and obesity
(vs. the 5th–24th percentiles) were as-
sociated with HRs for DM mortality of
8.0 (95% CI 5.7–11.3; P = 6.8 3 10232)
and 17.2 (95% CI 11.9–24.8; P = 1.6 3
10251), respectively. Mortality among
underweight participants was elevated,
but not significantly so, versus the 5th–
24th BMI percentiles (Table 2). The find-
ings persisted in a series of sensitivity
analyses including restriction of the anal-
ysis to adolescents with unimpaired
health status (Supplementary Table 4),
sex-specific analysis (Supplementary
Table 5), restriction to participants
examined between 1967 and 1977
(Supplementary Table 6), beginning the
follow-up in 1967 instead of 1981 (and
ignoring the small number of DM-related
deaths expected among deaths with
missing cause) (Supplementary Table 7),
and accounting for competing risks (deaths
other than from diabetes; Supplementary
Table 8). The association was attenuated
when the entire conventional normal
range (5th–84th BMI percentiles) was
used as the reference, with HRs of 4.9
(95% CI 3.9–6.1) and 10.3 (95% CI 7.9–
13.4) for overweight and obesity, re-
spectively, or 6.2 (95% CI 5.1–7.5) for
overweight and obesity grouped to-
gether (Supplementary Table 9).
To assess whether the association be-
tween adolescent BMI and the study
outcome differs by the age at death,
we analyzed separately DM-related
deaths occurring up to and after the
age of 50 years (Supplementary Table
10). The generally graded shape and
strength of the association between
BMI and DM-related death were similar
between the two age groups: for DM-
related deaths occurring after age 50,
significantly increased risk was evident
from the 25th BMI percentile onward,
whereas for DM deaths occurring at or
before age 50 years, increased risk was
evident above the 50th BMI percentile
(Supplementary Table 10). A sensitivity
analysis restricted to those who attained
at least the age of 35 years during follow-
up was consistent with the main analysis
(Supplementary Table 11).
The association between BMI and DM
mortality was accentuated when we ex-
cluded participants with a diagnosis of
diabetes at enrollment (2,417 partici-
pants [most likely type 1 DM], among
whom 10 deaths were attributed to
DM]; Supplementary Table 12), when
we excluded all deaths that were as-
signed to type 1 diabetes (n = 38; Supple-
mentaryTable 13), orwhenwe separately
analyzed deaths that were assigned to
type 2 diabetes (168 deaths, as coded
by the ICD-10 and that occurred from
1998 onward; Supplementary Table
14). Deaths assigned to diabetes of un-
specified cause (n = 265) showed sub-
stantial, though modestly weaker,
associations.
Upon grouping the cohort by absolute
BMI values (Table 2b), participants
with a BMI 20.0–22.4 kg/m2 displayed
an increased multivariable-adjusted
risk for DM mortality (HR 1.4 [95% CI
1.0–1.9]; P = 0.041) compared with the
17.5–19.9 kg/m2 reference group. Ado-
lescents with a BMI $30 kg/m2 had an
adjusted HR of 20.4 (95% CI 14.2–29.2;
P = 2.9 3 10260) for DM mortality. Figure
2B depicts the DM mortality function
during the study period. The findings
were undiminished when the analysis
was limited to those with unimpaired
health status during adolescence (Sup-
plementary Table 4B). A multivariable
spline model indicated a minimum risk
for DM mortality close to 18 kg/m2, with
significantly increased risk seen above
adolescent BMI values of 21.6 kg/m2
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
The prevalence of overweight and
obesity in our cohort has increased con-
sistently over the past four decades,
from 8.7% in the 1967–1977 period to
20.8% between 2012 and 2014, with an
increase of 0.45 kg/m2 per decade for
the entire cohort between 1980 and

BMI and Diabetes-Related Mortality
Diabetes Care Volume 39, November 2016
 2010, similar to the reported worldwide
trend (14,20). The PAF for DM mortality
attributable to overweight and obesity
(computed for those examined from
1967–1977 and for the 8.7% prevalence
of overweight and obesity) was 31.2%
(95% CI 26.6–36.1%), and the projected
PAF for the 20.8% prevalence of over-
weight and obesity in 2012–2014 was
52.1% (95% CI 46.4–57.4%).
CONCLUSIONS
In this nationwide, population-based
study we report the association be-
tween BMI in late adolescence and DM
mortality in midlife based on a follow-up
of over 42 million person-years, during
which 481 DM-related deaths occurred.
The key findings are extremely high HRs
for BMI in the overweight (HR = 8.0) and
obese (HR = 17.2) categories (with lower
95% CI bounds of 5.7 and 11.9, respec-
tively), and that BMI values that are cur-
rently considered in the midnormal
range were associated with increased
DM mortality, exhibiting a graded in-
crease from the 25th–49th percentiles
onward, with 4.1-fold higher hazard in
adolescents in the upper normal range
(75th–84th BMI percentiles), and an HR
of 2.7 for the 22.5–25.0 kg/m2 BMI cat-
egory. Findings from spline models sug-
gest that absolute adolescent BMI
values in the region of 18 and 20 kg/m2
are associated with the minimum risk for
DM and all-cause mortality. Global mor-
tality attributed to diabetes has in-
creased by 76% during the past two
decades and was ranked globally as the
ninth cause of death (2), with a forecast
of a further increase in most parts of the
world within the next decade (3). Not-
withstanding its importance, mortality
attributable to diabetes is underesti-
mated and inconsistently reported (21–23).
Among U.S. adults with a known history
of diabetes, less than 40% of the dece-
dents had diabetes listed anywhere on
their death certificate (24). While we
have no similar data for the Israeli pop-
ulation, the proportional DM mortality
in our cohort is comparable to that re-
ported elsewhere. For example, a recent
Swedish study that followed 1.3 million
male adolescents from age 18 over 3 de-
cades reported 508 DM-related deaths
among a total of 44,313 deaths (1.15%)
(25), which is comparable with 1.50% in
our cohort. Nevertheless, it is likely that
diabetes was the underlying determinant
of many deaths that were assigned to
other causes, such as coronary heart dis-
ease and ischemic stroke. In that respect,
we recently assessed the association be-
tween BMI at adolescence and cardiovas-
cular death, demonstrating that an
increased hazard is expected above the
50th BMI percentile and above an abso-
lute value of 20 kg/m2 (9).
Overall, the strength of the associa-
tion between BMI (at age 17) and all-
cause mortality in the present cohort is
similar to that of other cohorts. We re-
ported HRs of 1.88 (1.69–2.09) and 2.05
(1.55–3.01) for overweight and obese
male adolescents in this cohort, respec-
tively, when the full “normal” range
(5th–84th U.S. CDC BMI percentiles)
was used as the reference (15). Among
6,502 male Danish recruits whose BMI
was measured at age 17, obesity was
associated with an HR of 2.1 (95% CI
1.3–3.5) for death before age 55 (26).
Engeland et al. (27) reported HRs of
1.82 (95% CI 1.48–2.25) and 2.03 (95%
CI 1.51–2.72) for all-cause mortality
among obese male and female Nor-
wegian adolescents, respectively, who
were followed for approximately three
decades (n = 227,000).
A previous study that was based on a
selective subsample of 37,000 partici-
pants from our cohort assessed the as-
sociation between adolescent BMI
(classified in deciles) and the incidence
of type 2 diabetes with a follow-up from
age 17 until age 45 (9). When applying
the decile groupings used in that study,
we found among men age-adjusted HRs
of 1.7 (95% CI 1.0–2.9) for DM-related
death vs. 1.7 (95% CI 1.3–2.2) for DM
incidence for a BMI between 22.35 and
23.39 kg/m2 (decile 8), 2.8 (95% CI 1.7–
4.8) vs. 2.3 (95% CI 1.7–3.0) for a BMI
between 23.40 and 25.06 kg/m2 (decile
9), and 8.0 (95% CI 4.9–13.0) vs. 4.2 (95%
CI 3.2–5.4) for a BMI between 25.06 and
36.0 kg/m2 (decile 10) when using a BMI
of 15.0–18.11 kg/m2 (decile 1) as the ref-
erence group. The associations were
generally similar in magnitude, except
for the top decile.
Our data suggest that the contribu-
tion of elevated adolescent BMI to the
risk of DM mortality may be underesti-
mated in the literature. When the full
conventionally accepted normal percen-
tile range of BMI was used as a reference,
and when overweight and obesity were
grouped together (Supplementary Table
9), the resulting HR of 6.2 was similar to
that of a previous report of overweight
and obese female Norwegian adolescents
(HR = 5.7) (28). Thus classification of BMI
according to the accepted “normal” range
(5th–84th BMI percentiles) may under-
estimate the actual risk associated with
obesity, as the high-normal BMI range
(75th–84th percentiles) was associated
with a more than fourfold increase in
DM mortality.
Turning our attention to population
measures, a pooled global analysis (13)
estimated that the PAF for overweight
and obese adults accounted for approx-
imately 30% of worldwide DM-related
deaths in 2010, similar to our findings
for the prevalence of adolescent over-
weight/obesity preceding the childhood
obesity epidemic, and considerably less
than the projections for the prevalence
in 2012–2014. The participants included
in that analysis spanned a wide age
range (15–84 years), which may lead to
underestimation of the risk in the youn-
gest age group (29), with an assumption
of an optimal BMI distribution between
21 and 23 kg/m2 (13,30). Additionally,
misclassification as a result of the use
of recalled weight and height rather
than measured data is major source of
bias (31,32) because it typically results
in shifting the BMI distribution “to the
left” and would act to dilute the strength
of the association. Finally, our hazard es-
timates are for premature deaths from
DM occurring before age 64, which may
well differ from later deaths in the magni-
tude of the association.
The finding that BMI values associ-
ated with minimum risk for DM and all-
cause mortality reside in the low-normal
and underweight ranges is consistent
with a recent report of this cohort that
assessed cardiovascular mortality out-
comes (15). We suggest two potential
explanations for the associations of ado-
lescent BMI with DM mortality in mid-
life. The first is that BMI in adolescence,
particularly within the overweight and
obese ranges, is associated with in-
creased expression of deleterious risk
factors for DM at a young age (6). Sec-
ond, BMI “tracks” quite substantively
into adulthood (9,33,34), such that those
within the higher or lower BMI range as
adolescents are more likely to have
higher or lower values in adulthood.
Therefore it is possible that adult BMI
mediates and accentuates the effect of

 adolescent BMI. In the absence of adult
measures of BMI in our cohort, we were
unable to assess whether adolescent
BMI is risk factor for DM mortality, in-
dependent of adult BMI. However, a pre-
vious study, undertaken using a selective
subset of this cohort, indicated that the
association of adolescent obesity with
incident diabetes in midlife was not
independent of adult BMI in young
adulthood (9). Nevertheless, whether
adolescent BMI acts as a predictor of
adulthood obesity, is an independent
risk factor, or both, it is clearly a strong
risk marker for DM and all-cause mortal-
ity, independent of sociodemographic
and other health-related variables at
age 17. With regard to the strong asso-
ciations found in our study, we note that
early onset type 2 diabetes among obese
young adults seems to be a more ag-
gressive disease from a vascular stand-
point, leading to an increased risk of
complications (35). Moreover, obesity
per se is reported to increase the likeli-
hood of progression of diabetes compli-
cations by numerous mechanisms, such
as promoting endothelial dysfunction
and oxidative stress, increasing proa-
therogenic lipid particles, and increas-
ing coagulability (36).
There are several limitations to this
study. First, we lacked data on the in-
cidence of diabetes, precluding us from
examining whether the mortality asso-
ciation with BMI expresses incidence,
case fatality, or both. However, HRs for
the incidence of DM in a small subsam-
ple of our cohort (9) were not very dif-
ferent in the “normal” range of BMI
from DM mortality in a comparable re-
analysis we undertook, whereas above
BMIs of 25 kg/m2, the association with
DM mortality was accentuated. Second,
most diabetes-related deaths in our co-
hort were coded as “unspecified” type,
thereby precluding valid assessment of
associations by diabetes type. Never-
theless, stratification of DM mortality
by diabetes type (Supplementary Table
14), or exclusion of those with a diagno-
sis of diabetes in adolescence (Supple-
mentary Table 12), or excluding those
with any chronic illness (Supplementary
Table 3) left the association either un-
changed or even accentuated. Third, as
stated above, lack of data regarding BMI
in adulthood prevented us from exam-
ining the pathway by which adolescent
obesity might affect DM mortality and
assessing an independent association
with adolescent BMI (9). Fourth, data
regarding risk factors for diabetes,
including smoking, physical activity,
inflammation, glycemic control, and
medications used during follow-up,
were not routinely collected in this co-
hort. In particular, smoking may play a
role both as a risk factor for diabetes
(37) and as a determinant of increased
fatality among patients with diabetes
(38). Smoking was reported to be asso-
ciated with overweight and obesity in
overlapping subsamples of our cohort
(n = 29,745 and 25,935) that were inter-
viewed at ages 20–22 after completion
of their military service (39,40), and this
may have contributed to the high risk
estimates in the obese group. Fifth,
waist circumference, which reflects ab-
dominal adiposity and has been shown
to be associated with mortality even af-
ter accounting for BMI (41), was not
measured in our cohort. Finally, the
data presented here are from a young
cohort, which reflects only a fraction of
the overall diabetes mortality that will
manifest as this cohort ages, as evi-
denced by the young mean age at death
from DM. The strengths of the study in-
clude the nationwide representative
sample of the Jewish population, its fully
prospective design with standardized
measurement of BMI at baseline, and
the ability to evaluate associations
across the full BMI range with adequate
statistical power, given a very large sam-
ple size and a follow-up extending for
over four decades.
In conclusion, BMI in late adoles-
cence, including measures well within
the currently accepted normal range, is
strongly associated with diabetes mor-
tality in midlife, exceeding that of car-
diovascular mortality (15). The PAFs
point to its substantial population im-
pact and public health importance. The
increasing prevalence of overweight
and obesity, and of adolescents in the
mid- and high-normal range, are likely
to account for a large and increasing
proportion of DM incidence, its related
microvascular and macrovascular com-
plications, and DM mortality.
