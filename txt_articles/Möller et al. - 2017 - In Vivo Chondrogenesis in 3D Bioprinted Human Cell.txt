artilage is an avascular tissue that once degenerated 
or wounded has limited ability to heal. Current re-
constructive options for cartilage repair1 or replace-
ment2 are limited by numerous problems and the lack of 
suitable cartilage substitute poses a major challenge. The 
demand for cartilage tissue restoration is therefore high. 
Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology may rep-
resent a possible solution.
The bioprinting technology can generate 3D tissue 
through the precise deposition of cells and supporting 
structures simultaneously, in a layer-by-layer fashion.3–6 
In cartilage 3D printing, ink-jet printing7 and extru-
sion printing8 are the most commonly used techniques. 
Hydrogels represent the main material used as bio ink.9

Background: The three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology allows creation 
of 3D constructs in a layer-by-layer fashion utilizing biologically relevant materials 
such as biopolymers and cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of 3D 
bioprinting in a clinically relevant setting to evaluate the potential of this tech-
nique for in vivo chondrogenesis.
Methods: Thirty-six nude mice (Balb-C, female) received a 5- × 5- × 1-mm piece of 
bioprinted cell-laden nanofibrillated cellulose/alginate construct in a subcutane-
ous pocket. Four groups of printed constructs were used: (1) human (male) nasal 
chondrocytes (hNCs), (2) human (female) bone marrow–derived mesenchymal 
stem cells (hBMSCs), (3) coculture of hNCs and hBMSCs in a 20/80 ratio, and (4) 
Cell-free scaffolds (blank). After 14, 30, and 60 days, the scaffolds were harvested 
for histological, immunohistochemical, and mechanical analysis.
Results: The constructs had good mechanical properties and keep their structural 
integrity after 60 days of implantation. For both the hNC constructs and the cocul-
tured constructs, a gradual increase of glycosaminoglycan production and hNC 
proliferation was observed. However, the cocultured group showed a more pro-
nounced cell proliferation and enhanced deposition of human collagen II demon-
strated by immunohistochemical analysis.
Conclusions: In vivo chondrogenesis in a 3D bioprinted human cell-laden hydro-
gel construct has been demonstrated. The trophic role of the hBMSCs in stimu-
lating hNC proliferation and matrix deposition in the coculture group suggests 
the potential of 3D bioprinting of human cartilage for future application in re-
constructive surgery. (Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open 2017;5:e1227; doi: 10.1097/

based10 on natural polymers like collagen,11 hyaluronic 
acid12 chitosan,13 or alginate,14 and are used because of 
their high biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. Their 
high water content gives them a structural similarity to 
extracellular matrix (ECM) of cartilage.9,15 One of the 
shortcomings of hydrogels is their viscoelastic prop-
erties, which hamper good printing fidelity (fine line 
resolution). Another problem is their mechanical prop-
erties, such as strength and stiffness, which make them 
difficult to handle during transplantation. An additional 
requirement for an ideal bionic for in vivo use is long-
term structural stability. To compensate the inability of 
hydrogel to maintain a uniform 3D structure, a support-
ing polymer16 or combination with other materials such 
as gelatin17 can be used. We have recently showed that 
all these shortcomings can be overcome by formulat-
ing a bioink based on nanofibrillated cellulose and al-
ginate.18 Although substantial progress has been made, 
the lack of mechanical and structural integrity of the 
3D constructs still represents a major challenge. The in-
ability of the scaffold to keep its 3D shape and tolerate 
load-bearing has limited the application in vivo of the 3D 
printed tissues, such as cartilage. The recently developed 
a novel bioink has proved to be able to generate con-
structs with stable architecture and adequate mechanical 
properties. This new bionic combines the shear thinning 
properties of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) with the 
fast cross-linking ability of alginate. It can therefore be 
considered a promising hydrogel for 3D bioprinting with 
living cells for growth of cartilage tissue.18 Attempts to 
generate cartilage structures have been largely based on 
chondrocytes19 and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) used 
individually.20 However, the combination of both cell 
sources in mixed cell cultures has been demonstrated to 
enhance chondrogenesis.21,22 In this study, we aimed to 
investigate the use of 3D bioprinting in a clinically rel-
evant setting to evaluate the potential of this technique 
for in vivo chondrogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Types and Cell Culture
Human bone marrow–derived stem cells (hBMSCs) 
originally derived from a female donor (Rooster Bio, 
MD) and human nasal chondrocytes (hNCs) originated 
from a male donor undergoing septum rhinoplasty at the 
Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Ulm, University 
Medical Centre (ULM, Germany, Ethical permission no. 
152/08) were used. The hBMSCs were cultured under 
standard culture conditions (37°C, 5% CO2, humidified) 
using an hBM-MSC High Performance Media Kit (Roost-
er Bio). The hBMSCs were passaged once after 4 days in 
culture and harvested for printing on day 8. The hNCs 
were cultured for 6 days in DMEM/F-12 medium (Life 
Technologies, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum (HyClone, GE Healthcare, South Lo-
gan, UT) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (HyClone, GE 
Healthcare) without additional passages, and then har-
vested for printing.
3D Bioprinting of Gridded Structures
A nanofibrillated cellulose/alginate (NFC-A) bioink 
(CELLINK AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) was used for print-
ing lattice-shaped constructs using a pneumatic extrusion 
bioprinter INKREDIBLE (CELLINK AB) mounted in a LAF 
bench. For homogenous mix of the cells with the NFC-A bio-
ink in a ratio of 1:11, a cell mixer was used (CELLINK AB).
The initial cell density for all groups was 10 × 106 cells/
ml bioink. After printing, the lattice structured grids were 
cross-linked with 100 mM CaCl2 solution for 5 minutes at 
37°C. Thereafter, cell-free structures were washed with 
Hanks balanced salt solution (HyClone, GE Healthcare) 
supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2, whereas cell-laden con-
structs were washed with their respective cell culture me-
dium at 37°C. Printed constructs were implanted into nude 
mice within 1 hour after printing. For day 0, cell-laden 
constructs were simulated by mixing DMEM/F-12 medium 
(Life Technologies), instead of cell suspension, with the bio-
ink. Mixing ratio was the same as for cell-laden constructs.
Subcutaneous Implantation of Scaffolds in Mice and 
Experimental Groups
To evaluate neocartilage formation and the stability of 
the bioprinted constructs in vivo, cell-laden and cell-free 
constructs were implanted subcutaneously on the back 
of 6-week-old nude female mice (Balb-C, 9 animals per 
group). Wounds were sutured with 6.0 Vicryl Rapid (Eth-
icon, Sommerville, NJ) and covered with a sterile wound 
tape. The animal experiments were approved by the Ethical 
committee for experimental animals, University of Gothen-
burg (No. 119-2015). Four different experimental groups 
were implanted: (1) cell-free scaffolds; (2) scaffolds with 
hNCs; (3) scaffolds with hBMSCs; and (4) scaffolds with a 
coculture of hNCs and hBMSCs (20%/80%). Mice were 
anesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of Ketamin 
(50 mg/ml) and Dormitor (1 mg/ml), mixed in a 1:1 ratio. 
The injection dose was 0.05 ml per 20 g animal weight.
Over the implantation period, the overall behavior and 
wound healing were assessed by visual inspection. After 14, 
30, and 60 days, 3 animals per group were terminated and the 
construct was explanted. From each construct, one-third was 
used for mechanical analysis and the other two-thirds were 
used for histological and immunohistochemical analyses.
Histological Analysis
To qualitatively evaluate the formation of neocartilage, 
the constructs were harvested after 14, 30, and 60 days of 
subcutaneous implantation.
Explants were fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde sup-
plemented with 20 mM CaCl2 overnight at 4°C, processed 
for paraffin embedding, and sectioned (5 μm).
To assess glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) present in the 
newly synthesized ECM, deparaffinized sections were 
stained with Alcian Blue and van Gieson.
Immunohistochemical Analysis
Before antigen retrieval with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) 
at 70°C, sections were deparaffinized. Sections were digest-
ed with hyaluronidase, 8.000 units/ml (Sigma–Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MO) in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for

Möller et al. • 3D Bioprinted Hydrogel Constructs
60 minutes at 37°C, followed by incubation with 10% goat 
serum (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) in 0.1 M PBS for 15 
minutes to block nonspecific binding sites. Afterwards, sec-
tions were treated with monoclonal mouse anti-human type 
II collagen (Clone II-4CII; MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) 
for 1 hour at a 1/150 dilution. Before staining with second-
ary goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 546 
(A11030; ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA), the sections were 
once again blocked with 10% goat serum in 0.1 M PBS for 
15 minutes. After incubation for 1 hour with secondary an-
tibody (1/300 dilution), the sections were washed in PBS. 
Mounting solution (ProLongGold antifade Mountant with 
DAPI; Thermo Fischer) was applied and the sections were 
stored overnight at 4°C. Positive staining for human type 
II collagen was confirmed with the use of native human 
knee cartilage. A monoclonal mouse IgG antibody (Mouse 
IgG1 K Isotype Control Purified; eBioscience, Thermo 
Fischer) was used as a negative control in a 1/75 dilution. 
Stained sections were analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse 90i 
epi-fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-Fi2 
color camera head, a DS-U3 camera controller, and a NIS-
Elements imaging software suite (Version D 4.10.02; Nikon 
Instruments Inc, Melville, NY).
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
To determine whether the chondrocytes or the MSCs 
deposited GAG, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
for human chromosomes X and Y was used. In short, sec-
tions were deparaffinized, dehydrated in EtOH series, and 
pretreated with sodium thiocyanate at 80°C for 30 min-
utes and RO-H2O for 3 minutes. After a further protease 
treatment at 37°C for 45 minutes, samples were again 
dehydrated in EtOH series, probed with Vysis CEP X/Y 
(Cat # 07J22-050, Abbot Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), 
denatured at 85°C for 5 minutes, and hybridized overnight 
at 37°C. Stained sections were washed post-hybridization 
with SSC/0.05% Tween before counterstaining with DAPI.
Biomechanical Analysis
Mechanical properties of explants and nonimplanted 
scaffolds were assessed with a universal testing machine 
(Instron Model 5565A, Norwood, MA) equipped with a 
100-N load cell, and a cylindrical plane-ended stainless 
steel indenter (Ø 12 mm). Unconfined compression tests 
were performed in wet conditions in Hanks balanced salt 
solution (HyClone, GE Healthcare) at room temperature. 
Initial dimensions of the samples were measured with a 
digital caliper and high-quality image analysis using the 
imaging software ImageJ. With increments of 10%/s, sam-
ples were compressed until 40% compressive strain. Maxi-
mum compressive stress at 40% strain was calculated for 
all samples, using a Bluehill software (Instron).
RESULTS
3D Bioprinting of Cell-laden Constructs
The CAD file used to control the 3D bioprinting of the 
constructs resulted in a good architecture of lattice-shaped 
constructs, suitable to provide oxygen and nutrient dif-
fusion into the cell-laden hydrogel bioink. Cross-linking 
with CaCl2 yielded good mechanical properties of the 
nanofibrillated cellulose/alginate scaffolds.
Mechanical Properties of Constructs In Vivo
All constructs showed good handling properties. Cell-
laden and cell-free implants were integrated in subcutane-
ous tissue already after 14 days (Fig. 1). We observed an 
improved stiffness of the printed constructs after 60 days 
in vivo. All constructs remained in good shape and with 
preserved mechanical properties.
Neocartilage Formation In Vivo
Neocartilage formation of cell-laden NFC-A constructs 
was evaluated after 14, 30, and 60 days of subcutaneous im-
plantation in nude mice. FISH and histopathological tests 
demonstrated human cartilage formation in the construct. 
GAG synthesis was examined using Alcian Blue and van Gie-
son staining. No positive staining was found in the cell-free 
scaffolds and the hBMSC samples. A gradual increase in 
GAG deposition was observed in both the hNC group and 
the coculture group, and appeared more pronounced in the 
hNC/hBMSC group (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemistry for hu-
man type II collagen confirmed the deposition of chondro-
genic ECM after 60 days of implantation (Fig. 3). FISH for 
human chromosomes X and Y showed that only human na-
soseptal chondrocytes had proliferated, formed cell clusters, 
and synthesized GAGs and type II collagen (Fig. 4). After 60 
days, the formed tissue showed all the qualitative features 
of proper cartilage and the formation of chondrocyte cell 
clusters was a clear evidence of proliferation. The cells in the 
cell clusters contained both human chromosomes X and Y, 
showing that cells were of human origin.

Biomechanical Analysis
Mechanical testing was performed to determine the in-
fluence of chondrogenesis on the stiffening of the implanted 
constructs. The implanted lattice-shaped structures became 
more stable over the duration of the experiment (Table 1). 
Cell-laden constructs performed better than cell-free ones.
DISCUSSION
The clinical relevance of this study consists of the evi-
dence of new human cartilage formation in a 3D bioprint-
ed construct using a coculture of human cells. FISH and 
histopathological analysis demonstrated the trophic role 
of MSCs on chondrocyte proliferation and matrix deposi-

tion. The bioink used showed good mechanical properties 
and resulted a suitable environment for cell proliferation.
This study shows that the combination of nanofibrillat-
ed cellulose/alginate hydrogel, hNCs, and hBMSCs for 3D 
bioprinting resulted in high-fidelity constructs with good 
mechanical properties and a gradual increase of GAG de-
position, resembling cartilage formation in vivo. As the 
lattice-shaped constructs were printed with space between 
the lines, nutrients and oxygen could diffuse through and 
reach the cells in the hydrogel. Such an oxygen and nu-
trient supply is necessary for the embedded cells to sur-
vive, proliferate, and deposit GAG. As observed for the 
human nasoseptal chondrocyte group and the coculture 
group, GAGs were formed gradually over the duration of 
the study. At 60 days post-implantation, a strong Alcian 
Blue stain surrounded the cells and showed the formation 
of GAG in the newly synthesized ECM. The presence of 
human type II collagen was confirmed by immunohisto-
chemistry. Deposition of cartilaginous ECM appeared to 
be more pronounced when using a coculture of hNCs 
and hBMSCs, rather than a single cell type alone (Fig. 2). 
We used the specific 20/80 ratio as it is well established 
to be an optimal ratio for induction of cartilage regen-
eration.22–27 The improved performance of the coculture 
can be attributed to a trophic role of MSCs in stimulating 
chondrocyte proliferation and matrix deposition. Such a 
beneficial role of MSCs as mediators in cartilage forma-
tion is in line with other reports demonstrating the role 
of trophic effects of MSCs, mediated by secreted factors 
and direct cell–cell contact.23–27 It has been reported that 
MSCs secrete various cytokines and growth factors, which 
restore functions of injured tissue in vivo and enhance cell 
viability and proliferation in vitro.28,29 A predominantly 
trophic role of the MSCs is also supported by the hBMSC 
group not showing any cartilaginous ECM production. It 
was observed that hBMSCs in the coculture group and in 
the hBMSC group disappeared over time. This could be 
due to apoptosis, which has been reported for cultured 
stem cells.23 In coculture, apoptosis inducing cytokines, 
secreted by the chondrocytes, may have contributed to 
MSC death.30 This disappearance of MSCs further points 
toward MSC-secreted factors being the main reason for a 
better performance of the coculture. Results from FISH 
support this trophic role of MSCs as well, rather than a 
chondrogenic differentiation of the MSCs (Fig. 4). The 
trophic effects of hMSCs have already been utilized in 
clinical or preclinical applications, for example, in the 
treatment of large-size cartilage defects or osteoarthri-
tis.31–33 Not only can the use of MSCs be advantageous 
with regard to enhancing chondrogenesis, it can also re-
duce the number of chondrocytes needed for treatment. 
As chondrocytes are a rather sparse cell type, replacing 
the majority of them with MSCs abundantly available in 
a human body (eg, in adipose tissue and bone marrow) 
poses a significant benefit for clinical applications. More-
over, there is no ultimate need for in vitro expansion of 
MSCs before application and in contrast to chondrocytes 
this cell type does not show dedifferentiation during in 
vitro cell culture.23–25 Deposition of chondrogenic ECM is 
also reflected in the biomechanical analyses. In general, 
unconfined compression analysis showed an increase in 
compressive stress for cell-laden samples over the period 
of this pilot study. For the hNC group and the coculture 
group, this increase correlates with the formation and de-
position of GAG and human type II collagen. However, 
the strong increase in maximum compressive stress for 
the hBMSC group at 60 days post-implantation cannot be 
attributed to GAG or type II collagen formation, as analy-
sis of stained histological sections showed that there were 
no cells left in the bioprinted construct (data not shown). 
Therefore, we conclude that residual host tissue has af-
fected the measurement.
This pilot study has certain limitations. First of all, 
cell density plays an important role in tissue engineering 
of cartilage. Puelacher et al34 reported that the cell den-
sity should preferably be greater than 20 × 106 cells/ml, 
whereas at low cell densities cartilage formation would 
be decreased. During embryogenesis of cartilage, prolif-
erative MSCs responsible for the formation of cartilage 
ECM are densely packed. For tissue engineering of car-

tilage, this early stage of tissue development should be 
simulated to generate functional and stable cartilage. 
Furthermore, a high cell density would allow for in-
creased cell–cell contact, preventing a dedifferentiation 
of cells and enhance proliferation and chondrogenic 
ECM deposition.
Secondly, the samples measured for the unconfined 
compression analysis were only about one third in size 
of the initial construct (5 × 5 × 1 mm). Hence, difficulties 
in area determination of the measured constructs have 
to be taken into account. As the length and height are 
very important input factors for the determination of the 
compressive stress, a considerable error from the mea-
surement with a simple digital caliper and the use of the 
imaging software ImageJ for length measurement can be 
suspected.
Moreover, we have not been able to correlate the me-
chanical properties of the neocartilage of this study with 
native human cartilage. However, variation of ethnicity, 
gender, and age has not allowed the precise determina-
tion of the mechanical properties of human nasal carti-
lage of the septum.35–37
The mechanical properties of bioengineered cartilage 
are determined by deposition of GAG and collagen and 
by the cell type used.38 Moreover, there may still have been 
host tissue surrounding the samples for biomechanical 
analysis. This residual tissue could thus have affected the 
outcome, especially with regard to the hBMSC group. Not-
withstanding the stated limitations, our findings support 
that the bioink based on nanofibrillated cellulose mixed 
with alginate provides a suitable environment for NCs and 
MSCs to synthesize neocartilage in 3D bioprinted con-
structs in vivo. Another important finding is that the ma-
terial shows excellent structural integrity and good host 
tissue integration in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS
In this in vivo study, we demonstrated that 3D bioprint-
ing technology with human cell-laden hydrogels can result 
in cartilage synthesis in constructs with high fidelity and 
good mechanical properties. This study reveals clinical 
relevance and suggests the potential of 3D bioprinting of 
human cartilage for future application in reconstructive 
surgery.
