ABSTRACT
Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-borne arbovirus presenting
a public health threat in North America. POWV lineage II, also known as deer tick vi-
rus, is the strain of the virus most frequently found in Ixodes scapularis ticks and is
implicated in most cases of POWV encephalitis in the United States. Currently, no
commercial tests are available to detect POWV exposure in tick-borne disease (TBD)
patients. We describe here the development and analytical validation of a serologic
test panel to detect POWV infections. The panel uses an indirect enzyme immunoas-
say (EIA) to screen. EIA-positive samples reflex to a laboratory-developed, POWV-
specific immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The analytical sensitivity of the test panel
was 89%, and the limit of detection was a plaque reduction neutralization test
(PRNT) titer of 1:20. The analytical specificity was 100% for the IgM assay and 65%
for the IgG assay when heterologous-flavivirus-positive samples were tested. On
samples collected from regions where Lyme disease is endemic, seroprevalence for
POWV in TBD samples was 9.4% (10 of 106) versus 2% when tested with non-TBD
samples (2 of 100, P � 0.034). No evidence of POWV infection was seen in samples
collected from a region where Lyme disease was not endemic (0 of 22). This test
panel provides a sensitive and specific platform for detecting a serologic response to
POWV early in the course of infection when neutralizing antibodies may not be de-
tectable. Combined with clinical history, the panel is an effective tool for identifying
acute POWV infection.
IMPORTANCE Approximately 100 cases of POWV disease were reported in the United
States over the past 10 years. Most cases have occurred in the Northeast (52) and
Great Lakes (45) regions (https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/statistics.html). The preva-
lence of POWV in ticks and mammals is increasing, and POWV poses an increasing
threat in a greater geographical range. In areas of the Northeast and Midwest where
Lyme disease is endemic, POWV testing is recommended for patients with a recent tick
bite, patients with Lyme disease who have been treated with antibiotics, or patients
with a tick exposure who have tested negative for Lyme disease or other tick-borne
illnesses and have persistent symptoms consistent with posttreatment Lyme disease.
Testing could also benefit patients with tick exposure and unexplained neurologic
symptoms and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients with known tick exposure. Until
now, diagnostic testing for Powassan virus has not been commercially available and has
been limited to patients presenting with severe, neurologic complications. The lack of
routine testing for Powassan virus in patients with suspected tick-borne disease means
that little information is available regarding the overall prevalence of the virus and the

 full spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with infection. As Ixodes scapularis is the
tick vector for Powassan virus and multiple other tick-borne pathogens, including the
Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, the clinical presentations and long-term
outcomes of Powassan virus infection and concurrent infection with other tick-borne
disease pathogens remain unknown.
KEYWORDS Powassan virus, deer tick virus, enzyme immunoassay, flavivirus,

P
owassan virus (POWV) is the only North American member of the tick-borne
encephalitis complex (TBE-C) of viruses, which are transmitted by the bite of an
infected tick. Other members of the TBE-C include the following flaviviruses: tick-borne
encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Eastern Europe and Western Asia, Omsk hemorrhagic fever
virus in Siberia, Kyasanur Forest disease virus in India, Alkhurma virus in Saudi Arabia,
and Louping ill virus in the United Kingdom. TBE-C viruses can cause a wide range of
disease in humans, from mild febrile illness with biphasic fever to encephalitis or
hemorrhagic fever (1). POWV is composed of two genetically and ecologically distinct
lineages (2). Prototype POWV (lineage I) is transmitted primarily by Ixodes cookei, a tick
with a narrow vertebrate host range that rarely feeds on humans. Powassan virus
lineage II, also known as deer tick virus (DTV), is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, a tick
with a broad host range that also transmits the infectious agents that cause Lyme
disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis (3). Since the late 1990s, POWV
infections have been reported in the Northeastern and Midwestern parts of the United
States as well as in Canada, and incidence is increasing (4). Because the territory of
I. scapularis is expanding and the prevalence of POWV in ticks and mammals is
increasing, POWV poses an increasing threat (5, 6). In a recent survey, I. scapularis ticks
collected from the northwest quadrant of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2012 demonstrated
a POWV infection frequency of 4.67% (7). This is similar in frequency to a survey
conducted in that same area in 1998 (8). Although POWV is rarely diagnosed as a cause
of encephalitis, infections can be severe, and neurologic sequelae are common (9).
Additionally, the potential for concurrent transmission with other tick-borne patho-
gens, particularly Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has not been
previously studied in North America.
Similarly to other arboviral infections, POWV diagnosis is complex, requiring review
of clinical and travel history in addition to knowledge of and access to diagnostic
testing (10). Serologic testing remains the primary method for diagnosis of POWV
infection, with an emphasis on the detection of POWV-specific IgM antibodies in serum
or plasma. Until recently, commercial laboratory testing has been unavailable for POWV
in the United States. Prior to this, a positive POWV IgM enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
result confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), a 4-fold or greater
increase in titers between acute- and convalescent-phase sera, or culture or direct
identification of virus-specific nucleic acids at a state public health laboratory or the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (11) has been the mainstay of
diagnostic testing.
We describe here a laboratory-developed, serologic test panel, commercially avail-
able at a reference laboratory, for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to POWV in
serum and plasma samples. The first test in the panel is a highly sensitive, commercial
TBE-C screen by EIA. Per the manufacturer, cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses is
expected, particularly with West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV) antibody-
positive samples. Samples that are screen positive are then confirmed for POWV by
indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Performance characteristics of the test panel
were optimized, and validation studies were performed to assess the analytical sensi-
tivity, reproducibility, and specificity/cross-reactivity of the serologic test panel for use
in routine diagnostic testing.

 RESULTS
Assay optimization and analytical sensitivity. No difference in sensitivity was
observed between the viral strains tested or between lots of slides. A sample dilution
of 1:20 for IgM and 1:40 for POWV IgG IFAs demonstrated the optimal balance between
sensitivity and nonspecific background staining (Fig. 1). Tick-borne disease (TBD)
samples with titers of 1:320 and 1:160 in the plaque reduction neutralization test using
a 90% reduction cutoff (PRNT90) were assayed at optimized screening dilutions to
confirm. All but one of the POWV encephalitis samples obtained from the New York
State Department of Health (NYSDOH) with PRNT90 titers of 1:20 were detected by the
TBE-C EIA screen and confirmatory POWV IFA. A PRNT90 titer of 1:20 was determined to
be the limit of detection (LOD) for the serologic test panel and was confirmed as such
using known PRNT90-positive samples (Table 1). At these screening dilutions, the
serologic panel showed an analytical sensitivity of 89% (Table 1). Reproducibility
studies showed 100% accordance (k � 1.0).
Analytical specificity. Due to limited sample volume availability for the hetero-
logous-flavivirus (HF) sample set, only yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccinee samples could
be analyzed in replicate runs at two different dilutions to check IFA specificity. A sample
known to be positive for YFV IgG antibodies (vaccinee 3) had a positive POWV IgG IFA
result at a 1:20 dilution but was negative at a 1:40 dilution. A sample known to be
positive for YFV IgM antibodies (vaccinee 1) had a positive POWV IgM IFA result at a
1:10 dilution but was negative at a 1:20 dilution (Fig. 2). Both of these samples were
negative when tested at the optimized screening dilutions used for the panel. Only one
recent YFV vaccine sample demonstrated cross-reactivity in the POWV IgG IFAs (Ta-
ble 2) when assayed at optimal screening dilutions.
The HF samples demonstrated significant cross-reactivity in the TBE-C IgG EIA, but
at a 1:40 dilution, the POWV IgG IFA specificity for non-TBE-C HF samples was 65%
(Table 2). This is comparable to other commercial IFAs. Fewer HF samples demonstrated

 cross-reactivity in the TBE-C IgM EIA than in the TBE-C IgG EIA, and no cross-reactivity
was seen in the POWV IgM IFA with any of the HF samples run at screening dilutions
(Table 3).
Clinical testing. Twenty-two (20%) of the TBD samples had TBE-C optical density
(OD) ratios above baseline and were tested in the POWV confirmatory IFA. One-half of
these samples (n � 11, Table 4) were IFA positive for antibodies to POWV. Two of the
three POWV IgG IFA-positive samples were PRNT90 positive (samples 13 and 19). The
third sample (sample 12) was negative in the PRNT90 and West Nile virus (WNV) IgG
positive, demonstrating evidence of cross-reactivity in the POWV IgG IFA. All eight
samples that were positive only in the POWV IgM IFA were negative in the PRNT. POWV
nucleic acid was detectable by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) in one sample
(sample 16 in Table 4). POWV seroprevalence for the TBD sample set was determined
to be 9.4% (10 of 106).
Of the 100 non-TBD samples from areas where Lyme disease is endemic, 23% (n �
23) had TBE-C EIA OD ratios higher than baseline and were tested by POWV IFA. Six of
the 23 EIA-positive samples were IFA positive for antibodies to POWV (Table 5), with

 four samples being IgG IFA positive and two samples IFA positive for IgG and IgM.
Three of the four IgG IFA-positive samples were positive for WNV IgG, again demon-
strating cross-reactivity of the IgG with WNV. The fourth sample was negative by
PRNT90. POWV seroprevalence for the non-TBD sample set was determined to be 2% (2
of 100). Patients with suspected TBD, who were tested for Lyme disease, are signifi-
cantly (P � 0.034) more likely to have evidence of POWV infection than asymptomatic
patients from an area where Lyme disease is endemic but who did not have a history
of recent tick exposure.
Six of the 22 control samples from an area in which Lyme disease was not
endemic had TBE-C EIA OD ratios above the cutoff in the IgM assay, but none were
positive in the POWV IFAs (0 of 22). None of these samples were above the cutoff
in the TBE-C IgG EIA.
DISCUSSION
Studies confirm that serologic cross-reactions among the flaviviruses are significant
and more frequently observed with IgG antibody detection assays. Both commercial
EIAs and IgG IFAs demonstrate poor specificity overall, with IFA being slightly better
than EIA. The overall specificity of flavivirus IgG EIAs is reported between 16 and 38%
and improves slightly to 29 to 84% for IgG IFAs (12). The addition of the POWV IgG IFA
to the TBE-C EIA screen eliminated 35% of the cross-reactivity seen with the EIA alone.
The immunological maturation of the IgG antibody response tends to foster the
formation of antibodies directed to epitopes with greater likelihood for cross-reactivity
(13). While the specificity of flavivirus PRNTs detecting neutralizing IgG antibodies is
high, this often comes at the cost of assay sensitivity. A PRNT50 tends to be more
sensitive in detecting early antibody responses, given the less stringent endpoint of

 �50% reduction in plaques, versus the highly specific �90% plaque reduction de-
scribed here (14). Also, low correlation between PRNT and IFA titer is not surprising
since the IFA detects antibodies to a variety of structural and nonstructural viral
proteins, whereas the PRNT primarily detects neutralizing antibodies directed to the
envelope (E) protein of the virus (13). When tested against non-tick-borne flavivirus
samples, the POWV IgG IFA described here demonstrated an analytical specificity of
65%, comparable to that of other commercial flavivirus IgG IFAs (15).

 30% higher than IgM EIA when patients with suspected flavivirus infections were
screened for several different viruses (12). The addition of the POWV IgM IFA to the
TBE-C EIA screen eliminated 55% of the cross-reactivity seen with the IgM EIA alone.
Many commercially available flavivirus IgM-specific serologic tests report sensitivity
lower than that seen with IgG assays, due primarily to the fact that PRNT is considered
the gold standard for the differential serodiagnosis. Published reports confirm that, in
patients with primary flavivirus infection, the IgM response likely consists of antibodies
with minimal to no virus-neutralizing capacity (16, 17). In a study assessing the
performance of a commercially available WNV IgM EIA, 14 of 44 CDC IgM protocol-
negative samples were found positive. The apparent lack of IgM specificity observed
with that assay may be attributed to the use of PRNT to confirm IgM positives as part
of the CDC protocol (18). In studies where convalescent-phase samples can be collected
from patients 2 to 4 weeks after infection, the use of PRNT may be helpful to confirm
the accuracy of acute-phase detection of IgM. In the studies presented here, we were
limited by design to samples collected only at the time of clinical presentation, and
therefore, follow-up convalescent-phase samples were not available. The lack of a
reliable and accurate predicate assay for use as a gold standard when developing
flavivirus IgM assays requires further study.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a single IgM-positive result for
arboviral diagnosis is considered a presumptive positive and should be confirmed by
RT-PCR, virus isolation, and/or PRNT to discriminate potentially cross-reactive antibod-
ies (19). In the current study, one POWV IgM IFA-positive sample was confirmed positive
by POWV RT-PCR with the remaining IgM IFA-positive samples lacking detectable viral
genome. Studies performed with WNV-positive patients show that viremia can be
detected for an average of 7 days and that IgM antibody becomes detectable a median
of 4 days after the midpoint of the interval for RNA detection, for an overlap of only 1
to 2 days (20). Therefore, RT-PCR cannot function as a sensitive confirmatory assay for
IgM-positive samples across all time points.

of virus-specific RNA. Only a few state health labs and the CDC offer this testing, and
the labor-intensive nature of the confirmatory tests often delays the reporting of final
results beyond the period of clinical utility. In addition, testing is usually limited to
patients presenting with neurologic complications; therefore, little is known regarding
the overall prevalence of and clinical symptoms associated with POWV infection.
Limited data regarding cocirculation of Lyme disease and POWV seroprevalence in the
Midwest have been published (21). The test panel described here allows for the simple
and efficient detection of acute POWV infection. However, due to the cross-reactivity
seen for all flavivirus IgG assays, it is imperative that exposure to other flaviviruses and
travel and vaccination history be considered when interpreting IgG test results. This
panel is a diagnostic tool that can play an important role in further defining the full
spectrum of POWV disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples for assay development. (i) Serum samples submitted for arbovirus encephalitis panel
testing. Optimization and analytical sensitivity studies were performed using POWV antibody-positive
serum samples confirmed by PRNT using a 90% reduction cutoff (PRNT90) (22). These samples had been
submitted to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Arbovirus Laboratory (n � 9) for
testing against an arbovirus encephalitis panel.
(ii) Heterologous-flavivirus sample set. The heterologous-flavivirus (HF) sample set consists of 11
human serum/plasma samples known to be IgM antibody positive and 12 samples known to be IgG
antibody positive to heterologous flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV)
(SeraCare’
s bank of disease state biological materials; Milford, MA) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV),
yellow fever virus (YFV), and TBEV (Euroimmun US). Another seven samples collected from YFV strain 17D
vaccine recipients at various time points postvaccination were included in the HF sample set.
Clinical samples to assess seroprevalence. (i) TBD sample set. The tick-borne disease sample set
consists of 106 serum/plasma samples submitted for Lyme disease testing from patients residing in
Wisconsin, an area in which Lyme disease is endemic (23). Patients were considered to have suspected
TBD if a Lyme disease serology test was ordered by their provider. Eleven serum samples were submitted
to Coppe Laboratories for routine Lyme disease testing, deidentified, and included in this study.
Ninety-five serum/plasma samples provided by the Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation (MCRF) were
residual diagnostic samples which had been submitted to Marshfield Clinic for Lyme disease testing. The
95 samples from MCRF were part of an institutional review board (IRB)-approved research protocol.
(ii) Non-TBD sample set. The non-TBD sample set collected from areas in which Lyme disease is
endemic consists of 100 serum/plasma samples collected from patients without symptoms of TBD and
without history or evidence of recent tick exposure. Fifty heparinized whole-blood samples from healthy,
asymptomatic adults were purchased from Analytical Biological Services (ABS), Inc. (Wilmington, DE), and
processed in-house to plasma. These samples were collected locally for biospecimen banking, in the
northeastern region of the United States, where Lyme disease is endemic (23). Fifty plasma samples were
collected by the Marshfield Clinic from residual diagnostic samples submitted for routine cholesterol or
complete metabolic panel screening. These samples were collected from subjects living in the same
geographic area as the TBD subjects and were part of the same IRB-approved protocol.
(iii) Control sample set. The control sample set from a region where Lyme disease is not endemic
consists of 22 samples collected from patients residing near Reno, NV. These samples, submitted to
Coppe Laboratories for human herpesvirus testing, were deidentified and included in the study.
Test methods. (i) TBE-C EIA method. Samples were screened for the presence of IgG and IgM
antibodies to TBE-C using anti-TBEV ELISA IgG (Euroimmun catalog no. EI-2661-9601G) and anti-TBEV
ELISA IgM (Euroimmun catalog no. EI-2661-9601M) per the manufacturer’
s recommended assay protocol.
These assays employ inactivated TBEV antigens of strain K23. Optical density (OD) ratio values were
calculated for each sample in reference to a calibrator provided with the test kit. Any samples with an
OD ratio that exceeded the baseline value were reflexed to confirmatory POWV IFA.
(ii) IFA method. An in-house strain of Powassan virus lineage II, sequence-confirmed deer tick virus
(DTV) isolated from an I. scapularis tick pool, along with viral reference strains Powassan LB and DTV
CT390 (World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Galveston, TX), was cultured in
Vero cells and used to prepare IFA substrate slides. Three different culture techniques were tested to
determine the best slide manufacturing conditions. Vero cells infected with POWV were grown on
eight-well chamber slides using optimized culture conditions. Slides were fixed in 2% neutral buffered
formalin (NBF) followed by 100% cold methanol and stored at �20°
C until use. Prior to testing, substrate
slides were warmed for 30 min in a humidity chamber at room temperature and blocked with 2% normal
goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for an additional 30 min. Patient serum and/or plasma
samples, positive and negative controls, were diluted 1:40 in 2% normal goat serum for IgG analysis and
1:20 in Eurosorb (Euroimmun US) anti-human IgG antibody buffer for IgM analysis, added to slide wells,

 and incubated for 60 min at 37°
C. After 1 h of incubation, the slides were washed 3 times with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 50 �l of DyLight 488 anti-human IgG (Vector Laboratories) diluted
1:300 or 50 �l of fluorescein anti-human IgM (mu-specific) secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories)
diluted 1:200 was added to each well. The slides were incubated for 30 min and washed three times in
PBS. The slides were counterstained with Evans blue, rinsed with distilled water, mounted using
Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and examined using an epifluorescence micro-
scope. Positive- and negative-control samples were included in all IFA runs.
(iii) Optimization of IFA. Titrations of fluorochrome-conjugated anti-human secondary antibodies
were performed to determine the optimal concentration for the assay. Sample titration experiments were
performed to determine optimal screening dilutions for IFAs that yield acceptable sensitivity while
minimizing cross-reaction with the heterologous-flavivirus (HF) sample set. Low-PRNT90-titer samples
were analyzed in duplicate assays at optimal screening dilutions to determine the lower limit of detection
(LOD) for the IFA. Reproducibility was assessed by testing 26 samples (17 positive samples and 9 negative
samples) in duplicate assays.
(iv) WNV method. Samples were tested for the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies to WNV by
qualitative EIA (Euroimmun US), and results were analyzed per the manufacturer’
s recommended
protocol.
(v) Clinical testing. All 106 TBD samples were tested for TBE-C by EIA. Any samples with TBE-C OD
ratios above baseline were tested with the optimized POWV IFA and WNV EIA. POWV IFA-positive
samples were submitted to NYSDOH for PRNT. A PRNT90 rather than a PRNT50 was used to ensure
specificity, though the expected sensitivity is lower (22).
All 100 non-TBD samples were tested for TBE-C and WNV by EIA. Samples with higher-than-baseline
TBE-C OD ratios were tested with the optimized POWV IFA. The two Marshfield Clinic samples that were
POWV IFA positive were also tested by PRNT90.
The 22 control samples were tested for TBE-C by EIA, and any samples with above-baseline OD ratios
reflexed to confirmatory IFA.
(vi) Statistical analysis. Analytical sensitivity was calculated as (true positives)/(true positives � false
negatives) � 100. Analytical sensitivity was determined using the arbovirus encephalitis panel. Analytical
specificity was calculated as (true negatives)/(true negatives � false positives) � 100. The limit of
detection was calculated as the lowest PRNT90 titer detected in the POWV IgG assay. Analytical specificity
was determined using the HF sample set. Seroprevalence was calculated for each of the TBD, non-TBD,
and control sample sets. Due to the inability of PRNT90 to be used for confirmation of POWV IgM and the
lack of cross-reactivity seen with the HF samples, samples that were POWV IgM IFA positive or POWV IgG
positive and confirmed by PRNT90 were presumed to be true positives. For samples that were negative
for POWV IgM by IFA, POWV IgG was considered a false positive if WNV IgG EIA was positive or PRNT90
was negative.
