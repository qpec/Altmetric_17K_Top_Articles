After psychological trauma, recurrent intrusive visual memories may be distressing and disruptive. Preventive interventions post
trauma are lacking. Here we test a behavioural intervention after real-life trauma derived from cognitive neuroscience. We
hypothesized that intrusive memories would be significantly reduced in number by an intervention involving a computer game
with high visuospatial demands (Tetris), via disrupting consolidation of sensory elements of trauma memory. The Tetris-based
intervention (trauma memory reminder cue plus c. 20 min game play) vs attention-placebo control (written activity log for same
duration) were both delivered in an emergency department within 6 h of a motor vehicle accident. The randomized controlled trial
compared the impact on the number of intrusive trauma memories in the subsequent week (primary outcome). Results vindicated
the efficacy of the Tetris-based intervention compared with the control condition: there were fewer intrusive memories overall, and
time-series analyses showed that intrusion incidence declined more quickly. There were convergent findings on a measure of
clinical post-trauma intrusion symptoms at 1 week, but not on other symptom clusters or at 1 month. Results of this proof-of-
concept study suggest that a larger trial, powered to detect differences at 1 month, is warranted. Participants found the
intervention easy, helpful and minimally distressing. By translating emerging neuroscientific insights and experimental research
into the real world, we offer a promising new low-intensity psychiatric intervention that could prevent debilitating intrusive
memories following trauma.

INTRODUCTION
After psychological trauma, sensory memories can recurrently
spring to mind unbidden,1 bringing back sights and sounds of the
events, evoking strong emotion, hijacking attention and pro-
foundly disrupting current activities. Intrusive memories comprise
a core clinical feature2 of acute stress disorder and post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD).1 In the first days post trauma, intrusive
memories (among other symptoms) have been associated with a
diagnosis of PTSD at 1 year,3 and early intrusion symptoms with a
non-remitting PTSD trajectory over 15 months.4 Intrusive mem-
ories also occur across a range of other mental disorders from
depression5 to complicated grief,6 comprising an important
transdiagnostic target7 for preventive psychiatric interventions.
However, currently preventive interventions after trauma target-
ing the full syndrome of PTSD are either ineffective8,9 or
unappealing/inaccessible10,11 to most people. New approaches
are needed—we suggest targeting preventive efforts on a focal
symptom—here, intrusive memories of the trauma.
We have called for the development of mechanistically driven
behavioural interventions,12 preferably low-intensity and deliver-
able by non-specialists to allow for scalability.13 A potential
treatment
opportunity
as
a
cognitive
'therapeutic
vaccine'
(ref 14, p 1315) delivered post trauma15 to limit the reoccurrence
of intrusive memories is offered by a combination of insights from
neuroscience. Memory consolidation theory suggests a time
window of several hours post trauma during which trauma memory
is malleable and vulnerable to disruption.16,17 Animal research
examining molecular and cellular processes in memory consolida-
tion demonstrates that it is possible to interfere with fear memory
stabilization soon after learning, for example, using the protein
synthesis inhibitor anisomycin.18–20 In humans, however, protein
synthesis inhibitors are toxic: studies using the β-blocker propra-
nolol as a consolidation blockade have not yet shown success,21,22
and
electroconvulsive
therapy,
while
effective
in
disrupting
memory,23 cannot be used readily in the aftermath of trauma.
Techniques are needed to target the intrusive nature of memories
specifically as this is associated with clinical impairment. Cognitive
science predicts that cognitive tasks with high visuospatial
demands will selectively disrupt sensory (predominantly visual)
aspects of memory (i.e. those that underpin intrusions) via
competition for limited cognitive resources24–26 when that memory
is labile. Combined, these insights suggest that engaging in
cognitive tasks with high visuospatial demands during the time

the
occurrence of subsequent intrusive visual memories of trauma.
Using an experimental analogue of a traumatic event (film
footage) under controlled laboratory settings, we have tested the
relative efficacy of various cognitive tasks in reducing intrusive
memories. In line with the hypotheses, the results show that
visuospatial tasks (e.g. complex pattern tapping) during or soon
after the event consistently lead to a reduction in the number of
subsequent intrusive memories,15,27–30 whereas some verbal tasks
(e.g. backwards counting; the verbal computer game Pub Quiz) do
not and can even increase intrusions indicating possible harmful
effects15,27,31,32 (though see Van den Hout and Engelhard33). We
suggest that visuospatial cognitive tasks act not merely via
distraction, but by modality-specific interference with sensory
(visual) aspects of intrusive memory. Critical to future translation
to real trauma, we have shown that a popular and widely available
visually absorbing computer game (playing 'Tetris')34 is also
effective as a component of a behavioural intervention compared
with control conditions (a verbal 'Pub Quiz' game or no task).15,29,35
In a parallel randomized controlled trial, we tested the
hypothesis that a behavioural intervention (playing the visually
absorbing computer game Tetris after a reminder cue), compared
with an attention-placebo (ref 36, p 191) control condition
(a written activity log), would reduce the number of intrusive
memories of trauma over the subsequent week. The control
condition was selected for nonspecific factors including time,
contact with the researcher, location of treatment procedure and
engagement
in
a
structured
task.
Unlike
the
intervention
condition, the control condition contained no reminder cue for
the traumatic event. Study information and materials referred to
'simple activities' in both conditions for credibility (Supplementary
Information). The primary outcome was the number of intrusive
memories 1 week post accident (as logged in a daily diary);
secondary outcomes were post-trauma symptomatology, anxiety
and depression (1 week/1 month). Participant feedback was
assessed at 1 month.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and procedure
Participants were 71 patients presenting to the emergency department of
the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK) (Figure 1): 34 were men and 37

or

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-
IV) PTSD criterion A1 for a traumatic event ('experienced, witnessed or was
confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened
death or serious injury'); seen in emergency department within 6 h of
leaving scene of the accident; reported memory of the accident; fluent in
written and spoken English; alert and orientated, Glasgow Coma Scale37
score = 15; and sufficient physical mobility to play a computer game on the
intervention platform (Nintendo DS) at the point of taking informed
consent. Exclusion criteria were loss of consciousness for 45 min, reported
history of severe mental illness, current intoxication, substance abuse or
neurological condition, or currently suicidal. The study was approved by
the local National Research Ethics Service Research Ethics Committee
(Oxford C: 12/SC/0485).
Potential participants were identified by emergency department staff.
Eligibility was assessed by a clinical psychologist (LI) using information
from medical records and face-to-face interview. After receiving a
description of the study, all participants provided written informed
consent before completing baseline measures. Participants were then
randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to two parallel treatment conditions using
a web-based randomization system, provided by the Oxford Cognitive
Health and Neurosciences Clinical Trials Unit and verified by independent
statisticians. Randomization was used to balance groups on known and
unknown baseline predictors of outcome,38 and carried out using
minimization39 based on gender, age and perceived life threat to self,
with an additional random component to ensure allocations remained
unpredictable. The randomization system was accessed by the researcher
(LI) from a separate office after baseline measures had been completed.
Participants were not informed as to condition allocation. The researcher
delivering the procedures (LI) was not blind to participant allocation, as the
need to provide verbal instructions precluded such blinding.
Outcome assessment was scheduled for 1 week and 1 month after the
accident. After 1-month follow-up, participants were contacted by
telephone and debriefed. They were offered a £30 GBP ($45 USD) store
voucher to compensate them for their time. Recruitment occurred
between March 2014 and January 2015. The last follow-up assessment
was completed in February 2015. The trial ended once the planned sample
size had been achieved.
Assessments
Traumatic event and emergency department treatment characteristics.
Details of participants’ traumatic event, treatment in the emergency
department and previous emergency department attendances were
collected from medical records. Severity of physical injury, indicated by
the Injury Severity Score (range 0–75), was rated using the Abbreviated
Injury Scale.40 Agreement for injury codings between raters (LI and a
research nurse) was 100%. Participants rated perceived life threat during
the accident: 'to what extent did you feel your life was in danger?' and 'to
what extent did you feel that someone else’s life was in danger?' from 0
(not at all) to 10 (extremely).41 Dissociative symptoms were assessed with
the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire-Self Report.42
Emotional responses were assessed with the Peritraumatic Distress
Inventory.43 Participants reported experience of prior psychological
trauma, current and past mental illness, and family history of mental illness.
Primary outcome.
The total number of intrusive memories in the week
after the traumatic event was assessed using a daily pen-and-paper diary
(adapted from refs 15,29,35). Participants recorded the occurrence of
intrusive memories in everyday life by ticking a box for the day and time
period (morning/afternoon/evening) when the intrusive memory occurred,
or marked 'zero' if they experienced none. Intrusive memories were
described as: 'image-based memories of the accident that pop into your
mind without warning. They often take the form of visual pictures in your
mind’s eye, for example, like a snapshot image or a film clip. They can also
include other senses, for example, sounds and smells'. Participants were
not to record memories recalled deliberately or general verbal thoughts.
For examples of intrusive memories see Supplementary Table 2. The diary
started on the day of the accident ('Day 1') and was completed for seven
days. Daily reminders to complete the diary were sent via SMS. Upon
completion,
participants
rated
'how
accurately
do
you
think
you
completed the diary?' from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). Participants
returned the diary by post. The number of intrusive memories was selected
for several reasons: it allows comparison with preclinical work; was readily
understood by traumatized patients without the need for explanation from
an expert; and is directly relevant to the clinical goal of reducing the
number of times the memory intruded (not just reducing its intensity).
Secondary outcomes.
Post-trauma distress was assessed using the Impact
of Event Scale—Revised,40,45 which has subscales for intrusion, avoidance
and hyperarousal symptoms. PTSD symptom severity was assessed with
the Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS; Foa46). Anxiety and depression
symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale.47 To minimize assessor bias and participant burden, measures were
completed remotely (online using the secure web-based software
'Qualtrics'48 or by post).
Participant feedback.
A 13-item feedback questionnaire assessed partici-
pants’ experience of the study. Items included ratings of how easy, helpful
and distressing/burdensome participants found playing Tetris on a scale
from 1 (not at all) to 9 (extremely), expectancy ratings for their condition
on number of intrusive memories on a 21-point scale from − 10 (extreme
decrease), 0 (no effect) to +10 (extreme increase)35 and open questions.
Treatment conditions
Participants in both treatment conditions received usual care in the
emergency department (e.g. assessments and medical treatment). The
condition-specific procedures below were delivered around usual care by a
clinical psychologist (LI). Both condition-specific procedures were standar-
dized and structured.
Intervention.
The intervention procedure involved two key components: a
reminder cue for the traumatic event followed by playing the computer
game Tetris.29 For the memory reminder cue, participants were asked to
think back to the accident and briefly tell the researcher the worst
moments that came to mind.49 Following instructions and practice,
participants played Tetris on a Nintendo DS XL. Participants were required
to undertake minimum Tetris game play for at least one uninterrupted
period of 10 min and for ~ 20 min in total.
Control.
In the control procedure participants filled in a simple activity log
to note down each activity they had already engaged in during their time
in the emergency department. They wrote brief entries in a list in a column
(e.g., reading, talking, receiving treatment, crossword, texting) and
recorded each activity’s duration (in minutes) in a second column.
Following instructions of how to complete the log, participants completed
it using pen-and-paper on a clipboard for ~ 20 min (a similar duration to
the intervention condition).
Time spent playing Tetris and filling the activity log was equivalent; and
total time spent in the emergency department, during which other
activities were unrestricted, was equivalent in the two conditions
(Supplementary Information).
Data analysis
Power analysis.
Using a conservative estimated effect size of Cohen’s
d = 0.7, based on a previous laboratory study,29 a total sample size of n = 66
was required to provide 80% power at α = 0.05, two-tailed. Recruitment of
at least 70 participants was planned to allow for attrition.
Main efficacy analyses.
Analyses were intention-to-treat, including all
randomized participants. Missing values were estimated using multiple
imputation. Five data sets were generated for each missing value at 1 week
follow-up, and 10 data sets for each missing value at 1-month follow-up, in
line with the recommendation that the number of data sets approximates
the percentage of missing data.50 Treatment group, age, gender and
perceived life threat to self were included as auxiliary variables.51 Estimates
were pooled in line with guidelines for multiple imputation.52 As all
between-group comparisons in continuous outcomes at 1 week and
1 month were planned a priori, differences were tested using two-tailed
t-tests at α = 0.05 (ref 53, p 372). Cohen’s d effect sizes were calculated as t
[Sqrt(1/n1+1/n2)], and 95% confidence intervals for the effect size were
calculated using ESCI software.54 Percentage of participants with a
symptom profile on the PDS consistent with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD
was compared between conditions using logistic regression (2 × 2 Χ2 test)
at α = 0.05, two-tailed. Efficacy analyses were conducted in SPSS version
2255 by the first author and verified by a statistician (PCW) blind to

 condition. Before analysis, 100% of raw data for the primary efficacy
analysis, and a randomly selected 10% of raw data for the secondary
efficacy analyses, were checked for accuracy by a researcher not involved
in data collection and blind to condition. Analyses were also conducted on
a 'per-protocol' population (Supplementary Table 3).

analyses.
To
investigate
the
time
course
of
intrusive
memories reported in the daily diary over the first seven days after the
accident, frequency scattergraphs showing the distribution of the number
of intrusive memories on each day per condition were plotted. A nonlinear
time-series analysis was used to produce a nonparametric line of best fit,
summarizing the distribution of the number of intrusive memories on each
day, smoothed from day to day over the 7-day period, by accounting for
the number of intrusive memories at nearby time points (autocorrelation).
This was achieved by fitting counts of the number of intrusive memories
for each participant (Y) through time (t) with a generalized additive
model:56

where u is a random variable of time and s(t, 4) is the smoother with four
effective degrees of freedom (as in James et al.35). Expected Poisson
distributions at day 2 and day 7 were generated. Time-series analyses were
undertaken in R using data provided by participants who returned the
diary (n = 67).

significant differences between conditions.
Treatment adherence, attrition and adverse effects
All participants allocated to the intervention condition completed
the memory reminder cue, and only one participant did not play
Tetris for the minimum required duration of 10 min uninterrupted
(they were moved by staff to a different bay). All participants
allocated to the control condition completed the activity log. Self-
report accuracy ratings for completion of the daily diary were high

 and did not differ between conditions. Attrition (whole sample)
was 6% at 1 week and 13% at 1 month. Further details regarding
diary completion accuracy ratings and attrition are provided in
Supplementary Information. No adverse effects (i.e., negative
reactions to the treatment procedures, such as significantly
increased distress or suicidality) were recorded in either condition.
Main efficacy analyses
Continuous outcomes were transformed to correct for skewness
using the natural logarithmic function with the exception of the
1-week Impact of Event Scale—Revised intrusion subscale score
(which approximated a normal distribution). Variances were
similar between conditions on all outcomes. Table 2 shows
intention-to-treat analyses for primary and secondary outcomes.
Per-protocol analyses showed the same pattern of results
(Supplementary Table 3).
Primary outcome.
Participants in the intervention condition
recorded significantly fewer intrusive memories in the week after
the accident than participants in the control condition, with a
medium effect size57 (M = 8.73 vs M = 23.26, t(69) = 2.80, P = 0.005,
d = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.18,1.14) (Figure 2a).
Secondary outcomes.
At 1 week follow-up, participants in the
intervention condition reported less distress from intrusion
symptoms (Impact of Event Scale—Revised intrusion subscale)
than participants in the control condition, with a medium effect
size (Table 2). Effect sizes for all other measures at one week, and
all measures at one month, were small to negligible (Table 2).
Exploratory analyses
From nonlinear time-series analysis, the generalized additive
model summarizing the distribution of the number of intrusive
memories on each of the first seven days after the accident
indicated fewer intrusive memories across the seven days, as well
as a more marked decline over the seven days, in the intervention
compared
with
the
control
condition
(Figure
2b).
Poisson
distributions revealed that the expected probability of having
zero intrusive memories showed a greater increase over time for
participants in the intervention condition (from 13.8% on day 2 to
59.3% on day 7) compared with participants in the control
condition (from 1.5% on day 2 to 5.6% at day 7) (Figure 3).
Participant feedback
Feedback ratings indicated that participants in the intervention
condition found playing Tetris very easy (median = 7), very
helpful
(median = 7)
and
minimally
distressing/burdensome
(median = 1).
Examples of participants’ experience of the intervention follow:
One woman in her 20s described having repeated intrusive
memories of her motor vehicle accident trauma: 'the picture of
falling on the street with my head kept popping up in my head'
and 'seeing blood dripping'. She engaged well with playing Tetris
in the emergency department and found it fun. 'I think it helped a
lot to distract my mind after [the] accident by playing Tetris'.
A woman in her 60s who had never played Tetris before, nor
used a Nintendo DS, described playing the game as 'good, really
fun'. She asked to continue playing for a little longer, even when
the 20-min intervention period was over. At the end of the study,
she commented: 'It certainly took my mind off of it at a time when
I probably would have sat brooding and feeling very sorry for
myself… when you're running the whole thing through your mind

 and you're on your own at a vulnerable time after the ambulance
crew have left you'.
One man in his late 30s described intrusive images of seeing
the tree just before the moment of collision, followed by the
white flash of the airbag. He wrote at the end of the study:
'I think that playing Tetris helped focus my mind and bring
some 'normality' back to my head. I didn't dwell on the
accident too much while I was in hospital. Playing Tetris seemed
a bit strange at the time, but looking back it has been a help.
Thank you'.
DISCUSSION
An experimental science-driven intervention to reduce intrusive
memories of real-world trauma, in patients presenting to a
hospital emergency department after a traumatic motor vehicle
accident involving directly experienced actual or threatened death
Figure 2.

intrusive memories recorded in a daily diary during the week
following a traumatic motor vehicle accident (intention-to-treat

intervention condition (n = 37, M = 8.73, s.d. = 11.55, range 0–55) and
the control condition (n = 34, M = 23.26, s.d. = 32.99, range 0–120):
t(69) = 2.80, P = 0.005, d = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.14. Error bars show

generalized additive model (see Equation (1)) to summarize the
number of intrusive memories through the 7-day period.

 or serious injury, was effective compared with an attention-
placebo
control.
This
hypothesis-driven
work
is
at
the
interface between preclinical and clinical research in psychiatry,
psychology
and
post-traumatic
reactions.
Its
principles
are
derived from molecular, cellular and neural research on memory
consolidation16,18–20
alongside
the
neuroscience
of
visual
memory,58 deploying a behavioural technique to modify emo-
tional intrusive memory. Results provide a critical and compelling
translation of previous laboratory findings with experimental
trauma15,29,35 to the ‘real world’. The behavioural intervention with
traumatized individuals comprised two steps: (i) a trauma memory
reminder cue, followed by (ii) engaging for at least 10 min in a
computer
game
with
high
visuospatial
demands
(Tetris)—
hypothesized to compete with consolidation of visual memories
of trauma. The intervention reduced the number of intrusive
memories by 62% in the subsequent week compared with control.
This result with patients compares favourably to previous
laboratory-based trauma simulation studies, which found, for
example, a relative reduction in intrusive memory count by 58%
over the same time period.29 Time-series analyses revealed an
accelerated recovery from intrusive memories over the first week
in the intervention condition, mirroring laboratory findings.35
There were convergent findings on a measure of clinical post-
trauma intrusion symptoms (Impact of Event Scale—Revised
intrusion subscale) at 1 week, but not on other symptom clusters
or at 1 month. The current study was designed to detect an effect
on the primary outcome measure at 1 week; results suggest that a
larger trial, powered to detect differences at 1 month, is
warranted.
This brief 'therapist-free' technological intervention was found
to be feasible and acceptable—with 48% of patients approached
agreeing to participate (compared with 10% in a psychotherapy
trial11 and 8% in a pharmacological trial,21 both also in the
emergency department), and with intervention completion at
97%. No adverse effects were observed or reported. Comparison
with the wider population of motor vehicle accident survivors
seen in the emergency department during the period of data
collection suggested our sample had a greater severity of physical
trauma (Supplementary Table 4). Patients were reached within a
short time post trauma (~3 h after their motor vehicle accident),
that is, within a memory consolidation time window as planned.
Our experimental medicine approach targets one core clinical
feature—intrusive memories of trauma—rather than a whole
psychiatric syndrome (ref 59, p 22). We found effects specific to
this subset of symptoms (cf. Soeter and Kindt60), that is, those
related to the hypothesized mechanisms of the intervention. After
a comprehensive therapy for full PTSD such as trauma-focussed
cognitive therapy, symptom clusters change together;61 that our
data suggests the possibility that specific symptom subsets may
be targeted raises intriguing questions about the disorder's
heterogeneity and inner structure.62 The distinction between
intrusive
vs
voluntarily
recalled
memories
is
important
for
treatment development. The critical difference between clinical
and non-clinical memories of a traumatic event is that the former
spring to mind unbidden (i.e. are intrusive), and not that a memory
of the traumatic event exists per se. Indeed, we have argued that
'erasure' of the whole trauma memory could be undesirable,63 as
patients may need to deliberately remember events, for example,
for legal testimony.
Preventive interventions post trauma are currently lacking.
Motor vehicle accidents are common traumatic events,64 and
after-effects in terms of mental disorder well established.65,66 In
the emergency department, patients typically wait up to 4 h or
more in the United Kingdom,67 providing an opportunity to reach
patients within a few hours of a traumatic event, that is, within the
putative timeframe for memory consolidation. The feasibility of
implementing the intervention68 is promising due to its brevity,
low cost, simplicity for training and delivery, and flexibility of
administration (Supplementary Information).
A brief, science-driven intervention offers a low-intensity means
that could substantially improve the mental health of those who
have experienced psychological trauma—and for we believe the
first time offers a cognitive 'therapeutic vaccine' (ref 14, p 1315)
that could be administered soon after a traumatic event (cf. rabies
vaccine after a dog bite) to prevent intrusive memories of trauma
in the subsequent week. It will be important to build on the
findings of this study to understand which intervention aspects
are critical. For example, our intervention comprised both a
trauma memory reminder and Tetris game play, in line with our
aim of translating to a clinical setting our earlier laboratory
findings during a putative time window for reconsolidation35 and
consolidation.15,29 The choice of including a reminder cue during
memory consolidation may be surprising, but recent experimental
work suggests that even then a cue may be critical.69 We reasoned
that reminder cues serve additional functions beyond reactivation
and rendering memory labile—such as orienting the interference
procedure to more targeted elements within the memory trace.
This idea is relevant for complex memories,70,71 here visual
elements of complex real-world trauma scenes. In contrast, in
animal studies in which pharmacological agents block the protein
synthesis necessary for memory consolidation,19 such blockade is
likely to affect multiple elements of a freshly encoded experience,
rather than one specific aspect. Further work is needed to unpick
this mechanism. We hypothesize that not only Tetris but any task
with high visuospatial demands is likely to be useful within the
procedure (e.g. games such as Candy Crush, drawing) unlike
predominantly verbally distracting tasks (e.g. reading, crosswords).
However, either element of the intervention in isolation (memory
reminder/visuospatial task) is unlikely to be effective.35
This is an early-phase or explanatory trial to establish the
efficacy of the intervention (ref 72, p 23), and the activity log was
selected to control for as many nonspecific confounding factors as
possible, while minimizing the potential for harmful effects.15,31
There is no comparator preventive treatment in the immediate
aftermath of trauma8,9,73 to use as a control. Future mechanism-
focussed research should seek improved controls: this requires
innovation, as in comparison with drug trials, for psychological
interventions it is challenging to create an 'inactive' control
that resembles the active treatment.74 While it is not possible
to blind participants in psychological trials, in the current
study
expectations
do
not
appear
to
be
associated
with
performance on the primary outcome measure (Supplementary
Information).
Preventive mental health interventions are needed post trauma.
Here we find a positive effect of the Tetris-based intervention
delivered soon after trauma in the emergency department on the
primary outcome measure—intrusive memories of trauma over
1 week. Future studies are needed, designed to test whether
effects extend to 1 month or longer. Only one 'dose' of the 20 min
intervention was given, and the opportunity to give multiple
doses and/or longer durations should be explored. The clinical
utility to patients of a brief intervention that reduces their
symptoms even if limited to the first week post trauma should also
be explored. Critically, as yet successful translations of contem-
porary neuroscience into mental health treatments have been
lacking. This study illuminates how combining clinical (trauma),
neuroscientific (memory consolidation) and cognitive (cognitive
task competition) theory can lead to a novel and effective clinical
technique—opening the way for other mechanistically driven
behavioural treatment innovations.
