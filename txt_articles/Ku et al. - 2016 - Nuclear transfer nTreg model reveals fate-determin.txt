To study the development and function of “natural-arising” T reg-
ulatory (nTreg) cells, we developed a novel nTreg model on pure
nonobese diabetic background using epigenetic reprogramming
via somatic cell nuclear transfer. On RAG1-deficient background,
we found that monoclonal FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells developed in
the thymus in the absence of other T cells. Adoptive transfer ex-
periments revealed that the thymic niche is not a limiting factor in
nTreg development. In addition, we showed that the T-cell recep-
tor (TCR) β-chain of our nTreg model was not only sufficient to bias
T-cell development toward the CD4 lineage, but we also demon-
strated that this TCR β-chain was able to provide stronger TCR
signals. This TCR-β–driven mechanism would thus unify former
per se contradicting hypotheses of TCR-dependent and -indepen-
dent nTreg development. Strikingly, peripheral FoxP3− CD4+ T cells
expressing the same TCR as this somatic cell nuclear transfer nTreg
model had a reduced capability to differentiate into Th1 cells but
were poised to differentiate better into induced nTreg cells, both in
vitro and in vivo, representing a novel peripheral precursor subset
of nTreg cells to which we refer to as pre-nTreg cells.

N
atural arising regulatory T (nTreg) cells play a pivotal role in
establishing and upholding peripheral tolerance (1, 2).
FoxP3 had been identified as a key transcription factor not only
important for the development of nTreg cells, but also for their
function (3, 4). Loss-of-function mutations in the FoxP3 gene
result in lack of Treg cells leading to widespread tissue inflam-
mations (5, 6). The development and selection of nTreg cells in
the thymus has been the subject of scientific debates for decades,
and two contradicting hypotheses have been formulated. Al-
though one hypothesis emphasized the development of nTreg
cells in a T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent manner, the other
hypothesis postulated a TCR-independent mechanism. The
TCR-dependent development is supported by the observation
that TCR transgenic models generated from non-Treg cells did
not possess any nTreg cells (7). In line with the TCR-dependent
hypothesis is the notion that Treg cells developed in non-Treg
TCR transgenic models only when the cognate antigen was
expressed in the thymus (8–10). The TCR-independent hypoth-
esis was proposed based on the observation that nTreg devel-
opment was favored in a subset of CD4− CD8− double-negative
(DN) cells before the expression of a full TCR on the surface,
and that development of Treg cells was less affected than that of
conventional CD4+ T cells in pre-TCR-α−/− (pTα) mice (11, 12).
Given that the pTα, together with TCR-β, is expressed as pre-
TCR at the CD4 CD8 DN stage 3 (DN3) before selection at the
CD4 CD8 double-positive (DP) stage, a TCR-independent Treg
development was indicated. In addition, although some studies
investigating the TCR repertoire of conventional T cells (Tconv)
and Treg cells demonstrated a partial overlap in support of the
TCR-independent hypothesis, other studies reported no gross
similarity of the TCR repertoire, in line with a TCR-dependent
development (13–15).
TCR transgenic mice have been valuable tools in better un-
derstanding the role of T cells in health and disease. Several
mouse models had been made to study the development and
function of nTreg cells. First studies used existing non-Treg TCR
transgenic mice and expressed the cognate antigen in the thymus
(10). This approach demonstrated that an nTreg-like phenotype
could be induced in the thymus. Other studies generated Treg
TCR transgenic models by isolating TCRs from Treg cells or by
using a fixed TCR β-chain approach (16–18). Surprisingly, none
of these Treg TCR transgenic models possessed any major nTreg
population (less than 0.1% of CD4+ T cells) in the thymus when
crossed onto a Rag-deficient background. This result had led to
the hypothesis that intraclonal competition might inhibit nTreg
development in a monoclonal setting, and was supported by the
observation that thymic Treg cells were found when bone mar-
row from TCR-transgenic and WT were mixed and injected into
lethally irradiated recipient mice.
We recently showed that epigenetic reprogramming through
somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) can be used to develop novel
T- and B-cell mouse models (19, 20). We hypothesized that in
SCNT mice, the more physiological TCR expression from the
endogenous TCR locus under the control of the endogenous
promoter and enhancer regions might facilitate better nTreg de-
velopment. Although our initial SCNT models were based on the
hybrid strain C57BL/6 × BALB/c F1 (B6CF1), we reasoned that
such F1-based SCNT models are not suitable for immunological
studies. Hence, to avoid well-known artifacts from hybrid strains,
we developed a novel SCNT Treg model on pure nonobese
Significance
T cells generate their T-cell receptors (TCR) through somatic
rearrangement of their underlying genomic V(D)J regions.
Contrary to previous transgenic TCR models, our TCR models
generated through somatic cell nuclear transfer are precise
copies of the original T cell. Here, we developed a novel so-
matic cell nuclear transfer model of natural arising regulatory T
(nTreg) cells. In our monoclonal model, we found a well-defined
nTreg population in the thymus, contradicting previous reports
that intraclonal competition and thymic niche are limiting fac-
tors in nTreg development. Moreover, we found a novel fate-
determining role for the TCR β-chain in nTreg cells. Interestingly,
we also discovered a novel T-cell subset that functions as pe-
ripheral precursor of nTreg cells.

Results
Generation of a Novel SCNT-Derived nTreg Model. We had pre-
viously shown that inhibitors of histone deacetylases could im-
prove SCNT of donor cells from pure BALB/c background (20).
Here, we applied the SCNT approach to donor Treg cells from
pure NOD background. To use an unbiased approach, we used
NOD-FoxP3GFP-Rag+/− mice in which the TCR-α and -β locus
were in WT configuration. FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells were sorted
from the spleen of healthy NOD-FoxP3GFP-Rag+/− mice using
flow cytometry, and used as donor cells for SCNT. Embryonic
stem cells were derived from resulting SCNT blastocysts, and used
to generate chimeric mice, as described previously (19, 20). A
single cross of these chimeric mice with NOD-Rag−/− resulted in
NOD-TCRαβ-FoxP3GFP-Rag−/− mice, which can be directly ana-
lyzed. We refer to this SCNT Treg line as T138. We first identified
the VJ rearrangement underlying the TCR-α as V9d-3-J26 com-
bination (Fig. 1A, Upper), and the V(D)J rearrangement of the
TCR-β as V15-D2-J2-5 (Fig. 1A, Lower). To determine whether
this SCNT model might represent an nTreg cell, we focused our
initial analysis on T138-Rag−/− mice. We found well-defined
FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells in the thymus of our SCNT-derived
model when crossed onto a Rag-deficient background. This result
clearly demonstrated that a monoclonal CD4+ T-cell population
could indeed give rise to nTreg cells when the physiological TCR
is expressed from the physiological locus under the control of the
endogenous promoter and enhancer regions (Fig. 1 B and C). We
determined that the percentage of thymic FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells
was about 1.5% of the CD4+ T cells in monoclonal T138-Rag−/−
mice. For comparison, polyclonal WT NOD mice possessed about
5% FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, although in the spleen the
percentage of FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells in T138-Rag−/− was higher
than in WT NOD mice (about 22% in T138 compared with about
12% in WT) (Fig. 1D), we found a relative decrease in mesenteric
lymph nodes (about 5% in T138 versus about 9% in WT) (Fig. S1;
see Fig. S2 for absolute numbers).
Thymic T-Cell Development After Adoptive Transfer. Previous
transgenic Treg models had virtually no Treg cell development in
the thymus when maintained on Rag-deficient background (16–18).
However, after adoptive transfer of bone marrow into irradiated
recipient mice, an increase in thymic Treg cells was observed. In
addition, the number of Treg cells in the thymus increased when
fewer bone marrow cells were transferred. This finding has led to
the conclusion that intraclonal competition might hamper Treg
development (21). As shown in Fig. 1, our SCNT-derived T138
had a well-defined thymic Treg cell population on Rag-deficient
background, thus demonstrating that nTreg cells can develop in a
monoclonal setting. However, to test whether there is an inverse
correlation between the number of transferred bone marrow cells

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
PNAS PLUS
 and the number of developing Treg cells in the thymus, we
performed a competitive adoptive transfer experiment by trans-
ferring bone marrow from T138-Rag−/− (CD90.2) and WT NOD
competitors (CD90.1) into irradiated NOD hosts (CD90.1-CD90.2
DP). We performed flow cytometric analysis of recipient mice 7 wk
after adoptive transfer, and found that the percentage of FoxP3+
CD4+ T cells from T138 was increasing with a decreasing amount
of transferred bone marrow cells (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3). Given the
variability in engraftment, we analyzed the development of thymic
FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells relative to the contribution of T138 to the
host. As shown in Fig. 2B, Left, we found an inverse correlation
(R2 = −0.785) between Treg cell development and bone marrow
contribution as had been reported previously (16–18). A com-
parison between the absolute numbers of FoxP3+ T cells in the
thymic CD4SP population revealed that even though the fre-
quencies of FoxP3+ T cells among the CD4SP cells increased, the
absolute numbers never reached those found in T138-Rag1−/−
mice (Fig. 2B, Right, blue dotted line, and Fig. S2A).
Cell Fate-Determining TCR-β in nTreg Cells. During our initial
breeding between T138 (NOD-TCRαβ-FoxP3GFP-Rag+/−) and
NOD-Rag1−/− or NOD-FoxP3GFP, we routinely analyzed the
spleen from these offspring. During this screen we found a rel-
ative increase in CD4+ T cells in about 50% of the offspring. This
was surprising because an increase in CD4+ T cells in a CD4+
TCR model is only observed when both the TCR α-chain and
TCR β-chain are present, which holds true for both traditional
transgenic and SCNT-derived T-cell models. An increase in
CD4+ T cells should only be seen in 25% of the offspring. Fur-
ther analysis revealed that expression of the TCR β-chain alone
with a WT TCR-α locus was sufficient to bias T cells away from
the CD8+ lineage and toward the CD4+ lineage in the spleen
(Fig. 3A) and lymph node (Fig. S4A), whereas the fraction of
FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells remained comparable to WT mice. To
determine whether this bias can already be seen during develop-
ment, we analyzed the thymus of T138β mice using flow cytometry.
As shown in Fig. 3B, a bias in T-cell development away from the
CD8+ lineage can already been found in the thymus. Given that
we had identified TRBV15 (also referred to as Vβ12) as part of
the TCR β-chain in T138, we analyzed the extent to which this
TCR β-chain can bias T-cell development (Fig. S4C). We found
that the majority (over 80%) of T cells developed into CD4+ T
cells in mice expressing the T138-derived TCR β-chain. In-
terestingly, we also found a small fraction (about 10%) of CD8+
T cells that were able to develop by using the T138-derived TCR
β-chain. Given that mice carrying one allele of the T138-derived
TCR β-chain possessed about 2% of CD4+ and 2% CD8+ T cells
that did not use the T138-derived TCR β-chain, we crossed this
TCR β-chain to homozygosity for future experiments, resulting
in T138-ββ. To determine whether TCR-levels are increased in
T138-ββ, we performed flow cytometric analysis. As shown in
Fig. S4D, FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells from WT, T138 and T138-ββ
mice expressed similar levels of TCR-β. Interestingly, although
FoxP3− CD4+ T-cell from WT and T138-ββ expressed similar
levels of TCR-β, T138 had a higher mean fluorescence intensity
because of the lack of T cells that expressed low levels of TCR-β
(red solid line).
Characterization of FoxP3− CD4+ T Cells in T138. Given that we
found conventional-like FoxP3− CD4+ T cells in thymus, spleen,
and lymph nodes expressing the same TCR as an nTreg cell, we
investigated whether these FoxP3− CD4+ T cells were anergic or
whether it might be possible to activate and differentiate these
cells in vitro. FoxP3− CD4+ T cells were isolated from the spleen
of T138-FoxP3GFP-Rag−/− mice and compared with WT NOD-
FoxP3GFP mice. Although it was indeed possible to differentiate
FoxP3− CD4+ T cells from T138 into Th1 cells, the overall ef-
ficiency was significantly lower than that of FoxP3− CD4+ T cells
from WT-derived T cells (about 21% for T138 versus 52% for
WT) (Fig. 4A). Given that we had observed a skewing of T-cell
development toward the CD4 lineage in mice expressing the
T138-derived TCR β-chain, we determined their ability to dif-
ferentiate into Th1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, FoxP3− CD4+ T
cells from T138β mice differentiated into Th1 cells with similar
efficiencies as WT cells. Of note, to ensure use of T138β, we
analyzed mice homozygous for the rearranged TCR-β (T138-ββ).
When we cultured FoxP3− CD4+ T cells under conditions that
favored Treg differentiation, we found that the majority of
FoxP3− CD4+ T cells from T138 differentiated into Treg cells,
with a significantly higher efficiency than both WT NOD control
T cells and T cells expressing T138-derived TCRβ-chain (71%
for T138 vs. 46% for WT and 47% for T138-ββ) (Fig. 4B). As
mentioned above, we found a small portion of T cells (about
10%) that developed into CD8+ T cells in mice expressing the
T138-derived TCR β-chain. To determine whether their plas-
ticity is impacted, we cultured these CD8+ T cells under condi-
tion that favor IFN-γ or FoxP3-expression. Strikingly, we found
that CD8+ T cells expressing the T138-derived TCR β-chain had
a significantly reduced capability to up-regulate FoxP3 (about
5% for CD8+ T138-ββ compared with about 26% for WT CD8+
T cells) (Fig. 4C), whereas their ability to up-regulate IFN-γ was
comparable to WT CD8+ T cells (Fig. S5A). Given this surprising
bias in T-cell differentiation during in vitro differentiation, we
performed adoptive transfer experiments to determine their dif-
ferentiation during homeostatic proliferation. As shown in Fig.
4D, FoxP3− CD4+ T cells from T138-Rag−/− mice differentiated
into FoxP3+ Treg cells significantly better than WT FoxP3− CD4+
T cells when adoptively transferred into NOD-Rag−/− mice.
It had been reported that recent thymic emigrants (RTE) are
enriched in cells that can differentiate better into FoxP3+ CD4+

 T cells (22). To determine whether the bias toward FoxP3 ex-
pression in FoxP3− CD4+ T cells in our T138 model is because of
an enlarged RTE population, we performed flow cytometric
analysis of thymus and spleen. As shown in Fig. S5 B and C, we
found no increase in RTE in the spleen of T138 (mean values:
2.77% in WT, 1.36% in T138-Rag−/−, and 2.41% in T138-ββ).
This finding indicated to us that the peripheral FoxP3− CD4+ T
cells expressing the same TCR as the nTreg model are not
conventional CD4+ T cells, but rather a precursor population
that is poised away from Th1 and toward Treg cells. Herein, we
refer to this novel T-cell subset as “pre-nTreg” cells.
TCR Strength in Pre-nTreg and nTreg Cells. Many reports pointed
toward an interaction between the TCR and its peptide-MHC
complex that might be of higher affinity in nTreg cells than the
average conventional CD4+ T cells (9, 23–26). Given that our
nTreg-derived TCR β-chain was capable of skewing thymic de-
velopment toward the CD4 lineage, as well as T-cell differenti-
ation, we wanted to determine whether this TCR β-chain might
be able to provide stronger TCR signal than WT CD4+ T cells. It
had been shown that Nur77 levels correlate directly with TCR
strength and are independent of any inflammatory stimuli (26).
Thus, we used endogenous Nur77 levels to determine the TCR
strength in our FoxP3+ nTreg and FoxP3− pre-nTreg cells, as
well as in FoxP3− and FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells expressing the T138-
derived TCR β-chain. As shown in Fig. 5, although the FoxP3+
population of CD4+ T cells expressing WT TCR or T138-derived
TCR β-chain maintained significantly higher Nur77 levels than
their FoxP3− counterparts, we observed no significant difference
between FoxP3− pre-nTreg and FoxP3+ nTreg cells from T138
mice. FoxP3− CD4+ T cells expressing T138-derived TCR
β-chain showed higher Nur77 levels than FoxP3− CD4+ T cells
from WT and T138 mice. Surprisingly, FoxP3+ CD4+ nTreg cells
had significant lower Nur77 levels than polyclonal FoxP3+ CD4+
T cells from WT mice, and FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells expressing
T138-derived TCR β-chain. Given our surprising finding that
CD4+ FoxP3− pre-nTreg and CD4+ FoxP3+ nTreg had similar
Nur77 levels, we decided to determine the levels of CD5. CD5
can function as a negative regulator of TCR signaling, and its
expression level is directly correlated to the TCR strength (27,
28). As shown in Fig. 5B, the CD5-levels of FoxP3+ and FoxP3−
CD4+ T cells in T138 are almost identical, thus confirming our
Nur77 data.
DNA Methylation and FoxP3 Expression in Pre-nTreg and nTreg Cells.
The presence of FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells on Rag-deficient back-
ground indicated that our SCNT-derived model represented
nTreg cells. However, to further validate that our novel mouse
model resembles nTreg cells, we performed DNA CpG-methyl-
ation analysis. The conserved noncoding sequence 2 in intron 1
of FoxP3 is also known as Treg-specific demethylation region
and has been shown to be hypomethylated in Treg cells (29–31).
A few additional loci have been suggested to play important roles
in Treg cells, including Il2ra and Ctla4 (32). To determine the
methylation status of these “Treg representative regions,” we
first focused on the FoxP3 locus in thymic CD4+CD8+ DP cells,
and splenic FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, we found
that the FoxP3 intron 1 in T138 and WT NOD mice was meth-
ylated in CD4+CD8+ DP cells, and completely demethylated in
splenic FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells. We also found that although the
FoxP3 locus upstream −1,500 bp (FoxP3 −1500) in T138 un-
derwent more CpG demethylation compared with WT (Fig. 6B,
Lower), the Il2ra intron 1a and Ctla4 exon 2 loci showed hypo-
methylated CpG in T138 at levels comparable to WT (Fig. 6 C
and D). Surprisingly, when we determined the methylation status
of the same loci in splenic FoxP3− CD4+ pre-nTreg cells, we
found the FoxP3 intron 1 locus as well as the other examined loci
with methylation levels comparable to WT FoxP3− CD4+ T cells
(Fig. 6 E–H).
To determine whether FoxP3 expression induced after in vitro
differentiation was maintained stable, we differentiated FoxP3−
CD4+ T cells from WT NOD, T138-Rag−/−, and mice expressing
the T138-derived TCR β-chain. After 4 d of in vitro differenti-
ation under FoxP3-inducing conditions, FoxP3GFP-expressing

 CD4+ T cells were sorted using flow cytometry, and split into two
groups. One group was cultured for an additional 5 d in the
absence of TGF-β, whereas the other group was used to de-
termine DNA methylation levels at the FoxP3 intron1 and −1500
locus. As shown in Fig. 6I, although most T cells expressing the
T138-derived TCR β-chain or WT T cells lost FoxP3 expression
(about 13% maintained FoxP3+), the majority of pre-nTreg cells
from T138 maintained FoxP3-expression (about 55%) in the
absence of TGF-β. To determine whether the differences in the
stability of FoxP3 expression are a result of changes in DNA
methylation, we determined the methylation status of the FoxP3
intron1 and −1500 locus. As shown in Fig. S6A, although the
overall methylation status of the tested region decreased slightly
compared with the ex vivo isolated CD4+ FoxP3− T cells (Fig. 6
E and F), we did not observe any significant differences among
the genotypes tested here. To test whether the FoxP3+ CD4+
T-cell population in T138-FoxP3GFP-Rag−/− maintained FoxP3-
expression in vivo, we adoptively transferred FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells
from T138 and WT NOD-FoxP3GFP mice into NOD-Rag−/−
mice. As shown in Fig. S6B, T138 maintained FoxP3-expression
at levels comparable to WT mice. To test FoxP3-stability in vitro,
we purified FoxP3GFP-expressing CD4+ T cells from WT, T138-
Rag−/− and T138-ββ mice and cultured these under indicated
conditions. As shown in Fig. 6J, we found that about 90% of
CD4+ T cells maintained FoxP3-expression when cultured in the
presence of TGF-β, IL-2, and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 independent
of the genotype. However, when TGF-β was removed from these
culture conditions, about 80% of the CD4+ T cells from T138
maintained FoxP3-expression, whereas only about 60% of CD4+
T cells from WT and T138-ββ maintained FoxP3-expression.
Transcriptional Profiling of Pre-nTreg and nTreg Cells. The presence
of FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells in the thymus of T138 on Rag-deficient
background, and the demethylation of Treg-signature genes in-
dicated that T138 indeed resembles an nTreg cell. In addition,
we found that FoxP3− CD4+ T cells from T138-Rag−/− mice
were poised toward Treg cells and thus resembled pre-nTreg
cells rather than conventional FoxP3− CD4+ T cells. Thus, we
performed RNA-Seq analysis to determine the transcriptional
differences between monoclonal FoxP3+ CD4+ nTreg and
FoxP3− CD4+ pre-nTreg cells from T138-FoxP3GFP-Rag−/− and
compared it with polyclonal FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells and poly-
clonal FoxP3− CD4+ T cells from NOD-FoxP3GFP mice. Genome-
wide hierarchical clustering of gene-expression data revealed
overall similarity between the four populations, with polyclonal
FoxP3− CD4+ T cells clustering closer to polyclonal FoxP3+ CD4+
T cells. Although monoclonal FoxP3+ CD4+ nTreg cells clustered
closer to polyclonal FoxP3+ and FoxP3− CD4+ T cells, monoclonal

 FoxP3− CD4+ pre-nTreg cells were most different from the other
three populations (Fig. 7A). Strikingly, FoxP3− CD4+ pre-nTreg
cells were most different from polyclonal FoxP3− CD4+ T cells
of WT mice. To better visualize differentially expressed genes
among all four cell populations, we generated fold-change/fold-
change (FC/FC) scatter plots (Fig. 7B). The ratio of (FoxP3+
T138 FC) versus (FoxP3− T138 FC) was plotted against the ratio
of (FoxP3+ WT FC) versus (FoxP3− WT FC). In this compari-
son, genes that are up-regulated in both nTreg and polyclonal
FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells from WT are found in the upper right
quadrant. This group contained several genes known to be
expressed in Treg cells, such as FoxP3, CD25, Ctla4, Ikzf2
(Helios), and Ikzf4 (Eos) (33–35). In Fig. S7A, the ratio of
(FoxP3+ T138 FC) versus (FoxP3+ WT FC) was plotted against
the ratio of (FoxP3− T138 FC) versus (FoxP3− WT FC). In this
comparison, genes that are up-regulated in both nTreg and pre-
nTreg cells are found in the upper right quadrant. We performed
network analysis to determine whether the FoxP3 network in
T138 differed from polyclonal FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells from WT
mice. As shown in Fig. S7 B and C, the FoxP3 network in
monoclonal nTreg cells differed greatly from polyclonal FoxP3+
CD4+ Treg cells, suggesting that the transcription factor FoxP3
and its cofactors may cooperate in a more concerted effort in
executing nTreg functions compared with heterogeneous poly-
clonal Treg cells in WT mice. We also performed transcription
factor target analysis to determine genes that contained FoxP3
binding motif in their promoter region and that were differen-
tially expressed between monoclonal nTreg cells and polyclonal
FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells. We found 33 genes with the FoxP3
binding motif that were significantly up-regulated in nTreg cells,
such as Erbb2, Rora, and Fos, and 26 genes that were up-regu-
lated in polyclonal FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells, including Bach2,
Ikzf4 (Eos), and Rorc (Fig. S8). In addition, the transcription
factor nuclear-factor of activated T cells (Nfat) has been shown
to play an important role in Treg cells (36–38). We found 79 genes
with an Nfat binding motif that were significantly up-regulated in
nTreg cells, including Il7r, Meis1, and Gata3, and 52 genes that
were up-regulated in polyclonal FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells, in-
cluding Nr4a3, Il6st, and Tiam1 (Fig. S9).
Discussion
To better understand the development and function of CD4+
nTreg cells, we developed a novel model using FoxP3+ CD4+ T
cells from the spleen of NOD mice as donor cells for SCNT. We
reasoned that in this novel SCNT model, both the pure back-
ground and the expression of the TCR from its physiological
locus should facilitate nTreg development. Indeed, our data
revealed that thymic FoxP3+ CD4+ nTreg cells did develop in the
thymus of SCNT-derived mice on Rag-deficient background
demonstrating that monoclonal nTreg cells did not require other
polyclonal T cells for their development, as previously hypothesized
(16–18). Our competitive bone marrow transfer experiment con-
firmed previous data showing an inverse correlation between the
contribution and relative frequency of Treg cells. However, a
closer look at the absolute numbers showed that the amount of
FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells in the thymic CD4SP population never
reached those found in T138-Rag−/− mice (Fig. 2B, blue dotted
line). This result demonstrated that the niche is not the limiting
factor in nTreg development. This finding is in contrast to previously
published data, in which the absolute number of FoxP3+ T cells in
the thymic CD4SP population after bone marrow transfer surpassed
the absolute number in the parental TCR transgenic line (16).
Strikingly, the TCR β-chain in our nTreg model had several
unique features: (i) when paired with an nTreg-derived TCR
α-chain it gave rise to FoxP3+ nTreg cells and FoxP3− pre-nTreg
cells; (ii) when paired with polyclonal TCR α-chains, T-cell de-
velopment was skewed toward the CD4 lineage, but without any
bias in T-cell differentiation toward Th1 or Treg in CD4+ T cells;
and (iii) when paired with polyclonal TCR α-chains giving raise
to CD8+ T cells, their differentiation was skewed away from
FoxP3-expression. Our results point toward a novel interaction
between nTreg-derived TCR β-chain and p-MHC-II, as well as
p-MHC-I that has so far been disregarded. In addition, we were
also able to demonstrate that an nTreg-derived TCR β-chain can
provide stronger TCR signals. To our knowledge, this is the first
report of any TCR β-chain with such a major impact on T-cell
development, T-cell differentiation, and TCR strength. Given
that the TCR β-chain rearranges first and is presented on the
surface at the DN3 stage, we propose herein a model in which
nTreg development is initially determined by TCR β-chains in a
first step (Fig. 8). This TCR-β–deterministic model would unify
the two current per se contradictory hypotheses of TCR-
dependent and -independent nTreg development (7–15). We hy-
pothesize that as part of the TCR complex, some unique TCR
β-chains are able to direct development toward the CD4 lineage
in a first step, requiring an nTreg-permissive TCR α-chain in a
second step to fully commit to either pre-nTreg or nTreg cells.
This TCR β-deterministic model is further supported by data
demonstrating that Treg development was negatively impacted
in a TCR transgenic mouse model expressing a TCR β-chain
from a CD8+ T-cell (39). We hypothesize that a unique inter-
actions between TCR β-chains and p-MHC-II might provide
sufficient signal to drive nTreg development, which would ex-
plain why their development is less impacted in preTCR-α−/−

 mice, and why preferential nTreg development can be observed
in a subpopulation of developing T cells at the DN stage, hence a
seemingly TCR-independent development (11). The existence of
unique TCR β-chains that support nTreg development, would thus
also explain why most TCR-transgenic mouse models do not
contain any nTreg cells, and hence argue for a TCR-dependent
development.
Using a Nur77-GFP reporter mouse, it had been shown that
Treg cells possess higher TCR strength than conventional CD4+
T cells (26). It is commonly believed that this is a result of a
higher affinity for self-peptides referred to as agonist. However,
in light of our new data demonstrating that nTreg-derived TCR
β-chain can provide stronger TCR signal, and in line with our
data demonstrating no significant difference in TCR strength
between FoxP3− pre-nTreg and FoxP3+ nTreg cells, we hy-
pothesize that recognition of agonists might play a less dominant
role in nTreg development than previously hypothesized. This
observation is further supported by our data, demonstrating that
there is also no difference in CD5-levels between the FoxP3− and
FoxP3+ CD4+ population in our T138 model. Given that no
physiological agonists of nTreg cells have been identified so far,
more studies are needed to determine the role of nTreg TCR
β- and α-chains, and their interaction with peptide-MHC in nTreg
development.
As shown, our SCNT-derived nTreg model contained FoxP3−
CD4+ T cells in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes when
maintained on Rag-deficient background. These FoxP3− CD4+
T cells expressed the same TCR as nTreg cells. Differentiation

 experiments showed that these FoxP3− CD4+ T cells could dif-
ferentiate at high efficiency into FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells, whereas
their differentiation into Th1 cells was significantly less efficient
compared with CD4+ T cells from WT or T138-ββ mice (Fig. 4).
Strikingly, when FoxP3− CD4+ T cells were adoptively transferred
into Rag-deficient mice, these cells readily differentiated into
FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells. In addition, once FoxP3-expression was in-
duced in pre-nTreg cells in the presence of TGF-β, it was main-
tained and expressed in the majority of cells in the absence of TGF-β,
contrary to FoxP3-induced cells from WT and T138-ββ mice
(Fig. 6I). Surprisingly, this more stable expression of FoxP3 was
not a result of demethylation of the Treg-specific demethylation

 region (Fig. S6A). We were also able to show that FoxP3+
CD4+ nTreg cells in T138 maintained a more stable FoxP3-
expression in the absence of TGF-β than FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells
from WT and T138-ββ mice (Fig. 6J). Clearly, this poised state in
FoxP3− CD4+ T cells was only evident in mice carrying the nTreg
TCR αβ-pair, and was not because of an increase in recent thymic
emigrants (22). Given this strong bias in differentiation away from
Th1 and toward Treg cells and their expression of an nTreg-
derived TCR, we consider this T-cell subset as peripheral precursors
of nTreg cells, and hence refer to these cells as pre-nTreg cells
and not conventional CD4+ T cells (Fig. 8). This model is further
supported by our data demonstrating that FoxP3− CD4+ T cells
expressing the nTreg-derived TCR β-chain alone had no bias in
their plasticity (Fig. 4). However, the uniqueness of the nTreg-
derived TCR β-chain was further supported by their ability to
reduce the ability of CD8+ T cells to differentiate into FoxP3-
expressing CD8+ T cells, whereas having no impact on the dif-
ferentiation into IFN-γ–expressing CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4C and
Fig. S4A). This finding indicated that FoxP3-inducible CD8+ T
cells might possess TCRs different from the conventional CD8+
T-cell pool. The existence of FoxP3− CD4+ pre-nTreg cells could
also explain why studies that focused on the comparison of TCRs
in the pool of conventional T cells and Treg cells found a certain
degree of overlap (13–15). In light of our data, we interpret these
results not as an overlap of TCRs in conventional T cells and
Treg cells, but as existence of pre-nTreg cells within the con-
ventional T-cell population and an overlap of TCRs between
pre-nTreg and nTreg cells.
Although the CpG-methylation analysis of Treg-signature
genes confirmed that our SCNT-derived model indeed re-
sembled nTreg cells (Fig. 6), it did not explain the poised pre-
nTreg phenotype. Thus, future studies on the epigenetic differ-
ences in nTreg and pre-nTreg cells, such as DNA methylation of
additional loci, histone modifications, and microRNAs are
needed to provide new insights into the poised nature of pre-
nTreg cells. Given that most experiments use polyclonal CD4+ T
cells to differentiate T cells into Treg cells and other T-cell
subpopulations, most of these experiments might start with a mix
of pre-nTreg and so-called Tconv cells and resulting Treg cells
might resemble a mix of FoxP3-induced Treg cells. This would be
in analogy to the CD8+ T-cell compartment, which had been
shown to be more complex than previously appreciated (40, 41).
In light of the data presented here, we hypothesize that other
T-cell subsets might exist within the plenitude of Tconv cell
population with a bias in their differentiation capacity toward
any T-cell lineage.
Given the very unique situation that pre-nTreg and nTreg cells
express the exact same TCR, we performed transcriptome
analyses to better understand their differences. We used polyclonal
FoxP3− and FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells for comparison. As shown in Fig.
7, we were able to identify several genes that were differentially
expressed among those populations. However, given that the
polyclonal FoxP3− CD4+ T-cell population might contain a mix of
pre-nTreg and Tconv cells, and that the FoxP3+ CD4+ T-cell
population might contain a mix of nTreg and peripherally derived
Treg (pTreg) cells, the obtained results must be evaluated critically.
A comparison between monoclonal pre-nTreg and nTreg cells
revealed unique transcriptional signatures and transcription net-
works that might provide new insights into the function of nTreg
cells. However, more mouse models are needed to identify unique
signatures, transcriptions factors, and surface molecules to un-
mistakably identify these novel T-cell subpopulations.
Our SCNT nTreg model presented here is in stark contrast to
the previously published transgenic Treg models (16–18). Of
note, two of these transgenic Treg models were generated using
a previously isolated TCR β-chain, such as TRBV6-D1-J2.2 from
a CD4+ transgenic model recognizing the huCLIP81–104 peptide
(16). In addition, the FoxP3− CD4+ T-cell population in these
Treg transgenic models did not up-regulate FoxP3 upon transfer
into lymphopenic hosts (16, 17). Strikingly, our nTreg model
demonstrated a well-defined thymic FoxP3+ CD4+ T-cell pop-
ulation, a TCR β-chain that did impact T-cell development, plas-
ticity, and TCR strength, and the existence of a poised pre-nTreg
subset. The observed differences could be because of the approach
used (transgenic vs. SCNT), the background of mice (B6 vs. NOD),
or could represent different flavors of nTreg cells. However, given
the unique features of our nTreg-derived TCR β-chain, an alter-
native hypothesis that has not been considered so far is that the
previously published Treg models might represent pTreg cells.
This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the biggest
FoxP3+ population found in one of the transgenic Treg models
can be found in the prostate and its draining lymph node (18).
Taking these data together, we demonstrated herein that our
SCNT-derived nTreg model provided new insights into nTreg
cell biology. Our data are based on the characterization of a
single nTreg model, and more Treg models are needed to de-
termine the characteristics that are, for example, shared by all
nTreg cells. One interesting question, in our opinion, is whether
there are any nTreg cells that can exist entirely in a FoxP3+ state.
We were able to identify a new role for TCR β-chain, which
offered an explanation for previously reported TCR-dependent
and -independent mechanisms of nTreg cell development. In
addition, we identified a previously unknown pre-nTreg subset,
which is capable of differentiating into FoxP3-expressing cells at
high efficiency while almost losing its property to differentiate
into Th1 cells. It remains to be determined whether pre-nTreg or
nTreg cells can infiltrate inflamed organs more efficiently, and
can execute regulatory functions better. The existence of such
pre-nTreg cells provides novel therapeutic opportunities, in which
drugs that, for example, specifically activate pre-nTreg cells might
facilitate the establishment of a suppressive environment, possibly
in an organ-specific manner. Consequently, novel and more Treg
models are needed to better understand the molecular and func-
tional differences between pre-nTreg, nTreg, and pTreg cells.
Materials and Methods
Mice and Nuclear Transfer. All mice experiments were approved by the In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Scripps Research Institute.
Details are given in SI Materials and Methods.
TCR Identification. TCR was identified as previously described (19). Briefly,
RNA was isolated from splenocytes of SCNT mice (Macherey Nagel), and
reverse-transcribed into cDNA (Bio-Rad). PCR was performed using sets of
degenerate primers or 5′-RACE. Results were analyzed using the Ensembl
Genome Browser (ensembl.org) and the international ImMunoGeneTics in-
formation system (www.imgt.org).
Flow Cytometric Analysis and Cell Sorting. Single-cell suspensions of thymus,
spleen, or mesenteric lymph node were prepared and red blood cells were
lysed. Cells were incubated with various combinations of the following an-
tibodies: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD25, CD44, CD62L, CD69, CD90.1, Foxp3,
γδ-TCR, NK1.1, and Vβ12 (eBioscience and Tonbo). Samples were collected
using FACS LSRII (BD) or sorted using FACSAria (BD), and data were analyzed
with FlowJo software (Tree Star). Differences between groups were ana-
lyzed using two-tailed t test (Graphpad Prism software).
T-Cell Differentiation. Details on T-cell differentiation are given in SI Materials
and Methods.
FoxP3 Stability After in Vitro Differentiation. Foxp3GFP− CD4+ T cells were
sorted from the spleen of the indicated mice using flow cytometry. For Treg
differentiation, 1 × 105 T cells were stimulated with IL-2 (100 U/mL), TGF-β
(5 ng/mL; Tonbo), anti–IFN-γ (10 μg/mL; Tonbo), and Dynabeads Mouse
T-Activator CD3/CD28. Four days later, FoxP3GFP-expressing T cells were sorted
using flow cytometry and placed back in culture with IL-2 (100 U/mL), anti–
IFN-γ (10 μg/mL; Tonbo), and Dynabeads Mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28. FoxP3
staining was performed by FoxP3/transcription factor staining kit (Tonbo).

 Nur77 Assay. CD4+ T cells were sorted from the spleen of NOD, T138-ββ, or
T138-Rag−/− mice and activated with Dynabeads Mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28
in the presence of IL-2. Cells were harvested 5 h after activation and endog-
enous Nur77 levels were determined using flow cytometry (eBioscience).
Competitive Bone Marrow Transfer. Bone marrow was enriched for progenitor
and stem cell population using magnetic separation (Stemcell Technologies).
A total of 1 × 105 purified bone marrow cells from NOD-CD90.1 and T138-
Rag−/− (CD90.2) mice were mixed at indicated ratios and injected in-
travenously into irradiated NOD (CD90.1+ CD90.2+) host mice. Recipient mice
were analyzed 7 wk after adoptive transfer.
CpG-Methylation Analysis. All experiments were carried out using male mice.
Genomic DNA from indicated cells was extracted using Nucleospin DNA
isolation kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (Macherey-Nagel). DNA
was then bisulfite treated using Methylcode Bisulfite Conversion kit (Life
Technologies). Gene-specific primers were used to amplify genomic regions
of interest, as published elsewhere (32). Sequencing data were analyzed
using the QUMA (quantification tool for methylation analysis) web-based
platform (42).
RNA-Seq and Data Analysis. Details on RNA-preparation, processing, and
generation of RNA-Seq libraries, as well as data analysis, are given in SI
Materials and Methods.
