ABSTRACT
Detailed anatomical understanding of the human brain is
essential for unraveling its functional architecture, yet cur-
rent reference atlases have major limitations such as lack
of whole-brain coverage, relatively low image resolution,
and sparse structural annotation. We present the first digital
human brain atlas to incorporate neuroimaging, high-
resolution histology, and chemoarchitecture across a com-
plete adult female brain, consisting of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 1,356
large-format cellular resolution (1 mm/pixel) Nissl and
immunohistochemistry anatomical plates. The atlas is com-
prehensively annotated for 862 structures, including 117
white
matter
tracts
and
several
novel
cyto-
and
chemoarchitecturally defined structures, and these annota-
tions were transferred onto the matching MRI dataset.
Neocortical delineations were done for sulci, gyri, and modi-
fied Brodmann areas to link macroscopic anatomical and
microscopic cytoarchitectural parcellations. Correlated neu-
roimaging and histological structural delineation allowed
fine feature identification in MRI data and subsequent struc-
tural identification in MRI data from other brains. This inter-
active online digital atlas is integrated with existing Allen
Institute for Brain Science gene expression atlases and is
publicly accessible as a resource for the neuroscience com-
munity. J. Comp. Neurol. 524:3127–3481, 2016.

RESEARCH ARTICLE
 The advent and improvement of noninvasive techni-
ques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), func-
tional (f)MRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have
vastly enriched our understanding of the structure, con-
nectivity, and localized function of the human brain in
health and disease (Glover and Bowtell, 2009; Evans
et al., 2012; Amunts et al., 2014). Interpretation of these
data relies heavily on anatomical reference atlases for
localization of underlying anatomical partitions, which
also provides a common framework for communicating
within and across allied disciplines (Mazziotta et al.,
2001; Toga et al., 2006; Bonnici et al., 2012; Evans
et al., 2012; Caspers et al., 2013a; Annese et al., 2014).
While neuroimaging data are typically registered to prob-
abilistic reference frameworks (Das et al., 2016) to deal
with interindividual variation, they lack the cytoarchitec-
tural resolution of single-brain histological reference
atlases (Evans et al., 2012; Caspers et al., 2013a), which
is essential for more detailed studies of structural and
cellular organization of the brain. There is therefore a
strong need to bridge these levels of resolution to under-
stand structure–function relationships in the human
brain (Caspers et al., 2013a; Pascual et al., 2015).
A tremendous amount of effort has been dedicated to
histology-based parcellation of discrete regions of the
human brain, including the frontal, parietal, temporal,
occipital, cingulate, and perirhinal cortices (Hof et al.,
1995a; Van Essen et al., 2001; Vogt et al., 2001; €
Ong€
ur
et al., 2003; Scheperjans et al., 2008; Zilles and Amunts,
2009; Ding et al., 2009; Ding and Van Hoesen, 2010;
Goebel et al., 2012; Petrides and Pandya, 2012; Caspers
et al., 2013b), and other regions such as the thalamus,
amygdala, hippocampus, and brainstem (e.g., De Olmos,
2004; Garc
�
ıa-Cabezas et al., 2007; Jones, 2007; Morel,
2007; Mai et al., 2008; Ding et al., 2010; Paxinos et al.,
2012; Ding and Van Hoesen, 2015). Currently available
large-scale histological reference atlases of the human
brain vary substantially in their degree of brain coverage,
information content, and structural annotation (Table 1),
and much of the more recent work is absent in these
atlases. The most commonly used cytoarchitecture-
based human brain atlas is Brodmann’s cortical map
(Brodmann, 1909; Talairach and Tournoux, 1988; Simic
´
and Hof, 2015), particularly for its use in annotating
fMRI data, although von Economo’s (von Economo and
Koskinas, 1925) and Sarkisov’s (Sarkisov et al., 1955)
cortical maps are also still referenced. More recently
developed large-scale atlases possess greater anatomical
coverage and multimodal information content, but are
generally limited by their degree of structural delineation,
particularly for neocortical areas that are often refer-
enced only by gyral patterning (Duvernoy, 1999; Fischl
et al., 2004; Damasio, 2005; Mai et al., 2008; Naidich
et al., 2008; Destrieux et al., 2010; Nowinski and Chua,
2013). To overcome these limitations, a 3-dimensional
(3D) model of an adult human brain based on whole-
brain serial sectioning, silver staining, and MRI (Amunts
et al., 2013) was recently created, and a probabilistic
cytoarchitectural atlas (JuBrain; see Caspers et al.,
2013a) is also being generated. However, the staining of
these specimens is limited, the imaging of the histology
data currently lacks cellular resolution, and detailed
annotation or parcellation of all brain regions based on
cytoarchitecture remains to be performed. Additional
efforts have used ultra-high-resolution MRI of ex vivo
brains to build intrinsically 3D models of cytoarchitec-
tural boundaries, and quantify the predictive power of
macroscopic
features
for
localizing
microscopically
defined boundaries (Augustinack et al., 2005, 2010,
2012, 2013, 2014; Fischl et al., 2008, 2009; Iglesias
et al., 2015). While these latter atlases represent major
advances, currently available resources still lack many
features of modern atlases available in rodents and non-
human primates such as multimodality, dynamic user
interfaces with scalable resolution and topographic inter-
activity,
and
brain-wide
anatomic
delineation
with
ordered hierarchical structural ontologies.
We aimed to develop an adult human brain atlas with
many of the features of modern digital atlases in model
organisms (Lein et al., 2007; Saleem and Logothetis,
2012; Papp et al., 2014). First, the atlas requires whole-
brain coverage with neuroimaging (MRI, DWI) and histolo-
gy using multiple stains in the same brain, allowing brain
parcellation based on convergent evidence from cyto-
and chemoarchitecture, to reflect functional properties of
corresponding brain regions more accurately (Ding et al.,
2009; Amunts et al., 2010; Caspers et al., 2013a,b; Pasc-
ual et al., 2015). Second, we aimed for true cellular reso-
lution
(1 mm/pixel)
on
histological
images
to
link
microscopic features with the macroscopic scales more
common in neuroimaging studies. Most critically, we per-
formed comprehensive structural annotation at a very
detailed level, based on a hierarchical structural ontology
and using multiple forms of neocortical annotations to
link gross anatomical (gyral, sulcal) and histology-based
parcellation schemes modified from Brodmann. Finally,
these data are combined in an interactive, publicly acces-
sible online application with direct linkage to other large-
scale human brain gene expression databases (http://
human.brain-map.org; Hawrylycz et al., 2012).

 diseases or remarkable brain abnormality obtained from
the University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank, a
brain and tissue repository of the NIH NeuroBioBank.
All work was performed according to guidelines for the
research use of human brain tissue and with approval
by the Human Investigation Committees and Institution-
al Ethics Committees of the University of Maryland, the
institution from which the sample was obtained.
General tissue processing
A general workflow for generating this atlas is shown
in Figure 1. After the brain was removed from the skull,
4%
periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde
(PLP)
was
injected into the internal carotid and vertebral arteries
following a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) flush. The
brain was then suspended and immersed in 4% PLP at
48C. This preparation appeared to result in a slight
elongation of the brain. Following complete fixation (48
hours), the brain was subjected to MRI and DWI (see
details below) and stored in PLP at 48C until further
processing. The fixed brain was bisected through the
midline.
Following
agarose
embedding,
each
hemi-
sphere was cut with a flexi-slicer in the anterior to pos-
terior direction, resulting in eight 2-cm-thick slabs. The
slabs were cryoprotected in PBS containing 10%, 20%,
and 30% sucrose, respectively and then frozen in a dry
ice/isopentane bath (between 2508C and 2608C).
Finally, the frozen slabs were placed in plastic bags
that were vacuumed sealed, labeled, and stored at
2808C until histological sectioning.
Sectioning was performed by Neuroscience Associ-
ates (Knoxville, TN). The slabs were individually thawed
rapidly in PBS, treated overnight with 20% glycerol and
2% dimethylsulfoxide to prevent freezing artifacts, and
embedded in a gelatin matrix using MultiBrainV
R Technol-
ogy (NeuroScience Associates) to avoid loss of uncon-
nected tissue. After curing in a 2% formaldehyde
solution, the blocks were rapidly frozen by immersion in
isopentane (chilled by crushed dry ice) and mounted on
the frozen stage of a hydraulically driven sliding micro-
tome (Lipshaw model 90A, Pittsburgh, PA). Each block
was sectioned coronally in 50-lm-thick sections. All
sections were collected sequentially (none were dis-
carded) into a 4 3 6 array of containers filled with an
antigen preserving solution (50% PBS, pH 7.0, 50% eth-
ylene glycol, 1% polyvinyl pyrrolidone). During section-
ing, block-face images were taken at intervals of 10–12
sections. Due to the challenges of sectioning and
mounting thin sections from complete hemispheres,
certain artifacts in the tissue sections are present.
These artifacts include large cracks through most of
the section in some cases as well as smaller tears in
white and gray matter structures. In general these
artifacts are easily identifiable but should not be con-
fused with structural features of the underlying tissues.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Out of 2,716 total sections, 679 (200-mm sampling
interval) were mounted on gelatin-coated 3- 3 5-inch
glass slides, air-dried, and stained for Nissl substance
using 0.05% thionine in acetate buffer (pH 4.5). For
immunohistochemistry, 339 sections (400-mm sampling
interval)
were
immunostained
free-floating
for
the
calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) and 338 sec-
tions (400-mm sampling interval) for nonphosphorylated
neurofilament proteins (NFPs). All incubation solutions,
from blocking serum onward, used Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) with Triton X-100 as the vehicle; all washes were
done in TBS after antibody and avidin–biotin–horserad-
ish peroxidase (HRP) incubation. Following treatment
with hydrogen peroxide and a blocking serum, tissue
sections were immunostained with antibody SMI-32
(1:3,000, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and a monoclonal
anti-PV antibody (1:10,000, Swant, Marly, Switzerland)
overnight (�16 hours) at room temperature, with vehi-
cle solutions containing Triton X-100 for permeabiliza-
tion. A biotinylated secondary antibody (1:150, Vecta
Elite horse anti-mouse, preabsorbed against rat IgG,
Vector Burlingame, CA) and ABC solution (1:200, Vec-
tastain Elite ABC kit, Vector) were then applied for 90
and 45 minutes, respectively. To complete this process,
sections were treated with nickel-diaminobenzidine tet-
rahydrochloride (DAB) and hydrogen peroxide.
Antibody characterization
The antibody against NFP (BioLegend, Cat.# SMI-32,
RRID: AB_2314904) is a mouse monoclonal IgG1 recog-
nizing a double band at MW 200,000 and 180,000,
which merge into a single neurofilament H line on 2D
blots (Sternberger and Sternberger, 1983) (Table 2).
The immunostaining of sections through human tempo-
ral cortex produced a pattern of NFP labeling that was
identical to previous descriptions (Ding et al., 2009). In
human and monkey cerebral cortex, the antibody stains
a subpopulation of large pyramidal neurons with the
labeling largely restricted to dendritic processes and
soma
(Campbell
and
Morrison,
1989;
Hof
et
al.,
1995a,b; Nimchinsky et al., 1997; Ding et al., 2003,
2009).
The anti-PV antibody is a mouse monoclonal IgG1
(Swant, Cat.# 235, RRID: AB_10000343). This antibody
was produced by immunizing mice with PV from carp
muscle and hybridizing mouse spleen cells with myelo-
ma cell lines. This antibody specifically stained the
1999Ca-binding “spot” of PV (MW 12,000) from rat cer-
ebellum on 2D immunoblot assays (Celio et al., 1988)
3130

Ding et al.
 (Table 2). No staining was observed when the antibody
was used to stain cortical tissues from PV knockout
mice. This antibody labels subsets of nonpyramidal neu-
rons in cerebral cortex of many species including
human (Hof et al., 1999; Nimchinsky et al., 1997; Ding
and Van Hoesen, 2010, 2015).
Digitization of all stained sections
A custom-designed large-format microscopy system
was created to allow digital imaging and processing of
all histologically stained sections (Nikon, Melville, NY).
The system operates by collecting hundreds of images
in lengthwise strips, which are montaged to create a

 single hemispheric image at 1 lm/pixel resolution. A
total of 1,356 sections on 3- 3 5-inch slides were digi-
tized for this resource, of which a single section (repre-
sentative dimension: �3.2 3 4.3 m) typically took 6–
8 hours to complete. Exposure time, white balance, and
flat-field correction were set independently for each
slide. The Nikon NIS-Elements Advanced Research (AR)
microscope imaging software suite (RRID: SCR_014329)
was used for acquisition of ND2 format image files that
were subsequently converted to TIFF format.
Digital atlas design and annotation
For detailed anatomical delineation, 106 Nissl-stained
sections were selected out of 679. Sampling intervals
varied from 0.4 to 3.4 mm across the full anterior–pos-
terior (A-P) extent of the entire left hemisphere. Sparser
sampling (3.4 mm) was selectively applied to the most
anterior (prefrontal) and posterior (occipital) cortical lev-
els that primarily contain cortex and a few large subcor-
tical structures. Where smaller subcortical structures
are more abundant, a much denser sampling was used
(0.4–1.0-mm interval). In total, 862 brain structures
were digitally annotated on the 106 whole-hemisphere
images using 11,398 polygons.
Anatomical delineations were performed on poster-
sized printouts of Nissl-stained sections and then digi-
tally scanned and registered to the original Nissl
images. Structure outlines were converted to digital pol-
ygons using Adobe (San Jose, CA) Creative Suite 5, and
converted to Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format for
web utilization. Polygons were linked to the hierarchical
structural ontology and color-coded according to the
ontology color scheme such that related structures fall
into similar
color groups. Furthermore, hues were
assigned according to the relative cellular density of
the structure: the higher the density, the deeper the
shade (i.e., addition of black to hue); the lower the den-
sity, the deeper the tint (i.e., addition of white to hue).
Magnetic resonance and diffusion-weighted
imaging
High-resolution
structural
imaging
was
performed
using special coils designed to optimize signal-to-noise
and contrast-to-noise ratios (SNR and CNR, respective-
ly)
in
fixed
specimens
by
reducing
large
spacing
between the coil elements and the sample. DWI was
performed using standard Siemens head coils. Sample
packing was performed by vacuum-sealing the brain
specimen in a polyethylene storage bag surrounded by
PLP to avoid any artifacts caused by the interface
between air and tissue. Diffusion-weighted images were
collected on a 3 T TIM Trio whole-body scanner (Sie-
mens Medical Solutions, Erlanger, Germany) with a Sie-
mens 32 channel head coil. High-resolution structural
images were acquired using a 7 T scanner (Siemens
Medical Solutions) with a custom 30-channel receive-
array coil designed to image the entire adult brain, uti-
lizing a 36-cm head gradient coil.
For the 7 T scans, custom pulse sequence software
was used to measure k-space in “chunks” small enough
to be held in the scanner hard disk buffer, and a sys-
tem was developed to stream each “chunk” of data
from the buffer to a multiterabyte RAID array in parallel
with it being measured by the scanner. Systems inte-
gration and custom software were developed for fast,
reliable network and RAID connections and data stream
management. Images from each coil channel were
reconstructed and combined into a single image using
a noise-weighted combination to optimize SNR.
The noise covariance matrix for a coil array is esti-
mated from a noise-only measurement collected in the
absence of any RF excitation. This acquisition lasts
about 20 seconds and provides enough thermal noise
samples to accurately estimate the noise covariance
matrix for the 30-channel coil and describes the ther-
mal noise coupling between the individual coil channel
images for unaccelerated acquisitions. The final com-
bined image is then computed as a noise-weighted sum
of the complex-valued individual coil channel images
and is given by

Diffusion-weighted data were acquired over two aver-
ages using a 3D steady-state free precession (SSFP)
sequence (TR 5 29.9 ms, a 5 608, TE5 24.96 ms, 900-

along 44 directions distributed over the unit sphere
(effective b-value 5 3,686s/mm2) (Miller et al., 2012)
with eight b 5 0 images. The two acquisitions were core-
gistered using FSL’s FLIRT to correct for B0 drift and
eddy-current distortions (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001)
and then averaged before further processing. DWI analy-
sis was done using Diffusion Toolkit (dtk), and Trackvis
was used for visualization of tracts (http://trackvis.org/)
(Wang et al., 2007). The fiber tracking algorithm is based
on the fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT)
algorithm (Mori et al., 1999). Diffusion-weighted images
were rotated to the same orientation as the MRI volume
to allow generation of plane-matched MRI and DWI
images for the atlas, and the corresponding transforma-
tion was applied to the gradient table used to acquire
the images. Tracts were created using a 608 angular
threshold, masked so tracts are only contained within
the approximate brain volume. The primary eigenvectors
of the diffusion tensor were overlaid on the fractional
anisotropy (FA) map in Freeview (part of the FreeSurfer
software package, http://freesurfer.net) to create color
FA images. Tractography images were generated in
TrackVis with a tract threshold of 20 mm and 90% skip
applied, using a Y filter to select all tracts that pass
through each coronal plane.
RESULTS
Whole-brain multimodal data generation
To obtain multimodal datasets from the same speci-
men, ex vivo MRI and DWI scans (at 7 T and 3 T,
respectively) of both hemispheres were collected (Fig.
2A,B) prior to histological processing. For anatomic
atlasing, the left hemisphere including the connected
brainstem and cerebellum (Fig. 2C) was coronally divid-
ed into 2-cm slabs, and each slab was serially sec-
tioned at 50 mm (Fig. 2D). Every fourth section (200-mm
sampling interval) was stained for Nissl substance (Fig.
2E), and every eighth section was immunostained for
NFP (400-mm interval) or PV (400-mm interval) to facili-
tate accurate delineation of the Nissl-stained sections
(Fig. 3A–C). Histological sections were imaged at cellu-
lar resolution allowing neuronal soma, dendrites, and
axons to be clearly identified (Fig. 2F). A subset of
Nissl-stained sections was selected for detailed ana-
tomical delineation with sampling density higher in
regions with greater structural complexity. This strategy
enabled adequate sampling of small but functionally
critical structures such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus
Figure 3. Examples of closely adjacent whole-hemisphere sections for the histological stains used in the atlas. A combined analysis of
Nissl-stained (A), and NFP- (B) and PV- (C) immunostained sections greatly facilitated delineation of both cortical and subcortical regions
of the human brain (see examples in Figs. 5–7). The size of a typical plate at native resolution (1 mm/pixel) is �3.0 m wide and 4.3 m
high. Scale bar 5 3,108 mm in A–C.

Creation of a unified structural brain
ontology
An essential component of modern interactive digital
atlases is a unifying hierarchical structural ontology that pro-
vides unique IDs (and colors for representation) for each
structure in a parent–child architecture. We created a
whole-brain ontology spanning all adult structures (Table 3)
and including a developmental axis for transient structures
observed during the specification and cytoarchitectural mat-
uration (Miller et al. 2014). The ontology is fundamentally
divided into the basic subdivisions of forebrain, midbrain,
and hindbrain, further divided into four major branches com-
prising gray matter, white matter, ventricles, and surface
features. For example, daughter structures of “gray matter
of forebrain” (Fig. 2G) include the telencephalon, diencepha-
lon, and transient structures of forebrain (e.g., subplate and
ventricular zone of the neocortex), while “white matter of
forebrain” includes nearly all commissural and long ipsilater-
al fiber tracts. “Ventricles of forebrain” includes the lateral
and third ventricles and related structures, while “surface
structures of forebrain” includes important gross landmark
features such as cortical gyri and sulci.
For cortical structures, we aimed to accommodate
both gyral and sulcal parcellation common to neuroim-
aging studies as well as cytoarchitectural parcellation
based on histology, for which two basic terminologies
based on Brodmann (Brodmann, 1909) and von Econ-
omo (von Economo and Koskinas, 1925; von Economo,
1927) are in usage. We used Brodmann’s nomenclature
as the primary reference because it is more commonly
used, with modifications based on modern literature
(see below) and the combined whole-brain large-scale
cyto- and chemoarchitectural analysis here. Specifically,
the following sources were used to modify the Brod-
mann scheme: for the frontal and cingulate cortex: Hof
et al. (1995a), Vogt et al. (1995), Vogt et al. (2001),
€
Ong€
ur et al. (2003), Petrides and Pandya (2012), and
Vogt and Palomero-Gallagher (2012); for parietal, tem-
poral, and occipital cortices (mostly changed to Brod-
mann’s terminology where other nomenclature was
used): Caspers et al. (2013b), Ding et al. (2009), Ding
and Van Hoesen (2010), Scheperjans et al. (2008), Van
Essen et al. (2001), Zilles and Amunts (2009), and Goe-
bel et al. (2012). The terminology for the hippocampal
formation is derived from Ding and Van Hoesen (2015)
and Ding (2013, 2015). For a few cortical areas that
Brodmann (1909) did not parcellate in detail (Simic
´ and
Hof, 2015), such as posterior parahippocampal areas
(areas
TH,
TL,
and
TF),
we
adopted
a
modified
nomenclature from von Ecomono and Koskinas (1925;
see Ding and Van Hoesen, 2010). Another example of
modification of Brodmann’s areas is the orbitofrontal
cortex, where Brodmann’s large area 11 was replaced
with smaller areas 14, 11, and 13 according to a few
modern anatomical studies in human (Hof et al., 1995a;
€
Ong€
ur et al., 2003) and our own investigation of Nissl
preparations and PV- and NFP-immunostained sections.
In addition, some of Brodmann’s areas were further
subdivided according to recent literature and the analy-
sis here. For instance, Brodmann’s areas 22 and 21
(roughly corresponding to von Economo’s areas TA and
TEd) were subdivided into rostral, intermediate, and
caudal parts based on different staining intensity in PV-
stained sections (Ding et al., 2009). Finally, for the insu-
lar cortex that was not numbered by Brodmann in
human (1909; see Simic
´ and Hof, 2015), three major
subdivisions were delineated and these included agra-
nular, dysgranular, and granular insula (e.g., Bauern-
feind et al., 2013; Morel et al., 2013), with the latter
two further divided into rostral and caudal parts.
Structures from the ontology were delineated as poly-
gons on each Nissl digital image (Fig. 2H), and these
structures include both gyral (Fig. 2I1) and modified
Brodmann areas (Fig. 2I2) of the neocortex. Together,
this comprehensive ontology covers all brain regions and
can be used interactively to browse and search delineat-
ed structure polygons. It also provides enhanced inter-
linking capabilities among a broad range of datasets
including adult (Hawrylycz et al., 2012) and developing
(Miller et al., 2014) human brain transcriptional atlases
included in the Allen Brain Atlas (www.brain-map.org).
Delineation of cortical and subcortical gray
matter
Anatomical delineation for the 106 selected plates (Fig.
2H) was based on a combined analysis of cyto- (Nissl
stain) and chemoarchitecture (NFP and PV immunohisto-
chemistry). For example, the boundaries between areas
29 and the neighboring suprasplenial subiculum (SuS)
and caudal presubiculum (PrSc; also known as the post-
subiculum [PoS]) were confidently identified based on
staining features revealed in Nissl- (Fig. 5A), and adjacent
PV- and NFP- (Fig. 5B and inset) immunostained sections.
Dark NFP and PV immunoreactivity highlights SuS and
PrSc, respectively, and these complementary and corrob-
orating data allowed a consensus digital annotation of
these regions (Fig. 5C). Similarly, in the ventral temporal
neocortex, the border between areas 36 and 20 can be
more accurately defined with PV immunostaining than
Nissl alone, as area 20 (20i) displays significantly stronger
PV immunoreactivity than area 36 (Fig. 5D,E).

 NFP immunoreactivity was in many cases more infor-
mative than Nissl stain for delineation of cortical
regions based on the selective labeling of pyramidal
neuron populations in different layers. For example,
many large pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the primary
motor cortex (M1C; Fig. 6A) are NFP-immunoreactive,
while only a small number of medium-sized neurons are
observed in that layer of the primary somatosensory
cortex (S1C; Fig. 6B). In contrast, the inferior parietal
area (rostrodorsal area 40 [area 40rd], located posterior

immunolabeling was also useful in defining many sub-
cortical regions and subdivisions such as ventroposte-
rior inferior (VPI), parafascicular (Pf), and centromedian
(CM) nuclei in the thalamus (Thal; Fig. 6D) and cranial
motor nuclei of the brainstem (Figs. 6E, 7A–C).
Localization and delineation of white matter
tracts
We also aimed for a comprehensive delineation of
white matter tracts and cranial nerves (117 total), aided
by NFP and PV fiber immunostaining. Motor roots of
the cranial nuclei in the brainstem are clearly delineat-
ed by NFP staining (Figs. 6E, G, 7A). PV immunoreactivi-
ty shows similar discernment of a variety of fiber tracts
and trajectories, such as the commissure of the inferior
colliculus (Fig. 6F) and the optic radiation (Fig. 7D,E). A
representative fully annotated atlas plate is shown in
Figure 8A, with complete cyto- and chemoarchitecture-
based parcellation and colorization superimposed on
the original Nissl image (Fig. 8C). To relate macroscopic
(landmarks) and microscopic (histology) cortical anato-
my, parallel plates were created with parcellation by
gyri and sulci (Fig. 8B) or modified Brodmann areas
(Fig. 8A). The denser sampling of subcortical regions
allowed
comprehensive
detailed
annotation
of
fine
nuclear architecture for all major regions, as illustrated
for the hypothalamus (Fig. 4) and the amygdala (Fig. 9).
Identification of novel brain subregions
In addition to confirming previously identified struc-
tures, the combination of high image resolution and
dense (200-mm-interval) Nissl sampling made it possible
to reveal or clarify a number of complex or smaller
brain structures, while the linkage to the Allen Human
Brain Atlas (Hawrylycz et al., 2012) allowed corrobora-
tion of these structures with other gene expression
data. One example is in the mediodorsal nucleus (MD)
of the thalamus, where we observed a group of densely
packed larger cells between the paraventricular nucleus
(PaV) and the main portion of the MD, which we named
the anteromedial subdivision of the MD (MDam in Fig.
10A). In situ hybridization data of both acetylcholines-
terase (ACHE) and neurotensin (NTS) supports this par-
tition, as they are selectively enriched in this region
compared with the main part of the MD (Fig. 10B and
inset). Similarly, we identified a novel subdivision of the
basomedial
nucleus
(BM)
of
the
amygdala.

subdivisions of the BM (BMD and BMV) and was termed
BMm (medial subdivision of BM; Fig. 10C and inset).
The BMm displays enriched cellular expression of the
g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunit E (GABRE)
compared with the neighboring BMD and BMV (Fig.

cies have not been reported.
Another new area was identified running along the
side of lateral olfactory stria, situated medially to the
piriform cortex (Pir) and laterally to the substantia inno-
minata (SI). This was termed the lateral olfactory area
(LOA) and was found to have distinct histological fea-
tures
from
the
neighboring
Pir
and
SI
(Fig.
11).
Compared with the Pir, the LOA does not have a dark,
densely packed layer 2 on Nissl stain and has much
stronger NFP immunoreactivity. In Nissl-stained materi-
als, the SI contains many cellular patches of differing
sizes, packing densities, and staining intensities, with
cells of contrasting shapes and sizes, compared with

layer 2 (A). LOA does not have these characteristic features, but shows cell patches that are different from those in SI (A). In NFP-
immunostained sections, Pir is very light throughout while LOA shows strong labeling in the superficial layer (B). Only the large-celled patch

only the largest neurons are labeled (Fig. 11B). The SI
does not display laminar organization, while the LOA
has a clear but discontinuous layer 2 and one deep lay-
er. In contrast, the Pir has a dark and continuous layer
2 and a less darkly stained layer 3.
Two other structures described previously only in
non-human primates were identified as well, such as
area prostriata (APro) and the basal interstitial nucleus
of the cerebellum (BIcb). APro is a region located at the
junction of the retrosplenial, post- and parasubiculum,
posterior cingulate, and anterior–dorsal primary visual
cortices. It has been described in detail in macaque
monkey (Morecraft et al., 2000; Ding et al., 2003) and
is important for fast procession of peripheral vision (Yu
et al., 2012). Although its existence in the human brain
was briefly described, its exact location and extent has
not been reported in detail so far. Our mapping indi-
cates that APro is much larger in human (Fig. 12) than
in macaque monkey (Ding et al., 2003). The BIcb in the
human brain is located deep to the medial interpositus
nucleus (InPM; globose nucleus) of the cerebellum and
consists of scattered large NFP-immunoractive neurons
(Fig. 13).
Identifying anatomical landmarks in MRI
data
Transposing the Nissl-based anatomical delineations
into full 3D annotations registered to the accompany-
ing MRI volume is challenging due to the incomplete
and
nonuniform
sampling
of
those
annotations.
However, individual Nissl plates can be matched to
corresponding planes of the MRI data to allow the
identification of features of specific structures that
can then be mapped onto MRI data from other brains
without accompanying architecture-based delineations.
The utility of this approach can be demonstrated in
the case of the medial geniculate nucleus (MG) and
the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG). A compari-
son of the architecture-based atlas (Fig. 14A) and the
corresponding MRI plate (Fig. 14B) from the same
brain shows that the MG has high and the DLG low
signal intensity. Combining these features with basic
spatial topography, the MG and DLG in the MRI scans
from other brains from the Allen Human Brain Atlas
(Hawrylycz et al., 2012) are clearly discerned (Fig.
14C,D). The MG is so similar in signal intensity to the
adjoining white matter (consistently high signal intensi-
ty in T1-weighted images) that it would probably be
misidentified as white matter if the extracted feature
(i.e., high signal intensity) was not used. With the
topography of the histology-based parcellation as a
guide, many fine structures can be similarly identified
in MRI data that would otherwise be difficult to identi-
fy and discriminate, thus extending the value of this
single brain atlas to the interpretation of neuroimaging
data (Fig. 15).

corresponding MRI and DWI
The complete set of histology-based atlas plates is pre-
sented in Figures 16 and 17. These include a plate loca-

nucleus (i.e., the medial interpositus nucleus [InPM in A]). In Nissl
stain, the cells in the BIcb are large and darkly stained (B). In
NFP stain, these large cells are positively stained (C,D; C is the

plates (Fig. 17). To translate the atlas structural delinea-
tions onto the MRI dataset, a set of 76 coronal MRI slices
at 2-mm intervals (Fig. 18) from the same hemisphere
was selected and annotated (Fig. 19, left column).
Macroscopic landmarks such as cortical sulci and gyri
were used as guides to match histological and MRI planes
of section, and local topography was used (e.g. see Figs.
14, 15) to label identifiable structures including all neo-
cortical areas and major subcortical regions.
Some well-known white matter tracts such as the optic
radiation (“or” in Fig. 19, levels 42–69) and auditory radia-
tion (“ar”) are clearly visible in the 7 T MRI images and
can be clearly followed for a long distance due to their
darker appearance than the surrounding white matter.
Interestingly, a corresponding part of the somatosensory
radiation (named here the “sr”) is also clearly visible (Fig.
19, levels 38–46). The “sr” is normally treated as part of
the superior radiation in the literature and mainly origi-
nates from the ventroposterior lateral nucleus of the

 thalamus and targets the primary somatosensory cortex.
In this 7 T MRI dataset, like the “or” and “ar,” the “sr” is
observed to stand out from surrounding white matter and
thus deserves an independent term (i.e., somatosensory
radiation) as do optic and auditory radiations.
Finally, color-coded orientation maps and tractography
maps of both hemispheres from the same brain are also
available and are presented in Figure 19 (right column).
By comparison with the accompanying MRI plates, some
white matter fiber tracts can be identified. For example,
at level 40 of Figure 19, the callosal and cingulate bun-
dles, superior longitudinal fasciculus (slf-m, slf-I, and slf-
l), and somatosensory radiation can be easily localized
with the guide of the annotated MRI atlas.
For convenience Figures 16-19 are presented, togeth-
er with Table 3, after the literature list at the end of
the paper.
DISCUSSION
Brain reference atlases are essential resources for
neuroscience research, serving to identify and annotate
the complex anatomical architecture of the brain and
allow communication across laboratories and various
research disciplines attempting to link structure to
function (Fischl et al., 1999; Toga et al., 2006; Amunts
et al., 2007; Evans et al., 2012). Ideally, modern digital
atlases
should
comprise
3D
reference
frameworks
with comprehensive anatomical coverage and cellular
resolution cyto- and chemoarchitectural histology-based
structural annotation using hierarchical ontologies, and
correlated histological and neuroimaging data (Toga
et al., 2006; Destrieux et al., 2010; Evans et al., 2012;
Caspers et al., 2013a). All currently available human
brain reference atlases lack some of these features

resolution imaging. Most importantly, the atlas is com-
prehensively annotated using a unified hierarchical
structural ontology based on combined cyto- and che-
moarchitectural parcellation of 862 gray matter and
white matter structures. A freely accessible online atlas
browser was created to allow easy visualization and
navigation, and the resource is integrated with other
human brain cellular resolution gene expression and
transcriptomic atlases (Hawrylycz et al., 2012; Miller
et al., 2014).
Parcellation of the human neocortex presents a par-
ticular challenge, as several different schemes based
on cortical gyri and sulci or histological delineation are
in common usage (Brodmann, 1909; Talairach and Tour-
noux, 1988; Fischl et al., 2004; Duvernoy, 1999; Dama-
sio, 2005; Mai et al., 2008; Destrieux et al., 2010;
Petrides, 2012), and the relationship between cortical
geometry and architectonic identity is variable across
the cortex (Fischl et al., 2008). To serve both communi-
ties, we chose to perform multiple annotations of the
same dataset. The first is based on macroscopic anno-
tation of gyri and sulci, while the second is based on
microscopic analysis of combined cyto- and chemoarch-
itectural data to create a modified Brodmann parcella-
tion. This unique human dataset of interleaved Nissl
staining, and NFP and PV immunolabeling in a whole
hemisphere, allowed a complete parcellation based on
variations in overall cell density, NFP immunolabeling of
subsets of long-range excitatory projection neurons,
and PV-expressing neurons and neuropil. In many cases
this parcellation agrees with those generated using oth-
er techniques such as receptor autoradiography and
Nissl-based gray-level indices (Zilles and Amunts, 2009;
Amunts et al., 2010; Vogt et al., 2013). For example,
the inferior parietal lobule has been consistently divided
into three basic regions based on cellular and receptor
architecture (Caspers et al., 2013b), and our analysis of
cyto- and chemoarchitecture corroborates this tripartite
delineation (albeit with a different nomenclature). In
many other cases these data allowed a detailed parcel-
lation of regions that had not yet been examined in
detail by others, such as the area prostriata and other
structures described above. In principle, this dataset
could be reannotated by other researchers to provide
alternate interpretations. Finally, this dataset could be
aligned
to
new
functional
parcellations
based
on
neuroimaging data, such as a recent analyses from the
Human Brainnetome Atlas (Fan et al., 2016) and the
Human Connectome Project (www.humanconnectome.
org; Glasser et al., 2016), opening up new possibilities
for linking cytoarchitecture and function at microscopic
and macroscopic scales.
There is a fundamental schism between probabilistic
reference atlases used in neuroimaging (Hammers et al.,
2003; Ahsan et al., 2007; Scheperjans et al., 2008; Shat-
tuck et al., 2008; Diedrichsen et al., 2009; Kuklisova-
Murgasova et al., 2011), based on thousands of individu-
als, and detailed histological reference atlases based on
exhaustive analysis and annotation of single representa-
tive brain specimens (Brodmann, 1909; von Economo
and Koskinas, 1925; Sarkisov et al., 1955). It is not cur-
rently possible to analyze large numbers of whole brains
histologically and thus build a probabilistic histological
atlas, although strong efforts are under way to move in
the direction of generating probabilistic histological refer-
ence atlases using standard histological (JuBrain; Cas-
pers et al., 2013a) as well as novel imaging techniques
(Magnain et al., 2014, 2015; Wang et al., 2014; Zilles
et al., 2016). Furthermore, human brains exhibit a
remarkable amount of interindividual variability, particu-
larly in the gyri and sulci of the cerebral cortex (Maz-
ziotta et al., 2001; Uylings et al., 2005; Toga et al.,
2006; Amunts et al., 2007; Ding and Van Hoesen, 2010;
Zilles and Amunts, 2010, 2013). For instance, one brain
may have area 35 located in the medial bank of a deep
collateral sulcus (CoS), while another may have its area
35 in the lateral bank of a shallow CoS, or even the
crown of the anterior fusiform gyrus (Ding and Van Hoe-
sen, 2010). Thus it is not realistically meaningful to map
histological annotations from a single specimen directly
into a probabilistic reference space, even with advances
in techniques for deformable registration. On the other
hand, the current generation of both MRI and DWI data
in the same specimen as the histological data allows the
direct correlation of cytoarchitectural features with MRI
features or landmarks. As we demonstrate, this dataset
may thus allow feature extraction that can be applied to
other brains to identify fine anatomical structures not
otherwise identifiable, especially when higher resolution
imaging techniques such as 9.4-Tesla MRI, optical
coherence tomography, and polarized light microscopy
become available (Fatterpekar et al., 2002; Magnain
et al., 2015; Zilles et al., 2016).
In summary, we have created a cellular resolution,
comprehensively annotated atlas for an entire adult
human brain hemisphere (Fig. 17) based on a combined

 analysis of cyto- and chemoarchitectures and modern lit-
erature. This combination of anatomic completeness, mul-
timodal histological cellular-resolution imaging, modified
Brodmann’s areas delineations in neocortex, neuroimag-
ing (Fig. 19), and intuitive digital interactivity provides an
advance over other current large-scale human brain
atlases. This versatile and publicly accessible resource
gives a range of users a means to learn, teach, and inves-
tigate human brain structure and function, including the
diagnosis and treatment of brain disease.

Figure 16. Anteroposterior position of the 106 annotated plates shown in Figure 17. Major macroscopic landmarks (sulci and gyri) on the
medial aspect of the left hemisphere are indicated (flipped to show the plate levels (plates 1–106) in an anterior-to-posterior order).
General locations of slabs 1–8 were also marked at the top. Note that in slabs 4–7, only the alternative plates were indicated, to avoid
busy lines. For abbreviations see Table 3. Scale bar 5 2 cm.
Figure 17. Human brain atlas plates. 106 plates with matching histological sections are displayed in anterior-to-posterior (A-P) order. The
matching histological images include 50 Nissl-stained, and 50 NFP- and 6 PV-immunostained sections. The 106 plate images, correspond-
ing to the A-P positions delineated in Figure 16, combine the cortical annotation of modified Brodmann areas and traditional gyri and sulci.
At each level, a color-coded atlas plate (“a” series; 1a–106a) and a histological image (“b” series; 1b–106b) are presented. The inset dia-
gram at the top right corner of each atlas plate shows the A-P position (red line) of that plate on a schematic representation of the whole
hemisphere based on MRI. The green lettering along the cortical surface indicates cortical sulci (lower case, often with black arrowheads)
and gyri (upper case), which were generally defined by adjacent sulci. Modified Brodmann areas were labeled within the cortical gray mat-
ter with differential color coding. In plates containing cerebellar cortex, alternative plates were annotated for three cerebellar cortical
zones (vermis, paravermis, and lateral hemisphere) and 10 lobules (lobules I–X), respectively. Other subcortical structures were also
labeled with differential color coding. The general locations of most white matter tracts are indicated by a circled “W”. Fiber tracts with
clear boundaries, such as ac, mtt, ot, sste/or, fx, fr, scp, py, and ml, were outlined by black lines without color code (white). The parcella-
tion and subdivisions of different brain regions as well as the parent–daughter relationship and abbreviation of each structure are detailed
in Table 3. Note that two separate versions of this atlas for modified Brodmann areas and traditional gyri and sulci, respectively, are avail-
able in the online version of this atlas (www.brainspan.org or http://brainspan.org/static/atlas). For abbreviations see Table 3. Scale
bar 5 5 mm (at levels 1b–106b).

 Figure 19. MRI and DWI plates from the same brain. Left column: Seventy-six sequential 7T MRI slices from the same left hemisphere as
the atlas shown in Figure 17 were annotated according to the atlas plates in Figure 17. The interval between each slice is 2 mm. The MRI
images were annotated for easily predicted and/or identified structures through correspondence to the annotated histological atlas.
Several clearly delineated fiber tracts are annotated as well, including the optic radiation (“or” at levels 42–69) and somatosensory radia-
tion (‘sr” at levels 38–46). For abbreviations see Table 3. Right column: Top panel shows colorized fractional anisotropy (FA) maps of the
corresponding plane of section in the DWI dataset, representing the primary eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor data overlaid on the FA
map. Bottom panel shows tractography images created in TrackVis showing all tracts passing through the represented plane of section
(90% of tracts omitted with only tracts longer than 20 mm displayed). Scale bars 5 5 mm.
Figure 18. Gross anatomy of the left hemisphere and anteroposterior position of the 76 annotated MRI images shown in Figure 19. Main
macroscopic landmarks (sulci and gyri) on dorsal (A), lateral (B), and ventral (C) aspects of the left hemisphere are indicated. The A-P
locations (levels 1–76) of the 76 MRI images are marked with black lines 1–76 in B. * and # indicate two corresponding regions. For
abbreviations see Table 3. Scale bar 5 2 cm in A (applies to A–C).
