Abstract
Objective: This article outlines the consensus guidelines for symptomatic treatment for children with Pediatric Acute-Onset
Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) and Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Syndrome Associated with Streptococcal
Infection (PANDAS).
Methods: Extant literature on behavioral, psychotherapeutic, and psychopharmacologic treatments for PANS and PANDAS
was reviewed. Members of the PANS Research Consortium pooled their clinical experiences to find agreement on treatment
of PANS and PANDAS symptoms.
Results: Current guidelines result from consensus among the Consortium members.
Conclusion: While underlying infectious and inflammatory processes in PANS and PANDAS patients are treated,
psychiatric and behavioral symptoms need simultaneous treatment to decrease suffering and improve adherence to
therapeutic intervention. Psychological, behavioral, and psychopharmacologic interventions tailored to each child’s
presentation can provide symptom improvement and improve functioning during both the acute and chronic stages of
illness. In general, typical evidence-based interventions are appropriate for the varied symptoms of PANS and PANDAS.
Individual differences in expected response to psychotropic medication may require marked reduction of initial treat-
ment dose. Antimicrobials and immunomodulatory therapies may be indicated, as discussed in Parts 2 and 3 of this
guideline series.

Psychiatric and Behavioral Interventions
P
ediatricAcute-onsetNeuropsychiatricSyndrome(PANS)
is defined by the foudroyant (lightning-like) onset of obsessive–
compulsive disorder (OCD) or eating restrictions and comorbid
symptoms from at least two of seven categories: anxiety (par-
ticularly separation anxiety); emotional lability or depression;
irritability, aggression, and/or severely oppositional behaviors;
deterioration in school performance [related to attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors, memory deficits,
and cognitive changes]; sensory or motor abnormalities; and so-
matic signs and symptoms, including sleep disturbances, enuresis,
or urinary frequency (Swedo et al. 2012; Chang et al. 2015). Acute-
onset cases that are triggered by Group A streptococcal infections
may meet diagnostic criteria for both PANS and Pediatric Auto-
immune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal

 infections (PANDAS) (Swedo et al. 1998). As these two syndromes
display highly similar symptoms, these guidelines will treat them as
a single entity: PANS/PANDAS.
Directly controlling or minimizing symptoms of PANS/PANDAS
is essential to decrease suffering, increase the child’s ability to
receive other important treatments, and overall recovery. As is true
in treatment of delirium, the instigating processes (which include
infections and inflammatory diseases) and symptoms of PANS/
PANDAS must be addressed simultaneously. Early research in
other types of brain injury, including concussion, stroke, and
multiple sclerosis, suggest that neural plasticity depends on use and
that early rehabilitation has better outcome, supporting the prompt
initiation of psychotherapy (Liguez-Lecznar 2013; Prosperini 2015;
Turner-Stokes et al. 2015; Ellis 2016). Psychological and behav-
ioral interventions and psychopharmacologic treatment can im-
prove symptoms and decrease impairments during both the acute
and chronic stages of illness. Therefore, psychiatric and behavioral
interventions should begin as soon as PANS/PANDAS is identified.
Individualizing Treatment
Since symptom presentations differ, therapies should be tailored
to meet each child’s specific needs. For example, mildly distressed
children may not require pharmacological intervention. In more se-
vere cases, education and support are augmented by symptom-
specific behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. The therapeutic
interventions may require periodic adjustments, as the PANS/PAN-
DAS symptoms frequently change during the course of illness, such
as moving from severe anxiety to aggression or from emotional la-
bility to depression. Antibiotic and immune-based treatments often
have dramatic effects, reducing symptoms to a tolerable level or
eliminating them completely. In other cases, the treatments fail or a
new symptom exacerbation occurs before the child has returned
to baseline, resulting in even greater distress and impairment. Given
the variability in the course of PANS/PANDAS, clinicians should
be cautious about ‘‘chasing’’ the illness by reacting to temporary
symptom exacerbations or increasing medication dosages before
maximum benefits of the drug and other medical interventions have
been realized. The following recommendations are based on the
authors’ extensive clinical experience and are intended to serve as
guidelines for minimizing distress and dysfunction of affected chil-
dren. Education, supportive and behavioral therapies, and psycho-
active medications are the mainstays of symptomatic treatment for
PANS/PANDAS. Antimicrobials and immunomodulatory therapies
also may be indicated, as discussed in Parts 2 and 3 of this series
(Brown et al. 2017; Cooperstock et al. 2017).
Safety
A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation should be the first step
in the treatment of children with PANS/PANDAS, as described
in Chang et al. (2015). When taking the child’s history, particular
attention should be paid to symptoms that pose a risk to the child
or his family, such as impulsivity, physical violence or aggres-
sion, refusal to eat or drink, and suicidality; if found, they should
be immediately addressed with appropriate environmental, edu-
cational, and pharmacological measures. Crisis management in
PANS/PANDAS is similar to that of other disorders presenting risk
of self-harm (AACAP 2012).
Inpatient hospitalization may be required to contain and address
dangerous behaviors or if the patient needs closer medical monitoring
while starting psychiatric medications (e.g., borderline QTc, or de-
hydration secondary to restricted oral intake). Ideally, the child would
be hospitalized on a pediatric behavioral unit staffed by personnel
comfortable with medical procedures and interventions and experi-
enced in the use of behavior modification techniques and containment
of aggressive or self-harming behavior. In addition, the unit would
allow parents to remain at the child’s bedside throughout the stay,
since separation anxiety is present in more than 90% of patients. Such
units are rare, and clinicians often must decide between a general
pediatrics ward and a pediatric psychiatric unit. While pediatric units
allow parents to room-in with the child and offer more expertise in
medical procedures and invasive interventions, they are often ill-
equipped to deal with the problematic behaviors of PANS/PANDAS,
such as severe agitation, physical combativeness, and compulsive
rituals (e.g., refusal to wear clothing). Furthermore, medical units
are often overly bright, noisy, and filled with interruptions, which
aggravate the sensory sensitivities of children with PANS/PANDAS.
In contrast, while child psychiatric units have established protocols for
dealing with disruptive or dangerous behaviors, the psychiatric nurs-
ing staff may have little experience with invasive procedures and
treatments, such as lumbar puncture or administration of intravenous
immunoglobulin. In such cases, the child might be transferred to the
general pediatrics unit accompanied by staff from the psychiatric unit
or, if necessary, to an intensive care unit where the procedures can be
performed under sedation. In rare cases, admission to an intensive care
unit may be indicated to address life-threatening dehydration and
malnutrition due to food refusal (Toufexis et al. 2015).
The majority of children with PANS/PANDAS require some type
of school accommodation. Anxieties, OCD symptoms, tics, frequent
urination, attention-deficit disorder symptoms, handwriting diffi-
culties, poor cognitive and physical stamina, difficulties with math
and processing speed, memory issues, pain, and frequent absences
each cause trouble and, in combination, create great challenges to the
children and their teachers. Many schools have scarce resources, so
persistence, assertiveness, and creativity in the school and family
will yield better outcomes. A Student Study Team meeting to arrange
for the implementation of either a 504 plan (Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act) or individualized educational plan (IEP) may be
of significant benefit to the child (U.S. Department of Education).
The IEP should provide specific individually tailored accommoda-
tions that will help the child with PANS/PANDAS attend and benefit
from school. Legally, the 504 or IEP must be periodically reviewed,
usually annually. PANS children’s needs change day to day and
month to month. Writing the plans with the most difficult days
in mind will assure that the child can receive adequate accommo-
dations without revisiting the 504 or IEP process often. Typical
accommodations during flares of illness might include the following:
General—Excusing the child’s absences and not requiring makeup
assignments or tests.
Separation anxiety—allowing a parent to be in or near the
classroom (perhaps helping out).
OCD symptoms—excusing the child from certain activities, al-
lowing him to complete assignments using alternate methods (e.g.,
typing homework, rather than erasing and rewriting repeatedly;
listening to audio books, rather than reading and rereading).
Urinary urgency/frequency—leaving the class without asking
permission.
Dysgraphia or handwriting difficulties—having a note-taker
in class, dictating tests and homework, enlarging worksheets,
writing on large grid paper, and using a keyboard, voice-
recognition software, or audio recorder.
Dyscalculia and math difficulties—using a calculator or times
table and working with a resource teacher or tutor.

 Slowed processing speed—decreasing the number and length
of assignments, allowing extra time for tests and in-class as-
signments, and giving directions in written and oral form, and
Poor physical and cognitive stamina, pain—shorter school day
with reduced academic load, less homework, rest periods dur-
ing the day (perhaps in the nurse’s office), and omitting or
adapting physical education requirements.
When acute exacerbations of PANS/PANDAS symptoms have
abated, these accommodations should be re-evaluated. Attending
school and doing school work may be part of an appropriate psy-
chotherapeutic plan. As the child’s function improves, the accom-
modations can be peeled back as symptoms improve and to align
with therapeutic goals.
Family Support and Education
The emotional and behavioral symptoms of PANS/PANDAS can
stress patients and their families. Often one parent must stay home
from work to provide round-the-clock care for the child with PANS/
PANDAS. In addition to providing comfort and care, the parents
must also find and coordinate medical care and interact with schools
to secure necessary accommodations (and care for siblings).
Clinicians should ensure that families understand the clinical
course of PANS/PANDAS, including its unpredictably episodic
pattern. In severe cases, it is not uncommon for a child to insist on
obsessive compulsive rituals, to resist any separation from his parent
at all, or to become enraged at without apparent provocation. At such
times, interventions should be aimed at keeping the child safe until
the anxiety or rage subsides. Minimizing transitions and numbers of
activities, providing rest times, decreasing noxious sensory stimuli,
and removing objects that might hurt the child or others may help to
decrease the number and severity of ‘‘meltdowns.’’ Once the episode
has subsided, parents should be encouraged to resume their normally
effective parenting strategies, including setting necessary limits, re-
inforcing desirable behaviors, and ignoring or punishing unwanted
behaviors by removing privileges. Often, the affected child can help
parents to distinguish undesirable behaviors requiring intervention
from those that are an unfortunate manifestation of his PANS/
PANDAS symptomatology (Motluck 2013).
Parents, themselves, suffer with the burden of caring for their
PANS/PANDAS afflicted children. Many report feeling trauma-
tized by the sometimes lengthy course of seeking medical care and
from seeing their child ill; they often live fearing relapse. National
and regional support networks have formed, which may be helpful
to address this trauma and skills groups for PANS/PANDAS, par-
ents are also being piloted.
Behavioral and Pharmacological Interventions
for PANS/PANDAS
Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) (specifically exposure/response
prevention [ERP]) and minimizing family accommodation to OCD
behaviors have been repeatedly shown to be among the most
effective interventions for pediatric OCD (OCD 2004, Lebowitz
et al. 2011). While large-scale studies of these interventions in
PANS/PANDAS have not been conducted, pilot studies suggest
behavioral therapies are still highly effective in treating the OCD
symptoms of children with PANS/PANDAS (Storch et al. 2006).
Treatment with CBT/ERP should be initiated as soon as possible to
maximize benefits. During the acute phase of illness, the child may
not be ready to fully participate in CBT because of overwhelming
OCD or anxiety, sensory sensitivities, emotional lability, and/or
cognitive impairments. However, it is helpful when parents learn
strategies to ‘‘hold the line’’ and prevent symptoms from further
worsening through their inadvertent accommodation to the child’s
irrational fears (March et al. 1998; Lebowitz et al. 2011, 2014;
Motluck 2013; Sukhodolsky et al. 2013). Understanding and ap-
plying CBT and ERP strategies will decrease distress and inter-
ference from symptoms in the short term and can provide tools that
can be used life-long to manage OCD, anxiety, and life stressors.
Psychoactive medications can also be quite helpful in the man-
agement of PANS/PANDAS symptoms. Although controlled trials
have not been done, clinical experience suggests that anxiety, OCD,
and other symptoms of PANS/PANDAS respond to the same medi-
cations used to treat the symptoms in non-PANS/PANDAS cases.
However, the PANS/PANDAS clinical presentations are often more
complex, with multiple symptom targets presenting simultaneously.
Furthermore, the episodic symptom course can make it difficult to
discern responses to pharmacologic interventions that require days or
weeks of administration before benefits are realized from the inde-
pendent relapses and remittances of PANS/PANDAS symptoms.
Some experienced clinicians report that PANS/PANDAS patients
appear to be more sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic med-
ications, including agitation, dystonia, or catatonia, but no controlled
studies speak to these anecdotal reports. Thus, clinicians are advised
to ‘‘start low and go slow’’ in prescribing these medications—be-
ginning with dosages ¼ (or less) of typical and using an extended
upward titer. Benzodiazepines may be a good first treatment for
PANS/PANDAS, as they may address the child’s anxiety, agitation,
aggression, insomnia, and other symptoms. Clinicians and parents
should be aware that pediatric patients may experience severe dis-
inhibition when treated with benzodiazepines, although the medica-
tions are otherwise well tolerated in youth with PANS/PANDAS.
Management of Specific PANS/PANDAS Symptoms
Obsessive compulsive (OCD) symptoms
In general, management of obsessions and compulsions follows
the usual standard of care for pediatric OCD (Geller and March
2012). Evidence-based therapies include CBT, parent manage-
ment training, and medications. A small study of intensive CBT
with family involvement found that OCD symptoms improved in
PANDAS patients during the current episode and benefits carried
over to subsequent flares (Storch et al. 2006). Applying parent
management techniques (PMT), which include encouraging fami-
lies to not participate in behaviors accommodating the child’s
avoidance and rituals, positively reinforcing desired behaviors,
setting clear limits, expectations, and consequences, and estab-
lishing reward systems, will likely improve symptoms and child
compliance. PMT are particularly useful when PANS patients are
not ready or willing to use CBT themselves (Lebowitz et al. 2014).
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the preferred
medication for treatment of OCD in PANS, based on multiple
placebo-controlled clinical trials (Geller 2003; Grados and Riddle
2001; Pediatric OCD Treatment Study Team 2004, 2011) (Gabbay
and Coffey 2003; Coffey and Wieland 2007). Fluoxetine, sertra-
line, fluvoxamine, and clomipramine are Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) approved for treating pediatric OCD and have the
most evidence to support their use (ibid). Clinical experience
suggests both that SSRI’s may be helpful and that using a low dose
and slow titration minimizes the risk of side effects. Upward ti-
trations should be adjusted no faster than 2-week intervals. Fre-
quent monitoring is recommended to ensure that side effects are not
becoming troublesome. In one, 14 of 38 children with PANDAS
568
THIENEMANN ET AL.
 experienced behavioral activation when treated with an SSRI;
symptoms included hyperactivity, mania, disinhibited behavior,
worsening OCD behavior, aggression, irritability, agitation, and
suicidality (Murphy et al. 2006). In one boy with PANS, when
5 mg/day of fluoxetine was discontinued, suicidal behaviors ceased
and he was able to tolerate 2 mg/day of fluoxetine when the med-
ication was reintroduced (Murphy et al. 2006). SSRI side effects
can match symptoms one is trying to relieve, so careful attention to
the relationship of medication dose and timing of symptom change,
along with monitoring the course of underlying PANS itself, is
necessary to optimize SSRI treatment.
Antipsychotic medications, such as risperidone (0.125–1 mg) or
aripiprazole (0.5–2.0 mg), should be reserved for incapacitating
OCD. An electrocardiogram (EKG) should be obtained before and
during treatment with antipsychotics to monitor the QTc interval—
excessive prolongation (QTc >450 mseconds) is a contraindication
to use of antipsychotic medications.
Restriction of food or fluid intake
The sudden onset of reduced and restricted food intake fulfills
the first criterion for PANS, even in the absence of more typical
OCD symptoms (Swedo et al. 2012; Toufexis et al. 2015). Medical
evaluation should be done to rule out other medical disorders (e.g.,
eosinophilic esophagitis, structural or neurological causes of dys-
phagia, and nausea) and assess for medical instability related to
restricted intake of food and/or fluids. For those with severely
limited oral intake, assessment should include checking orthostatic
vital signs, EKG, and electrolytes, including phosphorus and
magnesium and monitoring for refeeding syndrome. Hospitaliza-
tion may be required for children who are medically unstable be-
cause of restricted intake of food and/or fluids (Chang et al. 2015;
Golden et al. 2015).
In treating children with intake disturbances related to PANS,
the focus should be on maintaining adequate nutrition and hydra-
tion while treating underlying brain inflammation. Feeding tubes
may be necessary, at least during the acute phases of the illness. The
severity and duration of the eating disturbances can vary. For ex-
ample, in four reported cases of infection-triggered anorexia ner-
vosa, treatment with antibiotics improved symptoms remarkably
(Sokol 2000). However, many PANS patients experience ongoing
eating abnormalities and require interventions used in other eating
disorder treatments to directly target other factors contributing to
the eating restrictions (Lock 2015).
For patients with high anxiety and compulsive behaviors, an
exposure and response prevention approach may prove helpful.
This involves gradual exposure to foods or situations that cause
anxiety or fear, within a support framework that encourages in-
cremental progress toward expanding diet and increasing intake.
Occupational therapy interventions that include targeting posture,
breathing, and relaxation may be helpful adjuncts, especially for
patients who fear of choking or vomiting. When the problems with
eating involve obsessions or compulsions, a psychopharmacolog-
ical approach similar to that used for OCD may help. However, in
cases of significant malnutrition, medication may not help until the
child has restored weight, and malnourished patients may be at
increased risk of adverse side effects.
Tics
Based on preliminary studies, as many as 70% of PANS/
PANDAS patients either present with or develop tics (Murphy et al.
2015; Swedo et al. 2015). PANS patients with tics have been re-
ported to be more severely affected at home and at school, with
poorer school performance, handwriting, visual-spatial memory,
and self-esteem (Murphy et al. 2015). Some PANS/PANDAS pa-
tients’ tics first present with complex motor and vocal tics, rather
than presenting with a progression from simple tics to complex
motor and phonic tics that is typical of Tourette syndrome (Tucker
et al. 1996).
In most cases, tics are not considered a treatment target unless
they cause pain, significant interference in function, or create un-
resolvable embarrassment or teasing. Comprehensive behavioral
intervention for tics (CBIT), habit reversal training (HRT), and
cautious monitored pharmacotherapy are the treatments of choice
(Piacentini et al. 2010; Murphy et al. 2013). In HRT, children learn
to be aware of their tics and their antecedent premonitory urge.
They help design a ‘‘competing response,’’ which is a motor be-
havior that makes doing the tic impossible. When children practice
this, resisting or suppressing the tic, as in response prevention for
OCD, they stop reinforcing the urge and the urge frequency di-
minishes. Examples of competing responses include staring or
looking up to extinguish a blinking tic and slow, rhythmic dia-
phragmatic breathing for vocal tics. Relaxation training, analyzing,
and addressing situations that worsen tics and family reinforcement
of applying HRT strategies comprise other elements of CBITC.
Exposure with Response Prevention may also be effective inter-
vention for severe tics (Wile and Pringsheim 2013).
Many clinicians consider the alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, clo-
nidine, and guanfacine to be the first-line pharmacologic inter-
vention for tics. However, a recent meta-analysis has suggested that
alpha-2 agonists may have minimal benefit in tic patients without
ADHD (Weisman et al. 2013). Antipsychotics may be indicated for
severe tics, although their use should be restricted for as short a
duration as necessary. Haloperidol, pimozide, and aripiprazole
have FDA approval for the treatment of Tourette Syndrome. Of the
atypical antipsychotics, risperidone also has evidence supporting
its use for the treatment of tics, but does not have an FDA indication
(Budman 2014). In addition, a recent meta-analysis of the available
scientific literature found no significant difference in the efficacy of
four antipsychotic agents evaluated (risperidone, pimozide, halo-
peridol, and ziprasidone) (Weisman et al. 2013). As described
above, an EKG should be obtained before, and during, treatment
with antipsychotic medications to rule out a prolonged QTc.
Irritability and aggression
Irritability, aggression, and unprovoked violent behaviors are
among the most troubling symptoms of PANS. Parents frequently
report mood lability and impulsive aggression in children with
PANS/PANDS. Sensory sensitivities, irritability, fatigue, anxiety,
and cognitive changes may cause the child to adapt poorly to en-
vironmental changes, making them vulnerable to aggressive be-
haviors. The episodes may last for 45–60 minutes or longer, but
within a few minutes of the rage subsiding, the child is ‘‘back’’ and
expresses remorse for his tantrum, often not knowing or remem-
bering why they behaved as they did.
Environmental interventions may decrease the frequency of
aggressive behavior. Modulating stimulation, minimizing de-
mands, and promoting adequate nutrition and sleep may each
help. In the moment, distraction may be one of the most effective
tools, for example, the use of favorite toys (that are unlikely to be
used as weapons), singing, dancing, television, food, crying, and
acting silly may re-engage the child’s ‘‘cortex’’ and truncate the
episode. Designing a home plan for calling for help and remaining
PANS CONSENSUS GUIDELINES PSYCHIATRIC/BEHAVIORAL
569
 nonpunitive with the child is important. Although calling 911 may
seem like an extreme solution to a child’s behavior, it is sometimes
necessary in order for the parents to protect themselves and their
children from harm, to reassure children that their behavior can
be contained, and to not undermine established behavior plans. If
rages are frequent, it may be worthwhile to educate local police
officers about the nature of the illness, as, understandably, police
might misinterpret rageful episodes as acting-out behavior.
For irritability related to anxiety, benzodiazepines may be the
safest and most effective psychotropic with which to begin treat-
ment. Antipsychotic medications or mood stabilizers have been
shown to reduce the frequency and intensity of aggressive behav-
iors. Despite their associated adverse effects, they may be indicated
for children whose aggressive behavior risks harming themselves
or others. The medications may be prescribed on an as-needed basis
(if possible to administer then) or on a regular schedule. Risper-
idone and aripiprazole are FDA approved for treating irritability in
autistic children.
For patients with aggression secondary to encephalitis, helpful
interventions have included the following:
� Diphenhydramine in doses from 12.5 to 50 mg. Side effects
include paradoxical excitation or confusion. May be given
orally, intramuscularly (IM), or IV.
� Benzodiazepines: Lorazepam at doses beginning at 0.5 mg.
Also can cause agitation and disinhibition. May be given
orally, IM, or IV.
� Antipsychotics: Risperidone, aripiprazole, or haloperidol may
be helpful for children with aggression and rage. Haloperidol
is started at 0.025 mg/kg/day in divided doses going up to a
maximum of 0.05 mg/kg/day in divided doses (compared with
the typical starting dose of 0.5 mg for larger children and ad-
olescents). May be given orally, IM, or IV. When given orally
or IM, it should be given with diphenhydramine. Due to the
risk of drug effects and drug–drug interactions, an EKG must
be checked for QTc prolongation when using antipsychotics.
Anxiety
Separation anxiety frequently interferes with PANS children’s
comfort and family function, restricting both the child’s and par-
ent’s activity. Fortunately, with treatment of the underlying causes
of PANS, the suffering and burden may be short-lived. If symp-
toms are resolving, accommodating the anxiety for a short time
may be tolerable. As soon as possible, the child should go back to
his bedroom and classroom. When separation anxiety persists, the
parent may become exhausted and require respite, so efforts should
be made to integrate other attachment figures into care. Parents may
also benefit from behavioral interventions for caregivers, if family
accommodation is part of the clinical picture (Jones et al. 2015;
Norman et al. 2015).
CBT is helpful for both generalized and separation anxiety and
may involve the cognitive skills of reappraisal and problem solv-
ing. Children learn to assess the probability and the likely severity
of feared events and generate backup plans should the problem
arise. For example, a child might work through the probability that
no one would pick him up from school, articulate realistic outcomes
of being left at school, and list possible actions the child might take
if left. The child might role-play those actions and, with parents,
and design a gradual exposure plan with rewards for following
through. Notifying the school of the issue and identifying ‘‘safe’’
individuals and ways to access them may aid in this endeavor.
Should pharmacotherapy be necessary, benzodiazepines may be
used temporarily. Antihistamines, gabapentin, or clonidine may
help; dosages for these have not been empirically established, so
the recommendation is to begin with small doses and titrate to
effects and side effects. Administration of SSRI’s should follow
guidelines outlined in the section above on OCD.
ADHD symptoms
Some ADHD symptoms seen in PANS/PANDAS may be
manifestations of underlying ADHD. PANS/PANDAS children’s
hyperactivity may reflect anxiety, complex tic sequences, rest-
lessness exacerbated by cognitive and physical fatigue, sensory
overload, pain or urge to urinate, or agitated catatonia (Elia et al.
2005). Inattention may reflect sleep deprivation, mood lability,
intrusive thoughts of OCD, or the cognitive ‘‘fog’’ some PANS/
PANDAS patients describe. Academic frustrations may contribute
to impulsivity and disruptive behaviors.
If the treatment team considers symptoms consistent with
ADHD, management of ADHD symptoms in the context of PANS/
PANDAS is based on our understanding of ADHD management
in general. Typical classroom accommodations, possibly with
pharmacotherapy, may help the child tolerate the classroom and
help the classroom tolerate the child. Useful changes have in-
cluded preferential seating (front and side), permission to take
breaks without interrupting the class and without interruption
(e.g., to do sham errands for the teacher), extended time for tests,
and resource assistance for math and executive function support
and training.
Stimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamine compounds),
the first-line medication for idiopathic ADHD, may be tolerated
and helpful. Methylphenidate may be preferable to amphetamine
preparations as they may have a smaller risk of exacerbating tics
or compulsive behaviors in children with non-PANS/PANDAS
ADHD (Borcherding 1990; Castellanos 1997; Pringsheim 2011).
Some have suggested that amphetamine formulations pose a higher
risk for neurotoxicity, so methylphenidate preparations are pref-
erable (Berman et al. 2009). Atomoxetine, a second line treat-
ment for ADHD symptoms, appears to possess anti-inflammatory
properties through modulation of noradrenaline signaling, and in
so reduces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, down-
regulates cell adhesion molecules important in leukocyte infiltra-
tion, and strengthens the blood–brain barrier (O’Sullivan et al.
2010). Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, guanfacine, and clonidine are
less helpful for ADHD symptoms, but may be the ‘‘treatment of
choice’’ for PANS/PANDAS hyperactivity and impulsivity be-
cause they may also produce improvements in tics, anxiety, and
sleep disruptions.
Sleep disturbances
Disordered sleep in PANS/PANDAS may be a function of sep-
aration anxiety, OCD bedtime rituals, enuresis, nightmares, tem-
perature dysregulation, sleep apnea (sometimes with large tonsils),
or rapid eye movement (REM) Sleep Behavioral Disorder. In the
latter condition, muscle tone is maintained during REM sleep,
permitting movement during dreams. REM Sleep Behavioral Dis-
order, associated with neuroinflammation in other disorders, has
been observed in 12 of 15 children with PANS/PANDAS studied at
NIMH (Gaughan et al. 2016). REM Sleep Behavioral Disorder also
may occur as an adverse effect of SSRI treatment (Lloyd et al.
2012).

THIENEMANN ET AL.
 Employing good sleep hygiene improves the likelihood of
sleeping well, even for children with PANS/PANDAS. The prin-
ciples of sleep hygiene include the following:
� Scheduling regular times to go to bed and get up (even on
weekends) and to set circadian and sleep-wake rhythms
� Healthy sleep habits (e.g., having a consistent, short, pleasant
bedtime routine)
� Comfortable sleep environment (e.g., cool, dark, and quiet),
� Avoid caffeine in the evening and ‘‘wind down’’ toward
bedtime, restricting exercise, high-energy play, and heavy
meals (Moore 2010)
� Restrict evening use of electronic games and toys and turn
off televisions for at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue
light of electronic screens can delay sleep onset and shorten
sleep duration (Hale and Guan 2015)
If behavioral interventions fail to improve sleep, diphenhydra-
mine, melatonin, cyproheptadine, clonidine, trazodone, or zolpi-
dem may be useful; each has anecdotal report of benefit in PANS.
However, controlled studies are lacking, and none of these medi-
cations is approved by the FDA for use in children. A low dose may
be adequate and desirable to minimize side effects.
Depression
Dysphoria and depressive symptoms are common in PANS/
PANDAS, particularly during later stages of the illness (Franko-
vich et al. 2015; Murphy et al. 2015; Swedo et al. 2015). For mild
mood symptoms, supportive interventions, such as individual or
family therapy, may be sufficient. However, children with full-
blown depression, suicidal ideation, or self-injurious behavior re-
quire more intensive treatment. Psychotherapy or psychotherapy
combined with an SSRI is the standard of care for youth with major
depressive episodes (Hopkins et al. 2015). Elements of evidenced
psychotherapies for depression seem particularly useful for chil-
dren with PANS. In Interpersonal Therapy for Adolescents, the
therapist, family, and school recognize that the child is ‘‘sick’’ and
unable to function at usual capacity (Mufson et al. 2004). In CBT
for depression, planning pleasant (and for PANS patients, probably
low-key) experiences comprises part of the behavioral element.
When depressive symptoms are sustained and/or impairing,
clinical experience suggests treatment with an SSRI or bupropion
may be helpful. The medications are started at a low dose, and
parents are advised to watch for emergent adverse effects, par-
ticularly worsening mood, irritability, agitation, hyperactivity,
suicidal thoughts, or sleeplessness. Likewise, when a child’s
symptoms are consistent with bipolar mood disorder, medications
for this indication, given with the same caution, could provide
benefit. In families with a history of bipolar disorder, antidepressant
medications must be used with extreme caution because of the
increased risk of precipitating mania.
Psychosis
At least 25% of children with PANS/PANDAS report auditory,
olfactory, or visual hallucinations (distinct from OCD intrusive
images, Frankovich et al. 2015) If disturbing or impairing, then
antipsychotic medications may be warranted, despite their associ-
ated adverse effects. These are used typically for a short duration to
manage acute psychosis and agitation. Medication choice should
consider minimizing adverse effects and being aware of interac-
tions with other medications. For chronic psychotic symptoms,
diagnosis and ongoing treatment need to be reassessed. In other
encephalitides, the following have been reported helpful: (Kup-
puswamy et al. 2014)
� Aripiprazole (lupus, anti-NMDAR)
� Risperidone (Wilson’s, Hashimoto’s, anti-NMDAR)
� Olanzapine (anti-NMDAR)
� Haloperidol (anti-NMDAR)
� Quetiapine
Pain
While not often volunteered as a complaint, upon questioning, it
has been found that pain is a common comorbidity in PANS pa-
tients (Frankovich et al. 2015). Musculoskeletal pain in PANS is
broadly caused by two factors: inflammatory (arthritis) or a pain
amplification syndrome due to pain processing abnormalities. Pain
due to arthritis typically precedes or presents simultaneously with
the PANS symptoms. Wide-spread pain and other pain amplifica-
tions syndromes more commonly present during the recovery phase
of PANS. If the pain disorder is not diagnosed and treated early, it
can develop into a refractory pain syndrome. When widespread
pain is present, patients often report other forms of sensory am-
plification (increased sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes
smells), abdominal pain, headaches, muscle aches, waking un-
refreshed, daytime fatigue, ‘‘foggy brain,’’ and depression. Physi-
cal examination may reveal areas of tenderness to palpation in the
classic distribution for fibromyalgia. Patients who report both pain
and stiffness upon awakening or after prolonged stationary posi-
tions should be assessed further for arthritis, enthesitis, and in-
flammatory back pain. Involvement of a pediatric rheumatologist
and/or pain specialist, occupational therapist, and physical thera-
pist is necessary for treating these pain conditions. Alleviation of
pain will secondarily improve emotional and physical functioning.
Conclusion
The treatment of PANS/PANDAS is symptom based and closely
mirrors that of childhood mental illness of idiopathic etiologies.
Mainstays of treatment include psychoeducational, psychothera-
peutic, behavioral, family, school-based, and pharmacological in-
terventions, which reduce suffering and improve functioning until
the immunologic and infectious processes are addressed. For-
tunately, many patients with PANS/PANDAS will recover com-
pletely and symptomatic treatments can be discontinued. Others
are less fortunate and have ongoing symptoms that require con-
tinuous intervention and accommodation. At present, we are unable
to predict the individual differences in the course and prognosis of
individual PANS/PANDAS cases. Additional research is needed to
understand the clinical heterogeneity associated with these cases.
Clinical Significance
Until further research informs clinicians about effective treat-
ments for behavioral and psychiatric interventions for children with
PANS and Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Syndrome
Associated with Streptococcal Infection (PANDAS), current liter-
ature and clinical experience must guide clinicians treating these
children. This article fills the gap between empiric therapy and
current knowledge by conveying consensus guidelines for symp-
tomatic treatment of children with PANS and PANDAS.
