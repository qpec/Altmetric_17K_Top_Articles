Abstract
Background—Few pathologic data are available on cerebral vessel disease, dementia, and 
cognition. This cross-sectional study examined associations of cerebral atherosclerosis and 
arteriolosclerosis neuropathology with probable and possible Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia 
and level of cognitive function, in a large group of older persons who came to autopsy.
Methods—1,143 older women or men (median age-at-death = 88.8 years; 42% with AD 
dementia) underwent annual clinical evaluations and agreed to brain autopsy at time-of-death, as 
part of one of two cohort studies of aging. Neuropsychological data proximate-to-death were used 
to create summary measures of global cognition and cognitive domains. Data across all years were 
used to determine presence of the clinical syndrome of AD dementia. Systematic neuropathologic 
evaluations documented severity of cerebral large (atherosclerosis) and small vessel disease 
(arteriolosclerosis). Using regression analyses adjusted for demographics, gross and micro-infarcts 
and AD pathology, we examined associations of vessel disease severity with odds of probable and 
possible AD dementia and level of cognition.
Findings—Moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis was present in 445 (39%) subjects, and 
arteriolosclerosis in 401 (35%). The odds of AD dementia was higher with moderate-to-severe 
atherosclerosis (OR=1.33; 95%CI:1.11–1.58) and arteriolosclerosis (OR=1.20; 95%CI:1.04–1.40). 
Atherosclerosis was associated with lower scores for global cognition (estimate= −0.10, SE=0.04;

 p=0.00096) and four cognitive domains (episodic memory, semantic memory, perceptual speed 
and visuospatial abilities; all p<0.019) but not working memory (p=0.21). Arteriolosclerosis was 
associated with lower scores for global cognition (estimate= −0.10, SE=0.03; p=0.0015) and four 
domains (all p<0.046), and a borderline/non-significant association was noted for visuospatial 
abilities (p=0.052). Findings were unchanged in analyses controlling for APOEε4 and vascular 
risk factors.
Interpretation—Cerebral atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis each contribute to the odds of 
AD dementia by 20–30% per level increase in severity, and are associated with lower scores in 
most cognitive domains. Associations remain after taking into account AD and infarct pathologies, 
and vascular factors. Cerebral vessel pathology may be an under-recognized risk factor for AD 
dementia.

Introduction
Cerebral vascular disease is very common in aging and associated with poor health 
outcomes, with stroke identified as second leading cause of death in the world in 2012.1 
Research has now consistently shown that cerebral vascular disease, including as identified 
on neuroimaging and neuropathology, lowers the threshold for the clinical expression of 
dementia.2 Indeed, stroke and its’ major pathologic underpinning, cerebral infarct, are 
established risk factors for dementia and cognitive impairment, and both gross and 
microscopic infarcts have been related to dementia in pathologic studies.2 Less is known 
about the role of other cerebral vascular disease, specifically atherosclerosis and 
arteriolosclerosis. Available data suggest that large vessel disease, and especially 
atherosclerosis, may increase risk of dementia, and as well Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
dementia more specifically,3 however, previous studies of atherosclerosis have largely 
concentrated on in-vivo data which are not able to control for the mediating or confounding 
effects of microinfarcts and AD pathology. In addition, previous studies have focused on 
imaging of extracranial vessel disease and cannot clarify the potential role of intracranial 
vessels, and particularly small vessels, in dementia. There are also little data on the 
association of vessel disease and cognitive systems. Similar to studies on infarcts, in-vivo 
studies of atherosclerosis showed cognitive systems involving executive function and 
processing speed appear to be particularly affected, in contrast to memory systems.4,5 And, 
we are not aware of any studies of arteriolosclerosis and cognitive systems.
Cerebral vessels remain difficult to assess in-vivo and examination of postmortem tissue in 
prospectively followed older persons is a useful tool to directly evaluate cerebral vessel 
pathologies and determine their relationship to dementia.6–10 However, few studies have 
examined cerebral vessel disease and cognition, and we are not aware of any previously

 published study which examined associations of these pathologies with performance-based 
measures of specific cognitive systems.
The present study examined the relationship of two common cerebral vessel pathologies in 
aging with AD dementia and cognition. Subjects included 1,143 deceased and autopsied 
women and men, participating in one of two clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging. 
Subjects enrolled without dementia and underwent detailed annual clinical evaluations, 
which included assessment of cognitive function and classification of dementia status. At 
time-of-death, neuropathologic evaluations of the brain documented severity of cerebral 
vessel pathology, and other data on common neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies of 
aging. We tested whether two cerebral vessel pathologies, atherosclerosis and 
arteriolosclerosis, were associated with higher odds of probable or possible AD dementia 
and lower levels of cognitive function proximate-to-death, using summary measures of 
global cognition and five separate cognitive domains. We also examined whether 
associations were independent of AD and infarct pathologies, or affected by APOEε4 and 
vascular risk factors.
Methods
This cross-sectional study follows recommendations made in, and is reported according to, 
the STROBE statement.
Subjects
Study subjects were participants in a prospective, community-based, clinical-pathologic 
cohort study of aging, either the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging 
Project. Both cohort studies have received approval from the Rush University Medical 
Center, Institutional Review Board. Methods were published elsewhere and are summarized 
here.11,12 Both study designs follow essentially identical methods, including recruitment, 
and biospecimen and data collection, thus facilitating the combination of data to examine the 
relation of clinical and pathologic factors in the aging brain. At time of enrollment, each 
subject consents to undergo annual clinical evaluations, and signs an anatomical gift act 
agreeing to brain donation at time of death. Follow-up and autopsy rates in both studies are 
high, and more than 80%.
The Religious Orders Study began enrolling participants in 1994. To date, there have been 
1,285 Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers who underwent a baseline clinical evaluation, 
including detailed neuropsychological testing (see below). After excluding the 2 subjects 
who withdrew over the course of the study, of the remaining subjects, there were 694 who 
have died, and of these, 640 have come to autopsy (92% autopsy rate). Complete 
neuropathologic data in subjects without dementia or with AD dementia, necessary to 
conduct this study, were available on the first 586 subjects, included in analyses here.
The Rush Memory and Aging Project began in 1997, and there are 1,771 participants to date 
who have undergone a baseline clinical evaluation. Of these, 11 withdrew from the study, 
750 have died, and 614/750 deceased subjects underwent a brain autopsy (82% autopsy

 rate). The first 557 subjects without dementia or with AD dementia, and with complete 
neuropathologic data available, were included in analyses in this study.
Clinical data
Uniform and structured baseline and annual clinical evaluations were identical in all 
essential components, and included a medical history, physical examination with a focus on 
the neurological examination, and detailed neuropsychological testing, as previously 
described.11,12 All data were entered on laptop computers using the Blaise system (Westat).
Neuropsychological testing, administered at each clinical evaluation, consisted of a 
standardized battery of a broad range of tests of different abilities, as published before.13 In 
addition to the Mini-Mental State Examination, there were 17 individual tests of cognition, 
which were summarized into composite measures of five cognitive domains and an overall 
score of global cognition (based on all tests).13 Seven tests were used to create a measure of 
episodic memory, three tests for semantic memory, three tests for working memory, two tests 
for perceptual speed, and two tests for visuospatial abilities. These summary measures 
decreased ceiling artifact and other sources of measurement error, and have been used in 
many of our previous studies.11,12 All data were reviewed by a neuropsychologist blinded to 
data collected in previous years. For this study on the relation of cerebral vessel disease to 
cognitive function, we used cognitive data most proximate-to-death, in the primary analyses.
Clinicians with expertise in dementia review clinical data from a given year, blinded to 
previously collected data, in order to classify each participant by dementia status, following 
published recommendations.14 At time of a participant’s death, a board-certified neurologist 
with expertise in dementia (authors ZA and DAB), blinded to all pathologic data, reviewed 
clinical data from across the study years to classify dementia status proximate-to-death. For 
this study, we used a dichotomous outcome measure for the presence vs. absence of 
probable or possible Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia, in accordance with the published 
criteria for the diagnosis of dementia due to AD.11,12,14 The term “AD dementia” refers to 
the clinical syndrome of AD and to those with either probable or possible AD dementia. 
This designation was dichotomous and made without the use of biomarkers.
The clinical evaluations included a blood draw, from which APOEε4 data were derived as 
previously reported,15 and documentation of vascular risk factors, including hypertension, 
diabetes, and smoking, from which the number of vascular risk factors present was 
computed.
Neuropathologic data
Each autopsied brain underwent a systematic neuropathologic evaluation, blinded to clinical 
data, as previously published.16 Briefly, a uniform gross and histologic evaluation for 
common age-related pathologies is conducted, and includes a detailed assessment of 
cerebrovascular disease.
Cerebral vessel disease is documented in large and small vessels.17,18 Atherosclerosis 
describes the segmental or circumferential subintimal accumulation of lipid, plasma 
proteins, and calcium deposition (plaque) in the walls of large arteries and was assessed on

 gross examination, by visual inspection of vessels in the Circle of Willis. Vessels included 
the vertebral, basilar, posterior cerebral, middle cerebral, and anterior cerebral arteries and 
their proximal branches. Severity was graded using a semi-quantitative scale, based on 
involvement of each artery and number of arteries involved, from 0 (no atherosclerosis) to 6 
(severe atherosclerosis, with all visualized large arteries affected or one artery completely 
occluded). Arteriolosclerosis describes concentric hyaline thickening of small vessel walls, 
with emphasis placed on arterioles less than 50 microns. Arteriolosclerosis was documented 
on the histologic examination, by using H&E stained sections of the anterior basal ganglia 
(caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and internal capsule). Severity was also graded based on 
vessel wall thickening, and ranged from 0 (no arteriolosclerosis) to 7 (complete small vessel 
occlusion), as described elsewhere.18 In analyses for this study, the severity of both vessel 
pathologies was grouped into four levels for primary analyses (not present, mild, moderate, 
and severe), and in some other analyses, into two levels (moderate-to-severe, versus not 
present-to-mild).
Neuropathologic data also included systematic assessment for other common cerebral 
vascular disease and neurodegenerative diseases, and have been published elsewhere.11,12 In 
summary, gross (macroscopic) infarcts were identified on gross examination, and classified 
by number, volume (in mm2) and location, and each infarct was then dissected and 
confirmed on microscopic examination using H&E, and classified by age (chronic, subacute, 
acute).16 Microinfarcts, defined as infarcts not visible to the naked eye and identified only 
under microscopy, were identified in blocks of nine brain regions that were paraffin 
embedded and stained with H&E.19 Location and age of microinfarcts were also recorded. 
For this study, only chronic gross and micro-infarcts were considered, and all infarct 
variables were dichotomized into present (one or more) vs. absent (none, as reference 
group).
In addition to cerebral vascular disease pathology, neurodegenerative pathology data were 
available. The continuous, global AD pathology score takes into account counts of neuritic 
plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles from a 1mm2 area (of greatest density), 
from sections of entorhinal, hippocampus, midfrontal, middle temporal, and inferior parietal 
cortices, using a modified silver stain.15 Data on the pathologic diagnosis of AD was also 
available. The Lewy body pathology measure is based on the presence of any Lewy bodies 
on α-synuclein immunostaining.20
Analytic approach
Descriptive statistics of demographic, clinical, and neuropathologic characteristics of 
subjects were examined in the total group, and then among those with and without AD 
dementia. Associations among cerebral vessel pathologies and age were quantified with 
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients. We examined the relationship of cerebral vessel 
pathology to the clinical outcomes of AD dementia (clinical syndrome of AD, including 
subjects with either probable or possible AD dementia) and cognitive function. Analyses in 
the study included terms to adjust for pertinent demographic (age-at-death, sex, and 
education) and neuropathologic variables (gross infarcts, microinfarcts, AD pathology, and 
Lewy body pathology). A nominal threshold of p<0.05 was imposed for statistical

 significance and p values are reported with two significant digits, unless <0.0001. In the 
primary analysis for AD dementia, we used a logistic regression model to examine the odds 
of AD dementia (outcome) by severity level of atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis (with 
both vessel terms in a single model). In this model, the primary predictors of interest were 
the severity grades of the two vessel pathologies (mild, moderate, and severe), with no vessel 
pathology as the reference group. Secondary analyses examined whether the presence of an 
APOEε4 allele (one or two alleles) or vascular risk factors affected the results (at least one 
of hypertension, diabetes, or smoking). Separate secondary analyses provided tests for effect 
modification of vessel disease by each of age-at-death, any brain infarct (gross or 
microscopic), and AD pathology (first using the global AD pathology measure; then using 
the pathologic diagnosis of high and intermediate likelihood of AD vs. low likelihood and 
no AD). For these tests, we added two additional terms in each of the three analyses, one 
term for the interaction of atherosclerosis by the variable of interest (e.g., age-at-death), and 
the other term for the interaction of arteriolosclerosis by the same variable.
Because cognitive function is a complex construct with a range of types of function (e.g., 
domains) and levels of function/impairment, in addition to examining for the odds of AD 
dementia, this study also aimed to examine the association of vessel pathology with level of 
cognition proximate-to-death in different cognitive domains. For the primary analyses for 
cognitive function, we used a set of six linear regression analyses to examine the 
associations of vessel pathology with level of global cognition (one outcome) and cognitive 
function in five separate cognitive domains (five outcomes). Each of the six models included 
the same nine terms as in the primary analysis with AD dementia as the outcome: age-at-
death, sex, education, gross infarcts, microinfarcts, AD pathology, Lewy body pathology, 
atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis. Standard diagnostic methods and graphical 
examination of residuals were used to verify the assumptions underlying the statistical 
models. To examine the effects of APOEε4 and vascular risk factors effects on the 
associations of vessel disease with cognition, as well as effect modification by age-at-death, 
any infarct, and AD pathology, we followed the approach outlined for the analysis of AD 
dementia. Finally, we conducted additional sensitivity analyses to address whether severity 
of dementia proximate-to-death affect the results.
We evaluated the models for violations of the core model assumptions and conducted 
graphical analyses of data. All analyses were programmed in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, NC).

 Results
Demographic, clinical and neuropsychological characteristics
The demographic, clinical, and neuropathologic characteristics of the 1,143 subjects 
included in the study are shown in Table 1. In the total group, vessel pathology was 
common, and moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis was present in almost 40% of subjects, and 
arteriolosclerosis in 35%, with 19% of all subjects (221/1,143) having a moderate or more 
severe grade of both vessel pathologies. Atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis were 
associated with one-another (rs=0.30, p<0.0001). We also found associations of each of the 
two vessel pathologies with age, with both having rs=0.15 and p<0.0001. Compared to those 
without dementia, subjects with probable or possible AD dementia (478/1,143; 42%) were 
older and more likely to be female, to have an APOEε4 allele, lower cognitive scores 
proximate-to-death, and more vascular and AD pathology (all p values <0.026). Cognitive 
data were complete (no missing data on any of the 17 neuropsychological tests) in 1,069 of 
1,143 (94%) subjects; 44 (4%) had missing data on one test; and the remaining (2%) had 
missing data on more than one test. Supplemental data on the neuropsychological tests used 
to create the global cognitive score are presented in a table in the Appendix. The distribution 
of vessel disease (atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis) among subjects with and without 
AD dementia is illustrated in Figure 1. This figure suggests that a higher proportion of 
persons with AD dementia have vessel disease.
Vessel disease and odds of AD dementia
The primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship of cerebral vessel 
pathology to the clinical syndrome of AD dementia. We found that each level increase in the 
severity of atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis was associated with significantly higher 
odds of AD dementia (Table 2). The association was stronger for atherosclerosis (OR=1.33) 
than for arteriolosclerosis (OR=1.20), adjusted for age, AD pathology, and gross and micro-
infarcts.
Comparing the associations of vessel disease with AD dementia to that of gross infarcts, 
shows that moderate atherosclerosis and severe arteriolosclerosis have comparable effects to 
gross infarcts (OR=1.63). The effects of vessel pathology on the probability of AD dementia 
are shown in Figure 2, panel A.
We next explored whether other factors may account for the observed associations of vessel 
disease with AD dementia. In these secondary analyses, we first controlled for the presence 
of APOEε4. Results were essentially unchanged, with both atherosclerosis (OR=1.31; 
95%CI:1.11–1.57) and arteriolosclerosis (OR=1.21; 95%CI:1.04–1.41) remaining associated 
with a higher odds of AD dementia. In another model, we controlled for vascular risk factors 
(hypertension, diabetes, and smoking), and again, results were similar for both 
atherosclerosis (OR=1.32; 95%CI:1.10–1.58) and arteriolosclerosis (OR=1.19; 95%CI:1.02–
1.39). Finally, four additional analyses separately examined for the presence of interactions 
of vessel disease by each of 1) age, 2) any infarct (gross or microscopic), and AD pathology 
using 3) the global measure and separately, 4) the pathologic diagnosis of AD. No 
interactions were found (all p>0.25), suggesting that the associations of atherosclerosis and

 arteriolosclerosis with AD dementia were not modified by age or the other common 
pathologies of dementia (infarcts and AD).
Vessel disease and level of global and domain specific cognitive function
We first considered the outcome of global cognition and then the outcomes of five separate 
cognitive domains, including episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, 
perceptual speed, and visuospatial abilities. Greater severity of both atherosclerosis and 
arteriolosclerosis were each associated with lower scores for global cognition (Table 3). The 
additive effects of vessel disease on lower global cognitive function, after taking 
demographic and other common vascular and neurodegenerative pathologies of dementia 
into account, are depicted in Figure 2, panel B. In similar models for each of the five 
cognitive domains, we found associations of both vessel diseases with lower scores for 
function in each of the five cognitive domains, with the exception that atherosclerosis was 
not related to working memory, and arteriolosclerosis showed a borderline and non-
significant association with visuospatial abilities (Table 3).
Secondary analyses were conducted to evaluate whether other factors affect the results with 
global cognition. Controlling for APOEε4 and vascular risk factors in two separate models 
did not change observed associations of vessel disease with lower scores for global cognition 
(all p values <0.087). Further, vessel disease did not interact with age, any infarct, or AD 
pathology using separately the global measure and pathologic diagnosis of AD (p>0.15 for 
all eight interaction terms), suggesting that the observed associations of vessel disease with 
cognition is not modified by these factors.
We conducted additional analyses to address the question whether results were affected by 
severity of dementia proximate-to-death. First, we repeated the analysis (from Table 3) but 
using the second to last evaluation proximate-to-death (rather than the last) as the global 
cognitive outcome measure. Second, we repeated the analysis but excluding those with 
severe cognitive impairment (those in the bottom 10th percentile on the measure of global 
cognition). Results for these two sets of analyses were consistent with results in the primary 
analyses (Table 3), with levels of severity of both atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis being 
associated with lower cognition (all p<0.040).
Discussion
In this study of more than 1,100 community-dwelling older persons with and without 
dementia who came to autopsy, we found that moderate or more severe cerebral 
atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis are both common, being observed in more than a third 
of subjects, and that higher severity grades in each vessel pathology independently increase 
the odds of probable and possible AD dementia, independent of the effect of infarcts and AD 
pathology. Interestingly, both atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis are associated with lower 
scores on summary measures of a range of cognitive domains, including episodic memory, 
the hallmark of AD pathology, as well as perceptual speed, the hallmark of vascular 
pathologies.

 Scientific work by many research groups have now established a relation of vascular disease, 
and cerebral vascular disease in particular, to dementia including the clinical syndrome of 
AD dementia, and to cognitive impairment.2–10, 21–23 While there is a substantial body of 
literature suggesting that extracranial atherosclerosis, usually detected by in-vivo imaging 
such as ultrasonography, is associated with a higher risk of dementia, including AD 
dementia,3, 21–23 these in-vivo studies cannot adequately address the direct role of large 
artery atherosclerosis separate from the downstream effects of infarcts, especially those less 
than 3mm and not detected by routine neuroimaging; as well as effects of AD pathology. 
Indeed, atherosclerosis is related to not only gross infarcts but also microinfarcts.18,24 A 
recent study using postmortem data from about 600 older persons, found that internal carotid 
artery stenosis of >70% was associated with a doubled odds of dementia.25 Analyses were 
not adjusted for gross or micro-infarcts, nor for other common brain pathology, whether AD 
pathology or arteriolosclerosis. Few studies have specifically examined intracranial vessel. 
Several clinical-pathologic studies from another group, including smaller studies with 20 to 
100 subjects and one study with nearly 400 subjects, have shown that atherosclerosis in the 
circle of Willis is associated with dementia, including AD dementia.6, 8, 10, 26 Another study 
of 200 subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging Cohort, found that the 
presence of intracranial atherosclerosis (found in about two-thirds of the cohort) was 
associated with a higher odds of dementia separately from brain infarcts including 
microinfarcts.9 Our study confirms these findings and advances the field in several important 
ways. We found that more severe atherosclerosis in the circle of Willis corresponds to the 
odds of AD dementia being higher by about 30% per level increase in severity of vessel 
disease, even after taking into account arteriolosclerosis, and controlling for both gross and 
microscopic infarcts, as well as AD pathology. Further, other factors commonly associated 
with dementia were also considered. APOEε4 and vascular risk factors, such as hypertension 
and diabetes, did not affect the observed associations. Also, age, infarcts, and AD pathology 
did not modify the effects of cerebral vessel disease on AD dementia. Moreover, results 
were not modified by the presence vs. absence of a pathologic diagnosis of AD suggesting 
that vessel pathology contributes to cognitive impairment similarly in those with and without 
an underlying AD pathophysiologic process. Given the relationships of atherosclerosis and 
infarcts, and of atherosclerosis and AD pathology in some studies, these data strongly 
suggest that atherosclerosis may be directly contributing to brain functional impairment 
(dementia) through mechanisms other than infarcts or AD pathology.
There has been increasing interest in the role of small vessel disease and dementia. While 
studies of microinfarcts are common, we are not aware of any previous study relating 
cerebral arteriolosclerosis to dementia. Our data show that pathologically detected 
arteriolosclerosis is independently associated with a higher odds of AD dementia (in this 
case, 20% higher per level increase in severity of arteriosclerosis). Again, this appears to be 
a separate effect from the effects of infarcts and AD pathology, and the finding remains 
unchanged when controlling for other factors that are associated with dementia, including 
APOEε4 and vascular risk factors. The ORs for dementia were not affected by age or by the 
presence/severity of other common neuropathologies. Of note, though there was a 
relationship between atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis, they were both considered in the 
same model and were found to be independently associated with AD dementia. The

 pathophysiologic pathways linking large and small cerebral vessel disease to dementia need 
further characterization.
Because dementia occurs along a disease spectrum and typically starts with more limited 
impairment in select cognitive domains, we also wanted to examine the relation of cerebral 
vessel pathology to overall and specific cognitive functions. This examination may allow 
early detection and treatment of impairment, clinical discrimination of AD vs. vascular 
pathologies, and shed further light into the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which vessel 
disease leads to dementia. The scientific data available to date on the association of vessel 
disease with cognition is largely derived from studies of peripheral and extracranial 
vasculature, and has focused on atherosclerosis. These data suggest, rather consistently, that 
atherosclerosis outside the brain is associated with lower levels of cognition and cognitive 
impairment, even among persons without dementia.27–32 In addition, one study used brain 
autopsy data of vessel disease, in 47 cases for whom a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 
score was retrospectively determined.33 Authors found that cerebral small vessel disease, 
including “arteriosclerosis/lipohyalinosis”, was inversely/negatively correlated with the CDR 
score. We are not aware of any previous study examining the relationship of cerebral vessels 
to performance-based measures of cognition. Our novel data show that greater severity in 
each of cerebral atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis, is associated with a lower levels of 
function in a performance-based summary measure of global cognition. These findings are 
independent of infarcts and AD pathology, are unchanged when controlling for APOEε4 and 
vascular risk factors, and are not modified by age or other pathologies. Furthermore, we 
examined relations of both cerebral vessel diseases to five separate cognitive domains, and 
found that atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis were associated with lower performance 
across almost all domains, including memory and perceptual speed. This suggests that the 
effect of cerebral vessel disease on cognition may be more widespread than anticipated, and 
contrast with reports suggesting that peripheral atherosclerosis is associated with specifically 
executive function and processing speed, rather than with memory.4,5
Mechanisms underlying the associations of cerebral vessel diseases with a higher odds of the 
clinical syndrome of AD dementia and with lower function on a range of cognitive domains 
remain elusive. Indeed, vascular risk factor studies are limited in their ability to determine 
underlying mechanisms linking vessel disease to dementia. In our neuropathologic study, we 
considered several mechanisms. One mechanism may be through AD pathology itself, for 
instance if cerebral vessel pathology somehow hindered clearance of amyloid-beta from the 
brain and promoted accumulation of this protein and deposition of plaques. Previously 
published neuropathologic studies on cerebral vessels and AD pathology are mixed, with 
some studies showing an association and others not.24,33–35 While we did not examine the 
relation of cerebral vessel disease with AD pathology here, this raises the possibility that 
other mechanisms are at play, possibly resulting in an effect by which cerebral vessel disease 
lowers the threshold for the clinical expression of AD. This mechanism has been postulated 
for other biologic processes leading to dementia, including vascular ones such as diabetes.36 
Another mechanism is that cerebral vessel disease increases dementia via other vascular 
pathologies, most notable infarction. Indeed, we have recently shown that atherosclerosis 
and arteriolosclerosis are each associated with microinfarcts, and subcortical microinfarcts 
in particular, and that microinfarcts are associated with an increased odds of dementia and

 with lower cognition.18,19 Nonetheless, our findings reported here were after accounting for 
both AD pathology, and gross infarcts and microinfarcts as co-variates in analyses. In 
addition, AD pathology and the presence of infarcts did not modify the association of vessel 
disease with dementia. These findings suggest that cerebral vessel diseases are linked to 
dementia via mechanisms other than AD pathology or frank infarction. Interestingly, 
microinfarcts were not strongly related to cognition with vessel diseases and gross infarcts 
included the statistical models. However, our assessment of microinfarcts is likely not 
capturing all of this pathology given the limited sampling of brain regions. The role of 
microinfarcts and other vascular pathologies needs further research. Indeed, other vascular 
pathologies such as white matter disease, have not been considered. Therefore, these and 
other plausible mechanisms need to be examined in future studies of cerebral vessel disease 
and dementia and cognitive function, including breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and others (for review, please see37).
This study has several limitations. First, this is an observational study and does not establish 
causation between brain pathology and function. Indeed, most neuropathologic studies 
examine for associations, but can only infer causation and mechanism. Yet, this limitation is 
inherent to most clinical-pathologic studies, and in the absence of in-vivo assessment of 
intracerebral vessel disease, these designs are currently one of the only ways to examine 
cerebral vessel disease, particularly small vessel disease, and dementia in humans, 
underscoring the value of clinical-pathologic studies in research on mechanisms contributing 
to dementia. Furthermore, neuropathologic studies are uniquely poised to take into account 
the full range of the most common causes of dementia, namely AD pathology and vascular 
disease including microinfarcts, which cannot be easily detected postmortem at this time. 
Controlling for, and looking for interactions with these pathologies are important 
considerations in order to determine the independent effects of cerebral vessel diseases on 
dementia. Second, the extent of the cerebral vessel disease is likely underreported in our data 
collection and only select areas of vasculature were examined, a particularly notable 
weakness for the assessment of atherosclerosis which was limited to the circle of Willis. 
Third, this study was not able to characterize the mechanisms linking vessel disease to 
dementia and lower cognition. Importantly, we did not assess for white matter disease, yet 
this pathology likely plays a role in the relation of vessel disease to cognition. Finally, while 
we examined for confounding and effect modification by age, and conducted additional 
analyses taking severity of dementia into account, we cannot exclude that these and other 
factors may play a role in the relation of vessel disease to dementia.
There are important strengths of this study. Logistic regression analyses are event-driven and 
the number of events in this sample (AD dementia) was large.38 Indeed, there was a total of 
478 AD dementia events among the 1,143 subjects, and models considered a total of nine 
variables (Table 2), with an adequate event-per-variable (EPV) ratio of 53. The total sample 
size was large and subjects with and without dementia were derived from a prospective, 
community-based cohort study with high follow-up and autopsy rates, enhancing the study 
validity and generalizability of the findings. Also, data in our study is overall very complete, 
with at least 94% (1,077 of the total of 1,143) subjects included in the models. Participants 
not included in the models did not differ by age or sex (data not shown). The clinical 
evaluations provided detailed, performance-based neuropsychological test data collected

 annually, summarized in measures of global cognition and separate cognitive domains, and 
included cognitive data and dementia status proximate-to-death. Furthermore, the 
neuropathologic data were available on two different but related types of cerebral vessel 
diseases and analyses considered severity grade rather than dichotomous measures of 
present vs. not. Also, neuropathologic evaluations were conducted blinded to clinical data, 
and documented the known common pathologies of dementia including infarcts and AD 
pathology, which were included in analyses of this study. Finally, confidence in our findings 
from this cross-sectional, clinical-pathologic study is strengthened by several factors, 
including 1) the biologic plausibility of a relation of cerebral vessel disease to dementia; 2) 
the consistency of the findings for both dementia and cognitive impairment across domains, 
and consistency of our findings with the literature, and 3) the strength of the associations 
detected.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
We conducted a review of the published medical literature, using PubMed up to January 
2016, with the terms atherosclerosis and (arteriolosclerosis or lipohyalinosis) and 
dementia. No limits were set in any of the filters. This yielded 16 citations which were 
each reviewed. After excluding the six review articles, one case report, and four studies 
with a small number of subjects (n<75), there were 5 remaining studies. None of these 
five studies directly examined either dementia or cognition, in relation to both 
atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis. This systematic review of the literature suggests 
that little is known about the relation of intracranial cerebral vessel disease to dementia 
and cognition. Furthermore, there are few pathologic studies on intracranial vascular 
disease and dementia. Yet, pathologic studies are able to capture data not only on large 
but also small vessel pathology, which can only be indirectly assessed using in-vivo 
imaging. Moreover, as cerebral vessel disease is related to infarcts, and arguably AD 
pathology, the most common underlying dementia pathologies, pathologic studies are 
able to control for infarcts, as well as AD pathology, to study the independent effect of 
both atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis separate from these other common pathologies.
Added value of this study
This clinical-pathologic study examined association of cerebral large vessel 
(atherosclerosis) and small vessel (arteriolosclerosis) neuropathology with the clinical 
syndrome of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia and with the level of cognitive function 
proximate-to-death, in a large group of more than 1,100 older, community-dwelling 
persons with and without dementia, who were clinically evaluated annually until death 
and came to autopsy. Results show that atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis are related 
to each other, but each separately contributes to the odds of AD dementia by 20–30% per 
level increase in vessel disease severity. Atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis are 
associated with lower scores in perceptual speed, the hallmark of vascular pathology, but 
also in episodic memory, typically considered the hallmark of AD dementia. Results are 
independent of the effects of infarcts (both gross and micro-infarcts) and AD pathology, 
and not modified by age, infarcts, or AD pathologies. And, results are essentially 
unchanged when taking APOEε4 and vascular risk factors into account. These data add 
important information to the current state of knowledge of intracranial vessel disease and 
dementia and cognition.
Implications of all the available evidence
Cerebral vessel pathologies, specifically intracranial atherosclerosis and 
arteriolosclerosis, are both common, under-recognized, and independent pathologies 
associated with AD dementia. This study lays the foundation for future research to 
examine pathophysiologic mechanisms by which vessel disease leads to dementia, to 
discriminate cognitive impairment from AD versus vascular pathology, and to detect and 
treat in the early phases the cognitive impairment due to vessel disease.

Distribution of cerebral vessel disease, with and without infarcts, shown separately in 
subjects with and without AD dementia
Legend: The distribution of cerebral vessel disease (atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis) is 
shown in the left panel for subjects without dementia, and in the right panel for subjects with 
AD dementia. Each wedge of the pie shows the proportion of subjects with or without 
atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and/or infarct(s), with percentages indicated at the 
periphery. Atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis (in color) are considered present when of 
moderate severity or greater. Infarcts are considered present if any infarct, whether a gross or 
micro-infarct, is detected on the neuropathologic evaluation. The proportion of subjects in 
each vessel category who also have infarcts is shown in black diagonal lines (hatch). Note 
the increased proportion of subjects with vessel disease among subjects with AD dementia, 
compared to those without.
