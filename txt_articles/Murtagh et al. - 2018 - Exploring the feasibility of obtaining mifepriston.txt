Abstract
Objectives: We aimed to document the experience of buying abortion pills from online vendors that do not require a prescription and to
evaluate the active ingredient content of the pills received.
Study design: We searched the internet to identify a convenience sample of websites that sold mifepristone and misoprostol to purchasers in
the United States and attempted to order these products. We documented price, shipping time and other aspects of ordering. We sent the
samples received to a testing laboratory that measured the amount of active ingredient in individual tablets.
Results: We identified 18 websites and ordered 22 products: 20 mifepristone–misoprostol combination products and 2 that contained only
misoprostol. We received 18 combination products and the 2 misoprostol products from 16 different sites. No site required a prescription or
any relevant medical information. The time between order and receipt of the 20 products ranged from 3 to 21 business days (median 9.5
days). The price for the 18 combination products ranged from $110 to $360, including shipping and fees; the products without mifepristone
cost less. Chemical assays found that the 18 tablets labeled 200 mg mifepristone contained between 184.3 mg and 204.1 mg mifepristone,
while the 20 tablets labeled 200 mcg misoprostol contained between 34.1 mcg and 201.4 mcg of the active ingredient.
Conclusions: Obtaining abortion medications from online pharmaceutical websites is feasible in the United States. The mifepristone tablets received
contained within 8% of the labeled amount of active agent. The misoprostol tablets all contained that compound but usually less than labeled.
Implications statement: Given our findings, we expect that some people for whom clinic-based abortion is not easily available or acceptable
may consider self-sourcing pills from the internet to be a rational option.

1. Background
For over a decade, women in many countries have been
able to obtain abortion pills online from Women on Web
(www.womenonweb.org) and more recently from safe2-
choose (safe2choose.org) and Women Help Women
(womenhelp.org). To date, however, none of these organiza-
tions have provided the service to people in the United States.
Nonetheless, as abortion becomes more difficult to access
through the formal health care system in this country due to
restrictive laws, clinic closures, economic barriers and
harassment, pregnant people in this country desiring abortion
may seek alternative sources [1], including online pharmacies
that offer abortion pills without a prescription. Moreover,
some people may prefer the convenience, privacy and
self-agency that they perceive such sources to provide [2].
In this study, we investigated the process of buying
abortion pills from online sources that offered to ship to
customers in the United States, and we evaluated the quality
of the pills received.

 2. Methods
2.1. Procurement
We searched Google using terms such as “buy abortion
pills online” and “abortion pills online” to identify a
convenience sample of websites that claimed to sell and
ship mifepristone and misoprostol by mail to people in the
United States without a prescription. We also obtained
website recommendations from colleagues who had
interviewed people researching their options for abortion
medications online. Many sites offered multiple products
advertised as containing both mifepristone and misopros-
tol, and these products were usually offered for approx-
imately the same price. If a site offered multiple similar
products, we opted to buy one called “MTP Kit” if
available; products with this designation were the most
commonly offered across sites. If an MTP Kit was not
available, we purchased “Mifegest Kits.” From two sites,
we purchased products advertised as containing only
misoprostol.
Five researchers in four states (TX, WA, CA and NY)
ordered pills and had them shipped to residential addresses in
their state. Standard shipping was generally selected, except
in four cases where express shipping was selected because
the lower bound of the estimated standard shipping time was
greater than 12 days. The researchers recorded information
about the websites, price, payment, shipping, packaging and
communications with vendors.
2.2. Chemical assay
Researchers in states other than NY forwarded all
packages received to NY by mail for storage at room
temperature until we were ready to send them to a laboratory
for chemical assay. At that time, we removed the tablets from
each blister pack and placed the pills labeled mifepristone (if
any) in one bag and all of the misoprostol pills in another,
both labeled with their assigned ID letter. We did this
separately for every product. The label did not reveal the
identity of the website from which the pills were obtained.
We mailed the bags to a testing laboratory that is registered
and in good standing with the US Food and Drug
Administration. The laboratory selected one tablet from
each bag and assayed it for mifepristone or misoprostol
chemical composition as labeled. The mifepristone assay
used the reversed-phase high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC) method used by this laboratory for testing
of mifepristone tablets sold in the United States, adjusted for
a single tablet. For the misoprostol assay, the laboratory
developed a reversed-phase HPLC method and verified the
linearity of analyte responses to confirm the suitability of the
method for the single-tablet assay purpose. We assessed the
relationship between the misoprostol content of the pills and
the interval between package receipt and assay using a
Pearson correlation coefficient.
3. Results
Between December 2016 and March 2017, we ordered 22
products from 18 unique websites and received 20 products
from 16 sites (Table 1). We ordered 20 products advertised
as mifepristone–misoprostol combination packs and re-
ceived 18. We ordered two products advertised as miso-
prostol alone and received both. Two products that we paid
for but did not arrive — according to package tracking
records — were shipped but could not be delivered to the
home address provided. Despite multiple requests, the
vendors did not resend the products.
None of these sites required a prescription or any medical
documents. Two required completion of an online medical
history questionnaire; none of the questions asked about
gestational age or any of the specific contraindications listed
on the label for Mifeprex®, the brand of mifepristone
approved for abortion by the US Food and Drug
Administration.
3.1. Price, payment and shipping
The charge for the 18 mifepristone–misoprostol products
received, inclusive of shipping and payment fees, ranged
from $110.00 to $360.00 (median $204.50; Table 2). The
two misoprostol-alone products were less expensive. The
median shipping cost for all 20 products received was $25
with a range of $0.00 to $171.00; this included 4 express
shipping charges and 18 standard shipping rates. Payment
options included “E-Check” (a service that required the
buyer to enter a bank account and routing number), wire
transfer, PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, Western Union or
Bitcoin, but sites rarely offered more than two or three of
these options.
The interval between payment and package receipt ranged
from 3 to 21 business days (median 9.5 business days;
Table 2). Sixty-five percent of packages arrived within the
advertised shipping time. Delivery of some packages may
have been delayed because of winter weather at the buyer's
location. One shipment was delayed by the vendor who
believed that the order had been erroneous because the
researcher had at the same time unknowingly also purchased
a product from another website apparently run by the same
vendor. According to package tracking information, 15 of
the products received were shipped from locations within the
United States, and 5 were shipped from locations in India.
All sites provided a contact number or email address. We
contacted most sites at least once between ordering and
receiving the product to check on the status of the order or to
confirm that the package had been shipped.
3.2. Packaging
All pills were packed in blister packs made of foil on both
sides. All 20 products received contained tablets labeled with
the active ingredients ordered, but very few matched the
photo used to advertise the product on the website. Most
288

 blister packages appeared intact (Table 3). Eight
mifepristone–misoprostol products, all from the same
manufacturer, had pinprick-sized holes in each of the five
blisters, and the foil blister was indented. One product, which
contained only misoprostol pills, arrived damaged: 11 of the
20 blisters split open, and some of the pills were broken.
Only two of the blister packs came in boxes, both of which
were printed with a brand name. None of the products came
with instructions or any written communication. Each blister
pack received had the brand name of the product, the amount
of active ingredient per tablet (200 mg for the mifepristone
pills and 200 mcg for the misoprostol pills) and expiration
date stamped on the foil. None of the products were expired.
All but one of the products had a suggested retail price
(inclusive of taxes) stamped on the package, which ranged
from 378.47 rupees to 690.00 rupees ($5.88 to $10.72 in
US dollars). All of the products were labeled as having been
manufactured in India. None of the shipping packages
indicated that the contents were pharmaceutical products or
related to abortion, and three came with other products in the
envelope that were not ordered: two with cell phone charging
cables and one with a necklace.
3.3. Websites
We found evidence that many of the sites were run by the
same vendors. As noted above, one vendor admitted to
having received two orders sent through different websites.
Three purchases from different sites appeared on our credit
card statement as having been paid to a single vendor. Wire
transfers to pay for products from five unique sites were sent
to bank accounts belonging to the same person. Order
confirmations from three sites were sent from the same email
address. Eight products we received were pinpricked in the

 same way, with the blisters folded around the pill. Finally,
two products – ordered by the same researcher from different
URLs days apart – were shipped to the researcher in the
same shipping envelope.
During the ordering process, one website disappeared and
then reappeared several days later. As of May 2017, 14 of the
18 sites ordered from were accessible online and 4 were not.
3.4. Unexpected communications
Two buyers received troubling communications from
product vendors. One warned about the legality of
purchasing online: “Please do not share this info with any
other side because investigation team is searching the details
for this type of medicine.” In the second case, the vendor
complained that he was unable to get payment from the
online payment platform and threatened to withhold
shipment until the buyer paid another way. After some
convincing, he finally sent the product. In addition, one
buyer who paid with Western Union received two fraud alert
calls — one from Western Union advising against
purchasing pharmaceuticals online and another from her
credit card company.
3.5. Assay results
Assays for mifepristone were performed 8–84 days
(median 40.5) after receipt of the pills from the vendor; the
range for the misoprostol assays was 15–91 days (median
47). The analyses revealed that all mifepristone pills received
contained mifepristone in amounts within 8% of 200 mg,
ranging from 184.3 mg to 204.1 mg/pill (Table 3). All
misoprostol pills assayed contained some misoprostol, but
the amount per tablet varied from 34.1 mcg to 201.4 mcg.
The eight pills with the lowest misoprostol content were the
eight Pregnot brand products, manufactured by Akums
Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd., and were also the only eight
with pinpricked packages. Misoprostol content was not
correlated with the interval between package receipt and
assay (p=.88). We ordered from four websites twice and
found that pairs of pills from the same website had similar
amounts of active ingredient.
4. Discussion
Our data indicate that obtaining mifepristone and
misoprostol pills from on-line pharmaceutical websites
without a prescription is feasible in the United States.
Numerous such sites exist and are easily found using
straightforward search terms. Most of the sites we ordered
from allowed standard mechanisms for payment, including
credit cards, Western Union and PayPal. Nearly all of the
pills we ordered arrived. Two thirds of the products came
within 15 days of ordering. The median price paid, about
$200 with all fees and shipping costs included, is lower than
the $504 average cost for a medical abortion in the United
States, not including travel or other secondary costs [3].
Moreover, all of the mifepristone pills contained the
expected amount of mifepristone, and all of the misoprostol
pills contained some misoprostol. Given our findings, we
expect that some people for whom clinic-based abortion is
not easily available or acceptable may consider self-sourcing
pills from the internet to be a rational option.
Although 30% of misoprostol pills contained misoprostol
in amounts within 10% of the labeled dose, the rest had
lower amounts. Low misoprostol content correlated with
both pinholes in the foil blisters containing the pills and with
brand: the eight products with the lowest misoprostol
amounts were also the eight that had pinholes in the blisters
and the eight that were Pregnot brand. Our study did not
determine whether the problem was caused by an initial
manufacturing error or by subsequent degradation possibly
augmented by the pinholes; however, misoprostol's vulner-
ability to degradation when not properly sealed is well
documented [4]. We reached out to the six sites that sent
these products to recommend that, in the future, they should
ensure the integrity of their packaging. Regardless, however,
a substandard misoprostol amount does not necessarily
render a product ineffective for terminating pregnancy.
Notably, abortifacient regimens containing 200 mg mifep-
ristone and 400 mcg misoprostol are recommended by the
World Health Organization for medical abortion through 49
days of gestation [5], and 72% of the mifepristone–
misoprostol packages we received contained these amounts.
While online ordering may offer benefits in terms of
convenience, low cost, and privacy we found some aspects
of the ordering process to be suboptimal. Nearly half of the

 products did not arrive until after the anticipated date. The
products received rarely appeared to be the same brand as
those ordered, and none came with instructions for use.
Some websites disappeared shortly after the order was
placed. The security of the information provided to vendors,
including financial information, was questionable; indeed,
we received fraud alerts and a notification from a vendor
suggesting that an active investigation was ongoing. This
potential lack of security may be a concern to some buyers
given that people in the United States have been prosecuted
for using abortion pills they procured online. Nevertheless,
to some people seeking abortion, these disconcerting
experiences may seem tolerable given the numerous
impediments that they may encounter in obtaining care at a
clinic.
Our study has limitations. Our results represent only a
snapshot of these particular sites, particularly relevant given
the ephemeral nature of the sites. Although our buyers
attempted to act as if they were purchasing products for
personal use, vendors may have recognized that they were
under investigation and thus altered their behavior. Only one
tablet was used in each chemical assay instead of the 20
standard for regulatory-quality testing, reducing the reliabil-
ity of the results. Levels of impurities and other standard
assay parameters were not assessed, and each tablet was not
assessed for substances other than misoprostol and mifep-
ristone. However, the consistency of our data collected by
multiple researchers across numerous websites suggests that
our conclusions are credible.
Although concerns about substandard and falsified
medical products obtained from unregulated websites have
been a focus of intense attention in recent years [6], the scope
and scale of this market and its impact on health are poorly
documented [7,8]. Our study found no evidence that, at the
time of the study, mifepristone and misoprostol products
sold online were dangerous or ineffective. We encourage
reproductive health providers, advocates and policy makers
to think creatively about how the internet might be useful for
enhancing access to safe and effective abortion in the United
States and other similarly disadvantaged settings.
