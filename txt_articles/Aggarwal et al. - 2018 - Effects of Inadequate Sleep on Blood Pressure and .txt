Background-—Insufficient sleep increases blood pressure. However, the effects of milder, highly prevalent but frequently
neglected sleep disturbances, including poor sleep quality and insomnia, on vascular health in women are unclear. We
investigated whether poor sleep patterns are associated with blood pressure and endothelial inflammation in a diverse sample of
women.
Methods and Results-—Women who participated in the ongoing American Heart Association Go Red for Women Strategically
Focused Research Network were studied (n=323, 57% minority, mean age=39�17 years, range=20–79 years). Sleep duration,
sleep quality, and time to sleep onset were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (score ≥5=poor sleep quality). Risk
for obstructive sleep apnea was evaluated using the Berlin questionnaire, and insomnia was assessed using the Insomnia Severity
Index. In a subset of women who participated in the basic study (n=26), sleep duration was assessed objectively using actigraphy,
and endothelial inflammation was assessed directly in harvested endothelial cells by measuring nuclear translocation of nuclear
factor kappa B. Vascular reactivity was measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (n=26). Systolic and diastolic blood
pressure were measured by trained personnel (n=323). Multivariable linear regressions were used to evaluate associations
between sleep patterns and blood pressure, nuclear factor kappa B, and flow-mediated dilation. Mean sleep duration was
6.8�1.3 hours/night in the population study and 7.5�1.1 hour/night in the basic study. In the population study sample, 50% had
poor sleep quality versus 23% in the basic study, and 37% had some level of insomnia versus 15% in the basic study. Systolic blood
pressure was associated directly with poor sleep quality, and diastolic blood pressure was of borderline significance with
obstructive sleep apnea risk after adjusting for confounders (P=0.04 and P=0.08, respectively). Poor sleep quality was associated
with endothelial nuclear factor kappa B activation (b=30.6; P=0.03). Insomnia and longer sleep onset latency were also associated
with endothelial nuclear factor kappa B activation (b=27.6; P=0.002 and b=8.26; P=0.02, respectively). No evidence was found for
an association between sleep and flow-mediated dilation.
Conclusions-—These findings provide direct evidence that common but frequently neglected sleep disturbances such as poor sleep
quality and insomnia are associated with increased blood pressure and vascular inflammation even in the absence of inadequate
sleep duration in women.

nadequate sleep is common, with 28% of the US adult
population reporting ≤6 hours of sleep per night and with
that, a corresponding 24% increased risk of cardiovascular
disease.1–7 Women adopt such behavior in disproportionately
greater numbers in part because of lifelong demands on them
as caregivers, first to their children and later to ailing and/or
elderly family members.8,9 Furthermore, psychosocial factors
may disproportionally impact sleep among women compared
with men. Women are more prone than men to depression,
which is linked to insomnia.10 While the adverse effects of
severe sleep disturbances, such as obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA) and insufficient sleep, on metabolic and vascular health
have recently been recognized in both men and women,11–14
the effects of highly prevalent, milder sleep disturbances,
such as perceived poor sleep quality and insomnia on vascular
health, are not well characterized in women, a population
particularly vulnerable to these conditions.
Emerging evidence suggests sex-specific effects of sleep
duration and latency on blood pressure regulation.15 Sleep
deprivation among women (≤5 hours versus 7 hours/night) is
associated with a greater risk of hypertension (odds ratio:
1.68, 95% confidence interval, 1.39–2.03) than that observed
among men (odds ratio: 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.93–
1.83); however, only 3 out of 23 reviewed studies presented
findings stratified by sex.16–19 Prolonged sleep onset latency
increases the odds of hypertension by 300% (odds ratio: 3.27;
95% confidence interval, 1.20–8.96).20 In addition, OSA, an
independent risk factor for hypertension that is frequently
unrecognized,14 affects 17% of all American women, with even
greater
prevalence
among
postmenopausal
women.21
Remarkably, while women are particularly vulnerable to
inadequate sleep, and rate it as a leading cause of suboptimal
quality of life, they are rarely asked about their sleep habits
and patterns at healthcare encounters.22
Considering the growing evidence suggesting a link
between inadequate sleep and increased cardiovascular risk,
we examined the associations between sleep characteristics,
including sleep quality, insomnia, sleep onset latency, and
OSA risk, with blood pressure in a large, diverse sample of
women encompassing different life stages. Additionally, we
assessed directly whether perceived sleep quality and severity
of insomnia are associated with endothelial inflammation and
dysfunction in the absence of sleep deprivation. We collected
endothelial cells (ECs) from a subset of healthy, young
women, whose sleep duration was measured objectively, to
assess directly whether perceived inadequate sleep and
objectively measured actual sleep duration were associated
with nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFjB), a
marker of endothelial inflammation and a key step in the
initiation and progression of cardiovascular diseases. Direct
assessment of NFkB may provide valuable, precise insight into
early and subtle changes in endothelial function in conditions
that affect systemic vascular endothelium.

Study Population and Design
This study is an analysis of baseline data from an ongoing
population-based prospective cohort of 323 women, aged 20
to 79 years recruited as part of the American Heart Associ-
ation Go Red for Women (AHA GRFW) Strategically Focused
Research Network population study at Columbia University
Medical Center (CUMC AHA GRFW), a novel cohort of women
representing all stages of the adult life cycle. The purpose of
the CUMC AHA GRFW population study is to examine sleep
patterns in relation to cardiometabolic risk factors among
women throughout adulthood. Participants were visitors of
patients at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/CUMC or nearby
hospitals, living in the neighboring communities, or referred to
the study by affiliated physicians. Bilingual staff members
recruited both English- and Spanish-speaking women. All
participants were required to give written informed consent
and the study was approved by the CUMC Institutional Review
Board.
A subset of the women participating in the prospective
cohort study were also screened for eligibility to participate in
the ongoing CUMC AHA GRFW basic science/clinical science
studies (referred to as “basic study”), which examine the
impact of prolonged mild sleep restriction on vascular
endothelial function. Objective measures of habitual sleep
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• We found direct evidence that highly prevalent, relatively
mild sleep disturbances such as poor sleep quality,
prolonged time to fall asleep, and insomnia are associated
with increased blood pressure and vascular inflammation in
women, even in the absence of sleep deprivation.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Our observations extend the relationship between sleep
disorders and cardiovascular risk in women to include
common but frequently neglected sleep disturbances.
• Our findings may strengthen the rationale for systematically
screening women for inadequate sleep in order to prevent
adverse vascular outcomes in this population.

 were obtained using actigraphy as part of the screening
process for this intervention. Inclusion criteria for the basic
study are as follows: (1) sleeping an average of 7 to 9 hours/
night; (2) having a body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 and
33.0 kg/m2 or a BMI 20 to 25 kg/m2 with immediate
family history of obesity, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus;
(3) absence of history of chronic illness; and (4) no medication
use for any chronic condition or hormones. Out of a total of
389 women who were screened, 26 women were enrolled in
the basic study. As part of their participation in the CUMC
AHA GRFW basic study, these women provided EC samples
for NFjB activation assessments and underwent brachial
artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) measurements. Data from
the baseline assessment (before any study intervention) were
analyzed.
Assessment of Sleep Patterns
In the population study, sleep duration and quality were
assessed
using
the
validated
Pittsburgh
Sleep
Quality
Index.23 The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index measures 7
domains including subjective sleep quality, sleep onset
latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep
disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunc-
tion over the last month to distinguish between poor and
good sleepers. A global sum ≥5 indicates poor sleep.24–26
According to the Sleep Research Society/American Academy
of Sleep Medicine consensus statement,27 adequate sleep
should be ≥7 hours/night, while sleeping <7 hours/night is
considered insufficient. The Berlin Sleep Questionnaire was
used to determine the prevalence of a high-risk phenotype
for OSA, using responses to questions about snoring,
daytime somnolence, hypertension, and BMI.28 The presence
of insomnia was ascertained using the Insomnia Severity
Index (ISI) Questionnaire29 and categorized as (1) no clinically
significant insomnia; (2) subthreshold insomnia; (3) clinical
insomnia with moderate severity; or (4) severe clinical
insomnia.
Sleep duration was measured using actigraph GT3X+
monitors (Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) in women enrolled in
the basic study. Monitors were worn on the nondominant
wrist 24 hours/d for 14 days and were only removed to
shower. Mean sleep duration was derived from the ActiLife
software assisted with information on bedtimes and wake
times derived from sleep diaries.
Assessment of Outcomes
Blood pressure
Resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were
assessed in the population study using a hospital-grade
automated blood pressure monitor using a standard protocol
(Omron 5 Series Upper Arm [BP742]).30 Participants were
sitting, legs uncrossed, with arms not restricted by clothing
and relaxed, for at least 5 minutes before measurements
were taken. The participant’s arm was supported at heart
level, with palm up. Trained personnel palpated the brachial
artery, positioned the cuff 1 in above the site of brachial
pulsation, and centered the bladder of the cuff above the
artery. The research grade automated blood pressure monitor
was activated. A minimum of 2 readings were taken at
intervals of at least 1 minute, and the average of those
readings was used to represent the patient’s blood pressure.
If there was a >5 mm Hg difference between the first and
second readings, an additional reading was obtained, and the
average of the 3 readings was used.
Brachial artery FMD
Vascular reactivity of the brachial artery was assessed in the
basic study, in the arm contralateral to the endothelial
harvesting site by FMD according to the guidelines of the
International Brachial Artery Reactivity Task Force.31 Partic-
ipants were evaluated in a quiet, temperature-controlled room
after an overnight fast. After a 30-minute rest in a supine
position, the brachial artery diameter was measured 6 cm
proximal to the antecubital fossa using a 7 to 15 MHz linear
array transducer (Philips 5500, Andover, MA). An occlusion
blood pressure cuff was placed over the proximal forearm just
below the antecubital fossa. FMD was measured as the dilator
response to reactive hyperemia induced by a 5-minute blood
pressure cuff occlusion of the upper arm. The cuff was inflated
to 50 mm Hg above SBP systolic blood pressure if the SBP
was >150 mm Hg, or to 200 mm Hg if the SBP was
<150 mm Hg. SBP was <150 mm Hg in all study partic-
ipants. Resting and peak brachial artery diameter were
measured (expressed in millimeters up to 1 decimal place).
The brachial artery diameter was measured continuously for
2 minutes post cuff release and the maximum dilation within
this period was used to calculate FMD. A blinded reader
analyzed brachial artery diameters off-line using analysis
software. The percent diameter change for FMD was calcu-
lated as follows:
FMD (%)=[(brachial artery diameter at peak hyperemia�di-
ameter at rest)/diameter at rest]9100.
FMD and EC harvesting were performed on the same
morning within 1 hour in all participants. Nitrates were not
administered during FMD to avoid possible effects on
measured EC protein levels in study participants.
EC NFjB activation and inflammation
A 20-gauge angiocatheter was inserted into a superficial
forearm vein in basic study participants. Under sterile
conditions, 3 J-shaped vascular guidewires (Arrow, Reading,
PA) were sequentially advanced into the vein up to 10 cm.

 ECs were retrieved from wire tips by washing with EC
dissociation buffer. Harvesting yielded �2000 to 5000 ECs.
ECs were recovered by centrifugation at 4°C, 150g for
6 minutes, the cell pellet was resuspended in red blood cell
lysis buffer (RBC Lysis buffer, eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and
incubated at 4°C for 5 minutes, then centrifuged at 150g for
6 minutes, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Santa Cruz,
Dallas, TX) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 minutes,
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to
poly-L-lysine-coated slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences,
Hatfield, PA), and air dried at 37°C. The slides were stored at
�80°C until analyzed.32,33
For assessment of NFjB activation in harvested ECs,
permeabilized harvested ECs were identified by positive
staining with goat anti-human polyclonal antibodies directed
against CD144 (VE Cadherin) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN; 1:50) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated
donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoR-
esearch, 1:50). At least 25 consecutive ECs were analyzed
from each slide. Nuclear fluorescence of NFjB was assessed
using confocal microscopy (Nikon A1, Nikon Instruments Inc,
Melville, NY) and ImageJ after staining with rabbit anti-human
antibodies directed against p65 subunit of NFjB (Novus,
Littleton, CO, 1:50) followed by Texas Red–conjugated
donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoR-
esearch, 1:50) and staining with 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylin-
dole (Molecular Probes by Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA).33
Staining for NFjB was performed on the same day in all
study participants and was analyzed within 48 hours of
staining.33
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes intracellular cell
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1 (VCAM-1): We used TaqMan (Life Technology)
method on Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real-time PCR
System. mRNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technology)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. One microgram of
mRNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis with Super-
Script III kit (Life Technology) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The first strand cDNA was further diluted 10 times
with RNase-free water and stored at �80°C. For 20 lL real-
time PCR reactions, the following reagents were added: 10 lL
TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (2X) (Life Technology),
1 lL TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (20X), 5 lL nuclease-
free water, and 4 lL cDNA. This reaction mix was added to
the wells as duplicates for each sample. Real-time PCR
products were run on a 1% agarose gel to confirm the size of
the products. All the real-time PCR primers and probes were
designed to span an exon junction to eliminate the contam-
ination of genomic DNA. TaqMan primers and probes were
used for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Results were expressed as Ct
values normalized to the housekeeping gene b-actin.33
Assessment of Other Covariates
A standardized health questionnaire was used to evaluate
sociodemographic factors including age, race/ethnicity, edu-
cation, employment, and income as well as medical history
including menopausal status, history of chronic illness, and
medication use. Anthropometric measures including height,
weight, and waist circumference were obtained by trained
personnel. BMI, in kg/m2, was calculated from weight and
height.
Statistical Analysis
All data were collected on standardized forms and entered
into a secure RedCap database, then exported to SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) for statistical analyses.
Participant demographic, lifestyle, and medical characteristics
were described using mean�SD for continuous variables and
frequencies for categorical variables. Sleep duration and
quality were evaluated as both continuous and categorical
variables (<7 versus ≥7 hours/night and poor quality sleep
[Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index≥5] versus good quality sleep
[Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index≤5], respectively). Insomnia
was assessed as a continuous variable with ISI scores 0 (no
clinically significant insomnia) to 28 (severe insomnia). OSA
score was assessed as a continuous variable with a score of 0
(low risk) to 3 (high risk). SBP, DBP, NFjB, and FMD were
evaluated as continuous variables. Means, SDs, and ranges
were used to summarize the distributions of each continuous
variable. Pearson correlation coefficient was also used to
calculate the correlation between BMI and NFkB.
Statistical Analysis of the Population Study Data
Linear regressions were used to estimate the bivariate
associations between each pair of outcomes and each covari-
ate. The covariates included the sleep pattern variables, which
were the main covariates of interest, and also a set of potential
confounders including age, BMI, waist circumference, race/
ethnicity, education, marriage, employment status, and insur-
ance type. Wald tests were used to determine the statistical
significance of the bivariate associations at significance level
0.05. All of the covariates that were significant as bivariate
associations were included in a linear model to investigate their
joint association with outcomes. Backward variable selection
was used, in which the most insignificant covariate was
removed one at a time until all the remaining covariates
reached statistical significance at an alpha level of 0.05.
Statistical Analysis of the Basic Study Data
Because of the limited sample size, simple linear regressions
were used to estimate the bivariate associations between

 each pair of clinical outcomes and each of the baseline
covariates. Wald tests were used to determine the statistical
significance of the bivariate associations at a significance level
of 0.05. We also assessed the associations between each
clinical outcome and confounding variables including age, BMI,
waist circumference, race/ethnicity, education, marriage,
employment status, and insurance type. If any of those
variables were significantly associated with a clinical outcome,
we considered them as potential confounders and included
them into the linear model to adjust for the confounding effect.
If a potential confounder was no longer significant in the
expanded model, it was dropped from the model.
Results
Descriptive characteristics of the study populations at
baseline are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 39 years
in the population study, 31 years in the basic study, and one
quarter to one third of the women were married. This was a
racially and ethnically diverse sample with more than half
identifying as a racial and/or ethnic minority (Hispanic
ethnicity and/or racial Black, Asian, American Indian, or
Alaskan Native). Half of the women in the population study
had a BMI >25 kg/m2, compared with 35% in the basic study.
The mean SBP was 118�15 mm Hg in the population study
and 110�14 in the basic study, while the mean DBP was
73�11 and 69�10 mm Hg in the population and basic study,
respectively.

 Assessment of sleep habits showed that the mean self-
reported nightly sleep duration in the population study sample
was 6.8�1.3 hours/night compared with 7.5�1.1 hours/
night in the basic study. Objectively measured sleep duration
was 7.62�0.45 hours/night in the basic study, which was
not different from self-reported sleep duration (P=0.57). Half
of the population study sample reported having poor sleep
quality, including a surprising 25% in the basic study, and 37%
reported having somewhat, moderate, or severe insomnia
(15% “subthreshold insomnia” in the basic study). Based on
the Berlin Sleep questionnaire, the prevalence of a high-risk
profile for OSA (including snoring and other factors) was 17%
in the population study, and none in the basic study. Such
differences in sleep quality and duration between the studies
were expected because of sleep-based inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria in the basic study.
Sleep Patterns and Blood Pressure
In the population study, sleep patterns significantly predicted
SBP and DBP in multivariable-adjusted models (Tables 2 and
3). Significant univariate relations were found between SBP
and sleep quality, insomnia, length of time to fall asleep, OSA
score, employment status, education level, age, waist cir-
cumference, and BMI (P<0.05). Poor sleep quality remained
as a significant predictor of greater SBP in linear regression
models adjusted for age and BMI (b=0.38; P=0.04), after
backward variable selection was used. Similarly, significant
univariate relations were found between DBP and sleep
quality, insomnia, sleep onset latency, OSA risk score,
education level, age, waist size, and BMI (P<0.05). After
backward variable selection was used, age and BMI were
significantly associated with DBP. After adjusting for age and
BMI, greater OSA risk score was not associated with greater
DBP in linear regression models but a nonsignificant trend
was observed (b=�1.38; P=0.08). As expected, the associ-
ation between OSA and DBP was attenuated after adjusting
for BMI, because of the inclusion of BMI as 1 component of
the high-risk phenotype OSA score. The P value of 0.08
suggests that the other factors included in the OSA risk score
have additional independent contributions to DBP.
Sleep Patterns and Endothelial Inflammation and
Function
In the subset of healthy, young women with a normal sleep
duration (defined as 7–9 hours) who were participating in the
basic study, greater ISI score, which indicates more severe
insomnia, was associated with greater nuclear translocation
of NFjB in harvested ECs (b=27.6; P=0.002) (Figure). Poor
sleep quality and longer sleep onset latency were also
associated
with
greater nuclear
translocation of NFjB
(b=30.6; P=0.03 and b=8.26; P=0.02, respectively), also
shown in Figure. After adjusting for BMI, ISI score and sleep
quality remained significantly associated with NFjB (BMI
adjusted b=22.8; P=0.009 and BMI adjusted b=25.3; P=0.04,
respectively). Mean scores (�SD) for participants with poor
versus normal sleep quality are presented using categorical
variables in Table 4. No significant association between
mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes ICAM-1 and
VCAM-1 with perceived sleep quality or ISI score was
observed (ICAM-1 mRNA of sufficient quality was available
for 18 and VCAM mRNA for 10 participants; P=0.14 for the
association between ICAM and sleep quality; P=0.11 for the
association between ICAM and ISI score; P=0.237 for
the association between VCAM and sleep quality; P=0.79
for the association between ICAM and ISI score). Sleep
quality, sleep onset latency, and ISI score were not signifi-
cantly associated with FMD. There was a significant negative
correlation between BMI and NFjB using Pearson’s correla-
tion of �0.51 and the P value was 0.02. The sample Pearson
correlation between FMD and NFjB was �0.22 and was not
significant with P=0.37 (using Fisher Z test).
Discussion
The major findings of this study are that poor sleep quality is
associated with greater SBP in a large, racially and ethnically
diverse sample of women and that perceived poor sleep
quality and insomnia are associated with endothelial inflam-
mation even when objectively measured sleep duration is

 adequate. These findings suggest that perceived inadequate
sleep may increase cardiovascular risk in women.
Although it is well known that severe sleep disorders, such
as OSA, are associated with impaired blood pressure, which
was confirmed in the present study, and increased risk for
incident hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases,14,34
the present study indicates that even milder, more prevalent
sleep disturbances are associated with elevated blood
pressure and evidence of vascular inflammation. Thus, our
observations extend the relationship between sleep disorders
and cardiovascular risk in women to include common but
frequently neglected sleep disturbances such as perceived
poor sleep quality, prolonged time to fall asleep, and insomnia.
Associations between sleep and blood pressure measures
persisted even after adjustment for age and BMI (2 strong,
independent predictors of vascular function). Estimates for
the effect of inadequate sleep on blood pressure in our study
were similar to those for depression, a well-established risk
factor for CVD,35 suggesting that the review of sleep patterns
should be part of the routine healthcare encounter for women.
Insights into inadequate sleep-related endothelial activa-
tion have been derived from indirect measurements of nitric
oxide–mediated arterial vasomotor tone in studies involving
sleep deprivation.36 However, the effects of perceived sleep
quality and insomnia in the absence of sleep deprivation on
endothelial function are less clear. The lack of association
between sleep quality and insomnia score, and brachial artery
FMD in our study in a subset of women who slept more than
7 hours/night is in accordance with previous reports where
FMD has been mostly unaffected by sleep quality in the absence
of curtailed sleep duration.37–40 We tested mRNA expression of
pro-inflammatory genes ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, which are
considered essential for transendothelial migration of mono-
cytes into the arterial wall; however, no significant correlation
with perceived sleep quality or ISI score was observed. This is
likely because of the small sample size of available sufficient
quality mRNA (n=18 and 10 for ICAM and VCAM, respectively).
Additionally, in vivo studies in a large-animal model of
endothelial activation (swine) showed neither histological
evidence of inflammation nor significant differences in the
expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 despite a modest increase in
NFkB measured by Western blot, suggesting that activation of
endothelial inflammation is largely kept in check but with
measurable biochemical evidence of low-level chronic NFkB
activation in these models.41 This suggests that subtle, early
inflammatory changes can be captured directly in a human
sample consisting of several thousand ECs using sensitive
methods, such as immunofluorescence of the individual ECs.
Confocal microscopy is ideally suited for this task because it
provides a precise view of the distribution of NFkB inside EC
compartments. In our ECs, correlation between nuclear
translocation of NFkB, an early marker of pro-inflammatory
transcriptional changes, and parameters of sleep quality
suggests an interaction.
In OSA, a condition associated with disturbed sleep,
endothelial inflammation is present before onset of overt
cardiovascular disease as evidenced by increased nuclear
translocation of NFjB.32,33 Similarly, sleep deprivation acti-
vates NFjB in circulating leukocytes in healthy subjects with an

 effect that is more pronounced in women than men, suggesting
that women may be particularly vulnerable to cardiovascular
pathology
after
sleep
loss.42
The
catecholamine
nore-
pinephrine, whose release is enhanced by increased sympa-
thetic tone, activates NFjB.43 It is possible that increased
sympathetic tone was present in women with poor sleep quality
in our study as evidenced by the significant association
between sleep quality and SBP. Under those circumstances,
elevated blood pressure may contribute to endothelial inflam-
mation, an early event in development of cardiovascular
disease, in women having poor sleep quality, prolonged time
to fall asleep, and insomnia even in the absence of restricted
sleep duration or severe sleep disorders such as OSA. However,
it should be noted that catecholamines and sympathetic nerve
activity were not measured in this study.
The main limitation of this study is that endothelial
inflammation was assessed in venous ECs harvested from
healthy, young women. Local biomechanical forces that affect
arterial ECs at specific sites play an essential role in determining
regional susceptibility to atherosclerosis, and endothelial
biopsy at specific sites of the arterial vasculature will likely be
required to determine the precise mechanisms underlying
atherosclerosis in inadequate sleep. However, venous and
arterial ECs are exposed to the same circulating pro-
inflammatory factors in inadequate sleep. Inflammatory and
oxidative pathways are activated similarly in venous and arterial
ECs in healthy subjects and patients with atherosclerosis.44,45
Furthermore, the cell culturing process rapidly erases arteri-
ovenous gene expression differences that are present in freshly
isolated ECs.46 Thus, direct investigation of easily accessible
freshly isolated human venous ECs without artifact of culture
condition may be particularly useful in conditions associated
with systemic endothelial activation, such as inadequate sleep.
Additionally, FMD is known to be only partially mediated by
inflammation, and our smaller study sample precludes
definitive conclusions regarding correlations between NFjB
and FMD. However, a large study of 2701 participants from
the Framingham Study reported modest, unadjusted inverse
correlations between FMD and soluble markers of systemic
inflammation (C-reactive protein, IL-6, and soluble intracellular
adhesion molecule-1 [sICAM-1]) that were rendered non-
significant after adjustment for traditional coronary risk
factors.47
An additional limitation of this study is the lack of objective
assessments of OSA. However, the subset of women who
underwent EC collection had no risk for OSA as measured by the
Berlin questionnaire, thereby making them unlikely to have
unrecognized severe sleep-disordered breathing. Also, there
were no adjustments for multiple comparisons because of the
small sample size. Finally, the use of 24-hour ambulatory blood
pressure monitoring would have strengthened the assessment
of blood pressure.
In conclusion, our findings provide direct evidence that
highly prevalent, relatively mild sleep disturbances such as
poor sleep quality, prolonged time to fall asleep, and insomnia
are associated with increased blood pressure and vascular
inflammation even in the absence of sleep deprivation. Our
findings may strengthen the rationale for systematically
screening women for inadequate sleep in order to prevent
adverse vascular outcomes in this population.
