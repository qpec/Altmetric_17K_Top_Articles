We have constructed an insect–computer hybrid legged robot using a living
beetle (Mecynorrhina torquata; Coleoptera). The protraction/retraction and leva-
tion/depression motions in both forelegs of the beetle were elicited by
electrically stimulating eight corresponding leg muscles via eight pairs of
implanted electrodes. To perform a defined walking gait (e.g. gallop), different
muscles were individually stimulated in a predefined sequence using a
microcontroller. Different walking gaits were performed by reordering the
applied stimulation signals (i.e. applying different sequences). By varying
the duration of the stimulation sequences, we successfully controlled the step
frequency and hence the beetle’s walking speed. To the best of our knowledge,
this paper presents the first demonstration of living insect locomotion control
with a user-adjustable walking gait, step length and walking speed.
1. Introduction
Small animals, such as insects, have amazing locomotion and they can swiftly
pass through small openings and transverse complex terrains, which has
attracted, stimulated and inspired researchers developing many sophisticated
miniature robots [1–5], but even the state-of-the-art legged robots cannot com-
pete with living insect locomotion, particularly in terms of controllability,
robustness and energy efficiency. As insect physiology has been elucidated to
a great extent, researchers have attempted to control insect locomotion by elec-
trically stimulating certain neuromuscular sites to obtain an insect–computer
hybrid robot or living insect-based robot, for which a living insect is used as
the platform for the robot and the stimulation signals are commanded or
output from the user’s computer. There are demerits and disadvantages in
using an insect platform due to living organisms having a limited lifespan
and a relatively narrow operation temperature range. However, here the
following major engineering and scientific merits are given.
First, unlike man-made legged robots for which many tiny parts, sensors and
actuators are manufactured, assembled and integrated, the insect–computer
hybrid robots directly use living insects as Nature’s ready-made robot platforms.
The only necessary ‘assembly’ or ‘operation’ to create an insect–computer hybrid
robot is to mount a miniature radio device and implant thin wire electrodes into
appropriate neuromuscular sites on the insect for electrical stimulation to induce
the desired motor actions and behaviours.
The second advantage of insect–computer hybrid robots over man-made
robots is their low power consumption rate (a few milliwatts [6,7]). By comparison,
man-made miniature robots of a similar size consume a few hundred milliwatts
[8]. Moreover, owing to advanced biofuel cell technology, the insect–computer
hybrid robot may be self-powered by energy harvesters embedded in the living
insect platform [9–14].
Third, the insect–computer hybrid robot requires neither additional complex
structural design nor complicated locomotion control algorithms. In man-made
robotics research, the kinematic structure design to realize a robust miniature
robot is highly intricate, and the complicated control algorithms for traversing

 complex terrain or maintaining posture have posed numerous
challenges. However, the insect–computer hybrid robot has
developed its own intricate kinematic structure (the motor
neuron network and locomotive appendages) through millions
of years of natural evolution. Furthermore, the insect maintains
its posture in the absence of any control input, negating the
need for complicated control algorithms. When the insect–
computer hybrid robot encounters an obstacle, the user can
simply switch off the controller, allowing the intrinsic neural
control networks of the robot to overcome or avoid the obstacle.
Fourth, studies of the electrical stimulation required to
induce motor action and behaviour contribute not only to the
development of insect–computer hybrid robots, but also to
biological science research to explore animal locomotion. Ani-
mals exhibit a variety of motor actions and behaviours in their
voluntary locomotion (e.g. walking) with a wide dynamic
range or limitation in the locomotion parameters including
speed, step frequency and step length [15–19]. For example,
a cockroach’s step frequency is in the range of 3.7–13.5 Hz in
its voluntary walking [15]. Investigations into the electrical
stimulation required to induce a motor action have suggested
that the physical limit of the muscle, for example the maximum
force generated by the muscle, can be determined by applying
an excessively high-intensity electrical stimulation. In addition,
stimulating multiple muscles in a variety of sequences not only
mimics the animal’s voluntary walking gait but also demon-
strates different gaits unseen in natural walking. For example,
energetic efficiencies and walking speeds under different walk-
ing gaits can be compared to understand whether the
voluntary gait is optimal or not. Such investigations would
be beneficial for the ecological and evolutionary biology of
the insects. Similarly, electrical stimulation studies can reveal
the functions and roles of muscles that cannot be determined
with certainty by classical anatomical studies. For example,
the third axillary muscle, which had previously been thought
to have a role solely in wing folding in Coleoptera, has
since been shown to have another role in left–right turning
in flight through electrical stimulation of the muscle [20].
As such, studies into the electrical stimulation of muscles can
help in investigating the physical limit of muscles, in search-
ing for an optimum walking gait by comparing energetic
efficiencies and in confirming hypothetical muscle functions.
Within the past two decades, many researchers have been
developing animal–computer hybrid robots [6,7,20–45]. Plat-
forms of animal–computer hybrid robots include beetles
(Mecynorrhina torquata) [6,7,20], hawkmoths (Agrius convolvuli
and Manduca sexta) [22–27], cockroaches (Periplaneta Americana
and Gromphadorhina portentosa) [29,31,41–45] and spiders
(Heteropoda venatoria) [46]. In these studies, control was admi-
nistered by neuromuscular stimulation. In the walking
control of cockroaches, researchers incited turning motions
by tactile, thermal or electrical stimulation of the antennae.
Right and left turning by spiders was controlled by neural
stimulation of a ganglion. Although the cockroach and spider
studies demonstrated successful control of the walking direc-
tion, they did not attempt to control the walking speed and
gait. Walking control with such user-adjustable modes and
parameters would improve the agility of the insect–computer
hybrid robot towards practical applications.
In this study, to understand the sequence of leg motions in
an insect’s voluntary walking gait, the detailed leg motions
were tracked by a three-dimensional motion-capturing system
and analysed to obtain the time sequence of each motion.
Then, custom-programmed sequences for leg muscle stimu-
lation to generate different walking gaits and to operate the
sequences using a microcontroller were developed. Next,
the resultant step length and walking speed as a function
of the insect–computer hybrid robot’s step frequency were
obtained and discussed. Lastly, a repeatability test was carried
out on four beetles to obtain the standard deviation of the eli-
cited leg’s angular displacement. Although the ultimate goal
of this research is to control all six legs of an insect, because
our earlier studies enabled us to elicit the desired motor actions
in the front legs of beetle, initially this study has targeted the
front legs alone to control their motions to achieve two-leg-
based walking gaits with adjustable speed and step frequency.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Study animal
Adult M. torquata (order Coleoptera, about two months old, pur-
chased from Kingdom of Beetle Taiwan) were used as the insect
platform for the insect–computer hybrid robot. The beetles were
reared in plastic vivaria of dimensions 15 cm (length) � 15 cm
(width) � 20 cm (height) and fed with sugar jelly every 2–3
days. Each beetle was reared in a single plastic vivarium at con-
stant temperature (approx. 258C) and relative humidity (approx.
60%). Only male beetles 6–8 cm long and weighing around 7 g
were used in the experiments.
2.2. Insect anatomy
The muscles controlling the leg motions were located in an ana-
tomical study of the beetle’s front leg. Prior to the anatomical
study, the beetle was immersed in 95% ethanol solution (Aik
Moh Paints & Chemicals Pte Ltd, Lot 1409T029) for approximately
12 h. The beetle’s cuticle was cut open with micro-dissecting
spring scissors (Vannasw straight scissors with 3 mm cutting
edge, 0.15 mm tip width). The cuticle was then removed with
tweezers (Dumontw tweezer, pattern no. 5, tip size 0.05 �
0.01 mm) to expose the muscles. The front leg muscles stimulated
in the walking control are shown in figure 1. The protraction and
retraction muscles inside the beetle’s prothorax control the protrac-
tion and retraction motions of the front leg (by which the leg
swings forwards and backwards about the thorax–coxa joint;
see figure 1a). The levation and depression muscles inside the
coxa enable levation and depression motions of the femur
(which rotates about the coxa–trochanter joint; see figure 1b).
The retraction and depression muscles are larger than the corre-
sponding protraction and levation muscles, because retraction
and depression are performed when the leg touches the ground;
thus, they execute the power stroke that pushes the body forwards.
The protraction and levation muscles are used when the leg is in
the air, performing the return stroke that brings the leg forwards.
The power stroke requires more main forces than the return stroke.
2.3. Implantation of stimulation electrodes
A pair of stimulation electrodes was implanted into each muscle.
The beetle was fixed onto a wooden block by wrapping softened
dental wax (Cavex Set Up Modeling Wax immersed in 808C
water for 10 s) around its body. Holes of 0.5 mm diameter were
made on the beetle’s cuticle using an insect pin (Indigo Instru-
ments, no. 3 black enamel insect pin) at the sites indicated by red
crosses in figure 1. The stimulation electrodes were thin silver
wires (A-M Systems, diameter ¼ 127 mm without insulation;
178 mm with Teflon insulation coating). The insulation at the end
of the silver wire was removed by flame-heating. To ensure the cor-
rect implantation depth, a metal stopper knot was soldered
approximately 2 mm from the tip of the stimulation electrode.

 The other end of the stimulation electrode was connected to the
output of the stimulation signal-generating circuit.
2.4. Walking gait study
We used a three-dimensional motion-capturing system (figure 2a)
to record the Cartesian coordinates of the beetle’s front tibia
sections with time stamps during voluntary straight line walking.
The
three-dimensional
motion-capturing
system
consists
of
six T40 s VICONw cameras, each with resolution of 4 mega-
pixels (2336 � 1728) operating at 100 frames per second (fps)
(figure 2a1). As shown in figure 2b, each of the beetle’s front tibia
segments was attached with two reflective markers (L1, L2, R1
and R2; MoCap Solutions, 3 mm hemispherical marker) for
motion-capturing purposes. For tracking the beetle’s walking
direction and body orientation, two reflective markers (B1 and
B2; MoCap Solutions, 3 mm hemispherical marker) were attached
to the beetle’s body. The experimental arena was a horizontal
surface of approximately 1 m2. The global reference frame of the
three-dimensional motion-capturing system was set so that its x-
and y-axes formed the horizontal plane parallel to the beetle’s walk-
ing surface. The z-axis was thus perpendicular to the walking
surface. The collected three-dimensional motion data were dis-
played as three independent segments, representing the tibia
segments of the two front legs and the body segment (figure 2c).
The motion data were then exported as comma-separated value
(CSV) files and analysed by custom-programmed MATLABw
codes. Thewalking gaits of five beetles were recorded and analysed.
2.5. Sequential electrical stimulation signals for
walking control
Waves with pulse-width modulation (PWM) were applied to
different muscles at predefined timings to elicit the desired leg
motions for walking control. The PWM stimulation signal was
produced by a custom-programmed microcontroller (Texas Instru-
ments, CC2530, 6 � 6 mm2, 32 MHz clock) and a customized
external circuit. Using the timer interrupt function embedded in
the CC2530 microcontroller, we programmed the pulse width
and frequency of the stimulation signal to be user adjustable.
Figure 3a shows the CC2530 microcontroller connected to the
external circuit for stimulating one muscle. An input/output
(I/O) pin and the ground (GND) pin formed one channel to gen-
erate PWM waves. To stimulate each muscle, one input of an
optocoupler (ISOCOM Components, ISP817X) was connected to
one of the I/O pins (set to output mode); the other was connected
to the GND pin of the microcontroller. Both outputs of the
optocoupler were connected in series with a 1.5 V battery (Sony
Corporation, dry battery, AA R6 SUM3) and the target muscle.
For fast release of the residual charge in the optocoupler, a 470 V
resistor (Multicomp, wirewound, 3 W) was connected in parallel
with the muscle to be stimulated. In this configuration, the opto-
coupler functioned as a switch in the muscle stimulation circuit
(figure 3a). The I/O pins of the CC2530 microcontroller were
used as the on–off controls of the optocoupler and to power the
light-emitting diode (LED) in the external circuit as an indicator
of muscle stimulation status. The PWM waves with 1 ms pulse

 width and 1.5 V amplitude are set to elicit muscle contraction (and
the corresponding leg motion) [6]. The main function of the micro-
controller code for the walking control is shown in the electronic
supplementary material, code S1; additional information on the
code is available upon request.
The protraction/retraction muscles (by which the leg swings for-
wards and backwards in the frontal plane) and the levation/
depression muscles (by which the leg lifts from and lowers onto
the walking surface) of the front legs were stimulated sequentially
for walking control. Therefore, eight stimulation channels were
used to separately control the four motion types of the two front
legs, and all other leg motions were restricted by inserting insect
pins at the leg joints. The coxa of the middle leg was restricted at
its maximum retraction angle to avoid blocking the front leg when
the front leg performed retraction. Figure 3b shows the implanted
insect–computer hybrid robot. Various alternating tripod walking
gaits are adopted by around 3 million species of insects [47], and
very recently a galloping walking gait was discovered in the species
of flightless desert dung beetles (Pachysoma) [48]. In the tripod walk-
ing gait of a six-legged insect, one leg always moves out of phase
with its contralateral pair (i.e. the middle leg on one side moves syn-
chronously with the contralateral front leg and hind leg). On the
other hand, in a galloping walking gait, the legs of a pair always
move synchronously (in-phase). As only the two front legs were
electrically stimulated and involved in the walking gait while the
middle and hind legs were constrained (pined), the walking gaits
demonstrated are technically neither tripod nor galloping. For con-
venience, we named the two walking gaits of our insect–machine
hybrid robot as tripod and galloping. In real life, a six-legged
insect was also observed to move exclusively with two legs.
The cockroach (Periplaneta americana) was recorded propelling
itself only with two hind legs by increasing its body’s angle
of attack during fast running (running speed above 1 m s21) [17].
For our insect–computer hybrid robot, as we can control the
individual motions of each leg, the locomotion gait can be more
user-adjustable than the case when some sensory pathway
(e.g. antenna, ganglion) is stimulated, in which the induced
locomotion control is based on the insect’s natural walking.
2.6. Investigating the effect of step frequency on the
walking speed and step length in the tripod and
galloping walking gaits
As both the walking gait and step frequency of the insect–
computer hybrid robot are user adjustable, we experimentally
investigated the effect of step frequency on the beetles’ walking
speed and step length in both gaits (tripod and galloping). The
walking control experiment was conducted on an exterior poly-
styrene foam arena with dimensions of 120 cm (length) � 60 cm
(width) � 5 cm (height). A camera (Panasonicw HC-X920M, 20.4
megapixels, 25 fps) was fixed above the beetle and perpendicu-
lar to the horizontal walking surface. For calibration purposes, a
30 cm ruler was placed parallel to the beetle’s walking path. Six
beetles were filmed during tripod and galloping walking at differ-
ent step frequencies (2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 Hz). The beetles were
tested on the same day as they were implanted. The walking speed
study yielded 90 data points (nine for each step frequency in each
walking gait). Moreover, at each step frequency and walking gait,
the average walking speed was calculated from five continuous
steps (excluding the first and last steps), providing 150 data
points for the step length analysis (75 each from the left and
right legs). The walking control films were manually extracted
frame by frame using the Avidemux 2.6w video editor. The
extracted pictures were then opened in Microsoftw Paint and
manually analysed pixel by pixel. As shown in figure 4, the step
length was obtained by measuring the distance between consecu-
tive anterior extreme positions (AEPs) of the front leg [49]. The
pixel coordinates at the articulation connecting the tibia and
tarsus indicate the leg’s contact point with the ground (red crosses
on the left leg in figure 4). The instant at which the leg reached its
AEP was determined from the LEDs, indicating the signal output
of the stimulated walking control (at the AEP, the protraction and
depression muscles were simultaneously stimulated just before the
stimulation switched from the protraction to retraction muscles;
the details are presented in table 1).
2.7. Repeatability study of leg motion elicitation
To test the repeatability of electrically induced leg motion, the
protraction/retraction muscles of the front leg were alternatively
stimulated for 1 s to elicit the cycle of protraction and retraction
motions of the fore leg: the channel for the protraction muscle
stimulation was turned on for 1 s, then that channel was
turned off and another channel for retraction muscle stimulation
was turned on for 1 s (thus, the frequency was 0.5 Hz). The cycle
was repeated for at least 30 min per day for 7 consecutive days.
The leg’s motions were tracked and recorded using the same
technique as described in §2.4. Two-factor analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was conducted at the 95% confidence level to quanti-
tatively evaluate the significance of the effects of the beetle and
test day on the mean and standard deviation of the leg’s angular
displacement. All statistical analyses were performed using
Microsoftw Excel 2010.

1.5 V battery (for power supply for muscle stimulation). Channels 1–8 separately controlled the eight identical external circuits that stimulated the eight muscles in

 3. Results and discussion
3.1. Walking gait study
To study the front leg motion of the beetle, we constructed a
stick diagram of the tibia segment at different times (figure 5)
[49]. Here, we used the motion data of free movement in a
straight line. Figure 5 illustrates the lateral view of the
motion trajectory of the front tibia segment. As the camera
frame rate of motion capture was set to 100 Hz, any two con-
secutive sticks are 10 ms apart. The horizontal axis indicates
the distance travelled by the tibia segment along the beetle’s
walking direction. For example, if the beetle travelled along
the x-axis of the global reference frame (i.e. the y-coordinates
of the two markers on its body remained constant), the hori-
zontal axis of figure 5 would coincide with the x-axis of the
global reference frame. The vertical axis of figure 5 indicates
the vertical distance travelled by the front tibia segment
(which coincides with the z-axis of the global reference
frame). The blue and red sticks in figure 5 represent the
anterior extreme positions (AEPs) and posterior extreme pos-
itions (PEPs), respectively, of the beetle’s front leg. When the
motion progresses from a blue stick to a consecutive red stick,
the leg is performing a power stroke (a retraction that swings
the leg backwards relative to the body). Conversely, when the
motion progresses from a red stick to a consecutive blue stick,
the leg is performing a return stroke (a protraction that
swings the leg forwards relative to the body). Moreover, an
increase or a decrease of the marker’s vertical position indi-
cates that the leg is being levated or depressed, respectively.
During voluntary walking, the power and return strokes
were repeated. The four motion types (protraction, retraction,
levation and depression) were performed with different tim-
ings, generating cyclic leg motions. The duration of each
motion type was extracted from figure 5 by counting the
number of sticks involved in that motion (as mentioned
above, the time interval between two consecutive sticks was
10 ms). A complete walking step is defined as the duration
between two consecutive AEPs [49]. Figure 6 shows the dur-
ation of the four motion types of the front leg, normalized by
the
corresponding
step
period
(number
of
beetles ¼ 5,
number of steps ¼ 25). The average duration of a complete
walking step was 900+600 ms (mean+s.d., corresponding
to a step frequency of 1.66+0.93 Hz). Retraction and
depression were executed concurrently in the power stroke
and occupied the first 61+22% of a complete walking step
(red and green bars in figure 6). The return stroke comprised

(indicated by the red cross on the horn). The pixel distance between AEP 1 and AEP 2 was calculated by Pythagoras’ theorem. The pixel distance was then converted
to the actual distance (in centimetres) travelled by the leg by calibration with a 30 cm ruler.

 protraction, levation and depression. Protraction was executed
throughout the return stroke, whereas levation was converted
to depression at 78+15% of the normalized step duration.
Similar leg motion sequences have been observed in the
firing sequence of the motor neurons during middle leg
motions of a voluntary walking stick insect [50]. In that
study, the motor neuron pools controlling the retraction and
depression were activated during the power stroke, whereas
the motor neuron pools controlling the protraction (levation
and depression) were activated during the return stroke (in
the early and late phases, respectively) [50]. The step length
was normalized by the beetle’s body length. The average
step length of voluntary walking was 0.24+0.08 body
length (mean+standard deviation, number of beetles ¼ 5,
number of steps ¼ 25).
3.2. Leg motion and walking gait control
A full walking step of a legged robot involves a power stroke
and a return stroke [51]. From the walking gait study, we rep-
resented the durations of the four leg motion types as
proportions of the entire duration of a walking step (figure 6).
In the actual walking control of the beetle, we imposed protrac-
tion and levation only during the return stroke and equalized
the durations of the return and power strokes. These specifica-
tions simplified the leg motions and therefore the walking
analysis (step frequency and step length analysis). As such, in
the actual walking control, the power stroke starts from the
AEP when the leg performs both retraction (for the backward
swing) and depression (for the ground contact), generating
the forward propulsion for the body. At the end of the power
stroke, the leg is brought to the PEP and the depression switches
to levation. During the succeeding return stroke, the leg per-
forms both protraction (for the forward swing) and levation
(lifting the leg from the ground). At the end of the return
stroke, the leg is brought back to the AEP and the levation
switches to depression. The resulting leg motion control con-
sists of cyclic repetitions of these power and return strokes.
The leg muscle stimulation sequence is shown in table 1. In
both gaits (tripod and galloping), stimulation sequence 1 of
the right leg control consists of protraction and levation for
the return stroke. The leg is then switched from the return
stroke to the power stroke by activating protraction and
depression in stimulation sequence 2. Stimulation sequence 3
consists of retraction and depression for the power stroke.
Finally, the power stroke is switched to the return stroke in
stimulation sequence 4, which simultaneously elicits retraction
and levation. Stimulation sequences 1–4 were repeated in both
gaits to generate cyclic power and return strokes. However, in
the tripod walking control, the muscles stimulated in the left
leg were always antagonistic to those stimulated in the right
leg. In the galloping control, the muscles of both front legs
were stimulated in the same stimulation sequence, so that
both legs always performed the same motions at the same
time. Figure 7a,b illustrates the elicited leg motions during the
stimulation
sequences
of
tripod
and
galloping
control
(table 1), respectively. Figure 7 shows the ventral view of the
beetle for clear demonstration of the leg motion control. Com-
pared with antenna stimulation in the cockroach [29,41–45]
and ganglion stimulation in the cockroach and spider [31,46],
appendage muscle stimulation enabled user-adjustable walk-
ing gait and step frequency control. However, whereas just
two pairs of electrodes were used for the antenna or ganglion
stimulation, eight pairs of electrodes are necessary for the
two-leg-based walking control of this study. In order to per-
form the entire six-leg-based walking control in reality,
reducing the number of stimulation electrodes would reduce
the tediousness of implantation, for example by setting a coun-
ter (GND) electrode to be commonly used for all the working
(I/O) electrodes would reduce the number of implanted
stimulation electrodes by half.
3.3. Walking speed and step length analysis
Besides controlling the walking gait, we aimed to control the
step frequency and thereby the walking speed of the beetle.
The step frequency was controlled by altering the durations
of the stimulation sequences in table 1 and investigating the
resultant walking speeds of the insect–computer hybrid
robot. In both tripod and galloping gaits, we set the stimulation
durations of each sequence to 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 or 2 s, corre-
sponding to step frequencies of 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 Hz,

(protraction, retraction, levation and depression) were performed at different
timings to generate the cyclic power and return strokes during voluntary
walking. First, retraction and depression (red and green bars, respectively)
were executed concurrently during the power stroke (comprising the first
61 + 22% of a complete walking step). During the following return

(orange bar) was switched to depression (purple bar) at 78 + 15% of
the normalized step duration.

 respectively (recall that sequences 1–4 constitute a single walk-
ing step). Figure 8 plots the relationship between the
normalized walking speed (body lengths per second) and the
step frequency of six beetles. Each walking speed was averaged
from five continuous steps (excluding the first and last steps).
As evident in the figure, the average normalized walking
speed was always higher in the galloping gait than in the
tripod gait, for all the step frequencies tested. This is because
in the tripod gait, where the two front legs move out of
phase, the leg performing the power stroke not only propels
the body forwards but also turns the body in the contralateral
direction. In the galloping gait, the two front legs move syn-
chronously, pushing the body straight ahead during the
power stroke. Therefore, at a given step frequency, the average
step length (normalized by the body length of the correspond-
ing beetle) was larger during galloping than during tripod
walking (figure 9). As such, the galloping gait propelled the
body more efficiently than the tripod gait, and the insect–
computer hybrid robot walked faster in the galloping gait
than in the tripod gait at the same step frequency.
In both gaits, the average normalized walking speed of the
robot increased with increasing step frequency up to 1 Hz, and
then decreased after further doubling the step frequency to
2 Hz (figure 8). The walking speed was maximized at 0.26
body lengths per second (2.00 cm s21) in the galloping gait at
a step frequency of 1 Hz. In walking speed studies of a
man-made robot [52] and a voluntary walking animal [15],
the walking speed was observed to be directly proportional
to the step frequency. In other words, for a constant step
length, the walking speed would double with each doubling
of the step frequency. However, in this study, the normalized
walking speed was a nonlinear function of the step frequency
(despite being an increasing function of the step frequency
up to 1 Hz). For instance, when the step frequency was
doubled from 0.125 to 0.250 Hz, the average normalized walk-
ing speed increased by 77% in both tripod and galloping gaits.
Our results can be explained as follows: a higher step frequency
reduces the stimulation duration in each sequence, leading to
smaller angular displacement of the leg and hence a shorter
step length. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in [6].
Therefore, we further investigated the robot’s step length at
different step frequencies (figure 9). In general, the robot’s aver-
age normalized step length decreased with increasing step
frequency (because the stimulation duration was shorter),
except when the step frequency was doubled from 0.25 to
0.5 Hz. For instance, when the step frequency was doubled
from 1 to 2 Hz, the average normalized step length was
reduced by 55% and 53% during tripod and galloping walking,
respectively (in other words, for both gaits, the average nor-
malized step length at 2 Hz was less than half of that at

speed study yielded 90 data points (nine data points per step frequency in

counted) were used to obtain one average walking speed data point. The
black bars indicate the standard deviations. For a given step frequency,
the insect–computer hybrid robot progressed faster during galloping than
during tripod walking. In both gaits, the average normalized walking
speed increased with each doubling of the step frequency from 0.125 to
1 Hz, and then decreased from 1 to 2 Hz. The blue and red numbers indicate
the percentage change of the average normalized walking speed at each dou-
bling of the step frequency during tripod and galloping walking, respectively.

 1 Hz). Therefore, doubling the step frequency from 1 to 2 Hz
reduced the average normalized walking speed by 14% and
15% during tripod and galloping walking, respectively. In
summary, changing the stimulation duration of each sequence
affects both the step frequency and step length.
If the step frequency is further doubled from 2 to 4 Hz
(corresponding to a stimulation duration of 62.5 ms in each
sequence), the beetles could not progress in either gait, because
the leg could not reach sufficient angular displacement for
effective walking control within 62.5 ms. The angular displace-
ment as a function of time in all six front leg motions (namely,
protraction/retraction, levation/depression and extension/
flexion) has been investigated at stimulation frequencies
ranging from 10 to 100 Hz (in 10 Hz increments) and a stimu-
lation amplitude of 1.5 V [6]. During protraction, levation and
depression at 100 Hz, the leg approached its maximum angular
displacement in 0.2–0.25 s. If the stimulation duration is very
short (e.g. 62.5 ms at 4 Hz), the angular displacement of the
leg is too small to initiate walking. When the leg could not be
lifted from the ground during levation, it maintained contact
with the ground at all times. Consequently, the beetle moved
back and forth with its two front legs remaining at the same
ground contact positions.
The range of step length of the insect–computer hybrid
robot (min: 0.09+0.02, max: 0.39+0.09 body length as in
figure 9) covers the voluntary walking’s step length (0.24+
0.08 body length), which indicates that the insect–computer
hybrid robot demonstrated the wider walking speed control
and achieved both faster and slower walking than intact bee-
tles. The average step frequency of the voluntary walking
beetle is 1.66+0.93 Hz, while the step frequency demon-
strated in this study ranges from 0.125 to 2.00 Hz. Step
frequency over 2.00 Hz was not usable because the stimulation
duration is too short to induce sufficient contraction in the leg
muscles. By increasing the stimulation frequency (which was
set at constant in this study), the maximum step frequency
for sufficient contraction can be increased [6], and, then, the
walking speed is also increased. In fact, a cockroach increases
the walking speed linearly with step frequency (constant step
length). Once the step frequency reaches the maximum attain-
able value, the cockroach then increases the step length to
further increase the walking speed [15]. The insect–computer
hybrid robot has the same strategy (altering the step frequency
and step length) to widely control the walking speed as both
the step frequency and step length are user adjustable.
3.4. Repeatability of leg motions
Compared with man-made robots and actuators, when the same
control input is applied repeatedly, the variances or errors in
motor actions of electrically stimulated muscles (hence the
induced appendage motion amplitude) is relatively large
(figures 8–11) due to biological experimental factors such as
individual animal difference and implanted electrode drift.
However, the levels of variances and errors in muscle motor
actions themselves are mostly less than 20% as in the standard
deviations, which indicates the repeatability in the insect–
computer hybrid robot. If the repeatability is low, there would
be an increase, decrease, abrupt jump or cessation in motor
action but, as shown in figure 10, the angular displacement
(the length between the green and red plots) did not largely
change throughout the trial. In addition, ANOVA test results
showed that there was no clear day-by-day or animal-to-
animal difference in the mean angular displacement (F6,18 ¼
0.67, p ¼ 0.67 for test day effect; F3,18 ¼ 1.82, p ¼ 0.18 for beetle
effect) or in the standard deviation (F6,18 ¼ 0.82, p ¼ 0.57 for
test day effect; F3,18 ¼ 2.83, p ¼ 0.07 for beetle effect). The vari-
ation in the mean and standard deviation of the leg’s angular
displacement with respect to the individual beetle and test day
is also shown in figure 11. We thus conclude that the insect–
computer hybrid robot can repeatedly demonstrate desired
and expected performances, i.e. the walking speed and step
lengtharecontrollablebythestep frequencyas shown in figures 8
and 9. The relatively large variance (standard deviation of the
order of 20%) does not strongly affect the walking performances.
Such a large variance should be problematic in more sophisti-
cated and precise locomotion control, for example regulating
individual legs in pre-determined motion paths. In that case,
closed-loop (feedback) control coupled with leg motion detec-
tion should be adopted for the insect–computer hybrid robot [6].
Also the small fluctuation in the variance level implies
that the animal’s voluntary motor action did not significantly

the extreme retraction and protraction positions every second due to the
applied electrical stimulation. The difference between adjacent retraction
and protraction positions is the leg’s angular displacement.

the animal voluntarily disturbed the electrically induced motor
action and it strongly influenced the resultant displacement,
the angular displacement shown in figure 10 would be
abruptly changed, but such a large change was not seen in
the data.
5. Conclusion
We demonstrated that M. torquata beetles can be controlled to
walk in tripod and galloping gaits with predefined stimu-
lation sequences (table 1). By altering the step frequency,
we adjusted the step length and walking speed of the beetles.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
of living insect locomotion control with user-adjustable walk-
ing gaits, step lengths and walking speeds. With the 100%
success rate of leg motion elicitation, the insect–computer
hybrid robot demonstrated here is more reliable than those
controlled by stimulation of neurons where habituation
exists (e.g. antenna or ganglia). Moreover, compared with
existing insect–computer hybrid robots in which the control
of walking speed and gait is impossible, the ability to moni-
tor the robot’s walking speed and walking gait would enable
it to complete more complicated tasks. Such regulation of the
beetle’s leg motions at predefined sequences and durations
should significantly contribute to the future development of
animal–computer hybrid robots. For instance, we could con-
trol the middle and hind legs of the beetle or regulate the
appendage motions of other animals such as cockroaches
and dragonflies for legged robots and unmanned aerial
micro-vehicles. Furthermore, the stimulation protocol demon-
strated can benefit biological research in the field such as
testing the physical limit of muscles, comparing the energy
efficiency of different walking gaits and confirming the
hypothetical functions of muscles.
