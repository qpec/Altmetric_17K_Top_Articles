Summary
Background Early HIV diagnosis reduces morbidity, mortality, the probability of onward transmission, and their 
associated costs, but might increase cost because of earlier initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART). We investigated 
this trade-off by estimating the cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in primary care.
Methods We modelled the effect of the four-times higher diagnosis rate observed in the intervention arm of the 
RHIVA2 randomised controlled trial done in Hackney, London (UK), a borough with high HIV prevalence 
(≥0·2% adult prevalence). We constructed a dynamic, compartmental model representing incidence of infection and 
the effect of screening for HIV in general practices in Hackney. We assessed cost-effectiveness of the RHIVA2 trial by 
fitting model diagnosis rates to the trial data, parameterising with epidemiological and behavioural data from the 
literature when required, using trial testing costs and projecting future costs of treatment.
Findings Over a 40 year time horizon, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were £22 201 (95% credible interval 
12 662–132 452) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, £372 207 (268 162–1 903 385) per death averted, and 
£628 874 (434 902–4 740 724) per HIV transmission averted. Under this model scenario, with UK cost data, RHIVA2 
would reach the upper National Institute for Health and Care Excellence cost-effectiveness threshold (about £30 000 
per QALY gained) after 33 years. Scenarios using cost data from Canada (which indicate prolonged and even higher 
health-care costs for patients diagnosed late) suggest this threshold could be reached in as little as 13 years.
Interpretation Screening for HIV in primary care has important public health benefits as well as clinical benefits. We 
predict it to be cost-effective in the UK in the medium term. However, this intervention might be cost-effective far sooner, 
and even cost-saving, in settings where long-term health-care costs of late-diagnosed patients in high-prevalence regions 
are much higher (≥60%) than those of patients diagnosed earlier. Screening for HIV in primary care is cost-effective and 
should be promoted.

Introduction
Increased testing for HIV is crucial to the identification 
of the large numbers of people living with HIV who are 
as yet undiagnosed. Perhaps as many as half of the 
2·3 million people living with HIV in Europe and up to 
a sixth of the 1·1 million in the USA are undiagnosed.1,2 
In the UK, where an estimated 13% (n=13 500) of 
people living with HIV are undiagnosed,3 recent 
recommendations propose expansion of existing 
testing provision to offer routine testing of all adults in 
high-prevalence (≥0·2%) areas.4–7 Most testing remains 
concentrated in sexual health and antenatal clinics.8
Treatment for HIV is expensive and its initiation is 
being recommended progressively earlier in the course 
of infection owing to increased recognition of the 
benefits of starting earlier treatment.9 Increased testing 
therefore has the potential to increase treatment 
costs. Health-care planners need reliable estimates of 
cost-effectiveness of screening but estimates are 
few and have not yet been based on data from 
randomised control trials of screening interventions.10–12 
We have previously reported the first randomised 
controlled trial assessing the effect of HIV screening 
in general practice (RHIVA2),13 showing increased 
and possibly earlier detection of HIV. Our trial 
was pragmatic in design and covered a large inner-
London primary care population, providing a real-life 
picture of the effect of screening. Its cost-effectiveness 
should be evaluated to ensure resources are optimally 
allocated.14
We calculated the costs of screening and, using a 
cost-effectiveness model of HIV testing for the trial 
setting fitted to trial data, we evaluated the costs, 
benefits, and cost-effectiveness of this intervention. We 
took account of the increased diagnosis rate and benefits 
to the population of reduced HIV transmission through 
earlier diagnosis. We also compared the cost savings of 
averting HIV infections with the costs accrued by the 
intervention and by earlier initiation of HIV treatment 
for diagnosed patients.

Methods
Data sources
RHIVA2 
was 
set 
in 
Hackney, 
a 
multiethnic, 
socioeconomically deprived inner London borough with 
a prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection of 0·8% 
(eight of 1000 adults).15 The intervention involved 
training of practices to integrate opt-out rapid point-of-
care HIV testing into the practice registration health 
check. For rapid testing, the INSTI HIV1/HIV2 Rapid 
Antibody Test (bioLytical Laboratories, Richmond, BC, 
Canada) finger prick system was used (sensitivity 99·6%, 
specificity 99·3%). Most (40 [89%]) of the 45 general 
practices in Hackney took part.
HIV diagnosis rates in intervention (20 practices with 
44 971 new registrants) and control (20 practices with 
38 464 new registrants) practices over the 28 month 
trial duration informed the cost-effectiveness model. 
Intervention practices newly diagnosed 32 people living 
with HIV compared with 14 in control practices. The 
overall rate of HIV diagnosis was four times higher in 
the intervention group than in the control group: 0·30 
(95% CI 0·11-0·85) per 10 000 patients per year in 
intervention practices versus 0·07 (0·02–0·20) in control 
practices. Mean CD4 count at diagnosis was 356 cells per μL 
(SD 254) in intervention versus 270 (SD 257) in control 
practices. Full details of the intervention, study design, 
and analysis are available.13
Costs for the RHIVA2 intervention were estimated 
with standard methods, in which the mean use of a 
resource was multiplied by the unit cost of that resource 
to produce the estimated direct mean cost incurred by 
the intervention.16 The analysis was done from the 
perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and 
thus only considered costs directly incurred by the NHS; 
overhead costs were not included.
Direct start-up and recurrent costs for the RHIVA2 
intervention were collected by the RHIVA2 team. Each 
participating surgery was offered a £300 (US$484) 
enrolment incentive. Additionally, an incentive of 
£10 ($16·14) was offered for each rapid HIV test done 
(intervention only).
We annualised start-up costs over the lifetime of the 
programme to reflect utility beyond the period of the 
trial (duration 28 months). Using our best judgment 
as managers of the RHIVA2 intervention and our 
experience of working within the NHS, we estimated 
programme lifetime to be 5 years.
When necessary, we adjusted the price of commodities 
(eg, HIV rapid test, confirmatory tests) by inflation to 
reflect the year of the costing analysis, 2012. Costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at a 
rate of 3·5% per year. We used an average annual 
exchange rate of $1·6143 per £1 for 2012 as calculated by 
OANDA but this rate has changed substantially in recent 
years ($1·29448 per £1 as of July 7, 2017). Further details 
of costing are in the appendix (p 1).
We took quality of life estimates by CD4 cell count 
band and diagnosis and treatment status from the 
scientific literature (appendix pp 16–18). We calculated 
QALYs gained by the intervention by comparing total 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Screening for HIV is recommended in national guidelines in the 
USA, Canada, and the UK, but cost-effectiveness of various 
screening and testing approaches is unclear. RHIVA2 was the 
first randomised controlled trial of HIV screening in primary care. 
The intervention quadrupled the HIV diagnosis rate. Calls have 
been made by public health and primary care physicians, as well as 
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, for its 
cost-effectiveness to be evaluated, to ensure limited resources are 
appropriately employed. We searched PubMed for studies 
published from inception up to May 31, 2017, estimating the 
cost-effectiveness of primary care-based HIV screening 
interventions, and including effects on onward transmission. We 
combined search terms for HIV screening (“HIV”, “screening”, and 
“testing”) with health economic terms (“cost-effectiveness”, “cost 
effectiveness”, “ICER”, “cost–benefit”, “cost benefit”, “cost–utility”, 
“cost utility”, “health economics”) and “transmission”. We found 
just one relevant study, screening for HIV in community-based 
settings in the USA, but screening was for acute HIV infection only.
Added value of this study
We report the first health economic modelling study informed 
by real-world data from a randomised controlled trial of 
primary care-based screening for all HIV infections. We include 
the costs accrued from earlier treatment of individuals who 
have been diagnosed earlier. By taking account of the full cost 
implications of the intervention, this study illustrates how a 
successful primary care-based HIV screening intervention, 
resulting in increased diagnosis rates, becomes cost-effective in 
the medium term (33 years) or sooner.
Implications of all the available evidence
General practice-based HIV screening leads to increased and 
probably earlier diagnosis of HIV, which improves the length 
and quality of life of people who are HIV positive and might 
reduce onward transmission. Primary care-based HIV 
screening becomes cost-effective over the medium term 
according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
criteria, under current UK HIV treatment cost estimates. Using 
findings from Canada of long-term higher health-care costs 
for patients diagnosed late, our model predicts RHIVA2 will 
become a cost-effective intervention far sooner and even to 
become cost saving.

QALYs of the model population (ie, the population of 
Hackney) under the control scenario with total QALYs 
under the intervention scenario. We estimated QALYs as 
the product of the utility estimate assigned to each model 
compartment and the average duration that an infected 
individual remains in that compartment.
HIV-related health-care cost data used in the model 
included costs of antiretroviral treatment (ART) and 
CD4, viral load, and resistance testing, as well as use of 
health-care services (appendix pp 3, 19). Little 
information is available on how long-term HIV health-
care costs are related to CD4 cell count at diagnosis. 
Therefore, we explored three plausible scenarios in 
which patients diagnosed with late infection have 
increased health-care costs. Scenario 1 is based on UK 
data17 and models 25% higher costs for long-term 
diagnosed (ie, patients in long-term HIV care after the 
first year of diagnosis) patients on ART who were 
diagnosed at CD4 counts of 200 cells per μL or less. 
Scenarios 2 and 3 are based on data from Canada18 
where those diagnosed at CD4 counts of 350 cells per μL 
or less had direct medical costs 1·6 times higher than 
did other patients, up to 15 years after diagnosis. 
Scenario 2 assumes 1·6-times higher costs for long-
term diagnosed who were diagnosed at 350 cells per μL 
or less. Scenario 3 assumes 1·6-times higher costs for 
all long-term diagnosed who were diagnosed at CD4 
counts of 350 cells per μL or less, but costs for those 
diagnosed at counts of 200 cells per μL or less are twice 
those of patients diagnosed at counts of 200–349 cells 
per μL. In each case, we calculated weights so that total 
costs of all long-term diagnosed are the same as in 
scenario 1. We report scenario 1 results as our base case 
because it is based on UK data. We also explored 
scenarios in which ART costs reduce with future drug 
price reductions after patent expiry. Further information 
on health-care costs is provided in the appendix 
(pp 4–5, 19).
Cost-effectiveness model
We developed a dynamic, compartmental model to 
represent the HIV epidemic and the effect of screening 
within the borough of Hackney. The model was 
parameterised with epidemiological and behavioural 
data, some of which were obtained from a previous 
cost-effectiveness model of HIV screening in the UK19

Background death rate is applied to each compartment but, for clarity, is not shown. Numbers refer to stages of HIV infection: 1=acute infection; 2=CD4 count of 
more than 500 cells per μL; 3=CD4 count of 350–500 cells per μL; 4=CD4 count of 200–349 cells per μL; and 5=CD4 count of less than 200 cells per μL. Diagnosis 
rate for compartment 1 is assumed to be zero (ie, no diagnoses occur during acute infection). Model assumed diagnosis upon progression to AIDs (appendix p 3).

and HIV infection progression rates by CD4 cell count 
band taken from a recent modelling study of ART.20
The model defines HIV infection progression according 
to five stages, the first representing the short period of 
acute infection after HIV acquisition, and the remaining 
four defined by the following CD4 count bands: more 
than 500 cells per μL (not acute), 350–500 cells per μL, 
200–349 cells per μL, and less than 200 cells per μL 
(figure 1). The state variables and transmission equations 
for the model are shown in the appendix (pp 1–3).
We defined three phases of infection: undiagnosed, 
diagnosed short-term (representing the first year after 
diagnosis), and diagnosed long-term (time thereafter). 
Quality of life estimates are lower during the first year 
after diagnosis compared with subsequent years, and so 
time diagnosed is divided into a first phase averaging 
1 year and a long-term phase thereafter.
After diagnosis, individuals are assumed to have a long 
life expectancy because of effective treatment and care, 
and reductions in HIV infectiousness are assumed to 
result from ART-induced reductions in viral load.21 For 
each behavioural risk group, we assigned an average 
number of partners per year for those undiagnosed. As 
used previously,19 we assumed that once these individuals 
are diagnosed, they permanently reduce their number of 
sexual partners by 25%. HIV mortality is modelled as a 
fraction of patients diagnosed at CD4 count of less than 
350 cells per μL who die after the first year of diagnosis, 
followed by a small mortality rate for the long-term 
diagnosed phase (figure 1).
Individuals tracked by the model (referred to as primary 
infections) are assumed to represent the following three 
population groups: men who have sex with men (MSM), 
heterosexual males, and heterosexual females. We did 
not include injecting drug users because needle reuse is 
in decline in the UK and HIV prevalence in this group is 
low (0·38% in the UK in 2015).3
We modelled secondary infections by estimating the 
proportion of those infected in Hackney in each of the 
three population groups, and for each of these, estimating 
annual onward HIV transmission events per year 
according to their HIV status (infection stage, diagnosis 
status, and circumcision status of partners). HIV status 
and population group determine an individual’s risk 
behaviour (number of partners and condom use) and 
infectiousness (higher infectiousness for MSM resulting 
from more frequent anal sex practice and reduced 
infectiousness of those diagnosed because of ART). We 
estimated HIV prevalence among partners from Public 
Health England data.19
Diagnosed HIV incidence and prevalence for Hackney 
have been relatively stable since 2008,19 therefore we 
assumed a constant HIV incidence in the model. We 
fitted the equilibrium state of the model to incidence in 
the control arm of the trial to calculate number of 
HIV-positive individuals in the model. Diagnosis rates 
for control and intervention scenarios were fitted to the 
number of infections diagnosed and the proportions 
diagnosed at each CD4 cell count band to trial data for 
intervention and control practices. We fitted the model 
using Bayesian inference done with Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo, with 95% credible intervals (95% CrIs) 
sampled from the posterior distribution.
We explored the sensitivity of model predictions to 
uncertainty in model parameters in univariate analysis 
by constructing a tornado diagram of incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimates at 40 years 
after the start of the trial, using ranges of values for key 
parameters (appendix p 21) and plotting sensitivity of 
ICER estimates over time to plausible ranges for those 
parameters identified as influential through the tornado 
analysis. Parameter values were not varied by a fixed 
percentage above and below the base case value as used 
in a typical tornado plot; reasonable parameter ranges 
were selected as informed by data sources. Uncertainty 
in model outcomes was expressed as 95% CrIs that 
were generated by use of probabilistic, multivariate 
sensitivity analysis, selecting model inputs from 
the 
model 
parameter 
ranges 
and 
with 
the 
2·5–97·5th percentile range of all results generated. 
The model was double-programmed in R version 3.0.3 
and Berkeley Madonna Version 8.3.18 to ensure 
robustness of the results. All other analyses were done 
with R.
Cost-effectiveness of the intervention was assessed with 
the ICER at different time horizons (durations since start 
of the intervention). We assessed cost-effectiveness for the 
duration of the trial only rather than as an ongoing 
intervention (ie, the model simulated a higher diagnosis 
rate for the first 28 months of the simulation, before 
reducing to the control rate for the remainder of the model 
run). This result was compared with a simulation by use 
of the control arm diagnosis rate for the entire simulation.

Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. JF, a clinician employed by NHS City and 
Hackney, which part-funded the study, was involved in 
designing the RHIVA2 trial, data interpretation, and 
writing the report, but had no role in data collection or 
analysis. The corresponding author had full access to all 
the study data and had final responsibility for the decision 
to submit for publication.
Results
Total cost of the intervention is estimated to be £127 724 
(appendix pp 14–15). Estimated mean cost per rapid test 
performed was £25 and mean cost per additional patient 
newly diagnosed because of the intervention was £7096 
(table 1).
With model parameters based on UK cost data 
(scenario 1) over a 40 year time horizon, ICERs are 
£22 201 (95% CrI 12 662–132 452) per QALY gained, 
£372 207 (268 162–1 903 385) per death averted, and 
£628 874 (434 902–4 740 724) per HIV transmission 
averted (table 2). RHIVA2 reaches the upper NICE cost-
effectiveness threshold (~£30 000 per QALY gained23) 
after 33 years. Costs are high during the first 10 years 
after the RHIVA2 trial because increased medical costs 
are incurred by earlier diagnosis of infected individuals. 
However, this effect decreases over time because it is 
compensated by the benefits of reduction of onward HIV 
transmission and reduced health-care costs for people 
living with HIV who are diagnosed earlier.
Total QALYs gained because of the intervention are 
negative until 8·5 years after the start of the trial 
(figure 2A) because quality of life decreases in the model 
upon diagnosis of the cohort (green line), having an 
immediate effect, whereas the benefits of deaths and 
secondary infections averted (blue line) take 8·5 years to 
balance out this effect.
By 50 years, cost per QALY gained under scenario 1 is 
well below the lower NICE cost-effectiveness threshold 
 
(figure 2B, table 2). ICER estimates for scenarios 2 and 3, 
based on evidence from Canada, show that the higher the 
HIV-related health-care costs are for long-term patients 
who were diagnosed late compared with those diagnosed 
earlier, the more rapidly RHIVA2 becomes cost-effective, 
reaching the upper NICE threshold in as little as 13 years 
(figure 2B).
The results presented in the cost-effectiveness plane 
(figure 2C) show the initial QALY loss resulting from 
early diagnosis over the first 8·5 years. However, the 
intervention continues to derive benefits in terms of 
QALYs gained as well as costs saved for decades, 
because earlier testing reduces HIV transmission 
(table 2).
Predictions of the ICER of the RHIVA2 trial are most 
sensitive to incidence of new HIV infections in Hackney, 
closely followed by uncertainty in the estimate of quality 
of life of patients when in the acute stage of HIV 
infection (figure 3, appendix p 21). A higher incidence 
produced a lower model-predicted ICER (cost per QALY 
gained). A higher incidence leads to more cases in the 
community, so the intervention averts more secondary 
infections, thus increasing QALYs gained and reducing 
costs. The model is sensitive to acute-stage HIV quality 
of life because of its large range of uncertainty. Ribbon 
plots show how uncertainty in ICER estimates to these 
two key parameters change over time since the start of 
the intervention (appendix pp 11–12). Notably, model 
uncertainty resulting from the acute-stage infection 
quality of life multiplier decreases substantially over 
time since the start of intervention. This result is 
because at the start of screening, QALYs are gained 
through prevention of new infections that start in the 
acute stage, but over time, QALYs gained are from 
prevention of QALY loss as a result of chronic HIV 
infection. Importantly, the ribbon plots (appendix 
pp 11–12) show that uncertainty in ICER predictions 
decreases hugely over time and by 40 years after

RHIVA2 start, ICER values become centred on the 
NICE cost-effectiveness threshold.
Modelled ICER predictions over time are not 
substantively affected by assumptions regarding the 
reduction in risk-taking behaviour that individuals with 
HIV adopt once they are diagnosed (figure 4A) or by 
assumptions regarding quality of life after diagnosis 
(figure 4B). Changes in sexual behaviour have relatively 
little effect on the ICER because the most diagnosed 
patients 
with 
HIV 
are 
receiving 
ART, 
which 
substantially reduces HIV infectiousness, so different 
patterns of sexual risk do not much influence 
transmission. Varying QALY and cost yearly discount 
rates from 1·5% to 5·0% varies the duration before 
RHIVA2 reaches the upper cost-effectiveness threshold

Discussion
Screening for HIV in primary care is cost-effective in 
the medium term in settings of high HIV incidence 
such as Hackney because of lower health-care costs of 
people living with HIV if diagnosed earlier and ongoing 
reductions in HIV transmission. Our model-based 
predictions are sensitive to assumptions regarding the 
increased cost of managing late-diagnosed HIV 
infection, for which UK-based data are scarce. If HIV 
health-care costs remain permanently elevated by at 
least 60% for patients diagnosed late (CD4 count 
≤350 cells per μL), RHIVA2 becomes cost-effective 
more rapidly (between 13 years and 18 years in our 
modelled scenarios) and even becomes cost-saving. 
Therefore, general practice-based HIV screening is an 
important public health intervention deserving of 
scaling up.
Our study has a number of strengths. To our 
knowledge, ours is the first study to use data from a 
randomised controlled trial of HIV screening in primary 
care. That RHIVA2 was a pragmatic trial including 
almost all general practices in a large inner city borough 
strengthens the generalisability of our findings. We have 
done a full uncertainty analysis involving tornado plots 
for univariable analysis and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis to provide 95% CrIs that provide a range for 
each model output to reflect the uncertainty in our 
model inputs. For some of the more potentially 
influential model inputs, we did scenario analyses to 
explore how different assumptions changed the model 
outputs.
Our study also has limitations, reflecting uncertainties 
regarding the values of inputs for modelling the 
transmission of a sexually transmitted disease. The 
paucity of reliable data to inform sexual behaviour and 
HIV transmission parameters means we designed our 
model to track secondary infections, as opposed to a 
full transmission model that accounts for all HIV

transmissions. This approach has been used by others,19 
and slightly underestimates benefits of the intervention 
because tertiary HIV infections onwards are not 
included. Given the small influence that onward HIV 
transmission has on intervention cost (appendix p 10) 
and the insufficient sensitivity of the model to sexual risk 
behaviour assumptions, we would not anticipate tertiary 
transmissions and beyond to affect our findings 
substantially. Further detail of limitations is given in the 
appendix (p 5).
Our analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of the 
RHIVA2 trial, lasting 28 months, rather than that of an 
ongoing intervention. If RHIVA2 were to continue or 
have the residual effect of prolonged, increased HIV 
diagnosis rates, the intervention would take slightly 
longer to reach cost-effectiveness, but would be even 
more cost-effective overall. This result would be because 
the reduced quality of life of patients immediately 
following diagnosis initially counteracts QALYs saved 
through limiting transmission, but ultimately prevention 
of new infections has the greatest effect.
Our findings show the importance of the collection of 
accurate data on actual costs of HIV treatment to the NHS 
to produce more reliable cost-effectiveness estimates. 
Uncertainty about how long-term HIV health-care costs 
vary by HIV stage at diagnosis substantially affects our 
cost-effectiveness predictions. However, NHS England 
still does not have consistent information on costs for 
many specialised services.24
Previous HIV testing cost-effectiveness studies from 
high-income countries have produced contrasting 
results, depending on the nature of the testing 
intervention investigated and the assumptions made in 
the analysis. Sanders and colleagues10 estimated that 
screening for symptomatic HIV patients was highly 
cost-effective. However, they assumed ART initiation at 
CD4 counts of 350 cells per μL or less and focused on 
identification of late-stage patients, whereas treatment in 
the UK generally occurs earlier than this (83% of all 
people living with HIV in 2015 were on treatment3). Our 
model assumes increased diagnosis rates across all 
HIV-infected individuals, regardless of CD4 cell count. 
Therefore, earlier diagnosis of asymptomatic patients 
will not produce great QALY gains but substantially 
increases treatment costs, making our cost-effectiveness 
predictions more modest.
Long and colleagues19 assessed annual HIV testing of 
UK adults, concluding it to be very cost-effective when 
targeted to key populations (such as MSM). Phillips 
and colleagues25 evaluated increased HIV testing in 
MSM in the UK and presented scenarios in which 
substantial increases in HIV testing (ie, in which more 
than 90% of MSM are diagnosed within a year of 
infection) were cost-effective. Such scenarios represent 
a highly intensive and targeted intervention which 
would probably have a major effect on the MSM HIV 
epidemic. Restriction of RHIVA2 to screening self-
identifying MSM only would probably increase its cost-
effectiveness but at the expense of missing large 
numbers of diagnoses (for example, in northeast 
London, 34% of new HIV diagnoses in 2015 were in 
women,26 which calls into question the equity of 
targeted interventions).
The START27 and ANRS TEMPRANO28 trials have 
shown reduced morbidity and mortality with earlier 
treatment, even in patients with high CD4 cell counts 
(>500 cells per μL); such benefits of earlier HIV treatment 
initiation would make RHIVA2 cost-effective at an even 
earlier time horizon.
The estimated cost-effectiveness of RHIVA2 is 
comparable to that of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) 
among MSM, implementation of which in high-income 
countries has been the subject of several health economic 
analyses.29–31 PrEP cost-effectiveness estimates have 
ranged from cost-saving (Canada30) to US$160 000 per 
QALY gained (USA29). Preliminary cost-effectiveness 
results of MSM PrEP in the UK have also varied, from 
£26 30032 to cost-saving per QALY gained33 in base case 
scenarios. The latter ICER used an 80 year time 
horizon,33 whereas we report cost-effectiveness at 
40 years after the start of the intervention. Cost-
effectiveness of these HIV prevention interventions 
increase with time and so RHIVA2 is of comparable 
cost-effectiveness.

Our cost-effectiveness analysis is relatively unusual 
because we are considering a public health intervention 
involving therapeutic drug use, thus providing both 
individual-level and population-level benefits. Early 
diagnosis of people who are HIV-positive has benefits for 
the individual in terms of improved prognosis, reduces 
inequalities, and improves access to effective ART, while 
also benefiting the wider community by reducing onward 
HIV transmission. The community benefit is because 
people living with HIV who are diagnosed earlier are 
treated earlier, thus reducing their infectiousness, and 
might also reduce their risk-taking behaviour, thus 
reducing population exposure to HIV. Our results 
suggest that most of the HIV prevention benefit of 
RHIVA2 is due to earlier ART initiation rather than 
changes in behaviour. They highlight the need for further 
UK health-care cost data, by CD4 cell count band at 
diagnosis, for HIV economic evaluations.
Translation of the findings of the RHIVA2 trial and 
this accompanying cost-effectiveness analysis into 
action is crucial. We have evaluated the effectiveness 
and cost-effectiveness of RHIVA2 in a high HIV-
prevalence local authority. RHIVA2 is probably less 
cost-effective in low-prevalence authorities (defined as 
<0·2%, which is the NICE and British HIV Association 
threshold for routine HIV testing in primary care) and 
we would currently recommend primary care-based 
HIV screening in high-prevalence regions only. 
11 authorities have HIV prevalence similar to Hackney 
(0·80–1·46%) and 74 of 325 authorities in England are 
defined as high prevalence and could benefit 
from screening.15 We are currently comparing the 
implementation of RHIVA2 with different HIV testing 
interventions in neighbouring London boroughs with 
slightly lower prevalences. Further analyses with these 
data might identify a cutoff HIV prevalence below 
which screening is not cost-effective, but it is more 
likely for recommendations for screening to tally with 
low-prevalence cutoff defined by Public Health England 
of less than 0·2%. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness is 
affected by other factors varying by region, such as 
proportion of infections undiagnosed. Daily PrEP for 
10 000 MSM has been estimated to cost £54 million 
per year.32 The RHIVA2 trial intervention, covering 
half of Hackney general practices, cost £127 724  over 
28 
months. 
Thus, 
estimated 
annual 
screening 
programme costs for roll-out to all 11 Hackney-level 
HIV-prevalence authorities is about £600 000, and 
£4 million for roll-out to all high-prevalence authorities. 
RHIVA2 therefore represents an affordable prevention 
measure across all high-prevalence authorities in 
England. These figures are screening programme costs 
and do not include the increased HIV health-care costs 
resulting from earlier HIV diagnosis and treatment, 
which would fall under other NHS budgets (our 
analysis is of the 28 month trial rather than an ongoing, 
continuous intervention, so we cannot estimate an 
average health-care cost of the intervention per year).
Although ART as a prevention intervention is very 
effective, and treatment coverage in the UK is high, the 
estimated number of people living with undiagnosed 
HIV remains substantial and the number of people
