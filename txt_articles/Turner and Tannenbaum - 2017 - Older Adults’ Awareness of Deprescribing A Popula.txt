 Older Adults’ Awareness of Deprescribing: A Population-Based
Survey
Justin P. Turner, PhD*† and Cara Tannenbaum, MD, MSc*†‡ On behalf of the Canadian
Deprescribing Network*
OBJECTIVES: To determine older adults’ awareness of
the concept of medication-induced harm and their famil-
iarity with the term “deprescribing.” Secondary objectives
were to ascertain determinants of self-initiated deprescrib-
ing conversations and to identify how older adults seek
information on medication harms.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional
population-based
household
telephone survey using random-digit dialling.
SETTING: Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling
adults
aged
65
and older (N = 2,665; n = 898 men, n = 1,767 women,
mean age 74.9 � 7.2, range 65–100).
MEASUREMENTS: Information was gathered on age;
sex; awareness of the term “deprescribing”; knowledge
and information-seeking behaviors related to medication
harms; and previous initiation of a deprescribing conversa-
tion with a healthcare professional. Three targeted classes
of
potentially
inappropriate
prescriptions
were
asked
about: sedative-hypnotics, glyburide, and proton pump
inhibitors. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses
were used to quantify associations.
RESULTS: Two-thirds (65.2%, 95% confidence interval
(CI) = 63.4–67.0%) of participants were familiar with the
concept of medication-induced harms. Only 6.9% (95%
CI = 5.9–7.8%) recognized the term deprescribing; 48%
(95% CI = 46–50%) had researched medication-related
harms. Older adults most commonly sought information
from the Internet (35.5%, 95% CI = 33.4–37.6%), and
from health care professionals (32.2%, 95% CI = 30.1–
34.3%). Patient-initiated deprescribing conversations were
associated with awareness of medication harms (odds ratio
(OR) = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.46–2.07), familiarity with the
term deprescribing (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.13–2.12), and
information-seeking
behaviors
(OR = 4.57,
95%
CI = 3.84–5.45), independent of age and sex.
CONCLUSION: Healthcare
providers
can
facilitate
patient-initiated deprescribing conversations by providing
information on medication harms and using the term “de-
prescribing.” J Am Geriatr Soc 65:2691–2696, 2017.

M
edications are defined as inappropriate when the
potential for harm outweighs the potential for bene-
fit, particularly when safer alternatives exist.1,2 There are a
number of consensus documents for the avoidance of inap-
propriate medication in older adults, such as the Beers cri-
teria and the Screening Tool of Older Persons’ potentially
inappropriate Prescriptions—Screening Tool to Alert to
Right Treatment list.1,2 Despite these recommendations,
one-quarter of older adults take at least one potentially
inappropriate prescription medication each year, increasing
the risk of medication-related hospital admission and
unnecessary
expenditure
for
the
healthcare
system.3
Seventy percent of older adults are willing to deprescribe a
medication, yet the prevalence of inappropriate medica-
tions remains unchanged.4
Healthcare providers may be partially to blame for the
persistent prescription of inappropriate medications. Fewer
than 20% of family and internal medicine doctors consult
criteria for potentially inappropriate medications when
prescribing for older adults.5 Fewer than 50% of commu-
nity-based pharmacists are aware of the prevalence of
potentially inappropriate medications in individuals aged
65 and older.6

In
the
Eliminating
Medications
Through Patient Ownership of End Results (EMPOWER)
study, direct-to-consumer education about the potential
harms of sedative-hypnotics led 62% of trial participants
to discuss deprescribing with a healthcare provider and
27% to discontinue chronic sedative-hypnotic use within
6 months.7 Likewise, greater public awareness of antibiotic
overuse correlates with a reduction in patient expectations
for antibiotics and a lower rate of antibiotic prescribing in
some studies.8–11 These examples suggest that increasing
patient awareness of low-value care is an effective strategy
for driving conversations between patients and healthcare
providers, leading to deprescribing of inappropriate medi-
cations.7,11,12
Many older adults remain uninformed about medi-
cation
harms
and
do
not
question
their
prescrip-
tions.13,14
It
is
likely
that
raising
awareness
of
inappropriate medications and the concept of deprescrib-
ing will increase engagement of older adults in depre-
scribing
conversations.
The
effectiveness
of
strategies
aimed
at
widespread
empowerment
of
older
adults
requires a population-level baseline assessment of their
knowledge of medication harms and familiarity with the
term
“deprescribing.”
Data
gathered
through
these
assessments are essential for designing and evaluating
awareness campaigns that equip older adults with the
necessary information to engage in deprescribing conver-
sations with healthcare professionals.
The primary objective of this study was to determine
older adults’ awareness of the concept of medication-
induced harm and their familiarity with the term “depre-
scribing.” Secondary objectives were to ascertain determi-
nants of patient-initiated deprescribing conversations and
to identify how older adults seek information on medica-
tion harms.
METHODS
Study Design, Participants and Setting
This is a cross-sectional population-based household tele-
phone survey. The sampling frame consisted of all listed
household telephones numbers in Canada. Households
were called at random according to a quota-based strati-
fied sampling framework. The quota target was 200
respondents for each of Canada’s 10 provinces and three
territories. Long-term care residences were excluded. Eligi-
ble
respondents
were
community-dwelling
men
and
women aged 65 and older who spoke English or French
and consented to participate. Nonrespondents were defined
as those who refused to participate, had a language bar-
rier, or were incapable of answering the survey questions.
Unresolved telephone numbers were defined as a busy line,
no answer, or an answering machine. Unresolved numbers
were added back into the sampling frame until the target
quotas were met.
Data Collection
The survey was conducted between August and October
2016
using
computer
aided
telephone
interviewing
software and random-digit dialling. Employment of bilin-
gual staff ensured that the survey could be administered in
English or French. Completion of the survey took on aver-
age 7 minutes.
Survey Design
The “perceived severity” and “perceived susceptibility”
components of the Health Belief Model of behavior change
underpinned the development of the survey.15–17 This
model theorizes that a behavior will occur if a perceived
threat (severity and susceptibility) is high, and perceived
benefits outweigh barriers. Data from the EMPOWER
study show that acquisition of new knowledge about the
risks of medication-related harms motivates and triggers
older adults to engage in deprescribing conversations.7,14,18
The
questions
in
the
current
survey
were
therefore
designed to determine the proportion of older adults with
knowledge of medication harms and to assess the extent to
which this knowledge is associated with initiation of a
deprescribing conversation. Additionally, questions were
developed to identify the sources of information that older
adults use to acquire information about medication harms
to determine potential barriers and optimize access to this
information.19,20
An
expert
panel
with
clinical
and
research experience in geriatrics and deprescribing, consist-
ing of specialist physicians, nurses, pharmacists, allied
health professionals, and health researchers, reviewed the
content validity of the survey questions. To ensure that
medical terminology was written at a level that could be
easily understood by community dwelling seniors, and to
ensure that the survey had face validity when conducted
with older adults, a convenience sample of older adults
reviewed the survey questions and iteratively improved the
readability. A final check of face validity, readability, and
consistent messaging in French and English was made
using a bilingual pilot telephone survey of a random sam-
ple of 55 older adults across Canada.
Questions were asked about age, sex, number of pre-
scription medications (0, 1–4, 5–9, ≥10); awareness of the
term “deprescribing,” past history of initiating a conversa-
tion with a healthcare professional about stopping a medi-
cation (initiating a deprescribing conversation), knowledge
of harmful effects of medications, information-seeking
behavior in relation to medication harms, and patterns of
information-seeking
about
medication
side
effects.
In
accordance with a national strategy to reduce the use of
inappropriate prescriptions, the survey included additional
questions about use and awareness of harms relating to
three targeted drug classes, which were chosen as quality
indicators of inappropriateness: sedative-hypnotics, gly-
buride, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).21 The survey is
available upon request.
Sample Size Calculation
We calculated that a sample size of 2,401 older adults
was needed to provide a pan-Canadian population esti-
mate of the awareness of the term “deprescribing” with
95% confidence and a 2% margin of error. Canada
comprises unique healthcare jurisdictions across 10 pro-
vinces and three territories. The prevalence of people

 aged 65 and older varies from 3.7% in Nunavut to
19% in New Brunswick.22 For comparison of healthcare
jurisdictions, 188 older adults were required per province
and territory to provide a margin of error of 6% with a
90% confidence interval (CI) for a 50% response distri-
bution.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics with 95%
CIs. Statistically significant associations between two cate-
gorical variables were calculated using chi-square tests.
Univariate and multivariate associations were determined
using logistic regression. Parameters that were associated
with an exposure and significant (at P < .10) in univariate
analysis were included as potential confounders in adjusted
analyses. To provide an accurate representation of the
Canadian population as a whole, results were weighted to
account for variations in population size between health-
care jurisdictions. SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY) was used.
Ethical Considerations
Participation in the survey was voluntary, and agreement
to answer the telephone questions was taken as consent to
participate. No identifying information was collected. The
Research Ethics Board at the Institut Universitaire de G�
eri-
atrie de Montr�
eal approved the study (approval 15–16–
34).
RESULTS
Respondent Characteristics and Medication Use
Of 64,043 household calls attempted, there were 12,156
invalid numbers and 16,659 respondents (26%). Of the
16,659 respondents, 2,665 met eligibility criteria and
agreed to complete the survey (16%).
The mean age of respondents was 74.9�7.2 (range
65–100), 66.3% (95% CI = 64.4–68.1%) were female,
23.8% (95% CI = 22.3–25.3) completed the survey in
French, 88.3% (95% CI = 87.1–89.6%) had consumed at
least one prescription medication during the previous
12 months, and 41.6% (95% CI = 39.7–43.4%) had con-
sumed a sedative-hypnotic, glyburide, or a PPI, with preva-
lence varying according to each jurisdiction (Supplemental
Table S1). Female respondents were more likely than male
to have consumed a prescription medication within the
previous year (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.16–1.88) and to
have
consumed
a sedative-hypnotic
(OR = 1.48,
95%
CI = 1.18–1.85) or a PPI (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.51–
2.22), although no difference was observed for glyburide
(OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.44–1.02). Older age (≥80) was
directly associated with sedative hypnotic use and inversely
associated with PPI use (Table 1). Sedative-hypnotic medi-
cation use was more prevalent in French-speaking respon-
dents (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.09–1.70).
Likelihood of Initiating Conversations About
Deprescribing
Approximately
two-thirds
(65.2%,
95%
CI = 63.4–
67.0%) of respondents were aware that some prescription
medications could be harmful (Table 2), and 41.8%, 95%
CI = 39.8–43.7%) had initiated a deprescribing conversa-
tion with a healthcare provider, with the prevalence vary-
ing
significantly
according
to
province
and
territory
(Supplemental Table S2). Women and individuals younger
than 80 were more likely to initiate deprescribing conver-
sations. Awareness of medication harms raised the likeli-
hood of initiating a deprescribing conversation with a
healthcare professional (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.46–2.07),
independent of medication class and sex (Table 3).

OLDER ADULTS’ AWARENESS OF DEPRESCRIBING
2693
 Only 6.9% of respondents (95% CI = 5.9–7.8%) were
familiar with the term “deprescribing.” French-speaking
respondents were less likely to be aware of the potential
for
medication-related
harms
(OR = 0.28,
95%
CI = 0.23–0.33) and were less familiar with the term “de-
prescribing” (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.43–0.95) than Eng-
lish-speaking
respondents.
Awareness
of
the
term
“deprescribing” was associated with greater likelihood of
initiating a deprescribing conversation with a healthcare
professional (adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.13–
2.12, adjusted for age).
Source of Information About Medication Harms
Forty-eight percent (95% CI = 46–50%) of respondents
reported
searching
for
information
about
medication
harms (Table 2, Supplemental Table S3). Individuals who
researched medication-related harms were four times as
likely to initiate deprescribing conversations (aOR = 4.57,
95% CI = 3.84–5.45) (Table 3). The most-common source
of information was the Internet; individuals who sought
information about medication-related harms on the Inter-
net were 3 times as likely to initiate a deprescribing con-
versation (aOR = 2.97, 95% CI = 2.46–3.59). Of those
who actively sought information about sedative-hypnotics,
glyburide, or PPIs, approximately half considered dose
reduction, discontinuation, or substitution (Supplemental
Table S3).
DISCUSSION
Two-thirds of Canadian community-dwelling older adults
are aware that some prescriptions can cause harm, half of
them research information about medication harms, and
only 6.9% are familiar with the term “deprescribing.”
Awareness of medication harms, actively searching for
information on medication harms, and knowledge of the

 initiating a deprescribing conversation; 41.8% of older
adults surveyed in this study reported discussing depre-
scribing with a healthcare provider, although this preva-
lence is lower than the 50.8% of community-dwelling
older adults and 89% of hospitalized older adults who
would like to reduce the number of medications they
take.4,23
Approximately
three-quarters
of
community-
dwelling older adults are willing to cease one of their med-
ications if their doctor says it is possible, with 51.2% and
42.6% in favor of their pharmacist or nurse leading the
deprescribing process, respectively.4 Integrating the term
“deprescribing” into common vernacular may increase the
acceptability and frequency of deprescribing conversations
between patients and healthcare providers.
The findings from this national survey of older adults
are consistent with previous research demonstrating a link
between public awareness of medication harms and reduc-
tion of inappropriate medication use.7–12 The magnitude
of association is substantial; respondents who actively seek
information relating to medication harms are four times as
likely to initiate deprescribing conversations, and half con-
sider medication cessation, dose reduction, or substitution.
Even in a large, heterogeneous population of older adults,
use of the Internet to seek out information about medica-
tion harms nearly triples the likelihood of initiating a
deprescribing conversation. Despite earlier reports that
Internet-based education produces limited effects,24 possi-
bly because of the poor quality of the information avail-
able,25
more-recent
research
incorporating
theoretical
behavior change techniques demonstrates that Internet-
delivered educational interventions are effective at chang-
ing health behavior.26 Healthcare providers and organiza-
tions tasked with a mandate to improve quality use of
medications might consider investing in freely available,
theory-based Internet education to increase awareness of
inappropriate prescriptions, medication-induced harm, and
deprescribing. Attention will need to be paid to patient
concerns about privacy and credibility of the source of the
information.27
Major strengths of this study include the representa-
tion of older adults across all Canadian provinces and ter-
ritories and the large sample size. There are several
limitations. The first is the possibility of respondent bias.
Only 16% of respondents agreed to complete the survey,
with nonresponders expressing disinterest or a language
barrier. The effect of respondent bias is likely overestima-
tion of the proportion of older adults who are aware of
medication
harms
and
deprescribing,
because
concern
about medication harms may have motivated participation
in the study.28 As with any survey, there is also the possi-
bility of social desirability bias, by which participants pro-
vide the responses they think the researchers want to hear,
as opposed to answering honestly.28 The survey questions
were cross-sectional in nature so no causal relationships
between associations can be established. Finally, the term
“harmful medication” may be a vague reflection of the
medical term “potentially inappropriate medication.” To
improve accuracy, multiple terms were piloted, with vari-
ous groups of older Anglophone and Francophone Cana-
dian adults choosing “harmful medications” (translated as
“effets n�
efastes des m�
edicaments”) unanimously as the pre-
ferred term. A detailed explanation was provided for
respondents requiring clarification. Despite the question-
naire being provided in French and English, there are pop-
ulations within Canada who do not speak either of these
languages, resulting in many nonresponses and an inability
to meet the target sample size in the territory of Nunavut.
The Canadian population is similar but differs from those
of other countries in its high prevalence of French-speaking
individuals and lower prevalence of black and Hispanic
populations than in the United States.
In conclusion, despite increasing attention being paid
to deprescribing in academic circles, few older adults are
familiar with the term. Healthcare providers have an
important role to play in empowering older adults with
information about medication harms to trigger safer medi-
cation management. For older adults, the Internet may be
an important vector for promoting awareness about the
quality use of medicines and improving awareness and cul-
ture regarding deprescribing.
