Abstract
The emerging standard of care for patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer is a combination of 
cytotoxic drugs gemcitabine and Abraxane, but patient response remains moderate. Pancreatic 
cancer development and metastasis occur in complex settings, with reciprocal feedback from 
microenvironmental cues influencing both disease progression and drug response. Little is known 
about how sequential dual targeting of tumor tissue tension and vasculature before chemotherapy 
can affect tumor response. We used intravital imaging to assess how transient manipulation of the 
tumor tissue, or “priming,” using the pharmaceutical Rho kinase inhibitor Fasudil affects response 
to chemotherapy. Intravital Förster resonance energy transfer imaging of a cyclin-dependent kinase

 1 biosensor to monitor the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs revealed that priming improves pancreatic 
cancer response to gemcitabine/Abraxane at both primary and secondary sites. Transient priming 
also sensitized cells to shear stress and impaired colonization efficiency and fibrotic niche 
remodeling within the liver, three important features of cancer spread. Last, we demonstrate a 
graded response to priming in stratified patient-derived tumors, indicating that fine-tuned tissue 
manipulation before chemotherapy may offer opportunities in both primary and metastatic 
targeting of pancreatic cancer.
INTRODUCTION
A number of new therapeutics have been exploited to improve upon gemcitabine (Gem) in 
pancreatic cancer (PC). Recently, the addition of nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) to Gem 
improved patient survival from 6.6 to 8.7 months (1). Although the improvements found 
with the antimitotic Abraxane are encouraging and the combination is rapidly becoming a 
first-line treatment in this aggressive disease (2), there is an urgent need to improve upon 
this moderate shift in patient survival.
The actin cytoskeleton and its prototypical regulatory proteins Rhoguanosine 
triphosphatases (GTPases) are commonly hijacked by many cancers to drive tumor 
progression (3-6). In particular, altering cytoskeleton-based cell contractility affects not only 
coordinated cancer cell protrusion during invasion but also the bidirectional interaction 
between stromal and cancer cells to induce tissue stiffening and drive tumor survival, 
proliferation, and progression (7-10). Hence, targeting tissue architecture via Rho GTPase 
inhibition to alter tissue stiffness, cellular rheology, vasodilation, or mechanoplasticity is an 
emerging area of potential therapeutic intervention in cancer (3, 5,11-14).
Optimizing preclinical disease models in drug discovery requires innovative approaches to 
assess drug response in live tissue at the single-cell and molecular levels. Intravital imaging 
offers insights into how cells behave in their native environment and provides a dynamic 
four-dimensional (4D) molecular readout of therapeutic response, undetectable in vitro 
(15,16). Here, we derived primary and invasive cells from both the Pdxl-Cre, LSL-
KrasG12D/+, LSL-Trp53R172H/+ (KPC) mouse model (17-21) and pancreatic patient-derived 
xenografts (PDXs) and engineered them to express the highly validated cyclin-dependent 
kinase 1 (CDK1) Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor (22,23). We monitored 
CDK1 activity as a surrogate marker of M-phase cell cycle arrest induced by Gem/Abraxane 
(22-27). Upon investigating the ultrastructure, integrity, and stiffness of the extracellular 
matrix (ECM) in complex organotypic matrices in response to transient priming with the 
ROCK inhibitor Fasudil (HA-1077) (28), we mapped PC cell response to Gem/Abraxane in 
live tumor tissues during disease progression. First, this was achieved through 
spatiotemporal monitoring of the response to Gem/Abraxane at distinct sites within live 
primary tumors and PDXs, whereas assessment in liver metastases revealed a multisite 
improvement in response to chemotherapy after transient dual manipulation of tissue tension 
and tumor vasculature with Fasudil. Second, priming impaired tumor cell extravasation 
efficiency, resistance to shear stress, and metastatic niche remodeling within the liver, 
reducing spread in secondary sites. Last, we reveal a graded response to transient priming

 regimens relative to ECM found in PDXs from the Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome 
Initiative (APGI) cohort (29). Collectively, we present preclinical evidence that tailored, 
fine-tuned tissue priming before chemotherapy may offer opportunities in both primary and 
metastatic targeting in PC.
RESULTS
Priming the stroma via ROCK inhibition disrupts ECM integrity
The effect of ROCK inhibition on ECM integrity was assessed using fibroblast-driven 
contraction assays, which revealed a decrease in contraction upon treatment with Fasudil 
(Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of ROCK signaling in matrices confirmed 
that Fasudil inhibits the downstream targets of ROCK, pMLC2, and pMYPT1 (fig. S1, A 
and B) (30), whereas 2D and 3D cell proliferation analyses indicated that impairment of 
matrix contraction was independent of changes in fibroblast proliferation and survival (fig. 
S1, C to E).
Second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging (31) and polarized light microscopy of 
picrosirius red staining (32, 33) of contracted collagen matrices revealed a reduction in 
fibrillar collagen coverage upon ROCK inhibition compared to control (Fig. 1, B to D, and 
fig. S1F), whereas collagen production was unaltered (Fig. 1, E and F). Live monitoring of 
fibroblast-ECM interactions (Fig. 1G and movie S1) (34) demonstrated uncoordinated, 
shorter, and unstable fibroblast protrusions in Fasudil-treated conditions, as well as increased 
cell circularity (Fig. 1H). Analysis of matrix ultrastructure using gray-level cooccurrence 
matrix (GLCM) (35) and scanning electron microscopy confirmed a disorganized ECM 
network in Fasudil-treated condition (Fig. 1, I to K), and atomic force microscopy 
measurements revealed a reduction in matrix stiffness for primed matrices (Fig. 1L). Similar 
results were observed for matrices treated with the structurally unrelated ROCK inhibitor 
Y-27632 (fig. S1, G to L), confirming that ROCK targeting disrupts matrix integrity.
Recent studies assessing the effect of stromal manipulation via longterm interference with 
ECM remodeling have yielded conflicting data on the utility of stromal targeting in limiting 
the progression of PC (10, 12, 36-43). We therefore sought to assess whether fine-tuned 
transient interference with stromal tension affects PC progression and drug response (10).
The scheduling of priming regimens influences PC cell invasion and Gem/Abraxane 
efficacy
We examined cancer cell invasion in a 3D organotypic model using primary PC cells 
established from KPC mice (17, 18, 44, 45). 3D organotypic matrices were treated with 
Fasudil either during contraction (priming) or during invasion (later treatment) (Fig. 2A). 
KPC cell invasion was decreased in matrices primed with Fasudil compared to control (Fig. 
2, B and C). Later Fasudil treatment alone did not significantly affect KPC invasion, and 
continuous treatment during both contraction and invasion had no advantage over priming of 
the matrix alone (Fig. 2, B and C), demonstrating that transient ROCK targeting can impair 
PC invasion and could minimize the need for long-term treatments.

 Because mechanical cues provided by the ECM have been suggested to limit response to 
chemotherapy (46, 47), we next investigated whether transient Fasudil priming would 
increase KPC cell response to subsequent Gem/Abraxane treatment in organotypic matrices. 
Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 staining demonstrated that Gem/Abraxane treatment alone 
reduced cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis (Fig. 2, D and E, black bars versus 
green bars), as expected given their clinical use (2). This was improved in Fasudil-primed 
settings (Fig. 2, D and E, green bars versus blue bars), although Fasudil priming alone had 
no effect on KPC cell proliferation and apoptosis in this context (Fig. 2, D and E, black bars 
versus orange bars).
Although these static markers of tumor behavior provide an initial insight into tumor 
response, they lack the capacity to monitor more detailed temporal and spatial information. 
We therefore opted to longitudinally map Gem/Abraxane therapy using a CDK1-FRET 
biosensor (22, 23) as a molecular readout of cell cycle arrest induced by chemotherapy (27).
A CDK1 biosensor monitors PC cell response to Gem/Abraxane
Primary KPC cells were engineered to express a CDK1-FRET biosensor, and the activity of 
CDK1 was measured by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of the FRET signal 
(FLIM-FRET; Fig. 3A). In the lifetime color maps, low CDK1 activity is represented by 
longer lifetimes and yellow/red colors, whereas high CDK1 activity is represented by shorter 
lifetimes and blue/green colors, and areas with no signal are black (Fig. 3B and fig. S2A).
To confirm that the CDK1-FRET biosensor reports changes in CDK1 activity, KPC cells 
were treated with Abraxane to arrest them in mitosis, where CDK1 activity is high (22-27), 
followed by treatment with the specific CDK1 inhibitor RO3306 (fig. S2, B and C) (48). 
Abraxane induced a decrease in the fluorescence lifetimes, indicating active CDK1, and 
treatment with RO3306 reverted the lifetimes to values similar to control, confirming CDK1 
inhibition (fig. S2, C and D, and movie S2). Using the lifetime distribution, we stratified 
cells as “CDK1 ON” or “CDK1 OFF” and confirmed changes in CDK1 activity by Western 
blot analysis of pY15-CDK1 (fig. S2, E and F). Similarly, FLIM-FRET analysis of cells in 
different stages of the cell cycle confirmed accumulation of active CDK1 in mitotic cells 
compared to cells in interphase (fig. S2, G to I, and movie S3). We also confirmed that 
expression of the CDK1 biosensor did not affect KPC cell response to Gem/Abraxane (fig. 
S2J). Next, monitoring changes in CDK1 activity upon treatment with Gem/Abraxane 
demonstrated a decrease of lifetime and increased activation of CDK1 compared to control 
(Fig. 3B). This aligned with CDK1 activation and mitotic arrest as confirmed by FACS 
(fluorescence- activated cell sorting) and Western blot analyses (fig. S2, K and L) (49). After 
validating the CDK1 biosensor, we monitored individual KPC cell response to 
chemotherapy within a 3D microenvironment (Fig. 3C).
Priming with Fasudil improves the spatiotemporal response of Gem/Abraxane in 
organotypic matrices
Cancer progression and response to drug treatment can be regulated by environmental cues 
within tumor subpopulations, such as areas of invasion (50-53). Hence, we assessed CDK1 
activity in cells invading into the matrix versus cells on top of the matrix over time (Fig. 3, C 
Vennin et al.

 to E, and movie S4). For cells on top of the matrix, we observed a decrease in FRET lifetime 
and corresponding activation of CDK1 after 16 hours of treatment with Gem/Abraxane. This 
was sustained for 24 hours and then reverted to higher lifetimes at 48 hours (Fig. 3D, purple 
line). An earlier activation of CDK1 in matrices that had been primed with Fasudil was 
evident after 8 hours of Gem/Abraxane treatment, and the activation of CDK1 was 
prolonged (Fig. 3D, orange line). Monitoring of CDK1 at depth demonstrated a distinctly 
delayed pattern of response to Gem/Abraxane in invading cells (compare the purple line in 
Fig. 3D to that in Fig. 3E); however, Fasudil priming increased the response of invasive cells 
at later time points compared to Gem/Abraxane treatment alone (Fig. 3E). The ability to 
detect differences in drug efficacy in a spatial manner allowed us to uncover that 
proliferating cells on top of the matrix respond well to Gem/Abraxane therapy alone, 
whereas invading and less proliferative cells (confirmed in fig. S2M) (50) are less 
susceptible to cytotoxic drugs. Thus, although Fasudil interference with stromatumor 
feedback improves targeting of cells on top of the matrix, it may also have additional, yet 
somewhat delayed, benefits by rendering invasive cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy.
Priming live primary tumors enhances Gem/Abraxane efficacy
We next generated subcutaneous KPC-CDK1 xenografts, and once primary tumors were 
palpable, mice were primed with Fasudil for 3 days before treatment with Gem/Abraxane 
(Fig. 4A). Twenty-four hours after administration of Gem/Abraxane, live tumor tissues were 
exposed using a skin flap technique for intravital imaging (Fig. 4B). SHG imaging and 
polarized light microscopy of picrosirius red staining of KPC xenografts confirmed that 
Fasudil priming reduces fibrillar collagen organization in this setting, whereas no significant 
change in collagen content was observed (Fig. 4, C and D; fig. S3, A and B; and movie S5). 
In vivo FLIM-FRET analysis of the CDK1-FRET biosensor (movie S6) demonstrated 
activation of CDK1 upon Gem/Abraxane treatment alone, which was enhanced in Fasudil-
primed conditions (Fig. 4E, green bar versus blue bar), in line with findings in organotypic 
matrices (Figs. 2 and 3). Fasudil priming alone had no significant effect on CDK1 activity in 
live tumors (Fig. 4E, black bar versus orange bar). IHC analyses of pMYPT1 in KPC 
xenografts confirmed inhibition of ROCK signaling upon Fasudil priming (fig. S3C), 
whereas Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 analyses confirmed that although Fasudil priming alone 
had no significant effect on cell proliferation or survival, it improved the effectiveness of 
Gem/Abraxane in this setting (fig. S3, D and E). To assess whether ECM-independent 
mechanisms may also play a role in the enhanced response to chemotherapy, we examined 
the known role of Fasudil as a vasodilator in vivo (28) by evaluating vasculature abundance 
using anti-CD31 staining. This demonstrated an increase in CD31-positive cells upon 
treatment with Fasudil (Fig. 4F). We next injected quantum dots into mice bearing 
subcutaneous KPC tumors to assess whether vascular patency was altered in Fasudil-treated 
conditions (39, 54). Here, an increase in quantum dot signal was observed outside blood 
vessels, with quantum dots leaking into the tumor tissue in Fasudil-primed conditions 
compared to control (Fig. 4, G and H, and movie S7). Because PC patients often present 
with locally invasive and metastatic disease at diagnosis (55), we next investigated whether 
Fasudil priming alone or in combination with chemotherapy alters metastatic colonization of 
secondary sites.

 Priming with Fasudil enhances chemotherapy response at secondary sites and reduces 
metastatic spread
To mimic systemic ROCK inhibition or adjuvant therapy in the presence of circulating 
tumor cells, we performed intrasplenic injections of KPC cells expressing the CDK1-FRET 
biosensor in parallel with Fasudil administration (Fig. 5, A and B, and movie S8). FLIM-
FRET measurements of the CDK1 biosensor in liver metastases revealed that priming with 
Fasudil enhanced Gem/Abraxane efficacy at this secondary site (Fig. 5, C to E). In line with 
our results in primary tumors (Fig. 4), we observed enhanced CD31 staining and increased 
number of microvessels with detectable lumens in the livers of Fasudil-treated mice (Fig. 5F 
and fig. S4A), which could partly explain the observed enhanced drug response. 
Pathological and IHC analyses on serial sections of metastases (Fig. 5, G and H) confirmed 
that mice treated with Fasudil and Gem/Abraxane showed a marked reduction in metastatic 
spread compared to Gem/Abraxane treatment alone. This is in line with recent work 
regarding the establishment of the metastatic niche (56, 57) and prompted us to assess 
micrometastatic events, such as cancer cell extravasation, adhesion, response to shear stress, 
and colonization after Fasudil priming.
Priming hinders extravasation and spread in the liver while sensitizing cells to shear 
stress and reducing anchorage-independent growth
To identify pancreatic tumor cells that had recently extravasated in the liver and breached the 
matrix surrounding blood vessels, we stained liver tissues with Elastica van Gieson and 
PDX-1 (Fig. 6, A and B). Quantification of extravasation events revealed that priming with 
Fasudil impaired extravasation compared to control and Gem/Abraxane treatment (Fig. 6, A 
to C), suggesting that Fasudil may act as a potential antiadhesion drug. This mirrors recent 
work showing that targeting early “homing” events in the liver using anti-adhesion drugs can 
have additional advantages over cytotoxic targeting alone (58,59). To address the anti-
adhesion effect of Fasudil in a more controlled platform, we used cell-derived matrices 
(CDMs) (60, 61). Here, priming with Fasudil during ECM deposition and remodeling 
reduced ECM integrity (fig. S4, B to D). KPC cells were then seeded onto CDMs in the 
presence or absence of Gem/Abraxane (Fig. 6, D and E), and time-lapse tracking (fig. S4E) 
revealed a marked reduction in KPC cell adhesion in Fasudil-primed conditions over time 
compared to control and Gem/Abraxane counterparts (Fig. 6E, compare black and orange 
lines). In addition, the cytotoxic effects of Gem/Abraxane combined with Fasudil’s anti-
adhesion effect increased the reduction in KPC attachment and viability (Fig. 6E, compare 
green to blue lines at 24 hours). This was in line with FLIM-FRET analysis of CDK1 on 
CDMs and in the liver in vivo (Fig. 5C and fig. S4F), where Fasudil priming enhanced 
response to Gem/Abraxane.
To further assess the observed reduction of liver colonization upon Fasudil priming, we 
examined the viability of cells in response to shear stress and anchorage-independent growth 
(AIG), which circulating tumor cells are subjected to in vivo. KPC cells were primed with 
Fasudil and exposed to controlled shear stress as previously described (Fig. 6F) (62) and 
then plated on CDMs to measure their ability to attach, survive, or proliferate after shear 
stress. Cell attachment on CDMs and cell growth were reduced upon treatment with Fasudil, 
with a concomitant increase in apoptosis (Fig. 6G), as confirmed by FACS analyses (Fig. 
Vennin et al.

 6H). These data, along with reduced long-term AIG in Fasudil-primed conditions (Fig. 6I), 
point to a role of ROCK inhibition in sensitizing cells to shear stress in the systemic 
circulation and suggest an additional way in which Fasudil can impinge on metastasis in PC 
(10,13, 63, 64).
Fasudil priming reduces cell streaming and metastatic niche remodeling
To assess whether priming with Fasudil affects KPC cell movement, we performed time-
lapse monitoring of KPC cell streaming on CDMs primed with or without Fasudil and 
quantified cell movement anisotropy as a readout of coordinated cell movement (Fig. 7A and 
movie S9) (65). In control conditions, concerted streams of cells moving in a coordinated, 
organized manner were observed (Fig. 7A, green arrows) (65, 66). This was reduced in cells 
seeded on Fasudil-primed matrices, where noncoordinated cell movement was evident over 
time (Fig. 7, A and B), and was further supported by a clear decrease in cell stream width 
compared to control (Fig. 7C). We next studied whether Fasudil priming altered metastatic 
spread patterns in the liver using IHC analysis of PDX-1-stained serial sections. Here, we 
observed different morphology of metastases upon priming with Fasudil. In control and 
Gem/Abraxane conditions, we identified elongated and malleable emboli of KPC cells 
spreading throughout the liver tissue [Fig. 7, D (top) and E], whereas in Fasudil and Gem/
Abraxane or Fasudil alone conditions, metastases were round, and elongated emboli were 
ablated [Fig. 7, D (top) and E]. This observation suggests that Fasudil priming and 
manipulation of the ECM during the early stages of metastatic colonization (59) alter spread 
in the host tissue, as evidenced by an overall reduction in metastatic burden in these 
conditions (Fig. 5, G and H).
ECM remodeling can also provide cancer cells with a “fibrotic refuge” (67), supporting 
tumor growth and limiting chemotherapeutic targeting (68). Because Fasudil priming 
improved Gem/Abraxane effectiveness in the liver (Fig. 5, C to E), we assessed the ability of 
KPC cells to remodel the ECM upon priming with Fasudil. Using CDMs as a model system, 
we found that KPC cells can remodel the matrix of unprimed CDMs, as measured by 
increased SHG signal over time (Fig. 7, F and G, black lines). This was impaired for KPC 
cells seeded on Fasudil-primed CDMs, where SHG intensity did not significantly increase 
after seeding of KPC cells (Fig. 7, F and G, blue lines). Moreover, KPC cell protrusions on 
primed CDMs were also disrupted compared to control (fig. S4, G to I), in line with earlier 
observations, and this prompted us to assess the amount of fibrillar collagen within liver 
metastases. Here, we found that remodeling of the metastatic niche was impaired upon 
priming with Fasudil (Fig. 7, H to K, and fig. S4J). Hence, priming may make secondary 
tissues less permissive to the establishment of metastases and expose cancer cells to a less 
favorable environment (67). This may partly explain the enhanced response to chemotherapy 
at secondary sites observed in Fasudil-primed conditions.
Disruption of SRC signaling and actomyosin cytoskeleton dynamics with Fasudil may 
sensitize KPC cells to chemotherapy
In line with the reported role of ECM-integrin outside-in signaling in cancer (47, 69), we 
assessed whether the integrin-SRC signaling axis is altered upon priming with Fasudil. 
Using a SRC-FRET biosensor (fig. S5A) (70) in 3D organotypic matrices, we found that

 SRC activity is reduced after manipulation of the ECM with Fasudil (fig. S5, B and C) (70). 
Intravital imaging in subcutaneous KPC tumors also confirmed inhibition of SRC signaling 
in response to Fasudil priming in vivo (fig. S5, D and E). This is in line with the recent role 
that SRC has been proposed to play in both sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy (71-74) 
and driving ECM-dependent events in PC (75-77). Additionally, ROCK inhibitors can 
induce mitotic defects (78-81), and we therefore assessed early-to-mid and late mitosis in 
KPC subcutaneous tumors. This revealed that although we do not see any significant change 
of cell proliferation or death upon Fasudil priming (Fig. 4E and fig. S3, D and E), ROCK 
inhibition induces an accumulation of cells in late mitosis and multinuclear cells (fig. S5, F 
and G), thereby potentially making cells more responsive to subsequent treatment with 
antimicrotubule chemotherapy. Together, our data in cells from the KPC model suggest that 
priming delays PC progression in both primary and secondary sites. We therefore sought to 
translate our findings to patient-derived tumors.
Patient-derived models reveal potential for tailored, short-term priming strategy in PC
Because PC is highly heterogeneous (29, 82), we next assessed whether fibrillar collagen 
abundance could influence tumor response to priming with Fasudil before chemotherapy. 
SHG analysis of PDX samples from the APGI cohort (29) allowed us to identify TKCC2 as 
an example of a –low ECM PDX” and TKCC5 as an example of a “high ECM PDX” (Fig. 
8A). Patient-derived cancer cell lines (PDCLs) isolated from the respective PDXs (29) were 
then subcutaneously reinjected into mice (Fig. 8B). Subsequent SHG imaging revealed that 
reinjected PDCLs recapitulated many of the original features of the collagen matrix (Fig. 
8B), demonstrating the capacity of PDCLs to remodel the tissue and to “activate” host 
fibroblasts to maintain inherent features of the tumor.
To assess PDCL response to the priming regimen, we first established patient-personalized 
organotypic matrices, where cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), “activated” by the 
respective patient-derived tumor cells in vivo, were isolated from PDXs, embedded in 
collagen, and characterized by IHC staining with pancytokeratin, a-smooth muscle actin, and 
fibroblast activation protein (figs. S6 and S7). After remodeling of the matrix by CAFs, 
matched patient-derived cancer cells were seeded on top of the contracted matrices (figs. S6, 
A and C, and S7, A and C), as previously performed with KPC cells (Figs. 2 and 3). Priming 
with Fasudil impaired the ability of the “high ECM” TKCC5 CAFs to remodel collagen, as 
demonstrated by SHG analysis (fig. S6, B and D to F), and resulted in decreased cancer cell 
invasion (fig. S6, G and H) and increased response to Gem/Abraxane treatment (fig. S6, I 
and J). Conversely, priming had no effect on “low ECM” TKCC2 CAF-driven collagen 
contraction (fig. S7, B and D to F) and did not modify response to chemotherapy (fig. S7, G 
and H). This prompted us to assess TKCC2 and TKCC5 response to priming with Fasudil in 
live tumors.
PDCLs were engineered to express the CDK1-FRET biosensor, and in vitro FLIM-FRET 
measurements confirmed that the biosensor can distinguish changes in CDK1 activity in 
both lines (figs. S6, K and L, and S7, I and J), as previously achieved with KPC cells (fig. 
S2). CDK1-PDCLs were subcutaneously injected into mice, and when tumors were fully 
established (average tumor volume, 180 mm3, as previously described for KPC tumors; figs.

 S6M and S7K), mice were subjected to 3 days of priming with Fasudil before administration 
of Gem/Abraxane and intravital imaging (figs. S6M and S7K, timelines). Although SHG 
analysis demonstrated a reduction of fibrillar collagen abundance in the high ECM TKCC5 
upon manipulation with Fasudil (Fig. 8C), priming had no effect on the matrix of low ECM 
TKCC2 (Fig. 8C). Intravital analysis of CDK1 activity in response to chemotherapy revealed 
that priming with Fasudil induces a robust increase of TKCC5 response to Gem/Abraxane in 
vivo (Fig. 8D, left). A moderate improvement of TKCC2 response to chemotherapy was 
observed (Fig. 8D, right), demonstrating a graded response to the priming strategy in 
relation to initial PDX collagen status (Fig. 8E).
Last, given the enhanced response to priming found in the high ECM TKCC5 model, we 
assessed the long-term effects of priming on therapeutic response in an orthotopic patient-
derived model. Orthotopic injections of TKCC5 cells were conducted, and primary tumors 
were allowed to grow until average in vivo imaging system (IVIS) luciferase signal reached 
5 × 107 photons/s (fig. S8A). Mice were subjected to cycles of priming with Fasudil before 
administration of Gem/Abraxane until the experimental end point (Fig. 8F and fig. S8A). 
Survival was increased by the priming regimen compared to treatment with Gem/ Abraxane 
alone (mean survival: Gem/Abraxane, 51 days; Fasudil priming and Gem/Abraxane, 75 
days) (Fig. 8F). Mice receiving Fasudil priming before Gem/Abraxane also had a reduced 
primary tumor burden at the ethical end point (fig. S8B). Time to detection of metastasis 
observed via whole-body IVIS imaging was also delayed by the priming regimen compared 
to control (fig. S8, A and C).
Finally, we created an in-house automated SHG tool to analyze the International Cancer 
Genome Consortium (ICGC) cohort of patient biopsy samples (231ICGC samples) (Fig. 8G 
and fig. S8, D and E). Although we found no significant differences in survival or 
clinicopathological variables with regard to bulk patient ECM content (fig. S8F), in line with 
recent work (10), this rapid and label-free biopsy imaging approach could be used as a 
companion personalized biomarker for current stromal-based combination therapies in PC, 
where the initial amount of tumor ECM could guide whether a patient would be suitable for 
“transient” stromal intervention (Fig. 8, D to F) (12, 83).
DISCUSSION
Combined therapies and multimodal targeting have improved outcomes in multiple cancers 
(84), but little is known on how to streamline these methods to provide maximum benefit. 
Here, we demonstrate that transient priming of primary and secondary sites via ROCK 
inhibition improves chemotherapy efficacy and retards the onset of metastasis in PC.
Mechanoreciprocity and host tissue properties play a vital role in nascent tumors, from 
providing initial survival signals to driving cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis 
(85, 86). Here, we use a combination of 3D in vitro and in vivo platforms with mouse- and 
patient-derived PC cells to guide and optimize tissue manipulation scheduling in the context 
of Gem/Abraxane therapy. Our results suggest that shortterm inhibition of cellular tension in 
the whole tumor tissue before chemotherapy reduces cancer progression and improves 
response to treatment. Despite the distinct composition of the ECM in our different in vitro

 and in vivo models, our data reveal a similar effect in all settings, suggesting that this is a 
general phenomenon for multiple microenvironments. This suggests that depriving cancer 
cells of cues provided by the surrounding matrix at both primary and secondary sites renders 
them more sensitive to cytotoxic drugs, partly via impaired integrin signaling, as previously 
demonstrated in melanoma (67). This is in line with our recent findings that inhibition of 
collagen cross-linking via antibody-targeted therapy against lysyl oxidase in combination 
with Gem effectively impaired PC progression (12). ROCK inhibition also seems to induce 
accumulation of mitotic defects in vivo, potentially making cells more susceptible to 
subsequent chemotherapy (3).
The molecular fingerprint of human PC is highly heterogeneous (29, 82). High-throughput 
SHG analysis of the human ICGC cohort revealed heterogeneity in collagen profiles across 
patients. Using intravital monitoring of chemotherapy efficacy in patient-derived samples, 
we showed a graded response to Fasudil priming strategies relative to the initial fibrillar 
collagen profile in tissue biopsies. Our findings thereby suggest that high amounts of 
fibrillar collagen could potentially serve as a companion biomarker to identify patients who 
are likely to benefit from transient ECM manipulation before chemotherapy. This is in line 
with current clinical stroma-targeting therapies, where such companion biomarkers are being 
used for hyaluronic acid targeting, supporting matrix manipulation therapy in a 
subpopulation of patients (83). Fine-tuned ECM-based stratification could therefore 
facilitate a more tailored therapeutic approach to matrix manipulation therapy in PC and 
could be used as an alternative to the “all patients” chronic stromal targeting approach in this 
disease.
Although we demonstrate disruption of the physical properties of the ECM upon 
manipulation with Fasudil, we also reveal that repurposing Fasudil’s clinical vasodilatory 
effects (28) through transient priming before chemotherapy improves short-term tumor 
blood perfusion and, thereby, drug delivery. This is in line with its current use for the 
treatment of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in Japan (87-89) while 
avoiding any long-term toxic effects that could arise from chronic treatment (36, 39). 
Therefore, targeting ECM-dependent and ECM-independent changes in cancer appears to be 
an important advantage of transient ROCK inhibition compared to chronic ECM targeting 
alone (39, 90, 91) and warrants further consideration with regard to repurposing the off-
patent drugs in PC (92).
Monitoring the onset of hepatic micrometastasis revealed that manipulation of tissue at 
secondary sites impairs liver colonization. Analyses on CDMs and in the liver demonstrated 
that priming with Fasudil alters KPC cell attachment, coordinated movement, and malleable 
spread of the tumor emboli, potentially via changes of the mechanical and biochemical 
properties of the host ECM, thereby altering ECM-cell interactions and durotaxis (93, 94). 
Furthermore, the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway drives path generation by leading tumor cells 
(66, 95), and hence, ROCK inhibition with Fasudil may inhibit path generation and 
coordinated cell movement of tumor cells in this context (95, 96). Additionally, priming with 
Fasudil may decrease cell survival in the bloodstream via impaired tolerance to shear stress 
(97). Whereas previous studies have reported conflicting findings on the effects of ROCK 
inhibition on cell invasion (98-100), short-term treatment with Fasudil did not show adverse

 effects, unlike chronic ROCK targeting. We also reveal that Fasudil priming impairs the 
ability of metastasized cells to create a fibrotic refuge, potentially enhancing their 
vulnerability to subsequent chemotherapy (67). We propose that instead of completely 
ablating stroma–cancer cell feedback, transient priming of tissue by Fasudil before 
chemotherapy can impair cancer cell establishment, survival, growth, and spread at multiple 
sites in vivo while minimizing negative effects that may arise from chronic treatment.
Although Fasudil monotherapy or combinations with selected cardiovascular agents have 
previously been shown to be safe in humans by numerous large-scale studies (87-89), this 
agent is yet to be combined with chemotherapies in the clinic. A phase 1 clinical trial would 
determine the safety of transient “priming” regimen with Fasudil before treatment with 
Gem/Abraxane in patients. Our study used patient TMA material from the ICGC cohort 
(82), which is composed of largely early-stage tumors (I, IIa, and IIb) and hence does not 
equally cover the full spectrum of the disease. Validation studies would ideally include a 
cohort of more metastatic disease to fully appreciate the utility of our proposed SHG 
companion biomarker. Additionally, given the dual effects of Fasudil priming on both the 
ECM and the tumor vasculature, combination of both SHG and CD31-based biomarkers 
might further facilitate the identification of patients who could benefit from priming before 
chemotherapy.
Newer ROCK inhibitors such as K-115 (Ripasudil), which have recently entered the clinic 
for the treatment of glaucoma (101,102) or are currently in the clinical testing pipeline, 
including phase 2 clinical trial for glaucoma (AMA0076) (103), or CCT129254 or AT13148, 
which reduce metastasis in other cancers (104), could also have similar applications (105). 
Patient presentation in PC ranges from early local invasion at the time of diagnosis to late 
metastatic disease (106). We have demonstrated multisite benefits using priming in 
combination with standard-of-care therapy (summarized in fig. S9) and envision its potential 
use to treat PC at several stages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This study interrogates the effect of transient manipulation of tissue tension via ROCK 
inhibition on PC progression and response to Gem/Abraxane. In vitro organotypic and CDM 
experiments were performed in independent biological triplicates, with three technical 
replicates per repeat and per treatment group. For in vivo experiments, numbers of mice used 
for each model are outlined in corresponding figures and figure legends. In vivo priming 
started when tumor volume reached 180 mm3 (average size) or 7 × 105 photons/s (average 
IVIS signal). Mice for which tumor volume or IVIS signal was 10% lower or higher than the 
average value before enrollment were excluded from analysis.
FLIM-FRET analysis of CDK1 and SRC activity in vitro was conducted in >30 cells per 
group in three independent biological repeats. In vivo analysis of CDK1 and SRC was 
performed in 80 cells per mouse, with measurements in three subcellular areas per cell to 
generate an average value for CDK1 specifically, whereas measurements of lifetime in the 
whole cell (one value per cell) were performed for analysis of SRC activity.

 IHC, SHG, picrosirius red, and GLCM analyses were conducted on three representative 
FOVs in organotypic matrices and CDMs and in five representative FOVs in subcutaneous 
xenograft and intrasplenic experiments. Metastatic burden, extravasation, and metastasis 
morphology in the liver were analyzed in serial sections (five sections per organ with a 100-
μm step). Experimental end points for survival experiments were in compliance with Garvan 
Ethics Committee guidelines (13/17, 14/06, 14/11, and 16/13 protocols).
Statistical analysis
Unless stated otherwise, P values were determined by unpaired, nonparametric t test with 
Mann-Whitney U correction (comparison between two groups) or nonparametric ANOVA 
test with Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparison (more than two groups). Kaplan-
Meier curves were compared using a log-rank Mantel-Cox test. Exact P values for all figures 
are provided in table S1.
