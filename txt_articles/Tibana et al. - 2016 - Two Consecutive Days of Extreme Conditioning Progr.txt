The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two consecutive extreme
conditioning program training sessions (24 h apart) designed to enhance work-capacity
that involved both cardiovascular and muscular exercises on cytokines, muscle power,
blood lactate and glucose. Nine male members of the extreme conditioning community
(age 26.7 ± 6.6 years; body mass 78.8 ± 13.2 kg; body fat 13.5 ± 6.2%; training
experience 2.5 ± 1.2 years) completed two experimental protocols (24 h apart): (1)
strength and power exercises, (2) gymnastic movements, and (3) metabolic conditioning
as follows: 10 min of as many rounds as possible (AMRAP) of 30 double-unders
and 15 power snatches (34 kg). The same sequence as repeated on session 2 with
the following metabolic conditioning: 12 min AMRAP of: row 250 m and 25 target
burpees. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and osteoprotegerin were measured before,
immediately post and 24 h after workout of the day (WOD) 1, immediately post, 24
and 48 h after WOD 2. Peak and mean power were obtained for each repetition
(back squat with 50% of 1 repetition maximum) using a linear position transducer
measured before, immediately post and 24 h after WOD 1, immediately post and 24
h after WOD 2. Blood lactate and glucose were measured pre and immediately post
WOD 1 and 2. Although both sessions of exercise elicited an significant increase in
blood lactate (1.20 ± 0.41 to 11.84 ± 1.34 vs. 0.94 ± 0.34 to 9.05 ± 2.56 mmol/l)
and glucose concentration (81.59 ± 10.27 to 114.99 ± 12.52 vs. 69.47 ± 6.97 to
89.95 ± 19.26 mg/dL), WOD 1 induced a significantly greater increase than WOD 2
(p ≤ 0.05). The training sessions elicited significant changes (p ≤ 0.05) in IL-6, IL-10
and osteoprotegerin concentration over time. IL-6 displayed an increase immediately
after training WOD 1 [197 ± 109%] (p = 0.009) and 2 [99 ± 58%] (p = 0.045).
IL-10 displayed an increase immediately after only WOD 1 [44 ± 52%] (p = 0.046),
and decreased 24 and 48 h following WOD 2 (∼40%; p = 0.018) as compared to

pre-exercise values. Osteoprotegerin displayed a decrease 48 h following WOD 2
(∼25%; p = 0.018) as compared with pre intervention. In conclusion, two consecutive
extreme conditioning training sessions increase pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines with no
interference on muscle performance in the recovery period.

INTRODUCTION
Extreme conditioning training programs are a growing exercise
regimen characterized by high intensity, constantly varied,
functional movement (Tibana et al., 2015). Typical workouts
include Olympic lifting (snatch, clean, and jerk), power lifting
(squat, deadlift, press/push press, bench press), and gymnastic
movements (pull-ups, toes-to-bar, knees-to-elbows, lunges,
muscle-ups, burpees, dips, push-ups, rope climbs; Tibana et al.,
2015). These exercises are often combined into high-intensity
workouts that are performed in rapid, successive repetition, with
limited or no recovery time.
However, high-intensity training modalities have also been
the
subject
of
scrutiny,
with
concerns
of
elevated
risk
of nonfunctional overreaching. Recently, investigators have
demonstrated that a CrossFit bout elicited an acute blood
oxidative stress response comparable to a traditional bout of
high-intensity treadmill running in males with 3 or more months
of CrossFit experience (Kliszczewicz et al., 2015). Similarly,
Szivak et al. (2013) and Heavens et al. (2014) showed in “sister
articles” that a high-intensity short rest protocol (which consisted
of a descending pyramid scheme of back squat, bench press,
and deadlift, beginning with 10 repetitions of each, then 9,
then 8, and so on until 1 repetition on the final set) elicits
significant increases in indirect blood markers of muscle damage
[myoglobin, inteleukin-6 (IL-6) and creatine kinase] and resulted
in exacerbated metabolic (lactate) and adrenal function (cortisol)
activation in men and women with experience in resistance
training. This prolonged response can lead to compounding
physiological stress over consecutive exercise sessions, and can
contribute to a nonfunctional overreaching.
Moreover, it has been shown that repeated intense interval
exercise (three consecutive days of an intermittent run protocol
to exhaustion) elicited significant CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+
lymphocyte cell death and migration after the third day
of running. Considering this immune response, it would
be recommended to incorporate a rest day following two
consecutive days of high-intensity intermittent running to
minimize immune cell modulations and reduce potential
susceptibility to infections (Navalta et al., 2014). Nonetheless,
Tuan et al. (2008) submitted trained runners to treadmill exercise
at 85%VO2max for 30 min daily over 3 consecutive days
and found that high-intensity exercise induced a significant
dysfunction of the mitochondrial energy status in peripheral
blood immune cells, which was accompanied by an increased
propensity for apoptosis and an increase in tumor necrosis
factor-alpha.
These alarming physiological responses, training complexity
and huge numbers of individuals taking part in such exercise
activities increases the need for studies to evaluate the effect
of this mode of activity on the immune and metabolic system.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze two
consecutive extreme conditioning sessions on IL-6, IL-10,
osteoprotegerin, muscle power, blood lactate and glucose in
trained men. The initial hypothesis is that two such consecutive
sessions exacerbate cytokine responses accompanied by muscle
power impairment.
METHODS
Experimental Approach to the Problem
This study was designed to compare the effects of two different
extreme conditioning sessions on cytokines, metabolic and
neuromuscular responses in trained, adult men. In this study,
the workouts of the day (1 vs. 2) were independent variables,
while the dependent variables consisted of the changes in IL-
6, IL-10, IL-10/IL-6 ratio, OPG, lactate, blood glucose, and
mean power (Figure 1). The responses of cytokines, lactate,
blood glucose, and mean power was assessed before and
immediately post following workouts of the day and following
24 h (cytokines and mean power) and 48 h (cytokines) after
workout of the day 2. The extreme conditioning sessions 1
(predominantly Olympic lifting) and 2 (body weight exercises)
consisted of performing strength and gymnastic exercises paired
with endurance intensive efforts (Chamari and Padulo, 2015).
This design allowed us to individually assess the influence of
different extreme conditioning sessions on immune response in
our cohort of adult men.
Subjects
Nine members of the extreme conditioning program community
(age 26.7 ± 6.6 years) were recruited through advertisements.
Subject characteristics are presented in Table 1. All subjects were
free of injury and known illness, were not using drugs to enhance
performance, and had a minimum of 6 months of extreme
conditioning training. Moreover, they were interviewed by the
researcher and reported to have previous experience in resistance
strength training and cardiovascular training experience before
practicing extreme conditioning workouts. Subjects were advised
to refrain from ingesting caffeine and alcohol for 24 h before
all tests, avoid any exercise in the 48 h before the experimental
sessions, and to maintain their normal daily diet during the
study.
All participants signed an informed consent document
and the study was approved by the University Research
Ethics Committee for Human Use and conformed to the
Helsinki Declaration on the use of human subjects for
research.

Training Session Days
Subjects completed 2 training sessions 24 h apart (Table 2). In
workout of the day 1, subjects completed: (a) five sets of one
repetition of snatch from the block at 80% of one-repetition
maximum (1RM) with 2–5 min of rest intervals; (b) 3 sets of
5 Touch & Go Snatches (full) at 75% of 5RM with 90 s of rest
between sets; (C) 3 sets of 60 s of weighted plank hold with 90 s
of rest; After the third set of the aforementioned exercises, 5
min of rest was allowed and then endurance conditioning was
performed with 10 min of as many rounds as possible (AMRAP)
30 double-unders and 15 power snatches (34 kg; Padulo et al.,
2015).
In workout of the day 2, subjects completed: (a) five sets
of one repetition of clean and Jerk from the block at 80% of
1RM with 2–5 min rest intervals; (b) 3 sets of 5 touch and go
cleans (full) with 70% of 5RM with 2–5 min rest; (c) 3 sets
of 10 strict hand standing push-ups; After the third set of the
aforementioned exercises, 5 min of rest was allowed, followed by
endurance conditioning with 12 min AMRAP of rowing (250 m,
Concept) and 25 target burpees.
The goal of the endurance conditioning sessions were to
complete each training session in the quickest time possible,
without compromising exercise technique.
Cytokines and Blood Lactate and Glucose
Concentration
Participants reported to the laboratory between 08:00 and 10:00
a.m., and blood samples (15 mL) were drawn from the antecubital
vein into vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, Brazil). Samples
were then centrifuged at room temperature at 2500 rev. min−1 for
15 min. All subjects were encouraged to avoid smoking, alcohol
and caffeine consumption to avoid influence on these parameters.
The serum was removed and frozen at −80◦C for further
analysis. Serum was analyzed for amyloid A using a DADE
Dimension RXL clinical chemistry analyzer (Dade-Behring, Inc,
Newark, DE, USA). The analyzer was calibrated daily using
Liquid-Assayed Multiqual (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and
two levels of quality control with known concentrations. In
addition, serum IL-10 and IL-6 were assessed using commercially
available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits
(BioLegend’s ELISA Max Deluxe, San Diego, CA, USA) and
osteoprotegerin (R&D System Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Standard curves were generated using commercially available
microplate reader-compatible statistical software (MicroWin
2000, Microtek Laborsysteme GmbH, Overath, Germany). All
samples were determined in duplicate to guarantee the precision
of the results. For all measures the mean intra-assay coefficient
of variation was 2.9–9.5%, the inter-assay coefficient of variation
was 5.9–7.0%, and the sensitivity was 0.0093 pg/mL.
Standard procedures were followed for blood lactate and
glucose collection, management and analysis (Goodwin et al.,
2007). Blood samples (25 µL) were collected from the earlobe
during a rest period (before) and after each experimental
procedure.

and calibration followed the manufacturer’s specifications. The
equipment was attached to the barbell during the back squat (5
repetitions of 50% of 1RM; Cormie et al., 2007; Tibana et al.,
2016) to register the time and the displacement at a frequency of
100 Hz. Subsequently, peak and average power (watts) produced
during the concentric contraction were determined by the
manufacturer’s software (version 4.0.4.6; Peak Power software
analysis).
Statistical Analysis
The data are expressed as mean value and standard deviation
(SD). The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to check for normality
distribution of study variables. A repeated measures ANOVA
was used to compare cytokines, OPG and power between time
points. Compound sphericity was verified by the Mauchley test.
When the assumption of sphericity was not met, the significance
of F-ratios was adjusted according to the Greenhouse-Geisser
procedure. Tukey’s post-hoc test with Bonferroni adjustment was
applied in the event of significance. Paired sample t-tests were
used to compare cytokines and OPG changes (post–pre and % of
change) between training sessions. Pearson’s correlation was used
to explore the relations between cytokines and power variables.
Based on alpha error of 0.05 and a power (1 – β) of 0.80, the
sample effect size f was 0.65 for IL-6, 0.32 for IL-10, 0.49 for IL-
10/IL-6 ratio, and 0.20 for OPG. The level of significance was p ≤
0.05 and SPSS version 20.0 (Somers, NY, USA) software was used.
RESULTS
The physical characteristics of the subjects are presented in
Table 1. Body fat and blood pressure were considered to be
within normal range. Although both sessions of exercise elicited
a significant increase in blood lactate and glucose concentrations,
exercise training 1 induced a significantly higher increase than
exercise training 2 (Figure 2).
Figure 3 presents the time line of cytokines and OPG,
corresponding to pre and post WOD 1, 24 h after WOD 1, post
WOD 2, 24 h and 48 h after WOD 2. The training sessions elicited
statistically significant changes (p ≤ 0.05) in IL-6, IL-10, IL-10/IL-
6 ratio, and OPG concentration over time. IL-6 concentration
presented a statistically significant increase immediately after
WOD 1 (p = 0.009) and 2 (p = 0.045). However, 24 h after
WOD 1 and 2, IL-6 concentration was not statistically significant
different (P > 0.05) from pre intervention values (Figure 3A).

lower values of IL-10/IL-6 ratio immediately after WOD 2 when
compared to training session 1. IL-10/IL-6 ratio after 24 and 48 h

48 h after WOD 2 was significantly lower (p = 0.012) than the
pre intervention concentration (Figure 3D). When comparing
the training responsiveness, there were no significant differences
(p > 0.05) on absolute (post–pre training session) or percentage

(Table 3).
The mean change (% from baseline) of cytokines and OPG
24 h and 48 h after WOD 2 are shown in Figure 4. IL-

(∼40%; p = 0.018) 24 and 48 h after WOD 1. OPG concentration
had a statistically significant decrease (∼25%; p = 0.018) only 48
h after WOD 2. The changes of IL-6 and IL-10/IL-6 ratio were
not statistically significant. There was a statistically significant
correlation between IL-10 and OPG 24 h after WOD 2 (r = 0.833;
p = 0.039).
Figure 5 presents the time line of power, corresponding to
pre and post WOD 1, 24 h after WOD 1, post WOD 2 and

decrease (p < 0.05) immediately after the training sessions.
However, 24 h after, mean power was not statistically significant
different (p > 0.05) from pre intervention. Peak power was
statistically significant higher (p < 0.05) 24 h after WOD 2
than pre intervention. No correlations were observed (p > 0.05)
between cytokines or OPG and power variables.
DISCUSSION
The main findings of this study were: (a) a single bout
of extreme conditioning training provoked high metabolic
responses following both sessions, as reflected by significant
increases in lactate and glucose concentrations; (b) the training
sessions elicited significant increases in IL-6 (WOD 1: 197 ±
109% and WOD 2: 99 ± 58%), IL-10 displayed an increase
immediately after WOD 1 (44 ± 52%) and decreased 24 and
48 h following WOD 2, while OPG decreased 48 h after
WOD 2; (c) although not statistically significant, IL-10/IL-
6 decreased 24 h (∼50%) and 48 h (∼50%) after WOD 2
when as compared with baseline; (d) the increase in pro/anti-
inflammatory cytokines following extreme conditioning training
sessions was not accompanied by a decline in muscle power 24 h
after WOD 2, partially confirming the initial hypothesis.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
analyze the effects of two different extreme conditioning training
sessions on metabolic response (lactate and blood glucose),
cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, and Osteoprotegerin) and muscle power
in trained men, lending utility to the exercise prescription for

preventing nonfunctional overreaching. The results reported in
the present study are in agreement with other investigations
that observed significant metabolic and inflammatory stress
following extreme conditioning training. For example, Szivak
et al. (2013) and Heavens et al. (2014) showed in companion
articles that a high-intensity with short rest protocol (which
consisted of a descending pyramid scheme of back squat,
bench press, and deadlift, beginning with 10 repetitions of
each, then 9, then 8, and so on until 1 repetition on the final
set) elicits a significant increase in muscle damage (myoglobin
and creatine kinase), inflammation (IL-6 immediately post of
exercise for men: ∼3 pg/mL; women: ∼3.5 pg/mL) and produced
hyperreactions in metabolic (lactate immediately post exercise
for men: ∼14 Mmol.L-1; women: ∼9.1 mmol.L-1) and adrenal
function (cortisol) in men and women with experience in
resistance training, but not in extreme conditioning training.
Furthermore, Kliszczewicz et al. (2015) found that the
CrossFit bout (“Cindy” protocol consisting of as many rounds
possible of 5 pullups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air-squats in 20
min) elicited an acute increased on blood oxidative stress (lipid
peroxides 1 h post-exercise: CrossFit = ∼ +143% vs. Treadmill
= ∼ +115%), a decrease on total enzymatic antioxidant capacity
immediately post exercise (CrossFit = ∼−10% vs. Treadmill
= ∼−12%), produced high cardiovascular demands at 20 min
(CrossFit = ∼97% of maximum heart rate vs. Treadmill = ∼93%
of maximum heart rate) and resulted in a greater rating of
perceived exertion (CrossFit = ∼9 vs. Treadmill = ∼7) response
comparable to a traditional bout of high-intensity treadmill
running (run at a minimum intensity of the 90% maximal HR) in
males with a minimum of 3 months CrossFit training experience.
Similarly, in the present study both extreme conditioning
training sessions elicited significant increases in IL-6 (∼6 pg/mL)
and lactate (1.20 ± 0.41 to 11.84 ± 1.34 and 0.94 ± 0.34 to
9.05 ± 2.56 mmol/l) response comparable with the results of
Heavens et al. (2014) (IL-6 immediately post of exercise for men:
∼3 pg/mL) and Szivak et al. (2013) (lactate immediately post
of exercise for men: ∼14 mmol/l). However, different from the
present study, Szivak et al. (2013) and Heavens et al. (2014)
used subjects with no experience with extreme conditioning
training and the protocol was limited to a single training
session, which does not accurately reflect the general daily
practice of such training. In response to exercise, circulating
levels of IL-6 increase up to 100-fold, when long duration
and high intensity exercise is performed (Ostrowski et al.,
2000; Suzuki et al., 2003; Reihmane et al., 2013). Initially, IL-
6 was considered as an immunomodulatory cytokine produced
predominantly by leukocytes as an inflammatory response to
exercise-induced muscle damage (Bruunsgaard et al., 1997).
When it was shown that IL-6 release can be affected by the
bioavailability of carbohydrates (Nieman et al., 2003), it was
suggested that IL-6 could improve skeletal muscle energy supply
(Petersen and Pedersen, 2005). Moreover, exercise provokes an
increase primarily in IL-6, followed by an increase in IL-1ra and
IL-10 (Petersen and Pedersen, 2005).
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine
normally released locally from immune cells to help resolve
inflammation, and is best characterized for its ability to inhibit
macrophage activation (Moore et al., 2001). IL-10 also prevents
cytokine synthesis by posttranscriptional mechanisms, as shown
in human macrophages where the inhibition of IL-1α, IL-1β,

and TNF-α release induced by LPS is a direct consequence of
mRNA degradation of their corresponding genes (Petersen and
Pedersen, 2005). In this sense, in the present study the response of
IL-10 concentration presented a statistically significant increase
immediately after only training session 1 (44 ± 52%). But 24 h
after training session 1, post training session 2, 24 and 48 h after
training 2, IL-10 concentrations were not statistically significant
different (P > 0.05) from pre intervention. Interestingly, we
evaluated the balance between Th2 and Th1 response with IL-
10/IL-6 ratio, and this parameter showed a decrease of ∼50%,
24 and 48 h after the session 2 when compared to baseline
demonstrating a disruption in the balance of pro and anti-
inflammatory cytokines following extreme conditioning program
training.
With regard to OPG, it is a cytokine member of the TNF
receptor superfamily that binds to two ligands, the receptor
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), a key
cytokine for the differentiation of osteoclasts, and a ligand related
to the induction of apoptosis (TRAIL), involved in immune
surveillance. Although clinical results confirm that OPG is an
active cytokine in a wide range of diseases (osteoporosis, arthritis,
vascular calcification, bone cancer related disease; Sasso et al.,
2015), there are still conflicting results regarding OPG and
exercise. For example, Pereira et al. (2013) showed that an acute
resistance training session (3 sets of 10 repetitions in whole body
exercises with 60% of 1RM) induced no additional increase in
pro-inflammatory cytokines nor a decrease in anti-inflammatory
cytokines and OPG (measured before, immediately post and
60 min after exercise) in women with or without Metabolic
Syndrome. On the other hand, Mezil et al. (2015) found that
high intensity exercise (12 min on a cycle ergometer) of six
1-min intervals separated by 1-min rest intervals stimulates
a rapid increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1a: 40,3%;
IL-1b: 41,3%; IL-6: 70%; and TNF-a: 76%) followed by a
decline 24 h later, resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels
below baseline value. No significant exercise-induced changes in
IL-10 were observed. Nevertheless, at 5 min post-exercise, OPG
increased from baseline (13.5%), at 1 and 24 h post-exercise
the values decreased. Furthermore, they observed a positive
correlation between the percent decline in OPG and IL-10 at 24
h post-exercise in comparison to their values at 5 min and 1 h.
However, the main difficulties in comparing our results with
previously published studies are that most studies were limited
regarding the time-course analyses (1–24 h post exercise) of
OPG and different exercise (resistance training vs. high intensity
interval training) protocols were used. Nevertheless, individuals
involved with any high intensity functional movement training
program should be aware of these exacerbated cytokine responses
to avoid functional overreaching, regardless of muscle power
recovery.
Some limitations of the present study should be highlighted,
such as the reduced number of individuals, lack of diet control
and the absence of female participants and upper limb power
measures. Finally, conducting a session with only 24 h of
recovery may have been influenced the response of cytokines on
subsequent WOD. Therefore, further studies comparing different
intensities and WOD with adequate recovery days are needed
to elucidate these answers. Nonetheless, future studies including
muscle biopsies could improve understanding of the muscle
environment and not only select systems such as the immune or
metabolic systems.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, 2 consecutive days of extreme conditioning
program training elicited a significant decrease in anti-
inflammatory cytokines without impairments in muscle power.
Further training and longitudinal investigations are necessary to
determine the consequences of this finding. While we observed
no negative effect on muscular power, it is still recommended that
caution be exercised due to the suppressive effect 2 consecutive
days of extreme conditioning program training had on the
immune system. While future research is needed to determine
the significance of this result, it is recommended that the
incorporation of lower intensity sessions and/or resting days
would help to minimize immune disturbances. This could be a
particularly useful training strategy for individuals who are in
an immunocompromised status (such as a chronic stress state,
or returning from an acute bout of illness), or during specific
parts of the year in which viruses tend to weaken the immune
system.
