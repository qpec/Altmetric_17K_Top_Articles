Abstract
Background and objectives Community-acquired infections are common, contributing to adverse outcomes and
increased health care costs. We hypothesized that, with lower eGFR, the incidence of community-acquired
infections increases, whereas the pattern of site-specific infections varies.
Design,setting,participants,&measurementsAmong1,139,470healthcareusers(meanage=52618yearsold,53%
women) from the Stockholm CREAtinine Measurements Project, we quantified the associations of eGFR with the
risk of infections, overall and major types, over 12 months.
ResultsAtotalof106,807countsofinfectionswererecordedthroughout1,128,313person-years.Theincidence rate

per 1.73 m2 to 419/1000 person-years for individuals with eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Compared with eGFR of
90–104 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the adjusted incidence rate ratios of community-acquired infections were 1.08 (95%
confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.14) for eGFR of 30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and 1.53 (95% confidence interval, 1.39 to
1.69) for eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The relative proportions of lower respiratory tract infection, urinary tract
infection, and sepsis became increasingly higher along with lower eGFR strata (e.g., low respiratory tract infection
accounting for 25% versus 15% of community-acquired infections in eGFR,30 versus 90–104 ml/min per 1.73 m2,
respectively). Differences in incidence associated with eGFR were in general consistent for most infection types,
except for nervous system and upper respiratory tract infections, for which no association was observed.
Conclusions This region-representative health care study finds an excess community-acquired infections
incidence in individuals with mild to severe CKD. Lower respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and
sepsis are major infections in CKD.

Introduction
CKD is common, with a population prevalence of 5%–
15% in most developed countries (1,2), and it is
associated with a markedly increased risk of death
and hospitalizations (3,4). Infections are probably the
most significant and serious noncardiovascular compli-
cations among persons with CKD (https://www.usrds.
org/adr.aspx) (5). Decreased kidney function leads to
retention of metabolic waste products and alteration of
multiple pathways, including the immune system (6).
In patients undergoing dialysis, the risks of fatal
and nonfatal infections are markedly high (7–9), and a
few studies have shown that mildly to moderately
decreased kidney function is also associated with
increased risk of infections (10–15). However, almost
all of these studies focus on mortality or hospitaliza-
tion due to infections, including both nosocomial and
community acquired (10–15).
Community-acquired infections account for consid-
erable morbidity and mortality as well as substantial
health care costs worldwide (16–18), but a compre-
hensive analysis on the risk of infections and possible
differences in their proportions across the full spec-
trum of kidney function is lacking. Such an analysis
would inform health care policymakers about appropri-
ate prevention strategies and health service planning in
the context of CKD. In this study, we hypothesized
that, with lower eGFR, the incidence of community-
acquired infections increases, whereas the pattern of
specific infections varies.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
We used data from the Stockholm CREAtinine
Measurements (SCREAM) Project (2,19). Briefly, the
SCREAM Project is a health care utilization cohort
from the region of Stockholm, Sweden, and it includes
all residents who undertook at least one measurement
of serum creatinine in ambulatory or hospital care
during 2006–2011. Creatinine and other laboratory
data were linked with regional and national admin-
istrative databases for information on health care
utilization, dispensed drugs, validated RRT end
points, and follow-up for death, with virtually no or
minimal loss to follow-up. Given the commonness of
creatinine testing, the SCREAM Project captured 66%
of the complete population census of the region,

 including .75% of individuals above the age of 45 years old
(19). For this study, index date was determined by the first
available serum creatinine measurement of any adult (.18
years old) (Supplemental Figure 1). Exclusion criteria were
creatinine measurement during a hospital stay, pregnancy
(defined by the presence of an International Classification of
Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10]
code among Z321, Z33–Z38, and any O code in the
preceding 6 months), presence of chronic infections (in-
cluding HIV; ICD-10 codes B15–B19, B20–B24, and A15–
A19), or undergoing RRT (dialysis or history of kidney
transplantation as ascertained by linkage with the Swedish
RenalRegistry(http://www.medscinet.net/snr/) (Supplemental
Material). To avoid selecting creatinine values that may be
determined by preexisting infections, we excluded serum
creatinine measurements with a diagnosis of infection during
the preceding 3 months (definitions of infection are
in Supplemental Table 1).
Exposure and Covariates
The exposure was eGFR calculated from serum creati-
nine using the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
Collaboration equation (20). All creatinine measurements
were standardized to isotope dilution mass spectrometry
standards. Although data for ethnicity were not available
by law, misclassification of eGFR is expected to be minimal,
because the vast majority of the residents of the Stockholm
region are of white origin (21). Five categories of eGFR
were studied: eGFR$105, 90–104, 60–89, 30–59, and ,30
ml/min per 1.73 m2, with eGFR of 90–104 ml/min per
1.73 m2 serving as the reference group for consistency
with a previous publication in a comparable health care
extraction from Canada (11) and because this range
showed the lowest risk of the study outcome.
Other covariates were defined at index date of the first
recorded serum creatinine measurement and included age,
sex, and comorbidities on the basis of ICD-10 codes (car-
diovascular disease [composite of myocardial infarction,
congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and
cerebrovascular disease], dementia, chronic pulmonary dis-
ease, rheumatic disease, peptic ulcer disease, liver disease,
hemiplegia or paraplegia, cancer, and diabetes according to the
domains of the Charlson comorbidity score [22,23] as well as
the presence of hypertension). Comorbidities, such as diabetes
and hypertension, were enriched with the current purchase of
related medication (purchase of oral antidiabetics: Anatomic
Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] code A10; or antihypertensives:
ATC codes C03, C07, C08, and C09) up to 6 months before
index date. We also included information on recent/current
use of immunosuppressive drugs (ATC code L04), antibiotics
(ATC codes J01, D06AA, and D06AX), antimycotic (ATC code
J02), or antivirals (ATC code J05) in the 6 months preceding
study start (i.e., precedes serum creatinine measurement/
index date). Of note, the dispensation of these drugs in
Swedish pharmacies is exclusively done via medical prescrip-
tion (Supplemental Table 2).
Study Outcome
Participants were followed from index date to the end of
follow-up (12 months, death, RRT, or migration from the county,
whichever occurred first), and these events were taken into
account when calculating individual time at risk. We chose
this follow-up to reduce possible misclassification bias and
assumed that eGFR remained stable during this short period.
The primary outcome was the overall incidence of community-
acquired infections, including upper and lower respiratory
tract infections, gastrointestinal tract infections, urinary tract
infections (UTIs), skin/soft tissue infections, nervous system
infections, sepsis, musculoskeletal system infections, and
cardiovascular system infections (Supplemental Table 1) di-
agnosed in health care (at primary care, outpatient specialist
consultation, or primary hospitalization diagnosis). The sec-
ondary outcome was the incidence of type-specific infections.
To avoid overestimation from repeated attendance for the
same infection, repeated diagnostic codes recorded within 28
days of one another were attributed to a single episode of
infection, and the date of appearance of the first code was
selected as the event date. We further excluded infections
likely to be acquired in hospital, which encompassed post-
surgical infections, central line–associated bloodstream in-
fections, catheter-associated UTIs, and ventilator-associated
pneumonia ICD-10 diagnoses (a list of excluded codes is
detailed in Supplemental Table 3); in addition, infections
diagnosed in the 14 days after a hospital discharge were also
considered hospital-acquired infections and excluded.
Data Analyses
We present descriptive values as mean and SD or count
with proportion. We calculated crude incidence rates with
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using the exact method
and adjusted incidence rates and incidence rates ratios (IRRs)
using a zero-inflated negative binomial model to account for
overdispersion and excess zero counts. We also included an
offset term in the model to account for time at risk. Covariates
included in the model were age in categories; sex; and use of
immunosuppressive medication, antibiotics, antimycotics,
and antivirals as well as the abovementioned comorbidities.
As sensitivity analyses, we (1) modified the definition of the
timeframe for counting infections to up to 3 months from
inclusion date and to 3–12 months from inclusion date and (2)
repeated the main analysis in specific subgroups defined by
age ($75, 65–74, 45–64, and ,45 years old), sex, diabetes
(yes/no), and history of cancer (yes/no). We performed the
sensitivity analysis to explore whether unknown disease not
captured by our ICD-10–based definitions may have influ-
enced the serum creatinine levels (hence biasing the resulting
GFR estimation) and at the same time, may be responsible
for the infection risk observed. In that case, the pattern of 3
versus 3–12 months infection risk prediction would differ. All
analyses were performed using R (https://www.r-project.
org) and Stata, version 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
The study cohort consisted of 1,139,470 participants
(Supplemental Figure 1) (53% women), with a mean age
of 52618 years old (Table 1). Mean eGFR was 94621 ml/
min per 1.73 m2, 31% of individuals had eGFR$105 ml/
min per 1.73 m2, 30% had eGFR of 90–104 ml/min per
1.73 m2, 32% had eGFR of 60–89 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 6%
had eGFR of 30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and 1% had
eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The most common comor-
bidities were hypertension (present in 25% of the

 population), cardiovascular disease (7%), diabetes mellitus
(6%), cancer (5%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(4%). The remaining comorbidities (rheumatoid disease, de-
mentia, peptic ulcer, liver disease, and hemiplegia paraplegia)
were present in 1% or less of participants. Age, prevalence of
comorbidities, and use of immunosuppressive and antibiotic
medications were higher in lower eGFR categories; antimycotic
and antiviral medications were more common in higher eGFR
categories, and the proportion of women was similar (Table 1).
Crude Incidence Rates and Proportion of Type-Specific
Infections
As many as 17,950 (1.6%) participants died, 211 (0.02%)
initiated RRT, and 3900 (0.34%) migrated from the
region before the end of follow-up. The remaining individ-
uals (98.04%) completed 12 months of follow-up. Overall,
106,807 infectious events were recorded throughout 1,128,313
person-years. The majority of codes (68%) were identified in
ambulatory care (primary care–issued codes, 25%; outpatient
specialist–issued codes, 43%). The crude incidence rate of
infections (any type) was 95/1000 person-years. Incidence
rates were progressively higher across lower eGFR strata:
from 74/1000 person-years for individuals with eGFR=90–
104 ml/min per 1.73 m2 to 419/1000 person-years for
individuals with eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (Table 2).
The most common infections observed were skin and soft
tissue related (crude incidence rate of 28/1000 person-years)
followed by UTIs (21/1000 person-years), lower respiratory
tract infections (15/1000 person-years), upper respiratory
tract infections (11/1000 person-years), and infections of the
gastrointestinal tract (10/1000 person-years). The incidence
rates of all single type–specific infections, with the exception
of upper respiratory tract infections, also increased across
lower eGFR categories (Figure 1, Supplemental Table 4).
The pattern of type-specific infections, however, varied
across eGFR categories (Figure 2A). Specifically, the propor-
tions of UTIs and lower respiratory tract infections were
higher along with lower eGFR categories (from 16% and 15%
in individuals with eGFR=90–104 ml/min per 1.73 m2 to 38%
and 25% in individuals with eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m2,
respectively), and skin/soft tissue–related and upper respi-
ratory tract infections were less common in lower eGFR
categories (from 34% and 14% in individuals with eGFR=90–
104 ml/min per 1.73 m2 to 15% and 2% in individuals with
eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively). For other less
frequent infections (Figure 2B), a similar increasing pattern
was observed for sepsis, and a decreasing proportion of
nervous system infections emerged across lower eGFR strata.
Adjusted Incidence Rates and IRRs
The majority of individuals did not acquire any infection
(93%), 5% of individuals acquired one infection (any type),
and the remaining 2% acquired two or more infections
during follow-up (Table 2). After segregating by eGFR
categories, the proportion of individuals with one infection
increased from 4.5% to 15% across higher to lower eGFR
strata, and the proportion of individuals with two or more
infections likewise increased from ,1% to 5%. We ob-
served an overall adjusted incidence rate of 85 infections
per 1000 person-years, which ranged from 78 to 211
infections per 1000 person-years when stratifying by
eGFR strata.

 IRRs were calculated against the reference category of
eGFR=90–104 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Compared with those
individuals, individuals with eGFR$105 ml/min per
1.73 m2 had an 8% higher adjusted IRR (1.08; 95% CI,
1.03 to 1.14). Individuals with eGFR of 60–89 ml/min per
1.73 m2 did not have a significantly higher adjusted IRR,
and those with eGFRs of 30–59 and ,30 ml/min per
1.73 m2 had 8% (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.14) and 53%
(IRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.39 to 1.69) higher IRRs of infections.
IRRs for single type–specific infections are shown in
Figure 3. Because of low numbers of events, the categories
of infections of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular
systems were not addressed. Compared with the category
of eGFR=90–104 ml/min per 1.73 m2, participants with
eGFR$105 ml/min per 1.73 m2 were at a significantly increased
rate of skin/soft tissue infections. For the other eGFR categories,
we observed, in general, increased IRRs across lower eGFR
strata for the risk of skin/soft tissue infections, sepsis, gastro-
intestinal infections, UTIs, and lower respiratory tract infections,
particularly among individuals with eGFR,30 ml/min per
1.73 m2. No association was observed between eGFR strata and
the risk of upper respiratory tract or nervous system infections.

rates were similar for both men and women but higher
among those with (compared with without) diabetes or
cancer. In all strata considered, a similar U-shape trend was
noted across the broad eGFR spectrum. A higher incidence
rate of infections was noted among the elderly, particularly
among those in the highest eGFR category ($105 ml/min
per 1.73 m2).
Discussion
General Summary
Community-acquired infections are common and carry a
large burden in terms of morbidity and health care costs.
In a large health care utilization cohort of .1 million
Swedes, we report that participants with reduced eGFR
experienced increased risk of infections during 12 months
of follow-up. The incidence rate of major infection types
increased with more severe CKD, but the leading types of
infections varied. Overall, this large and comprehensive
description of changing infection patterns across eGFR can
serve to increase patient and provider awareness, leading
toward improved patient management and more effective
vaccination strategies and health service planning.
Increased Incidence Rates and IRRs
Preceding literature suggests an overall direct relation-
ship between reduced kidney function and infections
requiring hospitalization (10–15). An analysis from the
United Kingdom showed increased incidence of community-
acquired infections for selected types of infections (lower
respiratory tract infections and sepsis) among elderly
patients with diabetes identified in primary care (12). Our
study expands that evidence to the greater community by
analyzing the whole spectrum of infections in ambulatory
consultations.
We observe that the crude incidence of most infection
types increased across lower eGFR strata. Compared with
eGFR values of 90–104 ml/min per 1.73 m2, individuals
with eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 were at higher risk of
most infections. This increased risk was observed for most
infection types, with the exception of upper respiratory
tract and central nervous system (CNS) infections, which
did not clearly associate with eGFR. These are novel
observations for which there is no comparison in the
literature and warrant further confirmation.
The lack of association with upper respiratory tract
infections may be due to patients with CKD being less
prone to getting upper respiratory infections or being
diagnosed with upper respiratory infections. For the
former, high influenza vaccination rates among patients
with CKD in Sweden may be indeed preventing upper
respiratory infection (24). For the latter, it is possible that
patients with CKD are more likely to present with a
complex of symptoms and signs, and thus, the diagnosis by
health care providers may lean toward lower respiratory
infection (25).
For CNS infections, the crude incidence rate is higher in
lower eGFR strata, but these differences were attenuated in
multivariable analysis. CNS infections are rare but the most
severe form of infections, and it is possible that our short
observation period may have limited our power to observe
an association. The risk of gastrointestinal tract infections
was high in magnitude but did not reach statistical
significance, something consistent with a previous study
from the United States (11).
We do not observe a straightforward “dose relationship”
between the risk of lower respiratory tract infections and
the intermediate eGFR strata, which is at odds with two
previous reports showing strong predictions for pneumo-
nia hospitalizations (11,12). Differences in the severity of
the event predicted, clinical practices, participant charac-
teristics, and notably, follow-up (1 year in our study
versus a median of 2.5 [11] and 4.6 [12] years of observa-
tion) may explain this discrepancy.
Finally, the associations between levels of eGFR of 105 ml/
min per 1.73 m2 or greater and higher risk of some types of
infections are also interesting and have been reported in
previous studies (10–12). They are likely a consequence of
inaccurate estimation of true GFR in these individuals due to
low serum creatinine generation as a result of reduced muscle
mass accompanying chronic illness. This is supported by our
sensitivity analyses showing a markedly increased infection
risk among the elderly in the highest eGFR category, pre-
sumably denoting frailty.
Differential Pattern of Infections and Clinical Implications
Disaggregating infection types across eGFR strata is
potentially useful from a clinical perspective, because these
subcategories may require different interventions and
prevention strategies. We observed that UTIs, sepsis, and
lower respiratory tract infections became increasingly
common among individuals with more severe CKD,
whereas the proportions of skin/soft tissue and upper
respiratory tract infections were lower. This is a novel
aspect of our report that may have clinical implications.
Given the fact that CKD remains underdiagnosed and
unrecognized in most societies, including our society (2),
our findings may help clinicians become more aware of
CKD and its complications. This in turn may be useful to
identify patients at increased risk of infection and inform
discussions about infection risk and vaccination strategies.
Infection prevention programs usually target patients on
dialysis and individuals with severe kidney dysfunction
(26–28), whereas our results suggest that these programs
perhaps should be expanded to also include persons with
less severe kidney dysfunction. Furthermore, because CKD
associates with an increased risk of a number of adverse
health outcomes, characterizing the relative distribution of
specific infection types by eGFR category provides a
comprehensive description of the type-specific infection
burden of disease in CKD. This information may be helpful
for prioritizing resource allocation to future interventions.
Plausible Mechanisms
Several health care–related factors and plausible mech-
anisms could explain our findings. It could be postulated
that individuals with CKD might be monitored more
closely and thus, are more likely to be diagnosed with
1406
Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology
 infections compared with those without CKD. However,
infections are, in general, acute conditions with unique
symptoms and signs, and thus, they are less prone to such
an ascertainment bias (15). Also, it is important that associ-
ations remained strong, despite adjustment for age, sex, and
multiple comorbidities. More important is perhaps the fact
that there is a biologic plausibility for the causality in the
associations reported given the well known effect of uremic
toxicity on T lymphocyte and antigen-presenting cells (6) and
the generation of oxidative stress (29), factors that alter both
cellular and humoral immunity. Because it is possible that
additional mechanisms operate in the setting of moderate
kidney disease, it may be worthwhile to pursue additional
experimental studies in the search of underlying reasons.
Strengths and Limitations
The results should be interpreted in view of some unique
strengths and limitations. The most important limitation is
the reliance on ICD-10 diagnoses. The reliability of phy-
sician diagnosis codes may vary across different sites and
severity of infection, raising a particular concern regarding
the ascertainment of upper respiratory tract infections. We
are not aware of any study validating outpatient infection
diagnoses in Sweden. However, a previous study reported
the validity of national inpatient diagnoses in Sweden to be
85%–95% (30). The validity of selected inpatient infections,
namely infection, pneumonia, community-acquired sepsis,
and tuberculosis codes, was found to be of low sensitivity
(,50%) but excellent specificity (.95% in all of them) in
Sweden (31).
This is the largest material so far addressing this topic in
material with a large census population coverage of our
region (19). However, this is a population accessing health
care, and reasons for testing creatinine could also be
confounders. Although the reasons for measurement are
unknown and selected patients may differ from patients
without creatinine measurements, this is unlikely to invalidate
our findings, which are on the basis of a large proportion of
patients from our source population and reflect standard
outpatient clinical practices in a large health care region with
individuals having universal access to health care. Addition-
ally, our analytic design provides a careful quantification of
community-acquired infections by excluding hospitalization-
related codes and avoiding the overestimation from repeated
attendances. We also studied a short 1-year follow-up, which
allows us to assume that eGFR has been rather constant in that
period. That said, our findings are restricted to the region of
Stockholm, Sweden and may not be generalizable to other
populations. Although we excluded participants with recent
infections and controlled for the use of immunosuppressive
and anti-infection medication, our records do not have reliable
information on vaccination status or vaccine purchases,
because they can be done in private practices/centers. In
favor of our findings, however, Scandinavian countries have
the lowest rates of antibiotic consumption and antibiotic
resistance worldwide (32). Because information on protein-
uria was lacking in most patients and we only used one serum
creatinine to estimate GFR, we could not accurately stage
CKD severity and therefore, refer to eGFR strata. Finally,
because of the study design, we cannot assume causality in
the associations reported, and residual confounding is in-
herent to all observational studies.
Among 1.1 million community-dwelling adults access-
ing health care in the region of Stockholm, an independent
graded association was observed between reduced kidney
function and overall incidence of community-acquired
infections. Although associations were consistently seen
for most separate infections, lower respiratory tract infec-
tions, UTIs, and sepsis were the infection types most
markedly linked to a reduced kidney function, exhibiting
the greatest difference in incidence rates and their relative
proportions, in individuals with advanced CKD. Increasing
patient and health care provider awareness of this differ-
ential pattern of risk could have benefits for patient
management, prevention strategies, and health service
planning.
