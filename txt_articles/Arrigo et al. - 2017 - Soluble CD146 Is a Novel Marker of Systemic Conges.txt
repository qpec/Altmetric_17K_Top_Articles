BACKGROUND: Soluble CD146 (sCD146), is an endothe-
lial marker with similar diagnostic power as natriuretic
peptides in decompensated heart failure (HF). While na-
triuretic peptides are released by the failing heart,
sCD146 may be released by veins in response to stretch
induced by systemic congestion in HF. This study inves-
tigated the source, effects of vascular stress on release and
prognostic properties of sCD146 in HF.
METHODS: In a peripheral venous stress study, plasma
concentrations of sCD146 and N-terminal probrain
natriuretic-peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured in 44
HF patients at baseline and after 90 min of unilateral
forearm venous congestion. In addition, sCD146 and
NT-proBNP were measured in peripheral vein (PV) and
coronary sinus (CS) blood samples of 137 HF patients
and the transcardiac gradient was calculated. Those pa-
tients were followed for major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACE) during 2 years.
RESULTS: The induction of venous stress was associated
with a pronounced increase in circulating concentrations
of sCD146 in the congested arm (�60 �g/L) compared
to the control arm (�16 �g/L, P � 0.025), while no
difference in NT-proBNP concentrations was seen. In
contrast to positive transcardiac gradient for NT-
proBNP, median sCD146 concentrations were lower in
CS than in PV (396 vs 434, P � 0.001), indicating a
predominantly extracardiac source of sCD146. Finally,
increased PV concentrations of sCD146 were associated
with higher risk of MACE at 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Soluble CD146 is released from the
peripheral vasculature in response to venous stretch
and may reflect systemic congestion in chronic HF
patients.

Heart failure (HF)9 is one of the leading causes of mor-
tality and is associated with substantial morbidity (1, 2).
Hospital readmissions, mostly due to the presence of or-
gan congestion, are particularly frequent in patients with
chronic heart failure (CHF) and are associated with ad-
verse outcome (3). The congestive cascade, which often
begins several days or weeks before symptom onset, in-
cludes a subclinical increase of venous pressures (“hemo-
dynamic congestion”), which may further lead to redis-
tribution of fluids within the lungs and visceral organs
(“organ congestion”) and finally to overt signs and symp-
toms of volume overload (“clinical congestion”) (4). Sev-
eral strategies for early detection of subclinical organ con-
gestion have been proposed (e.g., daily body weight
measurement, or more recently, intrathoracic impedance
monitoring and implantable hemodynamic monitoring)
(5–8). However, there is still an unmet need for reliable
detection of congestion at an early stage to, hopefully,
reduce hospitalizations and improve outcome.
The use of biomarkers, in particular natriuretic pep-
tides (NPs), was advocated for this purpose (9, 10).
However, concentrations of circulating NPs released by

 the failing heart reflect the severity of myocardial dys-
function and only indirectly systemic congestion (11).
CD146 is a junctional adhesion molecule, expressed
on human vascular endothelial cells and is involved in the
control of vessel integrity (12). The soluble form of
CD146 (sCD146) is generated by ectodomain shedding
of surface CD146 (13), possibly in response to endothe-
lial cell stretch. We recently described circulating
sCD146 as a potential diagnostic biomarker of decom-
pensated HF (14) with similar ability as plasma NPs to
identify cardiac origin of acute dyspnea and associated
organ congestion (15).
While NPs are quasi-exclusively released by failing car-
diac myocytes, the main source of plasma sCD146 in HF
remains undefined. We hypothesized that, differently from
NPs, sCD146 might have a predominant vascular, extracar-
diac origin in HF patients and its release might be triggered
by vascular endothelial stretch induced by congestion. In
this context, we investigated (a) the source, (b) effects of
vascular stress on release, and (c) prognostic properties of
sCD146 in severe chronic HF patients.
Methods
STUDY POPULATION
The study population consisted of 181 stable chronic HF
patients, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional
class II–IV with reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF). A first cohort of patients (n � 44) underwent a
mechanistic “peripheral venous stress study” aimed at inves-
tigating the effect of venous congestion on sCD146 release.
A second cohort of patients (n � 137) underwent the
“transcardiac gradient clinical study,” where coronary sinus
(CS)andperipheralvein(PV)bloodsampleswereobtained,
to assess the source (cardiac vs extracardiac) of sCD146 and
its long-term prognostic value.
PERIPHERAL VENOUS STRESS STUDY
Peripheral venous stress was created by inflating a pres-
sure cuff around the dominant arm (test arm), increasing
venous arm pressure up to 30 mmHg above baseline
irrespective of arterial pressure in chronic HF outpatients
without clinical evidence of congestion on physical exam
and on stable medical therapy, as previously described
(16). Venous lactate has been previously shown to remain
stable during the venous stress test, suggesting adequate per-
fusion (16). Blood was sampled through an indwelling ve-
nous catheter from the antecubital or basilic vein of the test
arm after 90 min and from the control contralateral arm
(lacking an inflated cuff) at baseline and after 90 min. Arte-
rial oximetry and forearm circumference were measured at
baseline and after 90 min of venous congestion. This study
was performed at the Columbia University Medical Center
(New York), inclusion and exclusion criteria are summa-
rized in Table S1 in the Data Supplement that accompanies
the online version of this article at http://www.
clinchem.org/content/vol63/issue1.
TRANSCARDIAC GRADIENT CLINICAL STUDY
Blood of chronic HF patients undergoing cardiac resyn-
chronization therapy (CRT) device implantation was
drawn from the CS through the guiding catheter before
delivering the CS lead, and simultaneously, from 1 of the
upper extremity veins (PV blood). Baseline characteris-
tics, including medical history, 12-lead electrocardiogra-
phy, and 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography
were documented. Patients returned for regular clinic
visits at 1, 3, and 6 months after device implantation and
were followed for events up to 2 years. Major adverse
cardiovascular event (MACE) was defined as the com-
posite endpoint of death, cardiac transplant, left ventric-
ular assist device (LVAD) implantation, and HF hospi-
talization at 2 years. An outcome panel consisting of 2
cardiologists, blinded to the biomarker results, deter-
mined the clinical response of each patient based on re-
view of the medical record, with disagreement resolved
by consensus with a third cardiologist. This study, per-
formed at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston), has
been previously described in detail (Clinical Trials.gov
number NCT01949246), inclusion and exclusion crite-
ria are summarized in the online Supplemental Table S2
(17).
BLOOD SAMPLES STORAGE AND ANALYSIS
All samples were centrifuged within 6 h, and the aliquot
portions of EDTA plasma were stored in microcentrifuge
tubes at �80 °C until assayed in a standardized way.
Deidentified samples were sent to an independent
core laboratory for analysis. Measurements of concentra-
tions of N-terminal probrain natriuretic-peptide (NT-
proBNP) were performed using a 1-step sandwich
chemiluminescent immunoassay (Cobas, Roche Diag-
nostics) with detection limit of 5 ng/L and coefficients of
variation for both repeatability and reproducibility
�3.5% in the measured range. Concentrations of
sCD146 were determined by ELISA (CY-QUANT
ELISA sCD146�, Biocytex) with detection limit of
sCD146 of 10 �g/L and coefficients of variation for both
repeatability and reproducibility �20% in the measured
range.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Continuous variables are expressed, after testing for nor-
mality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, as mean (SD) or me-
dian (interquartile range), as appropriate. Nominal vari-
ables are expressed as frequency (percentages). The
Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to examine the dif-
ferences between the transcardiac gradients of CS and PV
samples and the differences between test and control arm
before and after venous congestion. Differences between

 2 independent groups were assessed with a t-test, Wil-
coxon rank sum test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards mod-
els were used to evaluate the association of sCD146 and
first occurrence of MACE. Adjustments were performed
for age, sex, LVEF, and estimated GFR. The null hypoth-
esis was rejected with an adjusted 2-sided P value �0.05.
Analyses were performed with the use of IBM SPSS Sta-
tistics, Version 21.0. (IBM Corp) and SAS, Version 9.4.
(SAS Institute Inc).

The study was performed in observance of national laws
and in accordance with the ethical standards of the Dec-
laration of Helsinki, and was approved by local Ethical
Committees. All patients provided written informed
consent.
Results
BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS
The studied stable chronic HF patients, were predomi-
nantly middle-aged men with severely reduced LVEF
and NYHA functional class II–IV (Table 1 and the on-
line Supplemental Table S3). Cardiovascular risk factors
were highly prevalent and ischemic heart disease ac-
counted for at least a third of HF etiologies. Most pa-
tients were treated with disease-modifying therapies ac-
cording to current guidelines (9).
PERIPHERAL VENOUS STRESS STUDY
Baseline concentrations of sCD146 and NT-proBNP
were 454 (339–507 �g/L) and 341 (191–1147 ng/L),
respectively. The induction of venous stress was associ-
ated with a pronounced increase in circulating concen-
trations of sCD146 in the congested arm [�60 (�13;
�102) �g/L] compared to the control arm [�16 (�2;
�64) �g/L, P � 0.025]. After 90 min of venous
congestion, plasma concentrations of sCD146 in the
congested arm and in the control arm were 481 (371;
553) and 442 (374–527) �g/L, respectively. By contrast,
no difference in plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP
in the congested arm [�1.0 (�12; �89) ng/L] compared
to the control arm [�0.9 (�20; �29) ng/L, P � 0.29]
was found (Fig. 1). After 90 min of venous congestion,
plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP in the congested
arm and in the control arm were 308 (218–1140) and
327 (152–1137) ng/L, respectively. Forearm circumfer-
ence of the congested arm increased after venous stress
test from 25.8 to 26.7 cm (P � 0.001) while remaining
unchanged in the control arm (data not shown). Arterial
oximetry of the congested arm after 90 min showed no
difference compared to baseline (97.3 vs 97.5%, P �
0.6), supporting the evidence of maintained perfusion
during venous congestion. There was no clinical adverse
event associated with the peripheral venous stress study.
TRANSCARDIAC GRADIENT CLINICAL STUDY
Transcardiac gradients of NT-proBNP and SCD146
Fig. 2 shows that median NT-proBNP concentrations
were higher in CS than in PV [1814 (742; 3560) vs 1718
(628; 3156) ng/L, P � 0.001], with a positive transcar-
diac gradient (difference between CS - PV) of 237 (43;
653) ng/L. By contrast, median sCD146 concentrations
were lower in CS than in PV [396 (306; 529) vs 434
(339; 587), P � 0.001], indicating a negative transcar-
diac gradient of �31 (�80; 10) �g/L. Concentrations of
NT-proBNP and sCD146 in CS and PV were both as-
sociated with the severity of mitral regurgitation (all P �
0.01, see online Supplemental Fig. 1).
Long-term prognostic value of SCD146. There were 35
(25%) patients with MACE by 2 years, including 14
deaths, 32 HF hospitalizations, 2 patients requiring
LVAD implantation and 3 heart transplants. Fig. 3
shows the association of baseline concentrations of
sCD146 with MACE at 2 years in patients with HF with
CRT. PV plasma concentrations of sCD146 were asso-
ciated with 2-fold increase of adjusted risk of MACE per
log-unit of sCD146, while there was no association be-
tween CS values of sCD146 and MACE. Likewise, less
negative transcardiac gradient (i.e., low PV concentra-
tions) of sCD146 was associated with approximately
40% reduced risk of MACE; this remained true after
various adjustments (Fig. 3), including concentrations of
NT-proBNP (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.36–0.78,
P � 0.001)
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that soluble CD146 has
a predominant extracardiac source and is rapidly released
in the presence of venous congestion. To our knowledge,
this is the first biomarker reflecting systemic venous con-
gestion in chronic HF. In addition, sCD146 exhibits
prognostic value in severe HF patients with CRT.
Surface CD146 plays a central role in endothelial
cell-cell cohesion and vascular permeability (12, 18).
Soluble form of CD146 is generated by active matrix
metalloproteinases
(MMPs)-dependent
ectodomain
shedding of surface CD146 (13). Hence, increased sur-
face CD146 shedding leads to sCD146 release but also to
increased endothelial permeability to many proteins in-
cluding albumin (13, 19). Using unbiased proteomics,
our group previously showed that sCD146 was highly
present in plasma of HF patients (14). The present study
confirmed high circulating sCD146 above the upper ref-
erence limit (19) in HF patients. Though generated by

 endothelial cells, the exact source of sCD146 in HF was
uncertain. The present study strongly suggests extracar-
diac origin of sCD146 in HF patients. Indeed, an in-
crease in pressure in forearm veins raised plasma concen-
trations of sCD146, but not of NT-proBNP, in the
congested arm. Our data are in line with other studies
showing in vivo and in vitro release of endothelial mark-
ers such as endothelin, nitric oxide, prostaglandin after
acute endothelial stretch (13, 16). Our data are also in
line with in vitro/ex vivo studies showing rapid stimula-
tion of MMPs during mechanical stress in the form of
endothelial cell stretching or acute venous occlusion
(20–24). Measures of transcardiac gradient of sCD146
confirmed the predominant extracardiac origin of
sCD146 in our HF patients. In contrast to the positive
transcardiac gradient of NT-proBNP, we observed a neg-
ative transcardiac gradient of sCD146, with plasma con-
centrations in peripheral veins higher than in the coro-
nary sinus of HF patients. This finding strongly suggests
a predominant systemic origin of sCD146 in HF pa-
tients, presumably venous. Whether the negative trans-
cardiac gradient suggests extraction is speculative (17).
Our group previously showed that sCD146 was
higher in HF patients with peripheral edema and/or di-

 lated vena cava than in those with no signs of congestion
(15). The present study further highlights that the sever-
ity of mitral regurgitation was associated with higher
plasma concentrations of sCD146. Since severity of mi-
tral regurgitation is a major determinant of pulmonary
venous congestion, our data further support a strong as-
sociation between plasma concentrations of sCD146 and
HF-induced venous congestion.
The present study further showed that plasma con-
centrations of sCD146 and its transcardiac gradient pro-
vided important long-term prognostic information in pa-
tients with severe HF who were treated with CRT. High
peripheral plasma concentrations of sCD146 were asso-
ciated with greater risk of adverse outcome at 2 years. A
10-fold increase in baseline concentrations of sCD146
was associated with doubled risk of MACE. Our results
are in line with previous studies showing that systemic
congestion is a major determinant of organ dysfunction,
readmissions, and death in HF (25, 26).
Our study might bring several benefits in the man-
agement of HF patients including those with CRT. Early
assessment of the degree of congestion, to adjust diuretic
therapy, is not always easy in HF patients. Various tools
for early, reliable and noninvasive detection of subclinical
organ congestion have been proposed, but, despite many
efforts, data on body weight measurement, congestion
scores, and bioimpedance remain inconclusive (5–
7, 27). Our study shows that sCD146 is a biomarker of
systemic congestion, and possibly of increased endothe-
lial permeability in HF. The diagnostic and prognostic
value of sCD146 and its potential to guide decongestive
therapy in left and right ventricular HF should be vali-
dated in larger, multicenter, prospective cohorts.
Several limitations are noted. This study was per-
formed in chronic HF outpatients with reduced LVEF
and therefore the generalizability of the findings to the
overall HF population requires additional research. The
correlation between plasma concentrations of sCD146
and hemodynamic congestion (right-atrial pressure, left-
atrial or pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure) should be
further investigated, in particular with invasive or nonin-
vasive pressure measurement. Hydrostatic pooling from
diminished flow and/or reduced peptide clearance might
have contributed to the observed changes in sCD146
concentrations after venous stress test. This needs to be
further explored. However, normal oxygen saturation in
the extremities suggests that flow was maintained in the
tested arm and more importantly sCD146 also increased
in the control arm, though to a much smaller extent than
in the congested arm, suggesting that increased secretion
of sCD146 with peripheral spillover from the congested
arm into the systemic circulation is the leading explana-
tion of the observed findings. Cuff inflation during the
venous stress test not only promoted congestion, but nec-
essarily reduced arterial perfusion pressure by impinging
on the brachial artery. However, a reduction in perfusion

 pressure is a typical clinical feature of severe HF where
arterial blood pressure progressively declines (28), thus
making our model even more relevant, from a patho-
physiological standpoint. Of note, this human model of
venous congestion previously has been shown to mimic
on a local scale, notable aspects of the phenotype that is
typical of acute HF such as inflammation, neurohor-
monal and endothelial cell activation (16).
The transcardiac gradient was calculated using the
CS and PV samples, since the collection of aortic blood
sample was not feasible. Although this might limit accu-
racy of measurements, our study was able to demonstrate
a positive gradient for NT-proBNP and, conversely, a
negative gradient of sCD146. The small number of
MACE limits our ability to perform multivariable adjust-
ments beyond 1 additional variable for the transcardiac
gradient study.
In conclusion, sCD146 is rapidly released from the
peripheral vasculature in response to venous stretch and
may reflect systemic congestion in chronic HF patients.
