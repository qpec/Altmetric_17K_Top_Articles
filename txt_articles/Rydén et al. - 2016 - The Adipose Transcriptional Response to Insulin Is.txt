SUMMARY
Metabolically healthy obese subjects display pre-
served insulin sensitivity and a beneficial white adi-
pose tissue gene expression pattern. However, this
observation stems from fasting studies when insulin
levels are low. We investigated adipose gene expres-
sion by 50Cap-mRNA sequencing in 17 healthy non-
obese (NO), 21 insulin-sensitive severely obese
(ISO), and 30 insulin-resistant severely obese (IRO)
subjects, before and 2 hr into a hyperinsulinemic eu-
glycemic clamp. ISO and IRO subjects displayed a
clear but globally similar transcriptional response
to insulin, which differed from the small effects
observed in NO subjects. In the obese, 231 genes
were altered; 71 were enriched in ISO subjects
(e.g., phosphorylation processes), and 52 were en-
riched in IRO subjects (e.g., cellular stimuli). Com-
mon cardio-metabolic risk factors and gender do
not influence these findings. This study demon-
strates that differences in the acute transcriptional
response to insulin are primarily driven by obesity
per se, challenging the notion of healthy obese adi-
pose tissue, at least in severe obesity.
INTRODUCTION
Up to 30% of obese subjects display normal fasting plasma
glucose/lipid levels and normotension, a phenotype referred to
as ‘‘metabolically healthy obesity,’’ which implies that a signifi-
cant proportion of obese individuals may need less vigorous in-
terventions to avoid metabolic/cardiovascular complications
(Bl€
uher, 2010; Karelis, 2008; Primeau et al., 2011; Samocha-
Bonet et al., 2012; Sims, 2001). A hallmark characteristic among
these individuals is high insulin sensitivity. Several studies have
shown that insulin-sensitive obese (ISO) subjects have lower
visceral fat accumulation, less ectopic fat and arterial athero-
sclerosis, higher plasma adiponectin levels, and a more favor-
able inflammation profile than insulin-resistant obese (IRO)
individuals (Bl€
uher, 2010; Karelis, 2008; Primeau et al., 2011;
Samocha-Bonet et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013). It is also well estab-
lished that the two obesity phenotypes differ in the subcutane-
ous white adipose tissue (sWAT) itself (Xu et al., 2013). ISO
individuals have smaller fat cells and less pronounced inflamma-
tion than IRO individuals, which is also reflected at the gene
expression level (Elbein et al., 2011; Qatanani et al., 2013). How-
ever, the transcriptional profiles of sWAT have been investigated
in the fasting state, when insulin levels are low (Elbein et al., 2011;
Qatanani et al., 2013). As insulin is expected to induce profound
alterations in gene expression, it is not clear how such changes
relate to insulin sensitivity and clinical profiles. This has promp-
ted some investigators to determine the transcriptional response
to insulin in sWAT collected before and during hyperinsulinemic
euglycemic clamp for 6 hr. Comparisons in limited numbers of
lean ISO and IRO subjects have reported some between-group
differences (Soronen et al., 2012; Westerbacka et al., 2006).
Although relevant, these studies were not designed to address
the transcriptional response to insulin in subjects matched for
BMI. Thus, in order to fully evaluate the idea of a healthy obese
state, insulin responses need to be determined in obese subjects
discordant in insulin sensitivity and ideally compared with those
in healthy non-obese (NO) subjects.
Although ISO and IRO individuals display different clinical phe-
notypes, it has been a matter of debate whether they also confer
different risks for cardiovascular morbidity and/or mortality (Flint
et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2014; Ortega et al., 2013; Song et al., 2007).
In fact, several recent meta-analyses have refuted the notion that
‘‘healthy obesity‘‘or preserved insulin sensitivity protects against
cardiometabolic complications (Fan et al., 2013; Kramer et al.,
2013; Roberson et al., 2014). These controversies prompted us

 to investigate how gene expression in the sWAT of ISO indi-
viduals
responds
to
insulin
stimulation
(hyperinsulinemia).
Assuming that the ISO group displays a more ‘‘beneficial’’
gene expression profile in the fasting state compared to the
IRO group, we hypothesized that the differences in transcrip-
tional response profiles between the ISO and IRO groups would
be more pronounced upon hyperinsulinemia and that the ISO
group would be more similar to the NO group than the IRO group.
Therefore, we assessed global transcriptional profiles in sWAT
from healthy NO subjects and from obese subjects subdivided
into ISO and IRO groups according to hyperinsulinemic euglyce-
mic clamp measures. Subcutaneous WAT biopsies were taken
before and at the end of the 2-hr clamp. We chose this short
period of hyperinsulinemia in order to evaluate direct transcrip-
tional effects of insulin, assuming that longer duration of stim-
ulation may cause secondary effects on gene transcription.
Samples were analyzed using global transcriptional profiling
with the 50cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) (Takahashi
et al., 2012). CAGE is based on sequencing the 50 end of
mRNA, thereby assessing the transcriptional start sites (TSS)
and their usage (expression) with high resolution and reproduc-
ibility (Kawaji et al., 2014). Adjacent TSSs for presumably the
same transcripts are collapsed into ‘‘tag clusters’’ correspond-
ing to gene promoters (Frith et al., 2008). Individual genes
typically have several tag clusters depending on tissue type (Car-
ninci et al., 2006; Forrest et al., 2014). CAGE provides less biased
results than conventional expression arrays, allows for more in-
depth analysis, and also detects uncharacterized novel gene
transcripts (Suzuki et al., 2009). However, in order to obtain bio-
logically interpretable insights, the present work was focused on
analyses of tag clusters corresponding to annotated genes.
RESULTS
Cohort Description
Clinical data are summarized in Table 1. As expected, there were
major differences in the clinical profile between the NO group
and the obese groups, in particular for the IRO group. Compared
with the ISO group, the IRO group displayed significantly higher
values for waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, fasting
plasma glucose, insulin, and triglycerides, as well as lower
HDL (high-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol. Mean plasma insulin
levels during clamp were also slightly higher in the IRO group.
M values in the NO group were, on average, �40% higher than
those in the ISO group, but there was a considerable overlap
(Figure 1A).
Gene Expression Profiles Are Altered after Insulin
Stimulation for 2 hr in All Subjects
Taking into account the expression data from all the subjects
put together, there was a clear overall expression response
to hyperinsulinemia, including several genes involved in insulin
signaling. Using a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05, we
found 786 CAGE tag clusters to be altered during the clamp
(expressed as fasting divided by hyperinsulinemia; f/hi) (Fig-
ure 1B). Out of these, 493 corresponded to annotated genes,
and there was a more pronounced transcriptional upregula-
tion (641 out of 786 tag clusters; 82%) upon hyperinsulinemia
(i.e., the f/hi quotient was decreased). Eight insulin responding
tag clusters (Figure 1B) corresponded to eight genes in the in-
sulin signaling pathway and included PPP1R3B, PPP1R3C,
PIK3R, and IRS2 (Figure 1C). A subset of these genes
(SREBF1, PIK3R3, and IRS2) was validated by qPCR in the

(Figure 1D).
Global Gene Expression Profiles in NO, ISO, and IRO
Subjects in the Fasting and Hyperinsulinemic States
In the present dataset, it is possible to compare the groups in
several different ways, as outlined in Figures S1A–S1C. Prin-
cipal-component analysis (PCA) for all differentially expressed
tag clusters between groups and conditions, corresponding
to the comparisons in Figure S1B, showed a clear distinction
between the NO group and both obese groups (Figures S2A
and S2B). As expected, the ISO and IRO groups in the fasting
state displayed a higher expression of genes in pro-inflamma-
tory pathways compared with the NO group (data not shown).
When focusing on the actual insulin response, i.e., the changes
from fasting to hyperinsulinemia (f/hi; see comparison in Fig-
ure S1C), the majority of the differentially expressed tag clus-
ters between the ISO group (246 out of 295; 83%) and the
IRO group (190 out of 246; 77%) were upregulated (f/hi; Fig-
ure 2A). Surprisingly, after correction for multiple testing, insulin
altered only the expression of four tag clusters in the NO group,

from the ISO group (Figure 2D). Upon hy-

Analysis of Insulin-Induced Genes in ISO and IRO
Subjects
As indicated for insulin responses in Figure 2 and further sup-
ported by the global comparisons in Figure S2, the predominant
difference between the controls and the IRO and ISO groups ap-
peared to be obesity per se. This made it difficult to assess the
possible differences between the ISO and IRO groups when
including all three groups. To further evaluate what drives the dif-
ferences in insulin-induced transcriptional response in obesity,
we performed a multiple regression analysis of the data from
the obese groups from Figure 2A in relation to individual insulin
sensitivity (i.e., M value) and other, possibly, contributing factors.
This demonstrated that the M value and BMI contributed to the
variations. However, the results were not influenced by gender
or common risk factors such as waist-to-hip ratio, fasting lipid/
insulin levels, pulse rate, or blood pressure (Table 2), indicating
that obesity and insulin sensitivity, rather than associated
cardio-metabolic risk factors, explains the differences in gene

 expression upon hyperinsulinemia. A comparison of the two
obese groups showed that 380 tag clusters (FDR < 0.05), corre-
sponding to 231 genes, were altered in hyperinsulinemia (Fig-
ure 3A; Table S1). Almost half were responding in both the ISO
and IRO groups (161 tag clusters, 42%; 108 genes, 47%), and
among these, the degree of upregulation was more pronounced
in the ISO group (116 out of the 133 upregulated tag clusters,
87%; Figure 3B). The 231 genes mapped to KEGG (Kyoto Ency-
clopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways involved in, e.g.,
metabolic function, insulin signaling/resistance, MAPK signaling,
circadian rhythm, and cancer (Figure 3C). Genes in these path-
ways were found among common as well as ISO- and IRO-
group-associated genes. In order to gain some further insight
into the biological meaning of the findings, a gene ontology
(GO) analysis focusing on biological processes was also per-
formed. This revealed that the top five most significantly en-
riched GO terms (p < 0.05) were response to lipid, cellular
response to lipid, response to organic cyclic compound,
response to steroid hormone, and fat cell differentiation (Table
S2). Because, in the present article, we focused on the effects
of obesity and insulin resistance, we used these two MeSH
(Medical Subject Headings) terms in a PubMatrix (http://
pubmatrix.irp.nia.nih.gov/) search of the genes listed in Table
S1. This revealed 34 ISO- and 27 IRO-enriched genes, as well
as 48 common genes (Figure 3D). The genes (down- or upregu-
lated) displaying the most pronounced differences between the

 ISO and IRO groups are displayed in Figures 3E and 3F. Among
those most prominent in ISO individuals were RORC, RPGR,
KLF9, IRS2, and DDIT4. Those in the IRO group included
PPARGC1 and TAGAP. Expression changes of these seven
genes were confirmed by qPCR (Figure S3). The five most signif-
icant and biologically relevant GO processes for the genes iden-
tified in Figure 3D are summarized in Table 3. The common ones
belonged to biological pathways involved in lipid metabolism
and cell differentiation (e.g., NPC1, PPARGC1B, and CEBPD).
The ISO-enriched genes (e.g., IRS2, TRIB1, and MIDN) were pri-
marily involved in phosphorylation processes, while the genes
significantly altered in the IRO group (e.g., PIK3R1, FOS, and
PPARGC1A) were associated with fat cell differentiation and
cellular stimuli such as responses to endogenous/exogenous
factors.
Influence of Gender
Most of the included subjects were female, but there were men in
the NO and IRO groups. Exclusion of male subjects did not
impact our findings in a major way, as exemplified by PCA plots
(Figures S2D and S2E).
DISCUSSION
Herein, we report findings on global transcriptional profiles in the
sWAT of NO and obese subjects, using a sequencing method
that allows for broader analyses than conventional expression
arrays (Kawaji et al., 2014). We found a clear transcriptional
response to insulin in our global analysis. However, after correc-
tion for multiple testing, this was only significant among the
obese individuals except for four tag clusters in the NO group.
Thus, NO individuals may regulate their short-term insulin
response in WAT in a different way, possibly via post-transcrip-
tional mechanisms. The small effects in NO also exclude the pos-
sibility that we used an insulin infusion rate during clamp that was
too high, potentially masking differences between the ISO and
IRO groups. Because of the strong influence of obesity per se,
it was necessary to omit the NO group in the analyses in order
to allow identification of the differences between the ISO and
IRO groups. Around half of the genes were common for the
ISO and IRO groups, although the magnitude of the insulin
response was more pronounced for the upregulated genes in
the ISO group, most probably reflecting these subjects’ higher
level of insulin sensitivity.
Our analyses identified 108 insulin-responding genes that
were common and 123 that were enriched in either the ISO or
the IRO grooup. This shows that there are small but quantifiable
differences between the ISO and IRO groups in the adipose
response to insulin at the gene expression level. Notably, the
obesity/insulin resistance-linked genes (i.e., with at least one
publication in the literature) constituted less than half (109 out
of 231) of all the insulin-responsive genes in obesity (individual
genes exemplified in Results). The remaining 122 genes may
be of interest in future studies of the pathophysiological mecha-
nisms of insulin action in human WAT. Nevertheless, it should be
stressed that, although statistically significant, the differences
between the ISO and IRO groups were small and primarily of
quantitative nature, supporting the conclusion that the ISO and
IRO groups display a strong similarity, at least in the short-term
response to insulin.
The observation that the two obese phenotypes displayed very
similar insulin responses could provide a clue for why ISO sub-
jects display an increased morbidity and cardiovascular risk,
compared with NO individuals (Fan et al., 2013; Kramer et al.,
2013; Roberson et al., 2014). The sWAT in ISO individuals may
simply not be as metabolically normal as previously believed.
Our present findings are in line with results following weight
reduction induced by low-calorie diet (Viguerie et al., 2012).
This study showed similar improvements in sWAT gene expres-
sion in obese subjects with or without the metabolic syndrome.
Thus, the transcriptional control upon either hyperinsulinemia
or weight loss appears to be very similar in ISO and IRO subjects.
We categorized the obese into ISO or IRO based solely on in-
sulin sensitivity. Currently, there is no consensus on how to
define a ‘‘metabolically healthy obese,’’ phenotype and various
scoring strategies have been used, as reviewed (Bl€
uher, 2010;
Karelis, 2008; Primeau et al., 2011; Samocha-Bonet et al.,
2012; Xu et al., 2013). Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, the
cardio-metabolic risk profile had no influence on our findings.
The obese subjects were subdivided based on the 25th upper
percentile of insulin sensitivity (Hoffstedt et al., 2010). However,
this has no important bearing on the results, as we obtained
similar findings using individual insulin sensitivity values as a
continuous variable (in multiple regression analyses). There is
no consensus on how to express clamp data. We used the
most common way, i.e., M value/body weight. However, correct-
ing M values for lean body mass yielded virtually the same re-
sults. Insulin levels during clamp were slightly higher in the IRO
group than in the ISO group (Table 1). These small differences
can hardly have influenced our findings on gene expression.
Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, fasting insulin levels had no
bearing on the results.
In the present work, we obtained sequencing-based data on
136 samples from 68 individuals. This can be regarded as very

 large numbers, using a genome-wide sequencing technique by
today’s standards. Moreover, based on results from a smaller
study on 40 subjects using CAGE (Persson et al., 2015), our pre-
sent cohort was sufficiently large to detect gene expression dif-
ferences between the three groups. Despite this, we did not have
sufficient statistical power to allow a subgroup analysis of, e.g.,
the influence of different age groups.
There are some caveats with the present study. Because the
obese subjects were scheduled to undergo bariatric surgery,
our results may only pertain to individuals with severe obesity.
We investigated solely sWAT as it is, for obvious ethical reasons,
virtually impossible to obtain visceral WAT biopsies during
clamp. Still, there is no obvious reason to believe that regional
differences in gene expression are important for the present find-
ings. In fact, previous studies of subcutaneous and visceral WAT
have found that the impact of obesity and metabolic status is
very similar in the two regions in the fasting state (Klimca
´ kova
´
et al., 2011). Moreover, studies of visceral WAT would require in-
traoperative fat biopsies during general anesthesia. It has been
convincingly demonstrated that this procedure induces an acute
insulin-resistant state immediately following the incision of the
intra-abdominal wall (Fella
¨ nder et al., 1994). This makes valid as-
sessments of acute insulin responses in any target tissue during
general surgery uncertain. Another aspect is the possibility that
the gene expression response during fasting and hyperinsuline-
mia may differ between sWAT and tissues such as skeletal mus-
cle and liver. However, previous comparisons have shown that
differences in gene expression between BMI-matched individ-
uals discordant in insulin sensitivity are more pronounced in
sWAT than in skeletal muscle (Elbein et al., 2011). Furthermore,

 with regard to influence of gender, the number of men was too
small to allow a detailed comparison in this respect. Again, for
lack of statistical power, we had to keep the male subjects in
the analyses. Nevertheless, gender distribution did not influence
our correlation analysis, and PCA of insulin gene responses in
women was similar to that in all subjects (Figures S2D and
S2E). Therefore, we do not believe that sex impacts on our re-
sults to any significant degree. Finally, because both pre- and
postmenopausal women were included, we cannot exclude
that menopausal state may influence our results. Nevertheless,
as evident from Table 1, the three groups were well matched
for this factor.
In summary, obese subjects with preserved insulin sensitivity
have globally almost the same WAT gene expression response
to insulin as BMI- and body-fat-matched insulin-resistant indi-
viduals. This is independent of cardio-metabolic risk factors,
thereby questioning the notion of a ‘‘healthy obese state,’’ at
least in the sWAT of women with severe obesity. A comparison
with NO subjects confirms that the major factor explaining the
differences in short-term insulin response is obesity per se.
Nevertheless, small but clear quantitative differences in the tran-
scriptional response to insulin in the ISO and IRO groups are
observed that are linked to specific biological pathways
involving, e.g., phosphorylation processes, cellular stimuli, and
fat cell differentiation. The clinical and pathophysiological rele-
vance of these differences will be addressed in additional
studies, which we encourage by making the full tag cluster data-
set publically available. The dataset can also be used for future
studies addressing other gene regulatory mechanisms, e.g.,
those facilitated by specific gene promoters, enhancer usage,
and long non-coding RNAs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Subjects
The 51 obese subjects were enrolled in a clinical trial studying the outcome of
gastric bypass surgery (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01727245). From one obese
patient, sWAT RNA was of insufficient quality, preventing accurate analyses.
Hence, only CAGE data from the remaining 50 subjects are reported herein.
We also recruited 17 healthy never-obese subjects. In this group, RNA quality
was adequate in samples from 15 subjects. Investigations were performed in
the morning after an overnight fast. Height, weight, hip and waist circumfer-
ence, resting pulse rate, blood pressure, and total body fat content by dual
X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) were determined (Arner et al., 2015). Venous
blood was obtained and analyzed by The Karolinska University Hospital’s ac-
credited routine clinical chemistry laboratory. Abdominal sWAT biopsies were
obtained from the paraumbilical region by needle aspiration under local anes-
thesia. Thereafter, a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp was performed as
described previously (Hagstro
¨ m-Toft et al., 2001). An intravenous bolus
dose of insulin (1.6 U/m2 body surface area; Actrapid, Novo Nordisk) was
given, followed by intravenous infusion of insulin (0.12 U/m2 min) for
120 min. Plasma glucose values were measured in duplicate every fifth minute
(HemoCue). Euglycemia was maintained between 4.5 and 5.5 mmol/l (81 and
99 mg/dl) by a variable intravenous infusion of glucose (200 mg/ml). The mean
glucose infusion rate (glucose disposal) between 60 and 120 min was deter-
mined (M value, milligrams of glucose uptake per kilograms of body weight
per minute). Mean plasma insulin at 60 and 120 min of clamp was calculated.
The second sWAT biopsy was obtained from the contralateral paraumbilical
side during the last 5 min of the clamp.
ISO was predefined based on data from a previously published study of
obese women as the 25th upper percentile of the M value (Hoffstedt et al.,
2010). This gave a cutoff value of 4.65 mg/kg/min. Based on this figure, the
50 subjects from which CAGE data could be obtained were divided into two
subgroups: 21 as ISO and 29 as IRO. Expressing M values per lean body
mass instead of total body weight resulted in an identical subdivision, except
that one subject was reclassified from IRO to ISO. Three ISO and nine IRO
patients were on pharmacotherapy against hypertension. One IRO patient
had diet-/lifestyle-treated type 2 diabetes. The study was approved by the
regional ethics board in Stockholm. Informed written consent was obtained
before enrollment.
qPCR
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, real-time qPCR, and analysis of gene expres-
sion (using the DDCt method) were performed as described previously (Gao
et al., 2014). Details on TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) and SyBR
primers (some of which were designed by us but provided by Sigma-Aldrich)
are available upon request. Gene expression was normalized to 18S rRNA
or LRP10.
50Cap Analysis of Gene Expression Profiling and Data Processing
Total adipose RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit
(QIAGEN), followed by RNA up-concentration, which was measured using a
Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA quality was determined
using the bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies). CAGE libraries
were prepared as described previously (Takahashi et al., 2012), with an input of
1,000 ng total RNA. Samples were run individually. Four CAGE libraries with
different barcodes were pooled prior to sequencing and applied to the same
sequencing lane. Libraries were prepared in a random order to avoid system-
atic errors, as described previously (Takahashi et al., 2012), and sequenced
using Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 or 2000. Sequenced reads were mapped to the hu-
man genome using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009). Nearby mapped reads on
the same strand were merged into 35,639 tag clusters (genomic regions) using
Paraclu (Frith et al., 2008). Tag per million (TPM) normalized read counts in
these clusters from the 136 RNA samples formed the expression data matrix
of interest. Tag clusters with an expression R0.5 TPM in at least 20% of the
samples were maintained, resulting in 30,331 tag clusters. ENSMBL genome
annotation (Kersey et al., 2014) was used to assign the tag clusters to a total
of 15,518 genes. All raw data are uploaded at https://export.uppmax.uu.se/
b2013047/CellReportsTables/.
Bioinformatic Analyses
Pathway and gene ontology analyses were performed using standard
webtools, including KEGG Mapper (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_
pathway1.html) and ToppFun (https://toppgene.cchmc.org).
Statistical Methods
Unless otherwise stated, values are means ± SD and compared by an unpaired
two-sided t test assuming unequal variances. One-sided tests were used in
qPCR validation experiments comparing ISO and IRO subjects. Nominal pa-
rameters were compared by chi-square test. Specific for CAGE data, the
PCA scores were tested using an unpaired t test assuming unequal variance.
Multiple regression and differential expression analyses for CAGE data were
performed using global linear models (GLMs) implemented in edgeR (Robin-
son et al., 2010), and significance was determined by Benjamini-Hochberg-
corrected FDR.
