The Bacillus cereus group comprises multiple species capable of causing emetic or
diarrheal foodborne illness. Despite being responsible for tens of thousands of illnesses
each year in the U.S. alone, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is not yet routinely
employed to characterize B. cereus group isolates from foodborne outbreaks. Here, we
describe the first WGS-based characterization of isolates linked to an outbreak caused
by members of the B. cereus group. In conjunction with a 2016 outbreak traced to a
supplier of refried beans served by a fast food restaurant chain in upstate New York, a
total of 33 B. cereus group isolates were obtained from human cases (n = 7) and food
samples (n = 26). Emetic (n = 30) and diarrheal (n = 3) isolates were most closely related
to B. paranthracis (group III) and B. cereus sensu stricto (group IV), respectively. WGS
indicated that the 30 emetic isolates (24 and 6 from food and humans, respectively)
were closely related and formed a well-supported clade distinct from publicly available
emetic group III genomes with an identical sequence type (ST 26). The 30 emetic group III
isolates from this outbreak differed from each other by a mean of 8.3 to 11.9 core single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while differing from publicly available emetic group III
ST 26 B. cereus group genomes by a mean of 301.7–528.0 core SNPs, depending on
the SNP calling methodology used. Using a WST-1 cell proliferation assay, the strains
isolated from this outbreak had only mild detrimental effects on HeLa cell metabolic
activity compared to reference diarrheal strain B. cereus ATCC 14579. We hypothesize
that the outbreak was a single source outbreak caused by emetic group III B. cereus
belonging to the B. paranthracis species, although food samples were not tested for
presence of the emetic toxin cereulide. In addition to showcasing how WGS can be used

potential microbiological and epidemiological challenges presented by B. cereus group
outbreaks, and we offer recommendations for analyzing WGS data from the isolates
associated with them.

INTRODUCTION
The Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) group, also known as B. cereus
sensu lato (s.l.) is a complex of closely related species that vary
in their ability to cause disease in humans. Foodborne illness
caused by members of the group primarily manifests itself in one
of two forms: (i) emetic intoxication that is caused by cereulide,
a heat-stable toxin produced by B. cereus within a food matrix
prior to consumption, or (ii) a diarrheal toxicoinfection, caused
by enterotoxins produced by bacteria in the small intestine of
the host (Ehling-Schulz et al., 2004; Schoeni and Wong, 2005;
Stenfors Arnesen et al., 2008). Here we refer to isolates that
carry ces genes encoding the cereulide biosynthetic pathway
as emetic isolates, and isolates that lack ces genes but carry
either hbl or cytK-2 genes that encode diarrheal enterotoxins
as diarrheal isolates. The gene variant cytK-2 was included in
this definition, as it was previously found in non-B. cytotoxicus
isolates associated with diarrheal illness (Castiaux et al., 2015;
Miller et al., 2018). The presence of nhe genes was not included
in our present definition of diarrheal isolates, due to the fact
that nhe genes are ubiquitously found in the majority of the B.
cereus group population (Carroll et al., 2017; Miller et al., 2018),
including all isolates in the present study, and their contribution
to diarrheal toxicoinfection is not yet fully understood (Doll et al.,
2013).
As foodborne pathogens, members of the B. cereus group are
estimated to cause 63,400 foodborne disease cases per year in the
U.S. (Scallan et al., 2011) and are confirmed or suspected to have
been responsible for 235 outbreaks reported in the U.S. between
1998 and 2008 (Bennett et al., 2013). Due in part to its typically
self-limiting nature, foodborne illness caused by members of
the B. cereus group is under-reported (Granum and Lund,
1997; Stenfors Arnesen et al., 2008), although severe infections
resulting in patient death have been reported (Naranjo et al.,
2011; Sanaei-Zadeh, 2012; Lotte et al., 2017). Furthermore, B.
cereus group isolates that have been linked to human clinical cases
of foodborne disease rarely undergo whole-genome sequencing
(WGS), as is becoming the norm for other foodborne pathogens
(Joensen et al., 2014; Ashton et al., 2015; Moura et al., 2017).
Here, we describe a foodborne outbreak caused by members
of the B. cereus group in which WGS was implemented to
characterize isolates from human clinical cases and food. To
our knowledge, this is the first description of a B. cereus
outbreak in which WGS was employed to characterize isolates. By
testing various combinations of variant calling methodologies, we
showcase how different bioinformatics pipelines can yield vastly
different results when pairwise SNP differences are the desired
metric for determining whether an isolate is part of an outbreak
or not. In addition to discussing the bioinformatic challenges, we
examine potential microbiological and epidemiological obstacles
that can hinder characterization of B. cereus group isolates from
suspected foodborne outbreaks, and we offer recommendations
to guide the characterization of future B. cereus group outbreaks
using WGS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection of Epidemiological Data
Epidemiological investigations were coordinated by the New
York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), and the outbreak
was reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). Investigation methods included (i) a cohort
study, (ii) food preparation review, (iii) an investigation at a
factory/production/treatment plant, (iv) food product traceback,
and (v) environment/food/water sample testing.
Isolation and Initial Characterization of B.
cereus Strains
Stool specimens were plated directly onto mannitol-egg yolk-
polymyxin (MYP) agar and incubated aerobically at 37◦C for
24 h. Food samples were diluted 1:10 in 1 X PBS, pH 7.4 in a
filter bag for homogenizer blenders and homogenized for 2 min.
One hundred µl of each homogenized sample were plated onto
MYP agar and incubated aerobically at 37◦C for 24 h. The MYP
agar plates for both the stool specimens and food samples were
observed after the 24 h incubation period. Individual B. cereus-
like colonies (i.e., pink colored and lecithinase positive) were
subcultured on trypticase soy agar (TSA) plates supplemented
with 5% sheep blood and incubated aerobically at 37◦C for
18–24 h. These isolates were identified as B. cereus using the
following conventional microbiological techniques: Gram stain,
colony morphology, hemolysis, motility, and spore stain. To
test for the presence of parasporal crystals often associated with
B. thuringiensis, isolates were cultured for 48 h at 37◦C on
sporulation agar slants. Smears were prepared, and slides were
heat fixed and then stained using malachite green and counter
stained with carbol fuchsin (Tallent et al., 2012b). Slides were then
observed for the presence or absence of parasporal crystals.
rpoB Allelic Typing
The 33 outbreak isolates were streaked onto brain heart
infusion (BHI) agar from their respective cryo stocks stored
at −80◦C and incubated overnight at 37◦C. Single isolated
colonies were inoculated in 5 ml BHI broth and incubated
overnight at 32◦C and used for genomic DNA extraction
using
Qiagen
DNeasy
blood
and
tissue
kits
(Qiagen).

 Carroll et al.
Bacillus Cereus Outbreak Genomic Sequencing
Extracted DNA was used as a template in a PCR reaction
using primers targeting a 750 bp sequence of the rpoB gene
(RzrpoBF:
AARYTIGGMCCTGAAGAAAT
and
RZrpoBR:
TGIARTTRTCATCAACCATGTG) (Ivy et al., 2012). PCR was
carried out in 25 µl reactions using GoTaq Green Master Mix
(Promega Corporation) under the following thermal cycling
conditions: 3 min at 94◦C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at
94◦C, 30 s at 55–45◦C (in the first 20 cycles the temperature
was reduced for 0.5◦C per cycle and then kept at 45◦C in the
following 20 cycles), followed by 1 min at 72◦C, and a final hold
at 4◦C. The resulting PCR product was used for genotyping
and preliminary species identification using the rpoB allele type
database available in Food Microbe Tracker (Ivy et al., 2012;
Vangay et al., 2013).
Bacterial Growth Conditions and
Collection of Bacterial Supernatants
The 33 outbreak isolates, as well as B. cereus s.s. type strain
ATCC 14579 and B. cereus emetic reference strain DSM 4312
(Food Microbe Tracker ID FSL M8-0547; Vangay et al., 2013)
were streaked onto BHI agar from their respective cryo stocks
stored at −80◦C. For immunoassays and cytotoxicity assays
(see sections Hemolysin BL and Non-hemolytic Enterotoxin
Detection and WST-1 Metabolic Activity Assay), cultures grown
from single isolated colonies for 18 h at 37◦C without shaking
were used for inoculation of fresh BHI broth. Fresh cultures were
grown to early stationary phase as determined by an OD600 of
∼1.5, which equals ∼108 CFU/ml. After incubation, growth was
quenched by placing cultures on ice. The cultures were then spun
down at 16,000 g for 2 min, and the supernatants were collected,
aliquoted in duplicate, and stored at −80◦C until further use in
cytotoxicity assays.
Hemolysin BL and Non-hemolytic
Enterotoxin Detection
Diarrheal strains grown as described above were used for
qualitative detection of hemolysin BL (Hbl) and non-hemolytic
enterotoxins (Nhe) with the Duopath Cereus Enterotoxins
immunoassay (Merck). Only select representatives of emetic
outbreak strains were tested (i.e., FSL R9-6381, FSL R9-6382,
FSL R9-6384, FSL R9-6389, FSL R9-6395, and FSL R9-6399), as
they did not carry genes encoding Hbl and were therefore not
expected to produce Hbl. Briefly, the temperatures of the cultures
and immunoassay kits were adjusted to room temperature. 150
µl of each isolate culture were added to the immunoassay port,
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The results were read
as positive if a red test line was visible after a 30-min incubation
at room temperature. Tests were considered valid only when
control lines were visible.
WST-1 Metabolic Activity Assay
HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a seeding density of
8 × 104 cells/cm2 (Fisichella et al., 2009) in Eagle’s minimum
essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and allowed to grow for 18–24 h at 37◦C, 5% CO2.
After incubation, the medium in each well was replaced with 100
µl of fresh medium containing 5% v/v of bacterial supernatants
(prepared as described in section Bacterial Growth Conditions
and Collection of Bacterial Supernatants) that were thawed and
pre-warmed to 37◦C. The combined medium and supernatants
were added to the cells using a multichannel pipettor to minimize
the variability in the duration of cell exposure to the toxin
amongst wells of a 96-well plate. Medium containing 5% BHI
was used as a negative control. Medium containing 5% v/v of
1% Triton X-100 dissolved in BHI (final concentration in the
test well was 0.05%) was used as a positive control expected
to significantly reduce the viability of HeLa cells. After 15 min
of intoxication at 37◦C, 5% CO2 (Miller et al., 2018), 10 µl
of WST-1 dye solution (Roche) was added to each well of the
plate, and the plate was incubated for 25 min at 37◦C, 5% CO2,
resulting in a total of 40 min exposure of cells to the supernatants.
After 30 s of orbital shaking at 600 rpm, the absorbances were
read by a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a precision mode at 450 and 690 nm,
the latter being subtracted from the former to account for the
background signal (i.e., corrected absorbances) (Fisichella et al.,
2009). Each test, including 0.05% Triton X-100, was conducted
with six technical replicates and on two different HeLa passages
using supernatants from single biological replicates, resulting in
a total of 12 technical replicates per isolate. The viability of cells
was determined by calculating a ratio of corrected absorbances
to that of BHI, converting to percentages, and calculating the
mean of the technical replicates for each isolate. The results were
compared to the results for cells treated with (i) 0.05% Triton X-
100, (ii) B. cereus s.s. type strain ATCC 14579 supernatant (i.e.,
reference for diarrheal strains), and (iii) B. cereus group strain
DSM 4312 supernatant (i.e., reference for emetic strains).
Statistical Analysis of Cytotoxicity Data
A Welch’s test and the Games-Howell post-hoc test that
are appropriate for analyses of data with non-homogeneous
variances were performed using results of all 12 technical
replicates of each outbreak-associated isolate, as well as the
reference strains and the positive control. For the Games-Howell
test, a Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple
comparisons. Statistical analyses were carried out in R version
3.4.3 (R Core Team., 2018).
Whole-Genome Sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from overnight cultures (∼18 h)
grown in BHI at 32◦C using Qiagen DNeasy blood and
tissue kits (Qiagen) or the Omega E.Z.N.A. Bacterial DNA
kit (Omega) following the manufacturers’ instructions. For the
E.Z.N.A. Bacterial DNA kit, the additional steps recommended
for difficult-to-lyse bacteria were taken to obtain sufficient DNA
yield. Briefly, one ml of an overnight culture was additionally
treated with glass beads provided in the E.Z.N.A. kit. DNA
was quantified using Qubit 3 and used for Nextera XT library
preparation (Illumina). Pooled libraries were sequenced in two
Illumina sequencing runs with either 2 × 250 or 2 × 300 bp
reads at the Penn State Genomics Core Facility and at the Cornell
Animal Health Diagnostic Center.

Bacillus Cereus Outbreak Genomic Sequencing
Initial Data Processing and Genome
Assembly
Illumina adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed using
Trimmomatic version 0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014) and the default
parameters for Nextera paired-end reads, and FastQC version
0.11.5
(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/
fastqc/) was used to confirm that read quality was adequate (e.g.,
no reads flagged as poor quality, no Illumina adapters present).
Genomes listed in Supplementary Table S1 were assembled de
novo using SPAdes version 3.11.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012), and
average per-base coverage was calculated using Samtools version
1.6 (Li et al., 2009) after mapping reads to their respective de novo
assemblies using BWA MEM version 0.7.13 (default parameters)
(Li and Durbin, 2010).
In silico Typing and Virulence Gene
Detection
BTyper version 2.2.0 (Carroll et al., 2017) was used to perform
in silico virulence gene detection, multi-locus sequence typing
(MLST), panC group assignment (as defined by Guinebretiere
et al., 2010), and rpoB allelic typing, as well as to extract
the gene sequences for all detected loci. For virulence gene
detection, the default settings were used (i.e., 50% amino acid
sequence identity, 70% query coverage), as these cut-offs have
been shown to correlate with PCR-based detection of virulence
genes in B. cereus group isolates (Kovac et al., 2016; Carroll et al.,
2017). BMiner version 2.0.2 (Carroll et al., 2017) was used to
aggregate the output files from BTyper and create a virulence
gene presence/absence matrix.
Construction of k-mer Based Phylogeny
Using Outbreak Strains and Genomes of 18
B. cereus Group Species
kSNP version 3.1 (Gardner and Hall, 2013; Gardner et al.,
2015) was used to produce a set of core SNPs among the
33 outbreak genomes, plus a type strain or RefSeq reference
genome assembly from each of the 18 B. cereus group species
listed in Supplementary Table S2 (Stenfors Arnesen et al., 2008;
Guinebretière et al., 2013; Jiménez et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2016;
Liu et al., 2017), using the optimal k-mer size as determined
by Kchooser (k = 21). The resulting core SNPs were used
in conjunction with RAxML version 8.2.11 (Stamatakis, 2014)
to construct a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny using the
GTRCAT model with a Lewis ascertainment bias correction
(Lewis, 2001) to account for the use of solely variant sites, and
500 bootstrap replicates. The resulting phylogenetic tree was
formatted using the phylobase (Hackathon et al., 2017), ggtree
(Guangchuang et al., 2017), phytools (Revell, 2012), and ape
(Paradis et al., 2004) packages in R version 3.4.3.
Variant Calling and Phylogeny
Construction Using Outbreak Isolates
Combinations of five reference-based variant calling pipelines
(Table 1) and reference genomes (Table 2), as well as one
reference-free SNP calling pipeline (Table 1), were used to
separately identify core and total SNPs among (i) all 33 outbreak-
related isolates (30 emetic group III isolates and three group IV
isolates) and (ii) the subset of 30 emetic group III isolates. For the
subset of 30 emetic group III isolates, all reference-based variant
calling pipelines described below were additionally run with
dustmasked versions of the reference genomes listed in Table 2,
in which DustMasker version 1.0.0 (part of BLAST version 2.6.0)
(Morgulis et al., 2006) was used to mask low-complexity portions
(i.e., intervals with highly biased nucleotide distributions which
can bias sequence similarity searches) in each reference genome
(Ye et al., 2006).
For the Samtools and Freebayes pipelines (Table 1), trimmed
Illumina paired-end reads from the queried isolates were
mapped to the appropriate reference genome using BWA mem
version 0.7.13 (Li, 2013) and either Samtools/Bcftools version
1.6 (Li et al., 2009) or Freebayes version 1.1.0 (Garrison and
Marth, 2012), respectively, were used to call variants. Vcftools
version 0.1.14 (Danecek et al., 2011) was used to remove
indels and SNPs with a SNP quality score <20, as well as
to construct consensus sequences. For both variant calling
pipelines, Gubbins version 2.2.0 (Croucher et al., 2015) was
used to remove recombination events from the consensus
sequences, and the Neighbor Similarity Score (NSS) (Jakobsen
and Easteal, 1996), Maximum Chi-Squared (Smith, 1992), and
Pairwise Homoplasy Index (PHI) (Bruen et al., 2006) tests
implemented in PhiPack version 1.0 (Bruen et al., 2006) were
used to assess whether recombination and homoplasies were
present in sequence alignments before and after recombination
was removed, using 1,000 permutations each and a window
size of 100 (Supplementary Table S3). Both of these pipelines
are publicly available and can be reproduced in their entirety
(SNPBac version 1.0.0; https://github.com/lmc297/SNPBac).
For the CFSAN (Davis et al., 2015) and LYVE-SET (Katz et al.,
2017) pipelines (versions 1.0.1 and 1.1.4 g, respectively; Table 1),
trimmed Illumina paired-end reads were used as input, and all
default pipeline steps were run as outlined in the manuals. For
the Parsnp pipeline (Treangen et al., 2014) (Table 1), assembled
genomes of the outbreak isolates were used as input, and
Parsnp’s implementation of PhiPack (Bruen et al., 2006) was
used to filter out recombination events. For kSNP3 (Table 1),
assembled genomes of the outbreak isolates were used as input,
and Kchooser was used to determine the optimum k-mer size for
the full 33-isolate data set and the 30 emetic group III isolate set
(k = 21 and 23, respectively).
For all variant calling and filtering pipelines, RAxML version
8.2.10 was used to construct ML phylogenies using the resulting
SNPs under the GTRGAMMA model with a Lewis ascertainment
bias correction and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Phylogenetic trees
were annotated using FigTree version 1.4.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.
uk/software/figtree/).

to query all 2,156 B. cereus group genome assemblies available
in NCBI’s RefSeq database (downloaded March 2018) (Pruitt
et al., 2007) and identify all genome assemblies that (i) belonged
to group III based on panC sequence, (ii) belonged to ST 26
based on in silico MLST, and (iii) were found to possess the ces
operon in its entirety (cesABCD) at the default coverage and
identity thresholds. This search produced 25 genome assemblies
in addition to the 30 emetic group III genomes sequenced here.
Only three of the 25 RefSeq genome assemblies had Sequence
Read Archive (SRA) data linked to their BioSample accession
numbers, making short read data readily available only for these
three isolates. Consequently, only Parsnp version 1.2 and kSNP
version 3.1 were used to identify SNPs in all 55 group III emetic
genomes (25 from NCBI RefSeq and 30 sequenced here), as these
approaches can be used with assembled genomes and do not
require short reads as input. For Parsnp, the chromosome of
B. cereus AH187 was used as a reference genome. For kSNP3,
Kchooser was used to select the optimal k-mer size (k = 21),
and the chromosome of B. cereus AH187 was included for k-mer
based SNP calling.
RAxML version 8.2.10 was used to construct ML phylogenies
using the resulting core SNPs for each of the Parsnp and kSNP3

pipelines under the GTRCAT model with a Lewis ascertainment
bias correction and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Pairwise core
SNP differences between all 55 isolates were obtained using
the dist.gene function in R’s ape package. The permutest and
betadisper functions in R’s vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2018)
were used to conduct an ANOVA-like permutation test to test
if publicly available genomes were more variable than isolates
from this outbreak based on pairwise core SNP differences
and 5 independent trials using 100,000 permutations each.
Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM; Clarke, 1993) using the anosim
function in the vegan package in R was used to determine if
the average of the ranks of within-group distances was greater
than or equal to the average of the ranks of between-group
distances (Anderson and Walsh, 2013), where groups were
defined as (i) the 30 emetic isolates from this outbreak, and
(ii) the 25 external emetic ST 26 isolates (downloaded from
RefSeq). ANOSIM tests were conducted using pairwise core SNP
differences and five independent runs of 10,000 permutations
each. For both the ANOVA-like permutation tests and the
ANOSIM tests, Bonferroni corrections were used to correct for
multiple comparisons at the α = 0.05 level.
Statistical Comparison of Phylogenetic
Trees
The Kendall-Colijn (Kendall and Colijn, 2015) test described by
Katz et al. (2017) was used to compare the topologies of trees,
using the treespace (Jombart et al., 2017), ips (Heibl, 2008),
phangorn (Schliep, 2011), docopt (de Jonge, 2016), and stringr
(Wickham, 2018) packages in R version 3.4.3. The phylogenies
that underwent pairwise testing were constructed using (i) either
core or total SNPs identified in 30 emetic group III genomes via
all six SNP calling pipelines (Table 1), using either an unmasked
or dustmasked closed reference genome (B. cereus AH187;
Table 2), and (ii) SNPs identified in 55 emetic ST 26 genomes (25
publicly available genomes and the 30 emetic isolates sequenced
here) using the kSNP3 (core and total SNPs) and Parsnp (core
SNPs, as Parsnp queries the core genome by definition) pipelines.
For all pairwise tree comparisons, a lambda value of 0 (to give
weight to tree topology rather than branch lengths; Katz et al.,
2017) was used along with 100,000 random trees as a background
distribution, and a Bonferroni correction was used to correct
for multiple comparisons. Pairs of trees were considered to be
more topologically similar than would be expected by chance
if a significant P-value (P < 0.05) resulted after correcting for
multiple testing (Katz et al., 2017).
Calculation of Average Nucleotide Identity
Values
FastANI version 1.0 (Jain et al., 2018) was used to calculate
average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between assembled
genomes of isolates sequenced in this study and selected reference
genomes (Table 2), as well as the genomes of 18 currently
published B. cereus group species (Supplementary Table S2).
Availability of Data
Trimmed Illumina reads for all 33 isolates sequenced in this study
have been made publicly available (NCBI BioProject Accession
PRJNA437714), with NCBI BioSample and SRA accession
numbers for all isolates listed in Supplementary Table S1. All
figures have been deposited in FigShare (DOI https://doi.org/
10.6084/m9.figshare.7001525.v1), and records of all isolates are
available in Food Microbe Tracker (Vangay et al., 2013).
RESULTS
Both Emetic and Diarrheal Symptoms
Were Reported Among Cases Associated
With the B. cereus Foodborne Outbreak
Between September 30th and October 6th, 2016, local health
departments in upstate New York’s Niagara and Erie counties
reported a total of 179 estimated foodborne illness cases among
customers of a Mexican fast-food restaurant chain in eight
towns/cities. Among these cases, laboratory results were available
for ten cases. For seven of these cases, B. cereus group species
were isolated from patient stool samples. While no deaths,
hospitalizations, or emergency room visits were reported from
169 cases from which information was obtained, 4 resulted in a
visit to a health care provider (not including emergency room
visits). More than 2/3 of 179 cases were female (69%), and 61%
of cases fell within the 20–74 age group. In 156 of 179 total cases
(87%), refried beans had been consumed.
Of 169 cases from which information was obtained, 88%
reported vomiting, and more than half reported nausea and
abdominal cramps (95 and 65%, respectively). However, in
addition to vomiting, 38% of cases also reported diarrhea.
Additional symptoms reported included (i) weakness (43%),
(ii) chills (40%), (iii) dehydration (35%), (iv) headache (28%),
(v) myalgia (muscle ache/pain; 16%), (vi) fever (16%), (vii)
sweating (16%), and (viii) sore throat (3%). The incubation
period observed for all cases ranged from 0.25 to 24 h, with a
median of 2 h. The duration of illness ranged from 0.25 to 144 h,
with a median estimate of 6 h.
A
traceback
was
conducted,
with
the
source
of
the
outbreak determined to be a processing plant in Pennsylvania.
The distributor in Pennsylvania packaged the refried beans
specifically for the chain establishment where the outbreak
occurred. The establishments where the outbreak occurred
received 5 lb trays of pre-cooked, sealed, and frozen refried beans
from the production/packaging facility. The refried beans would
undergo cooking and a hot hold prior to consumption at the
establishments where the outbreak occurred. It was determined
that the refried beans were contaminated prior to preparation at
the chain establishment.
Stool samples from suspect cases were cultured on MYP
agar and B. cereus-like colonies were isolated from seven stool
samples. Additionally, B. cereus-like colonies were isolated from
nine food samples that were collected from five restaurants. In
total, seven isolates from stool samples and 26 isolates from foods
were confirmed to belong to the B. cereus group using standard
microbiological methods. Isolates that were large Gram-positive
rods, beta-hemolytic, and motile were presumptively identified
as B. cereus-like. Additionally, spore staining was performed to
test for the presence of parasporal crystals associated with B.

thuringiensis, for which all isolates were negative. All 33 B. cereus
group isolates underwent preliminary molecular characterization
by Sanger sequencing of rpoB, which revealed two distinct allelic
types belonging to phylogenetic groups III (rpoB allelic type AT
125) and IV (AT 92).
WGS Confirms Presence of Multiple B.
cereus Group Species Represented Among
Outbreak Strains
rpoB allelic types (ATs) assigned in silico were identical to
those obtained using Sanger sequencing for all 33 isolates
(Table 3). panC group assignment confirmed the presence
of B. cereus s.l. isolates from multiple phylogenetic groups
(Table 3), with panC group III (n = 30) and panC group IV
(n = 3) represented among the 33 isolates. In silico MLST
further resolved the group IV isolates into two sequence
types (STs): the two strains isolated from refried beans served
at two different restaurants had identical STs, while the
single human isolate belonging to group IV had a unique
ST (Table 3). All 30 panC group III isolates belonged to
ST 26, including the remaining six human clinical isolates
(Table 3).
The presence of isolates from multiple B. cereus s.l.
phylogenetic groups, as suggested by the rpoB, panC, and
MLST loci among isolates sequenced in conjunction with this
outbreak, was confirmed using core SNPs detected in all outbreak
isolates, as well as the genomes of 18 currently recognized
B. cereus group species (Figure 1). The three isolates assigned
to panC group IV using a 7-group scheme (Guinebretière
et al., 2008) were most closely related to the B. cereus s.s.
type strain (Figure 1). All three group IV B. cereus isolates
possessed diarrheal toxin genes hblABCD and cytK-2 at high
identity and coverage (Figure 1), which code for enterotoxins
hemolysin BL (Hbl) and cytotoxin K variant 2 (CytK-2),
respectively. The 30 isolates assigned to panC group III,
however, were most closely related to the type strain of B.
paranthracis (Figure 1). Unlike the B. paranthracis type strain,
all of the group III isolates investigated here were motile and
possessed the cesABCD operon (Figure 1), which codes for
emetic toxin-producing cereulide synthetase. In the case of isolate
HUMN_10_18_16_FECAL_NA_R9-6384, cesD was split onto
two contigs.
Based on average nucleotide identity (ANI) values, the three
diarrheal group IV isolates were classified as B. cereus s.s.
(ANI > 95; Table 3). The 30 emetic group III isolates from this
outbreak, however, most closely resembled the type strain of
B. paranthracis (ANI > 95; Table 3), indicating that the emetic
group III and diarrheal group IV isolates from this outbreak are
different B. cereus group species.
Emetic and Diarrheal B. cereus Isolates
Associated With the Foodborne Outbreak
do Not Differ in Cytotoxicity
All three diarrheal strains isolated in conjunction with the
outbreak (FSL R9-6406, FSL R9-6410, and FSL R9-6413) were
found to produce Hbl, as well as non-hemolytic enterotoxin
(Nhe). Characterization of six representatives of the emetic
isolates tested (i.e., FSL R9-6381, FSL R9-6382, FSL R9-6384,
FSL R9-6389, FSL R9-6395, and FSL R9-6399) revealed that
they produced Nhe, but not Hbl. The supernatant of diarrheal
B. cereus s.s. ATCC 14579 showed a stronger inhibitory effect
on the viability of HeLa cells compared to supernatants of
the 33 outbreak-associated isolates (Games-Howell P < 0.05;
Figure 2). Furthermore, the viability of HeLa cells treated with
0.05% Triton X-100, the positive control, was significantly
lower compared to viability of HeLa cells treated with bacterial
supernatants (Games-Howell P < 0.05; Figure 2). Among all
pairs of emetic isolates, only the viabilities of HeLa cells exposed
to the supernatants of isolates FSL R9-6409 and FSL R9-
6387 were found to differ (Games-Howell P < 0.05; Figure 2).
The differences in HeLa cell viability after treatment with
supernatants of these two emetic outbreak-associated strains are
likely due to biological variability among replicates, as outbreak-
associated emetic isolates were shown to be clonal (Figure 1).
Taken together, the emetic group (represented by 30 emetic
outbreak-associated isolates) had a mean cell viability of 97.5 ±
5.1%, while the diarrheal group (represented by three diarrheal
outbreak-associated isolates) gave a mean cell viability of 101.4
± 7.9%, as compared to the HeLa cells treated with BHI (i.e.,
negative control).
Core SNPs Identified Among B. cereus
Group Outbreak Isolates From Two
Phylogenetic Groups Are Dependent on
Variant Calling Pipeline and Reference
Genome Selection
To simulate a scenario in which genomes from a B. cereus
outbreak spanning multiple phylogenetic groups were analyzed
in aggregate, core SNPs were identified in all 33 outbreak
isolates from groups III and IV (n = 30 and three isolates,
respectively) using (i) combinations of five reference-based
variant calling pipelines (Table 1) and three different reference
genomes (Table 2) and (ii) a reference-free SNP calling method
(Table 1). When genomes from all 33 isolates were analyzed
together, the number of core SNPs identified by each pipeline
and reference combination varied by up to several orders
of magnitude (Figure 3), often with little agreement between
pipelines in terms of the core SNPs they reported (Figure 4).
Independent of reference genome, the CFSAN pipeline was the
most conservative, consistently identifying the fewest number of
core SNPs when all 33 isolates were queried in aggregate (50,
27, and 0 core SNPs using reference genomes from groups III,
IV, and VII, respectively) (Figure 3). This can be contrasted with
the Samtools, Freebayes, and Parsnp pipelines, which produced
upwards of 100,000 core SNPs when the selected reference
genome was a member of one of the groups being queried
in the outbreak isolate set (group III and IV; Figure 3). In
cases where a distant genome was used as the reference (group
VII B. cytotoxicus type strain chromosome), all reference-based
pipelines reported fewer core SNPs than kSNP3’s reference-free
k-mer based SNP calling approach (Figure 3).

Choice of Variant Calling Pipeline Has
Greater Influence on Core SNP
Identification Than Choice of Closely
Related Closed or Draft Reference
Genome for Emetic Group III B. cereus
Group Isolates
The 30 emetic group III isolates were queried in the absence of
their group IV counterparts using combinations of five reference-
based variant calling pipelines (Table 1) and two reference
genomes (the closed chromosome of B. cereus AH187, with and
without dustmasking, and contigs of one of the isolates identified
in this outbreak, with and without dustmasking; Table 2) and
one reference-free SNP calling method (Table 1). In this scenario,
the choice of variant calling pipeline had a greater effect on
the number of core SNPs obtained than the choice of reference
genome, as both reference genomes possessed the same virulence
gene profile (virulotype), rpoB AT, panC group, MLST sequence
type, and were of the same species (B. paranthracis; ANI > 95%)
as the 30 emetic isolates (Figure 5A). Congruent with this, the
number of pairwise core SNP differences between emetic isolates
sequenced in this outbreak varied more with the selection of

variant calling pipeline than with reference genome (Figure 6A).
When the unmasked closed chromosome of B. cereus AH187
was used as a reference, pairwise core SNP differences among
emetic isolates from this outbreak ranged from 0 to 8 (mean of
2.9; CFSAN), 7 to 29 (mean of 16.1; Freebayes), 0 to 8 (mean
of 2.8; LYVE-SET), 0 to 64 (mean of 23.6; Parsnp), and 1 to 16
SNPs (mean of 8.2; Samtools) (Figure 5A). Using the reference-
free kSNP3 pipeline, this range was 1–46 SNPs (mean of 16.7;
Figure 5A). The CFSAN and LYVE-SET pipelines produced
nearly identical results in terms of the number and identity of the
core SNPs called (23 and 22 SNPs, respectively, 20 of which were
detected by both pipelines; Figure 7), as well as the topologies of
the phylogenies those SNPs produced: all CFSAN and LYVE-SET
phylogenies were more similar to each other than what would
be expected by chance (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S4).
Additionally, the two methods that relied on assembled genomes
rather than short reads for SNP calling (kSNP3 and Parsnp)
produced the greatest numbers of core SNPs (Figure 5A).
Within the emetic group III isolates associated with this

(Figure 7). Out of these 32 SNPs, 23 were identified in
protein coding genes, 14 of which produced non-synonymous
amino acid changes (Supplementary Table S5). Genes with
non-synonymous changes were involved in molybdopterin

In addition to detecting core SNPs in the genomes of the 30
emetic group III isolates, total (core and accessory) SNPs were
detected in the 30 emetic group III genomes using combinations
of four reference-based variant calling pipelines (Parsnp, which
only reports core SNPs, was excluded; Table 1) and two reference
genomes (the closed chromosome of B. cereus AH187 and
contigs of one of the isolates identified in this outbreak,
with and without dustmasking; Table 2) and one reference-
free SNP calling method (Table 1). When total SNPs were
accounted for, rather than solely core SNPs, all pipeline/reference
genome combinations showed increases in the number of SNPs
detected and the range of pairwise SNP differences between
genomes (Figures 5B, 6B). Whether the addition of accessory
SNPs translated into a significant difference in phylogenetic
topology, however, depended on the variant calling pipeline
used. When the B. cereus AH187 closed chromosome was used
as a reference, SNPs detected using the LYVE-SET pipeline
produced phylogenies considered to be more topologically
similar than would be expected by chance (Kendall-Colijn test

with ST 26 were downloaded from NCBI. This produced a total
of 55 emetic group III isolates with ST 26 (30 isolates from this
outbreak and 25 from NCBI RefSeq). Among the 55 emetic ST
26 genomes, Parsnp identified almost twice as many core SNPs
as kSNP3 (4,597 and 2,593 core SNPs, respectively). However,
the topologies of phylogenies produced using the core SNPs
identified by each pipeline were found to be more similar than
would be expected by chance (Kendall-Colijn test P < 0.05;
Figure 8).
Based on pairwise core SNP differences, the publicly available
genomes showed greater variability than the outbreak isolates
described here, regardless of whether kSNP3 or Parsnp was used
for variant calling (ANOVA-like permutation test P < 0.05;
Supplementary Figure S1). Pairwise core SNP differences of the
30 emetic group III isolates from this outbreak ranged from 0
to 25 SNPs (mean of 8.3) and 0 to 44 SNPs (mean of 11.9)
when the kSNP3 and Parsnp pipelines were used, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S1). For external ST 26 isolates not
associated with this outbreak, pairwise core SNP differences
ranged from 0 to 1,474 SNPs (mean of 425.7) and 0 to 3,111 SNPs
(mean of 828.3) when kSNP3 and Parsnp were used, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S1). Between these two groups (the 30
emetic isolates from this outbreak and the 25 external emetic
ST 26 isolates), pairwise core SNP differences ranged from 73
to 1,258 SNPs (mean of 301.7; kSNP3) and 74 to 2,709 SNPs
(mean of 528.0; Parsnp) (Supplementary Figure S1). Reflecting
this, the average of the ranks of pairwise SNP distances within
emetic isolates from this outbreak was less than the average of
the ranks of pairwise SNP distances between the emetic isolates
from this outbreak and the external ST 26 isolates (ANOSIM
P < 0.05). This is likely a result of the differences in variance
between the outbreak and external ST 26 isolates, as supported by
the results of the ANOVA-like permutation test (Anderson and
Walsh, 2013).
DISCUSSION
While B. cereus causes a considerable number of foodborne
illness cases annually, outbreaks are rarely investigated with the
methodological rigor (e.g., use of WGS) that is increasingly
used for surveillance and outbreak investigations targeting other
foodborne pathogens. A specific challenge in the U.S. is that,
unlike for some other diseases, disease cases caused by B. cereus
are typically not reportable, even though foodborne illnesses,
regardless of etiology, are reportable in some states, including
NY. This, combined with the typically mild course of B. cereus
infection, means that human B. cereus isolates are rarely available
for WGS. Furthermore, even if clinical B. cereus group isolates
are available, WGS may not be used for isolate characterization
in cases where infections are mild. Due to the availability of
B. cereus isolates for seven human cases, the outbreak reported
here presented a unique opportunity to pilot the use of WGS
for investigation of B. cereus outbreaks. The data and approaches
presented here will not only facilitate future investigation of other
B. cereus outbreaks but will also help with application of WGS for
investigation of other foodborne disease outbreaks where limited
reference WGS data and information on genomic diversity are
available.
Addressing the Microbiological and
Epidemiological Challenges Associated
With Determining the Causative Agent of
an Emetic Foodborne Outbreak
The agar MYP used for isolation of strains from food and
human clinical samples in the outbreak reported here is one
of the two selective differential agars recommended in the
FDA BAM protocol for the isolation of B. cereus group strains
(Tallent et al., 2012b). The second recommended agar, Bacara,
has been shown to be more selective and more effective in
suppressing the growth of other Gram-positive microorganisms
that may be present in tested samples (e.g., other Bacillus species,
Listeria, Staphylococcus) (Tallent et al., 2012a; Kabir et al., 2017).
Since Bacara medium has a proprietary formula and cannot be
purchased in a dehydrated powder form (Tallent et al., 2012b),
it is less likely to be readily available for use in labs that do
not routinely test for B. cereus group species. Use of both
types of media may increase the success of B. cereus group
isolation from food and clinical samples, especially isolation of
emetic strains (Ehling-Schulz et al., 2005; Ceuppens et al., 2013).
Furthermore, the isolation of B. cereus group strains associated
with this outbreak was carried out at 37◦C, which is higher
than the temperature of 30◦C that is recommended by the
FDA BAM (Tallent et al., 2012b). Nevertheless, while incubation
at this temperature may inhibit the growth of psychrotolerant
species of the B. cereus group (e.g., B. weihenstephanensis), it is
not expected to interfere with the isolation of B. cereus group
strains that are able to grow at human body temperature and
cause toxicoinfection. It is also not expected to compromise
isolation of emetic isolates with the capacity to cause intoxication,
as emetic strains have been previously found primarily in
phylogenetic group III, which does not contain psychrotolerant
strains (Carroll et al., 2017). Overall, use of both types of isolation
media and a moderate incubation temperature of 30◦C may
minimize the isolation bias.
While the isolation of B. cereus group strains from food
and clinical samples is essential for linking them to a potential
foodborne outbreak, further information is needed to definitively
prove that an outbreak was caused by B. cereus. Emetic disease
caused by members of the B. cereus group can be attributed to the
production of the highly heat- and pH-resistant toxin cereulide
in food prior to ingestion (Ehling-Schulz et al., 2004, 2015;
Stenfors Arnesen et al., 2008). Because cereulide is produced
within the food matrix itself, prior to consumption, the mere
presence of emetic B. cereus group strains in food or human
clinical samples cannot definitively prove that an outbreak was
caused by a member of the B. cereus group; rather, the presence
of cereulide itself is essential for linking food and clinical samples
to an outbreak with high confidence (Andersson et al., 2004;
Stenfors Arnesen et al., 2008). For this outbreak, the presence
of cereulide in food and human clinical samples linked to the
outbreak was not assessed, as testing for cereulide is not currently
included in the BAM protocol as a routine method for the

detection and enumeration of B. cereus in food. Ergo, there is
no definitive proof that the outbreak was caused by cereulide-
producing emetic group III B. cereus and not a similar foodborne
pathogen (e.g., enterotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus,
which manifest in similar symptoms to those associated with
cereulide) (Messelhäusser et al., 2014). However, due to the
presence of highly clonal, ces-positive group III ST 26 B. cereus
group isolates among food and clinical samples linked to the
outbreak, as well as epidemiological data that support this, the
emetic strain is the most probable causative agent. While it is not
currently included in the BAM protocol for B. cereus isolation
(Tallent et al., 2012b), testing for the presence of cereulide in
food and clinical samples linked to potential outbreaks caused by
emetic B. cereus can aid in providing a definitive link between
illness and causative agent.
Considerations for Addressing the Unique
Challenges Associated With
Characterization of Foodborne Outbreaks
Linked to the B. cereus Group Using WGS
In B. cereus outbreaks, interpretation of WGS data can be
challenging, especially in cases where strains of multiple closely
related species or subtypes appear to be associated with an
outbreak. B. cereus outbreaks—particularly emetic outbreaks
caused by cereulide-producing B. cereus group isolates—are often
associated with improper handling of food (e.g., temperature
abuse) (Ehling-Schulz et al., 2004; Stenfors Arnesen et al., 2008).
This, and their ubiquitous presence in the environment, make it
important to consider the possibility of a multi-strain or multi-
species outbreak in addition to a single-source outbreak caused
by a single strain. In the outbreak characterized here, B. cereus
group strains from two phylogenetic groups, III and IV, were
isolated from both human clinical stool samples, as well as refried
beans linked to the outbreak. The separation of outbreak-related
isolates into three diarrheal group IV isolates (representing two
distinct STs) and 30 emetic isolates may be explained by one of the
following scenarios: (i) the outbreak was caused by refried beans
contaminated with multiple B. cereus group species (isolates from
groups III and IV), both of which caused illness in humans, (ii)
in addition to housing emetic outbreak strains that belonged to
group III, samples of refried beans and patient stool samples
harbored group IV B. cereus s.l. isolates that were not part of
the outbreak but were incidentally isolated from stool and food
samples, or (iii) a subset of patient stool samples and food
samples did not harbor B. cereus s.l. group III isolates belonging
to the outbreak, but did harbor group IV strains that were isolated
and sequenced. In order to determine which of these scenarios
explains the presence of multiple B. cereus group species among
isolates sequenced in conjunction with a foodborne outbreak,
additional epidemiological and microbiological data are needed.
Valuable metrics for inclusion/exclusion of B. cereus group
cases in a foodborne outbreak include patient exposure, patient
symptoms (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, onset and duration of
illness), levels of B. cereus present in implicated food and patient
samples (CFU/g or CFU/ml), cytotoxicity of isolates, and the
approach used to select bacterial colonies to undergo WGS
(Glasset et al., 2016). However, some of these data may be more
valuable than others. In their characterization of 564 B. cereus
group strains associated with 140 strong-evidence foodborne
outbreaks in France between 2007 and 2014, Glasset et al. (2016)
found that patient symptoms could not be associated with the
presence of emetic and diarrheal strains. More than half (57%)
of the B. cereus outbreaks queried in their study included patients
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org

exhibiting both emetic and diarrheal symptoms. Similar results
were observed here, as emetic and diarrheal symptoms were
reported in 88 and 38% of cases, respectively, with both vomiting
and diarrhea reported by multiple patients. All emetic isolates
associated with this outbreak carried nhe genes and also produced
Nhe enterotoxin, as determined using the immunoassay. While
it has been proposed that a combination of emetic and diarrheal
symptoms may be due to the fact that emetic group III isolates
have been shown to produce diarrheal enterotoxin Nhe at
high levels (Glasset et al., 2016), incongruences between isolate
virulotype and patient symptoms may still exist. Importantly, this
indicates the need for further investigation of factors affecting
the expression of B. cereus group virulence genes, as well as their
potential synergistic activities (Doll et al., 2013).
Another metric that can be used for determining whether
B. cereus group isolates are part of an outbreak or not is the
level of B. cereus present in the implicated food. Like patient
symptoms, B. cereus counts from implicated foods may aid in
an outbreak investigation, but likely cannot definitively prove
whether an isolate is part of an outbreak or not. For example,
outbreaks caused by implicated foods with B. cereus counts of
<103 CFU/g and as low as 400 CFU/g for diarrheal and emetic
diseases, respectively, have been described (Glasset et al., 2016),
despite levels of at least 105 CFU/g often being detected in
implicated foods (Stenfors Arnesen et al., 2008). The levels of
B. cereus present in refried beans in the outbreak described here
were not determined. However, like patient symptoms, B. cereus
count data may be a useful supplemental metric for investigating
B. cereus group outbreaks in the future.
In addition to patient symptoms and pathogen load in the
food, incubation period can be used to determine whether an
isolate is part of an outbreak or not, as it is significantly shorter for
emetic strains than diarrheal strains (Ehling-Schulz et al., 2004;
Stenfors Arnesen et al., 2008; Glasset et al., 2016). In the outbreak
described here, the patient from which a non-emetic group IV
B. cereus group strain was isolated reported an incubation time
of 1 h, the lowest incubation time of all seven confirmed human
clinical cases. However, this is still within the observed range of
incubation times for emetic B. cereus disease (0.5–6 h) (Stenfors
Arnesen et al., 2008). Although no emetic group III B. cereus s.l.
strain was isolated from the clinical sample, it is possible that the
patient could have been intoxicated with cereulide produced in
the food by the emetic B. cereus strain that caused the outbreak.
However, it is also possible that a pathogen which causes similar
symptoms to foodborne illness caused by emetic B. cereus was
responsible for the patient’s illness (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus).
Lastly,

to
include/exclude outbreak-associated B. cereus group isolates.
In the outbreak described here, the patient from which a non-
emetic group IV B. cereus group strain was isolated reported
vomiting and nausea and no diarrheal symptoms, despite the
clinical isolate’s possession of multiple diarrheal toxin genes
and no emetic toxin genes. This could suggest that the patient
was intoxicated with the cereulide, but the isolate itself did not
survive the passage through the patient’s gastrointestinal tract,
or that it survived in a low concentration that resulted in failure
of isolation on MYP. It is also possible that our understanding
of the specific virulence genes responsible for different B.
cereus-associated disease symptoms is still incomplete and that
the diarrheal isolate obtained from the clinical sample was in fact
responsible for symptoms of vomiting and nausea. To further
investigate this, we carried out immunoassay-based detection of
Hbl and Nhe enterotoxins, as well as a WST-1 proliferation assay
with HeLa cells exposed to bacterial supernatants presumably
containing toxins. The results of Hbl and Nhe immunodetection
and cytotoxicity revealed that diarrheal isolates only had mild
detrimental effects on HeLa cell viability, despite the fact
that they produced both hemolysin BL and non-hemolytic
enterotoxins. This can be contrasted with the B. cereus s.s. type
strain, which substantially reduced the viability of the HeLa cells.
For the outbreak described here, results obtained using
a
combination
of
microbiological,
epidemiological,
and
bioinformatic methods indicate that hypothesis (i), in which
the diarrheal strains were part of a multi-species outbreak, can
likely be excluded. Evidence supporting the conclusion that the
human clinical diarrheal isolate was not part of the outbreak
described here include: (i) the emetic symptoms reported by the
patient were incongruent with the virulotype of the isolate, (ii)
the incubation time was typical for intoxication, (iii) the human
clinical diarrheal isolate had a different MLST ST compared to
all other isolates sequenced in this outbreak, and (iv) the human
diarrheal isolate did not exhibit substantial cytotoxicity against
HeLa cells (Figure 2). This may be due to the fact that this case
was not part of the outbreak and was due to an infection or
intoxication caused by another pathogen that leads to disease
symptoms similar to B. cereus (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus), or
that a group IV B. cereus strain was isolated and sequenced in lieu
of the group III emetic outbreak isolate. There is limited evidence
as to whether humans can be asymptomatic carriers of group IV
B. cereus (Ghosh, 1978; Turnbull and Kramer, 1985), making it
likely that isolation and sequencing of a group IV B. cereus strain
could be due to the use of MYP agar as the sole selective agar,
which has been shown to hinder detection of emetic B. cereus
group isolates (Ehling-Schulz et al., 2005; Ceuppens et al., 2013).
In future outbreaks, the use of additional selective media (e.g.,
Bacara agar), enrichment media, and isolation temperatures may
aid in isolation of the causative B. cereus group strain.
While we have shown here that WGS data can be
a valuable tool for characterizing B. cereus group isolates
from a foodborne outbreak, our results also showcase the
importance of supplementing WGS data with epidemiological
and microbiological metadata to draw meaningful conclusions
from B. cereus group genomic data. Furthermore, the availability
of WGS and cytotoxicity data from a larger set of B. cereus isolates
from symptomatic patients may also provide an opportunity
to use comparative genomics approaches to further explore
virulence genes that are linked to different disease outcomes in
the future.

rightfully so, as it offers the ability to characterize foodborne
pathogens at unprecedented resolution, and it has been able to
improve outbreak and cluster detection for numerous foodborne
pathogens (Allard et al., 2017; Kovac et al., 2017; Moran-
Gilad, 2017; Taboada et al., 2017), including Salmonella enterica
(Taylor et al., 2015; Hoffmann et al., 2016; Gymoese et al.,
2017), Escherichia coli (Grad et al., 2012; Holmes et al., 2015;
Rusconi et al., 2016), and Listeria monocytogenes (Jackson
et al., 2016; Kwong et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017a,b; Moura
et al., 2017). However, as demonstrated here and elsewhere,
variant calling pipelines and the various mapping/alignment,
SNP calling, and SNP filtering practices that they employ (e.g.,
removal of recombination and clustered SNPs) can influence
the identification of SNPs in WGS data and, thus, the topology
of a resulting phylogeny (Pightling et al., 2014, 2015; Croucher
et al., 2015; Hwang et al., 2015; Katz et al., 2017; Sandmann
et al., 2017). This can be particularly problematic for outbreak
and cluster detection in bacterial pathogen surveillance: pairwise
SNP thresholds are currently widely used to make initial
decisions regarding the inclusion or exclusion of isolates in
a given outbreak (Taylor et al., 2015; Gymoese et al., 2017;
Mair-Jenkins et al., 2017; McCloskey and Poon, 2017; Walker
et al., 2018). In such scenarios, just a few SNPs can be the
deciding factor in whether a bacterial pathogen is included or
excluded as part of an outbreak or cluster (Katz et al., 2017),
rendering the choice of variant calling method as non-trivial.
Furthermore, choosing an appropriate variant calling pipeline
can be particularly challenging for pathogens where there are
limited data and expertise with WGS, as is currently the case with
B. cereus.
As demonstrated here, the choice of variant calling pipeline
can greatly influence the number of core SNPs identified in
B. cereus group isolates associated with a foodborne outbreak.
In the case of a multi-group outbreak, this effect can be
magnified. Naively calling variants in isolates that span multiple
B. cereus s.l. phylogenetic groups in aggregate can lead to
orders of magnitudes of difference in the number of core
SNPs identified by different variant calling pipelines/reference
genome combinations. In a multi-group outbreak scenario,
it is essential to note that one is effectively dealing with
genomic data from multiple species (i.e., ANI < 95), making
it impossible to find a reference genome that is closely related
to all isolates in a putative outbreak. In the case of some
reference-based pipelines that are specifically tailored to identify
variants in bacterial isolates from outbreaks (e.g., CFSAN,
which is not suited for bacteria differing by more than a
few hundred SNPs), calling variants in multiple groups or
within a distant reference genome is inappropriate (Davis et al.,
2015). Thus, querying outbreak isolates from multiple groups
in aggregate using reference-based variant calling methods
should be avoided. Furthermore, the results presented here
showcase the value of employing single- and/or multi-locus
typing approaches prior to variant calling, either via Sanger
sequencing or in silico using tools, such as BTyper, as they can
aid the design of downstream bioinformatics analyses, including
reference genome selection and data partitioning by phylogenetic
group.
When the three phylogenetic group IV isolates were excluded
from analyses, leaving only the emetic group III isolates,
the selection of reference genome caused fewer core SNP
discrepancies than choice of variant calling pipeline, provided
the reference genome was “similar” to the genomes analyzed.
While the selection of a reference genome for reference-
based variant calling is not trivial (Pightling et al., 2014;
Olson et al., 2015), reference-based variant calling using a
closed chromosome (B. cereus AH187) and a draft genome
(FOOD_10_19_16_RSNT1_2H_R9-6393) from two isolates that
were closely related to, or among the emetic group III
isolates sequenced in this outbreak produced nearly identical
results in terms of the number and identity of core SNPs
detected. Both reference genomes were identical to the emetic
group III outbreak isolates sequenced here in terms of panC
group, rpoB AT, MLST ST, and virulotype. Additionally, the
closed chromosome and draft genome had ANI values of
>99.8 and 99.9, respectively, relative to all emetic group III
outbreak isolates in this study, which can be considered highly
similar. Comparable findings have been observed in analyses of
Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg WGS data (Usongo et al.,
2018), suggesting that either closed genomes or high-quality draft
genomes are adequate for reference-based SNP calling, provided
both are similar enough to the outbreak strains being queried.
While the thresholds at which reference genomes become
“similar enough” and of sufficient quality for reference-based
SNP calling for outbreak detection warrant further investigation,
we have demonstrated here that, for emetic group III ST 26 B.
cereus group genomes, the publicly available closed chromosome
of B. cereus AH187 can serve as an adequate standard.
With regard to differences in the number of core SNPs
identified in the 30 emetic group III isolates using different
variant calling pipelines, the pipelines that used assembled
genomes as input (kSNP3 and Parsnp) produced higher numbers
of core SNPs than their counterparts that relied on short Illumina
reads. Additionally, when used to query core SNPs in 55 emetic
group III ST 26 B. cereus group genomes, both kSNP3 and
Parsnp produced core SNPs that yielded topologically similar
phylogenies. kSNP3 employs a reference-free k-mer based SNP
calling approach (Gardner and Hall, 2013; Gardner et al., 2015),
while Parsnp uses a reference-based core genome alignment
approach (Treangen et al., 2014), and both are useful for calling
variants in large data sets. These approaches are also valuable
when reads are not available for SNP calling (Olson et al.,
2015), as demonstrated here by the comparison of outbreak
genomes with publicly available genomes: core SNPs obtained
using both kSNP3 and Parsnp were able to consistently produce
phylogenies in which the 30 emetic isolates from this outbreak
formed a well-supported clade among all emetic group III ST 26
B. cereus group genomes. However, kSNP3 has been shown to
lack specificity relative to other pipelines (i.e., CFSAN, LYVE-
SET) when differentiating outbreak isolates from non-outbreak
isolates for L. monocytogenes, E. coli, and S. enterica (Katz et al.,
2017). Here, the CFSAN and LYVE-SET pipelines identified
similar SNPs that produced highly congruent phylogenies. This
is unsurprising, considering that both the CFSAN and LYVE-
SET pipelines were designed specifically for identifying SNPs in

closely related strains from outbreaks (Katz et al., 2017), and both
employ the most stringent filtering criteria of all pipelines tested
here.
As WGS Becomes Routinely Integrated
Into Food Safety, Clinical, and
Epidemiological Realms, It Is Likely That
the Number of Illnesses Attributed to B.
cereus Will Increase
Here, we offer the first description of a foodborne outbreak
caused by B. cereus group species to be characterized using
WGS, and we provide a glimpse into the genomic variation one
might expect within an emetic group III B. cereus outbreak using
several different variant calling pipelines. However, our ability
to query emetic group III genomes outside of this outbreak
is limited by the lack of publicly available genomic data and
metadata from emetic isolates. Of the 2,156 B. cereus group
genomes available in NCBI’s RefSeq database as of March 2018,
only 29 were from group III and possessed the cesABCD operon,
25 of which belonged to MLST ST 26. While not ideal, this
is an improvement, as there were only 19 emetic group III
genomes available in NCBI’s Genbank database in April 2017
(Carroll et al., 2017). As more B. cereus group WGS data—
particularly, data from emetic B. cereus group isolates—become
publicly available, more outbreaks and clusters are likely to be
resolved in tandem, a phenomenon that has been observed for
L. monocytogenes (Jackson et al., 2016). Additionally, variant
calling and cluster/outbreak detection methods for characterizing
B. cereus group isolates from foodborne outbreaks can be
further refined and optimized as more WGS, metadata and
epidemiological data become available for clinical and non-
clinical isolates.
