Cardiovascular Disease
A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.
Abstract
BACKGROUND—Loss-of-function variants in the angiopoietin-like 3 gene (ANGPTL3) have 
been associated with decreased plasma levels of triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. It is not known whether such variants 
or therapeutic antagonism of ANGPTL3 are associated with a reduced risk of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease.
METHODS—We sequenced the exons of ANGPTL3 in 58,335 participants in the DiscovEHR 
human genetics study. We performed tests of association for loss-of-function variants in 
ANGPTL3 with lipid levels and with coronary artery disease in 13,102 case patients and 40,430 
controls from the DiscovEHR study, with follow-up studies involving 23,317 case patients and 
107,166 controls from four population studies. We also tested the effects of a human monoclonal 
antibody, evinacumab, against Angptl3 in dyslipidemic mice and against ANGPTL3 in healthy 
human volunteers with elevated levels of triglycerides or LDL cholesterol.
RESULTS—In the DiscovEHR study, participants with heterozygous loss-of-function variants in 
ANGPTL3 had significantly lower serum levels of triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and LDL 
cholesterol than participants without these variants. Loss-of-function variants were found in 0.33% 
of case patients with coronary artery disease and in 0.45% of controls (adjusted odds ratio, 0.59; 
95% confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.85; P = 0.004). These results were confirmed in the follow-up 
studies. In dyslipidemic mice, inhibition of Angptl3 with evinacumab resulted in a greater 
decrease in atherosclerotic lesion area and necrotic content than a control antibody. In humans, 
evinacumab caused a dose-dependent placebo-adjusted reduction in fasting triglyceride levels of 
up to 76% and LDL cholesterol levels of up to 23%.
CONCLUSIONS—Genetic and therapeutic antagonism of ANGPTL3 in humans and of Angptl3 
in mice was associated with decreased levels of all three major lipid fractions and decreased odds 
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. (Funded by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and others;

 levels and cardiovascular disease risk. Loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL4, a negative 
regulator of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, are associated with decreased triglyceride 
levels, elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and a reduced risk of 
coronary heart disease in humans.1–5 In addition, loss-of-function variants in LPL have been 
shown to increase the risk of coronary artery disease, and gain-of-function variants have 
been shown to decrease the risk.6–8
ANGPTL3 is an endogenous inhibitor of LPL that is related to ANGPTL4. Rare loss-of-
function variants in ANGPTL3 have been shown to be associated with decreased triglyceride 
levels as well as decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and HDL cholesterol 
levels in family and general population studies of humans.2,9–19 Deletion of Angptl3 was 
also reported to reduce the development of atherosclerosis in Apoe-deficient mice.20
In this study, we examined the relationship between ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants and 
coronary artery disease in a large number of participants sampled from a large U.S. health 
care system, with follow-up studies in four population cohorts. We also evaluated the effects 
of pharmacologic antagonism of ANGPTL3 with a human monoclonal antibody on lipid 
metabolism and atherosclerosis in a mouse model of atherosclerosis and on lipid levels in 
human volunteers.

 ASCERTAINMENT OF ANGPTL3 LOSS-OF-FUNCTION VARIANTS AND ANGPTL3 
CONCENTRATION
In the DiscovEHR study, Penn, Duke, and TAICHI, ascertainment of ANGPTL3 loss-of-
function variants was performed by whole-exome sequencing at the Regeneron Genetics 
Center, as described in the Supplementary Appendix. In the Copenhagen population studies, 
participants were directly genotyped for the p.Ser17Ter, p.Asn121fs, p.Asn147fs, and c.
495+6T→C variants with the use of the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System 
(Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan-based assays or with the use of an allele-specific 
polymerase-chain-reaction system (KASPer, LGC Genomics). Quantification of serum 
ANGPTL3 concentration was performed as described in the Supplementary Appendix.
STUDIES IN ANIMALS
APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice, an established model for hyperlipidemia with all features of 
mixed or familial dysbetalipoproteinemia and atherosclerosis,27 were used for the evaluation 
of the effects of a fully human anti-ANGPTL3 monoclonal antibody, evinacumab 
(REGN1500), on atherosclerosis.28–30 (For antibody description and full experimental 
details, see the Supplementary Appendix.) A total of 50 female transgenic mice31 on a 
Western-type diet were matched to one control group (20 mice) and one evinacumab-treated 
group (30 mice) on the basis of body weight and plasma levels of total cholesterol and 
triglycerides and were treated with evinacumab or isotype-matched antibody with irrelevant 
specificity (control antibody) by weekly subcutaneous injections at a dose of 25 mg per 
kilogram of body weight for 13 weeks. Mice in which a mouse antihuman antibody response 
developed were excluded (see the Supplementary Appendix). At 13 weeks, the mice were 
euthanized and atherosclerosis development in the aortic root was measured (15 mice per 
group), as described in the Supplementary Appendix. The study was conducted at TNO 
Metabolic Health Research (the Netherlands). All experiments involving animals were 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Netherlands 
Organization for Applied Scientific Research.
EVINACUMAB CLINICAL TRIAL
A phase 1, first-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, ascending single-
dose clinical trial was performed to assess the safety, side-effect profile, and 
pharmacodynamics of REGN1500 (evinacumab) administered subcutaneously or 
intravenously to participants with varying degrees of dyslipidemia (see the Supplementary 
Appendix). The trial protocol is available at NEJM.org. The results for Group A of this trial 
are described in this report; Group A enrolled healthy men and women 18 to 65 years of age 
with a fasting triglyceride level of 150 to 450 mg per deciliter (1.7 to 5.1 mmol per liter) or 
an LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) or greater.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We used linear mixed models to test for associations of levels of total cholesterol, LDL 
cholesterol, log10 HDL cholesterol, and log10 triglycerides with genotype (for aggregated 
ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants and the individual variants p.Ser17Ter, p.Asn121fs, 
p.Asn147fs, and c.495+6T→C) in the DiscovEHR study. Odds ratios for coronary artery

 disease were estimated in each study with the use of logistic regression or Firth’s penalized 
likelihood method of logistic regression,32 as described in the Supplementary Appendix. We 
then performed an inverse-variance–weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis and a Mantel–
Haenszel fixed-effects meta-analysis of associations with coronary artery disease.
For the study in mice, the significance of the differences between groups was determined 
with the use of the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test for independent samples. For the 
clinical trial, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to compare the 
treatment effect in the evinacumab groups and the pooled placebo group; in the case of 
triglycerides, this was a rank-based ANCOVA. We used the following software programs for 
the statistical analyses of genetic data: GCTA software, version 1.2.433; PLINK software, 
version 2.0 (www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/); R software, versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.1 (R 
Project for Statistical Computing); SAS software, version 9.2; and SPSS software, version 
22. All reported P values are two-sided, and an alpha level of 0.05 was considered to 
indicate statistical significance.
RESULTS
LOSS-OF-FUNCTION VARIANTS IN ANGPTL3
In 58,335 adult DiscovEHR study participants of European ancestry, we identified and 
confirmed (through Sanger sequencing) 13 distinct loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL3, 
including 4 different premature stop variants, 6 different open reading frame–shifting 
insertion–deletion variants, and 3 splice variants (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population according to variant 
status are shown in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The most frequently observed ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants were p.Ser17Ter (in 21 
persons), which has been previously described to segregate with combined hypolipidemia in 
family studies14,16; p.Asn121fs (in 91 persons), which has been previously observed in a 
population sample and associated with reduced LDL cholesterol levels16; and a novel rare 
frame-shifting insertion–deletion variant at position 147 (p.Asn147fs, in 52 persons). A 
splice region variant, c.495+6T→C, was identified in 57 persons and was found to be 
associated with a decreased concentration of ANGPTL3 protein, similar to the other loss-of-
function variants; thus, it was included in all loss-of-function analyses. A total of 246 
persons were heterozygous for loss-of-function variants, corresponding to a total carrier 
frequency of 1 in 237 DiscovEHR study participants of European ancestry. As expected, 
given the allele frequencies, we did not find homozygotes or compound heterozygotes.
The median concentration of ANGPTL3 protein among 125 carriers of loss-of-function 
variants was 50 ng per milliliter (interquartile range, 38 to 62) and among 53 matched 
noncarriers was 99 ng per milliliter (interquartile range, 80 to 127) (P = 9.4×10−16 by 
Mann–Whitney U test). Protein abundance according to allele is shown in Figure 1.

 LOSS-OF-FUNCTION VARIANTS IN ANGPTL3, LIPID LEVELS, AND CORONARY ARTERY 
DISEASE
We performed tests of association between loss-of-function variants (both individually and 
aggregated over ANGPTL3) and median serum lipid measures in up to 45,226 persons in the 
DiscovEHR study who had documented lipid levels in the electronic health record (Table 1 
and Fig. 1, and Tables S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Overall, carriers of loss-
of-function variants had 27% lower triglyceride levels than noncarriers (P = 2.5×10−21), 9% 
lower LDL cholesterol levels (P = 2.8×10−5), and 4% lower HDL cholesterol levels (P = 
0.02), after adjustment for covariates.
We then tested for association between ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants and coronary 
artery disease. Overall, 43 of the 13,102 persons with coronary artery disease (cumulative 
carrier frequency, 0.33%) and 183 of the 40,430 controls (cumulative carrier frequency, 
0.45%) carried a loss-of-function variant. After adjustment for age, sex, and the principal 
components of ancestry, the presence of an ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variant was 
associated with a 41% lower odds of coronary artery disease (adjusted odds ratio for any 
loss-of-function variant, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.85; P = 0.004); these 
variants were also associated with numerically, but not significantly, lower odds of 
myocardial infarction (carrier frequencies, 0.36% among persons with myocardial infarction 
and 0.45% among controls; odds ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.06; P = 0.09). Individually, 
each of the four most abundant loss-of-function variants (p.Ser17Ter, p.Asn121fs, 
p.Asn147fs, and c.495+6T→C) was less frequent among case patients with coronary artery 
disease than among controls (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). In a subgroup of 
the sequenced cohort in which only 1 person in every first-degree and second-degree 
relationship was retained (9261 case patients and 29,778 controls), ANGPTL3 loss-of-
function variants were associated with lower odds of coronary artery disease (carrier 
frequencies, 0.31% among persons with coronary artery disease and 0.44% among controls; 
odds ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.94; P = 0.03).
We sought additional evidence of an association between ANGPTL3 loss-of-function 
variants and coronary artery disease in 23,317 case patients with coronary artery disease and 
107,166 controls from four independent population studies (Copenhagen General Population 
Study, Duke, Penn, and TAICHI) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). In these 
studies, we observed a numerically, but not significantly, lower odds of coronary artery 
disease among carriers of these variants (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.02; P = 0.06). 
An inverse-variance–weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of the association of ANGPTL3 
loss-of-function variants with coronary artery disease in the DiscovEHR study and these 
other population studies yielded an overall odds ratio of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.81; 
P<0.001) (Fig. 2). A Mantel–Haenszel fixed-effects meta-analysis, a method that is robust to 
low counts, yielded similar results (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.89; P = 0.006) 
without evidence of significant heterogeneity (Q = 3.94, I2 = 0%, P = 0.40 for 
heterogeneity).

 INHIBITION OF ANGPTL3 IN A MOUSE MODEL OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS
We evaluated the effect of an anti-ANGPTL3 monoclonal antibody candidate therapeutic30 
on atherosclerosis in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice. Evinacumab administration was 
associated with a significantly lower average total cholesterol level than the control antibody 
(difference, −52%; P<0.001) and a significantly lower triglyceride level (difference, −84%; 
P<0.001) by a reduction of the apoB-containing atherogenic lipoproteins (Fig. 3A through 
3D). Evinacumab was associated with a significantly greater decrease in atherosclerotic 
lesion size than the control antibody (difference, −39%; P<0.001) (Fig. 3E and 3F). 
Treatment with evinacumab was associated with a significantly greater decrease in necrotic 
content in severe type IV and V lesions than the control antibody (difference, −45%; P = 
0.001), but there were no significant differences in macrophage content, collagen content, or 
smooth muscle cell area (Fig. 3G and 3H).
ANGPTL3 INHIBITION WITH EVINACUMAB IN HEALTHY HUMAN VOLUNTEERS
We evaluated the effects of evinacumab on lipid levels in healthy human volunteers with 
mildly to moderately elevated levels of triglycerides (150 to 450 mg per deciliter) or LDL 
cholesterol (≥100 mg per deciliter). A total of 83 participants at three U.S. sites entered a 
single-ascending-dose trial involving randomization to evinacumab (administered 
subcutaneously or intravenously) or placebo in a 3:1 ratio (see the Methods section and Fig. 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The baseline characteristics of the participants are 
presented in Tables S8 and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The most frequent adverse event among the evinacumab-treated patients was headache 
(seven patients; 11%). Transient, single elevations of the alanine aminotransferase level to 
more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range were observed in two evinacumab-
treated patients (3%), both of whom had an alanine aminotransferase level above the upper 
limit of the normal range at baseline or screening. There were no discontinuations due to 
adverse safety events (Tables S10 and S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The time course of triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol responses to 
escalating doses of evinacumab or placebo are shown in Figure 4, and in Figures S2 and S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix. The magnitude and duration of lipid reductions (placebo-
corrected) were dose-proportional. The maximal changes in lipid levels found among 
patients who received a dose of 20 mg per kilogram intravenously were as follows: 
triglycerides, −76.0% (day 4); directly measured LDL cholesterol, −23.2% (day 15); and 
HDL cholesterol, −18.4% (day 15). A full summary of treatment effects is presented in 
Tables S12 through S17 in the Supplementary Appendix.
DISCUSSION
We performed whole-exome sequencing in 58,335 adult participants of European ancestry in 
the DiscovEHR study, which links genetic data to electronic health records in a large 
integrated health system, along with targeted genotyping of ANGPTL3 loss-of-function 
variants and whole-exome sequencing in four other population cohorts comprising 130,483 
persons. Using these methods, we identified more than 400 persons who harbor

 heterozygous loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL3. Persons heterozygous for ANGPTL3 
loss-of-function variants had approximately 50% lower ANGPTL3 levels than noncarriers 
and 39% lower odds of coronary artery disease. These results mirror the reduction in plasma 
lipid levels and atherosclerosis progression that we observed in dyslipidemic mice treated 
with evinacumab, a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of ANGPTL3. The pattern and 
magnitude of reduction in atherosclerotic lesion area that was observed in this mouse model 
treated with evinacumab was similar to that reported previously in the same mouse model 
treated with atorvastatin.34 Our results provide evidence that the combined hypolipidemia 
profile associated with genetic or therapeutic antagonism of ANGPTL3, which includes a 
reduction in levels of HDL cholesterol in addition to LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, is 
antiatherogenic.
ANGPTL3 inhibition affects lipid levels in several ways. Triglyceride reduction is mediated 
at least in part through disinhibition of LPL and subsequent hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich 
lipoproteins. HDL cholesterol reduction is mediated by disinhibition of endothelial lipase.
13,30 The reduction in LDL cholesterol levels with ANGPTL3 antagonism occurs through a 
mechanism that has yet to be elucidated. However, studies in Ldlr-deficient mice indicate 
that ANGPTL3 modulates LDL cholesterol in a manner that is independent of the LDL 
receptor and other known mechanisms responsible for clearance of plasma LDL cholesterol.
35 These findings suggest that therapeutic antagonism of ANGPTL3 should be efficacious in 
lowering LDL cholesterol levels in persons with a complete deficiency in LDL receptor–
mediated LDL cholesterol uptake, such as persons affected by homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia. Additional human genetics support for targeting this pathway is 
provided by evidence of similar reductions in coronary artery disease risk that are associated 
with inactivating variants in ANGPTL4,5 a related inhibitor of LPL, and genetic variants in 
LPL that increase LPL activity.6,7 Evidence to date does not suggest that genetic 
perturbation of LIPG, the gene encoding endothelial lipase, is associated with coronary 
artery disease, despite robust associations with HDL cholesterol levels.36
We also report here clinical pharmacology results from a trial involving therapeutic 
antagonism of ANGPTL3 in human volunteers treated with evinacumab. We found dose-
dependent reductions in levels of triglycerides and LDL cholesterol that appear to 
recapitulate the lipid phenotype of patients with ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants. In 
addition to the ANGPTL3 loss-of-function heterozygotes in this study, more than 200 
heterozygous carriers and more than 20 homozygotes of ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants 
have been reported by others with no apparent negative effects on cardiometabolic traits and 
diseases evaluated in these participants.14,37,38 A recent study has shown an association 
between ANGPTL3 deficiency and protection from coronary artery disease,38 a finding 
consistent with those of our study. In aggregate, these data support further investigation of 
inhibition of ANGPTL3 as a therapeutic target for lipid modification and possible reduction 
in the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans.
Our study has limitations. Our human genetics studies largely involved persons of European 
ancestry; it is not known whether our observations will generalize to persons of other 
ancestries. We did not directly evaluate coronary atherosclerosis progression; instead, we 
evaluated aortic atherosclerosis progression in a mouse model. The sample size of our

 clinical trial was limited, and the trial included healthy human volunteers, not those selected 
for severe dyslipidemias or established cardiovascular disease. Finally, the associations with 
lipid levels and coronary artery disease in our human genetics studies were observed in 
heterozygotes who had a reduction in ANGTPL3 levels of approximately 50%, which had 
probably been present since birth. Whether such observations accurately reflect the 
phenotypic effects of a more complete blockade of ANGPTL3 later in life, with the use of a 
monoclonal antibody, is not clear.
In conclusion, we observed that loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL3 were associated with 
a reduced risk of coronary artery disease, mirroring the antiatherogenic effects of inhibition 
of Angptl3 by monoclonal antibody in mice. In human volunteers, monoclonal antibody 
inhibition of ANGPTL3 was associated with dose-dependent reductions in LDL cholesterol 
and triglyceride levels.

 Figure 1. Loss-of-Function Variants in ANGPTL3 and Lipid Levels in Humans
The top of the diagram shows the organization of the ANGPTL3 protein, which is 460 
amino acids long. Functional sections of the protein are marked in varying colors and 
demarcated with lines labeled to show the numbering of the amino acid sequence for each 
section. Beneath the protein diagram, the individual protein-sequence variants are listed in 
order of their position in the protein. Beneath the protein-sequence variants are plots of 
ANGPTL3 concentration and lipid levels. The red lines indicate the median value for each 
level among all carriers of loss-of-function variants. Each point represents a trait value for a

indicates the median value for each trait for all sequenced persons not carrying a loss-of-
function variant in ANGPTL3. To convert the values for cholesterol to millimoles per liter, 
multiply by 0.02586. To convert the values for triglycerides to millimoles per liter, multiply 
by 0.01129. HDL denotes high-density lipoprotein, LDL low-density lipoprotein, and SP 
signal peptide.

 Figure 2. Association of ANGPTL3 Loss-of-Function Variants and Coronary Artery Disease
The association between the ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants and coronary artery 
disease (CAD) was tested in each study with the use of logistic regression or Firth’s 
penalized likelihood logistic regression. Combined effects were determined by inverse-
variance– weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis. For each study, the square indicates the odds 
ratio and the line indicates the 95% confidence interval. The square size is proportional to 
the precision of the estimate. For the combined estimate, the center of the diamond indicates 
the odds ratio for the meta-analysis, with the left and right corners of the diamond indicating 
the boundaries of the 95% confidence interval. ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants were 
ascertained by means of targeted genotyping in the Copenhagen General Population Studies 
(CGPS) and by means of exome sequencing in the other studies. Duke denotes the Duke 
Catheterization Genetics cohort, GHS Geisinger Health System (DiscovEHR study), Penn 
the University of Pennsylvania Medicine BioBank, and TAICHI the Taiwan Metabochip 
consortium.

 Figure 3. (facing page). Effect of Inhibition of Angptl3 with a Monoclonal Antibody in 
APOE*3Leiden.CETP Mice
Evinacumab reduced plasma levels of total cholesterol (Panel A) and triglycerides (Panel B) 
in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice throughout the 13 weeks of the study. Plasma lipoproteins 
were separated on fast protein liquid chromatography at the end of the study and assessed 
for total cholesterol (Panel C) and triglycerides (Panel D). Representative images of 
atherosclerotic lesions (hematoxylin–phloxine–saffron stain) in a cross section of the aortic 
root area that was used for area quantification are shown (Panel E); the total atherosclerotic 
lesion area per cross section was evaluated at the end of the study (Panel F). Macrophage

(SMC) and collagen content (indicators of lesion stability) (Panel H) were determined in the 
severe (type IV and V) lesions and normalized to lesion size. All values in Panels A, B, and 
F through H are means ±SE. For Panels A through D, 14 mice were given the control 
antibody and 22 were given evinacumab. The analysis conducted in Panels E through H 
involved 14 mice given the control antibody and 15 given evinacumab. VLDL denotes very-
