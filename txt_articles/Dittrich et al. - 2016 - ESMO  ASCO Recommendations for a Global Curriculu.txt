ABSTRACT
The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)
and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
are publishing a new edition of the ESMO/ASCO Global
Curriculum (GC) thanks to contribution of 64 ESMO-
appointed and 32 ASCO-appointed authors. First
published in 2004 and updated in 2010, the GC edition
2016 answers to the need for updated
recommendations for the training of physicians in
medical oncology by defining the standard to be
fulfilled to qualify as medical oncologists. At times of
internationalisation of healthcare and increased mobility
of patients and physicians, the GC aims to provide
state-of-the-art cancer care to all patients wherever they
live. Recent progress in the field of cancer research
has indeed resulted in diagnostic and therapeutic
innovations such as targeted therapies as a standard
therapeutic approach or personalised cancer medicine
apart from the revival of immunotherapy, requiring
specialised training for medical oncology trainees.
Thus, several new chapters on technical contents such
as molecular pathology, translational research or
molecular imaging and on conceptual attitudes towards
human principles like genetic counselling or
survivorship have been integrated in the GC. The GC
edition 2016 consists of 12 sections with 17
subsections, 44 chapters and 35 subchapters,
respectively. Besides renewal in its contents, the GC
underwent a principal formal change taking into
consideration modern didactic principles. It is
presented in a template-based format that
subcategorises the detailed outcome requirements into
learning objectives, awareness, knowledge and skills.
Consecutive steps will be those of harmonising and
implementing teaching and assessment strategies.

 1 INTRODUCTION
Christian Dittrich
Michael Kosty
With the increasing internationalisation of healthcare
as well as the increased exchange of specialists and
knowledge across borders, the European Society for
Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) identified more than a
decade ago the need for a set of international recom-
mendations for the clinical training of physicians to
qualify them as medical oncologist. Patients, wherever
they live, should have an equal chance of receiving
state-of-the-art treatment from well-trained physicians.
In 2004, a joint ESMO/ASCO Task Force produced
the first outline for a Global Core Curriculum (GCC)
for training in medical oncology. This outline was subse-
quently distributed to universities as well as medical
oncology societies and was simultaneously published in
the
Annals
of
Oncology
and
the
Journal
of
Clinical
Oncology.1 2 The Global Curriculum (GC) Task Force
also produced a Log Book as a support tool for medical
oncologists in training and their supervisors with the
purpose of keeping a record of oncology trainees’ edu-
cational programmes and their progress.3 4
Interest in using the GCC outline has increased
considerably since its inception, as evidenced by transla-
tions in different languages available on the ESMO and
ASCO websites.5 6 It is also used as a model for the devel-
opment of the specialty of medical oncology in several
countries around the world. The GCC was updated in
2010.7 8 The corresponding Log Book was updated in
2016 by the Global Curriculum Working Group (GC
WG) which evolved from the GC Task Force.9 10
In 2011, the European Commission based its formal
recognition of medical oncology as a medical specialty
on the recommendations of the ESMO/ASCO GC.11
The Curriculum 2010 covered a broad range of
recommendations to be adopted by national educational
and health authorities and to be implemented accord-
ing to the resources and conditions of their countries.
Furthermore, it was perceived that the diversity of health
and educational systems around the world may have ren-
dered some curriculum recommendations aspirational
at the stage of its implementation, even for those systems
with well-developed training programmes in medical
oncology. Reflecting this aspirational nature of the
recommendations,
the
former
GC
Task
Force
had
changed the updated Curriculum title from ‘Global
Core Curriculum’ to ‘Global Curriculum’.
An analysis of the ESMO GC European Landscape
data still identified a high degree of heterogeneity,
mainly at the organisational level as well as in the dur-
ation and structure of the internal medicine part of the
training in medical oncology in Europe.12 This hetero-
geneity relates to whether or not medical oncology is
recognised as separate specialty in each country and to
the degree of adoption, adaptation and applicability of
the GC recommendations by the different countries in
Europe. Despite the unequivocal progress towards the
establishment of medical oncology and the harmonisa-
tion of its implementation in Europe and beyond, this
effort has to be pursued further.
Important advances in medical oncology have been
achieved in recent years, notably in the integration of
molecular pathology and molecular profiling to deter-
mine the presence of biomarkers as a rationale for the
appropriate selection of new therapies. The unequivocal
demands of personalised medicine and of completely
different developments like the constantly increasing
survivorship community—to mention two examples of
the changes in oncology over the last few years—have let
us to prepare a new edition of the GC.
With regard to content, multiple changes and innova-
tions have been taken into account in the GC 2016, such as:
• targeted therapies are integrated into the (sub)chap-
ters of the separate tumour entities wherever suitable;
• immunotherapy
is
presented
in
a
new
separate
chapter to reflect its actual impact;
• biological therapy and immunotherapy are now pre-
sented in separate chapters;
• pathology, molecular pathology, laboratory medicine,
translational research and principles of personalised
cancer medicine have been transformed into separate
chapters due to their importance, accepting therewith
even some unavoidable overlap;
• tumour immunology has been separated into ‘tumour
immunology’ which was kept under ‘basic scientific
principles’, and into ‘immunotherapy’ which was
shifted as separate chapter to the subsection ‘therapy’;
• imaging and molecular imaging have been separated
into two chapters and are followed by the additional
chapter on ‘RECIST’;
• rare cancers have been established as a novel subsection;
• cancer treatment in patients with comorbidities is
treated in a new subsection;
• genetic counselling is given increased attention due
to its emerging role in the clinical routine as a separ-
ate section;
• survivorship with its tremendously increasing impact is
presented in a separate section.
There exist general attitudes or conceptions, respect-
ively, which are of importance for several or all tumour
entities; therefore, separate (sub)sections have been
dedicated to them:
• integration of palliative or supportive care measures;
• consideration of psychosocial aspects;
• consideration of adequate communication;
• provision of bioethical, legal or economic issues.
In addition to the integration of novel contents, it
seemed necessary to change the format of the GC 2016
according to actually acknowledged pedagogical princi-
ples. Therefore, a template-based framework is used that
subcategorises the quality of the outcome requirements
of detailed learning objectives into awareness, knowl-
edge and skills, where appropriate. As far as applicable,

 the more general teaching items are also presented in
this new format.
References provided in the GC 2016 can be used for the
training and the individual information, but the trainees
should feel stimulated not only to restrict their learning
process to these citations but also to use other sources
such as guidelines or e-learning tools offered by the two
carrier societies and by other authorities.
Although the GC 2016 is very comprehensive, it does
not claim to be a textbook. Moreover, it is the intention
of the GC to represent a meticulously structured collec-
tion of requirements to be fulfilled in order to qualify as
medical oncologist. A corresponding Log Book for the
documentation of the assessment of the learning pro-
gress according to the GC 2016 will follow.

2 STANDARD REQUIREMENTS FOR TRAINING IN MEDICAL
ONCOLOGY
Michael Kosty
on behalf of the ESMO/ASCO GC Working Group
The standard requirement is for a total training period
of at least 5 years, beginning with training in internal
medicine for 2–3 years, followed by a training programme
in medical oncology for a minimum of 2–3 years.
The training programme in medical oncology must
include full-time clinical training in the diagnosis and
management of a broad spectrum of neoplastic diseases
comprising solid tumours and haematological malignan-
cies. Trainees should have access to a wide variety of
general and specialty consultative support, including
general surgery and surgical subspecialties, internal
medicine and its subspecialties, as well as pathology,
laboratory medicine, diagnostic and therapeutic radi-
ology, psychiatry, neurology, physiotherapy and nutrition.
Full-time clinical training means that the trainee’s pro-
fessional time and effort during a standard working week
is dedicated to clinical activities (patient care or educa-
tion). These may include the primary care of patients with
cancer, supervision of patients with cancer on the general
medical
service
or
in
designated
medical
oncology
inpatient units, oncological consultations and consultation
rounds, oncology ambulatory and day unit care, scheduled
clinical conferences, performance
of procedures
on
patients, review of imaging, pathology and other diagnos-
tic materials, other direct patient care, attending national
and international scientific meetings and reading relevant
literature. There should be multidisciplinary tumour con-
ferences held on a regular basis, and trainees should be
active participants in these conferences.
Clinical activities may also include research involving
patient contact, care and treatment. Research activities
of a maximum of 6 months may be counted for the total
training period of at least 5 years. Research experience
of longer duration, including international training, is
strongly recommended, especially for oncologists who
want to pursue an academic career.

 The trainee will maintain a record of his/her training.
The programme leader will countersign it, as appropriate,
to confirm the satisfactory fulfilment of the required train-
ing experience and the acquisition of the competencies
that are gained in the specialty curriculum. The record
will remain the property of the trainee and must be signed
at the annual reviews by the responsible programme
leader/director of medical oncology training programme.
3.2 Faculty
3.2.1 Faculty members
The medical oncology programme faculty must include
a minimum of three full-time, qualified teaching faculty
members, including the programme leader. All the
faculty members must be certified in medical oncology
or possess equivalent qualifications and each of them
must devote substantial time (at least 10 hours per
week) to clinical rounds, teaching and research, with the
trainees as well as to the critical evaluation of the per-
formance, progress and competence of the trainees.
3.2.2 Faculty standards
The teaching staff must demonstrate an interest in teach-
ing, and set an example for trainees by documented
engagement in the following pursuits: actively sharing
the personal experience of working in a medical oncol-
ogy clinical practice and multidisciplinary team; continu-
ing his/her own medical education; active membership
in regional, national and international scientific soci-
eties; ideally active participation in research and presen-
tation and publication of scientific studies.
3.3 Educational Programme
The educational programme in medical oncology must be
organised to provide training and experience at a level
high enough for the trainee to acquire the competency of
a specialist in the field. The programme must emphasise
scholarship, self-instruction, development of critical ana-
lysis of clinical problems and the ability to make appropri-
ate decisions, in addition to active involvement in regularly
scheduled conferences and multidisciplinary clinics and/
or tumour boards. Appropriate supervision of the trainees
must be provided for the duration of their educational
experience. The programme should foster all aspects of
the roles required of an oncologist, including being an
effective communicator with patients, a collaborator in the
treatment team, a manager of the healthcare system, a
health advocate not just for the patient but for the com-
munity and a scholar with lifelong commitment and high
professional ethics and standards.
The following principles require special emphasis:
3.3.1 Educational environment
Medical oncology training programmes must provide an
intellectual environment for acquisition of the knowl-
edge, skills, clinical judgement and attitudes essential to
the practice of medical oncology in the context of multi-
disciplinary care. This objective can only be achieved
when appropriate resources and facilities are available.
Service commitments must not compromise the achieve-
ment of educational goals and objectives.
3.3.2 Professionalism
Professionalism must be fostered during medical oncol-
ogy training. In addition to mastering the comprehensive
clinical and technical skills of the consultant medical
oncologist, trainees are encouraged to participate in the
educational activities of professional organisations, com-
munity programmes and institutional committees.
3.3.3 Responsibility
Lines of responsibility must be clearly delineated for the
trainees in medical oncology.
3.3.4 Update of skills and knowledge
Having obtained certification in medical oncology, the
specialist is expected to update the acquired skills and
knowledge
by
participating
in
Continuing
Medical
Education programmes such as courses, symposia or
self-learning processes on a regular basis.
3.3.5 Perception of other specialties
It is also essential to have the support of oncology
nursing, pharmacy, emergency medicine, intensive care,
rehabilitation medicine, palliative care medicine, and
dietetic and psychosocial services so that the trainee can
perceive the role of other specialties in the total care of
the patient with cancer.
3.3.6 Institutional requirements
3.3.6.a Clinical setting
The
clinical
setting
must
include
opportunities
to
observe and manage patients with a wide variety of neo-
plastic diseases on an inpatient and outpatient basis.
The trainee must be given the opportunity to assume
the continuing responsibility for acute and chronically
ill patients in order to learn the natural history of
cancer, the extent of the effectiveness of the various
therapeutic programmes and how to impart information
to the patient, including bad news. The scenario should
include everything from prevention, treatment, to the
long-term follow-up of patients with cancer.
3.3.6.b Hospital facilities
Modern inpatient, ambulatory care and laboratory facil-
ities necessary for the overall educational programme
must be available and functioning. Specifically, at the
primary site, there must be adequate pathology services,
modern
diagnostic
radiology services,
resources
for
nuclear medicine imaging, blood banking and blood
therapy facilities and facilities for clinical pharmacology
and tumour immunology/biology. A general surgical
service and its support must be available, in addition to
access to radiation therapy. The programme must also
include
a
set-up
for
multidisciplinary

4 COMPETENCIES REQUIRED IN THE CURRICULUM
Julia Lee Close
Michael Kosty
Jill Gilbert
The following curriculum should be considered as the
educational framework for the training of physicians in
medical oncology. The current version represents an
expansion of each topic to now include more specific
details on curricular content. Each topic is divided into
four areas: Objectives, Awareness, Knowledge and Skills.
The ‘Objectives’ section provides an overview of the
scope of knowledge a trainee is expected to master in the
topic. ‘Awareness’ defines components integral to the
topic. ‘Knowledge’ provides a listing of concepts neces-
sary to practice. ‘Skills’ provides the activities included in
practicing oncology in the specific area covered.
4.1 Basic scientific principles
Ahmad Awada
As a foundation for managing and treating malignant
disease, the trainee should learn and understand the
following:
1. The hallmarks of cancer including the complexity of
cancer cell biology and the interaction with the
tumour microenvironment (immune system, etc);
2. The management and treatment of malignant dis-
eases (by organ and/or by biological subtypes);
3. Specific systemic anticancer therapies (cytotoxics/
cytostatics, (anti)hormones, biological agents (inter-
feron, IL-2), targeted agents (small molecules) and
immunotherapeutics (monoclonal antibodies));
4. Supportive measures in relation to all kinds of sys-
temic anticancer therapies;
5. Palliative measures including end-of-life care;
6. How to properly conduct and participate in transla-
tional and clinical research.
It should be noted that the management and treat-
ment of malignant diseases are continuously evolving
fields, in view of the advances in molecular biology and
imaging techniques. In addition, a multidisciplinary
approach to malignant diseases is the basis for optimal
quality of patient care.

4.2 Basic Principles in the Management and Treatment of
Malignant Diseases
Hans-Joachim Schmoll
The management of malignant diseases requires the
expertise of many different medical subspecialties, and
the majority of patients with malignant diseases are best
managed in a multidisciplinary approach with the inte-
gration of the various subspecialties because of the
increasing complexity of modern treatment. The trainee
should recognise the contributions of each of these sub-
specialties in making the diagnosis, assessing disease
stage and treating the underlying disease and its compli-
cations, as well as those derived from its treatment. The
trainee should interact with each of these disciplines in
order to gain an appreciation of the benefits and limita-
tions of each modality. Participation of the trainee in
multidisciplinary meetings is encouraged. The trainee
should be capable of assessing the patient’s comorbid
medical conditions that may affect the toxicity and effi-
cacy of treatment, in order to formulate a treatment
plan and be aware of the special conditions that influ-
ence the treatment of the growing population of elderly
patients with malignant disorders.

4.2.5 Principles of personalised cancer medicine
Luigi De Petris
Jonas Bergh
Objectives
• To be able to integrate biomarker analysis of prognostic and therapy predictive factors into the treatment-
decision process, aiming at personalised medicine (precision medicine) therapy selection based on the
individual patient’s marker signatures in the cancer cells and normal cells, respectively
• To understand that proper marker analyses and interpretation are the bases for personalised cancer medicine
Awareness
• Recognition that a biomarker should prognosticate and predict response to specific therapies, being an
indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic and pathological processes; the marker must have
analytical and clinical validity (verifications and replications in several independent data sets) as well as
clinical utility, adding clinical value for management
• Awareness that each marker platform should either be analysed centrally in a certified laboratory or, if
analysed locally, it should be validated locally, prior to clinical implementation
• Recognition that, in the absence of a specific prognostic and/or predictive target, but linked to a high tumour
biology significance, results from unsupervised high-throughput analyses, validated on independent data sets,
may rely on extensive bioinformatics processing of raw data
• Awareness that molecular features may be heterogeneous in different areas of the same tumour lesion and
may differ between the primary tumour and the corresponding distant metastases, and between the latter
ones, which underlines the need for ‘liquid biopsies’ and functional target imaging
• Recognition that molecular characterisation of a tumour in patients should not only focus on the tumour cells
but also involve characterisation of the microenvironment, including the tumour stroma, angiogenesis and
tumour–host immune interactions
Knowledge
• Understanding of the critical importance of prospective biobanking of tumour (frozen and paraffin-embedded
material) and corresponding normal samples (normal tissue, normal genomic DNA) for research purposes and
for retrospective analyses in cases of clinical implementation of novel tests, and for routine use for some
upcoming markers
• Understanding of the proper terminology for high-throughput Omics technologies (genomics (gene expression
and RNA sequencing, exome sequencing and whole sequencing), proteomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics,
metabolomics, lipidomics)
• Understanding of the general principles of targeted (PCR, FISH, IHC) and non-targeted (NGS, mRNA assays)
technologies for molecular analysis (see chapter 4.2.2 and 4.2.3)
• Familiarity with the definition of diagnostic, prognostic, therapy-predictive and surrogate biomarkers,
respectively
• Familiarity with the statistical basis required to interpret the performance of a biomarker (sensitivity, specificity,
positive- and negative-predictive values, accuracy, identification of an optimal cut-off value (receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves), hazard ratios (HRs), interaction test for therapy prediction of outcomes)

4.3 Therapy
Pia Österlund
Gunta Purkalne
on behalf of the ESMO/ASCO GC Working Group
Medical oncology includes a wide variety of treatment
modalities. The key to cure or efficient palliation is often a
combination of treatment modalities, and thus basic knowl-
edge of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy,
targeted drugs and other systemic treatments is essential,
but not enough. Surgery, radiotherapy and radioisotopes
are additional substantial parts of the medical oncologist’s
toolbox to be considered. Knowledge of the opportunities
and limitations of the different treatment modalities is of
utmost
importance
in
multidisciplinary
team
work.
Supportive/palliative care modalities, such as nutritional
therapy, physiotherapy, psychosocial support etc, facilitate
the use of these therapeutic options, and basic knowledge
of these measures is mandatory.

the role of nephron-sparing procedures in RCC as well as the increasing use of laparoscopy
• To understand that RCC is a metabolic disease and that is not just one cancer, but that there are many
different histological categories of RCC often with different genetic associated abnormalities
• To be aware of the novel systemic therapies, including antiangiogenic therapies, inhibitors of the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and novel immunotherapy; the expanded role of molecular targeted
treatments has dramatically changed the treatment paradigm of RCC

as well as possible paraneoplastic aspects of the disease and palliation of advanced disease
Awareness
• Awareness of how to classify and stage localised disease and metastatic disease

• Awareness that improved survival has been obtained with the approval of several novel targeted agents in the
last decade, particularly directed against angiogenesis, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
mTOR pathways
• Appreciation that new studies have shown improved survival with novel checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy
and novel targeted agents, which are thus far in the second-line setting
Knowledge
• Knowledge of the different types of focal therapy in use, including enucleation, partial nephrectomy,
cryotherapy and hyperthermia and that laparoscopic surgery plays a large role in the treatment of smaller
tumours for localised disease
• Understanding that radical nephrectomy, as well, is often performed with laparoscopic or robotic techniques
• Knowledge about the newer staging systems for assessing risk in patients with metastatic disease
• Knowledge of the studies in first- and second-line therapy for patients with metastatic disease that have led to
overall improved survival in patients with metastatic clear cell RCC
• Knowledge about the new studies with checkpoint inhibition, and ongoing studies with combination therapies
and vaccines
• Knowledge about the studies that have been conducted in patients with non-clear cell RCC
• Understanding that, in contrast to many other cancers, metastasectomy for oligometastatic disease has an
important role, in particular, for clear cell RCC management and should be discussed at the multidisciplinary
team meetings
• Familiarity with results available from the adjuvant studies with targeted therapy
• Familiarity with the study results that are available and the ongoing studies in the adjuvant setting, and in the
setting of targeted therapy in evaluating the role of nephrectomy

 4.5.4.b Urothelial cancer
Maria De Santis
Cora N Sternberg
Objectives
• To understand the risk factors associated with urothelial cancers and the recommendations about cessation of
smoking at any stage of disease
• To be able to distinguish between non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)
disease and to know the implications for progression, recurrence, spread, prognosis and treatment
• To be able to appreciate the role of urine cytology, and to know how to use diagnostic imaging and
cystoscopy in the staging and follow-up of patients
• To know the role of intravesical therapy in the management of NMIBC, as well as the role of salvage
instillation and surgery in recurrent, progressive non-muscle invasive and early-stage invasive cancers
• To understand the advantages and disadvantages and indications for radical cystectomy and lymph node
dissection and definitive chemo-radiotherapy or trimodality treatment for MIBC
• To be able to distinguish the clinical prognostic groups and eligibility for standard chemotherapy with cisplatin
• To know about alternative treatment options for cisplatin-ineligible patients
• To understand that there are scarce treatment options for platinum-failing patients and that ongoing research
is promising for antiangiogenic treatment, targeted therapies and immunotherapy
Awareness
• Awareness that the most common presenting symptom is painless haematuria
• Awareness that 80% of diagnosed cases of MIBC present as primary invasive bladder cancer and only 15%
of patients have a history of mainly high-risk NMIBC
• Awareness that the pathological diagnosis according to the WHO classification is mostly made from a biopsy
obtained during transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT) and that 90% are transitional cell
carcinomas (TCC); new molecular classifications in addition to histological subgroups have been described
• Appreciation that, at TURBT, complete resection of all tumour tissue is aimed at whenever possible
• Recognition that carcinoma in situ (CIS) has been shown to be an adverse prognostic factor; bladder biopsies
should be taken from suspicious areas
• Awareness that MIBC requires further imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI)
• Awareness that cystectomy or chemo-radiotherapy following maximal TURBT are curative treatment options
for MIBC
• Recognition that perioperative chemotherapy is a standard of care for cisplatin-eligible patients; the body of
evidence is stronger for neoadjuvant than for adjuvant chemotherapy but both options are recommended.
More patients are able to receive neoadjuvant, ie, preoperative than adjuvant chemotherapy
• Awareness that, for systemic treatment of MIBC, eligibility for cisplatin has been defined and separates
patients for standard chemotherapy or alternative treatment options with mostly carboplatin-based
chemotherapy
• Awareness that there are several standard combination chemotherapy options with cisplatin that have different
safety profiles
• Awareness of other less common pathologies than TCC that may be found and that have different treatment
options
Knowledge
• Knowledge that smoking is the major risk factor for bladder cancer and that smoking cessation improves
outcomes
• Knowledge of the mandatory diagnostic procedures, the required full-body imaging for staging and the
definitive treatment options for NMIBC and MIBC
• Knowledge of correct allocation of adjuvant instillation therapies with chemotherapy and Bacillus Calmette-
Guérin (BCG) for different stages of NMIBC
• Knowledge of the options of early cystectomy or rechallenge instillation therapy in high-risk or recurrent,
progressive NMIBC
• Knowledge of the results and the amount of benefit shown in the most important studies and meta-analyses
about perioperative (neoadjuvant and adjuvant) chemotherapy for MIBC
• Knowledge that perioperative chemotherapy is a standard of care that should be discussed at the
multidisciplinary tumour board before radical treatment and offered to patients eligible for cisplatin-based
chemotherapy
• Familiarity with the most common urinary diversions and reconstruction by ileal conduit or bladder
replacement, depending on tumour characteristics and patient choice
• Knowledge that age is no limiting factor for surgery although postoperative morbidity increases with age

Objectives
• To appreciate the role of human papilloma virus (HPV) and ethnic background as well as hygienic standards
in the aetiology of penile cancers
• To understand the importance of staging and, in particular, of lymph node staging for prognosis and for treatment
• To understand the potentially curative role of surgery and radiation treatment
• To understand the role of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease
Awareness
• Awareness that squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for more than 95% of cases of penile cancer and
that currently no molecular biomarkers have shown to be useful in clinical practice
• Awareness that, at the time of diagnosis, almost half of palpable inguinal nodes are enlarged due to
inflammatory changes
• Appreciation that accurate staging is important for prognosis and adequate local (more or less radical) or
combined treatment
• Awareness of the multimodal treatment approaches that include different surgical tools and radiotherapy
• Awareness that, due to the rarity of the disease, level 1 evidence for systemic treatment approaches is lacking
and that chemotherapy, mostly cisplatin-based, has a palliative therapeutic role for metastatic disease
Knowledge
• Knowledge about the different approaches for staging and in particular of lymph node staging
• Knowledge that early detection of lymph node metastases by dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB) and
subsequent resection in clinically node negative T2–3 penile cancer improves survival
• Knowledge that if no DSNB is available, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology (FNAC)
biopsy of visualised nodes can be used for staging
• Knowledge about stage-dependent local treatments like penile-preserving techniques, including topical
therapy for low-disease stages, possible wide local excision plus reconstructive surgery, new laser therapy
approaches, radiotherapy delivered as external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy with
interstitial implants, and partial surgery approaches or penectomy for high-tumour stages
• Knowledge that, for non-palpable, enlarged and biopsy- or DSNB-positive lymph nodes, lymphadenectomy is
recommended
• Knowledge that, for unilateral or bilateral palpable inguinal nodes, FNA of the lymph node is standard
diagnostic procedure
• Knowledge that, when pelvic lymph nodes are enlarged, systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy with
concurrent chemotherapy are reasonable treatment options
• Understanding that patients with non-fixed nodes can be considered for inguinal node dissection with the
option to use a skin flap to cover the defect
• Understanding that patients with fixed nodes should be considered for neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy and
responders can receive consolidation surgery
• Understanding that patients with disease progression or unresectable lymph nodes should be considered for
additional systemic chemotherapy or local-field radiotherapy
• Knowledge that, for metastatic penile cancer, treatment options include systemic chemotherapy or
radiotherapy or radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy

• Ability to council patients and discuss in multidisciplinary tumour boards the management of enlarged pelvic
lymph nodes with systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy
• Ability to discuss side effects of surgery and, in particular, lymph node dissection and chemoradiation of pelvic
and inguinal lymph nodes
• Ability to discuss the treatment of patients with fixed nodes with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and potential
consolidation surgery

bone scans
• Awareness of the side effects (such as decreased libido) and metabolic side effects and toxicities associated
with androgen deprivation therapy
• Awareness of the novel therapies that have been developed for CRPC and that CRPC remains driven by
androgen receptor (AR) signalling and that AR alterations are likely selected during androgen deprivation
therapy
• Awareness of the changing paradigm in the treatment of hormone-sensitive metastatic disease and the trend
towards early use of chemotherapy in association with androgen deprivation therapy in patients who present
with widely metastatic disease
• Awareness of the novel therapies that have been approved for patients with CRPC that have improved overall
survival and of the bone-targeting agents which are approved in this setting
• Appreciation of the increasing literature on prostate cancer heterogeneity and that 90% of metastatic CRPC
patients harbour clinically actionable molecular alterations
• Awareness of the emerging literature on active agents to treat patients with DNA repair defects

based so far
• Understanding that skills training around communication should be a mandatory part of all fellowships and
training opportunities in oncology
Skills
• Ability to communicate cancer, from explaining a diagnosis, reviewing treatment options, to discussing
prognosis

9 SURVIVORSHIP
Elizabeth Charlotte Moser
Charles L Shapiro
Lifang Liu
In cancer, survivorship—as defined by the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) of the USA—begins at the time
of initial diagnosis and continues until the end of life.
Family members, friends and caregivers are also affected
by the survivorship experience and are included in this
definition. However, not all individuals who are treated
for cancer wish to be called survivors and in some coun-
tries other than USA, the term may not carry the same
positive cultural associations.
