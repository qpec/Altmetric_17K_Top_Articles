Abstract
Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the risk for adverse events reporting bias in systematic reviews of health care interven-
tions registered to PROSPERO.
Study Design and Setting: This study was a retrospective cohort study. Systematic review protocols in PROSPERO were screened and
included if they focused on a health care intervention and listed an adverse event as either a primary or secondary outcome. The included
systematic reviews were assessed to determine the completeness of reporting for the adverse event outcomes. Any discrepancies in report-
ing between protocol and review were recorded.
Results: Of 1,376 protocols for systematic reviews sifted, only 524 (38%) listed adverse events outcomes. One hundred eighty-six pro-
tocols were published in 2017 and 2018, of which 146 were included in our analysis. Among the included systematic reviews, 65% (95/146)
fully reported the adverse event outcomes as intended by the protocol, 8% (12/146) entirely excluded the adverse event outcome, and the
remaining 27% (39/146) either partially reported or changed the adverse event outcomes.
Conclusion: Sixty-two percent of reviews did not mention adverse events in their protocol, and 35% of PROSPERO-registered system-
atic reviews had discrepant outcome reporting between the protocol and publication. The findings suggest a need for the encouraged use of
harms reporting guidelines and further research into adverse events reporting bias.

1. Introduction
Adverse events are undesired negative outcomes, which
can occur during or after an intervention, such as a drug or
procedure, which may or may not be caused by the interven-
tion, but for which there is at least a possibility of causation
[1]. Adverse events, sometimes referred to as harms, are
often rare and long-term, making them difficult to analyze
and report as outcomes of an intervention [2]. It is also com-
mon for outcomes that are measures of an intervention’s ef-
ficacy to be the focus of outcome reporting in studies rather
than the adverse events [3]. Nonetheless, full reporting of
adverse events is of the utmost importance, as they provide
a fuller understanding of health care interventions, which
is crucial to informing medical practice, public health inter-
ventions, and health policy. Patients and providers need to
know about the relative benefits and harms of an interven-
tion. It is not just those adverse events deemed to be serious
that are important but also those categorized as minor. This
is particularly the case when different treatment options are
available, there is a narrow margin between the benefit and
harm, the adverse events are persistent, the treatment is pro-
phylactic, and the minor harms affect adherence. In many
cases, adverse events may be the deciding factor when more
than one treatment option is available.
Outcome reporting bias can be defined as ‘‘the selective
reporting of some outcomes but not others, depending on
the nature and direction of the results’’ [4].

 What is new?
Key finding
� Thirty-five percent of systematic reviews of health
care interventions changed, partially reported, or
excluded the adverse events outcome as specified
in
their
respective
PROSPERO-registered
protocols.
What this adds to what was known?
� This study examines the risk for adverse events re-
porting bias in systematic reviews using PROS-
PERO as a source of protocols and reviews.
� Only 38% of authors of systematic reviews include
an adverse events outcome at the stage of protocol
development. Sixty-five percent of the protocols
that do list adverse events outcomes report the out-
comes in the published review as they state they in-
tended to in the protocol.
What is the implication and what should change
now?
� Systematic reviews of health care interventions are
currently at high risk for adverse events reporting
bias.
� Researchers should be encouraged to include
adverse events outcomes in their protocol before
beginning a systematic review and follow harms
reporting guidelines.
Outcome reporting bias that specifically concerns harms
is referred to as adverse events reporting bias and is defined
as selective reporting of harms in reported or published
findings [1]. Outcome reporting bias in primary studies
can lead to an overestimation of treatment effects in sys-
tematic reviews [5], and poor adverse events reporting in
primary studies can compound in systematic reviews [6],
leading to an inaccurate picture of an intervention overall.
Despite the known risk of outcome reporting bias, little
research has examined the potential for adverse events re-
porting bias in systematic reviews. Previous research has
focused on the reporting within published reviews (with a
focus on Cochrane reviews) and has found the risk of re-
porting bias for adverse outcomes in these reviews to be
high [7], indicating a need to examine the potential for this
reporting bias from protocol to published review and
among other types of systematic reviews. The International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)
is an online database to publish protocols before the start
of a review to reduce the risk of reporting bias [8]. This
study is the first to examine adverse events reporting bias
using the PROSPERO database as a source of protocols
and their respective published reviews.
2. Methods
2.1. Protocol
A protocol detailing the research objectives and methods
was created before the start of this study. The protocol can be
found in the Supplementary Material. The initial protocol
was adapted from the study by Tricco et al. [9], who exam-
ined intended primary outcomes from protocols written in
advance compared with the reported primary outcomes in
published systematic reviews. They did not, however, look
at adverse events. We developed new methods to assess
adverse events reporting in systematic reviews.
2.2. Eligibility and inclusion process
All PROSPERO protocols with completed and published
reviews were screened and included if they (1) listed
adverse events as a primary or secondary outcome and
(2) included studies of health care interventions. When
browsing all these reviews, adverse events could have been
listed as adverse events, adverse effects, adverse reactions,
harms, side effects, toxicity, complications, unwanted/un-
desirable effects/outcomes, or safety. They could also have
been listed as specific outcomes known to be adverse events
of the intervention, such as bleeding events for anticoagula-
tion drug treatments. This approach is more rigorous than
searching with adverse events terms because of inconsistent
terminology and poor indexing used in the adverse event
literature. To examine the most up-to-date reporting prac-
tices of systematic reviews, only protocols with completed
reviews published in 2017 or 2018 were included.
All published systematic reviews of corresponding
included protocols were located using the publication infor-
mation listed on the PROSPERO database.
2.3. Data extraction
From the completed and published reviews, data were
collected on authors, author affiliations, year of publication,
title of review, number of studies, study designs, interven-
tion(s) of interest, primary outcomes reported, secondary
outcomes reported, main effect or result of the intervention,
and funding. The health care interventions under study in
each review were categorized by type. These categories
were drug, surgical, behavioral, screening/diagnostic, qual-
ity of care, multiple/any intervention (i.e., protocol indi-
cated an interest in multiple types of interventions or may
not have put any restrictions on included interventions),
and other (i.e., protocol indicated an interest in a single,
specific health care intervention that did not fall under
the other categories). The multiple/any category referred
to instances where more than one type of intervention
was included from more than one category. For example,
96
R. Parsons et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 108 (2019) 95e101
 a review may evaluate all interventions to treat a specific
disease, which may include drug, behavioral, and surgical
interventions.
2.4. Reporting codes
Each protocol-review pair was assigned a code regarding
their adverse events outcome reporting. Reviews that reported
all adverse events specified in their respective protocols were
coded as fully reported. Reviews with adverse events report-
ing discrepancies between the PROSPERO protocol and pub-
lished review were coded as either exclusion of adverse events
outcome or change in adverse events reported. Any reviews
coded as ‘‘change’’ were categorized further as a negative
change, positive change, or a change in presentation.
Negative change indicated that authors restricted their
reporting of the adverse events outcome or lowered the
outcome level to one of lesser importance. The two report-
ing codes used to indicate a negative change from protocol
to review were exclusion of specified adverse events in the
published review and moving adverse effect from a primary
outcome level in the protocol to a secondary outcome level
in the published review.
Positive change indicated that the authors chose to
broaden their reporting of the adverse events outcome or
raised the outcome level to one of a higher importance.
The two reporting codes used to indicate a positive change
from protocol to review were inclusion of additional spec-
ified adverse events in the published review and moving
adverse events from a secondary outcome level in the pro-
tocol to a primary outcome level in the published review.
Change in presentation indicated that the authors re-
ported their adverse events outcome but did so in a manner
that was different from the intentions described in their pro-
tocols (e.g., reporting as tolerability instead of safety and
reporting proportions instead of counts).
2.5. Efforts to reduce error
Protocol screening, data extraction, and assignment of
reporting codes were completed by the first author (R.P.)
and the second author (S.G.) independently. The third
author, I.W., settled any disagreements.
2.6. Contacting authors
In cases where the adverse events outcome from the pro-
tocol was excluded from the published systematic review,
the contact author of the review was emailed and asked
to clarify the reasons for the change in reporting.
2.7. Analysis
The codes given to the protocol and published review
pairs describing the adverse events reporting allowed for
the identification of discrepancies between the intended
adverse events outcomes from the protocols and the reported
adverse events outcomes from the reviews. From this, per-
mutations of the changes (e.g., exclusion of adverse events,
inclusion of new outcomes, a shift between primary and sec-
ondary outcome, etc.) were synthesized quantitatively.
3. Results
3.1. Systematic review cohort
From PROSPERO’s inception (February 2011) until the
search date March 29, 2018, there were 2,032 protocols with
a completed and published systematic review. Of these pro-
tocols, 1,376 focused on a health care intervention, such as a
drug or medical device. For protocols with an intervention,
524 (38%) listed adverse events as an outcome of interest.
Of those 524 protocols, 186 were for systematic reviews
published in 2017 or 2018. The 186 included protocols led
to 187 systematic reviews. We did not include 41 of 187
systematic reviews for the following reasons. Twenty-
three of the systematic reviews could not be accessed in a
full-text format, six were duplicate publications, one did
not focus on health care intervention studies, three used
the adverse events outcome as a measure of the interven-
tion’s effectiveness, seven were not systematic reviews,
and one was not published. After excluding these studies,
there were 146 systematic reviews in the final cohort (see
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Material: references for included
reviews and data extraction).
3.2. Reporting of adverse events outcomes
Of the 146 included systematic reviews, 95 (65%) fully
reported the adverse events outcome exactly as intended
from the protocol. Twelve (8%) of the reviews excluded
the adverse effect outcome entirely. The remaining 39
(27%) at least partially reported adverse events or in some
way changed the reporting of the outcomes (see Table 1).
There were 13 (9%) systematic reviews that changed the re-
porting of adverse events from the protocol in a positive way,
either by adding new specific named adverse events (5/146,
3%) or by moving the adverse events outcome from a second-
ary to a primary outcome (8/146, 6%). Seventeen (12%) of the
systematic reviews changed the adverse events reporting from
the protocol in a negative way, by excluding certain specific
named adverse events (10/146, 7%) or by moving the outcome
from a primary to a secondary outcome level (7/146, 5%).
Nine of the systematic reviews (7%) changed the report-
ing from the protocol in ways regarding the presentation of
the adverse events, meaning that although the outcome’s
data were reported fully, the manner in which the outcome
was reported differed in the published review. These
included changes such as presenting the outcome as ‘‘toler-
ability’’ instead of ‘‘safety,’’ reporting on proportions
instead of counts, excluding prespecified analyses, report-
ing only adverse events of specific grades (e.g., adverse
events of grade 3 or 4) instead of all adverse events, not dis-
cussing the number of adverse events leading to drop-out as
97
R. Parsons et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 108 (2019) 95e101
 intended and instead reporting only the number of adverse
events, not specifically identifying the adverse events
outcome as a primary or secondary outcome but still fully
reporting the outcome data or failing to name specific
named adverse events and instead reporting under an um-
brella term such as ‘‘complications.’’
3.3. Adverse events reporting by intervention type
The percentage of the 1,376 protocols listing an adverse
events outcome was recorded by intervention type (Fig. 2).
The intervention types most likely to have an adverse
events outcome listed in the protocol were drugs (275/
452), surgical (93/181), and any/multiple (40/88). Those
intervention types less likely to list adverse events out-
comes in the protocol were screening/diagnostic (26/78),
other (41/142), quality of care (14/110), and (35/327)
behavioral (Fig. 2).
The level of adverse events reporting was examined
across health care intervention types (see Table 2). System-
atic reviews with a focus on screening/diagnostic interven-
tion studies were the most likely to fully report the adverse
events outcome although there were only four reviews in
this category. Systematic reviews of drug intervention
studies were the second most likely to fully report the
outcome, followed by surgical, other, behavioral, and any/

studies fully reported the adverse events outcome. The sin-
gle review interested in placebo as an intervention changed
the presentation of its adverse events outcome.
The categories of drug, behavioral, quality of care, and
any/multiple health care interventions included systematic
reviews that excluded the adverse events outcome.
3.4. Adverse events reporting by funding source
The reporting of adverse events was recorded in relation
to the funding source (public sector, industry, or not re-
ported; Table 3). Those reviews, which had public sector
funding, such as university or government health depart-
ment (such as the Department of Health in the United
Kingdom), reported the adverse events mentioned in the
protocol in 80% of the corresponding published reviews
as opposed to 63% or 64% of industry-funded reviews
and reviews with funding not reported respectively. And
none of the public sectorefunded reviews excluded adverse
events in the published review as opposed to 6% and 11%
of the other reviews. Interestingly 20% of industry-funded
reviews had positive changes as opposed to 13% and 3%
of public sectorefunded reviews and reviews with funding
not reported. However, caution should be exercised as the
number of reviews reporting their funding source was less
than half (46%, 44/95) making any generalizations difficult.

The number and percentage of systematic reviews for each health care intervention type that fell into the different codes for AEs reporting.
As with Table 1, for the subcategories for positive change and negative change (inclusion or exclusion or specific AEs and changing the outcome
level), the number of reviews in the two subcategories total to equal the number included for the main positive/negative change category.
The percentages all reflect the number of reviews per reporting code out of the total number of reviews per intervention type.

 protocol, 109 (81%) reported the adverse events within the
main text of the published systematic review. The remain-
ing 25 reviews (19%) did not report the adverse events in
the main text, choosing to report them in Supplementary
Tables or Appendices.
3.6. Contact authors’ responses
Of the 12 authors who were contacted, four responded.
The first replied that the adverse events outcome referred
to ‘‘any unfavorable treatment outcomes,’’ in this case un-
favorable tuberculosis treatment outcomes, which were
related to the efficacy of treatment and not to adverse
events as defined in this research study. Two authors stated
that no adverse events had occurred in the primary studies,
and one of the two also stated that there was no discussion
of nonoccurrence in the systematic review because of the
word limit enforced by the publishing journal. The final
contact author replied that there were no eligible primary
studies that included an adverse events outcome.
4. Discussion
The results of this study are consistent with past findings
that systematic reviews are at risk of outcome reporting bias
and discrepant outcome reporting [2e4,7,9,10]. Just more
than one-third of protocols for systematic reviews of health
care interventions listed adverse events as an outcome of inter-
est on PROSPERO (either as a primary or secondary
outcome). All interventions that can have an effect have the
potential to have an adverse effect. It is, however, more widely
accepted that drug interventions and possibly surgical inter-
ventions have the potential to have adverse events or compli-
cations. This is reflected in the percentage of protocols with
adverse events outcomesd61% of drug intervention protocols
and 51% of surgical procedure protocols. These percentages
are still low considering the importance of adverse events.
Adverse events are potentially the most dangerous outcomes
following a health intervention, and the lack of protocols indi-
cating adverse events as an outcome of interest should be of
great concern to anyone looking at systematic reviews as ev-
idence of harms for any intervention. By actively excluding
adverse events, systematic reviews may be biased and not
helpful when it comes to informing balanced health care de-
cision-making.
The majority of systematic reviews in this cohort fully
reported (65%) or partially reported (27%) the harm
outcome in the published review, whereas only a handful
excluded the outcome (8%). It appears that although few
protocols specify an adverse events outcome, those that
do are quite likely to at least partially, if not fully, report
the adverse outcomes in their published review.
Overall, there were discrepancies between protocol and
publication in the adverse outcomes reported in 35% of our
included reviews. This result is consistent with those observed
in previous studies. A methodological review, which focused
on effectiveness outcomes rather than harm outcomes, found
discrepancies in outcome reporting in 38% of Cochrane re-
views [10]. The study by Tricco et al. of effectiveness out-
comes in non-Cochrane reviews found that 32% of reviews
had a discrepancy between protocol and publication [9].
The reasons authors provided for excluding the adverse
events outcome highlight two implications. The first point that
researchers may believe that the absence of adverse events in
primary studies does not warrant discussion within a system-
atic review although the absence of adverse events is just as
clinically significant as their presence when it comes to assess-
ing the safety of an intervention. The second is that the term
adverse events may not be universally understood, a fact that
has been demonstrated previously [11]. A researcher’s under-
standing of the term ‘‘adverse’’ will influence the way he or
she identifies and discusses harm outcomes.
Future research into adverse events reporting bias should
focus on systematic reviews that are non-Cochrane and do
not have a protocol published on PROSPERO, as these
kinds of reviews have yet to be studied in this context,
and there is some evidence that non-Cochrane reviews are
at greater risk of adverse events reporting bias [12]. Look-
ing to other kinds of systematic reviews will provide a
greater understanding of the potential for adverse events re-
porting bias across all types of reviews and may help to
inform better guidelines for harms reporting in systematic
reviews. Further research could also evaluate the reasons
why review authors often fail to include adverse events out-
comes in their protocols and why discrepancies exist be-
tween protocols and full systematic reviews. This could
help inform guidance and training for reviewers.
In the meantime, researchers seeking to complete a sys-
tematic review of a health care intervention should be
educated on the importance of the inclusion of adverse
events outcomes. Just as certain journals have endorsed
the use of various reporting guidelines in the past, journals
that publish systematic reviews should consider encour-
aging authors to include harms outcomes and endorse
harms reporting guidelines, such as the PRISMA harms
checklist [6,13]. This will lead to a reduction in the risk

 for adverse events reporting bias and improve the quality of
harms reporting. Techniques such as reporting guidelines
endorsement have improved reporting quality of health
research articles in the past [14,15] and could be a viable
solution for improving reporting of harms.
5. Conclusions
Sixty-two percent of review authors did not mention
adverse effect outcomes in their protocol. This is of
concern, given the importance of adverse events in
decision-making for patients and policymakers.
Also, of concern, 35% of the cohort of PROSPERO-
registered systematic reviews were at risk of adverse
events reporting bias from the protocol to publication
stage of the review process. This figure may also be high-
er for reviews, which do not publish their protocols in
PROSPERO.
The findings suggest a need for the encouraged inclusion
of harms outcomes in systematic reviews and the use of
harms reporting guidelines.
