Summary
Background Based on previous findings, we hypothesised that radiotherapy to the prostate would improve overall 
survival in men with metastatic prostate cancer, and that the benefit would be greatest in patients with a low metastatic 
burden. We aimed to compare standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer, with and without radiotherapy.
Methods We did a randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 117 hospitals in Switzerland and the UK. Eligible patients 
had newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer. We randomly allocated patients open-label in a 1:1 ratio to standard 
of care (control group) or standard of care and radiotherapy (radiotherapy group). Randomisation was stratified by 
hospital, age at randomisation, nodal involvement, WHO performance status, planned androgen deprivation therapy, 
planned docetaxel use (from December, 2015), and regular aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. 
Standard of care was lifelong androgen deprivation therapy, with up-front docetaxel permitted from December, 2015. 
Men allocated radiotherapy received either a daily (55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks) or weekly (36 Gy in six fractions 
over 6 weeks) schedule that was nominated before randomisation. The primary outcome was overall survival, 
measured as the number of deaths; this analysis had 90% power with a one-sided α of 2·5% for a hazard ratio (HR) 
of 0·75. Secondary outcomes were failure-free survival, progression-free survival, metastatic progression-free survival, 
prostate cancer-specific survival, and symptomatic local event-free survival. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards 
and flexible parametric models, adjusted for stratification factors. The primary outcome analysis was by intention to 
treat. Two prespecified subgroup analyses tested the effects of prostate radiotherapy by baseline metastatic burden 
and radiotherapy schedule. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00268476.
Findings Between Jan 22, 2013, and Sept 2, 2016, 2061 men underwent randomisation, 1029 were allocated the control 
and 1032 radiotherapy. Allocated groups were balanced, with a median age of 68 years (IQR 63–73) and median 
amount of prostate-specific antigen of 97 ng/mL (33–315). 367 (18%) patients received early docetaxel. 1082 (52%) 
participants nominated the daily radiotherapy schedule before randomisation and 979 (48%) the weekly schedule. 
819 (40%) men had a low metastatic burden, 1120 (54%) had a high metastatic burden, and the metastatic burden was 
unknown for 122 (6%). Radiotherapy improved failure-free survival (HR 0·76, 95% CI 0·68–0·84; p<0·0001) but not 
overall survival (0·92, 0·80–1·06; p=0·266). Radiotherapy was well tolerated, with 48 (5%) adverse events (Radiation 
Therapy Oncology Group grade 3–4) reported during radiotherapy and 37 (4%) after radiotherapy. The proportion 
reporting at least one severe adverse event (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or worse) was 
similar by treatment group in the safety population (398 [38%] with control and 380 [39%] with radiotherapy).
Interpretation Radiotherapy to the prostate did not improve overall survival for unselected patients with newly 
diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer.

Introduction
Patients with metastatic cancer typically receive systemic 
treatment, with local therapy reserved—if required—for 
symptom palliation. However, local treatment to the 
primary tumour might be more useful than previously 
appreciated. In animal models of cancer, primary 
tumours metastasise not merely by disseminating 
tumour cells into the circulation but also by priming the

premetastatic niche.1 Proliferation of tumour cells at 
distant sites to form overt metastases is dependent on 
compounds secreted by the primary tumour into the 
circulation.2 In these models, local treatment of the 
primary tumour inhibits not just the initiation of distant 
disease but also the progression of existing metastases.
Radical local treatment of the primary tumour has been 
tested in several randomised controlled trials in patients 
with metastatic cancer. Cytoreductive nephrectomy 
improved survival in patients with metastatic renal carcin­
oma,3,4 but this benefit was not confirmed in a more 
recent trial in patients with advanced disease.5 Radio­
therapy to the primary tumour has not been shown to 
improve survival in patients with metastatic small­cell 
lung cancer6 or metastatic breast cancer,7 but these trials 
were relatively small and might not have detected a 
modest, but worthwhile, benefit.
In men with metastatic prostate cancer, retrospective 
analyses have noted an association between use of 
radiotherapy to the primary tumour and improved overall 
survival.8–11 The survival benefit associated with prostate 
radiotherapy was reported to be greater in patients with a 
better prognosis.8,9,11 The HORRAD trial randomised 
432 men with metastatic prostate cancer to androgen 
deprivation therapy with or without prostate radiotherapy 
and found no evidence of an overall survival benefit 
(hazard ratio [HR] 0·90, 95% CI 0·70–1·14) but raised 
the possibility that survival might be improved in a 
subgroup of patients with fewer than five bone metastases 
(0·68, 0·42–1·10).12
We hypothesised that radical radiotherapy to the 
prostate would improve overall survival in men 
presenting with metastatic prostate cancer and that the 
survival benefit would be greatest in men with a low 
metastatic burden.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 
117 hospitals in Switzerland and the UK. Eligible patients 
had prostate cancer that was newly diagnosed, with no 
previous radical treatment, and had metastatic disease 
confirmed on a bone scintigraphic scan and soft­tissue 
imaging done within 12 weeks of starting androgen 
deprivation therapy. All patients were intended for long­
term androgen deprivation therapy and started treatment 
no earlier than 12 weeks before randomisation. There 
were no age restrictions; patients were required to have 
no contra 
indications to radiotherapy and no clinically 
significant cardiovascular history.
This trial was done in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki and 
had relevant regulatory and ethics approvals. All patients 
gave written informed consent. The rationale and design 
have been described previously.13 Full details are in the 
protocol.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomised centrally using a computerised 
algorithm, which was developed and maintained by the 
Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical Trials Unit at 
University College London. Minimisation with a random 
element of 20% was used, stratifying for hospital, age at 
randomisation (<70 years vs ≥70 years), nodal involve­
ment (negative vs positive vs indeterminate), WHO 
perfor 
m 
ance status (0 vs 1 or 2), planned androgen 
deprivation therapy, and regular aspirin or non­steroidal 
anti­inflammatory drug use (yes or no). Planned doce­
taxel use was added as a stratification factor on 
Dec 17, 2015. Allocation was 1:1 to either standard of 
care (control) or standard of care and radiotherapy

Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE (1966–2018), Embase (1982–2018), 
trial registers (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and 
ClinicalTrials.gov), and major urology and oncology conference 
proceedings (1990–2018) to retrieve randomised controlled 
trials of radiotherapy in metastatic prostate cancer. The search 
strategy included a range of terms to identify randomised 
controlled trials, prostate cancer, and radiotherapy. 
One relevant trial—HORRAD—was identified (n=432, 
270 deaths) in which no evidence was reported of an overall 
survival benefit for prostate radiotherapy (hazard ratio 
[HR] 0·90, 95% CI 0·70–1·14), but a hypothesis was generated 
that survival might be improved in a subgroup of patients with 
low metastatic burden (HR 0·68, 95% CI 0·42–1·10).
Added value of this study
To the best of our knowledge, our large randomised trial 
(n=2061, 761 deaths) provides the best available evidence 
about the role of prostate radiotherapy in metastatic prostate 
cancer. Our findings showed no overall survival benefit of 
radiotherapy to the prostate in men with newly diagnosed 
prostate cancer. However, a subgroup analysis supported the 
hypothesis of HORRAD, that prostate radiotherapy improves 
survival in men with low metastatic burden.
Implications of all the available evidence
Evidence suggests that prostate radiotherapy improves 
overall survival for men with metastatic prostate cancer who 
have a low metastatic burden, but not for unselected 
patients. Prostate radiotherapy should be a standard 
treatment option for men with newly diagnosed disease with 
a low metastatic burden.

(radiotherapy). Patients and clinical and study staff were 
aware of the treatment allocation for practical reasons, 
and the key efficacy outcome measures were objective.
Procedures
All patients received lifelong androgen deprivation therapy 
as either gonadotrophin­releasing hormone agonists or 
antagonists or orchidectomy. Docetaxel was permitted 
in addition to hormone therapy after its approval in the 
UK on Dec 17, 2015. Docetaxel, when used, was given 
as six 3­weekly cycles of 75 mg/m², with or without 
prednisolone 10 mg daily.
External­beam radiotherapy to the prostate was given 
as one of two schedules nominated before randomisation: 
either 36 Gy in six consecutive weekly fractions of 6 Gy, 
or 55 Gy in 20 daily fractions of 2·75 Gy over 4 weeks. 
Radiotherapy was given with the patient supine and with 
a full bladder and an empty rectum. The planning target 
volume consisted of the prostate only, with an 8 mm 
margin posteriorly and a 10 mm margin elsewhere. 
Radiotherapy was to commence as soon as practicable 
after randomisation, and within 3–4 weeks after the last 
docetaxel dose.
Patients were followed up every 6 weeks until 6 months 
after randomisation, then every 12 weeks to 2 years, then 
every 6 months to 5 years, then annually there 
after. 
Prostate­specific antigen (PSA) levels were measured at 
every follow­up visit; further tests were at the clinician’s 
discretion. Nadir PSA was the lowest level of PSA 
reported within 24 weeks after randomisation. Toxic 
effects and symptoms were reported at regular follow­
up visits or when an adverse event was categorised as 
serious. Adverse events were graded with the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Adverse effects 
on the bowel and bladder during radiotherapy, and 
possible long­term effects of radiotherapy, were recorded 
separately in patients assigned standard of care and 
radiotherapy using the Radiation Therapy Oncology 
Group (RTOG) scale.14

Metastatic burden at randomisation was assessed 
through whole­body scintigraphy and CT or MRI staging 
scans. Scans were centralised and reviewed by one of us 
(AA), with 10% independent review by a radiologist (HD). 
The metastatic burden was classified according to the 
definition used in the CHAARTED trial:15 high metastatic 
burden was defined as four or more bone metastases with 
one or more outside the vertebral bodies or pelvis, or 
visceral metastases, or both; all other assessable patients 
were considered to have low meta 
static burden.
Outcomes
The primary efficacy outcome was overall survival, 
defined as time from randomisation to death from any 
cause. Failure­free survival was the primary activity 
outcome measure for interim analyses and was defined 
as time from randomisation to first evidence of at least 
one of: biochemical failure; progression either locally, in 
lymph nodes, or in distant metastases; or death from 
prostate cancer. Biochemical failure was based on a rise 
above the lowest PSA value reported within 24 weeks 
after enrolment of 50% and to at least 4 ng/mL; patients 
without a fall of 50% were considered to have bio­
chemical failure at time zero. Secondary outcomes 
were progression­free survival (defined as failure­free 
survival but without biochemical events) and metastatic 
progression­free survival (defined as time from ran­
domisation to new metastases or pro 
gression of existing 
metastases or death). Cause of death was determined by 
the site investigator, with some causes reclassified as 
prostate cancer according to predefined criteria that 
indicated prostate cancer to be the likely cause. Symptom­
atic local events were defined as any of the following: 
urinary­tract infection, new urinary catheterisa 
tion, acute 
kidney injury, tran 
surethral resection of the prostate, 
urinary­tract obstruction, ureteric stent, neph 
rostomy, 
colostomy, and surgery for bowel obstruction. Patients 
without the event of interest were censored at the time 
last known to be event­free.

cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy (STAMPEDE) multi­
arm multistage (MAMS) platform protocol (appendix p 6). 
It was designed with a seamless phase 2/3 approach.16 The 
sample size was calculated using nstage and its pre 
decessor 
programs in Stata, which enable design of MAMS trials.17 
Assuming, for the control group, a median failure­free 
survival of roughly 1 year and median survival of about 
3·5 years, we targeted a 25% relative improvement 
(HR 0·75) in both failure­free survival and overall survival 
for the group allocated radiotherapy to the prostate over the 
control group.
For the efficacy stage analysis of the pairwise com­
parison of standard of care and radiotherapy versus 
standard of care for overall survival, approximately 
267 deaths in patients allocated to the control group were 
needed for 90% power and a one­sided α of 2·5%, 
accounting for three intermediate analyses of failure­
free survival (analysed June, 2014, November, 2014, and 
May, 2015). For this comparison, the pairwise and family­
wise error rates were judged very similar, because of the 
limited overlap in events with other reported comparisons 
from the protocol and the non­binding nature of the 
interim analyses.
The initial sample size target was 1250 patients. During 
the trial, weekly and daily radiotherapy schedules were 
nominated approximately equally. Therefore, the sample 
size was increased to roughly 1800, without reference to 
outcome data, to provide good power for failure­free 
survival in each radiotherapy schedule­defined subgroup 
when the comparison reached its target power overall, 
assuming that the effect of radiotherapy would be 
the same regardless of schedule. We predicted about 
300 failure­free survival events in the control group on 
each schedule at the time of the main analysis, which 
would provide approximately 90% power with a one­
sided α of 0·015 to detect an HR of 0·75. The effect of 
radiotherapy on survival within a nominated radiotherapy 
schedule would be investigated if there was both an effect 
on failure­free survival and 200 or more deaths in the 
control group were reported for that nominated schedule.
In May, 2018, based on accumulating external data and 
without reference to any data from this comparison in 
STAMPEDE, we prespecified that any effect from radio­
therapy would be greatest in patients with a low baseline 
metastatic burden and that this hypothesis could be tested 
with reasonable power, regardless of interaction test 
results. If roughly 40% of patients had a low metastatic 
burden, we anticipated more than 90% power for failure­
free survival (HR 0·70) if median failure­free survival were 
24 months in the control group and about 60% power for 
overall survival (HR 0·70) if median survival were roughly 
6 years. If about 60% of patients had a high metastatic 
burden, we anticipated the subgroup analysis would have 
roughly 88% power for failure­free survival (HR 0·80) if 
median failure­free survival were 12 months in the control 
group and about 63% power for overall survival (HR 0·80) 
if median survival were 4 years.
Standard survival analysis methods were used to 
analyse time­to­event data in Stata version 15. A non­
parametric stratified log­rank test was used to detect a 
difference in survival between treatment groups; this 
analysis was stratified across the minimisation factors 
used at randomisation (except hospital and planned 
androgen deprivation therapy) plus protocol­specific 
periods defined by other arms recruiting to STAMPEDE 
or changes to standard of care that could affect the 
population being randomised. Cox proportional hazards 
regression models adjusting for the same stratification 
factors and stratified by time were used to estimate

to the data; these are more reliable than reading the 
Kaplan­Meier curves; graphs show estimated survival 
over time from both. The proportional hazards assump­
tion was tested; restricted mean survival time was 
emphasised in the presence of non­proportionality, using 
a t­star of 59 months as determined by the Royston and 
Parmar method.18 Cause­specific and Fine and Gray 
regression models19 were used for competing risk analysis 
of prostate cancer­specific, lymph node, and meta 
static 
progression­free and symptomatic local event­free 
survival. All tests are presented as two­sided, with 
95% CIs and relevant p values.
Subgroup analyses were prespecified for the nominated 
radiotherapy schedule (daily vs weekly) and for baseline 
metastatic burden (low vs high), when determinable. 
Exploratory interaction analyses considered the con­
sistency of treatment effect within stratification factors, 
by time, by Gleason score, and by PSA before hormone 
therapy.
Median follow­up was ascertained by reverse­censoring 
on death. All patients were included in the primary 
efficacy analysis according to allocated treatment, and the 
analysis was done on an intention­to­treat basis. Adverse 
event data are shown for the safety population, which 
consisted of patients with at least one follow­up 
assessment analysed according to the treatment approach 
started; patients were excluded if they had no adverse 
event data. A sensitivity analysis was done on an intention­
to­treat basis. Data for symptomatic local events are also 
presented. All other analyses are exploratory.
Accumulating interim data were reviewed by an 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee, guided by 
lack­of­benefit stopping guidelines.
This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number 
NCT00268476) and ISRCTN.com (ISRCTN78818544).

(control group, n=1029) or standard of care and radio­
therapy (radiotherapy group, n=1032; figure 1). Groups 
were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics 
(table 1). Median age was 68 years (IQR 63–73) and 
median PSA before androgen deprivation therapy was 
97 ng/mL (33–315). 1630 (79%) patients had a Gleason 
score of 8–10. 1836 (89%) had bone metastases. 1466 (71%) 
had a WHO performance status of zero. Baseline 
characteristics of 1939 (94%) patients in whom metastatic 
disease burden could be determined are shown in the 
appendix (p 1).
Standard hormone therapy was luteinising hormone­
releasing hormone analogues for 2046 (99%) men. 
Standard of care included docetaxel for 367 (18%) patients. 
Of 2061 patients undergoing random assignment, 
roughly half were nominated for each radiotherapy 
schedule, with 979 (48%) nominating the weekly schedule 
and 1082 (52%) the daily schedule. Of 968 patients 
assigned radiotherapy who started radio 
therapy within 
1 year after randomisation, 906 received their planned 
schedule and 62 received the alternative or another 
schedule. Two patients assigned radiotherapy received 
their planned schedule later than 1 year after ran­
domisation, and 62 did not receive radiotherapy at all 
(mainly because of patient’s choice). In patients who 
started radiotherapy, median time to starting radio 
therapy 
was 35 days (IQR 28–60) after randomisation, and 95 days 
(74–120) from starting hormone therapy (most patients 
started androgen deprivation therapy before random 
is­
ation; appendix p 2). Only 20 (2%) patients allocated to 
the control group received radiotherapy within 1 year of 
randomisation.
Median follow­up was 37 months (IQR 24–48). 
391 patients assigned to the control group died (median 
survival 46 months [IQR 27–not reached]; 3­year survival 
62%). Compared with controls, no survival advantage 
was noted with radiotherapy (stratified log­rank test 
p=0·451; HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·80–1·06; p=0·266), with 
370 deaths in the radiotherapy group (median survival 
48 months [IQR 27–not reached]; 3­year survival 65%; 
figure 2A; table 2). There was no evidence of non­
proportional hazards.
Figure 3 shows prespecified and exploratory subgroup 
analyses. In the analysis by metastatic burden, overall 
survival was improved in patients with low metastatic 
burden at baseline who were allocated radiotherapy 
(HR 0·68, 95% CI 0·52–0·90; p=0·007; 3­year survival 
73% with control vs 81% with radiotherapy; table 2), 
with no evidence of non­proportional hazards. We 
found some evidence of heterogeneity of treat 
ment effect 
by metastatic burden (interaction p=0·0098; figure 4). 
In patients with a high metastatic burden, there was 
no evidence of a treatment effect (HR 1·07, 95% CI 
0·90–1·28; p=0·420). The appendix (p 7) shows further 
exploratory consistency­of­effect analyses.
758 failure­free survival events were reported in patients 
assigned to the control group, largely driven by rising 
PSA (appendix p 3); median failure­free survival was 
13 months (IQR 6–33) and 3­year failure­free survival 
was 23%. In patients assigned to the radio 
therapy group, 
685 failure­free survival events were reported, with 
median failure­free survival of 17 months (IQR 8–53) and 
3­year failure­free survival of 32%. Overall, failure­free 
survival was improved with radiotherapy (HR 0·76, 
95% CI 0·68–0·84; p<0·0001; figure 2B). There was 
some evidence of non­proportional hazards (p=0·066).

failure­free survival, restricted to the first 59 months 
on trial, was 21·4 months in the control group, 
compared with 26·2 months with radiotherapy (difference 
4·8 months, 95% CI 2·8–6·7; p<0·0001; table 2).
In the prespecified subgroup analysis by metastatic 
burden, failure­free survival was improved in patients 
with low metastatic burden at baseline who were allocated 
radiotherapy (HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·49–0·72; p<0·0001; 
table 2). Evidence of a differential treatment effect from 
radiotherapy compared with the high metastatic burden 
subgroup was also noted (interaction p=0·002; HR 0·88, 
95% CI 0·77–1·01; p=0·059; figure 4). The appendix (p 8) 
shows prespecified and exploratory consistency­of­effect 
analyses.
643 (84%) of 761 deaths were attributed to prostate 
cancer (329 [84%] of 391 in the control group and 
314 [85%] of 370 in the radiotherapy group). Adjusted 
competing risks regression for prostate cancer­specific 
survival using the Fine and Gray method provided no 
evidence of an overall treatment effect (sub­HR 0·94, 
95% CI 0·81–1·10; robust p=0·431; table 2). There was 
evidence of an effect in patients with low metastatic 
burden (sub­HR 0·65, 95% CI 0·47–0·90; robust 
p=0·010), but no evidence of a treatment effect was noted 
in patients with high metastatic burden (1·11, 0·92–1·33; 
robust p=0·279). A significant interaction was seen 
between treatment effect and metastatic burden (robustly 
estimated interaction p=0·007).
The appendix (pp 9, 10) shows the analysis of 
progression­free survival for all patients and by baseline 
metastatic burden. A treatment effect was only noted in 
patients with a low metastatic burden (HR 0·78, 95% CI 
0·63–0·98; p=0·033; table 2).
One or more symptomatic local events were reported by 
432 (42%) of 1029 patients allocated to the control group 
compared with 450 (44%) of 1032 patients assigned to the 
radiotherapy group. There was no evidence of a difference 
in time to first symptomatic local event by treatment 
allocation (HR 1·07, 95% CI 0·93–1·22; p=0·349; table 2). 
Table 3 shows the number of patients reporting each type 
of symptomatic local event at least once.
There was some evidence of heterogeneity in the 
effect on failure­free survival by nominated radiotherapy 
schedule (interaction p=0·072; appendix p 8). Prespecified

analyses in 1082 patients who nominated the daily 
schedule before randomisation (55 Gy in 20 fractions over 
4 weeks) found strong evidence of a failure­free survival 
advantage with radiotherapy compared with control 
(HR 0·69, 95% CI 0·59–0·80; p<0·0001). Among these 
1082 patients, 212 deaths were reported in the control 
group and 188 in the radiotherapy group (stratified log­
rank p=0·123; HR 0·86, 95% CI 0·71–1·05; p=0·128). 
There was insufficient evidence of a difference in failure­
free survival in 979 patients who nominated the weekly 
radiotherapy schedule (36 Gy in six fractions over 6 weeks; 
HR 0·85, 95% CI 0·73–0·99; p=0·033) to report on 
survival.
Adverse effects on the RTOG scale during radiotherapy 
were modest, with 48 (5%) of 920 patients allocated 
radiotherapy who started radiotherapy and who com­
pleted at least one acute toxicity form reporting grade 3 
or 4 adverse events; 43 (5%) patients reported their worst 
acute bladder toxic effect as grade 3 or 4, and eight (1%) 
reported their worst acute bowel toxic effect as grade 3 
or 4 (table 4; appendix p 11); no grade 5 toxic effects were 
reported. The incidence of acute bladder and bowel 
effects (grade 1–4) was lower for those who nominated 
the weekly radiotherapy sche 
dule than for those who 
nominated the daily schedule (282 [65%] bladder and 
206 [47%] bowel vs 341 [71%] bladder and 297 [62%] 
bowel). Patients in both control and radiotherapy groups 
reported a low incidence of grade 3 and 4 RTOG late 
effects (one [1%] control vs 37 [4%] radiotherapy; table 5).
The proportion of patients in the safety population 
reporting at least one severe adverse event of CTCAE 
grade 3 or worse was similar in both study groups and 
was dominated by side­effects associated with long­term 
hormone therapy (398 [38%] of 1050 in the control group 
and 380 [39%] of 985 in the radiotherapy group; appendix 
pp 4, 12); with no evidence of a difference in time to first 
grade 3 or worse event (HR 1·01, 95% CI 0·87–1·16; 
p=0·941). In 2028 patients with adverse event data at 
approximately 6 months, the proportions reporting a 
grade 3 or worse adverse event were similar (225 [21%] of 
1047 in the control group and 212 [22%] of 981 in the 
radiotherapy group). Of 1125 patients with adverse event 
data at 1 year, 63 (12%) of 531 patients in the control group 
and 78 (13%) of 594 in the radio 
therapy group reported a 
grade 3 or worse adverse event. At 2 years, of 533 patients 
with data available, 37 (15%) of 240 in the control group 
and 37 (13%) of 293 in the radiotherapy group reported a 
grade 3 or worse event. The pattern and levels of adverse 
events were very similar when considering the intention­
to­treat popu 
lation (data not shown). No deaths were 
reported as related to the research treatment.

difference in time to any therapy, but an indication that

Discussion
This randomised comparison of more than 2000 pat­
ients with metastatic prostate cancer showed that local 
radiotherapy to the prostate did not improve overall 
survival for unselected patients. However, a prespecified 
analysis showed that prostate radiotherapy did improve 
overall survival (from 73% to 81% at 3 years) in those 
with a low metastatic burden, which represented 40% of 
the comparison population.
Our subgroup finding meets all criteria proposed by 
Sun and colleagues to assess credibility of subgroup 
effects:20 low metastatic burden status was deter­
mined from scans taken before randomisation; the 
hypothesis—including the direction of the effect—was 
specified a priori; only a few hypothesised subgroup 
effects were tested; the interaction test suggested a low 
likelihood that the apparent subgroup effect could be 
accounted for by chance; the subgroup effect was 
independent of other assessed variables; the size of the 
subgroup effect was large (HR 0·68 for low metastatic 
burden and HR 1·07 high metastatic burden); and the 
interaction was consistent both with other related 
outcome measures in STAMPEDE (eg, failure­free 
survival) and with the interaction reported on number 
of bone metastases in the HORRAD trial12 (less than five 
bone metastases, HR 0·68; five or more bone meta­
stases, HR 1·06). It also seems plausible that the effect 
of local radio 
therapy would be diminished in patients 
with a greater burden of metastatic disease. There is, 
therefore, good reason to accept that prostate radio­
therapy improves survival of men with a low metastatic 
burden and that it should now be a standard treatment. 
Unlike many other new interventions for metastatic 
cancer, prostate radiotherapy does not require regulatory 
approval and is readily available at modest cost in most 
parts of the world.
When this comparison was designed, the standard 
radical radiotherapy dose schedule for localised prostate 
cancer was 74 Gy in 37 fractions over 7·5 weeks. It was 
felt that this schedule would be too burdensome for 
patients with metastatic disease, and the two more 
convenient schedules permitted in the trial were chosen 
based on a survey of investigators’ opinions. The trial has 
proven the principle that local radiotherapy can improve 
survival, but the optimum dose schedule and technique 
are uncertain. Radical radiotherapy for localised prostate 
cancer is now typically given to a dose of 60 Gy in 
20 fractions over 4 weeks.21 With contemporary tech­
niques for target delineation and treatment delivery, this 
schedule is well tolerated21 and might be expected to be at 
least as effective as the two schedules tested in the trial.
It is well known that prostate radiotherapy improves 
survival for men with locally advanced (T3–4 N0 M0) 
prostate cancer.22 We have now found that prostate 
radiotherapy also improves survival for men with a 
low metastatic burden (Tany Nany M1) prostate cancer. It 
therefore seems safe to conclude that radiotherapy would 
also improve survival for men with pelvic node­positive 
prostate cancer (Tany N1 M0). This is important, because it 
is not feasible to do randomised trials specifically in men 
with non­metastatic node­positive prostate cancer and 
because such men often receive systemic treatment 
alone. In the current study, roughly 60% of patients were 
N1 in both the high and low metastatic burden subgroups. 
The benefit we have shown for prostate radiotherapy 
in prostate cancer with a low metastatic burden also 
raises another question: would there be further benefit 
from additional radiotherapy to the oligometastases 
themselves?
Low metastatic burden disease is sometimes known as 
oligometastatic. Although this term is widely used, it is 
imprecise and potentially misleading because it implies 
only a small number of metastases. Patients with low 
metastatic burden disease, according to the CHAARTED 
definition, may have an unlimited number of metastases 
provided they are confined to lymph nodes and the axial 
skeleton. 
Our data have several strengths to note. This is a large 
randomised dataset with broad engagement from more 
than 100 hospitals across Switzerland and the UK. 
By incorporating the comparison into the established 
STAMPEDE protocol, following peer­review and protocol 
amendment, we recruited to an enlarged target well 
ahead of schedule (2061 patients in 3·5 years rather than 
1250 patients in 4 years).
Our data also have some limitations. First, the possible 
clinical relevance of metastatic burden in patients with 
prostate cancer only became widely apparent when the 
CHAARTED trial reported.15 We determined metastatic

burden by retrospectively collecting retrievable baseline 
scans. This was possible in most (94%) but not all 
patients. Second, compliance with allocation to prostate 
radiotherapy was not complete (94%) and this could 
underestimate the true effect size for radiotherapy. Third, 
median follow­up (37 months) is shorter than median 
survival (46 months); this could be particularly relevant to 
the analysis of symptomatic local events, which can occur 
late and after disease progression. We plan to continue 
follow­up and to link to routinely collected electronic 
health records to capture symptom 
atic local events. Our 
current analysis indicates that radiotherapy does not 
improve survival for patients with a high metastatic 
burden. Future analyses will explore whether prostate 
radiotherapy might still be useful in such patients for 
prevention of symptomatic local events. Fourth, up­front 
systemic treatment of meta 
static prostate cancer has 
evolved. Most patients in this comparison received 
androgen deprivation alone. Doce 
taxel was permitted in 
addition to hormone therapy after its approval in the 
UK15,23,24 and was used, therefore, mostly in recently 
randomised patients who had the shortest follow­up. 
Although only roughly one in six patients received 
docetaxel in this comparison, there is no evidence to 
suggest that prostate radiotherapy is more or less effective 
when docetaxel is given in addition to androgen 
deprivation therapy. More recently, abiraterone has 
become another option in this setting.25–28 The value of 
prostate radiotherapy in men receiving abiraterone is 
being tested in the PEACE1 trial (NCT01957436),29 and the 
prospectively planned STOPCAP M1 meta­analysis of 
these trials will explore this further.30
We have tested local treatment to the prostate using 
radiotherapy. It is possible that other forms of local 
treatment—such as radical prostatectomy—might also 
be effective. If the benefit of radiotherapy is mediated by 
local tumour eradication, one would expect surgery to be 
at least as effective. However, radiotherapy might be 
effective via other mechanisms (eg, immune modu­
lation), so the role of surgery in men with metastatic 
prostate cancer remains unproven. The feasibility of 
prostate surgery in this setting is being tested in the 
g­RAMMP trial (NCT02454543) and the TROMBONE 
feasibility study.31
There is uncertainty regarding the optimum defini 
tion 
of low metastatic burden (oligometastatic) prostate 
cancer. We used the same definition as that in the 
CHAARTED trial, but this is not necessarily the optimum 
definition. Our findings were almost identical when 
applying a variant of the definition used in the LATITUDE 
trial;25 absence of visceral metastases and fewer than 
three bone metastases (data not shown). Exploratory 
analyses of a broader cohort of patients in the STAMPEDE 
study will inform the definition of oligometastatic 
disease, with the aim of refining patients’ selection for 
prostate radiotherapy. All current definitions are based 
on conventional imaging using CT and bone scans. 
Caution will be required in extrapolating these results to 
patients imaged with more sensitive techniques (eg, 
PSMA PET). For example, patients with low meta 
static 
burden on conventional imaging should not be denied 
prostate radiotherapy because they have additional 
lesions identified on a PET scan.
In summary, radiotherapy to the prostate did not 
improve survival for unselected patients with newly 
diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, but, in a pre­
specified subgroup analysis, overall survival did improve 
in men with a low metastatic burden. Therefore, 
prostate radiotherapy should be a standard treatment 
option for men with a low metastatic burden. These 
findings also raise the possibility that local treatment to 
the primary tumour should be explored for patients 
with small­volume metastatic disease from other 
malignant diseases.
