IMPORTANCE Depressive severity is typically measured according to total scores on
questionnaires that include a diverse range of symptoms despite convincing evidence that
depression is not a unitary construct. When evaluated according to aggregate measurements,
treatment efficacy is generally modest and differences in efficacy between antidepressant
therapies are small.
OBJECTIVES To determine the efficacy of antidepressant treatments on empirically defined
groups of symptoms and examine the replicability of these groups.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patient-reported data on patients with depression from
the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial (n = 4039) were
used to identify clusters of symptoms in a depressive symptom checklist. The findings were
then replicated using the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes
(CO-MED) trial (n = 640). Mixed-effects regression analysis was then performed to
determine whether observed symptom clusters have differential response trajectories using
intent-to-treat data from both trials (n = 4706) along with 7 additional placebo and
active-comparator phase 3 trials of duloxetine (n = 2515). Finally, outcomes for each cluster
were estimated separately using machine-learning approaches. The study was conducted
from October 28, 2014, to May 19, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Twelve items from the self-reported Quick Inventory of
Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) scale and 14 items from the clinician-rated Hamilton
Depression (HAM-D) rating scale. Higher scores on the measures indicate greater severity of
the symptoms.
RESULTS Of the 4706 patients included in the first analysis, 1722 (36.6%) were male; mean
(SD) age was 41.2 (13.3) years. Of the 2515 patients included in the second analysis, 855
(34.0%) were male; mean age was 42.65 (12.17) years. Three symptom clusters in the
QIDS-SR scale were identified at baseline in STAR*D. This 3-cluster solution was replicated in
CO-MED and was similar for the HAM-D scale. Antidepressants in general (8 of 9 treatments)
were more effective for core emotional symptoms than for sleep or atypical symptoms.
Differences in efficacy between drugs were often greater than the difference in efficacy
between treatments and placebo. For example, high-dose duloxetine outperformed
escitalopram in treating core emotional symptoms (effect size, 2.3 HAM-D points during 8
weeks, 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.1; P < .001), but escitalopram was not significantly different from
placebo (effect size, 0.03 HAM-D points; 95% CI, −0.7 to 0.8; P = .94).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Two common checklists used to measure depressive severity
can produce statistically reliable clusters of symptoms. These clusters differ in their
responsiveness to treatment both within and across different antidepressant medications.
Selecting the best drug for a given cluster may have a bigger benefit than that gained by use
of an active compound vs a placebo.

eta-analyses1andfactoranalyticstudiesoflargepopu-

Heterogeneity among depressive symptoms may im-
pede the evaluation of treatments for depression.11,12 For ex-
ample, treatment efficacy for one group of symptoms may be
masked by a lack of efficacy for other symptoms, potentially
explaining mixed results from large comparative efficacy
meta-analyses.4,13 For example, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors are generally effective in reducing low mood14 rela-
tive to other symptoms. However, evaluating outcomes on an
individual symptom level may be cumbersome since clini-
cians would need to remember treatment guidelines specific
toeachsymptom.Althoughsymptomsmightbegroupedbased
on clinical experience (eg, “melancholic depression”)15 or
the use of rating subscales (eg, Hamilton Rating Scale for
Depression–7), novel associations might be overlooked by this
process.
Statistical methods enable one to categorize depressive
symptoms into subcomponents. For example, one study
showed that nortriptyline hydrochloride is more effective than
escitalopram in treating a neurovegetative symptom dimen-
sion,butescitalopramwasmoreeffectiveintreatingmoodand
cognitive symptom dimensions.16 However, traditional sta-
tistical approaches have some shortcomings. Factor analy-
ses, for example, may generate complicated combinations of
symptoms within particular dimensions.16 These analyses also
may be susceptible to experimenter bias since one often has
to choose the desired number of clusters or components in the
data, as in k means clustering.17 By contrast, hierarchical clus-
tering is an easy-to-visualize, deterministic method in which
each symptom is assigned to a single cluster (ie, not loading
across multiple clusters) without prespecifying the desired the
number of clusters.
In this study, we explored the efficacy and predictability
ofantidepressanttherapiesintreatingspecificgroupsofsymp-
toms (eMethods [which includes eTables 1-10 of various analy-
ses] and eFigure 1 in the Supplement). We used an unsuper-
vised machine-learning approach (hierarchical clustering) to
establish a data-driven grouping of baseline symptoms. The
clustering method was applied to patients from a large mul-
tisite trial of depression and a replication sample from an in-
dependent clinical trial with similar inclusion criteria. Next,
we reanalyzed treatment outcomes for 9 archival clinical trials
(Table 1) according to the severity of each symptom cluster
(rather than total severity) to determine whether symptom
clusters are equally responsive to antidepressant treatments
and whether certain drugs and doses are more effective than
others. Finally, we used supervised machine learning to pre-
dict outcomes specific to each cluster of symptoms since there

symptoms that do not correlate strongly with changes in other
features of depression.
Methods
Clinical Trial Data
The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depres-
sion (STAR*D) trial is the largest prospective, randomized clini-
cal trial of outpatients with major depressive disorder.18-21 Eli-
gible participants were treatment-seeking outpatients with a
primary clinical (DSM-IV) diagnosis of nonpsychotic major de-
pressive disorder scored 14 or higher on the 17-item Hamilton
Depression (HAM-D) rating scale, were aged 18 to 75 years, and
were recruited from primary and psychiatric care settings in
the United States from June 2001 to April 2004.19 We focused
on the first treatment stage consisting of a 12-week course of
citalopram hydrobromide. The present study was conducted
from October 28, 2014, to May 19, 2016. It was approved by
the Yale University Human Subjects Committee, with a waiver
of informed consent.
The Combining Medications to Enhance Depression
Outcomes (CO-MED) trial was a multisite, single-blind, ran-
domized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of medication
combinations in the treatment of unipolar major depressive
disorder.22,23 Eligible patients were aged 18 to 75 years, had a
primary DSM-IV–based diagnosis of nonpsychotic major
depressive disorder, had recurrent or chronic depression
(current episode ≥2 years), scored 16 or higher on the 17-item
HAM-D rating scale, and enrolled participants between
March 2008 and February 2009. Patients were randomly
allocated (1:1:1) to escitalopram plus placebo (monotherapy),
escitalopram plus bupropion hydrochloride, or venlafaxine
hydrochloride plus mirtazapine.
We also analyzed all arms from 7 randomized, multicenter,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active comparator-
controlled clinical trials of duloxetine for major depressive
disorder (Table 1). Four different protocols were used for these
Key Points
Question Are antidepressants equally good at treating different
kinds of symptoms in depression?
Findings Individual patient data from 9 clinical trials of major
depression in 7221 patients were analyzed, with a focus on specific
clusters of symptoms rather than total depressive severity. For
each cluster, significant differences in efficacy between
antidepressants were identified.
Meaning Antidepressant medications can be selected to benefit
specific clusters of symptoms in depression.

studies; parts A and B reflect trials run in parallel following
the same protocol. All studies incorporated double-
blind, variable-duration placebo lead-in periods. Safety and
efficacy results from these studies have been published
previously24-27 and summarized as pooled analyses of
safety28 and efficacy.29 Study HMCR is registered at
clinicaltrials.gov.30 The other studies were conducted before
clinical trial registration was necessary.
Outcomes for STAR*D and CO-MED are based on the
16-item self-report Quick Inventory of Depressive Symp-
tomatology (QIDS-SR) checklist during 12 weeks of treat-
ment. Outcomes for all other trials are based on the 17-item
HAM-D rating scale31 during 8 weeks. We excluded the
HAM-D “loss of insight” item because there is no equivalent
in the QIDS-SR and excluded weight/appetite items because
they were not collected in the same way across trials and are
often excluded from item-level analyses32 (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). Study selection was driven primarily by
access to individual patient-level data. Patients provided
informed consent to treatment when they participated in
the original clinical trials. Consent was not needed for the
present analyses since the data were deidentified. Of the
4706 patients included in the first analysis, 1722 (36.6%)
were male; mean (SD) age was 41.2 (13.3) years. Of the 2515
patients included in the second analysis, 855 (34.0%) were
male; mean age was 42.65 (12.17) years.
Symptom Clustering
Rating scales in depression include a diverse range of symp-
toms. We applied a data-driven approach to identify groups
of symptoms within depression rating scales. Higher scores on
the rating scales indicate more severe symptoms. Hierarchi-
cal clustering shows structure in data without making assump-
tions about the number of clusters that are present in the data
and gives a deterministic solution. We applied agglomerative
(bottom-up) hierarchical clustering to the QIDS-SR checklist
completed at baseline in STAR*D by 4017 patients and repli-
cated the analysis using baseline QIDS-SR data from CO-MED
(n = 640) and the baseline HAM-D scale that was also col-
lectedon4039patientsinSTAR*D.Weconductedmultiplesen-

Evaluation of Treatment Outcomes
Treatment Efficacy
We analyzed the full intent-to-treat samples in all trials using
linear mixed-effects regression models (STAR*D, 4041; CO-
MED, 665; and other trials, 2515). The dependent measure was
mean within-cluster severity: for each patient at each time
point, we calculated the mean symptom severity within each
cluster. Fixed effects included symptom cluster, time (log-
transformed weeks), treatment regimen, and all 2- and 3-way
interaction effects. We included a separate random intercept
and slope for each symptom cluster with unstructured vari-
ance-covariance of the random effects within subject based on
improvementsintheSchwarz-Bayesianinformationcriterion.33
False-discovery rate-adjusted34 P values were used to deter-
mine statistical significance for post hoc comparisons by clus-
ter and drug within each mixed-model analysis.
One model was used to analyze QIDS-SR–based clusters
across STAR*D and CO-MED, and another model was used to
analyze HAM-D–based clusters for the 7 other placebo-
controlled trials. In the HAM-D model, we also included the
main effect of the trial to control for potential systematic dif-
ferences among trials. Preliminary analyses of the 4 dulox-
etine doses in each cluster indicated that 120-mg/d and 80-
mg/d dosages were not significantly different from each other
but differed from the lower doses and placebo (eResults and
eFigure 10 in the Supplement). The 60-mg/d and 40-mg/d du-
loxetine dosages were similar to each other and nearly indis-
tinguishable from placebo. We therefore grouped cohorts into
high-dose duloxetine (80-120 mg/d) and low-dose dulox-
etine (40-60 mg/d).
Outcome Predictability
We used a recently developed statistical modeling pipeline8 to
predict treatment outcomes specific to each symptom cluster
usinginformationavailableatbaseline.Weextracted164items,
includingdemographics,medicalandpsychiatrichistories,and
specific symptom items that were used as predictor variables
(eTable10intheSupplement).Penalizedlogisticregression(elas-
tic net35,36) was then used to identify the 25 variables that best
predicted each cluster separately. These variables were then
used to train machine-learning algorithms (gradient boosting
machines37,38), resulting in a separate model for each symp-
tomcluster,witheachusing25predictorvariables.Predictabil-
ity was measured as the percentage of variance explained in
final cluster scores (ie, R2) using 5 repeats of 10-fold cross-
validation. The statistical significance of each model was as-
sessed using a permutation test (eMethods in the Supple-
ment). We trained models on patients with complete baseline
data for whom a severity score was recorded after 12 or more
weeksoftreatment(n = 1962)toensureadequatetreatmentdu-
ration. To externally validate our predictive models, they were
applied without modification to predict final cluster scores in
CO-MEDtreatmentcompleters.Here,statisticalsignificancewas
measured by a P value calculated for Pearson correlations be-
tweenpredictedoutcomesandobservedoutcomesineachtreat-
ment group of CO-MED. We did not have comparable predic-
tor data in the duloxetine trials; thus, predictive analyses were
conductedonlyforSTAR*DandCO-MED.Forsignificance,per-
mutation-based tests used an α level of .01, mixed-effects re-
gressions used a false-discovery rate correction and then an α
level of .05, and Pearson correlations used an α level of .05.
Predictive and clustering analyses were implemented in
R, version 3.2.3 (R Foundation). Efficacy analyses were con-
ducted using SAS, version 9.4 (proc mixed) (SAS Institute).
Results
In 2 independent trials, we identified the same clustering of
symptoms in the QIDS-SR checklist, consisting of core emo-
tional,sleep(insomnia),andatypicalsymptoms(Figure1Aand
B). A similar clustering solution was also found for the HAM-D
scale checklist (Figure 1C). The clustering solution was robust
across a number of sensitivity analyses using different para-
meters, time points, and approaches (eFigures 3-9 and eTables
1-3 in the Supplement).
Efficacy Analyses
Treatment efficacy was measured according to the rate of
symptom improvement over time (ie, steeper symptom tra-
jectories are better, as shown in Figure 2). No antidepressant
treatment worked equally well across all 3 symptom clusters.
As shown in Figure 2A, when measured according to the QIDS-
SR, trajectories were significantly better for core emotional
symptoms than for either sleep symptoms or atypical symp-
toms for citalopram, escitalopram with placebo, and escita-
lopram with bupropion (all β>0.079; all false-discovery rate
corrected P < .001). Sleep trajectories were also better than
atypical trajectories for these 3 treatments (all β>0.099; all
P ≤ .001). As shown in Figure 2B, when measured according
to the HAM-D rating scale, a similar pattern was observed. Core
emotional trajectories were better than sleep and atypical
trajectories for all treatments (all β>0.12; all P ≤ .001). Sleep
trajectories were also better than atypical trajectories for low-
dose duloxetine and escitalopram (all β>0.080; all P ≤ .001).
All slope contrast estimates, SEs, 95% CIs, and P values are
included in eTables 4 and 5 in the Supplement.
To interpret the magnitude of differences between drugs,
we calculated an effect size (ES), measured in raw rating scale
points, that reflects the difference between treatments in re-
ducing the overall severity of a symptom cluster (ie, we mul-
tiplied slope contrasts by the natural log of treatment dura-
tion and then by the number of symptoms in each cluster). For
example, in this study, high-dose duloxetine was signifi-
cantly better than escitalopram in treating atypical symp-
toms, such that a patient’
s total improvement in atypical
severity was a mean of 1.9 HAM-D points greater with high-
dose duloxetine than escitalopram (ES, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3;
false-discovery rate corrected P < .001).
For each symptom cluster, there were significant differ-
ences in efficacy between treatments (Figure 2). Combined
escitalopram and bupropion treatment was significantly more
effective in treating core emotional symptoms than citalo-
pram (ES, 0.7 QIDS-SR points; 95% CI, 0.2 to 1.3; P = .03). For
sleep/insomnia symptoms, venlafaxine with mirtazapine out-
performed citalopram (ES, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.8; P < .001). For

core emotional symptoms in HAM-D scale trials (Figure 2B),
high-dose duloxetine outperformed escitalopram (ES, 2.3
HAM-D points; 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.1; P < .001). Escitalopram was
not significantly different from placebo for core emotional
symptoms (ES, 0.03 HAM-D points; 95% CI, −0.7 to 0.8;
P = .94). For sleep symptoms, high-dose duloxetine outper-
formed fluoxetine (ES, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.7; P = .046). For
atypicalsymptoms,high-doseduloxetineoutperformedalloth-
ers (ES, 0.5-1.9) and escitalopram was worse than placebo (ES,
0.7; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.1; P = .002). Among our HAM-D studies,
only 2 antidepressant treatments (high-dose duloxetine and
paroxetine) outperformed placebo for all 3 symptom clus-
ters. All other comparisons are presented in eTables 6 and 7
in the Supplement.
Predictive Analyses
Within STAR*D, although all models performed significantly
above chance (all P < .01), we observed substantial variability
in the predictability of outcomes for each cluster (Table 2 and
eTable 8 in the Supplement). The sleep symptom cluster was
the most predictable (R2 = 19.6%; SD, 5.0%; P < .01) and sub-
stantially more predictable than core symptoms (R2 = 14.5%;
SD,4.6%;P < .01)andatypicalsymptoms(R2 = 15.1%;SD,5.3%;
P < .01). The observed range in cluster predictability (R2
difference, 5.1%) was also significantly larger than any range
observed during permutation testing (mean [SD] range, 0.56%
[0.50%]; P < .01). We inspected the best predictive baseline
variables for each model separately, highlighting those iden-
tified as predictive for 1 cluster but not others (ie, specific pre-
dictors) (Table 2). Baseline HAM-D scale severity was a top pre-
dictor of core emotional outcomes but not any of the other 3
clusters. Baseline atypical symptom severity and hypersom-
nia predicted atypical outcomes; baseline sleep cluster sever-
ity and early-morning insomnia predicted sleep outcomes.
We then applied the best-performing models, without
modification,topredictoutcomesforeachclusterinthe3treat-
ment groups of CO-MED (Figure 3). Performance was statisti-
cally above chance, although clinically modest, for predict-
ingcoreemotionaloutcomesintheescitaloprammonotherapy
arm (r149 = 0.18; P = .03) and the venlafaxine-mirtazapine arm
(r138 = 0.17; P = .04). Performance was above chance predict-
ing sleep outcomes in the escitalopram-bupropion arm
(r132 = 0.36; P < .001).
Clinical Decision Support Tool
To help translate these findings into clinical practice, we based
a clinical decision support tool on these findings. It is imple-
mented as a brief questionnaire that can be accessed from any
web browser and returns results in real time (https://www
.spring.care/spring-assessment).
Discussion
Using a data-driven approach, we identified 3 symptom clus-
ters within the QIDS-SR checklist. We replicated our cluster-
ingsolutioninanindependenttrialcohort(CO-MED)andfound
it to be robust across different parameters and time points and
consistent with other statistical approaches. No antidepres-
sant was equally effective for all 3 symptom clusters, and, for
each symptom cluster, there were significant differences in
treatment efficacy between drugs. Antidepressants in gen-
eral worked best in treating core emotional and sleep symp-
tomsandwerelesseffectiveintreatingatypicalsymptoms.The
magnitude of these differences suggests that selecting the best
drug for a given cluster may have a bigger benefit than that

This procedure sequentially groups symptoms according to the similarity of
their responses across a patient cohort. With this procedure, groups of
symptoms that merge at high values relative to the merge points of their
subgroups are considered candidates for natural clusters. A and B, In the Quick
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self Report (QIDS-SR) checklist, we
identified an identical 3-cluster solution in both the Sequenced Treatment
Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) (n = 4017) and Combining
Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes (CO-MED) trials (n = 640).
C, A comparable symptom structure was also observed at baseline for STAR*D
patients when measured according to the Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) rating
scale. The names of the individual checklist items are colored according to their
cluster assignment. Line lengths in the dendogram reflect how similar items or
clusters are to one another (shorter line length indicates greater similarity).

appeartoresponddifferentiallytoantidepressantmedications.
Symptom clusters may also enable drug testing in smaller but
more informative populations with a more consistent pheno-
type. This approach is consistent with the National Institute of
Mental Health Research Domain Criteria40—symptom clusters
ordimensionsmighthavedistinctiveunderlyingneuralcircuitry
and signaling mechanisms—and paves the way for developing
treatments that target and biomarkers that predict changes in
specific clusters of symptoms.

symptom groupings relative to previous approaches.
For instance, our emotional cluster resembled the HRSD-7

subscale but never included a suicide item, and when scored
according to the HAM-D scale, the HRSD-7 energy/
fatigabilityitemclusteredwithinsomniasymptomsratherthan
emotional symptoms. There were slight differences between
the QIDS-SR and HAM-D scale results. In the HAM-D scale, the
emotional cluster included an anxiety item, whereas in the
QIDS-SR scale, the same cluster included low energy and con-
centration. The energy/concentration item falls in the sleep
cluster for the HAM-D scale. This data-driven approach may
have identified a set of symptoms in the emotional presenta-
tion of depression that may have neural circuit correlates that
are more cohesive than either the DSM criteria or theory-
driven clusters, such as the Bech/Maier scales, which have not
yet produced meaningful signatures on neural circuits or treat-
mentresponseprediction.10,43Finally,theatypicalclustercon-
tains items that are not considered atypical items in the DSM,
so conclusions about broader atypical symptoms should not
be drawn from the naming of this cluster.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, there was a high de-
gree of study heterogeneity. Two rating scales (clinician-
rated HAM-D vs self-rated QIDS-SR) and treatment durations
(8 vs 12 weeks) were used. The studies used a mixture of fixed-
and variable-dosage protocols and had differences in blind-
ing (STAR*D was unblinded, CO-MED was single-blind, and all
other trials were double-blind). The consistency of these find-
ingsfrom7000patientsfromtheseheterogeneousstudiessug-
gests that the findings should generalize. However, study dif-
ferences precluded direct comparisons using all available data,
and study selection based on data availability may be a source
of bias.44 Our inclusion of placebo-controlled duloxetine trials
was critical for considering the pattern of cluster response tra-
jectoriesforplaceboanddeterminingwhethertrajectorieswere
better with drug treatment than placebo. Ideally, behavioral
interventions might be focused on atypical symptoms that are
generally less responsive to antidepressants or combined with
otherfocusedinterventionsforspecific/residualsymptoms(eg,
modafinil for energy/fatigue, zolpidem for insomnia). Fi-
nally, group-level differences do not translate to individual pa-
tient differences in a simple manner45; therefore, further re-
search is needed to test whether the web tool is accurate and
effective in real-world practice.
Larger limitations surround the interpretation of current
predictive analyses (eTable 9, eFigure 11, and eDiscussion in
the Supplement). Generalizability of our original pipeline was
poor. Alternative analytic strategies may be more effective
(eFigure 10 in the Supplement). This limitation highlights the
importanceofexternallyvalidatingpredictivetoolsratherthan
relying on metrics based on the discovery sample.8 Because
it is impractical for each model to require 25 different items,
we must identify a more limited group of predictor variables
to use cluster-specific tools in the clinic.
Conclusions
Clusters of symptoms are detectable in 2 common depres-
sion rating scales, and these symptom clusters vary in their re-
sponsivenesstodifferentantidepressanttreatments.Thesepat-
terns may offer clinicians evidence for tailoring antidepressant
selection according to the symptoms that a specific patient is
experiencing immediately—almost doubling the expected ef-
fect size of a treatment.

For each symptom cluster, a new model was trained on patients who received
citalopram in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression
(STAR*D) trial (A). After cross-validation, we applied the models to patients in 3
treatment arms of the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression
Outcomes (CO-MED) trial (B) to test their ability to generalize to an
independent clinical trial sample. Core emotional symptoms could be predicted
with significantly above-chance performance in the escitalopram with placebo
and venlafaxine with mirtazapine arms. Sleep/insomnia symptoms could be
predicted above chance for escitalopram with bupropion.
