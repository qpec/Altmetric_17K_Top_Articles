Objectives To use a musculoskeletal model of the 
lower limb to evaluate the effect of a strength training 
intervention on the muscle and joint contact forces 
experienced by untrained women during landing.
Methods Sixteen untrained women between 18 and 
28 years participated in this cohort study, split equally 
between intervention and control groups. The intervention 
group trained for 8 weeks targeting improvements in 
posterior leg strength. The mechanics of bilateral and 
unilateral drop landings from a 30 cm platform were 
recorded preintervention and postintervention, as was the 
isometric strength of the lower limb during a hip extension 
test. The internal muscle and joint contact forces were 
calculated using FreeBody, a musculoskeletal model.
results The strength of the intervention group increased 
by an average of 35% (P<0.05; pre: 133±36 n, post: 
180±39 n), whereas the control group showed no change 
(pre: 152±36 n, post: 157±46 n). There were only small 
changes from pre-test to post-test in the kinematics 
and ground reaction forces during landing that were not 
statistically significant. Both groups exhibited a post-test 
increase in gluteal muscle force during landing and a 
lateral to medial shift in tibiofemoral joint loading in both 
landings. However, the magnitude of the increase in gluteal 
force and lateral to medial shift was significantly greater in 
the intervention group.
Conclusion Strength training can promote a lateral to 
medial shift in tibiofemoral force (mediated by an increase 
in gluteal force) that is consistent with a reduction in 
valgus loading. This in turn could help prevent injuries that 
are due to abnormal knee loading such as anterior cruciate 
ligament ruptures, patellar dislocation and patellofemoral 
pain.
InTrOduCTIOn
Abnormal knee joint loading has been shown 
to be a mechanism of injury in a range of 
complaints including anterior cruciate liga-
ment (ACL) rupture, patellar dislocation 
and patellofemoral pain.1–4 Consequently, 
there has been great interest in finding ways 
to modify internal joint loading in order to 
prevent these injuries. However, the outcome 
measures of such studies have generally been 
the calculation of external kinematics and 
kinetics or intersegmental mechanics (ie, joint 
angles, intersegmental forces and moments 
calculated by inverse dynamics analysis, or 
ground reaction forces; GRF5–7). Although 
useful, these calculations do not indicate the 
actual loading experienced by the internal 
structures of the knee (ie, the forces experi-
enced by muscle–tendon units, ligaments and 
bones). For instance, ACL injury prevention 
programmes have been shown to successfully 
modify kinematic outcomes towards move-
ment strategies of lower risk,7 8 and there is 
epidemiological evidence that such interven-
tions effectively reduce the ACL injury rate9–11; 
however, the effect of such programmes on 
the actual internal joint loading is largely 
unknown.
Muscle strength and activation are vari-
ables that can be directly changed by training 
programmes12 and can provide protection 
against injury in activities like landing from 
a jump. For instance, previous ACL injury 
research has described the importance of 
gluteal and hamstring strength13 14 and 
increased hamstring activation pre-landing 
and post-landing15 in reducing injury. Simi-
larly, gluteal activation and strength have 
been related to a reduction of knee valgus,16 
patellofemoral pain17 18 and patellar dislo-
cation19 in various activities. Despite these 
positive associations, however, the literature 
relating to the effect of strength training 
alone on kinematics and GRF during move-
ment is equivocal20 21 and the effect on 
internal knee joint forces is again unknown. 
To this end, this study employed a posterior 
Key messages
 
► Strength training of the lower limb resulted in a 
lateral to medial shift of tibiofemoral forces during 
drop landing.
 
► This appeared to be mediated by an increased force 
in the gluteal musculature during landing.
 
► Musculoskeletal modelling of the lower limb can 
demonstrate changes in lower limb mechanics 
during drop landing that have not been reported 
using traditional methods.

lower limb-focused training intervention, which would 
be expected to increase the strength of the gluteal and 
hamstring musculature.
One technique that can be used to estimate internal 
forces is musculoskeletal modelling, and musculoskeletal 
modellers envisage a future where their work can inform 
clinical practice.22 23 For instance, there have been a 
number of studies that have sought to quantify the forces 
present in the knee during landing.24–29 However, no 
study has used musculoskeletal modelling technology to 
assess the effect of a posterior thigh musculature-focused 
training intervention on the forces experienced by the 
internal structures of the knee. The objective of this study 
was therefore to evaluate the effects of a leg strength 
training intervention on internal knee forces during 
landing (tibiofemoral joint reaction forces; TF) using 
a publicly available musculoskeletal model of the lower 
limb.30 We hypothesised that the intervention would 
result in a lateral to medial shift in TF that is consistent 
with the changes in landing mechanics that have previ-
ously been seen after strength training.21 31
MeThOds
experimental approach
This study was divided into three phases undertaken at 
St Mary’s University. First, during the pre-test, the perfor-
mance of the participants in a landing task was assessed 
alongside a measure of their posterior lower limb 
strength. Next, the experimental group took part in an 
8-week training intervention designed to increase their 
posterior lower limb strength whereas the control group 
kept up with their usual recreational activities. Finally, all 
participants were retested using the same protocol as in 
the pre-test. The experimenters were not blinded as to 
the participant groups.
Participants
Sixteen young, healthy students participated in this 
study (table 1) and were assigned to either the control 
group (CG) or intervention group (IG) based on their 
availability to take part in the intervention training 
programme. The recruitment criteria stipulated that the 
participants were women, between 18 and 28 years of age, 
free from musculoskeletal injuries over the preceding 6 
months, right foot dominant and only took part in recre-
ational physical activity (ie, no heavy resistance or injury 
prevention training for at least 6 months prior to the 
study, and that they participated in mainly leisure sports 
at most four times per week). All participants provided 
informed written consent prior to the experiment, and 
the ethics subcommittee of St Mary’s University approved 
the study.
Instrumentation
Evaluation of drop-landing performance
The kinematics describing the time history of the posi-
tion of 18 reflective markers (14 mm) placed on key 
anatomical landmarks of the right leg and pelvis30 
according to the guidelines of Van Sint Jan32 33 was 
obtained using a Vicon 3D motion analysis system (Vicon 
MX System; Vicon Motion Systems, UK) incorporating 11 
cameras. The GRFs during landing were measured with 
a force plate (Kistler 9287BA Plate; Kistler Instruments, 
UK) synchronised with the Vicon system. All data were 
collected at 200 Hz.
Lower limb strength testing
The strength of the posterior aspect of the lower limb was 
tested in a closed kinetic chain task as described below 
using the same Kistler force plate as for the evaluation of 
the drop landings.
Procedures
After performing a 10 min supervised, dynamic warm-up 
including running, high knees, buttock kicks, lunges, 
squats, straight leg walks and hop and stick, the partici-
pants practised the drop landings for up to five attempts 
both bilaterally and unilaterally. A 3 to 5 min rest followed, 
in which the reflective markers were placed on the 
anatomical landmarks with double-sided adhesive tape. 
Drop-landing data were collected during controlled falls 
from a 30 cm platform placed 0.5 cm in front of the force 
plate. Participants first completed five bilateral landings 
(BLs) and then five unilateral landings (ULs) having 
been instructed to step forward from the platform with 
their dominant right foot (and not to jump forwards or 
step down), land naturally with only their dominant foot 
touching the force plate and stay in this landing position 
for at least 2 s. During BLs, the participants were asked 
to land with both feet at the same time (figure 1A—note 
the position of the feet with just the dominant foot on the 
force plate). Incorrect landings contrary to the descrip-
tion above were repeated. The rest periods between the 
five drop landings for each condition were at least 60 s 
long, and at least 2 min rest was taken between the BLs 
and ULs.
After a 3 to 5 min rest period, the strength of the right 
posterior thigh was assessed in a hip extension test. The 
hip was positioned at a flexion angle of 30° (note in this 
article we use the convention that when the subject is 
stood in the anatomical position, their ankle, knee and 
hip joint angles are 0°, and that flexion of the joint is 
represented by a positive angle). The ankle was positioned 
neutrally (ie, at a flexion angle of 0°) with the heel at the 
centre of a wooden block that was on top of the force 
plate (figure 1B). The participants were then encouraged 
to push the heel downwards with maximum force for a

period of at least 6 s and the peak force was recorded. 
A 2 min rest period was taken between the three trials. 
This hip extension test was chosen as it has previously 
been shown to be reliable34 and tests the strength of the 
limb in a closed kinetic chain task at similar joint angles 
to those found at initial contact during BL in women.35 36
Exercise intervention
Eight participants performed an 8-week posterior leg 
strength programme (table 2), attending 3 hourly 
sessions per week that were supervised by a UK Strength 
and Conditioning Association qualified coach. Loading 
was progressed weekly by increasing the load lifted based 
on individual responses to training (strength, experience 
and motivation), but sets, reps, rest and perceived exer-
tion were similar within the group.
data analysis
Musculoskeletal model
In order to compare predicted muscle and joint reaction 
forces preintervention and postintervention, the data 
collected were analysed using a publicly available muscu-
loskeletal model of the lower limb30 37–40 (FreeBody; www. 
msksoftware. 
org. 
uk). The validation and verification of 
FreeBody has been described previously,41–44 with a focus 
on the accuracy of the TF predictions41 and the sensitivity 
of the model to the input kinematic data and its muscle 
force upper bounds.43
FreeBody represents the lower limb as a linked chain of 
five rigid segments. The position and orientation of the

pelvis, thigh, calf and foot segments at each moment in 
time are determined from the marker data (the position 
of each segment has 3 df and its orientation has a further 
3 df). The position and orientation of the patella segment 
is determined based on the knee flexion angle,30 using 
relationships developed from previous literature.45 46 The 
anthropometry of each segment is determined from the 
work of de Leva.47 Given the time history of the position 
and orientation of each segment and its anthropometry, 
the kinematics of each segment is calculated using the 
method of Dumas and colleagues.48 Next, the data of 
Klein Horsman and colleagues49 are used to determine 
the origins, insertions and lines of actions of 163 muscle 
elements and 14 ligaments.
Following the above steps, the equations of motion 
governing the movement of the segments can be deter-
mined (online supplementary equation 1). However, 
there are more unknown forces (193) than there are in 
the online supplementary equation 2, and thus this is an 
indeterminate problem with many possible solutions. 
The next step is therefore to pick the most physiologically 
likely solution. First, the potential solution set is narrowed 
by imposing physiologically based constraints then the 
most physiologically likely solution is determined by 
using an optimisation procedure developed37 from the 
work of Crowninshield and Brand50 and Raikova51 that 
is implemented using MATLAB (R2013a; Mathworks, 
Natick, MA, USA). The optimisation is predicated on 
finding the solution that minimises a cost function based 
on maximising muscular endurance (online supplemen-
tary equation 2).
Data processing
For each subject, each landing (BL, UL) and both 
pre-tests and post-tests, the trial that resulted in the 
lowest peak GRF was selected for analysis (as this was 
taken to be the most successful landing). A fourth-order 
dual low-pass Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency 
of 6 Hz was used to filter the kinematic and kinetic data. 
The filtered data were then processed through FreeBody. 
The strength capabilities of FreeBody (as represented by 
the maximum force that each muscle and ligament was 
permitted to experience) were scaled to reflect the partic-
ipants’ strength testing results. Following the example of 
our previous work, if the optimisation routine employed 
by FreeBody (fmincon routine in MATLAB) could not 
find a feasible solution for a particular frame, then we 
raised the strength upper bound for the frame until a 
solution could be found. This was only necessary for a 
limited number of frames.
statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statis-
tics (V.22; International Business Machines, Armonk, NY, 
USA) and MATLAB (R2013a; Mathworks). ANOVA was 
used to check for differences in age or anthropometry 
between the groups at pre-test. An ANCOVA was used 
to evaluate the change in strength of the right posterior 
thigh musculature where baseline strength was included 
as a covariate. The alpha level was set at P<0.05 a priori 
and normality was confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk tests.
The output data from the musculoskeletal model were 
first normalised with regards to time. A cubic spline was 
then fitted to each data series and used to interpolate 
the normalised curves to obtain values at regular inter-
vals. The mean and the 95% CI at each time point was 
then calculated for each data series. A significant differ-
ence between curves was determined when there was no 
overlap between the CIs.
resulTs
During the intervention, the strength of the IG increased 
by 35% (figure 2; P=0.001; pre: 133±36 n, post: 180±39 n). 
There was no change in the strength of the CG (pre: 
152±36 n, post: 157±46 n). The participants attended 
94% of the planned sessions.

Both CG and IG exhibited an increased use of the 
gluteal musculature from pre-test to post-test (figure 3). 
However, the magnitude of the increase was greater for 
the IG in both BLs and ULs, and there was also little 
overlap of CIs (whereas for the CG it was considerable). 
There were no other strong trends in terms of changes 
in muscle forces from pre-test to post-test (online supple-
mentary material).
During the pre-test, the peak lateral tibiofemoral joint 
contact force (lateral TF) was greater than the peak 
medial tibiofemoral joint contact force (medial TF) for 
all groups (figure 4). For the CG, the lateral TF then 
dropped below the medial TF after the first local peak 
in GRF during both landings. For the IG BL, the lateral 
TF dropped below the medial TF after the second local 
peak in GRF, whereas for the IG UL, the lateral TF was 
greater than the medial TF throughout the analysed time 
period. During the post-test, the lateral TF fell relative 
to the medial TF for all groups; however, the magnitude 
of this change was greater for the IG than the CG, and 
greater for the UL than the BL. For the IG, the lateral TF 
was equal to or lower than the medial TF throughout the 
time period for both landings.
There were only minor differences between the prein-
tervention and postintervention GRFs for both landing 
styles and groups (online supplementary material). There 
was a trend towards slightly higher peak GRFs postinter-
vention during the BLs for both groups (approximately 
0.3–0.4× body weight; BW). In addition, the GRF for the 
CG UL was marginally lower during the post-test (around 
0.2–0.3× BW for most of the time during the landing 
period). This study was largely unable to demonstrate 
changes in kinematics between the pre-test and post-
test, although both groups showed a trend towards lower 
hip and knee flexion during BL (online supplementary 
material).
dIsCussIOn
This study supports the hypothesis that TF patterns 
would be altered following a strength intervention and 
that these changes would be consistent with the kinetic 
and kinematic changes that have been previously found 
to occur after strength training. In particular, we found 
changes in gluteal muscle forces and a lateral to medial 
shift in TF. In contrast, there were only small changes in 
GRF and the kinematics of landing.
lateral to medial shift in tibiofemoral joint loading
The most novel result in this study is the change in the 
pattern of TF after the intervention. Both groups experi-
enced a reduced lateral TF during the post-test; however, 
the decrease was greater in the IG than in the CG. In 
addition, the IG experienced an increase in the medial

TF at post-test, whereas the medial TF remained similar 
for the CG. Taken together, these data indicate a lateral 
to medial shift in knee loading, which was of significantly 
greater magnitude in the IG. Such a shift is consistent 
with a reduction in knee valgus, although we were unable 
to detect differences in kinematics. Both groups also 
experienced an increase in gluteal force postinterven-
tion, and it has been suggested that increased gluteal 
force can reduce valgus loading of the knee. The changes 
in both groups may be explained by a learning effect of 
the tasks in the post-test; however, the fact that the IG 
experienced greater changes in gluteal force and lateral 
to medial shift suggests that there was an effect of the 
intervention. The results of the present work tend to 
support the link between gluteal force and the medial/
lateral loading distribution of the tibiofemoral joint. In 
addition, these results suggest that strength training can 
facilitate women in using the gluteal musculature during 
landing in a way that possibly exhibits a lower risk of knee 
joint injuries such as ACL rupture, patellar dislocation 
and patellofemoral pain.
The fact that a lateral to medial shift in knee loading 
was found when there was an increased gluteal force 
(in both groups) is remarkably consistent with contem-
porary thinking. For instance, studies have identified 
relationships between increased hip strength/activation 
and improved neuromuscular alignment and control of 
the legs17 and increased gluteus medius activation and 
decreased TF.52 These studies in combination with our 
results suggest that a stronger posterior hip musculature 
can result in greater gluteal force expression, altered 
lateral to medial TF distribution and potentially affect 
valgus loading.
effect of strength training on landing kinematics and GrF
There were only small differences in landing kinematics 
preintervention to postintervention in both groups 
(frontal, sagittal and transverse plane), which is similar to 
another study that could not demonstrate knee valgus/
varus and knee/hip extension/flexion changes following 
a strength training programme.20 In contrast, one other 
study did show kinematic alterations of increased hip 
flexion at initial contact, and peak hip and knee flexion 
after a basic strength training programme21 (it should be 
noted that the programme employed in that study also 
included flexibility and balance training). The majority 
of prevention studies that found consistent alterations 
in kinematics included neuromuscular and feedback 
training, which were not employed in our study.7 53 54 The 
lack of kinematic differences in this study, despite the 
changes of internal kinetics, are important and suggest 
that either strength training in isolation does not affect 
kinematics, that kinematics are less sensitive to strength 
changes than internal kinetics or that musculoskeletal 
models of the type employed here are more sensitive to 
changes in internal kinetics than kinematics.
As described above, the inability of this study to demon-
strate statistically significant differences in knee varus/
valgus is consistent with previous studies that have looked 
at the effect of strength training.20 21 One reason for this 
may be the fact that optical motion capture methodol-
ogies are less able to discriminate between differences 
in internal/external rotation and abduction/adduction 
than between differences in joint flexion and extension 
due to the measurement error associated with soft-tissue 
artefact.55 In contrast, we have previously shown that the 
forces predicted by the model employed here are sensi-
tive to small changes in kinematics (in particular, that they 
are sensitive to small changes in the internal/external 
rotation of the tibia43). It is thus entirely credible to 
suggest that musculoskeletal models may be more sensi-
tive to changes in internal kinetics than more traditional 
approaches are to changes in kinematics. This may have 
important consequences for future assessment methods, 
particularly if ACL and knee injury risks are only assessed 
through a consideration of kinematic factors, in partic-
ular suggesting that clinical assessment methods should 
also incorporate the prediction of internal joint kinetics. 
The greater sensitivity could be used as an early indicator 
to prevent knee injuries and may detect smaller changes 
following intervention programmes. Consequently, this 
new perspective on joint conditions may offer greater 
detail in clinical diagnoses.
We were also unable to identify changes in GRF 
patterns preintervention and postintervention—this is in 
agreement with results of other studies that studied limb 
strengthening interventions,20 21 although contrary to a 
study that also focused on posterior thigh musculature.56 
Our findings suggest that either the change in force 
distribution between the joints altered due to internal 
modifications as GRF patterns stayed relatively constant 
or that the internal forces are particularly sensitive to 
small changes in GRF. Studies that found changes in GRF 
mostly included feedback or plyometric training, which 
probably included landing feedback training.53 54 57 This 
might suggest the necessity to incorporate direct feed-
back of landing technique if substantive changes in 
ground force application are a goal for the patient or 
athlete.
role of musculoskeletal modelling in clinical research
As far as we are aware, this is the first study that has used 
musculoskeletal modelling technology to assess the 
results of an exercise intervention. The unique finding 
of this study is the change in lateral to medial loading 
of the tibiofemoral joint following strength training. This 
is an observation that is previously unreported, probably 
due to the fact that other similar studies have relied on 
kinematic measurements. Similarly, we have recently 
successfully employed the same musculoskeletal model 
as in this study to report the effects of an acute inter-
vention on muscular forces during explosive activity.58 
Taken together, these studies therefore demonstrate 
the unique sensitivity and potential for musculoskel-
etal models to improve the understanding of problems 
with clinical relevance. However, to date, we have only

used this model to study differences at the cohort level. 
The employed model incorporates limited subject-spe-
cific detail and thus is currently unable to be used at a 
subject-specific level. Future work should establish the 
detail that is necessary to produce such specified results.
Conclusions
In summary, this study demonstrates that a training inter-
vention with a focus on posterior thigh strength resulted 
in a greater estimated use of the gluteal musculature 
during drop landings. This was commensurate with an 
altered pattern of joint loading; in particular, there was 
a change in force distribution at the tibiofemoral joint 
with a shift from lateral TF to medial TF, a change that 
is consistent with a reduced valgus and an increased hip 
joint loading. Potentially, this could reduce abnormal 
knee loading injuries that are related to valgus/varus 
forces such as ligament injuries (ie, ACL), kneecap 
dislocation, menisci and cartilage damage. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first time a change in the medial/lateral 
loading of the knee has been observed following a period 
of strength training. It is noteworthy that the changes in 
the internal force loading of the lower limbs were found 
despite there being only small concurrent changes in 
GRF and kinematics. This suggests that the joint loading 
may be more sensitive to changes in strength than kine-
matic measures, and that clinicians should be mindful 
when relying solely on kinematic measures.
Contributors MBC, JEG and DJC conceived of and designed the study. JEG and 
AMJB created and validated the strength test used in the study. DJC and AMJB 
created and tested the musculoskeletal model used in the study. MBC collected the 
data and supervised the intervention. MBC and DJC analysed the data and wrote 
the first draft of the paper. All authors were involved in the interpretation of the 
data, in redrafting the manuscript and in approving the final version.
