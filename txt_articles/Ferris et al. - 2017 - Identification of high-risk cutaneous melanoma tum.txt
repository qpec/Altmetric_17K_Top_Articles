Background: A significant proportion of patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)-
defined early-stage cutaneous melanoma have disease recurrence and die. A 31-gene expression profile
(GEP) that accurately assesses metastatic risk associated with primary cutaneous melanomas has been
described.
Objective: We sought to compare accuracy of the GEP in combination with risk determined using the web-
based AJCC Individualized Melanoma Patient Outcome Prediction Tool.
Methods: GEP results from 205 stage I/II cutaneous melanomas with sufficient clinical data for
prognostication using the AJCC tool were classified as low (class 1) or high (class 2) risk. Two 5-year
overall survival cutoffs (AJCC 79% and 68%), reflecting survival for patients with stage IIA or IIB disease,
respectively, were assigned for binary AJCC risk.
Results: Cox univariate analysis revealed significant risk classification of distant metastasis-free and overall
survival (hazard ratio range 3.2-9.4, P \.001) for both tools. In all, 43 (21%) cases had discordant GEP and
AJCC classification (using 79% cutoff). Eleven of 13 (85%) deaths in that group were predicted as high risk
by GEP but low risk by AJCC.
Limitations: Specimens reflect tertiary care center referrals; more effective therapies have been approved
for clinical use after accrual.

Clinical staging of primary
cutaneous melanoma (CM) is
important for evaluating an
individual
patient’s
condi-
tional risk of recurrence, as
stage
guides
decision-
making for patient surveil-
lance
and
treatment.
The
American Joint Committee
on Cancer (AJCC) melanoma
guidelines recommend using
tumor thickness, ulceration,
sentinel lymph node (SLN)
status, and mitotic rate for
stratifying patients
at low
and high risk.1-5 The impact
of stage-based stratification
of
risk,
as
reflected
in
the
current
National
Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, is that
imaging is not routinely recommended for patients
with stage I and IIA disease or asymptomatic
patients.6 Yet, because of the prevalence of patients
at early stage given a diagnosis each year, this lower
risk group represents two thirds of the patients who
ultimately die of melanoma each year.5,7
The impact of contemporary immunotherapy and
viral therapies on metastatic disease detected at the
time of lower tumor burden has been reported,
suggesting that a high intensity follow-up plan for
patients with high-risk melanoma may lead to earlier
detection of metastatic disease when therapeutic
efficacy can be enhanced.8-10 Thus, improving the
accuracy of identifying patients with high-risk dis-
ease not predicted by AJCC stage alone represents an
important actionable goal. A recently validated gene
expression
profile
(GEP)
test
(DecisionDx-
Melanoma, Castle Biosciences, Inc, Friendswood,
TX) with prognostic accuracy for identifying high-
risk, early-stage melanomas evaluates 31 genetic
targets to more accurately identify high-risk tumor
biology compared with clinical or pathologic assess-
ment alone.11,12 The test measures gene expression
levels from primary melanoma tumors to provide a
binary classification of low (class 1 with 5-year
distant metastasis-free survival [DMFS] of 91%) or
high (class 2 with 5-year DMFS of 57%) risk for
metastasis. Performance of the GEP test has been
reported in 2 multicenter validation studies, and was
shown to be an accurate
prognosticator
of
survival
independent
of
AJCC
stage.11,12
The
current
study
was
designed
to
compare
the
accuracy of the GEP prog-
nostic assay with the accu-
racy
of
risk
determined
using the web-based AJCC
Individualized
Melanoma
Patient Outcome Prediction
Tool. The AJCC prognostic
tool is frequently used by
clinicians to attain estimates
of 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-year sur-
vival based on clinical data,
which in turn directs appropriate patient treatment.13
The study includes 205 patients with previously
reported stage I and II melanoma and sufficient
clinical data to obtain 5-year survival predictions
from the AJCC tool, and compares the AJCC and GEP
predictions to determine whether gene expression
profiling, used in combination with current clinical
factors, enhances identification of patients with high-
risk melanoma.
METHODS
Sample and clinical data collection
Archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pri-
mary CM tissue and associated deidentified clinical
data were collected after institutional review board
approval from 6 US centers and processed as previ-
ously described.11 Inclusion in the study required
biopsy-confirmed stage I or II CM originally diag-
nosed between 1998 and 2009. Patients younger than
18 years or previously given a diagnosis of another
malignant tumor type were excluded. An earlier
censor (May 2013) of this cohort was previously
reported12; outcomes were updated with a censor
date of July 2015. All samples with successful GEP
classification were reviewed for clinical chart and
pathology report data.

Radial basis machine predictive modeling with
JMP Genomics SAS-based software (SAS, Cary,

or

were
previously
established using median probability score and
1SD from the median, and delineate a normal

AJCC prediction of risk
AJCC clinical staging factors (Breslow thickness,

Patient

Tool
(http://melanomaprognosis.net,
v7
American
Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC, Chicago, IL]
melanoma database, last accessed July 2015) to
attain predicted 5-year survival for each patient. As
5-year survival for patients with stage IIA (79%)
and stage IIB (68%) melanoma reflect cohorts of
patients who can receive significantly different
surveillance and therapeutic opportunities based
on national guidelines1 and high-risk determina-
tion by medical practices, these survivals were
selected as cutoff scores to establish low- and
high-risk groups based on the AJCC predicted
outcomes.
Study
analyses
were
performed
comparing the GEP test with the AJCC prognostic
tool as shown in Fig 1.
Study aims and statistical analysis
The primary aim for the study was the comparison
of the GEP-based classification with the AJCC online
prediction tool as an independent predictor of
recurrence-free survival (RFS) (recurrence defined
as any regional or distant metastasis detected after
determination of AJCC stage), DMFS (defined as a
distant metastasis detected beyond the regional ba-
sin), or overall survival (OS) (defined as death as a
result of any cause). The secondary aim of the study
was evaluation of the utility of the 2 tools used in
combination to better identify patients at a high risk
of metastatic disease. All analyses comparing the
prognostic tools were performed with a binary GEP
classification of class 1 versus class 2. To this end,
GEP classification was combined with the AJCC
prediction of risk to produce 4 subgroups: class 1/
AJCC low risk, class 1/AJCC high risk, class 2/AJCC
low risk, and class 2/AJCC high risk. Kaplan-Meier
analysis and Cox proportional hazards survival
analysis
were
performed
using
WinSTAT
for
Microsoft Excel version 2012.1 (R. Fitch Software,
Cambridge, MA).
RESULTS
Demographics of the study cohort
A total of 205 primary melanoma tumors collected
from 6 US centers were evaluated during the study
(Supplementary Table I; available at http://www.
jaad.org). The cohort included 109 stage I (68 stage
IA, 39 stage IB, 2 with unspecified substage) and 96
stage II (40 stage IIA, 41 stage IIB, 14 stage IIC, 1 with
unspecified substage) cases.
Independent and combined GEP and AJCC
prediction of risk
Sensitivity and specificity of each of the prog-
nostic tools (GEP, AJCC 79%, AJCC 68%), both
independently and in combination, was also deter-
mined (Table I and Supplementary Table II [available
at http://www.jaad.org]). Using the binary class 1
versus class 2 GEP classification of risk, the analysis
revealed a significantly higher sensitivity, but lower
specificity, for the GEP test compared with the AJCC
predictor, with both the 79% and 68% cutoff scores.
As shown in Table I, the sensitivities of the GEP test
to accurately identify as class 2 patients who expe-
rienced
recurrences,
distant
metastasis,
and
melanoma-specific deaths were 82%, 81%, and
78%, respectively. Comparably, the AJCC tool using
the 79% cutoff achieved sensitivities of 70%, 69%,
and 60%, respectively, for each end point; using the

 68% cutoff achieved sensitivities of 36%, 40%, and
28%, respectively. Results indicate a significant
further increase in sensitivity when the AJCC and
GEP tests were considered collectively. The sensi-
tivities of the combined GEP and AJCC 79% tools to
accurately identify as patients at high risk who
experienced recurrences, distant metastasis, and
melanoma-specific deaths were 90%, 88%, and
82%, respectively, with specificities of 71%, 63%,
and 62%, respectively.
Cox univariate analysis of RFS, DMFS, and OS
resulted in a statistically significant risk assessment
for all 3 predictors (Supplementary Table III; avail-
able
at
http://www.jaad.org).
Multivariate
Cox
regression (Table II) comparing GEP with each of
the AJCC tools (GEP vs AJCC 79% cutoff or GEP vs
AJCC 68% cutoff) indicates that the GEP predictor is
more significantly associated with the end points of
distant metastasis and death than the binary classifi-
cation based on the AJCC predicted risk. Direct

 risk, resulted in GEP and AJCC 79% hazard ratio
values of 5.9 (P \.0001) versus 3.6 (P \.0001) for
prediction of recurrence, 5.3 (P \.0001) versus 3.0
(P = .002) for prediction of distant metastasis, and 5.3
(P \ .0001) versus 2.2 (P = .02) for prediction of
death, respectively. Similarly, comparison of GEP
with AJCC with a cutoff of 68% led to hazard ratio
values of 8.9 (P \ .0001) versus 2.3 (P = .002) for
prediction of recurrence, 7.2 (P \.0001) versus 2.7
(P = .001) for prediction of distant metastasis, and 7.1
(P\.0001) versus 1.5 (P = .2) for prediction of death,
respectively.
Survival outcomes for combined GEP and AJCC
prediction of risk
Kaplan-Meier analysis of cases with concordant
low- or high-risk predictions from both tools resulted
in the highest and lowest 5-year survival for both end
points, with RFS, DMFS, and OS of 95%, 96%, and
96%, respectively, for class 1/AJCC low-risk cases,
compared with 17%, 39%, and 44%, respectively, for
class 2/AJCC high-risk cases (Fig 2). Thirteen class 1/
AJCC high-risk cases were identified with 5-year RFS,
DMFS, and OS of 75%, 92% and 83%, respectively.
RFS, DMFS, and OS of 62%, 76%, and 71%, respec-
tively were seen in class 2/AJCC low-risk cases
(n = 30).
The pie charts in Fig 2 show the concordant and
discordant GEP and AJCC predictions of risk for
those cases that experienced a recurrence, distant
metastasis, or death. Of clinical significance, 82% of
recurrences, 81% of distant metastases, and 78% of
deaths were identified as high-risk class 2, compared
with 69%, 69%, and 60%, respectively, identified as
high risk by AJCC. Combining the AJCC predictor
with the GEP resulted in accurate identification of
90% of cases with recurrences, 88% of distant
metastases, and 82% of deaths.
Analysis of cases with discordant prediction of
risk
Of the 205 cases included in the study, 43 (21%)
resulted in discordant predicted outcomes when
comparing the GEP and AJCC 79% prognostic tools.
As shown in Table III, 30 cases were predicted to be
high-risk class 2 by the GEP and low risk by the AJCC
predictor, whereas 13 cases were low-risk class 1 and
high risk according to the AJCC tool. Fourteen (46%)
class 2/AJCC low-risk cases experienced an outcome
event: 13 (43%; median Breslow 1.5 mm; 2 with
ulceration) developed regional or distant metastasis,
9 (30%) developed distant metastasis, and 11 (37%)
resulted in death. Comparably, 5 (38%) class 1/AJCC
high-risk cases experienced an outcome event: 5
(38%; median Breslow 1.7 mm; 3 ulcerated) with a
regional or distant metastatic event, 3 (23%) with
distant metastasis, and 2 (15%) resulted in death.
Notably, of these class 1/AJCC high-risk cases, 4 of
the regional or distant metastatic events, 3 with
distant metastasis, and 1 death occurred in cases
called class 1B, with probability scores falling within
the reduced confidence range (Table III). Of clinical
significance, the cohort of cases that experienced
adverse events and were identified as low risk
according to the AJCC predictor, but high-risk class
2 according to GEP, included 11 stage IA, IB, and IIA
cases.
DISCUSSION
The AJCC TNM staging system for melanoma
guides clinical decisions regarding consideration of
referral for SLN mapping, frequency and intensity of
surveillance, consideration of adjuvant therapy,
and clinical trial opportunities. Because patients at
stage I and II comprise the vast majority of the
melanoma diagnoses, more than 2 of 3 deaths
related to CM occur in this group of patients
initially given a diagnosis of node-negative disease
(AJCC stages I-II). The most recent update to the
AJCC melanoma staging criteria (v7, 2010) recom-
mends discussion of the utility of SLN biopsy with
any patient presenting with ulceration or mitotic rate
greater than or equal to 1/mm2 (stage IB-II).4 As a
result, the procedure is commonly performed in
thin melanomas with a positive SLN yield of less than
5%. Also, fewer than 20% of patients who are SLN-
positive experience subsequent distant metastatic
disease.14-19
The current study was designed to compare
independent prediction of risk by the GEP or the
AJCC Individualized Melanoma Patient Outcome
Prediction
Tool,
and
the
potential
utility
of
combining the results of the 2 prognosticators. Our
findings identified the GEP test as a strong indepen-
dent predictor of risk, and Cox univariate and
multivariate regression analysis indicated a highly
=
with a metastasis or death, and indicate that over 25% of cases with events had discordant risk
prediction with the 2 tests. Significantly different from: *class 1/AJCC low risk; yclass 1/AJCC

 significant association between the class 2 gene
signature and increased risk of recurrence and death.
As reported, combining results from the 2 tools
enhanced sensitivity, reflecting a more accurate
identification of patients with high-risk stage I and
II melanoma. Although increased sensitivity is
achieved with concurrent loss of specificity, for
each of the end points analyzed gains in sensitivity
when combining the GEP with AJCC tools outweigh
the reduction in specificity (Table I).
In summary, this report shows that the GEP test,
when used in combination with AJCC, can improve
identification of those patients with stage I and II CM
and a high risk of developing recurrence, metastatic
disease, or both. Importantly, 11 of the 13 patients
predicted as low risk by the AJCC tool but classified
as high risk (class 2) by the GEP were stage I or IIA.
These patients would traditionally be treated with
less intensive surveillance plans and no opportunity
for adjuvant intervention to prevent recurrence. With
the development of novel and effective therapeutic
advances with improved toxicity profiles, including
the recent approval of ipilimumab for patients with
stage III disease and other agents currently under
investigation, incorporation of the GEP test to
current staging methods may offer the ability to
identify the majority of patients at risk for metastasis
and death who could potentially benefit from more
aggressive and early therapeutic intervention.10,20
Notably, improved efficacy has been observed for
several melanoma therapies when administered to
patients with lower tumor burden.8-10 Conversely,
GEP low-risk (class 1) classification can provide an
opportunity to decrease follow-up intensity and
avoid overtreatment of patients with less biologically
aggressive tumors.21 Combining GEP-based classifi-
cation with AJCC staging may help identify the
majority
of
patients
who
would
benefit
from
increased clinical and imaging-based surveillance,
to identify metastatic disease earlier and ultimately
administer the most effective therapies developed to
date to improve patient outcomes.
