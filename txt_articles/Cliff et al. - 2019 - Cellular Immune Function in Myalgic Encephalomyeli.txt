Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition
with unknown aetiology, Myalgic encephalomyelitis unclear pathophysiology and with no
diagnostic test or biomarker available. Many patients report their ME/CFS began after
an acute infection, and subsequent increased frequency of infections, such as colds
or influenza, is common. These factors imply an altered immunological status exists in
ME/CFS, in at least a proportion of patients, yet previous studies of peripheral immunity
have been discrepant and inconclusive. The UK ME/CFS Biobank, which has collected
blood samples from nearly 300 clinically-confirmed ME/CFS patients, enables large-scale
studies of immunological function in phenotypically well-characterised participants. In
this study, herpes virus serological status and T cell, B cell, NK cell and monocyte
populations were investigated in 251 ME/CFS patients, including 54 who were severely
affected, and compared with those from 107 healthy participants and with 46 patients
with Multiple Sclerosis. There were no differences in seroprevalence for six human
herpes viruses between ME/CFS and healthy controls, although seroprevalence for the
Epstein-Barr virus was higher in multiple sclerosis patients. Contrary to previous reports,
no significant differences were observed in NK cell numbers, subtype proportions or
in vitro responsiveness between ME/CFS patients and healthy control participants. In
contrast, the T cell compartment was altered in ME/CFS, with increased proportions
of effector memory CD8+ T cells and decreased proportions of terminally differentiated
effector CD8+ T cells. Conversely, there was a significantly increased proportion of
mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells, especially in severely affected ME/CFS
patients. These abnormalities demonstrate that an altered immunological state does exist
in ME/CFS, particularly in severely affected people. This may simply reflect ongoing or
recent infection, or may indicate future increased susceptibility to infection. Longitudinal
studies of ME/CFS patients are needed to help to determine cause and effect and thus
any potential benefits of immuno-modulatory treatments for ME/CFS.

Increased MAIT Cell Frequency in ME/CFS
INTRODUCTION
Myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy)/chronic fatigue
syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterised by unexplained persistent
or recurrent incapacitating fatigue for over 6 months leading
to substantial reductions in previous levels of occupational,
educational, social and personal activities (1, 2) and, often, by
moderate or severe physical disability and significant reductions
in quality of life (3, 4). With population prevalence rates
estimated at 0.1–0.4%, ME/CFS has considerable societal and
economic impacts due to its chronic nature, its tendency to affect
young adults in the most productive periods of their lives, and
its impact on family and friends (3, 5–7). The aetiology remains
elusive. Currently, there are no confirmatory diagnostic tests or
specific, evidence-based treatments that are widely accepted and
that consider the heterogeneity of symptoms and their fluctuating
nature. Thus, despite some significant recent advances (8, 9),
ME/CFS continues to be poorly understood. Unfortunately,
many apparently interesting research findings results have not
proven reproducible (10), due in part to the small size and
cross-sectional nature of many studies, and to variability between
studies in the research methods used and their quality.
Acute viral infections have frequently been associated with
the onset of ME/CFS (9) but no specific viral aetiology has
been confirmed and there is no consistent association between
persistent or chronic virus infection and ME/CFS. One possibility
is that people with ME/CFS (PWME) are susceptible to
acute viral infections as a consequence of underlying immune
dysfunction. Numerous immune abnormalities, including altered
plasma cytokine profiles, abnormal T lymphocyte activation
and impaired cytotoxic responses, have been described in
individuals with ME/CFS (5, 7), but recent systematic reviews
and
observational
studies
have
failed
to
identify
robust
and reproducible immune biomarkers of disease or disease
severity (11–13).
There have been a number of reports of inconsistent
abnormalities in natural killer (NK) cell function. NK cells are
large granular lymphocytes that function as innate immune
effectors that, by cytokine production or cytotoxicity, contain
infections (or neoplasias) until an effective adaptive response
can be mounted. Individuals with inherited NK cell disorders
are highly susceptible to systemic herpes virus and other
opportunistic infections (14). Direct NK cell activation follows
interaction with cells which lack major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) Class I ligands for inhibitory NK cell receptors
and/or express stress-induced ligands for NK cell activating
receptors. Indirect NK cell activation occurs following microbial
ligation of pattern recognition receptors on myeloid accessory
cells and is mediated by cytokines (IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IFN-α)
and by contact-dependent stimuli (15, 16). PWME have been
variously reported to have increased (17, 18), decreased (19,
20) or normal (21–23) numbers of circulating NK (CD16+ or
CD56+, CD3−) cells; their NK cells are reportedly deficient in
Maher et al. (24) or have enhanced expression of Huth et al.
(25) the cytotoxic molecule perforin; are less able (or fully able)
to lyse MHC Class 1 deficient target cells (19, 21, 22, 26); and
are defective (or not) in their upregulation of activation markers
after in vitro stimulation (21, 22, 27). Again, the reproducibility
of many of these studies is hampered by their relatively small
size, the diverse clinical presentations of the cases, or the limited
extent of the immunological characterisation in any one study.
Importantly, only one (23) of these immunological studies
has taken account of the prevalence of human cytomegalovirus
(CMV) infection in cases and controls. CMV infection leaves
a permanent footprint on the immune system including
oligoclonal expansions and terminal differentiation of CD8+ T
cells and expansion of a subset of highly differentiated NKG2C+
NK cells (28); this NK population is further expanded by
subsequent viral infection (28, 29). It remains possible therefore,
that the reported differences in T cell and NK cell phenotype and
functional capacity between PWME and healthy controls may
result from differences in the prevalence of immunomodulatory
viruses such as CMV. Here we report an in-depth analysis
of peripheral blood leucocyte phenotype and function in a
clinically well-defined cohort of moderately and severely affected
ME/CFS cases compared to non-fatigued healthy controls and,
as a control for reduced levels of physical activity, people with
multiple sclerosis. All participants were screened for serological
evidence of human cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus
(EBV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), Herpes simplex virus 2
(HSV2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and human herpesvirus
(HHV6) infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recruitment and Clinical Evaluation
Study participants, including PWME, multiple sclerosis (MS)
and non-fatigued healthy controls, were recruited through the
UK National Health Service (NHS) primary and secondary
health care services. In addition, some people with clinically
confirmed severe ME/CFS were identified via support groups
and were invited to participate. All potential participants were
rigorously assessed to ensure that they met the study case
definitions for ME/CFS. Non-fatigued healthy controls were also
recruited by advertisement within Higher Education Institutions
or were friends or family members of PWME. Ethical approval
was granted by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical
Medicine (LSHTM) Ethics Committee (Ref. 6123) and the
National Research Ethics Service (NRES) London-Bloomsbury
Research Ethics Committee (REC ref. 11/10/1760, IRAS ID:
77765). All participants provided written informed consent for
questionnaire, clinical measurement and laboratory test data,
and for samples to be made available for ethically-approved
research, after receiving an extensive information sheet and
consent form, which included an option to withdraw from the
study at any time.
All participants with ME/CFS or MS had previously received
a confirmed medical diagnosis. Participants were aged between
18 and 60 years. PWME were reassessed by clinical research
staff for compliance with the Canadian Consensus (2) and/or
CDC-1994 (“Fukuda”) (1) criteria, which were the study case
definitions, before recruitment into this study. Participants were
excluded if they had (i) taken antiviral medication or drugs
known to alter immune function in the preceding 3 months;

(ii) had any vaccinations in the preceding 3 months; (iii) had
a history of acute and chronic infectious diseases such as
hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, HIV (but not herpes virus or
other retrovirus infection); (iv) another chronic disease such
as cancer, coronary heart disease, or uncontrolled diabetes; (v)
a severe mood disorder; (vi) been pregnant or breastfeeding
in the preceding 12 months; or (vii) were morbidly obese
(BMI ≥ 40). Once eligibility was confirmed, participants were
invited to a recruiting centre for clinical assessment and blood
sample collection: this included the healthy controls, PWME
and people with MS. Those participants with severe disease and
mobility restrictions were visited at home by a research nurse.
Supplementary Table S1 shows the range of clinical variables
including the Fatigue Severity Scale (30) collected from the study
population, some of which were used for assessing eligibility.
Participants were not excluded on the basis of minor ailments
such as sore throat, fever/chills, tender glands, flu symptoms, and
or new sensitivity/allergy, to avoid developing an artificial control
group. All participants were part of the UK ME/CFS Biobank
(UKMEB); further details on the method used for selection and
recruitment of participants and processing of data and samples
were described previously (31).
Power Calculation
We recruited 404 participants comprising 251 with ME/CFS
(54 severely affected and 197 mild/moderate cases), 46 cases
of MS, and 107 healthy controls. Based on our own data on
NK cell responses to cytokine stimulation in HCMV-infected
healthy adults (32) we estimated that the proposed sample size
would provide at least 80% power to detect a 30% difference in
NK cell responses between MS and severely affected cases (the
comparison requiring the highest sample size) and >90% power
to detect a 20% difference in NK cell response between cases and
healthy controls (Epi Info, version 3.5.53).
Sample Collection and Processing,
Including PBMC Freezing
Blood samples were collected in sodium heparin (for PBMC) or
in potassium EDTA (for plasma) vacutainers (Becton Dickinson)
and transported within Pathopak containers (in compliance
with UN 3373 regulations), at room temperature (18–25◦C)
protected from direct sunlight and extremes of environmental
temperature. Samples were delivered to the University College
London / Royal Free Hospital (UCL/RFH) BioBank laboratories
for processing and storage within 6 h of collection: the average
time from collection to processing was 2.5 h across all four study
groups. Serum, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) were processed and aliquoted in volumes of 200 µl to
2 ml. PBMCs were aliquoted at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots were
stored in 1 or 2 ml cryotubes, in vapour phase liquid nitrogen at
−180◦C, and shipped to LSHTM for laboratory analysis on dry
ice. Each aliquot was labelled with a 2D bar code corresponding
to a unique 15 digit ISBT 128 (global standard) identifier which
also served to anonymise the samples. All laboratory evaluations
were performed in a blinded manner with samples identified only
by their unique identifier.
Herpesviruses Serology
Plasma concentrations of IgG to herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV
1), HSV 2, Varicella Zoster virus (VZV), human cytomegalovirus
(CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen (VCA),
and EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA 1) and human herpes virus
6 (HHV 6) were assayed by commercial quantitative ELISA
[Demeditec Diagnostics, Germany for all viruses, except HHV6
assay from VIDIA (Vestec, Czech Republic)] according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. IgG concentrations were expressed
as arbitrary units per millilitre (U/ml). For HSV1, HSV 2,
VZV, CMV and EBV, samples with IgG concentration ≤8 U/ml
were scored as negative and those with concentration ≥12
U/ml were regarded as positive. Samples with IgG concentration
between 8 and 12 were regarded as equivocal and were re-
tested. Samples were recorded as EBV seropositive if they
gave a positive reaction to EBV-VCA and/or EBNA 1. For
HHV-6, concentrations ≤10.5 U/ml were considered negative,
while concentrations ≥12.5 U/ml were considered positive.
Samples giving concentrations between 10.5 and 12.5 U/ml were
considered equivocal and re-tested.
Leucocyte Phenotyping
Cryopreserved
PBMCs
were
transported
to
the
research
laboratory on dry ice, and analysed in mixed batches containing
samples across the four clinical groups. PBMC were thawed
by addition of warm RPMI-1640 tissue culture medium
(Invitrogen), washed in RPMI containing 1% foetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen) and counted by trypan blue exclusion. Cells
were resuspended at 4 x 106 cells/ml in complete medium
[RPMI-1640 plus 10% human AB serum (Sigma) and 1%
penicillin, streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen)]. Cells were
either used immediately for ex vivo phenotyping or were
placed in culture for functional analysis. For flow cytometry,
cells (200,000/well) were aliquoted into 96 well V-bottom
microtitre plates, stained as described previously (32) in
Cytofix/CytopermTM for intracellular stains, and analysed on an
LSR-II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Antibody staining
panels are shown in Supplementary Tables S2, S3. Data were
collected in FACSDiva v6.1 and analysed using Flowjo v10
(TreeStar) and SPICE (33) software.
Functional Assays
Cells
were
aliquoted
(200,000
cells/well)
into
U-bottom
microtitre plates together with one of the following stimuli:
complete medium (negative control), cell stimulation cocktail
(81 nM
PMA/1.34 µM
ionomycin;
eBioscience);
CpG2216
(2.5 µM; Invivogen), IL-12+IL-18 (5 and 50 ng/ml respectively;
Peprotech and R&D, respectively) or MHC Class-I deficient
K562 cells (at a host:target cell ratio of 2:1). In addition,
cells were plated into flat-bottom microtitre plates that had
previously been coated overnight with anti-CD16 antibody
(20 µg/ml, Becton Dickinson) or an isotype control antibody
(20 µg/ml; eBioscience). After incubation at 37◦C in 5% CO2
for 1 h (cell stimulation cocktail) or 15 h (all other stimuli),
brefeldin A (Golgiplug; final concentration 1:1,000; Becton
Dickinson) and monensin (Golgistop, final concentration
1:1,500; Becton Dickinson) were added to each well and plates

Increased MAIT Cell Frequency in ME/CFS
were then incubated for a further 3 h before staining for flow
cytometry (as above). For any assays of CD107a expression,
anti-CD107a antibody was added to wells at the start of the
culture period. The 17 h incubation period was selected, based
on our previous reports (34–36), to allow for upregulation of
both IFNγ and CD25, and degranulation via both direct and
indirect mechanisms.
Data Analysis
The primary data analysis comprised four groups of participants:
people with mild/moderate ME/CFS (ME-M), people severely
affected by ME/CFS (ME-S), healthy controls (C), and people
with multiple sclerosis (MS). All data analyses were carried out
in a blinded manner with groups identified by a code number;
the code was broken only after all analyses were complete.
Univariate analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism
v7.01 unless otherwise stated. Continuous variable datasets were
checked for Normal distribution by D’Agostino & Pearson test,
and analysed by ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for parametric
or non-parametric datasets respectively when comparing clinical
groups, or by Student’s T-test or Mann Whitney test respectively
when comparing the CMV serostatus on the outcome variables.
All P-values reported are after correcting for multiple testing
using Tukey’s test for parametric data or Dunn’s test for
non-parametric data. Differences between clinical groups in
herpesvirus seroprevalences were analysed by Chi squared test,
using Stata version 15.1. Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) curve analysis was conducted in GraphPad Prism.
The above analysis was extended to control for possible
confounding variables using R statistical software (37). For
flow cytometry data, the percentages of each cell subpopulation
were conveniently transformed into the respective log-odds
[e.g., log %CD4+/(100%–%CD4+)]: the resulting data followed
approximately normal distributions. Multiple linear regression
was used to compare the outcome variables between groups; all
regression models included gender, age at recruitment, analysis
batch and seropositivity for each herpes virus as confounding
factors. To determine the significance of differences between
clinical groups, regression models including group as a variable
were compared with models excluding group using the likelihood
ratio test. The significance level of each individual test was
determined to ensure an overall significance level in a context of
multiple testing. The significance level was pre-specified at 5% for
each separate analysis.
RESULTS
Study Participant Characteristics
The final cohort comprised 251 people with ME/CFS (197
mild/moderate and 54 severe), 46 people with MS and 107
healthy controls. The demographic and clinical characteristics
of the cohort are summarised in Table 1. Symptoms typically
associated with infection or inflammation were more frequent
and more severe among PWME than among those with MS,
although mild symptoms of inflammation were present in nearly
50% of people with MS. Most healthy controls did not present
with any symptoms (P < 0.0001). Fatigue severity scores were, as
expected, higher in PWME, with a trend towards higher scores in
those severely affected, followed by people with mild/moderate
ME/CFS, then people with MS and healthy controls presenting
very low levels of fatigue (P < 0.001). Erythrocyte Sedimentation
Rate (ESR), a non-specific marker of inflammation, was slightly
raised in people with mild/moderate ME/CFS, with similar
median values found in all other groups (P = 0.01). Those with
MS were slightly older compared to other study groups, but
distribution by sex, deprivation index, and total white blood cells
and lymphocytes was similar across the groups.
Serology
Plasma samples were tested by quantitative ELISA for six of
the human herpesviruses, HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, CMV, EBV,
and HHV6. There were no significant differences between the
groups in the proportions of individuals who were seropositive
for any of these viruses (Table 1). However, concentrations
of anti-EBV VCA varied significantly among the groups
(Kruskal-Wallis test: P = 0.016) and this was due to higher
concentrations of anti-EBV VCA antibodies among people with
MS (Supplementary Figure S1).
Leucocyte Phenotyping
Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells were thawed
and analysed by flow cytometry; cell gating is shown in Figure 1.
A generous leucocyte gate was set to include all live cells and then
a more restrictive lymphocyte gate was set. Within the leucocyte
gate, monocytes were identified by CD14 positivity and CD3
negativity whilst dendritic cells were identified as CD14/CD3
negative and either CD11c positive (myeloid DC) or CD123
positive (plasmacytoid DC). Within the lymphocyte gate, T cells
were gated as CD3+ and either CD4+ or CD8+; B cells as CD19+
and natural killer (NK) cells as CD3 negative/CD56 positive.
NK cells were subsequently analysed for expression of NKG2C,
NKp46, and CD57.
In an unadjusted ANOVA analysis, there were significant
differences between the groups in the proportions of live
leucocytes that were monocytes (P = 0.0133), myeloid DCs
(P < 0.0121), and plasmacytoid DCs (P < 0.0001) (Figure 2):
these differences were due to altered frequencies in the multiple
sclerosis patients, and disappeared after adjusting for gender,
age and herpesvirus sero-positivity (not shown). By contrast, the
proportions of leucocytes that were B cells, T cells or NK cells did
not differ significantly among the groups in either the adjusted or
the unadjusted analysis.
Within the lymphocyte gate, the proportions of cells that were
either CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells (and, as a consequence,
the CD4/CD8 ratio) differed significantly between groups in
the unadjusted analysis (ANOVA P < 0.0001 in each case) and
these differences persisted after adjusting for confounders (P <
0.0001 in each case) (Figure 3). However, these differences were
entirely due to significantly higher proportions of CD4+ T cells,
lower proportions of CD8+ T cells and thus a higher CD4/CD8
ratio in the MS patients; there were no significant differences
in lymphocyte distribution between ME/CFS cases and healthy
controls. Similarly, there were no significant differences between

More detailed phenotyping of the circulating T cell population
revealed no major differences in the distribution of CD45RA-
and CCR7-defined naïve and memory T cell populations in
univariate analysis (Figure 4). In a more detailed phenotypic
analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments by analysis
of CD28 and CD57 alongside CCR7 and CD45RA, we found
that there were no differences in the CD4+ T cell differentiation
subpopulations
in
people
with
ME/CFS,
although
there
were altered cell population frequencies in people with MS
(Figure 5A).
However,
modest
differences
were
observed
in several differentiation populations in the CD8+ T cell
compartment (Figure 5B) with a small increase in the proportion
of EM cells (CCR7-CD45RA-CD28-CD57-) and a reduction in
the proportion of terminally differentiated cytotoxic effector
TEMRA cells (CCR7-CD45RA+CD28–CD57+) in people living
with ME/CFS. There were also small changes in other minor

Of greater potential relevance, however, using TCR Vα7.2 and
CD161 to define circulating populations of mucosal associated
invariant T (MAIT) cells, we observed highly significant
differences between the groups in the proportion of T cells that
are MAIT cells and the proportion of MAIT cells that express
CD8 (unadjusted ANOVA, P < 0.001 in both cases) (Figure 6).
After adjusting for confounding, the multiple linear regression
analysis revealed that this was due to increased proportions of
MAIT cells (P < 0.001), and particularly of CD8+ MAIT cells, in
people with severe ME/CFS compared to healthy controls (P <
10−5). Importantly however, although the overall proportions of
MAIT cells were not higher among people with MS than among
healthy controls, their MAIT cells were also heavily skewed
to the CD8+ subset, indicating that this is not a diagnostic
feature of severe ME/CFS cases. ROC analysis showed that the

showed a weak capacity to discriminate severely affected ME/CFS
patients from healthy controls, but that the mild/moderately
affected patients were not predicted by this measure. Potentially
more importantly, the proportion of MAIT cells which were
CD8+ (Figure 6G) had a greater capacity to discriminate severe
ME/CFS from health, with an AUC of 0.756. In accordance
with previous reports (38), the vast majority of MAIT cells in
all subjects had an undifferentiated (CD28+ CD57−) phenotype
(Supplementary Figure S3).
Looking in more detail at the phenotype of the NK
cell population, we observed no significant differences in
the proportions of CD56 bright cells, in the distribution of
CD57−, CD57+ or CD57++ cells or in the proportions of
cells expressing either NKG2C or NKp46 (Figure 7) or in
the expression of six different killer cell immunoglobulin-
like receptors (KIR) (Supplementary Figure S4) in either the
adjusted or the unadjusted analysis.
T Cell and NK Cell Function
We next compared the ability of T cells and NK cells from
healthy controls, people with MS and PWME to respond to
in vitro stimulation. For assessment of T cell responsiveness,
PBMCs were cultured for 4 h with the mitogenic cocktail of
PMA and ionomycin and then stained for intracellular cytokines.
The proportion of cells producing IL-2, IFN-γ or a combination
of IL-2 and IFN-γ was assessed in the CD3+ CD4+ and the
CD3+ CD8+ cell populations but no significant differences were
observed among the groups in either the adjusted or unadjusted
analysis (Figure 8).
NK cell function was assessed by culturing PBMCs for 18 h
with IL-12 plus IL-18, with CpG, with MHC Class-I deficient
K562 cells or in plates coated with a cross-linking antibody
to CD16. CD3−/CD56+ NK cells were gated and analysed for
intracellular IFN-γ or for cell surface expression of the activation
marker CD25 or the degranulation marker CD107a (LAMP-
1) (Figure 9). Again, no significant differences were detected

the responses.
Interaction Between Herpesvirus Infection
Status and Lymphocyte Phenotype
and Function
Herpesvirus infection, most notably infection with CMV, is
known to affect both the maturational phenotype and the
function of human CD8+ T cells (39) and NK cells (28).
We therefore compared lymphocyte phenotype and function
among those subjects who were either seropositive or not for
CMV. Across all the study groups, participants who were CMV-
seropositive had significantly lower proportions of CD4+ and
higher proportions of CD8+ T cells amongst their PBMC
(Supplementary Figure S5). Following stimulation with PMA
and ionomycin, higher proportions of both CD4+ and CD8+
T cells made IFNγ, and more cells were IL-2 and IFNγ double
positive, amongst CMV seropositive individuals. The proportion
of PBMC which were CD3+CD56+ (NKT-like) cells was highly
significantly enhanced amongst CMV-positive participants. In
the NK cell population, more cells were NKG2C+, and there were
decreased proportions of CD56dimCD57intermediate and increased
proportions of CD56dimCD57bright amongst CMV-seropositive
participants. Amongst CMV-seropositive individuals, there was
a decreased in vitro response to IL-12 and IL-18 stimulation,
with significantly reduced CD25, CD107, and IFNγ expression
(Supplementary Figure S5G).
DISCUSSION
In a cohort of 250 well-characterised people living with ME/CFS,
including a number who are severely affected, we have identified
differences in peripheral immune cell phenotype compared to
healthy control individuals. These include highly significantly
enhanced proportions of mucosal associated invariant T cells,
particularly CD8+ MAIT cells, in PWME compared to healthy
controls, and these were further enhanced in individuals who
had severe disease manifestation. We also found an enhancement
in the proportion of effector memory CD8+ T cells, a
reduction in the proportion of terminally differentiated effector
TEMRA cells, and minor modulations in different CD8+ T cell
differentiation subcompartments in PWME. The functional role
and consequence of change within these different CD8+ T cell
subpopulations remains to be determined. We did not find any
evidence for altered function of T cells in PWME. Of note, we did
not find any differences in the proportions of NK cells in PWME,
or in their differentiation status, their expression of KIR receptors
or of activation markers ex vivo or following in vitro stimulation.
Based on previous reports of abnormal NK cell function in
ME/CFS (17–19, 24, 25, 27, 40) this was an unexpected finding,
although is consistent with a small number of previous reports of
normal NK cell proportion and function (21–23). In our system,
we cultured PBMC for 18 h to allow time for direct and indirect
cell activation: it is possible that differences in degranulation
or cytokine production may have been observed with a shorter
stimulation period. However, we did find significant differences

we observed in MAIT cells and CD8+ T cells in PWME were
consistent when CMV serostatus was adjusted for.
ME/CFS is often considered to be triggered by an acute viral
infection, and various herpes virus family members have been
implicated (41). Here, we found no difference in the prevalence
of seropositivity for six herpes viruses (CMV, EBV, HSV-1, HSV-
2, VZV, HHV6) between PWME and healthy controls, nor in
the concentration of anti-virus antibodies present. Nonetheless,
the possibility remains that herpes viruses may be important
in ME/CFS pathogenesis, that virus reactivation may trigger
a worsening of symptoms, and that measurement of antibody
titres to alternative viral antigens might provide a more relevant
measure (42). Thus, although the seroprevalence of EBV did
not differ among the MS patients, PWME or healthy controls,
MS patients did have significantly higher titres of antibodies
to EBV Viral Capsid Antigen, in line with previous reports
[reviewed by Burnard et al. (43)] and potentially implying recent
virus reactivation.
The increased frequency of CD8+ MAIT cells in those
severely affected by ME/CFS observed here has not previously
been reported. Notably, a small number of severely affected
ME/CFS patients had exceedingly high frequencies of these cells.
Peripheral MAIT cell frequencies in healthy volunteers have been
reported to increase over 2-fold following acute exercise (44),
suggesting that the peripheral immune phenotype at rest in some
PWME resembles a post-exercise state. The more remarkable
finding, however, was the overwhelming predominance of CD8+
cells among the MAIT cell population in severely affected
PWME. Moreover, although overall frequencies of MAIT cells
did not differ between MS patients and healthy controls, their
MAIT cells were also highly enriched for CD8+ cells, confirming
a previous report of high frequencies of CD8+ CD161+ T cells
in MS patients (45). MAIT cells are innate-like T cells which
recognise vitamin B-related antigens from microbes presented
in the context of the MHC Class I-related molecule MR1 (46),
and can also respond to cytokine stimulation. CD8+ MAIT cells
are able to kill infected cells via perforin/granzyme secretion
and therefore have a protective role in microbial infection (47),
but they have recently been implicated in the pathology of
various non-infectious diseases such as cancer (48), colitis (49)
and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (50) and
type 1 diabetes (51). In MS, these cells are described as pro-
inflammatory and pathogenic. It is possible that the increase
in MAIT cell frequency in some PWME is driven by changes
in the gut microbiome (52) or alternatively could be related to
other, as yet uncharacterised, changes in the immune system.
In future studies, the functional phenotype of these CD8+
MAIT cells in PWME could be ascertained, to determine if they
may be contributing to disease pathology. The gut microbiome
in ME/CFS should also be investigated further. Eventually

Increased MAIT Cell Frequency in ME/CFS
a biomarker signature might be developed for diagnosis of
ME/CFS: in this context the proportion of CD8+ MAIT
cells in peripheral blood had modest discriminatory capacity
alone, but might contribute to a combined factor signature.
In this regard, testing of candidate biomarker signatures in
large, independent, longitudinal validation cohorts will be vital,
especially considering historically mixed reports of biological
phenotype in ME/CFS.
The
reason
for
the
altered
frequencies
of
various
intermediately differentiated CD8+ T cells in ME/CFS is
unclear, and is likely to be functionally linked with the
concomitant reduction in effector memory CD8+ T cells (53). As
there was no difference in the frequency of naïve or terminally
differentiated CD8+ T cells, it is possible that in ME/CFS
the cells are rapidly driven through this intermediate stage to
terminal differentiation and are then lost by cell death. The
study design did not allow us to determine the interaction
between the enhanced MAIT cell compartment and the altered
overall T cell differentiation status: this can be addressed in
future studies. The driver behind the faster transition towards
terminal differentiation could be ongoing antigenic stimulation,
possibly due to persistent viral infection or autoimmunity. The
reduced effector memory T cell populations in PWME may in
part explain the increased susceptibility to infection which is
commonly reported in ME/CFS.
The proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were normal in
PWME. However, in MS patients there was a significant skew
towards increased proportions of CD4+ T cells, lower CD8+ T
cells and therefore a raised CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio. Previously,
there have been mixed reports in PWME, with increased (54) or
decreased (55, 56) CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios observed, although
heterogeneity is commonly reported and may be confounded by
CMV infection status.
In summary, in a large cohort of very carefully phenotyped
people living with ME/CFS, we have observed significant
differences in peripheral T lymphocyte phenotypes but have
been unable to confirm previous reports of distorted NK cell
phenotype or function. Importantly, we excluded from this
study individuals with evidence of ongoing acute infection,
those with obvious comorbidities and those with a history
of taking immunomodulatory medications. We have also
confirmed that CMV seropositivity has a major impact on the
phenotype and function of NK cells and T cells, underlining
the paramount importance of assessing CMV and other herpes
virus infection status in studies of human immune status.
Any of these factors may have confounded the analysis of
previous studies. The most striking finding of this study, the
increased proportion of circulating MAIT cells in people severely
affected by ME/CFS, and the very high proportion of CD8+
MAIT cells in severely affected PWME and in MS patients,
warrants further investigation. This observation also underlines
the importance of including non-fatigued individuals with other
incapacitating illnesses (such as MS patients) in studies of
ME/CFS to control for the physiological effects of reduced levels
of physical activity. Although one might debate whether MS
patients are the most appropriate such group, the very large
immunological database for MS does facilitate benchmarking of
observations and may provide insight into disease pathogenesis
pathways in ME/CFS by comparison with a more extensively
documented disease.
