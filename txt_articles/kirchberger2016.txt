Abstract
Background: Previous studies have indicated that patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who have a history of
peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have different characteristics and poorer outcomes than patients without PAD.
However, data on short-term mortality are conflicting and it is unclear whether patients with PAD have a different
scope of AMI symptoms or differences in pre-hospital delay time (PHDT) compared with patients without PAD. The
objective of this study was to determine the associations between a history of PAD and presenting AMI symptoms,
PHDT and 28-day case fatality in a population-based sample of patients with AMI.
Design: This was an observational study.
Methods: Information on history of PAD was obtained from the patients’ medical records and their AMI symptoms
were assessed by interviews with patients. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the asso-
ciation of PAD with AMI symptoms and 28-day case fatality. A multivariable linear regression model was developed to
examine the relations between PAD and PHDT.
Results: From the 5848 patients with AMI included in this study, 9.8% had a history of PAD. Patients with PAD were
significantly less likely to report chest symptoms (odds ratio (OR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41–0.66) or pain
in the upper left extremity (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54–0.84) than patients without PAD. PAD was significantly related with
longer PHDT in patients <69 years of age (p ¼ 0.0117) and men (p ¼ 0.0104). A significantly higher 28-day case fatality
(OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.47–2.96) was found in patients with PAD compared with patients without PAD.
Conclusions: Patients with PAD should receive comprehensive education on the possibility of atypical AMI symptoms
and the need to call emergency medical services immediately.

Introduction
Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a
systemic manifestation of atherosclerosis classified as a
coronary heart disease risk equivalent in various treat-
ment guidelines.1,2 It has been shown that PAD is asso-
ciated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality and it is frequently linked with acute myocar-
dial infarction (AMI).3–7 The adverse effect of PAD on

syndrome,
including AMI, has been confirmed in some studies,8–13
but other trials have yielded conflicting results.3,14
Although some evidence is available regarding the
influence of PAD on outcomes after AMI, the relations
between PAD and presenting AMI symptoms as well as
the pre-hospital delay time (PHDT) are unclear.
However, both presenting AMI symptoms and PHDT
are crucial factors associated with the timely initiation
of AMI treatment procedures, which affect AMI out-
comes.15–19 Patients who experience atypical symptoms
are more likely to misinterpret these symptoms as not
being of cardiac origin, to underestimate the need to
seek help and to have longer PHDTs.15,20 For instance,
several studies of patients with AMI have indicated that
typical chest pain is less common in patients with dia-
betes21–24 and that patients with diabetes are also more
likely to have a longer PHDT than patients without
diabetes.20,25–28
The objective of this study was to determine the
associations between a history of PAD and presenting
AMI symptoms, PHDT and 28-day case fatality in a
population-based sample of patients with AMI aged
25–84
years
from
the
German
MONICA/KORA
Myocardial Infarction Registry.
Methods
This study was based on data from the population-based
Augsburg
Myocardial
Infarction
Registry,
which
was implemented in 1984 as part of the WHO–
MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in
Cardiovascular Disease) project. After the termination
of MONICA in 1995, the registry became part of the
framework of KORA (Cooperative Health Research in
the Region of Augsburg). Since 1984, all coronary
deaths and non-fatal AMI in the 25–74-year-old study
population in the city of Augsburg and the two adjacent
counties (about 600,000 inhabitants) have been continu-
ously registered.29 In 2009, the age range of participants
was extended to 84 years. Since 2001, the diagnostic
criteria of the European Society of Cardiology and
American College of Cardiology were used for case iden-
tification, including the assessment of troponin levels.30
Sample
Registered
patients
who
had
an
AMI
between
1 January 2009 and 31 December 2014 and survived
longer than 24 hours after hospital admission were
included in the present analysis. From the initial 5863
patients, we excluded 15 patients with missing informa-
tion on PAD. The final analysis consisted of 5848
patients (4061 men, 1787 women) with AMI aged
25–84 years.
Data collection
Data were collected by personal interview and/or
review of medical records. Information on the history
of PAD was extracted from medical records. The fol-
lowing potential confounding variables were collected
from medical records: AMI type (ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment eleva-
tion myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), bundle branch
block), revascularization treatment (thrombolysis, per-
cutaneous
coronary
intervention,
coronary
artery
bypass surgery), number of days in hospital, history
of angina pectoris, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, dia-
betes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal fail-
ure, heart failure and previous percutaneous coronary
intervention (yes/no). Body mass index was determined
by an assessment of height and weight during the hos-
pital stay. Obesity (yes/no) was defined as body mass
index �30 kg/m2. A summary variable was built indi-
cating the presence of any of the following in-hospital
complications: pulmonary oedema, cardiac arrest, car-
diogenic shock, reinfarction, stroke, bleeding and ven-
tricular tachycardia. The use of emergency medical
services was categorized into ‘EMS use’ and ‘No
EMS use’ (including referral by general practitioner/
other physician and patient self-admission).
Interviews were performed by trained study nurses
using a standardized questionnaire after the patients
had been transferred from the intensive care unit. The
patients were asked for the place/location where the
AMI symptoms were first experienced (home, work,
nursing home, hospital, or a different place) and for
the exact time of symptom onset and arrival at hospital.
PHDT was defined as the time from symptom onset to
arrival at hospital. The patient-reported information on
arrival at hospital was validated using the admission
data from the emergency department. For the analysis,
the place of AMI event was dichotomized into ‘at
home’ or ‘not at home’. The initial question about
AMI symptoms was related to the presence of chest
pain,
or
feelings
of
pressure
or
tightness.
Subsequently, the patients were asked whether they
had experienced any other symptoms and complaints.
If they agreed, they were queried about the occurrence
of
12
additional
symptoms.
Patients
were
asked
whether they were married (yes/no), whether they had
ever smoked or had stopped smoking (current smoker/
ex-smoker/never smoked), or whether they had had a
stroke (yes/no). Education was requested using four
different response options reflecting the national educa-
tional system. The variable was dichotomized into
lower level (9 years of school education) and higher
level school education (>9 years of school education).

Data analysis
The relationship between PAD and presenting symp-
toms was examined using multivariable logistic regres-
sion modelling. For each symptom, a multivariable
logistic regression model was developed with the
respective symptom (yes/no) serving as the dependent
variable and PAD included as an independent variable.
To correct for multiple testing, the level of significance
was adapted to p < 0.0039 according to Bonferroni. In
addition to age and sex, potential confounding vari-
ables that showed a significant (p < 0.05) association
with PAD in the bivariate analyses (Table 1) were
included in the model. Stratified analyses according to
sex and age group ( < 69 vs. �69 years) were carried out
only for chest symptoms and pain in the left upper
extremity. For the logistic regression analyses, patients
with missing data in any of the covariables were
excluded, resulting in a sample size of 5403 patients.
The association between PAD and PHDT was exam-
ined using multivariable linear regression modelling.
The exclusion of patients who had an AMI in hospital
or who had missing covariables led to a sample size of
4986. As the PHDT regression residuals were not nor-
mally distributed, the PHDT was logarithmized as the
dependent variable. The analysis was performed in
three steps: first, the crude association was calculated;
second, the model was adjusted for age and sex; and
third, a fully adjusted model was developed. Stratified
analyses
according
to
AMI
type
(STEMI
vs.
NSTEMI), sex and age group (<69 vs. �69 years)
were carried out.
The relationship between PAD and 28-day case
fatality was examined using logistic regression model-
ling with 28-day case fatality as the dependent variable
(n ¼ 5370). Again, an unadjusted model, a model
adjusted for age and sex, and a fully adjusted model
were calculated. Stratified analyses according to sex
and age group (<69 vs. �69 years) were carried out.
In all the multivariable regression models the inter-
action between age and sex was tested in the full
models, but yielded no significant result.
Results
The sample consisted of 5848 patients (69.4% men)
with a mean age of 67.0 � 11.6 years (median 69
years). Of these, 570 patients (9.8%) had a history of
PAD. As shown in Table 1, patients with PAD differed
significantly from those without PAD with respect to a
number of characteristics.
Presenting symptoms
The multivariable logistic regression models demon-
strated that patients with PAD were significantly less
likely to report chest symptoms or pain in the upper left
extremity than patients without PAD, whereas other
presenting
symptoms
did
not
significantly
differ
between these groups (Table 2). Chest symptoms were
also less common in patients with PAD in the sub-
groups of younger (<69 years) patients (odds ratio
(OR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32–0.73),
patients �69 years (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41–0.73), men
(OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.40–0.70) and women (OR 0.48,
95% CI 0.31–0.75). Subgroup analyses confirmed the
trend for a lower likelihood of pain in the upper left
extremity in patients with PAD compared with patients
without PAD, but did not reach the adjusted signifi-
cance level of p < 0.0039. In the age group <69 years,
patients with PAD had a 67% lower likelihood (95%
CI 0.47–0.96) of experiencing pain in the upper left
extremity than their counterparts; in the age group
�69 years the OR was 0.66 (95% CI 0.50–0.88), in
men 0.72 (95% CI 0.55–0.93) and in women 0.54
(95% CI 0.35–0.84).
Pre-hospital delay time
In the linear regression analysis, the results for the
total sample showed a trend for a positive relation
between PHDT and history of PAD, but without
statistical significance. By contrast, a positive associ-
ation was found in the subgroups of patients aged
<69
years
and
men,
which
remained
significant
after adjustment for potential confounders. The sig-
nificant
positive
association
in
the
subgroup
of
patients with STEMI found in the unadjusted and
minimally adjusted models did not remain significant
in the fully adjusted model (Table 3).
28-day case fatality
In the total sample, a significantly higher risk of
death was found for people with PAD, which attenu-
ated with increasing adjustment for covariables from
an OR of 2.65 (95% CI 2.04–3.64) in the unadjusted
analysis to an OR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.47–2.96) in the
fully
adjusted
model
(Table
4).
Higher
odds
of
death were also observed in all subgroup analysis
according to age and sex, but were not significant
in the women. The highest risk for patients with
PAD was found in the subgroup of people younger
than 69 years, who had a 3.21-fold risk of death
(95% CI 1.61–6.37) compared with their counterparts
without PAD in the fully adjusted logistic regression
model.

 Discussion
In our study sample we found that AMI patients with a
history of PAD were less likely to experience typical
AMI symptoms such as chest symptoms and pain in
the upper left extremity and had a significantly higher
28-day
case
fatality
than
patients
without
PAD.
Subgroup analysis revealed a significant positive asso-
ciation between PAD and PHDT in people younger
than 69 years and in men.
Overall, our study confirmed the previously reported
prevalence of PAD of around 8–12% in patients with
acute coronary syndrome.6,7,13,31 Consistent with other
studies, the patients with PAD were older and more
likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension, dia-
betes and stroke.7,8,9,11
PAD emerged as a significant risk factor to present
without the two most typical AMI symptoms of chest
symptoms and pain in the upper left extremity. The
reasons for this finding may be similar to those dis-
cussed for patients with diabetes: people may have a
concomitant autonomic neuropathy and, as a conse-
quence, their perception of ischaemic pain may be con-
siderably
diminished
or
completely
blocked.22,32
Unfortunately, the absence of chest pain was found
to be a risk factor for delayed initiation of treatment 20,
a lower likelihood of being aggressively treated with
acute reperfusion therapies, cardiac medication and
invasive cardiac procedures23, and higher in-hospital
and long-term mortality16,33–35 Thus AMI patients
with PAD are at risk of delayed and less effective treat-
ment, which may result in reduced survival.
Irrespective of atypical symptom presentation, PAD
was found to be related with longer PHDT. This asso-
ciation was not significant (p ¼ 0.0608) in the total
sample, but was significant in the subgroups of younger
patients and men. These findings may indicate a
reduced awareness in patients regarding their own
risk for developing an AMI and a lack of knowledge
of the appropriate behaviour if cardiac problems are
suspected.
Our study confirmed the findings from previous stu-
dies reporting that PAD is an independent risk factor of
short-term mortality.8–12 Interestingly, in this study the
patients younger than 69 years showed the highest risk
not only for 28-day case fatality, but also for an absence
of chest pain and delayed hospital admission. It may be
hypothesized that patients who have both AMI and

 PAD early in life are a special multi-morbidity group
with
a
severely
damaged
cardiovascular
system.
Surprisingly, none of the previous studies on the associ-
ation between PAD and short-term mortality provided
age-stratified results3,8–12,14 that could be compared with
our findings. Thus further research is needed to provide
a meaningful interpretation of our results.
Although the need to consider and investigate the
risks of coronary heart disease in women has been high-
lighted in the last decade,36 differences between men and
women in terms of PAD have only rarely been investi-
gated37. In our study, among both sexes, patients with
PAD had a higher risk for short-term case fatality, but
the OR was only significant in men, which may be due to
the small sample size of women. Subherwal et al.3 found
comparable rates of short-term mortality in 7029 men
and women with PAD and AMI, but higher long-term
risks for men. In a smaller sample of 394 patients with
AMI and peripheral vascular disease (history of claudi-
cation, stroke or transient ischaemic attack), Guerrero
et al.9 reported an almost three-fold higher 1-year mor-
tality risk for men compared with women.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has
examined AMI symptoms, PHDT and 28-day case
fatality in a population-based sample of patients with
AMI and a history of PAD. Stratification of the results
by age group and sex provided additional relevant
information. The strengths of this study were the
sample of patients consecutively admitted to hospital
with validated AMI, the inclusion of patients in a
defined area and according to defined criteria, the com-
prehensive collection of data on socio-demographic
characteristics, risk factors, prior diseases and in-
hospital
treatment,
and
the
standardized
patient-
reported assessment of symptoms soon after the AMI.
The limitations of this study include the restriction
to patients younger than 85 years. As our study
excluded pre-hospital deaths and patients who died

Downloaded from 
 within 24 hours after admission, which make up about
30% of all cases of AMI, our finding that PAD doubles
the 28-day case fatality risk may underestimate the real
magnitude of the problem among the AMI population.
The history of PAD was obtained from medical records
and was not confirmed by other diagnostic procedures.
Multiple-vessel coronary artery disease may be related
to case fatality, but was not considered because the
KORA AMI Registry database does not include this
information. The results regarding sex differences
should be interpreted with caution because of the
small number of women in this study, leading to a
potential over-adjustment in the regression models.
Although a number of factors that may affect PHDT
were investigated, we were not able to consider the geo-
graphical distance to hospital.
Our study has confirmed that, among patients with
AMI, those with a history of PAD are a very vulnerable
group who requires specific attention by all actors within
the health care system. Similar to AMI patients with
diabetes, patients with PAD may experience atypical
symptoms, have delayed hospital admission and reduced
short-term survival. However, in contrast with the
increased risks related with diabetes, both the public
and health care providers still lack awareness of the
risk factors associated with PAD.38,39 It remains unclear
whether patients diagnosed with PAD are aware of their
increased risk of AMI. The results of this study indicate
that the comprehensive education of PAD patients –
specifically of younger patients and men – about the
possibility of a lack of typical pain symptoms in the
case of an AMI and the benefits of immediate hospital
admission may be useful to improve post-AMI survival.
Further research on these issues is needed.
