SUMMARY
Background: More than half of the global population 
 
currently lives in cities, with an increasing trend for further 
urbanization. Living in cities is associated with increased 
population density, traffic noise and pollution, but also 
with better access to health care and other commodities. 
Methods: This review is based on a selective literature 
search, providing an overview of the risk factors for 
 
mental illness in urban centers.
Results: Studies have shown that the risk for serious 
 
mental illness is generally higher in cities compared to 
rural areas. Epidemiological studies have associated 
growing up and living in cities with a considerably higher 
risk for schizophrenia. However, correlation is not 
 
causation and living in poverty can both contribute to and 
result from impairments associated with poor mental 
health. Social isolation and discrimination as well as 
 
poverty in the neighborhood contribute to the mental 
health burden while little is known about specific inter 
-
actions between such factors and the built environment. 
Conclusion: Further insights on the interaction between 
spatial heterogeneity of neighborhood resources and 
socio-ecological factors is warranted and requires inter-
disciplinary research.

rbanization is one of the main health-relevant 
changes humanity is facing in our time, and will 
be facing in the coming decades (1). Today more than 
50 percent of the global  
population is living in cities; by 
2050, this rate will increase to nearly 70 percent with 
more than 50 percent of the urban population living in 
cities of over 500 000 inhabitants (2). With growing 
 
urbanization, more and more people are exposed to risk 
factors originating from the urban social (e.g. poverty) 
or physical environment (e.g. traffic noise), con 
-
tributing to increased stress, which in turn is negatively 
associated with mental health. By contrast, cities 
 
provide better access to health care, employment, and 
education. The balance between those factors that are 
deleterious and those that are protective for mental 
health calls for a better understanding of the interaction 
between city living and mental health. 
Methods
We performed a selective literature review that 
 
synthesizes the current evidence for urban population 
mental health. We mainly included meta-analyses and 
quantitative 
studies 
presenting 
evidence 
from 
 
rural-urban or inner-urban differences in mental 
 
disorders. Qualitative studies were excluded as well as 
studies in which mental health was used to predict other 
outcomes. Results are interpreted based on the theories 
by Stokols (3), Galea et al. (4), and Gruebner et al. (5) 
with particular consideration of socio-ecological 
 
environments and their associations with mental health. 
Results
Rural-urban differences in mental health
The risk for some major mental illnesses (e.g. anxiety, 
psychotic, mood, or addictive disorders) is generally 
higher in cities (e.g. 6). Studies on anxiety disorders 
(including posttraumatic stress disorder, distress, anger, 
and paranoia) found higher rates in urban versus rural 
areas in several Latin American and Asian countries 
(7–10). The same was true for psychotic disorders (e.g. 
schizophrenia) in China (11) and in large urban areas in 
Germany (12, 13). In a Danish study, the risk for 
schizophrenia was more than twofold for individuals 
who had spent their first 15 years in a major city versus 
those who had grown up in rural areas (14) (see the 
Table for a selective summary). Epidemiological 
studies further confirmed that the risk for schizophrenia 
was higher in people who grew up in cities (versus rural 
areas), thereby exhibiting a dose-response relationship:

The more time spent in an urban environment as a 
child, the higher the risk for schizophrenia as an adult 
(15–23).
Likewise, mood disorders were observed more fre-
quently among residents of large cities in Germany 
(12). In contrast, rural residents in China were more 
likely to have depressive disorders (8, 24). This was 
also true in a study on common perinatal mental 
 
disorders (depression and substance use) in women in 
Vietnam (25). Addictive disorders (for instance exces 
-
sive use of massive multiplayer online role-playing 
games [MMORPG]) was mainly found among young 
adult university graduates living alone in urban France 
(26). In contrast, rural residents were more likely to 
have alcohol dependence than were urban residents, as 
shown in a study in China (8).
Inner-urban differences and mental health
Urban social environments:
Social risk factors for mental health in cities include 
● concentrations of low socio-economic status 
(SES) (e.g. education levels, income), 
● low social capital (e.g. social support, efficacy), 
● or social segregation (e.g. perceived minority 
status, ethnic group membership) (27–34). 
SES is by far the most studied risk factor and has 
been consistent in its association with mental health. 
For example, living in poor or deprived neighborhoods 
is associated with greater risk of poor mental health 
(e.g. depression, schizophrenia) versus living in richer 
neighborhoods (27, 29, 33, 35–40, e1–e4). The associ-
ation between familial liability and mental illness was 
stronger in more deprived neighborhoods, with 
 
neighborhood variables mediating urbanicity effects in 
Turkey (38). In another study, adverse conditions as-
sociated with very poor neighborhoods in slums were 
associated with mental health disorders in India (39). 
Persons within disadvantaged areas may have more 
 
difficulties building and sustaining supportive social 
 
relationships and may have increasing susceptibility to 
mental illness. Evidence also exists for socially 
 
disorganized neighborhoods in which people feel inse-
cure and frequently experience violence (e1, e2), con-
tributing to increased trauma exposure with related 
consequences for mental health (40, e3, e4). 
However, it is important to keep in mind that corre-
lation is not causation. Selective migration may lead to 
worse population health in those neighborhoods that 
movers leave behind and to better health at the desti-
nation, as movers often have better health status (e5, 
e6). 
Research also indicated a reciprocal effect, that is, 
people who had poor health or who experienced diffi-
cult life events (e.g. relationship breakdown, job loss) 
were more likely to move to more deprived areas 
 
versus others (e7, e8), e.g., due to low, affordable rents. 
For example, increased schizophrenia risk was reported 
for living in an urban environment five years after 
 
disease onset (14). However, this effect did not fully 
explain increased schizophrenia rates in inner cities, 
because numerically, effects of urbanization early in 
life were somewhat larger, suggesting at least two 
mechanisms: First, growing up in cities has an effect on 
illness risk, and second, higher amounts of people with 
health problems move to urban areas (17). 
Living in socially deprived neighborhoods itself may 
have a heritable component (ranging from a 65% 
 
elevated variance in a sibling study to 41% in a twin 
study) (e9). The authors assume that genetic suscep 
-
tibility for schizophrenia predicts subsequent residence 
in individuals with schizophrenia. They found that 
 
effects of population density on schizophrenia risk 
 
disappeared when known familial risk factors were 
 
accounted for, and assumed that in relatives of schizo-
phrenia subjects, familial or specifically genetic risk 
factors are associated with cognitive functions, which 
causally contribute to living in poverty (e9). However, 
such familial and even genetic risk factors may be inde-
pendent of cognitive style and rather include visible 
 
minority status. 
Indeed, schizophrenia risk is substantially increased 
in migrants, not only in the first generation exposed to 
transitional stressors, but also in subsequent gener-
ations (e10). Moreover, psychosis rates are particularly 
high when patients belong to a visible minority (e.g., 
people from West Africa and the Caribbean in London, 
Moroccans in Den Haag) (34) and when the ethnic 
 
density in the neighborhood is low. These findings 
 
suggest that social exclusion and discrimination play an 
important role in the development of schizophrenia 
(e11).
In turn, neighborhoods characterized by higher 
 
social support and collective efficacy may buffer per-
ceived stress through support networks promoting 
mental health (e12, e13). In addition, neighborhood 
 
social support networks may also contribute to social 
norms and practices that have been found to be protec-
tive for substance use disorders or suicide attempts 
(30–32). 
Living in neighborhoods characterized by residential 
ethnic segregation is associated with greater risk of de-
pression and anxiety, versus living in less segregated 
neighborhoods (29, e3, e14). Our research group 
 
investigated the differential contribution of poverty and 
minority status at the community level on individual-
level mental health, controlled by individual-level 
 
differences in SES and migration in an inner city popu-
lation in Berlin, Germany (27) (Figure). 
We found that individual-level mental distress in 
 
migrants was associated with community-level poverty, 
independent of individual-level SES, in that, roughly, a 
10% increase in the percentage of residents receiving 
public welfare in the neighborhood corresponded to an 
increase of 8 points on the GHQ-28 (General Health 
Questionnaire). 
We noted that the effect of poverty was more pro-
nounced in migrants versus native citizens, in that a 
10% increase in the proportion of residents with a 
 
migration background accounted for an additional 5 
points on the GHQ-28. Our observations suggest that 
122

 M E D I C I N E
the high level of mental distress in migrants was largely 
driven by community-level SES, beyond the effects of 
individual resources, emphasizing the need for targeted 
interventions (27). 
There is also cumulative evidence that urban resi-
dents belonging to a minority group including those 
with a migration background carry an increased risk for 
depression and psychosis (e15–e18). Remarkably, 
 
social support among minorities appears to be an im-
portant protective factor, while having visible minority 
status as a resident in neighborhoods with low numbers 
of ethnic minorities (“lower ethnic density”) was 
 
associated with increased rates of e.g. schizophrenia 
(34). Such effects may well be due to increased 
 
discrimination in segregated neighborhoods and are 
supported by neurobiological studies emphasizing the 
role of social isolation stress in the development of 
mental disorders (e11, e19).

be found for the urban physical environment that

● higher rates of pollution (e.g., air, water), 
● noise pollution (e.g., traffic)
● specific urban designs (e.g. tall buildings that may 
be perceived as oppressive), 
● or more physical threats (e.g., accidents, 
 
violence), 
thereby likely increasing stress levels with negative 
effects on mental health (5, e20–e25). Research indi-
cates that urban air, water, and noise pollution can have 
substantial effects on the mental health of urban 
 
populations. For example, living close to major streets 
or airports increases exposure to traffic noise and 
 
pollution and is associated with higher levels of stress 
and aggression (e20, e26–e28). 
Adjusted by SES, age, and type of residential area, 
one study in Germany found that those who were 
highly annoyed by road traffic, had a 1.8-fold  
(women) 
and 2.5-fold  
(men) increased risk for impaired mental 
health (e29). Urban light exposure may further 
 
influence the circadian rhythm and change sleeping 
patterns with known consequences for mental well-
being (e30). 
Urban design exhibits associations with population 
mental health (4, e22, e23, e31–e41). For example, 
greater access to green space and better walkability was

associated with less depression and enhanced physical 
activity that may promote health (e32–e34). Fur-
thermore, the recreational aspects of well-maintained 
urban green and blue spaces are apparently associated 
with the mental well-being of urban populations (e33, 
e42, e43). Urban green and blue features additionally 
have the capability to buffer urban heat island effects 
and to reduce heat stress (e44). Moreover, urban street 
canopy can reduce the “oppressive” effects of tall 
buildings (e22, e23). 
In addition, urban density (as opposed to sprawl) has 
been associated with better mental health as it 
 
comprises better access to resources (e.g. parks, play-
grounds, health-, and social care) (e45). 
In contrast, less green space may indicate more traf-
fic noise and worse access to neighborhood resources, 
which may lead to low housing rents attracting low 
SES groups. Work in the field of environmental justice 
may offer more insights into these relationships and 
may help further promote mental health in urban areas. 
Future challenges
Urban neighborhoods play a particular role in shaping 
urban population health due to their unique socio-
 
ecological environments constituting both risk and 
health promoting factors (6, 12, 36, e46). Six key 
 
challenges and opportunities for future research direc-
tions need to be addressed:
First: there remains much we need to know about 
the functional relationships between city living or up-
bringing and mental health problems in urban popu-
lations (19–22, 37, e47–e49). Research would benefit 
from more longitudinal studies facilitating the analysis 
of causal relationships between the duration of expo-
sure to inner-urban socio-ecological factors and mental 
health.
Second: we do not know much about the associ-
ations of neighborhood resources (e.g. green spaces) 
with different dimensions of mental health. Although 
studies have looked into different mental health out-
comes, they have not been systematically assessed 
within the same contexts, that is, whether e.g. green 
spaces are associated with similar effects across mental 
health dimensions. 
Third: we also do not know much about socio-
demographic differences in the relationship between 
access to neighborhood resources and mental health 
(19). Socio-demographic groups may not have similar 
access to these resources and may be disproportionately 
distributed benefiting e.g. more affluent populations, 
which is increasingly recognized as an environmental 
justice issue (e50). Including these issues in the context 
of urban mental health may help for more sustainable 
distributions of balanced resources.
 
Fourth: our understanding of moderators (e.g. social 
or ethnic segregation) to help explain differences be-
tween groups in mental health is also limited (27, 28, 
30). In this context, breaking up social and ethnic 
segregation and discrimination appears to be warranted 
to improve living conditions and reduce social 
 
isolation. Furthermore, both heterogeneous and homo-
geneous neighborhoods (e.g. low SES) may have 
negative associations with individual level mental 
health such that respective effects can only be assessed 
in multilevel-adjusted research studies. In addition, we 
do not know whether the risk of mental health problems 
is reduced in people if they think they have the option 
to move away. 
We also do not know much about the spatial 
 
heterogeneity in the association of neighborhood re-
sources with mental health across urban neighbor-
hoods. High unemployment rates in one neighborhood 
may have an effect also on adjacent neighborhoods 
(30). For example, high unemployment rates are associ-
ated with higher substance abuse (e51) and may affect 
drug use in neighboring parks or facilities, even though 
unemployment (or substance use) rates are low there. 
Fifth: our knowledge on synergies between inter-
ventions is limited, so that we do not know much about 
the mental health effects of policies that were not 
 
specifically designed for improving mental health of 
urban populations (e.g. introducing street trees, 
 
reduced-traffic areas). Systematic evaluations of inter-
ventions that have worked in other settings and their 
 
effects on urban mental health are still scarce in the 
 
literature, especially in developing cities of resource 
poor countries (e52, e53). 
Sixth: interdisciplinary research between architec-
ture, city planning, epidemiology, geography, neuro 
-
sciences, and sociology are crucial to better under-
stand to which extent urban socio-ecological environ-
ments affect population mental health. Such an ap-
proach may also identify populations who lack the 
“urban advantage” and who are at risk for psycho-
pathology.
Conclusions
A series of studies exhibit interaction between 
urbanici 
ty, the socio-ecological environment, and 
mental health (19, 27). Research would benefit from 
more longitudinal studies focusing on both rural-
urban and  
inner-urban causes and distributions of 
mental health. 
More in-depth knowledge about different dimen-
sions of mental health disorders across diverse socio-
demographic groups might shed light on the distribu-
tions of these disorders and guide us in better devel-
oping health promoting urban designs. Knowledge 
on moderators from the socio-ecological environ-
ment, on the spatial heterogeneity of neighborhood 
resources, and their associations with mental health 
within and across neighborhoods will help to eluci-
date the mechanisms linking urban environments to 
mental health.
