Two decades of research indicate causal associations between social
relationships and mortality, but important questions remain as to
how social relationships affect health, when effects emerge, and
how long they last. Drawing on data from four nationally represen-
tative longitudinal samples of the US population, we implemented
an innovative life course design to assess the prospective association
of both structural and functional dimensions of social relationships
(social integration, social support, and social strain) with objectively
measured biomarkers of physical health (C-reactive protein, systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass
index) within each life stage, including adolescence and young,
middle, and late adulthood, and compare such associations across life
stages. We found that a higher degree of social integration was
associated with lower risk of physiological dysregulation in a dose–
response manner in both early and later life. Conversely, lack of social
connections was associated with vastly elevated risk in specific life
stages. For example, social isolation increased the risk of inflammation
by the same magnitude as physical inactivity in adolescence, and the
effect of social isolation on hypertension exceeded that of clinical risk
factors such as diabetes in old age. Analyses of multiple dimensions of
social relationships within multiple samples across the life course pro-
duced consistent and robust associations with health. Physiological
impacts of structural and functional dimensions of social relationships
emerge uniquely in adolescence and midlife and persist into old age.

A
defining characteristic of human society is that individual lives
are intertwined through social relationships. Full social partici-
pation is such a fundamental human need that research since the
1900s has found the lack of social connections increases the odds of
death by at least 50% (1, 2). When multidimensional assessments of
social relationships were considered, the odds of mortality increased
by 91% among the socially isolated (2). The magnitude of this effect
is comparable to that of smoking and exceeds those of many other
known risk factors of mortality, such as obesity or physical inactivity
(2, 3). Although much evidence has accrued on the strong causal
associations between social relationships and mortality as well as
other health outcomes (4–7), important questions remain as to how
social relationships affect health, when these effects emerge, and how
long they last (8).
Studies of social, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms
underlying the social relationship gradient in health have shed light
on the first question (9–11). It is less clear, however, what biological
mechanisms may be at play. Recent research on the biology of aging
emphasizes the essential role of physiological stress response and
regulation across multiple bodily systems in shaping longevity (12,
13). Although social relationship gradients in health and longevity
(Fig. 1, path A) and physiological determinants of mortality (Fig. 1,
path B) have been widely documented, these separate bodies of
research have yet to be fully integrated. We have yet to determine
whether social relationship differentials in longevity arise from a
biological process in which social experiences “get under the skin” to
alter physiological regulatory systems (Fig. 1, path C) (4).
Laboratory research on rats using experimental designs demon-
strated that social isolation and hypervigilance increase the incidence
of mammary tumors (14, 15) and compromise innate immune re-
sponse to stress (16). In humans, deficits in social relationships such
as social isolation or low social support can similarly lead to chronic
activation of immune, neuroendocrine, and metabolic systems that
lie in the pathways, leading to cardiovascular, neoplastic, and other
common aging-related diseases (5, 8, 17, 18). Previous non-
experimental studies using observational data from human subjects
tentatively support this proposition by documenting associations
between social relationship measures such as social integration and
support with biomarkers of inflammation (5, 8, 18), metabolic syn-
drome (18, 19), and cumulative dysregulation indicated by allostatic
load (20). However, because these associations are largely based on
cross-sectional data, they cannot be assumed to represent underlying
causal relationships. Additional prospective longitudinal studies are
needed to better address bias due to potential confounding factors
and reverse causality, further explaining path C.
Examining how social and biological processes unfold and
interact as individuals age is a critical step in advancing scientific
explanations of the emergence and progression of diseases. A life
course perspective, represented by the horizontal arrow D as a
developmental trajectory, has not been fully brought to bear on
this question. This perspective may offer considerable leverage
by linking physical risks to social exposures that occur over time
across multiple developmental stages from early to late life. The
vast majority of biosocial research to date on this association has
Significance
Although much evidence has accrued in research over the past
20 years on the strong causal associations between social rela-
tionships and health and longevity, important gaps remain in our
understanding of the mechanisms, timing, and duration of these
associations. This study integrates social and biological disciplin-
ary perspectives and research to examine how social relation-
ships “get under the skin” to affect physiological well-being as
individuals age. By combining data from and harmonizing mea-
surement across four large nationally representative, population-
based, contemporary surveys using an innovative longitudinal life
course design, this study provides previously unidentified evi-
dence on the biological and life course mechanisms linking social
relationship patterns with health. As such, our findings advance
explanations of the emergence and progression of diseases across
the human life span.

 focused on older adults for whom morbidity and mortality rates
are high (8, 21, 22). However, early life social experiences may be
biologically embedded at that time, shown by an increasing body
of research linking childhood disadvantage and maltreatment to
increased likelihood of exaggerated biological stress response
and, in turn, higher risks of inflammation and cardiovascular
disease throughout adulthood (23–26).
Relationship deficits—such as social isolation, lack of support,
or high strain—are alternative forms of social adversity that can
create chronic stress by continuous exposure to chains of risk
that accumulate over the life course (27, 28). Individuals who
experienced early adversity are subject to multiple and longer
durations of stress exposures and more prone to inflammatory
and stress-related diseases as they age. At the same time, the
emergence of chronic diseases usually takes many decades due to
the long latency after the initial risk exposures (29). Therefore,
extensive longitudinal data and analyses are imperative to un-
derstanding how the connection of social relationships and lon-
gevity unfolds over the human life span. Little empirical research
exists that depicts this lifelong process partly because data that
extend sufficiently over long periods of the life course, as
depicted in trajectory D, are exceedingly rare.
This study addresses the aforementioned questions, integrates
previous research on social relationships and health across disciplines,
and tests a new longitudinal model of how social relationships matter
for physiological health across the human life span. We make three
unique contributions that shed new light on path C across trajectory
D. First, using data from an array of nationally representative lon-
gitudinal samples of the US population, we implement an innovative
life course design that begins at the earliest developmental stage
(adolescence) in which physiological consequences of key social re-
lationship patterns begin to manifest and traces subsequent life stages
(young, middle, late adulthood) to depict the life-long process
of stress response cascades that such relationship patterns initiate.
The data come from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
to Adult Health (Add Health) to capture adolescence and young
adulthood, the National Survey of Midlife Development in the
United States (MIDUS) for middle adulthood, and both the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Social Life, Health,
and Aging Project (NSHAP) for late adulthood. The use of multiple
large, population-based samples in an integrative design allows us to
assess linkages between social relationships and health for each life
stage. It also offers an unprecedented fuller view of age variations in
such linkages than any previous study of a particular sample or single
life stage alone. Second, this study uses comprehensive and refined
measurements of social relationships that encompass two primary
dimensions that may differentially influence physical health at
different stages of the life course. It assesses measures of social
integration to capture the structural–quantitative dimension and
measures of social support and strain to capture the functional–
qualitative dimension, using age-appropriate conceptualizations of
these domains for each life stage. Third, the study examines
multiple objectively measured biomarkers or endophenotypes in-
cluding inflammation (C-reactive protein, CRP), cardiovascular
function (hypertension), and energy metabolism (overall obesity
and abdominal obesity) to capture key physiological mechanisms
underlying common diseases of aging and longevity (12).
Results
Our results indicate that social integration is related to better
physiological functioning and lower risks of physical disorders in a
dose–response fashion across life stage samples. Fig. 2 illustrates that
individuals with a higher degree of social connectedness at prior
points in time have lower predicted values of all four markers. De-
scriptive statistics on biomarkers, sample characteristics, and cova-
riates are shown in Tables S1–S3, respectively. Adjusting for age, sex,
and race, the negative associations of social integration with poor
physical functioning were statistically significant for log-transformed
CRP [log(CRP)] and systolic blood pressure (BP) in all three life
stages shown, including adolescence and young and late adulthood.
Additional analyses with diastolic BP revealed qualitatively similar
results, so we presented results of systolic BP because of its clinical
relevance for subsequent vascular and other chronic disease events
and mortality as individuals age (30). Social integration gradients in
waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) were also
evident across samples, but the associations were significant only in
adolescence. The association between social integration index and
BMI estimated in the late adulthood HRS sample was in the op-
posite direction as expected but did not reach statistical significance
to warrant substantive explanations. The results from the NSHAP
analyses were similar to those from the HRS and were thus omitted
from Fig. 2. We focused instead on the longitudinal change model
results from NSHAP below.
In addition to lower risks of poor functioning, more socially in-
tegrated individuals also had lower odds of deleterious physical
outcomes that are of clinical significance. Table 1 shows that in the
basic models adjusting for age, sex, and race, a higher social in-
tegration index score was related to a 25% [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.74,
95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.57–0.97, P = 0.031] and 14%
(OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.78–0.94, P = 0.001) lower odds of elevated
inflammation in adolescence and young adulthood (Add Health) and
late adulthood (HRS), respectively. The estimated OR for the
NSHAP sample at baseline also shows a negative association
resulting in a 40% (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37–0.95, P = 0.029)
lower odds of inflammation. Adjusting for covariates reduced some
but not all of these associations, indicating that the physiological
effects of social integration are partially mediated by socioeconomic
status, health risk behavior (i.e., smoking, physical activity, obesity),
and prior chronic disease. To put the magnitude of the effects in
perspective, additional analyses revealed that social isolation raised
the odds of high inflammation (OR = 1.27, P = 0.05) to a compa-
rable degree with physical inactivity (OR = 1.21, P = 0.05) (Add
Health analyses).
The results for other biomarkers show large age variations in
their associations with the social integration index. The pro-
tective effects of social integration were particularly large in
adolescence (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.39–0.68, P = 0.000)
against abdominal obesity and particularly salient in old age

 against hypertension. In the basic model, the OR estimated for
the HRS sample shows a significant 13% lower odds of hy-
pertension (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.78–0.89, P = 0.013) at follow-
up for those with a higher mean social integration level earlier
in time. The corresponding estimates for the NSHAP sample
from the longitudinal residual change model show a 54% re-
duction in the odds of developing hypertension (OR = 0.46,
95% CI = 0.25–0.85, P = 0.014) over time for those with a
higher baseline social integration score.
In both studies, these associations remained robust after
adjusting for all of the other covariates in the full models. We
note that with an interval of 6 y in the elderly NSHAP sample
who already had a high prevalence of hypertension at baseline, a
change in risk of this size was substantial. Specifically, the effect
of social isolation (OR = 2.42, P = 0.007) on hypertension risk
exceeded the effect of diabetes (OR = 1.49, P = 0.059), a well-
known risk factor for hypertension at older ages. The associa-
tions of social integration with overall obesity are significant in
both early and late life. The OR estimates indicate strong pro-
tective effects of social connectedness against obesity in adoles-
cence in the basic model and also at old age in the change
models estimated for the NSHAP sample.
We did not find any significant results regarding the social in-
tegration–biomarker associations in the MIDUS sample, which
may be due to empirical and substantive factors. Compared with
other studies, the MIDUS sample with biomarkers is more ho-
mogeneous, consisting of mostly white respondents with higher
levels of educational attainment and household income. However,
supplemental analyses restricted to only white respondents with
the other three studies did not change their results. [To further
examine whether the associations between integration and bio-
markers in the MIDUS sample were generalizable, we conducted
parallel analyses using a middle-aged subsample (age 34–74) of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
1999–2006) (31). Consistent with the MIDUS results, higher social
integration among middle-aged NHANES respondents was not
protective against physiological risks.] Therefore, the racial and
socioeconomic (SES) composition of the MIDUS sample is un-
likely to account for its lack of consistency with the other samples.
Further scrutiny of the MIDUS data revealed that ∼80% of the
sample reported weekly family and friend contact, indicating

 higher overall reports of integration than the other-aged samples.
We therefore used a more stringent cutoff for the frequency of
social contact in the MIDUS analysis, but these results continue to
show that the degree of social embeddedness has less variation in
midlife such that the sheer number of social connections does not
differentiate individuals in terms of physical health risks.
We next addressed whether the quality of social relationships
matters for health, given the quality of relationships is not informed
by a count of social ties and interactions. Social support and strain
measures are summarized in Table S2. In general, we found that
perceived social support and strain measures are related to physi-
ological indicators differently from social integration in that asso-
ciations are more modest, nonlinear, and particularly salient for
midadulthood. Most respondents in study samples with available
information on quality of social relationships reported adequate
levels of social support and little strain. Even though variations in the
quality of relationships are small, those who perceived more support
or strain are different from others in both physical functioning and
clinical risk factors. Models including both social integration and
social support and strain show similar results from those including
them separately, suggesting largely independent associations of each
social relationship dimension with biomarkers. The results reported
below thus relate to models of social support and social strain
without the inclusion of social integration.
Fig. 3 illustrated that adjusting for age, sex, and race, those
with high (top quartile) social support at the baseline show sig-
nificantly lower mean values of three markers assessed at the
follow-ups than those with lower social support, including sys-
tolic BP at old age (P = 0.038), WC at young to middle age (P =
0.099) and old age (P = 0.031), and BMI at young to middle age
(P = 0.003). Compared with those with low strain, those with
high (top quartile) strain at the baseline exhibited significantly
higher mean values of CRP at the follow-up in midadulthood
and higher mean values of WC and BMI at the follow-up in both
mid- and late adulthood. Results from the HRS analyses were
similar to the results of the NSHAP analyses and are not shown.
The results for binary outcomes based on clinical thresholds are
summarized in Table S4. In these models, continuous measures of
social support and social strain yielded superior model fit than the
dichotomous measures. Higher social support was associated with
lower odds of abdominal and overall obesity in young to mid-
adulthood (MIDUS sample only). Such effects were moderate in
size and mostly eliminated or explained away by the adjustment of
additional covariates. Higher social strain was predictive of mildly
increased odds of inflammatory response and abdominal obesity in
young to midadulthood and more substantial increases in the odds
of overall obesity in both mid- and late adulthood that persisted
after the adjustment of the full set of covariates.
Discussion
By combining data from four large nationally representative, pop-
ulation-based, contemporary studies using an innovative longitudinal
life course design, this study has provided previously unidentified
causal evidence on the mechanisms linking social relationship pat-
terns with health and longevity across the human life span. Although
the links represented in Fig. 1 have been found to be strong in past
social research that focused on path A, as well as biological research
that focused on path B, our study provided evidence that connects
paths A and B through path C and, for the first time to our knowl-
edge, documented the life course process in which these paths unfold
as depicted in trajectory D.
Our study strengthened support for causal linkages between
social relationships and physical functioning embodied in path C
by improving both the measurement and analyses of these

 linkages. First, our study engaged a more comprehensive set of
measures of relationship characteristics across multiple social life
domains that are specific to each life stage and harmonized
across four nationally representative studies. We also examined
the associations between these relationship indicators and bio-
markers across multiple physiological systems also harmonized
across studies. The common patterns that emerged from the
study of multiple measures of both social exposures and bi-
ological outcomes strongly support the generality of the associ-
ations, indicating social integration protects health and promotes
longevity. Second, the use of longitudinal data for lagged mea-
sures of social exposures in relation to subsequent measures of
biomarkers in all study samples ensured the proper temporal
order in causal relationships underlying the association. Al-
though the lack of repeated longitudinal measures of biomarkers
in three study samples precludes causal inference of the physi-
ological impact of social relationships, the NSHAP study allowed
us to model change in physiological function as an outcome using
two waves of biomarker measurements and hence provided a
more rigorous test of the causal effects of interest. Although we
cannot eliminate the possibility that some prior condition affects
both social relations and physiology, this limitation relates more
to biomarker data measured at one point in time than those that
include repeated biomarker measures over time. We cannot rule
out the potential effect of mortality selection of older or frailer
adults. The results are thus likely conservative regarding the full
range of physiological effects of social relations. Furthermore,
the results are not only consistent across studies included but
also consistent with those obtained in previous research across
diverse samples such as laboratory animals (14–16) and clinical
populations (5) and study designs such as experiments (14–16)
and mortality follow-ups (6–8). They provide robust and uniform
support for the existence and causal nature of path C.
In addition, our study identified the multifaceted links of dif-
ferent dimensions of social relations to physical health. A mea-
surement approach including more than one type of relationship
measure may better represent the multiple pathways by which so-
cial relations affect health (2). By assessing both the structural and
functional dimensions of social relationships, we found that par-
ticular network and support characteristics may have unique in-
fluences on health. Extending previous research, we found that the
links between social embeddedness and better physical functioning,
as well as lower clinically significant disease risks, are exceptionally
strong across most biological markers examined. Greater perceived
quality of network ties was also beneficial for some markers with
more variation across the life course. We further assessed the
quality of social relationships by distinguishing positive and nega-
tive functions of network connections. We found evidence for
social strain as a more significant predictor of (worsening)
physiological outcomes than commonly examined social support
measures hypothesized to improve health. This suggests the
importance of considering psychosocial distress that may arise
from negative social exchanges in future investigations of social
relationships and health links.
The longitudinal life course design that we used in trajectory D
elucidates when and how social integration matters for health
as the aging process unfolds. We found evidence for the early
emergence and persistence of the path C linkage between social
relationships and physical health over the life course. We did not
include the childhood life stage in this study because we focus
more on meaningful social connections beyond familial contexts.
Embeddedness in social networks seems to be especially crit-
ical for health during the formative years of building social
relationships in adolescence and in the later adult years when
the maintenance of social connections are relevant. The robust
findings that social integration during adolescence (and not
during young adulthood) matters for young adult metabolic
and cardiovascular healthy functioning suggest that these early
relationship contexts and connections play a role in predisease
pathways into adulthood. The young adult years are considered
to be the healthy years of the life span, yet adolescent social
connections differentiate health risks in young adults, long be-
fore symptoms or overt signs of disease emerge.
After the busy years of midlife, maintaining social connections
in older adulthood plays a vital role in protecting health. Chronic
conditions naturally increase during late adulthood as part of
the aging process. However, socially embedded older adults ex-
perience fewer disease risks, and our results from the NSHAP
analyses suggest a causal role of social connections in reducing
hypertension and obesity in old age. The deleterious effect of
social isolation, in particular, was estimated to exceed that of
diabetes, a well-known clinical risk factor for many chronic dis-
eases including hypertension. Our findings therefore point to two
life stages when the development and maintenance of social
relationships can be especially critical for reducing future health
risks and, in turn, reducing the high cost and consequences of
chronic disease for individuals, families, and society as a whole.
The age variations we found for these associations also depend
on relationship measures. Whereas the size of social networks
was consistently important to physical health in both early and
late adulthood, network size was not found to be significantly
related to any biomarkers in midadulthood. Our additional
analyses suggest that this is unlikely to be a methodological ar-
tifact. Several substantive explanations are possible. On one
hand, adults in midlife are naturally embedded in multiple social
networks associated with this life stage, including those at work,
in the community, with children and other parents, and aging
parents. Social integration is not a discriminating factor in mid-
life for most adults. On the other hand, these multiple social
connections in midlife are potentially stressful in nature. Prior
research shows that greater role conflict across multiple social
domains and across generations is especially prevalent during this
life stage (32). Therefore, the perceived quality of social rela-
tionships rather than the density of one’s social network may
better capture the link between social ties and health in midlife.
In fact, this conclusion is supported by our finding that social
support and strain, which measured qualitative characteristics of
social connections that are distinct from relationship quantity,
mattered more for physical health in midadulthood and contin-
ued to have impacts in late adulthood. In adolescence, however,
social integration was more pertinent to physical health than
social support as perceived by individuals. This life course pat-
tern of variation in the relative importance of social integration
and support to physiological functioning was previously unknown
and can have new practical import for policy intervention.
Our study sheds light on the biological mechanisms through
which social relationships impact health across the human life
span. Our findings suggest the early emergence and continuity of
the physiological impacts of social relationships across the life
course. They also suggest physiological vulnerabilities to social
stress that may be specific to life course stages and relationship
stressors. Disrupting various social relation deficits and physio-
logical risk connections could directly arrest early progression
toward chronic diseases and delay disease onset or lessen the
disease burden in late life. The findings, therefore, provide a strong
scientific basis for effective prevention and intervention that will lead
to further improvement in life expectancy.
Materials and Methods
We used longitudinal data from four nationally representative studies to test
path C and collectively cover all stages of the life course depicted in de-
velopmental trajectory D (Fig. 1). Refer to Data Description for details on
data description.
The physical health biomarkers that we examine are continuous measures of
CRP, systolic and diastolic BP, WC, and BMI, which represent important biological
pathways underlying stress response that strongly predict future disease and

 mortality (12). We also used categorical measures based on clinical cut points
that indicate the corresponding disease outcomes including inflammation, hy-
pertension, abdominal obesity, and obesity. Weighted descriptive statistics for
each biomarker sample and dataset were reported in Table S1. For social re-
lationship variables, we measured (i) social integration to capture the structural
and quantitative components of relationships and (ii) social support and social
strain to assess the quality of social connections in terms of the functions these
connections served. Details on scale construction and descriptive statistics for
relationship variables are included in Table S2.
We conducted multivariate regression analyses to examine the prospective as-
sociations between social relationship characteristics and biomarkers using the
longitudinal design unique to each dataset. For three studies where biomarkers
were assessed at the follow-up surveys only (Add Health, MIDUS, and HRS), we
estimated models of biomarker outcomes in relation to social relationship measures
assessed at prior points in time. Because the HRS included five waves of data on
social integration (1998–2006), we estimated the latent growth curve models to
most effectively summarize individual trajectories (19) (see Fig. S1 for HRS model
specification). The NSHAP provided repeated measures of three other biomarkers
at both baseline and the follow-up, including BP, WC, and BMI. Therefore, we used
longitudinal residual change models to examine the effects of social relationships
at wave I on changes in these biomarkers over time from wave I to wave II. This
design offers a more rigorous test of potential causality, as it minimizes the risks of
both reverse causality and spuriousness (e.g., that some other variable is affecting
both biomarkers and social relationships). For each outcome variable, we estimated
models in a stepwise fashion: (i) basic models of individual social relationship
variables adjusting for age, sex, and race; (ii) models of all social relation-
ship variables (when available for the samples) adjusting for age, sex, and
race; and (iii) full models adjusting for all covariates that are strong risk fac-
tors for inflammation, metabolic, and cardiovascular dysregulation and may
contribute to their associations with social relationships. See Data, Measures,
and Methods for a detailed description of analytic approaches for each
sample and Table S3 for covariates included in fully adjusted models.
