Do parents’ support behaviours predict
whether or not their children get sufficient
sleep? A cross-sectional study
Evelyn Pyper1*, Daniel Harrington1,2 and Heather Manson1,3
Abstract
Background: Sleep is an essential component of healthy cognitive and physical development. Lack of sleep
may put children at risk for a variety of mental and physical health outcomes, including overweight, obesity and
related chronic diseases. Given that children’s sleep duration has decreased in recent decades, there is a need to
understand the determinants of child sleep, including the role of parental support behaviours. This study aims to
determine the relative contribution of different types of parental support behaviours for predicting the likelihood
that children meet recently established Canadian sleep guidelines.
Methods: Data were collected using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) of parents or guardians with
at least one child under the age of 18 living in Ontario, Canada. To align with sleep guidelines, parents included in
this analysis had at least one child between 5 and 17 years of age (n = 1622). Two multivariable logistic regression
models were built to predict whether or not parents reported their child was meeting sleep guidelines – one for
weekday sleep and another for sleep on weekends. Independent variables included parent and child age and
gender, motivational and regulatory parental support behaviours, and socio-demographic characteristics.
Results: On weekdays, enforcing rules about child bedtime was a significant positive predictor of children meeting
sleep guidelines (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.03–2.44); while encouraging the child to go to bed at a specific time was a
significant negative predictor of child meeting sleep guidelines (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13–0.65). On weekends, none
of the parental support behaviours contributed significantly to the predictions of child sleep. For both weekdays
and weekends, the child’s age group was an important predictor of children meeting sleep guidelines.
Conclusions: The contribution of parental support behaviours to predictions of children meeting sleep guidelines
varied with the type of support provided, and weekend versus weekday sleep. While only enforcing bedtime rules
on weekdays contributed to children meeting sleep guidelines, the importance of children getting a good night’s
sleep, and the capacity of parents to help them do so, should be emphasized in public health efforts promoting
healthy child development.

 Background
Lack of sleep has become increasingly recognized as a
contributor to the obesity epidemic in children and
adolescents [1]. Elevated rates of childhood obesity and
overweight in western countries within the last decade
[2–4] have garnered substantial attention from public
health, with a particular emphasis on promoting healthy
active living, and limiting sedentary behaviour. While
both sedentary behaviour and sleep involve low energy
expenditure, they have opposite effects on children’s
weight [5]. Sleep is an essential component of healthy
cognitive and physical development, and lack thereof
can negatively impact children’s physical activity levels
as well as hormones associated with increased risks of
obesity, diabetes and hypertension [1, 6–8]. Even after
controlling for other known risk factors, inadequate
sleep significantly increases the risk of pediatric obesity
[9, 10]. Shorter sleep duration has also been shown to be
associated with poorer emotional regulation, academic
achievement, and lower quality of life/well-being [11].
Child sleep and family functioning (e.g., marital con-
flict; parenting stress) are inextricably linked [12–14],
and thus, it is imperative to view sleep from a family
context [15–17]. Indeed, behavioural interventions in
toddlers and preschoolers have proven effective for im-
proving both child sleep and family functioning [18, 19].
It follows that parents’ behaviours play a key role in
influencing children’s sleep patterns. Although the types
of behaviours that support adequate sleep may be more
limited than those for other health behaviours, type of
support has been shown to be important for achieving
child sleep outcomes. For example, periodically checking
on the child has been associated with longer sleep
duration in 11-year-olds [20]; conversely, active physical
comforting of one- and two-year-old children has been
associated with children’s sleep problems (e.g., resisting
bedtime, waking at night) [15]. This highlights the need
to clearly discern which parental support behaviours for
which age groups are optimal for child sleep.
Previous research has found that parents can actively
encourage their child’s development of self-regulation
[21], and this encouragement of autonomy and inde-
pendence has been linked to fewer sleep problems and
more consolidated child sleep [22, 23]. Parents can also
support their child’s sleep through enforcing rules, such
as setting bedtimes and structuring the child’s evening
time [14]. Although sleep needs and challenges differ
greatly across children’s ages, establishment of a bedtime
routine and development of a structured environment
(e.g., regular family mealtimes) may improve sleep for
both young children and adolescents [14, 24, 25].
Moreover, sleep quality and duration may be negatively
impacted by media use, with a particular threat being
screen
time in the bedroom
[7, 26, 27]. Parents’
restriction or discouragement of nighttime media use
has the potential to foster healthy child sleep behaviours
[26, 28], although determining the best means of doing
so remains elusive.
Children’s sleep duration has decreased by about 30 to
60 min in recent decades [29, 30], and in the Canadian
context, recent estimates reveal that 31% of school-aged
kids and 26% of adolescents are sleep-deprived [31]. In
acknowledgement of the emerging “sleepidemic,” the
2016 ParticipACTION Report Card on Physical Activity
for Children and Youth brought sleep to the forefront of
discussion of inactivity in Canadian children [32]. This
most recent report also promotes the new Canadian
24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth
[33],
which
outlines
what
a
healthy
24-h
period
should look like for 5- to 17-year-olds. The guidelines
introduce a new movement paradigm—of which sleep
is an integral component—emphasizing a whole day
approach. It presents sleep, not only as an important be-
haviour in its own right, but also as highly integrated with
the other movement behaviours of physical activity and
sedentary behaviour. While there is mounting evidence of
the importance of sleep as a protective factor for child-
hood overweight and obesity, there remains uncertainty
surrounding the optimal role of parental support for child
sleep [15].
Objectives
The objective of this study is to determine the relative
contribution
of different types of parental support
behaviours for predicting the likelihood that children
meet sleep guidelines on weekdays and weekends.
Methods
Data
This study uses data collected from a Computer Assisted
Telephone Interview (CATI) of Ontario parents/guardians
with at least one child under the age of 18 (n = 3206).
Details of the survey methodology can be found elsewhere
[34]. Briefly, the CATI data were collected by Public
Health Ontario between February and March, 2015. The
survey was developed for the evaluation of a community-
based program targeting childhood overweight and obes-
ity. To randomize at the household level, parents were
asked to respond on behalf of the child in the household
with the next birthday. This study is a secondary analysis
of a subsample baseline data, and it specifically focuses on
parents who answered questions in the survey about sleep.
Moreover, parents included in the subsample had at least
one child between 5 and 17 years of age, in order to make
comparisons with established sleep guidelines (n = 1622).
The dependent variables in this study were derived
from survey questions asking parents: (i) what time their
child usually wakes up during the week; (ii) what time
Pyper et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:432 
Page 2 of 10
 their child usually gets to bed during the week; (iii) what
time their child usually wakes up on the weekend; and
(iv) what time their child usually gets to bed on the
weekend. Bedtimes and wake-up times were used to
calculate total minutes of sleep duration for weekdays
and weekends. Sleep duration was compared to the
Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children
and Youth [33] (Table 1), accounting for child age, in
order to construct binary dependent variables (i.e., meets
guideline versus does not meet guideline) for weekdays
and weekends. Children who were below and above the
sleep duration recommendations were classified as not
meeting the guideline.
The four parental support behaviours for child sleep
represent
key
independent
variables
of
this
study.
Parents were asked to indicate whether they strongly
agree, agree, neither agree or disagree, disagree, or
strongly disagree with each of the statements found in
Table 2. The selection of bedtime- and screen-related
support behaviours reflects evidence that: family rules
are related to earlier bedtimes and greater total hours of
sleep [14]; screen time of children (and parents’ control
over that screen time) also influence child sleep duration
[26–28]. Dividing the support behaviours into “encour-
agement” and “rule enforcement” reflects the need to
clearly discern which specific types of parental support
predict children meeting sleep guidelines, as there is a
paucity of research making this distinction.
Accordingly, the second level of categorization as
Motivational or Regulatory (Table 2), is based on an
adapted framework [34] for classifying parental support
behaviours proposed by Beets et al. [35] that aimed to
answer analogous questions about parental support in
the context of physical activity, healthy eating, and
screen time. To create binary independent variables, the
responses strongly agree and agree were collapsed into a
single item, as were the remaining responses.
While derivations of the other independent variables
are described elsewhere [34], they are also provided here.
For the logistic regression models, child age was re-
coded from a continuous variable to a categorical
variable with the following age groups: 5 to 9 years old,
10 to 13 years old, and 14 to 17 years old. A binary vari-
able was created for parental marital status, comprised
of living with partner (living common-law, married) and
not living with partner (widowed, separated, divorced,
single). Time since immigration was re-coded to become
0 to 9 years (0–4 years ago, 5–9 years ago), 10+ years
(10–20
years
ago,
more
than
20
years
ago),
and
Canadian-born. A variable measuring parents’ highest
level of education completed was re-coded as follows:
below secondary school (never attended school, less than
secondary school graduation), secondary school diploma,
and post-secondary school (apprenticeship or trades
certificate or diploma; college, CEGEP or other non-
university certificate or diploma; university certificate or
diploma below bachelor level; bachelor’s degree; university
certificate, diploma or degree above bachelor level).
Employment status was also re-coded into the following
categories: employed (full-time, part-time, self-employed),
unemployed,
and
other
(Ontario
Disability
Support
Program, retired, student, homemaker, working without
pay, other). Total household income categories were re-
coded from increments of $10,000 to increments of
$20,000. It should be noted that those who refused to
report their income were treated as their own category
(did not respond).
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted with SAS Version 9.3. De-
scriptive statistics were calculated to describe the sample
by demographic characteristics, parental support behav-
iours, and child sleep duration. Bivariate analyses were
used to preliminarily consider the relationships between
all independent variables and dependent variables (i.e.,
whether children meet the guidelines) to assess un-
adjusted associations, and inform how the multivariable
logistic regression models were to be built.. Specifically,
independent samples t-tests were conducted for con-
tinuous variables, and chi-square tests were conducted
for categorical variables. Independent variables included:
child age and gender, parent age and gender, marital
status, time since immigration, education, employment
status, and total household income. Variance inflation
factors indicated that collinearity was not a concern.
To determine the relative importance of parent sup-
port behaviours in predicting whether children meet the
Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children
and Youth for sleep [33], two multivariable logistic
regressions were used—one for weekdays and one for
weekends. Models were built starting with parent and
child age and gender; followed by the inclusion of
parental support behaviours; followed by demographic

 characteristics. Interaction terms for all combinations of
child age and parental support behaviours were tested.
While some significant interactions emerged, interpret-
ation of the estimates was not intuitive. As such,
interaction terms were ultimately excluded to present
more parsimonious models, and minimize the risk of
interpreting spurious results. Differences between esti-
mates were tested for statistical significance at p < 0.05.
Results
Sample
Children ranging from 5 to 17 years old (mean = 11.1,
sd = 3.8, median = 11) were proportionately comprised
of males (n = 830, 51.2%) and females (n = 792, 48.8%).
The majority of parents responding to the survey were
female (72.4%), and parents’ ages ranged from 24 to
73 years (mean = 44.4, sd = 7.3, median = 44). Demo-
graphic characteristics and other variables describing the
study sample can be found in Table 3. It should be noted
that counts for missing categories—including those who
responded “Don’t know” and those who refused to
respond—are not included in all tables.
Guidelines
The proportion of parents that reported their child was
meeting the sleep guidelines ranged from 68.3% to
92.6% for weekdays, and 49.3% to 86.0% for weekends.
As shown in Fig. 1, the average proportion of children of
each age meeting sleep guidelines appeared to increase
between 5 and 9 years of age, and decline thereafter. In
addition to the decline in meeting sleep guidelines seen
between 9 and 17 years of age, this age range also
appears to be where discrepancy exists between week-
days and weekends. The greatest difference is seen for
15 year-olds, where the average proportion of children
meeting sleep guidelines on weekends is 38.3% less than
on weekdays.
Parental support Behaviours
The proportion of parents engaging in support behav-
iours for sleep were as follows: 93.9% encourage their
child to go to bed at a specific time; 89.6% encourage
their child to limit the time spent looking at screens in
their bedroom; 84.4% enforce rules about their child’s
bedtime; and 77.4% enforce rules about having screen’s
their child’s bedroom.
As Fig. 2 depicts, the proportion of parents engaging
in support behaviours for child sleep decreased between
the ages of 12 and 17, approximately. The largest decline
in these adolescent years was seen for the regulatory
support behaviours (enforcing rules).
Weekday model
As shown in Table 4, the following parental support
behaviours contributed significantly to the predictions of
child sleep on weekdays: parents who reported encour-
aging their child to go to bed at a specific time were

 71% less likely to have their child meeting sleep guide-
lines (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13–0.65); while parents who
reported enforcing rules about their child’s bedtime were
1.59 times more likely to have their child meeting sleep
guidelines
(95%
CI:
1.03–2.44).
These
associations
remained significant in the model after adjusting for
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. More-
over, compared to 10- to 13-year-old children, 5- to 9-
year-old children were 45% less likely to meet sleep
guidelines on weekdays (95% CI: 0.37–0.80), while 14- to
17-year-olds were 33% less likely (95% CI: 0.44–1.00).
Looking at the association of predicted probabilities and
observed responses, the c-statistic, or area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.63,
indicating a reasonably good model fit.
Weekend model
As shown in Table 5, none of the parental support
behaviours contributed significantly to the predictions of
child sleep on weekends. 14- to 17-year olds were 74%
less likely to meet sleep guidelines on weekends than
those aged 10- to 13-year-old (95% CI: 0.19–0.37). Male
children were 1.28 times more likely to meet sleep
guidelines on weekends than female children (95% CI:
1.01–1.62). Moreover, for parent age, every additional year
increased the likelihood of a child meeting sleep guidelines
on weekends by 3% (95% CI: 1.01–1.05). Looking at the
association
of
predicted
probabilities
and
observed
responses, the c-statistic, or area under the ROC curve is
0.68, indicating a reasonably good model fit.
Discussion
A major finding of the current study is that only paren-
tal support in the form of weekday bedtime rule enforce-
ment contributed significantly to children meeting sleep
guidelines; however, findings surrounding child age and
weekday/weekend
differences
also
warrant
further
discussion. Our results suggest that the proportion of
children meeting Canadian sleep guidelines decreases as
they enter and progress through adolescence. This dis-
covery is consistent with contemporary sleep duration
estimates by Chaput and Janssen [31], which reveal
shorter
sleep
durations
in
Canadian
children
and
adolescents as they grow older. The sleep duration trend
may be an indication of later bed times, rather than
earlier wake up times. For instance, almost half of 16- to

 17-year-olds reported going to bed after midnight on
weekends [31]). A number of factors contributing to in-
sufficient sleep in adolescents have been identified, in-
cluding: (1) biological processes (i.e., an evening-type
circadian phase; delayed melatonin production), (2)
social obligations (i.e., early school start times), (3)
consumption of caffeine (i.e., soda, coffee, and energy
drinks), and (4) media use (i.e., direct displacement of
sleep; disruption of circadian rhythms by light; or in-
creased sleep-disrupting arousal) [36].
The
present
study
compared
the
proportion
of
children meeting sleep guidelines on weekdays and
weekends, and found the greatest difference in 15-year-
olds. Interestingly, results from a 2014 multicohort study
of over 270,000 American adolescents observed that
over the previous 20 years, the largest decrease in the
proportion getting ≥7 h of sleep was also in 15-year-olds
[29]. As a potential high-risk group, the biological and
social factors at play for this particular age may warrant
further elucidation.
The larger discrepancies between weekday and week-
end sleep habits seen from middle childhood through
adolescence echo the work of others [7]. It is well estab-
lished that adolescents accumulate sleep debt from
regularly going to bed later during the week, which may
lead to later wake times on weekends (also known as
catch-up sleep) [29–31, 36, 37]. Yet, what appears incon-
sistent is whether this sleep debt leads to longer [11] or
shorter (as found in the present study) weekend sleep
duration in adolescents.
The
proportion
of
parents
engaging
in
support
behaviours for sleep was lower for the two regulatory
support behaviours, relative to the two motivational sup-
port behaviours. Similarly, the largest decline in parental
support for adolescents of increasing age was seen for
the two regulatory support behaviours. As children get
older, parents are usually less involved with their sleep
routines [17]. Nevertheless, parental rules—including an
earlier bedtime—have been shown to increase adolescent
total sleep [14], highlighting the need for increased
regulatory parental support.
In the weekday model, two parental support behav-
iours contributed significantly to predictions of children
meeting sleep guidelines. First, parents who reported en-
couraging their child to go to bed at a specific time were
less likely to have children meeting sleep guidelines on
weekdays. Given that motivational support behaviours
are defined by “prompting others to engage in the be-
haviour of interest” [35], it was unexpected to find that
encouragement was a negative predictor of sufficient
sleep in children. Because of this study’s cross-sectional
design, we cannot discern the direction of the relation-
ship between parental support and child sleep. Accord-
ingly, one possible explanation for this finding is that
“encouraging one’s child to go to bed at a specific time”
is a parent’s reaction to their child’s already-established
poor sleep habits. In other words, encouragement may
lend itself to being a reactive behaviour, while other
behaviours—such as rule-setting—may be more pro-
active. Given the lack of research on parental support
for child and adolescent sleep, the proposed explana-
tions would require further investigation in order to be
substantiated.
Second, parents who reported enforcing rules about
their child’s bedtime were more likely to have their child
meeting sleep guidelines on weekdays. Family rules have
been shown to be associated with earlier bedtimes and
greater total hours of sleep on weekdays for older
children (12 to 19 years old) [14]. One reason for this as-
sociation proposed by Adam, Snell, & Pendry [14] is that
parents more strictly enforce rules regarding bedtimes
during the week; however, their results also suggest that
it is not merely stricter bedtime rules—but rather more
general parental expectations, structure, or monitor-
ing—that affect child sleep on weekdays. In a meta-
analysis of risk and protective factors associated with
adolescent sleep, parent-set bedtime had the greatest
positive correlation with sleep duration [38]. However,
there is evident dissonance between parental bedtime
rule-setting as an important determinant of adolescent
sleep, and as a parent support behaviour reported less
frequently as children enter adolescence. The present
study includes a range of child ages—not one particular
age—when looking at the effect of bedtime rule enforce-
ment on child sleep. Age-specific investigations are
warranted to determine if these findings hold true in dif-
ferent age groups. Future studies should also consider
which specific rules parents can set and how parents can
enforce these rules to best support child sleep.
In the weekend model, none of the parental support
behaviours contributed significantly to predictions of
children meeting sleep guidelines. While non-significant
results for all support behaviours was unexpected, this
finding parallels that of prior research showing family
variables as better predictors of weekday, as oppose to
weekend, sleep behaviours [14]. A potential explanation
for these results is that parents exercise less control over
children’s schedules on weekends, giving children more
discretionary time to choose what activities they engage
in [39]. Time spent watching television, using the
computer or video games, socializing, playing sports,
working, and participating in religious activities all pre-
dict fewer hours of sleep on weekends [14]. Our results
do not rule out parental support behaviours as import-
ant determinants of child sleep on weekends; instead,
they point to the need to explore the child’s social and
household environments to gain a full picture of the
many factors affecting weekend sleep behaviours.

 A noteworthy finding of the current study is that,
while the use (and even presence) of screens in the
bedroom can negatively affect children’s sleep [40, 41],
parental rule enforcement and encouragement to limit
screens in the bedroom did not predict children meeting
sleep guidelines on weekdays or weekends. One possible
explanation is that use of electronic media or “screen
time” is an unstructured leisure activity, with no clear
starting and ending point [27]. Use of screens in the
bedroom may represent a child behaviour over which
parents have limited control [26]. Another contributing
factor is that restricting media may make it all the more
enticing [42], and the child’s bedroom may be a location
where screen use is less supervised. Finally, it is import-
ant to acknowledge the role of not only a parent, but the
entire family, in the creation and perpetuation of a
child’s sleep-displacing screen use [26]. Our findings
draw attention to the notion that traditional parenting
behaviours (rule-setting, encouragement) may not be
sufficient when it comes to changing screen time
behaviours in the bedroom; the sleep and screen use be-
haviours and expectations of the entire family should
considered in future studies.
Limitations
The present study has several limitations that warrant
discussion. First, all information was obtained from
survey data, and therefore, measures of parental support
and child sleep were parent-reported. Both measures are
therefore subject to recall bias, as well as social desirabil-
ity bias stemming from the desire to appear as a
supportive parent. In particular, child sleep duration may
be overestimated if parents’ responses were based on
when their child was in bed, as opposed to when their
child was actually asleep. Despite the drawbacks of using
subjective versus objective measures, current sleep dur-
ation
recommendations
are
based
largely
on
self-
reported sleep data [43]. A second, related limitation is
the study’s use of sleep duration as measure of children’s
sleep health. While duration is an important component
of sleep hygiene, other aspects including sleep quality,
consistency, continuity, and timing play an important
part in one’s overall health and well-being [32]. The
Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children
and Youth specify “uninterrupted” sleep; however, be-
cause sleep continuity could not be measured, the use of
sleep duration data allowed for clear comparisons with
these sleep recommendations in order to construct the
primary outcome variable. It should still be noted that
because this study’s measure of child sleep is based on
parent report, we cannot know whether the hours of
sleep are fragmented or truly uninterrupted. Third,
parents were asked the extent to which they agreed with
statements starting with “I encourage…” and “I enforce
rules…” (Table 2) without being provided with defini-
tions of encouragement and rule enforcement. Thus,
parents’
perceptions
of
these
words
informed
the
measures of parental support for child sleep. Fourth,
while the logistic regression models of the present study
controlled for factors such as time since immigration,
education, employment status, and total household in-
come, other cultural factors were not included. Although
it was beyond the scope of this study to ascertain cul-
tural backgrounds and implications for sleep habits, it is
important to acknowledge that cross-cultural variation
exists for sleep timing and duration [44]. Fifth, variables
exploring the whole day of the child (e.g., physical activ-
ity and sedentary time) were not able to be included in
the analyses. Due to the length of the survey, parents
were asked to answer at least two of the four health be-
haviour modules (physical activity, healthy eating, recre-
ational screen time, and sleep). These were randomly
selected at the time of the interview. Participants were
also invited to complete additional, optional modules at
the end of the survey. Given that the sample of parents
responding to the sleep module was not the same sam-
ple that responded to the physical activity module, for
instance, analyses could only be performed on variables
within the same module, not across modules. Sixth, the
adapted framework for classifying parental support be-
haviours [34] was developed after the survey questions
were designed. Accordingly, only motivational and regu-
latory support behaviours were measured and analyzed
in the current study. Future studies should consider also
including instrumental and conditional support behav-
iours to better understand the relationship between
parental support and child sleep. Finally, the complex re-
lationship between parental support behaviours, child
sleep, and child age is important to consider in future
studies. This study does not attempt to form conclusions
about the role of child age; for example, we cannot
assert that the influence of parental support on child
sleep varies across ages. More research on this relation-
ship, with a main focus on child age, is warranted.
Conclusion
The current study revealed that the contribution of
parental support behaviours to predictions of children
meeting sleep guidelines varied with the type of support
provided, and weekend versus weekday sleep. On
weekdays, bedtime rule enforcement—not encourage-
ment—was conducive to children achieving sufficient
sleep. Conversely, on weekends, no parental support
behaviours predicted children meeting sleep guidelines,
highlighting the need for future research on factors influ-
encing child sleep and/or diminishing parental influence
on weekends. Given the increasing pervasiveness of
electronic media use by children and adolescents, the
Pyper et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:432 
Page 8 of 10
 presence of screens in the bedroom remains a barrier to
children achieving sufficient sleep [7, 26, 27]. If parental
rules and encouragement to limit bedroom screen use do
not support child sleep, efforts should focus on how the
effectiveness of these supports can be maximized, and
what other elements of the home and bedroom environ-
ment should be modified. Moreover, consistent parental
support throughout the week and for children of all ages
may be an important, yet overlooked, component of over-
all sleep hygiene. The key recommendation emerging
from the present study is for parents to enforce rules
about their child’s bedtime on weekdays in order to
support them in achieving sufficient sleep. Preventing
childhood overweight and obesity necessitates a balance
of multiple health behaviours, including physical activity,
sedentary
behaviour,
and
sleep.
The
importance
of
children getting a good night’s sleep, and the capacity of
parents to help them do so, should be emphasized in
public health efforts to promote healthy childhoods.
