 Considerations for the Correct Diagnosis
of COPD and Its Management With
Bronchodilators
Antonio Anzueto, MD; and Marc Miravitlles, MD
COPD is often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated in many patients. COPD is a distinct
disease from adult-onset asthma; however, some patients with COPD may present with several
forms of airway disease described as asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). Bronchodilators and inhaled
corticosteroids (ICS) both have a place in standard maintenance treatment of COPD and
asthma; however, recommendations for use differ widely. In patients with COPD, long-acting
bronchodilators are effective initial monotherapy treatment, whereas ICS monotherapy is
recommended as initial treatment in patients with asthma. Clinicians need to be confident in
their diagnosis to ensure that correct treatment is given because misguided treatment decisions
can result in significantly increased safety risks for patients. This review highlights the differ-
ences in diagnosis and treatment between COPD, asthma, and ACO and discusses the data
supporting guideline recommendations for use of bronchodilators in COPD treatment in contrast
to asthma or ACO.

KEY WORDS: asthma-COPD overlap; bronchodilators; COPD; diagnosis
Despite the availability of well-established
recommendations for diagnosis and
management,1,2 COPD is often
misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated in
many patients, with approximately 50% of
adults with COPD in the United States
misdiagnosed or undiagnosed.3 Despite a
common pathophysiology,4 COPD is a
distinct disease from adult-onset asthma and
clinicians need to be confident in their
diagnosis to ensure the correct treatment.
To further complicate the matter,
approximately 15% to 20% of patients with
COPD may present with features of asthma,
described as asthma-COPD overlap
(ACO).5,6
Long-acting b2-agonist (LABA)
bronchodilators and inhaled
corticosteroids (ICS) both have a place in
standard maintenance treatment of COPD
and asthma; however, recommendations
for use differ widely between diagnoses. In
patients with COPD, LABAs are effective
initial monotherapy treatments, whereas
ICS use is only recommended in
combination with LABA treatment in
patients with more advanced disease.1

 Contrastingly, ICS monotherapy is recommended as
initial treatment in patients with asthma, whereas
LABA monotherapy was associated with an increase in
asthma-related death, resulting in a “black box”
warning being required on LABA-containing drug
labels.7 It is recommended that LABAs always be
administered in combination with ICS when treating
persistent asthma of any severity.6
There is limited pharmacologic evidence for the optimal
treatment of ACO because these patients have
historically been excluded from clinical trials.5,8
However, it is recommended that patients with ACO not
be treated with a LABA without an ICS.6
Differential Diagnosis of COPD and Asthma
A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in patients
who have symptoms such as dyspnea, chronic cough or
sputum production, and/or a history of exposure to risk
factors such as tobacco smoke or occupational
exposures.1 Importantly, postbronchodilator spirometry
is required to confirm the presence of persistent airflow
limitation.1 In some patients with mild airflow
obstruction, spirometry values may be normalized with
smoking cessation or use of bronchodilators. In fact, up
to 27.2% of subjects in a Canadian study9 and 15.6% of
smokers in a Spanish study10 had a reversal of their
COPD diagnosis. Therefore, patients initially diagnosed
with COPD, even those admitted with an exacerbation,
should be reassessed at follow-up to avoid overdiagnosis
and overtreatment.11
The diagnosis of asthma is based on the identification of
a characteristic pattern of symptoms, such as wheezing,
dyspnea, chest tightness, and cough, that varies over
time and in intensity, accompanied by variable
expiratory airflow limitation.6 It has been reported that a
significant number of adults diagnosed with asthma and
receiving treatment for the same do not actually fulfill
the diagnostic criteria for asthma and they may
discontinue asthma therapy.12 Therefore, similar to the
assessment of COPD, periodic reassessment of patients
with asthma is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis and
overtreatment.
COPD and asthma may be difficult to distinguish in
clinical practice.13 In addition, some patients may
present with characteristics of both diseases, which is
described as ACO. The 2017 Global Initiative for
Asthma strategy document6 recommends the following
step-wise approach to diagnosis of ACO: recognition of
the presence of chronic airway disease, characterization
of symptoms as related to asthma and COPD, and
confirmation of persistent airflow limitation. The 2017
Spanish guidelines of COPD2,14 note that patients who
meet the criterion for COPD and concomitant asthma,
or a diagnosis of COPD with a very positive
bronchodilator response (> 400 mL and >
15% increase in FEV1) and/or significant blood
eosinophilia (> 300 cells/mm3), can also be diagnosed
as ACO.2,14 The main advantage of diagnosing ACO in
clinical practice is to identify patients with COPD and
an improved response to ICS.5,8 ACO has only recently
been recognized as a distinct disease, and algorithms
have been proposed to aid clinicians in achieving the
correct diagnosis.2,8,14
The diagnosis of COPD, asthma, and ACO initially
requires an evaluation of exposure to respiratory risk
factors, identification of the type and pattern of
respiratory symptoms, and spirometry with a
bronchodilator test. If required, specific tests, such as
blood analysis with eosinophil counts and IgE levels,
bronchoprovocation test, and sensitivity tests for
pneumoallergens, can be used. A summary of the
differential diagnosis and first-line therapies is depicted
in Figure 1.
Treatment Options for COPD
Bronchodilators form the mainstay of maintenance
treatment for COPD and are recommended as initial
therapy for all Global Initiative for Chronic
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) groups.1 Patients
classified as GOLD group A (low symptom burden
and low exacerbation risk) are recommended to begin
short- or long-acting bronchodilator treatment based
on its effect on breathlessness, whereas patients
classified as GOLD groups B or C (high symptom
burden and low exacerbation risk, or low symptom
burden and high exacerbation risk, respectively)
receive a long-acting bronchodilator as initial
therapy.1
The combination of LABA and long-acting muscarinic
antagonist (LAMA) bronchodilators is recommended
for patients classified as GOLD groups B or C with
persistent symptoms after bronchodilator monotherapy,
or as initial treatment for patients classified as GOLD
group D (high symptom burden and high exacerbation
risk).1 Notably, combination treatment with a LAMA/
LABA increases FEV1 and reduces symptoms and

 exacerbations compared with LAMA or LABA
monotherapy.15,16
Monotherapy with ICS is not recommended for the
treatment of any stage of COPD.1 This is because of an
increased risk of adverse effects, such as pneumonia,
with regular use.17 In patients with COPD, long-term
treatment with ICS may be considered only in
combination with LABAs for patients with a history of
exacerbations despite appropriate treatment with long-
acting bronchodilators.18
The costs associated with treatment are not usually
taken into account in clinical practice guidelines and/or
in global strategy documents such as GOLD1; therefore,
there is a need to align clinical guidelines and
recommendations with the economic reality of each
country. Moreover, there is a need to implement
treatment regimens that provide the best cost-benefit
ratio.
Efficacy of LAMA/LABA Combinations
for COPD
LAMA/LABA combinations are effective treatments in
patients with COPD. Combining bronchodilators of
different classes, with different mechanisms and
durations of action, can improve bronchodilation with a
decreased risk of adverse events compared with
increasing the dose of bronchodilator
monotherapy.15,16,19 LAMA/LABA combinations
directly relax airway smooth muscle through stimulation
of the b2-adrenoceptors with a LABA and indirectly
relax smooth muscle through inhibition of the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors
with a LAMA.19 Treatment with a LAMA/LABA also
has additive effects on airway function in patients with
moderate to severe COPD, resulting in a beneficial effect
on exacerbations, likely because of reduced airway
resistance, improved inspiratory capacity, and reduced
hyperinflation.20,21 In addition, LAMA/LABA

 combinations offer significant improvements in lung
function parameters compared with their component
monotherapies15,22 and compared with LABA/ICS.23-26
Treatment with a LAMA/LABA generally improves
symptoms such as breathlessness, quality of life, and
health status vs monotherapies.15,27-30 Some LAMA/
LABA combinations have also demonstrated
improvements in nighttime and early morning
symptoms vs monotherapies, which are known to be
impactful at the individual patient level (eg, decreased
sleep disturbances).23
Choice of LAMA/LABA should be individualized for
each patient’s preferences and degree of disease burden
because no recommendations currently prioritize any
specific LAMA/LABA therapy over another, and no
LAMA/LABA therapy is approved for specific
subgroups of patients with COPD.23,27,29 Choice of
device must also be carefully considered on an
individual basis because each device has advantages and
limitations that ultimately affect patient response to
treatment and use of health-care resources.31,32 A
summary of the efficacy of a fixed LABA/LAMA
combination compared with long-acting bronchodilator
monotherapy and LABA/ICS is described in Table 1.
Safety of LAMA/LABA Combinations for
COPD
The safety profile of LAMA/LABA combinations in
patients with COPD is well documented, with no safety
concerns vs monotherapies or LABA/ICS.15,28-30,33-35
A recent meta-analysis of LABA/LAMA combinations
indacaterol/glycopyrronium, umeclidinium/vilanterol,
aclidinium/formoterol, and tiotropium/olodaterol
demonstrated no difference in adverse events compared
with the respective LABA alone and fewer adverse
events compared with LABA/ICS.29
Efficacy of ICS in Asthma and ACO
Despite the recommendation for limited use in patients
with COPD, ICS therapy is an encouraged treatment
option for patients with asthma. ICS as initial
monotherapy or in combination with LABAs effectively
control the symptoms of asthma.36 ICS alone has been
shown to offer benefits such as improved lung function
and symptom control and decreased airway
hyperresponsiveness compared with placebo.6 ICS/
LABA in combination has demonstrated improvements
in symptoms, lung function, and asthma control
compared with monocomponents and placebo37 and is
recommended in adult patients with asthma with
inadequate symptom control on ICS monotherapy.6 It
has also been suggested that LABA/ICS may be modestly
more effective at improving lung function than an
increased dose of ICS monotherapy in patients with
asthma.37
The clinical and inflammatory characteristics of patients
with ACO support the use of anti-inflammatory
treatment (ie, an ICS/LABA combination) as initial
therapy because of the beneficial effect of ICS in
asthma.38 ACO has been associated with a higher degree
of bronchial eosinophilic inflammation than COPD
alone; therefore, ICS treatment offers a greater clinical
and spirometric response and justifies its use in these
patients.1 Treatment with ICS/LABA has also
demonstrated improvements in a composite end point
of hospitalization or death in patients with COPD and a
codiagnosis of asthma compared with patients with
COPD alone.39
Safety Issues With ICS in COPD
Although there is a minor clinical role for ICS in COPD
management, it is important to note that patients with
COPD are at risk of ICS-related side effects. Increased
risk of pneumonia is the most troublesome adverse
effect of ICS in patients with COPD given the size of the
relative increase in risk, the frequency, and the
associated increase in mortality.17 The long-term use of
ICS in COPD is associated with changes in the lung
microbiome, resulting in changes in the bacterial load
and species in the airways, particularly for the more
frequently occurring pathogenic bacteria such as

 Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and
Moraxella catarrhalis.40 In addition, patients with
COPD are likely to be older and typically have several
comorbidities that may make them more susceptible to
adverse effects of ICS treatment, such as skin thinning
and bruising.41 Other safety concerns include increased
risk of bone fractures, an increase in blood glucose, an
increase in glycosylated hemoglobin, and risk of insulin
dependence among patients with diabetes, concerns of
adrenal insufficiency, and an excess of cataracts.17,41
The frequent long-term and unjustified use of ICS in
patients with COPD makes safety issues of particular
concern. Intensive use of ICS, alone or in combination
with LABA, has been observed in patients without an
indication for ICS use (ie, COPD of mild severity),
resulting in an unwarranted risk of serious side effects
derived from long-term use.42 In a large study of 11,858
patients with COPD from a longitudinal primary care
database, approximately 25% of patients classified as
GOLD groups A, B, and C were prescribed LAMA/
LABA/ICS triple therapy within 1 year after diagnosis,
despite a lack of indication for use, and a small
proportion even received triple therapy prior to
diagnosis.43 This inappropriate use of ICS exposes
patients to serious side effects early in disease
progression and wastes health-care resources.41 A lack of
understanding of the real impact of the side effects of
ICS on the COPD population in the clinical setting is
evidenced by a recent panel of COPD experts who were
unable to achieve agreement regarding questions on the
side effects of long-term use of ICS, with answers
differing widely among the panel.42 Many patients with
COPD do not need ICS, and clinical trials and real-
world evidence show that patients can be safely
withdrawn from ICS therapy, suggesting that the most
appropriate role of ICS in COPD management has yet to
be determined.44,45
Phenotypes of Patients With COPD Who
Respond to ICS
Despite many patients with COPD receiving ICS earlier
than indicated,46 recommendations specify that ICS
should be used only in patients with more severe COPD
(GOLD group D) who develop additional exacerbations
after optimal LAMA/LABA therapy.1,2,18 Given that
some patients do not respond to ICS and that ICS
therapy is associated with an increased risk of side
effects, it is advantageous to identify patients who are
likely to respond favorably to ICS therapy.
Eosinophil counts have been proposed as the most
promising biomarker of ICS response because patients
with COPD with asthmatic features tend to have higher
eosinophil counts than those without.8 Patients with
COPD with the ACO feature of elevated peripheral
eosinophils have shown to be significantly more likely to
have a significant therapeutic response to ICS/LABA
than patients with COPD alone, in particular in terms of
a reduction in the risk of exacerbations.47 Meanwhile,
minimal efficacy of ICS/LABA in patients with low levels
of blood eosinophils, together with the risk of side
effects, advises against their indication in this context.8,47
There is currently little agreement on an appropriate
cutoff value for eosinophils indicating ICS response in
COPD, with recommendations between 2% and 5% of
total cell count, and a suggested absolute cell count
between 200 and 300 cells/mL, indicating that further
evidence is needed to identify an optimal cutoff level to
predict response.8
Eosinophil levels have also been suggested as a
biomarker to predict response to ICS withdrawal.45 A
post hoc analysis of patients with severe to very severe
COPD and a history of exacerbations proposed that
eosinophil counts of $ 4% or $ 300 cells/mL may
identify a deleterious effect of ICS withdrawal, an effect
not seen in most patients with eosinophil counts below
these thresholds.48 Patients with high eosinophil counts
($ 400 cells/mL) were also more likely to experience
increased exacerbation rates after ICS withdrawal if they
had experienced two or more exacerbations in the last
year,49 suggesting that both eosinophil levels and
exacerbation history may be a more effective marker of
response to ICS withdrawal than eosinophil levels
alone.45
Other biomarkers have been suggested to predict the
presence of ACO phenotype in patients with COPD as
an indicator of ICS response, including serum IgE levels,
fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and CT scan parameters.
However, challenges such as poor standardization of
measurements and lack of clinically defined relevant
thresholds have resulted in limited clinical application
thus far.8 There is a need for better predictive
biomarkers in patients with COPD to establish optimal
diagnosis and treatment options.
Summary
Overall, clinicians need to be confident in their ability
to accurately diagnose COPD and distinguish
symptoms from those of asthma and ACO. Accurate

 diagnosis is vital to ensure that patients receive the
most appropriate treatment. Evidence has shown that
LAMA/LABA combinations are an effective and safe
therapeutic option in patients with COPD and play an
important role in reducing the risk of exacerbations in
patients for whom they are indicated. Bronchodilators
are recommended as initial therapy for all GOLD
groups, with the GOLD 2017 strategy document1
recommending a LAMA/LABA combination for
patients classified as GOLD groups B or C with
persistent symptoms after bronchodilator
monotherapy, or as initial treatment for patients
classified as GOLD group D (high symptom burden
and high exacerbation risk). Clinicians should only
consider adding ICS in those patients who experience
persistent exacerbations despite optimal treatment with
LAMA/LABA.1,50 In addition to careful symptom
assessment, the use of eosinophil counts may play an
advantageous role in predicting those patients who are
most likely to benefit from the addition of ICS therapy
in COPD.
