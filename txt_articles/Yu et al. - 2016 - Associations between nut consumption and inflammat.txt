ABSTRACT
Background: Increased nut consumption has been associated with
reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, as well
as a healthy lipid profile. However, the associations between nut
consumption and inflammatory biomarkers are unclear.
Objective: We investigated habitual nut consumption in relation to
inflammatory biomarkers in 2 large cohorts of US men and women.
Design: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 5013 participants in
the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-
Up Study (HPFS) who were free of diabetes. Nut intake, defined
as intake of peanuts and other nuts, was estimated from food-
frequency questionnaires, and cumulative averages from 1986 and
1990 in the NHS and from 1990 and 1994 in the HPFS were used.
Plasma biomarkers were collected in 1989–1990 in the NHS and
1993–1995 in the HPFS. Multivariate linear regression was used to
assess the associations of nut consumption with fasting plasma
C-reactive protein (CRP, n = 4941), interleukin 6 (IL-6, n = 2859),
and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2, n = 2905).
Results: A greater intake of nuts was associated with lower
amounts of a subset of inflammatory biomarkers, after adjusting for
demographic, medical, dietary, and lifestyle variables. The relative
concentrations (ratios) and 95% CIs comparing subjects with nut
intake of $5 times/wk and those in the categories of never or almost
never were as follows: CRP: 0.80 (0.69, 0.90), P-trend = 0.0003; and
IL-6: 0.86 (0.77, 0.97), P-trend = 0.006. These associations remained
significant after further adjustment for body mass index. No signif-
icant association was observed with TNFR2. Substituting 3 servings
of nuts/wk for 3 servings of red meat, processed meat, eggs, or
refined grains/wk was associated with significantly lower CRP (all
P , 0.0001) and IL-6 (P ranges from 0.001 to 0.017).
Conclusion: Frequent nut consumption was associated with
a healthy profile of inflammatory biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION
Nuts are nutrient-dense, rich in unsaturated fatty acids, high-
quality plant protein, fiber, minerals, vitamins, and other bio-
active compounds such as phytosterols and phenolic antioxidants
(1, 2). Epidemiologic studies have consistently shown that intake
of nuts is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD)9 and type 2 diabetes (3), and short-term trials have
demonstrated beneficial effects on intermediate markers of
cardiovascular disease risk, particularly lipids with a dose-
related reduction in LDL cholesterol (4, 5). Moreover, a variety of
healthful components in nuts such as magnesium, fiber, a-linolenic
acid, L-arginine, antioxidants, and unsaturated fatty acids may
also confer protection against inflammation (6).
Inflammation is a key process in the development of athero-
sclerosis associated with future CVD events (7). Chronic in-
flammation is also closely related to the pathogenesis of type 2
diabetes (8). Although several trials have investigated the as-
sociations between nut consumption and inflammatory bio-
markers, results have been inconsistent and limited by small
sample size (n # 50), short duration, targeting subjects with
certain health conditions, and combined effects with other di-
etary factors (9, 10). Few prospective cohort studies have ex-
amined the associations between nut intake and inflammatory
biomarkers (11, 12). In a cross-sectional analysis of the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis study, frequent nut consumption

 was associated with lower concentrations of C-reactive protein
(CRP), IL-6, and fibrinogen (12). Among participants with high
cardiovascular disease risk in the Primary Prevention of Car-
diovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED)
trial, those with the highest consumption of nuts at baseline had
the lowest concentrations of CRP, IL-6, and intracellular adhe-
sion molecule-1 (11). In both of these studies, however, nut
intake was only measured at one point in time, and thus the
studies were less able to capture habitual intake. Therefore, in
the current study, we aimed to investigate the associations be-
tween usual nut intake and biomarkers of inflammation in 2
large prospective cohorts of US adults using repeated mea-
surements of nut intake including separate data on peanuts, other
nuts, and peanut butter. We also examined the associations be-
tween substituting nuts for sources of animal protein, refined
grains, potatoes, and potato chips with concentrations of in-
flammatory biomarkers.
METHODS
Study population
Our cross-sectional analysis was conducted in 2 ongoing
prospective cohort studies: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS),
which consists of 121,700 female registered nurses aged 30–55 y
at baseline in 1976, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up
Study (HPFS), which consists of 51,529 male health pro-
fessionals aged 40–75 y at baseline in 1986. For each cohort,
mailed questionnaires were administered biennially to collect
data on lifestyle factors and health, with a follow-up rate ex-
ceeding 90% for each 2-y cycle. Between 1989 and 1990,
32,826 women in the NHS provided a blood sample and be-
tween 1993 and 1995, 18,159 men from the HPFS provided
a blood sample. As previously reported, participants who pro-
vided a blood specimen were generally similar to those who did
not in terms of diet and lifestyle (13). For the current study, we
included participants who provided a blood sample and were
previously selected as controls for nested case-control analyses
of type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, stroke, colon cancer,
colon polyps, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer (NHS), and
prostate cancer (HPFS). Participants with self-reported prevalent
diabetes at blood draw were excluded, as were those who fasted
less than 8 h before blood collection. After these exclusions,
a total of 5013 individuals with valid nut intake data were in-
cluded in the current analysis (Supplemental Figure 1). Be-
cause different combinations of biomarkers were measured by
substudies, the sample sizes for each biomarker varied: CRP
(n = 4941), IL-6 (n = 2859), and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) (n =
2905). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the
Human Subjects Committee Review Board of the Harvard T.H.
Chan School of Public Health.
Dietary assessment
Dietary intake was measured by use of validated food-
frequency questionnaires (FFQs) administered every 4 y as de-
scribed in detail previously (14). For the current study, we used
the last 2 FFQs before blood collection for each cohort (1986 and
1990 for NHS and 1990 and 1994 for HPFS). Participants were
asked to report how often, on average, they consumed a standard
portion of foods and beverages, by use of 9 possible responses
ranging from “never or less than once per month” to “6 or more
times per day.” Nutrient intakes were calculated by multiplying
the frequency of consumption of each unit of food and beverage
by nutrient contents and summing across all items. Values were
obtained with the use of the USDA food composition database.
FFQ items on nut consumption included “peanuts,” “other nuts,”
and “peanut butter.” “Other nuts” was regarded as all types of
tree nuts. Total nut consumption was defined as the intake of
peanuts and other nuts and did not include peanut butter. One
serving of nuts was equivalent to 28 g (1 oz) of peanuts or other
nuts and was equivalent to 1 tablespoon peanut butter. A vali-
dation study of the FFQ indicated that nut intake correlated well
with intakes assessed by multiple dietary records (r = 0.75) (15).
Biochemical analysis
Blood sample collections for both cohorts were described in
detail previously (16, 17). Briefly, a phlebotomy kit and in-
structions were sent to participants willing to provide blood
specimens between 1989 and 1990 in NHS and between 1993 and
1995 in HPFS. Samples were returned by overnight mail with
a frozen water bottle and processed immediately on arrival.
Whole blood samples were separated into plasma, buffy coat, and
erythrocytes and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen
freezers at 21508C until analysis. Quality control samples were
routinely frozen with study samples to monitor potential
changes caused by long-term storage and to assess assay sta-
bility. All biomarkers were measured in the Clinical Chemistry
Laboratory at the Children’s Hospital in Boston. Plasma
CRP was measured with the use of a highly sensitive im-
munoturbidimetric assay with reagents and calibrators from
Denka Seiken. IL-6 and TNFR2 were measured with the use of
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (R&D Systems). The
mean intra-assay CVs were ,10% for all assays. Our outcomes
included CRP because it is the best characterized and most used
biomarker of inflammation, and an elevated CRP concentration
has been shown to predict the development of both cardiovas-
cular events and type 2 diabetes (18); our outcomes also in-
cluded IL-6 and TNFR2 because they are key cytokines that
mediate both acute and chronic inflammation and have both
been shown to be associated with cardiometabolic risk (19, 20).
Covariates
In biennial follow-up questionnaires, we updated information
on lifestyle factors and medical history, including age, body
weight, smoking status, physical activity, medication use, and
history of chronic diseases. For nondietary covariates in this
analysis, we used questionnaires administered closest in time to
blood draw (1990 for NHS and 1994 for HPFS). BMI (in kg/m2)
was calculated using height measured in 1976 for the NHS and
1986 for the HPFS and weight measured closest to blood draw
(1990 for NHS and 1994 for HPFS). Information on dietary
factors was obtained from the last 2 FFQs before blood col-
lection for each cohort (1986 and 1990 for NHS and 1990 and
1994 for HPFS), and cumulative averages were used. The in-
flammatory diet score was calculated as previously described
(21), with a higher score indicating a more inflammatory diet.

 This pattern represents a diet relatively high in intakes of fish
(other than dark meat fish), tomatoes, processed meat, sugar-
sweetened beverages, other vegetables (i.e., vegetables other
than green leafy vegetables and dark yellow vegetables), red
meat, artificially sweetened beverages, refined grains, and organ
meats but low in pizza, wine, green leafy vegetables, dark yel-
low vegetables (comprising carrots, yellow squash, and yams),
beer, coffee, fruit juice, snacks, and tea. The reason for the
apparently contradictory observation that tomatoes increase the
score but pizza decreases it is because tomato paste, often used
as pizza sauce, contains a 2.5–4-fold higher concentration of
lycopene (a nutrient with anti-inflammatory properties) com-
pared with fresh tomatoes (22), and previous studies have gen-
erally found no associations between fresh tomatoes and
concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (23). Nut intake was
not included in the calculation of the inflammatory diet score.
Statistical analysis
Distributions of continuous biomarkers were assessed for
normality, and if skewed they were natural log-transformed in
analyses. To better reflect recent nut consumption, we calculated
the cumulative average of intakes from the last 2 FFQs before
blood collection for each cohort (1986 and 1990 FFQs of NHS
and 1990 and 1994 FFQs of HPFS). The distribution of nut intake
in each cycle was examined, and nut consumption remained
constant in both cohorts. To minimize the impact of potential
outliers and to facilitate pooling of results from the 2 cohorts, we
used the same categories for nut intake based on the FFQs: never
or almost never, ,1 time/wk, 1 time/wk, 2–4 times/wk, and $5
times/wk.
Generalized linear models were used to evaluate associations
between total nut intake and plasma biomarker concentrations. To
account for variation in sample handing and laboratory drift
among batches, all biomarkers were recalibrated by use of the
method of Rosner et al. (24). We tested for interactions by sex and
found no evidence that the associations of interest were different
in men and women (P-interaction . 0.05 for all 3 markers), so
we combined primary data from the 2 cohorts. Model 1 was
adjusted for demographic information including sex and age at
blood draw (continuous). Model 2 was additionally adjusted for
medical history and lifestyle variables including history of hy-
pertension (yes or no), history of hypercholesterolemia (yes or
no), smoking status (current, former, or never), physical activity
(continuous), alcohol intake (NHS: 0, 0.1–4.9, 5.0–14.9, or $15
g/d; HPFS: 0, 0.1–4.9, 5.0–29.9, or $30 g/d), total energy intake
(continuous), inflammatory diet score (continuous), and meno-
pausal status and postmenopausal hormone use (premenopausal,
postmenopausal without hormone use, or postmenopausal with
hormone use) in NHS. Model 3 was further adjusted for BMI,
a potential mediator of the association between nut intake and
inflammation. For continuous covariates, we assigned corre-
sponding medians to the missing values. For categorical
covariates, subjects with missing data were assigned to corre-
sponding reference groups. Least-squares means of biomarkers
were estimated in frequency categories of nut intake, and linear
trends were tested. For better illustration, we presented the re-
sults using relative concentrations (ratios) with 95% CIs of the
biomarker amounts among subjects with greater nut consump-
tion to those with the lowest intake category (i.e., never or
almost never as reference). Potential interactions with BMI and
medical history were tested by adding an interaction term of nut
intake (continuous) with BMI (,25 compared with $25), his-
tory of hypertension (yes or no), history of hypercholesterolemia
(yes or no), or inflammatory diet score (quartiles). We also
performed the analysis by type of nut (peanuts or other nuts), as
well as peanut butter because it is a popular source of nuts in the
diet.
The effect of substituting 3 servings of nuts/wk for 3 servings
of animal protein food sources or poor quality carbohydrate
foods/wk was estimated by including both terms as continuous
variables in the same multiple regression model (25, 26). The
differences in their b coefficients, variances, and covariance
were used to estimate b coefficients 6 SEs and P values of the
substitution effect. Both animal protein foods and poor quality
carbohydrates have been previously associated with cardiovas-
cular disease and/or diabetes in our cohorts. Individual sub-
stitution foods included (1 oz = 28 g, 1 cup = 227 g): red meat
(serving size: 4–6 oz), processed meat (serving size: piece or
slice), poultry (serving size: 4–6 oz), seafood (serving size: 3–5 oz),
eggs (serving size: 1), potatoes (including boiled or mashed
potatoes and French fries) (serving size: 1 cup), potato chips
(serving size: small bag or 1 oz), and refined grains (serving
size: 1 cup cooked).
In a sensitivity analysis, we examined the associations between
most recent nut consumption (1990 for NHS and 1994 for HPFS)
and amounts of inflammatory biomarkers to test the robustness of
our main results. For all statistical analyses, 2-sided P , 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant. All data analyses
were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 for
UNIX (SAS 170 Institute).
RESULTS
The age-adjusted characteristics of study participants
according to their frequency of nut intake are shown in Table 1.
Participants from both cohorts who had a higher intake of nuts
tended to be older, were more likely to exercise, drank more
alcohol, and had lower CRP and IL-6 concentrations than with
those with a lower intake. In addition, women in the NHS who
had a higher intake of nuts also had lower BMI and were more
likely to use postmenopausal hormones than with those with a
lower intake.
Associations between nut intake and inflammatory
biomarkers
Relative concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers by fre-
quency of nut consumption are shown in Table 2. Greater total
nut consumption was associated with lower plasma CRP and
IL-6 concentrations in age- and sex-adjusted models (model 1);
relative concentrations (95% CIs) comparing subjects with nut
intake of $5 times/wk and those in the categories of never or
almost never were CRP: 0.81 (0.71, 0.93), P-trend = 0.001; and
IL-6: 0.87 (0.78, 0.97), P-trend = 0.005. Similar results were
found in multivariate models adjusting for demographic, medi-
cal history, and lifestyle variables (model 2); relative concen-
trations (95% CIs) comparing subjects with nut intake of $5
times/wk and those in the never or almost never categories were
CRP: 0.80 (0.69, 0.90), P-trend = 0.0003; and IL-6: 0.86 (0.77,

 0.97), P-trend = 0.006. These associations were attenuated but
remained statistically significant after further adjustment for
BMI (model 3); relative concentrations (95% CIs) comparing
subjects with nut intake of $5 times/wk and those in the cate-
gories of never or almost never were CRP: 0.84 (0.74, 0.95),
P-trend = 0.006; and IL-6: 0.88 (0.79, 0.99), P-trend = 0.016.

beverages, other vegetables (i.e., vegetables other than green leafy vegetables and dark yellow vegetables), red meat, artificially sweetened beverages, refined
grains, and organ meats but low in pizza, wine, green leafy vegetables, dark yellow vegetables (comprising carrots, yellow squash, and yams), beer, coffee,

 We did not observe statistically significant association between
nut consumption and TNFR2 amount. In a sensitivity analysis,
similar results were observed with the use of most recent nut
consumption instead of cumulative averages (Supplemental
Table 1). The associations between nut intake and inflammatory
biomarkers did not differ by sex. Relative concentrations (95%
CIs) comparing subjects with nut intake of $5 times/wk and
those in the never or almost never categories were CRP: NHS
0.87 (0.73, 1.01), HPFS 0.73 (0.61, 0.86), P for heterogeneity =
0.16; IL-6: NHS 0.89 (0.75, 1.03), HPFS 0.88 (0.75, 1.01), P for
heterogeneity = 0.91; and TNFR2: NHS 0.99 (0.92, 1.05), HPFS
0.99 (0.94, 1.04), P for heterogeneity = 0.94. The associations
were also not different across groups defined by BMI, hyper-
tension, hypercholesterolemia status, or inflammatory diet score
(all P-interaction $ 0.23) (data not shown). Similarly, intakes of
peanuts and other nuts were both inversely associated with in-
flammatory markers. Higher intake of other nuts was signifi-
cantly associated with lower CRP and IL-6, and higher intake
of peanuts was associated with lower CRP and TNFR2 (Sup-
plemental Table 2). However, the tests for heterogeneity be-
tween peanuts and other nuts were not statistically significant
(P-heterogeneity $ 0.48 for all 3 biomarkers). No associations
were observed for peanut butter.
Substitution analyses of nuts for other food sources
Substituting 3 servings of nuts/wk for 3 servings of red meat,
processed meat, eggs, or refined grains/wk was associated with
significantly lower CRP (all P , 0.0001) and IL-6 (P ranges
from 0.001 to 0.017). Lower CRP concentrations were also
observed when substituting 3 servings of nuts/wk for potatoes
(P = 0.003) and potato chips (P = 0.001) (Table 3). Similar results
were found for peanuts and other nuts (Supplemental Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In these 2 large prospective cohorts, nut consumption was
inversely associated with concentrations of the inflammatory
biomarkers CRP and IL-6. Substituting nuts for red meat, pro-
cessed meat, eggs, refined grains, potatoes, or potato chips was
associated with a healthier inflammatory biomarker profile. To
our knowledge, this is the first study that has examined habitual
nut intake in relation to inflammatory markers with the use of
repeated measurements of diet and has examined the substitution
of nuts for animal sources of protein and low-quality carbohy-
drate foods on inflammation.
Our results are consistent with previous observational studies
that have found inverse associations between nuts and in-
flammatory markers. In a cross-sectional analysis of the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis study, nut and seed consumption
was inversely associated with CRP, IL-6, and fibrinogen; relative
concentrations comparing $5 times/wk with never or almost
never were CRP: 0.87; IL-6: 0.92; and fibrinogen: 0.97 (all
P-trend # 0.004) (12). Similar to our study, comparable asso-
ciations were observed for tree nuts and peanuts. We did not
observe associations with peanut butter, possibly because we
underestimated intake amounts. In our analysis, 1 tablespoon
peanut butter was considered a serving, but the standard serving
size is 2 tablespoons. The lack of association could also be
due to loss of healthful components or addition of ingredients
that may be unhealthy during processing. In a baseline cross-
sectional analysis of the PREDIMED trial, those with the
highest nut intake had the lowest concentrations of CRP, IL-6,
and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (11). However, because
participants were at high risk of developing CVD, results could
be skewed by already elevated concentrations of inflammatory
markers. In addition, in both of these studies, nut intake was
only measured once, which is less able to capture habitual
intake.
In contrast, findings from trials have been inconsistent (9, 10,
27–30). Potential reasons for this include: small sample size,
short duration, targeting unhealthy subgroups, use of single nut
types, and combined effects with other dietary factors. For ex-
ample, two 4-wk crossover trials of almonds (n = 27) and
walnuts (n = 21) conducted among individuals with hypercho-
lesterolemia did not find significant changes in CRP (30, 31).
The PREDIMED trial observed a reduction in IL-6 but not CRP
in participants consuming a Mediterranean diet with 30 g mixed
nuts, compared with the low-fat diet group (29). However, the
trial of Rajaram et al. (28) found that a diet enriched with 2
doses of almonds/d reduced CRP but not IL-6, relative to
a healthy nut-free diet.
Previous studies have shown that nut consumption is inversely
associated with BMI despite being an energy-dense food, and
BMI is a strong determinant of inflammatory biomarkers.
Moreover, weight loss has been repeatedly observed to be as-
sociated with a decrease in amounts of inflammatory biomarkers
(32–34). Thus the associations between nut intake and in-
flammatory markers could be mediated in part through BMI (35,
36). Similar to other observational studies (12), in our analysis,
associations between nut intake and amounts of CRP and IL-6

cluding both nuts and other food sources as continuous variables in the same
multiple regression models. The differences in their b coefficients, variances,
and covariance were used to estimate the substitution effect. Models were

(yes or no), history of hypercholesterolemia (yes or no), smoking status (cur-
rent, former, or never), physical activity (continuous), alcohol intake (NHS: 0,

 were attenuated after adjusting for BMI but remained statisti-
cally significant, suggesting that BMI accounts for a proportion
of the associations.
Nuts are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, and in several previous
trials and cohort studies PUFAs, particularly a-linolenic acid,
which is high in walnuts, were inversely associated with
CRP, IL-6, TNFR2, and other inflammatory markers (37–43).
Other constituents of nuts, such as dietary fiber, vitamin E,
L-arginine, and phenolic compounds, have also been suggested
to have anti-inflammatory effects (44–49). L-Arginine, an amino
acid with a high content in peanuts and hazelnuts, is a pre-
cursor for endothelium-derived nitric oxide synthesis, which
may also explain the beneficial effects of nut intake on vascular
reactivity (10).
Our findings suggest that the inverse associations between nut
consumption and risk of CVD and type 2 diabetes may be partly
due to association with vascular inflammation. Low-grade
systemic inflammation is a well-established common ante-
cedent for both CVD and type 2 diabetes (50), possibly through
inducing endothelial dysfunction. Inflammation plays a major
role in all phases of atherosclerosis that predicts future CVD
events. Both CRP and IL-6 have been identified as independent
predictors of CVD (7), and CRP and IL-6 concentrations are
associated with quantitative measures of insulin resistance (51).
In our cohorts, CRP and IL-6 were associated with increased
risk for CHD, whereas TNFR2 was related to increased risk
among women only, suggesting that this biomarker may not be
as predictive, which may partly explain our null findings with
TNFR2 (52).
Our study has several strengths. A large sample size and
detailed diet and lifestyle information provided us with sufficient
power to detect associations with nut intake and finely control for
potential confounding. By use of the cumulative mean nut intake
from multiple FFQs, we were able to reduce within-person
variability (53). Having detailed information on medical history
allowed us to reduce recall bias by excluding participants with
chronic diseases that may influence diet. Although our study was
conducted among predominantly white health professionals,
which increases internal validity, there is no reason to expect that
these biological relationships would be different in other pop-
ulations. Other limitations include the cross-sectional nature of
our analysis; although we adjusted for many potential con-
founders, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual con-
founding. In addition, some measurement error with the use of
FFQs to assess diet and a single measure of inflammatory markers
is likely, and such nondifferential misclassification may have
attenuated the results. However, the FFQ has been validated, and
the correlations for nuts are among the most accurately reported
(14, 15), and the long-term stability of plasma biomarkers from
our cohorts has been previously reported (54).
In conclusion, we found that greater nut intake was associated
with lower concentrations of CRP and IL-6, and these associa-
tions were independent of BMI. Substituting nuts for red and
processed meat, eggs, refined grains, potatoes, or potato chips
was associated with a healthier profile of inflammatory markers.
These data support an overall healthful role of nuts in the diet and
suggest an inverse association with inflammation as one of the
potential mechanisms underlying inverse associations between
nuts and cardiometabolic diseases, although confirmation in large
trials is warranted.
