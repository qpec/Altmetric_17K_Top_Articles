ABSTRACT
The global burden of bacterial disease remains high and is set against a backdrop of increasing 
antimicrobial resistance. There is a pressing need for highly effective and natural antibacterial 
agents. In this work, the anti-biofilm effect of cinnamon oil on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus was evaluated. Then, cinnamon oil was encapsulated in liposomes to enhance its chemical 
stability. The anti-biofilm activities of the liposome-encapsulated cinnamon oil against MRSA 
biofilms on stainless steel, gauze, nylon membrane and non-woven fabrics were evaluated by colony 
forming unit determination. Scanning electron microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy 
analyses were employed to observe the morphological changes in MRSA biofilms treated with the 
encapsulated cinnamon oil. As a natural and safe spice, the cinnamon oil exhibited a satisfactory 
antibacterial performance on MRSA and its biofilms. The application of liposomes further improves 
the stability of antimicrobial agents and extends the action time.

Introduction
Bacterial infections, because of their potential to be life 
threatening, have been given increasing public attention. 
Often, bacteria survive by adhering onto surfaces where 
they form complex structures consisting of surface-
attached bacterial cells surrounded by extracellular 
compounds (Malheiros et al. 2010). Bacteria in biofilms 
exhibit enhanced resistance to antibiotics. This results 
in persistent and stubborn infections owing to their 
long term viability. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) is known to cause skin infections and 
respiratory disease. It leads to a mass of severe nosocomial 
infections, and, due to excessive antibiotic use, has become 
the multiple drug resistant pathogenic bacterium most 
threatening to human health. The drugs vancomycin, 
linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have all been 
approved for clinical treatment of MRSA infection by the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but alternatives to 
the existing antibiotics against MRSA biofilm infections 
are still of interest (Taubes 2008; Bridier et al. 2011).
Essential oils (EOs), odorous and volatile products of 
plant secondary metabolism, have been widely applied in 
folk medicine as antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial 
activity of EOs is ascribed to terpenes, which can destroy the 
microbial cytomembrane due to their lipophilic character. 
Cinnamon oil is widely used in food seasoning, clinical 
treatment, health care and other aspects. There have been 
numerous reports on the various functions of cinnamon 
oil, such as its antioxidant (Mathew & Abraham 2006), 
anti-cholesterol (Dugoua et al. 2012) and antimicrobial 
(Becerril et al. 2007) activities. In addition, cinnamon oil 
has been classified as a substance generally recognized 
as safe (GRAS) for food preservation by the FDA (FDA 
2014). Unfortunately, the present application of cinnamon 
oil is limited due to its volatility and chemical instability in 
the presence of air, light, moisture, and high temperatures. 
Many novel methods have been developed to enhance the 
stability and bioavailability of cinnamon oil. One of these 
methods is to use liposomal encapsulation to prevent loss 
of its active ingredients during processing and storage.
Liposomes, spherical lipid bilayer vesicles, are formed 
by hydrophilic groups and lipophilic groups with an 
aqueous core and a hydrophobic outside layer (Lu et al. 
2014). The main materials of conventional liposomes are 
natural and safe constituents such as lecithin from egg yolk 
or soy beans, and cholesterol. As colloid carriers, liposomes

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis
After being treated with cinnamon oil (MIC) at 37°C for 
3 h, the MRSA suspensions were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm 
for 10 min. The bacterial cells were fixed in 2.5% gluta-
raldehyde for 4 h at 4°C. The samples were then dehy-
drated in a sequential graded ethanol (30, 50, 80, 90, and 
100%) and the ethanol was replaced by 100% tertiary butyl 
alcohol. Finally, samples were sputter-coated with gold in 
an ion coater for 2 min, followed by observation with a 
scanning electron microscope (JSM-7001F, JEOL, Tokyo, 
Japan) (Bajpai et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2016).
Determination of minimum biofilm inhibitory 
concentration (MBIC) and minimum biofilm 
eradication concentration (MBEC)
The anti-biofilm activity of cinnamon oil was measured 
by MBIC (Mohammadi 2006) and MBEC assays (Wu 
et al. 2013). The MBIC was defined as the lowest concen-
tration of cinnamon oil without visible growth of biofilm 
in 96-well platforms. The wells were filled with tryptone 
soya broth (TSB) containing MRSA (105−6 CFU ml−1) 
and cinnamon oil (0.125–4.0 mg ml−1). After incuba-
tion at 37°C for 48 h, the plate was washed and 0.05% 
3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetra-
zolium bromide (MTT) was added. After incubation at 
37°C for 4 h, the MTT was replaced by formazan dissolv-
ing solution and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. 
MBEC indicates the lowest concentration leading to clear 
wells. Cinnamon oil (0.5–8.0 mg ml−1) in PBS was added 
to the biofilm formed. No cinnamon oil was the control. 
The plate was incubated at 37°C for 24 h (Sabaeifard et al. 
2014), and then the absorbance was measured.
Anti-biofilm effects of cinnamon oil on MRSA
Biofilm viability was assessed with the MTT staining 
method. After forming the biofilm, cinnamon oil (0.5, 1.0, 
2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 mg ml−1) was inserted into each well. The 
plates were incubated statically at 37°C for 24 h and the 
amount of biofilm was determined as previously described 
(Jakub et al. 2009). The biofilm CFU counting method was 
utilized for further study (Pettit et al. 2005).
Preparation of liposomes
Soy lecithin and cholesterol (5:1) were dissolved in trichlo-
romethane, and mixed with cinnamon oil. The mixture 
was evaporated in a rotary evaporator until a thin film 
was formed and dried in a vacuum oven at 30°C for 24 h. 
Then the lipid film was suspended in PBS (pH=7.2) and 
homogenized in a cell ultrafine grinding instrument for 
have many advantages, including biocompatibility, 
bioavailability, solubilization of insoluble compounds and 
a sustained-release performance (Kima & Baianua 1991; 
Neethirajan & Jayas 2011). By liposome encapsulation, the 
volatility and chemical instability of EOs can be reduced, 
without changing their chemical ingredients. Liposomes 
can also improve the antimicrobial activity of EOs, mainly 
due to their subcellular size which can strengthen the 
passive absorption mechanism of cells and reduce the 
transport resistance of materials (Xiao et al. 2011).
In this work, inspired by previous research (Lin Lin 
et al. 2015), a new antibacterial agent was developed 
through combining the antimicrobial properties of cin-
namon oil with the advantages of liposomes. The lipos-
omes containing cinnamon oil were prepared by a thin 
film ultrasonic dispersion method, and the antibacterial 
properties of cinnamon oil and the liposome-encapsulated 
cinnamon oil against MRSA biofilms were assessed.
Materials and methods
Materials and culture
The cinnamon oil was obtained from J.E International 
(Caussols Plateau, France). The MRSA ATCC 43300 
strain was provided by National Center for Type Culture 
Collection (NTCC) and stored with liquid paraffin wax 
at 4°C. MRSA was cultured by shaking in nutrient broth 
(NB) medium at 37°C for 48 h.
Antibacterial activity of cinnamon oil
Determination of minimal inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)
The MIC and MBC were determined using the broth 
micro dilution method (Gachkar et al. 2007; Bajpai et al. 
2013). Cinnamon oil (0.125–4.0 mg ml−1) in NB was pre-
pared in tubes with MRSA (105−6 colony forming units 
(CFU) ml−1). MIC was defined as the lowest concentra-
tion of cinnamon oil without visible growth. MBC was 
regarded as the lowest concentration of cinnamon oil 
where no visible growth was observed on the agar plates.
Time-kill analysis
The antimicrobial activity of cinnamon oil was tested 
by the plate colony counting method (Pettit et al. 
2005). The tubes with cinnamon oil (0.20 mg ml−1) 
and MRSA (~105−6 CFU ml−1) were incubated at 
37°C with shaking. Then, the numbers of residual 
bacteria were observed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h. 
For comparison, the bacterial suspensions in sterile 
phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 7.4) without 
cinnamon oil were also tested.

30 min at 360 W. The mixture was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm 
for 15 min. Finally, the liposomes were filtered using a 
0.22 μm membrane (Lu et al. 2014).
Characterization of the liposomes
Particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and Zeta 
potential
The particle size and PDI were determined by a 
dynamic light scattering zetasizer (Nano ZS90, Malvern 
Instruments, Worcester, UK) (Song et al. 2014). The Zeta 
potential was measured in folded capillary cells at 25°C.
Encapsulation efficiency
Cinnamon oil (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg ml−1) was ana-
lyzed by GC-MS (Agilent 6890 N/5973 N, Agilent, Santa 
Clara, CA, USA). From this, a standard curve (Wen et al. 
2010) was obtained. Subsequently, liposomes were centri-
fuged at 20,000 rpm for 1 h. The vesicles were dissolved in 
ethanol, followed by treatment using an ultrasonic wave 
for 3 h. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm 
for 15 min. The supernatant was kept and analyzed by 
GC-MS.
Atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis
The liposomes were diluted with PBS and a drop put onto 
a mica sheet for 3 min. Then, an equal volume of tri-dis-
tilled water was added to the mica sheet. Finally, the sam-
ple was observed by AFM (Agilent 5500) after drying in 
air (Lin et al. 2015).
Anti-biofilm assay of liposome containing cinnamon 
oil
Effect of liposomes on MRSA biofilms on different 
carrier materials
The biofilm CFU counting method (Pettit et al. 2005) 
was used to assess the effect of liposome on established 
biofilms. After biofilm formation for 48 h on sterile stain-
less steel, gauze, nylon membrane and non-woven fabrics 
(2 cm × 2 cm), the TSB was gently aspirated and the tubes 
were rinsed. Liposomes (containing 1.0 mg ml−1 cinna-
mon oil) in PBS were inserted into each tube. The tubes 
without liposomes acted as controls. The tubes were incu-
bated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, the biofilm-containing tubes 
were sonicated moderately using a water table sonicator 
for 5 min for viable cell counting.
Long-term anti-biofilm activity of liposome 
containing cinnamon oil
The long-term anti-biofilm activities of cinnamon oil 
and liposome-encapsulated cinnamon oil on different 
carrier materials were tested by the method of Cui et al. 
(2016). After biofilm formation, liposomes (containing 
1.0 mg ml−1 cinnamon oil) and cinnamon oil (1.0 mg ml−1) 
were added to the samples. The tubes without liposomes 
acted as controls. Then the samples were incubated stati-
cally at 37°C. Quantitative analysis of biofilms was carried 
out every day by the plate colony-counting method.
SEM of MRSA biofilms
After biofilm formation for 48 h on nylon membrane, 
the biofilm was treated with 1.0 mg ml−1 of liposomes 
for 24 h. The pretreatment was carried out as described 
above. Finally, the morphology of the MRSA biofilms was 
observed by SEM. For comparison, the biofilms without 
cinnamon oil were also observed (Jean et al. 2004).
Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) analysis
The biofilms were detected using the 4′6-diamidi-
no-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining method, with mod-
ification according to Carvalho et al. (2012). The MRSA 
biofilm was treated with liposomes (1.0 mg ml−1) for 24 h. 
An equal volume of DAPI (10 μg ml−1, Roche Diagnostics 
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was dropped onto the bio-
films, and then they were kept in dark for 10 min. The 
sample was observed by LSCM (Leica TCS SP5 II, Leica, 
Wetzlar, Germany). The biofilm in sterile PBS without 
liposome was observed as a control.
Statistical analysis
The data were presented as mean value ± standard devi-
ation (SD). The statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
The anti-biofilm activity of cinnamon oil
The MIC, MBC and MBIC, MBEC values of the cinna-
mon oil against MRSA are shown in Table 1. The MIC 
and MBC values of cinnamon oil were 0.25 mg ml−1, and 
both the MBIC and MBEC values of cinnamon oil were 
1.0 mg ml−1. As such, cinnamon oil was an effective bacte-
rial inhibitor and bactericide against MRSA, and showed 
prominent anti-biofilm activity to MRSA. As shown in 
Figure 1, around 99.99% reductions in the MRSA popula-
tions were observed after cinnamon oil treatment for 4 h. 
After treatment for 16 h, almost 99.99999% reductions in 
the MRSA populations were achieved.
The SEM images of MRSA are shown in Figure 2. The 
morphological changes in MRSA observed in the SEM 
images will help to further investigate the efficacy of cin-
namon oil. As shown in Figure 2, the membranes of the 
untreated MRSA cells were smooth and complete. When

were dropped into tubes containing PBS with a different 
content of cinnamon oil. After 24 h, the population of 
MRSA decreased by 2.83 logs using 1.0 mg ml−1 cinnamon 
oil treatment (Figure 4).
Characterization of liposomes
The physico-chemical properties of liposomes with differ-
ent amounts of cinnamon oil are shown in Table 2. The par-
ticle size increased from 133.2 ± 1.53 to 157.2 ± 1.72 nm, 
with increasing cinnamon oil concentrations from 3.0 
to 6.0 mg ml−1. The PDI value was used to characterize 
the particle size distribution. The PDI value distribution 
of the liposomes in the present study is narrow, from 
0.229 ± 0.018 to 0.245 ± 0.007. The block level of sus-
pended solids in water to light was measured by turbidity. 
The turbidity increased from 399 ± 11.9 to 742 ± 16.4 NTU, 
in good agreement with the constantly increasing particle 
sizes. The pH values varied from 7.08 ± 0.01 to 7.14 ± 0.02. 
The Zeta potential values ranged from –57.0 ± 1.23 to 
the MRSA cells were treated with cinnamon oil, the mem-
branes showed irreversible destruction. As illustrated in 
Figure 2, the membranes of the MRSA cells treated with 
cinnamon oil were rough, wrinkled and irregular, indi-
cating that the cinnamon oil can damage the MRSA cell 
membranes to reach antibacterial effectiveness.
The effects of different concentrations of cinnamon oil 
on the viability of the MRSA biofilm were evaluated after 
treatment for 24 h. The optical density (OD) values of 
MRSA biofilms treated with 1.0 mg ml−1 cinnamon oil 
were reduced from 2.26 to 0.16 (Figure 3). However, the 
anti-biofilm effects showed no evident improvement when 
the concentration of cinnamon oil was > 1.0 mg ml−1. This 
indicates that 1.0 mg ml−1 of cinnamon oil was enough to 
eradicate the MRSA biofilm. Similar results were observed 
when MRSA biofilms incubated on stainless steel flakes

0.230 ± 0.012. From the data obtained, the liposomes con-
taining cinnamon oil had a high negative Zeta potential of 
−54.7 ± 2.01 mV (Figure 6). The linear regression equa-
tion between peak areas of cinnamyl aldehyde and the 
concentration of cinnamon oil was y = 36,177,941.1250 
x + 251,403.7250, R² = 0.9976 (Figure 7). Finally, AFM 
analysis was employed to observe the morphology of 
liposomes, as shown in Figure 8. The liposomes were vesi-
cles with a near spherical shape, and appeared as well-dis-
tributed particles. In addition, the AFM image indicated 
that the liposomes were nanometric in size, ranging from 
100 to 500 nm, which was consistent with the size distri-
bution. The AFM images also showed that the liposomes 
were globular and highly dispersed, without aggregation 
(Figure 8).
Anti-biofilm assay of liposomes containing 
cinnamon oil
The liposomes (concentration: 1.0 mg ml−1 and time: 
24 h) were used to eradicate the MRSA biofilms formed 
on the surfaces of stainless steel, gauze, nylon membrane 
and non-woven fabrics in TSB (Figure 9). A significant 
population reduction of MRSA cells in biofilms formed 
on the surfaces of different materials was observed after 
liposome treatment.
In addition, the anti-biofilm properties of cinnamon 
oil against MRSA on the surfaces of different materials 
were compared with those of the liposomes containing 
cinnamon oil (see Figures 10–13). In the case of biofilm 
–52.1 ± 1.29 mV. The entrapment efficiencies of liposomes 
containing cinnamon oil was also investigated. These 
ranged from 18.80 ± 1.86% to 29.20 ± 1.45%. The high-
est entrapment efficiency (29.20 ± 1.45%) was obtained 
when the cinnamon oil concentration was 5.0 mg ml−1. 
The entrapment efficiency dropped when the cinnamon 
oil concentration was > 5.0 mg ml−1. Based on the above 
findings, the liposomes with a cinnamon oil concentration 
of 5.0 mg ml−1 had the optimal PDI, Zeta potential and 
entrapment efficiency, and therefore were further studied 
in the subsequent antimicrobial tests.
Furthermore, the specific physical and chemical char-
acteristics of the optimal liposomes were determined. The 
size distribution of liposome is shown in Figure 5. The 
average particle size was 144.3 ± 1.08 nm, with a PDI of

treated with liposomes containing cinnamon oil showed 
a gradual and consecutive decrease. However, the counts 
of MRSA cells treated with cinnamon oil from two to five 
days were almost unchanged. Exposing the MRSA biofilm 
formed on a nylon membrane (Figure 11) to 1.0 mg ml−1 
cinnamon oil for one, two, three, four, and five days 
formation on stainless steel (Figure 10), after treatment 
for one day, compared to the control groups, the amount 
of viable MRSA in the biofilms treated with cinnamon oil 
was reduced by 1.49 logs. Under the same conditions, the 
liposome containing cinnamon oil reduced the number of 
MRSA cells by 2.45 logs. The number of viable MRSA cells

significantly reduced the MRSA populations from 6.48 to 
3.89, 3.80, 3.76, 3.75, and 3.70 log CFU cm−2, respectively, 
whilst the number of MRSA cells treated with liposomes 
was reduced by 3.43, 3.84, 4.36, 4.74, and 5.45 logs respec-
tively. Similarly, when MRSA biofilms formed on gauze 
(Figure 12) and non-woven fabrics (Figure 13), the anti-bi-
ofilm activity of the liposome-encapsulated cinnamon oil 
was higher than for cinnamon oil. Specifically, the counts 
of viable MRSA in biofilms formed on gauze and non-wo-
ven fabrics treated with cinnamon oil were reduced by 
2.08 and 2.82 logs after five days. Correspondingly, the 
counts of viable MRSA treated with liposome containing 
cinnamon oil was reduced by 4.55 and 5.42 logs.
SEM and LSCM analyses were used to illuminate the 
morphological changes in MRSA biofilms treated with 
liposomes. As reflected by the SEM images in Figure 14, 
the untreated biofilms adhered to the nylon membrane 
were crowded spheres. However, in contrast, there was 
an obvious decrease in the thickness and sizes of biofilms 
treated with liposomes. As reflected by the LSCM images 
in Figure 15, the fluorescence intensities of the biofilms 
treated with liposomes was much lower than the control 
samples, and 1.0 mg ml−1 of liposomes can destroy the 
biofilms formed by MRSA.
Discussion
Cinnamon oil, as a natural and non-toxic substance 
obtained from a plant resource, has been found to pos-
sess strong antimicrobial properties (Kalemba & Kunicka 
2003). In recent years, cinnamon oil has been investigated 
for its antimicrobial properties against bacteria such as 
Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica (Friedman

et al. 2002). Zhang et al. (2016) elucidated the mechanism 
of the antibacterial action of cinnamon oil against E. coli 
and S. aureus by observing the changes in cell microstruc-
ture, and the determination of cell permeability, mem-
brane integrity and membrane potential. Niu and Gilbert 
(2004) showed that cinnamon oil affected biofilm forma-
tion and the structure of E. coli. Similarly, Nuryastuti et al. 
(2009) proposed that cinnamon oil is an effective antimi-
crobial agent to combat S. epidermidis biofilms. However, 
few researchers have focused on the anti-biofilm activity 
of cinnamon oil against MRSA over the past decades. The 
aim of the present study was to investigate the potential 
application of cinnamon oil and replace the conventional 
antibiotics. It was found that the application of lipos-
omes can significantly enhance the anti-biofilm activity 
of antimicrobial agents. An efficient approach to the use 
of liposomes against MRSA infections was designed. The 
strategy proposed is depicted in Figure 16. As an antimi-
crobial agent, liposome-encapsulated cinnamon oil could 
be released slowly to kill MRSA and eliminate its biofilms.
In this study, liposomes with a small average particle size 
(144.3 ± 1.08 nm) and a high Zeta potential (< –30 mV) were 
engineered. As suggested by Cui et al. (2015) liposomes with 
smaller particle sizes (< 200 nm) can obtain a high utilization 
ratio of the entrapped compound. The surface Zeta poten-
tial is a vital parameter characterizing the dispersibility and 
stability of liposome systems. A higher Zeta potential pro-
vides a repelling force between the particles, thus increasing 
the stability of the liposomes (Kwon et al. 2003; Zhong et al. 
2012). Generally, Zeta potentials < –30 mV and > +30 mV are 
both considered as high (Lu et al. 2014). From these results, 
it could be inferred that the prepared liposomes not only

non-woven fabrics) were tested. Compared to cinna-
mon oil, the anti-biofilm activities and active time of 
liposome-encapsulated cinnamon oil were significantly 
boosted. The improvement was attributed to the improved 
stability of the essential oil by liposome encapsulation.
In conclusion, the optimal formula for preparing lipos-
ome-encapsulated cinnamon oil is a cinnamon oil concentra-
tion of 5.0 mg ml−1, and a ratio of soy lecithin to cholesterol 
of 5:1. As a natural and safe spice, cinnamon oil shows an 
excellent antibacterial effect on MRSA and MRSA biofilms. 
The introduction of liposomes can significantly improve the 
active time and the stability of cinnamon oil in the elimina-
tion of MRSA biofilms. The concept in the present study may 
be useful in the future to deliver a variety of antimicrobials 
possess favorable dispersibility and stability, but also entrap 
enough antibacterial agents.
In the experiments in this study, the MTT and CFU 
counting methods for quantification of viable MRSA 
in biofilms were applied. The results of the MTT assay 
and the CFU counting methods in the evaluation of the 
anti-biofilm activities of different agents in the biofilm 
were in agreement with each other. Both methods exhib-
ited a good correlation, and showed that a concentration 
of 1.0 mg ml−1 of cinnamon oil can effectively eradicate 
biofilms of MRSA. Subsequently, the anti-biofilm proper-
ties of cinnamon oil and liposomes containing cinnamon 
oil against MRSA on the surfaces of different materials 
(such as stainless steel, gauze, nylon membrane, and
