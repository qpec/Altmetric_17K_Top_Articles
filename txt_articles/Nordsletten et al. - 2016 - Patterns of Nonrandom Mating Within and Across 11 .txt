Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Psychiatric disorders are heritable, polygenic traits, which often share risk 
alleles and for which nonrandom mating has been suggested. However, despite the potential 
etiological implications, the scale of nonrandom mating within and across major psychiatric 
conditions remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE—To quantify the nature and extent of nonrandom mating within and across a broad 
range of psychiatric conditions at the population level.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Population-based cohort using Swedish 
population registers. Participants were all Swedish residents with a psychiatric diagnosis of 
interest (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder, major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, anorexia, or substance abuse), along with their mates. Individuals with select 
nonpsychiatric disorders (Crohn’s disease, type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, 
or rheumatoid arthritis) were included for comparison. General population samples were also 
derived and matched 1:5 with each case proband. Inpatient and outpatient diagnostic data were

 derived from the Swedish National Patient Register (1973-2009), with analyses conducted 
between June 2014 and May 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Correlation in the diagnostic status of mates both 
within and across disorders. Conditional logistic regression was used to quantify the odds of each 
diagnosis in the mates of cases relative to matched population controls.
RESULTS—Across cohorts, data corresponded to 707 263 unique case individuals, with women 
constituting 45.7% of the full population. Positive correlations in diagnostic status were evident 
between mates. Within-disorder correlations were marginally higher (range, 0.11-0.48) than cross-
disorder correlations (range, 0.01-0.42). Relative to matched populations, the odds of psychiatric 
case probands having an affected mate were significantly elevated. Differences in the magnitude of 
observed relationships were apparent by disorder (odds ratio range, 0.8-11.4). The number of 
comorbidities in a case proband was associated with the proportion of affected mates. These 
relationships were not apparent or weaker in magnitude among nonpsychiatric conditions 
(correlation range, −0.03 to 0.17).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Nonrandom mating is evident in psychiatric 
populations both within specific disorders and across the spectrum of psychiatric conditions. This 
phenomenon may hold important implications for how we understand the familial transmission of 
these disorders and for psychiatric genetic research.
The term marital resemblance refers to the observed tendency for mated pairs to be more 
phenotypically similar for a given characteristic than would be expected by chance.1 A 
modest body of literature has suggested the presence of marital resemblance for a range of 
psychiatric features2-5 and clinical diagnoses,6-8 with a small subset of this work noting 
resemblance across disorders.9,10 However, the limited range of conditions considered 
within these investigations and their collective reliance on small volunteer samples and self- 
or informant reports highlights the need for work that can assess this phenomenon in larger, 
more diverse psychiatric populations.
Psychiatric disorders are thought to stem from a complex interplay between genetic and 
environmental risk factors, with the magnitude of their respective influence varying by 
disorder, sex, and time.11,12 In this context, spousal resemblance becomes an important 
phenomenon because the pairing of individuals with a psychiatric condition (a complex trait) 
at a rate greater than chance would have population-level effects on each of these 
determinant factors: increasing the genetic variance of these offspring (from the population 
mean) while also producing familial environments that are more likely to be shaped by the 
relevant conditions.13,14 In this manner, if present, nonrandom mating could have important 
implications for our understanding of the transmission and persistence of psychiatric illness. 
Known overlaps in the genetic risks for psychiatric disorders only add to this rationale15-18 
and underscore the need to extend such examination to cross-disorder mating patterns.
The primary aim of the present study was, therefore, to extend work in this area and 
determine the extent to which nonrandom mating is present within and across a broad range 
of psychiatric conditions at the population level.

 Methods
National Registers and Sample Identification
Ethical approval was obtained from the research ethics committee at Karolinska Institutet, 
Stockholm, Sweden. The requirement for informed consent was waived because the study 
was register based and the included individuals were deidentified. Data were linked across 3 
Swedish national registers using unique personal identification numbers that have been 
assigned at birth in Sweden since 1947. The study dates were defined by the psychiatric 
outcomes of the population as defined using the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR), 
with analyses conducted between June 2014 and May 2015.
The NPR includes diagnostic information on all individuals admitted to a Swedish hospital, 
with complete nation-wide psychiatric records from 1973. Since 2001, the NPR has also 
contained data on outpatient consultations, including psychiatric care. Each consultation is 
recorded as a unique entry in the NPR, with a corresponding discharge diagnosis (as 
determined by the treating physician). These diagnoses are documented using the World 
Health Organization’s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, including ICD-8 (1969-1986), ICD-9 (1987-1996), and ICD-10 (1997 onward). 
This register has been heavily used in research, leading to standardized and validated 
protocols for selecting psychiatric populations. These protocols have been adhered to in the 
present investigation, with established codes (eMaterial in the Supplement) used to define 
cases of the following: schizophrenia,19 bipolar disorder,19 autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD),19 anorexia nervosa,19 substance abuse,19 attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD),15 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),20 major depressive disorder (MDD),19 
social phobia, agoraphobia,21 and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).21 Individuals with 
tic disorder were also selected, although small case numbers precluded examination of 
mating patterns in these populations. For purposes of comparison, cases of select 
nonpsychiatric conditions of similar incidence and age at onset were also identified, 
including Crohn’s disease,22 type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis,23 and 
rheumatoid arthritis.24,25
Case probands were defined as any individual with a diagnosis of interest as indicated by at 
least 1 relevant ICD diagnosis (2 for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) registered in the 
NPR. These diagnoses were identified using a nonhierarchical structure. Therefore, an 
individual with multiple diagnoses (eg, ASD and OCD) was permitted to appear as a “case” 
in both the ASD and OCD data sets. To each case proband, we matched 5 population 
controls on the basis of age, sex, and area of residence in Sweden at the time of the 
proband’s first diagnosis.
Mating relationships were identified through (1) a record of an individual’s marriage (Total 
Population Register, which contains demographic information [eg, sex and marital status] 
for all individuals born or living in Sweden, with complete coverage from 1968 onward) or 
(2) a record of an individual being the biological parent of a child in the Multi-Generation 
Register. Because many couples in Sweden remain in unregistered, cohabitating 
relationships, the use of the birth of a child was integral to capturing Sweden’s true “mated” 
population. Although imperfect, this process has ensured inclusion of the largest possible

 segment of these individuals. In the Multi-Generation Register, the father is defined as the 
spouse at the time of the child’s birth or, alternatively, the individual acknowledged as the 
father. Due to the register’s emphasis on biological relationships in recording parentage, all 
pairs included in the present study were heterosexual.
For each member of a mated case pair, a comparison sample was again generated and 
matched 1:5 on age, sex, and county of residence. The matching criteria also specified that 
population controls must not have the diagnosis of interest. For example, if matching for a 
man with ADHD, controls were selected from all male individuals who did not have an 
ADHD diagnosis. No further restrictions were placed to allow for representative comparison 
populations.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis was conducted using a software program (Stata, release 13; 
StataCorp LP).26 Analyses were performed by disorder, with tests repeated in each disorder-
specific population (eg, ADHD cases and their matched population controls). Individuals 
were permitted to mate more than once, with matched controls selected anew for each 
separate pairing and treated as independent in the analysis. Where relevant, the software 
program’s survey routines were used to account for the matching, with reported standard 
errors robust to this structure. To permit testing of sex-specific effects and to avert 
duplication of affected pairs, all analyses were conducted by sex.
The proportions of mated pairs in each full case and matched control sample were first 
summarized. Using the mated subsets, tetrachoric correlations—run first within and 
subsequently across disorders—were then used to evaluate the magnitude and significance 
of the relationship between mates’ diagnostic status. Simple or conditional (cross-disorder 
relationships only) logistic regressions followed to illustrate the odds of each diagnosis in 
the mates of cases relative to the odds among the mates of matched population controls. A 
final analysis then merged all of these populations by ID into a single data set to (1) test the 
relative effect of any diagnosis (in a proband) on the odds of any diagnosis in mates and (2) 
explore the relationship between the number of comorbidities (in a case proband) and the 
presence of any psychiatric diagnoses in mates.
Due to the possible confounding effects of certain comorbidities and in an effort to isolate 
the mating profile of the disorder of interest, pairs were omitted from conditional analyses if 
(1) cases had the outcome diagnosis of interest or (2) mates had the predictor diagnosis of 
interest. Therefore, if examining the odds of ADHD cases selecting mates with OCD, the 
restricted sample would exclude pairs in which case probands had a diagnosis of OCD or 
mates had a diagnosis of ADHD. Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 reflect the results of these restricted 
analyses. Where reported, significance was set at P < .001.
Results
Case Samples
The initial size of each disorder-specific sample and the proportion of these cases that mated 
is provided in Table 1 and Table 2. Across all samples, case probands showed significantly

 reduced odds of mating relative to their matched populations. The magnitude of these 
reductions varied by disorder and sex, with particularly attenuated rates observed among 
individuals with schizophrenia. Low rates of mating in ADHD, ASD, and tic disorder 
reflect, in part, the youth of these populations, with a respective 21.5%, 22.3%, and 19.6% 
of these indexes being younger than 20 years (≤2.5% for all other samples). Due to an 
insufficient number of paired cases, one disorder group (tic syndrome) was omitted from 
further analysis, while the low number of men with anorexia nervosa led to the consideration 
of mating patterns only among women.
Mating Patterns
Within each disorder sample (eg, ADHD case and control probands), the mates of both sexes 
were meaningfully correlated for diagnostic status (range, 0.11-0.48) (Figure 1). Cross-
disorder correlations (range, 0.01-0.42) were also evident, being typically lower than within-
disorder correlations. Patterns of these correlations varied for each disorder sample, although 
some clustering of pronounced interdisorder correlations was observed for the 
neurodevelopmental conditions (eg, ASD and ADHD) and, to a lesser extent, the anxiety 
disorders.
As shown in Figure 2, a disorder in a case was typically associated with a 2-fold to 3-fold 
increase in his or her mate’s odds of having the same or an alternate condition. These risks 
were compounded in select conditions, such as ADHD, ASD, and schizophrenia, although 
small samples for some analytic combinations, particularly ASD, require cautious 
interpretation (the 95% CIs are shown in eFigures 1 through 11 in the Supplement).
An analysis considering the odds of any diagnosis among the mates of case probands found 
a significant increase for both male cases (odds ratio [OR], 2.24; 95% CI, 2.21-2.27; P < .
001) and female cases (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 2.08-2.14; P < .001). The proportion of case 
probands having an affected mate increased linearly with the number of comorbidities in the 
proband (Figure 3).
Nonpsychiatric Conditions
In contrast to psychiatric samples, mating rates were consistently high among both men and 
women with nonpsychiatric diagnoses (eTable in the Supplement). Meaningful spousal 
correlations within and across these conditions were rare (correlation range, −0.03 to 0.17) 
(Figure 4), with the presence of a nonpsychiatric condition in one spouse associated with 
little increase in his or her spouse’s risk for the same or any other diagnoses (eFigure 12 in 
the Supplement). Of the 5 nonpsychiatric conditions, only multiple sclerosis showed a 
spousal correlation comparable to that observed in the psychiatric samples.
Discussion
This study aimed to describe patterns of mating in a broad range of psychiatric disorders 
using a large population-based cohort. Our results, which extend previous work in this area, 
indicate that (1) nonrandom mating is often present in psychiatric patients, (2) this mating 
exists both within and across conditions, (3) there is substantial variation in the pattern

 according to diagnosis, and (4) this phenomenon is not observed to the same degree in 
nonpsychiatric conditions.
In psychiatric samples, disorders exhibiting more marked spousal correlations and risk 
increases tended to be those that either emerge at an early age (eg, ADHD and ASD) or are 
associated with especially severe symptoms (eg, schizophrenia and substance abuse). These 
populations generally showed higher within-disorder correlations, with some also exhibiting 
marked cross-disorder correlations (eg, ADHD with ASD). Notably, some of these disorders 
(schizophrenia and ASD) are among those most likely to reduce overall reproductive 
success,19 suggesting that these phenotypes (and, by extension, genotypes) may be under 
strong negative selection in the general population while being positively selected for within 
certain psychiatric populations. This result is an important finding given its potential 
implication for the maintenance of these conditions in the general population, with the 
possibility raised that these mating patterns compensate, to some degree, for the reductions 
in fecundity observed in these same mental disorders.19
Mating patterns varied by condition, with most psychiatric samples characterized by modest 
correlations across the range of disorders, while a few showed marked relationships within a 
select set of conditions. These spousal correlations were often higher than those observed 
elsewhere for traits like personality (approximately 0.10) or height and weight 
(approximately 0.20).13,14,27,28 Disorders exhibiting the former, low-variance pattern 
included the mood disorders (eg, MDD and bipolar disorder) and select anxiety disorders 
(eg, GAD). Such a profile could account for the conflicting findings of prior resemblance 
studies1,9,29,30 in the affective and anxiety disorders, which have rarely had the large-scale 
data necessary to draw out these more subtle relationships. The few multidisorder studies9,10 
that have considered resemblance for similar patient groups have found comparable 
correlations, generally ranging between 0.1 and 0.3. In a meta-analysis31 considering 
spousal resemblance for MDD, an OR of 2.38 was reported, which is slightly higher than 
our estimate of approximately 1.80.
The general absence of these patterns in nonpsychiatric conditions is noteworthy, 
particularly given the variation of the examined conditions in terms of typical onset, course, 
and symptoms. The rates of mating success observed in these populations, even for early-
onset conditions with behavioral symptoms (eg, type 1 diabetes mellitus), suggest clear 
differences between psychiatric and nonpsychiatric conditions in regard to an affected 
individual’s mating success and selection.
Implications for Psychiatric Genetics Research
To the extent that phenotype reflects genotype, nonrandom mating of individuals who share 
a psychiatric disorder will result in mates who have a nonrandom distribution of the genetic 
variants associated with that condition. Given that a family history positive for a psychiatric 
disorder (eg, schizophrenia) has been associated with increased polygenic risk scores in 
subsequent generations,32 it seems reasonable to anticipate a meaningful increase in genetic 
variance among the offspring of these dual-diagnosis pairs. Work in population genetics 
suggests that such an increase would be specific to additive genetic variance, with this 
increase aggregating over generations in the continued presence of nonrandom mating until 
Nordsletten et al.

 equilibrium is reached.33 While this finding does not imply a determinant risk in a given 
child, at the population level, this tendency toward spousal concordance will result in a 
subpopulation of offspring who differ substantially from the genetic mean and are, as a 
whole, at heightened genetic risk for psychiatric disorders.
Most case samples also demonstrated cross-disorder mating. The genetic implications of this 
mating will differ depending on the degree to which these conditions stem from shared 
genetic risks. For instance, substance use disorders have been proposed to have largely 
unique genetic risk factors.34 In theory, this hypothesis would mean that the pairing of an 
individual with substance abuse to an individual with a different psychiatric condition would 
result only in a phenotypic, rather than genotypic, correlation. However, this degree of 
genetic heterogeneity is highly unusual for psychiatric disorders. For instance, the genetic 
risks for MDD appear to be almost entirely shared by those for GAD, while the risks for 
both ADHD and bipolar disorder are shared to a meaningful degree with 
schizophrenia.15-17,35,36 Under these circumstances, the mating of individuals with different 
conditions would have effects similar to a within-disorder pairing, increasing the 
concentration of the variants shared by these disorders while also introducing unique 
variants associated with the individual phenotypes. Offspring from these pairings would be 
at increased genetic risk for both conditions as well as for other conditions that share a 
similar liability profile.
Further work will be needed to quantify these risks, untangling their effects on offspring 
psychopathology and the maintenance of these conditions in the population. Although few, 
existing population-based examinations suggest that up to 67.5% of offspring from dual-
schizophrenia couples and 44.2% from dual–bipolar disorder couples may develop these 
disorders, suggesting strong phenotypic effects from these concentrated genetic risks.37 
Cross-pairings have been associated with attenuated, albeit still increased, proportions of 
diagnosed offspring.37 A longitudinal investigation capable of examining the mating 
mechanisms would be a valuable addition to this discussion because such genetic effects 
may aggregate and differentiate over time. Certainly, nonrandom mating could offer a 
mechanism of origin for disorder-dense pedigrees observed in the literature,38 with 
polygenic risks compounding as such mating perpetuates in a family over generations (eg, 
due to geographical or social isolation).
Finally, spousal resemblance for psychiatric conditions has implications for genetic models, 
which are usually conducted under the assumption of random mating. The presence of 
resemblance across most conditions refutes this assumption and indicates that models should 
allow for the correlation of spouses to avoid potential bias in heritability estimates (eg, in 
twin studies, where neglect of spousal correlations may underestimate heritability). The 
extra additive genetic variance also has implications for genome-wide association studies 
and single-nucleotide polymorphism–based heritability estimates because these methods are 
limited to additive genetic variance.
Limitations
Our definition of mating fails to capture some alternative pairings (eg, childless, unmarried, 
and cohabitating partners). As the registers continue to develop, better capture of these

 relationships may be anticipated. Furthermore, reliance on register diagnoses inherently 
limits our examination to individuals who have sought outpatient or inpatient care for 
psychiatric concerns, with such populations potentially constituting a unique subset of the 
whole affected population. While it is difficult to quantify the impacts of this detection bias, 
it may be noted that we have found largely comparable results for disorders that frequently 
require in patient admissions and are thus well captured in the registers (eg, schizophrenia 
and bipolar disorder) and those that are typically managed in outpatient settings and may 
therefore be more variably captured (eg, MDD and GAD). In addition, the magnitude of the 
relationships observed in our samples accord, to a large degree, with prior research 
conducted in related populations sampled using different approaches.9,10
We are also limited in the comment we can offer on the mechanisms underlying the mating 
patterns observed (eg, assortative mating vs marital interaction). Certainly, it is possible that 
the presence of a disordered behavior in one spouse (eg, alcohol dependence) could 
influence his or her mate’s consumption (interaction) or spur the development of an 
alternative condition (eg, MDD) as a reaction (contagion). Individuals with an affected mate 
may also be more likely to access services and receive their own diagnosis (detection bias). 
This being said, prior work has failed to find a relationship between marriage duration and 
either the magnitude of resemblance or the rates of spousal concordance for psychiatric 
conditions.9,10 Furthermore, the negligible shared environment effects observed in many 
heritable psychiatric conditions would favor the phenotypic assortment alternative.6 
Moreover, our finding of marked resemblance for neurodevelopmental conditions suggests a 
role for assortment in at least some populations because these conditions would be present 
over the life span.
Finally, while the samples used in this investigation are degrees of magnitude larger than 
those of prior investigations, low rates of mating in some case populations (most notably 
ASD) require conservative interpretation. Studies offering further coverage of these 
populations would be a valuable addition to this area of inquiry. Given the relationship 
observed in our samples between the number of comorbidities and the risk of nonrandom 
mating, work exploring the role of comorbidity in this phenomenon would also be of 
interest.
Conclusions
This work suggests that nonrandom mating is widespread in psychiatric populations both 
within and across the spectrum of psychiatric disorders. This phenomenon, which is not 
observed in nonpsychiatric populations, may hold important implications for how we 
understand the familial transmission of these conditions and the ubiquity of comorbidity and 
complex symptoms in clinical populations. Furthermore, the results challenge a fundamental 
assumption of current genetic research methods, suggesting that more attention to this issue 
is warranted.

 Key Points
Question
What is the nature and extent of nonrandom mating in psychiatric populations, and to 
what degree does it vary by disorder?
Findings
Nonrandom mating was widespread in psychiatric populations both within and across 
psychiatric disorders but was not observed in nonpsychiatric populations.
Meaning
This phenomenon may hold important implications for how we understand the familial 
transmission of psychiatric disorders and for genetic research.

 Figure 1. Within-Disorder and Cross-Disorder Partner Correlations, by Psychiatric Proband 
Sex, in Restricted Case Samples
The magnitude of the spousal correlations is reflected in the figure’s coloration, with darker 
boxes indicating stronger correlations between the diagnostic status of the relevant proband 
(indicated by row labels) and the corresponding diagnostic status of his or her mate 
(indicated by column labels). pXXX is the opposite-sex partner of a proband with diagnosis 
XXX. Large figures in each box reflect the correlation for that row or column, with small 
figures indicating the standard error. Large figures in bold indicate that the correlation is 
statistically significant (P < .001). Due to unique matched populations and the possibility of 
multiple pairings per individual, within-disorder correlations may be asymmetric for the 
same comparison depending on the proband sex. Empty values in ANO and pANO rows and 
columns reflect confinement of analyses to female probands or partners. ADHD indicates 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; AGO, agoraphobia; ANO, anorexia nervosa; ASD, 
autism spectrum disorder; BIP, bipolar disorder; DEP, major depressive disorder; GAD, 
generalized anxiety disorder; OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder; SCZ, schizophrenia; 
SOC, social phobia; and SUB, substance abuse.

 Figure 2. Dot Plot of Odds Ratios Illustrating Mating Patterns Within and Across Major Mental 
Disorders, by Psychiatric Proband Sex
Plotted points illustrate the increased odds, relative to matched populations, of each 
individual diagnosis among the opposite-sex partners of case probands (whose sex and 
diagnosis are labeled on the x-axis). mXXX is a male proband with diagnosis XXX, fXXX 
is a female proband with diagnosis XXX, and pXXX is the opposite-sex partner of a 
proband with diagnosis XXX. ADHD indicates attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; 
AGO, agoraphobia; ANO, anorexia nervosa; ASD, autism spectrum disorder; BIP, bipolar 
disorder; DEP, major depressive disorder; GAD, generalized anxiety disorder; OCD, 
obsessive-compulsive disorder; SCZ, schizophrenia; SOC, social phobia; and SUB, 
substance abuse.

 Figure 3. Linear Plot Depicting the Relationship of Psychiatric Proband Diagnosis (Total No.) to 
the Proportion of Partners With a Diagnosis
The proportion of case probands having an affected mate increased linearly with the number 
of comorbidities in the proband.

 Figure 4. Within-Disorder and Cross-Disorder Partner Correlations, by Nonpsychiatric Proband 
Sex, in Restricted Case Samples
The magnitude of the spousal correlations is reflected in the figure’s coloration, with darker 
boxes indicating stronger correlations between the diagnostic status of the relevant proband 
(indicated by row labels) and the corresponding diagnostic status of his or her mate 
(indicated by column labels). pXXX is the opposite-sex partner of a proband with diagnosis 
XXX. Large figures in each box reflect the correlation for that row or column, with small 
figures indicating the standard error. Large figures in bold indicate that the correlation is 
statistically significant (P < .001). Due to unique matched populations and the possibility of 
multiple pairings per individual, within-disorder correlations may be asymmetric for the 
same comparison depending on the proband sex. CD indicates Crohn’s disease; DM1, type I 
diabetes mellitus; DM2, type 2 diabetes mellitus; MS, multiple sclerosis; and RA, 
rheumatoid arthritis.
