 Multimedia Appendix 1: Automated Dialogues 
 
A key component of the mPulse Mobile platform is the Engagement Engine which uses configurable 
automated dialogues for a specific purpose.  An automated dialogue is an interactive exchange between the 
system and member with the intention of completing a task or process for the member. Automated 
dialogues can vary in purpose: refill a medication, cancel an appointment or get a health tip. The system 
supports these automated dialogues by using context within each interaction.  
 
As part of the automated dialogue, responses received from a member or patient may not exactly match 
what was requested. For example, the message might request the member to enter “1” to view their order, 
but patients frequently respond in other ways – “#1”, “1.” “Option 1” or “Reply 1.”.  Therefore, the 
automated dialogue embeds rules to handle these types of variations to continue the conversation in a 
meaningful and user-centered manner. Further enhancements include natural language processing to 
process responses. Such rules were used throughout the dialogue to accommodate for patient behavior.  The 
program implemented 34 rules based on regular expressions (regex) that look for keywords and other 
patterns within the text.  These rules match member responses and trigger a set of defined actions.  Once a 
member response has been successfully handled, the automated dialogue flow may trigger one of several 
actions: 
• 
Send a message 
• 
Update the member profile 
• 
Move them into a new state/context  
• 
Move them into a state of “unknown response”  
 
The last action allows for manual intervention such as calling the member, unsubscribing the member, 
updating their profile or moving the member through the dialogue to the desired action (e.g. refilling their 
prescription).  This manual fallback allows for both quality control as well as improving the user 
experience for those members that have difficulty using the mobile interface. The following table lists a 
few samples of rules used within the Engagement Engine:

Over one-third of the dialogues resulted in responses (37.4%) from the patients.  The following table shows 
the breakdown of the final state as recorded within the Engagement Engine. As patients responded, they 
were moved from state to state based on their response.  Pharmacy staff followed up with these patients and 
prioritized them based on internal guidelines.

* There is a difference between “refill requests” via the text solution (18.1%) and “completed refills” that were processed by 
the pharmacy staff and were slightly lower 
 
In addition to measuring response sentiment, we used natural language processing (NLP) to uncover 
whether there was any uncertainty or confusion about how to move through the refill dialogue. These NLP 
driven insights helped us to make changes to the messaging and to cut down the number of free text 
responses that reflected a lack of understanding. For example, in month 1 (December), many members 
responded that they didn’t want to refill before knowing what they would be refilling. In response to their 
concerns, we changed the message in Month 2 to make it clear that they would be able to view their order 
and then refill. But members still weren’t sure if the acts of viewing and refilling were simultaneous and 
wanted to be sure they could view before refilling. After we made another change in Month 3, there was 
less confusion.
