†Report from the ESMO Annual Meeting 2016 Copenhagen Special Symposium: Right or left metastatic colorectal cancer - ‘Will the side change your treatment?’ and from the
ESMO Asia Meeting 2016 Singapore Special Symposium: ‘Right and left colon carcinomas are different entities.’
Background: There is increasing evidence that metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is a genetically heterogeneous disease and
that tumours arising from different sides of the colon (left versus right) have different clinical outcomes. Furthermore, previous
analyses comparing the activity of different classes of targeted agents in patients with KRAS wild-type (wt) or RAS wt mCRC sug-
gest that primary tumour location (side), might be both prognostic and predictive for clinical outcome.
Methods: This retrospective analysis investigated the prognostic and predictive influence of the localization of the primary
tumour in patients with unresectable RAS wt mCRC included in six randomized trials (CRYSTAL, FIRE-3, CALGB 80405, PRIME,
PEAK and 20050181), comparing chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody therapy (experimental arm) with chemotherapy or chemo-
therapy and bevacizumab (control arms). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with left-sided versus right-sided tumours, and odds ratios (ORs) for objective
response rate (ORR) were estimated by pooling individual study HRs/ORs. The predictive value was evaluated by pooling study
interaction between treatment effect and tumour side.
Results: Primary tumour location and RAS mutation status were available for 2159 of the 5760 patients (37.5%) randomized
across the 6 trials, 515 right-sided and 1644 left-sided. A significantly worse prognosis was observed for patients with right-sided
tumours compared with those with left-sided tumours in both the pooled control and experimental arms for OS [HRs ¼ 2.03
(95% CI: 1.69–2.42) and 1.38 (1.17–1.63), respectively], PFS [HRs ¼ 1.59 (1.34–1.88) and 1.25 (1.06–1.47)], and ORR [ORs ¼ 0.38
(0.28–0.50) and 0.56 (0.43–0.73)]. In terms of a predictive effect, a significant benefit for chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody ther-
apy was observed in patients with left-sided tumours [HRs ¼ 0.75 (0.67–0.84) and 0.78 (0.70–0.87) for OS and PFS, respectively]
compared with no significant benefit for those with right-sided tumours [HRs ¼ 1.12 (0.87–1.45) and 1.12 (0.87–1.44) for OS and
PFS, respectively; P value for interaction <0.001 and 0.002, respectively]. For ORR, there was a trend (P value for inter-
action ¼ 0.07) towards a greater benefit for chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody therapy in the patients with left-sided tumours

 [OR ¼ 2.12 (1.77–2.55)] compared with those with right-sided tumours [OR ¼ 1.47 (0.94–2.29)]. Exclusion of the unique phase II
trial or the unique second-line trial had no impact on the results. The predictive effect on PFS may depend of the type of EGFR
antibody therapy and on the presence or absence of bevacizumab in the control arm.
Conclusion: This pooled analysis showed a worse prognosis for OS, PFS and ORR for patients with right-sided tumours com-
pared with those with left-sided tumours in patients with RAS wt mCRC and a predictive effect of tumour side, with a greater
effect of chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody therapy compared with chemotherapy or chemotherapy and bevacizumab, the
effect being greatest in patients with left-sided tumours. These predictive results should be interpreted with caution due to the
retrospective nature of the analysis, which was carried out on subpopulations of patients included in these trials, and because
none of these studies contemplated a full treatment sequence strategy.

Introduction
Primary tumours arising from the left and right sides of the colon
have distinct clinical and molecular characteristics [1–9], which
may be a reflection of the differences in embryological origin of the
normal tissue of the left and right sides of the colon. In particular,
the proximal colon from the caecum to a point approximately half
to two-thirds of the way along the transverse colon (right side) is
derived from the embryonic midgut, whilst the distal third of the
transverse colon to the rectum (left side) is derived from the
embryonic hindgut. Consistent with this difference in embryologi-
cal origin, gene expression microarray analysis has suggested that
biopsies of adult colonic epithelium can be reliably classified on
the basis of their gene expression profiles as being derived from
either the right or left sides of the colon [10]. Certainly, the physio-
logical functions of the right and left colon differ and exposure to
nutrients and carcinogens varies. Also, the vascular support sys-
tems for the two sides of the colon are unique with the left and
right sides of the colon being supported by the inferior and supe-
rior mesenteric arteries, respectively. However, the unique biologi-
cal functions specific to the left and right sides of the colon are not
fully understood and the pathways that initiate, control and main-
tain ‘sidedness’ remain to be fully defined [11].
The incidence rates of left- and right-sided colorectal cancers
(CRC) also differ markedly, with approximately two-thirds of
CRCs derived from the left side, and the remaining one-third
from the right side [3]. Thus, left- and right-sided CRCs are
increasingly being viewed as separate tumour types. Clinically,
this is of paramount importance, as therapeutic regimens and
treatment approaches may not be similarly effective across these
two tumour types. This is a relatively new concept, and to date,
primary tumour localization has not been a factor in guiding the
selection of the most appropriate therapy for patients with meta-
static CRC (mCRC). Also, predictive molecular signatures for
CRC treatment efficacy are largely unknown, with RAS and
maybe BRAF tumour mutation status currently the only guides
for systemic therapy decision-making [12].
Clinically, right-sided tumours are more common in women,
and are likely to be diploid, more commonly associated with poor
prognostic indicators such as RAS and BRAF tumour mutations
[13], microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype
(CIMP)-high, mutagenic metabolites of cytochrome p450, MAPK
signalling and mucinous histology [14, 15]. Left-sided tumours on
the other hand are more common in men, more commonly associ-
ated with chromosomal instability, KRAS, DCC and P53
mutations, HER1 and HER2 gene amplification, aneuploidy and
gene expression profiles consistent with sensitivity to EGFR-
targeted antibody therapy [16, 17]. Also, hereditary non-polyposis
CRC is more likely to develop on the right side of the colon, whilst
familial adenomatous polyposis is associated with the develop-
ment of tumours on the left side of the colon [14, 18].
Thus, patients with right-sided tumours are generally associ-
ated with a worse prognosis than those with left-sided tumours
[16, 19–22] and endoscopically the appearance of right- and left-
sided tumours is different [14]. Mucosal microbiota organization
is also different with invasive bacterial aggregates (biofilms) iden-
tified almost universally (89%) on right-sided tumours [23].
A recent retrospective analysis of the impact of tumour location
on clinical outcome in patients with chemotherapy-refractory
KRAS wild-type (wt) mCRC from the NCICCTG CO.17 trial [24]
showed the addition of cetuximab to best supportive care to signif-
icantly benefit patients with left-sided tumours in terms of
progression-free survival (PFS) but not those patients with right-
sided tumours, with a significant interaction between tumour loca-
tion and treatment effect (P ¼ 0.002) [24]. Other trials have now
confirmed this observation for the predictive value of tumour loca-
tion for patients with KRAS exon 2 wt, RAS wt and RAS wt/BRAF
wt disease receiving EGFR antibody therapy as part of a systemic
therapy approach [25–30]. Also, although an initial trial [31] sug-
gested that the addition of the VEGF-targeted agent bevacizumab
to chemotherapy may also primarily benefit patients with left-
sided tumours, this was not supported by the data of Loupakis
et al. [16]. Furthermore, the results of a recent prospective trial
suggested that the efficacy outcomes for bevacizumab were greatest
in patients with right-sided tumours [32].
Thus, the current pooled analysis was principally designed to
study the prognostic and predictive effects of tumour side on
overall survival (OS), PFS and objective response rate (ORR) in
patients with RAS wt mCRC who had received first-line or
second-line chemotherapy with or without EGFR-targeted
monoclonal antibodies in six randomized trials. The influence on
the results of line of therapy and inclusion or not of bevacizumab
in the control arm was also investigated.

[39] trials in patients with mCRC, based on the details of publica-
tions and slide presentations presented at an ESMO Special
Symposium held as part of the ESMO 2016 Annual Conference on
10 October 2016 in Copenhagen and at the ESMO Asia 2016 meet-
ing in Singapore on 18 December 2016. As this is a symposium
report, the trials included were based on the presented trial data and
the associated available data for the presented trials. The COIN [40],
OPUS [41] and Chinese phase III [42] trials were excluded because
no data were available with regard to primary tumour localization.
Trials
The methodological and study details for all six trials have already
been published and/or presented extensively. Briefly, in the CRYSTAL
and PRIME trials patients with a first occurrence of ‘unresectable’
mCRC were randomly assigned to receive first-line chemotherapy
with FOLFIRI6 cetuximab or FOLFOX46 panitumumab, respec-
tively [33, 34], whilst the PEAK and FIRE-3 trials investigated
FOLFOX6 plus either panitumumab or bevacizumab and FOLFIRI
plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab, respectively, in patients with
previously untreated, unresectable mCRC [35, 36]. The CALGB
80405 trial investigated chemotherapy (FOLFIRI or FOLFOX6, inves-
tigator’s choice) in combination with either cetuximab or bevacizu-
mab in patients with previously untreated mCRC [38], whilst the
20050181 trial, the only one of the six trials to investigate treatment in
the second-line setting, investigated FOLFIRI plus or minus panitu-
mumab [39]. The latter second-line trial was included to look at the
effect of primary tumour localization independently of treatment line.
In all six trials patients were deemed to be treated until disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial designs, treatment
regimens, eligibility criteria and RAS (and BRAF) mutational
analyses for all six trials, have previously been reported in detail
[33–36, 38, 39, 43–50]. All six trials had received approval from
the relevant ethics committees and were conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided informed
consent before their participation.
Patients
Patients with RAS wt (KRAS exon 2–4 wt; NRAS exon 2–4wt) dis-
ease, from the randomized CRYSTAL, PRIME, PEAK, FIRE-3,
CALGB 80405 and 20050181 trials, were selected for analysis based
on their tumour location as recorded /or reported in the individual
patient case report forms of their respective trials. Primary
tumours originating in the appendix, caecum, ascending colon,
hepatic flexure and transverse colon were classified as right-sided,
except in the case of the CALGB 80405 trial where tumours in the
transverse colon were omitted from the analysis. Primary tumours
originating in the splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon
and rectum were classified as left-sided in all six trials. If tumours
within an individual patient were sited in both left-sided and right-
sided locations and the origin could not be ascribed to either side,
the patient was excluded from the analysis.
Endpoints
The endpoints investigated were OS, PFS and ORR. The primary
endpoint for the CRYSTAL, PRIME and PEAK trials was PFS, for
the FIRE-3 trial was ORR (complete and partial responses), for
the 20050181 trial was PFS and OS and for the CALGB 80405 OS.
OS and PFS were defined as the time from randomization to
death and to disease progression or death from any cause, respec-
tively. Objective response was assessed according to RECIST ver-
sion 1.0 and centrally reviewed except for patients in the CALGB
80405 trial.
Data collection
Analyses were based on aggregated retrospective data [hazard
ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR)] comparing outcome by tumour
side in each arm or treatment arms by tumour side in patients
with confirmed RAS wt primary tumours, extracted from publi-
cations or meeting slides, or provided by the investigators. These
data were validated by the investigators before the analyses.
Statistical analysis
All the individual trial analyses were retrospective. For both prog-
nostic and predictive analyses, OS, PFS and ORR according to
treatment arm were assessed in the patient subgroups defined by
their RAS wt tumour status, according to whether the primary
tumours were right-sided or left-sided.
All variables associated with tumour localization (tumour
sidedness) were investigated. The endpoint definitions used in
the current analysis were identical to those used in the original
clinical studies. The prognostic value of tumour side was studied
by comparing patient outcome in patients with right-sided or
left-sided RAS wt tumours using the HRs and ORs in the experi-
mental arm and control arms separately. The predictive value of
tumour side was studied by comparing the HRs or ORs of the
chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody therapy (experimental) arm
versus the control arm, which was either chemotherapy alone or
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. HRs were adjusted according
to covariates, but were variable taking into account the differen-
ces between studies. The ORs were not adjusted. A HR for treat-
ment (predictive) effect of <1 and an OR of >1 favour the EGFR
antibody-containing experimental arm. A HR for prognostic
effect >1 and an OR <1 indicates a worse prognosis for right-
sided tumours. A HR/OR of interaction, which is used to summa-
rise the predictive effect, is the ratio of the HR or OR for the treat-
ment effect, i.e. right-sided divided by left-sided.
The pooling of the HRs/ORs was based on a two-step analysis
corresponding to stratified Cox proportional hazards and logistic
regression models, respectively,
with fixed effect
models.
Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochrane test (P < 0.10)
and I2 [51]. In the case of heterogeneity a random effect model
was used.
For the predictive analysis, treatment interaction tests (likeli-
hood ratio test within Cox proportional hazards and logistic
regression models, respectively) were used to assess the difference
in HRs and ORs for patients with left-sided and right-sided
tumours. The HRs/ORs of interaction were pooled as proposed
by Fisher et al. [52].
To investigate the impact of the main differences in study char-
acteristics (Table 1) on the results, the following strategies were
adopted. To investigate the impact of study phase and treatment
line, sensitivity analyses excluding the only phase II study, and
the only study of second-line treatment, respectively, were carried

 out. To compare the studies according to the choice of, EGFR
antibody therapy (cetuximab versus panitumumab) and treat-
ment modalities in the control arm (chemotherapy alone or che-
motherapy plus bevacizumab), the results of the two groups of
studies (subsets) defined by each of these characteristics were
analysed separately and compared by interaction tests. All tests
were both sided and all statistical analyses were carried out using
SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Of the 5760 patients originally randomized across the 6 trials, a
total of 2159 patients (37.6%) with RAS wt mCRC and defined
primary tumour location were included in the overall analysis
(Figure 1). These comprised: 364 from the CRYSTAL trial, 416
from the PRIME trial, 143 from the PEAK trial, 394 from FIRE-3,
474 from the CALGB 80405 trial and 368 from the second-line
20050181 trial (Table 1). Of these, 515 (23.9%) were right-sided.
Patient characteristics according to tumour location for the six
trials are presented in supplementary Tables S1 and S2, available
at Annals of Oncology online. The efficacy outcome data for the
individual trials will be presented below followed by the results of
the pooled analyses.
Efficacy outcomes according to treatment arm and
primary tumour location
Panitumumab trials. There were differences in baseline charac-
teristics between patients with right-sided tumours in the two
treatment arms of the PRIME trial in terms of liver involvement,
and in the PEAK trial in terms of Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status (ECOG PS) and liver-limited disease
(LLD) (supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology
online). Additionally, in the PEAK trial the incidence of BRAF
mutant tumours was 40.9% and 7.1% for right-sided patients in
the FOLFOX6 plus panitumumab and FOLFOX6 plus bevacizu-
mab arms, respectively. In the PRIME trial more patients with
left-sided tumours had LLD in both treatment arms and in the
PEAK trial more patients with left-sided tumours had an ECOG
PS of 0 in the panitumumab arm (supplementary Table S1, avail-
able at Annals of Oncology online). There were no marked differ-
ences in the baseline characteristics between those patients with
right-sided
and
those
with
left-sided
disease
in
the
20050181 second-line trial (supplementary Table S2, available at
Annals of Oncology online).
The prognostic HRs for OS in the chemotherapy plus panitu-
mumab arm according to primary tumour location, right- versus
left-sided, were 1.58 (1.02–2.45), 2.68 (1.31–5.46) and 2.01
(1.29–3.13) for the PRIME, PEAK and 20050181 trials, respec-
tively. In both the first- and second-line settings patients with
right-sided tumours had a worse prognosis irrespective of the
treatment received (Table 2). For all three trials the treatment
outcomes were better (numerically higher) in patients with left-
sided tumours compared with those with right-sided tumours for
OS and ORR (Table 3). This was true also for PFS in the PRIME
and 20050181 trials. In patients with left-sided tumours panitu-
mumab in combination with chemotherapy appears to be signifi-
cantly superior to chemotherapy alone in the PRIME trial for OS,

 PFS and ORR and in the 20050181 trial for ORR, and numerically
superior to bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in
terms of clinical outcomes in the PEAK trial, but this was not true
in the case of patients with right-sided tumours (Table 3).
Cetuximab trials. Numerical differences in patient baseline char-
acteristics were also observed in the CRYSTAL, FIRE-3 and
CALGB 80405 trials. In the CRYSTAL trial, fewer patients with
right-sided tumours in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab arm had an
ECOG PS of 0 and more had received prior adjuvant therapy.
Also, patients with right-sided tumours treated with FOLFIRI
plus cetuximab less frequently received second-line therapy than
patients with right-sided tumours receiving FOLFIRI alone (data
not shown). More patients with right-sided tumours in the FIRE-
3 trial had an ECOG PS of 0 in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab
arm than in the cetuximab arm (supplementary Table S1, avail-
able at Annals of Oncology online) [28]. In the CALGB 80405 trial
more patients with left-sided tumours had the primary in place,
more had liver-only disease and more had liver metastases but
less extrahepatic disease than those patients with right-sided
tumours (supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of
Oncology online).
In terms of prognosis, patients with left-sided primary
tumours were superior to those with right-sided tumours in the
CRYSTAL and FIRE-3 trials for the different treatment
combinations although, it was less pronounced for the FOLFIRI
plus bevacizumab arm than for the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab
arm in the FIRE-3 trial [28]. In the case of patients in the
CRYSTAL trial receiving FOLFIRI plus cetuximab this differ-
ence between patients with right- and left-sided tumours was
statistically significant (Table 4). In the CALGB 80405 trial clini-
cal outcomes were consistently superior for PFS and OS in
patients with left-sided tumours compared with those with
right-sided tumours (Table 4). The difference in median OS
between patients with right-and left-sided tumours treated with
chemotherapy plus cetuximab was 25.7 months in favour of
those with left-sided primaries with a statically significant HR of
1.82 (adjusted P value of 0.001).
As for the panitumumab trials, the location of a patient’s pri-
mary tumour was also associated with a difference in treatment
effect. In the CRYSTAL trial the addition of cetuximab to
FOLFIRI in the treatment of patients with RAS wt left-sided
tumours was associated with a significant improvement in OS,
PFS and ORR (Table 5) [28]. In contrast, no benefit from the
addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI was observed in terms of
treatment outcome in patients with right-sided tumours (Table
5) [28]. In the FIRE-3 trial patients with RAS wt left-sided
tumours treated with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab benefited signif-
icantly in terms of OS and PFS compared with patients with
right-sided tumours (Table 4). Indeed in the case of patients in
the FIRE-3 trial receiving FOLFIRI plus cetuximab there was a
dramatic 20-month difference in median OS favouring patients
with left-sided tumours over those with right-sided tumours
(Tables 4 and 5). Furthermore, patients with left-sided tumours
treated with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab had a significantly longer
median OS than patients with left-sided tumours treated with
FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (HR ¼ 0.63; P ¼ 0.002), whilst a
non-significant numerical advantage in ORR was observed
(Table 5). For patients with RAS wt right-sided tumours no
significant differences in ORR, PFS or OS were observed, for
those patients treated with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab versus
those treated with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (Table 5). Post
hoc statistical modelling confirmed a significant interaction
between primary tumour location and treatment of OS and PFS
but not ORR for the CRYSTAL trial and OS, but not PFS or
ORR for the FIRE-3 trial [28]. In the CALGB 80405 trial cetuxi-
mab and bevacizumab were also shown to have different treat-
ment effects according to primary tumour localization with
primary tumour localization predictive for treatment outcome
(Table 5).
Prognostic role of tumour location for patients
receiving either chemotherapy alone or
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (control arm):
pooled analysis
The pooled analyses (Figures 2A, C and E; Table 6), showed the
overall HR for OS to be 1.38 [1.17–1.63] (P < 0.001) in the
absence of any significant heterogeneity between the trials
(P ¼ 0.34; I2 ¼ 12%) showing a negative prognostic effect of
right-sided tumour location, but less pronounced than in the
experimental arm. The results for PFS were similar with an over-
all HR of 1.25 [1.06–1.47] (P ¼ 0.008; P value for hetero-
geneity ¼ 0.71; I2 ¼ 0%). Results for ORR also favoured left-sided

 Prognostic role of tumour location for patients
receiving chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody
therapy (experimental arm): pooled analysis
The pooled analyses (Figures 2B, D and F; Table 7), showed the
overall HR for OS to be 2.03 [1.69–2.42] P < 0.001 in the absence
of any heterogeneity between the trials (P ¼ 0.46; I2 ¼ 0%) con-
firming a clear negative prognostic effect of right-sided tumour
location. The results for PFS were similar with an overall HR of
1.59 [1.34–1.88] (P < 0.001; P value for heterogeneity ¼ 0.58:
I2 ¼ 0%). Results for ORR were also in favour of the left-sided
tumour location with an overall OR of 0.38 [0.28–0.50]
(P < 0.001), but with some inter study heterogeneity (P ¼ 0.08;
I2 ¼ 48%). Use of a random effect model confirmed this result
with an OR of 0.38 [0.25–0.57].
There was no significant difference (P value for inter-
action >0.05) in the prognostic effect according to which EGFR
antibody therapy was used for the three endpoints. Also, exclu-

 20050181 study data led to similar results (Table 7) for all three
endpoints. However, after exclusion of the PEAK study, there was
no longer significant heterogeneity for ORR.
Predictive role of tumour location: pooled analysis
The predictive effect of chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody ther-
apy compared with chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy plus
bevacizumab was significantly different for patients with left- and
right-sided tumours (Figure 3A and B) both for OS (HR 1.50,
P value for interaction <0.001) and PFS (HR 1.43, P ¼ 0.002).
A significant benefit of chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody ther-
apy was observed in patients with the left-sided tumours [HRs
0.75 (0.67–0.84); P < 0.001 and 0.78 (0.70–0.87); P < 0.001 for
OS and PFS, respectively] compared with no benefit in those with
right-sided tumours [HRs 1.12 (0.87–1.45); P ¼ 0.381 and 1.12
(0.87–1.44); P ¼ 0.365 for OS and PFS, respectively]. For ORR
(Figure 3C), there was a trend (P value for interaction ¼ 0.07)
towards a greater benefit for chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody
therapy in the patients with left-sided tumours [OR ¼ 2.12 (1.77–
2.55); P < 0.001] compared with those with right-sided tumours
[OR ¼ 1.47 (0.94–2.29); P ¼ 0.089]. There was no significant
inter study heterogeneity for the three endpoints.
Predictive role of tumour location according to
study characteristics
The predictive role of tumour side was not significantly differ-
ent between studies with or without bevacizumab in the control
arm in terms of OS (P for interaction ¼ 0.26, Table 8).
However, the predictive role was significant for studies with
bevacizumab (P ¼ 0.001) but was not significant for studies
without bevacizumab (P ¼ 0.09). In the studies with cetuximab
a significant predictive role of tumour side was observed
(P < 0.001), but not in those with panitumumab (P ¼ 0.47)
with a significant difference in the HR of interaction between
the two study groups (P ¼ 0.048, Table 8). With regard to PFS,
the use of bevacizumab in the control arm and the use of cetuxi-
mab instead of panitumumab in the experimental arm are asso-
ciated with different treatment effects in patients with left-sided
tumours compared with those with right-sided tumours, with
the experimental treatment superior to the control treatment in
the patients with left-sided tumours and the opposite being the
case for those with right-sided tumours. Use of bevacizumab in
the control arm and the type of EGFR antibody therapy used,
had no impact on the borderline predictive effect of tumour
side on ORR.
Exclusion of the phase II study (PEAK) or the single second-
line study (20050181) data led to similar results (Table 8) for the
three endpoints, except for the exclusion of the 20050181 study
data for ORR, when the difference between tumour sides became
non-significant.
Discussion/summary of the evidence
In relation to the prognostic value, the individual trial data for all
six trials showed treatment outcomes to be better in patients with
left-sided tumours than in those with right-sided tumours, con-
firming the evidence from previous studies [16, 19–21] and a
recent meta-analysis of 66 studies [22].
In relation to the predictive value of primary tumour loca-
tion, the individual trial data showed the treatment benefit
from the addition of EGFR antibody therapy to chemotherapy
to be greatest in those patients who had left-sided primary
tumours as seen in patients receiving chemotherapy plus
EGFR antibody therapy versus chemotherapy alone in the
first-line PRIME and CRYSTAL trials and in the second-line
20050181 trial. The individual trial data for all six trials

 showed patients with left-sided tumours receiving chemother-
apy plus EGFR antibody therapy to have superior treatment
outcomes in terms of OS, when compared with patients with
right-sided tumours receiving the same therapy. Furthermore,
patients with left-sided RAS wt tumours treated with chemo-
therapy plus EGFR antibody therapy also achieved better out-
comes in terms of response, and PFS compared with the
comparator arms in most of the six trials. Also, in the FIRE-3
and CALGB 80405 trials patients with left-sided tumours
receiving chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody therapy (cetuxi-
mab) did significantly better than those receiving chemother-
apy plus bevacizumab. Limited, if any, benefit appeared to be
conferred by the addition of EGFR antibody therapy (cetuxi-
mab) to chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with right-
sided tumours, except for the CRYSTAL trial in terms of ORR
but not PFS or OS and a trend in the second-line 20050181
trial for ORR (Tables 3 and 5). However, analysis of treatment
outcome for patients with right-sided tumours in the individ-
ual FIRE-3 trial (Table 5) suggested that patients with right-
sided RAS wt tumours might benefit from chemotherapy plus
bevacizumab compared with cetuximab in terms of OS (HR
1.31, P ¼ 0.27) and PFS (HR 1.44, P ¼ 0.11), but not for ORR.
Thus, these data suggest that there may be a subset of patients
with RAS wt tumours that might benefit from treatment with
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in terms of PFS and OS,
namely those with right-sided tumours.
Certainly, the present pooled analysis confirmed the observa-
tion that left-sided tumour localization was associated with an
anti-EGFR (cetuximab) disease control expression signature [17,
53]. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in prognosis
depending on which EGFR antibody therapy was used or if beva-
cizumab was or was not used in the control arm. Conversely, the
predictive effect depended significantly (test of interaction <0.05
for OS and PFS) on which EGFR antibody therapy was used. A
significant predictive effect was observed in the subset of trials
involving cetuximab where comparison of the treatment arms
favoured the experimental arm in patients with left-sided
tumours and the control arm in those with right-sided tumours
(Table 8), but not in the case of patients receiving panitumumab.
Also, a significant effect of the presence or absence of bevacizu-
mab in the control arm was observed at least for PFS (Table 8),
but as the variations in the treatment used in the control and
experimental arms were not independent (Table 1), it is difficult
to draw conclusions.
Thus, the pooled analysis data strongly suggest that patients
with left-sided RAS wt tumours achieve a benefit from being
treated with chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody therapy that is
not seen in those with right-sided tumours. The question is, given
the fact that not all the trials involving chemotherapy plus EGFR
antibody therapy were included in the analysis and the potential
selection biases associated with a retrospective analysis of aggre-
gated data from mCRC patients initially accrued independently
of RAS analysis and that only involved 37.5% of the patients
randomized in the six trials selected (based on the available data
for tumour RAS mutation status and tumour sidedness), can
these data be used to support a change in clinical practice?

 Certainly, the absence of stratification according to tumour side
and RAS mutation in the different trials, the heterogeneity of the
treatments compared in the six trials (which impact on some of
the results), as well as the presence of some imbalances in the
covariates between the two arms when considering separately the
patients with right-sided and left-sided tumours (supplementary
Tables S1 and S2, available at Annals of Oncology online) and the
variation in the adjustment of these covariables from one trial to
another, lend a note of caution to the interpretation of these
results. Also, the increased HRs in the studies with bevacizumab
included in the control arm mentioned above, suggesting that
bevacizumab might be more beneficial in patients with right-
sided tumours, could be a consequence of either a poorer out-
come in patients receiving EGFR antibody therapy or a better
outcome in those receiving bevacizumab. Unfortunately, as it
would be inappropriate to make cross trial comparisons between
the FOLFIRI control arm of the CRYSTAL trial and the FOLFIRI
plus bevacizumab arm of the FIRE-3 or the FOLFOX arm of the
PRIME trial and the FOLFOX plus bevacizumab arm of the
PEAK trial, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Also, it should be
noted that the influence of tumour BRAF mutation status was
not investigated as these data were not available for the patients
in three of the trials and the pooling of the data for the remaining
three trials would involve small patient numbers, particularly for
patients with right-sided tumours, rendering the results of any
analysis unreliable.
The predictive effect of primary tumour location for EGFR-
antibody therapy in patients from the PRIME and CRYSTAL tri-
als with chemotherapy in the control arm, conducted as part of a
recently published meta-analysis on the prognosis and efficacy of
targeted agents according to tumour sidedness also reached the
conclusion that left-sided primary tumour localization was pre-
dictive of a benefit from the addition of EGFR-antibody therapy
to standard chemotherapy in terms of OS, PFS and ORR in
patients with RAS wt tumours [54]. The test for interaction
between treatment efficacy and sidedness however did not reach
statistical significance. A separate meta-analysis of data from the
FIRE-3, CALGB 80405 and PEAK trials with bevacizumab-
containing control arms was also carried out, and the results and
conclusions were generally in line with our own results.
What implications will these data have for our
clinical practice?
As mentioned previously the data presented in this manuscript
are derived from unplanned retrospective analyses. However, not
all decisions relating to the development of treatment algorithms
have the benefit of being supported by top level evidence, and
previous examples of pragmatic decision-making in the treat-
ment of patients with mCRC have included for example the
choice of first-line treatment for the ‘conversion’ of colorectal
liver metastases to resectability based on patient series and cross-
trial comparisons [55], the use of new non-validated treatment
indicators such as depth of response and early tumour shrinkage
[56], the best treatment of patients with BRAF mutant disease
based on an unplanned subgroup analysis of a subgroup of <30
patients in a randomized trial and observational data [57], and
others.
The most recent ESMO consensus guidelines [12] define
tumour characteristics, patient characteristics and treatment
characteristics as the drivers of decision-making in the first-line
treatment setting, as well as therapeutic goal differentiating
between ‘disease stabilization’ and the necessity for tumour vol-
ume reduction. Along with RAS and BRAF tumour mutation sta-
tus, tumour biology is also listed as a differentiation factor, and
this analysis strongly contributes to the evidence suggesting that
there is a clear difference in tumour biology between tumours of
the right and left sides of the colon. Currently the preferred treat-
ment option for patients with RAS wt/BRAF wt (all wt) tumours
is doublet chemotherapy plus EGFR antibody therapy and possi-
bly, in very selected patients, FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab.
However, it was argued based on the evidence from both, the
individual trial findings, and the present prognostic and predic-
tive pooled analysis data, that a distinction needs to be made
between the treatment approaches for patients with right- versus
left-sided tumours.
For the treatment of patients with left-sided RAS wt (BRAF wt)
tumours going forward the preferred therapy option for patients
would be a chemotherapy doublet plus EGFR antibody therapy,
independent of treatment goal, for the majority of patients.
In the case of patients with right-sided RAS wt tumours the
preferred therapy option for patients where cytoreduction is the
goal would be a chemotherapy triplet (e.g. FOLFOXIRI) with
bevacizumab. However, given the findings from the analysis of
ORR here, a doublet plus EGFR antibody therapy remains an
option. For patients where disease stabilization is the goal a che-
motherapy doublet with or without bevacizumab would be the
treatment of choice, and due to the poorer outcomes associated
with patients with right-sided tumours, intensification to a che-
motherapy triplet could be considered.
Independent from tumour localization, RAS mutant tumour
status is known to be a very strong negative predictor for EGFR
antibody therapy whilst, RAS wt tumour status is a relatively
strong predictive marker for the efficacy of EGFR antibody ther-
apy [43, 45, 46, 58]. BRAF tumour mutations are strong negative
prognostic markers but might be (non-significant) predictive
markers for intensive therapy [57].
Therefore, with all of the caveats resulting from this analysis,
which was carried out retrospectively, and involved a limited
number of patients from the individual trials, a relatively small
number of right-sided patients, and—most importantly—did
not consider a preference for distinct treatment sequences, as
only the randomization to the respective treatment line was ana-
lysed, it provides evidence in the first-line treatment setting to:
(i)
Reinforce the use of EGFR antibody therapy in patients
with mCRC and left-sided RAS wt tumours.
(ii)
Promote the idea that patients with right-sided RAS wt
tumours might be better treated with chemotherapy alone
or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab—except maybe if the
goal is tumour size reduction as the ORRs were higher
(but not PFS and OS).
(iii)
Emphasise that in the absence of data on specific treatment
sequences, there is no reason that EGFR-antibody therapy
should be avoided in cases of disease progression or
treatment intolerance independent of primary tumour
location.

 (iv)
Promote the concept of a ‘continuum of care’ and the
sequential use of all therapies, including bevacizumab where
appropriate, in the treatment of patients with mCRC.
However, the developmental, genetic, physiological and bio-
logical differences associated with the different locations in the
colon and rectum are clearly more complex than simple right-
and left-sidedness and one might predict that a comprehensive
evaluation of molecular features in left- and right-sided CRCs
will contribute to improvements in treatment outcomes in the
future. Going forward, new randomized controlled trials should
have to stratify patients according to primary tumour location
and if the sequence in which the currently available therapies are
delivered matters we need more trials based on tumour location
and molecular characteristics.
