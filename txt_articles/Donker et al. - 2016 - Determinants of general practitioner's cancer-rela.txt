ABSTRACT
Background: General practitioners (GPs) use gut
feelings to diagnose cancer in an early stage, but little
is known about its impact.
Method: Prospective cohort study of patients in 44
general practices throughout the Netherlands, from
January 2010 until December 2013. GPs completed a
questionnaire regarding gut feelings, patient and GP
characteristics, if they noticed a cancer-related gut
feeling during patient consultation. Follow-up
questionnaires were sent 3 months later requesting
information about the patient’s diagnosis. χ2, univariate
and multivariate logistic regression and multilevel
analyses were performed.
Results: A gut feeling (N=366) is most often triggered
by weight loss (24%, N=85) and rare GP visits (22%,
N=76), but all triggers were not predictive of cancer in
a multivariate analysis. Most GPs (95%) acted
immediately on the gut feeling, either referring to a
specialist or by performing additional medical tests.
The average positive predictive value of cancer-related
gut feeling was 35%, and it increased with 2% for
every year a patient becomes older, and with 3% for
every year a GP becomes older.
Conclusions: GP’s gut feeling for cancer proves to be
a useful tool in diagnosing cancer and its relative high
predicting value increases if the GP is older or more
experienced and when the patient is older. How can
younger GPs be trained to increase the predictive value
of their gut feeling?
In Europe, an estimated 3.45 million per-
sons were diagnosed with cancer in 2012.1
Approximately half of the patients survive
cancer. Survival is slowly increasing, partially
due to earlier diagnosis.2 3 In countries with
a relatively strong primary care system, most
of the initial consultations for cancer are
with general practitioners (GPs).4 In refer-
ring patients suspected of cancer, GPs need
to find a balance between taking no risks
(referring everyone) and taking too many
(referring only those with high suspicion).
Taking
no
risks
may
cause
high
costs,
increase
patient
anxiety
and
exceeding
healthcare capacity, taking too many risks
may lead to delayed diagnosis and poorer
survival.5
GPs often use analytical cognitive processes
to become aware of cancer, through applying
medical
knowledge
and
assessing
alarm
symptoms.6 However, two studies showed that
only one out of three patients show early
warning signs of cancer,7 and one out of
eight present with alarm symptoms on the
initial consultation with the GP
.8 These per-
centages show the difficulty of diagnosing
cancer with only the help of analytical pro-
cesses. Therefore, many GPs also use non-
analytical processes to diagnose cancer: they
use their intuition build on professional
experiences and their own or patient’s fear
of cancer.6
One of these non-analytical processes to
use in diagnostic reasoning is described by
Stolper, named ‘gut feeling’: ‘The gut feeling
emerges as a consequence of non-analytical process-
ing of available information and knowledge’.9
Gut feeling, as a sense of alarm, is defined
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is the first study to analyse cancer-related
gut feelings quantitatively combining triggers of
the gut feeling, general practitioner (GP) and
patient characteristics.
▪ The prospective design enabled analyses of the
temporal sequence between the suspicion of
cancer and the actual diagnosis preventing selec-
tion bias.
▪ The multilevel analysis adjusts for clustering of
patients within 59 GPs.
▪ A study limitation is the relatively small sample
size per GP.
▪ Gut feelings are probably underreported, since it
could be a subconscious process and GPs had
to work with a newly created International
Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) code and
complete questionnaires during routine clinical
practice activities.

 as: ‘an uneasy feeling perceived by a general practitioner as he
or she is concerned about a possible adverse outcome, even
though the specific indications are lacking’.10 11 GPs appear
to value this gut feeling, since they respond to the feeling
by adjusting their actions. A clear correlation exists
between suspicion of cancer and more referrals, more
(imaging)
investigations
and
more
GP
visits.12
13
Specialists also appear to value the gut feelings, since
most specialists would accept a referral based on only the
gut feeling of a GP
, especially when the GP is older.14
Qualitative
research
has
been
done
concerning
gut feelings, but hardly any quantitative study, especially
concerning GP characteristics. To enhance the early
diagnosis of cancer, we performed a prospective quanti-
tative study exploring the gut feeling. The following
questions were investigated:
1. What triggers the cancer-related gut feeling of a GP?
2. Based on the gut feeling, which diagnostic actions
are taken by the GP?
3. What is the predictive value of cancer-related gut feel-
ings of GPs measured 3 months later?
4. How is the predictive value of GP’s gut feeling
influenced by specific triggers, patient and GP
characteristics?
METHODS
GP practices and data collection
Data for this dynamic prospective cohort study were col-
lected from the Sentinel Practices of NIVEL Primary
Care Database.15 This network of GPs, existing since
1970, is designed to be nationally representative by age
and sex of the patient, regional distribution and popula-
tion density. Data collection took place from January
2010 until December 2013 in 44 general practices with a
total population of 119 882 patients (at the beginning of
2013), representing 0.7% of the Dutch population.16 17
In December 2009, every participating GP was informed
about this study through mailing followed by more
detailed instructions in a face-to-face meeting 1-month
later. Annually the GPs received a mailing to remind
them about the continuation of this study up to 2013.
The GPs were instructed to fill in a questionnaire
throughout the year if they noticed a gut feeling con-
cerning any kind of cancer, independent of the pres-
ence of clinical signs or symptoms. Gut feelings related
to other subjects, for example partner violence, were
not included in the study. This broad definition of
gut feeling was based on earlier
work of Stolper
concerning gut feelings in focus groups of GPs.10 11 In
the Netherlands, diagnoses are recorded using the
International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), and
the GPs were instructed to use a special ICPC code
(A29) for gut feelings. If NIVEL didn’t receive a ques-
tionnaire 2 weeks after a reported case, a reminder was
sent to the GP
. The questionnaire included open-ended
questions concerning patient and GP characteristics, the
predicted type of cancer, the gut feeling triggers and
GP’s interventions in response to the gut feeling. After
3 months, a follow-up questionnaire was sent to the GP
evaluating the patient’s diagnosis. Patient data were
anonymised, guaranteeing the patient’s privacy before
questionnaires left the practice.
Statistical analyses
The survey results were analysed using Stata V.13.0.
Descriptive statistics of the triggers of gut feelings and
diagnostic actions were applied. To assess the predictive
value of gut feeling, the percentage of patients diag-
nosed with cancer after 3 months was calculated. χ2 ana-
lyses and univariate logistic regression analyses were
performed with cancer outcome after 3 months as the
dependent variable. The independent variables were
patient characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity and how
long and how well the patient was known by the GP),
GP characteristics (gender, age and years of experience)
and triggers of the gut feeling (like ‘unexplained weight
loss’ and ‘rarely consulting the GP’). Missing data
weren’t included in the analyses. To compose a predic-
tion model, each variable was first individually tested
through univariate analyses. Second, all variables from
the univariate analyses with a p<0.10 were used for a
multivariate logistic regression analysis and for a multi-
level mixed effect logistic regression analysis. The GP
was entered as a level in the multilevel analysis, to adjust
for GP variation in patient population. Statistical signifi-
cance was defined as a p<0.05.
RESULTS
Study population
A total of 366 questionnaires were completed in 44
general practices, by 59 different GPs. About 1–60
surveys were completed per GP
, with an average of 5.6
surveys. Of the 366 questionnaires, most were filled-out
by male GPs (74%), with a mean age of 50 years and
17 years of experience. Regarding the patients, 175
(48%) were female and most were of Dutch origin
(93%). Half of the patients were between 61 and
80 years old and GPs indicated that they knew these
patients (81%) very well or quite well (table 1). The
patient population of the sentinel practices fluctuated
between 119 822 in 2013 and 134 415 in 2010, respect-
ively 0.7–0.8% of the total Dutch population with nation-
wide regional distribution, but slight over-representation
of the northern part of the country.17
Triggers causing the gut feeling and actions based on the
gut feeling
Weight loss (24%, N=85), rare GP visits (22%, N=76)
and duration of symptoms (19%, N=64) were frequent
triggers for the gut feeling as reported by the GP
(figure 1). These triggers resulted in a cancer diagnosis
in a quarter of the patients after 3 months (25–28%).
Gut feelings triggered by a palpable tumour, abnormal
test results and a suspect medical history of the patient

 showed the highest proportion of diagnosed cancer,
respectively 47%, 42% and 39% in univariate analyses.
Most GPs acted immediately on the gut feeling, only
5% decided to perform watchful waiting. The majority
of the patients (N=234, 64%) were referred to a special-
ist and in two-third of the cases the GP made it a (semi)
urgent referral. Instead or along with the referral, 118
patients (32%) had a laboratory test, 77 (21%) were sent
for X-ray and 49 (13%) had an ultrasound examination.
Predictive value of the gut feeling in univariate analyses
Of the 366 patients, 118 (35%) had a cancer diagnosis
after 3 months and the diagnosis was unknown in 30
patients. The univariate analyses (table 2) showed that
the positive predictive value of the GP’s cancer-related
gut feeling was related to two patient characteristics: how
long the GP knows the patient and patient’s age. When
the GP knew the patients for >10 years (N=196), 41%
had proven cancer within 3 months, an increase of 13%
compared with those where the GP knew the patient
<10 years (p=0.01). The odds for an accurate gut feeling
increased with a factor 1.04 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.06,
p=0.004) for every year the GP knew the patient and
with a factor 1.02 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.03, p=0.03) for
every year a patient becomes older.
GP’s age and years of experience showed significant
influences on the predictive value of the gut feeling.
GPs older than 50 years had an accurate gut feeling in
43% of the cases, 16% higher compared with younger
GPs (p=0.004) (figure 2). When GPs had >15 years of
experience, 43% of the patients had proven cancer after
3 months, an increase of 17% compared with those with
<15 years of experience (p=0.006). The odds for an
accurate gut feeling increased with a factor 1.04 (95%
CI 1.01 to 1.07, p=0.007) for every year a GP becomes
older and a factor 1.04 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.08, p=0.002)
for every year of additional experience.
Of the 11 triggers causing the gut feeling, only the
palpable tumour was a statistically significant predictor
of cancer; 48% of the patients with a palpable tumour
had cancer after 3 months (p=0.03). Weight loss was
nearly statistically significantly less frequently predicting
cancer, with 27% of the patients having cancer after
3 months (p=0.07) as well as patients who rarely visited
the GP; 26% of them had cancer (p=0.07).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis and multilevel
analyses
The following variables were entered in one multivariate
logistic regression model: palpable tumour, weight loss,
rare GP visits, patient’s and GP’s age. Owing to a high
correlation between GP’s age and ‘years of experience’
(correlation 0.91) and GP’s age and ‘how long the GP
knows the patient’ (correlation 0.47), the ‘years of
experience’ and ‘how long the GP knows the patient’
were excluded from the analysis. In this multivariate
model, only the patient’s age and GP’s age remained sig-
nificant; with the odds increasing with a factor 1.02 for
every year, a patient becomes older and a factor 1.03
every year, a GP becomes older (table 3). The Spearman
correlation between patients’ and GPs’ age is 0.12
(p=0.03). Older doctors tend to have slightly older
patients. When repeating the multivariate analyses after
exclusion of all patients with a palpable tumour, the
ORs of 1.02 for patient’s age and 1.03 for GP’s age
remained the same with slightly wider 95% CIs due to
smaller numbers (N=284).
A multilevel regression analysis (table 4) was con-
ducted with a GP level added to the multivariate model.
Dependent and independent variables were the same as
in the multivariate logistic regression model. The ORs

 remained similar, but only the age of the patient was sig-
nificant, even though the other variables still had a
p<0.10. The complete model did not show significant
differences between GPs. When age of patients and age
of GPs were removed from the model there was a signifi-
cant difference between GPs; 7% of variation was at GP
level
(p=0.03).
Thus,
differences
between
GPs
are
largely due to differences in age of GPs.
DISCUSSION
This study showed that the triggers for cancer-related
gut feelings are diverse. Frequent triggers are weight loss
and patients who rarely visit the GP
, but none of these
triggers were predictive of cancer 3 months later in
multivariate analyses. Most GPs (95%) acted immedi-
ately on the gut feeling, either by referring the patient
to a specialist or by performing additional medical tests
which is reassuring to the community. The gut feeling’s
predictive value for cancer was 35%, and it increased
with patient’s and GP’s age.
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this study is the first study quantita-
tively analysing cancer-related gut feelings, combining
triggers of the gut feeling, as well as GP and patient
characteristics. The use of a long running nationally rep-
resentative network of GPs and the prospective design
enabled analyses of the temporal sequence between the
suspicion of cancer and the actual diagnosis, thereby
preventing selection bias.
The
multilevel
analysis
adjusts
for
clustering
of
patients within 59 GPs. A study limitation is the relatively
small sample size per GP
. Thus, the 44 practices were
not added as a level to the model, so dependency of
GPs within practices could not be adjusted for. Some
GPs contributed multiple submissions. The question-
naire about the 3 months outcome may have made
them more aware about the accuracy of their gut feeling
and may thus have influenced their response in subse-
quent cases. Another limitation of this study was the lack
of a control group. Although a case–control study may
be feasible by using a matched random sample as the
control group, it would not contribute in answering the
questions of this exploratory study.
The large variation in the number of gut feelings GPs
reported probably reflected interpersonal differences in
recognising gut feelings, interest in the subject and
devotion to completing surveys. The gut feeling is prob-
ably under-reported by many GPs; since it could be a
subconscious process, GPs had to work with a newly
created ICPC code and complete questionnaires during
routine clinical practice activities.
Although most medical professionals are familiar with
gut feelings,18 their definition is not easy. Stolper
explained the gut feeling as a sense of alarm with ‘specific
indications for a serious disease lacking’.10 In another study,
he explained that the gut feeling ‘effectuates the GP to take
extra time to consider the analytical and non-analytical
aspects’.9 This last definition allows the presence of clin-
ical symptoms additionally to gut feelings. The GPs in
this study were asked to complete a survey whenever a
gut feeling arose, independently, but not necessarily in
the absence of clinical symptoms. This may be seen as
study strength and a limitation. Is it possible to disentan-
gle gut feelings from an unpleasant feeling when clinical
symptoms are possibly indicating cancer? If clinical
symptoms clearly point towards cancer, how much value
does the gut feeling attribute? We may have overesti-
mated the predictive value of the gut feeling. On the
other hand, GPs were only asked to complete a question-
naire if they clearly noticed a gut feeling and the result-
ing predictive value is the consequence of the definition
used.
Comparison with existing literature
Other studies support the existence of cancer-related
gut feelings and the high prevalence of GPs acting on
gut feeling as found in our study.10 11 13 18 Ingeman
et al19 found that one out of four patients with serious
non-specific symptoms and signs of cancer referred to a
special cancer pathway, had gut feeling as a reason of
referral. They also found that patients referred with a
lump or tumour had a high probability of cancer

 (26.9%).19 So our study and those of Green and
Ingeman show that gut feelings triggered by a palpable
tumour certainly identify patients at higher risk for
cancer.
The predictive value of the cancer-related gut feeling
was 35%, this is in line with a previous study from
Donker and Dorsman in a smaller sample, who also
found a predictive value of 35%.12 Hjertholm et al13
found a predictive value of 16.4% for suspicion of
cancer. Another Norwegian study found that 3.8% of
the suspected cancer cases had a cancer diagnosis and
that GPs’ correct cancer suspicions were six times more
frequent than their erroneous lack of suspicion.20 The
difference
between
these
percentages
could
be
explained by the duration of the studies. The GPs in
Norway only registered consultations for either one
workday or ten workdays, while the data collection in
our study lasted 4 years. The follow-up in the Norwegian

BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012511 on 13 September 2016. Downloaded from 
 studies was, on the other hand, 3 months longer than
our 3 months follow-up.
Ingeman showed that 16.2% of the Danish people
sent towards the cancer pathway outpatient clinic for
patients with serious non-specific symptoms eventually
had cancer.19 A possible explanation for this lower
outcome is that in our study the GP always had a gut
feeling for cancer, while that wasn’t conditional in
Ingeman’s study. In addition,
Ingeman found
that
patients referred by the GP with a strong to very strong
gut feeling had a higher probability of cancer compared
with those referred without.
An interesting finding is the increasing predictive value
of the gut feeling for cancer for older and more experi-
enced GPs, independently of GPs’ gender. Apparently
the gut feeling isn’t a static phenomenon, but a GP can
learn by experience. This is in line with a focus group
study from Stolper, reporting that specialists in the hos-
pital regarded experience as an important condition to
develop and rely on the gut feeling.14 Stolper also
observed a supervisor assuring his GP trainee that experi-
ence enhances the GP to trust his gut feeling more.21
None of these findings were tested in a quantitative study,
however, making our study quite unique.
Another finding in our study was the increasing value
of the gut feeling for older patients. To our best knowl-
edge, no other studies have observed this finding,
although the result is not unexpected because older
patients generally have a higher incidence of cancer
than younger patients.22 This could mean that the pre-
dictive value of the gut feeling doesn’t actually increase
due to patients’ older age, but that the main effect is
due to the increased incidence of cancer.
Implications for research and practice
Our results show that gut feelings are a valuable diagnos-
tic tool for cancer with a predictive value of 35%.
Shapley et al23 considered a symptom with a predictive
value >5% as a highly predictive symptom. Thus, our
findings indicate that the gut feeling has an added value
as a diagnostic tool. For older and more experienced
GPs, the cancer-related gut feeling is even a better pre-
dictor, revealing the value of professional experience.
Assimilating experiences over time may turn gut feelings
into a conscious analytical process and enhance the use
of these feelings as a diagnostic tool by older GPs.
Future studies with a larger study population increas-
ing the study power, would enable analyses to assess vari-
ation in positive predictive value for different types of
cancers. Questions remain about gut feeling triggers
and interdoctor variation. A questionnaire study of clin-
ical vignettes may reveal more about interdoctor vari-
ation.
A
question
also
arose
about
the
increased
predictive value of the gut feeling for older GPs: ‘How
can younger GPs be trained to increase the predictive
value of their gut feeling?’. More research on this topic
is highly recommended in order to improve the early
diagnosis of cancer and the survival rate of patients.
