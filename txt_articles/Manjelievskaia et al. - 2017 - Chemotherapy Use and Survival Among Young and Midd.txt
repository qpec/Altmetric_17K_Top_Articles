IMPORTANCE Treatment options for patients with young-onset colon cancer remain to be
defined and their effects on prognosis are unclear.
OBJECTIVE To investigate receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy by age category (18-49, 50-64,
and 65-75 years) and assess whether age differences in chemotherapy matched survival gains
among patients diagnosed as having colon cancer in an equal-access health care system.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study was based on linked and consolidated
data from the US Department of Defense’
s Central Cancer Registry and Military Heath System
medical claims databases. There were 3143 patients aged 18 to 75 years with histologically
confirmed primary colon adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 1998 and 2007. This study
was conducted from December 2015 to August 2016.
EXPOSURES Patients who underwent surgery and postoperative systemic chemotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure of the study was overall
survival of patients who only received surgery and those who received both surgery and
postoperative systemic chemotherapy.
RESULTS Of the 3143 patients, 1841 were men (58.6%). Young (18-49 years) and middle-aged
(50-64 years) patients were 2 to 8 times more likely to receive postoperative systemic
chemotherapy compared with older patients (65-75 years) across all tumor stages.
Middle-aged patients with stage I (odds ratio, 5.04; 95% CI, 2.30-11.05) and stage II (odds
ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.58-3.72) disease were more likely to receive postoperative
chemotherapy compared with older patients. Both groups were more likely to receive
multiagent chemotherapy than were older patients (patients aged 18-49 years: odds ratio,
2.48; 95% CI, 1.42-4.32 and patients aged 50-64 years: odds ratio, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.70-4.18).
Among patients who received surgery and postoperative systemic chemotherapy, no
significant differences were observed in survival among age groups (the 95% CIs of hazard
ratios included 1 for young and middle-aged patients compared with older patients for all
tumor stages).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In an equal-access health care system, we found potential
overuse of chemotherapy among young and middle-aged adults with colon cancer. The
addition of postoperative systemic chemotherapy did not result in matched survival
improvement.

olorectalcanceristhethirdleadingcauseofcancermor-
talityintheUnitedStates,withanexpected134 490new
cases and 49 190 deaths in 2016.1 While incidence and
mortality rates of colorectal cancer among adults aged 50 years
and older have decreased in the United States in recent years,2
the same trend has not been observed for patients aged 20 to
49 years. The decreased mortality among people aged 50 years
or older may be related to the use of colorectal cancer screen-
ing recommended for individuals in this age group.3-5 How-
ever, survival studies have shown inconsistent results. While
some studies showed poorer survival for young patients as
compared with their older counterparts,6,7 others found bet-
ter or comparable survival among younger patients.8-13
Effective treatment increases survival from colon cancer.
While surgery is the primary curative option for patients with
stage II or III colon cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy is recom-
mended for stage III and IV tumors.14-18 For some patients with
stage IV colon cancer, chemotherapy may be used as primary
treatment.19 While among patients with stage III colon can-
cer, adjuvant chemotherapy regimens significantly increase
disease-free survival,14-16 less is known about the benefits of
adjuvant chemotherapy use in patients with earlier-stage
cancers13,20 because some studies have shown no significant
improvement in survival.21,22 Thus, routine adjuvant chemo-
therapy is currently not the standard of care,17,18 and its use
remains controversial for early-stage colon cancer.9 Neverthe-
less, a considerable proportion of patients are still receiving
this treatment.20,23 It is possible that chemotherapy is over-
used in clinical practice without substantial gain in survival.
Because prognosis of colon cancer among young patients
is not well known, it is difficult to advise about adjuvant
chemotherapy,13 and treatment options for these patients re-
main unclear.24 Thus, overuse of chemotherapy may be more
likely for younger patients. A study by Kneuertz et al13
found that young patients are more likely to receive aggres-
sive therapies, such as multiagent chemotherapy regimens,
regardless of their tumor stage at diagnosis. This treatment
approach has not resulted in matched survival gains and the
study findings suggest overtreatment of younger patients
with colon cancer.13
Receipt of treatment is related to a patient's insurance sta-
tus and access to medical care. In regard to adjuvant treat-
ment of cancer, patients with private insurance may receive
adjuvant treatment more frequently than those with no in-
surance or government-sponsored insurance,20,25 and pa-
tients with Medicare may be more likely to receive chemo-
therapy than those with Medicaid and private insurance
plans.26 Insurance status may vary by age and thus may con-
found comparisons of different age groups in adjuvant treat-
ment. As shown in the study by Kneuertz et al,13 young pa-
tients with colon cancer were less likely to be insured and more
likely to have Medicaid or other government insurance.13 Their
study adjusted for insurance status to reduce its potential con-
founding effects on age comparisons in adjuvant chemo-
therapy and survival. Nevertheless, because the study was
based on a nationwide database, there were extensive differ-
ences in health insurance. Thus, it remains unclear whether
there was potential residual confounding by insurance status
and types, which vary in many aspects such as coverage, out-
of-pocket costs, and accessible medical facilities.
Therefore, a study that compares receipt of adjuvant che-
motherapy among different age groups in an equal-access
health care system, in which members are more similar and
have comparable access to medical care, is warranted. An ex-
amination in an equal-access health care system can mini-
mize the potential effects of insurance status and types, thus
providing additional evidence concerning the effect of age on
the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and its benefits.
The US Department of Defense (DoD) Military Health Sys-
tem (MHS) provides universal health care to its beneficiaries
including active-duty members, retirees, and their depen-
dents, making it an ideal setting to assess whether differ-
ences in cancer treatment and survival exist among patients
diagnosed as having colon cancer. Many MHS beneficiaries re-
ceive free care. Although some plans have out-of-pocket costs
(enrollment fees, deductibles, copayments, and insurance pre-
miums), these costs are much lower than those for civilian
health plans. In 2013, annual out-of-pocket costs for families
of active-duty members and retirees younger than age 65 years
who were enrolled in TRICARE Prime were $93 and $976, re-
spectively, while the corresponding costs were $5463 and
$5905 for their civilian health maintenance organization
counterparts.27 Therefore, the DoD health care system pro-
vides a unique opportunity to assess the relationship be-
tween age and adjuvant chemotherapy in an equal-access
setting.
The objective of this study was to use data from the medi-
cal claims database and cancer registry of the DoD to investi-
gate receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy by age category and as-
sess whether age differences in treatment matched survival
gains among patients diagnosed as having colon cancer.

Key Points
Question Are young and middle-aged persons with colon cancer
more likely to receive postoperative systemic chemotherapy and,
as a result, have better survival than older persons?
Findings This cohort study found that although young and
middle-aged patients were 2 to 8 times more likely to receive
postoperative systemic chemotherapy for colon cancer than older
patients, there was no significant survival difference by age group.
Meaning The additional use of postoperative systemic
chemotherapy among young and middle-aged persons without
matched survival improvement suggests possible overuse of
chemotherapy among younger than older adults with colon
cancer.

graphic factors, cancer diagnosis, treatment, and vital status
from patients with cancer diagnosed and/or treated at mili-
tary treatment facilities. The Central Cancer Registry follows
the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries
guidelines and uses the International Classification of Dis-
eases for Oncology for cancer diagnosis. The MHS Data Reposi-
tory database contains administrative and medical claims data
for inpatient and outpatient services provided at both mili-
tary treatment facilities and nonmilitary treatment facilities
paid for by the DoD. It includes clinical diagnoses of all
medical conditions, which are coded using the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and diagnostic and
treatment procedures, which are coded using International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; Current Procedural
Terminology; or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding Sys-
tem codes. The data linkage project was reviewed and ap-
proved by the institutional review boards of the Walter Reed
National Military Medical Center, Defense Health Agency, and
the National Institutes of Health Office of Human Subjects Re-
search. Patient consent was waived because the study was
based on large existing data and patients could not be identi-
fied in the linked and consolidated data.
Patient Population
Linked data were queried for patients aged between 18 and 75
years with histologically confirmed primary colon adenocar-
cinoma (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology,
Third Revision, topography site codes [C180-189]) diagnosed
betweenJanuary1,1998,andDecember31,2007.Patientswith
prior primary tumors or multiple primary colon tumors were
excluded. Also excluded were patients with unknown age. Pa-
tients were categorized into 3 groups based on age at onset of
colon cancer: 18 to 49 (young), 50 to 64 (middle), and 65 to 75
(older) years. There were 3143 patients, of whom, 671 were
young, 1599 were middle-aged, and 873 were older.
Study Variables
Treatment modalities were the variables of interest, which in-
cludedsurgeryandpostoperativesystemicchemotherapy.Sur-
gical procedures included segmental colectomy, total colec-
tomy or proctocolectomy, or other/multivisceral resection
(Current Procedural Terminology codes: 44204, 44205, 44140,
44160,44207,45.7x,and45.8x).Chemotherapyregimenswere
classified as single-agent or multiagent and had to have been
reported after the patient’s surgery date. Single-agent chemo-
therapywas5-fluorouracil(HealthcareCommonProcedureCod-
ing System code J9190) (with or without leucovorin [J0640])
or capecitabine based (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding
System codes J8520 and J8521). Multiagent regimens were de-
fined as the addition of oxaliplatin (J9263), irinotecan (J9206),
or floxuridine (J9200).
Other variables used in this study included demographic
variables,tumorcharacteristics,andcomorbidities.Demograph-
ic variables included sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, and other/unknown), marital status (mar-
ried, single, other, and unknown), military sponsor branch
(Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and other), active-duty status
(yes, no, and unknown), and benefit type (TRICARE Prime,
TRICARE Non-Prime, and other/unknown) defined as the
patient’s insurance status at any point in the 3 months prior
to diagnosis or 3 months following diagnosis. Tumor charac-
teristics included tumor location, stage, and grade. Tumor
location was characterized as right (cecum, ascending colon,
and hepatic flexure, respectively), transverse, left (splenic
flexure, descending colon, and sigmoid colon, respectively),
and overlapping/unknown. Tumor stage was determined
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer28 stag-
ing recommendations and categorized as stage I, stage II,
stage III, stage IV, and unknown. Tumor grade was classified
as I (well differentiated), II (moderately differentiated), III
and IV (poorly or undifferentiated), and unknown. Comor-
bidities were categorized according to the Charlson Comor-
bidity Index.29
The primary outcome measure of the study was overall
survival of patients who received both surgery and post-
operative systemic chemotherapy compared with those who
only received surgery. Cancer-specific survival data were not
available.
Statistical Analysis
We first described demographic, tumor, treatment, and sur-
vival characteristics by age category. To compare different age
groups in receipt of chemotherapy, we used multivariable
logistic regression models adjusted for potential confound-
ers. A potential confounder was defined as a variable that
was associated with both age group and chemotherapy,
including sex, race/ethnicity, tumor location, tumor grade,
comorbidities, military branch, marital status, and active-
duty status. We then stratified multivariable logistic models
by tumor stage at diagnosis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs
were calculated.
Overall and stage-specific survival was assessed using
Kaplan-Meier plots with log-rank test statistics. Multivari-
able Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and
95% CIs to assess the effect of treatment on overall survival
of patients with colon cancer. The models were adjusted for
the same potential confounding factors as were the logistic re-
gression models. Proportional hazards assumptions were as-
sessed using parallel log-log plots and nonsignificant Schoen-
feld residuals. Variables failing proportional hazard
assumptions were included in stratified survival models. Fol-
low-up began at the date of cancer diagnosis and ended with
date of death or date of last contact. Study follow-up was cen-
sored at December 31, 2007 (the last date of available linked
data). Median length of follow-up was 3.3 years.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute Inc). All tests of significance were 2-tailed with
α levels set at .05.
Results
Table 1 shows the distributions of demographic variables and
tumor characteristics by age category. Patients aged 18 to 49
years were less likely to be male, non-Hispanic white, and have
earlier stages at diagnosis as compared with those aged 50 to

64 and 65 to 75 years. Young patients were also more likely to
be married and to be active-duty members. Young and middle-
aged patients were more likely to have TRICARE Prime and
overlapping and unknown tumor locations and less likely to
have right-sided tumors than patients aged 65 to 75 years.
Young patients had fewer comorbidities than persons aged 50
years and older.
Young patients received more postoperative chemo-
therapy(n = 465;69.3%)thanmiddle-aged(n = 849;53.1%)and
older (n = 370; 42.4%) patients. Of those patients who re-
ceived chemotherapy, young and middle-aged patients had a
higher percentage of multiagent regimen use than older pa-
tients. However, the percentages of unknown regimen type
were high, especially for the older group. Receipt of surgery
was similar across all 3 age groups (92.0%, 91.3%, and 92.1%,
for young, middle-aged, and older patients, respectively). Sur-
vival status was similar for young and middle-aged patients
(72.0% and 71.6% alive, respectively) and lower for older pa-
tients (61.4% alive).
After adjusting for the potential confounders, young pa-
tients were more likely to receive postoperative systemic che-
motherapy as compared with older patients across all tumor
stages (Table 2). The ORs were 7.98 (95% CI, 2.88-22.11), 4.22
(95% CI, 2.23-7.98), 2.30 (95% CI, 1.01-5.22), and 2.43 (95% CI,
1.26-4.70) for young patients compared with older patients
with tumors of stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Middle-
aged patients with stage I (OR, 5.04; 95% CI, 2.30-11.05) and
stage II (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.58-3.72) disease were more likely
to receive postoperative chemotherapy compared with older
patients.
Table 3 shows the use of multiagent regimens relative to
single-agent regimens. After adjusting for potential confound-
ers, younger and middle-aged patients were also more likely
to receive multiagent regimens (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.42-4.32
andOR,2.66;95%CI,1.70-4.18,respectively)ascomparedwith
patients aged 65 to 75 years. The Figure displays survival by
tumor stage. Survival was greatest for young patients and least
for older patients. This trend was consistent across all stages.

lower than 1 after adjusting for the potential confounders.
Among patients treated with surgery alone, a significantly bet-
ter survival was observed for middle-aged patients with stage
I (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.13-0.62) and stage IV (HR, 0.47; 95%
CI, 0.22-0.98) disease than their older counterparts.
Younger patients with stage III disease who received surgery
alone had better survival than older patients (HR, 0.01; 95%
CI, 0.01-0.89). Among patients who received surgery and
postoperative systemic chemotherapy, no significant differ-
ences were observed in survival between age groups. In
addition, the HR was not lower for surgery and chemo-
therapy than the HR for surgery alone, given age group and
tumor stage.
Discussion
Our study examined whether younger and middle-aged pa-
tients with colon cancer are overtreated in the MHS, an equal-
access health care system. We found that young and middle-
aged patients are nearly 2 to 8 times more likely to receive
postoperative systemic chemotherapy after surgery com-
pared with patients aged 65 to 75 years, regardless of tumor
stageatdiagnosis.Furthermore,youngandmiddle-agedadults
were 2.5 times more likely to receive multiagent chemo-
therapy regimens and most patients with information on che-
motherapy regimens underwent multiagent regimens, sug-
gesting a tendency toward more intense treatments. While
young and middle-aged adults who only underwent surgery
had better survival compared with older patients, no signifi-
cant differences in survival were seen between young/middle-
aged and older patients who received surgery plus postopera-
tive systemic chemotherapy after adjustment for the potential
confounders. The study suggests that more use of chemo-
therapy in younger patients did not result in additional sur-
vival benefits.
Using the data from an equal-access system, our findings
areconsistentwiththestudybyKneuertzetal13suggestingthat
the association between age and chemotherapy/survival is
similarwhenaccesstocareandtheopportunitytoreceivetreat-
ment are comparable among age groups. Both studies imply
the overuse of postoperative chemotherapy in younger pa-
tients.Accordingtonationalguidelines,17,18selectpatientswith
stage II disease, such as those with inadequately sampled
nodes, T4 lesions, or poorly differentiated histology, can be
considered for adjuvant chemotherapy. However, there has
been no solid evidence on the effectiveness of chemotherapy
among this subset of patients.17 Our findings, as well as those
of Kneuertz et al,13 show higher chemotherapy use as a whole
and higher use of multiagent regimens specifically among
younger patients compared with older patients for stages I and
II as well as stages III and IV. Decision making regarding che-
motherapy involves physician recommendation and patient
acceptance. Physicians are often reluctant to recommend che-
motherapy or more intensive regimens to older patients ow-
ing to higher prevalence of comorbid diseases, adverse ef-
fects of the treatment, and chronological age itself.31,32 These
considerations are less likely to be concerns for younger pa-
tients and, thus, physicians may be more likely to recom-
mend chemotherapy. The patient’s decision to receive che-
motherapy may also be affected by financial and geographic
barriers to care and involvement in the decision-making
process,31,33 which may vary by age. A study on colorectal can-
cer chemotherapy, which had a small number of patients and
noadjustmentforpotentialconfounders,showedthatyounger
patientspreferredmoreinformationaboutthediseaseandche-
motherapy and wanted to be more involved in treatment
decisions.33
A higher use of adjuvant chemotherapy among younger
patients was demonstrated in our study, as well as in the
study by Kneuertz et al.13 Unfortunately, while younger
patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy, their sur-
vival was not correspondingly improved with this addition,

Patients with cancer who receive chemotherapy are vulner-
able to its toxicity and adverse effects and may have reduced
quality of life. As a result, patients may undergo decreased
physical,34,35 functional,34,36,37 emotional,34,35 and social35,37
well-being, although these changes might be mitigated over
time.34,35,38 In addition to the effects on patients’ quality of
life, overuse of chemotherapy increases economic burdens
on society because the cost of chemotherapy for colon cancer
is high.39 Therefore, appropriate use of chemotherapy in
colon cancer treatment should be investigated and evaluated
in further research.
Limitations
Our study had some limitations. First, some DoD beneficia-
ries might have non-DoD health insurance, and treatment
information might not be complete for these patients
because these health care services are not paid for by the
DoD and thus not included in our data. Patients aged 65 to
75 years are likely also covered by Medicare. As we did not
have access to Medicare data, it is possible that there are
missing treatment data for Medicare recipients. However, as
shown in Table 1, the older group had a similar percentage
of surgery compared with the younger groups, suggesting
that the effect of missing data might be limited. Second,
there was a higher proportion of unknown regimens for the
older group than the younger groups. We do not exclude the
possible effect of such missing information, which was dif-
ferential among age groups, on the receipt of single-agent vs
multiagent regimens. Third, sample sizes were small for
some stratified analyses. Owing to the limited number of
deaths and small sample of younger patients with surgery
alone, an HR was not able to be calculated for stage I.
Finally, because all-cause death rather than disease-specific
death was the outcome of the study, it is possible that some
deaths are not attributable to colon cancer. Nevertheless,
we adjusted for comorbidities in our analysis.

Conclusions
In an equal-access health care system, we found potential
overtreatment of young and middle-aged adults with colon
cancer. While younger patients who underwent surgery
tended to have better survival than older patients, the addi-
tion of postoperative systemic chemotherapy did not result
in matched survival improvement. Most of the young
patients received postoperative systemic chemotherapy,
including multiagent regimens, which are currently not
recommended for most patients with early-stage colon can-
cer. Our findings suggest overtreatment of young and
middle-aged adults with colon cancer.
