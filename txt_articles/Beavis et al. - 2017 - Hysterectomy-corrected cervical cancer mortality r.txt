 Hysterectomy-Corrected Cervical Cancer Mortality Rates
Reveal a Larger Racial Disparity in the United States

BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to determine the age-standardized and age-specific annual US cervical cancer mor-
tality rates after correction for the prevalence of hysterectomy and to evaluate disparities by age and race. METHODS: Estimates for
deaths due to cervical cancer stratified by age, state, year, and race were derived from the National Center for Health Statistics coun-
ty mortality data (2000-2012). Equivalently stratified data on the prevalence of hysterectomy for women 20 years old or older from
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey were used to remove women who were not at risk from the denominator. Age-
specific and age-standardized mortality rates were computed, and trends in mortality rates were analyzed with Joinpoint regression.
RESULTS: Age-standardized rates were higher for both races after correction. For black women, the corrected mortality rate was 10.1
per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6-10.6), whereas the uncorrected rate was 5.7 per 100,000 (95% CI, 5.5-6.0). The cor-
rected rate for white women was 4.7 per 100,000 (95% CI, 4.6-4.8), whereas the uncorrected rate was 3.2 per 100,000 (95% CI, 3.1-
3.2). Without the correction, the disparity in mortality between races was underestimated by 44%. Black women who were 85 years
old or older had the highest corrected rate: 37.2 deaths per 100,000. A trend analysis of corrected rates demonstrated that white
women’s rates decreased at 0.8% per year, whereas the annual decrease for black women was 3.6% (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: A cor-
rection for hysterectomy has revealed that cervical cancer mortality rates are underestimated, particularly in black women. The high-
est rates are seen in the oldest black women, and public health efforts should focus on appropriate screening and adequate
treatment in this population. Cancer 2017;123:1044-50. V

INTRODUCTION
Each year in the United States, more than 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer, and more than 4,000 women
die of it.1 Racial minorities, particularly black women, have significantly higher incidence and mortality rates for this dis-
ease.2-7 Prior studies have shown that a failure to account for the prevalence of hysterectomy has resulted in an underesti-
mation of cervical cancer incidence rates because women who have had their cervix surgically removed are inappropriately
retained in the population-at-risk denominator.2,3,8 This underestimation has the most profound effect in black women
because they have the highest prevalence of hysterectomy: age specific cervical cancer incidence rates in black women in-
crease by as much as 125% after correction, whereas there is an 83% increase in white women of the same age.2 As such,
the uncorrected race-specific incidence rates represent an underestimation of the true racial disparity.2
Recent data suggest that the mortality gap between black and white women is closing because of a decline in cervical
cancer mortality rates among black women.9 However, the effect of correction for hysterectomy prevalence on US cervical
cancer mortality rates and trends has not been evaluated. Therefore, we sought to estimate the hysterectomy-corrected US
annual age-specific and age-standardized cervical cancer mortality rates over the last decade to demonstrate the true mag-
nitude of the racial disparity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To estimate hysterectomy-corrected cervical cancer mortality rates, we first estimated the age-, race-, year-, and state-
stratified hysterectomy prevalence from national survey data, and we then used those estimates to correct the denominator

 of equivalently stratified cervical cancer mortality rate
estimates.10,11 Direct standardization with the US 2000
standard population was performed to estimate age-
standardized rates.12 The institutional review board
deemed the study exempt from review as only publicly
available de-identified information was used.
Data Sources and Database Linkage
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS)
Survey-weighted hysterectomy prevalence estimates were
obtained from the BRFSS survey, a nationally representa-
tive random-digit dialing survey of health behaviors that
reaches more than 400,000 persons in the United States
annually.10 These results were stratified by age (�20 years
in 5-year age categories), race (black, white, or other with-
out regard for Hispanic ethnicity), state, and year (2000-
2012). Data were available for hysterectomy prevalence
only during even-numbered years; therefore, stratified
hysterectomy prevalence estimates were imputed for the
odd-numbered years by the calculation of a weighted aver-
age of the flanking even-numbered years. A similar ap-
proach was used in the case of other missing data; for
example, in Hawaii, no hysterectomy data were collected
in 2004, so a weighted average was used from the flanking
years.
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) and National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS)
The SEER mortality database was used to obtain estimates
of cervical cancer mortality rates, including case counts
and population-at-risk denominators, stratified in the
same manner as the hysterectomy prevalence.11 This data-
base obtains its data from death certificate information
provided by the NCHS and combines these data with
data from the SEER incidence registries. However, be-
cause of the suppression of data for any rate based on few-
er than 10 cases produced by SEER*Stat software, we
obtained permission from the NCHS to access the exact
annual case counts, stratified by age, race, year, and state,
for deaths coded as “malignant neoplasm of the cervix ute-
ri.”13 The SEER mortality database was queried to deter-
mine

estimates

Statistical Methods
The estimates for hysterectomy prevalence from the
BRFSS, the case counts of death due to cervical cancer (n)
from the NCHS, and the population-at-risk denominator
(p) from SEER were merged into 1 database with stratifi-
cation by age category, race, state, and year. The
hysterectomy-corrected population-at-risk denominator
(pc) was then calculated with the following equation:
pc5p3
1 –h
ð
Þ
where h is the hysterectomy prevalence.
Age-standardized annual mortality rates were calcu-
lated with direct standardization with weights from US
Census 2000 population estimates for women � 20 years
old.12 Standard errors for the age-standardized mortality
rates were calculated with standard methods published by
the National Vital Statistics System of the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention.14 Mortality rate ratios and
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calcu-
lated with methods published by the International Agency
for Research on Cancer for the comparison of age-
standardized rates.15 Because the heterogeneity of the
other-race category made it difficult to draw meaningful
conclusions about the implications of the results, we pre-
sent only the overall, black, and white racial category
results. The results from the other-race category can be
found in the online Supporting Information in Figure 1,
Table 1, and Table 2.
Overall and race-stratified age-specific mortality
rates were calculated with the following formula:
MRc5n=pc3 100; 000
where MRc is the mortality rate corrected for the hysterec-
tomy prevalence. Ninety-five percent CIs were calculated
with Bernoulli’s equation:

Data linkage and management were performed with Excel

Trends in hysterectomy prevalence and cervical cancer
mortality rates over time and across age groups were evaluat-
ed with the National Cancer Institute’s Joinpoint regression
software (version 4.2.0), which uses log-linear regression to
fit the simplest trend of the data and calculate percentage
changes and to perform pairwise comparisons of trends.16
The Bayesian information criterion method for selecting
the best model was chosen because it finds the model with
the best fit by penalizing for the cost of extra parameters.17

 RESULTS
Hysterectomy Estimates
Overall, the prevalence of hysterectomy was 20% (95%
CI, 20%-21%) for women � 20 years old (see Support-
ing Information Table 1) and was higher for black wom-
en than white women (23% vs 21%, P < 0.05). The age-
specific hysterectomy prevalence was also higher for black
women than white women for all ages between 45 and 69
years (P < .05). The hysterectomy prevalence peaked at
the same age for white and black women (65-69 years),
but the peak was higher for black women (58% vs 43%
for white women, P < .05; Fig. 1). Despite minor
changes in prevalence from 2000 to 2012, there were no
significant trends across time.
Age-Standardized Cervical Cancer Mortality
Rates
Correction for hysterectomy resulted in significantly
higher rates of cervical cancer mortality. The uncorrected
age-standardized cervical cancer mortality rate for all races
combined from 2000 to 2012 was 3.4 deaths per 100,000
women (95% CI, 3.3-3.4), whereas the corrected rate was
5.0 deaths per 100,000 women (95% CI, 4.9-5.1; data not
shown). The corrected age-standardized rate for black wom-
en was 10.1 per 100,000 (95% CI, 9.6-10.6), whereas the
uncorrected rate was 5.7 per 100,000 (95% CI, 5.5-6.0; Ta-
ble 1). For white women, the corrected age-standardized
rate was 4.7 per 100,000 (95% CI, 4.6-4.8), whereas the
uncorrected rate was 3.2 per 100,000 (95% CI, 3.1-3.2).
The uncorrected mortality rate ratio for black women versus
white women was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7-1.9), and the ratio in-
creased to 2.2 (95% CI, 2.0-2.3) after correction.
A trend analysis of changes in age-standardized rates
over time demonstrated similar patterns for uncorrected
and corrected rates in white women: there was a nonsig-
nificant (NS) decrease from 2000 to 2002 (uncorrected
annual percentage change [APC], 26.05% [P 5 NS];
corrected APC, 27.45% [P 5 NS]), and there was a
slower rate of decline from 2002 to 2012 that was signifi-
cant only in the corrected rates (uncorrected APC,
20.42% [P 5 NS]; corrected APC, 20.76% [P < .05];
Fig. 2A). In black women, uncorrected and corrected
rates also showed a similar pattern, with a significant de-
cline demonstrated over the entire decade (uncorrected
APC, 22.24% [P < .05]; corrected APC, 23.57%
[P < .05]); the corrected APC was significantly greater

black women was greater than the corrected APC trend
in white women (23.57% vs 20.76%, P for the pairwise
comparison < .05).
Age-Specific Cervical Cancer Mortality Rates
Age-specific cervical cancer mortality rates increased with
age for all races, and corrected and uncorrected rates did
not plateau at any point (Fig. 3A,B). Both corrected and
uncorrected age-specific cervical cancer mortality rates
were significantly higher for black women than white
women in all age categories except 20 to 29 and 35 to 39
years. Corrected rates were highest for black women who
were 85 years and older: before correction, the rate was
18.6 per 100,000 (95% CI, 15.4-21.7), and after correc-
tion, it was 37.2 per 100,000 (95% CI, 31.0-43.5). This
demonstrates 101% increase (Table 2). The highest per-
centage increase was seen in black women aged 65 to 69
years, for whom rates increased by more than 126%. The
percentage increase for white women of the same age was
75%.
DISCUSSION
National cervical cancer mortality rates have previously
been reported without consideration of the proportion of
women who are no longer at risk for cervical cancer by vir-
tue of having had their cervix removed during a complete
hysterectomy; this has resulted in an underestimation of
the overall mortality rate and the race-specific disparity.
Using a large, nationally representative sample to estimate
the hysterectomy prevalence, we have demonstrated that
age-standardized and age-specific cervical cancer mortality
rates are significantly higher in all races after correction
for the hysterectomy prevalence. The effect of hysterecto-
my correction is most notable for black women, in whom
the corrected age-standardized mortality rates are more
than double those seen in white women. In fact, this study
demonstrates that the racial disparity is underestimated by
44% if the correction is not performed. In addition, the
disparity between black and white women starts at an ear-
ly age and increases with age, so the oldest black women
are the most at risk to die of this disease. However, a trend
analysis of the corrected cervical cancer mortality rate does
suggest that the mortality gap may in fact be closing be-
cause black women have a larger annual percentage de-
crease in mortality in comparison with white women after
correction.
Comparing the corrected age-standardized morality
rates of black and white women living in the United
States with the global mortality rates of women helps to
put the significance of the racial disparity into perspec-
tive. The corrected overall mortality rate for white women
of 3.4 per 100,000 is equivalent to the 2012 GLOBO-
CAN estimate of the cervical cancer mortality rate for
women living in developed nations (ie, Europe, Northern
America, Australia/New Zealand, and Japan) of 3.3 per
100,000. However, the corrected estimate for black wom-
en living in the United States of 10.1 per 100,000 is on
par with the GLOBOCAN estimate of 9.8 per 100,000
for less developed nations (ie, all of Africa, Asia [exclud-
ing Japan], Latin America, and the Caribbean). In fact,
the corrected mortality rates for black women in the

 current study are as high as those seen in sub-Saharan
Africa.18 The current study adds to the body of literature
supporting the periodic recalculation of national cervical
cancer incidence and mortality rates to better understand
the true racial disparity and changes over time.2,3,8 These
data should also be taken into consideration when one is
calibrating mathematical models of the natural history of
cervical cancer.
The current study complements previously reported
hysterectomy-corrected age-specific cervical cancer inci-
dence rates, which were calculated with the same data
sources and methodology. Incidence rates for black
women were disproportionately increased by correction
for hysterectomy in comparison with white women. The
highest corrected incidence rates were also found in the
oldest black women.2 Together, these analyses of inci-
dence and mortality provide a complete and contempo-
rary picture of cervical cancer in at-risk women in the
United States. Similar analyses have demonstrated in-
creased uterine cancer incidence rates after correction for
the prevalence of hysterectomy, and they suggest that the
correction for hysterectomy is necessary when one is
reporting racial disparities in US cancer rates.19 The dis-
parity in cervical cancer incidence has been hypothesized

 to be related to a lack of access to screening; however, sev-
eral studies have demonstrated equivalent screening rates
in black and white women.20,21 A differential loss to
follow-up after abnormal Papanicolaou test results and
differences in tumor biology may also contribute to the
disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality.22-24
There are likely additional factors that contribute
specifically to the mortality disparity noted in the current
study. A differential distribution of histologic subtypes by
age and race may explain some of the difference in mortal-
ity: rates of adenocarcinoma in black women increase
with increasing age, whereas they plateau at the age of 35
years in white women, and adenocarcinoma has a higher
rate of death from disease in comparison with squamous
cell carcinoma in both early- and late-stage cervical can-
cer.25,26 Differences in treatment likely also play a role:
black women are more likely to present at a later stage of
diagnosis and may receive different treatment after diag-
nosis in comparison with white women.27-29 An evalua-
tion of Maryland Cancer Registry data found that black
women had 50% lower odds of undergoing surgery and
50% higher odds of receiving radiation in comparison
with white women with the same stage and insurance.30
In addition, in an evaluation of SEER data, an age greater
than 70 years and black race were both independently as-
sociated with a lower likelihood of receiving complete sur-
gical staging and appropriate adjuvant radiation (if the
primary treatment was surgery) and with a lower likeli-
hood of receiving complete curative-intent radiation (if
the primary treatment was radiation).31 This is concor-
dant with the current study’s finding that the oldest black
women have the highest cervical cancer mortality rates
and supports research to gain an understanding of why
this unique population receives differential treatment for
the same disease.
There are several considerations when the BRFSS is
being used to estimate the prevalence of hysterectomy.
First, the estimate of the hysterectomy prevalence is based
on self-reporting. Although prior studies have demon-
strated self-reporting as a valid method of assessing a
woman’s hysterectomy status,32,33 the BRFSS does not
distinguish between a complete hysterectomy (ie, removal
of the uterus and cervix) and a supracervical hysterectomy
(in which the cervix is left in situ). This would likely mini-
mally overestimate the corrected mortality rates because
several studies before 2004 estimated the prevalence of
supracervical hysterectomy at <2%, whereas recent data
suggest that the prevalence is 4% to 7.5%.3,34,35 Second,
the methodology of BRFSS data collection changed in the
2011 and 2012 data sets: cellphone-only household data
were included, and a more robust weighting method (or
raking) was applied. This may have resulted in higher
state-level hysterectomy prevalence estimates than those
in 2002-2010, but the hysterectomy prevalence estimates
may also be more accurate for minority populations be-
cause of the increased reach of the survey in the latter
years.36 However, Joinpoint regression failed to show sig-
nificant trends in hysterectomy prevalence by race from
2002 to 2012, so the overall trends are likely still accurate.
In addition, the current study provides estimates
from the states represented in SEER-18 (excluding Louisi-
ana) and does not include data from all 50 states. Howev-
er, a major strength of the study was the ability to obtain
individual-level data for these states to provide the most
accurate composite estimates. As emphasized in Temkin
et al,19 the hysterectomy prevalence differs by time, age,
race, and geographic location; our estimates were stratified
by these factors to minimize errors in our mortality esti-
mates. In contrast, solely using registry data or using less
well-stratified data would have likely resulted in inaccu-
rate rates. Another important consideration is that an
analysis by histologic subtype could not be performed be-
cause these data were not available in the NCHS mortality
database.
In conclusion, our study illustrates the impact of
correction for hysterectomy prevalence on cervical cancer
mortality rates in black and white women in the United
States. This correction reveals a larger racial disparity,
with the most profound effect seen in the rates of the old-
est black women.2 Given that both older age and black
race have been shown to be independent predictors of in-
adequate treatment after diagnosis, clinicians must be
aware of the disparity to help to ensure equal treatment in
the future.31 Although corrected rates demonstrate a de-
cline in mortality rates in black women over time, overall,
the rate of death is still twice that for white women; this is
a public health disparity that cannot be ignored. Future
research should focus on overcoming the underlying fac-
tors that contribute to this mortality gap (differential
follow-up for abnormal Papanicolaou test results and bar-
riers to care after diagnosis) and on determining why black
women and older women receive different and inadequate
treatment for the same disease.
