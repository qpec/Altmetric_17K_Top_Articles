ABSTRACT 
 
Background: 
Depression 
and 
anxiety 
disorders 
are 
relapse-prone 
conditions, even after successful treatment with pharmacotherapy or 
psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is known to prevent 
relapse, but there is little evidence of the durability of remission after low 
intensity forms of CBT (LiCBT). 
Method: This study aimed to examine relapse rates 12 months after 
completing routinely-delivered LiCBT. A cohort of 439 LiCBT completers with 
remission of symptoms provided monthly depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety 
(GAD-7) measures during 12 months after treatment. Survival analysis was 
conducted 
to 
model 
time-to-relapse 
while 
controlling 
for 
patient 
characteristics. 
Results: Overall, 53% of cases relapsed within 1 year. Of these relapse 
events, the majority (79%) occurred within the first 6 months post-
treatment. Cases reporting residual depression symptoms (PHQ-9 = 5 to 9) 
at the end of treatment had significantly higher risk of relapse (hazard ratio 
= 1.90, p < 0.001). 
Conclusions: The high rate of relapse after LiCBT highlights the need for 
relapse prevention, particularly for those with residual depression 
symptoms.

1. Introduction 
 
Depression is known to have a high recurrence rate, even after the 
successful treatment of acute-phase symptoms (Burcusa & Iacono, 2007; 
Yiend et al., 2009; Harter et al., 2007; Hardeveld et al., 2010; Gopinath et 
al., 2007). For example, after a first episode of depression, the probability of 
a further episode is approximately 50%; this rises to 70% following two 
episodes and 90% after a third episode (Burcusa & Iacono, 2007; Kessler et 
al., 1996). It also appears that with each further episode there is an increase 
in the severity of depressive symptoms and an increased probability that 
these symptoms will become resistant to treatment (Kendler et al., 2000). 
Similarly, research on anxiety disorders suggests high recurrence rates 
between 39% and 56% after treatment (Bruce et al., 2005; Eisen et al., 1999; 
Vervliet et al., 2013). 
Literature in the field draws conceptual distinctions between relapse –
a deterioration after initial response to treatment– and recurrence –a new 
episode of the disorder following a period of recovery– (Bockting et al., 2015). 
Meta-analyses of trials in this area show that accessing cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT) reduces the risk of depression relapse (Vittengl et 
al., 
2007; 
Cuijpers 
et 
al., 
2013) 
by 
comparison 
to 
acute-phase 
pharmacological treatment. The prophylactic effects of CBT appear to be as 
durable as to those of long-term maintenance on pharmacological treatment, 
but better at preventing relapse and recurrence compared to acute-phase 
pharmacological treatment without a maintenance phase (Hollon et al., 
2005). Similarly, CBT is associated with sustained maintenance of 
improvements after the acute phase of treatment in various anxiety 
disorders (Otto, Smits, & Reese, 2005). It is, however, unclear if this 
 4 
 
apparent durability of therapeutic effects primarily applies to conventional 
CBT delivered by qualified psychotherapists or psychologists for up to 20 
sessions, as applied in efficacy trials.  
Recent decades have seen the development of briefer and ‘low 
intensity’ versions of CBT (LiCBT) which can be delivered as guided self-help 
interventions supported by didactic materials (Bennett-Levy et al., 2010). 
LiCBT is becoming a common form of psychological care in many services, 
for example it is the predominant treatment option offered to thousands of 
patients each year in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) 
programme in England (Clark, 2011). LiCBT involves brief (<8 sessions), 
highly 
structured 
(manual 
driven) 
psycho-educational 
interventions 
delivered in a variety of flexible formats (e.g., in person, via telephone, in 
groups, assisted by computerized learning modules). In the UK, for example, 
LiCBT is typically delivered by coaches (psychological wellbeing practitioners) 
who do not have formal psychotherapy or clinical psychology qualifications, 
but who are trained to a standardized curriculum and competency 
framework (e.g., see Richards & Whyte, 2009).  
Although LiCBT can be effective at alleviating symptoms of depression 
and anxiety (Gellatly et al., 2007), it is as yet unclear if these effects are 
sustained after the acute-phase of treatment. For example, Coull et al. 
(2011) carried out a meta-analysis of 13 controlled trials comparing LiCBT 
versus waitlist or usual care controls, which estimated a statistically 
significant but small mean weighted effect size of d = 0.32 favouring LiCBT 
for 9 studies that reported follow-up data (up to 12 months), and this effect 
reduced to d = 0.19 after excluding a study with low quality rating. This 
finding is closely comparable to the statistically significant between-group 
effect size (d = 0.20) reported in a meta-analyses of computerized CBT for 
 5 
 
depression that examined (up to 4 months) follow-up assessments (Richards 
& Richardson, 2012). However, this stands in contrast to a meta-analysis of 
internet-based CBT for depressive and anxiety disorders which concluded 
that clinical improvements were maintained at follow-up (median of 26 
weeks) with no evidence of relapse (Andrews et al., 2010). The mixed 
evidence about its therapeutic durability raises important questions about 
the clinical and cost-effectiveness of LiCBT interventions, particularly when 
delivered in routine care conditions. Furthermore, evidence from meta-
analyses is usually expressed in the form of effect sizes, masking 
information about the actual numbers (and proportions) of cases that may 
have relapsed in primary studies. 
This study presents the findings of a naturalistic cohort study 
investigating remission and relapse rates following the completion of LiCBT 
interventions delivered in routine clinical care. The objectives of this study 
were to quantify post-treatment relapse rates at 12 months’ follow-up and to 
explore predictors of time-to-relapse. 
  
2. Method 
 
2.1. Design and context 
This was a prospective, longitudinal cohort study that included 
patients who completed LiCBT interventions in a primary care mental health 
service linked to the English IAPT programme. LiCBT interventions offered in 
the service followed national clinical guidelines (National Institute for Health 
and Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2011); they were highly standardised and 
delivered under regular (weekly or fortnightly) clinical supervision. These 
included individual and group guided self-help, as well as computerized CBT 
 6 
 
interventions supported by psychological wellbeing practitioners. LiCBT 
interventions delivered in IAPT are based on principles of CBT, and aim to 
teach patients to apply coping skills including self-monitoring, goal setting, 
behavioural activation, graded exposure, problem solving, sleep hygiene, 
cognitive restructuring and relapse prevention (Bennett-Levy et al., 2010; 
Richards & Whyte, 2009). 
Unlike controlled trials where the duration of treatment is often fixed 
per protocol, naturalistic studies typically show wide variability in the length 
of treatment, since patients attend a sufficient number of sessions to attain 
a good enough level (GEL) of improvement and then discontinue therapy 
(Barkham et al., 2006). This study aimed to assess the durability of LiCBT 
under routine care conditions, and therefore our definition of completion 
was consistent with the GEL model: completers attended at least 1 LiCBT 
therapy session after their initial assessment and had an end of treatment 
mutually agreed with their therapist (e.g. did not unilaterally drop out). 
Consistent with this definition, patients were eligible to take part in the 
study if they met 4 criteria: (1) they had case-level depression and/or anxiety 
symptoms at assessment; (2) they attended at least 1 LiCBT session; (3) they 
had a planned end of treatment; (4) they had below-threshold depression 
and anxiety symptoms, meeting IAPT criteria for recovery (Clark et al., 2009), 
as described in section 2.3 below. Those referred for ongoing psychological 
care (i.e., stepped-up to formal psychotherapeutic interventions) were 
excluded from the study. Eligible participants were identified from treatment 
discharge records and were invited to participate within 1 month of 
treatment completion. Consenting participants were contacted once per 
month using their preferred method (post, telephone, email) and were asked 
 7 
 
to complete questionnaires (described below) to monitor symptoms of 
depression and anxiety.  
Participants remained in the study until they met one of three end-
point criteria: (1) their symptom scores were indicative of relapse as defined 
below; (2) they failed to respond to 2 consecutive monthly assessments, in 
which case they were considered lost to follow-up; or (3) their symptoms 
remained 
in 
remission 
until 
the 
12-month 
follow-up 
assessment. 
Participants classified as relapsed were contacted by the research team; they 
received information about support options and were encouraged to re-
engage with medical and/or psychological care. Service users were involved 
in the development of the study, and their views informed several aspects of 
the design (monthly frequency of assessments, end-point criteria and relapse 
support strategies) to ensure the study was feasible and acceptable. The 
study was approved by the NHS Health Research Authority and reviewed by 
an independent ethics committee (Yorkshire and Humber REC; Ref: 
12/YH/0095). 
 
2.2. Measures and data sources 
Two validated patient reported outcome measures are routinely used 
in IAPT services to monitor depression and anxiety symptoms. The PHQ-9 is 
a nine-item screening tool for major depression (Kroenke et al., 2001). Each 
item is rated on a 0 to 3 scale, yielding a total depression severity score 
between 0-27. A cut-off ≥ 10 is used to detect clinically significant 
depression symptoms (Kroenke et al., 2001) and a reliable change index of ≥ 
5 points has been recommended to monitor improvement or deterioration 
over time (McMillan et al., 2010). The GAD-7 is a seven-item measure 
developed to screen for anxiety disorders (Spitzer et al., 2006). Each item is 
 8 
 
also rated on a 0 to 3 scale, yielding a total anxiety severity score between 0-
21. A cut-off score ≥8 is recommended to identify the likely presence of a 
diagnosable anxiety disorder (Kroenke et al., 2007), with a reliable change 
index of ≥5 points (Richards & Borglin, 2011). Standard cut-off scores have 
been recommended for these measures to identify mild (≥5; residual or sub-
threshold symptoms), moderate (≥10), moderately-severe (≥15) and severe 
(≥20) symptoms (Kroenke et al., 2001, 2007). 
 
De-identified clinical assessment records were also collected for 
participants, including demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, employment, 
socioeconomic deprivation) and clinical information from the acute-phase of 
treatment (primary diagnosis, session-to-session outcome measures, family 
history of mental health problems, number of prior treatment episodes as a 
proxy for a relapsing condition). Furthermore, we created two variables using 
PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores from the treatment phase: (1) Early change scores 
were estimated by subtracting symptom scores at session 3 from baseline 
(session 1) scores. (2) We used the last treatment session scores to derive a 
binary variable denoting the presence of residual symptoms (PHQ-9 = 5 to 9; 
GAD-7 = 5 to 7).  Functional impairment was assessed using the Work and 
Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; Mundt et al., 2002). The WSAS measures 
the extent to which mental health problems impair daily functioning across 
5 domains (work, home chores, social leisure, private leisure, and 
relationships). Responses are captured using 5 items rated on a nine-point 
scale ranging from “not at all” to “severely impaired”. Socioeconomic 
deprivation was assessed by matching participants’ home postcodes to the 
English 
Index 
of Multiple 
Deprivation 
2010 
(IMD; 
Department 
for 
Communities and Local Government, 2011), and categorising cases into 
quintile levels of deprivation. The IMD is an area-level composite measure 
 9 
 
which assigns a deprivation score to post code areas across England, taking 
into consideration 7 areas: income, employment, education level, health, 
crime, quality of housing and living environment. 
 
2.3. Outcome definitions 
Patients included in the study started treatment with case-level 
depression and/or anxiety symptoms and completed treatment with PHQ-9 
and GAD-7 scores below the established diagnostic cut-offs; and thus met 
criteria for recovery as currently applied in IAPT services (NICE, 2011). To be 
classed as a relapse event, post-treatment symptom scores for at least one of 
the outcome measures were (1) above the diagnostic cut-off and were (2) ≥5 
points greater than the symptom scores at the time of the last attended 
treatment session. This operational definition is consistent with Jacobson 
and Truax (1991) criteria for reliable and clinically significant deterioration. 
Participants who did not meet these criteria were classed as in remission. 
Thus, our primary outcome of interest was binary and coded as 0 = in 
remission and 1 = relapsed. 
 
2.4. Statistical analyses 
The recruitment process for the study was summarised following the 
STROBE guidelines (Von Elm et al., 2007) for observational cohort studies. 
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the included sample were 
compared to the wider pool of potentially eligible participants that were 
approached but who did not consent to take part in the study. These 
comparisons were based on Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables 
and chi-square tests for categorical variables.

We used survival analysis to assess the durability of LiCBT treatment 
effects over 12 months following treatment completion, and to determine 
predictors of relapse. Observed (unadjusted) time-to-relapse (in months) was 
assessed using non-parametric Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves (Kaplan & Meier, 
1958). KM curves plot the probability of survival (remission) over time, while 
taking account of censored (i.e., missing) data points (N = 154 in this study). 
Hazard ratios predicting time-to-relapse were estimated with a semi-
parametric Cox proportional hazards model (Cox, 1992). Cox regression does 
not make any assumptions about the shape of the underlying hazard 
function; however, it assumes that the hazard functions are proportional 
over time (i.e., there is a constant relative hazard). Based on this 
assumption, the estimated hazard ratio is multiplicatively related to the 
underlying hazard. We evaluated the proportional hazards assumption using 
a log-log plot [a plot of log(-log(survival) vs log(time)] and by fitting a smooth 
function of model residuals (Schoenfeld residuals) over time. Rejection of the 
null hypothesis implies deviation from the proportional hazards assumption. 
Additionally, 
we 
conducted 
parametric 
survival 
analysis 
using 
an 
exponential distribution. We also compared the results using the Weibull 
distribution which provided similar model estimates; hence, the exponential 
parametric results are reported. 
For variable selection, we followed the approach discussed by Machin 
et al. (2006). First, the residual scores for the primary variables of interest 
(PHQ-9 and GAD-7) at the time of treatment completion were included in the 
model. Next, other potential variables of interest were entered in the model, 
including those that were statistically significant in univariate Cox 
regressions. These variables were age, gender, employment status, 
deprivation level (as measured by the IMD variable), number of prior 
 11 
 
treatment 
episodes, 
early 
change 
scores 
and 
residual 
symptoms 
classification for PHQ-9 and GAD-7. The final model only included variables 
that were either statistically significant based on an alpha of p ≤ .10, or were 
hypothesised a priori as potential prognostic factors irrespective of statistical 
significance (i.e., residual symptoms). Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis 
was conducted entering excluded variables. 
The overall model fit was assessed using Cox-Snell residuals. If the 
model offers a good fit to the data, then the true cumulative hazard function 
(conditional on covariates) should have an exponential distribution with a 
hazard rate of 1 (Cleves et al., 2008). We also applied a specification link test 
which refits the model using the predicted value and its squared term to 
evaluate misspecification error (which would be confirmed by a statistically 
significant error term). The predictive value of the regression model was 
assessed using Harrell’s C, which is the proportion of all usable subject pairs 
where the prediction and outcome are concordant (Harrell et al., 1982). A 
higher value of Harrell’s C is desirable. 
A series of sensitivity analyses were also conducted. First, we included 
the following variables which were initially excluded from the main analysis: 
baseline severity, change scores for the early phase of treatment, number of 
LiCBT treatment sessions, family history of mental health problems, and 
employment status. Secondly, we used parametric survival regression to 
evaluate the impact on regression coefficients. We also graphically evaluated 
how these distributions fit the observed data. Finally, we evaluated the 
impact of removing any outlier observations (identified using a deviance 
residual plot) on model estimates. All analyses were conducted in Stata 
v13.1.

3. Results 
 
3.1. Sample characteristics 
A total of 439 consenting participants were included in the follow-up 
phase of the study, out of a pool of 2,100 potentially eligible patients who 
were identified from treatment discharge records (STROBE diagram available 
in supplementary appendix 1). 
 
The mean age in the sample was 41.28 (SD = 14.59; range = 17 to 82); 
59.7% were females; 94.2% were from a White British background; and 
33.7% were unemployed. Approximately 54.8% reported having a family 
history of mental health problems. The most common primary presenting 
problems recorded in clinical assessments were mixed anxiety and 
depression (31.9%), depressive episode (24.8%), generalised anxiety disorder 
(19.3%), panic disorder (4.7%) and recurrent depression (2%). Other 
conditions (i.e. agoraphobia, specific phobia, health anxiety) were much less 
common, and approximately 13.1% of presenting problems were unspecified. 
The mean number of prior treatment episodes was 1.02 (SD = 1.60; range 0 
to 21; 42.3% had no prior treatment episodes). 
 
The mean number of acute-phase treatment contacts including initial 
assessment was 7.04 (SD = 1.99; mode = 7; range = 2 to 16). Mean baseline 
severity measures at the time of initial assessments were PHQ-9 = 13.60 (SD 
= 5.41); GAD-7 = 13.20 (SD = 4.38). Mean scores at the last acute-phase 
treatment contacts were PHQ-9 = 3.44 (SD = 2.40); GAD-7 = 3.19 (SD = 
2.17). At the end of treatment, 31.4% of cases had residual depression 
symptoms (PHQ-9 = 5 to 9) and 29.6% had residual anxiety symptoms 
(GAD-7 = 5 to 7). 
 13 
 
 
The sample of study participants and the wider pool of potentially 
eligible participants were comparable in all demographic and clinical 
characteristics except for four variables. The study participants had a higher 
mean age (U[1,823] = 345,288.00, p = 0.001), a higher mean number of prior 
treatments (U[1,289] = 159,569.00, p < 0.02), a lower mean PHQ-9 score at 
the final treatment session (U[1,823] = 281,739.50, p = 0.03), and a higher 
mean number of treatment sessions (U[1,823] = 354,203.00, p < 0.001). 
 
[Figure 1] 
 
3.2. Time-to-event analysis 
Overall, and after accounting for censored data points, 52.8% of cases 
were classified as relapse events within the 12-month follow-up period 
(47.2% remained in remission at 12 months). Figure 1 (Panel A) displays KM 
survival estimates, where the curve denotes the proportion of cases 
remaining in remission at each monthly measurement point (with actual 
numbers displayed in the table underneath). The majority of relapse events 
occurred within the first 6 months (i.e., of those who relapsed, 49% did so by 
month 2; 70% by month 4; 79% by month 6) and the rate of relapse 
decelerates thereafter. Panel B displays a smoothed estimated hazard 
function (with 95% confidence intervals), showing the risk of relapse over 
time.

3.3. Predicting relapse 
Table 1 shows univariate hazard ratios for variables tested as 
potential predictors of time-to-relapse. The only statistically significant 
predictors were final treatment session PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores, as well as 
the presence of residual symptoms in these measures (all p < 0.001). Tables 
2 and 3 show the results of the Cox proportional hazards model and the 
parametric regression model predicting time-to-relapse using multiple 
variables that were endorsed in the preliminary univariate analyses. Both 
models show that participants with residual depression symptoms (PHQ-9 = 
5 to 9; but not residual GAD-7 symptoms) at the last treatment session were 
approximately twice as likely (hazard ratios = 1.9) to relapse compared to 
those with minimal symptoms (PHQ-9 ≤ 4); p < 0.001. All sensitivity analyses 
yielded the same results and no additional variables predicted time-to-
relapse (baseline severity, early response to treatment, number of LiCBT 
treatment 
contacts, 
family 
history 
of 
mental 
health 
problems, 
unemployment; all p > 0.05). 
 
 
[Figure 2] 
 
 
Figure 2 shows adjusted survival functions based on Cox regression 
(panel A) and parametric regression models (panel B). Participants who 
finished treatment with residual depression symptoms were at greater risk of 
relapse (approximately 80% probability) and tended to have a shorter 
duration of remission compared to those with minimal symptoms.

4. Discussion 
 
4.1. Main findings 
To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the durability of 
treatment effects for low intensity psychological interventions delivered in 
routine stepped care practice. The main findings can be summarised in 3 
points. (1) One in two patients who attained remission of symptoms after 
acute-phase treatment experienced a clinically significant deterioration 
within 12 months of completing treatment. (2) Around eight out of ten 
relapse events occurred within the first 6 months post-treatment. (3) 
Patients who reported residual depression symptoms at the end of treatment 
were at higher risk of relapse (80% probability) and tended to deteriorate 
sooner. Residual anxiety symptoms were not found to be predictive of 
relapse after controlling for residual depression. These observations about 
the effectiveness of LiCBT beyond the acute-phase of treatment are 
particularly sobering when we consider that all our study participants had 
an agreed end of treatment, with sub-clinical symptoms. Previous studies 
have demonstrated that the length of treatment and the presence of early 
symptomatic gains are predictive of remission of acute-phase symptoms in 
LiCBT (e.g., see Delgadillo et al., 2014), but no such association was evident 
with longer-term outcomes. 
 
4.2. Strengths and limitations 
Much of what is known about relapse after psychological care is 
derived from controlled trials, with samples typically under 100 patients 
(Vittengl et al., 2007). In contrast, this was a large (N > 400) and adequately 
powered prospective cohort study which included a sample of patients 
 16 
 
accessing the variety of LiCBT interventions typically offered in IAPT services 
(Clark, 2011; Richards & Borglin, 2011). Compared to most clinical trials of 
psychological interventions, which undertake post-treatment follow-up at 6 
or 12 months (Coull & Morris, 2011), the study design enabled us to 
undertake a month-by-month quantification of remission and relapse rates. 
This approach provided information on time-to-relapse and enabled us to 
learn that around 70% of relapse events are detected within the first 4 
months following treatment. 
 
There are some methodological issues to consider when interpreting 
these findings. We did not undertake structured diagnostic interviews to 
determine if participants met criteria for a common mental disorder. This is 
an important limitation, since it is possible that some cases that we 
classified as having relapsed may not meet full diagnostic criteria. The PHQ-
9 and GAD-7 are well established case-finding tools for mental health 
problems, with upward of 80% sensitivity and specificity in primary care 
populations (Spitzer et al., 2006; Kroenke et al., 2007). Although it is 
possible that a small number of ‘false positives’ may have been classed as 
relapse events due to our reliance on self-reported PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores, 
we applied a reliable change index to detect cases with a clinically significant 
increase in symptoms that is less likely to be explained by measurement 
error or chance (Jacobson & Truax, 1991). Adopting this conservative and 
pragmatic approach, we were able to apply a robust way to detect clinically 
important deterioration in a way that was intensive (monthly contacts), 
flexible (via post, telephone, email) and acceptable to study participants. 
Diagnostic interviews are seldom applied in routine practice, and thus we 
argue that our method offers a proof of principle that monthly post-treatment 
follow-up is feasible to embed into a routine clinical system, albeit with 
 17 
 
expected loss to follow-up as is common in observational studies. Another 
limitation is that the study recruited participants from a single service. 
Furthermore, the study participants differed from the wider pool of 
potentially eligible treatment completers in some characteristics, which 
meant they tended to have longer treatments and marginally better 
depression outcomes than those in the reference sample. This is an 
important observation that suggests that our estimation of relapse rates may 
be more conservative than the rates that could be expected in the wider 
population of LiCBT completers (who tend to have higher levels of residual 
depression symptoms). Although future replication in other locations is 
advisable, we note that our findings are consistent with results from meta-
analyses of controlled trials that assessed the longer-term durability of 
LiCBT treatment effects (Coull & Morris, 2011; Richards & Richardson, 
2012). 
 
As expected, some participants in our study were lost to follow-up. 
Survival analysis assumes non-informative censoring, which implies that the 
pattern of missing data is unrelated to the outcome of interest. Hence, 
survival analysis uses all available data (including that from participants 
who were later lost to follow-up) by partitioning the follow-up period into 
sub-intervals (i.e., months) at which events (i.e., relapse) or censoring occur. 
Subsequently, all available data within each interval is included in the 
analysis. It is of course possible that some cases were lost to follow-up due 
to relapse, and therefore our estimates of relapse are likely to be 
conservative.

4.3. Considerations for policy and practice 
Over a decade ago, Tylee and Jones (2005) recognised how the rule of 
halves applies in depression treatment: “only half of depressed patients seek 
help from doctors, half are detected in primary care, half receive treatment 
with only half completing it”. This aphorism seems to apply in low intensity 
psychological care as much as in pharmacological treatment. Richards and 
Borglin (2011), for example, observed that around a quarter of patients 
screened as suitable for IAPT treatment failed to attend their initial therapy 
appointment and another quarter dropped out after starting therapy. Less 
than half of those who start LiCBT attain reliable and clinically significant 
improvement (Delgadillo et al., 2014; Green et al., 2014; Firth et al., 2015). 
Furthermore, approximately half of treatment completers classed as 
recovered are likely to relapse within a year of discharge from care. Overall, 
taking an optimistic assumption that up to 43% of those who access LiCBT 
attain reliable and clinically significant improvement (Delgadillo et al., 2014), 
only 20% of all LiCBT cases are likely to remain in remission 12 months 
after treatment. 
 
It seems hasty to consider patients ‘recovered’ at the point of 
discharge without assessing full remission of symptoms over a longer period. 
The wider literature in this area suggests that recovery can only be 
considered following an extended period (i.e., 6 to 12 months) of full 
remission of symptoms (Bockting et al., 2015). Current mental health policy 
in the UK emphasises the notion of recovery (Department of Health, 2014), 
reinforcing a short-term view about common mental health problems in 
primary care. Our findings align with the extant literature (Burcusa & 
Iacono, 2007; Yiend et al., 2009; Harter et al., 2007; Hardeveld et al., 2010; 
Gopinath et al., 2007) and suggest taking the long view, recognising that 
 19 
 
problems like depression often have to be managed like recurrent long-term 
conditions.  
In this regard, we would recommend two areas for future practice 
developments. First, the influence of residual depression symptoms on the 
risk of relapse is well documented (Vittengl et al., 2007; Paykel et al., 1995), 
and it is known that around 76% of such cases relapse within 10 months of 
treatment completion (Paykel, 2008). Our results show a very similar pattern 
for this high risk group. Patients accessing LiCBT who have shown initial 
response to treatment should ideally continue to access care until attaining 
a full remission of symptoms (scores < 5 on PHQ-9, GAD-7). It could be 
argued that many (31%) of the relapse cases in this study actually had a 
partial (rather than full) remission at the time of treatment completion, and 
thus never actually ‘recovered’. Second, patients should have access to 
active and responsive follow-up by a dedicated case manager (Von Korff & 
Goldberg, 2001). Post-treatment follow-up appointments could be offered as 
less frequent booster sessions (Gearing et al., 2013) or less intensive self-
management support, particularly during the critical period of 4 to 6 months 
after acute-phase treatment. More broadly, there are a number of evidence-
based relapse prevention options that could form part of the landscape of 
primary care interventions. For example, continuation-phase CBT has been 
shown to reduce the risk of relapse by up to 29% at 12 months’ follow-up 
compared to assessment only (Vittengl et al., 2007). Mindfulness based 
interventions have also been associated with a relapse risk reduction of up 
to 43% for patients with 3 to 4 previous episodes of depression (Piet & 
Hougaard, 2011). It is clear that relapse prevention is an overlooked aspect 
of routine stepped care practice in IAPT services and an important area for 
further policy and research developments.
