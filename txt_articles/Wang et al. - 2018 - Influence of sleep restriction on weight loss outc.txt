Abstract
Study Objectives: To examine the effects of moderate sleep restriction (SR) on body weight, body composition, and 
metabolic variables in individuals undergoing caloric restriction (CR).
Methods: Overweight or obese adults were randomized to an 8 week caloric restriction (CR) regimen alone (n = 15) or 
combined with sleep restriction (CR + SR) (n = 21). All participants were instructed to restrict daily calorie intake to 95 per 
cent of their measured resting metabolic rate. Participants in the CR + SR group were also instructed to reduce time in bed 
on five nights and to sleep ad libitum on the other two nights each week.
Results: The CR + SR group reduced sleep by 57 ± 36 min per day during SR days and increased sleep by 59 ± 38 min per day 
during ad libitum sleep days, resulting in a sleep reduction of 169 ± 75 min per week. The CR and CR + SR groups lost similar 
amounts of weight, lean mass, and fat mass. However, the proportion of total mass lost as fat was significantly greater 
(p = 0.016) in the CR group. This proportion was greater than body fat percentage at baseline for the CR (p = 0.0035), but not 
the CR + SR group. Resting respiratory quotient was reduced (p = 0.033) only in CR, and fasting leptin concentration was 
reduced only in CR + SR (p = 0.029).
Conclusions: Approximately 1 hr of SR on five nights a week led to less proportion of fat mass loss in individuals 
undergoing hypocaloric weight loss, despite similar weight loss. SR may adversely affect changes in body composition and 
“catch-up” sleep may not completely reverse it.

Statement of Significance
Previous studies suggest that sleep restriction during caloric restriction adversely affects weight-loss outcomes. This 
study extends previous findings by examining the effects of a much longer duration of intervention (8 weeks) using a ran-
domized controlled trial (caloric restriction alone or combined with sleep restriction). Furthermore, the sleep restriction 
was moderate, approximated 60 min shorter on the 5 days of restricted sleep each week. Ad libitum sleep was allowed on 
the other 2 days each week so that the sleep pattern mimicked real life. We found that sleep restriction resulted in less loss 
of fat but greater loss of lean mass among the total mass lost, despite similar weight loss between the two groups. Other 
metabolic changes were also observed.

 Introduction
Obesity is associated with serious health consequences [1–3] 
and caloric restriction (CR) is a widely used strategy to treat 
obesity. Many observational studies support an association 
between insufficient sleep and greater body weight and body 
fat [4]. Altered neuroendocrine factors [5–7], energy expend-
iture [8–12], and energy intake [13–16] have also been reported 
with restricted sleep. Therefore, sleep restriction (SR) may affect 
neuroendocrine responses and energy expenditure during CR 
and reduce the effects of CR on body weight and fat.
A previous study found a positive association between sleep 
duration and the loss of body fat in individuals who underwent 
an intervention involving 15–24 weeks of CR [17]. However, that 
study only determined baseline sleep using self-reported meas-
ures, which often differs from objective measures by at least 
1 hr [18] and did not have information regarding sleep during CR. 
In a study involving 14 days of CR, participants lost less fat mass 
when they spent 5.5 hr in bed per day than when they spent 
8.5 hr in bed per day [11]. Additionally, an intervention involving 
a 4 day controlled diet combined with short sleep (4 hr in bed 
per day) induced less weight loss compared with habitual sleep 
(9 hr in bed per day) [19]. These studies suggest that sleep plays 
a role in the loss of weight and fat mass during CR.
However, the results of these studies were limited to a short 
duration of intervention. Effects after a longer duration of SR 
may be different. For example, one study found that body weight 
was reduced after 1 week of SR but returned to baseline after 
an additional 2 weeks [20]. It is unknown whether SR during a 
longer duration of CR affects body weight and fat.
Furthermore, days of short sleep are often interspersed with 
longer sleep on other days in free-living individuals. A National 
Sleep Foundation survey showed that more than 40 per cent of 
the population self-reported that they slept longer during the 
weekend [21]. A recent cross-sectional study found that adults 
who “caught up” sleep during weekends had a significantly 
lower body mass index (BMI) than those who did not “catch 
up” sleep, and that each additional hour of weekend catch-up 
sleep was associated with a decrease of 0.12 kg/m2 in BMI [22]. 
However, different sleep timings and durations between work 
and free days have been shown to be associated with increased 
BMI [23]. Thus, the overall effect of catching up sleep follow-
ing SR on body weight is not clear; it is also unknown whether 
repeatedly catching up sleep after restricted sleep, over a period 
of CR, affects the adverse effects of insufficient sleep on body 
weight and fat suggested by aforementioned studies involving 
short interventions [11, 19].
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the 
effects of chronic SR with catch-up sleep on body weight and 
composition during an 8-week period of CR in overweight or 
obese adults. The 8-week SR involved 5 days of moderate SR 
and 2 days of ad libitum sleep per week. Additional outcomes 
of resting metabolic rate (RMR), respiratory quotient (RQ), and 
hormones related to appetite regulation were also explored.
Methods
The Weight Outlooks by Restriction of Diet and Sleep study was 
a randomized trial to examine the effects of SR on weight-loss 
outcomes in individuals who underwent CR. 
The study was regis-
tered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02413866). The research protocol 
was approved by the University of South Carolina Institutional 
Review Board, and all participants provided a signed informed 
consent.
Participants and screening
Participants from Columbia, South Carolina, and surround-
ing areas were recruited through local advertisements. All 
participants were 35–55 years old, overweight or obese (BMI 
of 25–40 kg·m−2), and weight stable (±3%) during the previous 
3 months. Their self-reported 24 hr sleep duration was 6.5–8 hr 
including naps. The primary exclusion criteria included the fol-
lowing: (1) self-reported medical conditions such as metabolic 
diseases, cardiovascular diseases, chronic or recurrent respira-
tory conditions, active cancer, sleeping, eating, or neurological 
disorders; (2) medications that affect metabolism; (3) use of med-
ications, devices, or hypnotics to assist sleep; (4) psychological 
issues such as untreated depression; (5) excessive caffeine use 
(>500 mg/day); (6) shift workers or work requiring long-distance 
driving or operating heavy equipment; (8) self-reported total nap 
duration > 90 min/day or excessive daytime sleepiness; and (9) 
pregnant, lactating, or women who were perimenopausal with 
irregular menses.
A total of 528 volunteers were initially screened via an online 
survey which included questions regarding age, height, weight, 
basic health information, and sleep habits, and 433 were ineli-
gible (Figure 1). The top reasons for being ineligible were BMI 
(n = 213), age (n = 48), weight not being stable (n = 41), medical 
issues (n = 40), being perimenopause (n = 37), and issues related 
to sleep (n = 36). Among the 95 eligible individuals, 62 attended 
an orientation session and were further screened at our research 
center. The screening included medical history review, blood 
pressure, and fasting blood test. Those with signs of serious 
diseases were excluded. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies 
Depression Scale (CESD) was used to exclude those with uncon-
trolled depression (CESD score > 16), and the Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale (ESS) was used to exclude those with high daytime sleepi-
ness (ESS score > 12).
Additionally, a 1 week run-in was used to familiarize par-
ticipants with self-monitoring procedures of the study. During 
this week, participants were instructed to record the times of 
going into bed and getting out of bed every night and any naps 
taken, and to wear an actigraphic monitor (GT3X+, ActiGraph 
LLC, Pensacola, FL) on their nondominant wrist for the week. 
An average time in bed (TIB) of <6 or >9 hr was used as fur-
ther exclusion criteria; however, no additional participants were 
excluded because of this. All participants were instructed to 
either use a mobile app “MyFitnessPal” (MyfitnessPal, Inc.) or to 
record on paper their food and drinks including the type and 
amount throughout the week. All paper records were entered 
into the web version of the app by study staff. This app provides 
total calorie and macronutrient intake for each recorded day. 
After these procedures, 51 individuals remained eligible in the 
study.
Interventions
Among the 51 individuals who were eligible for the study, 41 
completed all measurements at baseline and were randomized 
to one of two 8-week interventions: caloric restriction (CR) with

 or without sleep restriction (SR) (CR: n = 18; CR + SR: n = 23). We 
used a computer software to generate random group numbers 
(1 and 2), and each participant, upon finishing baseline meas-
urements, was assigned a number according to the sequence. 
Different sets of random group numbers were used for men and 
women. A set of five numbers were generated each time with 
two numbers for CR and three for CR + SR group. We used this 
2:3 ratio of group assignment because we anticipated greater 
retention rate for the CR group (85–90 per cent) than the CR + 
SR group (75–80 per cent). During the intervention, five partici-
pants dropped out of the study (three in CR and two in CR + 
SR). Among these individuals, four participants were not able to 
continue the required recording and visits for the study, and one 
participant was lost to follow-up for unknown reason. A total of 
36 participants completed the study (CR: n = 15; CR + SR: n = 21). 
During the 8 weeks, all participants were asked to maintain 
their usual daily activities throughout the study, and not to par-
ticipate in another interventional study.
Caloric restriction
The planned daily dietary level was approximately 95 per cent of 
each individual’s RMR measured by indirect calorimetry at base-
line. RMR accounts for 60–75 per cent of total energy expend-
iture. The participants were weight stable at enrollment, so 
their habitual energy intake equaled total energy expenditure. 
Therefore, the planned daily dietary level of approximately 95 
per cent of each individual’s RMR would be 57–71 per cent of 
their energy intake at baseline, or 29–43 per cent reduction. The 
total calories were divided among breakfast (25 per cent), lunch 
(30 per cent), dinner (35 per cent), and snack (10 per cent), and 
with approximately 30 per cent of calories from fat, 20 per cent 
from protein, and 50 per cent from carbohydrate. Lunch and

 dinner meals were provided for all participants for 4 days each 
week of their choice and were picked up by participants. Dietary 
guidelines were given to participants for breakfast and snack 
and the 3 free days of their choice of the week. A registered 
dietitian directed the development of meals to be provided, 
sample meal plans, and the dietary guidelines. All participants 
were instructed to record whether they consumed the provided 
meals and any extra food and caloric drink, and to record all 
breakfast meals, and food and drinks during the 3 free days. Our 
staff checked their dietary record and discussed any issues with 
them.
Sleep restriction
For the CR + SR group, participants were instructed to reduce 
their total TIB by 90 min for 5 days each week according to their 
preference of going to bed later and/or getting up earlier, and to 
maintain their usual napping habits. For the other 2 days of the 
week, they were allowed to sleep ad libitum and the 2 days could 
be nonconsecutive. They were instructed to maintain a similar 
sleep–wake timing during the 5 days of reduced TIB and minim-
ize the shift in sleep–wake timing between days. This SR proto-
col was adopted in order to reduce possible adverse events due 
to lack of sleep. More importantly, this allowed better mimicking 
of real life, where many individuals experience insufficient sleep 
during some days of the week and try to catch up on sleep dur-
ing other days.
All participants were instructed to record the times they 
went to bed, got up, and took naps every day, and to wear an 
actigraphic monitor (ActiGraph GT3X+, ActiGraph, Pensacola, 
FL) on their nondominant wrist throughout the intervention. 
The output from the monitors was analyzed using the manu-
facturer-provided software ActiLife 6.11. The Cole-Kripke algo-
rithm was used to determine minute-by-minute asleep/awake 
status [24]. Total sleep time (TST) was the total number of min-
utes scored as “asleep.” Total TIB was the total time from going 
into bed with lights out attempting sleep to getting up plus 
any naps during the day recorded by participants. The times 
recorded on the sleep logs were manually entered into the pro-
gram to quantify TIB. The GT3X+ provides objective measures of 
activity counts as well as information on the environment via 
an ambient light sensor. A standardized approach was used to 
define TIB [25]. Missing entries on logs and inaccurate recordings 
of bed/awake times were estimated or adjusted, respectively, 
based on the hierarchical ranking of inputs (i.e. sleep logs, light 
intensity, and activity counts) in order to improve the accuracy 
of the values. Our staff checked the self-reported bed time and 
actigraphic recording every week and discussed any issues with 
participants.
Measurements
All outcome measurements were performed at baseline and 
following the interventions. The measurements included body 
weight, body composition, RMR, and RQ. Blood samples were 
also collected. Body weight was additionally measured once 
a week during the interventions. For 1 week at baseline and 
throughout the interventions, participants wore the actigraphic 
monitor and were instructed to record the times of going into 
bed and getting out of bed every night and any naps taken. They 
were also instructed to record food intake daily for the same 
period. Furthermore, participants were instructed to complete 
the CESD, ESS, Functional Outcomes of Sleepiness (FOSQ), and 
psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) at baseline and every 2 weeks 
during the interventions to monitor changes that may be indi-
cative of substantial adverse effects.
Body weight and composition
Participants wore standard scrubs and without shoes or outer 
garments to have height and weight measured on a digital scale 
(Health O Meter Professional, Pelstar LLC, McCook, IL) which 
was calibrated according to manufacturer’s recommendations. 
At baseline and postintervention, body weights at two visits 
were averaged. Whole-body total mass, fat mass, lean mass, 
and percentage body fat were determined using dual-energy 
x-ray absorptiometry (DXA, enCORE, GE Healthcare model 8743, 
Waukesha, WI).
Resting metabolic rate and respiratory quotient
RMR was measured via indirect calorimetry using a ventilated 
hood after an overnight fast of at least 10 hr. A data-collection 
period of 30 min followed an approximately 15 min rest upon 
participant’s arrival at the laboratory. The participant remained 
quiet and still in the supine position throughout the entire pro-
cedure and were kept awake with continuous monitoring. The 
room was maintained in low light, noise was kept at minimum, 
and the temperature was maintained at a constant 26–30°C. The 
expired air was collected through a one-way valve and analyzed 
using a metabolic cart (TrueOne 2400, ParvoMedics, Salt Lake 
City, UT) which was calibrated on each day of measurement 
following the manufacturer’s instructions. RMR was calculated 
from each determination of O2 consumption and CO2 produc-
tion during the testing period with a constant airflow rate into 
the hood using Weir’s equation [26]. The first 8 and last 2 min of 
data were excluded to avoid unstable measurements, and the 
average value of the middle 20 min was calculated. RQ was cal-
culated using the same time period. All testing procedures took 
place in the morning between 0600–0800 hr and at least 24 hr 
after any structured exercise.
Blood sample collection and analysis
Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and postin-
tervention. Participants were instructed to fast (not includ-
ing water) for at least 12 hr prior to blood draw visits. Serum 
samples were collected and stored at −80°C degrees until ana-
lysis. Before analysis of ghrelin and leptin, serum samples 
were thawed and recentrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min 
to remove any potential particulates. A multiplex immunoassay 
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) was used to quantify con-
centrations of ghrelin and leptin per manufacturer instructions 
on a Magpix multiplexing system (Luminex, Austin, TX). All 
samples were run in duplicates.
Other questionnaires and tests
The CESD, ESS, FOSQ, and PVT were used to evaluate changes 
in participants’ depressive symptom, sleepiness, daily function, 
and alertness that may occur during intervention. No partici-
pant reported scores indicative of clinical depression (CESD > 
16), excessive sleepiness (ESS > 12), or a change of >10 per cent 
in FOSQ during the intervention; therefore, no one was excluded 
due to these tests. The PVT was a 2 min online test of neurobe-
havioral function. It has been shown that a 2-min PVT provided 
similar trend of deterioration as the standard 10-min PVT across

 a night of sustained wakefulness [27]. The mean response time 
during the test period was reported for each test in milliseconds. 
An increase in response time to >500 ms during the interven-
tion was considered indication of deteriorated response to be 
excluded from the study. All participants had PVT response 
time of <500 ms, except one participant who had consistent PVT 
response time of >500 ms (range: 501–517 ms) during the study 
and therefore was not advised to stop participating.
Statistics
There were no data available in the literature regarding the 
effect size of the differences between CR and CR + SR after 8 
weeks in the changes in body weight and body fat. The study by 
Nedeltcheva et al. investigated body composition changes after 
14 days [11]; however, it is difficult to estimate changes after 8 
weeks based on their data given that different components of 
body mass are lost at different rates over time [28]. Therefore, 
sample size was estimated based on detecting an interaction, 
between the change in fat mass with intervention and group, 
at standardized effect sizes of small to medium, with 80 per 
cent power and an α of 0.05. A correlation of 0.8–0.9 between 
fat mass at baseline and postintervention, as shown in our pre-
vious dietary intervention study [29], was used. A total sample 
size of 30–40 (equal samples sizes in CR and CR + SR) would pro-
vide 80 per cent power to detect a small-to-medium effect size 
of f = 0.125–0.15 for the interaction, at an α of 0.05. This would 
indicate significantly different changes in fat mass in the two 
groups.
Descriptive statistics for variables were calculated. Data are 
presented as mean ± SD or percentage. Medians (interquartile 
range) are also presented for non-normally distributed data. Chi-
square test was used to compare categorical variables between 
intervention groups at baseline. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
with repeated measures including a time × group interaction 
was used to determine whether the two groups had different 
changes in outcome variables. Body weight, composition, and 
sleep variables before and after the intervention within each 
group were compared by using paired t-tests. Covariates that 
were adjusted included baseline body weight, weight change, 
baseline body fat, fat mass change, sex, and race. Additionally, 
change values were calculated by subtracting baseline values 
from postintervention values. They were compared between the 
CR and CR + SR groups by independent t-test (or Mann–Whitney 
U-test when normality distribution of data was not met). To 
determine whether changes in body composition with inter-
ventions were proportional to baseline body composition, the 
amount of body fat lost as a percentage of total mass lost was 
compared with baseline body fat percentage using paired t-test 
or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, as appropriate. Other outcomes 
including RMR, RQ, leptin, and ghrelin were analyzed similarly. 
Linear regression was used to determine correlations between 
concentration changes of ghrelin and leptin, and body compos-
ition variables.
The primary analyses included participants who completed 
the study (n = 36). Additional intent-to-treat analyses included 
all participants who were assigned an intervention group 
(n = 41) including those who dropped out before postinterven-
tion measurements (n = 5). For those who did not complete the 
study, the last measured body weight was used as postinterven-
tion weight. Because body composition, RMR, and RQ were only 
available at baseline, their baseline values were used as values 
after intervention. Analyses were conducted in the same man-
ner as the primary analyses. A p-value of <0.05 was considered 
statistically significant and Bonferroni adjustments were used 
(p-value of 0.05/number of comparisons) as appropriate, which 
are indicated below. Data were analyzed using SAS statistical 
package (version 9.4, Cary, NC).
Results
Baseline characteristics
Participant characteristics at baseline for the 36 participants 
who completed baseline measurements are shown in Table 1 
by assigned groups. The participants were approximately 80 
per cent females and 61 per cent African American. The median 
income was $50,000–$59,000 and 44 per cent were married. 
There were no differences between the CR and CR + SR groups in 
age, sex composition, race composition, height, lean body mass, 
percent body fat, RQ, or average daily TIB and TST. However, body 
weight, BMI, DXA total mass, fat mass, and RMR were signifi-
cantly greater in the CR + SR group than the CR group. The five 
participants who dropped out the study before completion and 
the 36 participants who completed the study had similar aver-
age age, body composition, TIB, and TST at baseline (all p values 
> 0.05).
Intervention—calorie intake
The self-reported average daily calorie intake for the CR group 
was 1575 ± 357 kcal/day and for the CR + SR group was 1775 ± 579 
kcal/day at baseline before randomization. During the 8 week 
intervention, 25 (69.4 per cent) of the 36 participants who com-
pleted the study provided at least 75 per cent of dietary intake 
records. The CR group had calorie intake of 1389 ± 328 kcal/day 
during intervention and 1260 ± 632 kcal/day postintervention. 
The CR + SR group had calorie intake of 1454 ± 406 kcal/day dur-
ing intervention and 1488 ± 291 kcal/day postintervention. The 
calorie intake during intervention was approximately 14 ± 9% 
and 16 ± 9% lower than baseline values for the CR and CR + SR 
groups, respectively.
Intervention—time in bed and total sleep time
The mean TIB of each week during intervention for the CR and 
CR + SR groups is shown in Figure 2, A and B, respectively. For 
the CR group, the TIB ranged between 428 and 451 min per day 
throughout the intervention. For the CR + SR group, the TIB range 
was 371–390 min per day each week for the sleep-restricted days 
and 494–536 min per day for the ad libitum sleep days. The dif-
ference in TIB between the sleep-restricted days and ad libitum 
days ranged from 112 to as much as 153 min per day each week. 
Comparing to baseline, the TIB on the days they restricted sleep 
was 65 ± 38 min per day shorter, and the TIB on the ad libitum 
sleep days was 65 ± 37 min longer than at baseline (p < 0.001 
for both). The total TIB reduced during the intervention was 
185 ± 63 min per week.
Similarly, the mean TST values for the CR and CR + SR groups 
are shown in Figure 3, A and B, respectively. Throughout the 
8 weeks, TST ranged between 371 and 397 min per day each

 week for the CR group, and 324–356 min on restricted sleep 
days and 438–473 min on ad libitum sleep days for the CR + SR 
group. For the CR + SR group, the difference in TST between the 
sleep-restricted days and ad libitum days ranged 102–140 min 
per day per week. Comparing to baseline, the TST on the days 
they restricted sleep was 57 ± 36 min shorter per day, and on the

The CR and CR + SR groups did not have different changes in 
body weight, body composition, or resting metabolic variables 
(p > 0.16 for time × group interactions). Table 2 includes the 
changes in each variable after interventions by group. The fat 
mass change relative to baseline fat mass and the lean body 
mass change relative to baseline lean body mass were also simi-
lar between the two groups (p = 0.60 and 0.81, respectively).
Interestingly, the amount of DXA-assessed fat mass lost as a 
proportion of total mass lost was greater in the CR than CR + SR 
group, with median proportions of 83 and 58 per cent, respectively. 
In contrast, the amount of lean mass lost as a proportion of total 
mass lost was less in the CR than the CR + SR group, with median 
proportions of 17 and 39 per cent, respectively. In both groups, body 
weight, total mass, fat mass, lean body mass, and percent body fat 
decreased (p < 0.05 for all). RMR did not change in either group (CR: 
p = 0.074; CR + SR: p = 0.99). A significant reduction in RQ (p = 0.033) 
was found in the CR but not CR + SR group (p = 0.78).
In addition, in the CR group, the amount of fat lost as a per-
centage of the total mass lost was greater than baseline percent 
body fat (p = 0.0035), suggesting body composition changes favor-
ing decreased body fat. However, in the CR + SR group, the amount 
of fat lost as a percentage of the total mass lost was not different 
from baseline body fat (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.81).
After adjustment for baseline body weight, all the above find-
ings remained unchanged. Similarly, adjustment for sex in the 
comparisons between CR and CR + SR did not affect any results. 
After race was added to the model, there were still no differ-
ences between CR and CR + SR in the changes in body weight, 
percent weight loss, total mass, fat mass, percent body fat, RMR, 
or RQ. However, a significant group × race interaction was found 
for lean body mass change (p = 0.048), suggesting CR and CR + 
SR interventions had different effects in African American and 
Caucasian participants. Further analyses did not show signifi-
cant differences among the combinations of race and group (p 
> 0.05 for all).

 Additionally, significant racial differences were found for a 
few outcome variables. African American participants had sig-
nificantly less loss of total mass and fat mass than Caucasians 
(Table 3). Because these post hoc tests shown in Table 3 compared 
the same variables between races as in Table 2 between groups, 
Bonferroni adjustments were applied in consideration of multiple 
comparisons (p < 0.05/2 = 0.025). Fat mass loss relative to baseline 
fat mass was also less in African Americans (p = 0.0048; Caucasian: 
−7.9 ± 3.2%; African American: −3.4 ± 4.8%). Body weight, fat mass, 
lean body mass, and percent body fat significant decreased in both 
African American and Caucasian participants (p < 0.05 for all). The 
changes in RMR were also different between the two races; RMR 
increased in African Americans (p = 0.017), but did not change in 
Caucasians (p = 0.11). RQ did not change in either race (p = 0.067 
and 0.36 for Caucasians and African Americans, respectively).
Interventional effects—ghrelin and leptin
Serum samples at both baseline and postintervention were 
available from 12 participants in the CR group (3 males, 5 
Caucasians) and 11 in the CR + SR (2 males, 6 Caucasians). The 
CR and CR + SR groups did not have different changes in serum 
concentrations of ghrelin and leptin (p > 0.33 for time × group 
interactions). In the entire sample, ghrelin concentration did not 
change significantly (p = 0.059), but leptin concentration signifi-
cantly decreased (p = 0.018).
Table 4 includes serum concentrations of ghrelin and leptin 
at baseline and absolute changes and changes relative to base-
line values by assignment groups. The concentrations at base-
line and changes following interventions were similar between 
CR and CR + SR groups. In the CR group, ghrelin and leptin con-
centrations did not change following the intervention (p = 0.31 
and 0.28, respectively). In the CR + SR group, ghrelin concentra-
tion did not increase significantly (p = 0.069) but leptin signifi-
cantly decreased (p = 0.029).
With adjustment for baseline weight, weight change, base-
line fat mass, fat mass change, sex, or race, ghrelin and leptin 
concentrations at baseline and their changes after interventions 
were still not different between CR and CR + SR groups (all p val-
ues > 0.10). In the entire sample, leptin concentration no longer

 significantly changed after adjustment for baseline weight, 
weight change, or baseline fat mass (p = 0.057, 0.43, and 0.15, 
respectively), but still decreased after adjustment for fat mass 
change (p = 0.044). In the CR + SR group, leptin was no longer 
changed after adjustment for baseline weight, weight change, 
baseline fat mass, or fat mass change (p = 0.057, 0.39, 0.063, 0.11, 
respectively). Additionally, the changes in ghrelin and leptin 
were not correlated with changes in body weight or fat mass 
(without or with adjustment for baseline weight) in the entire 
sample (p > 0.34 for all).
Intent-to-treat analyses
Results from intent-to-treat analyses were largely the same as the 
results from participants who completed the study. There were no 
differences in the two groups in the amount of changes in body 
weight, percent weight loss, fat mass, lean body mass, percent 
body fat, RMR, or RQ between CR and CR + SR groups (p values 
ranged from 0.17 to 0.95). In both groups, body weight, fat mass, 
lean body mass, and percent body fat decreased (p < 0.05 for all). 
The weight lost for the CR and CR + SR groups were −2.7 ± 3.2 kg 
(−3.1 ± 3.4%) and −2.9 ± 2.7 kg (−2.8 ± 2.6%), respectively. A signifi-
cant reduction in RQ (p = 0.034) was also found in the CR but not 
CR + SR group (p = 0.78). The proportions of fat and lean mass lost 
among the total mass lost (by DXA) were not calculated because 
the change values of fat mass, lean mass, and total mass equaled 
to 0 for participants who dropped out the study (n = 5) with base-
line values used as postintervention values.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study had the longest 
intervention among studies that have examined the effects 
of moderately restricted sleep duration on weight-loss out-
comes in the context of hypocaloric diet. We found that there 
was a similar amount of weight loss, but the total mass lost 
was composed of a greater percentage of lean mass and less 
percentage of fat mass in the CR + SR group compared with 
the CR group. The amount of fat mass as a percentage of total 
mass lost was greater than body fat percentage at baseline 
in the CR but not different in the CR + SR group. Also, our 
exploratory analyses showed RQ decreased only in the CR 
group, suggesting a shift toward greater fat oxidation at rest, 
but fasting serum leptin concentration decreased only in the 
CR + SR group. Additionally, post hoc analyses showed that 
African-American participants lost less total mass and fat 
mass than Caucasian participants.
Only a few previous studies have examined the effects of 
restricted sleep during weight loss on body composition. In a 
study by Nedeltcheva et al., 10 participants completed a cross-
over study involving two 14-day periods of CR conditions, one 
with 5.5 hr TIB and one with 8.5 hr TIB [11]. The 5.5 hr TIB 
resulted in less loss of weight as fat (an average of 25 per cent) 
than the 8.5 hr TIB (56 per cent), but the amount of weight lost 
was similar. RQ was greater and RMR was lower after 5.5 hr TIB. 
Our results were consistent with the study of Nedeltcheva et al. 
in that we also showed less loss of total mass as fat when sleep 
was shorter. Also consistent with the Nedeltcheva study, the CR 
group in our study showed a shift toward greater oxidation of 
fat, but the CR + SR group did not show a change. Therefore, 
our study extended the findings to a much longer duration of 
intervention, using a randomized group design. Further, consist-
ent with results from previous weight loss studies without sleep 
intervention [30, 31], we showed that the CR group lost a greater 
percentage of fat mass within the total mass lost than the base-
line body fat percentage. This was not observed in the CR + 
SR group. Although these differences between the two groups 
did not result in different body fat percentages after interven-
tions, this likely was due to the small amount of total mass loss. 
However, these results support that SR adversely influences 
body composition changes during CR resulting in less utiliza-
tion of fat.
In another study of normal weight participants, St-Onge 
et al. found that 4 days of controlled dietary intake combined 
with short sleep (4 hr TIB per day) elicited less weight loss than 
4 days of controlled diet with habitual sleep (9 hr TIB) (1.7 ± 0.4 
vs. 2.2 ± 0.4 lb) [19]. Our study did not find a difference in the 
amount of weight loss (absolute or relative to baseline weight) 
between CR and CR + SR groups. The degree of CR over a shorter 
period may have resulted in their different finding; the CR in the 
study by St-Onge [19] appeared to be greater than the one by 
Nedeltcheva et al. [11] and the present study, given the amount 
of weight loss after 4 days, compared with 14 days and 8 weeks. 
We cannot determine whether weight loss would be less in the 
CR + SR group if calories were restricted to a greater degree in 
our study.
Ghrelin and leptin are two hormones that have been rec-
ognized to have a major influence on energy balance [32, 33]. 
Previous clinical studies involving SR showed inconsistent 
results as indicated by others [34, 35]. Leptin is a mediator of 
long-term regulation of energy balance and induces weight loss 
by suppression of food intake; ghrelin is a fast-acting hormone, 
functioning as an appetite-stimulating signal [32]. Therefore, 
the inconsistent results in previous studies may be related to 
the degree of energy imbalance and the length of intervention. 
Other factors such as the sensitivity of receptors may also com-
plicate the issue. In the CR + SR group of our study, fasting leptin 
decreased by 24 per cent and ghrelin showed a trend for increase 
by 26 per cent, suggesting an energy deficiency state [36] which 
may reflect a greater energy need, and greater potential to initi-
ate greater energy intake, which would put these individuals at 
risk for regaining the lost weight. These changes were absent in 
CR group; the absence of a significant reduction in leptin may in 
part be due to the small amount of fat mass loss which was not 
enough for the body to sense energy deficiency. Results of this 
study, although exploratory in nature, suggest that SR increases

 the risk for weight regain after weight loss. However, further 
investigation of the hormonal changes beyond fasting concen-
trations to include receptor sensitivity, amplitude of change with 
meals (for ghrelin) with larger sample sizes, is recommended.
Additionally, this study showed that African-American par-
ticipants lost less total mass and less fat than Caucasian partici-
pants. Previous studies have shown similar findings with weight 
loss interventions [37, 38]. In one study, African-American 
women lost 3.6 kg less weight than Caucasian women matched 
for initial body weight during 6 months of weight loss interven-
tion, despite similar adherence to the prescribed CR and phys-
ical activity [38]. This study again draws attention to the racial 
disparity in weight loss with a similar intervention. Despite the 
differences in the amount of total mass and fat loss, SR resulted 
in less loss of mass as fat for African-American and Caucasian 
participants combined. Epidemiological research suggests that 
short sleep duration is more likely to be associated with being 
overweight or obese among African Americans than among 
Caucasians [39]. Our study, however, was underpowered to 
detect potentially different effects of SR between the two racial 
groups on body weight and composition.
We cannot explain the statistically significant increase (an 
average of 6.9 per cent) in RMR in African-American partici-
pants. Contrary to our results, previous research found that 
RMR decreased less in Caucasians than in African Americans 
[38], and the decrease in RMR was proportional to changes in 
body weight and composition in Caucasian but not in African-
American women [37].
An important strength of this study is the relatively long 
duration of the intervention (8 weeks). This duration was longer 
than previous SR studies in the context of dietary weight loss. 
The objective measurement of sleep using actigraphy through-
out the study is another strength of the study. Also, the degree 
of SR in our study was less than in other studies: TIB on those 
restricted sleep days were approximately 60 min shorter than at 
baseline (and the group without SR), and 120 min shorter than 
that on ad libitum sleep days. When averaged over the week 
during intervention, the TIB was only 185 min less per week 
(or 26 min per day). These were in contrast to the 3-hr differ-
ence between conditions in one study [11] and 5-hr difference 
in another study [19]. The amount of SR was less than what we 
planned initially. This was likely because we did not emphasize 
to participants the amount of SR during intervention, but only 
instructed them to reduce TIB by 90 min. On the other hand, 
this study provided evidence that approximately 60 min of sleep 
reduction on five nights per week for several weeks was safe and 
tolerable by individuals who were not long sleepers (TIB ≤ 9 hr).
Another unique aspect of our study was that participants 
were allowed to sleep ad libitum on 2 days each week. Some 
evidence indicates that differential sleep duration and timing 
between days is associated with increased BMI [23]; thus, results 
of this study may not be completely due to the restricted sleep. 
On the other hand, other research indicates that adults who 
caught up sleep during weekends had a significantly lower BMI 
than those who did not catch up sleep [22]. We conducted post 
hoc analyses to address the association of change in body weight 
and composition with total amount of sleep loss and catch-up 
sleep. Neither average weekly sleep loss (across all 7 days) nor 
the increase in sleep on ad libitum days versus baseline was sig-
nificantly correlated with any of the body weight or composition 
measures. These data suggest that the catch-up sleep in our 
study neither attenuated nor exacerbated the effects of SR on 
body weight or fat mass. It is also possible that the extent of the 
SR was not large enough to hinder weight loss.
Our results demonstrate adverse effects of chronic SR even 
when weight loss was relatively small; however, these results 
cannot be directly generalized to greater amount of weight loss. 
The different body weight and fat mass between groups at base-
line were also a limitation. However, this unbalanced weight 
and fat between groups unlikely affected the findings regarding 
the intervention effects because the results remained the same 
when baseline body weight was adjusted, and weight and fat 
loss relative to baseline values were similar between groups.
Another limitation was that CR was primarily self-directed, 
which likely resulted in the lower than planned degree of CR. It 
is possible that SR has affected caloric/macronutrient intake, and 
the ghrelin and leptin data suggest that participants in the CR + SR 
group would have been more inclined to eat more. However, self-
reported dietary intake did not indicate different caloric intake 
between the two groups; the degree of CR may have limited our 
ability to detect small differences in caloric intake. Furthermore, 
we were not able to accurately determine the actual degree of CR 
or modification of diet in individuals given the well-known bias of 
self-reported dietary intake [40]. Nonetheless, providing lunches 
and dinners on 4 days each week provided meal samples for par-
ticipants and helped us to reduce the potential effects of SR on 
modifying diet. Also, meal timing may change with SR which may 
have metabolic effects; however, we did not ask participants to 
record timing of each meal. Additionally, the small sample size 
was a limitation, especially limiting our ability to analyze data by 
intervention groups and races.
In summary, this study showed that moderate SR, approxi-
mately 60 min reduction in sleep on 5 days a week and ad libitum 
sleep on the other 2 days, resulted in a less proportion of fat loss 
but a greater proportion of lean mass loss among the total mass 
lost in overweight and obese adults undergoing moderate CR. Our 
data also suggested differential changes in appetite regulatory 
hormones, which suggest the group which had SR may have a 
greater risk for weight regain. Future studies are recommended 
to examine whether these body composition results occur with a 
greater degree of chronic CR, and to further investigate hormonal 
changes and whether weight regain afterwards would be affected.
