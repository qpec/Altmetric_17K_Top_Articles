Abstract
The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake led to a subsequent nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In its wake,
we sought to examine the association between externalradiation dose and thyroid cancer in Fukushima Prefecture. We applied a cross-
sectional study design with 300,476 participants aged 18 years and younger who underwent thyroid examinations between October
2011 and June 2015. Areas within Fukushima Prefecture were divided into three groups based on individual external doses (≥1% of
5mSv, <99% of 1mSv/y, and the other). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals of thyroid cancer for all areas, with the
lowest dose area as reference, were calculated using logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex. Furthermore, the ORs of
thyroid cancer for individual external doses of 1mSv or more and 2mSv or more, with the external dose less than 1mSv as reference,
were calculated. Prevalence of thyroid cancer for the location groups were 48/100,000 for the highest dose area, 36/100,000 for the
middle dose area, and 41/100,000 for the lowest dose area. Compared with the lowest dose area, age-, and sex-adjusted ORs (95%
confidence intervals) for the highest-dose and middle-dose areas were 1.49 (0.36–6.23) and 1.00 (0.67–1.50), respectively. The
duration between accident and thyroid examination was not associated with thyroid cancer prevalence. There were no significant
associations between individual external doses and prevalence of thyroid cancer. External radiation dose was not associated with
thyroid cancer prevalence among Fukushima children within the first 4 years after the nuclear accident.

1. Introduction
The Great East Japan Earthquake struck Japan on March 11,
2011. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), causing it to release
radioactive elements into the surrounding area.
One of the main adverse health consequences of radiation
among exposed young people is a substantial rise in thyroid
cancer rates.[1,2] To address this concern, Fukushima Prefecture
started ultrasonographic examinations of the thyroid glands of its
residents aged 18 years and younger 6 months after the
accident.[3] Based on the preliminary results of the dose estimates,
the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2013 and the United
Nations Scientific Committee on the Effect of Atomic Radiation
in 2015 concluded that the public health impact of radiation
exposure from the incident was limited.[4,5] However, a recent
study reported that residents of this age group living in
Fukushima Prefecture in 2011 had approximately 30-fold excess
risk of thyroid cancer compared with the national dataset of the
Japanese National Cancer Center,[6] and a prevalence odds ratio
(OR) compared with a reference district in Fukushima of 2.6,
although this was not relative to the least contaminated area.[6]

 To clarify this inconsistency, as the responsible and practical
organization of the Fukushima Health Management Survey
(FHMS), we sought to examine the associations between
prevalence of thyroid cancer and radiation dose, and between
the prevalence and the duration from accident to thyroid
examination, among Fukushima residents, on a basis of the final
results of the first round thyroid examination data collected from
more than 300,000 residents aged 18 years and younger. To
determine the dose of radiation, we used an estimated external
radiation dose based on individual behavioral data because of the
limited availability of information on internal exposure to 131I.
Since internal exposure was closely associated with incidence
of thyroid cancer among children after the Chernobyl NPP
accident,[2] we further used a thyroid dose, including internal
exposure, as estimated by the WHO report.[4] The authors
hypothesize that there is no major geographical difference in the
prevalence ratios of thyroid cancer because the dose of radiation
in Fukushima was extremely lower compared with the amounts
observed in the Chernobyl NPP accident.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
Subjects were all inhabitants aged between 0 and 18 on
March 11, 2011 in Fukushima Prefecture, a target population
of 367,685. The first thyroid examinations were conducted from
October 2011 through June 2015 as a part of the FHMS.[3] The
first examinations started in 13 Evacuation Zone municipalities,
then proceeded in the Nakadori (Central Fukushima), Iwaki, and
Soma areas (on the Pacific coast below and above the Evacuation
Zone), and the Aizu area (inland). Through April 2015, 300,476
subjects (81.7%), including evacuees currently living in other
prefectures, were examined. The Ethics Committee of the
Fukushima Medical University approved this study (#1318).
Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all
surveyed children.
2.2. Thyroid ultrasound screening program
Ultrasonography was used for thyroid gland examinations
(detailed protocol reported elsewhere).[3,7–9] Thyroid volume,
nodules, cysts, and other findings, such as congenital defects and
ectopic thymus were recorded. Secondary confirmatory exami-
nations were recommended when the ultrasonography findings
met the following criteria: nodules 5⋅1mm or more or cysts 20.1
mm or more; or immediate need for confirmatory examination
for clinical reasons. In total, 2294 participants were recom-
mended secondary confirmatory examinations, of which 2056
(89.6%) completed them through July 2015.
The secondary confirmatory examinations included further
ultrasonography, blood test, urinalysis, and fine-needle aspira-
tion cytology (FNAC) if needed. Of 2056 participants, 537
(26.1%) underwent FNAC. Among them, 113 participants had
nodules classified as suspicious or malignant and 99 participants
received
surgical
treatment.
Finally,
98
participants
were
diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma.
2.3. External radiation dose estimation
The Basic Survey of the FHMS for external radiation dose
estimation (whose methods are detailed elsewhere)[10] was
launched four months after the NPP accident. The self-
administered questionnaire was prepared to collect information
from all residents (n=2,055,533) in Fukushima Prefecture
concerning residence, places visited, length of time spent indoors
and outdoors, and travelling time during the period from March
11 to July 11, 2011. Individual external doses were estimated by
digitizing these behavior data and comparing against computa-
tions of daily gamma ray dose rate maps drawn after the NPP
accident. Of all residents, 541,653 (26.4%) returned the
questionnaire through June 30, 2014. The distributions of
individual external doses of the respondents for the first 4 months
(excluding radiation workers) were as follows: less than 1 mSv,
62.0%; less than 2 mSv, 94.0%; and less than 3mSv, 99.4%.
We used the distribution data for 59 municipalities in these
analyses.[10,11] Among 541,653 participants, 129,321 participants
wereincludedinthethyroidultrasoundexaminationprogram,and
individual doses were used to analyze the association between
thyroid cancer and the external radiation dose.
2.4. Statistical analysis
In the present study, we consider thyroid cancer to be thyroid
cancer as detected by FNAC (113 cases). After excluding one
case, which was diagnosed as benign thyroid nodule after
operation, there remained 112 cases for analysis.
Regarding radiation dose, we used the FHMS individual
external dose distribution data.[9,10] Doses were classified into
three location groups according to the distributions of doses for
municipalities in Fukushima: highest dose area (≥1% of the
municipality received an external radiation exposure of ≥5mSv:
2 municipalities, Group A), middle dose area (<1% of the
municipality received ≥5mSv, <99.9% received �1mSv: 39
municipalities, Group B), and lowest dose area (≥99.9% received
�1mSv: 18 municipalities, Group C; Fig. 1). The aforementioned
2013 WHO postdisaster health risk assessment report[4] likewise
classified thyroid doses into three groups by location with a
classification generally consistent with ours. Notably, the highest
dose area was exactly the same as the “Group 1” defined in the
WHO report.
The ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of thyroid cancer
for all areas, with the lowest dose area as reference, were
calculated using logistic regression models adjusted for age and
sex. Furthermore, we calculated the ORs and CIs of thyroid
cancer for the duration from accident to thyroid examination,
and included this in the final models.
Regarding data on individual external radiation doses,
the proportion of external doses of 1mSv or more among
participants with thyroid cancer was compared to that of
participants without thyroid cancer. The ORs and 95% CIs of
thyroid cancer for external doses of 1mSv or more and 2mSv or
more, using an external dose of less than 1mSv as a control
reference, were calculated using logistic regression models
adjusted for age and sex. SAS software (version 9.3; SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for analyses. All
probability values for statistical tests were 2-tailed, with P values
less than 0.05 regarded as statistically significant.
3. Results
Table 1 shows the participants’ characteristics, and Fig. 2 shows
the age distribution of the cases at the time of the accident as well
as the age distribution at diagnosis with thyroid cancer. The
number of cases increased with age, and these were similar in
distribution. Table 2 shows age- and sex-adjusted ORs and 95%
CIs for thyroid cancer according to location group based on the

 first 4-month external radiation doses estimated by the FHMS.
Prevalence of thyroid cancer for the location groups were 48/
100,000 for Group A, 36/100,000 for Group B, and 41/100,000
for Group C. Compared with the lowest dose area (Group C),
age- and sex-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for Group A (the highest
dose area) and Group B (the middle dose area) were 1.49
(0.36–6.23) and 1.00 (0.67–1.50), respectively. The duration
from accident to thyroid examination was not associated with
the prevalence of thyroid cancer. The age- and sex-adjusted OR
(95% CI) of thyroid cancer for each 1-year increment of duration
was 0.86 (0.68–1.08). Furthermore, we analyzed the association
stratified by location group. The age- and sex-adjusted ORs (95%
CI) of thyroid cancer for each 1-year increment of duration were
1.36 (0.17–11.11) for Group A, 0.84 (0.61–1.16) for Group B,
and 0.70 (0.38–1.26) for Group C. We observed no interactions
between radiation dose and the duration from the nuclear
accident to the thyroid examination (P>0.20).
When we used the first-year thyroid doses estimated by the
WHO to classify location groups, the association between dose
and thyroid cancer prevalence was similar to that estimated by
the FHMS (Table 3). The age- and sex-adjusted ORs (95% CIs)
for the highest dose (Group 1) and middle dose (Group 2) areas
were 1.50 (0.37–6.15) and 1.01 (0.69–1.47), respectively.
Fifty-six cases had data on the individual external radiation
dose. Of these participants with thyroid cancer, 38 (0.05%)
participants had an external radiation dose <1 mSV, 17 (0.04%)
had a dose of 1 mSV or more and less than 2 mSV, and 1 (0.01%)
had a dose of 2 mSV ore more among 129,321 participants with
external radiation dose data. When we analyzed the relationship
between thyroid cancer and the individual external radiation
dose, we found no significant association between them. The age
and sex-adjusted ORs and 95% CIs for thyroid cancer for
individual external radiation doses of 1 mSV or more and less
than 2 mSV, and 2 mSV or more, with an external dose less
than 1 mSV as a reference, were 0.76 (0.43–1.35) and 0.24
(0.03–1.74), respectively.
4. Discussion
We found that regional differences in radiation dose, as estimated
by either the FHMS or WHO, were not associated with thyroid
cancer prevalence among children in Fukushima in the four years
after the NPP accident, and the duration from accident to thyroid
examination was not associated with the prevalence of thyroid
cancer in any dose area. Furthermore, there were no significant
associations between the individual external radiation doses and
prevalence of thyroid cancer. Along with the slow-growing
nature of thyroid cancer,[12,13] these findings suggest that the
prevalence of thyroid cancer in Fukushima has been influenced by
factors, such as detection rate using ultrasonography,[14] other
than the effects of low dose radiation exposure, and this is in line
with the WHO and United Nations Scientific Committee on the
Effect of Atomic Radiation reports.[4,5]
In the present study, only a few cases of thyroid cancer were
diagnosed in children under 10 years old in any dose area,
whereas excessive cases of thyroid cancer among younger
children, especially aged between 0 and 4 years, were reported

 after the accident at the Chernobyl NPP in 1986,[2] which were
caused by internal radiation exposure to 131I through the intake
of contaminated milk. The internal exposure to 131I among
children in Fukushima, even in the highest contaminated areas,
was much smaller than that of the Chernobyl evacuees.[15,16]
Although we used external radiation dose data only to examine
the associations between radiation dose and thyroid cancer, the
relatively highest dose area in the present study was exactly the
same as that defined in the WHO report, which estimated total
thyroid dose including internal exposure.[4] Although individual
thyroid dose is diverse rather than external dose, area grouping
might be corresponding to collective thyroid dose equivalent as
well as collective external dose.
Recently, regional differences in the prevalence of thyroid
cancer in Fukushima were reported[6] using interim results of the
FHMS (through December 2014): the central middle district of
the prefecture showed a higher prevalence OR. However, this
study suffered from fundamental limitations: unsuitable geo-
graphic classifications, disregard of the slow-growing nature of
thyroid cancer and its relation with radiation dose, and
inappropriate statistical methods.[12,17–19] On the other hand,
the observed prevalence of thyroid cancer in the present study

 was higher than the expected prevalence calculated by a life-table
method using the national estimates of thyroid cancer incidence
rates from 2001–10.[20] The observed and estimated prevalence
of thyroid cancer among residents in Fukushima aged 20 years or
less was 160.1 and 5.2, respectively.[20] Although the discrepancy
in the prevalence of thyroid cancer might be explained by
methodological differences in detecting thyroid cancer and mass
screening effects,[9] we should also carefully examine the
potential for effects of radiation dose or overdiagnosis on the
high prevalence of thyroid cancer in the secondary evaluation and
future surveys.
The first limitation of the present study is that low exposure
doses (especially compared with those at Chernobyl) and small
inter-regional dose differences within Fukushima made it difficult
to obtain discernible statistical results. Secondly, we did not
examine confounding factors such as body mass index or dietary
iodine intake.[21] Thirdly, the response rate to the questionnaire
to estimate external doses in the present study was relatively low
and this may affect the results, although the estimated external
doses were representative of dose distribution for the whole
population of each area.[22] Fourthly, the thyroid cancers
observed in the present study are likely a mixture of prevalent
and incident cases. This may lead to an underestimation of the
association between radiation dose and thyroid cancer. However,
the duration from the accident to the thyroid examination was
not associated with the prevalence of thyroid cancer in any dose
area in the present study. Therefore, we speculate that the
incidence rate of thyroid cancer might not increase within the first
four years after the NPP accident. Finally, because the mean
duration from accident to diagnosis was only two years, the time
may be short to expect to find radiation-related cases. The
incidence of thyroid cancer in children and adolescents increased
four years after the Chernobyl NPP accident,[13] although no
systematic studies had been conducted within four years of the
NPP accident. Therefore, in addition to the present study, follow-
up surveys should be conducted for several years before any
conclusions can be drawn.
In conclusion, there were no associations between the
prevalence of thyroid cancer and regional and individual
differences in radiation doses, or between the prevalence and
the duration from accident to thyroid examination, among
children in Fukushima within four years of the NPP accident. The
results of a follow-up survey, which started in April 2014, should
help clarify the effects of low-dose radiation exposure on the
incidence of thyroid cancer in Fukushima.
