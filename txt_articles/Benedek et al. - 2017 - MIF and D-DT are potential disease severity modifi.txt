Little is known about mechanisms that drive the development of
progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), although inflammatory factors,
such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), its homolog
D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT), and their common receptor
CD74 may contribute to disease worsening. Our findings demon-
strate elevated MIF and D-DT levels in males with progressive dis-
ease compared with relapsing-remitting males (RRMS) and female
MS subjects, with increased levels of CD74 in females vs. males with
high MS disease severity. Furthermore, increased MIF and D-DT lev-
els in males with progressive disease were significantly correlated
with the presence of two high-expression promoter polymorphisms
located in the MIF gene, a −794CATT5–8 microsatellite repeat and
a −173 G/C SNP. Conversely, mice lacking MIF or D-DT developed
less-severe signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a
murine model of MS, thus implicating both homologs as copatho-
genic contributors. These findings indicate that genetically con-
trolled high MIF expression (and D-DT) promotes MS progression
in males, suggesting that these two factors are sex-specific disease
modifiers and raising the possibility that aggressive anti-MIF treat-
ment of clinically isolated syndrome or RRMS males with a high-
expresser genotype might slow or prevent the onset of progressive
MS. Additionally, selective targeting of MIF:CD74 signaling might
provide an effective, trackable therapeutic approach for MS subjects
of both sexes.
multiple sclerosis | disease modifier | sex differences
M
ultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated de-
myelinating disease of the CNS (1–3). MS is categorized into
subtypes according to its clinical course. Most patients diagnosed
with MS begin with a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS). How-
ever, 10–15 y after disease onset, more than half of RRMS patients
develop secondary progressive MS (SPMS). MS patients not ini-
tially diagnosed with RRMS have primary progressive MS (PPMS)
in which there is gradual progression of impairment and disability
from disease onset without an initial relapsing-remitting phase.
Furthermore, while MS is two to three times more common in
women than men, this ratio decreases with older age and there is
an equal sex ratio among PPMS patients (4–6).
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an immu-
noregulatory cytokine that is secreted from various cell types in
different tissues (7–13). It was suggested that during neuro-
inflammation, macrophages and microglia are a major source of
MIF in the CNS (14). Niino et al. (15) demonstrated that the
concentration of MIF in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS subjects
was significantly elevated during disease relapse compared with
healthy control subjects. In the experimental autoimmune en-
cephalomyelitis (EAE) model, MIF was found to support EAE
progression through its ability to activate and recruit CNS
macrophages and microglia, which could impact CNS repair
mechanisms during chronic EAE (16).
MIF expression is regulated by both genetic and epigenetic
factors, such as posttranscriptional modification by histone
deacetylases (17) and transcription factors such as ICBP90 (18).
As for the genetic regulation of MIF expression, there are two
functional polymorphisms located in the MIF gene: alleles of
the −794 CATT5–8 microsatellite repeat and the −173 G/C SNP
have been reported to modulate MIF promoter activity and to
correlate with MIF expression levels. MIF promoter activity is
proportional to increased numbers of the CATT repeats at po-
sition −794, whereas the −173 C allele may be associated with
increased MIF promoter activity by its linkage disequilibrium
with the high-expression −794 CATT7 variant (19).
CD74 (HLA-class II invariant chain) is a type II transmembrane
glycoprotein containing a trimerization domain flanked by two
highly unstructured regions (20). In addition to its role as a
chaperone for MHC class II proteins, 2–5% of cellular CD74 is
expressed on the cell surface independently of MHC class II (21).
Significance
The biological processes that are involved in the progression
of multiple sclerosis (MS) are far from complete. Macro-
phage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its homolog,
D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT), are immunoregulatory cy-
tokines known to be involved in the worsening of various
autoimmune disorders. We demonstrate that genetically con-
trolled high MIF expression (and D-DT) promotes MS progres-
sion in males, suggesting that these two factors are sex-specific
disease modifiers. In addition, we show that MIF or D-DT de-
ficiency ameliorates the disease severity of the murine model
of MS. Our data suggest that targeting CD74, the common re-
ceptor for MIF and D-DT, with therapies such as partial MHC
class II constructs could be therapeutically beneficial for inhib-
iting MS clinical progression in selected patients.

 CD74, in combination with CD44, CXCR2, or CXCR4, trans-
duces MIF signaling (13, 22, 23), thus indicating an additional role
in immune cell stimulation (23). We recently demonstrated en-
hanced CD74 cell surface expression on monocytes in mice with
EAE, suggesting its involvement in disease course (24).
Recently, a second ligand for CD74 that is an ancestral ho-
molog of MIF, called D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT, also
known as MIF-2) was identified and reported (25–27). D-DT has
similar properties and functions as MIF (26). Like MIF, D-DT
has a vestigial enzymatic activity and catalyzes a similar reaction with
model nonnaturally occurring substrates, such as D-dopachrome
(28, 29). The human D-DT protein has only 35% identity with
MIF [27% in mice (27)] and both proteins are expressed at
equivalent levels in most tissues, with one report suggesting
higher expression in the murine brain (30). However, the role
of D-DT in MS and EAE has not yet been studied.
In the current study, we performed a comprehensive evalua-
tion of the involvement of MIF, D-DT, and CD74 in MS by
evaluating MIF and D-DT plasma levels, gene-expression levels,
and frequencies of functional MIF promoter variants. In addi-
tion, we determined CD74 expression levels on CD11b+ cells
and CD74 gene-expression levels in peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMC) and brains of MS subjects and healthy
controls (HC). Furthermore, we demonstrate the independent
roles of MIF and D-DT as copathogenic factors in EAE.
Results
Patient Demographics. Demographic data of the study participants
and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. There was no
statistical difference in the mean age between the HC, clinically
isolated syndrome (CIS), and RRMS subjects, but the mean ages
of these groups were expectedly significantly lower when com-
pared with the SPMS and PPMS subjects (P < 0.0001), since the
onset of progressive MS is usually at an older age. There was no
statistical difference in the mean age between males and females
in each of the different clinical groups. Also as expected, the
disease severity in CIS and RRMS subjects as measured by the
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) metric was significantly
lower compared with SPMS and PPMS subjects (P < 0.0001).
Disease severity did not differ between males and females with the
same disease type. The majority of RRMS and SPMS subjects
were treated with disease-modifying therapies (DMT), whereas
only about one-third of the PPMS were treated with DMT. In
addition, about 85% of the CIS subjects exhibited MRI abnor-
malities indicative of eventual development of MS.
MIF and D-DT Levels in MS Subjects. To date, only a few studies
have evaluated the involvement of MIF in MS (15, 31, 32).
Moreover, there are no available data about the role of the newly
discovered MIF homolog, D-DT, in MS or other autoimmune
diseases. We evaluated MIF and D-DT concentrations in the
plasma of HC and MS subjects. MIF was significantly higher in
the plasma of MS subjects compared with HC (P = 0.041) (Fig.
1A). Since MIF expression correlates with disease severity in
unrelated autoimmune diseases (33, 34), SPMS subjects were
grouped with PPMS subjects (e.g., progressive MS). Further
analysis according to gender and disease type demonstrated that
MIF plasma levels were significantly higher in male progressive
MS subjects compared with CIS (P = 0.004) or RRMS subjects
(P = 0.047), but only nominally higher compared with HC. MIF
plasma levels did not differ strongly among disease subtypes in
female MS subjects. In contrast, MIF plasma levels in male
progressive MS subjects were significantly higher compared with
female progressive MS subjects (mean of 56.1 ng/mL vs. 32.7 ng/mL,
respectively; P = 0.001) (Fig. 1B). Similarly, analysis of MIF
plasma levels of MS subjects according to their disease severity
(EDSS) revealed that MIF concentration in the plasma of male
MS subjects was significantly elevated in those with higher dis-
ease scores (P = 0.011), whereas for female MS subjects the
observed regression was consistent with no trend (P = 0.679).
Mean MIF concentrations across all disease severities in females
were similar to those of male MS subjects with low severity
(Fig. 1C).
D-DT levels were also somewhat elevated in MS subjects
compared with HC, but this difference did not reach significance
(Fig. 2A). Analysis of D-DT plasma levels according to sex did not
reveal strong differences among the different groups, although the
directions of the observed differences were similar to the MIF
results (Fig. 2B). However, just as we observed with MIF con-
centrations, analysis of D-DT plasma levels in MS subjects
according to their disease severity revealed that male MS subjects
with higher disease scores tended to have significantly higher
D-DT concentrations in plasma (P = 0.017), whereas female MS
subjects showed no significant trend (P = 0.642), remaining on
average at D-DT levels similar to those of males with low disease
severity (Fig. 2C).
Previously, it was demonstrated that MIF is highly expressed in
white matter brain tissues of MS subjects (16). We evaluated the
relative mRNA expression levels of MIF and D-DT in brain tis-
sues of two male and three female SPMS subjects. As demon-
strated in Fig. 3A, RNA was isolated from 30 mg (∼3 mm2) of
tissue from three representative white matter areas (for each brain
slice). Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of MIF
and D-DT was significantly higher in brains of male SPMS relative
to female SPMS subjects (P = 0.007 and P = 0.006, respectively).
Relative mRNA expression of MIF and D-DT levels in PBMC
did not statistically differ between any of the groups (Fig. S1). We
further demonstrated that MIF and D-DT mRNA expression

 levels in all of the samples were highly correlated with each other
(r2 = 0.732, P < 0.0001), whereas MIF and D-DT mRNA levels
were not as well correlated with CD74 expression levels (r2 = 0.03,
P = 0.02 and r2 = 0.01, P = 0.056, respectively) (Fig. 3B). Taken
together, our data suggest that expression of MIF vs. D-DT is
strongly correlated and that each factor correlates with MS disease
progression in male but not female subjects.
MIF Promoter Polymorphisms. The prevalence of the MIF −173 G/C
SNP and −794 CATT5–8 microsatellite polymorphisms was evalu-
ated in male and female HC and MS subjects. Since MIF poly-
morphisms show population stratification (11), the genetic analyses
were limited to samples from Caucasian patients. No deviation
from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was detected for the polymor-
phisms in the male or female control groups (CATT5–8 P = 0.149,
G/C P = 0.4386 and CATT5–8 P = 0.537, G/C P = 0.587, re-
spectively). Although we observed a small but significant difference
in MIF plasma levels between MS subjects compared with HCs, we
did not observe any significant association between high-expression
MIF genotypes in male and female MS subjects compared with sex-
matched HC subjects (Table 2 and Table S1). However, since MIF
was associated with EAE progression (16) and our data indicated
that MIF plasma levels were elevated in male MS subjects with
progressive disease, we evaluated MIF promoter polymorphisms
between male RRMS subjects with disease duration over 10 or 15 y
that are less likely to convert to progressive disease. As our original
sample of RRMS subjects with prolonged disease duration was
small, we genotyped and evaluated additional DNA samples of
Caucasian males with MS obtained from the University of Cal-
ifornia, San Francisco MS repository. Disease scores of the RRMS
subjects with prolonged disease duration were significantly lower
compared with progressive subjects (EDSS = 3.95 vs. EDSS = 6.04,
respectively; P < 0.0001). The frequencies of the −173 G/C SNP
and the −794 CATT5–8 genotypes are presented in Table 2. The
frequency of the −173 C-containing allele, which is in linkage
disequilibrium with the high-expression −794 CATT7 allele, was
significantly underrepresented in RRMS subjects with disease
duration of more than 10 or 15 y compared with progressive MS
subjects (21.6% or 20.5% vs. 31.9%, P = 0.029 and P = 0.034,
respectively). The frequency of the −794 CATT7 or the high-ex-
pression −794 CATT8-containing genotype alone also was lower in
RRMS subjects with long disease duration compared with pro-
gressive MS subjects (19.8% or 16.7% vs. 23.7%, P = 0.121 and
P = 0.247, respectively), but this difference was within statistical
error bounds, perhaps due to limitations in sample size. An anal-
ysis of inferred haplotypes showed that frequency of the combined
high-expression genotypes (−173 GC/CC and −794 CATT6X/7X)
was significantly lower in RRMS subjects with disease duration
of more than 10 or 15 y, compared with progressive MS sub-
jects, with odds ratios of 0.59 (P = 0.029) and 0.551 (P = 0.034),
respectively (Table 3).
Interestingly, the frequency of the high-expression GC/CC and
CATT6X/7X haplotypes was significantly lower in male RRMS
subjects with disease duration of over 10 y, compared with the
small sample size of female RRMS subjects with the same dis-
ease duration (21.6% vs. 44.0%, P = 0.04). Additionally, the
frequency of the high-expression MIF haplotypes was higher in
progressive male subjects compared with progressive female
subjects, but not significantly (31.9% vs. 24.3%, respectively,
P = 0.30). These results are consistent with the conclusion that
the predominant influence of high-expression MIF genotypes is
to affect disease progression in male MS subjects and not on
overall disease susceptibility. It is important to note that to date,
there are no available data on D-DT polymorphisms.

 CD74 Cell Surface Levels in MS Subjects and the Effects of Partial MHC
Class II Constructs. Previously we demonstrated that CD74 cell
surface expression on peripheral blood monocytes was up-
regulated during EAE and in a small cohort of MS subjects
compared with HC (24). To better evaluate CD74 cell surface
expression in human monocytes, PBMC were evaluated from
blood of a much larger cohort of HC and MS subjects. There was
no significant difference in CD74 expression levels between HC
and total MS subjects, or in MS males or MS females when
stratified according to gender or disease type (Fig. 4 A and B).
Evaluation of CD74 cell surface expression according to disease
severity of MS subjects also did not reveal any significant associ-
ation; rather, there was only a different trend line direction be-
tween males and females (Fig. 4C). However, females with high
disease severity (EDSS > 5.5) had significantly higher CD74 levels
than males with high disease severity (EDSS > 5.5; P = 0.046),
suggesting a sex-dependent difference in subjects with advanced
progressive MS. Relative CD74 mRNA expression levels in PBMC
did not differ statistically between any of the groups (Fig. S1).
Partial MHC class II constructs bind to CD74 and competitively
block MIF signal transduction, down-regulate CD74 cell surface
expression, and ameliorate EAE (24, 35, 36). As shown in Fig. 4D,
down-regulation of CD74 by the DRα1-human (h) MOG-35-
55 construct also was affected by sex, with greater suppression in
samples from males versus females (P = 0.026). Treating cells with
the DR2β1 domain (as a control) did not significantly reduce
CD74 surface expression on CD11b+ cells in either males or fe-
males. Notably, the DRα1–(h)MOG-35-55 construct competed
with both MIF and D-DT for binding to recombinant human
CD74. This competition showed steep concentration-dependence
and near-equivalence with respect to MIF versus its close homolog
D-DT (Fig. 4E). These data suggest that partial MHC class II
constructs are equally efficacious for inhibiting MIF vs. D-DT
interaction with their common receptor, CD74.
EAE in D-DT–KO and MIF-KO Mice. MIF-KO mice exhibit acute EAE
signs but no further progression of clinical disease, correlating with
the role of CNS infiltrating monocytes in disease progression
(16, 37, 38). However, the role of D-DT in EAE (or any other
autoimmune disease model) has not been reported previously. To
this end, we induced EAE in male and female C57BL/6 WT, MIF-
KO and D-DT–KO mice and evaluated the disease course. As
shown in Fig. 5, both male and female MIF-KO and D-DT–KO
mice exhibited a significantly less-severe disease course compared
with sex matched WT mice. Disease onset also was delayed in
male D-DT–KO mice compared with WT, as seen in the mean
daily scores for days 10–13 postimmunization (P = 0.003, P =
0.005, P = 0.007, and P = 0.006, respectively) and MIF-KO mice
for days 10–13 postimmunization (P = 0.008, P = 0.002, P = 0.001,
and P = 0.041). However, there was no difference in the cumu-
lative disease index between MIF-KO and D-DT–KO mice in
either sex. Both KO mice had significantly lower Cumulative
Disease Index (CDI) compared with sex-matched WT mice.
Immunophenotypic analysis of male D-DT–KO, MIF-KO, and
WT mice on day 18 postimmunization revealed that D-DT–KO
and MIF-KO mice had a significantly lower frequency of acti-
vated CD11b+CD45hi cells in spinal cords compared with WT

 mice (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.0002, respectively). In addition,
CD11b+ cells in spinal cords of D-DT–KO and MIF-KO mice
expressed lower levels of CD74 on their cell surface (P =
0.0006 and P = 0.03, respectively) (Fig. 6 A and B). Interestingly,
D-DT–KO and MIF-KO mice with EAE had significantly larger
spleens with increased numbers of splenocytes compared with
WT mice (P = 0.0084 and P = 0.0028, respectively) (Fig. 6C). In
addition, the frequencies of CD4+CD44hiCD69− cells (P = 0.029
and P = 0.002, respectively) and CD11b+CD74+ cells (P = 0.035
and P = 0.006, respectively) were significantly elevated in the
spleens of D-DT–KO and MIF-KO mice compared with WT
mice (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data suggest that D-DT,
like MIF, mediates EAE progression, and that D-DT absence is
associated with reduced migration of memory and activated
mononuclear cells from the periphery into the CNS.
Discussion
Most patients with MS are diagnosed initially with the relapsing-
remitting form of the disease before exhibiting continuous pro-
gressive disability over time (1–4, 39). Both inflammation and
neurodegeneration may contribute to disease progression, al-
though this process is still poorly understood. In the present
study, we demonstrated that MIF and D-DT, and their common
receptor CD74, affect disease severity and progression in a sex-
dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated the involvement
of D-DT in autoimmunity.
MIF was one of the first cytokines to be described and is a key
mediator of many autoimmune inflammatory diseases (8, 40). It
was suggested that MIF contributes to the pathogenesis of EAE/
MS by promoting leukocyte recruitment into the CNS, inhibiting
apoptosis of activated monocytes, and enhancing the secretion of
proinflammatory cytokines (16, 37, 41).
This comprehensive study evaluates functional MIF promoter
polymorphisms and MIF expression levels in MS. Three prior
studies evaluated MIF levels in the circulation or in active CNS
lesions in MS subjects (16, 31, 32). Hagman et al. (31) demon-
strated a positive correlation between MIF levels and EDSS
score of MS subjects. Furthermore, MIF levels were shown to be
increased in MS subjects with disability progression compared
with subjects with stable disease.
Our human genetic data suggest that high genotypic MIF ex-
pression acts not as a disease susceptibility factor but rather as a
disease modifier. Such a role for MIF was demonstrated pre-
viously in other autoimmune and inflammatory pathologies, in-
cluding rheumatoid arthritis (19, 33), systemic sclerosis (42),
systemic lupus erythematosus (34), and asthma (43). This obser-
vation is also in line with MIF’s well-characterized role as an
enhancer of inflammation in autoimmune diseases, although MIF
genotype-dependent disease susceptibility also has been reported
for several infectious diseases (44–47).
The analysis of MIF promoter polymorphisms in MS is consis-
tent with this notion, and high genotypic MIF expressing male
RRMS subjects may be more likely to convert to a progressive
disease form compared with male RRMS subjects that carry low
expression MIF genotypes. Although RRMS subjects with pro-
longed disease duration could still convert to SPMS, this usually

 occurs within 10–15 y from disease onset. We did observe that the
frequency of high-expressing MIF genotypes was slightly higher in
RRMS subjects with disease duration of 10 y compared with 15 y.
However, a larger study sample size would be needed to discern
differences in RRMS subjects with different disease durations. It
should be noted that two prior studies examined MIF polymor-
phisms in the Turkish population. One reported a protective role
of low −794 CATT repeats (e.g., CATT56) and a promotional role
of the −173 C, which is in linkage disequilibrium with the high-
expression −794 CATT7, while a second smaller study that fo-
cused only on the −173 G/C SNP found no associations (48, 49). It
is important to note that these studies focused mainly on RRMS
subjects and did not evaluate males and females separately. Most
of the RRMS subjects in our study were treated with DMT. While
it is possible that DMT might differentially affect MIF plasma
levels, our genetic findings, together with the gender differences in
MIF plasma levels that were observed, support a role for MIF as a
disease modifier. Concordance between MIF genotype and serum
levels has been observed in some studies (33, 34) but not others
(47). Generally, large and more clinically homogenous inflam-
matory syndromes have supported this relationship. However, we
must emphasize that the serum compartment is an imperfect
measure of MIF expression that may be genetically modulated at
the site of inflammation.
Our human data also demonstrate a strong correlation between
MIF and D-DT expression in plasma and CNS. Such correlation
was demonstrated previously in sepsis patients and healthy sub-
jects (50) in concert with MIF and D-DT cooperative regulation of
lung carcinoma cells (51). The two proteins share 34% amino acid
sequence identity and the common MIF superfamily protein fold
(27). D-DT binds to CD74 with high affinity (D-DT: KD = 5.42 ×
10−9 M vs. MIF: KD = 1.40 × 10−9 M) (27) and competes with MIF
for binding to the CD74 receptor. Like MIF, D-DT triggers the
CD74-dependent activation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase resulting in
similar downstream proinflammatory signaling. Modeling studies
predict three discrete binding regions between MIF or D-DT
homotrimers with the CD74 homotrimer. Topologically, how-
ever, the location of the three CD74 binding regions for the D-DT
homotrimer differs from that of the three MIF binding regions,
with only a single functional D-DT binding site available per CD74
trimer (52).
Partial MHC class II constructs were previously shown to bind
to CD74 through the DRα1 domain, block MIF binding, and
down-regulate CD74 expression (24, 35). Herein, we also dem-
onstrate that these constructs competitively inhibit D-DT binding
to CD74. We also observed that the DRα1–MOG-35-55 construct
induced a greater reduction of CD74 expression on CD11b+ cells
from male subjects compared with female subjects. Recently, we
reported that effective treatment of chronic EAE in female mice
with the DRα1–MOG-35-55 construct required higher doses
compared with male mice. This effect was dependent upon es-
trogen signaling, through estrogen receptor (ER)α (53). Thus, it is
possible that the sex differences that were observed in this study
were affected by estrogen.
Whitacre and colleagues (37) were the first to describe reduced
EAE progression in MIF-KO mice. Similar to MIF-KO mice,
D-DT–KO mice developed acute EAE but showed less-severe
disease progression compared with WT mice; the D-DT–KO
mice also demonstrated delayed onset of disease compared with
MIF-KO mice. This suggests that MIF and D-DT do not have
entirely redundant effects in EAE, but that both of these factors
contribute to disease progression. Our analyses also indicate that
mice lacking D-DT had reduced migration of inflammatory cells
into the CNS, but increased frequencies of activated monocytes
and memory T cells in spleen, due perhaps to residual MIF-
dependent inflammatory responses. Residual D-DT activity
likely accounts for a similar pattern of responses as that observed
in MIF-KO mice (16). To this point, Honigman et al. (30) dem-
onstrated that D-DT, like MIF, is widely expressed in the brain
parenchyma of adult mice (54). Taken together with our obser-
vation that both MIF and D-DT are expressed in white matter
tissue of SPMS subjects, these findings indicate that like MIF,
D-DT has a neuroinflammatory role and similarly affects cell
migration. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to more
precisely clarify the roles of MIF and D-DT in MS, especially with
respect to the mechanistic role of their common receptor CD74
and that of the noncognate chemokine receptors CXCR2 and
CXCR4 (9). Furthermore, it would be interesting to evaluate
whether increased MIF and D-DT levels in MS might promote the
activation of Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes similar to their ef-
fects described in parasite infections (55).
In conclusion, the combination of human genetic data and
mouse modeling strongly implicate MIF and D-DT as disease
modifiers in MS. High genotypic MIF expression likely underlies
the elevated levels of MIF and additional downstream proin-
flammatory factors that enhance disease progression. These
findings suggest that the MIF signaling pathway is a sex-specific,
MS disease modifier, raising the possibility that pharmacologic
MIF antagonism of CIS or RRMS males with a high MIF ex-
presser genotype might slow or prevent development of pro-
gressive MS. Additionally, targeting CD74 signaling potentially
could provide an effective, trackable therapeutic approach for
MS subjects of both sexes. Thus, the coordinate targeting of MIF
and D-DT with therapies such as partial MHC class II constructs
could be therapeutically beneficial for inhibiting MS clinical
progression in selected patients.

 Patients and Methods
Study Participants. One-hundred seventeen participants (>18 y) were recruited
at the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) MS Center. One-hundred
seventy plasma and 474 DNA samples of MS subjects were also received from
the University of California, San Francisco MS repository. Participants included
subjects with clinically definite or laboratory-supported MS diagnosis accord-
ing to Poser and MacDonald criteria, as well as subjects with CIS. Forty-nine HC
were enrolled at OHSU. Exclusion criteria for controls included MS in family
members or the presence of any autoimmune or chronic inflammatory con-
dition. Participant ethnicity was determined by self-reporting. Over 90% of the
study participants were of European ancestry.
Analysis of Plasma MIF and D-DT Levels by ELISA. Plasma MIF concentration
was measured by the human MIF Quantikine ELISA kit (#DMF00B; R&D
Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma D-DT con-
centration was measured by ELISA, as reported previously (27).
Human Brain Tissue. Frozen sections of five human CNS tissue specimens were
obtained from the Rocky Mountain MS Center Tissue Bank. Postmortem
intervals were between 7 and 42 h. Female subjects were 63, 64, and 68 y old
and male subjects were 61 and 62 y old. All subjects were diagnosed
with SPMS.
Real-Time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from CNS tissue or PBMC using
an RNeasy cultured cell kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Qiagen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the StepOne Plus
system with gene-on-demand assay products (Applied Biosystems) for TaqMan
array mouse immune response or for CD74 (Assay ID: Hs00269961_m1), MIF
(Assay ID: Hs00236988_g1), and D-DT (Assay ID: Hs00758115_m1). HPRT1
(Assay ID: Hs02800695_m1) and IPO8 (Assay ID: Hs00914057_M1) house-
keeping genes were amplified as endogenous controls. Primers were used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
MIF-173G/C Genotyping. DNA was isolated from whole blood using a Blood &
Cell Culture DNA Midi Kit (#13343; Qiagen). A 366-bp fragment of DNA
containing the MIF −173 polymorphism (rs755622) was amplified using 200 ng
of DNA, 0.5 mM of primers, and REDExtract-N-Amp PCR Ready Mix (#R4775;
Sigma Aldrich). The PCR product was digested overnight using 0.4 units/μL of
Alu I Restriction Enzyme (#R0137S; New England BioLabs) at 37 °C. The
digested products were separated on a 3% agarose gel. The G allele contains
one Alu restriction site and was cut into two fragments resulting in a 98- and a
268-bp band, while the C allele contains two Alu restriction sites and was cut
into three fragments, resulting in 205-, 98-, and 63-bp bands.

The

−794
CATT5–8
microsatellite
(rs5844572) was analyzed following the methodology described by Sreih
et al. (34). [We note that neither the microsatellite repeat nor the nearby −
173 G/C SNP is represented within the high-density genotyping chips used
previously for genome-wide association studies in GPA (56, 57)]. Briefly,
MIF −794 CATT5–8 genotyping was carried out by PCR using a forward primer
(5′-TGCAGGAACCAATACCCATAGG-3′) and a TET fluorescent reverse primer
(TET lab5′-AATGGTAAACTCGGGGGAC-3′). The quality of the PCR product was
assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Automated capillary electrophoresis on
a DNA sequencer was performed on each sample and the −794 CATT5–8 repeat
length was identified using Genotyper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems). Al-
though at least eight additional polymorphisms have been identified within the
human MIF locus, these additional variants (all SNPs) are rare and have a low
likelihood of functionality given their location in introns or within the 3′UTR (47).
Cell Surface CD74 Measurements. PBMC from MS and HC subjects were isolated
from whole blood using a Ficoll gradient and stored in liquid nitrogen.
CD74 expression was measured using four-color flow cytometry. Frozen PBMC
were thawed in 5% Stim Medium (RPMI 1640 media, 5% FBS, 2 mL 100× glycine,
and 2 mL pyruvate) and suspended in Staining Solution (1× PBS and 5% BSA).
Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated CD74 (Clone: MB731; BD), APC con-
jugated CD11b (clone: ICRF44; BioLegend), and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD;
BD). Data were collected and analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD).
CD74 Down-Regulation Assay. PBMCs were incubated in 5% Stim Media with
25 μg/mL DRα1-hMOG35-55, or DR2β1 proteins for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were
stained with APC-conjugated CD11b (clone:ICRF44; BioLegend) and PE-
conjugated CD74 (Clone: LN-2; Santa Cruz) and 7-AAD (BD). Data were
collected and analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD).
Competition Assay. ELISA plates were coated with rhMIF or rhD-DT overnight
at 4 °C and washed. After extensive washing, recombinant human (rh)CD74
(produced in our laboratory) at a constant concentration was combined
with serially diluted DRα1–hMOG-35-55 concentrations in the competi-
tive mixture and added to the wells for binding to coated rhMIF or hD-DT
onto ELISA plate wells. Briefly, the production of the rhCD74 was built by using
the N terminus and transmembrane domain of the mouse CD74 linked to the
135 residue extracellular domain of the human homolog encompassing resi-
dues 56 through 191. In addition, to produce a nondisulfide-linked poly-
peptide, the C residue at position 27 was substituted for an S residue. The
recombinant protein was purified using standard purification protocols and
tested with several monoclonal antibodies known to cross react with the wild-
type human version. After binding, plates were washed again and bound
rhCD74 was evaluated using a specific monoclonal anti-human CD74 antibody
(PIN1). The reaction was allowed to initiate by adding the HRP substrate and
stopped with 0.1 N HCl. The plate was read at 450 nm and the absorbance was
plotted versus DRα1–hMOG-35-55 concentration. Curves were produced and
analyzed using Prism and adjusted to a nonlinear regression for competitive

 binding with the same program. Each point was performed by triplicate and
the mean and SD were considered in the analysis.
Mice. C57BL/6 WT males and females were purchased from the Jackson
Laboratory. MIF and D-DT–KO mice (C57BL/6) were produced at Yale (58, 59)
and bred in-house at the Veterinary Medical Unit, VA Portland Health Care
System. All mice were used at 8–12 wk of age.
Induction of EAE. Male and female mice between 8 and 12 wk of age were
immunized subcutaneously at four sites on the flanks with 0.2 mL of an emulsion
of 200 μg mouse (m) MOG-35-55 peptide and complete Freund’s adjuvant
containing 200 μg of heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37RA (Difco)
(60). In addition, mice were given Pertussis toxin (Ptx) from List Biological
Laboratories on days 0 and 2 postimmunization (75 and 200 ng per mouse,
respectively). Immunized mice were scored (not blindly) for clinical signs of EAE
graded on a six-point scale of combined hindlimb and forelimb paralysis scores
(60). For hindlimb scores: 0 = no signs; 0.5 = limp tail or mild hindlimb weakness
(i.e., the mouse cannot resist inversion after a 90° turn of the base of the tail);
1 = limp tail and mild hindlimb weakness; 2 = limp tail and moderate hindlimb
weakness (an inability of the mouse to rapidly right itself after inversion); 3 =
limp tail and moderately severe hindlimb weakness (inability of the mouse to
right itself after inversion and clear tilting of hind quarters to either side while
walking); 4 = limp tail and severe hindlimb weakness (hind feet can move but
drag more frequently than face forward); 5 = limp tail and paraplegia (no
movement of hindlimbs). Front limb paralysis scores are either 0.5 for clear
restriction of normal movement or 1 for complete forelimb paralysis. The
combined score is the sum of the hindlimb score and the forelimb score. Rarely,
there is mortality of mice with severe EAE, and in these cases mice are scored as
a 6 for the remainder of the experiment. Mean EAE scores and SDs for mouse
groups were calculated for each day from day 8 through day 27 post-
immunization and summed for each mouse by numerically integrating the EAE
score curve over the entire experiment (CDI, represents total disease load). A
power analysis indicates that groups of at least six mice are sufficient to detect
a difference of 2.0 EAE units with an SD of 1.0 and a power of 0.88.
Flow Cytometry. Four-color [FITC, phycoerythrin, (PE), 7-AAD, and allophyco-
cyanin, (APC)] fluorescence flow cytometry analyses were performed to de-
termine the phenotypes of cells following standard antibody staining
procedures. Tissues were harvested from random mice in each group. For
splenocytes, single-cell suspensions of spleens were prepared by homogenizing
the tissue through a fine mesh screen. Cells were pelleted after lysis of red cells
followed by washing twice with RPMI. Mononuclear cells from the spinal cord
were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation as previously described (61). Cells
from spleen or spinal cord were resuspended in staining medium (5% BSA, 1×
PBS and 0.02% sodium azide) for FACS staining. Fc receptors were blocked with
mouse Fc receptor-specific mAb (2.3G2; BD Pharmingen) before cell-surface
staining. Data were collected and analyzed with Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences). All
antibodies were purchased from BD PharMingen or eBioscience unless other-
wise indicated. Cells were stained with a combination of fluorescent labeled
antibodies to CD11b (clone: M1/70), CD74 (clone: ln1), CD45 (clone: 30-F11), CD4
(clone: GK1.5), CD44 (clone: IM7), CD69 (clone: HI.2F3).
Statistics. Cohort data were reported using GraphPad Prism (v5.0) and
expressed as the mean ± SD or percentage frequencies, and group compari-
sons were assessed by one-way ANOVA or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
Sample size was supported by power analysis based on preliminary pilot data
showing an effect size of approximately Cohen’s W = 0.22 (62) on the asso-
ciation of genotype to MS disease type in males; with this sample size we
anticipated power in excess of 95% to observe a similar effect in the current
cohort. Evaluation of gender differences in linear trend of MIF and D-DT
concentrations over increasing MS disease severity (as measured by the
EDSS) was assessed by tests of the relevant interaction coefficients in ordinary
linear regressions.
For MIF polymorphisms, Pearson’s χ2 test was used to analyze Hardy–
Weinberg equilibrium. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared
using Fisher’s exact test.
For nonparametric comparison between WT C57BL/6, MIF-KO, and D-DT–KO
mice in the EAE experiments, daily EAE response values for each mouse were
organized into a time curve for the mouse’s follow-up and preprocessed using
the discrete Fourier transform to decorrelate the values obtained on successive
days; the sets of curves for each group of mice were then averaged in the fre-
quency domain, and the group mean curves compared using Fan and Lin’s
adaptive Neyman test (63). Mean CDIs were compared between pairs of
groups using Welch’s one-sided t test after augmenting the within-group
variances to include the CDI estimation error (64). Tests with P ≤ 0.05 were
considered significant.
