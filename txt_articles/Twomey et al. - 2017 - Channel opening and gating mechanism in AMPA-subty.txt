Summary
AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission 
throughout the central nervous system. Gated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, AMPA receptors 
are critical for synaptic strength and dysregulation of AMPA receptor-mediated signaling is linked 
to numerous neurological diseases. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structures 
of AMPA receptor-auxiliary subunit complexes in the apo, antagonist and agonist-bound states and 
elucidate the iris-like mechanism of ion channel opening. The ion channel selectivity filter is 
formed by the extended portions of the re-entrant M2 loops, while the helical portions of M2 
contribute to extensive hydrophobic interfaces between AMPA receptor subunits in the ion 
channel. We show how the permeation pathway changes upon channel opening and identify 
conformational changes throughout the entire AMPA receptor that accompany activation and 
desensitization. Our findings provide a framework for understanding gating across the family of 
ionotropic glutamate receptors and the role of AMPA receptors in excitatory neurotransmission.

 Excitatory neurotransmission is tightly governed by the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazolepropionic (AMPA) subtype of the ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs)1,2. 
Gated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, AMPA receptors (AMPARs) activate on a sub-
millisecond timescale and rapidly depolarize the post-synaptic membrane. AMPAR-
mediated neuronal signaling has profound effects on synaptic strength, and many 
neurological diseases have been directly linked to changes in AMPAR synaptic signaling3–5.
AMPARs are tetrameric, two-fold symmetric membrane proteins with a three-layer, “Y”-
shaped architecture6,7. Extracellularly, the amino-terminal domains (ATDs) form the top of 
the “Y.” Below the ATDs are the ligand binding domains (LBDs) that bind the 
neurotransmitter glutamate. Two polypeptide stretches (S1 and S2) make up each of the four 
AMPAR subunit LBDs, which are tethered to the transmembrane domain (TMD) at the base 
of the “Y” by flexible linkers. The nearly four-fold symmetric TMD is made up of three 
membrane-spanning helices (M1, M3 and M4) and a re-entrant pore loop (M2) between 
helices M1 and M3. The cation-selective ion channel is lined by the M3 helices with their 
bundle crossing forming a tight gate to regulate permeation.
Since the first, closed-state intact AMPAR structure8, many studies have pursued different 
receptor conformations using both X-ray crystallography9–12 and cryo-electron microscopy 
(cryo-EM)13–17. However, the structure of the ion channel is yet to be resolved to high-
resolution, and the open-state of the receptor has yet to be seen. This is a fundamental 
barrier to understanding AMPAR biology and structurally-informed design of therapeutics 
targeting AMPARs in neuropathological conditions. Here, we use cryo-EM to solve the 
structure of an AMPAR ion channel to high resolution and resolve opening of the AMPAR 
ion channel in response to binding of glutamate.
Ion Channel Structure
We used cryo-EM to analyze the structure of the homomeric GluA2 flip splice variant 
AMPAR in complex with the auxiliary subunit germline-specific gene 1-like (GSG1L), 
which we surmised would stabilize the closed-state structure of the ion channel as it lowers 
the ion channel open probability compared to the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein 
(TARP)-γ2 or stargazin (STZ)15,16. Indeed, using a covalent fusion construct (Methods) 
between truncated forms of GluA2 and GSG1L, we solved structures of the digitonin-
solubilized receptor complex bound to the antagonist ZK200775 (ZK) in two states, termed 
GluA2-GSG1LZK-1 (4.6 Å) and GluA2-GSG1LZK-2 (4.4 Å) (Extended Data Table 1; 
Extended Data Fig. 1), with local qualities of the maps showing higher resolution details in 
the ion channel pore (Extended Data Fig. 2).
The GluA2-GSG1LZK-1 complex has a typical Y-shaped GluA2 tetramer in the center (Fig. 
1a), with two GSG1L subunits assembling between protomers A/B and C/D on the periphery 
of the GluA2 TMD (Fig. 1b). The GluA2 TMD is completely resolved and allows building 
of the entire ion channel pore-forming region (Fig. 1c–d). The M3 bundle crossing, formed 
by T617, A621, T625 and M629, occludes cation permeation, as previously observed in the 
original GluA2 crystal structure8. Below T617, the M3 bundle crossing opens up into a 
hydrophobic cavity in the middle of the channel pore. Below this cavity is a second

 constriction formed by the extended regions of the M2 re-entrant loops. Similar to other 
tetrameric ion channels, this constriction might serve as a lower gate of the channel as well 
as a selectivity filter18–20. At the re-entrant loop tip, the Q/R-site glutamines (Q586) 
protrude towards the center of the ion channel pore, occluding the permeation pathway and 
forming a lower gate. Their location is consistent with the observation that channels 
composed of edited GluA2 subunits (Q586R) have reduced Ca2+ permeation and polyamine 
block, likely due to electrostatic repulsion21,22. The pore loop, under the Q/R-site, appears to 
be more flexible in our closed-state structures, compared to the rest of the channel, but we 
expect it to become more ordered upon channel opening to form a selectivity filter along the 
permeation pathway.
The α-helical portion of M2 is largely hydrophobic (Fig. 1c) and contributes to cross-
subunit interfaces within the TMD (Extended Data Fig. 3b). These hydrophobic interactions 
involve L540 and Y533 from M1, as well as W605 and F608 from the neighboring M3, each 
from the same subunit as the M2, and W606 and I600 from M3 of the adjacent subunit. The 
M2 helix contributes to these hydrophobic interfaces through L577, W578, L581 and F584. 
For a helix that has often evaded structural studies, the M2 helix has quite an extensive 
network of hydrophobic interactions.
The second closed state structure, GluA2-GSG1LZK-2, has the same ion channel architecture 
as in GluA2-GSG1LZK-1, though with higher resolution details throughout the TMD 
(Extended Data Fig. 2). While the TMD structure is the same, the ECD in GluA2-
GSG1LZK-2 is astonishingly different, being shorter by 6 Å (Extended Data Fig. 4). The 
ATD rotates 19° as a rigid body around the overall two-fold axis of symmetry (Extended 
Data Fig. 4c–d), and the LBD dimers rotate by 4°, creating a separation between the 
proximal subunits A and C (Extended Data Fig. 4e–f). An elongated density at the ATD-
LBD interfaces inside subunits A and C perfectly matches a digitonin molecule (Extended 
Data Fig. 4b, inset). Thus, digitonin binding might help to trap GluA2 in a distinct closed 
state conformation. We hypothesize that the ATD-LBD interface represents a novel binding 
site for hydrophobic molecules with a possible therapeutic significance and may bind fatty 
acids that have recently been identified as novel AMPAR noncompetitive inhibitors23,24.
Cryo-EM of activated GluA2-STZ complex
To understand how the native neurotransmitter glutamate (Glu) activates and opens the 
AMPAR ion channel, we used a fusion construct between GluA2 and STZ (Methods) that 
promotes GluA2-STZ complex formation and expression while maintaining its functional 
properties. In contrast to GSG1L, which stabilizes the AMPAR inactive states, STZ favors 
the open state25–27, as signified by increased steady-state current in response to Glu 
application in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (Fig. 2a). Additional stabilization of the 
open state is provided by the positive allosteric modulator cyclothiazide (CTZ)28, which 
makes AMPAR responses non-desensitizing (Fig. 2a).
We solved a cryo-EM structure of the GluA2-STZ complex in the presence of Glu and CTZ 
to 4.2 Å resolution (Extended Data Fig. 1), with two-dimensional class averages showing the 
secondary structure features and diverse orientations (Fig. 2b). The reconstruction (Fig. 2c)

 shows the entire GluA2-STZ complex in the agonist-bound state, with high-resolution 
features in the GluA2 TMD core (Extended Data Figs 2n and 2o) but lower local resolution 
for STZ. To achieve unambiguous side chain definition in the TMD, we performed directed 
refinement (Fig. 2c) that resulted in a 4.0 Å cryo-EM reconstruction (Fig. 2d) and distinct 
side chain densities (Extended Data Fig. 5e). The TMD cryo-EM map shows clear 
differences in the central pore (Fig. 2e) compared to the closed-state GluA2-GSG1L 
complex (Fig. 1b) and four STZ molecules bound. Also, glutamate and CTZ are easily 
discernible in the cryo-EM density (Extended Data Figs 5a and 5d), suggesting that we 
trapped the complex in an activated state.
The original, closed-state cryo-EM structures of the GluA2-STZ complex suggested that 
acidic residues in the STZ β4-TM2 loop mediate electrostatic interactions with positively 
charged residues in the lower GluA2 LBD and S1-pre-M1 linker to enhance receptor 
activation17,29. In our active state cryo-EM reconstruction, this region of STZ appears to be 
disordered. However, based on well-defined adjacent regions of STZ (Extended Data Fig. 
5e), the same acidic residues are juxtaposed to the GluA2 basic patch. Perhaps rather than 
directly interacting in the activated state, the β4-TM2 loop plays an important role in the 
structural transitions necessary for receptor activation.
Our density, and the corresponding GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ model (Fig. 3, Methods) show four 
STZ molecules bound around the AMPAR core (Fig. 2e, Extended Data 6c). We used the 
same fusion design to solve the first structure of the GluA2-STZ complex in the closed 
state15 but observed only one or two STZ molecules bound to the AMPAR core. Here we 
solubilized the complex in digitonin instead of dodecyl maltoside (DDM) detergent and 
observed maximum occupancy of STZ binding sites around the AMPAR core, similar to 
GluA2-STZ co-expression17. Accordingly, instead of the four-layer particle architecture in 
DDM15, we now see a clearly discernible three-layer architecture in the two-dimensional 
(2D) class averages (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Interestingly, the GluA2-GSG1L complex in 
digitonin, which showed a four-layer architecture when solubilized in DDM16, also showed 
the three-layer particle architecture (Extended Data Fig. 6b) but with only two, not four, 
molecules of GSG1L bound to GluA2 core (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 6d). As the nature 
of the fusion construct design does not preclude full occupancy of the auxiliary subunit 
binding sites, we hypothesize that STZ and GSG1L use different stoichiometries to assemble 
with AMPARs.
Open ion channel pore
As indicated by the markedly different architecture of the AMPAR core in GluA2-
STZGlu+CTZ compared to the closed state, the width of the TMD increases by 10 Å from 55 
Å in the closed state structures to 65 Å in GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ, and the ion channel pore 
undergoes widening (cf. Figs. 1b and 3b). We probed the ion conduction pathway in GluA2-
STZGlu+CTZ (Fig. 4a) and found it much wider than in the closed state GluA2-GSG1L 
structures (Fig. 1d). Measurements of the pore radius (Fig. 4b) confirmed that in contrast to 
the pore-occluded conformations in the closed GluA2-GSG1LZK-1, GluA2-GSG1LZK-2 and 
desensitized GluA2-GSG1LQuis16 states, the GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ pore is wide open for ion 
conductance. The distances between Cα’s of diagonal Q586, T617 and A621 pairs increased

 almost uniformly by about 3 Å in GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ (Fig. 4b–c) signifying nearly 4-fold 
symmetric, iris-type opening of the main portion of the pore (Fig. 4d), reminiscent of other 
tetrameric ion channels19,30,31. In stark contrast, the distance between diagonal T625 pairs, 
which is similar for the A/C and B/D subunit pairs in the closed state (9.5 and 11 Å), 
increases to 16 Å for the A/C pair and to 32 Å for the B/D pair in GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ. This 
6.5 Å versus 21 Å separation upon channel opening indicates that at the level of T625, the 
AMPAR pore loses its pseudo 4-fold symmetry and becomes two-fold symmetric, consistent 
with previous functional experiments32. We also compared our recent molecular dynamics 
(MD) model of the open state33 and the GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ structure. The narrowest 
portions of the pore in the MD model, estimated as Cα distances between the diagonal Q586 
(9.6 Å) and T617 (12.6 Å) pairs, are narrower than the corresponding portions of the GluA2-
STZGlu+CTZ pore (10.2 Å and 14.1 Å, respectively). Yet, we clearly observed ion conducting 
events through our MD model33, an observation strongly supporting the conducting 
conformation of the GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ pore. In addition, a clear density in the center of the 
pore (Extended Data Figs 5b and 5c), likely representing a sodium ion, also suggests that the 
selectivity filter of the channel is indeed in a conducting state.
The selectivity filter located at and below the Q/R site (Fig. 4a–b), which is not visible in the 
closed-state, is clearly resolved in GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ and is approximately four-fold 
symmetric, similar to K+ channels30,31. Just below the Q/R site, the backbone carbonyls of 
Q587, G588 and C589 line the selectivity filter, while the side chains of Q587 and C589 
point away from the central pore axis. At the bottom of the selectivity filter is D590 that 
creates a negative entry point into the cytoplasm from the channel pore, perhaps playing a 
role in cation versus anion selectivity of AMPAR channels.
Gating Mechanism
In order to understand the conformational changes that are associated with AMPAR gating 
we compared the open-state GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ to the closed-state GluA2-GSG1LZK-1 and 
the desensitized-state GluA2-2xGSG1LQuis structures (Fig. 5, Video S1). Since gating starts 
with binding of glutamate to an unliganded AMPAR, we first wanted to see if GluA2-
GSG1LZK-1 faithfully represents the resting, apo state of the receptor. We solved cryo-EM 
structures of the digitonin-solubilized GluA2-GSG1L complex in the absence of ligands, 
which, similarly to the ZK-bound structures, are represented by two different states. The apo 
state structures, GluA2-GSG1Lapo-1 and GluA2-GSG1Lapo-2, turned out to be very similar 
to GluA2-GSG1LZK-1 and GluA2-GSG1LZK-2 (Extended Data Figs 3 and 4), superposing 
on each other with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.526 Å and 0.701 Å, 
respectively. We therefore used the higher resolution GluA2-GSG1LZK-1 structure that is 
nearly identical to GluA2-GSG1Lapo-1 as a faithful representation of the closed resting state.
In the first approximation, activation, which includes ion channel opening, is represented by 
the GluA2-GSG1LZK-1 to GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ transition. At the level of a single LBD, 
glutamate binding causes 26˚ LBD clamshell closure (Fig. 5a–d). Consistent with studies on 
isolated LBDs34–36, this closure leaves the D1-D1 interface intact and leads to a 12 Å 
separation of the D2 lobes (Fig. 5e). The D2 separation results in widening of the LBD 
tetramer and expansion of the LBD gating ring in the middle of the LBD layer (Fig. 5g–h

 and Extended Data Fig. 7g–h), which translates to pore opening by the LBD-TMD linkers 
(Fig. 5j–k).
We monitored conformational rearrangements in the S1-M1, M3-S2 and S2-M4 linkers by 
measuring distances between Cα’s of the diagonal K505, S635 and G771 pairs. The M3-S2 
linker in subunits B and D plays the central role in transmitting conformational changes in 
LBDs to opening of the ion channel, as signified by an 11 Å increase in S635 separation and 
a distinct kink in the M3 helix at A618 (Fig. 5j–k and Extended Data Fig. 5e), which turns 
the upper gate at the bundle crossing away from the central pore axis. The M3 helices in 
subunits A and C unwind and become one helical turn shorter, but the S635 separation in 
subunits A and C decreases by 1 Å, suggesting a weaker role in gating of the corresponding 
linkers. The S1-M1 linkers in subunits B and D make much more significant contribution to 
channel opening than the S1-M1 linkers in subunits A and C, with separation between K505 
increasing by 13 and 5 Å, respectively. Unexpected changes were observed in the S2-M4 
linkers in subunits A and C, which included complete unwinding of the pre-M4 helices (Fig. 
5j–k) and stretching these linkers towards the center of the ion channel pore, while reducing 
the distance between G771 by 5 Å. These changes are in stark contrast to the S2-M4 linkers 
in subunits B and D, which maintain their relative positioning. The unprecedented 
conformational changes in the subunits A/C S2-M4 linkers that occur during channel 
opening support the importance of the M4 segments for iGluR function37–39 and suggest a 
possible contribution of these linkers to the open pore extracellular vestibule.
We next mapped the changes between GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ and GluA2-2xGSG1LQuis16 to 
assess conformational rearrangements during desensitization. Upon desensitization, 
individual LBDs maintain their closed clamshell conformation (Fig. 5a–d), while the LBD 
dimers undergo drastic rearrangements (Fig. 5f), signified by rupture of the D1-D1 interface 
(reduction in the S741 distance by 9 Å) allowing D2 lobes to come closer together (by 15 Å, 
measured as a change in the S635 distance) and permit channel closure. Rupture of the D1-
D1 interface parallels loss of two-fold symmetry by individual LBD dimers, with 14˚ 
rotation of the A/C LBDs away from their B/D dimer partners and a more 4-fold symmetric 
LBD tetramer arrangement16 signified by appearance of a cleft between local LBD dimers 
(Fig. 5i). Correspondingly, the D2 attachments to the LBD-TMD linkers in this new LBD 
tetramer arrangement acquire positions similar to the closed state, compressing the expanded 
open-state LBD gating ring (Fig. 5g–i). This results in the LBD-TMD linkers (Fig. 5l) 
returning to positions (Fig. 5j) that confer a closed, non-conducting ion channel. To return 
back to the resting state, the receptor must undergo conformational rearrangement from the 
desensitized to the closed, resting state, in a process termed recovery from desensitization16.
The ATD local dimers maintain their relative positioning between different gating states, 
resulting in rigid-body movements of the ATD tetramer (Extended Data Fig. 7d–f). During 
opening, the ATD tetramer rotates by 11˚ clockwise as viewed extracellularly (Extended 
Data Fig. 7e). Upon desensitization, the ATD further rotates clockwise by an additional 7˚ 
(Extended Data Fig. 7f). To recover from desensitization back to the resting state, the ATD 
must then rotate counter-clockwise by 18˚. Maintenance of the ATD tetrameric arrangement 
in different gating states29,40 emphasizes importance of the ATDs for iGluR assembly41–45,

 while enormous rigid body rotations provide a way to fine tune synaptic transmission via 
altering cross-synaptic interactions46.
Discussion
The structures of AMPAR complexes allow better understanding of the iGluR gating 
mechanism (Extended Data Fig. 8). Channel opening in GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ is accompanied 
by the outward flipping of Q586, which occludes the channel in the closed state, away from 
the central pore axis. Therefore, the Q/R site at the tip of M2 seems to function as a lower 
gate. We propose that individual AMPAR subunit contributions to the lower gate result in the 
sub-conductance states observed in single-channel AMPAR studies47,48. AMPARs occupy 
their highest conductance state in the presence of glutamate49,50 and STZ26. We expect that 
the highest conductance state results from all subunits being engaged by glutamate51,52 
when channel occlusion is relieved at both gates. STZ similarly promotes the higher 
conductance states by stabilizing the open conformation of the lower gate through 
interaction with the M2 helices. We therefore believe that our GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ structure 
represents the maximum-conductance state of the channel.
In addition, the prominent placement of Q586 of the Q/R-site in the ion channel pore 
explains why AMPARs containing the R-edited GluA2 subunits show dramatically reduced 
ion channel conductance53, likely through adding a bulky, charged residue into the 
permeation pathway. At the level of glutamate receptors, this demonstrates how 
compartment-specific mRNA editing alters ion channel conductance and AMPAR-mediated 
excitatory neurotransmission2. Importantly, identification of the earlier-predicted32 M3 kink 
at A618 in subunits B/D upon channel opening suggests a wider role for A618 across gating 
in the iGluR family, as it is part of the highly-conserved SYTANLAAF motif20. Also in this 
motif is the Lurcher mutation A622T, which dramatically changes function across iGluR 
subtypes, resulting in constitutively-activated receptors and dramatically different gating 
properties54. The proximity of this site to A618 suggests that the Lurcher mutation may 
change iGluR gating through altering the properties of M3 kinking upon channel opening. 
Better understanding of AMPAR gating and availability of the high-resolution open-state 
structure will help overcome barriers in therapeutic design and treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases.
Methods
Construct
The fusion constructs used for cryo-EM were prepared by introducing a single GT linker 
between rat GluA2flip construct described in literature11 and mouse GSG1L truncated after 
F23716 or STZ truncated after L20715, in the pEG BacMam vector55, with a C-terminal 
eGFP for FSEC56 profiling and monitoring during expression, in addition to a streptavidin 
affinity tag for purification purposes. The amino acids T-G-G were included between the C-
terminus of GSG1L or STZ and a thrombin cleavage site (L-V-P-R-G-S) prior to the C-
terminal eGFP and affinity tag.

 Electrophysiology
DNA encoding wild type GluA2 or GluA2-STZ was introduced into a plasmid for 
expression in eukaryotic cells that was engineered to produce green fluorescent protein via a 
downstream internal ribosome entry site11. HEK293 cells (ATCC #CRL-1573) grown on 
glass cover slips in 35 mm dishes were transiently transfected with 1–5 μg of plasmid DNA 
using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). Recordings were made 24 to 96 hours after 
transfection at room temperature. Currents from whole cells, typically held at a −60 mV 
potential, were recorded using Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, LLC), filtered 
at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using low-noise data acquisition system Digidata 1440A 
and pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices, LLC). The external solution contained (in mM): 
140 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 4 CaCl2, 4 MgCl2, 10 HEPES pH 7.3 and 10 glucose; 7 mM NaCl was 
added to the extracellular activating solution containing 3 mM L-glutamate (Glu). The 
internal solution contained (in mM): 150 CsF, 10 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 20 HEPES pH 7.3. Rapid 
solution exchange was achieved with a two-barrel theta glass pipette controlled by a 
piezoelectric translator. Typical 10–90% rise times were 200–300 μs, as measured from 
junction potentials at the open tip of the patch pipette after recordings. Data analysis was 
performed using the computer program Origin 9.1.0 (OriginLab Corp.).
Expression and purification
The GluA2-GSG1L and GluA2-STZ bacmid and baculovirus were made using standard 
methods55, and the following methods were applied to the expression and purification of 
both constructs. P2 virus, produced from Sf9 cells (GIBCO #12659017), was added to 
HEK293S GnTI− cells (ATCC #CRL-3022) at 37 ˚C and 5% CO2. At 12 hours post-
infection, 10 mM sodium butyrate was added the temperature was changed to 30 ˚C. At 72 
hours post-infection, cells were collected by low-speed centrifugation (4,000 rpm, 15 
minutes). Cells were then washed with PBS pH 8.0 and pelleted with low speed 
centrifugation (4,000 rpm, 15 minutes). The washed cells were lysed with a Misonix 
sonicator (18 x 10s, power level 7) in a 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 
protease inhibitors (0.8 μM aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μM pepstatin A and 1 mM 
phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride) – 50 ml was used per 1 L HEK 293 cells. Following, the 
lysate was clarified after centrifugation (8,000 rpm, 15 minutes), and the membranes were 
collected by ultracentrifugation (40,000 rpm, 40 minutes). The membranes were collected 
and mechanically homogenized, then solubilized for two hours in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM 
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% digitonin (Cayman Chemical Company #14952). Insoluble material 
was removed by ultracentrifugation (40,000 rpm, 40 minutes). Streptavidin-linked resin was 
added to the soluble material (1 ml resin per 1 L cells), and left to bind for 10–14 hours. The 
resin was washed with 10 column volumes of 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% 
digitonin (0.05% digitonin was used in the GluA2-STZ purification). Elution was done with 
the same buffer but supplemented with 2.5 mM D-desthiobiotin. The sample was then 
concentrated and digested with thrombin (1:200 mass ratio of thrombin to eluted protein) for 
2 hours at 22 ˚C. The sample was then loaded onto a size-exclusion chromatography column 
(Superose-6) equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% digitonin 
(0.05% digitonin was used in the GluA2-STZ purification). The peak fractions were pooled 
for cryo-EM specimen preparation, and concentrated to 5 mg/ml (4 mg/ml for GluA2-STZ). 
All steps, unless otherwise noted, were performed at 4 ˚C.

 Cultured Cells Details
Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were used for patch-clamp 
electrophysiology. Cells were obtained from ATCC and were not further authenticated. Cells 
were grown and maintained using standard protocols at 37 C with 5% CO2, in DMEM 
media (Corning) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Crystalgen). 
Before recordings, cells were plated on glass coverslips in 35 mm dishes and transiently 
transfected with 1–5 mg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). 
Cells were passed twice a week and were used until the 30th passage.
HEK293S GnTI− cells were used to express protein for cryo-EM. Cells were obtained from 
ATCC and were not further authenticated. Cells were grown and maintained at 37 C and 5% 
CO2 using standard protocols, in Freestyle 293 media (GIBCO) supplemented with 2% heat 
inactivated fetal bovine serum (Crystalgen). Cells were passed twice a week and were used 
until the 30th passage.
Sf9 insect cells were used to make baculovirus for infecting HEK293S GnTI− cells. Cells 
were obtained from GIBCO and were not further authenticated. Cells were grown and 
maintained at 27 C using standard protocols, in Sf-900 III SFM (GIBCO). Cells were passed 
twice a week and were used until the 30th passage.
Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection
C-flat (Protochips, Inc., Morrisville, NC) CF-1.2/1.3-2Au 200 mesh holey carbon grids were 
coated with gold using an Edwards Auto 306 evaporator. Carbon was removed using Ar/O2 
(6 minutes, 50 watts, 35.0 sccm Ar, 11.5 sccm O2) plasma treatment with a Gatan 
(Pleasanton, CA, USA) Solarus 950 advanced plasma system, making Au 1.2/1.3 holey /on 
Au mesh grids57. In order to make the surface hydrophilic prior to sample application, the 
grid surface was plasma-treated with H2/O2 (20s, 10 watts, 6.4 sccm H2, 27.5 sccm O2). 
Frozen-hydrated grids were prepared using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). 
3 μl of sample (5 mg/ml GluA2-GSG1L with or without 0.3 mM antagonist ZK200775) was 
applied to the plasma-treated grids using 3.0 s blotting time, 3 blot force, 30.0 s wait time 
and 100% humidity at 22 ˚C. For the open state, 4 mg/ml GluA2-STZ was incubated for 15 
minutes with 100 μM CTZ, then 3 μl of this was quickly added and pipetted up-and-down in 
a mixture of 0.5 μl 700 mM glutamate (final concentration 100 mM). 3 μl of this mixture 
was added to the grid, blotted as described above.
The GluA2-GSG1L data (apo/ZK) were collected on a Tecnai F30 Polara (FEI) microscope 
operating at 300 kV, using Leginon58 with a Gatan K2 Summit electron detection (DED) 
camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA) in counting mode with a pixel size of 0.98 Å. Data 
were collected across 40 frames (0.2 s per frame), with a dose rate of 8 e− pixel−1 s−1 (total 
dose of ~67 e− Å−2), within defocus range −1.5 μm to −3.5 μm, Cs 2.26 mm. The GluA2-
STZ data were collected on a Titan Krios microscope (FEI) operating at 300 kV, using 
Leginon with a post-GIF quantum energy filter (20 eV slit) and Gatan K2 Summit direct 
camera DED camera in counting mode operating at a pixel size of 1.08 Å/pixel. A dose rate 
of 8 e− physical pixel−1 s−1 (total dose of ~55 e− Å2) was used across 40 frames (0.2 ms per 
frame), within the defocus range −1.0 μm to −3.0 μm.

 Image processing
All frame alignment and dose-weighting was carried out in MotionCor259. CTF correction, 
with gCTF60, was performed on non-dose-weighted micrographs, with all further processing 
on dose-weighted micrographs using RELION 2.061. From 2,938 micrographs for GluA2-
GSG1L bound to ZK, 541,261 particles were picked. The data was binned to 3.92 Å/pixel 
and subject to 2D classification, which resulted in cleaning the particle pool to 513,406 
particles. These particles were then subject to 3D classification without symmetry into ten 
classes and the GluA2-2xGSG1LZK model16 low-pass filtered to 40 Å as a reference. Three 
classes, with two showing different ECD conformations (i.e., state 1 and state 2) and two 
auxiliary subunits bound were chosen for additional 3D sub-classification. This resulted in a 
group of 234,426 particles, which were unbinned to a pixel size of 1.96, and subject to 
classification with the GluA2-2xGSG1LZK model (40 Å filter) as the reference. This 
resulted in two well-structured groups of particles: GluA2-GSG1LZK-1 (26,971 particles) 
and GluA2-GSG1LZK-2 (41,926 particles). The particles were unbinned to the original 0.98 
Å/pixel size, and refined with C2-symmetry. Of note is that we did not observe any 
stoichiometric heterogeneity, as was observed in cryo-EM performed on the GluA2-GSG1L 
complex solubilized in DDM16.
For the GluA2-GSG1L collection in the absence of ligand, 242,078 particles were 
automatically picked from 2,593 micrographs using six 2D classes as references (generated 
from manual picking as described above). The particle images were binned to 3.92 Å/pixel, 
and 235,543 particles remained following 2D classification. Following, 3D classification 
was carried out without symmetry into ten classes with the 40 Å low-pass filtered GluA2-
GSG1LZK-1 map. Six classes, numerating 115,120 particles showed structural details that 
warranted further image processing. The particles were unbinned to 0.98 Å/pixel and 
classified in 3D into 10 classes with the GluA2-GSG1LZK-1. Resulting were two prominent 
classes, GluA2-GSG1Lapo-1 (20,392 particles) and GluA2-GSG1Lapo-2 (18,926 particles), 
which were refined with C2-symmetry, and resemble the two states observed for GluA2-
GSG1L in the presence of ZK (Extended Data Figs 3 and 4).
A total of 4,116 micrographs were collected for GluA2-STZ, and 595,889 particles were 
automatically picked, with manually-picked particles used to generate reference classes as 
described above. The particles were binned twice to 2.16 Å/pixel and subject to 2D 
classification, which resulted in 581,495 particles being subject to further image processing. 
The original GluA2-2xSTZ antagonist-bound map15, low-pass filtered to 40 Å, was used as 
a reference model for 3D classification into ten classes without symmetry imposed. 3D 
classification resulted in 278,454 particles, from four classes, being chosen for further image 
processing, without observation of stoichiometric heterogeneity as in the DDM-solubilized 
complex15, and the particles were unbinned to 1.08 Å/pixel and classified in 3D to ten 
classes. Particles from three classes, numerating 69,207 particles and showing structurally-
similar features, were chosen for refinement. Initial refinement, with C2-symmetry, resulted 
in a 4.2 Å map, which showed side chain features in the GluA2 core but was lacking details 
for STZ. To better align particles according to the GluA2 TMD and STZ, we generated a 
soft spherical mask around the detergent micelle (which encompassed all of the GluA2 and 
STZ TMDs and STZ extracellular head). This resulted in an overall 4.0 Å map, with distinct

 side chain features throughout the TMD for model building of the GluA2 and STZ TMDs. 
We did not observe a digitonin-bound state of GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ, as we did for GluA2-
GSG1L in the resting states (GluA2-GSG1LZK-2, GluA2-GSG1Lapo-2).
The resolution for all reconstructions was estimated using the FSC=0.143 criterion62 
between independent half maps on corrected FSC curves in which the influences of the mask 
were removed63 (Extended Data Fig. 1). All maps were postprocessed using a softmask in 
RELION, and B-factors for map sharpening were automatically estimated (Extended Data 
Table 1). All visualization of EM densities was done in UCSF Chimera64. Local resolution 
for each map (Extended Data Fig. 2) was calculated with unfiltered half maps using 
ResMap65.
Model Building
To build the state 1 ZK-bound and GluA2-GSG1L models we individually isolated the ATD 
and LBD dimers, as well as the TMD, from the GluA2-2xGSG1LZK complex structure16 
using rigid-body fitting in COOT66. Side chains in the TMD were defined based on local 
resolution, as was the structure of the M2 helix and pore loop. The resulting model was 
refined against an un-filtered half map (work) in real space with constraints using 
PHENIX67. The refined model was tested for overfitting (Extended Data Fig. 2) by shifting 
the coordinates with shake in PHENIX and building a density in EMAN268 from the shaken 
model. FSC was calculated between the densities from the shaken model, the map used in 
PHENIX refinement (work), second half map (free) and unfiltered sum map, using EMAN2. 
The resulting GluA2-GSG1LZK-1 model was used as a basis to build GluA2-GSG1Lapo-1. 
Correspondingly, the ATD and LBD local dimers were moved as rigid bodies to define the 
state 2 models (GluA2-GSG1LZK-2 and GluA2-GSG1Lapo-2), and features were adjusted 
manually according to high resolution features in GluA2-GSG1LZK-2. Secondary structure 
features of the M3 pore were further defined in the GluA2-GSG1LZK-2 M3 density. The 
resulting models were also real space refined in PHENIX and tested for overfitting 
(Extended Data Fig. 2). State 2 models were refined in the absence of digitonin.
For GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ, we rigid-body fit the high-resolution structures of the ATD45 and 
glutamate/CTZ-bound LBD35. We individually rigid body fit helices from the TMD of our 
GluA2-GSG1LZK-1 refined structure, and rigid-body fit STZ subunits from the 
GluA2-2xSTZZK structure15 in COOT for an initial model. After increasing the resolution in 
the TMD map, we built STZ and the GluA2 TMD de novo. The resulting models were also 
real space refined in PHENIX and tested for overfitting (Extended Data Fig. 2), of which 
there are no signs of over-fit models. Structures were visualized and figures were prepared in 
Pymol67.

 Extended Data Figure 8. iGluR Gating Mechanism
Two of four iGluR subunits are shown with the ATDs omitted. Four basic states of iGluR 
gating are illustrated: Resting, represented by apo (GluA2-GSG1Lapo-1) or antagonist-bound 
closed state (GluA2-GSG1LZK-1) structures; Closed, agonist-bound (pre-active state crystal 
structures10,11); Open (GluA2-STZGlu+CTZ) and Desensitized (GluA2-2xGSG1LQuis 
complex16). Transitions between the states are indicated by black arrows, conformational 
rearrangements by blue arrows and ionic current through the open channel by an orange 
arrow. Upper and lower gates are indicated by one and two red asterisks, respectively, with 
red sticks at the upper gate representing channel occluding residues at the bundle crossing 
and the Q/R site at the lower gate. Glutamate molecules are illustrated by orange wedges. 
The receptor sits in a resting, closed state, with its LBD clamshells in the maximally open 
conformations, unoccupied by the neurotransmitter glutamate. Upon glutamate binding, the 
LBD clamshells close, as described in the pre-activated crystal structures, to an intermediate 
state that does not put enough strain on the LBD-TMD linkers to open the channel. The 
LBDs then transition to their maximally-closed state, which strains the LBD-TMD linkers, 
causing the channel pore to open and conduct ions. Most AMPA receptors, however, quickly 
desensitize, transitioning to the desensitized state from the open state via the agonist-bound, 
closed state. Desensitization is accompanied by the rupture of the upper LBD interfaces,
