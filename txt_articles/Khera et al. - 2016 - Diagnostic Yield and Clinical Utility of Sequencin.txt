Abstract
Background—About 7% of US adults have severe hypercholesterolemia (untreated LDL 
cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl). Such high LDL levels may be due to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), 
a condition caused by a single mutation in any of three genes. Lifelong elevations in LDL 
cholesterol in FH mutation carriers may confer CAD risk beyond that captured by a single LDL 
cholesterol measurement.
Objectives—Assess the prevalence of a FH mutation among those with severe 
hypercholesterolemia and determine whether CAD risk varies according to mutation status beyond 
the observed LDL cholesterol.
Methods—Three genes causative for FH (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9) were sequenced in 26,025 
participants from 7 case-control studies (5,540 CAD cases, 8,577 CAD-free controls) and 5 
prospective cohort studies (11,908 participants). FH mutations included loss-of-function variants 
in LDLR, missense mutations in LDLR predicted to be damaging, and variants linked to FH in 
ClinVar, a clinical genetics database.
Results—Among 8,577 CAD-free control participants, 430 had LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl; of 
these, only eight (1.9%) carried a FH mutation. Similarly, among 11,908 participants from 5 
prospective cohorts, 956 had LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl and of these, only 16 (1.7%) carried a 
FH mutation. Within any stratum of observed LDL cholesterol, risk of CAD was higher among FH 
mutation carriers when compared with non-carriers. When compared to a reference group with 
LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dl and no mutation, participants with LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl and 
no FH mutation had six-fold higher risk for CAD (OR 6.0; 95%CI 5.2–6.9) whereas those with 
LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl as well as a FH mutation demonstrated twenty-two fold increased 
risk (OR 22.3; 95%CI 10.7–53.2).
Conclusions—Among individuals with LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl, gene sequencing identified 
a FH mutation in <2%. However, for any given observed LDL cholesterol, FH mutation carriers 
are at substantially increased risk for CAD.

 Introduction
Primary, severe hypercholesterolemia, defined as having a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dl, is a treatable risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD)1,2; 
current treatment guidelines place particular emphasis on intensive lifestyle and 
pharmacologic therapy in this population.3 One etiology of severely elevated LDL 
cholesterol is familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant monogenic 
disorder linked to impaired hepatic clearance of LDL cholesterol particles.4 It is often 
assumed that individuals with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dl have FH but this may not be the 
case. Large-scale gene sequencing provides an opportunity to clarify the diagnostic yield 
and clinical impact of identifying a FH mutation in severely hypercholesterolemic patients.
Previous studies of the diagnostic yield of genetic testing in severe hypercholesterolemia 
have focused on individuals with clinically-suspected FH and in these samples, a FH 
mutation prevalence ranging from 20 to 80% has been reported.5–16 This variability is likely 
due to differing ascertainment schemes based on family history, physical exam features, 
elevated LDL cholesterol at a young age, or referral to specialized clinics, each of which 
may enrich for monogenic etiologies. In contrast, if ascertainment from the general 
population is based solely on elevated LDL cholesterol, the extent to which FH mutations 
contribute to severe hypercholesterolemia is unknown. Such knowledge may inform design 
and effectiveness of universal FH screening proposals.17–18
Knowledge of FH mutation status may also provide CAD risk information beyond that of a 
single LDL cholesterol measurement. 4,18 A FH mutation leads to cumulative exposure to 
higher LDL cholesterol levels over a lifetime and as such, within any stratum of LDL 
cholesterol, the risk of CAD may be greater if the LDL elevation is due to a monogenic 
mutation versus other causes. The extent to which CAD risk is modulated by the presence of 
a causal FH mutation is uncertain.
We analyzed gene sequences of three FH genes, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), 
apolipoprotein B (APOB), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), in 
twelve distinct cohorts including >26,000 participants to determine: 1) the diagnostic yield 
of gene sequencing to identify a FH mutation in severely hypercholesterolemic individuals; 
and 2) the clinical impact of a FH mutation with regard to CAD risk within any given 
stratum of LDL cholesterol levels.
Methods
Study Populations
Whole exome sequencing was performed in seven previously described CAD case-control 
cohorts of the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (Supplementary Table 1). Studies 
included the Italian Atherosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology study, 19 the Exome 
Sequencing Project Early-Onset Myocardial Infarction (ESP-EOMI) study,20 a nested case-
control of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS),15 the Munich Myocardial Infarction study,22 the 
Ottawa Heart Study,23 the Precocious Coronary Artery Disease (PROCARDIS) study,24 and 
the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS).25 The effect of lipid-lowering

 therapy in those reporting use at the time of lipid measurement was taken into account by 
dividing the measured total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by 0.8 and 0.7 respectively as 
has been implemented previously.26–28 Primary, severe LDL cholesterol elevation was 
defined as ≥ 190 mg/dl in accordance with current cholesterol treatment guidelines.3
The prevalence of a FH mutation in individuals with a LDL cholesterol > 190 mg/dl was 
additionally determined in 11,908 participants from five prospective cohort studies derived 
from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) 
Consortium:29 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health 
Study, Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Rotterdam Baseline Study, and Erasmus Rucphen 
Family Study (Supplementary Table 2).
In order to determine the cumulative exposure to LDL cholesterol according to FH mutation 
status, publically available data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
dbGAP database was analyzed. These data included 5,727 ARIC cohort participants and 
2,714 FHS Offspring Study participants.
Gene Sequencing
The CAD case-control whole exome sequencing was performed as previously described at 
the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA).20 The population-based cohort sequencing was 
performed at the Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, Texas) for the ARIC, CHS, and FHS 
cohorts and at Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, Netherlands) for the RS and ERF 
cohorts respectively. Additional sequencing methodology details available in Supplementary 
Methods.
Genetic Variant Annotation
Three classes of genetic variants were aggregated with respect to association with FH: 1) 
loss of function variants in LDLR: single base changes that introduce a stop codon leading 
to premature truncation of a protein (nonsense), insertions or deletions (indels) of DNA that 
scramble the protein translation beyond the variant site (frameshift), or point mutations at 
sites of pre-mRNA splicing that alter the splicing process (splice-site); 2) missense variants 
in LDLR predicted to be deleterious by each of five in silico prediction algorithms (LRT 
score, MutationTaster, PolyPhen-2 HumDiv, PolyPhen-2 HumVar and Sorting Intolerant 
From Tolerant (SIFT)) as described previously; 20,30 and 3) Variants in LDLR, APOB, or 
PCSK9, annotated as “pathogenic” or “likely pathogenic” in ClinVar, a publically available 
archive of genetic variations associated with clinical phenotypes.31 Additional sensitivity 
analyses aggregated all rare (allele frequency < 0.01) missense mutations in LDLR, exon 26 
of APOB which encodes key components of apolipoprotein B binding to the LDL receptor 
and harbor the majority of APOB variants linked to FH,32 and those that produce a change 
in PCSK9 at an amino acid associated with FH in ClinVar. Rare synonymous variants at 
these same locations were included as a negative control. Software used to annotate 
observed variants included Variant Effect Predictor (version 77) 33 and associated LOFTEE 
plugin,34 and the dbNSFP database (version 3.0b1).35

 Longitudinal Analysis of LDL Cholesterol Exposure
Individuals with a FH mutation and LDL cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl were identified in ARIC 
and FHS Offspring Study cohorts. LDL cholesterol values were adjusted in those reporting 
lipid-lowering therapy by dividing measured value by 0.7. Mean LDL cholesterol exposure 
was calculated as cumulative exposure, determined via an area under the curve analysis, 
divided by length of follow-up. 27 FH mutation carriers met the above inclusion criteria and 
were matched 1:1 to a mutation negative control according to age (within 10 years), gender, 
statin use at time of last visit, and similar LDL cholesterol at last visit (within 10 mg/dl). A 
match was available in 25 of 27 (93%) individuals. Mean LDL cholesterol exposure was 
compared among those with and without FH mutation using a paired t-test.
Statistical Analysis
The impact of aggregations of genetic variants on levels of LDL cholesterol was assessed 
using linear regression with adjustment for age, age2, gender, cohort, and the first five 
principal components of ancestry. Odds ratios for CAD were calculated using logistic 
regression with adjustment for gender, cohort, and the first five principal components of 
ancestry. In analyses conducted on ordinal strata of LDL cholesterol, individuals with LDL 
cholesterol <130 mg/dl and no mutation linked to FH served as the reference group.
Analyses were performed using R version 3.2.2 software (The R Project for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria). Figures were creating using the “ggplot2” package within R.36
Results
Within the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium CAD case-control cohorts, a total of 
14,117 participants with both LDL cholesterol level and sequence data for FH genes were 
available for analysis – 8,577 CAD-free controls and 5,540 CAD cases (Supplementary 
Table 3). The study population included 10,421 (74%) males with mean age 53 years (SD 
14). Proportions of self-identified race were 47%, 46%, and 7% for White, South Asian, and 
Black respectively. 47% of study participants had a history of hypertension, 27% had a 
history of diabetes, 34% were current smokers, and 14% were on lipid-lowering 
medications.
Sequencing identified 86 variants linked to FH on the basis of leading to loss of function in 
LDLR, missense mutations in LDLR predicted to be damaging by each of five computer 
prediction algorithms, or a variant in LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 previously linked to FH in 
the ClinVar genetics database. These included 13 premature stop (“nonsense”) codons, 6 
splice acceptor/donor variants, 4 frameshift mutations, and 63 missense mutations 
(Supplementary Table 4).
164 individuals harbored a mutation linked to FH, including 48 CAD-free controls (0.6%; 
95%CI 0.4 – 0.7%) and 116 CAD cases (2.1%; 95%CI 1.7 – 2.5%) (Supplementary Table 
5). The mutation was located in LDLR for 141 participants (86%), in APOB for 22 (13%), 
and in PCSK9 for 1 (0.6%) (Supplementary Table 4). Only one homozygote (or compound 
heterozygote) participant was identified; a 33-year old patient with LDL cholesterol of 539 
mg/dl and CAD was homozygous for a p.Q33* premature stop codon in LDLR.

 Diagnostic Yield of Gene Sequencing in Severe Hypercholesterolemia
Among 8,577 CAD-free control participants from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics 
Consortium cohorts, LDL cholesterol approximated a normal distribution (Supplementary 
Figure 1). The prevalence of a FH mutation increased across categories of LDL cholesterol 
levels (P < 0.001) (Supplementary Figure 2). Of 8,577 control participants, 430 participants 
(5% of control sample) had LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dl and of these 430, only 8 carried a 
FH mutation (1.9%; 95%CI 0.9 – 3.8%) (Table 1 & Central Illustration).
This prevalence estimate was replicated in 11,908 participants from five prospective cohort 
studies of the CHARGE consortium; 956 (8%) had a LDL cholesterol >190 mg/dl and of 
these, 16 (1.7%; 95%CI 1.0 – 2.8%) harbored a FH mutation. Across the twelve studies 
combined (n=20,485), 1386 (7%) displayed LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dl and of these, 24 
(1.7%) carried a FH mutation (Table 1).
Clinical Impact of FH Mutation Identification on CAD Risk
In the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium case-control studies, the presence of a FH 
mutation was associated with a 50 mg/dl (95%CI 44– 57) increase in LDL cholesterol and a 
3.8 fold (95%CI 2.6 – 5.4) increase in odds of CAD. These effects were most pronounced in 
those with loss of function mutations in LDLR (Figure 1). Average LDL cholesterol was 190 
mg/dl in those with a FH mutation and 73/164 (45%) had a LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dl. 
However, despite the observed large effect on average levels, a wide spectrum of circulating 
LDL cholesterol concentrations was noted in those who were mutation positive (Figure 2). 
44 of 164 (27%) mutation carriers had an observed LDL cholesterol less than 130 mg/dl; 
reflecting incomplete penetrance. An aggregation of all rare missense mutations had a 
modest impact on both LDL cholesterol and CAD risk. As expected, synonymous mutations, 
which do not lead to a change in amino acid sequence, had no effect on either parameter 
(Figure 1). Beyond LDL cholesterol levels, a FH mutation was associated with a nominally 
significant reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (−1.9 mg/dl; 95%CI −3.7 – 
−0.1; p = 0.04) but no association with circulating triglycerides (p = 0.36).
Within the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium case-control cohort populations, 
those with a FH mutation were at substantially higher risk compared to those without a 
mutation (Table 2, p-value for difference = 0.001). For participants with both LDL 
cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dl and a FH mutation, the odds of coronary artery disease were 
increased twenty-two fold (OR 22.3; CI 10.7 – 53.2) when compared to those with LDL 
cholesterol < 130 mg/dl and no mutation. For participants with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dl 
and no FH mutation, odds of coronary artery disease were increased six-fold (OR 6.0; CI 5.2 
– 6.9) compared to the same reference group. This difference persisted after additional 
adjustment for measured LDL cholesterol level (p = 0.02).
Separation of the population into clinically relevant categories of LDL cholesterol levels 
demonstrated trends towards higher risk in those with a FH mutation within each stratum 
(Central Illustration; Supplementary Table 6). The impact of a FH mutation was similar 
across strata of LDL cholesterol levels (p-interaction = 0.51). Within the subgroup of 
participants with a LDL cholesterol in the ≥ 190 to 220 mg/dl range, those with a mutation

 had 17-fold increased CAD risk versus 5-fold for those without a mutation. This difference 
was noted despite similar observed LDL cholesterol levels in this stratum (mean LDL 
cholesterol in those with mutation=205 mg/dl versus mean LDL cholesterol in those without 
a FH mutation = 203 mg/dl; p-value for difference = 0.22).
Cumulative LDL Cholesterol Exposure According to FH Mutation Status
For any given observed LDL cholesterol, those harboring a mutation might have a higher 
average LDL cholesterol exposure over their lifetime compared to those who do not harbor a 
mutation and this could explain a higher CAD risk among mutation carriers. We tested this 
hypothesis using two prospective cohort studies – ARIC and the FHS Offspring Study – 
where sequencing data and serial measurements of LDL cholesterol were available. We 
identified 25 individuals with a FH mutation and LDL cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl. Mean LDL 
cholesterol at time of last study visit was 185 mg/dl. As compared to matched non-carriers 
with similar LDL cholesterol at the last visit, individuals with a FH mutation had a 17 mg/dl 
(95%CI 5 – 29; p = 0.007) higher average LDL cholesterol exposure in the years preceding 
the last visit (Figure 3; Supplementary Table 7).
Discussion
Among 20,485 multiethnic participants from 12 studies, we found that 1,386 (7%) had 
severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dl) and of those with severe 
hypercholesterolemia, only a small fraction (<2%) also carried a FH mutation. However, 
within any stratum of LDL cholesterol, those who carried a FH mutation were at 
substantially higher risk for CAD compared to those who did not. This increased CAD risk 
among mutation carriers was at least partially explained by a greater cumulative exposure to 
LDL cholesterol over a lifetime.
These results permit several conclusions. First, FH mutations explain only a small fraction of 
severe hypercholesterolemia in the population. Previous reports have noted a substantially 
higher rate of mutation detection in those with clinically-suspected FH, as ascertained on the 
basis of features (e.g. family history, physical exam, or severe hypercholesterolemia at a 
young age) that enrich for a monogenic etiology.5–16 Here, we address a scientific question – 
what fraction of severely hypercholesterolemic individuals carry a mutation in any of three 
high LDL genes – that is distinct from these earlier, seminal reports. When participants are 
ascertained solely on the basis of a single elevated LDL cholesterol level, we identify a FH 
mutation in fewer than 2% of severely hypercholesterolemic individuals. These sequencing 
results are broadly consistent with those of a recent study of 98,098 individuals from the 
Copenhagen General Population Study in which genotyping of the four most common FH 
mutations was used to extrapolate overall FH mutation prevalence. In this Danish study, of 
5,332 individuals with LDL cholesterol ≥ 5 mmol/l (193 mg/dl), fewer than 5% were 
predicted to harbor a FH mutation.28
If not a monogenic mutation in the three FH genes, what might be the cause of elevated LDL 
cholesterol in the remaining >95% of participants with severe hypercholesterolemia? 
Possibilities include polygenic hypercholesterolemia, lifestyle factors, and/or a combination 
of these. For example, individuals in the top quartile of a polygenic LDL cholesterol gene

 score comprised of 95 common variants were 13 fold more likely to have high LDL 
cholesterol.37 Similarly, individuals in the top decile of a LDL cholesterol gene score 
comprised of 12 common variants were 4.2 fold more likely to have a LDL ≥ 190 mg/dl in 
the UK Whitehall II study.38 Future genetics studies may identify additional causal variants, 
genes beyond those considered in this study, or large-effect regulatory variants that underlie 
severe hypercholesterolemia. Other non-genetic explanations for severe elevations in LDL 
cholesterol include secondary causes (e.g. hypothyroidism or nephrotic syndrome), lifestyle 
factors such as dietary fat, or some combination of these.
Second, within any stratum of a single observed LDL cholesterol, CAD risk was higher in 
those with a FH mutation when compared to those without, reinforcing the potential utility 
of genetic testing. We analyzed 25 matched pairs of individuals with similarly elevated LDL 
cholesterol levels at time of ascertainment and found a higher cumulative exposure to LDL 
cholesterol in those with a FH mutation. These data support the hypothesis that a FH 
mutation, present since birth, increases CAD risk via lifelong exposure to high LDL 
cholesterol.39 By contrast, an isolated elevation in LDL cholesterol in those without a 
genetic predisposition may reflect a time-limited exposure related to a current environmental 
perturbation or a value that is more likely to regress towards the mean in the future. Future 
studies may identify additional metabolic parameters, such as increased lipoprotein(a) 
levels,40 that also contribute to the excess CAD risk noted in those with a FH mutation.
Finally, these data contribute to ongoing discussion regarding how to define FH. Classically, 
FH refers to elevated LDL cholesterol caused by a single mutation in any of several genes 
segregating in an autosomal dominant manner. Alternate approaches to two features – LDL 
cholesterol threshold and mutation definition – impact FH prevalence estimates (Table 3). 
An approach that includes all individuals with untreated LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dl (i.e., 
without a FH mutation requirement) would combine non-genetic and genetic causes and 
classify about 7% of the US adult population as having FH. An alternative possibility is to 
withhold an LDL cholesterol threshold and require only a stringent mutation definition; in 
such an analysis of 20,485 participants, we identified a FH mutation in 97 individuals (1 in 
211). This estimate is nearly identical to a population-based analysis in the Copenhagen 
General Population Study (1 in 217).28 However, if one additionally requires that a FH 
mutation is accompanied by an elevated LDL cholesterol, FH prevalence in our study 
declines (1 in 301 with LDL threshold ≥130 mg/dl and 1 in 853 with LDL threshold ≥ 190 
mg/dl).
With regard to defining a FH mutation, all schema agree on the inclusion of loss of function 
alleles in LDLR but differ on how to handle missense mutations. For missense mutations, we 
applied a rigorous threshold – requiring that the mutation be designated as damaging by 
each of five computer prediction algorithms or be previously annotated as pathogenic in the 
ClinVar clinical genetics database. A key advantage of this approach is that it ensures that 
classification is both fully reproducible and generalizable to genes beyond those related to 
FH.
When routine genetic testing is not available, clinical scoring systems such as the Dutch 
Lipid Clinical Network, Simon Broome, and MEDPED criteria have been developed to

 approximate FH status.4 Ongoing collaborative efforts on how to optimally incorporate 
population-based genetic sequencing data into existing frameworks for the clinical diagnosis 
of FH will be critically important.
Study Limitations
Our data did not permit stratifying individuals by family history or physical exam features, 
as suggested by the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network and Simon Broome criteria.41,42 Secondly, 
we accounted for an estimated 30% reduction in LDL cholesterol in those on lipid-lowering 
therapy as has been previously implemented.26–28 This approach may imperfectly estimate 
untreated LDL cholesterol given heterogeneity in drug selection, dosing, response, and 
variability across baseline LDL cholesterol levels or mutation status. However, a sensitivity 
analysis limited to Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium cohort participants not on 
lipid-lowering therapy similarly noted a pronounced difference in risk among severely 
hypercholesterolemic individuals when stratified by mutation status (Supplementary Table 
8). Third, structural and copy number genetic variation are inadequately captured by current 
exome sequencing techniques and as such, some FH mutations may have been missed. 
Fourth, our approach to annotating missense variants using prediction algorithms and the 
ClinVar database may have led to misclassification in some cases. Additional studies that 
implement large-scale functional screens of identified variants or pool phenotypes across 
additional studies may provide additional refinement of pathogenicity annotations. Lastly, 
FH mutation prevalence was determined in CAD-free controls and population-based cohorts. 
These individuals survived to middle-age and few had clinically manifest CAD, raising the 
possibility of survivorship or selection bias. Our case-control population was enriched for 
individuals with premature CAD; effect estimates of mutations on coronary risk may be 
different in patients with later disease onset.
Conclusions
Genetic sequencing identified a FH mutation in only a small proportion of severely 
hypercholesterolemic individuals. For any given observed LDL cholesterol level, risk for 
CAD is substantially higher in carriers of a FH mutation versus non-carriers, likely related in 
large part to higher lifelong exposure to atherogenic LDL particles. A primary goal of 
precision medicine is to use molecular diagnostics to identify a small subset of the 
population at increased disease risk in which to deliver an intervention. Systematic efforts to 
identify and treat severely hypercholesterolemic individuals who carry a FH mutation may 
represent one such opportunity.

 Perspectives
Competency in Medical Knowledge 1: Sequencing of three genes causative for 
familial hypercholesterolemia identifies a mutation in only a small fraction of 
severely hypercholesterolemic individuals.
Competency in Medical Knowledge 2: For any given observed LDL cholesterol, 
those who harbor a familial hypercholesterolemia mutation are at substantially 
increased risk of coronary disease as compared to noncarriers, likely related to 
increased lifelong exposure to LDL cholesterol.
Translational Outlook 1: Future research will determine the relative contributions 
of novel genes, other common and rare genetic variants, and lifestyle factors to 
severe hypercholesterolemia.
Translational Outlook 2: Additional research is needed to understand if genetic 
testing may prove clinically useful in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia.

 Figure 1. Impact of Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Rare Missense, and Rare Synonymous 
Mutations on LDL Cholesterol and Coronary Artery Disease
For each class of variants, the number of individuals within the 14,117 participants of the 
Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium case-control studies and % of CAD cases and 
CAD-free controls is provided. Number of individuals within each mutation category sum to 
more than the overall familial hypercholesterolemia mutation numbers due to overlap across 
variant classification. Increase in LDL cholesterol values determined via linear regression 
with adjustment for age, age2, gender, cohort, and principal components of ancestry. Odds 
ratios for CAD were calculated via logistic regression with adjustment for gender, cohort, 
and principal components of ancestry.

 Figure 3. Cumulative LDL cholesterol Exposure in Familial Hypercholesterolemia Mutation 
Carriers Compared on Non-carriers Matched on LDL cholesterol at Ascertainment
Hypercholesterolemic [low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl] carriers of a 
familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) mutation were identified in the Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities (ARIC) and Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohorts and matched 
1:1 to a FH mutation non-carriers according to age, gender, statin use, and LDL cholesterol 
at time of ascertainment. Mean ± standard error (SE) LDL cholesterol values at each study 
visit are displayed in each cohort according to mutation status. A matched pairs t-test 
demonstrated higher cumulative exposure to LDL cholesterol in FH mutation carriers versus 
non-carriers.

For each classification scheme, we provide the number who meet the criteria out of a total 20,485 participants (CAD-free controls of the 
Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium combined with CHARGE Consortium participants). Loss of function variants defined as single base 
changes that introduce a stop codon leading to premature truncation of a protein (nonsense), insertions or deletions (indels) of DNA that scramble 
the protein translation beyond the variant site (frameshift), or point mutations at sites of pre-mRNA splicing that alter the splicing process (splice-
site). Predicted damaging variants refer to those LDLR predicted to be deleterious by each of five in silico prediction algorithms (LRT score, 
MutationTaster, PolyPhen-2 HumDiv, PolyPhen-2 HumVar and Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT)). Rare variants refers to those with minor 
allele frequency < 1% in the sequenced population.
