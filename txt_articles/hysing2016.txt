SUMMARY
The aim of the current study was to assess the association between
sleep duration and sleep patterns and academic performance in 16–19
year-old adolescents using registry-based academic grades. A large
population-based
study
from
Norway
conducted
in
2012,
the
youth@hordaland-survey, surveyed 7798 adolescents aged 16–19 years
(53.5% girls). The survey was linked with objective outcome data on
school performance. Self-reported sleep measures provided information
on sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep deficit and bedtime differences
between weekday and weekend. School performance [grade point
average (GPA)] was obtained from official administrative registries. Most
sleep parameters were associated with increased risk for poor school
performance. After adjusting for sociodemographic information, short
sleep duration and sleep deficit were the sleep measures with the highest
odds of poor GPA (lowest quartile). Weekday bedtime was associated
significantly with GPA, with adolescents going to bed between 22:00 and
23:00 hours having the best GPA. Also, delayed sleep schedule during
weekends was associated with poor academic performance. The
associations were somewhat reduced after additional adjustment for
non-attendance at school, but remained significant in the fully adjusted
models. In conclusion, the demonstrated relationship between sleep
problems
and
poor
academic
performance
suggests
that
careful
assessment of sleep is warranted when adolescents are underperform-
ing at school. Future studies are needed on the association between
impaired sleep in adolescence and later functioning in adulthood.
INTRODUCTION
The link between sleep and academic performance is an
important research domain, particularly in the later adoles-
cent years, as school performance is linked closely to
subsequent educational and work attainment (De Ridder
et al., 2012). Sleep and academic performance may be
related through several pathways and mechanisms. A direct
effect of sleep has been shown in experimental studies in
which sleep restriction has resulted in impaired learning and
memory performance in early adolescence (Curcio et al.,
2006). Sleep may also impact upon academic performance
indirectly through tardiness or school absence, which often
accompanies sleep problems in this age group (Hysing et al.,
2015). Finally, there may be confounding factors, such as
socioeconomic status (SES) known to be related to both
sleep (Boe et al., 2012) and school performance (Sirin,
2005), that might account for some of the association.
A meta-analysis including 17 studies of children and
adolescents from 2010 confirmed a significant, but modest,
association
between
sleep
quality,
sleep
duration
and
sleepiness
and
academic
performance
(Dewald
et al.,
2010). A similar conclusion was reached in a more recent
review (Shochat et al., 2014). However, there are several
shortcomings in the existing literature. First, most studies
have relied solely upon subjective reports of exposure (sleep)

J Sleep Res. (2016) 25, 318–324
Sleep and academic performance
 and outcomes (academic performance), with the inherent risk
of reporter bias. Secondly, most of the literature has included
samples with a very wide age range, and not focused
specifically on late adolescence, which is a particularly
important transitional period involving substantial changes
in sleep compared to prepuberty (Maslowsky and Ozer,
2014). Thirdly, a delayed sleep schedule, combined with
increasing differences
between
weekday and weekend
sleep, has been demonstrated in this age group, but thus
far these specific sleep parameters have received little
attention in relation to academic performance.
Based on these considerations, the main aim of the
present study was to assess the association between a
range of self-reported sleep variables and registry-based
grade point average (GPA) among 16–19-year-old high
school students. Based on the literature, we expected an
association between sleep variables and GPA, with lower
GPA among adolescent with short sleep duration and with a
delayed sleep schedule. Secondly, we aimed to investigate if
school absenteeism and sociodemographic factors could
account for this association.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Procedure
In this population-based study from 2012, we used data from
the youth@hordaland-survey of adolescents in the county of
Hordaland in western Norway. The general aim of the
youth@hordaland-survey was to assess mental health, life-
style, school performance and health service use in adoles-
cents. All adolescents born between 1993 and 1995 (aged
16–19 years) attending secondary education were invited,
through collaboration with Hordaland County, to participate.
The data were collected from February to May 2012, with the
majority collected in February. The adolescents received
information about the study via their official school e-mail,
and one school class (approximately 45 min) during regular
school hours was allocated for them to complete the internet-
based questionnaire. A teacher was present to organize the
data collection and to ensure confidentiality. They could
choose to complete the questionnaire at their own conve-
nience if they were not present at school that day. Survey
staff were available by telephone for both the adolescents
and school personnel to answer queries related to the
research.
Data from the youth@hordaland-survey were linked to
official registers from Hordaland County, which included
information on academic grades.
Sample
All adolescents born between 1993 and 1995 (n = 19 430)
were invited to participate in the youth@hordaland study that
took place during the first months of 2012, 10 220 of whom
agreed, yielding a participation rate of 53%. Sleep variables
were checked for validity of answers based on preliminary
data analysis, resulting in 374 adolescents being omitted due
to obvious invalid responses (e.g. negative sleep duration or
sleep efficiency). Among the 9846 remaining adolescents in
the 16–19-year age range, 2048 did not give consent to data
linkage to the official school register or were not in high
school, yielding a sample size of 7798 for the linked data set
that is used in the present study.
Measures
Sleep variables
The adolescents’ typical bedtime and rise-time were indi-
cated in hours and minutes using a scroll-down menu with 5-
min intervals, and were reported separately for weekend and
weekdays. Typical time in bed (TIB) was calculated by
subtracting bedtime from rise-time. Sleep onset latency
(SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were indicated
in hours and minutes using a scroll-down menu with 5-min
intervals, and sleep duration was defined as TIB minus SOL
and WASO. Sleep efficiency was calculated as sleep
duration divided by TIB multiplied by 100 (reported as a
percentage). Subjective sleep need was reported in hours
and minutes, and sleep deficit was calculated separately for
weekends and weekdays, subtracting total sleep duration
from subjective sleep need. For the purpose of the present
study, sleep duration was also split into six categories (<5, 5
to <6, 6 to <7, 7 to <8, 8 to <9, ≥9 h).
Academic performance and school absence
Academic grades were the official grades from the registers
of Hordaland County. The registry data were linked to the
youth@hordaland-survey for participants who consented to
participate in the study as a whole (including school registry
information), or consented specifically to the use of the
registry information. The GPA was calculated, representing
the average of the student’s grades during the term.
Secondary schools in Norway use a scale from 1 to 6, with
6 being the highest grade (outstanding competence) and 2
(low level of competence) as the lowest passing grade and 1
constituting failure. For analysis purposes, GPA was also
dichotomized at the 25th percentile (lowest quartile) as an
indicator of poor academic performance. The decision to use
quartiles as the cutoff was that the Norwegian grading system
is not easily transferable to settings in other countries and, as
such, absolute cutoffs would make less sense than for sleep
duration.
Official register-based data on school non-attendance
were also provided by Hordaland County Council, and
included both days and school-hours of absence during the
last semester (6 months). A joint variable for school absence
was also created, in which 6 h of non-attendance was
equivalent to 1 day of absence, as specified by Norwegian
school regulations.

 Sociodemographics
Gender and date of birth were identified through personal
identity number in the Norwegian National Population Regis-
ter. Exact age was estimated by calculating the time interval
between date of birth and date of participation. SES was
assessed both by parental education and perceived family
affluence. Maternal and paternal educations were reported
separately, with three response options: ‘primary school’,
‘secondary school’ and ‘college or university’. Perceived
family affluence (i.e. how well off the adolescent perceived
their family to be) was assessed by asking the adolescents
how their family affluence is compared to most others.
Response alternatives were (i) ‘better family affluence’, (ii)
‘approximately like most others’ and (iii) ‘poorer family
affluence’. A recent report from the second wave of the
Bergen Child Study, when the children were aged 11–
13 years, showed that the rating of family affluence corre-
lated reasonably well (r = 0.586, P < 0.001) with information
about taxable monetary income which was available for a
subsample of 642 participants (Bøe et al., 2014).
Ethics
The study was approved by the Regional Committee for
Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) in western
Norway. In accordance with the regulations from the REC
and
Norwegian
health
authorities,
adolescents
aged
16 years and older can make decisions regarding their own
health (including participation in health studies), and thus
gave consent themselves to participate in the current study.
Parents/guardians have the right to be informed, and in the
current study all parents/guardians received written informa-
tion about the study in advance.
Statistics
IBM SPSS version 22 for Mac (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
was used for all analyses. Analysis of variance (ANOVA),
independent-sample t-tests and chi-square tests were used
to examine the association between academic grades and
the demographic and sleep variables. Logistic regression
analyses were used to assess the association between sleep
variables (exposure) and poor academic performance (out-
come: GPA dichotomized at the 25th percentile). We calcu-
lated both crude (unadjusted) odds ratios and adjusted for the
following covariates entered simultaneously: age, gender,
parental education and perceived family affluence. Finally, a
fully adjusted model with additional adjustment for school
non-attendance was conducted. To examine gender differ-
ences, estimated marginal means (EMM) were calculated for
GPA in boys and girls separately for all sleep variables,
adjusting for age, parental education and perceived family
affluence. To examine possible age differences in these
associations, EMM were also calculated separately for GPA
in each age cohort. To adjust for multiple comparisons,
Bonferroni corrections were performed by setting the signif-
icance cutoff at a divided by number of tests. In the current
study, we performed a total of 15 tests at a = 0.05, which
means that we rejected the null hypothesis if the P-value was
less than 0.0033.
Representativeness of the sample
Compared to national and regional statistics provided by the
Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training (2014), the
mean GPA of all mandatory courses in the current study
[mean = 3.57, standard deviation (SD) = 0.99] was identical
to the national GPA in 2012 in this age cohort (mean = 3.57,
SD = 0.99; P = 0.999), but slightly lower than the GPA in
Hordaland county (mean = 3.61, SD = 0.99; P < 0.01).
RESULTS
Demographic characteristics and GPA
In all, 7798 adolescents provided valid responses on the
relevant sleep items in the linked sample. The mean age was
17 years, and the sample included more girls (53.5%) than
boys (46.5%). Girls had significantly higher GPA than boys
(GPA = 3.94 versus GPA = 3.73, respectively, P < 0.001).
Age was not associated significantly with GPA. Adolescents
whose parents had completed a college education had a
significantly higher GPA than parents with less education
(fathers: GPA = 4.09 versus GPA = 3.60, and mothers:
GPA = 4.10
versus
GPA = 3.73,
respectively,
both
Ps < 0.001). Adolescents with lower family affluence had
lower GPA (3.69) compared to families with good or average
(GPA = 3.86) family affluence (P < 0.001).
Sleep characteristics and GPA
There was a reverse J-shaped association between sleep
duration and GPA. As detailed in Table 1, adolescents
sleeping between 7 and 9 h had the highest GPA (4.0)
compared with both longer sleep duration (≥9 h: GPA = 3.9)
and especially short sleep duration (<5 h: GPA = 3.5). There
was a dose–response association between GPA and sleep
efficiency, with adolescents having a sleep efficiency of
≥90% having the highest GPA (4.0) compared to adoles-
cents with a sleep efficiency of <75% having a GPA of 3.5.
Similarly,
subjectively
reported
sleep
deficit
(sleep
need � actual sleep) showed a similar graded association
to GPA; adolescents with sleep deficit of ≥4 h had a GPA of
3.5, compared to a GPA of 4.0 in adolescents with a sleep
deficit of <2 h.
Weekday bedtime was associated significantly with GPA,
with
adolescents
going
to
bed
between
22:00
and
23:00 hours having the best GPA (4.0). The later the bedtime
during weekdays the lower the GPA but, of note, the GPA
was lower for adolescents with a bedtime earlier than
22:00 hours relative to those going to bed between 22:00

M. Hysing et al.
 and 23:00 hours. Similarly, large discrepancies between the
adolescents’ bedtime during weekends and weekdays were
associated significantly with lower GPA (see Table 1 for
details).
Sleep characteristics and poor academic performance
As detailed in Table 1, all sleep variables were associated
significantly with increased risk odds of poor academic
performance (defined as GPA in the lowest quartile) in a
dose–response manner. Adjusting for sociodemographic
information (age, gender, parental education and family
affluence) did not (or only slightly) attenuate the associations.
To examine if the associations could be explained by
increased non-attendance at school, an additional adjust-
ment was made for register-based school absence during the
last 6 months. As indicated in the last column in Table 1,
school non-attendance explained some of the variance;
however, all sleep variables also remained significant risk
factors for poor academic performance in the fully adjusted
analyses.
Gender and age differences
Fig. 1 displays the EMM of the GPAs for boys and girls, by all
sleep characteristics. Adjusted for confounders, girls had
higher GPA than boys across all categories of sleep
variables, and distinct dose–response associations were
found for both genders. There were no significant interaction
effects of gender and sleep variables, with the exception of
gender 9 bedtime differences between weekdays and week-
ends (F(4,7357) = 2.55, P = 0.037).
There were no significant interaction effects of age and any
of the sleep variables on GPA (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this population-based study of Norwegian adolescents,
poor sleep was related to lower academic performance. The
associations were in a dose–response manner, and were
present for sleep deficit, sleep efficiency, weekday bedtimes,
delayed sleep schedule during weekends and sleep duration,
with the latter having the highest odds of poor school

Sleep and school performance in adolescence
321
 performance as measured by GPA from official registries.
Non-attendance at school accounted for some, but not all, the
association.
The link between short sleep duration and impaired school
performance is in accordance with previous studies in
adolescents using subjective reports of academic functioning
(Chung and Cheung, 2008; Loessl et al., 2008). It also
confirms the results from a small study of 750 Italian
adolescents, where sleep complaints were related to aca-
demic functioning based on data from school registers
(Lazaratou et al., 2005). Most of the previous studies have
used samples with a wide age range (Loessl et al., 2008) or
have been restricted to sampling from a couple of schools,
which restricts generalizability (O’Brien and Mindell, 2005).
One exception is the large-scale Hong Kong study, that
supports the generalizability of the sleep debt and school
functioning association based on self-reported school perfor-
mance (Mak et al., 2012). The present study confirms the
generalizability due to a very large and representative
sample, and extends the literature further by employing
official register-based academic grades. Interestingly, the
association between sleep and academic performance was
not gender-specific. This is in contrast to a study conducted
in Greece, which found that sleep debt among boys affected
academic performance to a larger extent compared to girls’
sleep debt (Lazaratou et al., 2005). We do not know for
certain why the current study found no gender-specific
associations,
although
one
cannot
disregard
possible
methodological explanations, as the current study used a
much more comprehensive questionnaire of sleep parame-
ters, as well as objective data on GPA.
Weekday bedtime was associated significantly with GPA,
with
adolescents
going
to
bed
between
22:00
and
23:00 hours having the best GPA (4.0). Note that in Norway
a relatively small number of late teens in the 16–19-year age
group go to bed before 22:00 hours (3.8%). We also found
that the later the bedtime, the lower the GPA. These findings
are consistent with a prior study conducted in the United
States (Asarnow et al., 2014). It should also be noted that
adolescents with a bedtime earlier than 22:00 hours had a
lower GPA compared to those going to bed between 22:00
and 23:00 hours. Although we do not have data allowing us
to explore this interesting finding further, this small group
may, for example, comprise adolescents with somatic health
problems. Also notable is that larger discrepancies between
the adolescents’ bedtime during weekends and weekdays,
as well as low sleep efficiency, were associated significantly
with lower GPA. Together these findings suggest that earlier
bedtimes and encouraging regular bed- and wake-times
across the week are likely to be important intervention
targets. Indeed, moving bedtimes earlier by 20–30 min per
week is a commonly used intervention for delayed sleep
phase problems, and regularizing bed- and wake-times are
core interventions within stimulus control (Bootzin and
Nicassio, 1978).
By controlling for potential confounders, we aimed to
identify possible mechanisms which may be involved in the
association between poor sleep and poor academic perfor-
mance. School absence accounted for some of the associ-
ations between poor sleep and poor academic functioning.
However, there was still a significant association when
missed school hours and days were accounted for. This

 suggests that other factors besides missed school classes
may be present. We expected that the adolescents’ family
SES might have been a confounder. While family SES in the
current study was related negatively to school performance,
in line with expectations (Sirin, 2005), controlling for sociode-
mographics only slightly attenuated the associations. There
may also be other confounders that we have not considered
in the present study. One example is chronic illness and
learning disabilities that could be related to both sleep and
academic performance. Mental health problems comprise
another possible confounder of this association. While this
was beyond the scope of the present study, future research
should focus on identifying other possible confounders and
pathways by which sleep may be related to academic
performance. Finally, it should be noted that girls overall
had a significantly higher GPA compared to boys, irrespec-
tive of sleep variables. This is also in line with previous
research showing that girls have better academic perfor-
mance in general in this age group.
Strengths and limitations
The present study is based on a broad and detailed
assessment
of
sleep.
The
measures
add
to
earlier
epidemiological studies with the inclusion of SOL and
wake-time during the night. When defining what constitutes
a ‘sleep deficit’, we used the respondents’ perceived sleep
need as the norm. On average, this variable was in
accordance
with
expert
recommended
sleep
duration
(Carskadon et al., 1980), suggesting that normative sleep
data
would
have
given
comparable
results.
A
major
strength of the study is the use of data from administrative
registries on academic performance, reducing the risk of
mono-informant bias.
There are limitations that should be noted. Data stem from
one county in Norway, and although the distribution of urban
and rural areas reflects Norway a whole, the possible limited
generalizability must be taken into account. Also, attrition
from the study could affect generalizability. In the present
study, only adolescents who attended high school (due to the
outcome measures being academic grades) were included.
Official data show that in 2012, 92% of all adolescents in
Norway aged 16–18 attended high school [The Directorate of
Integration and Diversity (IMDi), 2012], which would make
our actual eligible population an estimated 17 875. Never-
theless, there is a large attrition to the study. In the present
study, we conducted representativity analyses on the GPA of
the sample, and these indicated that the academic perfor-
mance was representative for the region and the country as a
whole. Based on previous research from the former waves of
the Bergen Child Study (the same population as the current
study), non-participants have also been shown to have more
psychological problems than participants (Stormark et al.,
2008), and it is therefore likely that the prevalence of mental
health problems or, in this case, sleep problems, could be
underestimated.
The sleep measure was based on the general pattern of
sleep, and the grades are the GPA of the past semester.
Thus, stability of the assessed variables is expected, and
therefore variations and changes in sleep and consequent
impact on changes school achievement may not be inferred
from the present study.
The cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow for
causal inferences. We cannot exclude the alternative hypoth-
esis that academic performance leads to sleep problems
through distress or stress related to poor results, or that late-
night studying may be at the expense of sleep (Gillen-O’Neel
et al., 2013). Secondly, all sleep data were obtained by self-
report. Although self-reported sleep parameters, including
SOL and WASO, typically differ from those obtained from
objective assessments (Lauderdale et al., 2008), recent
studies have shown that such self-report sleep assessments
can be recommended for the characterization of sleep
parameters in both clinical and population-based research
(Zinkhan et al., 2014). Also, the accuracy of self-reported
SOL and WASO are generally better among adolescents
than in older adults (Dillon et al., 2015), and a recent study of
young adolescents in Hong Kong found good agreement
between actigraphy-measured and questionnaire-reported
sleep durations (Kong et al., 2011).
CONCLUSION
In summary, the results underscore the importance of sleep
for academic functioning. If adolescents are not able to
perform according to their own academic potential this may
have important short-term consequences for their GPA, but
again may give rise to a range of negative adult functional
outcomes. Academic performance is an important marker for
future work affiliation and health. Future studies should
investigate further how the association between sleep and
school impacts upon future educational status and work
affiliation.
