Abstract The sarcomere is the contractile unit within cardiomyocytes driving heart muscle
contraction. We sought to test the mechanisms regulating actin and myosin filament assembly
during sarcomere formation. Therefore, we developed an assay using human cardiomyocytes to
monitor sarcomere assembly. We report a population of muscle stress fibers, similar to actin arcs in
non-muscle cells, which are essential sarcomere precursors. We show sarcomeric actin filaments
arise directly from muscle stress fibers. This requires formins (e.g., FHOD3), non-muscle myosin IIA
and non-muscle myosin IIB. Furthermore, we show short cardiac myosin II filaments grow to form
~1.5 mm long filaments that then ‘stitch’ together to form the stack of filaments at the core of the
sarcomere (i.e., the A-band). A-band assembly is dependent on the proper organization of actin
filaments and, as such, is also dependent on FHOD3 and myosin IIB. We use this experimental
paradigm to present evidence for a unifying model of sarcomere assembly.

Introduction
At its core, a sarcomere is composed of ‘thick’ myosin II filaments, and ‘thin’ actin filaments
(Figure 1A) (Au, 2004). One sarcomere is measured from Z-line to Z-line, which contain a-actinin 2
(Figure 1A). The proper establishment of cardiac sarcomeres during development and their subse-
quent maintenance is critical for heart function. Previous studies in cultured myocytes have shown
the presence of actin bundles called ‘stress fiber-like structures’ similar in appearance to classic
stress fibers (Dlugosz et al., 1984). These stress fibers were often found to be close to the edge of
the myocyte with sarcomeres existing further from the edge (Rhee et al., 1994). These studies pro-
posed that the stress fibers served as a template for the formation of sarcomeres (Dlugosz et al.,
1984; Rhee et al., 1994; Sanger et al., 2005). The original model that proposed this was called the
Templating Model (Dlugosz et al., 1984), and was proposed before it was known these stress fibers
contained both non-muscle and sarcomeric proteins (Rhee et al., 1994). Beyond non-muscle myosin
IIB (NMIIB), which is present in non-muscle cells, stress fibers in muscle cells contain muscle specific
proteins, such as a-actinin, tropomyosin, troponins, and tropomodulin (Almenar-Queralt et al.,
1999; Rhee et al., 1994; Sanger et al., 2005). Each of these proteins have non-muscle paralogs,
which likely serve similar functions (Bryce et al., 2003; Colpan et al., 2013; Co
ˆte
´, 1983;
Gunning et al., 2015; Lim et al., 1986; Sjo

 muscle specific proteins in stress fibers, the Templating Model was modified to the ‘Pre-Myofibril
Model’ (Rhee et al., 1994; Sanger et al., 2005). Even though these models have different names
and are often presented as mutually exclusive, they are very similar in their predictions. Specifically,
both models posit an actin bundle that appears structurally similar to a stress fiber will acquire a row
of sarcomeres over time to become a ‘myofibril’ (Dlugosz et al., 1984; Rhee et al., 1994;
Sanger et al., 2005) (Figure 1A). There is a vast amount of localization data in fixed cardiomyocytes
to support these models. However, there is very little dynamic data in live cells that suggests stress
fibers give rise to sarcomeres. The strongest dynamic support comes from imaging fluorescently
tagged a-actinin 2 in myocytes. Time montages from chick skeletal myotubes showed small puncta
of a-actinin 2 adding to pre-existing Z lines (McKenna et al., 1986). Subsequently, a time montage
was used to show a similar phenomenon occurring in chick cardiomyocytes (Dabiri et al., 1997).
Some in vivo data support the Template/Pre-Myofibril Model, while others do not. In strong sup-
port of the Template/Pre-Myofibril Model, static images of chick heart tissue have essentially
revealed every structure described in primary cultured chick cardiomyocytes (Du et al., 2008). The
presence of NMIIB-containing stress fibers in the cardiomyocytes was particularly clear (Du et al.,
2008). NMIIB germline knockout (KO) mice were also reported to have fewer and disorganized sar-
comeres via EM (Tullio et al., 1997). On the other hand, several studies have called into question
the role of stress fibers in sarcomere assembly. First, several studies examining cardiomyocytes
within mouse or chick heart tissue did not find stress fibers containing NMIIB (Ehler et al., 1999;
Kan-O et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2009). In addition, a conditional KO mouse that removes NMIIB
genetically at P9 apparently still had striated sarcomere structures (Ma et al., 2009). Finally, a condi-
tional heart KO of the other major paralog of NMII, NMIIA, was also reported to have no apparent
defects in heart formation (Conti et al., 2004; Conti et al., 2015). Taken together, the lack of clear
data showing stress fibers in cardiomyocytes and inconsistencies for a role of NMII in sarcomere
assembly calls into question whether the Template/Pre-Myofibril Model is a viable construct for
understanding sarcomere assembly (Sanger et al., 2005; Sparrow and Scho
¨ck, 2009).
There is further data to suggest that a mechanism other than that described in the Template/Pre-
Myofibril model could be driving sarcomere assembly. This alternative model—called the ‘Stitching
Model’—is based on the idea that parts of a sarcomere are assembled independently and then
brought together (i.e., stitched) (Holtzer et al., 1997; Lu et al., 1992; Sanger et al., 2005). In sup-
port of the Stitching Model, studies in Drosophila have shown the presence of small myosin filaments
following knockdown (KD) of separate Z-line components (Rui et al., 2010). These data suggest that
myosin filaments can assemble independently of Z-lines. Indeed, there are also electron micrographs
that appear to show stacks of myosin II filaments (i.e., A-bands) without detectable actin filaments in
skeletal muscle (Holtzer et al., 1997; Lu et al., 1992; Sanger et al., 2005). Examination of electron
micrographs also supports the idea that bodies containing Z-line components and actin filaments—
called ‘I-Z-I’ bodies—could also exist in skeletal muscle without apparent myosin II filaments
(Holtzer et al., 1997; Lu et al., 1992; Sanger et al., 2005). Based on this data, it was proposed that
stitching could occur through sequential assembly by adding new I-Z-I bodies and myosin II filaments
(Holtzer et al., 1997; Lu et al., 1992; Sanger et al., 2005).
The Template/Pre-Myofibril Model and Stitching Model have been proposed to be mutually
exclusive explanations of how sarcomeres arise. The Template/Pre-Myofibril Model predicts that
multiple sarcomeres will appear approximately simultaneously along the length of a stress fiber,
while the Stitching Model would predict that sarcomeres will appear adjacently one by one, sequen-
tially (see original models in (Dlugosz et al., 1984; Holtzer et al., 1997; Rhee et al., 1994)). Here,
we leverage our discovery that immature human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyo-
cytes (hiCMs) completely disassemble and then reassemble their sarcomeres following plating to
test these possibilities. Using this assay, we show that sarcomeres are assembled directly from actin
stress fiber templates, and we refer to these stress fibers as Muscle Stress Fibers (MSFs). Our data
suggest sarcomere assembly is dependent on the formin actin filament nucleator, FHOD3, non-mus-
cle myosin IIA and non-muscle myosin IIB. Surprisingly, our data do not fully support either the Tem-
plate/Pre-Myofibril Model or Stitching Model, but rather some aspects of each. As such, we now
propose a unified model of sarcomere assembly based on the formation of MSFs and their subse-
quent transition into sarcomere-containing myofibrils.

Development of an assay to test sarcomere assembly
To address how cardiac sarcomeres are assembled, we used hiCMs as a model system (see Materials
and methods) (Takahashi et al., 2007). We first noted the actin filaments in hiCMs, which had
spread for 24 hr, had two distinct organizations, muscle stress fibers (MSFs) and sarcomere-contain-
ing myofibrils (Figure 1B). Spread hiCMs displayed MSFs at the leading edge and organized sarco-
mere structures in the cell body (Figure 1B). Strikingly, super-resolution imaging revealed the MSFs
in hiCMs resembled a classic actin stress fiber found in non-muscle cells, referred to as actin arcs
(Figure 1C and D) (Heath, 1983; Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006). Actin arcs are stress fibers
on the dorsal (top) surface of the cell that are parallel to the leading edge and stain continuously
with fluorescent phalloidin (Figure 1C). Similarly, both MSFs and sarcomeres in hiCMs are on the
dorsal surface (Figure 1B). We next sought to test the concept that a MSF obtained sarcomeres as
predicted by the Templating/Pre-Myofibril Model.
To test whether MSFs give rise to sarcomeres, we needed to develop a sarcomere assembly
assay. We noticed that hiCMs which had been freshly plated (1.5–4 hr post plating) contained no sar-
comeres at either the cell edge or cell body, as visualized by SIM (Figure 1—figure supplement
1A). Loss of sarcomere structure was confirmed by visualizing multiple sarcomeric proteins, including
actin, beta cardiac myosin II (bCMII), a-actinin 2, and TroponinT (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).
Though hiCMs did not contain sarcomeres at early time points post plating, hiCMs did display MSFs
at the cell edge (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). hiCMs subsequently assembled sarcomere
structures over the course of 24 hr (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). We next sought to test if
MSFs template sarcomeres. Indeed, time-lapse
microscopy of hiCMs expressing the actin probe
Lifeact-mEmerald (Riedl et al., 2008) revealed
that MSFs acquire sarcomeres over time, with the
first sarcomeres appearing between 4 and 16 hr
(Figure 1E and F and Video 1). Not surprisingly,
this transition occurs on the dorsal surface of the
cell (Figure 1G). Importantly, to visualize sarco-
mere assembly in live hiCMs, we began our imag-
ing at early time points post plating (i.e., 1.5–4
hr). At these time points, hiCMs do not contain
sarcomeres (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A),
and this ensured we were visualizing the initial
sarcomere assembly event, and not sarcomere
rearrangement or reorganization.
To further characterize our sarcomere assem-
bly assay, we used a-actinin 2, which is a classic
marker of Z-lines (Luther, 2009). Endogenous a-
actinin 2 localized to both MSFs and sarcomeres

 actinin 2 which labeled Z-lines (Figure 2A). As has been shown in other systems (Dabiri et al., 1997;
Du et al., 2008), the spacing between a-actinin 2 puncta increases during the MSF to sarcomere
transition, with the spacing of a-actinin 2 ~ 0.5 mm in MSFs and ~1.7 mm in sarcomeres (Figure 2B).
In hiCMs, a-actinin 2 puncta in MSFs alternates with NMII, as has been shown for other systems (Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 1) (Ehler et al., 1999; Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006; Rhee et al.,
1994; Sanger et al., 2005). Interestingly, the spacing of a-actinin 2 puncta associated with MSFs in
hiCMs was very similar to the spacing of a-actinin 4 (i.e., a non-muscle paralog of a-actinin) in actin
arcs in U2OS cells (Figure 2C). If MSFs were serving as a template for sarcomeres, we asked whether
the a-actinin 2 molecules in MSFs were also being incorporated into the sarcomere structures. Previ-
ous data suggest a-actinin 2 puncta join existing Z-lines (Dabiri et al., 1997; McKenna et al., 1986).
To test this hypothesis, we utilized a photo-convertible probe, tdEOS, which converts from green to
red fluorescence to specifically mark the a-actinin 2 puncta of MSFs (Nienhaus et al., 2006;
Wiedenmann et al., 2004). We found that a subset of photo-converted a-actinin 2-tdEOS puncta
were indeed incorporated into Z-lines (Figure 2D). Collectively, these results strongly suggest MSFs
give rise to sarcomeres in hiCMs.
Actin retrograde flow in hiCMs and non-muscle cells
We next wanted to further investigate the similarities between MSFs and actin arcs. Actin arc stress
fibers in non-muscle cells undergo robust ‘retrograde flow’ away from the edge of the cell as can be
seen in U2OS cells, a classic model of mesenchymal migration (Figure 3A and C) (Hotulainen and

 Lappalainen, 2006; Ponti et al., 2004). Kymography measurements found that actin arcs in U2OS
cells moved at ~200 nm/min, in agreement with previously published findings (Figure 3A and C)
(Ponti et al., 2004). We found MSFs also underwent retrograde flow (Figure 3B and C). Strikingly,
however, kymography revealed MSFs in hiCMs moved significantly slower than actin arcs in U2OS
cells (Figure 3C). This was the first indication that actin arcs in non-muscle cells are different than
MSFs in hiCMs. We next wanted to define the mechanisms governing MSFs and their acquisition of
sarcomeres. As the mechanisms of actin arc formation and maintenance have been well studied
(Burnette et al., 2014; Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006; Murugesan et al., 2016), we were
interested in using our assay to test whether the same mechanisms driving actin arc dynamics were
governing MSF dynamics.
Formins, but not the Arp2/3 complex, are required for MSF-based
sarcomere formation
The Arp2/3 complex is well known to be required for actin arc formation in non-muscle cells
(Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006). To test the role of the Arp2/3 complex during sarcomere
assembly, we allowed hiCMs to spread in the presence of CK666, an inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex
(Nolen et al., 2009). Surprisingly, hiCMs allowed to spread in the presence of CK666 formed robust
MSFs and sarcomeres comparable to untreated control cells (Figure 4A, inset, and 4B). Cells were
quantified as containing sarcomeres if they contained three parallel Z lines in a row each separated
from the adjacent Z line by 1 mm – 2.5 mm. An a-actinin 2 localization was defined as a Z line if it was
as least 2x the length of the microscope’s resolution limit (see Materials and methods). In addition,
the spacing between Z-lines between control and CK666 hiCMs was unchanged (Figure 4C). We
also found the retrograde flow of MSFs was unchanged between control and CK666-treated hiCMs
(Figure 4D and E). To confirm inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex by CK666, we examined the endog-
enous localization of the Arp2/3 complex with and without CK666 treatment. The strong localization
of the Arp2/3 complex at the edge of control hiCMs was absent in CK666 treated hiCMs (Figure 4F
and G). To further confirm this observation, we analyzed the loss of p16b, a subunit of the Arp2/3
complex, from the leading edge of hiCMs via CK666 in live hiCMs. Indeed, hiCMs showed rapid loss
of p16b-mEGFP from the leading edge following administration of CK666 (Figure 4H and I). The
delocalization of the Arp2/3 complex from the leading edge is consistent with inactivation by
CK666, as shown previously in non-muscle cells (Henson et al., 2015). Taken together, our data sug-
gest that the Arp2/3 complex does not need to be localized at the leading edge for sarcomeres to
be assembled.

actin polymerization, small molecule inhibitor of formin homology domain 2, SMIFH2 (Rizvi et al.,
2009). SMIFH2 has been shown to stop formin-mediated actin polymerization, actin arc formation
and retrograde flow in non-muscle cells (Henson et al., 2015; Murugesan et al., 2016; Rizvi et al.,
2009). We found hiCMs spreading in the presence of SMIFH2 completely failed to form sarcomeres
(Figure 5A and B, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). This effect was reversible, as sarcomeres
formed after the removal of SMIFH2 (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Distances between a-actinin
2 structures were also significantly decreased in hiCMs treated with SMIFH2, with the distribution of
a-actinin 2 more closely resembling MSFs than sarcomeres (Figures 5C and 2C). However, the align-
ments of the a-actinin 2 puncta were not similar to MSFs in control hiCMs, as they were not periodic
(Figures 5A and 2A). This result strongly suggested formins are required for sarcomere assembly.
We next asked if formin inhibition was affecting either the MSFs or sarcomeres directly. To test
this, we allowed hiCMs to spread for 24 hr (after they have established sarcomeres) and imaged their
actin cytoskeleton via live-cell microscopy before and after administering SMIFH2 (Figure 5D). Fol-
lowing addition of SMIFH2, formation of new MSFs was immediately blocked, along with retrograde
flow of existing MSFs (Figure 5D–5F). However, we did not detect any changes in sarcomere struc-
ture over the short time of the experiment, and hiCMs continued to beat in the presence of SMIFH2
(note sarcomere structure in Figure 5D). As there are 15 mammalian formin genes, we next asked
what specific formin was required for sarcomere assembly.
We performed RNA sequencing analysis of mRNA isolated from hiCMs. Normalized read counts
revealed that one formin, FHOD3, was expressed higher than all other formins (Figure 6A). Indeed,
previous data from isolated rat cardiomyocytes have shown FHOD3 as crucial for sarcomere mainte-
nance (Iskratsch et al., 2010; Kan-O et al., 2012; Taniguchi et al., 2009). Rat cardiomyocytes con-
taining myofibrils subsequently lost their myofibrils following FHOD3 knockdown (Iskratsch et al.,
2010; Taniguchi et al., 2009). However, the role of FHOD3 during de novo sarcomere assembly has
not been tested. Therefore, we sought to use our assay to directly test if the formin FHOD3 was
required for MSF based sarcomere assembly. We knocked down FHOD3 using siRNA, and hiCMs
were unable to assemble sarcomeres following plating (Figure 6B and C). Interestingly, KD of the
two most highly expressed formins after FHOD3, DAAM1 and DIAPH1, did not stop sarcomere
assembly (Figure 6C and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). However, there are clear defects in the
actin organization at the cell edge and in the sarcomeres (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). As
FHOD3 had the most prominent phenotype, we decided to focus our further analysis on this condi-
tion. In line with pan-formin inhibition, the actin organization and spacing between a-actinin 2 in
FHOD3 KD hiCMs highly resembled hiCMs spread in the presence of SMIFH2 (Figure 5A–5C and
Figure 6B–6D).
Based on our results, if FHOD3 is involved in sarcomere assembly, it should localize to MSFs.
FHOD3-mEGFP localized to both MSFs at the edge of hiCMs, and then becomes increasingly orga-
nized away from the leading edge of the cell where sarcomeres are located (Figure 6E). This locali-
zation is consistent with a role for FHOD3 in mediating the transition from MSFs to sarcomeres.
Taken together, our data show that the formin FHOD3 localizes to both MSFs and sarcomeres, and
is required for de novo sarcomere assembly. We next wanted to investigate other potential mecha-
nisms regulating sarcomere assembly.
Non-muscle myosin II is required for cardiac sarcomere actin filaments
In addition to actin nucleators, non-muscle myosin II (NMII) activity has been shown to be required
for actin arc formation and organization in non-muscle cell types (Hotulainen and Lappalainen,
2006; Medeiros et al., 2006). Thus, we asked whether NMII was required for MSF formation and/or
the MSF to sarcomere transition. We first localized the two major paralogs of NMII in humans, NMIIA
and NMIIB, in spread hiCMs (Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009). Both NMIIA and NMIIB localize to
actin arcs in non-muscle cells (Kolega, 1998). Consistent with this, both NMIIA and NMIIB localized
to MSFs, and were restricted from the middle of the cell where sarcomeres were localized
(Figure 7A and B). Indeed, time-lapse microscopy revealed NMIIA filaments formed at the edge of
hiCMs and underwent retrograde flow as in non-muscle cells (Figure 7C). However, NMIIA remained
at the edge of hiCMs and was restricted from the cell body where sarcomeres are formed
(Figure 7C and Video 2). NMIIB also remained at the edge of hiCMs and was restricted from the

 cell body where sarcomeres are formed (Video 3).
The vast majority of NMIIA and NMIIB filaments
overlapped, except at the very leading edge
where NMIIA is localized slightly ahead of NMIIB
in hiCMs (Figure 7A and B). Super-resolution
microscopy revealed that most NMII filaments
contained NMIIA and NMIIB (Figure 7D). NMIIA
and NMIIB co-filaments have previously been
reported in non-muscle cells (Beach et al., 2014;
Shutova et al., 2014). Measurements of the
lengths of NMII co-filaments in hiCMs showed
lengths agreeing with previously published meas-
urements in non-muscle cells (Figure 7D and E) (Beach et al., 2014; Shutova et al., 2014). Taken
together, these data suggest NMII organization and dynamics appear similar in MSFs of hiCMs as in
actin arcs of non-muscle cells.
Given the presence of both NMIIA and NMIIB in each filament within MSFs, we next asked
whether NMIIA and/or NMIIB were required for sarcomere assembly. NMIIA has previously been
shown to be required for actin arc assembly in non-muscle cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 1)
(Burnette et al., 2014; Fenix et al., 2016). Thus, we hypothesized that NMIIA would likely be the
key paralog required for MSF formation and subsequent sarcomere assembly. Surprisingly, KD of
NMIIA did not result in a complete inhibition of MSF or sarcomere assembly, although the sarco-
meres in NMIIA KD hiCMs were disorganized (Figure 8A–8E and Figure 8—figure supplements 2
and 3). Notably, NMIIA KD hiCMs displayed a similar distribution of distances between a-actinin 2
structures compared to control hiCMs (Figure 8D). This measurement shows that though there are
fewer and more disorganized sarcomeres in the NMIIA KD, their widths as measured from Z-line to
Z-line are similar to control hiCMs. However, NMIIA KD cells had significantly shorter Z-lines com-
pared to control hiCMs (Figure 8E). Taken together, this data suggests NMIIA is involved in sarco-
mere assembly and organization.
It has previously been shown NMIIB is not required for actin arc formation in non-muscle cells
(Kuragano et al., 2018; Shutova et al., 2017) (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). We hypothesized
that NMIIB would not be required for MSFs or sarcomere assembly in hiCMs. Surprisingly, NMIIB KD
resulted in a complete inability of hiCMs to form sarcomeres after plating (Figure 8A–8D and Fig-
ure 8—figure supplements 2 and 4). In addition, the width between a-actinin 2 structures was sig-
nificantly smaller than control hiCMs (Figure 8D). These results argue NMIIB is also a major player
required for sarcomere assembly in hiCMs. To further confirm that myosin II is required for sarco-
mere assembly, we then pharmacologically inhibited all myosin II paralogs in hiCMs with blebbistatin

 (Straight et al., 2003). hiCMs spreading in the presence of blebbistatin were unable to assemble
sarcomere structures (Figure 8—figure supplement 5). While these defects in sarcomere assembly
were dramatic, we noticed that hiCMs treated with siRNA against NMIIA or NMIIB were still beating
before re-plating. This implied that the pre-existing sarcomeres of the hiCMs were still intact after
KD before plating. Therefore, we immuno-localized a-actinin 2 to visualize sarcomeres in hiCMs
before plating. Surprisingly, we found there were no differences between control, NMIIA, and NMIIB
KD cells before plating (Figure 8F and Figure 8—figure supplement 6) Collectively, this data would
suggest NMIIA and NMIIB are required for de novo sarcomere formation, but not homeostasis (i.e.,
turnover) of pre-existing sarcomeres.
NMIIB and FHOD3 are required for organized A-band formation
Thus far, our results highlight the importance of formin-mediated actin polymerization and NMII for
proper actin filament architecture during sarcomere assembly. We next wanted to address how the
thick, b Cardiac Myosin II (bCMII) filaments at the core of the sarcomere (i.e., A-band, Figure 1A)
assemble. Therefore, we started by localizing endogenous bCMII and NMIIB filaments (Figure 9A).
bCMII predominately localized behind NMIIB in organized sarcomere structures and showed a peak
localization ~15 microns behind the leading edge of the cell, with a slight area of overlap with NMIIB
(Figure 9A and B). We noted that the area of overlap contained NMIIB-bCMII co-filaments
(Figure 9C and D, and Figure 9—figure supplement 1). In addition, we also found NMIIA-bCMII
co-filaments in hiCMs (Figure 9—figure supplement 2). To our knowledge, this is the first time a
myosin II filament-species has been reported that contains a non-muscle and muscle paralog inside
cells. Furthermore, we also found NMIIB-bCMII co-filaments in mouse and human heart tissue, indi-
cating NMIIB-bCMII co-filaments are present in vivo (Figure 9C and Figure 9—figure supplement
1). The co-filaments containing NMIIB and bCMII were of similar length to NMIIA/B filaments
(Figure 9D). Indeed, we noticed that near the leading edge of the cell, bCMII filaments are typically
smaller and not organized into stacks resembling A-bands (Figure 9A and C–E). This suggests bCMII
filaments are polymerized at the edge and subsequently grow larger as they move away from the
leading edge (Figure 9E). The presence of NMII before bCMII filaments grow into larger filaments
led us to test the hypothesis that NMII would play a role in bCMII filament formation.
To test if NMIIB was also required for bCMII filament and A-band formation, we depleted hiCMs
of NMIIB and localized bCMII 24 hr after plating. Compared to control hiCMs, NMIIB KD-hiCMs dis-
played a significant decrease in the ability to form A-band-like structures (as defined in the
Materials and methods) and a reduced overall number of bCMII filaments (Figures 9F, G, I and K).
Although bCMII filaments formed, they were highly disorganized compared to control cells, as
assessed by Fourier transform (Pasqualini et al., 2015) (Figure 9G). As the actin puncta left over
after NMIIB KD contained a-actinin 2 (Figure 9H), we hypothesized that these puncta could also be
bound to bCMII filaments. Indeed, we found that bCMII filaments spanned the distance between
closely spaced puncta (Figure 9I). This data suggested that even when the actin cytoskeleton is
severely disrupted, there are still mechanisms leading to the association between it and bCMII fila-
ments. We next sought to expand upon this observation and test whether the observed defects in
bCMII filament assembly in the NMIIB KD hiCMs were caused by the disruption of the actin cytoskel-
eton. To test this, we allowed hiCMs to form sarcomeres for 18 hr, then treated hiCMs with the actin
monomer sequestration agent Latrunculin B for 6 hr (Spector et al., 1983; Wakatsuki et al., 2001).
Previous studies in non-muscle cells have shown that latrunculin treatment clears the actin from most
of the cell and leaves aggregates of actin filaments scattered throughout the cytoplasm
(Ayscough et al., 1997; Gronewold et al., 1999). We also found aggregates of actin filaments in
the periphery of hiCM treated with latrunculin (Figure 9—figure supplement 3). bCMII filaments
appeared to exclusively localize to these aggregates but were not in organized into A-bands
(Figure 11I J). Taken together, these results argue that the organization of actin filaments is a major
factor in the organization of bCMII filaments. As FHOD3 KD also resulted in severely disorganized
actin filament architecture, we localized bCMII in this condition. Indeed, FHOD3 KD hiCM also had
disorganized bCMII filaments compared to control hiCMs (Figure 9—figure supplement 4).
To further investigate the mechanisms of A-band assembly, we created a full length, human
bCMII construct containing a mEGFP tag on the motor domain (i.e., N-terminal) (Figure 11A). This
construct properly integrated into both single filaments and more mature myofibrils (Figure 11A B).
In non-muscle U2OS cells, A-band-like stacks of NMIIA filaments are often formed through a process

 called ‘Expansion’ (Fenix et al., 2016). During Expansion, NMIIA filaments that are close to each
other (i.e., in a tight bundle) move away from each other in space but remain part of the same
ensemble, where they can be aligned in a stack similar to muscle myosin II in the A-band. In addition
to Expansion, NMIIA filaments also, but more rarely, ‘Concatenated’ (Fenix et al., 2016). Concate-
nation is defined by spatially separated NMIIA filaments moving towards one another to create a
stack. To test how bCMII filament stacks form, we repeated our live-cell sarcomere formation assay
using our bCMII-mEGFP construct. In contrast to our previous results with NMIIA, we found the
major physical mechanism of bCMII filament stack formation to be concatenation, where pre-existing
bCMII filaments ran into one another and stitched together to form the A-band (Figure 11C E and
Video 4). A small percentage of hiCMs showed an expansion event of bCMII-mEGFP, however this
was significantly less frequent than in non-muscle cells and did not appear to result in a more orga-
nized A-band (Figure 11D E). Indeed, each of the hiCMs quantified in Figure 11E showed only one
expansion event.
Discussion
The goal of this study was to address a decades-old question concerning the origin of sarcomeres
assembling in cardiomyocytes. A number of labs have proposed sarcomeres arise from a stress
fiber-like precursor, while others propose models where separate sarcomere components sequen-
tially stitch together to form sarcomeres (Holtzer et al., 1997; Lin et al., 1994; Lu et al., 1992;
Rhee et al., 1994; Rui et al., 2010; Sanger et al., 2005). Based on previous actin filament staining
and NMII localization to these stress fibers, our initial hypothesis was that the mechanisms underly-
ing actin filament polymerization and organization would be related to those governing the non-
muscle stress fibers known as actin arcs (see model in Figure 12). In support of this hypothesis, both
previous reports in non-human cardiomyocytes and our own work with hiCMs show that the actin
organization of these precursors appears identical to actin arcs (Heath, 1983; Rhee et al., 1994;
Sanger et al., 2005; Tojkander et al., 2012). Indeed, both MSFs and actin arcs contain NMII, stain
continuously with phalloidin, are on the dorsal surface of the cell, and display retrograde flow in
which they move away from the cell’s edge (Figure 12). However, our study also revealed distinct
differences between the regulation and dynamics of MSFs and actin arcs.
It has been well established that the actin filaments of actin arcs in non-muscle cells require both
nucleation mediated by the Arp2/3 complex and formins (Henson et al., 2015; Hotulainen and Lap-
palainen, 2006; Murugesan et al., 2016). Our data would suggest the Arp2/3 is not formally
required for MSF or sarcomere assembly in hiCMs. However, the Arp2/3 complex is localized to the
edge of hiCMs, and future work will be needed to elucidate its role in cardiac biology. In contrast to
the Arp2/3 complex, our data suggest that formins are required for MSFs and sarcomere assembly.
Specifically, we found the formin FHOD3 has a major role in MSF and sarcomere assembly

 (Figure 12). This adds to the already established role of FHOD3 in sarcomere homeostasis (i.e., turn-
over) (Iskratsch et al., 2010; Kan-O et al., 2012; Taniguchi et al., 2009). Future work will be
required to elucidate the precise mechanism of how and where FHOD3 potentially nucleates actin
filaments in sarcomeres. Canonical sarcomeric actin filaments have their barbed ends embedded
within a Z-line (see schematic in Figure 1A). As such, this is where we would have predicted FHOD3
would localize. However, our SIM data show that FHOD3 does not localize to Z lines (Figure 6F,
boxes 4, 5 and 6). Instead, FHOD3 appears to localize on either side of each Z-line. This could indi-
cate that FHOD3 is only transiently associated with the barbed ends of canonical sarcomeric actin fil-
aments. Alternatively, there could barbed ends of actin filaments in this region, which could indicate
that the organization and/or dynamics of actin filaments within a sarcomere is more complex. Finally,
while FHOD3 KD displayed the most severe phenotype, KD of DAAM1 and DIAPH1 in hiCMs
resulted in both sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric defects in actin architecture. This agrees with previ-
ous literature showing roles for multiple formins in explanted mouse cardiomyocytes in maintenance
of sarcomere structure (Rosado et al., 2014). The diverse roles of formins during sarcomere assem-
bly and subsequent maintenance should be explored in future work.
We also show that NMIIA and NMIIB are required for proper sarcomere assembly in our hiCM
model system. Interestingly, our data suggest that each motor may be playing a different role(s) in

 sarcomere assembly. NMIIB KD resulted in no
detectable sarcomere assembly (Figure 8 and
Figure 8—figure supplement 4), suggesting that
NMIIB could be required for the initial and possi-
bly subsequent steps of assembly. On the other
hand, NMIIA KD hiCMs were able to assemble
sarcomeres, although these were wispy with sig-
nificantly shorter Z-lines (Figure 8 and Figure 8—
figure supplement 3). This NMIIA KD-phenotype
could be a result of several possibilities including
a role of NMIIA in sarcomere maturation, align-
ment, or stability. Obviously, this is not an
exhaustive list of potential mechanisms. In addi-
tion to showing NMIIA and NMIIB were required
for sarcomere assembly, we show NMIIA and
NMIIB form myosin II co-filaments with bCMII.
bCMII filaments found in co-filaments were rela-
tively small, (~300 nm), and subsequently grew
larger as they transitioned to the larger filaments
of the A-band (~1.6 microns), and lost NMII. Indi-
vidual bCMII filaments (or a small bundle below
the resolution limit of our imaging modality) con-
catenate to form the bCMII filament stacks of the
A-band. This process requires the presence of
actin tracks (Figure 12).
Collectively, our data provide new mechanistic
and dynamic insight surrounding sarcomere assembly, and highlights key differences between clas-
sic, well-studied non-muscle stress fibers, and MSFs in cardiac myocytes (Figure 12). In addition, our
model unifies certain aspects of previously proposed models of sarcomere assembly (Figure 12).
These previously proposed models, while presented as mutually exclusive from one another, are
actually quite similar in certain respects. Highlighting this, our data support a major feature shared
between the Template Model and Pre-Myofibril Model. Specifically, that stress fibers are precursors
to sarcomere containing myofibrils. These stress fibers were originally called ‘stress fiber-like struc-
tures’ when the Template Model was proposed (Dlugosz et al., 1984; Sanger et al., 2005). Later,
they were renamed to Pre-Myofibrils in lieu of more thorough characterization (Rhee et al., 1994;
Sanger et al., 2005). It was shown these stress fibers did not contain the same proteins as non-mus-
cle stress fibers (Rhee et al., 1994). However, most of the known proteins in stress fibers found in
cardiomyocytes have paralogs in non-muscle stress fibers. As such, we find ‘stress fiber-like struc-
tures’ an apt description. Therefore, we suggest simply calling these structures ‘stress fibers’ is pref-
erable. In this study, we are comparing regulatory mechanisms of the non-muscle stress fiber
referred to as actin arcs, to sarcomere precursors in cardiac myocytes. Thus, we decided to call them
Muscle Stress Fibers (MSFs) to avoid confusion.
Our data support the concept that MSFs transition into sarcomere-containing myofibrils over
time. This is the way the cartoon models of both the Template and Pre-Myofibril Models are pre-
sented (see original models (Dlugosz et al., 1984; Rhee et al., 1994)). An open question remains as
to whether there is true templating during this process. The original Template Model posited that
‘stress fiber-like structures’ [MSFs] would disappear after they were used as a template to build a
myofibril (Dlugosz et al., 1984). While some components of MSFs (e.g., a-actinin 2) do appear to
persist during the MSF to sarcomere transition, others clearly do not (e.g., NMIIA/B). Furthermore,
our data suggest that NMIIA/B filaments could be themselves a template for the addition of bCMII
as all three paralogs can be found in co-filaments together in the region where NMIIA/B and bCMII
overlap. In addition to the Templating/Pre-myofibril Models, our data also support aspects of the
Stitching Model. The Stitching Model originally proposed that pre-assembled components of the
sarcomere (i.e., A-bands and I-Z-I bodies) would stitch together sequentially to form a myofibril
(Holtzer et al., 1997). We did not detect pre-formed I-Z-I bodies or A-bands in our assay (Figure 1—
figure supplement 1) or sequential assembly of sarcomeres to form a myofibril (Figure 1). However,

 Figure 12. Model of actomyosin stress fiber formation in non-muscle cells and human cardiomyocytes. (A) Actin and myosin II stress fiber formation in
non-muscle cells. Actin stress fibers are formed via the Arp2/3 complex and the formin mDia1. NMIIA is the predominant isoform at the leading edge
of non-muscle cells, and stress fiber formation is NMIIA dependent. Non-muscle cells display robust retrograde flow of actin stress fibers and display
rapid turnover. Large NMIIA stacks are formed via growth and expansion of smaller NMIIA filaments. Citations leading to this model are presented in

 certain aspects of bCMII dynamics warrant comparison to the Stitching Model. We found separate
bCMII filaments concatenated and ‘stitched’ together to form larger bCMII filament stacks (i.e., the
A-band) (Figure 11C).
Our data show the transition of a MSF to a sarcomere-containing myofibril occurs on the dorsal
(top) surface of the cell. However, a recent study also imaging iPSC derived cardiac myocytes claims
that sarcomeres are formed on the ventral (bottom) surface of the cell near extracellular matrix adhe-
sions (Chopra et al., 2018). This group also report that the first sarcomeres forms between 24–
and 48 hr after plating, well after we detect the first sarcomeres appearing (Chopra et al., 2018).
This led us to question what could be leading to these two seemingly opposite results. Importantly,
it appears that this group was imaged the ventral (bottom) surface of their myocytes, as the focus of
their study was on focal adhesions. Close inspection of their time-lapse movies revealed faint and
blurred structures corresponding to sarcomeric patterns that show up in the frame right before the
appearance of sarcomeres. This supports the notion that they are imaging sarcomeres that are com-
ing into focus, and not assembling ‘de novo’. To test this idea, we imaged hiCMs with 3D confocal
microscopy after they had been plated for 24 hr (Figure 12—figure supplement 1). While we also
see similar patterns of sarcomeres appearing on the ventral surface as (Chopra et al., 2018), our
data revealed these sarcomeres are moving down from the dorsal surface and not assembling on
the ventral surface (Figure 12—figure supplement 1 and Video 5). Of interest, the phenomenon of
actin arcs moving down to the ventral surface of non-muscle cells has also been reported previously
(Gao et al., 2012; Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006). Finally, (Chopra et al., 2018) also claim that
neither NMIIA nor NMIIB are required for sarcomere assembly. We also find this strange. While their
double NMIIA/NMIIB knockout (KO) cardiomyocyte cell line has a-actinin 2 positive structures, they
do not contain continuous labeled Z-lines aligned parallel to each other comparable to the control
cell line. The authors did not measure Z-line lengths, spacing, or other criteria needed to define sar-
comeres. These discrepancies between our study and theirs, including the role of NMII, need to be
harmonized, as it will directly affect our interpre-
tation of future in vivo data concerning sarco-
mere assembly.

fibers. Both NMIIA and NMIIB are localized to the edge of hiCMs, and display prominent NMII co-filaments. NMIIB-bCMII co-filaments are also present
with MSFs. Large bCMII filament stacks form via concatenation and stitching of individual bCMII filaments.

 increased NMIIA protein levels compared to controls (Tullio et al., 1997). Thus, the observed capac-
ity of this animal to form sarcomere like structures could be due to genetic compensation by NMIIA.
A conditional KO NMIIB mouse has also been made (Ma et al., 2009). While the authors showed an
impressive NMIIB KD in the cerebellum via a neuronal specific driver, there were high levels of NMIIB
protein in the heart at the time of analysis in the heart specific KO (Ma et al., 2009). In addition, the
heart specific conditional KO is driven off of the alpha myosin heavy chain promoter, which switches
on after sarcomere assembly has begun and indeed after the heart fields have begun to beat
(Ma et al., 2009; Ng et al., 1991). Complicating the issue further, NMIIB has been difficult to local-
ize in tissue. We believe this to be a result of paraffin embedding and subsequent paraffin removal
and rehydration protocols. For example, we successfully localized NMIIB in formalin fixed human
and mouse tissue (Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1), but failed to localize NMIIB in par-
affin embedded tissue. Future comparisons between in vivo and in vitro data sets will need to be
addressed.
Intriguing and unanswered questions also remain to be tested. For example, how are the
observed gradients of NMII and bCMII in cardiac myocytes established and maintained? Such ques-
tions have been previously difficult to impossible to test due complicated and technically challenging
model systems. Here, we present a relatively easy to use model system to test these questions. The
hiCMs we use in this study are commercially available. Our Methods outline protocols to transfect
with DNA for protein expression and siRNA for protein knockdown, and trypsinization protocols for
re-plating. Going forward, we believe studies using the experimental setup we describe here will not
only continue to clarify previous models but also reveal new insights into both sarcomere assembly,
and cardiac cell biology.

Experimental model and subject details
Cell line growth and experimental conditions
Human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiCMs) were purchased from either Axiogene-
sis (Cor.4u, Ncardia Cologne, Germany) or Cellular Dynamics International (iCell caridomyocytes2,
Madison, WI). Cells were cultured as per manufacturer’s instructions. hiCMs were cultured in 96 well
plates and maintained in proprietary manufacturer provided media until ready for experimental use.
Knockdown experiments in hiCMs were started 4 days after the initial thaw. See Plating Assay for
more detailed protocol for cell plating. See below for detailed information on protein transfection
and siRNA mediated knockdown
U-2 OS and HeLa cells (HTB-96; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) cells were cul-
tured in 25 cm2 cell culture flasks (25-207; Genessee Scientific Corporation, San Diego, CA) with
growth medium comprising DMEM (10–013-CV; Mediatech, Manassas, VA) containing 4.5 g/L L-glu-
tamine, D-glucose, and sodium pyruvate and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (F2442;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For protein expression experiments in U-2 OS cells, cells were tran-
siently transfected with FuGENE 6 (E2691; Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Knockdown of NMIIA and NMIIB was performed as previously, with the Accell SMART-
pool siRNA to human MYH9, MYH10 or Accell scrambled control purchased from Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific (Waltham, MA) in combination with Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (cat#
11668027, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for HeLa cells. For both live and fixed cell micros-
copy, cells were plated and imaged on 35 mm glass bottom dishes with a 10 mm micro-well #1.5
cover glass (Cellvis, Mountain View, CA) coated with 25 mg/mL laminin (114956-81-9, Sigma-Aldrich).
Plasmids

 encoding Lifeact-mEmerald and Lifeact-mApple were gifts from Michael Davidson. Plasmid encoding
NMIIB-(N-terminal)-mEmerald was purchased from Addgene (54192; Addgene, Cambridge, MA).
The plasmid encoding a-actinin 2-tdEOS was purchased from Addgene (57577; Addgene, Cam-
bridge, MA). Plasmid encoding human bCMII was synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Briefly, the wild-type human MYH7 (bCMII) sequence from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI, Bethesda, MD, USA) was cloned into a pUC57 along with Gateway DNA recom-
bination sequences in order to facilitate rapid fluorescent protein integration and swapping (Gate-
way Technology, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). mEGFP containing a previously published
linker sequence was added to the bCMII plasmid using Gateway Vector Conversion System with
One Shot ccdB Survival Cells (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for the bCMII-(N-terminal)-
mEGFP construct used in this study. FHOD3-mEGFP plasmid lacking the T(D/E)5XE exon was a gift
from Elizabeth Ehler. This construct has previously been shown to localize to sarcomeres in neonatal
rat cardiomyocytes (Iskratsch et al., 2010) (see top left panel of Figure 2A in reference). Assembling
pHalo-NMHC IIB-C18: pEmerald-NMHC IIB-C18 (Addgene, #54192) was the kind gift of Michael
Davidson. Halo tag cDNA was PCR amplified from pHalo-N1 and subcloned into the Age I/BspEI
mEmerald site of pEmerald-NMHC IIB-C18, replacing mEmerald, to generate the sequence verified
pHalo-NMHC IIB-C18 construct. Assembling pHalo-NMHC IIA-C18 (NMIIA-HaLo): The NheI/BspEI
Halo cDNA fragment from the pHalo-NMHC IIB-C18 construct was subcloned into the NheI/BspEI
mEmerald site of pEmerald-NMHC IIA-C18 (Addgene, #54190) (Burnette et al., 2014), replacing
mEmerald, to generate the sequence verified pHalo-NMHC IIA-C18 construct. The pEGFP-p16b
plasmid (to visualize the Arp2/3 complex) was a gift from Dr. Pekka Lappalainen and previously pub-
lished (Koestler et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2008).
Halo-tag Labeling
hiCM expressing Halo-tag constructs were labeled with JF Dye 585 at 1:100 dilution in pre-warmed
culture medium for 1 hr. The plate was then washed by gently exchanging with fresh medium 3
times (Grimm et al., 2017; Grimm et al., 2015)
Cell line authentication
The HeLa cell line used in this study was a gift of Dr. DA Weitz (Harvard University). The Burnette lab
had this line authenticated by Promega and ATCC using their ‘Cell Line Authentication Service’ in
2015. The methods and test results received from Promega and ATCC are as follows:
“Methodology: Seventeen short tandem repeat (STR) loci plus the gender determining locus,
Amelogenin, were amplified using the commercially available PowerPlex 18D Kit from Promega. The
cell line sample was processed using the ABI Prism 3500xl Genetic Analyzer. Data were analyzed
using GeneMapper ID-X v1.2 software (Applied Biosystems). Appropriate positive and negative con-
trols were run and confirmed for each sample submitted.’
“Data Interpretation: Cell lines were authenticated using Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis as

Live-Cell sarcomere assembly visualization assay
To visualize sarcomere formation, we developed a repeatable method, which can be used to visual-
ize any fluorescently tagged protein during sarcomere formation in hiCMs. Prior to performing this
assay, cells are maintained in desired culture vessel (our hiCMs were maintained in 96 well plates). In
this assay, cells are transiently transfected with desired fluorescently tagged protein, trypsinized,
plated on desired imaging dish, and imaged to observe sarcomere formation. A sarcomere assembly
assay proceeds as follows. First, hiCMs are transfected with desired fluorescently tagged protein as
described below (Viafect, overnight transfection). Transfection mix is washed out with culture media.
Cells are then detached from culture vessel using trypsinization method described below. Cells are

 then plated on a desired culture vessel (in this study, 10 mm #1.5 glass bottom dishes were used,
CellVis, Mountain View, CA) for live cell imaging. Imaging vessels were pre-coated with 25 mg/mL
laminin for 1 hr at 37˚ C and washed with 1x PBS containing no Mg2+/Ca2+. Cells were allowed to
attach for ~1.5 hr and media was added to fill the glass bottom dish. Cells were then imaged using
desired imaging modality at 3–6 hr post plating. The 3–6 hr time window was optimal, as cells had
not yet established sarcomeres, but were healthy enough to tolerate fluorescence imaging. This
powerful assay can be adapted to visualize the kinetics during sarcomere formation of any fluores-
cently tagged protein. We have used this assay to visualize actin (Lifeact), FHOD3, bCMII, a-actinin
2, NMIIA, and NMIIB. The latter two proteins being large (i.e.,>250 KD).
Trypsinization of hiCMs
To trypsinize Cellular Dynamics hiCMs, manufacturers recommendations were used, as follows. All
volumes apply were modified from 24 well format for 96 well plates. hiCMs were washed 2x with
100 uL 1x PBS with no Ca2+/Mg2+ (PBS*). PBS* was completely removed from hiCMs and 40 uL
0.1% Trypsin-EDTA with no phenol red (Invitrogen) was added to hiCMs and placed at 37˚ C for 2
min. Following incubation, culture dish was washed 3x with trypsin inside well, rotated 180 degrees,
and washed another 3x. Trypsinization was then quenched by adding 160 mL of culture media and
total cell mixture was placed into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Cells were spun at 1000gs for 5 min,
and supernatant was aspirated. Cells were then re-suspended in 200 uL of culture media and plated
on a 10 mm glass bottom dish pre-coated with 25 mg/mL laminin for 1 hr. Cells were then allowed to
attach for at least 1 hr, and 2–3 mLs of culture media with or without drug was added to cells.
To trypsinize Axiogenesis hiCMs, manufacturers recommendations were used, as follows. Cells
were washed 2x with 500 mL PBS*. Cells were placed in 37˚ C incubator for 7 min in PBS*. Following
7 min, PBS* was aspirated and 40 mL 0.5% Trypsin (Invitrogen) was placed on cells for 3 min in 37˚ C
incubator. Following 3 min, 160 mL full Cor.4u media was used to quench trypsinization and re-sus-
pend cells. Cells were then plated on pre-coated glass bottom dish and media added 1.5 hr later to
dilute trypsin and fill chamber. Note* this trypsinization protocol has since been modified by Axio-
genesis (now Ncardia). See manufacturer for new protocol.
It is important to note that the trypsinization protocol is based off of the hiCMs manufacturers
protocols for cell plating, and these hiCMs have been trypsinized prior to functional assays of cardio-
myocyte performance and characterization (e.g., drug response, electro-physiology, maturation,
etc. . .) (Fine et al., 2013; Ivashchenko et al., 2013; Mioulane et al., 2012).
Transient transfection of hiCMs
Cellular Dynamics hiCMs were transfected via modification of manufacturer’s recommendations as
follows. Volumes used are for transfection in 96 well plates. 2 mL of total 200 ng plasmid (containing
fluorescently tagged protein of interest, diluted in Opti-MEM) and 2 mL 1:5 diluted Viafect (Promega,
E4981, in Opti-MEM) was added to 6 mL Opti-MEM. Entire mixture of 10 mL was added to single 96
well of hiCMs containing freshly exchanged 100 mL full culture media. Transfection was allowed to
go overnight (~15 hr), and washed 2x with full culture media. For transfection of multiple probes, 2
mL of 200 ng plasmid was used for each probe together with 4 mL 1:5 diluted Viafect, into 2 mL Opti-
MEM and mixture was applied to cells as above.
Axiogenesis hiCMs were transfected via modification of manufacturer’s recommendations as fol-
lows. A 3.5:1 Fugene to DNA ratio was used to transfect Axiogenesis hiCMs. 1.2 mL Fugene +0.33
mg DNA per 96 well into 5 mL serum free Cor.4u media was incubated for 15 min at room tempera-
ture. 95 mL full Cor.4u media was added to mixture and entire mixture was added to hiCMs (on top
of 100 mL already in well). For transfection of 2 separate plasmids, 3.5:1 ratio was used for both plas-
mids and additional volume was subtracted from 95 mL dilution. Note* this transfection protocol has
since been modified by Axiogenesis. See manufacturer for new protocol.
Protein knockdown
Cellular Dynamics hiCMs were used for knockdown experiments via modification of manufacturers
recommendations. Volumes used are for siRNA application in 96 well plates. Dharmacon SmartPool
siRNA (GE Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) targeted to MYH9 (NMIIA), MYH10 (NMIIB), FHOD3,
DAAM1,
and
DIAPH1
were
used

 E-012925-00-0005, and E-010347-00-0005, respectively). To achieve KD, a master mixture of 100 ml
Opti-MEM (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA)+4 ml Transkit-TKO (Mirus Bio, Madison WI)+5.5 ml 10 mM
siRNA was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 80 ml of fresh, pre-warmed media was added
to hiCMs. Following incubation of siRNA mixture, 8.3 ml of mixture was added to each individual
well of 96 well plate. hiCMs were then incubated for 2 days at 37˚ C. hiCMs were then washed 2x
with fresh, pre-warmed media. To achieve KD of NMIIA, NMIIB, FHOD3, DAAM1, and DIAPH1, 3
rounds of siRNA mediated KD described above were necessary. Following 3 rounds of scramble con-
trol siRNA treatment, hiCMs still beat and maintained sarcomere structure (see Figure 8—figure
supplement 6).
Pharmacological experiments
For all pharmacological experiments, drugs were added to pre-warmed and equilibrated media
before adding to hiCMs. For sarcomere assembly assays, 25 mM SMIFH2 (Sigma-Aldrich, S4826), 25
mM CK666 (Sigma-Aldrich, SML0006), and 100 mM Blebbistatin (Sigma-Aldrich, B0560) (separately)
were added 1.5 hr after plating to allow hiCMs to attach to the substrate. hiCMs were subsequently
fixed (see below) at 24 hr post plating. For live-cell experiments (as in Figure 5D), media in imaging
container was aspirated using a vacuum system, and media containing drug was added to hiCMs on
the microscope stage. This allowed the same hiCM to be imaged pre and post-drug application. For
the LatrunculinB experiment (Figure 9J), cells were allowed to spread for 18 hr in normal media, and
media containing 5 mM LatrunculinB (Sigma-Aldrich, L5288) was added for 6 hr and hiCMs were
fixed (for a total spreading time of 24 hr).
Western blotting
Gel samples were prepared by mixing cell lysates with LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies,
#NP0007) and Sample Reducing Buffer (Life Technologies, #NP00009) and boiled at 95˚C for 5 min.
Samples were resolved on Bolt 4–12% gradient Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies, #NW04120BOX).
Protein bands were blotted onto a nylon membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked using 5% NFDM
(Research Products International Corp, Mt. Prospect, IL, #33368) in TBST. Antibody incubations were
also performed in 5% NFDM in TBST. Blots were developed using the Immobilon Chemilumines-
cence Kit (Millipore, #WBKLS0500).
Fixation and immunohistochemistry
hiCMs and HeLa cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at room temperature for
20 min and then extracted for 5 min with 1% Triton X-100% and 4% PFA in PBS as previously
described (Burnette et al., 2014). Cells were washed three times in 1 � PBS. To visualize endoge-
nous bCMII and transfected proteins in fixed cells, hiCMs were live-cell extracted before fixation as
described previously to reduce background and non-cytoskeletal myosin II filaments (i.e., the soluble
pool). Briefly, a cytoskeleton-stabilizing live-cell extraction buffer was made fresh containing 2 ml of
stock solution (500 mM 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, 25 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid,
25 mM MgCl2), 4 ml of 10% polyoxyethylene glycol (PEG; 35,000 molecular weight), 4 ml H2O, and
100 ml of Triton X-100, 10 mM paclitaxel, and 10 mM phalloidin. Cells were treated with this extrac-
tion buffer for 1 min, followed by a 1 min wash with wash buffer (extraction buffer without PEG or
Triton X-100). Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min. After fixation, the following labeling
procedures were used: for actin visualization, phalloidin-488 in 1 � PBS (15 ml of stock phalloidin per
200 ml of PBS) was used for 3 hr at room temperature. For immunofluorescence experiments, cells
were blocked in 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted in 10%
BSA. NMIIA antibody (BioLegend, P909801) was used at 1:1000. NMIIB antibody (Cell Signaling,
3404S and BioLegend 909901) were used at 1:200. bCMII antibody (Iowa Hybridoma Bank, A4.1025)
was used undiluted from serum. a-actinin 2 (Sigma-Aldrich, clone EA-53) antibody was used at
1:200. FHOD3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, G-5, sc-374601) was used at 1:100. Arp2/3 anti-
body (Anti-p34-Arc/ARPC2, Millipore Sigma, 07–227) was used at 1:100. DAAM1 antibody (Bethyl
Laboratories, A300-078A) was used at 1:100. DIAPH1 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA026605) was
used at 1:100. Cardiac Troponin T antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CT3, sc-20025) was used at
200 mg/ml. Secondary antibodies were diluted in 10% BSA at 1:100 and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm
for 10 min before use. Cells were imaged in VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Media with DAPI (H-

 1200, VECTOR LABORATORIES, Burlingame, CA, USA). To label both NMIIA and NMIIB in the same
sample (as in Figure 7A), NMIIA primary antibody was directly labeled using a primary antibody
labeling kit from Biotium (Mix-n-Stain CF Antibody Labeling Kits, Biotium, Inc. Fremont, CA). Follow-
ing manufacturers protocol, NMIIA was primary labeled, and stain was visually compared to standard
immunofluorescence protocol (see above) to validate localization pattern.
RNA-seq data analysis
RNA-seq reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013)
and quantified by featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014). Read counts were normalized by the Relative
Log Expression (RLE) method and FPKM values for each sample were generated by DESeq2
(Love et al., 2014).
Structured illumination microscopy
Two SIM microscopes were used in this study (individual experiments were always imaged using the
same microscope). SIM imaging and processing was performed on a GE Healthcare DeltaVision
OMX equipped with a 60�/1.42 NA oil objective and sCMOS camera at room temperature. SIM
imaging and processing was also performed on a Nikon N-SIM structured illumination platform
equipped with an Andor DU-897 EMCCD camera and a SR Apo TIRF (oil) 100 � 1.49 NA WD 0.12
objective at room temperature.
Spinning disk microscopy
Spinning disk confocal images were taken on a Nikon Spinning Disk equipped with a Yokogawa
CSU-X1 spinning disk head, Andor DU-897 EMCCD camera and 100x Apo TIRF (oil) 1.49 NA WD
0.12 mm objective at 37 degrees C and 5%CO2.
Laser-scanning confocal microscopy
Laser-scanning confocal images were taken on a Nikon A1R laser scanning equipped with a 60x/1.40
Plan Apo Oil objective at 37 degrees C and 5%CO2. Confocal images for Figure 9C (in vivo, right)
and Figure 9—figure supplement 1C-D were taken on a Zeiss 880 with AiryScan equipped with a
63x/1.40 Plan-Apochromat Oil objective at room temperature.
Wide-field microscopy
Wide-field images were taken on a high-resolution wide-field Nikon Eclipse Ti equipped with a
Nikon 100x Plan Apo 1.45 NA oil objective and a Nikon DS-Qi2 CMOS camera. Data presented
in Figure 8—figure supplement 6 was acquired on an Essen Incucyte S3 (Ann Arbor, MI) Live-Cell
Analysis system with the 20x objective. Photo-conversion experiments were performed as previously
described (Fenix et al., 2016).
Quantification and statistical analysis
Sarcomere assembly quantification
To quantify percent of hiCMs with sarcomeres (i.e., Figure 4B), the actin cytoskeleton (via fluores-
cently labeled phalloidin) was imaged using structured illumination microscopy. hiCMs were quanti-
fied as containing sarcomere structures if they contained at least one myofibril containing at least 3
Z-discs (bright phalloidin staining which overlaps with a-actinin 2 staining as in Figure 4A)
spaced ~1.5–2 mm apart. By these metrics our quantification of sarcomere formation is not a mea-
sure of sarcomere maturity or alignment, but a measure of the hiCMs ability to assemble the build-
ing blocks of the sarcomere (i.e., the thin actin filaments) in response to a perturbation. Thus, while
NMIIA KD hiCMs clearly form unaligned, disorganized, and fewer sarcomeres and myofibrils than
control hiCMs, they still maintain the ability to assemble sarcomere structures, which is reflected in
our quantification (Figure 8A and C). In the same vein, we realize our quantification is a very liberal
quantification of sarcomere assembly. While we don’t expect a small array of sarcomeres to repre-
sent a functionally capable cardiomyocyte, we are investigating the early steps of sarcomere assem-
bly and the ability of hiCMs to form the basic actin-myosin structure of the sarcomere.

 b cardiac myosin II (bCMII) filament and stack quantification
A similar methodology was used to quantify bCMII A-band filament stacks using endogenous bCMII
staining and SIM instead of the actin cytoskeleton. A bCMII filament was quantified as the minimum
SIM resolvable bCMII unit which had a bipolar organization (a filament with motor domains on each
side), as represented in Figure 11A. hiCMs were quantified as containing bCMII A-band filament
stacks if they contained even one bCMII filament stack in the cell. A bCMII filament stack was defined
as being thicker than the minimum SIM resolvable bCMII filament, indicating multiple SIM resolvable
bCMII filaments. Indeed, by this metric, bCMII filament stacks have more resolvable ‘motor-domains’
than bCMII filaments.
For actin arc and MSF retrograde flow rates (as in Figure 3), 3 regions of interest (ROIs) were
used per cell. ROIs were drawn using the line tool in FIJI starting from in front of the leading edge
(to ensure new MSF formation was captured) to the cell body where sarcomere structures were local-
ized. ROIs were then used to measure MSF translocation rates using the kymograph tool (line
width = 3) on hiCMs which had been aligned using StackReg function. Kymographs generated in
this manner were then manually measured by counting pixels on the X axis (distance) and the Y axis
(time) for a distance/time measurement resulting in translocation rates. This method is similar to pre-
viously described methods of actin arc translocation in non-muscle cells.
To measure distance between a-actinin 2 structures, the line tool and measure tool in FIJI (Fiji is
Just ImageJ) was used. Lines were drawn, positions recorded (using ROI tool), and distances mea-
sured between a-actinin 2 structures. Multiple regions per cell for a-actinin 2 in MSFs, and whole
cells for distances between sarcomeres were used.
To measure Z-line sizes in hiCMs, the line tool and measure tool in FIJI was used. Lines were
drawn on individual Z-lines and their positions were recorded using the ROI tool. This gave a mea-
surement of Z-line size and position within the cell. For Z-line measurements, such as Figure 8E, all
Z-lines which could be reliably measured were measured.
Immunofluorescence localization quantification
To quantify localization of NMIIA, NMIIB, and bCMII, line scans starting from the edge of the cell
were taken for every cell and the normalized average localizations were used to average the number
of indicated experiments for the final localization patterns depicted in the graph (as in Figure 7B).
To quantify Arp2/3 intensity, a similar but altered strategy was taken. four separate boxes for
each cell were placed along the edge of the cell (i.e., the lamellipodium) using the actin channel for
guidance. These boxes were then used to measure average intensity of the anti-p34 channel (i.e.,
the Arp2/3 complex). Background subtracted averages for each cell in control and CK666 treated
hiCMs were used to quantify percent decrease as depicted in Figure 4F.
Cells used for this study
In order to have comparable results, cells used for this study were standardized based on morphol-
ogy. Specifically, spread non-muscle cells and hiCMs with a broad leading edge and lamella were
chosen as previously shown in studies of both non-muscle and muscle contractile system formation
(Burnette et al., 2014; Rhee et al., 1994). This also facilitated the ability to observe the MSF to sar-
comere transition in live hiCMs, and is recommended for future studies investigating sarcomere
assembly. All experiments measuring sarcomere assembly were conducted at least 3 times, sepa-
rately, and cells were imaged using SIM. Though this results in a relatively small number of cells for
some of the experiments, we believe super-resolution imaging modalities such as SIM offer invalu-
able insight into sarcomere assembly (Gustafsson, 2005). Indeed, sub-diffraction imaging is
required to reliably localize myosin II co-filaments both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, as has been
seen in Drosophila, even high-resolution imaging modalities such as laser-scanning confocal micros-
copy are not sufficient to detect subtle, yet important, structural changes in response to perturba-
tion (Fernandes and Scho
¨ck, 2014).
Statistics
Statistical significance was calculated using 2-tailed, unpaired Students T-tests performed in Excel.
All independent experiments represent biological replicates. Error bars in all graphs represent stan-
dard error of the mean (SEM). For all graphs depicting % of cells (for example, Figure 1D), number

 of cells and experiments is indicated in figure legend. Percents displayed represent the average of
the averages of the all experiments performed. For example, if controls cells displayed 95%, 90%,
and 100% of all cells displaying actin arcs in three separate experiments, the represented percent-
age in the graph would be 95%. SEM was calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the
square root of the number of separate experiments. For actin translocation rates at least three meas-
urements per cell were used to calculate the average translocation rates per cell. Translocation rates
were then calculated in same manner as described above. Line-scan graphs represent normalized
relative fluorescence.
