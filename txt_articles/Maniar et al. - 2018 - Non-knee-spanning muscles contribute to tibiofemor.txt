Non-knee-spanning muscles 
contribute to tibiofemoral shear 
as well as valgus and rotational 
joint reaction moments during 
unanticipated sidestep cutting

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are a burdensome condition due to potential surgical 
requirements and increased risk of long term debilitation. Previous studies indicate that muscle forces 
play an important role in the development of ligamentous loading, yet these studies have typically 
used cadaveric models considering only the knee-spanning quadriceps, hamstrings and gastrocnemius 
muscle groups. Using a musculoskeletal modelling approach, we investigated how lower-limb muscles 
produce and oppose key tibiofemoral reaction forces and moments during the weight acceptance phase 
of unanticipated sidestep cutting. Muscles capable of opposing (or controlling the magnitude of) the 
anterior shear force and the external valgus moment at the knee are thought to be have the greatest 
potential for protecting the anterior cruciate ligament from injury. We found the best muscles for 
generating posterior shear to be the soleus, biceps femoris long head and medial hamstrings, providing 
up to 173N, 111N and 77N of force directly opposing the anterior shear force. The valgus moment was 
primarily opposed by the gluteus medius, gluteus maximus and piriformis, with these muscles providing 
contributions of up to 32 Nm, 19 Nm and 21 Nm towards a knee varus moment, respectively. Our 
findings highlight key muscle targets for ACL preventative and rehabilitative interventions.
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a burdensome condition due to potential surgical requirements, sub-
stantial convalescence and rehabilitation time1, and associated financial costs to individuals and the healthcare 
system2. ACL injury has also been shown to be associated with an increased risk of early onset knee osteoarthritis, 
especially if accompanied by meniscal injury3. Consequently, knowledge regarding the mechanical factors related 
to ACL injury and injury risk are needed to develop effective prophylactic strategies.
Whilst the primary role of the ACL is to resist anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur4, both 
cadaveric and modelling studies have shown that frontal and transverse plane knee mechanics can also influence 
ACL loading5–8. In the frontal plane, a greater ‘external’ knee valgus or varus moment has the potential to increase 
load on the ACL5,8. However, knee valgus has been reported to be the more common mechanism of injury in 
video analysis studies9–11. In the transverse plane, an ‘external’ moment causing internal rotation of the tibia with 
respect to the femur has been found to expose the ACL to higher loads than an ‘external’ moment causing exter-
nal rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur5,8. Moreover, non-sagittal plane knee joint moments have been 
shown to have the greatest influence on ACL loading when they occur simultaneously and especially in conjunc-
tion with an anterior shear force5,7,8,12. A better understanding regarding the development of these critical knee 
joint loads could therefore be beneficial for improving ACL preventative and rehabilitative strategies.
Muscles produce forces that can cause and oppose these critical knee joint loads. For example, the quadriceps 
generates an anterior tibiofemoral shear force which is directly opposed by the ACL13. In contrast, the hamstrings 
have the potential to mitigate anterior tibiofemoral shear forces thereby working with the ACL to control the

amount of anterior translation at the knee joint13,14. Despite the amount of research completed to date, existing 
knowledge regarding biomechanical variables associated with high loading of the ACL is still quite limited. No 
studies have investigated which muscles contribute most substantially towards critical knee joint loads during 
high injury risk tasks such as unanticipated cutting. Furthermore, through “dynamic coupling”
, any muscle in the 
body can potentially induce an acceleration of any segment in the body15. For example, it is possible that certain 
hip muscles can influence knee joint loads during rapid change in direction tasks. Ignoring the role of the hip 
muscles may mean that some valuable information that could be used to guide preventative and rehabilitative 
interventions has been overlooked.
Musculoskeletal modelling enables the cause-effect relationships between muscle forces and joint loads dur-
ing high injury risk tasks to be evaluated16. Subsequently, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role 
of the major lower-limb muscles on key tibiofemoral loading parameters associated with ACL injury during an 
unanticipated sidestep cut. Specifically, we used a computational musculoskeletal modelling approach to predict 
lower-limb muscle contributions to the knee joint anteroposterior shear force as well as the frontal and transverse 
plane moments. Our primary interest was to identify which muscles have the greatest capacity to control/min-
imise the anterior shear force as well as the knee valgus and internal rotation moments, as the function of such 
muscles could then be targeted in ACL prevention programs.
Methods
Participants. 
Eight recreationally active healthy males (age: 27 ± 3.8 years; height: 1.77 ± 0.09 m; mass: 
77.6 ± 12.8 kg) volunteered to participate in this study. All participants had no current or previous musculoskele-
tal injury likely to influence their ability to perform the required tasks. All participants provided written informed 
consent to participate in the study. Ethical approval was granted by the Australian Catholic University Human 
Research Ethics Committee (approval number: 2015-11 H), and the study was carried out in accordance with the 
approved guidelines.
Instrumentation. 
Three-dimensional marker trajectories were collected at 200 Hz using a nine camera 
motion analysis system (VICON, Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom). Ground reaction forces were 
collected via two AMTI OR6-6-2000 ground-embedded force plates (Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., 
Watertown, MA, USA) sampling at 1000 Hz. Surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected at 1000 Hz 
from 10 lower-limb muscles on the dominant leg (defined as the kicking leg; right side for all participants) via two 
wireless EMG systems (Noraxon, Arizona, USA; Myon, Schwarzenberg, Switzerland).
Procedures. 
All participants were barefoot during the completion of all tasks, which allowed exposure of the 
foot for marker placement and kept the foot-ground interaction consistent across all participants. The skin was 
prepared for surface EMG collection by shaving, abrasion and sterilisation. Circular bipolar pre-gelled Ag/AgCl 
electrodes (inter-electrode distance of 2 cm) were then placed on the vastus lateralis and medialis, rectus femoris, 
biceps femoris, medial hamstrings, medial and lateral gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus 
muscles in accordance with Surface Electromyography for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscle (SENIAM) 
guidelines17. EMG-time traces during forceful isometric contractions were visually inspected to verify the correct 
placement of the electrodes and to inspect for cross-talk. Forty-three 14 mm retroreflective markers were affixed 
to various anatomical locations on the torso (sternum, the spinous process of the 7th cervical vertebra, the spinous 
process of a mid-thoracic vertebra, the tip of each acromion), pelvis (anterior and posterior superior iliac spines), 
upper-limbs (medial and lateral elbow and distal radius and ulna) and lower-limbs (medial and lateral femoral 
epicondyles, medial and lateral malleoli, first and fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, calcaneus and three additional 
markers on each shank and thigh) of each participant.
Each participant completed two unanticipated change of direction tasks on their dominant leg. Participants 
were required to perform two single leg hops for a standardised distance of 1.35 m, and then as quickly as possible 
cut to the left (45° sidestep cut) or to the right (45° crossover cut) upon landing from the second hop. We used a 
hopping approach based on prior research18 because it allows speed and foot placement on the force plate to be 
well controlled across participants relative to a running approach. The direction of travel was randomly dictated 
by a set of timing gates that delivered a light signal ~450 ms prior to initial contact on the force plates. Floor 
markings were used to indicate the starting point, the hop landing targets and the required 45° angle from the 
force plates for the cutting direction. A successful trial required that the participant completed the task correctly 
with the entire foot landing within the force plate. This protocol produced approach velocities (2.24 ± 0.15 m/s) 
and cutting angles (41 ± 2°) that were consistent with characteristics reported during ACL injuries19. Note that 
we only analysed sidestep cuts in this investigation, as this task has been most commonly associated with injury 
to the ACL9,10,19,20.
Data processing. 
Marker trajectories were low-pass filtered using a zero-lag, 4th order Butterworth filter 
with a cut-off frequency of 8 Hz. This cut-off frequency was determined via a residual analysis. Ground reaction 
forces were filtered using the same filter and cut-off frequency as the marker data based on published recommen-
dations21. EMG data were corrected for offset, high-pass filtered (20 Hz), full-wave rectified and low-pass filtered 
(6 Hz) using a zero-lag, 4th order Butterworth filter to obtain a linear envelope. EMG data were normalised to the 
peak amplitude obtained in each trial.
Musculoskeletal modelling. 
A 37 degree-of-freedom (DOF) full-body musculoskeletal model, with 80 
musculotendon actuators (lower body) and 17 torque actuators (upper body)22, was used to perform the muscu-
loskeletal simulations in OpenSim16. Each hip was modelled as a 3-DOF ball and socket. Each knee was modelled 
as a 1-DOF hinge, with other rotational (valgus/varus and internal/external rotation) and translational (anter-
oposterior and superior-inferior) movements constrained to change as a function of the knee flexion angle23. A

pin joint was used to represent the ankle (talocrural) joint. The head-trunk segment was modelled as a single 
rigid segment, articulating with the pelvis via a 3-DOF ball and socket joint. Each upper limb was characterised 
by a 3-DOF ball and socket shoulder joint and single-DOF elbow and radioulnar joints. The subtalar, metatarso-
phalangeal, and wrist joints were locked22. The generic model was scaled to each participant’s individual anthro-
pometry as determined during a static trial. An inverse kinematics algorithm was used to calculate joint angles by 
means of a weighted least-squares optimisation that minimised the difference between model and experimental 
marker positions24. Inverse dynamics was used to obtain the joint moments acting about each modelled DOF. 
Muscle forces were obtained via a static optimisation algorithm, which decomposed the joint moments into indi-
vidual muscle forces by minimising the sum of muscle activations squared, taking into account the physiological 
force-length-velocity properties25 of the musculotendinous units. This method of muscle force estimation is com-
putationally efficient and has been used to predict muscle forces in similar high impact movements26–28. Note that 
the maximum isometric force of each actuator was increased 3-fold from the standard model, similar to another 
study that investigated high impact manoeuvres26.
The measured ground reaction forces were decomposed into individual muscular contributions by means of a 
pseudo-inverse-based approach28–30. Each muscle’s contribution to the joint reaction forces and moments about 
the knee were then computed by applying each muscle’s force and contribution to the ground reaction force in 
isolation and resolving the dynamical equations of motion. The knee joint reaction forces and moments represent 
the forces and moments that the knee joint experiences as a consequence of all motions and forces in the model, 
including muscles and other actuators. These parameters differ somewhat from the inverse dynamics based out-
puts used with the static optimisation algorithm to calculate muscle forces.
Outcome variables. 
Outcome variables of interest were each muscle’s contribution to the tibiofemoral 
anteroposterior shear joint reaction force as well as the frontal and transverse plane joint reaction moments, as 
these variables have been shown to be associated with higher ACL loads and/or injury5,6. Since ACL injuries occur 
promptly after initial contact9, we limited our analysis to the weight acceptance phase (period of stance from 
foot-strike to the first trough in the raw vertical ground reaction force) as per previous research31,32. Muscular 
contributions were grouped according to function consistent with a prior approach33, except where these muscles 
had opposing effects on the key tibiofemoral loading parameters. For example, the biceps femoris long head and 
medial hamstrings (i.e. semimembranosus and semitendinosus) have opposing transverse plane actions at the 
knee, hence the biarticular hamstrings were not grouped together (see Supplementary Table S1 for all functional 
groupings). Note that we only report on major muscle groups, and did not report on any muscle that was not 
found to make a meaningful contribution to any of the three key knee reaction forces or moments (see Rajagopal 
et al.22 for all musculotendinous actuators included in the model).
Validation and verification. 
To provide confidence in our simulations, we performed qualitative compar-
isons between the model-based predicted activations and experimental EMG data, accounting for appropriate 
physiological delays (~100ms) as per current recommendations34. We obtained EMG data from experimental 
recordings conducted in the present study and from available data in the literature35,36. Since these comparisons 
were conducted to assess how well the simulation replicated the coordination pattern observed experimentally, 
the normalised EMG data were averaged across participants and then renormalised to the peak amplitude of each 
muscle. The predicted activations were processed using the same normalisation procedure as the EMG data, prior 
to these comparisons. We also compared the time-varying characteristics of our experimental joint angles and 
inverse dynamics based joint moments (Fig. 1) to ensure they were within 2 SD of prior published data34. These 
qualitative comparisons were conducted across the entire stance phase because the weight acceptance phase was 
generally too short to allow any firm conclusions to be made about how well our model-based predicted data 
temporally matched experimental data as well as data obtained from the literature.
We quantitatively verified that our muscle-derived joint moments (computed from the predicted muscle 
forces and their respective moment arms) matched the experimentally measured joint moments (computed via 
inverse dynamics) by calculating the normalised root-mean-square error (nRMSE) and coefficient of determina-
tion (R2). The nRMSE was calculated as:

To verify the suitability of the foot-ground contact model, superposition errors between experimental and 
simulated ground reaction forces were quantitatively evaluated via computation of the nRMSE and R2. These data 
were reported as the median and interquartile range (IQR) due to non-normal distributions.

Additionally, once appropriate physiological delays were taken into account (100 ms corresponds to ~25% of 
stance phase), reasonable agreement was evident between the predicted muscle activations from the model and 
experimentally recorded EMG data obtained from the current study as well as prior literature (Fig. 2).

Anteroposterior shear joint reaction force. 
The net anteroposterior shear force was characterised by 
an anterior shear force of 218 N at initial contact, which gradually declined until switching to a posterior shear 
force at 46% of the weight acceptance phase (Fig. 3A and B). The greatest contributors to the posterior shear 
force were the biarticular hamstrings and soleus. The contribution of each of these muscles increased through-
out weight acceptance, peaking at 173N, 111N, and 77N for the soleus, biceps femoris long head and medial 
hamstrings, respectively. The anterior shear force was primarily produced by the quadriceps and gastrocnemius 
muscle groups. The vasti’s contribution increased throughout weight acceptance, peaking at 225N, whilst contri-
butions from the rectus femoris and lateral gastrocnemius peaked at initial contact at 83N and 38N, respectively. 
The medial gastrocnemius peaked at 84N at 5% of weight acceptance, and remained at around 60N for the major-
ity of the remainder weight acceptance. The non-knee-spanning ankle dorsi-flexors (tibialis anterior, extensor 
digitorum and hallucis longus), adductors and gluteus maximus also contributed 50–60N during mid-weight 
acceptance. The shift to a net posterior shear force at 46% of weight acceptance was mainly explained by a decline 
in the contribution from the gastrocnemius towards anterior shear, and an increase in the contribution from the 
biarticular hamstrings and soleus towards posterior shear.
Frontal plane joint reaction moment (varus/valgus). 
A varus knee joint reaction moment (peak of 
25 Nm) was present for the first 72% of weight acceptance, whereas a valgus knee joint reaction moment (peak 
of 12 Nm) was present for the remaining portion (Fig. 3C and D). Throughout weight acceptance, the gluteal 
muscles had the greatest capacity to oppose the valgus moment. The gluteus medius produced the largest varus 
moment (ranging from 23–32 Nm across weight acceptance). Substantial contributions were also made by the 
piriformis (7–21 Nm) and gluteus maximus (9–19 Nm). The transition to a valgus knee joint reaction moment 
was driven by decreasing contributions from the gluteals, piriformis and adductors towards a varus moment, and 
increasing contributions from the vasti (up to 31 Nm), soleus (up to 10 Nm) and biceps femoris long head (up to 
4 Nm) towards a valgus moment.
Transverse plane joint reaction moment (internal/external rotation). 
An external rotation knee 
joint reaction moment was present throughout the entire weight acceptance period (Fig. 3E and F). The external 
rotation moment was 1–2 Nm for the first quarter of weight acceptance. It progressively increased during the sec-
ond half of weight acceptance, peaking at 25 Nm. The dominant contributors towards this moment were the vasti 
(up to 23 Nm) and soleus (up to 10 Nm) muscles. The gluteus maximus (2–10 Nm) and gluteus medius (4–5 Nm) 
muscles had the greatest potential to oppose this moment (i.e. contribute to an internal rotation knee joint reac-
tion moment) throughout weight acceptance.
Discussion
This study has shown that both knee-spanning and non-knee-spanning muscles contribute to the tibiofemoral 
reaction forces and moments during the weight acceptance phase of a rapid unanticipated sidestep cut. Notably, 
we found the biarticular hamstrings and the soleus muscles to have the greatest potential to oppose the anterior 
shear reaction force, whilst the hip abductors (gluteus medius, gluteus maximus and piriformis) had the greatest 
potential to oppose the knee valgus reaction moment. To the authors’ knowledge, no previous studies have calcu-
lated muscular contributions to knee joint loads during a rapid unanticipated sidestep cut.

The data reported in the present paper are largely consistent with prior literature. Experimental kinematics 
(Fig. 1, top row) and inverse dynamics based joint moments (Fig. 1, bottom row) were within 2 SD of prior 
research investigating similar cutting tasks18,37,38. Additionally, the predicted muscle activations showed rea-
sonable agreement with EMG data for sidestep cutting obtained from the current study and the literature35,36. 
Whilst this consistency provides some evidence that our simulations were physiologically acceptable, the main 
focus of the present study concerned muscular contributions to the tibiofemoral anteroposterior shear reac-
tion force as well as the frontal and transverse plane joint reaction moments. To our knowledge, only one study 
by Sritharan and colleagues33 has reported comparable data. They computed the muscular contributions to the 
‘external’ knee varus moment during gait. Note that Sritharan et al.33 quantified the muscular contributions to 
the inverse dynamics based joint moments, rather than the joint reaction forces/moments as we have reported 
here. Additionally, they did not include all of the muscles we have evaluated in the present study. Finally, they 
investigated walking, which has quite different biomechanical demands to sidestep cutting. Nevertheless, some 
consistent functional roles for key muscles are evident when comparing data from Sritharan et al.33 with equiva-
lent data from the present study. For example, we observed that the gluteal muscle group had the greatest poten-
tial to generate a varus knee joint reaction moment during the weight acceptance phase of sidestep cutting, i.e. 
these muscles opposed the net valgus knee joint reaction moment that occurred during the final 25% of weight 
acceptance (Fig. 3D). Similarly, Sritharan et al.33 found that the gluteus medius and maximus muscles were the 
major contributors to the ‘external’ knee varus moment during the stance phase of walking. They also found that 
the vasti and soleus were dominant contributors towards an ‘external’ knee valgus moment, which is consistent 
with the findings from the current study for cutting (Fig. 3C and D).
Anteroposterior shear joint reaction force. 
The primary role of the ACL is to resist anterior tibial trans-
lation4, and thus tibiofemoral shear has received much attention in the literature5–7. The quadriceps and hamstring

muscle groups are of particular interest in this respect due to their ability to induce anterior and posterior shear 
forces, respectively39. We found that the vasti and biarticular hamstrings were indeed major contributors to ante-
rior and posterior shear forces, respectively. However, our analysis provided insight into the critical role of other 
muscles, particularly the gastrocnemius and soleus, which appeared to have considerable yet opposing roles in 
the development of tibiofemoral shear force (Fig. 3A and B). The opposing roles of the gastrocnemius and soleus 
muscles has been observed in previous research investigating contributions to trunk and leg segmental energy40 
as well as whole body sagittal plane angular momentum during gait41. We have shown that the soleus tends to 
induce posterior shear reaction forces, whilst the gastrocnemius tends to induce anterior shear reaction forces at 
the tibiofemoral joint. Our results therefore suggest that the soleus and gastrocnemius represent ACL agonists 
and antagonists, respectively; an observation that is consistent with prior musculoskeletal modelling27,42 and 
in-vivo studies43. In contrast to these findings, Morgan and colleagues31 reported that the gastrocnemius plays 
a role in unloading the ACL by increasing joint compression and thereby resisting tibial translation44. However, 
this assertion was based on a hypothetical explanation of elevated gastrocnemius forces observed in participants 
with low versus high estimated ACL loading. The role of joint compression is contentious, as animal models have 
shown that whilst joint compression may act to reduce anteroposterior translation, the direct influence on ACL 
loading may still be hazardous45. Nevertheless, we accept that muscular contributions to knee joint compres-
sion could have potential implications for ACL loading, thus we have computed these values for completeness 
and have included the results as supplementary material for the interested reader (see Supplementary Fig. S2). 
In contrast, knee joint anterior shear force has consistently been associated with ACL loading5,7,46–49, thus our 
cause-effect analysis showing that the gastrocnemius group induces anterior shear forces would suggest that the 
role of the gastrocnemius on its own is unlikely to be “protective”
.
Frontal and transverse plane joint reaction moments. 
One of the most noteworthy findings in this 
study is that the gluteal muscle group is capable of generating a varus knee joint reaction moment, thus oppos-
ing (or controlling the magnitude of) the net valgus knee joint reaction moment during the final 25% of weight 
acceptance of sidestep cutting. The gluteus medius provided the greatest contribution to the varus knee joint reac-
tion moment for the entire weight acceptance phase, whilst other muscles (piriformis and gluteus maximus and 
minimus) also made appreciable contributions (Fig. 3D). This result has implications for preventative and reha-
bilitative interventions, as both knee valgus loading50 and lower hip abduction strength51 have been prospectively 
associated with ACL injury. Additionally, knee valgus loading has been observed during ACL injuries9–11, and 
has been directly related to ACL loading5,7,8. The gluteal muscles were also found to be the primary contributors 
to the internal rotation knee joint reaction moment (Fig. 3F), which potentially increases loads on the ACL5,7,12. 
However, the size of this contribution was relatively small (<10 Nm), and the tibiofemoral joint never experi-
enced a net internal rotation reaction moment at any stage during the weight acceptance phase (Fig. 3E and F). 
 
As sidestep cutting is typically associated with valgus loading32, which is thought to be particularly relevant for 
non-contact injury mechanisms9,20, the function of the gluteal muscle group may be an important target for 
prevention programs aiming to reduce ACL injury risk. To our knowledge, no other study has demonstrated the 
importance of the gluteus medius (or the other hip abductor muscles) for opposing the knee valgus moment that 
occurs during sidestep cutting.
Simultaneous multi-direction loading. 
It is thought that loads on the ACL are greatest when the knee 
joint is exposed to an anterior shear force together with a valgus and an internal rotation moment5,7,46. Whilst this 
specific combination of tibiofemoral reaction forces and moments was not observed to occur simultaneously in 
our data (Fig. 3), muscular contributions must still be considered across multiple planes due to their potential to 
cause or oppose relevant joint reaction forces and moments. Whilst a valgus moment that occurs together with an 
internal rotation moment has the potential to increase load on the ACL5,7,8,12, none of the major contributors to 
a valgus knee joint reaction moment were also found to be major contributors to an internal rotation knee joint 
reaction moment (Fig. 3C–F). The relative importance of non-sagittal loads to ACL loading is not universally 
accepted52, whereas anterior and posterior shear force have been consistently shown to load and unload the ACL, 
respectively5–7,46–49. Subsequently, appropriate muscular targets for interventions should be chosen primarily 
based on the magnitude of their contributions to anteroposterior shear force, with contributions to non-sagittal 
plane joint reaction moments perhaps a secondary consideration.
Key clinical implications. 
Based on the findings from this study, we suggest that injury prevention strate-
gies should focus on optimising the function of the hamstring muscle group, as the biceps femoris long head and 
medial hamstrings were shown to be the two primary contributors to posterior shear during weight acceptance 
of sidestep cutting (Fig. 3A). Additionally, these muscles induce opposite loading patterns in the frontal (Fig. 3C) 
and transverse planes (Fig. 3E), thus reducing the likelihood for combined unfavourable loading patterns to be 
generated. The function of the soleus would also seem important, due to this muscle’s contribution to the poste-
rior shear knee joint reaction force (Fig. 3B), whilst also contributing to an external rotation knee joint reaction 
moment (Fig. 3F). However, from a practical standpoint, the function of the soleus may be difficult to isolate from 
the gastrocnemius, a muscle group which we found to contribute to an anterior shear reaction force at the knee. 
Finally, the gluteal group, especially the gluteus medius and the piriformis muscles, were the dominant controllers 
of the valgus knee joint reaction moment (Fig. 3D), and also made no meaningful contribution towards anterior 
shear and their contribution towards an internal rotation knee joint reaction moment was minimal. For these 
reasons, we consider training the function of the gluteus medius and piriformis muscles to be of high priority in 
ACL prevention programs.

Limitations. 
Whilst our study has revealed some novel insights, we acknowledge that there are some limita-
tions to this work. One limitation is that the present study only involved a cohort of eight healthy recreationally 
active males. Further research should consider the influence of different populations such as females, specific ath-
letic subgroups, and pathological populations. Additionally, participants were barefoot during the performance of 
the sidestep cut, which is not representative of many sports that involve footwear. There is the possibility that this 
may have resulted in an imposed foot-strike pattern for some participants, and a natural foot-strike pattern for 
others53. However, we do not believe this influenced the conclusions of the study. The advantage of the barefoot 
condition was that it ensured a consistent foot-ground interaction across participants, and allowed exposure of 
the foot for marker placement.
Another limitation is that we did not compute ACL forces directly. Whilst including knee ligaments into the 
musculoskeletal model would have allowed us to predict ligament (or ACL) forces directly, this complexity would 
come at the cost of introducing additional uncertainties related to in-vivo ligament properties54. Due to the sen-
sitivity of estimated ACL forces to these ligament properties (e.g. reference strains and ligament stiffness)54, we 
opted to exclude ligaments from the model.
The decision to exclude ligaments from the model meant that translations and non-sagittal rotations at the 
knee needed to be constrained as a function of the knee flexion angle23, similar to prior studies27, in order to 
ensure our predicted muscle forces were as accurate as possible. Another advantage of adopting such constraints 
is minimising the impact of soft tissue artefact. Prior research has shown that non-sagittal plane knee rotations 
are particularly sensitive to soft tissue artefact when using skin-mounted marker systems18. Whilst soft tissue arte-
fact can influence all joint angles, we used a global optimisation inverse kinematics algorithm to obtain our joint 
angle data, which has previously been shown to be capable of minimising the influence of soft tissue artefact24. 
We note that our kinematic data are consistent with prior literature investigating similar change of direction tasks 
using both skin-mounted37,38 and bone-pin marker systems18.
Muscle forces in the present study were estimated using a static optimisation algorithm, which does have some 
limitations. Unfortunately, muscle forces cannot be directly validated, as in-vivo muscle forces are not practically 
feasible to measure55, thus we have no way of directly validating our model predictions. Static optimisation has 
been shown to provide accurate predictions of in-vivo joint contact forces56,57, which serves as an indirect vali-
dation of muscle forces due to the high dependency of joint contact forces on muscle forces55. Furthermore, our 
predicted muscle activations showed reasonable agreement with experimentally recorded EMG data across the 
stance phase (Fig. 2). It has been suggested that static optimisation may not adequately predict co-contraction 
of muscles. However, our predicted muscle activations (Fig. 2) as well as recently published data26 do display 
evidence of co-contraction. Nevertheless, we recognise that these co-contraction patterns were not necessar-
ily subject-specific but we do not believe this limitation influenced our conclusions. Further research utilising 
more subject-specific approaches, such as EMG-driven and EMG-hybrid modelling58,59, may yield further clinical 
insight.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that knee-spanning as well as non-knee-spanning muscles contribute 
substantially to anteroposterior shear forces as well as frontal and transverse plane joint reaction moments at the 
tibiofemoral joint. Specifically, the vasti and gastrocnemius muscles were found to be the major contributors to 
the anterior shear reaction force, whilst the biarticular hamstrings and the soleus were the major contributors 
to the posterior shear reaction force. The valgus knee joint reaction moment was primarily produced by both 
knee-spanning (vasti and biceps femoris long head) and non-knee-spanning (soleus) muscles. This moment was 
opposed by the non-knee-spanning gluteal muscles, particularly the gluteus medius, gluteus maximus and piri-
formis. The external rotation knee joint reaction moment throughout the weight acceptance phase of sidestep 
cutting was primarily generated by the vasti and soleus muscles. Based on our consideration of multiple loading 
states, we conclude that the hamstrings (biceps femoris long head and medial hamstrings), soleus, and the gluteals 
(especially gluteus medius) have the greatest potential to offset ACL loading during an unanticipated sidestep 
cutting task. Optimising the function of these muscles should therefore be of high priority in rehabilitative and 
preventative programs.
