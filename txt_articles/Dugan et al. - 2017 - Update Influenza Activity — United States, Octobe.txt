Influenza activity in the United States was low during 
October 2017, but has been increasing since the beginning 
of November. Influenza A viruses have been most commonly 
identified, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. 
Several influenza activity indicators were higher than is typically 
seen for this time of year. The majority of influenza viruses 
characterized during this period were genetically or antigeni-
cally similar to the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere cell-grown 
vaccine reference viruses. These data indicate that currently 
circulating viruses have not undergone significant antigenic 
drift; however, circulating A(H3N2) viruses are antigenically 
less similar to egg-grown A(H3N2) viruses used for producing 
the majority of influenza vaccines in the United States. It is 
difficult to predict which influenza viruses will predominate in 
the 2017–18 influenza season; however, in recent past seasons 
in which A(H3N2) viruses predominated, hospitalizations and 
deaths were more common, and the effectiveness of the vaccine 
was lower. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for 
all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. 
Multiple influenza vaccines are approved and recommended 
for use during the 2017–18 season, and vaccination should 
continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulat-
ing and unexpired vaccine is available. This report summarizes 
U.S. influenza activity* during October 1–November 25, 2017 
(surveillance weeks 40–47).†
Viral Surveillance
U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) and National 
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System labora-
tories, which include both public health and clinical labora-
tories throughout the United States, contribute to virologic 
* The CDC influenza surveillance system collects five categories of information 
from eight data sources: 1) viral surveillance (U.S. World Health Organization 
collaborating laboratories, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus 
Surveillance System, and novel influenza A virus case reporting); 2) outpatient 
illness surveillance (U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance 
Network); 3) mortality (National Center for Health Statistics Mortality 
Surveillance System and influenza-associated pediatric mortality reports); 
4) hospitalizations (FluSurv-NET, which includes the Emerging Infections 
Program and surveillance in three additional states); and 5) summary of the 
geographic spread of influenza (state and territorial epidemiologist reports).

surveillance for influenza. During October 1–November 25, 
2017, clinical laboratories tested 135,202 specimens for influ-
enza virus; 5,070 (3.7%) specimens tested positive for influenza 
virus (Figure 1), including 3,723 (73.4%) that tested positive 
for influenza A viruses and 1,347 (26.6%) that tested positive 
for influenza B viruses.
Public health laboratories tested 8,777 specimens during 
October 1–November 25, 2017, and 1,969 (22.4%) were posi-
tive for influenza, including 1,714 (87%) influenza A and 255 
(13%) influenza B viruses (Figure 2). Among the 1,696 influ-
enza A viruses subtyped, 1,527 (90%) were influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses, and 169 (10%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
viruses. Influenza B virus lineage information was available 
for 170 (66.1%) tested influenza B viruses; 159 (93.5%) 
belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 11 (6.5%) to the 
B/Victoria lineage.
Data on age were available for 1,737 influenza-positive 
patients tested by public health laboratories. Overall, 163 
(9.4%) persons were aged 0–4 years, 475 (27.3%) were aged 
5–24 years, 576 (33.2%) were aged 25–64 years, and 523 
(30.1%) were aged ≥65 years. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were 
predominant among all age groups, accounting for 69.9% of 
viruses identified among persons aged 0–4 years and 87.8% 
of viruses reported among persons aged ≥65 years. The largest 
proportion of reported influenza B viruses occurred in persons 
aged 5–24 years; influenza B viruses accounted for 16.6% of 
the viruses reported for that age group.
Novel Influenza A Viruses
Five human infections with novel influenza A viruses 
were reported to CDC by five states (one each in 
Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, and Ohio) during 
October 1–November 25, 2017. All of these were variant§ 
virus infections (human infections with influenza viruses that 
normally circulate in swine). Two infections were caused by 
influenza A(H3N2)v viruses, two by influenza A(H1N2)v 
§ Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when 
isolated from swine but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from 
humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human 
population have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza 
viruses circulating in swine.

viruses, and one by an influenza A(H1N1)v virus. The patient 
from Colorado reported exposure to swine at an agricultural 
event during the week preceding illness onset. The patient from 
Iowa had direct contact with swine during the week preceding 
illness onset. The patient from Michigan was a close contact of 
a person with laboratory-confirmed A(H3N2)v virus infection 
that had been reported earlier this year. Although that patient 
also reported exposure to swine, it occurred more than a week 
before illness onset, which is outside the typical incubation 
period. It is possible that this infection resulted from limited 
human-to-human transmission. The patient from Nebraska 
reported no contact with swine during the week preceding ill-
ness onset; however, a household member did report exposure 
to swine. The patient from Ohio reported exposure to swine 
at an agricultural fair during the week preceding illness onset. 
Two of the five patients were children aged <18 years, one 
patient was an adult aged 18–44 years, and two patients were 
adults aged ≥45 years. Two of the patients were hospitalized, 
and all have fully recovered from their illness. No ongoing 
human-to-human transmission was identified.
The A(H3N2)v viruses detected in Michigan and Nebraska 
had a hemagglutinin (HA) gene segment derived from a 
seasonal human H3N2 virus that was likely introduced into 
swine by reverse zoonosis (i.e., humans infecting swine) in 
2010. These viruses were closely related to H3N2 viruses 
known to circulate in the U.S. swine population (1), as well 
as to variant virus infections detected in Delaware, Maryland, 
Michigan, North Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania during 
May–September 2017 (2). The A(H1N2)v viruses detected in 
Colorado and Ohio had HA gene segments from the delta sub-
lineage of the classical swine H1 HA lineage (3). The HA and 
neuraminidase (NA) gene segments of this virus were closely 
related to 2016/2017 H1N2 influenza viruses known to circu-
late in the U.S. swine population and have been sporadically 
detected in other A(H1N2)v virus infections. The A(H1N1)v 
virus detected in Iowa had HA and NA gene segments derived

introduced into swine by a recent reverse zoonosis. This virus 
was closely related to H1N1 influenza viruses currently circu-
lating in the U.S. swine population.
Antigenic and Genetic Characterization of 
Influenza Viruses
In the United States, public health laboratories participating 
in influenza surveillance as WHO collaborating laboratories 
are asked to submit a subset of influenza-positive respiratory 
specimens to CDC for virus characterization according to 
specific guidelines (4). CDC characterizes influenza viruses 
through one or more laboratory tests, including genomic 
sequencing, antigenic characterization by hemagglutination 
inhibition (HI), or neutralization assays. Circulating viruses 
that have been isolated and propagated in mammalian cell 
culture are evaluated for antigenic similarity with cell culture–
propagated reference viruses representing the recommended 
vaccine components of the Northern Hemisphere 2017–18 
vaccine (5). This process establishes whether antigenic drift 
from the vaccine reference viruses has occurred.
All influenza-positive surveillance specimens submitted for 
surveillance and received by CDC are sequenced by next gen-
eration sequencing (NGS), using previously described genomic 
enrichment practices (6–8) adapted by CDC. The genomic 
data from the NGS pipeline are analyzed to determine the 
genetic identity of circulating viruses and submitted to public 
databases (GenBank or GISAID EpiFlu). Data obtained from 
antigenic characterization are important in the assessment of 
the similarity between reference vaccine viruses and circulat-
ing viruses. In vitro antigenic characterization data generated 
through HI assays or virus neutralization assays are used to 
assess whether genetic changes in circulating viruses affect anti-
genicity, which subsequently might affect vaccine effectiveness.
Since the 2014–15 season, many influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses lack sufficient hemagglutination titers for antigenic 
characterization using HI assays. Therefore, a subset of 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses are selected for antigenic charac-
terization using the virus neutralization focus reduction assay 
to assess the ability of various antisera to neutralize infectiv-
ity of the test viruses. CDC has antigenically or genetically 
characterized 277 influenza viruses collected and submitted 
by U.S. laboratories since October 1, 2017, including 38 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 187 influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses, and 52 influenza B viruses.
Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene segments from 38 
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected since October 1, 2017, 
showed that all belonged to subclade 6B.1 (Figure 3). Thirteen 
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were analyzed using HI assays with 
ferret antisera, and all of these viruses were antigenically similar 
to the cell culture–propagated 6B.1 virus A/Michigan/45/2015, 
the reference virus representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine 
virus for the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza season.
One hundred and eighty-seven influenza A(H3N2) viruses 
collected since October 1, 2017, were sequenced, and phy-
logenetic analysis of the HA gene segments illustrated that 
multiple clades/subclades were cocirculating (Figure 3). The 
HA gene segments belonged to clade 3C.2a or subclade 
3C.2a1, with 3C.2a predominating (Figure 3). Sixty-four 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized, 
and 63 (98.4%) were well-inhibited (reacting at titers that were 
within fourfold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera 
raised against A/Michigan/15/2014 (3C.2a), a cell-propagated 
A/Hong Kong/4801/2014–like reference virus representing the 
A(H3N2) component of the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere 
influenza vaccines. Although considerable genetic diversity 
has been observed among H3N2 viruses, there has been no 
evidence of significant antigenic drift in the limited number 
of H3N2 viruses tested from this season. A smaller number, 
45 (70.3%) of viruses tested, were well-inhibited by antiserum 
raised against egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 ref-
erence virus representing the A(H3N2) vaccine component. 
This is likely because of egg-adaptive amino acid changes in 
the HA of the egg-propagated virus.
Two influenza B/Victoria-lineage viruses were sequenced and 
phylogenetically analyzed, and the HA gene segment of both 
viruses belonged to genetic clade V1A, the same genetic clade 
as the vaccine reference virus, B/Brisbane/60/2008. However, 
the HA gene segment of one virus has a 6-nucleotide deletion 
(encoding amino acids 162 and 163) and viruses like this, 
abbreviated as V1A-2Del, were previously reported (2). This 
V1A-2Del virus was poorly inhibited (reacting at titers that 
were eightfold or more reduced compared with the homolo-
gous virus titer) with antisera raised to cell culture–propa-
gated B/Brisbane/60/2008, the reference virus representing 
the B/Victoria lineage component of 2017–18 Northern 
Hemisphere vaccines.
Phylogenetic analysis of 50 influenza B/Yamagata-lineage 
viruses show that the HA gene segments belonged to clade Y3 
(Figure 3). Fourteen B/Yamagata lineage viruses were antigeni-
cally characterized, and all were antigenically similar to the 
cell culture–propagated B/Phuket/3073/2013, the reference 
virus representing the B/Yamagata-lineage component of 
quadrivalent vaccines for the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere 
influenza season.

Antiviral Resistance of Influenza Viruses
The WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza at CDC tested 291 
influenza virus specimens (41 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 200 
influenza A(H3N2), and 50 influenza B viruses) collected in 
the United States since October 1, 2017, for resistance to the 
influenza NA inhibitor antiviral medications oseltamivir, zana-
mivir, and peramivir, drugs currently approved for use against 
seasonal influenza. All 291 influenza viruses tested were sensi-
tive to all three antiviral medications. High levels of resistance 
to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist 
among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses. Adamantane drugs are not recommended for use 
against influenza at this time.
Outpatient Illness Surveillance
During October 1–November 25, 2017, the weekly percent-
age of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness¶ (ILI) to heath 
care providers participating in the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-
like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) ranged from 1.3% to 
2.3%. During the week ending November 25, 2.3% of patient 
visits reported through ILINet were for ILI, which is above the 
national baseline** level of 2.2% (Figure 4). The increase in 
the percentage of patient visits for ILI during the week end-
ing November 25 (surveillance week 47) might be influenced 
in part by a reduction in routine health care visits during the 
holidays, as has occurred in previous seasons. During the 
week ending November 25, four of 10 U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services regions†† (Regions 1, 4, 6, and 
7) reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI at or above 
their region-specific baseline levels.
 ¶ Defined as a fever (temperature ≥100°F [≥37.8°C], oral or equivalent) and 
cough or sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza.
 
** The national and regional baselines are the mean percentage of visits for ILI 
during noninfluenza weeks for the previous three seasons plus two standard 
deviations. Noninfluenza weeks are defined as periods of ≥2 consecutive weeks 
in which each week accounted for <2% of the season’s total number of specimens 
that tested positive for influenza in public health laboratories. National and 
regional percentages of patient visits for ILI are weighted based on state 
population. Use of the national baseline for regional data is not appropriate.
 
†† The 10 regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, 
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont; 
Region 2: New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands; 
Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, 
and West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, 
New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and 
Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, 
and Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, American 
Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States 
of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau; 
Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.
ILINet data are used to produce a weekly jurisdiction-level 
measure of ILI activity,§§ ranging from minimal to high. 
For the week ending November 25, three states (Louisiana, 
Mississippi, and South Carolina) experienced high ILI activity; 
one state (Georgia) experienced moderate ILI activity; 10 states 
(Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Nebraska, 
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Virginia) experienced 
low ILI activity; the District of Columbia, New York City, 
and 36 states (Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, 
New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, 
Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) expe-
rienced minimal ILI activity; and Puerto Rico had insufficient 
data to calculate an ILI activity level.
Geographic Spread of Influenza Activity
Influenza activity levels reported by state and territorial 
epidemiologists indicate the geographic spread of influenza 
viruses. For the week ending November 25 (surveillance 
week 47), four states (Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and 
Oklahoma) reported widespread activity.¶¶ Guam and 10 states 
(Arkansas, Connecticut, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, New 
Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, and 
Washington) reported regional activity. Puerto Rico and 
24 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, 
Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, 
Wisconsin, and Wyoming) reported local activity. The District 
of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 12 states (Delaware, 
 
§§ Activity levels are based on the percentage of outpatient visits in a jurisdiction 
attributed to ILI and are compared with the average percentage of ILI visits 
that occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation. Activity 
levels range from minimal, corresponding to ILI activity from outpatient 
clinics at or below the average, to high, corresponding to ILI activity from 
outpatient clinics much higher than the average. Because the clinical definition 
of ILI is nonspecific, not all ILI is caused by influenza; however, when 
combined with laboratory data, the information on ILI activity provides a 
clearer picture of influenza activity in the United States.
 
¶¶ Levels of activity are 1) no activity; 2) sporadic: isolated laboratory-confirmed 
influenza cases or a laboratory-confirmed outbreak in one institution, with no 
increase in activity; 3) local: increased ILI, or two or more institutional outbreaks 
(ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in one region of the state, with recent 
laboratory evidence of influenza in that region; virus activity no greater than 
sporadic in other regions; 4) regional: increased ILI activity or institutional 
outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in two or more outbreaks, but 
less than half of the regions in the state with recent laboratory evidence of influenza 
in those regions; and 5) widespread: increased ILI activity or institutional outbreaks 
(ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in at least half the regions in the state, 
with recent laboratory evidence of influenza in the state.

Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations
CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with labora-
tory-confirmed influenza infections in adults and children 
through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network 
(FluSurv-NET),*** which covers approximately 27 million 
persons (9% of the U.S. population). During October 1, 2017–
November 25, 2017, a total of 566 laboratory-confirmed 
influenza-related hospitalizations were reported, with a cumu-
lative incidence for all age groups of 2.0 per 100,000 popula-
tion. The hospitalization rate was highest among persons aged 
≥65 years, who accounted for approximately 50% of reported 
influenza-associated hospitalizations.
The cumulative influenza hospitalization rates per 100,000 
population during October 1, 2017–November 25, 2017, for 
persons aged 0–4 years, 5–17 years, 18–49 years, 50–64 years, 
and ≥65 years were 1.6, 0.6, 0.8, 2.4, and 7.3, respectively. 
Among all hospitalizations, 484 (85.5%) were associated with 
influenza A virus infections, 80 (14.1%) with influenza B 
virus infections, and two (0.4%) with influenza A virus and 
influenza B virus coinfections. Among the 146 patients for 
whom influenza A subtype information was available, 127 
(87.0%) were infected with influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 19 
(13.0%) were infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.
Pneumonia and Influenza-Associated Mortality
CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza (P&I)–attributed 
deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS) Mortality Reporting System. The percentages of 
 *** FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed, 
influenza-associated hospitalizations in children and adolescents aged <18 years 
(since the 2003–04 influenza season) and adults aged ≥18 years (since the 
2005–06 influenza season). The FluSurv-NET covers approximately 70 counties 
in the 10 Emerging Infections Program states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, 
Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee) 
and additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. 
IHSP began during the 2009–10 season to enhance surveillance during the 2009 
H1N1 pandemic. IHSP sites included Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Oklahoma, and 
South Dakota during the 2009–10 season; Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, 
Rhode Island, and Utah during the 2010–11 season; Michigan, Ohio, Rhode 
Island, and Utah during the 2011–12 season; Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode 
Island, and Utah during the 2012–13 season; and Michigan, Ohio, and Utah 
during the 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, and 2017–18 seasons. 
Cumulative unadjusted incidence rates are calculated using CDC’s National 
Center for Health Statistics population estimates for the counties included in 
the surveillance catchment area. Laboratory confirmation is dependent on 
clinician-ordered influenza testing, and testing for influenza often is underutilized 
because of the poor reliability of rapid test results and greater reliance on clinical 
diagnosis for influenza. Therefore, cases identified as part of influenza 
hospitalization surveillance likely are an underestimation of the actual number 
of persons hospitalized with influenza.
deaths attributed to P&I are released 2 weeks after the week 
of death to allow for collection of sufficient data to produce a 
stable P&I mortality percentage. Based on data from NCHS 
available on November 30, 2017, 5.7% of all U.S. deaths 
occurring during the week ending November 11, 2017, 
(surveillance week 45) were attributed to P&I. This percent-
age is below the epidemic threshold††† of 6.5% for week 45. 
Since October 1, the weekly percentage of deaths attributed 
to P&I has ranged from 5.7% to 6.2% and has not exceeded 
the epidemic threshold for this season. P&I percentages for 
recent weeks might be artificially low because of a backlog of 
records requiring manual processing, and the percentage of 
deaths caused by P&I is higher among manually coded death 
certificates than among machine-coded death certificates. The 
percentage of deaths caused by P&I will likely increase as more 
data become available.
Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality
As of November 25, 2017 (surveillance week 47), five 
laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths 
occurring during the 2017–18 season were reported to CDC. 
Two deaths were associated with an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
virus infection, two were associated with an influenza A(H3) 
virus infection, and one was associated with an influenza A 
virus for which no subtyping was performed. Since influenza-
associated pediatric mortality became a nationally notifiable 
condition in 2004, the number of influenza-associated pedi-
atric deaths per season has ranged from 37 to 171, excluding 
the 2009 pandemic, when 358 pediatric deaths were reported 
to CDC during April 15, 2009–October 2, 2010.
Discussion
Influenza activity in the United States for the 2017–18 
season was low during October but has been increasing since 
early November. The timing of influenza activity often varies; 
however, peak influenza activity in the United States most 
commonly occurs during December–February, and substantial 
influenza activity can be observed through May. It is difficult 
to predict when influenza activity will peak for the current 
season; however, influenza activity will increase in the coming 
weeks. During October 1–November 25, 2017, A(H3N2) 
viruses were most commonly reported, but A(H1N1)pdm09 
and influenza B viruses also were reported. The majority of 
influenza viruses collected in the United States since October 
1, 2017, were characterized antigenically or genetically as 
 ††† The seasonal baseline proportion of P&I deaths is projected using a robust 
regression procedure, in which a periodic regression model is applied to the 
observed percentage of deaths from P&I that were reported by the National 
Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System during the 
preceding 5 years. The epidemic threshold is set at 1.645 standard deviations 
above the seasonal baseline.

being similar to the cell-grown reference viruses representing 
the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine viruses, 
indicating that significant antigenic drift has not occurred 
at this time. However, some currently circulating A(H3N2) 
viruses are less similar to egg-adapted viruses used for produc-
tion of the majority of U.S. influenza vaccines.
Although influenza vaccine effectiveness can range widely 
from season to season, influenza vaccination is the most effective 
currently available method to prevent influenza and its compli-
cations. However, less than half of the U.S. population has been 
vaccinated in recent influenza seasons. Even with influenza 
vaccine effectiveness in the range of 30% to 60%, influenza 
vaccination prevents millions of infections and medical visits 
and tens of thousands of influenza-associated hospitalizations 
each year in the United States.§§§ Health care 
providers should recommend influenza vaccine 
now and throughout the influenza season to 
all unvaccinated persons aged ≥6 months who 
do not have contraindications. Children aged 
6 months–8 years who had not previously 
received a total of ≥2 doses of any trivalent 
or quadrivalent influenza vaccine (doses do 
not have to be received in the same influenza 
season) before July 1, 2017, require 2 doses for 
the 2017–18 season. The interval between the 
2 doses should be at least 4 weeks (5).
For the 2017–18 season, manufacturers 
projected they would supply the United States 
with 151 million–166 million doses of inject-
able influenza vaccine. As of November 24, 
2017, approximately 148.2 million doses of 
vaccine had already been distributed. Influenza 
vaccination coverage estimates for this season 
show coverage similar to the same time last sea-
son among the general population. Survey data 
collected through early November 2017 indi-
cate that 38.6% of all persons aged ≥6 months 
reported receiving flu vaccination (compared 
with 39.8% at this time last season). This leaves 
approximately 3 out of 5 persons in the United 
States unprotected against influenza. These 
estimates are reported on the CDC website 
(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/). 
The majority of influenza viruses collected 
this season, although small in number, have 
been antigenically and genetically characterized 
as being similar to the cell-grown reference 
viruses representing the 2017–18 Northern 
Hemisphere influenza vaccine viruses. The 
lack of significant antigenic drift observed for 
recently circulating influenza viruses further 
suggests that vaccination with the Northern Hemisphere 
influenza vaccine should offer similar protection as past seasons 
when cell-grown reference vaccine viruses were most similar 
to circulating viruses. Vaccine effectiveness can vary between 
influenza seasons and by virus type or subtype. Studies have 
shown reduced vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2) viruses 
(30–40%), in the absence of significant antigenic drift, when 
compared with A(H1N1) and influenza B viruses (9). This 
reduction in effectiveness might result, in part, from the egg 
propagation of influenza A(H3N2) vaccine virus components

required for most influenza vaccine products licensed in 
the United States. For example, egg adaptation of current 
A(H3N2) viruses typically results in a loss of N-linked glyco-
sylation motif at residues 158-160 of the HA protein, which 
is within an important antibody epitope (site B). Other factors 
that might also contribute to the reduced effectiveness against 
A(H3N2) viruses include the naturally occurring, high level of 
genetic diversity and rapid evolutionary rate of this particular 
subtype and modification of the immune response to vaccine 
because of prior infection or vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness 
studies are needed to ascertain the level of protection that 
influenza vaccination provides to the population, but these 
data will not be available until later in the season.
Influenza antiviral medications are an important adjunct 
to vaccination in the treatment and prevention of influenza. 
Treatment with influenza antiviral medications as close to the 
onset of illness as possible is recommended for patients with 
confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, compli-
cated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or 
who are at high risk for influenza complications. Antiviral treat-
ment should be initiated as soon as possible for patients who 
are at high risk for complications or who are severely ill with 
suspected influenza infection, even if rapid antigen-detection 
influenza diagnostic test results are negative (10).
Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted 
online weekly (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly). Additional 
information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, 
influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel 
influenza A infections in humans is available online (https://

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity 
year-round in the United States. Timing of influenza activity and 
predominant circulating influenza viruses varies by season.
What is added by this report?
Influenza activity remained low in the United States during 
October 2017, but has been increasing since November. As of 
November 25, influenza A(H3N2) viruses were the most 
commonly identified viruses. The majority of influenza viruses 
collected in the United States since October 1, 2017, were 
characterized antigenically or genetically as being similar to the 
cell-grown reference viruses representing the 2017–18 Northern 
Hemisphere influenza vaccine viruses. All influenza viruses 
tested to date have been sensitive to the antiviral drugs 
oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.
What are the implications for public health practice?
In the United States, annual influenza vaccination can reduce 
the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza and transmitting 
the virus to others and is recommended for all persons aged 
≥6 months. Annual influenza vaccination offers optimal 
protection regardless of whether the vaccine composition has 
changed since the previous season. Although vaccination is 
the best method for preventing and reducing the impact of 
influenza, antiviral medications are an important adjunct. Early 
treatment with influenza antiviral medications is recom-
mended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza 
(either seasonal influenza or novel influenza virus infection) 
who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who 
require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza-
related complications.
