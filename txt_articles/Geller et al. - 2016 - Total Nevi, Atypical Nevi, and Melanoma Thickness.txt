IMPORTANCE Nevi are among the strongest risk factors for melanoma. However, little is
known about the association of many total nevi (TN) or atypical nevi (AN) with tumor
thickness.
OBJECTIVES To examine the association between age and the number of TN and AN and to
explore whether there was a relationship between TN or AN and tumor thickness, controlling
for multiple variables.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Survey of patients with melanoma at 2 academic sites
and an affiliated Veteran Affairs medical center. Participants included 566 patients surveyed
within 3 months of diagnosis. Patients were surveyed in the melanoma clinics from May 17,
2006, through March 31, 2009, within 3 months of diagnostic biopsy. The dates of the
analysis were April 1, 2015, to August 1, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Counts of TN and AN were performed at the first visit after
diagnosis and were categorized as 0 to 20, 20 to 50, or more than 50 for TN and as 0, 1 to 5,
or more than 5 for AN. Tumor thickness was categorized as 2.00 mm or less or as 2.01 mm or
greater. All analyses were stratified by patient age (<60 or �60 years). Logistic regression
was used to test associations, controlling for age, sex, anatomic location of melanoma,
institution, histologic subtype, marital status, performance of skin self-examination, number
of health care visits in the past year, mode of melanoma discovery, and receipt of skin
examination by a physician.
RESULTS The study population included 566 patients. Their mean (SD) age was 56.7 (15.9)
years, and 39.0% (n = 221) were female. Of 566 patients, the number of TN was classified as
0 to 20 (66.4% [n = 376]), 20 to 50 (20.5% [n = 116]), or more than 50 (13.1% [n = 74]).
Atypical nevus counts were 0 (73.3% [n = 415]), 1 to 5 (14.5% [n = 82]), or more than 5 (12.2%
[n = 69]). For those younger than 60 years, the presence of more than 50 TN was associated
with a sharply reduced risk of thick melanoma (odds ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12-0.81), and the
presence of more than 5 AN compared with no AN was associated with thicker melanoma
(odds ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.02-5.75).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most patients with melanoma had few nevi and no AN. In
younger patients (<60 years), thick melanomas were commonly found in those with fewer
TN but more AN, suggesting that physicians and patients should not rely on the total nevus
count as a sole reason to perform skin examinations or to determine a patient’
s at-risk status.
Younger patients should be educated on the increased risk of thicker melanomas that is
associated with having more AN.

S
tudies1,2haveprovidedevidencethatthenumberoftotal
nevi (TN) and atypical nevi (AN) is strongly associated
with risk of melanoma. Yet, the relationship of these dis-
tinctive mole patterns with tumor thickness and cancer prog-
nosis is unclear and appears to be complex. The presence and
number of TN and AN are known to vary by age and sex, but it
is unknown how this finding relates to the severity and out-
comesofmelanoma.Furthermore,individualswiththesemole
patterns may be more likely to practice skin self-examination
(SSE)andreceivephysicianskinexamination(PSE)forskincan-
cer, which may lead to earlier detection of melanoma and thin-
ner tumors at diagnosis. These questions have received little
attention in prior studies.
Our group conducted a survey of 566 patients with mela-
noma at 2 academic centers in California and Michigan within
3 months of diagnosis.3 Patients were asked at that time to re-
call events in the year before diagnosis. Our primary objec-
tives were to examine the association between age and the
number of TN and AN and to explore whether there was a re-
lationship between TN or AN and tumor thickness at diagno-
sis, controlling for multiple variables.
Methods
Study Participants
Approval for the study was obtained from the institutional re-
view boards of Stanford University Medical Center (SUMC), the
affiliated Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System
(VAPAHCS), and the University of Michigan (UM). Written
informed consent was obtained for all study participants. Eli-
gible, consecutive patients 18 years or older with a recent di-
agnosis of invasive cutaneous melanoma were surveyed at
SUMC/VAPAHCS, as previously described.3 Because of the
high proportion of thin melanoma at UM, a random sample of
33% of individuals with melanoma thickness of 2.00 mm or
less and all eligible patients with melanoma thickness of
2.01 mm or greater were surveyed.3 Patients were surveyed in
the melanoma clinics from May 17, 2006, through March 31,
2009, within 3 months of diagnostic biopsy. The dates of the
analysiswereApril1,2015,toAugust1,2015.Respondentswere
instructed in person to answer all questions for the 12 months
before diagnosis, and there were reminders in multiple loca-
tions on the survey to reinforce this point. All surveys were
reviewed to ensure that all questions were completed.
Measures
Measures included age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital or co-
habitation status (married, widowed, single or never mar-
ried, and divorced or separated). Age was first categorized by
quartiles(≤45,46-57,58-68,or≥69years).Subsequently,itwas
dichotomized as younger than 60 years vs 60 years or older
given increasing rates of thicker tumors and increased mor-
tality among older individuals.3 Performance of SSE was de-
fined as carefully examining all of one’
s moles, including those
on the back, at least once per year. Receipt of a PSE was de-
fined as a health care professional examining a patient’
s skin,
including the back and chest, for cancer in the year before
diagnosis. The number of health care visits in the year before
diagnosis was categorized as never, once, 2 to 3 times, or more
than 3 times. Mode of discovery of melanoma was defined as
self, other (family, friend, or partner), or health care profes-
sional (including physician or nurse). Anatomic location of the
primary tumor was recorded on the pathology report accord-
ing to the number of possible body sites and then classified as
either anterior or posterior. Pathology reports included mela-
noma thickness, ulceration, and histologic subtype (superfi-
cial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna melanoma, acral
lentiginous, desmoplastic, or other).
At the first visit after diagnosis, 2 experienced pigmented
lesion specialists (T.M.J. and S.M.S.) counted the number of
TN and AN using established guidelines, based on size (gen-
erally >6 mm), color (variegation), topographical asymmetry,
dermoscopic features, and overall nevus morphologic struc-
ture. All nevi were counted in the total nevus count, regard-
less of the size, and dermoscopic examination of AN was
standard in these pigmented lesion practices to avoid misclas-
sification of early or evolving melanoma in situ as AN. Subse-
quent analyses controlled for institution.
Outcome Measures
The primary study outcomes were the TN count and the pres-
ence of AN, which were assessed by the physician at the initial
melanoma visit, with classification of TN as 0 to 20, 20 to 50,
ormorethan50andANas0,1to5,ormorethan5.Tumorthick-
nesswascategorizedas2.00mmorlessoras2.01mmorgreater.
Statistical Analysis
Amongallcaserespondentswithtumorthicknessasanoutcome,
we used a multivariable logistic regression model that first ad-
justed for age alone and then in the second analysis included
terms for age, sex, anatomic location of melanoma (anterior vs
posterior),institution(UMvsSUMC/VAPAHCS),histologicsub-
type(superficialspreadingmelanomavsnon–superficialspread-
ing melanoma), marital status (married vs unmarried), perfor-
manceofSSE,numberofhealthcarevisitsinthepastyear,mode

Thisstudyincluded566patientswithmelanoma(Table1).Most
(66.4% [n = 376]) had 0 to 20 TN, with 20.5% (n = 116) having
20to50,and13.1%(n = 74)havingmorethan50.Notably,43.7%
(n = 62) of the youngest patients (≤45 years) had few TN (0-
20),andthisratealmostdoubledfortheoldestpatients.Twenty-
eight percent (n = 40) of the youngest patients had more than
50 TN. This rate dropped to 14.1% (n = 19) for patients 46 to 57
years, 7.5% (n = 11) for patients 58 to 68 years, and 2.8% (n = 4)

for the oldest patients. There were no significant differences in
TN by sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, institution, or ana-
tomic location of melanoma. Patients with lentigo maligna
melanoma were also more likely to have fewer TN.
Atypical Nevi
Atypical nevus counts were 0 (73.3% [n = 415]), 1 to 5 (14.5%
[n = 82]), or more than 5 (12.2% [n = 69]) (Table 1). A total of
51.4% (n = 73) of patients 45 years or younger had no AN, and
this proportion rose considerably by age up to 93.0% (n = 133)
for the oldest patients. A total of 26.8% (n = 38) of patients 45
years or younger had more than 5 AN as opposed to 14.1%
(n = 19) in those 46 to 57 years old and 6.8% (n = 10) in those
58to68yearsold.Only1.4%(n = 2)ofpatients69yearsorolder
had more than 5 AN. No significant differences were found in
AN by sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, or anatomic loca-
tion of melanoma. Patients with lentigo maligna melanoma
were also more likely to have no AN, and AN were more
common in patients from UM.
TN by AN
The number of AN rose as the number of TN increased, and
AN were uncommon among those with few TN. For example,
90.7%(341of376)with0to20TNhadnoAN.Conversely,13.1%
(74 of 566) of patients had more than 50 TN, and, of these,
58.1% (43 of 74) had more than 5 AN.
TN or AN and Tumor Thickness
In the crude analysis (ignoring cells with <10 cases), a strong
direct relationship between TN or AN and tumor thickness was
found (Table 2). The mean tumor thickness decreased from
2.33 mm for 0 to 20 TN and 0 AN to 1.12 mm for more than 50

TN and 0 AN. Thickest melanomas were found for individu-
als with 20 to 50 TN and at least 1 AN.
Associations of Nevi With Tumor Thickness
We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to test
the relationship between the number of TN or AN and tumor
thickness (≤2.00 vs ≥2.01 mm), with separate models for pa-
tients younger than 60 years and 60 years or older (Table 3).
The results were similar between the 2 models, and these data
confirmed the findings from the crude analysis. For those
younger than 60 years, the presence of more than 50 TN was
associatedwithasharplyreducedriskofthickmelanoma,with
age-adjusted and fully adjusted ORs of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.12-
0.81) and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.11-1.12), respectively. Compared with
no AN, the presence of more than 5 AN was associated with
thicker melanoma, with age-adjusted and fully adjusted ORs
of 2.43 (95% CI, 1.02-5.75) and 2.89 (95% CI, 0.96-8.72), re-
spectively. These associations were not found in the older pa-
tients; however, the numbers with many TN or AN were small,
and the 95% CIs were wide.
Discussion
Three notable findings emerged from this case study of 566
patients from 2 states newly diagnosed as having melanoma
in 2 states. First, overall, most patients had 0 to 20 TN and no
AN, and this finding was most pronounced among older pa-
tients, for whom both TN and AN were uncommon. Second,
aftercontrollingforpotentialconfounders,ahighermolecount
(>50 TN) was associated with thinner melanoma (≤2.00 mm)
for those younger than 60 years. Third, paradoxically, the pres-
ence of more than 5 AN was associated with thicker mela-
noma for patients younger than 60 years.
TN and AN
Having many TN or any AN is often reported to be a major risk
factorformelanomabypublicadvocacyorganizations.4,5How-
ever, it appears from the present large case series that many pa-
tients with melanoma do not routinely have an increased mole
count or AN. Herein, among 566 patients, we found that 66.4%
(n = 376)ofpatientshadfewTN(0-20),and73.3%(n = 415)had
no AN. Among those 60 years or older, only 19.0% (47 of 247)

that the total nevus count rose rapidly in the second decade
of life and was highest in the third decade, with a mean of 33
nevi for women and 22 nevi for men. Thereafter, the nevus
count slowly dropped until the eighth decade, when one typi-

the total nevus count reached a peak of 6.7 nevi in those 20 to
39 years old before declining. A study8 of 379 patients in
Sweden 30 to 50 years old found that mole counts were not
affected by age within this group. A study9 of 59 Australians
60 to 89 years old found a reduction in the nevus count with
increasing age, which tended to be due to the disappearance
of reticular nevi, whereas structureless and intradermal (Unna
and Miescher) nevi persisted with older age. Halpern et al10
studied 153 US patients and found that the total nevus count
and dysplastic nevi both decreased with age.
While the number of nevi after midlife decreases, the risk
for melanoma continues to increase. It has been estimated that
the risk of any individual nevus becoming melanoma is low,11
especiallyinyoungerindividuals,whiletheremainingnevithat
persist into old age may have an increased risk of malignant
transformation, although this concept remains unproven.11 It
has been suggested that there are 2 subsets of nevi develop-
ment. The first is the congenital type, which follows the junc-
tionaltodermalevolutionandpersiststhroughoutlife,andthe
second is the acquired type, usually reticular via dermos-
copy, which is positively influenced by sun exposure, grows
superficially within the skin, and usually disappears over time.
These2typeshavebeenfoundtobemolecularlydifferent,with
the congenital type having BRAF mutations much more
frequently than the acquired type.12
TN, AN, and Tumor Thickness
We explored the relationship between TN or AN and tumor
thickness, testing 2 different hypotheses. First, we hypoth-
esized that patients with more TN and AN would have thicker
melanomabecauseofthedifficultyofself-monitoringandphy-
sician monitoring. Second, we alternatively hypothesized that
patients with more TN and AN would have thinner mela-
noma because of more vigilant care, as determined by the re-
ported number of patient visits in the year before diagnosis.
Younger patients with more than 50 TN had 3 times the
likelihood of being diagnosed as having thinner melanomas
than those patients with few (0-20) or some (20-50) TN. Vir-
tually no differences were found whether one controlled only
for age or for age and multiple confounders. For older pa-
tients, a relationship was not apparent in the multivariable
analysis, although this lack of a finding may be explained by
the fact that there were only 10 patients 60 years or older with
more than 50 nevi.
Fewpriorinvestigationshaveexploredtherelationshipbe-
tween nevus count or type and tumor thickness. Cadby et al13
found that individuals who reported having no nevi had an in-
creased Breslow thickness compared with individuals who re-
ported having nevi, when adjusted for age at diagnosis. Liu et
al14 found a significant association between the rate of growth
of melanoma and the number of nevi. Specifically, individu-
als with fewer nevi had a faster melanoma growth rate. How-
ever, the association between the presence of nevi and Bres-
low thickness may have been confounded by melanoma type
because thicker melanomas tend to be of the nodular variety,
which are known to be associated with fewer nevi.14
Most recently, Ribero et al15 found that high nevus counts
conferred a favorable prognosis, with markedly improved
5-year and 10-year survival rates for those with more than 50
moles exceeding 2 mm in diameter. The number of AN was not
reported. Rather than being behaviorally driven, the authors
suggested a different biological behavior of melanomas in
patients with high nevus counts.
One can only speculate as to the key results of our analy-
sis, namely, that younger individuals have an increased like-
lihood of thinner melanomas in the setting of a higher total ne-
vus count but a decreased likelihood of a thinner tumor if they
have a higher atypical nevus count. Thinner melanomas in pa-
tients with more TN might be due to a less aggressive biologi-
cal behavior of melanoma and a tendency of these patients to
have their moles checked more frequently, whereas having
more AN may make discovery by either the patient or his or
her physician more difficult because the true “outlier” mela-
nomamaybelesseasilyrecognized.Thislatterexplanationmay
relate to pattern recognition, such that it is easier for a person
with many common nevi to see the “ugly duckling” outlier ne-
vus compared with an individual with many AN, which share
clinical features with melanoma but are rarely true mela-
noma precursors. Regardless of the method of detection (by
self,other,orphysician),therelationshipbetweentumorthick-
nessandnevipersistedforyoungercases.Therelationshipwas
stronger with the cutoff of 2.00 mm relative to 1.00 mm, sug-
gesting that the biological behavior of intermediate-
thickness melanoma (1.01-2.00 mm) best reflects this
phenomenon of tumor thickness and TN or AN.
Strengths and Limitations
This study has several strengths. All patients were surveyed
within 3 months of diagnosis to reduce potential recall bias
(most case surveys were conducted within 6 weeks of diag-
nosis), although patients were asked to describe their SSE and
PSE practices in the 12 months before survey administration.
Also, using established clinical guidelines, an experienced pig-
mented lesion specialist at each institution performed counts
of TN and AN at the first visit after diagnosis. Pathology re-
ports, including anatomic location of melanoma, histologic
subtype, and tumor thickness, were available for all 566 cases.
The study is limited by small numbers in certain sub-
groups and by the use of broad categories (eg, the lowest single
threshold for TN included individuals who had as few as 0 nevi
and as many as 20 nevi). It also is limited by studying pa-
tients at academic centers rather than a more population-
based sample, although patients were referred from the sur-
rounding regions at both sites. There is also the possibility of
biological factors related to age, presence of nevi, and tumor
thickness that were not examined in this study that could be
the focus of future research. Finally, other risk factors, such
as family history of melanoma or personal history of skin can-
cer, and their relationship to these findings should be
explored in larger databases.

Conclusions
Several novel public health messages emerge from our study,
including that melanomas are more commonly diagnosed in
individuals with fewer nevi compared with those with a high
mole count. Therefore, physicians and patients should not rely
on the total nevus count as a sole reason to perform skin
examinationsortodetermineapatient’
sat-riskstatus.Younger
and middle-aged patients with an increased total nevus count
have a lower risk of thick melanoma, but this age group has
higher rates of thick melanoma if they have more than 5 AN.
These younger patients should be educated on the increased
risk of thicker melanomas that is associated with having more
AN, the clinical features of which should be taught in the
practice setting.
