Abstract
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease associated with obesity, insulin
resistance and hypoinsulinemia due to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Reduced mitochon-
drial function is thought to be central to β-cell dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction and
reduced insulin secretion are also observed in β-cells of humans with the most common
human genetic disorder, Down syndrome (DS, Trisomy 21). To identify regions of chromo-
some 21 that may be associated with perturbed glucose homeostasis we profiled the gly-
caemic status of different DS mouse models. The Ts65Dn and Dp16 DS mouse lines were
hyperglycemic, while Tc1 and Ts1Rhr mice were not, providing us with a region of chromo-
some 21 containing genes that cause hyperglycemia. We then examined whether any of

 these genes were upregulated in a set of ~5,000 gene expression changes we had identi-
fied in a large gene expression analysis of human T2D β-cells. This approach produced a
single gene, RCAN1, as a candidate gene linking hyperglycemia and functional changes in
T2D β-cells. Further investigations demonstrated that RCAN1 methylation is reduced in
human T2D islets at multiple sites, correlating with increased expression. RCAN1 protein
expression was also increased in db/db mouse islets and in human and mouse islets
exposed to high glucose. Mice overexpressing RCAN1 had reduced in vivo glucose-stimu-
lated insulin secretion and their β-cells displayed mitochondrial dysfunction including hyper-
polarised membrane potential, reduced oxidative phosphorylation and low ATP production.
This lack of β-cell ATP had functional consequences by negatively affecting both glucose-
stimulated membrane depolarisation and ATP-dependent insulin granule exocytosis. Thus,
from amongst the myriad of gene expression changes occurring in T2D β-cells where we
had little knowledge of which changes cause β-cell dysfunction, we applied a trisomy 21
screening approach which linked RCAN1 to β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction in T2D.
Author Summary
Mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion are key features of β-cell dys-
function in Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by
trisomy of chromosome 21 that also displays β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction and
reduced insulin secretion in humans. Given these similarities in β-cell dysfunction in T2D
and DS, we developed a trisomy 21 screening method to identify genes that may be impor-
tant in T2D. This approach used different DS mouse models combined with human gene
expression data from T2D β-cells. From this we identified a single candidate, Regulator of
calcineurin 1 (RCAN1). High RCAN1 expression occurs in human and mouse T2D islets.
Increased RCAN1 expression in mice reduced β-cell mitochondrial function and ATP
availability, and this has negative implications for multiple ATP-dependent steps in glu-
cose-stimulated insulin secretion.
Introduction
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disorder characterised by elevated blood glucose
levels. Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and reduced insulin output in the presence of insulin resis-
tance is the primary cause of T2D. The mechanisms leading to a switch from β-cell compensa-
tion during the early stages of insulin resistance to β-cell failure in the latter stages remain
unknown. Studies from human T2D islets provide the most direct evidence regarding the
nature of such β-cell changes. Reduced β-cell mass and insulin content is observed in T2D [1],
but these are not insurmountable given the capacity of sulphonylureas, GLP-1 agonists or bar-
iatric surgery to restore insulin secretion and plasma glucose in T2D patients. Clearly alterna-
tive pathways exist to drive β-cell dysfunction and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion (GSIS). For example, oxidative stress is increased in human T2D β-cells and nega-
tively correlates with GSIS impairment [2]. T2D β-cells also display marked mitochondrial dys-
function; characterised by a reduced respiratory response to glucose [3] in association with
lower ATP levels [4]. Given that mitochondrial function is central to oxidative stress, ATP pro-
duction and GSIS in β-cells, and that these are major defects in T2D β-cells, identifying the

 genes responsible for β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction is essential to further our understanding
of the mechanisms controlling β-cell function.
As one approach to identifying causative genes, several genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have compared gene expression changes in healthy and T2D human patients (see [5]
for full details) and gene array and proteomic studies have been conducted on T2D islets [6,7].
The largest such study involved 89 donors and identified 4,920 gene expression changes using
RNA Sequencing in T2D islets [8]. However, identifying which of these changes are function-
ally relevant to β-cell dysfunction in T2D is a significant challenge.
Interestingly, islets derived from fetal Down syndrome (DS) tissue exhibit β-cell mitochon-
drial dysfunction, low ATP levels and reduced insulin secretion [9]. We have therefore
exploited the phenotypes shared by β-cells derived from DS and T2D islets in an attempt to
detect functionally relevant genes in human islets that underlie β-cell dysfunction in T2D.
Using this approach we identified a single lead candidate, a gene called Regulator of calcineurin
1 (RCAN1), which is overexpressed in T2D islets and when overexpressed in mouse islets,
causes β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP production to inhibit insulin
secretion.
Results
A DS screening approach identifies that RCAN1 is overexpressed in
human and mouse Type 2 diabetes islets
To screen for chromosome 21 genes that may contribute to diabetes, measured fasting blood
glucose levels (in mM) were measured in 4 mouse models of DS; Ts65Dn, Dp16, Ts1Rhr and
Tc1 (Fig 1A). These transgenic mouse lines either have a partial or whole trisomy of mouse
chromosome 16 (largely homologous to human chromosome 21) or contain an incomplete
freely segregating human chromosome 21 (Tc1) (Fig 1F). We found that Ts65Dn (control
8.0 ± 0.3, n = 17 vs Ts65Dn 10.9 ± 0.9, n = 14, p < 0.01) and Dp16 (control 9.7 ± 0.5, n = 10 vs
Dp16 12.1 ± 0.9, n = 11, p < 0.05) mice were hyperglycaemic, Ts1Rhr mice were normoglycae-
mic (control 11.1 ± 0.6, n = 18 vs Ts1Rhr 11.5 ± 0.4, n = 12), and Tc1 mice were hypoglycaemic
(control 13.6 ± 0.6, n = 23 vs Tc1 9.4 ± 0.5, n = 23, p < 0.001). Ts65Dn mice (Fig 1B and 1C)
demonstrated poorer glucose tolerance (measured by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests
(IPGTT)) but no change was observed in the Tc1 mouse line (Fig 1D and 1E). These data indi-
cated that a subset of chromosome 21 genes contributed to the development of glucose intoler-
ance and hyperglycaemia. Mapping the trisomic regions of chromosome 21 unique to Ts65Dn
and Dp16 mice amongst these lines identified a region of 38 candidate genes that contains
genes that must contribute to the hyperglycaemic phenotype (Fig 1F).
We next used RNA Seq data from human islets from a Swedish study obtained from 89
donors (77 non-diabetic (ND, HbA1c <6.5%) and 12 T2D (HbA1c >6.5%) [8] to identify
whether any of these 38 genes have increased expression in T2D islets. Five genes were signifi-
cantly up regulated; EVA1C (p = 0.038), OLIG2 (p = 0.009), IFNAR1 (p = 0.021), RCAN1
(p = 0.009) and RUNX1 (p = 0.0003) (Fig 1F). EVA1C is a Slit receptor involved in Robo-medi-
ated axonal guidance [10], OLIG2 regulates spinal cord oligodendrocyte and motor neuron
development [11], IFNAR1 is an interferon receptor with no role in the initiation or progres-
sion of diabetes [12] and RUNX1 is involved in haematopoiesis [13]. Only RCAN1 has any
known role in affecting mitochondrial function [14] or insulin secretion when either chroni-
cally overexpressed in mouse islets [15] or transiently transfected into a mouse β-cell line [16].
RCAN1 is highly abundant in human islets, being in the top 13% most highly expressed
genes across the genome [8]. In human T2D islets, gene expression of RCAN1 was 153% of
that in ND islets (Fig 2A). RCAN1 expression correlated significantly with the clinical measure

 of long-term glycaemic status, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c, Fig 2B) and BMI (S1A Fig)
across all samples. When RCAN1 expression was separated across HbA1c categories, we found
that expression in islets from HbA1c >6.5% (T2D) was higher than that in healthy islets
(HbA1c <6%) but not different to those with impaired glucose tolerance (HbA1c 6–6.5%)
(S1B Fig), indicating that islet RCAN1 expression increases after insulin resistance has
occurred. Furthermore, this human islet data was consolidated by global islet genome expres-
sion data from an earlier study [17] that profiled gene expression in islets from an obesity-
induced diabetes-resistant mouse strain and from a diabetes-susceptible mouse strain before (4
weeks of age) and after (10 weeks of age) the onset of diabetes. This mouse islet data demon-
strated that mouse islet RCAN1 expression is correlated with increased plasma triglycerides
(S1C Fig) and increased body weight (S1D Fig), both of which are associated with T2D in
humans.
To understand more about RCAN1 in human T2D islets, we analysed previously published
data using the Infinium 450k array to examine global changes in DNA methylation in human
T2D islets [18]. Compared to the non-diabetic group, RCAN1 had the fifth largest difference in
methylation across the entire analysed genome in T2D islets, and the largest difference in

 methylation of all analysed chromosome 21 genes [18]. Additionally, of all 16 analysed RCAN1
methylation sites on the 450k array, 3 show a significant negative correlation across all samples
between methylation status and RCAN1 expression (Fig 2C–2E). Importantly, these 3 sites also
displayed significant reductions in methylation in T2D islets from 51.1 ± 1.8% in non-diabetic
islets (n = 34) to 40.2 ± 3.1% in T2D islets (n = 15, p<0.01, data is mean ± SEM) at site
cg05156137, 57.9 ± 1.9% vs 48 ± 3.2% (p<0.01) at cg21301258 and 42.3 ± 1.5% vs 29.5 ± 1.9%
(p<0.001) at cg05056497 [18]. Thus, our data demonstrated that RCAN1 expression is linked
to hyperglycaemia in DS mice, it correlated in islets with a worsening metabolic profile in
obese mice, and it is increased in human T2D islets. Furthermore, RCAN1 methylation at
three different sites correlated with RCAN1 expression in human islets and methylation status
at these sites is reduced in T2D islets. This combination of multiple data sets strongly supports
the concept that RCAN1 expression is increased in T2D β-cells.
We next confirmed whether human islets express the RCAN1 protein. RCAN1 has two iso-
forms called RCAN1.1 and RCAN1.4 (S2D Fig). Each differs in their start exon but both con-
tain common exons 5, 6 and 7. Exon 7 contains the calcineurin binding motif [19] and both
isoforms are thought to have shared functions as inhibitors of calcineurin. Western blot analy-
sis revealed that RCAN1.1 and RCAN1.4 isoforms were both present (Fig 2F), with the
RCAN1.1 isoform expression ~4 fold higher, similar to mouse islets and the mouse MIN6 β-
cell line, an insulinoma cell line derived from a transgenic mouse expressing the large T-anti-
gen of SV40 in pancreatic β-cells (Fig 2G). We observed a significant increase in RCAN1.1 and
RCAN1.4 protein (Fig 2H) in islets from the leptin receptor deficient T2D mouse model, db/db
(12 week old males, db/+ weight = 22.5 ± 1.1 g, plasma glucose = 8.5 ± 0.3 mM, db/db
weight = 46.6 ± 1.1 g, plasma glucose = 24.1 ± 1.4 mM). RCAN1.1 expression was ~10 times
that of RCAN1.4 in db/db islets (Fig 2I). Prolonged exposure to high glucose also induced
RCAN1 expression in human islets (Fig 3A), mouse islets (Fig 3B) and MIN6 cells (Fig 3C).
This induction was reversed when Ca2+ entry was reduced with the L-type Ca2+ channel
blocker nifedipine (Fig 3D and 3E) or by inhibiting oxidative stress with the antioxidant N-
acetylcysteine (NAC) (Fig 3F and 3G). Thus, increased Ca2+ and oxidative stress both induced
β-cell RCAN1 expression under hyperglycaemic conditions and RCAN1.1 is the major
RCAN1 isoform in human and mouse β-cells.
Overexpression of RCAN1 in mice reduces in vivo GSIS
We measured in vivo GSIS in mice overexpressing RCAN1.1 (henceforth referred to as RCA-
N1ox) as reduced GSIS is a hallmark in T2D individuals [14,15,20], and as RCAN1.1 is the
major β-cell RCAN1 isoform with the greatest increase in db/db islets. Basal plasma insulin lev-
els were not different (Fig 4A) but in vivo GSIS is reduced in RCAN1ox mice (Fig 4B and 4C).
This is similar to findings demonstrating that transient overexpression of RCAN1 in a β-cell
line reduced in vitro GSIS [16]. This reduced in vivo GSIS in RCAN1ox mice is not due to
increased insulin sensitivity, as these mice demonstrated no change in insulin tolerance (Fig
4D and 4E) or in plasma glucagon levels (Fig 4F).
Overexpression of RCAN1 causes β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction
We then tested whether increasing RCAN1 affects β-cell mitochondrial function, as the focus
of this study is to identify potential regulators of mitochondrial dysfunction in T2D β-cells.
Islets from RCAN1ox mice have double the RCAN1.1 gene expression and a 2.5 fold increase in
protein level [14], similar to the increase in RCAN1.1 protein expression that we report here in
db/db islets. Islet respiration (oxygen consumption rate) was assessed in RCAN1ox and wild-
type (WT) islets (Fig 5A). At both 3mM and 20mM glucose RCAN1ox islets had a significantly

min/μg protein and 20mM WT 4.11 ± 0.76 vs RCAN1ox 1.89 ± 0.49 pmoles /min/μg protein,
Fig 5B). Uncoupled respiration due to proton (H+) leak (measured in the presence of oligomy-
cin) was also significantly lower in RCAN1ox islets (WT 1.28 ± 0.34 vs RCAN1ox 0.48 ± 0.26
pmoles/min/μg protein, S3A Fig). Basal mitochondrial respiration was significantly decreased
and respiration due to ATP turnover showed a trend towards reduction in RCAN1ox islets
(S3B and S3C Fig) demonstrating a consistent respiratory defect with RCAN1 overexpression
across multiple aspects of mitochondrial function.
Unsurprisingly, ATP levels were reduced in RCAN1ox islets (Fig 5C). To understand
whether these changes are due to alterations upstream of the mitochondrial electron transport
chain or could be directly attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction, we stimulated complex II of
the electron transport chain directly with methyl succinate. This resulted in significant insulin
secretion from WT islets but far less in RCAN1ox islets (Fig 5D), indicating a respiratory defect
within the mitochondria downstream of complex I. Since RCAN1 interacts with the

 mitochondrial ATP translocator, ANT, in Drosophila neurons [21], we used the ANT inhibitor
carboxyatractyloside (CAT) to test whether the effect of RCAN1 on mitochondrial function in
β-cells is mediated through changes in ANT function. CAT significantly reduced GSIS in WT
islets, but had no effect in RCAN1ox islets (Fig 5E). RCAN1 does not have a classical N-termi-

 further demonstrate that RCAN1 does not localise to mitochondria in MIN6 cells (Fig 5F–5H).
While some overlap was observed due to the nature of co-localisation studies, we believe the
data does not support a mitochondrial localisation of RCAN1. No fluorescence was detected
when the primary antibody was replaced by either saline or non-immune rabbit serum, and
used with the secondary antibody as negative controls.
RCAN1 regulates mitochondrial membrane potential
To further understand how mitochondrial output is diminished in RCAN1ox β-cells, we first
measured the protein expression of various mitochondrial markers. No changes in the expres-
sion of TOM20 (marker of total mitochondrial protein), NDUFA9 (complex I), SDHA (com-
plex II), or CORE1 (complex III) were observed, and a lack of OPA1 cleavage infers
mitochondrial fission was unaltered (Fig 6A). Electron microscopy analysis of mitochondrial
area in β-cells further demonstrated no change in the absolute (Fig 6B) or relative (Fig 6C) area
of mitochondria in RCAN1ox β-cells. We observed the same outcome when measuring mito-
chondrial volume using the mitochondrial marker tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester
(TMRM) in live cells (Fig 6D). We observe increased TMRM fluorescence in RCAN1ox β-cells

 at rest, indicative of mitochondrial hyperpolarisation (Fig 6E). Furthermore, while a normal
mitochondrial hyperpolarisation in response to glucose [23] was observed in WT cells, no such
response occurred in RCAN1ox cells (Fig 6E). Thus, the mitochondrial electrochemical gradi-
ent is altered in RCAN1ox β-cells and does not change in response to high glucose.

Having established that mitochondrial function and ATP output are compromised in RCA-
N1ox β-cells, we next tested whether this is functionally relevant for specific ATP-dependent
components of the GSIS pathway. Mitochondria are central to ATP production in response to
high glucose in β-cells. This triggers closure of plasma membrane KATP channels, membrane
depolarisation, Ca2+ entry and insulin secretion. Perforated patch whole cell voltage clamp
recordings from single β-cells were used to measure K+ currents in WT (Fig 7A) and RCAN1ox
(Fig 7B) β-cells. This established that the average current-voltage relationships were identical
in these cells (Fig 7C). In the presence of 20mM glucose, the K+ current amplitude produced by
this same voltage pulse protocol was reduced in WT β-cells and caused a rightward shift in the
current-voltage relationship near the reversal potential, indicative of membrane depolarisation
(S4A Fig). However such a change was diminished in RCAN1ox β-cells (S4B Fig). To measure
membrane potential directly, current clamp recordings, still obtained in the perforated patch
clamp configuration to maintain the endogenous intracellular ATP concentration, were under-
taken. These demonstrated that WT (Fig 7D) and RCAN1ox (Fig 7E) β-cells were both depo-
larised and fire action potentials in response to high glucose and had similar resting membrane
potentials (WT -67.4 ± 1.4 mV, n = 7, RCAN1ox -65.3 ± 3.4 mV, n = 10). However, the amount
of glucose-induced membrane depolarisation was less in RCAN1ox β-cells (p < 0.01, Fig 7F).
Addition of the KATP channel antagonist, tolbutamide, caused membrane depolarisation in
WT (Fig 7G) and RCAN1ox β-cells (Fig 7H) to the same extent (Fig 7I). Similarly in voltage
clamp mode, tolbutamide caused equal changes in K+ current amplitude and the estimated
reversal potential in both WT (S4C Fig) and RCAN1ox (S4D Fig) β-cells. Thus, the decreased
ATP production in RCAN1ox β-cells reduced glucose-induced closure of plasma membrane
KATP channels to limit glucose-induced membrane depolarization.
Reduced ATP availability in RCAN1ox β-cells decreases depolarization-
induced insulin exocytosis
As ATP is also required for vesicle transport in β-cells [24], we utilized membrane capacitance
measurements to test if RCAN1 overexpression negatively affects insulin exocytosis. We ini-
tially used the perforated patch clamp mode to maintain endogenous intracellular ATP con-
centrations. A series of ten depolarizing pulses resulted in an increase in membrane
capacitance in WT (Fig 8A) and RCAN1ox β-cells due to insulin exocytosis but this secretion
was not sustained in RCAN1ox β-cells (Fig 8B). This was not due to altered Ca2+ current size
(Fig 8C). Given ATP production is low in RCAN1ox β-cells; we then punctured the cell mem-
brane using the whole cell patch clamp approach in order to introduce an equal amount of
ATP (3mM) into the β-cell cytosol in both groups via the pipette solution. Under these condi-
tions we observed robust secretion in WT and RCAN1ox β-cells (Fig 8D) that is similar in both
groups (Fig 8E). Ca2+ current size is the same in these groups (Fig 8F). Thus, a lack of ATP in
RCAN1ox β-cells has negative effects directly on vesicle fusion.

 Discussion
In this study we attempted to identify genes that regulate mitochondrial function in β-cells and
underlie mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced GSIS in T2D β-cells. This approach produced
a single candidate, RCAN1, which is overexpressed in human T2D islets. We validated our
screening approach by establishing that higher RCAN1 levels caused mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion resulting in low ATP levels in β-cells. This reduced ATP availability has direct functional

 consequences on glucose-stimulated membrane depolarisation as well as depolarisation-
induced insulin exocytosis. Further investigation revealed that increased RCAN1 hyperpo-
larises the mitochondrial membrane and blunts the respiratory output of β-cell mitochondria.
Thus, this approach enabled the identification of a single candidate gene, from 4,920 genes
with altered expression in T2D islets [8], that is capable of causing mitochondrial dysfunction
and reduced insulin secretion.
T2D is a complex multi-systemic metabolic disorder with β-cell dysfunction at its core.
Islets isolated from T2D patients have lower ATP levels [4] and elevated ROS accumulation
that correlates with the impairment of GSIS [25] which is reversed in human T2D islets pre-
treated with anti-oxidants [26]. Such data highlights the central role of oxidative stress and
impaired mitochondrial function in T2D β-cell dysfunction.
Islets from DS individuals display fragmented mitochondria and reduced insulin secretion
[9] and similar changes are seen in human T2D β-cells. While the mechanisms underlying
these mitochondrial changes in DS β-cells remain poorly defined, DS individuals also have
mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress in a number of other cell types
[9,27,28]. The early onset of mitochondrial dysfunction in fetal DS β-cells is indicative of
genetic mechanisms driving this phenotype. Our observation that the trisomy 21 mouse

 models, Ts65Dn and Ts16, are hyperglycaemic, and that Ts65Dn mice have impaired glucose
tolerance, indicates that some mouse chromosome 16 genes regulate blood glucose levels and
potentially β-cell function. This hyperglycemia may well be due to reduced β-cell output, simi-
lar to that observed in human DS islets [9]. As Tc1 and Ts1Rhr mice are not hyperglycaemic,
and Tc1 mice have normal glucose tolerance, we were able to refine the list of candidate genes
to 38. Of these, five were overexpressed in T2D islets; EVA1C, OLIG2, IFNAR1, RCAN1 and
RUNX1. RCAN1 was of particular interest when focusing on mitochondrial function and insu-
lin secretion. We note that we have not confirmed that RCAN1 expression is increased in
human DS islets or in islets from mouse models of trisomy 21. However given that neuronal
expression of RCAN1 is almost double that of normal [29], we assume that this is similar in
mouse models triplicating RCAN1 such as Ts65Dn and Tc1. Given that the altered mitochon-
drial morphology observed in human DS β-cells [9], is not seen in our β-cells overexpressing
RCAN1, chromosome 21 genes other than RCAN1 may also cause some of the pathological
changes in DS β-cells. We must emphasize here that the DS screening approach was not used
to provide a guide on DS genes that cause hyperglycemia or β-cell dysfunction, but rather as a
tool to help identify genes important in β-cell dysfunction in T2D from a study that had yielded
almost 5000 gene expression changes.
The relationship between DS and diabetes is both poorly studied and highly complex. While
the incidence of T1D is increased in the DS population [30,31], few publications exist regarding
the incidence of T2D. One such study indicates an increased incidence of T2D in DS individu-
als [32] and high fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance are more prevalent in the DS pop-
ulation [33,34]. However the increased prevalence of obesity in this population needs to be
considered. The diagnosis of young DS individuals with T1D is not always based on an
increased incidence of β-cell autoantibodies [31], and clarification in a larger study will be
needed to clearly identify whether these cases are truly autoimmune T1D or a genetically-
caused early onset form of diabetes associated with chromosome 21 genes being overexpressed.
It is also worth noting that fine mapping of a region on chromosome 21 that shows linkage to
T1D contains RCAN1 [35]. Given that increased hypoinsulinemia has been long reported in
the DS population [36] and that β-cell dysfunction and low insulin release is seen even in fetal
DS islets [9], DS individuals may have the capacity to cope with this through other genetically
induced changes that increase, for example, peripheral insulin sensitivity. The hypoglycaemia
observed in the Tc1 mouse model indicates there may be some chromosome 21 genes that
would provide beneficial effects on glycemic control in diabetes. This idea is reinforced in the
human insulin-dependent DS population who require a lower dose of insulin compared with
age-matched insulin-dependent diabetics [37]. Further study into whether some chromosome
21 genes could be responsible for improved insulin sensitivity or reduced insulin secretion are
worthy of future investigation.
RCAN1 is a stress-induced protein known to regulate mitochondrial function in neurons
[14,21,38]. RCAN1 overexpression increases mitochondrial ROS in neurons and pancreatic
islets, and reduces GSIS [14,15]. As such, it was our lead candidate from the results of our
screening approach. The DNA methylation data in human T2D islets adds key mechanistic
insight to explain how RCAN1 expression is increased in T2D β-cells. Reduced RCAN1 methyl-
ation was found to correlate with increased RCAN1 expression at three different sites, and it
was only at these sites that the methylation status was reduced in T2D islets. What drives these
methylation changes in β-cell RCAN1 during T2D is an important question worth addressing
in the future. Our Western blot data from db/db mouse islets illustrates that RCAN1 protein
expression increases in T2D islets, and that RCAN1.1 is 10 times more highly expressed than
RCAN1.4 in db/db islets. Such data is a good illustration that gene changes may not reflect pro-
tein expression given the 50% increase in RCAN1 gene expression in T2D islets vs. 3 fold

 increased RCAN1.1 protein expression in db/db islets. It also highlights the fact that genome-
wide expression screens may miss important targets that have small gene, but large protein,
expression changes. As such, approaches such as GWAS, as well as our DS-based approach,
will be limited in their scope in this respect. RCAN1.1 and RCAN1.4 expression were also ele-
vated in response to glucose in MIN6 cells. This was driven by Ca2+ and oxidative stress, con-
sistent with the mechanism of RCAN1 induction in neurons [39]. Thus, we demonstrate that
RCAN1 expression is linked to hyperglycaemia in DS mice, that it correlates in islets with a
worsening metabolic profile in obese mice, that it is increased in human T2D islets, that
RCAN1 methylation at three methylation sites correlates with RCAN1 expression in human
islets and that methylation status at these sites is reduced in T2D islets. This is further consoli-
dated by protein expression data demonstrating not only that RCAN1.1 and RCAN1.4
increases in db/db islets but that chronic high glucose increases expression of both RCAN1 iso-
forms in islets through a mechanism that involves increased Ca2+ and oxidative stress. Ca2+
entry is thought to be increased in T2D β-cells due to chronic high glucose levels and oxidative
stress is linked to the degree of GSIS impairment in human T2D islets. This data strongly sup-
ports the concept that RCAN1 expression increases in T2D β-cells and that this is driven my
cell stresses that are relevant to the pathogenesis of β-cell failure in T2D.
The effects on β-cell function that we attribute to RCAN1 overexpression in our transgenic
mice are consolidated by the findings of others using independent models. This includes the
finding that transient overexpression of RCAN1 reduces GSIS in a β-cell line [16] and signifi-
cantly, that β-cell number and islet size are reduced, as reported in our RCAN1ox line [15], in
mice overexpressing RCAN1 created independently of our study [40]. Thus is appears unlikely
that off-target effects related to transgene insertion in our RCAN1ox mice drive the phenotypes
we observe here.
We demonstrate that increased RCAN1 inhibits ATP production and mitochondrial func-
tion. The lack of succinate-induced insulin secretion clearly identifies defective mitochondrial
respiration in RCAN1ox β-cells, but exactly what drives this is unclear. ANT exports ATP out
of the mitochondrial matrix while importing ADP. Disruption of ANT reduces cellular ATP
levels and inhibits the electron transport chain, resulting in reduced oxygen consumption
rates, such as we observe in RCAN1ox islets. In one respect, our data is consistent with findings
in Drosophila neurons that RCAN1 interacts with and blocks ANT activity when overexpressed
and reduces cytosolic ATP levels [21]. Our finding that mitochondria are hyperpolarized in
RCAN1ox β-cells could be explained by reduced ANT output because a decrease in cellular
ATP levels, resulting in increased substrate entry into the electron transport chain. However, if
ATP is trapped in the mitochondria due to defective nucleotide transport, ATP synthase, and
therefore respiration, will be inhibited. As electrons continue to enter the electron transport
chain, protons will continue to be pumped into the inner membrane space and membrane
potential will increase as we observed in RCAN1ox β-cells in 3 mM glucose. This situation also
occurs in our WT β-cells in the presence of increased glucose, except that as ATP is exported
from the mitochondria in these cells, respiration increases. However, as we do not observe a
clear mitochondrial localisation of RCAN1 in β-cells a direct interaction between RCAN1 and
ANT seems unlikely. We suggest alternatively that inhibiting ANT activity in RCAN1ox β-cells
did not reduce insulin secretion because the mitochondria is already hyperpolarised and added
glucose cannot drive further respiration in RCAN1ox β-cells.
We observe RCAN1 MIN6 cell localisation in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. This is some-
what in contrast to similar experiments showing little β-cell nuclear localisation [15]. RCAN1
is normally expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with the degree of nuclear localisa-
tion being cell-type dependent [41]. RCAN1 nuclear localisation is significantly reduced in the
presence of activated calcineurin [42]. As calcineurin activity is regulated acutely by calcium,

 differences in RCAN1 localisation could readily be caused by small differences in experimental
conditions such as culture media, temperature, buffer capacity of solutions and any stress
placed upon the cells. This should be kept in mind when comparing cytosolic and nuclear
RCAN1 localisation. No evidence suggests that these factors affect mitochondrial localisation
of RCAN1, but it is worth considering given that this has been reported in Drosophila neurons
[21].
The mitochondrial respiratory defects we observe in RCAN1ox β-cells are not associated
with altered mitochondrial morphology. The expression of TOM20, a marker of total mito-
chondrial protein, is unchanged and electron microscopy analysis and mitochondrial staining
indicate that mitochondrial mass is unchanged in β-cells overexpressing RCAN1. The reduced
oxygen consumption rate we observe at baseline in RCAN1ox islets is therefore not due to
reduced mitochondrial mass. Some reduction in mitochondrial size is reported in RCAN1ox β-
cells but this is far less than that reported in neurons [14,21,38]. Whether such differences are
strain or cell type dependent is unknown but our data shows that overt morphological changes
are not required for RCAN1 to cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial and cyto-
plasmic calcineurin activity increases in response to changes in cytosolic Ca2+ in β-cells [43].
While the functional roles of altered calcineurin activity in different intracellular locations is
not clear, increased RCAN1 would be expected to suppress at least some of them, potentially
including mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. As RCAN1 is not present in β-cell mito-
chondria, other possibilities such as changes in calcineurin-dependent gene expression will
need to be investigated. Indeed, in skeletal muscle, calcineurin can regulate the expression of
some mitochondrial genes [44]. Whether such a mechanism exists in β-cells remains, to our
knowledge, unknown. We hypothesise that the expression of unidentified mitochondrial pro-
teins are altered in RCAN1ox β-cells, resulting in reduced nucleotide transport and hyperpolar-
isation of the mitochondrial membrane, to reduce glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.
Our patch clamp studies provide a functional link between RCAN1-induced mitochondrial
dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion. The fact that tolbutamide had the same effect in
WT and RCAN1ox β-cells, but that high glucose had a reduced effect on membrane depolarisa-
tion in RCAN1ox cells is clear evidence that glucose-induced KATP channel closure is hindered
in RCAN1ox β-cells. Biphasic glucose stimulated insulin secretion is reduced in T2D islets
[25,45] and we demonstrate here the same phenotype in RCAN1ox islets. Unaltered insulin
sensitivity and glucagon release in RCAN1ox mice provides further support that the reduced in
vivo GSIS we observe in RCAN1ox mice is due to β-cell failure. Glucose metabolism raises the
cellular ATP/ADP ratio in β-cells to close KATP channels, depolarise the plasma membrane
and open voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to trigger insulin granule exocytosis. Whether mem-
brane depolarisation is reduced in T2D β-cells as we observe in RCAN1ox β-cells is unknown,
but might be assumed given the reduced glucose oxidation [25] and ATP production [4]
reported in human T2D islets.
The use of whole cell capacitance to provide 3mM ATP to these β-cells demonstrates that a
lack of ATP drives the low exocytosis phenotype in RCAN1ox β-cells. The fact that we were
able to rescue this exocytosis phenotype with a single molecule (i.e.; ATP) is a very strong indi-
cator that low ATP levels are responsible for the secretory defect observed in RCAN1ox β-cells.
The earliest phase of exocytosis represents release of docked insulin granules, while the slower
second phase requires granule recruitment from the reserve pool in an ATP-dependent man-
ner [24]. Our capacitance data shows the readily releasable vesicle pool is not affected in RCA-
N1ox β-cells, which is unsurprising given insulin granule localisation is unchanged in
RCAN1ox β-cells [15]. It appears that RCAN1ox β-cells produce enough ATP under basal con-
ditions for vesicle docking and priming to occur, and defects in exocytosis are only observed
under stimulated conditions where rapid ATP generation is required. Our data also

 demonstrates that perforated patch clamp should be used in such experiments so as to avoid
artefacts produced by washout of cytoplasmic second messengers.
This genetic screening approach we have developed combining different trisomy 21 mouse
models with whole genome data from human T2D islets has identified a potential regulator of
β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction in T2D. This work goes well beyond previous findings related
to the function of RCAN1 by identifying it, through an unbiased multi-centre screening
approach, as a lead candidate in the control of whole body glucose metabolism and in the β-
cell dysfunction which is central in humans to the transition from insulin resistance to T2D.
Furthermore, our data demonstrating that RCAN1 methylation is reduced at multiple sites in
human T2D β-cells and that methylation status at these sites correlates with RCAN1 expression
is further validation of our screening approach and provides a mechanistic pathway that clearly
explains how RCAN1 expression changes in T2D β-cells. Similarly, such an approach could be
applied to other human health disorders with phenotypes shared with DS individuals. Given
the large number of gene changes observed in complex human diseases like T2D, such an
approach could aid in deciphering the complex data sets now being obtained with ever improv-
ing genetic search tools. An example of this provided by this present study is insulin resistance,
as the hypoglycaemic status of Tc1 mice indicates that chromosome 21 genes unique to this DS
mouse model may improve some aspects of insulin sensitivity. This may have clinical applica-
tions for T2D research also, given the importance of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of
this disease.
Materials and Methods
Mouse lines
3–5 month old male mice were used in this study with approval from the individual institu-
tional animal welfare committees at each site. Dp(16Cbr1-ORF9)1Rhr (called Ts1Rhr) [46],
Dp(16)1Yey (called Dp16) [47] and Ts65Dn [48] mice were maintained on a B6EiC3Sn/J back-
ground. Tc1 mice (called Tc1TybEmcf) [49] were bred by crossing female Tc1 mice to male
(C57BL/6JNimr x 129S8/Nimr) F1 mice. Mice homozygous for the diabetes spontaneous
mutation (Leprdb), named here as db/db mice, were maintained on a C57BL/KsJ background.
RCAN1ox mice are transgenic C57BL/6xCBA mice stably overexpressing human RCAN1.1
[20]. While multiple RCAN1ox founder lines were originally generated, only a single line was
used for this study. We observed no overt differences between the three RCAN1ox lines initially
created, but these investigations were unrelated to glucose metabolism.

out with the approval of the Ethical Review Board and under Licence from, and following
guidelines provided by, the UK Home Office. At the Garvan Institute, procedures were
approved by the Garvan Institute/St.Vincent’s Hospital Animal Experimentation Ethics Com-

versity of California Irvine (UCI) institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC)
(approval number: 2008–2779) following guideline provided by that body.
Fasting glucose and glucose tolerance measurements
Blood was collected from mice fasted for 6 hours. For Ts65Dn, Dp16 and Ts1Rhr mice, blood
was obtained from tail tips and glucose measured using a One-Touch Ultra Blood Glucose
Monitoring System (LifeScan, Milpitas, CA, USA) or Contour Blood Glucose Monitoring Sys-
tem (Bayer HealthCare, Mishawaka, IN, USA). For Tc1 mice, blood was collected from the
retro-orbital sinus and measured using an AU680 clinical chemistry analyser (Beckman Coul-
ter, Brea CA, USA). After 12–16 hour overnight fasting, glucose tolerance was measured by
administering intra-peritoneal glucose (2.0 g/kg).
RNA sequencing
Islets from 89 cadaver donors (77 control and 12 T2D) of European ancestry were provided by
the Nordic Islet Transplantation Programme and processed as described [8].
Human islets
Pancreases were removed from heart beating deceased donors and disaggregated by infusing
the ducts with cold collagenase (NB1 GMP grade from SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany). Disso-
ciated islet and acinar tissue were separated on a continuous Biocoll (Biochrom AG, Berlin)
density gradient (polysucrose 400 and amidotrizoic acid) on a refrigerated apheresis system
(Model 2991, COBE Laboratories, Lakewood, CO.)
Mouse pancreatic islets and MIN6 β-cell line
Pancreatic islets isolated from age matched, male C57BL/6 × CBA wild type (WT) and trans-
genic mice stably overexpressing human RCAN1.1 (RCAN1ox) [20] were used in all experi-
ments. Experiments were approved by the Flinders University Animal Welfare and
Institutional Biosafety Committees. Mice were killed by an anaesthetic overdose of isoflurane
and islets isolated as previously described [15]. MIN6 cells, an insulinoma cell line derived
from a transgenic mouse expressing the large T-antigen of SV40 in pancreatic β-cells (passage
number 37–39), were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) media (11.1
mM glucose, 15% fetal calf serum) at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Islet RNA was extracted using QIAshredder columns and an RNAeasy minikit (Qiagen). All
RNA samples were subjected to a DNAse treatment to remove any genomic DNA (TURBO
DNA-free kit, Life Technologies) prior to reverse transcription (Omniscript, Qiagen). Quanti-
tative real-time PCR analysis was carried out in triplicate utilising SyBR-Green (Qiagen). All
results were normalised to β-actin expression which was used as a house-keeping gene. Mean
normalised expression values and fold gene expression were calculated using Qgene Module
software.

 SeahorseXF analysis
The respiratory responses of islets isolated from wild type and RCAN1ox mice were assessed
using the Seahorse XF24 Flux Analyser (Seahorse Bioscience). Islets were washed in DMEM
(3mM glucose, 1mM pyruvate, 1mM glutamate, 1% fetal bovine serum) and approximately 50
islets were added to each well of a 24-well XF24 islet capture microplate. Islets were incubated
at 37°C in a non-CO2 incubator for 1hr prior to bioenergetics assessment. Six basal oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) measurements were performed using the Seahorse analyser and mea-
surements were repeated following injection of 20mM glucose, 5μM oligomycin, and 1μM
Antimycin A. Respiratory parameters of mitochondrial function were calculated as described
previously [50]. Non-mitochondrial respiration was subtracted from all mitochondrial respira-
tion parameters. Following the assay, protein content of each well was assessed by standard
BCA assay (Thermo Fisher). Mitochondrial respiration was normalised to total islet protein
content.
Western blot analysis
25 μg of islet or mitochondrial protein lysates were separated on a Criterion-TGX stain-free gel
(Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive proteins were visualised on a Fuji-Film LAS4000 and Gel-Doc Ez-
Imager (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies; anti-RCAN1 (1:200, Sigma Aldrich), anti-TOM20
(1:1000, Jackson Laboratories), anti-β-actin (1:200, Sigma Aldrich), anti-NDUFA9 (1:1000,
Sigma Aldrich), anti-SDHA (1:2000, Sigma Aldrich), anti-CORE1 (1:1200, Sigma Aldrich) and
anti-Opa1 (1:1500, Sigma Aldrich). Secondary antibodies; donkey anti-rabbit horse-radish per-
oxidase (HRP) (1:100, Life Technologies) and donkey anti-mouse HRP (1:100, Life
Technologies).
Electrophysiology
Whole-cell patch clamp recording was performed using an EPC‐10 patch clamp amplifier and
PatchMaster software (HEKA Electronik GmbH). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate
glass and fire polished, with resistance of 3–5 MO. Patch clamping was performed in the perfo-
rated patch configuration for capacitance measurements, with internal solution containing
(mM): 140 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 0.5 CaCl2 and 10 Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.2, and with
240 μg ml−1 amphotericin B. For whole cell capacitance measurements, amphotericin was
removed and 3mM ATP added. External solution contained (mM): 140 NaCl, 5 Hepes, 2
MgCl2 and 10 CaCl2 and, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Capacitance measurements utilized
the Lock-in module of the PatchMaster software, with capacitance change measured in
response to 10 voltage steps to 10mV of 500 ms duration at 1Hz from a resting membrane
potential of −80 mV. Internal solution for measurement of K+ currents and membrane poten-
tial was (mM): 10 NaCl, 145 KCl, 10 Hepes, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.2. External
solution was (mM): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 10 Hepes, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2 adjusted to pH 7.4. Cells
were identified on their response to high glucose and/or having a whole cell capacitance over
5pF. Experiments were carried out at 22–24°C.
ATP content
ATP content of groups of 80 islets in the presence of 20 mM glucose was measured using a
commercially available bioluminescent ATP quantitation kit (Sigma Aldrich) as per the manu-
factures instructions. ATP content was normalised to total protein content.

 Insulin and glucagon measurements
Insulin secretion assays from isolated islets were carried as previously described [15]. For some
experiments, potassium carboxyatractyloside (200 μM) or methyl-succinate (10 mM) were
added. Plasma glucagon was measured from mice fasted for 2 hours using an ELISA (Crystal
Chem, USA). The in vivo GSIS measurements were undertaken on mice fasted for 2 hours and
2mg/g body weight of glucose (PharmaLab, Australia) was injected (i.p.) into mice and blood
glucose measured at various interval from 0 to 60 minutes via a tail bleed. Insulin was quanti-
fied using an Ultra Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA Kit (Crystal Chem, USA) as per the manu-
facturer’s instructions for a low range assay. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm and 620 nm
using a BIOMECK-3000 micro-plate reader (Beckman-Coulter, USA) and MultiMode detec-
tion software.
Insulin tolerance test
Insulin tolerance tests were carried on mice fasted for 1 hour and 0.75 units/kg body weight
insulin (Novo Nordisk, Australia) was injected (i.p.) into 40 day old mice. Blood glucose was
measured via a tail bleed using an ACCU-CHEK Performa glucometer (Roche Diagnostics,
Australia).
Mitochondrial analysis
Mitochondrial volume was calculated from electron micrographs obtained as previously
described [15]. Total mitochondrial volume per cell was calculated from these images using
ImageJ image analysis software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) after sub-
traction of the nuclear volume. This was calculated as both absolute volume and the volume
fraction of the entire β-cell. Relative volume was also calculated from isolated cells loaded for
30 min with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, 1μM). Images were analysed using
the masking function in the Image J digital image analysis software (National Institute of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured as the mean
cell fluorescence of cells loaded with TMRM. Images were captured under identical conditions
for all groups and data presented as mean TMRM fluorescence in each group.
RCAN1 methylation analysis
DNA methylation profiling of human pancreatic islets was performed at the SCIBLU genomics
center at Lund University with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.,
San Diego, CA). The experimental and bioinformatics analyses have previously been described
[18]. In short, DNA from human pancreatic islets was bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA
Methylation Kit D5001 (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Bisulfite converted DNA was amplified, fragmented and hybridized to the BeadChips
following the standard Infinium protocol. T2D islet samples were randomized across the chips
and all samples were analyzed on the same machine by the same technician to reduce batch
effects. The DNA methylation data were exported from GenomeStudio and Bioconductor and
the lumi package were used for further analyses. Individual probes were filtered based on their
mean detection P-value and those with a P-value > 0.01 were excluded from further analysis.
M-values were calculated from β-values using the following equation: M = log2 β-value / (1-β-
value) and were then used for further statistical analysis. To identify differences in DNA meth-
ylation between T2D and non-diabetic islets a linear regression model was used including
batch, gender, BMI, age, islet purity and days of culture as covariates and DNA methylation as

 the quantitative variable. As the β-value is easier to interpret biologically, M-values were con-
verted to β-values when describing the results and creating the figures.
Mitochondrial RCAN1 localisation
Cells were incubated with MitoTracker Red (1μM) at 37°C for 15 min and then fixed with 4%
formaldehyde for 15 min at 22°C. The cells were stained with anti-RCAN1 antibody (1:100)
and FITC conjugated antibody (1:100) as previously described [51]. The cells were viewed
under laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, FV1000-IX81 Japan) using a 40X oil
immersion lens. Multitrack scanning mode was used to record single- and double-labelled
cells.
Statistical analysis
Parametrically distributed data were analysed using a Student’s unpaired t test and a Mann-
Whitney U test was used to analyse nonparametric data sets. Statistical significance was p <
0.05. All data are shown as mean ± SEM.
