Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Epidemiological studies have identified sev-
eral traits associated with CHD, but few of these have been
shown to be causal risk factors and thus suitable targets for
treatment. Our aim was to evaluate the causal role of a large
set of known CHD risk factors using single-nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables.
Methods Based on published genome-wide association stud-
ies (GWASs), we estimated the associations between the
established risk factors (blood lipids, obesity, glycaemic traits
and BP) and CHD with two complementary approaches: (1)
using summary statistics from GWASs to analyse the
accordance of SNP effects on risk factors and on CHD; and
(2) individual-level analysis where we constructed genetic risk
scores (GRSs) in a large Finnish dataset (N=26,554, CHD
events n=4016).
We used a weighted regression-based method for
summary-level data to evaluate the causality of risk factors.
The associations between the GRSs and CHD in the Finnish
dataset were evaluated with logistic and conditional logistic
regression models.
Results The summary-level data analysis revealed causal
effects between glycaemic traits (insulin and glucose) and
CHD. The individual-level data analysis supported the causal
role of insulin, but not of glucose, on CHD. The GRS for
insulin was associated with CHD in the Finnish cohort (OR
1.06 per SD in GRS, 95% CI 1.02, 1.10, p=0.002).
Conclusions/interpretation These results support the causal
role of insulin in the pathogenesis of CHD. Efficient treatment
and prevention of insulin resistance is essential to prevent
future CHD events.

Introduction
Prospective cohort studies have identified several risk factors
for CHD, including high LDL- and low HDL-cholesterol,
obesity, glycaemic traits and high BP. The slow progress of
the disease and the potential for reverse causation and con-
founding make it difficult to infer the causal relationships
between the risk factors and CHD using traditional epidemi-
ological methods or intervention studies.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are usually consid-
ered a gold-standard method to establish causality. For exam-
ple, RCTs have shown that lowering LDL-cholesterol levels
with statin treatment reduces cardiovascular events [1–3],
which confirms the causal role of LDL-cholesterol in CHD.
In contrast, even though low levels of HDL-cholesterol are
associated with increased CHD risk, treatment that elevates
HDL-cholesterol levels has not been successful in CHD pre-
vention [4]. The causal role of many other CHD risk factors,
such as glycaemic traits and obesity, still needs to be
determined.
Genetic data can be used to infer causal relationships be-
tween risk factors and disease in a more cost-effective way
compared with traditional RCTs. As genotypes are determined
at conception, they are unaffected by reverse causation and
confounding and, thus, genetic data can be used to reveal causal
and mechanistic insights leading to CHD. Genome-wide asso-
ciation studies (GWASs) have uncovered genetic variants
robustly associated with various phenotypes. There is a grow-
ing number of studies demonstrating how the genetic data can
be used to assess causal relationships between risk factors and
disease. For example, studies using summary-level data from
GWASs have supported the causal role of blood triacylglycer-
ols, but not HDL-cholesterol, on CHD [5, 6].
In this study, our objective was to simultaneously evaluate
the causal role of several CHD risk factor traits by using
genome-wide genetic data from large-scale GWASs [7–12].
We studied associations between the established risk factors
(blood lipids, obesity, glycaemic traits and BP) and CHD with
two complementary approaches: (1) using summary statistics
from GWASs to analyse the accordance of SNP effects on risk
factors and on CHD; and (2) individual-level analysis where
we constructed genetic risk scores (GRSs) in a large Finnish
dataset (N=26,554, CHD events n=4016).
Methods
Genetic marker selection
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be used as
instrumental variables in Mendelian randomisation (MR)
analysis to assess causality of risk factors on disease. The valid
instrument should be associated with the outcome only
through the risk factor of interest, i.e. it should not have pleio-
tropic effects through other risk factors. Weak intruments and
pleiotropic effects are common challenges of genetic instru-
ments. Inclusion of a high number of SNPs increases the pow-
er of the instrument, but it also increases the risk of pleiotropy.
On the other hand, excluding SNPs based on observed asso-
ciations with other traits to minimise pleiotropic effects could
lead to weak intrument bias. Mechanistic SNP exclusions
based on pre-defined statistical thresholds might also exclude
SNPs that are not pleiotropic, but have effects for other traits
on the same causal pathway than the risk factor of interest
(Fig. 1), which does not violate the causal inference. In this
study, rather than excluding SNPs to decrease the risk for
pleiotropy, we applied methods that take pleiotropic effects
into account at the modelling phase [5, 13, 14].
For our analyses, we selected all SNPs associated with
established CHD risk factors and CHD at genome-wide sig-
nificance level from the largest GWASs for each trait (for
lipids n = 188,577, for BMI n = 339,224, for WHR
n = 224,459, for glycaemic traits n = 133,010, for BP
n=200,000, for CHD n=184,305) [7–12] (electronic supple-
mentary material [ESM] Table 1). For each SNP, we obtained
effect estimates for LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycer-
ols, BMI, WHR, fasting insulin and glucose, systolic and
diastolic BP and CHD from the public databases of published
GWASs. The effect sizes for lipids and obesity traits are in SD
units from inverse normal-transformed traits. Fasting insulin
results are in ln-transformed units for fasting insulin. Data on
lipid traits have been contributed by Global Lipids Genetics

Summary-level data analysis
To evaluate the causal effects of risk factor traits on CHD,
we applied a statistical method that controls for pleiotropic
effects, noted as ‘weighted regression-based method’ [14].
This method has been described in Do et al and Burgess
et al [5, 14]; in short, we extracted the SNP effect estimates
for LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols, BMI,
WHR, fasting insulin and glucose, systolic and diastolic
BP, and CHD from the summary result files of reference
GWASs. As some of the reference GWASs were conducted
by using cardio-metabochip data, we were able to find 278
SNPs that had effect estimates available for all traits. In
addition, we removed SNPs based on their high correlation
with other SNPs (r2 > 0.5), as strong linkage disequilibrium
(LD) between the SNPs might result in too narrow CIs [13].
This resulted in 257 SNPs. Pairwise SNP correlations were
estimated using the Finnish population cohort FINRISK.
To further evaluate the pleiotropy assumption, we applied
a sensitivity analyses with the R package gtx (version 0.0.8,
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtx/index.html). In
this method, SNPs are removed based on the null
hypothesis that they affect disease risk only through their
effects on the trait of interest (i.e. they have no pleiotropic
effects). The details of this method are provided in Johnson
[15]; in short, the SNPs are filtered stepwise until there is no
significant heterogeneity (p ≤ 0.05) of the SNP effects on
CHD risk relative to the effects on the risk factor of
interest. In addition, the effect of influential observations
was evaluated using the Cook’s D statistic.
The association between the SNP effects on the trait of
interest (βTrait_1) and CHD (βCHD) were tested with a linear
regression model. The effects of genetic variants on other risk
factor traits were taken into account in the modelling so that
the SNP effects on other traits (βTrait_2,…,βTrait_n) were
included as covariates in the linear regression model. The
regression model parameters were estimated using weights
defined by inverse standard errors of βCHD to account for
uncertainty of the β coefficients [14].
Individual-level data analysis
Study cohorts The prospective study population consists of
19,751 individuals from four FINRISK studies with risk factor
and genome-wide genetic marker data. Each FINRISK study
is a random sample drawn from the 25–64- or 25–74-year-old
inhabitants in different regions of Finland. Extensive indepen-
dent surveys were conducted in 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007,
and hospitalisation and mortality data for study participants
were obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge
Register and the Finnish National Causes-of-Death Register.
CHD was defined as myocardial infarction, unstable angina
pectoris, coronary revascularisation, or death due to CHD
(ICD-9 codes 410-414, 798 [www.icd9data.com/2007
/Volume1] and ICD-10 codes I20-I25, I46, R96, R98 [www.
who.int/classifications/icd/en/]). The registry-based follow-up
ended on 31 December 2013.
The data were genotyped in six batches with Illumina 610K,
Illumina Omni Express, Illumina HumanCoreExome and
Affymetrix 6.0. SNPs with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE) p value<1×10−6, call rate<95% (99% for SNPs with
minor allele frequency [MAF] < 5%) were excluded. For
Illumina 610K, Illumina Omni Express and Affymetrix 6.0
MAF≤1% were excluded. In HumanCoreExome data, mono-
morphic markers and singletons were excluded. Each subset was
imputed with IMPUTE 2 [16] by using the 1000 genomes ref-
erence panel (September 2013 release). After imputation, data
were merged with qctool software (version 1.4, www.well.ox.ac.
uk/~gav/qctool/#overview). The FINRISK study was approved
by the ethical committee of the National Public Health Institute,
Helsinki, Finland. Participants gave written informed consent.
The DIetary, Lifestyle, and Genetic determinants of
Obesity and Metabolic syndrome (DILGOM) study is a
subcohort of FINRISK 2007. The cohort has detailed pheno-
typic information on metabolic traits (including the oral glu-
cose tolerance test) and genetic data genotyped with the
Illumina cardio-metabochip. In this study, 3971 individuals
from the DILGOM study sample were used for sensitivity
analysis of glycaemic traits.
The Corogene cohort is a case–control dataset including
2113 Finnish CHD patients and their matched controls [17].
CHD patients were collected from the Helsinki University
Hospital in 2006–2008, where CHD was defined as coronary
artery obstruction > 50% in at least one coronary artery.
Controls were collected from the FINRISK participants living
in the Helsinki-Vantaa region. For each CHD case, two

 controls were matched by sex and birth year. The data were
genotyped with Illumina 610K and the same pre-imputation
quality control was applied as for FINRISK. Data were im-
puted with IMPUTE 2 by using the 1000 genomes reference
panel (September 2013 release). The Corogene study was
approved by the ethics committee of Helsinki University
Hospital. Participants gave written informed consent.
The Genmets cohort is a case–control study for the meta-
bolic syndrome, sampled from the Health 2000 survey [18].
Half of the study participants were defined to have the meta-
bolic syndrome based on IDF criteria, and and half of the
study participants were their matched controls. Prevalent
CHD was determined at baseline based on self-reports and
clinical diagnoses made by the field physicians. The genetic
data were genotyped with Illumina 610K and the same quality
control was applied as for FINRISK and Corogene cohorts.
Data were imputed with IMPUTE 2 by using the 1000
genomes reference panel (September 2013 release). For the
present study, a total of 1998 individuals were included for the
analysis. The Health 2000 study was approved by the ethical
committee of the National Public Health Institute, Helsinki,
Finland. Participants gave written informed consent.
Statistical methods
Imputation quality for all selected SNPs was good (informa-
tion score>0.8), thus there was no need to exclude any SNPs
based on the imputation quality. We calculated GRSs for each
trait as a weighted sum of the risk alleles and divided by the
number of SNPs in each score, after which GRSs were
standardised (mean = 0, SD = 1). Effect estimates obtained
from discovery GWASs were used as the weights [7–11].
There was a high correlation between systolic BP (SBP)-
GRS and diastolic BP (DBP)-GRS (r=0.87). Otherwise, the
correlations were modest (|r|<0.41, ESM Fig. 1).
The associations between the GRSs and CHD events were
estimated with logistic regression and conditional logistic
regression models. Analyses were conducted separately in
FINRISK, Corogene and Genmets study cohorts. We first
fitted the models individually for each GRS, and then com-
bined them into a single model to reduce the effect of pleio-
tropic SNPs that are included in more than one GRS. DBP-
GRS was not included in the joint model because of its high
correlation with SBP-GRS. In FINRISK, we adjusted the
models for age, sex, cohort indicator and genotyping batch.
To avoid overlap with the Corogene cohort, those individuals
used as controls in Corogene were excluded from the
FINRISK dataset. In Corogene, we studied the association
with conditional logistic regression analysis. In Genmets, we
used logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex and met-
abolic syndrome case status. The results from the three
datasets were combined with fixed-effects meta-analysis, as
no significant heterogeneity was detected (ESM Table 2).
We then performed some additional analyses in the
FINRISK cohort (N = 19,078, incident CHD events
n=1376), where the risk factor traits were measured at base-
line (1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007). We estimated the associa-
tions between the GRSs and risk factor traits. The measure-
ments of insulin and glucose were available only for a subset
of the data (n=12,754 for insulin, n=11,194 for glucose). The
trait distributions were inspected and outliers removed, and
log-transformation was applied to normalise triacylglycerols
and insulin. In the analyses for lipid traits, those individuals
receiving lipid-lowering medication were excluded. For BP
analyses, we added 15 mmHg for SBP and 10 mmHg for
DBP for individuals receiving treatment for high BP. For
glycaemic traits, diabetic individuals were excluded.
Associations between the GRSs and risk factor traits were
obtained with linear regression models adjusted for age, sex,
cohort indicator and genotyping batch. To evaluate causal
effects of risk factor traits on CHD, we applied the two-stage
least-squares (2SLS) method that controls for pleiotropic
effects of the GRSs. This is a two-step regression model,
where the risk factors are first regressed on the GRSs and then
the outcome is regressed on the fitted values of the risk factors
[13].
All analyses were done with the R statistical package (version
3.0.2).
Results
Summary-level data analysis
The effect estimates of SNPs for the traits are denoted as βLDL,
βHDL, βTG, βBMI, βWHR, βInsulin (βIns), βGlucose (βGlu), βSBP,
βDBP and βCHD. The results of the linear regression model
βCHD∼βLDL+βHDL+βTG+βBMI+βWHR+βIns are shown
in Table 1. The effects for glycaemic traits βIns and βGlu and
lipids βLDL and βTG were associated with βCHD after account-
ing for all other risk factor related SNP effects. Interestingly, the
effects for obesity traits βBMI and βWHR were also associated
with βCHD only when βIns was omitted from the model
(Table 2). Excluding other βs did not modify the results for
other predictors. This supports the previous findings that
LDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerols are causally related to
CHD, and suggests that insulin is a causal risk factor that might
explain the epidemiological associations between obesity traits
and CHD.
Our sensitivity analyses with gtx removed 68 SNPs based
on the null hypothesis of no pleiotropic effects. With 189
SNPs, the effect size for βIns was 0.80 (95% CI 0.55, 1.05;
p=2.5−9; Fig. 2a, b), which is comparable with the estimate of
βIns in Table 1. Cook’s D statistic indicated one influential
SNP (rs3184504, ESM Fig. 2), but removing this from the
model did not change the results (ESM Table 3). Finally, we
2372
Diabetologia (2016) 59:2369–2377
 performed the analysis without the SNPs with lower frequen-
cy (MAF <0.05) as they might have imprecise effect esti-
mates. This exclusion did not affect the results notably
(ESM Table 4).
Individual-level data analysis
Study characteristics The characteristics of the study cohorts
are shown in Table 3. Four FINRISK studies were initiated in
1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007, when the baseline information
was collected. The mean age at baseline was 47.9 years (SD
13.3 years) and 47.0% of participants were men and 53.0%
women. During the median follow-up of 14.5 years
(interquartile range 10.75–18.25), 1420 (7.2%) incident
CHD cases occurred. In total, 653 individuals had been diag-
nosed cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. The
Corogene study consisted of 2113 CHD events and 4440
matched controls (of whom 1576 were unique). The
Genmets cohort consisted of 1998 individuals of whom 99
(5%) had CHD at baseline.
Associations between GRSs, risk factors and CHD Among
nine GRSs for risk factor traits, BMI-, WHR- and insulin-
GRSs had individually significant associations with CHD
(Table 4). The estimates were largely similar in a multivariable
model with all GRSs tested simultaneously (BMI-GRSs: OR
1.08 per SD in GRS, 95% CI 1.04, 1.13, p=1×10−4; WHR-
GRS: OR 1.06 per SD in GRS, 95% CI 1.02, 1.10, p=0.003;
insulin-GRS: OR 1.05 per SD in GRS, 95% CI 1.01, 1.09,
p=0.025).
The analyses with risk factor data in the FINRISK cohort
showed that all the GRSs were associated with the corre-
sponding risk factor trait (p ≤ 1 × 10−8, ESM Table 5).
However, the 2SLS model yielded non-significant results for
all risk factors, probably because of lack of power and impre-
cise measurement of glycaemic traits due to inadequate fasting
(n=12,754 for insulin, n=11,194 for glucose with, on aver-
age, 5 h fasting). The modest association between LDL-GRSs
and CHD also suggests that the power of the GRSs to evaluate
causal process is relatively weak; in fact, the GRSs only
explained 0.3–7.3% of the trait variance (ESM Table 5).
As data for glycaemic traits were limited, we performed a
sensitivity analyses using the DILGOM metabochip data
with>8 h fasting (n=3971), from which we estimated the
effect of measured insulin levels on incident CHD. The effect
estimate of fasting insulin on CHD in the DILGOM cohort
was higher (HR 1.32 per SD in GRS, 95% CI 1.14, 1.53) than
in FINRISK (HR 1.18 per SD in GRS, 95% CI 1.12, 1.25).
This result illustrates how incomplete fasting can bias the
observational estimates of insulin. To further evaluate the abil-
ity of insulin-GRS to reflect insulin resistance, we studied
associations between insulin-GRS and different measure-
ments of insulin resistance in the DILGOM cohort. Insulin-
GRS was associated with fasting and 2 h insulin (insulin 2 h
after oral glucose tolerance test), HOMA-IR and insulin sen-
sitivity index (ISI) (ESM Table 6).
Discussion
We have shown evidence that glycaemic traits (insulin and
glucose) are causally related to CHD. Our results also support
the previous findings that triacylglycerols and LDL-
cholesterol are causal risk factors for CHD. Moreover, the
SNP effects for insulin explained the effects for BMI and
WHR, which suggests that the risk-increasing effect of obesity

 is at least partially mediated by insulin. This is in line with the
idea that healthy obesity (as occurs in 10–25% of obese indi-
viduals) is due to preserved insulin sensitivity [19]. Our results
from the individual-level data analysis supported the causal
role of insulin, but not glucose, on CHD.
Insulin resistance usually coexists with obesity, but not
always. For example, insulin resistance is common in some
populations with normal BMI [20]. The pathological role of
insulin resistance in CVD has been debated for decades. The
Helsinki Policemen Study was one of the first prospective
studies demonstrating associations between high plasma insu-
lin and incident CHD [21–23], stroke [24] and all-cause
mortality [25]. Further, other markers of insulin resistance,
namely HOMA-IR and ISI, have been shown to associate with
CVD risk independently of the metabolic syndrome [26–28].
Other studies, however, have shown that fasting insulin levels
predict the CVD risk only moderately and the effect is highly
dependent on the measurement assay used [29].
Contradictory results could be at least partly explained by
the limitations in observational epidemiological studies to
assess causality. Observational studies are prone to confound-
ing, reverse causality and multicollinearity, which could espe-
cially affect the traits that are measured with lower precision,
such as insulin resistance. The advantage of using genetic

 markers in epidemiological studies compared with traditional
risk factor traits is that it is possible to avoid most of these
common problems. However, it is probable that SNPs associ-
ated with direct measurement of insulin resistance (rather than
fasting insulin) would be more suitable genetic instruments for
causal analysis. As genetic loci associated with insulin
resistence will be identified, this hypothesis can be tested.
Nevertheless, the correlation between fasting insulin and the
gold-standard clamp measurement of insulin resistance is rea-
sonably high, and the measurements correlate similarly with

 metabolic and cardiovascular risks [30]. Thus, fasting insulin
is a useful marker of insulin resistance in large-scale studies
where it is not possible to conduct the clamp measurement.
To overcome the limitations of observational studies to
assess causality, many studies have used summary-level data
from GWASs to infer causal relationships between risk factors
and CHD [5, 6, 31, 32]. Yaghootkar et al [32] showed that a
GRS comprising SNPs associated with fasting insulin and
adverse metabolic profile, but lower BMI, is associated with
CHD. This is consistent with our finding that insulin is asso-
ciated with CHD independently of obesity. Our study has
several strengths compared with these studies. First, these
studies have only evaluated one or a few traits at a time (e.g.
lipids [5], BMI [31]). We are not aware of any other study that
takes genetic effects on multiple CHD risk factor traits into
account simultaneously. Second, the method for pleiotropic
SNP effects suggested by Do et al [5] has been criticised as
it does not account for uncertainty of the effect estimates [13].
In our analyses, we applied a simple modification of this
method that takes the uncertainty into account [14]. Third,
apart from studies using only summary-level data, we per-
formed complementary analysis in our study with the large
individual-level dataset with consistent disease event defini-
tions and genome-wide genetic data. In addition, by using the
population-based FINRISK cohort with extensive baseline
health information and follow-up data, we were able to esti-
mate the relationships between the GRSs, risk factor traits and
prospectively ascertained CHD events in the same dataset.
The diagnoses for incident CHD events in our data have been
obtained from validated national registries with comprehen-
sive coverage [33, 34].
Our study also has some limitations. First, we restricted our
analysis to lead SNPs with genome-wide significance.
Consequently, the variants only explain a small proportion
of trait variability. Identifying new loci for these traits could
highly increase the effect sizes between the GRSs and CHD
and increase the power in MR analysis. Another way to create
more powerful GRSs is to combine multiple genetic variants
from a single gene region. Even if the variants are correlated,
this method can provide more precise causal estimates [35].
Second, limited data of glycaemic traits restricted us to per-
form powerful multivariable analysis with measured risk fac-
tor data. Thus, individual-level analysis with detailed pheno-
typic and genetic information is required to further elucidate
the causal processes between insulin resistance and CHD.
Third, even though our statistical modelling approach and
sensitivity analyses minimise the potential for pleiotropic ef-
fects on our set of well-known CHD risk traits, it is possible
that the tested SNPs have large effects on other factors and
causal pathways leading to CHD. As further GWAS results for
potential risk factors are published, these can be added to the
future analyses of causality and thus minimise the possibility
of pleiotropy.
In summary, our findings from complementary summary-
and individual-level data analyses support the causal role of
insulin and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of CHD.
Efficient prevention and treatment of insulin resistance is
essential to prevent future CHD events.
