Summary
We identified a polyclonal CD8+ T-cell response against mutant KRAS G12D in tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes obtained from a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer. We observed objective 
regression of all seven lung metastases after the infusion of approximately 1.11×1011 HLA-
C*08:02–restricted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that were composed of four different T-cell 
clonotypes that specifically targeted KRAS G12D. However, one of these lesions had progressed 
on evaluation 9 months after therapy. The lesion was resected and found to have lost the 
chromosome 6 haplotype encoding the HLA-C*08:02 class I major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) molecule. The loss of expression of this molecule provided a direct mechanism of tumor 
immune evasion. Thus, the infusion of CD8+ cells targeting mutant KRAS mediated effective 
antitumor immunotherapy against a cancer that expressed mutant KRAS G12D and HLA-
C*08:02.
Adoptive cell therapy using ex vivo expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has led to 
durable complete regression of tumors in 20 to 25% of patients with metastatic 
melanoma.1,2 This effect is probably mediated by T cells that specifically target mutant 
peptides encoded by de novo somatic mutations, which are known as neoepitopes.3–8 
Correlative evidence suggests that clinical responses in patients with cancer after the 
administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors may also be mediated by neoepitope-
reactive T cells.9–14 Direct evidence of the therapeutic utility of the targeting of neoepitopes 
was observed in a patient with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma who had tumor regression that 
lasted for 35 months after the infusion of a 95% pure population of CD4+ T cells that 
targeted a mutated ERBB2IP epitope expressed by her tumors.15 Thus, strategies that 
harness a T-cell response against mutated tumor antigens may be of clinical benefit in 
patients with cancer.
The targeting of driver mutations is conceptually attractive, since they are tumor-specific, 
biologically important for tumor progression, and likely to be expressed by all tumor cells.16 
Mutations in the KRAS oncogene are frequent and contribute to the formation and 
progression of many human cancers. The vast majority of KRAS mutations are recurrent 
“hot-spot” driver mutations that occur at codon 12, 13, or 61, with codon 12 being the most

 frequent site of mutation. A conversion of the amino acid glycine (G) to aspartic acid (D) at 
this site, hereafter referred to as KRAS G12D, is the most frequent KRAS mutant in human 
gastrointestinal cancers and has been identified in approximately 45% of pancreatic cancers 
and 13% of colorectal cancers.17,18 Despite decades of study, there is currently no drug or 
vaccine that can effectively target the KRAS G12D protein in humans. Here, we describe the 
clinical and biologic findings in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer who underwent 
tumor regression after the administration of cytotoxic T cells targeting mutant KRAS G12D.
CASE REPORT
A 50-year-old woman with metastatic colorectal cancer (Patient 4095) was enrolled in our 
ongoing phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01174121), which was designed to 
test whether the adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 
containing T cells targeting personalized cancer neoepitopes (cell therapy) can mediate 
regression of metastatic solid cancers. (Details about the trial are provided in the protocol, 
available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) In this trial, we screen cultures of 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from each patient for reactivity against all identified 
mutant neoepitopes expressed by their autologous tumor. If we identify neoepitope-reactive 
cultures, these cultures are selected and used in autologous cell therapy, regardless of the 
identity of the targeted neoepitope.
In Patient 4095, baseline computed tomography (CT) revealed lung disease as the sole 
source of cancer progression. Three of 10 lung lesions (with maximum diameters of 0.6 cm, 
0.8 cm, and 1.0 cm) were resected with the use of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery 
(VATS), and 24 individual cultures of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were generated from 
multiple tumor fragments. Samples of the 3 lesions also underwent whole-exomic 
sequencing (median sequencing depth of lesions: 128, 131, and 163) and transcriptome 
sequencing to identify mutations expressed by the tumors. (See the Methods section and 
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. The whole-exome and 
transcriptome sequence data are available through the National Center for Biotechnology 
Information BioProject database at identification number PRJNA342632.)
We evaluated each culture for reactivity against these mutant neoepitopes and found that the 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes contained CD8+ T cells that specifically recognized mutant 
KRAS G12D (Fig. S1A and S1B in the Supplementary Appendix). We selected the culture 
that showed the highest frequency of CD8+ T cells that were reactive to the G12D mutant 
and expanded it for treatment (Fig. S1B and S1C in the Supplementary Appendix). Before 
cell infusion, the patient received a nonmyeloablative, lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (at a dose of 60 mg per kilogram of body weight) 
for 2 days, followed by fludarabine (25 mg per square meter of body-surface area) for 5 
days.19
The patient received a single infusion of 1.48×1011 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which 
consisted of approximately 75% CD8+ T cells (1.11×1011 cells) that were reactive to mutant 
KRAS G12D and that had no detectable reactivity against the patient’s other mutations (Fig. 
S1C in the Supplementary Appendix). The majority of these T cells produced multiple

 effector cytokines (interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-2) and showed 
cytolytic potential (Fig. 1A). This therapy was followed by the administration of five doses 
of interleukin-2 (720,000 IU per kilogram), which was limited because of fatigue reported 
by the patient.
All seven metastatic lung lesions had regressed at the first follow-up visit conducted 40 days 
after cell therapy, and the patient had a 9-month partial response (according to the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) until one lesion (lesion 3) had progression (Fig. 1B). 
This lesion was resected, and the patient remained clinically disease-free 4 months after the 
lung resection.
METHODS
IDENTIFICATION OF NEOEPITOPE-REACTIVE T CELLS AND GENERATION OF INFUSION 
PRODUCT
To test whether tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that were obtained from the patient 
recognized somatic neoepitopes expressed by the metastatic lung tumors, we used a method 
that has been described previously.3,15,20 (Details are provided in the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix.) Culture number 6 of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 
contained the highest frequency of CD8+ T cells that were reactive to the KRAS G12D 
mutant; these cells underwent a 2-week rapid-expansion procedure before cell infusion, as 
described previously.15
IN VIVO TRACKING OF T-CELL CLONES
We performed deep sequencing on the variable region of the T-cell receptor beta chain on 
genomic DNA isolated from the patient’s infusion product, on three separate lung nodules 
before treatment, on the progressing lesion (lesion 3), and on peripheral blood before and at 
various times after cell infusion (Adaptive Biotechnologies) to interrogate the frequency of 
T-cell receptors that were reactive to the G12D mutant.
ASSESSING REACTIVITY OF T-CELL RECEPTORS
We identified four T-cell receptors that were reactive to mutant KRAS G12D. (See the 
Methods section and Figs. S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.) We synthesized the 
alpha- and beta-chain sequences of the T-cell receptors, which were then cloned into the 
MSGV1 retroviral vector (GenScript). Retroviral supernatants encoding the T-cell receptors 
were generated and used to transduce autologous peripheralblood T cells, as described 
previously.20 T cells that were transduced with the T-cell receptors were then cocultured 
with autologous peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) loaded with titrated doses of 
various KRAS peptides or KRAS G12D–positive pancreatic-cancer cell lines that either 
stably expressed or did not express the restricting HLA-C*08:02 allele.20 T-cell reactivity 
was determined the next day by means of interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot 
(ELISPOT) assay and flow cytometric analysis of the T-cell activation markers 4-1BB and 
OX40.20

 CHROMOSOMAL COPY-NUMBER ANALYSIS
We used Sequenza software21 to determine aberrations in tumor chromosome copy numbers, 
with normal samples as reference and hg19 coordinates. We determined tumor HLA-C allele 
frequencies as described in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix.
RESULTS
CLINICAL EVALUATION
At the first follow-up 40 days after cell therapy, we found that all seven lung metastases had 
regressed on CT. Of these lesions, six had either completely regressed or showed continuing 
regression 9 months after therapy (Fig. 1B). The therapy had no adverse effects after the 
patient had recovered from the effects of interleukin-2 treatment. The patient was discharged 
from the hospital 2 weeks after cell therapy. A VATS resection of the left lower lung was 
performed at approximately 9 months after cell therapy to remove the sole progressing 
lesion (lesion 3) as well as a responding lesion (lesion 2), which was negative on positron-
emission tomography. Pathological analysis of tissue sections from lesion 2 (performed with 
hematoxylin and eosin staining) showed extensive necrosis and no live tumor cells.
IN VIVO FREQUENCY OF KRAS G12D–REACTIVE CD8+ T CELLS
The infusion product contained at least four T-cell clonotypes that were reactive against the 
G12D mutant. The three highest-frequency T-cell receptors in the infusion product were 
reactive to KRAS G12D and made up 49.5%, 19.1%, and 6.9% of the infusion bag, 
respectively. A fourth KRAS G12D–reactive T-cell receptor was the 45th most frequent and 
was present at only 0.04% of the infusion bag (Fig. 2A, and Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). None of these KRAS G12D–reactive T-cell receptors were detected in the 
patient’s peripheral blood 1 week before infusion (frequency, <0.0002%). After cell therapy, 
dramatic differences in the engraftment of the KRAS G12D–reactive T-cell receptors were 
observed. The most dominant infused T-cell clonotype (approximately 7.3×1010 cells) was 
not detected in the blood 40 days after cell therapy, whereas the remaining KRAS G12D–
reactive T-cell clones were detected at this time point. The T-cell clones that persisted in the 
peripheral blood represented 10.4%, 4.5%, and 0.005% of all peripheral-blood T cells at 
approximately 9 months after cell therapy, and the most dominant T-cell clone in the 
peripheral blood at that time was the TRBV10-02 mutant KRAS G12D–reactive T-cell 
receptor (Fig. 2A, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). There did not appear to be 
an enrichment of the T-cell clones that were reactive against KRAS G12D in the progressing 
tumor relative to the peripheral blood.
SPECIFICITY AND SENSITIVITY OF KRAS G12D–REACTIVE T-CELL RECEPTORS
We cloned the four KRAS G12D–reactive T-cell receptors and genetically modified 
autologous peripheral-blood T cells to express each of these receptors (Fig. S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Three of the four T-cell receptors were preferentially reactive 
against the KRAS G12D peptide GADGVGKSA (consisting of 9 amino acids [9mer]), 
whereas one T-cell receptor was reactive only against the KRAS G12D peptide 
GADGVGKSAL (consisting of 10 amino acids [10mer]) (Fig. 2B). All T-cell receptors were

 specific for the mutant and did not recognize the wild-type KRAS peptides. In peptide 
titration experiments, we found that the T-cell receptors recognized peptides at 
concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 10 nM when pulsed onto autologous PBMCs (Fig. 2B). 
Although we did not have any autologous tumor cell lines to use as targets, we found that 
the T-cell receptors specifically recognized allogeneic pancreatic-cancer cell lines only when 
they expressed both mutant KRAS G12D and the HLA-C*08:02 allele (Fig. 2C).
GENETIC ANALYSIS OF TUMORS
Whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing revealed that the sole progressing lesion still 
expressed the KRAS G12D mutation (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). This 
finding showed that the loss of the targeted antigen was not responsible for the progressive 
nature of the lesion. However, chromosomal copy-number analysis showed that the 
progressing lesion harbored several genetic abnormalities distinct from the other tumors that 
had been resected before cell therapy, including a copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity at 
chromosome 6, which encodes the HLA locus (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The copy of chromosome 6 that was lost encoded the HLA-C*08:02 allele (Fig. 3). Thus, 
the genetic loss of the HLA-restriction element that was required for recognition by the 
KRAS G12D–reactive T cells provided a direct mechanism of immune evasion by the 
progressing lesion.
DISCUSSION
We report the regression of metastatic colon cancer followed by immune evasion of one 
lesion after the adoptive transfer of T cells specifically targeting mutant KRAS G12D. The 
four identified KRAS G12D–specific T-cell clonotypes showed highly variable levels of 
engraftment in the peripheral blood after treatment. Flow cytometric analysis of the infused 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with the use of KRAS G12D–specific tetramers showed that 
the highest persisting reactive T-cell clone, which recognized the KRAS G12D 10mer 
epitope, contained an increased frequency of T cells expressing CD28 and CD57 as well as 
T cells that had a central memory phenotype (CD45RO+CD62L+) that was less 
differentiated than those of other T cells in the infusion product (Fig. S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Currently, 12 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers have been treated with various 
frequencies of prospectively identified T cells targeting personalized mutated neoantigens. 
However, the patient who is described in this report was the only one who was treated with 
an enriched population of T cells targeting mutant KRAS. We have identified endogenous 
CD8+ T-cell reactivity against mutant KRAS in only one other patient with metastatic colon 
cancer (Patient 3995),20 and this patient did not have a response to cell therapy. However, in 
Patient 3995, only 0.002% of the infused cells targeted KRAS G12D, a possible reason for 
the absence of an antitumor response. The KRAS G12D–specific T-cell receptor that was 
isolated from Patient 3995 was also restricted by HLA-C*08:02 and, intriguingly, shared the 
identical T-cell receptor alpha-chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) 
sequence with two of the KRAS G12D–reactive T-cell receptors that were identified from 
Patient 4095 (Table S2 and Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). The sharing of

 identical T-cell–receptor chains between individuals is thought to be an extremely rare event 
but can occur in so-called public T-cell responses, which can dominate a response to a given 
shared antigen, such as those derived from common viruses.22
The identification of HLA-C*08:02–restricted T-cell receptors that target KRAS G12D 
neoepitopes provides an opportunity to develop T-cell–receptor gene therapy directed 
against a common driver mutation found in multiple cancer types. Such therapy has the 
advantage of targeting a molecule that is biologically important for tumor progression and 
that is likely to be clonally expressed in the tumor while not being expressed in normal 
tissues. In the United States, the HLA-C*08:02 allele is expressed in approximately 8% of 
whites and 11% of blacks, whereas the KRAS G12D mutation is most frequently found in 
pancreatic cancers (approximately 45%) and colorectal cancers (approximately 13%). Thus, 
the high incidence of KRAS G12D expression in these and other cancers means that in the 
United States alone, thousands of patients per year would potentially be eligible for T-cell–
based immunotherapy targeting KRAS G12D. HLA-A*11:01–restricted KRAS G12D and 
KRAS G12V–reactive T-cell receptors have been isolated from immunized HLA-A*11:01 
transgenic mice,23 although these receptors have not yet been evaluated in clinical trials.
In Patient 4095, we found direct evidence of tumor immune evasion in one lesion through 
loss of heterozygosity of the copy of chromosome 6 that encoded HLA-C*08:02 (Fig. 3, and 
Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The presence of this molecule is required for direct 
tumor recognition by the transferred KRAS G12D–specific T cells. Loss of heterozygosity 
at the HLA locus has been observed in human cancers and may represent a hurdle that needs 
to be overcome to enhance immunotherapeutic efficacy in some patients.24 In such cases, 
targeting antigens that are presented by the remaining HLA class I alleles or exploiting the 
CD4+ T-cell response or the innate immune system against cancer may be necessary to 
induce a durable clinical response.

coculture with two KRAS G12D–positive pancreatic-cancer cell lines not expressing the 
HLA-C*08:02 allele (mock) or expressing the HLA-C*08:02 allele with the use of enzyme-
linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. MDA 
denotes MDA Panc48 cell line, and HP HPAC cell line. Flow cytometry data are gated on 
CD8+ KRAS G12D–reactive cells. Values of more than 500 on the ELISPOT assay were not 
considered to be accurate.

 Figure 3. Analysis of the Frequency of HLA-C Alleles in Tumor Samples
Shown is the frequency of the two HLA-C alleles in a representative metastatic lesion 
resected from Patient 4095 before cell therapy (Tu-1) and in the progressing lesion (Tu-Pro). 
The Tu-1 and Tu-Pro samples were estimated to contain 53% and 34% tumor, respectively, 
and thus contained some normal cells that also contributed to the calculation of the HLA-C 
allele frequency. As shown, the progressing lesion harbored cells with a genetic loss of the 
HLA-C*08:02 allele, which provided a direct mechanism of immune evasion by the tumor, 
since the infused KRAS G12D–reactive T cells require this molecule for direct tumor 
recognition. The I bars represent standard errors. The P value for the comparison of the 
allele frequency of a metastatic lesion before therapy and the progressing lesion after 
therapy was calculated with the use of the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test.
