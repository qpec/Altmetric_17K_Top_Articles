Suicides Among American Indian/Alaska Natives — National Violent Death 
Reporting System, 18 States, 2003–2014

Suicide disproportionately affects American Indians/Alaska 
Natives (AI/AN). The suicide rate among AI/AN has been 
increasing since 2003 (1), and in 2015, AI/AN suicide rates in the 
18 states participating in the National Violent Death Reporting 
System (NVDRS) were 21.5 per 100,000, more than 3.5 times 
higher than those among racial/ethnic groups with the lowest 
rates.* To study completed suicides across all ages of AI/AN, 
NVDRS data collected from 2003 to 2014 were analyzed by 
comparing differences in suicide characteristics and circumstances 
between AI/AN and white decedents. Group differences were 
assessed using chi-squared tests and logistic regression. Across 
multiple demographics, incident characteristics, and circum-
stances, AI/AN decedents were significantly different from white 
decedents. More than one third (35.7%) of AI/AN decedents 
were aged 10–24 years (versus 11.1% of whites). Compared with 
whites, AI/AN decedents had 6.6 times the odds of living in a 
nonmetropolitan area, 2.1 times the odds of a positive alcohol 
toxicology result, and 2.4 times the odds of a suicide of a friend 
or family member affecting their death. Suicide prevention efforts 
should incorporate evidence-based, culturally relevant strategies at 
individual, interpersonal, and community levels (2) and need to 
account for the heterogeneity among AI/AN communities (3,4).
CDC’s NVDRS is an active state-based surveillance system that 
monitors the occurrence and characteristics of violent deaths, includ-
ing suicides. NVDRS links three data sources (death certificates, 
coroner/medical examiner reports, and law enforcement reports) to 
create a comprehensive picture of who dies from violence, where and 
when victims are injured, and what factors contributed to the vic-
tim’s death. This report includes all available 2003–2014 NVDRS

data from the 18 participating states.† Analyses were limited to 
suicide decedents aged ≥10 years. Non-Hispanic AI/AN are 
defined in NVDRS as persons with ancestries of the original 
inhabitants of North America who maintain their cultural 
† In 2003, the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) began data 
collection with six states (Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South 
Carolina, and Virginia) participating; seven states (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, North 
Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) joined in 2004, three (Kentucky, 
New Mexico, and Utah) in 2005, and two (Michigan and Ohio) in 2010. Ohio 
collected statewide data starting in 2011 and Michigan starting in 2014. CDC provides 
funding for state participation, and the ultimate goal is for NVDRS to expand to 
include all 50 states, U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia.

identification.§,¶ Non-Hispanic whites (whites) were used 
as a comparison group because they have the second-highest 
suicide rate, but concentrated among different age groups 
than AI/AN, allowing for comparisons that might reveal 
unique contributors to suicide above general risk factors. 
Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes were used to classify 
geographic areas into metropolitan and nonmetropolitan 
categories.** Demographics, incident characteristics, and 
precipitating circumstances were examined by race/ethnic-
ity using chi-squared tests. Significant chi-squared results 
(p<0.05) were further examined using logistic regression, 
controlling for age and sex.
From 2003 to 2014, a total of 1,531 suicides among AI/
AN and 103,986 among whites were collected in NVDRS 
(Table 1). More than one third (35.7%) of AI/AN suicides

** ZIP Code Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes (2010) were used 
to determine whether decedents resided in nonmetropolitan versus 
metropolitan areas. RUCA codes measure daily commuting flows, population 
density, and urbanization levels to classify sub-county level geographic areas. 
Victim residential ZIP codes were dichotomized as “metro” (RUCA codes 
1–3) and “nonmetro” (RUCA codes 4–10). Descriptions of the RUCA 
classification codes 1–10 are available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-

occurred among youths aged 10–24 years (9.8% aged 
10–17 years, 25.9% aged 18–24 years). In contrast, 11.1% 
of suicides among whites were in persons aged 10–24 years 
(2.5% aged 10–17 years, 8.6% aged 18–24 years). More 
than two thirds (69.4%) of AI/AN decedents resided in non-
metropolitan areas, whereas the majority of white decedents 
(72.7%) resided in metropolitan areas (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR] = 6.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.9–7.3). The 
largest proportion of both AI/AN and white decedents died 
by firearm (42.1% and 52.9%, respectively), with hanging/
strangulation/suffocation being the next largest proportion 
(39.7% and 22.5%, respectively).
Circumstance information, obtained primarily through 
information provided by persons who knew the decedent as 
indicated in coroner/medical examiner reports and law enforce-
ment reports, was known for 87.5% of AI/AN and 89.8% of 
white suicides (Table 2). Although intimate partner problems 
were a common precipitating circumstance for both AI/AN 
(39.1%) and white decedents (29.4%), AI/AN had significantly 
higher odds of experiencing this circumstance (aOR = 1.2; 95% 
CI = 1.1–1.3). Approximately two in 10 AI/AN suicides were 
preceded by an argument, compared with one in 10 white 
suicides (aOR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2–1.7). Compared with 
white decedents, AI/AN decedents had 2.4 times the odds of 
the suicide of a friend or family member affecting their death 
(as ascertained through a note or interviews with persons who 
knew the decedent) (95% CI = 1.9–3.1) and 1.7 times the odds

of the nonsuicide death of a friend or family member affecting 
their death (95% CI = 1.4–2.1).
Current diagnosed mental health problems (aOR = 0.4; 95% 
CI = 0.4–0.5), depressed mood (aOR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.8–1.0), 
and current mental health treatment (aOR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4–
0.5) were less likely to be reported among AI/AN decedents than 
among white decedents (Table 2). Substance abuse problems 
other than alcohol were not significantly different between 
AI/AN and white decedents; however, AI/AN decedents had 
1.8 times the odds of a reported alcohol problem compared 
with white decedents (95% CI = 1.6–2.1). In addition, AI/AN 
decedents were more likely to have reportedly used alcohol in 
the hours before death (aOR = 2.7; 95% CI = 2.4-3.0) and 
had more than twice the odds of a positive alcohol toxicology 
result (aOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.9–2.5) (Table 3). Among those 
tested, AI/AN decedents were significantly more likely to test 
positive for marijuana (aOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.2–1.8) and 
amphetamines (aOR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1–1.9), and signifi-
cantly less likely to test positive for antidepressants (aOR = 0.7; 
95% CI = 0.5–0.9) and opioids (aOR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4–0.7) 
than were white decedents (Table 3).
Discussion
Suicide rates among AI/AN are historically higher than those 
of the total U.S. population (1). The results of this study are 
consistent with previous research on risk factors for AI/AN 
suicidal behaviors (3,5) and provide additional information 
on important circumstances and characteristics that precede 
suicide among AI/AN. Across many demographics, incident 
characteristics, and circumstances, AI/AN decedents were 
significantly different from whites.
Approximately 70% of AI/AN decedents resided in non-
metropolitan areas, including rural settings, underscoring the 
importance of implementing suicide prevention strategies in 
rural AI/AN communities. Residential status can affect the 
circumstances surrounding suicide. For example, in this study 
AI/AN decedents had lower odds than did white decedents 
of having received a mental health diagnosis or mental health 
treatment, even when controlling for age and sex. Rural areas 
often have lower availability and use of mental health services 
because of provider shortages†† and social barriers, including 
stigma and lack of culturally competent care (6). To address 
provider shortages, financial incentives, such as loan forgive-
ness for mental health practitioners, represent one strategy that 
could be helpful in recruiting providers for rural and nonmet-
ropolitan areas (2). The high rate of suicides among AI/AN 
youths highlights the need for early prevention. School-based

programs are able to reach a large number of AI/AN youths 
at high risk and could increase the availability of services for 
AI/AN in isolated nonmetropolitan areas (4). In addition, 
school-based programs that focus on individual life skills devel-
opment and interpersonal social emotional learning programs 
to promote healthy relationships and conflict resolution might 
address the higher occurrence of intimate partner problems 
and arguments preceding AI/AN suicides (2,4).
AI/AN decedents were more likely to have a friend’s or family 
member’s suicide contribute to their death. A previous study in 
one AI/AN tribe found that suicidal behavior occurred close 
in time and within tight social networks, suggesting suicide

contagion (5). Given the observation that AI/AN had an 
elevated risk of their own suicide being linked to the suicide 
death of a loved one, community level prevention strategies, 
including programs that focus on postvention (e.g., survivor 
support groups) and safe reporting of suicides by the media 
(e.g., not using sensationalized headlines), should be considered 
(http://reportingonsuicide.org/wp-content/themes/ros2015/
assets/images/Recommendations-eng.pdf) (2).
Substance use is a recognized risk factor for suicidal behav-
ior (4). A larger proportion of AI/AN decedents used alcohol 
before their suicide and had reported alcohol abuse prob-
lems. Previous studies have found that AI/AN youths aged 
12–17 years have the highest rates of alcohol use among all 
racial/ethnic groups (4). Community-based programs to reduce 
excessive alcohol use (e.g., enforcement of laws prohibiting sales 
to minors and increasing alcohol taxes) and individual-level 
programs for persons at various risk levels, such as improved 
access to substance abuse treatment and life skills development 
programs for youths are necessary (1,4,7). Differences in the 
prevalence of alcohol use, interpersonal problems, and access 
to mental health treatment among AI/AN might be symptoms 
of disproportionate exposure to poverty, historical trauma, and 
other contexts of inequity and should not be viewed as inherent 
to AI/AN culture (4,8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, race of AI/AN decedents is often misclassified on 
death certificates resulting in underascertainment of AI/AN 
mortality, including suicide (9). Second, tribal affiliation is not 
collected in NVDRS. Thus, the heterogeneity of AI/AN tribes 
and the cultural differences between these communities could 
not be assessed, and results might not be generalizable across 
all AI/AN communities. Future studies are needed to identify 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have the highest rates of 
suicide of any racial/ethnic group in the United States. The rates 
of suicide in this population have been increasing since 2003.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of National Violent Death Reporting System data from 
18 states showed AI/AN suicide decedents were younger and 
had higher odds of living in a nonmetropolitan area than did 
non-Hispanic whites who died by suicide. Suicide and nonsui-
cide deaths of friends and family, as well as alcohol use 
preceding death were associated with AI/AN decedents more 
often than non-Hispanic white decedents.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The high prevalence of suicide among the AI/AN population 
and the comparative differences in suicide circumstances 
among AI/AN decedents illustrate some of the disparities this 
population faces. Focused, yet comprehensive, suicide preven-
tion and intervention efforts are needed that incorporate 
culturally relevant, evidence-based strategies at the individual, 
interpersonal, and community levels.
risk and protective factors for suicide that might be unique to 
individual tribes or communities. Third, it was not possible 
to determine whether decedents resided on tribal reservations 
based on the available information. Fourth, mental health 
diagnoses and treatment status are based on informant reports 
and could be underreported for either or both groups. Finally, 
NVDRS data were available from 18 states as of the time of 
this report and are therefore not necessarily representative of 
suicides outside these areas.
Prior research suggests comprehensive suicide prevention 
strategies designed to address the specific needs of an AI/AN

§ Adjusted odds ratios measure the association between the decedent having tested positive for the substance and the race of the decedent being AI/AN. The 
denominator was the number of decedents who were tested for each substance. Each adjusted odds ratio used white as the reference group and controlled for age 
group and sex.

community are associated with reductions in suicide (10). The 
high prevalence of suicide among AI/AN and the compara-
tive differences in suicide circumstances among this group are 
illustrative of the inequities faced by this population. This 
study highlights the importance of focused suicide prevention 
and intervention efforts that incorporate culturally relevant, 
evidence-based strategies at the individual, interpersonal, and 
community levels (2).
