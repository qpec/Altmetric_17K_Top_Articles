Introduction
Cosmetics, fragrances, and other personal 
care products are a possible source of human 
exposure to potentially endocrine-disrupting 
chemicals, such as phthalates, parabens, and 
phenols (Braun et al. 2014; Meeker et al. 
2013). Because women are the primary 
consumers of many personal care products, 
they are disproportionately exposed to these 
chemicals (CDC 2012). Adolescent girls may 
be at particular risk of exposure through this 
route. For example, one small study found 
that the average adult woman uses approxi-
mately 12 individual personal care products 
each day, whereas the average teenage girl uses 
17 (Environmental Working Group 2008).
Different types of phthalates, parabens, 
and phenols are used in a wide variety 
of consumer products. The three phthal-
ates most commonly used in personal care 
products are diethyl phthalate (DEP), which 
is found in scented products, including 
perfumes, deodorants, soaps, and shampoo; 
and di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and 
di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), which are used 
in nail polish and cosmetics (Dodson et al. 
2012; Guo and Kannan 2011). In vitro and 
animal studies have shown DEP, DnBP, and 
DiBP to have estrogenic and anti-androgenic 
properties (Alam et al. 2010; Harris et al. 
1997; Takeuchi et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 
2011), and human studies have found these 
phthalates to be associated with differences 
in behavior and allergic response in children 
(Braun et al. 2013). The parabens commonly 
used in personal care products include 
methyl, ethyl, butyl, and propyl paraben, 
which are used as preservatives and antibacte-
rial agents in cosmetics (Soni et al. 2005). 
Parabens have demonstrated weak estrogenic 
and anti-androgenic activity in in vitro and 
rat studies (Chen et al. 2007; Routledge 
et al. 1998; Vo et al. 2010), although little is 
known about their health effects in humans. 
Two phenols are also commonly used in 
personal care products. Triclosan, an anti-
microbial compound used in liquid soaps, 
acne cream, deodorants, shaving cream, and 
certain toothpastes, has been associated with 
alterations in thyroid hormone homeostasis 
in animal studies (Paul et al. 2010; Stoker 
et al. 2010). Benzophenone-3 (BP-3), also 
known as oxybenzone, is used in sunscreens, 
lip balm, and other sun protection products 
and is suspected to act as a weak estrogen 
based on its association with increased uterine 
weight in rats studies and increased prolif-
eration of human breast cancer cells in vitro 
(Schlumpf et al. 2001).
Personal care product use is widespread, 
and human exposure to these chemicals is 
nearly ubiquitous, with mono-ester phthalate 
metabolites of DEP, DnBP, and DiBP 
detected in the urine of > 96% of Americans 
participating in the 2009–2010 National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) (Zota et al. 2014). Methyl and 
propyl parabens were found in > 90% of 
individuals, BP-3 in 97%, and triclosan in 
75% (Calafat et al. 2008a, 2008b, 2010).
Awareness of endocrine disruptors in 
personal care products is increasing, and 
some companies now advertise products 
that are “low chemical” or “phthalate- and 
paraben-free.” However, to our knowledge, 
no studies have examined whether changing 
to low-chemical personal care products can 
lower levels of these potential endocrine 
disruptors in the body. Our community-
based participatory research study was 
conducted by youth researchers in a primarily 
Mexican American low-income community 
in Northern California. The intervention 
aimed to determine whether adolescent girls’ 
urinary concentrations of metabolites of three 
phthalates (DEP, DnBP, and DiBP), four

Background: Personal care products are a source of exposure to potentially endocrine-disrupting 
chemicals such as phthalates, parabens, triclosan, and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) for adolescent girls.
Methods: We enrolled 100 Latina girls in a youth-led, community-based participatory research 
intervention study to determine whether using personal care products whose labels stated they 
did not contain these chemicals for 3 days could lower urinary concentrations. Pre- and post-
intervention urine samples were analyzed for phthalate metabolites, parabens, triclosan, and BP-3 
using high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.
results: Urinary concentrations of mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) decreased by 27.4% (95% CI: 
–39.3, –13.2) on average over the 3-day intervention; no significant changes were seen in urinary 
concentrations of mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) and mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP). Methyl 
and propyl paraben concentrations decreased by 43.9% (95% CI: –61.3, –18.8) and 45.4% 
(95% CI: –63.7, –17.9), respectively. Unexpectedly, concentrations of ethyl and butyl paraben 
concentrations increased, although concentrations were low overall and not detected in almost 
half the samples. Triclosan concentrations decreased by 35.7% (95% CI: –53.3, –11.6), and BP-3 
concentrations decreased by 36.0% (95% CI: –51.0, –16.4).
discussion: This study demonstrates that techniques available to consumers, such as choosing 
personal care products that are labeled to be free of phthalates, parabens, triclosan, and BP-3, can 
reduce personal exposure to possible endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Involving youth in the design 
and implementation of the study was key to recruitment, retention, compliance, and acceptability 
of the intervention.

parabens (methyl, ethyl, butyl, and propyl 
paraben), and two phenols (triclosan and 
BP-3) decreased after switching to alterna-
tive personal care products. These nine 
compounds were targeted because they are 
widely used in personal care products; we 
expected to see no change in other phthalates 
and phenols [e.g., di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
(DEHP), bisphenol A (BPA)] whose use is 
primarily in plastics and other non–personal 
care product consumer goods.
Methods
The Health and Environmental Research on 
Makeup of Salinas Adolescents (HERMOSA) 
Study was a youth empowerment intervention 
study examining strategies to reduce personal 
care product chemical exposure to adoles-
cent girls. HERMOSA means “beautiful” in 
Spanish, reflecting the study’s focus on Latina 
teens. The study was designed in collaboration 
with 15 local high school students (including 
3 of the authors: M.C., I.A.V., G.M.-A.) 
participating in the CHAMACOS (Center 
for the Health Assessment of Mothers and 
Children of Salinas) Youth Council (Madrigal 
et al. 2014); they were hired as youth 
researchers and were involved in all aspects of 
the study, including study design, question-
naire development, identifying low-chemical 
replacement products, recruiting participants, 
collecting data, and returning results to 
the community.
Participants were 100 adolescent girls living 
in Salinas, California, a small city in an agri-
cultural region of Northern California with a 
predominantly Latino population. Participants 
were recruited through social media, word of 
mouth, and personal networks of the youth 
researchers. Girls were eligible for the study 
if they were between 14 and 18 years old, 
spoke English or Spanish, and had lived in the 
United States for at least 1 year. Girls received 
$100 in incentive coupons for their participa-
tion plus free samples of replacement personal 
care products. All replacement products were 
selected and purchased by the study with no 
input from manufacturers or retailers. Data 
collection took place in June–July 2013. This 
study was approved by the Committee for the 
Protection of Human Subjects at UC Berkeley.
Intervention
Girls participating in the study were provided 
with low-chemical personal care products 
and asked to refrain from using their regular 
products for 3 days. Each girl was provided 
with small (2–4 oz) polyethylene containers of 
shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and mois-
turizing lotion; a bar of hand soap (for home); 
a container of liquid soap (to carry in her 
purse); and roll-on deodorant. Additionally, 
each girl was allowed to choose four items 
from among liquid or powder foundation, 
mascara, eyeliner, lipstick/lip gloss/lip balm, 
and sunscreen. Girls were encouraged to 
choose the beauty products they used most 
often to help them comply with the inter-
vention. Participants were asked to avoid 
using any personal care products or cosmetics 
other than those provided by the study; if a 
particular type of product was not provided, 
participants were asked to forego using that 
item during the intervention period. Girls 
who reported using Colgate Total toothpaste 
(the only brand used by participants that listed 
triclosan as an ingredient) were given alternate 
toothpaste; all others were allowed to use their 
regular toothpaste brand.
The replacement personal care products 
provided to participants were selected to 
be free of phthalates, parabens, triclosan, 
and BP-3. Products were not tested for 
the presence of these chemicals because we 
lacked the resources for laboratory testing 
and because we wanted to select products 
based on information available to consumers. 
Rather, we identified products whose ingre-
dient lists did not include triclosan, BP-3/
oxybenzone, or any parabens. Because 
phthalates are not listed on ingredient lists, 
we avoided any products containing parfum 
or fragrance unless they were specifically 
labeled as “phthalate-free.” We identified a 
selection of eligible soaps, shampoos, lotions, 
sunscreens, and cosmetics through on-line 
searches, consumer databases [e.g., the Skin 
Deep® Cosmetics Database (Environmental 
Working Group 2016)], and in-store research, 
with priority given to products that were lower 
cost and available at local retail stores. The 
final products for use in the intervention were 
selected by the youth researchers, who tried all 
the products to help identify those most likely 
to appeal to adolescents based on marketing, 
scent, and effectiveness.
Data Collection
Participants were interviewed three times: 
during a home visit, and at pre- and post-
intervention office visits. All interviews were 
conducted by the youth researchers. The first 
visit was the home visit, during which we 
obtained informed assent (ages 14–17 years) 
or consent (age 18 years) from the partici-
pant as well as informed permission from her 
parent or guardian. We collected information 
about family income, household habits, and 
the family’s usual personal care and cleaning 
products from the parent/guardian using a 
brief survey. Additionally, at the home visit, 
we gave the participant four bins labeled 
“hair products,” “face products,” “body 
products,” and “teeth products” and asked 
her to place all the personal care products 
that she regularly used in the appropriate bin. 
We took photographs of each bin to ascertain 
brand names.
The pre- and postintervention visits 
occurred between 0800 and 1600 hours at 
the HERMOSA research office approximately 
1 week after the home visit. At the prein-
tervention visit, we measured participants’ 
height using a wall-mounted  
stadiometer 
and measured their weight and percent 
body fat using a Tanita bio-impedance scale. 
Participants then completed a computer-
assisted, interviewer-administered question-
naire including basic demographic questions 
and detailed questions about personal care 
product use in the previous 48 hr. The partici-
pant was shown the photographs we had taken 
at the home visit and was asked to indicate 
which products she had used in the previous 
48 hr and when. She was also asked if there 
were products she had used that were not in 
the pictures. She was then reminded not to 
use any of her usual personal care products 
during the intervention period. Participants 
provided an in-office urine sample in a sterile 
polypropylene cup. No wipes or external 
cleaning products were used before collec-
tion of the urine sample. At the conclusion 
of the visit, participants visited the study’s 
“Beauty Bar” where they selected replace-
ment personal care products, learned about 
the chemicals in makeup and personal care 
products, and received additional instructions 
about avoiding all personal care products 
except those provided by the study for the 
next 3 days.
The postintervention visit was sched-
uled 3 days later at the same hour as the 
pre 
intervention visit, to minimize the influ-
ence of diurnal variability on differences in 
analyte concentrations before and after the 
intervention. The participants provided 
a follow-up, in-office urine sample and 
completed a brief questionnaire about their 
knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related 
to personal care product chemicals and their 
compliance with the intervention. They also 
answered open-ended questions about their 
experience with the intervention study.
All urine samples were aliquoted and 
frozen at –80°C until shipment on dry ice to 
the Environmental Health Laboratory of the 
California Department of Public Health in 
Richmond, California for analysis.
Laboratory Methods
Phthalate laboratory methods were adapted 
from Kato et al. (2005). Ten phthalate urinary 
mono-ester metabolites were measured {MEP 
(monoethyl phthalate), MnBP (mono-
n-butyl phthalate), MiBP (monoisobutyl 
phthalate), MBzP (monobenzyl phthalate), 
MCHP (monocyclohexyl phthalate), 
MEHP [mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate], 
MEHHP [mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) 
phthalate], MECPP [mono(2-ethyl-
5-carboxypentyl) phthalate], MEOHP

[mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate], MCPP 
[mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate]}, although 
only MEP, MnBP, and MiBP (metabolites of 
DEP, DnBP, and DiBP, respectively) were 
the focus of this study. Urine samples were 
spiked with a mixture of stable isotope-labeled 
internal standards (Cambridge Isotopes) and 
enzymatically digested with glucuronidase at 
37°C for 90 min. Five hundred microliters of 
digested sample solution were injected into an 
on-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) column 
and analyzed using a high-performance liquid 
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometer 
(HPLC-MS/MS) system (API 5000; AB 
Sciex). Target analytes were chromatographi-
cally separated on a Betasil™ phenyl column 
in a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile 
and 0.1% acetic acid in gradient elution mode 
(Kato et al. 2005). Ionization of analytes was 
carried out with an electrospray ionization 
(ESI) source operating in negative mode. To 
enhance sensitivity, the mass spectrometer 
data were acquired using multi-period mode 
during chromatographic elution time.
The analytical method used to measure 
environmental phenols in urine has been 
previously described (Gavin et al. 2014). 
This method measures four parabens (methyl 
paraben, ethyl paraben, propyl paraben, and 
butyl paraben), BP-3, triclosan, and BPA. 
Urine samples were spiked with stable 
isotope-labeled internal standards and enzy-
matically de-conjugated overnight at 37°C. 
The digested samples were then processed by 
SPE using C18 cartridges, and the eluents 
were evaporated and reconstituted with 
mobile phase immediately before the analysis 
using a reverse-phase HPLC-MS/MS system 
(API 5500 QTRAP; AB Sciex). Ionization of 
the analytes was carried out by atmospheric 
pressure chemical ionization (APCI).
The r2 of calibration curves for all target 
analytes for both methods were ≥ 0.99. The 
limits of detection (LOD) for phthalates 
were similar to or slightly higher than those 
used in the NHANES analysis of the general 
U.S. population (LODs: MEP = 0.5 μg/L, 
MnBP = 0.9 μg/L, MiBP = 0.4 μg/L) but 
were sufficiently low to detect analytes in 
> 97% of the study population. The LODs 
for phenols were generally lower than those 
used in NHANES (LODs: methyl and 
ethyl paraben = 0.5 μg/L, butyl and propyl 
paraben = 0.2 μg/L, triclosan = 0.2 μg/L, 
BP-3 = 0.5 μg/L). Randomly selected samples 
(n = 8 for the phenol panel and n = 11 for the 
phthalate panel) were analyzed in duplicate, 
and the relative percent differences (RPD) 
between duplicate results for all analytes 
ranged from 0 to 19.6% for samples > LOD. 
Quality control samples were included in 
every analytical run, and the recoveries were 
all within 30% of the respective target values. 
Precision for each quality control level was 
good, with coefficients of variation (CV) 
for all analytes ≤ 15%. Field quality control 
included collection of 20 field blanks using 
highly purified water treated as urine samples, 
including contact with all field collection 
materials (e.g., urine cups, aliquotting mate-
rials, vials). All target analytes in the field 
blanks were below the respective LODs.
Chemical analyte concentrations were 
reported in ng/mL of urine. Concentrations 
below the limit of detection were assigned the 
value of LOD divided by the square root of 2 
(Hornung and Reed 1990).
To account for urinary dilution, urine 
specific gravity was measured in the field 
using a handheld refractometer (PAL-10S; 
Atago USA Inc.). Because NHANES does 
not report specific gravity–corrected concen-
trations, we also measured creatinine in the 
laboratory to facilitate comparison with 
NHANES. Creatinine was measured using 
applications of a colorimetric method known 
as the Jaffe reaction, and based on a method 
commercially available (BioAssay Systems 
QuantiChrom Creatinine Assay Kit DICT-
500) but using end point reaction measure-
ments and absorbance value collections after 
45 min of incubation time at 490 nm.
Statistical Analysis
We examined distributions of all the urinary 
analytes and compared them with those of all 
females 14–18 years of age in the 2011–2012 
wave of NHANES (n = 108). NHANES 
data were downloaded from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention website 
(CDC 2014). All analytes were approximately 
log-normally distributed, so analyte concen-
trations were log10-transformed for analysis. 
Geometric mean (GM) concentrations of 
creatinine-corrected and uncorrected analytes 
were compared between HERMOSA and 
NHANES using t-tests. Values < LOD were 
replaced with LOD divided by the square 
root of 2 for comparison.
We examined changes in urinary 
concentrations by comparing pre- and post-
intervention GMs and detection frequen-
cies (DF) and used mixed-effects models to 
quantify average within-individual percent 
change in urinary concentrations before and 
after the intervention, controlling for time of 
urine collection. The primary analyses used 
specific gravity–corrected concentrations, 
calculated using the following formula: 
(analyte concentration × 0.024)/(sample 
specific gravity – 1) (Mahalingaiah et al. 2008). 
We also examined creatinine-corrected values 
and uncorrected analyte concentrations while 
controlling for specific gravity or creatinine. 
In sensitivity analyses, we ran separate mixed-
effects models that a) excluded participants 
on their menses (n = 17), in case this contami-
nated the urine samples, and b) excluded 
participants who were also youth research assis-
tants (n = 5), in case their involvement in the 
study resulted in different behaviors.
In exploratory analyses, we compared pre- 
and postintervention urinary concentrations 
of BP-3 among participants who had used 
sunscreen within 48 hr before the preinter-
vention visit, and triclosan among partici-
pants who had used Colgate Total toothpaste 
within the 48 hr before the preintervention 
visit. We hypothesized that sunscreen would 
be the primary source of BP-3 exposure and 
Colgate Total would be a significant source 
of triclosan exposure; thus, we expected to 
see larger decreases when we restricted the 
analyses to users of these products than in 
the study population as a whole. Because 
parabens and phthalates are found in a wider 
range of products, we did not conduct similar 
exploratory analyses for these analytes.
All analyses were conducted using Stata 
version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, 
TX). Statistical significance was considered 
at α = 0.05.
Results
Demographics
The characteristics of the 100 young women 
enrolled in the study are shown in Table 1. 
All were between the ages of 14 and 18 years 
and self-identified as Mexican or Mexican 
American. More than half (57%) of partici-
pants reported speaking mostly Spanish at 
home, and 19% were born in Mexico. Only 
a third (33%) of participants reported that at 
least one of their parents had completed a high 
school education, and 38% of participants 
lived in households with an annual income 
less than the U.S. federal poverty threshold 
for a family of four ($24,250) (Office of 
the Assistant Secretary for Planning and 
Evaluation 2015).
At the time of the preintervention inter-
view, 67% of participants were wearing 
makeup and 30% were wearing sunscreen. 
Half of the study participants (50%) reported 
using makeup at least 4 days per week, and 
65% reported wearing fragrance at least 
4 days per week. Skin moisturizer use was 
common, with 65% of participants reporting 
daily use and 84% using moisturizer at least 
four times per week.
Comparison with NHANES
Exposure to the phthalates, parabens, and 
phenols of interest was common, with > 90% 
of participants having detectable concentra-
tions of MEP, MnBP, MiBP, methyl paraben, 
propyl paraben, triclosan, or BP-3 in their 
urine at the preintervention visit (Table 2). 
In general, LODs tended to be higher in 
NHANES than in our study; in the case of 
triclosan, the differences were quite large

(NHANES LOD = 2.3 μg/L; HERMOSA 
LOD = 0.2 μg/L). Creatinine-corrected 
urinary concentrations of all analytes except 
triclosan were higher among HERMOSA 
participants than among 14- to 18-year-old 
girls in NHANES, as assessed by comparing 
either GMs or medians. Urinary concen-
trations of all three phthalate metabolites 
were slightly higher in HERMOSA than in 
NHANES, but these differences were statisti-
cally significant only for MnBP (GM = 15.9 
vs. 8.0 μg/g) and MiBP (GM = 8.5 vs. 
6.4 μg/g). GM urinary concentrations of 
methyl, ethyl, butyl, and propyl paraben were 
significantly higher in HERMOSA partici-
pants than in NHANES (43.4 vs. 11.0; 1.6 
vs. 0.9, 0.5 vs. 0.1; 12.7 vs. 1.4 μg/g, respec-
tively), although the comparisons of ethyl 
and butyl parabens may be unstable due to 
the small proportion of girls with detect-
able concentrations of ethyl paraben (55% 
in HERMOSA, 25% in NHANES) and 
butyl paraben (49% in HERMOSA, 8% 
in NHANES). GM concentrations of BP-3 
were considerably higher in HERMOSA 
participants (97.4 μg/g) than in NHANES 
adolescent girls (14.7 μg/g), although 
the HERMOSA samples were collected in 
June and July when sunscreen use is most 
common, whereas NHANES was conducted 
throughout the year. GM concentrations of 
triclosan were slightly lower in HERMOSA 
than in NHANES (5.3 vs. 8.0 μg/g) but these 
differences were not statistically significant. 
Results were similar when non–creatinine-
corrected concentrations in HERMOSA and 
NHANES were compared, except that the 
difference in triclosan concentrations became 
statistically significant, whereas the differences 
in MEP, MnBP, MiBP, and ethyl paraben 
were no longer statistically significant (data 
not shown). Concentrations of BPA and the 
phthalates that were not the primary focus of 
this analysis tended to be higher in NHANES 
girls than in HERMOSA girls (see Table S1).
Impact of Intervention on 
Chemical Exposure
Geometric mean urinary concentrations of 
phthalate metabolites, paraben, triclosan, 
and BP-3 all decreased over the course of 
the 3-day intervention (Table 3). From the 
mixed-effects models controlling for time 
of day, we observed an average decrease of 
27.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 
–39.3, –13.2] in MEP metabolite concentra-
tions (preintervention GM = 78.2 μg/L vs. 
postintervention GM = 56.4 μg/L; p < 0.001) 
and a nonsignificant 11.3% (95% CI: 
–22.2, 1.1) decrease in MnBP concentra-
tions (preintervention GM = 28.3 μg/L vs. 
postintervention GM = 25.1 μg/L; p = 0.07). 
There were no statistically significant changes 
in MiBP urinary concentrations. Metabolite 
levels decreased in 68%, 58%, and 55% of 
girls for MEP, MnBP, and MiBP, respectively 
(Table 3). Figure S1 illustrates the individual 
changes pre- and postintervention for each 
girl, showing that metabolite levels increased 
for some girls. The proportion of girls with 
phthalate concentrations < LOD did not 
change significantly pre- and postinterven-
tion, with all three phthalates detected in 
almost all girls’ urine at both time points.
Methyl and propyl paraben, the most 
commonly detected parabens, decreased by 
43.9% (95% CI: –61.3, –18.8) and 45.4% 
(95% CI: –63.7, –17.9) on average, respec-
tively (Table 3). The GM of methyl paraben 
decreased from 77.4 μg/L to 43.2 μg/L. The 
proportion of girls with detectable concentra-
tions of methyl paraben decreased nonsig-
nificantly from 93% to 87%, and decreases 
in concentrations were observed in 61% of 
girls. The GM of propyl paraben decreased 
from 22.6 μg/L to 12.3 μg/L, with decreases 
observed in 63% of girls; the propor-
tion of girls with detectable concentrations 
of propyl parabens also decreased between 
pre- and postintervention (90% vs 87%), 
but not significantly. Unexpectedly, ethyl 
and butyl paraben concentrations both 
increased over the course of the interven-
tion period, with butyl paraben increasing 
by 101.7% (95% CI: 35.5, 203.2) and 
ethyl paraben increasing by a nonsignificant 
47.3% (95% CI: –0.7, 118.4), on average. 
However, the absolute changes in concen-
trations were small for both butyl paraben 
(pre 
intervention GM = 0.8 μg/L vs. post-
intervention GM = 1.7 μg/L) and ethyl 
paraben (pre 
intervention GM = 2.9 μg/L vs. 
postintervention GM = 4.2 μg/L), and these 
findings should be interpreted with caution 
because these analytes were detected only in 
about half of participants. Although detection 
frequencies increased postintervention, the 
differences were not statistically significant. 
Individual patterns in changes in paraben 
concentrations are shown in Figure S1.
Triclosan concentrations decreased by 
35.7% (95% CI: –53.3, –11.6) over the 3-day 
intervention (preintervention GM = 9.5 μg/L 
vs. postintervention GM = 6.1 μg/L) (Table 3). 
The decrease was larger when we restricted 
our analysis to the 32 girls who reported using 
triclosan-containing toothpaste at the prein-
tervention visit; among these girls, triclosan 
concentrations decreased by 70% (preinter-
vention GM = 36.4 μg/L vs. post 
intervention 
GM = 11.0 μg/L) (data not shown). Overall, 
triclosan concentrations decreased in 65% of 
girls. BP-3 concentrations decreased by 36.0% 
(95% CI: –51.0, –16.4) from a preinterven-
tion GM of 173.8 μg/L to a postinterven-
tion GM of 113.4 μg/L. When we restricted 
the analysis to the 30 girls who reported 
using sunscreen at the preintervention visit, 
BP-3 concentrations decreased by 52% 
(pre 
intervention GM = 434.4 μg/L vs. postint-
ervention GM = 203.0 μg/L). BP-3 concentra-
tions decreased in 65% of girls, overall. No 
significant differences were seen in the propor-
tion of participants with detectable levels of 
triclosan or BP-3 pre- and postintervention. 
Changes in analyte concentrations for each 
individual are shown in Figure S1.

vention analyte concentrations were similar

gravity–corrected values, and the decrease in 
MnBP became statistically significant (see 
Table S2). Results did not change substan-
tially when creatinine or specific gravity was 
included as a covariate in the mixed-effects 
model rather than using creatinine- or specific 
gravity–corrected values or when girls on their 
menses or girls employed as youth research 
assistants were excluded (data not shown).
Urinary concentrations of other measured 
analytes that are not primarily found in 
personal care products, such as the phthalate 
metabolites MBzP, MCHP, MEHP, 
MEHHP, MECPP, MEOHP, and MCPP 
and BPA, did not change during the course of 
the intervention (see Table S3).
Participant Compliance
Compliance with the intervention varied 
for different product types (Table 4). At the 
postintervention visit, > 90% of participants 
reported that they used only the  
low- 
chemical 
replacement hair, makeup, and body products 
they were given. However, 35% of partici-
pants stated that, at least once during the 
3 day intervention, they had washed with 
soaps other than the replacement soaps 
provided by the study. The main reasons for 
noncompliance were forgetting (32%), being 
away from home (12%), and using their 
regular product in cases when they did not 
choose a replacement among the additional 
four products allowed (21%).
Changes in Knowledge, Attitudes, 
and Behaviors
Most girls stated that they had learned 
something new about chemicals in cosmetics 
because of the study (66%) and that they 
would buy products without phthalates, 
parabens, triclosan, or BP-3/oxybenzone 
(71%) (Table 4). At the postintervention 
visit, 23% of girls reported that they had 
checked the ingredients of their regular 
products for these chemicals. Participants 
seemed to enjoy being in the study. Several 
girls stated that they appreciated learning 
about chemical exposures in personal care 
products and being taught methods for 
reducing their exposure (Appendix 1).
Discussion
The adolescent girls in this study expe-
rienced an average within-girl decline 
of 27–45% in urinary concentrations 
of certain phthalates, certain parabens,

 Reducing exposure from personal care products

triclosan, and oxybenzone after 3 days of 
abstaining from conventional personal care 
products and using replacement products 
with labels indicating they did not contain 
these chemicals.
Of the classes of chemicals studied, we 
found that phthalate concentrations decreased 
the least, with a 27% average decrease in 
MEP, an 11% nonsignificant average decrease 
in MnBP, and no change in MiBP. The rela-
tively modest change in these compounds over 
the intervention period may be attributable 
to the presence of these phthalates in other 
scented products in the home that were not 
replaced during the intervention, including 
air fresheners, fabric softeners, and cleaning 
products (Buckley et al. 2012; Cacho et al. 
2015; Viñas et al. 2015) as well as ingestion 
of phthalates in food (Colacino et al. 2010) 
and medications (Hernández-Díaz et al. 
2013; Kelley et al. 2012). It is estimated that 
the majority of an adult woman’s cumula-
tive exposure to DEP is through personal care 
product use, but that her cumulative exposure 
to DnBP and DiBP may also reflect signifi-
cant uptake from food and house dust (Guo 
and Kannan 2013). This is consistent with our 
finding of a significant decrease in MEP but 
not the other two metabolites. Additionally, 
MnBP is slower to clear from the body after 
exposure than MEP (Janjua et al. 2008a), so 
it is possible that 3 days was not long enough 
to detect statistically significant changes in 
MnBP concentrations. Finally, there are indi-
cations that DEP and DnBP use in personal 
care products is decreasing, presumably due 
to consumer advocacy (Campaign for Safe 
Cosmetics 2011). Several cosmetics companies 
have pledged to remove phthalates from their 
products (Kessler 2015), and urinary concen-
trations of MEP and MnBP have decreased 
substantially in the general U.S. population 
since 2004 (Zota et al. 2014), suggesting that 
the contribution of personal care products to 
Americans’ overall phthalate exposure may 
be declining.
The compounds that declined the most 
during the intervention were methyl and 
propyl paraben, which decreased by 44–45% 
on average over the course of our study. 
Parabens can be found in a wide variety of 
personal care products including cosmetics, 
lotions, soaps, and shampoos (Guo and 
Kannan 2013). Although several parabens 
are also used as preservatives in baked goods 
and processed food (Soni et al. 2005), levels 
are lower than in personal care products, and 
diet is not considered to be a major source of 
exposure (Liao et al. 2013). Dermal absorp-
tion from personal care products is likely the 
primary route of exposure (Guo and Kannan 
2013; Liao et al. 2013), which is consis-
tent with the reductions in urinary paraben 
concentrations seen in this study.
Contrary to expectations, we observed 
increases in urinary concentrations of ethyl 
and butyl parabens during the interven-
tion, although the absolute levels of these 
compounds remained low. The ingredient 
lists of all the replacement beauty products 
indicated that they were paraben-free, though 
it is possible that some of these products 
contained ethyl and butyl paraben either as an 
unintentional contaminant or as an unlabeled 
substitute for methyl and/or propyl paraben. A 
limitation of our study is that we were not able 
to test the replacement products to ensure that 
they did not contain the chemicals of concern, 
so we were unable to identify the sources of the 
increased ethyl and butyl paraben exposure.
We also observed average decreases of 36% 
in triclosan and BP-3 concentrations. Triclosan 
exposure is thought to occur by ingestion 
among users of triclosan-containing toothpaste 
and by dermal absorption among users of 
antibacterial soaps, skin cleansers, and other 
triclosan-containing personal care products 
(CDC 2013b). We found that the decrease 
in triclosan concentrations was largest among 
girls who had been using toothpaste containing 
triclosan but changed brands during the study, 
suggesting that toothpaste may be a signifi-
cant source of triclosan exposure. BP-3 is an 
ultraviolet-protection agent found mainly in 
sunscreens and cosmetics offering sun protec-
tion (CDC 2013a), which is consistent with 
our finding of the largest decrease in BP-3 
levels among sunscreen users.
The phthalates, parabens, and phenols 
examined in this study are nonpersistent 
compounds with short half-lives that are 
cleared from the body within 24–48 hr 
following exposure (Gonzalez et al. 2006; 
Janjua et al. 2008a, 2008b; Sandborgh-
Englund et al. 2006), which allowed us to 
examine average differences in urinary concen-
trations after just 3 days. We measured the 
analytes in spot urine samples, which reflect 
very recent exposure, likely over the past 12 
to 24 hr. Collecting 24-hr urine samples 
from the participants in this study would 
have yielded a more comprehensive picture 
of exposure over that entire day, but would 
have imposed considerably more burden on 
the participants. By collecting the spot samples 
at the same time of day before and after the 
intervention, we minimized the influence 
of within-day variability while assessing the 
impact of the intervention on recent exposure.
Although urinary concentrations of 
MEP, methyl and propyl paraben, triclosan, 
and BP-3 decreased over the course of the 
intervention, they were not eliminated. Even 
after changing to low-chemical products, the 
majority of girls (> 90%) continued to have 
detectable concentrations of these compounds 
in their urine. One possibility is that not all 
of the preintervention exposure was cleared 
from the body during the intervention period; 
particularly for BP-3, there is evidence that 
low levels of the chemical may remain in the 
body for up to 5 days after dermal exposure 
(Gonzalez et al. 2006). Thus, it is possible 
that the 3-day intervention period was too 
short and that we might have observed larger 
decreases in urinary metabolite concentrations 
if the girls had used the replacement personal 
care products for a longer period of time. 
We selected the 3-day intervention period 
because we assumed it was long enough to 
detect changes in urinary metabolite levels 
but short enough to maximize participant 
compliance. It is also likely that other sources 
of exposure beyond personal care products 
exist, and/or that the replacement products 
were not completely free of these compounds. 
Although on average most analytes decreased, 
many participants experienced increases in 
some analyte levels over the course of the 
intervention. Upon receiving individual 
results, some of these girls were surprised 
that their levels had risen despite their best 
efforts to comply. Their experience highlights 
the difficulty of reducing exposure to these 
 
ubiquitous compounds.
HERMOSA Study participants, who were 
examined in 2013, had urinary concentrations 
of the chemicals of interest that were similar to 
or slightly higher than adolescent girls partici-
pating in NHANES in 2011 and 2012. It is 
unlikely that the differences in LODs between 
HERMOSA and NHANES accounted for 
much of the observed differences in urinary 
concentration between the two populations, 
because median as well as geometric mean 
levels tended to be higher in HERMOSA. 
The NHANES and HERMOSA samples were 
analyzed by different laboratories, which may 
affect comparability. However, the California 
Department of Public Health laboratory 
that analyzed the HERMOSA samples has 
participated in and passed the proficiency test 
program administrated by the CDC every 
year (two rounds per year) since 2012 to 
ensure that their results are comparable with 
those of NHANES. Additionally, although 
concentrations of parabens, MiBP, MnBP, 
and BP3 were higher in HERMOSA partici-
pants, concentrations of other phthalates 
and phenols not primarily found in personal 
care products were higher in NHANES girls, 
suggesting that the differences were attribut-
able to exposure patterns rather than system-
atic analytical differences between laboratories. 
We compared the HERMOSA urinary 
concentrations with those of all adolescent 
girls in NHANES, rather than Latina adoles-
cents, because of NHANES sample size limi-
tations. The HERMOSA Study participants 
were all Latina and mostly low-income and 
their personal care product use patterns may 
differ from than the general U.S. population, 
 Harley et al.
1606 
volume 124 | number 10 | October 2016 • Environmental Health Perspectives
which may affect the generalizability of 
our findings. The finding of higher analyte 
concentrations in our population are consis-
tent with studies in NHANES showing that 
levels of phthalates and parabens are higher 
among African Americans and Mexican 
Americans than whites (CDC 2012).
Overall, compliance was good in this 
study (> 90% for all products except hand 
soap), although most girls found it difficult to 
completely comply with the protocol, particu-
larly regarding use of hand soap. Presumably 
decreases in exposure would have been larger 
with perfect compliance. Most girls stated that 
they would like to use products without poten-
tially harmful chemicals. However, identifying 
these products often requires a considerable 
amount of effort and expense on the part of 
the consumer. In our experience, we had little 
trouble purchasing low-chemical hand soaps 
and shampoos even in mainstream retailers, 
but found that low-chemical makeup was 
hard to identify, not sold many places, and 
often expensive. Although many stores have 
dedicated displays for low-chemical personal 
care products, these still represent only a small 
portion of the personal care product market 
and, in our experience, can be particularly 
difficult to find in low-income communities. 
Future studies should look at the long-term 
effects of education about endocrine disruptors 
in personal care products on girls’ product 
choices, behavior changes, and exposure levels.
Finally, a major strength of this study was 
that it was rooted in the tenets of community-
based participatory research, including bidi-
rectional learning between the researchers 
and community youth. Involving the youth 
research assistants in the study design and 
implementation allowed us to create an 
intervention that was culturally appropriate, 
scientifically valid, and relevant and interesting 
to the adolescent participants. The 100% 
retention, good compliance, and detailed 
data collection were likely attributable to the 
connection that the youth research assistants 
were able to forge with the study participants.
In summary, this is the first study that 
we know of to show that techniques available 
to consumers, such as choosing personal care 
products that are labeled as free of phthal-
ates, parabens, triclosan, and oxybenzone, can 
significantly reduce personal exposure to these 
potentially endocrine-disrupting chemicals. 
Our study did not test for the presence of 
these chemicals, but simply used techniques 
available to the average consumer: reading 
labels and investigating product safety through 
web-based databases. Our findings suggest 
that consumers may be able to reduce expo-
sures by seeking out commercially available 
products with lower levels of these chemicals.

Appendix 1. Comments from HERMOSA Participants
What did you enjoy most about participating in the HERMOSA study?
• I enjoyed meeting the members of HERMOSA study and getting introduced to other 
products of makeup that can be healthier to your skin. 
• Realizing that the powder HERMOSA study provided me was not as heavy as the makeup 
brand I usually used and looked more natural.
• What I enjoyed the most was challenging myself to not use my products and just the 
products I was given.
• Trying more natural products and learning about the harsh chemicals found in the usual 
products I use.
• I enjoyed learning [about] low-chemical products. This was a good experience and a cool 
challenge most people should participate in to become informed on how their everyday 
products are affecting them. 
• I enjoy getting FREE makeup.
• I enjoyed feeling naturally beautiful.
How has the study been beneficial to you?
• The study has taught to make smarter choices by choosing healthier and low 
chemical products.
• I learned that you can look good and still keep track of what your products contain.
• It has been beneficial because I learned that there are harmful things in the products we 
use every day.
• The study [was] beneficial to me because now I know what products I can buy for 
better health.
• This study has been beneficial to me in that it made me aware that products we have at 
home serve the same function as other products that are found in the store.
• The study has been beneficial to me because now I’m more aware of the chemicals my 
makeup has.
• It actually made me want to buy these [low chemical] products on my own because I really 
liked them.
