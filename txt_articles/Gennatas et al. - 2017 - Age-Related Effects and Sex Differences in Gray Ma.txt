Introduction
Structural neuroimaging provides insights into the spectrum of
typical and nontypical brain and neurocognitive development.
T1-weighted imaging is the most commonly acquired MRI se-
quence and offers high-resolution, low-noise images of brain
structure with good tissue contrast. Several structural measures
can be derived from a single T1-weighted image, including gray
matter density (GMD), gray matter volume (GMV), and cortical
thickness (CT). Since the early days of MRI, a large body of re-
search has used these measures to study healthy and clinical pop-
ulations. Perhaps surprisingly, confusion exists in the field as
GMD, GMV, and CT are often wrongly assumed to be equivalent
or highly related measures of regional gray matter quantity. GMV

Significance Statement
This study demonstrates that different MRI-derived gray matter measures show distinct age and sex effects and should not be
considered equivalent but complementary. It is shown for the first time that gray matter density increases from childhood to
young adulthood, in contrast with gray matter volume and cortical thickness, and that females, who are known to have lower gray
mattervolumethanmales,havehigherdensitythroughoutthebrain.Acustompreprocessingpipelineandanovelhigh-resolution

A clear understanding of normal structural brain development is essential for the examination of brain–behavior relationships,
the study of brain disease, and, ultimately, clinical applications of neuroimaging.

 and CT are measured in cubic millimeters and millimeters, re-
spectively. GMD, on the other hand, is a unitless, scalar measure
derived from image segmentation and related to T1 signal inten-
sity. In one form or other, gray matter abnormalities have been
described in all major neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Voxel-
based morphometry (VBM) analyses have suggested syndrome-
specific regional atrophy patterns in neurodegenerative diseases
(Seeley et al., 2009). Gray matter abnormalities are widely re-
ported in psychiatric disorders as well but paint a more complex
picture (Brent et al., 2013; Bakhshi and Chance, 2015), likely
reflecting both increased neuropathological heterogeneity and
diagnostic variability. Much of psychopathology emerges around
adolescence, a period characterized by rapid changes in behavior.
Detecting and interpreting what may often be subtle and diffuse
disease-related differences on top of profound and variable age-
related changes is particularly challenging. A clear, multidimen-
sional understanding of normative structural brain development
is therefore essential.
The first 2 years of life are characterized by rapid gray matter
growth, which reaches its lifetime maximum at �2–3 years of age
(Matsuzawa et al., 2001; Knickmeyer et al., 2008). In contrast,
myelination of white matter tracts continues well into adulthood,
until the late 30s (Grydeland et al., 2013). Several developmental
neuroimaging studies have described modest decreases in gray
matter during adolescence using measures derived from gray
matter volume and cortical thickness (Sowell et al., 2003, 2004;
Gogtay et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2008; Brain Development Coop-
erative Group, 2012). It should be noted that some of the early
studies used the term “gray matter density” to refer to the pro-
portion of gray matter voxels around a sphere of fixed diameter
following hard segmentation of the brain (Sowell et al., 2003,
2004; Gogtay et al., 2004) and suggested that this quantity re-
flected local cortical thickness. Today, cortical thickness can be
measured directly using automated methods and GMD usually
refers to a different measure, specifically the output of soft seg-
mentation. Unlike hard segmentation, where each voxel is la-
beled as “gray,” “white,” or “CSF” (for the common three-class
case), soft segmentation creates a GMD map by assigning voxels a
value between 0 and 1, which is considered to reflect the amount
of gray matter in each voxel. It is related to the T1 signal and thus
to the regional proton density as well as the tissue microenviron-
ment. To complicate things further, one of the most common
measures used in the literature, and the default option in many
VBM pipelines, is “modulated” gray matter density. This is equal
to GMD multiplied by a scaling factor to account for volume
change from the individual’s native space image to the registra-
tion template. It adds to the confusion because the relative con-
tribution of each measure is unclear and likely variable spatially
and temporally (with regard to age). To date, no study has com-
pared age-related effects on these four commonly used gray mat-
ter measures.
In this study, we used the extensive cross-sectional neuroim-
aging dataset collected on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental
Cohort (PNC) to characterize age effects and sex differences on
native space gray matter density, volume, and mass (defined as
density � volume; equivalent to modulated gray matter density),
as well as cortical thickness.
Materials and Methods
Subjects and MRI acquisition. All data were collected as part of the PNC,
as previously described (Satterthwaite et al., 2014). Procedures were ap-
proved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. A total of 1189 subjects
(648 females) ranging in age from 8 to 23 years were selected from a
starting total of 1601 subjects after excluding those with a neurological or
psychiatric history, use of psychoactive medication, or incidental find-
ings and those whose structural data failed quality control. The scanning
of all subjects was performed on the same Siemens TIM Trio scanner at
the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. T1-weighted imaging was
obtained using a magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient
echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR � 1810 ms; TE � 3.51ms; FoV � 180 �
240 mm; Resolution � 0.94 � 0.94 � 1.0 mm).
MRI preprocessing. A custom T1 preprocessing pipeline was created using
Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs; https://github.com/stnava/ANTs;
RRID: SCR_004757). Raw T1 volumes were first corrected for bias due to
field inhomogeneity using the N4 algorithm (Tustison et al., 2010). The
bias-corrected volumes were then registered to a whole-head MNI tem-
plate (whole-head-to-whole-head registration). The inverse transforma-
tion was used to map the MNI brain mask to native space, which was used
to isolate the brain in native space (skull stripping). The skull-stripped
volume was then registered to the skull-stripped MNI template (brain-
to-brain registration), which results in improved registration accuracy
compared with the whole-head-to-whole-head registration (Klein et al.,
2010). Registrations were performed by a sequence of rigid, affine, and
symmetric diffeomorphic transformations (Avants et al., 2008; Klein et
al., 2009).
Gray matter density and cortical thickness estimation. MRI brain tissue
segmentation is commonly guided by a set of tissue priors. Given the
wide age range of our sample, we wanted to avoid using a single set of
priors for all subjects or different sets of priors for different age bins. We
therefore implemented an iterative process based on Atropos (Avants et
al., 2011) that requires no tissue priors. On the first iteration, K-means
initialization was used to derive three classes. The following two itera-
tions used the segmentation output of the previous step for initialization.
This procedure resulted in a three-class hard segmentation and a GMD
map (soft segmentation) for each subject in native space (Fig. 1A). Cor-
tical thickness was obtained using the diffeomorphic registration-based
cortical thickness estimation procedure of ANTs (DiReCT, Das et al.,
2009), following registration of all T1 images to a study-specific template.
This method offers reliable CT estimation (Tustison et al., 2014) and, by
providing a voxelwise measure in native volumetric space, allows the use
of the same brain parcellation as the other modalities.
Quality assurance. To assess the quality of the T1 acquisition and seg-
mentation, we calculated pairwise spatial correlations among all subjects
for two sets of images: bias-field corrected, normalized T1s, and normal-
ized GMD maps. All images whose spatial correlation was 2 SDs lower
than the mean in either case were excluded (n � 56). A visual check
confirmed the variable extent of motion artifacts in the excluded images,
with those near the threshold being only minimally affected (still ex-
cluded). The motion artifact is known to significantly affect tissue seg-
mentation and all our derived measures (Blumenthal et al., 2002; Savalia
et al., 2017), and our large sample afforded us this perhaps conservative
exclusion threshold.
High-resolution gray matter parcellation. Multiple methods for whole-
brain parcellation have been previously proposed. Anatomical parcella-
tions,liketheAAL(AutomatedAnalyticalLabeling)atlas(Tzourio-Mazoyer
et al., 2002) and the Harvard-Oxford Atlas (distributed with FSL;
https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/; RRID:SCR_002823) are based on neuroanat-
omy but consist of a small number of relatively large regions. Using large
parcels or regions of interest runs the risk of averaging over inhomoge-
neous regions, resulting in signal loss. On the other hand, a number of
approaches have been proposed for parcellation based on functional
connectivity derived from task-free functional MRI data (also known as
resting-state fMRI), but none were based on T1-weighted images. A re-
cent approach used multimodal MRI data to create a parcellation of 180
regions in each hemisphere. As the authors note, the parcels show high
variance in shape and size and consider their number to be “a lower
bound, as some parcels are probably complexes of multiple areas”
(Glasser et al., 2016).
Our goal was to develop a high-resolution parcellation derived from
structural data where parcels are centered around GMD peaks (i.e., cor-
tical gyri and subcortical nuclei). An age- and sex-matched subsample of
5066 • J. Neurosci., May 17, 2017 • 37(20):5065–5073
Gennatas et al. • Gray Matter Development in Adolescence
 the 1189 subjects was created by first splitting the initial sample by sex,
then splitting each set into deciles based on its age range, and finally
randomly selecting 12 subjects from each resulting subset (i.e., 12 sub-
jects per sex per age decile), giving a total of 240 subjects. A mean image
was created from the normalized, smoothed GMD maps of these sub-
jects. To identify GMD peaks, the gradient of the mean GMD image was
calculated, subtracted from 1, and smoothed. A 3D watershed algorithm
was applied on the resulting image, producing 1625 parcels covering the
whole-brain gray matter (Fig. 1B).
Native space parcelwise data extraction. The GMD1625 parcellation
was transformed into each subject’s native space by applying the inverse
of the brain-to-brain transformation (i.e., MNI-to-native space) and
masked by each subject’s gray matter hard segmentation. Volume and
mean GMD and CT values were estimated for each parcel for each subject
using the c3d utility (part of ITK-SNAP; http://www.itksnap.org/; RRID:
SCR_002010). CT values were measured for 1339 of the 1625 regions,
after excluding subcortical regions. To get a native space equivalent of
modulated density, we derived gray matter mass (GMM) as the product
of GMD and GMV. Native space analysis allows the direct measurement
of GMV and the extraction of mean GMD and CT values with no inter-
polation. Averaging GMD and CT values within each parcel instead of
applying Gaussian smoothing avoids smoothing-related artifacts, which
are exaggerated in a segmented image. Cortical thickness (and therefore
the gray matter segmentation) varies at �2–5 mm, while smoothing
kernels are commonly at least 8 mm full-width at half-maximum. In a
gray matter segmentation, this results in voxel intensities being averaged
with surrounding empty voxels (i.e., voxels of zero intensity), causing a
drop in signal. The extent of signal drop depends on the number of
surrounding empty voxels, which varies both by brain region and age.
This makes intensity values from different locations incomparable and
directly confounds age-related effects. Interpolation results in a similar
artifact, equivalent to smoothing at the single-voxel level.
Age-related effects and sex differences. Generalized additive models
(GAMs) were used to characterize age-related effects and sex differences on
GMD,GMV,GMM,andCTusingthemgcvpackage(Wood,2011,2012)in
R (R Project for Statistical Computing; https://www.r-project.org/; RRID:
SCR_001905). A GAM is similar to a generalized linear model where
predictors can be replaced by smooth func-
tions of themselves, offering efficient and flex-
ible estimation of nonlinear effects. Three sets
of models were fit. Full models included age
and age-by-sex interaction terms represented us-
ing penalized smoothing splines with smoothing
parameters selected by restricted maximum
likelihood. For each modality in turn, for each
gray matter parcel p, a model of form (1) was
fit.
{GMD, GMV, GMM, CT}p � Sex
� s(Age) � s(Age � Sex),
(1)
where s() represents a penalized smoothing
spline. The dimension of the basis used to rep-
resent the smooth terms was limited to a max-
imum of five in all models. Reduced models
were fit to obtain accurate p values for the main
effects of sex and age. Specifically, model 2
omits the interaction term and was fit for each
parcel to obtain p values for the main effect of
sex. Model 3 omits sex entirely and was there-
fore fit separately for each sex s to obtain p
values for the main effect of age.

Models of form 3 were also fitted at the whole-brain level, using mean
GMD and CT (weighted by the number of voxels in each parcel), and
total GMV and GMM, as separate dependent variables, as follows:
{MeanGMD, MeanCT, TotalGMV, TotalGMM}s,p � s(Age).

In each case, p values were corrected for multiple comparisons by con-
trolling the false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini and Hochberg method;
q value � 0.05).
Results
Whole-brain age-related effects: gray matter density increases
while volume and thickness decrease
We sought to characterize age-related effects and sex differences
at the whole-brain and regional level on three independent gray
matter measures, GMD, GMV, and CT, and a derived measure,
GMM � GMD � GMV. At the whole-brain level, we find that
total brain GMV and CT decrease from childhood to young
adulthood (8–23 years of age) in accordance with previous stud-
ies. In contrast, mean brain GMD increases during the same pe-
riod. Whole-brain GMM shows only a modest decrease. Figure 2
shows plots of fitted values converted to relative percentages (fit-
ted values for 8-year-old males are defined as 100%) derived from
whole-brain models (model of form 4 in Materials and Methods,
Age-related effects and sex differences). Importantly, GMD is
most sensitive to age, as follows: 30% and 40% of the variance of
mean brain GMD is explained by age at scan time for males and
females, respectively. CT follows with respective values of 30%
and 24%, while only 7% and 10% of the variance of total brain
GMV is explained by age for males and females, respectively.

 Whole-brain sex differences: females
have lower volume, higher density
than males
Females were found to have lower total
GMV than males, as expected by known
sex differences in average head and brain
size. At the same time, however, we show
that females have higher mean GMD than
males. Total CT was not significantly dif-
ferent between the two sexes in our anal-
ysis (Fig. 2).
Regional variability in age-related and
sex effects
To achieve regional specificity, we created
a high-resolution parcellation covering
the whole-brain gray matter and consist-
ing of 1625 regions. To summarize the
large number of regional results, each of
the 1625 gray matter parcels was assigned
one of nine MNI labels (frontal lobe, tem-
poral lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, insula, caudate, putamen,
thalamus, and cerebellum), as defined by the MNI atlas in FSL.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for each measure aggregated
by MNI label. GMM and GMV had the highest coefficient of
variation (CV; mean CV � 26.7 and 26.0, respectively), followed
by CT (mean CV � 15.6). GMD showed the lowest CV (mean
CV � 3.7).
Parcelwise GAMs were fitted to investigate the regional vari-
ability of age-related and sex effects in our sample (1625 parcels
for GMD, GMV, and GMM; 1339 parcels for CT). Table 2 shows
the percentage of parcels with a significant main effect of age, a
main effect of sex, and an age-by-sex interaction after FDR cor-
rection (q � 0.05), aggregated by MNI label. GMD showed sig-
nificant age effects throughout the brain (99% of parcels in males,
99.9% in females), followed by CT (89% males, 88% females).
GMV, on the other hand, showed significant age effects only in
52% and 65% of parcels in males and females respectively, while
the numbers for GMM were 41% and 33%. Sex effects were
strong for GMD, GMV, and GMM. Indeed, the main effect of sex
was more widespread than the main effect of age in GMV and
GMM. Sex effects in CT were present in a minority of regions
across the whole brain but were present in just over half of all
temporal and parietal parcels. Age-by-sex interactions were vir-
tually limited to GMD. Table 3 shows the unadjusted p value
corresponding to an FDR q value of 0.05 and the median of
unadjusted p values surviving FDR correction.
To study the direction of age-related effects in each parcel, the
net change from youngest to oldest was estimated by subtracting
the fitted value at 8 years of age from the fitted value at 23 years of
age for each modality, sex, and region and was converted to a
percentage (by dividing with the fitted values at 8 years). The net
change for parcels not surviving FDR correction was set to zero.
GMD increased, on average, within all MNI regions, while GMV
and CT decreased. Mean GMM decreased in all MNI regions
other than the temporal lobe, insula, and cerebellum. The bilat-
eral insula stands out, showing the highest increase in GMD and
GMM of all the MNI regions. To characterize the sensitivity to
age of each parcel, we examined the adjusted R 2 value of each
model, denoting the percentage of variance of the regional values
of each modality explained by age. Table 4 lists R 2 values and the
percentage change for each modality. Averaging by MNI label
masks the variability within each label; for example, a lobe may
on average decrease in volume, but some parcels within it may in-
crease. For this reason, Table 4 includes numbers of individual par-
celswithanetpositiveandanetnegativechangefrom8to23yearsof
age within each MNI label. Brain slices mapping the net change and

Figure 4 helps describe how development modulates sex ef-
fects by plotting the average difference of male and female fitted
values per modality per MNI region by age from 8 to 23 years of
age. Males and females have no differences in GMD at 8 years of
age, but females start to lead soon thereafter throughout the
brain. Males have higher GMV and GMM on average in each
MNI region throughout this age range. Only CT shows a change
in the direction of sex differences with age. Males have higher CT
values in bilateral insula until �12 years of age and in frontal and
occipital lobes until age 15 years of age, at which points the effect
reverses, leading to a female advantage. In most cases, the sex
differences have a nonlinear relationship with age.
GMM largely resembles GMV, not GMD
We defined GMM as the product of GMD and GMV to study a
native-space equivalent of modulated density, a very popular
measure in structural neuroimaging studies. GMM showed age-
related effects that, for the most part, closely paralleled those of
GMV (Fig. 5). This is probably because GMV has much higher
variance than GMD (Table 1) and consequently contributes
much more to the variance in GMM explained by age than GMD
does. Despite this, three MNI regions showed, on average, oppo-
site direction of net change in GMM than in GMV (i.e., an in-
crease instead of a decrease). This was observed in both males and
females, in descending order of magnitude, in the insula, the
temporal lobe, and the cerebellum (Table 4).
Development modulates intermodal relationships among
structural measures
To summarize the differences in age-related effects among the
four measures with a single quantity, we calculated pairwise cor-
relation coefficients of fitted values for our sample’s age range
(8–23 years old; Fig. 5, top row). Spearman correlation was used
as most fitted values are nonlinear. As expected from the results
above, GMD was negatively correlated with GMV and CT
throughout the brain and cortex respectively. GMM was posi-

Density increases in adolescence while other measures largely decrease. Females have higher density and lower
volume. Plots show fitted values of whole-brain gray matter measures against age for the two sexes. GMD and CT were averaged

 tively correlated with GMV and CT in all MNI regions, on aver-
age, with the exception of the insula. Looking at the same pairwise
correlations among the residuals (i.e., after removing the effect of
age), we see that most correlations are positive, with the notable
exception of the density and thickness pair in the insula (Fig. 5,
bottom row). Intermodal correlations of residuals help to suggest
what relationships may look like in the absence of an age effect
but are no substitute for directly examining separate age bins,
which should ideally extend across the life span.
Discussion
Despite extensive use of different MRI-derived gray matter mea-
sures in the literature, very few attempts have been made to di-
rectly compare them or their developmental patterns, and they
are often wrongly assumed to be equivalent. This study shows
distinct age-related effects and sex differences on whole-brain
and regional measures of GMD, GMV, GMM (GMM � GMD �
GMV), and CT in a cross-sectional dataset of 1189 youths rang-
ing in age from 8 to 23 years drawn from the PNC. A custom T1
preprocessing pipeline and a novel high-resolution gray matter
parcellation were created to produce unbiased gray matter seg-
mentations without use of priors and to extract native space mea-
sures without any interpolation or smoothing. Our findings
partly challenge the widely held, though vague, view that “gray
matter declines” from childhood to young adulthood and pro-
vide a more complete description of developmental gray matter
differences.
Not all gray matter declines in adolescence
Mean brain GMD increases from childhood to young adulthood,
while total brain GMV and mean CT decrease. Total GMM only
shows a slight decrease from 8 to 23 years of age, suggesting that
an increase in density may partly counter a decrease in volume.
Regionally, GMD increases virtually throughout the brain. GMV,
on the other hand, decreases on average in all lobes and subcor-
tical regions, but there are parcels within those broad regions
whose volume increases, particularly in frontotemporal cortex.

 Future work will determine whether areas
that expand during adolescence despite
an overall decline in volume support the
enhancement of specific neurocognitive
functions.
Age-related effects and sex differences
in density may help understand
cognitive abilities
We know that higher GMV correlates
with higher neurocognitive performance
in adults (Gur et al., 1999; McDaniel,
2005), which gives rise to the following
two apparent paradoxes: (1) adolescence
is characterized by a sharp rise in neuro-
cognitive performance (Gur and Gur,
2016), despite a decline in GMV; and (2)
there are no significant sex differences in
general intelligence (Halpern et al., 2007),
despite a male advantage in GMV. Our
results suggest that an age-associated vol-
ume decrease might be compensated for
by increasing gray matter density during
adolescence, and lower volume in females
might be compensated for by higher den-
sity throughout the brain.
Biological basis of structural MR
measures: the need for large-scale,
quantitative histological MRI studies
The above findings beg the following
question: what do GMD and the other
gray matter measures mean in terms of
biology? Multiple studies have shown that
the T1 signal is sensitive to myelin and
iron content, whose distributions overlap
significantly within cortical gray matter
(Stu
¨ber et al., 2014). Surprisingly, only a
few attempts have been made to quantify

Gennatas et al. • Gray Matter Development in Adolescence
 the relationships among histological fea-
tures and MRI-derived structural mea-
sures. A large number of studies using
T1-weighted imaging to quantify gray
matter have focused on neurodegenera-
tion. Such diseases result in neuronal loss,
which causes direct decreases in all gray
matter measures. This may partly explain
the confusion that has led to these mea-
sures often being considered highly corre-
lated or equivalent, and even grouped
together in meta-analyses (e.g., see Shao et
al., 2014). However, in the context of nor-
mal brain structure, or in brain disease
without extensive neuronal loss, includ-
ing most psychiatric disorders, regional
and global variation in different gray mat-
ter measures may be less correlated, even
anticorrelated, as seen here between GMD
and GMV. We expect that MRI-derived
gray matter measures are differentially de-
termined by a set of histological factors,
including neuronal and glial number and
size, dendritic arborization, the number
of axonal projections, and the extent of
myelination. Their effects will vary by age,
brain region, and cortical layer.
In adolescence, the MRI-estimated de-
cline in gray matter volume is generally
attributed to a combination of synaptic
pruning of exuberant connections, a re-
gressive event, and increasing myelina-
Figure 4.
Sex differences by modality by MNI label against age. The difference of male and female fitted values for each
modality for each MNI label was calculated at each year from 8 to 23 years of age. This plot highlights qualitatively how sex
differences vary with age, in most cases in a nonlinear fashion (a constant sex difference in any measure would appear as a
horizontal line). Note that only in CT the direction of the difference changes in frontal and occipital lobes as well as the bilateral
insula from a male to a female advantage.

Intermodal correlations averaged by MNI label. Pairwise spearman correlations (rho) were estimated between the fitted values of model 3 (top row) of all gray matter measures to
summarize the similarity of age-related effects among modalities and between their residuals (bottom row). Brain slices with these results are available on-line at https://egenn.github.io/

 tion, a progressive event, both of which are essential aspects of
normal development (Stiles and Jernigan, 2010). While pruning
results in a direct reduction in neuropil, myelination may have
multiple direct and indirect effects on T1-based gray matter
quantification. White matter myelination and expansion may re-
sult in a physical outward shift of the gray matter–white matter
boundary, causing gray matter to compact and leading to de-
creases in GMV and CT and increases in GMD. Alternatively,
myelination near the gray matter–white matter border may in-
crease signal intensity in voxels nearest the border enough to
switch their classification from gray to white, which would lead to
a reduction of volume and thickness measurements but have no
effect on density, since these voxels would now be excluded from
any gray matter parcels. At the same time, cortical gray matter
also contains substantial amounts of myelinated fibers with sig-
nificant regional variability (Nieuwenhuys, 2013), and intracor-
tical myelin also increases during adolescence (Grydeland et al.,
2013). Increasing cortical myelination would lead to a decrease in
estimated GMD, which means that GMD increases reported in
this study are possibly underestimates. Rabinowicz et al. (2009)
performed stereologic morphometry in six males and five females
ranging in age from 12 to 24 years and reported significantly
higher neuronal densities and neuronal number estimates in
males than in females, but no sex differences in cortical thickness,
suggesting higher neuropil mass/increased neuronal processes in
the female cortex, which might explain our findings of higher
GMD in females.
We chose to compare four different measures of regional gray
matter in volumetric space. Other morphometric and morpho-
logical measures like cortical surface area and gyrification index
can also be derived from T1 images in surface space analyses. The
limited positive correlation that we found between GMV and CT
age-related effects is probably explained by independent changes
in surface area and gyrification (Raznahan et al., 2011). While the
majority of brain regions show significant sex effects on GMV, as
expected, a minority of regions showed a significant sex effect on
CT. Considering that gray matter volume approximately equals
surface area times cortical thickness, we expect surface area to
exhibit more extensive sex differences than thickness. We limited
our analysis to volumetric space measures to use the same parcel-
lation for each measure and avoid the extra resampling and reg-
istration errors introduced in the conversion between the two
spaces (Klein et al., 2010). For the same reason, care must be
taken when comparing volumetric and surface space analyses.
Given the important gaps in our understanding of the links
between biology and imaging, it is crucial to design large-scale,
combined MRI and histological quantification studies to fully
characterize the neurobiological basis of raw MRI signals and
derived measures. Biophysical modeling of MR-derived mea-
sures will enable accurate noninvasive in vivo prediction of his-
tological features (Stiles and Jernigan, 2010). This will be crucial
in elevating the potential of neuroimaging in the investigation of
nervous system physiology and pathology, disease diagnosis, and
treatment monitoring.
Limitations and implication for future work: phenotypes of
structural brain development and links to cognition
The cross-sectional design of this study was its main limitation.
Ongoing longitudinal studies will provide true measures of de-
velopmental change and allow the analysis of interindividual dif-
ferences in development. Future studies would also benefit from
the inclusion of more MRI modalities. New diffusion-weighted
MRI techniques like neurite orientation dispersion and density
imaging may provide rich information on gray matter structure
and complement T1 and T2 signals (Zhang et al., 2012). Histo-
logical morphometry has shown cortical layer- and type-specific
changes in neuronal cell bodies (Rabinowicz et al., 2009), which
cannot be resolved with today’s common MRI sequences, but this
may be possible in the future. We must note that while different
segmentation software uses similar methods for GMD estima-
tion, results are dependent on parameter selection. Correla-
tion with histology will also help to guide these choices and
optimize pipelines to produce measures with maximal biolog-
ical interpretability.
Our results demonstrate that GMD, GMV, and CT must be
considered distinct and complementary. They also further em-
phasize the need for nonlinear modeling and accounting for sex
differences. We found that GMD and CT are most sensitive to
age, which makes them prime candidate biomarkers of brain
development. In contrast, modulated density or GMM may not
be very informative in a developmental context, and it is best to
consider GMD and GMV independently. We also show that in-
termodal relationships change with age, which further empha-
sizes that neuroimaging findings should not be generalized from
one age period to another. We have previously shown that struc-
tural covariance networks develop during childhood to mirror
adult functional intrinsic connectivity networks (Zielinski et al.,
2010). Ongoing work aims to identify how different structural
measures can be best applied to study cognition and disease.
As we advance from group-level to individual-level studies,
from unimodal to multimodal analyses, and from descriptive to
predictive models with the aim of integrating neuroimaging into
clinical practice, it is essential to make the best use of all available
data. The first step is to understand available measures and the
relationships among them. Development is a critical dimension
on which these relationships may vary and adds to the challenge
and the importance of this task.
