Summary
Background The mcr-1 gene confers transferable colistin resistance. mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae (MCRPE) have 
attracted substantial medical, media, and political attention; however, so far studies have not addressed their clinical 
impact. Herein, we report the prevalence of MCRPE in human infections and carriage, clinical associations of mcr-1-
positive Escherichia coli (MCRPEC) infection, and risk factors for MCRPEC carriage.
Methods We undertook this study at two hospitals in Zhejiang and Guangdong, China. We did a retrospective 
cross-sectional assessment of prevalence of MCRPE infection from isolates of Gram-negative bacteria collected at the 
hospitals from 2007 to 2015 (prevalence study). We did a retrospective case-control study of risk factors for infection and 
mortality after infection, using all MCRPEC from infection isolates and a random sample of mcr-1-negative E coli 
infections from the retrospective collection between 2012 and 2015 (infection study). We also did a prospective 
case-control study to assess risk factors for carriage of MCRPEC in rectal swabs from inpatients with MCRPEC and mcr-
1 negative at the hospitals and collected between May and December, 2015, compared with mcr-1-negative isolates from 
rectal swabs of inpatients (colonisation study). Strains were analysed for antibiotic resistance, plasmid typing, and 
transfer analysis, and strain relatedness.
Findings We identified 21 621 non-duplicate isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
from 18 698 inpatients and 2923 healthy volunteers. Of 17 498 isolates associated with infection, mcr-1 was detected in 
76 (1%) of 5332 E coli isolates, 13 (<1%) of 348 Klebsiella pneumoniae, one (<1%) of 890 Enterobacter cloacae, and 
one (1%) of 162 Enterobacter aerogenes. For the infection study, we included 76 mcr-1-positive clinical E coli isolates and 
508 mcr-1-negative isolates. Overall, MCRPEC infection was associated with male sex (209 [41%] vs 47 [63%], adjusted 
p=0·011), immunosuppression (30 [6%] vs 11 [15%], adjusted p=0·011), and antibiotic use, particularly carbapenems 
(45 [9%] vs 18 [24%], adjusted p=0·002) and fluoroquinolones (95 [19%] vs 23 [30%], adjusted p=0·017), before hospital 
admission. For the colonisation study, we screened 2923 rectal swabs from healthy volunteers, of which 19 were 
MCRPEC, and 1200 rectal swabs from patients, of which 35 were MCRPEC. Antibiotic use before hospital admission 
(p<0·0001) was associated with MCRPEC carriage in 35 patients compared with 378 patients with mcr-1-negative 
E coli colonisation, whereas living next to a farm was associated with mcr-1-negative E coli colonisation (p=0·03, 
univariate test). mcr-1 could be transferred between bacteria at high frequencies (10–¹ to 10–³), and plasmid types and 
MCRPEC multi-locus sequence types (MLSTs) were more variable in Guangdong than in Zhejiang and included the 
human pathogen ST131. MCRPEC also included 17 unreported ST clades.
Interpretation In 2017, colistin will be formally banned from animal feeds in China and switched to human therapy. 
Infection with MRCPEC is associated with sex, immunosuppression, and previous antibiotic exposure, while 
colonisation is also associated with antibiotic exposure. MLST and plasmid analysis shows that MCRPEC are diversely 
spread throughout China and pervasive in Chinese communities.

Introduction
The relentless increase in multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Gram-negative 
bacteria is worrying and has led to several global 
initiatives to unify national and international agenda to 
combat MDR and XDR infections.1–4 Global awareness 
was precipitated by the rapid dissemination of 
carbapenem resistance mechanisms such as NDM-1, 
KPC, and OXA-48/181, and the realisation of the small 
number of antibiotics left to treat serious infections, such 
as colistin.5–8 Until recently, colistin resistance was 
reported to be mediated by chromosomal mutations and 
possibly imposed a fitness cost to the organism.9,10 
Resistance to colistin is common in Klebsiella pneumoniae

and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but rare in Escherichia coli, 
and because of the complex mechanism involving 
lipopolysaccharide structures, the thought that this 
mechanism might become transferable was readily 
dismissed.11
However, we reported the gene encoding the first 
transferable colistin resistance mechanism, termed mcr-1, 
in Enterobacteriaceae of both food-producing animal and 
human origins.12 Colistin has not yet been approved for 
use in human beings in China, but it has been used in 
animals as a therapeutic drug and feed additive since the 
early 1980s. Thus, we speculated that the emergence and 
spread of mcr-1 probably occurred first in animals and 
spread to human beings.12 Colistin will soon be made 
available in China for use in human beings for the 
treatment of infections caused by MDR Gram-negative 
pathogens, 
such 
as 
carbapenem-resistant 
Entero-
bacteriaceae (CRE). However, the coexistence of mcr-1 
and carbapenem resistance genes, such as blaNDM-5/9 and 
blaKPC-2, identified in E coli from human infections and 
chicken meat, is of great concern, because the 
occurrence of the mcr-1 gene in CRE would seriously 
compromise treatment options not only in China but 
also globally.13
mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae (MCRPE) have 
been reported across southeast Asia, north Africa, 
Europe, and North America (appendix pp 1–15, 34). 
Hitherto, most of the bacteria carrying mcr-1 in human 
infections have been retrieved from historical studies 
with mcr-1 identified retrospectively from whole 
genome sequence data.14,15 Furthermore, very few 
clinical reports have shown the effect of MCRPE on 
patient outcomes and these reports had very small 
sample sizes.16
Although colistin is not yet used in clinical practice in 
China, it is commonly used as the last-line antibiotic 
in many countries, sometimes even for empirical 
treatment.8 In view of the increased reliance on colistin 
in the treatment of CRE and the intercontinental 
dissemination of mcr-1, the effect of the emergence of 
MCRPE in the clinical setting needs to be urgently 
addressed. We ascertained the prevalence of MCRPE, and 
the clinical associations and outcomes of mcr-1-positive 
E coli (MCRPEC) infections in patients in hospital from 
two provinces, Zhejiang and Guangdong. We also 
determine the prevalence of MCRPEC colon 
isation of 
patients in hospital and healthy volunteers and examine 
risk factors for carriage among patients. We have applied 
multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis comparing 
MCRPEC and non-MCRPEC causing infections.
Methods
Study design and materials
We undertook this epidemiological and clinical study at 
two geographically remote tertiary care hospitals in 
Zhejiang and Guangdong, China. Each hospital contains 
more than 3000 beds and serves mainly Hangzhou 
(catchment of 9 million people) and Guangzhou 
(catchment of 13·5 million people), the capital cities, as 
well as a wider catchment area for neighbouring cities in 
each province.
First, we did a retrospective cross-sectional study to 
assess the prevalence and clinical characteristics of 
MCRPE (prevalence study). We included non-duplicate 
clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp, 
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from inpatients collected 
between Jan 1, 2007, and April 30, 2015 (figure 1), as part 
of a study of β-lactam resistance (appendix p 16). For the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
On May 15, 2016, we searched PubMed with the terms 
“clinical burden and Enterobacteriaceae and China (number of 
examples found, one from meta-analysis)”, “MCR-1 and clinical 
infections (two cases—our ref—16)”, and “MCR-1 and fecal 
carriage (no refs)”, for reports published between Jan 1, 2000, and 
June 30, 2016. We did not restrict our search by language of 
publication. We found no systematic Chinese study examining the 
burden of disease by Gram-negative bacteria. The only report on 
clinical cases of MCR-1-positive infections described two cases 
from South Africa. Our search identified no systematic screening 
on carriage and no multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) profiling 
on strain relatedness. Only a few studies have been done on mcr-1 
plasmids.
Added value of this study
To the best our knowledge, this study is the first multiprovince 
clinical study on Gram-negative infections with colistin resistance 
in China, the first systematic clinical study on mcr-1-positive 
Escherichia coli (MCRPEC) examining associations and outcomes, 
the first examining MCRPEC carriage in hospitals and 
communities, and applying risk factors for carriage, and the first 
applying MLST analysis examining strain relatedness for MCRPEC 
infections. Further, this study is a large conjugation study 
examining mcr-1 plasmid transfer and typing.
Implications of all the available evidence
The emergence of MCR-1 heralds the breach of the last group of 
antibiotics, polymixins, by plasmid-mediated resistance. 
The withdrawal of colstin in China from animal feed and its 
introduction into the clinic might reduce colistin resistance rates 
in the community and increase resistance in hospitals. Our study 
suggests that there are already significant risk factors for MCRPEC 
infections and these are likely to be exacerbated when colistin is 
used clinically. Furthermore, the carriage of MCRPEC as normal 
flora does not seem to be associated with rural living or diet, 
suggesting other factors, including environmental dissemination 
of MCR-1, might be associated with MCRPEC carriage.

prevalence study, we included patients who had been 
admitted for 2 or more days at any units of the 
two hospitals and who had a sample taken more than 
48 h after admission. We excluded patients with all forms 
of gastroenteritis and those with active bleeding from the 
rectum or anal fissures. The source of infection was 
determined as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, 
surgical 
site 
infection, 
intra-abdominal 
infection, 
line-related infection, or bacteraemia as defined by the 
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.17
Second, we did a retrospective case-control study to 
assess risk factors for infection and 30-day mortality 
after infection with MCRPEC (infection study; figure 1). 
We included all MCRPEC identified in the prevalence 
study, and a sample of mcr-1-negative E coli infection 
(ten times the number of positive isolates) selected by a 
blinded random draw done by the investigators. For the 
random selection, we assigned a continuing number, 
which did not indicate any medical information, for all 
inpatients, followed with putting all the numbers into an 
electronic pool in a computer, and then selecting the 
numbers with a computer mouse. We included mcr-1-
negative isolates collected between Jan 1, 2012, and 
April 30, 2015, because no mcr-1-positive isolates were 
collected during 2007–11 (appendix p 17). 
We also did a prospective case-control study to assess 
risk factors for carriage of MCRPEC (colonisation study; 
figure 1). We included isolates from rectal swabs 
collected at the hospitals and rectal swabs from healthy 
volunteers attending primary care practices for routine 
annual physical examinations, collected from May 1, to 
Dec 31, 2015, assessed using clinical microbiology. For 
the random selection, we used the method described 
previously for the infection study. We compared risk 
factors for MCRPEC carriage (mcr-1-positive cases from 
inpatients) with mcr-1-negative E coli isolates from 
inpatients selected by a blinded random draw (12 times 
the number of positive isolates). For the colonisation 
study, we included isolates from rectal samples collected 
within 24 h of admission to hospital for the inpatients 
who were admitted for more than 2 days, and samples 
collected within 12 h of physical examination for the 
healthy volunteers. We excluded neonates, pregnant 
women, 
patients 
or 
healthy 
volunteers 
with 
gastroenteritis, and patients with gastrointestinal cancer, 
gastrointestinal surgery, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal

Ethical approval was given by The Second Affiliated 
Hospital of Zhejiang University and Sun Yat-Sen 
University ZhongShan School of Medicine. Individual 
consent forms were translated into Mandarin and 
consent was obtained for all inpatients and healthy 
volunteers either face to face or by phone. We excluded 
patients from whom we could not obtain consent 
(eg, patient had moved or had died). All participants held 
the right to withdraw from the study at any stage.
Procedures
For analysis of risk factors during infection, we 
procured data from electronic medical records on 
patient demographics, underlying medical conditions, 
site of infection, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, 
presence of immunosuppressive factors (eg, AIDS, use 
of corticosteroids for more than 7 days), antibiotic 
use within 3 months before hospital admission or in 
hospital before isolation of pathogen, and clinical 
outcomes at 30 days.
For the analysis of risk factors of colonisation study, 
we obtained patient demographics, ICU admission, 
residence, proximity to commercial animal farms, 
education and income, diets and drinking water, and 
antibiotic use before and during hospital admission 
from medical records and a survey questionnaire.  To 
reduce the potential recall bias on the risk factor of 
proximity to commercial animal farms, we checked the 
location of home addresses with Google maps and 
Baidu maps to confirm proximity to farms.
We initially identified all isolates from the retrospective 
collection (figure 1) using Columbia blood agar (Oxoid, 
Hampshire, UK) with 5% sheep blood (Luqiao, 
Beijing, China), and identified species by MALDI-TOF 
mass spectrometry (BrukerDaltonik GmbH, Bremen, 
Germany). Where the species could not be well 
interpreted by MALDI-TOF, we applied 16S rDNA 
sequencing. We screened isolates from rectal samples 
for the colonisation study by inoculating on Columbia 
blood agar. Only one suspected Enterobacteriaceae 
isolate was analysed per sample. To determine presence 
of MCRPE from rectal samples and all clinical isolates 
we assessed growth on media containing 2 mg/L of 
colistin. All isolates were subsequently screened for 
mcr-1 by PCR and sequencing.12
We deteremined the plasmid or chromosomal location 
of mcr-1 gene in all MCRPEC isolates from both clinical 
and carriage isolates using the method previously 
described.12 We investigated the frequency of transfer 
of mcr-1-carrying plasmid in both the infection and 
colonisation E coli isolates by conjugation experiments 
using streptomycin-resistant E coli C600 or rifampicin-
resistant E coli EC600 as the recipient strains, and 
transfer frequencies were calculated as the number of 
transconjugants per recipient. Antimicrobial susceptibility 
testing of all MCRPEC, as well as the mcr-1-negative E coli 
isolates used in the infection and colonisation studies, was 
done by agar dilution and interpreted according to 
European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility 
Testing clinical breakpoints (version 6.0), and the Clinical 
and Laboratory Standards Institute document M100-S25.18
Whole cell DNA of all MCRPEC was prepared with the 
Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Beijing, 
China), submitted to whole genome sequencing,18 and a 
draft assembly of the sequences was done with the CLC 
Genomics Workbench 8.5 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). 
MLST, Mob typing, and Inc typing of mcr-1-positive 
isolates of both wild-type and transconjugants were done 
by searching the assembled contigs of the recognised 
chromosomal or plasmid sequences, and by specific PCR 
assays as needed. Sequence types (STs) and corresponding 
MLST gene allele profiles were entered into BioNumerics 
(Applied Maths, Belgium). The BURST algorithm was 
used to relate STs between various criteria of geographical 
location and clinical history.
Statistical analysis
Clinical data were collected and collated into specifically 
designed databases within Microsoft Excel 2013 and 
Minitab17 statistical software. Databases were password 
protected throughout the course of the study. We 
calculated risk factors for mcr-1-positive E coli infection 
and colonisation using a two-stage approach. We used 
univariate statistical tests to assess key risk factors for 
potential association. Those significant at the 10% level

were entered into multivariable logistic regression using 
IBM SPSS software. Separate models were fitted for 
overall antibiotic use and exploration of the effect of 
individual classes of antibiotics. Given the categorical 
nature of the variables, binary data were tested by 
χ² analysis or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous data were 
tested with the Mann-Whitney U test.

Results
Prevalence of mcr-1
For the prevalence study, we analysed 17 498 isolates from 
18 698 inpatients, including 10 688 Enterobacteriaceae, 
3549 Acinetobacter spp, and 3261 P aeruginosa (figure 1). We 
detected mcr-1 in 76 (1%) of 5332 E coli, 13 (<1%) of 
3480 K pneumoniae, one (<1%) of 890 E cloacae, and 
one (1%) of 162 Enterobacter aerogenes. Over the sampling 
period, we noted a general increase in the prevalence of 
mcr-1-positive E coli in both hospitals (appendix p 17). 
A non-linear increase in mcr-1-positive K pneumoniae was 
also noted (appendix p 18).
For the colonisation study, we analysed rectal swabs of 
1200 inpatients and 2923 healthy volunteers, from 
which we identified 4123 Enterobacteriaceae. 35 (3%) of 
1199 E coli isolates from inpatients were positive for 
mcr-1, and one of one E cloacae isolate from inpatients 
was positive; 19 (1%) of 2923 E coli isolates from healthy 
volunteers were positive for mcr-1.
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) profiles of 
MCRPEC and mcr-1-negative E coli isolates
In the infection study, resistance was significantly more 
common in E coli isolates with mcr-1 (n=76) than in 
those without mcr-1 (n=508) for most antimicrobial 
drugs 
tested, 
including 
not 
only 
colistin 
and 
polymyxin B, but also amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 
cefotaxime, 
ceftazidime, 
cefepime, 
gentamicin, 
amikacin, ertapenem, fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and 
ciprofloxacin (table 1).
There were large differences in MIC50 between 
MCRPEC isolates from inpatients with infections (n=76) 
and those from rectal swabs in healthy people (n=19), 
with differences of more than 32-fold for ampicillin, 
512-fold for cefotaxime, 64-fold for ceftazidime, 64-fold for 
cefepime, and 64-fold for ciprofloxacin (appendix p 19). 
However, the MIC50 values from clinical E coli isolates 
from inpatients with infections (n=76) were similar to the 
isolates from rectal swabs from inpatients (n=35), 
except for ceftazidime, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, 
which were eight-fold, 32-fold and 16-fold higher, 
respectively (appendix p 29).
Coexistence of mcr-1 and carbapenem resistance
Among all 146 MCRPE (91 from the retrospective collection 
and 55 from the colonisation collection), five E coli 
isolates from clinical samples were carbapenem resistant: 
three from Zhejiang and two from Guangdong. All 
five isolates were resistant to ertapenem, with MICs of 
4 mg/L (n=2), 8 mg/L (n=2), and 64 mg/L (n=1), whereas 
only one isolate (ZJ487 from an intra-abdominal fluid 
sample in Zhejiang) was resistant to imipenem 
(>256 mg/L) and had intermediate resistance to 
meropenem (4 mg/L); the other four isolates were 
susceptible to both imipenem and meropenem. Four of 
these five inpatients with CRE recovered after treatment, 
with only one inpatient from Guangdong without

improvement. Screening for carba 
penem resistance genes 
among the five carbapenem-resistant E coli harbouring 
mcr-1 showed that two isolates, the ZJ487 with ST90 from 
intra-abdominal fluid of an inpatient from Zhejiang and 
GD50 with ST744 from a faecal sample of a healthy 
volunteer from Guangdong, were blaNDM-1-positive. Further 
analysis showed that blaNDM-1 and mcr-1 were located on the 
chromosome and on plasmids of these isolates, 
respectively. In addition to blaNDM-1, isolate ZJ487 carried 
blaTEM-1, blaSHV-12, blaCTX-M-55, and blaOXA-1 and isolate GD50 
carried blaTEM-1, blaSHV-12, blaCTX-M-14, and blaCTX-M-15. The other 
three isolates were negative for carbapenemase genes but 
were extended-spectrum β-lactamase-positive (eg, blaCTX-M-15 
in two isolates and blaCTX-M-55 in another).
Risk factors
For the infection study, we collected clinical data from 
76 
mcr-1-positive 
isolates 
and 
randomly 
selected 
760 mcr-1-negative clinical E coli isolates (of which 252 were 
excluded because of incomplete data, leaving 508) from 4609 E 
coli infection cases. 30-day mortality was 7·3% for mcr-1-
negative infections and 11·8% for mcr-1-positive infections. 
Being male, immunosuppressed, or having received 
antibiotics in the past 3 months were significant risk factors 
for mcr-1-positive infection (table 2). Use of carbapenems 
and fluoroquinolones in the previous 3 months was 
particularly associated with increased risk. Patient age was not 
associated with mcr-1-positivity (table 2). We saw no association 
with either mcr-1-positive or mcr-1-negative infections in 
patients with neutropenia or undergoing artificial lung 
ventilation (table 2). With only two regions (Guangdong and 
Zhejiang), we analysed region as a fixed effect and it was no 
longer significant in the multivariable model (table 2).
In the colonisation study, we identified 35 MCRPEC 
isolates from rectal swabs of inpatients. We randomly 
selected 420 mcr-1-negative isolates from inpatients for 
comparison, of which 42 were excluded because of 
incomplete data, leaving 378 isolates of mcr-1-negative 
E coli (figure 1; table 3). Antibiotic use before hospital 
admission was a major risk factor for colonisation by 
mcr-1-positive E coli (unadjusted p=0·0008; adjusted 
p<0·0001). Living in proximity to livestock was a risk 
factor for colonisation by mcr-1-negative E coli in the 
unadjusted analysis (p=0·03) but not in the adjusted 
analysis (p=0·995; table 3).
In addition, we analysed all associations and outcomes 
for both mcr-1-negative E coli and MCRPEC comparing 
Guangdong with Zhejiang (appendix pp 20–26). 
Significant differences were noted in several social 
aspects between the two regions, including living place, 
education, income, diet, and drinking water.
High frequency of transfer of mcr-1 carrying plasmids
S1-pulsed field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting 
of 130 MCRPEC (76 from the infection study and 54 [one 
isolate had lost the plasmid during this stage of the 
analysis and could not be included in these data] from 
the colonisation study) showed that mcr-1 was located on 
plasmids with sizes ranging from 32 kb to 400 kb in 
123 isolates, and on the chromosome in seven isolates 
(appendix pp 25–33). Among the 123 isolates carrying 
mcr-1 on plasmids, mcr-1 was successfully transferred to 
E coli EC600 or C600 on 42 (34%) occasions. Frequency 
of transfer differed substantially, ranging from 10–¹ to 
10–¹⁰, while 29 (69%) of these 42 isolates had high 
conjugation rates (10–¹ to 10–³; appendix pp 25–33).

plasmids in the transconjugants were characterised. 
IncX4 and IncI2 were the most prevalent Inc types 
identified in 13 and 14 transconjugants, respectively. 
Other Inc types included F (n=7), K (n=6), FIB (n=6), I1-
1γ (n=6), N (n=4), and FIIS (n=1). 11 trans 
conjugants 
were non-typeable using the current Inc classification. 
Mob typing showed that P51 and F12 were found in 11 
and nine transconjugants, respectively. Both H121 and 
Qu were found in one transconjugant, but 24 trans-
conjugants could not be typed using the Mob system 
(appendix pp 25–33).
Diversity of MCRPEC strains
We assessed clonality and clades of both mcr-1-negative 
and mcr-1-positive E coli strains from the infection study 
(figure 1) as minimum spanning trees for Guangdong 
(figure 2A) and Zhejiang (figure 2B). Both the number 
and diversity of strains enrolled from Guangdong were 
greater than those from Zhejiang, with Guangdong 
having 21 ST clades representing five or more E coli 
compared with eight STs from Zhejiang. From these 
clades, mcr-1-positive E coli were found in ST602, ST101, 
ST410, ST95, ST1193, ST354, ST156, ST10, ST117, ST405, 
ST131, and ST457 from Guangdong compared with 
ST410, ST617, ST10, ST648, and ST354 form Zhejiang 
(figure 2, appendix pp 25–35). Overall, our data suggest 
substantial horizontal dissemination of mcr-1 through 
E coli populations; mcr-1 was found in 30 (26%) of 116 ST 
clades from Guangdong and 25 (34%) of 73 ST clades 
from Zhejiang. Many of these ST clades were large, 
including ST131, ST95, ST1193, and ST405 from 
Guangdong. mcr-1 was not found in substantial E coli 
clades such as ST69, ST648, and ST38. By contrast with 
Guangdong, mcr-1 was not identified in the clades ST131, 
ST1193, or ST405 in Zhejiang. Across all tested samples, 
we discovered isolates in 17 new distinct STs carrying 
mcr-1.
The clades identified among the carriage isolates (both 
hospital and community) from the colonisation study 
were diverse from both Zhejiang and Guangdong with 
some commonality in the clades isolated from clinical 
samples—eg, ST10, ST156, ST117, and ST131 (figure 3). 
However, ST48, ST4014, and ST58 were not isolated 
clinically (figure 3).

Discussion
MCRPE gained global attention after our finding of the 
mobile 
colistin 
resistance 
mechanism 
MCR-1.12 
Following our report of emergence of MCR-1 in both 
animals and human beings, we undertook a compre-
hensive study on the prevalence, clinical association, 
and carriage of MCRPE in human beings. Analysis of 
the different associations and outcomes from all 
infections (mcr-1-negative and MCRPEC) showed one 
unexpected result. There was a gender bias (p=0·011) in 
whether the infection was mcr-1 positive with a 
male:female 
ratio 
of 
41:59 
for 
mcr-1 
negative 
Enterobacteriaceae and 63:37 for MCRPEC infections. 
Unsurprisingly, previous antibiotic exposure was 
strongly associated with the presence of mcr-1-positive 
infection. In view of the potential of mcr-1 to coexist 
with other resistance genes on the same plasmids, 
coselection of mcr-1 with other antibiotics, regardless of 
the use of colistin in human beings in China, is a likely 
scenario. Our first study of MCRPE showed close 
association with animals and husbandry practices and 
thus we anticipated a positive association with close 
proximity to farms.12 Counter 
intuitively, however, we 
observed a weak association for MCRPEC carriage with 
living distantly from farms.
MLST analysis shows the extreme divergence of E coli 
strains carrying mcr-1 not only between Zhejiang and 
Guangdong, but also within each hospital. MCRPEC 
could be divided into 30 different clades from Guangdong 
and 25 from Zhejiang, in most cases these involved only 
one representative isolate. Of these mcr-1-positive clades, 
only ST10, ST410, and ST354 were common to both 
regions. The diversity of strains carrying mcr-1 is further 
shown by the fact that 17 isolates belonged to new or 
unreported MLST groups. The high level of heterogeneity 
is supported by our data showing high transmission rates 
of mcr-1-carrying plasmids into laboratory recipients 
(transconjugants), with the dominant Inc type being 
IncX4 that has been previously reported in blaCTX-M-carrying 
E coli from both human beings and food animals in Hong 
Kong, China.19 66% of isolates carrying plasmid-borne 
mcr-1 could not be transferred into recipient E coli isolates, 
although increased transfer frequencies were observed in 
some other E coli isolates from this study. Although 
Guangdong and Zhejiang have common mcr-1-positive 
ST groups, these E coli clades have different plasmid 
backbones, suggesting independent acquisition of mcr-1 
by these STs (appendix pp 25–33).
E coli ST156 belongs to phylogenetic group A and is 
generally not considered to be highly virulent, although 
a recent study from Spain would suggest otherwise.20 
ST156 has been previously reported from China and 
associated with MDR and XDR phenotypes, but mainly 
from poultry.21,22 E coli ST101 is widely regarded as having 
environmental lineage and being associated with water 
and sewerage, and also poultry; however, it has been 
associated with carbapenem resistance and XDR clinical 
outbreaks.22,23 To the best of our knowledge, this study is 
the first report of E coli ST101 in mainland China. E coli 
ST95 is now thought to be more pathogenic than are 
ST156 and ST101 and considered a human and avian 
pathogen.24 E coli ST10 has only previously been reported 
from animals in China and thus this is the first report 
of ST10 from human infections in China.25 ST131 has 
 
long been recognised as the virulent global epidemic 
strain associated with human disease and also displaying 
MDR and XDR phenotypes.26 Until now, the only ST131 
isolate reported carrying mcr-1 was from chicken meat 
imported into Denmark.27 In this study, we describe 
three ST131 mcr-1-positive isolates from Guangdong that 
would suggest colistin resistance might be associated 
with poorer clinical outcome than other STs. Chinese 
reports on patient infections suggest that E coli ST131 is

prevalent28 and thus, the probability of mcr-1 plasmids 
further being disseminated among these pathogenic 
E coli seem highly likely. However, in this study, the 
patients infected with mcr-1-positive E coli ST131 causing 
skin and soft tissue, bloodstream, and urinary tract 
infections recovered, suggesting that in this limited 
sample mcr-1-positive E coli ST131 strains were not 
pathogenic. Some clades only found in carriage 
isolates—eg, ST48, ST4014, and ST58—were not isolated 
clinically, suggesting they could be less likely to cause 
disease.
We acknowledge several limitations in our study. 
First, although we noted significant increases of 
mcr-1-harbouring clinical isolates during 2012–15 
compared with 2007–11, these were from retrospective 
data taken from samples in 2012–15. The possibility of 
loss of mcr-1-carrying plasmids during storage cannot be 
excluded, and so the prevalence of mcr-1 and numbers of 
colistin resistance phenotypes from these retrospectively 
collected isolates might be underestimated. Second, we 
only included 378 (33%) of 1164 mcr-1-negative 
colonisation isolates and 508 (11%) of 4533 mcr-1-negative 
infection isolates for MLST. Analysis of more isolates for 
MLST would provide a more compelling database and a 
greater case for strain relatedness between isolates. 
Third, we have noted differences between Guangdong 
and Zhejiang provinces, but cannot further speculate as 
to why these differences have occurred without more in-
depth observations and analysis and they might not be 
generalisable across other provinces and all of China. 
Last, the risk factors that were reported by the patients 
and the volunteers might be confounded by recall bias.
Although there have been many reports of carbapenem 
resistance in Chinese hospitals, most MCRPEC were 
carbapenem-susceptible; however, in this study, resistance 
to ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, and cefepime was especially 
common. These results suggest that MCRPEC were able 
to recruit other resistance genes and become multiply 
drug-resistant, which could raise difficulties in the 
treatment of patients with clinical infection due to 
MCRPEC. Despite the fact that almost all MCRPEC were 
colistin-resistant, clinical colistin resistance in China is 
somewhat of an enigma because colistin is not generally 
used in human beings. The first report of mcr-1 in China 
resulted in substantial policy discussions and has 
encouraged the withdrawal of colistin.29 In part, this report 
is likely to advocate the use of colistin in Chinese patients 
and its subsequent withdrawal from the farming sector. 
Accordingly, this study provides a useful baseline of 
colistin resistance to monitor the effect of its introduction 
and provide predictive outcomes on treatment failures.
