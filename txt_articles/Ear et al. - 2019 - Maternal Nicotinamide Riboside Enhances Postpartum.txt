In Brief
Postpartum constitutes a profound
episode of metabolic stress. Ear et al.
show that nicotinamide riboside
supplementation of rodent mothers
relieves postpartum metabolic stress and
increases lactation, nursing behavior, and
transmission of brain-derived
neurotrophic factor into milk, resulting in
improved physical and neurobehavioral
development of offspring, whose
advantages persist into adulthood.

SUMMARY
Conditions of metabolic stress dysregulate the
NAD metabolome. By restoring NAD, nicotinamide
riboside (NR) provides resistance to such conditions.
We tested the hypotheses that postpartum might
dysregulate
maternal
NAD
and
that
increasing
systemic NAD with NR might benefit mothers and
offspring. In postpartum mothers, the liver NAD me-
tabolome is depressed while blood increases circu-
lation of NAD metabolites to enable a >20-fold
increase in mammary NAD+ and NADP+. Lactation
and NR synergize in stimulating prolactin synthesis
and mammary biosynthetic programs. NR supple-
mentation of new mothers increases lactation and
nursing behaviors and stimulates maternal transmis-
sion of macronutrients, micronutrients, and BDNF
into milk. Pups of NR-supplemented mothers are
advantaged in glycemic control, size at weaning,
and synaptic pruning. Adult offspring of mothers
supplemented during nursing retain advantages
in physical performance, anti-anxiety, spatial mem-
ory, delayed onset of behavioral immobility, and
promotion of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
Thus, postgestational maternal micronutrition con-
fers lasting advantages to offspring.
INTRODUCTION
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and related co-en-
zymes are the central mediators of virtually all metabolic pro-
cesses (Belenky et al., 2007; Bogan and Brenner, 2008). Despite
the importance of maintaining sufficient levels and redox ratios
of NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH, a variety of metabolic
stresses disturb one or more NAD metabolites. In the liver, alcohol
depresses the NAD+/NADH ratio (Cederbaum, 2012), while over-
nutrition and type 2 diabetes depress NADP+ and NADPH (Tram-
mell et al., 2016b). When DNA is damaged, tissue NAD+ is
consumed by poly(ADPribose) polymerase (Bouchard et al.,
2003), and NADPH can be depleted by reactive oxygen species
(Pollak et al., 2007). Target tissue NAD+ is depressed in noise-
induced hearing loss (Brown et al., 2014), central brain injury
(Vaur et al., 2017), and heart failure (Diguet et al., 2018). In addi-
tion, liver NAD+ is dysregulated by circadian disruption (Sato
et al., 2017), and tissue NAD+ reportedly declines as vertebrates
age (Braidy et al., 2014). In many of these diseases and condi-
tions, the ability to salvage nicotinamide (NAM) is dampened,
while the nicotinamide riboside (NR) kinase 1 and/or 2 genes
(Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004) are transcriptionally induced
(Diguet et al., 2018; Vaur et al., 2017). By repletion of the stress-
challenged NAD metabolome, NR is an orally active agent that
ameliorates diseases and conditions of metabolic stress in ro-
dents (Brown et al., 2014; Diguet et al., 2018; Hou et al., 2018;
Trammell et al., 2016b; Vaur et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016).
Consequently, NR is also being tested in human diseases and
conditions (Dollerup et al., 2018) and is in human use as a nutri-
tional supplement (Martens et al., 2018; Trammell et al., 2016a).
Postpartum constitutes an understudied episode of metabolic
stress in which a new mother experiences a storm of hormonal
alterations and sleep disruption, while her pituitary, liver, and
mammary become programmed for lactation, and she under-
takes the physical and emotional caretaking of her offspring
(Brown et al., 2006). Maternal health influences milk quantity,
milk quality, and neonatal health, which affect brain development
and somatic health through mechanisms that are incompletely
defined (Innis, 2014).
We initially hypothesized that increasing systemic NAD meta-
bolism during gestation and postpartum might support post-
partum weight loss and allow neonates to resist the effects of
maternal obesity. In the course of doing these experiments, we
discovered that adding NR to normal chow (NC) solely in the
21 days in which new mouse and rat mothers are co-housed
with pups produces a series of profound effects on maternal
metabolism and juvenile development, which result in persistent
physical, neurobehavioral, and neurodevelopmental advantages
to the adult offspring of NR-supplemented mothers.
Lactation is known to ramp up macronutrient mobilization to
and macronutrient synthesis by the mammary (Barber et al.,

 1992) for the benefit of neonates in a process termed homeo-
rhesis (Bauman and Currie, 1980). Here we discovered that
the hepatic and mammary NAD systems are profoundly altered
during the postpartum period, with the liver sacrificing and
distributing its NAD metabolome to provide a strikingly elevated
set of NAD co-enzymes in mammary. We found that oral NR re-
lieves the depressed liver NAD metabolome and superinduces
mobilization of NAD precursors by liver and mammary. Further-
more, NR boosts prolactin (PRL) expression by the pituitary and
results in increased milk production and increased time of
arched-back nursing. Milk produced by NR-supplemented
mothers is as rich in protein, fat, and carbohydrate as milk
from nonsupplemented mothers but is more plentiful and
contains higher levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), a growth factor that enhances juvenile brain develop-
ment (Egan et al., 2003; Huang and Reichardt, 2001; Huang
et al., 1999; Martinowich et al., 2007). Moreover, offspring of
NR-supplemented mothers have better glycemic control and
are larger at weaning. Offspring of NR-supplemented mothers
have multiple behavioral advantages, which include decreased
anxiety-like behavior, resistance to the onset of behavioral
immobility, improved spatial memory, and enhanced motor
learning and performance. These advantages were apparent
in 15-day-old pups and persisted into adulthood, despite the
fact that the intervention was to the mother and only lasted
from parturition to weaning at 21 days. Finally, we showed
that the adult offspring of NR-supplemented mothers have
increased hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus.
These data show that in rodents, a new mother’s metabolism
and maternal functions can be enhanced by increasing her
systemic
NAD
synthesis,
thereby
conferring
long-lasting
advantages to her offspring.
RESULTS
NR Promotes Postpartum Weight Loss in Mice and
Increases Lactation in Mice and Rats
In male mice, NR protects against high-fat diet-induced weight
gain (Canto
´ et al., 2012) and hepatic steatosis (Trammell et al.,
2016b). By performing quantitative targeted NAD metabolo-
mics, we discovered that obesity and type 2 diabetes
modestly depress hepatic NAD+ and greatly depress hepatic
NADP+ and NADPH (Trammell et al., 2016b). One previous
study examined the effect of NR on female rodents, that is,
prevention and reversal of chemotherapeutic neuropathy in
female rats (Hamity et al., 2017). We considered that the
female life cycle has unique developmental features that might
be addressed by increasing NAD+-dependent fuel oxidation
programs and NADPH-dependent biosynthetic and detoxifica-
tion pathways. Thus, we hypothesized that pregnancy and
postpartum constitute
metabolic
stresses that
might
be
addressed by oral supplementation with NR and that the
metabolic stresses of pregnancy and postpartum might be
aggravated by obesity.
As shown in Figure S1A, we used two male C57BL/6NJ males
to impregnate 16 18-week-old females of the same strain. Four
females were given NC; four, NC supplemented with 3 g/kg
NR chloride (NR); four, a 60% fat high-fat diet (HFD); and four,
HFD supplemented with 3 g/kg NR (HFDNR). This degree of
high-fat feeding produced a high proportion of stillbirths—there
were only 2 live births to 1 HFDNR-fed mother and no live births
to any HFD mother—rendering it impossible to assess advan-
tages of offspring of NR-supplemented mothers in the obese co-
horts. Because fecundity was normal in the NC and NR cohorts,
we continued NC-fed mothers on NC and NR-fed mothers on NR
and made three surprising observations. First, 22-day-old pups
of NR-fed mothers were protected against fasting-induced
hypoglycemia (Figure S1B). Second, we noticed that 15- to 21-
day-old pups of NR-fed mothers were more active than pups
of nonsupplemented mothers. Third, NR-supplemented mothers
lost 3 g of weight in the 21-day postpartum period compared
with 1.5 g lost by NC-fed mothers in the same period
(Figure S1C).
We hypothesized that NR-supplemented mothers might lose
weight by virtue of increased lactation. To test this hypothesis
and to determine whether supplementing mothers solely in the
postpartum period is sufficient for increased weight loss, we
generated a new cohort of mice. In these and subsequent exper-
iments (Figure 1A), dams were 12 weeks old when mated and
were exclusively fed NC prior to parturition. Thus, the NR inter-
vention was only for the 21 days in which pups were co-housed
with their mothers. At 21 days, pups were weaned, and whether
the mother was fed NC or NR, all cages were provided with NC.
As shown in Figure 1B, mothers fed NR lost an average of 0.95 g
of body weight during these 3 weeks, whereas mothers on NC
gained 1.88 g during the 3 weeks. We note that because
12-week-old mice have not reached maximal size, the younger
age of this and subsequent maternal cohorts precludes the
weight loss by NC-fed mothers observed in Figure S1C. As
shown in Figure 1C, despite their weight loss, NR-supplemented
mothers tend to eat more than NC-fed mothers. As shown in
Figures S1D and S1E, NR-supplemented mothers lose body
weight with a loss of fat mass and retention of lean mass.
In principle, mothers with more pups might be expected to be
advantaged in weight loss, while pups from smaller litters might
be advantaged in weight gain (Habbout et al., 2013). Cross-
fostering is an approach to normalize litter size, particularly after
a gestational intervention. However, because cross-fostering
introduces unwanted behavioral and physical effects (Bartolo-
mucci et al., 2004) and because our intervention was post-partu-
rition, we avoided this intervention. As shown in Figure 1D, the
mean litter size of mothers who were given NC (6.4) and NR
(7.1) was nearly identical (n = 8, p = 0.48).
On days 7, 14, and 21 postpartum, mothers were separated
from their pups for 4 h, given a 2 IU/kg dose of oxytocin, and
milked for 15 min. As shown in Figure 1E, NR supplementation
results in increased lactation, particularly at day 14. To test
whether NR promotes increased lactation in another species,
we performed the same experiment in Fisher 344 rats with an
oxytocin dose of 4 IU/kg and confirmed that oral NR increases
lactation (Figure S1F). As shown in Figures S1G–S1L, milk from
NR-supplemented mouse and rat mothers has a normal density
of total fat, carbohydrate, and protein. Thus, increased milk pro-
duction by NR-supplemented mothers indicates that provision of
oral NR increases maternal metabolism and transmission of
macronutrients to offspring.

 Oral NR Increases NR Transmission to Milk but Is Not
Directly Transmitted to Milk
NR is a natural product that is found in milk and is highly stable in
milk (Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004; Trammell et al., 2016c).
Thus, we aimed to test what effect oral NR would have on the
milk NAD metabolome and whether the mother’s oral NR is
directly transmitted to milk or has targets in the mother’s tissues.
As shown in Figure 1F, the two NAD precursor vitamins that were
found in bovine milk by liquid chromatography-mass spectrom-
etry (LC-MS) (Trammell et al., 2016c), namely NAM and NR, are
present in mouse milk at higher concentrations when mothers

were NR supplemented. As with macro-
nutrients, with a greater degree of lacta-
tion, mothers would transmit more micro-
nutrients by transmitting greater volumes
of milk. To test whether oral NR is directly
transmitted to offspring, we used a dou-
ble-labeled NR in which the NAM and
ribose moieties each incorporate a heavy
atom (Ratajczak et al., 2016). The chloride
salt of this compound (185 mg/kg) was
introduced by gavage to lactating mice
at day 13 post-parturition. At 2–24 h
post-gavage,
mice
were
milked.
As
shown in Figure 1G, these mice trans-
mitted nonlabeled NAM and NR at the expected concentrations.
Single-labeled NAM was detected over the time course, but dou-
ble-labeled NR was never found in milk. These data suggest that
NR has targets in maternal organs that serve to mobilize macro-
nutrients and micronutrients for transmission to neonates.
Postpartum Drives an NAD Metabolome Circulation
Program in Liver that Is Stimulated by NR
Liver is one of the primary sites of NR metabolism (Liu et al.,
2018; Trammell et al., 2016a). Because obesity and type 2 dia-
betes moderately depress hepatic NAD+ and greatly depress

971
 hepatic NADP+ and NADPH (Trammell et al., 2016b), we aimed
to determine whether postpartum might alter the liver NAD sys-
tem. To address this question, we generated a cohort of new
mouse dams that were fed either NC or NR after parturition.
Though they were kept with pups in order to allow the normal
postpartum and lactation program to proceed, they were sacri-
ficed at day 14, which is at peak lactation. As shown in Figure 2A,
at day 14 after parturition, in NC-fed mothers, hepatic NAD+ is
significantly depressed with respect to the NAD+ level in age-
matched females. However, supplementation of new mothers
with NR allowed them to increase their liver NAD+ and increase
levels of hepatic NAAD, NAM, and N-methylnicotinamide
(MeNAM) (Figures 2B–2D). These NAD metabolomic changes
were accompanied by the simultaneous increase in mRNA
and protein expression of key enzymes responsible for forming
and catabolizing NAD. As shown in Figure 2E, at the RNA level,
Figure 2. Postpartum Programs the Liver to
Circulate NAD Metabolites
Analysis of liver and blood of lactating dams (n = 5
on NC, n = 5 on NR) at day 14 after parturition
against age-matched control female mice (n = 3)
shows that the postpartum liver increases NAD
synthesis and NAD turnover to mobilize NAD me-
tabolites. Although postpartum alone is sufficient
to drive liver NAD+ down and blood NAD metab-
olites up, NR supplementation leads to recovery
of liver NAD+ and superinduction of blood NAD
metabolites. Gray plungers denote nonlactating
females, white plungers denote lactating dams,
and black plungers denote lactating dams sup-
plemented with NR.
(A) Liver NAD+ is depressed in postpartum but is
increased by NR supplementation with respect to
liver NAD+ in age-matched females.
(B–D) Liver NAAD (B), NAM (C), and MeNAM (D) are
increased by oral NR supplementation.
(E) Expression of enzymes involved in NAD syn-
thesis and turnover is increased at day 14 after

most part, the condition of lactation upregulates
gene expression. In the case of NRK1, lactation on
NR upregulates gene expression.

postpartum females increase expression
of NAMPT and NMNAT1, which form
NAD, while they simultaneously increase
expression of SIRT1 and CD73, which
turn over NAD metabolites. For the most
part, the fold-change increase in expres-
sion is a function of the female lactating.
In the cases of NRK1, NMNAT1, and
SIRT1, the addition of NR to the lactating dam’s chow superin-
duces liver NAD biosynthetic and catabolic programs. At the
protein level, NMNAT1 is increased, while NAD-consuming en-
zymes, especially CD38 and PARP1, are highly upregulated in
postpartum liver (Figure 2F). Consistent with a higher rate of syn-
thesis and turnover of NAD in the liver of lactating postpartum
females, circulating NAD metabolites were higher in the blood
of lactating dams than nonlactating females (Figures 2G–2J).
These increases reached statistical significance for blood
NAAD and MeNAM without NR supplementation.
Supplementation of maternal chow with NR boosted blood
NAD+ and NAM by 2-fold and increased levels of blood NAAD
and MeNAM by 10-fold. Thus, during lactation, the liver sacri-
fices levels of NAD+ to increase circulation of NAD metabolites
to other tissues. By virtue of maternal supplementation with
NR, the NAD metabolome can be maintained at levels at or

 greater than levels of a nonlactating female and the circulating
NAD metabolome is superinduced.
NR Superinduces the Pituitary and Mammary Lactation
Programs
PRL is the principal hormone responsible for driving lactation and
plays an important role in driving maternal behaviors (Frantz,
1978). It was previously shown that MeNAM induces expression
of PRL in a pituitary-derived cell line (Kimura et al., 1983). To con-
nect our observation of increased lactation with NR supplementa-
tion, we asked whether NR supplementation increases PRL
expression. As shown in Figure 3A, PRL protein expression is

2-fold induced by NR in the pituitary of
mouse mothers at day 14 after parturition.
Moreover, as shown in Figure 3B, PRL cir-
culation is increased by 6-fold. Plasma es-
trogen, oxytocin, and progesterone were
also tested and showed a tendency for
elevated estrogen in NR-supplemented
mothers (Figures S2A–S2C). As shown in
Figures 3C and 3D, NR supplementation
promotes mammary tissue development.
In addition, the mammary NAD program
is strikingly upregulated by lactation. As
shown in Figures 3E and 3F, compared
with age-matched mammary tissue from
a nonlactating female, lactation induces accumulation of NAD+
and NADP + by 30- and 20-fold, respectively. NAD precursors
such as NMN, NR, and NAM were also highly induced (Figures
3G–3I). In each case, lactation without supplementation induces
the NAD metabolite, while NR supplementation superinduces
the NAD metabolite during lactation. Consistent with enhanced
lactation of NR-supplemented dams and their higher level of
PRL, mammary tissue from NR-supplemented mothers is super-
induced for all biosynthetic programs. Consistent with the
increased protein biosynthetic program required to increase
lactation, as shown in Figures 3J–3M, levels of mTOR, phos-
phor-mTOR, S6 kinase, and phospho-S6 were increased by NR

 supplementation. As shown in Figures 3N and 3O, expression of
genes involved in lactose, whey protein, and lipid synthesis are
also superinduced by NR supplementation. These data provide
a connection between endogenous liver and mammary NAD pro-
gramming and lactation and a means to further increase lactation
by supplementation with NR.
Maternal NR Enhances Juvenile Growth and Glycemic
Control
As schematized in Figure 1A, at 21 days postpartum, offspring
were weaned to group housing with littermates and all offspring
were put on an NC diet. As shown in Figures 4A–4C and Table
S1, weanlings of NR-supplemented mothers are bigger than
those of nonsupplemented mothers with more lean mass and
fat mass. As shown in Table S1 and Figure S3A, weanling brain
weight controlled for body weight also tended to be greater in
the offspring of NR-supplemented mothers. In rats, weanlings
of NR-supplemented mothers tended to be larger and have
more lean mass (Figures S3B and S3C). Table S1 provides p
values for sex-based main differences and for main differences
on the basis of the maternal diet during the nursing and co-hous-
ing period. In addition, Table S1 identifies the assays for which
there was an interaction between offspring sex and maternal diet.
We subjected 21-day-old mice to a 16 h fast to measure their
susceptibility to hypoglycemia. As shown in Figure 4D and as
seen in the preliminary study in which mothers were fed NR dur-
ing pregnancy (Figure S1B), male pups reared by mothers on NC
had an average fasting glucose level of 64 mg/dL, whereas
males from cages with NR-supplemented mothers had a fasting
glucose level of 90 mg/dL. Female pups were resistant to fasting
hypoglycemia. As shown in Table S1, there were highly signifi-
cant main effects of sex and maternal supplementation on resis-
tance to hypoglycemia. To probe the mechanisms by which
maternal NR protects weanlings from hypoglycemia, we raised
another cohort of pregnant females that were split into NR versus
NC on the day of parturition. All pups were weaned into NC ca-
ges on day 21. Mice (22 days of age) were sacrificed after a 16 h
fast, and livers were isolated for analysis of gene expression and
glycogen storage. As shown in Figures 4E and 4F, pups raised by
NR-supplemented mothers store >2-fold more glycogen in their
livers and tend to have higher RNA expression of phosphoenol-
pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the rate-limiting enzyme for
hepatic gluconeogenesis. As shown in Table S1, by two-way
ANOVA, the higher weanling body mass, lean mass, fat mass,
glycemic control, and glycogen storage measurements all had
maternal supplementation as a statistically significant main ef-
fect independent of sex. Glycogen storage was the only assay
for which there was a statistically significant effect of sex inde-
pendent of maternal supplementation. Thus, maternal NR not
only increases lactation but also allows mothers to produce
larger and more physically resilient weanlings.
Maternal NR Enhances Juvenile Learning and Synaptic
Pruning
We initially noticed that 2-week-old pups of NR-supplemented
mothers were more active in their cages and upon handling. To

p values for effects of maternal supplementation
on each sex are provided in Table S1.
(A) Offspring of NR-supplemented mothers are
larger at weaning (n = 25 males from NC mothers,
22 males from NR mothers, 21 females from NC
mothers, and 31 females from NR mothers). Note
that with 46 pups from NC mothers and 53 pups
from NR mothers, the size advantage cannot be
explained by fewer pups of NR-fed mothers.

greater fat mass at weaning (n = 25 males from NC
mothers, 22 males from NR mothers, 21 females
fromNCmothers,and 31females fromNRmothers).
(C) Offspring of NR-supplemented mothers have
greater lean mass at weaning (n = 25 males from
NC mothers, 22 males from NR mothers, 21
females from NC mothers, and 31 females from
NR mothers).
(D) Fasting blood glucose of mouse pups at day 22 is protected if mothers were NR supplemented (n = 18 male pups of NC mothers, n = 12 male pups of NR-fed
mothers, n = 13 female pups of NC mothers, n = 17 female pups of NR-fed mothers). A Holm-Sidak post hoc multiple-comparisons test is included.
(E) Liver glycogen content is greater if mothers were NR supplemented (n = 6 males from NC mothers, 6 males from NR mothers, 5 females from NC mothers and
6 females from NR mothers).

 quantify this observation, we performed an open field test with
15-day-old mice (Carola et al., 2002). As shown in Figure 5A,
male and female offspring of NR-supplemented mothers were
consistently more mobile, covering substantially more distance,
particularly in the initial two 5 min epochs of observation.
Because mice may increase activity because of changes in
motor ability or anxiety-like behavior (Carola et al., 2002), we
evaluated initial center time as a measure of anxiety and found
no differences (Figure 5B). In addition, when juvenile rats were
assessed with open-field testing on postnatal day 19, they
showed no evidence of altered anxiety-like behavior as a func-
tion of maternal diet.
Juvenile rats were assessed for motor learning on the rotarod
(Carter et al., 2001) on postnatal days 21 and 22. Overall
performance across trials and performance in trials 3, 6, and 8
was better in offspring of NR-fed mothers (Figure 5C). In
addition, although all animals learned, the offspring of NR-sup-
plemented mothers showed greater learning across all phases
of rotarod training compared with the offspring of NC-fed
mothers (Figure 5D).
To determine whether maternal diet might be responsible for
advanced neuroanatomical development of motor learning cir-
cuitry, we sacrificed some of the weanlings after performance
testing and analyzed the caudate-putamen (CP) in 22-day-old
mice. As shown in Figure 5E, CP volume was smaller in the
offspring of NR-supplemented mothers. Assessing postsynaptic
PSD95 immunostaining, we discovered that in offspring of NR-
supplemented mothers, the area of postsynaptic density puncta
was reduced (Figures 5F and 5G). In addition, colocalization of
presynaptic vGLUT1 with postsynaptic PSD95 revealed a >2-
fold reduction in puncta number in the offspring of NR-supple-
mented mothers versus offspring of NC-fed mothers that nearly

 Figure 6. Maternal NR Produces Lasting Benefits in Adult Offspring Physical Performance, Memory, Resiliency, Anti-anxiety and Body
Composition
Adult mouse and rat offspring that had been weaned into cages with NC were put through a battery of behavioral assays and ultimately sacrificed. The data show
lasting and wide-ranging advantages of being raised by an NR-supplemented mother. Adult offspring of NC-fed (open circles) and NR-supplemented (filled

 reached statistical significance (Figures 5H and 5I). This
advanced pruning is temporally significant because peak levels
of synaptic structures in mouse striatum occur in the first post-
natal week (Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1991). Thus, maternal
NR supplementation enhances juvenile behaviors including lo-
comotor exploration, motor learning, and motor performance,
and advances juvenile synaptic pruning in the CP, which is
apparent at the time of weaning.
Maternal NR Produces Lasting Benefits in Physical
Performance of Adult Offspring
We considered the possibility that the changes we observed in
juvenile liver function, body mass, brain, and behaviors might
translate into more capable and/or resilient adults. After the
21 day maternal postpartum dietary intervention, all mice and
rats were maintained on NC diets for an additional 69–89 days.
A battery of adult behavioral assays was used, including open-
field testing and rotarod endurance, beam walking, elevated plus
maze, and light/dark box testing for mice. We used rotarod trials,
a grip strength test, a forced swim, and the Morris water maze for
rats. Our rats were largely immobile in open-field testing and
declined to perform a beam walk. Rats completed an elevated
plus maze but did not show an effect of maternal NR. For all other
assays, performance data are plotted in Figure 6 as a function of
maternal diet and sex, and two-way ANOVA significance data
are provided in Table S1. In brief, maternal NR provided signifi-
cant advantages for both sexes in all the adult behavioral and
body composition assays of Figure 6. Sex was an additional
main effect only in the case of Morris water maze platform entries
(females had better spatial memory) and body composition
(males are bigger with more lean mass, while females have
bigger brains normalized to body weight).
As shown in Figure 6A, the open-field distance explored
of adult (70-day-old) mouse offspring of NR-supplemented
mothers was twice as great across all epochs observed. Simi-
larly, as shown in Figure 6B, adult offspring of NR-supplemented
mothers moved twice as quickly as offspring of NC-fed mothers
(p < 0.001). To test whether adult offspring of NR-supplemented
mothers would also show increased motor endurance compared
with the offspring of NC-fed mothers, we measured the rotarod
endurance of 85-day-old mice. As shown in Figure 6C, the
21 day intervention to postpartum mothers predisposes their
adult offspring to superior rotarod endurance independent
of sex.

for effects of maternal supplementation on each sex are provided in Table S1.
(A) Open-field activity of 70-day-old mouse adults was measured in three 5 min epochs. Adult offspring of NR-fed mothers are more active (n = 5 males from NC
mothers, 8 males from NR mothers, 6 females from NC mothers, and 9 females from NR mothers).
(B) Average speed of adult offspring of NR-fed mothers is significantly greater in the open-field assay (n = 5 males from NC mothers, 8 males from NR mothers,
6 females from NC mothers, and 10 females from NR mothers).
(C) At 85 days of age, adult offspring of NR-fed mothers have advantages in rotarod endurance (n = 9 males from NC mothers, 9 males from NR mothers,
10 females from NC mothers, and 12 females from NR mothers).
(D) At 77 and 78 days of age, adult offspring of NR-fed mothers have superior overall rotarod performance and outperformed on their second, third, and fifth trials
(n = 14 males from NC mothers, 12 males from NR mothers, 8 females from NC mothers, and 10 females from NR mothers).
(E and F) After four training trials on day 1 (E) and four training trials on day 2 (F), adult offspring of NR-fed mothers have superior rotarod endurance compared with
the endurance of adult offspring of NC-fed mothers (n = 14 males from NC mothers, 12 males from NR mothers, 8 females from NC mothers, and 10 females from
NR mothers).
(G) At 76 days of age, adult rat offspring of NR-fed mothers have greater forelimb grip strength than offspring of NC-fed mothers (n = 14 males from NC mothers,
12 males from NR mothers, 8 females from NC mothers, and 10 females from NR mothers).
(H–J) At 86 days of age, adult mice were subjected to a beam walking assay. After one training run, in which offspring of NR-supplemented mothers outperformed
offspring of NC-fed mothers (Figure S4A), male (blue) and female (red) offspring of NR-fed mothers (filled) outperformed the offspring of NC-fed mothers (open) in
faster crossing times (H), fewer foot slips (I), and fewer tail grips (J) (n = 5 male offspring of NC-fed mothers, n = 8 male offspring of NR-fed mothers, n = 6 female
offspring of NC-fed mothers, and n = 10 female offspring of NR-fed mothers). See Video S1 for representative beam crosses.
(K) At 70 days of age, the adult offspring of NR-fed mothers spend significantly more time in light in a light/dark box, consistent with an advantage in anti-anxiety
(n = 5 male offspring of NC-fed mothers, n = 8 male offspring of NR-fed mothers, n = 6 female offspring of NC-fed mothers, and n = 10 female offspring of NR-fed
mothers).
(L) At 85 days of age, adult mice were tested in an elevated plus maze. As judged by increased head distance traveled on the open arm, the adult offspring of NR-
supplemented mothers are less anxious than control adults (n = 5 male offspring of NC-fed mothers, n = 8 male offspring of NR-fed mothers, n = 6 female offspring
of NC-fed mothers, and n = 10 female offspring of NR-fed mothers).
(M and N) At 82 days of age, adult rats were subjected to a forced swim assay. As judged by lower times immobile (M) and greater latency to first immobility (N), the
adult offspring of NR-supplemented mothers are more resilient to this challenge (n = 14 male offspring of NC-fed mothers, n = 12 male offspring of NR-fed
mothers, n = 8 female offspring of NC-fed mothers, and n = 10 female offspring of NR-fed mothers).
(O and P) At 81 days of age, adult rats were subjected to 12 training trials in a Morris water maze to learn the placement of a platform. Offspring of NR-sup-
plemented mothers had more rapid times to the platform across these trials (Figure S4B). In the 13th, in which the platform was removed, the adult offspring of
NR-supplemented mothers have a strong advantage in platform entries (O) and platform quadrant time (P), indicating superior spatial memory (n = 14 male
offspring of NC-fed mothers, n = 12 male offspring of NR-fed mothers, n = 8 female offspring of NC-fed mothers, and n = 10 female offspring of NR-fed mothers).
(Q–S) At 90 days of age, mice were analyze for body composition and sacrificed. Adult offspring of NR-supplemented mothers have lower body weight (Q) and fat
mass (R) and have a larger brain (S) as a proportion of body weight than adult offspring of NC-fed mothers (n = 5 male offspring of NC-fed mothers, n = 8 male
offspring of NR-supplemented mothers, n = 6 female offspring of NC-fed mothers, and n = 10 female offspring of NR-fed mothers).

 The rotarod advantages of adult offspring of NR-supple-
mented mice were directly recapitulated in rats. As shown in
Figure 6D, in 77-day-old rats (nearly 2 months after the end of
the maternal nutritional intervention), the offspring of NR-supple-
mented mothers showed enhanced motor performance on the
rotarod. Additionally, we found that learning occurred faster
with respect to offspring of nonsupplemented mothers (signifi-
cantly increased latency to fall in the second, third, and fifth
trials). In addition to the four daily learning trials, each rat was
probed on the first and second day for maximal rotarod endur-
ance. As shown in Figures 6E and 6F, endurance on the rotarod
was strikingly increased for the offspring of NR-supplemented
mothers on both days independent of sex (p < 0.001).
Rotarod navigation is a complex task involving strength and
balance. We used our 76-day-old rats to test grip strength
(Meyer et al., 1979) and our 86-day-old mice to test balance in
a beam walking test (Carter et al., 2001). As shown in Figure 6G,
having been nursed by an NR-supplemented mother conferred
greater grip strength to adults (p < 0.01). Male and female
offspring of NR-supplemented mothers were subjected to a
training run on a 6 mm wide 3 1 m beam (Figure S4A) and
were videotaped on a second trial. As shown in Figures 6H–6J
and Video S1, offspring that had been nursed by NR-supple-
mented mothers had profoundly superior beam walking skills.
Whereas control adults crossed the beam in 9.5 s with an
average of 5.4 foot slips and 2.2 tail grips, the adult offspring
of supplemented mothers crossed the beam in 6.6 s with an
average of 1.1 foot slip and almost no observed tail grips. These
long-term advantages of maternal NR-supplementation were
highly statistically significant for the physical performance of
adult offspring independent of sex (p < 0.0001 for fewer foot slips
and tail grips).
Maternal NR Produces Adult Offspring that Exhibit
Decreased Anxiety-like and Depressive Behaviors
As nursing pups, the offspring of NR-supplemented mice are
more active in exploring an open field. To determine whether
offspring of NR-supplemented mothers develop into adults
with greater capacity for exploration and resiliency than control
adults, we subjected 70-day-old mice to a light/dark box test
(Bourin and Hascoe
¨ t, 2003), 85-day-old mice to an elevated
plus maze (Carola et al., 2002), and 82-day-old rats to a forced
swim (Slattery and Cryan, 2012).
As shown in Figures 6K and 6L, adult murine offspring of NR-
supplemented mothers exhibited substantially less anxiety-like
behavior than control adults (Table S1) with statistically signifi-
cantly greater willingness to explore light and put their heads
out on the open arm of a plus sign-shaped maze.
In the forced swim test of adult rats (Figures 6M and 6N), the
mothers’ NR supplementation during the nursing period dramat-
ically reduced behavioral immobility in adult offspring assayed
more than 2 months after weaning. Whereas control adults
average 220 s of immobility after an average latency period of
64 s, the offspring of NR-supplemented mothers average only
177 s of immobility after a 92 s latency. These differences,
typically interpreted as a lack of depressive behavior (Slattery
and Cryan, 2012), were significant at p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01,
respectively, across all offspring (Table S1).
Maternal NR Results in Adult Offspring with Superior
Spatial Learning
We used 81-day-old rats in a Morris water maze to assess spatial
learning and memory. As shown in Figure S4C, offspring of con-
trol and NR-supplemented mothers readily learn to swim more
quickly to the platform, lowering their times from 33.4 s in the first
trial to 8.7 s in the 12th trial with the offspring of NR-fed mothers
showing overall superior performance. When the platform was
removed for the 13th/probe trial, offspring of NR-supplemented
mothers made more platform entries (Figure 6O; p < 0.0001
for both sexes) and spent more time in the platform quadrant
(Figure 6P; p < 0.01 for both sexes), indicating that mothers’
postgestational micronutrition confers greater spatial memory
to adult offspring (Table S1).
Maternal NR Results in Adult Offspring with Lower Body
Fat and Higher Brain Mass
At weaning, mice nursed by NR-supplemented mothers are
bigger than those of NC-fed mothers, carrying greater body fat
and lean mass. Whereas increased weight at weaning might
be protective, rodents with greater access to milk prior to
weaning have been shown to be at greater risk for inflammatory
conditions and metabolic dysfunction as adults (Habbout et al.,
2013). At 90 days of age, mice were analyzed for body composi-
tion by MRI and then sacrificed. As shown in Figures 6Q and 6R,
offspring of NR-supplemented mothers are smaller with lower
body fat and, as shown in Figure S4C, the same lean mass as
offspring of NC-fed mothers. Finally, the weight of adult brains
as a proportion of body weight is greater in the adult offspring
of NR-supplemented mothers (Figure 6S).
NR-Supplemented Mothers Exhibit Enhanced Nursing
Behavior
We aimed to identify the mechanisms responsible for the lasting
effects of maternal NR on physical and neurobehavioral func-
tions of rodent adults. Maternal care is known to provide lasting
neurodevelopmental benefits (Caldji et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2000).
To quantify maternal care, we trained a blinded investigator to
recognize arched-back nursing, licking/grooming, and other
behaviors in a set of 1 h recordings of home cage activity taken
on days 11 and 15 post-parturition. Recordings were taken from
9–10 a.m. and 6–7 p.m. on both days to sample maternal
behavior in the early resting and early waking periods, respec-
tively (Jensen Pen
˜ a and Champagne, 2013). Our morning and
evening data were not different and were therefore summed to
produce 2 h observations on each of 2 days for n = 6 rat mothers
in each group. As shown in Figure 7A, rat mothers eating NR-
supplemented food spend 35% more time in arched-back
nursing (p = 0.025) and tend to spend increased time licking
and grooming offspring (Figure S5A), thereby conferring not
only increased nutrition but the potential for care-based pro-
gramming for neurodevelopmental advantages in anti-anxiety
(Caldji et al., 1998) and spatial learning (Liu et al., 2000). We
noticed that whereas all six mothers exhibited an elevated time
of arched-back nursing (Figure 7A), three mothers exhibited
high licking/grooming activity, while three did not (Figure S5A).
Because high licking/grooming have been linked to improved
neurodevelopment (Champagne et al., 2008; Champagne and

 Figure 7. NR Increases Maternal Nursing Behavior and Mammary BDNF Expression into Milk and Produces Adult Offspring with Greater
Hippocampal Neurogenesis
(A) At day 15 post-parturition, rat mothers supplemented with NR spend more time in arched-back nursing (n = 6 mothers fed NC and n = 5 mothers supplemented
with NR).
(B and C) Western analysis (B) and quantification (C) of mammary of mouse mothers at day 14 post-parturition shows that NR-supplementation increases
expression of BDNF (n = 3 in each group).
(D) ELISA analysis of BDNF concentration in day 14 mouse milk shows that NR-supplementation increases BDNF deposition into milk (n = 8 in each group).
(E) In a blinded study, 12-week-old female rats were mated and, upon parturition, assigned to be fed NC, NR, or NC + 0.1 g domperidone/kg of NC. At a dose of
domperidone that produced the same increase in lactation as NR, the mammary expression (14 days after parturition) of BDNF by qPCR is 4-fold greater in NR-
supplemented mothers than in NC-fed mothers. In contrast, domperidone does not elevate expression of BDNF (n = 6 fed NC, n = 5 fed NR, and n = 4 fed
domperidone).
(F and G) At 14 days of age, male mouse pups were sacrificed, and the extracted hindbrain was probed for BDNF by western (F). BDNF protein, quantified after
normalization to tubulin (G), normalized to tubulin, is more abundant in the offspring of NR-supplemented mothers (n = 4).

 Meaney, 2006), we looked for correlations between maternal
licking/grooming with enhanced adult behaviors. As shown in
Figures S5B–S5I, high licking/grooming mothers did not pro-
duce adult offspring with learning, physical or neurobehavioral
advantages with respect to the offspring of low licking/grooming
mothers, suggesting the existence of bioactive factor(s) in the
milk of NR-supplemented mothers responsible for transgenera-
tion developmental programming.
NR-Supplemented Mothers but Not Domperidone-
Treated Mothers Increase Expression of BDNF into Milk
The greater size at weaning of offspring of NR-supplemented
mothers, the increased lactation of NR-supplemented mothers,
and the increased weight loss of NR-supplemented mothers
clearly indicate that offspring of NR-supplemented mothers
obtain more macronutrients than control offspring. Although
increased milk quantity is easy to link to enhanced protection
against hypoglycemia in weanlings, greater access to milk has
been linked to long-lasting cardiovascular and physical perfor-
mance deficits (Habbout et al., 2013) rather than the physical
performance advantages and improved adult body composition
observed in this study. We therefore hypothesized that the
advanced neuroanatomical and neurobehavioral development
is driven by specific bioactive factors. BDNF, which plays critical
roles in neurodevelopment and protection from anxiety and
depression (Egan et al., 2003; Huang and Reichardt, 2001; Mar-
tinowich et al., 2007), has been reported to be present in human
milk and proposed to be among the bioactive factors that confer
the developmental benefits of lactation (Li et al., 2011). As shown
in Figures 7B–7D, in comparison with tissue and milk from NC-
fed mothers, mammary tissue from NR-supplemented mothers
at 14 days after parturition expresses a higher level of BDNF pro-
tein and day 14 milk from NR-supplemented mothers has a
higher level of BDNF.
To test whether enhanced BDNF was simply a bystander
effect of increased lactation, we performed a blinded experi-
ment with 12 new rat mothers that were randomized to NC,
NR-supplemented chow, or chow supplemented with dom-
peridone at 0.1 g/kg of NC. Domperidone is a dopamine D2
receptor antagonist, which is used in some parts of the world
as a prescription drug to increase lactation (Paul et al., 2015).
As shown in Figures S5J and 7E, at a dose of domperidone
that functioned as an equal galactagogue to NR, maternal
NR elevates mammary expression of proBDNF, whereas dom-
peridone does not.
Nursing Offspring of NR-Supplemented Mothers Have
Higher BDNF
BDNF in the hindbrain has been shown to play a role in promot-
ing appetite suppression, locomotor activity, and resistance to
weight gain (Noble et al., 2011), making it an attractive potential
mediator of the beneficial effects of maternal NR supplementa-
tion, particularly because offspring are larger at weaning, more
active, and grow into leaner adults. We sacrificed male 14-
day-old mice and probed for BDNF in the hindbrain. Consistent
with their higher exposure to milk-derived BDNF, as shown in
Figures 7F and 7G, the offspring of NR-supplemented mothers
have consistently higher levels of BDNF in the hindbrain.
Adult Neurogenesis Is Enhanced in Rats Nursed
by NR-Supplemented Mothers
The higher concentration of BDNF in milk and the brains of
nursing offspring could be a casual mechanism for advanced
synaptic pruning and a priming mechanism for enhanced neuro-
behavioral functions of adult offspring of NR-supplemented
mothers. Because of the strong associations between hippo-
campal neurogenesis, learning, and behavioral resilience (Deng
et al., 2010; Masi and Brovedani, 2011), we tested whether
90-day-old rats that differed only in their mother’s diet from their
birth to weaning might differ in their rate of incorporation of bro-
modeoxyuridine (BrdU) into cells that become new neurons of
the dentate gyrus. As shown in Figures 7H–7J, adult hippocam-
pal neurogenesis quantified 3 weeks after 6 days of BrdU injec-
tion was enhanced in male and female adult offspring of NR-sup-
plemented mothers with respect to the offspring of NC-fed
mothers. Thus, NR-supplemented mothers confer long-lasting
neurodevelopmental benefits to their offspring.
DISCUSSION
The common theme that unites models in which NR has pro-
vided efficacy is that the NAD metabolome, particularly levels
of NAD+ and/or NADPH, is dysregulated by particular types of
metabolic stress. Here we investigated postpartum, which is
widely understood to be an episode of major metabolic stress,
for its effect on the NAD metabolome and its potential modula-
tion by NR.
In postpartum, maternal metabolism is programmed for self-
sacrifice with homeorhetic transfer of macronutrients from the
mother to her offspring. We discovered that the postpartum liver
sacrifices levels of NAD+ (Figure 2A) to circulate higher levels of
(H–J) Adult rats (95 days old) were injected with BrdU for 6 consecutive days and were sacrificed 10 days after the last injection. Representative images (H) of adult
rat dentate gyrus and quantification data show that NR supplementation of mothers predisposes adults to greater hippocampal proliferation (I) and neurogenesis
(J) (n = 5 male and 4 female offspring of NC-fed and n = 5 male and 4 female offspring of NR-fed mothers). Scale bars, 100 mM.
(K) In summary, provision of NR to postgestational female rodents increases hepatic NAD synthesis and systemic circulation of the NAD metabolome and
stimulates PRL production by the pituitary. The lactation program greatly induces mammary NAD synthesis and mammary macronutrient biosynthetic programs,
but mammary NAD and macronutrient synthesis are further induced by oral NR. NR-fed mothers increase arched-back nursing behavior and mammary pro-
duction of BDNF, which is transmitted to milk. Juvenile offspring are larger at weaning, are more mobile, learn faster, and have advanced pruning in the CP. Adult
offspring of NR-supplemented mothers have enhanced physical prowess, motor learning, and spatial memory and test as less anxious and more resistant to
behavioral immobility than control adults. Finally, the adult offspring of NR-supplemented mothers are advantaged in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

 NAD metabolites systemically (Figures 2I and 2J). One of the pri-
mary circulating NAD metabolites is formed by N-methylation of
NAM (Trammell et al., 2016a). MeNAM has been previously
shown to activate transcription of PRL in pituitary cells (Kimura
et al., 1983). We found that MeNAM is increased during post-
partum and is superinduced by maternal NR supplementation.
As shown in Figures 3E and 3F, we discovered that NAD+ and
NADP+ are more than 20-fold increased in the lactating mam-
mary without NR supplementation. With export of NAD metabo-
lites from the liver, there are increased NAD metabolites in circu-
lation, resulting in a huge induction of the mammary NAD
program. The postpartum drop in liver NAD can be more than
corrected by NR supplementation, which in turn superinduces
blood circulation of NAD metabolites and mammary increases
in the NAD metabolome. The >20-fold induction of mammary
NAD+ and NADP+ constitutes a remarkable development-medi-
ated expansion of the NAD metabolome, which appears to be
linked to the expanded biosynthetic capacity of the lactating
mammary.
As schematized in Figure 7K, enhanced PRL expression is
postulated to be a key driver of all of the reported phenotypes.
By circulation more PRL, mammary biosynthetic programs are
increased, and there would be an obligately greater homeo-
rhetic transfer of calories to offspring (Bauman and Currie,
1980; Frantz, 1978). In addition, with greater milk production,
maternal behavior would tend to increase. However, by culling
litters in mice and rats, one can produce offspring that are
overfed; such rodents have defective hypothalamic program-
ming as well as impaired glucose tolerance and renal and car-
diovascular function (Habbout et al., 2013). Thus, simply
increasing milk quantity without an increase in milk quality
cannot account for the physical performance differences
observed here.
Because NR is found in milk and is stable in milk (Bieganow-
ski and Brenner, 2004; Trammell et al., 2016c), it was straight-
forward to test whether maternal NR results in greater trans-
mission of NR or other NAD metabolites to offspring. Though
NAM and NR are transmitted at higher levels by NR-supple-
mented mothers, the mother’s oral NR is not directly trans-
mitted to her milk. Given the complexity of milk, we postulated
that milk from NR-supplemented mothers might be enhanced
in bioactive components. Earlier, lactoferrin was found to
confer a higher degree of BDNF expression in neonatal hippo-
campus (Chen et al., 2015), and time the mother invests in
arched-back nursing was linked to higher neonatal expression
of BDNF (Liu et al., 2000). BDNF is one of many compact,
disulfide-linked growth factors thought to be orally available
to target tissues through the neonatal digestive system (Play-
ford et al., 2000). Our data establish that NR-supplemented
mothers
express
more
BDNF
than
control
mothers
and
mothers whose milk production was increased by administra-
tion of domperidone. We further show that offspring sacrificed
at the peak of milk production have higher levels of BDNF in
their hindbrains. The powerful effects of BDNF on development,
learning, and protection against psychological imbalances are
well known (Egan et al., 2003; Huang and Reichardt, 2001;
Huang et al., 1999; Martinowich et al., 2007). Because NR
but not domperidone increased mammary BDNF expression,
this bioactive factor is specifically linked to increased NAD
metabolism during postpartum.
As schematized in Figure 7G, the nature of the physical and
behavioral advantages we observed are striking when one con-
siders their breadth. In the wild, neonates and juveniles are
vulnerable to starvation; maternal NR provides advantages in
size and protection from hypoglycemia to weaned pups. We
further documented lasting advantages in learning, strength,
balance, resistance to conditions that make rodents anxious,
and resistance to behavioral immobility, which has been
interpreted as despair or depression. Whereas mice raised by
NR-supplemented mothers had greater lean and fat mass at
weaning, as 90-day-old adults, the same animals had less fat
while preserving their lean mass.
Though pregnancy-associated niacin deficiency is reportedly
common (Baker et al., 2002) and B3 supplementation during
pregnancy could potentially be used to prevent birth defects
(Shi et al., 2017), it is striking that an increase in NAD metabolism
strictly during the postpartum period was sufficient for increased
lactation, increased production of BDNF, and long-lasting neu-
rodevelopmental benefits. Thus, this work creates the potential
for NR to emerge as a safe and effective galactagogue that
may also promote human childhood development.
Future studies will determine whether gestational NR protects
offspring against the maternal effects of obesity, probe the
means by which PRL expression is induced by NR, and deter-
mine the set of transmissible factors, and the developmental
roles of these factors, that are coordinately induced in the NR-
supplemented mammary. These factors and their modulation
by dietary NR have the potential to explain some of the benefits
of breastfeeding. In addition, the work suggests avenues for clin-
ical investigation that would probe whether NR will increase
lactation and/or weight loss in postpartum women, the degree
to which NR may increase transmission of BDNF or other
bioactive components into human milk, and whether maternal
NR supplementation may improve human childhood and adult
development.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
All animal experiments were done according to procedures approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Rodents were housed in a temperature-controlled facility with 12 hour day/light cycles and ad libitim access to food
and water. Parental mice (C57BL6/NJ) were bred at 18-weeks old in the experiments of Figure S1. Parental mice were bred at
12-weeks old in all other experiments. The mouse strain was C57BL6/NJ except in Figure 2, Figure 3A, 3D-O and Figure 7F-G, which
employed C57BL6/J mice. Parental rats (Fisher 344) were bred at 9-weeks old. Mothers were analyzed at parturition and on indicated
days post-parturition. Offspring were analyzed at indicated ages.
METHOD DETAILS
NAD metabolomics
Quantitative targeted NAD metabolomics was as previously described (Trammell and Brenner, 2013; Trammell et al., 2016a; Tram-
mell et al., 2016c).
Physiological characterization
Mammary tissue was dissected, mounted and stained as described (Plante et al., 2011). Body composition of mice and rats was
determined using Bruker Minispec LF90 and LF-90II.
Total RNA was isolated from tissues using TRIzol and further purified using column purification (Omega Biotek EZNA Total RNA Kit
I). cDNA was synthesized using 1-2 mg of total RNA using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix or qScript (Quantabio). Quantitative
PCR was done using the BioRad CFX96 Touch system with SYBR Green mix (BioRad). SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis was
performed by separating proteins in 4%–20% gels (Invitrogen), were transferred to PVDF membranes, incubation with respective
antibodies, and detected with Clarity Western ECL Blotting Substrate (BioRad).
Milk was collected in lactating mice (n = 8) in each of two groups and rats (n = 6) in each of two groups on days 7, 14 and 21 post-
parturition. In the domperidone study, comparison study, there were n = 6 rats on NC, n = 5 rats on NR and n = 4 rats on NC plus

 domperidone. Before collection, dams and pups were separated for a period of 4 hours. Dams were anesthetized using isoflurane
and injected with oxytocin at 2 IU/kg (mice) or 4 IU/kg (rats). Milk was collected by manual expression for 15 min and stored at �80�C
after measuring volumes. Double-labeled NR, which incorporates a deuterated ribose and 13C NAM moeity (Ratajczak et al., 2016),
was gavaged at a dose of 185 mg/kg to lactating mice to determine whether oral NR is transmitted intact into milk. Milk was collected
at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours after gavage from individual mice.
Total carbohydrate in mouse and rat milk was determined by colorimetric assay (K645 BioVision). Total protein was determined
using the bicinchoninic assay and milk fat was determined as described (Forcato et al., 2005). For assays of macronutrients, there
were n = 4 mice in each group and n = 6 rats. Mouse milk BDNF was determined by ELISA (OKEH00022, Aviva Systems Biology) with
n = 8 in each group.
Mouse blood glucose was measured after 16-hour fasts with blood from tail tips. Glycogen from snap-frozen liver tissue was deter-
mined with kit 700480 from Cayman.
Neuroanatomical characterization
To characterize CP volume and PSD95 staining, mouse offspring of NC-fed (n = 8) and NR-fed (n = 8) mothers at postnatal day 22 and
90 were euthanized by decapitation. Brains were removed, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr, and stored in 20% sucrose/
PBS. Brains were frozen in OCT, cryosectioned (50 mm), and stored in vials with PBS plus 2% sodium azide at 4�C until processing for
immunohistochemistry. Free-floating brain sections were treated with blocking solution of 0.2% triton, 0.1% tween and 10% horse
serum after which they were stained with PSD-95 (1:200) and vGlut1 primary antibodies (1:1000) overnight and secondary rabbit 488
and mouse 594 antibodies (1:500). Sections were mounted on slides and coverslipped with DAPI for nuclear staining. PSD95+ puntal
area and PSD95+/vGlut1+ colocalized puncta number were evaluated with two 63x z stack maximum projection Apotome images
(3 planes within 1 micron section thickness) within the CP from two sections per brain taken with equivalent light, exposure, and gain
across samples using StereoInvestigator software (Microbrightfield, Colchester, VT) coupled to a Zeiss AxioImager 2 Mot Plus (Carl
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a digital camera and motorized stage controller. Equivalently thresholded images were evaluated
for total area of PSD95 puncta and double labeled (PSD95/vGlut1) synapse number using ImageJ with the Puncta Analyzer v2.0
plugin.
90 day-old Fisher 344 offspring of NC-fed and NR-fed mothers were injected intraperitoneally six times with BrdU (100 mg/kg once
every 24 hr and were euthanized 10 days after the last injection. There were n = 9 per group including 5 males and 4 females. After an
anesthetic overdose of 100 mg/ml ketamine and 10 mg/ml xylazene, all animals were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformal-
dehyde. Brains were processed, cryosectioned, stored and blocked as above. Sections were stained with NeuN (1:500) primary
and secondary rabbit 594 (1:500) antibodies, again fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then treated with 1.5 M HCl at 37�C for
1.5 hours for antigen unmasking. After washing in PBS, sections were treated with a BrdU primary antibody (1:100) overnight and
then a secondary 488 antibody (1:500) for one hour, mounted on slides, and coverslipped with DAPI for nuclear staining.
An average of 12 pairs of sections from each brain (n = 9) in each group were used to count the number of BrdU-positive nuclei
in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus. A subset of these (n = 4 per group) were then also assessed for BrdU co-labeling
with NeuN to determine neuronal identity. All cells contained in the pre-defined dentate gyrus region were counted using Stereoin-
vestigator software.
Behavioral characterization
Maternal behavior was recorded in home cages in rats (n = 6) in each group on days 11 and day 15 after parturition. The behavior of
each dam was video recorded for two 60-minute observation periods on each day. Within each 60-min observation period, the
behavior of each mother was scored every 5 min for arched back nursing, licking, grooming, eating, self-grooming and nest-making
by a blinded investigator.
Open field activity was assessed using Anymaze software with an overhead camera. The set-up allowed the simultaneous tracking
of two rats or four mice, using separate square observation arenas (100 cm length x 100 cm width x 30 cm height) for rats and (50 cm
length x 30 cm width x 30 cm height) for mice. At the beginning of the trial, the subject was placed in the center of the arena. Spon-
taneous activity was measured over a 30-minute period for rats or a 15-minute period for mice.
Grip strength was measured by tension force using a Columbus instruments 1027DR.
The sum of six consecutive trials was taken as an index of forelimb grip strength.
Rotarod accelerating and endurance was tested with Panlab Harvard apparatus model number LE8305 at acceleration rate 30 s to
10 minutes with 1 s increments. All rats were tested for 8 trials with 4 trials on day 1 and 4 trials on day 2. Mice were trained for rotarod
endurance on two successive days and tested for endurance on day 3.
The elevated plus maze is made of medium-density fiberboard with a matte black acrylic surface and consists of four arms (two
open without walls and two enclosed by 16 cm high wall in mice). Both open and closed arms were 25 cm long and 5 cm wide in mice.
Behavior was videotaped using an overhead camera and tracked using Anymaze software for five min.
The Morris water maze consist of a pool 150 cm in diameter and 50 cm in height divided into 4 quadrants. The pool was filled with
water at a temperature of 25 ± 1�C, and a square platform (diameter = 10 cm) was positioned 1.5 cm below the water surface in the
platform quadrant. During training trials, each rat had to escape the water by climbing onto the square platform, which was not visible
to the rat. The time to locate the platform was recorded. If the rat failed to locate the platform within 60 s, the trial was terminated and
e3

 the unsuccessful rat was guided onto the platform. All the rats were allowed to remain on the platform for 20 s. After a final 12th
training trial on same day, the rats were subjected to a probe trial (60 s) in the maze without the presence of a platform. Anymaze
tracking system with overhead camera was used to videotape the behavior.
The forced swim test consisted of individually placing the rats into a cylindrical tank (transparent acrylic, 60 cm height 3 20 cm
diameter) containing clean water at 25�C (25 cm deep). They were allowed to swim in the tank for 6 minutes and the behavior
was videotaped and analyzed later by an investigator who was blinded to groups.
Aversion to well-lit spaces was tested using a box made of two compartments one-third dark and two-third light with an exterior
size 46 3 27 3 30 cm. Behavior was videotaped using an overhead camera and time spent and distance covered in light or dark was
analyzed using Anymaze software.
The beam walking apparatus consisted of a 1-m beam of 6 mm width resting 50 cm above the table top on two poles. A black box is
placed at the end of the beam as the finish point. Time taken to cross the beam and number of paw slips were later analyzed using
videos by the investigator who was blinded to the groups.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
In the experimental design of Figure S1A, mothers were randomly assigned to four different diets. In the experimental design of Fig-
ure 1A, after the first two mothers had litters and were alternately assigned to NC or NR, subsequent mothers were assigned to a diet
in order to equalize the initial post-gestational body weight. Data are presented as individuals with means or as means ± SEM and
statistical significance was performed using Student’s t test, repeated-measures analysis of variance, and two-way ANOVA was
used to identify significance of main effects. The effect of maternal NR within sex groups was determined by the Holm Sidak
approach. All analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism using the false discovery rate-based ROUT method to identify outliers.
P values of p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001, and p < 0.0001 are indicated as *, **, ***, and ****, respectively. Number of individuals analyzed
and statistical details are provided in figure legends.
