STUDY QUESTION: What are the reproductive experiences of women who cryopreserve oocytes for non-medical reasons?
SUMMARY ANSWER: One in three women had been pregnant at some stage in their lives and while most still wanted to have a child or
another child, very few had used their stored oocytes, predominantly because they did not want to be single parents.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The number of healthy women who freeze oocytes to avoid age-related infertility is increasing. Evidence
about reproductive outcomes after oocyte cryopreservation for non-medical reasons is needed to help women make informed decisions.
STUDY DESIGN SIZE, DURATION: A cross-sectional survey was carried out. Study packs which included a self-administered question-
naire were mailed by clinic staff to 193 eligible women.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women who had stored oocytes for non-medical reasons at Melbourne IVF,
a private ART clinic, between 1999 and 2014 were identified from medical records and invited to complete an anonymous questionnaire
about their reproductive histories and experience of oocyte cryopreservation.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 10 survey packs were returned to the clinic marked ‘address unknown’. Of
the 183 potential respondents, 96 (53%) returned the questionnaire. One respondent provided only free-text comments, thus data from 95
respondents were compiled. The mean age at the time of freezing oocytes was 37.1 years (SD ± 2.6, range: 27–42) and the average number
of oocytes stored was 14.2 (SD ± 7.9, range: 0–42); 2% had attempted to store oocytes but had none suitable for freezing, 24% had stored
<8 oocytes, 35% had 8–15, 25% had 16–23 and 14% had stored >23 oocytes. About one-third of respondents (34%) had been pregnant at
some point in their lives. Six women (6%) had used their stored oocytes and three of them had given birth as a result. The main reason for
not using stored oocytes was not wanting to be a single parent. Of the 87 (91%) women who still had oocytes stored, 21% intended to use
them while 69% indicated that their circumstances would determine usage. The mean number of children respondents would ideally have
liked to have was significantly higher than the number of children they expected to have (2.11 versus 1.38, P < 0.001).
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The limitations are inherent to any anonymously completed questionnaire: participation
bias, missing data and the possibility that some questions or response alternatives may have been ambiguous.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings add to the very limited evidence about the reproductive outcomes experi-
enced by women who freeze oocytes for non-medical reasons and can be used to help women make informed decisions about whether to
store oocytes.

Introduction
Oocyte freezing has been available for several decades to preserve fer-
tility in women about to undergo cytotoxic treatment likely to reduce
their fertility (Argyle et al., 2016). In the initial experimental phase of
oocyte freezing, oocyte survival rates were low. As cryopreservation
techniques have been refined, ART procedures incorporating frozen
oocytes demonstrate a similar potential to result in a live birth as those
incorporating fresh oocytes (Argyle et al., 2016). In oocyte donation
programmes, where most oocytes come from young and healthy
women, high rates of successful pregnancies are reported for vitrified
warmed oocytes (Cobo et al., 2015). With improved efficiency, the
application of oocyte cryopreservation has been extended as an ‘insur-
ance’ against age-related fertility decline; increasing numbers of healthy
women now freeze their eggs to mitigate age-related infertility
(Domingo et al., 2016). Data from surveys show that most Swedish
women aged 30–39 years have a positive attitude towards oocyte
cryopreservation for non-medical reasons (Wennberg et al., 2016);
about one in three women of reproductive age in Belgium would con-
sider oocyte cryopreservation to extend their reproductive life (Stoop
et al., 2011) and among 257 childless women aged 28–35 years who
completed an online survey, the intention to cryopreserve oocytes
was associated with feeling susceptible to infertility, considering oocyte
freezing useful to achieve parenthood, and expecting to have children
at a later age (ter Keurst et al., 2016). These data suggest that the prac-
tice of oocyte cryopreservation for non-medical reasons is likely to
become more common. Since 2014 large companies, such as Apple
and Facebook, have covered the cost of oocyte cryopreservation for
their female employees. It has been argued (Baylis, 2015) that this is
not an altruistic gesture, but most likely for the commercial benefit of
not having childbearing interrupt the careers of young talented
women. If this practice is taken up by other large companies, it may
contribute to increased uptake of oocyte cryopreservation to avoid
age-related infertility.
Opinions vary about whether and how oocyte cryopreservation for
non-medical reasons may benefit women. Some argue that it adds to
women’s reproductive choices, gives them the opportunity to extend
their reproductive lifespan, allows them more time to find a suitable
partner and fulfil other life goals before having children, decreases the
risk of age-related aneuploidies and foetal loss (Goold and Savulescu,
2009), and, according to a mathematical model, reduces the cost to
obtain a live birth for women who plan to delay childbearing until age
40 years (Devine et al., 2015). Others fear that the availability of fertil-
ity preservation might encourage women to delay childbearing and
that this would result in more women having children beyond the nat-
ural reproductive lifespan with its associated medical risks (Radon
et al., 2015); that, rather than increase women’s reproductive auton-
omy, it may lead to ‘new and different pressures and ethical dilemmas’
(Rebar, 2016) and that women are ‘misled to believe that the repro-
ductive fountain of youth is obtainable by freezing their eggs’
(Schattman, 2016). Some make the case that, rather than encouraging
oocyte cryopreservation to reduce the impact of age-related infertility,
it would be more helpful to introduce family-friendly social policies
that support people to have children during their most fertile years
(Martinelli et al., 2015; Mertes, 2015).
Regardless of opinions on potential risks and benefits, each woman
who considers oocyte cryopreservation needs and deserves compre-
hensive, personalized information about the medical, social, psycho-
logical and financial aspects of the procedure, including estimates of
her chance of having a baby from the frozen oocytes, to avoid raising
false hope and to allow her to make an informed decision about
whether to proceed (ESHRE Task Force on Ethics and Law, 2012).
The likelihood of a birth from frozen oocytes is highly dependent on
the woman’s age at the time of collection and the number of oocytes
stored (Pelin et al., 2013; Cobo et al., 2016; Doyle et al., 2016).
Various models have been proposed to estimate the chance of a birth
from frozen oocytes. Doyle et al. (2016) calculated oocyte efficiency
as the rate of births per oocyte for different age groups and reported it
to be 8.7% in women aged 30–34 years, declining to 4.5% in women
aged 38–40 years and 2.5% in women aged 41–42 years. Cobo et al.
(2016) found the cumulative live birth rate of at least one baby from
eight oocytes to be 41% in women aged 35 years or younger and 20%
in women older than 35 years. Using a model constructed to deter-
mine the success and cost-effectiveness of oocyte preservation in
comparison with no action, Mesen et al. (2015) concluded that the
optimal age for freezing oocytes is 37 years. However, Tsafrir et al.
(2015) recommended freezing oocytes at a younger age, preferably
before 35 years, as their data revealed that one in five women under-
going ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation had a poor response
and that this was related to age.
In Australia and the USA, the cost of freezing oocytes ranges
between US$10 000 and 15 000, excluding the cost of storage and
subsequent IVF treatment for those who return to use their stored
oocytes (Bowden, 2015; Harwood, 2015). Harwood (2009) argued
that, unless women are well-informed about the likely outcomes and
potential risks of the procedure, they are vulnerable to commercial
exploitation. An audit of the quality of information relating to oocyte
cryopreservation for non-medical reasons available on US ART clinic
websites found that most clinics did not meet recommended industry
standards; the authors concluded that the type and quality of informa-
tion provided should be improved (Avraham et al., 2014).
Investigations of the characteristics of women who freeze oocytes
for non-medical reasons have found that, at the time of storage, most
are in their late 30s, socio-economically advantaged, highly educated,
in professional occupations, and, contrary to the stereotype of women
deliberately delaying childbearing to advance their careers, most cite

 the lack of a partner as their main reason for freezing oocytes (Hodes-
Wertz et al., 2013; Vallejo et al., 2013; Baldwin et al., 2015; Stoop
et al., 2015). There is much more limited evidence about the propor-
tions who return to use their stored oocytes, their reasons for not
using them, and reproductive outcomes (from spontaneous and ART-
related pregnancies, including with stored oocytes). There are reports
from three studies on some of these aspects. Interviews with 23
women who had stored oocytes for non-medical reasons revealed
that two had used their stored eggs (one of whom gave birth), two
had given birth after spontaneous conception and two were pregnant
at the time of the interview after conceiving spontaneously (Baldwin
et al., 2015). Stoop et al. (2015) interviewed 86 women who had cryo-
preserved oocytes 1–3 years earlier and found that almost all still
wished for a child but only about half expected to use their stored
oocytes. A survey of 183 women who had cryopreserved oocytes
from 2005 to 2011 found that a third reported being ‘very likely’ to
use their stored oocytes but most (93%) had not returned to use
them (Hodes-Wertz et al., 2013). Of the 20% who reported a suc-
cessful conception in the years following oocyte cryopreservation,
50% resulted from spontaneous conception and 40% from using ‘fresh’
oocytes in an ART cycle. Stored oocytes had been used by only 11
women, of whom three had achieved a pregnancy. Whether or not
these pregnancies resulted in a birth was not reported (Hodes-Wertz
et al., 2013).
To contribute to understanding the reproductive trajectories of
women who store oocytes, including the outcomes from using the
stored oocytes, the aim of this research was to describe the repro-
ductive experiences of women who freeze oocytes for non-medical
reasons.
Materials and Methods
Ethics committee approval
The research was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees
of Monash University (CF14/2224-2014001182) and Melbourne IVF
(30/14-MIVF).
Setting
Melbourne IVF is a large private provider of fertility treatment in Victoria,
Australia. It offers comprehensive fertility services, including fertility preser-
vation for medical and non-medical indications. Oocyte cryopreservation
using the ‘slow freezing’ protocol has been available since the early 1990s;
in the first 10 years, it was mainly offered to preserve fertility before cancer
treatment. Vitrification as the method of freezing oocytes was introduced
in 2012. Women who cryopreserve oocytes for non-medical reasons bear
the full cost of the procedure because it is not subsidized by government
or private health insurance.
Participants
The inclusion criteria were to be a woman who had experienced at least
one stimulated cycle at Melbourne IVF from January 1999 to December
2014 with the aim of collecting oocytes for cryopreservation without a
medical indication.
Data source
A study-specific questionnaire was developed, based on the existing litera-
ture and the collective clinical and research experience of the authors. It
included questions with fixed response options about demographic charac-
teristics and social circumstances: age currently and at the time of oocyte
cryopreservation, relationship status currently and at the time of oocyte
cryopreservation, level of education, occupation and health insurance sta-
tus (an indicator of socio-economic status). Questions about reproductive
experiences were whether or not the woman had been pregnant (yes/
no); timing of any pregnancies (before/after/both before and after storing
oocytes); whether any pregnancies resulted from ART (yes/no); outcomes
of any pregnancies (miscarriage/stillbirth/abortion/birth); year and meth-
od of oocyte freezing (vitrification/‘slow’ freezing/unsure); the number of
stored oocytes; whether stored oocytes had been used (yes/no); reasons
for not using stored oocytes (multiple responses from a list); outcome of
using stored oocytes (eggs did not survive/embryos did not form/no preg-
nancy/pregnancy miscarried/birth); whether oocytes remained in storage
(yes/no); whether the woman planned to use the stored eggs (yes/no/
depends on circumstances); whether she wanted a future child or children
(yes/no); her ideal number of children and how many children she realis-
tically expected to have, considering her circumstances. The questionnaire
also invited free-text comments.
Procedure
Clinic staff identified potential participants from medical records and
mailed a study pack to each woman. The pack contained a personalized
letter of invitation describing the purpose of the study, signed by the clinic’s
medical director; an explanatory statement about the research which
emphasized that participation was voluntary and anonymous; a copy of the
questionnaire and a reply-paid envelope addressed to the research team
that was independent of the clinic. A second package containing a
reminder letter, the explanatory statement, a questionnaire and a reply-
paid envelope was sent to all potential participants 3 weeks later.
Data management and analysis
Data were entered into a password protected secure database and ana-
lysed in SPSS v 20 using descriptive statistics and the Student’s t-test for
comparisons of continuous variables (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A
value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Response rate
Study packs were mailed by clinic staff to 193 eligible women. Ten
packs were returned to the clinic marked ‘address unknown’ and 96 of
183 (53%) questionnaires were returned to the research team. One
respondent provided only free-text comments. Data from 95 respon-
dents are thus available.
Participants’ characteristics

(SD ± 2.6, range: 27–42) and at the time of completing the survey
39.9 years (SD ± 4.2, range: 30–54). When they froze their oocytes
most respondents were single (86%) and almost half (47%) were 38
years or older. As a group, participants were socio-economically
advantaged. Compared to the general population of women in
Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2012a, 2012b, 2013), they
were more likely to be university educated (89 versus 27%), employed
in a professional or managerial occupation (88 versus 37%) and have
private health insurance (93 versus 57%).

 Oocyte cryopreservation and use of stored
oocytes
Two respondents (including the woman who provided only free-text
comments) had no oocytes available for freezing after hormone stimu-
lation. Of those who had stored oocytes, almost half (49%) had stored
them in 2013–2014 when the vitrification freezing method was used.
Of the 91 respondents who completed the question, almost two-
thirds (65%) were unsure which method had been used to freeze their
oocytes, a quarter stated that they had been vitrified (25%) and the
remainder that ‘slow’ freezing had been used (8%) or that both meth-
ods had been used for two separate batches of oocytes (2%). On aver-
age, respondents had stored 14.2 oocytes (SD ± 7.9, range: 0–42);
24% had stored <8 oocytes, 35% had 8–15, 25% had 16–23, 14% had
>23 and 2% did not state the number of oocytes they had stored. Six
women (6%) had used their stored oocytes, three of whom had given
birth as a result. Two of the women who had not achieved a
pregnancy with their stored oocytes subsequently gave birth after
using fresh oocytes in an ART procedure. One women who gave birth
after using her stored oocytes also gave birth to a spontaneously con-
ceived child (Table II).
Reproductive experiences of all respondents
Overall, 32 women (34% of all) had been pregnant at some point in
their lives. Of these, nine (28%) had used ART to conceive. Nineteen
women (20% of all) had been pregnant before they stored eggs,
experiencing a total of 27 pregnancies resulting in 13 miscarriages, 11
induced abortions and 3 births. A total of 21 women (22% of all) had
become pregnant since storing oocytes; between them they had 27
pregnancies resulting in 6 miscarriages, 15 births and 6 current preg-
nancies. The 15 births and 6 ongoing pregnancies resulted from ART
with frozen oocytes (n = 3, as described above), ART with fresh
oocytes (n = 6) and spontaneous conception (n = 12).
Women who had not used their oocytes were asked to choose,
from a list of possible reasons, all the reasons that applied to them;
responses from the 87 women who answered the question are pre-
sented in Table III. The most commonly endorsed reasons were not
wanting to be a single parent, preferring to conceive naturally and not
wanting to use a sperm donor. Reasons related to financial circum-
stances and employment appeared to have played a very minor role.
A total of 87 (91%) respondents still had oocytes stored at the time
of the survey. When asked whether they intended to use the stored
eggs, most (69%) indicated that this would depend on their circum-
stances. Overall, 21% of respondents stated that they intended to use
the eggs, 7% that they did not intend to use them and 3% were
unsure.
Reproductive desires and expectations
When asked about their hopes and expectations relating to childbear-
ing, the majority (85%) of respondents still wanted to have a child or
another child. Respondents’ ideal (if all things were possible) and
expected (considering current circumstances) numbers of children are
presented in Table IV. The average ideal number of children was sig-
nificantly higher than the average expected number of children (2.11
versus 1.38, P < 0.001).
Discussion
This is one of the largest studies, and the first from Australia, of
women who freeze their oocytes for non-medical reasons. The results
add to the limited evidence about the reproductive experiences of this
growing group of women.
The strengths of this research include a comparatively large sample,
a relatively high response rate for an unsolicited survey on a sensitive
topic, and the inclusion of questions about reproductive aspirations
and outcomes on which there is little evidence. The limitations inher-
ent in any survey also apply to this survey: participation bias, missing
data and the possibility that some questions or response alternatives
may have been ambiguous.
Consistent with other evidence about women who cryopreserve
oocytes for non-medical reasons, most respondents were aged in their
late 30s, well educated, socio-economically advantaged and single
(Hodes-Wertz et al., 2013; Baldwin et al., 2015; Stoop et al., 2015).

 Since the considerable cost of fertility preservation for non-medical
reasons is borne by the individual, being financially well-resourced is
likely to be a pre-requisite for oocyte cryopreservation. Although the
increasing age of childbearing observed in most high-income countries
is often framed as a result of women electing to pursue other life goals
before having children, evidence suggests that the main reason for
women having children later in life is the lack of a partner willing to
commit to parenthood (Hammarberg and Clarke, 2005; Holton et al.,
2011). The finding that almost all surveyed women were in their late
30s and single when they froze oocytes could be interpreted to suggest
that they froze their oocytes in hopes of still finding a partner willing to
be a parent. That almost half of the respondents had stored oocytes in
the 2 years preceding the survey may, in part, explain why so few had
used them. Respondents’ reasons for not having used their oocytes
suggest that they were hoping to find a partner with whom they could
have a child. Single parenthood using donated sperm appeared to be a
less preferred option, as others have found (Baldwin et al., 2015).
Almost half of the women surveyed froze their eggs at an age that
may be deemed suboptimal (older than 37 years) (Mesen et al., 2015)
and one quarter had fewer than the 8–10 mature oocytes considered
necessary for a reasonable chance of success (Cobo and Garcia-
Velasco, 2016). Some experts recommend that women should freeze
oocytes when they are young because this will ensure the best chance

Experiences of freezing oocytes for non-medical reasons

 of achieving a pregnancy later in life should they be unable to conceive
spontaneously (Cobo and Garcia-Velasco, 2016). Others, however,
claim that, rather than cryopreserving oocytes at age 25 years, it is
more cost-effective for women who want to conceive at age 40 years
to attempt spontaneous conception and, if unsuccessful, to use ART
with fresh oocytes (Hirshfeld-Cytron et al., 2012). A third position is
that, to optimize outcomes, women who are likely to benefit from
oocyte cryopreservation should be encouraged to freeze their eggs
before age 35 years and fertility clinics should be discouraged ‘from
specifically targeting women who have already surpassed the age at
which good results can be expected’ (Mertes and Pennings, 2011).
While the optimal age for freezing oocytes may be debated, it is
important to know that women who store oocytes for non-medical
reasons also can conceive spontaneously and with ART with ‘fresh’
oocytes. Since storing their oocytes, one in five women in our survey
had given birth or were currently pregnant. Of the 21 viable pregnan-
cies, more than half were from spontaneous conception, more than
one quarter from ART with ‘fresh’ oocytes, and only 3 of 21 resulted
from using stored oocytes. This is similar to the results from Hodes-
Wertz et al. (2013) who reported that, of the 183 women who had
stored oocytes for non-medical reasons, 20% had conceived in subse-
quent years but only in 10% of cases was conception the result of using
their stored oocytes. The remainder had conceived spontaneously or
by using ‘fresh’ oocytes in an ART cycle.
There were varied reproductive trajectories reported by the sur-
veyed women: never having been pregnant, conceiving spontaneously
before and after freezing oocytes, using ART to conceive with and
without stored oocytes, experiencing pregnancy loss or abortion and
having live births. The six women who had used their stored oocytes
reported mixed outcomes: oocytes that did not survive thawing,
repeated embryo transfers without achieving pregnancy, miscarriage
and births. It should be noted that the ‘slow’ freezing method had
been used for the six respondents who had used their stored oocytes.
It is possible that women who stored oocytes after the introduction of
vitrification as the freezing method in 2012 will have a greater chance
of having a baby if they use their stored oocytes. Nevertheless, these
results demonstrate the diverse potential reproductive outcomes and
reproductive heterogeneity of women who freeze oocytes for non-
medical reasons. Although they have different demographic and med-
ical characteristics and reasons for cryopreserving oocytes, the limited
evidence suggests that the rate of utilization of stored material among
women who freeze oocytes or embryos before cancer treatment is
also low and that most post-treatment pregnancies occur spontan-
eously or as a result of ART with fresh oocytes (Barcroft et al., 2013;
Dahhan et al., 2014).
Most women in this survey (with or without children) still wanted to
have a child in the future but only one in five stated that they definitely
intended to use their stored oocytes. Furthermore, the number of chil-
dren respondents ideally would have liked was considerably higher
than the number of children they expected to have, suggesting unful-
filled parenthood aspirations. These results are consistent with those
of Stoop et al. (2015) who found that almost all of the 86 women they
interviewed still wished for a child but only about half expected to use
their stored oocytes.
We are aware of arguments that, for women to be able to make
informed decisions about oocyte freezing, the consent process must
include information about success rates by age-group (Harwood,
2015) and that the information should be indication specific (Cil and
Seli, 2013). Data from oocyte donation programmes indicate that
oocyte cryopreservation in that context achieves satisfactory preg-
nancy rates with one programme reporting a 6.5% oocyte-to-baby
rate (Cobo et al., 2015). Evidence about the rate of usage and out-
comes from using cryopreserved oocytes for medical indications is
emerging but is still very limited (Argyle et al., 2016; Kato, 2016).
Because their characteristics are likely to differ, it is questionable
whether data from women using cryopreserved donor oocytes or
women cryopreserving oocytes for medical reasons can be extrapo-
lated to women who freeze oocytes for non-medical reasons. Since
only six of our respondents had used their stored oocytes, it is not
possible to draw conclusions about the efficacy of oocyte cryopreser-
vation. This requires systematic collection, compilation and reporting
of national and international data. We endorse the recommendation
that data on oocyte cryopreservation outcomes should be included in
the data that clinics are required to report to bodies that compile ART
data in order to ‘yield better and more generalizable data’ (Harwood,
2015). We would add that evidence-based information about the pro-
portions of women who return to use their stored oocytes, reasons
for not using them, and overall reproductive outcomes for women
who store oocytes for non-medical reasons might help women to
make more informed decisions about whether to freeze oocytes.
Women who consider oocyte cryopreservation for non-medical rea-
sons need detailed, individualized information, which takes into account
the woman’s age and other circumstances that may affect the possible
outcomes of the procedure, in pre-treatment counselling including that
oocytes may not be recovered, there may be no oocytes suitable for
cryopreservation, the oocytes may remain unused, that using stored
oocytes does not guarantee a baby, and that they may conceive spon-
taneously. This study contributes to the limited existing evidence about
the reproductive outcomes of women who freeze oocytes for non-
medical reasons and can be used when counselling women who con-
template storing oocytes to guard against age-related infertility.
