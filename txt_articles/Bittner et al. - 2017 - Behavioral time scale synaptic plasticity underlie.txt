plasticity underlies CA1 place fields

Learning is primarily mediated by activity-dependent modifications of synaptic strength within
neuronal circuits.We discovered that place fields in hippocampal area CA1 are produced by a
synaptic potentiation notably different from Hebbian plasticity. Place fields could be produced
in vivo in a single trial by potentiation of input that arrived seconds before and after complex
spiking.The potentiated synaptic input was not initially coincident with action potentials or
depolarization.This rule, named behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity, abruptly modifies inputs
that were neither causal nor close in time to postsynaptic activation. In slices, five pairings of
subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium (Ca2+) plateau potentials produced a large
potentiation with an asymmetric seconds-long time course.This plasticity efficiently stores
entire behavioral sequences within synaptic weights to produce predictive place cell activity.
T
he most influential theory concerning the
physiological basis of learning and memory
posits the following: If activity in a pre-
synaptic neuron “repeatedly or persistently
takes part in firing” a postsynaptic neuron,
the strength of their connections should be
increased (1). The two core elements of Hebb’s pos-
tulate, causality and repetition, have shaped syn-
aptic plasticity experiments and learning theories
for decades (2–5). Hebb’s rule, as implemented
throughdozensofessentiallycoincident activations
of pre- and postsynaptic neurons, has been pro-
posed to underlie autonomous or unsupervised
learning in a wide range of brain regions and
across multiple species (3–12). However, these
two core elements also produce some of the most
persistent challenges in biological learning, that
is, how can associations be formed over behavioral
time scales (seconds versus milliseconds) and in
just a few experiences (single versus dozens of
trials) to generate useful predictions of the future
(2, 3, 7, 11, 13–15).
Despite decades of research, there is little
direct evidence concerning the actual learning
rules in place within different brain regions. For
example, the hippocampus plays a role in many
forms of memory (16–18) and synaptic plasticity
was first observed and has been most intensively
studied there (6–8, 10). Yet, the plasticity rules
shaping hippocampal activity remain unknown,
and computational studies suggest standard rules
need modification (7, 10, 18).
We therefore determined the plasticity rules
that shape place-field formation in hippocampal
area CA1. New CA1 place fields can be rapidly
formed anywhere in a spatial environment when
the initiation of complex spiking by dendritic Ca2+
plateau potentials drives an increase in the
weights of excitatory synaptic inputs (19, 20). We
used intracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal
neurons of head-fixed mice running laps on a
linear-track treadmill(seesupplementary methods).
All recorded neurons initially were silent cells in
that they did not show any location-specific firing
for at least the first 5 min of the recording. After
this baseline period, plateau potential initiation
[either naturally occurring (n = 7) or experimen-
tally induced (n = 20)] produced a ramp-like de-
polarization of membrane potential (Vm ramp)
that was observed to drive place-field firing on
subsequent trials (19–22) (Fig. 1, A to C, and fig.
S1). The average number of trials containing
plateau potentials during the induction phase
was 1.4 ± 0.22 for naturally occurring and 5.1 ±
0.32 for experimentally induced place fields. The
induced Vm ramps extended back in time (mean
time to start of Vm ramp, 3.8 ± 0.2 s; n = 27; Fig.
1B and fig. S2) to locations along the track where
the postsynaptic cell did not exhibit any action
potential (AP) firing during the plasticity induc-
tion trials (average spatial firing rate for 180 cm
preceding plateau; 0.1 ± 0.05 Hz, n = 27; Fig. 1, A
to C, and fig. S2), or even somatic depolarization
compared to nonpotentiated regions (mean Vm for
initial 20 cm of Vm ramp, –60.3 ± 0.04 mV versus
preceding 20 cm, –59.6 ± 0.4 mV; P = 0.34; Fig. 1,
B and C, and fig. S2).
This suggests that the learning rule responsi-
ble for input potentiation could span a much
longer time (seconds) than predicted by standard
rules (tens of milliseconds) to include inputs that
were not directly involved in driving neuronal
firing. Because CA3 provides position-specific
place cell input to CA1 (23), a plasticity rule that
operates on seconds-long time scales predicts
that the faster mice run during the induction
trial, the wider the resulting Vm ramps (Fig. 1,
D to F). For a standard rule spanning only tens
of milliseconds, the distances covered would not
vary substantially (Fig. 1, E and F, and red line in
G). We looked at the relationship between the
width of the Vm ramp and the running speed
of the mouse during the induction trial(s), and
indeed, the faster the mouse ran during the
induction trial(s), the greater the Vm ramp width
(Fig. 1G). The slope of this relationship was on
the order of seconds [Fig. 1G, gray line, goodness
of fit (r2) = 0.76, m = 2.5 s], confirming the exis-
tence of a plasticity rule operating on a seconds-
long time scale (see supplementary methods).
Once the CA1 Vm ramp was established, ramp
width was not related to an animal’s running
speed during the trials that followed the induc-
tion, as expected for place cell firing (24) (average
width of slow trials versus fast trails; 125.4 ± 7.1
versus 126.5 ± 6.6 cm, n = 22; P = 0.62; Fig. 1H).
We next sought to quantitatively study the
shape of this synaptic plasticity rule and how
it relates in time to the plateau potential. We
deconvolved the Vm ramps from our intracellular
CA1 recordings with a synaptic input pattern
based on the movement of the animal during
trials containing plateau potentials (Fig. 2, A and
B; see supplementary methods). We observed an
asymmetric plasticity kernel that was two-orders-
of-magnitude longer than that expected for stan-
dard plasticity (kernel rise time extending for ~3 s,
decay time ~2 s) (Fig. 2, C to E). The analysis suc-
cessfully captured the experimentally observed
variation in Vm ramp width (fig. S3). These re-
sults indicate that CA1 place cells are produced
by a learning rule that asymmetrically projects
for seconds in both directions around the post-
synaptic activation that induced the plasticity
(fig. S4). This time course allows inputs that were
neither directly causal nor even temporally con-
tiguous with postsynaptic activation (either APs
or plateau potentials) to become potentiated, and
the magnitude of this potentiation permits this to
occur without substantial repetition. The time
course also produces Vm depolarizations that have
a predictive quality, in that they peak and have a
center of mass well before the actual induction
location (fig. S1, see supplementary methods). The
rule that shapes activity in area CA1 thus does not
conform to Hebb’s postulate.
To determine if the above plasticity rule could
be observed under more realistic model conditions,
we constructed and optimized a biophysically
detailed model and attempted to fully account
for the experimental data. In this model, a local
signal that rises and decays with a slow time course
(trise = 212.9 ± 38.8 ms, tdecay = 1196.4 ± 170.9 ms)
is generated at each activated synapse even though
the input remains subthreshold for output. This
signal on its own does not result in synaptic poten-
tiation (2). However, a second more global signal
(trise = 101.5 ± 21.1 ms, tdecay = 454.8 ± 76.8 ms)
is produced by dendritic plateau potentials, and
the overlap between the local and global signals
determines the degree of synaptic weight change
at each input (Fig. 2F and fig. S5). The plasticity
produced in this model was asymmetric with
respect to the plateau potential and covered a
similarly long duration time span (rise time = ~4 s,
decay time = ~3 s; Fig. 2G), as found in the above
nonparametric analysis. The model could recapit-
ulate the variation in all observed features of the
induced Vm ramps (Fig. 2H and fig. S5), whereas
an alternative version that used short duration

 local and global signals (trise = 10 ms, tdecay =
100 ms) was not successful (Fig. 2H). Further, the
model makes obvious why long-duration plateaus
are far more effective than brief APs at generat-
ing a global signal capable of interacting with the
proposed local signal. We termed this new plas-
ticity behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity
(BTSP).
Because no such synaptic plasticity has been
reported for CA1 pyramidal neurons, or any cor-
tical cell type, we explored whether this phe-
nomenon could be reproduced in hippocampal
slice preparations from adult mice. We devised
whole-cell patch-clamp conditions using Cs2+
internal solutions to enable the initiation of
plateau potentials independent of synaptic input
(25) (see supplementary methods). Area CA3 was
removed from the slices to silence spontaneous
activity, and electrical stimulation of stratum
radiatum axons was used to simulate “spatially
tuned” subthreshold synaptic inputs onto CA1
pyramidal cells (10 synaptic stimuli delivered
at 10 Hz). This was paired with a postsynaptic
plateau potential that was generated through
somatic current injection alone (300 ms, 300- to
600-pA current injection) and delivered either
synchronously or separated in time with intervals
ranging from Dt = –3250 ms (presynaptic before
postsynaptic) to Dt = +2250 ms (presynaptic after
postsynaptic) in different neurons (n = 58; Fig. 3,
A to F, and figs. S6 and S7). We used only five
pairings (15-s interval; average lap time = 15.4 ±
1.7 s, n = 20) to mirror the plasticity seen in
behaving animals, which could be produced in as
few as one induction. Changes in synapse strength
were quantified with paired-pulse excitatory post-
synapticpotentials(EPSPs)(50msinterval;0.05Hz)
that were monitored for a baseline period of
10 to 15 min (first EPSP amplitude = 2.4 ± 0.11 mV,
n = 63) and for up to 60 min following induction
(fig. S6C). We observed a large, approximately
threefold potentiation (3.12 ± 0.11, n = 4) upon
coincident stimulation (Dt = 0 ms) that decayed
gradually with Dt, remaining significant for
nearly 4 s in the backward Dt direction (pre-
synaptic before postsynaptic: tb = 1.31 ± 0.22 s
SD, n = 42) and more than 2 s in the forward
Dt direction (postsynaptic before presynaptic:
tf = 0.69 ± 0.11 s SD, n = 20) (Fig. 3G and figs.
S6 and S7). Potentiation stabilized minutes
after induction and persisted for the duration
of the recordings (Fig. 3, C and D, and figs. S6 and
S7). No changes in input resistance were observed
(baseline: 83.8 ± 2.9 MW; postpairing: 82.2 ±
2.6 MW; n = 58, P = 0.69 paired two-tailed t test
for intervals ±1500 ms; Fig. 3H). A relatively
small decrease in paired-pulse facilitation, though
statistically significant (baseline: 2.14 ± 0.08;
postpairing: 1.99 ± 0.07; n = 58, P = 0.01 paired
two-tailed t test for intervals ±1500 ms; Fig. 3H),
suggests a predominantly postsynaptic mecha-
nism of action. BTSP was pathway specific, as a
second nonstimulated control pathway did not
significantly potentiate following application of
the pairing protocol to a test pathway (500 ms
interval; control path: 1.08 ± 0.19 postpairing/
baseline, n = 6, P = 0.21; test path: 1.87 ± 0.26
postpairing/baseline, n = 6, P = 0.0005; fig. S8).
We next tested the pharmacological sensitivity
of BTSP to identify the main molecular compo-
nents involved. BTSP was sensitive to N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade because
20 mM D-aminophosphovalerate (D-APV) reduced
the amplitude of the potentiation at the –750-ms
pairing interval by 84% (control: 2.16 ± 0.15;
drug: 1.19 ± 0.03; n = 6, P = 0.00033) (Fig. 4, A
and B). The potentiation remaining after D-APV
treatment, particularly just after pairing, may be
responsible for the degraded, unstable place
fields reported in novel spatial environments
during NMDAR antagonism (26). The L-type
Ca2+ channel blocker, nimodipine (10 mM), also
inhibited the potentiation at this same pairing
interval (73% inhibition; control: 2.16 ± 0.15;
drug: 1.31 ± 0.04; n = 6, P = 0.0011) (Fig. 4, A
and B). The blockade of potentiation by D-APV
and nimodipine was not mediated by a reduced
duration of the induction plateau potentials
(plateau duration: control, 204.7 ± 18.0 ms,
n = 15; nimodipine: 236.7 ± 29.6 ms, n = 6, P =
0.33; D-APV: 200.5 ms, n = 6, P = 0.91) (Fig. 4C).
A similar pharmacological profile has been re-
ported for another form of long-term potentia-
tion induced by dendritic spikes in CA1 pyramidal
neurons (27). Finally, we examined the effect of
nimodipine on place-field induction during in
vivo recordings. Pressure application of nimo-
dipine around the neuron under study (see sup-
plementary methods) significantly reduced the
amplitude of the Vm ramp induced by plateau-
potential initiation compared to vehicle controls

 (Vm ramp amplitude: vehicle, 6.2 ± 1.3 mV, n =
6; 5 mM nimodipine, 1.3 ± 0.4 mV, n = 5; P =
0.042) (Fig. 4, D and E). Plateau-potential dura-
tion was likewise unchanged by nimodipine
under these conditions (control: 264.7 ± 15.3 ms,
n = 6; nimodipine: 250.6 ± 16.7 ms, n = 5, P = 0.41)
(Fig. 4F). These experimental results directly link
BTSP with place-field formation in area CA1.
They also illuminate the potential mechanisms
generating the long-duration signals present
in the above realistic model (28–30). However,
extensive future studies are needed to determine
the specific signaling pathways involved.
A noteworthy type of synaptic plasticity under-
lies neuronal activity in hippocampal area CA1.
Although BTSP exhibits associativity and speci-
ficity, it nevertheless leads to the potentiation of
inputs that are neither causal nor even close in
time with complex spiking. Moreover, the mag-
nitude of the induced plasticity is such that it can
abruptly form new place fields in just a single
trial. We speculate that complex spiking may be
enhanced by unfamiliar events, rewards, or
punishments. Hence, the BTSP induction mech-
anism may operate as an instructive-type signal,
promoting learning that is neither autonomous
nor correlative.
BTSP can rapidly store the entire sequence of
events that occurred for several seconds before and
after plateau-potential initiation within the synap-
tic weights of area CA1. The potent, asymmetric
seconds-long plasticity produces, within a single
run, place-field firing that peaks before the lo-
cation where complex spiking occurred, providing
a predictive signal of behaviorally relevant events
(fig. S9). Such experience-dependent tailoring
of the CA1 representation by BTSP could create
network-level overrepresentations of particu-
larly important locations as well as the activation
of specific trajectories toward reward locations
observed during different phases of exploration
(31–34). In addition, various forms of hippocampal-
dependent learning such as that observed during
episodic memory and trace conditioning would
greatlybenefitfromastoragemechanismoperating
on seconds-long time scales (35, 36). More gen-
erally, BTSP represents a plausible biophysical
implementation of plasticity rules proposed in
numerous theoretical studies in systems neuro-
science and machine learning (2, 3, 7, 11, 13–15). In
particular, the linking of past synaptic input and
neuronal activation by dendritic plateaus alle-
viates the need for prolonged internal stimulus
representations (13–15). Thus, BTSP may provide
a more straightforward physiological basis for
many types of learning than plasticity that explicitly
conforms to Hebb’s postulate.

Fig. 4. Pharmacology of BTSP and place-field formation. (A) Effect of
20 mM D-APV (left) and 10 mM nimodipine (right). Average EPSP amplitude
(normalized to baseline; ±SEM) for population of neurons that received
–750-ms interval induction protocol. Red line is mean for control [from (C)].
Gray lines are individual neurons. (B) Plot of EPSP amplitude (20 min
postpairing/baseline) for control (con.), nimodipine (nim.), and D-APV
conditions. *P = 0.0011; **P = 0.00033. Number of cells in each group shown
in parentheses. (C) Plot of average plateau-potential duration during the
induction protocol for control, nimodipine, and D-APV conditions. No statistical
differences were observed. (D) Vm ramp from individual neurons (gray traces)
and the population average for control (left; pressure application of external
solution containing vehicle) and for drug conditions (right; external solution
containing 5 mM nimodipine). (E) Plot of Vm ramp amplitude induced for control
and nimodipine conditions. *P = 0.042. (F) Plot of average plateau-potential
duration during the induction protocol for control and nimodipine conditions.
No statistical differences were observed.
